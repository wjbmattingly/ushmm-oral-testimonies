Interview with Stefan Czyzewski 
September 24, 1998 
Beginning Tape One, Side A 
Question: United States Holocaust Memo ri
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with Stefan Czyzew
ski, conducted by Katie Davis, on September 
14th, 1998, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This
 is a follow up interview to a USHMM 
videotaped interview, conducted with Stef
an Czyzewski, April 8th, 1998. The United 
States Holocaust Memo rial Museum grat
efully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for 
making this interview possible. This is 
tape number one, side A. Good mo rning. 
Answer: Good mo rning. 
Q: I wonder if we can begin with you just stating your name and telling us whether or 

not you ever spelled it differently? 

A: Yes. My name is Stefan Czyzewski a
nd I never spelled it differently, except for 
duration of 1941 to ‚45, I carried a different 
last name and I was a-at that time, I was 
Stefan Grot, G-r-o-t. And reason for change, that none of us in the -- in my fighting 

group carried his own name. In mo st case
s, we just had one word pseudonym -- 

pseudoname. In my  case, I carried a full name, but my  last name was different from 

the original. 

Q: Before we get to your work in your 
fighting group in your resistance, during the 
war, I™ve heard that your father hid a Jewish
 family, or hid Jews and I wonder if you 
can tell us that?

A: Yes, we -- my father hid a friend, w
hose name was Ithzac Visipka and his two 
children. One was about eight, one was about
 11, a boy and a girl. And the tragedy of 
my father™s life was that they were killed, 
very close to the end of the war. During one 
of the pacifications, Mr. Visipka just couldn™t 
stand it, sitting in  hiding, so he took off 
and ran and was caught in a field -- in open 
field by pacification squad, the German SS 
group and he was killed and his children were k
illed. And the bad part of it is, too, that 
they were shot only once and wer -- they
 were dying for a long, long time. They 
refused to shoot them second time. And of
 course, later on, they came and took my  
father. Somebody apparently reported and my  
father, he had to dig a grave for them 
and bury them. And they also were going to 
shoot my  father -- father, with them, but 
my  father was a foxy old man, so before he we
nt there, he went into a closet, he pulled 
ours -- out his Isen cross that the Germans 
gave him in the first World War,  pinned it 
up on his jacket and dug the hole. After he bur
ied this -- I mean, after he laid these 
people in, he even put his jacket over their faces. And they said, ﬁNow it™s your turn.ﬂ 
So he turned around and said, ﬁDo you want to
 kill a German hero?ﬂ So they looked, 
and he had a -- his citation with him, in hi
s pocket. They read the citation and said, 
ﬁOld man, you escaped this time. Don™t let 
that happen again.ﬂ And they let him go. 
Q: Can you tell us how your father came to 
hide them? What were the circumstances 
that led to this? Did -- did they --

A: Was very -- very simp le. Everybody -- 
just about everybody I knew was hiding a 
Jewish person or two or three. Just about
 everybody in our -- in our village -- in our 
village of 52 household, we 
had probably 20 or 30 Jewish 
people being hidden. Some 
survived, some did not. One person that we
 hid, did survive. She was a young Jewish 
woman and she did survive. Later on she se
rved in the Polish government. I don™t -- I 
know her name was Maria, but I don™t re -- 
know her -- never knew her last name. She 
was a friend of Mr. Jebbe, who was a tailor, who was also with us for some time, but 

he was killed during one of the pacifications. 

Q: So this hiding occurred in Leshganorra, your village? 

A: Leshnagorra, yes. 

Q: Do you know when it began, the hiding of
 th-the father and the two children? 
A: It began in late 1941, when the ghetto
s were established. Mr. Visipka™s wife 
decided not to go in hiding. She decided to 
go to the ghe -- stay in ghetto and she even 
decided to go to the Warsaw ghetto, where 
she perished, apparently. But Mr. Visipka 
did not want to stay in ghetto, since he wa
s used to roaming the villages. Before the 
war, he carried bundle for his mo ther, Go
lda, who was a peddler and he knew 
everybody and everybody knew Mr. Visipka. So 
he thought that he would survive 

among the Polish people. 

Q: Do you know if he came to your father a
nd asked him, or if your father offered?

A: I don™t think he ever asked. He came one night and father -- he -- we talk and he -- 
father and he talked and father found him 
a place to hide and when I came back from 
the Middle East, in fall of 1941, I made
 Mr. Visipka a good hiding place. And he 
stayed there forever and a day.  

Q: So you made the hiding place? How did you do it, tell us? 

A: There was an big attic, huge, huge attic above the cow barn. And the attic was full 

of straw, bundles of straw. So, I made a little
 trap door in a ceiling of the barn and I 
made a chamber among the straw above that trap door. It was nice and warm. It was 

stinky, of course, but who cared about sti
nk at that time? And Mr. Visipka stayed 
there, on and off. He would go places. He -- 
we would go to work in a field for some 

of the farmers who had so-called farms on 
outskirts. He could not work on our farm, 
because our farm was within a village and 
too many people would have seen him. So 
he went to work for people who -- who were
 all alone somewhere on the side of -- on 
the edge of the forest. And he would stay and work with them. 
Then they will come 
back, he will get -- bring some food. And of
 course, food was never short in our place, 
so he didn™t have to worry about that.  

Q: Were you there when he was discovered and killed? 

A: No, I was not. I was with my fighting unit.
 But I heard story after I came back. My 
father wouldn™t talk, but some people talked. 

Q: You father wouldn™t talk about it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023

A: No. He felt very bad about it. And we 
had a -- we had all kind of mo ments. Funny 
mo ments, laughing mo ments, was horribly sc
ared. We were worrying. There was one 
mo ment -- we were notified by somebody 
who knew about the pacification squad 
coming in, so we told Mr. Visipka, ﬁGet in
 and stay there and don™t peek out.ﬂ Well, 
Mr. Visipka left his children. He couldn™t st
and it, he ran away. Later on he said, ﬁI 
didn™t want to be found and ha
ve all of you killed.ﬂ So he came back next -- next day, 

wet, muddy, cold. And he said, ﬁNo panyan. 
I had three lucks. The first luck was the 
German didn™t kill me. The second luck wa 
-- luck was, your dog didn™t eat me.ﬂ We 
had a big, big dog. ﬁAnd the third luck was,
 I didn™t drown in the mud.ﬂ He ran into 
the forest, just about 200 feet from our barn 
and hid in the mud there. He said, ﬁThe 
third -- third luck was, I did not drown in the mud.ﬂ 

Q: An-and -- and the woman, Maria, who stay
ed with you, was she staying at the same 
time and where was she staying? 

A: She was staying just about the same tim
e and even before and after. She did not 
stay with us permanently, but she would come
 and stay for a week or two and then she 
would go her own way. We didn™t want to 
know where she went and she didn™t want 
to tell us where she went. She apparently 
had many places to stay. And after the war, 
she worked for the Secretary 
of the Interior, Mr. Minz, in the Polish government. And 
she was twice, I think, instrumental in
 saving my father from the Communists. 
Q: What do you -- what do you know about th
at? Can you tell us anything about that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023

A: I didn™t know very mu ch, because I wasn™t
 there, but later on my  sister brought me 
there. They wanted my  father
 to join the collective and he
 said, ﬁDamn you, forget it.ﬂ 
So, they had a local Communist who was 
forcing and encouraging everybody to join 
the collective, give the farm aw
ay. So my father went and th
reaten him, so they ha-had 
him arrested and beat him up and of cour
se, Maria came and saved him. And a couple 
weeks later, somebody went out at night a
nd shot up the house of the person who was 
forcing everybody into it, and I know who that
 was. My father was a [indecipherable] 
was short-temp ered. He has a gun, he 
had a machine gun. He could do almo st 
anything, within reason. 

Q: Your father did that? 

A: Yes, of course. Of course, he was arrested immediately after that. But he was 

released and the police -- for their pains, 
the local militia almost got executed by the 
Soviet general. 

Q: Why did they almo st get executed? 

A: Well, during the war, there was a dirty ol
d -- dirty old, well, he was -- looked old, 

he was in his probably late 20™s or early 30™s -- Russian hiding with us for man -- I 

mean, for weeks and months, at times. A
nd my  father spoke Russian very well, 
because he served in south imperial army, 
and they became friends, and that Ivan, as 
we called him, came and went. After the 
war, we discovered that he led all the 
Communist partisans in our territory and he 
was sa -- and he was a general in charge 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
8
 
 
 
of an Russian pantzer division in a town
 of Minsk, which was about 10 - 15 miles 
from our farm. So, when my  father was arrested second time, my  sister went and tried 
to talk to the man in charge in Minsk. And 
of course, they wouldn™t let her talk to him, 
but eventually she prevailed.
 She just sat down and wouldn™t move and talked to Ivan 
Ivanovitch. I don™t know if it was his real name or not. He came storming in, in an 

army car with two soldiers and a -- and a driver and he came to the county village. He 

took the police, put them against the wall and 
ta -- got my  father out of jail and said, 
ﬁYanna, do you want to shoot those son of a 
bitches?ﬂ And father said, ﬁOh, no, they 
do their work. But they beat me up, so I want
 to hit them few times.ﬂ So, he hit them 
few times. And they were warned, they 
were told, ﬁIf you ever happen -- anything 
happens to John ever, I™ll come and shoot 
you, you [indecipherable] and so and so.ﬂ  
Q: So there was a lot going on at your house. 

A: Well, of course. We had a lively life. 

Q: I-It was -- it seems that it was a safe house for at least two Jewish families -- well, 

one family, one woman, and then a Communist
 partisan, who happened to turn out to 
be an important leader? 

A: Yes, it was. Of course, there were othe
r people who came in and out, hiding. People 
from the Polish underground, some of my  boys 
who were hurt, who were shot, stayed 
for a few days, couple weeks. As you -- as I 
mentioned previously, I think my  mo ther -
- my mother, my grandmother, was a witc
h doctor. She had weeds, she -- she -- she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023

had herbs, she had all kind of stuff and sh
e could cure almo st 
anybody out of anything. 
She couldn™t grow legs or arms, but she 
could do almo st anythi
ng else. So we had 
many wounded partisans come and stay and hide.  
Q: So, if something happened in your fi
ghting group and someone was injured, you 
would e -- you might take them to your house or tell them how to get there? 

A: Yes, we did. 

Q: And then where would they
 actually stay, in the house? 
A: Oh, we had a small closet, we had a ki
nd of a storeroom. Course we had a barn 
with all kind of hid-hid-hiding pla
ces, they could stay there, too. 

Q: And the word never got around that th
is house of the Czyzewski™s was a house 
where there were many partisans in and out and -- 

A: Well, the wor -- 

Q: Jews hiding and -- 

A: -- the words got around and we had many 
visits from the Schultz Politsi, even 
people from the Einsatzgruppen came to vi
sit few times. They beat my  father, 
occasionally. But never shot -- never killed him.  

Q: Did your father or your sisters ever ta
lk about feeling afraid during this times? 
A: Yes, they were. They we
re shitty scared at times. 
Q: How did they tell you that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
10
 
 
 
A: Oh yes, we™re afraid, we shook. We crie
d, we yelled a lot wh-when they hit us. So 
they just left us alone and went away. 
Q: Your sisters were hit, also? 

A: My sisters were hit also, especially 
my  younger sister, who would te -- who would -
- who was outspoken. 

Q: I™d like to turn now, to f
ill in some gaps, turn now to your training as a -- as an 
underground fighter. And I™m talking about 
the period -- the six month period where 
you left Siberia and then you walked in to 
Iran. And I™m wondering if we could talk a 
little bit about that. What did the camp actu
ally look like when you finally got there? 

A: It was a tent city, close to Teheran, out in the desert. There was cold at night, there 

was hot during the day. The hamsen blew
 occasionally. The sto -- sandstorm blew 
occasionally. And the British fished out a 
small group of people and since my whole 

life practically went by seventeens, ther
e were 17 young Polish boys and there was a 
British -- Commander Thompson, we called him. 
He went -- he ran the guts out of us. 
We went on long marches, with heavy loads.
 We went infiltrate and exfiltrating from 
objects -- military objects -- camps. 

Q: What do you mean by that, infiltrating? 

A: Sneaking in and sneaki
ng out, without being caught. 

Q: For instance, how would he have
 you do that, in a training exercise? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
11
 
 
 
A: We would burrow under the wires. The 
camp had wi -- barbed wire round. We 
would get in, we would steal things to te -- 
to s -- to tell that we were in. And the camp 
guards, who had put an especial -- they we
re receive special efforts that somebody is 
going to infiltrate here and we were caught 
couple times, but we were caught about twi 
-- two out of 10 times. Most of the time we 
were lucky to get in and get out without 
being caught.  
Q: So you would be outside the camp and you 
would have a mission to sneak in, steal 
something and sneak back out? 

A: Yes. And at times we just went in 
carrying nothing and times we came -- we went 
in carrying arms. At times we went in carry
ing heavy loads, in preparation for later 
times, when we had to carry explosives, 
things. And we went on long marches, we 
went on a -- we took in a -- took part in a fi
refights. We took part in firefights being 
surrounded by superior forces. And that really 
helped us later on, when I came back to 
Poland. 

Q: What -- what strategies were you learni
ng in those exercises? What do you do when 
you™re surrounded by superior forces? 

A: You divide your group in two or three 
subgroups. And one groups
 opens heavy fire 
when the -- the other group proceeds ahead of 
it. Then this -- then the group that went 
ahead of you opens heavy fire and you catc
h up with it. And then in -- both of you 
open heavy fire in every direction when 
the third lit -- group comes to you. And for a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
12
 
 
 
time we made efforts not to get surrounded 
by the Einsatzgruppen that we went to 
fight. Later on, when we -- when we receiv
ed our good armament, especially after we 
bought whole lot of -- after we bought a whol
e lot of Schmizers from a German supply 
officers, were so heavily ar
med, that the Germans had no 
chance with us, whatsoever. 
As I mentioned in my  previous interv
iew, the 75 to 120 people in a German 
Einsatzgruppen would have four automatic 
weapons and rest would be manual rifles. 
My group of 17 plus two, carried 27 Schmi
zers, because 10 of my  boys did not trust 
the damn  German weapon, they wanted to have
 two. So, we had a su-surplus of it, so 
each of them carried two. And we had such
 a enormous firepower that he, on purpose 
wanted to be surrounded so we could get into
 fire -- a real firefight and get out of it 
and well, knock out mo re people than we normally would have. 
Q: In the training sessions  though, what 
kind of ammunition were you firing? Was it 
live or blank? 

A: We always used live ammunition. Work
 it -- were -- were wounded sometime, but 
it was realistic, we always used live amm
unition. If you stuck your neck -- head too 

far, you got hit. So you don™t. You keep your head down.  

Q: Did anyone ever get killed in training? 

A: Yes. I™m -- I don™t want to talk about it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
13
 
 
 
Q: You mentioned that when you first got th
ere, there was a period of indoctrination, 
psychological or philosophical. What -- what 
-- what were you learning in that period -
- 
A: Was it in -- 

Q: -- from the British? 

A: -- in a Soviet camp, or in -- 

Q: Not in the Soviet camp -- 

A: -- in British. 

Q: -- in the British camp, when you were
 being indoctrinated to become an 

underground fighter. What was the ph
ilosophy that you were being taught? 
A: Well the -- first of all, the British wanted
 to re-brainwash us after we had been 
brainwashed by the Communists, which didn™t 
take very long. And later on, we had 
British and we had Polish office -- political o
fficers coming and talking to us, invoking 
great Polish patriotism, which was unnecessary. 
We were too patriotic as it was. As a 
matter of fact, we were chauvinistic. But 
mostly it was the philosophy of hitting back, 
philosophy of saving people. Philosophy of 
making the Europe free of the Nazi 
scourge. 

Q: And was there any talk in this indoctr
ination period of what -- of what else you 
were fighting for? What was the end goal in terms of Poland? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
14
 
 
 
A: The end goal of -- was a free -- or free Po
land. Independent, free Poland. It turned 
otherwise, but we really wanted to fi
ght for the free, independent Poland.  
Q: And wa -- was the training camp allied 
with any of the underground movements? In 
other words, you were training in -- in Ira
n. Were they telling you, we want you to 
connect, when you get back to Poland, with
 one of these specific underground armies? 
A: It was suggested, but it was not told to. When we came back, the mo st powerful 
group was the ZWZ and we joined it for a time. Then, that was evolving into the home 

army, the AK. And also in the NSZ, the nati
onals armed forces. So some of us -- some 
of us were given groups of fighters from either AK or NSZ and in my  case, my  

sympathies were with -- were with NSZ a
nd they gave me -- supplied me with some 
ammunitions, some arms, some explosives a
nd gave me 17 people, plus two. That was 
that ti -- 

Q: You were going to say, I think 
you were saying it was a right wing? 
A: It was a right wing Polish underground. 

Q: And I want to talk mo re about that, but 
I just want to get clear on one thing. When 
you say that it was suggested that you make 
a connection to a certain group, what -- 

what were your leaders in the British tr
aining camp? Which group were they guiding 
you towards? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
15
 
 
 
A: The -- not the British, but the Polish po
litical officers were guiding us toward the 
present and the future home army , becaus
e the home army  was under jurisdiction of 
the Polish government in exile in Great Britain. 
Q: And how would they suggest? What would they say? 

A: Well, they would -- they would talk a lo
t about it. This is probably the best middle 
of the way group. They don™t discrimina te against anybody and they don™t fight -- 

fight any other group, they even tolerate 
the Socialist, Communists. And this is 
probably the future of Poland, we will have 
to live with that, Soviet Russia. And this 
probab -- this government probably will be th
e most likely to survive and continue. 
And we were told -- also told -- we were 
warned against my future, NSZ, those people 
have no future because the Soviet Russia will 
never allow it -- them to exist. But, of 
course, if you are 17 and 18, you don™t 
believe it, you are omnipotent.  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning of Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United 
States Holocaust Memorial Muse-Museum 
interview with Stefan Czyzewski and this is
 tape number one, side B. If you could just 

tell us a little bit more about your persona
l allegiance to the underground group that -- 

that you chose, the NSZ? 

A: They just happens -- happened almo st by 
happenstance. They were in ma -- in a 
neighborhood where I was. I was available, th
ey were receptive. The AK, the army  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
16
 
 
 
akaioba already had a group like mine from 
that neighborhood. They took one of my  
friends who came with me, as a leader. And the NSZ people had better armament that 

they could provide us with and also they 
were very mu ch against the Soviet Union. 
They hated the damn  Communists. And of c
ourse, after spe -- having spent a year in a 
Soviet prison camp, I didn™t like them mu ch
 either. So, that was probably kind of a 
comb ination of reasons why I did join the NSZ. 

Q: And as you™ve described and y-y-you described them so
metimes as right wing and 
in fact, in some cases, they were known fo
r being very anti-Semitic. What were your 
thoughts about that? 

A: That was probably the only aspect that
 I didn™t cherish. Also, in my very 
neighborhood, in my  very group, we were not
. As I previously mentioned, I had two 
people in my  group who survived the whole sc
hmier. Out of the four, who are left out 
of the 20, two of them were Jewish boys. Isaac One and Isaac Two. And we had -- I 

have known another probably half a dozen
 Jewish young men who were in a group. 
Some even were in a command. So even
 though the NSZ was at times quite anti-
Semitic, everybody had a Jew he liked. And 
he wou -- whom he would protect and 
save and wanted him to come and fight with him.  

Q: Tell us, how did the group express it™s an
ti-Semitism, if in fact, sometimes Jews 
were in the group? How was it expressed, the anti-Semitism? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
17
 
 
 
A: In mo st cases -- in my  group, we never 
talked about it. We -- our talk was always 
how to hit the da-damn -- damn  Germans and hora and whit and how to be mo st 
effective. And my  two Jewish boys had con 
-- had connection with people in a ghetto -
- in neighboring ghettos in two or three 
towns and had some conva -- kind of a 
uncanny ability or foresight. If we wanted so
metime to go one way, they would -- one 
of them would say, ﬁWalcheem, no we don™t 
want to go that way, we want to go 
around.ﬂ So we went around and we discovere
d later on if we went that way, we 
would have gotten knocked out. So it wa
s mo re on a personal level than on a 

ideological level. They trusted you, you trusted them. And sometime you trusted them 

mo re than you tru-trusted your -- your -- your own Polack in your group. It was mo stly 

personal and we hardly ever talked ideol
ogy during our fights, dur
ing our existence -- 
throughout our existence.  

Q: I want to go back a little bit, to the tr
aining camp. You have told us about how you 
learned how to infiltrate. How did you learn how
 to -- for instance, to do certain acts of 
sabotage, how did you practice them? Perhaps 
derailing a train, if you could explain to 
us how they gave you that training? 

A: The sabotage part of it was probably the 
mo st extens-extensive and took the longest 
time. They taught us techniques -- how 
to use old dynamite, which was the only 
explosive that we could fi -- get in Poland 
for a long, long time. And how to build that 
plate -- carry and put metal plate on the -- 
under the explosives, under the rail. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
18
 
 
 
taught us, if they -- we did not have explos
ives, they tol -- they trained us how to 
loosen up a rail to detrain a train. But in mo st cases, the mo st effective would have 
been explosives. They told us how to us
e batteries and since we did not have good 
equipment, we -- you just hung up to two 
little wires in your hand. Your hand shook 
and you wondered if y -- if you are going to bl
ow the damn  thing on time or after the 
train went by, which sometime it happened. My commander was mad at me at ev -- 

every time I missed that thing, he wanted to
 court martial and we -- he threatened to 
put me against the wall and shoot me if I misse
d. But of course, later on he told me, ﬁI 

would never shoot you, because you are us
eful. You are a good tool.ﬂ Well, I don™t 
know if I was a good tool or not, but I tried my
 darnest. They told us how to attach 
explosive to doors or to gates or to the br
ick wall. How to remove a brick from a brick 
wall, surrounding an object or how to dig out
 quickly, break out of a brick building 
and put explosives in it. And how to stretc
h the wire, how to use -- how to use fuse. 
How long each fuse would burn -- how ma
ny feet per minute it would burn. How 
many meters per a minute it would burn. Ho w far you had to be from an objective if 

you blow it up. Which side of the object 
you were blowing up, 
you were supposed to 
be on, if possible. If it™s not possible, how to
 hide, what to hide in, how to best hide. 
The best pla -- best place to hide was to di
g a foxhole. You didn™t have time to dig the 
foxhole, so you hi -- you were kind of in a 
halfway quandary and gr
eat excitement and 
being scared and being perplexed. And strange enough, I can™
t believe it, but mo st of

the times, perhaps seven out of 10, maybe 
eight, sometime nine out of 10, we were 
lucky and effective. 
Q: Were you often, when you did go through 
with an action and blow something up, 

were you often within hearing distance of it? 

A: We were always within hearing distan
ce. Sometime we were within -- within a 
harm distance of it, except that if you put 
yourself behind a big stone or in a small 
ditch or behind another wall, you were 
not harmed. But sometime you were. I had 
bricks -- brick wall fall on me. The object 
was probably 200 feet from where I was, 
that blown up and I was hiding behind a good br
ick wall that turned out not to be a 
great brick wall, because if fell apart and I got knocked out, practically. 

Q: You had said in your prior interview 
that the Polish and the British commanders 
chose you the best of the best. When they sa
id you were ready, was it clear -- what did 
they tell you and were they putting you, St
efan Czyzewski up as a commander that 
when you got into Poland, you would command a unit, was that clear? 

A: That was clear, but I don™t think I men
tioned it to [indecipherable] of the best. 
Those 17 of us, all of us were the best. And 
we ca -- we were sent back to Poland with 
an understanding that when we reached ther
e, we are the only people who are trained 
and we automatically would assume command of small wet works groups.  

Q: That is what I meant -- 

A: Yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
20
 
 
 
Q: -- that the group was the best of the best.  
A: The groups a -- wa -- the -- was the best of the best.  

Q: So that you were, in essence, an elite
 group who had had more training than most, 
so that you could go back and then lead 17 other, smaller groups? 

A: Yes, that™s right. Yes, we -- we -- later 
on we did train some people in Poland, back 
in, especially after some of us got killed.
 We didn™t want to run out of people who 

knew enough. But resources were skimpy. The 
territory was not always safe. So we 
had a difficult time training more people in  Poland in the system that the British 

developed for us. 

Q: Now, I know you™ve told us the story 
of how you got back into Poland and your 
crossing water, and the boat. Did you have in
s -- what were your instructions once you 

got into Poland? Where were you supposed
 to go? How were you supposed to know 
where to be? 

A: We were told to disperse and since we  -- individuals who are from a different part 

of a country were told they -- to go in
to your own territory where you know people, 
where people know you. Perhaps close to 
where your family is and search out 
underground groups and join them and tell 
them who you are and what you can do. 
Q: So tell us how you did that when you got
 back near to -- to Leshnagorra, your 
hometown, how did you do that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
21
 
 
 
A: Yes, I came to my hometown, I joined 
my family, I stayed 
with them and my 
friends from the original -- original group, the OP, the defenders of Poland, which was 
already incorporate into ZWZ, appro -- came 
to talk to me within probably two days 
after I came back and say, ﬁHey, [indeciphera
ble] want to rejoin?ﬂ ﬁWell, tell me who 
and horah.ﬂ So we had a few meetings with 
local people and then we went to meetings 
with the so-called overall command and we 
identified -- I mean, I was the only one, I 
identified myself and told them what I coul
d do. And if they had any -- had a job for 
me, all right, if not I will find somebody to join
 me. And of course, they accepted me. I 
went through interrogation. They, at that be
ginning did not trust me, but eventually we 

developed affinity. And after I told them
 what I went through and identified places 
where I was and the training I went through, 
then they tested me. They gave me -- I 
joined a small fighting group who went on a fe
w jobs. And I became an advisor to the 
young man who ran -- who led that group. And 
about -- within -- probably within two 
months, they gave me my  own group a
nd I became comp letely independent from 
everybody. I had supervision. I had a commande
r of the district to whom I reported 

and who collected information on what we di
d and who would provide
 us with places 
to hit. And that was on and on and on and on, until 1944. 

Q: What was your attitude when you first got
 back? You had all this training. Were 
you very eager to get going right away a
nd for people to recognize that you knew how 
to do this? What was your attitude about
 the process of being accepted?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
22
 
 
 
A: Yes. Well, first of all, I was cauti
ous. I didn™t know who was who and who might 
be working for the Germans. After I 
discovered that nobody was working for the 
Germans, except those who openly were Bolstoitch people, a supervisor or those who 
ran the county or those who collected taxes 
and those who collected food and items for 
the Germans. Then I was eager
 to join whoever I could, to join to go and fight. I 
wanted to -- I mean, I was bragging about no 
end, I told 10 times mo re than I knew. I 
never unlearned to exaggerate. I still don™t know 
how not to exaggerate. So what I say, 
sometime, you should take with a big handful 
of salt, because it may be exaggeration.  
Q: Tell us a little bit about actually bei
ng back home. Wasn™t it unusual for a -- a 
young Polish man to be home? In other words, 
wasn™t it suspicious that you had been 
away and wouldn™t that call attention 
to you, possibly as being an underground 

person? I™m wondering if you can explain th e atmo sphere to us. Could you, as a young 

Polish man, just walk around normally, or 
did it -- that raise questions for the 
Germans?  

A: Well, th-they -- 

Q: And make you -- 

A: -- they did not -- the Germans did not ha
ve a close supervision over a countryside. 
Ours was a small village, as I mentione
d previously, 52 household, built along the -- 

one long street and everybody knew everybody 
and mo st of the people were very 
patriotic. There were some people there who were memb ers of the home army . There 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
23
 
 
 
were some people who were memb ers -- I mean, young boy -- young men who are 
members of the NSZ. We™ve only had two pe
ople in our district, one from my village 
and one from a distant village, who were me
mbers of the AL, the Communist partisan 
underground. Two, a whole 
two out of about 25,000. 
Q: So did you carry false documents? Did you 
have some sort of cover of what you 

did? 

A: No, at that time -- at that time, I did 
not carry false documents. Before I came -- 
before I came, every Polish person would re
ceive a so-called cancarity -- a document 
with your picture on it. You live here, you a 
farmer, you are this, you are that and if 
you wa -- if you go anyplace, you had to carry this with you. So when I came back, a 

friendly person in an administration, made th
e cancarta for me with a pre-date, so I 

was just somebody who was here all the time,
 never left, never was any quar -- just a 
young peasant, living in a small village. Not 
exactly illiterate, but not exactly bright. 
And one who brags a lot and one who likes 
girls and goes to dances and go places and 
works hard on the farm. And of course, s
hortly after that, somebody apparently was 
reporting and the German police would come and look for me and of course, they 

never -- I was never in and they kept co
ming and pushing my  father around. He said, 
ﬁWhen you came first time here, he got scared 
of you so badly, he just ran away, never 

showed up again. I don™t know where he is.ﬂ So
 they would beat up my  father slightly, 
not badly. I mean, they didn™t break his 
bones, but they would make him black and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
24
 
 
 
blue and let be at it. And that was the dur
ation. I would come for a visit occasionally, 
talk to my  father and he would say a few 
things and he said, ﬁOkay, you can go back, 
give them hell.ﬂ That was -- kind of a -- became everyday life. Like a life in a 
concentration camp -- in a death camp  became everyday life -- normal everyday life, 

that also became normal, everyday life. 

Q: Did you have a small bag of things th at you always carried with you, since you 

were on the move so mu ch? 

A: Yes, I had a backpack. I 
carried my stuff with me. 
Q: And do you rememb er what was in that? 

A: One pair of underwear, one pair of socks.
 And of course I had my  Schmizer with 
me. I also had a good American six shooter. I cherished it, because it was so 

dependable. In a short encount -- in a -- in
 a close encounter, that was the best.  
Q: Do you rememb er the make of the gun? The six shooter? 

A: Actually, it was a ru -- it was a Russian 
nagant, n-a-g-a-n-t, but it was built like an 
American western six shooter. 

Q: So you had a German weapon and a Russian weapon. 

A: Russian weapon, I had the Russian naga
nt, and Russian nagant, you could bury it in 
the mud, pull it out and it would not malfunction. 

Q: Do you remember it -- what else was 
in that knapsack -- the little rucksack? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
25
 
 
 
A: Well, I carried couple books to read and 
I -- well, I had a towel, I had a piece of 
soap. I had a razor -- straight razor, which se
rved as a razor and a couple times I used 
it on somebody else. 

Q: As a weapon? 

A: Of course, yes. I was in couple close encounters and I used my  razor. 

Q: Do you want to tell us about that? 

A: Oh, I had it handy, I had it in my breas t pocket. Had a little pocket sewed up in my 

jacket and I had it always ready. Yes, the 
SS man that met me once on a dark street 
and tried to identify me and pulled out a gun. 

Q: Where was that? 

A: It was in Shedilsan, little town of Sh
edilsan, nearby -- oh, probably 30 miles from -- 
from my -- my -- from my village. 

Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your -- a little bit more about your commander? 

This is B dad -- 

A: The o -- dom -- Be Dom. 

Q: Be-Be Dom, the old oak. 

A: Yes. 

Q: How often did you see him? 

A: I would see him every six weeks, ever
y eight weeks. Sometime every two weeks. 
And I would get a -- it was a grapevine, ﬁHey, you are supposed to see -- go the Be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
26
 
 
 
Dom.ﬂ ﬁWhere?ﬂ ﬁWell, you go that place, or 
that farm or that village. Go to that 
house.ﬂ I would go to that place and there would be somebody waiting for me. He 
said, ﬁOkay, let™s go home.ﬂ So I would be 
taken to wherever he was, not the place 
where I was supposed to go first. And we™d 
have a talk and I would hand in my  report 
for the last two or three, four weeks, five 
weeks. He would give me one or two or three 
assignments and he would alway say, ﬁIf po
ssible. Do it if possible, but you better.ﬂ 
Q: Di -- were they written reports that you gave in, or verbal? 

A: Verbal. I wo -- they would be written. I 
would read them several times and I could 
even carry them for a day, but I would -- to 
destroy them, I would eat them mo st of the 
time.  

Q: Tell us a little bit more about him -- be -- as a commander, sometimes hearing you 

talk about him, he was very harsh on you. What was your feeling towards him, or you 

just -- 

A: I felt toward him like my grandfather. He
 was very harsh, he was foul mouthed. 
Oh, could he swear. He was almo st as ba
d as a -- as a good Albanian. Good Albanian 
can swear for 15 minutes and not repeat 
himself. Mr. Dom, I don™t know how long he 
could swear without repeating himself, but
 could he swear. And he would call me 
names and he would call -- call me horrible names and he was threaten me with 

execution every second time we met and then 
after we -- when we parted, he would 
give me a hug and we both cry.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
27
 
 
 
Q: How long was he your commander? 
A: The duration. From the fa
ll of 1941, until spring of 1944. 
Q: Did you ever meet him again? 

A: No. Never met him. Never knew who -- w ho he was. Never heard of him again. 

Q: Did you ask about him among friends? 

A: I asked about him. I asked about him. 
I don™t know what happened to him, if he 
survived, if he didn™t. By the 
way, he went on wet jobs, too. 
Q: He went on your jobs? 

A: No, he went -- 

Q: Oh, went -- wet -- 

A: -- he -- he went on -- 

Q: -- wet works? 

A: On wet works, also. He was not suppos
ed to. He was not supposed to, he was 
called on the carpet several times after he participated in -- in a -- in action. 

Q: Did he tell you why he did? 

A: [indecipherable] He said, ﬁI don™t want to be comp letely useless.ﬂ 

Q: How many actions do you th
ink you were involved in? 
A: I can™t count. 

Q: It™s that many? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
28
 
 
 
A: Some months, one a week. Sometime twice a week. Sometime once a month. 
Sometime once every two months. I couldn™
t count. 45 - 50, maybe 60, maybe mo re. 
Most of it -- most of it I obliterated. Most of
 them. I recall almost everything, but most 
of my  a -- mo st of our actions blend toge ther and mo st of them I don™t want to 

remember. They were bad.  

Q: Can you say what was bad about them? 

A: People mutilated, people wounded and scre
aming. People with their arms blown 
off. People with their legs blown off. People with belly wounds, spilling out. Some of 

my  people, some of the other people. One thing I know -- only rememb er, the -- my  

friend, whom I carried --

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Stefan Czyzewski. This is tape number two, side A. 
A: Yes, one person I remember -- I thi
nk I mentioned him previously. We were 
surrounded, we were in a -- in a firefight 
and we were running and I did get hit. The 
top of my  head, I did get practically scalped 
and he was hit in a side of a head. And of 
course, I didn™t know what happened to him, 
but I grabbed him and I ran with him. I 
don™t know how far it was, but it was a long 
distance. And he was about twice as 
heavy as I am -- as I was. And I carried him, his rucksack, his Schmizer. Then I 

dumped him and two of my  boys came and 
I said, ﬁCome on, let™s get him out of 

here.ﬂ We were out of the immediate danger. I said, ﬁCome on, let™s help him.ﬂ Man 

said, ﬁForget it.ﬂ His top of a head was bl
own off. That I remember quite vividly. 
Q: What had you been doing? What was the 
action that you were doing at that point? 
A: We were surrounded. We all -- we were
 surrounded almo st on purpose. We just let 
ourself be surrounded, we were trying our
 tactics with our new weapons. And it 
worked, except -- 

Q: Do you rememb er his name? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
30
 
 
 
A: I don™t. I think his name was Roman, but I 
couldn™t be sure. He wasn™t with us for a 
long time. He replaced somebody who got killed and -- but he was good and he and I 
became friends.  

Q: Early on, when you first take your comma nd, you talk -- you talked before about a 

period where you lost 11 men in two months
 and then you describe saying, ﬁLook, 
we™ve got to do some training if we want -- 
if we want to stop this.ﬂ And then you did 
do training and I™m wondering if you could te
ll us about what did you do with those 
men to get them in better shape? 

A: We did what we -- what was done to 
them in Persia, by the British. We went 
through all kind of eventualities, being su
rrounded. We called on a large group of the 
Enerzet and we -- they had places in forests 
-- camps in forests, so we would infiltrate 
into the camps and exfiltrate. We would 
go and blow up objects. We would -- had a 
firefight with them. Of course, live amm
unition and we were 
lucky, nobody got shot. 
Nobody got even scratched. And we would 
go -- go on forced marches at night. We 
would walk 10 - 15 - 20 miles with a full pack, 75 pounds. After that, we became 

almo st invincible. We were not losing -- we
ll, we were losing people, but maybe one 
every two or three months. But not 11 in two months.  

Q: What was your way of being with th
e -- the other troops that you commanded? 
How did you get them to do the work they had to do, which was dangerous? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
31
 
 
 
A: Well really, I didn™t command them. I was 
with them and I told them, ﬁIf you want 
to be effective, imitate me.ﬂ And they tried 
to. I told them, ﬁI just -- either as good or 
as bad as the rest of you, but I know someth
ing that you don™t. So, first of all, we will 
train,ﬂ as we did. ﬁAnd second of all, watc
h what I am doing, because some things I 
cannot explain.ﬂ Which -- some tried, some
 didn™t. Some were lucky and survived. 
Some were not lucky and did not survive. 

Q: Where do you think you got the self-confid
ence and immense courage it took to do 

many of these things? 

A: I got an e-enormous ego. My ego was 
10 times bigger than I was. And regardless 
how hopeless a time it was, it never was hopeless in my  estimation. And I think that 

courage and bravado is contagious. And c
ourage and bravado -- bravado, that was -- 
we lived upon it for the duration those two and a half years. 

Q: Tell us a little bit about just how you 
took care of yourself. Where did you sleep? 
How did you eat and bathe? When did you have time to do these things? 

A: Well, we were not as bad as the kirigas 
people in Siberia, who take a bath every six 
months if they have to or not. We did wash
 in rivers, in streams, in ponds. If we would 
stay in a farm on outskirts of a forest, we
 would take a hot bath. The family, they 
would boil a lot of water and put them in
 a big wooden tub and one by one -- we did 
not change water, forget it. If we got a big 
tub of hot water, all 17 of us would take a 
bath. And regardless how dirty the water 
is, you still can wash in it. We cooked on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
32
 
 
 
open fire. We frequently would get a loaf of
 bread from a farmer here and there. We 
would get a bottle of milk. Mostly we liv
ed on bread and milk. We would get a good, 
cooked meal in somebody™s farmhouse, maybe once or twice a week. We carried the 
dry bread in our backpacks. That™s what  I carried in my  backpack, probably two 

pounds of dry bread. 

Q: At the farmhouse they would feed 17 of you? 

A: They would feed 17 of us. Matter of
 fact, many times when we came to a 

farmhouse -- when we wanted to visit the fa
rmhouse, the farmer will kill a pig and we 
would pig out.  

Q: Would you pay them or were they 
offering this as a manner of support? 
A: In most cases -- in all cases, they 
would not accept payment. Sometime we paid. 
Matter of fact, after we highjacked a Germ
an bank, we spread money all over the 
countryside. And to some degree, that 
was our undoing. We had to move into a 
different territory. 

Q: You left a trail. 

A: We left a trail. The German -- the Germans were wondering where tho-those marks 

are coming from that these people have in this neighborhood? 

Q: You talked about at one point you -- 
you got a break from your fighting unit and 
you went somewhere to study psychological 
warfare, or you -- could you tell us mo re 
about that? What -- where did you 
go and what were you learning? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
33
 
 
 
A: In a -- there was a course given for Akar
 and also Enerzet in Warsaw, in apraga 
district. It took about six -- six weeks, four
 days a week. There were professors from 
Polish -- Warsaw University. There were
 some propagandas from Polish underground. 
There was one British man who spoke Po
lish and nobody could unde
rstand him. And 
they talked a lot. It was mainly give
n for people who were employ -- I mean, who 
were publishing Polish underground 
papers. But they also took some of us -- some of 
the commanders of small groups in the count
ryside to go through this, so we would 
know -- be mo re conversant what was really 
going on in Poland -- in the world -- in a -
- in a war in the west, in a war on the easte
rn front. And how to act against Germans of 
this kind and that kind. How to browbeat them, if you could -- 
Q: There -- they actually had like a da
y where you talked about browbeating? 
A: Browbeating them. How to be --  

Q: How would you browbeat someone? 

A: -- how to be ornery to them and still don™t get shot. 

Q: Do you rememb er any of the advice they gave you in that? 

A: Well, they gave us advices. You talk to
 a German and he runs the Poles and you tell 
him, ﬁWhy do you run the Poles down? My gr
andfather was a German general and I 

am Polish now and a lot of us are de-des
cendants of a German people. So you watch 
out. A lot of Poles are just like you Germans,
 sometime even better.ﬂ So some of them 
would accept it. Some of them would rail against you, some of them wou -- might 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
34
 
 
 
even hit you, but in mo st cases they woul
d listen and said, ﬁUh-huh, yavolt, yavolt, 
yavolt.ﬂ 
Q: And apparently you learned something about forgery during this time? 

A: Yes, I learned how to wash and how to make documents. 

Q: How to what? 

A: Wash the documents. 

Q: Wash the documents. 

A: Wash the documents. And how to remake them. 

Q: How -- how -- how do y -- can you tell us about that? 

A: You use chemicals to -- to get off -- especially if you write something and -- mo st 

of the documents made there were not typed,  but were written in ink. And there was a 

chemical, you can wash the ink out nicely 
and you can dry it and use another chemical 
to neutralize it and then you can write agai
n. Somebody™s else names, somebody™s else 
data. And I do that after the war in Germany, for people who are escaping from 

Poland, who could not get admitte
d to the displaced person camp. 
Q: You helped make documents 
so they could get admitted? 
A: So they could get admitted into displ
aced person camps, so they would not be 

vagabonds, staying in -- I mean -- fa -- I 
mean trying and stea
ling and robbing and 
doing things for themselves and getting, eventu
ally, caught -- arrested and sent to jail. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
35
 
 
 
Q: You -- you said at one point in the prev ious interview, that when you got to the 
camps, that you could almo st describe that
 experience as mild, comp ared to your 
experience in the underground, in terms of
 the danger and the intensity that you 
experienced. 

A: Yes, the experience getting into th
e first camp, the Gross-Rosen camp -- 
Q: That™s not what I™m asking, I™m asking -- what I™m -- I™m saying is that -- you said 

the camps were almo st easy after being 
in the underground, that the underground was 
so dangerous and hard. And I™m just wonde
ring if -- if you couldn™t say a little more 

about that. 

A: Yes, it were -- in a camp you were not -- before you got to know what was really 

going on, you felt almo st a relief, because my
 interrogation after arrest, was very 

intensive. I was badly mistreated. My last
 few weeks in Polish underground were very 

intense [indecipherable] very dangerous. 
So, first coming to the camp  and getting 
shaved and getting washed and given a 
uniform and being little chased around, 
occasionally hit, but not badly, did not 
feel too bad. Eventually, you learned how 
horrible it was, but it was later -- later on. 
The first impression was, was not exactly 
summer camp and a bet -- but better than pris
on, because you did not
 sleep, 17 of you, 
in a two person cell, as I did in a prison 
before, during my  interrogation and after my  

sentence. So, first it was almo st a relief that you were in a place where you could 

almo st survive. Later on you learned otherwise. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
36
 
 
 
Q: What was so intense and difficult a
bout the last few weeks of your underground 
time? 
A: We were very active. We did get into
 several firefights. We blew up few objects 
that mis-blew, either blew in our direction 
or else were mishandled. I was called on the 
carpet couple of times and threatened with
 execution, because you messed up the job. 
Comb ination of all of it can get you down,
 occasionally. Even the -- I was not as 
rambunctious as I always wa
s, during last few weeks. 
Q: Was that a real possibility? Did you fe
el that your commanders might execute you 
if you did something that they really -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- felt was wrong? 

A: Yes, executions happened. I don™t -- I di
dn™t think he would, but executions did 
happen, not only for treason.  

Q: Simply for not executing an
 -- a job correctly sometimes? 
A: Yes, yes.  

Q: Did you think that was a fair method of treatment? 

A: No, I didn™t think it was fair, but I thought was -- it was effective. Fairness -- 

fairness has nothing to do with it, effectiveness did. 

Q: You said that sometimes after you would 
do an action that everyone™s nerves were 
very jangled and you needed to just go into 
the forest and be quiet for a day or two.

What would you do? Where would you go a
nd what would you do as a group to calm 
down after a very intense action? 
A: Some people would be allowed to go and 
visit with friends and relatives. In most 

cases we just stayed at the group. We were
 so tightly knit. We would tell jokes, we 
would get drunk. We would sleep a lot. If we
 had food, we would eat a lot, would pig 
out comp letely. Then we would drink again 
and after about a week or so, was good as 

new. 

Q: Would you ever sing? 

A: Of course, oh, we sang a lot. We sang a 
lot. Polish patriotic song, bawdy songs, just 
about anything. We even sang Lily Mar -- 
Lily Marlin. We even sang Soviet songs. 
We would sing the Internationale. 

Q: And would you -- 

A: You know, the Internationale has a very
 rousing melody and a -- and great words. 
Q: Can you tell us some of the names th
at you rememb er of these people that you 
fought with? 

A: I knew their pseudo-names. I did not -- 
well, I knew probably one or two or three 
people who were from my  neighborhood. I knew th
eir first and last names, but in mo st 
cases, I would simp ly forget them. We would have our names -- occasionally the 

names were changed and you would talk to
 one of them and said, ﬁWhat was your 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
38
 
 
 
name again?ﬂ So he would tell you. ﬁThat 
was your -- your name last week, what™s 
your name now?ﬂ 
Q: When you went to relax, did you ever  meet other underground groups and were 

there ever women in any of the other groups, or in your group? 

A: Not in our neighborhood, there were no women. We very seldom met other 

underground groups. Sometime we met with other underground groups to -- to -- to 

make comparisons, to get information, to 
tell how to do things. How we do it, how we 
-- do you do it? Can we be mo re -- may we be
 mo re effective if we do it your way? 
May you be mo re effective if you do -- do it 
our way? What are the similarity of 
objects that we attack? What are the differe
nces? How to approach them better? You 
know, 40 minds are better than 20 minds. We
 would argue, we would tell them, ﬁYou 
don™t know a thing. You do it my way, you will survive.ﬂ He would tell -- they would 

tell you, ﬁYou don™t know a thing, you do it our 
way. You lost two people, we didn™t 
lose anybody.ﬂ ﬁWell, of course you di
dn™t lose anybody, because you didn™t do 
anything.ﬂ It was a constant bickering. Some
 of it was serious, some of -- most of it 
was just jokingly doing things
 to relieve the tension. 
Q: And would this be a group that was pa
rt of the NSZ, the same as your overall 
group, or just any other? 

A: It would be, most of the time, the NS
Z people. We would occasionally meet with 
the Akar people, but only formally and so
metime to exchange information. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
39
 
 
 
would frequently tell us -- tell us about certai n objects that were too difficult for them. 
Sometime we would tell them about certain 
object were too large for us. They had 

larger groups -- they could form larger groups quickly, because they were mo re 

numerous in this particular neighborhood, 
so they could form -- occasionally -- 
occasionally, but very seldom, we would ha
ve a combined operation. But we never 
really thought much of it, because our ta
ctics were different from their tactics. 
Q: How were your tactics different? 

A: Our tactics frequently were just a direct attack. Their tactics was go from behind 

and hit and run. Our tactics were mo stly, 
go out, hit and fight. Because if you hit and 
run, you may wound somebody, you may scar
e somebody. If you attack and fight, 

well, you probably will get few. Matter of fa
ct, sometime you get quite a few. So that 

was our tactics, constantly and my  commande
r Be Dom alway said, ﬁHit fast, hit hard 

and if you have to run, run. But if you 
don™t have to run, you better not. Stay and 
fight.ﬂ  

Q: Where were you at the time that the 
government in exile called for the -- the 
Warsaw uprising by the underground? 

A: I was in a concentration camp , yes, by that time. It was in summer of 1944. It was 

my  one, two, three -- it was my  fourth month.
 I was much affect -- I was in Vienna at 
that time, in a sub-camp of Mauthausen, in
 Vienna, working in a Ostermunzowerverk, 
building Tiger tanks.

Q: Can you tell us about a friend you had, he
r -- her name was Nellie and apparently 
she was a courier? 
A: Yes. She was a courier for the Akar 
and she was lucky. She spent four years 
carrying stuff. Propaganda, explosives
, ammunition. And she made it. 

Q: How did you know her? 

A: I met Nellie when she was about seven and I was 10. She came as a beautiful, 

young, city girl to have a vacation in a sm
all, small village. And I was the peasant boy 
who met a beautiful princess. And we stayed
 friends ever after. She would come every 
year for about month and a half, two m
onths. We would talk, we would go skinny-
dipping. She would ride my  horses and I w
ould listen to her mu sic. She played good 
violin. When she was about eight, she pl
ayed very good violin. And she spent her 
lifetime being a musician. 

Q: What part of the underground was she attached to? 

A: She was attached to the A-Akar -- to the home army. 

Q: And can you tell us about seeing her onc
e you were back in Poland as now a -- a 
resistance fighter? When you were back, how 
did you see her again, or hear of her? 
A: Yeah, we met, we met. She was still coming for a vacation. She went -- she was 

still in grade school. She -- as a matter of fact, she was just finishing grade school and 

she immediately became a courier. Even when
 she was in school, she was a courier on 
a small scale. Then she was going to unde
rground middle school and we would meet 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
41
 
 
 
in Warsaw when I was there, occasionally. 
She would occasionally come to our village 
and we were it. We thought we would never forget one another when we grown up 
and the war ends, we™ll surely marry. 
We knew how many children we™re going to 
have and everything else. And I really shoul
d write to her presently, I know where she 
is. She married after the war, they had one s
on. Tragically, he died in his mid 30™s. 
And both she and her husband played in a 
symphony orchestra all their lives. They 
retired just recently. Their son was a mu
sician, too. He played in a symphony 
orchestra. And at -- I heard -- I have it s
econd or third hand from my  first cousin, who 
started corresponding with her after I men
tioned her once in a letter. And I should 
really write to her and -- but, you know, it was so many times, so many years. We live 

our own lives. Hate to open the old wounds. 
But I really ought to write her. She was a 
beautiful girl and a beautiful person. She had the greatest hair you ever saw. She had 

an enormous amount of hair. When she [i ndecipherable] she could sit on her hair. 

Q: What color? 

A: Dark brown. 

Q: What did you say to her when you found 
out that she was carrying documents for 
the underground? What was your reaction? 

A: Well, I said, ﬁMore power to you, but be
 darn careful.ﬂ And, we talked about 
things. And I had misgivings. I had misg
ivings about my work, getting so many 
bystanders and so many people who are not 
real Nazis, killed, mutilated. And we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
42
 
 
 
talked about it and she wrote me, saying th
at, ﬁDon™t feel guilty, because I don™t.ﬂ She 
said, ﬁI carry stuff that blows up people and I don™t feel guilty.ﬂ  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: How did you eventually come to terms with
 that, or make peace with that part of 
what you did? 
A: For a long time, I did not. I had many, 
many sleepless nights. My conscience was 
really upset that so many people who did not 
have to die, did. So many people who did 
not have to be mutilated, did. Both on 
my side, on the -- on the other side. But 
eventually, time heals. And I 
still feel somewhat guilty. I have twinges of conscience. 

But I talked to people, I talked to a Cat
holic priest, even con -- in a concentration 
camps and I had misgivings about it and he sa
id, ﬁYou should just simp ly forget it. It 
was a necessity.ﬂ Oh, by the way, Nellie marri
ed a Jew. Nellie married a Jewish man -- 
Polish Jewish man who survived a concentr
ation camp , and lived happily ever after. 
Q: Did your faith in God play a part in 
you sort of making peace in yourself with -- 
with these things that were bothering you? 

A: Greatly. Mostly. Also, I have known many pe
ople, in Siberian camp , in the German 
death camp, even religious people who lost th
eir faith, say, ﬁIf God existed, nothing as 
horrible as this could happen.ﬂ I had no pr
oblem, I never lost my  faith. I don™t think 
it™s my virtue, it™s a grace. Never had any mi
sgivings about the existence of God, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
43
 
 
 
His/Her direction of us. Recently I 
had a -- ordered for somebody a book called a 
Lectionary, you know, gospels read during th
e mass? It was a Methodist Lectionary 
and the gospels, they made it into inclusiv e language and whenever it says God, it -- 

personal pronoun, it always says, He/She, He/She
, He/She. It made me sick to read it. 
It™s awful, it comp letely disfigures it. We
 don™t know what God is. He may -- He is not 
He, He is not She, so He is -- I mean He -- 
It™s a God. But to put something like this in 
the Gospel, it™s just outrageous, especially th e first -- the first paragraph in the gospel 

of John, with about 11 personal 
pronouns. I™m sorry, I™m diverting. 
Q: That™s funny. Did you ever do an action with Nellie? 

A: No, never did. She did not go in action. 
She carried stuff. And in most cases, that 
was mo re dangerous than being in ac tion. Carrying a suitcase of dynamite, you 

endanger not yourself, but everybody in that  comp artment. They found it, everybody 

on spot would be executed. Oh, she -- many 
times when the train was crowded, she 
would bring -- pack her two suitcases and go into a German comp artment and she 

would make the apologies, ﬁI™m sorry, I -- th
e -- so tired and so hot and so crowded 
there, could I just sit on the floor here?ﬂ Th
ey say, ﬁOh no, floor, come on, sit -- sit on 
the [indecipherable]ﬂ They would sit her 
on the seat, they would give her so -- 
chocolate, they would give her some coffee 
to drink. They put her suitcases up in the 
rack and she would say, ﬁWatch out, wa
tch out, there™s some eggs in there.ﬂ

Q: I™m sure you were in situations like that
 too, where you were right looking, staring 
into the face of someone who, if they discovered you -- 
A: Well, of course. 

Q: -- you would be in big trouble. 

A: Well, of course. Zillion of times. Sorry, 
I have to wipe my eyes now and then. 
Q: That™s all right. 

A: My glaucoma makes my eyes -- eyes 
run and I have to live with from now on. 
Nothing to it, actually. I can see, I can r
ead. And my  doctor said, ﬁI™m going to keep 
you -- I™ll keep you seeing until the day you die.ﬂ 

Q: That™s important, because you love to read. 

A: Oh, I love to read. I read about 10 hours a day. 

Q: Go to the library and you get the books -- 

A: Oh, of course. 

Q: -- every week. 

A: I work in a bookstore. 

Q: I know, I know. 

A: You will see my bookstore 
[indecipherable] go downtown. 
Q: Yeah, I want to see it, I do want to see 
it. You had an uncle who apparently, in an 
argument over food with a Communist, was mu rdered? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
45
 
 
 
Q: I™m wondering if you could tell us that story? 
A: Yes, my Uncle Brunusnous was a soldtis, 
which was a head of a village. It was a 
elected office -- non-paying elected office,
 but if you got elected, you became a 

prominente -- you become a prominent person. And he had -- he was in the Akar and 

he went with me on a few works -- he we
nt with me on a few jobs. Also another 
person -- a cousin of mine -- first cousin 
-- his nephew and my  first cousin went on a 
work with me. He had an encounter with 
a Communist. They didn™t appreciate what 
he was doing. And at one time the Communi
st group went on a robbery spee -- spree. 
And he investigated them. He did not report 
them to the German authorities, but they 
didn™t like it, so they came and shot and kille
d him. My father kind of tried to defend 
him, so they beat hi -- my  father was badly, badly beaten. 

Q: Your father was there when this happened? 

A: My father was approached then and trie
d to defend him. And there was -- they are 
pushing one another and then one
 of them shot him twice. They killed a-another of my 
relatives in a -- a second end of a village, 
who had two sons who were fighting against 
the Communist underground, they killed him. And -- 

Q: This -- the uncle who was killed wa
s killed in your village, Leshganorra? 
A: Yes, in Leshnagorra. 

Q: Leshnagorra. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
46
 
 
 
Q: Do you know about when this happened? 
A: That was in -- in 1943 -- in fall of 1943. 

Q: And this was your father™s brother? 

A: My father™s brother. They live in the same
 house. One part was his, one part of my  
father™s. 

Q: So this was someone you knew very well? 

A: Yes. And of course, before he was killed,
 he took one of the -- arm of one of them, 
with a hatchet. When he out -- went out 
at night, he always had a hatchet under his 
belt. He had a big overcoat on 
and he knew that -- just before they shot him, he 
whipped the ha-hatchet and took ar
m off one of those attackers. 
Q: So these Communists are Polish Communists? 

A: Polish Communists. 

Q: And -- and they™re underground at this point, too? 

A: They were in the underground at point, too. 

Q: So what was the reaction of your father and of you? 

A: Well, those three people who killed my unc
le did not survive more than about two 

months. They were killed, one by one, by my
 cousin, the son of the -- of my close 
relative who also was killed. That young man was a poacher. He could tra -- track -- 

trace any animal to any place, any time. He
 was hunting birds with that 22, because 
shotgun was too expensive to us
e. So, one by one he traced them to place where they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
47
 
 
 
were, he shot them, he brought the bodies to
 the German authorities, say, ﬁHere, one 
more.ﬂ Then a third one was very difficult.
 H-He shot the first two -- the Germans 
provided him with a rifle, because he went 
and he said, ﬁMy father was killed, I know 
who those people were. Those were the pe
ople who are robbing and killing and raping 
this neighborhood. Give me a gun, I™ll dispos
e of them.ﬂ So they gave him manual 
rifle, one shot rifle. He killed the first one
 within next -- first two weeks, the one who 
had arm -- well, he was atta -- I mean, it wa
s comp  -- not comp letely detached, but he 
were -- had it bandaged. He killed a second 
one -- a second one next month and a third 
one he had a hard time getting. So he went
 on a mission. He ate and slept in a hedge 
nearby where this person™s wife lived. It wa
s middle of a winter. He froze, he was hot, 
he was cold, he was hungry. Eventually he ca me to visit his wife. So, he got out and 

shot him, put him on the sled, brought his body to the authorities.  

Q: So, in that specific incident, there 
was some cooperation with the Germans? 
A: Yes. It was the Polish blue police and there was one German policeman who was 

with the Polish police. It was a cooperati
on with a -- kind of a anti-crime cooperation 
with the Germans.  

Q: What was this cousin™s name? 

A: His name was Marion Borudes and he deve
loped bad habit. He was very poor man, 
he had a beautiful, young wife and a little 
boy. He went robbing Jewish people who 
were in hiding. And the two boys from th
e Polish underground came in one day and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
48
 
 
 
shot him dead. Matter of fact, he was co
ming from a county village to the -- to our 
village. He entered our village. There we
re two boys on bicycles, said, ﬁMarion?ﬂ 
ﬁYes, I am Marion.ﬂ ﬁMarion Borudes?ﬂ ﬁYes
, I am Marion  Borudes.ﬂ They whipped 
out pistols and shot him to pieces. They 
shot him about 17 times. They got in the 
bicycles -- they took his boots off, he had 
a beautiful cavalry boots and they took his 
boots off and ran. And two of his olde
r brothers ran out with rifles and 

[indecipherable] village, they were like maybe
 five -- half a kilometer -- close to one 
kilometer away and they got 
in the France and they were 
shooting in them. So they 
dropped the boots and ran away. They didn™t get hit. 

Q: How do you know they shot him for the st
ealing from the Jews in hiding? How was 
that made clear? 

A: It was an execution -- underground court has a execution -- were notif -- people 

were notified. Matter of fact, there was a doc
ument left on him for the -- they read hi -- 
they read him the sentence.  

Q: Well, I think I have covered what I wanted to cover about your time in the 

Resistance and I™m probably going to move
 on to the post war ins -- I thought we 
could maybe take a break now. 

A: Okay, let™s take a break. 

Q: An-And just -- but does it seem like we covered the -- 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
49
 
 
 
Q: One last question about the traini
ng you received to become an underground 
fighter, and this is when you were still 
in Iran and it -- can you tell us about your 
farewell party? 

A: Yes, at the end of our training, just befo
re we were sent on a trip back, a local -- I 
don™t know if he was a nomad, but I know he ha
d a beautiful tent in the desert, nearby 
our -- our camp. He apparently was a pe
rson of consequence, because he had a 
beautiful tent, he had several wives and a lo
t of children and he had a party for us. And 
for some reason or another -- I think because I was the smallest one -- so he gave me 

the biggest two pillows to sit on and I must
 have become some kind of a prominent 

person in his estimation, because his beau 
-- most beautiful wife was serving me and 
she sa -- even sat next to me couple of times
. And then, when the main course came, or 
the mo st important course came, which wa
s sheep eyes, it was a big dish of sheep 

eyes, he handed them to me and he said
, ﬁYou eat as many of those as you can.ﬂ 
Because that was an so-called honor dish. So
 I said, ﬁWell, I thank you very much for 
your recognition, but I would like to share it w
ith all of you, so you are the first one to 
share with me.ﬂ So he took one and ev
 -- I sent it around and everybody took one. By 
the time it came back to me, there was only one
 eye left. So I put it in and I swallowed 

it, almost choked on it. And, you cannot chew
 a sheep™s eye, just
 like a little billiard 
ball. You swallow it And I did choke at the e
nd, of course. Then, there was a cumis to 
drink. And cumis is an Arabian and Persian 
drink that is made of 100 percent alcohol 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
50
 
 
 
and mir -- milk. They put it in a leather bag,
 a man gets on a horse and he rides out of 
a des -- in a desert -- in heat, whatever. And he rides a long distance there and a long 
distance back and that thing gets way -- we
ll shaken -- well mixed. Then they cool it 
off and you drink it. And is the smoothest 
drink you have ever drunk. And if yo -- and 

it™s -- it goes in so neatly, but man, the 
katzenjammer you get. That was the worst 
hangover I ever had. After I drank the drink, 
I almo st dropped. I sat for the rest of the 
party, I didn™t know where I was. I was sick all night. I was mo  -- sick mo st of the next 

mo rning and I forswore alcohol forever and a 
day. Well, of course, I didn™t drink for at 
least four weeks after that. That was the greatest party I ever went to and I don™t 

remember much of it after the first drink. 

Q: Okay, I™d like to move into the post wa
r period. Initially, you are -- recuperate in a 
sanitorium and then, can you tell us about 
when you™re first taken to Wildeflecken? 
A: Wildeflecken, yes. To quickly go through 
it, from Gusensfite, those of us who were 
half dead, were immediately transported to
 Hokenfelds, which was in West Germany. 

It was in early May, shortly after liberation.  They stabilized us, we did get a little milk 

mixed with water and a gruel, kind of like a baby food, for some time. So I was in the 

field hospital in Hokenfelds for a short tim
e, then I was transported to Statishere 
Hospital in Bamburg, West Germany, Bavari
a. It was in June and I was there until 
October, 1945, with a bad case with tubercul
osis and a bad case of starvation. By 
October -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
51
 
 
 
Q: At this point, when you™re in the hosp
ital for these various months, from June to 
October, what are you eating at this point? 
A: We were -- received very light hospital food, mostly soups. Very little bread, very, 

very little meat. If there was a meat, it was a kind of almost like it was pre-digested. 

By October I could sit, I could even walk. 
I could even walk to the bathroom all by 
myself. I could go hide in a bathroom, lo
ck my door and smoke. And sister will -- 
soon I would come and bang on the door and sa
y, ﬁStefan, doshturb. Steve -- Stefan, 
you are going to die. Don™t smoke. Nicht ro
wken. You are not supposed to smoke.ﬂ 
And I think I owe her my life, because sh
e made me stop smoking and I never smoked 
since. Anyway -- 

Q: And this was -- 

A: It was in a state hospital. 

Q: Her -- her name was? 

A: Sister Ursula. She is in my -- 

Q: Sister Ursula? 

A: Ursula. She is in my previous -- in my 
previous interview. I even spell her name on 
the form later on. Then I was sent to TB 
Sanitorium in Foreheim, which is also in 
Bavaria. I was there from Novemb er ‚45, to
 April, 1946, eating mo stly dairy food. A 
lot of butter, lot of cream, lot of milk
 and white -- white bread. My stomach 
recuperated completely. Actually, before I le
ft -- before I left Bamburg Hospital, my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
52
 
 
 
lungs -- the liquid collecting in my  lungs 
was pumped out of me and my  stomach was 
also pumped out. Don™t ever let your stomac h be pumped out, that™s the mo st horrible 

feeling you ever had. From Foreh-Foreheim 
Sanitorium, which, when it was liquidated 
in April of 1945, we were transported to Loh
r, L-o-h-r, also in Bavaria. I was there for 
sh -- very short time in July, 1945 -- I™m 
sorry, 1946. Then, I comp letely recovered 
and was transferred to displaced person camp 
in Ashafenberg. It was Eyager Casernin, 
former German army camp, close to the city
. I work part time as a kitchen help, part, 
later on, as a accountant in kitchen acc
ounting department. And then I becames a 

glorified long distance runner, between thr
ee local camp s, delivering messages from 
the camp authorities. 

Q: Literally running? 

A: Well, a bicycle -- bicycle, on foot. Later 
on, I traveled to ash -- to Swineferd on a 

mo torcycle. I had the best American mo torb
ike you ever had, it was Harley Davidson, 
1941. Biggest ever, 407 -- 750 cc™s, at that 
time it was the biggest. Now, the biggest 
one is about three times as powerful. So, 
I was in Ashafenberg  DP camp , from 1946, 
July, to sometime in 1947, or early 1948. In
 1948, the camp was liquidated. The camp  
was liquidated and you were sent to Wildef
lecken. It was an e-enormous Polish DP 
camp. It was also an army  camp  previ
ously, where SS mountain troops were being 
trained. There were a lot of skis, so we di
d a lot of skiing. I ran out in many trees going 
down the hill. That time I worked as a 
-- beginning as a stenographer and for the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
53
 
 
 
duration, I worked as a detective in crime 
bureau and also part time, I worked with a 
American army  CIC with Captain Vulcanovsky. 
Q: Okay, good. I think that™s a important su
mmary and then there are a few places I™d 
like to revisit and s-spend a little more time on. 

A: All right. 

Q: If you can think back to the displaced pe
rson™s camp  that -- the one -- the second to 
the last, where you were at from 1946 to ‚48. 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, it is -- so it was in Ashafenberg, the Yagercaserra -- Yaggercaservna. Like -- 

Q: Tell us what -- what that was like? Wh
at did it physically look like, and when you 
were brought in, where were you settled? 

A: It was an army camp. There were brick 
buildings, three, four 
and five story high. 
The rooms were small and each room would have
 a family or several single  people. In 
my room, there were two families. Ther
e was a husband and wife. There was a lady 
with a child and I was the fifth person. We 
had bunk beds. We slept, we ate there. The 
food was given in a camp kitchen. You we
nt with a container and he brou -- you 
brought your tea in the mo rning with a slice of bread and some margarine. You 

received a soup at noon and you received a s
oup at night, also with some tea. Many 
people would be given some non -- unpaid se
rvice jobs. Matter of fact, everybody had

to do some work on maybe half a day a week
 or a day every two weeks, to clean, to 
sweep, to dig, to shovel, to do whatever. 
Some people were employed full times; those 
who worked in a kitchen, those who worked 
in a public works, those who served as a 
camp police.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Stefan Czyzewski. This is tape num
ber three, side A. B-Before we go a little 
further with that, it occurred to me, were you 
surprised that you were able to recover? I 

mean, your body, when you were in the sanitori
ums or in the different hospitals, were 
you worried that maybe you weren™t going to -- 

A: Yes, I was. 

Q: -- get your strength back? 

A: Yes, I was. I was so debilitated, I di
dn™t think I would ever surprise -- ev-ever 
survive. When I did and became well, I was 
just flabbergasted. First of all, it was 

freedom and second of all, I was healthy. I 
was very healthy. I 
could run, I could do 
things. I could climb. I could just about 
-- li-like my  previous time. I mean, my  young 
age. I was small. Big kids beat on me. I 
could always hit some
body and run fast and 
nobody ever could catch up with me. And the 
thing -- and this condition came back 
after I recuperated -- after I got out of the sanitorium. 

Q: Did you notice some things that didn™t come back? You didn™t quite get your full 

strength back? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
56
 
 
 
A: Not really. I did not. I not. My hair grew up. My -- I had my  teeth repaired; some of 
them were knocked out. And matter of fact, I 
still have one bridge -- stationary bridge 
of steel teeth, that was made by the German doctor in 1947. I still have it.  

Q: What had happened to your hair? 

A: Well, our hairs were shaved, or clipped.
 And in the middle of a he -- from the front 
to the back, there was a inch and a half stri
p that™s all shaved every week and they -- 
we used to call it Adolf Hitlerstrasser. If you escaped from a camp, people could 

recognize it, you were an inmate. 

Q: When you were recovering, were ther
e foods that you really wanted, but you 
weren™t able to have? 

A: Yes, there was a lot of food that you re
ally would have wanted, but you ate what 
you were given. The food was scarce at that
 time and hospital food was kind of awful, 
but it was nourishing. Sanitorium food was ju
st great. There was a good, white bread. 
There was a lot of butter and a lot and lot 
of milk and even little meat. And also, we 
did get Red Cross packages. Each person r
eceived one every two or three weeks, 
which were greatly helpful. There was so
me little American sausages, little wieners 
that were the most -- I can close my eyes 
and I can taste them, how great they were. 
And there was a chunk of chocolate. And I al
ways was crazy for chocolate. I think I 
mentioned a previous interview that one 
time the packages came and the chocolate 

was mo ldy. So I traded with everybody and 
I did get probably five, six, maybe even 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
57
 
 
 
10 big chunks of chocolate, pr
obably four or five ounces each and I ate myself sick. 
And I couldn™t look in a -- chocolate in the 
face for next two months at least. But I 
went back to it. 
Q: Do you still like chocolate? 

A: I™m still -- I still like chocolate very much. 

Q: I™ve heard a lot about these packages, par
ticularly everyone mentions the chocolate. 
A: Well, of course. We were starved for 
chocolate. Chocolate was not available in 
Europe -- Europe that whole war time. Five
, six, seven years. The Germans would sell 
their soul for a piece of chocolate. A la
dy would sell her daughter, I mean, a husband 
would se -- would sell his wife for -- for a package of American cigarettes, or a chunk 

of chocolate. 

Q: And when exactly did you quit smoking? 

A: In 1945, in summer, in Bamb erg shtateecha 
hospital. And Sister Ursula was it. She 
was an old German nun -- nun, and she was ve
ry persistent and she watched me like a 
hawk. She made me smo -- stop smoking.  

Q: So it really was because she was hounding you about this? 

A: Yeah, she was hounding me. She -- she wi -- told me, ﬁYou will die if you smoke. 

Your lungs are so bad. You are full of 
liquid, you cannot breathe and you smoke? You 
a stupid kid. Du fareek da kind.ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
58
 
 
 
Q: When you were in the sanitorium and th
en the Di-Displaced Persons camp , how -- 
what was your attitude towards food? Did you 
trust that food would be there or did 
you find yourself wanting to take it back to your room for instance? 
A: In some -- some camps, you could take it to your room. You went and the -- in -- in 

Wildeflecken, there were -- there were eati
ng halls that you went and ate, especially 
for the people who worked. Starting in Asha
fenberg, later in Wildeflecken, I always 
had a job. So those of us who worked ha
d a special dining room. The food was not diff 
-- any different from the rest of the people™
s food, but the room was nicer and we ate 

there. There even occasionally was a 
dessert. And I had two friends, Captain 
Psheckfass and Lieutenant Penjik. And 
whenever came to a dessert, Captain 

Psheckfass started talking about those ho
rrible bodies being carried out of a gas 

chamber, to the crematorium, to the cooler
 room and so on and so forth. And Mr. 

Penjik, who™d said, ﬁDisgusting.ﬂ He would 
toss his fork and walk away and Mr. -- 
and Captain Penjik, who™d ate Mr. -- Capt
ain Psheckfass would eat Mr. Penjik™s 
dessert. Never failed, it always worked.  

Q: And you were sitting there laughing? 

A: And I was sitting, eating my own and 
laughing. Sometime before Mr. Psheckfass -- 
Captain Psheckfass grabbed Mr. Penjik
™s dessert, I grabbed it first.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
59
 
 
 
Q: What were dinner conversations like a-at
 that table? What were you talking about? 
What were people talking about when 
they weren™t working at the camp  
[indecipherable] 
A: Well, they were -- they were worrying a
bout their relatives -- friends and relatives 
back in Poland. They were worrying what th
ey are going to do. They were worrying if 
they were maybe -- if they may be forced 
to repatriate back to Communist Poland. 
They were discussing possibilities of emigrati
on. At that time, all in 1945, six, even 
seven, nobody dreamed that he -- they would 
be able to go to America. America was 
kind of a seventh heaven somewhere way 
up there. Nobody thought they would ever 

be able to reach it. So, many people started 
emigrating in 1948, to Belgium, to work in 

the coal mines. To Great Britain to work in
 the coal mines. Later on, when emigration 
became available to Canada, many people 
-- many, many people went to Canada. 
Then eventually, U.S. legislation passed a 
special bill that allo
wed the refugees from 
Displaced Person camp to come here outside 
of the quota. They still ha-had kind of a 
quota and people from certain countries had ea
sier time coming here than from others. 
And the Polish people especially, were give
n certain preference. So, a lot of Polish 
Jewish people were coming to America and 
a lot of Poles were coming to America. 
And a lot of Russian, Ukrainian and White
 Russian people, falsify a doc -- their 
documents as if they were Polish citizens, a
nd also came in here. So the conversations, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
60
 
 
 
a lot of it was, ﬁCan I go to America? Can 
I go to Australia? Oh, can I go to Canada?ﬂ 
But everybody wanted to come to the 
seventh heaven, which was America. 
Q: Were you -- who else was in the camp?
 The way you just described it, it sounds 
like there were other Poles? But who -- who made up the camp  population? 
A: The Ashafenberg camp was a mixture of
 White Russians, few Russians, some 
Ukrainians and Poles, but Poles constituted 
about 90 percent of the population in -- in 

our Ashafenberg camp. The other two ca
mps in Ashafenberg, Displaced Person 
camps, one was strictly Ukrainian and one
 was strictly Russian and -- and White 
Russian.  

Q: So, is that why you were sent there? To Ashafenberg? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Okay. Mm-hm. 

A: Wildeflecken was strictly a Polish camp
. There were some Latvians and Estonians 
and a few, very few White Russians. But 
there were no Ukrainians and no Russian 
Russians. Probably Poles were there 90 
-- probably 98 percent Polish people.  

Q: Now, when you were in Ashafenberg, it wa
s ‚46, ‚47, until early ‚48. This is a 
pretty long time after the war has ended. 
How -- what were people™s feelings about 
that; that they had been li-living in 
Displaced Person™s camps for so long? 
A: Well, they didn™t have chance to get 
jobs in Germany. There was hunger, privation 
and no jobs to be had. Also, we were not allowed to apply for civilian jobs. So they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
61
 
 
 
were kind of kept caged. If you wanted to
 go out, you had to have a permission -- 
written permission to go out, with a hope of 
emigrating somewhere. Some Russian and 
some White Russian people were forced to re
patriate to their respective countries. And 
of course, we heard later on that all of them we
re dr -- went directly to si -- to Siberia. 

And Polish people, Czech people, Hungarian
 and Romanians and the Baltic countries, 
people were not forced to repatriate, so th
ey just waited. Sit -- sat, vegetated in 
Germany. Developed bad habits like not 
working, or drinking and waiting for the 
heaven to open somewhere. And 
eventually, most of us emigra
ted. Most of us came to 
United States, a lot went to Canada and Aust
ralia. Some to Great Britain, some to the 
low countries to get the mo st menial jobs
 that nobody else wanted to take. I had a 

friend who was a black market operator in W
ildeflecken camp  and when his half a day 
a week assignment came, he never showed 
up. Or else he would pay somebody to go 
and do his shoveling or splitting the wood. 
Eventually, he was called to a camp 

administrator who was -- who was American -- who was American lady. And he was 

questioned and said mer -- she said, ﬁMr. So
 and so, I heard that you have not gone 
last week and this week to -- to your a ssigned work. What is the matter with you?ﬂ 

And he said, ﬁLady, that™s a lie. They are 
schmearing me. I have never went to wor -- 
begun to work. I have never yet did any work
. I pay people to work for me.ﬂ ﬁWell, 
how can you afford it?ﬂ ﬁWell, see, I™m great black market operator. And I™m lucky 

because I never get caught.ﬂ So that wa -- 
she laughed and she let him go. By the way, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
62
 
 
 
the administrator of Wildef
lecken camp was Miss Catherine Hulme, H-u-l-m-e. And 
there is a beautiful book written by her about 
the Wildeflecken camp. It was called, 
ﬁThe Wild Place.ﬂ It was published in 1950™s 
and I had had a copy and I loaned it to 
somebody, never got it back. Has been out
 of print since about 1960™s and I can 
presume that the mu seum might have a copy.
 If they don™t, they should really search 

for it and find it. She was a good writer, especially when she wrote about Mrs. 

Captain. There was a tough underground ca
ptain, lady from Polish underground army , 
who ran a block -- a barrack -- probably c
ouple hundred former prostitutes. She put 
them all on a -- on a s-straight and narrow.
 None of them ever did any trade in 
Wildeflecken when -- when th
e Mrs. Captain was there. She was just like a god, like a 
block as -- altester in a concentration ca
mp . Watch out, don™t cross Mrs. Captain. She 
was an old lady, she was big, she was bowle
gged. She -- when they had a parade, she 
would walk ahead of her troops. She was a -- 

Q: Her troops of former prostitutes? 

A: No, sh-she ran the group -- I mean, she supervised a group of former prostitutes. 

Q: Yeah, okay, right. But tho-
those were her troops, right? 
A: Those were her troops. 

Q: Okay, okay. 

A: She had trained them, she had uniformed them and she d-dared them, ﬁAny of you 

to play your trade, you are going to be brai
ned.ﬂ And when they marched down the s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
63
 
 
 
down the street in a parade, you could -- I 
mean, you could just hold your stomach and 
laugh because she was kind of biggish and 
she had very bowlegged legs and she had 
the army  boots on and she had very short army  skirt. She was a sight.  

Q: Why do you think the author, the -- the fo
rmer director of the camp  called it the 
wild place? 

A: Because Wildeflecken
 means the wild place. 
Q: Oh, okay. 

A: Yeah, Wildeflecken is th e wild place in Germany. 

Q: Were there mo ments of real lighthe
artedness in the dis -- in Wildeflecken? 
A: Nine out of 10 hours were lighthe arted. Everybody was drunk with freedom. 

Everybody was comp letely intoxicated with
 freedom. When you thought back what 
was there before and what was then, it was 
just unbelievable. And when we talked or 
when I reflected occasionally, I saw myself
 in Gusensfie, getting off the train and 

walking under the viaduct to the tunnel, 
to dig and work. And over the viaduct, 
passing trains would be going 
on and people standing in th
e windows, leaning out of 
the windows, eating and drinking and billing 
-- being free. And saw those beautiful 
German, blonde girls leaning out and l
ooking on them and you heart was so sick 
looking at that freedom those people had 
and looking at yoursel
f, that you were going 
-- may be killed today or tomorrow or starve
 to death or drowned tonight by a capo or 
ha -- you head to -- was -- to -- bashed in
 that night by another capo. So then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
64
 
 
 
frequently, when you later on thought about 
this and about what was then, after 
liberation, you just were comp letely intoxicated with that freedom.  
Q: Were people talking about what had ha
ppened to them? Is that something that 
people had a need to go into detail about? Did you? 

A: A lot of people did. Lot of people shar
ed. Some people couldn™t. And many of us 
were quite abnormal. We hoarded food. We
 picked up every scrap of everything on 
the street. Even now, when I walk down the 
street and I see a penny, or a piece of 
paper, or an old shoelace, I pick it up. We
 just hoarded everything, because well, you 
never know. Maybe tomo rrow you are going to 
be hungry or maybe I want to tie my  
shoes and I wouldn™t have anything to tie th em with. And mo st of us kind of outgrew 

it and adjusted. At least, I hope I adjusted. 
I have some strange custom and habits and 
thoughts occasionally, but I don™t rave and don™
t -- well, don™t seem to be abnormal. I 
had a wife who lives with me forever a
nd she somehow stands me. But many of us 
became quite abnormal. I think I mentionedpreviously a father of a young girl I met 

here, who came to talk to me about the life there and I discover later on that he was a 

Jewish man. And I told her that she should ask him to tell her what happened to him. 

He survived the whole war in
 a Polish forest with a group of partisans, or by -- and by 
himself. He does not want to talk about it, not
 a word. He doesn™t want to talk, so I ask 
her to wor -- ﬁWell, ask him to write it down.ﬂ ﬁHe doesn™t know how to write.ﬂ 

ﬁWell, ask him to write in Polish.ﬂ ﬁHe doe
sn™t know how to write in Polish.ﬂ ﬁWell, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
65
 
 
 
how about Yiddish?ﬂ ﬁHe doesn™t know how to
 write it Yiddish.ﬂ He™s comp letely 
illiterate and he doesn™t want to talk about it. After all that time. 
Q: Can you tell us when and how you be 
-- you -- you became a stenographer for the 
police and I believe this was in Wildeflecken. 

A: Yes, I took a st-steno course in Ashafenberg 
just before I left and just before I left, I 
applied for a steno job with the police or th
e camp administrator office. And my best 
friend, Captain Psheckfass, who was a 
police commander there, he negated my  

application. Then, when we were
 transferred to Wildeflecken -- 
Q: Do you know why he did? 

A: He thought I was too foxy. He knew a little 
about my document washing, or else he 
had heard a rumo r about my  document washi
ng. He was afraid if I have access to 

documents, especially to the copies -- I me
an, to the f -- blanks of documents, I may 
sneak some out. By -- when I 
-- when we moved to Wildeflecken, he tried to do the 
same thing, but he was overruled by Captain 
Jaigiss, who was a liaison officer with the 
American army . And Mr. Jaigiss made he 
-- me his personal stenographer and he put 

me into the investigation -- into crime office. Made me into a great detective, which I 

wasn™t. 

Q: What did they know about your background,
 in terms of the war and the -- the -- 
your resistance? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
66
 
 
 
A: They knew that I was a former pris
oner. They didn™t know anything about my  
resistance work. 
Q: And you didn™t tell them? 

A: I did not. Occasionally I mentioned that 
I did some work before I was arrested. 
Especially, I -- well the -- they di -- ﬁYou got
 arrested, didn™t you?ﬂ ﬁWell, yes.ﬂ ﬁDid 

you steal a car? Did you steal a chicken?ﬂ I said
, ﬁWell, yes, something like that.ﬂ But 

there was no time to brag about that time. 
But later on, when they asked questions, I 
mentioned that I served in Polish underground.
 And especially in 1948, when I was in 

Wildeflecken, a British man came -- missions
 were coming, visiting camps and British 
man came for a visit and I was in the office and he came in the office and we 

recognized one another.  

Q: Where was he from? 

A: He was my trainer in Persia. 

Q: And his name was? 

A: Captain Thompson. Well, he were -- by that time he was Brigadier Thompson. 

Q: Can you tell us about that? Seeing him, talking to him? 

A: Oh, we had a short talk, then lunchtime he
 went to -- to our dining room and we sat 
and talked during the lunch time. And he sa
id, ﬁWell, not mu ch I can do for you, but I 
reread your reports just recently and your little
 group did as my -- as much damage as 
my  brigade -- OSS brigade did. So I™ll do so
mething.ﬂ And he actually did. The Polish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
67
 
 
 
authorities in Great Britain sent me a form 
to fill out and they wanted to give me 
Polish vertudtimilitary and I sent them a letter back, telling them what to put it in, 
where to stick it. Because, when we were figh
ting in Poland, they did not want to give 
any help to that part of underground that I wa
s in. And later on they wanted to share in 
the glory. 

Q: Who didn™t want to give any help? 

A: The Polish government in exile in Great  Britain. They helped only the Akar, the 

home army . They did not -- did not want to he
lp the NSZ, because we -- we were the -
- well, kind of perhaps, according to them, 
chauvinistic group. They didn™t want to 
have much to do with us. They would 
accept our reports. They would accept our 
reports, especially my  group and two other 
groups, they would accept the reports and 
send -- and give them to the British aut
horities, but they would not help us. 
Q: What kind of help did you need that they didn™t give? 

A: Plastic explosives. Some arms and amm
unition, especially British sten guns. They 
were very, very good, they were almo st as
 good as the German schmizers. We did not 
get any -- get any out of them. We did 
get some occasionally, but it was buying, 
stealing, smuggling. 

Q: What other things did you and the Brigadier General -- 

A: Thompson. 

Q: Thompson, speak of? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
68
 
 
 
A: Oh, we talked -- he talked about hi
s brigade, working --sending un -- sending -- 
flying people and dumping them in Germany 
behind the front lines and in occupied 
France. His brigade was fighting in Belg
ium. They would drop behind the German 
lines. And we talked about -- we talked a
bout, especially about the V2 that my  group 
fished out o-of Aboog River and the British se
nt a plane to ta -- to take it to Great 

Britain. The German flying bomb. 

Q: That™s the B2? 

A: V2, yes. 

Q: And he -- he knew about what you had done? 

A: He knew that. He knew it mu st not -- it was my  group who did it. 

Q: Did he recognize you right away when he walked in? 

A: Yes, he did. I recognized him, mainly
. But I said, ﬁMan, you got bald.ﬂ And he 
said, ﬁYou don™t have many hair, either.ﬂ He
 was a big, big man, probably six foot 
four or six foot five. And I reach about [inde
cipherable] just about to his -- to his hip. 
Q: And did you speak to him in English? 

A: No, we spoke German. 

Q: You spoke German? 

A: Yes. I knew -- I knew some English, but very -- we tri -- I tried to try my English 

on him, but he said, ﬁOh, forget it. Let™s 
pick German.ﬂ And he knew little Polish, too. 
We spoke German -- a gibberish of Polish and German. And I said, ﬁOh, Major 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
69
 
 
 
Thompson.ﬂ He said, ﬁBrigadier Thompson 
for you.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat happened to you? 
How do you get to be a Brigadier? You we
re just a Major. I don™t th-think even you 
were a Major, I think you were Captain.ﬂ ﬁOh yes, yes, I was a Major.ﬂ 

Q: But it was a good meeting? 

A: It was a good meeting, yes. Oh, he gave me
 si -- hi-his hat. He gave me his beret. 
Q: His beret? 

A: Yes. And I had it -- I wore it out comple
tely. Then short -- shortly -- I mean, a few 
years ago, I got one identical one. 

Q: What did he say when he gave it to you? 

A: ﬁI -- there™s nothing I can give you. W
hy don™t you have my  hat at least?ﬂ ﬁBut you 
are bald and your head when you -- you are going to be cold.ﬂ ﬁNever mind, I got one 

-- I got another. I have a formal one in my  baggage.ﬂ 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Stefan Czyzewski. This is tape number 
three, side B. So tell us a little bit about 
your job as a stenographer for the police department. 

A: The liaison officer would dictate to me
 and I would transcribe and he would -- 
letters to his -- people like him in the vari
ous different camps. He was kind of a head 
man of all of them and he would receive letters and he -- then he would write a lot of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
70
 
 
 
memo s, which I would write -- write and tran
scribe, then put in a file. And later on, 
when he relinquished me to the police de
partment, I would participate in -- in-
interrogation, when a few people were in
terrogating somebody, I would write it down 
and later transcribe. Then, when I interrogate
 -- later on, when I became detective, an 
interrogator myself, I would write in the shor
thand and later transcribe and make them 
-- I mean, ask them to sign, if they were w
illing. If they were not willing, they had to 
sign anyway. Little arm bending always helps.
 And later on, when I participating in 
some interrogation of Germans by the CIC 
people, I would take short hand, later 

transcribe it in Polish or German and so
mebody else would translate into English. 
Q: What kinds of police matters were 
being looked into in Wild-Wildeflecken? 
A: Thefts, robberies. Occasionally a murder. 
Then, there was a lot of medical malpra-
malpractice, people who were killed in abor
tions. Some suicides at the -- there was 
those ber -- bring -- that were suspected of 
-- as -- as murders. There was one some -- 
there was some fathers who abused
 their daughters sexually, and such. 
Q: So you would be asked to come in 
and take notes during an interrogation? 
A: I would have police bring that person to 
the office and I would interrogate them and 

write it down and then talk to them again and ask them if they were willing to sign 

whatever they told me. 
And in most cases, they were willing to sign. 
Q: Were you interviewing witnesses? 

A: Inter -- witnesses and perpetrators. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
71
 
 
 
Q: And perpetrators? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And how long did you do this for? 

A: Well, ‚48, ‚49. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And can you tell us a little bit about how -- how you made the 

transition from initially being sort of on the sidelines of events to actually being the 

person to do the interrogati
ng? How did that happen? 
A: We had a -- we had a criminal judge w
ho ran the department and we would -- each 
day, at the end of the day, we would be 
given an hour lecture on 
procedures and ways 
and -- and means. So, after a few months of that, mo st of us became quite adept 

interrogators and detectives. Went in the fi
eld work, had a shoot out occasionally with 
some people who were robbing and stealing. 

Q: In the camp? 

A: Outside of camp. People from camp  -- young men from camp would go into 

German countryside and rob and steal. 

Q: What -- how did you feel about the work? I mean -- 

A: Well, sometimes it was kind of difficult to go against your own and for the 

Germans, but this wa-was not the war a
ny more. That was freedom, that was a free 
country and a perpetrator is a perpetra
tor and consequently, you -- you don™t feel 

guilty about sending them to jail. Also, very 
few of them went to jail. Many of them 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
72
 
 
 
were kept in a -- in a camp jail for a few week
s, few months, but they were not sent to 
German prisons. And there were some ve
ry humorous things occasionally, like for 
instance, a group of boys went and they stol
e a cow. And they made the cow walk to 
the fifth floor, into the attic. They sla
ughtered it and were selling the meat. Somebody 
reported them and of course, I was assignedto it. I grabbed three policemen and we 
went up and we looked and we searched the 
whole block, we couldn™t find it. Then we 
went with an attic -- in the attic and sure, 
there was a whole lot of meat still left, a lot 
of bones. ﬁHow did you get the cow up here?ﬂ
 ﬁWell, she walked up the steps.ﬂ And 
later on, when I interrogated that [indeciphe
rable] perpetrators, said, ﬁWell, I didn™t 
see the cow. The cow just came to a block,
 walked up the steps. I couldn™t make her go 
down, so I had to kill her. And why waste all that good meat after I killed her? I got to 

do something. I couldn™t eat it all -- all by myself, so I had to sell some.ﬂ We heard 

many tall stories. And that was the tallest story ever. 

Q: Wh-What happened to him? 

A: He -- He got two -- two weeks in -- in 
camp prison, but he was released second day 
and made hard labor, chopping wood in the wood barn. 

Q: Can you talk a little bit more about making that transition from being in the war 

time, to actually then going against your ow n, as you said, or actually working with 

the Germans? How did you make 
that transition in your mind? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
73
 
 
 
A: Well, we actually, we never worked with
 the Germans. It was within the camp, 
working with the old people, the administ
ration of the camp was Polish. The police 
was Polish. The hospital doctors, medical pe
ople were Polish. So, you kind of worked 
against the element -- disruptive element in
 a camp that rest of the people did not 
approve of. Thiefs and robbers and there were
 a whole lot of -- well, quite a few cases 
of fathers abusing their daughters. Quite a few. Quite, quite a few.  
Q: How would you hear about those? 

A: Well, felt horrible. Matter of fact -- 

Q: How -- 

A: Oh, how you heard -- 

Q: How did you hear about them? 

A: People tell stories. In a close comm
unity, people know everybody™s else™s sins. 
Somebody would get mad with that person, 
report him and you went and called him in 
and if he didn™t want to come, you sent a 
uniformed policeman to bring him in. You 
talk to him, question him. Eventually, he
 would -- people have need to confess in 
many cases. Many of them would confess.  

Q: Is that something that in a small villa
ge in Poland, people w
ould have reported on? 
A: They -- They might -- 

Q: A -- an abuse of a -- of a daughter? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
74
 
 
 
A: They might have, but I had never -- never 
heard of an incident. Never heard of an 
incident back -- it mu st have existed, be
cause in any community, things like this do 
exist. But, it was never reported, it was 
never disclosed. I never heard of it. 
Q: So what would happen in a case like that? 
A: Well, he would get a jail sentence. In some
 cases, they would be se -- he would be 
sent to a German prison. There was one father that I had a case of, he was sent to a 

German prison for five years, but they let 
him out after one year. Matter of fact, his 
daughter came to America. I think is still liv
ing in Minneapolis, was a beautiful girl. 
Married somebody here, wer -- lived happily ever after. 

Q: Were there trials or was it decided mo re amongst the police? 

A: It was a trial. The camp administrator was a judge. There would be attorneys 

appointed or else, well, just called on, a
nd there were some attorneys in the camp. 
They were -- would be my old chief -- or 
chief [indecipherable] instructor in the 
investigation department, he would -- he w
ould be a prosecutor. He was a trained, 
Polish, pre-war prosecutor. Good, old man. 

Q: Wh-Who was this? 

A: A goo -- a -- he wa -- I mean, he was a go-good old man. 

Q: What was his name? 

A: His name was Mr. Clem Camage. And he talked blue streak and he made a lot of 

sense always. And he -- God, he was old,
 I don™t know how old he was, 50™s, 60™s, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
75
 
 
 
70™s. He was old and he was so proud becaus
e he lived with a pretty, young girl and he 
made her a baby. Well, those were tim
es, you know, everybody lived with everybody. 
A lot of men had wives back in Poland, they
 didn™t intend to go back, so they hitched 
up with somebody, sometime they did get ma
rried, sometime they did not. And they 
lived happily ever after, or for a short while, anyway. 
Q: How many cases did you come across 
of father - daughter sexual abuse? 
A: Well, I rememb  -- I could recall about 
s-seven during two years, but personally I 

had only one case. Mr. Psheckfass, who was by that time -- Mr. -- I mean Captain 

Psheckfass there, commander of the police 
in Wildeflecken said, ﬁYou are too young, 
you shouldn™t ca -- take cases like this.ﬂ  

Q: Can you tell us a bit about how you had 
an opportunity to become a detective? 
A: Mm-hm. It cas -- kind of happen almost 
by it™s own violition. It -- they had a group 

of detectives, some were trained, some 
untrained. So, then Mr. Clem Camage looked 
once and he said, ﬁWhy don™t you come to my  lectures? Why don™t you stay after 

work to my  lectures?ﬂ I stayed a few times
 and I listened. And he said, ﬁWouldn™t you 

like to work as an investigator?ﬂ I said, ﬁW
ell gee, sounds interesting.ﬂ So I kind of 
drifted into it. And then especially, shortly 
after I drifted into it, the CIC people came 
and talked to me, asked me if I w
ould like to work part time for them. 
Q: This is the United Stat
es counterintelligent corps? 
A: Yes, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
76
 
 
 
Q: How -- can you tell us about that meeting, the first time you met those people? 
A: They cames frequently to the camp and 
whenever they came
, they came to the 
police office -- offices and walked around a
nd talked to various people. They had 
some business occasionally. Sometime they ha
d no business, just came socially and 
one time Captain Vulcanovsky came to my  room to -- well, they were -- my  room, it 

were three of us in that room, three de
tectives and I was questioning somebody. So I 
stopped and he said, ﬁNevermind, nevermind, I™
ll just sit here, keep talking.ﬂ So I kept 
talking and then after I had that person si
gn his testimony -- I think it was a witness -- 
and leave, and said, ﬁWould you like to wo
rk for us?ﬂ ﬁDoing what?ﬂ ﬁWell, you 
know, catching the German criminals -- Nazi criminals and questioning them, would 

you like to help us?ﬂ ﬁOf course, but only pa
rt time, cause I™m working full time here, 
I get paid here.ﬂ ﬁOkay, I™ll call on you.ﬂ So
, every fi -- week, every two weeks, they 
would take me away for a day or two. I 
would get the permission from Mr. -- Captain 
Psheckfass to go. And sometime was on -- 
sneaking to East Germany and bringing 
back somebody or another. Sometime it was interrogation. Some of the -- who were 

questioned, were of Polish German -- so 
Polish descent, so they gave me those 
especially to -- to question. So I would 
spend five, eight, 10 - 15, up to about 20 hours 
talking to them and, ﬁWell, you know, your 
method works.ﬂ ﬁOf course it does.ﬂ Give 
them lot of water or coffee. Don™t let him 
go to the bathroom for the duration. Let -- 
let him do what he has to do right wher
e he sits, he will tell you everything. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
77
 
 
 
Q: That was your method? 
A: That was my  method. 

Q: And where had you learned that? 

A: Well, two guesses. Gestapo. Cause the Ge
stapo beat me, too. We were not allowed 
to touch those people. Don™t let him sleep fo
r a couple days, then I™ll come and talk to 
him. Take his belt off, whenever he gets up, his pants fall down. 

Q: Can you tell us about going into East 
Germany and bringing someone back? How -
- How did you know who to bring back 
and how did you do it? Did you have a 
weapon with you? How did that work? 

A: Yes, w-we -- we went -- went in arme
d. We™d normally drive to the border at 
nightfall and walk across. And they knew 
who they were looking for. They had 

intelligence in East Germany. Sometime they
 would legally drive into East Germany 
and bring somebody across. Or go and talk to
 that person and tell him that, ﬁYou will 
be taken to West Germa
ny, do you want to go willingl
y?ﬂ Many of them went 
willingly, because by that time, life in East
 Germany was bad. In West Germany was 

wor -- bad, but better. And some who didn™t wa nt to go, were kind of encouraged to 

go. Hom -- some who refused to go, next 
day somebody would be sent to shoot them. 
Q: How did that work? 

A: Well, I -- I was not asked to go and shoot
. Anyway, I heard -- if it was true or not, 
but I heard that. Captain Vulcanovsky would co
me in, ﬁOh, that so and so that we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
78
 
 
 
went to talk didn™t want to come.ﬂ And I say, ﬁYeah, I rememb er him.ﬂ ﬁWell, you can 
say a prayer for him.ﬂ  

Q: And who were -- who were these people 
mostly? What -- what were they wanted 
for? 

A: They were SS guards, they were co -- 
gareekt -- court judges. You know, they had 
Na-Nazis appoin-appointed volk gareekt j
udges -- anybody, picked them up to -- to 
give death sentences. Anybody who comes, 
death sentence, death sentence or 
concentration camp, whatever. They were 
just local, rabid Nazis who judged people 

for almost anything, any little trespass. If 
you were foreign worker, you -- they would 
sent you to concentration camp or have 
you hunged. If you went to -- slept -- if a 

German woman encouraged young Polish or 
Russian boy to sleep with her, it was 

found out, death sentence immediately. 
Took him out and hunged him on the nearest 
tree. But it had to be cour-court case in 
a gareekt loytemp people -- people would mete 
out death sentences. So, many of those we
re apprehended and information on them 
collected. And some of them were de-Nazi
fied, th-they were interrogated and found 
that they were not really great perpetrato
rs, they were just mitlowfers or kind of 
helpers uppers, but not really criminals, and le
t out. And all of them were glad to stay 
in West Germany. But some were sent
 to prisons, went through court system. 
Q: And tell us a little bit about the experi
ence of sitting across from some of these 
people who were SS guards or -- or judges,
 who™d had a part in the violence and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
79
 
 
 
oppression that you experienced, what was it 
like to sit across from them and ask them 
questions? 
A: Well you -- you tried to question this pers
on as a person, but you felt about him like 
a vermin. In my  case, I knew what happened -- what was done to me by mine 

interrogator and two or three of his henchmen, who beat the bijesus out of me. And 

you -- you could see that those people might
 have done, so you question them and 
question them and question them and if th
ere were any witnesses, you questioned the 
witnesses and you confronted them with th
e witnesses and you felt like bashing their 
heads in, but of course, you were not allowe
d to touch them, so you kept them for 18 
hours talking and you give them a lot to drink and, ﬁI want to go to the bathroom.ﬂ 

ﬁForget it. You go to the bathroom when I 
tell you to go to the bathroom.ﬂ It didn™t 
feel so great. You didn™t feel good humiliati
ng them, but you felt like doing it. You felt 
like that was your duty to -- to really find out if
 he is innocent or if he really was guilty 
and if turned out that he really couldn™t 
prove anything against him, that you felt bad 
because you mistreated the person. You made
 him wet his pants many times when he 
sat in the front of you. 

Q: Was it something that you wanted to continue doing? 

A: An -- I did not want to do it again, ever, in
 my life. But at that time, I was interested 
in it. I wanted to do it and mainly I wanted to help, to weed out those who were real 

henchmen, mu rderers, criminals, who woul
d -- who should not be fr -- walking free. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
80
 
 
 
But, of course, the sentences they received we
re just nothing. Four years, five years, 
10 years. He would serve 12 months and woul
d be released in a good behavior. It was 
just -- I mean, it was almo st -- almo st a joke. But, we thought, well, at least something, 

at least -- at least something. There™s going -- going to be a black mark on his 

documents and he would not be allowed 
to perform within the population. For 
instance, getting -- be-becoming important person, or -- or getting a job. Forget it. 

Every one of them got a good job later on. They
 helped one another. One did get in, he 
pulled all 10 of them in. There were a lot 
of German police in the German army -- 

West German army. There were a lot in -- in
 -- in -- in intelligen
ce, a lot of former 
perpetrators were with Gellen in -- outside 
of Frankfort, helping Americans against the 
Soviets. 

Q: How did this affect or shape your idea of justice after the war? 

A: I was quite skeptical. First I thought we
 are performing great service and kind of 
making them pay. Later on, it became a big 
joke and you became skeptical. But things 
of the world are as they are. It is next
 to impossible to punish somebody for crimes -- 

cruelty, or else whatever they did. It wa
s next impossible of punishing them, except 

sending them to the holy inquisition. Putting 
them in a wheel to stretch their arms, 
break their joints and so on and so fort
h. And of course, nobody was allowed to do 
that. There was one American, Captain Bo
llack, he was from Hammtrack, Michigan. 
He would get occasionally short tempered a
nd he would hit wildly. But after one or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
81
 
 
 
two times, I didn™t want to be with him a
ny more and when he -- when I interrogated 
somebody, I ask him, ﬁPlease, Captain Bolla
ck, don™t come.ﬂ Because he would hit.  
Q: Was -- how did you come to a decision 
that you didn™t want to hit? Because 
certainly, in your first interview, you told
 the story about coming across your German 
interrogator, and you could have hit him.  

A: I could have, yes, yes. 

Q: Ho-How did you come to that decisi
on, if you could talk a bit about that? 
A: Well, I cou -- looked at him -- him, I looke
d at my self. He was a big, strong man. I 

was a little, tiny sprout. And him mistreated me as he -- as he did, I said, ﬁDo -- Do I 

want to be like you were? I don™t.ﬂ So, when 
I questioned him, he said, ﬁWell, I was 
doing my  job.ﬂ ﬁDid you have to do what you 
did to me?ﬂ ﬁWell, I was doing my  job.ﬂ 
So, he say, ﬁIf you have to do your job, 
you can do it to me anything you want to.ﬂ 
Yeah, he was quite resigned by then. 

Q: This was Hans Christian. 

A: Yes, Hans Christian [indecipherable] 
name Mr. Meyer, or whatever he called 
himself. I don™t even know if his na -- real na
me was Hans Christian, but I did find his 
transcript of his Ph.D. degree at the -- at th
e Heidelberg University. He had a Ph.D. in 
criminal justice and Ph.D. in Christian theology. 

Q: Okay, let™s see. So how long did you do th
e work for the counter
intelligence corps? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
82
 
 
 
A: From 1940 -- early ‚48 through 1949, until I le
ft in September for America. About -
- almost two years. Maybe little less than 
two years, maybe a little more then two 
years. 

Q: I want to ask you something about the 
camp  and people™s sexual behavior, really. 
You had mentioned the -- the former prostitu
tes, but that they were under control. 
A: Oh, were they ever. 

Q: And then you mentioned that people were
 living together and then you mentioned 

the fathers abusing the daughters. And I 
guess what I™d like you to talk a little bit 
about is, what was the atmo sphere generally? People™s sexual behavior in the camps? 

A: It wasn™t any worse than it was in a -- in normal, general population. At the 

beginning maybe it was little worse, because there were a lot of young, unattached 

people who paired on and paired off, but the in
fluence of the Catholic church was very 
strong in the camp. There were priests, ther e were chapels, there were churches. And 

people went to Confession, people went to  Communion. People went to Mass. Hardly 

anybody ever missed a Mass, except some hoo
ligans who thought the -- there was few 

concentration -- former concentration camp 
inmates who lost belief in God, because 
they said, ﬁIf something like this happened,
 God does not exist.ﬂ But very, very few, 
so it wasn™t much worse than
 anywhere else. And, since li -- people lived in such a 
close proximity, you know, five, six, seven, well, the room I was in was smaller than 

this room. One room, there were five of
 us living in it. Some-Sometime 11 people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
83
 
 
 
lived in a room -- room of this size.
 Everybody knew everythi
ng about everybody else. 
So, if something happens, well, watch out, 
you get deported and a priest would come 
to talk to you and say, ﬁYou inferial so
 and so, you better not do it.ﬂ Well, some 
people lived together and it was -- that was kind of almo st semi-accepted. They are 

lonely, they  have nobody else, they have
 somebody to take care of them. And many 
people who were supposed to be leaders or
 else people to give good example, or 
people to enforce the proper behavior, did 
not behave properly themselves. Like my  
immediate superior of a investigation department, a judge Clem Camage, he lived with 

a pretty, young girl and they had a baby a
nd he was so damn  proud of that baby. 
End of Tape Three, Side B

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Stefan Czyzewski. This is tape num
ber four, side A. Did you live with anybody? 
A: I didn™t. Sorry to say. I was extremely fond of many girls. I fell in love with a 

French doctor -- lady doctor, who was my  
doctor. Beautiful, young girl who just got 
out of medical school. She volunteered to go 
and she was in Forheim sanitorium, she 
was my doctor. We became very friendly, she -- we went on a trip, she me -- 

requisitioned a Jeep. We went to see her 
family, stayed for a week, 10 days in 
Versailles, outside of Paris, saw the sight
s, came back. When I went to a different 
sanitorium, well, she came to see me a fe
w times, but nothing developed. And, I don™t 

know. All my  childhood, I always was very fond 
of girls, just extremely fond of girls. 
I always had three steady ones and maybe two 
extra. After the war, I was, for a long -- 

some time, very friendly with a Russian girl
, then I was quite friendly with the Italian 
girl. Then, when I came to W
ildeflecken, a lady secretary in the next office, said, 
ﬁBanya Stefanya, why don™t you come and visit 
us?ﬂ ﬁWell, I™ll be glad to visit you, 
but why should I come and visit you?ﬂ ﬁWell, 
I have a beautiful daughter.ﬂ ﬁOh, when 

do I come?ﬂ So, of course it was -- it -- Good Friday came and she said, ﬁWell, why 

don™t you come tomo rrow? Have a light lunc
h after work, we leave at noon. And so 
we can go to visit the -- the tomb ,ﬂ you know
, we™re going into the church and -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
85
 
 
 
praying in the front of the effigy of -- 
of Christ. ﬁWe can have lunch and you -- you 
and Hanka can -- Hanka can go and visit the to
mb s.ﬂ So I went and visit the -- I had a 
li-light lunch and I went with Hanka to -- to visit the 
 
Q: I guess -- I want to ask this. I -- I™ve read about the camp s and in some cases, 
people are really just sitting and waiti
ng. However, speaking to you, you are so 
engaged with your life, the immediate lif
e that™s around you. You™re working and 

you™re -- you™re being promoted from a stenogr
apher to a detective. How did you feel 

at that time about your life and what -- wh
at was ma -- what you were maybe going to 
end up doing? 

A: I felt very lucky to be able what I di
d. And apparently, people who --  people who 
helped me apparently thought that I wa
s worth a little. Also, it will probably seem 
pathetic, because those two people who 
helped me the most
, spent time in a 
concentration camp also, or else a prisone
r™s of war camp  and those two people, 
Captain Psheckfass and Mr. Shimienski, who was a camp commander -- police 

commander in Ashafenberg and also worked 
in a policer in Wild eflecken, was very 
symp athetic and very  helpful. Later on, when
 I got to know Lieutenant Penjik, he also 
helped me survive in the -- in the police department. He was one of the dignitaries 

there who did not very mu ch, but was a ve
ry elegant person, a well-spoken person. 
The drinkit -- drinkest person I ever met a
nd we were very close friends and they 
always thought, ﬁThat little boy, I got to help  him.ﬂ And they did. So I felt very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
86
 
 
 
fortunate and I tried to do my  best whe -- 
in whatever I did and in mo st cases, 
apparently succeeded because I was never ca
nned. I was never fired. I was called on 
the carpet from time to time and told what
 should not be done 
and what should be 
done, but never was really punished, as my
 document states. He is going to United 
States and he was never punished, except before. 

Q: When you look back at your time, par
ticularly as in the underground, how do you 
account for your choices? Your choices which 
were almo st instinctively to fight and 
resist, versus just obeying the Germans 
or trying to wait it out. How do you account 
for those choices you made?  

A: Well, I thought that -- I thought it was i
nborn, because all my  forefathers were 
fighters and active. I had a grand-grand-
grandfather who fought the Soviet -- the 
Soviet -- the Russian Souse regime and ende
d in say -- with a death sentence and later 
on was commu ted to 25 years in Siberia. 
I had people who fought with the Polish 

legion during Napoleonic wars. I 
had forefathers who had served in diplomatic service 

and were active. I had my  father, who wore
 -- fought in the first World War on three 
fronts. He fought with the Russians agains
t the Prussians and 
with the Prussians 
against the French, with the 
-- with the French and Polish 
against the Germans. So I 
guess, if it wasn™t inborn, at least I coul
d think back about it and act accordingly. 
Didn™t want to be bystander. And of course
, my  ego was enormous. I knew I could do 
almo st anything, and went and mo st of the time I didn™t, sometime I did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023

Q: An-And if you could talk a little bit about
 the Polish culture in terms of how to 
react to authority. A German survivor -- I re
ad that she said as 
a German, she just -- 
just obeyed when they -- when
 the SS told her to do something, she did it and she -- 
she went to camp and she never considered
 saying no. What about the Polish culture 
and -- and within your own family, wh
at kind of things were you taught? 
A: Polish people in the first place, are ve
ry contrary. Also very disputatious. You 
would say -- have four Poles dis-discussing 
certain set of ideas. They would have 
seven ideas and nobody gives. C
onsequently, when we get 
hit, we hit back hard. 
Poland, in history, was overran many tim
es by neighbors who were 10 times mo re 
powerful. Poland was divide
d and subdivided by three ne
ighbors who were -- each one 
was three times as big as Poland and bei
ng under occupation of Prussia, Austria and 
Russia, Poland had, oh my  God, probably ha
lf a dozen really heavy uprisings and 
probably dozen and a half of smaller uprisi
ngs. They were being killed, they were 
being hung, they were drowned, they were se
nt to Siberia. They were -- spent time in 
Magdaburg -- German citadel prison. Polish -- cr
eator of Polish state, after first World 
War, Marshall Pisoutski spent couple years in
 a German prison in Madgaburg. So, we 
kind of thought that we are the fighting peopl
e and we tried to prove it. Most of the 

time we did not succeed, at times we did. Th
at was probably kind of loyalty to -- to 
your state, loyalty to your nation, especia
lly, and acting upon it. And probably mo st of 
the -- mo st of it is that we are qu -- we 
were quite foolhardy. When I corresponded 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
88
 
 
 
with my  first cousin, who spent about 10 ye
ars in a Communist prison -- after she was 
released, we wrote to each other before sh
e died. I said, ﬁWell gee, why didn™t you go 
out and fight [indecipherable]ﬂ And she sa
id, ﬁWe have grown now. We want to 
conduct ourself properly, we want to go by 
vote, we want to go and work hard and 
perhaps we will succeed. We must have gr
own.ﬂ Well, when I knew Poland and when 
I knew my self and my  se -- environment during the war and before the war, looks like 
we have not grown yet, we just we
nt and hid and fight -- and fought.  
Q: I want you to think back to the point
 when you were in the dis -- in -- in 
Wildeflecken and when you found out -- no, 
let me ask you this first, why did you 
want to emigrate to the United States? 

A: For the simple reason that, as I menti
oned before, that was a seventh heaven. And 
everybody wanted to go to America. And I 
had had friends -- close friends and the 
wife of the family worked 
for the emigration office to America and he hel -- she 
helped to put me on the list. And eventua
lly my name came, my number came, I was 

called in and was asked to collect documen
tation and went through the doctors and -- 

and all kind of commissions, question this
 and question that, went through the 
consulate. Especially I had a hard time with a doctor or else I didn™t have a hard time 

with a doctor, but Captain Vulcanovsky sa
id, ﬁWell, you have -- your lungs are 
scarred. You™ll never go to America. Come 
on, let™s have your documents.ﬂ So he took 
my little card with the x-ray on it and he said, ﬁHere, stick this one on.ﬂ ﬁWhat is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
89
 
 
 
that?ﬂ ﬁThis is my  x-ray, I never had any 
problem with lungs.ﬂ That was it, I came 
under false pretenses. I came here as a form
er tuberculosis patient, almo st dying there 
and I haven™t been sick a day since I came here. 
Q: But your captain put his picture? 

A: His -- His x-ray -- 

Q: Instead of yours? 

A: Instead of mine. Even though they still -- 
there was still that little typed line that I 
could not -- I could not launder. It says, ﬁP
leveredes maxudatevair.ﬂ So then doctor -- 
American doctor looks and say, ﬁYou had 
the Pleveredes maxudatevair here. How 
come your lungs are so clear?ﬂ I said, ﬁOh, it cleared up.ﬂ And he said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ I 

understood the okay. He spoke to the interp
reter and my English was kind of a little -- 
Q: So without that clear x-ray, you wouldn™t have been able to come? 

A: Possibly not. 

Q: I see. 

A: I may -- there might have been special -- certain consideration, because the CIC 

people said, ﬁIf any problems you have, just
 call us and we™ll come and round those 
bureaucrats down.ﬂ But possibly I could [indeci
pherable]. Americans at that time were 

deathly afraid of tuberculosis. 

Q: Who paid for you to come? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
90
 
 
 
A: Government funds paid for the crossi
ng of the ocean. We came on a troop ship. 
Troop ship that normally took about 400 
people, had 17 people -- hundred people on 
board. Were kind of -- 

Q: 1700? 

A: 1700. And our trip from New York to Sa
int Paul, Minneapolis was paid by U.S. 
Catholic Conference. Later, I repaid them
. Later, I called on the -- on the Immigration 
Department and ask me -- asked if I could re
pay the trip -- the trip across the ocean, 
they said, ﬁForget it. U.S. governor paid fo
r it, you are going to pay in taxes.ﬂ So when 
I worked the first three months in that 
year and I never had anybody do my  tax return, 
I did it my self. I did it with a dictionary a
nd things and I put a wrong word there on the 
first tax return. There was a clause that 
said, ﬁDo you owe any taxes for the previous 
years?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ I was getting official
 letters for months and years. ﬁWe have 
searched and we cannot find that you owe any 
taxes, can you enlighten us?ﬂ It finally 
dawned upon me what I did and I wrote a grea
t letter of pol -- of apology. I said I was 
a greenhorn, I did it all by my self and I ma
de a mistake. Because, you know, working 
only three months in that year, I got all my  
taxes back. But I made a mistake that I owe 
taxes for the previous years. 

Q: Tell us the name of the ship that you came on. 

A: General Hersey -- Hersey. 

Q: Can you tell us where it docked -- where it came into port in the United States? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
91
 
 
 
A: Yeah, it started from Bremenhoffen in Germany. Oh, I™m sorry, started in Hamburg 
Altoona. We were going to Bremenhoffen, 
but we did not, we can -- started from 
Altoona and it came to New York and docked just
 close to the Statue of Liberty, I had 
some pictures made of it in a -- in a kind of
 a hazy light. And were processed right in 
the dock and local Polish committee people took us
 to the train, we had train tickets. I 
went on a train and got to Chicago. From Chicago -- 

Q: Oh, I want to ask -- do you rememb er 
co-coming in to -- do you rememb er New 
York coming into sight and the Statue of Liberty? 

A: Yes, it was -- it was just about four in 
the mo rning and the Statue of Liberty was 
kind of visible, you know, in a fog [indeciphera
ble], ﬁOh, my  God, look at that darn 
thing standing up there. Oh, how tall it is
, how big it is.ﬂ But we docked quite a 
distance from it, that -- the -- I can™t rememb
er what dock it was. But we surely saw 
the Statue of Liberty. I have a -- somewher
e, a faded picture to prove it, standing on 
the side of a ship and somebody took my  pictur
e with -- with the Statue of Liberty in 
the background.  

Q: What were your first impressions of -- 
of the United States as you came off the 
boat? 

A: Oh, the noise. A lot of people, traffic. Oh
 my God, the traffic. When we -- I think 
there was a old Polish committee lady who took three of us and I don™t even know 

which train depot we went to, but oh, the tra
ffic, we were just ogling the traffic and all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
92
 
 
 
the -- all of the people on the sidewalks 
and all those buildings and all this 
crowdedness. But especially all those cars
 and everybody drives at a breakneck speed 
and everybody honks their horn. It
 was just flabbergasting. 
Q: So someone met you, took you to the trai
n station and put you right on the train? 
A: Put on the train with a ticket and -- and a tag saying that if -- ﬁThis person speaks 
no English, if you can help him, please do.
ﬂ So of course, pretty soon a pretty, young 

woman came and sat next to me and she s
poke little German. Asked me who I was and 
what I was and we talked blue streak all wa
y to Chicago. And then I had a stay over in 
Chicago, about two hours, so she took -- we
 -- she was from Hammtrack, Michigan, I -
- she -- I think. She was changing the trains, too. So, she went -- I -- we went out, she 

bought me a lunch. We went walking around a
nd we took a train -- se -- se -- streetcar 
and we went to a certain direction, came b
ack a different direction. And then she put 
me back on the train and that was it. I even have a picture of her somewhere. 

Q: She sort of took you on a mini sightseeing trip? 

A: She took me on a mini sightseeing. It 
was plump, young lady. And I said, ﬁWell, 
gee, are all American people fat? Look at 
that beautiful, fat lady.ﬂ And the boys who 

were with me were so jealous. ﬁGee, why 
couldn™t she pick me up? It™s you, you are 
nothing. I™m a good looking, tall, blonde man,  why does she have to pick on you?ﬂ  

Q: Was there a point, or at what point in
 the trip -- perhaps it was when you were 
getting on the boat, or you were on the ship
 coming across the ocean, or somewhere 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
93
 
 
 
else where you -- it began to sink in that you 
really were coming to the United States, 
embarking on a new life? 
Q: Well, I -- it didn™t come to me until I la
nded in New York. Say, ﬁOh my God, what 
I™m going to do this busy country?ﬂ Before
, it was just like a dream, you know, taking 
off and going somewhere, like flying, you know
, bird flying. And I looked and I was 
so lucky because I didn™t get seasick. I ate 
myself sick couple times -- ate myself sick. 
But I wasn™t seasick. Everybody was not able
 to eat and they™re going over -- over the 
side and doing things and I even got a job. 
I became a typist. There was a Polish paper 
being published on the ship. So I typed the 
art -- somebody dictated, I took shorthand, 
I typed the copy of it and then corrected it 
and pretty soon there came a little two page 
paper for the Polish people. 

Q: Do you have a copy of that? 

A: I don™t. I wish I would have kept a copy. I did not.  

Q: So, continue telling the story. Then 
you got -- you were in Chicago and you got on 
another train? 

A: Chane -- the train came to Saint Paul 
and there were some people waiting for us 
from the Polish American club here. 

Q: You™re still with your two friends? 

A: Still with my two friends. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
94
 
 
 
A: Yes. Actually, it was -- one was to di
semb ark in Chicago. Another boy was coming 
here. And then we met a lady -- older lady who was coming also here. She was a 
refugee, too. So we came to Saint Paul 
and there were Polish people from the Polish 
American club. And there was an attorney, 
Mr. Nahourski, who came also that day. 
And one of the Polish people walked me to a barber shop downtown, where my  

sponsor was a barber. It was old Mr. 
Proekopovich who was my  sponsor. He was 
asked -- people were asked by the U.S. Catho
lic Conference to sponsor certain people. 

So he and his wife signed up [indecipherable]
 want a young man to stay with them and 
they would provide you with room and boa
rd until you found a job. And so I went on 
a streetcar with Mr. Proekopovich -- no, I™m 
sorry, he had an old, beaten up jalopy. 
God, was about 20 years old, was falling 
apart, but he was so proud of his own 
automobile -- driving. I rememb er his [inde cipherable] his knuckles were white on his 

steering wheel and he was tall and looking 
straight ahead and 
driving and honking the 
horn. 

Q: And this, what year is this? 

A: It was in 19 -- in September, 1959.  

Q: No. ‚59? 

A: ‚59. 

Q: No, no, ‚49. 

A: I™m sorry, I™m sorry, ‚49. Oh my
 God, 10 years before. No, ‚49. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
95
 
 
 
Q: September 1949. 
A: 1949, yes. 

Q: Okay, good. When you were coming over on 
the boat, or perhaps on the train, was 
there talk -- well, what -- what were you 
talking about with the other refugees? 
A: We just wondered who we meet, who we 
are going to stay with. The trepidation of 
-- of -- of not knowing the language too well.
 Also, I could write and read English 
quite well by then, but before I left, my Br itish girl teacher said, ﬁWell, you are going 

to America. Those people haven™t spoken E
nglish for last couple hundred years. You 
will have a hard time with them.ﬂ I did, 
for about six months. We swallow a lot of 
suffixes, we don™t enunciate properly. We 
-- We garble sentences, according to the 
British. It took about six months to adjust
 to American English. I still spoke broken 
English when I met Sylvia. Every -- every 
-- every pot I used to call jar. Frying pan 
and -- and -- and a cooking pot, everything was 
jar as far I was -- I was concerned.  

Q: What was your first room like 
with your sponsor -- your sponsors? 
A: Well, the lady of the house had a big 
supper waiting and well, I wasn™t very 
hungry. Also, I hardly ate anything on the trai
n. I was given five dollars in New York 
and I brought the five dollars to Saint 
Paul. The American lady bought me a little 
lunch and she bought me a sandwich on the tr
ain and the little lunch -- I think it was a 
hamburger that we ate in Chicago. And th
e lady of the house made a big supper. Was a 
meat roast and a lot of potatoes. And they 
had big, black olives. And I was sure those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
96
 
 
 
were plums, so I took quite a few. And I ca
n™t stand olives. At that time I didn™t know 
what olives were. I still can™t stand olives
. And I choked in and ate those three, huge, 
black olives. I just didn™t dare to put them 
back. So I choked them in. I almo st felt -- I 
felt sick after eating those -- those -- those big plums. 
Q: What did they tell you about the country that you had just arrived in? What kind of 

advice did they give you? 

A: Well, they told me all kind of things. 
ﬁWell, you will be a greenhorn here for a long 
time. People call people like you greenhorn.
ﬂ ﬁWhat is greenhorn?ﬂ ﬁWell, you know, 
jerno nerogie, young bullock with -- with 
green horns. And they will call you names, 
they will call you Polack, they will call you th
is, they will call you that. But lo -- don™t 
let it worry you. Most of them are quite stupid people.ﬂ 

Q: They said that? 

A: They said that, yes. Like, ﬁMost pe
ople are stupid. Those who will call you names 
are stupid people, so don™t pay attention 
to them. The people who know, won™t bother 
you.ﬂ  

Q: And can you tell us about what you did then? 

A: Well I -- I was in with them for about th
ree, four days and I cleaned up and washed 
up the whole basement. It was just rec
onverted from coal to oil heat. And I 
whitewashed it and I washed and took all the rust off the old car and repainted and 

repolished it. It was gleaming like a -- like a newly born baby. And I mo w the grass 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
97
 
 
 
and I made my  50 -- first 50 cents. Next 
door lady was cleaning a house. I went, help 
her clean it up and I took her carpets out and 
put them on a fence and beat the carpets 
and I made whole 50 cents, big 50 cent
s piece. And my  neighbor was a post -- 
mailman. And he was making the lordly sum 
of 50 dollars a week. And I said, ﬁOh my  
God, if I ever make 50 dollars a week in 
America, I will never want any more.ﬂ Ha. 
And then, about a week later, I met -- well, 
few days later I went to Polish American 
club and made -- make -- made-- met some 
local people. There was one person who 
said, ﬁWell, I™ll take you with me. Come 
tomo rrow mo rning.ﬂ So he took me to his 

factory. It was a cabinet shop. It was a ca
sket comp any. He said, ﬁErnie, the man who 
owns it and runs it, is an old Deutschman, 
so I™ll let you talk to him.ﬂ So I went and 
spoke to Ernie, who was a Mr. Rife, a very 
dignified old gentleman. And he asked me 
if I spoke German. ﬁSelps forshtanley, I 
speak Deutsch, I speak Deutsch.ﬂ So we 
talked. He said, ﬁWell, actually, I don™t have
 a job here for you, but you just come, I™ll 
give you a job.ﬂ [indecipherable] workers 
having do a certain kind of work here, 
which it was -- I sta -- ﬁJust come to me 
every noon on your lunch hour and we™ll talk 
German.ﬂ So, we went every hou -- every lunc
h I went to his office, which was like a 

mu seum and we talk German and pretty s
oon I -- they found me something to do and I 
stayed there until the place closed, which wa
s about a year later.  He employed people 
-- some of his people in their -- in their 70™s and 80™s, who slept mo st of the time, 

didn™t produce very mu ch. So, the place got broke.

End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Stefan Czyzewski. This is tape number four, side B. 
A: So Mr. Rife, after he closed the place, he
 kept the superintendent there, and me for 
about six mo re months, liquidating the plac
e. We were cleaning up, taking stuff out. 
He had in his office a Indian and first Am
erican artifacts, probably more than the 

Science Museum had in Minnesota. So he dona
ted mo st of the stuff there and some of 
it he took to his ranch that he had in Wiscons
in, or to his big home in north Saint Paul. 
And eventually he had to let me go and gave
 me a memento or two. So that was my  
first job. 

Q: And then what did you do? Did you [indecipherable] 

A: And then -- 

Q: How old were you? 

A: I was in my  mid-twenties that time. 25 - 26? Then I found a job, I became a gandy 

dancer on a railroad. I worked there for almo st a -- about a year. 

Q: Remind us what a gandy dancer does? 

A: Gandy dancer is the person who fixes up 
the track when you lay a new tie under the 

rail, it is loose. So you keep pouring crus
hed rock and keep -- and you put your heavy 
shovel among the crushed rock and you hold it 
up or top with your hands -- the top of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
99
 
 
 
the shovel. And you put your foot on the 
shovel down below and press on it and you 
rock back and forth, back and forth, pushi
ng the stone under the tie, so eventually the 
tie becomes tight against the rail. So peopl
e doing this kind of work were called gandy 
dancers. I was a gandy dancer on a railroad section for almo st a year. 

Q: Did you like that work?  

A: I didn™t dislike it. It was healthy,
 it was outdoors. Although, when Minnesota 
winter came, it was a little oppressive. When I was coming to Minnesota, I thought it 

was wine country, because Minnesota in the 
same parallel that is Matz in France, 
which is a wine -- wine -- Champagne count ry. When I came here, I found Minnesota 

to be identical to Poland. Same summer, sa
me winter except in Minnesota, winter is 
month and a half longer.  

Q: How did you feel? Did -- were you making frie
nds or did you feel isolated at all in 
those first two years? 

A: No, I didn™t feel isolated at all, be
cause all the newcomers are going once a ni -- 
week -- a night -- one night a week to the In
ternational Institute, which is in -- well, 
it™s kind of all over the United States, who 
teaches English to foreign born and helps 
them to gain citizenship if 
they™re interested. So then I 
met a lot of Polish Ukrainian 
Russian boys and girls who came almo st the same time or just about that time. Many 

of them bought cars, so we would go get into
 cars and we would go to the park and 
play tennis and go swimming and go girls -- 
girls chasing and do all kind of guy stuff. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
100
 
 
 
Q: And how did people in the city trea
t you? Americans in general? You were 
someone who didn™t speak English fluently at
 this point. Did you ever feel unwanted? 
A: Not really. No, sometime I felt intimid
ated. But I haven™t met anybody who would 
misstate me. My boss at work in the ca
sket comp any would call me, ﬁHey you, 
greenhorn, come on here. Do this and do that
.ﬂ But he was kind of a tough fellow, but 
he was goodhearted. Next hour, he would come
 and give me half of his sandwich and 
say, ﬁCome on, hide over there and eat 
it, because you look hungry and you so skinny. 
Why don™t you eat some more?ﬂ And I neve
r felt mistreated by anybody. Later on, 
when I developed -- learned my  halfway dece
nt English and did get my  present job, I 
felt, you know, good about my self, because th ere were people who did not have as 

good a job as I had, even though I was always
 paid poorly and still am. But I did not 
make here to make fortune. I came here to
 gain freedom. I wake up in the mo rning and 
I think about it, I say, ﬁMan, I feel so free.ﬂ Which I do. And say a prayer.  

Q: How often d-do you have a flashback to
 the war and to the time that you didn™t 
have your freedom? 

A: Occasionally, but very seldom. Occasiona
lly when I -- I do go and give talks to 
schools -- high schools, colleges and places -- groups of people, I™ll talk about the 

Holocaust -- about the war time, and so on. 
I have flashes occasionally after that, and 
that -- until we met last time in May, whenev
er  I went to give a talk, I had some 
sleepless nights after that, you know, the th
ings were coming back. But when we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
101
 
 
 
talked for six and a half or seven hours last 
May, I said, ﬁOh my  God, I won™t be able 
to sleep for next two weeks.ﬂ You know, I 
slept like a log. It mu st have been 
therapeutic. And things hardly ever flash back. Occasionally -- occasionally, I think 
about people who were worthy of survival, worthy of a good life, but did not make it. 

A lot of them. There were a lot of people w
ho were better than I and they were worthy 
people, educated people, great people even. 
They couldn™t make it. I frequently think 
of those people and frequently say a prayer for them. 

Q: Are the feelings guilt feelings that you made it? 

A: At times I feel guilty. At times I feel 
[indecipherable]. I should have helped that 

one, that time, I should have helped this one, 
this time. Was I able to help him? Was I 
able to help him without forfeiting my life? 
 At [indecipherable] I think that I could 
have and I didn™t and I do feel guilty about it. 

Q: But when you said you wake up and you th
ink about freedom, that is something 
that you think of every day, but that is not
 necessarily in relation to your lack of 
freedom, it™s just that you™re aware of
 having freedom when you wake up now? 
A: Very much so, yes. I felt a [indecipherabl
e] of it after first day when the Americans 
came. It was the mo st exhilarating e
xperience you ever could have had. 

Q: And you couldn™t even get out of bed? 

A: Yes. I remember it so vividly. American
s came in [indecipherable]     Americans 
[indecipherable]. There was somebody who spoke
 Polish, he said, ﬁYou fellows just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
102
 
 
 
come and walk it off and come on out. We have some good food for you.ﬂ And a few 
came and a few of us just didn™t and he came 
to me, he said, ﬁOkay, come on, get off.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁI can™t move, I -- I can™t sit even
.ﬂ ﬁStand [indecipherable] up.ﬂ Said, ﬁOh my  
God, [indecipherable] that bad?ﬂ I said, ﬁOh, I™m not so great. I™m glad that you 

people came. I don™t feel so great.ﬂ So he 
pulled me off and he just [indecipherable] 
me like a baby. ﬁHow mu ch do you weigh?ﬂ ﬁHow do I know?ﬂ ﬁHow mu ch you 

normally weigh?ﬂ ﬁOh, about 150.ﬂ ﬁ[inde
cipherable], you weigh 50 pounds or less.ﬂ 
ﬁOh, no, I was [indecipherable].ﬂ So he 
took me directly to the [indecipherable] 
barrack [indecipherable] hospital and some people came and washed me. 

[indecipherable] me and gave me a [indeci
pherable] nightshirt. And I don™t know, for 
about two days I was oblivious. I don™
t know what happened. I -- I didn™t 
[indecipherable] dead, if I was sleeping, if -- 
if -- if whatever. I don™t think I ate for the 
first two days. And they came, three, four, 
five times a day with that little cup of -- 
kind of like a thin [indecipherable] soup. A
nd we drank and ate it. And with all the 
spam [indecipherable] 

Q: Okay, [indecipherable]

Beginning Tape Five, Side A   
Q: This is a continuation of a United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Stefan Czyzewski. Tape number fi
ve, side A. How did you obtain your U.S. 
citizenship? 
A: I applied for it. You -- you fill out citi 
-- certificate of intention or document of 
intention. So I filled it out almost immediately after I came here and three years later, I 

did get my citizenship. The place where I went
 to improve my English, which was the 
International Institute, had a special citizen
ship course, which I took and went through 

examination. And eventually the great day came. I was even the person who gave a 

speech. There was a group of about 120 peopl
e receiving it and I was asked to -- to 
give a talk. 

Q: Be -- You™ve been -- do you hold dual c
itizenship, are you allowed to? Or are you 
no longer a Polish citizen? 

A: As far as America -- as far as America 
is concerned, I have American citizenship 

and I had to forfeit any other. As far as 
Polish state is concerned, I have a dual 

citizenship. You cannot lo
se Polish citizenship. 
Q: And what about your contact over these 
years, as you got here, with your family? 
Were you writing letters to your family
? What were they saying about your 
experiences here? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
104
 
 
 
A: Yes, I corresponded with them from shortly
 before I left Germany, the mail started 
going through and I was told by one of my sist
ers, or written by one of my sisters that, 
ﬁIf you can, we would like very mu ch to 
see you. We would like to have you back, 
very much, but if you can, please don™t come
. Go elsewhere, because you will end in 
Piaskovo.ﬂ That two, three people out of 20 w
ho survived to the end, were sent to 
Siberia. 
Q: This is of your group? 

A: Of my  group, of my  fighting group, were se
nt to Siberia and of course, one of them 
came ba -- came back. Those two Jewish
 boys, Isaac number two and Isaac number 
one, did not come back. So then I stayed 
in Germany, recupera
ted, and did not go 
back.  

Q: Has there been a point over the years 
where you have considered returning to 
Poland? 

A: It never was. I have not even gone back
 for a visit. When the Communists ruled, I 
did not want to go back, because supposed ly I was being look -- looked for. And my 

friend and neighbor, who I mentioned previ
ously, whose name was Stefan Voiteewa, 
became prosecutor general of the Pol-Polish ar med forces and he arrested many of the 

people from my  part of Polish underground. And rumo r had it -- which is supposedly 

true, that he had [indecipherable] them -- ta
ken out and shot, without trial. There was a 
good encouragement of not going back.

Q: Do you know where he is now? 
A: He kicked the bucket a year ago. So if
 I ever go back to Poland, I™ll go and spit on 
his grave. Even though I kind of forgave hi
m for what he did, but he was an evil 
person and he was part of it. He had the same
 name as the present Pope and his mo ther 
and his family were chauvinistic Catholics.
 When the first of May came, the Socialist 
holiday, his mother would collect apron fu
ll of stones and he will -- she will go, oh 
like early in the mo rning, at three a.m. or 
so, to a house of one Socialist family in the 
village. She would go around and she would br
eak as many windows as she could. She 
was never caught, she was never punished, 
but everybody knew it was she who did it. 
And he, of course, didn™t want to jo
in the underground. He always was on a 
perryferry. As soon as the Soviets came, he
 joined. He fought in with the Polish 
Communist army, as far as Berlin. He was se
nt to be trained in Moscow and Ouro in 
Soviet Russia. He came back and was still in 
the Polish army and advanced as far -- in 
1975, he became a general and he became a prosecutor in the Polish army, prosecutor. 

Q: Does your family still own the house in Lesh -- 

A: Leshnagorra? 

Q: In Leshnagorra. 

A: No, they don™t. My sister Eleanor marri
ed a boy in next village, which she moved 
there and lived with him, his family. My 
sister Henreika lived in our house and had 
our farm. When she was ready to retire, she 
could either rent out the farm, which was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
106
 
 
 
impossible to survive on, or else she had to 
give it back to the government in lieu of a 
small pension. That™s what she did. She 
sold the house and the lot and the house was 
on, to a neighbor, for very little money -- 
neighbor who always helped her. And she 
moved to a nearby town and lived with he
r son on a -- on a pension. She lives there 
presently. So the farm was lost. And a fa
rm in Poland before the war, was like a 
sacrament, you never parted with it. That 
was your inheritance. You ne -- you --  piece 
of land you killed for. Presently things appa
rently changed, so the farm is gone. 
Q: Do you -- do you have any desire to go back? 
A: Slight desire. I intend to go someth -- 
somew -- sometime for a visit, but I™m still 
working full time, even though I am retired. I work only 43 hours a week and don™t 

really want to take a lot of time to go. As somebody said, you cannot come home 

again. And it would be kind of difficult to 
go home again. Especially all those people 
that I knew would be old, decrepit pe
ople and I™m the only one young among them. 
And all those pretty girls that I knew are ol
d decrepit women. One of them that I ran 
around with for quite some time, whose name was Helena, when I ask my  sister 

Eleanor how Helena is, she said, ﬁHelen
a is old and ugly a
nd she weighs 250 pounds. 
One of her legs is bigger than you are. Y
ou don™t want to see Helena.ﬂ And Helena 
was beautiful, plumped, little girl that I ha
d so much fun with. So how could I go and 
see Helena and enjoy seeing her when she is
 old and ugly and fat? She™s dead, by the 
way, she did not make it.

Q: Can you tell us about your job, the job that you eventually got and have had for 
quite a long time? 

A: Yes, the job I presently have, I had 
it for 46 years plus. It is a church goods 

comp any which has a large bookshop. And when
 I started working there, for about 
two or three years, I worked in a stoc
kroom, shifting stuff. Candles, wine, God knows 
what else. But I always wanted to work 
in the bookstore. Eventually I did and very 
soon after I started working here, the ma
nager died and his assistant became a 
manager. About two or three years later, the assistant mana -- the manager -- new 

manager, retired on disability and I became it. 
I been staying -- being it ever since.  
Q: And the name? 

A: I love books, I love reading. I like the 
people I work with. I really like the people 
that I serve. There™s a lot of r -- book readi
ng people that I serve and I still spend about 
eight or 10 hours a day reading. I take te
l -- a lot of telephone calls. We have a 
telephone system that covers the whole 
country. We have 800 number and a lot of 
calls come specially to me and I fli -- fiel
d mo st of the calls and transfer to somebody 
else if necessary. I buy a lot of books, I sell some books, and I read a lot -- I sit at my  

desk mo st of the day and read. And if my  
boss complains, I said, ﬁIf I stop reading, I 
am no good as a bookman any mo re, so you better let me be.ﬂ And he said -- he said, 

ﬁOf course I™ll let you be.ﬂ  

Q: When did you discover this passion for books? When did this emerge? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
108
 
 
 
A: Just about en -- when I was three. My
 mo ther was a frustrated schoolteacher, as I 
previously mentioned. She was fired when sh
e had her first baby. Back in Poland, if 
you had a baby, you were married, forget it. By time I was three, she taught me how to 
read and I have never stopped. 

Q: We had just talked a moment ago a
bout you becoming an American citizen. Why 

did you want to become one? 

A: The ideas of America -- the idea of Am
erican freedom, the idea of opportunity and 
freedom for all was extremely appealing to 
me. And of course, being a bug for history, 
I knew that two great Polish people came a
nd fought for America. And when I spent 

time fighting Nazis, I didn™t think that I wa
s fighting for my  own country only, but for 
everybody else who was subjugated by them, 
including the Americans, who fi -- who 
was fight -- who were fighting elsewhere.
 So, the idea of America was just a 
completely ideal place and ideology that appeal
ed greatly to me. May we shut it off for 
awhile? 

Q: I have to ask you this. Tell us 
about your wife, how you met her, where? 
A: Well, I had a friend who had a girlfrie
nd and the girlfriend knew Sylvia. And we 
went on a date one time and then we -- Sy
lvia read books and I read books. Sylvia 
played good mu sic and had a beautiful voice
 and I always appreciated mu sic and a 
good voice. And eventually she talked me in
to getting married. No, no, I talked her 
into getting -- into -- into marrying me. I 
wonder what she saw in me, but she got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
109
 
 
 
apparently infatuated and then st -- we stuc
k together forever and ever. She is the best 
girl I ever met. Course I wouldn™t dare to 
say anything else, seeing that she is here, but 
she really is. 

Q: When did you get married? 

A: I™m sorry? 

Q: When did you get married? 

A: In August, 1940 -- 1954. I was going to say ‚44.  

Q: And tell us about your son. 

A: While we wanted several children and we
 were told that you most likely will not 
have any. But eventually we had a son. He
 was the feeblest little thing you ever saw. 
He was premature. He was in isolette for se
veral weeks, being rocked back and forth, 
because -- to breathe, because his lungs were
 collapsed. And now he is big, he is 
heavy, he is fat and he™s a darn good mu sician. 

Q: His name? 

A: His name is Paul, of course. So, hi
s mu sical name is Paul Raymond, because 
nobody can pronounce Czyzewski. His middle name
 is Raymond and that was also his 
grandfather™s name. So, when he had a ba
nd, first band and a se
cond band and a third 
band, he always was Paul Raymond. 

Q: Have you told him about your experien
ces in the underground and in the war? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
110
 
 
 
A: Little. Little. He -- I don™t know, he may 
be slightly interested now, but he 
previously was not interested. And I never ma
de an effort to teach him Polish. When 
he was small, he knew few phrases in Polish,
 but since we speak only English at home, 
being th -- see, being that Sylvia is Yanke
e, we didn™t indulge mu ch in Polish and he 
did not learn it. Now, he is somewhat interest
ed. It was kind of interesting last year. He 
brought a form from Internal Revenue Servic
e. Did any -- did your parents or any of 
your relatives spend time in a war zone? 
So he was laughing it and I was laughing it 
and Paul -- they want me to fill it out. So he
 said, ﬁSure, if you were in war zone, fill it 
out.ﬂ And you know, if you were in American 
army , you were in a war zone for a few 
d -- five days, a week or two, then you were
 pulled back and you were put in again. So 
he said, ﬁWell, gee, how long were you in fo
rz -- in war zone?ﬂ I said, ﬁTwo and a half 
years.ﬂ ﬁTwo and a half years? Nobody could 
make it for two and a half years.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁWell, some of us did, some of us didn™
t.ﬂ So I wrote on that form, two and a half 
years in a war zone. And I wrote where, at 
that territory and then fighting whom and 
so on and so forth. And I send it back a
nd never heard from the -- from them again. 
Q: Did that spark his interest? 

A: Somewhat, yes. Occasionally, now, when I t-
talk about it, he -- he listens and when 
we did get those videos, he said, ﬁWell, ge
e, someday maybe I wi -- I should watch it, 
I should listen to it.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhy? You get bored to death.ﬂ

Q: Tell us a little bit about your work w
ith the Mung refugees. You, yourself, of 
course, were a refugee at one point. 
A: Yes. 

Q: A-And -- and you and your wife work with them. 

A: Well, I did very little of that work, be
cause I had a full time job at all times and 

doing something else. But Sylvia was working 
as an instructor in a program, English 

for foreign born. So she took her -- went
 to one parish and took individual Mung 
people and Indochinese people out of the 
classes and tutor -- tutored them. Yeah, 
Vietnamese refugees. And later on, we befriended -- 

Q: It was not Mung, it was Vietnamese? 

A: Vietnamese first. 

A2: It was the whole thing. 

Q: Okay, okay. 

A: First. And then Sylvia had quite a few 
Mung people that she tutored -- went to their 

homes and helped them. And from time to time, or quite a few times, we would invite 

group of Mung people to have picnic with us
 here. And it was kind of interesting. We 
invite 15 Mung people and maybe five or si
x would show up. But also, 47 may show 
up. So one time, we had invited about 15 
and I think we had about 40 - some. Kids 
running all over and they were so well behaved. I mean, you could -- I mean, 

neighbors didn™t comp lain, nobody di -- did anyt
hing. We had games and we had a lot 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
112
 
 
 
of food and the kids went in the backyard
 and watched the ducks
 and did all kind of 
things. And we still meet some of the -- t
hose Mungs. We are out of touch with them 
presently, but occasionally meet some of th
em, especially when we go to a vegetable 
market. There was a beautiful, little Mung girl 
that Sylvia was friends with her mother 
and her family. We see her occasionally se
lling vegetable and we say hello and chat. 
And then, just about every ti -- well, not ev
ery time, but when Sylvia went to tutor 
them, they would have some little thing-- little Mung thing made and there was an 
older man, whose name wa -- name was M-Mr. Washan. He said, ﬁSylvia, here™s a 

free gift for you.ﬂ So, she would get a little tr
inket or little embroidery square or one 
time she did get a large embroidery kind of a picture, made by -- as the Mung people 

mak e.  

Q: Did you sponsor a family? I don™t know if 
it was Mung or Vietnamese or Filipino? 
A: Yes, we -- my  -- our parish spons-spons
ored two Vietnamese boys about 20 years 
ago. And then when parish tried to dive
st them -- itself over -- [indecipherable] we 
took them in and they stayed with us fo
r some time. The young -- we found them jobs 
and the older one became independent qui
ckly and moved out. The younger one went 

to a local Catholic college and graduated. 
And he kind of stayed on and off with us, 
for about four or five years. Eventually
, he became independent. Three years? Okay, 
three years. Became independent, has a new jo
 -- great job, has a fat American wife 
and three kids. Has a big home and lives next
 door to us. His name is Vonsan and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
113
 
 
 
see him every day, we say  hello every day 
and we visit back and forth frequently. And 
later on, we sponsored two of his brothe
rs, who father sent out, they became boat 
people. Ended somewhere in Indonesia or 
somewhere and we sponsored those two. 
They came, stayed with us short time, but
 mo st of the time did not, because the -- 
Vonsan became independent, had an apartment. 
So we, of course, we visited a lot back 
and forth and those two boys are too marri
ed -- also married, have children and 
families and jobs. And we sometime visit 
with them, sometime see them. And there 
was a large group of Vietnamese boys who used to come to Milos or for a visit and 

they still occasionally come and see us. Even
 bring us little gifts, especially after 15 
years, just about every one gave him a clo 
-- I -- gave us a clock. I have several funny 

looking clocks around. Gar-Garis
h things with butterflies and -- and crazy things in 
them. Holy -- Holy statues in them. 

Q: Why was that important for you personally  to do, the sponsoring of the refugees? 

A: Well, I don™t know. Sylvia is very good 
person and she is very symp athetic to 
people. And seeing that I was a refugee at 
one time, we kind of 
did little sponsoring. 
And also, our parish -- our Catholic 
parish sponsored many, many Laotian, 
Vietnamese and Mung families. And for a 
long time, we were, and then I was on a 
committee that worked with th
em, finding them jobs and places to live and collecting 
clothing and -- and furniture and things. Pr
esently, we are not doing mu ch, or hardly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
114
 
 
 
any of it, because I™m old and Sylvia is 
catching up with me. I™m ancient and she -- 
she is getting old, too. She is not nearly
 as old as I am. Many, many years younger.  
Q: When you speak with Americans about the 
war, or the concentration camp s, or the 
Holocaust, what do you find? I mean, what 
do you find people know or think about it? 
A: Well, people find it unbelievable. People are,
 at times, shocked. But, mo stly, people 
that I talk to about it, is people that I go to
 give talk about it, like in school or college 
or -- or group of people that are interested
. So then, they ask many questions and I 
answer the questions and sometime elaborate,
 sometime I hard -- hide a lot of stuff, 

because they would be too shocking for pe
ople. And most American people, sus -- 
especially young people, are completely 
uninformed and know very little about it. 
Even adults did not know mu ch about it at th
at time, or did not pay attention toward 
the end of time, when the news drifted in 
here about the atrocities, about American 
army freeing a lot of dead people in a con
centratio -- in death camps. Many people did 
not batay -- pay attention to it.  

Q: Does it surprise you that people don™t know the history? 

A: No, it does not. Apparently schools don™t teach mu t -- mu ch about it. Also, I note it 

was the last two or three years, all of ca 
-- all of a sudden, just about every school had 
a -- a short course on the Holocaust and a 
short course on the second World War. And 
that™s mo stly the pla -- those other places that 
invite me to come and talk to them about 
it. So that is somewhat gratifying. But, 
for a long time, people were very uninformed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
115
 
 
 
about. Also, throughout all the time previous ly, and now, very well educated people, 
like for instance, college professors, tried to 
disprove that the Holocaust ever existed. 
There™s a group of professor that™s UCLA
, who are very vocal about it, telling 
everybody who wants to listen and everybody 
who doesn™t want to listen that 
Holocaust never existed, that was just a 
concoction made by certain groups of people, 
trying to influence us this way or that way. 

Q: And -- And how does that effect you? 

A: Well, if I had them nearby, I would feel
 like bashing their heads in, or telling them 
off and since I have never met one who w
ould voice that kind of opinion, I do feel 
upset. But we have people who are stupid,
 we have people who are prejudiced. We 
have pe-people who are hateful and also pe
ople who are uninformed or misinformed.  
Q: I guess this is my  last question, wh
ich is what do you think you carry with you 
from the experience, especially of resisti
ng and in the camp s? Ho-How did it shape 
you and the rest of your life? 

A: Well, I™m somewhat satisfied that what I 
did was not in vain. Also, I grieve greatly 

over those who -- who perished and I™m very 
grateful for having been able to survive 
and I frequently pray about it. And if it did 
me -- if it made me a better person or not, I 
don™t know. As I previously mentioned, I ha
ve never lost my  faith and in mo st 
circumstances, I am trying to be halfway good 
Christian. And at times I™m not satisfied 
with it, but I have to be. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0023
 
 
116
 
 
 
Q: Is there anything else you™d like to say? 
A: No, I think we talked blue streak, fo
rever and a day and I really don™t know what 
else I could add that would except -- I add to 
it, except that I™m rea
lly glad I survived. I 
am so grateful being able to live in a good, 
free country that with all it™s mishaps as -- 
and -- and thing that happen that are not gr
eat and not savory, still is a great, free 
country that lives up to it™s ideals. 

Q: Thank you very mu ch. 

A: You™re very welcome.
