W e have prepared a brief slide presen

m inute.
 
W ebegin with this portrait of  JosianeAizenberg walkin g ona street in Brussels. Josie was 
born March21, 1939 in Brussels, Belgium toJacques and Fanny Aizenberg. T he arrow on this map 

of  Belgium  points to Brussels.
 
T he Germ an Arm y conquered Belgium  in May 1940. Shortly before the 
occupation, Josie'sfather lef tBelgium to jointhe British Arm y. Inthis photo we see Josiewith her 

parents in Brussels.
 
In1942, Josie's mother, Fanny, was able to secure ahiding placef or Josie ina 
convent inBrugges, Belgium. Here we see Josie and Fanny, shortly before Josie went into hiding. 

Soon thereafter, Fanny, who worked with the
 
Belgian Underground,the resistance, was denounced 
and she was deportedto Auschwitz. Af ter six m onthsof  hiding in the conventand growin g Nazi 

suspicion, the Belgian Underground relocated Josie to hide with theDebrackalaers, a Christianfam ily 

in Brussels. Here we see Josie with the Debrackalaers. Mr.And Mrs. Debrackalaer are on the right. 

T o their left are neighbors of  Josie's grandparents.Their grandson is in thef ront, inthe m iddle, with 

Josie to the right.T heDebrackalaers' daughter is on the lef t.
 
Allied forces liberated Belgium  in 
September 1944. Soon af ter, Josie was found by one of her aunts. 
 
Her m other Fanny's sister.
 
Here we see Josie, Jacques,
 
and Fanny af terthey were reunited in 
B e lgiu m .
 
Josie would eventually m arry FreddieT raum , also a Holocaust survi vor. 
 
W eclose the slide presentation with their wedding portrait.
 
Af ter moving to the United States 
with her parents in 1949 and then com pleting her schooling in Patterson, New Jersey, Josie went to 

Israel to studyf ora year. Onthe returntrip on a ship shem et Freddie Traum, the ship's Chief  Radio

T eachers' Collegefor one year. Josie and Freddie were m arriedonhis ship a year af ter she met him , 

and shem ovedto Israel where they lived for f ive years.W hile in Israel, theT raum s' son Michael and 

daughter Yael were born.
 
Upon the advice of m edical experts in Israel, theT raum s relocated tothe 
United States in1963 to obtainm edical carefor their disabled son Michael.  Their third child, 

Jonathan, who also
 
isdisabled, was born in the US. Eventually, Fr eddie's work brought them to

Josie, thank you som uch for joining us andbeing wi lling to be our 
F i rs t  P e rs o n
 
today. Thank you. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  I'm  delighted. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You have so much to sharewith us in a short period, so we'll start. Yourparents, 

Fanny and JacquesAizenberg, were m arried in early 1938. You were born in 1939,m onths before 

Germ any and Russia invaded Poland beginningW orldW ar II. Before we turn to the war, tell us a little 

about your parentsand their lif e in Brussels,Belgium  in those prewar ti
m e s.  
 
>> Josie T raum :  As you m entioned,m y parents were m arried in 1938,and a year later I was born. 

T hey hada pretty norm al lif e.T hey were both in the garment and clothing industry, andthey li ved 

pretty normal lives, until the Nazis m arched in and took over Belgium. Your m other was in the 

garm ent industry, but it was m ore than that.Tell us about your m other Fanny. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  My m other as a young girl went to a textile school design and she woulddraw and 

m ake patterns and new clothes. At theendwhen she graduated, thefam ily sent some people tothe 

school to pickout a few to work f or the Royal Household. Sure enough, she was picked and worked 

for the royal, the king and queen of Belgium  as a dressmaker anddesigner for a little while before
 

she gotm arried. Shewas pretty proud of that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hadto bea huge honor. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Oh, it was. It was a pretty big deal. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather,hedidnot startoff  inthe garm ent business. Youhave to share that. 
 
>>
 
Josie T raum :  OK.My dad was a violinist, I know you can't im agine there,but there used tobe 
silent movies. 
 

[Laughter]
 
W ay, way bef ore your tim e. Movies were nottalkies. So they would have a little quartet playing m usic 

while the movie, while the f ilm
 
was showing. Som y dad did that. He played the violin. Thetalkies 
cam e in,and he losthis job.T here was noneedfor musicians indifferent cinemas.They didn't need 

it. Sohe went to school to becom ea tailor. He became a tailor,andactually had, once
 
m y parents 
were m arried he had a store which was actually at the bottom of  ourapartment building, and in those 

days you didn't just walk into Bloom ingdalesor Macy's and get a suit. You would go toa tailor. You 

would pick outthe material. My dad used to have bolts andbolts of differentm aterials. A person 

would pick outthe material, thenm y dad would actually m akea pattern out of paper.Theperson 

whose suit was beingm ade would com e tom y dadevery week or quite afew m onths. 
 
Som y dad would get to know the person. Itwasn't just a suit. Youknow, you talk tothem , you made 

the suit, so it was ver y, ver y interesting. Sothey were m orethan really clothes m akers.

>> Bill Benson: W henthey m arried in 1938,Nazi power had really com e into itsf ullb
lo om,  if  yo u  will,  
since 1933. Inf act, in1938, the latter part ofthe year, was Kristallnacht, the Night of  Broken Glass. 

T hef ollowing year, they would invade Poland. You were born in 1939. Do you know if  when you were 

born inthe year the war began and
 
Naziism  and Hitler inpower, if  your parents,do you know if  they 
felt worried about the futureat thattime, bringing you into their lives? W as it a scary tim efor them ? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Idon't know if they realized it when they got m arried, and theGe
rmans had not 

invaded Belgium  yet. In f act, they invaded Belgium  May 10, 1940, invaded f our countries in one day: 

Holland, France,Belgium  and Luxembourg. T hose countries really didn't stand a chance.T hey 

im me d ia te ly f e ll.  
 
So Idon't know if  m y parents before that, if  they were worr ied, but Iknow thatm y parentswould listen 

to the radio andhear calls from Britain to askfor volunteersto join the British Arm y tof ightagainst 

Germ any. T hat's when m y dad actually decided to go to England tof ight. 
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  Before you tell usm ore about that, one,I want to ask you how you got your name 
Josiane. 
 
>> Josie T raum : T here's a very f am ous French singer, hernam e was Josiane, which is whatm y 

m om  callsm e, and she nam edm eaf ter her.I never met another Josiane.I becam ea Josie or 

Josiane in this country, becausenobody could really say Josiane. My m om is theonly onewho calls 

m e Josiane. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  She def initely does. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Shedoes, absolutely. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Kristallnacht, which of  course happenedbefore your birth, November 9, 10, 1938, it 

did have a directeffect on yourf am ily, though. I think they sheltered a young Jewish child.Say a little 

about that. 
 
>> Josie T raum : They did.They sheltered ayoung Jewish girl that had run away f rom  one of the 

other countries. Idon'teven recall which one.As am atter off act, we sheltered quiteaf ew young 

Jewish people who were running away whenthe Germanshadalready invade, in Poland,Rom ania. 

Jews were f leeingf rom there.We would have people sleep overf ill they f ound a saf er
 
--
 
till they found 
a safer place. 
 
Kristallnachtdidnot really im pact Belgium . Ithink people were ver y worried. My dad listened to the 

radio, really wanted to get to England to be able to join theArm y. Also, it was thought inBelgium  

when theGermans would invade they would leave the wom enand children alone and only arrest and 

deport them en. So I think m y dad didn't worr y to the same extent asfar as leaving us. He and his 

brother indeed tookone of 
t h e l
ast ships to cross the English C
hannel in 1940 to get to England. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas ri ght bef ore the invasion of  Belgium . 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes.Baseline and theother so
-
called lowlands, France, The Netherlands. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Exactly. 
 
>
> Bill Benson:  He and his brothertookthe last ship, made it to England? 
 
>> Josie T raum : T hey m ade ittoEngland. My dad was a tailor. Hisbrother was alsoa tailor. They 

got to England,England wondered what they coulddo with these two guys. T hey put
 
t hem  i n  a  
factory m aking British unif orm s.T hat was
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson: T heir experience. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Probably the safestplacefor them  to be. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e'll hear later not entirely saf efor sure. Now thatyour f ather is gone, it's your 

m
other and you. Did your mother know oncehe said goodbye to her, thinking that you would be safe, 
of  course, as you explained, did she know whathappenedtohim ? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  No.There was no communication. It was im possible.

>> Bill Benson:  Because
 
war was on. 
 
>> Josie T raum : W arwas on. Infact, the ships crossing the channel were being torpedoed by the 
Germ ans. He, I think,m ade itacross the channelon oneof  the lastships thatactually cros sed 

without being sunk. But m y motherhad no idea 
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  He could have been sunkf or all she knew? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Shedidn't know. 
 

>> Bill Benson: W hatdid your m otherdonow? She's alone.She doesn't know what's happenedto 

her husband. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Andm e. W e livedactually i n an attic
 
apartm ent of  the apartm ent building where we 
lived. M y grandparents, maternal grandparents lived with us,m y m om 'sm om anddad.W e lived 

togetherpretty m uch to ourselves. My m other was part of  theunderground. As Im entioned before, 

she was hiding Jewish
 
people till they could f ind a safer place to live or tobe, suchas Spain or 
Swit zerland, wherever perhaps countries were more neutraland letting Jewish people in. So we 

alwa ys had people sleeping over. 
 

My m om  kind of had anetwork in the underground. She was working with the underground. She was 

helping them and shem ade sure she wanted m e tobe saf e. So one day, 1942,3 years old, two 

strange ladies cam e to pick me up and to take me away. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Before we go on aboutthat, Josie, a couplemore questions, because before she did 

that it was the two of you for two full years. 
 

>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Living under Germanoccupation. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson: Whatwas that time likefor her? How was she ableto m ake
 
endsm eet? Do you have 
any idea? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  She would get food rations. Belgianf ood was really rationed.There wasver y little to 

be gotten.W e justm anaged, with very, ver y l ittle. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had toldm e that even access tohealthcare,
 
yo u ' re  a  lit t le girl,  wa s  ve r y d if f ic u lt .  
 
>> Josie T raum : W ell, there was none.T here was none whatsoever. So I wasn'texactly a newborn. I 

was up to theage of 3, butthere was really no healthcare or anything else. That's why whe n people 

ask me today if I hadany ofthe childhood illnesses, likem easles, chicken pox, I really don't know, 

becausem y m om , I wasn't always with her,andI was separatedf rom her. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e Jewish m otherswere specif ically forbidden f rom going to
 
--
  
>> J
osie T raum : T othe clinics. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  If  you were sick or needed im munization, you could not go? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Right. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Foodwas rationed. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  It was hard. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  She was not able to earn a living at that point? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  No.Not atall. So she did get
 
--
 
she was able, she m ade a decision to put me in 
hiding. I think to m yself that must have been such a diff icult thingf or her, you know, being a parent 

now and a grandparent, I can't im agine giving upm y 3

year
-
old. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T o goto someabsolute unknown. 
 

>> Josie T raum :  Shehad no idea whereI was going. She wasn't allowed to know. I thinkhow brave 

it was f or her to do that. These two ladies came topick me up,and they put me ina convent in 

Bruges, which is a beautif ul little city in Belgium  on the eastern coast
 
--
 
excuse m e, western coast, by 
theocean.T hey tookm e. By the way, m y m om  was not allowed toknow where they were taking m e.

Because they knew wh en the Germans would come andperhaps arrest you, they would ask,W here 
is the rest of  yourfam ily? Where is your husband?W hereare your children?They decidedtheonly 

wa y was thatparentswere not allowed to know where they were taking their children. So I was taken 

away, and m y m om  really didn't know if  shewould ever see me again. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you have any idea,do you know wh y or if  therewas a precipitating event that was 

enoughf or her todo what you just said, thisprofound act of devotion to put you intohiding?W ha
t 
was the deciding event for that? 
 
>> Josie T raum : W ell, in 1942, that's when the Nazis really starteddeporting Jews. All the Jews 

deportedf rom Belgium actually were takentoAuschwitz, which is one of the most infam ous camps in 

Poland. 
 
So I was takenaway, and I was put in a saf e place. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wantto ask youone more question before youtellus what you can about lif e in the 

convent. Youtoldm e about, because you were so young you don'thave personal memories of  a lot 

of  it but youhave af leeting m em ory of  some things with your m other, including riding on a bus are 

her. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  You rem ember that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ido rem em ber that. Probably because youdid. 
 
>>
 
Josie T raum :  I know. In Belgium  oranywhere that was runby the Germ ans, by the Nazis when 
they invaded, youhadto have an identity card. In the identity card it said if you were Jewish or not. 

T here was a large J if you were Jewish. So you hadto go everywhere and carry that identity card with 

you. Oneday m y m om and I were, I was 3 years old,before I was put into hiding,m y m om and I were 

riding a trolley. T hey didn't have buses in Belgium .T hey had trolleys, you know, electric wi res. 
 
W e sat in the 
back row, m y m om and I. And while we were sitting in the back row on this trolley a 
Nazi off icer cam e on the trolley, and he was going f rom  row to row to row, asking f orpeople's identity. 

Identity card. He went from  row to row, and my m other was shaking. 
Of co u rse, Id id n 't kn ow wh y. I 
couldn't understand why. 
 

He got toevery ro w, and got to the last row, andfor som e reason turnedaroundand walked out.So 

som ebody m usthavebeen watching over my m om and I,butthatwas a pretty close call. 
 

>> B ill B e n
son:  Surewas. During that time,Josie, where were your grandparents?W hatwas going 
on for them? 
 

>> Josie T raum :  My grandf ather worked in synagogue. My grandmother worked in Jewish and 

Hebrew, which is f or the society, making surethatthe right burial
 
things were done to a Jewi sh 
person whodied, making sure watching thebody, washing the body, m aking sure everything was in 

order. She workedfor this society. My grandm a and grandpa were very in volved in the Jewish 

organization. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywere able to continue that for a while? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Until they were deported. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Maybe you'll tell usm oreabout that in a bit. Here you are now, two people have 

com e and taken you. Your mother does not know where, and youend up inthi
s  c on  ve n t . W hat do 
you know about what that was likef or you? I think you were therefor
 
--
  
>> Josie T raum :  Six m onths.I was in the conventf or six m onths. Iwant you to realize when people 

were hiding Jews in Belgium , and I'm  suremany other countries
 
in Europe, is they were taking great 
risks. If a Germ an would know onthe street that you arehiding a Jew, they would shoot you. No 

questions asked. 
 
So I'm  thinking the nuns, when I got therethey were ver y, ver y strict. Have you seen"T he sound of 

m us
ic"?T he nuns with the very, ver y heavy starched garb. No wonder they were strict.

[Laughter]However, they were still nuns.They saved m e.T hey hidm e, and they saved me. Ifound 
outaf terthe war there were three other Jewish children being hidden there,meand the three others. 
 
T he convent was full of kids. Apparently, it wa s like anorphanage. In wartime there was nofood. 

People who couldn't take careof  their kids would put them  inanorphanagefor a little while until they 

would be able tom anage. It was wartim e; there was nofood. So kids were ver y often left there quite 

a period of time. 
 
W ithall of  kids I was very young. If  Im entionthenuns were ver y, very strict. Not because Iwas 

Je wish .   

>> Bill Benson: T heywere just strict. 
 

>> J o s i e  T r a
um : T oall of  the kids, they really were. I was 3 years old. I think all I wanted was to be 
heldandhugged and kissed and, you know, told everything would be OK. And oneday the nuns 

found out that the Germ ans were going to pick up thefour Jewish children.So by night they 

sm uggled me out of the convent, me andthethreeother Jewish children,and tookm e back to 

Brussels, where I wasborn, and they placedm e with a Christianf am ily. You sat the pictures.T heir 

name was Debrackelaer. I stayed with them actually for the entire durationof  the war, till Belgium  was 

liberated in 1944. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Josie,I think while you were in the convent your nam e was changed.W hat was it 

changedto, and therewas som e signif icance to that if I rem em ber right. 
 

>> J
osie T raum :  Yes,there was. My name Aizenberg was a ver y Je wish nam e, so they changedm y 
name to a very Flem ish sounding Dutch name like Van
 
Berg. My nam e was changed. My f irst nam e 
rem ained the sam e. It was Josiane Van
 
Berg.W hich was m ore than acceptabl
e Dutchname, Flem ish 
name. 
 
In Belgium  you speakFlem ishand French. In fact, when you go to school you learn both languages. I 

did not rem em ber m y Flem ishat all onceI left Belgium . I stayed in convent until I went with this 

fam ily, the Debrackelaers. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you have any knowledge of  how, once thenunsthought there was danger f or you 

andarrangedfor you to leave, do you have any idea how that was arranged? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  No. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You show up at the Debrackelaers' home? 
 
>
> Josie T raum :  Right, I just showed up there, and they were kindenough totakeme in.I stayed 
with them  f rom  1942
-
44 .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  A long tim e. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  A long tim e.T hey hada little girl m y age, and it was ahusband, a wife,a mother, 

fa
ther, little girl. T he father was ver y in volved i n the underground.T hey were Christian people, but he 
was ver y invol ved doing things against the Germ ans, andhe was often taken into interrogationf rom  

theapartm ent we were livin g in. I remember him  com ing
 
back, they used to interrogate him ,they 
m usthave beatenhim , becauseheused tobe blackand blue. Buthe never told on me, and they 

never really
 
--
 
they used totorture him, but he never toldonm eor anything else that was going on 
thathe was doing. 
 

T he Debrackelaers, not only did they hidem e and protectm e, butf ood was rationedbefore, and here 

there were three people. T heirnam es were on the list to getf ood. My name was not. I wasthere 

illegall y, because I was being hidden there. So they would
 
pick upfood oncea week for three people, 
andthey would share it with m e.Sonotonly did they save m y lif e,but they risked their lives and they 

saved m e.

>> Josie T raum :  Shewas denounced. People were wonderful in Belgium . There were som any 

people who risked their li ves to save Jews, but there were alsom any people who denounced Jews 

and got moneyf or telling the Nazis where the Jews were living. So one of our neighbors denounced 

m y m other, and we know it's the neighbor becauseaf ter the war we found that he was using our 

silver wa re andour dishes. So we knew people believed otherpeople. Sometimesf or just a bit of 

m oney. 
 
Som y m other was arrested. T hey didhit her, tortureher,but she couldn't say where it was. She 

couldn't say where any of us were. 
 

T hey were deported and they were takenby cattle car toAuschwitz.  Bef ore that,they actually were in 

a transit cam pforf ive, six days, called Malini. From  there they actually went in the cattle ca

resistance? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Idon't know that. Idon't know. Ma ybe they did. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You don't know that that was a reasonfor her being denounced?

>> Josie T raum :  Right. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Go ahead, I'm sorry, Josie. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  No,I'm  just saying the cattle cars, Idon't know if you've been through them useum  

yet, buton the second f loor
 
--
 
excuse me, thethirdf loor, there's a cattle car where they actually 
transported Jews. T hey would f ill up the cattle cars and transport the Jews to take them  to the 

concentration cam p. In each cattle car therewere about100
-
150 prisoners.T hey couldn'tsit or lay 
down; they could just stand.T here was nofoodf or theduration of the time, however m any days they 

would bef rom  the country they cam ef rom tothe concentration camp. 
 
N o w,  t
here's nof ood or water. By the time they got to Auschwit z, som eof  thepeople on the cattle car 
were already dead. My grandf ather died on acattle car. He never actually made it to Auschwit z. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did your other grandparentsm ake it to Auschw
i t z?  
 
>> Josie T raum :  My grandmother made it toAuschwitz. She got offthe train andas soonas you got 

off  the train, you know, m ost concentration cam ps were killing centers. You got there,theykilled you 

im mediately. Auschwitz had a subcam p, a labor cam p calledBirkenau,and so when you got off the 

train there was a selection.T he Germ an guards wouldf orm two lines: One line with the young people 

who could work, and the other line with the elderly or people, children who theyf elt couldn't work. So

they
 
m ade two lines, and by the way, m y m om  was putonone lineandm y grandmother on another 
line, because she was elderly. Shem ust have been inher 50s. Andm y m other went to bewith her 
m other,by the way, becausethey were separated imm ediately. TheGerm ans swatted herand said, 

You go where you're told. Sheactually never  saw her m otheragain. 
 

I thinkm y grandmother was killed pretty soonaf ter she got to Auschwit z. And m y m other went to the 

factory where they m ade amm unition.They used theprisoners to
 
f ill bom bs and grenades with 
chem icals. So m y mom  would go to thef actory ever y sin gle day.

Josie T raum :  No.Really, when I was put in hiding, when I was 3 years old, I didn't even know 
what a Jew was. So I really didn't know.W hile I was in convent, all the kids in there were saying 

rosaries.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas part of  trying to protect you. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Right. I was doing what they were doing. Theonly thing diff erent, the rosaries were 

in French. I was really protectedby m any, many people. I was very, ver y lucky.

W hat happened wasm y m om  rem ained in Auschwitz till liberation.

>> Josie T raum :  April 1945.T he arm ies invadeddiff erent concentration camps and Auschwit z was 

liberated by the Russians. She was actually
 
taken outof  Auschwitz by the Nazis and put,placed in 
thedeathm arch. Once the Germans realized thatthe Allies were approaching, they emptied som eof  

their concentration cam psand triedto takethe prisoners back towards Germany. 
 
Som y m om  was taken outona deathm archf rom  January 1945till she was liberated by the Soviets, 

by the Russians, inApril 1945. 
 
She was taken to hospital, because she was a pretty sick person.She hadmeningitis, typhus and 

wei ghed about 65 pounds. She was takentothe Red Cross, taken to ahospital, andeventually was 

brought back by the Red Cross to Belgium .Thef irst place she wentwas to her sister's house. She 

knocked on the door,and there I was. So wewere reunited. How f ortunate.

T old you about it, yes. 
 
[Laughter]

>> Bill Benson:  And joins us here at 
First  P e rso n
. Yeah. Do youhave any insight asto what it was 
like for you? Youhadn't seen her since you were very, ver y young. You'd beenthroughdifferent living 

environm ents, different families, different settings. Now this senseof fam ily with your auntsand your
 
cousins. You've been there for months now when yourm other arrives.W hat was that transition like? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Idon't remember very m uch of  it,and m y mother tells m e it was joyous and happy, 

andI believe her. And you know, of  course, itm usthave
 
been wonderful to seeher. 
 
I know you're going to want me to tell the story. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course I am . 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Josie T raum :  Bill knows ever ything. 
 

[Laughter]
 
My m other tellsm e, becausethere arethingsI don't rem em ber, becauseI was so young, andm y 

m other tells m e whenwe were f irst reunited I would tie m y nightgown tohers,becauseI was af raid 

she'd leave. I was af raid to leave her. Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson: Whenyour m other tells us that, she reacts exactly the same way. 
 
>> J o s i e  T r
au m :  I  kn ow.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yeah. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  I know. It was wonderful being reunited. My dadeventually cam e backalso. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Again, another shock. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yeah. He cameback in 1946, which was the yearaf ter the war, and a
pparently 
while he was li ving in London hishouse was bom bed, and he spent two years in a hospital.But 

eventually he did com e back. He was pretty cut upf rom  the topto the bottom,to his legs. 
 

He came back,and we were reunited, which was diff icult, because the three of  us had gone through 

totally different experiences. And so it was wonderf ultobe together again, but it was hard.My 

parents decided that they really would not beable to
 
--
 
they didn't want to stay in Europe anym ore, 
because after every
thi ng thatthey had gone through. So they m adeoutpapers and requests and 
visas to come to the United States. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we talk a littleabout that, Josie, when yourf ather cam e back you were of

>> Josie T raum :  
Ye s .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you remember his return?

know right af ter the war?W as it aperiod of tim e? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Shedid know ri ght af ter the war, because thenh

letters. Once she came backf rom  Auschwitz, that's when they started corresponding.

establish her life asbest she could, then what 
did they do togetheronce he was back?W hat did your mom do? 
 
>>
 
Josie T raum :  My m other relied a lot on her sisters.W e were kind of  part of thefam ily, but we also 
m oved into theattic apartm ent where we used to live. So m y mom really tried to get work again. I 

started going to school, because I was 6 years old. I didn't have school bef orebecause I was too 

young. My m other was working in dress m aking. Littleby little, we became a unit, afam ily again. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you say, they made the decision, they really wanted anew start, and they were 

going to leave E
urope. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ittook a while for that to happen. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hat led up to theirf inally being able to leave? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  First, there were waiting lists and quotas. You couldn't just com eto the United 

States. It took years tobe able to be accepted for visa andtobeable to come here. And you had to 

have sponsors to make sure that you'd be able to work and supportyourself  when you came here. 
 
Som y m om  did have a sponsor. Shehadan
 
elderly aunt living in New
 Je rse y.   
>> Bill Benson: W hohad come beforethe war? 
 

>> Josie T raum :  No,no, way, way bef orethe war. So m y parents and I lived with my m om's auntf or 

about a month, till both m y parentsf ound work in the garm ent industry, and we f ound an apartm ent 

and just started living. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Ihave to believe thatf orall of  you, you, of course, but your mother andf ather, the 

transitionf rom the horrors they had been through, each different asyou described, the afterm ath of  

the war in Europe, pickup,arrive in the United States, thetransitionm ust have been a challengef or

>> Josie T raum :  It was ver y, ver y diff icult. Itwas hard. Mentally and physically. She usedto have 

nightm ares nightly. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You rem em ber those? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  I remem ber those, becauseI remember her running through the apartm ent and 

scream ing. Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  For you too, it was hard.W hen you arrived and youwere put into school, because 

now you' ve got to go to Am erican school. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Right. I didn't know one word of English. I was 10years old.They put me inf irst 

grade. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because of English?

>> Josie T raum :  Right. I stayedthere about two weeks. Then they putm e in second grade. Thenfor 
an
other week or two, then I was put in third grade.Eventually, I caught up with the kids.I don't really 

rem em ber ever not speaking English. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You learn quickly. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  I learned very quickl y. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou first arrived and went to school, you hada really tough experience. You 

were beat up by som egirls. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yeah. Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other jum ped in on that, as I recall.

Josie T raum : W ell, the f irst day com ing out of school, there was a gang of  girls waiting for me, 
andthey beatm eup. Ididn't know wh y. I couldn't talk. I couldn't def end myself . Really, there were too 

m any of  them . 
 

So I got hom e. I was pretty bruised. Andm y m om  went to school the next day to speak tothe 

principal.W hatever English she knew. I don'tknow how she did it.The principal said thatfor some 

reasonthe girls who ganged up againstm e,they all thought I was Germ an. 
 
I don't think that would have m ade really any difference. For some reason, I was different, and she 

decided to gang uponm e. It never happened again. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Last time? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your aunts,did they rem ain in Belgium?

Yo r k .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were able to see them? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Oh, yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  For the entire
 
--
 
for your m om ,her sisters and your dad, how did they doaf ter that? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Ithink eventually they assim ilated. My parents wanted very m uch to becom e 

Am ericans. So when Icam e hom ef rom  school every day they didn't want m eto speak French with 

them . W e spok
e English.T hey learned all thePresidents, the capitals, you know, everything that in 
those days you had tolearn all thattobecome an Am erican citizen. 
 
T hey attended a special high school atnightso they would learn everything. For them , I see they 

s
lowl y becam eassim ilated and acculturated.Life went on. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us aboutm eeting Freddie. 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Ah.That was a very good part. 
 
[Laughter]
 
I went to study in Israel for a year,and on thewa y back, this was in the late 1950s, in
 
those days we 
really didn't travel by plane. It was really expensive. So I traveled ona ship, and Freddie,my 

husband, was the chief radio officer,and wem et, and we danced, and we were married ayear later.

has to share with us.The sam e is true whenFanny is with us. Thefact that the t

>> Josie T raum :  Yes. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T o what extent do you thinkwhat you went through had any bearing on your choice 
of  a career to work wit h abused children? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Ithink everything. Som ehow I was pulled to thatprofession, and Ialways  wanted to 

work with children toprotectthem ,tom ake sure that they're safe and protectedand all right. 
 

I  re a lly
 
--
 
you know, my f eeling always in children growing up, If eelthatI was very, ver y f ortunate and 
ver y, very luck y. M y f irst three years of  lif e I had nurturing, love aroundme. My grandmother, m y 

grandfather andm y mom . My f eeling,having studied childdevelopm ent, it is so important thef irst 

three years of lif e to be nurtured andtaken care of . Not necessarily by a parent, by a caretaker who is 

alwa ys there and the child knows wil l alwa ys be there. 
 
So IthinkI was fortunate enoughto have that, for m yfirst three years of life, and I think it's so crucial 

and im portant. 
 
I was drawn to socialwork. I really was. I've alwa ys wanted to work with children, to protect them , to 

keep them  saf e, and I did f or 20 years. 
 

>>
 
Bill Benson:  Josie,I think we have tim efor questionsf rom our audience. If you're willin g, let's see 
who has questionsf oryou today. 
 
If you have a question, I ask youm ake it as brief as you can.W ehave m icrophonesoneither sidesof  

the aisle. Ple
ase wait till them icrophone is inyour hand.T hen I'll probably try m y best to repeat the 
question, just to make sure everybody, including Josie, hears the question. 
 
Do we have anybody out there who's got a question?W hoare thebrave alwa ys to start us
 
of f ?
 
>> As there isanti
-
Sem itism  in Europe, do you think therem ight be another genocide thatwi ll 
happen? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Idon't know if  you
 
--
 
>> Josie T raum :  Idid hear. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  OK. 
 
>> Josie T raum : T hat's a very good question, and Ifear what's going on in Europe and watching 

what's happening.T here is a possibility, unf ortunately. If ear it very, ver y m uch. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you. Do we have another question?T here we go, in theback. 
 
>>W hen you relocated back to your originalhome, were the neighbors that denounced you still 

there,and was thereany sort of  acknowledgm ent of what they haddone? 
 
>> Bill Benson: T he question is when you wentback to your hom ewith your mother, were the 

neighbors still there,and if  they were was there any acknowledgm ent of what they haddone? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  Asfar as I know, I don't think they were ever approached or conf ronted, but all I 

know is thatm y m om  knew thatall her stuff  was being usedthere intheapartment. 
 
I don't think the governm ent did anything. Idon't think really anything was done. But there were many 

collaborators, people who helped the Nazis. T here were m any people who helped Jews, butby the 

sam e token there were m any people who didnot. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Might takean
 
opportunity just tom ention there's a very special exhibit called "Som e 
were neighbors"  that is a special exhibit, Ithink for another year or so, right outside these doors to 

your right. It's really particularly in li ght of  what Josie shared with us, might be one that youwant to go 

to . 
 
A question right here. One there, thenback to you. >> Josie, thankyou ver y m uchfor sharing your 

story.W hat gives you your inner strength, do you
 
think? How would you gi ve advice to children these 
days based on that?

well, the inner strength that I have I think isdoing what isbest with 
what you have, and trying to see the positive in whatever you have.Alsofinding a good partner and 
m ate is also very, ver y helpful. It has been for m e. 
 

I don't know really wha t else gives m e the inner strength.I think havi ng survi ved and wanting to

did youf ind out, did your parents talk aboutthe war, because you were so young? Did youeven know 

what was going on, and didthey talkabout their experiences? 
 
>> Bill Benson: T he question is when did youf ind out really what your parents went through, and did 

they af terthe war talkabout what they went through? 
 
>> Josie T raum :  I really startedf inding out what happened when Iwas a teenager, af ter Ihadbeen 

here inthe country f ora little while, and I started reading and hearing. M y parentsdidn't

we ll,  m y 
parents talked about whathappenedto them . My m om  didn'ttalk too much. In fact, shedidn't really 

st
art talking till the age of 50. But I started reading m ore andm ore.Also, once I retiredf rom social 
work, I started volunteering at them useum. It just was a naturalplacefor metobe.So I had read a

ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD

>> Josie T raum :  OK.W hen I speak to groups of  people,especially to young people, I liketo read a 
particular quotef rom  the m useum, because to me it's so meaningful. I don't know if I any of you have 

gone
 
through them useum yet, but as you leave the secondf loor, the whole war, there'sa quote and I 
want to read it to you. It'sf rom am an namedMartin, he wrote something ver y, ver y wise. Letm e read 

it to you: First they cam efor the socialists. Idid not speakoutbecause I was not a socialist.T hen 

they camef orthe trade Unionists. Idid not speakout because I was nota trade Unionist.T hen they 

cam ef or the Jews. I did not speakoutbecause I was not a Jew. T hen they came f orm e.T here was 

no one left to speakfor me. 
 
T o me thisembodieswhat them useum  is all about. You have to speak outfor yourf ellow human 

being. Som ebody asked about genocide in Europe, is there apossibility. Yes, there is. Noone is 

speaking out. Nobody is saying anything. I think it has to be done. You, especially the young people, 

you're the generation of thef uture. You couldreally m ake adiff erence. W hen you see injustice or 

som ething not nice being done to som eoneelse, you must speak out. 
 
[Applause]
