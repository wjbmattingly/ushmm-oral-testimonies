Eva Brettler. 
This is 
Stephanie Blyskal
. It is November 9

Alexandria, Virgin ia.
 Good afternoon. 
Answer: Good afternoon. 

Q: Why don™t you start by 
telling me where you were bo
rn, when  you were born 
and what your name
 was at birth. 
A: Okay . I was born in Œ on Novemb er 29
th
, 1936, in 
Cluj, Kolozsvár, 
or 
Kla u senburg
, depending. 
Klausenburg
 is the Yiddish  word , but depending who 
was in power, the name was different. My Œ 
Q: And who was in power when  you were born? 
A: Actually, I believe it was
 Hungaria
. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And Œ no, it was
 Romania
, because as a little girl
 I remember 
standing and 
greeting the Hungarian  soldie
rs coming into
 to wn , ok ay . 
Q: Okay . 

A: So it was 
Romania,
 then it became 
Hungary
. But as I recall, I spoke most of my 
life, as a young child, only Hungarian, I don™t reme mb er speaking Ro manian. 

Q: Mm-hm.

A: My father Œ my maiden name is 
Eva Katz
. My father was one of 10 children, 
and my  mother Œ his name is
 Aleksander
(ph)
 Katz, 
or
 Alexander Katz, 
depending 
where Œ you know, what paper it appe
ars. And my mother™s name is 
Margit Katz
, 
her maiden name is
 Roth, r-o-t-h
, and she was one of six children. I believe both of 
them were the second childre
n in the family. My father
 became a printer, and my  
mo ther was a hat maker, and I love beautiful
 hats. I remember we lived in a very 
nice apartment, it was a multip
le unit apartment. And I 
have some memories of 
being in
 Ko lozsvár
. I never called it
 Cluj
 til later. And I had a vivid, active life. I 
reme mb er being spoiled. 
Q: Were you Œ were
 you an only child? 
A: I was the only child. My Œ I remember 
once I was being punished  because early 
age on I was kind of looking around and I ended up in  a Christian church , a big 

Catholic church. There was music coming 
out of it and I went in an d my  poor 
mo ther was looking for me. And I ended 
up being punished, and my  punishment 
was that my father took aw
ay my  shoes, and my  mo ther
 had to carry me. And I was 
a little Œ kind of bad, so I said, this is re
ally no punishment. I loved being carried by 
my mother, so my father got pretty angry 
[indecipherable]
. So early age on I had a 
certain amount of independent spirit. A
nd we moved, I think my  parents moved 
there when they got 
married, so they didn™t have 
as many friends. And I remember

my mother kind of talking to me alwa
ys about what was going on. I was her little 
confid ant, which continued. Un fortunately, 
she died at age 28, so it was to Œ for a 
very short time. 
Q: Was your Œ was your Œ I™m sorry to interrupt, was your Œ were you in a li Œ 
religious family? 

A: Both my father and moth
er came from very religious family, but I believe when 
they moved up to 
Cluj
, some of the religion was left 
a little behind. And my father 
enjoyed playing cards, and I rememb
er that causing so me problem.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: He played chess and cards, and it wasn
™t so meth in g  wh at my  mo th er was used  
to, so as a young girl I re member arguments about that. 

Q: Did you keep kosher til your move? 

A: We always kept kosher, 
yes. And I don™t recall my Œ I didn™t recall that my 
mo ther was work ing, but my  aunt, who surviv
ed, her aunt Œ my aunt is my father™s 
younger sister, her name is 
Ibby
(ph) 
Steinberger
(ph) now. She remembers that 
when  I was a baby, she came over to watch 
me wh ile my  mo th er 
went to work. But 
for some reason, I had no recollection of th
at. My mo ther always dressed beautiful, 
and she was a very beautiful lady. And we
 ended up moving because my  father

heard wh at was happening around him, and 
he was worried that in a small city, 
people know us. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And if we go up to 
Budapest
, we would have a better opportu nity to surviv e. 
Even  though mo st of the people didn™t be
lieve it can happen where we lived. It may 
happen in  
Poland
, but it won™t happen in
 Ko lozsvár
. So my father went up and 
secured in a Œ a room in 
Budapest, 
and there was such a tremendous amount of 
shortage of Œ of apartments already. It mu
st have been either I was four or five, I 
have no reco llection of the date. And my 
father talked very little about my life 
before the war, after I came 
back. And we moved up to 
Budapest
 and all of a 
sudden we had to sh are one apartment un
it with several familie
s. And I remember 
that was a little difficu lt. And my moth
er™s father, who had long beard and 
pa yo s
, 
you know, the usual, sometimes he stayed
 with us. And in one room my father 
lived, my mother, I, and o
ccasionally my grandfather. 
And it was ov Œ you know, 
crowded, and th ere were some arguments 
about that. I have 
very, very precious 
memo ries of my  grandfather. He always 
had real deep pockets and always some 
goodies for me. He sp oiled me what
ever way he could. And wh en th e 
Œ 
the 
Nyilas
(ph), which is the Arrow Cross came in
to power, I remember that once he 
came home all beaten up, bloody, part of his 
payos 
being pulled out. And after that

I never seen him. He came to us, and he ki
nd of Œ I don™t know where he went, but 
that was the last time I seen him. My fa
ther went to work 
as a printer, and my  
mo ther continued wo rking as a Œ as a ha
t maker. And wh en th
e war broke out, I 
happened  to  visit with my  maternal grandmother in 
Tash nalt
(ph), and they were Œ I 
was visiting with my  grandmother and I have
 vivid recollection of that, that she was 
pre Œ baking 
challah
, and the smell in the room was overwhelming. And all of a 
sudden th ey knocked  on th e door and they  sa
id the Jews are being collected in that 
city. And my aunt, younger aunt, her name is also
 Ibby
(ph), my mother™s younger 
sister was there, and my  grandmother, whose name was 
Sarah
 
Roth
, and sh e says, 
Eva
, you are not Œ sh e didn™t call me
 Eva
, she called me
 Havelah
(ph) --
 
Havelah
(ph), you are not listed on the list, you 
go and hide. And wh en it gets dark, 
you will go to the rabbi™s house, and th ey
 will send a message for your father to  
come and get you from
 Budapest
.
 Tashnalt
(ph) is pretty much in the 
Transylvania
 section. So my  grandmother left, 
and I was hiding in the fields. And 
they usually kept the keys, I reme mb er her locking up and po
inting where she is 
putting the key. And I was ready to go in
side when a group of Gypsies appeared. 
And I pretended that my  grandmother was 
inside the house, because they had s Œ 
they were telling stories the Gypsies steal 
young children, and I didn't wanted to be 
stolen by Gypsies. And I pretended that 
my  grandmother is in there, and I said,

Grandma, Grandma, the Gypsies, don™t leav
e me alone. Naturally, everything is in 
Hungarian. And the Gypsies kind of stayed
 there on. And I said, just leave me 
alone, my grandma will come out and she w
ill be very angry at you. And they left. 
And I felt like a sense of accomplishment. I 
could fool the Gypsie
s, I™d be able to 
go to the rabbi™s house. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I did. And I think a day or so 
later, my father came. He was note Œ my 
mo ther™s Œ my  grandmother mu st have
 Œ the rabbi mu st have called my  
grandmother, and my  grandmother se Œ and 
my  mo th er sen d  messa
ge to my father, 
who was in a labor camp by th en, what happ
ened. And my father came to get me 
from the rabbi™s house. And my father had to
 wear his yellow star. And he told me, 
if by any ch ance something happens, and I™m
 being arrested, you go back to th e 
rabbi™s house, and I will come and get you.
 As we were walking toward the railroad 
station, the police stopped my  father and 
th ey  took him in. And 
I think we had some 
kind of ag reement where he mo tioned for me
 to go back . I™m seven, this had to  be 
in Ap ril of ™44, so I™m seven and a half that time. 

Q: Right.

A: And I go back to the rabbi™s house. My
 father is being kept overnight there and 
beaten up pretty bad. And he had the 
chutzp ah
 that when they let him go, he did 
say why he came up. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: He asked for a Œ a note from the police 
station that they kept him overnight, 
because he had only a short du
ration he could come and ge
t me. So he had the note. 
And next day wh en we went to the railroa
d station, we got on the train, but my 
father couldn™t come inside the train. An
d before the train arrived, my father 
approached a woman with a 
young child, and ask her if she could take me, and 

pretend th at I belong with her. And th at™s what we did. My was Œ father was Œ I 
could see him from the window, he was 
between the railroad cars, you know, the 
open place where he c
ould stay. And this lady starte
d flirting with the German 
soldiers who were inside the train, and 
I was petrified. That time I d idn™t speak 
anything Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ I was quiet. And when  we arrived to 
Budapest,
 my father tried  to hold my 
hand, and I just run off. An
d I don™t know how I knew 
the way how to get home, 
but my father couldn™t catch up with me, I 
run all the way home. I wanted to be Œ I 
wan t ed  my  mo th er to
 hold me because sh
e Œ she meant safety.

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: A short time later where we lived, the 
apartment was being emptied. And we had 
the choice to go into the ghe
tto. And my mother secured pa
pers to go into Œ I don™t 
reme mb er if we went Œ I think we went fi rst to the Sw iss safe house. And wh en that 

was emptied, then we ende
d up in the Swed ish safe house. And I rememb er once 
when we were in the Swedish safe house,
 my  mo ther hid me on a top of, you know 
those Œ in 
Euro pe
 you have those big cli Œ furnitures, you know, wh ich open s up 
and you have Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: And on top of it was a bask
et, and she put me inside that basket, and she to ld me, 
Eva
, you have to be very quie
t, and ev en if you have to
 go to th e bathroom, you ju st 
stay in that basket until I come and get you. Well, I was th ere for several hours, and 

I think my  mo ther hid somewhere in Œ th
ey had those, like in a elevator shaft 
[indecipherable]
 she was hid Œ hidden there. It was 
an elevator actually there. It 
was between the windows, which you know, 
it was like Œ I don™t see it here, but it Œ 

it™s like a p lace where windows look out, and th
ere is really no access to it, and she 
Œ I thi Œ that™s what she told me, she was 
hidden in one of th
ose places. When she 
came to get me, I remember I was wet, I 
was there for many, many hours. And sh e 
caressed me and told  me everything is ok
ay. And we were trying to sneak out from

the building when the Hungar
ian policeman seen us. And 
she said Œ the policeman 
said, I don™t see you. Go.  
Q: Wow. 
A: So I remember my mother
 telling me that there is no other place for us, we will Œ 
I will get somewhere some false papers, fals
e identity. And Œ I have
 to go back. The 
person from whom we rented the room wh er
e we stayed, she rented one room to us, 
and an  other room to a woman who was actually a 
SS
 woman, became a 
SS 
woman. 
And the lady™s name whose apartment it 
was originally, and the place na Œ I 
remember the address, it was 
ki ra
(ph) 
utsa
(ph) 
tisanirt
(ph). 
Kira
(ph) is street 
number 15, and the lady™s name was Mrs.
 Gross
. My mother befriended the person 
whose Œ who was the
 SS
 wo man, the brother, and we hid with him for awhile. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: And I don™t know what wa
s the reason, my mother felt 
that that wasn™t a safe 
place Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ for Œ I don™t know what was the re
ason behind it. And that™s when  she got a 
name and I got a new name. My name was
 Eva
 
Noig
(ph), and 
no ig
 mean s in  
Hungarian big, so she says, now you are a 
big girl, and I™m going to enroll you to  
school. She enrolled me to school, we we
re Œ she was dressed up, you know, very

12
fashionable, and dressed me up pretty. An
d I was accepted in the class and she 
found a new place. 
Q: And this Œ was this the first time 
you had gone to school, or is this Œ 
A: I never went to school before. 

Q: You never went to school. 

A: And I rememb er I was skipping, I was so happy. And in  
Europe
 you have these 
round places where they have advertising 
posted. And I remember g o ing by there, 
and my  mother saying, we™ll just go get 
our belongings from that person wh ere we 
stayed for awhile. And I have
 no idea the duration how long
 we were there. And as 
we were passing that round thing, somebody said, Mrs. 
Katz
? So we were turned 
in. We never got to the apartment. And we
 were marched to the police station. And 
at o n e  po in t my  mo
ther says, come on
 Eva
, sneak off, and I was frozen, I couldn™t 
move. And for years afterwards I was fee
ling that maybe if I would have moved, 
my  mo ther would be alive today. From th
e police statio n, they
 knew who we were, 
we were taken to a place called Œ a brick factory 
[indecipherable]
, which was like a 
holding place.  

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And from there we were s Œ th
ey were marching us toward 
Germ any
. You have 
to realize th at most people had a little warn
ing and had some clothes with them. We

had ab solutely nothing, my  mo ther wore fa
shionable shoes. And every so often they 
gave rides for children on,
 you know, those horse? 

Q: The carr Œ  
A: Carriage. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, where they carried their 
Œ and every so often Œ and one day my  
mo ther ask if s-she could come, because he
r feet were killing her. There were a few 
children on that wagon. Short time later we 
heard shots, and I never seen my  mo ther 
again. At night when  we arrived, they 
had like a makeshift Red Cross station wh ere 
people were united. And I remember ever
y time the door opened, I was listening fo r 
my mother™s steps. Never came. And I 
was crying. There was bombing going on 
around, an d I just couldn™t believe it. Ho
w could my  mo ther leave me? And there 
was a woman who was working at that Re
d Cross station, and she says, until your 
momma co mes, I take care of you. And 
actually, I was with her until we got to 
Ravensbrück. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: She got Œ she was half Jewish, or I don™t 
even know if she was 
half Jewish or she 
bra Œ did something, but they gave her a di
fferent position, they  didn't put her in the 
lager, and I was separated from her. When I arrived to 
Ravensbrück
 they took the 

 
Interview with EvaBrettler

clothes which I had on, which was very 
limited. And by that time the weather™s 
changed and it was cold, and I was freezing. They  shav ed my  hair, and I had to  go 
through a
 
so-called spray where they disinfecte
d you from Œ oh, by the way, wh en 
we Œ before we arrived to
 Ravensbrück,
 I was put in cattle cars. And I remember 
some people died in the cattle car. We were
 shoved in, that yo
u couldn™t even move. 
There was no fo od, nothing, and it 
was dark, you couldn™t see. In
 Ravensbrück
 I 
reme mb er going th rough th at disinfectant area, and I came from where Œ you know, 
we didn™t go naked anywhere, and I was so
 embarrassed being nake
d, and I tried to 
cover myself up. I didn™t have much developm
ent yet, but still, I just Œ the idea of 
doing Œ and I remember a woman putting a stic
k to me, and sh e said in German, put 
your hands on the side. Yelling at me
. And even though I probably didn™t 
understand, but I knew what I need ed to 
do, so I did it. And I remember kind of 

running between Œ it was almo st
 like a train, you know, a st
ationary train, and I was 
walking between it because I was thinking, 
maybe I should just fall between it. And 
one of the women, she was a little older, 
it was almost like she 
read my mind. She 
asked my  name and held me. And I kind of
 Œ she atta Œ she kind of adopted me. 
And in the barracks in 
Rav ensbrück 
where I was, we were in the upper, you know, 
they had layers of Œ 

Q: Mm-hm.

A: Œ cots, you know, wh er
e you know, like bunk beds. 
Q: Right. 
A: And we were on th is mi
ddle one. And I rememb er one mo rning, her arms were 
around me, but she wouldn™t mo ve. And I re Œ 
I tried to tell her wake up, we have to 

get out of bed. And they  se Œ some wome
n must have seen wh at I was doing, and 
they said, oh my God, she di
ed. So I laid back on her, I 
wanted to  die, too. And the 
women didn™t let me, they pu
lled me off. I have no idea
 how long I was in that 
barrack. But I rememb er once hearing a baby cry. And the wo man™s whisper to me, 
he says, you have to be Œ keep it. We have
 to keep this a secret. We are going to 
hide the mother and the ch
ild. So there was actually 
a baby being born in the 
barrack where I was. And I said, oh my God,
 will I ever re Œ ha
ve children of my 
own? Will it ever happen, or Œ and all thr
ough the time w h en I was totally petrified, 
I repeated the 
Shema Israel
 over and over. I kind of we
nt in my own private little 
world when I said the prayer. 
Q: Was it like a meditation almost? 
A: In a way. And I remember praying, please God, give me the opportunity. On ce 

while we were in
 Ravensbrück,
 there were a lot of people speaking other 
languages. I don™t know how I communicated, 
I really have no recollection of that. I 
think mostly in Hungarian. Bu
t I seen a soldier at the w-wires, and he was with a

big dog, and I was petrified of those Ge
rman Shepherd s. And he to ld me in 
Hungarian, come closer, and he gave me
 some food. And he said, if I™m here 
tomo rrow come again, and I give you. I we
nt there next day, he wasn™t, but the 
Russians were approach ing 
Ravensbrück. 
I didn™t know about it, but the people 
were talking about it. And they Œ we we
re being collected. So me people hid. I 
didn™t. We were pushed again in cattle ca
rs, this time directly, we weren 't being 
marched. And I was taken from mar Œ
 Ravensbrück
 to
 Bergen-Belsen
, excuse me. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: 
[coughing]
 When they opened the cattle cars, 
the first thing I remember seeing 
in 
Bergen-Belsen
 when they marched us in, were 
the big mo untains of bodies. And 
I remember I just couldn™t take off my eyes from it. And there was another little 

girl, a little older than I, and she pulled on
 my hand, and her mother and I Œ her 
mo ther and her kind of adop
ted me. Except the rations wh
en we got, sometimes the 
mo ther didn't give me my  ration, she took
 some of the rations and gave it to her 
daughter. Everybody in 
Bergen-Belsen Œ 
someti mes, I reme mb er g o in g  by  the area 
where there was a kitchen, in back  of the 
kitchen, and th ey ha
d potato peels backed 
up th ere. And th ey pushed me through, beca
use I was so small. And the first few 
times I brought out the potato peels, ther
e w as nothing left for me. And I remember 
some people telling me , oh you saving me 
by giving me, and I think the idea of 

 
Interview with EvaBrettler  
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
17
helping somebody really sounded good for 
me. I remember the third and fourth time 
they push ed me in, I ate first, before 
I brought out some potato peels. Raven Œ 
Ravensbrück
 was bad, but
 Bergen-Belsen
 was horrible. I don™t know how long I 
was there, but all I remember th at my f 
Œ I was so cold my feet got frozen. And I 
was going to go to the hospital or clinic, 
whatever they had th
ere, and the women 
didn™t let me go, because they said, you go 
in there, you won™t ha
ve a leg left. I still 
have a little mark on my leg where it was 
frozen, but my leg wasn™t amputated. 
When I was liberated in 
Bergen-Belsen
 by the British on April 15
th
, I remember 
getting some food from some of
 the soldiers. And they lo
oked at it Œ the children in 
marvel. I th ink the food I ate, or whateve
r, I became so sick, very soon afterwards. 
And while I was in Œ actually, it was, I didn™t get sick right away, it was like a f Œ 
little while later, because I re
member meeting that Mrs. 
Gross
 who rented u-us the 
room. And she told me
 Eva
, come on, I take you back
. And I told her, I™m not 
going back to
 Budapest,
 to
 Hungary
. I™m sure my mother 
is dead, otherwise she 
would have come and 
got me during this time. And pr
obably my father was killed, 
too. I said, I™m going to live in the King™s castle in 
Sweden.
 I heard about the 
woman who took care of orphans in
 Bergen-Belsen
. People were whispering about 
it, and heard Œ I Œ all I heard was that her name is
 Luba
(ph). And I wanted someone 
to take care of me. I wanted to be togeth
er with other orphan 
children. And I said,

I™m sure I™d be able to go to 
Sweden
. And I don™t rememb er the process going 
through, how I ended up. Bu
t before I ended up going to
 Sweden,
 I was in a ho Œ 
for a long time in a hospital because I wa
s so sick with typhus. And there was a 
British doctor who really liked me. And he
 says, my wife and I don™t have any 
children, we™d like to adopt 
you. And I told him the same
 thing what I told Mrs. 
Gross
, I want to live in the King™s castle. I h ad it so bad. I w Œ I want some 
servants, and I want people to take care of 
me. Well, I Œ just before I went on the 
boat to
 Sweden
, I met the young girl who I connected in
 Bergen-Belsen
, and her 
mo ther died. Sh e apologized to  me. And sh e hugged me and kissed me, she says, 
I™m sorry if we Œ any wa
y you were hurt. And on the boat going over to 
Sweden
, I 
reme mb er there was another Hungarian gi
rl who had th e sister who was Œ he 
couldn™t speak Œ deaf.  

Q: Deaf. 

A: And after the first time I was in terviewe
d, she actually got 
in contact with me 
because it Œ her husband worked at 
Yale. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And my late husband became very sick 
and I never really connected with her, so 
this is something I™m Œ still have to 
do one of these days. So I ended up in
 Sweden
. 
I don™t know exactly when 
I went. And I was in a orphanage, first time. We didn™t

have no more schooling, but I started to lear
n. And we were bei
ng prepared to go to  
Israel
. First time I was told I™m worth somethin
g, I™m special, I can do things. Look 
at, you su rvived, and you will be a soldier in 
Israel
 and you will help us build
 
Israel. 
And I reme mb er having camp fires and singing and really had a wonderful 
comradeship, you know, with 
other children. I r Œ I rememb er being Œ going on the 
Œ you know, the slides,  you 
know sa Œ i-in the snow? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And just doing ev erything, you know, as a 
[indecipherable]
 so for me that was 
very special, I liked it there. 
Q: And you got to be a child
 in a w Œ in a wa Œ in a way that you weren™t able to. 
A: I was Œ I wasn™t for quite some time. 
And then I Œ I rememb er Œ and I connected 
with 
Luba
(ph) there. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I forgot to mention some
thing, that I had the ring.
 And I kept that ring all 
through the camps under my  tongue. Because 
that was Œ I felt if I survived, that™s 
the only way they™d be ab
le to recognize me, becau
se I changed so  much. 
Q: Right. 
A: And while I was in 
Sweden
, my Œ the ring became small on my finger, and I 
moved it to my little finger. An
d it slipped off, and it went down the drain. And that

Luba
(ph) was holding me for hours, and said, 
Eva Œ 
she didn™t speak Hu ngarian, so 
by th at time I spoke Po lish. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: She says,
 Eva
, the ring is not who you are. Your
 mother will be always in your 
heart. And that was the end of my  ring, 
but I had that very close connection with
 
Luba
(ph), and I talked about her many times. 
And wh en I was Œ okay, I get back to 
that. One day I™m being called that my father
 is alive, and he wants me to go back. 
And I think I had the telephone convers
ation with my fath
er. Somehow they 
arranged it, and I remember tellin g my fa
ther, the only way I come home, if you 
promise you won™t argue any mo re, and you
 won™t play too mu ch  cards. Naturally, 
my father promised. And I must have spok
en to him in German, because we were 
educated in German. And in 19
47, January, I went back  to 
Hungary
. And I didn™t 
know how to  speak Hungarian, because Œ it wa
sn™t that long time, but apparently a 
child forgets easily, and learns. 

Q: Right. 
A: And by that time I™m 10 years, I just 
turned 10. And they
 enrolled me to a 
religious school. My father remarried, I 
had a new mo th er, and a new brother. And 
while chronologically I was 10, I survived 
for a few years by the wit, and a certain 
street smar t n ess. Andwhen
 somebody told me no, I 
wanted to know the reason

behind it, when  I came back. And my  fath
er said, what happ
ened to you, it was 
horrible, but we are not going to talk abou
t it. We want you to be, quote unquote, a 
normal child. And you will ca
ll your norm Œ new mother 
as mother, because she™s 
going to  raise you, an d you have a little br
other. He was six m
onths old when  I 
came home. And you will go to
 school. They hired a tu
tor who Œ who was teaching 
me how to speak again Hunga
rian. Can we stop a minute? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
[break]
 This is a continuation of the interview with 
Eva Brettler
. Now 
you Œ your father came back from 
Œ for you, and you went back to 
Buda pest,
 and 
you had a new mother and a new little brothe
r. Did it surprise you that your father 
had remarried already? Cause it Œ there wasn™t a long time Œ 
A: I was shocked. It was 
very short duration, yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And actually there™s some family disagr
eement about that, because some of my  
aunts, my father™s sister, said, how do you know she is dead? And 
then he said that 
he was told that she is dead
. It happened more often. I 
Œ my father was the type of 
person who needed someone, and she Œ my  
stepmother, in many ways was good for 
him. She was a strict woman an d everything
, and she lost her first husband also, in 
the Holocaust, so there was 
something. And my father, wh
en  he wanted something, 
he went after her Œ and, very handsome 
man. And he had Œ she had difficulty and

she was alone, and a lot of people connected
 after the war. And they got married in 
March ™45, and my  brother wa
s born in ™46, so you Œ yo
u know. So it was little after 
a year. I brought up something when I wa
s interviewed in 1982, I went and asked 
certain questions of my father, he was s
till alive. And my st
epmother said, you 
stinker. You were so angry at me, you refuse
d to talk to me. And 
I told her, Mama, I 
didn't  speak the language. All these year
s sh e was under the impre ssion that I was 
angry at her, and that™s why I didn't sp
eak the language. I could speak with my 
father, my father spoke fluently Yiddish
, and if you spoke German, Yiddish was 
understandable. It was, in a way, typi
cal. She is a very strong woman, and 
unfortunately my  brother is not doing as 
well as he could be doing in life. And 
partially had to do with ma
ybe my father being a little t
oo giving in to her needs. 
And I felt a little bit deserted by him. And 
mostly I felt d eserted because I couldn™t 
talk about her. And a couple 
of times I approached him 
to talk about my mother, 
and he refused to tell me anything. So , wh
atever I found out ab
o u t my  mo th er was 

much later, when I co
nnected with my mother™s siste
r, w ho su rvived. Her name is Œ 
was 
Blanca
. And also with my  aunts and uncle
 through my father™s side. So, I 
didn™t have an easy childhood. 

Q: Right.

A: I came h o me, my father at that time wa
s running a grocery store. And befo re that 
he had some black marketing ways of doi
ng things. I think for awhile they called 
him the salt king, because he went to
 Romania
, brought back salt, and th ere was no 
salt in
 Budapest
. 
Q: Right. 
A: So, he had all kinds of ins and outs. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And so he, you know Œ and I helped 
out occasionally, deliver things, you know, 
from the grocery store, until the communist
 government took over things. I ended 
up going to a Jewish school, a Orthodox sch
ool. And the first day I went to school I 
was taken to the prin cipal office, the princi
pal introduced me to my teacher, and the 
teacher had to go to the bathroom and he
 said something tome to go into the 
classroom. I misunderstood him, and I wa
lk ed into a boys™ classroom, and they  
were saying the mor Œ you kno
w, the morning prayer, the 
Modeh Ani. 
And I hang 
up my  co at, and I hang up my  backpack and I 
see everybody staring 
at me, feel kind 
of awkward. And the teacher ask me in Hungarian Œ I understood Hungarian, I just 

couldn't speak it Œ and the Œ he ask me, wh
at are you doing here? And I said Œ th e 
teacher told me to come in. He says, you 
are on the wrong floor, you have to go a 
floor above. Well, all of a sudden everyb
ody heard somebody speaking German. So

I was nicknamed for awhile, the Kraut, wh
ich you can imagine how delicious that 
felt. But all of a sudden, people heard 
about me. There weren™t too many children 
that came b ack. And from early on I kind of
 took on certain Œ I don™t want to say 
leadership, but I was independent, okay? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I spoke up, like I mentioned befo re
, I questioned things. And people found 

out that I came back from the camps, and 
suddenly there were a lot of people 
coming to our home. And I reme mb er peop
le coming with pictures, wanting to 
know if I remember seeing 
some of their relatives, a
nd so on. I™m 10 years old. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 right. 
A: So as a 10 year old, I kind of adapted to
 the situation, and I rememb er crying and 
telling them, I™m sorry, I don™t remember. 
And I promised to write. I don™t know 
how I even could promise 
[indecipherable]
. And I remember so mebody said, I™ll 
give you the money to write. I said, give 
me the money after you get the answer, or 
something to  that nature. Going back Œ an
d we had a grocery store, and I rememb er 
once getting a basket of lik
e, those light biscuits. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You have to remember, I lived in a pl
ace where sweets and things like that, I 
obviously had a sweet tooth, were limited. 
So I decided to have one, then another

one. By  the time I took it home, the box of 
biscuits were gone. And I couldn™t live it 
down . My stepmo ther was bringing it up a
ll the time. So I ended up kind of getting 
mixed messages, you know. In one hand, they
 admired that I survived, on th e other 
hand, at home I was miserable. I really 
was miserable. My stepmother™s mother, 
who left illegally with her 
son to  displaced person place, she couldn™t stand it there 
and she came back. And if I turned at ni
ght, she accused me of doing so mething. I 
didn™t know what she was 
accusing me, but she Œ so I Œ I really had it difficult 
being home. So, I mu st have been  about 11 and a half, I befriended a girl, and I 
said, can I move in with your mo th er? And I approached the mo ther, and she loved 

me. And she was a widowed  wo man, her husb
and didn't come back. And I made all 
the arrangements. I went home to pack, and 
my  step mo th er to ok  me asid e, sh e  say s, 
you cannot bring that kind of a shame on your
 father. You can™t do that. So that was 
kind of my  childhood. I Œ I reme mber t
hose days, punishment 
was that you were 
actually beaten, and my  father tried to h
it my  brother and I stood between my  father 
and my brother. So my father took o
ff his belt, and I ended up getting a nice 
beating. So being home wasn™t exactly 
comfortable. Did I crave being among the 
kids I were, where I was one of many, and 
we kind of looked out fo r each other. 
The younger ones, you know, and the older one
s looked out for me. So I Œ I realized 
I missed that. So from early ag
e on, I realized that I had 
to look out for myself. And

I think that stayed with me 
for the rest of my life. Ma
ybe it started already in the 
camps, and it continued. I made friends. I 
was selective, but I made good friends, 
and I kept them. I tried to be good friends, 
and they were good 
friends for me Œ to 
me. I Œ when I went to 
Israel
, I fo und out that I probably cried more than I recall, 
because some of my old classmates were 
telling me they remember me crying.  
Q: Does Œ so  wh en you went to this sc
hool, this Orthodox sc
hool, did Œ did you 
stand Œ besides being called the
 
Kraut Œ 
A: Didn™t last long. 
Q: Didn™t last long. Bu t did you Œ 

A: No. They  got the Œ 
Q: Œ were you th e only chi Œ survi Œ were
 you the only child that came back from 
the camps? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did th at Œ did th e other children ask 
you about it? Did th
ey talk about it? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: No. But they all knew 
that you ca Œ had come back from the camps? 
A: They knew that
 I came back from
 Sweden
. How much they kn
ew where I was, I 
really don™t know.  

Q: Mm-hm.

A: I stayed in the Orthodox
 school until the state took over. So that was in the sixth 
grade. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So seventh and eighth grade, I had to go
 to the local school where Œ the district I 
belonged to. Apparently there was way of
 doing it, but it cost money and they  
decided I Œ not to do it for me. And from a straight
 A
 student, I went down, because 
I had the one teacher who picked on me non-
stop, she was not Jewish. And I used to 
be exceptionally good in math. And sh e was 
cruel to me , so I took a book with me 
to class, an d when she was teaching, I wa
s reading. So  the pi Œ my  parents were 
called in that I misbehave, a
nd so on. So from a straight 
A
 student, she ridiculed 
me; oh, in the Jewish school they give 
good grades easier , don™t they? Next year, 
when I didn™t have her, my
 grades went back up.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I liked school. I liked to learn. 
Q: Right.  
A: When  I graduated at age 14, eighth grad e was mandatory. My  mo ther called 

together so called advisory 
committee, and they decided 
my grades, I™m not such a 
good student, I should go learn a trade.  

Q: Mm-hm.

A: And they found a place which didn™t wo
rk on Sabbath, because I wasn™t working 
on Sabbath. 

Q: Right. 
A: I started  to work there, and I realized
 that something was ha
ppening to me which 
I really don™t like. And I work
ed in a textile factory, and I learned how to desi Œ you 
know, you had to design textile.  
Q: Right.  
A: And in th e olden days they had Œ I™m
 Œ I™m sure I won™t have the English 
equalant 
of the word, but each thread y
ou had to pull through a needle. 
Q: Mm-hm, like a loom. 

A: Yeah, and you made the design. 
Q: Right. 

A: And that loom was put in a machine, and that™s how they made that. 

Q: Mm-hm, right. 
A: Well, I was young, I did 
very fast, and I became a

Q: Mm-hm.

because the new norm will be much higher. 
So, I worked very hard, and I still got

together occasionally with Œ 
I got together with the frie
nds I made in the Jewish 
school. And I belonged to a group where we
 kind of had after school activities. And 
I realized I have to do some
thing. So I am about Œ clos
er to 15 by now. I didn™t go 
to school for a year. I found out there is
 a school where they Œ you can become a 
chemist. I will try that. 
Q: You said you like math. 

A: I like math. In order to go, you had to 
go through a preparation class, and I did 
that. And I did exceptionally well, I ha
d good math skills a
nd so on. And they 
accepted me to school. But the problem was th
at the factory had to
 request for me to 
go to  school. And I wasn™t in a communist
 party or anything, so I didn™t qualify. 
And the school requested me from the fa
ctory, because this factory send a few 
people to do, and they didn™t 
qualify, but I did. So I work
ed Œ oh, I forgot to tell you 
then, the hours changed, 
and I had to become a 
[indecipherable] 
Shabbas, that 
meant that I had to work on 
the Sabbath, too. And that hurt me mo re than anything 
else. And when I started school, it was at 
nighttime, so they c
ouldn™t put me Œ I 
used to work either from six 
to two, or from two to 10. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: And I was petrified because the factory 
was next to a cemetery, and at night to 
get to the bus stop I had to go by th e 
cemetery, and I™m only 14 years old.

Q: Right. 
A: So I was Œ I™m surprised they allowed 
children that young to
 work that hours. 
But a lot of thing ch anged, because they
 took me out from the assembly line and I 
started to work in the lab.  

Q: Wow. 

A: Yeah. So, you actually h
ear more about my after Œ 
Q: No, it™s Œ it™s very interesting. I mean, 
esp ecially, I mean, gi
ven your age, given 
your circumstance, th e fact that y ou star
ted school later than
 other kids, and you 
were able to Œ to achieve that Œ 

A: So Œ 
Q: Œ in such  a short period of time. 
A: Yeah, so I actually was working, and th
en the factory in th
e Œ where I worked, 
they send me out to work  at university
 on research. I was going to a technical 
school at night. And I really Œ I befriende
d the person, you know
, I had to give her 
my  wages, and I befriended the person wh
o gave me a phony paycheck. And I had 
some money to spend, because I was supp
osed to give all money Œ so  I learned 

early on that there are certain back wa
ys, yeah. And my  relationship with my  
mother wasn™t too Œ 

Q: Right. 

 
Interview with EvaBrettler

A: Œ too good. And not because Œ I did try. 
I really tried, but if I hugged her, you 
squeezing me hard. So you kn
ow, it was Œ and Œ and my fath
er wasn™t really there Œ 
that much there for me so th
e irony is that now my step Œ my father died, and I™m in 
charge of my  grandma Œ my  stepmo ther and I do take care of her.  
Q: And your brother still Œ 

A: My brother is Œ he hasn™t worked for 
a number of years. 
My mother helps to 
support him and his family. He married, he
 has two young children. So, I really 
didn™t wanted to talk about that.  

Q: Yeah, okay. 

A: I appreciate if you don™t talk about that. 
Q: That™s fine. When did you come to the 
United States
? 
A: So, when  the revolution broke out. 
Q: Aha, here we go. 

A: I was on my way to school when I h
eard there will be a bi
g demonstration front 
of the parliament. So I went with anothe
r girl who was about to get married. And I 

said, it™s a lot of Œ we Œ we should be ther
e. So I was actually at the point where the 
revolution started, when all the speeches 
were going on and everything. Wh en I got 
home that particular day, I remember I cam
e home late, and my  au nt and uncle were 
visiting from 
Szatmár

gates to the apartment buildin

because there was no transportation, you had 
to walk home. And I 
told them that I 
probably will be leaving. By
 now I™m 20, 20 years old. 
Q: Yeah, right. 
A: I wasn™t quite 20 yet, but close 
to 20. And the revolution was October 23
rd
, and I 
would be Œ a Œ a few months
 later Œ a m Œ a month later, almo st. And I went with 
another friend to  the train station, packed
 up. The only thing I pack ed  up to take 
with me was my Red Cross certificate in ca
se I get caught, I would say that I came 
to help people who need 
help. And I brought my  pray
er book with me. And no 
pictures, nothing. Those were Œ and my photo
 i.d., which I still have. And the girl I 
started out with, she had mo re money, she could go with  the transport. I met one of 
my  stepmo ther™s cousin, who was helping 
other people cross, and he ended up 

taking maybe the bus, and several other fami
ly Œ families, we went to a little city 
called
 Burschavkine
(ph) and I crossed the border there to 
Austria . 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And it was during the night, and it was a 
bigger transport of people. And I stayed 
behind with the family 
who had th e young child.

A: We are cra Œ we actually crossed the border and we didn™t realize we were 
crossed already. So for awhile we were

 stepmother™s first h u sband. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It™s a small world. 
Q: Yes. 

A: And there were a lot of young people
 wh o crossed, and I rememb er one saying 
all the Jews are leaving. So I turned  to
 him, and what the hell are you doing here? 
So the guy was ready to beat
 me up, and this family, they put me in the middle of 
the children, next to the wives, and th e hu
sbands on the end. So  they  protected me. 
The next day we left. I had an  address in 
Vienna
, and we went up to 
Vienna
. And I 
connected Œ in that particular place I c
onnected with quite a few Orthodox kids I 
knew. And we went to somebody™s home wh
o is Œ actually, he was a reporter from 

Austria
, and he was related to one of the 
young men who I crossed with. And, I 
reme mb er going in to th at apartment and th e husband was caught in 
Hungary

the wife was having a party. And when  
she seen us, she put us in the kitchen

because we looked too dirty. 
She didn™t want it to ruin th
eir party. So after that we 
ended up going into  like a holding place, 
you know, it was a big s-school which was 
converted. And I stayed th
ere for a short time, until 
they opened, the Orthodox 
community opened th at big hotel. And I st
ayed there for a ve
ry short time. And 
through the Joint and 
HIAS

. But before 
the
 HIAS
 and th e Joint accepted me, they gave 
me a prayer book. 
They wanted to 
make sure I know how to

claimed to be Jewish, who weren™t Je

for them. And my father said

following day. 

Q: Mm-hm.

maybe a couple of days in 
New York. 
And from
 New York

Q: Wow. 
A: Œ I really had a beau tiful, beautiful connection. And for a long time my  

stepmother was a little jealous on her sist

Q: What mu st it have been like Œ what was it like for you leaving cold

A: You know Œ don™t fo
rget, I™m 20 years old. 
Q: Right. 

A: So look a little different

have relatives here. You can go later to
 
Israel,
 let™s go to 
United States
, you can always go to
 Israel.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I felt a little guilty coming here, but once 
I was here I managed to kind of adapt 
to the currency Jewish, and Œ and being w

gave me private tutoring in English, I di
dn™t speak a single word English, but he

crush on me. And my  ha Œ

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I went to work here and 
I worked Œ I went to Jewish
 Family Service, and they 
found me a job, and my first job as a ch
emist. They  thought, if you do ch emistry, 
you can become a Œ dye clothes in a clea
ner. Well, the problem dyeing clothes in a 
cleaner was that that was so heavy, and to
 move those heavy things, I just couldn™t 
handle it. Oh, I had a job before that, th
at was even funnier. I Œ it w as where you 
make window shad es. And he says, I give 
you mo re hours to wo
rk, stay and work. 
And then  he says, I also want you to meet
 my  son. I told my father, I™m not going

Q: Right. 
A: Œ religious girls. So I think th ey 
started to match you up very early on. So  

coming to the 
United States, 
and walking around, and seeing all the things, it was 
absolutelyamazing. I met my 
late husband probably ab out four mo nths after I came 
to the 
States.
 My parents arrived and then  I move
d back  with th em
. And I lived in 
the Orthodox area. And they were trying to
 match you up daily. I had a blind date, 
somebody came to the house, one guy I ha
d nothing to do with
. The second one was 
pretty smart. He came in, he sized up the s
ituation, he seen that my stepmother was 
the person in charge, and he started to ta
lk with her. And I played the games with 
some of my  brother™s friends. And he kept
 on calling, and four week s later we got 
engaged, four weeks later I got married.

 who had the child 
from the first marriage. And my late husba

 engineer. He was also a su rvivor. 
Unfo rtunately, he never talked about his 
experience. His father was killed the last 
day of the war in 
Debrecen
, which is in 
Hungary.
 And to some exte
nt it turned him 
against religion. And so  the kids kind of
 had to do a mess
age about religion.

almo st spoke again. So  apparently is some
where buried, and it needs to be retrieved. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I tried Swedish, I have a friend who wa

Q: And he was Œ he was in

A: He wasn™t in 
Budapest

 Budapest. 
I don™t know Œ 
Q: But he was in the general area, he wasn™t sent Œ

A: Yeah, he was working outside. And like 
I said, unfortunately, I really never got 
the story from him.  

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. A-All I know, that he got a letter from my  grandmother. And th e letter 
said, all these years I tried 
to help you to grow up. I™m
 s Œ we are starving. My 
grandmother was together with my  aunt, 
who had twin  children. And they were 
famished. And there were witnesses who 
seen my  grandmother, that beautiful 
grandmother of mine, who was marched in
to the gas chamber holding onto one of 
her twin grandchilds. Yeah. And the husband
, the son-in-law surv
ived, and my aunt 
kept in touch with him. He remarried afte
r war and have a other family. But most of 

Œ all my aunts and young uncles were kille
d. My grandfather, my father™s father, 
died just before the wa

Szatmár

Orthodox commun Œ you know, was a very 
well known, that big yeshiva is there. 
And I reme mb er visiting th er
e as a child, my  grandparents. I did some mischievous 
thing there too. I let out the neighbor™s rabbit. I don™t know what the rabbit was 

doing th ere, and I know that I got in troubl
e. I did some mischievous thing as Œ like 
I said, I was a spoiled little girl

I™m much better now.

Q: I guess the la Œ wh en Œ one of the thin
gs that I™m curious about is, you know, 
you were seeing all of these dead bodies 
as a child. Did it Œ were you afraid of 
them, or were you afraid that you would be
 one of them? I mean, I guess Œ it™s Œ it™s 
one of those things Œ 
A: You know, whenever I see dead bodies, 
I always look for my
 mother. And for, I 
think I was already married when probably
 I stopped. I was always hoping that 
either she had amnesia or something, a
nd somehow she will come
 back again, find 
me. I think the idea of losi
ng my  mo ther Œ she was not only my  mo th er, but she 

really gave me the inner strength from very
, very early age on. And my mother was 
amazing, I didn™t bring that out. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: She risk her life, and she smuggl
ed food in for people who were 
incarcenated 
or 
something. So, I looked up on her. She 
was beautiful, she was Œ she was there. 
Q: Right. 
A: While my  father was, you know, all over. He Œ my  father was a very good man, 
people adored him, he was hu-humo rous. 
I mean, he made the 
jokes all the time, 
and my  fr Œ girlfriends were Œ thought my
 father was somebody Œ you know, the-
they used  to come over and stare at him.
 I think I missed my  mo ther tremendously, 

in a sense that Œ especially 
when my Œ she and I were in 
hiding in this Œ you know, 

 
Interview with EvaBrettler  
 
November 9, 2008 
 

 
 
47
and my  father wasn™t in the picture any mo re
. She really talked to
 me like an adult, 
and 
co n f ined
 in me and 
tore
 me like Œ I didn't tell you about stories that, when we 
were on the far Œ fictitious Œ you know, for 
Œ you know, we were 
in hiding with that 
man. And I reme mb er walking, and she taught me how to put the cross on me. And 
at that time already I™m seven and half, ei
ght? I™m eight probably  Œ no, not eight, 
because eight I was already 
in the camp. Instead of pu
tting the cross, I scratched 
myself. And my mother said, don™t do th
at. She said with one word, and next 
minute she kissed me, that I couldn™t put 
a cross on me. So, she kind of seen the 

good in me, which for Œ you know, I Œ I th
ink that reassurance 
meant a lot to me, 
and that acceptance. I really looked up 
to her, she was someone very special. And 
she could put up with my  Papa, wh ich wasn
™t the easiest thing those days. It™s kind 
of sad because when  my  father became si
ck he totally withdrawn. He was making 

jokes and everything, and when  he got sick
 he became withdrawn, he didn™t go to 
the shul any mo re. He used to go every 
mo rning, you know, to daven, you know 
what that means. Yeah. And 
wh en he became sick he totally withdrew himself and 

he Œ wh en  my  late husband died , he died in  ™87, December 24
th
, it was such a big 
loss for my father, losi
ng my  husband. It was Œ he rea
lly looked up 
to him, they 
really did a lot of things together. My 
late husband was a wonderful chess player, 
and my father was a good chess player, they  played chess. They
 played pinochle

together, you know, cards together. So Œ an
d I took, you know, my
 fa Œ I left my 
late husband home, he played cards with my
 father, or played ch
ess with my father. 
And if one of them won you heard about it for days, or 
vice-a-versa.
 And I took my 
stepmo ther shopping, you kn
ow. So , you know, there was a division between it. 
Q: Right. 
A: And I did play Œ I didn™t play  chess w
ith my late husband, but I played a mean 

player Œ mean hand of cards, and so di
d my  kids. My kids, from early age on got 
tremendous amount of self reliance, in a 
sense. You have to be independent, 
because my brother wasn™t so independent, 
and we wanted to ki
nd of Œ we kind of 
over Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And the kids™ education 
was Œ emphasis put on, to the highest degree. And my  
late husband took su ch pride in it that a
ll of us became college graduate, including 
his wife, you know, over here. And my  kids
 were exceptionally good studen ts. My 
Œ one of my  daughter attended 
Ha rva r d
, you know, as a undergraduate. And Œ to 
become, you know, the professions they ch
oose, and they are s
till leaders in their 
community, so they learne
d something at home.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with EvaBrettler

A: And I, as a young American I had an 
accent, much worse pr
obably than even 
today, and I was active in school activities.
 I was the treasurer 
for the Boy Scouts, 
for the Girl Scouts. I became 
a room mother representative. So I Œ I was a typical 
American. I visited women 
who didn™t have husbands 
and helped  them out, you 
know, to connect them. And 
then  my  late husband says
, you do it anyway, go back 
to sc Œ get the degree, and Œ and do it full tim
e. So I went back to school and I did it 
because I still tend to ov
erextend myself. I h ave that tendency.  
Q: You™re living life. 
A: I try to give back, because I feel that 
I survived, and I surviv
ed because of, as a 
young ch ild I probab ly couldn™t have surv
ived if somebody wouldn't have give a 
kindness to me, but they did. And I, if 
I can help somebody, I like the idea of 
helping, and through the Ch
ild Survivor organization, I made friends, which is a 
combination of friends and relatives. I Œ to 
some extent they are maybe closer than 
you can be to some relatives, because you 
can talk about the pains and ev erything. 
And nonjudgmental. 
Q: Do you find that a lot? 
Do you find that Œ th at peop
le judge you because you did 
survive, or Œ have you 
experienced that before? 
A: Oh yes. My poor step
mother™s mother, her son 
Shlymie
(ph) was killed, and he 
was apparently a saint. I never knew him.
 And she told me. Not once, not twice.

And then she apologized, y
ou know. But she personally to
ld me, and I have been  
told, you know. We went to conference, 
I will never forget, the guy wasn™t aware 
that I was in camp. He said
, what do you know, you were 
just a child, and you were 
not even in the camps. Or, yo
u were Hungarian, you were
 a shorter length of time. 
So, you know, they don™t even
 know, but they  look at y
ou as a child, and you know, 
you were a child, how 
would you know wh at 
suffering really was? 
Q: Right. 
A: I mean, suffering was pretty crucial. I 
mean, there was a time I h ad clothes, in
 
Bergen-Belsen
 I remember I put something under 
my hat that Œ and I slept on it, 
that you know, I was togeth er with Gyps
ies, couldn™t get away from Gypsies. So, 
there were Gypsies in the same barrack 
where I was. And in the morning, it was 
gone. And I remember puttin
g some kind of a blank Œ 
it wasn™t a blanket, but 
something like it, around me. And when  I had to stand 
achtung
, you know, the line-
up, the woman throwed it off from me , the 
same way, you know, with that stick. 
When I see those sticks it scares the day
light out of me. And for a long time I was 
petrified of darks, too. So it Œ it was re
ally Œ I mean, I list ened to some older 

survivor describe and it Œ flashes come ba
ck to you. You know,
 things wh ich you 
think you fo rgot, and then kind of ha Œ I 
go to sleep and all of a sudden I Œ I see

certain things which I didn™t realize that  they were Œ some were stored in the 
memory, they laying. And 
it Œ they come forward. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And like, recently, just in Œ I think it 
was in June, I was involved in the Bearing 
Witness program with 
UCLA
, did you hear about it? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I was ma tched up with a young ma
n who comes from a Iranian background, 
I think he was born here alre
ady. And we had like three or four sessions together. 
We met for lunch, and Œ and I rememb er
 when  I told him how old I was in 
Bergen-
Belsen
, he went in almost like a state of 
shock. And I rememb er touching him and 
holding him. His Œ I said, I™m here. And he 
just couldn™t Œ what did you do all day, 
was his a Œ a question. How 
could you be here? So I r
ealized it™s Œ even for me, 
when I look at my gr
andkids, it™s hard to 
believe that a person at that age, I don™t 
know. God forbid nobo
dy sh ould be tested on it. And 
I Œ when last year I came 
back from 
Israel
, I went to visit my daughter, b
ecause my granddaughter™s birthday 
is November 15
th
. So I came back two days later, I flew to 
Seattle
. And I looked on 
my granddaughter, she just 
turned eight. And I realiz
ed I was in the camp, I 
probably  didn™t even  know wh at day it was. 

Q: Mm-hm.

52
A: And tears got into my eyes and I star
ted to cry. And my  daughter and I went a 
little later o n  a ride, and she says, Mom, I 
can™t handle it. I can™t handle the idea of 
knowing wh at pain you went 
through, and I can™t handle 
you associating it with my 
daughter. So I heard it.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I Œ I™m respecting it, and I Œ I 
make a point of not bringing it up.  
Q: Right. 
A: But my other daughters Œ my st
ory was written up re-recently in the 
L.A.
 Jewish 
Journal. It was about four or five people 
were in the Indestruc
tible Spirit project, I 
don™t know if you heard about it. 
Q: I haven™t heard about that, but you 
seem like a good subject for that. 
A: Well, and they quote me Œ they took 
a picture of my  youngest grandson and I. 
Bill Aron
, did you hear of 
Bill Aron
? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: He™s a very well known photographer an
d he Œ he took pictur
es of quite a few 
survivors. And there was a write-up, you 
know, somebody interviewed me, and er Œ 
and the story about the potato peels was wr
itten on. And with my  grandson, I am 
holding my grandson. And my  10 Œ 12 year
 old grandson was reading it. That™s my

ned, and cruelty wh ich happened, some 
of them I probably still cannot talk 
about. And maybe they are better Œ 
Q: Left unsaid, yeah. 
A: Œ not to be said. I have memo ries of st
