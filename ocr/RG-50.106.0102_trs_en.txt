Question: This is a United States Holocau
st Memorial Museum Volunteer Collection 
Interview with William Luksen
burg conducted by Esther Fi
nder.  Today is May 26th.  
We are in Silver Spring, Mary
land.  This interview was part
 of the mu seum's project to 
interview Holocaust su
rvivors and witnesses who are al
so volunteers with the museum. 
[technical comments].  And I am going to  start 
with your liberation experience.  I'd like 
to know where you were wh
en you realized that you 
were finally free.   
Answer: I was, before liberation we were on 
a death ma rch.  The death march started in 
Regensburg, all the way to the Au
strian border.  I was actually, 
they let me g o , they didn't 
shoot me.  I describe it later on. My liberatio
n came in a little town 
Liebenau Bad Abbach 
(ph) along the Austrian border.  On the way,
 during th e March we didn't  know it was the 
end.  We kind of seen that th
ese guys didn't care mu ch.  Th
ey  were older, like Hungarian 
SS, and so on.  And as you marc
h you, wh enever you, you find 
yourself at the rear of the 
column  you know you get shot so
 everybody kept on shoving 
forward.  In other words, 
they didn't have to tell you to press because 
when ever you find yourse
lf at the end of the 
column  you knew th at mo st likely get shot fo
r not keep ing up with 
the group so you push 
forward.  You push, wh at I mean, you schlep
 your feet with the 
shoes, you don't pick 
your feet up anymore. So somehow or othe
r my feet got tangled up and I fell.  And I 
closed my eyes and I expected 
a shot.  It didn't come.  And I looked the corner of my 
eyes, I seen  the column going down.  And 
it felt good, I didn't  have to walk.

And I was laying there and a friendly--must 
of make some mo aning noise or whatever, 
and a German farmer with a oxen came by, 
picked me up, put me on his wagon, hay 
wagon, and brought me to a big farm.  And I remember sitting there 
and they gave me a 
piece of bread, big piece of bread with butter, a
nd a big glass of milk, and I could not, my 

stomach couldn't  take it.  I threw it up.  
And I sat there and I was breathing so  heavily.  
And they  had the doctor come in and look at me and he thought I had tuberculosis, he 

hardly  touched me. Wh at happened also whil
e I was there I was--uniform was completely 
covered with lice.  We didn't  bathe or clea
n since May--since January till May.  So they 
took my  striped clothes off and gave me so
me of their own old clothes. And there was 
some German wo man would open up the gate of
 the farm, took one look at me and cry.  
Never seen anything again look like that.  
I weighed about 65 pounds, had a beard.   
And so next day the farmer come s over.  He 
says, "The Armies are here."  I didn't know--
they call the Americans "The Ar
mies."  He put me back on the hay wagon, brought me to 
the town Liebenau, to 
the Americans. First thing, they
 undress me and pour the brown, 
yellowish-brown powder, which I later on fo
und out was DDT.  Only  people who went 
through what I went through can understand all of a sudden the heat from the lice eating 

your body completely stopped.  All of a s
udden the whole world 
stood still. And I was 
very fortunate that I w as liberated  by th
e American Army because there was some 
colonel who took th e docto rs from the small town
 Laufen and pressed them into service.  
And there was a women 's prison there.  They
 took th e prisoners, women, and they moved 
them.  And they, they, 
all the survivors were taken in, they were treated there. And I 

Interview with Willi
am Luksenburg  5 
remember the first morning, the first round, 
I was laying on a wh ite sheet and I have seen 
the doctors on the first round.  And I felt, I fe
lt so bad.  My heart was, like, palpitating 
and I remember seeing--I was laying on a white sheet which meant a lot because I hadn't 
slept on a white sheet since my parents went 
to Auschwitz in 1942.  And I felt I would 
die.  And I really felt sorry for myself.  I knew I was liberated and I start to cry.  And a 

German doctor went over to me and he felt my  pulse and he said in German, "Wein sie, 
wein sie, sie ghense scraper home ich (ph)." 
"Don't cry, don't cr
y, you are very mu ch 
undernourished."  And I rememb
er the next day they came in
 and they would, some other 
American officials came in, 
they would unco ver me to s
how how a human body looked 
like, and they would uncover me.  I couldn't
 stand looking at my  own body because the 
biggest part was my  knee and the bone and ev er
ything was just, just dry bone.  They  kept 
uncovering me, I kept on covering me.  I couldn't
 stand looking at myself.  As a matter of 
fact, one soldier took a picture of me and I 
took one look at it and I tore it up.  I couldn't 
stand it looking at it.  Wish I would have ke
pt it today. And I was very fortunate that I 
didn't  get a ny other, you know, disease s.  Some
 people had typhoid and so on.  I just was 
undernourished.  I was fed intraven ously and 
the nurses would walk out with  me holding 
my arms, g et me into the sun,
 an d a few months later I came to. But I could not stand 
being in jail.  I still had, was in a jailhouse with
 bars out there.  So I heard that some--the 
Army 's, the American Army 's down th e valley.
  So walked out, we
nt down there.  I 
shouldn't have.  There are some people from 
Chicago speaking Po lish, because Polish is 

my mother tongue, so.  
They took me in.  I remember th ey
 gave me first aid to help out 
the ________, because 
all the--I couldn't hold them up. 
 So they gave me a job to 

Interview with Willi
am Luksenburg  6 
distribute coffee to the soldiers, 
to hunt the coffee for them a
nd distribute.  And I felt I am 
not going back to the jailhouse.  So  I was, I 
was given by one of the Germans a room on 
the, on like an attic and, you know, I came
 back quickly because I had good food.   
And I remember one day that the food was 
cooked like big alumin
um kettles.  We had 
chocolate cake, turkey and so
 on.  And they  were digging a ditch and I see they are 
dumping that, that food, that good food in to the 
ditch.  I said, "No, no, no."  I said to him 
in Polish, I said, "We have some people up in
 Liebenau and they d
on't get that kind of 
food."  He said "No, no Fr
auline, no German Frauline."  
Want to make sure--they are 
giving me food but I shouldn't give to the Ge
rman girls.  I said, "No, no."  And I had 

some coffee so I bartered the 
coffee for a motorcycle.  And 
I came every mo rn ing, ev ery 
day, after chow time, all strings and bags
 and so on, came rolli
ng in, into the big 
courty ard.  The prison had a big c
ourty ard, the office in front of
 it.  I used to roll in and 
all these guys was yelling at me, "Here, here."
  They wanted some food.  Which was nice 
and I did that for quite a while. I--but I reme
mb er so me wh ere in  th
e neighborhood there 's 
my clothes, my jacket is somewhere there.  
I have to get--I had a mo
torcycle.  I thought I 
am going to try to retrieve it, may b e some pe
ople want to see what we look like.  And I 
was cruising and cruising.  I rememb er when 
the farmer put me on th e hay wagon, kind 
of made it--tried to rememb er.  The barn ha
d a special roof and a special look.  And I 
kept on driving for maybe a week and a hal
f, and I almo st gave it up and at the last 
minute caught my  eye and I drove in. And at th
at time the Germans we
re very, they were 
not as secure as they are now.  She came in
, she said, "Mchten some 
soup," "I want some 
soup"--soup means potatoes and 
some milk.  I said, "No, don'
t be afraid of me, I just 

Interview with Willi
am Luksenburg  7 
wanted to  dig up my  clothes, my  jacket, go ba
ck to the station."  We made a fire outside 
and a kettle and boiled it out.  Came to a bo
il, I took it off, rung
 it out, threw in my 
backpack and drove off.  And I kept it all thes
e years in my closet. 
 Once in awhile my 
friends would come in, I tried it o n , and the firs
t time I tried it on I ripped it.  That's how I 
recognize that's my ja
cket.  And I put it back in the cu
pboard.  And I kept it all these 
years and actually I was intendi
ng to give it to Yav H'shem 
(ph), before was any kind of 
talk about museum.  Yav H'shem
.  When I heard the museum 
was being built I said to my 
kids and my  wife that's where I'm going to  br
ing my jacket.  And I made appointment.  I 
came down.  And I kind of felt like very comforta
ble.  I didn't  expect make a big deal out 
of, take so many pictures out of me, made me
 feel comfortable.  I just came down to 
make sure that someone is there to  receive it. 
 So that's the story of
 my jacket. I want to 
come back.  One day came in, ri
ding on a mo torcycle, on that 
big--jail, and I see a lot of 
people standing in front of the office.  Was 
big office like, on the, on the mound.  And I 
said, "What's going on?"  "A Jewish girl is here
."  Well, I hadn't seen  a Jewish girl since I 
left in January, we weren't together, I forget 
my  first _____ and look at Jewish girl.  And 
I getting closer and I am looking at my  cousin
.  My cousin was looking fo r her husband.  
She was traveling all the way up from Bayreuth
 from north.  Those days they  didn't have 
any kind of transportation, you 
just hitch-hiked on trucks to trains, trains go fo r half an 
hour and they stop.  And so , she said, well,
 you co me with us, because this is my --this 
one uncle by marriage.  So of course I want 
to have.  I me an I felt, you know, after we're 
liberated I didn't , I knew I had lost my pa
rents because went from--I knew where they 
went.  Bu t I didn't expect really anybody 
alive.  I knew my  older brother went to 

Interview with Willi
am Luksenburg  8 
Aush witz.  So I kind of felt lo
st and I didn't think I had an
ybody left, but that felt real 
good.  So I traded my 
mo torcycle for a watch.  In those days watch, was a big price to 
have a watch.  And we hitch-hiked back to
 Bayreuth . In Bayreuth  I was given a nice 
room in a villa and we had a lot of other survivors and they we
re already organize 
kibbutz for preparation to Israel, and I felt r
eally at home because I had someone.  But I--
we had th e government, huge government in  New Yo rk, his name was Captain Cooley 
(ph), and I--he got off my wife some pictur
es of a lady who was acquainted.  She was 
older.  She knew how to keep a household. 
 She was given a beautiful villa from a big 
Nazi that had a lot of crystals and beautiful
 furniture.  So I reme
mber the first Passover 
and I got those pictures.  We invited some Je
wish soldiers.  And the crystals an d, you 
know, just beautiful.  It was such a nice, nice thing to be there.  I 
felt so good, felt my 
Jewishness was coming back .  You know, I ju
st--as an oppressed person we're very mu ch  
alive.   
Q: I have a couple of questions that I'd like
 to ask you before you 
go further.  After the 
war was over did you witness any acts of re
tribution or retaliation against Germans or 
collaborators?   

A: Well, the only th ing we'v e seen--I'v e seen not
 really.  I myself w as very sick so I did 
not see any action because I was really not th
ere.  Because the only thing I remember, 
when, for the preparati
on to open up that jail, the wome
n's jail, they put us in a big 
gymnasium to wait till they clea
n up and so  on.  And there we
re quite a few survivors.  
Some of them looked pretty good.  And th e 
Americans didn't  real
ize they caught two SS 
so they pushed them in.  I don't know why they
 did it.  And at that time these guys, you 

Interview with Willi
am Luksenburg  9 
know, they had so mu
ch, you know, was so much bad bl
ood, and they, and they killed 
them, in no time.  And, as a 
matter of fact, the American 
was surprised, angry at them, 
thought maybe they get 
some beating or something.  I 
don't know why th ey pushed them 
in between us people.  And I remember they 
tried, somebody tried to take off his ring and 
his watch, and I was laying in the corner.  I 
was just half dead.  And the two guys mu st 
have been fighting for the ri
ng, where the, where the tote
n cuff would be, and by fighting 
it they lost it and the ring ju st swung to ward  me so it came around and I just kept it out 

and I kept it.  My son got it.  He wouldn't gi
ve it to me.  He said it was his ring.  That's 
the only thing I saw, because 
later on the Germans were very
, you know, you'd  see those 
white flags all over, they 're serious, and they
, they always blame everybody else but not 
themselves.  They always pointe
d out to Hitler. I did not really, 
although I myself felt if I 
had been liberated in January, 
like some other people did, I'd have been volunteer for the 

Russian Army  and I would have been the first one 
to go in to fight.  
I was so cl ose to my 
mother and I always remember 
th at she was with me all th
e time an d I could actually, I 
couldn't kill a fly now but I co
uld actually kill a lot of peopl
e dead, just remembering my 
mother, how she died.   
Q: You told  me that you knew wh at happened
 to the memb ers of your immediate family.  
After the war did you make, did you initiate a
ny attempts to find any other relatives or 
friends from before the war?   
A: Well, after the war every 
community you encounter as you 
travel you put your name.  
You have--and ev ery Jewish community has a l
ong list and people read them and mo st of 
the people remember, when
 you meet them say, hey, I've se
en this and this
 in this town 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  10 
on the list, he's alive.  So th
at's how actually people find 
themselves.  At that time we 
didn't  have communications as we have, kno
w now.  Especially right after war in 
Germany th ere was none.  So  that 's how peop
le kept on traveling a
nd lo oking and leavin g 
their names on lists, different cities.  People 
would remember.  That's how slowly, slowly 
people got together.   
Q: I wanted to make sure.  Did you go 
back to your hometown  after the war?   
A: No, I did not.  I knew what happened to
 my  parents.  I knew what happened to my  
older brother.  And I met--I wa
s going to Czec
hoslovakia a few times.  I had a special 
entry permit to go but those days the Amer
icans were occupying Prague under the 
agreement, under Allies agreemen
t, then had to pull back.  
And I used to go back and 
forth and bring some people from, crossing fro
m Poland to Prague, Czechoslo vakia, and I 
had a entry system to bring some few peop
le with us.  That's what I did.   
Q: Okay .   

A: And I met a friend of mine who actually 
lived in th e same home, same house where 
we lived, and he told me not 
only nobody's there, they don't,
 they even bulldoze down the 
cemetery, they bulldoze down th e synagogu
e, there is nothing abso lutely there 
hometown.  And coming back  I my self, as 
a y o ung boy, I experience very much anti-
Semitism calling.  Unlike my wife who lived in
 the Jewish section, so they had schools, 
the fact of--Jewish school because the neighb
orhood was Jewish, wher
e I grew up we had 
very few Jews, a lot of Polish people, and the sc
hools were run by priests.  And as a kid I 
experienced, I've been called really all 
the time Jew.  A nd y
ou're n o t--I had bad 
experience as long as I reme mb er.  We 
had a religious lesson once a week, on 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  11 
Wednesdays, I remember.  So all grades Jewish
 boys would walk together because if you 
walk singly you get beaten up by other Po lish boys.  So we usually walk groups all 
grades together.  As a group, you know, we 
had mo re power, then nobody would beat us 
up.  That's how, you meet in one place then 
walk to the school as 
a group.  So I really 
didn't  have good memories living in Poland.
  And my  wife and my  oldest son and my  
daughter went to Po land.  I couldn't go back to
 Aushwitz.  I couldn't go back to Poland.  I 
remember incident when my 
father was _______ was stopped by Polish policeman.  He 
stood in front of him.  He took his hat o
ff in front of him.  And whatever the Polish 
policeman said you'd say, "Yes, sir, yes, sir."
  And I stood a little boy holding my father.  
And I could not, I said to my wife, I could no
t stand, as a free man, for somebody call me 
again what they called me origin
ally, so I rather not go becaus
e I mi ght get in trouble.   
Q: When you became reunited w
ith your cousin and the othe
r surviving family members 
can you tell me what that reunion wa
s like and what you spoke about?   
A: Well, first of all, the cousin who wa
s looking fo r her husband, they  finally got 
together.  They were sweeth
earts before the war and it wa
s quite, you know--as a matter 
of fact, she lost her husband in the '67 War.  
Whenever we come to 
Israel, she is a widow 
like he died yesterday.  She takes us today to
 his grave and so  on.  So  that was nice to 
have somebody. There was a uncle by marriage 
but, you know, those days, you know, we 
kind of kept together.  We needed  each ot
her.  There was a group 
of people and were 

organized like a Jewish committee and, as a ma
tter of fact, the Jewi
sh community was the 
richest one. A small incident.  A lady wh
o lived in Richard Wagner's home went 
down stairs in the basement a
nd they found big wo oden  boxes full of silver.  So the poor 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  12 
woman has been trying to make a living, wa
s making ice cream.   And so she would sell 
the ice cream with expensive 
Wagner, Richard Wagner silverwa
re, was one of the things.  
But we had a, like a co mmunity-like.  We go
t together and, you know, we were given 
from Germans different special treatments like. 
 They  actually, you know, th ey give you 
nice homes and so on.  But unlike other plac
es, people stay in their barracks and they 
would stay in those barracks, because when I we
nt to Bayreuth I lived in a nice villa and 
everybody has nice villa so it 
actu ally wasn't such a trauma
 like other people had, where 
they had been behind barbed wires 
and living in barracks and so fo r.   
Q: So are you telling me you were never in a DP camp?   
A: No.  No.  The only one, I 
was in that wo men's prison and 
I couldn't stand because I've 
seen those bars, I figured that's not the pl
ace for me, and I went down and I met the 
Polish, Polish soldier 
from Chicago, spoke Polish and so 
forth, and then my cousin came 
in and I moved out.  So  I didn't 
have such a bad experien ce.   
Q: Did you have any reunions with
 other people that you met be
fore or during the war?   
A: Definitely yes.  We--I met a young womanin Rysw ick, and there was no touching.  I, 
you know, I always was mechanic
ally inclined.  I realized wh
en I came first day in prison 
camp that people with some kind of know-how ha
ve more of a chance to survive.  And I 
was always a kid that was mechanically inc
lined, always doing, making something and so 

forth.  So I want to describe my first, my 
first day when I came to 
the, to that new camp. 
Can I describe my first experience when I ca
me to prison camp? I remember w h en I was, 
I was--I escaped one time, before they sent
 me to Germany.  In Germany I jumped, 
escaped from school wh ere they kept me before th
ey sent us to prison camp s.  And I was, 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  13 
I was caught and they put me 
to the bad prison.  And ?mis
loyalty? put me in solitary.  
That was the most horrible part of my experi
ence.  Slide you down.  You can't fight.  And 
they serve you food in a bucket 
down  there.  There is no room to sit down, to  stand up.  
You just rest your butto cks on the one part th
ey cut out and your knees on the other.  Yo u 
hear screams all the time.  It's
 night all the time because th
ere is no sun.  I don't know 
how I got through it.  And I--they pulled me up on 
the chain.  I really 
didn't feel sorry for 
my self but I was thinking ab out my  mo ther, sh
e should see that I'm walking in my leg 
chains, and I figured she, she wouldn't  believe
 that.  But instead of Aush witz they send 
me to the big prison camp, Resamay (ph). An
d my  older, my  older brother, he came back 
from prison camp.  Was a dentist.  They  se
nt him back.  And he 
was telling me who he 
knew, who he met, and I reme mb er he wa
s telling about they
 using a ________+, 
Demarek (ph).  But here I am in a prison, 
a huge prison, about 10
-, 15,000 prisoners, and 
I see Demarek walking by.  So I yelled out to
 him, "Herr Demarek."  He was a German 
youth.  Luxembourg.  If he remembers we we
re friends or were on th e same room with 
my  older brother.  He said, "Come sie here, come
 sie here."  He came in, took me to his 
barracks, right away  gave me a bowl of soup,
 and he says, "I kn
ow a good prison camp , 
I'll send you."  I didn't know I already was 
bought.  There's a guy who called the Lumen.  
This guy was like limping one leg.  He woul
d buy like blocks of 
people, like 500 people 
for different kind of factories.  I w as bought al
ready, sold to him, but he says, "I know a 
good prison camp, I'll send you."  And he put 
me on that list. And I 
reme mb er I came to  
that prison camp, came at night, all the dogs
 and lights, and it was quite an experience 
coming first prison camp .  And I went next day,
 they put me in the pick and sh ovel.  And 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  14 
I never held  a pick and shovel in my  hand, so
 at the end of the day I had blisters on my  
hands, and had just blisters 
here, I hadblisters 
between my  fingers, and I knew next day 
they kill me, they hit 
you over the head.  I remember ev
en the company I 
worked for was 
Bengera (ph). So I had a friend, she was actua
lly a friend of my  older brother, Wola zu 
Polska.  And I walked over--sheworked in the kitchen.  I wa
lked over to 
the window and 
I says, "Wola, tomorrow will be my last day 
because they going to kill me, I can 't hold a 
shovel."  So she knew someone 
that put me in the sick room. 
 And they apparently afraid 
some infectious diseases so 
they make like a fever and th ey
 put some kind of grease on 
my hands.  And then she said, 
"Can you do something else?"  
I said, "I will do anything."  
So they looked for st
eam roll operator. I was a kid.  I ha
ve seen a steam roller operate, I 
never operated one.  So I came over and the 
German came in, said, "You a steam roll 
operator?"  I says, "Really, I don't know how to 
operate."  He says, "You mu st be honest 
Jew because only Jews only lie."  So he showed
 me how to use it.  And that was one nice 
thing.  I didn't--I got away from 
the shovel.  That's  when I r
ealized from then on I must be 
some kind of value because othe
rwise you will never go on the 
list.  When you stay with 
a pick and shovel you don't ha
ve no chance to survive. At 
the incident with the steam 
roller, the steam roller had--like 
today hard drive brakes--had me
chanical brakes.  I had to 
push very  hard to stop the steam roller and to tu
rn, some turn it to the left and right.  And 
the steam roller is a very heavy piece of mach
inery and here I go down
 the hill, straining 
my self, pushing the steam roller and trying to
 make a rig h t turn at the same time.  I 

couldn't do it.  I went straight.  So the Ge
rman took the shovel, hit over the wheel and 
broke the shovel off so he had just a handle, and he kept h
itting me as hard as he could 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  15 
and all I could do is put my  
hands over my  head, protect my
 head, and th e guard stood 
there with a gun just waiting for me to make
 next--any move.  He kept hitting until he got 
tired.  He knocked my  front teet
h, he knocked my  forehead, he knocked my  front lip, and 
I thought I lost an eye.  The 
eye was like this.  And next day I came to wo rk like nothing 
to it, you know, with one ey e, and I work ed
 for that company for 
a while and even the 
guy who hit me, sometimes he couldn't  eat, he
'd  point out with his eye wh ere he had a 
piece of bread or something for me to eat.  So
 you can't figure this 
thing out. And then we 
finish the road and th ey build a factory.  So
 they, they  were looking for welders.  So I 
found somebody who was older.  He was a 
welder from home.  I said, "Will you please 
show me."  So he sh
owed me how to do weld and I 
became a welder.  And a good 
welder.  Wh en we turn on the steam I had hard
ly a leak.  It was huge big pipes, like three 
feet in diameter, and you climb on ladders 
and you weld up, you know, like a makeshift 
ladders and so on.  And I rememb er I would lay a bead.  That means it looks like a 

machine, piece of machinery.  The German 
always liked my work, the way I laid the 
bead nicely.  And th en th
ey came in and turn ed on 
the steam, you know, everybody 
would get praises or yelled at you because you 
didn't a g o od job.  I hardly  had a single 

leak.  And then this finished.   
Q: Before I let you continue I had, I wanted 
to  ask you or I had asked you if there was 
feelings you had after the war for so
meone that you had during th e war.   
A: Well, after the factory was built, everyt
hing was finished, they  were looking fo r 
sewing machines.  I said, yes, my  grandmother 
had.  So by th at I was given electric car 
and I was able to move in the part of the 
factory where the women used to work.  Other 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  16 
people could not.  I had, you know, prior to
 movement I used to pick up materials on 
factory and back and forth, and I start ta
lking to the young wo man.  There was no 
touching, God fo rbid .  But we used to take 
a cement bag, old cement bag, write a letter, 
throw it to her, and she would throw it to me
 or somebody else.  See, women used to 
work three shifts, eight times three.  Men used
 to work 12-hour shifts
.  So once in awhile 
we would go to wo rk  and th e wo men would co
me back, we would wave at each other.  
And at one time there was open--no, that was 
before the access came.  They would open 
the gate and I would talk to her or sometime
s they would let us come into the fence. 
There was a dividing fence between us, men and 
women.  I would talk to her.  And I told 
her, said, you know--whatever I said, I didn't belie
ve I am going to su
rvive.  I said--I was 
young.  I said to her, "After the war we
'l l get married." And I can't remember.  I 
reme mb er on th e, we went on the wagon, on 
a transport wagon.  Helen was so--the men 
was in one wagon so  she jumped
 from the other wagon to be close.  And we didn't get, 
we didn't receive any food, an
y kind of provi
sion.  We just lucky.  We were open cattle 
wagons.  There was snow.  We drink the sn
ow, and we had some 
kind of--you know, at 
least you got water, you can survive.  And ther
e were--we went to Czechoslo vakia.  The 
people really, they were very 
brave to stay on the bridges and thro w some bread, because 
they were shot at.  So I am always resource ful.  Rather than fi
ght with everybody--and 
can you imagine when you thro
w a bread betw een 50 people wh
o are hungry.  But, so I 
sat on the edge, high up on the edge on
 the train, on the cattle car, cattle wagon. 
Somebody was holding my  leg and wh en th ey 
thro w bread I caught the bread in mid-air. 
And I, I wanted to give to Helen half the br
ead.  But you cannot th
row the bread over to 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  17 
other side, give it to Helen.  Everybody's hungr
y.  You'll never get it.  So she lean over 
one side.  The train was moving.  I lean over 
another side.  And we were long time with 
holding out to stretch your arm and I threw the 
bread, and of course she didn't  catch it.  
She was never forgiven 
for that.  But that wa
s one time episode.   
Q: We're going to have to pause now wh ile I f
lip the tape and then you can continue.  Just 
o n e  mo ment.   

  (Pause to change tape) 
  [Technicalcomments] 

Q: And you were tellin g me about your encoun
ter with the woman that
 was eventually to 
become your wife, and I'd like you to  continue.   

A: Well, we were separated in Flossenburg, in
 Rh einsberg, excuse me, and I was sent to 
the terrible prison camp at Flossenburg.  An
d I was staying on Sunday, listen to the 
church  bells down the valley, 
and I was looking at the mo on
 and I was thinking wh at 
happened to her, was she alive. 
 Well, it was so cold.  And I r
ealized that I won't be living 
long so I been volunteering fo
r work outside.  And of cour
se I was sent that time to 
Regensburg.  Regensburg.  And the Allies, 
unknown to us, were coming.  We were 
walking nights and resting daytime.  And of
 course, you know, coming back I was found 
by so meone.  Now, after my  cousin found me
 we were in Bayreuth.  Helen, in the 
meantime, coming from Poland, fo
llowing a street car, some fo
rmer cop, I remember she 
said she sa w me in Prague.  So she yelled at 
them, she told them that I am aliv e.  So 
Helen knew I was alive.  And then on my trip
 back somebody said that she was, too, told 
me that she was alive and sh e was in Prague
.  You know, people se
e each other. So the 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  18 
next time I was going to  Prague they were hou
sing some refugees where used to  have 
stalls for horses.  They were huge, big barn
s like for horses and some people would lay 
there on the hay or some--I just
 remember open up the big ga
te and yell, I said, "Helen, 
Helen."  Some people there say, "No, n
obody here by th at name." And, an yhow, 
circumstan ces got so that Helen found out wher
e I was, so she sent me a note t h at she is 
in, right in Oberhaus, would I like to see he
r.  She herself didn't know after all we were 
engaged or, you know, there was no kissing, no
 touching, no nothing.  And I tell you, a 
young person, you know, a you
ng person, even circumstances like this, you think ?ank? 
?nolow?. And so  I was away and I came in 
that weekend and I got dressed and I boarded  
a train, and on th e train I found somebody who 
knew the town.  He to
ok me in.  And in 
those days the curfew, all the doorways to 
the apartment always lock ed.  So  somebody 
came with me, and Helen had dr
opped the key to open  the ga
te.  They say, "You know 
who is here, follow me."  She 
got so excited she couldn't fi
nd the key.  So, an yhow, we 
met and embraced.  And I told her again, I said
, "I would like to get married."  And that 
watch which I traded for my motorcycle I gave
 her as well.  That was a big thing.  And 
we kept on courting ourselves.  I 
h ad that uncle by marriage.  He left, he left to America.  
Apparently he had some relatives here.  And 
he didn't think I shoul
d get married, that I 
am too young for it.  So after he left, I was b y
 myself, I said I'm mast
er of my  destiny, so 
we decided to get married. Got married in 
'47.  And Helen's family had somebody who 
was strictly Orthodox so  I had to  run and ge
t pots and pans, Kosh er pots and pans, but the 
sad part, you know, Helen cooked  all the food
.  We didn't  have caterers.  And the pots 
and pans.  And so, and I brou
ght up Helen--I had some money.
  I bought right after the 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  19 
war a big ju nk yard.  But Helen says, "No, you are not going to  live in Germany."  So  I 
sold the junk yard.  And I ha
d on, in the junk yard a car fro
m Hermann Goerin g, burnt up 
inside.  And the only thing I pulled out befo
re I sold it, the Hermann Goering car.  And 
the Russians, who would buy anything had four
 wheels and a steering, so I restored the 
car.  I drove up to Hof.  That was the Germ
an border.  And I got a lots of old German 
marks.  I came in loaded.  But 
that's how we got, we had m
oney to  get married.  Because 
you have to remember, after the war there 
was no food and anything you had on the 
rations wasn't enough, so you 
had to pay a lot of money if 
you want to get married.  So 
finally after work, both days we were fasting, 
of course.  That's  trad
itional.  Before you 
get married  you fast all day long.  And under
 the huppah those days
 the tradition was to 
take ____________ to pray 
for the dead, which was hard
. We were surviving by the 
UNRRA, who had given powd er
ed eggs, powd ered milk.  And those days there were, 
there were lines.  So wh at the really funny pa
rt of it, what you do first, you ju mp in the 
line, then you ask what the lin
e is for.  Because you actually need ev erything.  Sometimes 

would have toilet paper.  You ge
t two.  Well, first you get in line.  You don't want to go 
in line--I was on business in Munich and there is
 a long line, so I jump
 the line.  What's 
the line for?  The line is to register for Amer
ica.  So I stood and I registered.  And su re 
enough th ree mo re--you got to realize, we were
 liberated there was no Israel, America the 
doors were closed and, you know, nobody wa
nts to live--after the Pogroms in Poland 
people were coming from Poland
--nobody wanted to stay in
 the god forsaken camps.  
And so, well, there was nowhere to go.  
There was--President Truman was a great 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  20 
president.  He sign in a law to send in a 
hundred thousand dispersed persons.  That 
doesn 't mean just Jews.  There were all kinds
 nationalities.  We came on that corridor.   
Q: While you were still in Europe, before
 I had you coming to  the Un ited States, you 
mentioned that you got some help from the 
UNRRA.  Were there any other organizations 
that offered you any help by way of food assi
stance or educational assistance or anything 
like that? 
A: We--I went to school for a while, techni
cal school, and I rememb er we had our teacher 
from a big factory from--he was in cell comple
tely, he run aw ay from the Russian front 
and he was teaching us.   

Q: You want to take a break?   
(Recess tak en.) 

Q: You asked for a break and we'r e back now. 

A: Yeah, actually that was a, organized by
 the ORC school, and I had some technical 
training there.  That helped a 
lot when I came to this country
.  I had some kind of idea 
about technical work and so  on.  And--. 

Q: When  did you come to
 the United States?   
A: Labor Day 1949.  September the 9th.   

Q: Before I have you leaving Europe and 
telling about your experiences in the United 
States I wanted to ask you abou
t two events that occurred while you were still in Europe.  
The Nuremburg trials.  I want to know how
 closely you followed the Nuremberg trials 
and what were your thoughts during th at time?   

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  21 
A: During the Nuremberg trials
 I was following closely but so
mehow I felt that they were 
given a fair trial but all our peop
le never got any kind of fair tr
ial.  I felt it wasn 't fair for 
those people who killed 
millions of people get a fair tr
ial with lawyers and so on. 
Somehow or other I felt it was so
 unjust that they can, they
 can have attorneys and they  
can blame everybody else except 
themselves.  I was really an
gry.  I was following, yes, 
but I didn't understand American justice then, th
e American way of life, and I just, I just 
felt they should be just string up, but that 
is not the way it is, but at that time I had 
different kind, I had no idea about justice, 
you know, because when I left Poland we have 
different kinds of laws and re
gulations, different kind of wa
y of justice.  Kind of felt 
funny for me that they 
treated them in a nicer manner, nobody
 gets hit and they get nasty.  
Throughout all the time I was angry really
 that they getting so mehow trial, asking 
questions, they have ch ance to blam
e someb o dy else, not themselves.   
Q: Did you feel that ju stice was 
served by the Nure
mberg trials?   
A: I can 't even understand how 
justice could be served.  Actually those people committed 
the most heinous crimes the 
world ever knew, that they, 
men, women, children, and 
murder them in such a brutal 
way.  I, I really, I really--even 
to hang these people wasn't 
good enough for me.  A lot of people bl
ame the older generation, not the younger 
generation.  I felt they should 
suffer for a long time what they
 did to us.  Maybe it's not 
right to blame the younger generation but I 
just cannot forget, cannot forget.   
Q: Also while you were still in Europe ther
e was a U.N. debate about the partition of 
Palestine and also the birth of 
the State of Israel.  I would like to ask you to reflect upon 

that experience, those experiences.   

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  22 
A: I remember it was announced establishment, 
1948, the State of Isr
ael.  I remember as 
a kid that belonged to Zion
ist organization talking about 
Palestine was talking about 
going to  the moon.  It was so far away, so
mething I couldn't believe could ev er, ever 
materialize.  It was, it was su
ch a, a, such a far away thi
ng to , even to think about that 
could be possible.  So when  they  announce th
e establishing a State of
 Israel I'm kind of 
believe it and didn't believe it.  It was such 
a utopia, you know, the State of Israel.  How 
could it be really?  Would the  Gentile worl
d allow something like 
this?  But I myself, 
when I speak to children, I alwa
ys tell them even liv
ing in America we are part of Israel, 
we have someone we can be prou
d, they establish and they es
tablish themself w ith all the 
technology and ev erything else.  I 
give them a lot of credit.  
But at that time I decided to 
come to America and so, you know, we decide to
 go to America, not to Israel.  So that's 
the way we want to do.  Israel at th at time, 
things were hard to get and so  on and I felt 
I've been through such
 a horror, maybe I can have a better life.   
Q: Did you have to take any 
tests, any medical tests or intelligence tests or anything like 
that before you could come
 to the United States?   
A: No.  I didn't have--only thing I had a bad e
xperience, before we came to United States 
we had to  have x-rays, whether have tuberculos
is, so on.  And I, appa
rently I slept with a 
lot of people with tuberculosis and I had so me
 marks on my lungs.  In those days they 
had like a .35 millimeter small film.  When 
I am came to Hamburg they saw those and 
they told me I can 't enter Unite
d States.  So I have to go ba
ck and make a big blow-up, a 
big picture, and everyb
ody said wasn 't tuberculosis.  An
d there was a little bit of trauma 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  23 
too because I felt that someth
ing happened I can 't go, altho
ugh when you go to Israel 
your mo ther take everybody and to America you ju st could not.   
Q: What were your expectations of America?   
A: I really--when I came to America we had 
$20 betw een us but I, I seen it was a open 

world and I never felt poor.  I was, I had so 
much zest to work and 
I felt good.  I came to 
the Jewish Refugee Service Agen
cy, which was a great thing.  That 's one of my  favorite, 
favorite charities.  They really, it really mean
s a lot.  A child, like 
Jewish Refugee Service 
Agen cy, wh en you come they gave me, everyone
, they  gave me $30 a 
week.  It's such an 
enormous thing wh en you come, 
I have ______.  And after three months I could not take 
anymore.  I wasn't raised that way and I said 
I need a job.  I went 
on construction.  And I 
w o rk ed  p r on to .  
Everybody liked my
 work.  As a matter of fact, later on I became a 
journeyman, a journeyman, plumbing journeyman. 
 I went to school here and I became a 
master plumber here.  But when I was German
 I used to run the big jobs.  I was the 
foreman, the foreman of the job, and I met 
some people was building homes.  And those 
days homes were like $16,000 which was to me
 a mountain of mo ney.  So was great and 
sitting and talking to the builder I said, yo
u know, Mr.--name was Berman (ph).  I said, 
"You know, Mr. Berman, I never build  before 
a house like that, $16,000, my  God."  So  
he says, "You know," I says, "I'm start 
building a new, new pa
rt of my  build ing 
experience and I will always make sure that 
you get a home."  I remember he came in, 
showed me the blueprints, "Pick any house you lik
e."  "Well, I'll take a lot."  He said, "I'll 

make sure that you have a down payment."  He
 gave me a slip of paper that I gave a 
down  payment, but actually he did.  He did not
 give salesman's  commission.  He gave me 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  24 
his commission rather than that.  And 
the plumbing co mp any let me  do my  own 
plumbing.  I did my  own plumbi
ng in  the house so I had a certain discount on the house.  
Then  I even  didn't have any labor.  I dug my own ditches and my  wife and my  oldest son 
were holding the light till 
midnight.  I was doing my own pl
umbing.  I have so much zest, 
I want to have a house.  That was a big th
ing, I felt, you know. But in  America money 
talks.  So I became a master plumber, I couldn'
t get fin ancing.  And I knew I had to build 
my family and build somethin
g and you cannot build  wh en 
you work for someone.  So I 
decided somewhere or other I got to go in  bu
siness.  So one Sunday mo rning I looked up 
in the paper.  And, by th e way, we got fi
rst money from Germany.  I got $2,000 and 
Helen got $2,000.  I didn't want to risk Hele
n 's $2,000 so I risk mine.  And I went down 
there and there was a service station.  The gu
y asked me how mu ch m
oney I have.  I say I 
got $2,000.  Those days was 
enough to  buy a load of gas.
  Monday noontime I c alled 
Helen, I went in business. And I worked very hard
 at it.  I went to school again.  I became 
a master mechanic again.  I went to repair
 cars.  And from there the people saw, who 
were running the oil company, that I am 
able person.  They gave me in a better 
neighborhood, a bigger station.  And I made 
success of it.  I start to rebuild different 
things.  I became a rebuilder in addition to st
ation.  I became with Triple A and I became 
inspection station.  I did all thes
e things.  As a matter of fact
, I worked so hard the first 10 
years, I used to get up 5:30 
in the mo rning, get home seven 
o'clock for dinner, went back , 
stayed till 11:30 at night. It caught up with me.  Driving, I lost consciousness and they 

took me to the hospital.  What actually happe
ned to me, I slept through the whole week.  
I was so much short on my, y
ou know, sleeping.  I 
work  so many hours, my  nights were 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  25 
very short, my days were very long.  But th
en  I realize that, you know, I am not made out 
of steel.  So from then on I was going home six 
o'clock.  I told my  help don't call me 
unless the house is on fire. But, see, being ma
rried to Helen, she kept my  books, she kept 
up my  mo rale when I started up.  You know,
 when  you started upon a string you, you 
really don't know how things 
going to work out.  You worry
 you might lose it.  And she 
kept my morale.  In the beginn
ing she used to come in and she used to  bring me parts if I 
needed parts.  I mean
, she was a great help all these years.  And sh e, she was a good 
housekeeper.  She was--we had respect each other.  We had a good life together.  We 
brought up three nice kids.   
Q: You are running ahead of me but I am goi
ng to back you up a little bit because you're 
giving me too mu ch  too fast.  When you first ca
me to this country , I wanted to  ask you if 
you spoke any English and if not
 how you learned English.   
A: When  I came first to this country all 
I understood, yes and no.  Was hard because 
when  you, on th e construction those people 
think that you are not a normal person 
because you don 't speak and they would pick on 
you.  So instead sitti
ng in the shed eating 
with everybody else, like rain
 or something, I would go outsi
de, because it was very hard.  
Many times I got home, I said to Helen, y
ou know, I never understa
nd English, because it 

sounded wah, wah, wah, wah.  As a ma tte
r o f fact, I worked with some people from 
North Carolina I couldn't understand th em now wh en they  speak.  And so , but all of a 
sudden--in the beginning it just 
goes in one ear, comes out th
e other.  All of a sudden it 
gets in your brain, just like that.  As a ma tte
r of fact, I spoke, when ever I went with Helen 
Helen would stay behind and say "you speak."  
 Now it's reverse.  But then I was, you 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  26 
know, in construction.  I spoke
 English.  Then  we made some friends.  We me t some 
young couples.  They to
ok us under care, show
ed us how to, how to
 manage money, how 
to cook American way, how to
 live American way, which meant a lot to us.  We made 
some friends from Austria.  Came from Buffa
lo, all over, young people came to this town  
to start a new life.  Young married couples.  We was there like a toy.  There was one 
person who was from Philadelphia.  He spoke 
Jewish.  So we spoke to him Jewish, he 
translates to the other guys in
 English.  It was a lot of f
un. I was very mu ch preoccupied 
with wrestling.  So the guy that had a televisi
on, he let me watch th
e wrestling.  So on th e 
first anniversary we came here they made me
 a cake with written down--at that time there 
was big wrestler was Mr. America.  They cu t 
Mr. America.  And for Helen, we brought 
an old iron.  The girls couldn't understand be
cause they--your family mu st have real 
muscle over there.  It was, you know, real 
heavy iron.  So they 
felt sorry for Helen to 
schlep that heavy iron, they go
t us on our first anniversary an
 electric iron. But then we 
went to Americanization school for a year
  and, you know, when  you have some 
education you can learn 
another language.  Our education 
was interrupted but still we had 
education.  So we started to pick  up some 
Yiddish papers.  We we
ren't fluent.  So we 
were going to try some.  People that had Hebr
ew, we want to have some news.  So we 
picked up some Yiddish papers.  We slowly 
got fluent with that.  And then with, in 
school, the school was great because they did not
--they forced us to ta
lk English, they did 
not talk any other language to 
us.  You had to learn.  And it was great.  And ev en wh en I 

had, between our friends, between the job, we 
really master our langu
age pretty good.   

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  27 
Q: When  you came to this country did Ameri
cans ever ask you about 
your ex periences in 
Europe and in th
e Holocaust?   
A: Yes.  We met a German coup
le from Austria.  I want to po int it out that it felt so far-
fetched that if we told people what we we
nt through people felt they were like make up 
story.  How can be possibly something like 
this?  People really--and we stopped talking 
about it.  We were talking so mething unbelie
vable, nobody can understand.  The best 
example I have, we met that couple from Aust
ria, and mother didn't send her _______ but 
she sent her furniture.  They lost
 a lot there.  But she didn't 
realize yet the extent of it.  
And we're talking, th e name is ______.  We
 tell her, all the time we spoke through a 
German man, we are telling her all these things
.  She did not, she did not get the comp lete 

picture wh at we were saying.  But 10 years la
ter, or less, they deci
ded to go back to 
Austria, Vienna.  They flew to Europe and 
they bought a car and they  would driv e.  And 
they are driving from Munich and all the way 
to Munich there is a sign:  Dachau 33 
kilometers.  She said, "Sam, ma
ke a right turn, let's go see." 
 The difference is the people 
when  they  say and th ey touch they  have 
mo re pain understandi
ng.  That's  how the 
Holo caust Museum actually is very important. 
 It's, best example, 
when she comes back 
to the States she called Helen crying and a
pologizing.  Wh at she saw actually, you know, 
when she saw it so many years 
later Dauchau was all cleane
d up, but still, she saw the 
ovens, she saw all these things.  Sh e apologized
 that she did not unde
rstand what we were 
saying.  She felt very bad and she cried, sh
e apologized.  Now sh e knew.  So fo r long 
time we didn't talk. Helen had a numb er, want 
to take it off because with a wo man have a 

tattoo you look like you committe
d some kind of crime, but

And somebody ask me to take it off.  I wear it
 with pride right now. 
 But it was very hard 
in the beginning to tell people our story. 
Q: Tell me about your family.  You  have child
ren.  I'd like to know when  they  were born 
and how you chose their names.   

A: Our children were born and 
we did not press too mu ch on 
our past.  We also, maybe a 
mistake, w e didn't speak to them in Yiddish 
or our mother tongue, in the Polish.  We 
didn't  want to sound like they 
are foreigners in this countr
y when we spoke with them.  
But our oldest one, he is very intelligent kid 
from the begin with.  He
 knew, he read, but 
he didn't ask too many questions.  Once in 
aw hile he asked some questions.  Bu t all my  
children grew up nice human being, contri
bute so mu ch, you know, to--is good people, 
intelligent people.  They are all professionals
.  There's one thing in
 my house, there was 
no question, everybody is going 
to have high education.  A
ll was spread up.  Everybody 
read newspapers.  We are all avid readers. 
 And, you know, it's 
a background we came 
from.  We had families, we had parents, we
 had grandparents, great grandparents.  My 
mother and father were involved in  different 
kind of ch arities.  You know, we were not, 
so we were not just coming from any home.  So
 same thing, we made a home, we build a 
family, we gave them a good home, we make 
sure we knew always where the kids are, 

and so, we're retired now and we
 enjoy our--they're all adults
 with families and we enjoy 
them very much.   
Q: You haven 't told me their names.   
A: My oldest son, Dr. Harvey
 Luksenburg, doctor of pathol
ogy/oncology.  My  youngest 
son, Stan ley Luksenburg, he's 
a doctor of podiatry.  He lives
 in Cleveland, Ohio , has two

lovely kids.  My youngest daughter is 31, Am
y Luksenburg Strachman.  She is attorney.  
She got three kids.  And sh e became very relig
ious, which I--very nice because my father 
was a religious man.  And she got a good life 
and nice family.  I really, whatever I got 
left I'm just, I'm thankful to United States
 Government and th e pe
ople who gave us a 
chance.  Me--not for just me
, for my kids, because in Po
land my  kids would never had 
opportunities if we came b
ack.  It's  a great country .  We treasure it.   
Q: I'm not sure I understand something you sa
id a mo me nt ago.  Did you speak to your 
children about your experiences in Europe?  
What did you tell your
 children about your 
life even before the war?  A
nd kind of go in to that.   
A: Well, we'r e telling them sl
owly, once they  are growing 
up, because they'v e seen the 
tattoos and they would ask ques
tions.  And when they were 
young we tell them why don't 
you wait until you get a little older, it's not a nice 
story, we'll tell you when you get older.  
And we told  them.  And they 
knew, they never s
een, they never had a grandmother.  My 
children grew up without grandp
arents, which really I feel ba
d for them.  Everybody, you 
know, every child should have 
a grandparent.  I know my  grandson come in, he jump s on 
me.  And they missed it.  They don't have 
any gran dparents.  None of my  children had 
grandparents.  But they took it in stride and 
they grew up nice people.  And I'm really 

thankful for them and they, you know, we ke
ep close touch and th ey keep  close touch 
with each other.  And me and my wife enjo
y going, visiting.  That's about it.   
Q: You were in this country  during some bi
g changes.  You were 
here during the Korean 
War and the Vietnamese War and for the conflic
t with the Soviet Union.  Did you have 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  30 
any co mme nts that you want to make about wh
at you saw and experienced in this country 
with respect to those events?   
A: Well, being citizen of this country, I felt 
whatever this country 
does, I felt, you know, 
it's right, because they'r e lead
er of the world and they, yo
u know, the men on the street 
got rights but other countries
 did not.  And I felt bad, es
pecially on the Vietnam War, 
because I realized that we really don't fight 
for the Vietnamese, we really were fighting 

communism there, th e spread of communi
sm.  I remember tellin g about the domino 
theory  and so on and so forth.  I did not 
want to be against my  govern ment because I, I 
always treasure and appreciate what they done 
for me.  S o  I felt that this government, my 
government, decides to go to Vietnam, alt
hough it's wrong, but I would not do anything 
against my government.  I was, I want to be  exemplary citizen and even though my heart 
I felt wasn 't right, but I felt this co untry wa
s good to me and I would never speak out 

about this, my government Un
ited States, no matter what. 
Q: You were also here during th e civil ri
ghts movement and the women's movement.  
Did you as a survivor have any th
oughts on those experiences?   
A: Yes.  Definitely.  Civil rights movement, 
I had bad experience because when I came  to 
this country I came to 
the country of the free.  I came 
to the people's  drugstore and th e 
counter, I could sit down, have a cup of coffee
; the black man next to me could only have 
to go.  I really questioned it and I really felt 
bad.  Abso lutely every--just like me, I always 
felt should have a place in the sun, so other 
people should have a place in the sun.  I'm 
really, absolutely I'm g lad th
e way things turned out that 
everybody gets more and more

rights.  As long as it's not being abused th
en everybody shou
ld have the right to choose, 
the right to vote, and that's
 the only way intelligent civili
zed people sh
ould go.   
Q: I'm going to pause now and change a tape.   
  (Pause to change tape) 

  [Technicalcomments] 

Q: I wanted to ask you what else has been of
 interest or concern to you in  your years in 
this country, besides the wars and social movements that we discussed.  Is there anything 
else that sticks in your mind that wa
s of particular interest to you?   
A: Really, particular interest to me is Israel
.  I would like to see th
e day, literal daywhen 
Israel will be in peace.   Alth
ough I love this country , I am pa
rt of this country, Israel is 
also part of me, and all I go thro ugh, all the pain
, all the death, I feel 
it.  I--that's actually 
my favorite charity.  I support 
them in every way I can beca
use my friends, some family 
still live there, and they need some peace t
oo, and I feel for them
. Interested in this 
country?  Yes, I am interested make sure
 that something like th
at would never happen 
again.  There's all kinds of denials in this co
untry and I want to make
 sure and that's  the 
reason I feel that somebody up 
there wanted me to live to be 
the eyewitness.  I work as a 
volunteer at the Holocaust Museum.  I talk to
 people, let them touch me.  It mak es so 
mu ch impression.  I tell the people who come, 
especially young peopl
e, to the Holocaust 
Museum, and I am a survivor of the Ho locaust, 
I tell them what I have seen, what I have 
heard, all the truths, and they some day, afte
r I will be gone, they 
will still remember th ey 
spoke to a Holo caust survivor who had been  to
 hell and back.  I, I really feel th at I, by 
doing so , speak to ch ildren, wo
rk at the museum.  I do it not
 only service for the Jewish 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  32 
people, service for all mankind 
that something like this should
 not happen not 
only to the 
Jewish people and the others, I really feel 
whatever any kind genocide being committed 
all over the world, I feel it personally.  When I 
read the paper I don't 
just turn the page, I 
feel the pain.  I understand wh at's  going on. 
 And I'm very mu ch concerned, very mu ch 
concerned what's going on in 
Ru ssia.  I am afraid because people are hungry, things are 
unjust for them, and they might turn again,
 became again some ki
nd of communist or 
whatever, fascist power come to power and th
en we start all over again.  I'm concerned 
about the whole world what's 
going on.  I read the paper 
and I'm interested what's 
happening in this wo rld.  And I hope thatpeople, especially I'm 
concerned what's going 
on with the weapons of mass 
destruction.  I am afraid some crazy people some day, 
they'll be glad to jump in 
the grave knowing they take a 
million people with them.  I 
would like to see ban all these weapons of mass 
destruction.  Otherwise it's no future for, 
not my children, for children other people.   
Q: Have you experienced any anti-
Semitism in this country?   
A: Yes, I have experienced some anti-Sem
itism in this countr
y.  When I work on 
construction those people don't know I was Je
wish and they would, you know, point out 
to me various jokes.  I used to get fired. 
 When  you come in on construction you are the 
last man to go.  I wasn't the last man to
 go, I was fired because I was Jewish.   
I also own some property and 
of course all my tenants know I am Jewish.  And I one 
mo st exemplary landlord because mo stly people 
invite me, come in, have a glass of wine, 
so.  But sometimes something happen, like on
e time electric motor 
would burn up with 
cinder and the air conditioning stopped wo rk. 
 When the inspector 
came in the woman 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  33 
said, "That damn ed Jew, he don't take care."  
So I got angry at the in
spector.  I said, "You 
should have come check
ed with  me, why, why do all thes
e things happen, before you go 
upstairs and check the apartmen
t room that is 90 degrees he
at.  You should come down, 
I'll show you that the whole wiring and the 
whole motor burnt to a 
cinder." Well, the one 
lady, one of my tenants, heard the woman, you
 know, giving her anti-Semitic remark, so I 
wrote her a letter, I appreciate tenants and I am
 going to put her out.  So she wrote me a 
letter apologizing.  I still kept the letter.  And 
she asked me what can she do.  I said, "If 
you want to I would like you to make a do
nation to  my  synagogue
."  And I took that 
check and I went to my  synagogue and I stampe
d Israel from the side, 
on the front, on the 
back.  When she gets that ch
eck back that she knew that sh
e gave donation to  the Jewish 
synagogue to Jewish causes.  So
 it is a lot of anti-Semitism in
 this country.  Of course it 
is.  It is a great country but there are all kinds
 of fish in the water.  But we want to make 
sure and be always on guard  so
 something like this couldn't happen in this country, too, 
that should not happen.   
Q: How has the Holocaust experience influenced
 some of the choices that you have made 
over the years?   
A: The Holocaust influen
ced me in a lot of ways.  I want-- fi
rst of all, the things I used to 
have in my  home, in my  gran dparents' home, 
in my great grandparen
ts' home, when  I go 
to Israel, w h en I have seen the picture from th
e Western Wall, I want to have one.  When 
I have seen silver candelabra like my  great gra
ndfather had, I want to have one.  I grasp 
these things what I lost.  I just
 want to bring th em back to lif
e, bring them to my home.   

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  34 
Also, I want to give my children what I couldn'
t--I could not be a doctor.  I want to--I am 
so proud that I gave them education.  ____
____+ my experiences.  I want to give my 
children not the good things in life, the e
ducation to become so
mebody, wh ich I could 
never attain when  I was young.  Otherwise,
 you know, I'll try to build a home life like I 
knew, respect to my  wife, respect to my  child
ren, respect to everybody else, that taught 
me, that the Holocaust taught me a lot of thi
ngs, that people really 
should be good to one 
another and to respect each other.  Another th
ing, I came from a relig ious home.  During 
the war what I have seen I really question if
 there is a god.  Bu t then  wh en you have a 
family you want to give your fami ly some 
kind of soul.  You got the sense of the 
longings.  You are afraid something, you 
know, you are not, just can't go out and kill 
another, you are accounted for, in this way you
 are accounted for something higher.  So 
you gave--we had a, not a tradition at home, 
but Frid ay night Sh abbos dinner, early to 
synagogue, to give the children that sense of
 belonging, and they  do
 the same thing their 
own home.  So that's  what 
the Holocaust taught me.   
Q: What has been your best surprise or 
your biggest disappointment about life in 
America?   
A: Well, I'm not really disappointed in life in
 America because you got, you are master of 
your own destiny.  You make your own bed, yo
u sleep in it.  I really like living in this 
country.  I feel great.  I don't have really 
any big disappointments. 
 Some times I'v e--the 
only small disappointment, the trials were held, 
the jury trials, they 
really, the jurors are 
not voting with their heart, they are voting as
 a group of people just, I'm afraid it's not 
going to be bringing justice to 
this country.  Politic
ally also, it's, I th
ink that president 

Interview with William
 Luksenburg  35 
should not have millions for th
is position to become a presiden
t.  A small man or a poor 
man cannot become president.  
I would like to see that chan
ge.  And otherw ise I like the 
rights, individual rights for individual people 
and especially as a Je
wish person we enjoy 
very much rights and freedom in this country.   
Q: What would you yet like to accomplish?   

A: I would like to win a mill
ion dollars because I would lik
e to have--when I went to 
Brandeis and I walk ed with my  wife I said, 
you know, some day if I made a lot of money 
I would like to donate, have one of those bu
ildings in my name.  I w ould like to leave 
some kind of real me mento that the Luksen
burgs was walking on th
is earth and left 
something behind.   

Q: Is there anything you would like to add be
fore we conclude, anything that we haven't 
talked about that you wo
uld like to mention?   
A: I cannot and will not understand why the 
whole world stood still and allow such a 
horrible crime to commit on men, women, child
ren.  Up to now I cannot understand why 
the whole earth stood still.  And I have sl
eepless nights and a hard time because I cannot 

forget the way my parent
s went to murder.   
Q: I thank you for interviewing with me today.  And this will conclude the interview with 

William Luksenburg.
