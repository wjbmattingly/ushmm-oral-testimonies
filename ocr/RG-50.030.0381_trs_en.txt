Q: When di d you st

Bundi st Li br ary?  
A: Oh, I was still young, you know
, I was still young. I

Q: And you wo rked

A: Yes , a  fe w yea r s I  wa s wor kin g t h er

Q: You  were ? 

A: Oh, yes , I  was  going t o t he li brar y. 

Q: And wher e di d, where did the t w

A: Oh, wit h his par ent s. The y ha d a s i x-room apa r
t me nt, you know. The y we
r e teac her s, and he a nd 
I was al wa ys  hearing of that, wor king as a nurse , and they ha d six rooms a nd the y ga ve  us the best  

room. And I wa s wo rkin
g, t here  was  a mai d, I di dn™ t ha

Q: So t hey were fair
ly well off, I gather? 
A: Yo u kn o w, t hey wer e n™t rich b ut t hey were t w
o teac hers , you know, two teac hers . She was once , 
not once, but  she  was up t o
 the end, t h e Pr esi dent  of t he Teacher
s™ Uni on. She wa s very active , a l so 
Bundi st, als o Bundi st, you know. Th
ey di dn™t  s pea k Yiddis h at  all .
 Michal didn™t know Yi ddis h  
until was 21, he started 
to learn by himself to 
r ead. The y s poke Pol i sh 
all the time, and so was 
Ge nia . But  he lear ne d by hi msel f. Wh
en he has  21, he  sai d
, ﬁThat™s enough.ﬂ It™s
 interesting that th e 
leader s, the Bundi st l eaders, th
e  children never spoke  Yiddish. Even
 the  Er lich and Art hur (ph), you 
know who they are, they 
were the great leaders of
 the Bund, both of th
em were killed by the  
Russia ns dur ing t he war , in 1941. 
Art hur ( ph) wa s  an e ngi neer , a
nd Erlic h, his t wo sons , wer e her e. 
Vict or ( ph), he i s a pr ofessor  at  Yale, and t he chil
dren never  s poke Yi ddi s h. It
 was very interesting. 
Of c our se , t hey we re se nt to t he bes t  school s, t o
 gimnazjums, this and that
. So this is why Michal  
didn™t speak Yiddish at all.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
16 
 
 
01: 35: 57 

 

And he never even spoke Yiddish b
ecause he was afraid that he w
ill, that he, that
 he will make 
mis t akes a nd he didn™t want t o ma ke any mista kes
, s o but he c oul d rea d. In
 the end, he  coul d re ad . 
In t he end, he c oul d re ad. 

Q: Di d you s o meti me s s p eak 
Yiddish bet wee n eac h other?  
A: Mic hal a nd I?  No, no, ne ver . I likely s poke t o
  -- started to spe ak Ire ne Polis h, you know, not  
Yiddish, she didn™t know 
a wor d o f Yid dis h.  S he  st
arte d t o le arn Yi ddi sh he
re in t he States, yeah , 
not be fore . Bec ause in Swe den, als o, you know -- I™ m Swedi sh and Polis h. Thi s is how we s poke to 

[i naudible].  

Q: So what i s ha ppe ning in your li fe between 19
37 and 1939?  Are t he t wo 
of you t hinki ng a bout the  
war  poss ibl y  comi ng ther e, or - -  
A: We  wa nt ed t o co me, 1939 wa s th
e Worl d Fair  in the States and we
 intended to come at that time . 
But, we were a little late
 beca use  he had a n aunt here, too. Hi s 
mother ™s sist er. One was in Paris and  
the other one was here . And we inte nde d to come to
 the Worlds™ Fair, it star
ted in September, an d 
he for some  reas ons couldn™t ma ke
 i t, you know. I don™t know i f 
it was exa ms or re gistrati on or  
whatever it was, becaus
e he finished Politechni
kum in 1939. B
ecause he was also working, you 
know, with being marri e d is, is 
t o s upport a wi fe. So, he -- we 
intended to come but fo r some 
reason, we wer e late . I f  we woul
d have come at that ti me, he 
woul dn™ t  be de ad, you know?  He  
wo uld stay here. Bu
t  we wer e  lat e .  
Q: Were  you inte ndi ng t o  come  t o
 t he Uni ted States just for th
e  Worlds™ Fai r , j ust a vac ati on?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
17 
 
A: J ust for, he would ne ver le
a ve , you know, he  had t o fight, 
fight for a  better Pol a nd, for t he 
righte ous, you know, t hos e ki nds  of things . He  woul
d ne ver l ea ve Pol and at that ti me , t hi nki ng, you  
know, what  happened at  that t i m
e. He  woul d ne ver  lea ve Poland. 
Q: So then the wa r st arts, yeah? 
A: Then the war starts, yes. 

Q: What is  t hat li ke?  Wh at™s t he  be
gi nni ng like  for you 
and your fa mily?  
A: It was tragic. Meanwhile, you kn
ow, my sister s  got marrie d and we
re out  of the house , Ge nia had  
a marvelous  hus ba nd, Dubnik
ow, a n d the y had a  son, M ajus ,  b
eca use  he wa s born, in, in, in t he  
mont h of Ma y s o t he y c al l ed hi m Maj us, 
you se e. I t  was n™t r eligious  busi nes s.  
 

01: 39: 01 

 

The n An ka wa s marrie d also , to B
achrach, a marvelous man,
 he just die d 90, be ing 90 years ol d. He  
wa s writi ng to the end of his day, thi s  was Bac hra ch. And the y had a daught

through Sha nghai, c a me to the Stat

Rose nfeld; he wa s a lawyer , a 
Co mmunist, and also ma rvel
ous man. So  well educated, you know
?  We al wa ys ha d, as  muc h a s I 
know lit erat ure, we al wa ys ha d s o
me  kind of, you know, ga me s. I 
alwa ys, you know, lost. He wa s 
always on top of ever yt hi ng. All ki nds of literat u
r e  and mar ve l ous man. A
nd my br other, who wa s 
also marri ed and had a  s on, be fo
r e t he war. So, ever
ybody wa s re ally out,
 you know. An d I was 
married, so this is when the wa
r broke out. Was only my  young, yo
ungest sister with my  mo ther.  
Q: S o --  

A: So Œ Kr ysia, she c alle d her , little Kr ysia . But 
ever ybody t ook care of 
the househol d. And it so 
happe ns that  on the se ve nth or ei ght h of Se pte m be
r, it was an order by t he mayor, their Warsa w  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
18 
 
mayor, that all th
e men who were still at the 
age of military should get out
 of the city because the 
Ger ma ns we re coming very close and they™ ll take 
all the me n, so better you get out to the east , to 
Russia. The east side of Poland 
because maybe still the 
Poland will win the wa
r with the Germans. 
And so did Michal a nd all the 
husbands. Only the oldest one, 
Genia a n d Dubnikow, they we nt  
toget her;  the y di dn™t  lea ve. Anka st a yed and Gut a 
stayed and I stayed and 
all of them left. They 
we nt, Mic ha l  le ft with hi s t wo fr
i ends . Jer zy Li psz yc was  home , he  
was students, they we re stude nts 
studying together  in University. 
An d Mietek  Kat o wic z  di ed , b ut I me
t J erz y when I  we nt with Ire ne  
to Poland, he came  up. 

 

01: 42: 03 

 

They all left , they were all married
, but they all left , left  their wives.
 The y we nt t o the e ast si de an d 
aft er a few weeks, maybe a month,
 ma y ha ve been si x wee ks, I don™t know, t he y al l ca me bac k.  
Mietek  Kat o wic z ™s wi fe wa s pr eg na

I think that Jerzy stay

still in London -- he got, his fathe r was a doc tor 
a nd he wa s very well off, you know, some ki nd of  

cont act he had but t he n he c a me ba

w weeks, t hey came 
ba ck. Be sides , Ge nia  
did not  come ba ck, Bac hrac h di dn

my  sister and the baby somehow. 
People wer e traveli ng bac k and forth, you know, 
t hrough the border s bet w e en Rus sia and Ge r many,  
bac k a nd for t h. So Anka  left t o 
Vil na,  the y were i n Vil na.  Gen i a was  in  Do bno , this  wa s Ukr a ini a n ,  

and the n Gut a le ft wit h Buzie k, so it  wa s her hus b
and, al so t o t he Ukraine.
 An d I sta yed
, I wa s there  
and Krysia had a boyfriend and she 
also left. So when Michal came  
back, I took my  
mo ther to our 
house hol d a nd we  sta ye d toget her. Th
at was a very tragic situation at
 t hat ti me . I  was sick. Fir st o f 
all, t hey bombarded Warsaw, I wa
s so scared because Michal wasn
™t t h ere and we went i nto the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381

cellars and I  was so scared
 to death. I got fever, 
I didn™t  know what™s  ha ppening a nd M ichal  was n™ t  
there. It was very scar y! Then su
ddenly he came back; 
t hey de cide d the y c annot lea ve t he wives a nd  
they c a me back. And si nce the n, a nd 
then wa s, you know, a
nd then a fter a whi l e I got pregnant a nd -
- 
Q: What happened? 

A: And the n  also we had to move
 from our  apart me nt t o t he ghett o.
 So, at that time I wa s already 
very si ck and I  was  ou
t of action. I wa s Œ 
 

01: 45: 00 

 

Q: Wh at were you sick from?  

A: Thyr oi d because my eyes at th
at ti me became per manent, per man
ent , you know, I never had thi s  
kind of, thi s wa s with t he  sicknes s. M y he art, I wa

sick. But this was already  
aft er I r ene was bor n. 

Q: But you move d t o 
t he  ghetto in 1940?  
A: No, this was alread
y later, a little bit, 
‚42, end of ‚40 or 
‚41, something like 
-- because they did it 
in parts, you know. Th ere was a 
s ma ll ghetto, a big ghe

out two rooms, it wa s a 
one r oom l at er but divi de d int o two rooms over t he r

lived together. 

Q: So now, wh o was together? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381

A: My mother-in-law, my fa ther-i

ghetto. What are peopl e tal king 
about? What kind of things? 
A: It was a t r e mendous s hoc k to
 ever ybody because the Ge

streets, they were 
killing just like tha t . They were te ar ing beards

They wer e coming at

01: 38: 01 
 
Before they started to take them
 t o conce ntrati on c a mps . All ki nd of wor k. I t  was unbeli eva ble what  
wa s going on in the street

either camp or that, and 
he committed suicide. Others
 stayed, but then Jewish 
Police came. 
It was, it  
wa s a terribl e thing. You can™t even imagine what 
was  going on. And we didn

my mother-in-law was selling an

It was a tremendous  tragedy,  
tragedy, completely tragic. And the

Q: Rose, before we start with after you came out 
of the hospital, July 20th or 21st 1942, I wanted 
to ask you some  questions about that. 

A: Okay. 

Q: Wa s there an argument in your family about
 whether you should learn the Polish language 
and where you should learn it? 

A: It wasn™t a ma tter of learning my Polish lang
uages, it came naturally fr om the mo me nt I was 
born and raised, we spoke Polish, you know. It 
was the parents spoke Yiddish. But the ma in, 
really, conversations was among us, it was always 
in Polish. And when I went to school, I was 
suppose to go to school, there was a, ther
e was a question. Should I go to a Folkshule,
10
 which 
was in Yiddish, or should I go to a public school in
 Polish? And my sister, the oldest one, was a 
teacher herself. Said, absolutely to the Polis
h school, because I don™t want her to go into the 
street and be afraid that some body™s going to be
at her up when she speaks Yiddish. And this was 
the general atmosphere, you know. But some  pe opl
e, the Folkshule was very popular among the 
workers, you know, the Bundists particular. Ther
e was also the Poale Zion schools in Yiddish. 
Nellie™s (ph) mother was the teacher in the Poale 
Zion, but in my fa mily they said, ﬁAbsolutely,ﬂ 
my sister said, the oldest one
, ﬁAbsolutely not.ﬂ A
nd my mother and father, you know, went 
along with my sister, you know. She was a teach
er, she knew what™s going on in the, in the 
schools and so on, and I went to a public sc
hool in Polish. Because this was if you speak 

Yiddish, you know, you are always in risk. And they
 didn™t want me  to have this as a ma in 
language.

Q: When, when you were working in the library, you 
were given an assignme nt to create a list of 
100 books. Could you tell us that story? 
A: Yes. As I told you before, I was catalogi ng, and, you know, putting in categories di fferent 

books. And the workers came and, and always ask, ﬁCould you give me  a good book, some thing 

to read?ﬂ And when I spoke to the director of 
the library, he said to me , ﬁRozka, why won™t you 
write out a list of 100 books so when the people co
me  in and want to take a book out, they could 
see the list, what they should take.ﬂ  

 

02:04:09 

 
And I decided to do that. So, I put down a list of 103 books I know exactly, from different 
categories, categories and countri
es. And there was the Scandina
vian countries and American 
literature and, of course, Polish l
iterature, French, all kind. Everyt hing in translation, of course, 
into Polish, not in the original languages. 
So I put down a list of 103 books, and Russian 
literature was a very, very modern at the time
, to read the Russian, the Russian literature 
translated into Polish. And I went to Mrs.
 Dobnow. Erlich. Dobnow was the daughter of the 
fa mous historian Dubnow, wrote the history of 
the Jews. And she was herself a poet. She was 
writing poetry in still Russian and knew excellent 
Polish literature --  altogether a very intelligent 
and very well educated. His two sons were prof
essors, one of Columbia and the one is who 
passed away and the one is in Yale. And she was 
there, I ma de an appointme nt with her, and I 
said, ﬁMrs. Dubnow, I want to come and have y
our opinion,ﬂ because I didn™t want  to rely on 
myself, that this is right. So 
I left with her the list of 100 books 
and she studied it. Then she, I 
called her, and she said, ﬁ Would you come  up?  Le
t™s have a discussion about it.ﬂ And there she 
accepted the 100 books, but one which was called, 
Cztowiek Zmienia S™ku™re.

would be ﬁa person changes his skin.ﬂ It means th
at becomi ng Œ changing his ideas, his ideology. 
This is what it means, that a person changes his sk
in. She didn™t want to 
put it in. She didn™t want 
Œ she was a little bit, you know– She was a Bundi
st, but she didn™t want
 to start with the 
Communists. This was my feeling 
at that time , as young as I was. 
And I felt it should be there. 
And we had a big discussion about 
it. And she told me , "If you feel
 so strongly about it, let™s 
leave it.ﬂ It was written by Bruno Jasienski, wh
o was a Communist once and he -- who believe d 
in Christ that have to help people and so on. 
The funniest this was when I came to the United 
States, and I came to visit her, so she says to me , 
 ﬁIf you feel so strongly 
about it, let's leave it.ﬂ 
The funniest thing was when I came to the United St
ates and I came to visit her. So she says to 
me , ﬁRozka, I reme mber how you argued with me
 about that book, that we  had the discussion 
about that book.ﬂ I was beside myself. How c
ould she reme mber such a stupid thing and the 

khutspe
12
 of me , you know, to argue with her when she 
says let's take it out. I had three other 
books in case, but this was -- I 
was glad that she reme mbered. 
Q: So you did leave it in? 

A: True, yeah. She says, ﬁIf you feel so strong
ly about it.ﬂ She let me  in [indecipherable]. 
Nothing would happen, but she wanted to ma ke
 her point and -- and 
I -- I stood up, you know, by 
that. 

Q: I wanted to ask you a couple 
of questions about Mi
chal, this is before the war, and your 
relationships. You -- you used to 
help him with his home work? 
A: You see, they have projects for their exams, to make a project -- he wa
s an engineer. And they 

ma de -- a mechanical engineer, you 
know. They used to ma ke all kind of machines and what is it 
called, what they have at when they build, you kn
ow the -- the buildings 
and they have the big
 
Q: A crane? 

A: The cranes, yeah. The cranes, you know. All ki
nd of things which is connected with force, 
with you know, pressure, so on, so on. And he used to ma ke on big paper, he used to ma ke all

this kind of drawings. But he ma de
 it in pencil and this had to be 
done in -- in -- in ink. So when 
he did it -- I was very scrupulous, you know, ve
ry always detailed. So he said, ﬁWhy don't you 
do it in ink, because I have to do, I ha ve to study 
for my exa m,ﬂ or some thing like that. And I did 
it. So I was working very diligently and very a
ccurately and he was very happy about it, he had 
help. Other students, who had to work, you know
, ma ke a living, they had to give it to 
some body, you know. And it-interesting, they were
 called, you know how?  Negroes, ﬁmurzynﬂ 
in Polish. Because murzyn, murzynowác, it means, you 
know, to do it in bl ack. This is what they 
called it. And they had to pay for that, a lot of
 money. But I was -- I wasn't  paid. But I helped 
him a lot you know, in that. 

Q: Rose, I asked you when you -- when you were 
growing up, whether you had Polish friends, or 
whether you were involved in any way and you said
 no. But, was there a ch
ange in your life in 
that respect when you met Michal? 

A: Oh, yes, because Michal was already -- you know
, he went at that time to the university and 
he belonged you know, to the -- to the Bund and they
 had a very close relationship wi th the PPS, 
this is Polska  Partia Socjalistyczna.
13
 This is like the Bund in Je
w- in, you know, the Jewish. And 
this is the Polska, this Polish party, Socjalisty
czna. And over there, there was also a sport club 
called Skra,
14
 where you know, the Jutrznia and Skra used
 to meet. And Gina, Michal's sister, 
had a lot of friends because she was also an athlete,
 Gina, in this sport club in Jutrznia and they 
me t -- they had all kind of, you know, sport game s 
together. And she had very close friends in 

the Polish club. And a mong them was one Marysia 
Sawicka, who was a tremendous help to us 
later on in the -- on the Aryan side
 in the, you know, when we we
nt out. And Michal also had a 
lot of friends there and he had a contact la
ter on, when he was going out from the ghetto, you 
know, for ammunition and so on, was the Polish fr
iend from t he pepperess. So it wasn't  exact -- 

at my age at that time, and my contacts wasn't  th
e same  as theirs were. And then we were all, you 
know, we had the very good contact with 
them and they helped us tremendously.

Q: W- We re you surprised at his -- 
A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: Not at all, no. Because we always felt that
 you know, we have to be brothers, whoever you 

are. Even wa s a song about it, black and white
, you know, all kind of colors, we should be 
brothers. No, absolutely not. This was 
our idea, you know, [indecipherable] so. 
Q: So in -- not only because it helped you, but 
you thought it was important
 that you were be -- 
able to have this kind this relationship? 

A: Of course, yeah. Of course. And frankly, you 
know, also when I went to the Aryan side, I 
cont-I contacted a woma n whom I knew, a Polis
h woma n and asked her, you know, where to go, 
where to be and she helped us also. And there 
was a place -- friend of Wnorowska, she was a 
seamstress and we used to work there and we used to meet there and even Vladka you know, was 

comi ng there also. A lot of people. This was 
my - -  this was my, you know, contribution, this 

address. Sama rch (ph) was a ma rvelous person. 
No, on the contrary. Bu
t at -- as a child, you 
know, as a youngster, I didn't have the contact wi
th them. But it wasn't  that -- that I would 
separate. 

Q: It was just  -- it just was coinci dental then? 

A: Coincident, that's  right, yeah, absolutely. 

Q: Okay.  When, when we ended the last ta
pe, we ended where you were taken out of the 
hospital by Gina and Michal be-becaus
e there was going to be an Aktion
15
 and it was the huge 
deportat -- the beginning of the huge deportations. 

A: Yes. 

Q: We re you still very sick when they took you? 

A: No, I was better already. No, I could walk, yo
u know, I could walk. It was still, you know, I 
was very weak, but I could walk and I -- not that
 I could be on my own, but I could walk and I

could do certain things. But the ra
ids were constantly terrible. 
And one of the 
raids, you know, 
we all would have to come  down. M i
chal got some  kind of a n Answeiss.
16
 Know what 's an 
Answeiss?  It is some  kind of a permi t  from a certa
in place. This is through the Judenrat, we had 
some body t here, you know and he got it that he's  wo
rking here and there, which wasn't true. He 
wasn't  working there, but that he's  working, he is
 needed as engineer and so on. So -- so we all 
had to go down and my in-laws and there was her 
sister also, Guta Schulma n (ph), which I said 
and my mother, myself and Irene, holding her, 
and Michal. We all were
 standing in the court 
there, but they said, who has Answeiss could ta
ke out his wife , or a child, you know, whatever it 
is. And Michal approached one of these and they 
let me  out with Irene and the rest went -- went 
to the Umschlagplatz and this was my -- my mot h
er was standing with me and I knew this is the 
end. I knew this is the end. It was. And we went b
ack upstairs with Irene. Gina wasn't  there. Gina 
was very often, you know, in the Umschlagplatz 
going with her uniform as a nurse, smuggling 
out people, you know, whom she knew. She wasn't  th
ere. And then when she f-found out that our 
area was, you know, raided, she came running an
d she found us. She was beside herself, you 
know, her parents were gone and my mother was gone. 

Q: Rose, did you know then where they were going? 

A: We  knew already. 

Q: You did? 

A: Because there was, yeah. There wa s a friendof ours, Frydrych, Zygmunt Frydrych. He went 

with the train, you know, he got attached to the 
train some how and he went up to Treblinka. And 
he saw what's happening and he came back with
 this, you know, news that everybody's being 
gassed over there. He knew all right. So we 
knew already. The 22nd of July, we knew already 
what it is. There were time s when they were 
promising, you know, before, that we'll give you a  
few pounds of bread and then t -- some thing, sugar, 
or whatever it is and to come , you know, to 
                     
16
 Permit (German).

another place and so the people went for it, th
ey were hungry and they went for that. But we 
knew already. 
Q: Had -- had you all heard about 
the Idzodz (ph) group when, in 1941, when they -- when they 
started the war against Russia?  That they were
 -- there were ma ss shootings, did you hear about 
that? 

A: Of course, we knew already, we kne
w about it, yeah. We  knew about it. 
Q: So you knew this was all a d
eath sentence in some  way? 
A: Oh, we knew, yeah, we knew. And then was th
e other time, after that
 -- I was only with -- 
with Michal, you know, Gina and -- and the baby. That
's it. Another raid of the building and they 

were running -- the Jewish policema n, they were
 running up the -- to look
 into the apartments, 
whether some body was hidden or not. And they w
ould take down, because if still br ing people, 
you know, his family, it will be sa ved. This is how they brought the people. And we heard it will 

be decided not to go down, Michal, and to keep 
Irene quiet, you know. We went in the very far 
corner of the apartment, they cannot see us a
nd we left the doors ope
n, so they'll see that 
nobody's -- think that nobody's there. And we hear
d them running up -- there was another floor, 

running up and down and opening the doors and h
eaved around, looked in and I was keeping 
Irene on a table, dressed. We  were all dressed 
to go. I was keeping her on the table and pushing 
into her mouth, candies, so she 
cannot ta -- she cannot
 scream, she cannot talk, she cannot do 
anything. And I was pushing, you know, and pushing in 
-- into-- into that 
-- in that, her mouth. 
And she didn't -- not a sound. And they 
just glanced in and -- and went. 

Q: They didn't  see anything? 

A: No, they didn't see us, of course not. And th
e -- Genia, heard again that. She came in and you 
know, she was frantic. She star
ted to cry, it's  [inaudible]. 
Q: It must have been terrifying. 

A: There is no expression for that. And then -- 
they know, when we deci
ded -- I'll tell you, this 
came a point when I couldn't ma ke any more d
ecisions. I didn't have the strength. Michal was 
doing all the decisions, you know, all the time . I c
ouldn't do that. And it wa s a raid. This was the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
32 
 
last time. And there were columns going the stre
et and we had to go, it wa s -- it was the column, 
you know. We couldn't already get out. And there wa
s a wide street ther
e, Zame nhoff Street, 
going to the Umschlagplatz. And there was one 
Je wish militia ma n, who was once in the Bund, I 
knew him too, Michal knew him, I 
knew him. And we were in th
e back, and he came over to us, 
he was watching that nobody should escape. He cam
e over to us and said, ﬁMichal, go to the 
front, to the very front and I'll watch.ﬂ And so
me how, you know, he got to the very -- Michal 
was carrying Irene and I was wa
lking, you know -- hardly walking, 
but walking. And we came t o 
--  and Michal told me , ﬁ You see on that corner, 
that Kupieka Street, th
ere is a tremendous,ﬂ oh, 
what's called?  Kiosk, a wi -- a ra
 -- a round one, but very wide. He 
said, ﬁ When we come to that 
kiosk,ﬂ I was the first one at the 
sidewalk, ﬁyou go to the right.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁI'm a frﬂ -- in the back, 
the Germans were standing and shooting whoe
ver would move, you know, they shoot. I said, 
ﬁMichal, I cannot do that.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou're goi
ng to do that.ﬂ And he gave me , when we came 
to the corner, he gave me  such a push and I went
 to the front of that kiosk, because it wa s hidden 

a little bit, you know, for the co
lumn  and then Michal came with the baby. And we 'r e standing, 
until everybody pass by. It's hard to describe. When
 they pass by, we cross the st reet and there 
was an empt y building already. Everything was op
en. And we hid there for awhile. Then we 
passed, you know, we came home, back. But this 
was already about two blocks from the 
Umschlagplatz, we go. But if he wouldn't the -- but
 he ma de all the deci
sions at that time , I 
couldn't any more. And then he decided that we go
ing out, after that. And that we'r e going to our 
ex-mate, who was living in Prague. This is 
the vistalna, divided you know, Prague like Bronx, 
let's say, in Manhattan. And she live in there and 
she was like, you know, in French they have the 
concierge. So she was taking care of the bui
ldings, cleaning and everything. And she knew 
everybody who come s in and who goes. She had 
no husband, she has a daughter. But we decided 
to go there. And how we  went th
ere, we went with the so-calle
d platzufka (ph). Platzufka was 
they were collecting people for work in differe
nt directions, comi ng out
 of the ghetto, going to 
that pl ace and then comi ng back. So we took the 
baby, and you could take  the baby that time , to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
33 
 
different places to work. And we
 went out and on the other side
, on the Aryan side, we stepped 
again, away from the column in a certain mo ment. 
Q: And did he pick the mome nt? 

A: Always. I never did anything. I wa s a very passi
ve at that time. I had the baby, I was thinking 
about the baby, I wasn't  too well and -- and so on. He
 always picked this. He always ma de all the 

decis -- since that mo me nt, he ma de always the --
 the -- all -- all the decisions. And -- and we got 

-- we got into a streetcar and went there. When
 she looked at us, she paled -- she was pale. She 
was afraid, you know, went there. And we told he
r that it's  only for a few days until we find 
some thing. Didn't have any papers, nothing. We  t
ook off all the armbands and this is how we 
did. In the column, as we were ma rching, we took off the -- the -- the bands, you know and -- 

and this is how we got there. So she said th
at she'll find, you know -- he was running around with 

different, you know, paper, no paper and said, ﬁI'll ge
t a birth certificate of he
r sister,ﬂ who is in 
Germany, working for the Germans, she was take
n by the Germans. So as there is no reason, you 
know, she wasn't  afraid, she went over there. It
 was in a -- it was a country there, you know, a 

village called Gleboczyce and she got me  the paper 
ther e and she said that I can go ther e, to this, 
you know, village and I can stay with so and so. Th
e name  of that peasant was Patoka, a tall, old 
ma n, gray. She was very vivacious with her son 
and I went there with 
Irene, I stayed. Michal 
took me  there and he left for Wa rsaw, he couldn'
t stay there, Michal couldn't stay there, he 
shouldn't have, because the less people the be tter. 
And I was staying there for awhile, this is how 
we got out on the Aryan side. I wa
s st aying there for -- for awhile. 
Q: How did you get there, did you walk? 

A: No, by train. 

Q: By train? 

A: Yeah, was all a risk. This is
 all a risk, you know. Every -- 
Q: Did Michal -- did Michal ha
ve papers now too, or not? 
A: Not yet. 

Q: Not yet. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381

A: Not yet, yeah. He had the Answeiss, you know, 
that he is working. This was so he looked as 
an Aryan, so there was no problems and -- no pr
oblem, was always a problem. Then one time, 
you know, one of the workers from his factory me t 
him in the street, they said, ﬁMr. engineer, 
what are you doing here? ﬂ  You know, he knew that 
he is Jewish. And he gave him shelter later 
on, he was selate (ph). This is another story. Bu
t this is how we got in
to the country, you know, 
with Irene, for a few days, you know. We 'd worked there for a few weeks. And
 
Q: How wer e  you at that time, during those fe
w weeks?  We re -- did Michal come  back and 

forth? 

A: Yes, yes, he came back for -- back and forth, yeah.  

Q: Every few days, or? 

A: No, for a week, some t hing like that, he had fo
r a week, but never, you k
now, he could, he said 
-- he had things to do also, you know
 in -- in Wa rsaw. Preparing wh
atever -- he was very active 
with the -- with the fi
ghting organization, you know. He wa s ve
ry fight -- he was very active 
there. 

Q: Did you know what he was doing at that time? 
A: Not exactly, not exactly. I knew that he is 
involved, but not exactly, he didn't tell me , you 
know. So over there, how -- it was interesting. Th
ey loved Irene, the little baby and whenever -- 
he some ti me s took her on his knee -- the -- the pe
asant, Mr. Patoka took -- took her on her knee 
and they were eating like, potato balls, you 
know, ma de. Take ma tzo balls, you know potato 
balls. So he took a piece into his mouth, he ma de it 
soft and gave it to her. I was looking at it and 
I was dying, you know. But, didn't say a word about 
it. There was a little wooden thing for them 
to give food to the -- to the pigs
, they brought it in. So I washed 
it, I put in water and I bathed 
Irene. I took her to the fields and 
I -- I could pi ck the, what's calle
d? Peas, the green peas in this, 
I took it out and I gave it. I took 
carrots, I-I grated them, I squeezed
 out juice to ha ve for her, the 
juice the -- the -- the you know, 
the carrot juice, some vitami ns
. And when the -- the wo ma n, the 
peasant, she saw this, she says, ﬁWe give it to
 the pigs, why do you give it to the baby? ﬂ  You 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
35 
 
know, this kind of things, very primitive, but ki
nd. And I think that the soltys, you know what's  
the soltis, the eldest of the vi
llage, who was getting on everything, 
I think that he guessed who I 
am, but he never said anything. But one day, he 
came and he said, ﬁThe Germans are comi ng for 
the boys and girls. It would be good for you to es
cape here from here with the child. I think I 
wrote about it, you read it. Mich
al isn't here, I have no addres
s for Michal. He was one right 
here, one right there, didn't  know what to do. 
I had a few, you know, Polish zlotys, but didn't 
know what to do and I had to go, because if he ca
me  to me  and said it in a nice way, that he 
didn't want me , you know, to -- he knew that I woul
dn't survive with the child. He said I have to 

disappear, I have to disappear. And 
he said, that peasant said there 
is a brother of the -- his wife 
in -- near Tuszcz. Tuszcz is -- was the stati
on where the train stopped for Treblinka, you know. 
Tuszcz, Malkinia and Treblinka, this was the -- 
the route. ﬁHe's a s mith (ph), you know and so 
we can take you there. And maybe until your husband will come, he 'll find you.ﬂ Well, it was 

quite a few miles. I was carrying Irene you know, w
ith the rest of my, of my strengths. He was 
carrying a little package what 
I had, you know, diapers, this. And we ca me there. We l l , they 
were very nice to us because, you know, he says my husband should come , you know and they'll 

take me  away, it's only a ma tter of a few days. 
So she was very nice. But some body pass by from 
the village where I was before, in the Gleb- Gle
boczyce, who said, ﬁShe was there, why is she 
here?  She is probably Jewish.ﬂ Th
is was it. So she came in, the wife and said, ﬁYou cannot stay 
here any more. You have to go.ﬂ And then I 
decided to go to Warsaw
. What do I do?  I don't 
know where, no address, no nothing. And Michal 
wouldn't know where I am. So I said, ﬁOkay, 
tomorrow I'l l  go. You'll take me there to the statio
n and I'll go.ﬂ So then I put Irene to sleep for a 
nap before the trip. Trip supposed to be one o'
clock, two o'clock, I don't reme mber. And she slept 
and I was standing at the window and I wa
s crying. And suddenly I see some body passing by. 
Michal. And I started to run afte
r him, until I came out. He was very fast walking, he didn't know 
anything, you know. And -- and he didn't hear me, 
and he didn't  hear me  s c reaming, ﬁMichal.ﬂ 
So I took a stone, I threw at him. So then he
 turned around, said, ﬁWhat you doing here?ﬂ And I 
told him the whole story. This was a mi racle, co
mplete mi racle. So he came into the apartment 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
36 
 
and then the -- when the smith (ph), you know, he
 said, you know, was talking to him and just 
looking him up and down and he said, ﬁ What do you do? ﬂ And he says, ﬁOh, I am a mechanic, 
you know, this, that.ﬂ So he looks at his hand an
d said, ﬁYou are not a 
mechanic. Doesn't look 
like it.ﬂ And we left. I with Michal, we  left. And he took me  to pref -- you know, we 'r e afraid of 

the train, you know. People were -- this was 
a station where everybody was running here and 

there. So he took me  there, he took me to Wa
rsaw, we took a -- a carriage, you know, a -- s-same  
is standing in Central Park. And we got off abou
t two blocks before it's destination, which was a 
very old -- she was a concierge, that woma n an
d the -- for that buildi
ng where he took me . And 
this was a very narrow, little room where th
ere were already three 
woman living. The -- the 
owner -- the -- the -- the concierg
e with a little boy and I come 
and with Irene and Michal. He 
found it, some body told him, but he lived not far 
away, one block away. He lived there, lived, 

you know, slept. This was the -- the -- the worker 
where he -- whom he me t in the street, what 
are you doing, and he gave him -- said threw he ca
n stay with him. He was very nice too, that 
ma n. He wa s helping for awhile and then he chan
ged his mi nd and started to talk. So we -- we 
went there and I had the little narrow bed for Irene
 and myself and we cont
acted the -- Gina, she 
was working in Wa rsaw. And Gina came, you know
 and what do we do?  We cannot stay here, 
everybody will know. And we decided to separate Ir
ene from us, for her to be safe. Cause we 
knew that we'll perish, this way, another way. 
It's  impossible to live through the whole thing, 
impossible. So let Irene stay, you know, at least. 
And we talked it over with Gina, and Gina said, 
ﬁI have some body.ﬂ And she said, where she gave her exam for nursing -- which was 

international -- the Ministry, she had to go throug
h the Ministry of -- of Health and Education, 
Dr. Zachert. ﬁShe seemed to me  a very nice pe
rson,ﬂ she said, ﬁwhen she -- when she examined 
me. I'll call her.ﬂ She called her, sh
e had already papers and she calle
d her and she said that her -- 
she want to see her, because she want to -- advi
ce from her. She said, ﬁOf course, come .ﬂ A very 
nice person. And she went up and when she told 
her over the phone that she's on the Juzwiak. So 
she said, ﬁYou are not Juzwiak. You are a Gina Kl
epfisz. Please come  in.ﬂ And she told her the 
story, she has a brother and a sister-in-law and 
a baby and sad situation, what can we do?  She 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
37 
 
was also the director of the orphanage, Boduena. 
Priest Boduen was called. 
She says, ﬁI can take 
the baby to the orphanage as an orphan, but not 
 knowing that she's an orphan and she has to be 
left in the street and I'll take her ove
r.ﬂ And here starts
 the whole thing. 
End of Tape 1, Side A 
Beginning of Tape 1, Side B 
Q: And here starts the whole thing
 So, it was a very difficult decision, but we had to do it
 
Let's stop.   
A: All right, let's -- let's stop for a moment. Okay? 

Q: So, we talked with Michal, over and how it wa
s going to -- we have to put a name  on her and 
the Dr. Zachert will wait in the squa re, so and 
so and some body has to come  with Irene. Just 
leave her and go away and she'll pick her up. So 
I said to Michal, ﬁI'm not  going to do that, I 
can't . You have to do it.ﬂ  And Gina was also ther
e, in the square, someplace without Dr. Zachert. 
So he said, ﬁOkay,ﬂ he has to do it. Well, I sa
id good-bye to Irene, he to
ok her and left. I was 
beside myself
 So Michal went there, to the squa re. 
He saw from the far Dr. Zachert and he 
saw Gina, too. And he went to Gi
na, he said, ﬁI'm not going to 
do that, you do it.ﬂ And Gina did 
it. She went close to Dr. Zachert and sat down 
on the bench and said to Irka, ﬁWait here a 
second, I just go for something,ﬂ you know, for wh
at-whatever. ﬁBut sit here.ﬂ And she was 
playing with some thing. So she -- and she left. 
The mo ment she left, Dr. Zachert came and took 
the baby. This is how she got to Boduena. So at 
least I knew that she was going to be safe, over 
there. No raids, you know. 

Q: How old was she, Rose, then? 

A: A year and a half. But she talked already, yo
u know and she was very br
ight and very bright, 
musical, very bright. And she could sing, you 
know, with what we'r e singing, you know, the 

me lodies. And the words, some ti me s. Then Gina 
asked Dr. Sachat what's going to happen to me ?  
So she says, ﬁI have a sister wi
th thr -- with three 
children.ﬂ They are also belong to the, you 
know, the people's party, Partja Ludowa, which were more, you know, li -- Catholics, deep 

Catholics, you know. But -- believed in Christ, th
at have to help people 
and so on. And she said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
38 
 
ﬁMaybe she'll come  there, you know, and be the hous
ekeeper, the ma id.ﬂ And she -- she said that 
we have to -- I -- ﬁShe'll have to be review
ed, to have a few reviews with them,ﬂ you know, my 

Polish, my behavior, my -- of course, a big asticula
tion (ph) all with Jews 
have all together. ﬁAnd 
this would be a good place for her. And they have to look at her, how she looks.ﬂ My eyes were 

already prominent at that time. You'll see anothe
r picture of me  before that, was because of 
thyroid. Again, I imme diately knew what it is, 
you know, when I got up in the morning and my 
eyes were prominent. Never had this kind of 
eyes. So I went there, was there three times, 

interview. Meanwhile, before that I was in th
at room, where I lived, 
you know, where I be -- 
came fr om, with all these women. They were pros
titute and they had all her -- thei r business in 
the streets. They came in the mi ddle of the night
, or whatever. I didn't know about it. I wouldn't 
even think about it, Michal didn't know about it.
 And one evening was very -- what -- was very 
rainy, you know and they couldn't do their business in
 the street, so they 
invited two -- two me n, 
you know. And there was like a curt
ain over their bed and I was s
itting there and reading, what 
do I do?  I wa s reading some thing. Some one said
, ﬁ Why can't  she give?ﬂ ﬁLeave her alone, she 
has a husband.ﬂ ﬁSo, what's  this? ﬂ  But [indecipherabl
e] have to go. So I told them that next time , 
that when they have some guests in their house,
 to let me  know and I w
ill go out. And they did it 
one day, it was very cold or something like th
at. And they said to me , ﬁTa ke only five, 10 
mi nutes, can come  back, but don't go around.ﬂ Th
ey were very good people, very good wome n, 
really. They loved Irene. She di
dn't cry at night, you know, all th
e time . So they told me to go 
and I went out and I was walking around the bl
ock, it was evening, around the blocks, I wasn't  

afraid that some body can catch me . And I was wa
lking probably for a half an hour or more, 
even. And then I hear some body grabs me . It 
was one of the -- said, ﬁWhat do you think, going 

in such a cold time, all around?  Why don't you come
 back?  I told you take only five, 10 mi nutes, 
that's all. You -- you can get, you know, a pneum
onia or something like that, come in.ﬂ This 
were the wome n. Then when -- also when I ga
ve away the baby, you know, when I said it's  
going to my cousin, Hearanther (ph) says, ﬁWhy 
did you do that?  We  could take care of her if 
you wouldn't, you know.ﬂ And we said, ﬁI'm going to
 work, he is going to work,ﬂ you know, if a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
39 
 
Jew wouldn't be able to take it, ﬁWe would ta
ke care of them.ﬂ They were good wome n. And 
they loved Irene, you know, because she didn't cry,                                                            they 
were afraid in the beginning that, who knows, 
the baby will cry, but -- so this was the st ory 

before I went for the interviews. 

Q: How long did you stay in that room with 
those wome n, do -- do you have any recollection? 
A: About two weeks, probably. Probably two week
s, cause we arranged with Irene quite fast. 

Were afraid for every day, some body would say, ﬁT
hat Jews,ﬂ so they would take away it. So 
Gina arranged it, you know and Dr. Sachat. And 
I was waiting for about two weeks, I would say. 
Q: And -- and while you were waitin
g to hear the news about whethe
r you could go to this -- to 
the sister, did you keep hearing that Irene was 
-- did you get news about 
Irene in the orphanage, 
or not?  

A: Not at that time .  

Q: Okay. 

A: Not at that time, no. No, not at that -- that tim
e. But I knew that she will take care of her, I 
knew that. 

Q: You trusted them? 

A: I trust, absolutely yeah. I trust that she's safe
 there. This is why I di
d it. If I would have any 
doubts, I wouldn't do it. Because if doubts, I can ha
ve outside too, I don't have to give her away. 
But I was sure that she -- bombing, bombardmen
t . The Germa ns are comi ng. So I went there for 
the interviews and of course I 
passed it. And I was like a mother to the children, inst ead of my 
own. I tutored them. She told me -- 
and their sister, Dr. Sachat told me . He was an also engineer, 
architect, the whole building was of architects, 
a co-op of architects. In
telligent, you know, nice 
people. And you know, they said that the house wa s ne
ver in such an order,
 never in their life. 
The oldest son was 14 years old, 
Mirek. Gorgeous, he was like really gorgeous, beautiful. He 
helped me  a lot. He didn't know, the children didn
't  know who I am, that I'm Jewish. Only the -- 
the parents and of course the sarachtinta (ph). 
They come  very often, they used to come , you 
know, for holidays they get together and this 
and that. And she said 
-- her name  was Rouba
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
40 
 
Q: This is the wife? 
A: The wife, yeah, yeah, Halina. Yes, and he 
was Yusef (ph).  And Mirek, Ewa and Julek, the 
three children. They loved me , because I was 
constantly spending time with them, tutoring, 
because the schools, was no, you know, there wa
s -- Mirek was going to school, but it was 
underground. They shouldn't have schools, children
 couldn't go to school. And to wash them and 
sew was sew, I was sewing for them, you know, ever
y -- when they were sick, only they wanted 
me . And she, whenever I call, was going ma rke
ting. She said, ﬁMireczku, you always have to go 
with Miss, it was Miss Pa ni
17
 Lodziu, you know, I was Lodziu Lowakatya (ph). 
Q: What was your -- what was your new na me ? 

A: Lodziu Lowakatya (ph) Sheletska (ph), this is 
what I got in the country, 
that my -- I have the -
- the Kennkarte.
18
 And always go ma rketing with, because
 it's difficult for her, you know, she's 
tiny. And he said, ﬁYes, of course.ﬂ Whenever he used to leave the apartment, he used to bring 

me  coal from the cellar and all ki nds of the heaviest
 things he used to brin
g me. When he used to 
leave the house, he used  come , ﬁPani Lodzi
u, ma y I go? ﬂ  You know, this way. He wa s very 
nice. And the children, the two younger children, 
she was going once a week to another town, 
where she had an uncle, a priest, Lowicz, to Lowi
cz, and bring food. Sour cream, butter, cheeses, 
you know, all kind of things. A lot of it, he'd star
t to prepare for her when she's comi ng and she 
could sell to the neighbors, because we couldn't get it. And she didn't take  much money. Before 

that, she had herself, what she ma de from th
e m, she could pay for her own, to have for the 
fa mily. So she was free to go for a few days, for 
two days, three days, because I took care of the 
fa mily, you know. So it was a double thing. And not 
to ma ke me  feel bad, she was paying me  80 

zlotys a month that I™m working for it, not th
at I™m giving, you know, her this. Through her I had 
a telephone there, Michal could call me . And I had a lot of contacts. Over there was living one 

woma n and also she was a teacher and she wa
s very -- and she probably guessed, we never 
talked about it, but I™m sure she guessed w
ho I am. What I am, you know, who I a m. I found

another one, also a friend of hers and th
at woma n, where I could put my friend, Halinka 
Ellenbogen. She was also a ma id some place. She was always with swollen knees because she 
was on the floor, you know, washing the floors. 
I never did this kind of thing. And she was 
crying and this and that, but she 
looked very well, you know, like r
eally Aryan. She used to come  
up to me  and I gave her a place to live not far 
from me . She was also a teacher. And she had, and 
then I gave her the place with Dr. Zachert in 
Boduen, so she saw Irene every day. And so she had 

the apartment I arranged for her, she had the books 
and French literature, all kinds of things. She 
was so proud of it -- after being a ma id, you know, 
when we came to Florida. And the work she 
had in Boduen, she could see Irene every day. And I got reports from he r about Irene. But one 

day, in the beginning, I wanted to se
e Irene. So I started to wa lk there. It wasn™t too fa r from me , 
it was far enough but not too bad. I could walk then
 have to take the tr
ain which I was avoiding. 
And the children were going from one side of the 
street to the other to pl
ay with the garden. And 
I knew from afar, I could see Irene. And one day I 
decided to go to her, to
 pick up her hand and I 
said, I™ll help you to cross the street. And sh
e gave her hand and she looked at me  and she 
walked with me and the nun came and she starte
d screaming at me , ﬁYou know that you are not 
allowed to touch our children! You can give them 
some  kind of infection!ﬂ which is true. It was 
typhus and syphilis and this kind, so I said, I™m 
sorry. I neve r do it again. So I left Irene and I 
walked away and she said,ﬂ Mommy!ﬂ I got scar
ed. I was afraid that 
the nun heard it but she 
didn™t. I never went again. She recognized me . It
 was after a few months. She was crying the first 
three months, I heard.  
 
02:56:00 

 

Dr. Zachert told me  that. At night, she was crying
. And then, I have a very sharp instinct, I don™t 
know how it happens but it is so. I can some how 
feel out things. I was cooking some thing, I was 
preparing dinner, and I had a dish with peeled po
tatoes to put into the water, put into the pot. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
42 
 
And I was thinking about Irka and I said, ﬁIrka is
 very sick.ﬂ And everything fell down on the 
floor. I didn™t understand why. So then, I called, I 
didn™t call, I called Dr. 
Zachert and I said, ﬁI 
have a feeling that Irka is
 very sick.ﬂ She said, ﬁYes, it™s tr
ue. She still has a mark on her leg, she 
got some  kind of infection.ﬂ And even the priest wanted to come , you know, she was very sick. 
And then, you know, some how she got out of it, you know. 

Q: We  have to change the tape
s, so let™s take a break, okay? 

A: Yes, please.

03:01:04 
 
Q: Rose, I want to go back a little because we fo
rgot a very sweet story about Irene and milk and 
a cow. Can you tell us that story? 
A: Yes. You know, the ghetto when it was establ
ished and they come  down a little bit, they 
settled down, and there were places where they 
had cows. They took them to the field during the 
day, close by, and then, you know, so
me  never went out of the ghett
o, too. And that I couldn™t, I 
was breastfeeding her, but not always I had 
enough and so once she needed milk. And my 
doctors, they believed very much in fresh milk
 so my mother-in-law found out where the cows 
are. They wa sn™t too far from where we lived. 
And we decided to buy milk, fresh milk, as she, 
you know, was selling a lot of things to have 
money for everyday, and so on. We  took, we went 
the first time, I went and bought milk and she 
asked me , ﬁ Which cow do you want?ﬂ To me  they 
looked all the same , but I said, ﬁThis cow.ﬂ So sh
e gave me  milk from this cow and from then 
on, I was always buying from the same  cow the milk because I was afraid ma ybe another cow 

could get sick or something will happen to her an
d then it will be a refl ection on Irene. So we 
had the milk all the time, whenever I bought, from the same cow. 

Q: Wa s Irene hungry? 

A: Irene was never hungry. Maybe was in the orph
anage, I don™t think the children were hungry 
in the or phanage because they got some  
food, whether it was good food or bad food, I don™t 

know. But I am sure that she was never hungry. She 
needed a lot, let™s s
ee, other things like a 
fruit, a chocolate, which I always sent in, and 
Dr. Zachert used to give her. Even my husband, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
44 
 
Michal, he went a few times to the orphanage 
and brought the chocolate and good things to Dr. 
Zachert so she can give it to her. And she was 
giving to her, I gave it 
to her and she was giving 
very quietly to Irene, I know, so
me thing special. But when he we
nt there, she was screaming at 
him, she said to never show up again. Because it was very da ngerous for the child.  
 

03:03:59 

 

Nobody should know, only the director of the orphana
ge knew, the woman, that she is a Jewish 
child, and I can -- only the mother
 -- can pick her up. This was her restriction, Dr. Zachert™s, 
when Irene came to the orphanage. She said only I 
can pick her up and not to give the child to 
anybody because people adopt, you know how it is,she looked as a very Aryan child. She was 

blonde. You™ll see the photogr
aphs of her when she™
s a little, a li
ttle child. So this is, you know, 
but I don™t think Irene was hungry. 
Q: So even in the ghetto she wasn™t hungry? 
A: I don™t think so, no. And that– Look, she was 
the only child in our family, you know. We  

could be hungry, I was not ever, not all the 
time, you know, I had enough, believe me. But Irene, 
no, Irene had even fresh milk from t he same  co
w. No, she wasn™t hungry. And later on, she got -- 
I would have a very difficult time, but Irene us
ually had everything when it come s to food. Eve n, 
even her clothes, later on, I was sewing and Halinka was sewing for her, so we had, she was, I 

don™t think Irene suffered. 

Q: When you described the de
portation of your mother, and your
 mother-in-law and father-in-
law, there™s a piece of the story th
at I think that, that you didn™t tell us about Gina seeing them at 
the gate? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
45 
 
A: Yeah, Gina wasn™t there when the raid was in
 the building, but she was in the hospital. But 
she saw them later on in the Umschlagplatz, a
nd Maria was carrying her father™s -- I mean, 
Irene™s great-grandfather, a golde
n watch which the me n alwa ys carri
ed in their vests, with the 
chains, the golden chains. And she took this wa
tch and she gave it to 
Genia and said, ﬁThis 
watch, this golden watch, is for Irene. Whenever sh
e would be in need to have it, to buy her out 
of whatever happens, but this is for this child.ﬂ 
And she gave it to Irene and then, she gave it to 
Gina and Gina gave it to me . And later on, I gave
 it to Dr. Zachert for her when she was in the 
orphanage. With the address of the 
Aunt here in the States, inside 
the watch I put in a little card 
with the address of Irene™s grandmother™s sister
, here in the St ates. Bu
t she was killed by the 
Ukrainians in the Polish uprising. 

Q: Dr. Zachert? 

 

03:07:16 
 
A: With her husband, yeah. 

Q: Yeah, hold on for a second. Rose, can you, can 
you tell us how Dr. Zachert and her husband 
were killed? 

A: In the Polish uprising, it was 1944. The Ukrainia
ns were there, the Latv
ians were there, the 
Lithuanians on the side of Ger many and they we
re behaving terrible. Th
ey were drinking and 
killing and this was the case with Dr. Zachert 
because some body told us what happened at that 
time. They took all the people down, they lived in 
a very fine neighborhood, this is where I was, 
not far from them. And t hey took them down on 
onto the court and just killed them and robbed 
them. And a t  that time, also, you know, when the 
watch was then with them. But this was what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
46 
 
they were doing. Before I want to still tell you 
about going back, my life, this Rouba, that Halina 
Ellenbogen used to come  up to me , did I tell you that? 
Q: Wa s she the one who was living in the, yes, you told me . 

A: Yes, I told you about that. That she was, you 
know, I gave her the job and then, at that time , 
also during that time , we  used to go, you know, meeting, then I me t Maria  and Blanca, Maria 

Rosenbloom (ph) and Blanca Rosenberg. 

Q: And how did you me et them? 

A: It was by pure accident. Halina Ellenbogen was 
before Madden Sanitarium (ph) a sanitarium 
for children, for sick children under the auspic
es of Bund. Ma dden (ph) wa s one of the great 
leaders from the Bund Œ really a theoretician of
 the Bund -- so there was 
a sanitarium named in 
his name  and during the war. She was there. Pe
relka is really her name , Ellenbogen. There was 
also Boleck Ellenbogen and Anya (ph) Elle
nbogen, so it was the family. And after the 
liquidation of the Madden Sanitarium, in fact, Mi
chal came there and told them one night that 
they can go out but they didn™t h
ear; they were on another side of the -- and this was from 
Warsaw quite a few miles, about 10 or 15 miles. 

 

03:10:05 

 

 They had to go by train, and they didn™t hear hi
m, but he went at night
. Halina said that she 
heard him, but they couldn™t come to that point b
ecause they were afraid. So they then came  to 
Warsaw, there was one woma n also, a teacher, 
in Madden Sanitarium, which was -- Irene was 
also young and she took care of her and she came to
 look for work. And at that time Blanca and 
Maria were working at the Germans; she pr
obably told you. And she came to ask for work. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
47 
 
There were Volksdeutscher
19
 Ger mans, or German, ﬁreal Germans.ﬂ And so she, Blanca, was the 
head ma id over the housekeeper, for the Germans,
 and she looked at her, and she said, ﬁMy 
name  is Geneska (ph),ﬂ which is a Polish name . So Blanca answered her, ﬁ We have a lot of 
Geneska™s (ph) like that, you know.ﬂ And through 
her, Halina came to Blanca and Maria and, as 

we were me eting cons tantly, you know, Sundays we
 had all off. So we™re meeting in one place, 
either at Anya (ph) Ellenbogen™s, where she 
was working, her mi stress was going out, so we 
brought in Bl anca and Maria also 
there. And sometimes we were 
going there because they could 
listen to the radio, to the, you 
know, Germans could have radio, so
 we could listen to what™s 
going on. So this is how I got, you know -- we were
, I want to tell you, dur
ing that time we were 
meeting, all these friends, and we™re meeting Ma
rysia Sevitzka, you know, and just Navel (ph) 
Halska (ph), who gave us a lot of help, particular
ly to Michal and Gina 
and when Gina was sick, 
they were taking care of her. 
But this was during the Aryan si
de, until the Polish uprising in 
1944. And during, you know, the Polish uprising -- 
Q: Could we, could we go back, because in some
 ways we are moving fa
ster. There™s a period 
between October-November, when Irene goes into
 the orphanage and you™re working at that 
house. Between that time and then the uprisi
ng in the Wa rsaw ghetto, the Jewish, Jewish 
uprising, and how much you™re
 seeing, Michal and -- 
A: And the Jewish were upris
ing, the Wa rsaw ghetto uprising
, you talking?  How much I was 
seeing? 
Q: Seeing him, what did you know about
 what he was doing at that point? 
 

03:12:53 

 
                     
19
 Ethnic German (Ger ma n). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
48 
 
A: Okay, yes. At that point, I knew already wh
at he was doing. We  were
 meeting constantly. We  
were meeting and let™s say, some ti mes I was stay
ing there overnight, t
oo, that worker who me t 
him in the street and said, ﬁ What are you doing he
re? ﬂ  He gave him a sh
elter then. It was a 
baseme nt, some thing like that Œ or maybe a low 
ground floor apartment. So he slept there, you 
know. This was his place at that time. And we 
were meeting either there or other places, 
some ti me s in a coffee shop which he knew was safe to go into a certain room, or whatever. And 
he was writing a lot, what™s going on, and 
he was meeting with the leaders fr om the 
underground. And there was a special
 place also fr om the Bundists, on Sharavial (ph) Street and 
he was leaving there, the happenings, you 
know, the events, which he was writing down 
everyday. And I reme mb er sitting once with some  
coffee and he was writing, and I said, ﬁAren™t 
you afraid? ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, this is, you know, we
 have to leave some thing. What™s happening 
now.ﬂ He, he wrote everyday. He was very, ve
ry, you know, historically mi nded, and to let 

people know what™s happening. So we were me e
ting, I would say once a week for sure, when 
Mrs. Rouba saw that I am very depressed or
 some thing, she says, ﬁWhy don™t you go and meet 
your husband,ﬂ because whenever I come  back
 from these meetings, you know, I was elated. I 
was -- started to believe this wi
ll be the end of it. He always
 could put me  in such a mood, you 
know, really. ﬁBe patient, you™ll see, we will come
 through, we  will take Irene,ﬂ you know, these 
kind of things. And I was always looking forw
ard for the weekend you know, to see him. We 
used to meet constantly. And he used to tell me what™s going on, what he is doing, at that time . 

Q: So did you know that he was Œ 

A: I know. 

 Q: --creating the explosion, that he was teaching people? 

A: I knew, I knew that, yeah. I knew that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
49 
 
Q: We re you torn about what he was doing? 
A: Yes. I had a big conflict because this was ve
ry dangerous, what he is doing. He was exposed, 
he was going in and out because he looked well,
 but you know, there are always those, they™ll 
called shma ltsovnik,
20
 you know. They take money, you know. And they can always spot you -- 
and they even took Stefan, that I™m talking abou
t, was sleeping. He later 
on started to get money 
from other people and then, you know, telling all kinds
 of stories and he just cut off with him. 
Q: The man he was living with for a time? 

 

03:16:03 

 

A: He wouldn™t harm Michal, but other people th
at were comi ng, if Vladka was comi ng in there 
too, you know, was sometimes... Because, you know, the connections with, with all that. So, I 

had a big conflict with that. What is more impor
tant?  I and the child or 
this?  I had a tremendous 
conflict. But to him it was impor
tant. He couldn™t do otherwise. 

Q: Did you talk about the conflic
t together or couldn™t -- did 
you not feel able to do that? 
A: No. I couldn™t do it to him. 
And the last time he called me , we had the telephone, Mrs. Rouba 
had the telephone, he called me . This was before the 17
th
 -- it was about the 16
th
 -- of April, it 
was Irene™s birthday and his, and 
he called me  and he said that 
he™s going back into the ghetto 
because they know that they will be comi ng, 
the Germans wi ll come  and surround the ghetto and 
the fight will start. And I said at that time , 
ﬁMaybe you won™t go.ﬂ He said, ﬁI must go.ﬂ I didn™t 
say anything anymore. This was it. And he wi
shed me , you know, Irene, and all that. It was his 
birthday, his 30
th
 birthday. And Irene was how much?  
Two years old. I had a tremendous 
conflict. For a long, long time, ma ybe up to now
, who knows. But what™s more important. You 
                     
20
 A person who, for money or favor
, betrayed Jews in hiding. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
50 
 
cannot judge. We  were very important to him, 
I  know that. He left Irene. He felt when she was 
born, that  there™s no ot her child who is more educated, more intelligent and prettier than she is, 
so?  He was very proud, very proud of her. So
 this was, you know, we were meeting, and 

constantly. In different pl aces, we were meeting. And later on, when -- after the Wa rsaw ghetto 

uprising -- we started to meet w
ith other people, and as I say, 
it was Blanca and Maria and Anya 
(ph) Ellenbogen, and Boleck E
llenbogen and Halina Ellenbogen. 
 

03:19:01 

 

 Halina is also not her name , but, Pe arl is he
r name . And Ha lina was nearby me , over there, she 
got the job and Anya (ph) was still worki
ng as a ma id, and Bolek was working in the 
construction business. So, we, we used to meet. 
Some times we went to Marysia Sawicka™s home  
and Navel (ph) Halska (ph). And there was a time
 when Michal was grabbed in the street and 
going to Treblinka. He was on th
e train, and he jumped. He jumped from the train and the 
Germans shoot and it was, it was -- 
he got it in his leg, the bullet,
 and he was, he couldn™t walk, 
but he hid so meplace in the field where he jump
ed from and the first place he waited until the 
morning. This was closer to th
e evening, mi ddle of the morning, some thing. In the morning, he 
went to Marysia Sawicka and Nave
l (ph) Halska (ph), they lived 
together. And they took him in, 
of course. Under, underneath, Gestapo lived. They
 had a big apartment, Gestapo. And there was 
no toilets there, you know, so they had to carry out everything. But they did it. They were 

ma rvelous, they were really ma rvelous. They he
lped a lot, they give 
such a shelter to many 
people, particularly to Gina when Gina got si
ck. Gina got sick and she died, you know, before 
the Polish uprising. She died in 1942. She felt sh
e had ulcers and she c
ouldn™t function. She was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
51 
 
very sick, and I wasn™t the stronge
st either and a small child, so sh
e felt that she ha
d to take care 
of us. The only way being, and that is knowi
ng what™s the matter, she couldn™t go for an 
operation. But this was a Polish, you know, hospital. 
And how much care she–
Michal didn™t tell 
me .  
 

03:22:01 

 

 She talked to me  about going for an operati
on, I said, ﬁNever.ﬂ I said, ﬁOver my dead body 

you™re going to the hospital because I am afraid
 they mi ght not give you good care.ﬂ And Michal 
did not tell me  that she went to the hospital, but 
I found out that she died 
in the hospital after the 
operation. And this was in December, 1942. 
So another link of the family went. 
Q: Can, can you tell me  a little bit more of wh
at she was doing?  She seemed to have been 
helping an awful lot of pe
ople in the Umschlagplatz? 
A: And she was working in the hospital, too, in
 that stupid hospital, 
you know, created, it wasn™t 
a real hospital. It was just ma de a hospital. Sh
e was working there as a nurse. This is why I had 
the privileges of being in the nursing room, 
in the nurses™ room, you know, and having these 
doctors operating on me . 

Q: How, how did she have the, who granted her th
e privilege of being at 
the Umschlagplatz, and 
how did she start? 

A: On her own. 

Q: On her own? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
52 
 
 A: This is on her own. Of course, she put on 
her uniform, you know, had 
a special uniform with 
such, on her own, with her hat. 
You will see her hat, yeah. This
 is, you know, a sort of nurse. 
This was on her own. 
Q: And the Germans di dn™t stop her? 

A: At that time , they let in, you know, still this was 
the beginning of this, they let in at that time . 
So, she took them out, for this case, this case,
 you know. They always could find some kind of 
excuse for the official people. She was like an official person. Gina was a ma rvelous person 

anyway. She loved this baby like, she was a joy 
for the whole fa mily, in those circumstances. 
Q: You know, we™ve talked privately about luckand about how everything was so arbitrary. One 

didn™t know from one moment to th
e next if one would be living. 
A: That™s right. This was, for example, you know,
 as I was going to meet Michal, let™s say, and 

we always waited until the last mo ment before th
e police time–to get home . He was in one side 
of the city, I was in the other si
de, we didn™t want to take the tr
am, and then I see the streets is 
empty.  

 

03:25:03 

 

I was walking, you know, in the street and then
 from afar I see an SS ma n walking, you know, 
with his arm and I don™t know whether to pass or 
to cross the other si de. If I cross, it will be 
suspicious. I probably should go straight. And 
I went ma rching through him straight. And I 
passed. Behind me , about 20 yards behind me
, was, I heard, you know, some body walking. 
There™s another woma n and he stopped her. Wh
y not me , but her, who is probably Polish?  
Because who would risk, you know, this kind of 
thing?  He stopped her. I don™t know what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
53 
 
happened, but he stopped her. If he, if he woul
d stop me , it would be the end of me  because all 
my knowing the, the, the, the prayers, you know, 
and all that. I wouldn™t 
pa ss. Because they can 
always hook up to some thing, which I 
couldn™t answer or be not true. 

Q: Did you look Jewish? 

A: I looked like nothing, I told
 you, I looked like nothing. Not th
is way, not this way, I looked 
like some body that doesn™t ma tter, you know, doesn™t 
pay attention to me . I was wearing a hat, I 
was wearing a black coat. 
To look like nothing, you know. 

Q: Do you also try to look like nothing? 

A: Of course. Of course, yeah. Not to pay att -- no
t to call at tention to my self. I was there dressed 
norma lly, and Sundays, you know, it™s the ma in thing. 
When I was going out to meet this one or 

this one, this was that. 

Q: Could you tell us about this dream that you had? 

A: Yes. Wh en Michal was still alive, we we
re getting the bulletin, it™s called ﬁInforma tive 
Bulletinﬂ from London, we use to get, and 
this was underground. And I was picking it up 
some place, on certain street, for the whole buildi
ng. It was a co-op building for the engineers, 
architects, engineers, and they 
were all, you know, patriots, Polis
h patriots. Only the concierge™ 
was a little shaky for me . And he didn™t know, if
 he would know, I wouldn™t be, you know, there. 
If he would guess even, I wouldn™t be, he woul
d finish with me , to get some  money fr om 
Gestapo. 

 

03:28:02 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
54 
 
 And Michal was still alive and I was, I had a dr
eam. I woke up and I was all wet. I dreamt that I 
see in that bulletin, I see a news item about 
ﬁMichal Klepfisz, engineer, was caught while 
ma king ar msﬂ, you know, and was, and he was killed, some thing like that. And I reme mber it 
was page three; one, two, you know Œ the first page
, the number three -- and I couldn™t believe it. 
And truly enough, it was in 19 Œ late ™43, 
I get the bulletin, Biuletyn Informacyjny,
21
 Michal was 
already dead. It was the end of
 the year, I don™t reme mber which month, it was the same news 
item!  And he was awarded. It was the me dal of
 Virtuti Militari,the 
only me dal given, you know, 
to a Jew at the time of the Nazi occupation. Ho
w would this happen, I don™t know, but this is a 

fact. Being still on the Ar yan side, I 
had to have my Kennkarte, you know? 
Q: Let me, let me, can I stop you for a mi nute?  
How did you find out that he was killed?  When 
did you find out? 

A: I found out two weeks later, about 10 days la
ter. Vladka came to tell me. It was a little 
unfortunate the way she did it, 
but she wanted the best, proba
bly, but she told me. We  met 
Sunday, on my, you know, free day. She called me  a
nd was, because I didn™t hear from hi m at 
all, and the fighting was going on and she got a 
contact from the ghetto. Marek Edelma n (ph) 
was in his group, with Michal, and the whol
e group was there. And she found out, you know, 
they let her know. But she didn™t 
tell me for a while, and she al
so, it was probably difficult for 
her to tell me. And we met in the street
, in a park, and she told me  about that. 
 

03:31:04 

 

Q: So she knew longer than, for a longer time  be fore she told you? 

A: A few da ys longer. I don™t know how 
ma ny days, you know, but it was later on. 
                     
21
 Information Bulletin (Polish). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
55 
 
Q: What did you mean it was 
unfortunate how she told you? 
A: She started to talk about other things, you 
know, tried to ma ke me  
laugh, this–you know, but 
forget about it. This is a -- but
 I couldn™t comfort myself for a long time. This was the end, yeah. 
Q: Did the family help, that you were stay
ing with?  I mean, you were -- did you tell them?  
A: Yes. Because they knew I am beside myself. They were very warm, ve ry sympathetic, you 
know. The children didn™t know. So the children 
never knew who I was. And, so this was that. 
Q: And then you had to start again in a way? 

A: On my own, without any advice. To ma ke my  
own decisions and how to deal with the stress. 
And then came  the offer, after a while, for th
e Hotel Polski. The director of that, you know, 
Guzik. He was very well known, he was in the Jude
nrat; he was personagrata 
(ph). He said that I 
can go to France with Irene. The 
Jews paid thousands and thousa
nds of dollars to get out and 
they could–. They were all in that Hotel Polski
, it was hotel. Whoever paid was in this hotel, the 
Jews. And I went there twice, I reme mber, to visi
t some  people, to find out what it is and how it 
is; who are going, who paid in and going. And ther
e was a woma n, Estusia Lipszyc, her husband 
was also very fa mous Bundist 
and activist and she had a son a
nd a daughter older overseas. And 
she was going. She paid in because she sold, sh
e was a dentist, she sold everythi ng, you know, 
her cabinet, you know, this, everything. And she ha
d the money and she paid in and she was 
going. So I came  there and she saw me, she says
, ﬁLook, I have two childre
n, I am not afraid; I 
am going, that I want to be together.ﬂ And I told
 her that I had the offer from Guzik, she says, 
ﬁ Why don™t you take your child and go?!ﬂ I said, 
ﬁI™m scared, I don™t know. I cannot ma ke this 
kind of decision. Now she is in the orphanage, sh
e is safe. I don™t know what™s going to happen. 
She is safe now. And the ma in thing is her sa
fety.ﬂ I went once; I 
looked around at the people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
56 
 
who are going there, they were most ly Jews, so it
 was dangerous, but I took the risk, I wanted to 
know.  
 

03:35:04 

 

Then I went the second time , and I reme mber that
 I met I think Meed, his 
brother, I think, went 
there also. And I think so. I think it wa s his brot
her. And I spoke again and I still, I couldn™t 
ma ke the decision because Irene  was safe. I fe
lt. Whether it was true 
or not, I don™t know, but 
this is how I felt at that time . And I came back 
and I had to give an answer because  the Guzik 
had to know the amount of people to get out from 
Wa rsaw to France. Vittel, this was the town, 
Vittel, the famous town,Vittel. And I spoke to Mrs. Rouba 
and him and they said to me, ﬁWe 
don™t trust the Germans. If you want to go, go, but
 we don™t trust them.ﬂ And this was some how 

my point, decision. They helped me  to decide 
not to go and I did a good thing because all the 
people went to Auschwitz from Hotel Polski. 
So, how do you know?  This is luck. You ma ke a 
decision, you don™t know right or wr ong. And I di
dn™t have anybody close to find out, to ask 
what should I do?  But this was my 
de cision. They helped me  to do it. And this is how it was. So, 
then came the -- we met with friends of mi ne, as
 I told you, with whom. And it was nice at that 
time to see some body friendly. And they were good company, you know, me aning (ph). They in 

they were -- when the Germans, you know, they 
were working for the Germans, they had a 
picture of a Polish Œ Zeromski, you know, author, 
very famo us, you can imagine, whe n we came 
in there. Then came the Polish uprising. This 
is 1944 and they came to our building, too. And 
they took us out, the Rouba fa mily, the whole Rouba fa mily. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
57 
 
03:58:00 
 

 Mireck, the oldest one, went 
to fight. With the, you know, w
ith the uprising. He was in the 
uprising. And one of the days, Halina told me , Ha
lina Ellenbogen, when they were in the bunkers 
hiding, they were going from places to places. W
ho came there?  Mireck. As Halina and I use to 
come up to meet, to visit me there, Mireck 
came in and said, ﬁ What 
are you doing here? ﬂ  She 
said, ﬁThe same  thing as everybody else.ﬂ He went
 out and an hour later 
he brought her sugar, a 
whole box of sugar. She couldn™t get over it. Th
en he was killed in the uprising. Mirek was 
killed, the oldest son. And the mother said, ﬁG
od gave and God took.ﬂ She was a very religious, 
you know, Catholic. Then they came to us to take 
us and she, with her 
husband, the two children 
and I went to a camp, to a big, big field where 
they were selling all kind of vegetables. They 
were comi ng from countries and the villages to
 sell vege tabl es, a tremendous place. And they 
took us there, the Ukrainians. They were wild. They wanted to kills us , you know, in that 
apartment, so she gave them a bottle of vodka a
nd they started to drink and we went down. And 
this we, you know, we joined the other people 
and we were taken, walking, you know, to that 
zazielenic,
22
 it was called. Zazielenic is
 green, the vegetables we re
 called zaziel
enic, you know. 
And it was an open place with tens of thousands 
of people were there guarded. We  were taken to 
Pruszków. It was a transient camp. There we
re factories, not 
working factories. 
Q: Who brought you?  The Germans who brought you? 
A: Ukrainians.

there. And we were there sleepi
ng there, you know, just on the gr
ass, were the two children. And 
then they were taken to Pr uszków, to the factorie
s there. So we  had a roof under, but nothing else 
there. And they said that people with 
children, who have children, can go out.  
 
03:41:00 

 

Because they were taki ng people for work to Ge
rmany, so with people with children can go out. 
So we have two children over there. And there™s 
he and she. But I don™t have a child. So I was 

there, I saw there a nun with a fe
w children and I ask her whether she can give me  a child and an 
address where I can deliver the child later. A
nd this way I will go out. She gave me  -- she was 
grateful that she can get rid of one
 child at least. She gave me  th
is child and we all went out and 
we went to Ro-bus (ph), an old, the next little
 town from Pruszków . 
We  walked. And we went 
there and I was with this strang
e little girl. She was four or 
five years old. And what do we do 
now?  There is no money, there 
is nothing. And I don™t know what is going to happen to Irene 
because everything was being evacuated. I knew 
that I have to go back and find out what™s 
happened to Irene, to Pruszków, at least. And I 
got an address from another convent, me anwhile, 
I was there a few days. I took the little girl. I brou
ght her to that convent 
and I went back. I slept 
in the convent for a whole night,
 I didn™t know who I am. I said that the parents, so and so and 
so, you know. And I we nt back and then I told th
e Roubas™, ﬁI am going to Pruszków. I have to 
find out what™s happened with Irene.ﬂ She sa
ys, ﬁWhere are you going, where are you going to 
stay? ﬂ  She had a friend in Pruszków, on Olowkowa,
 the street in the [Indecipherable] 11, and I 
got the address from her .  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
59 
 
03:43:19 
 

And one mo rning, she says, ﬁYou have no mone y, you have nothing.ﬂ I says, ﬁWhat can I do, but 

I have to go.ﬂ So when they were all sleeping still,
 I left her a note that I am going to this and this 
address, that she knows where I am because sh
e was worried about me . And I have to know 
what™s, what™s happening to her. I wa s hungry, bu
t I was walking through fields with the wheat 
as I was taking out the kernels and I was eating this
, and I came to that person, to that family, and 
I told her that I know Mrs. Rouba. She didn™t kn
ow anything, that I am J e wish, you know, and I 
came that I was, I know them. I didn™t say that 
I was working there, but I know them. And I me t 
them. And t hat I was in the Polish uprising and 
my husband is in Germany, he is working. And 
my daughter, my child, is in orphanage because we
 had to do, we had to do some thing to ma ke a 
living and she should be safe. Is in the orphanage
 in, the Polish orphanage, a Catholic orphanage, 
you know. So everything is kosher. And I starte
d to run around to find 
out, the convent. I found 
out the convent and I told them the story, I was 
fighting in the Polish uprising, my hus band is in 
Germany and all the same  story. And my child is
 in the orphanage. Is Boduena comi ng here?  Did 
you hear anything about Boduen?  They said, 
ﬁYes, we know that they are going to be 
evacuated.ﬂ So, ﬁGood. When? ﬂ  ﬁWe don™t know,
 but leave me  your address and I let you 

know.ﬂ They were very nice and very kind. So I le
ft them the address, where I was, but I was 

gone everyday. I did not rely on 
that. To that Pruszków, to that camp, the big gates where, 
because it wa s a factory before that, and the Ge
rmans were sending their armi es there, you know, 

arms, and they were pushing me  all the time. I wa
s going closer, ma ybe can take a look inside or 
whatever. I was running. One day, I came over ther
e, I was almost the whole day because I was 
afraid they will come  and I wouldn™t know, were 
they going or whatever. One day, I come  in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381

December, they said some body was standing ther
e, ﬁBoduena  orphanage come , ca me  already.ﬂ 
So I heard this, I said, ﬁThis is 
it.ﬂ I was waiting, I was already fu
rther a little bit fr om the gate. I 
was afraid that they would catch me  there. 
So I going further down and I see after ma ybe an 
hour, one cart came out with children. You know,what™s cart, the Polish peasants have a cart; 
there™ s a board in the center and there is two 
like other boards, but a 
little length. And the 
children were from both sides sitting, the sm
all children, you know. A
nd they™re heads were 
going like that onto the board. Th
ere was one cart that came  out with a horse, you know, this 
was, was drawn by a horse.  

 
03:47:00 
 

And Irene wasn™t there. Ca me  another one. Wa sn™t
 there. The third one, I found her. There is one 
nun there with the children, in the cart. I let 
them go because I was afraid, near, near the 
Germans. I let them go and quite a while I wa
s running after them on the other side so nobody 
would, you know, be suspicious. And I -- then I pr
otest up the, the cart.And I said to the nun, 
ﬁHere is my little child, I want to take her.ﬂ 
She said, ﬁTake her.ﬂ I said, ﬁChodz do mamusi.ﬂ 
ﬁCome to Mommy.ﬂ She  stretched out her hands
, you know, and I took her. And I run. This 
child, a running nose with the diarrhea. I felt her 
head, I saw that she has fe ver. I took her home. 
I took her temperature, it was 
in Celsius, you know, 40 degrees
, which is 104º Fahrenheit. I 
didn™t know what to do. I have not a penny to
 my soul. I don™t know
 anybody. What do I do?  
Well, I asked about a doctor. The people I liv
ed with, you know, I was 
already there about a 
week, probably. I asked a doctor ab
out a doctor and they gave me  
a name  of a doctor, a Polish 
doctor. I went there. ﬁI was in the uprisi
ng, my husband is in Germany, my child was in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
61 
 
orphanage. I just brought her back, she is sick and sh
e has a lot of fever.ﬂ So he said bring her. I 
said, ﬁI have no money.ﬂ He sai
d, ﬁBring her.ﬂ And when I left to look for the doctor, Irka (ph), 
Irene said to me, ﬁMommy, will you still come b
ack? ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, I™ll be back.ﬂ I took the 
child. He said, ﬁShe has deep bronchitis. She ha s in
fection of all her intestines. You have to give 
her me dication and ground apples and take ground 
meat, make balls, boil 
it without anything and 
give it to her. That™s all.ﬂ  
 

03:50:04 

 

I brought her back and there were 
a lot of, you know, fruit 
cartons that sell, so I use to see that 
apples were on the ground, so one evening I went
 out and I picked up the apples. I ground them, 
gave them. I borrowed money from my, from wh
ere I lived, I said, ﬁI™ll sew some thing for you, 
I™ll be sewing and I will return
 it. I will return the money to 
you.ﬂ And she gave me  and I bought 
the meat and then, me dication, what do 
I do now?  So there wa s like Kupat-Cholim
23
 in Israel . 
Kasa-chorych
24
 it was called, and I went there. ﬁI wa
s in the Polish uprising, my husband is in 
Germany and my child is very sick, I have no 
mo ney. Can I get the me dication?ﬂ He said, ﬁOf 
course you will get it.ﬂ They gave
 me  the without the money. The doctor didn™t take  money; they 
didn™t take money, I bought it, you know?  She came
 out. She came out from that and she was, 
she was happy with me . There was a teenager, Halin
a, and I was there. There came  a time  when 
they needed the papers, the Kennkarte, you know
. And she got used to it, you know, Irene, she 

settled down some how. Then I needed a Kennkart
e, the document, without this, you know, I am 
nothing. And one winter day, I decided to go for it 
because I had the birth certificate of the, you

know, sister of our ma id once, what she gave me  
from the, when I went to the village that, on 
this basis I could get a Ke nnkarte, 
but the risk to go to the offici
al bureau to get a Kennkarte is 
like to go, you know, on to the guillotine. And this 
highway, I am in Pruszków and this is in 

another town. I cannot go by train, I have to walk
 on the highway. I gave her instructions, I said, 
ﬁIn case ma ybe something happens to me, this and this and this.ﬂ ﬁWhat will you do?ﬂ I said, ﬁI 

don™t know.ﬂ ﬁNothing will happe
n to you, go.ﬂ And I went.  
 

03:53:00 

 

I had no instructions to give, to leave her 
with anybody, you know?  And I 
go with this highway. 
It was quite a few miles. And I™m the  only one ther
e, it™s cold, it™s terribl
y cold, I didn™t have 
any, some thing too, too warm to we ar anyway. 
And against me walks a woman and she passes 
me  by with, we always started, not to look each ot
her in the face, whoever 
I see, better not. And I 
see a familiar face but I wasn™t sure, I was afra
id. And I go. A few steps further, you know, five 
or six steps, I turn around, the woma n stands and 
turns around too. I decided to me et her. And we 
go to each ot her and who is it? It was Halina Szef
ner, who was the professor of my husband™s in 
a gimnazjum who teach him French, and I 
knew her. I knew her husband too. He was a 
journalist. And you can imagine. I had so ma
ny pimples on my face because, you know, I didn™t 
eat ri ght and all that. The fi rst th
ing what she did with me , there was a kiosk selling little things, 
she bought me  yeast, to eat it. I get vitami ns
, you know, for the pimples. She gave me  the 

contacts. She looked like, I say again, like 
a thousand, like a ton you know, going, beautiful 
woma n. I have a photograph of her. She was so 
marvelous, really, gray hair, white hair, she 
looked like a queen. She gave 
me  the contacts of Mirek. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381  
63 
 
Q: Mirek Edelma n? 
A: Yeah. She came me  t he contacts, Mirek a
nd Anielewicz, you know, the whole group. Not 
Anielewicz, but Antek, Antek and Sylvia. She gave
 me  the contacts over there. And she used to 
come , you know, and visit me  and when she looked 
at Irene, she told me  later, ﬁThis child is 
very sick,ﬂ she told me . I mean, Irene was quite we ll already. Can you ima gine how she looked?  

Anyway, one day, so I had to contact with her al
ready, and she let them 
know that I am some 
place, you know?  She let them know because she wa
s in contact with them. And one day, I took 
Irene.  

 

03:55:58 

 

First of all, I had to take her to Boduena. They
 were taking all the child
ren to big factories of 
silk, a little for sewing silk, you know
, the little things, a
nd the factories. All 
the children are, if 
Irene would go there she wouldn™t co
me  out alive, being so sick at that time. I decided to go to 
tell the di rect or that I took Ire
ne because it was her re
sponsibility and I felt at that time, also 
stupid of me , but it was right to do that, because
 she would be worried, what happened to Irene , 
who took her?  Because she was told
 not to, not to give her to 
anybody. So, I went there to her, 
this was the fi rst trip I did by 
train. And I came back. And after I me t Halina Szefner, I decided 

to go to see Mirek Edelma n with the whole group. And, because they would give me  help, 

money they would give me , they had money. And 
I went there, I went to the train and on the 
way, a mother of my friend who looked like a hu
ndred Jews, I ma de like that [shaking head 
ﬁnoﬂ]. I approached her. So we got off and we 
we nt to Mirek and Ala, 
his wife, and there was 
Sylvia and Antek together. Well, you can imagine th
at he saw us. Mirek was with, with the last 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0381

mi nute, you know, with Michal. By the way, Mirek 
buried Michal in the same  court where he 
was killed. Did I tell yo
u how he was killed?

y mor ning whe n she we nt to t he hosp

ﬁRozka, I am going to meet
 my father and mother,ﬂ
 because she knew that
 it will be drilling about 
her pa st, her childhood, a nd thi s

after she came back. It  was a pure 
accident, fr om so
mebody else, not  
myself. I prepared myself to tell 
her on the wee ke nd I a m home, to 
be wit h  her. Doe sn™ t wor k like  
that. This wa s Elza, you know? 
Because t hey were goo

was the first time I saw him -- 
Marek. You know, still during the wa

 at that time 
what happened. 
Wh at happened is that the whole

trying to get through
 to another building. 
The y di dn™t know t hat there wa s a Ge r ma n wi th a

A: A machi ne gun, yeah. In a corner or wher e ev

they realized and the y  
coul dn™t  ge t through to the

Marek Edel ma n, t he sa me group, was the one who ju

 which now, later on,

buil dings we re burne d a n d s o on. But  he gave hi m 
the funeral, you 
know. He  just buried him over  
there in t he c ourt , yea h. And thi s is what he tol d me
 at that ti me, when I went
 to visit him.  But since 
I visited Mirek there, I got the co

I wa s in the bedr oom wit h Irene in one bed, a not he

Q: So how l ong wer e

Q: I wa nte d to as k you a que stion 
a bout Ire ne duri ng t his peri od. She 
see m ed fr om your  desc ripti on, 
the little that you say 
about her, rather than your

some ways she wa s a c al m chil d.
 That she was ver y go

A: No. 

Q: -- any problems  in a

 As  if she understood.

04: 30: 00 

 

She was very sporty,

and went on a hill and said, 
ﬁYou j ust hold t he br akes and go

She did it . Sai d to me , he said, ﬁ You go

A: We we re so b usy wit h  every

 bring a -- let™s 
say Chana and I. 
Then I got an apartment -- no -- I lived with Bo
leck, the Ellenbogens. My
 one  re move d cousi n met  
me , he was i n the Poli sh ar my. An
d he was alwa ys in the uniform.  
He wa sn™t in the army anymore, 
but he was very tall , ha nds ome , a nd he went t o 
all these offi cers and he 
said, ﬁ Zychl inski , I  a m  
Zyc hli nski , Ge neral Zyc hlins ki ,ﬂ or somet hing li ke

ﬁThi s was i n  my na me be caus e  nob

took in the Ellenbogens. 
The  apart me nt was in my  na me , a nd he 
was worki ng for t he J o urnal  at t hat

there. It wa s, you

 We used to do some s ewi ng a nd

A: Yes , onc e  Irene wa s playi ng

Thi s boy t ol d -- call ed me ‚zydowka,™ ﬂ
28
 -- you know -- Jewess. ﬁWha
t does it me an, ‚zydowka™?ﬂ 
She couldn™ t underst and that. But t his is a n e x
ample, a child come s u
p. And then there wer e 
constantly killings, they 
were killing, murders. And we decided 
to go away at th
at time. It was  
antise mitism, it was. ﬁWhy didn™t they
 finish up everybody?
ﬂ So it wasn™t easy, 
but to Lódz came a  
lot of people. The same thing to 
Wa rs aw, t he  sur vi vors  looking for  th
e fa mi lies; they stayed here or 
there . In all kind, but the  at mos pher e  was ver y 
bad. Th en we  decided, th
e, the Jacob Patt came to  
Poland and he said that he can take, give some 
vi s as, you know?  To Swed
en. Swe den wa s taki ng i n  
people . And of course , I  ga ve --  
I was on the list with Irene beca us
e of Michal ™s aunt here. But  to 
tell you about the at mos pher e, t o go 
by tr ain t o Gdyni a, this
 is the  port of  Pol and. The r e we c oul d 
take the boat  to Swede n. Two wome
n, Poli sh wome n, we nt with us , 
we wi th chil dren . I t  was Cha na  
Fryshdor f, Gaby, and I was wit h Irene  in our , in ou
r train. I n ca se somet hi n g happe ns , ﬁThi s is their  
childr en,ﬂ because they were taking down peop
le from t h e trains and killing. So, once came  
some body to our a part me n
t with a gun and looking 
for s o me body. Lucki l y, it  was  a mi stake . You 
know, Bol ec k was at t hat  ti me; I wa s at that ti
me , Irene wa s asleep, it wa
s in the eveni ng. To kill 
somebody because 
they had some ki nd of acc
ount, who knows? But it wa
s very danger ous. Kielce. 
You know a bout Kielce?  Thi s was 1
946! We le ft  1946, the fi rst, t he 31
st
 of March, I think so. So 
this was very dangerous to live. 
So we had, it wa s  us, s o me Polish pe opl e to go with us  in case the  
childr en are not  thei rs. Alwa
ys the children and if th
ey ta ke us , okay, but  th
e childr en ar e there. So 
this is how it  was , you know, i n Pola nd.

And meanwhile, Sweden also
, I  was , you know, le arning Engli s

I nee d t o know the Engli sh. So
 a  wo ma n,  a Ger ma n wo man  wa s a

Q: Reall y? 

A: But this was British 
English. Another thing, wh

 this was the Ameri can 
Englis h and I learne d, I  
learne d Briti sh English. I  coul dn™
t spe ak, you know, but I was readi
ng a nd writi ng. So t his was als o,  
you know, what we did in Sweden
. So I  ca me  here a nd I br ought 
Gab y wit h me , wh ich wa s a ni ce 
thing, on the boat. At th
at time, in 1949, 
it was an order fr om the i
mmigration depart
ment that 
nobody can land in New 
York, only first have
 got to Ellis Island. This 
was order and no, even with 
visas , not only pa ssi ng by, c annot
 go. I di dn™t know ab
out it . Nobody t ol d  me
. Ga by wa s sec ure d, 
ﬁba mat ers (ph)ﬂ as her e, you know
?  She wa s legally, you know, her e. But I didn™t know a bout it at  
all. And dur i ng the pas sa ge, t her

ho really was with me
 constantly. She was 
goi ng on a regul ar, not a  legal visa , t o her sist er
 here . But she was s o, s h e was fr om a ca mp or

there wa s thi s chil d, you go fir st to

aft er tha t . This kind of t hi ng. And 
her sister wa s al so the r e whe n we 
arrived. They let t h e m c o me on 
the boat , you know, a boar d. So, a nd I  said t hat t he y 
ke ep her , t hey don™t le t  
her go, s he has t o go t o 
Ellis Island. From Ellis Is
land she can go to her sister. I wonder
ed why, but I coul
dn™t talk to her  
beca use I was the  ne xt one . So, Chana Fryshdor
f wa s th ere  wit h Bern a r d Gol dstei n  (ph) , was  
anot her  one, survi vor, als o.  
 

04: 46: 01 

 

And s o, fir st  of all, I clea r Ga by
. I sai d, ﬁ The mot her is here , s h
e ca n pi ck hi m up,ﬂ you know, t h e  
mother . And Ga by i s through
. Then I come a nd I s uppos ed t o g
o, Ga by shouldn™t have gone to Elli s  
Island as a child, but all the other 
pas sengers wit h  visa s, le gal visas ,
 had t o  go t o Ell i s I sland, fr o m  
Ellis Island they had to release th
em. Next, I come. So, I 
give my passport, a
ll these documents for 
cleari ng a nd he s aid, ﬁ N ow, you go to El lis I sla nd.
ﬂ He t alked fast. So I  
said to him,
 it was my  
khutspe, I s a id, ﬁ Y ou s pe ak ver y good Englis h but t
oo fa st.ﬂ He take t he st a mps , he put  ‚pass™ . Can  
you i ma gi ne  such a thi ng?  I was the only one wit h  
Irene who passe d. I f I woul d go t o El lis Isla nd, I  
wouldn™t be here today, because I 
onl y had 10 days and they
 send everybody out . In transit, I was in  
transit. But this is what
 I said, this is what works. My kh
utspe, I said, ﬁYou
 speak very good 
Englis h, but too fast .ﬂ I  didn™t  know
 what t his Ell i s Isla nd, I  didn™t  
know wh at he is
 talking about.  
And I got  sta mped ‚pass™ . So
 this is how I came here. 
Q: T o Ne w Yo rk?

apart ment  amal gamated. It™s a be
a ut i ful a part me nt but , you know, 
because they, they cared. The 
Jewish Labor Committee brought me
 over. So this is -- I had a 
very difficult time  here. The  
begi nni ng was ver y, I di dn™t know what to do a nd Irene
, first of all, you know, Irene, I was afrai d to 
leave her. The school , she was scar ed, she was very
 scared. See, we came 
in April, the 11th o f  
April, and Dr. Patt arranged for he

the teacher wrote about her. Here 
today came to our class a little gi

and a bow on top, you know. Ver y, very, very s w
eet, s o methi ng like that , 
you know. And she didn™t

you know, the fire alarm.  Yo u k
now, t he c hil dren r un out a nd I  
run out  be ca use I  was a fr aid, I heard i t , that s he™ll be
 scared and this girl was sc ared of this. Agai n,  
you know, because she kne w about th
e bombardi ng and t hat. She was 
ver y much s care d . It was not  
good for her, for me going away in
 that sens e. I st arted to wor k in the de si gni ng room beca use I wa s  
very good with my ha nd always . Wa s worki ng for a while and she wa

the be dr oom. We were sl eepi ng in
 t he  living room beca use t he rent
 was fi ft y doll a rs a nd I coul dn™ t  
spe nd the  50 doll ars . So I  was worki n g, se wing, a nd it
 was very di fficult, very
 difficult. And then I 
started t o work at t he YI VO,

, you know, because of
 the director of the YIVO. With the 
Conference of Cl aims , you know. They started to

 They need a pe rson  fo r the archives,

ﬂ He s aid no. He put his ar ms  
around me a nd sai d, ﬁI know y
ou ha ve a da ught er. You have no

And, ﬁThere is a good 
possibility for you.ﬂ There 
wa s 35 people in our plant. I wa
s shocked: ﬁWhy do yo

spoke to Dr. Patt. He was a very 
good friend of mi ne. 
Excellent fr iend who ta

 some friends . 
I really don™t 
know fr om where I took
 all the strength to get through all th
