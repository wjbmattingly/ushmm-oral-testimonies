Regina 
Spiegel was born May

th, 1926 in Radom ,Poland.  Herfather worked asa leather 
cutter to a large shoe m anuf acturer andherm other took care of their six children.  On 
this mapof  Europe, the arrow points Poland 
and on this m ap of  Poland, the arrow 
points to Radom .  On September
 
1, 1939, Germ an troops invadedPoland and 
Regina's town was attacked.  Like all Jews in Radom , Regina'sfam ily was ordered 

into a newly created ghetto.  Herparents decided to sm uggle her 
out  of  th e  ghe t t o b y 

bribing oneof  the guards.  SheescapedPionki where her soldier sister Rozia lived.  

Soon Regina was conscriptedforf orced labor in the town's munitions factory. T here 

she forked a close f riendship with Sam  Spiegel, a fellow inm ate.

was killed. W e closewith a photographof  Regina and

Upon Regina an
d Sam's arrival inW ashington, D.C. in late1947,Sam found work 
as a sheet metal worker and over tim e builta successful business in the construction 

industry.  Regina andSam have continuedto live in theW ashington, D.C. area since 

1947.
 
T hey have three
 
daughters andnine grandchildren, with the youngest being 
twel ve years old. Their f irst great

Regina's volunteer work for them useum includes working at the Donor's Desk, 
where you will f ind heronW ednesdays, with the exception of today. Sam  was an 
active volunteer at the m useum , buthis recent illness has pre
vented him  f rom 

continuing.  He spent a great deal of tim e working on the " Remember the Child W ho 

Perished"  program  which calls upon young Jews as part of  their BarandBat Mitzvahs 

to honor children whodied during the Holocaust. Sam searchedforthename
s  of  

children who perished, thenam eof  thetownfrom  which they cam e,and whenand 

where they perished.
 
Until recently, Regina andSam  hadparticipatedevery other year in the "March of 
the Living"  which took them to Auschwitz and Birkenau and other m ajor
 
camps, as 
well as to Israel inm ost years.  They went on11 " Marchesof  theLivi ng."
 
W ith that I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our First Person, Mrs. Regina

and I was a kid going to school, Ialwa ys f elt ver y comf ortable. I alwa ys f elt a lotof  
love f rom m y f am ily.  And I never had
 
to worr y aboutanything.  That's the way I 
looked at it.  Because I always f igured m y m other andm y father would take careof  it.  
T he only tim e when I got worried when I saw a 
--
 
it was on a Friday night and m y 
m other was busy preparing f orthe Shabbat. 
  
You know, we have like before we have 
a holiday alm ost like.  And so I came running tom y m other telling her what I saw 

outside.  I happened to beon the street. T hey were 
--
 
they took aman that was 
wearing a beard. I don't know.  Maybe he was nota religious man. But he was 

wearing a beard. Andyou know what?  I saw them  putting him  on the back of  the 

horses. And that wasscaredm ebecauseI cam e in running and telling this tom y 

m other.  My m other,Iguess sheprobably knew but she wanted 
--
 
she said, " Relax.  
Ever ything is going to be all right."
  
You know, they never wantedtotell their kidsthat 
a lotof  trouble is waiting for us.  Andbesides,I will tell you truthfully, my f ather wasn't 

so much concernedeither.  Becausehe happened to be dur
ing the First W orld W ar 
andthe Germ ans were in Polandtoo, they cam ethere.  Andhehadno problem with 

them . Sohef igured they can't be that strict.But,of  course, it was 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Regina, the Germ ans invaded Poland within a week af ter 
September
 
1st and cam eto your town of Radom.  You remember that,don't you?
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Oh, of course.  Becausethe way we li ved, we had a lot of 
people who lived in the same place and we were all neighbors andwe knew all the 

kids.  So we alwa ys m ade
 
good tim e with these things,everybody b y them selves.  
You lock the door andby yourself . T his isa com plete very different lif ef or us.

right awa y, didn't he?
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Not only m y f ather. All the Jews were not allowed to go to 
work.  T he kids were not allowed to go to school.  And we just couldn't understand.  
Because wef igured why not? W hy not go to school?  Andnow wh en I speak to 

young people, Ialways tell them to really be very happy that they have schools to go 

to. Because in ourplace the kids 
--
 
and they took these younger kids right awa y, they 
tookhim away.  And where they tookhim  wedidn'teven know.  And we alwa ys talk 

about certain things.  I alwa ys say the biggest 
--
 
what they did to thechildren were 
their worst place, you know.
  
Because the kids were the f irst victim s.  It was kids right 
away.
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wouldn't be long, would it,Regina, before youand your fam ily 
andother Jews in Radom  weref orced into aghetto.T ell us whathappened when 

they sent youto the ghetto?
 
>> Regina Spiegel: W ell, what is a ghetto?You know, to this 
--
 
you know, totry to 
tell you what a ghetto was, they took 
--
 
they chased usoutf rom our hom eand th
e y 
m ade pickedup rapidly f rom other homes and they put barbed wire around and this 

was the ghetto. W e couldn't takepractically anything with us.  So as a result, right 

away hunger sets in. When you cannot 
--
 
like here m y mother had just made a 
beautif u
l dinner.  Andwe weren't even 
--
 
we couldn't even 
ea t  
it.  Because right away 
they set onething after theother.  Andthey cam e out of it.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ithfood being sodiff icultand yourf ather,of  course, wasn't

>> Regina Spiegel: W ell, see, in Europe, you always had some kind of  thing, you 
know, andeverything had tobem adeof  thegood stuff. So let's say you had a 
bracelet.  Youhad whatever it was in gold.  My m other would barterwith the 

neighbors and she would give them one thing and they could give her som ething else. 

And that's the way we m anaged to go throughf rom  oneday to theother. Not too 

m uch, but that's what it would happen.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Regina, tell us about the role that your sister played in also 
helping tofeed thefamily.  Because your sister wasn't there with you.
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Yeah.  I had a sister who watched 
--
 
she was a dentist. And 
she lived in a smaller comm unity.  And she cam em arriage to 
--
 
andof  course she 
knew all the peoplef rom  that comm unity.  And the other comm unity was called Pionki. 

AndPionki helpedm e to survive.  Didn't helpthe rest of m yf am ily because that's 

where m y m other sentm e.  She sentm e.  But I didn't want to go.  I wanted to stay 

with thef am ily f oranything.  But I 
--
 
Idon't know why.  I had a sisterthat was two 
years older than I was.  And I kind of bargained with m y m other when she toldme I 

should go toPionki. And Ididn't want to leave.  She said," No, youare going."
  
And 
when m y m other saidyou are going, you had to go
, 
you know?  No,because this is 
nowadays I seem y kids with their children. My daughter will probably spend two 

hours explaining to her daughter why she can't doth
is  o r th is .
 
 
(Laughter.)
 
 
My m other just said"
Y
ou are going."
 
 
AndI could notexplain to this day.   You know, when If inally got out of  the ghetto, I 
wouldn't even say good
-
bye to her.  But thishelpedm e say during the war, I always

I have to see m y motherbecauseI didn't say good

I'll have to live to be able to say good

it .
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your mother selected you to gobecause you were the 
youngest child. So she wanted to save you.
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Iwas hoping that whenshe after the war thatwhen she 
--
 
when I could talk to her and ask her, I was hoping that I wouldf ind out.  But 
apparently, she saw som ething in me eventhough I was younger thanm y sister.  

M
aybe because I always, as I say, I never stood still.  I always run around places. I 
alwa ys jum ped on trees or whatever.
  
You know?  So I guess maybe that's why.  But 
m y m other justmadeup herm ind that I leavethe ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Regina, when your mother told youhad to leave the ghetto 
and goto your sister in Pionki, it wasn't just am atter of walking out ofthe ghetto.  How 

did you get out?
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  How?  T hat's interesting.  Because I don't even think about it.  
Because I didn
't have 
--
 
you had to 
--
 
it was quite a distance.  It wasabout 
30
 
kilom etersf rom ourplace, which was quite a distance.  But during that time, there 
was som ething in our 
--
 
in Poland that if  you traveled with an adult, your ticket 
--
 
you 
didn't have to h
ave aticket. So when I got out onthe train without any m oney and the 

conductor cam e to whether youhave the things to showing that youcan go, 

apparently, when I saw him ,I started 
--
 
therewas a lady sitting.  And I started talking 
to her.  So she just
 
--
 
he probably decided that I am probably with her.  And that's why 
he didn'teven askm efor a ticket oranything like this.  Andthat's how I managed to

get over to Pionki, to this other little town that's where m y sister lived.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So when
 
you got to Pionki toget to your sister, what happened 
then?
 
>> Regina Spiegel: W ell, I never realized wh at an important littletown Pionki was.   
You know, it had the largest m unitionfactory in Poland.  And theGerm ans wouldn't let 
this go because they
 
f igured they hit the jackpotbecausethey had right away people 
to get to work and they had peopleto start working with this m unitions.  It was 
--
 
I 
m ean, to shoot, you know.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Making bullets and things like that?
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Exactly.  And they used it.  And stuff likethat.  My sister, once I 
got tom y sisters, m y sister had ababy.  Thebaby was 18 months old.  And she gave 

him  away to afam ily.  But what happenedher neighbors, the lady's neighbors started, 

you know, saying you probably saving keeping a Jewish kid.  And you must have 

gotten very rich.  And I said," My sister, she didn't have m oney tomake 
--
 
not even 
m ake herself rich, to make anybody else rich."
 
  
I def initely knew she didn't have this kind of money.  So she had 
--
 
she gave the 
baby backand told them  where m y sister was.  And they came and they tookoutm y 

sister with the baby.  And they putthem on the wagons.  And they disappeared and 

we never saw them  again. T hat was 
--
 
af terthe war, I went to see that wom an
, 
because I was still a kid and Ididn't understand. So she was actually the one that she 

explained tom e the way that she took thebaby, because the baby was looked like an 

Aryan child because that's what they were looking f or.  You know, Aryan children
.   He 

had long blond hair and you know nothing 
--
 
he was really 
--
 
he was  a gorgeous baby.

So when I cam e to her and I talked with heraf ter the war, I r

I was trying not tobehateful tothe wom anbecauseIf igured, look, 
when 
sh e
 
to o k th at

can't always keep what you think you canm ake.  AndI understoodand we actually 

hada very nice gathering.  And lateron, of  course, I went to a different place. So that 

wa s  i t.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So Regina, you now lost your sister, you're alone inPionki.  You're 
doingf orced labor in Pionki. W hile you were there, youm et yourf uture husband,

was al ways I don't have

I wish I would have theenergy that I had then.  I was

it turned out that he becamem y husband.  But

And he said, " I know you."
 
  
I said, " You know m e?"  So I started askinghim "
A

I said, "W here are you f rom?" He toldm ethe nam e Kozienice. I told him  I'dnever

her and she andthe baby were shot.   You know, this was
 
a horrible time. I hate to 
talk about it.  I know I have to talkabout it.  Becausepeoplehave toknow what it was.  
But I, m yself ,don't like to talk about it.  Because you wouldn't believe it because I'm  

here, you know, for many years.  I've beenhere, that I wouldbe likethat.  But Ialways 

kind off elt like how com e that Iam  still walki ng around, you know?  And so many 

people and yourf riends.   You know, everybo dy 
--
 
you turned around, they were gone.  
T hey were gone.  Sothis was the tim e.
 
>> B i l
l Benson:  If I rem em ber right, Regina,as you got to know Sam , them en 
were on one side of the cam pand the wom en and there was som ebarbed wire and 

there was a water spigot and you would talk to each otherand that's how you got to 

know each other.  Butconveniently as the Russians got closer, they closeddown 

P io n k i.
 
>> Regina Spiegel:  Yes, they closedup thiscam p.  Andthat's the tim e whenSam  
cam e to me to tell m e "
L
ook, if  we ever get out 
--
 
"  because he was four years older 
than I was.  So he understood a little bit m ore than I did.  And he told me, he said, 

" Look, this is no play thing.  You rem em berthat youhave tobe caref ul because there 

are a lot of Germ ans around here.  And youhave to try to stay away f rom  them."
 
  
And I guessI learned m y lesson pretty good.  And my boyf riend then, he

he and I 
were picked to go to a place called T reblinka.   You know, Treblinka, do I have

I 
don't

in, that's what they did.  They tookaway ever ything.  T hey took away your clothes. I

--
 

andthis was in m y m ind always.  I have to live through because you could almost give 

up. But when you wer e

dependenton you.  Maybe you m ade af riendwith som ebody.  And youm ight be also 

kind of hoping that she doesn't do anything that is not very good foryou.  SoI becam e

it ' s  it ' s  
probably

Andalso after this I went to another cam p.  You see, I was lucky.  Not that I was 

sm art. But you see atthat tim e, the Germ ans were you know, they had gottena little 

--
 
a lot of the Russians were com ing closer and they have also start thinking about 
their own things.  So som etimes insteadof  killing us, they decided why should we kill 

them ? They're such good people that they do such wonderf ul work, wh y not keep 

them ? W ealways have time to kill them . And that's what they did. T hey used that to 

the last m inute. And that's when we

you know, that's why a lot

I want you to know

I said this is something

that way.  Because if not, they'll never get out of  there.  And thank God, eventually we 

did make it.
  
You know?

because I will tell  you truthfully, 
when I was liberated, and when If oundout that allm y f am ily is practically gone, the 

only one I had abrother who happened to be in the Arm y.  Andhe was goneas well.  

Andhem anagedto get away, you know, getaway.  But all the others, they were 

killed.  Because you didn't

they didn'tbelieve in keeping

Belsen. Tell us what that was like.

Belsen was aplace that you were lucky if  you could 
get up. It was the same thing, you know.  They were constantly over you.  They 

looked outf or you. Never

you had tom anage practically your whole life by yourself .  
And if  you would know m ost of us were young people and we didn't know if

I didn't know they showed me what to

they 
were digging the ditches all of a sudden we see airplanes.  And they started throwing 

bombs. W efigured hey, this is not Germanbom bs. T his isAmerican.  Andactually, 

we were hit by
 
the Americans but thank Godfor that because the Germ ans ranaway, 
you know, and we could kind of

Im ean some of the people got killed because you 
know when they don't know where to stop.  But we were able to runaway into, we 

saw across there were woods.  And we ran into the woods. And we f igured we'd stay 

thereuntil we can kindof

It would be

it was wonderful. But you know what? W e didn't have to worr y any 
m ore.  Because at that tim e we all ran into the woods because we didn't want to even 
want Am erican planesto hitus. So whathappens when we were running, I see in the 

distancef araway a soldier and he looked.  He didn't look like he was a Germ an 

because hisuniform  was different.  So I run over to him and I couldsee thathe 

happenstobe Russian.  And you know, I suppose 
--
 
but I remember m y parents 
apparently were 
--
 
you know, during that time, you know, sometimesthey used t
he  
Russian words or something like this.  And I ran over tohim and I said tohim actually 

in Russian (Russian word) I knew thatm eantf riend. I said you areRussian? He said, 

" Ye s . "
 
   
 
Andhe said go into the woods. T ell all the wom en to com eout. W e
 
were like 
about 300 womenf rom the

know?  He said, "W eheard you."
 
  
 
You know, you m adea little bit toom uch noise because we were hiding.  So I said 
what did you want us to do?  Weare only wo m en.  300 womenby ourselves we have 

tom ake som e kind ofnoise. Sohe said

and actually, he told us you are

the war 
is over.  You aref ree.  I looked at him . W earef ree? W hat am  I supposed to do now?  

You know?  Because you know what?  I sat down

I 
m ean, Ididn'tsit down, but I 
stood up and I started counting m y agef or thef irst time Iever looked at m y age.  I 

said, " How old am I now?"  Anddo you know I realized I was alm ost,like, 19 years old.  

And here he tells me that I'm  liberated.  And actua

Inever celebrated that

But as I say, we were liberated. And we asked him what should wedo. W estill didn't

walkin g, we m anagedto stop at som efarmer's and they gave us som ething.  Andalso 

it  wa s  lik e  we

when they realized who they helped, they said," Don't worr y.  People

Because I walked in to a bakery to ask the

askedhim  in Germ an. He saiddo youhave any m oney?  I said whohasm oney?  

W hat are youtalking?  I didn't even know thatthis kindof  stuff existed.  And really in a

he was on them arch
,  
on one of 
the m arch
e
s which they called the deathm arch.  Andthen they stoppedbecausethe 
Germ ans hadto stop som etimes to take a rest, too. So whenthey stopped,
 
m y 
boyf riend at the time, he ranaway and he wasn't toof arf rom Poland.  So he knew 
thatearlier and he ran away and got, actually, to Poland. And lateron, when we 

f inally m ade connection, what he told me that he was staying there,I said why?  I 

can't
 
stay here because I have to gopeople tof ind m y mother.  And, of  course, there

wonderful 
girls.  I m ade a lif ef or m yself  instead of killing m yself , which I wouldn't have 
done goodtoanybody except probably to theGerm ans.  For us, it was a way out.  

W henever they told any of  us that we would ever be abletohave children we never

because 
they always 
--
 
you know, they use so m any things onus that we alwa ys 
thought that they probably did som ething to so we couldn't even have any children.  

But apparently, it wasn't so. So we accusedthem of  som ething thatwasn't

don't know.  I gave him probably m ore than they deserve.  But you know
, I a lwa ys

a result, it wasn't so easy to have, you know,T om ,m y oldest brother, ifhem ade 

som e money, he saved it form y sister so she could go to school.  I m ean, it wasn't 

that you send three children at the sam etimeto school. It was rather hard. It was a 

hard place to live in, really.  So I

the only way I wanted to do is go back

out that I got sick, you know, thatthere was som ething wrong with m y arm s. I couldn't 
touch m y arm s like the blood was somethingwrong with it.  Idon't know wh y.  But 

that's what I had. And when I went tothe hospital, they every week they put me 

together with m y uncle.  Except I will tell you he puta net in
 
the Jewishf our words.  
My uncle never left. So it took som ebody that lived in this place who cam ef rom our

look in thepapers.  Your

what did she callm e?  You

And you know what? W ithin, like,four days m y uncle had gottenf or m epapers.  
And that's how I was able to go.  Iturned aroundtom y boyf riend and I said, "W ell,this

you can see the typeof  a personI had that,m ostof us, survivors of Auschwitz, you 

think we always go down with ourf aces andnever be happy.  No, it's different way.  

Because we thinkof  gratitude.  Not violence.W emust reject indiff erence.  You see, 

indiff erence,that's where we shouldn't even think about.  But we shouldn't be 

indiff erent. W hen you see people being

I alwa ys tell the kids, you know, we just

have done
