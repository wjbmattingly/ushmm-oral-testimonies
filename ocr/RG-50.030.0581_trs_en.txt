Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holoca ust Memorial 
interview with Dr. 
Joseph 
Eato n, 
conducted by 
Judith Cohen
 and 
Steven Luckert
 on May 27
th
, at the 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum
. Dr. 
Eaton
, can you start by giving 
your first name as it appeared or
iginally, as you were named in 
Germany
, your 
name in 
Germany
 an d why don™t you give us the 
names of your immediate family 
as well? 
Answer: All right. I was born as 
Joseph Wexler 
in 
Nuremberg, Germany
 in  Œ not 
in a hospital, because it wasn™t safe to 
go to  hospital, if you could afford to have 
delivery at home. So  I was born in 
Luxfeld
(ph) three, across the park. My father 
was 
Jacob Wexler
, and  my  mo ther 
Flora Go ldschm idt Wexler
. And I have th ree 
brothers, 
Siegfried
 was his first name, and later he changed it to 
Shlo mo
. 
Ma rtin
 to 
Moeshe
(p h) and 
Herbert 
to 
Yitzhak
(ph). And I was
 
born on September 28
th
, 1919. 
After the war, when there was a great shorta
ge of food, and my father had to work 
very hard to get milk
 from peasants near 
Nuremberg
, because you couldn™t get 
enough fo r a baby.  

Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your 
early life, pre-Nazi takeover? Life in the 
20s, both your father™s profession, fa
mily™s religious affiliation, Jewish 
communo
(ph) affiliation, schooling.

A: My parents always had to rent a place.
 They did not own an ap artment and they 
always looked for a place to rent near 
a park, so that it would be easy for the 
children to go there and play. 
They were sufficiently well o
ff for my mother to have 
one or two household helps, 
because in those days you didn™t have dishwash ers, and 
you couldn™t go to the gr-gro cery store a
nd get prepared food, 
so it was a lot more 
work  to feed four children and a husband. 
My father was the firs
t in his family to 
break away from the pattern of being a petty
 merchant selling a Œ running a store to 
provide clothing and dry goods. He was ab
le to purchase a factory, manufacturing 
shaving brushes, something 
we don™t use any mo re toda
y. And he was married in 
1912, shortly after the sinking of th e 
Titanic
. And so I still rememb er in our home, 
there was a memento to the pi Œ 
Tita nic
, because that was an 
event that apparently 
affected a lot of people. And shortly afte
r he purch ased the factory, World War II Œ 
World War I broke out, and he and his brot
hers Œ he had four
 brothers Œ three 
brothers Œ were drafted. And my  father se
rved in the German ar
my for fouryears, 
and was very upset and resentful over the 
amount of anti-Semitism he experienced. 
Q: Can you describe what sort
 of anti-Semitism he noticed? 
A: Well Œ well, what I do remember, his te
lling me about the complaint that too 
many Jews were trying to get out of 
serving in the army . So, the German 
government decided to have a census 
of how many Jews were serving in the

German army. When the findi
ngs were that the Jews we
re overrepresented in the 
army, the results were not published, not 
until the late 20s. But Œ so he was drafted 
as a private and ended his serv
ice as a private, as did most
 Jews. I mean, if you were 
a physician or a dentist, you might become
 an officer, but by and large Jews were 
not considered qualified to be
 in combat, and so he spen
t his period of time in the 
transportation sy stem, which 
meant looking after horses, 
because that was the main 
vehicle transportation. So, I rememb er th
ese things, I™m sure, not when I was Œ 
before going to primary school. Bu t I ha
d always someone, a Œ a caretaker, looking 
after the smaller children, or taking us to
 an  aunt and uncle™s house, who had a child 
my age. So this 
is how I lived in 
Nuremberg
, but I do not recall having any non-
Jewish German friends. 
Q: What sort of school did you attend? 

A: What? 

Q: What sort of elementary school did you attend? 
A: Well, I went to a parochial school, 
of which Œ of the Jewish community. We 
lived there, nearby, walking distance, and 
I do remember being attacked sometimes 
by other kids, ger Œ who didn™t
 like Jewish kids, and you ha
d to fight. And so I went 
to this school, which was not a very good 
school; we had, I would say, very poor 
teachers. And I was kind of a rebellious, prob
lematic ch ild. I would talk back to the 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
May 27, 2010 
 

 
 
6
teachers sometimes. A nd at one point, a te
acher called me a donkey. And so I said, 
well if I am a donkey, you are a monkey . And the teacher was so upset. And finally 

my  parents bribed  me to apologize, even 
though I Œ they agreed 
I Œ it was justified 
for me to talk back. But as soon as Œ af
ter four years, I went to high school, 
gymnasium as in Œ they call it in German. 
And in  the middle of that year, that was 
in 1933, the government decided that no Je
wish child should be 
allowed to go to a 
gymnasium, and so I was notified that
 I could not continue, in 1934. 
Q: Let me step back a little bit. Before ™
33, how aware of you 
what Œ were you of 
the political unrest that was going on in 
Nuremberg
? Did you witness any political 
rallies? 
A: Well, strange is, I do rememb er being ve
ry  interested in what was going on, and 
reading th e newspapers. Now, of course
, I had two older brothers, who were 
educationally very active, so I would say 
at age eight and nine, I was very mu ch 
aware of elections, and the propaganda in
 elections and the Nazi party, and the 
Nationalists, who were close to the Nazis. 
So certainly I have very vivid memo ries 
of 1932 and 1933. Bu t I do not recall ever feeling frightened. 

Q: When the results of the plebiscite we
re announced in  ™32, and th ey announced 
that 
Hitler
 had won, wh at was the immediate 
reaction in your family? Did people 
take it serio u sly?

A: Well, my father at that point lost his job, because the company for which he w Œ 
he had to give up his business because of 
the depression. It was based in Œ a lot on 
export of shaving brushes to other European
 countries, and he had traveled a great 
deal to different countries, and as a resu
lt I became a stamp collector. But he lost his 
business because in the depression there ju
st wasn™t enough, so
 he worked for a 
comp any selling their c Œ shavin g brushes. A
nd he lost the job. And I reme mb er in 
19 Œ you know, in January 
and February  1933, wh en 
Hitler
 came into power, that 
this was pretty bad, but we didn™t think 
it was a catastrophe. It wouldn™t last, after 
all, the Nazi party was not a majority, but close to it. And I remember my father, for 

example, printing advertisements to ann
ounce that he was making men™s suits to Œ 
for measure. He hired tailors to do the wo
rk, and he would find
 customers and take 
their measu rements and sell tailor made cl
othing, wh ich in those days was a very 
common thing, I mean, you didn™t have 
the mass production. And so he had 
advertisements printed, and wh en I was out 
of school or had a da
y off, I would take 
these ads and put them 
into mailboxes. My first job. 
So he, even though there was a 
Nazi boycott, he continued 
to try and sell, although gr
adually the business stopped, 
because it was dangerous and counterprod uctive for Germans to do business with 
any Jew. So , in 1934 -™35, he eff
ectively ceased ha
ving an income. 
Q: Now, did you witness any of the 
Nuremberg 
rallies in  the first year? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

A: No, no I Œ I was aware of them. I was aware of the
 Stürmer 
newspaper, that 
came out every week , but the Jewish youth 
groups to which I belonged, a religious 
Zionist group called 
Esba
(ph) continued to function. We
 went on hiking trips and Œ 
and at that time, while I do remember th
e boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1
st
, 
1933, being surprised how ma
ny businesses were Jewish. So this Œ a friend walking 
around th e city, I said, good God, these 
are Je w Œ all Jewish, because they were 
being boycotted, but I wasn™t have a Œ didn
™t have a sense of fear. And once on a 
hike, a group of Nazi 
SS
 troops told us we had to break up camp  and go back  home. 
But again, no sense of fear that anything 
would happen to me. 
So, I was spared the 
frightening experiences of Je
ws after 1937 - ™38, wh en there was a great deal of 
physical abuse. There were some Jews a
rrested in ™33, and a few were killed in 
concen tration camps, but I didn™t Œ my  fami
ly didn™t know any of them, so that I 
would say Œ wh en I left 
Germany
 I never had experienced 
the sense of physical 
fear, because that came later. 
Q: Let me go back, wh en you mentioned th
at you were expelled from school, can 
you sort of describe that da
y, how you found out 
that you were no longer allowed to 
attend the gymnasium, how you f
illed up your days afterwards? 
A: Well, that is interesting.
 In high school, there was a 
complete shift, because since 
I Œ I was a fairly good student, very  go
od student in fact, 
but had very bad

relationships with the teachers, who foun
d that I asked too ma
ny questions and you 
know, there were all kinds of religious inst
ruction and I wasn™t quite sure, and asked 
questions. So, we had proble
ms. So when I went to 
high school, everything 
changed. I was a good student, the stude
nt Œ the teachers 
liked me. When the 
teachers ran out of booklets fo
r examinations, he would send me to a store nearby to 
pick them up. And I remember one time he
 says, oh you can™t go to this store, 
because it™s owned by a Jew, you 
have to go to that store. I didn™t like that, but Œ I 
was well regarded  in the school, and one da
y found out that Œ that all Œ not only I, 
but other Jewish children had to leave, 
and Œ well, that™s 
politics. The Jewish 
community Œ by that time I lived in 
Berlin
, my  family had moved to 
Berlin
, and 
there they had a very good
 Jewish school, whose teachers, many of them were 
college professors who had lost their j
obs, who later on sometimes became quite 
famous individually, as scholars in 
Israel
 or in the 
United Sta tes
. So, I went for 
one year to a Jewish high school in the suburb of 
Berlin
 called 
Grünewald
, from 
which, by the way, th e Jews of 
Berlin
 were deported from that place. And so  I 
would say I did not, as I said, I Œ I kne
w wh at was going on, be
cause I listened to 
the news, and read th e newspapers and talk
ed to friends about wh at was happening. 
Q2: Can I just interject a question? 
Nuremberg
 had the odious dis
tinction of having 
Julius Streicher 
as the 
gauleiter, 
the Nazi leader of Œ of 
Franconia
, and also the

publisher of ﬁ
Der Stürmer,
ﬂ and I was just wonderi
ng, you know, about how 
visible was ﬁ
Der Stürmer
ﬂ Œ 
A: Very visible. 
Q: Œ and Œ and what 
kind of response did it generate among Œ 
A: I mean, since I didn™t have any Germ
an friends Œ I mean, we had a German 
maid, two German ma ids, we never talked 
about that. I didn™t talk to German Œ non-
Jewish German kids. You read the fr Œcrazy, outrageous stories every week. I 

mean, I didn™t buy the paper, but I looked at
 the newsstand, at the front page. And 
well, this is Nazi, this is Œ you s Œ you s 
Œ you grew up, you lived  with this as part 
of the realities of life. Late
r on wh en I studied the history of my  family, prior ge Œ 
generations also had to sort of take the fa
ct th at there was anti-
Semitism for granted, 
the way minorities today live in so many co
untries where there is govern mentally 
supported discrimination. But, we talked 
about it at home, and I think my  parents 
decided, because of the history of all th
is, that there was no future for us in 
Germany
, as early as 1933. Whereas so man y
 German Jews thought this would 
pass the way it had always passed, and th
ey  delayed making a decision to  leave. 
Q: Okay , let™s talk about the decision to em
igrate. Now, who is the first memb ers of 
your family to leave 
Germany, 
and wh at prompted them to go where they did, and 
Œ

A: Well, since my father ha
d to go Œ went backrump t Œ 
bankrupt wh en the factory 
could no longer sell enough, we didn™t 
have the financial means to get an 
immigration visa from 
[indecipherable]
 countries, because in the early 30s there 
was a depression all over the world. No
body wanted immigrants. It was very 
difficult to get visas, so it became clear that
 it would be very unlikely to be able to 
emigrate. We actually had 
distant relatives in the 
United States
 who emigrated in 
the 19
th
 century, but my father 
didn™t know about them, 
because they were, you 
know, three or four generations back. So my
 tw o older brothers 
decided not to have 
an academic career, but to become 
Halutzim
 or physical laborers and go to 
Palestine
. And they succeeded.  
Q: And what year was that? 
A: ™35 and ™36. And there was an oppo
rtunity for children 
to come to the 
United 
States
 under a special program to finish sc
hool, and then return home, hopefully. 
And my  parent decided, with much discussi
on in Œ within the larger family, to send 
my  younger brother, who was 12,
 and me, who was 14 to the 
United States
 under 

this program where, in foster homes, we 
would finish our educa
tion. And they  were 
able to emigrate to 
Holland
. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit about this program.
 Can you Œ a-actually want to go in two 
different directions, cause I want to ta
lk about your parents™ emigration to  
Holland
. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

But first, can you describe the program th
at you were under; wh
o subsidized it, was 
this through the Jewish co
mmunity, was it general, what political ramifications 
were there? 
A: Well, we all know historically that President 
Roosevelt
 took very little action to  
help the Jews of 
Germ any
. He had a congress that 
was not willing to change 
immigratio n laws. And within the 
Department of State, and in 
Ca na da
 as well, the 
bureaucracy felt, whatever immig rants we 
get, we don™t need Jews. And so they  
made it esp ecially difficult for Jews to  get papers, unless 
they had very good 
connections in the 
U.S.
 and 
Ca nada
. But, under pressure, 
Roosev elt
 agreed to 
commit, I don™t know how many, whether 
it was 2,000 or 20,000 children from 
Germany
 to come to the 
United States
 under a guarantee of the Jewish community  
that they would not become a burden to
 the welfare system. It was called the 
German Jewish Children™s Aid Society. An
d I think my  younger brother was on the 
first group, and I came a week 
later on the second group Œ 
Q: What year and month was that? 
A: Œ traveling on the 
S.S. Ha rding
. And while it was upsetting, I Œ I felt, and my  
parents reinforced this, this was a tempor
ary th ing, and that we wo uld be reunited 
after they got out of the co
untry. And so I landed the da
y befo re Thanksgiving of 
1934, in 
New York
, and was temporarily picked up to the home of one of the 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

13
officers of the German Jewish Ch
ildren™s Society, a attorney, 
John L. Bernstein
. 
And then  later on to Œ went to an other foster home. 
Q: I want to come back later and ask 
you about what it was like living in the 
United 
States
 without parents, but why don™t we ju
mp  over to your parents. After you and 

your siblings all left
, where did they go? 

A: Well, actually, my parents™ marriage was 
Œ did not come Œ it sort of deteriorated 
as he lost his business. My mother was an 
intellectual. H e was interested in things, 
but really did not share her intellectual 
interest s. And so the marriage was not a 
good marriage, but I didn™t 
know about that. My older br
others did, and they  did 
divorce and emigrated to 
Holland
 separately. And my father found another 
girlfriend and th ey emigrated together, also to 
Amsterdam
. So it was a congenial 
divorce. There wasn™t much to argue abou t in 1936, although emotionally this was a 

very difficult thing for my 
mo ther. But she got a good deal of support from her 
family and her sisters. So Œ howeve
r, there was a tremendous amount of 
correspondence between member
s of the family. I have letters, ab out this many, 
with my parents, my mothe
r, my father, my brothers a
nd we kept the letters. So, 
over the years, my  brothers gave me the 
letters, because I was the only one in th e 
family who showed  interest, and of cour
se, the only one who could read German. 
So I have a tremendous collection of letters, 
and I have to  decide wh at to do with 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

14
them, because I don™t think I have the tim
e right now to go thro
ugh them. But they 
present a great deal of day to day informa
tion of how a normal refugee family dealt 
with the realities of emigration, adjustme
nt, what Œ interrelati
onships. Today this 
would never happen. People might communica
te by email, but in those days, letter 
writing was the only means of communica
tion. And it meant having Œ spending 
money on postage, which for 
my  parents was not easy. So , 
most of the letters, th-the 
Œ every in ch  of the paper was filled with 
words. In other words, you didn™t have any 
margins, to save money. 
Q: What was Œ how late were you ab
le to keep up the correspondence? 
A: Til 1941. Til 
Germany
 and the 
United States
 declared war, since the 
U.S.
 was Œ 
we c Œ so we couldn™t Œ I have letters from ™4 0 and ™41 from 
Holland
. And we 
didn™t have the money to te
lephone. I didn™t have the money, and they didn™t have 
the money, because in those days, to make
 a long distance call was very expensive. 

Q: Let me Œ oh Œ 
Q2: Wh at did your parents 
do when they got to the 
Netherlands
? 
A: Well, my mother took care of elderly 
people who need ed so
me support. So she 
was basically a health aide of elderly peop le, and they  were all deported, of course, 

after the Nazis came, although
 my mother was able to es
cape to a village, and hid 
there for a while until a local Nazi gave he
r away, and they arrested her. So the Œ 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

my  father learned dry cleaning, he took a course in 
Amsterdam
 on how to dry 
clean. And even though th
ey had no permit, no work i
ng permit, but to be a 
household aide, you really di
dn™t need a permit. That™s 
Œ it™s the kind of job that 
nobody wanted, so my mo ther could wo
rk . And my  father was doing busin Œ I 
guess, also extra-legally, but the Dutch appa
rently didn™t enfor
ce the restrictions 
with such efficiency, and Œ 
I mean, they didn™t have any Œ mu ch  money and they 
may even have gi Œ been given some
 support by th e Jewish commu nity in 
Amsterdam
, but I don™t know those details. They
 didn™t write about it, and I didn™t 
ask about it. Okay. 
Q: I want to ask you now, what it wa s like for a young boy, 14 years old I 
remember, to live with a fost
er family that he had never met before, and wh at was 
your adju stment learning E
nglish, learning a new educational system, learning a 
new family.  
A: Well, I didn™t feel really comfortable 
in any of the homes, but felt I had to Œ I 
was grateful, and I had to be accommodative.
 The first fast Œ foster home family 
were Œ was a wealthy family living on 
Central Park West 
in 
New York City
 in a 
big apartment. They  had three daughters. And so they  felt having a boy in th e 
family would be a good idea
. But they were very Orthod
ox, and I found my self at 
that time becoming more and mo re estrange
d to Orthodoxy, and they noticed that, 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
May 27, 2010

so I was moved to an other family, the son of the Rabbi 
de So la
 
Pool
, the head of 
Shearith
 
Israel 
of the Sephardic synagogue in 
New York City
, who was a sort of 
son of a famous father who 
wasn™t doing quite so well, so it was difficult for him. 
He was a salesperson for different comp anies, but never quite made it in the 
corporate world, and they 
had one son, a little younger 
than I, and Œ almost the 
same age, and th at created problems, because he was doing 
okay in school, but I 
was academically outstanding. And so  I think that created problems for 
Richard 
Mindas
(ph). I didn™t have any problems with 
him, but we didn™t become close. And 
Œ but I went first to a 
New York 
school, the 
Jefferson
 High School in 
Brooklyn
. 
And there, fortunately, they had a good sp
eech departme nt. So 
the speech therapist 
took an interest in me, and helped me to learn  to sp
eak English properly. So I got a 
lot of special instruction, 
and my capacity to 
speak English and to  spell and so on, 
developed rather quickly, so that when  la
ter on, before I graduated, I actually got 
better grades in English than most of my 
fellow students, because I had to learn the 
language and th erefore was mo re careful 
with spelling. So actually, I graduated 
from 
White Plains 
High School at the age of 16, 
because I got credit by taking 
examinations in wo rld history and Europe
an  history. I had to learn American 
history, I had to learn English, but 
math and geography, I passed the Regents 
Exams, so that I graduated early and 
went to college at
 the age of 16.

Q: And who paid for your college? Was 
the German children™
s aid still supporting 
you at this point? 
A: I first w ent to a free Œ to the 
New York City™s 
high s Œ City Co llege, because 
that was free. But after one year
 got a scholarship to go to 
Cornell
. And I also got a 
scholarship for maintenance from Œ through the German Jewish Children™s Aid 

from some one of the 
Woberg
(ph) family. Because one of their daughters who was 
active in the Zionist movement met me a
nd I was so knowledgeab
le about what was 
going on in the 
Middle East
, she decided to  get the family to send me to 
Cornell
. 
And I also met the president of 
Hadassah
, because her son went to a summer camp  
to which I was invited. So that I had co
nnections, thro ugh my  knowledge of what 
was going on in  the Jewish wo rld. I did a lo
t of reading. I had a nephew by marriage 
of my father, who was a professor at the 
theological semi nary. So  I had contacts 
with the academic world at the age of 15 
and 16 and 17 that re
sulted in my having 
contacts among th e Jewish leadership elite, including Rabbi
 Pool
, whose wife also 
became president of 
Hadassah
. And at one point I wa
s invited by Justice 
Brandeis
 
to meet with him in his home here in 
Washington
, because he was interested  in 
cooperative farming and kibbutzim. And by 
that time I had a job to do research in 
that field. 

Q: What were you studying at 
Cornell
? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

A: At 
Cornell
, I first thought of becoming a Œ a 
physician who was taking care of 
animals, I Œ 
Q: A veterinarian? 
A: A what? 
Q: A veterinarian? 

A: A veterinarian. I really had very poor 
advice, in terms of making choices. I had 

no one to talk to. 
But when I got to 
Cornell
 and took a course in animal husbandry, 
I came to the dec Œ quickly to
 the decision that I was not the right person to help 
cows and horses deliver their offspring. A
nd also, I took a course 
in rural sociology. 
And there I wrote a term paper on the kibbutz movement, simp ly from what you 
read in the newspapers a
nd knew from my  brothers in 
Isr ael
. And the professor 
liked the paper so mu ch Œ he 
happened to be the editor of
 rural sociology, so it got 
published. So at Œ as a junior at 
Co rnell
, I was a pub Œ I had a publication in a Œ in 
Œ in a well-known journal, and that made 
a big difference in my  subsequent career. 
And that™s how Justice 
Brandeis
 heard about me and whose interest in 
Palestine
 
and its economic development was a private, 
but very great intere
st. And so I think, 
through Mrs. 
Epstein
, somehow he heard about me and he invited me to come to 
see him on a Sunday mo rning. 
Q: What was your impression of him?  

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

A: Well, he obviously knew an aw ful lo
t, and I really di
dn™t have en ough of 
understanding of the signifi
cance of being invited by a memb er of the Supreme 
Court, to fully be amazed at this Œ you 
know, this was, for me, a normal thing that 
happens. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 I™m trying to do th e math. You came to the 
United States
 at 
14, you graduated at 16, so we™re 
talking now Œ it™s about ™39 Œ ™40? 
A: That™s ri ght, I gradu Œ graduated in 1940. 
Q: And I want to ask you, how aware 
were you of wh at 
was going on back in  
Euro pe
? What sort of news were you gettin
g about the start of World War II, how 
much news was filtering? 

A: I was very much aware, I mean, readi
ng Eng-English, being able to read in 
German, my parents wouldn™t Œ would write
 once or twice a week. I would write 
back, not often, make copies of my  letters
, so I Œ my  letter writings not only have 
their letters, but my responses.
 And mu ch of that is also true of my  brothers. So, 
even corresp ondence w
ith my  grandmother, who remained in 
Frankfurt
 because 
she didn™t think the Nazis would bother an
 older lady, and so she was not willing to 
leave the country when
 everybody else left.  She had 
a nice home, and so  on. So I 
was very mu ch aware. I would say I was mo re aware of what was going in  
Europe
 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

than mo st people, and prob
ably as much aware of 
what was going on as my 
teachers. 
Q: And was there any mobilization on the 
part of the American Jewish community 
at this point, in ™39, after the invasion of 
Poland
, for relief efforts, that you saw? 
A: Well, I was aware of the tremendous sens
e of frustration of the American Jewish 
community. But on the other hand, I wa
s aware of the complexities of the 
leadership. I mean, lik e Rabbi 
Wise
, who had good relationship with 
Roosevelt
, 
and so he had to be very ca
reful in open criticism of the 
Department of State. I was 
aware of the American Jewish committee
 and their ambivalence about being too 

supportive of the Zionists, because after 
all, we Jews are religion rather than a 
nationality, and I was very much identifie
d with the idea that Jews are both a 
religion and a nationality. And so I would 
say I had a quite advanced knowledge, 

not only wh at was going on in the 
U.S.
 or in 
Germany
, or in much of the rest of 
Euro pe
, wh at was going on in the 
Soviet Union
. When I was at 
Corn ell
, there was 
a pretty active commu nist youth group, and 
I was among the Jewish kids who were 
very mu ch  opposed to the 
Soviet Unio n
, because of Œ ev en though they seemed to 
be wi Œ quite progressive, th
ey were a dictatorship. A
nd so I was active in the 
Hillel 
Society and that group was 
very mu ch opposed to the 
Sov i et Unio n
, whereas there

were a lot of Œ not a lot, but there was 
a sufficiently active group of students at 
Corn ell
 that felt that th e 
Soviet Union
 had the solution to  mankind™s future. 
Q: What sort of activities was 
your group, th e Zionist group at 
Hillel
 doing? 
A: Well, first of all, we were very critical of the 
Soviet Unio n
; of its dictatorship, 
the concentration camps, the labor camps, 
Stalin
. We did not think they are 
progressive. There were lots of argumen
ts. And so , I had friends among the an ti-
communists, but you know, I did become 
a Republican as a result, b u t I was 
politically active, and one of my friends wa
s a Iraqi Jew. The only Jew ever sent by 
the Iraqi government, on a scholarship ofthe government. They  every year sent 
over some students to get an American degree, and 
Ma yer
(ph) 
So fay a
(ph )  w a s th e 
only one who was Jewish who they  ever sele
cted. And so we became very friendly, 
and through him I learned a lot of what wa
s going th rough th e Arab world, an d I did 
Œ was invited to his wedding in  
Eg ypt
 in 1945, and actually 
went to the wedding. I 
didn™t get there on time, but I actually met him in 
Cairo
, in Œ at the end of 1945, 
and that another interes
ting story, how knowing him 
enabled me to come to 
Palestine 
in 1945.  

Q: We™ll get to that. Now, I just want to ch
eck, your official stat
us at this point is 
you™re still a German citizen, or 
were you officially stateless? 
A: No, I was a German  citizen.

Q: And so how did the 
United States™
 entry into World War II, let™s go to 
Pearl 
Harbor,
 what were the rami
fications for you? 
A: Well, you have to keep in mind that
 when  I went to graduate school, I was 
accepted at the school of social work ka Œ at 
Chicago University
. And in the first 
semester, where I had a job selling clothes in
 a men™s clothing store, I suddenly was 
offered a job in 
New Yo rk City
 to set up a research institute on cooperative 
farming. So I left 
Chicago
, and found my self at the age of 21, or Œ 
[file break] 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

Q: This is the 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum
 with 
Joseph Ea to n
, 
conducted by 
Judith Cohen 
on August 31
st
 Œ August first in 
Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania
. It™s a continuation of the interv iew begun at the Holocaust Museum 
in June. Okay, when we left
 off with the previous in
terv iew, you had finished 
telling us about your experiences at 
Cornell 
and were just beginning your graduate 
school and about to ente
r the army. So let™s start with after you left 
Corn ell
 and 
began graduate school in 
Chicago
. 
A: After I graduated from 
Corn ell
, I had been  advised by a professor who 
Leonard 
Katrow
(ph), who was very friendly towards 
me and invited me to his home ma ny 
times, he advised me not to go into acad
emia, because he said Jews didn™t have 
much of a chance. And that it would be better off to study the applications of 
sociology, so I applied to a school of
 social work at the Univ ersity of 
Chicago
, 
which at that time was well re
garded, and had a sociological
 orientation, rather than 
a psychiatric orientation. And while I 
was there, I received a phone call from 
New 
York
, from 
Edwa rd A. Newma n
, a wealthy Jewish banke
r, asking me if I were 
interested in conducting a study 
of cooperative farming in the 
United States
, what 
our experiences were in that field, because the Œ 
Henry Wallace
, either secretary of 
agriculture or vice-president at Œ I think 
he had just stopped being vice-president, 
Truman
 had been appointed Œ was very 
interested in possibly expanding 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

24
cooperative farming in the 
United States
 as a way of helping landless farm workers 
to become owners, and they were particul
arly interested in 
mo shavim, because one 
of the sons of 
Henry Wallace
 had been  in 
Israel
 for a summer, an d 
reported about 
kibbutzim and mo sh avim. So 
Edwa rd Newman
, who knew 
Henry Wallace
, 
decided to  fund a study. And the reason he
 called me is a term paper of mine on 
kibbutzim in the junior year had gotten pub
lished in a journal. 
And so, I looked like 
being an expert in an area where nobody el
se was really better informed. Not that I 
really was an expert, because I didn™t 
speak Hebrew and ha
d never lived in 
Israel
. 
So I decided to accept the job 
and after one quarter at the 
end of December, went to 
New York
 to start the job. The study wa
s Œ had to have a organizational 
sponsorship, and so we set up the rules 
[indecipherable]
 institute, and with the help 
of 
Henry Wallace
, I was able to recruit a board of
 directors, who were very, very 
prominen t. Some of them 
were su ggested by Justice 
Brandeis
, who heard about the 
study and invited me to his home on 
a Sunday mo rning to  tell him what was 
happening in the cooperative 
farming field, especially 
Palestine
. He obviously 
continued to have a significant influen
ce and interest, an d indeed, had been 
responsib le for the book by 
Walter C. Loudermilk
, the commissioner of social si Œ 
the commissioner of conservation in the de
partment of agriculture, who had made a 
study of why is it that in the 
Middle Ea st
, there is such incredib
le poverty, when  at

one time in their history, it was the most
 advanced and prospe
rous area? And he 
went by car from 
Morocco
, all the way to 
Iraq
 and 
Turkey
 and then  wrote a book 
in wh ich he pointed out that the neglect and the poverty was due to the way the 
social structure was operating under 
Islam
, and th e only bright light was the Jewish 
settlements in 
Palestine
. And he praised them and pointed out the modern  
agricultural methods and th i Œ the green line 
already existed in 1940 wh en Œ in ™41. 
And when 
Henry Wallace
 got the report, he apparently called 
Brandeis 
and to ld 
him, you should really look at this. And 
Brandeis
 got someone, a woman, to edit 
the report, publish it as a book called, ﬁ
The Land of Promise
,ﬂ and the book was 
distributed to every memb er of Congress.
 And so, the fact that I was making the 
study was obviously  of interest to 
Brandeis
. So suddenly, as a re
fugee, I felt myself 
interacting with people in 
the so Œ conservation service,
 the agricultural extension 
service, and wherever I went to study 
cooperative farming experiences in the 
United States
, I had superb  cooperation. 

Q: In this period, when you met 
Brandeis
, and you™re going around looking at the 
farms, did anybody ever question the fact
 that you were a refugee, and ask you 
about Œ 

A: No, no. Neither they, or any of the o
fficials, very high officials, I mean, you 
know, third level subcabinet
 officers, and the Œ the 
U.S.
 government, under 
Henry

Wallace
 had begun cooperative farms by purcha
sing large plantations that were 
going bankrupt, especially in the south,
 and then hiring farm managers and 
recruiting impoverished  farm laborers, put
 them on the land. Each Œ the land was 
owned co operatively by th e farm. They  didn™
t know much about how to run a farm, 
so they built a large farm and equipment 
for large machinery, and the farm manager 
began to teach the workers and gradually
 th ey took more and more responsib ility 
for running the farm. 
And so I s-studied the 27 experi
mental areas, traveling all over 
the 
United States
. 
Q: And how long 
did you stay with this job? 
A: Well, until I was drafted. In the middle of
 the study, I was drafted. I had part of a 
manuscript with me. I also visited some of
 the religious collec
tive farms, like the 
Amish and 
Amana
 colonies in 
Iowa
, which were communistic 
[indecipherable]
. 
But before I finished, I was drafted, but I 
somehow managed to finish my  report and 
Harper 
Brothers decided to publish th
e report as a book, calling it, ﬁ
Exploring 
Tomorrow™s Agriculture
.ﬂ So after, when I was in basic training at 
Fort Dix
,
 New 
Jersey 
Œ 
Q: And what year and month was that? 

A: That was 1943. I Œ I went in the army ™
42, but in basic training. I think it was ™43 
the book was published. And I was a private being trained to be a first aid enlisted

man to deal with injured pe
ople in the battlefield. When
 a package arrived, and I 
immediately knew when it wa
s brought in by the first se
rgeant that this was not 
food from some f-friend or relative. But he made me open it up, and it was a book. 
And he lo oked at this and says, he expe
cted some food and candy that could be 
distributed Œ he said, did you 
write this? I said yes. He said, well, if you can write so 
well, let™s see how well you are in cleani
ng pots. So everybody laughed and fo r one 
week I had swep Œ special duty in the kitc
hen, cleaning these very large pots, some 
of them so large that you had to
 go into th e pot to clean it. 
Q: Let me ask two questions; 
one is, do you attribute his response just to the fact 
that he was disappointed that there was 
no food, or do you th
ink any of this was 
anti-Semitic, or anti-intellectual? 
A: I don™t think so. I don™t think th ere 
was Œ I experienced no discrimination or 
reference to my refugee status. F irst of 
all, I spoke English extremely well. I did 
better on many tests, including sharpshooti
ng. I was not outstanding, but you know, 
did adequately. So the Œ w
ithin the army, I did not ex
perience any anti-foreignism, 

or anti-Semitism. 

Q: And, let me ask a different question. Wh
at name were you going by at this point, 
and can you talk about change of name? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
28
A: My brothers and I had 
changed our name in 1940. 
After the war had begun, and 
my brothers, one of them was in th
e British Army and the other in the 
Haganah 
in 
Israel
, and people in 
Israel
 anyhow wanted Œ didn™t wa
nt German names. But one 
of the special problems we faced is that our parents were living in  
Amsterda m
, and 
if we were taken prisoner, this mi ght Œ 
we were worried that this could cause 
problems for them as parents of traitors, 
because we were obviously fighting ag ainst 
the Fatherland. So  we decided to  change
 our name and ad opted a name that was 
suggested by Rabbi 
de Sola  Pool
, and Œ wh om Œ whom I 
knew, because his wife 
was president of 
Hadassah
. And I was one of the people she became interested in 
because there weren™t many young American
s who sh owed much interest and real 
knowledge about Zionism and 
Isr ael
, which I did because I had been very active in 
Germany
, even though I was only 14. So, he 
was very helpful, and he ultimately 
married 
Helen
 and me, even though we were not Se
phardim. So, at any rate, this is 
how, professionally, I finished a book wh ich 
Colu mbia
 University accepted as my 
dissertation. Because at 
Columbia
 you had to publish your dissertation, and here I 
had a book published by 
Harper
 brothers. So my disserta
tion was approved befo re 
I had taken mo re than one course in sociology at 
Colu mbia
. So when I came back 
from the army, I had to take all the cour
ses and pass examination about substance, 
but I didn™t have to write a dissertation.

Q: Okay , so now let™s go back to  
Fort Dix
, and you™re work ing th
ere, training to be 
someta Œ medic, and you
™re goin g by the name of 
Eaton
 at this point. And then 
what happens? 
A: Well, in 
Fort Dix,
 when  we finished 
our basic training, I was a sort of middle 
range effective first aid man, because not 
being very tall, I had problems carrying 
these Œ the what do you call Œ you carry hum
an beings on Œ that are injured on a Œ 
Q: Stretchers? 

A: On a what? 
Q: Stretchers, or Œ 

A: On stretcher, yeah, one stretcher. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, you had to carry
 the stretcher and Œ and on 
battlefields you had to be 

Œ keep  your head down and so
 on. So you had to carry, y
ou didn™t do it by yourself, 
two people had to carry  a stretcher. But mo st
 people preferred others to work  with 
them than me, because I wasn™t as str
ong as many other soldiers. So, instead of 

being sent to a field, to a division, I 
ended up at a military
 hospital in Camp 
Rucker,
 
Alabama
, as a clerk. And it looked like my
 future would be to be a clerk 
in a military hospital, and I was very
 well regarded , because I was among th e 
relatively few people who co
uld handle medical records,
 with all their special

words, and being able to id
entify diagnoses and to spell them properly. So  I was Œ 
my  comma nding officer thought very well 
of me. It might even resu lt in a 
promotion to  priv ate first class, but before that happened , he got a notice from 
Washin gton
 that I was being transferred. 
Q: Let me just interject one question, and 
then we™ll talk abou
t the transfer. What 
was your official citizenship status at this point? 
A: I was an enemy alien, and I was drafte
d as an enemy alien. And as an enemy 
alien, I was obviously under 
FBI 
surveillance. I know this because in 1942 I 
received a postcard from 
Sweden
, from an aunt, saying that
 they needed  money so 
that they might be able to get a visa to 
Ecuador
 for my mother. 
And they didn™t 
have money, could I raise 12,000 dollars? A
nd within tw o days or so after I got the 
postcard, the 
FBI
 came to my  door and asked me if
 I had sent any money, pointing 
out to me that this was trading with th
e enemy. Well, I didn™t have any money, I 
didn™t know anybody I coul
d get 12,000 dollars from. 
But I know, obviously my  
mail was being monitored. And,
 you know, the Œ they  did sa
y to me, it™s just as well 

you didn™t send them any money, because this
 is just a scam, as 
far as we know. But 
my  mail was being censored, w
ithout ever being notified.  
Q: So, now as an enemy alie
n, you™re in the army Œ 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
31
Q: Œ and Œ 
A: So we™re as Œ but the fact that I was 
drafte d, this didn™t see m to bother anybody. 
So it might have meant that I might have be
en promoted mo re quickly, that could be 
a factor, because I was ap Œ still a privat
e after s-several months in a really 

important position in the hospital. In other wo
rds, I was in charge 
of the night shift, 
and when people came in, they
 depended on me to keep
 the records straight, and 
that had been, apparently, a real problem, 
simply because it wasn
™t always easy to 
get the right people to do th e job. Well e
ducated people usually were assigned to 
other jobs. 

Q: And then  why did 
you leave this job? 
A: So, what happened, and I only learned that
 later, is that when you™re drafted Œ in 
World War II, the army had adopted the 
IBM 
technology to keep personnel records, 
so that every soldier, when 
he was drafted, had Œ was in
terviewed in great detail 
about their background, and all of that was put on 
IBM
 cards. And in 1942, or was 
it f Œ or early ™43, I™m not sure exactly, the 
U.S. 
government had decided that when  
we liberate 
France
, the 
U.S.
 would need  to govern  
France
. 
Roosevelt 
did not trust 
de Gaulle
, whom he regarded as an extrem
e nationalist who would undermine the 
recovery of 
Europe
, as happened in wo r Œ after 
World War I, when the French 
were Œ insisted on the 
Versailles
 treaty. So, he decided he wasn™t going to let the 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

32
free French govern 
France
, but there would be a 
U.S.
 military government of 
France
, then there would be free election, an
d let the French de
cide whether they 
want 
de Gaulle
 or somebody else. So in pr
eparation for the liberation of 
France
, 
they were going to train a cadre of people to govern  
France
. And even though I 
didn™t know French, but becu
 Œ my card fell out and they
 decided I was one of these 
people, so suddenly I 
was transferred from Camp
 Rucker, Alabama
 to 
Queens 
Co lleg e, New Yo rk
, to learn how to be one of th e military governmen
t staff. French 
economics, French history, French law. Th
e f Œ the Œ th e taxation system and so on, 
so for six months I learned a great deal about 
France
, and learned enough French so 
I could go to 
Co lumbia
 and pass my  French language ex am, because at 
Columbia
 
you had to have two forei
gn languages if you wanted a 
PhD
. They accepted my 
German and I passed the French  exam, I le
arned en ough. And we were about ready 
to be shipped over to 
England
 to work with the Eng
lish, who had reluctantly 
accepted the policy of 
Roosevelt
, when 
Roosevelt 
and 
Churchill
 met in 
Casa blanca
. And th ere 
Churchill 
convinced 
Roosevelt
 that the free French, 
de 
Gaulle
 should govern the occupied 
France
, that with all the problems that 
de 
Gaulle
 might create, it was better than the 
English and Americans tr Œ doing the 
job. So  overnight, about 10,000 bright Am
erican soldiers became surplu s, and had 
to be reassigned, and our Œ overn ight, ou
r program was finished
. I mean, you know, 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

when you come to think of it, right in th
e middle of it, there was no longer any need 
to train people to govern Fr
ench towns and villages. And 
most of the trainees were 
reassigned to different divisions. Many milit
ary units had a shortage of people with 
high 
IQs
. And this was an opportunity for the ar
my to infuse more 
people with high 
IQs
. But a few were given a choice, because the army was trying to fill some 
special jobs. And one of them was a unit th
at would be dropped 
to sabotage German 
facilities, d ropped over 
Germany
. And so I was interviewed and told that that was 
an opportunity for me, but th
ey warned me that the chan
ces of surviving were less 
than 50 percent, and wh at would be involve
d. And not that I was particularly heroic 
and wanting such a Œ a job, but I didn™t feel
 as a Jew I could say no, so I Œ I said 
yes, when  I really wa Œ wished I didn™t have 
to say yes. So, as a result, I was sen t to 
Camp 
Ritchie
, the 
U.S.
 intelligence training area near 
Washin gton, D.C.
 
Q: Can you tell me about the type
 of training you got at Camp  
Ritchie
, and who the 
other soldiers were who you met there? 
A: Well, shortly after I arrived at Camp 
Ritchie
 it became clear the govern Œ the 
army  had decided that the program of 
dropping people didn™t wo rk, the Germans 
were too well organized. So  actually I found  myself attached to
 another unit, the 
psychological warfare division of the 
U.S. Army
. 
Q: Now Œ

A: Œ and that psychological warfare divisi
on had very interesti
ng responsibilities of 
providing intelligence at the division, as we
ll as at the su preme headquarter level. 
Q: I want to talk in detail about wh at you did in 
PSYOPS
, but can you first tell me 
about who th e other people were in  your Œ 
in the division and in
 your unit? What 
types of people were recruited for this work? 
A: In the psychological warfare divisi
on, the key person wa
s a Austrian named 
Captain 
Han s Ha rb er
(ph), and he had become importa
nt because he Œ he married 
the daughter of Œ the father of 
Ted Kennedy
 and the other 
Kennedys
, who had 
been ambassador to 
Great Britain
. The way 
Hans Harb er
(ph), who was himself a 
refugee from 
Austria
 Œ he became extremely  well-kn
own because of his personal 
history. 
Harb ie
(ph)
 
was the son of a Hungarian Jew named 
Ba eckes h ee
(ph), who 
edited the scandal sheet of 
Budapest
, and who had shot himself in the foot in World 
War I, so he wouldn™t have to serve. And 
Hans
 had been very  ashamed of his father 
when the war broke out in Œ World War II, 
in ™39, he signed up in the Foreign 
Legion an d was taken prisoner by the Ge
rmans and escaped, and wrote a book 
about the whole situation; his service, his 
family, and it became a best seller. So this 
is how, because of the book, he was inv
ited to lecture all over the country and 
Euro pe
, and this is how he met his future wife. And th en he signed up in  the 
American army , and he dising 
Œ distinguished  himself in 
North Africa
. He was a

journalist who had studi
ed  the history of 
Hitler
 and his family. So he was appointed 
to head th e psychological warfare units, and 
was regarded by top level executiv es as 
a intelligent, sophisticated anal
yst of what was going on in 
Euro pe
.  
Q: Now, before you co
uld b Œ en ter psy Œ th e 
PSYOPS 
division, did you have to 
undergo any security clearan
ces, any other special exams? 
A: If I did, they h-had all the information 
about me, so I Œ I would Œ I do not recall. 
My hunch is they did make
 the security clearance. 
Q: And what sort of special trai
ning did th ey give you at Camp  
Ritchie
? 
A: Well, the training we got was a a-an
alysis of how the German army  was 
structured; tactically, strategically, chai
ns of command. We studied the German 
propaganda techniques. We studied 
the British American policies that 
Harber
(ph) 
had worked out with the Britis
h, which contrasted to the 
Hollywo od
 approach, that 
at the beginning had been kind of adopted, 
a kind of ad vertising that we have now, 
in which you oftentime make claims that 
are not Œ that are mi
sleading. The British 
had decided befo re 
Dunkirk
, that the only way they  could win in 
Europe 
is to 
adopt a policy of always telling the truth. So at 
Dunkirk
 they reported their defeat, 
the problems of evacuating ev erybody, th e 
losses, and they broadcast these facts to 
the Germans over 
BBC
, and the French and so on. And you know what, they were 
facing a tremendous loss, had the German
s had succeeded, and co ntinued th is

36
policy and psychological warfare had ad opte
d the policy of not using propaganda, 
they Œ you know, the wa
y Americans advertise. 
Q: And how did they define
 your mission? Did you ha
ve a mission statement? 
A: The mission statement was to get the German
s as Œ first of all, to believe in what 
they were being told by the 
U.S.
 and by the British, and s
econd, to get the Germans 
to question their regime, on the basis of wh
at was difficult for the Germans. In other 
word s, we™d Œ we Œ to simp
ly say the Germans were unfair and unjust and so on, 
wasn™t going to work, 
because they felt that 
Germany
, in order to survive, had to 
do so me terrible things, that™s war. We ha
d to focus on inconsistencies in German 
policies from the point of view of the 
German public and the differentiation 
between wh at was good fo r the general pub
lic, and wh at was good to the me Œ for 
the maintenance of the regime. 
Q: And did you begi
n any of the actual work 
while you were still in the 
United 
States
 Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ or was this all pre Œ 

A: We Œ we wrote leaflets to be dropped. 
Q: While you were in Camp 
Ritchie
? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
37
A: While we da Œ we had to find ou
r way blind, men left all by ourselves 
somewhere in Œ in the area. We had to write
 reports to headquar
ters. It turned out 
later on, the unit I was attached 
to was directly attached to 
Eisenhower™s 
supreme 
headquarters, so we were reporting directly. 
Ha-Ha
-
Harber
(ph) obviously  was 
given that job, and so th e 10 people he ha
d selected automatically got jobs that had 
actually impact on public policy. 

Q: And when did your unit ship out to 
Europe
? 
A: We shipped out in ™
43, and were sent to 
London
, there to work 
with the British 
and get trained for British Am
erican cooperation. We had 
Œ that time we had not yet 
attacked 
Europe 
at 
Omaha Beach
, but we were being readied for that event. We 
knew that sooner or later we would invade 
Europe
, but of course we didn™t know 
when  it would happen. But that was our tr
aining. And especially writing reports, 
working with British Œ actually, we were 
being investigated carefully by British 
intelligence. They didn™t trust Œ and I l
earned later that th e Americans, our 
particular unit was sent to a villa in the outskirts of 
Lo ndo n
, wh ich was very 
comfortable, but of course the blitz wa
s going on. Any time you got hit by a bomb, 
that was it, a whole block 
would be wiped out
 by one bomb. And Œ but the villas 
were run by women Œ British women soldie
rs, who did Œ who fe
d us, who looked 
after our clothes, who woke us up in the mo
rning, who made sure that we had, you 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

38
know, were properly fed and had all the comf
orts. What we didn™t realize, that they 
also were carefully making notes on all of
 us, and had conversa
tions. Their job was 
to make sure that we would be able to f
unction in a proper fashion. And then , about 
five weeks after the invasion of 
France
, we landed at 
Omaha Beach
 at a time when 
it was no longer dangerous, because actua
lly, American troops had liberated 
Paris
. 
So we landed and there was a bus 
waiting, and we drove directly to 
Paris
. 
Q: Now, won™t you tell me about what your 
day to day work  was? And I know that 
you were writing leaflets, but what was th
e source of informati
on, how did you get 
the information that you we Œ based on 
your reports, and how di
d you decide wh at 
went into  the reports that you were writing? 
A: Well, the leaflets had to appeal to Germ
ans. So what we did is we looked  at the 
tactical situ ation, and then presented it to
 the Germans as this is what is happening 
in the battlefields. And giving th em facts 
about what was going on, which by 1940 
Œ late 1943 - 1944 was no lo ng
er entirely favorable to the Germans. I mean, we 

were still incurring losses, but we 
were beginning 
Œ you know, in 
Africa
 we 
actually were able to defeat 
Rommel
 and prevent the capture of 
Eg ypt
. So, 
depending on what happened th at
 day, we would write a le
aflet, and then we would 
think of some other things that might ma
ke Germans question the policies of their 
government. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

39
Q: And how independent we
re you in terms of wh at you put in? Who had to  
approve these leaflets? 
A: The 10 men work ing in  teams of one or
 two or thr Œ not mo re than that, would 
prepare a leaflet, or a news broadcast, 
and they would be reviewed by Captain
 
Harber
(p h). And he had the authority to say ye
s or no. There was a colonel, but the 
colonel was somebody who had come from 
the broadcasting industry, who worked 
well with 
Harber
(ph), but really 
Harber
(ph) was the authority, as somebody who 
understood what was going on in 
Euro pe
. 
Q: And how did you disse
minate these leaflets once you wrote them? 
A: Well, we did nothing, they were just Œ 
they were just exerci
ses. The Œ I think at 
times Œ no, I don™t think, I know at times 
our products were shown to high officials, 
probably  
Patton
 and 
Bradley
 and 
Eisenhower
, to give them an idea what 
psychological w-warfare we™d be 
doing. But it was all practice. 
Q: So none of these ever made it to 
Germany
, or Œ 
A: I don™t know. They Œ they
 may very well have been 
dropped. Certainly I knew 
that once we were at Radio 
Luxembourg
, everything we did 
was being dropped. I 
don™t know whether, before 
we actually occupied 
Luxembourg
, and Radio 
Luxembourg
, and operated from there, whether 
the British had decided that simply 
it was enough to  have the 
BBC
, simply because to drop 
leaflets meant to use air

40
power, and every plan e we could spare was be
ing used to bomb. So
 I sort of doubt 
that they would drop leaflets, when we 
had no capacity to occupy, to get Germans 
to surrender, and so on. So I™m not sure th
at Œ there may have been some tactical 
use used in the radio brod Œ 
broadcast, but Œ but we didn™
t get that kind of feedback. 
But I doubt very mu ch that we dropped any 
leaflets before we were in a capacity to 
take prisoners. 

Q: So when did 
your unit shift from 
Paris 
to 
Luxembourg
, and what was the 
reason for the shift? 

A: Let™s se e, 
D-Day
 was?  
Q: June seventh. June fourth . 
A: June fourth, so in July, when we went to 
Paris
, and then about a week later, we 
were shipped to 
Luxembourg
, wh ich the Germans had evacuated in  a hurry. And 
they left Radio 
Lux embourg
 operating. And so we to
ok ov Œ the allies took over 
Radio 
Luxembourg
 and tu rned  it into a broadcasting station to 
Germany
, and to 
Euro pe
, to 
France
, and to many other languages. So
, basically we were stationed 
in the radio station, which had large administrative headquarters
, and also military 
bar-barracks of the 
Luxembourg
 Army , and the population of 
Luxembourg  
was 
very friendly. After all, they Œ they we
re not Œ had been oc
cupied. So, it was a 
pretty secure place from which to operate. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
41
Q: And were your radio stations just 
conveying tactical 
information from the 
battlefield, or were you doing anything else? 
A: We had news programs every hour 
on the hour in German. And Radio 
Luxembourg
 also had a program that cl
aime d to be a Œ a group of 
SS
 dissidents 
who had decided that the fuehrer needed  
protection from the co
rrupt subordinates, 
like 
Goering 
and 
Goebbels
 and 
Himmler
, who were really taking advantage of 
him, and sabotag ing his policies, and th at
 there was a need to clean out these 
traitors, to enable th
e fuehrer to retake command, to 
protect the Fatherland. And that 
was the approach of the dissident 
SS
 group that a program claimed to be, even  
though it was broadcast over Radio
 Luxembourg
 only five minutes a day. 
Q: And who was taking the role of the 
SS [indecipherable]
 
A: I don™t know, because they never told us
 that this program existed. It was so 
secret that even we didn™t 
[phone ringing]
 Okay ? The Œ this program, which we 
called the black propaganda, because it was 
based on a falsehood. And that unit, I 
learned later, broadcast gossip that we pick
ed  up from prisoners of war, because we 
were instructed, when inte
rviewing prisoners of war 
to find out about their home 
life, what was going on in the cities where 
they lived, you know
, the soldiers who 
were being taken prisoners were wonderi
ng wer Œ will they be 
tortured. And when 
we interviewed prisoner of war, we firs
t sat them down and says, would you like

42
some coffee? And we gave them real co
ffee, and spoke about the fact, you know, 
Americans still can buy good coffee. 
Q: Did any of them questi
on why your German was so good, or susp ect that Œ 
A: The Germans? 
Q: Yeah, the prisoners of war, or did any 
of them suspect why your German was so 
good? 

A: No, th  Œ I Œ not a single prisoner ever
 asked me where Œ how come I spoke such 
good German, was I Jewish? They were too 
scared. They may have
 suspected that I 
was Jewish, and some prisoners, of course, 
without being asked, told me about how 
opposed they were to the persecution of Jews.  
Q: Now, you say there was another unit th
at was doing th e black propaganda. What 
Œ was your propaganda all white and red? 
A: In other words, part of the informa
tion we were asked to provide was for a 
service that we didn™t know
 about, because it was so secr
et, that it w asn™t shared 
with us. I think
 Harber
(ph) knew  about the black program, but he never shared it 
with us. 

Q: Now, did you ever get any reports back
 ab out who was actually listening to your 
radio broadcast, and what effect it had? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
43
A: We asked people, and Œ be
cause severe jail sentences; being sent to the front 
lines, if you weren™t in  the front lines; be
ing sent to concentration camp  was a 
possible punishment for listening. It was st
rictly forbidden to listen to any enemy 
broadcast. And so it was important for us 
to find out if they had heard, and we 
found out that a large proportion Œ I don™t 
rememb er statistics Œ were Œ had listened 
at some times, because th
ey wanted to know what wa
s going on. And the other 
thing we did do, is to encourage listene
rship. We not only provided accurate 
information to the Germans, 
of exactly what was happeni
ng, we provided them with 
information of what was happening to bombed cities and v
illages, to the extent that 

we could get information. And about th
ree months before Christma s, 1944, 
Harbie
(ph) convened  a meeting of his 10 sold
iers and said, you know, we have a 
problem what to do on Ch
ristma s. Should we broad
cast on bri Œ Ch ristmas we do 
every day? Because after all, our broadcas
ts are very disturbing to the Germans. 
The news every day is not g
ood. And what should we do
 on Œ on Ch ristmas day? 
How to somehow appeal to them? And I pro
posed  that we don™t broadcast any news 
on th at day, since it would be bad, but in
stead interview prisoners of war to send 
greetings to their loved ones, and broadc
ast them. So the decision was we should 
announce from months in advance, on Chri
stmas day, we will have 1,000 German 
prisoners of war personally speak to their 
families. W-We learned later that this 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

44
news spread and was a way of making pe
ople think about agwa Œ if they had a 
prisoner of war, maybe my  son is among th e 1,000. 
Q: What sort of greetings did th ey say? 
A: We would ask them to Œ they had ab
out a little less th an a minute. They could 
say who they are, that they™re a prisoner of
 war and so and so , and they™re in this 
and this camp, that they are feeling well,
 that they™re healthy, sending greeting to 
mother and father 
[indecipherable]
 and brothers and sisters, and whatever they  
wanted to  say and do through th at period.
 Many of them talked
 about that they™re 
getting good food and that they™re
 not being to rtured an d th Œ 
Q: And where were these 
POW 
camps? Were they all in 
Luxembourg
, or 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, we would go to the front lines a
nd then simp ly Œ our unit had trucks, these 
news Œ not Œ l-like any radio 
Œ any radio station, or tele
vision station, they have a 
truck fully equipped to interview and to  
broadcast, so that 
we would actually 
interview people, and get them in at broadc
ast, or sometimes have them repeat it so 
that it would fit our pattern, and gradua
lly accu mu lated enough personnel using 
these mobile broadcasting ca Œ trucks. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

45
Q: Been talking about the radio, I want
 to talk about the print aspect. You 
mentioned in 
Paris
 that you thought that nothi
ng was dropped because of the 
bombing, but later on it was. 
A: And it wa Œ na Œ 
Q: So tell us about the leaflets
 and how those were sent over 
Germany
. 
A: Not only leaflets, we also
 had a newspaper, called ﬁ
The Front Post
,ﬂ and they 
would also be droppe
d. They were a little larg er, ha
d more information and were 
overstated. And they  were dropped. I don™
t think they  may Œ probably  every tw o or 
three days Œ 

Q: This is all by airplane? 
A: By airplane, or by artillery shells. 
Q: And where were they ta
rgeted, for cities, or Œ 
A: They were targeted on front line unitsof the German army. Occasionally I think 

we also dropped leaflets, ﬁ
The Front Post
,ﬂ not the surrender bre Œ leaflets. They 
were only dropped over the German lines.But we also would drop newspapers over 

German villages and cities. 

Q: And were you able to gauge th e eff
ectiveness of these leaflets? Do you know 
whether people read them or saved them? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
46
A: Well, we would interview people and we
 certainly would get feedbacks that they 
were being read, but I had no access to th
e comp rehensive reports, so I Œ I don™t 
really know whether we reached 25 percent or
 40 percent or 50 percent at different 
times. But certainly the Germ
ans were not effective to 
completely stop the use of 
the material that was being dropped. 
Q: And tell me about the content. I 
Œ you mentioned before that it was Œ 
A: Well, I Œ 
Q: Œ largely tactical. Did you talk ab
out any atrocities in these leaflets? 
A: The British opposed the idea of focusi
ng on the persecution of the Jews. They 
took the position that Œ a-and a correct position Œ 
Hitler 
was again and ag ain 
reminding Germans that there wouldn™t be
 a war, except for the Jews. And of 
course, 
Roosevelt
 was Œ was Œ had his name changed from 
Rosenfeld
(ph) to  
Roosevelt
 and that if it weren™t for th e Jews, nobody would oppose 
Hitler
. And the 
British took the position that
 focusing on the atrocitie
s would only reinforce the 
idea that this is what the war was all about
. So you had to get special permission to 
make any reference to the persecution 
of th e Jews on our news broadcasts. 
Q: So were there any times when you looked
 for that special pe
rmission, any events 
that were covered? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
47
A: Well, I think there was evi Œ there was Œ I think 
Auschwitz
 was mentioned, but 
not every day, not even every week. 
Q: So let me ask about 
Auschwitz
. 
A: I mean, when we started to liber
ate camps, then th
at was announced. 
Q: So what Œ 

A: But that was very late. But in ™44,
 you couldn™t touch the Jewish issue. 
Q: So we mentioned the liberation of 
Auschwitz
, so were you getting info rmation 
from the Soviets? Were they shar
ing inf Œ intelligence with you? 
A: Oh yes. No, no, the exch
ange of information with th
e Soviets on that issue, I 
think was pretty good. Certainly our leafle
ts constantly  showed
 the Russian front, 
which looked mu ch Œ their advances were 
mu ch quicker than our ad vances, so we 
had to focus on, soon you will 
be occupied by the Russians.
 But we didn™t say, put 
it this way, we simply said the Russians 
are advancing, andwe
 are advancing, but 
we didn™t. We showed on the map that th
ey were advancing mu ch  mo re quickly. 
Q: Now I understand there was also inform
ation about surrender in these leaflets. 

Can you tell Œ 

A: About what? 
Q: Surrender. 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
48
Q: Can you talk about that? 
A: Well, we took th e position, say to the Germans, you™ve lost the war. If you 

surrender, you will be Œ this leaflet will Œ a
nd this was on every leaflet, is a w ritten 
guarantee of the condi Œ 
[coughing] 
of the following conditions of surrender: first, 
you will not be tortured. You will be sent 
in a prison camp. You will get three meals 
a day, identical to the food of the American or British soldiers, which includes; real 

coffee three times a d ay; real cigarettes 
with every meal; meat and fish. Healthy 
food, the way allied soldiers are being fe
d. You will be allo
wed through the Red 
Cross to communicate with you
r families, so that if 
you surrender, you will have 
contact with your families, which now, 
very  often you don™t have, because the 
German communication sy stem was not very
 good in  ™44 and ™45. That was the 
surrender. And these guarantee
, they called it guarantee 
[indecipherable]
. Quite a 
few soldiers, when they surre
ndered, pulled them out of their shoes, or somewhere 
in their clothing, to be sure
 that they would be treated properly. And certainly when  
we interviewed prisoners of 
war, we did not use the kind 
of threats or you know, s Œ 
intimidation f-for I think many good reasons.First of all, tactical information you 

don™t get from soldiers. You can sometimes
 get it from officers, but by th e time you 
get it, all a Œ it often is no longer valuab
le. Because what do we want to know is 
where do you have your ar
tillery, what kind of weapons 
do you have, does your unit 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
49
have? What plans were made to proceed 
to defeat us, and so on. That kind of 
tactical information, for 24 
- 20 - 48 hours might be useful
, but with advances of the 
battlefield, it does Œ it doesn ™t become very
 meaningful. So at
 any rate, while Œ 
when  you interviewed officers, you would 
try to learn from them what kind of 
equipment they had. You didn™t just f Œ 
you didn™t focu s on th at, you also spent a 
lot of time on th eir schooling, how they beca
me officers, what their career was, and 
were they being treated fairly. What about 
their families, how they  were doing, their 
children and so on. And f Œ on that basis,
 people often told us things, how life was 
terrible, what they were fearful of being 
arrested simply becau
se they wanted to 
survive, and that they had b
een dis Œ badly treated, and th
at in particular officer in 
their comm and had been very mean and they
 had suffered this and th at and so  on. 
So that kind of info rmation 
[indecipherable]
 obviously, did reach the black station, 
but we didn™t know it. 

Q: Did they talk much abou
t their views toward the Nazi party? Did any of them 
have Nazi memb ership that they deni
ed, or was this si
mp ly not covered? 
A: Some did, very few. Most of the peop
le tried to avoid politically sensitive things, 
but they weren™t sophisticate always to 
know what was sensitive. So we did get 
useful information, but we were very ci
rcumspect of asking th em. We Œ we did ask 
them, were you a member of the Nazi party,
 and mo st of them were. And then  they 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
50
would say, well, understand, 
everybody had to  be a member
 of the Nazi party. And 
then we would learn a little bit ab out thei
r career. Some of them were willing to 
talk, because they thought it might impr
ove the way would Œ 
the way would be 
treated, because they were being treated so well. And if they were resistant, we 

withdraw and then send them back, and le
t them tell their fe
llow soldiers in the 
prison camp, I didn™t give them any info rmat
ion, but they  didn™t do anything to me. 
And thereby enhance our reputation among 
the prisoners of war, because we would 
not only interview them Œ we couldn™
t interview everybody who was being 
captured, there were too ma
ny people being captured. 
Q: Now, I understand that you actually
 took in  one surrender of a general Œ  
A: 
Von Poten
, 
Ernst von Poten
. 
Q: Tell us about that incident. 

A: Well, we were always looking for inte
resting prisoners, so when the city of 
Treya
(ph) was about to fall, I was sent, as I 
o ften was, to go there and find out how 
mili Œ to write a report on the Œ how a milita
ry government functioned after the first 
de Œ day or two. And see if there were a
ny interesting prisoners. So when I got to 

Treya
(ph), the captain who Œ in charge of 
military government, been maybe there 
24 hours and 48 hours, a
nd had found a German w
ho was willing to be a 
coordinator between the military govern
ment and the German administrative

51
system. And he had apparently not been a 
Nazi, so the captain had developed trust. 
And when I ask about interesting prisoners, 
he said, well ba Œ yo
u better talk to Œ I 
have the name now, but I don™t rememb er just now wh at the name is. So I came  to 
his office and he said, oh yes, there™s 
a general who would like to surrender, but 
he™s afraid of being take
n prisoner by some enlisted gr
oup, because they might 
mistreat him. He would like to be Œ he™s hi
ding, hoping to get arrested by officers, 
and I know where he is and he told  me that
™s what he would lik
e to do, and if you 
are interested, I will tell youwhere he is. That was kind 
of a silly, you know Œ but I 
got the in structions and so on, and talked
 more. He didn™t know much about the 
general himself. My driver, who was married, 
felt this was a trick 
to get us into the 
woods above 
Treya
(ph) where there might still be Ge
rman soldiers that had been 
roaming around and would attack us, and th
is is not a reliable story. But I had 
become convinced that it was real, at least 
th ere™s a good chance, and so  I said, let™s 
go and get him and he 
had Œ my  driver had no choice,
 I Œ I happen ed to b-be one 
grade above him. So, we went with our 
regular broadcasting 
truck, and followed 
directions and drove up into th e woods a
nd after about maybe half an hour, I saw a 
man walking with a Œ a dog and 
von Poten
 had been  described to me of having a 
dog. And so we stopped.

A: This time I™m taking 
[break] 
Q: Okay, this begins the next track with the interview with 
Joseph Eaton
. 
A: Well, a man who looked like 
the general that was describe
d, and the fact that he 
was walking with a dog, we stopped the 
truck. And I opened the window and said, 
General 
von Poten
? He looked up and said, 
jawohl
? Sort of, yes. And I said, I 
understand you want to surrende
r? He said yes. I said, well, I was sen t by supreme 
headquarters to take your surrender. Thank 
you, he said, I™m glad how Œ that you 
got the message. And here is, about 200 mete
rs from here is a cottage in wh ich we 
have been living since I wa
s fired from my post a month 
ago, or two months ago. 
So please, let™s sit down comfortably in my
 house. So  he walked and we drove and 
he went in to the house and brought out 
his wife and introduced her. And so my 
driver was suspicious, he didn™t go in, an
d I went into  the house and we sat down. 
But the small room was crowded with furn
iture covered with bed sheets. And we 
sat down on a couch and started to talk. He pulled out documents signed by the 

chief Œ the commander of th
e German army, General 
Keitel
, informing him that the 
fuehrer had decided that the army  need
ed more young people; they  weren™t 
sufficiently aggressive to pu
sh ahead, and fo r that reason, in spite of his good 
service, he was being retired. He appealed 
the forced retirement, but the appeal was 
denied. All of this was in correspondence 
signed by no one less 
than the counterpart

of 
Eisenhower, 
the chief commander of the Ge
rman army. So, I took those 
documents and he said he decided, even 
though he was no lo nger a soldier, he said, 
I™m a civilian now, but he decided that as 
a former general, he might be considered 
someone to be made a prisoner of war, he ho
ped this would not be the case, but this 
is why he let the message be transmitted th
at he was ready to  be in touch with the 
enemy. He indicated in conversations a
bout the war, I learned Œ he and I talked 
about his career. So, he said, I became a so
ldier before World War I, and served in 
the Austrian army, and he told me the di
fferent battles. And th
en stayed in the 
Austrian army and then when 
Germany
 occupied  
Austria
, he became part of the 
German army. And he was in
volved in the war against 
Russia
 and was in-injured 
near 
Stalingrad
, and for a year and a half was in the hospital. And after he had 
recuperated, the army  assigned him to be
 the governor of the French city of 
Metz
. 
And he showed me documents there, his a
ppointment. And he indicated that he had 
problems with the head of the Nazi party in 
Metz
. 
Metz 
is a French city, occupied 
mo stly by German speaking 
people, so it™s part of 
Alsace-Lorraine
 that had been 
transferred after World War I, to 
France
. An d he said, I had problems with the local 
Nazi leader. When I got the 
job, they offered me severa
l villas, but they were all 
taken from Jews. And my wife and I didn™t 
want to live in a house that was full of 
tears, so we didn™t take them, we went into
 an apartment. He may have realized that 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

54
I was Jewish, but he didn™t ask me. And then
 I was in Œ had trouble with the Nazi 
party leader, because I took 
the position that for security
 purposes, we had to choo Œ 
treat the local population well. So I went 
to French music even
ts, French theater, 
not only the German theater, a
nd the Nazi leader felt that 
was not a proper thing to  
do, fo r the commanding general to go to 
a French theater production. And he 
complained to 
Himmler
 and asked that he be dismisse
d, and apparently succeeded; 
Himmler
 supported his retiremen t. All of this 
was in documents. So, I se Œ I then 
ask him, well, what you Œ wh
at would you recommend that 
Germany
 do today? He 
said, we™ve lost the war, we have to 
accept unconditional surrender, because every 
day major German villages and cities ar
e devastated, and we are not gaining 
anything. It™s Œ we™ve lost. So I said, woul
d you be willing to tell this to the German 
population if you had a chance? He says, of 
course. And then I told  him that he was 
a lucky man, that he had the opportunity to
 do this right now, because there was a 
broadcasting station in my  tr
uck. So  he got caught, and 
I gave him a pen and paper, 
and I found he had great difficulty writing a sc
ript, so I offered to write it, help him 
draft it. Well, what are you going to  say?
 He said okay, and I drafted a speech, 
thinking in terms of what is he likely to 
say? So, you know, he 
wasn™t advocating to 
surrender, because 
Germany
 had done terrible things. He
 Œ he had no regrets about 
moving into  
Russia
 and whatev er he-helped in 
Russia
, and you know, every

command was one that he tried to execute
. He simply was willing to surrender 
because it was better for 
Germany
. So he modified my re
marks, his German was 
much better than mine. And th
en I said let™s Œ I sat him 
into the truck doing exactly 
what you are doing, and we listened to the 
broadcast. And then I had him do it two 
more times, because it didn™t
 sound as good as I thou
ght it wou Œ should be. And 
afterwards I told him that he should put 
on his uniform, and asked him if he had any 
weapons, and th e only thing he had was a sword and a pistol, and I took both of 
those. And he dressed in his army  unifo rm 
and I said, well, I have to take you to 
headquarters to Œ for them to decide whet
her you are to become a prisoner of war, 
or a civilian and could be treated as a civ
ilian. And so he gave me more papers to 
document his status. And put him into a truck la
te at night, the front seat, I sat in the 
back because again, I didn™t trust him 
to sit in back of me, and drove to 
Luxembourg
. We got there about four o™cloc
k in the morning and I called my 
commanding officer in his quarters and told  him that I got a general. And 
Harber
(p h), who had a good se
nse of humor says, 
Eaton
, why don™t you drive 
more carefully? And after telling him a little 
bit more about the general, I said, well, 
why don™t we h-have breakfast with him, 
because I think everybody else here would 
like to meet him. The Americans had not
 captured a general up to now on th e 
western front like the Russians side. And th
ere was a Œ well, you n Œ as you know,

in 
Stalingrad
 a Russian general who actually then
 organized troops to fight with 
the Russians against 
Hitler
. So, at about five o™clock,
 we Œ the cook had prepared  
good breakfast, bacon and eggs and tri
mmings, and the colonel and majors and 
captains were all assembled. There was one th
ing that I forgot to tell you, I had been 
told that the general was terribly worri
ed about being take
n prisoner by enlisted 
men, he thought he would be mistreated
. So I decided I would make my self an 
officer. That was a risk y thin
g to do, to impersonate an 
officer in the army. But you 
know, we had a great deal of freedom in 
my  cir Œ in other word s, there was nobody 
telling me what to do when I 
went to the front lines. It 
was my  decision to decide 
where, which camp to go to, whom to interv
iew, which American 
officers to ask for 
cooperation. So, before going 
up in the hills, early in th e morning, about eight or 
8:30, I asked Germans where there was a dr
ugstore, and I went to the drugstore, 
which wasn™t open yet, rang the bell. The 
druggist answered wh en  he saw, I guess, 
the military  truck outside and looked worri
ed, of course. And I said, I need a Band-
Aid. Well, that was an easy request. So 
he immediately got a box of Band-Aid s. 
And ask him for a scissors and I cut two pi
eces of the rubberized part of the Band-
Aid, which is white on the ot
her side, and put it on the helmet and promoted myself 
to captain. And so, when I took the genera
l into, you know, cust
ody, I introduced 
myself as C aptain 
Ea ton
, who had been sent by suprem
e headquarters to accept his

57
surrender. So, you know, he fe
lt sort of pleased that so
mehow supreme headquarters 
Œ and that may have had a fact Œ an impa
ct on his re-readiness to cooperate. So I 
had told  
Ha rb ie
(ph) on the phone what I had do
ne. And when  I arrived ev erybody 
treated me as Captain 
Eaton
, and Œ and my driver was sort of amazed that I Œ 
nobody criticized me, and th
en afterwards a decision was made to clear with 
supreme headquarters what to
 do with the general, that 
we would use him to work 
for us at Radio 
Lux embourg
, and in the Œ the day or two that this might take, we 
put up th e general in the hotel, and my  job, 
I was in the same room with him, was to 
take him for walks, see to it that he got
 his rations, and talk to him. And then  
introduce him, bring him to different o
fficers who wanted to talk to him, for 
whatever information they we
re interested in. And after 
da Œ a day or two, nothing 
happened. So I was able
 to talk to Captain 
Ha rber
(ph), he said well, we are having 
problems with this man, and I don™t know
 what™s going to happen, but it doesn™t 
look good, because some of
 the senior officials in 
Eisenhower™s 
headquarters are 
concerned over the fact that you took th
is general in Third Army territory and 
brought him to 
Luxembourg
, wh en according to  army  rules, which you didn™t 
know and I didn™t know, you f Œ all prisoners
 of war have to be cleared through the 
prison camps. And you didn™t clear him th
rough the prison camp , you to ok him 
directly to headquarters. And some peop
le are talking about court-martialing not

only you, but me and the colonel. So, it to
ok tw o weeks before a decision was made 
not to court-martial us. 
Q: What happened to  the broadcast? 
A: Noth ing, it wasn™t used. Apparently
, there was enough fear among th e upper 
level staff that 
Patton
 would get furious if someone th
at was captured in his area 
was not Œ did not Œ he did not
 have the opportun
ity to handle the whole situation. 
And for that reason, rather than ge
t into another controversy between 
Patton 
an d 
Bradley
 and 
Eisenhower
 Œ and there had been many co
ntroversies between them, I 
mean, they Œ 
Patton
 was very egocentric Œ the decision was made to return the 
captain to where we had ta
ken him prisoner and then  to
 notify the French, the free 
French, who had been  asked to move into  
Treya
(ph) as the Third Army  was 
advancing, to come up and arrest him. So 
my  job, they  says Œ an-an Œ and Œ an d Œ 
and they said, we decided 
you should do the job. So here was my Œ I-I was given 
another driv er, and it was my  job to find 
the place where I had taken him prisoner. 
Q: I want to shift the focus now. We™ve 
been  talking about your role as an 
American soldier and I want to talk about 
your attitudes as a Jewish soldier, and the 
war at this point is winding down. I unders
tand that you to ok advantage of the fact 
that you had use of a car to actually ex
plore and see wh at happened  to your own 
family. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
59
A: Yeah, well, shortly before being sent 
overseas, apparently army  policy was to 
naturalize enemy aliens, espe
cially people like my self, w
ho had a very high security 
position. So I was given a three day leave to travel to 
Chicago
 to go before a judge 
who Œ I don™t think he ever tested me
 as normally citizenship  people ar Œ 
application for citizenship, with  being in
 th e army , it Œ the whole thing was about 
five minutes. And th e Œ so I had become a citizen. The Œ and I was a citizen in 

England
 and Œ wh en serving over i-in 
Germany
. The Œ obviously w-we all knew 
what was Œ that the Germans 
were murdering Jews in la
rge numbers. Exactly what 
was happening, we didn™t 
know. You heard rumo rs of 
Auschwitz
, you heard Œ you 
knew that in concentration camps many people were tortured, and some people 
were killed. But you didn™t kn
ow any of the full details at
 all. And in my unit of 10 
people, I think there were two who were 
not Jewish, all the others were. And we 
didn™t talk about being Jewish. There 
were German refugees like myself and 
Captain 
Harber
(ph), we knew had been
 born into a Jewish 
family, but we didn™t 
know what his sympathies were, that he
 had been converted. And none of my  
fellow soldiers and I ever talked about 
the Jewish problem. They didn™t seem to 
ever talk about it. And so, it Œ it™s someth
ing you kept to your
self, but I was very 
much aware, not only of wh
at was Œ we knew was happening to Jews, that they had 
been murdered in 
large numbers in 
Russia
, that Œ that we had heard. But I also 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

60
knew that Œ what was going on in 
Palestine
, so whenever there 
was news available, 
I was particularly interested in. And so , as 
a result, I took a special interest in Jews. 
And one of my  assignments was to enter 
Germany
 as soon as we occupied a few 
villages around 
Aa chen
. And wh erever I went, I would ask, are any Œ wh at 
happened to the Jews. And the Œ 
Monschau 
didn™t have Jews, but in 
Aachen
, 
which we occupied around oc Œ middle of
 October, and I arrived there maybe two 
or three days after occupation, I learned 
from the public relations officer that one 
Jew had bi Œ had surviv ed. And the army  ha
d seen to it that he would get a s Œ a 
reasonable quarter, and he ga
ve me the address. So, 
I Œ you know, I Œ wasn™t 
difficult to find out where to go, because 
you asked people, and 
he was put into  a 
build ing that had been Œ the upper part ha
d been destroyed, but the first floor, the 
four walls were standing, there were no wi
ndows, the door could not be closed, but 
it was better than most, you know, l-living 
in a cellar. And he 
had put a big sign on 
the door, 
Jude
. And so  when I came in and intro
duced  my self, he was very happy 
to see me. He had a chair and insisted I si
t on the chair, and he stood, in his warm 
clothing, he had no gloves. So
 I gave him my  gloves and a scarf, and we talked 
about wh at happened . And he ex plained to 
me that just before deportation, the 
Germans deported all the Jews from 
Aach en
, but because they had Christian 
friends, he and his wife were able to 
move into the suburb  and be hidden. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
61
Unfo rtunately, his wife got caught in the 
city, and his Œ was deported. He Œ but he 
survived . And he described hims
elf as being a member of the 
B™nai Brith
 and 
didn™t know any Hebrew, but he had been
 to synagogues and knew something about 
prayers. And he thought that pr
obably he would be safe now in
 Aa chen
. But Œ and 
that™s why he put the sign up, 
and he felt that he was Œ he
 didn™t know of any other 
Jew who survived. Well, apparently the pe
ople in military gover
nment looked after 
him subsequently. He was seep Œ he got 
a job in military government as somebody 
who could be trusted, 
and ultimately turned 
out to be a member 
of the city council 
and became head of a new Jewish commun
ity, because there were a few survivors 
who drifted back to 
Aachen
 and so the province de
cided to facilitate the 
development of a Jewish commu nity, and he
 actually became its head, I think, for 
the rest of his life. 
Q: Did he have any details 
on where people were deported to, and wh at happened to 

them after they were deported? 
A: He knew they were deported, he
 didn™t know where. He knew about 
Theresienstadt
, but he didn™t Œ the details we re 
not known to him, it™s ju Œ they had 
disappeared, and he was really worried
 that they might not come back. 
Q: Now, you mentioned 
Theresie n stadt
; you yourself visited; you talk about that 
visit. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
62
A: What? 
Q: The visit to 
Theresienstadt
 that you made. 
A: Yeah. Now, when  
Buchen wald
 was liberated, by that time much of my work 
was to Œ well, nearly all of my work was to
 visit different cities or villages or camps 
that we had liberated, to write reports 
for supreme headquarters. So I decided I 
would go to 
Buchenwa ld
. All I had to do was tell Captain 
Harb er
(ph) I™d like to 
go to 
Buchenwald
, he said fine. I got orders 
[indecipherable]
 you know, within a 
few hours, and a driv er, and off we went. So th at™s how I got to 
Buch enwald
, to 
write reports. 

Q: What were your main impressions? 
A: Well, it was impossible to describe. 
I mean, you drove into a camp , and you 
were greeted with piles of corpses, maybe
 up as high as this Œ the ceiling here.  
Q: About how many days after lib eration was this? 

A: That was five, six days. When I arri
ved, I inquired how Œ how the former 
prisoners were being dealt w
ith, and I quick ly discovered
 that Jews had succeed ed 
to be in a special barracks, even though 
origin ally, the Americans had decided that 
prison Œ the people liberated, Poles woul
d go in to a barrack  and Yu goslavs and 
Germans, pris Œ inmates, and 
then they discovered that th
e Jews didn™t want to be 
with the Poles and didn™t want to be with
 the Yugoslavs, and th
ey simply refused. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
63
So, the local commander said okay, I™ll give
 you your own barrack
s. And Œ and that 
happened within 
Œ on the first day. So I went to 
the Jewish barrack and introduced 
myself, and we sat down, I said, what 
are the problems ? Are you getting enough 
food? And they said, well, we™re getti
ng our share. And Œ but they were 
complaining about the administrative prob
lems they had of getting recognized as a 
nationality. So we discussed the political as
p ects, pointed out to them that the 
British government had a strong, vested interest in preventing the establishment of 
Jews as a separate nationality, because 
of what was th Œ their commitment in 
Palestine
,
 
that they had made a decision that 
they made a mistake in 1917, there 
were many more Arabs than Jews, and they di
dn™t Œ they didn™t want to lose support 
of the Muslims, and so th
ey had made an agreemen
t, and until that can be 
overturned, the British were 
pushing very hard to oppose
 recognition of Jews. But 
on th e other hand, Jews shouldn™t be wo rri
ed, and simp ly, they had the power to 
refuse. They  should insist on whatever th
ey want, because there was strong political 
support of their position in th
e American Jewish community
, and to some extent in 
the British community. So they had done th
e right thing and th
ey should be very 

assertive an d so on. So we 
talked about that, basically 
was mos Œ much of the time. 
In addition to getting informa
tion for my reports, that wa
s the focus of my visit. 
After all, I only spen t maybe four
 or five hours in the camp. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

64
Q: Now, I know that one of your reports was on the children of 
Buchenwald
. Did 
you actually go into the children™s barrack? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And can you talk about yo
ur reaction wh en  you saw it? 
A: Well, ah Œ the Œ first of all, many child
ren were with adults, either because they 
were related, and I couldn™t quite unders
tand how they survived
, or because they 
were being looked after by adults who want
ed to protect them, and so on. So, the 
children and 
[indecipherable]
 adolescents lived for Œ with
 the Œ with the adults. I 
don™t recall that there was a children™s barrack. There were not many children. 
Q: And did any of the Jewish
 prisoners ask you to  take messages back? Did they put 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, a few, even in 
Buchen wald
 would give me letters, but not many. I wasn™t 
there long enough. 
It wasn™t like in 
Theresienstadt
. And so the Œ I think I got two 
or three letters in 
Buchenwald
. I was there for a very short period of time, because 
you know, I had to bring back
 reports to headquarters. For all I know, those reports 
were shared with upper level command. 
I couldn™t tell you ex actly who read them, 
but you know, like any reports coming in
 from the ground, sometimes they will 
reach Œ I™m sure some of them were read by 
Eisenhower
. And I did talk in these 
reports not only about conditions in th
e Œ and how the pris
oner of war were 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

65
organized and how they 
had been able to kill some of 
the guards, but I also talked 
about the fact that there were special pr
oblems with Jews who didn™t want to be 
with Poles, and certainly didn™t want to be
 with Germans. And those reports went to 
upper levels, whatever their impact Œ im
pact might have been, but certainly the 
American high level command became aware of
 the fact that this was a very touchy 
problem. 
Q: And then  wh at other camps did you visit? 
A: I Œ I visited 
Buchenwald
, and I was at 
Theresienstadt
. And 
Theresienstadt
 
was very unexpect
ed, because when 
Theresienstadt
 was liberated in late April, and 
the news came across, it wa
s in the Russian zone. 
Q: Before we get there, let me ju st ask 
one question en route. At this point, what 
information did you have about your pa
rents? When  did you Œ wh ere they had 
gone? 
A: I kn-knew nothing. 
Q: So did you know that Ge
rman Jews were sent to 
Theresienstadt
, or was just Œ 
A: There was a possib Œ I knew that
 many German Jews were sent to 
Theresienstadt
. So the possibility that th
ey might have gone to 
Theresienstadt
 
was there, and we knew Jews
 had survived there. So, as
 soon as that
 happened, I 
went to my commanding officer a
nd to ld him I™d like to go to  
Theresienstadt
 to get

the names of the liberated people. Did he 
think th is was a good id ea, even though it 
was in the Russian zone? And 
he thought it was. And so, within  hours I had orders, 
I think th ey were signed by General 
Bradley
, to go into the Ru
ssian zone, to the 
libera Œ to 
Theresienstadt
, to carry out the instructi
ons of the theater comman d er, 
that was 
Eisenhower
, that f Œ were my orders. Had a 
ja Œ had a driv er, and went to 
the commissary and stocked up with gasoline 
and food to the hilt, and off we went. 
I had been, as a child, in 
Ma rien ba d
, or 
M a riá n ské L á zn

, which in Czech. So we 
drove thro ugh th at community
, where I remembered the f 
Œ you know, a few places, 
and got to 
Prague
. We didn™t enco unter any Russian troops, because 
Theresienstadt
 was pretty close to as far as
 the Russians got. The Americans Œ 
Patton
 had actually gotten to 
Prague
, and then later had to withdraw from 
Prague
 
because of an 
agreement that 
Eisenhower 
had made with 
Stalin
 that 
Czechoslovakia 
would be turn ed over to them, so Œ 
but at that time, the first time 
we encountered Russians was in 
Theresienstadt
. And we were not allowed to enter 
the camp, because Œ the explanation wa
s there was a typhus epid emic, and we 
would have to wait until it was under contro
l. So for ab out two days, we found a 
place to sleep, we waited til the ca mp was open, and then over to 
Theresienstadt
 
and ask fo r the comma nding officer. Well,
 being the only American I™m taken 
immediately to the right place, and was 
invited into the barrack where he was

sitting, a room like this. And he™s surro
unded by a few people talking Russian. And 
I showed  him my  orders and he called over a 
translator to look at my orders and tell 
him what they were, and saw th e signature 
of my officer. So, pat me down, and then 
said 
[phone ringing] Œ
 so, it™s easier to talk on the 
phone without the hearing aid, 
because apparently they in
terfere with each other. So, 
b-before he answered me 
about the information, he 
said, through this interpre
ter, why are the Americans 
killing Russian soldiers? I said
, that™s impossible, they ar e our allies, they liberated, 
th-they Œ he said, well, I read it in  ﬁ
Pravda
.ﬂ I said, I certainl
y will check into it, 
and we

 headquarters 
[indecipherable]
. I didn™t ask him for a 
copy of th e report in ﬁ
Pravda
.ﬂ It didn™t Œ after that exchange, he dropped the 
matter. And he said, I s Œ I Œ I™m sending so
mebody to talk to the 
head of the Jewish 
community, so they will get ready, to get 
the names ready for you. And he poured a 
glass of liquor and offered me a big glass lik
e that. And I realized that I could never 
keep up with him, so I cur Œ 
it occurred to me how to get out
 of it, I said, I Œ I have 
a very sad problem. He says, what™s the 
problem? I have a ruptured  thorax , and 
alcohol will irritate it, I can™
t drink anything. Well, he fe
lt very bad about me, but he 
wanted to drink. And the whole table had 
been filled with bottles. I mean, the alc Œ 
the conc Œ the alcoholism among th e u
pper level comma nd was apparent. And 
underneath the table were radios that ha
d been  confiscated, so he offered me a

radio, wh ich I explained to him I had one, so
 I didn™t want to deprive others of the 
radio, so I didn™t take a radio. But then
 I was taken by a Russi
an soldier to meet 
Leo 
Baeck
, who was in charge of the Jewish co
mmunity. And we sat down on his bed. 
Q: Did you know who 
Leo Baeck
 was ahead of time? 
A: Yes. I knew who he was. I didn™t know he was the head of the Jewish 

community. I didn™t know had Œ he had surv
ived. I knew about him as a Reform 

rabbi in 
Berlin
, but I knew nothing else about him.  
Q: Tell me about your meeting with Rabbi 
Ba eck
. 
A: Well, the fact that h e survived was al
most incredible. He sa
id, well, the Germans 
apparently decided I sh ould live. Because 
so many other people were killed, some Œ 
some rabbis were sent to 
Auschwitz
.  They obviously though
t I was Œ would be of 
use to them. And he was describing a little b
it of how the camp was organized, that 
Jews were doing all the work, they been 
paid for the work, an
d with this money 
they would get their very limited rations. 
And they could use that money and I Œ I 

got some, you know, samp les of the money.
 And he had a register of all persons 
who had ever been there, in
cluding information wh en th ey were deported or Œ or 
murdered. And I got a copy, 
wh ich I took with  me, and delivered to headquarters. 
And I presume this ma y have been  used 
to evacuate the liberated people, which 
happened very quickly.

Q: Did you have a chan ce to go through 
the names? Did any sound familiar to you? 
A: Oh yes, I mean, I saw Œ the only one 
I saw was my  grandmother. She had been 
there, and I learned from somebody who knew
 her, when I mentioned this, that she 
starved to death, she died of malnutriti
on. She was 72 years of age. As did many 
other people. If they didn™t have good jobs
, where they could steal food, they had 
real pro Œ surviv al problems, because therations were rations that did not susta Œ 
allow you to sustain normal health. 
Q: Tell me, what was 
Leo Baeck™s 
reaction when you came in Œ and I assume you 
identified yourself as having been  a German Jewish refugee coming back with the 
Americans? 
A: Well, I mean, he Œ 
Leo Baeck
 at that time said he wasn™t sure what would 
happen, but he Œ he didn
™t want to go back to  
Berlin
, because he knew the 
community, he was among the last to be de
ported, so he Œ the synagogues had been 
burned or destroyed; the Jewish comm
unity center, there was Œ there was no 
community, so he had Œ he di
dn™t want to go back to 
Germany
. And he said, that™s 
true of most of the German Jews here. Bu
t some did want to go back because they 
had property and so on, but
 he had nothing left in 
Germany
. 
Q: Did he ask for your
 help with  anything? 
A: No.

Q: Did anybody else that you meet there ask for Œ 
A: The only thing people as
k for is to deliver letters. 
They recognized apparently 
that Œ I explained to people how I got ther
e, I said I was Œ that the Russians were 
willing to let us take the names, but it wa
s Œ the Russians were 
in charge, so they 
realized I couldn™t do anything, since it 
was t h e Russians. And apparently the 
Russians had treat Œ treated them Œ allowe
d them to organize the camp Œ well, the 
camp was already organized under the Germ
ans, but now they treated them with 
great respect, and they looked after th
e sick. And Russian physicians would be 
available to provide treatment, 
to provide medicines. In ot
her words, they wa Œ they 
were being given services by the Russians 
within the limits of
 what the Russians 
had, which was damn little. 
Q: Now, well, let™s go back. When you men
tioned that the registrar, that register 
that 
Leo Baeck
 had, mentioned dates that pe
ople were deported, did he know 
himself where the deportations were
 going? Did he know that these 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yeah, he knew Œ he knew th ey  went to 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: And did he know the rami fications? 
A: Yeah, he knew th ey  went to 
Auschwitz 
and he knew that they would Œ th ey 
would die there. I mean, he said, this wa
s Œ the Germans tried to misrepresent the

Red Cross, that this was a Œ a Jewish co
mmu nity, self-governed  by the Jews to Œ 
while they shou
ld not be in 
Germany
, they  could be in a community of their own, 
but this was just a showpiece. And so he Œ 
he certainly outlined this, and that the Œ 
the Nazis would punish Jews severely if th
ey violated any of the ru les and some 
Jews were Œ were hanged 
or shot. And wh en the camp  became overcrowd ed, they 
would deport some people to make room for 
others to come. And as far as he w as 
concerned, there was no futu re
 for German Jewry. That he did say. And he later on 
made that statement publicly, in 
England
. 
Q: So how long di
d you remain in 
Theresienstadt
? 
A: In 
Theresienstadt
, I think I was there for a day. We did not spend th e night 
there. My job was to get the information,
 go back. And they were pretty quick  in 
give Œ giving us the names. 

Q: And when you got back, 
and you presented the names 
in the register, did Œ was 
there any reaction among th e people in your
 unit when  they saw all the lists of 
deported, and that? 

A: Again, while there were many Jews in th
e system, they were all afraid to talk 
about the Jewish problem. 
Q: And they weren™t looking on their own in
 private to see if their families were 
there? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
72
A: No, no, no. I™m sure they
 were interested. I mean, 
I am sure my commanding Œ 
I™ve never discussed it with 
Ha rber
(ph), how b Œ wh en I Œ but when I think back of 
it, how come any time I wanted something, 
I got it? I was a sergeant, but I could get 
anything from 
Harber
(ph), and because of the fact 
that he personally was very 
symp athetic. But again, to protect himsel
f, he didn™t want to be viewed as a 
spokesperson fo r the Jews, especially sinc
e officially he wa
sn™t even Jewish. 
Q: And at this point Œ 
A: I mean, later on, 20 years later, he wrote a book about 
Palestine
, a very positive 
book about king Œ ab out how 
Palestine
 was working and so 
on. But this was the 
first time that 
Hans
 had ever even officially discussed his Jewish background. And 
later on I did meet him socially, and he spok
e very openly about 
the fact that he Œ 
his father had converted  out of purely op-
opportunistic purposes, but he certainly 
got no Jewish background, ot
her than what he acquired later on as he grew up.  
Q: And at this period of time, just as
 the war was ending, were you able to 
communicate Œ correspond at all to your brot
hers who were in the Jewish brigade? 
A: Well, in the army I was able to use m
ilitary mail to write to my brothers. There 
was no longer any possibility of writing to
 my parents after 19 Œ after December 
seventh Œ no, no, that™s not ri Œ eighth, 1941
. And I wasn™t in the army at that t ime 
anyhow, but there was no mail between the 
U.S.
 and 
Germany
. But there certainly 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

73
was mail b etween the 
U.S.
 and 
Palestine
. So I corresponded maybe once a week 
with my  brothers in 
Palestine
, and we continued to co rr
espond th rough army  mail, 
which was pretty efficient. So I knew that 
my  oldest brother ha
d been  stationed in 
Rome
 in 1944, in the Jewish 
brigade, and I knew his address. So I would send him 
copies of some of my  reports about wh at was going on in  
Germany
. And our 
reports, I think in today™s army  would, at 
least for weeks or months be consid ered 
confidential or secret, but security concer
ns didn™t exist at that time, so I had no 
qualms about sen Œ taking a report and se
nding my  brother a copy. And then  he 
translated the report in Hebr
ew and it got published in ﬁ
Haaretz
,ﬂ because in 
addition to being a soldier, ﬁ
Haaretz
ﬂ had asked him to be a Œ wh at Œ you know, a 
Œ a part time correspondent. 
Q: So which reports of yours, on wh
at topics, were republished in ﬁ
Haaretz
?ﬂ 
A: I don™t Œ I would have to look at the Œ at the actual reports. I think the report 

about 
Buchenwald
, and I think the report Œ I mean, part of the report on 
Theresienstadt
, and I think 
F ra nkfurt
, which had some Jewish content. 
Q: Now we Œ go back to the list of names. 
At this period of time, I k n ow the Jewish 

chaplains were collecting na
mes and trying to reunite families. Did the list ever 
make it to the Jewish chaplains? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
74
A: Oh, I™m s Œ I™m sure they Œ I mean, I do
n™t know what happened to the list, but 
considering the efficiency 
of the army , and consid ering, for example, what 
happened to one of my mother™s cousins that survived in 
Auschwitz Œ  
I mean in Œ 
in 
Buch enwald
. The various allied governments we re very quick in evacuating the 
[indecipherable]
 to 
Belgium
, to
 Holland
, to
 France
, to 
Italy
, you know, where 
you could Œ naturally, you couldn™t se
nd Œ Jews didn™t want to go to 
Poland
, Jews 
didn™t want to go to
 Russia
. So Œ and most Russian Jews
 were able to claim that 
they were Polish, and maybe they were. At
 any rate, I don™t remember that Jews 
were among those forced by the allies to go back to 
Russia
. So, I can™t tell you 
what happened to the list. 
But keep in mind, we had wh
at, two or three Œ Rabbi na-
nad Œ 
Na dich
, or something like that. 
Q: Oh, 
Judah Nadich
? 
A: 
Nadich
, and maybe one Œ one or two other, that
™s all the rabbis were available in 
the whole district. And they 
were very busy men. They ha
d to conduct services, and 
they were part of high level of command. 
So  they had problems
 getting around, as I 
did. And so my  hunch is that when th
e means became available, they were 
transmitted  to them. But I don™t know. 
Q: Now, after 
V-E Day
, your job changed a bit Œ 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

75
Q: Œ with  the occupation.
 What was your new job? 
A: Well, after 
V-J Day
, and even before ge Œ 
V-J Day
, once we en tered 
Germ any
 
in October ™44, the newspaper of 
Aach en
 and the newspaper later on of 
Co log n e
 
was shut down. And 
Ha rb er
(ph) convinced 
Eisenhower
 that we should establish a 
free press in German, which ultimately wouldbe turned over to 
the Germans, after 
they saw how a free press functions. And that
 was approved. So  he had approval to 
establish 10 German newspapers. 
Q: And why did they select the number 10? 
A: And they selected them in different citie
s, to cover whole regions. So there were 

two in 
Bavaria
, one in 
Munich
, and th e other one in 
Regensburg
. But when we 
occupied 
Reg ensburg
, we didn™t find a prin ting plant 
that operated. So, i-it had to 
be moved to 
Straubing
, but it was published as the 
Regensburg er
(ph)
 Post
. So, in 
Œ the 
Munich 
press ultimately became the 
Süddeutsche Ze itung
. It Œ It was, I 
think 
[indecipherable]
 but later on it became Œ when it became German, they 
changed the name. It is today 
Germany™s 
Œ one of 
Germ any™s 
top newspapers, like 
ﬁ
The New York Times
.ﬂ And 
Han s Ha rber
(ph) actually stayed in 
Germany
 after 
occupation ended and the Germans took 
over, to remain 
as editor of the 
Süddeutsche Ze itung
 for two or three years to get it going. So 
Harb er
(ph) decided 
he Œ he had 10 men, so each of us was 
given a newspaper. An
d I think two people 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
76
had occasionally written articles 
fo r newspapers, but none of us had been editors of 
a newspaper. But that™s how ha Œ 
Harbie
(ph) operated, so overnight I suddenly 
became editor of a newspaper. 
Q: Now, were you th is Œ just the editor? 
Were you also the only staff writer? Was 
there anybody work ing for you, or 
[indecipherable]
 operation. 
A: Well, I had no staff, I was sent to 
Straubing
 to-together with a administrative 
staff, there were two officers and three or 
four enlisted man whose job was to, first 
of all, find living quarters, and to have a k
itchen of food for the four or five me n and 
the Œ and me, as the editor. Basically, 
that unit existed to make sure I had 
transportation and fo od and able to run th
e newspaper. So my  Œ I decided that it Œ 
that the building of the press was well pres
erved, the ed itor had 
an apartment there, 
a very big apartment. And I decided that 
I mi ght as well live right in the newspaper. 
And my  commanding officer thought that, you
 know, it was a good idea, so I didn™t 
live with the other enlisted men in quarter 
that they had established; I had my  own 
quarters in the newspaper, so I c
ould be on top of everything.  
Q: And how often did 
the paper co me out? 
A: Once a week. 
Q: And where™d you get the articles? 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
77
A: So Œ so the articles, th
e Œ the press was based on a very  small staffing, because 
we didn™t have mu ch, all we had is this 
one Œ the editors. So wh at was done is that 
all 10 newspapers wo uld get the national, 
international news, which was produced 
by 
Harb er
(ph) and his staff in 
Bad Nauheim
. So, since each of the newspapers 
was four pages, there were three pages 
of national and international news, and a 
local page. As editor my job was to ge
t information for the local page. And I 
decided what goes to the local page.
 Harb er
(ph) didn™t have time to even  look at 
the local pages. 
Q: Do you remember th
e types of articles Œ 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: Œ subjects of any of your articles? 
A: So, it was up i-in Œ the other three pa
ges would be speeches by the president 

[indecipherable]
 speeches by 
Eisenhower
, speeches by 
Churchill
 and major news 
about wh at was going on in  
Russia
 and so on, but was all written in 
Eisenhower™s 
headquarter. And this was the first time I di
 Œ I flew, because they sent a helicopter 
to 
Bad Na 
Œ to 
Stra ubing
, pick  me up, take me to 
Bad Nauheim 
to get the material 
on Wednesday fo r the Friday™s newspaper, fl
y me back, just for that purpose. And it 
was a big scary, because these 
Piper Cubs
 are not well put together. I me an, you Œ 
when you sit in the 
Piper Cub
 there are two seats, the pilot and me. And you can 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton  
 
August 1, 2010 
 

 
 
78
look down on th e side of your seat becaus
e it was open, so you can look down. And 
you flew very low. The 
Piper Cubs
 don™t go up high Œ very 
high, so we were very 
close to the ground. And so  that happene
d every week, and I think once I was asked 
to drive in the 
Jeep
, and I drove myself. And so at a
ny rate, that™s how they got the 
Œ the main contact. Now, the local c-contac
t, that was entirely up to me. So you had 
to think of stories that would appeal to 
the Germans. And so I would have stories 
about food rationing, I would 
have stories about local military govern ment. I would 
have stories about opening of schools. I 
would have stories about some interesting 
hospital case. I also Œ I learned that there 
was a Jewish girl who 
had been hidden  by 
Germans, by 20 different Germans. So I 
Œ when I heard ab out it, I looked for her 
and I found out where she was. Her name, I think, was 
So nja
(ph) 
Navay
(ph), and 
she was 16 years of age, and she had been 
blonde. Her mo ther and father were taken 
away. She didn™t know where 
they were. But friends of the family  had hidden her 
and then  turned her over to others becau
se they felt it was too dangerous. So  20 
different German families, so I made that
 a feature story. And it was on my  page, 
and then  
Harber
(ph) decided that was a good story,
 so that became Œ was reprinted 
in all the other newspapers. So some of th
e stories I wrote were copied, and I came 
to the conclusion that 
the German governor of 
Bavaria  
was not too sy mp athetic 
towards Jews, because he urged that the 
policy that had been adopted that Jews 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

79
would get double rations, becau
se they had been so depriv
ed and emaciated, he felt 
that was unfair. And he lobbied  in favor of 
giving Jews the same amount of fo od as 
everybody else. So I d
ecided he has to go.  
Q: Did he ne Œ 
A: So, I mean, I Œ I wrote articles that 
criticized his policies, and I don™t know 

whether that™s why he ultimately 
was fired, but he was fired. 
Q: Did an yone at 
Straubing
 know that you were Jewish? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did th e Germans know you were Jewish? 

A: By that time they knew wa Œ they Œ th
ey knew I was Jewish. First of all, the 
editor that I replaced was a smart German
, a Swiss German. And, you know, when 
people asked me, I told them, so Œ so I di
dn™t go in to many deta
ils about my family, 
anything else 
[indecipherable]
. So th-the second reason why it became clear I was 
Jewish is because I featured stories about 
ous Œ the Jewish Œ the reorganization of a 
Jewish community in 
Deg endo rf
, where there has been no Jews, but 
DP s
 and how 
they were operating, or marriage of Jews 
in Œ of a Jew in some community. And the 
fact that it turned 
out that the secretary that had 
been fo und fo r me, somebody who 
was very good in German, 
turned out to be a Germ
an Jewish wo man who hu Œ 
who™s Œ had been a Polishnationality deported to 
Poland
, and there she was able to 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

80
hide that she was Jewish and survived as
 a Pole. And she was hired as a Pole, but 
when she discovered that I was very intere st ed in Jewish affairs and wrote reports 
on the subject, she confessed 
that she had been hiding 
her Jewish identity because 
she really didn™t think th at the Œ didn™t th
ink you could trust the Americans, since 
she had some early interactions with Ameri
can officers who tried to pressure her to 
sleep with them, and she felt they
 were just like the Germans. 
Q: Now, this time when you were in 
Regensburg
 and said that you also visited 
Hitler™s
 birthplace, and start to 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, that was Œ when 
Braunau
 was occupied  by the Am
ericans, I immediately 
said, I gotta go there and do a story about 
Hitler™s 
birthplace, so I drove there and 
just went to the militar y  governmen
t headquarters and there I met a Mr.
 Fagas
(ph), 
who looked a lot like 
Hitler
, but he had been  a socialist, had never been in th e 
party. He was appointed acting mayor. So  
I talked to him for a while and asked 
where Œ where™s 
Hitler™s 
birthplace? He took me there. 
It was a lib Œ public library, 
had been a public library. So
 I went into th e build ing and there were a lot of books 
and also the local newspaper had been pub
lished there, so they had a photographic 
division, a lot of German photographs. So  
I took a lot of the photographs that I 
thought would be of interest, many of 
wh ich I gave to, you 
know, delivered in 
Bad 
Nauheim
, but I kept some that interested 
me. And I also took some books of 
Hitler
 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

81
that Œ like a copy of ﬁ
Mein Kampf
ﬂ and photographic book
s of the fuehrer that 
came from his library. And I had the printing 
office make me a printed message that 
it was taken from 
Hitler™s 
birthplace. And then I met with the Œ Mi-Miss 
Fagas
(ph), and said, wh at are you going to  do with 
Hitler™s 
birthplace? He says, I 
don™t know. It™s certainly so
mething you have to deal w
ith. I said, I have an idea, 
let™s make it into a museum of the outra Œ 
atrocities of the Nazis. He liked that idea, 
and so he said, all right, we™ll do it. And,
 what are you going to exhibit? Well, he 
said, that Œ we have to  get information of 
th ings that could be put there, like ma ybe 
the 
Nuremburg 
laws, and some of the info Œ illustra
tions of Nazi™s atrocities. A nd I 
offered to get some placards that could 
be ex hibited, and when  I went back to 
Straubing
, I got ahold of the local Catholic pr iest and told him that there was a 
museum, and I was wondering where there 
were some Biblical phrases that h e 
could think of that would appropriately 
describe the evil of the Nazis. So Œ 
Q: What Œ what sort of phr
ases did he come up with? 
A: He came up by Œ in my  Œ the material I 
gave you, the actual text from the Bible 
was selected, and I had them print it up on a large placard, and then took the 
material and they framed it, they 
Œ I think they framed it for me in 
Straubing
. The 
Œ the Germans who had been  running 
the Nazi printing plant became my 
employees, because there was no one else. In
 other words, we didn™t replace them.

And they  were very cooperative. I neve
r Œ no one ev er asked me about being 
Jewish, but I™m sure they all knew, and 
because you know, obviously , I spoke such 
good German, and my  secretary, who wa
s bi Œ by that time was known she was 
Jewish. And there also was a incident, my 
fa Œ my secretary, after she was freed, 
she had to  fill out a questionnaire and she 
was afraid to reveal that she was not 
Polish. She didn™t trust the Germans, 
the Œ our officers. S o  she filled it out 
according to her false papers, not realizing 
that she was providi
ng false information. 
And when she openly admitted 
that she was of German background and of Jewish 
background and not Polish, the Œ one of th e Œ the sia Œ the security people decided 
she had violated the law, she had falsif
ied her identity, and ch
arged her for having 
done so. I talked to them, and they says, we
 have no choice, she did it, and we have 
to prosecute. So I wrote up a defense and th
ere was a trial, so this was public. The 
other thing that surely made clear to peop
le that I was Je wish was the fact that I  
found out that there was a synagogue in
 Straubing
. And so they showed me where 
it was. It was dirty and had been used as
 a storeroom, but it hadn™t been burned  in 
Kristallnacht
 because it was a b u ilding in
 a whole row of buildings, 
undistinguished, and if you had tried to 
burn  it, you would have burned others Œ 
places down. So I decided it needed to be re
stored, and went to the German Œ th-the 
Œ well, I think the mayor actually came to my
 office when I asked for it. I told him

this Œ we had to clean up th e synagogue, 
and I ask him also th
at this be done by 
people wh o had damaged it, if their name
s could be identified. And he was not a 
Nazi, he had been put in the office. So he
 was able apparently, 
to find out who did 
it, and so the me mb ers of the family, who had been in th e 
SS 
or 
SA
 and had 
damaged the interior of the build ing, had 
to come with brooms and paintbrush es and 
clean up the place. 
Q: Did you cover this in your newspaper? 
A: And that I put in the newspaper as a story, and ag ain it was published all over 
Germany
. And the Œ the interesting part was th
at one of the rabbis I just met now, 
in Œ I th Œ I think it was the rabbi in 
Nuremburg
, actually had been Œ there is a 
Jewish community now in 
Stra ubing
, and it is operating. It™s
 not very large, but the 
synagogue is being used . So  these kinds of
 things, I could do, simp ly because I had 

the authority to select wh
at things to write about. 

Q: Now I understand that yo
u were also doing some thin
gs in a different capacity Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ that you were work
ing together with the 
Bricha
. 
A: Now, because my  brother was in the Je
wish Brigad e, and kne
w my  address, and 
knew my  telephone numb er, a
nd he could tell people in 
the Jewish Brigade, who 
were being released temporarily by the brig
ade, to organize the rescue of Jews in

eastern 
Europe
. The brigad e just had enough au
tonomy to arrange their Œ the 
mission Œ th e execution of the missions that 
they had, mostly tr
ansportation. They 
had trucks to move from 
Italy 
to 
Holland 
and  
Belgiu m
, and they  did a lot of 
transporting. So  wh at they did is they orga
nized their crews so that about two-thirds 
did the work and one-third were released 
to Œ given ex -extended leave to go into  
eastern 
Europe
 to either visit the s Œ village or 
city where they came from, and to 
help Jews to organize, in order to get to
 the American zone, because th-there was no 
future for Jews in eastern
 Euro pe
. And in order to increase the numb er of Jews who 
wanted to go to 
Palestine
, you had to first bring th em to 
Germany
. And so there 
were agents of the Jewish Brig
ad e, whose job it was to go into  
Czechoslovakia
 and 
Poland
, and 
Straubing
 is close to the Czech border. So they had my  name and 
telephone numb er so they could call me from 
Munich
 and say they  needed  my  
advice, could I see them? And I wo Œ of co
urse always would sa
y yes. And this way 
I became well-known, apparently, on this gr
oup of underground workers, and they 
would co me to 
Straubing
 and they needed a place to sl
eep at night, which I could 
provide, and food. And then I woul
d get them to the Czech border. 
Q: Did an ybody notice that you had these 
guests coming, my sterious guests, or 
were you able to keep it a secret?

A: Nobody paid much
 attention to what I was doing.
 That Œ the Germans didn™t pay 
Œ you know, I had no one ch
eck on what I was doing a
nd it was perfectly legitimate 
for the editor of the newspa
per to interview 
anybody. So, it was reasonable for me 
to interview visiting dignitari
es. The fact that they ca
 Œ happened to come from 
Palestine
 Œ my  comma nding officer wa
sn™t interest Œ I mean, the Œ he was not my 
commanding officer, because he had no au
thority over the newspaper. He Œ he was 
responsib le for making sure my  
Jeep 
was operating properly and that I had the 
necessary fuel and food. He wasn™t at 
[indecipherable]
 the newspaper was not his 
job, so he didn™t intervene at all. I™m not 
sure he even looked at Œ at the paper I put 
out. He had a German girlfriend, and ha
d a wo nderful time, you know, had nothing 
to do, so I don™t think he 
ever once ever asked me 
about my work, because my 
command was not Œ he was not Œ I was 
not under his command. My commanding 
officer was, by that time, Major 
Hans Harber
(ph) in 
Bad Nauheim
, or in 
Frankfurt
, where supreme headquarters were
 lo cated . T h at was my  co mman d . 
Q: And how long di
d you remain in 
Straubing
? 
A: Well, my job ended when the newspa
per was turned over 
back to a German 
editorial board, about November ™45. By
 that time, nearly all the newspapers, 
maybe with a week or two difference, we
re turned over to th
e Germans, and the 
program of 
U.S.
 operated German newspapers came to an end. And I had 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

accumulated enough points to 
be sent home. But because of
 the fact that there was a 
army program that permitted soldiers in 
Europe
 to visit relatives if they were 
available, I decided to  take advant
age of that, and I went, I think to  
Bad Nauheim
, 
and asked to meet with my  brother in
 Palestine
. And th at was approved, but a few 
hours later, while waiting around , I was told sorry, Sergeant 
Eaton, Palestine
 is 
closed. The British have closed Camp 
Litwinski
, near 
T el Aviv
, a recreational 
facility for American sailors 
and soldiers, and ask all Am
ericans to leave. There™s 
no way fo r you to go to 
Palestine
 because there were several generals who wanted 
to go to 
Palestine 
for Christmas, but who were refu
sed. So I f Œ thought quickly, 
and said, but could I meet my  brother in 
Cairo
? If you can get transportation. So I 
gave them the address of a school friend at 
Cornell University
, a Jew from 
Ir aq
, 
who had moved from 
Bag hda d 
to  
Ca iro
, and I knew his address because he had 
sent me an invitation to his wedding in  
Ca iro
. So I got permission to go 
[indecipherable]
 I wanted to see my  brother, and 
so they approved
 it. And when 
the orders were printed, they were prin
ted like all other orders, to carry out th e 
instructions of the commander, without 
specifying anything ex cept I was put on 
detached duty fo
r two weeks in 
Ca iro
 to carry out instructions of the theater 
commander. That was 
Eisenhower
. So, my commanding o
fficer, who knew why I 
was leaving, what I went doing, said that
™s wonderful. I don™t care how long you 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

87
stay, because when you g-go 
back, you going home. We don™t need you any more. 
So again, I™m not sure every commanding
 officer would have taken that position. 
So, I had to find my way to go to 
Cairo
. Well, there was no Œ I didn™t get orders, 
transportation orders, because 
there was no way to get to 
Ca iro
 from 
Straubing
, 
Germany
. So I pack ed up a duffel bag and hitchhiked to 
Rome
, because I knew in 
Rome
 we had an air force base, and I had fo
und out that we had plan es flying from 
Rome
 to the 
Middle East
. So when I got to 
Ro me
, I found out that there were no 
planes going to 
Palestine
, there were no planes going to 
Cairo
, but there were a lot 
of planes going to 
India
, and th ey had to stop off in 
Ba ghda d 
to refuel. So, 
showing my  orders, I got orders to fly to 
Bag hdad
 and then I would find a way of 
going to 
Ca iro
 from
 Bag hda d
. Nobody told  me how I would do it. I got to 
Bag hda d
, and in 
Baghdad
 a British officer looking at my  orders said, you are very 
lucky Sergeant 
Eaton
, we have a plane going to 
Cairo
 in an hour. But I didn™t want 
to go to 
Cairo
, I want to go to 
Palestine
. So I said, well I can™t go to 
Cairo
 now, I 
have to go to 
Ba ghdad
 first. He said, it doesn™t say in
 your orders. I said, I have to 
go to 
Ba ghdad
 first. And, I can™t let you go to 
Ba ghdad
, it™s does Œ not in your 
orders. So I said, would you put in writing that you™re refusing to  let me go to 
Bag hda d
? He didn™t want to do 
that, so instead, he accepted my request and he 
issued a voucher for me to go to  the best hotel in 
Baghdad
, where the British 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

88
officers were staying, to get a room at 
British expense. And I said I would find a 
way of getting to 
Ca iro
 by bus. And I did. I got a
hold of a bus, there were bus 
service every few days from 
Baghdad
 to
 Dama scus
. And from 
Damascus 
I got a 
ba Œ a bus to 
Ruspina
. And then I spent thre
e and a half weeks in 
Palestine
, in 
American uniform, knowing that under British 
rules, I™m not supposed to be there. 
No one ev er stopped me.  
Q: Just stop you one second. 
A: And the French really were
 willing to be part of a new 
Euro pe
, but it was the 
Jews who prevented this. So that as a Œ an 
Œ and th is was also in
 ™45 already. In ™46 
the British felt they could 
not change the policy in 
Palestine
, and therefore actually 
you had a rebellion of Jews 
against the British. And the 
whole uncertainty of what 
would happen to all these displaced persons,
 the ba Œ of course, after my  newspaper 
was over, and I no longer had a position,
 I Œ I was offered a job in military 
government in 
Germany
 by th e 
U.S.
 Army , with a pro Œ with a promotion to 
captain. But I didn™t want to live among Ge
rmans, and I wanted to  finish my  
academic career, so Œ and I didn™t really 
like the American polic
y in general, which 
was to work  very  closely w
ith the lower level German 
officials, which I didn™t 
particularly like, although today I realize 
that if we had done what we did in 
Iraq
, 
of dismissing th e infrastructure of 
Saddam Hussein
, we really didn™t have the 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

89
means to govern  the co untry. And so we rea
lly didn™t have mu ch of a choice, except 
to use a great many officials in the same pos
itions that they had occupied  under the 
Nazis, as lo ng as they had not been exce
ssively active, and known to  have been  Œ 
have Œ have en-engaged in atrocities. So
 major anti-Semites, judges who convicted 
too many people to death for stealing fo od
, or for racial fo Œ fo  Œ disapproved 
sexual relations or th ings like that, they lo
st their job. But mo st judges, mo st Nazi 
judges stayed as Nazi ju
dges. And so by th e time I could have become maybe the 
governor of this or that city in 
Germany
, I would have had to deal with these kinds 
of officials, so no, I 
wanted to finish my 
PhD
. So that Œ th e Œ but certainly the Œ one 
other thing is, once I started to go back i Œ go into teaching, my  focus was on my 
professional career. So I had research ideas,
 and I got adequate funding fo r research. 
So I focused on research, I didn™t return to my army da
ys or take a look at my 
extensive files of what ha
ppened in World War II. I di
dn™t think of myself of 
somebody who was a historian of 
Germany
, World War II. I had lots of interesting 
records of things I did, and they  were put
 in boxes, and these boxes got transp orted 
from this home to that home, and I was alwa
ys too busy to really look at them, of 
what was in there, because I had many ot
her interesting professional challenges, 
until after my retirement, I started looking 
at the material. And I™m now engaged in 
writing a history of how my  family inter
acted with the German
 culture over many

90
centuries. Because one has to f
ace the fact th at historically, 
Germany
 was never 
just a country of Germans. There was alwa
ys an existing minority that had a very  
important function, namely the Jews. 
Q: And when you lo ok at all the documents 
that you accu mu lated wh en you were in 
the army, you™re looking at them fresh afte
r so manyyears, is there anything that 
surprises you, that you view differently 
in retrospect than you did at the time? 
A: Yes. The Œ I mean, for hundreds of ye
ars, on both sides of
 my family, they 
remained Orthodox, even th
ough a large proportion of the German Jews became 
Reform Jews. On my father™s
 sid e they were quite cons
ervative. On my mother™s 
side, they took advantage of modern 
secular education, but they remained 
Orthodox. I had relatives as fa
r back as 1835 who went to 
Palestine
, because they 
wanted to  live there. I Œ on my  mo ther™s side, I had people going to
 Palestine
, 1882. 
The Œ so that my family was clearly Or
thodox. Two of my  brothers rema ined 

Orthodox. My oldest brother and I, especia
lly under the influen
ce of the Holocaust, 
I became convinced there is no superior 
po-power looking after exactly what™s 
happening to any of us. And that if there 
is some rational power that explains the 

incredible complexity
, and the Œ the uniformity of many
 things in nature; the fact 
that we have 
DNA
 th at we shor Œ share with earthworms and with  butterflies. 
There™s s-some incredible rationality that
 somehow has develope
d an evolution for 

 
Interview with Joseph Eaton

91
which I have no explanation. Bu t I don™t th
ink there is a g od wh
o decides that I™ve 
been a good person, or I have had significant faults, on the basis of which my 
afterlife would be. So, I Œ I am not an
 Orthodox Jew to day. And Œ but I am 
identified with the Jewish 
community  for ethnic reasons. So from that point of 
view, I had an opportunity to
 do th ings during those unus
ual periods of time, which 
the only other time I was able to express my 
interest in being Jewi
sh is when I took 
a job for five years to establis
h a school of social work  in 
Haifa University
, and 
they needed an outside person who was not 
involved in Israeli 
politics. And so they 
brought me in because university wanted to
 establish a school that would compete 
with 
Hebrew University
 and have a different ideol
ogy, so I took that job. 
Q: Okay . Well, thank you very
 much. This concludes the
