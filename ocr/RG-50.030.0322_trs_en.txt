SO LOMON FO X 
April 27, 1995 
 
01:01:00  Question: Will you start by telling me 
your na me , date of birth, and where you were 
born please? 
Answer: My name  Sol Fox.  Now it's Sol Fox.  It was in Polish, where we lived before, 

Shlomi ck Fuchs.  I was born September 2, 1922 
in Lodz, Poland to a very, very well to do 
fa mily.  We  were seven children.  We were seve
n children, one sister and six brothers.  I was 
amongst the two youngest.  The distance between me and my next brother was four years.  

Therefore they already were involved in the family business,
 while I and my younger brother 
were going to this very famous high school.  If I 
mi ght explain at this mo ment, what it meant to 
get a high school education where we come  from.  In
 this country it's  comp ulsory to have a high 
school education.  Where we come  from in Poland, 
only seven classes of basic school, you call it 
Public school, was 01:02:00  compulsory.  High 
School was either private or they also had 
governme ntal subsidized, taxpayers subsidized 
hi gh schools.  Those accepted only two percent 
of a s mall percentage of Jewish st
udents, and they had to be the best.  Therefore, to afford to go 

to high school, you had to had support of a fami l y that
 could afford it.  It 
was expensive.  Almost 
all in my family did have education at high 
school education and me  and my younger brother 
who went together, that was a big 
expense for my parents.  In th
is way, I'm paying homa ge to my 
parents.  A ve ry bright  future was in sight th
at my father, should he rest in peace, planne d 
particularly for me .  Not  that 
I'm trying to point myself out th
at I was an exceptional son, which 
was not true at all, because my younger brothe
r wa s the darling of the house.  He was much 
smarter and better student, but my fa ther had pl
anned at least one of his sons to become  an 
angromomis t and go to Israel.  That was supposed 
to be me .  So, by that I'm trying to stress the 
fact how this Holocaust business broke lives from
 the Shoresh, in Hebrew it means from the root. 
I am glad I injected a Hebrew word. So, we ha
d a norma l, beautiful, very beautiful life.  My 
parents, as I say, were well to do people.  I mi
ght add at this point that my mother and my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

grandfather, I come  from a reli
gious home .  My father was dre
ssed religiously, not
 any more the 
children.  We started to get modernized.  But 
my  grandfather even owned his own synagogue.  
The synagogue that we were pray
ing in, it was like a private s
ynagogue.  I'm not talking about a 
big building synagogue.  It was li
ke in his private home .  He 
was a wealthy ma n, and he owned 
the building, so he allowed one room for prayers 
only on Saturdays.  Hims elf, my pare nts, were 
going for like you go here to Sarasota, you know, to 
baths, will that be explainable?   To 
Germany, M a rienbad, Francisbad, Ka rlsbad, and wh
en they came  back they had the biggest 
praise.  They were doing that for many years before Hitler, before Nazism.  So, when this thing 
came on us, the shock wa s yet bi gger, because my
 parents and my grandfather, and anybody who 
ever had contact with the German pe ople, coul
dn't  understand what happened.  How could they 
turn into, and I must say it, and I promised myse
lf on one of t he notes, I would not be sarcastic 
and I will not be insulting to 
Germany as it is, not as I knew before.  I don't know how they are 
now.  I really don't.  But , how could they have
 changed into --- oh, oh, see I lost my thought.  

Some times we say when some body is bad you say he's
 vicious.  He's worse than an animal.  
Whenever I get to this point, I say I cannot insult 
the kingdom of ani mals.  I hate to see it, but it 
really come s out of me .  Those Germans, if I w
ould put it at the mildest, not wanted to insult 
today's Germans, though in doing me a lot of ha
rm already for the last 50 years.  I was in 
Germany only six months.  I don't want to insult the kingdom of animals, because they were 

definitely absolutely worse.  You cannot imag
ine how vicious they were.  You cannot imagine 
the devotion that they had to that Fuehrer.  B
ecause I learned German in s c hool, too.  We learned 
Hebrew, German, Polish and Latin in our high sc
hool.  It was multi-language.  Polish was the 
ma in language.  Hebrew was second, German wa
s third.  My German teacher was a lady who 
came from a very religious, Jewish home  in 
our city of Lodz, Schneiersohn.  Everybody knew 
the religious fa mily of 
Schneiersohn.  There was nothing wrong 
with the Schneiersohns to have a 
daughter speaking and teaching German to students 
with the deepest German dialect.  So, when I 

have to say it, I know how to and it happened in Cour
t.  I had an incident when I said it in deep 
German and I'll maybe e xplain later what it was.
  The way the whole thing done in the most

murderous, vicious, sadistic, as my teacher sai
d, that he couldn't find words in the world's 
lexicons,_ dictionaries to expre
ss the viciousness and the pain of
 the Holocaust expe rience.  I 
went through high school.  Our system had four
 classes and two which was called Lyceum.  I 
ma de 01:09:00  it through the first of Lyceum be
cause the Germans invaded on Friday morning, 
5:00, 1939, September 1.  On September 2, as you reme mbe r  I was born on September 2, was 

my birthday, my 17th birthday.  We  did not yet rea
lize the sc ope of the tragedy even if Nazism in 
Germany started in '33 or even before.  We  hear
d things, even if the me dia was not as developed 
as today, but we knew, because it was only a bor
der away.  So, when it came , we knew that a 
tragedy was comi ng.  We didn't even use the word
 tragedy.  We knew tough times were comi ng.  

Bad people are comi ng.  The Germa ns are hurting us, 
even killing some , but little did we realize 
the scope of it.  To get as I am sa
ying, to try and tell it is to do injust
ice to it.  It's impossible.  Let 
me  try to give you some  small instances.  My sist
er was ma rried a year before the war, therefore 
her baby was born the 26th of August one week befo
re the wa r.  Being that my parents were able 
to afford, and she ma rried also a very well to do husband, they got an apartment for her in a very 

fine neighborhood, and it was equipped to the 
tee.  Why not?   She was the only daughter. 
Q. Was this a Jewish neighborhood? 

A. This was not the very Jewish neighborhood 
where she moved to.  She mo ved sort of like 
to the City.  There were Ghetto neighborhood, wh
at we called Ghetto neighborhood.  I lived in a 
Ghetto neighborhood.  I was born there.  This wa s th
e center of Jewish life in the city.  Then 

came the business section where we had our business,
 and my sister lived further down.  It was a 
mi xed neighborhood.  As a ma tter of fact, it was di
agonally across from my wife 's  high school.  
But then we didn't realize it.  But, I'm aimi ng 
at some thing.  The name , t he landlords of that 
building, were German.  The population of our city had a lot of Jews, Germans, and Poles.  The 

population was about 900,000 of which 30 percent was 
Jewish and a lot of Ger mans.  Now, these 
neighbors we re Germans, the Richter fa mily.  Very 
wealthy in the steel indu
stry.  As soon as the 
Germans arrived and we noticed how bad it got a
nd everybody started running in all directions, 
my father, my parents -- we were still intact, br
ought my sister and he r ba by to our house.  That 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

she shouldn't be alone there, because her husba
nd had to go to attend to his problems.  
Everybody had problems.  When she came back to th
e apartment, it was empty.  Mrs. Richter, 
the millionaire German landlady, emptied my sister's
 apartment, because it was all new.  She was 
just married.  I was chosen by my father becau
se I learned German in school, so he helped 
himself with me  rather than w
ith the other children 
and not with my younger brother.  You see 
my younger brother's picture there in the back?   
Because he wa s still too young.  I was already 
like a ma n, and I knew the language.  He says go as
k Mr. Richter what happened.  So, I went.  I 
knocked at the door.  It was one f
light up, left door, and she opened the door and I said Frau 
Richter, "Wer hat meiner Schwester Moebel 'r au
sgenomme n?   " Sie sind  
doch tod" she said to 
me . " I was yesterday at the party me eting."  Ho
w did I know that she belongs to the party. " We  
were told that you were all dea
d.  Why do you need furniture so I 
took it out".  Can you imagine 
anything like that.  I was shocked.  This was the 
fi rst real shock that went through me .  Because 
the next shock didn't take very long when they 
confiscated completely our business.  Where we 
lived, as I said before, was the Jewish neighborhood where the Ghetto was then formed 

eventually.  All the others were pushed in he
re, and we had to share the apartment with 
everybody.  But to come  to the story of how fast 
they liquidated our businesses.  We  had three 
stores, retail stores, besides whol
esale shoes.  On the ma in street like here you would say Fifth 
Avenue or 14th Street, call it an
ything you want, but the ma in bus
iness section.  They drove up 
with trucks.  Asked no questions.  Broke in the d
oors, emptied everything and took it away.  But 
they left a receipt with an address where to co
me for payme nt, but the way the whole thing was 
done was already scary besides we kn
ew what's going on in Germany. 
Q. When was this? 

A. '39,i mme di ately. 

Q. In September, right away? 

A. A week, two weeks later.  Imme diately.  So, 
again, my father turned to me .  Who woul d 
go?   As I told you before my father was 01:14:)) 
Jewishly dressed.  Had the beard and pyes, like 
a religious ma n.  Naturally, he wouldn't go.  He wouldn't send boys because we figured boys is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

more dangerous.  But we still underestimated 
-- rather overestimated the German character 
figuring that if a woma n will go, they wouldn't 
beat them or do anyt
hing wrong to a woma n.  
Men, it's mo re dangerous.  So, it was decided that 
mother went.  It was already curfew.  5:00 was 
curfew.  Mother went with this rece ipt to the 
place where they were told to come , and curfew 
time ca me  closer and mo ther didn't come  back.  She's not here.  You know we 'r e in trouble.  We  
realized we'r e in trouble and star
ted being very, very nervous about
 it, and again come  close to 
curfew, Father chose me  and says go there.  We  knew the addr ess where she went.  See where 

Mother is.  There's not question 
that you went.  I went there.  
We still didn't know the score that 
it was dangerous even to ma ke a 
step on the street.  I went ther
e, into the animal's mouth, you 
know, into an office where my mothe r  was already in 
jaihl.  I came  there it was already dark.  It 
was getting dark.  So, the lights were on in thes
e offices, and I just st
arted walking around.  I 
could have been squeezed to death or shot to de
ath or killed or taken right away.  They didn't 
probably realize who I am i mme diately.  I didn't 
see mother.  Now, i magine that I came back 
without mother, because curfew was over, I was stil
l able to take a tram.  Still able to gr ab on 
and get home a little past curfew
.  We didn't know that you could ha
ve gotten killed for being out 
on curfew, but I come  without Mother.  We  never seen her.  That's when we escaped to Wa rsaw.  

After a few days or weeks, I don't reme mber ex
actly, Father decided because Litzma nnstadt,  
Lodz was turned into the name Litzmannstadt  an
d it was getting terrorized.  The city was getting 
terrorized more and more every mi nute and we reali
zed that being that they already have mother 
in, they'll lead to us.  Meaning, ma inly we talk 
of Father.  The decision was that my father and 
his sons, all of my brothers, and my sister a
nd her baby are escaping to Wa rsaw, which was only 
supposed to be only occupied te
rritory.  Not incorporated in
 the Reich, not the Holy Land. 
Q. Let me  ask you a question.  When you say 
the City was becomi ng more terrorized, what 
was happening on the streets? 

A. That's a good question.  The Germans came in
 shortly before - that's a good question -- 

shortly before Rosh Hoshana.  The Jewish New 
Year.  Before the war started, already feeling 
that it was comi ng, we were diggi
ng on order of the governme nt, we ha d to dig shelters in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
6 
 
street against bomb attacks.  Let me  say some
thing, yet better.  Before they came in, big 
announceme nts were hung out, what do 
you call these announcements on walls? 
Q. Posters? 
A. Yes, yes.  That it is not true the rumo rs 
that you're hearing about the atrocities about the 
German Army and the Germans is not true.  
Come  out whe n you see the German Army when 
they come  ma rching in, and greet them.  You he
ar that?   And everything was going fine and 
smooth.  We  have seen an Ar my that we didn't ev
en imagine exists because  the Polish Ar my was 
a thousand years behind with litt
le horse and buggies.  Here at
 once you see a motorized, not one 
horse, everything in tanks and on tr
ucks.  We  went out in the ma
in street and nothing happened.  
That lasted only a day or two.  Then they starte
d grabbing Jews and burying them in the shelters.  
That's  what happened. 

Q. They shot the Jews? 

A. No, they didn't  need to shoot you.  If he 
wanted, he could shoot you.  They didn't ma ke a 

big tsimme s, a big deal about how you died.  Th
ey wanted you to die the most mi serable way.  
So, throwing you into a ma ss shelter like that 
and covering you up, to them that was a very 
befitting way to doing it to Jews.  Anyway, we
 decided to escape to Warsaw. Escaping to 
Warsaw.  How do you escape to Wa rsaw?   Do you buy a ticket on the plane or on the train.  Do 

you take your car from the garage?  There wa
s no such thing.  Number one, we were 
imme diately forbidden to use public transportatio
n.  Anyway, it was still the beginning and there 
was still some  horse and buggies and imagine 
when I think of it now, that by horse and buggy 

and the winter got tough, like in spite, very cold
 and a baby also with us, and we ma de it finally 
to Warsaw.  It's easier said than
 done.  So, now to describe the 
terror that happened in these few 
weeks is as 01:21:00  impossible as to describe
 the whole thing, because when you're  talking 
about terror, is not only that some thing ha
ppened.  Say, some body gets killed by a car.  
Some body gets killed by a brick falling down.  That's
 a tragedy, but that's  not terror.  That's  why 
I don't call myself a survivor and I already was ta
lking with our organization.  I'm not big mi xer, 
I don't push.  We 'r e not survivors, we are victims.
  Because a survivor is one who gets hurt by 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

any means and then he gets revived and if the ot
her person or  realtor has 
any type of insurance 
which they do, they will be ma de good for.  They'll 
take him to a hospital, and if he's lucky he'll 
come  back as a survived person.  We  are not survivers.  We  suffered day and night.  Be cause 
why did my wife have to have a 
dream fi ft y years later that  they take the children and it's cold 
outside and they don't have socks on.  This is no
t one occasion.  If it's a 
funeral, a bar mitzvah, a 
wedding, a card game  a restaurant and we were this
 week twice, that this thing does not come  up 
amongst us.  I don't know if you did realize it.  Th
is is why my neighbor Mary once said to me , 
"Sol, why don't you start living a norm
al life?   Ge t it out of your mi
nd."  Easy said.  Get it out of 
your mi nd.  I wish it could.  There 
is not a day, if more than once a day, if we go to sleep, if we 
go to eat, if we meet for a game , if we go for a 
walk, always come s up.  Th
is was -- it cannot be 
told.  It cannot be told.  As my teacher said, he
 cannot find expression in 
the dictionaries of the 
languages.  You can see that we can go on and on 
forever.  If you need to go home  to sleep, you 
will not.  So, ask me  questions which will lead me in, otherwise I get lost  in it. 

Q. You ma de your way to Wars
aw.  Did you go directly there? 
A. Oh, you got me  back on track.  So, we  ma de 
our way to Wa rsaw.  Father, six of his sons, 
no, five of his sons.  One of our brothers died 
before the war.  Five sons, his only grandchild 
which was the light in his eye.  She was only a 
few weeks old, our first gr
andchild.  My brother-
in-law did not come  along because he had a bi
g business to take care of.  He was a big 
businessman.  I'll tell you how he died.  He
 was thrown out of a hospital window by the 
Germans.  We will get to that .  Now, we are in Warsaw. 

Q. You went directly there?  You didn't stay --? 

A. You don't go so directly by horse and 
buggy to Warsaw, you know.  We  stopped over in 
different places to sleep over a
nd we slept on the street and we  
slept in Konushki(?
) on city not 
so far.  The rabbi of Konushki(?), his son rather
, opened his house for the 
escapees, and we slept 
on the floor, ma sses of us.  When I say we ma de
 it to Wa rsaw, it wasn't  the same  day.  The 
locomotives didn't say, hey we'r e in Warsaw. No, 
so, we got to Wa rsaw, now we are home less.  

A whole homeless fa mily.  There were no brokers
 or realtors to cont
act before or anybody 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

provide me  a roof over my head.  But some how
, Father had plenty of mo ney, he got an 
apartment.  It happened to be by coincidence th
e apartment was placed right across the street 
from the so called Pawiak.  Pawiak was the mos t  famous prison in Poland or in Wa rsaw where 
the first Marshal Pilsudski was imprisoned by th
e Russians.  By coincidence the building was 
right across the street from there. 
 So, we located ourselves.  I'll te
ll you a little story about this as 
a side pi ece that happened in Hollywood between 
me  and a Jew from Warsaw.  Anyway, so my 

sister became the housekeeper.  She never did th
at before.  She was just ma rried.  She had 
housekeepers.  She had everything.  She didn't even
 know how to ma ke a glass of tea, like any 
young woman.  After a while my fat her says what
 did we achieve.  Whe r e is Mother?   We  
escaped to save our skin and we don't even know 
where Mother is.  And here again he appointed 
that my oldest brother, who passed away last year , and me  to go back to Lodz to look for Mother. 

Q. I just want to ask you a question.  First 
of all, how long were you in Wa r s aw about? 

A. Afewweeks. 

Q. Were the conditions any better ther e? 

A. Just ask everything.  Yes.  You did not 
feel the Germans on top of you.  It was still 
reigned by a Polish puppet governme nt, because  as 
I said before Lodz 
was the Reich.  Hitler 
reigned already that while the othe
r was protected, Protecto
rate they called it, occupi ed territory.  
The admi nistration was so to say, not Germa
n.  That would be wrong, not Polish, but not 
German.  Not like in Lodz.  We  we
re able to go in the street and 
there was a curfew, that already 
didn't scare us, but we were not
 -- it was bad.  We knew we were
 in trouble, but when you're 
home less, you're already a displaced person in 
the worst way, and you are an illegal being.  You 
don't belong to this world.  God didn't mean you to
 be existing here.  The sentence, we felt the 
sentence already.  So, now me  a
nd my brother were delegated by Father.  Now, in the meanti me  
it gets cold.  We are getting into
 the deep winter and Poland is 
very cold in the winter.  The 
climate is different.  It's a gorgeous climate, but
 it's very cold and lots of snow.  How do you get 
back?   You cannot go by train.  You cannot go by 
public transportation.  Y
ou're Jewish.  Nothing 
is for you.  We couldn't find the horse that brought
 us here.  The guy who 
did it, but there was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
9 
 
pole already available, you know these things de
velop like black ma rketing, who bought tickets.  
In other words he would go to the station and buy a 
train ticket, two train tickets for us.  It seems 
that now we're fine.  We  have tickets, all right, bu
t we are still Jewish.  The tickets don't  say that 
we'r e not Jewish, so we are taking a tremendous ch
ance.  At least we can 
get into the train now, 
but the train is only with German
s and Poles.  Not only Germans, and a Jew to be in this, it's 
illegal.  They don't have to sentence you, they ca
n just shoot you or kick you out while the train 
runs.  It was a long voyage, and we ma de it home, a
nd to describe how it was, at one station they 
recognized us and they chased us
, me  and my brother, but I was 
then 17 and my br other was 23, 
no 27.  He was ten years older than me , my olde
st brothe r.  So, we were younger, and I will 
never understand in Hebrew they say Yad Elokim 
in 01:30:00  Hebrew,  that means God's hand 
must have been watching over us.  The Germans 
were chasing us across the railroad tracks in 

deep snow with Germa n Shepherds and they didn't catch us. 

 
 
End of Tape 1 

Tape 2 

 
A. We were trying to ma ke our way back to the 
city of Lodz in search of our mother.  We  
still do not (know what) happen(ed) to her, where 
she is.  One of our brothers which I probably 
did not inject before, rema ined behind.  My fa
ther would not take everybody.  He rema ined 
behind just in case to be with Mother or for Mo
ther.  So, we finally ma de it there, me  and my 
older brother.  It took days and nights.  We  
came  there so to say, finally, safely.  Our other 
brother was there.  By during that time he wasable to find out for mone y through people like in 
that particular prison who would bring out info
rmation.  You know, everything is money.  Also, 
he was able then that he knew 
already to send in a little food 
to mother.  He found out that 
mother was in prison without a sentence and was al
ready three months and there she was, but at 

least we know that she is in pris
on.  Re me mber I said before it's s till cold winter.  She had no set 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
10 
 
sentence.  We didn't know that 
she's comi ng home  at a certain 
date where we can go there and 
receive her.  So, again, me , being that I was th
e best German speaker 
in the house or learned 
German in s c hool -- and also because of my age.  
We also had still that we lured ourselves with 
the impression that they wouldn't hurt a woma n 
or they wouldn't  hurt the young boy.  They'r e 
just out for the real Jews.  So, I was the one w
ho every morning went in front of the prison across 
the street from the prison.  The city wa s almost 
already clean of Jews.  I stood there.  I asked 
myself very often, I wore a coat, I wore a hat,
 maybe it was earmuffs or the earmuffs came from 
the hat, how I lasted a whole freezing day, day in and day out with my eyes glued on the ma in 
door, the gate of the prison hoping that Mother 
will come  out.  If we knew the sent ence, we 
would only have to go there or wait until she come
s.  We didn't know that.  This took maybe a 
month or six weeks.  I really don't know, but da
y after day.  Nothing to eat.  God forbid, not a 
little warm c offee or water because the surroundings
 was already German.  I didn't have a chance 
to go to a door and knock and say give me  a drinkof water or ma ybe hot coffee.  How I survived 

it, just like most of the things are unexplai
nable and one day me  sta
nding there like an idiot 
watching if Mommy come s out, I co
me  home  Mommy is home .  They let her out the back door.  
Half of her was left, ma ybe less.  Three months.  Now you reme mber why she was there.  She 

went with the receipt to be paid for what they co
nfiscated all our businesses.  So instead of that, 
they stuck her in prison without a sentence.  Fi
nally, we had Mother.  So now, the family is 
divided.  Three of us, me, my brother and the on
e that was left behind to wait for mot her and 
Mother are here.  Father and th
e rest of the family are there.
  How do you bring this thing 
together now.  Where is it better 
to be?   Should we go there?  Should they come  here.  The first 
decision was that we should try to get Father 
back to Mother.  To go into detail how you 
accomplish a thing like that will be just -- I la
ck some ti me s the expressi ons, getting into 
for malities.  We got Father back, by horse
 and buggy some how through payments, through 
monies, through smuggling.  You had to smuggle fr
om Warsaw to Lodz, because it was a border 
already.  The border was in Kolushki.  So, finally, th
e family is getting to be
 together.  Father is 
back, but the other two brothers, 
the sister and the baby, rema ined in Wa rsaw.  We 'r e  talking not

still about 1940.  This is 1940 because Mother we
nt with this receipt 
in 1939.  She came out it 
was already 1940, the very beginnin
g of it, the winter of 1940.  So, part of the family rema ins 
stuck there and we are stuck here.  We neverheard of them again.  
The only thing that came 
through was this picture once in the ma il, in 1941.  
So, we were lucky.  That was the last sign of 
their life. 
Q. This is a pictur
e of your brother? 
A. Of my brother, yes.  This is my brother. 
 We  were like twins, because we were the two 
youngest in the family.  Show it please.  Show my 
brother.  But let me  tell you the story of the 
pictur e.  See, if he can get the pi ece -- you see 
that.  Should I tell the story of the picture? 
Q. Well, I think you should continue on with the story? 

A. So, now we are in Lodz.  It was not yet a 
Ghetto.  It was not yet 
a Ghetto, and the other 
part of the fa mily is in Warsaw. 

Q. Could you communicate? 

A. In the beginning there was ma il.  No telephone, no thing like that.  There was ma il for a 

while, yes, that's how this arrived.  For a very 
short time there was a normal mail connection.  No 
other connection.  Good question.  As
 I said, I promised to
 tell the truth so instead of saying there 
was no ma il, there was ma il, quite
 a long time.  Where are we  now?   Wh at do you want to know? 
Q. Your father and part of y
our fa mily returned to Lodz? 
A. So, now Lodz started developing and developi
ng and setting in motion the Ghetto, in '41.  
In '40 it was closed.  They started in '40, but wh
en the fences were created and the Ghetto was 
locked that was '41.  And if I'm a little off on th
e dates, you'll have to forgive me because I didn't 
have a calendar.  I didn't like t
oday do everything on a calendar and I didn't  write a diary.  So, 
dates mi ght be -- not mi ght be, will be, not corr ect.
  At the time we still had three of them there, 

and then one returned.  His son, who is the lawy
er now, through him I got 
to write this to the 
museum to begin with.  Two lives start, ther
e are there and we are here and some how it was 
considered a plus rather than a mi nus because the 
family is divi ded.  If one wouldn't survive, if 
Lodz will not survive, Warsaw will survive.  
Beca use we coul d have re united ourselve s by the

very primitive ways of communication as Father cam
e as my  other brother came.  All of the rest 
could have come , too, but it was more logical to 
02:09:00  have it divided.  You reme mber in the 
Bible when Jacob divided his rich
es so if he's caught by his brot
her Esau they all shouldn't get 
lost.  That's  how we did it.  Father decided to 
already have an apartment there.  Sist er was the 
houselady, the baby was growing.  God knows how 
old the baby was when it disappeared.  We  
don't know.  That's  how the situation 
is now, or established itself to 
that.  We were here and they 
were there.  Until the Ghetto st arted closing, and 
all the new chapter of livi ng in a Ghetto, seeing 
the creation of it and all true to life in the Ghetto. 
Q. Can you tell me  how your da
ily life was.  How things --? 
A. Daily life in Ghetto depending on wh
at the Germans had in store for us. 
Q. I'm sorry, first of all te
ll me  how you got to the Gh
etto.  We re you in the same  
neighborhood? 

A. We happened to live -- and I answered it 
to you before, in the Jewish neighborhood.  The 
very Jewish neighborhood.  As a ma tter of fact
, I have there a pictur
e of the synagogue which 
was destroyed which was on our street.  The Ge
rmans dyna mited the synagogue.  The night that 
I was sleeping in my sister's house when she still ha
d her apartment, that's 
how early they did it.  
They laid around dynamite for days or weeks be
cause a little before that, they dynamited the 
Polish heroes monument, you call it Kosciusko, and 
then they drove over with a tank and they 
put a chain on his neck and they pulled him down. 
 Then they destroyed the synagogue, and why 
to hell they needed an excuse, they needed 
excuses for nothing, they 
said because the Jews 
destroyed the monument of Kosciusko, so th
e Poles dynamited in revenge the synagogue.  
Ridiculous.  So, then they started forming the Gh
etto.  They just chased
 section by section into 
the territory, and you had to find yourself a place wh
ere to get into.  In other words, we took in 
two fa milies.  Apartments at home weren't as big as here.  Ours was a two bedroom apartment.  

By today's standard, it would be one bedroom an
d one big salon, what you called with beautiful 
furniture, in case like ours, because we  were 
on the well to do side.  Now, every room was a 

room for another family to live.  So, we got a
ll squeezed in.  The Ghetto became an Arbeitslager 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
13 
 
so to say.  It's  the best I can describe it.  Not a complete concentration camp, which actually it is 
recognized as because it has fence.  It was high 
fence all around with guards.  The signs, where 
they had the few gates of entries, I don't know 
if anybody ever told you th
at what the sign said 
"Wohngebiet der Juden", (it) means that's wher
e the Jews live, "Betreten verboten",_ it's 
forbidden to get in. "Seuchengefahr", it's danger 
of the plague.  Those were the signs.  So, we 
start forming factories of all ki
nds.  My brother in law which I me ntioned before, was one of the 
top millinery producers before the wa r.  The whol e family.  So, he founded we called a resort, a 

factory, a place to work.  We  had 500 people working.  We  ma de 02:12:))  flour -- all for the 
Germans.  I n other words, everyday German tr
ucks would come  into the Ghetto and pick up 
productions of all kinds.  Shoes,
 clothing, even uniforms, mi l itary uniforms -- and here I'll tell 
you right away with connection my brother-in-law. 
 So, that's why I worked in a millinery shop 

which had 500 wome n a nd me n working.  We  made th
e most beautiful things for the Germans.  
Trimmi ngs and flowers and earrings and hats 
for the German population.  Other people ma de 
shoes.  My brother worked in a shoe factory 
because we were from shoes.  Whatever anybody 
was able to contribute to a factory, did, because
 ot herwise we didn't get soup.  If you did not 
work you didn't get your ration to begin with, but
 if you worked, you also get a soup.  The soup 
consisted of some  water with some  dirt in it, 
but it was very important to have it.  Everybody 

worked because what else?   You couldn't go on 
the street, they would shoot you.  You had to 
work.   

Q. What age people worked?  What age range were the workers? 

A. Good question.  You led me  into this horrible 
scene.  What did I leave out before, what I 
always leave out.  Starting from 12 years, in Ma
y of '42, I don't know if you ever heard this one, 
I'm jumping over a lot now because you led me into it.  Announcements came out -- it was a 

beautiful sunny day and I was on my way home  fr
om work, because we had a home and a place 
to work.  If the home had ten people instead of 
two people, or if the home was cold or without 
water or without facilities, but that was the 
pl ace where you went to sleep over.  On the way 
home there was announcement.  Wh at do you ca
ll what you call when you put announcements 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

on the walls.  There's an English word for it. 
 Mother's  should prepare children up to ten years 
old in front of the building to be picked up 
by trucks because they are unproductive.  This 
answers your question, and they don'
t earn their ration.  I always te
ll the way I was 
tortured, but I 
never leave out in conjunction with this, this sc
ene.  I think of all the atrocities, and everybody 
knows that there is piles of shoes in Auschwitz a
nd everywhere else, but to be present when this 
announceme nt came up, when I walked into the garden
 of my building where we live and I seen 
mother's  tearing the skin off their flesh.  They ha
d to prepare their children for next day to be 
given away.  Now, what could be a bi gger crime th
an that?  All the crimes
 I will tell you about, 
or I will not tell you about, all of
 them together in my judgment a
nd I always feel it that way, if I 
would be able to come  in front of the Unite
d Nations and I would tell this story only.  The 
following day, trucks were comi ng down the street.  
Me and my brother, the father of Mark, the 
lawyer, were on the roof top.  We made it to the r
oof top for two reasons.  One, we wanted to see 
what was going on better, but ma inly because we we
re afraid to be in the building because the 

mother's just didn't deliver the 
children on a silver platter.  The Germans had to break in doors, 
and they did.  These "Herrenvolkz", these proud bast
ards, sorry if I have to call them that, were 

going door to door breaking in the 
doors with the 
carabins, grabbed the children and throw them 
on trucks.  We seen it from the roof top with my  
brother.  Isn't that hear
tbreaking.  02:18:00  Can 
this ever come  out of your mi nd?   Can this be
 forgiven?   Moses was taken out from t he water, 
right?  But she put him on at least some thing toswi m.  Here, they threw them on the trucks and 

ma ny ti me s they tear them in 
half.  Never heard it?   Ever
ybody knows where these children 
went?   They went to death.  So, usually I tell 
my own torture that I went through once.  I know 
that we'r e leaving out a lot.  We 'r e skipping a lot 
or we'd have to be here forever.  1942 again.  
I'm 19 years old.  My father was summoned to 
the Kripo. Kripo is the acronym for Cr iminal 
Police because we were big criminals.  As a ma
tter of fact, when I was in Germany 16 months 
ago, about my case, and I at once opened the pape
r and it says Kripo, I thought I'm going to faint 

there si tting there because  I didn't see this word since then.  The Kripo was the place in the 

chancellory of the nicest church
 in the neighborhood and this 
church fell into the neighborhood 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

of the Ghetto.  So, there was no use for the chur
ch as a religious place, so the Germans ma de 
their warehouse out of the gorgeous
 church.  A block big ma gnificent church.  I'll never forget 
that because it was only a block, two blocks fr
om me  where I live, where I went everyday 
passed.  They ma de this into a warehouse for 
the Schmattes, for the belongings of the poor, 
already worn down Jews.  So, the church becam
e a warehouse with that stinking stuff.  The 
chancellory which was across the st
reet turned into a 
torture house, and that's  where we were 
tortur ed ten days, and I will describe you only the to
rtures.  Father was called the 16th of April.  
See how I reme mber.  You asked before if we had money.  They went by that.  They went by the 
status of the person, figuring th
at Father was a businessman, he must have hidden money and 
what they wanted was very simply, money, diamonds, brilliants and dollars.  The list was like 

this.  So, Father was in the day before, summ
oned.  Now, you know whe n you prepared yourself 
to go there that you're going to be tortured a
nd you don't know how long.  So, what we did we 
dressed ourselves in a 
lot of underwear, a lot of
 upperwear that when they beat you, it should 
help.  It doesn't  help, but you do your best.  Mo
ther sent her husband and now she sends her 
sons.  The next day, the 17th, we were summone d, th
e three of us.  We  had to stand like walked 
up three flights, stand in the little foyer, the 
balcony when they called down the first one, there 

was more people than us.  First they search
ed us and took everything out from us, you know, 

because now we are lega l prisoners.  By coincide nce a small little pe ncil, and I don't know why I 

had it there.  It was there, and they didn't find it.
  I used it then to ma rk on the bunk in the cell 
when I came  down, the dates and the day, otherwise 
I wouldn't even know what it is.  We had to 
listen to the screams of the other ones so my ol
de r brother was done 02:21:00  first.  The screams 
were terrible.  Then they threw him down the stairs
 like a ball, and they put him into a cell.  We 
didn't know where he was going.  Next came the othe
r one.  They took it by age, and then came 
me.  When I came into the other room, there was a German sitting on ki tty-cornered desk, and he 

had laying strings(straps?)_on the counter.  Theother German was sitting behind -- I am there 

now.  He was having a br eakfast.  It turned my 
Ki shkes, because we didn't smell an egg for two 
years now.  And there he sits behind the typewr
iter consuming an egg breakfast and smells up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

the whole house with it.  The first one behind the de
sk, he was the first one 
talking to me , he says 
you are the youngest so you better be 
the smartest.  You heard what 
happened to the others, so if 
you want to be smart, talk.  We  didn't talk, becau
se by then there wasn't  anything to talk about.  
Because the answer to that is
 if you already went  to Wa rsaw, the money already became 
worthless.  That's just God forbid some thing ha
ppens here the dollar lose
s its value, everything 
became black marketing, and if there was anything
 little left, how could 
you give it to him.  
Anyway, this is only besides the point, and as I di
dn't talk, now this I considered the only heroic 
thing that I did through the war because my father 
and the three of us ma de up not to talk.  So, 
the fact that we lasted 
and I didn't talk, I considered this wa
s the only heroic th
ing, if anything.  
Anyway, wi th a wink of his head, he was a hunc
h back, you must have heard of him in your 
interviews.  Suter was his name , a Volksdeutsch,  called the ot her guy whose name  was Schmitt.  
This guy was a real German, full Aryan, tall and 
blonde.  Told me  to lay down on the floor belly 
down, ass high.  He showed me  exactly how to 
do it, but he had canes hanging on the wall or on 
the closet side.  I had to pick my cane and he 
started measuring out.  He tells me  you're going to 
get 50.  You reme mber the Singapore story with Mi
chaels.  He was getting 
six but the President 
intervened for four and a hospital room was prepar
ed for him.  He said you're going to get 50 and 
he starts measuring out and I scream.  He polite
ly stands and talks down to me , he says, would 
you please not scream.  I can't  hear you screaming.  I 
can't  take it.  Go down again.  He gives it to 
me  again, and I scream.  He says, see I forgot
 to tell you.  Bite your fingers so you wouldn't 
scream.  I go down again, he measures out and I sc
ream.  Again, he gives 
me  advice.  He says, 
you know you're hurting yourself, because ever
y time you go down again, you have to start 
counting from the beginning so don't scream.  
Go down, bite your fingers, count.  02:25:30  How 
do you count while you bite your fingers?   The sadism
 of it is what I'm trying to point out.  I 
don't know how ma ny I counted.  I don't know how 
ma ny I received.  Enough to find myself in a 
dark alley in the chancellory on 
the top floor in a flood of blood.  If you want to touch here you'll 
feel where the blood is comi ng out.  I had them t
ouch it in court last year.  Last week it was 
bleeding a little bit.  I said to
 my wife, it's bleeding.  How coul
d a nation become  so murderous?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

My father died only a few months later, Nove
mb er 27, which was -- he never recovered.  When 
we got out of there after ten days, -- I'll tell 
you one more thing.  We  couldn't sit, we couldn't 
walk, we couldn't lay down.  Re me mber I said I ha
d a little pencil.  When I got down to the cell 
then they put me  to a cell.  One of my cousin
s wa s already there too, a
nd an uncle of mi ne was 
there too. 
Q. In the same  cell? 

A. My cousin was in the same  cell, my uncle wa
s not.  I heard one of my
 brothers cry in the 
next cell.  They broke his arm, and there was 
a doctor, I reme mber his name , Doctor Gilbert, 

who was also in prison there and he tried to he
lp him.  The guard opene
d the door an shoot him 
for trying to help my brother.  This scene is also
 of sadism.  I was laying on the top bunk.  I just 
crawled up there.  There was no f
acilities in the thing, 
just a pail, but no wa
ter no nothing.  They 
gave us one little bowl of some thing like soup, once a day. 

Q. Was it crowded? 

A. Depending on how ma ny Jews they got in th
at day.  They didn't go by reservation.  One 
time I was listening  through the bars.  There wa
s small window with bars.  They ma de a prison 

out of it.  Out of the church they ma de a pris
on.  We  could have recognized the hearse, because 
the hearse those days didn't  have at home , have air balloons, air wheels but steel wheels, and at 

home , the streets were not yet paved, not all of th
em.  The main street was, but most of the city 
still had cobblestones.  At once 
I hear the hearse comi ng in.  S
o, I figured it possibly could be 
one of my brothers or my father so I looked 
out, laying looking down and they schlepped down a 
body, a corpse, and they put him into the caske
t and then a few Ger mans came out from the 
02:29:00  chancellory.  Before they 
closed the casket they want to
 take pictures with the body for 
souvenirs.  Now, being on the team of hearse
.  Hearses did not pick up one body.  When my 

father passed away, and we put him in the caske
t, they put another body on top of him and then 
more on top, and on top of the roof too, and 
you couldn't go to the cemetery, because it was 
during the day you're supposed to be at work.  We
, the three of us s muggled ourselves, we ma de

our way to the cemetery.  Luckily there was a ne
ighbor in the next build
ing from befor e  the 
Ghetto, who was a grave digger.

By coincidence a neighbor from the next buildin
g from wher e we lived all those years, because 
we lived in the Ghetto territory all our life.  
So, we knew more people th
an those that came in.  
So, this person next door, he was out of professi
on, a grave digger.  So, when we came out of the 
cemetery and he already knew that Fa ther died in 
the house, so he kept an eye on it.  When they 
started piling up the corpses, he watched for us 
our father.  So, when we came there he showed 
us he was laying already on a pile of bodies.  But 
some how he was able to ma nage that he should 
be the outside corpse and he helped us pull 
him out, pulled(?) the body(
?) and brought it to the 
grave.  He had a grave dug and we helped him 
finish it.  When my wife was once in Poland, I 
couldn't go, '46 from Sweden she went there --- oh I have here the monume nts -- she was able to 
put up monume nts for he r father and for my fath
er.  Her father was killed in the Krypo too 
because hi s name  was Grinspan.  You've heard 
of the Grinspan story.  They called all the 

Grinspans one day.  Her father -- the same  year.  
Her father and her oldest brother died within a 
week.  Families, whole fa milies were dying within a day because everybody was so worn 

physically and me ntally that if one 
died, out of grief, the others ju
st fell in line the same  day and 
died, too.  It happened.  It's  not
 as a rule, but it happened.  You'
re screaming somebody died and 
then you heard the husband died, the daughter di
ed, everybody the same  day.  So, life in the 
Ghetto.  It was a work camp.  You went to wor
k.  You got a ration of food which was very, very, 
very little because people were dying from
 hunger.  If you worked you got soup, and if you 
worked better they would reward you with another l
ittle soup.  They were out more to get the last 
breath out of you.  They fed you enough that they
 should get the production out of you, but for 
sure you should die.  You should not survive. 

Q. Was there any way to get extra 
food or different kinds of food? 
A. Absolutely not.  There was a black ma
rket developed which is a human thing, 
everywhere, if it's Russia or even the United States
.  A black ma rket.  I earned -- they paid us 
with Ghetto money.  See, I have some of it here. 
 They printed Ghetto mo ney.  It was like a little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
20 
 
governme nt, police, everything was a self ruled 
thing.  So, I earned fo
r my work 15 marks a 
week.  Bread on the black ma rket wa
s 500 ma rks.  It was ridiculous. 
Q. Was anybody able to steal outside 
of the Ghetto and bring stuff in?  
A. There was ma ybe s mall incidents like that 
but it shouldn't even be me ntioned as a fact 
because no, no, absolutely not.  There was stealing going on from one another.  Let's say if 

some body worked in a bakery.  He would definitely
 be able to help hims elf to a bread.  If 
somebody worked at the vegetabl e place.  Home vegeta
bl es were kept outside.  Now, that's very 
interesting,too.  At once we would see on the ma in 
road, like here, let's say 95.  The main road to 
Warsaw through Lodz was cut through the Ghetto. 
 You see it on last week's  movie.  It was 
fenced off.  So, what was I saying?  Oh, yes.
  So, at once you'd be able to see some thing 
wonderful is happening to the ma in road, loads 
of wagons, loads of vegetables are comi ng into 
Ghetto so we'll get a ration.  You know where they 
kept them?   On the outsi
de in the winter and 
when we got them they were all sme lled alrea
dy.  They were frozen when we brought them 
home most of the time.  Some times we were lu
cky to get potatoes that we re useable.  Now, 
potato shells was a very big thing, because in 
the kitchens where they cooked soup for the 
workers, ma ss soup, they shelled, and they had 
the shells, the potato shells.  You needed a 
doctor's prescription for a pound or 
half of pound of that stuff to have potato.  Now, when you 
say a doctor, you mi ght ask yourself were there doct
ors?   Yes, there were doctors.  There was no 
me dicine.  The doctors we re there prisoners like ourselves.  Comi ng back to my brother-in-law.  

He suffered on hemorrhoids and at  that time  this
 place was still a hospital not far from where we 
lived.  Once the Germans decided that it was a very
 new big building that th
is hospital they want 
to change into a factory for unifor ms for the army. 
 So, they had a very simple way of getting rid 
of the sick.  They drove up with open trucks on 
the sidewalks.  They threw the sick out through 
the windows, and they knew how ma ny they needed
 to have.  The Germans are very orderly.  
They had a famous saying "In Ordnung muss die We
lt zugunde gehen", that if they'll bring down 
the world to ashes, but it will be
 done orderly.  If anybody escaped through a side door or a si de 
stairway, they counted everybody who they got on th
e trucks half dead already or broken bones.

If the numbe r didn't ma tch to what they expected
, how ma ny s i ck will be in the hospital, the 
"Aelteste der Juden", which means the oldest of
 the Jews who was in charge, had to produce 
other Jews to fill in the number
s.  It is == how can anybody invent
 a thing like that.  If I would 
invent it, you should go a
nd throw me out the balcony. 
Q. Who was in charge of everything? 
A. InGhetto? 

Q. Yes. 

A. There was a committee with an Aeltesterr. 
 His name  was Rumkow
sky.  You must have 
heard of this name  already.  He was killed, 
too, at the end in Auschwitz.  They created a 
committee.  We had police.  We  had fireme n.  
We had this hospital, ma ybe one more.  We  had 
doctors because there were
 doctors, but they were not officially doctors.  They tried to help you, 
but they had no me dications for you.  There was no such thing. 

Q. But all these, the committee and the police were all Jewish? 

A. OnlyJewish. 

Q. Were those good jobs? 

A. If this was a better job, yes, it definitely 
was a better job because they were out the whole 
night.  They were able to steal.
  I call it by the name steal.  Actually we di dn't call it st eal but 
organize some thing for themselves.  Yes, it was 
a better job.  You coul
d help yourself a little 
better.  It also had its ba d sides to it, because
 you had to do things that the Germans wa nted you 
to do like to round up people.  You had to do that. 
 I wouldn't call this a 
better job, because when 
it came to being, they only took into the police 
boys that had high school
 education.  So, I was 
one of them that would be eligible.  My father 
should rest  in peace, not my son.  You will not.  I 
wanted to go there.  You get an extra piece ofbread.  You can even bring home  and extra pi ece 

of bread to the house.  But my father was t
oo honorable.  He said not my son. That's  afact. 
Q. What was the general attitude towards th
e police and the Jewish council.  Were they 
corrupt.  Did the take adva
ntage of their situation? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
22 
 
A. Well, it would be not natural if in a crisis
 like that some  people wouldn't take advantage 
of their position.  They were not saints.  There 
was a crisis that had ne
ver been in history and 
they had a chance to ma ybe grab an extra pi ece of bread or help some body in his family not 
being deported because he  had the chance to do it
.  So, it was a bad tast e, and here again my 
03:10:00  father didn't want me  to have the extr
a piece of bread or the ex
tra better chance, and 
there were more like me  who didn't go, but not a
ll that went, were bad.  They didn't go there 
because they wanted to be policemen
 or they wanted to be in this situation.  They went there for 
the piece of extra bread or little different
 treatme nt.  The end was the same anyway. 
Q. So, the other people really didn't resent them? 

A. No.  No, a little bit ye s, mostly
 not.  I mean this was it.  This was part of this life .  There 
is resentme nts.  Let's say 03:11:00  some body di
d do some thing bad, transgress.  It couldn't 
happen not.  The situation was so tight and so ba
d.  Now, I am not one of them and I am not 
sitting here to excuse them, because there were
 transgressions.  There definitely were, but I 
blame it on the enemy.  I said just enemy.  We 
were not enemies of Germany.  Jews  were the 
best citizens of Ger many for hundreds of God kn
ows how ma ny years.  We didn't carry weapons 

against Germany.  We didn't revolt.  They just
 came on us, I s till don't know why.  It was just 
anti-semitic Nazistic hate.  Now, how could 80 m
illion people, and my teacher makes sure if you 
can read hi s writing to put the number of 80 million 
because  he was afraid then that they'll try to 

have a white wash, good Germans and bad Germans.  
I would be too strict saying that there were 
none good ones.  There must have been some .  80 
million is a lot, but we have seen the German 
people in action.  The devotion to sadism.  The 
devotion to their Fuehrer was above everything. 
They commi tted the worst crimes in huma n hi
story with devotion.  It's  03:12:40  endless. 
Q. Do the Germans come  i nto the Ghetto or not? 

A. No, reme mber I me ntioned before headquarters.
  At one intersection they turned this in -- 
and also the entrances, there they had offices, ba
rracks, I would think it 
was barracks.  Officers 
with the Germans and there was the contact 
with the Germans and the Jewish body, you know.  
Also, all the transports and deliveries out and in
 same  through there.  When I said, I think I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
23 
 
me ntioned before, this incident that my mother se
nt me  -- no I described it there.  We  had to pass 
this headquarters and we could have
 gotten killed, but this
 was a separate incident.  That's  what it 
was.  You see, it was one place.  My wife had wo
rked in an office which you call the registry, so 
to say, and I don't even know what purpose this had, 
but in a back room they were saving historic 
diaries of the days for later.  
It happened to be an ex-lawyer fr
om the city of Lodz who was in 
charge of this.  If anybody could have done some thing, he would, but it was very little chance to 

do anything.  

Q. Was there any semblance of nor ma l life going on in the Ghetto? 

A. Nor mal life you probably mean fa mi ly life, nor
ma l life, yes, if you can call this norma l.  
You had an address and you had a room and you ha
d a ma ttress or a bed.  Most of the time, a 
few people were sleeping on one ma ttress be
cause there was no ma
ttress for everybody.  
Definitely not.  There we re wife's and me n's -- 
you're probably leading to sex.  There were a few 

births happen, very, very few.  That means they did have intercourse, but 
the funniest thing, if it 
is funny, when we came to Sachsenhausen or rath
er Koenigs Wusterhausen (deny?) the German 
proud uniformed officers would go through the night 
our bunks with lamps, with lanterns to see 
if we'r e not engaging in some  kind of sex activiti
es, so fresh they were.  Le t me  tell you, it took 
months after liberation that I even 
knew that I'm stil
l a living person. 
Q. Back in the Ghetto was there any 
schools, was there cultural activities? 
A. Yes, that's a good question.  Let me  see.  Sc
hools?   For who?   One thing was, I played the 
violin si nce I was 14 years old.  As a matter of
 fact, my wife reme mbers it because we were 
school friends and she reme mbers.  I played the 
violin.  I had a girlfr
iend whose whole fa mily, 
herself, her sister her brother and her other 
brother.  The oldest 
brother led, conducted the 
orchestra.  We had a concert each week on the weekends.  On Sundays, the Germans left the 

Ghetto.  They went from the Kri
po, the criminal police like in hell. 
 On Sabbath hell is not hell.  
The ma in body -- the Jews were only in their ow
n charge one day a week.  Saturday afternoon 
through Sunday.  So, we did organize concerts a
nd my girlfriend's older brother.  You say you've 
been in Yad vaShem.  In Yad va Shem there'
s an inscri ption on one wall Milly Konsky_ will 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
24 
 
conduct a concert on this Satu
rday and ______________.  I attended every concert.  Now, when 
the Germans came in, the order immediately went 
for Jews to turn in any playing instrume nt 
naturally radios included, and I had 
to deliver  my violin to the city
 hall.  I reme mber a cousin of 
mi ne I took along with me .  I was a fraid to go my
self with my violin.  While we walked up the 
steps to deliver it, I said to him, you know what
 I'm going to do?   I'm goi ng to break it on the 
stairs.  He says, you're crazy they'r e going to ki
ll you.  He's right.  I was 
off my mi nd.  FinallyI 
brought it up to the top floor, the room was loaded
 with all kinds of instrume nts up to the ceiling.  
That was the end of music.  So, how did we ha
ve the few -- now we had two conductors before 
the war in Ghetto, Professor Ridder  and Berg
esma nn(? ) _ who conducted one week and another 
week.  This young fellow who was only 19 years old, 
Jastrowski, it is recorded in Ya s vaShem.  
I'm telling you truth, my girlfriend's older brot
her.  He was a beautiful conductor, and the 
Germans ne ver found out.  Or ma ybe  they did because
 how is it possible that they didn't ?   Maybe 
I don't reme mber how long this thing was going 
on, but we did have it.  I attended every 

rehearsal and every concert, but I did not have my 
own instrume nt.  As a ma tter of fac t  we have a 
doctor in Haifa_ who also played 
in the orchestra.  I'll tell you a 
little bit of a happy incident.  I 
had a business in New York, a retail store, lis
ten boys, and a lady once walked in there with 
another lady with two children. 
 Whe n I had children come  into the store, you know, we had 
these me tal racks in the stores, would you please 
watch the children shouldn't get hurt.  Hold on 
to them.  The lady, who was the grandmother turn
ed around to the kids and spoke to them in 
Hebrew.  Now, I still know a little He brew from
 what I learned, so I asked them wher e are you 
from?   She said we live in Haifa.  We  have a frie
nd in Haifa his name  is Doctor Fuchs, she says, 
yes he delivered the mot her and th
e children, but he was one of the 
violinists during the Ghetto.   
Q. Did going to those concerts feel good?   Wa s it a release? 

A. For some body who has a feel for music,
 for art, otherwise 
you wouldn't go.  You 
wouldn't go even to a concert if you are as safe 
as you are in New York, if you had no interest for 
it.  For me , even today, listening to music.  
You want to know how ma ny tapes I have in the 
house?   Hundreds. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
25 
 
Q. What I'm sa ying was it a sp
ecial release in the Ghetto? 
A. It was known to be, nobody squealed about it
.  I don't know how I myself should describe 
this incident that I am fr eely divulging even 
if it was some thing so good, because how could the 
Ghetto have had some thing so good.  It's a mi racle.  It's such a mi racle that it was recorded in 
Yad vaShem.  It was Professor Ridder, what a wonderful leader and the 
other one and this young 
fellow.  I cannot explain, no, how it went on. 

Q. Were there other activities?   Wa s there thea
ter?   You don't reme mber
 if there was school? 
A. There was not supposed to be children so what for school.  No, no.  The answer is no, 

absolutely no.  There were not supposed to be 
children.  Now, when they took away children up 
to ten, you reme mber that, we tried in ma ny casesto ma ke fa lse papers for children of 12, let's 

say ma ke them 14, or even 10 and make them 12, but then you couldn't open a school.  Wa it, 

wait, wait.  In the very beginning I attended scho
ol.  When they chased us into the Ghettos 
already out, we ourselves just created a school becau
se our pr ofessors came  with us.  They were 
mostly Jewish and we started at
tended the school.  That was th
e building, the same  building, but 
then became a hospital and from there when they
 threw the people out from the windows.  So, it 
was a school for a while where all school like at once I was at th
e school with my wife because 
like at  home, there was no coeducational schoo
ls.  But it lasted only a few weeks or a few 
months.  We  tried to live, but we 
didn't  know that we were forbidden 
to live.  That is the answer.  
I think I phrased it well. 

Q. What about religion?   
Were you able to observe? 
A. Well, it wouldn't be a legal thing to do, but
 let's say if some body died in a house where 
we have that sitting shiva thing, 
there would a few other people to 
help out, but was there a place 
where we prayed, Rosh Hoshana, Yom Kippur?  
 I don't think so.  I really cannot tell you. 
Q. You worked on the Sabbath? 

A. Yes, we worked six days. 

Q. So you weren't aware of holidays? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
26 
 
A. Holidays, you mean observe holidays?   
You could observe holid
ays in your house.  
Nobody could tell you that you shoul
d know that today is Shavuot
h or Passover or you didn't 
have ma tzos for Passover, you can be sure of th
at.  If you had a little piece of bread it was a 
holiday.  Now, you seen it on the Anne Frank mo vies that people were stealing bread from 

me mbers of the family.  I described a scene ther
e, I want you boys to list
en in, I described the 
scene how I wanted to bring a piece of bread to
 my Rabbi.  First let me let me  tell you what a 
rabbi meant at home.  He re when you use the word
 rabbi you mean an offi
cial rabbi.  A rabbi by 
us was a teacher because a teacher was a me lame
d, which is in Hebrew teacher, so a rabbi was 
only bestowed on a real rabbi.  He
 had the top.  He had to be sort of say in our language now, a 
licensed, an ordained rabbi.  But we called our 
Hebrew teachers, those 
that taught us religion 
also a rabbi.  And he did not have
 to be with a school, an official
.  He had a few kids that he 
taught.  In our building was a rabbi
 like that, a very prized Jew 
to who almost every one of our 
sons, my Fat her's sons had to attend because
 that was higher learning, not only reading and 
writing and arithmetic, but higher 
learning.  That was done like only 
one at a time  or two at a 
time at the rabbi's quarters which was one room
.  That was his bedroom, that was his living 
room, that was his kitchen.  A poor man, and he 
derived his livelihood out 
of some  pe ople could 
afford sent their sons like myself to him.  Wh
en the war started, not yet the Ghetto, when the 
Germans came in, hunger_ came with them.  Just 
03:35:00  as whenever 
Americans, God bless 
America, came a fter the war, hunger disappeared
.  Plenty of food by the red cross and by the 
soldiers.  You could drown yourself with food. When Ger mans came, everything dried up.  And 

there were lines for bread.  You could stay in
 line for a night.  A person like my rabbi, nobody 
could visualize, and he hims elf he wa s just dyi
ng from hunger.  And at on
ce I realized that my 
rabbi on the top floor he was livi
ng in the same  building, is dyi
ng from hunger.  For all these 
years I was looking for a chance and this is why 
I probably appreciate this
 interview so much, 
because that was the first time in 
the 50 years that I had a chance to 
describe this scene that I was 
looking for an artist for a Chagall or for some body like this organi
zation now.  I at once put my 
hands like 03:26:00  this(cupping) an
d I started walking the stairs up to my rabbi's apartment as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
27 
 
if I had something in my  hand, a piece of bread fo
r my rabbi.  I had nothing there.  I walked all 
the way to the rabbi's door which was in a dark hallway, because at home it wasn't  like here.  
When I came to the door, I started asking myself a questi
on.  If I had here a piece of bread would 
I break it down to my father, to my fa mily or 
would I eat it my self.  Because as you see in the 
Anne Frank story, people were eating their fami
l y me mbers food..  At once I had nothing, and I 
turned around I walked back and the rabbi died 
from hunger.  All this th
at you are hearing today 
ma ke up for the most cannibalistic 03:27:00  
happening and we know history and we don't deny 
history and there's book recorded.  There was plen
ty bad things happening and do happen at the 

time too.  Like Elie Wi esel was the first one to
 run to the Balkans_ to say what are you doing 
here.  Let me  give you a little break down.  Re
me mber in the Balkans in Bosnia Herzegovina 
once a bomb recently a fe w months ago and it bl ew up and killed 60 people, and the world was 

outraged.  You'll be surprised when I say rightful
ly so.  60 people to kill fro m a bomb.  I'm not 
talking about all the ot her atroci
ties that are going on now today, but
 he was there Elie Wi esel to 
tell the world that he's getting sick from it.  W
hy isn't some thing done about it.  Now, let me  give 
you a statistic now.  Six million divided by 
2,185 days come s to 3,000 a day, not 60.  Three 
thousand each day, if you have a pencil or an adding machine you can add it up. 

Q. I just want  to get back to the Ghetto. 
 Were there regular ro
und ups in the Ghetto? 
A. Oh absolutely.  These were called "A
ussiedlungen", liqui dations until the fi nal 
liquidation.  Naturally that was 
03:29:00  going on norma l.  They would grab you, they would 
announce that you should come  to a certain place 
where you will be -- but they lied.  They said 
we need people that say in another part of the co
untry or the bi ggest lie and the most sarcastic lie 
was when they came in '44 to liqui date the Ghet to they told us being th
at the Russian front if 
comi ng nearer we want to save you and take you w
ith us.  So, they liquidated whole shops with 
the things and they rea
lly were -- because they we re robb
ing.  They were robbing, but under the 
pretext that some thing wrong is comi ng.  The Russian  front is comi ng near because our side only 

the Russians could have come  because that was 
east.  The Americans came  to Nor mandy which 
was in the west.

End of Tape 3 
 

Tape 4 

 
A. How could they have undertook to fight help
less innocent people.  All right, I will leave 
out the word innocent because according to them 
we are the most guilty in the world.  But how 
can they have taken upon themselves to ma ke th
e judgment and to carry on such atrocities.   
Q. You were telling me  that there were actio
ns and deportations 04:01:00  all the time.  
Were there any rules?   W
ho got sent away first? 
A. Sick, anybody who was breaking down.  Age,
 like at one time  I al most went though 
some body t old me  if you go you will not live.  They told us that they ne ed an amount  of people 

at a certain age that they'r e a little stronge
r and healthier for work
 some where in Germany 
because at one time I worked on the Berlin autost rada,_ building the Berlin highway which was 

supposed to connect Berlin to Moscow.  I worked
 there too.  So, when they needed slave labor 
ma inly the fact when let's say some body in Germ
any was short of labor 
because after all they 
were conducting a war and their peop
le were in.  So, they would 
reach into these businesses of 
theirs, Ghettos and said at once we need a t
housand young men.  That's  how it was.  Now, who 

ma de the list had a terrible conscientious thing to
 do.  He had to deliver a 1,000 people, so he had 
to sit down and pick, and whoever he picked he 04:
02:00  had to.  See, here again there is the big 
discussi on amongst ourse lves di d they have to do it didn't they have to do it.  Are they guilty are 

they not guilty.  We ll, they were ma de to do it
.  They had no choice, because if they had an 
arsenal of weapons to say we
ll tomorrow morning we'r e going to give weapons to a thousand 
boys and we'll go out and have a little war with
 the Germans instead of sending them, there was 
no such thing.  We were locked in absolutely he
lpless.  That's how they did these liquidations.  
The liquidations were actually work things.  So, if
 they didn't take him right away to death, not 
all the time , no.  You heard of the selections, 
once they took a group out, 
they started selecting 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
29 
 
who will fa ll to the wayside, systematically.  Then
 they needed more, so they had plenty Ghettos 
so they reached into the Gh
etto and got more.  There is
 no other explanation of it. 
Q. So, when they sent people aw
ay, they still needed workers. 
A. In Ghetto.  They needed some body some wher
e ma ybe better or like Schindler himself or 
my guy, where we were.  We  also were owned by 
a slave owner like that.  Maybe he needed to 
enlarge his business.  Schindler ha
d a factory and he needed more.  
So, let's say this guy of mi ne 
or another one.  He didn't give a damn for anyt
hing else probably than his own business, but he 
was able to get instead of going to the labor or
ganization for workers, th
ey were at the front 
lines.  So that's how they used us, they used us up until death.  In other words, they didn't waste a 
bit of us.  They used us until we di ed. 

Q. Did they bring more people in 
when they were sending people out? 
A. They only brought in people when they had the full pull of it in the beginning.  Then they 

didn't bring in no more.  Where would they
 take them from.  There was no more. 
Q. Maybe from other Ghettos or other towns? 

A. We had people to begin with from al l the 
surrounding towns.  In 
other words, not every 
little town did they ma ke a Ghetto.  It would be
 bothersome for them.  They incorporated all the 
small towns around Warsaw, all the small towns ar
ound Lodz, so the Ghettos were ma inly in the 
big towns.  There was some  s mall 
Ghettos, too.  It all depended 
on this strategic productive need 
that they had.  They did what they wa
nted.  They didn't have to ask anybody.  
Q. Right.  So, there were people in th
e Lodz Ghetto from around other places? 

A. Yeah, sure.  We still ha ve  some  that we 
know now that survived just like ourselves who 
were brought in from the outside.  We  know a few of the m. 

Q. Then they just got distri
buted amongst the rest of you? 
A. Yes, they were just  thrown in there and 
the leadership had to 
place them.  And placing 
people was an easy thing.  You're going to live 
in this apartment.  You'r e  going to say no, and 
he's going to say -- there was no choices
.  You did what you were ma de to do. 
Q. Did people get along? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
30 
 
A. I wouldn't say not all the time probably.  Th
ere wasn't  too much antagonism, and then on 
the other hand, it was yes, because
 under circumstances like that 
where some  helped themselves 
better to a piece of bread.  Bread was the key word.  You could have -- 04:05:00  I didn't  come  
across myself any frictions or even that I should be
 able to tell of.  I did 
know people that worked 
in the same place as me that were getting an ex
tra soup.  The biggest envy was an extra soup.  
What else did you know?   You didn't care about your 
pants.  You didn't care 
about your jacket.  
You didn't care about your tie.  You didn't care about your car.  The ma in thing was survival, a 
piece of bread or another soup. 

Q. Were wome n treated any differently than me n? 

A. Were wome n treated different than me n?   
I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Absolutely, 
no. 

Q. How did you ma nage to avoid deportations all 
this time, for these three or four years in 
the Ghetto? 

A. That's a good question because I answered a 
mi nute ago that at one time I wanted to 
report for the deportation.  Now, let me  explain wh
at that means.  Let's say that an announcement 
come s out that the Germans need a hundred stro
ng me n or young me n.  So, the first thing that 
came to your mi nd is that it will be good there wh
ere you're going.  You'll get an extra piece of 
bread.  You'll get an extra soup so some  reporte
d "freiwillig",_ voluntaril
y.  That's what you can 
call it.  So, how one avoided all the deportations
.  Some  questions are very proper that you put 

forward and not easy to gi ve an answer to.  
Because they say if they needed 100 out of a 
thousand, only a hundred went.  Who it was --
 some ti me s you needed to know some body up 
there not to be sent out.  
Another time you needed some body in the higher echelons because we 

had a committee that should help you go. 

Q. Did you know people on the committee who helped you? 

A. No, we knew who they were every one of th
em because they were visibl e every day.  I 

personally didn't have any personal contact with
 anybody in higher places.  If I mi ght call it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
31 
 
higher places.  It was like a pris
on.  A big, big prison with some  pe
ople being a little bit more in 
charge of things than others.   
Q. So, you and most of your fa mily were there until the final liquidation? 

A. No, we lost two brothers, a sister a
nd her baby in Warsaw.  We don't know what 
happened. 

Q. But the people in Lodz, your father? 

A. No, my father diedafterth
e beating in Kripo in '42, but 04:09:00  the three of us, me  a nd 
my other two brothers, my oldest brother passed
 away two years ago, and 
my other brother, the 
father of this lawyer passed away 14 years a
go.  We, by unexplainable mi racle, and you have a 
few cases where there are sisters or  br ot
hers, we were together all the time. 
Q. So, you and your two brothers and your moth
er were still in the Ghetto at the final 
liquidation? 

A. At the final liquidation, yes. 

Q. Tell me  wha t  happened? 

A. What happened.  Then they 
announced the final liquidation. 
Q. This was when? 

A. The Ghetto got liquidated between August, 
September, October of 1944, but they needed 
a group of workers that will clean up so to say. 
 They called it clean the 
Ghetto after the people 
are gone.  What was it to clean of?   Nobody ha
d a new suit or a new diamond or a new living 
room wall piece.  For them everything was good.  
Anyway, that's what they called this.  We  
loaded that on trains.  So, there were 500 of 
us, wome n and me n.  We be came kind of chosen 
because we were there longer than the others.  Th
e Ghetto was empty.  We went out every day to 
work.  On trucks they took us to work from building to building to pick up the stuff.  It's  

ridiculous, what was there?   Br
oken up things, the Ghetto was al
ready five years old.  Then 
finally came our turn where this Beboff(? )  who owne
d us, he already owned us there, so what he 
was doing was already as a businessman or rather 
as a function to guard hims elf or hide hims elf 
from going to the Russian front because he ma kes himself us eful for the fatherland. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
32 
 
Q. For the record, why don'
t you tell me  who Beboff is? 
A. Beboff was a German, a German wh o was th
e Gauleiter, it was called.  Gauleiter means 
like Schindler was in his business.  Sc hindler wa
s actually like a gauleiter.  So was Boboff. 
Beboff was the head of our Ghetto, the German 
he ad of our Ghetto because we had a Jewish 
head.  You've heard of him, Chai m Rumkowsky, 
but Beboff was the German representative, the 
German delegate, the German appointee for this busin
ess of this Ghetto.  Then he took us with 
him and he opened this business, established this
 business of building ce
ment four by eights it 
would be today flats in Koenigs Wu sterhaus
en.  So we belonged, 
our headquarters were 
Sachsenhausen, the concentration camp was Sachse
nhausen.  They took us to Sachsenhausen.  
From there he got his group further after delo
using and after being 
there a few weeks --. 
Q. Wait you're skipping too ma ny steps here.  I wa
nt to hear about the trip when you left the 
Ghetto, how all of that came  about? 
A. They loaded us into cattle trains.  I have
 to me ntion only a little thing, a few weeks or a 
few days before they loaded us, the engineer of
 the cattle of the train was a Pollack.  Because 
you reme mb er there was movie Shoah on television 
for nine hours and it showed how the Poles 
this was their job.  He was the engineer of the tr
ain.  When we were load
ing these products that 
we were ma king on those trains he told us in 
Polish Jidski, Jews don't go, they'r e frying you in 
frying pans.  Now this is the end of '4 4, and we sa
id to ourselves is he off his mi nd?   Frying us 
on frying pans?   What's he talking about.  He's 
stupid.  He knew what he was saying because he 
came from here to there and from there back.  So
, he had to be careful telling us because the 

Germans we re around but he did anyway.  So, finally
 the liquidation came.  We were loaded into 
cattle trains, and they took off.  
No openings of any kind like you see 
on Schindler's  List.  I really 
cannot tell you how ma ny nights and how ma ny 
days because we didn't know the difference 
between day and night.  They pushed us back and b
ack until we arrived at the very big railroad 
crossing and I assume  that it was Ravensbruc
k because they took out
 the women.  The doors 
opened and outside Germans r
unning around with dogs, with German she pherds, yelling aloud 
"Frauen 'r aus",_ wome n get out.  And that's  how we
 were separated from our mother.  Then the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
33 
 
doors locked again and the train went forwar
d.  I don't know how long it took and we wound up 
in another place.  Now we knew we were in Sachsenhausen. 
Q. What was the train ride like? 

A. A cattle train filled with people like sardines
.  Not a place to turn.  No facilities of any 
kind, not even a pail.  Now, you can imagine after a while how this things smelled, and people 

were just dying, falling down, sick or dead.  That's 
how it wa s.  It was hell, hell couldn't  be that 
way.  This was worse than hell.  How long was 
it?   It could have been a week.  I don't know 

because we didn't know when it was day and when 
it was night.  We just heard trains going by 
and passing by and they pushed us from one line 
to the other and at once the door opened, we 

didn't know where we were.  We  didn't know where 
we were.  That was the only stop to get all 
the wome n out.  And when they m
eant out, they meant out.  Then 
they continued on after a while 
and not long after we wound up at another st
ation and that was our place, Sachsenburg-
Oranienburg. 

Q. Describe to me  what was 
happening when you arrived there? 
A. When we arrived at Oranienburg, the doors 
opened and a few guys were dead and a few 
others got heart attacks 
and died in fr ont of us.  One of th
e m two sons survived and came  to 
America afterwards, Jakobowski_ was their name , 
and he was one of the leaders of the Ghetto, 
too, and his father just fell dead while the door 
wa s opened and we carried him with us and he 
was cremated because they had crematoriums there too.  Then we came into the camp and there 

was big sign "Arbeit macht Frei", Work Makes Y
ou Free.  So, we realized that we were in a 
concentration camp.  There were ba rracks, full of ba
rracks, and we all got -- 
04:16:00    this was 
an established concentration camp.  As a ma tter of
 fact, the guy in charge of our barrack was a 
German.  George was his name.  He was incarcerat
ed yet fr om the beginning of Hitler's times.  
He was not bad with us.  The next barrack from 
us they had Russian prisoners.  Every morning 
they would march them.  These prisoners were 
used for breaking in new military shoes for the 
German Army.  You ne ver heard of that.  That
 was their job.  In the morning, every morning 
they got a ne w pair of shoes because  they were heavy and ha rd.  They wanted to ha ve  them for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
34 
 
the soldiers to have them broken in.  SO, they 
would ma rch a whole day and in the evening they 
came back and they gave back these shoes and 
they got other shoes the next morning.  They 
were our neighbors.  Us they were taking out to
 04:17:00  work, and I reme mber at one time we 
worked at the Autobahn, means the hi ghway from
 Moscow.  We  built that.  At one time they 
took us to like work in the fields.  At one time  
they took us out to pick potatoes.  I reme mber the 
SS ma n who was in charge of the group just 
for fun pushed one of our boys.  I knew the boy 
well, when the truck moved, behind the wheel and squashed him.  In the evening he had to report 
to Mr. Beboff.  Beboff was waiti
ng at the gate when we came back, ma rching us back, and he 
reported " He rr Gauleiter, Ich habe herausge
nomme n 125", I took out 125 and I brought back 
120, and the reaction would be "gut gemacht", we
ll done.  So, when we went out to work, we 
didn't know if we were going to come  back.  All th
is was already so part of our being that we 
didn't think of the liberation.  We  didn't  know it 
would come  until finally as this our commander 
told us that the spring song wind is bl owing in 
front of you, you will not live but pr obably orders 
came in that we had to brought
 back to Sachsenhausen. 
Q. When you were in Sachsenhausen 
initially, how long were you there? 

A. Initially, we stayed in Sachsenhausen a very
 short time, just like a passing through to the 
realcamp, ma ybe two or three 
or four weeks, no longer. 

Q. Was there a regist ration there? 

A. That's  how I got my number. 

Q. Yes, but the tape doesn't  know that's  your
 numbe r so tell me  what really happened in 
those two weeks? 

A. We got incorporated into the camp as prisoners
 of the camp.  We were
 taught all the rules 
of what goes on and while we were there we hadto witness hangings.  If there was a hanging, we 

all had to go to witn
ess it.  You know, that
 was the duty of us. 
Q. What were you thinking? 

A. What we were thinking?   I don't think we 
were thinking.  Wha t  could you think?   We  had 

hangings in Ghetto too.  In other words, why 
was some body hung in Ghetto
?   I was stealing too, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
35 
 
and I'll explain you why.  Let's say my brother, s
hould he rest in peace, he worked in a shoe 
factory, so he would bring home  a sole for a shoe. 
 For that he could have been hung.  So, if they 
caught anybody touching some body,
 taking it, stealing it, he 
was sentenced. There wa s no 
sentence, there was no court, they didn't have himin court like we have the thing now.  He was 
just hung.  They had places where to hang him.  So, and when they hung some body to s how the 

others how to behave, we had to
 go and be present at hangings. 
Q. What were the rules they taught you? 

A. I really don't...The rules were to keep your
self clean, or 04:28:30  to ma ke the bunk every 
day.  There was no rules of any particular kind th
at I can remember.  I wouldn't even want to 
reme mber if there were, but I'm sure that there we
re rules to obey.  They 
were all more like for I 
don't want to say animals because I think I mentioned once today I don't want to insult the 

kingdom of animals. 

Q. But you said they taught you -- they told 
you how it was going to work when you got in, 

I'm just wondering what they told you? 

A. They didn't give us any future.  They didn't tell us if you'll be good, you'll go home or 

you will go to the theater tomorrow or you'll have a 
piece of cake tomorrow.  We  were  wor ms as 
you walk and you step over worms.  Do you ask then the worm if he had rules.  There was rules 

that they ma de up, that they obeyed.  Oka
y, it (be)came very interesting in Koenigs 
Wusterhausen.  You reme mber I mentioned we had 
no facilities.  If we n
eeded to go out in the 
field, the only way to go out was into the field.  S
o, in the night, let's say if I reme mbe r  it vividly, 
if I needed to go out in the night, to ma ke a phys i
cal need, to piss or whatev
er else, I had first to 
report to the Wacht (guard), the 
Heftlig (prisoner) #...., that I need to go out.  04:22:00  You 
know what he did to me .  He ma de me  run ar
ound the barracks three time, not run around three 
times but "auf, auf, hinlegen", I'll never forget that
.  He played with me .  He didn't get orders to 
do that.  He just wanted to have fun.  He ma de
 me  fall down and get up.  I needed to go out, so 
he made me run around three times the barracks a
nd he had fun in the night to ma ke me  fall 
down and get up.  Exercise.  Another case, it was 
a big privilege in camp, because they had their 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
36 
 
quarters there, the commanders, those who watche
d us.  I don't know now ma ny of them, eight or 
ten, so they had a separate nice
r house where they lived and where 
they ate, but they had to go 
for their food to headquarters, to the nearby head
quarters.  It was a trem
endous break or privilege 
rather a break if you were picked.  He  would just 
go, come  on here.  He picked one of the guys to 
go with him so they put you into a wa gon like a hor
se with two wheels and there was a part on it 
to go to their kitchen to bring food for them. 
 On the way there, to the headquarters every 
German offi cer who passed by like that had the 
pleasure of spitting at 
you, kicking you, pushing 
you and the one who was in charge of us didn't 
mind.  But this was a break.  Why was  this a 

break?   When they finished eating they gave you to 
wash the pots so you were able to lick a little 
bit.  So you would agree to be kicked around goi
ng one way and the other for this big break. 

Q. You did this? 

A. I had once the privilege, only once,  otherwis
e I wouldn't be able to
 tell you how these 
proud clean, tall uniformed like th
is he kicked, he spit, he thre
w his cigarette on you.  He pushed 
you over the sidewalk.  I was doing a duty and th
e guy stood there with the commande r and just 
had fun both of them.  Where did you ever
 hear a thing like 
t ha t  i n  hi s t or y?  
Q. What about people's health at this point? 

A. Health, health what is that?   Who thought
 of health.  You me a n if you sneezed?   If you 
died, you died. 

Q. Was there disease?  Were people taken care of? 

A. Well, disease they would be afraid themselves.  Well, they always had "entlausung" 

deloused us because we didn't take showers or
 wash so they threw powder on us, "entlausung", 

and if some body would be a little bit sick, th
ey would shoot them.  There was no problem 
healing him.  

Q. You had lice?   Did you have lice on you? 

A. I just told you, yes, lice.  Sure I had lice on 
me .  I did have lice on me , so what they did, 
they would powder you only.  You didn't take a shower. 

Q. Did you ever get 
typhus or anything? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
37 
 
A. I got typhus in the Ghetto, ri
ght after crypo.  I had very mild
 case of typhus, yes.  That 
was also in another horrible, horri
ble horrible thing.  I feel so ho
rrible about it, that I am even 
ashame d, I feel bad to tell it with a
ll three of you partic
ularly those two. 
Q. Forgetus. 
A. My uncle, this is why I don't want this to come  to the public because maybe I have a 

chance now, ma ybe they'll give me  s o me thing.  My 
uncle wa s also taken in at the same  ti me  as 
us, a little later, ma ybe a week 
later because we were there ten 
days.  When we came out, I was 
laying in bed sick, my wife, my father was layi
ng in bed sick, and at 
once my oldest brother 
handed me  a  little note.  Uncle So
lomon, my na me , is dead.  How did he die?   He was taken into 
the Kripo too, and they tortured him.   I'm even 
ashame d to tell you what they did to him because 

it isn't _____________.  They tied his testicles with
 a rope.  Re me mber I told you it wa s only 
cobblestones at home.  They put him on a wagon. 
 They had a wagon with horses.  They didn't 

have a car.  If we heard that
 little horse running on the stre
et, we didn't know who was  next.  
This little horse was like the devil for us.  Th
e crypo was if you reme mber
 before, I said, only a 
block, two blocks, or one and a half blocks from where we lived, my unc le, too.  They put him 

on the wagon, and until he came threw the half of 
block, he was dead.  Blue and dead.  This you 
never heard yet. 

Q. Who saw this? 

A. Who saw this?   When they took him off when he came in the front of the building, they 

threw him out, and whoever was there, my aunt, my  other people, he was dead.  He was blue and 

dead and his testicles we
re tied with a rope. 

Q. Let's go back to where we were which was Sachsenhausen. 

A. We were talking about Koenigs Wu sterhausen
 now all the time .  From Sachsenhausen we 

were sent to work camp because Sachsenhausen 
was not a work camp.  It was a concentration 
camp and this was supposed to be a work camp.  
So, there we  were not long, from October to 
April 21, when the war started getting bad for th
em and then I said before Potsdam wa s burning 
and we were able to see Potsdam bur ning, so th
ey returned us to SAchsenhausen.  When we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
38 
 
arrived at Sachsenhausen we were going to Berlin.  Koenigs Wusterhausen was on one side of 
Berlin and Sachsenhausen on the other side.  So, we
 were seeing Berlin also in flames and pretty 

ruined.  We have seen the bombers day and night
 going that way because we were in the mi ddle, 

rather  Berlin was in the mi ddle. 

Q. How far wer e  these --? 

A. We were about ten or fifteen miles from one
 side of Berlin and the camp Sachsenhausen 
was also ten or fifteen miles the other side of 
Berlin.  When we came ba ck to Sachsenhausen, it 
was a ma d house.  Papers were flying.  Th
ey were burning papers, you know, they were 
disposing of it.  There was anarchy because when the camps were there was an order.  You know 

the famous German saying "In Ordnung muss die 
We lt zugrunde gehen", we will bring the world 

down in order.  So when we came there to Sa
chsenhausen_ we didn't know where we belonged.  
There was no barracks for us.  Nothing.  They just 
led us into the gutter, but at the gate, we had 
to line up constantly and ma rch out
 into the death march.  We didn'
t know what it was.  So, that's 
how the death ma rch 
started or became . 
 

End of Tape 4

 Tape

Q. Tell me  about this work camp, what was it like? 

A. The work camp was exactly if some body w
ould open a business of his own.  We  wer e  

building one item.  In other words, this Biboff, in order to get themselves involved with 

something that is almost military and need for 
war, because  Berlin was bombarded by then and 
there was a lot of homeless.  There was no more 
monkey business.  He came  up with this -- not 

the idea-- but he opened the busine
ss of building four by eight cemen
t plates which then he sent 
or sold to Berliners to make themselves shack
s to live in.  They were already "auf Tsures" 

themselves.  That's what he did.  In other word
s, he took advantage of the situation or if you 
want to say it was a business of 
his.  It had nothing to do with 
the German governme nt anymore.  
But we did belong to the German governme nt. 
 We did belong to Sachsenhausen.  The Shupos, 
or the soldiers that  were watc
hing us were belonging their co
mmand ca me from Sachsenhausen.  
So, that's  how it worked.  It was a whole se
t up.  As a camp how it was, we did not have 
hangings in this camp.  We did not have much
 beating in this camp.  Once in a while the 
commander here would kick you.  He could have sp
lit you in half.  We work
ed from sunrise to 
sundown.  There was no hours.  I remember like now
, at that time , it was placed on a railroad 
intersection.  So, we loaded the railroad with th
e stuff and then by then already as we were there 
a little few weeks because that already was towa
rds the end of the war, we started receiving 
German sol diers from the Russian front without noses without ears, frozen hands.  They couldn't 

even eat a piece of bread that was layi ng to them
.  So, we already have seen how they were 
getting in their behind.   Yes,
 yes, they were getting it. 
Q. What were you thinking when you saw that? 

A. We were thinking -- I think you said before
 if we ever thought -- this time  we were 
thinking, oh, it was so good.  It was good.  It didn'
t last long because then they took us to the 
march, and it became hell again. 

Q. Did it give you hope? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
40 
 
A. Yes.  That was the first time when the hope 
was me or not me  but that's their end.  Where 
did we get news from?   That should be a question 
to answer.  How did we know what date it is 
or what day it is?  We  didn't have calendars.  We
 didn't have watches.  We had nothing.  When 
the SS was having a paper and the wind blew it aw
ay, that's how we caught up with the times.  
It's interesting, yes. 
Q. Please tell me more about what th
e camp looked like, who was in charge? 
A. It was a field, a big field on the outskirts or 
on the side of this big railroad station because 

what we produced was supposed to be shipped an
d received again raw ma terial.  That was going 
on for these few weeks or these fe
w months, but we were there.  
That's all it was, a big field.  
Now, you wanted to know if the Germans knew 
about us.  Le t me  describe you.  We  were 
hungry, no question about it.  We  have seen German
 women -- because this was in the mi dst of 
them-- German women driving bi cycles, not cars.  
In the back they had loaves of bread.  It 
turned our insides.  They were having big full br
eads to eat besides ot her 
items probably that she 
took home to her family.  We  seen them.  They 
did see us, and they did see the way we looked.  
They knew that we were prisoners, that we we
re prisoners--prisoners is too fancy a name  
because we were not prisoners, sl aves.  Not even 
that.  There is no word to describe  what we 
were.  So, that describes to you wh
at it was.  It was a few barracks that we  built ourselves.  When 

we came there ther e was only one barr ack and it 
wasn't  fi nished.  So, fi rst we built our own 
barrack and this Biboff couldn't give a damn ho
w much production went out from there or what 
we built.  All for him was important that he was 
covered because he was in charge.  It was his 
business and he is helping the governme nt, the war 
effort.  He was helping the war effort and he 

enslaved us.  So, probably he must have been a 
big guy that even could get a thing like that.  Do 
you understand his position?   His position was to cove
r himself.  If he made profit or not on it 
that I don't care and I don't know, but I'm trying to
 describe you what it wa s a big empty field 
which was fenced in then, and when we came there was one barrack unfinished.  We  had to 

finish it ourselves.  It was al
ready winter comi ng.  There was one
 water we ll outside, a pump.  
That's where we in the morning we able to wash
 our faces.  We stood in 
line half naked in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
41 
 
cold and splashed our faces.  You couldn't do mo re
 than that with a l
ittle pump when you had 
500 people to go through and here you had 
to go out to commandos, it's called, work 
commandos. 
Q. The entire working camp was you 500 people from the Lodz Ghetto? 

A. Yes, that group, that group.  And we  had 
wome n amongst us too, but not together with 

us.  Also, now, if some body died, 
it was another privilege to ge
t a piece of bread if you carried 
them out.  They had the wagon on two wheels only 
and you put yourself in th
e front like a horse 
and I know a person who lives now in Europe w
ho was good at it because I couldn't do it.  Not 
everybody could.  He got an extra piece of bread to
 do that job, to carry out the dead.  The way 
he disposed of them nobody knows. 

Q. So, they sent you back to Sachsenhausenand you saw Berlin burning, that must have 

been hopeful? 

A. Because we had to go to Berlin to the unde
rground bahn-- to the subway.  As a ma tter of 
fact there were rumors that Hitler had ordered 
the underground to be floo
ded.  It was flooded, but 
right after we  passed it.  So, 
through the autobahn we came t o Sachsenhausen, but we did have 
the privilege of seeing Berlin burning. 

Q. Did you see a lot of German people on your way? 

A. We did some, yes, we did see some , but they
 could not have any c
ontact with us.  That 
mood was already hell for everybody.  That was hell came  to be.  Then at once when we came  

into Sachsenhausen, the whole thing was like anarc
hy.  As orderly as the camps were, not it's an 
anarchy. 

Q. What does that mean? 

05:09:00  A. Everybody on his own.  Papers flying, burning papers.  They'r e burning 
everything.  But they directed ev
erybody into the ma in gate out 
and we got lined up into what 
became the death ma rch.  That was the death ma rch which lasted from the 25th of April when we 

left Koenigs Wusterhausen.  In include this into
 the 2nd of May, the day of Liberation.  So, we 
ma rched for about two weeks without any provisi
ons, without any facilities.  Just ma rching, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
42 
 
ma rching, marching, and after a while people were 
tipping over to the sideways with the SS on 
the sides of us.  They did inform us, like some
 of them that they are ma rching us towards 
Hamburg because -- and it was on 
television this week-- if the Ru
ssians reach us, they will call 
us all.  They, the Germans will kill us.  If the Americans reach us, we will be their --  they will 
turn us over to Americans as a good 
gesture to save their lives.  S
o, we walked like that and we 
walked and people were tipping over and that's 
how this picture got soiled because we were 
sleeping in the mud. 

Q. The picture of your brother? 

A. This picture of my brother, yes.  I didn't 
know.  I f I knew I would stow it away because if 
any German would notice he would kill me.  Then after a while I coul dn't take it no more and I 

realized that when people lay down they give him 
a shot in the head to ma ke sure he's dead, 
finished, over.  So, we kept on ma rching, we 
kept on ma rching, and people were laying down.  
At once I started negotiating with my brothers.  Now,
 this is really something that I'll never ever  
be able to explain how th
e three of us were togeth
er all the time.  That is unexplainable.  But 
there is a few other cases like that too, in am
ongst such a big ma ss of people.  I started 
negotiating with my two brothers that I've ha
d enough, I'm going to lay 
down.  I'll tell you why 
else.  It was May, April May.  When we came to
 Sachsenhausen original
ly in October they 
bathed us, just like they did for gas chambers
 and then they threw us clothing.  We  had 

undressed, and a big guy would get a small piece of 
clothing and I got a coat it must have been 
from a dead woman of 400 pounds.  So, it became ve
ry useful  in the camp during the winter, but 

to carry it on yourself in May.  Europe has a mild 
climate.  It was killing me .  It was hot, and it 
was so big.  So, at once I said I'll throw it aw
ay, but if you throw it away they'll shoot you.  

You're not supposed -- this is not your road, 
you cannot throw -- and the 
coat doesn't  belong to 
you, a  coat, a shma tte.  It had not buttons. I re
me mber when the commander once in the morning 
said to me  "Sie haben keine Knoepfe", that I 
have no buttons.  He was worried that I have no 
Knoepfe.  Tomorrow you will have K
noepfe.  I'l l  go to Macy's  and buy Knoepfe.  So when I was 
outside working I thought what 
will I do now.  Tomorrow I will be on count down and I have no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
43 
 
Knoepfe.  So, I found a piece of wire on the floor 
and I made holes and I tied it up.  This was my 
coat, which because of this coat I wanted to gi
ve up in May because I coul dn't carry it, it was too 
hot.  So, anyway, my brother, who was the father 
of this lawyer, said to me, my na me  at home 
was Schlomik, in Polish, "I have a feeling that
 we 'r e going to freedom.  Don't do it.  Please don't 
lay down."  But by then if you lay down they di
dn't  shoot you, but they kicked you.  They didn't 
want to waste ammunition on you, so they ma de you, they forced you to walk.  In the nights, 
they dispersed us into the woods.  If you want me
 to tell you the last day 
of this ma rch which is 
liberation so my brother again, he was terr ific.  Once we were sl
eeping near a farm, in the night 
and they had some  bags with little corn.  My 
brother with his fingers ma naged to pull out a few 
pieces of corn because we  didn't eat.  When we
 marched it was five of us.  Me and my two 
brothers, one friend that went w
ith me to school together and hi
s father.  He then became  a 
doctor in America and he died of cancer.  Anyw
ay, my brother was feeding us.  Everytime he 
gave each one of us one piece to chew to exist. 
 So, one day it was the 2nd of May--better yet the 
first of May we notice the SS read
ing a newspapers. " The Fuehrer is
t tot.  It was worth living.  
Do you know what it means?   Hitler is dead.  Be
tter news we couldn't ask for.  He wa s reading, 
but they were starting losing themselves.  Without 
the Fuhrer how can they exist.  The Fuhrer is 
tot.  Now, another story, airplanes started 
flying on top over us one 
day before liberation.  
Leaflets came  down signed by Truman, Stalin and 
Churchill.  Stop the k
illing, we will keep you 
responsible.  Why did they wait so
 long.  Why did they wait why c
ouldn't they do that months or 
years before the last day?   You know how the Ge
rmans reacted to that?  They have an intuition 

of sadism like nobody else.  They threw a can ofbloodwurst-- meat into the ma sses thousands of 

people got killed because amongst them was main
ly the Russian prisoners who were a little 
stronger than us.  All these people had to grab th
at can.  Ima gine their idea that they'll throw in 
one can of meat there many people will get killed. 
 That wa s the fi rst of May.  So, now liberat ion 
day.  That's a beautiful day.  At once we reached
 a little overpass as we were marching and the 
sun shined so good.  On the overpass we couldn't 
believe ourselves there were red cross busses 
and red cross representatives andGerman officers and they were 
negotiating and talking and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
44 
 
feel that this must be a put on becau
se  this is the end of us.  They di
dn't let us cross.  It must have 
been 11:00 or 12:00, we didn't know.  We  didn't ha
ve watches, and I reme mber I was laying on 
the ground and I put my feet against a tree just to
 relax a little bit and 
I was picking grass and I 
ate and we were sitting there a
nd they were negotiating back and forth and we didn't believe that 
this is it.  At once, ma rch again, the busses get 
away and we ma rched across this overpass.  So, 
the hours in the meantime we went forward until 
we reached an intersection and there was a 
German aga i n like this showing us that we can't  
go any further than into the woods again.  Same  
thing as every day.  Dispersed into
 the woods for the night.  My br
other, this one, he was a hero, 
really.  He had a little can on him all the time , an
d as we were ma rching at the risk of being shot 
he would run over if there was mud, and he woul
d grab a can of this and that would be our 
supper in the evening, with the wo
rms and everything in it. He did it every day.  So, they moved 
us in there.  Yes, I must give
 credits to the Czechoslovakians. 
 We were marching geographically 
as Poles, and the Poles even then were anti-semitic, but at  once geographi cally we were able to 

blend ourselves into Czechoslovakia which is ne
xt on the ma p geographically, and these Czech's 

took care of us.  They watched over us.  They knewwe were Jewish that we
 are in bigger trouble 
than them.  In the evening, in the ni ght, they help
ed us get leaves together
 to ma ke a place to lay 
down.  I'm talking now about liberation day.  So, we
 did all that, and my brother had managed to 
grab a piece of supper for us, in the can of wor ms  
with everything in it, with the gr ubs, and I lay 
down on the ground like that a
nd I pushed it over, my 
can, with my foot.  There went our dinner.  
My brother got himself again -- now it's a disp
erseme nt.  Everybody lays there, all kinds of 
nationalities.  God knows how far and he went to fi
nd another pan, and he didn'
t see it.  He went.  
After a 05:18:00  long time, me a
nd my brother standing there we lost him.  At once we see a 
bundle is moving forward like a pile of some thi
ng is moving towards us.  We notice that our 
brother is comi ng and he  brought a can of food.  He
 said we don't need it no more, we are free.  
Free, will you stop saying that, we'r e 
going to get killed.  Wh ere do you get ______________ 
what do you mean we are free.  Don't you see ever
ybody is here.  And a little while later a green 
Opel car, those days with the step on the side, dr
ove in, and a Russian officer said zdrastvjete, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
45 
 
was Russian because there were ma ny Russians, so 
we started believi ng that we were free.  The 
rain st arted drizzling a little bit.  The day came to 
an end and we say to ourselves, if it's true and 
everybody starts going out to the ma in road and we
 say to ourselves, we'r e Jews.  Let's wait a 
little longer.  If it's true, we wa
ited that long, let's wait a little l
onger, but the woods were getting 
empty and also we noticed that Germans we
re kind of comi ng and mi xing amongst us and 
tearing off their epaulets and throwing their uni
forms away, t he big heroes.  At once they'r e not 
anymore heroes.  Some t hing -- we couldn't add it up. 
 Also we decided also to go out.  So as we 
went out towards the main road because we knew where we came in, the corn was already that 

high on the side of the road.  At once we notice 
a German on a horse with a column of horses 
like this.  He didn't know that it's over, so we c
ould have gotten killed.  We laid down on the side 
of the corn and they passed and we went forward.
  We came to the main road.  Americans with 
the pistols like that, like about 
every 20 or 30 feet.  We  couldn't believe it.  The Germa ns like 
this, their tanks taken and we'r e free.  I was hospi
talized ri ght after this.  Let me get to it. We 
didn't know English.  In other words, the Russian
s and the Americans(? )  came together.  So, we 
went --we came  out to the road where the American side was which was good.  The American 

boys showed like this.  We didn't know what they meant.  The Red Cross is waiting for us there.  

Until we understood what, so we were going ther
e and in the mi ddle of the road the Germans 
were already like this, pr isoners, with the tanks 
with all the machinery and we couldn't walk no 
more.  We  didn't know how far it was so we got in 
in a tank.  The soldiers helped us on the tanks 
and the Germans were leading the tanks.  I came 
up on this tank, in front where the driver was, 
was lying a bacon, a big piece of bacon.  It was 
gr een and I ate it.  I 
wound up in the hospital, 
because I got poisoned from it.  Anyway after a s
hort while of -- I didn't know right away that I 
was sick.  I didn't eat -- I mean I knew I ate ra
w bacon and after I went off that tank the whole 
thing -- the whole world is how will I use an ex
pr ession, in Hebrew it's Tohu va Bohu, like in the 
beginning God (when) created the world.  We  walk
ed, me  and my two brothers, and at once we 
noticed that on the left hand side was a white
 beautiful house and three American soldiers 
standing there.  So, we went over to them.  The 
Germans we re just walking passed like this with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
46 
 
their hands on their heads, prisone
rs.  We  went over to them and 
we started talking but we don't 
speak English.  But they were Jewish boys, so we 
were able to communicate.  They we re wild.  
The first Jew since Normandy, which was a year 
later.  The invasion of Nor mandy was a year 
before.  They took us into that house.  This was 
a German house.  They to
ok us into that house.  
They fed us, which they shouldn't have.  Then they 
put us to sleep and we  couldn't sleep in a bed.  
It was awful, it was so clean and it was so soft
.  The following day I got sick, and they had to 
take me  to the hospital.  The sold
iers took care of us all the time.  
They were stationed there.  So, 
they brought a woma n German doctor for me , and sh
e prescribed red wine for me .  Where would 
they get red wine.  It's a war zone.  The boys 
went out and told us don't you open the door to 
nobody.  When we come back we will knock with 
the carabines on the door a certain amount of 
times then you'll know it's us.  We 'r e going to look 
for red wine.  They came  back in the mi ddle 
of the night.  You're not going to drink red wine. 
 We 'r e going to bath you in it.  We  found a tug 
boat full of it.  That's  the end. That is the end 
of the hell, but then you are a displaced person and 
you have to go through a lot.  It took until July 
'45 when we went to Sweden.  We  went to 
Sweden because you reme mber when I told you my 
brother, they broke his arm, and they shot 
the doctor.  Because of my brother's state of 
health, the Red Cross picked sick ones to go to 
Sweden.  Very few, as we wondered all his time  how
 is that three of us su
rvived?   Very few were 
more than us alone, so anybody who had fa mily like two brothers, the Swedes took us alone.  

That's how we got to Sweden
 July 7, 1945, afte
r liberation. 
Q. So the Red Cross took you to Sweden? 

A. The Red Cross took us to Sweden, yes. 

Q. What happened in Sweden. 

A. In Sweden my brother was put in a hospita
l and we were camped.  It wasn't  only us.  
They took over a lot of people, and they had 
camps provided, like military barracks outside of 
Stockholm, all over Sweden.  This is a separate
 chapter.  The Swedes did us absolutely 
ma gnificent.  That's a separate in our lives is Sweden. 

Q. It must have been quite an adjustme nt? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
47 
 
A. If you want to know about Sweden, it was qui te an adjustme nt but it was so wonderful.  
They were so nice.  All right.  We  arrived in Sw
eden the 7th of July in the city of Helsingborg.  
People were on the roof tops on the ________ hanging.  
People were every where to receive us.  
Then, naturally we were sent around -- oh, it wa s July so the schools it was vacation so the 

schools were turned over for our use.  They br
ought us to the town which is called Landskroner, 

and they put us in a school.  Naturally, they 
had to put fences around.  Now, before we left 
Germany, the port of Luebeck, the Swedes took us
 over already.  We  got undressed and all we 
got -- we got sanitized because we were in ba d shape, and they gave us underwear only.  We  

lived in that underwear for two or
 three weeks in that school, becau
se they were quarantining us.  
They fenced around that school.  Swedes were only 
allowed to go to see us or to talk to us 
through the fence because they were afraid of si
ckness.  After we were through the quarantine, 
busses came.  They took us to warehouses.  By
 warehouses I mean stores, like Macy's , like 
Gi mbel's , you know.  The stores were  not available for civilians for 
that particular day.  We  had 
a list of what we need to wear.  That was af
ter the quarantine. The quarantine took two weeks, 
three weeks.  The sick ones were take n to other 
sanatariums and first they gave us three changes 
of clothing including work clothing. 
 Everything that a person needs 
that's what the Swedes did.  
I'm very fond of all of Scandinavians.  You know
 the stories of Denmark or Norway.  So, that's 
what they did.  Even Finland.  That's  how we
 wound up in Sweden and there we were camped 

for a certain while.  They taught us trades. We  we
re free people. We  were able to travel free.  
Everything fr ee. 

Q. Did you eventually get your
 own places to live there? 
A. Yes, when we started working we had an 
apartment.  We  li ved as subtenants, because 
while we were in Germany liber ated the military, 
the American Military were regi ster ing those 
that want to go to America.  So, we were on th
e list.  So, we were not eager to have our own 
apartment, but we rented an apartme nt from a w
onderful lady in a private house.  Her son was a 
classmate of Ingrid Bergman's 
first husband Aaron Lindstrom.

Q. Before you ma de it to Sweden, did you --? 

A. I see what you mean.  I was hospitalized 
in a city called Hagenau.  A small city in 
Germany, in the vicinity.  But Hagenau was also
 a prisoner's camp.  I me an, we were camped 
there just like others.  As I me ntioned before 
at one point, we were c
onsidered geographically 
Poles so they put us to this district, the Polish 
district of the camp.  The Poles started showing 
anti-semitism immediately.  We couldn't take it.  We didn't have to take it no more.  We knew 

this is the end.  We  woul d not accept that.  We  wo
uldn't stay here or we'll do something about it.  
One of our boys, who happens to be now a lawyer
 in Tel Aviv, spoke, knew English a little bit, 
like I learn languages in his school, instead of 
German, they learned English.  So, he knew 
enough English to communicate.  He went to th
e American headquarters and by coincidence the 
captain there in charge happened to be a Je
wish boy from Ne w York.  We told him what 
happened.  He immediately ordere d a truck.  It wa s an open truc
k or a bus I don't reme mber and 
he arranged to bring us to Be
rgen-Belsen.  The Poles looked what happened.  Where are you 
going Jews Jidji, where are you going?   We  didn't gi
ve a damn for them.  We were out.  That's 
how we wound up with all the ot
hers in the big camp of Berg
en-Belsem.  That's where we 
stayed. 

Q. How long were you in the hospital? 

A. In Bergen-Belsem I was since liber ation wh
ich was May.  It  was still May until July 7.  
From there we went to Sweden. 

Q. Can you tell me  about Bergen-Belsen? 

A. Well, the camps in Bergen-Belsem where we were kept  used to be a German air force 

academy.  That's where they camped us.  We  slept on beds and on floors.  The hallways were full 

of poeple, and Americans were stationed acro
ss from us.  We never knew pancakes, but we 
wanted to eat something better because what they
 gave us us was still not the best , but the 
Americans were getting delicious food, so we 
would stay there with our cans.  When t he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
49 
 
Americans threw food away, the English couldn't afford to do that.  We  grabbed it, and that's 
how we were introduced to pancakes.  Every one 
of us would sleep on a dozen pancakes.  That's  
true.  You know we were sleeping in the hallwa
ys, lined up.  We got some kind of ma ttresses, 
but everybody was grabbing pancakes.  It was so good.  It became like an item to us.  Whoever 

had more of them.  So we put them -- where could 
we have kept them all day?   We kept them in 
our beds, and that's where we slept.  And little by little, we st ar ted to develop and we were able 

to see a doctor and the fact that my brother wa
s injured, the Red Cross, the Swedes were already 
very active there helping out, so th
at's  how they took us to Sweden. 

Q. Was it crowded?   We re the conditions okay there? 

A. That question should be answ
ered it was crowded but wonde
rful.  We  were free.  We  
were free and little by little peop
le we re comi ng out of there.  Those that rema ined in Germany 
ma ny re ma i ned started working.  St
arted doing business, started go
ing to school.  I wi sh I went 
to school.  I should have gone to school becau
se I had the background, but if we would have 
rema ined there, I would have gone to school and 
I would have been today an educated person.  
But my brother had to go to Sweden. 

Q. Were the schools organized by the camp itself? 

A. No, no, no.  They went to regular German sc
hools, not schools for us.  You were able to 
attend -- you became a norma l person and anybody could have done whatever he  was able to do.  

People were out to help themselves.  For a l
ong time we lived on the me rcy of the donations, on 
the me rcy of the UNRRA.  You heard of the UN
RRA, on the  me rcy of the American Red Cross 
or the European Red Cross.  There wa s no more 
problem of not being fed.  Even dressed, even 

housed.  So if at once we  were housed and slept in
 a corridor, to us it didn't  mean anything.  It 
was wonderful.  We  were free. 

Q. How long did this euphoria over your freedom 
last?   Did people all of a sudden have to 
come to terms with their fa milies? 

A. Well, it was a very horrible time  because at once we had to se e who do we have.  Wh ere 

are they?  Where are the others?  That became the main concern.  Where are they?  What 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
50 
 
happened?   How can we  find them?   Some  picked 
themselves up and went home, if t hat's what 
you call it.  They found nothing.  We knew that 
it's no good.  A few did discover themselves and 
that's how the whole new era of life started wi
th zionism, with Israel
, with American, with 
Canada.  For once we were free to do things with
 ourselves and again, step into normal living.  
Those things don't happen overnight.  It's not easy particularly we are displaced persons.  D.P.  
We were stamped D.P..  We we
re D.P.'s, displaced persons. 
Q. Did you have any thoughts a
bout going back to Poland? 
A. No, no.  I wouldn't be able to face it.  
My wife went once from Sweden in 1946 because 
we knew -- she wanted to go to put up monume nts 
on her father and her brother and my father.  
She went for that purpose and we had already pe
ople there that did return
 so she had where to 
stay.  So, for that purpose she went.  But I couldnever have gone back.  I would never, no.  I was 

once in Belgium, in the outskirts of one of the 
city of Liege_or where(ever?) that also had 

concentration camp.  That's the only concentration 
camp I tried to go into 
after liberation because 
we were in Belgium one year 1947 from Sw
ede n.  It was a horrible thing to see. 

Q. When you were at Belsem were there efforts ma de to help people get information about 

their families? 

A. Oh, definitely, the UJA.  That's  how I f
ound my wife.  That's how my brother found his 
wife.  They were only girlfriend and 
boyfriend then. That was in Sweden.  
Q. How about Belsenm?  

A. There too, in Bergen-Belsen too.  But we 
first discovered our things in St ockholm whe r e 
the UGA had every day new lists.  And my brothe
r found his girlfriend, and she was at the other 
end of Sweden.  Sweden is long and narrow.  
It takes a night to come  from Stockholm to 
Southern Sweden.  So, I went with my brot
her o find his girlfriend.  She was only then a 
girlfriend and there was a girls camp.  Ca mps for  girls and boys.  This is a very famous story.  

One of the girls was showing pictur
es that were taken after the war 
of the girls and at one picture 
I see this is Grinspan.  She says how do you know
. I said this is my fiancee.  This is my 
girlfriend.  I love her.  She was -- but I had to
 go back up to Uppsala, the old city.  She was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
51 
 
adopted by a non-Jewish fa mily, a Christian family 
who is a very aristocratic family whose son 
was the president of the bar of
 Sweden, and the daughter was th
e president of the Library of 
Stockholm.  She was adopted there and they sent 
her to become  a nurse.  She was working as a 
nurse in a hospital.  Anyway, it was before Rosh
 Hoshana.  I sent a New Years card.  But what 
kind of New Years card?  Sweden didn't have Rosh Hoshana cards.  So, it was a Swedish small 
good new year.  I have  the card until today in my house. So, she was adopted there.  She was 60 

miles above Stockholm.  She thought that nobody re
ma ined.  So, when I found her on the list, I 

sent her this card and at once she 
knew I was there.  By then she was going out with this Swedish 
captain of the Air Force.  She was in a beautifu
l family, the Culvert fami l y.  They were a very 
aristicratic family.  But when Mrs.
 Culvert recieved this card and th
en I started writing letters she 
said to her what is this correspondence 
you're having.  We  want to know who you'r e 
corresponding with.  So, she said this is a friend fr
om home .  They said we want to me et hi m.  
They invited me  to their house and 
Mr. Culvert went out to the woods
 and killed a deer that's the 
only time in my life that I ate deer meat.  Th
ey made a dinner for us and by desert time Mr. 
Culvert took me into his library. 
 All the Swedes have librari es a
nd particul arly an aristocratic 
fa mily like that, very wealthy, but he was kind en
ough to test me  on the Bible, otherwise I would 
be lost, and I passed.  Then they
 st arted intervening with this 
girl that you see today.  Mrs. 
Culvert told her no it's not good.  It's an attr
action with this Swedish captain, you never me t 
some body else.  You thought everybody is dead.  So
me body showed up, cool it a little bit.  Let 
us get to know this boy, and they came  to
 my wedding.  We were married in Malmoe. 
Q. You started dating in the Lodz Ghetto? 

A. We knew fr om school, not the Lodz Ghett
o, school days.  We lived in the country 
together a few season, one villa next to the other. 
 I knew her brother.  Here is a picture of her 
fa mily.  She received it from an aunt in Newark
 after the war.  You will 
recognize the cute little 
thing.  I knew her since probably she was ten ye
ars old.  Last week was our 49th anniversary.  
The 24th of March. 

Q. How come  you decided to 
come  to the United States? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
52 
 
A. If you reme mber we were registered.  In
 those days, I don't know if you'll reme mber do 
you reme mb er the Berlin blockade in history,w
hen Truman was President and then again it 
looked like move me nts from the Russians.  It
 looked like a new war is shaping up and we 
decided enough is enough and some how we were 
registered and at once we  were called by the 
American consulate that if we want to it's our tur
n.  So, we decided to go.  So, just like this, we 
came with $500 in my pocket and a pregnant wife
.  So, you want to know how easy it was here?   
When I came here that was in 1949, Truman was Pr
esident and I learned a 
trade in Sweden as a 
furrier, but there was a big crises and it was alre
ady past season and I coudn't find a job.  I came  
in on 29th street to one person and he told me  
look you cannot find a job now.  Listen to me  and 
I'll help you.  I know the chief 
of personnel at Montefiore Hosp
ital in the Bronx.  She's a friend 
of mi ne.  Seven million unemployment in the co
untry.  There are lines for this job as a 
dishwasher.  Go there.  I washed dishes for thre
e months.  Nice story.  La
ter years, I was always 
in business.  We  lived in th
e country where my se cond son wa
s already born and young mothers 
always go to more experienced mothers if they 
have a problem with their child like coughing or 
sneezing.  Ta lking about little ba bies you know. So, it was on a Friday, by Friday evening I 

would come  to the country already.  My week was 
over.  By that time I was still washing dishes 

at Montefiore Hospital.  So, a 
lady another lady came over to my wife to ask her some advice 
about the child.  My David, my 
youngest son, says Ma, tell her to
 wait later Daddy is comi ng he 
works in a hospital."  He didn't say that I worked 
as a dishwasher.  He thought I'm a doctor.  He 
was a kid only. 

Q. Let me  just ask you a couple general ques
tions.  What do you think got you through all 
this?   How were you able
 to survive all this? 

A. Absolutely impossible to explain.  This que
stion is nagging us constantly.  What did I 
have better, or what abilities di d I have better
 than my other br others, and I reme mber each and 
one of them extremely well.   They were bette
r than me .  My younger brother was a much better 
student that me.  My older brother was the most
 wonderful mechanically and business like.  The 
whole fa mily, they were all worki
ng the business.  It ha
unts us.  This was the strongest question 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322  
53 
 
that you asked today.  I was only ta
lking about it a few days ago.  
It haunts us.  We  don't know.  
If you're going to tell me  God did it, I don't buy it. 
 Because if I would buy it, I would agree with 
the fate of them, no.  I don't understand.  We  don
't  understand how the three of us were together 
all the time .  Because you know why we went th
rough like that, because we were shaved.  They 
didn't know we were brothers.  We  were standi
ng one next to the other, but the mi nute they 
would know those were three brothers, they 
would shoot either th
ree or two of us. 
Q. Were there time s other than on the death ma rch where you wanted to give up? 
A. I don't reme mber such things.  No. No, because a person doesn't live only for himself.  I 

lived because I had a mother and she didn't 
have a husband now.  I lived because we had 
brothers.  I lived because I was stealing a little
 bit to support the fa mily.  You mi ght want to 
know what I was stealing.  I told you I could ha
ve been hung.  I was in charge of the supply 
room in this particular factory and at once 
trucks came in.  You know heads(? )  are sized by 
sizing, by Starch and once a delivery came in from 
the Germans with the bi
g bag of some  kind of 
a flour,  white flour, and I was in charge of it.  I 
didn't care if this is chemical or edible or not.  
What's  the difference.  If it will be poison, we'll die.  And every day I brought home in my 

pocket in paper a little bit of it and my mother 
mi xed it with pototoe skin and made it so mething 
tangible to eat.  How could I have thought of 
dying.  There was a lot of suicides.  There were 
suidices, but some how we were ma naging a little b
it, this brother, like I said before, he would 
bring home some thing stolen from 
the factory so we were able to
 sell it on the black ma rket.  

Talking about the governement, the Germans can arrest me  now for stealing from them.  At that 

time that's what it was.  I didn't consider myself 
a thief, not a bit.  I did some thing to save the 
fa mily. 

Q. Throughout this period was relig
ion important at all to you? 
A. I knew it was going to get to that.  I am raised
 in a religious home , st
rictly religious.  As a 
ma tter of fac t  I'm sure you know wha t  it means an
d I'll tell you some thing.  I was reading the 
Torah myself one week, my younger brother one wee
k, and a cousin of mi ne
 the third week in 
my grandfather's synagogue.  I taught here in America, a guy, he was just here in Fl orida

recently, to read the Torah because he was nine
 years old when the war broke out.  Then he 
became my neighbor businesswise if Suffolk, Ne
w York, so he was not ba r mitzvahed. By 
coincidence he was quarantined in Sweden with 
me  together, but we didn't  know one another.  
But he told me  you know I was quarantined in 
Urkis(?) skola, in Swedish (it) me ans a 
tradeschool in Nauskrona(??).  I sa
id I was there, but there wereso ma ny of us.  So we started 
revealing one another and tel
ling what we know what we don't know.  Once his daughter came  
into my store and says Sol, would you help my fa ther become  bar mitzvahed.  I said yes.  I have 
another story in Wa rsaw.  Anyhow, I did it and then
 he told me  after that that he wants to 
become  a real reader.  So, I said if you want to
 do it it's  very tough, but if you want to, and he 
take me and anyways we accomplished it and he is
 -- my pupil is reading the Torah every shabat 

in Suffolk Synagogue.  But some thing else, when we were in Sweden, reme mber when I told you 

about it was Rosh Hoshana and I sent a card to 
my wife, but the chief rabbi of Sweden Rabbi 
Jacobson was comi ng to the camps to organize reli
gious services for new years, Rosh Hoshana.  
One of the boys who is from Montreal and now he liv
es in  Florida.  One of the boys told he you 
know we have a guy here from my c ity, Rabbi w
ho reads the Torah.  So, Rabbi Jacobson says we 
have a ______________ here.  He came  to me  he  sa
ys you know we 'r e organizing services for 
the holiday you're going to read.  I sa id Rabbi 
I will not.  I cannot emotionally do it.  He was 
desperate.  He said  I found a __________, and I can
't  use it.  Anyway, Rabbi, it's impossible 
because when I do it, I see my home, I see my fath
er, how proud he was.  I can't  do it.  One day 
me  and my wife ran into Rabbi 
Jacobson at the Central St ation in
 Stockholm.  He had returned 
from Oslo, Norway.  He buried 70 Jewish bodies. 
 He comes over again to me .  M y wife was 
with me .  He says, Sol, whatever he called me  
then.  Will you maybe do me a favor and come to 
read in Oslo.  I said Rabbi, it doesn't matter wh
ere I cannot do it.  He was desparate.  So, he 
walked past in the st ation waiting for the trai n 
and at once he came back, I have an idea.  Will 
you teach some body if I find some body who wants to.  
I said yes.  But we were camped outside 
of Stockholm.  Every morning --
 but our transporation, everythi
ng was free.  Every mo rning we 
came to Rabbi Jacobson's house.  We  had breakfast
 there and I taught the guy how to read for the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322

holidays.  I never yet read on my
 own.  Only recently this pupil 
of mi ne had his 40th anniversary 
and we were invited and we were
 up north and he called me  over 
to show his rabbi he said see 
this is my teacher. 
Q. Today is religion important to you? 

A. I am not observant.  When it comes yis
hkor, you know what yishkor is?   On certain 

holidays we have reme mbrence of the dead.  The list 
is so long that I stay in bed and do my own 
reme mbering of whoeve r I reme mbe r  including my wi
fe 's  fa mily.  I a m afraid to say it while 
other religion is present.  To me  it's a little 
bit hypocritical.  How coul
d God have done -- as a 
ma tter of fac t  my teacher, you gentleme n didn't  
know, I have books of my  teacher the poet.  He 
was a son of a rabbi from the very famous city of
 Wilno (near), Lithuania.  At one point he says: 
" we served you all our lives, where are you? "   Ho
w could I be a believer.  If you ask me  if I 'm a 
disbeliever I wouldn't say so.  It's so tough to be
 a believer.  My father
 and my grandfather and 
we were fr om a religious home.  Six million  Jews of which 90 percent were religiously obedient 

and some thing like that could be lashed out on th
em.  When I say some thing like that you haven't 
heard nothi ng yet. You will never hear the whol
e thing.  The whole thing is a tragedy.  You 
questioned this to me  is a tragic question.  If I ha
ve to stay here and not being able to say yes or 
no, that's a tragedy.  That's  a personal tragedy. 
 I cannot say no because there lays my  father.  
That is why I cannot read, because
 I see him.  I see him how proud he was.  He ran back and 
forth to that synagogue being pr
oud his son I was only 13 when I started bar mitzva and then up 
to 17 and then his younger son, every 
three weeks.  This is why some ti mes I say our life is a very 
painful life.  We hurt, so to call us survivors,
 is wr ong.  We are victims, because a survivor 
doesn't  suffe r anymore, but we do, we do.  But go through for these ma ny hours, go through 

every day in our mi nd, every day.  There is no such 
move.  If we go to bed, if we go to wash, if 
we go to eat, if what we eat if it's  Sunday, if 
it's Saturday.  There is no such thing, and when I 
told my dear friend, neighbor Mary, let all the na
me s of all your dear children your family your 
preachers, your clergy, your teachers and you It
alian people, ve ry family mi nded people, how 
can you just ask me  to start living a normal life.
  When you lose one person, we lost one brother

before the wa r, he was 21 years old.  Life in
 our house, in our home was never the same .  My 
father was a finished person and my mother 
got sick forever.  So, now you asking somebody 
who lost the world of every thing.  Forget abou
t ma terial.  Would you believe that the Germans 
have a nerve now to accuse me that I have materi
al reasons for wanting to be paid.  Number one 
I don't want to be paid, because if they want 
to call this "Wiedergutmachung", many of us didn't 
want to accept it from the beginning, because th
at's too high priced. "Wiedergutmachung" means 
ma de good.  How do you ma ke good for that.  I don't 
know who allowed them to use this name .  
They could have found in the dictionary of th
e German language ma ny easier words to describe 
what it is than "Wiedergutmachung".   There are many cataclysms through history.  There is only 

one thing that I'm kind of grateful
 for, that they used the st rongest word in the dictionary which 
is Holocaust.  You know how ma ny 
people try to call their own thi
ngs lately when some thing is 
going on downtown where the Spanish people wanted 
to call their faith Holocaust.  That means 
that they don't grasp the scope of what this Holoca
ust was.  Because if this has to be the strongest 

expresseion is only because they di dn't  find a str
onger one.  That's exactly what my t eacher said 
and I told you before  I cannot find when he 
got me lancholy and he stopped writing and his 
friends said Yitzkhak you must write for history. 
 He says I can't find wor ds in the dictionary 
words to write. 

Q. You're teacher's name? 

A. Yitzkhak Katznelson.  There are streets name
d after him in Israel.  Then you have the 
museum.  One more thing.  I'm glad that I remi nded myself.  When I talk about Katznelson, I am 

paying homage to my parents.  Because to send 
two boys to his school was a big expense, a big 
effort.  So when I talk very mu
ch of him, all my friends know th
at and they'll know about it. If 
you boys ever go to Israel, there is a museum bu
ilt and the name it's called Lokhamei ha Ghetto-
oth (tape ends.)
