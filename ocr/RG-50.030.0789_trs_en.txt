A: My father 
Jusef
(ph) 
Henry Zu rczak 
was a teacher. He became an 
administrator, a masters™ schoolteache
r, and he was also a violinist. 
Q: And your mother? 
A: And my mother was a teacher ma
joring in mathematics and physics. 
Q: Quite unusual for a woman. 
A: Well, she had difficulties Œ 

Q: Did she? 
A: Œ with math when she started at, I 
think, the teachers™ sem Œ seminary in 
Leszno
. And she got help. 
[indecipherable] 
f Œ from another teacher, someone 
who wanted to help  her, saw that she was 
bright, but she was rather not too well. 
And it helped that she became one of the best students when  she graduated five 
years later, so Œ and she loved math, so Œ 

Q: That™s an inspiring Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ that™s an inspiring story, yeah. And 
when  you Œ so if your parents were both 
teachers, were they very 
active in the community of 
students, and Œ and school 
activities, and Œ and things
 like that? Were they Œ 
A: Yes, they were. Besides, both of my 
parents were scoutmast ers. A ctually, my 
mo ther was a scoutmaster of the young
est group, and she had only boys. Sh e

didn™t have Œ like girls very mu ch. But my
 fa Œ and my Œ my father became a Œ a 
scout when he returned to 
Poland
 in 1920 or ™22. I don™t remember Œ 
Q: Did your father fight in the first World War? 
A: No. Both of my pare
nts were born outside of 
Poland
. My father was born in 
Garnisonkirche
, and then they  moved to 
Dortmund
, upper part of 
Germany
, 
and my  mother was born in 
Helma
(ph) 
Wiesbaden
 Œ 
Q: So their Œ 

A: Œ the northwest part of 
Germany
. 
Q: Did you have German fa
mily, or German roots? 
A: No, because during the partition of 
Poland
, that part of 
Poland
 was part of 
Prussia
. So they were taken Œ my  grandparents were taken out of 
Poland
 to work, 
and my  grandmother, my  mo the
r™s parents were taken to 
Wiesbaden
 because my  
grandfather was a forester and they need ed someone to wo rk th ere. And both  he 
and my  grand Œ my  grandmother work ed 
together. She took the administratio n 
under her hands, apparently that™s where 
my  mo th er g o t  th ese 
math ematical Œ i-it 
Œ influence. And my father took care of
 the Œ the forestry, the cutting and the 
taking care of and so forth. 

Q: So they must ha
ve been bilingual. 
A: Yes.

Q: They mu st have spoken German as well as Polish. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And Œ 
A: Except that my grandfather, my maternal
 grandfather came from a family that, 
before the first World War, and I think it was at the mid d le of 19
th
 century, they  
met Œ  my  
[indeciphera ble]
 thro ugh 
Turkey
 from 
Macedonia
, and through the Œ 
through the 
Carpathian 
mountains, came to 
Silesia
, 
Shlunsk
, and th en Œ and Œ 
but my  mo  Œ my  gran dmother was from 
Vierkapolska
(ph), the up 
[indecipherable]
 
Poland
. So somehow they Œ the families arranged it. He was 
dark, tall, my  grandmother was blue eyed w
ith very light blonde hair, and also tall. 

So Œ 
Q: And on your father™s side
 of the fami ly, how did Œ 
how did th ey end up, it was 
Garnisonkirchen
(ph) Œ 
A: 
Garnisonkirche
, yes. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: My grandfather was a cobbler. He de
signed shoes and he was a very good 
cobbler because not only the Po lish army
, but later on the German army  ordered 
the officers™ high boots to be Œ 

Q: From him?  

 
Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski

A: Œ from him. They brough
t the materials and tw o soldiers always watched the 
staircase, and sat there. He worked some
times 12 - 20 hours, in order to finish. 
Q: And this was during the second World War? 
A: During th e second World War, but 
during the first W o rld War, he was in 
Garnisonkirche
. He Œ I don™t know if he had inte
rest, or he wanted  to Œ not to 
abandon the Œ the Œ the Polish immigrants
 that were taken to Œ ba Œ by the 
Prussians to 
Germany
. He received a permission to teach them religion. They 
gave him only the first part of the Bible,
 the Old Testament, 
written in old Polish. 
And for one hour on Su nday , he taught 
them the language, based on the Bible. 
Q: Isn™t that interestin g. 

A: Ah, but also he work ed in th e underg
round, because he was working with the 
Polish work ers, and they wanted  to Œ they
 were fighting for their own rights, in 
order to receive proper payment,
 and to  be properly treated. 
Q: And this is in 
Garnisonkirche
? 
A: And this is in 
Garnisonkirche
, but somehow I think somebody Œ 
Q: Informed on him? 

A: Œ info rmed on him, and he was told th
at the best part would be if he left Œ 
moved northwest, so he 
Œ they went to north 
Dortmund
. And from there on he 
promised himself that 
he will not return to 
Poland
 until 
Poland
 had a government.

The government was establishe
d in 1922, so I believe that it took them almo st two 
years to travel back. 
Q: Amazing. 
A: Yes. 
Q: It™s not such a long distance. 

A: No. 

Q: So clearly these are stories you mu st
 have heard growing 
up, from either your 
parents or your grandparents. Is that so? 

A: Oh yes, 
Jaja
(ph) would always t-tell me  Œ my
 father™s father was also named 
Jusef
(ph), and he wo uld Œ I loved stories. A
pparently I was the only girl at that 
time. I had 11 cousin s, including my  brot
hers and my  cousin  and I was the only 
girl in that age. I had cousin s, girls, but
 they were older, mu
ch older than I was, 
about 10 - 12 years old. Bu t Œ 

Q: Well, that makes y ou quite special. 
A: But I played with them, 
and wh en they  were quarreling, they  always said, okay, 
we have to  have a general. Who is going 
to be the general? They pointed at me 
because I was the only girl. 
Would I quarrel with anybody? 
Q: Yeah. So, tell me a Œ a little bit abou
t what happened to
 your family on 
September 1
st
, 1939, when 
Germ any
 attacked 
Poland
. You were a baby, so Œ

already out of 
Poland

the Œ on the border, 
Pola nd Œ Pola nd

Germ any

[indecipherable]
 1939. 
A: Œ nine Œ yes, 1939, we became the Third Reich. 
Q: So it was very quick, very quick. 
A: Yes, because it was about 30
 Œ 30 or 40 kilometers past 
Oder
 to the town of 
Ko
˚
cian
, that Œ it was not very far. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: They just walked
 in and marched to 
Pozna

.

A: My mother Œ my father 
was in the army, called in Au
gust that he should come 
for to serve in the reserves
, but then  Œ well, he was a second lieuten ant, being a 
teacher and a musician . So, he had the right to be called 
frontow
(ph),
 
right away . 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And Mother tried to move clos
er to her mother, who lived in 
Ko
˚
cian
, which 
was north west of 
Pozna

, and about 30 kilometers northwest of Œ of 
Leszno
. And

we were right Œ few kilometers so uth. Bu
t she told me that she moved from town 
to town, zigzagging back 
and forth until she reached 
Ko
˚
cian
, because it was Œ 
she was already pregnant with my  brother 
Andrew
. But she reached 
Ko
˚
cian 
and 
lived with my 
mo ther and her ailing sister. 
Q: That is with your grandmother. 
A: Yes, with my grandmother, mm-hm. 

Q: And what happened with your father? 
A: My father was caught in an ambush 
in Œ in the forest behind Œ around 
Od er
, 
and that part of the regiment was prac
tically annihilated. He was shot, was 
wounded. Those that were caught, which we
re about 10 Œ he said about 10, maybe 
15 people, but no mo re, cause some of them
 were very wounded, but were alive. 
They  took th em, but he passed out appare
ntly , and after two days, the German 
patrol was walking with dogs, and they st
opped where he was lying, and the dogs 
know if somebody is gone or alive. An
d when they searched
 h im th ey  saw my  
father™s army registration ca-card, a t
eacher™s card, and that he was born in 
Germany
, so they took him for one 
of his Œ one of their own. 
Q: So he wasn™t Œ 

A: They took him to 
Germany
, they took him to a Ger m
an hospital, and he, after 
a month, he came, he was well enough to 
speak, and he was in
terrogated. And my

father said, I am not a German, I am
 a Pole. I was taken Œ I was born in 
Germany
 
because my parents were taken there. 
This was during the part o Œ Prussian 
partition. So Œ 
Q: And so what happened to Œ 
A: Œ then  he was Œ when he came throug
h, they Œ because my  father, being an  
officer, he was taken to 
Mu rna u
, which is 
Ba va ria
, to a 
[indecipherable] 
camp. 
That camp was a camp  that was de
dicated or Œ or protected by 
Himmel
(ph). And 
it was a camp to show off how th
e Germans treat Polish officers. 
Q: So it was sort of like a show camp. 

A: Yes. When there was no visitation, th
ey  would treat it like any other Œ well, 
somebody Œ a prisoner. And, I me an, they ha
d to scrape food. My
 father liked to 
cook, and everybody knew th
is, so he sometimes actual
ly Œ I said Œ he said, I 
talked at the wrong time and was sent back to the Œ 

Q: The kitchen? 
A: Œ kitchen, yes, the ki Œ the kitchen. An
d he said there, at least, I could s Œ I 
could scrape off the Œ the peeling Œ pee
ling the potatoes, I could as Œ I could 
scrape the Œ th-the peels and Œ and save 
it and then cook it behind the barrack, or 
underneath the bed, or Œ or so
 what Œ or whatever. So Œ 
Q: So in  other word s, it was a show camp only sometimes. 

 
Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski

13
A: Oh yes. They had an orchestra,  he 
played in a co Œ a 
symphony. There was a 
theater, there were Œ they had lectur

professors. Polish officers and intelligentsia
 were sent there. So Œ and he stayed 
there til the end of the war. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: When  an  American general was passing by, he open ed Œ my  father was right on 

guard at that time by the Œ by the gates.
 He opened, and he Œ that™s where my  
father learned some English, cause they 
wanted to show off that you could take 

English, you could take French, other Œ to
 improve yourself, to show off that you Œ 
that Œ that the Germans we
re treating them properly. 
Q: And so th at™s why he could practice his English 

A: Yes, yes. And wh en he said, open th
e door, my father said
, that was the first 
command of a different voice asking. I didn™t
 know what to do
. But he said open 
the door, and he showed them what to do.
 So the other fellow who was with him, 
they open ed  the gates, and he went thr
ough, all around. And 
said, you, where is 
your family, do you have a family? And Œ an
d he said, my wife and children are in 
Œ in 
No rdho rn
, in north ern part Œ north
eastern part of Œ of 
Germany
, right next to 
the 
Holland
 border. So he said, I™m going to 
Munich
, hop in . And one Œ as my 
father hopped into the sidecar of the motorcycle, he hur
t his leg. By the time they

got to 
Munich
, my father was collapsing. He ha
d a cut on his right leg, and he 
already had poison. So  they kept him th
ere. But my father 
had a letter from my 
mo ther, who could write to my  dad in 
Mu rna u
 only three times a Œ every year Œ 
every quarter, she could. Every four m
onths she could write a letter. And she 
wrote to him that we are in 
Nordhorn
.  
Q: So that™s in the northwestern part of 
Germany
, if it™s close to the Dutch border 
Œ 
A: Bord er, na Œ yes Œ 
Q: Yes. 

A: Œ northwestern part of 
Germany
, right. Right. 
Q: And Œ and so  he™s liberat
ed by an American general. 
A: By an American general, yes. 

Q: But Œ 

A: And he left him there because th
e Œ because he Œ my dad needed Œ 
Q: Medical attention. 

A: Œ med-medical attention, and this wa
s sometimes in beginning of May, and we 
didn™t see him til a mo nth and 
a half later, when he came to 
Lingen
(ph). 
Q: So fo r all intents and purposes, your 
father was Œ survived the war, but he was 
out of the picture Œ 

 
Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski

15
A: Right. 
Q: Œ as far as your life was concerned. 

A: Right. 
Q: You Œ did you rememb er anyt
hing of him in your first ye
ars, or is the first time 
you remember seeing him, is
 that month and a half later, when  he shows up? 
A: I didn™t Œ I knew only my father fro
m the photograph that was standing on Œ on 
the the table, on the side table at 
home. And in-in-in 
the place where my 
grandmother lived, and wh en I saw him, 
as an almo st seven year old child, I 
looked and I said, that is 
not my father. My father wa
s a handsome man, with a 
bushy hair. This is a sick man, th
is is Œ cause when I saw him in 
Ling en
(ph )  in  
1945 in July, I saw a man bent over, grayis
h hair and Œ and his face was grayish, it 
Œ he looked like he just came out of a 
tomb . He could barely walk, he was so 
weak. So, it was at Œ that™s the first time 
I heard him, after all these Œ  after six 
years of not seeing him. Cause I 
was a year old wh en he left.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: When  he was gone, and I did not see 
him before. But we, my mother and I, we 
stayed in Œ in 
Ko
˚
cian
. It™s through June of 1944. 
Q: So you were there for five Œ five years. 

A: Yes, yes. 

 
Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
16
Q: And your Œ and your fi
rst brother was then born Œ 
A: In 1940. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Yes. He was almost four year
s old when  we were taken out. 
Q: Okay . Was your Œ was your mo ther ab
le to write to your father? Did she find 
out, did she know he was in this prisoner of war camp? 
A: She fo und out through his Œ through hi
s parents, who lived in the same city . 
Q: And Œ 

A: My Œ yes Œ 

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ my  Œ th e 
Zu r c z a k
 family lived 
Ko
˚
cian
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And Œ and my  father 
Œ my  grandfather was the Œ was the shoemaker.  
Q: Ah, so Œ 
A: But Œ but what happened is that my 
mother was notified by her father-in-law 
where 
Jusef
(ph) is and that she ca
n only write once every four months to him. 
And so they  Œ so th at they, many times 
Œ my  mo ther taught me that she would put 
her letter with their letter, in order to make
 certain that it gets there. So my father 
sa Œ had some letters when  he came in 
1944, when he appeared, because he kept 

 
Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski  
 
January 21, 2015 
 

 
 
17
certain letters. But certain letters, I™ve no
ticed that it was only my dear, or my 
beloved, and everything was blacked out.  
Q: Really? 
A: Only  he would Œ and 
[indecipherable] 
I™m kissing you 
[indeciphera b le]
. That 
was all, because whatever he wrote in it,
 was apparently  unacceptable. So somebo 
Œ all the letters were read through before th
ey went to the Œ to the people, on both 
sides. 

Q: Did he know that he had a son? 
A: Yes, yes, and he knew Œ 

Q: And so th ey let 
information through. 
A: Yes, yes, that info Œ yes. 

Q: Okay . And did you see mu ch
 of your father™s parents,
 as in those first years? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Because we lived Œ he 
li Œ they lived behan Œ be 
Œ further from us, where the 
town  square was, and a pond where b
eautiful white swans san Œ swam. And I 
enjoyed the swans. It was Œ I always ask 
my mother, please can I go to the market 
and buy Œ she says, but you™re
 only four years old. I sa
id, Mama, I want to go and 

 
Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski

see Grandpa, but I want to also see th
e swans. And I would always have a few 
crumbs of my  bread left
 for them so I could Œ 
Q: Feed them. 
A: Œ and they would Œ yes, and feed them.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: But we Œ we visited them quite often, 
as was allowed. We could not visit them 
during air raids, or when the soldiers 
were marching, practicing something like 
that, no. 
Q: Was the town full of
 German soldiers?  
A: Yes. We lived right across in a house,
 only in one ro om on the third floor Œ 
well, I mean, I Œ European would be se cond floor. But across the Œ the palace, 

which once belonged to my 
father™s great-grandfather. 

Q: Oh wow. 

A: And well, unfortunately, the 
SS 
cavalry occupied th at. So Œ so we were very, 
very watched. And Œ 
Q: You were watched because 
of that family connection? 
A: That I don™t know. We were watched 
because my  fa Œ my  father being in 
Murden au
(ph), an officer, and they did no
t like my mother, who did not look 
very Polish. My mother was dark skinned,
 with pitch black hair and dark eyes.

Slim. And she was petite, and they always
 called her Œ she had a name, of the 
black crow, they called her. 
Q: The back cr Œ the black crow. 
A: The black crow. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes. And my  mo ther, my  brother and 
I were witnesses. Three ti mes she wa s 

called. She rece Œ received a notice that 
she has to show up at the wall of the 
square wh ere many executions took place, 
and th  Œ the family
, her family, that 
means my  grandmother, my  cousin and th e 
two of us had to go and witness. And 

of course, most of the people were 
there too, witnessing who was being Œ 
Q: Executed? 

A: Œ executed. And they always left my 
mother til the en d. My mother was al Œ 
and I remember her, she was always dresse
d in a black skirt, black shoes, black 
stockings, a white blouse, and she would wa
lk in, and when they
 went to put the Œ 
close her eyes, put the band on her eyes, 
she says, I don™t need it. And th en they  
would get ready, and th e 
commander would come in and say, not today, black 

crow.

ing around, they said, oh, 
next time again. Next time again. 
Q: And so you Œ 
A: So th ree times, it was 1943, and 1944 was 
the last time. I think it was in Œ right 
after Easter, which was April. 

Q: And you™re a five year old child? 
A: I was five and a half. I was waiting Œ 
September wa Œ in ™44 was going to  be 
my  sixth birthday. I mean, not

rd
 was going to be 
my  next birthday, wh en I would be six years old. Bu t at the age of four, I knew 

how to read, how to count, and how to 
write. And wh en somebody says, how do 
you know what kind of a boo
k is this, or what paper 
this is, I say, in Polish 
[speaks Polish]
 It had to rhyme, I don™t know wh
y, because I Œ my  mo ther always 
said, we™re going to  
Jaja
(ph), or we™re going to 
Ba bcia
 for their birthday or their 
Imieniny

out, we co uld only go up on our street, 
in front of the house. And watch out 
because when the alarm struck, 
everybody had to be inside. 
Q: And there were lots of air raids? 
A: Oh, rot Œ lots, lots. Especially Œ I rememb er those in ™43, and ™44, quite well. 
Q: Well, you know, one of my  questions

your Œ whatever your earliest me mo ries
 would be, they are during wartime.  
A: Yes.

A: Right. 

Q: So, are your earliest memories conn
ected to the war, or are they some Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay . 

A: Yes, just Œ just to the war. I remember 
th at the first memory 
that I have is when  
we were totally isolated from the bedroom
 of my cousins, from his mother, who 
was dying of tuberculosis. And in  that ro
om was a wind Œ veranda window, glass, 
that you Œ you know, there 
were shades that you coul
d close and open. Why we 
were there, don™t ask me, I don™t know. No body ev er told me this.

A: Or maybe they to ld me, but I don™t re
member. This was 1942, so I was barely 
four years old. And I was always afraid 
to go to that room, because there was Œ 
one wall was the glass, the opposite wall 
was composite of doors. And later on I 
found out that books were 
on one side, and a wardrobe 
was on th e other side. But 
somebody to ok something out of it and le
ft a black strip of a Œ I don™t know, 
maybe of a Œ a sash, or something, but it 
was looking at me. And wh en that black 
sash disappeared, I sai d  she died. 
Q: And were you right? 
A: Yes. Because I told my 
mother this. And on that ni
ght, or day, she died. But I 
think Œ I don™t rememb er to be a child. I always had to  take care of one boy, an d 
the other on the other hand. My  p Œ my  brother 
Andrew
 was on th e right side, and 
Izbisznik
(ph) was on the left said. He wa
s older, but he missed his mo ther. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And I think boys are mo re babies in 
the Œ when they™re younger, they, I™m not 
sure a little bit later. N o t all, but 
some do. But most of them do. 
Q: But he was alone. He was alone. 

A: Yes, he was Œ he was very mu ch alone
, and Œ and if he didn™t get what he 
wanted, he Œ his father oh, 
by th e way, his father was a 
prisoner of war, taken for

labor. He was in 
Poland
, then he was taken to 
Germany
, and then I heard that he 
went outside, was he in 
Holland
, or was he in denya Œ 
Denmark
, I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But they were Œ people were talking.
 This Œ this I remember at many times 
Grandma says, oh, 
Franek
(ph) is there again. Or he 
is moved again. But Œ but my  
cousin was very Œ he was very attached 
to his mo ther, and to grandmother. If he 
didn™t like something, he would lay on 
the floor and have a tantrum. Only  my  
mother could tell him, 
Izbiszu
(ph), get up. You™re not goi
ng to  get anything to  eat.  
Q: So, why Œ she was targeted
 Œ your mother was target
ed by the authorities, the 
Nazi authorities because she was dark, or
 because she was an officer™s wife? 

A: No, they just didn™t like her, 
b ecau se my  mo th er
 looked too Œ 
Q: Jewish? 
A: Mediterranean. Yes, too Jewish, yes. A
nd lot of people that Œ remember I said 
my  grandfather, her father was of a Mace
donian heritage. So naturally he was 
dark, black hair and slightly  slanted eyes. 
One of my  brothers has that feature. So 
Œ and my  mo ther would not step by. Bu t th
e last time, when she was taken to the 
execution square, as we called it, someth
ing happened . And my  mo ther told  me 
she just Œ she had enough, because he offended her.

she just Œ she™s, I couldn™t stand it 
any more, and I spit straight in his face. 
He took Œ that I remember, h e took his big 
glove and slapped my  mo ther and she 
fell on the ground. There were Œ it was 
rubble there, and I know that she had a 
wound someplace on the side of the head , 

because ther Œ the blouse was stained, and we were all crying. 
Q: So he would really Œ he ordered 
all of you children to watch as if Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ your mo ther is going to be shot. 
A: Mm-hm, yes, yes. My

sign that she believes in God, but
 she™s not a Roman Catholic Œ 

A: Right.

Q: Okay . 

A: No, I don™t Œ not remember. I don™t remember. 
Q: How did Œ how did she feed you during 
those years, cause your father™s gone.

 was an original forest, and I could 
pick up all the Œ all Œ oh, anything that

your daughter Œ my  daughter is

to walk, you know, in order 
for Œ for hygienic reasons. An
d she said, when he tells 
you to stop, and not look, turn around, an
d then he will disappear, you see what is 
there. Once he rolled in an orange. Who 
could get an orange? 
He mu st have gotten 
it from somebody, okay? And I don™t know 
what I did. My brother was playing 

ball, and the ball came to the Œ to the railing.

Once when we came in and four months late

wanted so  badly to get a shower, or Œ or 
a tub or something. And my  mo ther said

s lockjaw. And then, after lockjaw, I got 

another me asles, germ Œ the German measle
s, so I was locked up for another six 
months in a dark room. I could un
derstand everything, but I could not 
communicate. I could show, I could 
write, but I could not speak.

repairing the bedsheets and sewing othe

And there were over 200 beds 
underneath the stable built. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: Nobody knew, and nobo
dy discovered, even though
, besides the nuns, the 
Evangelische schwester
, there were 30 brown 
schwester
. Those were 
Hitlerjugend 
nurses. Not in white and blue stri
pes, but white and brown stripes. 
That™s why they were called the brown 
schwesters
. And when  the nuns ate, my 
brother and I, we ate w ith them, 
because one of the nuns, Sister 
Marta
, decided 
that we were her nieces, and that we were 
in the hospital. My brother didn™t speak 
German, he didn™t even want to speak, pe
riod. He only talked 
to me Œ to my ear, 
when he wanted. But they t
ook us, when we finished ea
ting, they  Œ the nuns left, 
and then  the other sisters, the brown 
schwesters
, the nurses came, and they sat in a 

different part of the Œ of the Œ wh at th
e ta Œ their tables w as in a different Œ

they  had different dishes, because this 
was all provided by the Œ

ther found this out, she went to Dr. 
Becker
 and she said, this is the end. She sa
id, it™s not signed yet, but the war is 
over, because I received it from 
Munich
, from the Americans, that the end Œ it™s 
the end of the war. 
Q: On th at Palm Sunday? 

A: Yes, on that Palm Sunday. We were Œ 
I think we were the first ones to know 
about it, because

Beck Œ Becker 
asked her and told  her that because this was a

Germans were there. And they were the

A: Yes, yes, we were stamped.

Q: Did your daughter ever 
ask you about this stuff? 
A: I think sh e knows certain 
things because I said, ask 
Grandma
. That means, ask 
my mother. I said, my
 mother will tell you certain thi
ngs. But my mother was very 
Œ she w Œ she was not scrupulous, but she 
only said Œ only told her certain things 
and that™s it. In general, that™s it, beca
use she says, I don™t want her sh Œ because 
my daughter is very sensitiv e. She knows that, you know,
 his mother lived to be 
103, desp ite the fact th at she Œ it was mean
t for her to live that 
long. But they were 
very, very close, as a Œ as a family. The

d I told him, I said, you know, I found 
certain papers, going through some of th e things. He still doesn
™t want to go and 
see them. 
Q: Of course. 
A: But, I said, you know, 
they™re very good poems. An
d he said well, you would

a literary major, but I Œ I was a Œ I recited 
poetry, not only of Polish, but of Œ in Œ in 
Œ in Italian, and in Œ in  English, and Œ 
and I love poetry. And you know, certai
n poems, when I had to tran slate from 

French into English and then write
 about it, what 
it really meant. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I would always get the best results 
on my  Œ on Œ on my  grading papers. And 
sometimes says, how do you 
know this? I said, well, 
I happened to  go thro ugh 
certain things, which I can read between th

it is. This is what the poet says. So, y

m, but what was going on, the essence 
was Œ is there.

this is something that
 she left behind her.

Q: I just can™t be Œ I Œ I™m
 still amazed. In all of the th
ings that you are describing,

 They™re known because we know the 
history Œ

A: I don™t know. Because, you know, it™s 
something I Œ and really I cannot say

what a Girl Scout does, doesn™t it? Beside
s, there were people who helped us wh en 
we were unable to do it ourselves, beca
use that™s what Mother said. Sometimes 
people wo uld take us by the hands and Œ 
or carry us even, because we were so

A: It delayed us by two and a half mon-m
onths, and we left actually on Œ again, on 
the 10
th
 of October, from 
Bremen
.  
Q: In 1949. 

A: In 1949, on General 
Black
, which was an army sh-ship. 
Q: Ship. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And sailed into 
New York
? 
A: Sailed Œ we a Œ no, we had to  detour and go to 
Ellis Island
, my mo ther, I and 
the youngest one. My father and 
Andrew
 went to 
New York
, then they took us 
back on the ship, 24
 hours later fro m 
Ellis Island
 and brought us to 
New York
 
harbor. That™s where 
I got my green card. 
Q: And how did you 
end up here in 
Chicago
? 
A: We had a sponsor in 
Wisconsin
, who happened  to be a 
Jehovah Witness
. He 
found out that my  father was well-educ
ated, knew several languages, and that Œ

cause they wanted somebody to run th ei
r community. They ne
eded a bishop, and 
they would make him a bishop. And my  fa
ther says, never! And it was cat Œ well, 
you know, through 
NW Œ  NCWC
. They found out, they said this man Œ that 
family cannot, they  are Roman Catholic. So, when  we changed trains from 
New 
York
 at 
Union Station
 and got on the Œ the 
Hiawatha
 train, we landed in Œ in 
Lisbon
, and there was nobody to 
pick us up. And half an
 hour later came a Œ a 
priest, and spoke to us in English, sort 
of sounding Polish, and 
said, I will have to 
take you. My mother lives here, not far 
away , and we™re going Œ we have to talk. 
We had to find another sponsor. There™s 
a woman who will take you. She has one 
goat and two rabbits, and Œ an
d Œ and three or four chic
kens, and she has a small 
garden , and she would lo Œ she would love
 to take you in. Oh, my  goodness. My 
mo ther cried. Of course it was impossible. Sh e was lately demented, but she was a 

very good woman. And the priest himself 
realized that this was not the place. So 
he called the chancellery office in
 that area, and we landed in 
New Lisbon
, not far 
from 
Mauston
, 
Wisconsin
. And a farmer, a Mr. 
Barlette
(ph), who was a Belgian, 
married to an Irish woman, they had a bi
g farm. A very wealthy man, cause he had 
500 cattles and all that stuff 
and Œ and oh, acres and acre
s of Œ of fields. And we 
were there for six weeks, but my father
 had to  wo rk from four o™clock in th e 
morning til eight o™clock at midnight Œ at 
night, and many m
ilking and doing all

farm work. I mean, you know, he was not Œ 
physically he was not ready to do this, 
to work like this. He wanted
 any work, he never complain
ed. I had to say he never 
Œ but my  mo ther wo rk Œ wo rked  as a 
housekeeper. She cleaned the whole house, 
all the windows. I was just 
turned 11 years old. I was 
ironing 30 shirts a week, 
because there were people working, and do ing things. In the morning we got up at 
six o™clock and at 6:
30 we had Œ we walked three mi les to 
New Lisbon
, cat Œ 
caught a bus that took us to 
Ma u sto n
, to a Catholic school, which was run by 
German nuns. And at least I could conf
er Œ co nverse freely with somebody. I 
knew some English, because I Œ we weretaught English by the British soldiers. 

They were Œ one time we had a Englis
h major, and then we had a Scottish 
sergeant. And he ri Œ loved the Polish 
language because it was such a beautiful 
R
. 
We could ro ll our 
Rs
, as he said.  
Q: As they can too. 

A: And they  can too. O-On
ly th-they can too. So, you
 know, it was Œ but I knew 
German very well, and English was in my 
ears. I could hear it, but it was difficult 
for me to Œ to express myself, because the German would Œ 

Q: Come in. 
A: Come in, and well, it Œ it worked itself out. The Father 
Evans
 who took care of 
us, he said, you know, I 
received a call from the 
Chicago
 chancellery, and there™s

a Franciscan priest, who apparently kno
ws you. And yes, because he was in 
Auschwitz
, and then he was in 
Dachau
. And he came out, and he lived with us 
and Œ in li Œ 
Lingen
(ph). And I think then  the order asked him to Œ to  come to 
America
. And he stayed here, because he had 
TB
. Bu t he came out of it, and we 
only saw him here for a very 
few weeks, and he orga Œ 
he found somebody here to 
take care of us, and Œ 
Q: In 
Chica go

A: In 
Chica go
, and we left Œ we got here of
 Œ three or four days before 
Thanksgiving.

Q: And you met Mr. 
P a wlikowski
 in what year? In the 50s? 
A: Oh, in  1957? Yes, 1957 at the scouting celebration of Œ of Ch ristmas and I 
happened  to  be playing the role of Blesse
d Virgin, because I had hair long down  to 
hear. So Œ and I sang, apparently, pretty 
well. So I had my  Œ and I didn™t have time 
to even comb it properly, I just put it in th

and Œ and Œ 

Q: It worked. 
A: Yes, and I had a uni Œ my  scout unifo
rm, and Œ and we were pouring coffee and 
tea, and bringing, you know, 
sweets to the Œ to the parents, and Œ and guests and 
that™s how Œ and then  he realized that he sa
w the same g irl in church that he saw in 

the unifo rm. And he stopped me one day wh en I was coming from 
North Avenue
, 
and that™s how it started. 
Q: A nice debut. A nice debut. Well, is th
ere anything else you would like to add 
to what we™ve talked abou

Pawlikowski
, is there something you™d like your gran ddaughter, 
Kinga
(ph) to 
understand about wh at happened  to  you, 
what you went thr
ough, how you came 
out of it? 
A: Endurance. It Œ it Œ it requires a pe
rsonal en durance. And education, and 
following th e right way. Always
 be noble. Even if one makes a mi stake, it is not a

sin to say, I done this and then apologize
. Otherwise, if y ou don™t have the nobility 
to do this, the noble heart, 
then you™re not a fu ll person. And if Œ and have a strong 
belief in what you want to do, and follow 
it. Follow your calling. But first, learn. 
Get a good education, just like we trie
d to instill it in our daughter, who went 
through the Jesuit education for nine y
ears, and Œ and got a scholarship, full 
scholarship to in Œ to 
Loyola
, and then Œ 
Q: Congratulations. 
A: Œ and studied  a whole year in 
Rome
. So it was Œ it was an opening. She was 21, 
she Œ on her 21
st
 birthday, she went to 
Poland
 and had the Christma s Œ she could 
have come to 
Chicago
, she could have come here. But 
she went over thor Œ there, 
and she brought a Po lish soul with her. 
They  didn™t even  want to celebrate 
Wigilia
, which is the Christmas eve. And sh
e says, what? I am going to buy th e 
Christmas tree, I am going to dre
ss it, and I am going to set the 
Wigilia
 for you. I 
will go and stand in line and buy fish. And th
is was only what, ™87? Winter of ™87. 

And she did it. 
Q: Wow, that™s quite a legacy 
for your gran ddaughter to have. 
A: Yes.

at she was so str o ng, and she exhibited 
that.
