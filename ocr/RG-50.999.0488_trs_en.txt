W e have prepared a brief 
slide presentationto help with his introduction.
 
 
W ebegin with this photograph of Frank 
L i e ber m a nn
. 
 
He was born in 
G liwic e
, 
Germ any in 1929.
  
He  wa s  t
he only child of Hans andLotte 
Liebermann
. Onthe lef t we see 
Hans Liebermann 
andon the right we see Lotte andher granddaughter Joannie.     
 
 
Bothof  Frank's parents' familieshad lived inthis partof  Germany for several 
generations. Frank is pictured
 
with his paternal grandparents,Bernard and Jenny 
Lieberm ann.
 
Hitler cam e topower in 1933,and when Frank began school in 1935, Jewish students were 
separatedf rom the non

Jewish students andfear of 
anti

S em it ic

contain sweets tomake school sweet.  Frank is in the
 
second
 
row, thefourthf rom the right.
  
I 
don't know if  you can seem y cursor, but there we go. 
 

 
In 1936
,  
Frank's fathe
r was no longer able topracticem edicine as aresult of  
anti
-
Jewish laws
.  
In 1938
, 
thef am ily tried toobtain visas to com e to the United States. Hans 
traveledf irst and Frank and hism otherf ollowed af ew m onths later in October of 1938.  Here 
we see Frank'sm other's ticket for the shipthey took to the United States.
 
 
T he  
Lieberm ann 
fam ily settled in Ohio and Frank went on to graduatef rom W estern 
Reserve, now CaseW estern Reserve Univer sity, in 1950 with a degree in chem istry.

In that same year he married Marianne, his wife of nearly 64 years. Frank worked in textile 
m anuf acturing until1992 when he and Mariannem ovedto theW ashington, DC, areatob
e 
closer to their children.  Frank would last three months in retirem entbefore going into thetravel 

business which he continuestoday, specializi ng in Europe and U.S.travel, including Alaska.
  
He just recently joined a new agency, Signature T ravel, in M
aryland. 
 
 
Frank and Mariannehave three children,two daughters and a son.T heir daughters, 
Nancy and Joan, live in thisareaand their son Jerry is in Seattle. They havef ive 

grandchildren with the youngest about to turn23. As Franknotes,are now gainfully em ployed.  
His grandson is preparing f orhis Ph.D. inm odern European history.  Frank notes that Aaron is 
m otivated by thefam ily's history.  Frank, Aaron, and Aaron's sister Elissa went to Poland, the 
Czech Republic, andSlovakia in 2013. They stopped in 
G liwic e
, the city in which F
ra n k wa s 
born and isnow part of Poland.  
 
 
I'm  glad to say Marianne andtheir closef riendsT om  and Peggy are  here with us

W

You toldm e that yourearliestm em ories start in 1934 when you were 5 years old. 
You also said of that tim e, that ﬁall

all it was a good timeﬂf or your parents. Tell us why that 
was so and what you can about yourf am ily and their life in 
G liwic e
 
andabout yourself  in
 
those 
f irst years of your lif e.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
My f ather was an ear,nose, throat surgeon. W elived on the 
m
ain 
s
treet, which is comm on in Europe because they had street car connections.  Very f ew people 
had cars atthat tim e. Wehad an apartment in back of the off ice.  One of the exciting things 
thathappened in 1934is that we got a m iniature convertible, literally m iniature.
 
[Laughter]
 
Sm aller than aVW . W e used thatto visit m y grandparents, living about50
 
m iles in one 
direction
;  
the other ones about20
 
m iles further east.
  
On m y f irsttrip , I'm  to ld
 
--
 
oh, Ihave to 
say, horses were still used widely f or makingdeliveries.  Andthef irst time I went to the 
c oun t r y 
and saw cows, I said, "W
h
atf unny looking horses."
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: T hef act that you hada car was unusual, that thefam ily had a car; r
i gh t ?
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Def initely.  It was notused
 
--
 
m y f athertookthe street car tothe 
hospital. T hat was a better way of
 
getting around.  Inf act, we were to walk about three blocks 
to get to a garagebecause you couldn't park it anywhere.

>> Bill Benson:  And your father,as youm entioned, was a surgeon.  Tell us a little bit about 
your f ather'sfam ily business.
 
>> F r a n k  
L
ieberm ann:
  
You mean m y mother's
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  sorr y.  Your mother'sf amily business.  Y
eah. 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
In 1933,m y m other'sside of thef am ily celebrated the100th 
A
nniversary of  their business in Germ any wh ere they hada wholesale leatherbusiness wi th a 
tannery. W hen things started getting bad, they were one of thosepeople who said
,  "T
hings 
wi ll b lo w o ve r
.  W
e survi ved starvation duringW orldW ar I by barte
rin g.  Th is, too , sh a ll pass."  
W
e were the only ones who got out. 
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  Frank, you started school in1935, attending apublic school.  You toldm ethat 
recess was them ost dangerous tim efor you. Can you say a littlebit about that? 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
W ehad to leave the building.  Theplayground was divided betw
een 
boys on one side, girls on theother side. Ourteachers stayed in them iddle totry to give us  
som e protection. W ehad three classroom swithin the school of what was a public school.  In 
fact, we got perm ission to arrive a littlebit later and leave f ive m inutes earlier so that we could 
saf ely get away f rom  the grounds inorder not tobe subject tobeing attacked.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So Jewish kids had three classroom s in this largepublic school.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:  How large was
 
the Jewish population in 
Gliwice
?  
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
About 1,000 fam ilies.
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasa major city.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
The city was about 120,000. So it was apretty sm all proportion. The 
Jewish population in Germ any was about one half of  onepercent. So it was easy to target.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. Frank, bef ore we m ove on tothe events thatled up to your leaving 
Germ any, tell usa little bit about your m other.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
In what
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us aboutherf r
om  those early years.  She m et your f ather af ter he was 
well established.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Oh. They m et through a f riendat af raternity social
 
when she was 16 
a
nd waiteduntilm y father hadf inished his residency and specialty training.  They got ma
rri e d  
in 1928. She was 20. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And then you were born, of  course,a year later.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Onem ore point about that tim e, about yourfam ily.  I think you told me that 

you could tracefam ily living there in that areaasf ar back as the 1700s.  So yourf am ily had 
been establishedfor many, many years in this part of Germ any.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Ye s .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Backa couple of centuries. 
--
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Yes.  Inother words, really going wa y back,Jews were never allowed 
to own land. T hey stayed in sm all cities andthen gradually integrated after Napoleon, really, 

who f urthered integration. Theyf elt very m uch partof the com munity.  T he Holocaust got 
ever ybody totally unprepared.

>> B ill B e n
son:  And leading upto that, in1936
,  
circum stances for your parents turn m ore 
om inous,becamem ore difficult if  not dangerous. Tell us what was signif icant. W hat changed 
in 1936? 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Af terW orldW ar I there was a war between partly E
ngland, France.  
T hey kind of tried tof ill in the vacuum  between RussiaandGermany. T his is when 
Czechoslovakia was established as
 
partof  the Austria HungarianEm pire, in other words, was 
separated.  Poland was establishedaf ter having been dom inated by foreign powers for very 

m any years.  In orderto protect them inorities becausepopulationswere m ixin g, there was a 
treaty thatf or 50 years m inorities would beprotectedoneither sideof the border. That treaty 
was over in 19
 
--
 
treaty was over in 1936.  Soeven though the Nazi laws started earlier in the 
rest of Germany, the border area was relatively still m inority
-
f riendly andthen lost those 
protections very suddenly in 1936.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just because that treaty expired. 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Expired. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In that same year, in1936, your mother made a trip to Israel f ora very specif ic 

purpose. Tell us about her trip to Israel in 
‚
36 .
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
She wenttogether wit h one of her brothers to explore whether
 
--
 
if  
ther
e was a way of m aking a livin g.  T hey cam eback with the realizationthat in Israel
 
--
 
I think 
there was one doctorfor every 100 people
 a
nd that doctors were becom ing chickenfarm ers 
because there'sno way of m aking a living.  And that kindof  vetoed the idea of going to Israel.
 
T he way we got to theUnited States was becausem y grandf ather was a 
ge n
e
a lo gis t
 
and he 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

found this relative.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we turn to that, as your parents began trying to think of how they were 
going to get out of Germ any, Israel wasn't going to work, oneof  them em ories youhave isthat 
your parentstold you that it was urgentfor you to learnhow to swim . 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
They said there's a strong possibility that we'll takeanocean voyage.  
T he pool is going to
 
close in July of 1936 with the endof  them inority protection laws.  It's 
im perative that you learn how to swim  beforethat.  As it got close, my grandf ather cam e 
wi t h  
m e to the pool and said, "W
earenot going hom e until you take a test
;
"  which, at that 
t im e ,  
required 20 m inutes non
-
stop swim m ing or treading water.
 
>> Bill Benson: W as your grandf atherable to go hom e?
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
W e wenthom e with a certificate. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that time, 1936 and1937, tell usabout yourfather,how your f ather 

was doing f rom  a work standpoint with theanti
-
S e m it ic  la ws  t a k in gf u ll ef f e ct .
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
W ell,he was an ear,nose, throat surgeon.  He losthis hospital 
privi leges
 i
n 1936.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they were gone. 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
They also hadan SA. They were the brownshirts. T here were two  
kinds of Nazi f ront line organizations. T he SA were pretty m uchthebeer hall thugs, if I 
c an 

use thatexpression. The elite were theSS.Andeventually theSSgot rid of  the
 
SR, but they 
were used pretty m uch until close toW orldW ar II,and there was anSR, brown shirt, inf ront of

theoff ice questioninganybody who wanted to go into the apartment houseasking what their 
business was and if they wantedto go tom y father's o
ff ice, t
hey took their name and said i
f 
you go in there, you'll have repercussions on your job.
  
So it gotpretty serious.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So not only doeshe lose hishospital adm itting privileges
 
but the intim idation 
was so severe on hispractice.
 
 
F ra n
k, if  you don'tm ind, I'm  going toadjust your m ic just a little bit if it's ok. See if  
thatm akes any kind of differenceat all.T here we go.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
I ca n 't te ll.
 
>> Bill Benson:  During
 
--
 
so your father's business is obviously reall y suff ered. How was he 
able
 
--
 
how was thefam ily able to m ake ends m eet during that period? 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
W ehad to live f rugally, offany savings that they hadaccum ulated. 
Andeventually m y m other'sf ather and grandfather said
,  ﬁL
ook,maybe you shouldmove.  I'll 
support you.
ﬂ
  
Even though we had recordsof the business where the volume went down 
between 1933 and1938 when the business was conf iscatedf rom  100,000 to 20,000.  So, in 
other words, econom ic blockade was very su bstantial.  
 
 
Also, by the way, bank accounts weref rozen.  You could only take enoughmoney 
that was deem ed by the governm ent asnecessary f or living.  And itwas strictl y f orbiddento 
take any m oney out of  the country. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about the little spacefor a garden that your parents rented. 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Since it was dangerous to go to any parks orany specif ied 
playgrounds
,  
outsideof town they had what were known as gardenswhich they now have in

Brooklyn, by the way.  T hey are parts wherepeople in theneighborhood can grow f ruits, 
vegetables, whatever it was.  But these were a little bit bigger so that these becam eour 
supervised playgrounds.  There were f ivef amilies who participated. Ever ybody, thefam ilies, 
took turns taking us there to seethat it was relatively saf e.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas the one little saf ehaven to go play as kids.
 
 
Your fam ily didn't keep a kosher kitchen yet you shoppedform eat at a kosher 
establishm ent.W hy was that? 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
There were a thousandf am ilies. Som eof  them  were religious.  A lot of 
them  were not.  But the people who kept kosher couldn'tbuy enough to keep the butcher in 

business, soeverybody used the kosher business inorder to help the community.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In January
 
1938, your f ath
erm ade a trip to the United States that becam e
 
--
 
m ade itpossiblef or him  to move to the U.S. in June of that year. Tell us about his trip in 
January and the events that leduptohis leaving f or the United States in June of 1938. 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
 
As we got
 
--
 
as we located the relatives thatm y grandfatherf ound,m y 
father took a trip to New York and also had thef am ily job of f inding out if  there were any other 
relatives because onm y m other's side there was a fam ily
 
--
 
one of  the fam ily 
m
arried Michael 
Gra tz
 
who became prom inent during the revolutionary tim e in Philadelphiaandf oundeda 
college.  Rebecca Gratz was pretty well
-
known, but she never m arried. And he lookedat the 
archives in Philadelphia.  Her brother went west, which meant Louisvil le, Kentucky. 
 

[Laughter]
 
At which there were no further records. Sothat part of the trip was unsuccessful.  Buthealso 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

did registerf or the state boards inOhio which passed half  of all people taking theexam s.
 
>> Bill Benson:  State boardfor?
 
>> F r a
n k 
Lieberm ann:
  
For m edicine.  And then cam e back with anaff idavitf rom  the relative 
who was located thatwe wouldn't be on welfaref orone year.  Now, theaff idavit which was 
usedas a generic term comm itted you to geta num berf rom  the United States to 
apply f or a 
visa.  T he quota, by the way, f or the United Statesat that time was 25,000 peoplef rom  

Germ any, lim itedpretty much to the proportion of the populationas it existed in1921. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the ability to get that visaunder the quota was exceptionally diff icult.
 
Your father, tell us about hisattem pts to get his visa and, particularly, if you don'tm ind, about 
Fraulein Schm idt. 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
W e got anum ber in January when he applied. T he quota
 
--
 
we knew 
thatthe quota had not
 
beenf illed. He called af riend of his and said, "
W
hat can Ido to 
expeditem y visa?  After all, I can't work andwe want to leave
 n
ow that we have a chance."  
T
hey said, well
,  
it would be a good idea
 
--
 
the counsel has a secretary b y the name of Fraulein
 
Schm idt.  Fraulein m eans m iss.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And this was the U.S. Counsel's off ice.

booked thenext available ship to leavef or the United States. T he visa was goodf or 120days.  
 
 
Ever y person hadperm ission to take10m arks outof  the country.  T hat in1938, 
currency values
 
--
 
of  the exchange was
 
$2.50. T hat's probably about the equivalent of 
about
 
$40,
 
$50 today.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas the lim it?
 
>> F r a
n k 
Lieberm ann:
  
That was the lim itof  what you couldtakeoutbecause thebank 
accounts were f rozen. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout yourfather leaving f or the UnitedStates
 
when he 
f inally did get the visas, he canceledthe lease that he hadonhis medical office
 
an
d  th at 
prompted a visitf rom the Gestapo.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Again, I m entioned f rozen bank accounts.  The equivalent of  a lease 
was that you took a mortgage
 
--
 
you ga ve the landlord a mortgage.  Inother words, you gave 
h i m  a s um
 
of money in saf e keeping.  And aslong as he had thatmoney, you were protected 
in your apartm ent house, store, whatever it was. W hen he canceled it, he got
 
--
 
the mortgage 
was transferred to another bank where he had his account.  Somebody at the landlo
r d 's  ban k  

reported to the Gestapo that a large sum of money had been withdrawn f rom the bank and 
they should check it out.  
 
 
So the two Gestapo people came into the office and said, " Y
o
u're under arrest."  He 
said, " For what?"  Said, "W e
 
gota report that
 
you withdre w that
 
sum of m oney."   And he said, 
"I

you can't
 
do anything with it.

Lieberm ann:
  
You can't take it out.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So wit h thef rozen bankaccount, with the equivalence of  maybe
 
$40,
 
$50 in 
today's money, asthem oney thathe was allowed to take out of thecountry, how was he able 
tof igure out a way to f inance his way to the UnitedStates and knowing that youand your 
m other would rem ain behindf or a period of tim e? 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
At thattim e you could still use money to buyan ocean ticket.  If you 
bought
 
--
 
if  you wentf irst class, you were able to getaf airly good spending allowance which is 
supposed to be used on the boat
; l
ike you goon a Caribbean cruise.  And they encouragethat. 
But at thattim e you were still able to take itout when you arrived in the United States. So 
basically that's how he existed.  
 
 
And that's the reason
 
--
 
the visa was f or120days.  Thatmeans that if m y m other 
andI stayed in Germ any until October, thenwe wouldn't have any expenses until he was 
alm ost ready to take the state boards.  At that tim e he had a room for
 
$5 a week in Cleveland
 
w

T hat also is part of thebackground. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So, 
F

starts studying f or his boards.  He's livin g 
in  a
 
$5 a week place. You and your m otherare 
s t ill in  
G liwic e
.  You have a visa that's good 
until som etim e in October. T ellus what youknow about how your m other was abletoboth 
take care of you and her during that tim eand her preparation to getoutbefore the visa 
expired.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Basically, at that tim eyou could still pack your belongings providing 
you pay 100%tax onever ything that you take out.  Am ong other things, she got a sewing 
m a ch
ine so that if necessary if she had to 
s e w 
clothes, she could do that. It was taxed atthe 
full value, but them oney had nom eaning.  So we did get out quitea bitof  ourf urniture
.  T
hey 
hadthatf urniture until they died.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat she was ableto getout.  During thattime
 
--
 
go ahead. I'm sorry. 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
I was going to say, inSeptember we
 
got abarrage of  telegram s.  
"P
lease get an earlier ship." W e hadno idea what it was because censorship was absolute.  
T here was nof ree
 
press.  It was a capital crim eto listen to outsideradio stations. W e had no 
idea whatsoever what it was about. 
  
Furtherm ore, when we
 
--
 
we weren't able to get any 
earlier ship. W hen we f inally did get totheboat in Bremerhaven, there was no ship. 
 
>
> Bill Benson: T he one that you were scheduled to leave on.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
The onethat we were scheduled to leave on.  And we only f ound out 
what happenedoncewe were on the ship. During this tim e youhad Munich where Daladier of  

France and Cham berlain of  Englandnegotiated with Hitler f orpeace in our tim e by gi ving a way

thebalance of power in Europebecausethepotential allies lost 14divisions at G

During that tim e Hitler 
threatened 
the alliesorwhat becam e the allies by calling back 
all of  the ships at sea and saying that if  Idon't get what I want, I'm  going to declare war.  
That 
ship was called backf rom  already
 
the beginning of  the Atlantic Ocean and lostf our days 
bef ore all of that blew over.
  
 
 
T he trip took six days.
 
>> Bill Benson:
  
Before you tell usabout that 
--
 
I do want you to tell us about that. W hile itwas 
just you and your mother preparing to go, during that
 
tim e you brokeyour arm .  I would like 
you to share that, what happened.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
Ok. W e were playing tag.  I brokem y arm . And that happens to have 
been
 
--
 
that was not inthat garden.T hat was a place where I went with m y bicycle, a litt
le  b it  
outof  town.  You would norm ally call 911.  My instincts toldm ethat's nota good idea. I was 
able to ridehom e with one arm .  I gothom e. My m other called up the orthopedic surgeon in 
town and saidm y sonseem s tohave brokenhis arm , 
c a n 
you se

ﬁN

Jewish children.
ﬂ
  
Shef rantically called otherpeople that she knew, including the hometown of

, ﬁ
I'll take careof  you, but here's what you 
have todo. Takea taxi to

m ovement back.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, the surgeonsandthe physicians that your m other had triedto 

get had beenessentially colleagues of  yourf ather.
 
>>
 
Frank Lieberm ann:
  
They were colleagues.  They went tom eetings together. Butthe 
control thatthe Nazis got unbelievably fast ishard to imagine. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So October
 
1938, shortly before your visa was expir ing, as you described,you 
went through the scare of  the ship not being there but you were able to get the shipeventually 
and youm ade it totheUnited States. W hat do 
you 
remember about your trip across the 
A t la n t ic .
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
By the way, I will m ention real quick. It took six days f or the shipto 
cross.  Since the schedule was always se ven days, it tookf our crossings in order to get back 

on schedule. W e were the fourth crossing. This is how we got to New York.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And what was that trip likefor you, theexcitem ent of  reuniting with your father 

butalso leaving behind what you were leaving behind? 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
W ehad, by the way, the cheapestf irst classcabin which was right i n 
f ront of the b

the bow

dive into the waves and then come up kind of with a jerk when the water was off . My m other 

never left the cabin. She pretty m uch had a breakdown. 
 
 
On oneday there were only six people in thefirst class dining

>> Bill Benson:  So you make itto the United States.  You go to Cleveland.  You're reunited 
with your father. W hat was that likefor you? Do you rem ember? 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
It was happy
 
that we got together,especially when we f oundout about 
Munich. And what hewas tr ying to do to getus there.  He had rented aone
-
bedroom 
apartm ent inthis Cleveland. He hadanotherm onthand ahalf of  the state boards, which, by 

the way, hef ortunately passed on thef irst try.  
 
 
It went pretty smoothly f rom that pointof  view with one big exception.  My parents 
went to am ovie thef irst time.  I think they had aW ednesday special, something like
 
--
 
I d on 't 
know if  it was 10 or 25 cents. And they asked a neighbor to look in on me. That was theirf irst 
tim eout.  At about 9:00
 
the telephone rang.  My grandparents called that this was 
Kristallnacht; that m y m other's brothers had been arrested, the business had been conf iscate
d
, 
wh a
t can they possibly do to help. Obviously he wasn't able to give an affidavit toanybody 
because there was nom oney.

--
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
He couldn't guarantee theirf inancial
 
--
 
theirf inances.  So he took the 
next bus to New York for the gentlem an who gave us an affidavit.  A little bitof  background, his 
father had gone tom y great grandf ather in1905 saying that heurgently needsI think
 
$3,000 
or
 
$5,000, which is a very substantialamount of m oney for a week. Because he was in 
trouble.  Henever heard from  hisfather again.  He took thatm oney,cam e tothe United States 
to establish him self .
  
He did give m y father the visa, but when he cam ebackhe said," I can't 
take any
 
m o re
 
responsibility."   Obviously 
t h is wa s 
t
oo close.  He turned itdown.  W e weren't

able to do anything to help.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And just toour audience's sake, thatparticular night that your parents were at 
them ovie, you were hom e and got the call.

I was home. I got thecall.  That was the longest hour I couldever

They came back at about
 
10:00. That's when we got all the details.

Frank,
 
several other things I'd lovef or you to tell us about before weclose ina little 
while. W e still have som etim e.  You,of  course, as you said, were able to bring some 
belongings out of Germ any that you hadtopay 100% tax on it. One of those items was
 
a 
bicycle. W ill you tell us about theunpackingof  the bicycle? 
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
My parents hadf riends

at thispoint I'll say acquaintances.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthat tim ef riends.
 
>> F r a n k  
Lieberm ann:
  
W ho hada bicycle and motorcycle shop. T hey said, you know, it would 
probably be
 
helpful if  we put them

packed.  And when we got to the United States, we got a letter.  I don't know exactly at wh at 
t im e
 
but when they knew that we had ourdate and address. T hey said that when youunpack

ﬂ  
 
My f ather was livid.  It was well packed. There were black cloths over it.  But that 
couldhave costm e and m y mother our lives for a lousyf ew gold pieces.

He moved to Dayton because there were noJewish ear, nose, throat 
surgeons.  It was a recomm endationof  a schoolf riend who lived in Cleveland, by the way, and 
had an off ice

shared anoff ice with an ear,nose, throat surgeon. So he was pretty anxious 
to get us out of town.  But it was a very good m ove

Doctor, do you

He came over tohis office

By the way, in

practically doubled in size during that tim e.They didn't wantany doctors over 40and were 
lookingf or younger men.  There was a severe shortageof  doctors. But he did volunteer twice

when he learned about what happenedonKristallnacht, he went toNew York to try to seeif he

two of m y m other's brothers got visas for Shanghaiand

Shanghai, occ

were on the shiponthe day that Italy declared war on England andFrance after thefall of the

I didf inally get closure.  TheGermans keptmeticulous records

I've m ade peace with Germ any.  I rem em ber one

it's th re e

wrong, but Germany is probably owned uptothe Holocaust better than any other country in 
Europe, possibly with exception of Denmark.  
 
 
So I decided

I wenthiking with m y grandchildren
 
last year. I hadgone

oh, about 
12 years ago, 
G liwic e
, the town created am em orial to the contribution of the Jewish 
comm unity to the growth of the city.  Because thePols were trying to recreate their history.  
Coal was discovered in that area. It w
a s o
wned really by the gentries during that tim e. T hat 
area was kindof  a no
-
m an's land partly belonging to Germany andto Poland.  So the land of  
gentry
 
didn't want to get their hands
d
irty and leased the land to entrepreneurs, a large num ber 
of  whom  were Jewish who started the coalmines 
and 
the industrialhubof  Silesia. W e were 
invited by the city of  
G liwic e
 
for the opening of the memorial, which,by the way, had the

I know the house 
even though the streetnames are all different, streetnum bers are different.  I couldn't go near
