Interview with Walter Lachman 
July 31, 1992 
 
Q: It™s July 31, and my na me is Kevin 
Wayne, with the United States Holocaust 
Museum.  I am here with Walter Lachman, 
a Berlin survivor of the Holocaust and 
we are going to interview hi m and discu
ss some  of his experiences during World 
War II.  And we can start very basically with some  demographic information, 

your name  and if your name  was different at
 the time, to mention that as well as 
your date of birth a
nd place of birth   
 

A: I was born Wolfgang, I guess after Mozart, Louis Lachma n on May 26, 1928 in 
Berlin.  My father was Max Lachman 
who was born in the year 1900, also in 
Berlin.  He was the son of Louis Lach
ma n and Anna Lachma n and by profession 
was an engineer.  He had gone to the 
University of Berlin and become  an 
engineer.  My mother was Frieda Schwar
tz whose father was Gustav Schwartz 
and Recha Schwartz was her mother and wa
s also born in Berlin and they were 
the proprietors of a wholesale handker
chief and kerchief business.  My 
grandfather served in the first World Wa
r as a ma ster se rgeant and served in 
various theaters of war -- most notably in
 the French campaigns in Verdun and so 
on and so forth.  My father joined the German army in 1918 just before the war 

ended.  Whi l e he never saw service in the 
first world war, he was very active in 
what was the campaign by the German army against the Spartacus uprising -- this 

was an uprising led by Ka rl Lebclech of 
basically communist agitators and it was 
put down in 1919, Lebclech was killed.  My 
father fought in th
at – against these 
Spartacus revolutiona ries and received the Ir
on Cross, second class for hi s efforts.  
My father married in probably 19– I™m not sure, probably 1926 or 1925 uh – 
for various reasons, personal and to hi
mself, he chose not to pursue his 
engineering career any further and entere
d my grandfather™s business to work 
along with him.    
 
Q: What kind of engineering was he involved with before that? 

 

A: He was a mechanical engineer.  My grandfather™s business wa s apparently a very 
thrivi ng .. uh .. place.  After I was born in 1928, I reme mber being there and 

seeing lots of things being shipped out.
  Big boxes and big storage rooms -- as it 
turned out, when I was first born, we  lived
 in the same building that  the business 
was in.  The business was on the ground floor and we lived on -- it was an 

apartment house and we lived in an apar
tment.  I guess on the third floor above 
that.  Afterwards we moved to what 
was presumably a better building in the 

western section of Berlin which is now 
-- what was until recently, the American 
or the We stern zone of Berlin.  The busi
ness had originally been what was East 
Berlin.  Um -- I had always led a very
 sheltered, quite comfortable childhood.  
Generally, we had the apartment in the cit
y, we also had a fairly small, little 
summer house outside  of Berlin in a place 
called Neuenhagen -- it™s really like a 
little suburb outside of the 
city, and we used to go there for weekends when we 
weren™t away.  As a general rule, my pare
nts uh .. my mother and my father and 

my grandmother, went on a vacation every 
summer.  My father stayed with us for 
the first week -- we would go to Italy 
or Switzerland or Cz
echoslovakia -- Marin 
Bada Kalspark ??  sticks in my mi nd or Ca
ntina in Ital y and my  fa ther stayed with 

us for the first week and at the end of th
e summer  he came and picked us up, so he 
spent a week with us sort of at eith
er end of the vacation.  I don™t know how 

important it is to this whole narrativ
e, but it will tell you some thing about my 
background. 
 

Q: Did you have any br
others or sisters? 
 

A: No.  I was an only child, from I was 
told later, I was born by Caesarean section 
and in those days, wome n c
hose not to have any more children if they had one by 

Caesarean section.  I .. at least that is
 what I was told, I don™t know how factual 
that is.  Uh .. I like to get to my scho
oling now.  I started going to school -- I 
believe in 1933 -- it was just about the time that Hitler came to power and I 

started going to a public school -- I reme
mber having to sing the German anthem 
of course, every morning before class. 
 And also the Nationa l Socialist anthem 

and soon after that, there was a time when 
Ger many agitated for the return of the 
Saar provinces back to Ge rmany and we 
had to sing a special song for the return 
of the Saar -- the coal producing -- the st
eel producing area that had been annexed 
by France -- demilitarized rather . 
 

Q: So you sang these three songs? 

 

A: Sang three songs, and I must say that the 
first two or three years of school really 
proceeding relatively uneventfully -- I can
™t recall that  ther e was any particular 
prejudice or any particular 
hatred or any particular 
problems thatI experienced. 
 

Q: Did you also attend religious school? 

 

A: Not when I was that small.  Later on.  
As far as religion is concerned -- we were 
me mbers of an orthodox congregation that at some  point in time during my 

younger years, my father chose for whatever reason -- my fat her and mother -- I 

suppose it was a joint decision -- chose to jo
in a refor m move me nt and we  went to 
a large -- very elegant refor m synagogue. 
 Maybe that had some thing to do with 
our move to the Western part, I rea
lly don™t know how that came  about but 
whatever -- that is what happened. 
 

Q: Prior to that move, had you b
een living with your grandparents? 
 

A: No.  I skipped that.  My grandfather 
had died probably six months after I was 
born.  He died of tuberculosis and I do not
 remember him at all other than from 
pictur es. 
 

Q: This was your mother™s father? 

 

A: Yes.  That was my mother™s father. 
 And neither do I reme mbe r  my father™s 
father, who had apparently had died 
before I was born.  I do reme mber my 
father™s mother and I do reme mber my mo
ther™s mother.  My father™s mother 
lived near us but we never spent as mu
ch time with her as we spent with my 
mother™s mother.  I don™t know why that is 
but I suppose that is sort of par for the 
course, it happens everywhere.  And uh .. 
my mo ther™s mother really did go along 
on all vacations with us -- a
nd sort of -- while she did not
 live with us --  she lived 
in her own pl ace -- we saw her much more
 frequently.  Every Friday night we 
went to her house for Friday night dinner which for some  traditional reason was 

not chicken but rather wa s roast beef 
-- or whatever -- roast beef and roast 
potatoes or some thing like that.  I am not
 quite sure.  Oh, I would like to talk 

briefl y about my fi rst memories of the Hitler ri se to power and socialism and what 

I overheard in our house.  --  Um .. the first,
 the first real me mory that I have of a 

discussing about Hitler was 
-- or about National Socialists -- was one night when 
we were visiting my uncle -- this was my
 mother™s brother -- who also lived in 

Berlin -- who also had been born in Ber
lin -- but by the way, they did not live too 
far away from where the Reichstag was. 
 We  saw the sky turning red and over the 
radio we heard that there was a fire in th
e Reichstag and at the time, I reme mber a 
conversation that my parents had with my
 uncle about that particular event and 
about how they thought that it probably was 
a staged event and so on and so forth.  
My father was fairly conservative, fairly nationalistic German.  I think now that if 

there is a political equivale
nt in this country now you 
would probably say that he 
was very mu ch a conservative republican a
nd he felt that this – fi rst of all, I 
think – basically I suspect, that while he
 never said so, he probably felt some  
sympathy fo r some of the things that Hitle
r stood for.  Not of course with the 
persecution of the Jews but 
with national pride which my father I believe shared 
and he always – I reme mber one of the th
ings that he always used to say was, 
ﬁ Well, this is an aberration and this 
ma n will me llow and change his mi nd about 
the Jews, particularly the Jews that had 
served Germany in the war and so on and 
so forth, or else he will be  replaced with some one from his party that doesn™t 
believe  in all that nonsense and if it do
esn™t work out, we will leave on the ﬁlast 
trainﬂ.ﬂ Wha t ever that ﬁlast trainﬂ me ant,
 we never caught it.  
We didn™t make that 
last train.  I am trying to 
think back now, I am tr ying to be a little bit – go more a 
little bit in time.  Probabl
y about ™35 or ™36, things 
started changing in Germany 
and Jewish children could no longer attend 
the regular public schools and I had to 
go to what was a Jewish school and th
at school was in the backyard of a 
synagogue in a fairly old building in the ol
der part of town.  
And it was necessary 
for me to either take a subway ---- to take
 an elevator train, or walk. And, I still 

reme mber some of my t eachers and uh -- 
that was not .. I think the school was 

very good.  Uh .. I think I mi ssed some  of 
my friends from the public school but I 
got used to it very quickly and that™s wh
en I started, in addition to having regular 
schooling, I started to have religious inst
ruction also.  Peculiarly enough, even so 
that we belonged then to 
a reformed synagogue, the religious instruction that I 
received was Conservative Judaism -- th
e reform synagogue did not have any 
religious school.  Uh .. I went to that
 school for a couple of years and then, you 
know, I was probably seven, eight years, ni
ne years old and while one is not – 

really does not ..  is not too politically 
cognizant of what is going on. I did hear a 
lot of conversation about Jewish doctors
 being no longer allowed to treat non-
Jewish patients, Jewish attorneys no longe
r being allowed to practice cases, other 
restrictions.  Also, my fa ther complaining that some  of his gentile customers no 
longer would buy from him or were afraid to buy from hi m a nd uh – there was a 

general deterioration in the 
quality of life – not the quality of life so muc h but 
the  economic aspects of life.  As far as 
I can recall, the quality
 of our life really 
continued pretty much as it had before
.  We  continued to take our summer  
vacations, we continue d to go to our 
summer house in Neunehagen, my parents 
continued to go to concerts and to the ope
ra and when I reached this age, they 
took me  onc e in a while and all those 
things were opened up to us and we 
continued to have a – I believe an auto
mobile and I believe there came a time 
when we could no longer drive the automobile because Jews could no longer 

drive pl easur e vehicles, and my father ha
d to sell it and was 
pretty disgruntled 
about that.  But meanwhile, he ke pt sa yi
ng, ﬁWell this will go away and this will 
blow over and this is just temporaryﬂ a
nd his business was still fairly good so he 
wasn™t complaining.  So things pretty much continued. 
 

Q: Did he take over that business?   Wa s it pretty much – 

 

A: Yes, he was really running the business. 
 Since my grandfather 
died, he was really 
running the business.  He  was doing it.  
Maybe this was rea
lly – for all I know, 
he mi ght have gone in the business because
 my grandfather was sick or was dying 

or something like that – that there woul
d be continuity for the business -- that 
mi ght have very well been the reason.  Um – when I left grammar school, which 

was probably around 1937 or 1938, I don™t reme
mber exactly anymore, we had to 
go to a different school -- what was known as an upper school -- a Gymnasium 

kind of thing -- but it was not called a Gymnasium because there were not 

supposed to be Jewish Gymnasium.  It
 was called Jude Schule Nacht Liebplan 
und UberSchule  -- UberSchule meaning an upper school kind of a thing.  And 
that was in the We stern part of the city.  
And I really believe that this is when I 
had my first, first personal contact wi
th prejudice because for some  reason or 
other, there were a lot of young kids, 
non-Jewish young kids who would wait for 
us in order to harass us and beat us up
 on the way to school and there was just 
really almost no escaping it 
and every day it was a challe
nge to try and devise a 
way to go to school a little diffe
rent -- different 
street, different side of the street 
or get off at a different elev
ator stop -- to try to avoi
d that.  And very often we 
were successful, very often we were not.  Most of the time, I had to go alone 

because where I lived there was no other 
kid that was going to that school and it 
became a daily challenge and I really reme
mber being afraid every day to go to 
school and crying to my mother that I don™t 
want to go and I™m afraid and this and 
that and the other thing and my parents 
said you have to go, you have to go to 
school.  I really don™t
 know why my parent
s didn™t accompany me  to school but I 
suppose you can™t do that every day anyway
s.  But somehow, I made school every 
day. I mean, nobody really got hurt serious
ly, we would just get knocked around a 
little bit -- but I was af
raid of it.  I wa s never really 
strong or a very athletic child.  

In fact my parents tried to encourage th
at aspect in me  and had me  join the 
Maccabean soccer league and I had boxing le
ssons and stuff like that which I was 
never really good at.  I wa s just as bad 
at my piano lessons, I was never any good 
at that either.  In any event, that became  a problem.  Then came the Kristallnacht 
on Nove mb er 9, 1938, and at that time, my
 father™s business was all smeared up 
on the outside with ﬁJewish Storeﬂ kind of 
a thing.  Even so, it wasn™t really a 
store -- it was a wholesale bus
iness -- people couldn™t really
 go in and buy.  It was 
painted with big letters and people we
re standing outside and discouraging 

customers from going in. Many of the 
synagogues were burned down -- in fact, 
most of them.  And that was a turni
ng point in the general prosecution er .. 
persecution of the Jews. It 
really, from then on, ever
ybody™s life sort of became 
mi serable who was still left. 
 

Q: Was your school vandalized? 

 

A: No.  The school was not vandalized -- 
the school was fine.  There was no problem 
with the school.  Uh .. 
 

Q: Did your father go to 
work and open the store? 
 

A: My father, yeah, my father went to wor
k.  I think he probably 
closed for a day or 
two but he still had one or two non-Jewish
 employees who stayed really with him 
until the end and in fact, I had been corre
sponding with one of them soon after the 
war and I sent him some  food packages wh
en I was in Munich
 after the war but 
– I lost track of hi m and of course he ha
s to have been dead for ma ny years now.  
And uh – my whole life started 
to change after Nove mber 9
th
.  First of all, that 
summer -- my mother -- we had been on vacation, I believe in the Hartz 

Mountains which are mountains in lo
wer Saxony and my mother became ill, 
while we were on vacation and she had to be brought back in an ambulance.  I 

reme mber that.  I guess it was some  s ort of
 bleeding if one sort or another and she 
died soon the after of Leukemi a. 
 

Q: The summer before Kristallnacht? 

 

A: That was the summer of 1939, so it was real
ly a sort of double wha mmy t hat year.  
First my mo ther dying and then Kristall
nacht was that November.  My father -- 
soon after, my father became ill or at least di
d not feel well.  I th
ink that a lot of it 
had to do with -- probably a lot of it had to
 do with my mother™s dying -- it had to 
do with the deterioration of the busin
ess -- the general hopelessness if the 
situation and he still kept 
saying ﬁThis won™t last -- this
 won™t last.ﬂ But then he 
started, I believe, trying to 
get us out of the country. 
 But after 1939, it was really 
quite difficult -- the European countries 
like Fr ance and Britain would not take uh 
.. Jewish refugees at that time.  For th
e United States, you had to have a relative 
who guaranteed your financial support.  We  knew nobody here so that wa s 

impossible.  My father made some  tent
ative tries to get to a South American 

country and I will tell you more about that later.  I think he  made some  contacts in 
Chile and I think some  work was done 
along those lines, hoping to get to Chile. 
 

Q: Was your father ever taken for forced labor? 

 

A: No.  He was  not.  He was never in an
y concentration camp, he was never in any 
forced labor -- he was never really hurt 
in any way.  Uh – my father, I reme mber 
living of course with my father and we  sti
ll had a maid, or a servant in those days.  

That was a problem too, I believe that s
ooner or later, we weren™t allowed any 
more to have  a non-Jewish servant living in the household so I think she became a 

day person who would come  in.  My fath
er became  ill and died on December 19, 
1940 of tuberculosis.  Tuberculosis wa s the
n, still a very dread 
disease.  Today of 
course, it has been eradicated -- or ma ybe
 it™s comi ng to the fore again -- I don™t 
know.  But in any event, people would die 
of tuberculosis a
nd people would talk 
of tuberculosis like we talk of cancer today. 
 

Q: Do you recall him being ill in the house? 

 

A: Yes, I recall him being ill and I recall him coughing and I recall him going to the 
hospital and I recall visiting him.  Of course, you couldn™t go to the regular 

hospital, you had to go to the Jewish hospita
l --  he went to the Jewish hospital in 
Berlin and di ed in that hospital.  Af
ter my father had died, my grandmother 

liquidated their apartment and I moved in w
ith her.  That™s my mother™s mother.  
My father™s mother had died in between 
some where -- some where along the line -
- probably I would say 1935 or 1936, some wher
e along that line.  But as I said 

earlier, we weren™t really 
that close to her.  So from 1940, after December 1940, I  
moved in with my grandmother and move
d in with her.  I reme mber my Bar 
Mitzvah -- which was a very small affair 
-- but I did have a 
Bar Mitzvah -- and I 
guess because of my grandmother, it wa
s in an orthodox synagogue.  But it was a 
very small thing in our apartment afterw
ards with some  people comi ng over.  
Nobody could have big fe stivit
ies any more -- you couldn™
t go to restaurants any 
more and you couldn™t go to concerts 
any more.  My grandmother wasn™t 
involved in that kind of thing anyhow -- all 
that stuff after my mother died.  Uh .. 
I continued with my schooling while I liv
e with my grandmother and we received 
a notice in January 1942 to report for re
settleme nt on let™s say on about the 20
th
 of 
that month.  I can™t be sure of
 the correct date, but around the 20
th
 or 21
st
 of 
January 1942.  We  reported to a very la
rge -- one of the few s ynagogues that had 
been left standing. 
 

Q: That™s where you were told to report? 

 

A: That™s where we were told to report.
  One of the few synagogues that had been 
left standing and they cleared out all 
the benches and chairs and everybody was 
on blankets -- sitting on blankets on the 
floor and slept there for a day or two 
while we were being registered.  We  we
re allowed to bring, I think one suitcase 
each and uh .. I reme mbe r  my grandmothe r had me put on double clot hing -- two 

pairs of pants and two shir
ts and things like that a
nd she took a hundred mark note 
and wrapped it up -- wrapped a yarn around 
it so it would look like some  extra 
sewing ma terial and gave me  that to keep in my pocket which turned out to ma ke 
no sense at all but you know, those are 
things that people do when they don™t 
know where they are going. 
 

Q: Did you pack some thing special? 

 

A: No, my grandmother did th
e packing.  Incidentally -- 
while I was living with my 
grandmother, she was pursuing this uh – 
this Chilean trip or immi gration and 

nothing ultima tely came  of it.  I reme mber
 even taking lessons because uh .. to 
learn how to ma ke ma rzipan so that she 
would be able to have some thing that you 
can ma ke a living in if she came to anothe
r country and I would help her do that 
some how, it never came out too well wh
en I did it.  We  practiced cooking 
ma rzipan in the house so that we would ha
ve some thing professi
onal or a trade if 
we ever got to Chile but obviously, nothing 
ever came of it so as we received our 
notice in 1942, we registered and there 
were probably about a thousand people 
and they would -- as I read now, -- they 
would .. each of the transports would be 
about a thousand people would be
 put .. would be sent away. 
 

Q; How did this notification come  to you? 

 

A: It came in the mail. 

 

Q: Just in the mail? 

 
A: It came in the ma il.  My grandmothe
r, amazingly enough, did an inventory of all 
our househol d goods that we had to leave 
and I still have the inventory so I am 
trying to collect from the German govern
me nt for that but who knows?   Whatever 
-- whether anything will come  of that or
 not.  Maybe nothing ever will.  It™s 
amazing to see all these things -- she wa
s very me ticulous, I mean even to the 
extent of phonograph records as to how ma
ny we re left behind and so on and so 
forth. 
 
Q: How much l eave time  did you have? 

 

A: We had about – I would say it was about 
a week, ten days.  That™s really all we 
had.  And we couldn™t take very much so you didn™t need much lead time -- I 

believe the suitcase could weigh no more than 30 kgs which is about 60 pounds -- 

it is less than we usually take on a vacation 
trip now -- so you really couldn™t take 
very much.  It turns out la
ter on that we lost everythi
ng anyway so it doesn™t ma ke 
a difference -- the whole thi
ng was academic.  Um – my last me mories of Berlin 
uh .. were that, as we were leaving th
e synagogue, my – the principal of my – 
of the high school that I had gone to was 
standing at the exit point and gave each 
person a hard candy and he said goodbye 
to me  and I was surprised that he 
reme mbered me  and then we were put 
on a truck -- an open truck and the last 

sight that I reme mber of Ber
lin is that victory column th
at site in the mi ddle of the 
Tiergarten, it™s just a monume nt -- nothi
ng really special -- 
I believe it reme mbers 
-- it comme morates a victory in the wa
r of 1870-71 against the French.  Um – 
we were brought to a railroad yard 
and uh – in freight cars -- you know, in 
regular freight cars – and they were lock
ed and we started ou
r journey.  Many of 
the people, I reme mber, were fairly old -- 
I was the only child in that particular 
car -- the only youngster.  I must have been
 about fourteen -- about thirteen and a 
half years old.  It was soon after my Bar 
Mitzvah.  My Bar Mitzvah had been in 
May 1941 -- June 1941, so this must have been like since months after my Bar 

Mitzvah.  And uh .. there were pails for toilet needs which were emptied from 

time to time -- the journey took, I believe,
 about seven or eight days.  It was 
getting colder, the food was 
relatively inadequate -- this was in the mi ddle of 
winter -- this was in January and we were
 headed East so obviously freight cars 
have no heating facilities -- 
but there were enough of us 
in the car so there was a 
certain amount of human warmth. 
 

Q: You were with your grandmother? 

 

A: I was still with my grandmother and inci
dentally, while we were at the gathering 
point of the synagogue, I reme mber seeing my  first person dying -- which is really 

sort of indelible in my mi nd -- I saw ma
ny, many more after th
at but there was a 
ma n on one of those blankets near us a
nd all of a sudden, he started -- well, I 
guess he had a heart attack and just di
ed.  I mean, nobody did anything to him -- 

he just died and that sort 
of stuck in my mi nd -- I had never seen that before and it 
was sort of a frightening thing to 
a thirteen and a half year old. 
 
Q For your mo ther and father when they pa
ssed away, was it still possible to have a 
norma l fune ral service? 
 
A Yes, it was.  There was a norma l .. you know
 there is a Jewish cemetery in Berlin 
and one of the peculiarities of the Germ
an Jewish community was there wa s one 
very large cemetery which cater ed to all 
the different religious -- religious Jewish 
denominations so it is a very gigant ic pl
ace -- it™s still in exis
tence -- I have been 
back there two or three time s and it is a 
very lovely, peaceful place.  And there is 
a very large family plot that accommodate
s both my mother and my father, my 
grandfather, my mother™s brother, who di
ed also of asthma  probably some where 
in the 30™s --  that  plot is still ther
e. O.K. -- how are we doing with the tape? 
 

Q: We™reO.K. 

 

A: O.K., we are on the cattle car -- or freight
 car or whatever you want to call that 
thing.  A number of people in the car di
ed, but after you see 
your first person 
dying, you sort of become immune to that. 
 

Q: Did you pass those bodies out at certain points or – 

 

A: No. They left them.  They left them until we got to where we were going.  As it 
turned out, we arrived in Riga, which wa
s then the capitol of Latvia and uh .. we 
– as we got off the cattle cars or  freight
 cars -- it was very co
ld, and there was a 
great deal of snow which was higher than 
I had ever seen it and we were told to 
put our luggage on sleds which were waiti
ng nearby -- the sleds -- I think they had 
horses -- and we put the luggage on those 
sleds and I guess that
 was the last we 
saw of the m.  That was the end of that
.  Where they took it, we™ll never know -- 
but it was gone.  We  were then put on ot
her trucks and were driven to what had 
been the ghetto in Latvia -- 
I mean I know all this, but of
 course we didn™t realize 
this when we went there but I knew that 
subsequently.  Apparently, from what I 
know now, that had been the se
ction of the city that had 
been a closed ghetto for 
the Latvian Jews who in December of 
1941, had all been taken to the surrounding 
forest and killed and uh – we went into 
those apartments and uh – and were told 
to ma ke yourself at home -- you decide wher
e you want to be.  Of course, there 

was very little room -- generally about 
three or four people, some ti me s five 
people to each room -- kitchens being included as a room. 
 

Q: The Riga 377 ?  was an enclosed ghetto? 
 

A: It was a closed ghetto, not an open ghe
tto.  You know apparently in those days, 
from what I know now, there were open
 ghettos where people could come  and go 
as they wished and there were closed
 ghettos where there were fences around 
them and you had to pass a gate and you 
could only go out in order to work and 
that was for a specific work purpose -- 
you could not go out.  Riga had been -- 
had always been a closed 
ghetto from the beginning. 
 
Q: So they brought you in the ghetto
 and they said ﬁFind a placeﬂ? 
 
A: They brought us to – they would count 
out a hundred people and say ﬁHere is a 
building, this is it -- go to it.ﬂ And it 
was amazing, in some places, there was still 
food on the table, of course everything 
was cold -- there were no in apartment 
toilets -- it ha d been a very poor part of
 the city.  But there were toilets on each 
floor but because it had been left unattende
d for month or six weeks, all the toilet 
facilities were frozen and that became a 
real problem I reme mber during the first 
few months.  Because, as you know, nothing unfreezes, it neve r gets above 

freezing -- so it was really a – that was one 
of our little problems.  Uh – we sort 
of – we didn™t know what to do for the first few days, nobody really paid any 

attention to us -- they woul
d give us food,  they brought it around in kettles -- in 
community kitchens and what have you, 
but – I would say that probably for the 
beginning, the food was fairly ad
equate, there was enough of it. 
 

Q: So you would go outside to – 

 

A: Yeah.  We  would go outside to get the food. 

 

Q: Was there some  type of Jewish council? 

 
A: There was nothing at the beginning.  All 
these things for med as we stayed there 
for a while.  First of all, the biggest tr
auma  that I experienced probably in my 
entire concentration camp life, was during 
the fi rst two weeks 
of it and during the 
last three months of it.  So let me  go into
 the fi rst two weeks of it so that  I can tell 
you best as to what I recall best about it.
  As I said, I was with my grandmother 
who was in those days, probably in her 
early sixties and uh – if I reme mb er 
correctly, fairly old looking.  
It really fits th
e ima ge -- she had gray hair and she 
was a little lady, maybe a li
ttle on the heavy side, not 
too – but maybe a little on 
the heavy side.  We  were together in 
a kitchen with two other people, with a 
single woma n and a single ma n.  I don™t reme mbe r  exactly how we slept -- all I 

reme mber is that nobody really had any pur
pose.  I mean, everything was aiml ess, 
we just would -- I would -- you know being 
a thirteen and a half year old kid, I 
was kind of curious and I would walk
 around and scavenge around and look for 
things and try to get into building that were
 not -- that were not occupied which of 
course you weren™t supposed to do, but I 
really hadn™t quite 
gotten used to the 
idea of imprisonment yet.  Uh .. I would say 
that about the fourth
 or fifth day that 
we were there, when we went out to ge
t our meal, they asked us for volunteers to 
help to sort clothes ad I sa
id to my grandmother, ﬁI th
ink I™d like to goﬂ and she 
said, no, don™t go and I said ﬁyeah, I want to
 do this.  I have nothing to do.ﬂ  So I 
did, and I reme mber that they brought us 
into a big hall and we  had to sort.  
Apparently those were the clothes of the 
Latvian Jews which we of course didn™t 
know.  And we had to put sweaters with sw
eaters and pants with pants -- stuff like 
that.  I mean, something that a thirteen
 and a half year old could easily do. 
 

Q: Were there other childre
n there, that you recall? 
 

A: Not really.  By that .. you know, the la
st few years, the only time  I really saw 
children was at school.  I mean, there wa
s no way that you could play with other 
children, you know that – and 
I really would spend more 
time with adults than I 
would spend with children anyways.  So uh – 
 

Q: How long did the sorting go on? 

 

A: Oh, that was just a day.  It was just
 a day™s job, it wasn™t
 a big deal.  And you 
know, when I made my way back, to this
 kitchen where we were living but my 
grandmother wasn™t there and uh – I asked for her but nobody knew where she 

was.  And then it turned out that a numb
er of the older people had been taken 
away.  And apparently the first, I know 
now – but as far as I was concerned, she 
had just disappeared.  But we know now
 that the Germans in Latvia first 
experime nted with those trucks whereby 
they would direct the exhaust into the 
truck and uh .. while they were driving 
the people would suffocate and then they 
would just unload them and – you know, go for the next load.  Of course, later 

on, that turned out to be a very tedious 
and slow process and 
they couldn™t handle 
very ma ny people.  They could only take lik
e twenty or thirty people in each truck 
and there wasn™t really an efficient way for the Germans to do the job so they 

subsequently abandoned that me thod and us
ed the shower rooms and what have 
you.  So uh .. the first few days without my grandmother were really an extremely 
difficult time for me  because I had always
 been a sheltered kid, had always  been 
with adults, had always been with my fa
mily and uh .. it was really very trauma tic 
-- to be all of a sudden by yourself and to 
– it wa s a mi xture of feeling lonely and 

feeling afraid and feeling scared and uh .. 
I wasn™t really as much worried about 
my life as I was just at a loss about wh
at happens now?  Whe r e do I go?   Who is 
going to take care of me ?   And the realizat
ion that I would have to take care of 
myself or I wouldn™t exist.  I continued liv
ing in that kitchen with these two single 
people for a – for some time.  I reme
mber sleeping on the floor while they 
shared a be d.  They turned out .. they became lovers later on which amazingly 

enough that people would think about thos
e kind of things in the ghetto but I 
guess, love is a pretty powerful in
fluence, it comes right after food. 
 

Q: Was this kitchen heated at all? 

 

A: Yes, there wa s heat.  There was heat a
nd there was, really I must say, there was 
heat and from what I can recollect, ther
e was really adequate food.  We  were not 
starved.  There was never really 
like a whole lot but there was enough. 
 

Q: Twice a day you would get food? 

 

A: Yeah, twice a day we would get food a
nd I continued working sorting the clothes 
-- I continued doing that and uh .. we work
ed no more than eight hours so it was a 
relatively normal workday.  Most of the work
 that I did was done in the ghetto but 
I know that there were other groups that 
assembled -- there was a large square in 
the ghetto -- that assemb led, and they were
 ma rched out of the ghetto to do work. 
 

Q: As a young boy, what was your impression of the S.S. or the guards? 

 

A: Well, you know, one of the overriding a
nd important thoughts that you have is 
that you worry about nothing other than 
keeping yourself alive and you go from 
day to day and that impulse 
intensifies, becomes more 
important.  You hide from 
those that you feel can hurt you, you are 
anxious not to shar
e anything that you 
have with those that are with you.  Ther
e are stories now about ma ny friendships 
having formed in the ghettos and in th
e concentration camps.  I have never 
experienced that and as far as I am con
cerned, I was very selfish and very self-
contained.  I was never able to get an a
dvantage in any way whereby I could work 
a little less or get a 
little extra food, I was very anxious
 to preserve that for myself 
and not tell anybody else about it and so, 
if anything, that mentality was probably 
one of the ugliest  aspects of our im
prisonment because we became totally 
oblivious to those around us -- some times
 to the extent that if you saw some body 
who was being kicked or beaten or abused or killed or hanged -- one of the 

feelings that would come to your mi nd fi
rst was boy, am I glad it™s not me .  And 
rather than feeling sorry for the first that
 this was being done 
to, and I think this 

was one of the, one of the dehumanizing 
and ugliest aspects of the whole – of 
that whole situation.  So, let me  go back to the kitchen. 
 
Q: Do you recall the couple™s name s? 

 

A: I recall their last name s.  It happene
d to be Levy in both instances.  He was 
Hermann Le vy I believe but I don™t know what her name  was.  I mean .. there 

were .. again, we were .. we really lived 
along side  each othe r not with each other.  

We didn™t share anything and we talked but
 it wasn™t – it wa s just like strangers 
talking at a bus stop, that kind of thing.  
We  really lived, just happened to be in 
the same  place.  After – the ghetto life sort of norma lized itself if you can speak 

of such a thing.  There was a council of el
ders that had been formed and there was 
a ghetto hospital and there was even, w
ould you believe, a synagogue -- that was 
not a synagogue, per se but there were 
services being held in some body™s room 
and uh .. whenever I could, I started going 
to services -- which were not well 
attended incidentally -- uh .. from what
 I understand, the hospital in the ghetto 
performe d a bortions because childr
en were not allowed to be born. 
 

Q: Some  woma n :  Excuse me , were there 
mostly Germans in the ghettos at  this 
point? 
 

A: Yes, at that point there were mostly
 Germans and a few Latvian Jews and some  
Czechoslovakian Jews.  In fact, we lived in buildings .. the build
ing that I lived in 
was a Berlin building and then ther e wa
s a Ha mb urg building and so on and so 
forth and there was a group from Col ogne 
and various parts of Ger many.  One of 
the ladi es who lived in the building became 
the secretary to one of the elders -- 
the Jewish elders -- Alteste Rat as it wa
s called.  And through her, I became  .. I 
got a job as a me ssenger for the Alteste 
Rat, of course there was no phone so 
when me ssages had to be brought from one
 place to another, some body had to 
carry them and she arranged for me  to have that job.  And uh .. I did that for 

probably, I would say a year.  Then that su
mmer, it petered out and I went back to 
sorting clothes and uh .. subsequently, I ha
d gotten a little bit stronger and quite a 
bit leaner -- I had been a fat kid and I lo
st most of that -- so one of the guards 
noticed me  and I was sent to a – I went
 on a fairly extended 
trip, cutting lumber 
in what was then Russia in a  place ca
lled the Germans call it Pleskau, P-L-E-S-

K-A-U, the Russian name  today is Pskov  
P-s-k-o-v.  And we were probably there 

for a .. oh, I would say a week or 
two weeks or some thing like that. 
 

Q: You were transported out of the ghetto .. 

 

A: Transported out of the ghetto to that
 pl ace, cutting down trees, which I had never 
done before -- but that wa s all right.  
We .. we lived in abandoned farmhouse I 
reme mber.  We also -- I was also put
 on -- they call Commando -- to a pl ace 
called Rzekne and while I was there, I wa
s – I came  in contact with Boleslav 
Michovsky who has become  fairly well known 
in this country because he was the 
carpent er in Minneola that was accused of 
the war crimes -- as a war criminal and 

then I guess he lost -- was stripped of 
his citizenship and was supposed to be 
deported and he is now on trial in Ge rmany 
for his crimes.  Probably now he is in 
his eighties so he will probably never – ne
ver make it but in any event, that .. 
that became a fairly celebrated case. 
 

 End of Side A. 

 Start again at 000 on Side B.  

 

A: O.K.  

 

Q: What did you do on that commando? 

 

A: I think we also did lumber, we also did wood. 

 

Q: Did everyone survive those commandos? 

 

A: Yeah, you know I haven™t really spoken 
much about guards about suffering per se 
because, there really, in all fairness to th
e Germans, we didn™t have much contact 
with the guards. There we re very few S.
S. me n or guards in 
the ghetto -- I mean 
we were just sort of like in a steam cooker -- we we re left to cook by ourselves.  

There were obviously people -- guards at
 the gates uh – I don™t reme mber any 
specific acts of cruelty or harassme nt in
 the ghetto.  There were at work, if we 
didn™t work fast enough, they would kick us
 or prod us with a shovel or rifle or 
some thing like that but it really wasn™t 
the real gruesome  things that you hear 
about --those really all came later and in the various concentration camps.  Uh – 

I am going to try to put this in a proper time  fra me now.  I stayed in the ghetto 
probably from the beginning of Februa
ry 1942 until uh – late in 1943 or ma ybe 
even the beginning of ™44 and uh .. no, no, it wasn™t that long -- excuse me, I™m 

sorry.  It was from the beginning of ™
42 until probably early ™43.  Then the 
Germans we re beginning to liquidate th
e ghettos and were mo ving people into 
labor camps and concentration camps.  Uh 
.. I would say it was some where in ™43, 
early ™43, maybe mi ddle of ™43.  It seems 
to me  t hat it was either spring or 
summer, that the spring and summer  in Ru
ssia are very short and don™t last long.  
Uh – we were brought from the ghe
tto to a concentration camp called 
Kaiserwald, and from there, where we rea
lly st ayed a relatively short time, and 
then were brought to a factory in Riga 
that specialized in
 receiving, sorting, 
cleaning and rehabilitating uniforms for th
e German army from the front -- it was 
called ABA 701 -- ABA standing for Ar
mee Bekleidung Amt ( Mr. Lachma n 
spells these words out ) Amt being bureau. 
 And there we had much more contact 
with the guards and there was a great deal
 more harassment and a great deal more 
supervision and of course that was begi
nning to be real concentration camp like 

where instead of, this was a big old fact
ory building -- it was 
a factory that had 
ma nufactured blue color, blue dye and everything in that place was still blue -- I 

reme mber that like it was yesterday -- 
it was called Riga Ultramarine, they had 
made artificial, I guess, ar tificial bl ue color. 
 

Q: What was your job there? 
 

A: Sorting.  Just sorting and I was .. I wa
s some how – I stayed with that sorting 
stuff, I don™t know why.  Maybe I became a 
specialist -- I don™t know  (laughs).  
But there we were constantly supervis
ed by the S.S. people and constantly 
harassed and constantly kicked and c
onstantly you know – annoyed.  And uh – 
we slept in the typical concentration 
camp arrangement where there were like – 
they weren™t beds – they were like big pl
atforms, one on top of the other, three 
high or four high.  Every
body would lie in the – on the platform and it was so 
crowded that you know, you couldn™t really tu
rn.  You had to lie on your side and 
of course, men were separated from wo
me n in that situation.  There were 

communal baths and it was really like 
a concentration camp arrangeme nt.  
Incident ally, let me go back to the ghetto
 for a mi nute.  Uh .. from time to time, 
people would try to escape from the ghetto 
and as they were ca
ught they would be 
brought back and hanged and everybody woul
d have to ma rch by in the morning 
and they would generally leave hanging th
ere for, especially in the winter time 
when everything froze, some times four or 
six weeks just sort of as a me mento so 
that everybody could see it every day and 
I guess that was supposed to discourage 
us from running away.  I must tell you th
at I really never had any thoughts about 
running away or anythi ng like that because
 I coul dn™t envision myself – I had a 

difficult time enough getting along -- I had no 
contacts.  I didn™t speak Latvian -- I 
only spoke German.  I mean there was ju
st no way.  Also our hair was cropped 

close and through the mi ddle we had a shav
en strip that was re-shaven probably 
every two or three weeks so – and the wome n we re completely shaven.  Their 

heads were completely shaven so you 
would stand out from t he population.  I 
don™t know how people – I guess some  pe
ople did get away -- you know, not 
many but I guess some people did.  I mean there are many recorded instances 

known of pe ople who actually ran away 
from .. especially from ghettos and 
joining partisans or undergrounds or what
 have you.  I don™t know that there was 
much of an underground in Latvia because
 the Latvians rea
lly, from everything 
we could see, were really very much pr
o German and very much anti Russian and 
I think the La tvians were probably roo
ting for the Germans to win and uh .. I 
would say that the Latvians were basically
 more --  more the Latvians than the 
Lithuanians-- were probably more, more an
tagonistic towards us than ma ny of the 
Germans were so I coul dn™t envi sion escapi
ng into that element.  Uh – let me  go 
back to where I was -- to the li
ving conditions in that ABA 701.   
 

Q: A quick question? 

 

A: Sure. 

 

Q:  -- You were obviously growing thiswhole time, were you able to find new 
clothing for yourself?   Through your sorti
ng were you able to pull through any – 
 

A: Well, you couldn™t – we ll, 
I™ll tell you -- I did that on
ce and it wasn™t such a 
good thing. Uh – it turned out to be a mi stake.  Uh – well, you know, we had 

uniforms.  We had those blue and white 
striped uniforms.  I ncidentally, for one 
reason or another, amazingly enough, I sti
ll have my unifor m cap.  I still have 
that.  The original uniform cap.   
 
Q: That was once you were in this ABA -- 

 

A: In the ghetto, you wore civilian clothes 
and I don™t know how I ma de out.  I really 
don™t .. you know, it was so long ago, some  of
 that stuff just, just doesn™t stick 
out.  Um .. while I was in that ABA 701, I 
stole a pair of shoes because my shoes 
were just completely gone and uh .. I muddied them up a little bit, you know the 

outsides so that they would look old.  
But of course, you couldn™t disguise that 
and I was found out and uh .. I was calle
d to the commander and first got a good 
beating and then he said, ﬁ Well, I guess 
we will have to execute you.ﬂ  So, I went 

back and I said well, I guess this is it
.  But some where later on, one of the guards 
came back and said ﬁ Well, he™s changed his mi nd, all you have to do ..ﬂ, he gave 

me  an iron bar to carry and I had to 
carry it, you know there was a four floor 
building, I had to carry that bar up and 
down the stairs for 
I don™t know how ma ny 
times .. fifty times, maybe a hundred times -- I don™t know what it was, but that 

was my punishme nt and of course I got 
a pair of wooden shoes which was the 
worst punishment because I had to wear t
hose for the next couple of years and it 
was really hard to walk on them.  But .. 
 

Q: Where did you find t
hose shoes that you took? 
 

A: I took them from the ones, 
all the things that came in, th
e things that I was sorting.  
Uh  .. before long, there wasn™t really a 
whole lot of sorting 
to do, so instead of 
sorting clothes they switched us to loadi
ng and unloading ships, that came into the 
Riga harbor and uh .. that was a lousy job 
because first of all, it was cold and it 

was wet and we then worked twelve hour 
shifts -- you either worked the night 
shift or the day shift and there was really
 no place to hide -- you were outside -- 
and the worst of it all was that the Russian
s used to come  and bomb the harbor all 
the time  and we had really no protection  
-- all you could do was try to get off the 
ship as quickly as you could and you know 
they had these flares that they would 
drop and the sky would be lit up and they had machine gun ships and they – in 

those days, the Russians we were really 
beginning to ma ke substantial progress 
and were moving against the Germans 
-- pretty well down into Russia.  
 

Q: Were these troop ship
s or just cargo ships? 
 

A: Cargo ships -- no troop ships.  We  we
re loading and unloading ammunition.  We  
were loading and unloading 
supplies -- if we were loading supplies, some times 
we would try to steal some  of the food 
if we could and again, anybody that got 
caught really got into serious problems
. Uh .. I reme mber taking a package once 
of some thing and under great personal pe
ril and when I unpacked it, I found out it 
was mustard -- that just goes to show
 you that you never 
know about all those 
things -- so instead of food, I got mu star d.  Um ..I was very 
angry at that time  

because I had taken a tremendous chance to 
do it.  It seems si
lly now but I didn™t 
laugh then. 
 
Q: Your food rations at th
at point had decreased? 
 

A: The food rations at that poi
nt had deteriorated and uh .. 
things were really getting 
tougher every day.  But as long as we c
ould work and I guess we were a pretty 
good working group, they would keep us 
going.  We were concerned because 
especially the ones that were older than 
I could see that the tide of the war was 
turning against the Germans and uh .. they 
were -- they would say, well, gee, what 
are they going to do with us if they have to
 get out of here. ---I 
would like to take 
a mi nute or two and talk about some  of 
the older people who were in the camp 
because, you know, I had uh .. I was young.  I was 14 or 15, 16, whatever age I 

was at that time, I never had the opportuni
ty to acquire any personal dignity if you 
know what that means -- in other words, I 
never had a real position in life where I 
had self respect, where people looked up to
 me , where people felt this is a great 
guy or what have you.  So, probably 
on the whole, the whole ghetto and 
concentration life was easier for me  than 
for some of these people.  I reme mber 
one of the people that worked with us in that ABA 701, had been the chief 

gynecologist in one of the 
leading hospitals in Berli
n.  Now you know, I can just 
imagine what scrounging for food  -- th
e loss of dignity, being kicked around, 
being cursed at -- I sort of took that in st
ride.  I had grown up with it.  I had been 
cursed at on the way to school so you
 kind of become accustomed to it -- you 
don™t like it -- but you figure 
out that™s the way life is. 
 But I wonder how life was 
for those people and it must have been mu
ch more difficult than it was for me  and 
uh .. well, I didn™t have any particular em
pathy for him at that time.  Now I can 
think back, I feel that that 
must have been a degradation to him a great deal worse 
than it was for me .  Uh .. O.K. -- so much about that.  So, let™s get back to the end 

of the German occupation of Riga.  By 
that time , as I said, the Russians were 
raiding us almost every night -- by raidi
ng ﬁusﬂ -- raiding th
e Germans.  And of 
course the Russians didn™t know we were 
there.  In fact, towards the end, the 
Germans we re parking trains -- there wa
s a train track right through that ABA 701 

-- that old factory that we  were at, and th
e Germans were parking trains that were 
loaded with ammunition right along side us
, so we  didn™t care -- it didn™t ma ke 
any difference but they obviously did that
 on purpose.  Uh .. for one reason or 
another, the Germans de cided to keep us 
instead of shooting us which was really, 
really was amazing because in retrospect, I know ma ny people were not as 

fortunate.  The Germans withdrew all th
eir forces in Latvia to a uh .. to a 

bridgehead in Libau -- Ge rman na me , the Latvian name  that it goes by now is 

Liepaja.  It is a port that is
 not on the Gulf of Riga but 
is on the Baltic Sea.  It is 
also in Latvia.  It is really not far from
 Riga.  And they brought us there and that 
was a smaller group.  They took some of th
e people that had worked on that ABA 
701 and brought them back to Kaiserwald or
 Stuthoff near Danzig which is also a 
large concentration camp.  And they t
ook probably 80 of us.  And again, I don™t 
know why .. how I was selected to be part
 of it -- I wasn™t a 
better worker than 
anybody else -- I wasn™t a particularly 
strong or healthy 
individual -- I was 

probably as emaciated as everybody else.  
I think a lot of it wa s God™s providence 
and luck. So I was amongst these eighty 
people that were bro
ught to that place 
Libau or Liepaja and we were housed in 
I guess it had been an old ma nsion -- it 
was near the ocean, on a beautiful st reet --  but there was barbed wire around it.  
We were loading and unloading ships -- mo
stly at that point, we  were not 
unloading anything more -- we were loadi
ng.  The Germans were trying to carry 
back everything that they could carry back.  I reme mber, we were dismantling 

even the tin roofs -- putting th
e sheets of tin in wooden enclosures and they were 

being shipped back to Germany.  The y were
 just stripping the place and we  were 
there for – that must have been late ™
44, that mu st have been, I would say, early 
Fall to late Fall ™44,  and we were there 
for several months doing that particular 
thing.  One of the unfortunate things th
at happened there was that one of the 

Russian bombs hit the building that we were
 in and probably fifteen or so of us 
were killed.  Uh .. which was really too 
bad.  Uh .. again, you don™t feel -- I did 

not feel, particularly sorry for them, I  fe
lt particularly gl ad that  it wasn™t me.  
And, that is one thing that I won™t 
forgive the Germans for -- is that 
dehumanization of people -- of this comple
te destruction of the human spirit and 
of the huma n compassion and you know, that was awful.  It was hard to come  

back and ma ybe you didn™t come  back a
ll the way.  I don™t know, I™m not sure.  

Maybe, I will never be as compassionate of a person as you, I have no idea.  But 

in any event, we were there for a while 
and again, those of us – the older people 
tend to be more concerned with the future
 -- the people of my age really were 

worried with day to day.  ﬁHow a m I goi
ng to have food today?   How can I work 
the least today?  How can I get the best
 night™s sleep?  How can I –? ﬂ That was 

about it.  ﬁHow can I keep my behind 
clear so that nobody kicks me  around? ﬂ  
That kind of thing.  And again, people were
 worried about what will they do with 
us when this is over with.  And again, it 
was perhaps divine providence or perhaps 
luck or whatever, they decided to take
 us back to Germany.  As they were 
evacuating the bridgehead in Libau, they put
 us on a .. a .. in the hold of a ship full 
of freight, by that time we were down to 
about fifty or sixt
y people, and brought 
us back to Germany. 
 

Q: How long was that journey? 

 

A: I would say three or four days. I reme mb
er that there was no 
food on that trip and 
that was kind of gruesome  but at least 
we were getting back.  I think probably 
they didn™t want to leave us
 or didn™t want to leave 
our bodies for the Russians to 
find.  I think really that was probably th
e rationale because I can™t think of any 
other reason why they would take us bac
k, because  by that time, they didn™t need 

us anymore.  By that time, they had no
 more use for our labor because that was 

early ™45 and you know .. the thing had comp
letely disintegrated.  It was either 

December ™44 or January ™45, I don™t know
 which but it was probably December 
™44, by that time , Ger ma ny was in such disa
rray that there was no work to be done 
anymore.  As I said, the last time ..  wh
ile we were in Libau towards the end, we 

were dismantling buildings and shipping them
 back which was really one of those 
nonsense jobs kind of a thing.  There was no reason for it.  What were they going 

to do with sheets of me tal?   You know, there was no need for it any mo re.  Uh – 
I reme mber the ship coming in – of course
 we were in the hold, we couldn™t see 
anything and uh ... when they let us off the ship in Ha mburg, I reme mber terrible 

devastation in the harbor in
 Hamburg.  It really looked .. we were amazed, I mean 

we hadn™t been back to Germany – this 
was Germany that was so destroyed.  Uh 

– and, I really think they didn™t know what 
to do with us when they got us back.  
It was the kind of thing where some body says, ﬁwhat did you bring us here, where 

did you get these guys?  What am I s upposed 
to do with them? ﬂ   That kind of 
thing.  You know.  So uh .. for want of a 
place, they brought us to a jail -- a city 
jail, in Hamburg and they put all of us 
in two cells.  Which was awful crowded 
and uh .. we had just nothing to do for pr
obably .. they kept us there for I would 

say three or four weeks.  We  got very in
adequate food, they did take us out a few 
times and the only thing we did when they
 took us out -- we were collecting shell 
fragments from the anti-aircraft guns that
 had fallen -- you know they were really 
jagged fragme nts.  I don™t know if you have ev
er seen an anti-aircraft shell -- they 
are jagged pi eces of me tal.  You have to be careful when you pick them up 

because they are really sharp in some  
instances and we put them on, in Europe 
they use these trailer trucks that are open 
trailers in the back
 but we no longer had 
trucks because they didn™t 
have any gasoline so we had 
to pull the trailers.  But 
again .. this was a nonsense 
job -- it was really not 
a job that meant anything 
because nothing was going anywhere -- 
nothi ng was functioning anymore.  You 
know .. Germany for all practical purpos
es, really had stopped functioning in 
those days.  Uh .. I suppose, some where 
in the mi ddle or towards the end of 
January, uh .. ma ybe the director of the pr
ison wanted to get rid of us and said ﬁ 
look, take these guys away, I don™t wa nt them hereﬂ or some body said, ﬁWhat do 

we do with these people? ﬂ  So, they put 
us in two small trucks and took us to 
Bergen-Belsen which is not far from Ha mburg.  
 

Q: How long were you in that jail? 

 

A: I would say about a month.  Maybe th
ree weeks.  You know, you lose track of 
time and uh .. even if I did reme mber, 
I don™t remember anymore now.  Uh ... 
when we we nt to -- they took us to Be
rgen-Belsen, in Bergen-Belsen, they gave 
us a new number.  My old concentration 
camp number -- which incidentally I was 

never tattooed, I don™t know why, maybe they
 we ren™t doing it that
 day that I got 
my number or some thing but the old 
number had been 12360 and I was then 
given the number 15713.  Um .. we got a new number, we got put in barracks and 

uh .. we got locked in and that was the e
nd of that.  We  just didn™t hear or see 
from anybody any more .  It was just like 
a .. you were left to your own devices.  
We got some food but we got very little
 water uh .. I reme mbe r  there were these 
pools in the camp which were supposed to be
 water pools that were used .. that 
were supposed to be used if there was 
a fire uh .. they were supposed to pump 
water out of those pools with 
a fire truck and we would 
drink that water.  Later 
on, we found dead bodies in those pool
s -- there was – you know -- it wa s just a 
nightma re and people were sick.  I contra
cted typhus -- I had terrible diarrhea, I 
mean just every day, you would drag yourse
lf outside of the barrack and sit out 

there all day long, leaning 
up against some thing and when it got dark, you drag 
yourself back in. There was no more
 roll call.  You know, during the 
concentration camp -- every morning there wa
s roll call and all that
 kind of stuff.  
People would come  to make sure that 
nobody escaped.  I mean order, total order 
had broken down, it was just a question of
 .. the only question that was in our 
mi nds, ‚How can we survive this?   How can
 we  keep this up?   How can we stay 
well enough until this is over? ﬂ  And 
you know, every day, hundreds of people 
were dying -- dozens of people.  We  would 
try to at least, we
 couldn™t bury them -
- we weren™t strong enough for that -- we 
would drag them towards a place where 
they would all be together.  I mean ther
e was no brutality by guards --  ther e were 
no guards -- there was nobody there.  They 
just put you in a room and locked the 
doors and they would once in a while give 
us some food -- some  watery soup that 
was sort of shoved through the gate a
nd anybody that was strong enough to get to 
the gate could get some  but a lot of peopl
e couldn™t even get up and um .. would 
just die where they lay.  Um – I wa s 
in Bergen-Belsen probably for three 
months.  On the day that I now know wa
s April 15, 1945, we saw tanks with stars 
on them comi ng through the barbed wire a
nd uh .. that was the British army and 
uh .. the German guards were either -- th
e ones that hadn™t me
lted away, I imagine 
a lot of them had run away -- were take
n prisoner and the British came in and I 
guess they were pretty horrified by what th
ey saw because they just couldn™t cope 
with it.  You know, this was an advanc
ing army, they don™t -- how could they 
have me dical facilities for uh .. I believ
e the records indicate that there were 
13,000 unburied dead were found in the camp -- 23,000 unburied dead were 

found in the camp -- 13,000 were to di e fr
om the time that the British took over 
until they we re finally able to br ing sa
nitation and what have you into the camp.  
Uh .. the British couldn™t really do anythi
ng for us for the first couple of weeks -- 
they did bring us food but it was rich food 
that we really couldn™t eat -- but at 
least we got water.  There was no me di
cal attention because how could you have 
enough doctors to take care of all these pe
ople.  And again, it 
was probably fate or 
divine providence that I got be
tter.  And a numb er of us 
got better.  We  were then 
– the British decided to burn .. oh, the Brit
ish used the German guard to bury all 
the unburied dead.  We  s a w that and it was so
rt of satisfaction to us, I guess. Uh .. 
they burned down the camp because they thought that all the barracks had been so 

polluted and so full of excrement and bl
ood and whatever -- there was just no way 
to preserve it and they moved us into a 
nearby um .. what had been  German ar my 
camp, in fac t , when I went back to Be rgen-Belsen -- it is again a  German army 

camp.  You know .. they were two story 
buildings, it was a parade ground and 
typical kind of thing.  And we were in 
there and that™s when I would say -- I 
probably had a recuperation period of three 
to four months -- we got medical care. 
We got adequate – we certainly got f
ood.  We  were treated like human be ings. 
And it™s amazing how fast you snap back a
nd start thinking in terms of e njoying 
your life.  I had mi ssed really all my 
childhood -- really mi ssed all my teenage 
years.  Those were the days when I 
first -- when I all of a sudden became  
interested in girls.  Y
ou know after I got better a
nd I guess the girls became  
interested in boys and we would talk 
and you know .. there would be the norma l 

umm – soc i al – intercourse betwee
n people where you would spend time 

together and enjoy each other™s company.  Uh .. one of the people who worked for 
the British Re d Cross, a lady -- I spoke so
me  Engl ish because  I had take n English 
in school, and probably spoke more than a 
passable English -- not really great but 
more than passable.  She came into the 
barracks one day and said is there anyone 
here who speaks English and I said yeah, 
I speak English.  So she needed, she was 
running a supply uh .. warehouse .. the Brit
ish call it a Supply Dump but it™s 
really not a dump, it™s a warehouse for th
e refugees.  It was organized by the 
British Red Cross and order of St. John a
nd I became  an interpreter for her and 
later became attached to the British army 
as an interpreter and that™s why I am 
wearing the uniform in these pictures. 
 And a mazingly enough, I kept in touch 

with this lady -- Mrs. Payton for all these 
years.  She just passed away probably a 
year ago or two years ago.  We  woul d ex
change Christma s gifts and letters and 
phone calls and she came to visit us once 
and what have you.  And uh .. I worked 
for this British Supply D ump as an 
interpreter and those were wonderful 
days -- it was like .. well 
.. like being let out of 
a cage.  You know, it was 
amazing.  We could get the norma l haircuts
 and we could wear norma l clothes, 
we could talk to other people.  We  fe
lt that we were equa
l to -- well, you know, 
after things like that, you really don™t 
feel that you are equal to anybody and you 
feel always in intimidation of people in 
uniform or the sense of awe of that and 
probably to some  extent, I have never lo
st that  entirely.  Uh
 .. the respect for 
authority if you know what I mean.  
If some body tells you that you are not 
supposed to do it, you just don™t do it or else. 
 

Q: How long did you work with the British? 

 

A: I worked for the British probably until 
late ™42.  Late .. excuse me . I™ve got my 
dates all wrong.  Late ™45, I™m sorry, late ™45, ma ybe early ™46.  Uh .. then, I 

started really thinking seriously about 
what are you going to do with yourself.  
Where do you go from here?   Uh .. most of 
the people that were with me at the 
time, the young people -- almost everybody who survived was young.  There were 

no old people.  I would say everybody was between 15 and 30.  There was 

nobody older that ma de it.  Most of the 
young people wanted to go to Israel which 
was then Palestine.  Uh .. I felt that Is
rael was an agriculture society which was 
what it was and that was not what I wa
nted to do.  Uh .. I wanted to go 
some where else -- I wasn™t sure.  For some  crazy reason, I – my father™s sister 

and her husband had gone to the United Stat
es before the war and for some crazy 
reason I remember their address.  I don™
t know how I ever possibly did that but I 
did do it, O.K.  And I wrote them a letter 
and ma de contact with them.  So, I had 
an opportunity to go to the United States --
 some  other people who did not want to 
go to Israel wanted to go to Australi
a and you know, and we pretty much, except 
for Israel, could decide where we wanted 
to go.  We could stay in Germany, some  
of the people who had been from Ea ster
n Europe had wanted to go back.  Not 
ma ny of them, but some  did.  So – 
 

Q: Did you think of re
turning to Berlin? 
 

A: No.  No.  I wanted to have no part of 
Germany, wanted to have no part of Europe.  
I wanted to go some where else. 
 
Q: Some  woma n: Your 
uncle was in Germany. 
 

A: My uncle wa s in Israel. 

 

Q: woma n:  He  went back to Germany. 

 

A: That was later.  I knew I had an uncle in
 Israel but I just did not want to go – I 
just didn™t wa nt to go to Israel.  I don™
t know why .. yes, I do know why.  I didn™t 
want to work on a farm.  I didn™t want to 
do that.  I wanted to work in some  kind 
of a trade or business enterp
rise or that kind of thi
ng.  Uh – so .. uh, I decided 
that if I wanted to go .. I 
finally decided that I wanted
 to go to America, to the 

United States, and in order to do that, I ha
d to really get into what was then the 

American Zone of occupation.  It wa s very
 difficult to get from the British zone of 
occupation to the United States.  So, this
 Mrs. Payton wrote a recommendation for 
me  to the United Nations Headquarters in 
Munich and also a friend of mi ne who 
was a Canadian captain who I also met 
after the war in Germany did the same  
thing.  And uh .. I had to get permissi
on to take a train -- you know, everything 
was still in disarray.  So I went to 
Munich and started working for the United 
Nations --, the United Nations Legal and 
Rehabilitation Admi nistration doing the 
same  thing again in a warehouse for relief supplies and I applied for going to the 

United States and came here in September 1946.
  I had the relatives -- my  father™s 
sister lived in Springfield, Massachusetts. 
I had some  other relatives who lived in 
Springfield Illinoi s and we were give n, be
fore we left Germany, we were given 
ten dollars as money for -- we came on one 
of the tube ships th
e ﬁS.S. Marlinﬂ -- I 
reme mber that.  I reme mber having our first 
oranges aboard ship and orange juice.  
I never had orange juice before in my 
life and you know, just to see oranges in 
bins -- you know – I hadn™t seen those in te
n years.  I hadn™t seen eggs in ten 
years -- well, not ten years but five 
anyway.  So, you know, this was an amazing 
sight.  It is hard for anyone to imagine 
that kind of stuff.  And uh .. since I had 
seven dollars left out of the ten dollars, when I came  here, and that was not 
enough to go to Springfield, Illinoi s, so I chose to go to Springfield, 

Massachusetts.  Which was that trai
n fare here and that™s basically. 
 

Q: You landed in New York? 

 

A: I came to New York City fi rst.  I di d not like New York City, inside or  outside.  I 
had some  relatives in New York.  I guess 
it was the sister of my grandmother or 
some thing like that and I stayed with her fo
r a couple of weeks.  First of all, it was 
very difficult to find a job in New York
 because that was the time when all the 

GI™s were being demobilized and of cour
se, they had fi rst ri ght -- as well they 
should -- for all the jobs.  And uh .. I went to Springfield and I guess I hung 

around for about two or th
ree weeks doing nothing a
nd just enjoying this 
wonderful country and all the 
opportunities and I decided that I wanted to work in 

either a wholesale or a retail business.  
Springfield had kind of a s mall ma in street 
and I went from one end to the other trying 
to find a job in one of the stores and I 
did not find one.  Later that
 night, some body called my a
unt who I stayed with in 
Springfield and said, ﬁwell, there™s a pers
on who has a store in an outlying section 
of Springfield who is looking for a stoc
k boyﬂ.  I found a job there as a stock boy 
-- then you know, my pr oblem was s c hooling. 
 I never had more than eight years 
of schooling, so uh, what I need to do was first to get my school equivalency 

certificate.  Which, I don™t know if you have
 that here but in Massachusetts, you 
go to the departme nt of education.  They 
devise a plan for you -- evening courses 
that you have to take, correspondence c
ourses that the St ate Department of 
Education gives and I, they devised a pl
an for me whereby I would get the high 
school equivalency certificate which I 
did.  Meanwhile I continued working 
during the day, in that store.  I then ende
d up at Northeastern University at night, 
there was a Springfield division of North
eastern University -- it was a high school 
equivalency certificate and I went to 
Northeastern for six years -- always 
continuing to work at my job -- gradually advancing from stock boy to sales 

person.  Then I started going for my Master
s to American Intern
ational College -- 
another local college in Springfield.  I 
never got my Masters -- I hope to take 

some  courses now and maybe get it.  I 
ultima tely advanced to buyer and then 
general ma nager and then subsequently
 the business was sold to a large 
corporation and I became president then became president for some other 

departme nt stores -- so, I at the height
 of my career, I ran eleven small New 
England Departme nt stores for the Va n 
Heusen shirt corporation and in 1982, I 
had an opportunity to buy the original store 
that I had started wo
rking at as a stock 
boy, which I did and I just sold it in 
March of 1992 and I am retired. That™s 
basically it.  I talked for a 
long time .  If you still have – 
 

Q: Sure -- there™s plenty of tape. 

 

A: Not about Belsen per se.  I had wanted to
 go back to Belsen to see what it was like 
and I was really – I didn™t do it with an 
easy heart.  I wasn™t sure really what I 
would find, but I thought it would be a very lone some  place with ma ybe just a 

few old guys like myself standing there a
nd saying Kaddish -- that™s a Jewi sh 

prayer for the dead.  I do
n™t know if you™re Jewish-- if you know.  So, uh – 
instead we got there on a Sunday morning -- it had been turned into a me morial 

park and I wa s really amazed to s
ee probably two hundred young Germa ns -- 
some  with children going there and just
 looking around.  Visiting this memorial 
park, you have all the mass graves that 
are still there which say ﬁHere lie five 
thousandﬂ, ﬁHere lie five hundredﬂ.  ﬁH
ere lie a thousandﬂ. And so on and so 
forth.  But these people had taken their S
undays to go and look at this and it ma de 
me  feel that was kind of a 
nice thing.  That at least 
these people wanted to know 
about this period of history.
