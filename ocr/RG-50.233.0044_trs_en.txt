Frankfurt.  They were a po or fa mily; they were
 seve n c hildr en a nd my pa

 wa s a bout 50, 60 c h
ildren attending that 
school .
 
 
Wh at was the diff
erence between the public school
?  Wh at did you learn?  
Tell me a little bit about 
what you l ea rned in th
e public  sc hool  and th
en wh at you learned - 
 

 
Public school we l ear ned the la ngua ge, mat he mati c
s and t he re gular  thi ngs  that you lear ned i n t h e  
public sc hool and i n the  Je wish s c

ildren from other t o wns 
like ____ and ____ 
(ph- Counter  #26) a nd it wa s very int eresti n
g for  us t o go to 
t h e Je wi sh sc hool .
 
 
Can you tell me 
a little bit about where yo
u lived in the town?
 
 
Yes.  We li ved - Ul anow is a sma
ll town - but the Jewish
 life was very active.
  The y had a lot of  
Je wish or ga nizati ons like Akibah a n d the other on
e whe r e the  bigger boys  us
e d to go -  Bet a r, a nd  
they had a very large li
brary that Ulanow was pr
oud of i n  all  la ngua ges ,
 Je wish ma inly, He bre w , 
Poli sh and ot her la ngua ge s, a nd ev
er ybody use d to go a nd take thei
r books  a nd re ad. 
 And the  yout h 
of Ulanow  wa s very like - they us
e d  to ma ke dances - it  was a  nice
 quiet life  and I 
t hink ba ck now ,  
I think this will never 
- nobody will ever unders
tand it, how it was - ho
w happy we were with 
al most  nothi ng.  Next  to not
hing, and we  were very happy.
 
 
 
Can you tell me abou
t, can you reme mber
 any instances of anti-sem
itism w hen you were younger?
 
 
Mainl y I remember on Sat urday 
- t hey ha d - public  sc hool s we
re ope n.  We didn't have o u r  
homework and when we needed fro
m the girls to get our homework
, the parents ne
ver permitted it  
and I couldn't understand it, why 
they wouldn't let us 
keep our ho mework 
which was like fo r 
Monday when we go to 
school there.  And anti
-semitin was all over, lik
e when we were going, 
Jewish children, they thro
w st one on us, the Pol is h c hildr en, a nd 
we wer e afr aid.  I al ways  us ed to 
tell the m, "If you do something to 
me, my older brother, he will cat
ch you and he w
ill pay you back 
for me".  And, so, this wa s my
 excuse always.  And he did.  
He  never wa s afraid; he was young, 
strong ma n;  he  was  onl y two ye ars  ol der  fr om me  bu
t  he  was  alw a ys  t her e  for  me.   I  re me mb er  he  
use d to r i de on a bic ycle;  very fe w 
chi ldren had at t hat ti me a bi cycl
e and he taught me
 how to ride a  
bicycle whic h I  was  ver y happy a bout it.
 
 
Do  you reme mb er any other instan
ces -you know you sa
id something about th
rowi ng r ocks - do you 
re me mber a n ythi ng els e a bout people , 
you know, di scri minating agai nst Je ws ?
 
 

The y had le afl ets not  to go t o J e wis h st ores to 
s hop or ther e  wa s a bar b er
, a ver y good ba rber , a 
Je wish one , and t hen t he y
 brought  fr om another  t own another  
barber, but nobody wa
nted to go to 
hi m beca use  he didn't know how to 
cut their hair.  So they all went
 bac k t o the Je wi sh bar ber but  
fr om t he  be ginni ng the y  didn't  want  
to go to the Jewish 
one.  But they fi gure
d now they had a Polish 
barber t he y c an go to hi m.
 
 
Okay - can you tell 
me now a little bit ab
out when the Germans came, wh
en they first got to your 
town, when it was and -
 
 
In 1939 when t he  Ger ma ns  ca me
 in nobody was too much fri
ghte n ed bec a us e some  pe opl e 
reme mb ered the Germans fr om other wars, like pare
nts  a nd gra ndpare nts  and 
nobody wa s s o a frai d  
of the m, but  onc e t hey c a me in an
d t hey start  looking for  Jews an
d c a tchi ng one  or  ca tching a  fe w  
and take  them out of town
 and kill  t h e m and the y  took pe opl e  t o
 other  towns j ust  fo
r work.  So they 
took t hem and t hey mistr e ated th
em, beat them, so late
r we  s a w that t ho se  ar e n ot t he  Ger ma ns  what  
we  he ard a b out  from our  gra ndpare nt s, or eve n pa rents .
 
 
Do you re me mber  -  I  know t hat  th
ey invaded in September of l93
9.  Do you reme mb
er about what  
ti me  t hey got  to your  town?  
 Wa s it  lat e in Sept e mber or  i n t he mi ddle  of Se pte mber?
 
 
It was the like the end 
of September I wo uld say.
 
 
When they came into your town 
did they arrive all  at once - 
di d the ar my c o me  all  at  onc e ?
 
 
No, no.  Th ey first came 
few and then later.  Ri
ght  after a week or  so 
t hey bur ne d our  wonder ful  
synagogue which ever
ybody was  pr oud of.  It  was a bea uti fu
l s yna gogue - paint ed, t h e c eiling wa s 
painted with all ten comm
andments and all the paintings, and 
angels.  It was just a be autiful  
synagogue; so this is 
what t he y did.  First  they bur ned a n
d they went around asking people who 
bur ned t he  s yna gogue?   So of co
urs e nobody sa id anyt
hi ng;  they didn't  ans w
er anything.  The y  
droppe d i n j ust t o see  how pe opl e li ved an
d e ver ybody was  alr ead
y very fri ghte ne d.
 
 
Uh m- hmn.  Did they - when they 
fi rst ca me, did they introduce an
y laws, you know, like Jews  had 
to be off the  street  or  anyt hing li ke that ?
 
 
Thi s wa s li ke gr aduall y. 
 Until su mmer, like it was 
si x o'cloc k, I t hink six o'
clock the Jews  were not 
allowed to be in 
the streets anymore.
 

 
But  t hat didn't happe n i m me diate l y?
 
 
No, not  i mmediatel y. Righ
t  - a fe w mont hs.  And we us ed t o 
gather , t he J e wis h c hildre n a nd young 
people, like the age differe
nce was very little.  We  used to gath
er in backyards 
from other people 
and when the snow fell do
wn the y a ske d all t he Je ws, the boys, 
girl s, e ve r ybody, fa
thers, mothers ,  
old, young to go to
 shovel the snows from th
e road and they be at th
em too while they were  
shoveling the snow.  And then they took them to 
wo rk  wher e the  ar my  wa s 
st anding t h ere -l ike t h e 
ar my st anding there.  So t hey t o
ok t o c hop wood a n d do all t he hou
se work whate ver t he  girls ha d to  
wa sh the  di s hes  so I  us ed to go t here  t oo.
 
 
Now, we 've  bee n tal king generall y 
about t he Ger mans.  Wer e  they a
ll, the people who - the soldiers  
that were in your t o wn, we
r e t hey ar my s oldiers  or
 were they SS soldiers?
 
 
SS just dropped in and ca
ught a  fe w, took out  and 
kil led.  The ones who we
re standing there, the 
army, they were regu
lars - regular army.
 
 
Was t her e any di fference bet ween 
the wa y the regular ar my trea te
d pe ople  a nd the  wa y t he SS did?
 
 
Yes, ther e was a di fference. The r e
gular ar my didn't  go i n t he street
s and beat people
.  Whe n t hey 
nee d some body for  wor k 
the y  as ke d-  the y  went 
to the ___(Counter# 100)  to the town and they 
asked "I need ten Jews, twenty Jews
 for work", so they ga
ve them .  They calle
d up people and they 
gave t he m a nd the y wor ked th
ere and t hey di dn't beat  them
 or anything else like that.
 
 
Can you tell me about
 a little what happened in 
the town after the 
Germans come in, 
were there lots 
of shortages of 
food, you know, t hat  ki nd of thi ng?
 
 
I di dn't  tell  you about  t he  ni ght s -  you know the 
ni ghts  -  there  wer e shorta
ges - nobody - fo od.  We  
didn't  ha ve  what t o we ar , beca use  
you c oul dn't buy a nyt hing, whate ver
 you had. So  my mo ther gave 
us all her dresses, and there came
 a dr essmaker which wa
s  fr om a not her  t o wn 
and she  ha d no me ans  
of earning anything so 
t he old dresses she  was se wing for us
 and make them 
smal l or narrow, 
wh atever, and shoes, we  didn't have 
a ny.  The feet  were  growi ng, but
 we  didn't ha ve  a n y shoes ,  but 
wit h whatever we had we manage
d a nd t he n s o me ot her pe ople ca
me  fr om other t o wns t hat ha d a  
shoe stor e so i f  the y  ha ve  a fe w pa
irs of shoe s so t h ey al
wa ys accused me  that I 
was lucky.  I  needed 
a pair of shoes somebody would just
 come in that day an
d they woul d sa y t hey 
ha d my size, so t he y  

all say maybe it was l u ck because 
you se e I was the onl y one  who 
s ur vive d.  And nobody els e. 
The y al ways  calle d me  t h e lucky one .
 
 
You sai d s o met hing about s cre
a ms  i n  the  ni ght . Can you -
 
 
Yes.  This was before the Germans came in and wh
en t he Pol i sh ar my left
 a l ready. Ever y ni ght for  
wee ks  -  it t o ok from t he begi nni ng 
of Septe mber  t o t he  end of Septe m
ber, let's say - the Poles were 
ever y night goi ng to another house ,
 a  Je wis h hous e, a nd r obbi ng wh
atever  the people
 had s o e ve n  
they had this little so it was even
 less and the people sc
reamed.  So th
en was going 
around a joke  
beca use  s o me chi l dre n of one fa
mi ly t hey heard some
body was  walki ng by 
and they say "Mommy , 
should we  st art screa mi n g al
r eady? ", beca use  they kne w 
all we  could do is scream.
 
 
Now this is be fore the war, right?
 
 
No, t his  is  ri ght  whe n t he  war starte d, 
right  the beginni ng a fter  t he wa r st arte d.
 
 
We re t he se groups of Pol es or j ust  -
 
 
Gr oups, they were  gr oups .
 
 
Okay, we talked about most of
 l939. Ca n you te ll me , was t her
e a ghetto set up in Ulanow?
 
 
No, no, t her e  was  no ghet to; it  was  too s mal
l  a  town.  The y coul dn
't divi de the town.
 
 
About  how ma ny people  were  in
 the town, do you reme mb er?
 
 
In t he whol e town?  They say about  6,
000 but some people
 say eve n le ss.
 
 
Do you re me mber how many Je ws 
were in the town?  Generally?
 
 
Ge nerall y?   Maybe hal f  t he t o wn wer e Je ws.
 

 
So you s aid t here was no ghett o.  
You talked about 
the Ger mans taki ng pe ople out for work detai l s.  
Do  you know mu ch 
about what happened t o t hes
e  wor k detail s  or  anythi ng?
 
 
Some came back - some came back, and some they 
took fr om there to conc
entrati on camps already.  
They ne ver came back.
 
 
Did you know some  of the peop
le who we nt on work det ails?
 
 
Ye s.
 
 
Did t hey tell  you a nyt hi
ng about wh at happened?
 
 
Ye s. Th ose wh o c a me 
back, those few, they ha d 
to bring t he m on wa gons
.  The y coul dn't wal k  
anymore.  They didn't fe ed 
the m, t he y di dn't have  shelt ers whe r e 
to sleep.  They looked awful.  This  
is the first time when we
 sa w a pers on c o ming ba
ck fr om like a ghetto.  
 
How were  these pe ople  c hos en
 to go t o work ca mp s?  
 
 
The y j ust ga ve to the  Judenrat l et 's sa y we need 50
 peopl e, so they came at  
night a nd t h ey took the m  
beca use  nobody would go volunte er.
  So t hey came at  
ni ght  wit h t he Je wis h poli ce beca use  they  
already ha d J ewi sh police  th
ere and they took them and they se nt  them away.
 
 
Did t hey des cribe  what  t h ey did?
 
 
The  people?  The y dig di tches ,  the y dig ditc hes  a n
d mostl y somet hing be c aus
e t hey li ke pr epared 
themselves probably for t he war wit h Russia.
 
 
Now I know that when the Germans came in in
 '39 they split Poland
 with the Soviets -
 
 
Ye s,  we wer e  ju st on  -  a b
out  on the border there.  Because the 
Russians came in to us and they were 
about for two weeks and then after they 
move d bac k, the n t h
e Germans came  in. 
 
 

So the Ger mans came fir s tand t hen t h e Russians came?
 
 
No , the Russians came  first.  Let 
me think.  The Russians ca me first, yes, and then they moved out 
and t he n  - t he River Sane m was li ke
 at that ti me t hat you coul dn't 
cr oss it .  A J e w c oul dn't cr oss t o  
the other side of the Sa
ne m.  Never a g ain.  
 
 
Wa s t here  - let me as k you -  I 've  ha d other i nter v
i ews where peopl e have sa
id t hat you know right  
wh en they fi rst came  in and then the Ru ssians pul
led back ther e was a choi
ce of whet he r you woul d 
wa nt t o go to the  Russi
a n side  or  sta y on the  Ger m an side . 
Di d people  run t o  the  Russia n side?
 
 
A lot of people run with 
them.  My father didn't wa
nt to go.  M y ol der brot
her Hi rsc hel, he went. He  
did, but he came back.  
After a fe w months being on the Russia
n side the border wa
s still  not like a 
border.  You could go this
 way or that way.  He di
dn't go.  Until today I me
an I think if we would 
onl y have went ma ybe i n  Rus sia ma ybe we  would sur vive.
 
 
Did your fa t her ha ve a r e ason for not  goi ng?   
 
 
He  j ust  didn't  wa nt  to go. Just
 a  fear  of "I 'm goi ng t o  lea v
e my home and ev
erything and go 
someplace? Where ar
e we  going to stay, wh er
e are we  going to live?"
  Nobody t hought t ha t  
something terrible like this
 wo uld happen - nobody.
 
 
Did most pe ople , especia lly t he Je ws , wer e t hey
 more fearful of the Ru
ssians than the Germans?
 
 
No.  They weren't fearful of the Ru
ssians.  No, not at all.  Not  at 
all, at this poi nt they we ren't 
fe ar ful .   
 
 
Why don't you go on 
and tell me about li
ke from '40 on, what happe ne d
 in the town and what you  
reme mb er about  when the Germans were there?
 
 
In '41, i n the  be ginning 
I think of '41, they came
 at night and they took 
my older  br other  away for  
work in a work camp.  
This wa s not a regular -- there wa
s already SSpeopl e t her e and he was 
worki ng like work i n a wo
rk camp.  This was in 
______(Counter# 182) and 
I  went  ther e be ca use  in 
the camp they didn't
 give them food, ve
ry little, and they couldn't survive 
on that food. 
 And I stayed 
wit h a famil y and ever y day I  took
 food a nd br ead a nd all  di ffe rent  
things.  And I br
ought for all the 

Ulanow boys, fo r my  brothe
r  and all  for  the  ot he r boys.  Onc e t h
ey caught us.  I 
was with another 
girl a nd the  other  girl  was ol der  tha n I but  wh
en she saw t h e Ger mans goi
ng -  the SS - she  sta r t  
running.  I hold her be the ha nd, s h
e s houldn't run, but  she r un anywa y
.  So I ha d to run aft er her a nd  
then t hey caught us 
and they brought us in th
at  ca mp.  And my brot her  
wa s st anding I  sa w he  was  
wal king fort h and bac k a nd he s aid 
" Don't be  a fra id, don't be a fra id. 
 You'r e ver y l ucky."  Agai n I ' m 
lucky."    The good guar d is t oda
y."  Because t h ere were
 ma ybe t en guar ds.  "This one", he sai d 
"woul dn't ha r m you. Don't be a fr a
id, don't ."  And one  of the  othe
r s c a me over  and wa nted to kic k 
me  a nd he  hold hi m ba c k.  He  di
dn't  let hi m kic k  me.  And they 
hol d us f or a  whil e maybe for a n 
hour, tal ked, spoke, and th
ey let us go.  So  we  we
re r eally at  that t i me ve
r y -  be cause  they c oul d 
have left  us in that wo
rk camp.  Then I saw that
 there is going to be 
no other way but it still was 
l941, so it still wasn't  as 
strict as later and somebod
y told me that he can gi
ve me some papers that  
my br othe r  works  for  hi m a nd I  can
 go and give a Po lish guy who wo
rked for the Germans to gi ve 
him money a
nd he will let my
 brother go.  
 
 
Ca n you te ll me , did you t ell 
me  this was in Ulanow?
 
 
Ula now, _____( Coun
ter# 204) , yes . 
 
 
Ho w far fr om Ulanow is that?
 
 
We ll, this is about 3 mi
les - well, about ten, 15
 at l east kil o met ers.
 
 
So that 's  ma ybe  10 mil es  or  so?
 
 
No. Oh, ma ybe.  15 
kil o meters at l east .
 
 
So  you went there 
with your friend?
 
 
She  wa s t he bride  of one  of t he boys  
wh o was the r e.  He  was  i n t he ca mp .
 
 
So  you all walked 
fr oml your home  - ?
 
 

We  walked from - our home - we st
ayed in Ulanow.  I stayed with 
a fa mily in Ulanow (Counter# 
208) a nd eve r y day I wa s just goi ng
 over a nd just  br ingi ng the m fo
od.  An d every time  some how it - 
we  knew at the time  - we  checked whether the guards
 were  goi ng thi s way, th
at way - we just had a 
second to gi ve t he m food.
 
 
So di d you j ust pas s t his  food t hrough the  gate?
 
 
Thr ough the  bar bed wire s, yes , th
rough t he fenc e  - for the  all  boys
 fr om Ulanow wh
o we re there, 
not  jus t  for my brot her .
 
 
So can you tell me a 
little about, you said that you
 were able to bribe the of
ficials? tell
 me a little 
about -
 
 
Ye s, so I  went t o that J ude nrat i n Ula now and 
I asked them they should
 give the official the 
envelope with the money with the 
na me from my brothe r an
d fr om the pe opl e.  Thi s was like Poli s h  
who could employ Jews .  
And they said "No,
 today is  We dne sda y and we  were  al rea d y t oday, t his 
morning.  It will take 
another week that we can 
go."  I said "No, I am
 no way waiting for another 
wee k.  I a m goi ng by my sel f."   And he s aid " Y ou ca
n't go up there."  I said
 "It doesn't matter; I'll 
ma na ge."   And I  took my 
ar mband and I  tur ned i t ar ound.  I  fi
gure d  in c as e I  d
on't know, but they 
shouldn't see it.  And I ran into 
that building.  Of course I ran 
-and the n I s aw some body want s t o  
ope n t h door .  I  just took his  ha
nd a w ay a nd I j ust  go and I  as ke
d wher e a nd i n whic h room is Mr.  
___(Counter 229) I s
till remember today his name. 
 And i walked in 
and I said "Mr. At
aisky, here is 
the envelope and her e is 
the name.  And he knew 
about it because t he ot her 
people t old hi m, and I 
ran out .  And the  next  da y the y l et hi m go.
 
 
The y l et hi m go?
 
 
Ye s.  Hi m a nd a not her f e w from our
 town. And this was 
Friday afternoon and 
I  remember " H ow ar e 
we going to get home?"  
Because it was pretty far; we wo uld ha
ve t o wal k for hours I thi nk.It was -
so I went in the market and I saw 
a peasant that I knew, and I walked 
over to him and 
I said "Listen, 
my  parents will pay you mo ney; I 
don't have with me  any 
mo re, and take 
us home ."  He
 said "Okay, 
fi ne."  With a fe w pe opl e 
that they let go and my
 brot her and mysel f.  So
 we were already about  
four boys and I and the peasant, he took us home .  An d I re me
mber  be fore  we  ca me  int o our  t own 
this picture I'll never forget, my 
uncle, who was later k
illed, he was standing in 
the door, and he saw 
us coming - .  
And myuncle, my mo
ther's brother, who was later k
illed, while we 
were still home , 
he wa s be ndi ng over l ike , over, li ke he  was  so happy
 t o s e e  us  th at we  were
 c o min g ho me  an d t hat  I  
was able to get out my br
othe r and t h e other boys, and my pare nt
s were so happy. 
 This was like the 

first time that they were
 ha ppy for  a nyt hing duri ng that  war  an
d the bad time s.  
So we were  still 
home .  This wa s '41.  An
d then t he  Russia n- Ger man war  br oke  out . 
 This was a few days just befor e  
they got out, that I got out
 my br ot her.  So tha t  da y, whe n t h
e war br oke  out they 
bea t everybody i n  
the camp, all  the Jews, they
 be at them because they 
were so angry that  the wa
r broke out.  An d the y  
didn't know how they 
we re, I don't know - 
 
 
Now this was the camp that
 your br ot her was i n?   
 
 
Ye s, yes, in Ulanow Belsen. 
 
 
So  you got him ou
t just  in time?
 
 
Just  in time , like a da y or  two later after that  they
 got  hi m out .  Ma ybe it  
was already i n  the process 
and we were abl e 
to come home.   
 
Ok ay .   Be fo re we  talk  a bou t  whe n  t he  war  wit h  th

something about turni

 this place.  Wh
en di d t hey put - when did the y  
ma ke  Je ws  s t art wea r ing ar mba nds?  
 Wa s it right  after they came in?
 
 
No. Not right.  About  the  begi nni ng of '41.
 
 
Wa s that for you - I know 
in s o me  other cas es  it wa s ve ry da
ngerous to do th
at - was it very 
danger ous  for you?
 
 
Of course. And I wa sn't  allowed to
 go into that building
.  This wa s like the Ge
stapo building.  Only 
Pol e wor ked ther e.  But  I  figured 
" No, I ' m not goi ng t o l e t a not her we ek
 go by. I f I just had one , j ust  
a little ___(Count
er# 266) I will succeed. 
 I let that othere girl
 I told you I 
walked before 
it, I left  her 
outsi de  waiti ng for  me  and I  sai d 
if I don't come  out, she should kn
ow where I a m.  
That she  should  
know t hat  I  didn't  c o me  out , that  t he y calle d me  or  
what ever  there, but  I  succe
eded and this time he 
came home  and we were 
home already until '42.
 
 
Ok ay, why don't you tell 
me  about  t he  when t he  Ge
r mans inva ded t he  Sovi et Union?   This  would be  
June of '4 1.
 
 

'41, yes.  It  wa s a ver y  bad ti
me .  They came into town  and they
 took our neighbor
.  He  had two 
small children.
 
 
Now this is the SS who came into town?
 
 
Who knows?  Wh atever -t
hey came in, they took pe
ople, took them 
out of the town 
and they killed 
them.  One jumped
 in the river, they killed 
him in the river like they sh
oot after him.  He jumpe d  
fr om t he  bri d ge.  Ye s.
 
 
(A man's voi ce enter s at  t his t i me.)
 
 
I was this time - I never 
went out, never - 'til the en
d of the war - this guy wh
at came, he was an S S  
man, he was a killer.  Th
is was - he killed for fu n 
- he came fr om Ulanow 
with a motorbike.  He 
stoppe d t he  motor bike a nd took out  
whatever  he caught .  He
 t ook t he m outside  to
 the other side of 
the river.  I went over 
there with him and I saw th
e grave.  They killed him 
over there and he left.  
 
 
You see, we still didn't know they 
took them, but we di
dn't know fo r 100% wh
at they did with  
the m.  I f  t he y c o me  ba ck, i f  the y - 
 
so he , he wa s al wa ys  ve r y brave s o he went 
t here to see what  happened t o t he other Pol e s.
 
 
It was  ve ry e asy to di
g a  hole  to c ove r  this .
 
 
So thi s wa s j ust one ma n - ?
 
 
This was just  one time this happened.  Later we 
did't follow anymore; we 
knew.  The y t o ok a fe w -  
 
 
One boy, he was a dentis
t and it was a little boat, 
and he jumped in the ri
ver, the San, and he was  
swimming, but he killed it
 
He  s hot  hi m fr om t he  boa t .
 
 
We re t he se peopl e c hosen, t he pe ople  t hat t he y c a m e a nd got?
 
The y j ust  sa w t he m in the str eet?
 

 
Whoever wa s outside. Wh
en  we sa w Ger ma ns , I 
says "Come everybody, 
 
run i n t he house , cl ose  the door ." And that  was i t
. Oh , on e ti me  I re me mber  one  ti me t he y ca me  a n d  
they were going down
 the street and they were
 just beating peop
le, just beating, not killing, just 
beati ng.  And t hey came
 int o our  house  and whe n we  he ard t h
ey're  comi ng, 
so first  we sa ve d t he 
men.  So my father run 
acros s t he  st reet, my br other run a w a y 
t he other s i de t o a nei g hbor 's ,  to a 
Pole's  yard, just -. And we rema in
 i n t he hous e.  They 
came and they hit us wi
th a rubber
, you know, 
a tr unche on, but  I  r e me mbere d  tha t  my br othe r  is  r unn
ing away this wa y, so I ra n a circle with them 
in the yard t hat he shoul
dn't r un i n t h is way whe r e my br othe r  
ran a wa y, he shoul dn
't fi nd hi m.  So 
there were later the gi rls laughing for me; they said
 I played Hi de and Seek 
with them because I was 
running in circles that he 
should not  go in t he  ot he r si de .  Me  he
 hit  -  it  heal ed, bec aus e  when you'r e 
young i t  hea l s.  But  my 
mo ther, you know that scar 
on t he  ba ck what  he  ga
ve her - as 
long as we  
were still home, for a year
, it still was on 
there, the scar 
was still there.
 
 
Ok ay.  Can you just go on from th
ere?  What  happened aft er  t he Ge
r ma ns  go, whe n  the  war  wit h  the  
Soviet  Uni o n st arts?
 
 
Yes.  This st arted in '41. So th
is was already - aft er '4 1 t his was 
about  the sa me.  Peopl e ca me fr om 
other  towns .   The y didn't  ha ve what
 t o ea t, but we  ha d some  fi elds
 wher e we  pla nte
d potatoes.  So 
we  had enough potatoes fo
r us  and even for  ot her  pe
ople.  In our own field 
we  c oul dn't go like  a ny  
ti me  to pic k beca use  we wer e a fra
id of the Poles again.  
So we went eve ni ngs or ver y early i n t he 
morni ng and the chil dre n onl y we nt.  My pare nts  didn'
t go just we - 
I with my  younge
r sister mainl y 
because the boys were still older; we
 were afraid.  Just for the girl
s maybe.  So we
 went with our 
hand, we j us t  took out  whate ver we  c oul d a nd br
ought back home.  So we
 had enough;  we were n't  
hun gr y.   As  lon g as  we  wer e  ho me  we  wer e n 't h
ungry.  And we  sti ll coul d 
hel p wit h  potat oes  some  
other  pe opl e.  And bre a d wa s ve ry 
lit t l e, but some how for s o me thi ngs
 we use d to  se
ll.  No matter 
how little things you 
had, you still had some
thing to sell - for fl our and fo
r other things.  So as lon g  
as we were home we weren't real
l y hungry.  We -  ther
e we re other people wh
o wer e worse off tha n  
we  wer e .   S o me  pe asa n t s  o wed  
us  s o me  thi ngs, mone y, s o  t hey
 brought sometime
s something, so 
we could survive.  If th
ey would only let us stay
 home, even 
not give us 
anything we still would 
survi ve .
 
 
You said something about other people coming into the town -
 
 
From ot her  t owns .
 
 
From nearsby?
 

 
From near by.  They chas
ed out all  the Jews from t he ot her  
towns.  From _____________(Counter # 
350).  So they all came to our 
town and eve r ybody found r el ative ,
 ac quai ntance, whoever , a nd we  
all put them up.  Everybody was 
living somewhere.  Br
ead was very little; we 
didn't have enough 
brea d, but there wer e wer e ot her t hi ngs - mil k, or  
s o me other t h ings , we  c ould ma na ge.  Ye s, we had  
a cow and we had a very big, large 
cow, so  my  father ga
ve it  to a peasant  a
nd he said, "And you'll 
give me your small one"
, because he hoped that 
the smaller one 
who just has a 
little milk they 
would let us  kee p.  So for a while
 they let us keep th
e  s mall one , but s o me Po
le squealed that we 
have a  c o w and for  all  the  neighbors, all  the 
childr en, whatever  we 
had clos e by, rel atives,  
neighbors , s o we ha d mi lk for t he m.  We al mos t  di
dn't drink any, ju
st for them, but 
then they ca me 
one da y a nd they took t h e cow a w ay.  And t he n a gain,
 they sent me to that
 Ger ma n t o ask hi m he 
should gi ve us t he c o w back.  So 
my mother tried 
to dr ess me I  shoul d look 
like an old l ady.  I was  
19 years  old, s he  wa nte d  to dre ss  
me  - or  18 -  I  s hould l ook li ke  -  
so she put me  on
e kerchief, the 
other  ker chi ef.  The  one  thing that
 I wasn't afraid too much to go
 because this SS
 ma n lived in a 
Polish fa mily's  house and I knew them.  Their gi rl
 we nt wit h  me  to sc hool
 and I knew they were 
dece nt peopl e.  So I we nt in t h
ere and the woma n from 
the house told me ri
ght away "Don't be 
afraid.  He 's  not going to harm 
you."  So I  went  i n 
and I spoke German to 
hi m, because when t h e 
war broke out my father to
ok a German tutor and he
 figured we don'
t know what's  go
ing t o be  an d 
we  didn't go to school.  After when
 t he  war  br oke out  nobody we nt  
e ver  to school , s o  we  lear ne d 
Ger ma n .  And I  some how pic ke d up ea sy l anguag
es so I spoke pretty 
good t hat he  underst ood 
everything.  Besides 
it's  a little similar to
 Yiddish but I spoke
 German and I told
 him that so many 
children depend on that one cow,  
and it 's onl y s t anding 
in the st reet for t hree  da ys a nd nobody t ake s  
it anypl ace .  And couldn't  you give  us 
bac k, plea se .  He didn'
t do harm to 
me but he said no, and this  
was t he end of t he mi lk.
 
 
Was this epi sode wher e t he 
Pole yelled or told the 
Ger ma ns  tha t  you all had a cow, di d t hat happen  
frequently?  Did they do 
t hat t o other people  too?
 
 
Oh, ye a. All  over ,  i f  the y  kne w t h

"Everyone in the house is

I was embarrassed fo r th

the mse lve s, they didn't  e ven c has e us  or  -  e ver ybody
 has to leave the town an
d go t o  Saklikov.  It  
wa s like  Yom Ki ppur, t h at da y, e ver y
body not knowi ng what t o do and 
where to go.  My father st art  
already about a mont h be fore
 that about to start to preparing Ar
yan paper s for us chil dre n.  He  kne w 
somebody in a village
 who was the head of the v
illage and he had al
l these papers th
at he could do 
that.  So he got  - li ke a wee k 
l ater  the ma n c a me - he  br ought  over  
the papers for my ol der brot her ,  
Hirschel, for mysel f, and for my yo
unger  sist er Ula .  And fa te want
ed t h at my pa per s were good. 
The t wo, he made a mi st ake; he 
put t he pict ures  from my brot her on
 my  si ster 's c a rd  a nd fro m my  
sister 's  on my brot her 's.  And he  was  ne
ver was able to brin
g it  bac k.  (Side B)
 
 
Ok ay .
 
 
So we  couldn't move  around anym
or e so fr eel y i n the to
wn but they somehow 
lat er, what I found  
out that they still
 were able to get the papers
, but they weren't able to go
 away anyplace.
  They were 
just in the neighborho
od, the villa
ge or so.
 
 

So  your papers were good.
 
 
My pape rs wer e good.  It wa s just
 a paper with a pictur e that t his--a
 false  paper of c our s e.  And t hat  
day, so ever ybody had t o le ave  
town.  So I  kne w  I had alr eady 
t he pa per  and my 
husband now, he 
had hi s pape rs too, beca use he pre pare d fr om 
us , s o  we we nt a w ay t ogethe r . But  he we nt - 
 
 
Oh , I'm sorry.  Did you get married?
 
 
No, we got  mar ried in 1946.
 
 
So later .  But  you were  wi th your hus band
 at  thi s ti me .  Be fore you got  marr ied?
 
 
Yes.  At this ti
me.  At this day.  But we 
still couldn't leave the town to
gether so he left  and later 
there was no bridge ove r the River 
San, so t here was like a ferr y.  I  ca
me on the ferry an
d this guy, a 
lot of Poles, he said " W
here are  you goi ng?   You're not all owed 
to go on t he ferr y; get  out!"   So I  
we nt  out, r u n bac k  to t o wn, di dn
't  go home  anymore, because ther
e wasn't  ti me  
So I fi gure d  I 'm 
goi ng to go t o some
body who I kne w, that he  kn
ew that guy.  And so the 
Jewi sh guy went with me  
and we paid hi m whate v er a mount
 a nd he j ust t ook me ove r the 
ri ver  by mysel f .  Now, he wa s  
already gone, my husband,
 so Bernard, he was al
ready gone, and I figured 
I hope I still can catc h 
hi m be fore  I ' ll go to t he  next  town w
ith the train.  In our  town there wa
s no train.  And 
I ran so fast , I 
ran and fi nal ly from far, far, I see 
some body i s wal king. 
 I  figure d  it  must be
 him.  So anyway I 
wal ked as fast as I could and I 
caught up, and I s ee  hi m 
looki ng bac k i f I 'm c o
ming.  Whe n we went 
there, the train was going la
te  at ni ght  a nd we  di dn't ha ve  whe r e 
t o hi de  for  that  ti me  s o  we  wal ke d 
around jus t i n the town. I  kne w I kne w a  nei ghbor of
 our s moved to that town.  I walked into them 
and they told me, "You kn
ow what, it wo uld be better
 i f you go like near by 
a  woods, wal k ar ound i n  
the woods.  Don't wait by us." 
 So I kne w; so we  wal ke d a round [Mal e voi ce," Pol ish pe ople" ] yea h, 
we walked around there until it wa
s Sunday--it was Frid
ay--no, it couldn't be 
Sunday--okay, so we  
walked around until the trai
n was supposed to
 arrive and we went
 on the train.  In the train ride--
Ber nar d kne w s o me pe ople who we nt be fore  us  to
 Stree (Ph# 29,si de B) so
 we took the train to 
Stree.  I remember when 
we arrived there, no, when
 I was sitting in the trai
n, he was sitting.  We  
didn't sit t ogether , because one Jew 
doesn't stick out so much, two--, 
this  what wa s t he phil osophy.  
So I was sitting by myself
 and here was a young man 
sitting near me.  Finally 
it was night, he falls 
asleep and he put his head on my
 shoulder accidentall
y.  And I was sitting qui
et; I was very happy 
that it should look like 
I'm travelling with him.  
And then he  woke  up;  he  s aid, he  a pol ogize d,  "I 'm 
so sor ry, now you put your hea d on
 my s houl der."  I sai d " G ood."   
So I  put  my hea d on his  shoul der ,  
I didn't sleep.  It
 was even uncomfortab
le, but I was sitting lik
e this until a fe w ho
urs, until we came 
closer t o Str ee, which was alread
y morni ng.  The n I  fi gure d  I 'd better  r un out  first  be fore  Bernard  
beca use i n c ase they c atc h me here, s o he shoul
d see that they 
caught me .  Anywa y, I r un out a nd  

we went to those people that he
 knew.  We  stayed th
ere for a few weeks until 
Bernard was able t o  
fi nd work alr eady as a Pole.  They 
would give  us  a n apart me nt aft er 
Jews, t hat they t ook the Jews t o  
the ghetto, because St ree was alread
y a ghett o.  They gave
 us a one-r oo m apart ment  and we li ved i n  
that roo m.
 
 
Let me backtrack just a little bit?
 
 
Yeah, wh at happened to my  mo th
er, I think you 
want t o know.
 
 
Yeah, first let me as
k you, just to put on
 the tape; the na me  
that you used on y
our  fal s e pape rs  and 
also, t hese were Ger man papers that
 wer e is sued, right?   They wer e--?
 
 
The  lat er one  was  Ger ma n, ke nn car ds.
 
 
These were the false pape rs that 
you c alled the m Aryan paper s, right?
 
 
Ye s.   
 
 
Did t hey have a  Ger ma n s ta mp on the m?
 
 
Ye s.
 
 
Ok ay .
 
 
First , I  had j ust li ke  a pa ssport.  
Like  a Pol i sh tha t  the y ga ve be fo

home , I stil l had.  The n when yo
u ha d this , what we 're goi ng t o ha ve
 t o ba cktrac k la
ter to how I got 
this German papers.  
I didn't have a birth certificat
e.  Later, this is a whol
e different st
ory until I ha d 
to get my birth cert i ficate.  Ber nar d went back 
in 1943, he  we nt back 
through all t his, on the  
Ger ma n side , to get my birth cer ti
ficat e from a pri e st who 
some body kne w.  The  pr
iest knew that he 
is giving those papers for a Jewish
 girl with no payment.  He  ma
de  the  bi rth ce rti ficat e, it shoul d 
coordinate with my  paper what 
I  ha d wit h  the phot o from P olish.  
Whe n I  ha d t his  two pa pers , I 
coul d get a Ger ma n ke nn car d.  
Wh at they called, with the German

didn't  wor k because they could find

After the wa r, I found out

wea r ing my brot her 's pants.  I r
ecogni zed.  I wal ked over, he said 
I bought  it  fr om s o me body, which  
is possible too.  
Not--possible that this
 guy killed him, 
but that he bought it. 
 Then my mother, my  
mother tried to get to S______(c.
87).  This was a town 
where Jews were still. 
 They were not yet 
chased out.  She tried t o 
get t here , t o S______.  
On the wa y, they hire d a

 Udel and Monya k and

They were buried in a

Wa s it a conscious decision on your fa
mily's part to split up and go di
fferent--?  It would be safer 
that way, that some body
 ma ybe woul d get a way?
 
 
Ye s.  My fat her was a ve ry wise 
ma n.  He  already thought of things 
li ke be fore, that 
this wo uld be a 
very good thing.  But he
 didn't plan anyt hing for  hi ms el f or fo
r my  mo th er b eca us
e they felt that 
they have no chance.  Bu
t my  mo th er  wo uld  hav e  
had a  c hanc e t oo beca us e s he  di dn't  l ook li ke  a  
typic al  Je wis h woma n.  But he  didn't  
think in that  terms, just  of us.  This wa s the best  thing that  he  
coul d of-- , i f  not, no 
one wo uld have survived.
 
 
How ol d wer e your  parent s at  thi s poi nt?
 
 
My mother wa s 46 a nd my fat her
 was 52.  Wh atever money my  fa
t her ha d, he divi de d a mong us  
that day when we  suppos
ed to leave.  One man walked over 
t o  hi m a nd he  kne w
 that I'm going 
awa y on t he Ar yan si de.  He
 sai d, gi ve  her  the most .  
 
 
Yo u?
 
 

Me.  Because he knew that
 t hey have a sl i mmer  chan
ce of surviving.
  Lat e r I  figure d that one  out . 
The  mone y t hat he  gave  me  was  i n dollars , ver y few 
zl otys, we di dn't  ha ve  an
y zlot ys .  Later  when I  
was in Stree, Bern
ard went to the gh
etto, to the Jewish ghetto.  It 
was still open, it wa
sn't closed, to 
cha nge  t he  mone y.  We  s hould ha
ve from the beginning, we  should
 have to add for  s o methi ng t o  
buy, or what ever we nee ded, s o met h

r e me mbe r  he ca me  over, he  ga ve  
me another hundred do
llars.  He said be
cause that man to

 you mo re. 
 It's little 
things li ke t hat--- .  I  re me mber  another t hing what 
my father said when he gave me that money. 
Re me mber  by Je ws , t he y  gi ve  a  __
______( 124), when a  gi rl
 gets  marri ed.  So he
 said this is your 
_______.  Bernar d found work by 
t he Ger mans because t his was t he 
best  pl ace for hi m t o wor k.  He  
kne w how t o--.  The main t hing 
be fore I  tell you-- ..  The mai n
 t hing how t o s urvive on Ar ya n 
papers, t his wa s your be havi or 
and your  speec h.  He
 ke pt  corr ecting me  all  the- -every day.
 
 
Practi cing?
 
 
He still corrects 
me now when I say something.
  I say the war is
 over.  Always do
n't use that word,  
don't  use ________(c .134), don't this
.  He  was  ri ght  about e v erythi ng
 what he said to me, he was 
right .  Then I shoul d ne ve
r go t o a  bea uty parl or bec aus e he  
felt, which was righ
t too, that they 
worke d too close  to pe ople.  The y
 know people , they ca n fe el pe opl
e.  I  braid my hai r  and I wor e 
braids.  All  t he  war  I  wor e brai ds . 
 T h en  it  was  '4 2 , the  wi nter  we nt
 by.  Ne ighbors  start  a ski ng me  
why I don't  go t o c hur ch?   Oh
, you asked me  befo re about 
my  name?  I didn't say that?
 
 
That 's  oka y, you c an sa y i t now.
 
 
Zofya  Ja mo wa ___(c .145).
 
 
That's  the name  you us
ed on your papers?
 
 
On  the fa ke papers, yes.  Two 
nei ghbors at one  Sunda y a ske d me , 
how come  Vani a (? ) ( 135) J a____ 
, you don't  go to c hurc h ?   I said
 I don't have what to
 wear .  I run away fr
om home.  I had two 
dres ses , a thin dre ss underneat h a nd a hea vier dr ess on
 top.  In my schoolbag,
 that I used to go to 
school.  Th at's  all I had 
in my  hand.  So I 
said, you see, I don'
t have what to we
ar.  She says, for 
God, no ma t t er whi ch way you go, 
what you wear, is good.  So I  sa
i d, that 's it , I  ha ve t o go to 
church now.  Bernard took me  to ch
urch.  He  just took me
 t here .  He sa id go i n, a n d he  we nt  to  
wo rk .  It  wa s a  we ek day .   
I figured I'm not goin
g to go Sunda y, first  ti me .  
Just let's get acquainted. 
Thi s was  the  wee k be for e East er, wa s Spri ng of '44.
  There were a few ol d l a
die s in t he  churc h.  I  
sa w they were all kneeling.  From one holy to the 
othe r, they we nt on t he i
r  knees.  So I followed 
them, on my knees, fro m one
 holy to another.  My 
knees were killing me
 because I wasn't
 used to it .  

But I figured, if I stand up, ev
erybody will notice me .  Wh en I 
kneel, I'm a little shorter, nobody 
sees  me .  I  we nt from on
e holy like they to the 
other.  I bought a prayer
 book and I learned very 
easily, everything by heart.
  I  lear ned the prayer s, 
the words, the melody I di
dn't know bu
t the words 
I lea rne d.  The  pra yer  what  you sa
id ever yday I  l earned it  by heart  
that tonight if 
you wa ke me  up, 
today 12 o'clock at night,
 tell me, say the pr
ayer, I wo uld say it 
like those years.  
Bec aus e I  tri ed  s o  
hard to remember that  i t 's j ust  
in me already that I--.
  Even when somethin
g li ke happens, i n a  
house--l et 's s ay a  gl ass  fa lls down.  A Je wis h girl 
would sa y, Oy.  A Cat h o
lic woul d s ay, Je sus  or  
Maria or  whatever .  I  tried so hard
 t o  re me mb er th is t h
at  e ven until  t oda y, 
something fa lls down, I 
still say Jesus, Maria.  Becau
se I didn't try so hard to
 forget as I tried so hard
 to remember.  I went to 
chur ch alr ea dy one  ti me .  The  next
 day I run fast that I should ge
t to know.  It wa s like--this was 
Palm Sunday, I we nt.  This
 was like a first time, I 
went  a  Sunday.  Ber nar d 
never we nt  int o church,  
inside.  He alwa ys stayed like the 
other, you know, like people, wise 
guys, they always
 st ay out side . 
Thi s  wa s wh at was  hi m.   He  was  st
anding al ways  outsi de .  He  never 
went  i n, even on
ce.  But  I start  
goi ng from t hat ti me fait hfull y
.  I n April, and the n i n M a
y, I  wa s alr eady one  of the m.
 
 
Thi s is  a  Cat holic  c hur ch, right?
 
 
Ye s, of cour se.  I n May i s the mo
nt h of Holy Mar y.  You 
go e very ni ght  a nd sing
 songs.  I we nt i n  
May, e ver y night a nd all  the  wor ds , t he me lody-- .   I  
love to sing so
 the melody came
 very ea sy t o  
me  a nd I wa s si ngi ng my he art out  
to my God.  I figure d you must he ar me he
re too.  I was singing 
and the n one  day, one  of my neighbors was be hi
nd me , I didn't know.  
She  hear d me si ngi ng and  
then later  she sa ys, you wa s si ngi ng
 bea uti ful  in chur ch t oday.  Wa
y, was  I ha ppy that she not ice d  
me and t hat  she was t h ere.  
Since that day on I was faithful
 going every Su
nday, every--any 
occasion, I  was i n chur
c h.   I  fel t  s a fe  t he r e t oo  a n d I  fel t  al r e
ady good being there. 
 Because--first  of 
all, that I'm safe and that
 people  se e me, nei ghbor s see  me  and t h
at was very importan
t.  The n  I ha ve  
to tell you something.  In
 Stree , I us ed t o go to s tores  a nd to
 buy t hings  what I  
needed.  On e time , I  
went into a store to buy before 
Christmas, it was balloon
s.  Like to buy some
 balloons, ma ke a little 
Chr i st mas tr ee.  The lady who 
took care of me, the mi
nute  I wal ke d i n, I kne w s he 's Je wi sh. 
So me how, you fe el it.  I 
bought the balloons, I come 
home  and I unpa cke d  the 
package.  I see I have 
a wool ker chief ther e bet wee n t he bal l oons.  This
 was wort h, I  can't even 
e xpre ss you, how much a  
kerc hie f  like  thi s wa s worth.
  First of all, you have
 it to wear it, and then 
it was a very nice one, like 
a war m one so she packed it for me
.  But  I never went back to that
 stor e again.  
Never because you 
see I was afraid in case she--.  
She  wante d  pr oba bly to ma ke  a n 
acquaintance to have somebody to 
talk to.  This was the worst thing I hear from pe ople 
later.  That they
 didn't have who to
 talk.  We  at  
least, I wa s l ucky I ha d Ber nar d, t ha t
 I could talk to him.
  This was in--..  Th
en I  used t o see one 
wit h col ored ha ir whic h some  gi rl
s ma ke very big mi stake.  They 
colored their hair and then they 
coul dn't cont inue  with 
the hai r  growi ng out .  She  was goi ng 
behi nd a Ge r ma n, a  real  Ger ma n  like  
carryi ng her  bas ket wit h her food behind her .  I  
kne w ri ght  a wa y s he was  Je wis h.  I wa s looki ng,  
even now, when we go gat heri n
gs and I meet some body fr om 
Stre e a n d I  as k,
 where did you  
survi ve?   I fi gure maybe one da y, I fi nd her a nd I 'l l  te
ll her that  I saw her.  A
ll the time I saw her and 
I hoped, I say oh everything's oka
y, I still can see her, that
 she's alive.  One time
 I was caught in the 

street , j ust  for work.  Germans 
c aught me , t he y caught  ev
erybody, whoe ver, th
e young girl s, the y  
saw, they caught t hem and 
took them to work.  They
 took us for cleaning ap
artments after the Jews  
that they took them to the ghetto.  So we clea
ned and I figured, my  goodne
ss, such an i nci dent.  
How a m I  going to get  out of it?   I f I  woul d have  
known, t hat  he 's not goi ng t o kee p me , let  me go 
later a nd come ba ck, I woul
d sa y a fal se na me .  But  I was  a fraid.  
I said I have no 
papers with me.  
He  sai d go home a nd bri ng t he m.  I  c oul d have  sa id a 
false name  but I didn't.  
So this was too late.  I 
we nt home a nd j ust t old my nei ghb
ors that I--that the Germans caught
 me  a nd I ha ve to go t o wor k 
and work t h ere for  t hem.   
This was regular soldiers. 
 I figured one thing towa
r ds  me .  I  di dn't  wa nt 
to say a nyt hi ng to the m t hat I 
speak German.  I didn't 
want t o not  s pea k so whe n I  s a w no Pol i sh 
girls around, I did my work
, cleaning and this.  Wh
en I saw, I say Bitte (2
22) like a ________, like 
let me  go a n d t his .  J ust  one  wor d  he re, one  wor d  th
ere.  It  worked.  Aft er 
t he da y was  over, he  sai d, 
co me , co me  wit h me .   H e  to ok  me  to  t he o f fic e ,  
which one are your papers?  
He  took and tore  them 
up.  Agai n l ucky, you se e. 
  He  tor e up the  paper s.  I wante d to 
ta ke  one-- he said no
.  He  tore the m 
up, t hrow the m in the ba sk

Do  you reme mb er when that was?
 
 
Wh e n  t h i s  w a s?
 
 
Whe n it  ha ppened to you?
 
 
This wa s '4 3.  [" Were no Jews.  Th

In '45, '43?
 
 
'43.  We  witnessed it, th
e  de struction of t he whol e 
Je wish c o mmunit y i n Str ee.
 
 
Ca n you te ll 
me about it?
 
 
Sur e.  They wer e ma ki ng, t hey c alle d the m ac htzi  ( 234) i n Str ee , a cht
ze.  So at night,
 they wo uld get 
all t he cars  a nd SS and whoe ver  took 
care on t his , they get t he m dr unk 
fi rst.  They all were drunk .  
They came in to the ghetto and they said wh oe ver they
 caught i n the ghett o to
o.  Even in the ghetto, 
you could hi de s o me .  They ha d about si x ac htze s like 
this in Stree.  With th
e last one, they too k  
ever ybody.  The y t ook t he m out , 
out side  of town.  They
 di gged ma ss  gr a ves .  After t he wa r, we  
found one man who cra w led out wou
nded fr om t h at mass grave.  ["
I was worki ng across the street  

when they li qui date d." ]  Th
e y put up ma chi ne guns 
and they told th
em to get up--.  [" Was a grave 
by two hundred yards long.  They 
built, they put down bu
shes in both ends.  In the center, it was 
like a  cr oss- up, like a bri dge .  They
 brought t he  peopl e over  t here na
ked.  They let t he m out  fro m  
the truck and they closed 
the t hing.  The machi ne gun
 s hot  the m down.  One go
t hit in the leg but he  
fall down in the grave.  When th
ey finished with everyt hing, I we
nt , I  fini she d work, I  went  over  
there across the street.  
The grave was still 
moving.  You see, the dirt
 was still movi
ng. because  
people were still alive.  
One person, a young guy, wh
en he got hit, he knew 
was on top.  They left . 
So he  r un a w ay and s o
me how, he sur v ived." ]
 
 
He  s urvi ved ?
 
 
Ye s, he survived, he wa
s wounde d.  Some body hel pe d hi m la

[" Whe n t hey liqui dat ed t he ghett o, it wa s a r ain." ]  
This was later.  [" Wa s a 
rainy day.  You see in  
the  bl oc k, we we re  not  fa r, we  liv

,  t he  water  wa s  re

what they got k

s streams of red wa

ugh town.  Before 
this ha ppe ne d, on a pre vi ous  ac htza , one  girl , li ke  
today I see her, she j u mp
ed out fr om a truck and 
wa s running, running.  Just
 r unning, r unning.  The  police  was  
s hooting, s hooting a
nd she run away. 
I don't know if she 
survived or not but she run 
away.  Yo u see after the ghe
tt o, they already--afte r  
this when the water was ru
nning, that red water and 
they closed the ghetto. 
 But they still kept the 
youngest a n d the strongest 
in barr ac ks.  We c ould see from wh
ere we lived, we saw it fr om our  
window.  We see them 
all the time still working,
 they still work there. 
 They still up there and 
fi nall y t he y  ca me  one  ni ght-- .  ["In t he  be ginni ng,

She  wa s t he onl y one  who s urvi ve d?
 
 
The Pole, the Pole.  You see the Polish peopl e in St

they helped more Jews  
than in the other pa rts of
 Poland.  Becaus
e  t hey we re prosec ute d by t he  Ukr ainia ns.  The  Ukr ainia ns

e Ger mans start March of 
'44, t he  Russia ns start  
coming close and the Ge rmans run away. They came back
 lat er.  We  were afra
id there  would be  bi g 

fi ghting in Stree.  We  
had one neighbor, sh
e was fr om a Polish village am
ong the Ukrain
ian villages 
there, about 17 miles 
outside of Stree.  
They say t hey goi ng t h ere so we
 sa y, c an we  go wit h  you?  
Okay, you c an go w
ith us.  We  we nt t here  wi
th them.  We stayed there with them.  There was 
undergr ound, a  Polis h undergr ound. 
 Ber nar d j oined t he Polish unde
r ground.  He was a l ready li ke--
this was already another thing fo
r us .  He  was  in the under ground
 working for them.  They were 
ever yda y guarding the  vi llage  with just
 li ke ba yonets.  Every ni ght  the y
 ha d to gua rd the r e.  But  t he y  
had-- act ually the y ha d gre nades, the Poles .
  They had some  gu
ns, they had some--.
 
 
Oh, t his  is  in the  undergr ound?
 
 
Thi s is t he under ground, yes .  
We were there alr e ady wi th t hem. 
 Now the meetings
 they make in 
our-- where v er we li ve d.  We  lived 
by the peasants, we went to work with them, we helped them and 
this i s how we  ha d alrea dy what  to
 eat and we were there.
  We  didn't fe el like goi
ng bac k t o Str e e. 
We  are  alre a dy here .  I he lped the m di g potat oes  ou
t in the--you know, wo rk 
in the fields.  Then one 
day they say they have to bring three guns from St
ree.  They chose Bernard,
 he should go, he's  in 
char ge t o br ing the  three  guns , big 
ri fles, not guns, ri fles.  Three ri
fl es  fro m St r e e.   [" The y w e re  
good for  not hing." ]  We went  ther e an
d we have t o pick up t he ri fles 
in a pl ace.  He we
nt to pick up  
the riles from where the place with 
me.  Ho w should we  carry
 three ri fl es t hrough 
the town of Stree?  
So he went into a neighbor.  He 
said could you lend me 
a quilt, like a big quilt?
  I bring it back to 
you.  He sai d fi ne.  We  go and get 
t hat quilt , he packed up t h ere t he 
t hree  rifl es, ma ke a bi g bundle .  
He gives me  to
 carry because a woma n always 
a little bit safe r than
 a man.  I carry 
but he is behind 
me .  Li ke  a  dista nce  but  he  coul
dn't  help me  in a ny 
wa y  i f  th e Ge r man s  wo uld  catc h  me  wit h  th e  
riles but he  would know at lea st wh
er e I am.  I  walk 
with the riles, I come hom
e be fore hi m.  One  of 
the neighbor s with a Ukrainian husband, she see me
 comi ng wit h  such a bi
g bundle .   What  woul d I 
be ca rryi ng?   She fi gur e d maybe some stor es t h
ey ope ned up and you c oul d ge t s o me thi ngs , 
something worthwhile.  
She said what do y
ou ha ve  there?   I  sai d none  of
 your business  what  I ha ve  
there .  I fi gur ed like thi s, one sec ond
 only to think.  I fi gur ed if she 
sees what  I have then t hat 's dead, 
that, ten times dead.  But 
if she doesn't  see so I  fi
gured she comes over once 
more and as ks me , I hit  
her like with all my streng
th like this and say get lo
st.  Just leave me alone.  I went to the basement 
and I  l ocked the riles and I  figure 
t hat  he 's  goi ng t o come  soon.  
He  s o me h ow will  
handle it.  Now  
how to tell her.  We  can't 
tell her we have the rifl es. 
 This is what I had.  We
 can't tell her the truth  
so Bernard walk--he ha d an idea.  
He called in that neighbor who le
nd hi m that bl anket.  He s ai d  
come, come to the 
hous e, get your  bla nket .  He
 pul ls up the bla nket and he r e 
the t hree ri fles fall .  He 
says  my goodness , wha t  are you 
doing?   He s ays some body has  to
 do it.  We  have to defe nd 
ours elves.  She sa w, s he  t ook t he bla n
ket, we nt ba ck t o t he  ot her neighb
or.  This is the 
real patriots. 
What  do you thi nk what  t hey doi ng?
   She  di dn't  have  to-- ma ybe  she  coul d ha ve  t old her  but  we 
coul dn't.
 
 
Not hi ng was  ever s aid a b out--?
 
 

Not hi ng e ve r  wa s sa id a bout it-- not hing c a me be caus e
 we ar e the r eal fi ghter s.  Then was a sick  
woman in the hospital so th
e  sic k  woma n, we  ha d t o  
take back to th
at  vi llage .  We  
put the rifles  
underneath her.  We put  
he r on top and Ger ma n s all  over ,  walk
ing and doing--.  
We walked just  
behi nd t hat  wa gon, t he  17 mil es  a n
d we  brought the rifles 
there.  Th is gave us--also was a very good 
thing, prest i ge that i f I would be
, le t 's s ee, anybody would drea m 
that I 'm J e wis h, woul d I not be  
afr aid t o go t o Stre
e and bring ri fles?  I  would 
be afr aid even t o show my
 f ace.  This was--you had  
to make yourself like--all 
the time more secure a little
 bit.  Later, when I used
 to go to church, I use d  
to s pea k t o people , I wa s alre ady s o sure of my
self that only if some
body wo uld come  wh o kne w 
me--.  Otherwise, I wa s ve
ry s ure .  I  tell you about one  incident
.  One of the neig
hbors once said, 
wh en they were giving ou
t the kenn cards which is with the pi ct
ure s all  the  Ger ma ns-- s o he  sa id, he  
says  to me, t hey're gi ving out  ke nn 
car ds.  The y gi ve out blues to Uk
r aini ans, Poli sh me n get gr ays. 
I al most wanted to sa y, by us  
they gave out yellow.  But a good 
t hing, I was br ought up good and I  
fi gured let him fi nish.  He  said, 
and Jews they give ye
llow.  I fi gure d  thi s wa s  a  cl os e one .  The n  
anot her  inci dent  I  had-- one  neighbor se es  me  dri
nki ng c o ffee  and biti ng 
sugar, you know cubes of 
sugar you bite a piece, you
 drink a little coffee.
  Another time, I was eati
ng sauerkraut and I sprayed 
sugar on it.  Both times 
one or the  ot her s aid, J e ws
 eat  like t hat .  You see yo
u had e ven t o be care ful  
what you eat  and how you eat .  I  thr o w away t he s
ugar  and I never dri nk c o ff
ee since t hat day, even 
until today fr om biting the 
sugar.  Wh o would ever th
ought of that?  
Not to eat that 
way because this 
mi ght-- .  We  had a not her  thi ng t oo, a n i nci dent .  
We  ha d a curtain in our  
window.  The curtain was 
so put up, t h at from one side it  
was down.  Before Bernard entered 
t he house , he al wa ys l ooked at  
the window, at the curtain.
  I f anythi ng would ha ve
 ha ppene d  to me , let 's  
say Gestapo comes, they 
take  me  a w ay.  I f  anyt hing woul d have ha ppe ned,
 I  would have  st raighten
ed out that curtain. 
Bec ause  to t ake  off, would be  s o met h ing s us picious, 
but  t o  str aight en out , I wo
uld strai ghte n  out  thi s  
curtai n.  He would know he can't 
come in the house anymor
e.  This we  had our 
si gn.  This was  ours  
be for e  we  went  int o  the house .  So
 thaat you lived and to 
thi nk a nd you ha d to pla y  like  on a  st age .  
Not one word you should sa
y.  Do you know that af
t er th e war , whe n I met  
the first Jews I couldn't 
spea k J ewish?   I mea n, t h e 
first fe w minutes.  They say, they talk
 to me  Je wi sh a nd I t r y t o ans wer, I  
can't.  Then it da
wned on me .  I say I  probab
l y for got , wait a mi nute  and I
--.  That same evening, I  
wa s spe aki ng t o the m, Je wish.  You know, so met i me s
 I tried at night to sa
y a Je wis h  word, how it  
sounds.  Li ke I never  he ard s ayi ng 
this, it sounds so wond
erful.  I never, I ne
ve
r wanted to think 
even that way, neve
r--.  Any books I had, a littl
e thing, like a Po
le thinks, what 
would he do and 
what woul d- -.  ["In the place  
whe r e  I was  wor k ing , wa s wo rkin

come to your story, you'r e 
not goi ng to ha ve what t o

We 'll  ge t t o your st or y i n  a mi nut e.
 
 
["I wo uldn't tell you the story"].   He
 wouldn't tell you, he 
just likes to tell when
 I talk.  That's the 
story of his life .
 
 

Why don't you tell me about wh
en the Russians come  in?
 
 
You me a n li berate d us?
 
 
Ye s, is t her e anyt hing els e?
 
 
Ye s.  I wa s--
 
 
Is there something else you want to
 t e ll me , go a hea d but  we  ca n move
 on to that if that's--.  You 
said they were coming
 close in March '44. 
 
 
Yes.  I mean when I--.  I j ust wa
nt t o t ell you t hat afte
r the war when I came  ba
ck to Ulanow, I came 
back when the Russians still were--.
  The Russians came al
ready to that part 
where I was.  There  
was no communication so 
I came  with Russians trucks.  I jus st
opped the m and t hey
 hel ped me and 
this and I came to Ulanow.  I 
was thinki ng, my goodness , my 
he art was  poundin
g.  I  met  some  
Polish people but I didn
't want to ask them.  I fi
gured as long as 
I don't ask, I still ha
ve hope.  Once I 
ask them and they tell me 
nobody's t here, maybe.  So
 I don't want t o know unt
i l I---.  I came on t h e 
sa me  ferr y a nd the sa me  guy r ecogni
z ed me but he  took me
 i n 1942, t he  ot her  wa
y.  He  says to me , 
and you'r e al ive!  Anothe r one says, e verybody pa id
 one zloty.  He said fro
m her, you s hould ta ke  
two zlotys.  This was my
 welcome.  Then anothe
r said, you see it's  not 
a  ba g, you go in and you  
can't go out .  She  we nt  i n an
d she came out.  Everybody was ma
ki ng s o me  fun and some thi ng. 
The n fi nall y I br ought mysel f  and 
I  asked t hat ma n who wa
s in charge of t hat
 ferr y and I  sa y, i s  
anybody fr om my  family 
alive in town?  He said, not from 
your fa mily and not  a ny other  Je w is  
alive.  But in the next  town, in
 Cz ____ (c .461) , t here  is  one  fa mi
ly who survived the war.  They 
burie d al mos t  in a gra ve and t he y 
ca me out.  I  went t o
 our house strai ght and all t he c hildre n wer e  
running a fte r me.  A Je wis h gi rl, 
a Je wish girl ca me b
ack!  Oh, it was awful. 
 But I went to the 
house  and t h en I  we nt t o anot her  
pe rs on what  I knew.  I a sked hi m 
a nd a  ne ighbor .  The y a ske d me  
if I 'm hungry.  I  sa y no, now they
 as k me  i f I ' m hungr y.  The n I  we
nt out of town, about a fe w miles  
there  wa s  one li ke  plea sa nt
er people, we  were clos
er  with.  The Russi ans we
re all over.  The army  
was all over and I crie
d bitterly.  I couldn't tale a word.  On
e Pole came over to
 me who was very 
good frie nds  with my fa t her, he was  
a rich ma n, he  wasn't  just  anyb
ody more intellige
nt.  He  put his 
hand on my shoulder, he  said, my
 c hil d, you ha ve not hing t o l o ok he
re fo r.  You ge
t lost from here 
and don't ever co me back here be
cause you might be kille
d too.  He said, you ha
ve nothing to look, 
you're  not  going t o fi nd anyt hing. 
 They were all  kill ed.  Then I  
wen t  bac k.   I  we nt--it  was  alre ad y  
eve ning, I  was goi ng t o  t hat  Cs__
___(484)  to fi nd the Gers ons  who 
survived.  I stayed with them 
like ove rni g ht.  The n I we nt bac k to
 Stree because I j ust  came her e t o
 see if anybody's alive to tell 
because Be rnard wa s still 
there to say that nobody'
s alive.  You asked me  
before how it wa s when 
the Russi an came i n.  I t
 was very unpleasant  experience.  Th
e Russians, we see 
t he Russia ns, we  

happy the Russia ns  ca me in for  a not her t w o, thr
ee days.  Th e Germans were
 mo ving out.  They 
even tried to take me along, I sh
ould help them, the ca
ttle to, you know, to ta
ke with them, to hurt 
them.  It wa s at night, I wa s layi
ng i n bed a nd t h ey tr
ied to-- my heart wa s pu
mping like this and I 
fi gur e i f  the y  kill  me here , I don't 
go out fr om that bed. 
 I s aid t o hi m, look, 
look, how my heart is--
I'm sick.  I can't, even one step I 
ca n't  put  on the  fl oor , I ' m just sick.  
Th ey let me  and they left.  Then 
three days later ca me the Russians
.  They came  in and 
two Russians soldiers 
who had tanks, like 
tanks fr om t ank di visi ons hi de  ou
t for the few days.  Th
ey figure t he Russian 
goi ng to come .  The y  
came out and they happy to
 welcome them.  The firs
t t hing he a sk t he m, wher
e a r e your tanks?   He  
killed them on the spot.  
We start running away.  We
 didn't know what happ
ened?  He killed the 
two Russi ans--the  s oldi e rs who-- he  a ske d t he m w hat
 the y--t he y c oul dn't  help
 it.  We  know it that 
they c oul dn't  hel p t o  sa ve the 
t a n ks,  wh ere  wo ul d t hey
 save.  So  between th
e busine ss, with thi s, 
they s urvi ve d.  The y come  out and 
they are here.  So  th
is wa s the first welcome from the Russi ans.  
 
 
Thi s wa s i n 1944?
 
 
This wa s in '44, yes.  
 
 
What  di d you do a fter  the Rus s
ians came in?  Is that when
 you we nt bac k to Ula now?
 
 
Yes, after that, I went ba
ck to Ulanow.  Still with
 the war was going on, of 
course.  I wa
s trying to 
fi nd out.  You know, even going to
 Ula now, I  st opped by 
in some inn to buy something, mi lk or 
something.  The wo man start to ta
lking to me  Je wish.  She was a 
Poli sh-- she  aske d 
me something,  
some  Je wis h  word, are you 
Je wish.  I  sai d no.  I  was stil l a fr aid
.  I  di dn't say anyt
hi ng.  While  I wa s  
going to Ulanow, what I to
ld you, when the 
Russians came in, I was goin
g a little walki
ng, a little--. 
One day when I walked a 
little, a piece of my 
road, there was a Je
wish-Russian soldier, officer, like 
a high offi ce r ra nki ng and a  plai n 
soldier.  The officer 
was sitting on the wag
on and the soldier was 
wal king be hind the  wa gon.
  I fi gur e d ma ybe when 
t he y st art  going fa ster , 
ma ybe they'll take me  
along t oo.  I  put  my pac kage wha t
 I have on t he wa gon.  Li ke star
ting to think ah
ead.  The soldi e r  
tells me, the Russian soldie
r tells me , you know, this 
one is a Je w,  this officer
.  See he's riding, he 
wo uldn't wa lk.  I see the 
love the soldier had for 
t hat  Russian officer, I 
figured I'm not saying 
anything that I'm Jewish, not
hing.  Until I go back
, I go there, I was still afraid
 to say.  Even after we  
came back, later after '45, we 
came back to Rozwadow, we lived
 a little while th
ere before we 
emigrated.  I was afraid.  Bernar d meet me and he 
says that he registered 
already as a Jew, I said 
what did you do?   Like  I was  a fr aid
 to say even wa s like  
al most  after the war.  [" After the war, we  
lived in Pola nd for fi ve years unde
r false name."]  Yeah, 
we still didn't, we  di
dn't admit to ourselves 
until we emigrated.  
 
 
So  you lived after 1945, you li
ved in Poland for fi ve years?
 

 
Yeah, we lived still until '56, 
'57.  '57, we emig
rated.  Three years we
 were in Israel.
 
 
Thr ee year s, you emi grat e d t o Israel?
 
 
Ye s, be caus e we couldn't go.  We 
wa nt t o e mi grate  to Uni t ed Stat es .  I ha d here  t wo a unt s, my 
mother 's sist er and 
my father 's siste r .  We  
wanted to go to the Unite
d States but we  couldn't go 
straight.  So we  went  t hrough Is rael .
 
 
Then in 1960 
you came here?
 
 
In '6 0 we  came  here, yes.
  Since t hen we live here
 in Br ooklyn, New York.  
 
 
I t hink we 'r e a l most  done.  The  on
ly thing I want to as
k you--.  I want to
 go back, you said 
somet hing a bout your fat her
.  What  di d your fa ther  do, what  wa s hi s professi on?
 
 
My father  was li ke  for hi
msel f in busi ness.  He bo
ught l and and sol d and fe ed
 to--woods, things like 
that.  We were lik

That 's  all  the  questi ons I  have.  Is
 t her e a nyt hing you want  to s ay?
 
 
No , thank you.
 
 
Thank you.
