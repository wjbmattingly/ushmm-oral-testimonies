help with her  intr oduc tion.
 
 
We begin with this photograph of J os ianne Aizenberg walking on a
 
str eet in Brus s els.
 
 
J os ie was  born Mar c h 21, 1939, in Br us s els , to J ac ques and Fanny Aizenberg. The arr ow on 
this  map of Belgium points  to Brus s els .
 
 
The Germ an Arm y c onquer ed Belgium  in May
 
1940. Shortly befor e the occ upation, J os ie's 
father left Belgiu
m to join the Br itis h Ar my. In this photo we s ee J os ie with her  par ents in Bruss els .
 
In 1942, J os ie's  mother, Fanny, was  able to s ec ure a hiding plac e for J os ie in a c onvent in Br ugges, 

Belgium . Here we s ee J os ie and Fanny, s hor tly before J os ie went into hiding. Soon thereafter, Fanny, 

who worked with the Belgian Undergr ound, the res is tanc e, was  denounc ed and s he was  deported to 
Aus c hwitz.
 
 
After s ix m onths  of hiding in the c onvent and growing Nazi s uspic ion, the Belgian 
Under gr ound r eloc ated Jos ie to hide with the Debrackalaer family,
 
a Chris tian fam ily in Brus s els. Her e

we s ee J os ie with the Debr ackalaers. Mr. and Mr s . Debr ackalaer are on the right. To their left are 
neighbor s of J os ie's  grandparents. Their grands on is  in the front in the middle with J os i
e to the right. 
The Debrackalaer's daughter is  on the left.
 
 
Allied Forc es liber ated Belgium  in Septem ber
 
1944. Soon after, J os ie was  found by one of her 
aunts , who was  one of Fanny's  s is ters . Her e we see J os ie, J acques, and Fanny after they were 

r eunited 
in Belgium.
 
 
J os ie would eventually m ar ry Fr eddie Traum, als o a Holoc aus t s ur vivor . We c los e with this  
wedding por tr ait of Jos ie and Fr eddie.
 
          
 
After m oving to the United States  with her par ents in 1949 and then c om pleting her s c hooling 
in Patter son, New J er s ey, J os ie went to Isr ael to study for a year. On the r etur n trip on a s hip s he met 

Fr eddie Tr aum , the s hip's  Chief Radio Offic er, who was  als o a Holoc aus t sur vivor. Upon her return to 

the U.S., J os ie attended Montc lair  State Teac hers' College for one year . J os ie and Freddie wer e 
m arried on his s hip a year after  s he m et him  and s he moved to Is r ael where they lived for five years . 
While in Isr ael, the Tr aum's s on Mic hael and daughter Yael wer e bor n.
 
          
 
Upon the advic e of m edic al experts  in
 
Isr ael, the Tr aum s re
-
loc ated to the United States in 
1963 to obtain m edic al car e for their dis abled s on, Mic hael
. 
Their thir d c hild, J onathan, who als o is  
dis abled, was  born in the U.S. Eventually, Freddie's  work brought them to Vienna, Virginia
. 
J os ie 
r
etur ned to s c hool and graduated fr om  the Catholic  Univer s ity of Amer ic a Sc hool of Soc ialWork  and 
began her c areer  in c hild welfar e. She r etired in 2007 fr om her work  as  a clinic al s oc ial wor ker for  
abus ed c hildr en for Montgom er y County, Maryland.
 
          
 
Today, Jos ie and Fr eddie live in Silver Spr ing, Mar yland. J os ie's volunteer wor k  at this  
m us eum inc ludes leading tour s  of the Per manent Exhibition for  law enforcement inc luding polic e 

officers , the FBI, judges and other s . J osie s peaks public ly about her
 
experienc e as  a Holoc aust s urvivor  
in var ious  s ettings, espec ially loc al s ynagogues and s c hools  in Maryland and Virginia
. 
Marc h J os ie and 
two fellow Holoc aus t Survivors  joined m e at the Amer ic an Soc iety on Aging's  annual c onferenc e to 

s peak  about res ilienc y and aging.
 
          
 
I'm pleas ed to let you know that Fr eddie is  here with J os ie today.
 
          
 
With that I would like you to join m e in welc om ing our Fir st Per s on, J os ie Tr aum.
 
> >  [Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J os ie, thank  you s o m uc h for  joining us
 
today and being willing to be our
 
First P er s on
. 
You have a gr eat deal to tell us in a ver y s hort per iod of tim e s o we will get started.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Ok .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your parents , Fanny and J acques , were m arr ied in ear ly 1938, and you were born in
 

Marc h 1939, jus t m onths before Germany and Rus s ia attacked Poland, launc hingWorld War II. Tell us  
about your  par ents  and their life in Br us s els , Belgium , in that pr e
-
wartime.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Well, they both c am e fr om  pretty traditional fam ilies , J ewis h 
families . They got 
m arried. They wer e happy. They both had profes sions . My dad was a tailor and m y m om  was  a 
des igner, dres s des igner. And s he was  ac tually
 
--
 
before s he m ar r ied, s he was  a designer for  the 
Belgium  r oyal family, c lothes
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  
A huge honor .
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  It was  a huge honor . My mom went to a school where they taught you textile and 
des igning. And when you graduate, the gr aduating c las s , the r oyal family  would c om e and ask a few of 
the students  to c om e and wor k  for  the royal hous ehold. So s he did work 
for 
them, whic h was  a big deal
 
a
t that time.
 
 
So my parents  wer e married. They were r elatively  happy. Things  wer e relatively quiet in 
B elgium.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You mentioned your father  was  a tailor . Tell us  his firs t oc c upation.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  [Laughter ] My dad was  ac tual
 
--
 
is
 
--
 
was  a violinis t. Believe it or  not, m any year s  ago, 
in his  time, the movies  wer e s ilent. They wer e not talkies . So they us ually, bec aus e there was  nobody 

talking, us ually had a m usic al quar tet accompanying the m ovie that was  s howing. So my dad would 

play the 
v
iolin, along with three other m us ic ians. He had pr etty s teady wor k  bec aus e whenever  there 

3 
 
was  a m ovie, he would be hir ed and play. Howev er, the talkies  c am e. The m ovies  s tarted having 
talkies, people talked and they didn't need these m us ic ians  anymor e. So all of thes e mus ic ians  wer e 
fir ed. So m y dad actually  went to s c hool to welc om e
 
--
 
to learn to bec om e a tailor . That's  how he really 
worked as a tailor .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Hitler and the Nazis  c am e t o power  in Germany in 1933. Your parents mar ried in 1938. 
Nazi power in Germ any and Aus tr ia took  a m ore om inous  tur n in late 1938 with Kr is tallnac ht or the 

Night of Br oken Glas s, and you wer e bor n just a few months  later  in March 1939, just beforeWor ld Wa
r 
II br oke out. Do you know if your parents, when they wer e hav ing you, befor e your birth, do you 

know
 
--
 
and then after your  birth
 
--
 
do you know if your  par ents ever expr ess ed later to you how fearful 
they wer e about the future or life given all that was
 
happening s o c los e by? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  I'm s ure they wer e. I think it was  a ver y prec arious  tim e for anyone not k nowing what 

was  going to happen. My  par ents , of c ours e, heard about Kris tallnac ht, whic h happened in 1938 when 
all the J ewis h property and synagogues were burned. So I think  there was a lot of wor r y at the tim e. 
And m y par ents  us ed to lis ten to the r adio and they would get a lot of r adio mes s ages from the BBC or 
fr om  England asking people, m en, to c ome and volunteer  to be in the Br itis h Army. 
So I think m y 
par ents had talked about my dad per haps going to the Britis h Ar m y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  After Kris tallnac ht, I think  your par ents took  a J ewis h child in to live with you for a 

per iod of time. Is that r ight?
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  They did. And even 
after wards , until things  really got ver y bad in Belgium, The 
Germ ans were ac tually oc c upier s
 
--
 
things wer e m uch wors e for J ews  in different c ountr ies like Poland 
and Romania. There wer e J ews  trying to flee those c ountr ies . So my mother
 
--
 
this is after my
 
dad left. 
My m other would have people
 
--
 
s he was  really par t of the underground. What s he would do, s he would 
get people, J ews , that were tr ying to flee from  Belgium  and they would s leep over  at our hous e until 

they would find another safe plac e where they c ould be for  a little while. Maybe going to Switzer land, 
Portugal or Spain. But we often would have J ews who wer e fleeing other countries  c om ing to live or to 
be or s leep in our  plac e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Have a s afe r efuge for  s om e period of tim e.
 
> > Josie
 
Traum:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J os ie, of c our s e,Wor ld War II began with the Germ an attac k  on Poland in 
September
 
1939. But the war c am e to Brus s els in Belgium in May
 
1940 when the Ger mans  attacked. 
Called the low c ountr ies , Belgium, The Netherlands  and Fr
anc e. Your father  left to join the Br itis h Ar my. 
What do you know about his  leaving and what happened to him at that point
? 
And now it's  just you and 
your  mom. What happened then? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Right. Ac tually, Germ any invaded four  c ountries in one day
, May
 
10, 1940, they 
invaded Holland, Belgium, Luxem b
o
urg and Fr anc e. And thos e c ountr ies fell pr etty m uc h im mediately. 
And the Germ ans  took over.
 
 
My par ents  had heard c alls  from  the Britis h asking people to volunteer  and join the Br itish 
Ar m y. And my dad
 
ac tually decided he and his  brother
 
--
 
his  br other was  also a tailor. So he and his  
br other, my unc le, dec ided to go to Br itain and to join the Br itis h Arm y. However , during that tim e in the 

1940s
 
--
 
in 1940, the Germ ans  wer e bombing the Englis h c hannel and r eally were bombing boats that 
were trying to get to England. So my dad ac tually went on one of the last boats  that left to cr os s the 

Englis h Channel to get into England. So actually my dad and his brother both got to England in 1940.
 
At that time, actu
ally, bec aus e of all the bom bing and the war s tar ting, m y m om had no idea if my dad 
ever  got ther e to England. Ther e was
 
--
 
you c ouldn't c omm unic ate bec aus e of the war. So my mom  
ac tually never  knew if my dad ever  made it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And later  we'll c om e back to what you would find out m uc h later.
 
 
You and your  mother  would r em ain in Br us s els, living in an oc c upied c ity, in an oc c upied 
c ountr y, under Nazi oc c upation, until 1942 when your mother  m ade a profound dec is ion to put you into 

hiding. Tell us 
what you c an about the events  leading up to that, what your mother 's and your 
c irc umstanc es wer e like that eventually got her to the plac e where she s aid I've got to hide m y c hild.

> > Jos ie Tr aum:  Sur e. Obvious ly things got very, ver y bad in Belgium. The Ger mans  wer e r eally all 
over . People had to c arry identific ation c ar ds. J ews  had to wear  stars. Things r eally bec am e ver y 
diffic ult and ver y har d.
 
Onc e m y dad left, I was  with my mom. We were living in an attic apartment with 
m y m aternal gr andparents , m y m
om's par ents . We wer e ac tually pr etty m uc h to our selves  and living 
ther e.
 A
nd, of c ours e, as I m entioned before, we had s ome people c om ing and staying over  for a few 
days  until they went s ome els e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had gr eat grandparents as  well at tha
t time. Didn't you?
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  No. J us t gr andparents.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Jos ie Tr aum:  My father 's parents  died ac tually just befor e the war. So we were with my mom's  
par ents. I was  with my mom's par ents. And things really got pr etty diffic ult. My m om  dec ided, whic h I
, 
now
 
being a grandmother
, 
r ealize how har d it mus t have been for her to dec ide to let me go. Not only 
did s he dec ide to let me go but when you're having your  c hild hidden, you r eally
 
--
 
the parent, m y 
m other , was  not allowed to know
 
wher e I was  going bec aus e they knew when the Germ ans  would 
c om e s ay to your apartment, to where you were living, they would ac tually torture you to find out where 

the r es t of your fam ily was , you know, wher e your  c hildr en, where is  your hus band. So it was
 
dec ided 
by the undergr ound that par ents wer e not allowed to know and wer e not told wher e their c hildren were 

going. So m y m other had the c onnection bec ause s he was  part of the undergr ound, hiding people. She 

had c onnec tions and was  able to get people to com e and pick me up, whic h is  what they did in 1942 
when I was  3 year s  old.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we c ontinue on about that I wanted to ask  you about a c ouple of other things. 

Am ong the m any, m any, m any r estric tion and hars h edic ts is s ued by the Nazis  direc ted at J ews , one of 
them is  that you c ould not us e the health s ervic es  that wer e available.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So Belgium had a s eries  of health c linic s  for mother s  and young infants . So what did 

that m ean to you?
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  I
 
was n't able to get any c ar e. You know, es pec ially from a newbor n till 3 year s  old, 
you're going to your c linic , pediatric ian, getting your s hots  and everything els e that you need. So, of 
c our se, me, m ys elf and any of the other  c hildr en, were not allowed t o rec eive any kind of m edic al help 
or  tr eatm ent.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And befor e you went into hiding, bec aus e you were s o young, you s aid that you had 

jus t som e fleeting memor ies . You've told m e about one of being I think  on a bus with your m other? 
 
> > J os ie 
Tr aum:  Yeah. As  I mentioned befor e, onc e the Germ ans  oc c upied, we had to have 
identific ation c ar ds. And in the identific ation c ards, it actually
 
--
 
if you wer e a J ew, ther e was  a large J  
and als o the wor d 
ﬁ J
ude
,ﬂ  
whic h m eans J ew in Frenc h. Everybody had t o have an identific ation c ard. If 
you wer e walking in the s tr eet or going any wher e, the German c ould stop you and ask for your ID car d. 
And when they took your c ard and if they did s ee you were J ewis h, they could ar rest you, deport you, 
whatever  they wante
d to do.
 

 
One day my m om and I wer e on a tr am in Belgium . They didn't have bus es  in thos e days . 
There were tr am s  that wer e elec tric . My m om  and I s at in the tram . We wer e in the last row s itting in the 

tr am  and a German c ame, a Nazi c ame, on the tram  and went r ow by r ow as king for  your  identity card. 
So my mother was  s haking. She was  pretty s c ared. And, of c our s e, I didn't know why. I was  just 3 
year s  old. And the German went fr om row to row as king for  the ID c ar d. When he got to the last row 
wher e m y m om and I were s itting, he jus t turned around and got off the tram . I don't k now why but 
s om ebody m ust have been looking out for m e.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  And as you s aid, your  mom then made the dec is ion to put you into hiding. She had the 
c onnec tions  to do that. And as  you als o s aid, as a mother and a grandm other, tr ying to im agine
 
--
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  I c an't.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Has your  m other
 
--
 
did s he ever  tell you what it was  like for her  when s he m ade that 
dec is ion to put you into hiding, k nowing
 
--
 
not knowing 
wher e s he would ever
 
--
 
whether  s he would ever  
s ee you again?

> > J os ie Tr aum:  She didn't tell m e at the time.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of c our se not.
 
> > Jos ie Tr aum:  Of c ours e. But s he did later  on. It m us t have been trem endous ly har d. I don't know 
how s he did it but s he did, thank goodnes s . Bec aus e I'm her e today bec aus e of that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And the undergr ound then took  you and found a hiding plac e for  you in a c onvent.
 
> > Jos ie Tr aum:  Two wom en c ame to pick me up. All I know is  I was  s c reaming and c rying
 
bec aus e I 
didn't want to leave my m om and my grandm a. Thes e two s trange ladies took  me to a c onvent in a 
plac e c alled Br ugges
 
--
 
whic h is  beautiful, full of c anals . They c all it the Venic e of Belgium. Full of 
c onvents . They took  m e to this  c onvent whic h w
as  m ore like an orphanage. 
 
 
In thos e days , wartim e, ther e was  no
 
--
 
food was  r ationed. People had a very diffic ult time 
feeding their kids . So what they would do is  they would put their c hild in an orphanage until, perhaps , 
things got better and thr eaten they would pic k  them up. At least they would be safe. 
 
 
So this  or phanage or c onvent was  full of c hildren. And unbeknowns t to me, I found this  out 
after  the war , ther e wer e thr ee other  J ewis h c hildren there. So all the c hildren were Chr is tian exc ept for 
th
e four J ewis h c hildr en. And this  was  r un by nuns .
 
 
The nuns , in thos e days , you know, nuns  didn't dres s
 
--
 
today nuns  dr es s like we do, in 
ever yday c lothing. In thos e days  they were very s tiff habits. I'm s ur e most of you have s een "The 
S
ound 
of 
M
usic." W
ell, the nuns were dr es s ed jus t like the nuns  in "The Sound of Music ," very s tiff, ver y kind 
of tight. 
 

 
And thes e nuns  wer e very, ver y s tr ic t. Not bec ause I was  J ewis h. They wer e strict to all the 
kids. But, you know, they were risking their  lives  by taking m e in. If a German found any per s on hiding a 

J ew, they would jus t s hoot them on the spot, no ques tions  asked. They would just s hoot you.
 
So thes e 
nuns , they were s tr ic t but they s aved my life. And thes e s am e nuns  found out that the Germ ans  were 
going to
 
c ome and pick  up the four  J ewis h c hildren who wer e ther e. I don't know what they would have 
done with the c hildr en but the nuns
 
--
 
ac tually, when they found out, they sm uggled the four of us  out, 
bac k  to Br uss els , whic h is  actually where I was  from . They s m uggled us out to Br us s els  and plac ed me 
with a Chr istian family. I think you s aw the s lide s how, the Debr ack alaer s . I was  with them the entire 
dur ation of the war, until Belgium  was  liber ated.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Before you tell us about your  life with the 
Debr ackalaers , you s tayed in the c onvent for 
about a year . You wer e ther e for quite a while.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  I was  there for, yes , a bit under a year.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During that time I think you had
 
--
 
your  nam e was  c hanged.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Yes .
 
>> Bil
l Bens on: What was  it c hanged to and why
 
--
 
ther e was  s ome s ignific ance about that.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Well, firs t of all, m y m aiden name, the name I was  born with, Aizenber g, although it's 
a Ger man nam e, it was  a J ewis h name. So my nam e, my identity, was  c
hanged 
to a more Germ an or 
Dutc h
-
s ound
ing name whic h was  Von Berg. So I was  s till J os ianne, m y firs t nam e, but it was  Von Berg, 
whic h had a totally different c onnotation. So, yes , m y nam e was  c hanged.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  So while you're ther e for  one full year, c onditions , they are s tric t, as you s aid, food is  
r ationed. Thes e ar e harsh
 
c onditions .
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tr ying to take c are of you. They believe they ar e about to be found out and they have 
you m oved out. So you go to live with the Debrackalaer s. You would s pend, as you s aid, the dur ation of 
the war with them . Tell us  about the Debrack alaer  family bec aus e they, too, pres um ably, wer e risking 
their  lives  as well.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Of c ours e. The man, Mr .
 
Debrackalaer, ac tually was  pa
rt of the underground als o. I 
don't know what he was  doing but he obvious ly was  doing all kinds  of things to ups et the German plans  

or  to thwart them. And very often he would be taken out for  inter rogation. I remem ber him c om ing bac k  
in the morning black and blue bec aus e they would beat him . But he never told on m e.
 
 
They risked their lives . Food was  als o r ationed, so they got food
 
--
 
you would go to a plac e to 
pic k  up food onc e a week . And there wer e thr ee people in that fam ily. I was  there illegally, s o I
 
was  not

lis ted s o they would get food for  three people for a week and they would s har e that with me. So they 
r eally ris ked their lives  and kept m e alive.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you have any ins ight or s ense of how they explained your  pr es enc e to anybody 

els e
 
that might k now that you wer e in their  hous e? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  I r eally
 
--
 
I didn't go out very muc h. I was n't awar e of any neighbor s  ar ound. I really 
was  not.
 
We stayed in the hous e pretty muc h. I played with 
the
 
little gir l. We were very, ver y m uc h to 
our s elves .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  She was appr oxim ately your  age.
 
> > Jos ie Tr aum:  She was my age, yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But you were kept indoors dur ing that time.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us a little bit about what
 
--
 
as you r ec all, you're in their hous e, living ther e with 
them for quite a peri
od of tim e.What was  the impac t on you, as bes t you can tell? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  They saved my life. They r isked their lives . Whatever they did for
 
m e was  wonder ful 
but I really never  felt par t of the fam ily unit. And maybe that's m y own per c eption. But I us ed to 

r em em ber them hugging, the thr ee of them, and I was n't
 
--
 
I'm s orr y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think ever ybody thinks that's perfectly under s tandable, Jos ie.
 
 
You had told m e, too, that when you were in
 
the c onvent, even there your needs  were being 
m et, they were taking c ar e of you, but they were ver y s tr ict but not in the leas t bit dem ons tr ative.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  No.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So quite a period of your  formative years  it was  abs ent affec tion and 
things  like that. 
But why I'm bringing it up is  you told m e befor e that you had had that
 
--
 
you knew you had had that s o 
m uc h from your  m other and your  gr andpar ents , that foundation. Can you s ay a little bit about that?
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Sur e. I feel it's  c
r uc ial for  a c hild for the fir st thr ee year s  of life to have a strong bond 
with a c aretaker, not neces s ar ily a parent but s omeone who takes c ar e of the c hild and the child k nows  

that there's always  s om eone ther e. And I feel I r eally had that with m y m om and with my gr andm other. 
It was  a lot of affec tion, hugging, kis s ing, nurturing. So after that, when I didn't have that, I m is s ed it 
terr ibly.
 
 
The nuns , you know, they tr eated all the c hildr en the s ame way. They weren't us ed to a little 
one, hugging them, holding them . So I think I really, r eally mis s ed that very, ver y m uc h. But I think par t 

of my s tr ength c ame fr om  the fac t that I had it for the first three years  of life. I had a ver y s trong bond 
with m y m om and with my grandm other.
 
But that als o m ade it har d being with the Debr ackalaers  
b
ec aus e they were a unit and I was n't r eally part of it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And 
you 
would remain, of c our s e, living with the Debr ackalaer s  until the war ended in 
Belgium  in 1944. When it ended, your  Aunt Theres a, one of your m
other's s is ters, was  able to find you 
and bring you to her home. Do you know how that happened
 
an
d what that time was  like for you
? The 
war is  over  in Belgium but the war  is  continuing els ewhere in Eur ope for  alm os t another  year.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Yes . Of c
our s e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  that like for you when your aunt br ought you
 
--
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Fir st of all, my mom  had two s is ters , my two aunts . They were hidden thr ough the 
underground in c hurc hes. They ac tually were s aved and were s afe. And bec aus e they wer e part of the 
underground, after the war  they wer e able to find m e. There was  this  whole network of the 
underground. So m y two aunts, my one aunt s pecific ally, Theres a, found m e with the fam ily wher e I 
had been hidden and s he c am e to pick m e up. So
 
I s tayed with her. She had thr ee boys , thr ee s ons , 
three brother s, a few year s  older than me, and, of c our s e, s he took  me in. I s tayed ther e with her . It was  
wonder ful being with family. They r eally
 
--
 
they s poiled m e rotten, whic h was  great. It was  jus t 
wonder ful. I was  like the boys ' little m ascot. They kind of tagged m e along ever y where.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were 5 at that point.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  5, 5 year s  old. But it was  wonderful being with family.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did you know you were J ewis h at that point?
 

7 
 
> > Jos ie Tr aum:  You know, I didn't until I c ame bac k  with m y aunt. I was  so young when I was  put in 
hiding. I was  3 year s old. I r eally didn't even know what a J ew was . So it was n't until I was  reunited with 
m y aunt that I began to see s ome of the traditions and s ome of the things that they were doing in their  
hom e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And both your aunts s ur vived.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How wer e they able to res ume their  lives
? 
Still a war is  going on in Eur ope. How wer e 
they able to
 
feed you and take c are of you and their other c hildr en?
 
> > Jos ie Tr aum:  Fir st of all, they worked. They wer e able and m anaged to get food so that I would be 
able to be fed jus t like them .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In what m us t have just s eem ed like a m irac ulous event, your mother , Fanny, s ur vived 
Aus c hwitz, retur ned to Br us s els after  her  liber ation, April
 
1945, and was  reunited with you and your 
s is ter s. You'r e 6 years old at this  tim e. You hadn't s een your mother for over thr ee year s .What do you 

r em em ber of your
 
m other  r etur ning and what that was  like for you and everybody els e? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  You know, the things I r emem ber ar e many things  that my mom  filled me in with 

bec aus e at that age, you know, I don't r em ember  a lot of the things . But my m om does  fill me in. She's  
kind of filled in the gaps . It was  obvious ly jus t wonderful s eeing her again.
 
 
You know, my m om was  retur ned when s he was  liber ated by the Russ ians . She was  taken by 
the Red Cr os s and taken c ar e of. And eventually s he was  br ought back  to Brus s els . And, of c our s e, the 

fir s t plac e s he went was  her  s ister's  hous e. She k noc ked on the door and ther e I was . So we wer e 
r eunited.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And to that point s he had no idea.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  No. She didn't know I was  ther e. She didn't know where I
 
was . She r eally didn't know 
anything. She jus t wanted to the hous e. Tr uly
 
--
 
I was  ther e. So that was  abs olutely wonderful.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your mother s uffer ed horrific ally. Can you jus t tell us a little bit about what happened to 

her ? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum
: 
 
Well, when s he was  liber ated 
--
 
fir s t of all s he was  in Ausc hwitz. You know, mos t 
c onc entration c am ps wer e killing c enter s. You got ther e and they killed you. Aus c hwitz had a 

s ub
-
c am p, a labor c amp, Birkenau. 
 
 
By the way, s he got there, s he was  deported with her par ents  and her parents  did not make it. 
My gr andfather died on one of the tr ains . You know, people, the pr is oner s , were s tuck  in a c attle c ar , 
150 pris oners . By the time they got to the c onc entr ation c amp fr om the c ountry they c am e from, they 
wou
ld be s tuck  on this cattle c ar  without food or water and by the tim e they got to the c am p, 40 or s o 
people wer e alr eady dead. My gr andfather died on one of the trains. 
 
 
And when they got off the tr ain, ther e was  a s election. Bec aus e there was  a factory th
er e, they 
would tr y to get the pr is oner s  who were young enough on one s ide and they would go to work in the 
fac tor y. And the people who wer e elderly or  handic apped or if they were holding c hildr en, they would be 
put on the other  s ide. And m y m om and her mother  wer e s epar ated imm ediately. They thought m y 

grandm other was  an elderly per s on. She was  in her  50s. So they wer e s epar ated imm ediately. And m y 
m other  actually wanted to be in the line with her mother  and a Germ an actually hit her  and s aid, ﬁ Y
ou 
go wher
e you'r e told.
ﬂ 
She ac tually never  s aw her  m other  again.
 
 
So my mother actually s ur vived
 
--
 
s he was  in the fac tor y in Birkenau filling
 
--
 
they wer e m aking 
am m unition, filling grenades  and bombs. My mother  wor ked ther e every s ingle day. So when s he was  

libe
r ated
 
--
 
s he actually was on a Death Mar c h. The Nazis  r ealized that the allies  wer e appr oac hing s o 
they wer e taking som e of the pr is oners  out and making them m arc h towards  Germ any. And they would 
march
 
--
 
actually, my mother m arc hed on the Death Marc h. They c alled it a Death Marc h bec aus e s o 
m any people died on this marc h. My mother was  on the Death Mar c h fr om J anuar y
 
1945 till A pril
 
1945. 
She was  ac tually liberated by the Rus s ians. She was  in one of the last battles  on the river  between the 
Rus s ians  and th
e Germans . She was  ac tually liber ated there. She weighed about 65
 
pounds. She had 
m eningitis and Typhus . And she was  a pr etty s ic k  per s on. So the Red Cros s  actually took  c ar e of her 
for a while and then brought her down, back  to Brus s els . And that's how we
 
were reunited.

> > Bill Bens on:  And c ons idering all that s he had been through and now s he's  reuniting with you, what 
was  life like in thos e months  after the war  when you were back reunited
? 
Was s he able to tr y to res ume 
s om e s ens e of being able to s upport
 
you
? 
What happened then? 
 
> > Jos ie Tr aum:  Well, she did get s ome s uppor t from her s ister s.We ac tually
 
--
 
we went back  to 
live
 
--
 
after living with m y  aunt for  a while, we went to live in our old apartment. We lived there actually 
until m y dad c ame back.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Let's  turn to that. The following s pr ing, I think 1946, your  father, J acques , r etur ns, 

m akes it back . What happened to him and how did he get back ?
 
> > Jos ie Tr aum:  My dad c ouldn't c om e back
 
--
 
war  ended in 1945. He c ouldn't c om e back imm ediately 
bec aus e the hous e he had been living in London was  bombed and he s pent two years  in a hos pital. He 
was  injur ed pr etty badly. So he c ame back in 1946. I actually met him when I was  7 years  old.
 

> > Bill B
ens on:  Do you remember  that?
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Umm , I do. My m om and I went to the port c ity wher e his  boat c ame in. This m an 

c am e walking down the s teps . My mom s aid, "There's your father." I had no idea who he was  bec aus e 
he left when I was  13 m onths  old. So I really did not remem ber him. And it was  pretty har d, you know, 
for m y mom and dad and m e to kind of bec om e a family again.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know at what point your mom lear ned that he was  alive before he got back?
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  At the end 
of the war  when s he c ame back  to Belgium, s he was  able to c orr es pond 
with him. All of thes e years  while s he was  in c oncentration c amp, s he r eally didn't know what had 
happened to him nor did he know what happened to her .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So onc e you're all
 
back  together , you'r e 7 year s old.What happened to you from an 
ac ademic  standpoint
? 
You s tar ted s c hool.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  I s tarted s c hool. I really hadn't m is s ed m uc h s c hool becaus e I was  too young to 
attend s c hool befor e. So onc e Belgium  was  liberated, when I was  5 years  old, I went back  to s c hool. 
But up till then I r eally hadn't mis s ed anything becaus e really I was  too young.
 
 
My par ents , onc e my dad c ame back , my parents  dec ided they really wanted to leave Europe. 
So they applied for  per mis sion vis as  to be able to c ome to the United States . They applied. And in 1949 
we ac tually did c ome to the United States and s ettled in New J er s ey.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Why did it take three years ? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Ther e were quotas .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Quotas .
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Ther e were quotas . We had to wait. We filled out m any, many paper s. It took  a while 

for it to becom e available.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During that thr ee
-
year  period that you were all together in Belgium, befor e you c ame to 
the U.S., was  your  father able to res ume his  wor k ?
 

> > J os ie Tr aum:  He did. We lived in an apar tm ent building whic h ac tually was  m y par ents' building. It 
had four stor ies.While we wer e hiding, by the way, during the war , we lived in the attic  apartment. So 
onc e m y dad c ame back
 
--
 
the bottom, the ground floor, was  ac tually a store, a tailor ing s hop. And m y 
dad us ed to have bolts of m aterial bec aus e in thos e days  you c ouldn't jus t go to a stor e and buy a 
r eady
-
m ade s uit. So m y dad had bolts  of material and c ustom er s would c om e in who wanted
 
a s uit. 
They would pic k out their m ater ial. My dad would meas ure them, m ake a patter n. It would take weeks 

and weeks  to make a s uit. Bec aus e you'd c om e for differ ent fittings. You'd m ake a patter n out of paper . 
Then you get the m ater ials . So you kind of had a relationship with your  c ustomer s . So m y father r an the 
s hop. It was  his . He did wor k. And we lived in bac k  of the s hop.We had an apartment.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And then, of c ours e, the quota num bers cam e up. You wer e able to make it. You c am e 
to the U.S
. in 1949. You were 10. What was  it like for you and for your parents  in light of all that you 
had been thr ough, to c om e her e and s tart new life?
 

> > J os ie Tr aum:  It 
had 
m any c hallenges. I m ust s ay it was  ver y diffic ult. My dad s poke Englis h 
bec aus e he was
 
in England but my m om and I, of c our s e, did not. We lived
 
--
 
m y m om  had an elderly 
aunt living in Patter son, New J er s ey. We lived with her for about a m onth till m y parents found work  and 

our  own apar tm ent. My dad worked in the garment dis tr ic t in New York and would c omm ute daily fr om  

9 
 
New J er s ey to New York . And m y mom worked in different dr essmaking shops . It was  hard
 g
etting 
bac k  together.
 
Though my m other, I think it was  probably the most diffic ult. She tr ied to talk  to s om e 
family that we had and people didn't want to hear her. They r eally s aid, you k now, this  is all in the pas t. 
It was  bad.We don't want to talk  about it. And s o s he really had no one to talk  to. So it must have been 
extremely diffic ult for her.
 
 
Me, when I came, I was 10 year s  old. It was  ac tually two months before my 10th bir thday. 
They put m e in fir st gr ade bec aus e they figur ed if you don't s peak  Englis h, you know, you don't know 

anything. So I was  put in first gr ade.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At 10 year s  old.
 
> > Jos ie Tr aum:  At 10 year s  old.
 
I was  ther e for two weeks . Then they put me in s ec ond gr ade. I was 
ther e for  another two weeks, and then thir d gr ade. And eventually I graduated from  elementar y s c hool 
at the r egular age. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And apar t from even that, you s hared with me that
 
when you first arr ived at that school, 
alm os t right away you wer e beaten up by a gang of gir ls. 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Yes . [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  mother  went down to see the princ ipal.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  The pr inc ipal.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  hi
s  r eac tion? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  You'r e right. My firs t day in sc hool I had a gang of gir ls  waiting outs ide for me and I 

was  beaten up pretty badly. I didn't know why. I hadn't even s aid a wor d to them . I c ouldn't. So m y m om 
m ar c hed down to the princ ipal the next day and wanted to know what had happened. And the princ ipal 
s aid, well, the gir ls thought that you wer e German. I c an't im agine that they would beat me up for that or  
that they would even think  I was  Germ an. But it never  happened again. And I didn't l
ear n 
how to
 
fight 
bac k .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you acc eler ated ver y quickly, c am e to the r ight age and right s c hool level.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  I did. Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J os ie, how many members  of your  extended fam ily did you los e dur ing the Holoc aus t? 
 
>> 
J os ie Traum:  Well, I would s ay about 12 people, immediate fam ily.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Imm ediate family.
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Yes .

--
 
first of all, fr
om  m y m om telling me what had happened to her 
par ents to my father's
 
--
 
one of his  br others , his  whole fam ily. You know, little by little I started r ealiz ing 
and lear ning what had happened.
 
 
As  a teenager, when I got older, I star ted r eading. Bec aus e I r ea
lly c ouldn't get muc h 
inform ation fr om m y m om . I didn't want to ask  her  a lot bec aus e I knew it would hurt her. So I did a lot 

of reading. I found out a lot of his tory and what had happened.

on Decem ber

will you

> > J os ie Tr aum:  I knew would as k  m e that.
 
 
My m other tells  me this  bec aus e I don't r emember.When s he c ame back  and when we were 
r eunited, I would tie my night gown to her bec ause I was  afr aid to los e her. I gues s I was  afraid s he 

would go away again. But I don't remember that. And thes e ar e the things m y m other tells  m e.

In addition to your  mother , Fanny, your  hus band Fr eddie is  also a Holoc aus t s ur vivor.

like for you to do this, to be able to s peak  and to know that you have a m other who is  s till able to d
o it 
and a hus band, too? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  Sur e. Well, I think  it's  s o im portant for today, for the generations , the younger  
generation even, to under s tand and to k now what happened. I go to a lot of m iddle s c hools and high 
s c hools  to s peak . It really gr atifies  me to see that young people ar e interested, that they ar e studying 

about the Holoc aust and that they r eally ar e learning a lot. So that is s o impor tant to m e. And for me it's 
important to be active her e, for  Fr eddie to be ac tive here, and m y m om, it's im portant for her.

For  thos e of you, if you want to have a question, either go to the m ic , probably the bes t thing,

Yes, sir ?

people to r es pond.When you s ee things being done to other people, people being hur t, or anyone 
being mis treated, I r eally  s tr ongly believe that you have to s peak up. How one per s on c an m ake a 

differ enc e. And I think  it is  s o c ruc ial for people to be able to s peak  up and defend s om eone and s ay 
s top it, you c an't do this
. 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you. I'm  glad you had the c hanc e to meet Freddie and J os ie in another s etting. 

That's wonderful.
 
 
We have another  ques tion. Yes, ma'am ? 
 
> > [Ques tion Inaudible]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Have you been able to forgive the Ger m ans
? 
And what has  the healing pr oc es s  been 
like for you over  the year s ? 
 
> > J os ie Tr aum:  I s ee. I don't think I c an forgive but I don't hold the new gener ation and the younger 
people r es pons ible for  their
 
--
 
for what their par ents  and gr andparents  did. So I think in a way that, for  
m e is a bit of a healing proc es s. Es pec ially her e in the mus eum, we get young people from Austr ia and 
Germ any who volunteer. Instead of going to the Ar my in their  c ountr y, they c ome and volunteer here 
and s tay for two year s . So to me, in a way that's been healing bec aus e I c an s ee
 
--
 
I c an bec om e 
fr iendly and c los e to people as  long as they had nothing to do with the Holoc aus t. It's  diffic ult for me to 

r elate to s omebody maybe my age or older bec aus e I think  to mys elf what were they doing at that time. 

But the younger  people I c an't hold them  r es pons ible. And I feel very differently to them.
 
 
I don't know if that answers it.

Belgium is  a ver y s mall c ountry, the size of Delawar e, 
population eight million. 66,000 of thos e wer e J ews . As  soon as the Germans  c am e in, 28,000 Jews  

were hidden by Chr is tian people. So you know, I s ee how much people did s ac rific e. They helped 
tr em endous ly. But that does n't m ean everybody helped. My m other  was  denounc ed by our neighbor . 
Bec aus e s om e of the Chr is tian people would get money if they told the Ger mans where the J ews  wer e. 

But I think  for tunately in Belgium there were many more people who helped and really r is ked their liv
es .

> > J os ie Tr aum:  Fir st of all, thank  you, all of you, for being her e.When I speak  to young people, I 
us ually like to r ead a s aying that is  wr itten ac tually her e in the m us eum, on the s ec ond floor, as you 
exit. There's  a s aying on the wall whic h, to me, is  s o important. It was  s aid by a luge reas on minister , 

Martin 
Niem oller
. And this  is  what he s aid.

Firs t they c ame for the soc

s
. I did not s peak  out bec aus e I was  not a tr ade unionis t. Then they c ame for  
the J ews . I did not s peak  out bec aus e I was  not a J ew. Then they c am e for me. And
 
ther e was  no one 
left to s peak for m e.

To m e, this  is  s o im por tant. You've got to s peak  out for your  fellow hum an beings . It does  
m ake a differenc e. And this  is  an ans wer  to you. What do I think is  the m os t important thing
? 
I think  it is 
important for p
eople to be able to s peak  out.
 
 
By the way, this  m inis ter , this  Lutheran minis ter at the beginning of the war , he was  very muc h 
pr o Hitler bec ause Hitler pr om is ed s o many wonderful things . When he s aw what Hitler was  doing, he 

was  very m uc h against him . He
 
was  ac tually im pr is oned. 
 
 
However, when you go thr ough the m us eum

ac tually, the end of the s ec ond floor, this  is 
wr itten on the wall. J us t take a mom ent and read it for yourselves . I think it's  s o important.
