MICHAEL W. WOLFF 
Octo ber 17, 2010
 
 
Question: This is the United States Holocaus
t Memorial Museum interview with Michael 
Wolff, conducted by Julia Danilina on Octobe
r 17th of 2010 at 
the Kindertransport 
Association conference in Ar
lington, Virginia. First of a
ll, I would like to -- you to 
introduce yourself. Tell me your first and la
st name, where you were born and wh en.   

Answer: My name is Michael Wolff. I was bor
n in Breslau, Germany on Ju ne 29th, 1936. 
Q: First of all, let me thank you for taking 
the time to conduct this 
interview with us, and 
I would like to return to your early years an
d I would like to ask you about your fami ly 
and ab out your to wn . Was it small, big,
 how many brothers and sisters you had? 
A: Okay. I was born in Breslau to -- to Arno ld and Elsa Wolff, who lived in Reichenbach, 

where my father had an interest in a sawmil
l. I was very young when I left Germany. I 
don't have any recollection of 
the size of the town . The reason I was born in Breslau is 
that my father did not like the 
clinic in Reichenbach so he se
nt my mother to Breslau, but 
we actually lived in Reichenbach. As far as th
e town, I have no memories at all because I 
was just -- I left just b e
fore my third birthday. 
Q: I see. Did you have -- and do y
ou have any brothe
rs and sisters?  
A: I don't have brothers and sisters. I'm an
 only child. As a matter of fact, when my 
mother told her father that she was pregnant
 he was very annoyed with her. His comment 
was that you don't bring a Jewish child into
 the wo rld under the 
present conditions in 
Germany. 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      4 
Q: So both of your parent
s were Jewish or just -- 
A: Both of my parents were Jewish. My fath
er was born into an or
thodox family. He was 
the youngest of six, of Doctor Wilhelm (ph) 
Wolff and Hermenia (ph)
 Wolff. My mother  
was -- was the youngest of two.
 She was born into the Fran
tz and Martha 
David family 
in -- in Guben.  
Q: What was their occupations by the time -- 
A: My father -- my mother wo
rked in -- in my grandfathe
r 's store when 
she was young. 
Her mother died when -- when she was only 13, and -- no, 
I 'm sorry, 17, and she -- so she 
work ed in  the store helping my  grandfather. 
He had a general -- a small general store, 

toys and, you know, home goods and that ki
nd of thing. My father was set up by my  
grandfather with a half interest in a sawmill
 in Reichenbach. He was the youngest, like I 
said, and the rest of them, the older kids we
nt to college, but by th e time my  father was 
ready to go my  grandfather 
was getting old so he just bought a business interest, half 
interest in t h e business. 
Q: Would you describe your fa
mily as well off or middle class or, do you rememb er that? 
A: I would -- I don't rememb er much, but my
 -- my  feeling is there -- they were 
reasonably well off. I think middl
e class is probably appropriate
. My mother worked as a 
bookkeeper for quite a while 
until she got married, and I know
 she got pregnant pretty 
quick after that.  
Q: Do you reme mb er if your
 parents were religious? 
A: My father was born -- was raised orthod
ox, and he had a problem when one of his 
favorite cousins married out of the religion. 
They sit Shiva for her, and -- which really 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      5 
annoyed him, so he left -- he had nothing to
 do with orthodoxy the 
rest of his life. We 
were not extremely religious, but we -- he al
ways celebrated the holidays. That's  about 
the extent of the -- of their religious ac
tivities for -- for variou
s reasons. Shavuot was 
never a big thing in our house, but the 
Passover was very big always, always had 
Passover, and th ey always attended services 
for Yo m Kippur and Ro sh Hash anah, and we 
did almo st nothing for Hanukkah
, so that was basically it. 
Q: Do you remember that da
y when you were sent off 
as a Kindertransport child? 
A: No, I don't.  

Q: You don't remember that?  
A: No, I don't, but I can tell you the story behind it.   
Q: Sure. 

A: Of course in -- in early 19
39 my  mo ther's best friend sent
 her daughter Eva to be taken 
in by foster parents in Sco
tland, in Glasgow, Scotland, a
nd my mother was unwilling to 
let me go at that time. When 
-- by May she decided it was probably best if I go, so she 
made arrangements for me to be adopted by th
e same family or by -- by a memb er of that 
family in -- in -- also in Gl
asgow, Scotland.So in mid June, 
and I believe it's the 15th of 
June, but I'm not totally certain, she went to  
Berlin with me, and since I was -- I was two 
weeks short of my  third birthday, she was allo
wed to go on th e train to
 -- to the -- to the 
ship. So as a matter of fact 
the story she tells is that they
 had to stop the train because 
a -- the head count was one over. They  had co
unted her as one of the children. So once 
they got it straightened out we 
went to the -- shipboard , and sh
e handed me over to one of 
the older girls, you know, please 
take care of my  child, and th at's how I got onto the ship. 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      6 
There were approximately 180. I don't know 
the name of the ship. Sh e wouldn't -- it was 
very, very difficult for her to
 talk about it. You know, it 
was really hard, and she had 
handed me off on a ship. Sh e 
thinks there were about 180 on
 it, and I was the youngest of 
the -- the group.Wh en  we got to London, Live
rpool station, she had arranged -- with her 
usual thoroughness she had arranged fo r her -- 
one of her girlfriends who lived in London 
to meet me there, and I met this lady mu ch
 later on in life and she told  me that, you 
know, she was the only person 
in the London station speaking
 German, so I grabbed onto  
her and I wouldn't let go. Now, the fami ly th
at adopted  me in Glasgow, Mr. and Mrs. 
Ness, Mr. Ness came  down to
 London in his car and pick ed me up, and she 
actually -- this lady Elsa Weiss (ph), was her 
name, you know, made sure I got with him, 
and we went to Glasgow. 
Q: And what are your first recollections of -- 

A: I remember the house in Gl
asgow. I don't reme mb er anything about the trip, but I do 
remember the house in Glasgow. You know, I 
remember at the end we were at a dead 
end street. At the end of the street there was 
a hill, and across the hill was a railroad track, 

and the trains would always fascinate me  
going by. I remember Mr. Ness very well. I 
don't reme mb er Mrs. Ness, and I don't re
me mb er Anita, their daughter, who was two 
years older than I am, and I do rememb er him 
-- you know, they were
 very orthodox, and 
he was -- he always put on his tefillin in the 
morning prayers, and I 
had my Å’ my building 
blocks, my  wooden building blocks, and I wo
uld tie those on standi
ng next to him and I 
would dove in with him, you know, kind
 of imitating him. That I rememb er. 
Q: Do you -- did you know th
e story, like how you came to England? Did th ey tell you 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      7 
the story? 
A: The -- my -- my -- you kno
w, I pieced it together from 
my father. My father had a 
small  prayer book, and inside that prayer 
book he has -- he took 
notes from this whole 
thing, you know, of wh en he was arrested in
 Christinenth al (ph) and wh ere he was and 
when  he got to England, so a 
lot of this stuff I pieced ba
ck  from, you know, taking -- you 
know, trying to get stuff out of my mother a
nd from his notes in his prayer book, which I 
still have. 

Q: Oh, so your parents e
nded up also in England? 
A: Not really, but let me go through with that. 
Q: Sure.  
A: Okay. According to my fath
er's records, he came to -- he
 came to England in August 
of '39.  My mo ther -- back in Germany sh
e was, you know, taking care of her father, 
who lived  with her. Sh e was -- took over the -- 
charge of the sawmill because the partner 
was also arrested. My father wa
s arrested. The partner was arrest
ed in Christinenthal (ph).  
They  were sent to Doha (ph
), and my mother had all this responsib ility, so -- plus she was 
trying to  get him out of there, and if yo
u had a visa to get out to an ywhere you 
could -- they would let you ou
t, and, you know, a little mone
y also under the table also 
helped. So in Au gust of 1939 
he came over to England, but he was not allowed to  land in  
England per se. They kept him in what th
ey called concentration camps at the time, 
which were actually work camps
. He was on the Isle of Man,
 and then he was on several 
other ones during his stay. They  kept moving 
him around. He -- he came to see me, and 
this is what I get from his notes. He came to 
see me, and of course I wouldn't -- I didn't 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      8 
recognize him, and I denied that he was my 
father. He was trying to tell me he was my 
father. He came to visit me several times in 
Scotland. While this was going on my  mo ther 
was applying fo r visas worldwide, anywhere 
that she could go, and the only place that 
would take her, the only visa she was able to
 get was in Bolivia, South America. So in 
early 1940 she left fo
r Bolivia. Somehow th ey managed to keep in  touch with  each other 
constantly, and my  father asked th at she 
go through Italy and not through Holland 
because a lot of the ships out 
of Holland were being torped
oed. Well, she went through 
Holland, and not -- and not out of Italy, and ir
ony would have it the ship out of Italy was 
sunk and the ship she was on, 
she made it to Bolivia. As soon
 as she got to Bolivia, she 
went to work for a Jewish la
wyer, who happened  to be the 
partner of a Bolivian senator, 
Dr. Bachnorsodo (ph), and through his help sh e 
got visas for my father and I to come and 
join her in Bolivia. We had -- Mr. Ness drov
e us down to  Liverp
ool, and we had three 
hiccups so to  speak. We got to
 Liverpool the first time an d 
my father was late because 
they didn't release him on time, so we had 
to  go back. We missed the boat. The second 
time they arrested my father because his papers were out
 of date, so we had to  go back, 
and he was in jail, and then th
ey finally got it straightened ou t. On the third time -- excuse 
me -- in late 1940, I think it was Decemb er 23r
d, around there, we finally sailed for -- for 
South America. I remember very little about th
e crossing. I remember that I heard cannon 
fires, and I heard -- you know, we were on 
emergencies. I don't know if it was a drill or 
actually a boat sighting, but we -- we came
 through, and I reme
mber a little bit of 
Bermuda. There was -- I remember
 very vividly there was a big ship model in -- in a 
window that I really wanted. 
You know, I was spoiled. I had 
a lot of toys in England, 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      9 
and, you know, my  father, you 
know, he had basically two co
ins to rub together in his 
pocket, and it was -- there was a big tantrum. 
We went through the Panama Canal, went 
through -- you know, came down to Chile and 
to Bolivia, and I met 
this woman at the 
station in La Paz. You know, my  mo ther hadn
't seen me for a year and-a-half, and of 
course I didn't know her. You know, it was a 
strange woman. We -- we were very poor. 
When my father had the sawmill
 back in Germany, he built 
a series of about 12 or 13 
boxes in which they put all their -- their 
goods in, big wooden boxes, and we went -- we 
managed to get one of them to Bolivia, and 
it happened  to  be linen s and bedding, and she 
kept selling the linens and beddin
g to keep us going. My father
 finally found a job, which 
was out of town, in a sawmill, run by a 
fellow Jew. My mother was working for 
this -- Doctor Breeker (ph) was his name, you 
know, as a -- as a secretary or something 
like that, so I was in -- I was in day school, 
and so metimes I would stay with the Breekers 
(ph) in the evening. I can rememb er very 
little about the day school,
 but I do remember 
that for lunch every day we had this fruit com
pote, and even at that age I would pick the 
raisins out of the compote because I never lik
ed them, so just that
's  what I remember. 
Eventually my father got job 
with a -- in a mining
 town, Poto si, which is very high up in  
the Andes, about 12, 14,000 fe
et up in  the Andes, and so we moved to Po tosi, and we 
stayed with -- the first place we stayed 
was with my mother's
 girlfriend from -- my 
mo ther's gramma r school girlfriend. Her name 
was Erma (ph) Freed (ph), and they had an 
apartment. They let us stay 
there -- they had an extra bedr
oom -- until we got settled. Her 
and I were just -- you know, Erma was the tota
l opposite of my  mo ther. My mo ther was a 

very, very  serious person, you 
know, very straight, and Erma
 was a total cutup, and we 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      10 
would, you know, call each othe
r names and pick at each other, and you know, do tricks 
to each other constantly, and we did this -- as 
long as she was alive we did this. And then 
we moved into a -- our own apartment, which is kind of an interesting ap artment. We had 
a bedroom, a dining room and a kitchen, a ve
ry large kitchen, and the bathroom was -- I 
always tell this to my grandkids because th
ey don't believe me, but the bathroom was 
across the patio, and it was shared by -- by th
ree or four ap artments. It did not have 
running water. It did not have an y lights, so 
I always traipsed across the patio with my 
bucket to flush, my little board to sit on 
and toilet paper, a candle and matches. You 
know, it was a big trick. We -- like I say, th
ere was -- the only running water we had was 
in the kitchen, and we would take a bath once
 a week, you know, in a big tub just like the 
farmers used to do, and you 
know, the water had to be boi
led and th e water had to  be 
filtered because it came to town  in open channels. It was pr
etty primitive. And I went to 
school, and I went to grammar school, and of  course I stood out like a sore thumb. There 
was about three or four of us gringos in the 
school, and the first -- my first year there I 
got -- during one recess I got tripped up and broke my  arm, so my  parents didn't want me 
there. So they moved me to a 
Catholic school, which was really -- really across the street 
from our house, and I wasn't tr
eated very well there. They -- 
you know, they  -- they didn't 
like Jews, you know. They made me
 go to services. I got to kneel. I got to cross my self. I 
probably knew more 
about the Catholism than I did ab
out the Jewish religion, but I 
survived. Later on my father 
became a manager up in the mine, up in his section of the 
mine, and they gave us comp an
y housing, so we moved out to
 -- to a place called Chaco, 
which was outside of town , and it was kind of
 far out. While I was in town we -- I was 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      11 
going to  Hebrew school once a 
week to learn a few -- a few things, but once we were out 
of town  that was impossible because we didn't
 have a car, but it was a nice home. We had 
a really nice house, you know, compared 
to what we had befo re, and I went to 
the -- the -- to the school, the 
comp any school, which had, I 
think, eight kids total, you 
know, from all -- from first grade through -- th
rough sixth, seventh -- sixth grade, so we 
were in a company school. I st
arted learning English again, wh
ich I had totally forgotten. 
My mother always kidded me
. She says when I first got 
to Bolivia I spoke Spanish, 
English and German in one sentence until I --
 you know, I lost the English and then 
picked up Spanish and the Ge
rman. So I went to school there until the sixth grade,  
and then  they sent me out of town to scho
ol in Aurora, which is
 a town approximately 
400 miles away, and I was at boarding school 
-- I was in board ing school and went to an 
American school there.  It was an Angelo
-American school, which mainly teaches from  
the states, retired teachers from th e states, 
spinsters mainly, and I was bar mitzv ahed 
there in town, and I -- I learned my Hebrew 
for, you know, a month -- two months befo re, 
and I forgot it two mo nths afterwards, but 
it was -- it was interestin g, the school. My 
mo ther believed that -- you know, in German
y you wear short pants, so I had to wear 
short pants. So my first year there I'm -- 
I 'm taller than most kids, and I was -- I was 
wearing short pants, and th at was -- that was te
rrible. That was just a really bad year. The 
second year I grew into long pa
nts, and, you know, I was one
 of the older kids so we 
were pulling the tricks that had been pulled on
 me on the younger kids, so that was a little 
bit better. You know, as soon as we got to Bo liv
ia my  -- my  parents applied for a visa to 
come to the United States, and my father 
was actually Polish quota. He was born in 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      12 
Germany, but it became Poland after World War 
I, so they considered
 him Polish quota, 
so we applied right away. Now, the whole tim
e we were in Bolivia my parents and the 
Ness family were corr
esponding with each other. They  
kept in touch. You know, my  
parents kept -- you know, I don't know -- th
rough the Elfbaugh 
(ph), which was the 
publication for the German Jews basically, th ey
 kept -- I think it came out of New York.  
I'm pretty sure it was. They  kept -- you kno
w, you could put ads in th ere, you know, 
Arnold and Elsa Wolff from Re
ichenbach, Germany looking fo
r their family and friends, 
and they -- they got in contac
t with all my -- all my uncles 
on my  father's side and my  
aunt, and they -- they got in 
touch with a lot of their fri
ends. So th ey -- they kept 
in -- they were big writers. They always wrote 
letters and always kept in touch, and th ey 
still corresponded with the Ness 
family so -- while this was 
going on. In March of '52 we 
finally got okay to come, so we left Potosi 
and we went through Or
uro to  La Paz, which 
was a beautiful city, and then ev
entually to Arica, where weboarded the ship
 to come to 
the states. We came up the West Coast of So
uth America to the Panama Canal, and the 
first thing I saw -- actu ally Panama City was in United States territo ry. I saw first an 
African-American speaking Englis
h, which just totally blew 
me away because
 in Bolivia, 
you know, the Mestizos and th
e Indians only spoke Ketroami
na (ph). They didn't even 
speak Spanish, so that was a re
al surprise to me, and we flew
 to New Orleans and then to 
Memphis, Tennessee, where my
 mo ther had a cousin, and th
ey -- they actu
ally vouched 
for us, and that's how we got 
in. I went to high school there.
 Well, they put me back a 
year because we got here in March. The -- th
e school year here was almost over, so they 
put me back a grade, and th ey -- so I had to
 struggle with that. 
I remember Mrs. Mosey 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      13 
(ph) at Central High School flunked me in 
English because during th e test I had to ask 
her what some words meant, and she wouldn'
t tell me, and,youkn
ow, I had only been 
here two weeks, and I didn't  know all the En
glish language and she wouldn't help me so 
she flunked me. I joined an
 AZA group, you know, the AZA group, leg of the B'nai 
B'rith, and I met a lot of kids and a lot of
 friends. My father was having a hard time 
with -- with the heat in Memphis. He had 
arthritis and it was bothe
ring him a lot, and, 
you know, jobs were hard to get, so my  mo th
er had another cousin  in San Francisco, and 
my  father decided he was going to  go to 
San Francisco, so he went ahead of us. 
Sometime, I believe, in March or April of '
53, went to San Francisco, found a job and 
found -- found a place for us to stay with a 
Jewish -- a boarding -- like a board  house type 
of thing. So in June -- as soon as school wa
s out in June of '53 my  mother and I followed 
him. We -- you know, we railroaded across th
e country into San Francisco, and there I 
again joined another a see AZ
A chapter. Some of those -- so
me of my friends from the 
AZA chapter I'm still in touc
h with today, and that was 
a good experience for me. That 
was really very interesting for me, and I went to
 high school there, and all this time -- oh, 
actually I forgot -- I forgot to mention that 
while we were in Memphis Mr. and Mrs. Ness 
were coming to New Yo rk, and they wanted  
my  parents to -- to meet -- you know, bring 
me up there so they could see me, and my  pare
nts had just arrived in the country. They 
both had new jobs, and we really didn't have a
ny money to -- to -- to spend on a trip. So 
my parents, you know, were denied -- refuse
d them, and they were very angry. They  
had -- you know, they really wa
nted to see me. As irony woul
d have it Mr. Ness got very  
sick and they never made it to New York, so
 they didn't actually
 come to New York . 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      14 
So while we were in San Francisco, like I said
, I went to high school there and graduated 
from George Washington High Sc
hool, and I went to city co
llege for a couple years and 
eventually went to -- to Berkel
ey , where I got my  BS degree in engineering, and I met my  
wife at Berkeley, and then I got -- we got marr
ied, and I had -- I went to work for Pacific 
Gas Electric Company in Pittsburgh, California. 
I lived in Concord, 
worked in Pittsburgh, 
and then  I got drafted. What 
had happened  is, I went to 
work for Pacific Gas Electric 
because of getting deferments 
fro m the Army and as soon as 
I got there they cu t out the 
deferments so I got drafted. So I went to 
Fort Ord for, you know, 
three months for basic 
training, and then on the way to  -- to Dugway
, Utah, where I was going to be stationed, I 
picked up my wife in San 
Fran cisco and we went on, 
and it was -- it was kind of 
interesting. We got to this -- you know, we
 got to Salt Lake City on a Sunday mo rning, 
didn't  know a sole, you know, fo und a sold ie
r, and he was going up to  Du gway, and so 
we got on here and we -- we drive out of Sa
lt Lake City, and we drive for miles and miles 
and finally come to a little 
town, and all we could see 
was a snowbank because it had 
snowed for a while, and he said this is wh
ere you're going to live because there is no 
house on the post, and then we
 drive for another hour and we
 come to this gate in the 
middle of the desert, and, you 
know, what is this. We finally
 got to the main post, and 
sure enough I -- we couldn't  get -- we c
ouldn't get any on post housing, and we ended up 
in a little dinky basement apartment in town
, and I had -- I had to commute back and 
forth, usually on the bus, and 
you had to get up at five in 
the mo rning and walk over to 
the bus. It was always icy and slippery. So 
half the time I was on my -- sitting on my butt 
trying to  get to the bus, and we went there, 
and we stayed there for a couple years. My 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      15 
son -- my  oldest -- my  son was born there on 
June 13th , 1960. He was born th ere, and it 
was -- you know, we managed to make it through
. I finally got out of the Army  in '62, 
early '62. They extended us b
ecause they had a problem in Be
rlin, and we settled in -- in 
Orange County, California, an
d my  -- my  daughter was born th ere, and even tu ally I  
got -- I got tired of Orange County. You know
, it's just too crowded, too many people. 
I'm very impatient. I don't like to wait. Ever
y time you went to a restaurant you had to 
wait in line. Every time you went to a show y
ou had to wait in line, so I started looking 
around and I found a job in Sant
a Barbara. So in -- in May of
 1970 I went up to Santa 
Barbara and stayed in a privat
e home, just rented a bedroo
m and stayed there for -- for 
three or four months until we found a house, and eventually my wife and the kids came 
up and we settled in Santa Barbara. All th
is time I was still 
corresponding with the 
Nesses, but the -- you know, my  parents had 
stopped because they were mad at them.  
The Nesses were mad at my  parents, and my  
-- you know, I eventually
 lost contact with 
them. They -- you know, letters didn't -- we
ren't -- there was no response to me, so 

in -- you know, the next thing th at happened
, my  parents moved down  to Orange County 
to -- to -- you know, to leisure world, and so 
they were close. We always visited them. 
We always had Passover with them, but, you kn
ow, they lived a little b
it away so we only 
saw them three or four times a year maybe. An
d fast forward to 1992.
 I have a bunch of 
people -- a bunch of friends that we go to
 lunch with. We go to  lunch almo st every 
day -- every weekday, and we'v e been doing this
 since 1971. So  on th
is day in 1992 one 
of the guys was -- who happened  to  be my  den
tist, came to lunch, and he was one of our 
regulars, and he brought another fellow, 
Bob, who I also know, and Bob makes the 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      16 
statement that he was so happy. They had 
a big bar mitzvah, or
thodox Jews, and the 
Moschoas (ph) finally went back  to Scotland.
 They  got out of his house and out of their 
hair, and I asked him, I said, where in Scotla
nd, and he says Glasgow, and I said, well, 
you know, next time your wife ta
lks to her relatives have them find out wh at happened to  
the Ness girl. This is Anita Ness, the da
ughter of the couple that adopted  me, and 
she -- he said okay, well, I'll 
do it, and I forgot about it. Three, four days later I get a 
phone call. He says I got a phone number fo r yo
u, and this is Sunday night about 6:00, so 
obviously I can't call. You know, 5:00 Mo
nday morning the phone rings. It 's  Anita, 
where have you been ? Why haven't you called me? I said, I didn't  know your name. You 
got married. I didn't know your married name
. So we started corresponding, and in 
mid -- in the summer of '92 my  wife and I went
 over there. She insi
sted that -- you know, 
that we stay with her, and she 
wanted to go on th e trip with us
, and I said -- I told Lani, I 
said, well, l et 's -- let 's j u st see how it goes. We
 actually came into 
London. We stayed in 

London for a week, and her so
n, Richard, picked me up, 
picked us up and to ok us to 
dinner at their home, which was very nice. 
They  had two ch ildren. Lauren and Jonath an 
were the two kids, and, you know, we got al
ong fine. Everything wa
s fine, and then we 
finally took the train up to -- up to Scotland, 
and Anita is -- is a st
ran g e bird. She's very 

nervous, I don't know, very sheltered person is
, I guess, the best way to put it. So , you 
know, she met us, but she was real scared to death, maybe we have two head s or we'r e 
weird or something, but ever
ything work ed out fine. We got
 along fine. She got a report 
from her son so she wasn't quite as nervous 
as she should be, but
 she -- she was -- she 
was okay with it, and we -- we stayed with he
r at the flat, and I got to meet -- y ou know, 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      17 
a couple days after we got there she had a bi
g party and all her -- they had a big family. 
All their cousins came. Of course they all kn
ew me. They were all older than I am, and I 
was told how I used to
 bite Anita. I was told, you know, 
I had a purse and I used  to hit 
her with it, and the thing that really, really 
bothered me was that wh
en I left her mother 
lost her child, so her mother was really upset
 when  I had left. And one thing we learned 
just this year when we were 
back in London, from 
Anita, is that when 
I -- when my father 
came to -- when  Mr. Ness took me away, th
ey had -- Anita was 
out of the house. 
They -- they -- they took he
r someplace so she wouldn't see the departure, so she 
wouldn't, you know, get sad at me
 leaving, and I just found th
at out this year. I didn't 
know about that before. Anyway, we -- you 
know, like I say, we met the family , and I 
was -- I was really unhappy that 
I, you know, caused that much 
pain to the mother. It just 
never occu rred to me. Why I don't know, and 
the night before we left for England my 
mother had called me and she says find out wh
at happened to Eva. 
That was a little girl 
that went ahead of me in 1939
, and I said, who is Eva? That's
 the first I ever heard about 
it. So she told me. So I -- Eva was there in Gl
asgow at this -- this 
party. She was one of 
the cousins. Her parents didn't ma ke it through, 
so she -- she stayed there, and sh e is, you 
know, the child of the family th
at adopted her. So that was -- 
that worked out very nice.  
It was -- it was a pretty good reunion, and, 
you know -- you know, we
 keep in touch still 
to this day, and I finally convinced  An ita that 
-- to come to the states
 a couple years later. 
So in 1995, scared 
to death to fly, just actually petr
ified of flying, she and Eva came, and 
we -- you know, we went all over. We went to
 San Francisco, went to Vegas, went to 
Disneyland. They  wo uldn't even get on the 
people mover at Disneyland. That's how 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      18 
scared the people were. I was amazed at how sh
eltered and scared they were. I finally got 
them on there, and we went of co urse to s
ee my mother, who lived 
in Orange County at 
that time, and my  mo th er wouldn't talk about 
it. I couldn't get -- my  mo ther, you know, 
really wouldn't talk about it. 
She did get the Spielberg tapes,
 very, very reluctantly and 
never watched them. She was just -- it was just
 too hard for her, but she did it because we 
really pushed her. Mainly my  wife pushed he
r, and so I finally cornered my mother. I 
said, you know, you're the only living person th
at has met Eva's mo ther, and you have to  
talk to her. So they finally 
went into a room. I don't know 
what happened, but hopefu lly 
she told her something. So that's  basically , you know, my  story. I keep in touch with 
Anita, and we went over for the Bar Mitzvah of
 her grandson in -- in '97 I believe it was, 
and then  we went over again in June of this
 year. We went to London. I took two of my 
grandkids, an 18-year-o ld grandson and a 
21-year-old granddaugh
ter. We took them 
there, and I made arrangements for Anita to co
me down to -- to visit us in -- in London, 
and we went to the -- we went to the war 
-- to the Kindertransport Monument. We finally 
found it. It took a wh ile be
cause nobody knows where it is. 
We found it and took a lot of 
pictures there with the kids, and then Anita
 came down, and both 
her daughter and her 
son live in London, alth
ough th ey don't speak to each ot
her, so they came in sep arate 
groups, and we sat down and we talked, and it was kind of interesting to  see the reaction 

of my  grandkids. You know, they were really
 taken. They really never -- you know, I've 
told them the story, but they never really, you
 know, got to hear th
is as firsthand, you 
know, knowledge, first hand ta
lking ab out wh at happened, and th en  her daughter came 
with her -- her son, and so we had another -- 
you know, another round 
of talks, and that 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      19 
was basically it. That is my story. 
Q: Did you ever go to  your native town  in Germany? 
A: No. I've never been  -- I've been back to
 Germany. I went back  -- when I worked at 
Burroughs (ph), I went to Belgium, and 
I went to Germany fo
r one day because I 
had -- and I met my uncle. He is the only -- 
the only relative I have ever met. Well, I 
shouldn't say that. I me t some of my  cousins 
but the only one of that
 -- of that generation 
I met, and, you know, he was 
a doctor in Bonn, and so I went and had lunch with him and 
his wife. That's -- that's all. That --
 that was the only day, up in Germany. 
Q: Did you have -- 

A: I don't travel well so I just don't go mu ch.   
Go ahead. 

Q: Yeah. Did -- did you have some fami ly w
ho stayed  back then in Germany wh en your 

parents -- 
A: Yeah. My grandfather -- my
 father's  father and mothe
r, they were both dead. My 
grandfather on my  mo th er's side
 and her sister Kate did not 
want to leave Germany, and 
they were -- I know Kate -- there was a Ga
stronaught (ph). We have the Red Cross 
report, and my father (sic) was in a -- lik
e a ghetto, a small ghetto, and I don't recall 
exactly where, but he was sick and he was old 
so he just probably 
passed away in there, 
don't have any real documentati
on on him. All my  uncles -- my  aunt, my  father's oldest 
sister, went to England. I don't know when . 
All my  uncles left. One of them was in 
Argentina, and the rest of them went to Isra
el, so they all got out,
 so the only ones -- the 
only really close relatives I had was my  -- my
 grandfather and my  aunt, and they  both 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      20 
perished. They bot
h stayed back. 
Q: And did your parents ever go back to their -- 
A: My parents went back. My 
parents went back. My father was very leery of going. He 
says, I know, you don't want 
to go and say goodbye to  them because he figured  that 
would be his last trip, but they went ba
ck, and they eventually went to Israel 
and -- and -- and Germany, and they -- they sa
w -- they saw the people. My Aunt Hannah 
(ph) came to the United States, but I never me
t her because I was in Utah, and I don 't -- I 
still don't know to th is day when  she was co
ming through Utah, my father said don't 
go -- don't go to  the station. I don't know why.
 It was very strange, and my  father was 
such an easy person to get along with. I ju
st don't know what happened. So mething went 
wrong, but yeah, even tu ally mo st of them 
moved back to Germany, and mo st of my  
cousins are in Germany and in Israel. I tried --
 my  father was the youngest. I'm the oldest 
of the next generation. I tried to get us toge
ther, and my  mo ther said you're going to  get 
one response. I think there is 12 of us, and I 
got one response, and n
obody was interested .  
I have seen a few of my cousins as they come
 to the states, and, yo
u know, if they come 
to LA I usually meet w ith th
em, and one of my  cousin's  s
ons was in Orange Co unty so  
we met with him quite often,
 but they moved to Texas. 
Q: So let's continue. 

A: That's basically it. I -- I don't have any more to -- 
Q: Have you heard from your pa
rents what happened to  their property back in  Germany? 
A: I know they got restitution. 
Q: Oh, th ey did? 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      21 
A: I don't -- I don 't know -- the property -- 
the sawmill was sold, and, you know, ten cents 
on th e dollar or some -- some ridiculous amount
, so that was sold. My
 father's store, he 
sold -- my  grandfather's store, very early on
, you know, '34, end of
 '33, '34 the brown 
church started coming in -- you know, standi
ng in front of the store and telling people 
don't go in here because this is owned by Jews
, you know, so he eventu
ally sold  it and he 
moved in  with -- with my  father and mo th er and my self in Reichenbach. He moved in 
with us, so that's the 
only property we basically had, and 
so -- I have the bill of sale. It 
was sold to -- you know, sold by 
Arnold Wolff, a Jew, to Doct
or such and such, Arian.  
It's right on the -- on the bill of sale.  

Q: And you told this story to  your -- to
 your kids, right, and to  your grandkids?  
A: Yeah, kids and grandkids. I'm writing a book
. I'm an engineer. I don't write well, so 
it's very slow, but I am trying to. 

Q: What is their attitude -- attitude to 
your experience, to them being Jewish? 
A: Well, it was basically -- well, both of my  
kids married out of th eir -- you know, their 

spouses were not Jewish, alt
hough my -- and they are both
 divorced now so it doesn't 
really matter, but they have nothing. I 
think my  -- my  daughter has converted to 
Christianity, so she's b asically lost, and her --her son is being raised as a Christian, and 

so that 's my youngest gr
andson. My oldest grandson is ma
rried. He's married
 to an Italian 
Mexican gal, and I don't know -- they -- I don't 
think th ey do anything. His -- her side of 
the family did nothing, and my
 -- my  son did nothing. Wh en 
my son got married, he went 
to our rabbi, and he wanted him to -- to ge
t married -- you know, to marry them, and at 
that time the -- you know, the refo rm didn't do 
mixed marriages so they refu sed them, so 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      22 
they -- we lost them totally
. That kind of soured him on 
ev erything. Now that he is 
divorced and he is -- he has had majo
r health problems -- he had a bypass 
operation -- now he is coming back. He has join
ed a temple and he is
 on the choir and he 
is starting to come back . He came up to Rosh 
Hashanah for services 
with us, so he is 
coming back after th fo
ld. My granddaughter today as a ma
tter of fact is going to Israel 
on th e Birthright trip. She is leaving from 
New York probably right
 about now, so I 'm 
curious -- very curious to s
ee what the effect will be wh
en she comes back. I know 
that -- she was also in London
 with me. They were very ta
ken by the Holocaust Museum 
in London, and then  wh en they
 heard the story, you know, th
at -- that really affected 
them. They were -- the other kid that was th
ere, Mikey, my  middle grandson, you know, 
he is a real goff-off, and he was -- he was all ea
rs, and he was really attentive, and he told 
me, he says if you don't publish your book I w
ill, so he was -- I know -- I know he took it 
very seriously, and it finally -- I think it fi
nally sunk in. The 12-ol
d-year old -- it was 
interesting. In Santa Barbara there is -- they di
d an exhibition. It's a room that the Jewish 
Federation did. I guess they copied Toronto.
 Toronto has a wall of Holo caust survivors, 
not particularly KTA but just 
Holocaust survivors, where they
 have big plaques. They 're 
probably  ab out, oh, a foot and-a-half wide and 
about three or four foot tall, three foot tall, 
where they have the pictures and the stories 
of the -- of the survivors, and Santa Barbara 
copied th at, and I'm one on the wall, and so 
we do -- we do -- we do 
speak to groups. I go 
out several times a year and speak to school
s or -- or you know, sometimes universities, 
sometimes adults, whenever 
-- whenever somebody comes 
and asks, so we do do th at, 
and when  my  grandson, the youngest one, Jos
hua, was in third grade they were learning 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      23 
the Holocaust, which kind of 
surprised me. I thought it was 
a little early. Of course my 
daughter told the teacher about it so I was i
nvited to speak, and I spoke, and th ey  had  
one -- they  had ab out -- about 25 kids in 
the classroom. One -- one was a problem. You 
know, he had attention deficit, but the rest of
 them were just amazin
gly attentive, and to 
be honest with you, I got the be
st questions from those kids that I ever got on any sp eech.  
Most of the time we talked
 to, you know, high schoolers,
 and it's not cool to ask 
questions so they don't ask a 
lot of questions, but I don't k
now -- since then Joshua has 
probably not even 
thought about it.  
Q: Looking back at -- at your life in England 
and the early years of 
your life, do you think 
that this Kindertransport and Ho locaust expe
rience was decisive in your life, like did it 
affect certain decisions? 
A: I don't think so. I don't think so because 
I was so young. You know, I talked  to some 
of the fellow, you know, Kindertransporters, 
and it's kind of the same story. The younger 
ones, we did okay. Of course my  mo ther took
 the extra effort to 
place with me with a 
family and some of them just went over. You 
know, some of them went with  siblings and 

they were separated. Some of them went to
 -- into farms where they were put to work, 
and so, you know, some of them 
had a harder life than I had. I was so young. It just -- by 
the time I -- I got to Bolivia I was five 
years old, and, you know, life from there 
was -- you know, I wasn't used 
to anything else. You know, 
we were -- we were poor, 
and we -- we did what we c
ould. You know, until we got to
 living in -- in the company 
house we were -- you know, in real dumps so 
to speak, and after th
at it was -- you know, 
it's always -- you do wh at yo
u have to. You know, that -- th
at was my parent's way, you 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      24 
know, and, you know, today ov
er here my  mother would have to go to therapy and 
whatever to -- to recover, but, you know, it 
wasn't done. I don't know how she gave me 
up. I just -- I can't visualize giving my  one 
child, you know, at three years old, giving 
them away and not knowing wh
ether you 'll ev er see them ag
ain. Yo u know, how hard is 
that? Just -- you know, it was just unbelieva
ble what they went thro ugh, but fo r me it 
was -- you know, I just don't have a me mo ry 
of anything. The only bad thing probably 
happened  when  I crossed the Atlantic and we ha
d some gunfire, and that's about it. That's  
about all I heard. 
Q: Do you reme mb er when  you just came to
 Bolivia what your parents were speaking 
about, talking to each other 
about the situation in Europe
, about Nazis and what was 
going on? Do you rememb er that? 

A: The only thing -- the only thing I rememb
er really is when  we -- I don't rememb er 
anything wh en we first got there. They  probably
 wouldn't have talked in front of me.  I'm 
sure of that, and -- well, then I started le
arning German so I could understand it. I 
remember very distinc
tly the day the war was over in Eu
rope, there was a -- k ind of like a 
bachelor's quarters for the peop
le that worked for the mini
ng -- you know, there was an 
American mining comp any. They had a big pa
rty, and the only ti
me I saw my  mo th er 
drunk. She got tipsy . That's the 
only time, and the first comment she made is, I'm going to 
go see wh at happened  to -- you know, to her 
father and her sister and contact the Red 
Cross right away. We didn't  he
ar for almo st 15 years later, but
 that was her first action.  
That's  the only time I really 
remember them talking. Ther
e were always -- there was a 
group of Nazis in town, and we never associ
ated, and they were always, you know, the 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      25 
enemy, and even when I went to
 school in Aurora (ph) ther
e was a big group of Nazis in 
there, and, you know, it was -- 
we never associated with them, and mo st of the kids I 
went to school with were -- were Gentiles. 
There was a few Jews. We
ll, eventually I lived 
with a Jewish family in Auro
ra (ph), and, you know, they 
were the same way. We just 
stuck to each other and I ne
ver associated with them. 
Q: And nowadays do 
you feel more like you're Jewish 
or American? Do you keep a more 
Jewish traditional life or --  
A: We go to temple very seldom. We do
 -- we do the holidays. We always have a 
Passover. We belong to Havurah, you know, in
 -- in our temple, and so we have that 
extended family, but we don't really practic
e Judaism. You know, we do it during the 
holidays and we do Passover and we do -- we
 do a little bit of Hanu
kah, but Passover is 
always big, but, you know, we celebrate Tha
nksgiving big, and my  wi
fe was -- was what 
they call a valley girl in Los Angeles, and th
ey're sort of Jews. Y
ou know, they -- they 
had a Ch ristmas tree, and th ey -- you know, 
they -- I don't think 
her -- except for her 
father nobody ever went to temple. She is 
probably mu ch  mo re religious now th an she 
ever was because she is part of the choir at
 the temple. She belong
s to the sisterhood. I 
belong to  the B'nai B'rith -- you know, the B'
nai B'rith Lodge in to
wn , bu t mo st o f  my  
friends are Jewish, You know, not all of them 
but most of them, but we -- we don't really 

practice the religion. 
Q: Well, do you want to add something to
 the story about your -- experiences?  
A: Not much. You know, it is 
what it is and, you know, y
ou kind of roll with it. You 
know, I was always taught my  parents, you kn
ow, you do the best you can and that's it, 

InterviewwithMichaelW.Wolff      26 
you know. Things happen. You know, who kn
ows wh at would have happened ? We were 
just talking downstairs with 
one of the Kindertransport -- yo
u know, do you ev er think of 
what would have happened if there hadn 't been
 a Hitler? I said, well, my son wouldn't be 
here. That was one thing. 
Well, who knows? Who knows? 
Q: Well, Mr. Wolff, I would liketo thank you for the time -- 
A: Well, thank you. 
Q: Thank you fo r the amazing story, and good 
luck with your book. Thank you so mu ch. 
A: Thank you. 
Q: And this concludes the United States Holo
caust Museum interview story with Michael 
Wolff conducted by Julia Danilina on Octo
ber 17th of 2010 at 
the Kindertransport 
conference in Arlington, Virg
inia. Thank you very much. 
A: Thank you.
