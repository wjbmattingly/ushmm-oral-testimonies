, 
Illinois
. Thank you very much Mr. 
Gubala
, for 
agreeing to meet with us today, and to 
share some of your experiences from the 
war, and from the postwar years. What I™d lik
e to do is talk a great deal about the 
world, and the life that you had before any 
of these events, before the war started. 
So, I™m going to  start at the very beginning. Could you tell me, what was your name

Q: Congratulations. 
A: Thank you. 

Q: And where were you born? 
A: I was born in 
Wa rsa w
, 
Warsaw
,
 Poland
. This was 
Ho sia
(ph) 
Street
 three, the 
building is still existing there. 
Q: Really? 

A: This was Œ yes. Well, it was damaged du ring the uprising, but still, the structure 
is there. So whenever I visit 
Warsaw
, I take a glimpse of that building. And during 
the occupation, actually, I di
dn™t live in that area. 
Q: You lived  Œ you were elsewhere? 

A: Yes. But a Œ my  parish was a church , holy Œ holy Œ the 
Alexander 
Church in 
Three Crosses Square
 in 
Warsaw
. 
Q: Is that the center of town, or is
 that a little bit outside the center? 
A: I would say it™s close to center, 
yes, close to center, because the 
Royal Tr-Tra ck 
starts from 
Wilanów
, all the way to the old town in 
Warsa w
, but this is part of that 
section that covers that distance. They call it the 
Ro ya l Tra c k
 
[speaks Polish] 
This 
is in Polish. But 
No wy  
˛
wia t
, the New World, actually 
started from that square, 
Three Crosses Square
.

Q: Okay . What kind of a build ing did 
you grow up in ? Was it a huge apartment 
build ing, or single fami ly Œ 
A: No, it was in an apart Œ it was about five
 story build ing, five 
story building, yes. 
Q: Built when, in the 19
th
 century, or the 20
th
? 
A: This was, I would say, 20
th
 century already there, yes. 
Q: Okay . And how modern was it? Di
d it have electricity, for example? 

A: Oh, there were electricity, yes, 
electricity. We had the bathrooms Œ 
Q: Running water. 

A: Running water, yes,  yes. 

Q: Mm-hm, and plumbing, and all of
 that. So, it was a modern place. 
A: Yes, it was a modern place. 
Warsaw 
is a Œ as it grew, during the time after the 
first World War, this was under the Tsarist 
R u ssia
. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: But then, when 
Pilsudski
 came to power in 1918, 
Poland
 regained her 
independence, after 123 years of nonexistence, so to speak, of Œ 
Poland
 only 
existed only as partitions. 

Q: Yes. 
A: 
Poland
 was divided actually into three segm
ents, and this was Prussian, Russian, 
and Austro-Hungary . So actually, 
Warsaw
 was part of the Tsarist domain.

Q: So, when  
Poland
 became independent again, and 
the three parts became united, 
123 years is still quite a while, because 
it is more than liv
ing memory. Several 
generations are comp rised in that. Had 
people changed very
 mu ch? Could you 
understand one another Œ 
I mean psychologically? 
A: Well, there were different, let™s say,
 frames that the Pole
s grew, that say, 
Germans were very anti-Polish, and 
Ha ka tay
(ph) was the organization th at even 
forbad e the Polish language 
to be used at schools. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Russians were also trying to  bring th
eir influence to the point. And then, th e 

mo st tolerant part was the au Œ aus Œ aus Œ aus Œ 
Q: Austro-H ungarian? 
A: Aust-Austro-Hungarian part. Yeah, 
so that was was a Œ a little better for 
schooling, secondary  schooling an
d so on. And let™s say Poles from 
Galicia
? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You know, they were a little
 different in character than 
let™s say, Poles that were 
slightly Germanized under the ger Œ the 
Prussian operation, and th e Poles living 
under the Ru ssians. So, this process of fusi
ng us togeth er was actually a great, let™s 
say, accomplishment of the Catholic church , because they mostly Œ the Poles were 

of Catholic faith, and that was Œ the chur
ch was actually the 
strongest party that

existed in Œ in 
Poland
. But then when 
Pilsudski
 became  the Marshall of 
Poland
 Œ 
this was in 1914, and officially 
Poland
 regained her independence in the ™18, he 
was assigned a task of, let™s say, f u sing th
-the different characters of people that 
grew in different segments of the country. 
Q: So what were some of the Œ I 
mean, just curiosity Œ you say the 
Galicianas 
are 
different than those who were Œ and 
Galicia 
was under Austro-H ungarian ru le? 
A: Yes. 
Q: What kind of character di
d the one have in  comp arison to  the other two, and so 
on?
 
A: Let™s say the Œ the Œ let™s say the Germ
ans, Poles, from the German part, from 
the Prussian part were, let™s say, a little b
it more like Germans, very orderly, let™s 
say the work that th
ey accomplished was more thorough 
than let™s say the group of 
Poles in the east, under the Russians. And le
t™s say the Galicians were also a little 
bit closer to Œ to Œ to  Œ 
to German influence. But a
ll together, united by the faith, 
you know, we were 
very quickly re Œ 
reburn
(ph). 
Q: Reborn. 
A: Reborn, yes, reborn. 
Q: Yeah. And tell me a little bit Œ so, ther
e are questions that 
I usually ask people 
who were in the eastern territories, that do
n™t apply here, but I will just bring them

up. And that is, one of the Œ the issues that
 I want to find out about is the degree of 
modernization. So there I will ask,  yo
u know, did anybody 
have a radio? Did 
anybody have a telephone? Did they ha Œ 
did Œ were cars Œ automobiles common to 
see? Well, in the center of 
Warsaw
, I would assume th
at these things Œ 
A: Yes, the 
Poland
 was called Œ they called 
Poland 
at that time Œ the 
Warsaw
 was 
the Œ the Œ the 
Paris
 of the east. 
Q: Okay . 
A: That was Œ city was about one point 
two million people. And there Œ there was, 
let™s see, very large 
Jewish diaspora in 
Wa rsa w
. The diaspora was about 400,00, so 
every third 
Warsawian
 was of Œ of Hebrew  faith. So
me of them got more or less 
Poland-ized, then the 
Œ they were, let™s say, getting 
with the Poles closer, and the 
other ones were dep Œ 
Poland 
was free, as far as the relig
ion is concerned, so they 
had their ow-own synagogues, they had their own traditions, and they grew in  the 
environment that their predecessors
 are sort of giving them. But Œ 
Q: Did you Œ mm-hm, go ah ead. 

A: And 
Warsaw Œ Warsaw
 was specially Œ some distric ts of 
Warsaw
 were 
predominantly Jewish. The most fam
ous synagogue was the synagogue on 
T
omackie
 Street. Now, if you ever visit 
Warsaw
 at that area, was Œ actually is a

skyscraper about 40 stories high, a blue 
building that was, let™s say built after the 
war, in that area where that synagogue was. 
Q: Is there Œ 
A: And this was the most beautiful syna
gogue in the world, the largest, and Œ 
Q: Really? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Even though you weren™t 
Jewish Œ you aren™t Jewish, 
did you ever visit inside? 
Did you ever Œ 
A: Oh, my father Œ my father was always ve
ry, how should I say, trying to show me 
the Œ the 
cerkiew
, which is the Orthodox ch urch, we had one big chur Œ 
cerkiew
 in 
Praga
. Because 
Praga
 is not the Czech 
Prague
, it™s a Œ
 Warsaw
 was on th e left 
bank of th e 
Vistula
, looking north was 
Warsza wa
, was 
Warsaw
. On the right side 
was 
Praga
. 
Q: So it was like a Œ a district of 
Warsaw
, a section of 
Warsaw
. 
A: Well yes, th-the eastern part, you know
, the bridges connecte
d the city together. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And there was a 
cerkiew
, there was the Russian Or
thodox church. And very 
often he took me over to show the Œ ho
w they  pray , and how they , let™s say, 
celebrate their different religious Œ

Q: Services. 
A: Œ services. And there was a Œ in Œ in 
Warsaw
 I visited synagogues from time to 
time. Actually in my classroom, I had ma
ny Jewish friends that especially Œ 
Thursdays
 were the days when they were te
aching us religion;
 history of the 
Catholic churches, or at that time the Œ th
e Jewish minority was excused, they  could 
take a walk into the park, 
play soccer, or whatever. 
[phone ringing]
 
Q: Let™s cut.

something very interesting. 
A: Th-Thursday Œ  

Q: Oh, hang on a minute, let™s Œ  

A: Okay . 
Q: Yeah, you were talking about Thursday s at school. 
A: Thursday s at school. So, the Œ let™s say,
 students, pupils that were excused fo r 
that day, of Jewish faith, you know, so very
 often I Œ I Œ I joined them just to be out 
in the park, and pl
ay soccer. That Œ 
Q: I was Œ yeah, I was going to  say, weren™
t you jealous of thos
e kids who didn™t 
have to go to class? 

A: That™s right, you know, so I was what, ei
ght, seven Œ seven, eight years old, so at 
that time it was okay. 

Q: So, did you ever vi
sit this beautiful synagogue you to ld us Œ 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

11
A: Yes Œ 
Q: Œ wh en you were 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Œ I visited that synagogue. Yes, this 
was in 1936 or ™37, ye
ah, with my father. 
Q: So you were bor Œ yeah. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you have Œ 

A: Nowadays Œ nowadays they have 
T
omackie
 Street, and there is a Œ a Jewish, 
let™s say library, and Œ and a small mu se
um, because the main museum that was 
erected just th Œ one year 
ago, open  up, it™s one of the mo st beautiful, modern 
mu seum, they spend a lot of money. And I 
think th e Œ the help came from the good, 
old 
U
.
S
.
A
., you know, so Œ and then fa Œ I th
ink contribution was also made by the 
Polish president to build in 
the area where they have 
na lewki
(ph), and that was that 
infamous 
Umschlag pla tz
. That™s was the Œ the Jews we
re loaded on the trucks, and 
taken over to 
Treblinka
. So this was ex-Jewish district. 
Q: So, was the 
Umschlagplatz
 within the space of the ghetto, or outside of it? 
A: 
Umschlagplatz
 was on the periphery  of ghetto
, you know, but it was inside, 
inside yes. 
Q: It was inside, but at the edge. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
12
A: And the railroad tracks at 
Stawki
, there w ere, I think five tracks that the trains 
were coming in, because there was a Œ so
rt of like a 10 Œ 10,000 Œ 10,000 a day 
were trying to unload from 
Warsaw
 and send them to 
Treblinka
. 
Q: So when Œ when Œ when  Jews were be
ing loaded onto Œ y
ou™d say trucks, and 
then to trains, or how would th ey be Œ 

A: No, they were Œ they were Œ they were walking toward the tra Œ 
Umschlagplatz
. 
There were no trucks actua
lly in the ghetto, no. 
Q: Okay . 

A: They were streetcars, but they were 
not used. Normally th
e cruel police force 
were the actually Jewish police, because th
ey were obliged to bring the contin gent 
of so many Jews for that particul
ar day, that were shipped to 
Treblinka
. 
Q: So th ey would go
 by foot to the 
Umschlagplatz
? 
A: But foot, with Œ they were normally to
ld that they are going east for some places 
that they will be employed and work for th
e upkeep  of their own lives, and so on. 
So they  were Œ they were 
lied about this designation of 
Treblinka
, because this was 
the end of the trip, 
so to speak, of Œ 
Q: Yeah. And it was by train? 
A: By train, yes. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
13
Q: By train. Now, you say this was with
in the ghetto Œ the ghetto itself, but on the 
periphery. Did you ever see anything
 like this, were you able to see it? 
A: No, I Œ let™s see. I h ad my school lo
cated Œ let™s start from a different point. 
There were two ghettos actually. 
There was small ghetto, south of 
Wolska 
Street, 
which was main thoroughfare through 
Wa rsa w
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And there was a large ghetto north of it. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And normally they build  a wall around 
small and large ghettos, so this whole 
area was isolated. Along the 
Wolska 
Street, between 
Wro n ia
 and  
)
elazna
, this 
was a point where two ghettos were Œ 

Q: Connected? 

A: Œ connected, yes. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And they were also at the place like 
)
ela zna
 and 
Ch
odna
, this was a bridge 
that was connecting small ghetto with larg
e ghetto. That bridge
 you could see in 
that film of pianist, by Œ 

Q: That™s right, by 
Roman Po lanski
. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
14
A: 
Polanski
, yes. This bridge I remember well,
 and that portion of wall, and the 
main gate to the ghetto, I remember very
 well because my school was like Œ during 
the occupation, you know, the secondary 
schooling was forbidden for the Po les. 
Q: Okay . 
A: 
Hitler
 wanted us only to know how to  coun
t to a hundred, write and read, and 
that™s it. A nd we were designated for what they call 
ko nnektenvolk
(ph). 
Q: 
Konnektenvolk
(ph). 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What is 
ko nnektenv o lk
(ph)? 
A: 
Konnekten
(ph), it Œ it™s a subdue human 
beings work ing for the Œ 
Q: Overlo rds. 

A: Œ overlords, yes. 

Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: I see. 
A: So th is was Œ this was school located 
Œ trade school, actually, this was trade 
school, because no secondary schools were a
llowed. But in that trade school we had 
schooling, secondary  scho
oling undercover, we say. We used to say yeah, 
po d 
pokrywk

 gymnasium 
pod po krywk

. The secondary school was under the cover. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
15
Q: Okay . 
A: So even we had the uni
versities and polytechnics, ever
ything was unofficially 
forbidden, but undergro und was acting. So , 
going to my trade sc
hool Œ actually, this 
was the first class of gymnasium we call it, high school, I was passing th e main gate 

Œ 

Q: Of the ghetto. 

A: Œ and actually right by th at brid
ge, what you saw in that film.  
Q: Okay . 

A: Walking there. So this was close. Th
is portion was Aryan portion, so we saw it, 
everything what was goin
g on behind the wall. 
Q: So you would 
see over the wall? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What were the things
 that you were seeing? 

A: Well, the buildings. The street was divi
ded by the wall, and these houses there, 
the Œ cause ghetto was overpopulated. At th
at time, some of the houses are already 
empty, because that process of sendi
ng Jews to the death chambers in 
Treblinka
 
was Œ vacated a lot of space, leaving sp ace 
in the buildings. So that was neglected. 
On top of the wall, actually
, the Germans set up machine 
guns. There were, actually 
at that time, some of the pe
ople that came from the ukra Œ 
Ukraine
 Œ Ukrainians 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

were guarding the Jewish ghetto, and Latvia
ns were guarding the Jewish ghetto. 
And the Germans were in the supervisory positions. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So what I saw there? I remember wh
en the Jewish uprising started, this Œ 
Q: Well, we™ll talk about that later on. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: We™ll go back  now to Œ 
A: So guide me to whatever Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ because I don™t want to jump from one Œ 
Q: That™s okay. 
A: Œ subject to another Œ 

Q: That™s okay. 

A: Œ because this gonna be a Œ 
Q: You™re Œ yeah , bu-but you ™re explaining things in a ve
ry interesting fashion. And 
we started with the synagogue, and th e b
eautiful synagogue that Œ that was there 
before the war. And I™d like to ask Œ yo
u know, you were a young boy wh en  you 
were there. 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
17
Q: But do you rememb er anything from the 
inside of that synagogue, of what it 
looked like to you? 
A: Not the Œ the Œ the altar, the decorations, 
the building, the walls. I have a picture, 
but not too vivid, you know. 

Q: Was it big? Was it a Œ 

A: Hm? Oh yes, very large. Very large 
building. Very large 
building there. There 
was a Torah displayed there, and that seven Œ seven candles. 
Q: The me norah . 
A: Yeah, menorah. Then th Œ then I reme
mb er, and I listened to some of the can-
cantors? I used to hear the singers. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So th ey had the very  good singers. 

Q: Did you go during service times? 

A: Mm Œ no, no, no. But th
ey had some practices durin
g that time, so that we 
walked in and we were pe
rmitted to look 
around, and Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. Well, it sounds Œ it was unusual th
at your father would think of it, to 
take you to the church es of different 
religions, and the wo rshipping houses of 
different religions. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
18
A: You know, war Œ
 Wa rsa w
 was actually like an international sort of a 
metropoly
(ph), and we had the majority Po les, okay, that was about 800,000 Poles 
at that time, and 400,000 were Jews. But we
 had Germans, we ha
d Lithuanians, and 
different nationalities living in Œ in Œ in 
Warsaw
. 
Q: And your father, was he a Œ 
an international kind of person? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: No? So what was his reason fo
r bringing you to these places? 
A: Well, he wanted to Œ let™s say to satis
fy my curiosity. I was always, let™s say, 
curious of what the other people, how 
they pray, what th
ey do, an d how the 
ceremony goes, you Œ so  I Œ I reme mb er when I visited 
cerkiew
, which was that 
Orthodox. The only thing that was Œ that I 
rememb er was the Œ a lot of herbs, and 
holy Œ 

Q: The incense. 

A: Œ things Œ in Œ yes, th
-they were burning, and the sm
oke of it, you know, then Œ 
then I started Œ 

Q: Tearing up. 

A: Œ getting tears in my Œ tear
ing up, and then he said ok
ay, that™s Œ that™s enough. 
But he Œ he wanted me to know, le
t™s say, what the city is like. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
19
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s Œ let™s turn a little bit 
then to your own home, which is, I started 
asking ab out the physical, how it looked  phys
ically, and if you could paint a picture 
for me. 
A: Our Œ our apartment was, let™s say, 
within a comp lex Œ that was industrial 
complex. My father was wo
rking for the transportation 
com Œ company, and where 
he was in the Œ in th is storage, purchasing 
the tires, different parts for the buses that 
were in the workshop, repa
ired. Our apartment consiste
d of one large room. There 
was a bed, and two bedrooms, and a kitchen. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: You know, for 
Warsaw
 that was a nice Œ 
Q: Nice size. 

A: Nice size of place. And the next, adj
acent building was a large building, built 
during the Tsarist times, I think, that they
 had three different factories. That was a 
textile factory, there was 
some mechanical shop, and 
the top was some chemical 
establishment there. So we didn™t have 
many neighbors, you say civilians, because 
we were part of that industrial complex.
 My mother was runn
ing a little cafeteria, 
for one place, and the fa
ther was working for the 
P o lska  Linia  Samo chodo wa
, 
which was the transportation company. 

Q: Mm-hm. Was it a p rivate comp
any, or state-owned co mp any? 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
20
A: I would say this was a private comp any, yes, yes. 
Q: Okay . Ok ay. And the Œ and was it that
 it w as the co Œ a company apartment? 

That is, it belonged to the 
comp any, but people who work ed there could rent them 
out? 

A: Yes, th-this is Œ this Œ wh en we moved from 
Hosia
(ph) 
Street
, because this part 
here is 
Krochma
na
 part. This is away from the cent
er of the city. This was in the 
suburb called 
Wola
, 
w-o - l-a
, 
Wola
. 
Q: I see. And when  did you m

A: And my father was

Ho sia

Q: Mm-hm. Did you have aunts

A: Oh yes, my mother™s brothe
r, we owned a little 
summer home in 
Otwock
 that 
was east Œ east of 
Warsaw
, within the network of electrical trains. S o  we were 
communicating on weekends to 
Stara Wie

Q: 
Stara Wie
˚
. 
A: Old village. 

Q: And it was Œ and 
Otwock
 was a region, or a village, or a town?

Otwock
 was the largest city that the elec

there. So

A: This was around, let™s say, 30 kilometers or so. 
Q: So it was almo st like a suburb. 

A: Yes, almost like a 
suburb. Now, as the 
Warsaw 
is growing, the 
Otwock
 is 
getting closer and closer. 

Q: I remember the Œ I remember 
Otwock
, because there was a diary of a ghetto 
policeman from 
Otwock
 that was written. A very interesting book Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ and a very heartrendi
ng book, because he was writi
ng about his dilemma being 
a policeman. He did 
not survive the war. 
A: Mm-hm. Now 
Otwock
 I also knew durin g the occupation, but maybe that™s a 
subject we should touch later on, that Œ 
Q: Well, let™s see, and we™ll see. 

A: When the Germans caught me at the ma
in railroad station, because we had some 
busin ess with the Hu ngarians, or Romani
ans and Germans, that was going to  the 
eastern front, you know, to Œ for a Œ for a 
cover-up I used to be selling cigarettes or 
newspapers, something, because we deal 
Œ we dealt with the Hungarians and the 
other sold iers for schnapps. We could bu
y some good material for our, let™s say 
weapons, even pistols and so
 on. So when I was arrest
ed by the Germans, I was 
young Œ 12 years Œ or 12 - 13 years old, 
and th ey put me in the prison on 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015

Poznanska Street
, and I Œ they  kept me there Œ because Germans actually gave to 
the blue policeman. We had Po lish police. 
On the Polish side they were in blue 
unifo rms, and th e German gendarmerie, th
at was the German police that actually 
cooperated with the Polish po
licemen. And they gave me, as a youngster to the blue 
policemen, and they put me in jail. So
 I spend there a few weeks, and what 

happened  is that I Œ I was young, unde
rnourished, and I had some beginning of 

tuberculosis. So the Polish underground, wh
en they saw what was happening to me, 
they sent me to 
Olenika
(ph), which was the sanitorium near 
Otwock
. 
Q: I see. 
A: And there I was, let™s say, for a few months, to kill that Œ 
Q: Tuberculosis? 
A: Œ beginning to Œ tuberculos
is, I had sha Œ shadows in my
 lungs that were the sarg 
Œ larger size of a plum or an apple. And 
this finally was arrested and calcinations 

were formed, and I didn™t have an open tube
rculosis. So th ey saved my  life, so to 
speak. Tu-T uberculo sis was, during th e time of occupation of 
Poland
 was a very 

common problem, because people
 are undernourished, and Œ 
Q: Was it a killer? 
A: Hm? 
Q: Wa Œ did people di
e from tuberculosis? 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
25
A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Open  tuberculosis is very contagious. 
Q: Okay. So there are many reasons to tr
y and catch it, not only for the person 
themselves, but so that it 
wouldn™t become infectious 
and an epi Œ an epidemic. 
A: Yes, yes. No, the Œ the Œ it was very
 close to epidemic, because we were 
receiving about 1500 calories, and that was 
not enough to Œ to 
Œ to die, and not 
enough to live normal life. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So the Poles were starvi
ng, but the poor Jewish guys,
 they were even worse, 
because they were getting abou
t 500 calories a day. So they
 were destined for death. 
Q: Yeah. Okay, let™s re
turn prewar. Was your family very religious? 
A: I would say yes; Father especially, 
and my mo ther. And nearby Œ I mentioned 
the church where I was 
baptized; this was the 
Saint Alexander 
church on 
Three 
Crosses Square
 in Warsaw. But when we 
moved, we belonged to 
Saint 
Clement™s
. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: These were the Œ oh, I forgot that 
Œ maybe it will come back to me, but the 
parish nearby, we were memb
ers of that parish, and dur
ing th e uprising, and during

the occupation, we attended the masses re
gularly on Œ on Su nday . And that was 
only couple blocks away . This church ac
tually, I found that was damaged, yes, 
damaged, but it was rebuilt, and it™s still existing in. 
Q: So did you go weekly to 
Œ was it a Œ was it a family 
tradition to go to mass every 
Sunday? 
A: Yes, every Sunday we went to mass,
 and Œ at this church, or church Œ 
B o ro m eu s z 
Church. This was close to the main en
trance to the ghetto. This was at 
the point wh ere I mentioned street

ela zna
. Actually at that point 
W
odna 
and  
Elektoralna
, that was a 
Y
, sort of branches, that the church was in that triangle. 
Q: Oh, I see. 
A: And this was something that I had to 
be there on Su ndays, and some other big 
holid ays, because that was sort
 of oblig atory from the school. 
Q: Ah. So Œ 

A: So th e school Œ the schools™ students, 
pupils, were going to that special mass for 
the students. 

Q: And that would be on a sc
hool day, or on Sundays? 
A: This was Sunday s, and major holid ays Œ

Q: Saint days and th ings. 
A: This was before the war. 

Q: Yes, I™m talking before the war. 
A: Before the war, yes. 
Q: Yeah, before the war. And you said th
at you had Œ it was 
a public school that 
you went to? 

A: Yes, the school was numbe
r 100. It was a new build i
ng, built during the 20 years 
of Po lish independence, and I rememb er it 
very well, because that was a walking 
distance. And school was very clean, well ill
uminated. We used to have a very  soft 
Œ soft slippers that we couldn™t bring th
e shoes normally from the street, with the 
hard soles that would damage shini
ng floors. Nice windows, big windows; 

classrooms were spacious. So that was a 
nice time that I had 
during the time til 
1939 Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ attending. And I finished, 
I think the fourth grade.  
Q: In Œ an d Œ by 1939. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . Tell me  a little bit about your mo
ther and father™s own family histories. 
Had they , either of them finished university, or gone to  university? 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
28
A: No, my  Œ no, they  didn™t have a high
er education. My mo ther comp leted high 
school; and Father, he was sort of a 
business-minded man, and he did not get 
university studies behind him.
 But he was, let™s say a ju nior college, education-
wise. And he served, during th e time when 
Poland
 was still partitioned, he served 
in the 
Austria
 army , so his German was excellent, and partially I inherited the 
German language from him. So he was Œ 
during th e occupation, he was employed 
by th e 
Ostbahn
. 
Ostb ahn
, east railroad Œ the Germans had westbound, eastbound, 
Reich
-
ba hn
. So this was part of the 
Reich-bahn
, and he was, as an interpreter, 
working at the main central statio n there. 
Q: Oh. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Well, that™s quite an in
teresting position to  have. 
A: Yes. 

Q: So you were Œ the main
 central station for the 
ost
, for the east. 
A: For the east. 

Q: Okay . 

A: Yes. This was located on the 
Jerusalem 
alley, and it™s still there, but the 
build ing was comp letely, let™s say, destroye
d, but that area was used for the new 

structure that is the center 
Warsaw 
station. Very nice building, near Œ near that Œ

what do they call it, the gift from 
Stalin
, near the palace of the Œ the 
Stalin 
palace, 
but this was Œ 
Q: Oh, I think I know th e building you mean. 
A: Œ a Œ a left Œ did you see that building? 
Q: It looks almo st like the one at mo  Œ in 
Mo sco w
, with similar structure. 
A: Yes. This was a styl e that the Russians 
ca Œ kept, that they preserved build ing the 
structures according to the drawings th
at they made for their university in 
Moscow
. 
So the 
Alexanderplatz 
in 
Berlin
 was similar to this. Well,
 this was despised by the 
Poles, th-they used to  laugh. 
I remember the first visit in 
Poland
 in 1950 Œ ™59, 
when  driv ing with the guy that was a taxi dr
iver, he asked me, says, the best view of 
Warsaw
? You know where you get the best view of 
Wa rsa w
? He says, the best 
view of 
Wa rsa w
 you get from the palace. I said, 
oh yeah? Why is that so? Well, 
cause when you in the palace, you do
n™t see the palace. You know, so Œ 
Q: Even the taxi driver. 
A: Even the taxi driver, yes. He says that
 he Œ he was going a little further, he says, 
even that antenna th
at they built Œ they 
built that was a protective weapon that no 
Pole could climb up on the very  top and 
do things, dirty things. They hated the 
structure, you know. It™s still existing.
 It™s like a monument of the Ru ssian 
occupation of Œ of 
Poland
. And th is was a gift.

because she was witnessing the erection of 
that Œ 
Q: The construction of this building. 
A: The construction of this, yes. I saw it 
finished. Now it™s dark. When Œ when you 
see when the two systems me
et, the Œ th-the monument of the communism, versus 
against the Œ the Œ the capitalis
m, so to speak, of the s
kyscrapers, you know, na Œ 
modern buildings. It is Œ it is a contrast
 that you cannot simp ly understand, you 
know, how the Russians could 
build such a awful structure in the midst of that 
modern new 
Warsaw
 that is growing Œ growing up. 
Q: Well, you know, in Œ architecture ha
s its own stories. In architecture and 
geography too. You know, geography you woul
d think is such a neutral subject, but 
geography encompasses maps an d street 
names, and those changed so often, 
because of whatever political 
force happened to be in pow
er in this part of the 
world. Okay  Œ 

A: You can Œ you can actually take a Œ 
Poland 
as an example of a migratory nation, 
because when you look Œ when you lo
ok at the history, the union with 
Lithuania
 
was what, 15
th
 century, when we 
were one co untry, 
Poland
 was actually the largest

state in Œ in Œ in Œ in 
Europe
; from the 
Black Sea
 all the way to the black Œ 
Baltic 
Sea
. 
Q: That™s right. 
A: And the borders were changing so mu
ch, going eastbound, we
stbound, and that™s 
why the Poles are of some different char
acters, because the days of occupation 
changed the people. And since the 
borders moved, the people moved. 
Q: That™s true, that™s true. 
A: That was tr-tragic in a way, but 
when Polish border
s were set up in 
Yalta
, 
Potsdam
 and other places wh
ere the destiny of 
Poland
 was set up with the 
matches, they were laughing th at 
Churchill
,
 Stalin
 and 
President Roosevelt
, they 
were setting up the borders of 
Poland
 with the m Œ 
Q: With the matchstick s. 
A: Œ matches. And then  the famous 
Curzon
 line, the 
[indecipherable]
 of 
C u rzo n
, 
you know, that divided the po
rtion of eastern part of 
Poland
, and the western part 
of 
Poland
. 
Q: You mean during the war itself? 

A: During the war itself. In 1939 Œ we
 jumping from subject to subject. 
Q: We are. It™s okay. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
32
A: But that mixture maybe will give you a 
little better id ea what Œ that time, in  ™39, 
there was that infamous pact of 
Ribben trop-Molotov
. Thirty-nine when the 
Russia
 
was befriended with 
Reich
. 
Q: With 
Germany
. 
A: With 
Germany
. And this was Œ we call it the fourth partition of 
Poland
, and the 
border line, 
Curzon
 
Line
 actually came into picture. Because now Œ it Œ there is a 
certain similarity what
 they doing now in 
Ukraine
, you know, when 
they coming to 
protect their brothers and sisters, living 
in the administrative 
territory of eastern 
Ukraine
, that was happening in  the eastern part of 
Poland
. They came to resc Œ 
rescue the Ukrainians minority
 that lived there, and the 
Byelorussian 
minority, and 
all the part of north Œ northeast part of 
Poland
 that™s 
Lithuania
 nowadays. They  
were trying to save their people from th
e Polish tyranny. So
 the borders were 
moving and then we sometimes laughed th
at we have Po les with so many German 
names, and we have Germans with the Po lish names. 
Q: It got all mixed. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: It got all mixed, and Œ thr
ough all of these chess players Œ 
A: Yes.

A: Okay . 
Q: Let™s go back again. In the Œ at Œ I wa
nted to find out mo re 
about your families™ 
histories. That is, what kind of a family 
did your father co me 
from, and thatyour 
mother came from? 

A: They were, let™s say  Father, his brot
her owned a larger piece of land near 
Kielce
. 
And Mother was living in that 
area, before they moved into 
Warsaw
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So they were rather the ag
ricultural, farmer Œ farmers. 
Q: Farm people. 
A: Yes. And when th ey lived in  
Warsaw
, they ch anged thei
r style completely. 
Q: Oh, did they? 

A: Yes, because you know, as they came 
from the smaller Œ smaller places, into big 
city like this. So this
 was a major change Œ 

Q: Did they feel Œ 
A: Œ in their style of life. 
Q: Did they feel Œ were they comfortable in 
Warsaw
 Œ 
A: Oh yes, yes. 
Q: Œ did they feel good Œ

A: Sister, for instance Œ we di Œ we were 
not rich, but we were pretty well-to-do, 
and Sister was going to  ballet school. I wa
s going to the normal public school, but 
later on, during the occupation, they  had 
to dish out money so I could go to th e 
secondary  school, unofficial Œ 
Q: Yes. 

A: Œ secondary schools. And th e sister 
was mucholder than
 I am, so she was 
continuing that Œ let™s say mu
sical education that she wanted to finish, but that was 
very difficult. Difficu
lt because living conditions were very Œ 
Q: Hard. 

A: Living conditions were rough, very rou
gh. People were rather concerned how to 
survive from day to day. They co
uldn™t have any plans at all. 
Q: Yeah. You Œ 

A: I reme mber as a kid I used to say goodbye to my  parents going to school, 

because I didn™t know whether I Œ I am gonn
a come back, you kn
ow, in peace. So 
city was living in a very, how shall I say,
 warlike atmosphere. Strit Œ streets were 
not safe. Streetcars were Œ very often str
eet was blocked, and 
people were taken by 
force into the Œ the trucks, a
nd put into the camp to be se
nt to work in Œ in Œ in 
Germany
. Slave laborers.  

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

Q: So, it just Œ you wouldn™t know, when you
 were on the streetcar, whether or not 
you™ll make your destination. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Is that what you™re saying? 
A: Yes. Nervousness. Nervousness was 
a controlled Œ a very rude way by th e 
Germans. At the beginning Œ that was Œ I™m 
speaking of 1940, very rough winter in 

Warsaw
, because it was very cold, and then
 ™42 Œ ™42, ™41 Œ ™42, when the 
separation of the population was getting to  
the point that they 
build the ghetto, and 
they separated Aryan population from the 
Jewish population. And then  ™43, the 
conditions started changing where 
that German behavior, after 
Korksk
(ph) and 
Stalingrad
 changed their attitude. They sort 
of mellowed down, you know, that™s Œ 
that greeting of 
high
 
Hitler
, with the hand raised very 
high, changed a little b it like, 
just in case we lose, 
high
 
Hitler 
with the little Œ smaller Œ sm
aller gesture. We were 
laughing, and Œ but we sensed that was a c
ity that was witnessing the change in the 
German attitude.
 Stalingrad
 was a major Œ major change
 in the German bravura, 
the German spirit of vic-victory for any cost. 

Q: So, I™ll ask one question about this, and 
then I want to go b
ack still, to pre-war. 
Did people know about German losses in 
Stalingrad
? I mean, after all, they 
contro lled the media. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

A: Oh yes, yes, they Œ let™s say, the Ge
rman propaganda was ve
ry strong 
wh en  th e 
Operation 
Barb arossa
 starts. You know, they  named Œ the code name 
Barbarossa
 
was the time when th
e Germans attacked 
Russia
. This was a sh Œ shock.  
Q: So you mean June 21
st
? 
A: I am saying June 21
st
, I think, 1941. Am I correct? 
Q: Yes. 
A: Yeah, ™41. And th -the Op eration 
Barbarossa
 was observed by us very closely. I 
was already a part of the Œ 

Q: Don™t talk about that, just about Œ I Œ 
wh at I wanted to know ab out is, how mu ch 
did people know about the Battle of 
Stalingrad
 in ™43? 
A: 
Stalingrad
. Let™s say, we drew conclusions 
what was happening in the eastern 
front, wh en we saw trains going through 
Warsaw
 with the German sol Œ German 
soldiers, you know, that no ears, no noses, 
no hands, because of the frostbites, from 
that famous Russian general. You know 
the fis Œ famous Russian general? What 
was his name?  

Q: General Œ General 
Winter

A: And we were witnessing, 
plus the Germans themselves 
were telling th ese stories, 
and somehow th e rumo r was spreading ou
t among Œ and then we had envoys from 
the Polish Home Army  that were going so
metimes eastb ound. A
nd they knew what 
was happening. Plus, we were getting th e news from the 
BBC
. 
Q: That™s interesting. 
A: See, the radios were confiscated. All 
radios were confiscated when the Germans 
entered. But we were smart enough 
not to give all the radios away. 
Q: Did your fami ly have a radio? 

A: Oh yes, before the war we had a radio,
 because Mama, as I 
said , my  mo th er was 
running that little cafeteria fo
r the radio producer. Radio 
Unio n

Q: Oh, so sh e wasn™t work
ing for the same organizati
on as your father, she was

A: Œ my sister and I.  
Q: Okay . Ok ay, so before the war, you had a radio. 

A: We had the radio, we had telephon
e. That was not the modern, you know, 
iPhone
 like we have here. That was on the wall,
 with that little receiver that you are 
putting in, the dial Œ 

Q: You mean, your phone Œ your phone wasn
™t a map service, and wasn™t a laundry 
service, and wasn™t a camera as well, like the 
iPhone
 is? 
A: No. No, we could call, let™s say, the op
erator for a weather report, or things like 
that, but that was the long way. 

Q: That™s right. So  Œ so you had a phone,
 you had a radio. Di
d your parents own an 
automobile? 
A: Let™s say, that was time when we had 
a couple cars that we rented for taxi. 
Q: Oh. 
A: For taxi, you know. So later on, when

Q: So you rent Œ your family rented car
s out and used them as taxis to make 
money? Is this what there was Œ 
A: No, it™s a Œ when that firm actu ally wa
s very close to Œ to bankruptcy, you know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Father received this, I should say, a pr
emium, like, that were two cars that he 
repaired, and then he rented out to 
the guys that were taxi drivers. 
Q: Oh, and so he got some Œ some 
Œ he got some percentage of that. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: I see. So the firm th at he was work
ing in, which was Œ tell me ag ain, it was Œ 
A: First 
Galena
(ph) 
Sa mo cho dowa
. 
Q: And that was to do 
parts for buses, right? 
A: Yes. 

Q: To buy parts for Œ 

A: These were Œ these were 
the intercity buses. Not like a 
Grey ho und
, or Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Much smaller, but they were going fro
m city to city, alongside the railroads. 
Q: And did that Œ did th at comp an
y go bankrupt before the war? 
A: No, no, this lasted til 193
9. Actually, some of the buse
s, some of the cars were 
requisitioned by the army wh
en the war starte d in 1939.

Q: Okay . 
A: I remember a visit of some high ranki
ng officers that came
 over, and th ey were 
discussing what cars can be used  by th e army. 
Q: The Polish army. 
A: Polish army , yes. 

Q: Okay . Okay, now I want to
 turn  to another subject; again, befo re the war. What 
were the kinds of conversations that you 
would have around th e dinner table with 
your family? Did you talk about po
litical events, and political things? 
A: Say Poles all together, they have, let™s 
say, great interest in Œ in politics. And 
especially since 
Poland
 was exposed to all different
, let™s say pressures from the 
west, from the east. Discussions at the tabl
e, and friends of my father came over. 
They were officers from the 
Œ active officers from the 
Œ from the Polish army. They 
discuss at the table the issues of 
Poland 
being such a strong coun
try, that they Œ the 
Germans will attack 
Poland
, we will resist, and then so 
on, and so on. So the talks 
were on the subject of milita
ry efforts, and Œ an-and 
Euro pe
 at that time was sort of 
sensing oncoming second Worl
d War. So these discussions
, I remember that the 
father was discussing th is. But when we ha
d gatherings that my  mo ther™s brother 
co min g  from 
Otwock
 for Œ sometimes for a weekends
, or summertime, so we were 
going th ere, discussions were different, 
you know. Ou r schooling time, and then

changes in the economy th
at were improving little by 
little; because you know, 
country was actually devastated during the 
first World War, and the oppressors, the 
occupiers, they Œ they  were taking their 
share. So we could not develop, just like 
western 
Europe 
developed free, and th at mo mentum
 that they had could not be, 
let™s say, shown in the Polish economy. 
Q: Well, here™s a question that™s a bit provo
cative, and I know in advance that it is. 
But there is the image, that
 when the war started, and 
Germany
 crossed the border 
into 
Poland
 with tanks, they were met by cavalry officers on horses and swords. 
A: This is Œ actually, this was a false st
ory. Some of the big cavalry units were 
surrounded by the German, let™
s say motorized units. And wh
en they lock
ed in, they 
tried to escape, but they were not, let™s sa
y, cr azy enough to att
ack with the lances 
against the German tanks, no. 

Q: Okay. I mean Œ 
I-I mean more that 
Poland
 was so unprep ared th at it didn™t have 
tanks of its own, that it didn™t have modern 
military equipment. Is that so, or is that 
a falsehood? 

A: That™s falsehood. We had air force. 

Q: Okay . 
A: That™s a Œ not as modern as th
e Germans had, but very effective. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

42
A: We had our own design, let™s say 
WSK Kalisz
 and that 
PZL
-
11
. These airplanes 
were not large in numbers, because 
this was a developing industry in 
Poland
, the 
aircraft industry. The tanks
, they were not built in 
Poland
, but we had tanks vic Œ 
Vickers 
tanks from Œ imported from 
England
. And we had the mo to rized units. We 
had the motorized brigade th
at actually later on, becam
e the first armored division 

in the west, under General 
Maczek
, af you Œ if you heard. 
Q: Uh-huh. Okay . 
A: And when Œ when  
Poland
 army was formed, let™s say we had so much 
experience with the enemies that the army
 was indoctrinated well enough to be 
spiritually strong. Equipment-wise, we 
were inferiors to Germans. We were 
inferiors Œ spirit of fighting was much 
stronger maybe that the Germans had. 
Q: So the morale was high. 
A: Morality of the army was high, morale 
was high, but the equipment was inferior, 
inferior. But very effective. Because 
remember, when the Œ when the Germans 
attacked us from three di
rections, actually; from 
East Prussia
, going south; from 
the 
Reich
, they were going east, and from the 
south, they were attacked through Œ 
Czechoslovakia
 was already annexed by th e Œ by the 
Reich
, by the 
Germany
. 
Q: Mm-hm. Right. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
43
A: And at that time also 
Slovakia
 joined the Germ
an camp. So we had some Œ part 
of the invasion of ch Œ Slovaks into  
Poland
, the German armies, and then armies 
from the 
East Prussia
 that was coming in. 
Q: And that was all September 1
st
, 1939? 
A: Yes, September 1939. So, 
wi Œ most of our defenses were directed against the 
Germans coming from the west
. We did not expect the Ru
ssians will stab us in the 
back on th e 17
th
 of September. They attacked to 
come and free their people that 
were living in 
Kresy
, which was the 
Volh ynia
, 
Polesie
, 
Podo le
,
 
and the 
Nowogródek
, closer to 
Lithuania
, as we were. So 
Kresy
 were liberated, quotation 
marks, by the Œ by th e Russians. 
Q: So th ere was no knowledge of the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
 in 
Poland
? 
A: In 
Poland
? 
Q: Yes. 
A: Yes, there was knowledge, yes, we knew, we knew ab out it, yes. 
Q: At the time? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Because it was signed one week before the war started.

A: Yes, but we knew it. Do
n™t forget that the Polish 
dwika
(ph), which was the, let™s 
say, compared to Œ to 
FBI
 or 
CIA
, the Secret Service, a
nd so on, we had a very 
good sensors everywhere in Œ in Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ in 
Prussia
 and in Œ in 
Germany
, especially in 
Berlin
. And Œ 
Q: So you had intelligence reports, the 
con Œ the government had intelligence 
reports. 
A: Oh yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Okay . But then Œ 

A: And these were prior to the Œ prior to 
the outbreak of the war. We were pretty 
well advanced in decoding German messages. ﬁ
Enigma
ﬂ is Œ that™s the movie 
nowadays Œ 

Q: Uh-huh, right.  

A: Œ going on, I don™t know if you see it. 
I didn™t see it, but I would like to see it, 
because there was a great contribution to th
e victory of the allie
d effort during the 
second World War, by giving 
the Œ giving the English a
nd French  the secrets of 
enigma. What was started was the getting in
, was the mathematical
 school that the 
Poles attended in 1932. And 
the connections that the 
Germany
 had with 
Ea st 
Prussia
 was via the enigma. They were sending codes, and all different secret

information. So the Poles star
ted getting interest in it, an d 
Zygalski
, 
Rafski
(ph), 
and there was a third name that I forgot, bu
t the Œ these were the three codebreakers, 
later on that they work for 
the Polish secret service. 
And this was in July 1939, 
when from 
England
, 
Poland
 signed the ag reement to be defended by 
England
 and 
France
, in case that we get attacked by th
e Germans. But anyway , going back  to 
that point that the British paid a visit to 
Poland
, 
Pery
(ph)
 
was the name of the town 
in the suburb of
 Wa rsaw
. Poles had copied two machines that were intercepted. 
When they send this to 
East Prussia
, it went via 
Warsaw
. So the secret service 
took the machines, dismembered them, 
photographed th em, do everything possible 
to reproduce the machines. And some of th
e copies were so identical that the 
Germans wouldn™t be able to recognize wh ic
h is the original, wh ich is the copy.  

Q: Oh, so th en you started fueling disinformation? 

A: Yeah, so when they
 came over, the British, 
Knox
 and 
Denniston
, I think, they 
were two gentlemen, and th e Frenchman, 
Bernard
, Colonel 
Bernard
 came over, 
and they were actually exch
anging their accomp lishment that field of cryptology, 
with the Poles. And they were very surp
rised when the Poles 
simply showed them 
that, we have two gifts from yo
u. One machine for the British, 
M Œ M Œ MI-6
, I 
believe, and the French secret 
Œ military secret to Colonel 
Bernard
.  
Q: So th ey gave 
these two enigma Œ

A: Enigmas to our allies. 
Q: I see. O k ay, this show
s how mu ch you know ab out 
Œ I mean, very few people 
know the detail of this Œ these sorts 
of events. But wh en I asked of the 
Mo lo tov -
Ribbentrop Pact
, and did people know about it, I Œ 
I need to be mo re precise. Did 
the man on the street k n ow about it, or
 did the government know about it? 
A: I™d say, speaking of govern
ment, Polish govern ment, when  
Poland
 was attacked, 
escaped, with a lot of trained personnel; 
most of the Polish airmen went through 
Romania 
Œ 
Romania 
was ally of 
Poland
 Œ and mo st of them escaped through 
Hungary 
an d
 Romania
 to the west. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So when the government left 
Poland
, ji Œ was General 
Rydz-
˛
mig
y
, and 
Mo
˚
cicki
 was the president. 
Mo
˚
cicki 
was a ctually a Œ a s Œ a Swiss. He was 
educated in 
Switzerland
 and so on. But anyw
ay, when they left, 
the official, legal 
Polish government was formed in 
France
. In exile, they Œ we called it. 
Q: Of course. 
A: So th rough th at government, and the 
connections of the Polish underground, and 
the government in 
France
, and later on wh en 
France
 was defeated, they moved to 
London
. And then came picture of President 
Raczkiewicz
, if you know, and th en 
Siko rski
, General 
Siko rski
. He was a premier of the 
Polish government in exile. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015

Q: Okay . 
A: Through that government, and the co
nnections of Polish underg round, you 
know, there was an exchange of news, 
views, and interviews, whatever was 
happening in the west, 
and especially in the 
Germa ny
. You know, so Œ 
Q: So that Œ so Œ 

A: Œ so they  were well informed. The memb ers of the underg round in 
Poland
 was Œ 
were Œ were very well informed of 
what was behind th e screen going on. 
Q: All right. What about people like y
our family, like your neighbors. Did you 
know of Œ of Œ were Œ were Œ was the regular person in 
Warsaw
 as well informed, 
or were they surprised? Because you 
see, when you say something like, the 
Soviet 
Unio n 
stabbed 
Poland
 in the back, that Œ that sugg
ests a surprise. And if you™re 
very well informed, you won™t be surprised. 

A: Let™s say, we had so many refugees in 
Wa rsa w
 during the war, as the Germans 
advanced from the west Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ toward 
Wa rsa w
. Eight Œ on the eighth day of op
erations, they were already at 
the gates of 
Warsaw
. So we had refugees co
ming from the west into 
Wa rsa w
, and 
we had refugees coming from the east into
 Warsaw
. So, this meltin g pot, this city,

the capital city was sort of a source of a
ll kind of gossip; good
 news, bad news. So 
the people were pretty well informed. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Even the Œ in the streets, average Po
le not maybe educated
 well enough, but still 
Œ 
Q: Knew  something. 

A: Œ people say. 
Q: People talk. 
A: And this was an exchange of news. Pl
us, you know, we had hidden radios, we 
were listening to the 
BBC
. 
Q: Okay. So now I™ve jump
ed ahead a little b it. I want
 to go back to the very 
beginning. Do you remem Œ th
e very beginning of the wa
r. Do you remember where 
you were on September 1
st
, 1939? 
A: September 1
st
, 1939, prior th e day to th at outbr
eak and attack by the Germans, I 
was walking with my sister toward the de
li store nearby, and we were talking about 
Œ because the Œ that was in th
e atmosphere that Poles Œ we 
are so strong that if they 
attacked us, the third day,
 our forces will be in 
Berlin
, you know. So I 
talked to my 
sister, I says, would you be Œ 
Helena
, would you be interested
 to Œ to Œ to see the

war, what it is like? A nd sh e says yes, it w
ill be very interesting. So, as kids, you 
know, young people, we were talking ab out the oncoming disaster. 
Q: And you were 10, and sh e was 14. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay. It™s Œ you were kids. 

A: Yes. The kids, but you kn
ow, th-th Œ th e kids, let™s sa
y, in Œ in Œ in adopted 
country, here in 
United States
, they are not as mature as the kids in Œ in Œ in  Œ 
living in the conditions, wa
rtime conditions. Kids matu
re fast. You know, when 
you™re in danger, y-you don
™t think about baseball, 
TV
 sets, and things at the time 
that was not existing. But we were serious
ly interested of what was going on. When  
I joined the undergro und Œ maybe
 that™s a su bject later o n  Œ 
Q: Yes. 

A: Œ this was 1940 Œ ™42, I was 
Œ I was what, 12 - 13 years old. 
Q: You were young. 
A: I was young. 
Q: You were young. You we
re young. Okay, so the 
day before, you remember 
going to  the deli with your sister. 
A: Yes. 
Q: What about the day itsel
f? When did you learn? 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
50
A: We learn the first, when we saw the 
German airplanes flying over, and the Po lish 
anti-aircraft artillery opened 
the full blast, whatever wa
s necessary to protect our 
skies, I saw  the dogfights of the Polish 
P-11
 fighter planes in the sky. The 
Messersch mitts
 were much faster, and they were 
metal planes. But the planes that 
Poland
 had, had a very 
[phone ringing][break] 
Q: So you Œ you saw the Po lish planes, yes. 

A: The Polish planes. The anti-aircraft 
Œ actually, there was a heavy machine gun 
position near that 
Clement™s
 church, in their garden, yo
u know, they  set up near the 
church , because you know, the religious Ge
rmans would not maybe mount an attack 
somewhat close to the chur
ch. But this Œ this post wa
s manned by the Œ by the 
Polish army, and the anti-airc
raft was very effective. 
Q: Were any of them shot down ? 

A: I saw, let™s say, smoke trails, three tim
es. One was, I think, Polish airplane, and 
then the two 
Messerschmitts 
went down. The conflict that lasted from first of 
September til sixth of October, the losses th
at the Germans suffered in the air force 
Œ they say that the Polish air force was 
grounded and non-exis
ting, on th e contrary. 
I have a book written by 
Becker
, a German writer, who said that first 16 days, there 
was a very effective strength of Po lish air 
force. Pilots were very well trained in 
D


blin
 air academy. And these pilots that 
were fighting in 
1939 over the Polish 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

51
skies, they escape through 
Romania
, through 
France
, to 
England
. And they were 
part of the Œ part of the battle Œ Battle of 
Britain
. 
Q: So, in  other word s, did they  become
 Œ did they set up the training for the 
RAF
 
pilots, and for Polish pilots over Œ over 
Germ any
? 
A: The 
RAF
, yes, that was the Œ 
Doen ing
(ph), General 
Doening
(ph), the head of 
the 
RAF
. He was very skeptical, because there 
was a language barrier, and actually, 
he finally, when  he saw wh at the damages the 
Luftwaffe
 did to the British, he 
decided to accept the Polish contingent of 
air pilots, and there were two squadrons 
formed. Three or two, and 
three or through Œ three. 
Ko
˚
ciuszko 
Squadron. I even 
have a poster that I can later on show you. These pilots Œ if you saw a movie, 
ﬁ
Battle of Britain
,ﬂ there were Poles, very brave,
 and we had the highest score, 
beating th e Germans on equal basis, you know, because 
Spitfires
 and 
Hurricanes
 
were equivalent to 
Messerschmitts
. Or 
Dornier
, or whatever they had, the 
bombing airplanes, the 
Heinkels
 and 
Dorniers
, and all the weapons that 
Goering 
provided for Œ for the Operation 
Sea Lion
, whatever it was, he wanted to put 
Britain 
on the Œ on her knees. And 
the fight was very, let™s say, effective. So the 
pilots, the pilots that left 
Poland
, they put their talent to action in 
Eng l and
, when 
they had better airplanes, but the spirit 
very strong. The Œ the British were a little 
skeptical, because of the language, and we 
were not so very obedient. We had our 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

52
style of fighting in the sky, and the guys 
really, when they atta
cked, th-th-the British 
squadron leader at that time, ther
e was a Canadian by the name of 
Kent
. He was 
trying to  control the disobedience of Po le, how to attack the Germans, but the 
results were rather Œ very effective. Realize that the Poles in 
England
, with 15 
squadrons, four bomber squadrons. We acc
ounted for almo st 1000 German planes 
shot in the air, th-the dogfights.
 On e thousand, that™s a big Œ 
Q: That™s a lot. 

A: Œ big score. 
Q: That™s a lot. 

A: The 303 was the 
Ko
˚
ciuszko
 Squadron. And why we named the 
Ko
˚
ciuszko
 
Squadron was the story of 
Ko
˚
ciuszko
 heard that we got as a rep Œ 
re-reprocity
. 
See, the 
Poland
 regained her independence, th anks to President 
Wilson
. And at that 
time Americans wanted  to pay the Œ pa
y the dues for Œ for fighting, for 
independence of 
Poland
 from the 
Bolsheviks
; this is the first World War. And 18 
American pilots, American
s, they formed the s
quadrons that fought the 
Bo lsheviks
. 
Q: Oh, really? 

A: And they  were the 
Ko
˚

Squadron. 
Q: Oh, I see.

like this, I show you later on Œ

A: Œ in that poster. But that was paid

contribution to the i

 that was, that died in

A: Œ let™s say Œ in eight Œ eight or nint
h of September, the German forces were 
surrounding the city. 
Warsaw
 was defending herself til the 28
th
 of September. No 
water, no ammunition, so that fo
rced us to Œ to surrender. 
Q: Okay, here™s my question, though: 
what was happening with your family? 
A: My family, okay. 
Q: I want to know what happened with you. 

A: This Œ we Œ on the 11
th

th
 of September, I saw  the Germans™ 
planes coming over and making some white 
streaks in t h e sky, and let™s say a few 

hours later, a heavy artille
ry bombardment started. 

Q: So you hadn't  heard any bombs 
before? No bombs were falling on 
Warsaw Œ 
A: No, th ere were bombs Œ bomb s bombing wa
s, but not the part that we lived in. 
Q: I see. 

A: That was the direct hit th
at they started attacking th e comp lex, because the repair 
shops of these transportation company,

Q: Okay . 
A: He was moved to  
Ch

as child going to that trade school, we 
had th e backpacks. We used to  use our

ered the streetcar that was going 
through that three blocks of both
 ghettoes, we used to empty our Œ

whatever food we could shar

couldn™t leave the streetcar, but you c
ould throw things out the window. 
A: Yes, yes, the Œ the police blew Œ po
licemen that were protecting people from

A: Before that, yeah, yeah. 
Q: And then, since Œ since the artillery fire
, and your bi Œ your home was destroyed, 
how many did he take
 in? New people? 
A: Oh, th e refugees? I would say ma Œ my  
family was there, and maybe some three 

or four other groups Œ families 
that were in that basement.  

Q: So you could have been
 about 40 people, or so? 
A: I would say, yeah Œ 
about that, yeah, yeah. 
Q: Okay . And you said you 
got to speak 
with him? 
A: Oh, he was Œ he was Œ he was deliv
ering the o Œ oatmeals, you know, I was 
exhausted from that fire and then  that 
shock from the artillery bombings, so I was 
sort of shaken up to the point that he ha
d to calm me down with Œ when ever he was 
bringing the hot oatmeal to me, he was al
mo st feeding me, so I could eat, you know. 
So, he was very soft. 

Q: Oh, really? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Did he say anything to you? 

A: Oh, he said, you look very
, very tired to me, you look 
very tired, so I have to 
help you to rebuild your strength. 

Q: That sounds great, very kind. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
64
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Because you know, during the siege of 
Warsaw
 that lasted 28 days, our fo od 
supplies were exhausted. The water was 
short, a shortage of water, and th e 
resistance was strong, very strong. We defended 
Wa rsa w
 for so long, and the 
Germans admired the Œ the knighthood of 
the Polish army that I™m after. Because 

de-defending 
Warsaw 
was a guy by the name of 
Rommel
, General 
Rommel
, the 
Polish side. I don™t know if there was any connection of that 
Erwin Rommel
 in 
Africa
, or 
Rommel 
Gen eral. 
Q: How interesting. 
A: Yeah, 
Ro mmel 
Œ 
Q: And how ironic. 
A: Yeah. 
Juliusz Rómmel
. An d there was another general, 
Czuma
, 
Czuma
, I think 
his son was here in 
Chicago 
for a while, but he returned to 
Poland
. 
Czuma
.

Q: So, where did you go after you were at
 this orphanage? You didn™t stay there 

forever? 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
65
A: On th e orphanage, what we did is
, portion of the building that was not 
comp letely damaged, so to speak of, so
 we covered the windows that were all 
broken, the floor, the doors. We tried to
 rebuild whatever space was available. 
Q: Did you return to 
your old ap artment? 
A: Ah, no, no, no. 
Q: No. 

A: Thi-This whole thing was collapsed. Th
e next Œ next possession, next building 
which I me ntioned to you, this was a portio
n of that was offices, portion were this 
mechanical shop, or textile shop and so me
 chemical stuff that they were doing 
upstairs. Portion of the offices we conv
erted to our, let™s say, primitive living 
quarters. No water. The windows we cove
red with whatever. We didn™t have 
plastic, but there was something very foggy 
that we covered too, because the winter 
of 1940 was so severe that Œ frost was so
 strong th at the pigeons were falling off the 
balconies. 
Q: Wow. 
A: Very severe winter, 
minus 40 centigrade, almo st. 
Q: That™s huge. 
A: Yes. 
Q: That™s huge, for a place that™s not that far north . 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
66
A: And there we was Œ we were Œ let™s sa
y, the Germans, when
 they entered the 
city, some of the squares they set 
up th e salamanders, you know, they were 
salamanders, they were like a coke ovens, a
nd they heated up so
 the people could Œ 
could warm themselves. And 
Weh r m a ch t
 at that time, they set up field kitchens Œ 
can you imagine, for the civilians. The 
Wehrmacht
 was behaving like a regular Œ 
regular army . No  Œ no behavior like the 
SS
, or Œ or Œ or the, let™s say gent Œ the Œ 
the field police. Later on when  the secondary  units came, the 
Wehrmacht
 left, you 
know, so there was a change in
 attitude toward the civilians. 
Q: So, you move back across the street, a
nd Œ and into  one of the offices that now 
you converted Œ 
A: I returned back to the next possession 
actually, that was ad
jacent to the area 
where we lived. After the fire, we rebuild 
it. I remember we had two rooms at the 
beginning, the whole family. And there was a fami ly by the name of 
Bront
(ph), 
Bront
(ph). I think that was a Œ a German
 citizen, and his wife was Polish, 
Behrowska
(ph), and they had a daughter, 
Danuta
(ph). And I think this family, 
because of the German root
s, they signed the volks Œ 
Vo lksli s te
. They sign up to be 
part of, let™s say that superior race. So th
ey lived in the two Œ 
they displaced us from 
the two ro oms, and they Œ we were move
d to the single room. Four people, single

room. So , they later on moved out from the 
area, into a special 
section of the city 
that was reserved for the Germans. 
Q: I see, I see. Did they have ch
ildren, or was this only a couple? 
A: They™re a couple, they had 
one child, there was Œ that was 
Danuta
(ph). And 
when  she came to visit us during th e o
ccupation, she was that hio Œ th e ha Œ 
Hitlerjugend
, but she was the 
mädel
, the Œ the Œ the Œ 
Q: Ah, 
Wundersdeutch en mädels
. 
A: Œ 
mä del
. 
Wundersdeutches mädel
. Yeah, she came in uniform, and we 
couldn™t talk too much to her, even tho
ugh they were Œ she was very  befriended 

with my sister, going to the ballet school together. 
Q: But things changed. 
A: It™s changed, yes. Now, I remember wh
en I walked in when 
they were occupying 
that two room apartm
ent, I remember the 
Griffarts
(ph) on the wall. You know the 
name 
Griffarts
(ph)?  
Q: No, what™s that? 

A: Oh, the German staff 
officers u sed to call 
Hitler Griffarts
(ph). 
Q: 
Griffarts

Q: And was it a term of respect and endearment? 
A: Well, you know, the 
Wehrmacht 
were Œ tha-that was endearment Œ I Œ I rather 
not, because later on 
Hitler
 acted like a strategist, because he had dreams, you 
know. So Œ so Œ 

Q: You mean, like dreams at night? 
A: At night, yeah Œ 
Q: Yes. 

A: Œ that he was trying to
 implement these dreams into the action, you know. 
Manstein
 Œ 
Ma n stein
, his numb er one strategist on 
the eastern front, he had to 
listen to the fuehrer, you know. So the 
officers among themselves, from time to 

time they used the name Œ 

Q: So th ey had a picture Œ okay, so
, in their apartmen
t, you Œ the Œ the 
Brandt
(ph)

pick up where we left off before the br
eak. And from what I remember, we were 
talking about the 
Volksdeutsche 
family neighbors that had been in  Œ near you, who 
displaced you from your ow n small quarters after the arsenal Œ the artillery bombs 

and shells of your own apar
tment, and had a picture of 
Hitler
 on their walls in their

, and their daughter belonged to the 
association of young German girls, and 
Œ and she no lo nger Œ she had been  a friend 

with your sister, but then 
they no longer could rea
lly be close after that. 
A: Superiority of race. This Œ the Œ 
they disconnected 
our good relations. 
Q: So how did your lives then Œ I mean
, they wer Œ ye Œ it was Œ your life was 
turned over because you lost
 your place to live, and 
Wa rsa w
 was now occupied by 
Œ by the German 
Wehrmacht
, and soon Œ how did things develop? 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

A: Let™s say the control of the city Œ I think that was a 
Fisher
, the Œ the governor of 
the city, because 
Frank
 was Œ 
Frank
 was in 
Kraków
. 
Kraków
 was the head Œ ci Œ 
the main city of 
GG
, govern ment gubern Œ 
Q: 
Gouvernement
? 
A: 
Gouvernement
, yeah.
 General na gubern ia
(ph) 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And 
Warsa w
 was a city of transit for the Ge
rmans to the eastern front, one of 
the cities. S o  the character of the city 
was changed. A lot of military uniforms 

we™ve seen in the streets ev
erywhere, that they were occu pying the best place to, 
let™s say, live and be treated. So mo st of
 the theaters, restaurants, were with the 
inscription, 
nur für Deutsche
, for Germans only. 
Q: I see. So Poles couldn™t go there. 

A: So streetcars, even streetcars, you know
, they had th e platform, front platform on 
the streetcar there was 
nur für Deutsche
, only for Germans. Sometimes when there 
were too many, let™s say, attacks on th e Ge
rmans, or too many of their side weapons 

disappeared , because in the crowd, th
e streetcar, many times, you know, the 
AK
 
were cutting their holsters, and stealing their 
weapons, and so  on, and so  on. So they 
were changing the platform, 
sometimes in front, sometimes
 in the back. But this 
was strictly for Germans. And a city, as 
such, you know, was divided for the Aryans 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

and the Jews. The ghetto was formed, the 
wall was built, and the minority of the 
Jews, which was the largest diaspora in th
e world; I think ma
ybe more than in 
New 
York
; so they were put into either smal
l ghetto, or large ghettos. A small ghetto 
actually, delicately speaking, was reserved for the well-to-do Œ 
Q: Oh really? 

A: Œ Jews. Yes. And the large ghetto wa
s Œ well, the Germans used the term 
lumpenproletariat
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Did you hear that one? 

Q: Yes. 
A: 
Lumpenproletariat
. So the poor Jews were
 in the large ghetto. 
Q: So Œ 
A: And, well, the annihilati
on of the Jewish race started right from the beginning, 
when they activated 
Treblinka
, which was the closest cr
ematorium, closest to 
Warsaw
. 
Q: So, there was a gas chambe
r as well as a crematorium? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Okay. I™d like to focus 
a little bit more precisely on 
what changes did you see, 
and what ch anges happened  within  your fa
mily? So let™s Œ le
t™s focus on that.

A: It™s Œ okay, my sister was working 
for a food Œ food Œ food factory, and my  
father, as I mentioned, because of his k
nowledge of German language, he was used 
as a interpreter.  
Q: When  you say your sister was work
ing for a food factory, was this now 
something under German control? 
A: Yes, yes. Most of the Polish industry
, which was in the city, and the workshops 
and the Œ all kind of places 
where they could use for 
the war machinery for the 
Third 
Reich
 Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ they immediately  activated
 that, an-and they were tryi
ng to give some kind of a 
priority to produce the mach
inery of war. Like for inst
ance, that building nearby, 
what we lived in, the section that there we
re offices converted to apartments. Now, 
this portion of the building, the Œ what 
was saved after the bombardment, they 
repaired whatever they coul
d, but the basement and th e 
first floor, what they were 
doing, th ey were building field kitchens, 
you know, just like 
the first World War, 
that was on wheels. All these containers 
and they were cookin
g the meals for the 
army. So Œ 
Q: Oh, I see. 
A: Yeah, so this was a place, pretty active. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

Q: So, it meant the equipment that Œ that
 cooked the food was being manufactured 
there. 
A: Manufactured there, yes, by the 
Po les. And th e production was for the 
Wehrmach t
. I reme mb er a visit one day that Œ I don™t know wh ether he was a 
Reichsdeutsche
 or 
Volksdeutsche
. I think he mu st have been 
Reichsdeutsche
 
because he had that Tyro
lean hat with the little Œ 
Q: Feather? 
A: Œ brush. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Feathers. And
 
he came over, visited. He came in a

, 
−koda
, that was 
Czech car, very nice car. And he in
spected the facilities, you know. 
Q: Was this a Œ a Œ a person in a uniform, or in civilian Œ 

A: No, he was a Œ a Œ a private Œ priv
ate Œ a civilian uniform, yeah, civilian 
uniform. 
Q: Uh-huh. So was the Œ so was the Œ wa
s this production f
acility owned by Œ beca 
Œ was it still private? In priv ate hands, but German hands? 
A: I would say yes. I didn™t see any in un
iform, any people in uniform. There was 
the guy that came over a couple times, you 
know, to insp ect the facility, and see

Q: Mm-hm. Did you know that Œ if
 he was a chief or something? 
A: I would say so, because he 
had that round sign Œ badge of 
Reichsdeutsche
 Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ you know, they  used to have these badges on their lap Œ 
Q: Lapel. 

A: Yeah, 
pa tel Œ
 yeah, that™s Œ it was 
Œ it Œ it looked like a 
Ebermensch
(ph). 
Q: An

, yeah. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Now, when you said that those apartmen
ts had been co nver Œ th ose offices were 
converted into apartments, and at first you 
had the two room one, and then  you were 
Œ your family was pushed ou
t into a one room, what ki
nd of kitchen facilities were 
there? 

A: You know, we Œ we sometimes improvise
d things as we need. So I rememb er 
my father built his own little oven, connected 
to the stack, to the chimney, and we 
were cooking right on two Œ two Œ let™s 
say two burners, not burn ers, but fire 
[indecipherable]
 wh at we had that was something,
 a hotplate like. So this was the 
part, and the sanitary facilities, th ey were
 using so me toilets that were left, you 
know, with Œ 

Q: From the office.

A: Yeah Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ of the office, so the primitive and very
 s-simple w ay, and th
e Œ the idea was to 
survive, so we did no
t complain too much. 
Q: What about taking a bath? 

A: Heating Œ hm? 

Q: What about taking a bath, and heati
ng? How did you handle those things? 
A: This Œ heating, we were
 boiling the water, you know Œ 
Q: Sure. 

A: Œ in that little stove that we had. The wa
shing facilities, there used to be a public 
Œ the public shower stations in 
the city, so we 
utilized these. 
Q: I see. 

A: But then we were heating the water in
 some tub, you know, and then washing 
ourselves the best we could. 
Q: Okay . 
A: There was a lack of everything, yo
u know. Soap  was scarcity, paper was a 
scarcity. Bread tha-that was 
made for the Poles. Sometimes
 we were laughing that 
that bread was just like a Œ 
like a Œ like a board, not properly baked in the Œ in  Œ in Œ 
in enough time to mak e it edible, t o  make 
it e d ible. They didn™t use the flour, they

used the sawdust underneath in the ovens, 
you know, so Œ so this was a substitute. 
Everything was ersatz. 
Q: Substitute, yes. 
A: Substitute. Ersatz. That™s a Œ the bread
, the basic stuff, staple. T h e marmalade 
was made out of beets, sweetened up with
 saccharin. You know, it was the artificial 
sweetener. And that thing, you could eat as
 mu ch as you wanted, but the next day 
the thing was fermented and was growing. You always had a full Œ full jar. So meat 

was only on the black market Œ black ma
rket, you know, so the ingenious Po les 
were going to the countryside to bring fo od
. The Germans intercepted Œ most of the 
railroad stations they were 
intercepting in order to take
 that food away from them. 
But food; meat, butter, you know, these we
re things very difficult to obtain. 
Q: And they were forbidden? 

A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Schwarzm arkt
 is what they call it, th
e black market, was a no-no. 
Q: Well, here™s Œ 
A: The Germans were setting up patrols and 
Œ and Œ and stopping the trains before 
this destination, and Œ and 
Œ and getting the people, sorting th em out, and checking 
what kind of food
 they bringing. 
Q: Okay. I want to just ma
ke sure that I understand it 
properly. There was rationing, 
yes?

A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: There was rationing. We Œ 
Q: And there was rationing so that you co
uld get only a certain 
amount of any kind 
of food, but was it actu ally so that cert
ain foods were forbid
den to  even have, 
whether the e Œ for example, if it™s eggs
, or butter, or meat. I-Is it that it™s not 
forbidden if you have it in your home, that 
it™s forbidden to bring it there? Ho-How 
did that work? 
A: Let™s see, it was forbidden to Œ meat, 
especially meat, you 
know. But eggs you 
could buy on the bla Œ black market; fl
our and butter, you know. Wh atever the 
people could smuggle in from the countrysid
e, that was done. Bu t not all these, let™s 
say attempts, were successful. The Germ
ans were intercepting and taking away 
from the people. 

Q: Okay . So Œ 
A: So even they joked that
 someti mes a s Œ a pig was sm
uggled into the city. But 
how it was smuggled? Because it was dresse
d up in a human su
it, you know, where 
the snout was all covered up
 with bandages, you know, and th e Œ th-they Œ th e 
German patrol was told that 
this was a sick man going to

hospital; 
suddenly there was a pig. Women were Œ

Q: Was that actually true? 
A: Yes, yes. There were many, ma ny differe
nt ways of how to outwit the Germans, 
for the sake of survival. Things were very
 risky, but still they
 had to be played. 
Q: So you are at Œ in 1939,
 you™re a 10 year old boy. 
A: Yes. 

Q: You go through the 
winter of 1940, and di Œ did 
your sister and yourself ever 
refer to that conversation that
 you had about gee, it would be interesting to see what 
war was like, after you actually felt it? 

A: Yes, many a times said now, we are ex
periencing th is unfortunate exchange of 
thoughts that we had just before the war 
started. Because the occupation was cruel, 
very cruel. And we were treated as sub-humans.  
Q: Did you Œ how did you 
personally experience that kind of treatment? 
A: How did I experience that kind of treatme
n t? First, as I said, the streetcars were 
separated for Germans, and for the Poles. 
Q: Right. 
A: The s Œ on th e sidewalks very often, we
 had to leave room as the Germans were 
passing by for them. And th e lin
es for food in our, let™s 
say, stores, were long, 
people were waiting, sometimes for noth
ing. The German stores, there was a 
company my Œ 
Mynell
(ph) Œ 
My nell
(ph), that was for Germans, where they could

buy anything th ey wanted; butter, eggs, me
at. Everything just for the Germans, 
separated from the Polish. 
Q: Were there German civilians? 
A: Yes. During the heavy bomb ing of 
Reich
, th e Œ  
Germ any
 wen Œ was bomb ed. 
Many Germans, to sa ve th
eir lives, they were moving. Let™s say memb ers of the 
families, th ey were moving into 
Warsaw
 to live, and certain parts of the city were 
reserved for a German population. Th
e better sides, undestroyed, and Œ was 
provided for the 
German families, 
Reichsdeutsche
 that came from the Œ from the 
Reich
. 
Q: So, does that mean toward s Œ clo Œ clos
er toward s the second part of the war? If 
you™re saying it™s when  
Germany
 itself was being bomb ed, or Œ 
A: Well, the mass Œ mass bombing, you 
know, it started where the Americans 
declared war, when was this, 19 Œ 
Q: Forty-four, so that™s late. 
A: Forty-three, I believed it. 
Q: No, the Americans started in Œ June 6
th
, 1944 was the invasion of

A: And Œ and th e Œ 
Harris
, what they call General 
Harris
, the bomber Œ there™s a

London
 of

. 
Q: Well, but my point is Œ my Œ my question is, did these civilians, were they were 
from the very beginning Œ 
A: No, no. 

Q: Œ in 
Warsa w
? They appeared later? 
A: No, they appeared later. 

Q: Okay . 

A: Later, yes. 

Q: So, in the beginning the Germans that
 you saw were military people, were all 
somehow or other connected with the war effort? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Okay. Did you see any Œ you mentioned 
during the shelling of the artillery, when 
the factory that Œ in your home was Œ was 
destroyed, that people died, were killed 

as a result of this artillery fire.

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Did you ever see anybo
dy el Œ did you ever see a
nybody treated violently on the 
street? Did you ever see any corpses on the roads? 
A: No, not violently in the street, there wa
s no scene like this. 
But there were times 
where the Germans, let™s say, separated cert
ain parts of the street, or streetcars that 
were in, in order to kidnap 
the people for 
work in the 
Reich
. So these things were 
very frequent. 

Q: And you saw these things. 
A: Yes, I was part of it. That™s a scene 
that I remember. One of
 my  colleagues, he 
had a pistol on him, and wh en th e Germans 
stopped, you know, he was so upset that 
he started sweating, you know. And there wa
s an older lady, say 80 - 85, she look at 
that young fellow, and she open her pur
se, you know. So he put the gun Œ 
Q: In her purse. 

A: Œ into  her purse, she close it. The Ge
rmans didn™t attack her, you know, didn™t 
question her at all. And the boys Œ 

Q: But they searched him. 

A: Œ he save his Œ she saved his life. And 
Œ and th e spirit, and Œ an d the brotherhood 
among th e Poles in 
Wa rsa w
 was unusually unique and 
Œ and good, from the sense

that we stood fo r each other until the end. 
And we knew that th
e end is coming for 
all of us, one way or the other, so we stuck together. There was a Œ 
Q: And that™s Œ that™s unusual. 
A: Yeah. For 
[indecipherable] 
yes, yes. There were Œ there were cases, you know, 
like 
schmeil
(ph) 
shovnik
(ph), you heard that expression? 
Q: Tell me what this is. 
A: 
Schmeil
(ph) 
shovnik
(ph) were the people that, for 
instance, when the Jews were 
vacating some areas in 
Warsaw
, these guys were sort of acting against them. 
Q: How? 

A: Anti-Semitism, by e-even Œ even in th
e cemetery, you know, when they saw the 
buried bodies, you know, so they
 were hunting fo r people bur
ied, fo r gold teeth, and 
things like that. 

Q: So they were Œ they were actually going
 through corpses to be able to rob them 
of whatever Œ 
A: Yes. These were cases, yes. A nd th-t
he underg round government, when  they saw 
certain peoples, the squealers, or some 
informers, they used
 to issue the death 
sentences, and 
AK
 was executing these people. 
Q: Now, you Œ you Œ 
did you know all this as that 
10 or 12 year ol
d boy, walking

A: I was a memb er Œ  o k ay , I was a me mb e
r, I joined the unde
rground when I was 
12. In  1942, I was sworn in in 
Schweidel
, the suburb, you know
, very nice forest 
there. I was sworn in into 
paramilitary organization, wh ich was Œ pre-war, it was the 
Boy Scout movement. 
Q: So tell me how did that happen? Di
d you find them, or 
did they find you? 
A: No, th ey found me, I think. I had two good teachers, you know. 
Ca simira
(p h) 
Bye
(ph) and 
Janina
(ph )  
Guretsky
(ph). They were observing me at school, and my 
behavior, and th e way they trusted me. And 
there was a third teacher, that was Mrs. 
Bernisz
(ph). She was of German descent. And th
ey accosted me, an d they ask me if 
I would be interested to wo
rk in the undergro
und. So, I sign up, I was sworn in in 
1942, and the rest of the years of occupa
tion, I was a member of the Home Army, 
Polish Home Army, with the sign o
f, as you can see, that anchor,

Q: Did your parents know 
any of what you were going
 to be doing, or Œ or Œ 
A: Especially when I was coming Œ yo

eight o™clock. 

Q: Curfew. 

A: Curfew, yes, that people stopped in th
e street without proper docu ments, they 
were arrested, and if they di
dn™t respond to, let™s say a 
[indeciphera ble]
 they were 
shot. After many a times, I was coming ho
me, and there was a discussion, you 
know, and finally they gave
 up, you know, because I c
ouldn™t do Œ they couldn™t 
punish me anymore. So  I was disappearin
g fo r late hours to do my  duties, which 
were Œ

A: Yes. 
Q: And they  would say Œ 
A: Where were you? 

Q: Œ wh ere were you? And di
d they  Œ did you tell them? 
A: They sensed something, ye
s, they did sense something,
 that I was doing all kind 
of things that would 
be penalized by death. 
Q: And did they ever address those risks? 

A: The way Œ the way we lived, and th e feel
ing we had toward  the occupiers, they 
did not forbade my  activity, no. 
Q: Your mo ther Œ you said your father
 was working as an interpreter at the 
Ostbahn

A: Yes. 
Q: Now, what was your mother doing, 
was she ki Œ still in that cafeteria? 
A: Sh Œ no, no, there was no mo re of Œ that
 was burned out place, and she was just a 
housewife, you know, fighting 
to prepare a meal for us.

87
Q: Yeah, not easy. 
A: Whatever was available. 

Q: What did you usually eat? 
A: Oh, let™s say, for school, sandwich. We 
had that Œ that bread, wh ich we called 
sort of a Œ like a pumpernickel bread. Two 
slices that were soaked in artificial 
coffee made out of grain, regul
ar grain. Pu t some sugar on 
top of it, put these things 
together, and that was my  sandwich for school. 

Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: Or, sometimes the onion that was fried in
 some schmaltz, lard, and this was sort 
of a spread Œ 
Q: Onto  the Œ 
A: Œ for the sandwich. Meat was a scarci
ty, scarcity. And let™
s say someti mes th e 
Ostbahn
, they had the cafeteria
s where mymoth
er could get the soup for us. 
Q: So your father wo
uld bring it back, or Œ 
A: No, my mother used
 to walk to there and she had 
the document that she was wife 
of the employee of the 
Ostbahn
, and sh e was bringing the soup home. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But I™m speaking of soup. 
Q: I know. I know. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
88
A: But the pota Œ piece of potato was a su
rprise. And piece of meat, you know, 
unseen. So this was a starvation diet. 
Q: And you said your sister work
ed in a food production factory Œ 
A: Yes, be Œ 

Q: Œ or place, or something. 
So what was that all about? 
A: The food was actually for 
us, for the Poles. That was 
not fo r the production, for 
the Germans, was strictly contro lled by Œ 
by the Germans, you kn
ow, so they Œ they 
were very careful. Let™s say they were 
confiscating the cattle and the Œ and all the 
things, but the processing of 
that was made by Œ by th em. 
Q: Okay. So, your sister worked. Wh
at kind of food wa
s she producing? 
A: I think this was like marmalades, and a
ll kind of preserves, fruit preserves. No Œ 
other, let™s say preserves. They were Œ ma
de, you know, pickling the cucumb ers, or 
Œ or pickles. And that was the simpl Œ 
simp le Œ simp le food like th is, you know. 

Q: And did she ever br
ing any of that home? 
A: Oh, she Œ they put 
that was that, let™s say, instea
d of payment, you know, they  
used to give something for the employees. Li
ke my  father used to get the alcohol, or 
coal Œ coal for burning in 
the stove. Or sometimes he was getting a Œ a bread, or 
mar-margarine. Artificial butter. So these 
things that he could get from the Œ from 
his superiors, you know.

January 27, 2015

Q: So, in stead of Œ in stead of mo ney, sometimes his Œ he was paid in Œ 
A: That was like a premium. Sort of 
a supplement to Œ 
to Œ to Œ to Œ 
Q: To the salary. 
A: Œ to mediocre salaries. Because this
 money what the Germans issued had no 
purch asing power. 
Q: Ah. 

A: Like for instance, if you went for the 
black market to buy f
ood in the country. 
The farmers used to accept only the pre-war 
money, which was silver coins. Silver 

coins, you know, the tens 
z
otys
, five 
z
otys
, two 
z
otys
. They were silver. I-I think 
at about 60 or 70 percen t pure silver. So 
they knew the metal value, and they  were 
selling food for this kind of bouillon. 

Q: I see. Rather Œ and rather than the Œ 

A: Than accepting th e paper money issued
 by the Germans, which had no Œ it was 
good for the 
General na gubernia
(ph) to Œ to Œ to buy so me stuff on the black 
market, but the farmers, they were ve
ry skeptical about the paper money. 
Q: Okay . 
Kry sty na

herself, w as she involved in any underground activities? 
A: Who? 
Q: Your sister.

A: My sister? I Œ she knew something about 
it. Very often, you know, th Œ sh-she 
didn™t show up on time home, it seemed 
to me, but everything was enveloped in 
secrecy. We couldn™t operate with 
the names, we were using only 
nom de guerre
. 
Q: Mm-hm, what was yours? 
A: 
Tabacca
(ph). 
Q: So your pseudonym was 
Tabacca
(ph)? 
A: 
Tabacca
(ph). And then wh en  there was some kind of a 
[indecipherable]
 which 
we used to call when the Germans discovere
d some Œ somebody that was squealing, 
and we were in danger of bein
g discovered, I was changed to

Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
91
Q: Yeah. So, your father worked there, yo
ur sister worked in the food production 
place, your mother stayed at home and tr
ied to find some way of making meals. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did your father ever t-tell st
ories of what he would see at the 
Ostbahn
? What 
kind of things he would be translating? 
A: When  Œ he often told  me about the Ge
rman trains coming from the eastern front. 

He said that he saw some kwerp Œ corp
ses. I mean, the people without legs, you 
know, frozen noses, ears. Bu
t they were running through  the tracks that were 
separated by some kind of partition, so th
e civilians wouldn™t see them. But he said 
that casualties were coming from the eastern front, yes. 
Q: So he could see these thi
ngs and he talked about them? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. And did he wo rk with one particular
 German if Œ in Œ official in particular, 

or with many? 
A: I think with many, because the administ
ration of the railroad was in many hands, 
you know, but the ch ief honcho
, I don™t even  know who Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ who Œ who that guy was. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

Q: And what would be the sort of things 
Œ he Œ was he a sort of like an in Œ in  
between the Œ the German bosses and th
e other workers? Is this where his 
translation skills were used, for them to 
translate orders? Or was it in different 
capacities? 

A: He was translating because there we
re many Poles employe
d that didn™t speak 
German. But the work assignments that we
re, let™s say, by th e Germans to direct 

certain squads of people to do this kind of work, 
[indecipherable]
 repairs, or the Œ 
what they call, the platform repairs, or 
Œ or is Œ cleaning up th e stations, you know. 
So he was always called in as a interpreter. 

Q: And do you think th at he
 might have been involved  in underground wo rk ? 
A: I Œ I don™t think so. Maybe he was acco
sted by some people, but I don™t think 
that he was Œ he was aware of that I was 
doing, toward  the end, but I don™t think he 
was part of it. He, let™s say, cooperated, if
 ther e was some  assignment to report, yes. 
But I don™t think that he was fully sworn 
in, an-and Œ and Œ an
d working for the Œ 
for the underground. Let™s say Poles were
 all memb ers of the underg round. We 
were all, let™s say, sympathetic to the 
people that were actually the activists, you 
know, and the civilians were cooperati
ng every time there was a situ ation, a 
dangerous situation, 
so they did help. 
Q: Like the lady who opened  her purse for the gun.

A: Yeah, yeah. They say with 
that inscription, and I said 
nur für Deutsche
, we 
played th e joke on Germans, because somehow the 
buchhandlung
, there was some 
Œ 
Q: A bookstore. 
A: Œ bookstore, in the German part of the ci-city, we bought a lot of these 
opaski
, 
what was this? Armbands. 

Q: The armbands, mm-hm. 
A: Armbands, 
nur für Deutsche
, you know. And then  we 
started putting in on th e 
lampposts, telegraph posts, everything th
at was vertically up, you know, we put 
these things around, 
nur für Deutsche
. And they caught that
 thing after a while, 
and that was repercussions. 
Q: Oh, really? 

A: Just like repercussions was Œ the Ge
rmans used the sign of victory. The 

Pilsudski
 square in center of 
Warsaw
, that™s where the tomb
 of unknown soldier is 
located. It still exists, partially, the uprisin
g Œ survived the siege of 1939. There are 
only three or four column s. If you™ve been in  
Warsaw
, maybe you saw it, the tomb  
of unknown soldier. 
Anyway, this was 
Pilsudski
 square. When 
Hitler 
came to 
Warsaw
 for the victory parade, as a gift they changed the name of many streets to 
German sounding names, 
and this was changed to 
Adolf Hitlerplatz
. And in front

 monument, they put a big sign of
 Victoria, and that victory sign 
underneath was 
Deutschland siegt am allen fronten
. 
Q: Okay , 
Germany
 is victorious on all fronts. 
A: On all the fronts. The word 
siegt
, we changed 
S 
to 
L
, and the so s Œ 
Deutschland 
liegt am allen fronten
. 
Q: So that mean Œ 
allen fronten
. 
A: You know, this Œ this was a very Œ 
Q: And how would you translate that? 
A: The German lies on all the fronts. You k
now, flat. So this, they didn™t like it at 
all, because many places they had 
Deutschland siegt am allen fronten
. And th ere 
were propag anda signs by Dr. 
Goebbels
, even showing a Polish sold ier wounded, 
and 
Churchill
, and the Polish sold ier is saying, 
England
, this is your deed. I don™t 
know if you saw it in some of the books. 

Q: No. So Œ oh th
e Œ so the fact Œ 
A: That the guilt Œ the gu
ilt lies in engl Œ with 
England
, you know, that Œ 
Q: That 
Poland 
is o Œ okay. 
A: Œ they are guilty of Œ of
 our suffering, and so on. 
There was tremendous shock, 
the time I Œ  that was 1943, around the spri
ngtime, March or Œ March, I think. There 
was mutual agreement between 
Poland

, 
Siko rski
,
 
with ma Œ with the Russians, fighting 
against common enemy. 
Q: Correct. 
A: But, when there was 
Katyn
 discovery , what happened is that the Germans 
advanced, and th ey stop at 
Smolensk
, 
Charkow
. They found this 
massive graves Œ 
graves, Polish graves. These were places 
of execution of the Polish officers that 
were captured during that attack on the 17
th
 of March. 
Q: September. 
A: I mean, 17
th
 of September, 1939, wh en they  stabbed us in the back. 
Q: Right. 
A: They deported million 
and a half Poles to 
Siberia
, and they separated the 
military personnel to be, let™s say, kept in
 the different camps.
 Out of this they 
selected the officers. The officers were th
e officers of reserves, so there were, you 
know, lawyers, doctors, professional office
rs and all kind of intelligentsia that was 
part of that 200-some 20 prisoners of wa
r that these Russians captured. Out of this 
they selected the officers, 
and they were executed in 
Katy n
. 
Q: So you™re talking 220,000? 
A: Two hundred twenty
 military personnel. 
Q: Okay . Only 220 Œ

A: Œ they selected the Œ 
Q: The officers. 
A: The officers, and so on. They  Œ 

Q: So what happened  when  
the graves were discovered? 
How is that received in 
Warsaw
? 
A: As the Germans advanced, and they
 discovered Œ immediately the Russian 
propaganda was saying that the Germans 
did it, you know, and th ey tried to blame 
the Russians for this. The Germans, to pr
ove the case, they have asked the higher 
ranking officers, British, French , and th
en whoever was there from the western 

European 
POW
 camps, and they  form a commission. And th is commission was 
joined by the Red Cross, and 
they all went to the passive disc Œ discovery of these 
big, massive graves, and th ey selected the ca
liber of the guns that they were using to  
shoot them in
 the back Œ 
Q: Okay, I want to make sure I understand.
 They selected not on
ly th  Œ they  asked 
not only the international Red Cross, but th
eir own prisoners of war that they had 
captured Œ 

A: Yes.

Q: They formed a commission from 
some of these selected people Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ who were prisoners themselves, to
 go to the site of the mass graves Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ and do what? 

A: Exhume the bodies. Check, you know, so
me of the insignias, dog tags, and the Œ 
the Œ the bullets that normally they found 
the skulls with the 
hole in the back, 
because the prisoners were tied in the back
, walked into the room, and shot by the 
NKVD
 Œ 

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ in the back 
of their heads. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So this was a shock for me, when I wa
lked into classroom, and I saw my teacher 
crying, Mrs. 
Bernisz

A: 
Bernisz
(ph), you know. Her brother, Lieutenant 
Bern isz
(ph), a Polish lieutenant 
Œ she admitted that she was of German de
scent, even for generations in Œ in 
Warsaw
. So  she says Œ she was crying, you 
know, and I ask he
r now, why do you 
cry ma™am? What happened? You know, she 
just si mply pushed 
a Red Cross card, a 
notification postal card to me, and then I ripp
ed it over, and I looked at this, and that 
was his name listed among th e bodies exhumed from that mass grave. 
Q: Oh. 
A: And this changed en tirely, the diplom
atic relations with the Polish government 
in exile. They were broken, these relations
 were broken, and th
e Russians ignored 
the free legal Polish government. They said that this is not true, the Germans did it, 

and we were siding with  the fascists, you 
know. Th-The Œ the regular way of the 
Russian lies that are Œ even now you can s Œ listen to

 and Œ and Œ 
and Œ and see how nicely he forms certain 
ways of how to do the right thing the 
Russian way. 
Q: I see. Let™s go back to these ev
ents. So people discovered that Œ 
Warsaw
 begins 
to discover that these missing officers ha
ve been mu rd ered by the rus Œ the Soviet 
forces.

Q: How did it Œ how did people find out in 
general abou Œ was this something that 
the Germans were Œ were broadcasting? 
A: Well, they were the Œ they were dr
umming it up. Germans were drumming it up, 
and the situation was even getting worse an
d worse, because the Polish formations 
of soldiers in 
Russia
, under the command of General 
Anders 
Œ 
Q: Yes. 

A: Œ there was a situation when 
Siko rski
 met with 
Stalin
 and all the other big brass, 
Russian brass in Œ in Œ in 
Moscow
, I think, and he asked about, wh ere are the Polish 
officers? Because when we 
formed these units, Polish un
its to fight the Germans, 
where are the officers? And the Russians re
sponded by saying, you know, th ey were 
somewhere in 
Manchuria
 and they run away. They escape from the captivity. They 
never admitted Œ they Œ you 
know when they ad
mitted? When Œ I forgot his name,

d to the Polish officers. 
Q: So we™re talking well over 50 years later. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Yes. And Œ and Œ and

 admitted too, and he se
aled off that this was 
the Russian doing. 

Q: Okay. Your Œ let™s talk a little bit 
about your activities. Your e Œ inducted

A: Twelve Œ

A: Œ 13, yeah. 

Q: And what was your involvement? Tell us about that. 
A: My in volvement Œ when  I was sworn in

You know, 
Szare Szeregi
, Gray Ranks. That was sort 
of divided by age, you know, 
Za w i s z a c y
 were the youngest ones, which was a pa
rt of it. That was from, let™s say, 
12 to  about 15. And then 
Sko
y Bo jowe
, the Œ the military schools, were from, let™s 
say 15 - 16, up to about 18. And then
 was Œ third group was the gr Œ 
Grupa  
Sztrumowa

guys 18 and up. Th
at was a full 
military preparations, they we
re train in the forests fo

military action was cal

military organization. The lower group Œ 
Q: So you™re saying there were Œ th

A: Three different categories guid
ed by age. So let™s say the 
Sko
y Bojowe
, some 
guys were lying their age to join , you know
, to be more active in
 the more advanced 
group, let™s say, 
Sko
y Bojowe
. So they pretended they are different Œ 
Q: They™re older. 

A: They™re olders, you know, the husky on
e. I was always small Œ small and puny, 
so I couldn™t even pretend that, so
 Œ anyway, they put me in that 
Szare Szeregi
, and 
they put me in the platoon one, an
d this was the squad of yul Œ th e 
regina
(ph )  
yulka
(ph). That was in 
[indecipherable]
 Œ what our activities were. So we were 
sabotaging the German vehicles as mu ch as
 we could, you know. Even methods like

gasholz

Œ to Œ to 
burn, and form the methane gas 
that was actually the propelling Œ 
Q: Agen t. 
A: Œ energy of the cars. So there was an ai
r intake, and we used 
to put potatoes into 
the air intake and that thing would die. 
We put sugar into ta nks, then the Germans 
introduced 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: But aren™t these Œ we Œ 
then Œ then, but these are de
ficit items, the potatoes, and 
the sugar. 
A: Yes, yes, they were deficit items, but necessary. So they were sacrificed. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And then  we were using 
all kind of propaganda posters to counteract the German 
propaganda posters. Like, for instance , the mysterious death of General 
Siko rs ki
 in 
Gibralta r
. When General 
Siko rs ki
 was visiting Po lish troops 
in the Near East, le Œ

Kim Philby

 Œ 
Prchal
? 
Q: 
Prchal

A: 
Prchal

A: The plane was a Liberator, I think, and 
when that thing ended up in water, most 
of these Œ even daughter of General

, and some liaison officers, British 
officers died. So the

Prchal
. 
Q: Okay , and th is is what year?

Œ 
A: How these things here, the wa Œ th
e Œ the posters were

there was sign about wh
at, 15 inches by 12 
inches, you know, with th
e inscription, General 
Sikorski
 tragic death in 
Gibraltar
 
and so on. We were posting in 
on any streets, main str ee ts in 
Warsaw
, to notify the 
public of wh at happened, you know
. Not all had the access to Œ to 
BBC
 reports. 
Q: Did you have a radio at home? 
A: I had a crystal radio, you know, something. 

Q: What™s a crystal radio? 
A: Crystal radio di Œ was some kind of a 
magnetic stuff, with 
the earphones, that 
you could pick some of the wa
ves, you know, from the air. 
Q: So, you™d have an earphone Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ a Œ you™d have earphones on Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ and then you™d have some so
rt of Œ wh at did it look like? 
A: It was Œ look like a cr Œ a crystal, a meta
llic crystal, silver dots in it. But that was 
a poor reception. 
Q: So, but it Œ it wasn™t even a box, it was 
just like a little knob,
 or something like 
that. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
106
A: Knob, yeah. But friends of ours that we us
ed to go and visit, they had their radio 
in the big heating Œ heating ovens. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Heating ovens. That the radio was mounted
 in the back, and at night we used to 
listen to the 
BBC
 program. And you know, ther
e was a sp ecial section in 
AK
 that 
was, let™s say, printing out on the basis 
of true news, because the German news 
were always partial on protecting the German side, and they never admitted their Œ 

Q: Weaknesses.  
A: Œ what was mistak es and Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ and things like that. They were alwa
ys trying to minimi
ze their losses, and 
maximize theyŒ whatever
 they needed to Œ to
 Œ to tell us to bra Œ break the morale 
of the occu  Œ occupied  nations. 
Q: So your Œ so you would 
be sabotaging the cars Œ 
A: Sabotaging the cars, and then  a second 
assignment was that, since there were two 
main bridge Œ two main bridges across the 
Vistula
 River to the eastern front, our 
assignment was to stay at hidden places, and mark and co unt the equipment, the 
armaments that went over the bridge. 
Tanks, armo r cars, any cars, any guns, 
anything that was on wheels. 
So we used to have charts
 and mark these things to 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
107
send later on to our headquarters, wh
ich in turn sent it over to Œ to 
London
. That 
was very useful, because the Brits knew,
 you know, what strength actually, the 
Germans are sending to the eastern front, that
 this was a sign to us on two bridges; 
Poniatowski
 bridge, and 
Kierbedzia 
bridge. So very  often my  duty was to be on 
the observing observer™s point. 
Q: So, until you mentioned this, I figured 
most of those things
 that you would be 
doing, you™d have to do in the even
ings, when that Œ when night fell. 
A: Not in the beginning. We had these garbage Œ little garbage carts Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ you know, that there sometimes we
re Œ  tilted them over. 
And under the cover, 
we were sitting there and doing all kind 
of dangerous markings in the different 
charts to Œ to counter the Œ the Œ th
e pieces that were across the bridge. 
Q: I see, so  in the Œ in th
e daytime you would observe Œ 
A: After the police hours, at night, wi 
Œ you know, daytime, sure, we were doing 
this something by hearts, you know, watc
hing and sitting on the curb of the 
sidewalk, you know, watching Œ 

Q: Just like that. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
108
A: Watching this. And what else 
did we do dirty for the Germans. 
Q: For th e Home Army. 

A: This was Œ you know, we were very cr
itical of people going to  Œ to Œ to movie 
theaters, and we had a saying, 
ty lko  
˚
winie sied

c w kinie
.  
Q: What does that mean? 

A: Only the pigs sitting 
in the movie theaters. 
Q: And why would that be? 
A: We used to Œ yeah , we used to put 
the name with the ta
r, you know, on the Œ on 
the entrance to the theat
ers. And that worked. 
Q: But why would Œ w
hy would that be Œ 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 the money that was spent by the Poles that went to the 
arma ments of the Œ this was govern ment 
Œ the German government contro lled. 
Q: I see, so  Œ I see. So it wasn™t that pe
ople wanted to have some relief, an-and see 
some sort of fantasy and escape from rea
lity, it was because it was a way of helping 
the economy. 
A: Yes. 

Q: The German economy. 
A: Yes. There was another scene that I re
me mb er. S ee, th ey  se
t up Œ wh en th e war 
started, the 
Barb arossa Operation
 started, there was a big empty square right by

the central railroad station, so the Ge
rmans built a big screen to show their 
victorious march, 
drang nach osten
, push to the east. The 
Barbarossa Operation
, 
they were showing. 
Q: So that™s June 1941, mm-hm. 
A: Yes. They were showing, you know, th e 
[indecipherable]
 
Kraków
, all the areas 
that were taken away from 
the Soviets, they were ta
king Russian prisoners by 
thousands, by th ousands. And Œ and Œ and th
e Russians were giving
 up. They didn™t 
have the spirit, they didn™t ha
ve the good officers at that
 time. Why they didn™t have 
the good officers? Because the officers were 
chistka
. You know what a 
chistka
 is? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: The Œ 
Stalin
 in 1935 noticed that 
there were some kind of 
plot to Œ that they 
were trying to Œ 
Q: Overth row him. 

A: Œ overthrow him. And th is 
was among the Russian officers. 
Q: Was it really a plot, or did he think it was a plot? 

A: There was something that the 
Stalin
 was so upset, that he immediately ordered 
them to be put behind the ba
rs, and many of them were 
eliminated. There was this 
case, and also Œ what else they
 Œ they were trying? Oh  see, there was a lack of a Œ of

110
a higher command among the Russians at th
e time when the German were pushing 
forward. 

Q: Okay, so it meant 
Œ it meant that in 
Warsaw
, you™d have these big screens up, 
and Œ and you Œ and 
people would see Œ 
A: At the central statio n, yes Œ 

Q: And people would see? 

A: Ye Œ they  Œ you know, 
people were curious always
, you know, when  they  saw 
the Œ 

Q: So it was like an open movie theater? 

A: Like an open movie theater. There wa
s no drive-in, but just an open Œ open 
theater, and the people wanted to know, ev
en there were the Œ at the time, these 
were the true things. The blitz Œ the German
 blitz was so effective that they were 
taking th ousands and thousands of Russian prisoners. 

Q: Did they ever show Ge
rmans taking Jews up? I me
an, in Œ in those reels, 
newsreels? 

A: No. 

Q: Did th ey ever show anyt
hing about what their behavior was to the Jews of the 
east?

A: To the Jews of the east, no, I Œ I 
don™t rememb er anything like this, but I 
remember the operation when
 we used the eggshells. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Eggshells, we blow up the egg,
 you know, whites and yellow and Œ 
Q: Red? 
A: Œ and fill it up with Œ w
ith paint, dark paint. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And we were sitting in the 
first row. And when we saw 
Hitler 
delivering some 
kind of a speech, we used to
 toss these things against, 
and you could see the streaks 
of the things. And then the Germans, afte
r a while, they discontinued this kind of 

propaganda. They  discontinue. 
Q: Well, of Œ of Œ of everything that yo
u were telling me about, this sounds the 
riskiest, cause if somebody fa Œ 

A: That was risky, yes. Our operations 
even  there, were done by the young Œ 
youngsters Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ they were very risky. 
Q: Yeah. And yet Œ and yet, as you descri
be, it sounds like quite important, not just 
work. Not just funny wo
rk, or something.

us as Œ as Œ as misbehaving youngsters 
doing, and risking sometimes, the lives of 
the grownups. But this was necessary to ke
ep  the mo rale of the people, and Œ and 
the morale of the Œ 
Wa rsa w
, occupied  
Wa rsa w 
was very strong, very strong. 
Q: I want to turn now to 
the ghetto. Did you see the wa
lls of the ghetto being built? 
A: Yes. This was along the 
Leszno
 Street. 
Leszno
 Street, which was parallel to 
Wolska Ch
o dna  
thoroughfare that I was sa ying Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ toward the 
Kierbedzia 
bridge. 
Leszno
 Œ there were the co
unty courts, and the 
brick wall was separating into  two halves, 
the Aryan side and the Jewish side. And 
that wall, at that particular part, what
 they did there was ex-execution of Polish 

hostages, at 
Naruto wicz 
square, in 
Ochota
 district of
 Warsaw
. And there was a 
rumor that the people that were shot over
 there, they were brought in and hung on 
the balcony metal parts, you know, these vertical Œ 
Q: Sure. 
A: Œ memb ers. They were hung by the neck
s to Œ in order to show and let™s say 
show their punishment toward the Poles, what they can exp
ect if they don™t stay at 
the bay and Œ and Œ and Œ a
nd Œ and listen to the Œ to 
the authorities of German Œ 
the German administration, as a sign of 
their rule, they want

A: Yes, yes. I personally saw it. There 
was about 27. And I wa
s wondering if buddy 
of mine, 
Kazik
(ph), that he was one of them, but
 I couldn™t recognize. You know, 
people, when they get shot
, you know, they freeze in 
their position. And you could 
see that these people were not hung there alive. 

Q: Oh, I see. So they had already b
een killed in some form, and were Œ 
A: Yes, and Œ 
Q: Œ hung th ere. Okay . And the purpose of 
it was not Œ had nothing to do with th e 
ghetto, but it happened to be phy
sically close to the ghetto? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Let™s say on the wall, th Œ at that tim
e, you know, in order to see some kind of a 
violent reaction by the Pole
s, they Œ the Germans had th e two machine guns, I 
reme mb er, on top of the wall, directed to
 the Poles marching alongside the wall. 

Q: Was this a Œ was this a Œ was this a 
mandatory kind of march, you were Œ you 
had to go see it? 

A: Yes, yes, the people were 
forced almost, to
 see it, yeah.

Q: Okay. And then it was Œ this also at
 the time when the ghetto wall was being 
built, or was already built? 
A: No, there Œ it was already built. That™s Œ I™m speaking of year, I think was 40 Œ 
™43. 
Q: Okay .

who was murdered duri
ng solidarity times. 
A: Yes, 
Popie

which was going to  Œ to  bank Œ Bank Square. 
Plac Ba nkowe

Warsaw
. 
Q: So does this mean th
at until then the two ghetto

A: They never were connected. 
Q: Even with that bridge? 

A: Let™s say they never Œ let™s say, 
they were, on that portion that was from 
Wronia 
to

elazna
, they were connected, small and Œ 
Q: And large. 

A: Œ and large. And then, in order to ke
ep the traffic between small and large was 
that bridge. 

Q: Okay . 

A: Was that bridge, so there were Œ 

Q: And so did you Œ 
A: Œ connections, yes.

 the pictures in that album that I show

Q: I Œ as I say, what™s important for me is not what is published later, but wh at are 
your specific recollections. So Œ 
A: I saw it, yes, because Œ 

Q: You saw it. 

A: Œ I was going to  that school for almo st a year. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So almost on a daily basis. 

Q: And this is where your teach Œ the sc
hool where your teachers were observing 
you, and then later recommende
d that you be part of the 
AK
? 
A: 
AK
.  
Q: I see. 

A: They recruited me there, yes.

117
A: And 
Bernisz
(ph) was the third one, yes. That was already wh en I was going to 
the sixth grade, but this was a cover-up, 
because actually I was going to  that first 
year of high school. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But pretending th at the schools, the un
derground schools not Œ not existed, so Œ 
Q: Sure. 

A: Œ this was used for a cover-up. Trad e schools, and all schools that actually 
Germans considered that th ey can stay open, like a lit
tle business school. But th e 
higher education was out 
of question. The poli Œ 
Warsaw Polytechnics
, which was 
very large institution, and we
ll-known; the University of 
Warsaw
 was also cl osed, 
but the faculty, even some of
 them were murdered in

 operation. 
But some teachers that surv
ived, they used to partic
ipate in that underground 
schooling. 
Q: I see. N o w, in your Œ in your 
AK
 unit, you were known only  by your 
pseudonym, not by your real name.

A: The cell was about

 number one was

 one was 
about six, seven guys. I knew th em 
all, because we had the meetings. 
Q: Okay . 
A: We were getting instructi
ons, we were getting training. 
Q: Did you ever know their real names? 
A: Yes, some of them I knew, yes, yes. 

Q: And they  knew 
your real name? 
A: Yes, but we was Œ we were penaliz
ed if we used any family names. 
Q: Okay . Okay. 

A: You know, this Œ this underground, that
 was actually there 
was the Œ one of the 
largest underground the wo
rld, in Œ in occupied 
Euro pe
, by the Germans. We had Œ 
AK
 had the connections, and th
ere were planes coming from 
England
 to 
Poland
 to 
pick up some representatives 
to the Polish government in 
London
, and some 
important people. So there were a lot o
f, how should I say, connections and the 
practical sh aring of certain, let™s say,
 things that were very valuable. 
Q: Did you know th at at the time? 

A: About the planes that were coming to 
Poland
? No Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ no, no.

Q: We need to distinguish that, because Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ then it gets murky. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Where it is, the Œ the adult 
Thaddeus Gubala
 is talking about something, and 
where it is the experience of the child. 

A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. I didn™t 
know the operation, the secret operation, but after the 
war I was engrossed in all kind of reading 
books, wh atever I could find, because we 
were, let™s say, eager to learn what was 
happening behind our back s, you know, at 
that time.  
Q: Sure, sure. 
A: So, the underground was very effec
tive, and very help
ful to the allies. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t know if I can mention right now Œ 
Q: If it™s your Œ excu se me, I™m going to in terrupt; is it your experience? 
A: That was my experience that I knew th
e operations, and th e help that we were 
getting from 
England
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Yeah.

Q: Then tell me about it. 
A: Because we were getting the Œ I mean, 
the higher groups, th
ere was even money 
sent to 
Poland
. 
Q: And did you ever see any of it? 

A: No, I would Œ I wasn™t paid in Œ 

Q: In money. 

A: Œ dollars, no. 
Q: Were you paid in  anything? 
A: No, no. 

Q: Okay . 
A: We were Œ we were the youngsters, and ve
ry helpful in the operation, but sort of 
secondary  help. 
Q: Well, you™re young Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ you™re children. And I™m 
sure they didn™t want to 
put you in too mu ch  danger. 
A: That™s right. Even during 
the uprising, we were not subj
ect to the strict military 
rules. 

Q: Yeah. Tell me wi Œ I want to come no
w to the Œ both upris
ings. Did you see any 
part of the ghetto uprising? 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
121
A: As I was walking to school, this was, 
I think to ward  the end of May Œ no, toward  
the end of April, because May, th-the 
uprising stopped. It was liquidated by, I 
would say, May 19, I believe. 
Q: I think it Œ I don™t know the exact 
date, but I think it was mid-April that it 
started. 
A: Yes, mid-April. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: During that time, th e 
ghetto was on fire. General 
Stroop
, he brought to ghetto Œ 
he brought the Ukrainians that were serv
ing with the Germans. I notice Latvians, 
because they had different, da
rk uniforms that were part
 of the guard, around. And 
there were Germans in the supervisory sort
 of positions as mil
itary. This Œ what I 
notice, that a lot of people on th e Aryan side were looking from the gates of their 
apartments, you know, looking toward th
e ghetto to see how sometimes people 
were throwing people out of the windows. 
Instead of being burn ed , you know, they 
committed suicide. I saw flam
es coming out because the 
Germans actually set fire 
as they were conquering Œ 

Q: Clearing up, yeah, right. 
A: Œ clearing up the Œ the segments. I saw 
this, yes. Because that point of bridge, 
you know, that I said, 
two divided streets, 
Elektoraina 
and 
Ch

, this was a

main gate. Main gate. Acro
ss kitty corner from that 
building there, there was 
Vacha
(ph), there was a very strong German
 point that the guardsmen were the 
Feldpolizei
; that was the military police, you know Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ they  were armed, and there was a 
bunker, bunk Œ concrete 
bunker to protect 
their segment of the buildi
ng. The build ing is Œ even
 now that™s stan ding, it 

survived the uprising. 
Q: Wow. Okay. 
A: Yeah. And that bunker actu
ally there is the original bu
nker that is shown in that 
uprising mu seum in Œ in 
Warsaw
. 
Q: So you would see the flames
 of these Œ of the build ings. 
A: Flames, and the people jump ing out of the windows, yes. 

Q: You would see that too? 

A: Mm-hm. Because at Œ 
Q: Was there a smell? 
A: Œ when Œ when the Ge
rmans Œ when the Germans were setting up fire Œ 

Q: Yeah.

A: Œ at the ground level, you know, and th
e flames started shooting up, some of 
them I saw escaping from one building, ju
mping over to another one just to get 
away from the buildings that are set on fire. 
Q: I see. 
A: Very cruel behavior was of the Jewish police. 

Q: Wa Œ in what way? 

A: In what way? They were responsible fo
r gathering the Jews for that shipment to 
Treblinka
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And they were cruel, becau
se they were responsible to
 deliver that many Jews as 
the Germans ordered them. 

Q: Well, what choice did they  have? 

A: They were very crue
l. And then, the Œ the Œ 
Q: But again, I Œ 
A: Œ producer Œ producer of that film Œ 
Q: Mm-hm, which one? 

A: 
Kanista

of the film in Œ in Œ in

124
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ the people were whistling 
and Œ and Œ and Œ an
d really criticizing that this is 
not true that the Jews were
 so cruel toward the Jews. 
Q: I have to  Œ I Œ i-it can all be true. I don™
t know that. But in Œ 
in our discussion, if 
you Œ if it™s something that 
you say, I need to substantiate it with, did you see it? 
A: Do Œ yes, did I see it. 

Q: And if you saw it Œ and ho
w Œ in  Œ in wh at way did 
you see it. So, did you see 
this cruelty? 

A: Yes, I did, yes Œ 

Q: In what way? 
A: Œ I di Œ in  wh at way? Where the peop
le were actually were set on fire in the 
windows, jumping out. 
Q: All right, by the Jewish police? 

A: Combined forces. There were Jews a
nd there were Germans, and there were 
Ukrainians guards at the main gate
. So I saw this, yes, I saw this. 
Q: Okay , okay. 

A: I saw, let™s say before the Jewish upri
sing, I saw the groups of Jews that were 
recruited to work on the Aryan side for th
e German factories, 
whatever they had. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
125
A: Marched by the blue policemen, or
 the German policem
en, toward their 
destination where they were 
working. There was, let™s sa
y, sometimes 50 - 60 Jews 
marching through th e Aryan side to their place where they wo rked . 
Q: Okay . 
A: And the behavior of Œ to
ward  the Jews was awful. 
I mean, for the Poles that 
helped th e Jew, you know Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ that was the only country in 
Euro pe
 that for helping the Jew, there was a death 
penalty. The only country in 
Europe
 that if they saw you helping Jew, you could be 
shot on the spot. And if they didn™t do this, 
then they arrested yo
ur family, or even 
some of the buildings where 
this occurred, you know Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ they were all liquidated. 

Q: So you would see Œ you w
ould see guards be cruel to Jews who were being taken 
to wo rk outside of the ghetto on the Aryan side? 

A: Yes. There was kicking, pushing, 
shouting, and things like this, yes. 
Q: Okay . Did Œ oh, I had a question, and it just escaped my  mind. And you saw 
people jumping from roof to roof wh
ile the ghetto uprising was going on? 
A: As the flames were spreading ou
t, they were running away, yes. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
126
Q: Did Œ was there a smell comin g  from the ghetto? 
A: Oh yes, day and night, because the 
Germans were bombing ghetto during the 
night. There were Œ they brought heavy gun
s, and they  were using the armo r cars 
when the uprising started, because the gr
oup of fighting Jews, there was about 350 

of them, you know, that some of them 
were equipped with the weapons delivered 
by th e 
AK
, and they were heroic in their atte
mpt. They knew that this is the only 
solution, is to die fighting. 
Q: Did Œ were there any 
Jewish boys in your cell?  
A: In my cell no, no. 

Q: Were there any in the 
Œ in that category in the 
AK
, you know Œ you know, in this 
youngest age category, that you knew of? 

A: Repeat that question. 

Q: Okay . You explained to me there were three categories; the gray Œ 

A: Gray ranks Œ 
Q: The Gray Ranks.

A: And then  
Grupy  Szturmo wa
. 
Q: Right. In that youngest category, did 
you know of any Jewish boys who were in 
there, who might have escaped from the ghetto? 
A: No, no. 
Q: Okay . 

A: There were no Jews, but I heard that there were some Œ 

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ in the upper ranks. 
Q: I see. 

A: In the upper ranks. And especially 
during the uprising Œ maybe I™m time-wise 
jumping too far ahead. 
Q: Which, which, the 
Warsaw
 uprising? 
A: The
 Warsaw 
uprising. There were Œ in th e ghe
tto there were Jews that were 
brought from 
Hungary
, but they were protected by 
th eir skills, you know, tailors, 
shoemakers that were contri
buting to the war machine. 
Q: The German war machine. 

A: The German war machine. 
Q: Right.

A: And 
Zo
˚
ka
 battalion, wh ich was one of the l
eading scouts, but Œ Boy Scouts, but 
they were a Œ 18 and up. 
So they freed ab
out 350, and they called the gang 
Shufka
(ph). 
Gesia
 Street was the street in the 
ghetto, and they had these barracks 
where they  were work ing Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ for the German war ma
chine. So some of these 
guys joined the Polish units 
during th e 
Warsaw
 uprising. 
Q: When they were liberated
, however, when were they lib
erated, by the Œ by the si 
Œ 

A: By th e 
AK
 people. 
Q: Yeah, when? 

A: This was 1944, I would say th
e middle of Œ middle of August. 
Q: But my question is, by th
at point, the ghetto is ob
literated. There is no more 
ghetto. The uprising had been  put down  Œ 
A: Yes, the ghetto Œ the ghetto was put out. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I™m speaking of some remains of the 
skilled Jews that were used for the war 
machine, that were separated from 
the rest of the Jews in Œ in 
Shufka
(ph), and these 
were the Hungarian Jews that were kept. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
129
Q: Okay. Hungarian Jews weren™t deported from 
Hungary
 until March ™44. So, in 
other wo rds, they couldn™t 
have been part of the 
Warsaw 
ghetto. They couldn™t 
have been part of the 
Warsaw
 ghetto that was obliterate
d, and yet they™re kept 
alive. They must have 
been brought in later. 
A: I think so . It could be like this, becau
se there was even a negotiation between the 
allies, the Œ the Germans demanded truc
ks for trading freedom for these Jews. 
There was something secret th
at I Œ I never, let™s say, an
alyzed this so deep, but 
they were trying to save the Jews by giving so me Œ 
Q: Getting some materials for them. 

A: Œ material for them. 
Q: I see. 
A: But these Jews were brought from 
Hungary
, yes. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Hungarian Jews. 
Q: So, it would have been in ™44. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Rather than Œ rather
 than any time earlier. 
A: Yes, yes. And these Œ 

Q: And that would have been wh en  
the ghetto was already a Œ a Œ gone. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
130
A: No, th e ghetto, th e ghetto, th e small and large one was already finished. 
Q: Yeah, okay. Okay, so let™
s talk about your activities 
in 1943, and 1944, until the 
Warsaw
 uprising. 
A: Well, these activities I mentioned to 
you, the little sabotage that we had Œ 

Q: It continued. 

A: Œ on the bridges, and then th e po
sters, and then the inscriptions of 
PW
 Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ in different places, to show that we
 still existing. And marking the theaters and 
the Œ sabotaging the German propaganda slog
ans. So, this was th
e activity of 1942 - 
™43, until the uprising, yes. 

Q: So let™s turn to the uprising. How do 
you Œ wh at ha Œ what do you get involved 
in, what changes in your
 life to prepare to Œ 
A: What happened, th e uprising 
started on the first of August. 

Q: Right, and where were you? 
A: I was near Œ near that 
Janusz Korczak 
building, and Œ 
Q: Where th e orphanage was. 
A: Orph Œ the cro Œ across the street, yes,
 and the last me eting we had with th e 
patrol one, we said that we are going togeth er at 
Kartselak
(ph), which was a 
marketplace right at the 
Wolska
 Street, that main thoroughfare, and 
To wa rowa

and 
Przy okopowa
, this was a large square, like a 
Maxwell
 Street in 
Chicago
, you 
know, there were little stands 
that the people were selling.
 Anything that your heart 
desire, the black market at that time. 
Q: Right. 
A: So, th e meeting didn™t come through 
because of the begi
nning of uprising was 
scheduled  for five o™clock 
[indecipherable]
 stands for 
wa lka
(ph). And there was 
supposed  to be at five, but it started at th
e different time. So wh at happened was that 
I simply joined the ne
wly formed company, 
315
, across the street in that building of 
Janusz Korczak
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And what the Œ happened, they assigne
d me to be the observer. So  I was posted 
on th at highest point of that building th at
 was safe from that 
siege during the 1939. 
And I was watching the Germans coming 
Karo lko wa
 Street, toward the 
Wo lska
. 
This was street Œ side street, but anyway 
important, because they tried to clear both 
sides of 
Wolska
, so the German traffic would go free, without any side Œ side 
attacks. But what we did over first a
nd second of the uprising day, we build a 
barricade and a deep ditch on 
Karo lkowa 
Street. So the German
s, w h en  th ey  came 
over, to the point I saw them, I was reporting 
down that there is a German armor car 
waiting, but they hesitating to cross because of the obstacle. Then Œ this was couple

days like this, and then, before Œ actually,before uprising started, I was put to work 
by cleaning some old rifles that w ere recove
red from the hiding pl
aces, for an attack 
by th e grownups, of that School 100. Becau
se School 100 th at
 I attended during Œ 
before the war Œ 
Q: Sure. 

A: Œ this whole building was converted to
 a rest house for the Germans. All the 
nicer buildings Œ 
Q: The beau tiful building where you didn™t 
walk with shoes. Where you walk ed on 
your si Œ 
A: Yes, yes, this was converted to a sh elter fo r the Germans that were coming to 
Warsaw 
to rest, after the battle fatigue Œ 
Q: I see. 

A: Œ wh atever they had in the east, or Œ 
they were re-convalescence after they were 
wounded, whatever. Most of the better build
ings were taken by the Germans, by the 
Germans. So anyway, this attack failed, 
because the Germans were armed to the Œ 
Q: Teeth. 

A: Œ kin. And th is thing was a failure. 
Q: Okay .

A: So th e next operation, 
what happened was, on the 
V
 separation of two streets, 
To wa ro wa 
and 
Przy okopowa
, there was a German repair shop, for German 
vehicles. So, we were told that 
we have to get gasoline for the 
Moloto v
 cocktails. 
And I remember from 1939 I ha
d these flare Œ flare gun. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: That was my  weapon. There was 
one guy that Œ with the saw off 
Mauser
, you 
know, carbine? Anyway, wh en we Œ there wa
s about five of us, two mechanics, and 
there were two, three of younger ones, yo
u know, and we entered that place, the 

Germans got scared off. They
 got on a Œ motorbikes, and 
they left. So we started 
getting th e cars into some kind of a position th at maybe we can start Œ 
Q: Drive them out. 
A: Œ driv e them out. So  one of the mechan
ics, you know, he was able to Œ the car 
had the fo ur tires on. The others didn™t have
 the tires on because they were over the 
Œ what they call, the tu
nnels, that they were Œ 
Q: That™s right, where they were repairing. 

A: Repairing, yeah. 

Q: Repairing things. 
A: So the one with the four tires was oka y, so he started this car. But in the 
meantime, what I was 
doing is I was collecting into  jerry cans Œ 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
134
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You know the jerry cans are. 

Q: Sure. 
A: Those 20 liter Œ 
Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, right. 

A: Œ metal containers. I was sucking Œ si
phoning the gasoline fro
m the ones that Œ 
Q: Were on ther Œ right. 
A: Œ have the tires on, that 
was getting ready for repairs. 
Q: Okay . 

A: So I was able to put about two Œ two 
Œ tw o of these canisters, jerry cans Œ 
Q: How were you siphoning? 

A: With the rubber hose. 

Q: And you were sucking it in? 

A: Suck ing it in. Once it started, you know
, then the gasoline 
was dripping out. 
Anyway , I was Œ this was the mo st precious
 liquid at the time, because the comp any 

315
 was waiting for delivery of weapons, 
but it never materialized, you know, they 
didn™t get it. So the most 
effective weapons were the 
Molotov 
cocktails. Some of 
the units that were on the barricade on 
Gorczewska 
Street, parallel to 
Wolska
, right 
at 
M
ynarska
, these were barricades attacked by 
the Germans, and they were trying 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
135
to really break the opposition at any cost.They were even putting civilians in front 
of their tanks, and Œ and Œ 
and approach ing the Po lish points of resistance Œ 
Q: With the civilians in front? 
A: Yeah, so we would stop shooting, you 
know, at our own people. And anyway, I 
delivered Œ I could carry the whole jerry can
, but I take half of it, co uple times. I 
walked from 
Krochma
na
, from that 
J a n u s z K o rcza k 
place, and I carried this over 
to 
Gorczewska
 Street, which was a distance of at 
least five, six, seven blocks, as a 
small kid, with a friend of mine. 

Q: That™s not Œ that™s not bad Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ that™s quite a bit. 
A: And you know, th ey welcomed me at th
e barricade when I brought that gasoline, 
because whenever Germans approached Œ 
and the houses on the left, and on the 
right, you know, had these bo
ttles, you know, these things
 were very dangerous for 
the Germans 
[indecipherable]
 we set the fire to a tank,
 you know, the Œ the Œ the 
crew was jumping out. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So th is was one of the major operati
ons. Then this other 
one Œ oh, this was 
something that I™ll never forget. We were to
ld, for the areas that were already freed 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

136
from the Germans, to hang ou
r national flags in front of the houses. And this was a 
Œ boo-boo, because the German
s marked the areas they sa w the flags; there were 
observation planes flying over, and three 
Stuka s
 came o v er, and bombed again, the 
area where we lived in. 
Q: Oh. 

A: They flatten it out. I remember as a ki 
Œ that I was Œ I Œ I was holding a Œ a Œ a 
radiator, you know, on the first flo o r, a
nd so mehow I was found semi-conscious in 
the Œ in the basement. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. 
Q: From that flattening out? 
A: From that flattening out. And then, 
after this, we all took a shelter in the 
Korczak™s 
build ing Œ 
Korcza k™s 
build ing. And th en Œ th
at was August third or

a Russian, and he recruited the Ukrainians, 
and Russians, whoever was available,
 and so me Œ some Mongols from the 
Azure
, 
to put them to work on 
Poles, the rebellious Poles, and finish us off. 
Q: So in other words, this was 
a group of Russians who were Œ

A: Yes. They had the Cossacks Œ 

Q: Hat? 

A: Œ hats, with the 
Ha ken kreuz
, and the German 
Wehrmacht
 uniforms, and some 
of them had the 
SS
 marks. So they  were special troops. 
Q: So what was this Œ what was disti

A: And they  were used  to especially quenc

countries occupied by th

General 
Bach
, 
von dem Bach
. 
Q: 
Von dem Bach
, okay. 
A: 
Von dem Bach
. He was in charge, a specialist 
for the partisan warfare. He was 
in 
Warsaw
 operation on, I think, the fourth  or 
fifth of August. And he was the guy 
that stopped the mass mo r Œ mu rders of that district 
Wola
. Because during that time 
when  the 
R

O
.
N
.
A
. came into picture, and they st
arted shooting civ
ilians, 50,000 of 
ar Œ Soviets lost their lives because they 
were cleaning up, mercilessly, all the side 
streets, and every courtyard was a cemetery. 
Q: So they were indiscriminate
 in who they were shooting? 
A: Yes, yes. To the point wh en that was 
the fifth or sixth of 
August, I was in the 
courtyard Œ that™s where we lived Œ and I 
was in the basement, and some civilians 
went into  basements and th ey were hiding
 there. The windows were covered with 
the sandbags, and some metal plates to 
protect from any kind of outside attack. 
When  the 
R
.
O
.
N
.
A
. soldiers came over, they had this German potato mashers, you 
know, these grenades with
 that little handle on? They
 used to co
mbine these 
grenades together and make the bundle of 
them, and they used to open that little 
windows and they were tossi
ng into the basement of people. And this was almost 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
139
unbelievable scream of people dying in  th
e basements. And th ey took us, the live 
ones, they  took us outside the building. Y
ou know, my  father was already with Œ old 
men separated, and I was pulled by the wo me
n on the left side. They put some kind 
of a babushka on my  head. 

Q: A kerchief on your head? 

A: Yes, and they took us into captivity, 
we were running along this street of 
Krochma
na
, then 
Ka ro lko wa
, to 
Wolska
 Street, then we ke
pt running westbound 
on 
Wolska
 Street. And that time I saw last time 
my  father standing already with the 
hands up in front of 
Biernatzki 
Œ 
Biernatzki
 Palace. That was a big structure right 
in the back of that 
Clement™s 
church. There was the last
 time I saw my father. 
Q: Oh really? 

A: Yes. And we were driven  by
 force, running all the way to 
Wa rsa w 
west sta tion. 
The electrical trains w ere still operating, 
Warsaw 
west. 
Q: Do you know wh at Œ excu se me, 
I™m going to inter Œ do you know wh at 
happened to your father? 

A: Well, there were two stories that I hear
d. That the executions of men during the 
vols Œ vol Œ vol Œ 
Wola  
massacre, the execution of the men were two places: one, 
the Saint 
Albert 
church  on 
Wo lska
 Street, and then 
Franaszek
 factory. This was 
chemical factory when they
 were ex ecuting men by hundreds and hundred s of them. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

140
And when they ki Œ were k
illed, I heard that they were
 piled up, you know, the live 
ones were piling th e dead ones, and 
pouring gasoline over, and burn ing. 
Q: And you think th at he™s in
 either one of these places? 
A: Yes, yes. And I think there is a cemetery, 
Wolski
 
Cmentarz
. 
Wolski
 cemetery, 
that they say that they buried ashe
s of about 50 - 60,000 people from 
Warsaw
, all 
over. They  were exhuming the dead and 
burning them. And by weighing, you 
know, how mu ch ash you get 
from one person, there were 
some 12 or 14 big trucks 
carrying the ashes into a common grave at 
Wo lski
 
Cmentarz
. And I visited this 
place last time I was th ere in August. And there was a big ceremony, there was 

American ambassador, ther
e were Polish president 
Ko moro wski
, an d our new 
allies there was the German
 Bundeswehr
, tw o officers, I took some pictures of 
them; politely watching what was happeni
ng there. It was a big ceremony, and the 
people came and by Œ by hundreds, thousands 
almo st, to participate. They  were four 
spiritual leaders. There was a rabbi, 
there was Orthodox church, there was 
evangelical pastor, and a Catholic, you kno
w. And they  were all praying fo r those 
that were Œ this is the largest cemetery in
 the world actually, of 50 - 60,000 ashes of 

people buried. And they  have the whole yard 
[indecipherable]
 to build with these 
stones, you know, th ey look like a skull.
 And one older wo ma
n, she said, do you 
know the symbol of these stone
s? But this is large area 
I™m speaking of. And I said

no, I don™t know. These are supposed to, le
t™s say symb olize the heads of the people 
that were buried there. 
Wolski Cmentarz
. 
Q: 
Wolski Cmentarz
. What happened to your mo ther and sister? 
A: Mother and sisters, they were
 all put into concentration camp 
Pruszków
. 
Pruszków 
was concentration camp 121. 
Pruszków 
was the
 
station, let™s say, in the 
western part of the city. That™s where th
ey converted railroad repair shop into a 
camp for the civilians brought to it. 
Q: Got it. 
A: So when we were in 
Pruszków
, the 600,000 
[indecipherable]
 went through two 
camps: 
Ozarów 
and 
Pruszków
. 
Q: And I had interrupted you to  find out ab
out your father. So you were telling me 

where you were being herded  to, mo re or
 less, you were being fo rced to run to. 
A: Yes, this was Œ 

Q: So Œ 
A: Œ to 
Warsa w
 west. 
W a rsza wa  za ch o d n ia
, 
Warsaw 
west. That™s where we 
board ed th e trains that took us over to 
Pruszk ów
, that was I don™t know, 20 
kilometers away. 
Pruszków 
was a camp where they were 
loading us into cattle cars 
after two, three days of Œ of tremendous,
 tumultuous situation. People were looking 
for each other, lost you know, wounded, si
ck. There was a Red Cross, and there was 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala

142
that help e Œ help. This whole thing was 
a chaos, you know, there was the Œ people 
were shocked. They were s-semi-alive. They
 were put by 70 to a freight car. When 
they load ed the freight car, there was about
 40 Œ 40 Œ 40 cattle 
cars. And that train 
moved to ward 
Reich
, toward 
Germany
. And we were transported Œ the first stop 
after seven days, no water, no nothing, 
you know, the car wa
s locked. And there 
were Œ 

Q: No fo od, no water. 
A: Yeah, and there was barbed wire in 
the windows. We had 
one Œ one older guy 
with the Œ with the knife, sc
issors. So he was cutting th
e openings in the floor of 
that car, so this was our Œ 

Q: Toilet? 
A: Œ toilet. Toilet, yes. There was 70 peop
le almost, in the car. You know, first stop 
was 
Oranienburg
. You heard of 
Ora n ienburg
? It was a concentration camp that 
the Germans built Œ built for the Germans, a
nd all those that di
d not comply with 
the German philosophy Œ 

Q: Politics, right, right.  

A: Œ yes. So the Œ first were Germans. 
And then, what happened th ere, there was 
night, and I reme mb er 
Berlin
 on fire, you know, there was Œ under bombing, and I 
think that the British at night were bombi
ng it, because they were throwing these

143
phosphor bomb s, and th ey 
looked like a Christmas tr

through that hole Œ 
Q: And this was probably late August, or
 something? When wa
s this, mid-August, 
late August? 

A: That was the beginning of August. Ther
e was the seven Œ no, eight te Œ middle, 
middle, yeah. 

Q: Middle of August. 
A: Middle of Au gust. And wh en we stoppe
d there, what happen
ed is that they 
disconnected three or four cars. And th e 
train was moving at night, not during th e 
daytime, because daytime, any movi
ng train was attacked by the Œ 
Q: Allies. 
A: Œ by the allied, you know, so at ni
ght we moved, an d the next stop was 
Weimar
. 
Q: Oh yeah. 

A: 
Weimar
, near to 
Buchenwald
. 
Q: Exactly, exactly. 

A: Yeah. That was a place that 
Schiller 
and 
Goethe
 was creating. 
Q: Right. 
A: Yes, 
Weimar

A: Yeah. 
Q: And right next to it is 
Buchenwald
. 
A: 
Buch enwald
, yes. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And so th ey disconnected three or four
 cars. They were dist
ributing th e mar Œ th-
the manpower according to
 whatever they Œ 
Q: Needed . 
A: Œ scheduled, yes. 
Q: Right. 

A: So after that, you know, the train star
ted moving at night again, and the next 
stop, I Œ I Œ we knew already that somethi
ng™s gonna happen there. We don™t Œ I use 

the word 
[indeciphera ble]
 you know, as I mentioned to
 you on th e phone, that you 
didn™t know the expression Œ 

Q: That™s right. 
A: Œ that we either will be freed going thro ugh a stack, though a chimney. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Or we wil Œ gonna be
 put to work for the 
Reich
. 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
145
A: So when they moved the train from
 Weimar
, 
Buch enwald
, the next stop was, 
after a few days Œ at night, we tr
av el at night, and we stopped at 
Bergen
-
Belsen
. 
The Œ 
Q: Oh, you were making 
all the tourist stops. 
A: The sightseeing tour, nice. 
Q: Yes. 

A: 
Bergen
-
Belsen 
was a place well-known already. That™s where they killed many, 
many Jewish people and international people 
that were kept in the Œ in this death 
machine. So again, there wa
s a segregation commission. We were out in the field, 
you know, so latrines were 
dug up, so we could satisfy
 our physical necessities 
there. And after medical commission, you 
know, they, luckily, pu
t us into a group 
of people that can be still used for work. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And then  
Bergen
-
Belsen
, they took us to camp. This was near 
Hannover
, 
Lehrte
, 
Lehrte
, 
l-e-h-r-t-e
, 
Lehrte
. 
Q: 
Lehrte
, mm-h m.  
A: And this was a junction, a railroad 
junction, important ra-railroad junction 
between 
Ha nn ov er
 and all the 
ruhrgebeit
(ph) coming th rough 
Hannover
 toward 
Berlin [indecipherable] Berlin
 and all the other main cities. So there Œ the camp 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
146
was located on the Œ right by th e railroad junc
tion. There were at least four or five 
railroad tracks, the main ones. Inside was 
the reloading ramp s, about seven or eight 
reloading zebs Œ that they we
re distributing th e war mate
rial, packages on whatever 
the Germans stole in the western 
Europe
, you know, that were sending over to their 
families in 
Germany
. S o  w e  w o rk ed  fo
r 12 hours a day. 
Q: So you Œ that™s what you 
would be doing, is Œ is relo
ading pack ag es from one to 
another? 
A: Yes, from one car, say that was so
rted out that this car will go to 
Bremen
, this 
car will go to 
Hamburg
, you know, so we were dist
ributing, we were getting the 
shipment orders, and we knew what to do
. In this camp, ther
e was international 
society. They were French, 
they were Belgians, they Œ 
Q: Were you slave labor, or were 
you treated as prisoners of war? 
A: No, th is was Œ th-this was a Œ a thing 
that the Germans didn™t know what to do 
with this, because on the 18
, the pressure of allies in
 the west, exerted on the 
German government, forced th
e Germans to take all the 
AK
 people as allied army, 
and this was treated as the prisoners of 
war. Since I was the younger one, and then I 
couldn™t be, and then  I was as a slave labor
er, put to work . And th is camp  had the 
Frenchmen, Belgians, and there was a Œ a Œ Yugoslavs that Œ not the 
Tito
 guys, but 
Mikhailovich
?

147
Q: That™s right, 
Mikhailo v ich [indecipherable] 
that™s right. 
A: 
Mikh ailovich
. So Serbs were there, and the Ru
ssians were kept in a different Œ 
Q: Place. 
A: Œ section because they di
dn™t recognize the Geneva Co
nvention, they didn™t have 
any Red Cross. Some of the barracks were 
marked with  the Red Cross sign on top, 
because of the importance of that railroad ju
nction. So they tried to show the allies 
up in the air, don™t bomb, because this is 
a  hospital, or whatever they thought for a 
moment. But we were put on these ramps, an
d we wo rked  hard  for a bowl of soup Œ 
Q: So was your Œ 
A: Œ piece of bread. 
Q: Was your conditions wors
e because you weren™t consid
ered a prisoner of war? 
A: I would say about even. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Even, because, you know, the 
Reich
 at that time was already coming, in that 
agony, to an end; so they really
 didn™t know what to do with us. 
Q: You were 15, yes? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: You were 15 years old. 
A: Four Œ 15 - 15, yes, yes. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
148
Q: Yeah, 15. 
A: So, working on that ramp
, we were stealing food so
metimes. I™ll never forget 
when  I ate the pound of butter because I 
Œ I took th e piece, you know, brick of 
butter like this, and the German guard, he
 noticed that, you kno
w, so he followed 
me, and he was waiting, and I went to satis
fy my  physical necessities, and I Œ to 

cover it up, I ate almost a pound of butter. 

Q :  M y  w o rd . 
A: Took a Œ I rememb er one Ukrainian ther
e, he stole some tobacco leaves. And we 
were checked on the end of 
the day, on Œ on our end of
 the day check-up, as we 
were leaving for the camp again, th-the poor Ukrainian, or Russian at that time, 

whatever was Œ he had a cap, and from th
e cap there™s some parts of the leaves 
sticking out. And the Gestapo ask him now,
 did Œ wh at did you steal this time, 
Ivan
? He says, nothing, nothing. And then  he lifted up his Œ 
Q: Cap. 

A: Œ cap, and the leaves started flying 
down, and that was the end of the guy 
because they took him right
 away to the side. Ther
e was a bunker, there was a 
bunker in the middle of the station that looked like a innocent 
build ing like, but the 
walls were about a yard thic
k. During the unexpected aler
ts, when the big boys were

coming over, and they  were coming over by
 numbers, Americans w ere flying these 
fortresses, you know, that you wo
uld pray mo re and more, please. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: They were the white str
eaks of their frozen exhaust. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And this was a massive attack, you know,
 because that was th
e method that they 
were bombing was the carpet method. 
Q: Carpet bombing. 
A: They selected the certain 
[indecipherable]
 target 
[indecipherable]
 leveled off. 
Germans Œ 
Q: So did Œ so did they go into  this bu
nker, the Germans, that you™re descry Œ 
A: They used to save us by
 putting us at the very top.
 The German civilian families 
were at the very safest bottom portion. Th
e transit military, Germans that were in 
transit, you know, going from place to place
 during th e alert, they used to go in  
there. And we were at the very top. So so me of the prisoners of war that signed the 
agreement that they would lik
e to work  for the Œ you know
, as civilians, they were 
there. So they put us in the very top. We 
used to sing songs, and all the things that 
the Germans were getting so  aggravated, 
you know, because we were happy when 
the bombing was going on. Praying mo re 
and mo re. That was one scene. Another

scene was that th Œ there were transports  of cattle. They pulled the cattle trains 
along the ramps, and they sounded the alert. S o metimes alert lasted for three, four, 

or five days. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: So th ey pulled th e trains away, during th
e alert, they pulled 
the trains away so 
they would protect the material, w h atever
 it was there. But when the bombed the 
train, they opened up these cattle cars. Y
ou know, there were so many cows out in 
the field, running aw ay. 

Q: Course. Poor animals. 

A: That we started cutting the meat fromthese cows, and taking it to the barracks, 
and we smeared the smell of the meat a
ll over the place, so
 when the German 
guard s came over with the dogs, the dogs we
re going crazy, because we were hiding 
the meat in the attics of the barracks. Th
en we had the meat for a couple days, 
cooking and eating and so on. You know, this Œ 
Q: And yet the dogs were
 only smelling the blood. 
A: Yeah. They were going crazy. Another 
scene I remember; we were in the movie 
barrack, movie barrack, they were showi
ng us their victorious times. Suddenly, 
explosion took place, a big ex
plosion. These covers that were closing the windows, 
you know, were blown out. We
 saw flames all over the place. We run out of the

barracks, and we saw a plane that was s
hot down , and landed right between the two 
rows of barracks. 

Q: Oh wow. 
A: Yeah, the Germans said, oh finally, we 
shot one of the American planes, you 
know. But we were forced to 
clean the remains next day, 
and the Germans told us to 
bring all these human parts, shoes, whatev
er. Parts that were showing, and I Œ I 
found the German
 belt with the 
[indecipherable]
 you know. And Œ and the human 
leg and th e Œ in the air force boots, you kno
w, they were special boots, heavy, fur-
lined, you know. And they finally recognized 
that this was a German plane. I think 

it was 
ME110
, I think, 
Messersch mitt 110
, two engine plane. Though there was 
sadness among them, to see that there was 
their own plane. What other scene I Œ I 
remember? Oh, this was the 
times when we started Œ th
ey remove us. When the 
front was getting closer and closer, they d
ecided to move us out from the camp , and 
Œ 
Q: So were you there for about half 
a year? How long were you there for? 
A: I™d say

making the gasoline. This was ve
ry, very, let™s say sensitive 
[indecipherable]

Germans used to use a special fog in orde
r to envelop and cover it up. So  we were 
getting th e clouds of the fog sometimes in
to that camp , so we couldn™t breathe. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Anyway, when they were Œ 
Q: Did you speak German? At th

designated for schooling time. So 
I finished the high school in 
Fallingbostel
 til 
1947. I was in military units. 
This was the army of the 
Rhine
. 
Q: So tell me, how did you Œ do you

A: Yeah. 
Q: 
Fallingbostel
. 
A: Yeah, because the war 
was still going on in 
Berlin
. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: That™s right. 

A: So the May eighth. And 
Dö nitz
 was the guy that signed the armistice. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: And this was in 
Flensburg
, that™s 
[indecipherable] 
Q: Yeah. 
A: South of 
Denmark
, maybe a little bit west. 
Q: So my question is, you 
stayed there til ™47, did you
 tra Œ did you want to go 
home, did you try to fi
nd out what had happened to your family? 
A: No, this is Œ this is a de-delicate 
matter, because the allies were try ing to 
convince us to return 
back Œ to Œ to remove us from 
their backs, because there was 
one and a half mi llion refugees, slave laborers in 
Germany
, and the countries of 
their origin were already under Russian oc
cupation. So  we had no place to go. So  
the only thing was saving, let™s say Po lish ne
cks, were that we had the units that 
were under British command, that were 
part of the allied army. The General

Marchuk
(ph), and there was the pa
ratroopers division, the 
So sa bowski s
 that were 
occupying certain parts of the Br
itish zone, was under Polish hands. 
Wilhelmshaven
 was actually this was base of German Œ 
Dönitz
 submarines, 
Wilhelmshaven
. 
Q: Mm-hm, that™s right, mm-hm. 
A: And this was freed by the Poles. So they 
took care of us in a way, that we were 
part of the allied occupation forces of 
Germany
. 
Q: So th ere was no pressure to send you back. 

A: Th Œ no, no pressure to send us back, b
ecause the pressure we simply defied in a 
way, that the free Poles, free armed forces were protecting us. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But among th e Russians, among the Uk rainians, many suicides were committed 

because people didn™t want to
 go back to their paradise, 
the Soviet paradise. There 
were Œ they were decisively against it, a
nd they knew that, according to the Russian 
rule, whoever was taken prisoner, 
he was a ta Œ traitor Œ traitor. 
Q: So these former 
POWs
, former slave laborers of 
Germany
, who had been Œ who 
had been captured  by the Germans, didn™t 
want to go back  because th ey knew that 
they wouldn™t Œ they wouldn™t be 
treated as people who had suffered. 
A: Repats, no, no. 

 
Interview with Thaddeus Gubala  
 
January 27, 2015 
 

 
 
160
Q: No. 
A: The Œ the Russians especially were afraid
 because the propaganda that they were 
fed, you know, that the west if inferior, we
st is so and so, and so and so, you know. 
Suddenly they were 
witnesses to something different.Many Ukrainians were hiding 
among th e Polish 
DP
 camps. Many Russians were trying 
to falsify their papers to Œ 
not to be forced to retu
rn back. There was an agr
eement between, I think, 
Roosevelt
 
and 
Stalin
 to return all the Russians prisoners
 of war back to their homeland. 
Q: But you stayed. Did you try to
 find out what was happening in 
Poland
 with your 
family, with your mo ther and your sister? 
Were you ab le to write to them and fi Œ 

A: No, no, my  mo ther and sist
er were they ro Œ in Œ in 
Œ with me through th e whole 
time. 

Q: Oh, I didn™t realize this. 

A: Yes, I Œ 

Q: So th ey had co me to 
Lehrte
 as well? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: I see, I see. I see. 

A: We were all together til the lib eration, 
and then when finally I Œ I was Œ I went 
through a verification from the Polish gove
rnment, to prove who 
I was, and so on. 
They  imme diately drafted me to the Po lish armed forces.

Q: Got it. Okay . 
A: Okay ? So this was 1947
, when they moved us from 
Fallingbostel
. We were 
demobilized in June, 21
st
 of June, we were demobilized
 by th e Po les, Polish officers 
from the first armored division, that finally
 we became civilians. But we wanted to 
continue our schooling. So the Camp  
Fallingbostel
 and schooling units were 
transferred to 
Lehrte
, near 
Diepholz
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And that™s where I went to 
[indecipherable]
 that™s 
Lyceum
. 
Q: Right. 
A: This is two years, wher
e I got the matriculation, 
matura
(ph). 
Q: Okay , okay. 

A: This was 1949. In ™49, I returned back to 
Fallingbostel
, where my mother, with 
this 
DP
 civilian camp was there. 
And returning back, I got 
job with the milita Œ  Au-
Australian military mission, 
because they needed tran
slators. My English was 
acceptable at that time, so I became an 
interpreter, followed my fa-father™s Œ 
Q: Father™s footsteps, yeah. 

A: And then I worked
 for the military mi Œ Austra
lian military mission, recruiting 
different people to go to
