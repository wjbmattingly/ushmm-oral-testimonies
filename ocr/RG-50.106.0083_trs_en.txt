HEDI PO PE 
November 6, 1997 
 
Question: This is the 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum
 interview with 
Hedi Pope
, conducted by 
Gail Schwartz 
on Novemb er 6
th
, 1997 in 
Alexandria
, 
Virginia
. This interview is part of the muse
um™s project to interview Holocaust 
survivors and witnesses who are also volunt
eers with the museum. This is tape 
number one, side 
A
. What is your full name? 
Answer: My full name is 
Hedi Pope
. It at one time was 
Hedwig
, but that was such 
a mouthful to put on your 
naturalization papers, so I pe
rmanently changed it to just 
Hedi Pope
. I do not use a middle name. 
Q: And what is your family name , your maiden name? 
A: My  maid en  n ame was 
Politzer
. That™s like the 
Pulitzer
 prize, but with an 
O
. 
And it was always 
Hedi Politzer
. As I say, the 
Hedwig
 was not something that I 
especially cherished,
 even as a child. 
Q: And where were you born 
and when  were you born?  
A:
 
I was born March 18
th
, 1920 in 
Vienna
, the capital of 
Austria
. I have an older 
sister, there are just the two of 
us. My parents were both born in 
Vienna
, and they 
were both born in 1887. So we™re really 
going back to th e Victorian age, the Gay 
90s, wh atever you want to call it, and my
 upbringing, I think, was accordingly. 
Q: What is your sister™s 
name, and wh en was she born?

A: My sister
 Ava Œ Eva Œ Ava
, I guess, 
Ava Politzer
, she is not married. She was 
born in 
Vienna 
also in June 1915. 
Q: Tell me a little bit about your parents, 
how Œ and also how far back the family 
goes in 
Vienna
. 
A: Okay. Both my parents came from rath
er prosperous, middle class, I guess you 
would call it. Both grandfathers 
were prominent busin essmen in 
Austria
. 
Grandfather 
Ludwig Politzer
 was born somewhere in the far reaches of the 
Hapsburg 
empire in what is now 
Hungary
, I guess, and came to 
Vienna
 as a very 
young man, to learn the language and to ab
sorb a little culture. That was the thing to  
do fo r young people with any kind of ambition, 
to come to the cap
ital at the time. It 
was, of course, the cultural center, right after 
Paris
 and 
Rome
 and 
London
. He had 
a very interesting gold and silver Œ he was 
a gold and silversmith in a ta Œ in a stre Œ 
on a street that was called 
Papagenogasse
, which is rather Œ rather very Viennese, 
you know, 
P apa  Geno
 is one of the characters in ﬁ
The Magic Flute
.ﬂ And a very 
interesting thing about Grandpa 
Politzer
, we never really knew what kind of an 
artist he was, and in Œ in  eight Œ in 1981, when  the 
Metropolitan
 Mu seum had a 
beautiful exp Œ exhibit of 
Hapsburg 
treasures and Œ and costumes, we suddenly 
stood in front of a big, big 
[indecipherable]
 I call it, exhibit of jewelry that 
Hungarian noblemen wore, and it was made by 
Ludwig Politzer
 in circa Œ it said

circa 1872. So my  sister and I just Œ just 
Œ just couldn™t believe it. I mean, this was 
just an unbelievable thing. We traced 
it down and it is now the property of the 
Imperial
 Museum in 
Budapest
. And to try to get hold
 of somebody who knew 
something about it was Œ this 
was 1981, I said, was impossi
ble. So I™m still trying to 
figure out how I could see it one mo re time. 
But this was a Œ a beautiful thing. Also, 
he has a Œ a very interesting piece 
exhibited in one of the mu seums in 
Vienna
. So 
unbeknownst to us when we lived in 
Vienna
, he was apparently quite Œ quite an 
artist. The business was later 
on carried on after his death by one of the brothers of 
my father™s, but I don™t really know what 
happened. It doesn™t exist any more. The 
other gran dfather also 
came from somewhere in 
Hungary
, as a very young man, 
about 15 years old, to learn something besi
des Hungarian. And he turned  out to be a 
very well-known businessman. He  had the mo
st Œ best known haberdashery, I guess 
you would call it, on wh at would be the 
Fifth 
Avenue of 
Vienna
, called 
Kärntner 
Strasse
. And once or twice a year he went to  
Lo ndon
 and 
Paris 
for buying 
materials and Œ and Œ and fo
r made-to-order suits for men and women. It was called 
the English fleet, the 
Englisch-Flotte
, it was v ery well known, and it was, until 
about 10 years ago, carried 
on by a mu ch younger child of
 hi Œ much younger than 
my  mo ther™s child, but that™s a long family
 story th at I don™t think I have time to 
relate. Well, anyway, they we
re both very prosperous. 
My father™s family had Œ 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

there were two sisters and five brothers, seven. And my  father, 
Oscar
 
Politzer
 was 
the youngest. My mother™s 
famil y , there were two older siste rs an d one younger 
brother. My mother™s name was 
Marie
, but she was all Œ always 
Mit zi
, little 
Mitzi
 
because she was tiny and very, very delicate.
 And all she really knew how to do was 
play the piano. That was 
the thing to do. And both households had a cook and a 
maid, and in my mother™s 
family there was a mademois
elle that came several 
afternoons a week because you had to le
arn another language, abso lutely. And my  
father™s family with the five
 boys especially , there was a sort of a tutor, another Œ 
another teacher who saw that homework wa
s being done by thes
e Œ by this big 
family. I Œ I think this is important to Œ to
 realize how very much
 entrenched this Œ 
both families were in 
Vienna
. They were socially and fi
nancially very, very much 
Viennese. 
Q: And what kind of work
 did your father do? 
A: My father was, I guess you™d call it a 
businessman. He was supposed to Œ to, 
with his brother-in-law, my  mo ther™s 
brother, take over the business from my  
maternal grandfather, but things happened. Grandpa 
Berg er
 was his name, was 
widowed er Œ er Œ ma Œ at age 60, and re
married a much, much 
younger woman, to 
the great distress of the children. And they
 had another child, and that other child, of 
course, was inheriting th e business, instead 
of the son an d son-in-law and that was

that. So my father had Œ it™s hard to Œ to
 translate it. He Œ he represented foreign 
firms.  He was a businessman, an d busi
ness was not good. We
™re talking Œ my 
parents were married in 19
14, beginning of the war. And 
the time between the wars 
was economically very bad in 
Euro pe
. So  we had everything a child would need. 
And besides, you didn™t talk business with y
our ch ildren. I was really not aware of 

what my father did. I wouldn™t say I didn™t
 care, but you just di
dn™t discuss it with 
your children. 
Q: Did your mother work? 
A: No, Mo th er did not work , and it™s Œ it™s 
interesting, because she was a very, very 
talented and very  smart woman, but girls of
 this age in that level of society just 
didn™t work. There was Œ she played the 
piano very  well, and I guess she knew how 
to cook, because she 
had to learn it. But then we al
ways had a maid or somebody 
else who cooked, so Mo ther didn™t Œ I mean, she brought up my  sister and me, but 
that was about it.  
Q: How religious was your family? 
A: Not at all. Not at all. 

Q: Did you celebrate any religio us holiday s? 
A: Not at all. We had a Christmas tree, and the 24
th
 of December was sort of a 
family reunion. We had a Christmas tree w
ith  real candles. And there were always

two big pitchers of water st
anding nearby, because we al
ways had one or two mine 
Œ little minor fir-fires. But that Œ that was it.  
Q: Was Christmas a religious holid ay fo r you, or Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ a civil hol Œ a civil holiday ? 

A: It was strictly a civil holiday . We didn™t go to  church or midnis Œ mass, or 

anything like that. 
Q: Did you ever go to  any synagogue services? 
A: Very rarely. I remember one wedding of
 a cousin, much older cousin, that I 
attended, but that was about it. Which se
ems strange, but that
™s the way it was. 
Q: Well now, let™s talk about you. Let™s 
talk about your childh
ood, and also your 
neighborhood where your family lived. Wa
s it a mixed neighborhood of Jews and 
non-Jews when  you were growing up? 

A: You™re asking me a question I really 
don™t know how to answer, because I don™t 
know. Even though you hear
 a lot and read a lot abou
t rising anti-Semitism, I was 
not aware of it. I had friends Œ I had Jewish
 friends and I had, of course, the state 
religion, so to speak, in 
Austria
 was Catholic. So mo st people were Catholics, but 
there were some Protestants. And you just
 didn™t pay too mu ch attention to where 
people went on Sundays, or if they went at all.

Q: What kind of school did you
 go to as a young child? 
A: I went to four years of elemen tary school, and then Œ 
Q: Was this a public school? 
A: Public school, yes, definitely public sc
hool, very close by to my  house. I walked 
Œ I could walk by my self. And after four 
years of elementary school, you had to 
decide wh ether you wanted to go to  an
 eight year gymnasium, which was high 
school, or just four years of Œ which was called 
Hauptschule
. Most of the time, if 
you just didn™t make very good grades, a
nd couldn™t really do very  well, you went 
to 
Hauptschule
. Or if there was no money at all 
Œ cause you did pay a little bit for 
gymnasium. And children went to 
Hauptschule
 if they wanted to follow a trade. 
It™s th-the sy Œ the school system is very
 ve Œ was very different and still is very 
different from he Œ here in the 
U.S.
 I went to a eight year gymnasium, which was 
very strict, very difficult and very, very 
cut and dry academic, I would say. And I™m 
Œ I™m glad I had the good education I had. 
Q: While you were going to  school, I assu
me you had no religious
 training at Œ at 
that time. Did you have any hobbies 
or other interests, besides school? 
A: From age five on, I danced . I was gon
na be a dancer, and I was gonna have a 
dance studio, somewhere. And that was th
at, and the opportunitie
s, of course, in 
Vienna
 were tremendous. Our household was 
very much infused 
with music. We

had a beau tiful 
Bösendorfer
. That™s one of the big, big,
 beautiful pianos we had. 
Mother played quite 
a bit. My sister had piano lessons, seemed forever. And Mo ther 
tried piano lessons for me, but I just coul
dn™t sit still long enough. So I Œ I had Œ 
Mother was my teacher for 
about three years and then 
we both gave up, and I™m 
truly sorry I did, but I gave up. So I Œ I 
danced  two, three afternoons a week. You 
know, school was from about Œ well, em Œ 
elementary school it was from eight to 
12. Then  in gymnasium you we
nt to school every day fr
om eight to one, and it c Œ 
also on Saturdays, so the Œ 
the dance classes came in th
e afternoon. And very  early 
in life, I did a lot of performing. That was 
really what I Œ what 
I loved. One of my  
teachers was a Œ one of the soloists at the 
Staatsoper
, and she had a studio on the 
side, and was also often asked to  choreograph for the 
Burgtheater
, which was the 
dramatic stage Œ this dramatic, state supp
orted stage. And there I had all sorts of 
opportunities. I got paid so
mething, which amounts to nowadays probably fo r about 
10 cents. But at the time it was Œ it was grea
t to have a little Œ little money to save, 
and I usually saved it up to go on a skiing 
trip, because that was the other Œ I would 
n Œ wouldn™t know whether it was a hobb
y, but everybody sk ied, and we also 
skated. I Œ we had membership to one of th
e ice skating rinks. And then ev ery year, 
that was later on in gymnasium, the whol
e school, or those who co uldn™t ski well, 
they had to stay home, went somewhere for 
a week, into one of 
the youth hostels in

the 
Alps
, and ju st looking back on it, this wa
s probably  the mo st beautiful, best 
times we ever had.  
Q: What language did you spea
k with your parents at home? 
A: Well, we spoke German, and although people from 
Berlin
 don™t always want to 
admit that Austrians 
speak German, it is 
Volksdeutsche
. So that was the language 
we Œ I had seven years of French  in ha Œ 
in high school, in gymn asium, four years 
of Latin and about two or three years of En
glish. So we Œ tha-th
at was very much Œ 
everybody had to take languages. And Fren
ch was really usually the first foreign 
language. Now it™s Œ it™s English, but in 
those days it was always French was the 
first foreign language. 
Q: Were your parents, or maybe specifica
lly your father, very politically oriented, 
politically involved? 
A: No, not at all. At least that™s the wa
y it seemed to me. I have no way of Œ of 
knowing, but no, my  answer would be no. I Œ my  Œ my  mo ther™s brother 
George
, he 
was two or three years younger than my  
mo ther, was terribly proud of his Wo rld 
War I record. He was in the cavalry, and it wa
s hard to get into the cavalry. I don™t 
know wh ether you had to pay so mebody 
to get in, or it was the uniform, that 
beautiful red pants, red trousers and blue j
acket that was expensive, but he was very 
proud to have been in  the 
cavalry. And was wound
ed in  World War I, he had a very

badly crippled hand from Œ from a wound 
in World War I. And later on, after the 
war was over, he joined a party called the 
Ligity-misten
(ph). They were Œ I don™t 
know whether it was a political party or just
 like an association, people who wanted 
to have th e 
Habsburg 
Œ the 
Ha bsburgs
 back. And later on, when  the Nazis 
marched in, that was Œ was very bad. I™ll come to that later. 
Q: Was your father Zionistic at all? 

A: Not at all, not at all. Religion had Œ 
had absolutely noth ing Œ no Œ no impact on 
me. 

Q: Did you feel Jewish ? 

A: No, I never did. And I Œ 
Q: Did you know th at you were born Jewish? 
A: Yes, yes, that I knew, but it was just so
mething that was just sort of glossed over, 
I guess you would call it. It™s hard to believe, but that™s the way it was. 

Q: What kind of relationship 
did you have with your pare
nts? Was i t the kind that 
you could talk things over with, did you
 have especially close relationship? 
A: Well, I think the relationship was close, 
yes, but close for these years, for Œ for 
the Œ for the years in the Œ in the 20s. Pr
obably not for now. I™m Œ I™m very close 
with my  daughter now, mu ch closer 
than I ever was with my mother.  
Q: What about your relationship wh en
 you were a child, with your sister? 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

13
A: Well, we Œ we fought, like all sister
s do, but basically it was a friendship and 
we™re still very good friends. 
Q: Now let™s move to 1933. You are 13 years old, and 
Hitler
 has come into power 
in 
Germany
. Do  you recall Œ okay, obviously you were quite young Œ any ch anges 
that you were aware of when he f Œ from 19
 Œ in the early Œ yo
u know, 1933, in the 
beginning? 

A: Well, I want to go back
 few Œ few years before th
at. We talked about the 
Soltsis
(ph) and the Nazis. The 
Soltsis
(ph) were the social democrats, and the Nazis 
were Œ you know, the 
word Nazi comes from 
Nationalsozialisti sc he Deutsche 
Arbeiterpartei
. So there was this talk, and of c
ourse children pick up things. So  
neither one was particularly good, but the 
social demo crats were the leading party 
after World War I. And I rememb er vaguely th
ere was a kind of a Œ almost a little 
revolution. I think it was about ™27 - 19 27. Maybe I™m thinking of 1931, I™m not 

sure. There was a big new 
build ing develo pment where 
a lot of people could get 
very low rent apartments, and they trie
d to have a little revolution against the 
somewhat authoritarian Christian democrat Œ 

Q: [sneezes] Excuse me. 
A: Œ government at the time. So I Œ I™m 
Œ I was aware that there was something Œ 
something going on. This was in 
™31. 1933, yes, we heard about
 Hitler
, but that was 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

next door. That was Œ that was far away. It™s
 hard to believe th
is nowadays, but you 
know, we didn™t have television. We hadju st gotten a radio, and co mmunications 
just weren™t Œ and besides, I was 13 year
s old, I had too many other things I Œ I 
wanted to  think about and do. 
So we Œ yes, we knew ab out 
Hitler
, but that was 
about it. Then things became more serious. 
In 1934, and I remember that very well, 
that the Chancellor 
Dollfuss
 Œ I don™t think one even 
knows the name here, was 
murdered. He was the Œ the 
Austrian chancellor. And it 
was very obvious that the 
Nazis from Œ the German Nazis were behind 
that terrible murder. It was in July, and 
I was on vacation at one of my aunt™s v
illas on the lake. And we were very, very 
worried about what was really happening
 there. But then 
that calmed down. 
Dollfuss
 successor was 
Kurt von Schuschnigg
, and he was a very, very different 
kind of chancellor. I 
remember Chancellor 
Dollfuss
, he was a very short man, he 
was just five foot tall, and he was the bu
tt of a lot of jokes. But he was a very 

popular ma n, he had a great deal of rappor
t with the Œ with the people. And th e Œ 
this new man, 
von Schuschnigg
 was a kind of a college professor type. Very  
serious, seemingly not a whole 
lot of sense of humor, an d he was also at the time, 
the head of the 
Heimwehr
. 
Heimwehr
 was sort of a militia type party, it was a 
different party. It was somewh
ere between the Nazis and the 
Soltsis
(ph). And a lot 
of the 
Heim wehr
 Œ 
Heimwehr
 people were aristocrats that at one time of course 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

15
were for the return of the 
Habsburg s
. So he definitely lack
ed popular appeal. And I 
think he Œ he had absolutely 
no way of communicating with 
Hitler
, he wasn™t even 
trying. And he was the wrong type to ever me et up with 
Hitler
. This is Œ this was 
1934. The Œ 1936, of course, was the year
 of the Olympics, which the mu seum so 
very, very  beautifully, I tho
ught that was a marvelous decision, whoever made it, to 
have that year show other Olympics, becaus
e I remember that ve
ry well. I was very 
much into athletics and of 
course we realized that 
Hitler
 used this as a tremendous 
propaganda tool, the Œ the Olympic games.
 A nd we were so, so taken by this 
beautiful black man 
Jesse Owens
. He was Œ but it was Œ it was very, very Œ there 
were several Austrian competitors, one or 
two of them were Je
wish, who were not 
allowed to participate the last mo ment. So 
it was a very, very strained. It started Œ it 
started to be very, very strained. 

Q: When  
Hitler 
ca me t o  power in 1933
, and as the year star
ted to go on, did you 
yourself think mo re about 
being Jewish, or did that not enter your mind? I™m 
talking, you know, even up
 thro ugh th e ™36 Olympics. 
A: No, this Œ this didn™t really Œ I don™t 
know, I Œ I Œ it™s funny that I have no Œ no 

feeling, no Œ no memo ries that I said oh 
dear, you know, what™s gonna happen? Just 
not at all. This really didn™t happen until af
ter 1938. I had in s Œ in school, of course 
there was a Œ we knew that there was 
an underground. Th
e un d e rg ro und  N a zi

movement started when 
Schuschnigg
 came in because he Œ he did a lot of Œ lot of 
really very, very awkward things. He trie
d to outlaw the National Socialist party in 
Austria
, and that was the wrong th
ing to do. They  went unde
rground there. So right 
Œ right on my  right side, we Œ we sat in Œ in
 Œ in school, in sort of desks that were 
three or four. The girl on my right side, 
I knew wore a little swastika on her lapel, 
on th e underside of her lapel. The girl on my
 left, her father was 
in the military, and 
he was to be the Austrian attaché in 
Berlin
. So you know, I had a little bit of a 
political fallout there on Œ on either side of
 Œ but we were Œ we were friends. I think 
the girl who wore the swastika on the Œ on
 the side of the lapel knew that I knew 
she wore it. But that was alright, you know
, it Œ and we also knew that there were 
certain Œ certain professors, certain teache
rs who we knew were
 Œ were Nazis, but 
they Œ th ey didn™t make any Œ an y differenc
e, they didn™t treat us any different. It 
was Œ it was interestin g. When I think back of it, there w as very little of this polit Œ 
it didn™t come down to the youngste
rs, let™s say, ti Œ our age group. 
Q: So you yourself neve
r, up until 1938, you yourself
 never experienced any 
difficulty, any anti-Semitic overtones? 

A: Not at all. Not at all that I Œ that
 I can remember. Maybe there was, there 
probably  was, underg round. Bu t a teenager ju
st didn™t pay too mu ch attention to it. I 
Œ I went to a very nice dance school. Th
at™s Œ when I say th
at, it™s the social

dancing, the same Œ same school that my 
mother went to, and he™s still there, th e 
school is still there, only not th Œ the 
man is long dead, bu
t there you know, you 
would have Œ would have said
 you Œ you Œ perhaps there 
were any Œ any differences 
who could come into this class or that cl
ass. But I just don™t 
remember that there 
was any discrimination like th
is, I just truly don™t. 
Q: And you didn™t see any ev idences on the 
street or wit h  businesses. What about 

your father™s work? 
A: No, my father™s work ac
tually, I think he had some 
work with German firms, I 
don™t know what happened there. I Œ I rea
lly, as I said before
, there was very little 
business talk, and children were Œ it was just
 like Œ like not in front of the children 
kind of a Œ kind of an attitude, which seem
s strange, but that™s Œ that™s the way, at 
least in my family was the way. 
Q: Well, now let™s move through Œ thro
ugh 1937, and now to March ™38, unless 
there™s anything in 1937
 you wanted to cover. 
A: Not particularly. I think there we
re Œ there were signs that Œ that 
Hitler
 Œ it 
seems to me that Œ that Mr. 
Dollfuss
 and Mr. 
Schuschnigg
 were good friends with 
Mussolini
. That was of course on our south, 
you know, we were 
in between. And 
Mussolini 
was Œ was very friendly to 
Austria
 and he Œ the way I Œ I read some  of 
the stuff now in retrospect, after almo
st 60 years, he tried  to Œ to tell 
Hitler
 to stay

out of 
Austria
, because I think he Œ he 
want Œ he was afraid of 
Hitler
 like 
everybody else. So when Œ when 
Hitler 
made moves to Œ wh ich he did, to invite 
Schuschnigg
 to come to see him, 
Mussolini
 told him that he 
thought that was a  
mistake. A nd he also told 
Schuschnigg 
not to  go. Bu t I don™t know what happened 
in 1937, but I know 1938, earl
y 1938, January, February, 
Schuschnigg
 finally had 
to go to 
Berchtesgaden
. And I remember th at Œ that period very well, because I 
was in my last year of high school. And th
ere was a sort of an unwritten law, at least 
it was Œ my parents insisted that I di
dn™t go to any of the big carnival 
[indecipherable]
 it was called, until I was a senior 
in high school. So this was my Œ 
my time to go to Œ to balls, and Œ and 
the political situati
on seemed so Œ so 
uncertain and so  Œ it was so, so gray, and so
, so unpleasant that I was afraid they 
were all going to  spoil my  fun. But I did manage to go do some of the dances. But I 

do remember the time that 
Schusch nigg
 went to 
Berchtesgaden
, I remember that Œ 
that very well, because even  though we only had radio, it was all given over the 
radio and there was also something calle
d Œ here it was called March of Time, I 
think. You went to the movies for just
 about 45 minutes, and you had the news 
there. So we Œ we got a lot of that thro
ugh Œ th rough th ese films. And there were 
reports of how, for ab out two hours 
Hitler
 just raved and ranted
 and would not take 
Œ accept anything that 
Schuschnig g
 su ggested. And 
Schuschnigg 
at the time h ad a

minister Œ I don™t know minist
er of wh at, but his name was 
Guido Schmid t
, who 
was really a Nazi. But he came with 
Schusch nigg
 and kind of eg ged him on and 
say oh, come on, give in, make a few little
 Œ little allowances. Bu
t it was a totally Œ 
total disaster, that meeting that he had with 
Hitler
. He came home and if I 
remember right, I think it was a Œ it was a se
cret to the Austrian population that he 
was actually there. I don™t think we knew
 about it until he came back. And it was a 
Œ I mean, we were told 
that it was no good, and 
Schuschnigg
 suggested a plebiscite. 
And 
Hitler 
said absolutely not. But 
Schuschnigg
 did it anyway. And that truly was 
the straw that broke the camel™s
 back because that was just 
Œ Hitler
 was just 
waiting for Œ for an oc
casion. So on March 11
th
, he Œ his army  crossed the border. 
And I remember that extremely well because
 I was at a d ance rehearsal. See, by 
then I was Œ I was 17 going on 18 and I 
really Œ I was very serious about my 
dancing and this was gonna be a production of 
Faust
, second part of 
Faust
, under 
Max Reinhard t
, and that Œ of course he was the Œ 
the Œ the god of the theater at the 
time. And this was Friday evening and th
e rehearsal was called off. And of course 
that whole thing was called off because 
Reinhardt
 was one of the first that crossed 
the border; he was smart, he left, F riday the 11
th
. And then Sa
turday the 
Luftwaffe
 
flew over 
Vienna
 and Sunday the 13
th
, 
Hitler 
came in. And I will never forget that, 
because even though we were 
told not to go da Œ out on 
the street, o f course we Œ

we young people wanted to see, no matter Œ 
whether we™re for or 
against, but you Œ 
you wanted to see, and this Sunday  night, I 
had tickets to go to the opera. I had a Œ a 
boyfriend at the time who was in his one ye
ar of army duty, military duty, and he 
had cheap tickets, or free tic
kets, probably . Well, you c
ouldn™t Œ you couldn™t cross 
the street in  front of the opera, I mean 
th Œ the ring Œ there™s the Œ there™s a big 
avenue that goes around the old town, ca
lled the ring. And all along the ring are the 
beautiful buildings, like the op
era, and the Œ the parliament, and the university and 
the 
Burgtheater
 and all that. Well, people stood 10 
deep to see the parade, so we 
never made it to the opera. In fact, at th
e opera, people were hangi
ng out fo Œ of the 
windows, and it was sort of stormed by th
e Œ by th e people who wanted to see the 
parade, and of course, 
Hitler
 himself, he was standing up in car with his right 
handed lifted, and so  forth. So it was rather
 Œ rather impossible thing to  erase out of 
your head , the noise Œ 

Q: What were your thoughts when  you 
Œ you Œ you said you
 saw the parade. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And what were your thoughts? 

A: I don™t know. I don™t know whether we 
thought that we Œ we had heard that the 
last few years, Jews really had a hard time in 
Germany
. Their businesses were  
either closed, or they were 
not allowed to do this and that
. But people still Œ still had

a life in 
Germany
. It wasn™t the Œ the horror Œ the 
Holocaust really  didn™t start until 
several years later. So we figured well, 
Austria
 Œ because we always Œ the 
Austrians always felt oh, it won™t happen
 here, you know, that™s the Austrian 
temperament. But I don™t know whether Œ 
whether I Œ I was very busy trying to  
finish high school. That™s Œ that™s my feeling now, but I don™t know at the time. I 
think my parents were Œ were terribly undone
 by it. But they too felt, oh well, yes, 
the kids should probably leave, but we™ll 
somehow stick it out. It was that attitude. 
Q: You said the day befo
re was Saturday and the 
Luftwaffe 
came flying by. What 
were your thoughts then ? 
A: I don™t know. I s Œ I Œ I was told to
 stay home, and everybody stayed home, 
because it was Œ by then you really had thefeeling Œ see we Œ we thought that there 

was gonna be a fight. We thought there was gonna be a war. We had a small 

Austrian army, but I think they were totally
 overwhelmed by the thought of the Œ of 
the German army and the 
Luftwaffe
, so that they decided well, we better not have a 
bloodbath. I think th at was th
e idea. So one stayed home. 
Q: All right, you™ve seen 
Hitler 
go by in the car, and Œ  
A: From a distance. 
Q: Œ from a distance, and th en what happened next?

A: Well, we didn™t have school for a we
ek. You know how kids are. And it was my  
birthday. And th at was the birthday I don™t rememb er, because I think everybody 
else forgot about it. It was very, very Œ we
 Œ we didn™t know. It was a Œ it was a in 
limbo kind of a thing. There was a lot of Œ lo
t of parades, lot of 
oh, you have to join 
the 
Hitler
 youth. But of course, you know, we 
wouldn™t. We wouldn™t even think 
about it. It was a very Œ 

Q: Why wouldn™t you th ink about it? 
A: Well, because, first of a
ll I Œ you Œ you had to declar
e that you had eight Gentile 
Œ Aryan it was called Œ gran dparents. And then I know a lot of people who did not 
join the 
Hitler 
youth. You didn™t Œ you didn™t have to. You were told you had to, 
but if you didn™t join , you 
had to  explain why. So it was a Œ I think that was 
probably the first feeling of oh, we better ha
ve Œ we have to leave. If you Œ if you 
not part of the 
Hitler
 youth, you couldn™t do anything. So
 I can™t really answer that 
question, I don™t know what I felt. As I 
said, I was busy. End 
of Œ end of high 
school was a very Œ it was very difficult. There was something called 
Ma tu ra
 
which was oral and written exams, very diffi
cult. It was a sort of a summary of your 

Œ your high school years, and we had to study
 hard . So we still were going to finish 
this. So that week of vacation, which I gue
ss it was, I don™t know just exactly what I 

did. I Œ I™m sorry, I can™t tell you.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
Hedi Pope
. This is tape number one, side
 B
. 
And we were talking about Œ we 
had gotten up to the time when 
Hitler
 had come in 
and you had been  a Œ 
you said, a half a kilometer away
. Did you start to feel more 
Jewish from then on? 
A: No, I don™t think I did. The Œ I Œ I still 
saw my friends. I sa-sat next to the girl 
who now wo re the swastika on the outside of
 her lapel. And school continued. This 
was March, we were going to have our 
Ma tura
, that™s those orals and written 
exams in June. We had to wo
rk  hard. One of our favorite professors was gone. She 
was the German literature lady. She was 
Jewish, so she had 
to go. We had a Œ 
Q: How did you react to that, knowing that
 she had to go because she was Jewish? 
A: Well, you better not react it, because if
 you expressed yourse
lf to somebody, you 
were not certain what that other person 
Œ how that other person would react, and 
perhap s tell somebody that 
Hedi
 said such and such, and 
then that could hurt my  
family. 

Q: How did you know it could 
possibly hurt your family?

A: Well, we were told that you Œ right after March 13
th
, there were quite a few 
people wh o quickly  disappeared. We weren™
t sure just where to. Some of them 
voluntarily just left. Some of them left 
with a passport, some
 of them without. 
Others were taken to concen tration camp s. 
This was Œ this was rather Œ you Œ you Œ 
you realized very  soon that things have ch
anged and you had to 
be careful. Careful 
is the word. So you just 
accepted it. We had somebody else take her place. The 
principal was replaced, because he wa
s part Œ he was high up in the 
Heimwehr
; that 
was the patriotic front, or whatev er you wa
nt to call it. And he was replaced by, 
interesting enough, one of the regular t
eachers who everybody kn
ew that he Œ she 
was in the underground Nazi party. So  th
at™s Œ those were the changes that took 
place. Also, as we came in after th at one
 week of vacation, we saw a picture of 

Hitler
 in the classroom, all the classrooms had pictures of 
Hitler
. And every class 
started, you know, different teacher come
s in and we had to stand up and say 
heil 
Hitler
. 
Q: Did you do that? 

A: Yes, of course. And that™s another ques tion I always get, and I feel like oh dear, 

what kind of a characterless perso n ? But yo
u know, I wouldn™t be here if I would 
not have raised my  right arm.

Q: Were you able to talk about your concer
ns and your fears with
 your parents, or 
did they  discuss this with you? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, we discu
ssed it. And the Œ the idea was to Œ oh yes, you ch ildren, 
you just must go, and for me it was a perfe
ct time to leave or do so mething else. I 
was possibly gonna go to university, I 
don™t know wh at I was gonna do after 

Matu ra
. So  we started corresponding with tw o cousins we had in  the 
U.S.
 
Q: Ju-Just a moment, we™ll get to that. 
What was it like for you to see a swastik a? 
A: Well, it made you mad. I Œ 
I don™t know what else to sa
y, I Œ because if Œ if you 
said some Œ again, I have to repeat, if you 
Œ if you said something against it, or if 
you s Œ I don™t know, people spit on it or 
some, they were immediately taken aw ay. 
I mean, it was wi Œ life was dangerous. And I 
think our parents prob
ably told us to, 
when  we go out, be careful. And if somebody comes towards you and Œ and a 

perfect stranger says 
heil Hitler
, you™d better say 
heil Hitler
 back. 
Q: Did you yourself have any f
earful experiences on the street? 
A: No, not at all. I think partially becaus
e it was Œ I was very blonde and blue eyed. 
Q: Uh-huh. Did you have any special iden tity papers, or your family, saying that 

you were Jewish at that time? 
A: No, not at all, no.

Q: Y-Y-You said that people started to le
ave, that Œ those who could. Were you ev 
Œ ever aware of a man named 
Adolf Eichmann
? 
A: Of what? 
Q: Of a ma n named 
Ado l f Eichma nn
. 
A: No, no, not at all. No, we knew of Œ of 
Hitler
 and 
Goebbels
 and 
Goering 
and 
Himmler
. 
Eichmann
 I Œ I Œ we Œ that name, I Œ I didn™t know until they were 
looking for him in 
Argentina
, I think. No. 
Q: All right, now you said your parents star
ted to take measures to get you and your 
sister out of the country? 
A: We had Œ we had cousin s who had come to 
Newark
, or to the une Œ the 
U.S.
 and 
settled in 
Newark
. There were two women, there was cousins on my father™s sid e, a 
good bit older than we were, very indepe
ndent ladies. One of them Œ this Œ I™m 
talking about the 20s Œ got a doctorate at 
Heidelberg
. Now that was very, very 
progressive. The other one was a x-ray technician. She went to 
Sweden
. She just 
had had it with 
Austria
, so she up and went to 
Sweden
. And then  the Œ the one who 
Œ th-the one who went to 
Sweden
 then went to the 
U.S.
 This was about 1936 or 
1937. Sh e was just a very adventurous person. The other one, with  a docto rate from 
Heidelberg
, got married and had a young ch ild, 
and followed her sister. She Œ this 
woman with Œ then  divorced, followed her sister to 
Newark
, 
New Jersey
, and the

two of them eked out a 
living, so to speak, in 
Newark
,
 New Jersey
. And when  we 
wrote to them, they sa
id, by all means come. 
Q: How soon after 
Hitler
 came into 
Austria
 did you Œ did your 
folks write to them? 
A: Oh, I imagine was probably June, July, 
somewhere there. Not 
really sure just 
when. One thing we did right away, and it 
was a Œ it was a network kind of a thing. 
Everybody went to the 
United States
 embassy and got a quota numb er. We had no 
idea what it was, but everybody
 should have one. In orde
r to Œ to emigrate, you had 
to have a quota numb er; quot
as being very different by co
untries. And the Austrian 
quota was very good, meaning the 
U.S. 
didn™t mind Austrians coming in. But the 
Italian quota was not very good, and 
God forb id if you were born in 
Hungary
, they 
wanted Œ like two people a y
ear they accepted. Was a very
 interesting th ing because 
I don™t know whether this is still that 
way, but you Œ you n
eeded a quota number. 
And if you wanted to  know
, you know, how many a month, they  didn™t really tell 
you at the embassy. But I rememb er at th
e time they said oh well, your number 
should come up around the firs
t of the year. So this wa
s, you know, a Œ ™38, so 
maybe by ™39 we could Œ we 
could think of it. But I reme
mber very well just stand 
in line at the 
U.S.
 embassy in 
Vienna
 and get a quota number.

Q: Did you see any signs on Jewish shops 
saying that they were Jewish shops, or 
were you aw are of businesses that were 
closed? Did you see a
ny measures starting 
to take place once 
Hitler
 Œ once the 
anschluss 
occurred? 
A: Yes, yes, we saw that, but to the extent 
of Œ not yet. This Œ this was to come, but 
not Œ not yet. Quite a few business people, wh
at happened is they
 perhaps Œ if they 
had an  employee who was Aryan that they 
could trust, kind of put it into his/her 
hands, and that way protecte
d themselves. T h ere were a lo
t of ways of Œ of getting 
around th at. Then  they needed doctors badly 
at the time , so the Jewish doctors could 
stay because they were
 needed. So there was a lot of 
case by case, it was this Œ this 
sort of thing. 
Q: In April, it™s been written that some 
Jews were takento 
the local amusement 
park and assaulted. Are you aware of that? To the pra Œ the 
prater
, 
p Œ p-r-a-t-e-r
? 
A: No, I™m Œ I™m Œ I don™t know. I wasn™t 
Œ it was probably true, but I was Œ I was 
not aware of that. 

Q: So you have graduate Œ 
when  was your graduation? 
A: All right, we g Œ w-we graduated and that
 was kind of interesting. There were so 
many parades going on, and so many Œ so 
many different things
 that we did not 
have to go through th e orals. And th at™s un
believable, I mean, if Œ if Œ if I can say 
there™s one Œ one good thing came out of 
it, that I didn™t have orals for my  
Matura
. 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

That the written exams were in Œ in mathem
atics, and Latin, literature and French, I 
think. And they were, you kn
ow, five hour exams. You 
Œ you got a Œ got a Œ a title, 
a theme, and you had to Œ to write a paper on it. So they Œ we had to go through 
that, but the orals Œ and then th at was su
ch a relief, it was wonderful. And we had a 
Œ there was a tradition of having a 
Matura
 fire. And th at meant you went to a 
restaurant, and met one more time all the 
Œ all the peop Œ this was an all girls™ 
school, so there were about 30 of us. And 
I guess you call it a roast here, but one of 
Œ one or two of them wrote a newspaper about it, and said the mo st awful things 
about their teachers. But it was you Œ it was 
a totally, totally good
 affair, with Œ you 
couldn™t have guessed what was going on 
around Œ around us. This was in June 
then, at the end.  

Q: Did you talk, or confide in Œ confid e 
with your sister a
nd Œ your concerns, or 
your fears about wh at was happening? 

A: I don™t remember. I Œ we 
probably did, yeah , uh-huh. 
Q: What was she doing? She™s a Œ was olde
r than you, so what
 was she doing while 
you were finishing up? 
A: Okay , she had done her 
Matura
 five years Œ four years before I did. And then 
took business courses, and went to 
Paris
 for a year as a receptionist at the 
Hotel 
Des Saint Peres
, which still exists. So she spoke fl
uent French, which she still does.

And then  came home and really didn™t know wh
at she was gonna do. It seems to me 
she worked for sa Œ for one of
 the book stores, as Œ I don™t know what she did, but it 
was no Œ no specialty. I da Œ I had this da
nce specialty, she didn™t really have a 
specialty. 

Q: Did you ever Œ or di Œ di
d your father talk about ever
 going to  this central office 
for Jewish immigration in 
Vienna
?  
A: I Œ my father was a little bit more forw
ard looking than my mother. She, I don™t 
think, could imagine herself leaving 
Vienna
. My father started taking Span ish, and 
English and plumbing. He was Œ he was good 
with this sort of thing. And actually 
the Œ the line of Œ of pre Œ representations 
he had with other firms was in the line of 
bathroom fixtures and that sort of thing, pl
umbing type of thing.
 So  he Œ he took Œ 
he took co urses in that. And of course hi
s Œ his business more or less came  to a 
standstill, and I Œ I to this 
day wonder how we could affo
rd the rent, and the food, 
really. I imagine there were some savings
, I don™t know. We 
had Œ I had a very  
wealthy uncle and aunt, sister of my moth
er™s, who didn™t have any children, I think 
they help ed us out at the time. I really 
don™t know. Ag ain, it was something that you 
didn™t discuss with your child
ren, so I Œ I™m not aware of Œ of Œ of what happened. 
But the Œ they definitely tu
rned to Œ turn
ed our thoughts to 
getting out. I didn™t

finish my story about what we were going 
to do about coming to 
this country. These 
two sisters were very willing to take care of us, but Œ 
Q: What Œ what were their names? 
A: Okay, of course they were both born 
Politzer
, older brother of my father™s. And 
Helen
, the one that went to 
Sweden
 and came over here, never married, so her Œ 
she stayed a 
Politzer
. And the other one™s name was 
Freid
(ph), and that™s an 
interesting story, but I don™t think I™ll ha
ve to tell Œ the time
 to tell about her. 
Q: Her first name? 
A: 
Anna
 and 
Helen
. And they Œ when you 
sh Œ when  you have 
Œ want Œ have some 
Œ somebody to immigrate, you have to fu
rn ish an affidavit. There was a Œ a new 
thing too, the quota and affidavit we had,
 th ose were new wo rds in our vocab ulary. 
And these two ladies did not have enough 
money to Œ didn™t earn en ough to  Œ to 
say, we™ll take care of these. So we had 
to find somebody w
ith mo re money. And 
my  mo ther had some old friends, two bach
elor brothers who I think grew up in 
Vienna
, that she wrote to. And this was very
 brave of her, because I don™t think 
she™d heard from them, I mean, I d on™
t know how many years. And they 
immediately answered, says yes, by all means,
 we™ll let you have an  affidavit. And I 
think it was the idea they had 
to do it with these two cousins, because Œ here again, 
this is interesting about the 
U.S.
, two bachelor brothers could not bring in  two

young ladies. Which makes sense, I guess.
 So between the Œ this was a joint 
affidavit, between the two men, who ha
d en ough money, and the two wo men who 
had all the family love you could wish for, 
that said okay, we™ll take care of these 
two young women.  
Q: You™ve graduated from gymnasi
um, and then what did you do? 
A: I graduated and we 
went for two or thr Œ 

Q: Excuse me for interruptin
g. Was there any mention of 
Hitler
 at graduation 
ceremonies? 

A: Not that I remember. Not th
at I remember at all. As 
I said, it was very Œ it was a 
fun affair. I still have that newspaper with 
all the funny things in it, quite yellowed 
with age, and it™s in German
 and nobody but me can enj
oy it. And th e teachers were 
there, and they laughed with
 us, and it was Œ it was a goodbye and so forth. It was 
really amazing that there was non
e Œ no Œ no animosity whatsoev er. 
Q: And now Œ you st
arted to Œ to tell about wh at
 you did after graduation. 
A: Okay, we had a real Œ real nice vacation. 
On e of my  aunts Œ one of ma Œ sister of 
my father™s had a lovely villa. She actua
lly she lived there all year lo ng, near 
Salzburg
 and we usually spent two or three 
weeks every summer there, and there 
was no ex ception, 1938. On ly it was very sa
d, all the Œ the fun people, the Œ there 
were youngsters our ages, many of them came from 
Czec hoslovakia
, they had their

summer villas at that lake. They were Œ no
ne of them came at the time, because of 
course, the Czechs were next, and I think they knew it, so they just
 Œ they just didn™t 
come. So it was a very Œ it was a lovely  
time, but the good friends weren™t there. 
And then  I took up Œ I watched my  mo th
er cook, and I took
 some dressmaking 
course, and I Œ I choreographed some Œ so
me dances for myself, b ecause I wanted 
to audition, and I was going to , you know, make it big on 
Broadway
. And th at was 
about it. 
Q: Were you aware of a conference in July 1938, the 
Evia n 
Conference? 
A: I just very, very vaguely  Œ ev ery time I 
see it at the museum, 
I say yeah, I think I 
remember that, but I Œ I don™t think I was terribly aware of it, no. It was Œ when Œ 

when  the affidavit came in, I don™t know
 ch ronologically what Œ how it happened, 
but the co ordination of getting your passp
ort; telling the Œ the official, whatever, 
yes, we™re gonna leave; getting the affida
vit; getting sh Œ a reservation on sh ips was 
Œ was Œ was Œ was daunting, it was very difficult. We went on th e 
Holland
 
American, of course they were overflowing 
with requests. And Œ but as I said, you Œ 
you weren™t sure whether Œ wh ether your 
papers were gonna be in order for this 
particular crossing, so Œ 
Q: How did you feel about leave Œ 
talking an  Œ talking about leaving 
Austria
? Did 
you feel very Au strian? And leaving your family?

A: I don™t think it really hit me until just Œ 
just before. As I said before, I had a Œ I 
had a boyfriend and he up and left rather 
precipitously  because of something, I™m 
not su Œ just sure what it was. I guess 
it was the family™s house was searched, 
because one of his brothers 
was a member of the heim Œ 
Heimwehr
. They were not 
Œ they were not Jewish. And he
 just up and left. And he told my  sister, but he tell Œ 
he didn™t tell me. So I was very undone. This
 was in August, I think. And Œ so that Œ 
that was kind of sad. And then  some of my
 Œ my Œ the girlf Œ my girlfriends left. 
One of them left for 
Sweden
, and I still correspond w
ith her, and her grandson 
came to see me about a month ago. So I Œ 
I keep in touch with people, and another 
one I went to school with left for 
England
. And she wanted 
to come to the 
U.S.
, but 
didn™t have her affidavit yet. So people ke
pt leaving, and there was a lot Œ lot going 
on all the time. 
Q: What™s that like for an 18 year old 
girl, and again, did you feel Austrian? 
A: Oh, I felt very Austrian. I did not ever
 want to say that I was German. And of 
course, to this day I Œ I ha Œ I have my  
old passport, and it has a big swastika on it, 
and that really Œ that really hurts. I was 
Œ I was never Œ never wanted  to say that I 

was German, I™m Austrian. And I say it now, 
too. That Œ that was very important. 
Q: Well, here you feel very Austrian and 
Œ and you™re told Œ then
 you Œ your family 
says you™re going to  be leavi
ng. How did that affect you Œ 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

35
A: Well Œ 
Q: Œ at Œ at that time. 

A: Yeah. Well, I think at the time, it was a 
tremendous adventure. I think I felt that 
and I Œ I had to fee Œ it was the idea of
 the young ones go, and somehow make it 
possible for the parents to come too. So  I Œ I think it was that feeling. I Œ I ca Œ I 

can™t really reproduce what I felt at the 
time. I think when you
™re Œ when you™re 18, 
you™re a little selfish. You know, it™s ju
st Œ it™s just one of those things.  
Q: And again, the summer is over, the fall is starting, of thir Œ 

A: The fall is starting, and Œ 

Q: Œ of ™38 and are conditions wo rsening? 
Are you seeing things on the street, are 
you witn essing anything?  

A: I Œ I personally did not w
itness anything. But people are leaving, and then  you 
heard some awful things happen , yes. That 
so and so™s father was shot because he 
tried to get away from something, or yes, 
yes, you did hear things. It was Œ it was Œ 
it got to be awful. But you 
know, until it happens 
to you, it really doesn™t register. 
And of co urse, that gets us to Novemb e
r, and that™s when Œ when things really 
became very serious for us too, for my family. 
Q: From what I understand though, in Octo
ber there were attacks on synagogues, to 
its schools and stores. Were you aw are of
 that before the Novemb er night?

36
A: I Œ I really d Œ I really don™t Œ not awar
e of it, no, uh-huh. Th
ings have a way of 
blending together now, even
 though I rememb er things 
better from back 
then, than I 
can tell you what happened yesterday. But 
still it™s Œ it has a way of Œ of Œ of Œ the-
there are a few dates and things that absolu
tely stand out and alwa
ys will, but then I 
Œ I am not aware of anything in  October. No , it was the Œ the Novemb er seventh 
when  Œ when this young, very 
misguided man by the name of 
Hershel Grynszpan
 
went to the German embassy in 
Paris
 and shot this consular official of some sort, 
vom Ra th
, 
vom Ra th
. And that was on seventh, I th
ink, and then , during the two 
days before the man died Œ he didn™t die un
til the ninth, things started to Œ to boil, 
but didn™t really boil over un
til the man was dead. And then 
Hitler
 took advantage 
of that, and it seemed Œ al
most seemed as th ough he
 was waiting for an occasion 
like this. And th at of course was Œ was ho
rrendousness, the only way I can describe 
it. 

Q: And what was Œ what did you see then? 
A: Well, what I Œ what I saw before it hit 
our family, I remember one thing that Œ I 
don™t know what I was doing down town. Right 
in the center of the city there was a 
Œ I don™t know he Œ whether he was the ra
bbi, or he was Œ he was just somebody 
with Œ threw a robe and a little yarmulke 
on his head, and two or
 three guys went 
just after him with Œ with 
a whip, you know. And the man 
cried, and Œ and leave me

alone, you know, and th e ah Œ an d then peop
le around it, it was Œ it was terrible, you 
know, you just Œ just went away . You Œ 
you Œ you felt you sh ould protect the poor 
man, but then again, if you di
d, then you got the whip. So 
it was this sort of thing all 
the time. S o  that™s what I saw, an d then, as
 I said before, my father took classes. I 
don™t know whether this was pl
umbing, or English, or wh
atever it was he took, and 
he just didn™t come home on Œ on 
Œ we always call it November 10
th
, because that 
was when it Œ when things were really Œ in 
Vienna
 were really unleashed. An d we 
never saw him again. And that was Œ that
 was rough. No  phone call, no anything. 
Somebody called a few days later saying I br
ing regards and he™s
 fine, and hung up. 
Well, it was somebody who was let out appa
rently, for some reason or other. And 
much, much later, not too long ago in fact, 
I read a description of what happened to 
people. They herded them to one 
of the military installations in 
Vienna
 and they 
made them stand up for 24 hours, and th
en  Œ no Œ no water, no food, and then  took 
them to the train statio ns. It was Novemb
er, it was very cold. And the next thing 
they knew, they were in
 Da cha u
. And I™ve Œ I read a lo
t about it because my 
mo ther never Œ never really heard, and I™m glad she didn™t, that 
there was quite a bit 
of torture going on, and horrible things. 
And what puzzles me 
very much, because 
my father had been in the war. He was 
in World War I. He was not a hero or 
anything, but he had served 
in the military. He was only 
52 years old, not quite. He

got to be 52 in January. And people got 
out. If you could prove th at you Œ that you Œ 
that you gonna be out of the country with
in two weeks or some
thing like that. And 
we Œ we moved heav en  and earth. We had 
a nephew of my fath
er™s, a cousin of 
mine, who had been in 
Israel
 by the Œ at that time. He was a rabid Zionist and he 
had gone before things happe
ned. And he Œ I think we 
telegrammed, and Œ and he 
somehow found a way, and we, you know, le
t them know that my father will be out, 
but nothing happened . And the 
Œ we have Œ I can show you that later, we have com-
communications. We have the correspondence 
of my  father. I think after about two 
weeks we had a card saying I™m fine, don™t worry, you know? 
And we got about 
every other week, or something like this. I 
have donated the correspondence to the Œ 
to the Holocaust Museum, I don™t know wh
at they™re gonna do
 with it. I made 
copies though, so I have it right here, I ca
n let you have it. And on it, it says you 
have to have only so  and so  many lines, a
nd be sure and date it, and I don™t know 
what else, I mean you Œ you were really
 Œ you Œ you basically
 had to tell your 
family that you were fine, th
at Œ that was the thing. So that was it, and this was 
January Œ November, December. Ou
r date of departure was 11
th
 of January, wh ich 
was my father™s birthday, and we were so ho
ping that we Œ that he could get out and 
we could see him. And he Œ again and ag ai
n wrote don™t Œ don™t 
change your plans. 
Don™t Œ don™t Œ don™t do it, so we wa 
Œ which we didn™t. And so we left Œ

Q: Le-Le-Let™s back up a little bit. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What else did you see in November? Y
ou said you saw the rabbi being attacked. 
Did you see any other damages? 

A: Yes, horrendous. I Œ I Œ I terribly resent the name of 
Kristallnacht
, because all I 
can think of is Œ is Œ is something pretty
. And it wa Œ there were a lot of Œ lot of 
broken windows that I saw. And I Œ there™ s several other things that Œ one of my  
friends, she was not a real buddy friend, 
but she Œ a good Œ good ac Œ acquaintance, 
called me and said, I want you to co me 
over and see something. She called me and 
then her very best friend. So th e two of 
us went over there and I shall never forg et 
what happened. Some people 
rang the bell and said we Œ I don™t know wh ether they 
said they want to inspect 
the apartment or what it is
, but they totally, totally 
vandalized, like breaking 
Dresden
 figures. Cutting open feather pillows and going 
all over the place, and cutting nice upholste
ry. I mean, it was ju
st something you Œ 
you, in your worst nightmares. So she wa
nted me to see that. And I mean, things 
like that. Or so and so™s father was Œ didn
™t come home, or so and so left, on Œ of 
course, we had a story to tell 
too, but you were told to be
 very careful and Œ and not 
Œ not talk about it, which is
 hard to do. You were rea
lly very dependent on your 
concierge. You don™t call it concierge in 
Vien na
, you call it housemaster in 
Vienna
.

But we had a Œ a family, they
 Œ you know, they 
live sort of on the Œ on th e Œ as you 
come in. And usually have a 
little apartment there. And the 
family that Œ that took 
care of us, I think we Œ we were very lu
cky to not Œ not have
 mo re happen to us 
than it did, because they  put Œ they  had 
Œ th ey could protect you. If somebody came 
to their hou Œ to Œ to  that door an d 
said, okay, tell us, who Œ who should we 
vandalize or something, you kn
ow, you were Œ you were tota
lly in Œ a victim in Œ in 
their hands. And a lot of this Œ this happ
ened . Or if Œ if, let™s say I Œ one of my  
classmates wouldn™t like me, or somethin
g like this, or if Œ if somebody™s Œ 
somebody™s boyfriend you broke up with or 
something. I mean, it 
was this sort of 
thing. Revenge was rampant. It 
was Œ it was not Œ it was not good.  
Q: What did that do to you in a personal way? 
A: Well, I Œ we were terribly, I mean, to Œ 
for my sist er and me to leave, was Œ was 
terrible, you know, what could we do and 
Œ and we Œ we coul
d leave Œ we could 
each take 40 dollars with us. So we had Œ 
Q: Wha Œ wa Œ wh en you sa
y for you to leave was terrible, what did you mean by 
that? 
A: Well, you Œ we didn™t know when we 
were going to  see our parents again, of 
course. By then Mo ther was alone, but my  
uncle and aunt, her sister, had moved in 
with her. And we were terribly afraid that
 something was going to happen to Un cle

Alfred
, because he was president or vice-pr
esident of a company that had its 
headsqu Œ head Œ head quarters in 
Berlin
. And not only Œ of course it was the Œ by 
then he had lost his job, and we were te
rribly afraid that some
thing™s gonna happen 
to him. Well, nothing did, and they lived 
with my mother until they all together 
came over here in 1940, and Moth er could join
 us. But the Œ the id
ea that Œ that our 
father was at 
Dachau
 and Œ and Moth er was alone
 was Œ was pretty awful. 
Q: In Novemb er did you see any destru
ction of synagogues
, or any build ing 
destruction? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, I  saw Œ I sa w a lot 
of this. Interesting thing happened to  my  Œ 
but that di Œ that Œ no, that didn™t happen
 in November, that ha
ppened before, and I 
think I™d like to back up b
ecause that™s rather interestin g story. My Uncle 
George
, 
my  Œ younger brother of my  mo ther™s, who 
I earlier told you about, that he was a 
memb er o f  th e 
Ligity-misten
(ph), the one that was Œ he was hurt in World War I, 
had a store in the inner city of 
Austria
, of
 Vienna
. And one day some Œ two 
SR
 
men came in and said, come with us. And 
he immediately showed  his World War I 
wound, and I don™t know wh at happened  
from there, but they let him go and said, 
but you and your family have
 to be gone in a week. So  here is, you know, your Œ 
your life suddenly, you got to
 Œ wh ere do you go? And at the time the Œ his wife had 
a brother in 
Italy
 Œ I mean, the irony of going from 
Austria
 to
 Italy
. But they did, 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

they were safe with the y
oung boy, who was eight years old at the time, my  cousin
 
Peter
. And they went to 
Italy
, and of course pretty soon
 they were th
rown out of 
Italy
, so they had to go to Œ to 
Cy prus
. And then this Œ then 
they were thrown out 
of there, I™m not sure what 
happened, but they  ended up in 
Palestine
, and were 
protected by the Anglican church. And 
my  cousin, the young boy who was eight 
years old, is a very well-known  university professor, 
Boston
 University. The Œ the 
man in sociology. So, you kn
ow, s-some Œ but I remember we ma Œ my mother and 
my sister and I packed up th
eir stuff after they were go
ne, you know, they had to Œ 
to get out in one week. And we Œ we p
acked  up th eir belongings and Œ and sent 
them to I don™t know where, 
but they Œ th ey never caught 
up with th em, so they Œ 
they had nothing. 
Q: You said that you felt bad about l
eaving your Œ your parents and not knowing 
when  you™re gonna see them. Did you feel bad about leaving the country ? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Feeling Austrian. 
A: I felt very bad Œ badly leaving the co
untry, but as I said before, going to 
America
 was quite an adventure, and there 
were quite a few Œ before things 
happened, before thin
gs got bad, a lot of young pe
ople, not as young as I was, 
maybe a little older, went to 
America
. The ones that Œ with a sense of adventure. 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

America
 was Œ was where Œ wh ere Œ where it was at, you know, we got all the Œ 
the Œ the movies, the
 Fred Astaire
 and 
Ginger Rogers 
movies, and this sort of 
thing. So
 America
 seemed like quite the Œ quite the place to go, cause a lot of 
people did not have th
e good lu ck to go to  Œ to  the u Œ to the 
U.S.
, they had to  go to  
the 
Dominican Republic
. And I know of people who went to 
Co lumbia
 and 
Bolivia
. And that was just not as Œ not as attractive as going to  the 
U.S.
 But it was Œ 
I had very  mixed feelings, I™m sure I did. 
Q: So your quota numb er came
 up while your father as in 
Da cha u
? 
A: Mm-hm, that™s right. I think it came up th
en or maybe a little before that, I™m not 
really sure just Œ just when it come. I ha
ve an old Œ old little 
diary that I have, I 
should look this up, but I™m not
 sure just when we finally
 were told yes, you Œ your 
affadave Œ no, well, not onl
y th e quota numb er, the affidavit was accepted, because 
quite often people got their affidavits a
nd oh ev erything™s gonna be all right. Well, 
something happened , and something was 
not all right, I™m not sure. But the 

comb ination of our affidavits, I think, wa
s Œ was very good with  the Œ the Œ the 
family, the Œ the cousins that
 took us, and the Œ the Œ the 
financial security of these 
two men. 

Q: You said your father was picked up
, was this while he was in class? 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

44
A: Yes. Apparently the whole class was 
picked up. We-We™re not sure. We Œ we 
really don™t know, and we w
ill never know. But they were
 picked up. That was a Œ 
it was probably because I think the Œ th
ese classes were ove
rseen by Œ by a Œ a 
Jewish organization, I™m not sure. Or may 
Œ before emigration or something. We Œ 
we will never know. I mean I will  neve
r know. My mother probably would have 
known, but I don™t know.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
Hedi Pope
. This is tape number two, side
 A
. 
And we™re now in January 1939
, and you started to talk 
about getting ready to come 
to the 
United States
. 
A: We were very sad to leave without kno
wing too mu ch  about our father™s status, 
but our Œ my  aunt and uncle
 who had moved in with Mo th er told us, just don™t 
worry about it, an-and Œ and everythi
ng will be all right, they said. 
Q: Did you write back to your father? 
A: Oh yes, yes, but I think just mother 
wrote, because there were Œ there was Œ you 
know, they limited you to so 
and so many lines, so many Œ a-and only one side of a 
piece of paper and so  forth. So it was just Mo
ther who wrote as Œ as little as she Œ as 
mu ch as you could say in so many word s,
 and he Œ Fath er wrote again Œ again and 
again, the girls should go and I wish them 
a wonderful trip and 
so  forth, but don™t 
make any change of plans on account of me
. So we did Œ we did Œ we did write, 
yes, uh-huh. And we left on the 11
th
 of January , and went to 
Rotterdam
, and there 
we had a friend look out for us for one day 
and a night. Let™s see, yeah, we went to 
Œ we started from 
Rotterdam
 with Œ on th e

Line. It was January in the 
Atla ntic
, it was v ery, very Œ ho
w do you say it? I ge t 
seasick, in other wo rds.  
Q: Wa Œ wh at was it like to say goodbye to  your mo th er? 
A: It was Œ it was very difficult, and I 
rememb er my self j u st so bb ing away . My  
sister was much braver, but I, I was really
 Œ I was really quite undone. But I, you 
know, finally had to  get on the train, and that was it. 
Q: Did you take anything sp ecial with you, 
or did she? Did your
 mo ther give you 
anything special to take? 

A: Well, we had a little Œ we had Œ you could 
take one or two pieces of jewelry, but 
you were told if an 
SR 
man or 
SS
 man on the border says he 
wants that, you have to 
give it to him. So we bought a ring, and 
a diamond pin, and we 
took a few things 
with us, yes, but very little. You know, you 
Œ you had luggage, and there was just so 
much space. 

Q: Did you bring anything
 of sentimental value? 
A: Well yeah, we had diaries and old lette
rs and Œ that I still have. And the Œ the 
little bits of Œ of jewelry and Œ an d pict
ures, photos. Lots of photos and stuff. 
Q: And so what was the train ride like? 
A: Well, the train ride was Œ was very Œ 
very interesting, but not Œ we had a little 
food with  us to Œ to eat on the way, and the lady in  
Rotterdam
 was a friend of one

of the cousins in 
America
 was just lovely, took care of
 us for a day and a night. It 
was very rainy, and gray and 
Œ and sad. That™s all I can de
scribe it in Œ in retrospect. 
Q: And then you get on the boat? 
A: I got on the boat, and that wa
s lots of fun. I hate to admit it. The first four days I 
was terribly seasick, and I was afraid to go
 down  in my  cabin because I always got 
sick. But then I got over that, and the 
Vandam
(ph) was a very slow boat, and there 
was something wrong with it too.
 So instead of just nine da
ys, it took 12 days for us 
to cross. And th ere were a lot of others 
in the same boat, so to speak. Several 
Viennese, and we danced a 
Lambeth Walk 
at Œ in the evening, and the food was 
delicious. And it was really the first time
 on a Œ on a boat for me. We hadn™t 
traveled a great deal. S o  it was sort of a 
Œ almost a last fli
ng kind of a thing. 
Q: Did you run into  any difficulty in 
showing your papers once Œ in  leaving 
Vien na
 
and getting to 
Rotterdam
? You know, wh en you had to
 go th rough that type of 
situation. 
A: Not at all, I had a Œ I had a passport wi
th a swastika on it, and Œ and it was just 
made out, you know, rather recently. And no,
 there was no Œ no problem. I s Œ a lot 
of people did, I think we we
re Œ we were lucky, becaus
e it depended totally on who 
you met up with. As I said, if somebody wa
nted your co at or your Œ your ring or 
something, they Œ you had to
 Œ you had to surrender it. 
There was nobody there that

you said oh hey this Œ th is person is not 
Œ not supposed  to do
 that. This totally, 
totally lawless Œ lawlessness, but
 that was Œ we went thro ugh 
Germ any
, and then of 
course we went thro ugh 
Holland
, 
Rotterdam
, everything was okay. 
Q: How did it feel to go through 
Germany
? 
A: It was a Œ it was a night train, and re
ally it was perfectly Œ perfectly normal. 
Everything Œ everything was just fine. 
Q: You had referred to your passport, even 
previously, with the 
swastika in it. What 
Œ wh at is that like for you to  carry a passpor
t Œ or wh at was it like for you to  carry a 

passport with a swastika? 

A: Well, it Œ if this was the only way I co
uld get out of, that was it. You had to 
accept it. Y ou Œ there was no wa
y you could protest, no wa
y. And I think this is 
very difficult for Œ for 
Œ for young people in 
America
 to Œ to understand, that there 
was no Œ no phone numb er, 
no 9-11 you could quickly ca
ll, or anyth Œ an ybody. 
There was Œ there was no law. There wa
s Œ was absolutely no place where you 
could complain. You just had to accept it. 

Q: Was there any time prior to your leav
ing that you ev er felt your life was in 
immediate danger? 
A: Not really, but I think it was just in my
 nature and my being 18 years old that I 
was just Œ I was optimistic and everything
 was gonna be all right. And the wo rry

about our father, I think was 
just so Œ so on the forefr
ont, that I didn™t worry ab out 
myself. 
Q: Were you a very 
daring young woman? 
A: Gee, I don™t know how to an swer that
. I-I Œ I guess you™d call it enterprising, 
yeah, mm- hm. I don™t know about daring. 

Q: Was your sister as optimistic as you? 

A: No, my sister™s mu ch more
 re Œ much more retiring than
 I am, an-and I think that 
is pretty much true through the rest of our lives. 

Q: So now you™re on 
the boat and for Œ wh at™d you say, 11 days? 
A: Yeah, it was 12 days, mm-hm. Was a Œ 
was a long ride, but th-the landing, the 
approaching 
New York
 harbor is Œ is something th
at Œ that™s Œ that™s just 
overw helming. And it was a Œ finally cleare
d up. The sun was out, it was very cold, 

but there was the 
Statue of Liberty 
against a blue sky, it™s Œ it™s good. And there 
were ma Œ both my  cousins, and only one 
of the gentlemen were at the dock. And 
things went very smoothly from there, we 
had all Œ our papers were in order, and 

we had a big wh at you call steamer tr
unk, an d Œ or two of them, I think. 
Q: How good was your English by that tim
e? You said you had taken English in 
high school. 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope 
 
 
November 6, 1997 
 

 
 
50
A: Well, unfortunately, I had seven years of
 French, but only three years of English, 
and my  English was not good. I could s-so
mewhat understand, but I was Œ it was Œ 
it was a disaster. But of course, here agai
n too, you Œ you Œ wh
en you™re young you 
Œ you can muddle al Œ muddle along. And liv
ing with my  cousins meant at least I 
could Œ they  Œ their Œ th eir English was pr
etty good, they  had very  heavy accents 
still, but the Œ the Œ it was Œ it was pretty g
ood. So right immediately  we didn™t feel 
that this was gonna be a disaster. 
Q: Did you have any special emotions 
wh en you stepped on
to American soil? 
A: Well, I did. I Œ you kn
ow, you Œ you heard so mu ch
 about people kissing the Œ 
the earth, and Œ and Œ and 
Ellis Island
, and so  forth. I think we
 Œ we were a little bit 
more sober about it all. We were glad that 
we were there, but we also were wishing 
that Œ that our parents could be with us. 
Q: On the ship, were there 
other young women your age? 
You said there were other 
people in your s Œ in the similar situati
on, leaving. But were there a substantial 
number of young people in th
eir late teens, early 20s? 
A: Yes, I think I was probably among th
e younger ones, but there were young 
couples, and young singles too. Yeah, it 
was a very Œ it was a very interesting Œ 
interesting 12 days. We 
had Œ we had fun.

Q: So now you™ve landed, you™ve met 
Œ and your Œ did yo
u go directly to 
New 
Jersey
? 
A: We went directly to 
Newark
, 
New Jersey
, yes, and so what are we gonna do 
next? Well, everybody Œ we we
re called refugees. Oh, we 
were one of the big army  
of refugees, and I got to hate that word. 
And we came with all sorts of addresse s. 
Everybody had people to call on that coul
d help. And some Œ some of them were 
very unlikely. But very soon Œ my  Œ my  sist
er very soon found a job with a family 
to take care of some children. And I wa
s determined I was gonna dance. And I 
didn™t Œ didn™t find an ything right away. 
And of course, within a week, we got a 
letter from our s Œ our mo ther that our 
father had died. Which meant of course, 

everything just Œ just kind of fell apart 
there for a few days, and oh, our cousins 
were wonderful. But we had to pick ourselv
es up. As I said before, we he Œ we each 
had 40 dollars. And it™s amazing how far 
40 dollars went in 1939. So we Œ 
Q: What Œ what date did 
you actually land in the 
United States
? 
A: We landed on the 23
rd
 Œ or was it 25
th
? I think it was the 25
th
 of January . I always 
get mixed up between the landing and my  fathe
r™s death. I think his Œ he died on the 
23
rd
 of January, and I th
ink we landed on th e 25
th
, something like that. So it was Œ it 
was very cold in 
Newark
, 
New Jersey
 and we started going in to 
New York
, which 
meant you had a little s Œ little st
reetcar ride that cost 10 
cents. Then you did the 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

52
Hudson
 tubes, which cost a nickel. And th en
 you had the subway
, another nickel. 
So there went, if it™s a round 
trip, 40 cents went for trans
portation. And of course, if 
you were in 
New York
 and you were a whole day, you
 had to have lunch. So  at 
Niddick™s
(ph) you could get a na Œ 
a frankfurt for four or five cents, and an orange 
drink for five cents. And if you were sti
ll hungry you could get 
a cream cheese and 
nut bread for five cents. So for, let™s see, 
40 cents fare and 15 cents, that™s pretty 
good. You still didn™t have to pay more th
an 55 cents for the day. So those 40 
dollars went for Œ for quite some time, 
and everything else, our cousins were 
beautiful about it, and took care of us. My sister, as 
I said, then sh e gave up th e Œ 
the job of taking care of children, and 
she at the time, of course, had Œ knew 
shorthand and typing and sh e was fluent 
in French. Her Eng
lish was better than 
mine. So she found some secretarial work 
very quickly. And I got in touch with 

somebody who had Œ who was th
e pianist for one of my dance teachers. He was in 
New York
 and I looked him up. He was also th
e nephew of somebody we knew, so 
it was almost like a friend. And he says well,
 he said, it just so happens that I got 
together with somebody fro
m one of the cabarets in 
Vienna
 and they™re forming a 
new group, and they  fo und some sponsors
, and maybe they can use a dancer. And I 
got in touch with th is person who was Œ whose name was 
Herbert Berghof
 and he 
was very well known  actor in 
Vienna
, and I did my little twir
ling around with my 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

53
dance dress, and I had a record on the re
cord player. And he says, well, I think 
maybe we can use you. And they had just st
arted rehearsal Œ this was in February Œ 

and we got rehearsal pay, 15 dollars a w
eek. Now that™s Œ that was good. That was 
very good. So I started rehear
sing with this group. It wa
s an interesting group, they 
were something called 
fromme a kleine kunst Bühne
, which literally translated 
means small stage theater. It 
was a Œ sort of a topical review that had been very  
successful i n  
Vienna
. And they  got out quickly, because it was the kind of a topical 
review that made fun of politics, and Œ and 
they Œ they better Œ had to get out. So 
they met again in vien Œ in 
New Yo rk
 with 
Herbert Berghof
 as a director, and they 
had sponsors, a list of spon
sors that you wouldn™t believe. 
George S. Kaufman
 and 
his wife, 
Irving Berlin
, 
Edna Ferber
, down the list. They all Œ I don™t Œ I have no 
idea how much money they 
Œ they gave, but it was a 
little corporation that was 
formed, called itself th e refugee artists™ 
group. And they got a theater and we 
opened a show in  June 1939. And for Œ as
 I said, rehearsal pay was 15 dollars a 
week, and then when
 we opened , we got 40 dolla
rs a week, which was the 
minimu m that actors™ equity paid. And 
you know, all the other refugees made 
anywhere from 12 dollars, 15 dollars, 20 do
llars, but nobody made 40 dollars a 
week. So  I really thought I had it made. 
This was summe r 1939, it was terribly hot. 
There were all but four theaters opened on 
Broadway
 because they were the only 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

54
four that had air conditioning. And the mu si
c box, wh ere I was doing my  thing, was 
one of them. It was just a glorious two 
month. And in terestingly enough, for some 
reason or other, some time before I got 
in with that group 
and knew that it was 
really gonna do something, I 
had applied fo r college scholarships. That was another 
address I had, to be sure and go to  the in
ternational students™ service, and apply for 
a scholarship. Of course, I did really not 
know what a scholarsh
ip was and I really 
didn™t terribly want to go to 
co llege because I had done my  
Matu ra
 and I was not 
that brilliant a student. So I had applied 
anyway, and the woman there didn™t speak 
German. I Œ my English was very broken, so
 we got along just 
fine and Œ and she 
said, well, you might hear from us. And so
metime in August I got a beautiful letter 
from International Student Se
rvice that said, we have
 scholarship for you at 
Miami
 
University in 
Oxfo rd
,
 Ohio
. And I just had totally forgo
tten that I had ever applied. 
And I was so happy performing on 
Broadway
, I really didn™t want to do it. And 
there was some friends Œ friends of my 
cousin™s, wonderful woman who lived  in 
New York
, who was in radio and the arts, sa
ys, you™d be a darn fool if you 
wouldn™t take this. Said, I don™t want to
. She said, well, you 
better. And of co urse, 
war clouds over 
Europe
, very, very obvious things were
 going to  Œ to be really bra 
Œ breaking there very quickly. And this sh
ow had very good critiques, but somehow 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

55
we being refugees and foreigners, with
 the war breaking out, it was all a bad 
situation. We had to  be fingerp rinted
 because we were enemy aliens. So Œ 
Q: Was it Œ was the troupe primarily a Jewish troupe?  
A: No, no. Some Œ some were, some we
re not. And so I reluctantly said to 
Herbert
, 
you know, I™m going to go to co ll Œ 
Herbert 
was the director Œ I was gonna have a 
scholarship. He says oh, I hate to lose yo
u. I said, well, what 
do you think of the 
show? He says well, it may just fo
ld. And it did. And I want off to 
Miami
 
University, 
Oxfo rd
, 
Ohio
. So  that was one of those decisions that I did the right 
thing. At the time it was Œ it was very difficult, and I had to leave 
New Yo rk
 where 
my  sister was, and I was suddenly thro
wn  into  a totally, totally different 
environment. It was a good thing. And I th
ink from then on in, I realized that there™s 
more to it than just staying in 
New York
 and being surrounded by nothing but 
refugees. And it was a Œ it was a good Œ 
it was the best decision I ever made. 
Q: How did the other students ac-accept Œ accept you? 
A: Well, I™m gonna write a book about that 
some time. In fact, at my f Œ my  50
th
 
reunion at 
Miami
 Univ ersity, I was asked to give a speech, and it was mo stly on 
Am-Americanization. And 
Miami
 University was a good place to Œ to get it. I think 
some of them thought I was from the 
mo on, and th ey Œ 
they Œ you know, 
Austria
 
and 
Australia
, and 
Vienna
 and 
Venice
. I mean, it was all very confusing and what 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

56
did you speak, what langua
ge did you speak? And I co
uldn™t believe it. I got Œ I 
went to the Œ the registrar didn™t really kn
ow what to do with 
me, or whoever says 
whether I™m a freshman or a sophomore. He
 said, well, we™ll see. I brought my Œ 
my report cards, but you know, they we
re all in German. So I guess I got 
sophomore status right away. And I said, yes,
 but I just want to dance, I don™t want 
to play basketball. Well, I had to take a
ll these things, cause I was a physical edu Œ 
physical education major. And the faculty 
was just wonderful. I mean, I can™t Œ I 
can™t say enough of the Œ the kindness that 
Œ that was extended to  me. The students 
were kind of strange. I think they re Œ 
really didn™t know Œ I was dating so me, but 

very little, because my Englis
h wasn™t good enough, a
nd I think it was too much 
work  to go out with somebody 
who didn™t speak the language. 
Q: Were there other st
udents in your position? 
A: Yes, there was a Œ a Œ there was an Italian boy, young man from 
Rose
(ph), but 
he was Italian, for some reason or othe
r. And there was a Hungarian and a German 
Œ two German girls, and a whole group of 
Indonesians. And thei
r English was Œ was 
nonexistent, so I don™t know how th ey got 
along. But I had Œ I just Œ the faculty was 
just wonderful, because I™d had to take freshman English, and this woman sat down 

with me, and you know, corrected, and taugh
t me, pronounced and so forth. I Œ I 
immediately got a part in a play becaus
e the word got out 
that I™d been on 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope 
 
 
November 6, 1997 
 

 
 
57
Broadway
, you know, that was Œ so Œ so th is
 Œ this marvelous man, who was a 
well-known 
Sha kespea re
 scholar of all things, gave me a part in the Œ in th e Œ in 
ﬁ
Twelfth Night
,ﬂ and sat down with me and wo rk
ed  on pronunciation. So  there 
were all these wonderful things that happe
ned, and I Œ my  grades were strange in 
the first semester, but my English was Œ 
by Ch ristmas my English was a hundred 
percent better, and I graduated with a 
B.S. 
in 1942. 
Q: What kind of nata Œ and your 
mother, you said, came over when? 
A: Okay, let™s see, this was f-fall 
n i Œ fall 1939, I went to Œ to 
Miami
 and I 
reme mb er there was a minis Œ one of the Œ I think it was a Presbyterian minister, I 
don™t know how I got to him. Well I Œ I had re
ally wanted to join  a church, I needed 
something, especially with Œ 
with my  father having died, 
it was just this Œ it was Œ I 
was totally undone. So I got to Œ to talk
 to somebody from one 
of the churches and 
said that I™d like to help my
 mother come over here. An
d they were actually ready 
to help, but then Mother got
 affidavits from the same two men, and the uncle and 
aunt got Œ there was a distant cousin in 
Illinois
. So they got over 
here, they came 
over here togeth er in April 1940. And ve
ry difficult for them. 
My mo ther was 52. 
Her sister was a good bit older, like 59 or 
something, 60, and Un cle was about in his 
early 60s, and he was a Œ a Œ a big man back in 
Vienna
. And even  though he had a 
little money that he ma
naged to bring out, illegally of 
course, but still out, he had to 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

58
take some insignificant little
 position doing something. A
nd they eked out a living 
for a few years, yeah. Mother came down he
re with me after a few years and Œ and 
spent her last years with Œ with
 me, with her grandchildren. 
Q: Did your Œ you said you ha
d the need to turn to the ch
urch after your father died. 
Did you turn  to the church ra
ther than exploring your Je
wish roots because of what 
happened  to  you because you were Jewish? 
A: I have th e feeling, you kn
ow, it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s funny, I Œ 
I can™t Œ I can™t think of Œ 
of what happened. I have the feeling the churches turned to me. 
I think th ey Œ they 
felt they wanted to do so mething for me. I 
Œ I really think it wa
s that way. I just 
don™t know. It™s a good question, that I 
will ponder, but I don™t 
Œ I don™t know how 
to Œ how to answer that, mm-hm. 

Q: You had to leave 
Austria
 because you were Jewish
. Did Œ did that make you 
feel more, or less Jewish? 

A: Less, I think. I think I was mad. I re
ally think I was Œ was Œ was very angry. 
Q: Angry at being Jewish? 

A: Yeah. If Œ if that™s the way it is, goo
dbye. I was Œ I was not
 brought up with, you 
know, going to temp le and doing this every 
Friday night and the big holid ays, so Œ 
so what good did it do me? It Œ it Œ it Œ it was 
terrible, what it did to me. I Œ I really 

think that was my Œ that was my attitude.  

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

59
Q: You were, I guess in the beginnin
g of your college career when 
Hitler
 invaded 
Poland
? 
A: Yeah Œ yes, yeah. 
Q: What was your response to that news? 
A: Well, I Œ you know, I think we all felt
 well, finally there™s gonna be a war, you 
know? And of course, we were waiting from Œ I think it was a great disappointment 

that 
America
 didn™t do more. In fact, that Œ th
is is something I remember. When we 
were Œ when 
Hitler 
marched int Œ in March ™38, what did President 
Roosevelt
 say? 
Wha Œ wh y doesn™t he? Because we had grea
t respect for the Œ for the president. 
Help is gonna come from th
ere, you know, that was the promised land. And that 
was a great disappointment. Now, I was old 
enough to understand that, at the time. 
And then you came over here, and there 
were some stran g e things. There was a 

Father 
Coughlin
(ph), th is isolationists. And by 
th en we were old enough to 
understand. And I rememb er at 
Miami
 University there was 
a lot of this Œ this 
isolationists, like they didn™t know wh at 
language I spoke, and so  forth. You know, 
it was f-fro m Œ from another world. I think 
this was an eye opener. And I don™t 
know what my reaction to war was. I thi
nk if Œ I think we were terribly scared. I 
was at the time scared that
 my  mo ther wasn™t going to  make it out. And I think it 
was the last Dutch boat 
that came Œ that left 
Rotterdam
 in April. And I also 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope 
 
 
November 6, 1997 
 

 
 
60
reme mb er that one of my  best friends Œ 
but this already happened  in  summer ™39, 
she came over, I knew she was on the 
Bremen
, and th at was one of the ships that Œ 
I think it was the 
Bremen
 Œ th e news was turned  around, it was going back . And I 
said, oh my word, 
Charlotte
 is on it. Well, th ey turned back again and sh e Œ she 
landed. But it was Œ it was those Œ those 
things. So I think it was f-finally it was 
gonna do something. And Œ and also maybe
, just maybe Americans were gonna be 
pulled in. But of course they weren™t until 
they had to. Which is a Œ which is all Œ 
which I can understand. I can unders
tand it now better than I did th en. 

Q: So you were in college 
for the next three years? 
A: Well, I Œ I Œ I graduated in Œ in 19
42, and during the summers during those 
years, I had camp jobs. I was a camp  Œ camp  counselor, because my  Œ my  field was, 

well, as I said, physical education, but I 
still did the dance as a kind of a major. And 
at one of the Œ one of the summer camps, 
the head counselor wa
s a faculty member 
at 
Wellesley
. And she asked me what I was gonna do when I graduated from 
Miami
, and I said well, I guess I™ll teach phy
s ed in some school. She says oh, go 
on, go on with it. I™ll w h at I can do 
for you to get you a scholarship  to 
Wellesley
, 
and by golly, she did. And I Œ from 
Miami 
University, I went to 
Wellesley
 on a full 
scholarship and got a Master™s
 degree there in ™43. So  I had it made by then , cause 
that Œ that opened all the doors.

Q: So, just to get b
ack to the church; so 
you said the church was a big help to  you a-
and but did you con 
Œ actually convert? 
A: Well n Œ yeah, I actually converted, but Œ 
but again I didn™t Œ didn™t practice and 
Œ 
Q: Wha Œ when  did you co nvert? 

A: I™m trying to  think. I think ™39, I thi
nk it™s before I went to college. No, no, no, 
™40. I think it was ™40 because 
Miami
 kind of Œ you know, th
ey were nice to me. 
They Œ they Œ they cared. 
So I Œ it mu st have been
 1940, somewhere there. 
Q: What Œ what denomination? 

A: It was Œ it was Presbyterian because th
e Presbyterian minister, you know, was Œ 
was just very kind, very nice, and his wife
 invited me to Thanksgiving dinner, that 
sort of thing, you know, it Œ it Œ it Œ I gue
ss you™d call it an opportunist. But th en, 
whoever is nice to you, you 
know, you Œ at the time I wa
s Œ I was alone, I had to Œ 
to Œ to fend for myself. So I think that™s 
Œ that™s what happened, I™m not so su re. 
Q: So you were at 
Wellesley 
for a year? 
A: For a year, yes. That was a very tough 
year. It was 40 Œ ™42. Fall ™42 to  ™43, was 

very cold . They  Œ because of the fuel s
hortage, they made a two month vacation. I 
think we Œ we left there early in Decemb
er, and didn™t come back til February. I 

took a job so mewhere in
 a public library in 
New Yo rk
. My mother was here by 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

62
then, of course. And in ™43, I graduated 
and Œ ™43 Œ of course
, the war was very 
much on, and accepted a job. I had Œ yeah
, I had th Œ some choices, but Œ and I 
really wanted to Œ to Œ my mother, of cour
se, very desperately wanted me to stay in 
New York
, but noth ing came through in 
New York
. So I went to 
Spa rtanburg
, 
South Caro lina
, 
Converse
 College, and had three very
 happy years there as an 
assist ant professor. And th
at took me to 1946.  
Q: You obviously fo llowed the path of 
the war. How difficult 
was that for you? 
A: Well, again, I was very young, and you 
had these attachments to various people 
who were on different fronts. I co
rresponded with one young man in 
Europe

dating in  
Spa r ta nburg
, it was a Œ 
Q: The-These were all Americans? 

A: Yeah, oh yeah, uh
-huh. This was a Œ 
Spartanburg 
was very much a camp town, 
Camp 
Croft
. It was an infantry camp. And it wa
s a lovely college that had a very  
interesting mu sic department. So with Œ w
ith my dance thing I Œ I really had a Œ it 

was a good Œ good place for me. Coopera
tion with th e mu sic department, and I had 
to put on the Œ the annual May Day and th
ere were several other chances to dance 
my self, and it was Œ it was a good
 Œ it was a good three years. 
Q: Can you describe your th oughts at
 the time of the end of the war?

A: May 1945, I rememb er it 
so well and Œ and I get a bi
g, you know, young kids 
shake their heads because it Œ it was at 
Converse
 College, and I guess we heard the 
news on the radio and everybo Œ everybody
 sa Œ it was a n nounced that no classes 
this morning because th ere™s gonna be bi
g announcements about armistice. And we 
were all assembled in the Œ in the big a
ssemb ly hall and listened to a radio saying 
the war is over. So that was Œ that was tr
emendous. And of course I Œ my  mo ther 
was in 
New York
 and my  sister was working. And I was, by then , 20 Œ 25, and I 
was just wondering what Œ what was gon
na Œ what Œ what™s
 gonna happen in 
Austria
. I didn™t immediately want to come 
back, because I realized that that™s 
impossible, and I didn™t have
 any Œ didn™t have
 Œ had very little mo ney. My first 
salary was 1700 dollars a year
 for assistant professor. It™s
 hard to believe, isn™t it? 
Q: Were you a citizen? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: When did you become a citizen? 
A: You take out first papers when you firs
t come. And I took out my first papers in
 
New York
. This was Œ it mu st have been right away in ™39. And it takes five years, 
so that would have been  ™44. So meth
ing happened there, because I was in 
Ohio
 
when  I was supposed to  be doing something 
else, be sworn in  for something, and it 
took extra long for me. It Œ it took, I thi
nk five years and a half for me to be a

citizen, but Œ because there was some paperw
ork there. So it must have been ™44, 
maybe Œ maybe early ™45, I™m not sure ju
st Œ just when, but yes, I definitely 
couldn™t wait. Your Œ your first papers ar
e your Œ your sort of 
your Œ your passport 
to everything. But we had Œ 
we had to be fingerprinted.
 When  the war broke out in 
September 1939, all alien Œ I was an enem
y alien. I had that passport with the 
swastika on it. So I was an enemy alien, 
and had fingerprinted. But Œ and you had a 
little card with your fingerprints on it, I thin
k, or something. It was Œ was kind of 
obnoxious, but then , why not?
 It™s just like now, you 
know, with a Œ I Œ I Œ the 
immigration nowadays, you know, I Œ I tr
ied to tell everybody I was a legal 
immigrant. And that was the only way to co
me to this country , I don™t think there 

were illegal immigrants then, I don™t know , maybe there were. But this Œ this was 
all very legal. 

Q: Did you have any negative experiences
 from other Americans because of where 
you came from and the way you spoke? 
A: I reme mber one Œ one professor in the education department in
 Miami
 
Univ ersity who gave me a 
D
 and I was very undone about it. It was very difficult 
for me, I mean the expressions were 
so Œ it was so far removed from my 
background. And I remember I went to my  advisor at the time and I said, I don™t 
know wh at I™m gonna do, you know, it was 
so divis Œ and she talked to him, and

she very frankly said well Œ he said Œ he 
said, how is she every gonna get along in a 
school with that Œ with a broken English,
 or something like th
is. That was Œ that 
was the only time though. Othe
rwise no, it was Œ it was nothing but Œ but positive. I 
Œ I must say I Œ 
Q: Where did you live after the war? 

A: Okay , I was three years in 
Converse
 College, and I got Œ I was married in ™46. 
And that™s very interesti
ng story because I corresponde
d with my husband for a 
year before I met him. His Œ he was in 
South Pacific
, and my  best friend, who went 

to 
Indiana 
University while I was at 
Miami
, met her husband at 
Indiana
 
University, and they were married there.
 And when  the war broke out, her husband 
went into  the navy and was stationed in th e 
South Pacific
. She took a job with the 
Defense Department in 
Washington
. And every time I went from 
Spartanburg
 to 
New York
, I stopped over in
 Wa sh in g ton
 and visited with her 
and we had fun, we 
took pictures. And she sent a photograph 
of her and me, to her husband in  the 
So uth 
Pacific
. And this Lieutenant 
Pope
 saw my  picture and wanted to know whether I 
was free and available. So I said, well we
™ll Œ we™ll try a correspondence. An d he 
wrote me a letter and I wrote back , and we 
went back and forth for a year. And it™s 
Œ was ver Œ it was a very interesting corre
spondence. And Œ and war was over in the 
South Pacific 
in August 95 Œ in Œ in Au gust ™45.
 And he came back Œ well, the Œ

the single guys didn™t come back right aw
ay , you know, they had to  wait. So he 
came to 
Spartanburg
 in January  ™46, and stayed a
nd stayed. And I said, don™t you 
think you sh ould see your mo th er and fath
er? He said yeah, I think I™ll do that, and 
hope to get a car away from 
my father, and I™ll come back
. And he did exactly that, 
and he was back within a week and stayed
, and we became engaged and married in 
June ™46. And th e funny thing is that he kept
 all my letters, and I kept all his letters. 
And when we celebrated our 50
th
 anniversary a year ago, I put all this together into 
two books and gave it to my  children. So 
th ey have all that correspondence, which 
is kind of a nice story. 
Q: How many ch ildren do you have? 
A: Two. We have two children; a daughter
 Bonnie
, who is Œ lives in 
Des Mo ines
, 
Iowa
, married for the second time. She is a 
special education, learning disabilities 
teacher. She is married  to a Œ to a Œ to 
a physician. Her first husband was Œ is an 
academic, he was Œ he™s now vice 
president of a university in 
California
. And sh e 
had a child with the first husband, 
our only granddaughter. She™s 19 som Œ

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
volunteer collection interview with 
Hedi Pope
. This is tape number two, side 
B
, 
and you were talking about your son. 
A: Okay, our son 
Bruce
 is Œ he™s a little younger than daughter 
Bonnie
. Lives in 
Atlanta
, is an optometrist. He was marrie
d for five years, but is divorced. 
Q: Did you work after you were married? 
A: When we got married in 
1946, we first settled in 
Wash ington
. You could not 
find an ap artment for love or mo ney in 
Wa shington
 in 1946. Somehow we Œ we Œ 
we got a little place in 
Adams Morgan
, and I immediately found a teaching 
position which Œ which was called 
Marjorie Webster
 Junior Co llege. I taught 
dance for two years, until our daughter
 was born in ™47. We moved into 
Fairlington
 
Apartments, stayed there for four 
years until we built this house, 1400 
Questo
(ph) 
Drive. I did what I said I was gonna do wh
en  I was 10 years old, I was gonna have a 
dance school, and I did it in 
Alexandria
, 
Virginia
. I opened it in 1947, and it was a 
Œ was a really flourishing business. I™m very
 proud to say that I had as many as 250 

students. I taught afternoons, of course, ch
ildren had to  come after school. I did all 
sorts of benefits and Œ and performan
ces. I carried on until 
about 1980. I was 
somewhat burned out by th en, and one of 
my  former students took over briefly, 
only she didn™t try to Œ she Œ she didn™t wa
nt to work that hard. And it™s finally

closed, I™m not sure just when, 1985, I th
ink. We had a Œ a Œ 
a professional group, 
dance group attached to it, but that Œ that
 real ly depended on funding and things 
became just too difficult. So I™ve been 
very happily retired
 since about 1980. 
Q: Do you think that you wo
uld be a different adult if 
you hadn™t experienced what 
you had gone through? 

A: Oh yes. And I hate to Œ ha
te to say this but I think my
 two children are Œ are very 
di Œ they ™re wonderful children, and they
™re making a good liv
ing, and they™re Œ 
they™re wo rking hard , but they ™ve never had 
the hardsh ips that I had to go through, 
and it™s Œ it™s hard to admit it but I think 
a little hardship now and then is good for 

you. 
Q: What did it do fo r you? 
A: Well, I™m Œ I™m more compassionate. 
I™m more aw are of what Œ what awful 
things can happen, and I don™t know, it™s ju st Œ I™m not Œ I™m not glad that things 

happened  th e way th ey  happened, but I Œ 
it has certainly Œ certainly widened my  
horizon, if that™s a Œ that™s an understatemen
t, I think. Yeah, I think things could be 
very different, very different
. I can see it now. We go to 
Austria
 often. I have good 
friends there, I went back to my 50
th
 high school reunion, and I stayed with a former 
classmate who was m Œ first time
 married to a pilot in the 
Luftwaffe
. And sh e 
invited me. And I think it was almost Œ th-t
he invitation wi Œ to me was almo st like

a peace offering, it was wonderful. She Œ she 
just was as sweet and nice as you can 
be. And I heard a lot of stories that what 
happened to people wh
o stayed over there. 
And some of the experiences were worse than mine. 
Q: Yo-Y ou™re saying austri Œ not Œ 
not Jews, but Austrians who stayed? 
A: Yeah, Austrians, mm-hm. 
Q: Yeah. Was there ever a 
time when you resisted thi
nking about what you went 
through in those difficu lt months in 
Austria
, and then  losing your father? 
A: Well, I Œ I don™t know how to
 answer that. Of course, I th
 Œ I think of Œ in fact, I 
think of it all the time and it™s Œ it™s very di
fficult to Œ to Œ to no
t Œ not be bitter. Ma 
Œ my mother lived with us 
for 10 years and she naturall
y, understandably was very 
bitter. And she could Œ she coul
d not enjoy the things she 
should have enjoyed, like 
a Œ two cute little grandchildren here. And 
my husband was very
 good to her. My 
husband is Gentile. So she was bitter. I Œ 
I am not bitter, and Œ 
and I don™t think I 
ever will be. I think the Œ the Œ the mu
seum d-doing the Œ the museum work is 
almost like therapy. 

Q: Let™s talk about that now. Can you 
describe your first encounter with the 

mu seum? This is before you began as 
a volunteer. How did 
you learn about the 
mu seum and so forth? 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

A: Well, there was an awful lot in th
e paper ab out the Holocaust Museum. And 
initially, maybe when it was fi
rst chartered, which I thi
nk was in 70 Œ 1978 under
 
Jimm y Carter
, I said to myself, wh
at do we need a museum right here in 
Washin gton
 for? I Œ really, this was my reacti
on. Wh ich is strange, but Œ but that 
was it. I said, people are not gonna unders tand it. Which, yo
u know, I had exp Œ 
experience with that, and th at™s why I never 
really Œ I never really talked about my 
experiences to anybody. My 
children didn™t know about Œ about their grandfather 
until they were grown, because I had the fee
ling that was Œ was Œ I couldn™t do it, I 
don™t know. It™s strange, but it™s Œ that™s 
the way it was. So I had the feeling wha-
what™s this Œ what™s this 
museum gonna do here? And th
en i-it was built. Of course, 
you saw the picture of the Œ the railroad ca
r coming into the muse
um, and all that, it 
got be kind of exciting. So when it Œ wh
en it opened, and there was a little item in 
the paper ab out volunteers are Œ are being 
searched for, I Œ I a
pplied. And I think 
the first visit was Œ is quite overwhelming.
 And I Œ I remember my sister and some 
other people said, how can yo
u do that, how can you do th
at? And I still have a very 
good friend who was Œ was married to a Ge
rman, and she said, I don™t want to go 
there, I can™t go there. Different people react differently. I Œ I Œ I wouldn™t say I 
enjoyed it, but it was Œ to me it 
was wonderful that this was done. 
Q: So you began wo rki
ng when  it first opened? 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope 
 
 
November 6, 1997 
 

 
 
71
A: I Œ I Œ I think I was in the second group
 of volunteers. It opened in Ap ril ™93. I 
didn™t start working until October/November ™93. So Œ 
Q: And Œ and what kind of
 work do you do there?  
A: Just on the floor. I can™t thin
k of the word right now for Œ 
Q: In the Visitors™ Service? 

A: Thank you, Visitors™ Services, yes,
 uh-huh. The Œ th e usual, you know, 
answering questions in the information desk
, giving the little spiel at the elevator, 
tearing tickets and just Œ just generally. I 
Œ I wish sometimes that
 the work would be 
more intelligent, but then, if
 they need the menial task
s, that™s all right too. 
Q: Why is that all right? 

A: Well, they need Œ so
mebody needs to do it. 
Q: How has working at the mu
seum affected your life, or has it? And has it affected 
your memories of the Holocaust? 
A: Yes, it has definitely affected my me
mories of the Holocau
st. I have a library 
about the Holocaust. I™ve learned 
a lot of things about it that
 I didn™t know. This is Œ 
this is Œ and the bookstore, I think, in that
 museum, is w o nderful. I Œ I Œ I buy all the 
time, and I Œ I feel as though this is a Œ th
is is very important work . Very important. 
I had a chan ce to Œ to do so me of the 
Fanny Mae
 tours, but I truly felt that the 
children who are led in small 
groups had no idea what this
 was all about; they were 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope 
 
 
November 6, 1997 
 

 
 
72
not prepared. I think it™s b
een corrected now, and they
 only take the little older 
ones, and prepare them better. I Œ I love 
to give a little briefi
ng to th-the group 
there. But I la Œ I like my duty at the group
 desk best, because there yo Œ I have the 
feeling I™m Œ I™m dealing w
ith Œ with people, and I Œ I love these little older 
teenagers, juniors or seniors in high sc
hool. And give them the briefing and tell 
them about no eat or drink an
d that sort of thing. And th en I very briefly mention 
that when you go on the fourth fl
oor now an d you see the takeover fo r 
Austria
, you 
think of somebody who™s been there,
 and their mouth just drop open. 
Q: Cause you tell them you yourself are from 
Austria
? 
A: That™s a huh, just like that, you know. 
And I wish I could do more of that. That™s 
the Œ that Œ that™s 
[indecipherable]
. I wouldn™t call it a complaint, because that™s 
the way it is, but one Œ I think one could 
Œ could use people lik
e me, who™ve been 
there, and Œ 
Q: What special insights do you think yo
u bring because of your experience? 
A: That it™s really, truly true and somebody 
who was there is still alive. It™s a Œ I Œ I 
th Œ that™s what makes it very interesti
ng to me, that I™m old enough now to lo ok 

back at it and how Œ how Œ 
how wonderful that I could 
be there and now I™m here 
and I can still talk about it, and it™s all true
. I Œ I think the muse
um has la Œ done a 
lot to the Œ the deniers of 
the Holocaust anyway, but then
 if there™s somebody there 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope 
 
 
November 6, 1997 
 

 
 
73
who Œ who really Œ and this 
person, you know, I speak En
glish pretty good, and all 
that kind of stuff. It™s Œ I think it makes 
it very believable to Œ to that particular 
group, and I can tell, b ecause then they ge
t on the elevator and 
Œ and they say thank 
you, thank you so mu ch  and that sort of th
ing. It™s Œ it Œ I think it means something. 
Q: If you have friends who are survivors, 
do you enlist them to be volunteers in the 
mu seu m? 
A: I haven™t really, no I haven™t Œ I haven™t 
tried. I Œ I don™t have any friends here 
who are survivors. I™ve Œ me think, no, I Œ 
I don™t have an ybody. My  sister came to 
visit and of course she looked at it, a
nd she was Œ she was somewhat blown away 

by it. I think you are when you see it the fi
rst time, but then you get used to it. 
Q: Can you describe your relationships w ith th e other volunteers who are survivors, 

or who were witnesse
s to the Holocaust? 

A: In my particular group, let me see, let 
me  think. Yeah, my  particular group is one 
Œ one other lady from 
Hungary
, and we talk about it a little
 bit, but not very much. 
And then  there™s another gentlema n on Fr
id ays who Œ Frid ay mo rn ings who I talk 
to. I™m not sure what happened to him. We Œ we talk about it very little. It™s 

interesting, but we Œ we don™
t. I Œ I don™t feel our Œ I™m Œ I want to dwell on it. I™m 
very happy to talk to you a
nd talk about it there, but Œ bu
t to constantly Œ it™s a little 
bit like, you know, people, men who have b
een in a war, and constantly talk about 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope 
 
 
November 6, 1997 
 

 
 
74
their experiences in the war, and people just 
sort of yawn and say,
 yeah, yeah. It™s Œ 
it™s li Œ it™s a little bit li
ke that, and I don™t want to be that way. 
Q: Can you tell me about your impressions
 of the me Œ museum™s non-survivors 
volunteers and staff, either Jewish or non-Jewish? 
A: I™m Œ I™m very impressed with the 
type of person who is a volunteer. I don™t 
know whether I™m just Œ just
 lucky with th e particular group on Frid ay afternoons, 

but they  are just a Œ just a wonderful grou
p of people, and they Œ th ey Œ they listen 
to your ex periences and they Œ they  Œ they  
feel that I have something to offer that 
they don™t have, and th ey like to listen a
nd hear about it. I have to say the same  
about all the nice young people who are employed, and not volunteers. I say that 

especially because I-I™ve hear
d people complain about them
 being not always aware 
and tactful and so fo rth. I™ve had just th
e opposite experience. I Œ I think they™re 
very nice young people, and they  too want to
 listen, and when  they  hear that you™re 
a survivor, oh, you know, they
 Œ th ey get very  curious. And one young man wrote a 
paper about me for his Œ one of his college courses. 

Q: This was an intern, 
you mean, at the museum? 
A: No, he was a regular employee. He wa 
Œ he was a regular Visitor Services, but 
paid, Paid staff.

Q: What is it like for you when  you™re at th
e mu seum and you hear people speaking 
German, do you say anything? 
A: Yes indeed, I say it in German. And then
 th ey kind of look
 around and they™re 
very happy. I do that in German and I speak
 en ough French too, to  do it, and I enjoy 
that very much. I Œ I Œ it™s Œ it™s difficult to 
admit, but my mother tongue is sort of 
gone away. It™s difficu lt sometimes to Œ to
 express myself. So it™s Œ yeah, I Œ I like 
that the Œ the Œ the foreign language thing is
 Œ there should be mo re of it, I think and 
should be publicized 
perhaps that Œ but then again, me Œ especially Germans, they 
all speak English, so they
 don™t really need me. 
Q: Is there any memorable experience that
 you™ve had while you™re working at the 
mu seu m? 
A: Well, the Œ the one small group of 
Fanny Mae
 kids I had, and I led them around 
and we came to the Œ to the Au
strian part and then to the 
Evian
 Conference, and the 
idea of Œ of people not Œ pe
ople not being ab le to go anyw
here if they™re thrown out 
of their own country , and this young man, w
ho had no clue to wh
at this whole thing 
was all about, he says, oh dear, where woul
d I go? That to me was a very poignant 
remark. Otherwise I Œ I Œ these very much 
routine, and it™s Œ it™s pleasant work, but 
it™s not Œ not terribly challenging, shall we say. 
Q: Are there any particular exhibits 
there that you iden
tify with personally? 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope 
 
 
November 6, 1997 
 

 
 
76
A: Yes. I Œ I think the Œ the one Œ the little Œ little video on 
Austria
, which is Œ is 
very wrong in a way, because it doesn™t 
show the many people that didn™t go out 
there and yell 
heil Hitler
; there were a lot of them. I 
me an, on the ou tside it looked 
as though they were welcoming 
Hitler
, but there were a lot of them who didn™t. The 
Œ let™s see, seems to me there was a Œ 
a Œ one Œ one thing that gives me goose 
pimples every time I g o  up ther
e, there is something called a 
Horst Wessel Li ed
, 
have you ev er heard of that? Which became
 almost like an anth
em, and we had to 
learn the words to it. And that Œ that is 
being played , you know, on the fourth floor. 
And every time I go up there a
nd hear it, I just Œ just 
shiver a little bit. It™s 
interesting. It™s a very kinesthetic
 experience. And the whole thing on 
Kristallnacht
 is Œ is to me is Œ is very Œ very
 shattering. It™s shattering to me, and 
sometimes I stand up there and people go up 
there and they look 
and then they walk 
right by. And I feel as though I want to 
shake them and say hey, read on, you know, 
that sort of thing. So I think that™s Œ 
that™s probably  Œ but that™s impossible to 
impart on anybody else. That™s just someth
ing you Œ you have to have experien ced 
yourself and Œ and nobody else can Œ can fe
el the way you do with things like that. 
Q: Did you lose any ex tended memb ers 
of your family? Do 
you know of any who 
lost their lives? 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope 
 
 
November 6, 1997 
 

 
 
77
A: Yes, uh-huh. We Œ let™s see, I have 
cousins on my father™s family that were 
deported to 
Auschwitz
 and 
Theresienstadt
, and I wasn ™t sure which ones, so I 
looked up their names and I 
found them in the archives. 
Those were children of the 
older sister of my Œ my father, so they we
re quite a bit older than I was. And I have 
a cousin in 
England
 who lo st her parents and older 
sister. She is exactly my age. 
Her father was my Œ my father™s brothe
r, and mother. So we lost them. Let me 
think, on my mother™s side, there was a 
cousin of my mother™s, and her mother™s 
sister. So the very, very  old lady, and 
her daughter, they were deported to 
Theresienstadt
 and the old lady was 80 years old,
 had a broken hip wh en she was 
deported. So I hate to think of
 what Œ what happened to  her. 
Q: What is it like to stay in in th e archiv
es and look at a list and see your family 
relations™ name? 

A: Well, I don™t know, it™s just Œ I don™t 
know wh ether it was because it was almo st 

60 years ago or wh at. And I have the feeling 
if Œ if Œ what they must have suffered, 
I should suffer a little b it, looking at the na
mes. That™s one way to look at it. I don™t 
know how Œ how else to Œ to
 describe it, you know, it™s Œ 
it™s Œ again, it™s sort of 

like therapy. It™s guilt, I guess. I don™t know. 
Q: Guilt of what?

A: Guilt that I™m here and they are not. 
Cause it was Œ it was luck, and these two 
cousins, one of them Œ one of them died 
when  she was 80. The other one, kind of an 
interesting story, the one that Œ that was 
married and divorced an
d has a son, is now 
94 years old and lives in 
Helsinki
. Cause her son, who got his degrees from 
Swarthmore
 and 
Harvard
, he™s a psychiatrist, marri
ed a Finnish girl, and the 
Finnish girl couldn™t stand it in the 
U.S.
, so they had to  move to 
Helsinki
. And he 
teaches there, and my cousin 
Annie
 lives in 
Helsinki
, and writes, and sh e writes in 
German and English and Finn
ish and French. A real geni
us. And my sister visited 
her last Œ last 
[indecipherable]
 so some Œ some people, yo
u know, if Œ if these two 
women wouldn™t have given 
us the affidavit and the impetus to come, we Œ I Œ I 
wouldn™t be here. So it™s Œ 
Q: Over the years, in 50 - 60 years later, 
have your feelings ab
out being born Jewish 
changed? 

A: I don™t think about it. And was kind
 of interesting, 
I have one Œ one 
granddaughter, and okay, my  children are Œ ar
e half Jewish, so my granddaughter is 
Œ has one Jewish grandmother, me. And th is
 was a few years ago, she Œ they  going 
to
 Co ng rational
(ph) church , or something like th
at. And she says, you know, Mom, 
you know I am Jewish? An
d you should see her, she™s blonde and Œ the mo st 

beautiful blonde hair, blue eyed . She l
ooks like a Œ like a Scandinavian of so me

sort, but you know, it™s that sort of thing,
 it™s Œ it™s Œ ma kes you 
laugh. No, I don™t Œ 
I don™t Œ I don™t feel Jewish. And I don™
t Œ this dwelling on Œ 
on what happened, 
and some awful things happened  to thes
e people who Œ who speak for the mu seum, 
you know. I don™t know wh ethe
r you™ve Œ you™ve interv iewed an y of the ladies who 
Œ who sp eak about their experiences, and Œand Œ and th ey go around talking about 
it all the time. I don™t think I want to do th at. 

Q: Did your mo ther or 
sister also convert? 
A: No, no, mm-hm. But my  mo ther never we
nt to Œ never went to synagogue. You 
know, we live across one s Œ synagogue right
 here. I™ll show it to you. And Mother 
was lonesome and Mother didn™t have a
nybody her age, and I said, well, Mother, 
I™ll take you across there, I know they ha
ve wo men™s gr Œ oh, I don™t like that. 
Q: So neither your mo ther or your si
ster were upset when they heard Œ 
A: No, no, oh no, no. 
No, they  Œ I think th ey encourag
ed it. Not at all. It seems 
strange, but Œ but I think Œ I think European 
Jews are very different in that respect 
from American Jews. Maybe it be
came that way, I don™t kn
ow. I Œ I just truly don™t 
know, I would hate to Œ to express my
 Œ an opinion. My  Œ my  cousin, the 
sociologist college professor, he Œ th
ey converted when
 they were in 
Palestine
 with 
the Anglicans. I think they 
became Anglican. And he, in fa
ct, writes a lot and talks a 
lot about religion. Was on television with 
Bill Moyers
 not too lo ng ago, and he

considers himself a Œ maybe not a Christian, 
but Œ but forgets about it. So this is a Œ 
I think th e har Œ the Œ what has happened 
has a lot to do with it. He maybe felt 
angry too. Hey, if you don™t want me, I 
don™t want you kind of a feeling. I don™t 
know. That™s hard to analyze. 
Q: You said that you really did not tell 
your children when they were growing up, 
about your Œ 

A: That™s right. 
Q: Œ experience, or what happened to th
eir grandfather. And 
wh en did you start 
telling them? 
A: I hate to pinpoint it, I Œ because I™m not
 sure Œ when I had the feeling they were 
old enough to understand. When
 they learned things in hi
story, you know, to s Œ to 
place it where Œ where it belonged.  

Q: And what was their reaction? 

A: I Œ I Œ I know Œ I know my Œ my daughte
r, let™s see Œ I took her to Œ we were in 
Vienna
 together, and I took her to my fathe
r™s grave, and there was some Hebrew 
letters on it, and I think that™s Œ that™s 
when it came out. She 
was a teenager then. 
Q: So your father™s 
body was returned from 
Dach au
? 
A: He was cremated, yeah. Because the stor
y goes that it™s Œ it™s Œ that he died from 

natural causes, if you can say that. It™s 
ridiculous. He Œ he became ill with 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

81
pneumonia. And believe it or not, he Œ ther
e was a hospital. He was Œ it was at a Œ 
the Œ at the concen tra Œ conc-concentration 
camp  hospital, and died  there. So his Œ 
his ashes and Œ and belongin
gs with a little p ackage, you
 know, came Œ came to 
Moth er. And something happened there, he 
Œ they Œ th ey wouldn
™t open the grave 
of his parents, so he™s actually buried
 with his grandmother. Very, very strange. 
And I go there, I m
ean, when we go to 
Vien na
 I always go to  Œ go to  the grav e. 
Q: What was your daughter™s reaction wh en
 you to ld her then that Œ of your 
background? 
A: I don™t think she Œ I don™t think she reac
ted at all. She says, yeah, I saw Œ I saw 

the Hebrew. Is Œ this was not Œ this was not
 anything that was either upsetting her or 
even Œ it was just something sh e Œ she to
ok. And then  I think she Œ she told her 
brother and Œ and he said, oh,
 you™re kidding. But that wo
uld be his reaction, he™s a 
different sort. So it™s Œ it™s not Œ it™s not 
that mu ch of a deal, somehow. I hate to 
admit it, but that™s ju
st about the way it is. 
Q: Are there any sights or sounds today 
that trigger a memo ry of your time Œ 

A: The 
Horst Wesse l Œ
 the 
Horst Wessel Lied
, yes, and oh,
 Strauss 
waltzes, yes, 
mm-hm. But I think that™s my  dancing back
ground that does that. I was Œ I would 
just come from Œ from Œ we Œ we spent two weeks in
 Europe
 in September, and we 
were Œ for one week we were in 
Austria
 in a little village
 way up in the
 Alps
. And 

 
Interview with Hedi Pope

it™s kind of interesting to s ee these young people, it™s Œ
 Austria
 is Œ is booming, you 
know, it™s very, very  do Œ economy  is doing ve
ry well, and even the people up there 
that Œ wh at used to be peas
ants, they™re very Œ they sp
eak English rather well, and 
you Œ you wonder what their gr
andparents did. In fact, that was my real reaction. I Œ 
there was a group of German kids at
 the mu seum, and it was such a happy 
coincidence because the Œ the museum should somehow be prepared  to get foreign 
s-speaking people into the 
right places. Well, this was 
wonderful, this was a group 
of exchange students who were on their wa
y back home, I think, they came Œ they 

were in 
Cleveland
. And they were wonderful kids, 
very  well behaved, but I really 
and truly said to my self, I wonder how mu
ch they know 
about this, and I wonder if 
anyone™s grandfather or great-grandparent was one of those 
SS
 people who did 
awful things, or what Œ what
 they know about it. Because
 for a few years now Œ I Œ 
I mean, y Œ I think now they™re teaching it agai
n in school, but let™s say in the 50s or 
60s, I don™t think th e schools in 
Germany
 were taught Œ taught about the 
Holocaust. I Œ I really don™
t think they were. Oh what
? Yeah, really, does that 
happen? No , not here, kind of a thing. 

Q: Ha-Have you been  to 
Germany
? 
A: I Œ just through it. Not really, I™v
e never Œ well, you 
know, you land in 
Munich
, 
and we took what is called the ro
mantic road. I™d 
like to go to 
Berlin
 because it™s

supposed  to be beautiful. Bu
t not really. But I don™t thin
k it™s on purpose or Œ it just 
hasn™t worked out. I™d rather go to 
Austria
. 
Q: Do you feel Austrian or American? 
A: I feel American, very American. In 
fact, this hyphenated thing, you know, 
Italian-American and so forth, I Œ I just
 think it™s bad. I™m Œ I™m A merican, very 
mu ch so. And I Œ in fact, I think as soon as I went away  from 
New York
, cause I 
went back a lot, because my 
mother was there Œ my sister 
still lives there. But as I 
started 
Miami
 Univ ersity and went 
to college, and entered 
Wellesley 
and so, I was 
Œ was very bent on Œ on Americaniza
tion. I was probably going to  the other 
extreme. I wanted to not have
 an accent, I wanted to Œ 
to be Americanized. And, I 
don™t know, then with American husband, of
 course, he was in the navy, you know, 
and his parents, 
Massachusetts
,
 Boston
. So I Œ I made a real effort the other way, 
maybe Œ maybe to th e extreme, I don™t know.
 But I feel very Am
erican. But when I 
go back to  
Austria
 the Œ the dialect comes back and I Œ I feel very much at home. 
It™s a wonderful feeling. It™s something that
 Œ that is kinda great when you go to a 
foreign country, but it™s not a fore
ign country. It™s very nice.  
Q: Is there anything you want
 to add before we close?
