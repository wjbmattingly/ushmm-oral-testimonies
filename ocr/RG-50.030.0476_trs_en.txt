 June 1, 2003 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Me
morial Museum interview with Gisela Zamora, 
conducted by Amy Rubi n on June first, 2003, in Scar
sdale, New York. This is tape number one, 
side A. If you would just begin by telling me
 your name , and when and where you were born. 
Answer: I am Gisela Zamora. I was born -- my ma
iden na me was Eckstain, in Battenberg unda 
Aida in Germany. 

Q: And tell me  a little bit about Battenberg, and your fa mily. 

A: My mother™s family had lived in Battenberg at
 least for two or three generations. They were 
known as the Lanksdorfs. My mothe r  was a born Ne
uberger, and sh -- I™m sorry, she was an -- a 
born Marx, and the Neubergers ma rried a Lanksdo
rf, and the children al
lcame, more or less 
from that family.  
Q: And wha t  was -- what is -- can you de
scribe Battenberg for some body who™s never -- 
A: Battenberg is a beautiful little 
i -- town, it™s actually
 a village located at
 800 me ters elevation, 
and was considered in Germany sort of a spa,
 what they called Luftcore art. And it had 
approximately, I would say, seven or eight Jewish
 fa milies. My grandfather Marx, Moses Marx, 
came from the Rhineland, Achen, and established 
himself there, ma rried my grandmother, and 
had a -- a shoe business. He sold sh -- shoes a
ll over the area. He went by bicycle many times, 
and we had the -- a regular store at the bo
ttom of our building, which was quite big.  
Q: So this sounds like a very small Jewish community. 
A: Very sma ll Jewish community, definitely. 

Q: And did you know everyone, all the families? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
2 
 
A: We  knew everyone, and some  were even inte
rrelated. I™m in touch with the second cousin, 
that lives across the river, in nua -- Ny
ack, and we see each other occasionally. 
Q: So tell me  a little bit about -- I -- I reme mber you me ntioned 
your father™s work. What -- what 
was your father™s work? 
A: Yeah, my fa -- my mother was introduced to 
my father, she was a youngest daughter of some  
Marx™s, they had six children, th
ree boys, and three girls, and 
she was the youngest, and felt after 
my grandfather passed away, she had to take car
e of her mot her, Beena 
Marx. And Sevra stayed 
in Battenberg. My father was born in Fleet bachin Hesse, sort 
of a s -- bigger town, which was 
what you call a Christstadt in German. And he we
nt to a technical school
 to learn agronomy. 
And he was employed by a ma n na me d Louie Mar
x, who was my mot her™s brother. Ne -- not 

Louie Marx himself, but his -- his firma, whic
h was at that time called Deutsch and Marx or 
some thing like that, I don™t reme mbe r . And Loui
e Marx took my father once up to Battenberg, 
and this way my mother met hi m, and th
ey became  engaged, and ma rried in 1926. 
Q: So tell me  about you. 

A: So my fa ther, who was an academic ma n, ha d 
during the early years a very good job with the 
Whymara governme nt, inst -- instructing the farm
ers how to slaughter, wh
en to slaughter, the 
right time to sow, or to reap, because Germ
any was very much interested in having a good 
agricultural f -- f -- what you woul
d call a me thod, to feed it™s people without too mu ch imports 

at that time . But in 1933, when Hitler came to 
power, my father lost  his job, because he was 
governme nt employed. And he took over my fath -- my
 grandfather™s shoe bus
iness, but at that 
time already, it was going downhill, and he couldn™t really ma ke a very good living fr om that. So 

this went through a couple of months, even I 
would say a year or two, and the anti-Semitism 
came to Battenberg very early. It wa
s really a nest -- I call it a real
 nest of Nazis, and trying to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
3 
 
get rid of all the Jews, and specia
lly confiscate thei r business. So 
my mo --  my father decided it 
was better for him, and for us, for the fa mily, 
to move to Friedberg 
where his parents had a 
home . At that time  in the Judengasser, whic
h was at -- at very early time s in the 16
th
 century, 
ghetto. But it was quite a nice lit
tle street, the houses were one on 
the -- one on the other, and we 
had the three floor house, my father put in plum
bing, which by that time they didn™t have there. 
And we children, I had a brother by the way, hi
s name  was Norbert, who was born two years 
after me , in 1930, went to school in Bard No
wheim, which was a spa approxima tely three 
kilome ters from Friedberg and had a Jewish cabea
rks -- ca -- gami nda shula, excuse me. A -- a s 
-- a school that took in a
ll the children from the surrounding ar
ea. It was located in a beautiful 
area, and had very good reputation as 
a -- a school of first class. A
nd we went to this school till 
1938, I would say -- ™39, I™m sorry.  
Q: Do you mi nd if I ba ck up for a mome nt? 

A: Yes. 
Q:  I wanted to ask you, just in brief, to descri
be the personalities of your
 fa mily. Your parents, 
and you had one sibling, your brother. 
A: Yes. We ll, unfortunately we were children, di
dn™t realize the difficult times my parents went 

through, especially raising us, bri
nging in the money to send us to school, and to feed us and so 

on. My mot her was very fragile, but my father wa
s a very strong ma n. He was an officer in the 
first World War, so he was wounded, and had a 
paralysis on the right hand, and the right arm 
was completely stiff. He was wonderful, he was 
able to do everything with his left. And ma de 
sure that we children go to school, was -- got very
 disciplined, and my moth
er sort of was weak 
in this. And we -- when we wanted some thing, we
 always went to our father, especially me . I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
4 
 
cannot talk to -- about my -- my brother, we so
rt of at that time  were very young, and had ma ny 
little fi ghts, or spat
s, I would call them. 
Q: And you reme mber Battenberg even though 
you were young, you remember living there? 
A: I reme mb er very much living there, and I 
loved the area, because it™s in a what™s called 
Throwtargabeerga in German, and on the Aida, 
which was the biggest -- had the biggest dam, 
about 10 kilome ters away in Germ
any. As a ma tter of fact, it was 
just finished when Hitler  was 
in power, and he ma de a lot of 
propaganda for it. He wanted to imitate the Hoover dam at that 
time.  

Q: Did you have also, non-Je
wish friends there?  It -- 

A: Definitely. I have a non-Jewish friend who is 
writing me  regularly, we are in contact. But we 
only got in contact three years a
go when I went back to Battenbe
rg just to see the town, and I 
didn™t recognize it, it had changed so much.  

Q: But you also -- you also reme mb er anti-Semitic incident s?  
A: Very -- yes. The one thing we had there, we had a neighbor who was -- his name  wa s George, 
I don™t reme mber his last name , he threw stone
s into our windows all the time , and we had 
constantly to repair windows. They were -- a
nd we children were persecuted. We  ha d to walk 
approximately one and a half miles to school, I w
ould say, since we lived on the upper part of the 
town, and the ch -- the school was 
in the lower part. So children 
were already throwing stones at 
us, and we were ostracized. As a matter of fact, at
 the end they put us in
 the back row in school, 
next to the Gypsies. 

Q: And did you feel -- you were very young, 
I mean, ma ybe you can remi nd me  how old you 
were by the time you left Battenberg, but you 
-- you felt this impending persecution. 

A: I felt this very much. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
5 
 
Q: Right.  
A: I -- I -- I felt this per -- pers
ecution, and an incident happene
d, I should really not tell this 
here, but it™s -- since th
ese Gypsies sat next to 
us, there were two boys, they all the time exposed 
themselves towards us, and played around with thei
r sex organ, and that left
 a terrible impression 
on me  all my life. And there was one Jewish 
-- one non-Jewish boy, who was the son of the 
physician in the town, who went up to the teacher
 and told her, and she actually did nothing 
about it, because she was part of 
the Nazi party. But my father realized it™s time that we have to 
go. And since our immi gration was pulled here, and 
pulled there, because of
 my father™s injury 
during the first World War, it was s -- rejected
 by the US at that time , and we tried other 
countries, and you needed an awful lot of mone
y, and since my father was not employed since 
1933, it was very difficult. We  lived really, on a 
very wealthy aunt, who send us money and -- 

and bought us clothing, and 
helped us all along, as long as she could. 
Q: How old were you when you left Battenberg? 
A: 10 years. Wait a mi nute, yes,
 I was born twen -- 10 years. 
Q: So at that time your family was aware enough 
of what was happening, or what seemed to be 
happening, to try to emi gra
te, to try to leave. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And -- and couldn™t, and then
 the next step was to go -- 
A: To Friedberg. 

Q: To Friedberg. So what are your me mories 
of living there?  How different was it from 
Battenberg? 

A: It was much more -- less tense, and much mo
re liberal in a way. And 
there were a couple of 
half Jewish people, fami lies, that
 helped us during the night. We 
had -- my father was a -- a -- a -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
6 
 
- a special person to an old woma n, who was in he
r 70™s at that time . She came in the mi ddle of 
the night to bring us some  food. She was very di 
-- attached to my father. And the town itself is 
larger, it™s like White Plains, New York. As a ma
tter of -- see, it was a -- it™s county seats -- the 
county seat of Hesse, Nassaw.  
Q: Tell --  

A: Actually Hesse, 
not Nassaw, Hesse. 
Q: Tell me  a little bit about your fami ly™s connect
ion to holidays, religious holidays. How -- how 
was that in your home, was that --  

A: My mother was very observant of the Jewish
 laws, and she cooked kosher, and ub -- I would 
not say that it was overly kosher, bu
t my father was very mu ch on th
e other side, since he used to 
go to farmers, and they used to give him pork and sausages when he was an agronomist and 

worked for the government. So he didn™t believe in
 any of these dietary laws. And some ti me s he 
took us children along, and we tasted pork, and he
 said, ﬁDon™t tell your mom.ﬂ The first thing 
when we came into the house, naturally ch
ildren say, ﬁDo you know whe r e we went?  Daddy 
took us to this and this farmer, and we had 
a wonderful bratwurst.ﬂ And my mother almost 
exploded. But those were incidents 
that were still pretty good. And i -- when we were then in 
Friedberg, my father had a lot of friends. School 
friends, and he was a good athlete. He used to 
play very good football, and he us
ed to belong to a league, and some
 of the Germans that tried to 
contact us -- or contact him, did so. Bu
t it got less and less as time goes on. And -- 
Q: And tell me -- and tell me a little bit also 
about -- about religious holidays for your family. 
A: Well -- 
Q: And your favorite ones, what -- what you reme mber.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
7 
 
A: I don™t know if they didn™t 
leave any spa -- the favorite on
e was probably Passover. We ll, 
naturally Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. At that
 time I was too imma ture to know what it is. 
Now, in my old age, I™m searching for my b
ackground, and for different, 
and look into different 
religions, and I™m compa r ing it to, specially 
Yoga, Redunta and Buddhism. 
I™m very much into 
that right now.  
Q: So -- so now your fa mily -- and tell me  the 
year when you moved to -- to Friedberg, tell me  

also about you going to sc
hool in -- in Friedberg. 
A: We  -- we -- well, we went to school in Ba
d Nauheim, we t ook the train every morning, which 
was only 10 mi nutes. And the schools there was al
so a children™s home, where children who -- 

who pa -- whose parent s were already separated, 
or immi grated some place. It had a children™s 
home, but at the same time it took all the child
ren by -- how would you call it, comi ng there from 
the surrounding area. You didn™t have 
to live in this children™s home 
to go to that school. It was 
called the besere -- Bitseerik shula. That mean
s of the whole county, Jewish children could come  
by train, by bus, whatever. And I reme mber I ha
ve a very good friend, Eva Forest, whose -- 
whose ma iden name  wa s Wa rburg. She was brought
 by limousine still, si
nce she was a relative 
of the Wa rburgs, a wealthy Jewish family. 

Q: And whe n was this?  What year now? 

A: I would say it was ™38, ™39 and maybe beginning 
of ™40, but then they 
closed that school, the 
Nazis closed the school, 
and if you wanted to further our e-ed
ucation, we had to get to Frankfurt 
amine. So through the joint Jewish community 
of the German gu -- [indecipherable] German 
Reich, at that time, ma de sure that children that
 didn™t have the means to lodge there, to place 

them in homes, and also children™s home s. And 
I would say we went there in beginning of ™40 
for about a year and a half, which was a wonderf
ul experience. Frankfur
t is a big city, very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
8 
 
liberal for Ge rman standards. It was always ag
ainst the -- the Kaiser, and had some pr ominent 
non-Nazis. So some of t he Jewish institutions 
were still working, and one of them is the 
philanthrop -- was the philanthropine, the school th
at was boser [indecipherable] and a -- a part 
of the school taught even in English, you couldget your diploma in English, and regular German 

folkshula. Ma -- my husband, by the way, has adiploma, or let™s say high school f -- liseum 

diploma from philanthropine in Frankfurt.  

Q: Oh he -- 

A: He was several years ol
der than I was, so -- 

Q: So you never me t there? 

A: No, never. He was seven years older than I was.  

Q: So we™re already up to 1940, it sounds like. Ca n we go back for a mo me nt, and can you tell 

me  did you -- do you have recollections in 1938 of Kristallnacht? 

A: Oh definitely, I reme mber that, and so well. 
In the morning they came for my father, and he 
was rounded up with a lot of me n to Buchenwal
d, which we later found out that, we didn™t know 
at that time . And my mother, si
nce we had that three story build
ing, had a big attic, my mother 
put us all the way up into the attic
, and said, ﬁYou be very quiet wh
en they come  here.ﬂ And they 
did come , but they never went the s -- above th
e second floor, but they threw out all our -- my 
mother had a lot of mi esen, and porc -- other por
celain, crystal, threw it out of the windows. 
De molished the dining room, and living room, sor t
 of furniture threw out of the window. But 
physically we  were not apprehended, because fi
rst of all they never knew where we children 
were, and weren™t interested. A
nd my mother, I have no recollec
tion where she st ayed. She must 
have stayed on the third floor al
so, and just watched. But my  fath
er was gone for about four and 
a half weeks, till he came back from Buchenwal
d. And I reme mber my mother preparing a bath 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
9 
 
for him. At that time we didn™t 
have bathrooms like here, except
 we had a flush toilet. And she 
made hot water in a sink ba -- ba
si n, and washed my father from top to head, because he was 
smelling so much. And the -- we continued to liv
e in Friedberg during all this time , going to 
school in Frankfurt, and my parents living in Fr
iedberg, comi ng occasionally to Frankfurt to visit 
us, to see how we are doing. And also on vacation time we went home. And in 1940, or ™41 -- I 

have a friend who could -- who knows the exac
t date, but I don™t -- I don™t reme mber .  
Q: That™s okay. 

A: The schools were closed, all Jewish schools, 
all education to all J-Jewish people wa s -- was 
eliminated. 

Q: How did you -- how did you feel not only then, 
but also after Kristallnacht, after what your 
father went through, how do you remember -- 

A: I was -- 

Q: -- personally feeling? Did you feel that things
 were getting worse?  Ho
w did you feel about it? 
A: I did not realize this, and we
 were too young to realize it. I 
was barely 14, my brother was 12. 
So we felt it in a way, but not really that it -- it harmed us in a way. We still had Jewish children 

to play with, till later on everybody immigrated and very few children were left. That was the 

greatest thing that I feel 
now is that was very sad, that I had 
nobody to play with, to talk to. Only 
my brother. 

Q: When did that happen? 

A: During the year ™40, ™41, that was sad 
time, and people stil
l could immi grate. 
Q: So do you reme mber your father telli
ng you about what happened at Buchenwald? 

A: Never, never, he -- they were absolutely don™
t tell the children. My mother and my father kept 
this from us. They were very protective. I w
ould never have known. I 
didn™t know till I myself 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
10 
 
ended up in Auschwitz, how these things mi ght ha
ve been. The one thing that happened during 
that time, my father was one of 12 children, and he
 had a brother, the olde
st brother really, who 
was ma rried to a non-Jew, because he learned 
watch ma king in Switzerland, and he me t this 
woma n, and got her pregnant, and my grandfat
her insi -- my grandmother insisted on him 
ma rrying this girl. And she came to us in 19 -- go
es back to 1920 -- ™28, I guess. I wasn™t even 
born yet. So she was part of the fa mily, and he was with my f -- my uncle was with my  father in 
Buchenwald, and he was the first one to be killed 
there. They send his ashes to his wife , who was 
Swiss born, and all her children, the children that 
they had, had half Swiss citizenship, so they 
couldn™t do anything to them, they survived.  

Q: And did you hear at the time how 
he was killed, or what happened? 
A: Yes, somehow or other we 
heard about it, as -- as chil
dren, but it didn™t ma ke muc h 
impression. 

Q: I mean, it seems like you were still young en
ough that you didn™t really know how to 
understand all these 
things happening. 
A: That™s right, that™s right. 

Q: And school was generally -- when you were 
still in school, was it a good and positive --  
A: A very positive experience , because I was with only Jewish children. 

Q: And did you still have non-Jewish friends otherwise, at the time? 

A: No, not -- not at that time
 any mor e . A-Also, there was a half-Jewish couple, he was non-
Jewish, and she was Jewish, but they were -- were 
Communis t s, very Leftist, and he was, at one 
time in the Wymar Republic, like a 
delegate to the Congress in Berlin. And they came to see us, 
and he was not afraid. He  was a non-Jew, his wi
fe was a Jewish woma n. He was not afraid of 
them, and he had ma ny bouts with them -- the N
azis and at the end he was also brought to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
11 
 
Dachau, but he survived. And I lived with them 
till I came to this countr
y. To -- with him, his 
wife was killed. But that™s after the war. 
Q: Okay, so you were going to school in Frankfur
t, your family was still living in Freidburg at 
the time? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And you were not separated from them, or 
you were, you were living with another fa mily? 
A: I wa -- at first I was in the children™s home, a
nd then they placed us in families, because they -

- they had such an overflow in the kinderheim, that they had to take -- they had to get Jewish 

fa mily that had enough room, were wealthy, to take in some  of these children. So I came  to one 

wealthy fa mily in the west end 
of Frankfurt who owned a -- a pala
tial home , which was naturally 
confiscated while I was there, 
by the Nazis, and they had --

Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum interview with Gisela 
Zamora. Thi s is tape one, side B. Okay, contin
ue to tell me  about the family you were living 
with. Also, will you tell me  --  

A: Say -- 

Q: -- when this was, and how long you were se
parated from your own family, not living with 
them? 

A: We ll, I was never separated really, only by sma
ll di stances at that time
. I still could go home. 
It meant you had to take a train from Frankfurt 
to Friedberg, which was 
possible. Even so, we 
were -- we wore the star, the yellow star alread
y, and we had to be s-sitting in a certain 
compart ment. And it was very shameful for us 
kids, some how. I mean, we were a little bit 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
12 
 
intimidated, sitting where we were sitting. And -- but
 what I reme mber about this family is they 
had a housekeeper who came from Battenberg, a
nd she had a terrible nervous condition, and 
shook with her hands, and her head, and this is 
now comi ng into my mi nd when I think about 
myself getting old, and some times I have these anxiet
y attacks, and I start to shake a little bit, 
and that brings me  back to that time. 
Q: What was her name? 

A: Selma Le rmenstein. I don™t think she survived.  

Q: So this family, their home  was conf
iscated, what did you th
ink at that time ?  
A: They went to Theresienstadt where we were
 transported at that time too, in 1942. But before 
that, they already -- since the schoo
ls were closed, they already were
 placed in a -- an -- an old 
age home, more or less, and I don™t know what 
happened to Selma Ler menst-stein. We children 
came back home , and waited for deportation. 

Q: And wha t  do you reme mber, whe n did you start -- when did you need -- when were you 
forced to wear the -- the Star of
 David, the -- and it was a yellow? 
A: It was yellow star, with black 
rim. We ll we -- we had to, as soon as we went to school in Bad 
Nauheim, already we had that ta --
 I think in 1939, right away when
 this -- before the war yet. I 
would say ™39, after the war with Poland had st
arted. It came  s l owly, everything came slowly. 
My mother had to part with her fur coat, with 
her silver, and her jewelr
y. Every year there was, 
or every couple of months there was a raid that
 you had to bring certain
 things for the possible 
war that they are going to fight ag
ainst the allies. And this was a 
very hard thing for my mother, 
to -- dawa -- to part with ma terial possessions
. I think I learned from that. I am giving away 
already now ma ny of my  possession
s, and I am very grateful 
that I had a husband who ma de 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
13 
 
good money during his career, and I 
had a nice ho me, but I know that I will have to leave it, and 
I™m trying to learn non-attach
me nt to ma terial things. 
Q: Did your -- did you -- did you learn very much
 about the beginning of the war in Poland?  
What did you learn, and -- and when? 
A: We -- we weren™t allowed to listen to any fo
reign stations, but this
 Communist, this -- who 
was ma rried to a Jewish wife, used to come  and 
tell my father what was sa id, because he was 
listening clandestinely, apparentl
y, in -- in a group of people, and used to tell him what  
happened. But at that time the Germans ma de big 
progress into Poland, then into France, and by 
that time a lot of Jews were al r
eady deported to the east, and we we
re lucky to be there yet till 
™40 -- lucky?  I wouldn™t say lucky -- till Sept
ember ™42, when we were rounded up. And as I 
said, our luck was that my father was an officer
 in the first World Wa r, and he had the Purple 
Cross, the Ge rman ahtler, and whe -- we were priv
ileged to go to Theresienstadt. And needless to 

say, for my parents it was a very terrible thing, 
but we children didn™t re
alize what it meant for 
them. We  ca me  to Theresienstadt, and we saw a 
lot of children, and we were able to play, and 
congregate with them, and that was very im
portant for my psyche, because I was so 
excommunicated from -- from children in Germany, le
t™s say, or separated. I don™t find the right 
word I want to express. 

Q: So you -- you actually felt initially, when you were 
at Theresienstadt that things felt a little bit 
better for you? 

A: Mu -- yes, better for me , and at -- the good th
ing was that my father, since he was also an 
academic, and he had a background in the Whymara gove
rnment that he got a job in the Judenrat 
in Theresienstadt, which was a big privilege. 
Also, he was a very mi nor, mi nor official. My 
mother used to say he probably has to sweep the 
floors of the -- of the Judenrat, of the bigshots

there. That™s about all that -- bu
t that enabled him for us, between
 my brother and myself, to get 
us into kinderheim. At first we thought we
 both were going to go to the kinderheim, but 
somehow or other there was such
 an overflow of children they 
didn™t have enough room, so we 
had to choose between -- my parents had to c
hoose between my brother 
and myself, and they 
decided that I should go to the kinderheim.  
Q: Do you know why they decided that? 

A: I have no idea, my -- I -- I 
couldn™t get along with my mother
 so well, like girls do with -- 
some ti me s, with mothers. My father thought that
 I was the older one, that
 I should go. That was 
actually for me  a wonderful experience, since f
ood was naturally the first thing on our mi nd, but 
being with the same  group of people, being able
 to communi cate it, to learn. Because in the 
kinderheim, every room had a sort of a teacher 
that had to ke ep us busy. And I reme mb ered we 
had a girl name d Hoyma n -- Eta Hoyman, she wa
s very well known in Germany in the Zionist 
move me nt. And she read books with us, we learne
d history of Palestine, and it was a very good, 
wonderful experience. However, it didn™t last, 
like nothing lasts. Unfortunately, my brother 
during that time  beca me  sick with typhus andwas quarantined. My moth
er was terribly upset 

about it, and I had to try to chee
r her up a little bit here and ther
e, and I have ma de acquaintance 
with a pianist in Theresienstadt, and she was in 
the entertainment part, and she got us tickets to 
various performances. And my moth
er liked it very much, and I used to go with her in the 
afternoons or evenings.  

Q: So there were certain cultural activities? 

A: Yes, only in Theresienstadt. It was the --
 as everybody knows, the camp that they -- the 

ghettos that was open to show how
 well the Jews were treated. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
15 
 
Q: What are your first recollections of seeing, or
 meeting Nazis, even before, perhaps, before 
going to Theresienstadt? 
A: I -- my mother always said, ﬁAs soon as you 
see these black shirts, or the brown shirts 
marching down the main street,ﬂ in Battenberg when
 we were small, because that  was a nest of 
Nazis, ﬁyou come  straight into
 the house.ﬂ They -- they put 
a -- a fear into
 us children. 
Q: And did you have any pers
onal interactions you recall? 

A: Only as I said, when we walked to the sc
hool in the morning, ma ny 
time s children of -- of 
Nazis were trying to persecute us
, and hit us, and -- but some how or other, I had sort of a lucky 
star, and I don™t remember the re
al bad, bad, bad episodes, except th
at at night we always were 
afraid to go to sleep, because of th
e stones that came  into the window. 
Q: And that was still in Battenberg. 

A: That was still in Battenberg, 
in Fr iedberg that never happened. 
Q: And also later di -- in your 
-- in the schools you were attend
ing, I read some thing once that 
said the Gestapo was already monitoring these sc
hools, like in Frankfurt the school you attended. 
Did you -- did you see any officials -- 
Nazi officials around your schools? 
A: I don™t reme mber, I really don
™t reme mber, but it could we ll be
. I have a book here from the 
phila -- about the philanthropine, 
and ma ybe we can look it up. 
Q: I was just curious if any of that -- you know, if you reme mbered. 

A: No, I don™t remember  that, I only reme mber that
 in the last few months
 I did not go to school 
any more, I stayed home with my parents, and I 
helped out in a old age 
home , washing floors, I 
was 14, and they ma de me  scrub the floors. Had to kneel down -- was backbreaking work for a 

14 year old. 

Q: And that was after you we
re no longer allowed to go? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
16 
 
A: Na -- just -- it™s a school. Betw
een ™41 and ™42, til
l our deportation. 
Q: So when you were deported, what did you know a
bout what was about to 
happen at that time?  
What were you aware of at the mo me nt that they 
-- you know, describe to me  sort of that -- that 
particular part of your ex
perience of being deported. 
A: The de -- de -- deportation was a horrible expe
rience because we were a
ll taken to a point in 
Darmstardt, which is south of Frankfurt, a ma
jor city, and apparently they had Quonset huts 
there, and they rounded up all th
e Jews from the arou -- surrounding 
areas, all the people from 
Hesse, Frankfurt, and the bigger cities nearby. A
nd we were sort of divided in groups, and it 
depended on your status in Germany,
 and as I said, my father had th
at luck, that we -- wasn™t the 
luck for him, unfortunately, he lost his life, but 
that we were on the -- so
 that we are put on the 
side to go to Theresienstadt. His 
brother -- and we were very close 
to them, this -- this is not the 
same  brother as the one that was killed in Buch
enwald -- well, that wa
s really later -- a younger 
brother, who lived in Bad Nauheim with his fam
ily, they had two boys, and they were put on the 
side to go to the east. And my father tried everythi
ng to -- for them to be with us, but it didn™t -- 
he couldn™t do anything about it. So then the ac
tual, when we find -- I don™t know what we ate 
there, I™ve no idea what -- what the rations were
. The rations in Germany already were very poor. 
For us poorer than for the genera
l public, but we -- we depended on potatoes, cabbage, and what 
do you call these?  Halloween --  
Q: Oh, pumpkins? 

A: Pumpkins. I mean, they were not like -- they 
were not quite as big 
as pumpkins, but some  
kind of -- 

Q: Like a turnip? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
17 
 
A: Like a turnip, that™s right, it 
was a turnip, a sort of a winter 
vegetable that you could still s -- 
keep over the window, and the Germans had warehous
es of these things, a
pparently. Potatoes by 
the -- they had to, because they had nothing else. 
And finally, two or three days later, we were 
put into a -- a -- into 
a railroad. Naturally the -- what do 
you call them, the wagons that had no 
windows, and they are used for transport 
of good and animals. And we got taken to 
Theresienstadt.  

Q: What did you bring with you?  
Wh at were you able to bring? 
A: We  had each a -- a -- I would say s -- we
 were allowed certain amount of pounds, I don™t 
reme mber, ma ybe 50 pounds in the suitcases. Food, 
my mot her packed up some  food, clothing, 
and everybody, we had to carry our own. My pare
nts -- my father ke -- tried to carry my 
brother™s package, whatever, and we came to Theresienstadt with our own clothes yet. Whatever 

we could take along. We  left ma ny things behind. 

Q: And whe n was this? 
A: In 1940 -- September 1942. 
Q: And how long did you stay -- you were firs
t taken to -- it was sort
 of a transit center? 
A: [indecipherable] centers -- transi
t center, that ™s exa -- darmshtart. 
Q: And how long you were there? 

A: I wouldn™t s -- I don™t reme mber, ma ybe a we ek or two.  

Q: And from there?  And people were take
n from there to different places -- 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- and from there you were
 taken to Theresienstadt. 
A: Theresienstadt, that™s right. 

Q: And the trip itself you reme mber pretty
 vividly, or is it hard to reme mbe r? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
18 
 
A: Yes, I reme mber it was a beautiful fall day, and some how or other, I 
-- I looked out -- I don™t 
know if it had windows, or just holes, and I 
saw the landscape, I was very much impre ssed, 
because he went along the Elba, down to S-Sudate
nland, which is today C
zechoslovakia. It was a 
beautiful, scenic area, always was impressed by 
nature, because Battenberg was such a beautiful, 
beautiful situated town.  
Q: So -- and you didn™t know where 
you were headed at that point? 

A: No, I didn™t know. When we arrived -- I don™t know, ma ybe my parent
s knew, but I doubt it. 
When we got to Theresienstadt, we we re all put
 into a -- a compound, and my father, as usual, 
was able to get to a compound wh
ere there were prominent Jews, like lawyers, and professionals. 
They sort of had this all divi
ded there. And we stayed on the 
floor, and we had straw sacks to 
sleep on, ma ybe -- it depended on the room how ma ny 
peopl e, 20 - 25, and that is not very nice.  
Q: And how long were you st
aying in that situation? 
A: As -- when -- when my father finally -- I woul
d say about less than a ha
lf a year. Then I was 
able to get to the kinderheim.  
Q: So for the first six months at Theresiens
tadt, you were in these cramped, crowded living 

conditions?  

A: Yes, definitely, and there we
re a lot of Slovakian Jews, Czech
s Jews, and Jews from all parts 
of Ger many, some  Austrians, and later on we al
so had Dutch Jews. And 
some how or other there 
was ill-feelings some times between this Jews, wh
ere they came from, what they did, and so on 

and so forth. I have to think 
of this today, cause huma nkind does not learn from -- from these 
things, apparently. It continues,
 and continues in this world.  
Q: So you were able to stay with your fa mily, together? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
19 
 
A: Yeah, together till I was put into the na --
 kinderheim, which was ju
st a couple of blocks 
away, but that was a revelation for me , and I loved 
the learning ther e. It  -- it was something that -
- and spiritually it helped me to be with othe
r Je wish children, en ma sse. There was competition 
in school, in writing, in reading, and knowing cer
tain answers and so on. And I always had a 
drive to be -- I had a bi g ego to be on top, 
whatever, which naturally I had competitions there 
very much, but it kept me alive. 
Q: The first half year, wa s it depressing to you? 

A: Yes, because a lot of the old people around us
 passed away. They just couldn™t take  it. And 
we saw that, even in our room, and e very morn
ing some body was sick, had even -- had diarrhea, 
and it smelled, or vomiting, and awful -- awful thi
ngs. This was very, very bad for us children, 
but since I later on decided in th
is country to be working in th
e me dical profession, when I think 
about this now, it really is
 part of human suffering.  
Q: So you were -- you were in the kinderheim, 
you were feeling -- I think you wrote that it was 
an intellectually prosperous, or fruitful -- 

A: [indecipherable] time. 

Q: -- time  for you. And it sounds like what you were
 able to learn there was not censored, or 
restricted, it sounds like -- 

A: No, it was between ourselves, since we ha
d Eta Hoyman, we learned a lot of -- about 
Palestine, the history of the Zionist moveme nt, and 
she wanted to inflame in all of us a desire to 
go to the home land of the Jews.  

Q: Did you feel that in
terest, and -- and -- 
A: Unfortunately, I don™t know. 
I -- I did and I didn™t.  
Q: But you still enjoye
d learning everything? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
20 
 
A: I enjo-joyed learning and reading classi cal nove
ls. She read to us every night for at least an 
hour. And some  of the children, naturally didn™t pay 
attention, but I was ther
e, I -- I couldn™t pull 
myself away from that. 
Q: And did you get involved in any cu
ltural performa nces
 or activities? 
A: I don™t think so, I had a -- a flair for gardening,
 so they selected me  to work in what they 
called the [indecipherable] garden. And I had a 
girlfriend, passed away not
 so long ago, we both 
were working there, we raised, for the Nazis na
turally, toma toes and spinach, and -- but we were 
able to eat here and there a toma to, when nobody l
ooked. And they noticed that I made very nice 
beds, you know, the flower, not -- the beds for the ve
getables, so they selected me  to rake -- to 
rake the beds nice and straight, and ma ke the m 
four or five inches high from the ground, and so 
on. And that I enjoyed ve ry much. And every night I went home , putting a toma to, or a potato 

under my armpits. If we had been caught, we woul
d have been sent right away to some prison. 
There was a prison nearby, but I br
ought this to my mother, and 
she was forever gr ateful when 
she had something like this, to feed my brother. 

Q: So tell me  your -- your -- 

A: But it was a short time, it was maybe one
 summer, and one fall. Is it finished? 
Q: You want to take a break? 

A: Yes, please. I -- 

Q: I just want to ma ke sure before we contin
ue talking about your expe
riences, would you just 
make sure to tell me the full names of your 
fa mily me mbers, your parents and your brother? 
A: Yes. My fa ther™s na me was Bertholdt Eckstain. My mother™s name  was Bertha Eckstain, born 

Marx, M-a-r-x. My brothe r™s name  was Norbert, N-o-r-b-e-r-t Eckstain. 

Q: And you originally had a mi ddle name , it s
ounds like that was also from your fa mi ly. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
21 
 
A: My mi ddle name  was Bina, B-i-n-a, which 
was my grandmother™s name , on mother™s side. 
Q: And how did you -- and how about your first na
me, did you get that from someone in your 
fa mily? 
A: Yes, I had an aunt, she was more German than
 the Germans, very wealthy woman, ma rried to 
a very wealthy horse dealer, in -- Jewish horse 
dealer in Germany, and she was thinking it should 
be a German name. She had a preference for me. 
She as herself couldn™t get children, so she 
name d me  Gisela. 

Q: And would you say that your family in genera
l was very assimilated into German s ociety? 
A: I would say so. They were very assimilated, es
pecially my mother™s fa
mily. You had to be if 
you lived in a small town. 

Q: Okay, so now to return to I think where we le
ft off, we we re talking about sort of the early 
time period when you were in Theresienstadt, 
and I actually have a ma p, and I would -- I™m 
wondering if you recognize sort of where you were. 
A: I know that I was in L four -- 414 in
 the kinderheim, but before that -- 
Q: This looks like the main square. 
A: Yeah, I understand. And near there wa
s a kine -- it doesn™t say there. 
Q: This ma y not be detailed enough. 

A: Yes, it was on the right side of the kinderheim. 

Q: This apparently -- 

A: [indecipherable] children™s home.  

Q: So when you first arrived, where were
 you in terms of this ma in square? 
A: We  were -- we were in the Hanover barracks 
when we arrived, till I got to the kinderheim, 
which was L fear hundred -- 414, the German kinderheim. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
22 
 
Q: And at that time  you were then separated 
from your parents, or did you see your fa mily? 
A: Oh, I could see them any time. 
It was a little walk to get to 
them, but most of my t i me  was 
spent with the other children. We  we re always 
busy. We  were kept busy 
fro m morning till night. 
Q: And then -- and then you stayed
 in the kinderheim for how long? 
A: Till we were deported. 
Q: So you were there for the rest of the time? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So, in looking at this example of t he ma
p, just so I have a better understanding, were you 
usually -- did you usually stay in a very small 
portion of the overall ar
ea, or did you wind up in 
ma ny different, you know, parts. 

A: Oh, it -- when we we re allowed to go out
 without -- we could go anywheres without 
guardians, Jewish guardians. So we once in awhile 
went just through to the 
ma in square, or went 
to a concert, or some thing that was offered at that time. 
Q: And the garden, you worked
 in a garden, is that? 
A: Yes, I worked -- we worked in the Veshalie
 garden, which is outsi
de the ghetto, we were 
ma rched there, and we were ma rched back. And I -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: And occasionally we™re examined if we t
ook anything into the camp, so everybody was very 
afraid if you took a potato or tw
o, or a toma to or two, or some  
spinach underneath our clothing. 
Q: So -- 

A: That we brought -- I br
ought to my mother, she was very grateful for this. 
Q: So would you tell me  -- 
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is a United Stat es Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview with Gisela Zamora, 
conducted by Amy Rubi n, on June first, 2003, in Scar
sdale, New York. This is tape number two, 
side A. So I was just about to ask you if you coul
d describe to me the dail
y routine or what a -- a 
day was like for you there. I guess we ™re talking 
about the time  that you entered, you know, the 
kinderheim, and -- and you were working in the 
garden. What was a typical day like for you? 
A: We ll, we had to get up early in the morning, 
get our ration of food, wh
atever it was, and we 
had a very string -- string -- strict -- I™m sorry, strict
 teacher, that led us to -- 
in -- in to a sort of a 
circle, we sat down on the floor, and she told us --
 she read to us, and we had naturally, intervals 
where we could go to the bathroom. Many of us
 had diarrhea from the food, from uns anitary 
conditions. We slept too ma ny people in -- on 
one bunk, and usually on the -- on Saturdays we 
were free. And I had my first experience of rela
tionship with the opposite text -- sex. That means 
only platonically. He was a singer from the C
zech opera, and I happened to be, on a ni ce sunny 
day, in a new outfit that my mo
t h e r  ma d e  fo r  me  fr o m s o me  
rags. And I sat myself down on 
some  stones, and there come s this man, sat next 
to me , and I recognized him right away, and told 
him that he was at the opera. So he gave me  a 
kiss, and hugged me . And he promised to be there 
the next week, and unfortunately I arrived, waited 
there for an hour with tears in my eyes, and I 
never saw him again. 

Q: Do you know his name? 

A: I am sorry, I forgot. 

Q: But you had a little crush on him? 

A: I had a crush on him. That was my first crush. 

Q: And how old were you at this time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
24 
 
A: I™m going on 15 -- 
Q: So the f -- 

A: -- or f -- almost 16.  

Q: So -- so you were enjoying yourself in school
, but the food situation was not very good, right? 
A: No, we always were hungry, and if we could 
some how or other catch anywheres a little bit 
extra, that was special.  

Q: And otherwise you saw your fa mi ly in the evenings? 

A: Yes, and some ti me s in the afternoons, and then
 when my f -- my brother got sick with typhus, 

I was not allowed to go there for awhile, because 
it was disinfected, and my mother didn™t want 
me to come there. So I met the m on the outside
 once in awhile. But generally I was so happy and 

-- to be in the kinderheim, that I had not this de
sire that I would have today to see my parents. 
We were young, and so wrapped up with being y
oung, trying to learn and enjoy ourselves. So, 
these horrible things were left sort of not to
 dwell on. We  saw every day wa gons with corpses 
going by, because we were right on the ma in street
, and they were being taken out of the ghetto 
to a ma ss grave. But your -- every day you saw at l
east two or three wagons
 with several people 
in there. Mostly elderly people.  

Q: And did you give mu ch 
thought to it at the time ?  

A: None at all. We  were so -- we were so 
childlike. I think today™s teenagers would think 

different, but we were so ignorant.  

Q: And wha t  did you hear -- I --
 I get the impression that Ther
esienstadt was unusual, that 
some ti me s people could write letters, and send in
for mation from the outside. Did your fa mily -- 
were you aware of your family receivi ng packages or letters? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
25 
 
A: No, we ne -- I don™t think I remember a
nybody sending us packages, because all my fa mily 
from my mother™s side-- 
[phone rings] Ah, I™ m sorry. [indecipherable] where we were. 
Q: Does this ma p look familiar to you, or not very fa miliar, actually? 
A: Not at all. I know the ma in square. 

Q: And this says post office. 

A: Street. 

Q: Street, or [indecipherable] 

A: I don™t reme mber. The only 
thing is ma ybe this -- 
Q: Number 13. 

A: -- teen was what?  SS billets, no. Le t™s see why -- what. 

Q: Let™s see now, ma ybe  if we read this, it mi
ght tell you something th
at you would recognize. 
A: I look -- children™s pa vilion during the embe
llishment. No, that was not [indecipherable] 
Q: That was in preparation for the Red Cross. 
A: Yeah, no, we were put there. We  were taken 
there when they came and inspected us, and we -
- we all were fixed up with beautiful hairdos, 
flowers, and new clothing if -- if they had. 
Q: Did you understand what wa
s happening at that time ?  
A: Not at all. I-I can™t even reme mber. 
Q: But you know that some thing was diffe
rent, you know that you were given -- 

A: Yes, yes, later on we heard that this was an 
inspection for the Red Cross, for the international 
Red Cross.  

Q: And did you meet anybody from 
the Red Cross at that time, 
or see anybody comi ng through?  
Were you aware of their visit? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
26 
 
A: I -- no, I -- a ve -- we -- you kno
w, I was way in the back, and 
there were a lo
t of children, a 
lot of people that they brought there. I think now
 I™m finds it. L -- Main Street. We  were on the 
Main Street. I would say ma ybe here, these tw
o buildings, one was for just Czech, Slovak 
people, and one was for the German Dutch children. 
Q: So when -- so what else do you reme mber, if
 anything about the time period right before -- 
well, when did the Red Cross come  to visit, 
and what do you reme mber about that whole time  
period? 

A: I do remember nothing very much, except that
 I was happy to be in company with my own 
grade -- kind, and I was not a good eater before
 we left Germany, and t hat™s why my -- my 
hunger, probably was not so bad that time . I didn™t f
eel it. Or I felt it, but wh
atever we got at that 
time seemed to be a little bit sufficient, even 
though probably it wasn™t su
ffi cient. But I think it 
was sufficient for me  if t hey ar -- selected me  in Auschwitz to go on labor. 

Q: And you were -- 
A: Even so, I was small, skinny, not very tall compar
ed to a lot of other gi
rls that were hefty, and 
tal -- and robust, muscular and so on.  
Q: So what were your -- what
 were your actual barracks like
, and -- and how crowded were 
they? 

A: We ll, as I said, the barracks where my parent
s were e -- were first brought, where one fa mily 
was put in one little compound, in a corner, next
 to another family, another fa mily, another 
fa mily and so on. And as I said, it was th-the more
 elite part of the ghetto
 that we were brought 
to. There were only lawyers, doctors, and prom
inent people. I reme mber even one of my 
mathematics teacher from Frankfurt with his famil
y, Dr. Naleftchuwitz, that he was right near us, 
across this -- from our compound, the same  bi
g room. Then there was a famous lawyer, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476

Lervenstein, whose daughter Ruth Lervenstein?
 I forgot her first name  now, was a very 
accomplished pianist, and performe d on the stage in
 Theresienstadt, and she took me  to ma ny of 
her concerts. What I remember most
 is that a -- the last night 
before our deportation, my mother 
and I -- that  means my father was deported al re
ady, a month later my mother and I went to a 
performa nce of Hayden™s Creation, and I never will forget that. Next morning we were all 
rounded up for Auschwitz. . 

Q: And the night before you were 
very happy, would you say, or -- 
A: Ah, yeah, it impressed me  very mu ch to hear 
that chorus, and I have 
a ticket to hear it at 
Lincoln Center a -- a -- on August 23
rd
, and I wonder what reaction it gives me . 
Q: So did you have ma ny interactions with any 
of the Nazis overseeing, or
 I believe there were 
some  Czech gendarmes who were also the guards? 

A: Yes, the Czech gen -- gendarmes were with us
 in the Vesherie garden on the outside. On the 
general they were very huma ne, let™s say as humane 
an -- as they could be. They let us work, we 
-- we naturally had to work, but th
ey were not like  the Nazis.  
Q: And you did see Nazis inside Theresienstadt? 

A: I never really -- I don™t reme mber. I really don™t reme mber. 

Q: When -- when were you aware of your 
father leaving?  Did you know beforehand? 
A: No, all of a sudden they said to
mo rrow -- this is -- in this time  
my fathe r  and lots of other me n 
have to be ready to go on labor
 on the outside, and they rounded
 up all younger me n in their 30™s 
and 40™s. My father was at that time  -- born in
 ™93, f -- about 51 or 52, 
but very tall, and not 
overweight, and he was amongst those that were se
lected on this first trip to Auschwitz from 
Theresienstadt, the first me n™s transport. 

Q: And whe n was that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
28 
 
A: August, 1944. 
Q: Had you heard anything about Auschwitz at this point? 

A: Nothing. Maybe it was me ntioned, but nobody c
ould make any il -- illu
stration how it would 
look. I don™t think I heard anything about it. They 
only talked about labor camps for the Reich. 
Q: And you did not know your father was going to Auschwitz? 

A: No, no. As a ma tter of fact, they duped us wh
en one mont h later, they said all wifes and 
children of the men that were transported last 
month will now be able to go to the labor camp, 
and live with their husbands. So it should be an 
enticement to go on this 
trip. I don™t know if my 
mother f -- di d that  out of her fr ee will and re
gistered us, or if we were just  selected. 
Q: Did you have any -- do you reme mber any holid
ays, religious holidays in Theresienstadt? 
A: We ll, as we -- as we had a very Zi onistic, and 
also religious hof
sayren instead of teacher, Et a 
Noyman, a prominent Zionist and Ju
daic scholar, she ma de s ure 
we had a nice celebration on the 
various Jewish holidays.  
Q: So by the time -- oh, I wanted to ask you -- here, 
I can take that -- I wanted to ask you, when 
you were, you know, studying and learning, and this 
was a fruitful time  for you, did you have 
any dreams, or aspirations for what youwould like to do later, as you grew up? 
A: I don™t reme mber, but I was so -- so hungry 
for knowledge, for knowing things. I wa s always 
competitive even in Frankfurt in 
the ha -- in the school we went 
to. And I basically was not a top 
student like my friend Eva Wa r
burg, but I was a good student. 
Q: What were the subjects that you liked the most in school? 

A: Science. I was good in ma thematics. That was my
 father™s influence. He  had us do arithmetic 
when we we re four years old. And I reme mber as 
a child three years, or 
four years old, playing 
around with w, because I liked that
 letter, and ma de out two v™ s and turned it around to ma ke an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
29 
 
m. All these things, and the n, I ma de into a 
u upside down. And those we
re sort of -- I think 
ingenious ideas that not
 every child has.  
Q: And -- and you were -- it wasn™t necessari
ly every other child around you who wa s as hungry 
for knowledge, right?  It was sort of unusual. 
A: N-No, no, that™s true. But I sought out 
those kids that had the same  interest. 
Q: And who were your closest friends 
at that time in Theresienstadt? 
A: As I said, Eva Hashkowitz Goodman, who ju
st published a book in German. Ouse wonderum 
forloifish nish me rklish. She was a good friend of 
mi ne, and it was by coincidence that we were -
- me t again in Auschwitz, and she gave me  a half a 
loaf of bread, and I™ll never, never forget that. 
Q: Any other good friends in [indecipherable] 

A: Oh yeah, I had a lot of good friends in Ther
esienstadt that came  from my neighborhood in 
Friedberg. Her name was Ruth Wertheim. She ma rri
ed a Mitchell Bakehow, a lawyer in Detroit -
- in Pontiac, Michigan. And we 
were lifelong friends. She saved my
 life on several occasions in 
Auschwitz by being like a 
mother, very protective. 
Q: Before you were sent to Auschwitz, you 
also had another job in Theresienstadt. 

A: Yes, I was washing children™s di apers in cold
 water. I remember it was fiercely cold that 
winter, and my hands used to freeze, and I™m su
rprised I don™t have any 
frostbites or anything. 
That was part of my job. 

Q: You did that outside in the winter? 

A: We  did it -- we -- I don™t reme mbe r . No, we
 did that inside, but no heat. Cold water only. 
Q: Oh, and in -- in your living a
rrangements after you were with 
your parents all together, then 
you are with other young wo
me n your age, and -- 
A: Yes, a -- as I said, the twins -- the Ha
shkowitz twins were on my ps -- on my bunk. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
30 
 
Q: And was it very uncomfortable, was everybody crowded in?  Wa s it hard to -- 
A: We sort of maked go -- do. I don™t reme mber 
that, but I know we suffered from the -- from 
lice, and from bedbugs. Bedbugs were s -- 
I was terribly allergic to bedbugs. 
Q: What happened to you? 

A: Oh, my - -  my body was full of pustules. They tr
eated us with disinfectant, whatever they had, 
but that was not enough, it was so endemi c. And th
e lice, they were all over our head, and no 
washing and cleaning coul
d bring that out. So this was one bad thing. 
Q: But everything got better for a little while 
when the Red Cross was going to come , and then 
did things change back to the sort of norma l, the Jewish -- 

A: Yes, and right away after that really, th
e deportations from Th
eresienstadt started. 
Q: So the day that you we re deport
ed, what do you reme mber that day? 
A: It was in September, 
I think it was September 17
th
, and my  mother said, ﬁIt must be Rosh 
Hashanah,ﬂ when our -- Rosh Hashanah just pass
ed. I don™t reme mber exactly what she said, and 
we were together in wagons again, coal wagons, 
or whatever they were, and taken to Auschwitz. 

That was a terribl e trip. There was one pail where 
we could go and defecate and urinate, and at 
some  stations the SS came , and somebody had it to empty them. Then the trip went on, and it 

took about two or three days to li
 -- to get to Auschwitz. Luckily, it was cool, and we didn™t need 
too much water. But I reme mber that sitting in
 the -- in -- in the mi
ddle of the wagon, without 
any backrest, or so on, was very painful. My 
mother must have suffered tremendously, because 
when I think about my back now, and it™s -- both
er it gives me , I think back how these older 
people suffered. 

Q: Did you eat, or have
 anything to drink? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
31 
 
A: I don™t reme mber, but as I said, my moth
er took some  things along, probably, because 
everything was confiscated in Auschwitz then. 
But till we got to Auschwitz, we did have 
some thing. I don™t reme mber what it was. 
Q: And were you scared?  What did you think? 

A: T -- well, I wasn™t scared, just ignorant, we 
all were ignorant. Maybe 
the older people knew, 
but basically I wonder what other 
testimonials people give if they
 have -- young people, if they 
have had i -- any idea what would happen. 

Q: I think it seems that most of the time people 
either didn™t know, or coul
dn™t believe that this 
would be truly happening. 

A: That™s right. I could -- I could no
t believe. I absolutely was stunned. 
Q: So when you arrived, what did you see? 

A: I never saw the crematorium, that was later on poi
nted out to me , after we were in -- in -- in 
our bunks already. But we were on this platform
, and Mengele ma kes the selection, and my -- 
my mother, my brother were taken fr om me. I 
was taken t-to the othe
r side, and luckily my 
friend Ruth Wertheim was there, and we two held 
hands, and kept together, and were put into the 
same  barrack, slept on the same  bed. There we 
met another girl. Her name was Hannah Laura 
Breaker. She immi grated to Isr
ael a long, long time ago. And the s
econd time I came  to Israel, 
she had passed away already. She was very much taken, and suffered greatly from her 

experience. She took it in very, very much, and I 
think that led her to an
 early death. Also my 
friend Ruth Hershkowitz Goodma n, and her sister -- 
can™t think of her name
. I™ll look it up after. 
The twins. Not identical twins. Sh
e also was selected to our area, 
but sin- since they were twins, 
were taken out to be with -- for experime ntati
on. But some how or other they had the luck that 
Mengele left -- let them be for la
st, and used them as me ssengers. So
 that they were able to get a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
32 
 
little bread here and there, and once when I me
t Ruth Hershkowitz on the way out of Auschwitz, 
she gave me  a half a loaf of bread, and she me ntions it in her book. 
Q: Did -- did you know this -- this doctor
 was name d Mengele at the time, or -- 
A: No, no, not at all, didn™t know.  

Q: It™s much later when you learned. 

A: Yes, who know -- knew anythi
ng. We knew our -- when we got to the labor camp, we knew 
the German woman that was our -- a -- a real terr
ible bitch, if I can say that she was. Inhuma n. 

Inhuman and how would I say, a -- had no scruples
 whatsoever to hit us, or to kill us, or 
whatever. She always wore a revolver in 
her polster, and was r
eady to shoot anybody. 
Q: And who was she?  Who -- what™s her name? 

A: That wa -- I don™t remember her name. I thi
nk her first name was Ilsa. I only reme mber when 
we were liberated by the Russians, some  of th
e Polish girls in the labor camp took her and 
shaved her hair, and gave her over to the Russian
s. I don™t know what happened to her. I was too 
si ck at  t h at  ti me.  

Q: I wanted to go back for a mo me nt , one thi
ng I didn™t get a chance to
 ask you. Whe n you were 
still in Germany, and growing up, and moving from 
one place to the other, once Hitler came to 
power, or even right before that, what -- wh
at was your awareness of Hitler? Had you been 

hearing anything he said over the 
radio?  Did you parents talk about
 this person, H
itler? What did 
-- what did you know, what was your awareness? 

A: You know that since we went to
 -- still to German schools in 
the beginning, we took all these 
things in, and when all the young people were se
lected for the youth -- the Hitler yugen, and for 
the gymnast -- gymnastic classes and so on, no Jews
 were allowed to enter, nor half-Jews. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
33 
 
that was really the only thing that bothered me .Everything else, we copied, sort of. When they 
sang Germa n folk songs, and we went right along with it. 

Q: Did you feel that sense of 
Ger man nationalism then, that -- 
A: I -- I didn™t -- you know, they
 -- they said the  Polacks, th
e Polish people, and the French 
people, they are so dirty, they
 don™t wash thems e lves, they had 
all kinds of preconceived notions, 
or -- that was drilled 
into the German youth. And we stay
ing there, and being with them, 
believed the same  things.  

Q: And you felt very German?  

A: And we felt very German. After all, my fath
er was more German than the Germans, I would 
say. He -- he belonged to the Reichpont yudizhafr
ont soldaten. That means the ri -- the reich -- 
the club of the reich of the Jewi
sh s -- soldier of the front.  
Q: And so you, for a while you actually had non-Je
wish friends who were joining the Hitler 
youth, and you were wondering why -- 
A: Oh yes, all the time. 
Q: -- Jewish people weren™t allowed to -- 

A: Yes, yes. And then, after awh
ile, they -- their -- thei r parent s 
said, ﬁDon™t talk to this Jewish 
girl any mor e . Don™t -- don™t play with her. Stay 
away.ﬂ So we were really alone. We  were sort 

of es -- ostracized then, really. 

Q: And do you reme mbe r  hearing Hitler™s speeches at all? 

A: No. But my husband told me  he went, when he
 opened up the airport in Frankfurt, he went 
with his father to hear him, and that gave him th
e first time an idea that this man is a dictator. My 
husband was seven years older, and had much more
 knowledge, was very brilliant. And he told 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
34 
 
me this later, when we were married, naturall
y. He  said that he coul
d not understand it, that 
German people were so after him, spe -- especi
ally some  women that were enamored in him.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: -- morial Museum interview with Gisela Zamora. 
This is tape two, side B.  This is also a ma p 
here of Birkenau, and I think this
 is around the time  when you would 
have been there, it says late 
October -- 
A: Mm-hm, yes. 

Q: -- ™44. 

A: Yes. 

Q: When did -- when did you arrive?  
 You arrived in September, ™44? 
A: In ma  -- in September ™44, and was shipped out 
of Auschwitz in October, late October, to -- 
Q: To -- 
A: -- Mattsdorf [indecipherable] to wo
rk at Krumstar, Maidna and Franna. 
Q: Do you recognize where you would have been in the ma ps here? 

A: No, no, no, they were so close together, I c
ould never tell this. I -- I have absolutely no 
recollection. 

Q: But you were in Birkenau, you were in Auschwitz two, right? 

A: Yes. I -- I really didn™t know at
 that time  that it was Birkenau, 
but in the mornings we used to 
stand at the barbed wire, and we used to s
ee naked me n, and real musselmen go by, and waving 
and sought -- were -- were scr-screaming across 
the wire if they knew of this and this person, 
either  thei r wife, their 
mothers, or whatever.  
Q: They were on the outside, asking -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
35 
 
A: They were -- yes, they were in the me n™s -- in the me n™s camp. 
Q: So you were there for approxima tely four to five weeks? 

A: That™s right. 

Q: And dur -- 

A: Longer I wouldn™t have survived. 

Q: And during that time you said at one point you
 did become  aware of the crematorium, when 
was that? 

A: Yes, the girls, first of all -- the fi rst -- after 
the fi rst ni ght in Auschwit
z, we got out on appelle, 
to be s-standing in line and being counted. There was one girl mi ssing, 
and we saw her at the 
barbed wire , she had committed suicide. And there --  ther e was a big to-do in that ca mp, in our 

barrack, what happened, there™s 
one mi ssing. And then finally so
me body got up and said, ﬁShe is 
lying near the barbed wire.ﬂ  

Q: Wa s this a real shock to you? 
A: Yes, it was a shock, I saw it. I saw th
e woma n. A very good looking, Czech, Jewish, a 
younger woma n, maybe in her early 20™s.  
Q: And did you already have a se
nse that this was a very diffe
rent pl ace than Theresienstadt? 
A: Yes, yes. We  talked among ourselves that 
-- we  stood outside for hours, and I didn™t -- I was 
given one shirt, sort of, that we
nt down to my knees. It was a lit
tle flannel inside, thank God. No 
socks, no underwear, nothing. Some how or other,
 later on somehow, I got 
a -- a rag some wheres, 
and I used that around my -- my sp -- private par 
-- parts to be like an u
nderpair of -- under -- 
pair of pantyhose, or panties. 
I was always cold in Auschwitz, 
I cannot remember that I wasn™t 
cold, and suddenly I noticed that I 
-- my breathing started to be s
hort, and I realized I had fever, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
36 
 
and was coughing. Those were the first signs of 
having TB. I didn™t realize it, and my friend 
Ruth said, ﬁDon™t say anything, just st
ay and we™ll take care of you.ﬂ  
Q: So do you feel like at this stage you were st
arting to feel more de
pressed or hopeless about 
things, or -- or did you still somehow not re
alize what was possibly going to happen?  
A: We  all didn™t know what was going to happen 
to us, but we felt -- we -- we s melt a stench 
from the crematoria. By that time we knew that 
there was gassing going on. I me an, that was the 
-- the underground informed us. ﬁAnd if you don™t 
behave you™re going to go there too,ﬂ they 
said, ﬁso just do what they say.ﬂ And since I wa
s the smallest, or one of the smallest, I was 
always hidden by taller girl
s, and good looking girls. And 
some how I escaped, this way. 
Q: You think this helped you, to be small? 

A: It -- it helped me  at that mo me nt, yes. 

Q: We re you searching for your mo
t her, your father, your brother? 
A: I -- I would have liked, I wasn™t
 -- yes, I was trying to find out
 what happened to them, but we 
were so occupied in our own psyc
he, that it was just self-det er mi nation to stay alive, that we 
didn™t think about anybody else.  

Q: Did you help each other out, the -- the women you were with? 

A: Oh, I mu st say, these -- we 
-- the three girls that we were
 -- Hannah Laura Breaker, Ruth 
Wertheim and myself, we were like three si st ers. We  helped each other. 

Q: You shared food, and you -- 

A: Well, the -- the -- this comes later, when 
-- after we left Auschwitz, naturally we -- we 
couldn™t share foods, we each got our plate of 
soup, and a piece of bread, and everybody said, 
ﬁDon™t hide your bread, it™s going 
to be stolen, eat it as soon as
 you get it.ﬂ And that was the 
truth, because  some  of the girls, if they hid thei
r br ead for the night, or for whatever, they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
37 
 
gone. Some  of the other ma tes were so hungr
y, and at that time you were doing anything you 
could to get more food. Later on, when we 
were already deported to Mattsdorf and 
Reasonkeperga, which happened at dusk, really, it 
was almost dark in October, very dreary day, 
and maybe Mengele di dn™t see how small I was, a
nd said I wa s being selected to go out, because  
there was nobody among those girls that was as sm
all and perishable as I was. So e maciated, I 
would say already, and coughing. And that™s when I 
red -- I met Rose Hers
hkowitz with the half 
a loaf of bread. And we went out of Auschwitz 
that night, and arrive
d in Mattsdorf, it™s a 
krumstin ma idnon farflanna parachute factory. A
nd right away we were put in our bunks, and 
assigned to work for the next day. I was put on the 
machine that was absolutely one of the worst. 
You had to take raw flax, which came from th
e outside, the door was alwa ys open, and they 
threw that flax in and I had to lift it up and put it into the machine, to take off the seeds on the 

top. They had to be put in a certain
 way into the machine. [phone rings] 
Q: Okay. Okay, before we move on to talk about 
the labor camp, just a little bit more of a sense 
of what it was like day by day in Auschwitz. Di
d you ever do any work in Auschwitz, or every 
day you were just sort of fighting to -- to st
ay healthy?  You know, what was -- what was -- 
A: We were -- fi rst of all, I spent an awful lot of
 time  on the latrines, I had terrible diarrhea, and I 
took every mi nute I could to run to the latrin
e, which was not always allowed, and it had a 
permanent affect on my bowels, which I suffer 
today. We  -- we were asked by different older 
supervisors of our -- our kind in 
the barrack if we want to bri
ng the soup up. It was a steep little 
hill, and I volunteered a couple of
 times, but I found it very, ve ry hard to shlep ma ybe 20 liters or  
more of soup in the barrel. And I reme mber that 
as the worst labor for me in Auschwitz. I -- we 
didn™t do anything, we just stood 
at the appelle morning and night, cleaned the barracks if 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
38 
 
possible, if they let us, and waited for our meal . We were just the reserve for going out, and not 
employed in any way in Auschwitz itself. 

Q: We re you worried about being sent 
to the crematorium at that time? 
A: I don™t reme mber, I don™t think so. 

Q: And -- 

A: Some times one wished already th
at it™s -- it might be, but the 
self-preservation within one was 
so strong that you wanted to 
survive under any circumstances. 
Q: Did you think that your -- your family was still alive? 

A: I s -- I thought of it ti
ll the end of the war, and that™s why I went back to Friedberg. The 
Russian soldiers, and the Russian Jewi sh officer 
wanted me  to go with him to Russia. I said, 

ﬁNo, I have to go west.ﬂ 

Q: Did you ever -- later, did you ever receive any confirma tion of exactly how they died? 

A: Yes, when we wrote to Garovs
tein and we found out that this --
 the day when they arrived in 
Auschwitz, that™s their death da
y, that™s the [indecipherable] 
Q: And that was your mother and brother? 

A: Mother, and my father also, before. I have 
all the -- the docume nts about this. The funny thing 
is, my poor husband never could find
 out where his mother was, and we have a letter that they 
don™t know where she passed away. We think -- or he
 thought that she died in Litzma nnstadt, in 
Lódz, in the ghetto. 

Q: Did you -- the documentation that you have ab
out your family, did you ever send copies or 
any of that to the museum?  

A: I think they have it. I™m sure -- my hus
band did all of this, I 
am not aware of it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
39 
 
Q: Okay, so -- so now tell me  about -- tell me  a
bout the day that you were 
sent out of Auschwitz, 
and -- and the circumstances. What -- 
what exactly happened that day? 
A: We  were up -- we were rounded up, about 
800 - 900 young girls, Hungarians, German Jews, 
Polish Jews. The German Jews were a mi nority -- I was among those, and Czech. Our Czech 

brothers and si -- our Czech sister
s that were -- came from Theres
ienstadt with us, we assembled 
on the plaza, and then gi -- Mengele came  a
nd selected about four to 500 wome n. Among them 

was me . I had held the hand of my friend Ruth 
Wertheim, who probably pulled me  over, because 
I was so small, and sickly already. And he mi ght
 not have seen it, it was dusk, and gray and 
evening, and we were put on the train, on the last
 wagon again, a closed tr
ain, and were taken to 
Mattsdorf and Reasonkeperga. We  arrived there 
the next day, and were unloaded, and the thing 
was they didn™t have enough room for us, so 
they quickly built Quons
et huts on top of the 
factory, and that™s where we were located. That wa
s a -- an plus for us, because the heat rises up 
from the machinery that went on 24 hours a day in
 the factory, and we felt the first time a little 
warmth. And also, the factory had to
 get rid of dirty water that -- 
hot water that came  out of the 
machinery, since they were cooled by water, a
nd we washed ourselves, and we kept ourselves 
pretty clean during that time . But that was a time
 I got sick very fast, 
and a doctor came  and put 
me in the infirmary. I was coughing, I had a mastitis which was draini ng. My l-le -- ma -- in ma -

- on my ri-right breast for eight mont hs, even afte
r we were liberated yet. It gave me  terrible 
pain, and I had absolutely no incentive or will to
 live at  that  time any more. But my fr iend Ruth 
Wertheim, and Hannah Laura Breaker, both keptme  going. One day as we were standing there 

and talking in appelle, some how or other, theforema n of the factory came by, and he said, ﬁHow 

come  you gi rls speak so well German? ﬂ  So we said, ﬁWe -- we are Germans. We went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
40 
 
German schools.ﬂ He couldn™t under
stand it. So next da
y he brought us an a
pple, and we divided 
the apple in three. And that was the fi rst time 
that a German s howed some  kind of compassion. 
Q: Wa s he an SS? 
A: No, he was a worker, a -- a -- the forema n. No
t  -- not an SS. If the f -- SS would have known, 
probably he would have been fire
d, or whatever. But at that time, it was towards the end of the 
war, and they were very much wrapped up with th
e Russian front that was very close to us. We  
heard the shooting 
all night long. 
Q: Can you describe, approxima tely where -- 
where this labor camp was? You -- you were 
saying -- 

A: It was very near Gross-Rose
n, and right across from us was a 
labor camp of Frenc h prisoners 
of war. They actually wor-worked in our factory, 
too -- do -- to -- did some  heavy man™s labor. 

And some  girls even sort of befriended them
, or made some  kind of
 contact with them. 
Q: So in your factory it was 
only for wome n, is that right? 
A: That, yes, that part wa s only for wome n, whe r e 
-- where the flax was ma de into -- mi xed with 
a certain synt hetic ma terial for parachutes.  
Q: And you were telling me  be fore, when the ta
pe  ran out, the exact job that you were doing. 
A: Yes, I was -- as the raw flax, which -- which 
ma de sores on my hand because they are stalks, 
and you had to be fast putting it into the mach
ine. My hands were always bloody, and injured 

from this job. And the seeds went into a bucket 
used for some thing else, and the stalks w-were 
put through other machines, and refined to
wards cha -- changing it into a material. 
Q: And this was pretty hard --  
you know, difficult labor, would you say? 
A: It was very difficult labor. I 
was on one of the worst machines. My friend Ruth Wertheim was 
lucky, she wa s actually in a part of the sewing 
part, where they already mi xed the nylon, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
41 
 
whatever they had, some synthetic 
type of process, with the fl ax
 ma terial. And it was easier. So, 
actually, I wa s on the worst end of 
the labor. That™s why I got sick
 very fast. The -- the door was 
always open for the flax to be thrown in, wh
ich was also done by girls, and some  French 
prisoners brought the heavy bundles. And this we
nt for eight -- almost eight months, from 
October to May, 1945. We almost worked towards the 
very, very end of April in -- fully on these 
machines.  
Q: We re you hearing any 
news about the war?  
A: Yes, we heard that they were coming nearer, n
earer. The French soldiers warned us that they 
mi ght blow us up, so one morning all of a sudde
n, all the Germans were gone. They were -- the 
factory was locked up, all Quonset huts were 
locked up, and everything. We thought they are 
going to blow us up, but nothing happened, 
nobody was around, nuth -- nobody came. That went 

on for 24 hours, and we searched for food, and ther
e was really nothing left. And then finally we 
saw a Russian soldier come  on the bicycle, a
nd s-some body yelled out of a window, or whatever, 
and he came and alerted the Russian army. And t h
e first thing the girls di d -- I was too sick, 
slaughter a cow, or sa -- or a -- or some thing, or
 [indecipherable] just to get some  f -- real good 
food into us.  

Q: There was a cow nearby, you mean, or -- 

A: Oh, there were farms nearby. It was a very 
beautiful area. Oh, besi
des our regular job, ma ny 
times in mi ddle of the night, some  of us were 
taken, every time  a different c-cloud to shovel coal, 

to di -- ti -- when the coal wagons were brought i
n, we had to empty the m so they could be used 
right away. And I reme mber one night was te
rribly cold, snow on the ground, and we found 
some thing that looked so red, we took it, and wa
s a liver from some  kind of an animal, or 
whatever. And we took it into the barracks, and 
my friend Ruth put it on some  kind of a heating 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
42 
 
mechanism, maybe a radiator , or a machine that had 
heat, and sort of fried 
it a little, and the three 
of us divided it and ate it.  
Q: You were with a third fr iend as well ther e? 

A: That Hannah Laura Br eaker, three of us. 

Q: How was  -- you said there was one woma n in pa
rticular, she was a -- a German guard there? 
A: Yes, that -- that was in Auschwitz. There too, 
there wa -- there were tw
o Polish girls, and they 
claime d that they were lesbians. Polish Jewish 
girls that this German woman used them for 
sexual whatever, I don™t know
. And they were put in charge of us. And a fterwards we really got 
after the two. 

Q: The two in -- in Auschw
itz, or in the labor camp? 
A: In -- in -- in the labor camp, not in Auschw
itz. In Auschwitz I don™t se
e -- I have seen a non -- 
none except SS. 

Q: But in the labor camp, these two women -- 
A: [indecipherable] 
Q: The Polish Jewish wome n --  

A: -- Jewish wome n, yeah. 

Q: -- were in charge of your group. 

A: [indecipherable] group, yeah. A -- except in th
e morning that we stood outside, were counted 
by that SS woma n. 

Q: And she was very harsh? 

A: Very harsh. She right away came w
ith her what do you 
call, a riding -- 
Q: A whip? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
43 
 
A: Whip. And used to, if you didn™t stand strai 
-- straight, hit you over the shoulder, on your 
hands, or whatever. 
Q: So when -- when you were not feeling well, 
you were also given some  me dical attention 
while you were in the labor camp, right? 

A: Yes, that was after awhile. A ma n came, a Dr
. Hoffman, and apparently he was only a me dic, 
he was not a doctor, we found out after the war. We
 searched him. He actually helped a lot of the 
girls. Few girls that -- that came 
with us to the labor camp were pregnant, and had babies there, 
and mi scarriages. Maybe three or four, but I th
ink two survived and took their babies. And -- 
Q: They were able to keep th
eir babies there, at the camp? 
A: At the -- I don™t know, it was so late in the y
ear already. March, April, I mean how -- the g -- 
the Germans were afraid of everything alre
ady. They knew it was going towards the end, and 
they were so afraid of the 
Russians. And no mor e  trains, 
and no more gas chambers in 
Auschwitz, you know. Auschwitz was dism
antled in January. So they -- 
Q: Had -- had you heard about 
any of those developments? 
A: No, we didn™t know about this. We  didn™t know.
 But the French soldie
rs informed us a lot 
about. They -- they talked to some  of the girls.  

Q: Now wer e  you regularly having your 
me nstrual cycles, or were you so -- 
A: No-o, I had -- that is the funniest thing, my 
friend Ruth Wertheim had it a few times, and she 

had nothing to use, she used paper, or whatever
 she found, even flax. I had my me nstrual period 
once in Theresienstadt, and th
at was it. But one month after liberation, I had it again, and 
regularly till it stopped at age 52. 

Q: But for almost the entire time during the war? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
44 
 
A: I had none, none at all. I had -- I had ma ybe
 three, four me nstruations before we were 
deported, because I was about 
14 and a half, or whatever. 
Q: And you -- you did get fairly ill by the end, it seems. 
A: I was very ill. As a ma tter of fact, it took me
 many -- I woul d say a year or two to recover. 
And how I ever got to Friedberg -- 
I walked, with French prisoners of war, with Germans, on this 
general exodus from the east to
wards Germany, and I had my yello
w stripe on a jacket, and we 
looted some  things in German houses, so I had 
enough cl-clothes to wear. And I went e -- west. 
And it was a beautiful June, I reme mber. Oh, firs
t there was one month -- I™m sorry, I was taken 
to a -- to a German hospital that was taken over by
 the Russians, and I stayed there four weeks, 
and they sort of healed m -- healed me , they
 helped me  to get much better and stronger. 
Q: We ll now, when liberation occurred.-- 

A: Everybody left, but the ones that were
 in the  sick brai -- sick --  
Q: Sick bay? 
A: Bay. Couldn™t go. So I was -- 
Q: How ma ny were there? 

A: Oh, there were about, I would say, 
25 to 30 girls. And the ones that -- 
Q: So you were already there for -- how long be
fore liberation were you in the sick bay? 
A: I would say two or three months. 

Q: And you were not working during that time? 

A: No, I couldn™t. 

Q: And you had tuberculosis?  What did you have at the time? 

A: I™ve had tuberculosis, and the ma s
titis. And I had a fever all the time.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
45 
 
Q: So when liberation took place, ji -- and you were
 still so unwell health-wise, did you feel free 
and happy?  Wha -- 
A: I was so happy, and so elated that we were fr
ee, we could do now wha t ever we wanted to, and 
it was -- this feeling, I wished I 
could get back. This was nirvana. 
Q: So you really understood this was the end of the 
war, this was it. It had really happened, and 
you were -- 

A: It had happened. But then I realized I was alon
e in this world, and luckily when I arrived at 
Friedberg, I got a ride with a -- 
an American, with two American 
soldiers as soon as I came to 
Holf and Saxon, they gave me  a ride to Birkenback
 in Germany, and from there some trains were 
leaving, going towards Frankfurt, 
and I took a train to Hanau, which 
was very close to Friedberg, 
because the train from Frankfurt di
d not go to Friedberg  yet. So 
from Ha nau I took the train to -- 
where I got the money from, I don™t reme mber, but 
everything was on the -- on the road. I got to 
Friedberg, and I wa -- a-asked the stationmaste
r, ﬁDo you know if Mr. Mowra, Edgar Mowra is 
here, and where does he live?ﬂ And he said, ﬁHe 
just came  back from Dachau.ﬂ He was in 
Dachau, and he told me  where he was. And that™s where I ended up, and stayed with him, his 

son, and the housekeeper till my papers came through. 
Actually not the whole time . He  felt that I 
should be taken care of with my tuberculosis, an
d took me  to the hospital in Bad Nauheim. And a  
very fine German radiologist said, ﬁWell, she has pr
etty bad tuberculosis on the left side of -- the 
left lung. And we should give he
r pneumothorax.ﬂ So I s --

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
A: They don™t do it any more
 today, it™s very dangerous. 
Q: This is a United Stat es Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview with Gisela Zamora, 
conducted by Amy Rubi n, on June first, 2003. This is 
tape number three, side A. Since we were 
just cut off then, tell me  again -- if you w
ould also, just ma ke sure I understand the chronology 
from the labor camp, and where you went next, a
nd then of course, tell me  about the me dical 
procedure that you had. 
A: I had a medical procedure in the labor 
camp, by the way. This Dr. Hoffman, or medic 
Hoffman that arrived there, who came from Bar
dkissingin, which we late
ler -- we later found out 
he was a me dic with the German ar my corps. He 
ma de two incisions in my cyst, or whatever it 
was in my right breast, and the pus finally came  
out, and he entered a canula and this drained for 
eight months. But he did a pretty good job, and 
even though he was just a me dic, not a me dical 
physician, it helped me  to survive through th
e other months. However, I continued coughing, 
suffered very much from shortness of breath, 
and know that I have had some thing -- I have 
some thing with my lungs. And when I finally arri
ved in Friedberg, and stayed at Edgar Mowra™s, 
I was very grateful that he took me  to the hospi
tal in Bad Nauheim, which is known as one of the 
top heart spas in the world, and had an excellent
, at that  time, staff in it™s hospitals. A woman 
physician, a radiologist, was very 
kind to me , and explained everything, and said, ﬁYou need a 
pneumothorax for eight -- for as long as we can 
do it. We  collapse your left lung so it can rest.ﬂ 
And they pump air into the cavity, but very shor
tly already, water filled
 up -- fluid, after the 
cavity was empty, and that™s the da
nger of this procedure. And 
actually it does not help very 
much. After awhile they decided to refrain 
from t hat, and my lung seemed to ex -- 
Q: Expand? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
47 
 
A: Expand again to almo st norma l size, but my 
pleural covering was completely disintegrated, 
which I did not find out till I arri
ved in the United States, and 
had a triple bypass at Columbia 
Presbyterian Hospital. And due to this finding, 
I finally got, a month la
ter, operation from the 
German government for gesundheit sharden. 

Q: You got -- I™m sorry, he
re in the s -- Stat es -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- you got compensation, you mean? 

A: Yes, finally when -- when Columbia -- wh
en the physician from Columbia gave me  the 
operative report, and I send it to the German au
thorities. I had gotten the compensation for time 
in camp, and for labor, but nothing monthly. And I 
am grateful now that I get this monthly 
compensation, because I am alone. My Social Secur
ity is very small. I have some resources, and 
own my apa r tment, but as I get older, I™m
 alone, I have to think about the future. 
Q: And that™s because of the me dical -- 
A: Yes, the comp --  
Q: -- issues. 

A: Yes, the compensation is purely for me dical reasons. 

Q: So -- so after -- after libe
ration, and -- well, what
 -- tell me  what happened to your close 
friends you were with at that time. 

A: Oh, this is very interesti
ng, too. I -- I -- my friend Hannah La
ura Breaker was living pretty far 
away from Friedberg, where I was, and she decide
d -- and call -- t-told me 
that she will not stay 
in Germany, she does not want really to go to Am
erica, but she mi ght go to America in order to 
get to Israel. She went to the U.S. -- she ca -- w
ith one of the first refug
ee transports in 1946, at 
the end of ™46, and stayed with her relatives 
in Wa shington He ights in New York, and then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
48 
 
decided to join an aliyah. And one year later went
 to Israel to live ther e.
 She lived in Moetine, 
and I visited her the first time when I got to
 Israel in 1963. She wa -- had married, and had 
children, was a heavy smoker, and a -- gained it 
-- lot of weight, and when my husba nd and I 
returned in 1973, we looked up again where she 
was living, and she had passed away. My friend 
Ruth Wertheim I kept in touch all along in this
 country. We were like sisters. We called each 
other almost weekly. She understood more of 
the horrible time s we went through, and she had 
lost a si ster before she got to Theresiensta
dt, because she was -- she gave [indecipherable] 
Q: She was attacked, 
or lynched, or -- 
A: No, no, she hit into the -- in
 the face of a -- of a Nazi boy 
who called her some thing, and she 
was right away taken, and they hanged her. And th
is left  a terri ble scar 
on my friend Ruth during 
all this time. She ma rried this lawyer, who wa
s very good to her, had two children, a boy and a 
girl. Her son is now president of -- he was at M.
I.T., a provost. He is now
 the president of the -- 
what is the Jewish university -- 
Q: A school -- Brandeis? 
A: Brandei -- not Brandeis, another one there, very
 fa mous college in Bost
on, he is the president. 
Q: But it™s Jewish, or not? 

A: More or less -- not -- I for
got. I™m sorry. Maybe it™s Brandeis
. No, I don™t think so. My friend 
Ruth Hershkowitz knows, I™ll ca -- ask her, and 
call her, and let you know, if you want to know. 
Q: And -- and your friend Ruth also came to the U.S.? 

A: Yes, that was -- and she had ma ny good years,
 she had a good life in 
Pontiac. I visited her 
there twice. And we were like si
sters, and she had the quadruple 
or quintuple bypass in Boston at 
Brigham Hospital, and unfortunately
 it didn™t help her, she passe
d away two years later. I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
49 
 
more lucky, I had only a triple bypass. Dr. Eric
 Rose, who does now only heart transplants did 
mi ne, and did a good job. 
Q: When you were back in -- in Frie
dberg, did you also look for your fami ly? 
A: Yes, that™s why I went back, and we™d s
earched. Edgar Mowra helped me  very mu ch to 
search, he went to the authorities. At that tim
e Ge rmany was i n chaos. A lot of soldiers had 
vanished, even, in Russia, and po -- in Poland and 
-- and so on, they -- they were -- the German 
people were interested in thei
r own fi rst. But the America
n, and the Britis
h authorities 
[indecipherable]on the west, established regist
ration, camps, a nd eventually I ended up in 
Feldafing, which was a -- in Barbaria, which wa
s a refugee camp, but it 
had a TB hospital. And 
they send me  to Bardkolegrup for re-rehabilitat
ion, and for the air, which was in the Al ps. 
Q: And whe n was this? 

A: In 1946 - ™47. 

Q: After Bad Nau -- Nauheim?  
A: Nauheim, yes, after b -- after I stayed with 
the Mowras for a little wh
ile, with Mr. Mowra. 
Q: So you looked for your fa mily, and couldn™t find any trace of them?  
A: No, no, and I didn™t know -- we
ll, I -- I f -- I surmised they 
were killed in Auschwitz.  
Q: And how did you feel -- 

A: How wa -- how did I feel -- 

Q: N-No, I was going to ask you how you felt be
ing back in Germany, a nd after the war. 
A: You know, it™s a funny thing, is that I felt happy 
to be so liberal-lated, th
at I was able to -- to 
partake in everything. And it never crossed my
 mind what the Germans di d to us, really. 
Ignorance. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
50 
 
Q: You think you just we ren™t thinking of it in 
that sense? I mean, you knew that the Germans 
were responsible for the war -- 
A: Yes, definitely. 

Q: -- starting the war. 

A: As time went on, and as I talked to American 
soldiers, and my uncle here in America, Louie 

Marx, my mother™s brother, ma de sure that I co
me  as soon as possible. He put everything into 
motion, and he asked my  relatives here in Scarsd
ale, who were bor -- 
she was a born Lanksdorf, 
and a distant relative to my grandmother on my mo
ther™s side, to help, 
and they did, and brought 
me  over in 1947. 

Q: And that was also through the Offbau newspaper? 

A: Yes, oh yes, they -- an American soldier,
 unfortunately I don™t reme mber his name , and I 
never kept a record of it, he published an announcem
ent in the Offbau to say that Gisela Eckstain 
is looking for relatives, and a friend from Ba
ttenberg read it, and cal
led my uncle, she knew 
where he was in Wa shington Heights, and told 
hi m, ﬁYour niece is looking for you.ﬂ And that™s 

how I got in contact. And I lived
 with them for a little while. But unfortunately my uncle had a 
horrible wife. She was a witch.  

Q: And the -- 

A: But he was such a good ma n. 

Q: And at the time you actually felt you would have 
preferred to have stayed in Germany, is that 
right? 

A: You know, I was so attached to the Mowr
a family, they were so good to me . And t he 
housfrau -- the -- the -- the housekeeper is one of 
my most -- the person that gave me the most 
soul input. I have to show you a picture, it
™s on the wall there, of
 all my favorites.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
51 
 
Q: And wha t ™s her name? 
A: Her name was Meeta Oyla. She was a bastard gi
rl apparently, and she kept the household for 
the Mowras.  

Q: And you didn™t feel anti-Semitism after the war in Germany? 

A: No, but I think they didn™t like th
at there were comi ng so ma ny refuge es. 
Q: How did you -- there was also, 
I think, a document you sent to the mu seum, some t hing from a 

Russian sergeant allowing you to go from one zone to the next. 

A: Yes, I am going to show you the original. 

Q: The mus e um have a copy of this?  Do you know? 

A: They have the copy. 

Q: Okay. 

A: This is the original, prayer
bushka, ma de out by a Russian o
fficer, and he was wonderful to 
me , because I didn™t understand any Russian, and he 
talked Yiddish to me, or German a little bit, 
and he helped me so much when I was in th
is lotsarett it was ca
lled, in Mattsdorf and 
Reasonkeperga. 

Q: And wha t  does it say, or what do you 
-- what -- what did it help you to do? 

A: That™s my husband. Jewish muse um in Frankfur
t. That has a wonderful Jewish museum. The y 
were trying to find his mother, they never found 
her. Elinore Za moira. They changed the name  
from Za mor a to Zamoira -- ets -- so -- from Za mo ir
a to -- to Za mora in Italy. They were in Italy. 
Q: So tell me  about this document, when did y -- how did you -- 

A: This document helped me to get fr om the Polis
h -- through the Polish z
one, to the -- it was the 
Russian zone , and then into the American zone. It 
was quite a -- a big deal to get from one to the 
other, but some how or other, I kept this. I al
so had a document from Krumstar, Maidna and Fron, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
52 
 
and I think they have that too at the museum,but I don™t have -- I can™t find the copy. However, 
the German gir -- governme nt acknowledged that I 
worked there, and that I got my c o mpensation 
for that.  

Q: So -- 

A: Oh I™d -- I just found this, my husband had so
 much -- oh, I -- I put my  -- my parents and his 
parents in -- on the Miami Holocaust Museum -- 

Q: Memorial? 

A: Memorial. Have you seen that? 

Q: No, not in Miami. 

A: It™s beautiful, really beautiful. 

Q: So from my understanding, after 
the war, you were first in a hos
pital for about five weeks in -
- in the same area -- 

A: Bad Nauheim. 
Q: But -- but -- but before
 that, were you still -- 
A: Oh, I was in a Russian -- I -- I mean a German 
lotsar ett, which is like a -- a fi el d hospital for 
soldiers, which the Russians took ove
r after they liberate
d this area, and ma de
 it into a Russian 
hospital, and took in some  refugees that were 
sick, and I stayed there for approxima tely six 
weeks. And the food I reme mber very well, wa
s every day a herring, which was so salty, and 
grits, or something like a cereal. They didn™
t have much themselves. And black bread. 
Q: Is that where you me t the Russian sergeant who gave you this document? 

A: Yes. I -- I talked to all the Russian soldiers 
there, and some  of them were Jewish. They were 
very interested in our stories. 

Q: And had you grown up speaki
ng Yiddish, did you know Yiddish? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
53 
 
A: I learned a little Yiddish in Theresienstadt, 
but not really -- they 
-- they understood German 
some what. 
Q: And did you grow up learning Hebrew? 

A: No, not really. My husband did. He was a spec
ialist in languages. As a ma tter of fac t , he 
translated a book from He
brew into English. 
Q: So after -- after that is when you walked. Y
ou walked, and then you took a train in the end of 
your journey. 

A: A train, yes, after I got th
is lift from Saxony, approxima tel
y, there were no trains going 
whatsoever, no transportation. And then finally 
some body hold it for me , and gave me  a lift. And 
nobody was afraid at that time of hijacking, a
nd so on, so forth. They deposited me  at the 
railroad station in Words port, not We rdham 
-- We rdham -- Wordsport, 
not We rdham back. And 
I found my way back to Friedberg. 

Q: How long were you on this walking 
journey, were you with other people? 
A: Two ow -- two weeks, 
with other people, we slept in hay lo
fts, we slept with farmers, and I 
even was enamored in a German sol dier that walked
 with us. Just -- it was such a liberating idea, 
and everything. I didn™t think wh
at they did to us really. 
Q: Did you have any feelings of rese
ntme nt toward anybody at that time? 
A: No resentment. I still must say I don™t want to 
sis --  resentment to c-come into my heart. I 
have contact with some  very fine Germans that
 could have been probably more helpful, but I 
don™t know if -- what we would have done in th
e circumstances. Their lives were put on the 
edge, too, when it came  to help Jews.  

Q: So what is your feeling about 
this idea of forgiveness, or do 
you think about it in that way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0476  
54 
 
A: We ll, today™s world is so full of turmoil, 
and hate between various peoples. And I hope that 
Israel  and the Palestinians will come to some ki
nd of accord, that would be  a blessi ng for all the 
Jews. But the Jews have to give also, they canno
t just take all the time. And we must learn a 
lesson, that there are ways to find one™s own salva
tion, and can still be active in the Jewish faith. 
I™m reading a letter f -- about Judaism now, very -- 
pretty much at the end 
of my life, I want to 
return to my  original upbringing, 
and so on. But I have reservati
ons. When I think about all the 
ceremonies that we have, and circumcisions, 
and these feasts. They
 are two, 3000 years old. 
They don™t have to be replicated in
 the way we are replicating them. 
Q: And you have shown an interest in
 studying other religions, as well. 
A: Yes, I would say monotheism is not the an
swer, it™s monism. One 
self above all. And 
everybody has some  of t hat self, and ma ybe it™s th
e same  as God. And monotheism is not so far 

away from monis m. I have learned a lot from 
Ratunda, I had a wonderful, wonderful teacher. A 
swa mi that was here for several years is teachin
g now in Chile. And what I learned through my 
husband -- I myself would na -- would 
not have come to this, is -- is 
not to be -- it -- it™s gold to 
me. It™s mor e than gold, it™s an 
inner richness that I received. 
Q: Do you consider yourself to ha
ve a religion in the way that 
people label religion these days? 
A: No, definitely not. I -- I™m a free thinker, and 
as I said, I had some  -- I have some  friends at 
the Quakers, I have attended some of their sittin
gs, just for meditation, and they are ve ry good to 
me. I don™t know if my fa mily here 
in Scarsdale ap -- appreciates it.
 They are very mu ch into the 
Refor m Judaism, which is very good. I go with them at the Jewish holidays for service there. But 

it™s too much ma terialism a mongst we Jews. And th
ey have to do much more self searching, and 
giving. With that I want to end. 

Q: What™s that?

A: With that I want to end. 
Q: Oh, you want to end. 

A: And I still have anot -- 

Q: One thing I™m wonde ring about is when it wasthat you finally felt he
althy again, after the 

war, and after being in the hospi
tal, a couple different places.When were you feeling healthy? 
A: I would say a hundred percent healthy I did no
t f-feel ever. I ge -- always had a tiredness 
about myself. Wa sn™t very able to do a lot of 
things, and very soon exhausted. But once I me t my 
husband, who was a mountain climber, a hiker -- I wa
s also a hiker before that, I must say I have 
walked, I love to walk. He changed my w
hole outlook, and introduced me  to the eastern 
philosophies, and I learned yoga, I taught it about
 eight years here in 
Greenburg, in the adult 
education center, and also at th
e high school, at -- at the co 
-- co-op in the Bronx, Truman High 
School for adult education, and also for teenager
s towards the end. And I also taught yoga here 
and there when I was asked by some  organizatio
n, or ma ke a demonstration. When the Madison 
Square Garden was still in existence, I had a 
headstand on the stage of 
Madison Square Garden. 
Not alone, with two other students of the swa mi at that time . 

Q: And how do you see your experiences, what
 you went through during the war, having 

affected your -- your own interest
 in religion?  Do you think it™
s directly connected what you 
went through, and then sort of this
 exploration that
 you™ve been on? 
A: I-I think that is a question of development. I 
was very much impressed first with sc ience. But 
science also does not give all the answers. And 
I was in the medical fi el
d, in laboratories, doing 
research, especially in huma n blood, and sera, and 
so on, and so forth. And r
outine analysis of all 
fluids. My husband also was a chemist, and we 
discussed a lot of s-sciences, and so on and so 
forth. It left me  with some  que
stions and doubt, and it was some times quasi quasi, there were not

hundred percent answers to anyt
hing. When my  husband branch
ed out into philosophy and 
religion, I got a whiff of it, and he passed it on 
to me , and he would be proud today if he would 
be alive to see me  pursue it so vigorously. 
Q: Do you feel in other ways that
 -- that what you experienced dur
ing the war really stayed with 
you throughout the years after?  Are 
there certain things that --  
A: That humans can be ve ry crue l to each other, 
and we talk about heart, and love, and so on and 
so forth, but the -- the principle of
 self preservation is 
so strong, that any huma n being resorts to 
any criminal action, even killi
ng another human being, ma ybe a -- even a sibling for his self 
preservation. So this all has to be worked out
 by me n. And I think I got wi ser by having had this 

experience, and I wonder what the other side will
 bring, if there is another side, and so more 
learning, and more experiencing. We don™t know. I 
have my doubts, like everybody else, and to 
erase doubt is the hardest thing of any journey, 
I think. If you don™t have any more doubts, then 
you are a saint. 
Q: Did you -- I -- I felt that you had told me  ove
r the phone that perhaps 
one -- one way that the 
experiences during the Holocaust  stay
ed with you is that you decided 
not to have children, is that 
-- is that  right? 
A: That was my husband™s decision, more or less
. And then I had this toxic pregnancy, or 
whatever it was, it was never found out. But I had 
a very bad case of hepatitis, and wa s sick for 

seven weeks in Presbyterian Hospital in New Yo
rk. So after that, my gynecologist, who was Dr. 
Gisela Pearl said, ﬁIf you don™t wa
nt children, just don™t have them
.ﬂ And the sex life was not the 
most important thing for me . Maybe when 
I was younger, yes, but not at that time . 
Q: But it wasn™t as much an active decision 
not to bring children into the world, as -- 
A: No, it was not an act of precision,
 but my hus band took precaution alwa ys.

Q: He -- he felt he did not want children. 
A: He didn™t -- he didn™t 
want. He had a strong fee
lings that the suffering on this planet is very -- 
he said planet earth is one of the mo st insignifica
nt planets in this univers
e. And he learned that 
from Gerchiev, the Russian philosopher mystic. 
And he dabbled into that, and why perpetuate 
this race, and we really don™t know if we ever
 will know. The real, final answer is -- every 
scientist is groping for it, every f -- philosopher, a
nd ever -- every religious 
thing are -- is grabbi 
-- grabbing with it, and have
 their opinions, and --

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum interview with Gisela 
Zamora. Thi s  is tape three, side B. Do 
you -- do you have any regular flashbacks to what 
happened during the war, is that some thi
ng that come s to you in your daily life? 
A: No, I mu st say, very little. 
Very little. It sort of vanish
ed. It™s not preoccupying my mi nd. 
Unfortunately, my physical body gives me  a lot of 
problems on. I dwell on that too mu ch. If I 
could get over that, and re-realize that a body is 
just the case of -- or the temple of our  real 
existence, if we -- if I could bri
ng that to a real unde
rstanding, and strong idea, I would be better 
off. But I have only si -- grace, I think was given 
to me , to survive, and to -- to learn, and to 
reach this country, and learn, and I™m still learni ng.  

Q: And did you have -- do you reme mber having 
any dreams or night ma res during the war, 

anything that came to you on a regul
ar, recurring basis back then? 
A: I don™t reme mber. It™s too bad. But I must sa
y occasionally now when I™m -- I am al one, and I 
have had periods of depression and anxiety, once 
or twice I have had bad dreams whe r e I jumped 
out of bed, and the dream is just -- flies away, 
and I can™t reme mber. But these are not very ni ce

experiences. I don™t know if they have to do with the war, because I don™t reme mber  too much 
about it. 

Q: And wha t  about your parent
s and brother, do you -- do you tr
y to not think about them, do 
you try to think of them?  

A: I don™t think of them very 
much, unfortunately, I should. My 
brother™s birthday is comi ng up, 
would -- he would be now two years younger than I 
am. So I think about him because he was so 
young taken away, and he suffered so much more 
by having had typhus in Theresienstadt, and -- 
and right away to the gas chambers, it™s very, very sad. And I see him some ti me s in the attic 

where we lived in Battenberg with me , and that
 night when Crystal Night took place. How we 
two huddled together. We were i
nnocent, young. Didn™t know anything.  
Q: We ll, one thing I just wanted to ask. When we 
started the interview I actually forgot to make 
sure that you stated the date, and the y
ear you were born. So, if you wouldn™t mi nd just 

repeating, saying your name , and where you 
were born, and the date you we re born. 
A: I was born on the fifth of February, 1928, by a 
mi dwife helping my mother, in Battenberg on 
the Aida in Germany. 

Q: And finally, is there anything 
else you would like to add that 
ma ybe I forgot to ask, that you 
would like to say during this interview? 

A: No, I think I talked already too mu ch. I gave
 a lot of myself, and my hus band always warned 
me , he said, ﬁKeef -- kit -- keep it for yourself, ke
ep it inside, it helps you 
to develop.ﬂ So ma ybe 
I ma de a mi stake to open myself. 

Q: I hope not, and I don™t think so. I think -- I th
ink it -- I think it™s also
 good to help others 
understand what you experienced. I think 
that™s part of sharing, and -- 
A: Thank you, thank you very much.
