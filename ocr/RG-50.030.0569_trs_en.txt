Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Rita Penn
, on March 2
nd
, 2010, conducted by
 Ina Navaze lskis
, held at 
Leisure 
World 
in
 Silver Spring, Maryland.
 Thank you 
Rita
, for coming to speak with us. 
I™d like to start this intervie
w like we do almo st all of ours, at the very beginning. 
Answer: Okay. 
Q: And that is information about your bi
rth, who were your parents, where were 
you born, did you have sibli
ngs, wh at did your fami ly do? Provide us a context for 
the story. 
A: Okay. Well, I was 
born March 29, 1933, in
 Vienna, Austria
. My parents are 
Simon Œ 
well, he used to spell it, 
s-z-y-m-o-n,
 but now, later it became anglicized, 
and it was 
s-i-m-o-n
 
Knoll, k-n-o-l-l.
 And my mother, her maiden name was 
Appel, a-p-p-e-l
, and I have no siblings, I was 
an only child. We lived in an 
apartment house in a two part apartment,
 and my  Œ my  father™s brother and his 
family, they had two children, 
their Œ they did not stay in 
Europe
 either. And we 
lived in the Œ the same 
building. So me years ago, I took my  family to 
Vienna
, and I 
knew the address, so I went to look at th
e building. And there was a plaque there 
that said this is not the or
iginal building. The original 
was destroyed in the war Œ in 
the World War II and I th
ought, good for them.

Q: Was your family originally from 
Vienna
, were they Austrian Jews, or were they 
from Œ 
s-z-y-m-o-n
 suggests 
Poland. 
A: Yeah, yes, yes. Both my parents were born in
 Poland.
 They came to 
Vienna
 as 
young adults, and I don™t know exactly wh en
 that was, and they married. My father 
had six brothers and three si
sters, large family . And the 
family was in Œ they had a 
busin ess that had to do with sewing mach
ines, and they did something with cloth 
for sacks and things. But the whole family 
worked there, the si
sters worked in the 
office, the three sisters. 
Q: This was in
 Pola nd
? 
A: No, th is was in
 Vienna
. 
Q: Was in
 Vienna,
 I see, okay. 
A: Yeah. So they all 
worked there togethe
r. So, they Œ and I kn
ew Œ well, some of 
them I knew later, because many Œ several 
of them escap ed, a couple of them 
didn™t. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So, I had Œ I Œ I still have one cousin 
who lived in the same
 apartment with us, 
she lives in 
New York; 
I don™t see her very often. He
r brother, who I was a little 
closer to, he died a few years ago. He wa
s a journalist, and he 
actually worked for 
ﬁ
The Washington Post,ﬂ
 for awhile. 
Q: What was his name ? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569

A: 
Irwin Knoll. 
He worked for the 
Post
 and then he went out to 
Ma dison, 
Wisconsin
 to edit ﬁ
The Progressi ve
.ﬂ He was very liberal
. Good guy, but didn™t 
take very good care of himself. H is widow still lives in 
D.C.
 now. 
Q: I see. A nd there Œ a
nd he then also escaped. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What are your earliest memo ries that 
you can remember of Œ 
of your home, your 
household, your Œ of 
Vienna
, of your ch ildhood, while
 you were still there? 
A: Mm-hm. Well, I was six when
 I left, so it™s not very, ve
ry clear. In fact, when we 
went back with the family
, I walked around trying to  think if anything lo oked  
familiar. At the time w e were there, they 
were building a subway , so the whole city 
was sort of torn up, and so Œ 
Q: What year was this? 
A: That we went back? 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It must have 
been in the 70s. 
Q: I see. So it™s a good 30 years ago. 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Okay . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
6
 
 
A: Yeah, with my  husband and two children 
we went there before they went off. 
You know, they™re adults now, wi
th their own children, so Œ 
Q: And do you Œ do y
ou remember then, aba Œ about th
ose first six years? Do you 
have any sense of 
Vienna
? 
A: I have vague memories, mainly of my
 fami ly and my  cousin , th-the one who 
died, who lived in th e build ing with me, 
beating me up. That I remember very 
clearly.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: And I remember we had a fairly larg
e extended family and we used to get 
together at Œ I think it was my  grandmothe
r™s house. But I don™t have very clear 
memo ries of as Œ you know, a six year ol
d is not really too sh arp. I do rememb er 
when  we left 
Vienna
. I remember it was kind of un
comfortable. My mo ther Œ we 
were not allowed to bring any jewelry with 
us or anything. And I re Œ I rememb er I 
had a necklace, a very thin little necklace, and I rememb er my mother sewed the 

necklace into the elastic of 
my underpants. And my father had left a little before us, 

because it was really very bad for men.
 And so my mother and I left, and I 
reme mb er going on the Œ the boat from 
Calais
 to Œ 
Q: Do you rememb
er the trip from 
Vienna
 to
 Calais
? 
A: No.  
Q: No? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
7
 
 
A: Well, I thi Œ I remember being on the tr
ain, but not very clearly, you know? And 
then I remember on the boat over to 
Calais
. And then we were in 
England
 and we 
lived in 
Londo n
. We were there during a lot of the blitz. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: I remember wonderful times w e ha
d going to sleep in
 the subway, the 
underground, as they call it. 
Q: Yeah. What part of 
Lo ndo n
, do you know? 
A: We were in Œ 
jeez
, I don™t remember exactly where it was. 
Kilburn, 
I think 
[indecipherable]
 section. 
Q: I think that™s in west la Œ western part of the city? 
A: I™m not sure. 

Q: Okay . 

A: I Œ I™ve been back
 several times to 
Lo ndon
, but I don™t re Œ 
Q: Not east 
London.
 Not Œ not south
 Lo ndo n. 
A: I don™t think so. 

Q: Yeah, I think 
Kilburn
 is west, if I rememb er it. 
A: Yeah, yeah. We were there for awhile. 
The Œ there was a Œ a 
Jewi sh agency that 
Œ that helped  at the beginning.  

Q: So you weren™t on a 
Kindertransport
? 
A: No, no, no, no. 

Q: Okay . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569

A: I was with my mother the whol
e time. My father went to the 
Isle of Man. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: He was interned for 11 months, beca use the British were very nervous about 
people wh o spoke German. And of course
, we spoke German then. So he was 
interned there. Also, my mother had a si
ster who had married a German, who tried 
to follow Œ who did follow her to 
England
. And then  he was sent on a transport to
 
Canada
 and it was torpedoed, and he went down . And th at was Œ she never 
remarried or anything. My fa
ther was there for 11 months. He had a great time. He 
became a cook, which he ne
ver did before or since.
 And in Œ it wasn™t Œ 
Q: He wasn™t mistreated? 

A: No, oh no, no. He Œ he s
eemed to, you know, get along 
with all the people there, 
and when he was released, he cam
e and joined us. By this time Œ 
Q: Do you remember 
not having him around? 
A: Yes. My mother was only able to work 
as a domestic. That was the only job that 
was available for the immigrants. And I reme
mber we went to Œ 
she worked in what 
was called a Œ a boys™ college, it was like priv
ate school, with kids living there. And 
I got the measles. And so they shipped me
 off to the hospital very fast, before I 
spread it through the entire Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ school population. And that was my  Œ 
just my mother and I 
were there at that 
time. And then my Œ the sc
hool that I went to in
 Eng land
, and I don™t really have a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
9
 
 
clear picture of that school in 
Londo n
, decided to ev acuate everybody out to th e 
country. So they sent us out to 
Gloucestershire
, and we lived in a little town Œ a 
little villag e outside of 
Cheltenham, 
and we were boarded with
 a family there. And 
I Œ I have very clear pictures of that. I we
nt to school there, they had a Œ a regular 
school in a neighborhood. 
And I Œ I do rememb er one day the principal I guess it 
was, called me into the office and said, 
you Œ you unde
rstand German? I said, well, 
I don™t speak it much any more, because 
by th en you Œ you didn™t speak German. 

Q: That was going to be Œ that was going to
 be one of my  questions, is how was that 
transition for Œ for a young 
ch ild ? T h ey  Œ  th ey  so ak  
up languages like sponges. 
A: Right, right. 

Q: So, I could imagine Œ 

A: I was teaching my  parents. My pare
nts had been taking English lessons, you 
know, with Œ with records and stuff. And th
ey Œ they died with an accent, okay? I 
picked it up immediately. And the princi
pal said to me, you sp eak German? I Œ 
well, I understand German, cause I didn
™t want to speak it any more. And 

apparently , there was a prisoner of war camp nearby, and they wanted to bring th ese 
prisoners over to talk to me, the Germans. And I Œ 
Q: And you were how old? 

A: Œ refused to talk to Œ 
Q: You must have been a little girl. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
10
 
 
A: I mu st have been about eight or nine at the time. And I said no, I won™t talk to 
them. And I wouldn™t. I would not talk Œ I wo
uldn't  meet with them, I wouldn™t talk 
to them. 

Q: So tell me though, as an eight or nine 
year old child, to have su ch Œ such  a very 
strong, marked position, how ha
d things been explained to 
you by your parents, of 
what was going on, and why you™d left 
Vienna
, and Œ and th is wa
r, and so on. Ti Œ 
can you recall that? 

A: Not really. I don™t remember ever actu
ally discussing it with
 them. It was just 
sort of a fact of life that you left 
Vienna
. You didn™t Œ you Œ y
ou couldn™t stay there 
any more, because there were these guys ma
rching around with the brown unifo rms, 
and the boots, and Œ and these were not 
good guys, and the sooner we got out of 
there, the better. So, off we went to
 England
, and I became an English child fast. I 
Œ I was Œ as I said, I was teaching my pare
nts English because I Œ I picked it up, you 
know, very quickly . 
Q: So, in  other word s, was it an English ch ild saying to th e principal that no, I don™t 

want to talk to the German prisoner
s of war, because they ™re the enemy of 
England
 
and we™ve just survived 
the blitz, or was it a Œ 
A: No, I just said I don™t want to talk to them. 

Q: And that™s it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
11
 
 
A: And that was the end of it, yeah. A
nd I didn™t. I never met them, and I Œ I 
wouldn™t speak with them, so I Œ I don™t know  why they wanted to talk to me in the 
first place. 
Q: I also find it very surprising that a prin
cipal would ask an eight year old child to 
meet with prisoners of war. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: I find it Œ 
A: It was Œ I don™t know, maybe Œ I 
don™t know, maybe they were being 
rehabilitated or something, I don™t know, I 
really don™t know, but it was kind of a 
strange episode. 

Q: But other than that, did you wa 
Œ did you feel comfortable in Œ in
 England, 
in
 
Britain
? 
A: Yes, except we always felt a little bit 
like the outsiders. We were the refugees. 
At that time, 
Britain 
was not very cosmopolitan, espe
cially out in th e country , you 
know, 
London
 was a little different, but out in th
e country, you know. They didn™t 
know what Jews were. We sort of had 
to explain, you know. There was a woman 
who came from
 London
, once or twice Œ I think once
 a week or twice a week, I 
don™t remember exactly, to teach me Hebr
ew, which I still can™t read. And once in 
awhile, after things were not quite as 
bad, we Œ we had some relatives in 
Lo ndo n
, 
so we would go to visit them in Œ in
 London
 occasionally. Meanwhile, my  aunt, the 
aunt, my mother™s sister, the one who 
married the German, 
she had also been 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
12
 
 
interned in the 
Isle of Man
. And she was rel eased
, and she stayed in 
Lo ndon
 for Œ 
until after the war, and ev
entually came to the
 U.S.
 Bu t we would go and visit her 
too, but this was, you know, not while the 
blitz was going on. That Œ that was pretty 
bad.  
Q: Do you remember war Œ wartime sort
s of episodes or experiences while in 
Britain
, or was it blitz, and
 Cheltenham
 and Œ and this, yo
u know, inter Œ non-
interaction with Œ with the Œ the 
POWs,
 you know, that you were asked to do. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Were there mo re such things th
at Œ that Œ that are in your mind? 
A: Well, I remember listening to 
Churchill 
on th e radio. I mean, everybody listened 
to 
Churchill
 on the radio, and he made things, 
you know, he was very positive, and 
Œ and upbeat and everything. I rememb er th
e sound of the Œ the bomb s, you know, 
the Œ those things that Œ that made this noise. 
Q: The 
V2 
rockets? 
A: Yeah, and th en they  stopped, and then  
you knew they were gonna fall. And then 
when  we went to the underg round and 
Œ at night, we would come out in the 
mo rning and there wo uld be rubble a
ll over, because you know, the bomb  had 
dropped not far away. But 
the Œ the underground was 
very safe, and everybody 
went to the underground. I loved it, beca
use I Œ I have no sib
lings, and wh en we 
went to the underground, y
ou know, we™d go with our pi
llows and our blankets and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
13
 
 
everything, and there™d be kids
 to play with. It was wond
erful. On the platform, you 
know, we Œ we™d run around and have a great time. 
Q: What Œ what kids do. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: What kids do, and th ank goodness they do. 

A: Yeah, yeah. It was a very, you know
, su-supposedly norma
l childhood. But Œ 
Q: Do you remember 
V-E 
day? Do you rememb er th-the
 day th at war was over, or 
not? 

A: I remember I went to school, and the te
acher said, do you kno
w what day this is? 
It was 
V 
day Œ 
V-D 
day, 
V Œ 
the day that they landed at the Œ 
Q: In
 No rmandy
? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And, of course, none of us knew. 
Q: 
D-Day
, yeah. 
A: And she said, remember this day, beca
use it™s very important. There Œ the place 
where we lived, it wa Œ there was a Œ a gr
oup of Œ th-there was a Œ an American 
base not far, and so the soldiers used to 
come in, and I had a 
Œ a friend who had an 
older sister who, you know, th
ey used to go
 out with the 
G.I.s
 and everything. And 
we used to follow the 
G.I.s
, and we™d say to them, got
 any gum, chum? And they 
would give us gum. And 
we thought that was Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
14
 
 
Q: The coolest thing, huh? 
A: Œ the won Œ wonderful thing. So that Œ 
that was Œ that was really fun. So I Œ I 
really didn™t have a deprived  kind of child
hood. I had a Œ a really, you know, pretty 
decent, considering, you kno
w, when you look back Œ 
Q: The circumstan
ces, yeah, yeah. 
A: Œ and you think about wh ere Œ where I st
arted, and what happened, it was really 
pretty normal. 

Q: Did your parent try to get out of 
Vienna
 earlier than ™39? Do 
you Œ did th ey ever 
talk to you later, when you 
were older, about the circumstances, and the planning, 
and the, you know, everything Œ 
A: No. 

Q: Œ that went into leaving, and how they left? 

A: No, th ey never did. The only thing, af
ter the war, we Œ my father had a sister 
who married a doctor, and he su
rvived. He Œ I don™t know if 
he™s still alive, he lived 
in 
New York
, but I do Œ I don™t know if he™s still 
alive or not. He came to visit us in 
England
, and he told my  parents what went 
on. His Œ his wife, my  Œ my  aunt, and 
they had a child who died in 
the camps. And he told them
, but they wouldn™t let me 
listen. They sent me to bed,
 and said you Œ you can™t hear
 this. So I never did hear 
the story, wh ich Œ you know. 

Q: And this large, extended family that y
our father came  from, did mo st of them 
stay in
 Austria
? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
15
 
 
A: Just Œ well, one brother was severely beaten on 
Kristallnacht,
 I remember. I 
don™t know if he died after that, or if he
 disappeared, or wh at happened. Another 
brother was killed, I believe. His son is s
till alive, and his Œ his wife escaped, and 
they went to
 Ca na da
, and he™s my Canadian cousin. 
He™s Œ I just saw him a couple 
of weeks ago, we were Œ he Œ he goes to 
Florida
 in the winter. There was one Œ 
let™s see, w as that a Œ that was a Œ a brot
her of my father™s, and his family. He had 
wife and two children. They  died . They  st
ayed  in the camp s. As far as I know, my  
grandmother died, she never left. The rest 
of the Œ the family escap ed. My father™s 
family. My mother didn™t have a very big family, she had a brother and a sister, 
both of them went to 
Canada
. So they escaped. So, I ba
sically lost two cousins, 
several uncles, and a couple of aunts. But I have an uncle who went to 
New York
, 
and he is the father of the Œ the cousin 
who was the reporter, and I had another aunt 
who also came to
 New Jersey
, and when we came to the 
U.S.
 we stayed with them 
in 
New Jersey.
 She married a ma n who, he had also, he had co me from 
Austria
, I 
think he was a native Austri
an. But they Œ they had co
me earlier. And their son, 
who Œ who is another 
cousin  of mine that I™m very
 fond of, he was born in the
 U.S. 
Q: Post-war, while still in
 Britain
 Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ are there any Œ what ki
nd of a life was th at, in those first, post-war years? 
A: We left the little village where we had 
been billeted with this family, and we 
went to 
Cheltenham
 town , and we bought Œ my  fa
ther bought a house. You know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
16
 
 
it was a duplex, so he bought the Œ half of th
e house. And I went to school there, not 
liking school all that well, because they ma
de me do phys ed, which I didn™t like.  
Q: I share that with you
. I share it completely. 
A: I Œ I w Œ I went back to the school when
 I went with my family, and I said, could 
I look at my record? You know
, here you can look at any Œ 
Q: Sure. 
A: Oh no, we can™t show yo
u the records, they said. 
Q: School records? 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Because I Œ I Œ whenever we Œ th-they 
were very much into
 gymnastics, and I 
can™t do any of that stuff. And so when 
Œ when Œ whenever we Œ we would have 
one of these days wh ere we would have to
 perform for the rest of the school, and 
everything was in teams, you know, you were
 on this team, and Œ 
and you had to do 
things for the good of
 the team, and Œ and all that. I would stay home that day. And 
I reme mb er going back the next day and the 
headmistre ss Œ this was a girls™ sch ool, 
said to me, why weren™t you here yesterda
y? And she said, you weren™t sick, were 
you? And I said no. And sh e said, why were
n™t you here? And I said, I didn™t want 
to let my  team down. I thought that wa
s a good way to  put it. And th ey whacked 
you over the head in those days, they di
d. I would get whacked. Bu t, I could Œ 

Q: But were Œ were you made to feel like a fo reigner? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
17
 
 
A: We Œ we were never really considered
 English. We were always those people 
that came from 
Europe
, you know. And after awhile 
it didn™t really bother me, 
particularly.  
Q: Do you think it bot
hered your parents? 
A: It Œ I think it bothered my father, 
because he couldn™t wait to come to 
America
. 
He had family here, you know the Œ wh atever
 remained of the family  had come to 
the 
U.S. 

Q: Did th ey sponsor him in? 

A: Yes. The cousin, his father sponsored 
us in, and so we came . And I immediately 
felt much more at home, like I could be
long here, you know, it was a different 
feeling. Although I Œ I love the Britis
h. I go back and I love to go to 
London
 and  go  
in the theater and do all that kind of stuff. And Œ 

Q: I think you caught it right
, though, when  you said th
at, after the war, it was not 
yet a very cosmopolitan society. 

A: No. Right. 

Q: And it™s harder to integrate into British 
society than it is into American society. 
A: Yes, yes. And American society, even
 though I came here
 with a pronounced 
British accent, I went to high school, an
d people would say to 
me, talk British to 
me.  
Q: And they still do. 
A: But I don™t have the accent any more. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0569 
18
 
 
Q: Tell me, did you ever use German again? 
A: The only time I used it was when I was 
in college, and you had to take two years 
of language, and I figured o
oh, hey, this is gonna be easy. So I took first year 
German, which was hard because it was a 
lot of grammar, which I™d never done, 
cause I™d never gone to school in German
 speaking country. Bu t the professor said 
to me, don™t take second year German, be
cause you know the vocabulary, go right 
into third year German, which was ba
sically reading a lot of literatu re.  
Q: Literature. 

A: And it wasn™t in the old script, it was in
 new script, and so  I took that and then 
that was really a goo Œ the extent. We
 have been back to  German speaking 

countries. We took one trip 
for three weeks. We went to 
Germany
, 
Switzerland
 
and 
Austria
, all in the German speaking parts. 
And by th e end of th e three weeks, I 
found I Œ I remembered more wo
rds. And I Œ I said to myself, if I ever had to learn 
German to really communicate, I coul
d do it. Wouldn™t be a big deal. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

A: But it™s not something I™ve ever Œ I™v
e tried to learn Sp anish, you know Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ stuff like that. But I Œ I Œ I™ve really
 no desire to speak German, or to Œ we 
have a German club here, I™ve never gone. I just don™t want to ev en bother. 
Q: I understand. 
A: I have too many other 
good things to do here.

Q: Can you tell me when you started to l
earn mo re about the context of what had 
happened to your fami
ly, of what Œ what had happ
ened historically, politically? 
Were you already in the 
United States
? Were you already a Œ an adult? Or, through 
childhood, did you know ab out the 
Holocaust, did you know about Œ 
A: Well, when Œ when my uncle came to vi
sit us, I sort of got the gist of what 
happened, even though
 they wouldn™t let me hear all 
of the details. There was a lot 
of information. This was right after the 
war, and there was a lot of information in 
the papers. I think I was aware of what had gone on. 
Q: But it wasn™t that you had cu t Œ that 
there was something particular, you™d go 
home, you™d talk about it, your parents wo
uld have conversations with you, and Œ 
and that it was a per Œ a mo re personal as
pect because it could have been you. 
A: It could have been, yeah. No , I don™t th
ink so. It was okay, we™re here now, we 
have survived this, and now th
e next step is to go to th e 
U.S.
 We had to wait four 
years before we got here. 
Q: Oh, I see. So your father tried even
 from right at the very end of the war. 
A: Yeah. We applied immediately, and it 
took four years, and now Œ we came in

you would want people to know? 

A: Just that I don™t feel Œ you know, peop le say to me, where were you born? And I

, Vienna
, oh, that™s a wonderful city, and 
Œ and Œ and Œ you know, they talk 
about the mu sic and dance and ev erything.

no strong feeling about it. None. 

Q: No identity, no identi Œ 

A: No, no, it doesn™t mean anythi

Q: And you di Œ wh en you went back, yo

ized from the first six years of your life? 
A: No, no. 
Q: No.

Switze rland

not your heritage. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: So, I Œ I don™t have 
any Œ I would not Œ well, 
I Œ if I had to go to 
Europe
