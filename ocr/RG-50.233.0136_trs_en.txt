Interview with GeorgeTopas 
April 7, 1992 
Lakewood, New Jersey 
 
Today isApril 7, 1992.  I amAnthony Di Iorio and I am at the home of Mr. GeorgeTopas in 

Lakewood, New Jersey.  I am here on behalf of th
e United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to 
interview Mr.Topas about his recollections of the Ho
locaust and about the history of his family.  Good 

afternoon. 

 

A:  Good afternoon. 

 

Q: Could you first tell us some thing about yourself, where you grew up? 

 

A: Well, I was born inWar saw to a well- to
- do family on November 3, 1924 and I was brought up 
at home. We  had a villa in Shaborov which was 
about 20 mi nutes train ride fromWars aw in the 
country where I would spend the summers.  Later on I went to a Hebrew academy inWa rsaw 

and went through my grade school there, and ha
d my Bar Mitzvah inWa rs aw in the great 
synagogue and reme mbe r  playing in the parks an
d doing the things that kids do.  I had two 
brothers.  My younger brother was name d Syz m
on.  He was born in 1928, 27, excuse me , and 
was roughly three years younger than me  and I ha
d another brother Meir
 who was born when I 
was already nine years old, in 1934.  I reme mber 
his birthday in particular because it just so 
happens that my grandmother's sister and he
r husband and their young daughter, about my age, 
came for a visit toWarsaw fromAmerica and 
it was a big event in our lives to see the 
Americans visiting us.  So despite the language 
barrier between us kids
; because they could 
speakYi ddish, you know, the grandparents could 
speakYi ddish and my pa rents could speak, it 
was some thing of a sensation in our home  to s
ee, you know we were not used yet to see kids 
that were not disciplined, sort of dominate 
the attention of the w
hole household. And after 
graduating what you would call elementary school
 inWarsaw, I was admitted to gymnasium, 

which is high school and went there for one year
.  But about that time , the clouds of war began 
to gather and my father thought of sending me
 to agricultural school. 
 I guess the reasoning 
behind that decision was the fact, 
well there were several considerations.  One, that I was not 
doing so greatly in gymnasium. 
 

Q: You weren't the greatest
 student in the fa mily. 
 

A: Except for history which I took genuine interest. 
 I didn't show great promise at that time.  I 
don't know i n what order of urgency these considerations came but there was the consideration 

that Poland, they came and__________ for the Jews and 
my father already at that time, I think 

Austria was already next to Germany, and C
zechoslovakia was next in the frying pan and 
blackmailed by Hitler at the time, you know the w
hole incide nt with Sude tenland and so forth, 
that served as a pretext for German aggressi
on there. At any rate, my father felt that 

immi gration became i mperative for us and he
 felt that some one with a farming background 
would have a greater chance of being admitted to a foreign country than a merchant or 

professional.  I don't know just how true that wa
s but farmers were always readily admitted to 
countries like SouthAmerica and Canada.  Ca
nada was then considered unpopulated and my 
father me ntioned Canada as one of the possibil
ities of our immi gration.  So the decision was 

ma de that I should become  a far mer or at leas
t I should learn farming and I was sent to that 
school in a pl ace calledWa jenuswolinsky {ph 55} 
about 350 kilome ters southeast ofWa rsaw 
and I began my education in farming there. 
 

Q: All of 1938? 

 

A: This was the summer of 1938 because I arrived 
there just in time for harvest which wa s the 
worst period from the standpoint of work, the fact
 that we had to work nothing like we consider 
work today, from sunrise to sunset.  But once th
e harvest was over, then we began class work.  
As the season neared winter, work wa s progre
ssively reduced and class work increased. And 
that™s the way it went.  But of course, I never gr aduated from s c hool because the war br oke out. 
 

Q: Which work did you like or dislike the most, th
e schoolwork or the physical labor in the fields? 
 

A: We ll, I was not too much enamored by the wo
rk in the fi el d but I did like work with the 
animals, with horses and cows and other animals we had there on the farm.  I found it very 

interesting and I became a very good
 student there, too, so that 
school had from a standpoint of 
my upbringing and ma turing, had a ve ry favorable  effect on my attitude  towards learning and 

ma ny other things.  So much so far that I surpri
sed my parents when they
 saw my school report. 
 

Q: We re there other Jewish
 students at this school? 
 

A: There were only Jewish stude
nts at this school. This school
 was under the auspices of an 
organization calledTa rbot which I 
think is Hebrew na me  for cultu
re and the principle objective 
there was to train Jews in agri
culture so they can immigrate to 
Palestine and become fa rmers.  
This was also a consideration even though my fa
ther when he me ntioned Canada as a possible 
place for our immi gration, he considered Palestin
e as well but unfortunately, the British then 
had a policy of, a restricted policy of immi gration 
to Palestine and it is a strange thing that when 
we me ntion today Palestine, toda
y Pa lestine has a completely di
fferent connotation.  InWW II. 
The Palestine brigade that 
fought with the British 8
th
Army, c onsisted of Jews alone from 
Palestine, from Israel as it be
came .  Now the connotation conj
ures visions of intifada and 
ma yhe m and gang of cutthroats, you know that are  
 

Q: Anti-Jewish in a word. 

 

A: Anti-Jewish.  Right. 

 

Q: So this was a school that wa
s affiliated with the Zionists? 

 

A: Zionist orientated.  It wa s, 
you mi ght say it was soft on religion, 
aspect of it, but the religious 
life in the school was ac
cented to a certain degree and all 
the holidays were observed and so 
forth.  I reme mber that we did not work in the fields on a Sunday, besides Saturday, also not on 

Sunday in order not to offend the Christian peasan
ts in the area, to resp
ect because it was their 
day of rest.  So we were only working in
ternally on the grounds
, on the grounds proper. 
 

Q: We re there any Socialistic aspects in the school? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: So it was more religious? 
 

A: It was ma inly Zionist oriented and graduate 
students went to Palestin
e after finishing this 
school.  In fact, there was a reunion of survivor
s of that school in Israel in 1966, 1967 I think 

and I happened to be there for the Ba r Mitzva
h of my second son, Ma
tthew and we found out 
that there were about half a dozen
 survivors, all of them living in
 Israel except me , so they ma de 
it. They joked around and they said ﬁTopas re
mained the only Zionist among usﬂ.  Because I 
was living inAmerica and they were there and th
ey served in the Israeli army, one of them 
achieved a very high rank in the army. And only 
one of the fellows that graduated the far ming 
school remained a farmer. 
 

Q: Did you dream of going to Palestine dur
ing that year you we re at the school? 

 

A: Ye s.  I had my sites set for Palestine.  It was 
something very attractive to 
us, to be in a land that 
historically we take our root
s from a nd for a couple of millennium there was a continuous 
history of the Jewish people and since we ar
e persona non grata in Poland, in most of t he 
countries of the world in general, then Palest
ine loomed very largely in our consideration. 
 

Q: We re there any other reasons why you ended 
up going to this particul
ar school, do you recall 
what it was like to be Jewish
 and to go to public schools for 
higher education at the time ?   
 

 

A: I have never been exposed to, I have been
 only once in public school for a very brief period, 
one year that my mother sent me  to public 
school.  I don™t remember the circumstances.  But 
other than that, I was always going, for instance,
 the primary school that I went to, the prep 
school so to speak was a Hebrew academy, one 
of the most modern 
of it™s kind and had a 
religious orientation.  Modern. Then I went
 to gymnasium he nu which the Hebrew word 

denotes upbringing, you know. The n I went to th
isTa rbot Sc hool and I think the reason they 
sent me there was they wanted me to be in a traditionally Jewish environment. 
 

Q: How would you describe the 
religious life with your fa m
ily when you were growing up? 
 

A: Well the religious life with the family is really 
interesting in itself. To
 that extent that my 
grandparents were assimilated on my  father ™s  
side, not my mother ™s  side.  But since the 
grandparents on my mother ™s  side lived in a di
stance away from us in Forst we didn™t have 
much contact with them.  But inWa rsaw, we vi
rtually lived with our grandparents. We  were 
living in the same apartment build
ing.  My grandparents were a
ssimilated; they did not observe 
the Jewish holidays according to the law, mean
ing our stores were open on Saturday; although 

holidays like Passover and others we
re observed, they were observed to the extent they didn™t 
interfere with business. And my father was a 
very strong opponent of assimilation hims elf and 
he sort of fashioned hims elf or fancied hims
elf as a Polish patriot.  So in 1920 during the 
Bolshevik invasion, he joined the Polish militia at
 the age of 16, probabl
y not telling exactly the 
truth about his age.  He was so 
bent to have a part of it you know
 in defense ofWa rs aw.  But as 
he matured, he was exposed to the anti-Semitism that the assimilation did not make a damn bit 

of difference to the anti-Semites. All the Jews 
are the same .  So he was a thinking individual.  
One of his pastimes, his contemporaries told me
 was going to courts a
nd listening to trials 
because he liked the idea of logic expr essed a
nd the questions of law, questions of mor a lity, 
questions of right and wrong, very
 interested, good and evil.  So
 eventually, eventually, he 
became awa r e that, or he came to the conclusion, that assimilation for the Jews as a me ans of 

acceptance in a non-Jewish society was a failure 
and he felt it was a bankrupt. Although ma ny 
people at the time ma jority disagreed with him and he was a ma verick in his belief.  So at time  
already when I had reached the 
age of 7, he became religious. 
 

Q: So by the time  you were seven he 
had concluded that assimilation was 
 

A: He mi ght have concluded earlier but this 
was when he had made the move. And our house 
became kosher and so forth.  Because in my ch
ildhood we had a Christmas tree and we were 
well-to-do so it was fashionable at that time  to
 hire German governesses because they were so 
clean and disciplined and so forth and I reme
mbe r  kneeling and clasping my hands to say a 
prayer in German. This was inWarsaw.  But th
is radically has changed.  For my father became  
religious and began to realize that the values 
that are contained in our tradition now,Torah and 
our bible, are the values that are 
endurable, they are tested and th
at society, it is to benefit not 
only to the Jews but to ma nkind to live by a law wh
en morality is supreme, not other things.  
 

Q: Did you notice this when you were seven?   
This must have come  as a ma jor change. 
 

A: It was a major change.  In fact, I remember 
exactly the time when my fat her made me aware 
that I am a Jew.  Because I was sheltered you know in my life inWarsaw and in schools and I 

was not exposed to the, I never found myself
 in a situation where I was exposed to anti-
Se mitism nor did I understand what it really meant. 
We  lived in Poland so I was Polish. That™s 
the way I understood it.  But one time when we 
were in our country in the summer, I mi ght 

have been then seven, that I r
ecall that towards evening my fath
er called me  to the bedroom and 
he told me  to sit down.  I want to talk to you and 
he told me  very briefly that we are Jewish and 
that we were enslaved in Egypt
 because this is the core of 
our belief and of the historical, 
factual tenets of our belief and that we were 
taken out of Egypt to become  a free people., to 
become  a people to be a light to
 the nations.  He said a few th
ings that were just beyond me  
perhaps but then I came  to learn this and I wa
s taken out of the school 
I wa s going to and I was 
sent to a mo re religious orie
nted school. And we underwent 
a revolution and some where we 
were alienated from our larger family 
circle because of my fa ther ™s  change. 
 

Q: Your youngest brother then, 
he would have grown up from 
day one in a very religious 
household. 
 

A: You are very observant. That is exactly what  happened. Wh en I gave you the name s, I told you 
that my name wasYusick because I was born in
 the era when my father was in the mo od of 
giving Polish name s and my brother ™s name  wa
s given originallyin 
St anislav although his 
Hebrew name  that was given at 
hi s circumcision was Szymon just
 as mi ne was Benjamin Josef 
for Joseph Benjamin.  But when my third brothe
r was born, it was already in the era when my 
father ™s  orientation was completely changed, the 
name  that was given to him was Meir, after my  

grandfather ™s father.  He was brought in comp
letely different atmosphere from birth. 
 

Q: Would you describe your fa
ther as a strict father? 

 

A: I think that I would have to 
say yes, as a strict father. A
lthough he could have been quite 
relaxe d, you know, and forgiving on occasions, but he
 was strict.  He believed that the key word 
we have to focus our attention is righteousness. To
 him, this is all and al
l -- to be right, to be 
moral, to be truthful.  He felt that our civiliza
tion as we know it stands or
 fa lls with our ability 
to comprehend that. That this is significant.  Of
 course, today, this is all turned upside down by 

the new social science engineering which says
 everything goes and everybody can have his own 
style and so forth. 
 
Q: How would you describe your mother? 

 

A: My mother came from a religious home  but she was some what of a rebel.  Perhaps not 
consciously so but it was simply a question of eco
nomi cs.  She was born as one of four sisters 
to a family where the head of the household, meaning her father, my grandfather, HershAram, 

was a hat maker. And he was a working person a
nd he was alsoTa lmudist, studist. When he 
was not working he was spending his time in a 
house of study, in a religious house of study.  
Now, she did not see any, this is by conjecture, sh
e didn™t see future in following this tradition.  
Because they didn™t have  big dowries. At that 
time , dowries had to be given with daughters to 
anybody who was worth his weight in salt. 
 

Q: And you had a grandfather with four daughters. 

 

A: Yeah, four daughters and she was the second in 
lineage. Three of the four daughters we nt into 
the professions because they have seen they ha
ve to establish some  economi c independence.  
There was just no future for them in the town.  Excu
se me, in the town.  It is still a town.  It is 
now even more significant.  
I guess Poland calls it the capital 
of petro chemicals in Poland.  
And I revisited the town when I was there in 1989 and I found the apartment where my  

grandparents lived and possibly where they brought
 up these four daughters.  Now, this, in the 
United St ates would be way below poverty level 
because the whole apartment consisted of one 
room and a kitchen and six people 
lived there.  It is just hard to believe. And I reme mber 

visiting there on Passover and my fa ther woul
d take us there and they were always 
immaculately clean.  Everything was so perfect -- 
they didn™t have running water. They didn™t 
have a bathroom, no plumbing there.  It was just 
a bewilderment when we first came to visit.  
My father already became religi
ous at that time because before, we didn™t go there. And it was 
contrast  of two worlds that were completely, you know, there was the cosmopolitanWa rsaw 

with floors that were polished to a mirror sh
ine with two maids in my grandma™s home and 
plumbing and a bidet in the bathroom and all th
e conveniences and amenities of modern living.  
Whereas in Proust, it was backwards, only by contra st and they had to live there very frugally.  

So my mother must have realized early in her lif
e that her future lie with her ability to support 
herself and to ma ke something of herself, ot
her than just being a woma n and going through the 

biological process.  Her older 
sister Franya, you™ll find out in
 my book, they™re in furniture, 
you™ll find out that she had two boys and she wa
s ma rried to a painting contractor but she 
herself was a teacher.  My mother was going fo
r law but she ma rried a wealthy husband, a well-
to-do husband, a me rchant, a businessman and 
Idacha the younger sister became  a CPA, you 
know a public accountant .  I don™t know if she was certified, if such a thing. 
 

Q: Anotary? 

 

A: She was definitely a notary and she wa s also a bookkeeper. And the youngest one was with the 
fa mily.  I don™t think she went in to a profe
ssion; she remained at home and never married.  
They all perished in the Holocaust, except my gra
ndfather who died a few years before the war.  
The youngest daughter ™s name  was Razel.  So this
 was the background. When my mother came 
toWa rsaw, she __________ in the university in the 
school of law.  In other words, you must 
realize that I believe  that only 5 or 3%  of the 
Jews could be admitted to any state institution.  

She had first to get through high school, an ei
ght year course. As she said in her own 

application here the doc
ument that I obtained from the arch
ives, she says on her basis of her 
entry examination she was admitted to the state™s gymnasium.   She covered a course of 8+ 
course in 7 or 8 years, pe rhaps in 7 years. A
nd then she was admitted to University ofWa rsaw.  
Before, they had this clause about bench clause
 and father rest rictio
ns but there were still 
restrictions about how ma ny Jews c ould be ad
mitted. And she had two handicaps -- being 
Jewish and being a woma n. 
 

Q: And being from a s mall town, byWa r saw standards. 

 

A: ByWa rsaw standards.  So in order to support he
rself, one of the jobs she had was a tutor to the 
Topas boys.  So she was a tutor to my father
 and his brother Itzak 
and his youngest brother 
which was my uncle Ben. And this is how
 people fe ll in love with the tutor. 
 

Q: Not everyone has such a beautiful tutor. 

 

A; Well, the results were predictable. 

 

Q: Your father was smitten. 

 

A: He must have been. And he ma rried very 
young.  My mother at the time was 23 and he was 19 
when they ma rried. 
 

Q: Did your grandparents have any say in this ma tte
r?   It must have not 
been the planned ma rriage 
of their dreams. 
 

A: Indeed, it was not. As I unders
tand it in retrospect, they were 
very much opposed to it, because 
in Europe it was not like in the United St at
es where you have mi salliances between rich and 
poor and between professional a
nd non-professional. There wa
s a class-consciousness, even 
among Jews  so that it was unlikely that a pe
rson from a well-to-do fa mily would ma rry 
some one from a very poor fa mily by contrast. 
And my grandparents were opposing too on the 
ground that the fact that they wanted some one 
from a more prestigious family than some  
obscure town in Poland and they didn™t  like the 
idea that my mother was older than he. Four 
years older. They didn™t like that.  
But apparently they were overruled. 
 

Q: By your father? 

 

A: Probably by my father.  He wanted to have hiswa y.  My mot her was never very happy living in 
such close proximity to my father ™s fa mily beca
use she realized the obje
ction and she realized 
she was ma r r ied over these objections. 
 

Q: Interesting.  How about
 your father ™s  brothers? 
 

A: My father ™s  brothers were not affected by th
is religious revolution and my uncle Neteck which 
was the second in line was a very handsome ba
chelor as you can see from the existing 
photographs, who was a bachelor  for a long time
 and didn™t get married until pr obably maybe a 
year or two before the outbreak ofWWII and hi
s position in the company was that he had the 
job of admi nistrator of the pr
operties that my grandparents po
ssessed, owned, and he was also 
the head bookkeeper in the company that fabricat
ed shoes,Topaz Shoe Company.  But I have 
very fond memories of my uncle the bachelor.  
Bachelors have money.  Married people have 

responsibilities and bills. And he lived with the grandparents. So my brother Szymon a nd I and 
my cousin Lela, which wa s the daughter of my fa
ther ™s sister  Bella Necovyak who lived with 
them there, we would come  on Sunday morning 
when my de ar uncle Neteck was still sleeping 

in his room from the Saturday night outing tryi
ng to recover, we would be waiting for him to 
wake up sort of helping the process and then 
we would mooch from hi m movie mone y for the 
ma tinee to go and see the movie. And we would 
scan the daily paper to tell him what are the 
choices and he would open one ey
e and say are you here already. And he knew to buy his peace 
he had top give us some  movie mone y and then we would ask him for transportation for the 

streetcars.  So me times he would say, ﬁIt™s such
 a beautiful day, why don™
t you go to the park? ™  
ﬁ Why do you always have to go to the movie? ﬂ Th
at is one of my fond 
me mories that he was 
very generous that way. I also reme mber that 
he bought me  my first two -wheeler.  My parents 
probably couldn™t afford it, even though th
ey were well off but they had expenses. 
 

Q: Andkids. 

 

A: And kids. That means the same. 

 

Q: Now I reme mber that your brother, from your de
scription, he had to have
 been a hell of a nice 
guy.  I don™t know whether he was a great student. 
 

A: Who is that? 

 

Q: Youruncle. 

 

A: Neteck?   I don™t think that he
 distinguished himself particularly
.  He graduated high school.  He 
mi ght have taken a course in bookkeeping and 
admi nistration, I don™t 
know exactly.  But the 
one who distinguished hims elf scholastica
lly was the youngest son, Benack.  He was 

distinguished in ma ny s ports t
oo, that™s  why we reme mber hi
m. The newspaper clippings 
would tell us about his pr owess as a soccer pl
ayer on a team called Hapoyal which was one of 
the first line teams inWa rsaw.  It was a Jewish
 team.  Hapoyal means the worker. That didn™t 
sit well with my grandparents who first of a
ll were opposed to any so
cialist ideas and my 
grandmother thought it was a sheer waste of time to
 be engaged in sports of any kind and incur 
an injury or some thing like this and I unders
tand he incurred an in
jury and he had blood 
infection.  But I reme mb er that when he gra
duated high school and I was still then very young, 
he didn™t want to go or perhaps he couldn™t 
get admi ssion although he was a very good student, 

to the University ofWa r s aw and he wanted to go
 for chemic al engineering.  So he went to the 
Polytechni c in Prague in Czechos
lovakia, and became  an excellent chemist in his field.  He 
survived the war and when he came toAmer
ica he couldn™t get any employment.  But 

eventually he  got a job with Dutch copper a
nd later on with Merck Pharmaceuticals when he 
distinguished himself in silicone research and made some pittance for them and later on became 

a director of research and went to Marshall Rectify in LosAngeles and he told me  one time that 

the rectifier that weighs about 
a ton ma de by General El ectric wa
s made by him that weighs as 
much as a book of ma tches. 
 

Q: We  were talking about your uncle Benack, the chemical engineer. You we re saying that he went 
to Czechoslovakia to study. 
 

A: In the German Polytechnic there. 

 

Q: In the 1930™s? 
 

A: In the 1930™s , yes. 

 

Q: Just before the Nazis came  to Czechoslovakia? 

 

\A: He graduated before the Sudenland, before 
the occupation.  He must
 have graduated around 
circa 1937. 
 

Q: What was he planning to do?
 When he finished graduati
ng, what would he have done in 
Poland? 
 

A: We ll, in fact he did graduate and he got a 
job with a sub clinical lab in Poland so he wa s 
gainfully employed as a chemical engineer. 
 

Q: InWa rsaw? 

 

A: InWarsaw. 

 

Q; And what were you hoping to become:  I reme mb
er you were interested 
in history and also you 
had an inclination toward animal husbandry af
ter that first experience at the college in 
southeastern Poland. What was on your mi nd to be? 
 

A: Well, once I got my feet wet in
 this agricultural school that my 
parents sent me, I really became 
fired with enthusiasm for being a farmer.  
I thought it was a great 
life, I thought it was a 
meaningful life because being close to the soil, y
ou are close to nature and it is a very healthy 
life and since there is some ideological being as
sociated with it because of Jews, basically we 
are a nation of far mers and freeholders.  If you st
udy ancient history, you™
ll find out that in it™s 
classical period, the kingdom of
 David and the kingdom of Solo
mon when the fortunes of the 
Jews were at it™s highest peak, most peopl
e were fa rmers. There were some  __________, but 
they didn™t have a class of me rchants.  In fact 
in Israel, when they s
poke of me rchants, they 
spoke of Canaanites. The Canaanite me rchants, 
they used to come  to temple grounds and sell 
trinkets or  whatever  it was.  I am told there was a slogan, a motto that was displayed at the main 

road leading to the school buildings as you woul
d approach the field because we had a 50 acre 
far m there and the name  was, said in Hebrew
 ____________ .That means for us to return to the 
plow as we have moved from the plow to the sc
ale, meaning to me rchants.  Because the Jews 
were forced in medieval times and even in earl
ier times in exile, they forced out of so ma ny 
avenues of life, they couldn™t own land, so they wound up as businessmen.  So the stereotype of 

a Jew as a businessman which emerged in Europe
 was not the true echoes of the Jewish people 
as it was then. At the time of Moses, that cam
e not out of propensity of the people for that 
particular subject but because of
 necessity.  So I felt that we 
are going to turn the clock of 
history and we will straighten this out and we 
will become farmers again.  Idealistic I was fi red 

with enthusiasm, not on a single argume nt, but on 
all these that I have mentioned by others but 
that I cannot think of now. 
 

Q: So this reversal of me dieval
, social engineering so to speak. 
 

A: Yeah, me die val, social engineering. 

 

Q: I reme mber earlier you described the fa mily
 reunion. The relatives fromAmerica and the 
differences in the way in which children beha
ved and also the language. What were the 
languages used in your fa mily? 
 

A: We ll, my gr andparent s spoke to them inYi ddish
 because this was the language that was always 
used as a back up language. Also used so that
 we wouldn™t understand it --
 they wanted to say 
some thing to each other.  My parents were also 
fluent inYi ddish so that I think this is the 
language they used. They mi ght 
have reverted to Polish because, 
still, my grandmother ™s sister 
and her husband came fr om Poland. They emigrated only afterWorldWa r I there. They still 

reme mbered the language so they could speak
 Polish but their daughter, Jean, was a very 
beautiful gi rl -- she was actually my
 brother ™s age.  I reme mb er they went for a walk inWa rsaw.  
They got lost and finally we got a call from the po
lice station that they found them in the park.  
They were lost and they came to the police sta
tion.  Someone from the adults took a taxi and 
brought them back.  She couldn™t speak Polish but
 she knew a littleYiddish that she picked up 
from her parents and we just didn™t  
know -- we communicated by body language.  
 

Q: Which languages did you norma lly speak? 

 

A: Polish. 

 

Q: Polish.  I imagine you studied Hebrew? 

 

A: Hebrew, yes, yes. 

 

Q: I reme mber a little bit of German 
earlier on.  Did you study German too?    
 
A: I took German as my -- there was a choice given 
in gymnasium, usually in Poland.  It was either 
French or Ge rman. The r e was a choice. That™s
 besides Hebrew and, of 
course, besides Polish.  
Some times they would give you an option of Englis
h. We  didn™t have this option.  But I learned 
English anyway through a tutor. 
 
Q: So your household, would you describe it 
as being a Polish- speaking household? 

 

A: Basically it was a Po
lish- speaking household. 
 

Q: That didn™t change your father underwent his ____? 

 

A; Thisdidn™tchange. 

 

Q: Now, your uncles that we  me ntioned. They di
d not experience the same  religious conversion 
that your father did: 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: They continued to participate in the assimilated culture? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: We ™ve me ntioned the shoe store.  Perhaps we
 should describe how the store was founded and by 

whom?   I know the name  of the st
ore was The I. JacobTopas St ore. 
 
A: Right.  But I think the founders of the wholeT
opas Enterprises were actually my grandfather, 
JacobTopas and my gra ndmother Etta SaraTopas.  It™s hard for me to determine after such a 

long time something that I was not private to, 
just exactly who had 
greater share in the 
dynami cs of the expansion of this.  But it starte
d from a very modest 
beginning.  Because after 
ma rriage, my grandmother tried to develop the ta
lent that my grandfat
her possessed.  He was a 
person who modeled ladies™ shoes.  
He had a flair for this so she e
xploited him to the extent that 
she wanted to set up a store that would ma nuf
act ure handmade, custom-made shoes that would 
have his imprint on it, hi s model.  I think this is
 the way it originated.  Fi rst, I think that they 
had a place on Pyskas St reet but by the time I wa
s born they already had 
a flourishing store in 
Wa rsaw, in the same  building where we had also 
an apartment.  Later on they opened two more 
stores inWa rsaw, one on Noves ______ and one on Mar________ which was the ma in 

thoroughfare ofWa rsaw.  But eventually, towards 
the time  close before the outbreak of war, 
only the main store remained functional.  Becau
se they found out that they don™t need three 
stores inWa rsaw, that people will come to this
 store.  Because  it was unique, because of the 

hand-ma de shoes. This shoe store catered to the 
intelligentsia and to the theater circles; people 
who could pay a good price for a good pair of shoes. 
They were not inexpensive. Then we also 
opened a store in Katovitz before the outbreak of th
e war.  My father ran that for a while but the  
Polish governme nt forced him out by saying that
 they are not going to 
allow anybody to set up a 
store who was not a citizen as of 1920 or some th
ing like this.  Some restrictive measure that 
were calculated against Jews,  So we had to liquida
te that store also about six months before the 
outbreak of the war. 
 

Q: That™s interesting.  So the anti-S
emitism of the Polish government was --? 
 
A: Wa s also economi c. 
 

Q: Economic, yes. And of course, th
ere was no Polish state before 1918, 1919? 

 

A: I really don™t know what they used as a cutoff date
 as to who is allowed to have a store or not to 
have a stor e.  Because initially we had represen
tation there, so me one that had stores of shoes 
already and was just buying our shoes because 
there was a dema nd for them. The demand was 
so great that we decided, I m
ean my parentsandgrandparents, 
decided that perh
aps they should 
open a store there where they can also benefit 
fr om these sales to a greater extent  than 
wholesaling it.  So they went 
ahead and did it.  But this di
dn™t  sit well probably with the 
me rchants -- shoe me rchants in the city and they
 put pressure on the offi
cialdom to out stop us. 
 

Q: We re there any other changes 
regarding your father ™s  companies™ business situation?   I know 
there were other laws being intr
oduced in the late th
irties at this time regarding Jews.  Did you 
know of any ---? 
 

A: There is one event in the history of our busin
ess that I only know s
econd hand from my uncle.  
He was closer to the center of
 action there than to know it. 
 He claime d that the Polish 
governme nt had a war debt.  I think pr obably 1920Š1919, 1920, war with Russian Soviet 

Union. That the Jews were disproportionately, ve
ry heavily assessed to pay this.  He told me  
that my grandfather, in the cour
se of several years, had to pa
y some thing which would be in  
American pre-dollar value, a quart er of a milli
on dollars but in Polish curre ncy was close to a 

million zlotys which was a unit of Polish currenc y was defi ned. The ratio between one was like 

five zloty to a dollar. 
 
Q: Was there any chance that perhaps one of the stor
es was liquidated in order to help to pay this 
off? 
 

A: This is quite conceivable.  It mi ght have been
 because I know that some  real estate wa s sold in 
order to meet that --- those demands.  Becau
se my grandparents owned land in the country 
where we had our villa. (End of SideA,Ta pe 1) 
 I was me ntioning the properties which my grandparents owned. They also, as I understand, had 
a building in Berlin. This date
s to the time that Poland was occ
upied; the occupation of Poland.  
They also had an apartment house in Danzig.  
But by the time  I was born, all these properties 
were liquidated or sold, possibl
y to meet the dema nds of the Polish government. You know, the 
assessment as to how much of the debt is taxabl
e to us.  Poland had a peculiar labor law.  It 
permitted occupation strike which me ant -- in actu
al experience this is what  happened.  Our 
shoes were hand ma de.  Most of the shoema ke rs which were employees were kind of the 

cottage-industry type me aning one who was thema ster craftsma n e mployed journeymen and 

helpers, apprentices in his own 
household.   He would come  to 
our office and get the ma terials 
and the models and so forth and he would bring 
the ready-ma de products and was paid for it.  
He was paid in advance and he was paid when he 
finished it.  If there were some  corrections to 
be ma de, he would have to do that too.  So th
ey were individual shoema kers, perhaps a hundred 
or so that were ma king the shoes for our comp
any.  Now they became me mbers of a union.  I 
reme mber distinctly that a few years before the 
wa r, there was a strike 
but they called it in 
Poland an occupation strike, which meant that they
 were permitted to come into the stores and 
occupy the seats that normally are 
reserved for the customers.  Bu
r the strike provided that they 
had to leave enough seats so that business can 
continue.  Because I cannot conceive of a 
customer feeling comfortabl e in a st
ore where there is a hostile strike. 
 

Q: A labor conflict? 

 

A: Conflict, right.  So I recall that st rike and I reme mber an incident ther e that  was largel y 
discussed and talked about later. That one of 
the strikers, a heavy big 
guy, not only did he sit on 
the chairs but he stretched himself across severa
l chairs to occupy.  My father took him and 
forcibly threw hi m out the store. 
 But the thing that st
ruck me  later is that
 I don™t recall that any 
of the non-Jewish firms were ever affected by such 
a strike. This strike was eventually resolved 

and everything then returned to norma l, but it was 
one of those things that the Jews were not the 
first-class citizens in Poland. 
 

Q: Even if they were well off? 

 

A: Even if they were well off, I would imagine. 
 Be cause a Jew always has to prove hims elf as a 
citizen.  For instance, when the threat of war 
loomed against Poland and the Jews wanted to 
show their loyalty, especially 
against Germany s o there is in
 a book called Image Before My 
Eyes by Lucien Dobritsky, there is a photograph of
 a Jew donating actually a military aircraft to 
the Polish air force as a show of patriotism.  But it didn™t help. 
 

Q: As if anyone could have suspected or expected 
Jews to be in favor of Germany in such a war. 
 

A: But they said -- the Polish parliame nt, whic
h was only debating since the death of Puchentsky, 
was only debating I should say since 1935, was only 
debating the Jewish problem and attributed 

all the economi c reverses or problems to the Jewi
sh question of being a large ma jority there.  
Although the largest ma jority were re
ally Ukrainians, mi nority I mean. 
 
Q: Minorities,yes. 

 

A: We re Ukrainians.  But this was 
most of -- the Jews disturbed them. 
 

Q: So the Jewish problem was the gr
eater one than the German problem?  
 

A: Because they ma de it so. This was whatwas deba ted. When a Jewish me mber of their 
parliament, their Same as they called it, came 
out and he said that we should confront; we 
should unite and should confront
 a common ene my; so the response was that these are two 
separate questions. That the Jewish question 
and the German question have nothing to do with 
the Jewish problem. That™s th
e way -- that was the answer 
 

Q: The workers, the people who ma de the 
shoes, were they non-Jewish or Jewish? 
 

A: Non-Jewish.  In that -- shoema kers were al
l non-Jews.  Now there ar
e people  which are doing 
the tops and they were mostly Jewish because this
 is some thing that trade that falls within the 
sphere of Jewish interest for some  reason or another. 
 

Q: The customers would be of all faiths? 

 

A: Ye s, very heavily Christian.  Because 
the product was known and you still can find people 
today that are of my age who live inWarsaw; th
ey all reme mber the shoe store inWarsaw.  
Because it was a known firm, it was a known na me. 
 

Q: Now, 1938, which was the last year you were inWa
rsaw before the war; that was also the year 
when the Germans were expelling Polish Jews back
 to Poland.  Do you have any recollection of 
any of that?   Did you witness any? 
 

A: Ye s, we seen people with bundles that were 
some times seen on the street.  My father would 
point out to me  and say these ar
e refugees from Germany. Also we seen photographs in the 
newspaper, pictures in the news
paper of the rioting. The storie
s that were behind them; where 
they were stripped of German citizenship and th
e Polish governme nt declared quickly that they 
stripped them also of the Polish citizenship.  
So they were people without citizenship; it was 
very sad; it was a foretaste of
 things to come  to an unima ginable proportion and degree. 
 

Q: Earlier we were talking about 
patriotism, the Polish patriotism of your fa ther.  I recall when we 
were looking at the photographs, that you me n
tioned other family me mbers who were involved 
in vari ous patriotic efforts; either  when Pola
nd was just becomi ng independent.  I™m referring to 

the war against the Soviet Union in 1920. Then I 
reme mber too, there is some one who is in the 
Russian army at the time of the Russo-JapaneseWar? 
 

A: Ye s.  Poland, as you know, was occupied and 
didn™t  regain its independence until 1918 and 
prior to this, it was partitioned and occupied
 by three ma jor powers which was Germany, 
Austrian-Hungarian empire and Russia. Wa rsaw
 was ma inly under the Russian influence and 
Russian zone, so to speak. The Russian governme nt
 tried to -- they had 
a very strong intensive 
program of r eciprocation, so the language in
 high schools was Russian and Russian was the 

language that you had to do business in Poland, in
 official Poland. Also when people were 
drafted into the army, they went to the Imperi
al Russian army.  Now my
 grandfather,probably 
still a bachelor, was drafted into
 the Czar ™s army and was sent
 to Manchuria during the Russo-
Japanese war.  I rememb er him telling me stor
ies of how cheap life was, of how many times 
they executed Chinese. The Russians were executing Chinese and they we re fright ened of the 
Russians. The Russians mi ght have cast the f
ear among the Chinese; they didn™t do so well 
with the Japanese because we know that the outco
me  of the war was not favorable to Russia.  
But he served with them.  I don™t know, I couldn™t tell you just how long.  I know he was with 

his friend who became his brother-in-law later becau
se they married two sisters when they came 
back from the war, back toWa rsaw.  My 
future grandfather, JacobTopas married my 
grandmother EstherTopas.  So this was one experi ence of the military.  I don™t think my 

grandfather volunteered but my father did volunte
er to the militia as I mentioned before, during 
the Bolshevik invasion and was very 
patriotic that way.  In fact 
my father served in the Polish 
army later on already because there was a cons
cription, also Metek served in the Polish army 
for a short period of time.  My father was anon-commissioned officer in the Polish army and 

after serving it, probably at a time  when I wa
s born, he also had to go periodically.  He was 

recalled for maneuvers and for a few weeks of what
 they called exerci ses, military exer cises.  
My father be lieve d that we, the Jewish people, should be loya l rega rdless of anti-Semitism 

regardless of the inequities that  existed in the so
cial sphere of life, the economic discrimi nation 
--that we still owe allegiance to the country that
 we live in.  In that respect, there was no 
question about it.  He was also a realist and he 
knew that we have to get out of Poland because 
we are an endangered species there. 
 

Q: My recollection is that even your mo ther was 
involved -- in describing her experiences at the 
University ofWa rsaw and then
 the tutoring work that she di
d. There was a document that you 
showed me earlier---. 
 

A: Ye s. That document showed that afte
r graduating high school in 1918, 1919, she, during 
vacation time, did volunteer work in what they 
called Polish soldier home, which is apparently, 

I would imagine it™s a convalescen
t home  for soldiers that were 
injured in that 1919-1920 war.  
So she was briefly employed there or volunteered he
r services.  She introduced that  certificate 
and other certificates similar wh
ere she worked as a teacher in 
a school sort of to support her 
application for law school in theWarsaw University. 
 

Q: This was in 1920 when she was helping, 
helping to care for 
the Polish soldiers? 
 

A: Soldiers, I think so. 

 

Q: Which would have been the mi ddle of that war? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Ye t, one of your fa mily me mbers was considered 
not to be a citizen of Po
land?   Or not a citizen 
of Poland early enough?   I reme mber when 
you were talking about your store and --. 
 

A: All right. This was not a citizen of Poland 
but a citizen of the city. This is kind of a 
discrimi nation, sort of compartment -- put in di
fferent compa r tments. You can be in this 

compart ment but you cannot be in the other compar
tment. What it meant is that our fa mily 

opened a branch of our store -- I think they opene
d it probably in 1938 ---. After six mo nths of 

existence, the Polish government of the city 
of Kapolt ______ ordered them out because they 
claimed that they were not citizens of the city, 
or  dwe l l e r s  or  re s i de nt
s of the city at some  
undetermined time which would otherwise by implication permit it.  Justify them being there, 
prusterick. 
 

Q: Of course, Katavista was near
 the German frontier and I imagin
e they were more paranoid than 
usual of all the border area. 
 

A: I think that basically they 
couldn™t possibly -- they couldn™t que
stion my father ™s cr edentials 
since he was a reserve non-commissioned officer
, volunteer in a war against Russia.  It was 
simply a question of economi c discrimi nation. 
 

Q: Economic a nti-Semitism regardless of patriotism?  

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Now meanwhile you were off to the east, studying to be a farmer.  I imagine you had mixed 
feelings. You obviously liked bei
ng near animals. You wanted to be a farmer and yet you were 
far away from home . Yo u had left the big city
 and now you™re in the sticks.  I suppose.  For 
Poland that  was the sticks. 
 

A: You™re going to ma ke me say things which ar
e in my book, really. I am fir m about that but you 
are very perceptive in understa
nding that some one who came from a big city suddenly changes 
his environment to a very raw surroundings in a 
sense -- that we had to haul our own water, 
even in our dormitory and we were always expose
d to the elements. The creature comforts that 
our home pr ovided were very remote there.  It
 was not easy to get assimilated there.  I 
reme mber fr om the first class -- there were maybe th
irty students that  started the cour se.  By the 

time of the fall harvest,
 of the potato harvest, it was redu
ced to about twenty.  Because the 
others quit, just packed up and went home  becau
se it was just too tough for them.  But with me, 
it was very tough and I was always on the verge of
 quitting during the harvest.  But I said --  I 
felt that it wa s an embarrassment to come  home  and say that I failed.  So I said, let me  see if I 

can hold out at least another week because it doesn
™t  look good to come  afte
r the first week.  So 
by several such resolutions, I extended my stay
 beyond the harvest time. 
 Eventually I got to 
like the school and I took prid
e in being able to work ther
e and being knowledgeable about 
crops and about animals and animal life. Anything th
at relates to this type of life interested me.  
I had a genuine interest in it that was developed 
by a very dynamic teacher and director of the 
school, a fellow name dYachim Scholinsky who s
till lives in Israel. A very dynami c person 
who ma de study an exciteme nt.  He put exci
teme nt in it which you don™t norma lly find in 
classr ooms. 
 

Q: Where were you when the war broke out? 

 

A: When the war broke out, I was in that school. 

 

Q: Al most harvest time  again? 

 

A: We ll, it was past the harvest time  because the war broke out on September 1, as you know, and 
the harvest usually starts in the mi ddle of June a
nd continues up to this point.  Hitler did very 

well by waiting for the Poles to gather  for him, a
ll the harvest and put them
 in barns where they 

can easily have it picked up for their own use a
nd for the army™s  use, there was feeding off 
Poland, 
 
Q: We re you surprised by the outbreak of war? 

 

A: Ye s, I was surprise d by the reality of it not 
about what you read in the papers.  Because the 
movies and the papers, they create a di fferent im
a ge and illusion of what 
things really are until 
you are really directly affected 
by them. The outbreak of the wa
r was exciteme nt and sort of 
loss of interest for school subjects. The school
 authorities suspended classes and they had 
dismissed all the students to go to their respec
tive hometowns except for 
the contingent from 
Warsaw.  Because they saidWarsaw is under 
bombardment and for our own safety, we will 
rema in in school.  Because our school, I think the war broke out on Friday morning, I think on 

Sunday our buildings we re already occupied bythe Polish army because they were quartered 

there. 
 

Q: In what other ways does the war affect you?  School is closed, Polish army takes over the 
school, your home  is besieged by German forces --? 
 

A: Not yet, at the very beginning, but it wa
s under heavy pressure and bomba rdme nt because 
Warsaw -- there was a mass bombing raid onWars
aw before the war was declared. This was 
done on September 1
st
 
 

Q: And those continue
d, the bombing a ttacks? 
 

A: Ye s.  Some times I think, I don™t know if the war 
was declared, ma ybe at ni
ght or at 10 a.m. but 
it was already much later, hours already into the 
race where most of the Polish air force already 
was wiped out on the airfields before they got up in
 the air.  So they definitely were taken by 
surprise -- those that shouldn™t have been ta
ken by surprise. We  heard on the radio Friday 
morning at breakfast time, we h
eard about the attack onWa rsaw a
nd about the war.  Of course, 
there were mi xed e motions. There was a lot of 
exciteme nt but there was also great concern.  

What does it mean? Wha t  does it portend?   But th
e authorities were very reassuring. They said 
the war will soon be over and everybody will 
go home .  I don™t know whether by this they 
meant that Poland will win the war or there w
ould be an armi stice a
nd the newscasters were 
very bomba stic and enthusiastic 
in their reports.  Of course, we
 didn™t know, we didn™t have the 
idea, the ability to be cr itical . We had no critical  
ability to be able to sort of digest the essence 
and what truth is in it. You w
ould hear -- a broadcaster would sa
y like this : The Polish cavalry 
is fighting in East Prussia like wild lions.  
 

Q: You had never seen a wild lion before? 

 

A: But that was a kind of metaphor meaning that th
ey are fierce fighters and also that they are -- 
the Polish army is advancing on Berlin.  I mean 
this was like on the first or second day of the 

war. When England and France joined the war on
 the third day and we could hear the English 
national anthem and the Marseilles played over 
the radi o, there was literally -- the newspapers 
were hysterical. They felt that th
e war is going to be finished in a ma tter of -- in a short time .  
Nobody really predicted any specific 
time but the feeling was that it 
was just a question of time.  
 

Q: That Poland would win? 

 

A: That Poland, together with
 England and France would win. 
 
Q: When did you realize that 
Germany would win this one? 
 

A: When they told me  that -- and I was in the city of Lublin -- that the Germans would be here in 
one hour.  In a city and Lublin was under bombardme nt. 
 

Q: It™s way to the east. 

 

A: It™s pastWarsaw, right. 

 

Q: What about the Russian invasion
?  Did that come  as a surprise? 
 

A: It was anti-climatic but it came also as a 
surprise.  Perhaps to ma ny peopl e it was a we lcome 
surprise because out of the two 
evils, ma ny people thought 
that if they went to the Russian zone 
-- in the beginning it was very easy when they 
divide because the border was not firm -- there 
was an influx of people both ways and they we
re not yet -- they didn™t have yet a strict 
instruction, how to handle the 
border move me nt across the bo
rder.  So that anybody that 
thought, believed that he was better off being on 
the Russian occupation than German -- a lot of 
people ma de that choice and then they went.  
They ma de a wise choice because they had a 
greater chance of survival in Russia even those w
ho were sent to Siberia. They were displaced, 
they still had a better chance of
 survival because there was no 
deliber ate effort by St alin to 
destroy the people, no ma tter what nationality. 
 

Q: Unless they were Kolaks or _____________ 
or bourgeois or  _____________ of production. 
 
A: Or Polish officers in Katin. That™s  an interestin
g aspect of the Polish officers in Katin that ma ny 
people don™t know about it. A lot of Jewish of
ficers were among these Polish officers and they 
were killed including the chief chaplain of the Po
lish army. The Jewish chaplain of the Polish 
army. 
 
Q: What was your greatest prior
ity in September 1939 as your worl
d is falling around you?  What 
is your --? 
 

Q: To be reunited with my family. 

 

Q: Reunited with your fami ly inWa rsaw? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: What is happening to your fa mily inWa rsaw? 

 

A: I didn™t really know wha t  was happening to my 
family.  I could not establish contact.  I don™t 
know whether the telephone lines 
were still functioning 
in the few days of the war but I know 
that I managed to send a telegr am to my mother
 asking her to send me  mo ney for a ticket to go 
back toWa r saw.  I don™t know whether she send me  the money in time  or whether the 

authorities ga ve us the money to buy the tickets b
ecause eventually they relented and they told 
us that we can return toWa rsaw.  I think therewere about five or six 
of us that imme diately 
began to pack and go.  I reme mber a very intere
sting incident. When I wa s in the post office 

standing in line to send a telegram, there wa
s a line -- the post offi ce also had the national 
savings bank of Poland which was called PKO,________________ -- that means Polish Fund 
of, Saving Fund, which was governme nt fund a nd 
people were using savings books.  So there 

were two Polish wome n standing in 
line talking to each other and 
very patriotically that they 
still have confidence in the Po
lish governme nt and that they are depositing. They were 
depositing, 
 

Q: Eventually you do return toWa rsaw? 

 

A: I didn™t make it toWarsaw.  I never made it to
Wa rsaw. The irony of it is and you can find it in 
my book that when I came  to the cashier ™s 
window in ____________ with other students, I said 
Wa rsaw.  So she said the eastern railroad sta
tion or the ma in?  The eastern being on the east 

bank of the river, the ma in being in
 the center of the city ofWa rsaw
.  I said, ma in.  She said that 
will be 50 cents more or something like that . 
 

Q: They charged you for it? 

 

A: I gladly paid for it because I had sufficient  funds to pay for it. The irony of it was that we never 
got nearWa rsaw. 
 

Q: We ll, you didn™t know it was surrounded, right? 

 

A: Of course.  Not only was it surrounded because the train traveled for about 40 or 50 kilome ters 
and the railroad tracks were going skyward. 
 

Q: The aerial bo mbardment ? 
 
A: Right. There was no further railroad transpor
tation --from there on, we were on foot. We  never 
got any further than Lub
lin, the city of Lublin. 
 

Q: In retrospect, retrospective knowledge, what 
were your family experiencing inWa rsaw during 
these months? 
 

A: You mean, actually weeks of the war? 

 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: What was not known to me  and I found out late
r by mi raculously meeti
ng with my father in 
Lublin is that the Polish governme nt -- there is 
a controversy about it by 
historians.  So me  claim 
that the Germans, on Polish language gave the or
der in Polish to theWarsaw population that all 
able bodied men of military age should march eas
t for mobilization where they going to make a 

defense deeper in Poland, in the country. This
 was given on the night, I 
think, of the sixth or 
seventh of September. Then my father and hi
s two brothers were of
 military age and the 
followed these orders. They ma rched east of th
eVi stula River and they ma rched east without 
any specific destination but they
 continued to ma rch east where 
they were being strafed by the 
St uka planes.  But this order, a few hours late
r wa s countermanded.  I think the name  of the 
officer that gave the order, 
countermanded it, was Roma nowski. 
 By that time, it was already 
too late.  Because I think the afterthought wa
s they wanted to defendWa rsaw and all the 
ma npower that would have done the defense left 
Warsaw.  So my father and his two brothers 

were actually on the road with thousands upon 
thousands of me n and easy targets for the 
German Luftwaffe to strafe and to kill. The cas
ualties were tremendous.  
Eventually my father 
lost contact with his two brothers
 in the confusion that ensued 
and he got as far as Lublin. I 
found hi m on the evening of Rosh Hashanah, Ne
wYear ™s, in the synagogue where I went to 
pray.  I lived there too and I seen my father there. 
 
Q: So it was a chance encounter? 

 

A: Yes, it was unbelievable because there were
 thousands upon thousands of refugees that 
converged on Lublin and flooded the town way beyond its norma l population. 
 

Q: We re the rest  of the fami ly back inWa rsaw
, were they affected at
 all by the bombardment?   
We re there any ---? 
 

A: Ye s, the building that we lived in, the artillery de
stroyed part of the roof 
of the building.  One of 
the bombs struck the courtyard and killed a c
ouple of people who were in a doorway, didn™t go 
to the shelter.  I was also told 
that there was a ma id in our buildi
ng, in one of the store that were 
in the building -- there was a drugstore by the name
 of Prusak.  Prusak was a very nice ma n.  I 
think it was a fa mily store.  He was the son of
 the owners and used to give candles and other 
things to kids when they came in with parents.
  He , some how, got set on fire by a firebomb and 
became like a human torch and was burned alive during the bo mbardment . They had no water 

because all the facilities 
were disrupted so people literally had 
to travel to theVi stula Ri ver with 
buckets to br ing water. The utilities were not 
rest ored until the Germans took the city at the end 

of Septembe r. 
 

Q: So your brothers, your mother, your grandparents --? 
 
A: My grandfather, not grandparent
s because grandma left for United St ates on the last ship before 
the outbreak of the war. 
 

Q: That™s  right.  So grandpa is 
there and what was the plan?  Wh en
 your grandmother left to go to 
America, what was the plan? 
 

A: The plan was that she is able to help us in
 some  way.  Possibly to see if she can send us 
affidavits so we all can go.  Because she went on 
a tourist vi sa and ostensibly to see theWorld™s 
Fair.  But in reality, she had a sist er living ther e 
that visited us a few years earlier. They were 
bakers here.  So she went to see this sister.  
My father and the family here hoped that she would 
be able to help because  by that
 time it was already too late.  My grandmother was granted a visa 

and, of course, after obtaining 
the visa, she had to buy the ticket. The name  of the shipping 
company in Poland is called Orbees to this day. 
 

Q: The same  company? 

 

A: My fa ther later told me  that ther e was such 
a me lee in the offi ce of wives of i mportant Polish 
diplomats and government officials, they were 
asking to get a ticket. They had no problems 
with visas and so forth but they were sold out
. They would say that they would sleep on the 
deck of a ship if there were no more cabins. 
You know, they couldn™t ge
t it; they knew already 
what was comi ng. 
 

Q: This was on the Puzutski the ship? 
 

A: Ye s,Puzutski. 

 

Q: Interesting that some of these people had le
ss confidence in Poland™s ability to withstand the 
German attack. You me ntioned a family of diplomats and so forth. 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: So your grandmother was able to help you fromAmerica? 

 

A: Ye s, well this happened some times later.  It
 was not-- after the order was restored in the 
occupied Poland and they allowed return to 
Wa rsaw; we left probably already in October 
some ti me , in later part of October; by horse 
and wagon rather than by train to come  back to 
occupiedWa rsaw.  My father imme diately pro
ceeded, engaged people to 
repair the building, the 
roof in the building and to restor e it because 
ot herwise we wouldn™t have shelter. And it was 

actually in the later fall, perhaps in November 
of t hat year, we didn™t get packages. We  got 

affi davits for the whole family to go to the United 
St ates.  My father studied these affidavits and 
debated whether he should go to German authorit
ies to obtain permissi
on to leave.  I don™t 
know what specific reasons were given but he neve r ma de use of these affidavits because the 

fear was that there were alrea
dy some other people that haveAmerican relatives reported and 
they were imprisoned. This was very strange 
becauseAmerican was not at war with Germany 
at the time.  So we never made use --Œthere 
was great excitement a
nd expectation, the great 
expectation -- but it sort of
 was left in abeyance.  Bur later on
, of course, we didn™t feel it so 
badly at that time but soon fa mi ne came and Russian
 and all this. And things got progressively 
well. Then the packages began to come fromAm
erica, from my grandmother.  She used to send 
an average of six packages a day.  In the course
 of two days every me mbe r  of the fami ly would 
get a package. 
 

Q: And you would be able to correspond with her? 

 

A: We  could correspond with her. The ma il was going, it was censored, we had to be careful what 
we are saying. We  couldn™t ma ke any complaints. 
We  understood this, that we have to be brief 
in expressing. We  had to sort of
 let her read between the lines. 
 

Q: How long did these packages continue to come ? 

 

A: The packages came until the breakdown of the postal system in theWarsaw Ghetto, meaning 
until the Germans put an end to it which was a fe
w months before the deportation toTr eblinka, 
the big action as they call it, the Grossactuen 
which would put it in May of 1942. The  packages 
became sporadic, eventually there was a cut off 
point but they were our lifesavers because the 
fa mi ne in 1941 became very severe.  If you read
 the notes, the Ringlem notes of theWa rsaw 
Ghetto, you™ll find out that people 
were dying at the rate of 400, 500 a day.  It was twice as 
much already in ™42. These packages were a th
ing that ma de a difference between us living or 
dying of hunger.  Because we had no other resources 
that I knew of at the time. We  ha d some  
hidden shoes but it was very dangerous to sell th
em even in a clandestine fashion. The rations 
were not enough to sustain life.  I reme mber duri
ng the time of fa mi ne in theWa rsaw Ghetto in 
1941 that the children would just go 
in groups on the streets, after 
the curfew; I think the curfew 
was 8 p.m.  But it was not dark yet during the su
mmer mont hs so they would walk on the streets 

barefoot with the swollen legs and beg for alms
 and beg for food.  One of the standard lines 
they would say,Ya n___________ which means I don™t want to surrender my ration card.  
Surrender meaning dying, so they were beggi
ng for bread.  My parents would always do 
some thing, however inconsequential this 
would have been to withstand this. 
 

Q: What did your grandmother send? 

 

A: The packages that we would get, I have a f
eeling, were not some thing that she, herself, 
prepared. There must have been an agency that handled and she just paid them for it.  But it 

had canned goods like sardines, it had coconut butte
r, a can of coconut butter which was very 
useful because my brother, my youngest brot her 
Meir, had a touch of tuberculosis and he was 
spitting with blood so he needed that. They 
would send us Salem LiptonTe a, I reme mber.  
LiptonTea was worth its weight in gold becau
se you could get -- coffee and tea was at a 
premium, above other commodities except maybe for 
bread.  So some of these things we used 
and some  of them were sold in order to buy bread. 
 

Q: So she helped feed you and she essentially
 gave you the wherew
ithal to supplement? 
 

A: She gave us a lease on life. 

 

Q: Ye s. And everyone received a package? 

 

A: Well, everyone received a package by fa milies. 

 

Q: Who would she address 
it to? To your -----? 
 
A: Different names of our family me mb ers.  Bu
t we understood who was -- it was for Shimatopas, 
it meant it was for our family. 
 
Q: For everyone, yeah. Wh at happened 
to the shoe store under the occupation? 
 

A: We ll, in 1939 I believe, in Nove mber, late 
October or Novemb er, the 
Germans had arrived and 
confiscated all the shoes.  It was quite -- the shoe
 store was closed already and they came  in.  I 
reme mber when they were standing; they rang 
the bell in my grandfather ™s apartment which 

was one flight above the shoe store in the sa
me  apartment building.  It was a four-story 

apartment building with a courty
ard in the center and apartme nts
 surrounding it.   I reme mber 
the chief gendarme said, Is das de grochen _________?  _____, IsaacYacobTopas?   So when it 

was answered in the affirmative, then they  gr
aciously told him that he could keep some thing 
like 20 or  30 pair of shoes, or whatever. They gave him a receipt for it and they said the rest 

will be confiscated and he  will have  to help to 
load up the trucks, himself.  He and my father 
and people that were caught on the 
street to help out with this, 
so there was kind of a, like a 
bucket brigade carrying the shoes to those trucks that were being loaded. 
 

Q: Do you remember when this was? 

 

A: I would have to look in my book for  exact date 
but it was either in -- the closest I can think, 
Nove mber, more likely Nove mber 1939. 
 

Q: So the Germans knew who your grandfather was? 

 
A: We ll, they had information about sh
oe stores and businesses and so forth. 
 

Q: I was tryi ng to imagine when we were talking 
about the affidavits earlie
r, the reasons why he 
wouldn™t pursue that and I thought to myself, well 
perhaps he didn™t want 
to call attention to 
hims elf, especially since other people were 
being arrested. ---presen
ting yourselves to the 
Germans?   
 

A: We ll,  I have a feeling, because this ha ppene
d later, even more so. That anyone, this wa s 
probably among the Jews more prevailing this, th
at reported to the Ge
rman authorities and 
showed they had affidavits and wanted to l
eave forAmerica, the Germans could let them go, 

they could tell them to go home , or they could 
put them in prison. We  knew in Poviac  which 

was the mos t  wholesome prison inWa rsaw that they had some  Jewish fami lies that had 

American --. We didn™t even want to let th
em know that we hadAmerican relationships 

although the packages would have indicated this.  
But they didn™t care.  Food packages is this 
kind of thing, that it doesn™t  ha
ve any political significance. 
 

Q: But it™s curious that the Germans we re conscious
ly trying to starve the ghetto ofWa rsaw and 
yet they allowed the food packages to come . 
 

A: Absolutely.  Because it was a drop in the bucket.  Maybe they would feel differently if it was a 
real organized Jewish effort inAmer ica to send 
packages by the thousands to cover most of the 
people in the city. Then they w
ould say that it would be counter to
 their policy of starvation.  In 
fact, my gra ndmother ™s sister with whom sh
e lodged at the beginning after she arrived in 
America, there was a limit on what she could ta
ke.  She couldn™t take currency, just a few 
hundred dollars, from Poland when she came over to visit.  But she had some  jewelry and she 
was using that to cash in the jewelry to send 
us these packages.  But that was not enough and 
she had to go and sought a job and found -- became a nurse, kind of a live-in nurse with a 
paralyzed woma n so the income  from this, from
 working as a nurse, she would use to send us 
these packages.  She is a big hero
ine in our family.  She did this 
and her sister, I found out when 
I came to the United St ates, was trying to dissuade 
her and would say, Itala, that was her name  
she was called by. What are you doing?  What
 are you knocking yourself out?  They are not 
going to get these packages. The Germans ar
e going to confiscate all these packages.  
Therefore you are doing it in vai
n.  My grandmother, and this 
was a very persuasive argument 
because it is always easier not to
 do some thing than to do some thing, kind of a law of gravity, if 
she listened to her, we would have perished s
ooner.  I probably wouldn™
t get the point where I 
can start my concentration camp career. 
 

Q: That™s right. 

 

A: I wouldn™t get that far. 

 

Q: You ma y not have survived the ghetto either. 
 I mean there were all kinds of ways of not 
surviving. 
 

A: Absolutely. 

 

Q: Do you recall any other -- I can reme mber you 
had an introduction to farming and no doubt you 
were able to put some  of that
 training to use in the ghetto? 

 
A: We ll, the training of the far ming stood me  well 
in several ways.  First 
of all in that school, it 
was a bodybuilding process. The hard work.  I became, I was what you call a strong fellow, a 

young ma n.  Secondly, it gave me  the knowledge of agriculture and ability to work on a farm.  

In theWa rsaw Ghetto there was an organizati
on called Toporol, T- o-p-o-r- o-l, which stood for 

____________, means a society supporting agricultura
l work. That opened courses in the 
Wa rsaw Ghetto for people interested in this 
and I took those courses. This way I became 
affiliated with this organi zation. 
 (End ofTa pe 1.) 

 In the summer of 1941, perhaps even in the la
te spring of 1941, theTopor
ol organization, that 
organization that was dedicated 
to the agricultural work, sees 
an opportunity of utilizing all 
empty and vacant lots of buildings or just squares -- to ut ilize them in growing vegetables for 

the starving ghetto.  Of course, it was a puny effo
rt in comparison to th
e need where you have 
half a million people, nearly half a million pe
ople, starvi ng in the walls of the ghetto.  But 
nevertheless, the effort was necessary even if
 the produce that came from all this work was 
distributed to the students that were working on it
.  Because it was not that much that they could 
-- it would be very difficult for them anyhow to ge
t it past that point.  
I was at a time, already 
sixteen years old and I was ma de, appointed, one 
of the instructors.  I reme mber there was a 
large plot, yard in the street, Leshner St reet
, not far from where we
 lived where I had two 
groups of students that were comi ng.  One for 
two hours and then the next one for two hours 
and I was showing them how -- we were working 
those lots and I was showing them how to do 
it. They were very eager kids, even some  of 
the m were, of course, undernourished. They were 
very enthusiastically interested 
in the work and doing this work.  
In fact, one of the girls that 
was in the group, not in my group but in the group 
of another instructor 
who was sick and I was 

sent there as a replacement one time to fill in,remembered me  long after the war and sent me a 

letter to this effect, which became an appendix 
to my book.  She is trying to find out whether I 
am the same  person who acted as an instructor  at
 the time . These kids were very eager and we 
were planting lettuce, radishes, 
toma toes, I reme mber, cabbage, ve
ry basic things in a kind of 
garden farming or tract farming as they call it.
  I was also assigned on a Gensha St reet prison 
and I also reme mber working at a ceme tery on Gens
ha St reet and there was a very stark contrast 
between what we were doing. We  were pruni
ng toma to plants for the living, while perhaps a 
100 feet from us or less, there were people being buried in ma ss graves.  Usually the me thod 

that was used, they were using a chute from th
e back of a wagon into those graves. The work 
was going on all day. Those people were being -- 
the dead were being collected.  By that time  
the fami ne was very severe.  I was occupied wi
th this job, which some times the reward was to 
the students and the instructors that they c
ould pick up some  of the crops of their own 
handiwork, own labor and I think th
at the instructors were also ge
tting, weekly, a 
loaf of bread. 
 

Q: We re you an instructor as well? 

 

A: Yeah, I was an instructor. That was what we 
were getting above the students, the people that 
were comi ng in these groups.  In the end of June 
of the same summer, a call went out from this 
organization for able bodied me n, whom they ha
ve on their roster already, to report for 
volunteer work in the states around th
e Lublin district to help with 
the harvest.  My parents very 
quickly consented to me  to go. They would have
 one less mouth to feed and the conditions in 
ghettos were very bad.  By that time , my 
brother Szymon also already had a touch of 
tubercul osis.  He was spitting bl ood. This is even 
with the help of the packages we were getting 
fromAmeri ca.  It was just not enough. We  we
re shipped to the district of Lublin and we 
worked there. We  were quartered there and work
ed there.  Even after the harvest I managed to 

stay there until Febr uary of the following year.  
This was a very significant factor in my own 
personal survival from the standpoint that I was ab
le to eat normally durin
g that period of time 
and live in a healthy environment of the country, 
quite a contrast.  In fact after I had been a 
month on those estates, I thought to bring my 
brother Szymon there, some how. There was a 
small post office and I managed to make a phon
e call to a store that was opposite to our 
apartment building.  My father came to the phone a
nd I told him about this.  He said that my 
brother Szymon didn™t look like a Jew and he could 
pass for anAryan easily -- that he should 
come  and join me , that he should send him out ofWa rsaw.  He came and he stayed for a few 
months.  Of course there was a pr
oblem there.  He got homesick a
nd eventually he left and went 
back home to the ghetto. 
 

Q: Because he was homesick? 

 

A: Ye s, because  he was homesick.  But I did not 
go until it was absolutely -- I found out that it was 
dangerous to live there because we no longer, we  were no longer needed there for the harvest in 

February, right?   So in Fe bruary, I returned. We
 were almost shot in Denblin en route by the 
German authorities who did not recognize our 
pass or came within seconds of not telling you 
this whole story. There were ma ny s uch inci
de nts because I was also involved in smuggling 

and I cannot go into this. There was just 
too ma ny scheme s and escapes and whatnot.  I 

returned to the ghetto in February, found out that
 my grandfather, JacobTopas, the founder died 
a few months earlier. 
 

Q: InJanuary? 

 

A: From typhus  epidemic that was raging in the 
Wa rsaw Ghetto from fa mi ne because the sanitary 
conditions were very poor at
 the time and the overcrowding 
brought in lice and lice begot 
typhus.  So you had everything together.  But appare
ntly all these things that the Germans put in 
operation to strangulate the economic life of theWarsaw Ghetto and to bring the demi se of the 

Jews, didn™t happen for them fast enough.  So the inev
itable thing is that th
ey had to resort to a 
more drastic me thod of bringing 
about the end of the Jewish 
community inWa rsaw and in 
Poland.  InApril of 1942, a reign of
 terror started in the 
Wa rsaw Ghetto. We  began to talk about 
building shelters; some thing was impending, we di
dn™t know exactly what. The packages from 
America stopped comi ng.  I forgot to menti
on that whenAmerica entered the war, my 
grandmother resorted to ---.  She was very
 resour ceful, she cont acted some one in the 

Portuguese embassy or consulate and the packag
es were comi ng -- the 
point of origin was 
Portugal.  Portugal was neutral so we were 
getting packages probably until spring of 1942.  
Then the whole postal system, the whole ghetto sy
stem began to break down. The Germans, as 
I me ntioned to you, launched a reign of terrorinApril of 1942. They kept it up.  Later on I 

learned that  this reign of terror was to paraly
ze the will of the people to resist for what was 
comi ng., for  what they had in store for them. Th
at was the ﬁresettleme ntﬂ action.  Resettleme nt 
meant shipme nt toTr eblinka.  It started by them
 posting the declarations 
or the ordinance that 
the Jews should report voluntar ily to the umschl
agplatz, the umschlagplat
z being the depot from 
which the trains were leaving forTr eblinka.. Th
ey would go east, they would obtain shelter.  
Those who report voluntarily w
ould receive jam and bread an
d surprisingly enough, the first 
day, which was July 22
nd
 and this happened to beTi sh a™Bov, the day of mourning for the Jews 
for the two destructions of 
the First and SecondTe mple in 586 B.C. and 70A.D. by 
Babylonians and Roma ns, respectively; so th
e Germans launched this action. The key 
ingredient in carrying it
 out was deception.  Deception being 
that the Jews were promised to go 
to the east where there™s work, shelter for them and they imagined that  nothing coul d be worse 

than the ghetto so the poores
t of the poor began to report to
 the umschlagplatz with their 
luggage,. The Germans tolerated it. The firs
t shipment, the people received the bread, they 
received the jam, they were able to take thei
r luggage and they were put in the box cats and 
shipped away.  But within 24 hours, rumors spre
ad as a wildfire, that someone escaped from 
this transport and that Treblinka is really an
 extermination camp.  I reme mber that evening 
when we heard it in our homes ---. 
 
Q: So already in July of ™42 ---? 

 

A: Ye s, I think within a day or two we alrea
dy knew whatTr eblinka meant.  Many people didn™t 
want to believe it, we believed it.  In these 
circumstances-- by that time my  brother and I were 
already in a Luftwa ffe camp, my brother Szymon. 
 In other words, he -- we both report as 
volunteers to go to Luftwaffe ca mp yet before 
this action was launched. This was kind if a 
transi tion fr om the agricultural work into the Luft waffe camp  and this was a forced labor 

column. We  were not quartered there; we were
 still living with our fa mily and were just 
comi ng to a point at theWa rsaw Ghetto gate where two Luftwaffe guards would take us to our 

job.  Some times they used streetcars for part of the trip. There was a pl
ace called Bilanie; there 
was a big storage of Luftwaffe equipment, paints
, and ma intenance things for aircraft when we 
were supposed to work.  But initially they got 
us cleaning bricks in bombe d-out houses.  I don™t 
know why but I said to myself, we 
are back in the brickfields, we 
are back in the brickfields.  
Symbolically we were reduced to the status of
 our ancestors in Egypt.  But this still was, 
comparatively, benign to what was in store for us
 in this forced labor column. When the action 
was launched, as I me ntioned before, on the seco
nd and third day, there were no volunteers to 
go to the umschlagpl atz.  So the Germans be
gan isolating and putti
ng a dragnet on certain 
sections of -- block by block of the city and 
emptied the houses. They also would come in, 
when the Germans ca me  to conduct this with th
eir trucks and wagons, some ti me s, they usually 
ma rched people, those that could ma rch. T
hose who were already immo bile, they were 
handicapped or they were so st
arved that they couldn™t walk, 
they threw them in the wagons 
and they took them that way. They could come  in and announce that they would respect all the 

passes because the people were working for German industry; they were working ma ybe for the 

ghetto governme nt, like the Judenrat; they were 
working for the city ornundines which was the 
police; ma ybe they were working for the hospital; 
they would be all exempt
.  So they were ---. 
 

Q: They would respect these passes 
in the east after resettlement?   
 

A: They had an assorted degree of 
authority that in the beginning, they respected them all. As the 
time went on, they were less and less respected.  
I didn™t have any pass so that if I was caught, I 
probably would have been shipped out toTr eb
linka too because we were simply assembling 
every morning before the action started, however
, early in the morni
ng to go out and were 
brought at the end of the day, to the point, to
 the gate and then we were on our own to get 
home ..  But after this action went
 into effect and was already in
 effect for a week or two, once 
we came to work, the captain said when you co
me tomorrow to work, br
ing your things with 
you because you™re going to be here, interned fo r your own protection. Then he looked at the 

faces; he passed all of us in revi ew.The w
hole group of about two hundred people.  He looked 
at my brother and he said he cannot come  to
morr ow, he™s too young.  He also, ma ybe, exempted 
another kid and that was the end of it.When we
 c a me  home , t he ghetto was in such a state of 
terror besides this, that
 the German SS me n were riding in
 rickshaws. You know wha t  the 
rickshaws were? They were those bi cycle-pe
daled three-wheelers where the passengers are 
sitting in the front and the bicycl
e-peddler in the back. They w
ould ride in the bicycle-pedaled 

rickshaw and they would be firing at the windows
 at the people and the crowds wherever they 
see them..  So we were literally dodging bulletswhen we were comi ng back from our work.  Of 
course, after that incident , after we were told th
at we™re going to be inte
rned there, I realized 
that I™m going to have to part from my fa mily. 
The morning after this, when I got up in the 

morning, my father was still praying.  I said 
goodbye to my mother and she was packing some  
of my things that I was going to take with me
.  I said goodbye to my sweet brother Meir, my 
youngest brother, Meir, and to Szymon. Then my 
father gave me  a blessing; it was the first 
time I™d seen him cry in my life because he was 
a very steady influence.  He was a very self-
possessed individual and confident 
that some how we™re going to ge
t through this whole ordeal 
and so forth.  I don™t know what was going on in 
his mi nd but if I did not
 realize it, he must 
have realized that we are parting for good. 
 

Q: You didn™t realize it? 

 

A: No.  I was too much of an optimist.  I was t
oo young.  I™m s ort of a romantic in a sense that I 
think that hope can overcome reason. 
 

Q: And you had ma naged to come  back before.  
I imagine that you had a feeling that some how you 
could ma nage.  From Lublin the first time, andthen comi ng -- I imagine each time you walked 

back from work, there was sort of a feeling of
 survival, giving the random violence that was 
going on? 
 

A: Correct.  I also had faith th
at evil cannot vanquish good.  So in
 the long run, I don™t think that 
there was any doubt even by those who perished th
at Germany will be defeated and that they™re 
going to win the war. The question is when.  Bu
t there was no doubt that
 Hitler will lose that 
war and that theAllies will pr evail and win.  But meanwhile, we were in their grasp so such 
optimis m has a limited value and effect on your we
ll-being.  Of course when I took my last 
glance at my  father, that was it.  I haven™t seen 
him again nor my parents. 
 I went to this camp.  
We  learned that in October,Yom Kippur, th
e Day of Judgme nt, was the last day of the 
shipme nts toTr eblinka.  In fact, the Jewish 
police had the honor of being put in the last 
transport toTr eblinka because they were promised
 that if they cooperate
 in the round-up of the 
Jews in theWarsaw Ghetto, that they and thei
r families would be spared.  So they and their 
fa milies on the Judgment Day were spared until that point  but then they we re also shipped.  I 

guess ther e was some poetic justice in that . 
 

Q: Symbolismatleast. 

 

A: Right.  I began to realize th
at if I wanted to know what ha
ppened to my parents and to my 
fa mily, I would have to return t the ghetto.  Bu
t you just simp ly cannot say I am leaving. We  
were by that time already interned, we were pris
oners, we were not free
 people. Although there 
was such a nebulous air about it as to exactly what 
is our status there. We  worked there; they 
intern us for our own protection. That means if
 we leave, we  are just taking risk with the 
protection.  But, in reality, you c
ould be shot for leaving without 
permission.  I began to plan an 
escape. The way I went about it, I reported that
 I am a shoe maker by trade and that we have 
people here whose shoes need repair.  If they 
are going to continue to work, some one has to 
repair their shoes, that I should be given the oppor
tunity to do this.  In 
order to do this, I need 
tools and equipment and I can get 
these in the ghetto.  So they
 send me  with a guard to the 
ghetto.  On the second such trip, I escaped.  I left
 the cart waiting. Then I began to -- I had to 
go where our home was.  By that time, the ghetto wa
s reduced in size. There was what they call 

Niemand™s Land that means Nobody™s Land and it wa
s not permitted to be there but there was a 
group that the SS e mployed in theWa rsaw Ghe
tto of Jews which wa
s calledVe rtafastak.  
Ve rtafastak was sort of a clean up group that wa
s confiscating all the --
 collecting all the goods 
of the people that were no longe
r there.  Furniture, books, bel
ongings, clothes, whatever else 
those that we re deported toTr
eblinka left behind.  It was a bi
g operation and a large contingent 
of these who were working. They would be doing 
it by streets..  I reported to work with such a 
group and when they went there, I separated mys e lf from them by just ---. There were so ma ny 

people walking upstairs and downs
tairs and there were only a c
ouple of guards usually at the 
gate.  I went on the roof and through the roof I wa
lked to the roof of the adjacent building, came  
down and eventually got to the area of my own bu
ilding which, of course was deserted.  But I 
found out that behind iron doors, back doors of 
one of the delicatessen stores, which really 
delicatessen in Poland means some thing else, me an
s like a grocery store. 
 I found out that the 
survivors there who knew me  and 
who were tenants in our buildi
ng, that my mother perished, 
that she was one of the first -- in one of the early
 raids -- and they told me that my father mi ght 
still be around but they don™t know. Eventually 
I me t in this Niemand™s Land another person 

who had a store also in the buildi
ng.  His name was Bart and he told
 me  to look; he told me  that 
there is reason my father and my brother surviv
ed in there someplace, perhaps in the camp.  
Without going into much detail, I never found 
out anything more beyond that except returning 
once with the group I found that my Uncle Melek su
rvived and he™s now in the small ghetto.  I 
went to him.  He, in turn, told me  that my 
grandmother, my maternal
 grandmother survived by 
hiding herself in a clothes chest a
nd her sisters, three sisters.  
 

Q: These are your mother ™s sisters from Pl
utz who were moved to theWa rsaw Ghetto? 
 

A: Right. They survived and they were on U
_______Sreet, not exactly where my uncle was.  I 
went and found them and I lived there because ther
e were also two kids in there, while I was 
working for thisVe rtafastak operation.This I did 
this until January,  In 
January, I heard a rumor 
about cleaning up the umschlagplatz 
again so I went to the arbeizen
 which is the work office.  I 
was sort of casing the joint as the word goes 
and I found out that another Luftwa ffe guard came 
in with a Jewish forema n or leader and they 
were looking for volunteers. When I ascertained 
that they are not from Bilanie but from anothe
r place, from Or cencia which was the airport, the 
largest airfield to
 this day inWa rsaw, I volunteered for 
this group. Also forced labor column 
and I was able to stay with my aunts and just
 go every morning to work.  But when the action 

started and the Germans surr
ounded the ghetto on January 18
th
 or 19
th
, 1943, I found myself in a 
dilemma-- Œ how to get -- the problem how to ge
t out and rejoin the group and not get caught in 
the net, in the dragnet.  Ev
entually throughVi su_______ who is a friend of Mead who was an 
artist in the process of painti
ng the picture of the commanding offi
cer of the airport, he and his 
brother, and a few other fellows
 gathered that morning and a call was ma de to the Luftwaffe 
camp from the Polish precinct. Polis
h police and they sent guards 
and brought us there. There 
we were for a while until theWa rsaw Ghetto upris
ing.  In the interim, I 
made another foray to 
the Warsaw Ghetto with another 
guard to obtain some  things fr
om my uncle, some clothes he 
gave me .  
 

Q: UncleMelek? 

 

A: Uncle Melek. The book tells you about the detail
s because I had a fight with him there.  But 
this I felt that he was hoarding some  stuff that 
he got from the  shoe store and that he wa s not 
sharing it with me. Anyway, by that time, theWa
rsaw Ghetto was already in its resi dual stage, 
was in the final days of its existence.  By th
at time, we didn™t know a
bout it, but the resistance 

organization already was functioning.  One of 
the things was when I visited my uncle under 
guard, from this Orcencia Luftwaffe camp, there wa
s a shot fired. We  run to the window and 
we found out that there were just 
two Jewish civilians that fired and killed one of the informers, 
Gestapo Jewi sh informer. You could see that th
e Germans di dn™t interfere with it, they didn™t 
care.  InApril 18
th
 or 19
th
, I think, the Passover ma rked the 
Wa rsaw Ghetto revolt which was a 
reaction to the German entry to the ghetto to st
art to ﬁresettleﬂ, to liquidate the ghetto. Also 
from Orcencia, some  we apons were smuggled to 
the fighters in theWarsaw Ghetto.  I didn™t 
know it, exactly how they did it and who was ---.
  I was not among the insiders.  Fr om our 
airfield, planes took off to bomb, firebomb th
eWa rsaw Ghetto by the Luftwaffe and we knew 
about it. As theWa rsaw Ghetto was going up in 
flames, rumors spread 
that they™re going to 
liquidate all the camps aroundWarsaw including th
e one where I was interned.  It was a small 
camp, a little over 100 pr isoners. 
 
Q: It was run by the Luftwaffe? 

 

A: By the Luftwaffe. We  were working at th
e airfield. There was 
aYunkirst enterprise, a 
dismantling division of aircraft, 
shot down fighter planes over 
Germany that was brought in 
there. This is how the weapons got some times in
 the hands of the fighters. They were found in 

these planes.  I think on May 12
th
, we were being, we were sent to theWa rsaw Ghetto under 
guard. At that time , theWa rsaw Ghetto was al
ready in ruins but the fight was still going on.  
We  were taken to the umschlagplatz and shippe
d to Majdanek.  I didn™
t know about it but we 
found out we were shipped to Majdanek, we deci
ded not to jump the train, not to ma ke any 
efforts, because we knew we were on a line that 
was not going toTr eblinka; we established that 
point.  But it turned out to be that we were slat
ed to go to gas chambers anyway.  In Majdanek, 
also there were gas chambers. 
 
Q: But you didn™t  know that? 
 

A: We  didn™t know that then.  My father perished
 in Majdanek; I didn™t know that then either.  
Because this was posthumously and after the wa
r. Anyway I cannot tell you all the details 
because I would be getting too emotional as to 
what has happened on this trip but we were 
lucky that we were only -- by that time -- si
nce what was comi ng was anticipated, about 
fourteen guys escaped from our camp. What wa
s left was about 88 me n because I reme mber 
when the Luftwaffe turned us over to the SS 
at the umschlagplatz, they said,________ they 
yelled.  So they said_______. There was 88, this is
 how I reme mber there were 88. We  lost one 

guy in the me lee in Majdanek but we saved some
 other people that were behind us and were 
sent to a camp na me d Budzyn. There was a mi
raculous saving, some thing happened in there 

that was just unbelievable.  I describe it in de
tail in my book and we were sent to Budzyn where 
there was an aircraft HeinkilAircraft plant, pr
obably the worst camp in the penal system as far 

as treatment went by one name d Fike s.  Reinhol
d Fikes was the commandi ng officer in the rank 
of a sergeant and he was an incarnation of cruelty
 and bestiality in what he dd.  In that camp, I 
stayed about eleven months. This camp eventually became -- was an SS labor camp Œbecame  a 

concentration camp. The difference being that they 
put us in striped uniforms.  Be fore we were 
wearing our civilian clothes. This
 was a time  where I registered 
as a chemist, as an inventor 
and later on this resulted me  working on this 
super- weapon development which didn™t turn out 
anything but it was a good vehicle 
to ride out the rema ining mont
hs of the war.  From t hat 
camp, we were sent  to a camp called Plaszow near 
Cracow.  From Plaszow, we were shipped to 
Flossenburg.  In Flossenburg, this group was real
ly commissioned so to speak, really put to 
work in what was reputed to be a super weapon.  

 
Q: Is this the same  group of 88. 

 

A: No, no. The  88 had nothi ng to do with it. Therewas a registry because we  were sent  to Budzyn 
---. 
 

Q: This is when you became  a chemist?  You were in another gr oup? 

 

A: There was another group because the camp had over 2,000 pe ople in Budz yn. This group was 
only ma ybe 50, 60 people large and it was an ag
gregate of people from di fferent camps.  
Budzyn had a contingent in it; Plaszow picked up 
a few people.  But eventually we were being 
set up in a sort of lab to work i
n, in Flossenburg. That™s  where the 
real work went in.  It was an 
unbelieva ble experience because I learned Englis
h working in this lab. There was nothi ng 
really for me to do.  I found an English text
book and David Copperfield and I learned English, 
found a tutor as well,
 among the prisoners. 
 

Q: A Jewish inma te? 

 

A: Ye s, name d Goldfarb who was teaching me  gr
amma r.  But there was a group of prisoners who 
was actually working on plans for this device, as
 the Germans called apparatus. There were 
some  rumor s as to what it could do if it were succe
ssful in doing it.  It fe
ll into the realm of the 
semi -fantastic.  I spoke once to my uncle who was a chemist, about it, and he says that what 

they propose to do could not be achieved.  It 
was unobtainable but they thought it was. The 
Germans we re not fools; they apparently were 
convinced that some thing could be done. This 
project was not such a local th
ing. We  didn™t know about it at the time  but it claime d the 
interest of the highest echelon 
of Nazi power.  I have a telegr
am that came after my book went 
to print, which is addressed to Himml e r to 
grant permission to move this group, which is 
essential to the war effort, this is German™s wr
iting, a Jewish group essential to the war effort .  
Do you see the paradox in this?   If
 we help them win the war, th
ey™re going to exterminate all 
the Jews. To the war effort and I have a reply from Hi mmler ™s office, from Hi mmler ™s 

headquarters, that he grants permission and that
 the ma tter should be take
n up with so-and-so to 
transfer the Jews, the scientists.  So we™re worki
ng there.  Eventually, when this project did not 
produce a mousetrap, it was disbanded and it was ju
st a few weeks later that theAllies armi es 
were already close to Flossenburg.  I don™t know 
how close they were because I was on a death 
ma rch for about three, close to four days
. We  we re liberated inApril by the 11
th
 Armored 
Division and of course, then I realized what ha
ppened to the other me mb ers of my fa mily.  I 
knew already in theWarsaw Ghetto, from my 
Uncle Melek, whom I found after I came from 
The Orcencia; I met him after the Orcencia pl ace, I 
was in his apartment.  He told me that Uncle 
Ben is hiding on theAryan side of theWa rsaw
 Ghetto and that Rose, his wife, hasAryan 
papers, works for German industry.  She hides hi
m in her apartment.  I found out that possibly 
that my Unc l e Sevek, the orphan --cousin who li
ved -- one of the three orphans brought up in 
my grandparents™ home, is also some  place in 
hidi ng but he didn™t know where.  He didn™t know 
whether he is still in hiding or
 whether he perished.  But beyond 
that all contact was lost and I 
have not learned of any details of any of my 
relatives except that I found out that my father, 
through_______Tr acing Bureau, they send me  this 
document that I showed you just when you 
first came in -- that attested to the fact that my father lost his life in Majdanek on September 23, 

1942.  So my mother died inTr eblinka in th
e first action, 1942, probabl
y inAugust with my 
brother Meir.  Now the only person that I don™t ha
ve a definite proof that was killed is my 
brother Szymon, to this day.  Because all ot her 
pe rished.  My grandmother, who saved herself 

from the first round-up in 1942, was probably shi
pped out in 1943 if she didn™t perish sooner, 
with her daughters, my aunts and with thes
e two boys of the eldest daughter, Frania. 
 
Q: So your brother Szymon, the la
st we saw of hi m, he went back to the ghetto because he  was 
homesick? 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: And he was staying with your mother? 

 

A: With the fa mily, at home.  Now --. 

 

Q: But he didn™t go with your mo
ther and the other brother?   
 

A: No, he didn™t go with my  mother. This much I 
have learned. Also I have learned -- of course 
after liberation I have received, 
I have overheard conversation be
tween liberated prisoners like 
myself, that there was aTopas in Prague, in 
Czechoslovakia, in Roxy Hotel where refugees 
converged.  I imme diately  -- I was at that time 
with the United St atesArmy; I was in the CIC 
corp, Counter intelligence Corp.  
I was one of the most fortunate 
of prisoners that I was allowed 
still to fight.  I was with
 the 104th regime nt of the 26
th
 division with theThirdArmy. After the 
war, I was attached to a CIC unit in Nuremb
erg, in the town that you me ntioned before, 
stationed in Nuremberg.  I found out that my unc
le survived; Uncle Ben survived and I also 
later on found out that he fought in the Polish 
uprising of 1944.  ButAndros was shipped with 
the Polish pe ople to Germany because allWa rsaw was emptied out of people. They were sent 

either to concentration camps or forc ed labor.  
He was sent to far m work.  He rema ined on the 
ruins ofWa rsaw and lived from what  he -- like 
a scavenger.  I sent some body, a friend of mi ne 
who also figures prominently in my book, to br ing him.  He brought him -- he went to the 

Russian zone and brought my Uncle Ben and we ha
d a reunion and we me t. Then I  sent another 
prisoner to br ing his wife from the British zone. 
 I found out that she was in Castle because my 
grandmother ™s letter told me  this
 after I resume d contact with her. She sent me  food packages 
and money a nd so forth 
 

Q: So your Uncle ma naged to survive mi dst the ruins ofWa rsaw until Ja nuary ™45 and then he was 
liberated by the Russians and then at the end of the war --? 
 

A: He went to Czechoslovakia. 

 

Q: He went to Czechoslova
kia and you saw him aga i n? 
 

A: Right.  He was searching relatives.  He want
ed to get possible --.  I don™t know what he 
intended to do but he found out ---. 
Then he told me  about Sevek, th
at he also survived and that 
he went to Israel, he and his wife, Rita. They 
were childless and he was already by that time , in 

his forties.  Sevek, the cousin. 
 

Q: He survived in the ghetto, inWarsaw? 

 

A: No.  He went into hiding. Th
ere™s an interesting story.  He used to work for our company. All 
the orphans, the three orphans worked for our company but he ma rried one of the pretty 

salesgirls from our company.  He separated hi
mself from us and he opened his own store of 

custom made shoes, a smaller --. 
 
Q: This was a non-Jewish wife? 

 

A: No, no, a Jewish wife, a salesgirl, right.  Her name was Rita, a very attractive girl. They 
established themselves a few streets away from us
, with a shoe store. Whe n the war broke out, 
he gave all of the goods to one of the Polish-- hi
s Polish salesgirls. That
 Polish salesgirl took it 
to her own home  and she would be selling, period
ically, some of the le
ather or leather goods 
and bringing them mone y to liv
e on, to the ghetto.  She would be
 going back and forth.  But 
later on, established thro
ugh her contact, they established a liaison with one of the Polish 
underground operators from the Socialist Part
y who were mor e  friendly towards Œ well--
disposed to the Jews --. 
 

Q: The People™s Guard?  

 

A: Whatever.  But it was not so altrui stic. What
 ha ppened is this; that he had in a place called 
Ramburtoof, I believe.  I™m not absolutely cert
ain because it had two name s in Polish names of 
the town that sound the same . When I went to 
visit Poland I was search
ing for the people that 
hid him in the wrong town because of the similarity
 of name s.  He had his wife living there -- it 
was like a suburban town ofWa rsaw and a daughte
r and son which were al
ready in their late 
teens.  But he also had a lover inWa rsaw wher
e he worked so he couldn™t support two of them.  
By getting my uncle Sevek, my cousin Sevek and hi
s wife to hide, he got income  for them so 
they didn™t have to depend on my pay.  He c
ould live with his love
r and they supplied the 
income for his wife and kids, for the two childre
n.  He was in hiding there until liber ated by the 
Russians.  He was there for seventeen months 
living mainly under the 
floorboards of their 
bedroom or whatever. 
 

Q: So his liberation also was 
in January of ‚45 or earlier? 
 

A: Evenearlier. 

 

Q: Because he™s on the other side of the river? 

 

A: Right, he was on the east side of the river. 

 

Q: So we know that much about the town.   It was to the east? 

 

A: Right. And some thing about Sevek.  He was 
a very friendly guy. When I was growing up, I 
was a kid., he was already almost 20 years old.  
He  had a way with the kids, always a smile on 
his face. You were never told that he had a 
hard life, that he was an orphan; he was not 
embittered by it and he di dn™t have any chip on hi s 
shoulder.  He would spend a lot of time  with 
the kids and play around, clown to
 entertain us, and so forth.  I was very happy to hear that he 
survived. Then, of course, I visited him to find 
out how he survived. That™s  why I™m able to 
tell you that.  He went to Israel; now he™s in 
Germany, really.  Because his wife couldn™t find 
work in Israel and there were ha
rdships at the beginning. They went
 to Israel when it was still 
Palestine, before Independence. 
 

Q: So he settled in Israel? 

 

A: He was settled there; he was there ma ybe for two 
or three years. Then his wife wanted to go to 
France to find a job for him and for her and she c
ouldn™t.  She couldn™t get permission to reside 
there so she went to Germany, un
fortunate. This is where he is 
today.  He is already 83 years 
old.  Now about my brother Szymon.  In 1989, my
 wife, in company of my wife, my friend 
Mark, his wife, Bea, and their two sons, we emba
rk on a trip of me mory l a ne. To go back to 
Poland after 50 years absence and to Israel on 
our way back and Germany.  I also stop in 
Germany.  
 
Q: To see --? 

 

A: To see Flossenburg -- and Sevek. We  went together to visit Flossenburg.  Now when we visit 
Poland, we realize that we are going to be there 
only six days or seven days.  Our time was of 
essence there, so we preplanned exac tly what we are going to ---.  
 (End of SideA,Ta pe 11) 

 We  arranged for two chauffeurs and two limos, two cars to take us around so we don™t depend 
on the regular tourist conveyance top see the pl aces
.  Because  there were specific pl aces that the 
itinerar y for our visit to Poland was planned in 
advance and it was very co mpact. We  had to 
crowd many things into a very short space -- so
 that when we arrive d inWa rsaw, we had two 
limos already when we arrived at
 the airport to pick us up, to 
take us to the hotel and the 
following morning, we started our visit.  Of cour
se my visit included first of all the city of 
Wa rsaw itself, the ghetto monume nt, the site of
 our apartment building in theWa rsaw Ghetto, 
which building had been erased, had been dest
royed during the uprising 
or possibly after the 
uprising, perhaps in the Polish revolt which wa
s in 1944.  It included visits to my childhood 
place of Shaboruf where I -- to re
me mber the villa that be longed to my grandparent s, perhaps 
still does, where we spent summers in my childhood 
days. Then we went to Majdanek, we visit 
in the Lublin district.  I see also the city of 
Lublin which I had me mory because I knew a family 
there and a girl that perish
ed in Poland. Then we went to places of____________ that was of 
interest to my friend Mark. We  went, I think that 
this is what we did in the course of time . We  
still hadWarsaw, increments ofWarsaw that were
 to be seen, for instance, theWarsaw cemetery 
that we didn‚t have time.  I don™t know on whic
h day but I think on one day, perhaps it was 
Sunday, the following Sunday of our arriva l, that
 we decided to split because Mark had his own 
itinerar y with his car to see Radom and I wanted 
to see my mother ™s hometown of Plutz. We 
went to Plutz and we have seen what there was to see. The synagogue was destroyed but the 

buildings we re still there.  I seen my grandpa
rents™ home, apartment, which was very, very 
small and --.  
 

Q: The opposite of luxurious? 

 

A: Of what we were used to inWarsaw. After seeing all these pl aces and theVi stula River and 
whatever I could associate with th
e past, we went to see.. Then we had a very intelligent driver 
and driving back toWa r s aw I realized that in 
spite of our frugality in using time economi cally, 
in disposing of time, we were comi ng early.  I sa
id to myself, I looked at my watch and I think it 
was some thing like 4:30 p.m. and the days in late 
August were very long.  I 
said to the driver, I 
said, do we have time to see another place in th
e vicinity ofWarsaw?Which really was not on 
schedule.  But it suddenly occurred to me  that th
e last three summers, we  did not go to our villa 
in Shorboruf, but we went to Oralie a village 
called Oralie which was kind of a summer  resort 

and also a farming community.  I was there in 
the summer of ™37 and ™38 and my family was 
there also in the summer  of ™39.  Because in ™
38 in the mi ddle of the summer, I was sent to the 

agricultural school as you 
recall.  I said, it would be interest
ing to see because I would be able 

to see the very cottage where we stayed in.  I 
asked my wife a nd she consented and the driver 
said, by all means, he was gung-ho. We directed 
because it was in the vicinity ofWa rsaw, it 
would not take us more than ma ybe half an hour
 out of the way, counting both ways. We  had 
some di fficulty finding our way to the place, to
 recognize and so forth.  Finally, some  people 
told me which building it is that I probably was in that summer.  I came by that building with 

the car and I look at that buildi
ng and I say, no this is not the 
building, it doesn™t have veranda.  
We  turn around and went back to the beginning of
 the street of the village when one of the 
properties -- a woman, elderly lady to
ld us that this is the building. 
 I say this is 
not the building.  
She says this is the building.  I 
spoke to her in Polish.  She says 
this is the building, she insisted, 
persisted rather.  I said, where™
s the veranda?   She says it wa
s removed. That can confuse you. 
 

Q: So you were both right? 

 

A: I asked her and she took us there.
  It turned out to be she was 
a sister-in-law of the landlady of 
the building name d Leva ndofska.  Mr. Levandofsky 
was, of course, the landlord. Wh en I was 
there, she was a woma n in her twenties.  Now 
she was nearly 80 years old.  She was sitting 
there; it looked like a rocking 
chair in the house. The lady that brought us in said you have 
guests in here. The guests being my wife, the driver
 and mys e lf. We  ca me in, we looked at her, 
and I began to orient my self th
ere that this is the building in
 which we stayed. This was a 
building that -- there were three fami l i es in th
e summer that shared that
 building. I™m repeating 
some thing that you can find in my book but I can 
probably tell you this in 
a greater detail than 
you will find in my book.  I say Mrs. Levandofska; she di dn™t  know who I was but they knew 

that we are tourists and that 
we were probably fromAmerica 
and I spoke Polish.  Many Poles 
returned back to Poland.  I said to her, 
do you remember who l i ved in this -- who was 
vacationing here in the summer, who occupied th
is building in the summe r  of 1938, ™39?   She 
looked and just stared at me  w
ithout saying anything like gatheri
ng her thoughts.  Of course, I 
couldn™t figure what were her thoughts.  I we
nt one step further and I said, do you reme mber 
who was in this apartment?  Pointing to one of 
the doors.  She said Lasolta.  I said it was a 

Polish pilot, the family who lived there.  So sh
e says Lasolta.  She reme mb ered that name .  I 

pointed to another door and she 
me ntioned the other family. Then I didn™t say anything for a 
mome nt. Then I said, wa sn™t   a Jewish fa mily he
re also in this apartment here? Pointing to the 
last one.  She says, yes,Topas.  She said, Mr.Topas, very sympathetic ma n, and Mrs.Topas, 

very nice lady. And they had two children. The oldest wasYurik and the younger was Szymon, 

another baby too?   Oh yeah, Meirick. That™s  Me
ir.  She told them that my  father was very good 
to them.  He  brought gifts, shoes for the fa mily in
 addition to whatever th
ey paid for the rent.  
She volunteered a few things.  I said to her I 
was very pleased. We  took some  photographs.  I 
thought the audience was over and 
I already exchanged some  do
llars for Polish money which 
power of dollars was tremendous.  I was going to
 give her a few thousand of the Polish zloty 
which were not very much inAmerican money but 
I felt that I took her time
 and so forth.  I felt 
that I would do it just as a fr
iendly gesture.  But just about
 when I thought 
that the whole 
interview was over, she began to shake in her chai
r.  She says, Szymonik, such a well-built boy, 

a pleasant boy, didn™t look Jewish.  He came here
 fr om theWarsaw Ghetto in the summer of 
1942, I think.  He asked me  to save him, to shelter 
him, to hide him.  I wanted to do it, I really 

wanted to do it.  But we were afraid because 
the trains were going fromWa rsaw toTr eblinka on 
the track that was stopping in our Ourland durin
g the norma l rides and the Jews were jumping 
off the trains. There was a gendarme name d St ei
n who was looking for them here.  I was afraid 
that if I™m going to hide him, the neighbors w
ill snitch on me  and then we™re all going to be 

killed.  So I said to Szymonik, let my husband ta
ke you to the next village.  Maybe you can be a 
shepherd there to cows, that sort of thing.   Sz
ymon, my brother, at that
 time was about fourteen 

years old.  But he didn™t want to go.  He says
 he doesn™t know there anybody.  But, and she 
repeated it again.  He told me  that his gra
ndmother lives inAmerica, is inAmerica.  I 
imme diately presumed that he said that to ma ke
 her understand that if sh
e does this, if she takes 
the risk, that she would be rewarded for it, after 
the war.  I ask her, Mrs. Levandoska, then what 
happened?   Did he leave?   She 
said, well ma ybe he stayed here
 a day or two, a few da ys and 
then he left.  I said did you hear anything 
about him?   She said no.  I had right away a 
premonition that he must have perished not fa r from this point  because he came in and although 
he didn™t look Jewish, but he was a kid and he 
was scared. You realize 
that every Jew just by 
virtue of being Jewish, ha
d a price tag on his life. 
 

Q: And he was in an area where they were hunting for Jews? 

 

A: And a Polish peasant who turned in a Jew c ould get a bottle of vodka and two pounds of sugar 
and ma ybe a  hundred zlotys.  So there was a rewa r
d, just as there was punishme nt for hiding the 
Jews, there was a reward for turning them in.  
He mi ght have been turned in by Polish people; 

he mi ght have ma de it back to the ghetto.  I really don™t know. When she came to the end, she 

was very sad.  She realized that I™ma relative but she di
dn™t know who I was. 
 

Q: She still didn™t  know who you are? 

 

A: I told her that I™mYurik, th
at I survived the war.
  I joined theAmerican army, fought to the 
war ™s end, and came toAmerica.  My grandmother lived inAmerica at the time, until 1969, 

when she died here in Lakewood.  She™s buried in
 Lakewood.  But I still gave her the money.  
She didn™t want to accept the money. Why are 
you giving mo ney?   I didn™t save your brother, 
she said.  Oh well, you wanted to save him.  
The n it seemed like there was nothing more.  I was 
pretty -- right now I can speak a
bout it without being as shaken 
up as I was at the time when it 
happened and when I repeated it th
e first time or two,  but now it™
s in the book. Then I said -- I 
just thought for a mo ment -- I sa
id do you have any photographs of
 before the war?   So they 
brought in an album of photogr
aphs before the wa r.  I sc
anned through the photographs and 
seen the building, I seen Mr. Landofsky who, inci
dentally, was laying paralyzed from the waist 
down in bed next door in the room where we we
re talking.   I didn™t 
see anything.  I was hoping 
that ma ybe they photographed our family, which 
for me , would have been priceless but they 
didn™t have any. There were some  loose photogra
phs that were just bunched up in the bottom of 

-- the end of the album.  I went through th
ese photographs.  I f
ound a photograph ofAdolph 
Hitler.. 
 

Q: That tells you some thing? 

 

A: It was really confusing. 

 

Q: Wa s there any writing on it? 

 

A: No writing.  It was just like a post card, a pict
ure ofAdolph Hitler. The driver had seen this 
with me  and I just didn™t say anything about it.  
I just shut and closed 
the album and we left.  
When we get in the car, I was confused but I realized that  her husband mu st have been a Hitler 

sympathizer. That she might have,  I feel th
at she was an earnest person, an earnest woma n 
because she didn™t have to tell me
 anything.  She didn™t have to te
ll me  that he came back there 
to save her, that he came from theWa rsaw Ghetto
, had to risk his life and get out.  Came  to her 

and asked her to be kept in there . She didn™t have
 to volunteer any of tha
t; I didn™t ask her.  She 

did tell me this so she -- maybe 
she had good intentions.  She wanted to save him but ma ybe her 
husband was opposed to it.  He mi ght have been an admi rer of Hitler. 
 
Q: Or even if he weren™t, he could have opposed it for other reasons. 

 

A: They had reasons but what shall I say? 

 

Q: It™s hard to imagine a real Pole being an admi rer of Hitler. 

 

A: Well there was admi ration for ---.  Until Hitle
r turning on to Poland.There was a tremendous 
admi ration for Germany because of their policy towards the Je ws. 
 

Q: Considering what they were doing to Pola
nd, that would not have been very patriotic. 
 

A: Ye s, it would not be patriotic and perhaps it is to 
their credit, of the Poles, that they didn™t  have 
ma ny collaborators against their own people that we know of. They didn™t have ma ny 

collaborators towards their own people.  But 
ma ny among them were very vicious anti-Semites 
and we were talking about all these people. I 
didn™t  me ntion to you, the Rosenbaums who are in 
my book, a beautiful girl -- and her mother were hidden. They were in Lublin.  I me t them -- I 

got to know them during the war in Lublin when I was staying there.  My fa ther was there. You 

reme mber when I told you we met.  Later on I 
got a post card that she 
is hiding.  I told you I 
was still inWa rsaw Ghetto when they went into hiding on a fa rm by a fellow na me d 

St y________ in Sm________, Ko__________ in Poland.  It wa
s not until ma ybe five  years ago 
that a widow of the son of the owner, who told
 me  that both wome n wer e
 killed by people other 
than the Germans.  She didn™t say so but she says
 they were killed because
 of their possessions.  
They went out in the mi ddle of the night w
ith valises having their 
valuables with them, no 
doubt, and he says, you know that there was no shor
tage of vile people du
ring the war and they 
were shot and buried in the woods nearby. This is
 some thing I have to return to because I didn™t 
have a chance to visit Sm____________ where possibl
y the burial ground is. 
 I don™t think that 
the grave was marked.  But this is where they 
were shot and they were shot by Poles. My 

brother Szymon, is still an enigma even in sp
ite of any premonition I have . There was an 
interesting development that is almost anti-clim
atic to everything we are talking about.  My 
wife, first, and then my son visiting Israel we
nt to a cavern which is
 on the border of Lebanon 
and Israel. The cavern is a tour
ist attraction and they seen on
 the wall, the name  of Simon 
Topas.  It™s a SimonTopas spelled exactly, not 
with a ﬁzﬂ but with an ﬁsﬂ,Topas.  Silemonca 
Spain, fami l i aTopas, familia SimonTopas  Silem
onca Spain.  I have -- just as I talk to you I 
just thought -- why I™m not able to find anythi
ng about this family.  Because I™m asking for the 
telephone number of SimonTopas at the Silemo n
ca operator in Spain.  I wrote to the Red Cross 
and to the post office.  He said the fa mily of Si monTopas which means, if it were my brother, 

in the unlikel y event, it is not he
 who wrote this --scribbled that
 name-- but maybe his son or his 
daughter who ma rked this in order to look for 
someone. The name  could be -- the first name  

could be different. And if it was a daughter who was ma rried and took another family name .  I 

think, in Spain, it works in reverse, the me n assu
me  the wife™s -- the fami ly assume s the wife™s 
last name  
 

Q: Ye s, they use both. 

 

A: They use both.  So this is still an unresolved 
kink but it™s  very unlikel
y.  Once I got excited, I 
found in Israel, SzymonTopas, in a mi ssing persons
 bureau in Jerusalem.   I imme diately sent a 

telegram there and the guy was nice enough to se
nd me  a telegram back that he assume d the 
name Topas after comi ng from Russia to Israel. 
 
Q: Plus it would be inconceivable that 
he wouldn™t be looking for you, for others? 
 

A: That id true.  I am still going to check out the Silemonca, Spain Œ 

 

Q: You have to ? 

 

A: Yeah, I have to. This is because we are -- we
 have so little and we 
are hanging on to a straw.  
This is very, very weak indication but I™m sa
ying to myself, who would come , who would be 
interested in comi ng to Israel? 
Although non-Jews come  to Israel
 and all the tourists, Jewish 
and non-Jewi sh like to see all the 
tourist attractions.  Besides th
e religious aspect, there are non-
sectarians so to speak.  Ce rtainly a cavern is 
some thing that interests 
everybody.  Could be a 
Morano 
 

Q: No, I wouldn™t have expected you to be
 descendants of Sephardim from -- -. 
 

A: But we are. 

 

Q: You are?   From 1492? 

 

A: Ye s. According to a distant relative who 
married my grandmother a
nd comes fromWarsaw, a 
fe llow name d Max Muskowitz, told me  th
at our fa mily originates in Spain. 
 

Q: We re they expelled in 1492 or? 
 
A: Right. There was a choice the
n, to convert or be expelled. 
 

Q: In fact the annivers
ary was just celebrated. 
 

A: Ye s,500
th
 anniversary.  I was in Spain but this wa s 
before I knew about the ---.  I was with my 
wife in Spain but this wa s before I know a
bout the sign in the caver
n.  I have a photograph. 
 

Q: How did the fa mily get to Poland from Spain? 

 

A: I think that the Spanish Jews, when they 
moved out of Spain, there was such a treme ndous 
flood, that it was exile, that they were moving 
westward.  Some  of the m wound up in France, 
some  went as far as Germany, Italy.  Italy alr
eady had some  Jews from before that existed from 
the destruction of, even before the destruction of
 theTemple, was a very old community there.  
Then in the 1500™s, the Polish king, Kaz mir the 
Great, thought that the Jews would be good for 
the development of the country which was backward
 and invited the Jews to come .  Gave them 
their Œ they became King™s subjects living under
 his protection.  So the beginning was very, you 

mi ght say, idyllic but it didn™t continue very long. 
 

Q: We  have any further reflections on this experien
ce?  Your family was in the mi ddle of the worst 
part of the Holocaust,Wa rsaw in Poland.  So
me  survived, beginning with your grandmother, 
others --? 
 

A: She was lucky that she was sent -- in that sens
e she was lucky that she was sent toAmerica.  My 
uncle owes his survival in a ve ry plain sense to my aunt, to
 his wife Rose, who hid him.  
 
Q: All of you who survived, to some  extent, were helped by your grandmother? 

 

A: Ye s, to a very great extent, because  we couldn™t 
get as far as we did if it were not for her help. 
 

Q: You had the foresight, for whatever reasons, to
 send to your new career, temporary career to be 
sure, as a farmer? 
 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: I also noticed in your story, that it seemed
 that at several junctures your path took you to 
Lublin?   Not voluntarily every time  but ---? 
 

A: Ye s.  Lublin figures very prominently in my me mo
ry,  First of all, if this is not apparent in my 
book, I want you to know that Lublin Jewry was one
 of the most hospitable communities I have 

known. The y took such great care of the refug
ees and they were inundated with people during 
the blitz of 1939. When we came there from th
is agricultural school, we
 went to the synagogue 
and we were living there.  People were bringing 
us meals like regular meals. They took it as a 
responsibility on themselves. They did it with a 
very pleasant demeanor 
and very graciously.  
My father, when I met with my fa
ther, one of the fa mily offered us a place to stay.  So I didn™t 
have to sleep in the synagogue anymore on the hard
 bench.  I went and stayed with my father.  
Of course, the Rosenbaum family became like a fa
mily away from the family.  I did have a 
roma ntic notion about the girl that figures in
 the book, Gina, although prem
aturely probably, but 
definitely ---.  I idealized her because she was su
ch a pretty and smart girl and talented too.  She 
could play piano.  I taught her how to play ches
s and she right away, beat me . We  were  there 
during the war.  I was there probably 
from -- I knew her from September 12
th
, I think, the day 
that I came to Lublin until we left forWa rsaw. Then, of course, I was drawn back there under 

the pretext that I want to go to the Russian zone
 and my parents didn™t object.  I came  back to 

Lublin already under German occupation and 
I was again welcomed and hospitality was 
extended to me  by the Rosenbaums. Then, the ne
xt time  was  when I was being taken to this 
far m work. You reme mber, when I was a volunteer
, for the harvest, I also got to see Gina.  
Later on when I got fever, I got si ck, and came back to Lublin, I was shown again hospitality.  

They brought me , they really cared for me  and nursed me  there when I was very sick.  I got 

measles at seventeen, is no fun.  
It™s not fun at any time but not 
then.  But being a contagious 
sickness, they were very kind that
 they wanted to do this. At 
one time, my brother, when he 
came out to see me in those estates, he also
 stopped over there in Lublin and was shown 

hospitality there. Ve ry kind people and they al
l perished. The father 
died during the Lublin 
occupation days, probabl y from ill health but th
e mother and daughter, Gina, the girl that I 
knew, they were shot in cold blood. 
 

Q: An aisle of beauty in a harsh world. 

 

A: She was very rema rkable.  I had to really
 condense in the book, I 
couldn™t express all my 
sentiment and the feeling for them that was mu
ch greater.  I felt that sometimes you say more 
by understating it than if you were
 to try and pou
r it all out. 
 

Q: Believe me , it shows. 

 
A: It shows.  Because I felt that
 the intelligent reader will see; 
this will be like a soldier who goes 
into battle___________ what great things he did there.
  It is not so much 
that it would reflect on 
me  but it is not necessa ry to emphasize the qualities
 because they are -- you can easily conclude 
that these we re fine people and very dear to me
. As a ma tter of fact, 
I had a photograph of Gina 
and I think I had a photograph of her mother 
too, that I carried w
ith me all through my 
internme nt in Pilani and Ocencia and Budzyn. 
 But when we came to Majdanek, they took 
everything away from me. They took every vest
ige of your personal life so that when they 
dress you up in those striped uniforms and the 
wooden shoes, you didn™t ha
ve anything tangible 
which would connect you with the past except your me mory. 
 

Q: I knew you didn™t have a photo of her because I 
knew that if you did, she would be in the ID 
project. 
 

A: She would be a very good candidate.  I think 
that perhaps this is just  my suspicious mi nd 
perhaps  but I think that her beauty had so
me thing to do with her undoing.  Because I know 

some thing of the ma n who was the son of the 
owner who was already a married ma n only he 
stayed there; that something like this, especially
 a vulgar individual, that
 this would not escape 
his attention, that this mi ght have been the reas
on they were forced to run away from the farm. 
Whoever killed them were either
 the people that had some thing to
 do with the farm or some one 
tipped them off. 
 

Q: Poles in any case? 

 

A: Ye s, in that case, Poles. You know Poles we
re capable of ma ny admi ra
ble things on individual 
basis. There were some  exceptional cases like th
is salesgirl in Sevek™s store, this Loja.  Her 
name  is Loja and she did a rema rkable service to
 them because she, when they were already in 
hiding in this place calledTr __________ and I hope I 
got that right, she ha d to bring, every 
month money for ---. They couldn™t pay in adva
nce because  then they would take the money 
and their life would not be -- the life would not
 be safe.  I me an you cannot say in every case, 
but it happened ma ny times when the Jews came in and gave everything to the owners and then 

the owners gave them away anyway after they kept the money.  So here she was comi ng in 

every month to bring the money.  She was also
 going and buying produce for the family, for the 

whole family, vegetabl es because they did not want
 to arouse suspicion in the local st or e. They 
suddenly buy so much when they were buying much
 less without these people.  So they had to 
go some  distance away to another town, to 
a big town to buy the produce and food for  the 
household.  Hi story is a book in 
itself.  How they ma de the hi
ding place; he told me , for 
instance, that they had to saw the boards off th
e floor. They were on the ground floor and there 

was just a dugout beneath.  It was not deep enou
gh to really live there so they had to do two 
things. They had to saw and sawing ma kes noi
se. There were people living directly above 
them.  How would they do it?  The daughter of 
this woma n where they stayed played piano, 
perhaps the mother.  She played piano very 
loud piece while he was sawing the boards, loud 
piece. Then they had to find out how they were 
going to get rid of the sand that they di g up.  
This is always shown in those escape pictures wh
en they fantasize about it or they take it in 

their pants.  It had to go out with
 the garbage pail, had to go to the 
garbage.  I think they also -- 
he told me  some thing about coal being there wh
ere they used some  of that sand.They had a 
coal bin someplace that was accessible to them. 
At one time, the Germans came in to this 
apartment, officers and they requisitioned one room
. The room was next room where they were 
down in the bottom. They, my cousin Sevek, he re
garded this as an insurance that the Germans 

lived there.  No other German detach
ment will come and search the place. 
 
Q: They would be above suspicion?   

 

A: They would be above suspicion and they stay
ed there.  But it put 
great restraint on them 
because usually --.  He told me that during the 
wintertime, they would be sitting in a dugout but 

at night, they went to bed.  In other words, 
there was like one spare bed. The only people that 

knew that they existed there was 
the mother, the wife of the guy th
at arranged this, this is the 
fellow that was from the Polish underground with 
the Socialist party and he was working in a 
transportation departme nt inWa rsaw.  His wife
, the housekeeper and the 
daughter and the son.  
The son worked for the Germans in one of th
e warehouses and he was stealing. At one time 
they came and arrested him and he disappeared 
without a trace, took him toAuschwitz, ma ybe 
they killed him.  
 

Q: If they knew he was stea
ling certainly th
ey would ---? 
 

A: It was very stupid of him esp
ecially if since they had someone 
there. What if they star ted 
searching the house for stolen goods and they woul
d find the place?   Because they had it cut out 
and it was covered with a little ca
rpet rug and this is how they lived. Ve ry interesting the way 
they had to arrange; everything had to be t
hought out. All the time, during the daytime, he 
would standing by the wi ndow and looking out who 
is comi ng through the gate. Wh enever he 
seen Œ because this was not a single family dwelling, it was like a quadruplex and there were 

others living on the second floor, but he had to
 see who comes to the main entrance of the 
apartment. Always watching, if it wa s a stranger 
right away he and his wi fe had to go, get the 
underneath.  My uncle lived the same  way because 
he was in my aunt™s apartment but she had a 
dormer apartment so there was a false, there 
was a wall, and between the wall and a pitched 
roof.There was airspace. What they do, they cut out an opening and there was a mi rror that had 

four special attachme nt points.  Every time that
 he suspected, heard st
eps on the stairway or 
some thing, he had to jump into that -- behind th
at mi rror where they had a chair to sit on and 

just secure the mi rror and hope 
that nobody gets wise to it.  
 

Q: But inWa rsaw, this was not possible. Wa rsaw
 wa s infinitely more dangerous. Apparently the 
only time it was possible to hide was after the dest
ruction of the ghetto an
d after the defeat of 
the Polish rebellion, talking about your uncle. 
 

A: Ye s, he was involved in the revolution.  He cam
e out of hiding and he 
fought with them.  But 
after it was crushed and all the Polish people 
were shipped to concentration camps or labor 
camps,Wa rsaw was virtually emptied of people, th ere were people like my  uncle who lived like 

scavengers on the ruins of the --. Because after 
emptyingWa rsaw, Hitler gave orders to destroy 
Wa r s a w .  
 

Q: Raze the quarter? 

 

A: Right.  SoWa rsaw was a --they claime d it was 
something like 65%, all the buildings were then 
destroyed, or 60%. 
 

Q: No ma tter how resourceful a person had bee
n, they had hidden, they 
still would not have 
survived, given that type of ---? 
 

A: As long as they were deep
 underground, litera
lly underground. 
 
Q: There would be a food problem?  

 

A: A food problem. This is why -- he had to out
 --they were going usually at night because the 
place was completely abandoned.  Occasiona lly a patrol  would pass by, then they would hide.  

But he lived there from the end of the uprisi
ng which was probably, the uprising was inAugust-
--. 
 

Q: Beginning of October, it was over. 

 

A: It was over so from the be
ginning of October until January 
when the Russians crosse d the 
Vi stula River onto the west bank toWa rsaw, he le
d this kind of existence. This apparently 
caused his pr emature death because he died bein
g about 65 in California 
and he died of some  
kind of liver ailment which mi ght have been cau
sed by the garbage that he had to eat at one 
time. 
 

Q: If you had to tell of the worst me mo ry that
 you have, the worst experience that you had, what 
would it be?  InWa rsaw, in camps and so forth? 
 

A: My God, there were so ma ny.  Of c ourse, I wa
s flogged but this was not the worst. The worst 
experience happened in Majdanek, I think. Whe n 
we arrived there, we we re shipped from the 
Luftwa ffe camp, Canjan were taken to Majdanek 
and on this train ride 
we were debating what 
to do.  Most of us were young me n; there were
 a few fathers among the young me n that were 
with their sons in that group. We  we re fortuna
te that we were only 88 to a boxcar, where else 
there were about twice that number that they pack
ed in others.  Many people perished just from 
suffocation when they --. We  were debating 
what we should do, whethe
r we should break out.  

The train left  about, with our contingent, about
 noontime, perhaps shortly before noon and was 
just meandering through the various places as it 
was going. We  said like this, that if it is going 
to go inTr eblinka, we have nothing to lose. We  ar
e just going to have to escape.  I know that 
there were people there already working on the fl
oor0boards, trying to see if we could -- a novel 
way of escape trying to get out from the floor 
boards rather than the windows that were 
norma lly used. They worked at it.  I don™t think 
that they did get very 
far with this operation 
because within 15 or 20 mi nutes we found out that
 we are on a line to Lublin, notTr eblinka.  

We  felt that perhaps we are being taken to 
another labor camp.We  didn™t know that besides 
Auschwitz andTr eblinka that th
ere are so ma ny death camps, we didn™t know. We  didn™t  know, 
ma ybe we didn™t want to know. We  heard abou
t the camps, like Sobibor. Once this wa s found 
out, so the attitude  change d and the de spair that
 do mi nated the mood in the boxcar subsided and 
they say ma ybe we are going to the camp.  Pe
ople sort of tried to slide down because we 
couldn™t -- there was not enough room for everyone
 to sit or lie down 
but if everybody lean 
against everyone, some how, the body sort of, like sa
rdines, we were able to ma nage to be down 
where we could get some  rest.  Everybody got ve
ry thirsty because the boxcars, the sun beat on 
them and it was hot. There was a fellow there with
 a bottle of water,  He took out the bottle of 
water that he had the presence of mi nd to take w
ith him. We  had bread that we took with us, 
our rations, but we didn™t think of water, we did 
not think of that -- we didn™t  think of it, we 
didn™t anticipate that it 
would be needed here, a big bottle of 
water.  He was going to have some  
of the water with his son.  But when he looked 
at the faces of us all, he  says, no, no, my son, 

we™ll have to share this water.  Somehow
 a spoon was produced and everybody got a tablespoon 
of water. This is the way it went all around.  
But the mo ment, I think my mome nt of greater 

despair came at the end of the 
journey because I could say when
 I stood in Lublin before a 
firing squad, was this the worst mo ment?   No, becau
se it happened so quickly and it came  as a 
surprise.  Before we got scared enough, become  
numb. It was all over.  I was also, a gun was 
pointed at me in Lublin on a railroad station 
by a drunk, an SS officer. This ended up without 
me  being shot.  But here we™re traveling on this 
train and there™s time  on our hands and we were 
able to think. Then it got dark and darker. 
 Fi nally the train slowed down and it was already 
beyond, not quite so dark that you couldn™t see but
 it was already further along than the dust, 
the hour of twilight when you can still see things
 relatively well. The train -- there was also 
another incident.  During the ride on the trai
n, a Polish peasant stood when the train wa s very 
slowly moving after ma ny stops that it ma de to gi
ve priority to other trai
ns.  He seen our train 
and he crossed hims elf.  So I said why woul
d he do this unless we are a cargo assigned to 
extermination.  I say after all, going to a labor
 camp still leaves -- th
ere is room for hope. 
 (End ofTa pe 11.) 

 The move ment of the train, very slow move me
nt, when the train is --when they are moving 
sections of the train on the final te
rminal; ther e™s more literal ly, this
 is literally what terminal is 
the right word to use, the trai
n was moving very slowly. You ha
ve the descending darkness, you 
see that we are being pushed through a tall 
ma sonry wall.  It sudde
nly, it gave me  the 
foreboding that we are being brought into the exte
rmination point, because we were not given 
any rations for the trip; people were packed like sa
rdines.  If you want to get work out of slaves, 
you have to give them living room, you have to 
treat them with a modicum of satisfying the 
basic needs of subsistence to live
 on.  No water, nothing given for 
us to urinate or to tend to all 
other needs that are basic needs and suddenly th
is descending darkness an
d the train slowly --
the train -- like we were going 
through the gates of hell. 
 

Q: That™s exactly what I was imagining. 

 
A: And the train came to a stop. When the trai
n was traveling, we  coul
dn™t hear nothing because 
you just hear the noise of the railroad tracks a
nd the rails and the wind and so forth.  But when 
the train stopped, you could hear the screams of 
the wome n and children in other boxcars where 
they had wome n and children, where they were packed very heavily.  Because the heat was 

unbearable and they had no room to urinate, th
ey had no room for anything. There was crying 
and lamenting and it all suggested a premoniti
on of i mpending death by so me  means that we 
don™t know yet; whether it will be gas chambers or they have some thing else in store for us.  

Then on the platforms, which on the right and a 
platform on the left which separated us from 
the other section of the train, there we re big 
floodlights and there were
 guards that were 
standing on both sides. We re just ma ybe two or
 three guards. All of
 a sudden you hear the 
sound of a rolling door open and a ma n, stripped down 
to his trunks, runs out of this heat.  He 
just runs and the Germans, the German guards, 
they begin to hunt him like a rabbit.  He says, 
Ich_______, I have him!   He says_________, halt. This and so forth, then you hear two shots 

and you see this guy collapsing 
underneath one of those floodli
ghts.  By that time  the 
temperature must have dropped, 
this was in May, and you coul
d see like a steam comi ng out 
from his mo uth, the blood was running out of hi
s neck. He was laying there, a human being.  
All he wanted was a little air and he was shot for th
at. When I seen this, this scene itself was a -
-I seen people killed before by the Ge rmans.  I ha
ve seen them in theWa rsaw Ghetto but I have 
never seen this, when you put all these elementstogether, under such circumstances. Then the 

imme diate logical conclusion is 
that we are not comi ng into a
ny labor camp.  If you begin to 
add all these things and as the morning began 
to dawn, there was a rabbi in our boxcar. We  
have a prayer that is said befo
re death; it is called confession 
before death, people say it.  He 
began to say the confession and he had a younge
r brother, Hanok was his name . That guy 

began to cry that he is only twenty years ol
d. This crying and praying became  very unnerving 
to us although a ma n ha s a right to say what he
 wants before he dies. We  were still not 
convinced that this is the end 
of the line.  Nevertheless some body asked them that they should 
stop this sobbing business and all this, wait to
 see what happens in the morning.  In the 
morning, when they open the boxcars, there cam
e a Jewish crew that was working and the 
Germans and the dogs, the whole circus. They began to open the doors of the car and they 
begin to pile out the dead bodies from the boxcar
s.  Ours was the only boxcar that didn™t have 
any dead bodies but from all other cars, they we
re putting the bodies. The Jewish crew went in 
and they were putting the bodies by 
stacking them in pyres, one on top 
of the other in squares.  I 
seen young wome n, young me n, it was 
just a frightening sight when you see so much death 
around you. We  were bewildered 
-- there were two hand grenades
 laying on the bottom of our 
floor.  In other words, one of the -- some  of our
 men had hand grenades an
d they were prepared 
to ma ke a fi ght for it, if we escaped.  If we
 escaped and went to the woods, we would have 
some thing; I mean that was the intention.  I reme
mber when we e mpty the car, the SS men take 
a look in the car; they seen the 
hand grenades and they ignored it.
 This was the final indication 
that we are sl ated for death because  if we are 
not, they would certainly not allow some thing like 
this to go unpunished. They would want a guilty 
party and they would ma ke an execution; they 
would try to show how they deal with some thing like this. 
 

Q: You™re all guilty already? 

 

A: It doesn™t  matter because  we---. Then we were put
 in a, those that  survived the trip were put in 
a column five abreast. The column was standi
ng there and forming. Wh
ile they were for ming 
and we seen that the crew---. Another thing is
 the cleaning crew that was working ther e, the 
Jews who were part of the crew of this camp, th
ey wouldn™t speak to us.  If we ask them, where 
are we? Wh at is awaiting us? They didn™t 
say anything.  So you got
 the impression like you 
were on an operating table; you are in a hospita
l and you see the nurses in white aprons looking 
at you as though you were dead already. We  didn™
t know that they were not allowed to speak to 
us, we didn™t know that. Then the column bega
n to form and there we
re about a dozen of SS 
me n on each side of the column, guards with rifles
. They were going to escort us wherever we 
were going to go. We  be gin the procession, slowly
.  When I was walking, I was bewildered, 
what was happening there?   My thoughts were very
 incoherent , in a situat ion like this. The SS 
man that was on my left, that was next to me, I r
ecord this in the book, he said to me ,Ve ir albist 
du? , how old are you?   I said, Ich bin_______ I told
 him I was 18 years old.  He answered me  
I__________, I™m nineteen..  He says_________, it™s a pity th
at you have to die.  He said it to 
me, he meant it; he had no---.  That was Œ th
is is the way he felt apparently. We  were 
eventually separated from those that went to 
the gas chambers; but this mo me nt, these mo ments 
in my life, including this question and answer 
and the pile-up of bodies in the morning and a 
beautiful morning to be surrounded by death, this a
rrival; this is probably 
the worst that I had to 
face.  Because after that
 I became already immune to these --
 not immune but I began to realize 
that sooner or later they
™re going to get us. That there™s a ve
ry slim chance of survival.  So I 
was not going to get again -- I would not pani
c anymore in a situation that was awaiting. 
 

Q: You think the worst and then you 
survive, then it™s almost a bonus? 
 

A: We ll, for some  people who survived that partic
ular mo ment was not the 
best thing because they 
perished later and they just su
ffered more.  But this was such
 a terrifying thing, this whole 
thing, the arrival, the descendi
ng darkness, the crying of the wo
me n, the pitiful crying of the 
children, and then the killing of that
 ma n who just run for a breath of
 fresh air, the prayers of the 

rabbi who survived, he lives in Pittsburgh.  I me
t him in Israel one time  unexpectedly, and his 
brother survived. All these things are just te
rrifying more than anything else that I have 
experienced before or since. A
lthough I had ma ny close calls afte
r, I was with a flogged person; 
it didn™t affect me  as badly as this.  I™m not 
going to tell you how we got out of this situation 
because then nobody™s going to buy my book. 
 
Q: We  won™t go into that.  I was going to recall from
 another interview that 
I had, that there was an 
orchestra at  Majdanek, pe rhaps not at this point . 
 But it seems that was all that is lacking---. 
 

A: IthoughtAuschwitz 
had the orchestra. 
 

Q: An orchestra was atAuschwitz but apparently 
there was one also at Majdanek, perhaps at the 
labor camp.  But you™re talking about 1942. 
 

A: Forty-three. 

 

Q: Forty-threebutearly---? 

 

A: May12
th
 or May 13
th
. 
 

Q: But you don™t recall any orchestra at the camp? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: I don™t think it would have been 
at this point in the camp.  It 
would have been some where else, 
like a work area at the labor section. 
 

A: Could be because we were not, unbeknown to us, we
 were not in the camp proper. We  were in 
the entrance camp and the reason they had the guar
ds because they had to ma rch us yet through 
a street which I think is called Helms ka B________ b
ecause it leads to hell.That would take us 
to Majdanek and to the gas chambers. This was 
our fate.  I studied the records of it from a book 
that was written of Majdanek, by a Polish writer.  
It™s not translated into English yet.  I bought it 

in Poland when I was there.  It said in that
 period of time, there were no registrations, 
everybody was going -- especially fr om theWa
r s aw Ghetto -- everybody was going straight 
into the gas chambers. Actually I was twice in Ma
jdanek. At this time  when we we re sent to 
Budzyn and when we we re shipped to Budzyn en r
oute to Plaszow, we detoured in Majdanek so 
I was their guest again.  I omitted telling you -- it
 occurred to me  that
 I omitted telling you -- 
some thing about my unc le Meynek. As you know, we ca me  to Budzyn from this transport in 

second week of May. That would put it about Ma
y 13 or thereabout. When we arrived there, 
we found out that there was already one group ofWa rsaw survivors,Wa rsaw Ghetto uprising 

survivors who arrived there a week earlier.  
One of the survivors, I believe his name  was 
Kaufma nn, a young fellow my age, 
recognized me  and he s a id I 
got some thing to tell you about 
your Uncle Meynek.  He was in our transport 
with his wife, that would be Irka on the 
umschlagplatz after the crushing of theWarsaw
 Ghetto uprising, they were herded on the 
umschlagplatz into boxcars. While he was in th
e boxcar with his wife, he
 was trying to bribe a 
Ukrainian guard, either to let hi m go which seems 
very unlikely; it seeme d 
very unlikely that he 
would have asked him for it.  Or he mi ght have
 asked him for water because they we re selling 
water for some thing like 500 zlotys a glass if th
ey got the money.  However, the Ukrainian 
guard after taking the money, shot my uncle and 
his wife, Irka, pulled off his riding boots from 

his legs, feet, and this is how my unc le came 
to an end.  I believe he was born 1907, he would 
have -- this was in May of 1943, he would have 
been 36 years old. This is the story of our 
fa mily. We  had very few survivors. That w
ould be my Uncle Ben survived, myAunt Rose 
survived because she was onAryan papers and sh
e was able to hide he
r identity and the only 
other survivor was myse lf and my gr andmother who left Poland on the last 
ship that  reached the 
United St ates.  My father died in Majdan
ek, now we know, my mother and  my youngest 
brother, Meir atTr eblinka.  Szymon s till rema ins as enigma , as to what happened to him. 
 

Q: Still waiting or hoping for a mi racle? 

 

A: Yes, it™s hard to imagine that this late, we woul
d not have been able to 
establish contact.  Since 
even if he lived in Spain, he would know that mo
st survivors went either 
to Israel or the United 
St ates or Canada and he would have tried to e
xhaust these things. Ther
e were no enquiries for 
me .  
 

Q: And then there™s your book, too. 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: He would have read a book about that story. 

 

A: But you know what? All this brings me  to this
 understanding --that we, 
the Jewish people, are 
very old people. We  have survived rising and fa
lling civilizations. The 
Germans were trying to 
put an end to the Jewish people in a most barb
aric way in the annals of ma nkind. They didn™t 
succeed and I don™t think that any ruthless dictator
ship would, in the future, succeed. But they 
never stop trying.  Okay, I 
think that we had enough. 
 

Q: Okay, thank you very mu ch for sharing your stor
y and your history.  I hope
 that it will be of 
great value, not only for the pres
ent, but for the future generati
ons who study and recollection of 
the Holocaust.
