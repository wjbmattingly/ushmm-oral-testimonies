Q: Good morning, Chris. Welcome to Washington. 

 

A: Goodmorning,Joan. 

 

Q: Can you tell me  the name that you we re 
born with, and where and when you were born?  
 

A: 
I was born in Starachowice, Poland, March 5
th
, 1926. My Hebrew name  was Rachel. My 
given name  on the birth certificate reads Ro
zalia Laks. I also was known as Rozka or 
Rosha Laks, and during the war, when we 
were brought from the Auschwitz camp to 
Ravensbrück, I had decided that it would be eas
ier to survive with an assu me d Christian 
name , and due to the fact that no records 
have followed our departure from Auschwitz, 
when we we re on the death ma rch, once we arri
ved at the tabl e where they regist ered the 
new transports, we changed our names to a Chri
stian name  Œ last name  and first name in 
my case, the name  Gorska Œ I assume d the name  Krystyna for it to be a real Christian 

name . 
 

Q: So, you have ma ny na mes– 

 

A: Manyname s. 

 

Q: –in your life?  

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Can you tell us about your fa mily Œ your fa
ther, your m
other, what they were like, what 
they did, and then about you and your two sisters?
 
 

A: We were growing up in a small town, 
population about 35-40,000, and it was Œ I would 
say that the Jewish population amounted to ap
proxim
a tely ten percent, no more, due to 
the fact that there were larg
e factories in the city, in th
e town, which were governme nt Œ 
belonged to the governme nt, and the people who 
were employed in those factories Œ they 
were ma nufacturing ammunitions, and also 
they had foundries and iron ore mi nes Œ 
People who were employed in the factories were
 mostly Christian people, gentile people. 
Jews were involved in predominately business 
and they were artisans and craftsme n, and 

this was more or less the composition of th
e town. The town Œ the Jewish population in 

town was very well organized. We  had a lot of
 different organizations. And I as a child 
could only get more or less from the conve
rsation that I overheard at home, you know, 

about my pa rents being involved in the co
mmunity going to different me e tings. They 
were predominately involved with Zi onist
 organizations. They were not orthodox or 
religious people, but they were traditiona
l Jews. My parents had a kosher home  and I 
would say that we observed the ma in holidays.
 I don™t think that my
 father was going to 
synagogue every day. I know he didn™t. And as
 far as we were concerned, as youngsters, 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
2 
 
as soon as we  were old enough, we too joined
 Zionist youth groups because this was sort 
of saying the whole idea that ev
entually we will all ma
ke our way to Palestine. As far as 
my parents are concerned, they were very activ
e in the community Œ Mo
ther in particular, 
more so, because Father was a lot away 
from home. Father™s involvement in the 
community never was as involved as was my 
mot her™s. He was what they call Œ I don™t 

know the name , there is no equivalent 
in the English language Œ but it is 
Braka
(
. Wh at 
this Œ what he has Œ what he did, he was ev
aluating– How to say it? Actually he was an 
appraiser of large tracts of fo
rest because he was representi
ng a very large international 
companies that supplied timber to German co
mpa nies and British companies. They used 
the timber for support in mi nes. So, he was 
working for a company like this, and before 
the companies went into the negotiation of th
e purchase of the timber, they had to have 
an idea more or less of what Œ how ma ny trees they are, what it will yield, and so forth, 

because they had to pay tremendous amounts of 
money. So, my father™s job was to travel 
to the forests and, in mo st cases, with the as
sistant of the forester, they we nt into the 
woods and he was estimating, more or less,
 you know, how many trees there are on the 

tract, how thick they are, what the yield 
would be, and when he was comi ng home  from 
the trip, he used to sit and prepare specifi
cations, and on the basis of his specifications, 
the companies went into the negotiations fo
r the purchase. So, he wasn™t that much 
around because usually once he went away, it 
was like three to four, some times five 
weeks before he™d return home , and when he™d return home he used to sit, you know, for 

hours and hours and hours in his study pr
eparing, you know, the specifications. So, 
Mother was certainly in charge of the hous
ehold and the children and seeing to our 
comfort and overseeing our activities and e
ducation and she was a wonderful woma n, and 
really, as far as forming the character, 
it was Mother™s responsibility. And, to her, 
education was very, very important. So, outside
 of the fact that sh
e was very involved 
with community and the Zionist organizati
on, she for med the WI ZO in Starachowice. 
She was the first president in the WI ZO or
ganization. She was a me
mber of regional and 
the national Œ no, what™s the word I want
 to use? Œ she was a me mber of the 
regional–uh– 
 

Q: Office?  

 

A: –Office, and she also 
form
ed for young unm
a rried wo
me n, the young WIZO in town. 
So, every once in a while, you know, when I wa
nted to know a little bit more about my 
parents immediately after the wa
r, I used to turn to thos
e people who Œ the generation 
between my parents and my self that could tell me a little bit more
 about who my parents 
were. Because basically, you know, to a child 
a pa rent is a parent. You don™t think of 
them as individuals. You just think of them as
 parents, and they™re th
ere to take care of 
you and provide for you and ma ke you comfortabl
e whenever it™s necessary. So, with the 
conversation Œ in conversations with those pe
ople, I found out a lot 
about my parents and 
especially from wome n who were
 like eight, ten years olde
r then myself who were, you 
know, already teenagers or a little older who 
told me  how wonderful
 my mother was and 
how energetic she was and how inspiring sh
e was in, some  would say, in bringing the 
Zionist idea and inspiring pe
ople and so forth and so on.

Q: When you speak about your father being 
away, do you have any recollections of doing 
things with your father?  Going for walks with
 your father?
 Or  goi
ng on a picnic? Or is 
there some  particular kind of recollection?  
 

A: Well– 

 

Q: Other than his working so hard. 

 

A: No, Father was a disciplinar ian. He was the 
head of the fa
mily, a typical European head 
of
 the fa mily. He was a disciplinar ian a
nd a no-nonsense ma n. And he was outgoing and 
he was very nice, but still in
 all, you know, when he spent ti
me with us, I would say that, 
if you were to compare with present days, you 
would say it was more quality time rather 

than otherwise. And, Father was Œ had a beau
tiful singing voice. He was, he was born in 
Silesia, which at the time when he was born,it was German oc cupied part of Poland that 

was occupied by Germa ny. So, I would say at th
e turn of the century, 1900, that was, his 
Œ his world was Vienna, 1900. So, the musi
c, you know, by Strauss and Mahler and 
Lehár Œ that was his world. He loved music. 
He had a beautiful singing voice. So, when 
we get together, I reme mber how we used to Œ 
fi rst of all, the tast e for classical music I 
got from my father Œ and we have been lis
tening to his singing, 
and we sang along with 
him. I mean, even in German, because his education was a German education. So, he 

spoke more, as far as foreign languages, he 
used more Germa n then any other language. 
And so, he sang along with us, and he  was teach
ing us voices in order to sing in different 
voices so that we could sing in harmony. 
And, no ma tter where we went afterwards, 
when we we re in a crowd, they knew that th
e three of us could sing in harmony. So, we 
were always asked to sing any song, you know
, and because we have learned what it 
takes to sing in harmony, we could ourselves
, later on, adapt to cer
tain levels, whereby 
we could create, even though not knowing wh
ether we are doing it right or wrong, we 
could sing in harmony one way or another, 
you know, in different voices. So, this wa s 

very interesting. But, Fathe
r™s culture, basicall
y, the culture of e
xperience, was more 
German. As a ma tter of fact, he had a st
udy with a huge ma hogany desk, and behind the 
desk was like a secretary behind glass doors. 
He was a very neat ma n, very neat, very 

elegant gentleman. I™m s orry I 
don™t have the picture right 
now here. And, he used to 
have everything placed all or
derly including the huge German
 encyclopedia. I reme mber 
when I went to high school and I took German
 as  the second language, he used to say to 
me , ﬁIf you ever need to use the encyclopedi
a, you are welcome to it, but don™t bend the 
pages, and please ma ke sure that everything 
is placed back where it belongs.ﬂ So, you 
know, this is the kind of a person he was. He
 was a very orderly person with whom, you 
know, things had to be always right. But I re
ally developed a very 
close relationship with 
my father after we had been taken to camp, 
when we lost our mother, because it just 
happened so that we had been working togeth
er, and we had access to one another. It wa s 
the slave labor camp in Starachowice, where we
 were not separated all the time  and we 
could have meals together and so forth and so on.
 It was at that  time that I really realized 

what a caring and loving person he wa s, a
nd inasmuch as he didn™t have ma ybe the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
4 
 
patience when we were little to be  with 
us. This was the bonding sort of time when I 
really felt how i
mportant he wa
s in our lives, and how
 i mportant we were in his life. So, 
these are mo re or less, you know, the way I would think of my  parents. 
 
Q: Tell me  a little bit more about your mother
. Wa s  she very warm?  Wa s she not so neat, 
given that she had to take care of all of you?
 That she was a little
 different then your 
father?  Or was she–?
 
 

A: Mother was, I would say, the extreme opposit
e of my father. 
She wa
s Œ first of all, she 
was more of a people™s person. She loved to
 be with people. She was the person who 
organized all social events. She was the pe
rson who was entertaining. She was the person 
who welcomed everybody in the house, regardless of who they were. Poor, I reme mber 

days when the local people who were dest
itute were comi ng to my mother asking for 
assistance, not only Jews but gentiles. It is
 a family Œ there was a fa mily, I mean, nobody 
is alive anymore Œ a Christian family that came
 to settle in St arac
howice at the time when 
the revolution in Russia broke out. They used to
 live in Belarus, if I reme mber correctly, 
and they came  to our town. They happened to
 be living in the same  courtyard, you know, 
how Europeans cities where it wasn™t indi vidual home s, but it was like one house and 

there was a courtyard and in the courtyard 
were other houses and 
people lived all around. 
And, they were intelligent, very nice, w
onderful people, parents and four wome n who 
were more or less the age of my parents, a 
little younger. And Moth
er got to like them. 
And it was very difficult for them to get, some  would say, accustomed. to go to town and 

to ma ke a living and so forth and so on. So, Mo
ther has encouraged them to open a, like, 
a kinder care. I was three years ol d when I 
was already in that pre-nursery, nursery 
whatever you call it, with my sister, you know
, my older sister, and of course, Mother 
had seen to it that other Œ th
at friends of hers would send 
thei r children. So, it gave them 
imme diately a little bit, kind of
 a source of income in addition to the father who was, he 
was not a doctor, he was a me dic, that Mr. Pa
liszewski. He was working as a me dic in the 
Russian Army, I think, or whatever. He wa
s so knowledgeable about me dicine that 
eventually when the hospital 
opened in our town, he was an accredited pr actitioner in the 
hospital without being a doctor. So, this te
lls you some thing, but you know it takes time  
for any newcomer. So, my mother was doi
ng all these things, and by the way, the 
Paliszewski fa mily the most wonderful family
 to us. I mean, for us, they were a home  
away from home all the time. And I™ m skipping 
things, but I must tell you that after the 
war, when I came back to my home  town, if 
it wasn™t for them, I would have been killed 
the day I arrived back. But this is another 
story. So, I cherished the friendship that my 
parents had with the Paliszew
ski family. So, here we are,
 we were talking about my 
mother, what she was doing. So, she was trying 
to assist destitute 
people. She was trying 
to help people who were comi ng to the comm
unity to kind of get settled and start a new 
life. She was, during the war Œ she was instru
me ntal in creating the Hebrew school to 
which we went, a Hebrew Day School. My firs
t four years of for mal schooling were not 
in the public school system, but they were in
 the Hebrew schools, 
in the Hebrew school. 
Everything in that school was in Hebrew Œ 
ma th, geography Œ everything they taught us 
was in Hebrew. I mean, we were learning 
Polish as well, but Polish was a language Œ 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
5 
 
Polish history and Polish was taught in Polis
h. Everything else was taught in Hebrew. 
Now, I want you to know that in our ho
me
, we never spoke Yiddish, which was a 
language that was used in everybody™s house.
 My parents both were educated. They 
spoke four languages fluently Œ Polish, and German, and Russian, because Father was 
educated in German schools, Mother was e
ducated in Russian schools, and Yiddish, of 
course, they spoke fluently. Some ti mes they s
poke Yiddish so that if
 they wanted to say 
some thing we shouldn™t understand. Mother come
s from a family that was, I would say, 
very educated due to the fact that even 
my grandma, I re me mber Grandma Sara, had a 
high school diploma, and I want you to know
 that in those days, nobody considered an 
education for a woma n necessary. She had 
thirteen children, mi
nd you. Nine survived; 
four died either in childbirth or whatever 
it was. That was Œ she ma rried Œ she come s 
from a fa mi l y of bankers, Fefers, from Ostoriwiec and she married a ma n who was come  

from Sandomi erz. He was in the printing business.
 So, again, in order to be in the printing 
business, you had to be very literate, b
ecause ot he rwise you could not run a successful 

printing business. That wa s my mother™s side 
of the fa mily. All my  
aunts are Œ graduated 
from high school. The youngest one went to 
the university and she became  a phar macist, 

and she worked, I think it was the year be
fore the war; it was her first year of 
employme nt . She was the youngest, you know, and th
at was her first year of e mployment 
and she was some where near Bialystok, and we
 never found out what happened to her. 
We thought that ma ybe, because she was so clos
e to the territory that it wa s eventually 
occupied by the Russians Œ you know, in 1939, 
when Poland was divided between the 
German occ upants and the Russian occupants Œ 
but we couldn™t find her. So, out of the 
fa mily of nine on my mother™s side, there was 
a set of three si ster s, fi rst. They all had 
children. My mother is the last one from the fi
rst set of three girls.
 They have children 
who have married with children already. Like 
my oldest aunt had tw
o sons who had been 
ma rried before the war, and they already had 
little babies. One of them had two, and one 
of them had one, while the youngest sister was 
just graduated from the university. And in 
the mi ddle were three brothers who at the tim
e of the Russian revolution ma de their way 
to the United States and Cana
da. So, there were the first three wome n in the fa mily, then 
there were the three me n in the family, and th
ere were the three youngest
 girls, sisters of 
my mother™s, in the family, who were still 
single. One of the m got ma rried right Œ I 
would say during the war, ma ybe in 1940s, 
and I don™t reme mber whether she had a 
fa mily or not. I just can™t reca
ll that, and this is it. So, I wa
s very fortunate to have some  
me mbers of my mother™s fa mily here in the Un
ited States and in Ca
nada that, at least, 
you know, ma kes you feel good that there is
 some body around who can tell you who you 
are, when you were, and what was life lik
e for them when they were around. Another 
interesting thing about my pare
nts, if you want to know, is I me ntioned to you before that 
they were very instrume ntal, always trying 
to assist other people. I reme mber, you know, 
whoever, as I said before, whoever knocked 
on the door, they were always, always more 
than willing to help, but beggars came around, 
you know, they used to give me  like a coin 
and said, ﬁGo out and give it to them.ﬂ They were never asked to come  in. And there 

were ma ny people who were comi ng begging, y
ou know, in those days. But then in 1937 
maybe ™38, I was a little older, there was Œ I 
could see new faces that were comi ng in and 
they spoke German, and when my parents Œ my 
parents used to say that if they are not 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
6 
 
home and there is somebody who is comi ng 
in and doesn™t speak Polish but speaks 
German, be sure to ask them
 to come in. 
Those were the German Jews who were being 
so-called ﬁresettledﬂ from the German territ
ories. And they, when they were comi ng to 
the different communities in Poland, and they ju
st happened to be come  to our town, to 
Starachowice, due to the fact that Fath
er was, spoke German s o well and could 
communicate with them and understand their ne
eds and Mother was so being having all 
these contacts and connections being so, so to 
say, as they say in America, a Macher, you 
know, trying to be of assistance to others, 
that I could see, you 
know, how they really 
spent a lot of time in order to assist  them. 
And I didn™t understand th
at much at the time 
yet, but some body knocked on the door and they used to say in German ﬁ
Is Herr Laks zu 
Hause?
ﬂ And I used to run to mo m and say, ﬁMommy, a 
Deutsche Jude
 is there.ﬂ You 
know, I remember, I did it once and Mother said
, ﬁI don™t want you to talk like this.ﬂ If 
anybody™s asking about dad or about me , ope
n the door and ask them in. You know, you 
are a child, you don™t know what
 to do. You don™t know how to behave. So, what they 
did for the people, in what way they assisted
 them, I don™t know, but 
the me re fact that I 
had observed that those people 
were welcome in our home and 
that my parents cared to 
listen to them, I™m sure that they have 
done something to ma ke their life easier. 
 

Q: Were you wealthy? Wa s  the family 
wealthy or well off in som
e
 way?  
 

A: Well, let me  tell you about this aspect of the 
fami ly. From the pictures that I have seen in 
the albums, from
 the early childhood, I think th
at we were quite comfortable because the 
pictur es were from differ ent resorts, areas
 like the Baltic Sea, you know, and from the 
mountains, the Bezkidy, and there was a spa in
 Busko Zdroj that my
 mothe r  was going, 
and we always had either the ma id or a 
nanny that came along, you know, to take care of 
us. But at the time of the depression, when 
America, you know, after the crash and when 
Europe was attracted by the American depr
ession, which was 1933 or whatever, I don™t 
reme mber in Poland at the time, Father™s se
rvices were not needed anymore due to the 

fact that neither Germany nor England could afford to come  and purchase timber in 

Poland because they themselves, you know, they 
had to ma ke do with whatever they had, 
and utilize what they had. You know, it was a 
very, very difficult time . So, I reme mber 
Father was looking, I mean, he had to suppor
t the fa mily. He stopped going away from 
home and he was around home base. So, I reme
mber he had a job with the same  compa ny 
that he was representing before, but here, t
oo, he had to be channe
led into a different 
aspect of the operation of the lumber company, and there was only part-time work for  

him. So, he also assume d a kind of a half
, semi -position with a credit company because 
we lived in, as I said before, in an indus
trial area, and people were buying things on 
credit, you know. So, let™s say if somebody want
ed to buy an item which was expensive, 
and I™m not talking about thousands of zlotys, 
but whatever, but they needed a coat or a 
new suit, and whatever. You know, he couldn™t 
walk into the store and buy it. So, the 
ma n who wa s on the job in the factories, in the 
mu nitions factories, used to go to the store 
and establish a credit and he 
was paying so muc h a month, a  week, I have no idea. But 
Father was doing the research in order to gi
ve them the credit reference. So, that was 
another thing. But we were growing up and we 
had to go to school, and 
my older sister in 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
7 
 
particular was about ready for high school, 
and that was an expensive thing. So, my 
mother decided to learn a trad
e. W
e  had, I mean, things were difficult, so we subletted a 
room, and we subletted a room in our house 
to a woman who was a corset maker. And 
the woma n s a id to my mother, after she wa
s half a year in to
wn, she says, ﬁYou know 
what?  You ha ve such connections .ﬂ You know 
because she was trying 
to assist her, ﬁYou 
have such great connections, and I™m a single wo
ma n, and I don™t think I like to stay here 
for too long.ﬂ She says, ﬁWhy don™t you learn it
?  And why don™t you run a corset shop? ﬂ  
So, of course, Mother figured she™s there, so
 she mi ght as well learn. Mother didn™t know 
how to use a sewing ma c hine or anything like this. I reme mb er, in the beginning, she 
used to cry because the wheel was turning 
the other way around instead of forward. But 
she has learned and, of course, with all he
r connections in the community, you know, the 
non-Jewish and the Jewish population, she de
veloped a wonderful business. She was 
really, and you know she had the respect ofeverybody, and therefore,
 so you know that 
was another source of income  for us, which wa
s easier. And then in 1937, finally, Father 
got back on his feet, and he became a representa
tive of a wholesaler from abroad. I don™t 
know. One company I think was in Lithuania 
that was sending different cheeses, so it 
was importing different cheeses from Lithuani
a, and canned fish either from Denmar k or 
Holland, I don™t know. So, he had these two fr
anchises that kind of brought him back on 
his feet and things were l
ooking up, and we were growing 
up and ready for school and– 
 

Q: I want to ask you some  questions about your sisters, but I™m curious, when you all were 
singing, was there som
e
one playing the pian
o?  Was there a piano in the house?  
 

A: No, we didn™t have Œ yeah, it was always a 
capella. We
 never had a piano. As a ma tter of 
fact, you know, Mother had a very good voice, t
oo, but it was Father who really loved it, 
and as a ma tter of fact, my uncle from the 
United States who was the next  to follow my 
mother and, Uncle Moish, and in the fa mily 
of the nine children, they were the two 
closest siblings. So, when Uncle Moish, when 
I me t hi m, he always was telling me  how 
Uncle Moish played the banjo and sang. So, he
 used to tell me  how they used to get 
together  and they used to form like the 
little theater and perform for people in the 
community, you know, get together and they 
had other people, you 
know, who were like 
themselves kind of artistic and with good si
nging voices and everything. So, Uncle Moish 
was telling, filling me  on those little things
 that were at home as far as singing is 
concerned. So, they all had th
is, this musical ea
r. In our family, my son, who is 
resembling my dad very, very much, is the one who has a good voice. Miles has a terrible 

voice, and Jeanette is just lik
e him. They are always off-ke y. They love to sing, but they 
are always off-key. 
 

Q: And you still sing?  

 

A: I do sing, yes, but of course, it™s not Œ it™s no
t the sam
e
 voice. I used to have the voice of 
soprano, you know, and very high, and I reallysing very, very well without any particular 

voice training or anything like 
this, but I love to sing. I reme mber when we used to get 
together, always, the parents used to say, 
ﬁLet™s sing.ﬂ And all 
the pop songs and the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396

national songs and Hebrew songs, when we were
 traveling with the 
children in the United 
States on long trips, to kind of keep them 
busy, keep them
 occupied, so they wouldn™t 
fight with one another in the back seat, 
we used to engage them in singing, you know, 
and we had a very favorite Hebrew song, ﬁYalda
 Yafaﬂ, because you could also sing it in 
the harmony, you know, different ways, and I tho
ught that this is going to ma ke the m 
kind of involved, more involved than otherwise.
 So, they used to get very upset when 
Miles started because Miles ne ve
r, I mean he loved to sing, 
and he knew the song just as 
well. You know ﬁYalda Yafaﬂ, means a pretty 
girl in Hebrew, and they loved the song. 
We all loved the song, but if I started we c
ould continue to voca
lize and sing in harmony. 
When Miles started, no way. They still talk
 about it the trips, you know, to Canada, 
which took like 13, 14 hours before you got 
from Vineland to Toronto, about the long 
trips and how dad used to sing ﬁYalda Yafaﬂ 
 
Q: Tell us about your two sisters. You have 
an older sister and a younger sister. The younger 
sister is three years younger than you are. 
 

A: Close to four. 

 

Q: Close to four. 

 

A: I was born at the beginning of the year, 
and she was born at the end of the year. 
 

Q: So, you were born in 19
26, and Regina™s born in 1929. 
 
A: But, I was born in March, beginning of 
March, and she was born m
i
ddle of Dece mbe r . 
 
Q: And, the older sister, when was she born?  

 

A: She was born two years before me , i n January.  

 

Q: So, you™re all–
 You™re– We
ll–?  
 

Q: But it™s that difference in age, it was trem
endous, so to say, when you think in term
s of 
childhood, was between my oldest 
sister and my little sister. I used to adore my older 
sister. Whatever she did, nobody could do it as 
good as she did. She was my role model, 

and I would do anything for her, whether she to
ok advantage of it, I would say yes, like 
any other sibling. 
 

Q: Can you describe how she took advantage?  

 

A: Well, if she needed errands, you know, and 
if she didn™t want, she was too busy to do 
what she was supposed to do, like take care of
 uniform, you know. W
e  went to school in 
uniform regardless whether we were in 
elementary school or in high school. In 
elementary school, we used to wear like a 
smock, which was, we called it an apron, you 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396

know, with a little white collar, 
and for it to be fresh we used
 to change Œ like a Peter Pan 
around, kind of Œ for it to be nice and fresh 
we used to put everyday a fresh collar, you 
know, lots and lots of collar in
 a drawer that were alwayswashed and starched. It was a 
m
atter of pasting it to the coll
ar. My sister she wouldn™t do it
. She used to pin it, and it 
was always crooked. So, she used
 to have me  do those things
 for her. Like, she was too 
busy with home work and she was too busy with 
her so to say, involveme nt with school 
and she read books. She read constantly, cons
tantly. I mean, have developed a liking for 
books and for reading, especially classics, becau
se of her due to the 
fact that I was the 
younger one. She was the older one. So, of cour
se, I couldn™t read 
the same books at the 
same  ti me  as she did, but when she was co
mi ng home from high school and some of her 
friends came along for a visit, and they were
 sitting around and talking, discussing books, 
I used to be so envious that I didn™t know a
nything about it. So, of course, I was reaching 
out. How much I have gotten out of the read
ing at the time, like okay, let me  give you a 
book like 
Les Misérables
. I could understand that b
ecause it was about Œ from the 
historical point of view, Icould understand. The social nua
nces of the book, I don™t think 
that I understood then as much as I can unders
tand now. Now, if they were, let™s say, if 
they were discussing 
The Bauhaus
, Ibsen, it was beyond me . And, I took it, and I looked 
it, and I read it for the fact that  I want ed to
 get acquainted with it,
 but with how much I 
had gotten, I don™t remember. I still read 
Anna Karenina
 and Tolstoy, you know, and 
some of it I have gotten. When
 I sat and listened to the conv
ersations, it kind of ma de a 
little more sense. My problem was that I di
d not read the book befo
re the discussions. I 
had read the book after the discussions. So, th
erefore, I could only apply just so much 

what I overheard and no more. I me a n, and don™t 
forget that it™s not like right now, I 
would open a book and it would be quite clea
r to me , you know?  Basically those days 
were Œ what interested me  was the story a
nd the people involved a
nd the plot. But, in 
between the lines, how much I have 
seen there, I don™t think I did.  
 

Q: Would she talk about books with
 you?
 W
a s she patient with you?  
 

A: No. No. She  only had friends– She wasn™t Œ you see, when she was ready to go to high 
school, there was no high school in our town. So, she had to go out of town to a larger 

city, to Radom.
 There were private schools in 
Radom, and there was li
ke a federal school 
in Radom. That was the Gymnasium Chalubi nskiego was the number one school in 

Radom. And in order to get into that school
, you had to be a very excellent student. So, 
when she came  Œ and they were accepting I 
don™t reme mber  25 or 30 students annually Œ 
the school was predominately for local peopl
e from the city, and it was a non-Jewish 
school. So, the number of Jews was limited. 
You had to go through an exam, entrance 
exam, regardless of how good a student you were, you still had to have an entrance exam, 

entry exam? Whatever. So, when Mother br
ought her for the exam in Radom, Mother 
was nervous, not my sister, because Mother 
knew that she™s not going to pass it. Not only 
being from out of town, but being Jewish, th
ere is no place where she can take her. So, 
that was like in June, early June and the results we re like– 
 

Q: What year was that? 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
10 
 
 
A: 1937, no 1935. She six grades of elementa
ry school Œ some
where around there. So, 
Mother took her for the exam, and a few week
s later were the results, and the school wa s 
closed already, so what they had is they 
had like a blackboard on which they posted all 
the people who had been accepted, not alphabe tica
lly, but on the basis of how they scored 
in the exam, and my sister was number five, and accepted. Do you realize that 

achieveme nt?  Now, that was very difficult ti
me s for us. That was the time  when Œ she 
must have gone in 1935 because I was in hi
gh school already in ™37. Whe n she went to 

school, financially, my parents weren™t doing 
so well, and tuition was expensive. Not 
only that she was accepted to school, but 
she received a scholarship, a 50 pe rcent 
reduction in tuition. So, she was really brilliant
, and I love her, she™s so special, she™s so 
special. She™s having health problems  now, 
unfortunately, and she lost her husband. So, 
it™s difficult for her, very, very difficult. Bu
t, she™s a very special person, and I always 
tried to emulate her, always. I mean, she st
ood there and she wa s reciting poetry. I mean, 
she was, she was just a very unusual girl. As I told you, she was my role model. I was Œ if 

I thought of myself trying to do whatever, wh
atever she did, I always thought that I™m a 
klutz, I don™t come  near her. 
 

Q: And your younger sister? We re you to your younge
r sister what your ol
der sister was to 
you?
 
 

A: No. No, different, because I didn™t want to have anything to do with my little sist er, not 
even use her for anything. She was too young. 
You know, there was Œ here it was like the 
difference in age was two years. There, it
™s almo
st four, and you know, we were little 
kids, and she kind of Œ I felt that she belongs 
with the sissies. I wanted to be what my 
other sister was. So, we kind of treated her 
like the baby in the fa mily, you know. To play 
with her, play game s and do things, you know, 
whenever she wants. She always had such 
a curiosity for things. Re nia was an unbelieva
ble person. Wh en it came  to learning about 
any little thing, nothing mi ssed he
r ear or eye. And also the one thing about Renia was, 
when she heard a new expression, she put it to
 use imme diately. We  used to laugh at her 
because some times she couldn™t sa y it properly. So, she used the word, but it was kind of, 

the word that she wanted to use, she ki
nd of changed it around. I don™t mean by changing 
it around, it™s like, let™s say, a child would 
say instead of a napkin, they would say 
ﬁnapikﬂ or  whatever, you know, this kind of a 
thing. They will leave out one syllable or 

whatever because, you know, it™s either difficult 
for them to say it, or  is it because they 
didn™t hear the exact thing. But every word that
 wa s new to her, she used it imme diately. 
What was the word that we used to ma ke so
 mu ch fun of he r?  I can™t reme mber right 
now. It may come back to me. It was a Œ it ha
d to do with intellect , 
and the way she used 
it was very, very funny. I just don™t reme mb
er right now. I should™ve asked her.  
 

Q: You describe, and when you talk about ever
ybody, there™s a kind of 
security about your 
household and your fa
mily for you. Is that 
accurate, that sense that you w
e re very 
grounded in a fa mily that supported you and–?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396

A: We were a very close-knit family. Even as
 much as Father was away, but when he was 
around, as I said, he was a typical head of 
the fa
mily. He cared, he provided for the 
fa mily, he did things with the family. But I 
would say that now that I am a parent and I 
am a grandparent and I can observe how people be
have at certain stages
 in their life, that 
I can see that with the excep
tion of the present generation, 
where both parents are on jobs 
and are away from home, where both parents 
are involved in the ac
tual running of the 
household. In the olden days, the father was not
 too involved with th
e children. Maybe if 
we had boys in the family, it would have been different. I don™t know. I don™t know. I 
ma y be wrong. I ma y be  right. You know, ma ybe
 there would be a different tie. As a 
ma tter of a fact, I didn™t me ntion it to you, but
 my  parents had four children. The first 
born was a boy, and he was a very bright boy. 
He was four years old when my father 
went on a trip to the East, I mean to Œ you know, for the job, how you say on his duties 

on the job, and he took sick, and Mother recei
ved a telegram that Father was sick and 
he™s in the hospital. So, she left  the maid w
ith the baby and she told the maid to take the 

baby, get on the train and go to my gra
ndmother™s Œ Grandmother lived only 30 
kilome ters away. So, the ma id Œ it wa s wint
ertime and the ma id dressed the baby up and 
whatever and it was hot on the train and co
ld outside. What happened, I don™t know, but 
the baby got pneumonia and a week later my mo
ther got a telegram to come i mmediately 
back from my grandma, and by the time she got
 back the baby was dead. He was the first 
born who before even my oldest sister wa
s born. So, I could reme mber seeing in my 
mother™s purse either  fr esh grass or  wilted 
gr ass which must have been fro m the grave 
every time  she went to the cemetery, but she alwa
ys used to carry a li
ttle bit of something 
in her purse. His name  was Juziu, Jusef wa
s his name . So, now you are asking me  about 
closeness with Father. I don™t know. Re ma rkable
, another thing that™s
 rather rema rkable 
is that Mother used to say to us when we 
asked her about him Œ we were children so we 
were curious because there was a picture of 
a little boy, very pretty boy Œ I™m so sorry 
that I don™t have a picture of hi
m. Li ttle sailor collar, little
 white shirt and all that. And 
she used to tell us and then she says that 
during the First World Wa
r I think he was born. 
No, if my si ster was born in ™24, he must ha
ve died in ™23 or ™22. It was still wartime. 
And Mother was with him on a train and he wa
s asking all kinds of questions. He saw the 
people in uniform and the buttons and the hats 
and all that, and she used to Œ he used to 
ask all the questions, and there was a woma n 
sitting on the opposite 
of my mother and 
she looked at the little boy a
nd she says to my mo ther, ﬁT
hat boy™s not going to live too 
long. He™s too smart.ﬂ And, you know, Mother repeat
ed to us when we were a little older 
and we started to ask more and more questions. 
It must have been tr
agic for her. I mean, 
she didn™t want to dwell on it, I™m sure, becau
se she had the responsibility to her family 
and it was a very Œ it mu st have been a ve
ry painful and sad experience for her to go 
through with this. So, this is the answer. 
You know, God giveth and God taketh away, 
and you never know when. 
 

Q: Well, why don™t we take a break now?  

 

A: Okay.

Q: Chris, do you reme mber the first time you ev
er heard anything about the Nazis?
 Wa s it 
before 1939, before the war?  Did you know 
anything politically 
that was going on?  
 

A: The only Œ the fi rst time really that  that
 I was aware of some
thing happening was when 
the German Jews were arriving, and when they came  to our town and, as they were 

comi ng every once in a while to our house to vi
sit with my parents, who were trying to 

assist them. So, the reference that I had ma de 
before as to alwa ys referring to the people 
as the 
Deutsche Juden
, because in the community the Jews of the community used to 

refer to the newcomers, to the new Jews from Germany, as the 
Deutsche Juden
, to 
distinguish between the local 
Jewish population and the Jews 
that were comi ng to town. 
And, of course, their plight which was kind of
 obvious because I could see the extent of 
my parents™ involveme nt, but
 at the same  ti me , this was happening in Germany and 
Germany, in the mi nd of the young person, is ve
ry far away. So, there is no imme diate 
danger inasmuch as to my parents, I™m sure 
that they could see the whole picture in a 
different way. To us, we were st
ill at home , we were still at 
school, we were secure in our 
environment, and therefore, we didn™t pa
y much a ttention, and it has never been 
discussed. I™m sure that my parents inasmuch
 as they could have known or not, would not 
bring it up at all. We  we re, I feel, ma ybe Œ I™m sure we were too young to comprehend it, 

and it was no use of burdening us with additional fears, because you live in a world 

where antisemitism was quite pr evalent and we
 ha d enough to deal with the hooligans in 

town who used to call us ﬁdirty Jewsﬂ and 
throw rocks at you on occasion whenever they 
could, you know, and I was accepted. I mean, my 
friends that I went to school with used 
to refer to me ﬁtheyeste shenashaﬂ (ph), as if
 to say ﬁYou are ours, our ownﬂ so to say, 
because I was just like them. You know, I s
poke the language in the same  manner, and 
we started together and we worked toge
ther on school projects and all that, but 
nevertheless, on the way to school, we  had to pass by the area where the fa ctories were, 

and they were kind of closed in by a very 
big fence all around, and 
for about, I would say, 
one kilome ter, there were no homes but ju
st that huge, huge, huge fence. And on that 
fence there were Œ they used whitewa sh, they 
called that thing?  Œ 
all kinds of sign, anti-
Semitic si gns. For example, they said, ﬁ
Be zyd
ﬂ (ph) Œ not to kill the Jews, but hit the 
Jew, or there was a sign ﬁ
Zyd to Pijawka
ﬂ Œ the Jew is a leach, or they used to say, ﬁ
Zy dy 
do Palestyny
ﬂ Œ Jew, go to Palestine. And, you know, it wasn™t pleasant. I don™t know 

who has put, you know, all that stuff on the fe
nces, but they we re never removed. They 
were there all the time. But if 
you live in this type of enviro
nment and you expect to see it 
all the time , you know, on the way to school andon the way home  from s c hool, it kind of 

Œ you don™t pay any attenti
on anymore to it. So– 
 

Q: Did your Christian friends, your Polish Ch
ristian friends, ever comment on that?
 That™s 
terrible, or–?
 
 

A: No, they never commented, and we didn™t 
even talk about it. But you know it was an 
aggravating kind of a thing, th
at a twelve year old one or
 a thirteen year old one, you 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
14 
 
know, we wouldn™t Œ it™s Œ let me  put it this 
way, that I could unde
rstand it better my
 
mother™s desire to plan the eventual immigr
ation to Palestine ba
sed on this kind of a 
situation. This is why she insist
ed that we learn Hebrew, and 
this is why she insisted to 
instill in us the Zionist  idea and this is w
hy she was helpful in creating a Zi onist youth 
move me nt, and we joined, and, you know, we di
dn™t have leaders in the community, so 
they used to bring leaders from larger to
wns who were comi ng once a mo nth to kind of 
give us a defi nite direction more so from 
a contemporary point of view rather then be 
lead by some  adult. And, but you felt it, you 
felt it, and there is Œ there were little 
incidents that were kind of al
ways there. And, I reme mber walking with my father. Father 
came and the railroad station wasn™t far 
from our home. It was like a five mi nute 
distance, you know?  So, I used to Œ knowing that
 Father was comi ng, I used to run to the 
station to kind of welcome hi m and walk hom
e with him. And one time, there was Œ it 
was during the time of the depression, and th
e Polish workers were very unhappy because 
they went on strike, they weren™t paid we
ll enough, and it wa s a very bad situation in 
town. And every time  some thing like that 
occurred, there was a much stronger anti-
Se mitic reaction because it was Œ some body had to be blamed for things that went wrong. 
So, I reme mber, as we went approaching the 
main entrance to our courtyard, there was a 
guy that we knew well and Father knew well,
 and he was standing there and he was 

giving out leaflets and he was repeating ﬁ
Be zyda, be zyda
ﬂ (ph) Œ hit the Jew, hit the 
Jew. And as we came close, I™ll never forget 
that, he took the leafle
ts in his hand and put 
them behind his back, and he already uttered the word ﬁ
Be zyda
ﬂ (ph) and he says 
ﬁEkonomicz i eﬂ, as we we re crossing, he says, ﬁEkonomi czie.ﬂ As if to say, not outright 

hit the Jew, but hit the Jew economi cally, whic
h was more of a legitimi zed way to say it 
for my father not to get offende
d, but he had expressed it. And– 
 

Q: So, you were extremely young at that point? 

 

A: Well, I was ten years old. You know, I could understand it.  

 

Q: Do you have any recollection whether your parents thought of going to Palestine before 
the war broke out or this was–?
 
 

A: 
This was a Œ no, it was a plan that I™m sure 
that they thought a lot 
about it. And ma
ybe if 
at the time, they would have been in a bett
er financial situation, 
ma ybe they would have 
done something about it, but due to the fact
 that up until 1937, as I me ntioned to you 
before, things were difficult between ™33 
and ™37, four years, you know, that you can 
only plan on the things that ar
e needed rather than the long 
term for the future, and then 
of course the war broke out 
so, solved all the problems. 
 

Q: Now, you™ve been using the words ﬁfatherﬂ
 and ﬁmotherﬂ but we haven™t given them
 a 
name . So, before we go on. Let™s give your father and mother their name s. 
 

A: Okay, my mother was Pola, her maiden name was Tannenblum, and she was from 
Ostrowiec, was 
Isaac
, or Isaac in English, Laks. He was 
from Sosnowiec, which is in the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
15 
 
Polish Sl

sk or Silesia as it is 
now in the German language. T
hey me t, I don™t know 
exactly when, but they had a very happy life. 
They really had a very
 happy life, and we 
had a very warm and happy, loving fa mily.  
 
Q: When you describe the anti-Semitic taunts a
nd these th
ings on the fences, do you have a 
recollection that it got worse th
e closer the war came ?  Or does 
it appear to you to be just 
the same, the same stuff all the time? 
Do friends start moving away from you?  
 

A: Well, my sc hool friends were one group, a
nd my
 other friends were another group. Due 
to the fact that I lived in Wi erzbnik, whic
h was basically the community where the Jews 
lived before the consolida
tion of the two. Very early, 
there was a communi ty called 
Wi erzbnik and there was a community called St
arachowice. Wi erzbnik was so to say the 
earlier where all Jews lived and some of th
e non-Jews who even were involved with the 
business or in city admi nistration or in 
jobs, you know, but most people who worked in 

the factories lived in Star ac
howice. As a ma tter of fact, 
in Starachowice they had two 
streets, two main street
s. One street was name d 
Ulica Robotnieza
, which means the st reet 
for the blue-collar clerks, and the other one was 
Ulica Urz


dni c z a
, which was the street 
for the white-collar clerks, and as you passed 
the streets, you could 
see the difference in 
the living quarters and they were
 not too far apart, side by si
de, but in order to bring in 
the skilled engineers and the te
chnicians that were needed in the factories, they had to 
give them some thing mo re than just the 
average housing. Whi l e the workers, you know, 
due to the fact that we were like three or f
our kilome ters away from the factories, they 
settled closer to the factories so that they di
dn™t have to travel that long of a distance. So, 

now, when they consolidated the two communities, we became one, and it was called 
Starachowice. Wi erzbnik was where the Jews
 lived. Starachowice was Œ the school, when 
I went to high school, was Starachowice. Andthis is when I had to pass from home  all 
the way, you know, three kilome ters each way, andas we were getting closer and clos er 

to school, more and more children joined the gr oup, you know, because there was one 

route that we  use, you know. So, actually, we we
re three Œ in my cla
ss, there were three 
Jews, four Jews, three boys, myself and a
nother girl and in th
e class above me was 
another Jewish girl. School opened the first tw
o classes of high school at the time when I 
was ready to go to school. And in this my mo
ther, too, had her finger. She was also very 
helpful in convincing the community that
 it™s about time that
 the population of 40,000, 

which was right before the war, should have a 
school of higher educa
tion, not to have to 
send the children away from home. So, 
she organized a group, you know, and they 
discussed it long enough, and it took two years 
before the school was finally opened and 

it was just in time for me . So, now, I have th
ese friends from Hebrew school that are my 
old friends, from Wi erzbnik, with whom I feel
 very, very comfortabl
e, then I have my 
friends from high school who do not live in Wi er
zbnik, very fe w. Most of them are living 
near the factories because their parents are 
working there, and our 
connections are more 
based on our school work. You know, every once in a while in addition to home work you 

have projects that you have to work together
 on, whatever it was, whether it was in math 
or whether it was in social studies, or what
ever. One of us got an assignme nt, who was in 
charge, and we had to kind of a create a nuc
leus, a group of people who were responsible 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
16 
 
for different things and we  kind of ma de 
a presentation when, le
t™s say, a commission 
cam
e from Warsaw from the National Board of 
Education to see the pr ogress that we are 
making. Usually, they had come for accreditati
on and, you know, to evalua te the level of 
education in the schools, and we had a very 
wonderful school. We  had a really great high 
school. So, I had friends from there with whom
 after school I had hard
ly contact, but it™s 
interesting that, when I went to school, things
 we re not so good yet at home , and I had to 
enter Œ I me an, as I said before, any high sc
hool that you applied to you had to have an 
exam. So, I came out, I mean, very well on my 
exam. I was accepted to school. I was also 

given a 50 percent reduction in th
e tuition, but my tuition was tw
ice as high as my sister™s 
because hers was a federal school, and mi ne was a private school. But I was very 

fortunate that the teachers and the di rector
 of the school liked me  a lot, and they 
recommended to me  for tutoring younger childr
en. So, I went to school, and from school 

usually the kids were the kids of the white-c
ollar clerks in Star ac
howice who were just 
about ready to go to high school and they n
eeded the preparatory exam and so, I was the 
one who was spending like an hour twice a week tutoring them, preparing them for the 

exam, and I was getting paid for it. So, this 
in a way defrayed the cost of my education. 
So, it was really interesting b
ecause on the one ha nd I was very secure and very accept ed 
and comfortable, but if you were to say whet
her I was really seeki
ng outright to be in 
their compa ny, no, and for this reason, I don™
t know whether I would have been very 

comfortable or I would have been uncomfor
table, but I was well liked and respected. I 
am felt that I am very Œ I mean, with the 
school friends, I had neve
r felt any anti-Semitic 
things directed at me  personally. To the 
contrary, we were ve
ry, very friendly. 
 

Q: So, the war come s. Do you recall any prep
aration?
 Did you parents 
say what they think 
was going to happen?  Was it a complete s
hock? Do bombs go off - I mean, what 

happens?  
 

A: It was very strange because we were for 
the new school year. And 
in addition to being a 
me
mber of a  Zionist youth group, I was a me mber
 of a kind of a scout group. It was more 
than a scout group. It was ki
nd of a patriotic Polish group. 
I don™t reme mber even the 
name , that when you entered hi gh school, you 
were kind of elevated to a position of 

responsibility, where you had to show your love
 for the country and responsibility, so 

forth and so on. So, being alre
ady in high school, I was a me mb
er of this particular group, 
and I loved Poland. I mean, to me , Poland was my
 country. I mean, I was a great patriot. I 

was Œ to me, if you would think in terms of
 how much do you love the country, I me an, 
to feel really good and comfortable, I rea
lly loved Poland. Everything, Polish literature 
and whatever was Polish was the best thing 
in the world. There was nothing better. I 
really enjoyed it. So, I reme mber that rather th
an to Œ like, a week earlier, before school 

started. We  were called to come  to school, 
and I can™t recall who was the person who has 
addressed as me mbers of this 
particular youth group, and they
 said to us Œ usually we 
wore the unifor ms during May Day parades, 
you know, and we represented, carrying the 

flag of our school, and ma rched in the parade. S
o, they told us that we have to put on the 
uniforms and we have to gather not far from th
e factories because we have to dig trenches 
for protection from attacks that ma y come  fr
om a i rplanes, that there ma y be a war and 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
17 
 
there is a danger of being bombed due to the fa
ct that we have these factories and that it 
is our duty of young people who love the country to do it. S
o, you know, I was so eager, 
you know. We all went to the pl ace where they 
gave us the spades and we walk along 
with adults and we built the trenches and all that. Of course, they didn™t dr op the bombs 

on our town. They just threw two bombs on th
e railroad station. They whole town, the 
whole community left for the woods. Everybod
y was afraid that th
ey™ll bomb us to 
smithereens, and then I get, after the war, a 
Kalendarium
, what they™re called, from my  
home town because I wanted to know more 
of what it was all about, you know. I went 
from childhood to adulthood and left the country. So, in the 
Kalendarium,
 I found out 
that the chief executive officer of the factor
y that was appointed or
 whatever, placed Œ 
who has gotten this position three years befo
re the war, was a German, a s py, who not 
only spied for the Germans to let them know what
 is the operation like in
 this particular Œ 
because that was a whole region, not just St
arachowice. There was Skarzysko-Kami e nna; 
there was Ra don; there was Pionki. They used to
 call it the central indu
strial area. So, we 
were just one part of that whole region, 
and we found out this 
particular guy was a 
German wh o was ma ybe a 
Volks Deutsch
, you know?  But basically he wa s operating 
with Germa ny, and he told them that to dest
roy that would be ridiculous. They needed it 
for their war effort. So, I found out about 
it, you know, like in 1980, ten years ago, when 
I was finally established a very comf ortabl e 
contact with my hometown, because I just 
didn™t want to think about Poland, you know?  I 
came  to the United States and what the 
United States represents cannot compare with
 any country in the world, and for this 
reason I kind of felt that don™t forget the pa
st, but don™t live in th
e past. Whether it was 
good or whether it was bad, it just doesn™t ma ke 
any difference, the past is the past, and 
for as long as you live you have to look toward
s Œ deal with the present and look toward 
the future. That™s all to it. 
 

Q: So, you evacuated. You dug the ditches, no 
bombs cam
e, and the whole town leaves. 
Now, did you Œ were you back at hom
e  when the evacuation happened?  So, you went 
with your parents and yo
ur sisters together? 
 

A: We all went, we all went into the woods
, the forest, you know?  And we could hear the 
troops fighting, and we could hear the airp
lanes zoom
ing by and bombs being dropped, 
but we were like about eight kilome ters from town, you know, in the woods, and when 

everything calmed down and it was quiet, we re
turned to town. So, we returned to town 
to fi nd the situation like that. All the st ores
 were looted. There was no food available. 
Home s were plundered. Whatever was, whatev
er was of value was taken away. Whether 
it was done by the Germans or whether it
 was done by the Polish neighbors, I don™t 
know, but that was the situation. I reme mber car
rying the silver in a 
knapsack on my back 
to the woods and back, because Mother gave
 everybody some thing else to carry that was 

important. And we came back to home and our
 home , since we lived Œ by then we had 
moved to a modern apartment, because the home where I grew up was an old home, and 

the landlord didn™t want to do much anymore 
in the repairing it and so forth and so on. 
So, we moved to another apartment that was 
built like ™37, and it was built by a Christian, 
by a Pole, Wi erzchowski, and he occupied 
the upper floor, and we were living on the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
18 
 
ground floor, and so it wa sn™t really a Jewish
 courtyard anymore, you know, it was kind 
of a mi
x. There were some stores. I reme mber there was a Polish butcher who lived 
nearby in a small house, and I can™t recollect b
ecause it was a short period of time that we 
lived there. So, due to the fact that we we
re not in a Jewish kind of Œ because some  
courtyards, they had 20, 30 fa milies, and mostly Jewish, you know, so if the homes wer e  
plundered, you know who did it. Bu
t here, due to the fact th
ere weren™t too ma ny, and so, 
we found everything in perfect 
order when I got home . So, th
ere was nothing really that 
was broken or removed or glass broken. I™m 
sure that they wouldn™t have dared, you 

know?  So– Because it was not a Jewish house. 
It was the property of a Pole, so they 
couldn™t break windows in order to get in or 
whatever. And so it wa
s hard because there 
was no food available and things were difficult to get. 
 

Q: Chris, can I interrupt you for a mo ment?  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: When you came back, what was your first 
m
eal in the house?
 Can you describe what 
your father asked you all to do when you first came  back?  
 

A: Well, we came  back, and of course, when
 we we re out in the woods, you know, we didn™t 
have m
uch food. We  took some  bread with us and ma ybe a salami  if I reme mber 
correctly, but we couldn™t get any food. So, 
it was September and we were very close. 
We actually stayed in an agricultural school. 
Basically, it was a school, 
and also a kind of 
a laboratory, research laboratory where 
they were trying to 
introduce, you know, new 
ways of ma ybe growing things. So, there were 
a lot of cucumbers and a lot of toma toes in 
the field, which I imagine that they had been gathered and sold at the market normally, 

but the war broke out and the stud
ents didn™t come to school, so
 everythi ng was left there. 
So, we ate them. You know, you sit in the 
dirt and you ate and you 
don™t have water to 
wash your hands and so forth and so on. We  
got back home, and we had some  potatoes 
left in the dark cellar becaus
e this is where you kept your ro
ots for the winter, your root 
vegetables for the winter, and Mother went 
to the dark cellar and 
she brought up potatoes 
and Father says to set the table. So, we we
re kind of figuring on why does he insist on 
setting the table. He says, ﬁI want the tablecloths on the tabl e. I want the china on tabl e.ﬂ 

He says, ﬁI want the silverware on the tabl
e, and the napkins and lace because, just 
because there is a war doesn™t mean that we
 have to eat like animals. We have to 
reme mber that we are people and we have to
 conduct ourselves in this ma nner.ﬂ And, 
that™s the kind of person that he was. Th
at no ma tter what kind of a situation you 
encountered, first you have to always reme mb
er that you are a human being and you have 
to watch the way Œ you have to be aware 
of how you conduct yourself, and your behavior 
and there was always the priority, stressed on 
the importance of being civil and acting in 
proper ma nner, no ma tter what. So, we had our 
meal: that dry potato 
on a big plate. But 
everybody was happy. Father was happy. We  wash
ed the dishes afterwards. Everything 
was fine. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396

Q: Did the three of you as children find 
it odd, even after the meal?
 Or did you–?  
 
A: No, but that™s the way it always has been. 
I mean, there was no kitchen table. The kitchen 
was a working place, an
d in the kitchen, we ha
d a huge tabl e, but it was a table that had 
like sides all around that was used like a work
 space where they were kneading the bread 
and cutting up the meat and doing all kinds
 of things, and you know, and baking and 
cooking and washing laundry and everything. Th
at was what the kitchen was for. The 
dining room was where we ate, and it was 
this ma hogany big table with the carved legs 
and the carved chairs around it,
 and whether it was breakfast 
or lunch or dinner, I me an, 
we didn™t eat in the same  ma nner as we do 
in the United States. You know, breakfast was 
fast because we all had to go to school, and 
Mother packed a little lunch to take along, 
and dinner was usually when we returned fr
om s c hool. That was the ma in meal around 
two-thirty, and then in the evening wa s just
 a small bite for suppe
r, you know. So, it was 
just a sandwich with cheese or whatever, but
 the ma in meal was always during the day. 

And, it wasn™t like here in the United States
 when you have meat or fish every day for 
your meal. I mean, a lot of times you make 
do with whatever was available, and mi nd 
you, it™s not availability de
pended not so much on how mone y you had, but on the 
seasons. If, let™s say, there was at one time, th
ere was one product in 
abundance, let™s say, 
and then the summer there are other products
 in abundance, and in the fall different 
things, and you kind of geared your whole 
planning around what was available in the 
particular season. So, I reme mber, like, Cornis
h hens, young chickens, we  used to have in 
the summer, and the geese and ducks were in 
the fall and the winter, and then for springs 
there were turkeys, I mean, but they were not
 every day on the table. We  used to have 
like maybe twice, three times a week meat. 
Otherwise, it was dairy products and you had 
to be very, very kind of inventive in orde
r to create meals and my mother was a gourmet 
cook and she really Œ when she entertained, it
 was unbelievable. When s he set that table, 
it was fit for a king. I have this craze now Œ I ha
ve four sets of dishes and with stemware 
and with everything and different
 tablecloths because I have to Œ when I set the table it 

has to be Œ it has to have a very special t
ouch. It™s not just what™s
 si tting there in the 
closet, I™ll ma ke an effort. I™ll go to the b
ack. I™ll pull them out to set a certain mood. I 
don™t do it as much lately because the kids are 
older, I mean, our children are olde r. They 
are out of the house. And Renia is like that
, too, you know. And my dau
ghter is like this, 

too, now, very much aware of what the table should be like, regardless of the me al. But, 

to make an attractive table all by itself make
s the whole meal so much more pleasant. 
Whether you eat a dry potato or whether you have a gourme t meal, it doesn™t ma tter, but 

it is when you enter the dining room, wh
at you create artistically about the looks 
enhances the food you eat like that, too. 
 

Q: Did you have a favorite food?  

 

A: Not really. I loved bread up until now Œ bread 
is my 
m
ost favorite 
thing, but not really, 
not really. I mean, when we were young, we 
didn™t need food, and when we were in 
camp, we didn™t get food. So, how
ever, speaking of 
food, while we are on the subject, I 
reme mber that when we finally were ma king 
our way home after th
e liberation, I turned 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
20 
 
to my older sister Hania, and I said, ﬁWhen
ever I have the opport
unity to cook a soup.ﬂ 
The soups in camp were hardly Œ I m
ean, 
you couldn™t call it soup because it was water 
with some  _______________ on the bottom, and some  floating potato peels ma y be in it 
at the most. So, I used to say, ﬁWhen I cook a 
soup, it™s going to be 
thick that when I put 
a spoon into it, it will stand 
all on its own.ﬂ That was my dr
eam. And, Ha nia said to me , I 
reme mber what she said, she said, ﬁAnd I™m 
going and I would like to
 have a whole loaf 
of bread and not to have to share it with anyone.ﬂ  
 

Q: So, did you live up to that ?  Is that how you cook soup?  

 

A: Oh, I cook great soups. Bean and barley is the most favorit
e because it™s the thickest. The 
spoon doesn™t stand up on its own. It doesn™t 
stand on its own, it n
eeds support, but it™s 
good. 
 

Q: Chris, the first meal that you have when
 you com
e
 back, that meal, and the war had 
started, is there conversation around the tabl
e?  Are you all frightened or do you feel 
frightened?  Or, I mean, nothing?  
 

A: I don™t remember. I don™t reme mber, but you 
know, we felt so secure with our parents 
around us. You know, we never had to worry or 
plan our future. You know?
 We  wer e  in 
a home where the parents supervised our activ
ities. I mean, they planned our schooling, 
they planned where we go to school, and we 
were very obedient children because we 
knew that whatever our parent
s are planning for us, for our 
future, that they know what 
they want and what we should be like from
 their own personal e
xperience. And it™s not 
just, you know, in some  cases, where there were a 
lot of people that we
re totally illiterate 
before the wa r. There were people whose lite
racy was very limited. Some  people had two 
years of education, three years 
of education. They felt the need of education. They didn™t 
have the opportunity. Therefor
e they wanted to give thei
r children the opportunity to 
know more then they did. And the compulso
ry years of study in 
school, in elementary 
schools in Poland, was kindergarten through seve
nth grade. After seventh grade, you had 
enough. It could carry you through life, you 
know, and you were literate and you could 

read the paper, and you knew ma th and you kne
w everything. But if you went to high 
school, then you were only in school for six y
ears. And, it is like the junior high schools 
here, that wa s your first year 
of high school education, because 
we went from six years of 
elementary schools to four years of high sc
hool and then two year
s of Litsonian (ph) 
which prepared you for the study at the univers
ity. So, if you think in terms of years of 
schooling, it was like 12 years from beginning 
to end, from grade one to entering the 
university, if you so desired. So, in my pare
nts case, you know they were both educated, 
and education was very important to them 
and there was no question. I mean, there was 
no question whether we want or
 we don™t want. It™s like, you
 get up in the morning and 
you have to brush your teeth and wash your face
 and have breakfast, and so you have to 
study, that™s it. That™s part
 of your daily activity.  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
21 
 
Q: So, if you™re not feeling f
ear at that mome nt, when do th
ings start changing in some
 
radical way as far as you reme mber? 
 
A: Things start changing as soon as we see th
e action of the Nazi m
ilitary in town. In the 
beginning, you know, when the m
a rched in
to town, nothing happened. Nobody greeted 
them with fl owers, that™s for sure. 
 

Q: Not the Poles, not the Jews–? 

 

A: No, because you see in areas where they had 
Œ since the bord
ers were constantly shifting. 
So, whether or not, you know, afte
r the plebiscite, this is th
e right word in English, as 
well?  
 

Q: Plebiscite. 

 

A: Plebiscite, thank you. Depending on wh
ere you lived, you know, once the border was 
drawn, whether you originally German or 
originally Polish, wherever you lived, you 
became the citizens of this particu
l ar count
ry. So, since the borders had been shifting 
constantly, there were a lot of Germa n fa m
ilies who, after the First World War, after the 
pact in Versailles, were separated from 
their families and so forth and so on, and 

rema ined on the new Polish territories. So, so
me  of them spoke Polish because in their 

fa milies there were Poles and there were Germans and Poles and Germans, and they were 

intermarried so it didn™t really matter that much. But, in some  cases, the people felt very 

strong attachme nt to Germany, and they con-, 
inasmuch as they did in Poland, and they 
send the children to Polish schools, they c
onsidered themselves Germans. So, when the 
Germans entered Poland, of course, they were more then happy to welcome the m bec a use 

this is what they always wanted. We  lived
 in central Poland, so we were far removed 
from both influences, the Russians and the Germans and even the Austrians from the 

south; because we were part 
of that heart of Poland that 
Napoleon has created in a way, 
that 
Kongrasuvka
 (ph) that he called. So, this is
 why they came , the Germans came , 
ma rched through town and sang the songs and al
l that, with victorious people, came. And 
it took about two or three weeks before they
 had organized the whole thing. And they 

started to catch Jews in the 
street to do work. Actually, not
 so much for work as to 
humiliate the Jew. So, I reme mber, I was walkin
g with my father in the street, and he was 
an elegant man, as I said before, and always 
proper and always neat
, always neat, and he 
was wearing a hat and a suit and we walki
ng on the sidewalk, and a German walks by 
from the opposite direction, and he says, ﬁYou™re a Jew! You have no right to walk on 

the sidewalk. The sidewalks are not mean
t for the Jews.ﬂ And, he pushed him. 
Unexpectedly Œ I mean when some body attack
s you like that Œ and he pushed him in the 
gutter. Really, he fell into th
e gutter and he was wearing glasses, and his hat fell off. He 
was wearing a hat not because he was religious, 
but that was part of that elegance of his 
kind of a demeanor. And his glasses fell and he felt so horrible, so humiliated, and the 

guy kicked him over and over again, and he wa
nted to pick himself up. I reme mber, he 
spoke, no, he was asked him, ﬁ
Bist du ein Jude?
ﬂ - Are you a Jew?  And he said, ﬁYes!ﬂ 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
22 
 
And since my father had a lot of dealings w
ith German people, I m
ean, at the time he had 
business cont acts. Before the war, he was re
presenting an internat
ional company and the 
people at the time he dealt were also busine
ss people from also large companies. So, 
there has never been in my father™s, I imag
ine, mind a disrespect for him being a Jew. 
And just from the soldier walking and at the me
re fact that he was honest and said he was 
a Jew, to be pushed off the sidewalk into the gut
ter and to be kicked when he tried to pick 
hims elf up, and his glasses broke, and he was br
ui sed on his face, and he got all dirty and 
everything, that was the fi rst indication. I mean, 
this is for the first 
time that I understood 
what the war was all about. Up until that ti
me, I don™t think I could comprehend what war 
really means because the stories that I have 
heard from either my parents or my grandma 
about wars before, like the First World Wa
r, they had experienced, was basically 
contained in the area in which they Œ th
rough which the front went through. Fifty 
kilometers away from the front, life has not 
been disturbed in any way whatsoever. Only, 
if you happen to find yourself in the path of 
ma rc hing troops or battle
s or whatever, that 
you knew that there was a war. But, in that 
Blitzkrieg that the Nazi
s created, there was no 
such thing as so to say limiting to one speci
fic area or having battles in one area. They 
just went through the whole country - with
in one week, there was no Polish governme nt 
anymore, and immediately th
e Nazi occupation took over. 
 

Q: Did this ma n hurt you, as well?   

 

A: No. 

 

Q: He didn™t touch you?  
 
A: No. 

 

Q: So, did you yell at him?  I mea
n, do you have any recollection?
 
 

A: 
I don™t reme mber exactly. I didn™t reme mber whet
her I ran home and left m
y father to tell 
my mother maybe. You know, it is something 
that I only reme mber how hurt he was 
when he came  in. I don™t reme mber , ma ybe, I 
think that I was with him. But anyhow, I 
reme mber how distraught he was when he 
came home from being treated in such a 
ma nner. He could speak with them and conve
rse, you know, and I am sure that he would 
have expected to kind of say some thing. But w
ith a soldier that carri
es a gun in his hand 
and beats you and kicks you, I mean, there is
n™t much you can do. So, that was his first 
humiliation, and I think that this was an experi
ence that made me a ware that times have 
changed or are just about to change. 
 

Q: Do you remember sharing th
is with your older sister?
 
 

A: 
I really don™t reme mber. I just know that Fa
ther was so bruised and so beaten and he had 
broken glasses, you know. He was wearing eyegla
sses, that there wasn™t anything to ask 
about. I™m sure that everybody realized what that
 situation was like. Of course, we didn™t 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
23 
 
go out in the street anymore, and the 
Judenrat
 was for m
ed, and they came around and 
confiscated valuable things from everybody™s home . 
 
Q: Did they take away your encyclopedia?  

 

A: I don™t remember. I don™t reme mber. I don™t 
think so. We
 lived already in the new 
apartment, and Father had a desk. We didn™t ha
ve this extra room for hi m. So, Father™s 
desk was placed in the living room, and I 
think that Œ I don™t reme mber what ever 
happened to the books. 
 

Q: Do you remember Ger mans comi ng in and confiscating things?  

 

A: I reme mber Germans came in and looked around, and of course, you know, everybody 
was aware that they are comi
ng and asking for 
things. They were elegant. They were not 
just soldiers who were comi ng; they were 
officers who were comi ng to different homes. 
And they used to look around and if they liked
 some thing, they just asked to be wrapped. 
I reme mber a friend of mi ne used to say - he came in and he saw that 
épinière
 on the 
table, and he says to my mother, ﬁ
Oh, das ist schoen. Bitte mir das einpacken
,ﬂ as if to 
say, ﬁThis is beautiful. Pl ease wr
ap it for me .ﬂ You know?  So, this is one of the sayings 
that I reme mber from confiscati
ng things. Again, I think that due
 to the fact that  we were 
not really Œ the second, the new apartment that we were in, since it has not been 

necessarily an all-together 
Jewish courtyard, that I don™t 
remember the Germans coming, 
really comi ng in. But what I reme mb er from the second apartment that we lived is the 

war started, there was no school for Jewish
 children, none whatsoever. We were all 
school age. And again, I™m going to bring 
in my parents, you don™t leave children 
hanging around doing nothing. So, again, my mo th
er™s ingenuity, she says, ﬁListen, it™s 
war. You cannot go to school. This does not mean
 that you™re going to sit idle.ﬂ Hania is 
older than you. In 1940, we already had a lot of
 Jews from large and from Lodz and from 
Poznan (ph), you know, from the regions that we
re incorporated into the Reich. And from 
the large cities, people we re displaced and 
were brought to our town with children who 
were our contemporaries, and they were educ
ated people, and they were sophisticated 
people. So, my mother, in order for me  to not 
to kind of be my sister™s student, where she 
would kind of do whatever she wants with 
me, maybe, has gottenthreeother youngsters 
who were my contemporaries, and my older si
ster was teaching us every day as if we 
were to go to a regular school, okay? When I wa
s done with my classes Œ they were in the 
afternoon Œ in the morning, I was teaching younge
r children. And here we have in the 
new apartment, we already had a small kitchen 
table. So, while my older sister was with 
some  student in the living room, I wa s sitti
ng on the window, I reme mber, on the ledge. It 
was summertime. It was so nice and warm in 
the forties, and I loved the sun Œ and I had 
around the table these little kids
 who I taught to read and taug
ht to write. And it was that 
thing that we  continued, you know, to keep our
selves busy, number one, to continue with 

our educations, number two, and even Renia used 
to play with the little kids. These were 
not even of school age, but just to give he
r some thing to do. So, we had this kind of a 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
24 
 
feeling of responsibility to ourselves, and to ot
hers as well. So, it wa
s all the kids in the 
neighborhood and m
ostly children of our friends younger then us. 
 
Q: Didn™t Hania al
so teach Renia? 
 

A: Yes, that™s what I said. 
Because Hania was teaching Renia in the morning Œ when I was 
teach
ing my  class, Hania was teaching in the morning, but I wa s her student. And, in the 
afternoon, because some  of the boys who were comi ng to class were working, I think Œ 

you know, there was an obligatory labor that 
you had to submit to every day. I me an, if 

you were called, not every day, but
 there were all kinds of j
obs that required on the part 
of the German Nazi administra
tion that needed to be done, 
and the boys who were at the 
time 15 or 16, instead of having their fathers go and do the job, they went to work. So, we 

would really study later on 
in the afternoon when they came back from work. 
 

Q: Okay, let™s take a break.

Tape #3
 
 
Q: Did you not go out very much in those months when you were–?  

 

A: No, we went very little. Firs
t of all, we were very busy. I 
me
an, Mother saw to it that we 
were kept busy, and constructive busy, which 
was very important. But, we used to get 
together with friends, you know, and since our
 ghetto was not closed ghetto, it was an 

open ghetto, it means that part of the town wh
ere there was a large concentration of Jews 
was, got to be a little more crowded with
 the fact that there were newcome r s comi ng 
through from territories that were incorporat
ed in the Reich, and also the few who lived 
not really in Jewish sections
 were forced to move out and to move into the designated 
ghetto area, and this is what happened to us in
 the ™40s. We  left ev
erything behind in the 
apartment because we just Œ inst ead of havi
ng a three-be droom, three-bedr oom Œ a four-
room apartment, we move into a one-room
 apartment. It was large enough, you know, for 
us to put beds at one end and tables, and a ta
bl e at the ot her. We kind of had some space; 
we were not crowded. But we still had Polis
h people living near us, you know. So, some  
sections of town were completely eliminated 
from Jews, but other se
ctions with Jews and 
non-Jews lived together. Of course, the more
 people were comi ng in, the more we were 
crowded, and we had to kind of accept anothe
r family to live with us. And when you live 
with a family and you are limited to the sp
ace and you lose some privacy, it™s all right 
when you were only with your own fa mily. But when another fa mily come s in that you 

don™t know, that is totally strange, whose livi
ng habits are different
 from yours, and who 
are uprooted and who are strange, and it had 
this problem with adjustment. No matter 
how hospitable you are, you still have to have
 a certain amount of privacy, and this 
coexistence with strangers was a very diffi
cult thing to overcome.
 Oh, it was okay. And 
then we fi nd an apartment which was the last apartment before the ghetto was liquidated, 

which was a house on the border of Œ almost out
 of town Œ which was the borderline, but 
the end of the ghetto. And there was a property 
and this property was kind of a duplex. It 
was on the river. It was a duplex, and in one
 part of the house was the owner, who was 
Polish, on the side of the non-ghetto side, and this
 was kind of still considered to be part 
of the ghetto. So, in this house, we had a 
bedroom and a kitchen, and we didn™t have 
anybody to live with us because he wouldn™
t allow Œ the Polish owner would not allow 
any more than just one family. So, in a 
way, this gave us, you know, again, a better 

feeling of a fa mily unit, you know, that we 
had a little more privacy. But, we were 
gathering with our friends. Some  of t hem 
had on the outskirts, lik
e, I had a friend who 
went to school with me  and they also were 
in the lumber business that  was established by 
their grandfather. They were well-to-do peopl
e, and we used to go. They had the river, 
and they were, you know Œ because they need
ed the water for the processing of wood, 

they were Œ like Bentwood for chairs, you know, 
this was their busines
s. So, it was really 
wonderful. It was secluded, and they had like 
a little beach area. So, this is where we 
used to go Sa turdays, and just sit around 
and talk and have time, you know, with our 
friends to ourselves. And, Saturdays usua
lly was a quite time, you know, and Sundays, 
too. So, her parents were very, 
very religious. So, she liked to
 be with us. We had this 
freedom. We used to sit on the beach and enj
oy the sunshine and talk, and everybody was 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
26 
 
doing some thing important. I reme mber one frie
nd was a terrific knitter. She could knit 
anything in the world, and she used to sit a
nd knit sweaters, you know, and this is the 
way how she was supporting he rself during the 
war because I think she lost her mother. 
Her father was in Israel. They were supposed
 to go to Israel,and I don™t know how it 
came about, but she was alone and she lived, so
 to say, with the cousins, and she was 
sitting always and knitting, and this is how she 
used to support herself. She used to ma ke 
the most beautiful hand-knitted sweaters a
nd everything. But, those days you don™t have 
no yarn. So, you used to rip apart old scarves,
 and old sweaters, a
nd caps and whatever, 
and ma ke a new garment and you have to be a genius to ma tch the colors, to come  up 

with an interesting product, which she always
 did. She was wonderful. And we used to 
spend time, and that was our free time, you know. Again, it wa s always in the company 

of the friends with who I went to Hebrew
 school and who were my, so to say, also 
me mbers of the Zionist youth group and we 
were recollecting, you know, remi niscing the 
wonderful days that we had. We  had a leader
 in the youth group. At 
first, we had a group 
when we we re very young; we belonged to 
Hano™ar Ha™t Zioni
. That was the Zionist 
children™s group. And then, when we got a little
 bit older, there wa
s a kind of another 
branch of the same  organization, but it was 
more on an intellectual level, and it was 
called 
Akiba
 and 
Akiba
 used to be, I mean, we didn™t 
have anyone in town who could 
really supervise us at this leve
l. So, Krakow was the center or 
Akiba
, and they were 
sending to us leaders who were comi ng once a week to spend time with, once a month, 

I™m sorry Œ to spend time and teach us songs 
and lectur e and discuss Hebr ew writers and 
Hachman Bialik and all those th
ings. So, we Œ I reme mber one 
leader who was with us in 
1939 and her name  was Vushka Liebeskind a
nd she was, during the war, she ma rried 
Dolek Liebeskind, who was the head of the resistance moveme nt in Krakow. So, to us 
she was everything in the world. We  couldn™
t wait long enough for her, you know, from 
one month to the other to come . And mi nd 
you that in Auschwitz, she found us. She was 
in prison too. And what she has done to our 
spirit in one hour, in Auschwitz, when we 
were really Œ it was Yom Kippur. We were Œ we
 arrived in July and we lost compl e tely 
track of time , and I don™t know whether the ho
lidays fell in Se ptember or October, but 
some where around there. I don™t remember exac
tly. She has been in prison since 1943, 
and because she was the kind of a person she was, and had outside cont acts due to the 

fact that they were part of the resist ance 
move me nt in Krakow, that she had connections 
which allowe d her to kind of move around the 
camp a lot freer, let™
s say, than a person 
without connections. And I understand now that
 she was the one who put the emphasis in 
the spiritual aspect of that  survival in c
oncentration camp, and from
 what I heard about 
her was that she was finding little pieces
 of candles that were Œ you know, in the 
beginning, there was no electricity in camp, so th
ey used candles, or whenever they were 
not allowed to use electricity and they stil
l needed in the barr
acks a light, you know, for 
the work, for the admi nistrative work, they had the candles. So, when the candle was 

almost at the end, you know, it was discarded. 
So, from what I understand, she used to 
collect the pi eces of candles and bring them 
to people on Friday night, right before the 
Lagerruhe
, you know, before people were not allo
wed to leave the barracks. And she 
used to say the blessings and people Œ it 
did not make to her any difference which 
barracks she went to, wherever there were 
wome n Œ and that™s what she did. And we 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
27 
 
were already, so to say, with a noose around our 
necks, in such a ba
d situation, because it 
was already three months that we already ar
rived in Birkenau, and you know, that it was, 
so to say, a point where we didn™t say any 
chance for survival or anything. And I 
rem
e mber we came from the ward, and a very 
pretty woma n with a striped uniform a nd a 
kerchief around her hair, you know, her hair 
was cropped short. She was not Œ her head 
was not shaved like ours, but she had this a
nd she had very good shoes on her feet, and I 
thought, ﬁWell, you have to be well connected 
to kind of look this way when you were in 
camp.ﬂ And she started to ask around. It was after the 
Zählappel
, after we had been 
counted. Some ti me s we had like half an hour be
fore we were allowed to the barracks, or 
some ti me s we were imme diately forced to go 
into the barracks, and she says, ﬁAre any 
girls he r from Starachowice?ﬂ So, there were fi
ve or six of us that
 were me mbers of the 
youth move me nt, and she told us who she was.
 Of course, we were unrecognizable at the 
time. I mean, from hunger and from beating a
nd from the condition that we were and the 
clothes that we wore, we all 
looked like skeletons already an
d ridiculous really. So, she 
says, ﬁGirls, don™t worry.ﬂ She says, ﬁI™m goi
ng to visit you again,ﬂ and she says, ﬁIt™s 
late now. I must run to the barracks before 
they catch me after the allowed time to be 
outside.ﬂ And, then she came . And it was the 
eve of Yom Kippur, Ko
l Nidre night. And 
she came with candles, and she got up on th
e bunk bed and the candles were lit, and 
nobody knew Kol Nidre by heart. I mean, we 
were Œ how could we remember?  We  
reme mbered the chanting, just the melody. S
o, we were chanting the Kol Nidre me lody, 
and it was kind of an outpour of a feeling for 
unity, because it was some thing that we had 
in common from not from this period in 
Auschwitz, but from a
nother time. And, of 
course, we couldn™t have that much time  to sp
end with her so, she ju
st brought the spirit 
of the holiday to us, and kissed and she says
, ﬁDon™t give up.ﬂ I reme mber, ﬁDon™t give 
up.ﬂ And we parted company. And when 
we stopped our chanting, the barracks was 
divided in four sections, a
nd the extreme left of our ba
rracks, there was a group of 
women from Italy, Jewi sh women from Italy. 
And when we stopped the Kol Nidre, they 
started to sing ﬁMama Son Tanta Feliceﬂ, like
 an expressi on of their longing to the life 

that they had been deprived of just like we. 
Ours was a religious expression of some  thing 
that was meaningful and traditional. They ma
ybe  did not understand. I™m sure they were 
Jews. They should have been familiar, but their reaction to this chanting in a very quiet 

voice comi ng from the other side was just so 
overwhelmi ng that I will 
never forget it. So, 
what I think about it is that
 in the worse times, when you have a little spark of nor ma lcy, 
when you can™t think what life is really like 
in normal existence, 
when you think in terms 
of the holiday and observing the holiday and pr
eparing for it, or whatever connection you 
have, you know, with some thing that is near an
d dear to you, if you can create it in the 
most horrible situation, it still can 
be very, very uplif
ting. I shouldn™t–cry. 
 

Q: Do you know that Italian song?  

 

A: I know it, yes, but I don™
t know the whole thing. I know– 
 

Q: Can you sing a little bit of it?  

 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
28 
 
A: I don™t know if I can sing now 
after all this crying. I don™t k
now the words. I know it goes 
like this: [Sings first part] 
I don™t know the words really. [Sings on ‚la™]. And then it 
starts [Sings on ‚la™]. And, then it was a 
beautiful very beautiful song, and the word 
ﬁMamaﬂ. Mam
a , you know, inasmuc h as it st
arts ﬁMama Son Tanta Feliceﬂ, which 
means Ma ma, I™m so happy, but you know when I think of this me lody and when I heard 
it for the first time, you know, a
nd it kind of remi nds me  of 
Mein Yiddishe Mame
 to a 
certain extent, it™s a different ma ma , it™s a 
different situation, but it™s the longing for 
home . It™s the longing for mother. It™s the mo
ther who, in my opini
on, that it represents 
the home, and the security and everything, and this
 is what they really needed and this is 
what they wanted. So, I™ll wipe my eyes.  
 

Q: Are you okay?  

 

A: I™m fine.  

 

Q: So, if we can go back to the ghetto now, fo
r– If you can explain to people, because they 
don™t Œ there are different ways in which ghe
ttos function, different ways people m
oved. 
When you have to m
ove from your apartment that you were living underneath the gentile, 
the Polish Catholic, were you forced to moved out and forced to move into a particular 

place or  did you choose the place? 
 

A: Well, we couldn™t choose much really. You see the Judenrat was for med, and then 
Judenrat was basically the admi
nistration of
 the ghetto and the people, and they were 
responsible for all the dema nds
 ma de  by the Nazi authorities
 or whatever. Whether it was 
a dema nd for contributions or whether it wa
s a dema nd for labor or whether it was Œ 
whatever the demand was. So, my father, due to the fact that he was very fa miliar with 

figures and very familiar with the German language was asked by the Judenrat to 

supervise the working groups that were comi
ng daily to work. They gave him this job, 
you know, he was not part of the Judenrat. He
 was not a me mber of the Judenrat, but 
rather  than to have the soldiers come ev
ery morning and catch people in the street, 
whoever was available and most of the peopl
e who were caught in the street where not 
even fit for the work that they wanted them 
to do. So, the Judenrat came  to the conclusion 
that it would be much better if there was lik
e an employment  office where the authority, 
the Nazi authorities would come  and sa
y, ﬁWe ne ed that ma ny, so-and-so people 
tomorrow for work.ﬂ And, that this number of  people should be sent for the daily work 

and eliminate this 
Lapaniki
, as they call them, that they can Œ 
Lapa
 means to drag, to 
drag people off the street. So, they gave my 
father the job. My father Œ they gave him a 

list of all the people who were regi stered 
because food was rationed, so in order to 
receive food you have to register with the 
Judenrat, whether you were a local person or 
whether you were a person who was brought fr
om a different area to town. All those 
people had to be registered. So, the first job 
my father was given is to regist er all the 
people who are able to perform work. Now, 
in the open ghetto, there were still people 
conducting business, because once things ha
d settled down there wasn™t that much 

business. You didn™t deal in extraordinary things, but you know, the guy who was selling 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
29 
 
shoes and galoshes, as long as he had a suppl
ier who provided the me
rchandise to him, he 
could do it, or the guy wa s selling sweaters or
 whatever. The bakery had to be run, you 
know, and all that. So, first of all, the Judenrat
 gave my father the entire list of people 
who were able to work, and on this basis, my
 father could pr epare a list. Let™s say there 

was a dema nd for 200 people or 100 people what
ever it was, and he has arranged it in 
such a way that everybody had to perfor
m the work once a week in the beginning. 
Assumi ng that you were designated to come  to
 work on Tuesday, and either you were too 
busy or you didn™t want  to, as long as you were 
able to pay another pe
rson to fill in for 
you, it was okay. And there were Œ those peopl
e who didn™t want or 
couldn™t go and were 
able to afford it were more than happy to pa y for the day™s work to another person, and in 

most cases, the people who were filling for 
this person were people who were displaced, 
who needed the day™s work, because  when they 
went to work they got paid from the man 
whose place they have taken, and they have
 gotten a bowl of soup and some  bread on the 
job. So, this worked extremely well, and it was 
calm due to the fact that Father could Œ 
what do I want to say Œ he communicated with
 them and there were no beatings and there 
was no chasing and there was no running, and it
 was calm and it was good. As a ma tter of 
fact, you know, he some times used to come  ho
me and say, ﬁIt™s such a shame,ﬂ he says, 
ﬁI had so ma ny eager people today who want
ed to go and work, and there was none of 

dema nd for them to be sent.ﬂ It was just Œ 
that was in the beginni
ng, because later on the 
whole thing didn™t ma tter, you know, no ma tter 
how orderly you were. But there were 
really people comi ng there every morning 
and sitting there wa
iting for someone who 
came in and say, ﬁI™m not going to work t
oday. Who™s the guy who™s going to be in my 
place and take it for the day?ﬂ It was a perf
ect kind of an arrangeme nt, and it was peace 
and calm and wonderful, and it went on like this
 because the jobs were meaningless in 
the beginning. All they di d was to humiliate the people, to get them out, the permanent 

people in the community, and kick them and be
a t  them, just like the incident with my 
father, and just ma ke life difficult. But whenthings began to kind of become  more or less 

orderly, they came to the conclusion that they
 needed the Jews not just for the ma nual 
work of swe e ping the street, giving the perm
anent people a broom to sweep or whatever 
to humiliate them, but they can use them pe
rformi ng manual work in fact ories. They 

started to ma ke dema nds for labor force fo
r the factory. So, this
 whole thing changed 
about, too, because, from that gr oup that was trying to kind of find other people to fill for 

them at work, they realized what is going on 
in other parts of the country, where people, 

if they are not employed, are been resettle
d, taken away, that they seek themselves 
employme nt  and in order to have the 
arbeitskart
e, they went to work. So, there™s this 
arbeitskarte
, which is the certificate of e mployme
nt, protected you from being deported 
later on. So, you know, everything was kind of a gr
adual change from a bad situation into 
a worse situation, and constant
ly changing because the dema nds were greater and greater 
and greater. First they took 
away your money, and then they took away your valuables 
and your furs Œ do you know that as a child in
 my picture with my two sisters, I™m 
wearing like a three-quarter co
at that already I was growing 
and it was time for me  to get 
a new coat. And then the war broke out and 
I still had that coat. It was very warm 
because it had a lining, a fur lining, that I was walking in that jacket in the street and a 

German sol dier ripped off the fur collar of my
 coat, telling me that
 a Jew does not wear 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
30 
 
fur. It was not a fur piece. He did not even
 know the lining there wa
s like a shell would 
you say, right?
 But just by ripping off a collar of my coat– So, you know, they were 
imposing all kinds of things every day, every 
day. First, you know, that they confiscated 
the valuables from you. They took everythi
ng you had. Then they ma de you wear the 
armband with Œ the white armband with the 
blue star, the Star of David, and no ma tter 
how old you were, whether you were ten years 
old or whether you were an old person, 
you had to be identified as a Jew. And if 
they caught you without the armb and and, even 
though for us to mi x in with the Polish populat
ion wasn™t so difficult because we weren™t 
really locked in or fenced in, but nobody, 
nobody dared to even to take off the armband. 
We kind of felt that this is wh
at we have to, and this is how
 we have to work, and it™s 
going to be all right, and the Judenrat reall
y, the people who were in the Judenrat were 
people who were leaders of the community be
fore the war. They were decent, nice, 
elegant people who were friends of my pa
rents, who were memb
ers of the Zionist 
organization, who worked together, you know, 
and they just assume d this responsibility 
to have a peaceful Jewish community, for it to continue. But you never knew, every 

morning was a different dema nd for the speci
al assessment of funds. They came that 
unless the community™s going to produce so 
and so ma ny zlotys, you know, for whatever 
within 24 hours, there are going to be measures taken that everybody™s going to regret. 

So, of course, each and every family was a
ssessed with some  contribution in order to 
create the funds that were dema nded. So, life 
wasn™t easy, but Father was pleased that he 
could occupy peacetime in a very constructive 
wa y, and he was instrume ntal in crea ting, 
so to say, a controlled atmosphere in the ghett
o, where Jews did not ha
ve to be grabbed in 
the morning, you know, whether they were on th
eir way to a morning service or running 
Œ there was no synagogue, anyhow, because 
the synagogue was burned on Yom Kippur 
day in our town. They thought that Kol Nidre 
night Œ they didn™t realize that Kol Nidre 

was the eve before Yom Kippur, 
and they knew that the Jews 
are going to be congregated 
on Yom Kippur in the synagogue. So, they came in the evening hoping that the 

synagogue is going to be full of Jews, and torched it. But nobody was there and nobody 

prayed in the synagogue anyhow; everybody ha
d their prayers in home in, you know, and 

gathered in private homes or in
 the quarters of different orga
nizations that they had, like 
small little clubs. They weren™t really ﬁclubsﬂ as
 we know them in the United States, but, 
you know, a gathering place for different orga nizations because there was the general 

Zionists and there was the 
Betar
 and there was the revisi
onists and, you know, that was 
the group of 
Jabotinsky 
and there was an orthodox group of Jews who I don™t reme mber 
the name  of their organization. So, you know
, it was more like gathering out of sight 
where you couldn™t be too obvious and not too 
ma ny people at the same  time  could be 
found in one particular place. 
 

Q: Do you remember approxima tely wh
at year the synagogue was burned?
  
 

A: 
That was 1939. 
 

Q: It was 1939, right
 at the beginning. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
31 
 
A: First Yom Kippur. 
 

Q: So, let me  go back to my question about the moving. When you moved from the house to 
this more modern place– 
 

A: 
That was very modern by comparison with 
what was available. So, we moved and this 
apartment has been giv
en to us by the Judenr
at because they knew which home s were in 
the ghetto where you were permitted to live a
nd, on the basi s of how large the family 
was, they were so to say Œ it™s like my 
father, who was running the departme nt of 
supplying the labor force to the factories, 
there was a person who was in charge of 
allocating living quarters for people. So, I 
really don™t know who was in charge, but 
anyhow, when we were forced to mo ve from that
 apartment, we went to live in that one 
room which was a large room, a very large room, but it was not Œ it must have been a 

store at one time or another because I vaguely
 reme mber seeing a stove or  anythi ng like 
that. It was kind of Œ it was a large space, but
 nothing to it, and then when we had to 

share it with another family because it was 
such a large space, it wa
s not a home of any 
kind. This is why my me mories 
are so– not quite clear. All 
I reme mber is that it was a 
large space. It was our second move. It was our
 Œ we had another move yet. From there, 
we had to move to another one which was a c
ourtyard also full of Jews, and there, it was 
all very, very hard, because we were so many fa milies. Not just in our apartment, we 

always had to share an apartment with anot
her family, but there were Œ every single 
apartment had additional people and depe
nding on the size, you know, you were allowed 
to a room and then you shared the kitchen f
acilities or whatever. So, that was the third 
move, and then finally, this for the last year
 or  so in the ghetto, this apartment on the 
border of the ghetto and the outside of the ghetto
 was available, and this is, I™m sure that 

it™s, it has been wonderful, it has been a blessi
ng to be able to be by ourselves, but then 
Mother was working, and every apartment ha
s some thing that was so painful and so 
horrible. Mother was working with people as
 I told you before, and she was the one who 
had helped to organize the soup kitchens 
for the people who were comi ng, brought to the 
ghetto and they were bringing constantly peop
le because they needed people to work in 
the factories. So, and ther e were a lot of 
destitute people who had nothing so, providing 
for them, everyone to live, was one of the 
most important things. Providing for them a 
job where they could go to the factory a
nd even though at the time we we ren™t paid 
anything, anymore Œ once you went to the fact
ory, you were not paid a penny, and by that 
time, everybody was anxious to have  an 
employment card. So, nobody was willing to 

give the destitute people any help. So, they 
organized the soup k
itchen, and Mother was 
there working every day, and one day she 
came home  and she was sick with Typhoid. 
 

Q: Typhoid?  Typhus or Typhoid?  

 

A: Typhus, typhus from lice. She must have 
been bitten by a lice wo
rking with the poor 
people, by a louse, and she got very, very sic
k. A
nd I was alwa ys there, in no ma tter what 
situation, I was the one who wa
s the most trained to be of
 assistance, and I™ll tell you 
why. A very logical thing Œ my 
oldest sister was not home. She was away in school when 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
32 
 
she was growing up. She left home very early 
at the age of twelve. So, she wasn™t around 
home
 base, you know, to be taught or
 to observe or to learn. Re
nia, my l ittle sister, was a 
little thing. So, I always 
Œ it seems like my parents kind of felt that I am of more help to 
them than anyone of us. So, I reme mber that 
when Mother got very sick and the doctor 
came to see her Œ you know, we had Jewish doctors
 in town and they all were friends. It™s 
not just like Œ they didn™t come as a docto
r. They came to help you because they were 
doctors and they had the me dical knowledge
. And I reme mbe r  how the doctor sat down 
with me and he said to me Œ it was like the 
fourth or the fifth da
y, and it takes like six 
days, twelve days from t he time when you get sick until you go through the crisis. So, in 

the beginning, you know, he just was comi ng in 
every day to look after her and gave her 

whatever kind of me dication he had availabl
e. I don™t know. But then, towards the eighth 
day, he sat me down and he 
said to me , ﬁIt™s going to be very, very difficult for your 
mother for the next four days, and I want
 you to know that you, 
that it™s up to you how 
much attention you are going to pay and how
 mu ch time you are going to spend with her 
in order to assist her and pu
ll through this difficult period.ﬂ And, he explained to me  what 
kind of symptoms to look for, that her fever is
 going to get very, ve
ry high, and there is 
very little medication that 
can be acquired because, you know
, it™s not normal times, and 
he will try hi s very best but he doesn™t know 
how much he can do, that I ha ve to always 

be at my mo ther™s bedside, that she does 
not need food, but she needs that constant 
presence by her side, because the fever is goi
ng to be very, very high and I have to wa tch 
her very carefully and I have to
 have a basin of cold water and I have to have washcloths 

to change her compress on her head. That 
was the only thing you could do to kind of 
bring down the temperature. And, you know, 
I listened. You know, some body said to me  
that I am very good in doing thing, you know
, the right way. I am always following 
instructions very carefully because what I 
am taught; I was always told very carefully 
how to proceed in doing things. So, if you 
follow instructions, you follow instructions. 
But, anyhow, this was his advice and I didn™
t know what to antic
ipate really, but I 
listened very carefully and I got prepared. A
nd the tenth day was not so bad. Mother was 
still aware of the fact that
 I was around, and the doctor to
ld me  that nobody should be in 
the room with her, just I, and to keep the sh
ades in the window closed so that the room is 
dark. It should not dist urb her, so that she 
has a lot of sleep, because
 this is very, very 
important, but at the same time, I shouldn™t allo
w her to sleep for too long, because this is 
very bad for her. Mind you, I™m only fifteen 
years old or sixteen, whatever Œ and, you 
know, the worst day was the night of the eleventh, the eleventh day of her sickness. 

When I touched her, the heat was unbelieva
ble and she Œ she was kind of delirious, she 

didn™t know what was happening, and she was 
talking and she was saying, ﬁTake her 

away from me. I just don™t like her. She is
 so ugly. She is so horrible with the black 
clothes on.ﬂ I™m sitting there with the person that
 I love so much, and here is this horrible 
responsibility on my shoulders, and the doctors
 gave strict orders to everybody. He said, 
ﬁPull the ma ttress out of this 
room, put it in the kitchen some where, and stay if you want. 
If you want your mother to live, you have got 
to give her total a
nd complete peace and 
quiet.ﬂ It was some thing that 
I™ll never forget because, if you think in terms of fighting 
back, you know, and having that strength to real
ize that this is the mo me nt, and asking 

for this death to be taken away. I mean, after 
all, who is there in the black thing looking 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
33 
 
horrible?  You know, and that was very, ve
ry difficult Œ later afternoon, usually the 
temp
erature was rising. In the morning, the 
temperature was not as high, but as the 
afternoon set in it was always very, very 
high and it was getting higher and very bad, and 
I was changing her comp resses and holding my hand on her hand to just give her 

comfort, for her to know that some body is with her, and finally the following morning, 

she opened her eyes. And I could see that she 
feels better because for two days, she didn™t 
even Œ her eyes were just almost, not co
mpletely closed, but I could see that the 
temperature was really getting her down. A
nd, you know, then she got well. I felt good 
that I have a mother. That was wonderful, ve
ry happy, that I was capable to do the job. 
My sisters, of course, no doubt, 
were just as happy as I was,
 and Mother went right back 
to work as soon as she felt better, she resu
me d her obligations that was the community 
and the people in the community and so fort
h and so on. Then, more and more people had 
to be employed in the factories so everybody w
ho lived in town outside of the very old 
and the very sick had to go to work, and Moth
er was working also in the factories in a 
department, and my little sister  was working in
 the factory, and Hania, my older si ster , 

and myself were working in the beginning in 
a brick factory because
 they needed brick 
for construction of new space for the ma nufactur
e of ar ms , and Father was in charge  of 
the 
arbeitsamt
, ma king sure that if some body was sick
 and couldn™t go to work, that he 
found some one who went to work that day, a
nd then came the liquidation of the ghetto. 
 

Q: Can I ask you some thing?   

 

A: Yeah. 

 
Q: You were fifteen or sixtee
n years old taking care of your 
m
other. That m
ust have been 
really frightening. 
 
A: It was. It was very frightening. 

 

Q: Who took care of you once that was over?
 Did anybody think about
 this happening?
 
 

A: No, as a ma t t er of fact, I reme mber, when
 the doctor came
 and she felt better, and the 
doctor came  and he says Œ as I said before
, the doctor was a friend. He didn™t come  
because we could afford the luxury of a doctor, you know. He came by because he wa s a 

friend and he wanted to assist her. So, I sa
y to him, ﬁShe didn™t eat in two days. Wha t  
should I give her? ﬂ Not that we had that mu
ch food, but the food was Russian and so we 
have bread and we have a jam and saccharin, 
and Ersatz coffee and stuff like that. He 
says, ﬁShe shouldn™t be eati
ng anything heavy, and I know that you can not cook her soup 
or anything like that. I™m going to
 see to it that I get for you a l
ittle bit of farina, like, grits 
or whatever.ﬂ And, he says, ﬁAnd, I™ll s
how you how to cook it, because you cannot 
prepare anything that she won™t be able to 
eat.ﬂ I still reme mber how I pulled out that 
little pot and he told me how much water to
 put it in and put it 
on the stove, and he 
measured it with a teaspoon or a tablespoon, 
I don™t reme mbe r , and how he taught me  
how to prepare that tablespoon of fa rina. When
 to put it in, ﬁWhen the water come s to a 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
34 
 
boil,ﬂ he says, ﬁPut it in. Stir
 it. Cook it for about two or 
three mi
nutes until it become s 
thicker in its consistency. Let 
it cool a little bit, 
and feed your mother, and give it to her 
three times a day.ﬂ And, then he said to me , 
ﬁAnd when she feels a 
little better...ﬂ I still 
reme mber the order of the food that she wa
s supposed to eat. He says, ﬁAnd when she 
feels a little better, ma ke su
re that you get hold of some  beets and because if you cook the 
beets the beet juice is going to
 be very helpful for her blood circulation with that.ﬂ Beets 
are for blood, whether it was circulation or anyt hing, to strengthen her. This is how mu ch 
I reme mber. It was a responsibility, but it 
was nothing. It wasn™t a burden. It was 
something I did with the great
est of love to ma ke sure 
that  Mother survived. Well, 
Mother was the best, in my opinion, in the 
world. There haven™t been too ma ny peopl e 
like her who have done so much for others, and 
yet she was the first one to be taken away 
from us, and she was the first one to go to
 Treblinka, by some  freak accident. So, what 
am I to tell you?  Then, three years later, or 
a year later, when we were in camp already, 
my two sisters got sick with Typhus, but by 
then I was already experienced. Then my 

father got sick, and then I got sick. So, it 
was Œ I was the nurse going from one to the 
other, but the cases, as they
 were comi ng along, there was a lot less to work with, and 
there was no advice from a 
doctor anymore because the doc
tor wasn™t there anymore. 
And, but some how we ma naged, and some
how we survived. So, the ghetto was 
liquidated in October 1942. Up to that point, th
ings were not the best
, but things were not 
the worst, because when you went to work, 
you received some food at the factory. There 
was always soup served duri
ng, you know, we worked 12 hours. There we re two shifts 
for the Jews. Nor mally, the factory worked on 
three shifts for the regular workers. The 
Jews were working 12-hour shifts. So, ther
e was always food, a bowl of soup, that was 
served during the working hours. So, in a 
way, you know, you didn™t have much to eat in 
the morning when you left for work, butsome how some where along the line, your soup 

came along and a little coffee and it was okay. It
™s, it™s the kind of 
existence where you 
really are so limited to what you can do, a
nd what you can say and what you can think, 
and it isn™t like I™m going to rebel or I™m goi
ng to strike or anything. You had no choices. 
There are no choices. All you had to do was ju
st kind of constantly submit to everything 

that is imposed on you and you have to do and do
 and do, and try to deal with it in a way 
that you don™t break down emotionally or phys
ically, because I could see that anybody 
who couldn™t deal with it didn™t last too l
ong. They didn™t have to be in Auschwitz. 
Auschwitz was the worst experience, but even 
here. There were two friends of mi ne who 

came from Lodz ghetto, twin sisters, beautif
ul girls. One was a redhead, I mean, there 
wasn™t a person in the world who wouldn™t 
notice her, you know?  She had the wonderful 
personality. She was friendly and pretty and 
everything, and the other was very dark Œ 

dark hair, but bright , well brought up, nice,
 wonderful two girls. And up until the time  
they were in ghetto, their parents were w
ith them, and fr om the ghetto they were 
employed, and for one reason or another, the 
people Œ their parents Œ did not survive. 
Those two girls didn™t last long at all. Firstof all, they came from 
most likely a wealthy 
home  and therefore they didn™t 
know how to take care of them
selves. So, outside of being 
hungry and having very little to 
eat and not having their pa
rents around to care for them, 
they didn™t even know how to wash their unde
rwear that they were
 wearing. I mean, all 
you had was one set. If you™re lucky, you ha
ve two, right, for a change, but no matter 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
35 
 
what, if you have one or two, we always 
ma
naged some how to keep ourselves clean. 
Those two girls, you could see them fade aw
ay. There was nothing. They just couldn™t 
manage. They had each other and they couldn™t 
help one anot her because they were both 
helpless.

Q: You spoke a few mi nutes ago, prior to telli
ng the story of the two 
sisters who could not 
withstand what was going on, and you said pe
ople had no choices, but in som
e  ways you 
really describe choices. You chose to have
 a certain relationship 
to what was happening, 
or didn™t you?  It was that you 
chose not to be defeated in 
what was going on, in so far as 
one could choose those kinds of things. 
 

A: I wouldn™t call it choices. I don™
t think that choices would be 
the right application in this 
particular case because
 you c
ouldn™t predict what is going to
 happen, not from one day to 
another. From one morning to the en
d of the day, you never know, you couldn™t 
anticipate what is going to ta
ke place. So, I wouldn™t say that
, that choi ce is the right 
description of the situation. I f
eel that you have to have a very strong desire to live, and if 
you have a strong desire to live, I think th
at one can ma nage, under the most adverse 
condition, to live or try to kind of survive in
 a way that one doesn™t break down and one 
doesn™t emotionally. The worst thing was br
eaking down e motionally. Physically, from 

one day to another, we were really losing 
our strength and it was 
quite obvious, but no 
ma tter what your physical condition was if 
you were not outright sick, and you did not 

give in, but you had this feeling that you 
would overcome the difficulties because you 

want to survive, then this was, in a wa
y, your strength that gave you hope. Hope was the 
most important thing because, if you had hope, you didn™t breakdown emotionally. Once 

you broke down e motionally and you were re
signed completely that life is not 
worthwhile living, or you woul
d find yourself in a situation 
that who needs it anymore to 
suffer so mu ch. Everybody that one loved is gone 
and to just rema in alone in this world. 
There were many situations like such situati
ons like this. Some  
people did not survive 
because they didn™t know how to manage. So
me  people did not survive because they 
were too aggressive and for this they were 
punished by being killed 
or clobbered to death. 
Some  people did not survive due to the fact th
at they were physically so exhausted that 
they came to the conclusion that, whether they
 go to work that day and drop dead on the 
job or whether they will not get out of 
bed, but quote-unquote-unquot
e, it was always 
they Œ what do you call it?  The bunk bed or the bert
h or whatever that yo
u slept in, it just 
didn™t make any difference at all. And it 
was wome n who were older who had fa milies 
whose children were taken away from them 
like in Auschwitz, who didn™t know whether 

their husband survived or not, to them life 
was meaningless. It took a very, very strong 

individual really to have th
is very strong desire to liv
e when it came to who had the 
fa mily life or already had responsibility to
 a husband and children. And, it is, I think, 
young people like ourselves who Œ maybe that wa
s that instinct of a survival, like a 
young puppy who is in a situation 
that is not familiar with
 and the mo mma dog is not 
around, and they have to some ho
w either hide or whatever 
to get out of the situation. 
Quite often I think about it, in
 such a way, that instinctive in a way animalistic, which is 
ma ybe not the right expression. The desire to 
survive, without logi
c, without anything, 
but just that  instinct, that feeling that  I have 
to ma nage, I have to be aware that it is a very 
dangerous situation, and some how I must get out
 if it. So, this was very important, and 
then it was very important to have some one
 who was able to assist you, and there were 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
37 
 
people who were willing to assist you Œ 
not because they knew you, not because they 
wanted to, it was just that it 
was Œ it just happened. It happene
d so that you were at the 
right p
l ace at the right time
, and somebody who was right th
ere near you who was willing 
to help you. And this kind of a situation we
 found ourselves in Auschwitz. We ca me  in 
1944, in July. By the mi ddle of October, it wa
s a pathetic thing to 
look at us. We  were 
hungry. We  were beaten. We  didn™t have any cl
othes. I worked in a detail where they 
took us out to a river to cut underbrush
 because it was the beginning of underground 
activities in Auschwitz and people were escapin
g, so in order to cl
ear the view for the 
watchtowers, there was ma rshland, so they took 
us out to work there.
 And I still have my 
shoes on my  feet that I came  in, whi c h were 
good shoes, and I reme mber I left the shoes 
Œ I was working in the ma rshes and I sunk to 
my feet, and I came out 
of it with the tops 
of the shoes because the bottom 
were so rotten already that they got stuck in that mud. 

And it was October, and I was strong when I came in, you know. People that were good Œ 

they were all good. There were no bad people because we really had to depend on one 

another so much that nobody had much, but still,
 if they saw you in that situation that you 
really needed help, they were trying to assi
st you. So, I reme mber comi ng back in from 
work and it was very cold, and some body gave
 me  clogs, wooden clogs, and I couldn™t 
walk in them. They were rubbing my feet and 
I walked barefoot, and 
it was just horrible. 
And when we came to the barracks, some body gave me  a regular boot, which was a very 

good, laced up boot. It wa s too big for me . It mu
st have been a ma n™s shoe, but all she 
had was that one boot so she gave it to me  
and then somebody else 
gave me  a high heeled 
pump, ladies™ shoes. It™s a f
unny story. It was ridiculous, but if you think in terms of the 
situation I found myself in. Oct
ober, which is very, very cold, and you have to stand Œ it™s 
an uphill, and you can stand with bare feet
 because you™ll have pneumonia, plain and 
simple. So, I was like this, one leg up a
nd one leg down. It was funny. We  laughed, but I 
wasn™t cold, and those days were kind 
of very, very bad. There was an underground 
activity already. The Nazi supervisors were 
very aware of some th
ing going on in camp, 
and due to the fact that there were speci
al work details where they employed only 
Christian Poles who were political prisoners, 
they were afraid th
at by leaving them on 
their own, that they would establish a c
ontact with the underground activities, I mean, 

those who were with the underground, and ther
e™s going to be an uprising. This was the 
time when the front was nearing, of course, 
because we were moved to Auschwitz from 
the ghetto to, at the time when the Russian fo
rces were already close to Warsaw, but the 
front didn™t move until later on in the fall, a
nd for this reason, you know, we rema ined in 
Auschwitz. Here, the Nazis were
 afraid of the underground acti
vities, of the Russian front 
approaching and everything, so they came to th
e conclusion that they ought to take and 
break up the Polish work details Œ work units a
nd bring some  Jews in for them not to be 
as comfortable and not to be 
able to do the work that they
 were afraid of, as far as 
uprising. We  were supposed to go to work one morning and the barracks were 

admi nistered by three pe ople. There was a 
Block Älteste
, and there was her assi stant, and 
there was a 
Shreiberin,
 who was a secretary kind of, w
ho was counting the people in the 
morning when they went to work, and counti
ng the people in the evening, and they were 
all old-time rs. Do you know what I mean?  Ol
d-time rs is that they were brought, for 
example, the Czech Œ the two girls, the 
Block Älteste
 and the assistant, was from Slovakia 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
38 
 
and their transport was, I think, the very ea
rly transport, because one of them was so 
horrible. She was so horrible. She was just 
so full of hate for everything and everyone 
that sh
e was just so rude and 
she Œ the Nazis didn™t have the 
Aufsehers,
 who were 
overseeing the work and who were taking, and 
the guards we re taking us to work did not 
have to worry about so much about punishing 
us, because half of the job was done by this 
particular woma n. I me a n, she Œ on the one hand, you know, I can think of her as 
suffering so much for two and a half years prior 
to our arrival or two y
ears, whatever it is, 
and the first group, I think, was 
of 500 wome n and very few su
rvived. So, she must have 
lost everybody who dear and n
ear to her, and therefore, 
you know, she was afflicting all 
her anger and the pain on everybody who was comi ng, and to be tough and rough kind of 

gave her the security of the job indoors. She didn™t have to go to work, and the story that 

I have to read is kind of describi ng of wh
at life was like in one day, because I called it 

ﬁOne Ordinary Day in Auschwitz.ﬂ So, anyhow
 why I™m talking about it is because by 
then this 
Sonderkommando
 had uprising, one of the crematoriums was da ma ged, and the 
Nazis came to the conclusion that most of the gas chambers should Œ no, most of the 

crematoriums should be dismantled because there 
is Œ they don™t Œ I mean, the front is so 
close and they didn™t want to
 leave any evidence. And, this
 woma n who was the secretary 
of the block went with a report to the ma in
 offices, because after each counting in the 
morning and in the evening, she had to repor
t to the headquarters on the amount of the 
people who was in the ba rrack because food wa
s allocated on this basis. And, usually we 
went to work, you know, and we had not seen her. On that particular morning, she 

returned imme diately and she kind of walk
ed over where we  were like nine people 
sleeping in my section, in an upper berth, and 
I was like close to the end, and she pulled 
me  and she says, ﬁTake your two sisters a
nd follow me  and don™t say a word.ﬂ So, I 
mean, she was a Polish gi rl, and when we came t o Auschwitz, she asked us where we are 
from, and I told her, and we had, knew some  
people Œ she had some  friends who came to 

live in our town before the war, and they 
lived in the neighborhood. So, kind of there was 
a little bit of a contact right ther e that  we
 had established. And she says, ﬁDon™t say a 
word. Take your sisters and follow me .ﬂ So, I 
pull my sisters and I say, ﬁLet™s follow.ﬂ 
We follow her and we come  to where the ma in
 office is and there on 
that big square are 
woma n, ma ybe a hundred, well-dressed in good ga
rments, jackets, decent shoes, I me an 
not Œ I mean well-dressed in the sense that
 they had good clothes on. You know, they had 
a warm jacket and a warm skirt or whatev
er and good shoes on, and here we come  in 
shreds, and I come  with the high-heeled s
hoe and a combat boot, what I called it, and 
there was a German and she says like this, ﬁI
 cannot be with you. Go join the group of the 
wome n. The r e is going to be Œ they need
 20 wome n or 22 wome n–ﬂ I don™t reme mber, 
it™s around 20, but 21, 22, it™s not important. ﬁ–to
 work in offices. Reme mber, whatever 
she asks you whether you know, you do know,ﬂ
 and she says, ﬁAnd, Renia™s going to 
stay here with me . And, you go with Hania.ﬂ 
I mean, ﬁThe two of you go.ﬂ That™s what 
she said to us. So, we go and we have 
a dress on. We don™t have any undergarme nts 
whatsoever. In Auschwitz, we did not
 get any undergarments. Whatever 
entlausung
, you 
know we we nt through that, how do you call it, 
entlausung
, the process of getting rid of 
the lice, when they took you to the shower
 room, and they took off your clothes and 
dumped it in a big vat of di
sinfectant water and they dr
ied it some where, I don™t know 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
39 
 
where, and when you came out from the show
er the threw at you a 
garment regardless 
whether it was som
e thing that fits you or
 doesn™t fit you. You know, we were running 
nude through the whole camp to go through to 
that shower room, and then of course, 
fortunately, you know, we ma naged, because we 
used to look at each ot he r and kind of 
whoever was taller has exchanged the dress or
 whatever was thrown at you with a person 
that could wear it. And so in this re
spect, the whole group wa s aware and very 
cooperative; but never undergarme nts. At th
e time, when we came in, we had nothing, 
outright nothing. So, I™m in a dress. I can re
me mber a long cotton dress and these shoes, 
and we are standing with my si
ster. We looked like two set of
 stepsisters, like Cinderella 
next to the stepsisters, who were alwa ys so
 dressed up. And, I think to myself, ﬁHow in 
the world are we going to get a job here? ﬂ  And, that SS ma n who ca me  to look for 

workers walks through the group. He told us 
to line up, you know, and we lined up and I 
was standing next to my sister and he™s as
king my sister what ki
nd of qualifications she 
has for an office job and she speaks German ve
ry well, and she says that she worked in 
the office when we were in camp and Father was working in the

, whenever 
there was no transport and he couldn™t ma na
ge to have all the lists for the following 
morning, one of us always went to assist him so that he could Œ you know, he was not a 

young ma n anymore. I mean, he wa sn™t an 
old ma n, but you know, being alone and so 

forth, it was very difficult. So, we kind of 
were acquainted with office work. So, my 
sister tells him yes, yes, whatever he™s as king her, whether she can
 do this and this, and 
she says yes, yes, and she speaks a very fluent Ge rman, and fine. So, he tells her to go 

here, and he is asking. I just happened to be
 next to her, but there were other wome n 
before her. So, he puts one on this side, one on 
this side, one on this 
side, one on this side. 
Then he says to me , ﬁDo you know how to type on a 
shreibeshim
? ﬂ  Œ on a typewriter. So 
I look at him, and I say, ﬁ
Ich bein eine sehr gute machinenschreiberin
.ﬂ And, whatever. 
And, he looks at me , and he waves to go next
 to Hania. So, I figured okay, whatever™s 
going to happen isn™t going to ma tter, but I™m 
next to my sister and everything is okay. 
And, he goes back and forth, back and forth, ba
ck and forth, back and forth, then he looks 
at our group and he starts
 counting and he says, ﬁ
Genug
.ﬂ And he tells everybody go, and 
we all went, which 
genug
 means enough. So, he counted and we were 20 Œ I don™t know 

20, we were 20 or 25. Whatever we were, but 
this was the number because we were to 

replace 25 Polish political pris
oners in that work group that was dealing only with 
property that was brought to camp by polit
ical prisoners. The political prisoners™ 
property, whether it was a dress a sweater a 
hairpin, when they were taken, put in 
Auschwitz concentration camp and given a unifo rm, every little item they brought with 

them had to be registered and stored, so in 
case they were transferre
d to a different camp, 
that each and every item had to follow themor, if they died, that their property was 

returned to the fa mily. So, they had to keep
 a very close account of the property of the 
wome n political Polish prisoners. Wh ile the 
property of the Jews who were brought to 
camp, to Auschwitz, was confiscated, and the goo
d things were stored in Kanada, which 
was this unit known, you know, where they stored the stuff, and selected the good things 

to be sent to the Reich, including all valuable s and everything, and the 
rest of the things 
were distributed to the prisoners, you know, wh
en they ran out of uniforms. So, we a r e 
there and he™s just about to ma rch us off, 
and I know already but we are qualified for the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396

job. Now, the job is not anymore where we 
have been. The job is all together in a 
different area and very close to Kanada and we are being m
a rched out some where else, 
and my sister Renia is not with us. And, then
 I see fellows standing 
in the back with my 
sister Renia, and the 
Block Älteste
, the woma n who was in charge of the block, and they 
kind of push my sister Re nia and the 
Block Älteste
 come s running with her and she says 
to the ma n who was selecting the people for 
work, she says, ﬁPleas
e take her with you. 
Her two sisters are there, and she can ma ke a very good 
Lieferant
 (ph) ﬂ A
 Lieferant
 (ph) 
due to the fact that there were no phones 
in camp, only the headquarters had phones, any 
me ssages that had to be carried between ba
rracks were done by people who were the so-
called runners between the - how do you say th
at?  Œ those who, that ma de it possible for 
the barracks to communi cate with the ma in o
ffice and other departme nts. But, ﬁShe™s a 
very good 
Lieferant
 (ph),ﬂ and he looks at her and he
 sees the pathetic
-looking thing and 
he looks at us, and he says, ﬁOkay.ﬂ And, he
 pounds and he ma rches us off. Now, we are 
comi ng to the new place to work, and there is no room for us yet because the other 

wome n whom we are replacing are still there. 
They have not been transported to another 
place and it is their job to acquaint us with the 
work that they have been doing. So, as we 
were entering, the girl who stood guard to the entrance of Kanada, a little girl whose 

name  was Fela (ph), she saw the difference 
be tween the ot her wome n, the way what they 
looked like, and us, and she knew that this 
is like, you know, like some thing non-existent, 
because the people who worked in Kanada, 
they have access to 
food because the food 
was brought with the transport. So, it™s not r
eally that Œ it was confiscated. It was taken 
out of the trains. It was brought to Ka nada
, anyhow. So, they ha
d good clothes and they 
had Œ so, as we were walking by she says, at
 break, she says, ﬁYou come  to me . I™ve got 
to see you.ﬂ So, we nodded our heads and we 
said, ﬁFine. We  are going to come .ﬂ You 
know, in a situation like this, when you s
ee that some body wa nts to see you, you knew 
that some body wants to see you for a different
 reason, for an important one, let™s put it 
this way. So, at break, we went to the barracks and by then, she had a whole crew waiting 

for us. She had good coats, painted with a 
red stripe , because if you didn™t have a 
uniform, a striped uniform, you had a red stripe
 painted on the back. So, they took us like 
to a little enclosure. There 
were four wome n. I never saw th
em in my life including that 
little girl who stood at the ga
te. They dressed us with ev
erything, panties and bras and 
socks and shoes and skirts and jackets, took o
ff our numbers fr om the tattered clothes and 
put them on the new jacket, because we had to 
return back to the barracks that same day. 
There was no room for us to stay here. We ll,
 we worked all day. We  got acquainted with 
the job. It wa s a job inside, office work, ﬁo
fficeﬂ quote, unquote, but
 still it was indoors, 
and working indoors ma de a great deal of a diffe
rence, and we  went back to the barracks, 

to the original barracks to the group from
 Starachowice, and when we came in nobody 
could recognize us, nobody. Because we looked so
 different. We had all these clot hes and 
everything. So, you know what we did?  We  undr
essed and we  shared our clothes. Mind 
you, three people Œ everybody had some thing di
fferent of a differe
nt size. We  took 
everything that we had on and gave it Œ sh
ared it with the people who were in the 
barracks because we knew that we are going back
 the next morning and the girls told us, 
ﬁDon™t be afraid to leave thos
e things to anyone you want t
o. We™ll have new things for 
you tomorrow.ﬂ They didn™t know that we were going to be back and forth, but they 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
41 
 
knew that for one week, we™ll be moving 
around because it wa s a small area, you know, 
it was kind of a camp that was pretty m
uch se
parated from the rest of the camp, and they 
knew that it would take about
 a week before the other wome n who were training us for 
the job will leave. So, that was such a blessi
ng because within this week, in the morning, 
we were leaving the barracks in the worst 
clot hes there was, and comi ng back in the 

evening, and we went through the same  routine every day. And, you know, it was just the 

most wonderful thing. We didn™t help muc
h. The group was, I don™t know how ma ny we 
were, about 200, and you can do just so mu
ch, but some body has gotten some thing, you 
know, that was helpful, and that was the most
 wonderful thing. There you are. Here is a 
woma n that we don™t know, that was a kind 
of a, you know, an acquaintance that you run 

into, and just a conversation with a person th
at you know some  people that she knows or 
that she was fond of who were from her homet
own, and that was all. I mean it was not a 
friendship of any kind. She was not even willi
ng to show any kind of friendly association 
because, in order for her to keep her job, she wa
s a barker is what I call he r. She never hit 
anybody like the other one, but she barked. 
She was yelling and yelling and calling you 
the worse name s in the world, but this is about
 the extent of her being tough. This was her 
toughness, and when she had this opportunit
y, mind you, and to be there and then to go 
and bring the 
Block Älteste
 to ma ke sure that Renia™s goi
ng to get in with us, a mi racle, 
that™s my mother watching over us, and I™m
 not kidding, because after the war when I 
returned back to Poland and I went to see 
my home town to fi nd out if there is anybody 
left from the  fa mily Œ because peop
le were comi ng, ma ybe some body was seeing, 
some body had, and there were about twenty Jews who had come  back and settled back in 

their homes in one area, but 
the Paliszewski fami ly, with 
whom my parents were so 
friendly, with whom we had kind of always a 
home  a way from home , 
insisted that since 
they didn™t see us for such a long time, that 
we can stay a whole day with the people, but 
for the night we should come  to them and 
we should spend the night with them and 
they™ll give us an opportunity to talk and, one
 of the wome n, I had a picture of her with 
me  when I went back to Poland, you know, whe n 
we went to Treblinka, she went with us. 
That was in fact a finding mi ssion in 1979. She 
said to us in 1945 Œ I was with my sister 
Hania in their home and I sat around and I coul
d see the Christma s tree, the corner where 
the Christmas tree was and all the presents 
that they prepared for us. You know, they 
didn™t have small children, so, you know, that whole fun of the holiday, we were their 

children. So, it was kind of comi ng back, and sh
e says to me , ﬁI want you to reme mber 
my children. Two days before the liquidati
on of the ghetto, your mother was here. She 
brought with her your Pa ssover silver, and 
your Passover wine cups, and she said, ‚I 

know that I cannot burden you with any prope
rty, but if you don™t mi nd, I would like you 
to hold them. I know that we have almost no 
chance to survive, but I am willing to give 
my life with the knowledge that my thr
ee gi rls will survive the war.ﬂ And, you know, 
since what we had in 1945, right 
after the war, and I feel that
 all the difficult situations 
that we went through, in mome nts where we 
really felt that it™s the end, we  reached a 

point of no return, that it was 
really my mother who was wa
tching over us. It™s a mi racle 
how three young girls, with such a difference 
in age between the ol
dest and the youngest, 
could hold on and go through the same  period, and 
yet survive. So, I f
eel that it™s not only 
that, you know, some  people say divine provide
nce. I believe in divine providence, you 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
42 
 
know?  But at the same  time, I also feel that 
these last words that the Paliszewski™s who 
were her friends had heard from her were so true, and the m
o ther went down and she 
brought me  the silver and the wine cups, the Pa
ssover wine cups that 
I still have. This is 
the only thing I have from home , be cause ever
ything else that was placed with different 
people are gone, and thing, you know, there were 
some  things that they had taken that 
were not such a tremendous responsibility. They
 didn™t want to take
 anything of value, 
because they figured in case they are compe
lled to leave their home, they shouldn™t have 
this obligation to worry about our property. S
o, the warm sweaters and the coats that we 
left with them because, once we went to work
 and we were comi ng back to the ghetto, we 
me t with Polish people at work, and if we
 knew people who were willing to take a 
me ssage to them, they have seen to it that 
some thing was sent to us, even in this slave 
labor camp i n Starachowice, even after th
e ghetto, you know. Even, they could, whatever 
they could afford to send us and assist us in any wa y they were very, very helpful. But 

you had to have willing people who took the me ssa
ge to them, and trust them so that they 
would not endanger the safety of the fa mil
y. So, you had to be very, very careful, and 
that™s the way it is. But that very ni ght when we
 were in Starachowice, let me  finish this Œ 

is there were about 20 Jews and five children who survived Auschwitz from my 

home town, and they were comi ng back to town
, and in the mi ddle of the night a group of 

radical Poles, and there were ma ny of them in
 t his particular region, the NSZ, the most 
radical, not Comm
unist, but fascist group in Starachowi
ce, attacked that community, that 
little group of people who were there, and two 
of those children that survived Auschwitz 
were killed that night, two adults, I think 
Œ I don™t reme mber exactly. I know that there is 
a record ma de of the amount of people who we
re injured, even with the name s, I didn™t 
commend it to my me mory, just recollecting. I 
know that there were
 five children who 
survived Auschwitz and two of
 them were killed that ve
ry night. That was June 1945. 
And then they came knocking at the door at
 the Pa liszewski™s house, and they said, 
ﬁOpen the door.ﬂ It was like 
two o™clock in the morning. And they said, ﬁWe know that 
the Laks sisters are here with you, and we 
want them.ﬂ And, the lady of the house, who 
was in the other bedroom, and Œ because the friends were basically her young daughters, 

she was a widow by then Œ walked over tothe door and she said, ﬁHow dare you to 

disturb my sleep. Yes, they are with me , but
 as long as they™re under my roof you are not 
going to lay your hands on them, 
and please leave us alone.ﬂ 
You know, they were a very 
respected family. I mean, they weren™t just 
anybody. They were a very respected family. 
So, it was quiet and we didn™t know what 
happened. We  just knew that some body was 
knocking in the mi ddle night, dema nding that we are, so to say, given to for whatever 

reason they wanted us. And, the following 
morning, one of the young wome n, before she 
went to work, went to find out what happene
d that night, and she came running back. She 
was like a ghost, as pale as a ghost, and sh
e says, ﬁGirls, please
 don™t leave the house, 
just stay here. There is some thing terrible
 that has happened, and the people who were 
here looking for you have attacked that sma
ll group of Jews.ﬂ A
nd, she didn™t have the 
exact number or anything, but ﬁthere are people
 and children killed, a
nd just stay until the 
situation clears.ﬂ And, we stayed there for 
the whole day, and in the evening, when she 
came back from work Œ they lived also very cl
ose to the railroad st
ation, within walking 
distance. It wasn™t that far away. She came Œin a small town everything is close. So, she 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
43 
 
came from work and she went straight to th
e station and she bought tickets for us to go 
back to Lodz because w
e just came for the 
day to find out what™s happening, and for the 
train, she knew exactly when the train will be  comi ng, and she asked the ma n who was Œ 
the head of 
Doroszka
. You know what the 
Doroszka
 is?  It™s like a horse and buggy that 
you put the hood up to protect himself from Œ 
like in Central Park they have those 
buggies Œ and she placed us, when we heard the 
whistle of the train in the distance Œ she 
took us into 
Doroszka
, covered up, took us to the train station was when the train was 
already standing on the track, put us in the 
trai n, and was waiting there until the mo me nt 
the train started to move, to ascertain that we
 are safe, and that we can live in safety. And 
this is how I left Starachowice, and promised
 my self never to retu
rn. It™s again, we are 
talking about things that we
 are jumping back and forth, but it™s– I don™t know. I think 
that talking about the things th at are very important at certain
 particular mome nts is better 
then to kind of go in a chronological order th
at I ma y forget later 
on to speak about it. 
And, by the way, that job lasted from the e
nd of October and until the middle of January, 
which was two and a half months, and that wa
s two and a half months in an environment 
that was working under the roof, in the comp
any of very intellig
ent Polish wome n, and 
after the war, I found out that 50 percent 
were Jews, Jewish woma n under assume d 
Christian name s, that showed you concern and care and shared with you the packages 

they were getting from home  and created, 
not only a home environment for you, but a 
kind of an intellectual environment, as well,
 where after work, because we were a small 
group of 50, it must have been 25 wome n, because we were a small group of 50, we 

didn™t have to stand and 
Zählappel. 
Everything was right there 
within this unit, which 
was separate and apart from anything that
 was going on in Auschwitz. We  were only 
responsible for clothes and 
the suitcases and the pocket
books and everything that was 
brought by the Polish political prisons. So, in 
the evening, we used to sit and discuss and 
talk and sing and kind of create
 a kind of a lighter situation, 
and also having a little extra 
food and not being outdoors working in Nove
mbe r  and December, when conditions we re 

horrible, outright horrible, or be transpor
ted like everybody else to another camp at the 
time, you know, they were mostly transporting 
people to different camps, and us they 
kept until the very last mome nts when the 
liquidating completely, abandoning Auschwitz. 
So, in a way those two and a half mo nths gave
 us self-esteem, brought 
us back to kind of 
a little bit of a normal life. 
We  had a little bit of extra 
food, and we had this group of 
wome n who were not as– desperate. I mean, th
ey were political prisoners, they suffered. 
They suffered. They were not treated, you know, 
a lot better than the Jews, but the me re 
fact that we didn™t have to go with the co
mmand and morning count, and we didn™t have 
the dogs, and we didn™t have the Œ no, the SS th
at led us to work, no Œ the soldiers who 
were watching us, you know, and we didn™t walk 
in the rain, and we didn™t stand in the 
rain Œ that whole combination kind of gave 
us an opportunity to kind of become  huma n 
again. Huma n in a sense that if you regained 
a little bit of your se
lf-esteem, because you 
were not beaten, and you were treated lik
e an equal and you were
 not called those 
horrible name s that sounded so terrible for a 15-year-old person, to be beaten and be 

called a whore and stuff like this, that I woul
dn™t even have dared to bring it out in the 
presence of my parents, expressions like this
, and this is what was, so to say, a daily 
routine. So, this kind of a thing was really a turning point th
at prepared us for the death 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
44 
 
ma rch and then for all these next six months
 that were not so good, but on the other hand, 
they were not so terrible that we gave
 up hope. So, you know, it™s like a good month and 
a bad m
onth, and a good period and a bad period, and if you combine it all together and 
you have this support, so to say, of some one that loves you and you love them and you 
are aware of the fact that you have to help each
 other, I think that this is a secret of 
survival. 
 

Q: I don™t know how long we have. I have afeeling that ma ybe we should stop here. 

 

A: That will be fi ne. 

 

Q: And go back when we meet again. Do you real
ly want m
e
 to continue with the came ra?  
 

A: It™s fine. Whatever you want. If you feel 
that it is good to con
tinue and wo
rthwhile. 
 

Q: No, I think it™s important– 

 

A: I™ll make myself availabl e. 

 

Q: –that we continue and start again with the 
liquidation of the ghetto, especially given the 
story you™ve told about your 
sense of your mother and what
 you learned about what she 
said. W
e  need to go back there and know wh
at happened and what that break, which was 
really significant for 
all of you, cause that really changed everything. 
 
A: So, you want to do it right now?  
 

Q: No, no, we won™t do it now. I think that when
 we meet again, that™s where we™ll begin. 
Thank you very m
uch. 
 

A: All right. Thank you.

Tape #5
 
 
Q: Good morning again, Chris. We lcome back to Washington. 

 

A: Goodmorning. 

 

Q: What I™d like us to do is start with your
 Œ a few months before the liquidation of the 
ghetto. Somebody had escaped from Treblinka and came back. Can you talk about w
hat 
happened?  
 

A: Yes, of course. That was 
about in the summer of 1942 when 
transports to Treblinka were 
being sent en m
a sse from Wa rsaw ghetto. They
 just started the evacu
ation of ghettos, and 
I think it was Warsaw that was the first one Œ 
the first transport. It was like, I would say, 
September Œ not September, but August 1942, 
when on one afternoon, we were sitting in 
the backyard with some  friends talking, spe
nding some  ti me  together, when all of a 
sudden out of the bushes, a young ma n appeared
 and he was very disheveled. He was 
unshaven and he was filthy, and he was very, 
very frightened. And when he saw us, he 
wasn™t quite certain whether he should come out or not, but when he saw us, he some how 

dared to come  out and say, ﬁ
Amhat
ﬂ (ph). 
Amhat
 was like a password at the time for 
ma king sure that the people you™
re encounter are also
 Jews. Actually, we used to say not 
amhat
, but 
amhut
, with a ﬁuﬂ. I mean like, and of course, we answered imme diately 
ﬁ
Amhut
ﬂ to him, and this kind of got him a littl
e relaxed, but he was still, very, very 
nervous and he was just so 
strange looking. We  had never seen anybody in this kind of a 
condition. We asked him who he was and he starte
d to tell us this story how he came  with 
his parents to Treblinka, how they were br
ought on the transport to Tr eblinka, and how 
his parents were separated from hi m imme diat
ely upon arrival, how he was put to work to 
unload the belongings of the people that were 
brought to camp, and how he realized that 
that was the end of the road, so to say, 
that it was an extermination camp. So, he 
some how managed after the work to get under 
a cattle car and he su
spended himself, I 
mean, he we nt under the cattle car, got a hold of
 the axis Œ whatever Œ and when the train 
started to roll out, because th
e  tr a i ns  we r e  br i n gi ng i n  pe
ople, unloading and leaving the 
camp site, going back for more transport, he 
got himself under the car
 and held on to the 
chassis and when he realized
 that the train was already 
out of the camp compound, that 
he dropped to the ground. It was already ev
ening, and he remained
 lying there on the 
tracks for a while to ascertain that nobody 
was around, that he was not going to be 
pursued and he walked to the woods near
by, not knowing exactly where he was and 
which direction to take, and he
 just walked, and he walked 
mostly at night because during 
the day he wa s frightened. He didn™t know r
eally, you know, what kind of a situation he 
ma y be confronted with. Therefore, he walk
ed at night which was 
very difficult for him 
to know exactly where he was going, but it di
dn™t really ma tter. All he wanted was to 

escape, and it was, like, on the second day or 
the third day that he came to us and he was 

very hungry and very thirsty and he asked 
for some food. We sat 
there, you know, we 
were teenagers, and we watche
d him, and he hims elf wasn™t 
much older. He must have 
been seventeen or eighteen years old, and 
he had that wild look on him, you know. We 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
46 
 
knew some thing shocking Œ he mus t  have 
gone through something very, very shocking. 
So, we went home
 and entered the house, and 
we told my parents that there is a guy there 
who acts like crazy, and he™s te
lling us stories that we just
 don™t believe. So, my parents 
came out and asked him to come  in, and he sat down. They gave him some food to eat 
and then they started a convers
ation, and once he got into details my parents told us to 
leave. Most likely, they didn™t 
want us to be aware or know 
exactly the details that were 
taking pl ace, you know, in camps like Treblinka . So, I would say that after this encounter 

we kind of began to realize that some thing is
 happening, that inasmuch as living in the 
ghetto was so different from the normal life th
at we  led before, and being forced to work 
in factories was also some th
ing that we have never plan
ned on doing, especially forced 
labor. There was another aspect to our lives 
that was unpredictable 
that ma y come  i nto 
the picture soon, and of course, within a few 
mo nths which was from August to October, 
our town has gone through the same  thing. The Nazis came  to liquidate our ghetto in 

Starachowice; that was in October of 1942. 
 

Q: Can I ask you some thing?  Did your parents as
k all three of you to leave, all three sisters 
or did Renia stay also?
 
 

A: 
I don™t remember, because we were basi
cally– We™re friends. You know, like you live 
in a neighborhood so, it™s summertim
e and 
you are confined always to the small 
apartment. You like to be outdoors especially
 in the summer time. 
You need it and you 
want to be with your friends. So, we were 
like a bunch of kids, I don™
t know six or seven. 
I don™t know whether both of my si
sters were there, one of my 
sisters was there, but this 
is what happened at the time , and this is 
how we came to know that there is a camp, an 
extermination camp, at Treblinka where they are gassing Jews. 
 

Q: Do you have any recollection that when your  parents asked you to
 leave the house, you 
had said to your parents we don™t beli
eve him. You knew som
e thing had happened 
because of how he was acting, because he wa
s so strange, right?  But given that they 
asked you to leave, do you have any recoll
ection of when they asked you, you thought, 
ﬁ Well, maybe this is really tr
ueﬂ? Did you talk to each other?  
 

A: We kind of sensed some thing, but you really
 don™t want to believe it, and it™s ma
ybe, you 
know, a ma ture mi nd can comprehend much 
better then a young person. And sometimes 
in a lot of cases, even grown ups didn™t want
 to believe. People some time s  would say, 
ﬁ Well, it must have been such a shocking e
xperience for an individual to be separated 
from his parents, not knowing where they are 
or what has happened to them that all of a 
sudden they lose their mi nd.ﬂ So, you can™t rea
lly tell. To us, the story was very, very 
strange. You know, whe n you believe in humanity and you believe in goodness and you 

are brought in a way that you have to conduct 
yourself properly and behave in a certain 
way, those things are unbelieva ble because things like this we re never done before, even 

if you grew up in an envi ronment that was anti-Semitic does not me an that you were 

being murdered. There hasn™t been such a thi
ng before. So, considering that we were all 
too young yet, one on hand it seemed crazy on the other hand, it was very real, because

the manner he ate that potato that was gi
ven to him Œ I m
ean, we shared with him 
whatever we had Œ that he was gulping
 it down. You could see how hungry he was. 
 
Q: The day of the liquidation of the ghett
o, do you reme
mber what kind of a day it was?  
Was it cold? Was the sun shining?  
 

A: This, too, has been a different experience 
for me
 and my olde r sister than for anybody 
else because, as I said before, we were worki
ng in a factory and that
 was the brick factory 
that we were working. Usually, there were tw
o shifts, so it was a twelve hour working 
shift, and that very day, we left for work fo
r the night shift. So, actually what happened is 
that like the day before, we left home, and 
went to work without knowing that that was 
the last time  that we were together as fa mil
y, that it was the last time that we had seen our 
mother, and it was the last time that we functi
oned as a family unit, because the night of Œ 
while we were in the factory, SS groups with 
collaborators from Œ they were uniformed 
Latvian soldiers Œ came  to liquidate the 
ghetto. They took all the people out, chased 
everybody out of their home s into the ma rketpl
ace, and there was a selection. The people 
who had e mployment cards were put to one 
side. People who were without employme nt 
cards Œ children, and elderly and mothers Œ they
 were put to another 
side, and they were 
beaten, of course, and those who rema ined in
 their homes who refused to leave the house 
were shot to death either in their beds
 or at home. So, everybody was out in the 

ma rketplace in the mi ddle of the night, and my
 sister and myself were at work in the 
factory. So, actually only Renia 
andboth of my parents were
 there while the action took 
place. So, the details that I know
 of what has happened at the time ca me fr om my sister 
Renia and from my father. The repl acement for 
the shift on which we were did not arrive 
in the morning to the fact ory because they were still segregating people. Therefore, we 

had to rema in in the factory for another twel
ve hours of work. So, we worked that day a 
double shift, and we didn™t know what happened.
 We  just couldn™t understand, and in the 
morning, the factory was like on the ground fl
oor, and on the upper levels were offices, 
and in one of the Œ in the office there was 
a school friend of mi ne, a Christian, a Pole, 

who lived not far in the neighborhood and he 
knew the Jews are working two shifts. He 
didn™t know who was at work, and he came a little earlier and he came down and he says, 

ﬁSomething horrible happened in town. They 
are taking away the Jews.ﬂ And, he looked 
and when I saw him, I walked over and I said, ﬁTell me  what happened.ﬂ So, he says, 

ﬁCome up to the window upstairs and you will see it by yourself.ﬂ The window was 

facing a railroad siding from where the cattle 
cars where standing and where the people 
were brought from the marketpl ace, and of c
ourse, it was such a shock, when I looked out 
the window, that I will never forget it because
 the people were crying, they were beaten, 

they were chased. You could see mothers, 
you know, holding their babies. You could see 
me n carrying bundles on their backs, and for th
at fleeting mome nt, fo
r that mi nute or two, 
whatever, because I didn™t want to je
opardize his job, and he for sure, you know, 
wouldn™t want to anyone to rea
lize that he ma de it possible for me  to come and look out 
the window. So, for that one mo ment, all I 
could see was like a ch
ain of huma n bodies 
moving in one direction, you know, beaten and 
pushed into the cars, and I was trying so 
hard to look and see whether I see a familiar f
ace, I couldn™t see anythi ng. I just couldn™t 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
48 
 
see, whether it was because I was so shocked, 
or because I was Œ I me
an, it was too far of 
a distance for me to see, but just a feeling 
of that ma ss of people being driven and being 
pushed into the cars and listen to the crie
s and the moaning and it was horrible. I came 
back to work Œ you know, we worked the conveyor, like a conveyor where we were 
placing wet bricks on the conveyor
 belt and they were sent to
 the kiln upstairs Œ and I 
knew that some thing has taken place. I only hope
 that whatever has taken pl ace, that it 
will bring us back together. That was the mo
rning. We ca me after work, they never took 
us back to the ghetto. They took us to the 
camp in Majowka, and there we found Father, 
and we found Renia, and Mother was not
 around. They just couldn™t find Mother 
anywhere. But Mother was employed in an electric plant, which at the time had it™s own 

facility, like a li
ttle small barracks for the people who 
worked around there. So, we were 
hoping that, due to the fact that this was he
r place of e mployment, that she could have 
been taken to the other facility, and it t
ook a whole week to inquire. You know, it wasn™t 

so easy to ma ke contact. It took a whole w
eek to inquire who was sent where, you know, 
which camp, because there were three camps. 
There were the camps Strzelnica and then 
Majowka, and this was the electric plan
t, which eventually, you know, they took the 
people from the electric plant and brought them
 to one of the two camps. And we found 
out that Mother wasn™t around. 
And talking to people afterwar
ds, trying to find out what 
happened to Mother, we were told that she 
had a friend who was a widow and she was all 
by herself, and she got ve ry hysterical b
ecause she had nobody and she was so lost, and 
Mother kept her company and she tried to keep her calm, and she told her ﬁDon™t worry, 

I™m with you. I™m with you; I™m going to take 
care of you.ﬂ So, she took care of her and 

they both we nt to Treblinka, just to show th
at she died the way she did, trying to help 
other people. This was 1942. So, she was the first victim in the fa mily, so to say, and I 
have difficulties to kind of understand 
why a person who has done so muc h good for 
others has been taken away from us , and sh
e was the first victim. We came to the camp. 
Of course, the group was not sent imme di
ately to the camp. We had to go through 
inspection. They had to check what we had on us
. Not that we  carried a lot to work with 
us, but due to the fact that my parents me t that young me n at the time , M other insisted, 
especially since it was ge tting a 
little colder, that we wear 
three outer layers of clothes 
and good shoes that we have a good coat when we go to work because normally, she 

wouldn™t have even thought about
 it. So, we ca me  in and, of
 course, whatever we had, a 
watch or whatever, a little ri
ng, or whatever Œ what does a 
teenager have? Œ it was taken 
away from us, and we remained with the clot
hes at least we had, some  extra clothes to 

wear and we had good shoes on our feet. So, th
ey took away the valuables from us and 
they placed us in different
, different, in the barracks. There was barracks for me n and 
there were barracks for wome n, and then the following day, they separated the group, 

because the people who worked in the munition 
factories went  to the camp at Strzelnica, 
which was much closer to the factory, while th
e rest of us went to Majowka, which was a 
larger camp, and from there people were sent
 to ma ny different places of employme nt, 
whether they needed in the steel mill, whet
her they were needed in the brick factory 
where I was in the beginning or whether in the 
electric plant or wherever. So, this is Œ we 

were separated. Father and I had rema ined in 
Majowka, and Hania and Renia were sent to 
Strzelnica, and as I me ntioned to you that due
 to the fact that Fa
ther was running that 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
49 
 
employment offi ce in the ghetto, he was put in
 ch
arge because he was familiar with the 
work in Majowka, and Hania was assigned the 
same  job in Strzelni ca. Wh atever  Father 
was doing in Majowka, she was running the o
ffice there and the work usually Œ I mean, 
the assi gnment of the work came from the Je
wish ma nageme nt, came from the Judenrat 
which was very, very he lpful because at least, you know, we had more contact with her, 
and it was easier to maintain the contact be
tween one camp site and 
the other. So, that 
was the liquidation of the ghetto. It wa s such a 
sad sight. I must have 
been at the window 
for a mi nute or ma ybe for two, but to just
 watch that like moving bodies, you know, a 

group, a chain, an unending chain, and we were
 Œ I don™t know whether we were five 
thousand Jews, or - usually it was like ten 
percent of the population in a small town like 
ours was Jewish Œ and Wi erzbnik and Star
achowice were two communities, separate 

communities until the consolidation. So, Wi erzbnik was predominately Jewish, and I 

would say that there must have been, I don™t 
know, at least five thousand Jews living in 
the community. Fortunately, because of the 
need for employment and the Jews were 
working free of charge, you know. There was 
no pay or no compensation whatsoever for 
work. We  were ma gnificent cheap labor force,  that a lot of people were saved from Œ 

especially those who were young and able to wor
k, and survived due to the fact that from 
1942 until 1944, until the time when they took us
 to Auschwitz, that we were working. 
And of course, the me re fact that you liv
ed in the same  comm
unity and that you knew 
people, Christians and in some  cases, Christ
ians who were willing 
to assist you on their 
very own, and in some  cases, Christians with 
whom some  people left valuables, and they 

were kind of disposing of the valuables and 
helping and sending to the people some  extra 
food or some clothes or
 whatever they needed. So, that
 was very helpful because those 
people Œ those Jews were brought from large Lo
dz or from Plotsk or from the other 
places, in the beginning to our ghetto, they
 had nobody to assist them. They had nobody 
to help them. They were tota
l strangers and they depended on
 the assi stance of the Jewish 
community, but once the Jewish community was decima ted, they didn™t have anyone to 

turn to.  
 

Q: Can I ask you some thing?  

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Because I think people Œ I think it would 
be very
 interesting for people to understand 
what it was like to try and 
find out what happened to your mother. Do you rem
e mber who 
told you?  Did your father te
ll you?  Was your father the one
 who actually found out? Or 
did all four of you–?  
 

A: No, Father was Œ Father definitely, Father
 was the one who found out. I mean, I could see 
Œ I could see how terribly, how he fe
lt, how
 terribly affected he
 was by the loss of 
Mother, and due to the fact that we we
ren™t there, you know, some ti me s I thought to 
myself, ﬁIf we only would be there.ﬂ Becau
se when you sepa rate me n fr om wome n, and 
you go through a selection, I can™t
 imagine that Re nia wasn™t of much help to Mother, 

and she kind of depended on Mother to take 
care of her, and Mother was taking care of 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
50 
 
her friend, and Father wa sn™t even there 
to know what was happening, and I don™t even 
know in what way Renia ma
naged to be later on in camp. I don™t know, and she never 
told me . I don™t even know how this happene
d. I mean, it isn™t like that Father was 
holding on to her and brought her with him. 
 

Q: Because he wasn™t there? 

 

A: I mean, he was there, but he was on oneside of the ma rketplace 
with the m
en, and the 
wom
e n wer e  on the other side. So, every once in 
a while when I think about it, I feel that 
maybe if we were ther e with 
Hania, we kind of could have 
managed to get her with us. I 
think so. I don™t know whether it was destiny.I don™t know whether it was just meant to 

be that way. 
 

Q: Did you get very depressed when you h
eard this?  Did you get 
anguished?
 Did you...?  
 

A: Of course, we mi ssed her. And every time I thin
k about it, I always see it in one way: that 
I never said goodbye to my mother. Whether 
I w
a s anguished, I don™t know. We  wer e  Œ 
we had to get up in the morning and go to work, and when we came back from work, we 

had Œ we just had to have a meal and go to sl
eep and we were lucky to have a parent, and 
in one way or another, in the beginning, I di
dn™t give up hope. Some how in the back of 
my mi nd, I was hoping that, no ma tter what, that
 Mother is going to some how appear. 
We all knew Œ we all knew that what is happe
ning when people are taken away from the 
ghettos. We  all knew, but when it come s to 
some one who is dear and you love dearly, 
you have hopes that it™s not Œ they did not Œ th
is kind of thing could 
not have happened to 
your parent or your sibling or
 whoever. That ma ybe by some  chance they wound up in a 
camp some where and maybe after the war you w
ill be reunited. From what we heard, is 
that she was put on the trai
n with her friend, and everybody 
knew that the train went 
straight to Treblinka. So, inasmuch as, on 
the one hand, we knew what has happened, on 
the other hand, in my own mi nd, 
I was still hoping that a good person like her deserves to 
live. 
 

Q: So, by that time, Treblinka meant some thing like what this person was telling you?  

 

A: By that time , Treblinka  rema ined a reality.I mean, it became  a  reality. We  knew that this 
is the end of the road.  
 

Q: One of the reasons why I ask you that que
stion is because, w
hen people in ordinary 
circum
stances in norma l life lose some body, the  
time of the funeral and the mourning is a 
time when Œ people need a certain kind of time. But in traumatic situations and in 

situations like you were in, there 
is no time. So, there is no space. 
 

A: There is no time . There is no space. There is 
no assurance that this is what happened, and 
that it happened when it did happen. But one 
thing was certain: when the war was over 
and the people who survived from
 the community
 got together and they kind of gathered 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
51 
 
all the information that was available,
 everybody knew that the transport from 
Starachowice wound up in Treblinka. Treblin
ka nowadays is a very kind of very 
awesom
e pl ace where you don™t have  any barracks, and you don™t have any 
crematoriums. It™s just  an architectural artistic, ar chitect urally interpretation which 

received the prize from the Polish governme nt
, and what it consists of is huge rocks and 
little rocks that are supposed to represen
t communities from which the people were 
brought for extermination, and there is a huge
, huge stone Œ not a 
granite stone, but a 
whatever the stone is, with the carved na
me  on it ﬁStarachowiceﬂ and it™s huge. It™s 
almost up to my shoulder. And every time I goto, to Poland, I make my way to Treblinka 

with a little fl ower. That st
one is the only thing that I ha
ve to reme mber Mother, just 
reme mber her and reme mber the people 
who, our neighbors and our friends and 
everybody else who lived around and found the sa
me  fate as she did. So, you have to 
ma ke peace and you have to go on living. It™s really tragic because it™s not only my 

mother, but think of all the wonderful people 
who lived in the commun
ity and think of all 
the little children and they did not survive 
the war because of the Nazi ma dness. [pause] 
Then, of course, we had to be confronted w
ith another thing. We went to work every day 
just like before, but the living conditions were
 different. As long as we were in the ghetto, 
we had a family life, not as comfortable as be
fore, but still in all we were a fa mily unit 
and that was very, very important. He re, 
we were separated. My two sisters were 
some where else, and I was with my father so
me where else. We ma intained our contact, 
which was wonderful, and due to the fact that, 
as I said before, we were in our hometown 
and we knew the people who were involved, w ho were assigned to different jobs, you 

know, in admi nistrating the camp, but if anythi
ng we needed very badly; they were 

always cooperating. But, life 
was all together different. We
 lived in barracks. The food 
was prepared in the kitchen. So, we had to ha
ve the meal whenever it was available. We 
didn™t starve, not like in Ausc
hwitz, but we certainly get 
enough food, but in comparison 
with Auschwitz, the slave labor camp, was 
mu ch, much be tter and you kind of have to 
accept whatever the situation was like.  
 

Q: Where did you eat? In the barracks, or –?  

 

A: No, there was like a me ss hall near where the kitchen facility was, and they were 
preparing meals for people as they were
 com
i
ng and leaving for work, you know?  So, 
there was an advantage to that because Father
 was always waiting for me  to return from 
work so we could have a meal together. In
asmuch there was separate area where the 

barracks for me n were situated and the wome
n we re, it™s still, you know, meals we could 
have together. At the time, the camp, the N
azi commandants who were in charge of the 
camps, were changing all the time. I don™t 
know why, whether it was due to the war 
effort, or whether they we re sent out to the 
front, or due to the fact
 it kind of was tied in 
with the munition factories, and depending on 
the job that they had to do, you know, that 
they were also in charge of the camp. We  were guarded by Ukrainians, and the camp, 

inasmuch as it was a labor camp, wa s also fenced in and we had watchtowers, and the 

Ukrainian guards were in the watchtowers. 
We  were led to work always guarded by the 
Ukrainians and brought back from the  work. 
If the distance was a very long distance, 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
52 
 
then they put us on trucks, and they took us to work. Otherwise, they ma rched us to work. 
Some
times, the camp commandant was a kinder 
individual. Some times, it was a vicious 
individual. And in 1943, spring of 1943, a typhu
s epidemic broke out in the camp, and 
people got very, very sick, and they lost a 
lot of people. They 
didn™t have enough people 
to send to the factories. Inasmuch as they
 were bringing more people from different 
smaller plants that they were liquidating. A
nd I reme mber one day, Hania was with Renia 
in Strzelnica, and I was with my
 father and the epidemic broke
 out first in Strzelnica, and 
both of my s i sters took sick, but Renia wa
s first. And when the camp commandant, who 
was at the time , his na me was Meir, and th
ere was an ubershtopfuhrer (ph), who was over 
this camp commandant. His name  was Aldoph, ca
me  in one day to Strzelnica, and they 
told everybody to leave the barracks, and w
hoever rema ined in the beds, they were 
walking with machine guns, both of them, a
nd shooting people who did not live the beds 
because they were not able to get up. And th
e rest , they put outside and they told the 
people to run, and those who coul
dn™t run were shot either shot
 on the spot or they were 
put on a truck and taken outside Œ outside of 
the camp to the woods and they were shot 
there in the woods, and then buried in a ma
ss grave. And Renia was already sick with 
fever and Hania sent her to the laundry room
 whe r e there was a lot of steam, and Renia 
and another friend of Renia™s who was more or 
less her age, the two of them were told to 
go to the laundry room, because there nobody ca
me  in to look, and it was kind of steamy 
and hot and all that, and two days later, they
 told me  to go over 
to Strzelnica because Œ 
after they took out the dead pe
ople, and they cleaned up the ba
rracks, and I was told to go 
and take over the office in Strzelnica. Hania 
was sick and Renia was sick. So, I took care 
of the office and I took care of them. And it 
wasn™t easy. It wa s not easy, but with God™s 
help, they pulled through. 
 

Q: Can you give us some  details what you had to do?  

 

A: Well– 

 

Q: Did you feed them?  

 

A: There wasn™t that much food really, but it
™s water and I had the experience from
 taking 
care of m
y mother before. So, in a way, I was 
familiar with the routine what to do. I think 
Father got in touch with the 
Paliszewskis, and they send out some  me dication, and so this 

helped quite a bit. So, they 
got on their feet, and no sooner Ha
nia returned back to work, 
and everything was well, I came back to Majo
wka, and my father took sick. So, it™s from 
one situation into the next. So, I took care of
 my  father and, because he was working in 
the office, so his quarters, his 
living quarters, were with the 
head of the admi nistration of 
the camp and the barber in the camp, and my fa
ther and the man who was in charge of the 
kitchen, I think, there were
 four or five beds in that sm
aller room. So, if you was in the 
barracks, I wouldn™t have been 
allowed to go into a 
regular barracks, bu
t due to the fact 
that he shared this small living space with ot
her pe ople, they wanted to keep them apart 
from the rest of the camp to
 protect them from diseas
es that otherwise you were 
susceptible when you lived with a lot of people 
together. So, I took care of hi m, and there 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
53 
 
was still me dication left over, and that 
was good. And he pulled through, and I was so 
pleased when the crisis was over because I 
was more worried about him than about my 
sisters. And I don™t have to tell 
you that I was the last one, righ
t? , to get sick. I must have 
been already like into the fourth day of my 
typhus fever when Father returned to work. 

And I slept Œ we had a women™s barrack, and 
I had a friend who was also a neighbor, and 

she was like ten or fifteen years older, and she wa s a very me ticulous person, and she 

always told me , ﬁI want you to be right ne
xt to me. I don™t want Œ I don™t want you to 
have a straw sick (ph) and I don™t because 
the bed bugs, and their 
lice and everything is 
sitting in them. You are going to
 be sleeping on bare 
boards, just like I am, so we don™t 
invite any problems or any diseas
es and this will keep out Œ this way we™ll keep ourselves 
clean.ﬂ Her name  was Fania Hershtein (ph), a
nd she was really wonderful to me  because 
she kind of taught me  how to survive under such
 circumstances, and so we had the corner 

bed on the upper level. But people were going to
 work, so there was not all the time the 

same  person around you, and this was the onl
y place that you could stay. They had an 
infirmary, but who wanted to go to the in
firmary. You knew that once you are going to 
go to the infirmary, you™ll never come out, wh
ether it was in our camp, the slave labor 
camp, or in Auschwitz. So, I was there in that 
corner on that bed, and I reme mber the last 
two days of my sickness. I had a terrible th
robbing in my hea d, and the pain was right 
here and I felt it in my temples, and I thought 
that my whole head is
 going to just break 
open from that pain. I was aware of what 
was happening because I reme mber what was 
being done to me . On the other side of the sp
ace where we slept were two sisters and they 
were from a village not too far away, and th
ey were working on a different shift that 
Fania was working, and because I was crying th
at my head hurt so badl y, one of the 
sisters was holding my Œ put her hands on my
 te mples and was kind of pressing against 
my temples, holding it tight, and this seemed to
 be relieving that th
robbing, that terrible 
pain, and I reme mber when she did it and I fe
lt so comfortable, and that I felt so muc h 

better. And then I do not reme mber anything 
at all until the next day when, all of a 
sudden, I felt that some body came into the 
barracks and pulled me  out from that bed, 
from that spot where I slept, and put me  Œ 
you se e, I was like in th
e corner and facing the 
entrance to the barracks was a window, and th
ere was also a bed down there. Some body 
pulled me out from the top, because I heard ye
lling, ﬁEverybody out of the barracks!ﬂ and 
I just wasn™t in a position to
 get out bed. I figured whateve
r™s going to happen most likely 
will happen, I figured. I didn™t figure Œ I don™
t reme mber, but I reme mber that I did not 
leave the barracks, and some body pulled me  out
 and placed me some where else, and then 

I felt like straw sticks (ph) were being th
rown on top of me . You know, it was like that 
sack filled with straw, and then
 I heard this German yelling, ﬁ
Aus, aus!ﬂ
 That means get 
up, get out. And, then they came in most likel
y with bayonets and the rifl es because I 
could hear above me  that poking in the sp
aces to ma ke sure that nobody is around, and 
then I could hear some  poking in front of
 me , around me , but I didn™t Œ nobody hit me  
and nobody hurt me . And, when the day was over, the followi ng day, and I felt better and 

I was aware of what Œ I was told of what 
took place, that it™s the same  thing as in 
Strzelnica, that people were
 shot, those who couldn™t r
un fast enough, and were taken 
away to be shot in the woods. I just couldn™t figure out what happened. About eight years 

ago, a guy from Israel came for a visit to Vine
land, and he was in charge of a federation 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
54 
 
project. It was a sister city of Vineland that
 we were supporting in Is
rael, and his children 
were also very involved in the rehabilita
tion of the community. So, he was brought to 
Vineland to speak about what was acco
mp
lished with the money that Vineland 
community was sending to Israel
, and he came with the chairman of the campaign here to 
us because, once he knew that it was Vine
land and I live in Vineland, he says, ﬁI 
reme mber Rozka Laks. I would like to see he
r.ﬂ So, you know, when they discussed that 
whole idea in Israel, so he was promi sed th
at when he come s to Vineland, he™s going to 
see me. We were sittingat 
the table. I had served coff
ee and cake, and his name  is 
Penhurst Hoffnitz (ph). Unfortuna
tely, he passed away three 
years ago. And he turns to 
me  and he s a ys like this, ﬁDo you reme mber,ﬂ he says, ﬁduring that 
typhus period in the 
camp when they came to Majowka and they to
ld everybody to leave the barracks and you 
were so sick? ﬂ  he says. ﬁI came to look fo
r my sister, and I saw you, and I pulled you off 
that bed and I placed you on the lowe r bed, hopi
ng that you will be much safer in front of 
the window than some where in the corner hiding.ﬂ Now, this revelation wa s some thing. I 

mean, in front of Miles and in front of th
e local chairman of the JA Ca mp aign. It was 
such an unbelievable story. I knew that 
some body had done some thing for me , but I 
never knew who the person was, and it was Penhu
rst, and I didn™t know
 about it until he 
came to the United States. So, those are situ
ations beyond one™s control, without even 
knowing why they happen, how they happen, and in
 what circumstances they are. I don™t 
know, I have ma ny interpretations when I thi
nk about it. When I think about Mother and 
her dedication and work for Israel, and this 
being connected with fe
deration and Israel, I 
just don™t know. I really don™t wa
nt to get that mystical. But,
 I™ll never forget it. I me an 
this is such an eye-opener. So ma ny peopl
e used to ask me , you know, after the war, 
ma ny peopl e asked me , ﬁSo, who was the pers
on who did it? ﬂ  I can™t reme mber, but 
some body did it, and it was Penhurst, and you k
now, it just came out so naturally. He  
says, ﬁDo you reme mbe r? ﬂ  So, when people say, ﬁHow did you survive? ﬂ Now, how do 

you explain what survival meant?  There are 
no words to describe, I me an, why and how. 
And in what way, whether it was up to a tota
l stranger or to a friend. Whe n I think about 
it, I always feel that there must have been
 like an angel, a guard
ian angel watching over 
us that kept us together a
ll three sisters throughout. I me n
tioned last time about Fela Œ 
Fela Berlant (ph), who ma de it possible for us 
to be transfer red fr om Auschwitz to better 
working conditions. Now, Fela Berlant was 
a Jewish girl from home , and she didn™t 
really know us from Ada m before, and it just happened so that she ma de it possible to 

take us from the worst conditions where we 
were almost, so to say, reaching a point of 
total starvation and give us Œ place us Œ in a si
tuation for the next three months that made 
us feel like huma n beings all over again, that 
gave us self esteem all over again, gave us 
the opportunity to kind of go on with what was m
eant to become  Œ with 
the things that we 
were confronted with in the following mont
hs, and so it™s destiny, ma ybe, or for sure.

Q: Chris, you were in some ways alone with your father. I mean, there were other people 
around with whom you were friends, but you indi
cated that your relationship with your 
father changed som
e wha t  in the context of th
at camp, that in some  way you got closer to 
him then you had before. Can you describe 
that relationship with how you understand 
what happened between you?  
 

A: Well, Father was, so to say, the head of th
e fa m
ily like in mo st European home s, and he 
was a disciplinarian. He was a very me ticulous
 individual Œ everything had to be just 
perfect with him. He didn™t spend much 
time with us when we were younger. So, 
basically, I only thought of hi m 
as a parental figurehead, youknow, that is a parent. That 
we have certain responsibility 
as children, and he has respons
ibilities of a father. So, the 
time we spent together Œ I mean, the time that
 we experienced as children, speaking of 
parents were more so with my
 mother than with Da d. Father wa s away a lot from home , 
and when he came home he was busy also 
preparing the work th
at he was doing. And 
also, we were much too young for him to really 
be involved with us. Wh en we got a little 
older, I said he was in the free time that he
 had with us, we were singing and we were 

harmonizing and we were discussing things, you 
know, because we were a little older, he 
always wanted to know what we are reading a
nd he was kind of intere
sted more so in our 
development as people rather than to give 
us guidance. It™s Moth
er who did the job. And, 
it was during the job when we were together
 especially in Ma jowka where I was with 
him, that I could see him as a person, as 
a person who has the patience and who does care 
and who was loving, and who was concerned 
with our well-being and on occasion he 
mentioned Mother, I reme mber. But I™m sure that
 it must have been very painful for him 
to speak about it. I used to always say to
 him that we™ll find Mother, Dad, don™t worry. 
We™ll find her some whe r e. She must be some
where. So, I don™t know whether I believed 
in it or whether it was just that hope, but th
is could have kind of encouraged him to on 
occasion speak about it. He was very, very bus
y because he ha d a very responsible job. 

People were dying, and people we
re sick, and some  people we
re shot, and he had to 
provide the work force every morning, regardle
ss of how ma ny people 
were available. It 
was his responsibility. So, it™s not like under norma l circums t ances where you get up in 

the morning and there you go out and the peopl
e were waiting to go to work. Every once 
in awhile there were five mi ssing, ten mi ssing and he had to find them, you know?  And 

then, of course, he had to di
scuss those things with the 
admi nistration of the camp, the 
Jewish admi nistration of the camp, and they in 
turn discussed it most likely with the Nazi 
authorities and when there was a shortage 
of people, people were
 being brought from 
other camps to Starachowice, to Majowka or 
Strzelnica. When the transports came, and a 
few hundred people at a time , and he had 
to get everything ready for the following 
morning because there wa s really, there were
 a few hundred people. There was really a 
shortage in manpower that I used to be with hi
m in the offi ce until very late to make sure 

that he concluded his work, because  cross-
indexing the files and putting everythi ng in 
place and who arrive d and from whe r e and who was gone and, you know, it wasn™t easy 

for just one person to do it. S
o, in addition to the work that 
I have been doing, I have been 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
56 
 
also helping him to the extent
 that I could. So, I had this 
comfort of being around him and 
to really get to know him. He was just 
a wonderful person, an
d because I kind of was 
optimistic about Mother being some where in li
fe, that we™ll some day be reunited, I guess 
ma ybe it was a comfort not only for me , but fo
r him as well. We didn™t have much time 
for fun or anything like that
, but the mome nts that we ha
d together were very, very 
important. You also mentioned something about 
culture or spending culturally the time  in 
camp. Another kind of a semi -private facility
 was of the dentist, where he had his 
equipment that he brought from the ghetto Œ ac
tually from his office from before the war 
Œ and all he had really wa s that drill that 
was operated with a pedal; it wasn™t el ectric. 
And a chair, of course, and he
 didn™t fill cavities, but
 if you had a toothache, he pulled the 
tooth out and that was it. So, he
 had this office in one barrack
s, a separate area. I think it 
was not far from the other barracks where my fa
ther was. And next to it, he had his living 
quarters. So, in the evening on occasion, when we felt the need for some  kind of a 

cultural thing, that was the best pl ace to meet. 
So, we used to there to his office, and he 

had a friend, a very lovely lady. No, she was 
his wife! Right, Leona 
was his wife. And we 
used to get together and there were people 
who were singing, and 
there were people who 
were reciting poetry. So, on occasion we used 
to have like an evening of this nature. 
There was a fellow, I don™t know where he wa
s from, but he was Œ whether he had a 
singing voice or not, I don™t know, but he was 
whistling ﬁZigeunerwei
senﬂ, not singing Œ 
but to a point that every note was perfect, ju
st from the whistling. The whole thing from 
beginning to end, and that was the bi ggest tr
eat of all because the music you are familiar 

with ﬁZigeunerweisenﬂ? It™s a very sen
timental song. ﬁZigeunerweisenﬂ means gyps y 
airs, so actually there is a nostalgia for 
the freedom of being out in the open, you know, 
the life of gypsies. So, there is this beau
tiful music, there is the longing for the open 
spaces, and it was to me  Œ it was just  like 
putting myself into a dream world without 

dreaming of some thing beautiful. There was no fu
ture whatsoever. If we could not dream, 
or if we could not think of pleasant things
, we would not have survived. So me  people 
were thinking forever about a good meal. Some
 people had different things on their mi nd. 
Most people were thinking about the fa mily they 
lost, and still to be 
able not to give up 
hope and to dream was one of the important as
pects of survival. So, those evenings we re 
very, very important. We couldn™t do them too 
often. We  had to be very comfortable with 
ourselves and knowing that whoever was in charge, the comma ndant, whether he was a 

Ukrainian Œ in most cases a Ukrainian Œ 
or the commandant in charge of the camp 
guards, I mean, that even if he were to come
 in, that he would not get angry and disperse, 
ma ke sure that we are punished in one way 
or another. So, some  
of them came in and 
they just sat around and listened. 
 

Q: How ma ny would get into th
e office? W
as it a big office? 
 

A: 
I would say twenty, thirty people. 
 

Q: And, it was me n and wome n. I mean, 
people came from
 the men™s barracks. 
 

A: Right.Right. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
57 
 
 
Q: For people who don™t know the gypsy air, ﬁZig
eunerweisenﬂ, could you just sing the first 
couple of bars?  You don™t 
have to whistle it. 
 

A: 
Well, it goes like this. [Sings on ‚la™.] And so
 on and so on. I mean, I just love it. It™s one 
of m
y favorite songs. 
 

Q: But you haven™t learne
d to whistle it yet. 
 

A: No, I didn™t.  

 

Q: Do you remember, whe n you were sleepi
ng, did you have bad dreams in Majowka?  

 

A: I have bad dreams now. I don™t reme
mber, but I have the bad dream
s now. 
 

Q: 
You have bad dreams now about?  
 

A: I have bad dreams now a  lot of times. I wa
ke up and I scream ﬁMomm
aﬂ. I  me an, that™s 
the first thing. I usually wake up, I sit up in 
the bed, and I scream ﬁMomma ,ﬂ but it takes 
me so much to bring it out that I must be
 going through tortures be
fore I bring it out. 
Once I bring it out, then I™m awake. I dr
eam about running away from dangerous 
situations. I feel I™m being chased by the 
Nazis. But for one strange reason, I™m always 
running with my two little
 children, with Jeanette and David 
as little children in my arms. 
I can™t  interpret it in any way as feeling that
 I have to protect my
 children as a parent 
from a dangerous situation, but basically it wa
s my fears of the N
azis that my children 
did not have to be involved. It™s ma ybe 
because, knowing that th
e responsibility of a 
parent is to guard your own children, so th
is is why I™m always running. Quite often, you 
know, when people in the beginning used to 
ask me how come I don™t have any more 
children, in a joking way I used to sa y, ﬁBecau
se  I only have  two arms.ﬂ If I had a few 
more arms, ma ybe I would have mo re chil
dren, but for running away from difficult 
situations when I am threatened with being in
 camp or being Œ that 
Nazi s ar e al ways aft e r  
me , I™ m running with my kids, two little kids. 
 

Q: If you don™t reme mber dreams, were you always 
tired in Majowka?
 Did 
you feel as if you 
got rest?  
 

A: No. You don™t feel tired wh
en you™re in situations like 
that. You are driven. You are 
driven because you are driven
 because Œ actua
lly, because 
you are driven physically by 
whoever supe rvisor s the work because you have to ma ke sure that everything is done on 

time. If you fall behind, you either punished or 
there is another whatever outcome  of t he 
situation Œ in most cases punishme nt or b
eating or whatever. And when you are young, I 
think that you can ma nage a lot easier with di
fficult situations than when you are older. I 

could see that wome n who were five or ten ye
ars older, no more, let™s say we were fifteen 
or sixteen, they were twenty or twenty-fiv
e and they were already ma rried or had a 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
58 
 
fa mily, and the fa mily was taken away from th
e m
, that they did not have that drive to 
survive. Especially when they were alone, if
 they didn™t know what 
happened to the rest 
of the fa mily. For them, life was very, very
 difficult, very difficult, and the working 
conditions were very bad. People used to work
 in front of machines in heat that was 
burning through their garments. We  c ouldn™t 
get other things to wear. Food wasn™t 
adequate. Be d bugs were all over. They were 
falling off the ceiling in the mi ddle of the 
night with like parachutes. 
Lice were on your body and in your 
clothes, in the seams of 
your clothes Œ no ma tter how hard you tried to
 ma intain a certain degree of hygiene, you 
couldn™t ma nage. So, you tried your very be
st. We  had like long troughs with running 
water in the barracks and outside of the barr
acks. So, during the summertime, we used to 
wash ourselves outdoors because it was so muc h 
better, but in the wint ertime we used to 
bring the Œ I don™t think that we
 had the running troughs in th
e barracks, but we had a pan 
of water and we used to wash ourselves 
and on occasion if anybody had contact with the 
outside, because when went to work in th
e factory, you me t with 
the Christian population 
of the town, and there were people who ma
ybe weren™t willing to
 give you outright 
some thing as a gift , but they were willing to
 take  a me ssage to some one who was willing 
to help you and by getting some thing in return 
they would bring it to you to the factory. 
And some  people even if they didn™t know you at 
all, but they felt that if it can help you 
that they were willing to do it 
as well. So, there we re all kind
s of different situations. So, 
on occasion you had a piece of soap and so
 you could launder your undergarme nts and 
keep yourself clean that way. What we used to do is when we worked on the night shift in 

the summertime, we use d to sleep outdoors 
instead of in the barracks during the day 
because Œ in the summer time only, not in the wint er, of course , it was cold. But, we came 

back from work in the morning. So, we took 
a blanket or whatever was there on the bed 
and spread it out outdoors on the grass, right 
under the fence and we slept outdoors. So, at 
least we didn™t have to cope with the 
bedbugs. It was better sleep and we got some  
sunshine on our bodies, got 
a suntan free of charge. 
 

Q: Did it smell?  

 

A: Smellwhat? 

 

Q: The people the barracks because people coul
d no
t wash very much. W
a s that some thing 
distinctive that you reme mber?  
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Noise in the barracks?  

 

A: No. We  had to be very quiet because on
ce you entered the barrack
s, everybody was tired. 
Everybody had to sleep after a day™s work. I me
a
n, I used to go to sleep on occasion and 
if my father needed me  I was always ready. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
59 
 
Q: Besides this woma n Fenia Œ 
Fania, rather, who was helpfulto you, since you have contact 
with your tw
o sisters, did you see them?  
 
A: No. 

 

Q: Youdidn™t. 

 

A: Not too often. 

 

Q: But you were able to see them?  

 

A: Not too often. 

 

Q: And you we re separated from the m for a year, two years?  

 

A: For about a year, and then
 they Œ the situation w
a
s constantly changing depending on 
where they needed the labor force. So eventua
lly, they eliminated completely the el ectric 
plant. They eliminated co mpletely the brick 
factory, and they were concentrating ma inly 
on the ammunition aspect of it, because th
e ma in production was the ma nufacture of 
shells for Œ anti-aircraft she
lls and, you know, the very larg
e shells. So, the me n worked 
with the big shells, and the wome n, you know, th
ey had to be cut Œ I don™t know how to 
say it in English Œ but they were placed like in
 a machine that was sized to the millimeter 
and there was like Œ it was turning the metal sh
ell for the exact size to file it down to 
perfection, and this is was what women we
re doing. Also, wome n were working on the 
premises in camp, you know, cleaning the barr
acks, taking care of
 the laundry Œ not 
personal laundry, but whatever, you know, the kitc
hen stuff and all that, and for example, 
later on, when I stopped going to the factory, 
to the brick factory, and I wa s helping 
Father quite often, he used to send me  to work
 wherever there was a shortage of people. I 
mean, I was the standby Œ wherever another pe
rson was needed and he didn™t have it. So, 
this is how I was filling in, and because of that
 I had a very nice, very pl easant experience 

one time. It was like ma ybe two weeks before 
they send us to Auschwitz, an order came  

from the offi ce Œ from the factory ma in o
ffice Œ that they needed some one who knows 
how to type. Father didn™t have
 a typist on hand to send to th
e factory. So, he says to me , 
ﬁI would like  you to go because it™s for a da
y until the find some one. The y need a typi st 
for tomorrow.ﬂ So, he says, ﬁWhatever you do w
ill be all right. I have to send a person.ﬂ 
So, I go with the group in the morning to work
 and they tell me  where to go, and I come 
in and I enter this room and it has like in a cl
assroom, s mall desks, and in front there is 
like a glassed in area and there is this h
ead of the office. I don™t know who he was, I 
never saw him in my life, in uniform you know Œ a Nazi Œ and I come  in and I™m very 

strange and I don™t know where to go, and the 
guard who brought me  in is taking me to 

the front right in front of the glassed in o
ffice, and there™s this huge, huge type machine, 
and with paper inserted in it 
and all that, and as I walk, I 
can hear like people call my  
name , and I turn here, there is a friend from
 school, there is a frie
nd from school. I just 
didn™t know whether it was real or not, and I 
come  to that big typewriter and the German 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
60 
 
come s out and he says to me  do I know how to type, and I tell him yes, I do. And, he tells 
me that I have to prepare all this for today. 
So, I sat down, and fortuna
tely he wasn™t there 
for too long, you know, he just cam
e  to organi
ze the work and ma ke 
sure that everybody 
is at their desks, and I worked. I don™t 
know how good I was or how bad I was. It was 
only for one day, so I never returned. But 
during a break, those two guys with whom I 
was in high school came running to me  and they
 threw me  up in the air. I mean, from 
happiness, they just picked me  up and threw me
 like a ball, and they said, ﬁYou are alive. 
How wonde rful to see you!ﬂ Now, you will ask 
me the name s of those guys. There isn™t a 
single name I reme mber. I only remember that in
 the very back, at th
e last  desk in that 
room, was my professor who taught me  Latin. 
I couldn™t stand his gut
s, and I don™t think 
he liked me  either, and he  wanted to fail me
 because I didn™t like him. He was teaching 
history for one year and then he was teachi
ng Latin. And every professor in school liked 

me  a lot and they saw a potential in me , a
nd he a l ways looked for the negative, and he 
always said that I am not 
a sincere student. And everybody el
se– None of the professors 
where really as vindictive when it came to an
 exam as he was. I reme mber when Œ every 
once in a while he™d ask ques
tions, especially vocabulary, ne
w words Œ so, when I got up, 
he used to keep people for two mi nutes, for 
three mi nutes. He used to keep me  some times 
for fifteen minutes. He kept me  as long as I 
couldn™t give him an answer. I used to come  
home  and cry and Mother would say, ﬁLook, th
e only way to overcome this is for you to 
be very, very prepared, not 
just prepared. There is nothi
ng because if he ma de up his 
mi nd that he™s going to fa il you, you better be 
prepared for it.ﬂ His name  was Kaifash 

(ph), this I reme mber, his name  I™ll reme mber
 fo rever, and he was sitting there in the 
back, and I hadn™t given him the courtesy to ev
en say hello or look at him.  We ll, he was 
just awful. Even the director of the Gy mnasium liked me a lot and he was so helpful in 
getting me  tutoring jobs and everything, and 
everybody believed in me . Just this one he 
wanted to fail me . So, I don™t want to say he
 was anti-Semite ma ybe he ha d a different Œ 
whatever. Anyhow, he was the one that I wasn™t
 even excited to see,
 but with the other 
two fellows, it was just so wonderful. And of 
course after that day, 
I never came back to 
this particular place of empl
oyment because most likely it 
was only a temporary kind of a 
need for whatever it was for the job, and a 
week later the camp was closed completely. 
There was a breakout from the camp at night. 
People tried to escape because, once they 
closed the camp, we knew that we are not 
going to be going to work anymore. So, young 
people cut through the fence and cut the fence an
d tried to get it out, and in a very short 
while the watchtowers noticed it, and they thre
w all the refl ectors in that  direction and 
they were shooting and a lot of people were 
killed, a lot of people 
escaped, but we lived 
in a very wooded area where the reactionary 
Polish partisan groups were operating, and 
Jewish escapees had hardly a chance to su
rvive, and those who were caught not only 
were they pursued by the Nazis and the Ukra
inian guards, but the Poles hardly gave a 
sympathetic ear to the place of 
the Jews and they were sending them away if they did not 
turn them over to the Nazis, so a lot of 
people lost their lives this way. Quite a number 
survived. Among them was my future brothe
r-in-law, Hania™s husband, who was able to 
ma ke it and he joined the partisan
 group and he survived the war.  
 

Q: That™s Victor, right?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
61 
 
 
A: No, Victor is my other one. 

 

Q: That™s right, I reversed them. So, they
 Œ did they know each other in the camp
?  
 

A: They were from the sa me town. 

 

Q: Was that an organized breakout?  

 

A: No. It just, of course, people knew. If Œ As
 I me
ntioned to you before, we lived in the 
same  community. So, there were contacts to be
 ma de, whether contacts for extra food, or 
contacts for a garment, for a coat or a pair of
 shoes, or whatever. There we re also contact 
with underground activities, and that 
Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa
, JOB, what they 
called it, the Jewish Fighting 
Organization, was operating at 
the time after the uprising of 
the Wa rsaw ghetto because this was already 
the end of 1943. So, they were reaching out 
to different camps to let the people know what
 is happening and not to give in and if you 
have any way of survival, I mean, any way of escaping from c a mp, that this is some thing 

that you should do, and there™s no doubt in 
my mind that there were people who knew 

what was going on because even the group from Krakow that I knew Œ Vushka 

Liebeskind (ph) and her husband was one of 
those people that were involved with the 
underground activities Œ and th
eir ma in job was sending out me ssenger to still existing 
Jewish communities, whether it was in camps or in forced labor camps or even in 

Auschwitz, they were trying to ma ke contact 
with those people and tell them to try to 
escape because this is the only way, and they
 were very instrume ntal in even sending 
false documents if you provided for them 
a photograph, they send a document for you. I 
reme mber, when we we re asked to send photogra
phs to Œ I mean, to ma ke sure that we 
have photographs for docume nts, and I reme mb
e r  some how I  ma naged for all of us to 
have photographs taken and I had given it to
 some body, but  it was such a short period 
from the time when there was the breakout at
 camp and two weeks later, when they put 
us on the train to take us to Auschwitz, 
that we never received the documents. When I 
think back about it, I™m not so sure if we w
ould have really tried to
 escape. Knowing that 
Father is some where else, that he was not with
 us Œ if it was just the three of us, ma ybe it 

would have been a different situation, alt
hough for one person it was 
a lot easier than for 
three Œ but having Father in addition to it 
who, always being ma le was always away, a 
distance away, someti mes a greater distance, and someti mes a very short distance, but 

never together, that this would have been
 a good decision. And in July of 1944, they took 
us to Auschwitz because by then the Russian troops were already on the other side of the 

Vistula River and, of course, it was– by then
 they were liquidating most of the camps  
that were  still in existence. Majdanek was already liberated, and the world I™m sure 

became aware of the atrocities that were co
mmi tted in camps, and we were never told 

that we were going to Auschwitz, we just 
were loaded on trains and to an unknown 
destination.

Q: When your sisters came back, when Hania 
and Renia came back, were you living in the 
sam
e  barrack, the three of you?  
 
A: Yeah. 

 

Q: So, you were all put on a train. We re the me
n and wome
n separated 
at that point?  Your 
father is in another part of the train?  
 

A: Yes. Father is in one with the me n, and we are with the women. 

 

Q: And your father is about how old at 
this point, because you are what?  Sixteen?
 
Seventeen?  
 

A: No, close to eighteen by then. So, Father is
, I think, Father was bor
n in 1892?  They w
e re 
ma rried Œ he was an adult during the Second Œ First World Wa r. So, I imagine 

some where around there.  
 

Q: So, at this point, did you – 

 

A: He could have been 
what, forty-five, fifty. 
 

Q: Well, that™s almost fi ft y. 

 

A: Fifty. Right. Fi
fty. Som
e
thing like that, right. 
 

Q: Chris, underneath what you were experien
cing Œ you know really te
rrible things are 
happening Œ do you have any idea that there ar
e other extermination 
camps, that people 
are being killed. You know in certain circum
st
ances they get killed indiscrimi nately, in 
the hospital if they™r
e doing a selection or liquidating, 
but do you have any idea in your 
head, or did you put that out?  
 

A: No, it™s not that we put it out. We  kne w that
 there is no way out for us anymore. And no 
ma
tter where we were, whether we were in this
 camp or whether we we
re to be taken to 
another camp Œ because up to this point for 
whenever we were Œ when we were in 
Starachowice, whenever a group 
was brought from a different 
camp to us, they were to 
do exactly what we did, so we thought that this  was the way, that if we are transferred to 

another camp, we will be taken out of the fa
miliar environment where we had still some 
help fr om the outside, to a totally st range e
nvironment, that things will defi nitely get 
worse, but it will be again a slave labor camp. We  did not know yet at this point that 

people who are working are exterminated. We
 only knew that people Œ those who were 
taken to Tr eblinka or  those who were taken to Belzec Œ that those people were 

exterminated. 
 

Q: You knew that?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
63 
 
 
A: Well, we knew from that ma n who came in 1942. 

 

Q: Did you also have an idea where the Russi
ans were?  You m
e ntione
d a couple of mi nutes 
ago that– 
 

A: We knew where the Russians were because there was an uprising in Wa rsaw, the Polish 
uprising, not the uprising in the ghetto, but 
the Polish population. They were hoping that 
the Russians are going to cross the river. A
nd when we were brought to Auschwitz in 
July 1944, within three weeks th
ere were a lot of Christia
n P
oles who were brought from 
Warsaw to Auschwitz, and as a ma tter of fact, 
that was the fi rst time when in ther e were a 
lot of Christian Poles in Birkenau, because up 
until that time  they were mostly political 
prisoners, and they were placed, the me n in
 particular, in Auschwitz. They were 

interrogated in Auschwitz. They were killed
 in Auschwitz. They worked in Auschwitz. 
Only wome n were in separate part of Birken
au of which I had me ntioned before that we 
worked for a brief period, for three months
. But a large group of Polish Christian women 
from the ghetto Œ not ghetto, but the Warsaw
 uprising was brought to Birkenau at the 
time, which was August, end of August into Se ptember, and from the m, we found out 

what was happening. 
 

Q: So, there was the uprising in the camp and clearly some  kind of liquidation, and a group 
of you Œ about how m
a
ny people were 
in Majowka that you can reme mb er?  
 

A: I couldn™t tell towards the 
end. I don™t really Œ I would sa
y that there was either one 
carload of wome
n or two ma
ybe twice as ma ny for me n. 
 

Q: So, there were more men in the camp ? 

 

A: Of course, there was always more me n than wome n in camp. 

 

Q: A significant difference, do you think?  

 

A: No. I would say ma ybe wome n represented one-ha
lf, not one half of to
tal, but le
t™s s
ay if 
we were to categorize a group as a whole, I w
ould say, like, one-third 
and two-thirds, that 
kind of thing. 
 

Q: How do you reme mber that day that you we
re put on the train to go to Auschwitz?  You 
don™t know where you™re going. 
 
A: 
Well, I reme mber it in so ma ny different 
ways. I reme
mber Œ I mean, I don™t know what 
happened to other people, but I reme mber very
 well what happened to me . We  were not 
allowed to Œ I mean, we™re closed up and the 
people who tried to escape were either Œ 
some of them were killed on one side of the fence, some were killed on the other si de of 
the fence, some  were killed in the woods. A
nd the rest of us had rema ined in camp, and 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
64 
 
there was a woma n whose husband worked in 
the infirmary, and she was with us, and 
they were from
 Plotzk or from another tow
n. There was a husband and a wife, and he was 
either a doctor Œ he had some  knowledge of 
me dicine because he was working in the 
infirmary. So, I really don™t know if he was a 
doctor or he was not a doctor. And he came  
to the barracks Œ that was thing about the 
slave labor camp: on occasion they allowed you 
to go to see the fa mily, you know, if there wa
s a husband and a wife
, or a brother and a 
sister, or whatever. So, he come s in. It was 
like two days prior to taki ng the transpor t to 
Auschwitz of which we don™t know anything, I m
ean, where we were destined to go. He 
come s in and he brings to his wife a vial wi
th cyanide, and he pulls out of the pockets 
several vials and he says to me , ﬁI don™t know
 where we are going, but I know for sure 
that we are going to die,ﬂ he says. ﬁNow, 
I brought it for anyone who wants it. I am going 
to use it mys e lf. I am going to give it to 
my wife. If you want one, you can have it.ﬂ It 
was a little thing, you know. And I reme mber, 
I couldn™t Œ I just Œ it didn™t register 
immediately, and I thought, ﬁWhat is he talk
ing about?  What do I need that for? ﬂ And, 
then I say, ﬁNo, no thank you. I don™t want it.ﬂ A
nd it™s not because I wanted to live. It™s 
not because I knew better. It™s becaus e I knew th
at I cannot do away with myself if I have 
a father and I have two sisters. And here 
I had an opportunity and 
people did take their 
lives in the cattle cars 
on the way to Auschwitz.  
 
Q: You saw that?  

 

A: I didn™t see it, but from the 
people th
at we m
et after the war,
 when they started to talk 
about this one and that one a
nd this one. But here I was given the outright opportunity to 
have that little vial
 with cyanide in it. 
 

Q: Do you think you actually would have taken it 
had you not Œ if your fa m
ily wasn™t there, 
if you had been alone? 
 

A: I have no idea. I don™t think so. I wanted to 
live. I wanted to live
 in the worst possible 
way. I was young and I never gave up the idea th
at some
where, some how there is a future 
for us. I believed so strongly, and I think this
 is what really gave
 us this courage to 
ma nage in the worst situations
. In that world of helplessnes
s and hopelessness, if you did 
not have that desire, it just 
Œ you just gave in and that was 
it. It Œ you needed courage for 
that. I feel that the courage that I had was fr
om my two sisters and I think that they had 
this responsibility. We  all had this responsib
ility for one another, 
all the time . And, it™s 
not Œ it™s this being together, and worrying 
about another, because once we  got off the 

train in Auschwitz, when we were brought Œ we 
were told to step out of the cattle cars 
and we stood there on the ramp Œ it wasn™t a bi
g transport. It was a small group of people. 
And being a working unit, not a group, a transp
ort from a ghe tto that was liquidated, they 
most likel y felt that they are going to utilize 
us as labor force in 
Auschwitz, as well. We 
were not destined imme diately to go to the 
gas chamber. So, Father stepped out and his 
car was like the car, the last 
car, and ours was the first car, where the women were. So we 
were separated, and I still reme mber wa
ving to Father, saying goodbye, and he was 
waving to us. It was such a strange encounter 
coming to Auschwitz. It was just so awful. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396

We were traveling for about two days. We  had several st ops because every time a 
military train had to go by and they needed th
e tracks, th
ey put us on the side track in 
small communities. We  never knew where we 
were until finally, we came  in. We  pulled 
into a br ightly light ed area, and it was like th
e mi ddle of the night or a little later, and 
there was always such a mi st around Auschw
itz because it was - you know, there was a 
lot of humidity. So, we couldn™t see the fences
 or the electrically 
charged poles, but all 
we could see was the big, big light and the 
mi st, a mi st all around. The mist was kind of 
like in a dream. You didn™t Œ you saw shapes,but yet you couldn™t see them clearly, and 

not until daybreak did they take us out Œ 
I mean, they opened the doors and we left the 
cattle cars, and they took us to the barracks. 
No, before they took us to the barracks, of 
course, we had to go through the routine. So, we took our Œ all we had, like a little 

knapsack that they let us carry, because that™s
 all we came wi th. It™s not like we were 
comi ng from home  like most of the transpor
ts that they brought
 a lot of personal 
belongings. We ca me  fr om a camp. We didn™t 
have much. So, it was like a knapsack or 
some thing very small where we carried a few 
personal things, and they brought us to this 
huge room, I reme mber, and there were the girl
s at one desk for registration, and then at 

the next desk the girls who were tattooing th
e number, and then there was the next desk 
where they were shaving or cutting hair. So, 
first we went through this Œ I me an, we went 
through this routine. We  had to say where 
we came from and our names, our age, and 

everything, and this is how the process st
arted. From your name , you be come  a number. 
So, they tattooed this number on my arm, and 
we  stood all three one behind the other, and 
it was A14176 for my older sister Hania, 
it was A14177 for me, and it was A14178 for  
Renia. Now, after the war, we found out 
that the A was a new series, because the 
numbers were so tremendous by then, that 
they couldn™t ma nage anymore. So, they 
introduced the A and then they introduced
 the B, I think, for the me n, when they 
introduced the A for the wome n. We  always stoo
d next to one another.
 So, therefore, now 
if we Œ just in case we forget which number
 is ours, we have on following the next one. 
 

Q: Did you also get a number that you had to sew on to your uniform?  

 

A: Yes. I reme mber. So, this was the next stag
e. And I was very, very upset, and I just didn™t 
know, and I started to cry. I started to cry a
nd the girl who was tattooing the num
ber held 
my skin tight, and she says, ﬁI™m
 going to give you such a pretty number,ﬂ she says, ﬁthat 
you™ll never regret that you had it.ﬂ Because, if you reme mber, some people had their 

number right here on this side 
of the arm, and the numbers are 
so big that they start at the 
elbow and end at the wrist, because  in those days, people who were tattooing weren™t 

experienced enough. Wh en we came, which was 
still towards the end, it was July 1944, 
the people who Œ the wome n who worked at
 certain jobs, they were very, very 
experienced. So, this was the next thing. From 
there, we went to the benches where they 
were cutting hair and shaving hair, dependi
ng on the individual. I mean, they stood with 
clippers and they also had sc
issors, and here I am crying, 
and the girl who puts me  down 

on the bench and she pushes my hair back, 
and she says, ﬁDon™t cry. I™m not going to 
shave your head. I™ll just cut it 
short.ﬂ So, my hair wasn™t cu
t short Œ I mean, my hair was 
cut short, kind of cropped because I had very 
long hair. My sister was so gorgeous. She 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
66 
 
had such beautiful waving hair. She was just su
ch a beautiful, beautiful wo
ma n Œ girl, and 
they cut her hair short and Renia has always
 curly hair so whatever they did was okay. 
And as my older sister gets up from t he bench, 
there was a door with 
a glass in it, and she 
walked by and she kind of put her hand on her 
hair and ki nd of pushed a wave in place, 
and there was a German guard right behind he
r. He grabbed her by 
the collar and he put 
her down back on the bench and he said to th
e girl who was cutting hair, ﬁShave it off.ﬂ 
So, there she is. She had her hair short, and 
because she dared to look at herself, to see 
like any huma n being when there is a change
 that™s comi ng about you, that you want to 
see what it looks like, so for this, she had he
r hair cut Œ I mean, shaven. Now, from there, 
we had to leave everything behind. 
 
Q: I™m sorry, we have to interrupt because th
e tape is through. We have to go to the next 
tape. 
 

End of Tape #6 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
67 
 
Tape #7
 
 
Q: Chris, when we stopped the tape the last
 Œ a few mi
nutes ago, you were talking about 
your sister who had gotten a short hair cut, a
nd then had looked in the mi rror and the SS 
officer grabbed her and said, ﬁReally cut her hair.ﬂ 
 

A: Shaveit. 

 

Q: Shave it. So, she was shaved then? 

 

A: Right. It was not a mi rror. It was just lik
e a glass in a door that
 was open, and you could 
see the reflection in it. A
nd he grabbed her w
ith such anger and sat her down back on the 
bench and he said, ﬁShave her head.ﬂ So, 
her is the beautiful girl who is tall and 
attractive, and the hair is the crown of her, 
so to say, and she™s com
pletely without hair. 
So, we are pushed from t his point into the ne
xt room which is the shower room. Now, we 
don™t know where we are going. We  heard stor
ies about gas chambers. We never knew 
what they looked like. Nobody could describe 
what a gas chamber was like inside. We 
only knew stories that people are being gassed 
and that they are shower heads to ma ke 
believe that it™s a shower room. So, fr om this
 point, we are driven into that room with 

shower heads in it. If I re
me mber correctly, we have to
 undress right then, or ma ybe 
before, right after the regi stration when we r
eached the next  st ep. It™s not quite vi vid in 

my head, you know, and we had to be undressed. 
 

Q: Can I interrupt for a mi nute?  When your 
hair was shaved, was your bodily hair shaved 
also or only your head?
 
 

A: 
At the time  only the hair, hair was cut, not
hing else, and then we 
were without clothes, 
which means that either we 
had to undressed right before entering or m
a ybe before the 
hair being cut. It seems to me  right before 
entering. And we entere
d that room where the 
shower heads, and all of a sudden, you know, wh
ile we were inside, the cold water came  
from above and it was really very, very cold
 and we all screamed because it was just 
piercing through your body, and the water didn™t r
un too long, and we forced out of this 

area into the next area, and there we came to a large room and there were women sitting 

behind a huge table with all kinds of dresse
s piled up on top of the table, and you were 
not handed a garment to wear. Things were thrown at you. So, each of us received a 

dress, a print dress. They did not have unifo
rms at the time that we arrived. I don™t think 
they were giving out unifor ms anymore. There 
we re so much clothes that was confiscated 
from the transport of the arriving people w
ho were put to the gas chambers that they 
didn™t see any need for uniforms anymore. So, 
they threw dresses at us. And those were 
inma tes, those were girls who were working th
ere in the sauna, in that shower room. We 
never Œ as I mentioned before, size Œ there 
was never a question of whether it was your 
size, the right size, the wrong si
ze. So, no sooner did we get our
 clothes thrown at us, if 
some body was tall and had a very short dress 
while another person was very short and 
had a long dress, and some one was very sk
inny and had a big dress or vice versa, a 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
68 
 
heavier wome n a very tightly fitting dress, 
that we were exchanging among one another, 
with each o
ther, so that at least we made those things fit. They were smelly dresses 
because all they did is they took the discarded 
clothes and they put it in Œ they had such 
huge vats with disinfectant flui
d in it. I don™t think they ever
 washed the dresses. I think 
that all they did was they so
aked them in that and then
 they dried them because I 
reme mber that the dress was kind of damp, wh
ether it was damp because it wasn™t dried 
enough or whether it was damp because the da
mpness was always there and it was lying 

some where, you know, where it didn™t dry ou
t completely. I don™t know, but we didn™t 
get any undergarme nts whatsoever. The only th
ing we have gotten was just a dress to 
wear and nothing else. They allowed us to w
ear the shoes that we brought with us. Now, 
in most cases, we recognize each other. I 
couldn™t find Hania. Not only that she didn™t 

look the way I knew her to look and to be, 
she wa s wearing a crazy print dress and 
because she had no hair whatsoever and she wa
s very tall and very slim. So, it was like a 
pin, a long stem with a head, a small head 
on top. It was heartb
reaking to see that 

transforma tion that only was like within a half
 hour no more, from such a beautiful girl 
that she was, so attractive and so pretty, to 
see such a pathetic l
ooking creature. I mean it 
was just horrible. It was ju
st horrible, my heart was 
breaking, and we were handed 
[coughs] Excuse me . We were handed like white 
pieces of cloth with the number that was 

printed on our arms , and under that white clot
h with the number was a triangle. In our 
case, it was a yellow because it was for 
the Jewish prisoners. So, my number A14177, 
and we had to sew it on, on the garment, and th
e dresses also had a 
big, red, wide stripe 
on the back. From this point on, we were ta
ken to the barracks, but all mor ning was 
basically from the unloading of the train 
and going through the process until we were 
brought to the barracks. 
 

Q: Can I interrupt for a mi nute? The sauna, wa
s it a big room
, a sm
all room, were there were 
a lot of people?  
 

A: It was a big room. It was a big room. Ther
e were people in there,
 and the fear of the 
unknown when you com
e  into something that
 you are not familiar with and you don™t 
know what to expect. So, basically if 
you are there with ot
her people around you, you 
only see that far, and nothing beyond. I don™t 
think that it was in anybody™s mi nd to stand 
there and try to figure out, you know, the size 
of the room or whatever it is. We  were 

afraid as we entered. We  were frightened by 
the blast of cold water that came  on us. It 
stopped just as fast as it came . So, bas i cally
 it was a big shock to the mi nd and to the 
body simulatenously, you know, because first you don™t know what to expect and then 

the big shock of that icy cold water comi ng 
at you. That was the way we were brought to 
the barracks, and more or less on our way fr
om the sauna to the 
barracks, si zed up the 
situation Œ what the camp looks
 like. I me ntioned before that
 we arrived and it was dark 
and between the mi st and the lights, you real
ly couldn™t figure out where you were. In 
daytime, it was a sunshiny day so we could see 
that there were differe
nt areas fenced in, 
which meant that  ther e were different secti
ons of the camp. We were also passing by an 
area where there were me n. A lot of people 
during the day when the saw others moving 
along the roads, they used to come close to 
the fences to look whether they will spot  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
69 
 
some one who is familiar or whatever, and we
 were brought to the barracks, where Fela 
Berlant (ph) was the 
schreiberen
, and she, of course, count
ed the group, accepted the 
group, m
a de  sure that everything was in orde
r, you know, and they brought us to the 
designated part of the barracks that our group 
was to occupy, and we were told so-and-so 
ma ny wome n to a space, and that was it. Now,
 there was no official introduction of what, 
how and when because this was a very si
mple thing, you know. Towards the end of the 

day we heard the voice of the woma n who wa
s in charge of Œ the assi stant to the 
barracks™ 
Älteste
, the girl in charge of the barracks, her assistant, to 
Zählappel
, to get out 
of the barracks, outside for counting, and coun
ting was twice a day, in
 the morning and in 
the evening, before we had to 
return back to the barracks. In
 the beginning, they kept us 
for a whole month in a quarantine, as if to say that we were bringing some  kind of disease 

from the outside, to protect the people w
ho were on the inside. It was ridiculous. 
 

Q: Were you in a separate barrack?  

 

A: No, that whole barracks was for all the peopl
e. S
o
me  of the m must
 have arrived earlier 
than Œ a few weeks or a few days or whatever
 earlier Œ because we 
were only placed in 
one small section, and the barracks were divi
ded in four sections. There were bunk beds. 
There were aisles and bunk beds in each si
de. In the mi ddle was a small stove with a 
pipe, and then to the sides, there were lik
e four wi ngs, and each wing had an aisle and 
there were bunk beds on both sides. So, we we
re taken, as we entered the barracks to the 
right, the first aisle. This is 
where the whole group was placed. 
 

Q: So, the entire barrack was a quarantine barrack? 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: And does that mean you had to stay in the barrack all the time?  

 

A: No, we were allowed to 
go outside, and we weren™t work
ing the first two weeks. 
W
e  
weren™t working at all. We were sitting outsi
de. There was nothing to look at, not a blade 
of grass growing in front. It™s dust, when
 it was dried and it was mud that you were 
sinking in, because it was a clay gr ound, and we 
used to sit some ti me s trying to take care 
of our clothes in order to get 
the lice out of it, because the 
dresses that we have gotten, 
inasmuch as they were disinfected, they we
re full of body lice. Fortunately, we went 
through typhus already so we were immune alr
eady at least to one disease that we didn™t 
need. After two weeks, they took us to a pla
ce to work and there we
re huge rocks, and 
they told us to take the rocks and transfer th
em to the other side of the big field. So, we 
did, and the couples who were German inma
tes, German women inmates, they were 
beating us. They were always in charge of 
the working units, and hollering and cursing in 
language, in a kind of a language that we neve
r heard of, we were 
never exposed to, you 
know, the name s that we were called Œ the wo
rst possible name s. But, this wasn™t, you 

know, you accept when you find yourself in a situa
tion like this Œ to survive, people were 
doing all kinds of things that, some time s 
to protect their own lives ma ybe, by being 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
70 
 
mean, mean, bad or whatever to others, by mi
streating other people, that they felt that 
they are going to be pro
tected, th
at it will give them a certain
 security and that they will 
survive. So, I don™t know the motives why 
certain people behaved like huma n beings 
while the others behaved like beasts, and the assi stant to the 
Block Älteste
 was a very, 
very mean woma n. She  was beating everybody a nd she cursing and she was hollering and 
from the mo me nt we entered the barracks, sh
e told us, ﬁYou™re ne
ver going to get out 
alive of here. Whoever gets out of here is 
through the chimneys.ﬂ That was degrading, 
you know?  And the chimneys were quite vi sibl e 
because there were five crematories in 
Auschwitz and you could see them, and you coul
d smell the burning of the human bodies 
and the smoke, it was permeating the air, because in 1944, the transports were comi ng 

from all over and predominately from Hungary, and those people, most of the people, 

went straight to the gas chambers and to the crematorium. So, you have to kind of 

condition yourself to a new situation, a
nd on one hand, you are shocked and on the other 
hand you are tryi ng to ki nd of ma ke peace with your
self that, well, this is the next stage, 
and not to give up hope, that you survived 
the other situations, that you are going to 

survive this one, as well. Yet there was Œ in
asmuch as there was a lot more hope maybe 
in a way, as you were really fooling yourself 
to a certain extent, here you had the answers 
right before you that there™s hardly a
ny hope. You were hoping against yourself. I 
reme mber one night, it was a clear night and 
they didn™t allow us to get out of the 
barracks ri ght after the 
Zählappel
, the counting. Nor mally, we had a very brief time to go 
to the bathroom, to visit a littl
e bit with each ot her outside  before we entered, but that was 
time that they were bringi ng a lot of trans
ports and burning the people, and they just 

didn™t want for us to be out
doors and witness too ma ny activiti
es. So, I reme mber it was a 
very clear night and the smoke, the dark smoke
, was comi ng all day long. I could see it. It 
was the time  of the quarantine yet, and we 
weren™t yet taken out of the camp to work 
some where else, and the smoke was always th
ere, comi ng out of the chimneys, and then 
at night you could also see fi
re Œ not the smoke so much as during the day, but you could 
see fire. And, you know, I was looking out this
 little window and I thought to myself, 
such little tongues of fire we
re escaping towards the sky, and I thought my self, ﬁIt™s like 

huma n souls trying to go to Heaven.ﬂ Fortuna
tely, I didn™t have Œ I wasn™t separated upon 

the arrival from my sisters, a
nd I hoped that Father, who was 
in good health, if he was put 
to work, that he™s okay. So, I didn™t have th
is imme diate fear that some body very close 
that we loved was burned in the crematorium,
 and yet it was so horrible to think, so 
horrible to think of how ma ny peopl e who ne
ver experienced life, who were either 
teenagers or even little children who came to 
this world never had a future, and it™s just 
heartbreaking, now that I™m an
 adult and I am a mother and a parent, and I see how ma ny 
innocent lives have been lost be
cause of Nazi ma dness. 
It™s just terrible. It™s just  terrible. 
And, this was their way of breaking you down sp
iritually Œ I mean, physically due to the 
fact that they didn™t feed you enough, but 
spiritually. And als
o, you know, you kind of 
lost that feeling of Œ how am I going to say 
it Œ of self-worth. I mean, there was no future 
whatsoever. I mean, you were like a pawn 
in somebody™s hands who was to determine 
whether you are going to live or whether 
you are going to die, and you were a pawn 
without committing any crime. You were not there because you committed a crime or 

you because you had done some thing wrong, or 
because whatever reason, but because

you were a Jew and that was the Final Solu
tion and Auschwitz and Birkenau was the 
place to bring the Jews for the Fin
al Solution. 
When they fina lly started to take us out 
after the month of isolation, where they cal
led it Œ I™m getting upset Œ quarantine, and 
they took us to the front, outside of the camp to different places of work, we could see 

groups that were passing by as we were ma
rching to work, and in some  cases Œ among 
them there were wome n Œ we usually tried 
to communicate in passi
ng to find out where 
the people were from, so that if they me
ntioned a fa miliar name, you called somebody™s 
name  from that town that you knew, and if 
they were among them, they answered and 
this is how we found my aunt who was fr
om Ra dom. They were comi ng from the 
opposite direction and they asked, ﬁWhere are 
you from? ﬂ  And we said, ﬁStarachowice.ﬂ 
And, she started to call our names, and she says, ﬁRe me mber, I™m here, too, and I™m still 

alive.ﬂ That was my aunt Rosha Laks from, 
she had the same  name  as I, from Radon. She 
survived the war, by the way. And so, there 
was always the unexpected, some ti me s good 
and some times bad. When we were comi ng back from work, we had enough time to go to 

the bathroom. You know, the bathroom was 
also a barracks that, that you only were 
allowed a certain number of mi nutes at a certai
n time , because it was just one facility for 
twenty barracks that were in that particul
ar area, and if people 
had diarrhea and they 
needed to stay a little longe
r, the couple was always running back and forth. You know, it 
was like Œ it really wasn™t  a bathroom. It was 
a Œ what do they call it in the military, those 
places where there are holes in the 
gr ound?  I don™t know what to call it. 
 

Q: Alatrine?  

 

A: A latrine yes, but a latrine Œ there is a na
m
e for it.
 I don™t remember. It will come to me 
eventually. So, she was running back and fort
h, and if any one woma n needed to use the 
bathroom a little longer. She was hitting, out
right hitting, clobbering the pe ople with the 

rubber hose or whatever she had in her hand. 
But again, there was an advantage in this 

advantage because when you went to the washroom or you went to the bathroom, there 

was always a queue because, you know, this 
was your time and five mi nutes later was a 
time for another barracks, and because there were so ma ny new transports comi ng at that 

time, 1944 in July, that we could inquire of 
where the people are from and whether they 
know anybody that we were looking for. So, 
some ti me s people used to find cousins or 
aunts like in our particular case. Not that we
 had seen my aunt anymore in Auschwitz. It 

was just the one time when our paths had cro
ssed. So, that was the advantage, inasmuch 

as you were beaten. Food was delivered daily 
to the work place, and in the evening at 
Zählappel
, we were getting our bread and the co
ffee in the morning. We  did not have 
individual dishes, but they had these bowls that they filled and since we al ways ma rched 

five abreast, five, you know, that a bowl full 
of food was given to one person and we had 
to pass it around and everybody took a gulp and pa
ssed it to the next one, so there was an 
orderly distribution of whatever
 was given in that bowl, whet
her it was soup or the coffee 
in the morning, quote-unquote, you know. G
od knows what they had in there. 
 

Q: With that distribution of food, did you all 
decide we™ll each take
 on sip un
til it™s all 
through?
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
72 
 
 
A: Right. 

 

Q: So you talked amongst each other?  

 

A: Not really. It was kind of an accepted thing 
that that™s the way it should b
e, not to take  
two gulps when the other person Œ for the 
other person to be deprived of it. But 
distribution of food, for exampl
e, of bread was Œ they did 
Zählappel
 in the evening before 
we entered the barracks. And 
the piece of bread was mostly sawdust, and I would say a 
size of ma ybe two inches by an inch:  an inch
 thick, an inch wide 
and two inches long. I 
wrote the story about a day in Auschwitz whic
h I called ﬁOne Ordinary Dayﬂ, and it™s a 
very Œ it was a very typical difficult day, a
nd we went to work and we worked cutting 

down ma rshes along the river to clear the 
view of the watchtowers because it was 
October already of 1944, and there were 
underground activities,
 and people were 
escaping and some  people we
re successful, and some  pe
ople were not, and those who 
were not successful were brought back to 
camp and there was a public hanging or they 

were shot or whatever, but we were cutting 
the marshes and it was 
pouring all day and we 
stood in 
Zählappel
 and got wet and went to work and even got wetter, and we stood in 
the mud that was comi ng up to our knees 
and the capo was in a horrible mood and the 

German SS me n who we re es
corting the group with the dogs
 were horrible, and after 
returning from work, we were 
told to sing, and we couldn™t 
sing. I mean, we sang but not 
for ma rching, and they wanted 
us to ma rch in good step w
ith the clay and everythi ng on 
our legs. So, they sicked the dogs on us, and 
the dogs tore the clothes off the people who 
were on the outside of the columns. It was ju
st a horrible, horrible 
day, and then we came  
to our barracks and we lined up for 
Zählappel
 and it is still raining and my sister  Hania is 
in front of the column of the five girls 
because it was always right in front of the 
barracks. It was a long line, always five abre
ast. So, if we were ma rching, we were facing 
this way, but when we were standing in front 
of the barracks, there was one in the front 
and four people in the back. And Hania was co
mp laining that she™s dizzy and that she™s 
not feeling well and that she has a headache an
d this and that. And we were counted, the 

food was brought, and Saranka (ph), the woma
n who was so rough and rude, was the one 
who was distributing the food. So
 she was placing five portions
 of bread in the hands of 
the person that was in line up front and the pers
on in the front was to pass the bread over 
to the people in the back, and Hania was up fr
ont that day, and as the bread was placed in 
her hands, instead of turning around and passing 
the bread to others, she took the bread Œ 
the five portions of bread Œ and she brought 
it to her mouth. She was hungry and she had 
all the bread in her hand, and when I saw it I 
was right behind her, I 
st arted to scream. I 
said, ﬁHania, don™t do it. It™s not yours. It bel
ongs to all of us.ﬂ A
nd, it wasn™t a matter of 
not wanting her to eat my brea
d, but we were only three. Ther
e were two girls that  were 
no relation whatsoever to us, and I kind of scar
ed her so that all of a sudden, I could see 
that her eyes have tu
rned like this in her 
head. She looked at me , 
and I could see how her 
eyes turned around and she became pale and she fell to the gr ound. And when I looked at 

her lying there on the ground with her hairless head, and by then it was already almost 

three months in camp where we didn™t look 
anymore like we  looked three months earlier 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
73 
 
when we came from the camp. So, between her 
lying there with a shaved head and her 
face as, you know Œ without m
uch fle sh, she look
ed like Œ he r face was like a skull, and I 
thought that she had died. So, I 
fell to my knees and I started 
to cry, and I tried to shake 
her, and I held her hand, and I said to her, ﬁP
lease don™t die.ﬂ I said to her, ﬁI™ll give you 
my bread. I™ll give it to you today. I™ll give
 it to you every day.ﬂ 
And she did not respond, 
and then the woma n who was distributing th
e bread saw a commotion at our end and she 
came running and she saw what happened. So, sh
e started to holler for some one to bring 
a bucket of water, and she poured a bucket of
 water in Hania™s face. So, when Hania 
opened her eyes Œ because she basically fainted from hunger and from exhaustion and 
everything Œ and she opened her eyes and I wa
s holding onto her hands, and she had this 

smile on her face, not knowing at all what ha
s happened to her. So, I picked her up, and I 
propped her up, so to say. I was holding on to
 her from one side and Renia from the 
other. And at 
Zählappel
, you have got to stay in line, 
be in perfect alignment, and 
inasmuch as she was rude and ugly a
nd unbelievable, that assistant to the 
Block Älteste
, 
she didn™t say anything. She didn™t reprimand 
us. She didn™t holler. She did nothing. We 
just stood for the rest of 
Zählappel
, and then when we went to the barracks, we all we nt 
to bed and lied down in our wet dresses. Ther
e wa s no way how to dry them and where to 
hang them, but we were nine people in that sp
ace, so we kind of cuddled together, hoping 
that the clothes on our bodies will be dry th
e next morning when we have to get up and 
go to work again. So, these were the different 
experiences. Fr om Father we didn™t hear at 
all, inasmuch as we were hoping that some
how no ma tter what, we would be able to 
make contact with him. People told us that 
there was a way of contact men, because there 
were always male inmates that  were comi ng as
 electricians, as plumbers, to the camp. So, 

that if we were to know where he is, becau
se there were different villages around. There 
were different factories where they employe
d people. That if we know exactly which 
campsite that he is at, that ma ybe there w
ould be a chance for us to find out. While we 
were in Birkenau in that barrack, we 
couldn™t know anything about Father, and we 
ourselves were already reaching a point wher
e even our feelings and emotions were 
dying in us. Forget about ev
erything else. You know, you ha
ve compassion for people, 

you try to assist ot hers, and 
so forth and so on, and then you reach a point  that not only 
your body gives up physically, but even your emo
tions and your feelings. That™s why so 
many peopl e tried to end their lives and ran to 
the electrically charged fences. Because if 
they were alone, they couldn™t cope with th
is life anymore. That was enough for them. 
So, it was at a point now that there wa s almo
st no hope, and it is Fela Berlant (ph), the 
schreiberen
, who went with a report to the headquarters and found out that they need 

clerks, office clerks, and came running and told
 us to follow her w
ithout a word, without 
too much commotion that we were able to secu
re a better position th
at brought us into a 
new life Œ a new life that we didn™t even know 
that existed in Birkenau. So, we recovered 
physically, me ntally, for a short duration. So, we had three months of horrible experience, 

and then we had about two and a half m
onths Œ Nove mber, December, until January 14
th
 
Œ that put us back on our feet and we were ab
le to again withstand the difficulties of the 
death ma rch that followed. And this, too, was a 
difficult thing inasmuch as we were in a 
much better situation than anybody else beca
use we had good shoes and we had a warm 
coat and we had gloves and we had scarves a
nd we had hats and we 
had clothes on us. It 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
74 
 
was not like the situation when we fi rst came, the fi rst three months, that  outside of one 
dress, we didn™t have anything. And another 
thing that helped us to pull through that 
period of the death ma
rch was that the Polis
h wome n with whom we wor ked had some 
supplies because they we re always getting some
 food from home. So, th
ey had a little bit 
of sugar that they divided between the peopl
e as we were leaving the camp, and it is the 
combination of snow Œ it was snowing, it was 
cold, it was terrible 
Œ but it was the snow 
that kept  us going because no ma tter how tir
ed you were, you rubbed your face with the 
cold snow, you were mor e  alert, and by mi xing the snow with a little bi
t of sugar, it gave 
you a little bit of energy, whic
h was also very good. But here we had a problem with 
Renia because she just  could not walk. She 
was very sleepy and we knew that no sooner 
will she sit down at the edge of the road Œ there were so many people driven at the time 

from every field, from the men™s area and th
e wome n, so it was whoever sat down or bent 
over or ran into the field to relieve themselv
es or whatever were shot to death Œ and 
Renia couldn™t walk and she started Œ she wa
s delirious Œ and she started hallucinating. 
So, Hania and I grabbed her under her arms and 
we dragged her. As bad as the snow was, 
because it was very cold, it was very conveni
ent for walking because we didn™t really 
have Œ we weren™t forced ma rch and sing lik
e when we were going out to work in the 
fields. We  were all kind of sliding on that 
snow, and Renia didn™t 
have to walk. She was 
just sliding along. And they brought us to a huge
 barn. I reme mber that, and the barn was 
Œ I mean, it was supposed to be a shelter, but 
it wasn™t really a sh elter. It was as huge 
barn where the Nazi soldiers, the SS me n, could 
keep us contained in one area, locked in, 
but the boards were mi ssing and there was 
no roof, you know, and the wind was howling 
and blowing and it was snowing. But we were kind of together for the night, and then we 

ma rched for another two or three days. And dead
 bodies were strewn all over the road, all 
along the road. It was men and women, becau
se so ma ny thousands of people were 
driven out of Auschwitz. Only those who were
 not able to get out of bed rema ined, but 
everybody else was just  driven out of Auschwitz
 until, I think, about 40 kilome ters from 

Auschwitz. They put us on a train. It was 
a flatbed, and it was full of snow, and we 
traveled from that town, I don™t remember the name  of it, but I know it wa s about 40 

kilome ters from Auschwitz, and they took us to Ravensbrück 
 

Q: Let me  go back to Auschwitz for just amo me nt. You so often express a very powerful 
drive to live when you describe 
who you were then. W
e re the 
three of you, since this wa s 
the center of your lives, I™m sure each of you had other friends or people that you knew, 

but I™m assumi ng that this is closest, that group. 
 

A: That was a family. 

 

Q: Were you all sharing equally in that hope, 
or did one of you get less hopeful and the other 
one pull them out?  Do you have any recoll
ection how you operated emotionally together?  
 

A: There was ne ver a di scussion about it. It was 
an instinctive ki
nd of 
a reaction to situation. 
If I was Œ if I was Œ if I could be of more help
 to one particular situ
ation, I did it. If Hania 
was in a situation where she c
ould be of help to the others
, it was the same thing. I don™t 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
75 
 
know what was on my sisters™ mi nds. We  didn™
t have conversations. We
 had each othe r, 
the physical being. There was no conversation. 
I mean, on oc casion, yes, when we could, 
when we we re allowed and we were not beaten and we were not exhausted and when our 
mi nd was functioning in a way that you n
eeded, but what you thought about basically 
were the imme diate needs and how are you going  to ma nage the next day, to pull through 

it, and in what way this is going to happen. I 
know that at one point 
I developed a boil in 
my leg, and they took me  to the infirmary and 
I was in the infirmary for s e veral days Œ I 
don™t know whether it was a week or whatever
 Œ and it was a friend of my  mother™s who 
saw my na me, who was working in that infirm
ary, who was a nurse in that infirmary, and 
when she saw my na me  and asked whether 
I know Pola Laks, I told her, ﬁI™m her 
daughter.ﬂ That she saw to it that I was retu
rned back, when I was through, that I was 
returned back to the sa me barracks from which I came. Because norma lly they never se nd 

you back. They send you to the crematorium if
 you did not recover, and in most cases 
people did not recover, but due to the fact th
at she kind of found out
 that I™m the daughter 
of some one she knew or was fond 
of, that she took care of me  and she sent me  back to 
the barracks. So, I was very fortunate to 
be reunited with my sisters. There was a 
situation where my little sister  disappeared completely and we didn™t see her for 24 

hours, and I don™t even know where she was.
 And, then all of a sudden she appeared, 
but– And whenever I ask her, she says, ﬁI
 don™t know. I just don™t know what happened, 
where I was.ﬂ So, there was this constant fe
ar of ﬁare we going to be together?  Is 

some thing going to happen to us that we ar
e going to be separated?  What is going to 
happen? ﬂ For one reason or a
nother, whatever the situati
on developed good or bad, we 
some how managed to rema in together. It wasn™t
 that we were so smart or that we knew 
how to ma nage. It was really without know
ing, without knowing, and still I™m told today, 
I think it™s providence. I thi
nk there is nothing else that 
one could really
 explain why 
things happened to us the way they did. 
 

Q: You would not describe the three of you as ha
ving a leader in som
e
 way Œ that one of you 
was more– 
 

A: Well, I think that we all shared a certai
n responsibility. On my 
part, I felt that my
 
responsibility is to take care of my two sister
s. I™m sure that they felt the same  way a bout 
me , but there was never a division of duties 
or  whatever. I mean, 
we had our portion of 
food that we shared, and we did not Œ fortunate
ly, we were not confr
onted with any kind 
of a disease that would have separated us
 for a long period, only the boil on my leg, 
which fortunately healed fast and I was return
ed, but otherwise, in the three months that 
we were in Auschwitz Œ Renia was beaten once very, very ba dly because  she dared to dip 

her pan into a cauldron 
with soup as it was delivered to 
the barracks. The deliverers were 
people who went to the kitchen and two peopl
e carried the cauldron of soup. So, she was 
nearby and she had a cup in her hand, and she dipped it, and she was beaten terribly. 
 

Q: Did she have to go to the infirmary? 

 

A: No. She was black and blue and 
swollen, but she didn™t have to go. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
76 
 
 
Q: The day Œ I can™t reme mber was it you a
nd Hania who were going to the new job Œ and 
Renia was behind, right? The 
Block Ältest
e
, who you described as an extremely brutal 
terrible woma n, or a m I  wrong?  Wa s it only the assistant? 
 

A: The assistant was so brutal. It was different. The 
Block Älteste
 was also a Jewish girl 
from Slovakia, but she was a different
 type. She was very Œ ma ybe she had 
understanding, but we did not come  into contact
 with her that much. 
In the admi nistration 
of the barracks, there were those three wome n Œ the 
Block Älteste
 Œ they were all Jewi sh 
wome n who came in at the very early 
stage. So, it was 1942, 1943, you know. Fela was 
the 
schreiberen
. She had a big mouth, and she holleredall day, but she didn™t hit and she 
didn™t beat and her toughness was expressed, you
 know, as I said barking, because this is 
like some  dogs barks and they don™t bite. So, 
basically she didn™t do any harm to anybody 
outside of hollering and then was this othe
r women who never held her arms steady, but 

like a windmill. Her arms were going and whoever was in the way got beat up. And she 

was the one who was insulting and was calling 
us horrible name s, and calling us whores, 
and God knows what. So, when I think about it
 now, and I know that she came with the 

first transport of wome n to Auschwitz, and 
they were 500 or whatever the number was, 
and small number of them rema ined, you know, su
rvived and at the point when we came , 
that she mus t  have been very bitter and b
ecause she lost everybody. She felt that this Œ 
that we have to go through the same  kind 
of a suffering that her group did and she was 
inflicting the pain on us, which gave her the 
security of the job that she had. But there 
was a human aspect to her that I see now that 
I™m older, that basically she didn™t have to 

be so helpful when Hania fainted. She coul
d™ve just walked by without any reaction 
whatsoever, and yet she made sure that she 
revived her by throwing the bucket of water 
and allowing us to stand there, and not be
ing sympathetic or ha
ving any kind words or 
anything. It was all in the same manner, in 
a rude, hollering ma nner. But  I explain it, so 
to say as, the human side of her by sheer
 demonstrating her w
illingness to assist. 
 

Q: Okay, let™s change the tape.

Q: Before we say more about after the deat
h ma
rch to Ravensbrück 
and your experiences up 
until liberation, Chris, explain what the 
Ef f e kt enkammer
 was, this new job that the three 
of you had. You Œ the last time, you talked a
bout how i mportant it was for you, what it 
did in terms of changing your self-ima ge, and 
feelings of self-esteem with the people you 
were working for. I also want to know wh
ether you understood the place of that work 
kommando
 in the structure of Auschwitz, how 
Auschwitz was being organized, or did 
you simply know the structure of that particular 
kommando
? 
 

A: I wasn™t even fa miliar Œ I didn™t even know that a 
kommando
 like this exists. About 
Kanada we heard, because of all the belongings
 of the Jewish tran
sports were going to 
Kanada, where the good things were separate
d from the worn things and sent to Nazi 
Germany. But I never knew th
ere was such a thing of 
Effektenkammer
, where Christ ian 
Polish women were employed and they were 
in charge of the belongings of political 
prisoners that were brought. Everybody had a 
different assignme nt. There were groups. 
Like, there was, again, the admi nistrative part
 of the operation; th
ere was the group that 
was storing the clothes; ther
e was the group that was– kept
 whatever other belongings 
were. My job was with another girl, a Chri
stian girl Œ her name  was Ioasha, Ioasha 
Haborra (ph) Œ and we were in charge of su
itcases. So, I walked into the room, a large 

room that had lots and lots of shelves, 
and the shelves were full of different sizes 
suitcases. None of them were real large. So
me  were satchels, some  were like knapsack 
kind of canvas bags, and some  were a small suitcase and all of that. We  we re very 

welcome by the group, the 20 Jewish wome n, or
 25 Jewish wome n who we re sent to 
replace the other Œ other Polish women who were
 sent on transport, and they treated us 
very, very we ll. I think I me ntioned before 
that they were mostly intelligent women, 
educated wome n and they were very kind to
 us. We found out late
r on that there were 
ma ny a mong them who were Jews on assume d pa
pers. So, I would say that we were like 
50/50 or ma ybe even mo re Jews, but some  of them were under false papers and 

considered themselves Christian, I mean, cons
ider ed themselves as Poles rather  than 
Polish Jews. The job we had to do was, when
 a person was released from Auschwitz, a 
Polish political prisoner, that 
we had to ma ke sure that 
the belongings she brought, that 
her personal belongings that 
she brought Œ her clothes a
nd so forth and so Œ were 
transferred with her, or if sh
e was released from the camp, that everything went with her 
as well. During this period that we worked t
ogether, we had to gain
 the confidence of the 
Polish women that were there be fore becau
se, as we were getting more and more 
acquainted, and as the undergr
ound activities were kind of in
creasing and there was more 
contact with the outside, that 
we had to be part and parcel
 of what was happening, and I™ll 
give you an example. There were wome n 
who we re working in very important 
departme nts, and it™s only there that we
 found out what was happening. There were 
women who had access to the lists of daily tr
ansports. There were wome n who worked in 
the laboratory were Dr. Mengele was doing 
experime nts on the children, and they had 
every record what was being done to the children and so forth, and other very important 

operations performe d by the Nazi on the 
campsite to which nobody was privy and it 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
78 
 
never left the camp. And yet, through this 
Eff e
kt enkammer
, every once in a while, a list 
came in, a piece of paper came in that I never witnessed openl y where I would be able to 
read or see what was written, but let™s say on 
two occasions Ioasha and I had to rip apart 
a suitcase and glue in a letter, an enve lope,into the lining of the suitcase or place an 

envelope once in the bottom of a pocketbook. 
And it went with the person that was 
released from ca mp. Now, how did I know what
 we were doing?  We  were just told that 
this is a mi ssion that we have to fulfill a
nd that we  should not ask any questions. How did 
they find out about it?  I reme mber, there 
was a wo ma n Krystyna Jevulska (ph), an 
inmate, and she was a Jewish woman from 
the Lodz. But she came to Aus c hwitz under 
an assume d name  as a political Œ Krystyna Jevu
lska (ph) Œ as a political prisoner, and she 
had contacts on the outside. The fa mily that 
she maintained contact with was sending to 
her packages, food packages, monthly so nobody could suspect that she wa s Jewish, 

because if you have family outside and they
 send you food packages, then you definitely 
Œ Jews did not have anybody who wa s sendingdaily packages. And I reme mber one day 

Œ we ate together most of the time. We didn™t have to stand on 
Zählappel
, and sometimes 
we didn™t eat the food for the camp, but they
 give us some  provi
sions that we could 
prepare a meal by ourselves. We  were a sm
all group. So, I reme mber one day, a package 
came for Kr ysia Jevulska (ph), and in the p
ackage was a hard-boiled egg, and the joy and 
the happiness was indescribable. I mean 
we didn™t know why was everybody so excited. 
Well, after a while when things had simmered do
wn, we were told that in that letter Œ in 
one of the letters, I don™t know which one, whet
her the one in the su
itcase or the one in 
the pocketbook that was sent out, a me ssage wa s 
sent to the fa mily that was sending to 
packages to Krysia that if they receive this 
letter Œ because of course there was important 
information that had to be sent out in that co
ncealed envelope Œ that 
if they receive this 
information that should include in the food p
ackage that they are sending one hard-boiled 
egg, which will be an indication that they know
 what is going on and that they received 
it. So, in a wa y, it was so important to know that
 in all that horrible 
experience that each 
and every person that was incarcerated went 
through, that some  news about what was 
going on in camp was reaching the outside wo rld. I mean, I™m only talking about the 

departme nt of the suitcases. In what other 
ways things were smuggled out, I don™t know. 
I™m sure that they never used the same  syst
e m, because they would be caught sooner or 
later. So, there must have been different 
departme nts. Departme nts must have been 
sending news  out. That was, so to say, th
e only possible way of contacting Œ for the 
inmates to contact the outside, the outside worl d. 
 

Q: But, it must have been very complicated 
because, if you are only
 having the property of 
inm
a
tes who are there, and they get them b
ack when they leave, so whoever in the 
underground or the resistance in Auschwitz wa
nts to get information out, they have to 
know who™s leaving. 
 

A: No, the idea was that the person who was leav
ing, they would never 
put som
e thing with a 
person who was not trustworthy. And the woma
n was told that, once 
you are out of camp, 
this is Œ you have some thing in the suitcase or
 in the pocketbook or wherever. They never 
Œ for her not to be afraid, I™m sure they di
dn™t tell her where exactly it is, I mean, in 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
79 
 
which place and how to do it, but they must ha
ve told her that some
where Œ I mean, it™s 
not that I did, you know, it™s how I knew about 
it Œ that she was aware of taking out of 
camp some t hing that was very important fo
r the people who were outside to know, and 
this is how we got the hard-boiled egg. Th
at was only one time in my be ing in that 
Effektenkammer
 which was just unbelievable. But we
 had a wonderful three months that, 
as I said before, that we regained not only our
 physical strength but our self-esteem, a nd 
it gave us hope that some how th
ere is a chance that we™ll be able to come out of this hell. 
 
Q: Do you remember you and your friend being told
 by a particular person to put this letter 
into th
is pur
se? 
 

A: Oh,sure. 

 

Q: Do you know who it was?  

 

A: It was Œ alwa ys, there were people who we
re in charge. There was Maria, who was the 
capo, she was a Polish Œ she was a Polish polit
ical prisoner, a very
 wonderful person. 
 

Q: What was her last name ?  Do you reme mber?   

 

A: [Shakeshead.] 

 

Q: She was the head of the 
Effektenkam
m
er
, or she was–?  
 
A: She was the head of the 
Effektenkamm
er,
 of the fifty wome n who worked there. Maria, 
and she Œ why I know Maria because Krystyna
 Jevulska (ph)  was writing poetry, and she 
wrote a poem about all the people who were invo
lved in different jobs, and she described 
them Œ who they were and what they did, a
nd her poetry was also sent out. She passed 
away. She lived in Germany after the war. 
She™s gone, too. It™s a shame, you know?  I had 
the last interview with her that  was done in
 the ‚80s. She was sick by then with cancer, 

and she really gave the interview of her 
life, you know, who s he was Œ the Jewish girl 
from Lodz, Landa was her name , her last name , a nd she came to live in Warsaw and how 

she was arrested in Wa rsaw and her contact
s with all the people. I think she was a 
Communist, a me mber of the 
Communist party. She was like 
Œ I would say she was the 

inverse of a university student right before 
the war, and university students had all kinds 
of organizations and Jews were not very 
welcome in too ma ny organizations, university 
organizations. So, most of the young Jewish peop
le were so infatuated with the ideology 
of Communi sm that I think she was one of 
the members. She speaks about it br iefl y in 
that interview, but not much. Beau
tiful woma n, just great personality. 
 

Q: Were there ever selections in the 
E
ffektenkammer
? 
 

A: Never. 
 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
80 
 
Q: So you very quickly felt safe?  
 

A: Imme diately, there was never a selection. Ther
e wa
s only a fear of being transferred to a 
different camp. And, there was no guaranteebecause the other, the Polish wome n who 

we replaced, they felt very secure there. Th
ere were no selections, but they took them out 
because they wanted to bring a new element so
 they shouldn™t feel so ve ry comfortable 
with each other. The Nazis must have suspect
ed that some thing is going on there. Pl us 
they had contact with the me n outside of the camp. The 
Effekt enkammer
 was near 
Kanada and therefore, the unloading of th
e– There was a lot of
 moving around there. 
 

Q: Did you ever Œ a woma n by the name of Katya Songer ever come  into your 
Effektenkam
m
er
? She was head of the camp offices. 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Or a wo ma n  name s Tsipi?  

 

A: [Shakeshead] 

 

Q: Did you ever hear the camp orchestra?  

 

A: Sure. We  they were playing when 
we were ma rching out and ma rching in.  

 

Q: Did that anger you, bother you, was it 
good m
usic?
 Do you reme mber anything?  
 

A: You know, when you are kind of brainwashed th
at this is the way to function and you get 
used to that routine and 
you hear that orchestra alr
eady and you know that you are 
approaching the barracks and pretty soon you™
ll get your ration of bread. That was the 
most welcome thing I would say. I don™t know
 whether it was or it wasn™t, but that™s 
another thing, the orchestra. 
They perform
e d for the Nazis 
with concerts of Wa gner and 
then they played ma rches for the groups 
leaving the camps. I don™t really reme mber 
exactly. I reme mber the orchestra, I reme mber
 the ma rches, but that™s all I reme mber 
about it. I reme mber when Mala committed, cu
t her veins, when she was caught after she 
escaped and she was brought back, because
 they called everybody to witness her 

hanging. When we were in 
Effektenkammer,
 or no, when we were in 
Effektenkammer,
 
there was another hang
ing of the courageous four wome n who were bringing in Rosa 
Robota, and Sapirstein, and We isblum, the 
four girls who we re working with the 
explosives and they were bringing each day to
 camp and giving it to 
and giving it to the 
Sonderkommando
, so they could build a bomb and blow up the crematorium. But we did 

not really actually witness it. So, you know, 
there were so many different activities of 
courage and trying to ma ke the world aware wh
at is happeni ng and what is taking pl ace. 

Some  of the news came out, because after al
l, young Karski came  to the United States, 
and I love that ma n. I me an it™s unbelievable 
how courageous that ma n was  to be able to 

be smuggled into a camp  and out and be an 
eyewitness and bring the news to Britain and 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
81 
 
bring the news to Roosevelt in
 the Un
ited States without a no
te on him. He had to commit 
everythi ng to me mory because he couldn™t do 
it any other wa y. And the courage of that 
ma n to do it and then to be so disappointed 
that it took so long before some  action was 
taken on the part of the British and the Americ
an governme nt to some how assist and help 
in this situation or find an answer to whatev
er or to send airplanes to bomb or whatever. 
It wouldn™t have ma ttered if some  of the inma
tes would have been killed in the process, 
because we were all dying. One way or anot
her we would have been dead. But they 
would have discovered in 1944 about the at
rocities and how ma ny millions of people 
were killed and they could have stopped, 
even if they had do
ne it in 1944, you know, 
hundreds of thousands of people could have lived. 
 

Q: Did you think when you were there, 
why isn™t the world doing som
e
thing?  
 

A: Yeah, I thought about it Œ why the world is
n™t doing some thing, why God allows for it to 
happen. I mean, there™s all kinds of things 
that go through your mi
nd. Again, I™m going to 
say that you just have so much time to 
think. Otherwise, you are like a robot.  
 

Q: You just keep going. Or you don™t. 

 

A: That™s it. I mean, one track mi nd. If I do su
ch and such, ma
ybe I™ll 
get to the end of the 
tunnel. 
 

Q: In you description, it appears 
as if you Œ if you and your sister
s hadn™t gotten a job in the 
Effektenkamm
er
, who knows?  You were – 
 

A: We wouldn™t have survived. 

 

Q: You wouldn™t have survived?  

 

A: No, definitely not, because at this point 
another two weeks, and I don™t know who would 
have broken down first, but anyone of us, if 
one of us was gone then
 the other two would 
have followed, and it doesn™t re
a
lly matter in which order. 
 

Q: Was there anything else about the 
Ef
fektenkammer
 that you wa nted to? 
 

A: I think that this is pr etty much what we want
 to cover and the me
re f
act that when we left 
the _______________ the 
Effektenkammer,
 we were dressed warmer and so forth, and it 
was easier to cope with the death ma rch which was not easy again, and was very difficult 

emotionally and physically and all that, and 
finally, when we arrived in Ra vensbrück, I 
don™t know whether the trip on the 
train was for two days or for three days or whatever it 
was, we were brought again for registration, 
because there were not norma lly a transport 
that was transferred, had papers and the numbe
r of inma tes and so forth. This was such a 
disarray that no docume nts followed us. S
o, we had to register again, and as we 
approached the registration desk, right then a
nd there, we decided we are going to change 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
82 
 
our name s to Christian name s. So, we becam
e Œ we assume
d the last name  Gorska, and 
the first name Œ Hania and Reina remained
 the same  Œ and I changed my name  to 
Krystina because I wanted to have a true Chri
stian name , and my sisters called me  Krysia 
because it™s a nickname  for Krystina, and until
 this day I™m Krysia to my sisters and 
Krysia to my nieces and nephews and to my 
grandchildren, because they hear ﬁKrysi a, 
Krysiaﬂ and they like the sound of it. 
 

Q: Did other Jewish wome n do the same  thing?  

 

A: I don™t know. It just happened. Some ti me s a
ll those things Œ you don™
t plan anything. 
W
e  
didn™t plan anything. We  didn™t have a strate
gy to follow. Everything was on an impulse. 
You either took advantage of a situation, ma
ybe, if you knew what was happening or just 
sheer coincidence, but here we knew that, 
after we were with the Polish women, the 
Polish 
kommando
, we knew that Polish political prisone
rs have a better chance to survive 
than the Jews, but it didn™t ma tter when 
we came to Ravensbrück. Ravensbrück was 
designed for 20,000 wome n and there were 
80,000 of us when we came in. The 
conditions were deplorable. There was no st
anding room. It was some thing awful, and 
after the death ma rch, even though we had wa
rme r  clothes and ev
erything, we wouldn™t 
have lasted more than two weeks in Ra
vensbrück, between the beating and no food 
whatsoever and the tortur es that were inf
licted on us by the camp inma tes, by the capos, 
by the 
Aufseherinnen
, the SS women in uniform Œ it was 
just unbelievable. So, I kind of 
block out completely Ravensbrück from my 
mi nd because it was of short duration and 
the only thing that I reme mber of Ravensbrüc
k was that we changed our name s. That™s 
the only thing. And the next thing I reme mber
 from Ravensbrück is that the uniforme d 
me n walked into the barracks and aske d for 
50 volunteers. And because, as I said, there 

was standing room only and we were always 
Œ we never pushed like 
other people, so we 
were always the last ones to come  in, alwa
ys in the draft and 
near door and God knows 
where. So we were sitting on the floor 
and I turn to Hania and I say, ﬁWhat do you 
think? ﬂ And she says, ﬁLet™s go.ﬂ And then we came  to the conclusion, because he said 

he™s comi ng the following morning for the 
volunteers, he took everybody™s name  and 
that™s it, and then I said to Hania, ﬁWell,
 do you think we did the right thing? ﬂ And we  
came to the conclusion that if we rema in in Ravensbrück, we  are for sure dying within 

two or three weeks. If this 50 volunteers are going
 to be taken to die or to be killed, then 
it will happen imme diately, but there is also 
a chance that they need 50 volunteers to go 
to work somewhere else. And he came in the morning and picked up the 50 volunteers, 

they put us on the truck, and they were 
all wome n from all over. There was a woman 
from Hunga ry, and a woman from Yugoslavia,
 and from Cze c hoslovakia, and we were 
Polish from Poland, and they were Ge rman 
women, I mean Jewish German wome n, and 
we all were on the truck and we were trave
ling for a half hour, for an hour, and we were 
still on the truck. Nobody stopped the truck. 
So, after two hours,
 we came to the 
conclusion, we looked at each other and we cam
e to the conc lusion that they didn™t have 
to drag us for that long to kill us, that we 
are going some where where they want to make 

use of us one way or another. So, they brought us to Retzow. Retzow was a military 

camp. It was a Luftwaffe , the air force, 
that was br ought back because it was in 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
83 
 
Mecklenberg, which was the northern part of 
Germany close to the Baltic Sea between 
Lübeck and Ha
mburg, and they needed people to 
work in the airfield to dig ditches Œ not 
ditches, but trenches and so forth, and do th
e work and cleaning. So, the first transport 
that arrived was basically for 
admi nistrative jobs or for clean
ing offices. So, they were 
the ones like the girls from Slovakia who were
 experienced admi nistrators, so they got 
the good jobs, and we took whatever it was. Hania was cleaning offices and Renia was 
like a va let to a German SS woma n, and I was 
also cleaning offices, and Hania tells this 
very nice story from Retzow that she was 
cleaning offices. Among the space that she had 
to clean was the office of one of the officers,
 and he always left papers, and he had the 
radio there and everything. And 
Hania, realizing the situati
on, that papers are always 
there, pr etended that she doesn™t speak any 
German. So, he™s talking to her and he™s 

telling her what to do. So, she says, ﬁNicht ve
rsteinﬂ (ph) and Œ Hani
a tells this story and 
I always laugh about it Œ ﬁNicht versteinﬂ 
(ph), which means in kind of a broken way, ﬁI 
don™t understand anythi ng.ﬂ Because no sooner di
d he go out, she went to look at what 
was on the desk or she listened to the radi
o. So, one day he was still suspicious. He 
wanted to know what™s going on. So, he come
s in and she™s there on the floor scrubbing 
the floor with a brush, and mopping up the floor, 
and he says to her, you know, he wanted 
to catch her, ﬁDid you hear what they a
nnounced on the radio? ﬂ And she says, ﬁNicht 
verstein.ﬂ So, he looks at her with contem
pt and she says, ﬁSo gross ker faxen and so 
domﬂ  (ph) which means, ﬁSo gross ker faxenﬂ 
(ph) Œ so tall, because Œ and so stupid. So, 
this is Hania™s favorite story from it, but sh
e heard every bit of news every day. When she 
came in the morning, that was the first room she had to clean. So, she heard the news and 

then she went to work. And Renia, because 
she was kind of a valet to the SS woma n who 
was in charge of the entire group of supervis
ing wome n in camp, so she liked Renia a lot, 
and she says, ﬁHow can I help you?  W
ould you like to have some  food?  Are you 
hungry? ﬂ And this, and, Renia says to her, 
ﬁNot really. I don™t want you to give me  
anything, but my mi ddle sister is
 a very good cook, and if you just
 could see to it that my 
mi ddle sister gets a job in the kitchen, then it 
will be just wonderful.ﬂ So, she went to the 
chef and she told him that she has a gi rl that
 she would like to work
 in the kitchen, that 
she™s a very good cook and that
 she knows how to prepar
e good food, and for the food 
especially that Œ not for the camp food, but fo
r the SS people. So, they gave me  a job in 

the kitchen, and the kitchen was whatever had 
to be done. Either I was in charge of the 
big kettle where we cooked for camp, or I wa
s preparing hamburgers for the German me n 

in uniform that were in the Air Force, or we
 used to cook that fa
rina every morning for 
breakfast for the military. So, that was good because you couldn™t be hungry anymore, 

and we were cutting up the bread that was ra
tioned for the eventual groups of people that 
came after us. We  were the first ones. We  
were there for a few days, and they brought 
about a few thousand wome n to do the outside
 work. I reme mber once there were girls 
sweeping the floor outside and I was standi
ng and frying hamburgers for lunch or for 
dinner for the Germans, and I saw the girls outsi
de the fence. It wasn™t very far and the 
window was big and wide open, and I was flippi
ng the hamburgers and I was every once 
in a while flipping one outside, and so help
 me , I still reme mb er, there is a woma n who 
lives in Miami and she™s Hania, also Hania, 
and she always says, ﬁI grabbed one of those 
hamburgers you threw out the window.ﬂ So, you know, you didn™t have to Œ you just had 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
84 
 
to be there to take advantage of every little
 situation, and you know, it didn™t do Œ I mean, 
I haven™t done any heroic deeds. I saw peopl
e are there. I figu
red 
whoever grabs it will 
grab it.  
 
Q: What would any–?  

 

A: The chef was not in. 

 

Q: So, nobody saw?  

 

A: So, nobody saw, and whoever was in charge wa
s an inm
a
te like myself. So, if she was 
angry or mean, she could have done me  in, but
 the chef wasn™t there. So, I figured, all 
right. 
 

Q: Of course, some  functionary could have 
been watching a hamburger fly out the window. 

 

A: Could have been, but I don™t 
think that I would have taken th
at much of a
 risk if I would 
have seen there is a danger because, I mean, th
ere is a little logic to
 doing things, and it 
wasn™t happening every day. It ju
st Œ this particular situation, 
because there™s st ill this girl 
who always remi nds how I was throwing out the hamburger, and how she was lucky to 

grab one off the ground. 
 

Q: Were you able to some how get food so 
you could bring it to 
your two sisters?  
 
A: 
Always, that was my job. That was really
 my
 job because in the beginning, I was in 
charge of the kettle, th
e big kettle. So, what we did is 
we were lighting the fi re Œ ther e 
was like a huge, huge metal container, and 
under it was where the fire was burning, and 
we had to all night we had to feed Œ I mea
n, the wood, place the wood so that the kettle 
would be cooking. So, this meat, to prepare a meat base for a soup, you had to cook it for 
hours and hours because I don™t think it was beef
, I think it was horse meat at the time . 
And that was prepared for the soldiers. So, th
ere were several of us who rema ined in the 
kitchen all ni ght, not all the time because 
there were shifts, you know, some ti me s one 
group of women and someti mes another group 
of wome n. The week that I was working 
at night with the other wome n, 
then at four o™clock in the morning, we were separated 
from the camps because, due to the fact that we were cooking for the soldiers and 

cleaning for the soldiers, they
 didn™t want us to live in
 the campsite. But under the 
kitchen in the baseme nt, they set up cots for 
us to sleep in and wash and keep ourselves 
clean. So, in the morning, like at four o™clock 
in the morning, before the chef came in, we 
used to have aprons Œ big, heavy canvas apr
ons Œ so one of the girls was standing there 
with a hook fishing out the tongs and the other sm
all parts of the meat that we were able 
to get out, and put it in the ap
ron, in one of the aprons, and tw
o of us we re on the look-out 
each way, and one was running with that hot stuff in that canva s apron. We used to come  

in Œ We were all in one room, the 50 of us
, all in one room. So, we dump ed it like on 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
85 
 
whatever it was, I don™t reme mb
er, whether on the bed or on 
the table and we started to 
rip it apart and eat it. 
 
Q: So, all 50 of you, as ma ny as could share would share?  

 

A: Yes. There was always enough. Then, I mean, 
when I wasn™t in the kitchen at night, I 
reme
mber how we worked Œ but there were ot
her girls that were on that shift, you know, 
then they did it. So, this is the way we su
rvived in Retzow. And then, of course, we 

started to see the airplanes flying, and I reme
mbe r  when they threw leaflets, and they 
were announced that Roosevelt passed aw
ay and Harry Truman became President, 
because we came to Retzow in February. We  
came at the end of January to Ravensbrück, 
and two weeks later, like end of February, a
nd this must have been March or April. I 
don™t reme mber when Roosevelt passed away. This I reme mber, and they were alwa ys 

sounding the sirens because of the fear of the 
attacks from the  air, and so, I was watching 
the wome n. We were all so happy when we 
saw those silver planes. It was such a 
delightful thing, and especially when it wa
s on a weekend, on a Sunday, when we didn™t 
work, because there was no personnel there. A
nd the way people reacted to situations, 
you know?  Hania used to get a hold of any f
ood that was availabl
e and she was eating 
and eating and eating and eati
ng like there was no tomorrow. There wasn™t a problem 
anymore with food, as I me ntioned to you, because I was working near food and we were 

not that starved. There was anot
her girl Œ this wa s also a very unusual kind of a thing Œ 

but she used to fill a bucket with water,
 undressed completely, and she stood there and 
she was washing her body. For the duration of that period, from the time when the alarms 

sounded until the alarm sounded again that it™s 
over, she stood there and she was washing 
from head to toe, just pouring water on her 
as if to cleanse herself from God knows what. 
And you wa tch people behave in situations th
at are so strange, a
nd you can™t figure out 
why people would do such things, a nervous 
reaction of one kind or another. Hania™s 
eating was not because she was hungry. It was 
a nervous reaction, and of course, before 
long, we find out that the war was over. It was 
the beginning of May Œ fourth or fifth of 
May Œ when we could see that the whole thing 
is getting out of cont
rol, even the people 
who were in charge of the camp were 
not paying much attention, and everybody was 
trying to kind of escape. We
 were getting packages by then the Count Bernadotte has 
arranged through the Red Cross to send packag
es to inma tes in different campsites like 
Bergen-Belsen and whatever was close by. So, th
ey were care packages that came, and in 
the care packages was chocolate and cigarett
es. So, the Nazis took out
 the cigarettes and 
chocolate and distributed the rest of the food Œ crackers, sardines, whatever was there, 

which was okay, ma ybe it was better, because 
otherwise we would have gotten si ck, God 
knows what, and then Renia, Hania knowing 
what was going on and Renia sensing from 
that woman for whom she worked that someth
ing is going to happen 
soon, all of a sudden 
is very patronized by that woma n. The war ma y 
e nd soon, and after all, it hasn™t been so 
bad in camp, and if a question come s up that Œ how the Germans behaved, I hope you are 

going to give a kind word - this kind of a th
ing, these kinds of conversations. By then, 
they were trying to kind of save their own sk
in. Then, they came  in the morning and they 
said the came is being evacu
ated. Now, where evacuated, nobody knew. Now, I find out 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
86 
 
that this constant moving from one camp to th
e other was for the Nazis to save their own 
skin, because if they wouldn™t ha
ve had th
e prisoners to move them around, they would 
have been compelled to go to the front, and they
 wanted to save their lives. So, as long as 
they were in charge of the pr
isoners, they had a very legitima
te excuse why they have to 
rema in. But by then, when we saw they were 
losing control of anything that is happening, 
and we were taken out from the camp and we ca
me to that main road that led to this 
community, there was so much going on. Pe
ople from everywhere going in every 
direction with little wagons loaded with
 household belongings and God knows, and you 
could see uniforms , German unifor ms, thrown
 along the road. People were trying to get 
into civilian clothes to escape,
 not to be caught in uniform. 
So, it was just a horrible thing 
and we were driven and driven
 and driven and then, and the 
Aufseherin
 for whom Re nia 
worked, she had that knapsack full of cigare
ttes, and she had her big cape and she had 
other things that she carried, 
and we all had a little bag 
with whatever. We had some  
sardines and some crackers, as I said before. 
And she says to Renia that it™s hot and she 

would like for her to carry the cape for her.
 So, Renia took the cape 
from her and threw it 
over her arm and we were just ma rching. And 
in the group that left Retzow was Helen Œ 
Helena, and I don™t know from where she was 
or we didn™t know her for too long of a 
time, but she was a tall, blonde woman name
d Helena, and she too had a big mouth, and 
she spoke German very well. So, she saw Re
nia holding on to that cape. So, she ma de 
sure that we lagged behind a bit, and before
 we had a chance to look around, she had the 
cape over her camp clothes and she wa s holleri
ng ﬁGet out, and get out of my way and 
get out of my way.ﬂ And, she was pushing and pushing and pushing, pushing us towards 

the woods, the small group of wome n. There wa
s like a little forest
, and because there 
were civilians and there were the camp pris
oners and there were the Germans who were 
trying, some in uniform and some already 
in civilian clothes, there was such a 
commotion, there was so much comi ng and 
going, you couldn™t figure out what was 
happening. But we wound up in the mi ddle of th
e forest by night. So, we ma de a fire, a 

very small fire so that it wasn
™t visible. We  were very deep 
in the forest by then, and we Œ 
I don™t reme mber Œ to keep ourselves wa
rm. How we opened the sardines I don™t 
reme mber, but we had some  of the sardines and in the morning, we got up and we 

walked. By then, it was quiet already. We
 kind of wound up on the other side of the 
forest instead of near the road. And ther
e was a huge, huge estate with a ma gnificent 
home  on top, and people were working in the fi
eld. And we came out of the forest and we 
saw the people, so we figured well, if there ar
e workers in the field, ma ybe they will he lp 
us in whatever way. Usually the fieldworkers 
were also either prisoners from a camp, but 
from the distance, we didn™t know who they 
really were. And they 
noticed us and they 
saw us with the tags with the numbers a
nd everything. So, they came running and they 
asked where we are from, and there was a 
guy who was from Kielce, and Kielce was the 
city to where Starachowice belonged; it was part
 of the district. And 
of course he says, 
ﬁNosha polachki!ﬂ (ph) ﬁOur 
Polish girls,ﬂ you know?  So, when we heard that, we didn™t 
even admit that we are not Polish, that we ar
e Jewish, Jewish Poles, I mean, Polish Jews, 
and due to the fact that we already had our 
name s changed, so we could pretend that. So, 
I was Krysia and Hania and Renia, and ther
e must have been ma ybe twenty me n and 
wome n wor king in the field, and this ma n from
 Kielce he wa s in charge of the working 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
87 
 
group, and he says, ﬁOh, did you come from ca mp
?  Poor girls, poor gi
rls. You must have 
suffered so much. Com
e  with me  to the hous
e.ﬂ And we went up to
 the house, and the 
house Œ the only person who was left in th
e house was the German woma n who was in 
charge of the operation, because the graph (
ph) or  whatever was down there Œ I mean, it 
was a ma nsi on. It was such a huge estate that
 it didn™t belong just to a wealthy ma n. It 
belonged to a very, very impor
tant, I would say, kind of indi
vidual. So, he come s in and 
brings us and we are dirty and tired and I don™t 
have to tell you what it™s like being on the 
road for so long. And he says to her, ﬁThese 
are my girls, and you ma ke sure that they are 
Œ that they ge t clean and washed and prepare fo
r them the best meal there is.ﬂ An outright 
order from a person that was only a fiel
d worker, but because nobody was around and he 
saw most likely what was happening, so that 
woma n was very, very frightened. We  were 
three and there was a Russian girl and there 
was Helen and I think there were two more 
girls, I don™t reme mber exactly how ma ny of us 
were in there. Now, I had a piece of soap 
to Œ and got into a bathtub with such fa ncy 
fittings and all that and a terrycl oth towel to 
wipe myself, and then we were brought into 
the dining room, after we were all cleaned up 
and we walked around a little in the field. A
nd the people who were working in the field 
were not allowed to come  into the house. It was off li mits to them, but this ma n somehow 

felt that now he™s in charge because he  was 
the head of the working crew and the owners 

were not around and the whole place was empt
y with the exception of this one woma n. 
So then we come  into the dining room 
and Œ this is funny, but you know how things 
change from one to the next Œ so, here™s th
at huge dining room with a banquet table with 
the upholstered furniture and the heavy drapes
, beautiful white drapes hanging from the 
huge, huge windows. It™s a beautiful estate, a
nd that woma n i s  so frightened and she™s 
bringing bread sliced up and th
en she™s bringing butter in, a
nd the butter is laid out in 
little patties with the family crest. [Bur
sts out laughing.] I™m laughing because it™s 
ridiculous. It seems like it™s in the movies. 
With the crest of the fa mily on the butter– 
And then she brings the food. I don™t reme mber
 what we ate but what strikes me  very 
funny is here I am again in the dining roomwith her with a dama sk cloths on the table 

with the fancy china and with the napkins and even the family cres
t on the butter, which 

we did not have at home but the table was al
ways set for eating in a proper ma nner. So, 
here, in addition to what I reme mbered fr
om home from a way back, was that butter 
which was cut in small pi eces with the family 
crest on it. In my home  we had a beautiful 
butter dish with a cover. It was because th
e butter came in a block. So, it was a personal 
dish with the block of butter 
in it. It was either a block 
or an oval, depending on where 
you bought it. If you bought it in the ma rket fresh 
from the peasant, it was always like an 
egg, a large egg-shaped thing they kept in l
eaves for it to stay cold, you know, when they 

brought it from the village and it had a cover ov
er it. So, that was kind of a reme mbrance 
of what it was last being at home and findi
ng ourselves in this environment all over 
again. And we were there for about four or 
five days, because we were liberated by the 
Russians, I mean, this area was liberated by 
the Russians. And the Russian officers came  
to check on the inventory, to take over as fa
r as livestock is con
cerned and everything 
else, and they found us and inasmuch as th
e officers. So, jabusky (ph) Œ immediately, 
they wanted to ma ke sure that we come  to 
work for them. So, the ma n who was in charge 
of the working group came  and said, ﬁ We are going to home and you are comi ng with us. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396

We are all going to ma ke our way back to Po
land.ﬂ So, that was May Œ first week in May 
of 1945.  
 
Q: So, your first meal after the war starts, wh
en you go back home, is a for
mal meal wi th 
whatever you had, and then you end 
your experience in even more–?  
 

A: In Germany. The war experience, and th
en the journey home starts. Also, not an 
uneventful Œ a very eventful journey hom
e . 
 

Q: We have to change the tapes.

Q: Chris, can you tell us
 who™s in this picture?  
 

A: 
In the back row, from the left, is my A
unt Lodza (ph), who was my father™s sister. She 
m
a rried a man during the war, and they both 
died Œ they were both taken to camps and 
killed. Next to her, leaning on my father™s 
shoulder, is Aunt Re gi
na. She was a beautiful 
woma n. She  was a wonderful, wonderful, full of
 verve and just an exciting person. She 
was just beautiful. She too was ma rried during 
the war, and she and her husband perished 
also. There is my father who, when we we
re brought to Auschwitz, he was separated 
fr om us. He lived until the end of October, and the day he was taken Œ after his selection 

Œ to the gas chamber, we  finally located him.
 Unfortunately, it was 
too late. Inasmuch as 
we sent him the letter to him to let him know 
that we are alive. I guess that if he knew 
that we were still around, ma ybe he would 
have had the strength 
to live through the war 
as well. That was October 1944 when we were already in 
Effektenkommer
 and we had the 
ability to ma ke contact with him. Then fu
rther down is my Aunt Rosha. She was the 

youngest of my mother™s sisters. Regina wa
s also my mother™s sister. Rosha was my 
mother™s sister. She attended the university. 
She was a student of Œ she was a pharmacist 
when she graduated from college, and she tooperished. Next to her is Dora who Œ the 

dark lady Œ who was my  father™s sister. Sh
e survived the war. She was in camp in 
Plaszow. She lived in Sosnowiec and went 
to Plaszow camp. Now, below here is my 

Aunt Angia, who again is my mother™s sist
er, and she was a single woman and she also 

perished in the war. Then come s my Gra
ndma Sa rah, who was widowed in the ‚30s, and 
this is the mother of my mother, and sh
e was a very intelligent woma n, and a very 
educated woma n, and when she ma rried my
 grandpa, Leibush (ph) Tannenblum, she 
became very, very religious, and anyt hing about religion that I know is because, in 

katshrut
 (ph), in observances, is because she 
always wanted to know how much I know 
about being Jewish and leading a Jewish life 
and she was always teaching me  whenever I 
was comi ng for a visit. And next to her is my 
sister Hania, who is sitting in my mother™s 
lap, and Hania must have been a year, a li
ttle older ma ybe, my mo
ther holding onto her. 
And, that™s the fa mily. So, as you see from 
the whole group, there is Dora on the extreme 
right in the standing row be
hind and Hania who is the 
baby. Everybody else perished. 
 

Q: And, this one?  

 

A: In this one is my father, Isaac Laks, and my
 mother, Pola Tannenblum
 Laks. It m
ust have 
been at the very early stage, could have been
 at the time that they were engaged ma ybe or 

ma ybe right after the wedding, but that was when they were very, very young. Even my 

mother™s hair kind of tells me  she could have s
till been a maiden at that time rather than a 
ma r r i e d  w o ma n .  
 

Q: And this picture?  

 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
90 
 
A: In this pi cture are the three girls, the three 
sisters, Hania is of c
ourse the tall one. She was 
always very tall and very attractive, and she 
Œ that was in the wintertime, of course. It 
must have been a Hanukkah present or som
e
thing Œ a new sweater and a new hat and a 
new scarf Œ and she refused to wear a coat; sh
e wanted to wear the sweater. And then it™s 
me . I™ m the one in the mi ddle, and then it™s Renia the youngest sister.  
 
Q: Can you tell us Œ do you know how old you each are there?  

 

A: Well, I would say some where around Œ I could 
have been ten, I guess. There is no date on 
it. That picture was sent to our Uncle Mois
h in the United States, 
and I don™t have the 
original. My cousins m
a
de a copy for us, and th
ey sent it to me . So, ma ybe the original 
has some  kind of inscription on it with a date
, but this one doesn™t have it. So, I™m not  
certain, but Renia is Œ I guess th
at Renia is about six. So, I am
 about ten Œ Renia is about 
six and a half, and so I™m ten and a 
half, and Hania is three years old. 
 

Q: And, this picture? 

 

A: This picture Œ this is the old house that 
we lived in, I would say, up to 1935 or 36 or 
som
e
thing like that. And we moved out of this
 house to a new apartment because this was 
really in a bad condition by then. I mean, inasmuch as it was very comfor table on the 

outside, but it needed a lot of 
work Œ comfortable on the inside, it needed a lot of work on 
the outside. So, here™s my father and my ol
der sister Hania and my mother and then 
Renia and I. I think that pictur
e was taken later than the three sister s, because we all seem 
to be much older here in 
it. ™36? I don™t know, but anyhow
 it was still in the old house 
and I don™t reme mber exactly when we move
d. I know that we moved right before the 
war. Three years, you know, you don™t re
me mber  exactly which way it went. 
 

Q: Goahead. 

 

A: This is Hania on the left side and I™m on th
e right side, and we were
 reading som
e
thing or 
whatever. It must have been ta
ken already during the war, eith
er right before we went to 
the ghetto or in the ghetto, but this 
is a war picture of the two of us. 
 

Q: Do you think you™re thirteen or
 fourteen, some thing like that? 

 

A: No, I™m older here.  

 

Q: Older?  

 

A: Right, I™m older here. It™s not 1939. It coul
d be 1940, ™41 m
a
ybe, but it™s definitely not 
from before the war.  
 

Q: Okay. 

 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396  
91 
 
A: This is in Buscostruitz (ph). It™s a park
 where my
 mother was going every year, and the 
gate is to that  beautiful park where the f
acilities where she was taking sulfur bags. She 
was suffering fr om rheumatoid arthritis, and she™s in black because this must have been 
the year that her father passed away Œ my gr
andfather. She wa s with him when he died. 

He died in her arms. She took him to Krakow to see a specialist, and they came back to 

the hotel room and he just passed away in he
r arms. He asked her to be brought to the 
window for some fresh air and that was the 
end of Grandpa. So, she never forgot that 
either Œ the loss of her father. And I am with
 her, standing right th
ere. Ever y once in a 
while, I went with my mother or went to vi
sit Grandma. It all de
pended whose turn it was 
to come  along with Mother. She alwa ys took oneof us with her and the other two went to 

Grandma, because my aunts were just wonderful us. They loved when we came  for a  

visit.  
 

Q: Chris, this is what year?  1930?  

 

A: I™m what here?  Six years old, seven year
s old Œ I don™t know. Is it 1930? If it™s 1930, then 
I™m
 six years old here.  
 

Q: Go 
ahead. 
 

A: This is my handsome husband, Miles Lerman
 and myself. This is the wedding picture. 
We, of course, while I w
a s not the bride in wh
ite, I was glad I had a blue dress, which 
was pretty to get ma rried in. It was right 
after the war. It was 
December 1945. We me t. 
We fell in love. We  got ma rried, and thank 
God, we are still together, and I hope for 
ma ny years. Now, we ha ve a wonderful fa mily to be proud of.  
[new picture shown] 

 

Q: Thispicture?  

 

A: We ca me  to Poland on the fact-findingmi ssion, and there was a group from the museum. 
At the tim
e
 it was no mu seum, just a council, and the me mber s of the council were from 
different walks of life, different groups, di
fferent religions. So, M
iles came up with the 
idea that in order for them to
 know what the council is all 
about, it would be worthwhile 
going to Poland, and Eli Weisel was the ch
airman at the time, and Miles took the 
chairmanship of organizing that trip. So, 
we were in Poland visiting the places of 
annihilation and, due to the fact
 that one of the Paliszewski si
sters was still alive and this 
is Maria Paliszewska, we took her with us. We
 we nt to visit her and we brought her with 
us to Wa rsaw. I just wanted to present he
r to the group, for her to meet the Americans 
who came to visit Poland to lear n about the te
rrible story of the Holocaust and to present 

her to the group in her kindness and her gene
rosity and her unde
rstanding that she 
showed her fa mily. So, she went along with 
us everywhere we  went, include Treblinka. 

She insisted that she comes to Treblinka, because
 she, too, felt that she wants to visit the 
place where Mother lost her life. Her mother 
was killed. So, her we are with Miles on the 
left and then Mrs. Paliszewska is in the mi ddl
e, and I™m on the right, and the name  of t he 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0396

community is right on the big ro
ck, it™s like chiseled in the 
rock. It says ﬁStarachowice.ﬂ 
And around you can see sm
all rocks and bi
gger rocks and smaller rocks and each 
represents a community, a destroyed community. 
 
Q: What year was that? 

 

A: That was in 1979, when the council was Œ or 
™80 Œ I think it was. It was right in the 
beginning of the form
ation of the council.
