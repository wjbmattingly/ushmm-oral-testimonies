Question: This is 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial interview with 
Feiga Co nn ors
, 
conducted by 
Judith Cohen
, on November first, in 
Newton, Massachusetts. Feiga
, 
I™m wondering if you can start by giving us 
your name before the war, as your birth 
name, and the date and place of your birth? 
Answer: Ok ay, my  name Œ my  cu Œ my  mo ther gave me Œ I was named after my  
grandmother,
 Feiga
, my fa Œ on my father™s side. 
And th e Po lish name, the school 
registration was 
Fanci
, 
f-a-n-c-i 
or 
c-y.
 And my  last name was 
Hollenberg, h-o-l-l-e-
n-b-e-r-g
. 
Q: And your Œ your date of
 birth and pl
ace of birth? 
A: My date of birth, I™m not totally sure. 
I picked a month that I love, I love May. I 
didn™t Œ I think I was born in March, but I 
really we Œ don™t know. And I think I was 
born Œ I™m Œ I™m registered 
in 1932, when I was in 
DP 
ca Œ ™30 Œ 1933, when  I was in 
DP
 camp, either I was not totally
 understood when  I gave the 
dates, or I was just t Œ it 
was just written down for conven ience, be
cause if you were younger or older, you 
went on this ship or on that
 ship. And I certainly couldn™t 
pick any ships, or wh ere I 
went. Bu t anyways, I don™t think my  birthda
y is that accurate, but I have been Œ 
always gone by May 28
th
, 1933.  
Q: And can you give the names 
of your parents and siblings? 

Interv iew with F eig a

A: Okay. My father™s name is 
Hirsch Hollenberg
, and I think he was born in Œ in 
1898, because I reme mb er him telling us the st
ories th at he was in the first World War 
when  he was 16 or 17, so that puks Œ put
s him approximately that age. My mo m was 
Sally Rosenberg
, and I was told that she was 10 - 11
 or 12 years older Œ younger than 
my father, and I™m not totally sure. So that
 would put her about Œ her birth date about 
1910 or 1912. I know she was 
18 when  she got married in 1930, and a year later, or 
two years later, I was born. 
Q: And you have Œ did 
you have any siblings? 
A: I have tw o younger brothers, I was the ol
dest of three. Actually four. But I had a 
brother that was 15 months younger than I was, and his name was
 Haskell. 
And I had 

my  second younger brother wa
s about four years younger than I was, and his name 
was 
Bunion, b Œ b-u-n-i-o-n
, I think. And Œ and wh en we
 were in the ghetto, my mom 
had a tiny baby, and about January of 1943, or
 February , and he di
ed during one of the 
pogroms. 
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s step back 
before the war. Can you tell 
me what your life was like 
before World War II broke out? 

A: Well, I remember my parents as extrem
ely loving. My  father had a big farm. We 
had lots of land, and we actually were qu
ite well off. My mom fa
mily lived down the 
street from us, the 
Rosenstocks
(ph) and my  grandma had 
a restaurant bar kind of 
thing. And her place, and he
r house was just across from 
the marketplace. So Œ the 

Interv iew with F eig a  
Ho llenberg  Co nno rs 5

marketplace where they 
sold horses and cattle, so I 
remember going there on Thursd ay 
and early, very early Thursd ay morning, 
my  grandma would come Œ she Œ to our 
house. And I reme mb er her brown buns hair in the back . And she would say, okay 
children, it™s time to get dressed. And she 
was just the most loving person. My mo m, 
she was one of six children, I think, maybe 
five. She had a older sister. She had three 
younger brothers. I think sh e 
was one of six, maybe five. 
And Œ and again I rememb er 
one of my  mo ther™s brother, wh en it was my  
first day of school he came by my  house, 
and I had a white bow on my  head, he made Œ wa
nted to make sure th
at I look my best, 
and Œ and I was sent off to school. But it 
was always, you know those me mo ries a-are 
so vivid, and so important to me, that sort of
 Œ but it was sort of secret-like. It k ept me 
alive for so long. 

Q: And what was the Jewish life lik
e? Was Œ how was the Jewish community 
integrated into the genera
l life in the village, a Œ 
A: Well, we Œ w-we Œ in 
Koro lówka
, there were houses a-along streets, the streets 
were unpaved. And the town , the center 
of town was all Jewish, and there were 
synagogues. My fa Œ my family was not ve
ry religious, and neith
er was my mother™s 
family very religious, althou
gh my mo m™s father, my  grandfather wh ich I never knew, 
everybody talked of him being as a 
religious person. M-My Œ my  Œ the 
Hollenbergs
, 
my Œ my father™s two sisters were not too 
religious. So we™d go 
to synagogue and I™d 
go with my father and brother, and my  father
 would take us to synagogue to keep us

out of the house so my mo m would have 
free time. But Œ and Œ and he loved th e 
studying of Judaism, as a studying, as Œ as 
a point of discussion. And I rememb er very 
high falutin™ discussion, and very serious
 because I reme mb er the voices going up and 
down . But in  the sense of devout, on th e sens
e of Œ we were not. But again, i-in the 
morning, he would say his prayers with the tallis and the Œ oh, whatever. And so in one 
sense we were Jewi Œ because we were Jewish
 my father said that it was important for 
all of us to know ar Œ and understand 
who we were. And I remember my younger 
brother would go to  
chayder,
 I didn™t go to
 chayder, 
I had a priv ate tutor at home. 
And my father would talk about the stories 
in the Bible with my  brother and I would 
pipe in and tell the stories before my  brot
her, and Œ and my  father
 would say, now who 
am I talking to here? So, it w Œ it
 was just a very loving family. 
Q: And for holid ays, did you celebrate with 
the extended family, and your cousins, and 

Œ 
A: Ah , y e Œ so metimes . Bu t my  mo m wou l
d start cleaning the house and Œ and 
preparing bread on Friday nigh
t, and bake it in the oven
. And the house was cleaned 
for 
Sha bbat
, thoroughly every week, and on 
Pesach
 it was over-cleaned and painted 
anew an Œ on th e high holiday s again. So  
twice a year the house was re-cleaned.  
Q: And in terms of social life, did your fa
mily socialize mostly 
with relatives, with 
other Jewish families, or w
ith Polish neighbors also? 

Interv iew with F eig a  
Ho llenberg  Co nno rs 7 
November 1, 2009 
  

 
 
A: No, we didn't  social Œ well, we soci
alized because my mo
m had brothers and 
sister s, so we socializ ed
 with them, they would co
me and I remember playing 
[indecipherable]
, all that stuff. And my father woul
d spend an awful lot of time at his 
sister™s house, and my  mo m would say, you™re
 never here. But, because we had a lot of 
land and a big farm, we dealt with the 
Ukraine
 mo re than the Po lish people on a daily 
basis, but it was mo re in terms of labor an
d wo rk being done than  coming to a house 
and having coffee, nobody did that. 
Q: Did you help out on the 
farm also, or it was just Œ 
A: Well, I helped out if
 I didn™t bother anybody. 
Q: Let™s jump ahead to start of World War II 
in 1939. I know th at 
this is an area that 
the Soviets occupied. Can yo
u describe how life changed 
for you when you realized 
that the war was enteri
ng your own little town? 
A: Well, when the Soviets ca
me, the first year went acco
rding usual. But my father 
had to report m-more precisely how many
 Œ how mu ch grain wi
 Œ came in, or how 
much potatoes, that was impor
tant. And by the summer or 
spring of next year, my 
father, I remember him worryi
ng that if we had too much 
land, would they  think us 
being rich, and would we ha
ve to  be shipped away? So  I reme mb er already him 
worrying what will happen if the Soviets w
ould stay Œ would have
 stayed, because the 
imposition and the taxes or the 
contribution of grain to the
 Soviet Union
 was quite 
different than before, and he 
couldn™t hire the Œ as many people as he did befo re.

Q: And as a young child,
 did your life change at all under the Soviets? 
A: No, no, as a matter of fact, it w as quite ni
ce. You know, I Œ I went to school freer; I 
was not as fearful. I don™t know
 what to be fearful, I coul
dn™t tell you sp ecifically, but 
it felt that the police was more on the Jewish
 side. As a matter of fact, one of my 
mo ther™s brutha Œ brothers, 
which h-he is in the photog
raph, he served on th e police 
force as a consultant for awh
ile. So, that never happened 
before. No Jew would ever s-
serve in government or a thing like that be
fore the war. And one of my  cousins Œ well, 
that was maybe before the war, he tested so 
high in school that they were going to send 
him to a high school in 
Borschev
 and that never happened in 
Ko ro ló wka
 before, that 
a Jewish boy would go to a Polish high school. 

Q: Do you have any memo
ry of whether your family was aware of what was 
happening on th e German side of the border? 

A: I didn™t know how Œ there was no newspape
r in our town, or Œ or radio, although 
the radio was just coming in, but it woul
d be through a loudspeaker, so you never 
knew wh at the news were. But what happened, the Jewish community would get 

papers, a month or two months old, from 
Lvov
 or 
Krakow
, or sometimes even from 
the 
United States, 
and that™s how they sort of got
 their news. The best news, if 
anybody got the 
Lo ndo n
 paper, or the other English, 
or other foreign papers, which 
could have been six months old, I don™t 
know, but it was old papers, you know, that 

we got the news. But someho
w, wh en Œ wh en in May or
 June, wh en the schism

Ho llenberg  Co nno rs 9

between 
Russia
 and
 Germany 
came about, everybody knew immediately what was 
happening. And I don™t know how. 
Q: Can you describe those first days when
 the town fell under German occupation in 
June ™41, were there Œ did it take awhile be
fore the front actually
 reached your town, 
or were you immediately aware? 

A: Well, we were immediately aware becaus
e the soldiers walked
 through, the German 
soldiers walked through
 the town. And I was watching th
em walk through, you see, so 
just marching, and ev erybody was happy 
and laughing. Bu t everybody in  town knew 

that something terrible was going to  happen, 
because a few months before, there were 
a lot of people from 
Silesia
 running to  the Ru ssian borders, and wa Œ and that was 
even before the war, before 1
941, and there were some peopl
e that stayed with us in 
our house, because any Œ you 
have to offer hospitality to 
any strangers that c-come 
through the town. And there we
re quite a few different couples that Œ or families that 
stayed in different houses, and I reme
mb er them staying in our house.  
Q: And these are Jewish families Œ 

A: Jewish families Œ 

Q: Œ from 
Silesia
. 
A: Yes, who were running away from the 
Germans. So we knew that something 

terrible was going to  ha Œ is Œ is about to
 happen, but we didn
™t know the extent. 
Q: And did your life change 
immediately that day of Œ

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ when the German soldiers Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: What were the first changes that you experienced? 
A: Well, the first changes, it was in June, and 
we were told, my father was told that he 
cannot hire people to work on the farm. So, my mother we
nt to wo rk on the farm, on 
the Œ on the land with my fath
er. A-And Œ in haying and all that stu ff, he couldn™t hire 
laborers any more. So I re Œ the reason I reme
mber, because I was the oldest, I was left 
in charge of my  two younger brother, and 
I rememb er washing th e floor, and being so 
proud that, you know, at seven,
 eight years, I wa Œ I Œ a-an
 Œ and Œ and I remember my  
mo ther being prou Œ but the po
int is that my moth
er couldn™t do the daily chores and I 
was left to do the daily chores, so it was immediate. 

Q: And, were there any anti-Jewish restri
ctio ns other than the hiring, that were 
imposed that first summer? 

A: Well, I-I Œ as a kid I don™t know what they were. 

Q: Were you allowed to go to school come September? 

A: No, oh no, no. No, school wa
s cut off even before then, 
right. And that was in ™41. 
Q: Now, do you rememb er the attitude of you
r neighbors changing? You talked befo re 
about how th ey were all laughing when  the 
Germans ma rched through. Did they  start 

to react differently to your 
family after the Germans came? 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors

November 1, 2009 
  

 
 
A: No, not really. I don™t rememb er. If they
 did, I don™t remember. Di Œ my family 
didn™t talk to them about 
it. And I don™t rememb er any 
Ukra ine
 family, even the 
people that worked
 for my father 
[indecipherable]
 at least I don™t rememb er my father 
talking. Now that you mention it, I don™t 
know, maybe some of those memories will 
come back, but I don™t reme
mber it as of right now. I don™t remember any 
Ukraine
 
family or Polish family bein
g happy on wh at was happeni
ng. Even as much as they 
hated the Ru ssians, I don™t remember anyon
e coming over and saying that they™re 
happy the Germans are there. The only peop
le that I remember 
being happy is the 
police force. They hired immediately Œ ther
e was a new police force, and they were 
happy, a-and they lo oked Œ went with their 
batons quite co Œ a-around, and ev erybody 
was in their houses when the police went through town. But I don
™t remember any Œ 
any Ukraines bei
ng happy that the Jews were Œ 
Q: So other than the fact that your father 
couldn™t hire Ukrainian laborers, for the first 
war of the occupation, I™m talking before th
e fall of 1942, during th
at first year of Œ 
end of 1941, beginning of ™42, were there 
any other changes in your life, or is it 

basically carrying on as before? 

Q: Well, it was basically sort of the same
. We heard the stories getting mu ch  wo rse, 
and Œ and all of a sudden th
ere was a Jewish Œ a Jewish
 committee set up. And when 
the Germans, or whoever it was needed th
ings, they went to the committee and the 
committee obliged them. So I re
member putting Œ asking people 
to give money at first. 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors

That was right after the high holidays of th at
 year. I don™t know when it was, whether 
it was before the first p ogrom in 
Ko ro ló wka
, or when, but my father™s older sister had 
three boys. And I told you one 
of the boys was this genius 
type who was going to go to 
high school for the first year. And I think 
it was sometimes before the first pogrom that 
they asked for young boys as laborers, a
nd they would go to the committee and the 
committee would provide. And I 
think two of my cousins we
re taken as laborers and I 
think that they were
 sent either to 
Lvov
 or to 
Belzec
, or Œ I don™t know.  
Q: Did you have to wear 
any iden tifying badge, or Œ  
A: Yeah. I don™t remember when it was put 
on, whether when Œ after the first p ogrom, 
I think, when we went to 
the ghetto, we had to Œ or maybe Œ maybe before. I™m not 
totally sure when  we Œ we Œ we didn™t wear
 yellow stars, we wore
 white stars, white 
armb ands, and the white armb and supposed  to
 be pressed and very
 designating. And if 
it wasn™t, you were taken off to labor camp,
 and so  people had plastic, white plastic 
things with elastic, and then 
the Jewish star, so the Œ th e Œ the band was very neat and 
clear. And that I remember. And I always want
ed to know where th
ey got those plastic 
bands, and I didn 't dare ask anybody, a
nd I still think about it, yeah, 70 years later. 
Q: So th e first pogrom, that was fall of 1942? 
A: Yeah, that was the first pogrom of 1942, 
it was during the Jewish holid ay, or just as 
the Jewish hol Œ or the first day of th
e Jew Œ it was somet imes in September, or 
whenever the Jewish holid
ay was at that year.

Q: So describe the Œ your me
mory of what happened. It 
was the Jewi sh holiday, you 
were getting ready fo r the holid ay, and I mean, wha-wh at happened ? 
A: Well, let me tell you befo re. Before, my  
father™s family s Œ 
I told you we knew 
what was happening and my  cousins were sent
 off to labor camp. And so  Œ so that was 
before my cousins, I think, were sent to 
labor camp. I™m not sure exactly, but my mo Œ 
my father™s two sisters, their families, th
ey had three boys, one had two, one was a 
hardware store manager, he ha
d his own little hardware and 
another family on his side 
dug a bunker in my aunt™s Œ my aunt™s ba
ckyard. And there was a little outhouse, and 
under the outhouse we dug Œ th
ey dug the Œ the bunker that
 could hold 20 people, or 
thereabouts. So, that summer, be
fore the first pogrom, or th
at actually was even before 
the summer, because the earth
 was soft, so we already knew what was happening. I 
didn™t know, but them digging a bunker for 
no particular reason how to  camouflage, so 
my  father and family knew wh at was going to  happen. 
Q: And describe this bunker a little bit, besi
des being very big. We
re there provisions, 
any fo od stocked, or 
was it just a big hole? 
A: N-No . It was a big hole under. You™d go 
th rough th e outhouse, in the outhouse 
you™d leave the door open, 
so nobody would go in to th
e outhouse. But underneath 
you™d lift it up like going down  a cellar and 
you™d go into  the bunker. But here, this Œ 
those marvelous people who dug th e dunk Œ bu
nker, didn™t dig a Œ for air to come in. 
They thought the air would come  in through the wood cracks in the entrance. So when 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
14 
November 1, 2009 
  

 
 
we got into the bunker, ther
e was no air. Bu t that Œ I™ll tell you th at Œ wh at happened  a 
little bit later. 
Q: Okay, let™s move int Œ describe the even
ts before you went in to the bunker. What 
tipped you off that there was an emergency? 

A: Okay, so there was the ha Œ all that 
summer, everybody was 
apprehensive and on 
the lookout. So, if anything ha
ppened, our house was, here 
is the to wn, our semicircle 
of a town Œ is it okay? 
Q: Yeah, it™s just a little Œ 
but the Œ just switch the volume
 a bit, cause it™s Œ okay. I 
don™t know, there™s so me sort
 of noise, but I don™t know wh
at™s causing it, but we™ll Œ 
A: Let me take this pen, and I™ll draw you 
a picture. Here are tw
o roads into the town, 
and here are the houses, right he
re. And my  house is right here. 
Q: Okay, see if this is better. Okay. 
A: Okay . And my  house is right here
. And this road goes all the way to
 Borschev.
 So  
if you look out from my house, you can so
 Œ see the hill. So
, it was a Saturday 
morning. My father saw trucks coming right 
over there, so there 
was a little space in 
here. And he calls me, he sees the truc
ks, and he s Œ calls
 me and he says, 
Fanci
, go 
around and tell that the Germans are coming. 
We™ll see you th ere in a bit, in a little 
while. Run. And I went, and th
ey ran into 
the bunker.  
Q: So th e whole extended family was together? 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
15 
November 1, 2009 
  

 
 
A: Prepared  to Œ whoever was there. I don™t 
know if my  aunt and her husband, because 
their houses were a little bit away, but my younger Œ my Œ my fath
er™s younger sister, 
her children. The bunker was full. And my 
extended family, they
 had a baby, about a 
18 months old baby. And wasn™t
 a baby, but it was a baby in terms of the comfort level 
of being in the bunker. Anyway s, we ar
e in the bunker for about an hour, and 
everybody™s squishing back 
and not saying a word , and 
if somebody said, everybody 
would say sshh. And the baby starts crying,
 and wouldn™t stop. And th e Germans came 
into the backyard and 
they didn™t have to 
lo ok for anything, they  heard the baby cry. 
So it Œ they found all of us in the bunker. So
, when I went to my 
aunt™s, my father and 
mother were not there with me, they didn
™t catch up with me, they hid someplace e-
else, I Œ I assumed, after it was over. So, the Germans came and took ev erybody to  the 
big common. There was a common right here, green grass, a common right here and 

they put everybody 
in this common. 
Q: Including you. 

A: Including me. And at one po
int when we taking out of 
the bunker, m-my uncle tried 
to run away and the German pulled him b
ack and almo st bra Œ broke his shoulder. 
Anyway s, we all went there to the big common. 
Q: And did they catch your parents also? 
A: No, I™ll tell you ab out Œ my  Œ both my  pa
rents, my  father went in a different 
direction, he went, and my mother ran into 
a hiding place of a neig
hbor up in  the thing.

And he-h er house was right here in front of
 this common with all 
the people. So when  
the trucks came to take everybody, that wa
s about 10:30, 11 o™clock, because I Œ you 
know, you Œ ye Œ you knew Œ 
so, it was some times 
in the morning. 
So, everybody was 
screaming, and everybody, you
 know, they were families, hold my hand, don™t run 
away, stay with me. And no
body said to me, hold my  ha
nd. There was no mo th er or 
father that was holding onto
 me. So, instead, I wasn™t goi
ng to go in  that truck and 
every Œ and there was so much confusion a
nd screaming and crying, that I ran away, I 
ran this way, behind the mo nument. And there was a pharmacy here, and I ran behind 
the pharmacy, and once I was out of sight, 
I ran into the fields, and I escaped. 
Q: How old were you, about, at this time? 
A: About nine, maybe. Eight or nine. It was 
in 1943, let™s say even 10, but probably  
nine. 
Q: Did you ever find out wh at happened  to

Q: Hello, we™re back. This is the 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum with
 
Feiga Co nn ors, 
conducted by
 Judith Cohen
, on November first, in 
Newton, 
Massachusetts. 
Okay, 
Feiga, 
bef Œ would Œ 
A: Ah, can I say something about this Œ 
Q: Sure. 

A: Œ second introduc
tion. My  name is 
Feiga Connors
, but if you put in that
 
Hollenberg
 in the middle, it™s just very important. 
Q: Okay , we™ll Œ we start aga Œ
 Feiga Ho llenberg Conn ors. 
A: Thank you. 
Q: And Œ pleasure Œ and before
 the tape ran out, we were 
just talking about how you 
managed to escape from the first 
aktion
 and you were separate
d from your aunt and 
uncle, and you went around the back and es
caped and came home. So tell me what was 
Œ mood was like when you got home and your 
parents found you. That mu st have been 
incredible. 
A: Well, it was Œ it was Œ first of all, ev
erybody said, who™s here? We didn™t ask how 
we survived, but I remember my
 brothers holding my  hands, 
so I didn™t even get to my 
parents and my  brothers were just four and se
ven, or something, or three. I mean, they 

didn™t know what was happ Œ 
I mean, they were kids, so 
Œ but the intensity of losing 
everything, and also wh at happened. The 
town was empty. Almo st everybody was

taken away. I use that euphemism, taken aw
ay, and I use the euph
emism, I-I lost my 
family in the war, because in
 my heart, noth Œ every Œ that picture of my town and 
home is static. So Œ and that also gives meexcuse, I don™t have to
 talk about anything, 
if things are the same. But the whole end is 
what I remember as a Œ before I ran away. 
It™s not that I felt alone with
ou Œ without my parents, but I felt the urgency of getting 
to my parents, or getting away. And I rememb
er standing on the h
ill, where the trucks 
passed me by, and feeling such  a Œ va Œ I got
 you. You didn™t get me. And I felt such a 
Œ a Œ a defiance. Do you know, I re Œ I have 
never felt that defiance like I did at that 
moment. So, what happened after that first ac Œ as you call it 
aktion
 or pogrom or 
killing Œ well, it wasn 't a killing, because th
ey were not Œ there were only one or two 
people or 10 people dead, bu
t it was a town of Œ of about 15 to 2500 people, and there 
was nobody left, just a few people left, lite
rally. So what they did after that, they send 
us into the next to
wn, into a ghetto. 
Q: And describe the ghetto for me. 

A: Ah, first, I don™t remember getting to th
e ghetto. I don™t know where I was, or I 
don™t remember the trip. It™s about a 10 
minutes, 15 minutes Œ well, by car, but we 
didn™t have a car. I don™t rememb er how we got to
 Borschev
 or ho-how the few people 
got to 
Borschev
. But what I remember is w e getting into 
Borschev
 and there is a room 
waiting for us, so it means that
 my  father or somebody went ahead and Œ and there was 

a place for us to stay. 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors

Q: And in
 Borschev
, did Œ were you able to go to  sc
hool, or was there forced labor? 
How did you spend your day in the ghetto? 
A: Okay. It was Œ in
 Borschev
 we got there right after the holiday , the end of 
September, October, so it wasn™t cold yet. 
There was no school. There was no labor. 
We Œ my  father mu st have Œ 
ho-how they found pe
ople to hide things, and Œ and oh, I 
reme mb er t o o ,  wh en  
we closed up our house, when  we left
 Koroló wka
, my  mo m 
giving th ings to people, and putting th em in
 with Ukraines and 
Polish people for 
hiding, so we can use that eith
er money, or linen or dishes 
or silver, all sorts of things, 
using that during the war as
 to get food. How they did 
it and what, I don™t remember. 
And so I rememb er sa Œ us getting Œ finding 
[indecipherable]
 and there were five 
people; us, and my father™s sister was with us
 at that time, she is 
the one that survived, 
too. And then a month later, how we lived. 
I was the one that, because I didn™t look 
Jewish, I was the one that went to the ma
rket to bring home food. I was the only one 
that could leave the Œ th
e ghetto to get food. 
Q: And how did you do 
it? Was there ration coupons, or you are bartering with the 
belongings? 

A: No, somehow I had money, an d I would go 
to the market and give money a-a Œ and 
for 
[indecipherable]
 and pick out what I wanted, an
d give the mo ney and walk  away, 
and, you know, just like what everybody do
es. So I did the market thing on a regular 
basis. I don™t know what my  two younger brot
hers did with their tim
e, o r  me  with  my

time. It was Œ we were very 
good, nobody ever 
complained. I don™t 
remember Œ I used 
to fight with  my  brothers, I don™t reme mb er 
one fight in the ghetto. Not that they  were 
angels, but I don™t even remember them. 
Q: And Œ  
A: And Œ and I told you that there was a 
baby that was born in  the ghetto. I don™t 

reme mb er ev en  my  mo th er p r eg
nant. I wasn™t aware. She mu
st have gotten pregnant at 
home and gotten to the ghetto, because we le
ft in October, and the baby was born in 
February. So , she mu st have been  pregnant
, and I don™t rememb er any su ch a thing. 

All I remember is that we were all in
 the same room, me  and my  brother and 
everybody, when  my  mo ther had her baby, 
in the same ro om. There was a midwife. 
So, again, how th ey procured  the midwif
e, how th ey got the mid Œ I don™t know. 
Q: And, was a baby boy? 

A: And was a baby boy. And what I rememb er
 about the baby boy, we were all happy, 
I remember that. And I remember we all sa
ying, well, we don™t have to worry about 
naming him, we have so many names to c
hoose, because you name 
your baby after Œ 
well, after dead people. So my
 ba Œ so, in order to honor the people, we wer Œ so, we 
named my  baby brother with certain 
names, know? And we Œ there was a 
bris
.
 
I 
reme mb er s o meb ody  co min g  th ere, to  th at
 room. But I don™t remember. I remember 
my mother being fearful of the 
bris
. 
Q: And who were some of the peop
le that he was named after?  

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
22 
November 1, 2009 
  

 
 
A: He was named 
Mendel
. He was named Œ I forgot the other names, but I rememb er 
seven names 
[indecipherable]
 out, to honor the people, th
at they were Œ they were 
cousins, brothers. Some we didn
™t totally know that were de
ad, but we Œ my father told 
me, you know, wrote it down very clearly. 
Q: And when you were in the ghetto, was your
 father forced to do any forced labor? 

Was he taken out, or he Œ 
you Œ stayed home with you? 
A: I don™t Œ he Œ we all stayed in the ro
om all the time, b u t I don™t remember seeing 
him. So, I don™t remember what it is that 
anybody did, you know, 
as an occupation. I 
have no id ea. And I know th ere was no sch
ool, there was no Œ befo re we had private 
tutoring, and all that stuff. 
If somebody didn™t go to this 
school, they Œ they had all 
sorts of things, so schooling was an impor
tant thing. But I don™t remember. And the 
other thing, just to summarize, we were in th
at ghetto, not for very 
long. So we were in 
the ghetto from October Œ September, Octobe
r, til the summertime, June, July. So it 
was about eight or nine months. So , wh at ha
ppened  in the ghetto, that every month or 
two, there was 
[knocking]
 Œ somebody at the door. 
Q: Okay, let™s pause for one second.

A:

Q: 
Koro lówka
 to the ghetto, and you had talked ab
out the birth of your baby brother. 
And you had discussed a little b
it about what life was lik e in
 the ghetto during the first 
months. And as I understand it, around 
Purim,
 things changed. Why don™t we pick up 
the interview over there? 
A: Okay. After my brother was born, he

It™s a continuation of the

, 2010. Okay
, Feiga
, 
when we were last talk ing, we had Œ y
ou had mentioned how you
r family was forced 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors

into the ghetto, and you talked
 about the birth of your ba
by brother, and wh at life was 
like in the ghetto during th at first month or 
two. Let™s pick up the interview at this 
point, and can you describe Œ 
I understand that things changed a lot as of March of 
1943. 
A: Right. So, we moved 
Ko ro ló wka
, we came 
Judenfrei
 after the major clean ing out 
of 
Ko ro lówka  
and taking everybody away
, and the people that were left were sent to 
the bigger ghetto in  
Borschev.
 And we first lived in one 
building, then we moved to 
another building. And my  mo m had a baby, 
I think th e baby was stillborn in the o-

other building before we moved to this bu
ilding number two. And,
 he was a little boy. 
And he Œ and I remember him 
being born, and the midwife in the room, and all of us, 
my  mo m, my  dad, my  two younger brothers 
and my aunt were all in the room while 
my  mo m gave birth to the baby. And Œ and th ere was a 
bris
, there was Œ the next day, 
or a few days later. So the ghetto had all th
e Jewish, the rabbis, everybody was there. 
Q: Can you describe the mood when he wa
s born? Was it feeling celebratory, that 
there was a new child, or was it fear? 

A: No, it wa Œ first of all, it was fear, not
 just for the baby™s 
survival, but for the 
adults™ survival, what would happen with a p
ogrom, with the killings, that we have to 
go in to hiding. So we already 
knew  that he might not sur 
Œ I mean, we knew that we 
were all in major danger, so I think, now th
at you mention it, that
 was probably one of 
the reason that we mo ved from building numb
er one to building numb er two, because 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
25 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
there was a little bit more liberty, or people 
didn™t say we won™t allow the baby in the 
Œ in the bunker. Because every building had 
a bunker, and in  building numb er one, the 
bunker was between the two houses, so it 
was a wall was walled off, and we™d crawl 
into a s Œ into a small place to get into th 
Œ this wall. And in building number two, the 
one that we moved, the bunker
 was in the cellar. So when
 the killing began, everybody 
went into  the Œ to th e build ing, that was during th e 
Purim
 massacre, and Œ and they 
didn™t allow the baby to come 
in with us. He was, by then, 
four or five weeks old, he 
was still tiny. And you know Œ 
and I know he was tiny in Œ 
in the recollection of what 
he did, he was just lying th
ere, he cou Œ you know, he c
ouldn™t even  smile yet. So he 
was very tiny. And so we all went into Œ in to
 the bunker in the ce
llar, and we couldn™t 
bring the baby, so we left the baby on a 
big bed, surrounded w
ith pillows. And my 
mo m was crying and they ke
pt holding her down . And we
 stayed there, I don™t 
remember how long, but we 
stayed there til it 
was almost dark, you know, from the 
morning. And when we got upstairs we f
ound the baby dead. Bu
t not just this, the 
baby™s cries were so loud, that the baby 
jeopardized the people 
next door, who were 
hiding in that compartment in between th
e walls, between one wall and another. So 
here were the people, here 
were the two Œ you know, and the cry from this bed Œ from 
this room to the Œ the police, it Œ this 
was not Œ this massacre wasn™t a German 

massacre, it was the 
Ukraine 
police and the German and th
e Poles that did it. So it 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
26 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
wasn™t primarily the German Gest
apo like when  they  cleaned out 
Koroló wka, 
like in 
the first pogrom. So  this was a kind of 
cobr Œ co-cooperati
on with everybody. 
Q: And the people wh o conduc
ted this, were they, the Ukra
inians and the Poles, were 
they known to the Jewish co
mmunity from before, or were 
they brought in from the 
outside? 
A: We didn™t know anybo
dy, and I don™t recollect a
nybody knowing of retur Œ you 
know, being friendly. I knew one 
of my  cousins 
w o rk ed  fo r th e 
Ukraine
 police, and 
one time I went to the market and the police 
caught me, and my  cousin came and sort 
of rescued me in the poli Œ the 
Ukra ine
 police let me go because of my  cousin. 
Q: This was during the war, or before? 
A: That Œ everything was Œ that was in
 Borschev
 in the ghetto, a Œ a few weeks after Œ 
after the Œ the massacre. But Œ 
so, to finish the story with that Œ with that massacre o-
on y Œ on 
Purim
, after it was over, we went upstairs
 and we saw the baby dead . And 
the next day, or maybe it was even the same
 day, there was a cart with a horse, and 
would drive by each building a
nd people would put their d
ead on this cart. And my 
mo ther was so upset and crying that I took 
the baby, she gave me the baby, or I took 
the baby Œ anyways, 
I took the baby out and put the ba
by wrapped up in  a blanket, on 
the cart. So I don™t even know 
where the baby was buried.  
Q: And were these Jews who 
were doing th e burial, or Œ 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
27 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
A: Yeah, oh yeah. Nobody in 
those situation would 
Œ none of the Ukraines or the Poles 
were just too good, nobody would do any cl
eaning, ev erything had to be done by Jews. 
And then  during Passover a month later, 
there was the big ma ssacre, where they 
rounded up hundreds 
of people and they 
shot them in the 
Borschev
 massa cre. And 
they lined them up an
d they shot all the people. I Œ 
I mig h t be confusing a little bit 
because of such a long time,
 whether it was just at the 
Purim
 massacre, or the Œ or the 
Œ or Œ or the one just before Passover, wh
ere they lined up hu
ndred s, everybody in 
Borschev
 and th ey shot them in the big grav e. 
And again, this wasn™t just a German Œ 
a German there with 
the Œ the Œ the Œ the 
Ukraine
 police with their 
shooting. And that 
grave, it™s still there, b u t what I recollect
, maybe that™s a child
hood memory, was that 
the grave itself was very long. It was about Œ 
longer than this house, which is this Œ I 
don™t know how long. Well, anyways, it was 
almo st a half a block long. And wh en I 
went to market pe Œ the Œ the peasants 
were talking about the grave, how it was 
bubbling and th e Œ and the blood was just goi
ng up and down, bluh
, bluh, bluh. So I 
went to the grave, and wanted
 to see it, to the Jewish ce
metery and wanted to see the 
grave itself. And sure enough, it wasn™t as st
rong as the first day, but still, you can see 
the heave of the grave,
 kind of, just the moving of the 
grave. And Œ and I let it be, and 
there Œ one of the 
Sturmers
(ph) Œ the people, the wife of Mr. 
Sturmer
(ph), her name 
was 
Chana
(ph), she said to me, she says, I just 
want you to rememb er that I saw you 
in a blue coat, walking around, an d I sa
w where you were coming from, which means 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
28 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
the direction of the cemetery
. So, do you know, I always t
hought that that was just a 
memory kind of thing that 
I remembered kind of, and wouldn™t say it til anybody til 50 
- 60 years later, 
Chana
(ph)
 Sturmer
(ph) affirmed my memory
. So, I don™t mean I was 
happy, but it was like the memories were rea
lly memo ries, because I didn™t talk mu ch 
about the Holocaust or anyt
hing like that, it was just like it was unshared. It was 
something th at I knew, and it was mine. A
nd to have somebody say, I saw from where 

Œ you know, in this blue coat, and all of a 
sudden, I rememb er the blue coat, and it was 
unbelievable. But after that big massacre, th
ere were not that many Jews left in the 

Borschev 
ghetto. 
Q: Let me just stop and ask you two ques
tions. So, with the big ghetto Œ the big 
massacre, rather, on Passover, where Œ 

A: Or thereabouts, I™m not Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ totally sure. 
Q: I™d like t Œ explain, where were you an
d your family? How did 
you and your family 
survive that massacre? And al
so, could you say, wh en you went to the market 
afterwards, and you heard th
e peasants talking, can you describe the mood of the 
peasants? Were they just talk
ing about this with 
happiness, wer Œ with curiosity, with 
sadness? 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
29 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
A: No, they were Œ they were
 just talking like it was an 
[indecipherable]
 for them. It 
was an unbelievable situation. None of th
em were happy, you know, was a happy Œ it 
was a mark et where people come on Thursday
 to do their busine
ss, you know. So, it 
wasn™t Œ I don™t know if it was T hursd ay; in
 Koro lówka 
market day was a Thursday, 
in 
Borschev
 I don™t remember ex actly. But anyways,
 it was Œ it was Œ people just were 
talking in  wonderment, and si Œ and really tr
ying to look to scripture for affirmation 
that those things will happen, and therefore 
they are happening. I mean, that™s what I 
heard. That™s why the complete amazement 
of wh at happened , and how it was actually 
the Œ most of the peasants were really sc
ared that such a thi
ng could affect them 
forever, you know, in terms of 
the crops and Œ and the growth  in the fields, and things 
like that. So there was also a certain amount
 of wo nderment and fear, and it was like, 
did you see this? Tremendous wonderment. 
And Œ and one of th
e reasons that, all 
those years later, 68 years, I want, before my 
time is up, I really wanted the kids to see 
that grave. And it was nothing what I saw, 
and wh at I rememb er a-and felt, and never 
talked about.  

Q: So how did your family
 survive the big massacre ?  
A: The big ma Œ I don™t Œ we were hiding. It
 was still in the same
 old cellar, in same 
house, but after that was over, there was ru
mors of sending the Jews to another place 
after this massacre, and we kn
ew what other places they we
re. So Œ so here you have 
Passover in the spring, and by 
May and June, we were looking fo r a place. My father 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
30 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
went back  to 
Ko ro ló wka
 to see if we could hide, if 
we could find somebody to hide 
us. And then  in May, the end of May or
 th e beginning of June of 1943, we left
 
Borschev
 as a family, and went into hiding in 
Koroló wka
. 
Q: Can you describe how you were
 able to escape 
from the ghetto? 
A: The ghetto was not closed in, it was not 
Œ it was an open ghe
tto. The Œ the thing, 
the Jews lived in the ghetto b
ecause there was no other place to
 live. So di Œ you didn™t 
need a gate or anything to close it in. Ther
e was an ordinance that
 nobody was allowed 
in or out of the ghetto except Jews. So, bei
ng non-Jewish looking and 10 years old, I 
was the one that would go in and out of th
e ghetto with no comp
lication except once. 
So I did the marketing for, you know, people
 would give me what
ever, and I would do 
the marketing for our family 
and for people around us. So that™s how I-I Œ I left. There 
was no Œ no gate or electric stuff or anything like that. 
Q: So aft Œ 
A: A-And nobody would Œ no Jew would 
dare live outside the prescribed area 
anyways, because that mean
t Œ so no matter how much you complied, it didn™t make 

any difference, you died sooner or later. 

Q: So, did you leave in the middle 
of the night, or in the day? 
A: No, no, we left about 10
 o™clock in the daytime so 
we™d have enough Œ because 
Borschev
 walking is a long ways, and so we want
ed to make sure th
at we had enough 
light wh en we Œ we didn™t get to
 Koro lówka, 
we got to some peasants house, and 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
31 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
from there they hid in
 the forest. And Œ and so w-we were six people, my fam Œ my 
mother, father, my two brothers and myself
 and my  aunt, who surviv ed from the big Œ 
from the
 Koroló wka
 killings. And we went into the fo
rest, and there were two or three 
other peop Œ families that we
 met up for it. We didn™t kn
ow, but we met up with it. 
And by, I think August, the Œ the 
Ukraine
 police found out, and they were just two or 
three police, and they  came into the forest
 and start shooting i
ndiscriminately. And 
somehow my  father and I and my  brother es
caped, and my  aunt was shot in the heart 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Oh. Let™s move back just 
a little bit. When you were in 
the get Œ in the forest, how 
did you surv ive, wh ere did you find
 food, where were you sleeping? 
A: Well, by then we were sleeping in the 
open air, you know, in the forest. And it was 
summer, so there was no Œ and Œ and there was 
a stream in the forest, so we had water 
from the stream. My father 
went and got food for us. An
d then Œ I can™t remember 
now exactly whether my
 mo ther and my  younger brother 
left us, an d I can™t remember 
Œ she Œ she felt she would find a safer place. 
That if we divide, we
 would have a better 
chance of su rviv al, and finding a place. So my  father took me and my  brother, and my  

mo ther went with my  younger brother,
 Bunio n
. And my  father and I and my  brother
 
Haskell
 sur Œ went with my father. We stayed
 in forest a little longer after my aunt 
was shot. Actually, ma ybe two days longer. My
 mother left. But I™m 
not totally sure if 
she left before my aunt was kille
d, or after my aunt was killed.

Q: Do you have memo ries of what it wa
s like the day your 
mother and younger 
brother, when you decided to brea
k up as a family and she left? 
A: I Œ I don™t rememb er y Œ feeling of re
flection or sadness. I don™t rememb er when 
my  brother died, wh en the tiny baby died, or
 anything saying what a terrible thing just 
happened to us. I remember th
at I was glad that whoever wa
s with me was with me. It 
was not in terms of the loss that I remember
 feeling sad, it was that I was there with 
somebody. And if we wait it out
, you know, just like they 
did, out the massacres, or 
like in 
Koro lówka,
 where the first massacre occurred 
and th ey put everybody on th e Œ 
on th e trucks, and ev ery Œ and then the tr
ucks came  and everybody cried, hold my  
hand, hold my  hand. And because my  parent
s were not with me, nobody said to me, 
hold my  hand, so I ran away. An d that sens
e that I had some control and could run 
away, whether I went marketing, or whether 
I Œ I went to the grave to look at the 
feeling, the sense that I could do somethin
g for me, and for whoever was next to my 
body, you know. And I wanted
 everybody to be next to my  body. And wh en th ey 
weren™t there, the first part was the emptin
ess, the feeling of all empty, alone. You 
know, it™s just like when you go camping, an
d then nobody Œ you kn
ow, the other kids 
go into the water, and you™re 
still on the shore. It was a ki
nd of unreal feeling, and it 
was a kind of feeling that, if I don™t feel th  Œ a true feeling about it, everything will 
come back. It will just go b
ack to  where it was. I don™t know if I make sense, I™m 
sorry.

Q: No, it does. So, your moth
er and younger brother left, and Œ ab out the same  time 
that your aunt was shot. Did you actually s
ee the Ukrainians who ca
me into the forest, 
or were they shoo
ting from a distance? 
A: No. No, no. What I rememb
er, is my father put my he
ad down  and my  brother, and 
we crawled on our be-belly out 
from the area were, and we we
nt out of the forest into 
the field. There was a cornfield or some ki
nd of field, and we we
re there. And when 
we se Œ heard, when  the shots were fired, and stopped firing, we stayed there fo r a 
little while longer, but we 
knew that they left. An
d when we were back Œ 
[phone 
ringing, tape break] 
Q: So, how much longer than Œ af
terwards did you and your sa Œ 
A: Is it working? 
Q: Yes Œ did you and your father 
and brother remain
 in the forest? 
A: Til it got dark. I™m not totally su re, but I 
know that we were in a village where we 
had land. I think I told you we
 were farmers and we
 had lots of land. So, ar Œ we Œ we 
always used the farmers, the peasants and 
the farmers to work fo
r us. So my father 
knew almost everybody in 
the village Œ in the Œ in
 Ko ro ló wka  
and su rrounding 
Koro lówka
. So, the Œ we left the forest, and that
 was still hot, so it might have been 
July. 
Q: Did th ese people that you knew  from befo
re the war help you in terms of getting 
food once you were in the forest? 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors

October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
A: Not in the Œ yeah, 
well, my father went and got some
 food, so he must have gone 
there. But when we left Œ we paid everybo
dy, by the way, nobody gave us, gave us, 
but we paid, either in goods, we had some 
goods in Œ in Œ with 
one farmer who gave 
us, you know, like Œ like pots and pans or 
bedding, or wh atever, or whatever there 
was, we had some goods with one person. 
And my  father went and got some of the 
goods to give it to anot Œ to give it to wh
oever gave us food and let us sleep over. So 
we always paid, but the payment was nothing 
in comparison to be 
allowed to stay out 
of the rain, or out of the Œ oh, specially in
 October of ™43 to ™44, when it was cold, 
when we found a woman who kept
 us i-i Œ f-f Œ til February 28
th
. 
Q: Is that someone you had 
known from before the war? 
A: Well, my father probably knew. She wa
s an old wo man, and I don™t know how he 
found her, but h-he Œ we paid
 her to stay thro
ugh the months, and we paid her quite 
well.  
Q: And where did she hide you? 
A: Sh Œ we hid in th e Œ in the barn. She 
had the Œ the Œ the hay, you know, for the 
winter, and all the f-fo od that you accumulat
e through Œ you know, the way a farmer 
accumulates th-the wheats and the cornhusks a
nd all that. And we stayed hidden under 
the Œ under the Œ the Œ th
e wheat, you know, the Œ 

Q: And did she bring y
ou fo od, or did you Œ 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
35 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
A: She brought us food ev
ery night and it was potato an
d water. Three and a half 
potatoes and water every night, sometimes four potatoes. 
Q: And did she stay to talk to you,
 to tell you what was going on, or Œ 
A: No. 

Q: She just dropped the food and left? 

A: And left. And Œ and she had to do it, she 
had neighbors on each side, so she had to 
do it dis Œ very discreetly.  
Q: So this time did you think that anybody el
se knew that you were there, or she was Œ 
A: No, I don™t even know the woman™s na
me. There was one time Œ and we stayed 
from Œ from October, on Œ or 
November til February 28
th
 of 1944. So we stayed there 
for a long time. 
Q: And how did you pass the 
time while you were hidden? 

A: We just sat there. And me and my  br
other would so metimes whisper. We couldn™t 
talk, whisper, h-how Œ what we would do wi
th  food, an d how happy we would be, and 
of the memories, how th ings will be as soon as this was over.  
Q: Did your father whisper also, or Œ 

A: Yeah, my father was betw
een me and my  brother. And one time toward th e end, I Œ 
I got very peculiar 
[indecipherable]
 with the end. I don™t know why, it was night and I 
screamed and I said I didn™t care if I died, 
and I hope we all die today, and it was just 
not worth. And I felt so sorry afterwards.

Q: And Œ 
A: But my  brother, who was tw
o years younger than me, he was just so brave, he 
never, never comp lained. I Œ I one time lost 
my temper with ever
ybody, and my father 
felt so helpless, he didn™t know what to do.
 So my brother tried to talk to me. My 
father felt that if nobody said anything 
I would calm down, wh ich, that was what 
happened .  

Q: And were you able to move arou
nd at all and stretch your legs Œ 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: So you were lying flat? 

A: Lying and sitting. As a matter of fact, we
 had to sit close by b
ecause you don™t want 
to make a big space under the Œ under the wh
eat, you know, uh, what is it called? The 
brush, whatever. And you don™t want to ma
ke a big space, because if anybody comes 
in, it has to look lik
e nobody is there.  
Q: And were there times when ot
her people walked into  the barn? 

A: Well, toward the end, I think, in Œ either
 the end of January  or th e beginning of the 
February, we her Œ we heard somebody comi
ng in, but we didn™t know who it was, 
and they left. And so , what
 happened, on February 28
th
 is, there was a snowstorm. It 
started early on, and the woma
n who kept us, asked us to 
leave. And when  we got up 
to walk, stand up, it was hard, 
but what happened to me is 
I became very bloated. My 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
37 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
feet were just so bloated. But anyways, we 
put on Œ and the clothes that I ha Œ because 
I was so bloated, just didn™t fit. 
But anyways, w-we did leave, and Œ 
Q: Did she say why she wa
nted you to  leave, wh
y she changed her mind? 
A: There™s no question ah Œ sh
e says, you have to leave. 
And we didn™t question too 
mu ch, or I didn™t hear any discussion, let™
s put it that way. Maybe my father talked, 
but th-there was no time that anybody sat do
wn and talked with 
her, because then the 
neighbors would know wh at™s going on. So he
re we were in the hiding place, and she 
delivered th -the food at night and she said
, you have to  leave tomo rrow. And so there 
was no discussion, can you keep 
us a day longer, or anything, cause the Œ we didn™t, at 
the same time, we didn't want to give the pl
ace away, we didn't want to give ourselves 
away i-if anybody hear
d. So, we Œ we had to leave, so
 it was very obedient and very 
quiet, with no Œ no discussion. She said we 
had to leave, I don™t remember my father 
even saying anything else. So we left, and in
 Œ and the s Œ and the snow was very high. 
You know, in my  part of the wo rld the snow
 gets Œ and the cold
 gets cold, and the 
snow gets very high. And so , for me to pick 
my  feet up and down , I just couldn™t do it, 
so we got to one place, and I just couldn't Œ 
and my  father said that, if you ju st walk 
just a little while longer to this place, I™ll se
e if you can stay there, so your body will 
calm down. So we got to this 
one family Œ actually, there 
were two families, th ere was 
wa Œ one man and his wife lived in one si
de of the house and one woman, the other 
one, lived  in the other side. And so we got 
there at night and Œ and my  fa Œ and my  

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
38 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
father begged the man to keep me. I think th
at was a kine Œ either Friday night or 
Saturday  night Œ to keep  me 
overnight and he™ll come back for me the next day, and he 
promised him he would. A
nd they knew each other, becaus
e you know, people worked 
for us. So I was left there, and then the 
next day was either Saturday  or Su nday, 
anyways, it was February 28
th
. Peasants come to that ho
use. They  mu st have known 
we were there because the footprints were
 all over, because of the big snow. And I 
heard people saying that my father and my br
other were killed, and 
put in the Œ in the 
grotto. And the Œ the grotto
 has this big hole, this Œ the grotto where the 
[indecipherable]
 were hiding, and they put them 
there. And they said that the 
woman™s son-in -law, the wo man that was hi
ding us for three months, her son-in-law 
killed us Œ killed my fa
ther and my brother. 
Q: Do you know anything abou
t who th e son-in -law was? 
A: Well, he was the woman™s son-in-law, so
 she had a daughter who had a husband, 
and the person that came in, I was telling 
you there was only one person we heard 
coming into  the barn , mu st have been the so
n-in-law sort of teasing us. And he mu st 
have demanded from the wo man to 
thro w us out. And his name was 
Mucha, m-u-c-h-
a, 
which in 
Ukraine
 means fly. And I don™t know if it was his last name or it was his 
nickname, but that was his na
me. And Œ and those people th
at my  father™s supposed  to 
come, they Œ they kept me, and because the 
Russians were back and forth for the last 
week or two. And a month later, on March 28
th
, the Russian occupied the whole 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
39 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
territory. So, this son-in-law
, Mucha
, mu st have known that the Russians were on th e 
border, or were within  150 miles of whatev e
r, because there was Œ back and forth they 
would progress, then they had to
 step back, then they  Œ and 
so they were very close to 
Koro lówka.
 And so he mu st have known, so th
at™s why he decided to make it unify. 
And so, when I went back in
 July of 209, an d I asked about this person, nobody 
seemed to know about him. 
So, the anti-Semi tism,  and the quietness, who did wh at, is 
very, very strong today, in 209. 
Q: So, the Russians came in in
 March, and you were, at th
at point, 11 years old, about? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: So, and Œ 
A: 12 or Œ or Œ no, 
right, 11. ™44, right. 
Q: And so, as Œ 
A: ™44, yeah. 
Q: So, your basic Œ you™re 
still a young child and you™re 
all by yourself. How did you 
Œ wh at was your reaction ab out liberation? 
You were liberated but an orphan, it mu st 
have Œ  
A: I didn™t Œ 
Q: Or did you know that your moth er Œ did 
you still think your mother might be alive? 
A: Well, that was the thing. I Œ I thought my
 mother was alive, a
nd I never thought of 
myself as a n  orphan either, 
because an orphan means that
 somebody is dead. Although 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
40 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
I know th at my  father and brother are de
ad, somehow, because I didn™t see it, they 
were not dead. So, it was a word, and it didn™t 
apply to me at all. A s a matter o f fact, 
through the whole 60 some years since ™65 Œ 
eight years, I still have the fantasy that 
my mother is alive, waiting for me. And my  granddaughter, who is eight years old, 
who is about that, you know, 10 years old, 
and I was saying to my  son and his family, 
I said, gee, I™m really
 afraid to go back. And my  granddaughter 
Meagan
 said, but what 
if your mo ther stands in front of the d
oor an d is waiting for you? And th at was the 
same fantasy that I had. She didn't tell me a
nything new, and that™s exa Œ exactly how I 
feel, that sh e is still, you know. So, I don™t know if I™m 
[indeciphera ble]
 teach on th at, 
from grandmother to granddaugh
ter, or whatever. But that was Œ and also when I think 
of home, I don™t think of my self as a 78 year 
Œ 78 year old wo man, I think of my self as 
10 and 11 and 14 and 15 years old. 

Q: After the Russians came, did you tr Œ go
 back to the house wh ere you grew  up? 
A: Yeah. I Œ when the Russi
ans came back, just what I did all the other times, 
whenever Œ after the first killing of, we all 
went back to the same place to see who 
survived. And all the people in 
Koro ló wka
 went back to 
Koro lówka 
and Œ an d Œ and 
first of all, my  house, or the whole of 
Koro lówka, 
all the Jewish houses were 
destroyed, so it Œ there wouldn™t be any Jewi
sh house left. The only
 thing that was left 
was the synagogue and th
e Jewish cemetery, that™s all that was left. 
Q: And, did you find anyone? 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
41 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
A: And the pharmacy, and the pharmacy. 
Q: Did you find anyone to stay 
with, or were you staying alone? 

A: Well, I found an uncle and aunt, my moth
er™s brother. My mo ther™s brother and his 
wife, they were hiding someplace else. 
And I stayed with them, and we left 
Koro lówka, 
and Œ oh, we moved to
 Borschev
. And my  uncle served
 in the army for Œ 
in the Russian army. And then
 we left. We Œ we left 
Borschev
 in ™45, as soon as the 
war was over, and we went to 
Germany
, and I was Œ we were all in a displace Œ 
Q: All three of you? 

A: All three of us. And I signed up to come to the 
United States
, and came in ™47, and 
Œ 1947 in  August, and Œ and Œ and came to 
New York
, and Œ and I th
ink you have 
some of the pictures at the muse
um, of the Œ of the place, the 
DP
 camp that we stayed. 
And Œ and th en Œ 

Q: Were you with your aunt 
and uncle at this point also? 
A: No, th ey wouldn™t allow 
them to come to Œ to the 
United States,
 so I could co me 
on th e children™s visa, and there was, from 
U.N.
 all one Œ 
U.S.
 something, a Mrs. 
Brown.
 She was, I think mu st have been a so
cial worker. She was just so nice, she 
talked so polite. And I wasn't 
sure of my birth date, and 
my birth Œ and I Œ I know I 
was born in March, but I wasn™t sure. She 
said, and wh at month would you like? And I 
loved my little brother, and he 
was born in May. So I said, I think I was born in March, 
but I love May, because the way I held on 
to my family is reme
mbering things about 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
42 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
them, not as much about me. So, if I rememb
er all those little thi
ngs about them, they 
were never Œ they never died
, you know. So sh e said, oh, May is a lovely month, how 
about May? So we put down May 28
th
, but I™m not totally sure of my birth date. We 
have a Œ and one of the reasons too, I went ba
ck in Œ in July of 
209, is another person 
told me they went back and 
they found their birth date in
 the school records, and I 
went for one year to school. I said, oh, I mu
st go back and see if they have the record. 
And of course, that wasn™t true. 
Q: And, so when  you got to the 
States
 were you living alone, or did anyone adopt you, 
or Œ 
A: Oh, no, no. They took the 
children to a Œ oh, I should 
have written down the name 
of the places Œ to the 
Bro nx
. Oh, I want to say Œ anyways, it was a Œ an 
orph agenage
, 
and then the Jewish Family and Children Service asked the kids where they want Œ 

some of them had relatives in 
New York
, some of the Œ and, of co urse, every Œ I 
wanted to stay in 
New York
. And the reason was, in case
 anything happened , I could 
take a boat right back. So, there was this la
dy, another very nice person, and said, well, 
where would you like to go? There™s a pl 
Œ Jewish Family and Ch ildren right now, 
Chicago
 or 
Boston
. And so  I said, well, is
 Boston 
on the coast, you know. Yes, it is. 
So I went to 
Bo sto n , 
and th e Jewish and Family and 
Children™s Service took me in, 
and they found adoptive fam
ilies for me, and they found 
very nice families and they 
wanted to  adopt me so badly. There was a Mrs. 
Wachs
(ph) and 
Morris Wachs
(ph), 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
43 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
he was a soldier in Œ in Œ in Œ in 
Germany
. And Œ and they were so nice, they had no 
children. And I just couldn™t be adopted, be
cause you see, I had all those birthdays and 
all those little things in my 
heart, that I didn't tell a
nybody. And so 
I couldn™t be 
adopted. S-So I remember one time, it was an
other nice family that I don™t know, they 
di Œ I don™t think they wanted
 to adopt me, but anyways, I 
sort of ran away from them 
an-and ended up at the harbor
 when the agency found me. So
 they found a Œ a Œ a very 
nice overnight school for ma Œ for me, called the 
Windsor
 Mountain School in 
Lenox
, 
and it™s a high school. And I went there, a
nd it was the most marvelous, beautiful place 
for me, because I was among kids who were ki
ds in this school, and I didn™t have to 
give loyalty to somebody that
 Œ that wasn™t mine. Do y Œ do you understand? I didn 't 
have to lo ve anybody except from sheer goodwill.
 So I was in this beautiful school that 
saved my  soul. You know, maybe coming to the 
United States 
saved my  life, but that 
school saved my  soul. And also, what I disc
overed is books and re
ading. And so, after 
I graduate, I applied for scholarships, got sc
holarships. Oh, the first year, I was with 
the Jewish Family Servi Œ ther
e was a social worker named
 Edith Costa
, and she took 
us to 
Revere
 beach, around here, and we had 
an accident, and I broke my nose 
because I was sitting on somebody™s lap. An
d bingo, like this, and 
so I got 500 dollars 
for the broken nose. So when  I graduated 
high school, I applied fo r a scholarship and I 

had 500 dollars, that paid fo
r room and board , and I got scholarship . And then , when  I 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
44 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
graduated from Œ with my  belach
 Œ bach elor™s, I applied to the 
VA 
and got a 
scholarship to go to  school of social work.  
Q: And let me ask about your deci
sion to beco me a social worker. 
A: Well, I think Mrs. 
Brown
, the first perso n  that was so inviting; then I had a Œ a 
social worker named Mrs. 
Levine
, who wa Œ who to ld me al
ways, don™t worry, that™s 
okay, if I messed up. That™s okay. And 
Œ and she Œ and there was a woman in  
particular, Mrs. 
Carter,
 of the Jewish Family and Ch
ildren™s Service, who worked 
very hard to  get money to send kids like us
 to a private school. And there were other 
kids, and it was really Mrs. 
Carter
 that made the difference.  
Q: Let me just ask if there™s anything else that you would like to say that we haven™t 
covered? 
A: Well, not in terms necessarily of my st
ory, because I™m telling my  story 68 to  69 

years later, as an old woman. The silence fo
r me was not that it didn™t happen, but the 
silence for me Œ are you looking at Œ 

Q: No, no, no, I just Œ 

A: The silence for me was to keep everyt
hing in place. And if I talk about the 

Holo caust, or missing my  mo ther, or wantin g 
my  father so badly, and when  in Œ and 
not going to  my  own graduati
ons, because I didn't  have who I wanted, was because I 
mig h t  lo se th at in  my  memo ry
. That if I share those truths with somebody else, then 

that might be taken aw ay, too. And it was 
a peculiar kind of thinking. And I™ve been 

Interview with Feiga Hollenb erg Co nn ors 
45 
October 8, 2010 
  

 
 
sort of reading more about it, and Œ and th
e kids, my  own children, who run from 50 to 
40 now, really are telling me now how th
ey  wo ndered why they didn™t have a 
grandmother and why I never 
talked about it. And my hus
band too. And Œ and my  
husband in particular felt that he wa Œ I 
was who I was, he didn™t need Œ he knew 
enough to  know, but I did-didn™t have to ta
lk about it, and the same thing his family. 

His ma Œ  h is mo m, th at  I lik
e very much, my mother-in-la
w said, don™t Œ don™t hurt her 
any more. So, it was really Œ the thing that I th
ink need s to be shared  is not that I want 
to forget them, but I just need to say it.
 I don™t know if that™s appropriate or not, 
because it™s not the story 
Q: Oh absolutely. No, 
it™s absolutely appropriate, and ju
st want to thank you so much 
for sharing it and just Œ despite the pain. 
We™re very grateful. Thank you so mu ch . 
A: Okay .
