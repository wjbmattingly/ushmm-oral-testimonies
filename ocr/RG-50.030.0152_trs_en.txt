one of those fr om that ge nerati

the end of t h e ghet t o.  Uh...So I lived t here a 
long time with my fami
ly.  Uh...We were...my 
i mme diat ely  fa mil y in my ho use , we wer e  
four children in the 
house of my parents 
and...uh...we  were born...uh... 
 We  all were...all our childre
n are bor n on the sa me  house  
whi c h  was  P a wi a 31  in  th
e heart of the Jewish co

A:My...my family and my
 c hildhood.  Whe n I  look bac k at  
my c hildhood, I  co
unt ..what wa s my 
childhood?   How ma ny years  wa
s  my c hildhood?   Today whe n
 I compare it 
wi th my  o wn  
childr en a nd my gra ndc hi ldren...uh...my c hil dhoo
d...uh...was onl y a fe w ye
ars.  At the age of 
4 I was sent  to school .  I come
 fr om a very religious home a
nd at t he age of 5, it was not 
onl y me, but my entir e fa mi ly. 
 Every chil d at t he age of 5 supposed t o know Hoolish

and...uh...to recite Chumash, th
e Bibl e. And uh...I  wa s se nt i n
 mi ne c hildhood to a He bre w  
school wher e I learne d J ewi shnes s
, He bre w, r eli gion for five years .  Uh...Thi s wa s in t he age  
bet wee n 6 a nd 5 a nd 10.  Uh...T
hen...uh...I was very invol ve d
...I was ve ry active i n...i n the  
under...i n the street .  I wa s allo
we d many friends.  We played 
ball in the street.  Some of 
us...we coul dn't a fford t o  have a ball beca use  this  wa s too luxurious  so 
we wer e  pl ayi ng  wit h  
some stac ki ng st uff wit h..
.uh...wi th garbage and this wa s our 
ball .  I wil l  never forget that  
there always was th
e...if the ball will fall in
to...uh...to a wet spot, be
come so heavy, I never  
coul d have touc he d, and i f you we re hit  with
 such a ba ll I reme mb
er it was...uh...very 
painful.  And also a
ll the water was splashed
 over you, and I'll neve
r forget t he...the wet  
balls whi ch we wer e pla ying.  Uh...I  don't kn
ow I was alwa ys...uh...in that group of the 
childr en...I was very act iv
e and...uh...I spent 
a l ot of ti me also playi ng 
in the street, all in the 
bac k yar d.  And I went to sc hool .  I  only had t o  ma ke sure
 that my home w ork is ma de 
because my mother had 
t o ins pect my home work ever y ni ght
 and t he n my older siste r...she  
was inspecti ng everyt hi ng which was in Po
lish because she was goi n g to the Polish 
schools...Polish gymnasium.  In 
my hous e and...uh...l
i ke in ot her house much more att ention 
wa s gi ven t o  the e duc ation of t he gir l s  than...tha
n the boys.  Bo ys got a
ll kinds of educati ons , 
but the girls were spent to special schools.  So 
mi ne sist er was the...t he more educated i n the 
home , and s he was als o the ol dest s o  she wa
s al wa ys ...uh...watchi ng 
over  our ho me work. 
And...uh...a ft er 
5 year s, I beca me a re bel and I sai d that I don't  want t o go j ust to a Yiddish  
school , He br ew school.  I  wa nt t o go t o the  sc
hool of the c ountr y, a nd 
I insisted I am goi ng 
to a public school.  For my pa
rents it was a little bit, you know
, painful that I don't want to  
go on wit h the onl y Yiddish e ducati on, He bre w 
education, but I wa nt to get, you know, t he  
general education.  But I won that battle 
as a youngster and.
..uh...finally mine 
pare nts ...uh...agr eed that  I shoul d go t o the  sc
hool.  Maybe bas i cally t he y a gree d be ca us e it 
was also much more ec
onomic al.  In the publ ic s c hool we
 didn't have to pay anything, and 
the He bre w school , whi c h was ver y expensi ve t o
 us ...for us , and...uh
...and I joined that 
public sc hool and I wa s a very, very please d and happy good st ude nt.  Ther e I was not only

wit h Je wis h chil dren ,  I was t oget her wi
t h...uh...Catholic 
boys , frie nds a nd I  
developed...uh...large fri endshi p
 a mo ng t hes e gr oups , young peopl e.  We belong al so t o  the 
sport clubs and...uh...t he  school le ft on me 
a tremendous ma rk on my
 life.  Uh...All my  
teachers wer e of my idol s.  I 
was ver y lucky with teacher s.  
I...I thi nk and so
me ot her kids  
thought that wa y about thei
r teache rs that we  had the best  teachers in the world.  They really 
cared for  us and they t aught us, 
and I have a lot of re
spect for t he teachers.
  Uh...The  tea che r  
played a ver y i mport ant  role i n
 my l i fe , and...uh.
..t o s o me  extent...uh...e v en mi ne  par ents  
beca me jeal ous .  Why do I list e n s o muc h to
 t he teacher s and...
uh....not paying enough 
attenti on for...for our rules for generat ions were 
established in my fa mily
 a nd...uh...t he mai n  
rules were...the...we call it in Yiddish...   
    , that means respect  for t he parents 
and...uh...although my  fa ther ne
ver hurt me...my father never 
raised a hand on...ne ver la id a 
hand on me , but I wa s always a fr ai d for my fa
t her.  He was the aut
hority and...uh...the 
authority was also in a sens
e, you know, when we  had to
 go int o  the di ni ng room 
and...uh...eating, we ne
ver...none of us would sit down at th
e table if Father will not come in 
to sit down.  Thi s was a wa y of
 res pe ct.  Als o bec ause of t he l angua ge, we  never a ddre ssed  
our parents on a fi rs
t name...you.  I never turn
ed to my Father and sa
id, "You will do this." 
That will be disrespect.  So we
 always addressed Fa ther and Mother in 
the way...Mother do 
or Father do...but we never 
tell them you should do it.  Uh
...You will do it, 
but...uh...always  
that gave a distance.   
 

Q:Tell me a little bit 
about your family. 
 

A:M y fa mily...uh... 

 

Q: Yo u came  from a large fa mily.

A:I came fr om a very...all Jewish 
famil ies were large.  I came
 from a family which was for 
generati ons l i ving in the s a me 
city in Wa rsa w .  My gra ndfat he r whi ch was great gr andfather  
whi ch wa s well known in the ...in Wa rsa w , ha d a laundr y bus
i nes s, a nd hi s na me wa s  
              
.  It wa s a very well known lau
ndr y.  He ha d 18 c hildre n a nd.
..uh...I don't reme mber now the 
na mes of all  the childr en, but I wa s a  youngst er 
coming to the...for a
ll the holidays to my  
great grandfather and I r e membered
 big t abl e.  It 's li ke a...l
i k e a hole.  There were t h ree 
rooms whi c h were opened t he wa
lls in order to acco
mmodate all the peopl
e, a nd we sat at  
the table.  My gr and great fat her had, as I 
sai d , ha d 18 chi l dren.  M y grandfat her had 9 
children, and I come  fr om
 a fa mily of 4.  I don'
t know i f t he c al culati on i s c orrect , but I  t hink 
we were be twe en 300 t o 400 pe opl e of
 one fa mil y in Wa rsa w 
under the same name . 
            
.  And it was  a Hasi dic fa mil y, a
ll belonging to the Ha
sidic sect of the Al
e xander Ra bbi.  We  
all...uh...ass e mbled...uh...on Sa
t urdays, especiall y  on Sat ur day
s.   We ca me  to t he s a me 
synagogue a nd on holida y, we de finit ely made sur e
 that we are in one t he same place.  Eve n  

people which were out of town 
had t o c o me bac k  and to be 
in the same  synagogue praying 
together.  That I think it was 
something like a traditio
n that wherever you were...but fo r the 
High Holi da ys, we  all ca me  toget her .   
 

Q: What  happened wh
en the Nazis came?  
 

A: Wh en the Nazis came I already wa
s...uh...gr own- up. 
 What you call  gr own-up
, a t eenager in mi ne  
age was a grown- up.  As a teenage I already 
wa s earni ng a l i ving, going to school at  the  
sa me ti me worki ng, ea rning a livi ng, being 
r esponsi ble for helping the fa mily, being 
responsible for hel ping the 
educ ation whi ch was very         
   we nt to hi gh school.  It wa s  
very expe nsi ve, so I ha d to 
earn money to pa y for t he high 
school , help wit h my si ster,  
and...uh...I wa s very much alr
eady involved in...in.
..uh...organizational 
life before the war 
beca use mi ne ge nerat i on gre w up in a...ge
nera tion of i dea lis m.  Most  of my fr ie nds  
belonged t o orga niza tions.  Zionis
ts .  Bundi sts .  Sociali sts.  Co
mmuni sts.   Reli gions gr oups.

We have all kind of gr
oups.  And we all ha d...uh... outl ook
s on life and we wer e alrea dy...we 
were...we were know
ledgeable about the.
..the possibilities of...uh...of
 war ...of the expansion 
polici es of Ger ma n y...uh...  The fi rst feel in
gs o f war ca me to us  wh en Au stria  wa s  
incor porated, the Anschluss.  Then it was 
t he . ..t he ta king over by the Pol es, par t  of 
Czechoslovakia...uh, I don'
t know it wa s a pact among Poland 
in Germany to divide part of 
the Czechoslovakia and...uh...we
 already saw mo
re and more militaristic
 movements and we  
wer e pr epa re d that s o met hing had ha ppened, but 
we didn't...were not prep ared it'll happen so 
rapidl y and that 's why when th
e German attacked Poland  Se
ptember 1st, th
ey called it 
"blitzkrieg" [
Ger:
 "Lightning Wa r"].   We were...were 
looking at the...at t he Amer ican...at 
the Polis h Ar my, whic h wa s alrea dy bea uti ful dr
e ssed, the offi cers of be aut i ful shi ny shoes 
and we rea l l y looke d at the m like a ...a real de fe ns e group whi ch wi ll be a ble to de fend the  

country.  But...uh... shockingly e nough, I th
ink all the military lin
es were broke n by the  
Ger ma ns  wi thin on e d a y , an d wi
thin the second da
y, the city of Wa
rsaw wa s bombarded 
wh ere ver yo u were ther e .  An d we wer e  n ot 
even prepared that t h
ey are...when we saw 
planes fl ying we ...e ver ybody sai d 
it 's our pla nes .  I t 's our  pla nes
.  We  di d not realiz e that we  
did not  ha ve  an air force  anymore tha t  last ...t
he  fir st t wo da ys .  And ther e wer e the Ger ma n  
planes flyi ng over us, bombardi ng us , and withi n
 a  fe w da ys Warsa w wa
s ...uh...encircle d by 
the Ger mans.  I think it was...
uh...Se pte mber 7, when
...uh... over  the ra
dio ca me...uh...the 
appeal that all people which are abl e to ca
rry wea pons, me n s peciall y, ar e  being a ske d to 
leave t he cit y and to go to the east  where 
new defense li nes are 
being created.  I wa s 
attached so much to
 my  fa mil y a nd  I felt  that  e v en we
 are al ready ever yday hi ding i n t he 
bunker s in t he cellar s I coul dn't
 leave  my fa mil y and I di d not.
..uh...follow that appeal, but  
mo st of my  friends left on th
at day and they went east t o war d
 t he Russia n s i de.  We  di d not  
even know in that days
 that Poland...that the 
dec i sion was  ma de t hat Pola nd will  be di vide d 
bet wee n Rus sian a nd Ger ma ny, but we felt that 
it is safer to go towa
r d Russia, especially 
those who believed in th
e...in the possibilities of
 a socialist communist 
government fe
lt that 
the ha ven wi ll be  found on t he other s i de where  we
 ha d...uh...believe d t hat
...uh...a ft er all  it 's

a communist regime, a mo
re hu manitarian regime.  We kn
ew very little really about the 
true...what is...what it is
 t hat govern ment.  And.
..uh...a  lot of peopl e le
ft , but I choose to be 
with my fa mily, and I 
did not leave.  And I was waiting 
in...with the ghett o went throug h 
that...was 30 da ys until  t he Ger ma ns  we re 
occupy Warsaw because 
we  were...defending 
Wa rsa w .  We were doi ng ever ything t o help 
eac h other , but  we coul
dn't  do anythi ng against  
the planes which were bombard
ing and thousands upo
n thousands of people...civilians were 
killed fr om t he Ger ma n bombardme nt, Je ws a
nd non- Je ws.  In those days...in t he Wa rsaw 
we were fr ee...we felt as Polis
h citiz e ns de fending the countr y and putti ng up the last st and 
agai nst t he Ger mans, not all o wi
ng them to come in
.  And that  came 
until the day when 
Warsaw capi tulated.  The war  ca
me t o an end, and th
e  Ger ma ns mar c he d i n.  Then star ts a  
di fferent chapter of my  life .  
We  wer e all hungr y.  I do re me
mber t he fir st days when the 
Ger ma n c a m e in.  It was a para de .  I wa s not co
ming t o that parade bec aus e it 's not  in our  
neighborhood.  I was li vi ng in t he J e wis h se ction, but I r ecall  that...I know that pe opl e told 
us t here was a parade in the...in
 the main             
where t he Ger mans...t he victorious 
Ger ma ns  ma rche d into Po
land.  And...uh...everyb
ody was more int erest ed
 in that time  in 
fi ndi ng a pie ce of br ead.  Final l y, we  heard t hat
 a  fe w tr ucks arrive d 
at the corner not  far  
where I  was living a nd...uh...the y 
wer e gi ving out brea d.  So na
turally I was th
e first on e of 
the fa mil y...t he young pe ople , 
me a n d my brot he r and my si
s...my siste r, we a ll runne d  
to...t o the pl aces where t hey givi ng
...uh...truck...uh the 
bread arrived.   And
...uh...t hat 's t rue. 
We  sa w the  trucks wit h l ooking 
only at the big truc
ks with br ead, our e y
es shined up that 
we're going to get a piece of br
ead.  There was so 
many people were wa
iting in the line, the  
brea d wa s not given out .  Ther e we re two Ge
r ma ns on the ...uh...tr ucks  throwing out the  
brea ds and t here 're ...and I sa w t he y were at  
that time camera
s filming this whole thing, how 
they're thr o wing bread t o the 
population.  An d I wa s also wa
iting t o gra b  a loa f of br ead, 
but ...uh...s ome how I wa s recogni ze
d by one of my nei ghbors .  
He sa ys , " What are you doing 
here?"  This is br ead for t he Po
l e s .  I  says , " S o I  a m her e ."   
He  says, "You're a Jew. "  That 
was the fi rst day when I 
was probably shocked and 
will never forget.  I le ft the line.  I came

bac k to t he bunker a nd di dn't 
bri ng br ead.  Mi ne brothe r, he 
was mor e lucky.  
And my s i ster  
was more lucky.  They came ba
ck wi th bread.  Each one of 
t he m ha d a l oa f.  And I who 
supposedly wa s the good organi
zer ...supposed to bring the br e a
d, ca me ba c k with not hi ng.  I  
wa s very much s hoc ke d that  th
is wa s sai d to me  
to a ma n whom I kne w and he sai d  the 
brea d are  for Poles .  And all of a  s udden I who gr ew up 
with ideas of Poles was hurt  
that...look at th
is, my own Polish comrade, my own 
Polish neighbors ar
e calling me, "The 
Jew."  I know that...uh.
..there was a note of th
e anti-semitism before war,
 but I did not see it 
beca use I di dn't want s ee i t .  I only sa w the good
ness in the Polish people.  I saw goodness in 
every people.  But I will 
not forget that first day when my 
eyes of the hung
er saw the bread 
and just wa s so abuse d t h at 
I went  ba c k wit hout br ead.   
 
Q: Wh at then happened?  

 

A: The n...uh... We ha d to come 
out from the cellars.  And whoeve
r was lucky, whose a pa r t me nt was  
not bombe d  out , we  went i n...bac k to t h
eir  apart ments, t hose 
who had t he bombed 
apart ments and there were many of them ha
d t o fi nd s helt e r a mong ot hers .  So to our  
apartment we were joined by ot
her members of the 
fa mi ly whi c h hous es were bombe d and  
they were sharing with 
us the apartment.  Then
 beca me the  daily struggl e  of fi ndi ng food. 
Uh...That oc cupi es our mi nds .  Nobody wa s exp
ect any...uh...special , di fferent trea t ments ... 
uh...that  we would be  chose n.  We
 knew that we lost the war.  What ...we believed that this is 
not the end, that war be gins, but war has to 
end.  And we were counting on the war to...I 

know t hat t h e France j oi ned i m mediately and 
England j oined t he war i mmediatel y, and we 
also hoped that the Russians w
ill and we felt that this is a 
period which we have to come  
through and survive.  But then
 bec o me the di ffic ult ...the 
s econd di ffi c ulty whic h ca me  
was...it was winter.  It 
was...uh...that winter it 
was September, it's gettin
g cold and we had to 
fi nd als o not  onl y food, but we 
ha d t o fi nd als o me an

wer e not rul ed anymore by the ge ner al commun

in that time and completely 
destr o yed, but there was a city
 hall, a Polish city hall. 
Uh...Commu nications was not disr

hones in our houses.  We had 
electrici ty i n our house s whic h wa s...re stor

And...uh...little
 by little life started to get

but ...uh...t hose who st i ll ha

them.  In those days we still knew the names of 
the people and people had individual burial. 
And...uh...we had to st
ruggle for the daily li fe.  That wa

 you are going?   We  
are here.  We should be here t

there...I did not leave you on the September 7th, mayb
e I will go now if 
there's a possibility 
that we will be able to live 
over there, maybe ever
ybody will possible move

 me a bundle of drafts of people 
owing hi m mone y in
 the east.  "I 
cannot  gi ve you a nyt hing el se.  Ta ke  the se dra f
t s.  Whenever you're goi
ng to be in the east,  
try to collect something 
and maybe this will help 
you to live."  Natura
lly, I was...uh...going 
around lat er on, when I a rrive d in the East , I co
lle cted ve ry litt le.  I...pe opl e said, " What do 
you mea n.   We 're  not...
we  haven't got our own mo ney.  Ho
w can we pa y you? "  So t hat wa s  
not ...uh...not  help.  I wa s joine d by a 
friend, who wa s a very c l ose frie nd of 
mine,                . 
He was...uh...c oming fr
om a  ver y ri c h fa mil y.  He was 
t he only son.  An
d...uh...whe n  we 
bot h de cide d to leave Warsa w a nd t o go t o the 
East , I pr omised his pare nts that I wi ll be 
always gua r ding hi m a n d the y felt more se cure
 that he 's going...c
oming with me .  And 
fi nall y, you know, a ft e r two atte mpts of s m
uggling the borders to 
the East, I finally 
succeeded.  And I re
me mb er I ca me  to the Bi
al ystok.  When I alre
ady wa s on the way, the  
mi ddle  of the ni ght t o Bi alyst o
k, I ha d to cross t h e railr oads
 (pause) station, and I saw the  
fir st men on the bri dge.  And 
I s aw t he first me n on t he bri dge
...uh...and I  says ...well ....w e  
wal ke d over  and we sai d...t he middl e of the 
night, I said, "Sir, we are coming now from 
Wa rsa w .  Coul d you tell  us wh
er e ar e we now? "   So he sa ys , "You are i n...al most i n  the  
heart of Bial ystok.  So I aske d 
hi m, " What i s the s ituati on."  He sa ys...I  wil l  never forge t , he  
said, "It 's  wonder ful ."  But...uh.
..I  want you t o r e me mber  you're
 weari ng a hat.  You will  die  
in this hat.  I did not underst
and the fi rst mo ment what he wa
nted to tell me .  Well after 
wal king...a ft er parti ng wi th that
 ma n, I wal ke d another ...uh...f ew mi nut es on t he bri dge.  It  
wa s col d and I took t he hat and I t hre w it out.  And my
 frie nd               asked me, " What  di d 
you do? "  I says , " You hear d what 
t hat man said.  He s aid you're
 going t o die in t hat  hat. 
Why shoul d I wa lk wit h t hat hat?
  I throw it out."  Later on, I 
r e alized what t hat man wanted 
to tell me.  Everything is good, 
but you'll never be able to buy a
nother hat.  So that's why he 
say, "You're going to die in that hat."  Th
at was my fir s t experi
ence ...encounter wit h  
some body li ving.  But I 
ca me to Bi al ystok a nd t h e fi rst 
thing I wa s looki ng
 how do I get a

uh...after

 can we do 
and I did not think that to join
 the ot her gr oups which were  tr

Why?  I missed th

Maybe t her e is a r ay of hope. 
He never s p oke to me .  I don't know exactl y wh

  And li fe bec a me, 
you know...uh...we had to adju

That went down until probably  
Februar y or March.  I ha ppe ne d to meet a  frie

of t he yout h move me nt wher

..I di d not know why he is a s

  About 2 we e ks later he

 in the house s  and I wa
s...uh...in t hat hous e  
where I  was  living, pr ob

ung man a nd whe n  a co mmunit y was creat e d, I  
became the secretar y of t he co

 wer e agai n co

and...uh...since there were no sc
hools...all schools were
 illegal...I organized 
a school in mine 
buil ding, and I  be ca me  t he t eac her of that  s ch

ea gerly to sc hool beca us
e part of their work 
wa s a soup.  And everybody of 
the children was waiting when w
ill we get that soup.  So a 
child wa s...t he chil dre n wer e so hungry s o that
 coming to school is because they knew that  
duri ng t he s chool hour s they wi

they ca me t o  school .  The n I was ...uh...by coi n
ci de nt, I wa s gi ven a j ob whe n the ghetto wa s

That pr obabl y...uh...wa s a  ver y

.to demolish them, but 
not de molis h the m by de moli sh 
be caus e t he br icks  were  very i mporta nt.  So we had to  
take...go on the top of a burned

...pot atoes , a gains t that cl othi ng whic h we brought out and 
this was a tremendous help if I 
was able to come back with th

and brought back some food.  So
 it was not a question of gettin

It was a que stion how much ca n I br ing ba ck 
to fe ed the family.  And...uh...somehow we  
wer e guar d ed by...uh...a Ger ma n...older  
Ger mans which were pr obabl y mobi lized

 An d  ther e wa s one  Ger ma n  who  was  i n o ur

whi l e we we re worki ng a nd...uh..

It was probably a man in
 the 50's, an older ma n or in 40s,
 l ate 40s or 50s.  But he never  
screa me d .  There wer e ot hers t hat wer e screa m

were even afraid for 
the screaming of the Germans.  He was never sc

he was a good man. 

And whenever I tur ned t o hi m,

 And...uh...I don'

.uh...to the...to the.
..t o the brigade...to  
...and when we c a me  t o t he...
uh...t o t he gate  to go thr o
ugh, s o me how,
 I don't know 
why....what wa s t he r eas on, th
e Ger man who was i nspecti n g us
 asked...picked 
on...on that 
girl which I took with 
me which it normally wa
s not happen...says, "Y
ou go into the booth. 
I got to ins p ect you.."  Now I 
know that...uh...what ha ppe ne d 
with her that she had...uh... 
documents...the ma p of the Tr
eblinka which was drawn in 
t he  ghe tto by peopl e who c a m e  
bac k from Treblinka t o be sent
 by t he  undergr ound an
d...uh...t o...t o Londo
n.  So we ha d to  
bring it out fr om the ghetto. 
 She was carr ying th
at docume nt.  Whil
e she was i n the  
booth...while  she wa s in the booth, the  only th
i ng whi ch I know that her na me was Fei g a and  
Vla dka, wi th two na me s s he gave me .  Whil e 
s he  wa s i n the boot h, so
me commotion started 
and a shooti ng start ed on the 
out side and t he  Ger man le ft  
her al one , not  completi ng the  
search and r un out t o see what 's the shoo
ting.  And there 
wa s a s hoot i ng a bout a not her  
group, not in the group with ou
r group.  She ra pi dly dre sse d 
herse l f a nd s he c a me up wit h  
me to the group because we 
could not leave until 
and she...we walked
...we were given 
permission to walk.  And she 
was not completely searched.  
(Si gh)   Today, I shoul d, yo u 
know i f I r ec all it, you know, la
ter on when I found out what sh
e was carrying, I don't think 
that I would risk the life of 
the whole group because if that 
document will be found on her, 
probabl y t he  whol e hundred pe ople  
or what ever , all of us will  be
 kill ed.  I  d
on't know if I

I  did not know.  And...uh...s he

 I came back t o the  
ghetto a lot of time the people
 of the under ground a ske d me

 who is that Vladka.  (Sig

they e ver know how I ca

Th e passport...uh...wi th all th

And I aske d for that girl duri ng...in the...on th

I asked for Vladka.  Fi nally, some

together as Christians both in

 Both of us coul d not re veal t hat we  have

A: Ok ay .  

                
                
                
                
Q:Tell us a little bit abou
t another date you had wit h  
Vladka.   
A: Uh .. . The dates wit h Vladk a  wa
s...uh...in the beginnin
g.... uh... we met  agai
n...uh...on a Su nday. 
We  so mehow developed...
uh...a ver y  comfortable  relation, 
much more t h an a fri endship. 
She l ost her entire family.  Wh
e n she wa s in the Aryan side , 
s h e kne w t hat she had nobody 
left.  All her  fa mi ly...the pare nt
s, their fa ther died fr om hung
er in the ghet to.  The mot her  
and the br ot her and the s i ster were s h ippe d to
 Treblinka and entire fa
mil y.  She became the 
onl y pers on.  And...uh
...while I wa s meeting wit h her, I st
arted to look in what are she doing  
aski ng que st ions , not al ways s he ga ve  me the fu ll ans wer s, but  she onl y ke pt tell me ...I wa s  

in the ghett o this week again. 
 I s aid, " What did you do there .
"  "I brought ou
t a few chi l dren 
fr om t here t o pl ace t hem i n hidi ng places."   
And...uh...the next week
, I found...I met her  
agai n, I  sa ys, " O h, I know I ha ve  regar ds 
for  you.  I met some bo
dy in the ghetto 
and....uh...he asked me 
a b out you."  They i n th

outsi de the  ghetto, and she tol d me ...they 
br ought me r egar ds from the m, and she  
says ...uh...t hat there pr obabl y 
those people were looking for 
regards to be able to get a 
cont act.  M a ybe I ca n he lp the m to c o me on the Ar yan si de .  I did not t el l  you t he st ory of 

mi ne...how did I  bri ng 
them...by that time I 
already had my  entir e, 
my  l i vin g  fa mil y , my  
father, my mother, my sister, my
 brother with 
me in hiding on the Ar
yan side.  I will come 
back to that story a little bit la
ter again, because it's 
interesting to tell 
which way we brought 
them out and what was t he reacti
on when I came first 
t o my parents and t ell them I want to  
take them to the Aryan side.  But...uh...little by little, I 
started to find out 
that...uh...Vladka is

so emer ged in t hat work of th
e  unde rground.  So only on a  
Sunday we were 
able to meet 
beca use this wa s the free day.  We di d not have 
where to go.  We were 
a fr aid...uh..
.t o...t o go 
into any public place, so we used to walk 
on t he beac h...uh...on th
e Vis t u l a wh ere fe w fe w 
people goes .  It was cold and very fe w peopl
e woul d wal k ther e beca use it was too c old, but  
we felt quite safe there.  And 
most of  our date s were just by wal king.  We never t ook any 
chance of going into a mo vie theater.  I don'
t  re me mb er .  I wa s n ot 
i n a ny movi e theater  
during the war.  I don't know if 
there were theaters.  But to any 
ca fe shops, it was a n end. 
She had a pl ace where t h ey were
 eati ng...uh...a
nd most of the 
member s of the under ground  
wer e dur ing the week meeting ther e and it wa
s a place, a public pl ace where t heir eating 
lunc hes .  So on a Sunday when s he was s ure
 that none of the...
her colleagues of the 
undergr ound will be ther e, she 
took me t o that place to eat l
unch.  It was a ver y decent,  
cultur al place where we wer e comi ng in and eati n
g lunc h the r e.  It was not a restaura nt , but  
it was like a club maybe, but it wa
s a place wher e for t hat when 
it was cold we used to sit  
there for hours eating lunch and 
talking.  And little by little our.
..she started to tell me, she 
got more c onfide nce i n me .  She s ai d, " Today 
I wa s abl e to buy t w o re volver s."  I l o oke d at 
her.  I says, " What do you kn
ow about re vol vers?   How do yo
u buy it? "  And she  tol d  me 
the stor y how she  bought t he r e
vol vers.  And she came back
 one  day and tol d me  that  
her...that she was able to test a bomb together
...uh...wi th...uh...Mr..
.wit h Kle p fis z, Mi chal  
Kle p fisz, which was an e ngi neer .  I says, " Why 
ar e you getting involved in suc h thing?   It's  
danger ous ."  I was more concer
ned a bout her t ha n about t he 
bomb and..uh... 
 Anyway she 
promi sed me ...I re me mbe r  that , "I
 a m not goi ng to do suc h t hin
g anymore."  I 
don't know if 
she just ma de me feel good bu
t I wa s more c onc erne d about 
her.  I became very much 
attached t o her.  And I  
was counti ng the...the hour
s, the days wh en I a m 
going to me et again.  
No w I know that...uh...
our meeti ngs did not ...wer e not  abl e
 to occ ur too ofte n beca use  she  
was involved in traveling to co

..once she told me that she's 
goi ng to Ra dom a nd s he  aske d me i f  I kne w a n
ybody in Ra dom.  By c oi ncidenc e I kne w  
that there was...one of my  neig

lady's na me ...the y ar e bot h ali ve.
..the  hus ba nd, the  wi fe, Meltz er.
..for they were neighbors of 
my house.  They were working in that con
cen...in t hat l abor camp
 in Radom.  So she 
wa s...s he c a me t o Radom...she ha d t o look al so fo
r a contact.  So she asked the i n mates, she 
came as a Christian on t he ot her si de of th
e fence and she 
asked  about...uh...who knew 
Meltzer .  Naturall y Mel t zer came over.  And 
she told Mel t z er that she 's  bringi ng re gard s  
from Benjamin             , so she had co
nfi dence because Vl adka ne
ver reveal ed that she's 
Je wish to these pe ople , 
but ...uh...when t hey
 hear d that t he Christian gi

they have  re gards fr om a Je
wi sh fellow which they know
, t hey got confi dence and she  
reveal ed that  she is from the 
under ground a nd she  wo
uld like to help.  Th
is became a major 
cont act for t he m and...uh...i
n that c a mp was M r . Meltz er a nd there we re other pe ople.  
Among t he m wer e als o  Mr. Duno

uh...she gave in that time and Mrs. 
Meltzer ...she asked her t o create a confi dent ial
 group in the ca mp of
...uh...put toget h er a  
group and she will be back a week later and sh
e will bring them whatev
er they need, mone y 
and doc u me ntation.  Vla dka ha
s it quite well wr i tten on her book on bot h side of t he  wall 
she has a chapter about 
Radom.  That's 
how I became a little bit 
more involved in kno w 
wh at is...what is she doing.  As 
a matt er of fact that were...Mrs
. Meltzer...uh...ga ve a piec e of  
paper to Vl a dka , a nd she  says, " List e n.  Be fore
 I wa s taken out from 
the  Wa rsa w ghe tto, I 
placed my little girl with a Ch
ristian woman.  Her a
ddress is so and so..
.uh...in Praga." 
And...uh...Vladka took th
at address and the next 
day, she went to visit th
at little girl, and she 
took me along.  And s o for the fi rst t i me .  
She t o ok me al ong beca use probabl y s he wante d 
to ma ke sure if I identify the 
girl that this is correctly.  So the first time I was involved  
through her in...i n the wo

undergr ound of he

and preparing...you know
, tr ying to bri n g out  
children.  But that was my fi rs
t e xperienc e of ac tually worki ng in t he undergr ound.  I wa s  
very restless and...uh...I wa s in
 hiding toget her with my par ent
s.  Fr om that contact whi ch I  
ma de on the  Ar ya n si de and it wa s 
in Praga        44, these 
pe ople  ha d t hei r...some  s hops i n  
the bac k of t he house  a n d...uh...
that  l ady...uh...agr eed
 to...to br ing my fa

brought.  We were about 9 people
 in that hiding...in a...in a 
small attic prob
ably the size 
of...uh...5 yards or 6 yards, on

 all sitting in that

working in that. 
 

Q: How di d you convi nce  
your pare nts  to c o me  to the Aryan side ? 
 

A: Okay.  Well, I  came b
ack to my parent s after 
worki ng alre ady dail y, an
d they saw t hat t he onl y 
place where I come back and I 
bring bread was fr om the Ar ya

deportati ons.  I start...uh...wor k
ing with my father and telling 
to him,  "Listen.  I have a 
place .  Let 's go out ."  My fathe r
 was not so mu ch c
onvinced, but we had...we had very close  
friend fr om the same  bu
il din g wh ich  we  were  
living.  He was the ch
air ma n of our ...of our  
house c o mmitt ee a nd my fat her was ve ry c l os e 
wit h  hi m.   He  was .
..uh...uh...more, you 
know...uh...he was not ...he was not
 a practicing so deeply religi

 fa t h er .  Hi s  
na me was Zi fer man, a nd when he  
he a rd t hat i dea , he s aid to my
 fat her , " Li sten.  I  wa nt you 
to go with your son, and I wo uld 
like to join you, but if you don't 
want to go at least give me  
a cha nce t o go."  So Mr . Zi fer ma n c o nvi nce d my 
fat her t hat we shoul d go t o the Ar ya n side . 

He  ha d a only s on, Ada m no..
.Adam.   They changed the name
 to Novak.  Mr. Zi ferman, 
Mrs. Zi fer m an came al so later and aft er the war,
 t hey li berate d...were

Nova k...Ada m Nova k.  They 
cha nged the na me on the  Arya n side , Ada m Nova k, who wa s  
born with me in the same hous
e...uh...a little bit you
nger than me.  So 
we were the three  
people of the  Zi fer ma n a n d we were four pe opl
e...or...five people of my
 immediate family in 
that s mall hi ding.  Fi nall y, I co
nvi nce d my father.  But here ca
me t he pr obl e m of my mother .  
My mot her wa s alrea dy...uh...
not a well ...was a sick woma

typically Jewish looking.  But 
my mo ther final l y wa s also c o

groups , I br ought up l at e

ugh ot hers , I brought t h

fr om the ghetto wit h a...wit h  a truck, not  wal king be caus e  
she c oul d not...not walk s uch a 
bi g wa y.  And fi nal l y I pl ace d the m
 all in that 
place .  And the  
onl y prot ecti on we had was Vla dka, whi c h s he ca me
 to...to us  very ofte n to inspect and the  
other lady, t he Chri stia n wo man, di d not know
 that...uh...Vladka is 
Je wi s h, but s he kne w 
that we are somehow 
connected wit h the un
der ground.  And we pa
i d mont hly for  our  
upkee p there , but it was not be
cause onl y of money.  Thes e...
uh...this woma n...t he J ul i ana  
which we were not only fi ve....t
he two fa milies, she had anot
her two other fa
milies.  She 
really worked hard for all of 
us .  What ever we c ont ribute d wa
s r eally peanuts agai nst  what i t  
cost, not talking about the 
ris ks.  Uh...But ...uh...
Jul i ana some how was ver y  
much...uh...c onn

uh...of Ger ma n des cent , a full...she  
spoke per fectly Ger man.  
And to cover up, she used to invite
 a lot of German officers to her 
house a nd s he used to ma ke partie s  and we we
r e al ways in the hi di ng i n  the other rooms  
whi l e t hey had partie s.  And t h
is for  her in...in t he house ...th
e...the Poli sh pe ople  looked a t  
her that she is somet hi ng...uh
...whi ch has c ont act wit h the Ger ma ns a nd pe ople didn't wa nt  
to have  to do a nyt hing t oo...
too much with her. 
 In t he me a nti me, s he wa s hi ding us, the  
Jews.  Anyway...uh...but t his 
pl ace one day we wer e discovered
.  And the Ger m
ans came to 
look in these houses for.
..for the Jews.  Lu ckily they did not fi

racle.  If they 
wo uld knock on one of the wall
s, they wo uld fo und all of us
.  We were...when they were 
searc hing the house , t he y were
 doi ng it in a ver y rapid wa y.
  So mebody squeezed on us, 
but ...uh...t he y did not know e xact

that we we r e  dis c overe d .  We ha d t o find a

me t o hi m I do not recall , 
but ...uh...Mr . ..uh...Kartos ha, whic

able to convince him that
 we will move in with 
our fa mily...uh...to ...u

the cemeter y.  He had a 
small  shack on the ceme

..uh...a place  for  his  
goats.  Uh...The goats occupied
 a very small place and he ga
ve us a little bit space in the

 that shac k of the goat s.  Uh..
.We really were not even able  
to...t o sit .  It wa s e nough spac e

his r oo ms, small  r ooms an

wa s...uh...ve ry....uh...probabl y un
usual that my fa ther agreed 
t o come  with me  on t he Ar ya n  
side under one condition.  That
 he will take along 
with him the tallis and tefillin.  And the  
greate st ar gume nt I had wit h my 
father was, " What do you ne ed  the Sadar ia? (Sidur?)"  He  
said, "When we will be liberated.
...we always believed that we

  Nat urall y, it 's a whol e hi story beca us e on 
January 19, there was the first

think was the first attempt to resist

uh...t he fir st s hot s  of t he under groun

Wa rsa w ghe tto.   That s t opped t he deport

wh at...what this prepared...w

the..that was in January, if I recall directly is 
the 18 of Ja nuary.  Thos

Not a word was mentioned tha t

That's just a free tr

A: Vladka wa s in dail y cont act . 
 She wa s...i n...by t hat ti me one 
of the major couriers of the

wa s...uh...a fine house ..hous e,

Vladka was, as t he main courier , mo ving ar ou

      .           
     which was a me mber of
 t he  under gr ound.  He was...still 
is alive and lives today in Isr

place where he came..
.I don't know if was this the fir st place, but th
e ni ght when they spent  
wa s in t he hous e of Vla dka 
and...uh...he re veale d  ever ythi

plea was, "I came out to you to try...let's try 
t o hel p.  And the y  beca me ver y invol ve d.  First  
of all was the plan of stormi ng
 the wall, which never materiali

did not  ha ve  the pe ople .  We c

 on t he pla n t o ge t the m out  
through the sewers.  And             
           or     
        showed us the 
way that if it is possible to 
come out of the ghetto,s o why cannot larger group

or...uh...or s ancti one d by the orga niz ations we re give n to us t o help us ge t the people out

brought the t rucks to a pl ace...uh...n
ear the Soboska Street 
i n...i n...

  If you dri ve , you be kill ed."  
I was not pr esent at t his, but Vl adka was present

"No.  I have a wi fe .  I have childr en.  We a r e too ma ny people .  Just take one of our fa mil y."

The...Vladka used to co
me and I...si nce t his 
was a ver y safe place t o
 be i n Ireland on the 
Ar yan side a nd i f you ca me i nto t his i t  wa s on Lu
gar, the street was Luga
r I think.   Luga r 25  
I felt very safe  over ther
e .   T h e mo me nt y o u  wal k
ed in you were free.  
It was like an island. 
So I spent most of the time th
ere in that hotel talking to 
pe ople and tra nsports l eave and 
Guzik sent  his wi fe a nd his da ug
hter .  So t his was t he best pr
oof and we spoke 
to Guzi k.  He  
says , " Y ou a sk me how i s it."  He sa ys, "I a m 
se nding my wi fe and my
 da ughter."  And it 's  
corre ctly, he did s end his wi fe 
and his daught er.  So we felt 
ma ybe it i s cha nce a nd fr om t h e  
undergr ound pape rs we 
kne w t hat s o met hing was  goi ng on t h at the Ger m ans ar e tryi ng to  
exc hange J e ws for tr uc ks.  We  di d not know
 exactly.  But t he undergr o und ne ver got a  
confirmation.  So as a result Vlad
ka di d not  want  have  
nothing to do wi th 
thi s.  Although she  
fel t  very ba d that  I ha ve t o le ave  and t hat 's...she
 started to spend the last
 days to be with me  
in           , she said, "I a m  not goi ng t o  l
eave .  I a m not going to l
eave because we don't know 
anyt hing a bout this .  We don't tr ust t h e Ger mans. 
 She didn't trust.  She 
didn't want to leave. 
And I  decide d si nce  I a m one  of 
five people of the fa mi ly, I will
 go and I will take a chance 
and see.  And the fir st tr
ansport left.  The second transport.  I was supposed to be in the third 
transport.  But when the thir
d transport left, it became rea
lly very...ever ybody could ha ve  
obtai ne d a  passport , not  for big mone y but eve n
 f or pea nuts .  You co
uld have ...i f you kne w 
anybody, you got a pass port.  I f you kne w anyb
ody wa s lea ving and you went int o the offi c e  
somehow everybody got a 
passport.  So that ca
me a little bit also suspicious to us . 
Why...why do you givi ng out so 
these passports so easily.  But 
in the day which I suppose to 
leave...uh...mine brother came  
the day before to say goodby
e to me.  But somehow, he 
turne d to be and he says, "List e
n, Be n."  Naturally, he did not 
t urn to me , "Liste n, Be n."  He 
spoke to me Yiddish or Polish.
  Uh..." You know I 
don't have s uch good fe ature s, Chr i s tian 
fe atur es li ke you.  You ar e ver y 
cl ose  wit h Vladka .  Here you ar e 
the      run.
  Why don't you 
give me the passport and I w
ill leave."  And the 
passport was with my
 picture with my  
na me .  It wasn't a pass port.  It was a..some 
doc u ment ation.  Not a r
eal pass port.  With a  
Para guaya n sta mp to t he Para guay
 to come to Para gua y.  A visi
t to Paraguay which was also

fi xed.  It wa s not a...not  a real visa.  And 
my brothe r turns to me I should gi ve hi m the  
trans port .  I did not t hink too much.  I pulle d out the pass port .  
 I gave hi m.  He e mbr a ced 
me.  He kissed me. 
 He says, "Promise me .  I...you'll neve
r forget.  The mi nu
te I will arrive I 
will let all of you know, and we
 will try to be reunited."  Th
e next day the 
Germans came 
with the trucks to ta
ke the people fo r the 
tra nsport a nd I overhea r
d...uh... a  conversa tion  
bet wee n the Ger ma ns ...a nd I re ma ine d ther e be
c a use it was sa fe plac e 
to remain because I 
wa s watchi ng alrea dy t w o transport l eavi ngs .  
Uh...I overhead that th
e Ger ma ns s a ys t o  one  
German to the other that he thinks that the Jews
 don't wa nt to l eave toda y.  I want ed...I t r ie d 
to go to the...when I hear
d this , I was trying to go to the door
...to open t he door.  I c oul dn't.  
The door...t he door wa
s already closed with a guard on th
e other side .  I had no chanc e  
to...t o leave.  So I wa
s...uh...my brot her alread
y was on the truck.  He le ft a l ready.  I did not 
have any communication anymore 
wit h my br other and I was st ar
ting to look for a hiding. 
And I found a hi ding on the...i
t was not the roof...below the 
roof there was a place where I  
thought that this was a proper hi
di ng.  Anyway, an hour later 
when I was in that hi ding, I  
already start  hea ring s hooting a nd sc rea ming.  
" Ra us!"-- " Out! Out!"   I  s ucce ede d t o be i n  
that hiding there was another pe
ople with a little boy.  Uh...I re
membered that..
.uh...that ma n 
who wa s hi ding wit h me we nt th

a fe w days before. 
 Why...I found out 
fr om this later...of ch

pulli ng up t he s ki n on his pe ni s, he shoul d like  
a Chri stia n boy.  And he was in ter r i ble pai n.  
He was in terrible pai

...but we  
laying in that hiding until th
e night...until it became very quiet. 
 Uh...My brother left before 
and that day and my na
me ...under my na me .  
I never hear d fr om hi m.
  I  ne ver kne w  where  
he we nt.  Pe ople  star ted t o tell  
me that the transport went to 
Berlin and fr om Berlin it went 
to...uh...by other trains, 
t hey went t o Ber ge n- Bels en.  All ki nd
s of stori es.  The true is tha t  
people went fr om that transpor
t t o Be rgen- B else n.  But I neve r hear d of my br other, ne ver

t me .  It was my brot her in my pla

for the first time  after 4 years 
when I introduced the Presiden
t of the United States before  
20,000 s urvi vors in t he United St at
es .  But I...t hose  thoughts of 
the carousel, of the crying of 
my father, of crying... mine co

lpless and cryi

crying ar ound the gra ves , and t hat shooti ng a nd 
t he...proba bly consta n

I a m even ver y c onte n

all of a sudden quiet down
?"  But when I quiet down it's th
e moment s whe n I re ally go bac k 
to the pa st.  You know 
peopl e tell me  that ...uh...I wa s res p

know, during the 
war , aft er t h e war here i n the Unit ed Stat es 
for 27 years...of creatin

probably the largest in the world beside            
     award.  But the         award, Temple of 
Manuel, and I will not fo rget when Rabbi Sobel 
one day turned to me. 
 We had a big sign  
which read:  WE  SHALL NEVE
R FORGET AND NEVER FORGIVE.
   And he in a very  
polite way turned to me one day 
in his office, he sa
ys, "Ben.  It's a sy
nagogue.  Our religion 
says that we should for gi ve.  
I know it's going to hu
rt you, but we cannot 
have a sign in this 
synagogue: WE  SHALL NE VER FORGIVE."  (Si

t he...maybe can live 
with the thought that we shall...w
e must forgi ve.  I don't  thi nk th
at...uh...for me 
to forgive is  
not to l ook for ve nge anc e for i f we woul d ha ve
 to forgive...not to fo
rgive...maybe we woul d 
have to imply vengeance.  But I 
don't think that I will 
be true to mi ne brother, to my fa mil y  
of 300 from before t he war, t o
 my collea gues t o our...t o whic
h I went to school, to my 

colleagues who later were the heroic fi ghters in 
the Wa rsaw ghetto, to

Naturally, I had to obey the rules of the Temple
 which allowed me to do
 thi s for a few years

Q:Ben, let's go over a couple 
of items that we haven'
t discussed before
.  Tell us a little bit about how 
you a nd Vla dka  got ma rr ie

A: We a r e bo th Je wis h, c o min g fr o m a Jewi sh b a c

Thi s we di d i mmediatel y at the fir st  week aft er liberati on upon the as sist ance , whic h is a  

story lat er, of my pare nts.  But a fte r th
e upr i sing, I could not sta y  anymore in the

t o Vla dk a .  Vl adk a  rent ed  an  
apartment on the corner of 
Gerboska and...uh...Valitsove, 
I think it's Gerboska and 
Valit sove.  Uh...She  ha d an a par

and I  us ed to c o me out fr o m

 dairy products for th

 Vl ad ka a nd wh en we  wer e

although in the beginning it 
was my fathe r 's  mo ne y whic

 we have money s o Vla dka us ed to

.  And my parent s uh..
.uh...got ...got use d

to her, and s he was  our a ngel .  On the ot her 
hand, Vladka, not having
 anybody of her own ,  
felt very comfortable with the 
feeli n gs that she comes i nto a 
room where people are caring  
for her .  This  went  down 
already for  a 
fe w we ek s. ..  
 
Q: Ho w ol d wa s Vla dk a  at thi s  ti me?  

 

A: Vladka wa s at this time ...uh...about 19...1
9, 20...and...maybe 19 ye
ars old.  An d...uh... 
Vladka...uh...uh...used to come  in quite ofte
n.  And when my pare
nts sa w t hat I a m  not  
coming at night , the y never as ke d me , " Where  were you? "   But they probabl y, a mong 

the mse lve s, t alke d.  But one day when Vla dka 
ca me to the hi di ng, my mother asked us both  
to come cl oser to her; and sh
e was wearing a ring. 
 She took off the ring fr om her finger and 
she sai d to me , " Put tha t  ring 
on Vla dka 's ha nd...fi nge r," whic
h I did.  And my mothe r  said, 
"Let it be wi th good l uc k ."  We di d not dis cus s 
it.  We did not  talk ab
out this.  But I kno w  
what my par ents wa nte d.  My pare nt s wa nte d at
 least to feel that 
they ar e  not letti ng her 
son...their son just go and liv
e with a girl without making 
a  ple dge  or a  vow, whi c h is 
traditional before marriage.  This
 is the ring which Vladka is
 still wearing t
oday.  She never 
cha nge d the ring.  What e ver it was le ft fr om 
my  mo ther which...memor
ies and...uh...maybe 
other  thi ngs, but  thi s i s t h e most preci ous  thi n

al most l ike an accept ance that 
when I come bac k, I  didn't ...I 
wa s.. .I wa s alre ady allo we d to

ver y close.  We never dis cus sed why s he wa s

 is ...uh...some thi

A: Ye s, we .. . ( sigh ) we we re y ou ng pe
ople.  It was...uh...we 
wer e  bot h very young. 
 We  were in love. 
I did not  know how to...uh...to 
e xp r e ss s o me mi n e  gratit ud e a
nd mi ne a ffe ction wi th s o me 
taking out her to theate r s or movie s, whic h I 
wa s brought up in a fa
mily whi c h was v e ry  
often goi ng t o theat ers, c onc erts , so I did not ha
ve any re creati o n.  So I deci ded that the best  
thing for me will be to buy a bi
cycle as a gift fo r her.  But,
 strangely enoug
h, when I bought 
the bi cycl e for her , she t old me t hat she doesn
't know t o ri de a bike.  I wa s sur e tha t  she  
knows how t o ride a bi ke .  And I bought it as a su
rprise .  And I felt that it 's  also ver y good  
for her to have a bike in the house that will gi
ve her a little bit more credibility for her by her 
neighbors t h at you know...her e sh
e's not ...uh...uh..
. reacti ng li ke just a girl whi ch i s afr aid. 
And I t ook her...t her e for e, when
 I found out t h at she does n'
t know how to ride a bike  
(chuckle ) one Sunday I took her in an open 
fiel d to te ach her how to ride a bike.  
Unfort una tel y, while tea c hing her 
how t o ride  a bike , s he fel l  
off the bi ke and sprained or  
broke the ankle.  We were real
l y in trouble.  She coul d no
t...the next da y she could not  
reveal to the...to the people 
of t he under ground caus e s he was.
..uh...in daily...uh...in daily 
contact with the people which 
a re he a ding the underground...u
h...s peci al ... uh... me cali  and 
others...uh...people with whom 
she  met  lunc hti me .  She couldn'
t tell them that she'd broke 
the le g by meeting...goi ng out t h
ere ...would ha ve bee n a c ri m
e.  So she came and she had  
eve n...s he could not  e ven reve al
 how she br oke  the leg, but  sh
e was wit h a cast  with a ban d  
aid which was done in a hospita
l in an emergency ro
om, and very little, very
 provisional, but 
that...t hose days we coul d never eve n  tell people
 s he broke the  leg beca use riding in a bi ke. 
" What you me an?   You in the under ground?   
You...you r i de a bike?  
 You...you'll goi ng to  
have...You...you are going out 
with a boy having a good ti me."
  Her whole credibility would  
be under question.  Th at me an
s that she 's not t he  onl y one 
who knows e v erythi ng.  M aybe 
she shares some infor mation w
ith me, which she didn't.  Very
 little Vladka ever told me 
what she was doing.  
And I was never pr essi ng her t o te
ll me.  So I really during th e 
undergr ound did not know e xact
l y what s he was doi ng.  But i t  wa s ver y e mbarra ssi ng, but  
it 's a coi nci dence which remai ns wi th us an
d...uh...but that
...t hose bikes are...were very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0152

helpful t o us  for t he...she  learned how t o ride
 the  bike  be caus e a fter t he Polish uprisi ng, we  
escaped due becaus
e from one place to the 
othe r  beca use we  kne w bot h how to ri de bike s,  
and we e sc ape d on t hose...on t hes e  bikes.   
So it wa s...uh...a  good

Q: Let me a s k you Ben.  The ...being i n love in t hi s
 peri od of ti me , be ing in 
love for a teenager for a 
young ma n i s the ha ppi e st ti me  i n hi s life .  Se
eing the worl d go up in s m oke is the most  
difficult thing you can imagine.  
How coul d you fe el both things?  
 

A: Uh...I would sa y that 's  very of
t en...she was cr yi ng.  Uh...Ma ny ti
mes we worke d toge ther.  M ost  
of the ti me wa s for me t o...t o relie ve her c aus
e when she  was wit h ot hers , she did not  r eveal  
anyt hing about  what  s h e lost...her  l one nes s
.  She was  cr ying.  
And I  was ma ybe a  good 
shoulder for  her , why s he wa s a b
le to cry.  This 
pr obabl y wa s al so pa rt of the  love, of 
expr essi on.  But I woul d..
.uh...I thi n k that ..
.uh...t 's a very i nt eresti ng que stion t o go bac k. 
Here we were two young people
.  Everything what we
 did was illegal.  Our whole existence 
was illegal.  The work which Vl adka was involve
d...later, I was involve
d in different work 
of the underground...was illegal.
  The people we...we met was ille
gal.  But something was in 
us...t he young...t he youth...t he
 young years , whic h proba bly you cannot suppres s this , and if 
you...uh...you ca
me  to expr essi on, probabl y our love
 was probably...I don't know...t o 
measure the dept hness, but was a true love.  
We did car e for each othe
r .  And I thi nk our  
love wa s probably....uh
...mostl y ba se d on r eall y c aring for 
ea c h other, a nd that 's why it wa s 
i mport ant for both of us .  It was not j ust a lo
ve of...uh...of an expr
essi on of se x, which wa s  
also, but was mor e the love of 
having each ot her , of being able
 t o depend on each ot her .  She  
knew t hat she can al ways count on
 me , and I kne w that I ca n al wa
ys c ount on her.  That  love  
wa s pr oba bl y more  tha n anyt hing el s e  a human 
being has .  Uh...Today
 when we live in an  
era, we know t hat t heir  love is probably expr
essed in the same way, 
but the...th
e attraction 
fr om...fr o m young pe opl e is pr oba bl y mainl y, fi rs
t of all , ba sed on s ex.  I don't e xcl ude

this...that this wa s not among 
us , but I think...I t hink it was 
mu ch deeper.  It was much  
deeper and mu ch more person
al affection and personal 
responsibility 
although we 
cannot ...we coul dn't do a nyt hing.  
Whenever  she wal ked out on th
e str eet or I walked out on 
the street, I never knew that I 
will come back and she never kn
ew that she come back, and  
she ha d many of mess ups.  She wa s a rreste d ma
ny ti mes .  I wa s arreste d and thank God that  
I was not br ought to...t
o the...t o the Ge stapo.  I wa s able 
t o buy myse l f out .  I wa s not s o  
much like ar rested that I was hara

for J e ws, a n d I was r ecogniz ed twice  and l uckil y 
that I was able to b

Polish people who knew me.  An

they paid fo r me the ransom, 
whic h I later on r et urne d beca use I di d not carry t he mo ney

wore some thing...ha d so

to ha ve it.  And...uh..
. t hat was ...uh...a cl ose r ela tion al
so.  Our close rela

that I was later on involved
... uh...in the unde

wa s...uh...br ought i n

And...uh...pe ople whic

Q:Let's talk a little bit th

 the ghetto uprising 
of 1943 and the Polish

A: Uh...That wa s for me , pers ona lly, 
a  period be tween 1943 a n d 1944, 
it 's al most a ye
a r...uh...or a  
little bit less than a year, but in 
these fe w months, they
 were so...I was so
 much involved in  
the work and living as a Chris
tia n that proba bly...that 's prob
ably account for most of my

livi ng in the Nazi era.  First , 
those years...t h e...I was abl e to 
wal k ar ound the streets of Warsaw
 be caus e I di d not ha ve the J ewi sh l ook.  The y sai d I had 
a good look because I looked like a Christian. Blue eyes, blond, and...uh...well dr essed. 

Dre sse d like ...uh...a toug

 parade in the city of Wa rsaw.  
And I must say t hat al

 I was afrai d for everybody. I also develope

It could have been even a tiger

uh...my parents had th

can push the m and...uh.
..when my mother pass ed by and my 
father, the goats used to really 
viole ntl y pus h t he m.  And t hey felt
 they knew that my mother or my sister or my father will 
not do anything to t he m.  At the sa me  ti me , i f 
I walked i n or the owner wal ked i n, the goat s  
wer e ver y, you know, watchi ng us and list eni

Q:Let's talk a little bit now about
 the uprising, the Wa rsaw upri
sing, not the ghe
tto uprising. 
 

A:(Sigh)  The Wa rsaw uprising. 
 Until the Wa rsaw uprising, it wa
s period of 1 y
ear.  We  were  
living...i n the Poli sh upri sing, we
 we r e living...uh...be fore the up
risi ng, as I said, Vla dka wa s 
living in Wa rsaw, and my parent
s a n d mysel f which I  us ed to
 come then t he cemeter y wa s 
in Praga.  Pr aga was liberated 
pr obably 3 days when the upri sin
g days started, 2 days or 3 
days a fter t h e upri sing st arted.  Uh...I  re me mb
er t hat we were infor m
e d by the under gr o und 
that we should await an upr
isi ng be caus e the Russia n Ar my was cl osi ng in on War s aw. 
Thi s wa s Se pte mber.  Uh...Septe mbe r ...Augus
t , Septe mber 1944.  So we...my pare nts ...the  
cemeter y were situat ed in a place bet ween t wo 
factories.           
                
          Street in 
Praga.  That 's where the cemet e
ry was.  So there was a talk
 t hat t he Ger mans before are 
leavi ng t his ...this ...cit y wi ll blow up al l the fact
orie s and all  the bridges .
  And I c a me bac k to  
my parent s a nd I tol d the m t his i s t he ne ws .  
Liste n, t he y ha ve two ch
oic es.  Eit her you can  
re main here.  I will go to whi ch of my prayer 
fat he r ...mot her asked, " Whe re  are you going t o  
be."  "I a m goi ng to the  city.  I a m goi ng to 
be with Vladka"  So you have two choices. 

Either you remaining here, or y
ou coming with me to 
the city.  I will fi nd 
a hiding.  And I...a 
day be fore t he uprisi ng...I br ou
ght t h e m....my fat her
, my  mot h er a nd my  
sister a nd another  
lady.  The Nova ks were 
already in a di fferent place.  The 
Novaks were al ready in the place  
where the little girl                had the gi
rl Meltzer we got to know 
them a little bit closer, and 
they took in the Novaks earlier 
to t heir  hidi ng in Pr aga .  And t h
ey remai ned in Pr aga.  When 
the upri sing starte d, 3 da ys la te
r the Russians walked...came into Praga and Praga wa s free.

 the  uprisi ng.  My par ent s wer e plac ed in a

there...uh...partially in hidi

But during the uprisi ng, we ha d a l ot of

wa s...uh...Ante k Cukier man went 
over the radi o and rec alle d al l  
the Jews to join the fighters. 
 And we joined the fi ghters. 
 But...uh...i n the  uprisi ng.

Je wish, most  of the  ti me  you  
had the possibility where that yo

first by them, alth
ough you were both 
with guns against the same 
enemy.  That uprising took 2 
mont hs .  Mysel f  havi ng i n  
mi nd...uh...al wa ys t o be  mi nde d of
 looki ng for a bunker 
of... During the da ys
 of the uprising, 
across the str eet where we we
re , Achi na, was a bombed out hou
se ...buildi n g, uh...which was  
a fact ory of...uh...phar ma ceutic al fac t ory,
 very well known,        .  In Poland, they called it 
.  This is more or less a comparitant, li
ke the aspiri n in the United States .  And I  
got ...uh...uh...ac quai nte
d with that caretaker from that
 bombed out buildi
ng a nd I agreed  
with him that we will st
art preparing in case th
e...the uprising comes to
 an end and it looked 
that we are goi ng t o los e bec a
use the Ger mans...the 
Russia ns  did not mo ve at all.  They  
stood on t he  othe r si de of t he Vis t ula  wit hou
t any fi ght against the 
Ger ma ns...uh...  The y  
would not move.  We  know today th
at this were also 
connected with political
 reasons.  The y  
did not wa nt  to gi ve t he Pol e s 
the opport unit y to say t hat t hey
 liberat ed Warsaw.  And they  
let the m just ...uh...die out.  A
nd I built that bunker which was.
..uh...the bombed
 out house . 
I found a pl ace t o cr awl  into 
that bunker  and t here was one 
place...a r oom where they had  

that...uh...uh...roo
f...uh...uh...not a roof, th
e ceiling was in th
e basement built round ceiling.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0152

They called it          the Klein way of build
ing.   Th at was holding,
 a nd I found a tr e mendous  
large room.  But the only 
thing is the room
 was empty because usually 
all the...uh.. rubbish, 
rubble was brought in to the hol
es, but this was about the only
 place , and I deci ded to build 
that bunker and for t he  2 mo nths duri ng th
e upris ing I kept buil di ng that bunker  and 
supplyi ng t h at bunker wi th batt erie
s with car batteries                  water and food and 
whate ver I  c oul d have , a nd I  decided to sta y in
 t hat bunke r.  But  wh
en I t ook Vla dka  one  
day when t h e bunker wa s complete

going to walk in and we're 
going to be...uh...w

She refused to go 
into the bunker.  
She  sai d I a m not goi ng to be coope d up thi s
 wa y.  I ...She re ally did not have...what coul d 
have happened the worst to her wa
s is if she would have to le
ave the city maybe she will be 
taken to a concentration camp, but.
..uh...not...uh
...   I was afraid that 
if I will get out and they 
will recognize me that 
I am Jewish, I will be
 taken to the...to th
e....uh...not to the 
concentr ation camp, but probabl y kill ed or shot
 or  taken t o a death ca mp.  Anywa y, I di d not  
leave .  I did not ...uh...I kne w t h
at Vl a dka  is not  agr

wa nte d to fi nd my pare nts .  I knew that  they 
are on t he...on the...on the  
ot her  party of t he city 
whi ch is ma ybe a 3 mile  walk or ...but to go th
rough the s ewer s and to 
pass the lines of the 
Ger ma ns , it wa s ver y da nger ous.  We found in 
t h ere a Polish officer w
ho said that he knows 
the way how to go through
, and he agreed for 4 bottles of 
whiskey that I...
he will take us 
through.  So we were t w o, a nd 
with us was a Christian boy wh
ich wa s very close with us , 
but very t all and we t ook hi m al

 started our walk through the

uh...we were crawling an
d cr awli ng at ar oun d 
2 o'c l oc k in the a fter noon, I as ked t h e other gu

me , " We are  at this a nd t his block."  I sa ys , 
"I f there i s s o ma ny hours  we  made t his  block, 
we needed 3 or 4 days until we 
reach it.  We  will never make 
it."  And I lo
oked around and  
ever ybody...we c oul dn't 
be mor e tha n 1 pers on i n front, 
but we onl y ca me to a pl ace where  
there was a connecti on whi ch you c an sta nd togeth

that young ma n had a gun.  I l ooke d  at Vla dka 
a nd I s aid, "Then, my

not goi ng further ."  And
...uh...I t ook over and I  said t o 
that  officer , " We are not going 
further," and the first ti
me I pulled the  gun and I s a ys, "I want
 you t o walk.  Yo
u go for w ard. 
We  are remaining here.  And I 
wa nna hear  your voic e, a nd i f  
I a m not going t o he ar your

agai nst one.  He had a bet t er gun that we have
, but  he had no c hoic e.  He ha d to walk a n d we  
returned .  And we returned...u
h...it was also in th
at...uh...fe w hours, th
ere were ma yb e the 
que stion of t hat young man...a wo
nderful fellow.  He 
was also left alone,
 a  Chri stia n boy,  
and he aske d me one thing, "Pl eas e.  Swear to 
me  that you wil l  never let me die here .  Take  
me  out outsi de a nd kill  me , but  
not in the...in the...in

are...we  have no chance, that
 maybe we wi ll...t he chances are 
mo stl y th at we 
will die.  But 
he did not want to die in that
 mud.  He was ready 
to be outside and k

mud and bur ied.  Ther e's somet hin

uh...nature tha t...it '

the privilege of dying co

ough he was Christian an

Yiddish and I am saying to him, "I am swea

I a m swearing to you that I w

      We were fortunate and we
 were able after a fe w hours to  
come bac k t o the plac e we c o

agine how you l ook whe n you 
come out fr om such a place fr om the...fro

said that if we will come

At least on the outside the

should have the shoe s.  And 
naturally when we came out fr om

dark at night.  We knew only 
one place where the fo rmer ghet

 And you cannot i ma gine, 
we wal ke d in those

Even in this terrible situation,

The y were wet .  In t he mi ddle

 Pr omise me when you

 but fortunate l y I did not have to bury her .  
But what wa s her wis h?   Onl y to be b uried as 
a huma n be ing!   Wel l , 
we were liberated in 
January 16, and the January 17, we ca me to Wars
aw, and t he first thing what I went ...I we nt  
to the place of that bunker and I saw the pl

me ans the peopl e are 
there .  And I  started t o di g.  I di d not know t hat 
t h ey were t her e and aliv
e, all of them.  When 
they heard me  di ggi ng, 
they thought that they
 were disc ove r e d.  Wh
ile  I  was digging di rt,  
they were  on the othe r s i de pu
tti ng more dirt , i n  e f fect , i n 
defending themselves and also 
deci ding if t hey're going to be reached, they w
ill  kill  the people who 
wil l  get  in.  But it  
beca me  dark at ni ght and I did not continue b
ecause the cit y was...wit h
out people .  I di d not 
conti nue di gging and I left and 
I went  someplace t o sl

en I came back in 
the morni ng, I heard t hat Jews sh
oot two Poles in the 
mi ddle  of the night. 
 They found the m 
and t he y took the m to t h e hospit al.  Uh...Fort u
nately, they were not d
ead.  They were just  
wounde d.  Cause  the y...a fte r  I le ft, r a n out fr om
 t hat bunker  a nd t he y went into the  se wer s  
for 3 days, and after the liberati
on for 3 days they still were in
 the sewers, no
t knowing that 
they wer e li berate d.  Three da ys lat er...I di d not  go anymor e for di ggi ng bec aus e I wa s  
scare d what I hear d.  I di d not 
continue.  Thr ee days lat er we 
found t he m alive on t he street . 
The y re cognized us.  Uh...This
 is one of the moments of an
 indi vidual .  Uh...The n I  and  
Vla dka le ft  Wa rsa w wi t h a not her couple ...uh.
..t ogether ....uh...t he 
boy wa s a Christi an boy 
and the girl wa s Je wis h.  And t he whole city 
has to be evacuated and we were brought to 
one poi nt.  For a fe w days
...uh....be fore we de ci ded t o leav

woma n.  And I wal ke d a r ound 3 days  dress ed 
as a woman and ever yb

encouraging me that I  looked go

didn't want t o be separate d beca use wi th Vla dka, I fel t  sa fer .  Pa rents I di d not have anymor e  

any contact  wit h them and I  walk

hi gh he els ,  white shoes ,  and

wit h a. .. wit h  a ma keu p o n my 
face , but I looked t errible .  Vl a dka use d to t ell me , " You look 
like a terrible prostitute."  The la
st day before I decide
d to walk out, I de
cided no.  
I took off 
all the cl ot hes of t he woman of
 the clothes and I put back 
my...my me n's dress suit or 
whatever I had, the shoes.  I says, "Whate
ver will happen will happ
en."  The only thing 
which happened, I had a little bit 
kinked hair.  And that was 
a weak point because...uh... 
usually Jewish people 
had kinked hair.  And I di
d not have the pos
sibilities in all this time to 
pres s the m.  So we deci ded t hat I a m goi ng 
to put a big ba nda ge on
 my hea d.  And I was  
wal king ar ound wi th a bandage . 
 Uh...t he bandage bec a me s o  di

"Why don't you go in to
 see a doct or because you're going t o
 get a n i n fecti on from the dirt .  
How c an you have a wounded head
 wit h suc h a dirty bandage? "  So we c an walke d out o f  
the cit y, somehow t he Ger man 
did not  stoppe d us, but t he Ge

hors es a nd wa gons , and the entir
e population to take t hos e who ar e wounded t o...bec a use  
they c oul dn't  walk the 20
 miles to Pruszkow to where the trai

others to this concentration 
camp.  One of t he Po

he sa w me wounde d..
.uh...a nd moti one d with hi s hand co

itler was thinking that he's 
saving a Polish patriot. 
An d...uh...this wa y we 
escaped.  Wh en the wh ole column  of
 the...of the...of the horse...the

and we r un and we ca me to Prus zkow to anothe

a ...uh...a  s mall...a be d, wit h 
a Polish wo man and husba nd.  I  
don't t hink t hat s he...t hat  they

whet her I do, the Ger ma ns e v ery ni ght use d to

his house  on this  3r d day to buil d
 a bunker i n t he fl oor .  And a
nyti me  we heard at night  that  
it 's going to be, you know, t her
e're going to look fo r the peop

should...we s hould both hide.  The woma n does

pus he d hi m i n that hole la ying but whi l e...whil e
 he wa s layi ng wit h me ther e for 1 ni ght , the  
second night , the thir d ni ght he says, "Cz esla w . 
 I a m not going to go i n.  I  a m not a Je w, I  
should be hi ding."  He di dn't 
turn...he  didn't think 
for a mi nute that I a m a J ew, but he di dn't 
wa nt to hide  hi msel f.  And t hat day in the mo

because I think he's
 getting a little bit nervous and there 
where the bicycle 
came handy.  We  
took...we had two bicycl

And t his was ...uh...we we nt in th

       , she said, "W

" Why.  What 's wr ong? "  She 
said, "This is the 
command...the command of the Ge rman 
Ar my."  And..
.uh...we had no choice .  " We have to 
go...you have to t ell 
them t hat you ar e 
here ."  I ha d no choice .  We
 took our t w o pa s s port s .  We  
walked into the commander 
together with her.  We told th

do, and...uh...we 
would li ke to r e mai n  here t o wor k 
and we wi ll accept an

to give to us."  And...uh...he 
looke d at our t wo pas s ports .  Uh.
..All the sta m ps were i n or der, 
and he accepted us to be there.  And I rented an
 apart ment, small bed, 
in a...in the place of 
the...one of the peasan

fe w mont hs.  It 
was the time of 
Chr i st ma s of 1944.  We wer e  
going ever y Sunday to t he chur

I n the Ger man command, the office

Nobody bot here d us.  We were  
only 15 or 20 mil es fr om t he 
Russia n fr ontier, and our  ai m 
was to wait until the...the water 
will fr eeze over and maybe we 
will cross the frontier.  But  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0152  
51 
 
we never started out.   Than
k God, because we woul
d not have had a chance to cr oss t he 
fr ontier.  Bu t...uh...we 
were...uh...these people were very si
mple, poor...si mple poor peopl e.  
They did not know who we  are.
  We hel pe d the m dre ss t he  Christ ma s t r ee.  We re ally 
brought in t he holi day t o the m, 
and they were l o oki ng 
up at us a s the pe
ople from the city 
who kne w how t o pre pa r e the tabl e and holida

Pole s  hated us.  Not  
because we wer e Jews....the p
easant s , because we wer e the pe
ople of the city.  And the 
people  that ...the  peasa nts  hat ed the  peopl e of 
t he  city.  As  a  res ult we  a l wa ys  got...I  go t  
always the worse work.  Any t y
pe of work which was nobody 
want ed t o do it was given to  
me.  Let's let the guy from the 
city do the job.  But I did not
...uh...mi nd as 
long as I can 
survi ve.  But why I want to br
ing out this and that 's al so something typical.  When the 

Ru ssians arrived on Janu
ary 16, we  were li ber a ted.   Uh...Eve rybody r un t o t his  st able  
beca use  it belonge d...a nd e ver ybody gra bbed 
a hors e, a cow, a nd a.
..t he li qui date d the  
wh ole...the wh ole...uh...farm 
whi c h wa s a  majo r  far m.   And  
everybody took
 a horse and 
brought t hem to this pl ace.  
And we di d not  thi nk about  it. 
 I t hink we we
nt t o see the 
comma nde r.  M ysel f , Vl adka a
nd that Krysia.  And t he comm
ander, I think, was Jewi sh. 
We walked in to him and we 
tol d hi m t hat we  would li ke  
hi m t o hel p us to l eave the  
town...the vi llage a nd t o go to t he cit y.  And I 
thi nk that he s h oul d hel p us and I ...we turned  
to hi m and we sa ys, "I t hink yo
u are Jewish."   When
 he  he ard this , he st ood up a nd he  got  
very a ngry.  " Who t old you that I a m  Jewi sh."
  I did not wa nt  to 
tell hi m you l ook like 10 
Jews, so "I have the feeling th
at you Jewish."  But 
he did not want to admit.  And he said, 
"Please do not show up anymore in this place.  
Go whe rever you wa nt."  He ...he didn't want  

to give us a ny hel p at all.  So we deci de
d to use agai n these bicycles and we went to 
Wa rsaw.  When we came to Wa rsaw and afte

disc ove ring my frie nds  i n that

Warsaw was completely empty. 
That 's a whole hist ory t o tell you how t hey s u

they were able to be in
 that bunker.  Every night they used
 to go out  fro m th

I 'll make s ur e to build a ...a marke r  for your fa

remembered the place.  And 
when we came to that cemete

300,000 gra ves , we sa w somethin
g whi ch is i m pos sibl e to under sta nd.  How c oul d people  
do i t ?  Ever y gr ave, al most ever y grave, was 
open.  Wh erever we ca
n look.  And t he hea ds  
wer e take n out and nobody even bothered to put 
back the heads to the 
gra v es.  This was  the  
wo rk of hoodlums . 
 
Q: The heads or  the headstones? 

 

A: Not...not the headstones.  The he
ads!  The headstones wer e standi
ng or broken, but t he he ads of  
the people of the skeletons were
 pul le d out i n or de r to pull  out 
t he teeth, the gol
d teet h of the  
people.  In those days
, people when they had problems
 with teeth, the 
fillings and the 
crowns were made out of gold.  So the 
hoodlums were lookin
g fo r the gold teeth  
and...uh...t ha t wa s done by t he 
local populati on.  Uh...I don'
t know exa ctl y who did it , but  
wh at we fou nd wh en we  ca me to t ha t  ce meter y 
i s ver y di ffic ult to forget and t o descr i be.  
That scenery of that cemetery with the open gr
aves  and it...a nd wit h the he a ds...t he s kele t ons  
of the heads outsi de the graves.  They didn't even 
bother to put it bother 
to put it back to the 
grave.  But           vis
ited two pl aces we vi sited afterward,
 but  it was t erribly col d.  It was 
January.  And i t was a cold wint er wit h snow
.  And we re al ly i n th
e big city of Warsaw, 
coul d not find eve n a bla nket t o cove r ours el f, 
so we wer e sleeping in our  coats, what ever  
we had.  So I kne w t hat I  left a bla nket, a bl an

whatever it i s in the pl ace where we 
were before in that        
   .  And I de c i ded sinc e ha ving 
the bicycle I will ride out over there to fi nd thatblanket to bring that blanket.  I arrived the 

2nd or 3rd day in           
    back and I ca me in t o  the

the door and locked it and 
he says to me he wants to talk to me.  I was a little 
bit...uh...sca r ed, but  I had to list e

 Oh he was very polite, nice, he says, "No, I 
don't think this wa y, but my neighbors think 
thi s wa y, and I  a m bei ng ha r asse d t hat I  wa s

I said, " Y ou don't have t o , but don't tel l me that

 I  took t he bla nket .  "I 'll se e you tomor r ow

and on the way I remembered 
thinking about this.  Here an

s ol d...my father didn't go out  
fr om t he house wher e t hey stayed, not my mo
ther, but my  sister th
e 9 year old was the 
ma na ger of t he fa mily going out to buy and e ver
yt hing and one  day she we nt to...uh... uh...t o 
the market and she saw 
a woman and she approach
ed that woman and says, "Listen.  I think  
you ar e Je wi sh.  That woma n was a li ttle bit        
    did not want to admit, but at the end, she  
saw a little girl, a 9 year old girl
...a little girl and she was very
 short and she says, "Yes."  
She  sa ys , "I  a m Je wi sh."  So t he l ady aske d 
her, "What...how 
can I tell you."  I says, "You 
can help me if you ca n get in
 t ouc h wit h the  underground a n
d found Vla dka wit h Cz esla w,  
and tell him that we are 
alive, that we are he
re i n Norpotchno.  Th
at took proba bly a mont h 
until the news reached 
us, because that woman did not ha
ve a direct contact with the  
undergr ound.  She had a cont act
 wit h some body who had a cont
act with another one whi ch 
had in the under ground. 
 Wh en it rea che d me the ne ws ...uh.
..t hat my fathe r  and mot her  are 
looking for me , t he  war broke out .  Whe n I  ca me... 
 

Q: The  what broke out?  

 

A: The...uh...not the war. 
 We were li berated.  We were l ibera

e Russians.  The  
Ru ssia ns c a me i n.  An d we wer e  fr

who met my  sister by coincidenc
e.  And she told me that, "Y
es.  I met your little sister."  
And s he de s c ribe d to me
 how she looks.  "And I reme mber
 he r bec aus e s h e was fr om Pa wia 
Street from t he same bl

house i s nea r a bi g...uh...ravine.
  I sa ys, " Nor port cho, a house  n
ear a ra vine.  Tha t  I..."   The  
next day I t o ld Vl adka, "I  a m going to Nor por
tcho.  There wa s no way of
 transport of public  
transportation.  I was hitchhiking
 on trucks, on military 
trucks.  Uh..
.I came to Norportcho . 
And I ca me to Nor port cho not 
havi ng no addres s a t  all, but 
I was looki ng for a hous e ne ar a  
ra...a l arge r avine.  And I ca
me acros s a... Nor por tcho; s  not 
s uch bi g town, a nd I found a  
house near  a  ravi ne.  I was dr ess ed i n a Poli sh 
soldiers uniform.  I wa
lked into that house 
and I as ke d i f i n t hat house...t he 
la dy whi ch opene d the 
door ...i f a fa mil y na me
d         lives 
here .  She s aid, " What? "  They had different 
na me s.  " We don't know anyt hing."  In the  
meanti me, I hear d the voi ce of my
 mother in the other room.  I 
pus he d that l ady in a side , and 
I knocke d...I  pus hed t he door and I 
ca me in.  An d  here my mo ther
, my father, and my si ster .  
I embraced them.  We cried.  We
 talked very little. 
 The only thing whic
h my mother kept 
whi l e k i ssi n g me kept  te ll me.  R e me mb er we 
are  Christia ns .  Don't sa y a n ythi ng.  Wh o we 
are.  Thi s was 3 t o 4 da ys a fte
r liberation.  They we
re afraid to admit that they ar e Jews 
beca use  the y  did not  know ma ybe the  fr onti er 
will  move  ba ck and fo
rt h.  Anywa y, I f ound 
the m.  The next day I brought 
my father back t o Warsaw.  
Two da ys la ter I brought  my  
mother  and my sist er and the 
lady which was with them toge
t her a nd I we nt int o War s aw 
and I  went t o the  hi ding place ...t he hous e wher e we
 use d t o hide t he   
  of Juliana Larige. 
That wa s not destroye d.  
I felt....I di d not see J uli ana Lari
age because she left wit h another 
group someplace t o Ger many.  But I  felt t hat th
i s  is place I can open 
the door and say that 
a m I sta yi ng here be caus e I kne w where it is.  Thi s wa
s              44, or 42 i n Warsa w .  And 
we ope ne d t he house the r e, a nd t his beca me  the  
first nuptials of the 
first J ews comi ng bac k  
to Wars aw.  And my mo
t her i m me dia t ely the fir st day...my 
fat her went out  
and he bought a  
sack of potatoes and th
ere was a big kettle
 where they used to bo
il laundry and my mother

use d to peel the potat oes all da y and c ook an
d e ve r ybody who wal ke d in j u st got the soup.  
The potato s oup, a plac e to war m
 up.  And I r e me mber
 t here t he first  week the people wer e 
sleepi ng on the fl oor s.  We  di d not  have be
ds .  Some  ma ybe a hundr
ed or more  pe ople ,  
whoe ver c a me t o t he cit y.  Late r on, the next
 bui lding, t he J e wis h c o
mmittee was created. 
Maybe...I don't know i f I  was coi nci dental or
 not, but the ne xt buil ding Targowa 40, t he  
Jewish Committ ee was created.  
And...uh... my father , I don't 
know, i m me diate l y went to  
Lublin...uh...whi ch was li berate d 
be fore and I was  not  with hi m, 
but I recall that
 he  tol d  me  
how he met  his brot her , his younge
st  brot her .  He  me t with hi m 
on t he str eet in...in Lublin. 
The y just c a me ac ros s ea ch other on t he street .  They e mbrac e d, but for an hour they cr ied 

toget her .  None of t he m aske d who™s  alive.  M y
 uncle later told me th
at ...uh...t he story how 
he met wit h  my fat her .  That he s ays, "Don
't you ask me who™s alive?"  He says, "Why 
should I as k you.  I t hink ever ybody i s dea d."  
So he tol d hi m, "My wi fe is alive ."  And he  

told hi m, "My wi fe is alive."  They were even
 afraid to tell if so
me body is alive and ask 
about a nybody el se .  Naturall y, in 2 or 3 days
 later, my father came back to Wa rsaw 
and...uh...immediately 
got...e ngage d hi msel f in t he public
 work and t hen maki ng a li ving,  
buying, sell i ng, whate ver  he did 
a nd t hat 's...  A week later my
 uncle ca me to me and s a ys, 
"List en.  I want you t o do me
 a favor.  You are with Vladka
.  We  know ever ythi ng.  But  
father insists on  the Huppah. 
 And I spoke with Vladka, and 
she sai d, " Why not? "   I  t hink 
that was 10 days after li berati on or 8 days in
 that room whe r e we were hidi ng, we had a 
million of people.  I think it was 
the first Huppah in 
Warsaw after the war.
  I am trying to 
tell you things of personal interest, but at the 
sa me ti me I a m avoi ding
 to tell you things o f 
our invol ve me nt in the type s of ha ppeni ngs of 
others.  I spent a life with Vladka together 
in...a s a Chri stian boy....i nvolve d, e ndangering 
li fe , ne ver thi nking that we are endanger ing  
in wo rk with others.  
There were many people
 i n t he under ground. 
 The majority of the  
people in t h e under gr ound wh
ic h d i d th e wo rk wh at we  we
re doing is sometimes maybe 
much more heroi c of what I ha
ve to tell you, di d not sur vive .   They pe ris hed, not onl y by 

being Je ws , but by hel pi ng ot hers t o  survi ve.  
I don't know i f hi stor y wil l  do just ice , that

those couriers, those young fighters will be re
membered.  Peopl
e usually talk 
of those who 
survi ve d, but  our sur viva l  was not buil t  because we  were s mart e r.  Our s urvi val was not built  
that we wer e  more  ca pa ble.  Ever ythi ng what  ha
ppened to us was j ust 
coi ncidental .  It  was 
sheer luck, someti
me s more than your 
own intuition.  It wa
s sheer luck of s
ituati on s  we  we nt  
through.  But I woul
d like to leave a l egacy i s to leave a 
legacy of those who 
did not survive.  
The y ar e al wa ys forgott en.  
There a r e many pe ople alive t o day which s urvi ved bec ause  
other s car ed for the m, a nd mai nly t he ot her s 
were the  Je wi sh boys and Je wish girl s...the  
maj orit y of the m did not  make it.  And I hope
...we don't even have th
e pictures of all  of  
these pe ople .   We did not eve n 
ha ve the recor ds .  We don't ha
ve the r ecords of
 even...I know  
that in the              and Dick and Sylvia and others, were trying to put together the names of 
thos e who were i nvolve d , of th
ose  who fi ght...fought
, of those  who di d 
not think about the 
dangers t he y  are gotte n i nvolve d, but  even t his 
is not completed.  We 
don't remember all the 
na mes .  So t he museum whi c h i s bei ng built , 
I hope will , thr ough s o
me wa y, fi nd a wa y o f  
re me mbering the ...those . ..t he unknown na me s,
 t he unknown me mbers of  the under gr ound, 
the unknown young pe opl e who 
paid the...with thei r lives to help others.   
 

Q:Okay.  Let's go back 
a little bit.  This was very important 
and very, very signi
fi cant, moving.  
Let's go back a little bit and touch on a couple of
 things.  Ben, the on
e thing you didn't give  
us at al l is what li fe was l i
ke i n t he  ghetto whe n you wer e 
i n t he  ghetto wa y bac k when. 
 

A: Mic hael , you are wit h me 10 ye ars.  In the 10 
ye ars , I told you ma ny stories .  I was tryi ng 
through you to bring b
a c k and you kne w...you he ard a lot , but  it's i mpossi ble to spe ak a bout 
ever ythi ng a nd much more di ffi cu
lt i s  to descri be ever ythi ng.  
There ar e scenes which are in  
my  mi nd  wh ich I  a m n ot ab
le to describe.  I am 
too poor wit h my la ngua
ge  to be  able t o d o  
it, but  I wa s t r ying.  You a sk me  
about the life in
 t he  ghetto.   
 

Q:I n t he Wa rsa w ghet t o. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0152  
59 
 
 
A: In the Warsaw Gh
etto.  The Warsaw gh
etto is only a symb
ol .  There  wer e ot her ghett os a nd there  
people wer e sacri fic ing li ves i n ot her ghett os 
t oo.  Ther e were concen
tration camp.  But the 
Wa rsaw ghetto will be
 remembered for many 
reasons because Warsaw
 represents like the 
symbols for other s.  Wa r sa w, I th
ink, toda y li fe , e speci ally Je wi
s h li fe , is very organiz ed.  I  
wis h it coul d have bee n orga nize d li ke this the years whe n we were t here .   The war woul d 

be di ffere nt.  Jewi sh li fe  was organi zed t o su
ch an extent t h at ev
er y house ha d their own 
committee.  And we cared for eac
h other.  We  had no means,
 but we shared.  We  were 
living under  const ant te rror and more...more 
i m porta nt, we wer e livi ng under const ant  
fe eling of hunger and helples s
ness .  We were li ving in a 
world abandoned by the entire  
world, by ne ighbors .  
We  could have  l ooked int o t he wi
ndows of our  nei g
hbors  through the  
wall and our neighbors could ha
ve looked into the gh
etto.  But...uh...the
re was very little 
reacti on.  What was the ai m of 
t he cr eation of t he ghett o.  Toda
y, I star t to underst and t his.  I  
did not  understa nd t his  in t hose years.  Th
e other  was  t he c oncen
tration, a gathering 
of...i ngat heri ng of t he vic t i ms under t he c onditi on
s of making them...uh.
..impossible to live ,  
deprived of everything.  Everyt
hing what we did in the ghetto was illega
l.  Eating bread, 
which was rationed, was illegal. 
 Beside breathing, if
 you could, everythi
ng was illegal. 
Schools we re closed.  Ch ildre
n lost their parents.           
     around the gh
ett o  hungry wit h out 
any shelt ers, dirty.  We were suffering of t hat
 dirt.  Eve r yt hing wa s 
lice wer e crawling about  
people on the stre et.  You c oul
d have se en not ...not wi th t h
e  na ked e ye.  You coul d hav e  
seen more l ice on the people 
tha n  you could have s een t he 
clawing.  All this was in 
preparati on t o gi ve  us  a slow d
eath.  But this was no
t e nough...not at fi
r s t enough.  But in 
spike of ever ythi ng, we beha ved mor e  humane 
tha n anybody c oul d have even thought a bout  

this.  We  had culture ev
e nts by the  hundre ds  and t housa nds  
in thos e days.  Eac h house had a  
cultur e dir ec t or, not direc t or, a cult ure  pers on i n
 c harge.  Whe n we ha d 
to stay i ndoor s, we  
had e very ni ght pr epar ed a diffe r ent l ecture .  
Some of t he m from well pre pa r ed speakers , but  
most of t he m by young people .  
So t his wa s not a  life, you know , of all o wing t o ours el f j ust

to disi nte grat e or to be br ought down to the .
..to the way the Germans 
wa nte d us .  But it wa s  
done wit h c alculat ion.  Today we know t he  
way we were t reated 
in the Warsaw ghetto, 
people were  treated not a ghett o, t he r e wa s a pa
tt ern.  Not hi n g wa s done in the ghett o s by  
just by the will of the comm
a nde r whi c h ca me .  He  ca me  
wit h a te xt  book a nd wit h 
instr uctions how t o cr eat
e Judenrat , how to creat e ghett o, how
 t o cre ate t he r ationi ng, how t o  
create the labor camps.  
Eve r yt hing wa s well     .  So wh
en we speak about 
the ghettos, we 
should also remember the wa
y the people, not only militar
ily opposed them, which is 
important, but the spiritual resistance
.  In my buil ding wa s the       
        Rabbi , a ver y, ver y  
lone Rabbi.  He was in hi
ding.  And I wa
s given the responsibi
lity, because I was the 
secret ary of t he house committ ee to
 ma ke sure that nobody knows 
that he lives there, but to 
ma ke sur e  that food i s be ing de
li vere d to hi m.  But he has hi
s  disci pli nes , ev
en with those  
terrible sit uations, I cannot forget
 they used to come.  And fr om
 t heir por tions  of brea d t o 
bring the br ead for the Ra bbi .  That  the Rabbi 
s hould be not  hungry.  The devoti on t o the  
Ra bbi .  He peris he d late r in a conce ntrati on 
ca mp.  Now...uh...from the point of vi e w  of 
getting information.
