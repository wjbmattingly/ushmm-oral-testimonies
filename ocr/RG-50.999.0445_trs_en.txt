introduction.  
 
 
W ebegin with this portrait of  Manny Mandel. Manny was born toa 
religious Jewish f am ily on May 8, 1936, in Riga, Latvia.  Manny was just 3 

whenW orldW ar II started. T hough he was born in Riga, Latvia, Manny's 
fam ily were Hungarian Jews.  T hey moved brief ly to Latvia becauseof  his 
father's work.  Here we  see a portrait of Manny's parents, Yehuda Mandel, 
holding their inf ant son Manny.
  
 
 
Shortly af ter Manny's birth, hisf atheraccepted apostas a chief cantor 
in Budapest andthef am ily returned to Hungary, where they had lived before 
1933.  Hungary is highlighted on thism ap of Europe.  Budapest ishighlighted 
on this mapof  Hungary. 
  
 
Manny's father was based at the renowned Rom bachSynagogue.  In 
this picture, we see Manny andhisf atherona street in Budapest.  
 
 
T he Hungarian governm ent passed anti
-
Jewi sh laws beginning in 
1938.  In 1940, Hungary joined the Axis Alliance, and in 1941 Hungarian 

troopsparticipatedalongside Germantroopsin the invasion of the Soviet 
Union. The war and increasing restrictionsmade lifef or juice in Hungar y 
increasingly diff icult. The photo on the left shows Manny outsidehis 
apartm ent on hisf irstday of  school in 1942 in Budapest.  On the right we see 
a contem porary photoof Manny standing outside the sam e apartment.

Negotiationsfor their transport toPalestinebroke down and in 
December of 1944, about six m onthsbefore the endof  the war, Manny and 
his m other were released f rom  Bergen

they stayed at the Heiden Children's Hom e, 
which is pictured here,where Ella worked asa teacher. Manny is l yi ng down

Af ter the war, Manny and hism other reunitedwith his f ather in Israel.  
T hey subsequently emigrated to the United Statesand lived in Philadelphia.  
Manny is a graduate of Temple University and did his graduate work at the 
Universit y of  Pennsylvania. He is a clinical social worker.  He met his future 
wif e, Adrienne, in Philadelphia and they were m arried in 1958. T hey have 
been marriedfor 55 years.

Manny, thank you
 
som uch. T hank you som uch for joining us,for your 
wi llingness to beour 
Firs t  P e rs o n
 
today. W ehave a great deal for you to 
cover in just an hour.  W e'll just jum p right in.  You were born in Riga, Latvia, 
in 1936,but your fam ily stayed and certain yours was a short one bef ore you 
m oved to Budapest, Hungary. W ar began inEurope with the invasion of 
Poland by the Germ ans in 1939, Septem ber1, when you were 3. Bef ore we 
turn to the war years, tell us what you can about yourf am ily, their life, in your
 
ver y early l if e bef ore the war began.  
 
>> Manny Mandel: W ell, are we on?  Yes. People often askm ehow com e I 
was born in Riga when m y fam ily is ethnically Hungarian.  I usually r espond 
by saying there's a rule that says you must be born where your m other is.  
 
[Laughter]
 
And interestingly enough, part of the reasonwe were in Riga had som ething 
to do tangentially with the later
-
on Holocaust issues. Bill mentionedthat 
s o m e of t h e e nf o r cem en t  of  t he  an t i
-
Jewish, anti
-
Sem itic laws in Hungar y 
was in 1938, but som ething called the Numerus Clausus, which wer e the 
anti
-
Jewish laws in Hungary, began in the 1920's, about 10 years bef ore the 
Germ ans startedthe Nuremberg Laws in 1933.  
 
 
As a consequence, because of  thenature ofEurope, let me tell you 
wh a t th
at was.  My father is f rom  eastern Hungar y, born inthe 
A u s t ro
-
Hungarianempire's days in 1904. W hen he was 18 years old, he was

draf ted into the Czech Arm y, becauseaf terthe FirstW orldW ar, thisis 1922, 
Czechoslovakia hadbeen created.  For those of  you who rem em ber, it was 
created af ter the First W orldW ar. Som y father's now in the Czech Arm y, 
he's a Czech citizen.  
 
 
As a Czech citizen, when hef inishedhis training in Vienna in 1927or 
so, he was lookingf or a job in Hungary.  They would not give 
him  papers.  
First, he was a Czechcitizen and a Jew.  The laws that were enforcedm ade 
him  unable to get a position thathe wanted in continental Hungary.  
 
 
He dida number of investigations as to where to go andfounda job, 
which was ver y m uch in demand, it was in Riga. W ent there in 1933.  In 

1936 I was born.  By that time,he was able to get the papers requiredf or him 
to go to Hungary and he goes to Hungary in 1936, has a job in the Rom bach 
Synagogue that Bill mentionedand he thinks hehas just reached heaven on 
earth,because it's the job thathe wanted and theplace that he wanted, 
ethnically Hungarian.  
 
 
If notf orthef ellow with  the little mustache, you remember him ,he 
would have been there, I would never have com e here to talk to you in 
F i rs

. T hat's how we wind up in Riga.

the lines of som eone saying, well, today you now speak Yugoslavian.

the Austro

Hungary em pire, which was choppedupaf ter the war.  Southern 
Hungary, better known as Yugoslavia, todayknown as Serbia.  Illustration, 

her hometown is Novi
 
Sad. Itdoesn'tm atter.  My m othertold the story af ter 
t h e  F i r s t  W or l d  War  end e
d, Yugoslavia is created in 1918,  she's 10 years 
old, they come into school, they say OK, tom orrow, we're going to change 
language. T hey'd been studying Hungarian.  The language to be changed to 
was Serbo
-
Croatian. T hese two languagesdon'thave a sylla
ble, period or 
comm athat are sim ilar. T hey were bilingual.  The kids saidf ine.T he point is 

this was notunusual in Europe.  My father, through his career, probably was 
conversant inprobably eight languages. Hewas not a linguist. But you 
heard som e
 
here, some there, some som eplace else, and you usedthese.  
 
Part of the reasonm y m other, you saw the picture in Heiden, 
the children's camp, after we were taken outof  Germ any on thisbarter basis, 
20 Hungarian kids were sent to this children's hom e in Heiden, in the Germ an 
part of Switzerland.  They wanted to send som ebody along who could speak 
for the kids andto theotherpeople in the place. T he otherpeople included 
thedirector, who is on thepicture,they were all German or French speaking.  
M y m
other had very go od Germ an. And acceptable French.  From  school. 
Shehad beena schoolteacher before she was m arried.  She was the likely 

choice. As a consequence, here she is, speaks Hungariantous, Germ an

and Frenchto the rest of the people, and in Europethis was as routine as

>> Bill Benson:  You lived in Hungary, and war began in September 1939, 

but the
 
full effect would not come to your comm unity until 1944. Yet, there 
were m any diff icult times in those intervening years.  Before we m ove tothat 

period,once it really hit hom eto you in 1944,tell us what lif e was like once 
the war began in Europe for you and yourf am ily li ving in Budapest.  
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Life form eas a child was f ine. For two reasons. 
 
You 
need to know, those who have studied anything about the Holocaust, have 

gone through thism useum, the experience of Hungary was unique. Because 
asidef rom Italy, and of course Japan,aboutwhich we're not speaking, that's 
a differentpartof  the world, Hungary was an ally.  As a consequence the 
im pact of the Germ anoccupation, the impact of  theSS,of  all things German, 
did not happen in Hungar y.  Hungary was ruled by a regionand apolitical 
party called the Arrow Cross, which was the Hungarian equivalentof  the Nazi 
party.  Butona day
-
to
-
day basis, people went to work, came homef rom  
work, went to them ovies, andpeople ate lunch.  
 
 
W hat I'm  saying, in many ways, until alm ost 1944, the impacton 
Hungary is alm ost unf elt.  W ell, not quite.W e want

western allies, on the other side the Russians.  They're bom bing Budapest, 
because it is
 
anenem y capital. W ell, people living in Budapest, Jews, 
non
-
Jews, anybody else, were aff ected by this bom bing. Budapestwas not 
quite destroyedasm uch asW arsaw was or Ham burg or Dresdenwas.  It 
was a signif icant im pact.  Other than that,m uch of the
 
im pa ctd id  not affe ct 
the child.  
 
 
W ell, Itake that back.  I went tof irst grade, you don't see inthe 
picture, I went tof irst grade with a star onm y coat. Jews hadto wear a 

yello w star.  Those of  you who have gone through the museum or wil l do so 
w
i ll see samplesof  these stars. In certainplaces they're being displayed, 
pictures andactually actual stars. T he star that I saved until af ter the war 

was lost when we came to this country, unfortunately, for reasons that are 
totally unrelated.W e cam e here by plane, not ship, in 1949.  On theplane, 
you can only carr y ver y f ew things.  I left thatstar and som e other important 
papers of m ine with an aunt in then
-
Israel, who was going to ship it to us 
af terwards.  She changed houses. My im portantpapers and star 

disappeared.  I neverforgave m yself , but that's lif e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You described in som e ways , as a very young child, the 

wearing of  the star, it m ade youfeel the same as theadults, because they 
hadto wear the stars.  So it hada diff
erent impact on you f rom  that 
perspective.  Can yousay more about that?

>> Manny Mandel:  I thought thatbeing 6 years old,7 years old witha star, 
exactly as Bill says, m adem e an adult,and thatm adem e very pro ud. Let 
m etell you very brief ly at th
is point I began to realize m aybe this is nothing to 
be proudof .T he rulewas that you had to wear that staron your outer 
garm ent, outsideof  the house. If  you didn't,the consequence was being 
shot.T hat's all.  On the spot or somewhere else.  Very s
im p le.   
 
 
T he rules were simple.  As long as you lived within those rules, there 
was no problem . I thought that was great.  Until I was about7 or so, I said to 
m y f ather, I outgrew m y tricycle.  I'd like tohave a bicycle.  A small
-
s i ze  
bicycle.  T o whic
h m y father said f ine, no problem  getting the bicycle, except 
two reasons,m inorand a m ajor, which wi ll pr event mef rom  gettingyou a 
bicycle.  T hem inor was we li ve on thef if thf loor of  theapartm ent.W e had an 
elevator. T he elevator was a 50

elevator.  Frequently was out of 
service.  T he parts to repair the elevator were m ade in the sam efactory that 

was m aking m unitions, guns and things.  Elevator parts were ver y low on the 
priority f or mechanical kind of engineering.  
 
 
So the elevator is one. My f ather saidI have to trek thebicycle 
down
 
--
 
in Europe youdidn't ride the bicycle in your backyard.  Nobody had 
backyards.  Go tothestreet,to thepark, youride the bicycle, comeback.  I'm  

wi lling to do that. That's ver y sm all.  
 
 
T he  l a r ge
r issue is if  you ridethe bike in thepark with the yellow star

and you'reout of m y sight for 12 seconds, som ebody m ight decide to hit you 
on thehead and takethe bike or hit you on the headand leave the bike, as 
long as they can hit you, because that yellow star is am agnet of certain 
behaviors.  T hat I'm not will ing to risk.  
 
 
I was ver y upset. T heyellow star cost me abike.  At 7 I had a diff icult 
tim eputting those two things together.  I cantell you
 
in 1949, when Iwas 13, 
we li ved in New
 
Yo r k .
  
Not thef irst day we arr ived, but within a very short 
tim e,m y parents said this af ternoon we're going to the store. W hatare we 

going to buy?  Abicycl e.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwere som e of the other restrictions that were im posed 

on Jews at that time?  
 
>> Manny Mandel:  Several.  One day them an com es to thedoor, says we 

m usttake your telephone.  There'snothing anti

S e m i t i c  ab ou t  ph ones . T h at  
was a restriction.

theother stuff, exceptthey were called am aid.  
 
 
My m other and them aid were thedishwasher, the dryer, the washer, 
theother things. This was routine ina m iddle classf am ily.  Had nothing t
o 
do with being aristocratic. T he maid was m y buddy, a young wom anf rom  the 

hinterlands.  Closer to m e in age. 18, I was 6, 7,8. That was m y buddy.  In

thedaytim e, when I was in school, she was hom e.  
 
 
T hey told usthat themaid had to go. W hy?  Jews could not have 
m aids.  You survi ved these things som ehow.  My m other didm ore work.  I 
don't know how shemanaged it, but there were three of us.  Much of the time 
only two of us, because one of the consequences of being under this kind of 
rule was som ething called the slave labor cam ps.T his is not whatyou see 
upstairs inthe museum  about being taken awa y into camps. TheHungarian 
m alepopulation was conscripted into the army.  It was called the draf t.  In 
this room , I don't see too many people who would know anything about the 
draf t, which in this country was elim inated som etim e ago.  
 
 
T he point still rem ainsthatthe draf t tookm en into thearm y.  
Hungarian m ilitary forcesf ought in Russia wit h the Germ ans. T o replace 
these Hungarian m en with labo
r, they conscripted battalions of  Hungarian 
Jews, m y f ather being oneof  them . In19 whatever, 1940,he was 36 years 
old, a young m an, strong as an ox.  He andall of his colleagues and doctors, 
lawyers, Indian chief swho had absolutely noknowledge of  physical labor 
were conscripted to do m ining, road repair, crater repair.  My f atherwould get 
a phone call, letter,or visit that would say onT uesday at3:00 you are to 
appear at this train station.  You will be gonefor a day, two, f ive,

he wasn't home.  It was routine f or not being there.  The fact that he wasn't 
therem eant I grew up for those three years without afather.  
 
 
It alsom eant m y mother's work was less, because she was only taking 
care of herself andm e.  Them aid was gone. My f ather wasn'thom e.  My 
father's youngest brother, who was nam ed David, af ter whom  we nam ed our 
son, David, he was
 
a universit y student.  Restrictions?  He was the last 
graduateat theuniversity in Budapest with a star onhis chest. W hen he was 

called into these laborcam ps af ter hef inished school in 1943, he threw a f it. 
My grandm other, whowas visiting, f ainted.
  
It was unusualfor David to go 
into the labor cam p.  But m y f ather, routine. T hey were 10 years apart in 

age.  So m yf ather was 36, he was maybe 26.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Manny, you alsom entionedthatthere is the larger context of 
the war going on, so there was bombings and other deprivations. W hat was 
your f ood situation? 
 
>> Manny Mandel:  If you recall thepicturesat the very beginning, m y f ather 

is in the bigf urry coat with the hat.  Com ing hom ef rom  them arket.  
Obviously, it was home at the time
.  
 
 
I have absolutely no recollectionof food being a problem  in any 
fashion, butperhaps there was som e rationing.  My wif e, who gre w up

She loves it whenI say it.  My wif e tells me that during the war, we'r e the 
sam e age, there were rationing, certain things here,butter was restricted, 
gasoline was restricted.  I don't think that we experienced restrictions in 
Budapest atthe time that were any more severe than those restrictions.  
 
 
I have no 
recollection of f ood being a problem .  Although, it's 
interesting to me that m y grandparents, wholived in Novi
 
Sad, had a 
backyard where they lived, and they began to raise a couple of chickens and 

a rooster. T hey were notfarmers, but therewas som e lan
d, all f enced

in  
area. I rem em ber they eitherbroughtor senta bird.  Maybef or holiday tim e.  

It isn'tbecause we wer e starving, but there was perhaps somem ore difficult 
tim e. Af ter all, the war is going on.  Everybody has a little less of all the goo
d 
things.  Basically, f oodwas not aproblem ,asI can recall it at that tim e.

In the FirstW orldW ar, for those who know, them ap of Europe, you 
think about the Adriatic Sea, think about the top of the Adriatic, where Italy 

and Yugoslavia connect, which had beendisputed territory and to s
o m e

W ar took place there,andthat's where Horty earned his spurs andwas a

He m akes a pact with Hitler to become an ally.  T hat pact continues.

He and another man,who had essentially trainedand lived inGermany by

Ladies and gentlem en, you don't dem andto see Adoph Eichmann.  
You beg and cajole, but that's not what they did. T hank Godthey did that, 
because the kind of arrogance,the kindof  gall it tookfor them  to do tha
t  is  
alm ost more diff icult to im agine than it is,butthey felt thatthe only way they 
could getthrough, andEichmann to some degree because of som e curiosity, 
"W ho are these idiots?"  W as willing to see them .  In the beginning 
discussions they com e up with a plan.  IfEichm ann releasesam illion Jews 
f rom his holding, they will procuref or him  10,000trucks laden with m ateriel 
andm aterial to be used in the Eastern Front. 
 
Folks, if you know what a $3 bill is, I justdescribed one. Again, 
Eichmann did n
othave thepeople to release,even if he had the authority.  
T hesefolks didn't have a spare tire, let alone10,000trucks.  However, 
Kostner stays tonegotiate with Eichm ann. Brand isdispatched to speak to 
theallies in Egypt, The British allies particularly, to secure10,000 trucks. 
  
I don't want to tell you how absurd that is, but pretty absurd.   
Brand isarrested in Syria, spends the rest of the war in Egypt, in Cairo, in 
jail.  Survives the war.

back to the census.  Ever y m orning we're told atdawn there will be a 
counting of  the people.  They didn't tell us when. W e were told to
 
be out at 
dawn, which we did.  For some tim e. I can't give you specif ic periodof  time, 

rain, snow, whatever, out there.  Until oneof theoff icers said this is 
ridiculous.  He said, I'm  going tobehere, let's say, 8:00 precisely. The 
precision was guaranteed.  Idon't care if you come out at 4:00 in the morning 
or 7:30, butbehere at 8:00.  It saved a lotof grief .  It took up, inthe earlier 
part, several hours of the day.  
 
T he otherpart was time spentattem pting tom ake som ething of  
the food that

Because we went onthis so

calledtrip toa port, we were told topack some 
food.  Miraculously, these foods lastedm uch longer than it wouldhave lasted 
anyplace else.  I assure you there was nota crum bthat was notused.  
 
 
So we're involved in that.  Third thing thathappened in cam p, alm ost

spent several weeks eating potatoes.Although

Hungary itself . W e knew where he was when we left.  He knew we  were 

leaving.  He didn't know what would happento us, we didn't know what would 
happen to him .  
 
 
Shortly af ter we lef t, this is towards theend of 1944,he was taken out 
of  territorial Hungary with his groupand began todo sim ilar work, 

fortif ications, whatnot, in the Ukraine.

whose nam e youdon't rem em ber, perhaps, but you do rem em berhis words.  
How m any recall George Santayana? He said thoseof  us who donot learn 
our history well m ay live to repeat parts of it. I'm  not suggesting that this is 
an announcement of the forthcom ing of  another Holocaust
,  bu t  m any 
elementsof history are thereand our task isto learn it well.  It can help us in 

thepresent.  It can help us in thef uture. And I pose thatas a challenge to 
you.  Thanks a lot.  
 
[Applause]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Manny, you can stay behindfor afew m inutes.  If anybody 
would like to talk with Manny.  He went too long to have a questionperiod. If  
you would like to aska question, he will be on the side. Ask away.  If you 
want a picture taken too, that's all right too, right?  OK. T hank you.
