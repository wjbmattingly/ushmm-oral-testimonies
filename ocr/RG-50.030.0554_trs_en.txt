A: Well, I was a second grandchild of to
 Œ tw o large families. I mean, large Œ 
relatively large. There were four Œ four Œ 
four persons on each side. My father and 
two sisters and a Œ an d a brother. And a 
widow grandma. And o Œ on my  mo ther™s

years older than me, she born in 1933. An
d between us was another girl which Œ 
who bu Œ who passed away at the age of 
a year and a half. So I Œ I didn™t learn 
about her much, okay, 
that™s Œ and so, was a Œ was a 
big happiness, you know, first 
boy in the two families, but don™t ask me what for.

A: Pardon me? 
Q: What did your parents do fo r a living? 

A: Well, my mother, she Œ her trade was to
 make ladies™ hats. And she had her Œ th 
Œ I think wa Œ the most select clientele in 
Warsaw,
 including the Œ th e wife of the 
prime minister and people like this. She was very well known, which was wo rking 

against her during th at period of Nazis,
 and you know the 
persecution, so, you 
know, it™s good on one side, and depends 
wh at the times, can be working ag ainst. 
Q: And what did your 
father do for a living? 
A: He wa Œ he Œ he Œ he was a Œ a furrier, 
he cut furs. And he ha
s a small store. That 
was what he was doing for a living. 

Q: Mm-hm. And was your family very religious? 
A: No. 

Q: No? 

A: My mother family was very progressive, 
not religious at all. And on my father™s 
side they were a little bit more conserva
tive, but no religious. I wouldn™t call them 
as 
[indecipherable]
 religious. 
Q: Did you celebrate holidays, or Œ 
A: Oh yes, we Œ I understand. I don™t reme
mb er that, okay. I mean, they kept the Œ 
the Œ the Œ th e main holidays and, you 
know, Sabbath and things like that, you

know? They didn't ate s Œ kos
her, you know, the strictly 
[indecipherable].
 So th at 
mara Œ mo re or less has give you th e idea. 
Q: Mm-hm. And what was your sister™s name? 
A: 
Sophie
. 
Q: 
Sophie. 
A: 
Sophie.
 And in th e time of wa Œ wh en Œ wh
en Œ you know, the w-war start a nd 
oh, the troubled times, 
Sophie
 was six and a half. And she Œ she rememb er, you 
know, the wealth and all the happiness pre 
Œ pre-war. So affect her much more than 
a Œ than affects me, because I was un Œ no
 conscience about my Œ my own existence 
Q: Right. 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 I did. On Œ on the age of two, 
two and a half already, or a little 
bit mo re, I don™t know, 19 Œ 1942, when th
e first transport of people have been  
taken from the 
Warsaw
 ghetto to extermination camp, 
in that Œ in that transport 
went my family; my Œ my Œ my parent Œ 
my  Œ o-on both sides, for the exception of 
the Œ my Œ my mother™s brother, one of th
em have been killed. I don™t know if 
that™s by an accident or what, he be Œ was a fire on the roof in Œ in the ghetto. He 
went up to the roof, but never ca
me back. He was 25. His name was 
Ignatius. 
And 
the youngest brother my
 Œ of my mother™s, 
Henry
. He was 18 an d he Œ he to ok 
poison, he killed himself. But he was in th
e underground, the or
ganization, had been

caught, so in order to avoid, you know
, further consequences, he did that. I Œ 
Miriam, 
his younger sister, she had been taken 
to the Œ to the extermination camp 
with my  Œ with my  grandmother, who at th
at time was fift Œ 52 years old. And my  
mother was a widow on the age Œ ag
e of 30. 30? Thir Œ 31 - 32.  
Q: So, after the war started, what ha Œ 
wh at had happened to your family? Did they 
try to escape 
Warsaw
, or Œ 
A: No , wh en  my  mo ther Œ  my  mo th er Œ  
my mother befo re the war was always 

advising to leave to 
South America
, because a cous Œ my  ma Œ my  Œ my  Œ my  
grandma cousin, first cousin  was living in 
Buenos Aires
 and did well. So sa Œ 
always like a possibility which my mother alwa
ys considered in the thir Œ in the late 
30s. But my Œ my father was too attach
ed to, you know, position, he wa Œ the 
business was going well, and you know. 
They thought the war Œ nothing will 

happens, you know, so he was optimistic.  So they never fled away. And once was 

the war start, like everybody else, we Œ we
 have to move into
 the ghetto. And the 
reaso n  wh y my  mo m were n o t  ta
-taken and myself, and my 
sister, we were the three 
survivors, is because we di
dn™t live in the same place 
where my grandmothers live 
and the family. And me Œ my Œ my father, 
the older men of the fami ly, he Œ he was 
there with Œ with the rest 
when they close and they ah
 Œ they emptied the building 
and took everybody away. So, my  mo m wa
s Œ when she said well Œ she wa Œ she

didn™t Œ she didn™t have any doubts that th
is is not for taking her to the working 
camps, that was for extermination. So sh
e says, I am not waiting here for Œ for 
death, I am Œ I am running away. If I will be
 caught on the Œ on the run, at least I 
tried to do something for 
my  life. So she Œ you kn
ow, was corruption, like 
everywhere else. So she Œ she paid the peop
le to let us go, and they supposed to 
supply us with 
documents, aray Œ Aryan documents 
on the other side. They  Œ they 
didn™t follow to do that, they send us 
a Gestapo. So, my  mo ther was waiting and 
that took her a little 
bit more than she Œ sh
-she Œ es Œ expect to take. So she was 
very am Œ you know, nervous
 and watching if the peopl
e are comin g  and bringing 
the document. And then  sh-she showed  me
 the Gestapo car coming. So from the Œ 
from the back of the bu ilding we run away, just in time.
 So s Œ as Œ close calls like 
this, we had a couple of them. Ev
en when we was trying to leave 
Poland
 after the 
war, where the Œ the Iron Curt
ain was established by the 
Russians. So, in order to 
get out of 
Poland
 to the western 
Germany
 was a ri Œ also risking a life. But coming 
back to those times Œ so we Œ we left Œ 
we left the ghetto, and my mother remember 
from her young age that her father was ta
king the family to sp
end the summer to a 
place called 
Sa ndomierz
 on the south Œ on Œ a 
Œ a little bit south of 
Warsaw
 on the 
bank of th e 
Wis
a
 river. And so  sh Œ in order to run from 
Warsaw
, she went there 
with us. And that was a mistake, because 
in a small place, ou-ou-outside there is

noticeable immediately . So, very, very shor
t time after, we were 
on our way back to
 
Warsaw
. And of co urse those Œ those voyages
 cost money, and we Œ we didn™t 
have too man Œ too mu ch of it. So 
shortly after bri Œ getting back  to 
Warsaw, 
her 
economical resources had been exhausted, 
and was not mu ch to
 do, so she just 
present herself to a friend of her, made 
from school, from the elemental school, a 
Christian lady who was married to a policem
an, also Polish. And she says, well, if 
you refuse to help me, I understand. It™s a bi
g risk. But if you can™t, I have no one to 
call any mo re, you know. So Œ and she, she 
did so. Sh e said, wait. She hold us all 
the day there until the fire Œ the husband 
comes from work, and 
then she spoke to 
him by herself. And he comes convince by 
her Œ his wife, to help us. And they  
advise Œ the plan wh en  he Œ wh at he co
mes with was the following. My sister,  she 
was a blonde with blue eyes, that™s no pr
oblem. And Œ so she went to a Œ with Œ 
with Œ were nuns. 
Q: The con Œ the convent? 
A: Con-Convent.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: My mom, he brought her a false docum
ent, put her fa Œ photography in that, 
somebody who was deceased, mo re or le
ss o n  the same age. The name was 
Wovataska
(ph) 
Janina
(ph). And on these papers she 
should volunteer
 to work in

Germany
. And this way, according to  him, she would surviv e. And I was the 
problem, being circumci Œ and he knew 
a place where he can take me, but the 
condition was, to take kids there Œ so 
the kids who have 
no one, the orphans, 
abandoned. 
Q: Mm-hm. Mm, right. 

A: So Œ because for security reasons,
 no visits, nobody co
ming, nobody know. 
Q: Right. 
A: So that Œ that was a cond
ition for this. So he said to
 my  mo m, l eav e Œ  th e k i d s 
have t Œ the kid had to be left in the corn
er of the street w h ere I am due, where I am 
there, it™s Œ  it™s my Œ my pl
ace to work, no? And my moth
er couldn™t do that. Well, 
she had Œ didn™t have a heart to do that, so my
 poor sister have to di Œ do this for. So 
Œ 
Q: And Œ and your sister 
was how old at this point? 
A: She was Œ she was at that time , she wa s nine. So, she had to leave me in the 
corner and w Œ and, you know, just grab th
e first streetcar passing by, that what she 
did. And I almo st get her in, because I 
starte d to screaming myself. My sister 
[indecipherable]
. People start to surround me 
and the policeman comes and he 
took me, and 
[indecipherable]
 the people were, you know, that why

and the place called

Warsaw
, not far from 
Warsaw, 
very close to 
Wilarnow
, which is the Œ the Œ the Œ 
that was the Œ the summer pal
ace of the k Œ the king of 
Poland
 in other times. And 
the conven t where I went to, that wa
s a Methodist, it™s not Catholic, it was 
Methodist. So, being Protes
tants, you know, the German
s didn™t bother them, they 
thou Œ they thought they
 are part of them Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ right? Mas Œ or were more affin
ity. The woman who look after us, after th e 
kids inside, were all Jewish wo mens. Y eah, for security reasons, you know, so 

that™s no Œ nobody would denounce, you kn
ow. Were personally interested, right? 

In that™s time I had two years and tw o mont
hs in that time, when I get separate from 
my  mo m. And  in  Œ  in 1 946  in
 Œ in April Œ no, in April of
 you Œ Ap ril, end of April, 
my  mo m found us, my  sister and me, in a Œ 
and a ga Œ in a Œ in a Jewish orphanage. 
That was after the war, in 
Otwock.
 And that™s 30 kilometers southeast of
 Warsaw
, 
on th e eastern bank of the Œ of the river. In 
1945, when  the German
s start to retreat, 
obviously my sister  sa id 
something wh ich guides the people who are trying to  put 
the families together, because they knew ab
out this organization, and Œ and in no 
time I have been brin g fr Œ brought from that 
place to Œ to the place where my sister 
was. But I was not the only kid, so m-many of them, so I think th ey was just putting 

the Jew Œ Jewish kids together. So  maybe my
 Œ my  sister didn™t say tha Œ nothing, I

don™t know. So, we were taken to
 Otwock
. And well, I survived 
this way, and I s Œ 
wh en  my  mo m co mes, I was ju st r e  Œ  
convalescing from, I don™t know, one of 
those, you know, kids things
, measles or something like 
that. So I Œ I was separate 
from the rest of the kids, in or
der to avoid possible, you know Œ 
Q: Contamination, right. 

A: Œ epidemics, yeah, right, 
right. So the lady who was 
looking after me, her name 
was
 Dora
, she Œ she ask me to 
[indeciphera ble]
 that™s the Œ this Polish version of 
my name, yeah. Said, do you 
know what Œ who is this lady? And I wa Œ I look on 
her, I remember I 
[indecipherable]
 a momen t, no, and I said, well, that™s my mom. 
And my  da Œ my  mo ther start to cry. 
Q: It™s okay, take your time. 
A: Crazy. Said, what happened to her, what
™s wrong with her? 
I couldn™t understand 
why she™s crying, you know? Well, I wa
s too small to me asure the time and 
emotions and th ings like that. And th Œ sinc
e then my life changed.
 So, after that we 
tried to escape from
 Poland
, and we managed to do that. My mo m was a very brave 
woman, you know. Brave, have guts mo re
 than one man Œ man who would like to 
have it. And so we Œ we escaped from 
Poland
, three Œ four of us. Was my  Œ the 
three of, my mother, my sist
er, me, plus a young woman,
 she was 24 at that time, 
Mary la

she was a daughter of an officer who was a 
s Œ immediate superior to my  father av Œ 
my  Œ  my  Œ  my  mo th er co mes b ack  to
 Pola nd
, she was remarried. 
Q: Right. 
A: And she remarried a Polish man who was 
in the service, in the Œ when the Œ 
when  the troops occu pied 
Germany
, defeat 
Germany
, had been occupied by the 
alliances, so he was part of the Œ of the 
occupation troop. And 
he was in the Œ in 
RAF
 in 
Eng l and
, the Polish squadron, and so the 
Œ sh e remarried him. He was a 
very, very  good man, he was a excellent 
step father for me. Stepfather sounds bad, 
was a good father, I mean. 
And Œ but he was not Jewish
, he was Christian, so I 
didn™t live Œ grow in  the Jewish environmen
t with its relations 
and everything else, I 
have been depriv ed from that, all this.  
Q: Let me Œ 

A: In 1946, in oc Œ in octo Œ 
October, he had been transfer to 
England
, and with 
him, of course, the family. So
 Œ and also they say, was 
the kind of person, he says, 
well, we are Œ if we™re going to be a family
, one family, let™s have one surn ame, so 
he adopt us both. My daught
er Œ my  sister and me. And in October of the same 
year, we were in o Œ already in 
England, 
was an entirely different life. And we stay 
in 
England
 until 1949, and my parents decide for
 Argentina. 
So we emigrate to 
Argentin a
 in 1949. So the Œ wha Œ first, s
econd and th ird grad e, I made it in

England
, and th rough grade four I we
nt, i-in sp Œ in Spanish in
 Buenos Aires.
 
Well, and I studied in Spanish and I lived
 there until I reached the age of 38. Of 
course, I get married in the meantime to a 
Italian girl, a schoolmate, my  schoolmate, 
and we had four wonderful daughters.
 I lost my wife 10 years ago. 
Q: I™m sorry. 

A: And I have six grandchildren. And wh en
 this congress had a 
place in Œ in Œ in 
Toro nto
, comp letely by ch ance, somebody who 
I knew who was living in the Œ in 
massa Œ who lives in 
Massachusetts, 
called me by phone and said, oh listen, on so 
and so date, I Œ I™m going to 
Œ we are going to be in 
Toro nto
, herself and her 
husband. So we will like invite you for a di
nner Friday with us. And maybe you™re 
daughter and your s-son-in-law can join 
us. So I said, well, I™m answering by 
myself because I am n o  Œ I have no comm
itment, will be a pleasure, and about them 
I have to find out, I don™t know. They
 may be coming to something else Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ maybe they can. And that™s Œ really, 
that what happens, they  couldn™t attend, 
so I went by myself. So we Œ we tal Œ we
 talk about different things and finally 
comes a to pic, what brought you to 
Toro nto
? And so she mentioned that she is 
coming to a congress of
 the hidden children 
[indeciphera ble]
 hidden children of 
[indecipherable]
. What is this? She said, oh, yo
u know, the kids, you know, were

14
hidden and Œ you know, on the Ch ristian hous
es or here and th ere, and they Œ and 
the Œ in the churches. Say, I fit perfectly to
 this category. So Œ so I get interested, 
and that was my fir Œ first attendance, no re
 Œ with no registration, because I learned 
the Œ the same day, or very Œ very same day about. 
Q: Right. 

A: Next day was starting day,
 the Œ the congress. So I went there. I met lots of 
people, different people from different pla
ces, and I learn about some Œ I Œ I meet 
some people who were in
 Otwock
 at the same time I were
. Of course, now I Œ now 
I remember the 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Right. 
A: Because I was in the youngest group. Bu
t some Œ some of the people I met, they 
d o  rememb er my  sis ter , who  wa
s seven years older than  me. 
Q: Right. 

A: And so after that, I re Œ I was very 
excited about that, and I called my nephew. 
Okay , I have to tell you my  sister passed aw
ay very  young, on th e age of 46, that 

was in 1979. So , I called my  Œ my  nephew, and I mention to  him that I Œ because I 

knew always 
[indecipherable]
 he was very curious abou
t wh ere he is coming from 
and whatever, but 
hi Œ his story 
[indecipherable]
 story. But, you know, my  sister as 
well, she didn't have a chance Œ she was 
never in the Jewish enviro nment. She

married to a very nice person, but 
he was a Christian from the Œ from 
Pomerania. 
That™s the north ern part of
 Pola nd
, right on the sea, on the 
Baltic
. A very 
handsome, nice fellow, so they were Œ were
 okay, but the Œ the 
tr Œ all the tradition 
and ev erything what could be
, have been lost. So, some
how we were lost for the 
Jewish community, right? Bu
t my  s Œ nephew always was curious about that, and 
that was something wh ich, for obvious reas
ons, my sister didn™t talk about that. 
Q: Right. 
A: Because she was hidden, her br Œ her or
igin, as my mother did. As long my 
mother lived, I never menti
on my origin. I respect her will because listen, I d on™t 
know what she went through, 
what she passed, wh at ma ke her decide to take this Œ 
to decide that. So I were Œ I were no one to
 challenge her decision, so I accept it like 
this. Once Œ once before, she wa
s still alive, I come to th
e dilemma, what shall I do? 
If I shall say to my kids that I am Jewish
 or not? And that was Œ ma Œ ma Œ my  Œ 

my  Œ my  daughter was like Œ my  older da
ughter was like 10 years old, and the next 
one was almo st nine. And my  mo ther says, 
you know, this is so
mething, it™s a big 
question. I™m not in position to tell you 
wh at to do. And after, you know, a Œ a 
pause, she said, if you want to save them 
Œ to save them suffering, don™t say it.  
Q: Wow. 

 
Interview with WilliamKisielewski  
 
November 8, 2008 
 

 
 
16
A: That was what she told me. But I Œ I Œ 
I Œ I Œ you know, I kept thinking ab out it, 
and finally I told the deci
sion to say it, because in 
[indecipherable] 
maybe by 
ignorance, some of our Œ my kids be in 
the environment where th
ey will come to be 
a Œ maybe anti-Semitic or something like th
is. That™s what™ll be the worst thing 
what could happen to  me right now. So I sa
id that, and that was the time when my Œ 
my wife learned about my 
[indecipherable]
. And I said, well, don™t Œ you don™t 
have to worry about, because according to 
the Christian religion, I am a Christian, 
never mind ho Œ how my person 
is. I have been Christian, I still am Christian. But I 
don™t want to deny it, where I™m coming fro
m, and it™s nice to be able to say the 
truth. So  that™s was years ago, and then 
once ma Œ I had contact with Jews in my  
trade, because I was in the fur busine
ss. And I™d just been exporting fur from 
Argentin a
 to 
Euro pe
 
[indecipherable]
 when I matured to do that, before I was a 
furrier, then I come to be a wholesaler, a
nd then I comes to be 
an exporter. But the 
people wh o I knew an d I was dealing with al
mo st on the daily basis, mo st of them 
were Jews. Some of them, they come to be
 very close friends of mine. People mu ch 
mature, 30 years older than me. 
So they Œ they Œ 
they Œ they lived 
this period of the 
Holocaust entirely differently 
than I did. They were fi
 Œ 16 - 17, you know, young 
people, o-or 30 Œ 
Q: Right.

A: Œ wh en you Œ wh en I bor
n. So Œ and sh Œ well, 
make Œ always, youknow, 
exchanging point of view ideas and histor
ies and so in  Œ and that was something 
which was eating me up, you know, becaus
e on th e one side I were so close to 
them, and I want to be one of them. And 
that was the Polisher, because I speak very  
good Po lish, and I never learned to speak Yi

they invite me to have a tea in 
the house, that™s all, to get closer. And on
e of the ladies, who is 10 years older than

mention about this photograp hy and I brought
 that with me, the copy. And she say, 
one Œ one second. She went, and she 
brought the album, and had th e same 
photography made, because the one who 
was making the photos was her brother, 
her older brother. He Œ he

an excellent guide fo r you wh en  you go ther

I own on myself. Actually, we were s

 I met him, his wife. They were 
classmates, 
Sophie™s 
classma Œ classmates, so

Q: Right. 

A: Œ very  well. My feeling 
seems Œ the congress in Œ in 
Toro nto
 was very lucrative 
[indecipherable]
 I should call it like that. But a-also was emotional because I Œ I 
met people who I knew these people exist 
maybe Œ may exist, but I didn™t know 
how they are, where they are, right? And 
th en Œ but brought me back to the family. 
And wh en I met blum Œ

him and he didn™t know me, but I imagine 
that mu st be the person, and he was. 
Very pleasant. His wife was a little darling.
 And we stopped to ta

on the morning, was 12, lunchtime already,
 we were sti Œ still talking. So, you

know. We Œ wh en she Œ he knew
 that she was living to Œ to 
Britain
, to 
Lo ndo n
, 
and av  Œ nothing else, so Œ anyway , for me
 was to find, like us finding old family 
who I left many, many Œ lost many,
 many years ago. And 1966, in 
Buenos Aires
, 
on th e Œ on the platform, you know, waiting 
for a subway  Œ was a station where 
combined two different lines. 
Q: Right. 
A: So it always is full because you kno w, people change, it™s a mixture, in Œ 
interchange place. I saw Œ and Œ and Œ an-a
nd Œ and Œ in a Œ ho
w do you say, in a 
tremendous amount of people, 
I saw face, a woman™s face, and I felt Œ touched my 
heart, you know. Say, I know her, but you
 know, something very deep. I know her 
from much, might be from ve
ry, very long time ago. I didn™t know, I couldn™t 
remember, I was trying to remember, becaus
e the way impressed me, the fact I saw 
her. So in Œ in the meantime, I wa
s trying to get closer to her. 
Q: Right. 

 
Interview with WilliamKisielewski

A: And I close Œ I came to Œ and I Œ I decide

, I play chess, so I Œ I 
exercise my head  Œ memo ry all the time, you know. 
Q: Right. 
A: And I couldn™t rememb er where I know he
r from. So when I get close to her, I 
approach her in Polish, and she gets scared
, and th at, so I apologize in Sp anish, of 
course. I didn't meant to Œ to Œ to Œ and,
 but she respond in Polish, says, who are 
you? So  I say, well, I have my  
stepsfather
 surname. Well, what was your original 
name? So I told her, it didn™t meant noth
ing to  her. So  she said, where you were 
during th e war? When I mention where I were during the war, she embraced me. 
She asked me who Œ who else survive. So  Œ 
and this lady happens
 to be one of the 
ladies who look after us in this orphan
age where I were, when
 I was a very little, 
small boy. 
Q: Right. 
A: So the Œ the three pictures of my ch
ildhood, which I have and I possess, have 
been given to me by her, in 1966 in 
Bu enos Aires, Argentina. 
 
Q: Wow. 

A: The next Sunday after th

 my mother. It™s a very, 
very emotional. She lost all her family, 
and she marry Œ she remarried to a ma n who

my mo m, and I a Œ a Œ she said to me, you

the kind of trees in the Œ 
in the carriage, which we we
re on, with horses pulling it. 
But you know, this carriage is like a la Œ 
ladders
 on each side to Œ to Œ to carry, 
how to say, crops. So we were sitting th

doing so mething to me which I Œ makes me

thing. The many others, I don™t rememb er th
em, but through Œ ha
ve been told many 
times. I mil Œ I made them my me
mories, but really they not.  
Q: Right. 

A: So when we were coming 
back on the boat from there to
 Warsaw
, so I was a 
two years old kid, a little bit over two year
s, walking well, and I was still drinking 
my mother™s milk. And so was a little bit of a shame 
maybe, for some people. My 
mo m ma Œ my  mo m didn't want to depriv
e me of this, because she didn't have 
anything else to give me. 
Q: Right. 

A: So, I ha Œ I always carrying a little 
bench, and sitting my mom there and then 
pulling out the breast, you know. So, this
 is something which I don™t rememb er.

Q: Right. 

A: And the Œ 
Q: Do you reme mb er the day 
the war ended? Do you rememb

A: No.

[indecipherable]
 
A: No, I rememb er Œ I Œ I remember some action, wh ich have been  taken at the

I could eat it, but that is the only th ing 
I got, so I ate it. And those things were 
bringing dysen tery problems, terrible, too,

A: So we help each other when that occu

Q: Right. 
A: Œ into  the other. So those things, I di

Q: Right. 
A: Yeah. But in those times 
was the most natural thing.

Q: Right. 
A: So the sense of fear, that was unfamilia

sister, and to my mom. That™s why, y

to remarry, to the person 
[indecipherable]
 say well, she was one of the many Jews 
who didn™t want to be Jew. 

Q: Right. 

A: It was like a punishment to be a 
Jew, you know? And she was a young woman, 
she was only 35 when she re
married. And she was an attractive woman. The Œ her 
new husband was three years older than she was. So she was expecting to have a 

normal life Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ you know? And th e answer she gave me when  I ask her if I should tell or no 

my  dot Œ my  daughters, gives me an idea, 
a remote idea what sh
e could happen to Œ 
us to. 
Q: Right. 
A: In order to Œ you know, to feel like th
is. I Œ I™m sorry because I didn™t Œ when

to do that. And for me, I didn™t care. 
Q: Right. 
A: You know? And during the time I were living in 
England
, with other Polish 
families which mainly were anti-Semitic, with or with no reason, I wouldn™t major 

Œ I Œ I would be able to Œ how anti-Semitic 
[indeciphera ble] 
they will be just 
discriminating, or th ey will be hating the Jews. I don™t know that. But I am Œ the 

way I have been raise, you 
know, was a very, very importa
nt thing to Œ to keep my 
private parts, don™t show it. 
Q: Right. 
A: Don™t Œ don™t pee wh en the other kids 
are peeing, you know, th ings like that. So 
this Œ those are Œ were kind of, you know,
 limitations of normal life, which I were

da Œ da Œ somebody told me something wh
ich I don™t like, I Œ I Œ I spit on him, or 
kick him, or Œ or you know, no manners at

[indecipherable]
 I Œ I improve it by making a Œ 
big breasts, you know? Two big

interesting because you know, I mean, as 
Œ as a grow up person,
