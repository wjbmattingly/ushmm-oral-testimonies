Es telle was  the younger of two s is ters.  In addition to her par ents , her family inc luded many 
aunts, unc les  and c ous ins.  The Nazis  invaded Poland on September
 
1, 1939.  Soon after  the invas ion, 
E s telle a

in 1943, 
the 
family went into hiding in a bunker in the ghetto.  TheWar saw Ghetto Upr is ing 
began on April

, 
1943.  J ewis h

When Estelle, her s is ter  and mother arr ived in New York in 1947
, 
they had $30 between them.   
Es telle and her s is ter  went to work in the garm ent dis tr ict.  She m et her  hus band, who was  a s urviv or

After the birth of her  fir st s on, Estelle began attending c ollege in Cleveland and finis hed after 
they m oved to the Was hington, D.C. area in 1961, when her hus band joined the Kennedy 

Adminis tration. They have thr ee s ons. Estelle becam e a teac her  in Montgom ery County, Maryland,

>
>  Bill Bens on:  Estelle, thank  you so m uc h for  joining us and for  your  willingnes s to be our
 
Firs t Per s on
 
today. We'r e glad you made the jour ney from Chic ago to join us  again.  Thank  you very muc h.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  I'm very glad to be here.  I appr ec iate ever yone's  attendanc e here.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You have s o m uc h to s hare with us , Estelle, and we have a s hort per iod s o we'r e going 

to start right away.
 
 
You wer e just 10 when WorldWar II began with Germ any's  invas ion of Poland on 
September
 
1, 1939.  Befor e we turn to all that would happen
 
to
 
you and your fam ily dur ing the
 
war and 
its  Holoc aus t, let's s tart firs t with you telling us a little bit about your fam ily, your s elf, and your  

c om m unity in thos e year s  befor e the war  began.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  My fam ily was  a m iddle c lass  family.  I was  born in Wars aw, Poland.  Wars a
w 
s hines  in my s elective mem ory and golden radianc e of lilac  tr ees  against open blue skies , r ic h s ounds  
of good neighbors, kindness , and faith and love.  It was  a r ich life.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Estelle, both fr om  what you've s hared with m e and what I read in your  book , you were 

extremely c los e to your  father.  Tell us  about him.
 

3 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  My father was  a ver y philos ophic al per s on, a ver y kind person, very ins pir ing 
per s on.  He left an imprint on m e that ther e is  a fine line between the bes t in us  and the worst in us and 
neither 
p
urges  the other.  He left in me a faith and goodnes s , the healing that we are all par t
 
of one 
another
 a
nd to s urvive whole is  to love hum anity and be c om pas s ionate.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  m other , who had fled violenc e and
 
anti
-
Semitism in her native Rus s ia, tell us  
a little about your  m om.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  She taught m e feis tines s.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  My m other
 
--
 
J ewis h people wer e per s ec uted throughout c entur ies.  My m other  
was  c has ed out bec aus e s he was  of a differ ent r eligion, was  c has ed out of Rus s ia when s he was 
young.  I think  that s he taught me what s he lear ned about s ur vival by being pers ec uted as  muc h as  
s he 

taught m e what s he learned about the beauty of golden fields of wry, taught her  about appre
c iating 
beauty and s he tr ans mitted it to m y s is ter and m e. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ger many invaded Poland September
 
1, 1939, and they attacked Wars aw that very 
day.  W
hat do 
you
r em em ber of that fir st day and the s iege ofWar s aw that followed?
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  It was  a
 
s erene 
day.  In
 
s pite
 
of the fact that ther e was  a lot of talk  about war and 
the news  about the Nazi aggres s ion, in s pite of, ther e was  a lot of exc itement.  It's  har d to believe that 
war c an
 
generate 
exc item ent and vibranc e
.
  
There were pos ters  thr oughout the c ity s aying "We are 
r eady," "United."  But ac tually nobody was  ready.  
 
 
Nobody c ould im agine what war  r eally was  until it happened.
  
One peac ef
ul
,  
s unny day, a 
bom b was  dr opped onWar s aw
, s
ever al bom bs, as  a m atter of fac t.  And ac tually parliament was  
attacked without dec lar ation of war .  And then for the next m onth bombs  were raining on our heads.  

You never  knew when a bomb would land on your  building.  Streets were litter ed with c orps es.  At 

night, thes e humungous planes  would light up the sky.  Bom bs wer e just raining on us . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wrote in your  book , quote, in an ins tant, at the age of 10, I and Fr edka, 11
 
1/2, 
s topped being c
ar e
-
fr ee c hildren.  We began to carr y the tr agic  burdens  of life, end quote.  Can you s ay 
m or e about that?
 

> > Estelle Laughlin:  I think  in m any ways  it is  very ins piring to know that young people ar e
 
very wise 
and young people m ade dec is ions  and made c hoic es .  They have tr em endous  resourc es.  And I am 
always  c onc er ned when I s hare my s tor y, c onc erned how it affec ts  young people.  And looking at the 
audienc e, I s ee a num ber  of young people.  So to the young people I want to s ay that as long as you 
ar e going
 
to hold on to that whic h is  bes t in you
, 
to that whic h you believe is  r ight and good, no m atter 
what will happen 
to 
you you will be ok bec aus e you'll k now that the s tr ength of knowing that r ight is 
r ight and good is good.  It's all in you. 
 
> > Bill B ens on
: Wars aw held out for a m onth after  the Germ an invas ion of Poland.  You wrote that 
after  the Germ an Arm y m ar c hed into Wars aw on October
 
1, 1939, "Imm ediate
l
y m y life c hanged 
beyond imagination."  Tell us  about s om e of the changes.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Our onc e peac eful str eets wer e patr olled by foreign soldier s .  They walked into our 
hom es .  They said the Jewis h people, you know 
--
 
in or der  to be mean to people, in order  to put people 
down, you have to dem onize them.  And they s aid the J ewis h people ar e greedy and J ewis h people are 

all the bad things
 
in
 
s pite of the fact that they walked into our  hom es like c ommon thieves  or stopped us  
in s tr eets and helped them s elves  to whatever they wanted to.  They imm ediately c los ed s c hools .  They 

m ade book s  illegal.  They r ationed all food.  They s topped the elec tr ic  power . We had no telephones , 
c ouldn't reac h anyone, even in c as e of an emergenc y.  We had no news papers . We had no 
r adios .  
We wer e c ut off from the wor ld and fr om vir tually ever ything that was  taking 
plac e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I was  struc k  by s om ething you s aid to m e.  You s aid that childr en helped by keeping 

watc h for Germ an s oldier s  and helping
 
to hide c ontr aband.  Can you will s ay a little bit about that?
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Right
.  With 
--
 
again, c o
ming back to the r es our cefulnes s  that c hildren have.  Of 
c our se, 
you never  know how s mar t and how r es ourc eful you ar e until you ar e c onfronted with a 
pr oblem .  I think that we all find our strength and we all find our r es our c es when we ar e put to tes t and 
we really know what we believe in and what we s tand for.  
 

4 
 
 
I forgot the question. 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  ok .  You had mentioned how alr eady the kids were playing a r ole already.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Right. Well, I think  the magic  in c hildr en is that they hold on to their inner s elf.  
And no matter how terr ible things  were, we found ways  to play.  We als o, while we played, we kept 
watc h for the s oldier s .  When we s aw a s oldier in the dis tanc e, we quickly r an home and told our  

par ents to h
ide quickly
 c
ontr aband like br ead or a penc il or a book . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was n't long befor e all the J ews  ofWars aw were forc ed to m ove into what would 

bec ome k nown as  the Wars aw Ghetto.  And you would s pend your next thr ee years  in the Wars aw 
Ghetto. 
 
Tell us about your  life in the Wars aw Ghetto.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  They built a thick  wall ar ound us .  They filled 
the ghetto 
--
 
the 
ghetto was tiny.  I 
think  it was  like 30% of the c ity's  population were restr icted in 1/3 of the c ity's  area.  So it was  
very, very 

tiny.
  
They filled the ghetto with people dr iven out from s urrounding areas .  Mos t people c ame without 
s hoes , on foot, without a penny in their pock ets.  Ther e was  not enough hous ing.  There was  not 

enough food.  Ther e was  not enough c lothing.  
People wer e dying in s tr eets .  People were c overing the 
bodies  of dead childr en with pos ter s  s aying "Children ar e the Holies t thing."  Indeed, they are.  Our 

c hildren m ust live. 
 
And yet in this  infer no, immediately the J ewis h people organized thems elves  i
n s elf 
aid c enters .  
 
 
I am us ually very mindful of stres s ing the fact that ther e was  tr emendous  res is tanc e.  
Sometimes people ask ed me why didn't you fight back.  It's a very painful question, a very sad one.  
And I understand that it's meant well but we did fight back . We fought back  with ever ything that was  in 
us  to hold on to our values , what we believed was  good and r ight.  There was  no ar med r es istanc e for 
two reas ons .  One r eas on was  that ther e wer e no
 
--
 
ther e was  no way of obtaining arms .
  
Another
 
one 
was  that if you as  m uc h as  whis per ed a wor d of protest, not only wer e you killed but your  neighbors, the 
whole s tr eet they would pull out that that was  a form of enforcing dis c ipline and fear, would be killed.  
So the logic al thing would be to just learn to have patienc e and hope that the war would be over.
 
 
But how did we fight back?  To own a book was  an ac t of 
defianc e.  All over the ghetto 
--
 
that 
was  c apital punis hment.  All over the ghetto ther e wer e hidden libraries .  My father  had a s tas h of hi
s 
favor ite books by Shalom  Aleic hem, Shalom As ch, nights c overed with blac k  c over s  to 
k eep 
our  
exis tenc e s ec ret.  My father would pull out books and r ead to us .  His voic e would flow, s waddling us , 

br inging to wor ld, r emote wor lds .  Our r oom was  like a c ap
s ule of paradis e s eparating us  from  the 
c urfew quiet outs ide our window.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Still, you were, of c ours e, under so many extraor dinar y, brutal r estrictions  yet you've 

told m e you still found ways  to c elebr ate holidays .  And there was  c landes tine
d 
art and theater taking 
plac e in the Wars aw Ghetto, whic h, inc identally, wer e 400,000 J ews  in that enc los ed s pac e.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Right.  They were hidden all over the ghetto.  There wer e brave teac her s who 
r is ked their life to teac h children in tiny little r oom s to hold on to their faith and love and faith and 
hum anity.
  
Ther e wer e theaters.  Im agine theater s when there was  no br ead.  There was  a ver y 
r em arkable his torian and author in the ghetto, Haim Kaplan.  He said it was  s trange, that when we 
s eem to not need it at all, we need poetry mor e than we need bread.  And it is  tr ue.  The s oul needs to 
be fed, too.  The s oul needs  to be nour is hed, too. 
 
 
You m entioned the holidays .  Guns  hovering over our heads  did not s top us  
to 
c elebr ate 
holidays .  On Pas s over we
 
m ade s ure that there was  Matzoh
 
in every hous e.  And, of c ours e, that was  
only pos s ible at the beginning but not later.
 
 
There was  not a c hild that I have known who was  over the age of 10 who did not do 
s om ething to help thos e who wer e s uffering m or e than they them s elves  s uffer ed. We put on 
c landes tine
d 
s hows  to r ais e money for the m or e needy people.  So that was  our for m of fighting back .  I 
think  it took  a lot of c our age and determ ination.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  father, as  you mentio
ned,
 
was  a philos opher.  He
 
believed books  wer e 
important to have.  He believed in theater .  But you s aid that your m other foc us ed m or e on pr actical 
ways  to s urvive.  Say s om ething about your m other's r ole in there.
 

5 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Yeah.  My mother was  more foc us ed.  I think you referr ed to exam ples  that I gave, 
that I onc e s hared m y lunc h with a beggar.  I gave it away.  And m y m other's r es pons e was , "You 
know, we don't know if we'll have bread tom orr ow and we have to be s ure that we m aintain our health 
s o we'll be s tar ving, you'll have s om e fles h on you.  So if you want to s hare things , m ake s ure you as k  
m e for mor e food s o that you don't give yours  away.
ﬂ
  
My father's  res ponse was :  
ﬁ
You know how 
hungry you were not eating one lunc h.  You c an't im agine how hungry the c hild that you s hared your 
s andwich with was , s o you did the r ight thing.
ﬂ
  
He s aid, 
ﬁO
f c our se your m om said it to protect you but 
you did the r ight thing.
ﬂ
  
So, yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  m other  was, I think, ver y worr ied, abs olutely rightfully s o, about dis eas e 
outbreaks.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Yes.  She was  on a r ampage to c lean the hous e.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  And m ake s ur e that ever ything is  clean.  She even
 Œ 
oc c as ionally 
--
 
of c ours e, we 
had no c hocolate but oc cas ionally we would have a piec e of c hoc olate.  She even was hed the 

c hoc olate. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In thos e c ir c um stanc es, how did you find food?  How did m anage to eat? 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  That's a ver y inter esting ques tion.  The food allowance, the r ationed 
food, was  
about les s than 10% of the daily r equired c alor ie r equirem ent.  Mos t of the people wer e dying of 

s tarvation.  But there was  als o illegal smuggling.  So we had that wall and the wall was  topped with, 
with broken glas s  and barbed
-
wir e.  But ther e wer e smuggler s .
  
The best smugglers  wer e childr en, 
m os tly boys no older than 6 or 8.  They were like little m ic e, remove br icks under the wall and c r awl 

thr ough the wall.  When they were c aught, they were killed.  If they were not c aught, then their parents
 
had a m eal that day.  
 
 
Of c ours e, the s tar vation was  s o pr ofound.
  
There was  als o offic ial sm uggling.  By that I mean 
that there were big smugglers.  And they wer e Nazis  and Polis h guar ds  who lined their pockets  with 
br ibery.  And for  that they would open the gate and the guar ds would look  the other  way and wagons  of 
food would be s m uggled thr ough.  So ther e was  s m uggling.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Nazis  s tarted deporting large num ber s  of J ews  out of Wars aw to death and 

c onc entration c am ps in 1942
.  F
or a s ubstantial period your  family was  able to avoid being depor ted.  
How did your  parents  m anage to protec t all of you from being tak en and s ent to c am ps in
 
thos e year s 
of 1942 until 1943?
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  The deportation began J uly
 
1942.  The month of m y 1
3th birthday.  It was  c arried 
out 
with 20th c entur y know
-
how and Stone Age values .  At first we had no idea that depor tations  meant 
death.  J ewis h people
 
--
 
s om e of them  wer e for c ed to wr ite letter s  s aying that they were in c amps 
wher e they wer e fed and s heltered.  So you c an im agine that m any people who wer e living in s treets, 

who were homeles s , who wer e fam ished went voluntar ily and unknowingly to death.  B
ut m any people 
hid.  
 
 
And where does  one hide in an apar tm ent building?  Usually no different than c hildr en play 
hide and go s eek. We hid behind c ouc hes, between m attr es s and box s pr ings, in c ardboar ds , in 
dr awer s .  Any little c or ner  that you c ould find.
  
My  family obs c ured one r oom  by putting a war dr obe in 
fr ont of the door.  And this  is  how we hid.  It was  random  luck .
 
 
Fr om J uly
 
1942 to Septem ber
 
1942, a m er e two, two and a half m onths , 99% of the c hildren 
were deported and killed.  Can you im agine a wor ld without the sound of childr en
, w
ithout the presenc e 
of a grandm other  or a grandfather?  Bec aus e old people and c hildren were the fir st to be killed.
  
A t first, 
we had no idea.  But the people that wer e tor n away from us, we never  hear d from  them but s

people m anaged to c ome back.  They did it during the night and found their way.  They hid on the 

c or pses, on the ashes, and they found their  way bac k  to Wars aw, to the ghetto.  And they told us about 
the hor rific tr ain rides to a plac e c alled Tr eblinka
 
wher e our  people were gas s ed, c hildr en wer e gass ed.
 
 
It's  har d to im agine how human beings who have m others  and s is ters, who love their  c hildr en, 
c ould do s uc h things.  I think this  is the r eas on why I'm s haring m y stor y.  And I believe that this  is  the

eas on why you are here, to be r eminded the cruelty we are c apable of and perhaps that will r em ind us  
of the importanc e of love and c om pas s ion.

that I was only 13.  My father s aid, "Oh, I'll never let them tak e you away from  me."  "I'll burn their eyes  
out with ac id."  I believed him  that I was  s afe if only in his  love bec aus e I k new that he was  helpless .

the people just disappear ed.  At the point when ther e 
were very few people left in the ghetto, only the ghetto was  r educ ed to three s ub ghettos  whic h wer e

s 
were just thr ee s egm ents  of s tr eets .
 
 
The only people who c ould live

I m ean, we los t our r ights  to live.  And the only people who 
were s till perm itted to live wer e the ones  who were working in factories .  So m y mother and s is ter and I 
got per mis s ion to work in a fac tor y.  My father was  not.  Thes e were c alled the wild people.  And s o 
ther e wer e num bers  of wild people who were liv ing, hiding, between us , among us.
 
 
There were s o few people left.  Wars aw was  an anc ient c ity.  And m ost people lived in 
apar tm ent buildings .  We were the only family in the apartment building left.  Ther e was  s uc h s ilenc e.  

The s ilenc e was  palpable.  I would s om etim es stic k  my head out the window or the door  hoping to hear 
other neighbor s  but all I c ould hear was  r eally s ilence gr owing towards  me.

and 
your  father were c alled a wild one bec aus e he was  not able to have a 
work permit but you wer e s till in the ghetto when the r em arkableWars aw upris ing took  plac e.  And 

then, 
the s ubs equent horr ific  obliteration of the ghetto.  Tell us  about theWar s aw upris ing and what 
happened to you and your fam ily.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Well, I m entioned that s ome people m anaged to get bac k  and tell us  about 
Treblinka.  When we found out what was  happening to the people, that they wer e gas s ed, the 

r em ainder of the people in the s ub ghettos  began to organize thems elves  in 
arm ed 
r es is tanc e.  My 
father was  a mem ber of the arm ed r es is tanc e, too.  And they s tarted to build bunkers.  The bunker s 
were in the bas em ent.  They built a network of bunkers .  And they als o dug tunn
els  to lead them to 
navigate between the bunker s .  And they als o used sewers  and tunnels  for  the other s ide of the wall, to 
obtain arm s to fight back .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your fam ily was als o able to build a bunker.  Tell us about the bunker  that you had.
 

>> 
Estelle Laughlin:  Right.  So im agine that, you know, that your exis tence on top of the earth is  going 
to c eas e and that you are going to c r awl and live in the nether wor ld.  Our bunker, the entr anc e to our

our 
apar tm ent then was  on the ground floor.  And the bunker was  in the bas ement.  And, of c ours e, you 

had to have a s ecr et entranc e to the bunker.  Our entranc e to the bunker was  the powder  room floor 
and commode. 
 
All would lift and then 
you 
would go down into the bunker.

Events  er upted with Nazi s oldier s  m ar c hing into the ghetto, with arm ed c ars , with tank s , with a 
flux of bomber planes , and with humungous loud speaker s announc ing that we better r epor t for  
deportation or els e they'll kill us  all.  They c alled it r es ettlement
.
  
We knew what r es ettlement meant s o 
we jus t opened the trap door , walked down the stair s .  It was  a flims y ladder , pulled the trap door  down.
 
I felt c ut off from the world.  I felt tr apped.  The dam p walls  c los ed in 
on me.  The dam p c ell pr es s ed 

down on me.  The flickering of the light was  our s ubs titute for the s un.  The tic king of the c lock  was our  
only r em inder , our only c lue when morning was  r is ing, when s un was  s etting.  How I m is s ed the open

fighting er upted on the str eets, fac ing a 20th 
c entur y Army, ar med fr om  head to toe, fac ing tanks and fac ing arm ored car s  and fac ing flocks of 

planes  was a handful of poor ly c lad, poor ly fed, poorly ar med [Indis c er nible].  They c limbed up on

ewers  
to str eet corners  and lobbed Molotov c oc ktails , hand gr enades, fire thr owers , whatever  they had.
 
It is  noteworthy that
 
it took  that group of fighters longer to fight than it took for  
Franc e 
or for Poland to

that point ther e was  no cor ner, no plac e to hide anymore.  They dr ug us  thr ough the streets.  Flock s  of 

planes , the sky was  blac k  with planes , bombs  were falling all around us, buildings  wer e c r um bling to 
our  feet.  Flam es, enor mous flam es , wer e lic king the sky in and painting it in other worl dly c olor s  of

s auntered
.  They dr agged us to Umsc hlagplatz, the deportation.  They loaded us  on 
to freight trains . We were on the tr ain through the night.  And jus t for  the s port of it, s oldier s were 

s hooting at the tr ains .  People in 
c ongealed blood all ar ound us .

of a pic tur e of J ews  being pulled out of the Wars aw Ghetto.  And ther e was  a family in the front.  It was  
jus t so eas y to pic ture that being you, your  mother  and your  father, your sis ter in their  plac e.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  You know, we wer e not a s war m of nameles s people. We wer e people like 

ever yone.  Ther e were mother s.  Ther e wer e m others  holding on to hands of c hildren that they wanted 

des perately to take home and tuck  them  into bed.  Childr en s om etim es  ask  me how did you feel ins ide.  
Ins ide me I felt no different than my gr andc hildren, than all c hildren feel like.  I, too, wanted to c atch a 
ball s oaring through the

.  
I, too, wanted to take my family and my fr iends  for  gr anted.  I, too, wanted 
to feel the dam p gr as s  under m y feet.

both

,  
s lave labor and exter m ination c am ps
,  
were enc ir cled by elec tr ified bar bed

wir e fenc es, guards  
ever y few feet with beams  of light following you.  In Majdanek  ther e was  a c rematorium  and c himneys .

If th
at was not enough, in the as s em bly field they had a gallow and 
gibbet
 
to s car e us  even m or e into 
obedienc e.  People were dangling ever y day, our friends , like limp puppets.  And, you know, we 
s ur vived it all with holding on to our hum anity and to c om pas s ion and joyful life.
 
 
My father was  s eparated from us . When we ar rived, men, wom en, and c hildren wer

s eparated.  My father  s at with a group of m en.  My s is ter , m y m other  and I s at ac ros s  the field from him .  

He was  very s ic k at that point.  He had fever.  He s at in the front row s o my s is ter  and mother and I did.  

I looked at m y father.  He looked s o ill.  I was  so us ed to looking into his  eyes  for  c omfort, for

that was  before 
we had to s hed our c lothes  and befor e we went thr ough the s election in whic h a s oldier  dres s ed neatly 

with white gloves , would s ort people
, 
who would ac t like a ps eudo guar d, saying this  one will live and 
this  one will die.  This  was  what s elec tion was like.
 
 
I had a photogr aph when we were ac tually walking towar ds  the s hower s .  We knew about the 
s howers . We knew that the s hower s  wer e really gas.  And when we walk ed into the s howers , the water 

had a lot of dis infectant in it.  So we
 
had no idea whether  it was gas  or  water.  It happened to be water.  
We didn't s hout.  We didn't 
s
c r eam.  Not bec aus e we wer en't indignant. We were ver y indignant.  I 
c ould have s c r atc hed their  eyes  out.  But 
I 
did not c ry becaus e I wanted to s pare m y par
ents  my tear s .  
And als o, I was  too pr oud to s how my tears .  I knew that was n't a thing that I c ould do.  So I had this  
little photogr aph prior as we were going to the s howers .  And a s oldier stopped m e and said, "Tell me 
what are you hiding?"  I s aid, "I'm not hiding anything."  I hid the photogr aph in the lining of m y s hoe.  I 

thought, well, if I lied to him  and I s ay I have nothing
 
--
 
I was  afraid to lie.  So I pulled out the 
photogr aph.  I said, "It's  the only thing I have.  May I have it?"  And he s natc hed it from me. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I k now this  is  really har d to do in the tim e we have, Estelle.  Things wer e horrible for 
you at Majdanek .  But fr om  ther e you would als o then be s ent to s everal labor c am ps.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your mother just played s uc h an inc r edible role with you and your s is ter now, keeping 

you together and protec ting you.  Tell us a little bit about what you c an and the events  that led up to 
your  liberation.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Well, in Majdanek, s lave labor , digging from one place to another .  The purpos e of 

Majdanek was  an extermination c amp
, a
n extermination factory.  So the exis tenc e of it was  to kill 
people.  So there was  no work  s o we just did us eles s  wor k , whic h was ver y, very hard. 
 
My s is ter in 
Ma
jdanek was  beaten ver y badly.  In my book  I des c r ibe the c irc um stanc es .  
 
 
You know, it's interes ting now to think  that I want to m ention the poetr y, wr iting, in c as e I 
forget. 
 
 
So my s is ter  was  beaten ver y badly and s he c ouldn't go to work the following
 
day
 a
nd s o hid 
her  under the bunk s .  The s oldier s  c ame and found
 
--
 
whom ever  they found in the c am p, they put you 
on the lis t.  The as s um ption was  if you wer e on the lis t, you were going to the gas  c hamber. We had a 

pac t that if one of us go to the gas  c
ham ber, all thr ee of us will go. 
 
So m y m other  and I traded places  
with two other people.  And the following day, when my s is ter's  nam e was  c alled and the two other 

nam es , my mother and I r eported.  This  is what saved our  lives .  We wer e put on a train and
 
s hipped to 
Skarzys ko, whic h was  a s lave labor  c am p.
  
The two people with whom  we traded plac es, unfortunately 
pr obably never made it out of ther e.

I wanted to als o m ention that even in Majdanek  when life was  s o tortur ous
, 
we wer e 
c om pos ing s ongs and poet
r y.  We didn't do it
 
--
 
we had no penc ils  or paper
 
s o it was not to wr ite it 
down;
 
it was  not for his tory but all that was  r eally left was  our  ability to s peak , to s how our indignation to 
s how
 
--
 
to expres s our longing.
  
So, yes , the s oul always  talks .  The s oul always  feels. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  If you don't mind, as you wer e on your way to one of the cam ps , Skarzys ko, the tr ain 
s topped and you cr edit that with ac tually saving your  lives.  Can you s ay a little bit about that? 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  So another
 
r andom luck  thing.  My s is ter
 
--
 
the train stopped on the way fr om 
Majdanek to Skarzys ko.  My s is ter  had to go to the bathroom.  There was one s top.  And then they 

s tarted to s hoot.  We were r us hing to get back on to the train.  So we got in the wrong c ar
 w
hic h 
happened to be the r ight c ar  bec aus e Skar zys ko had thr ee differ ent c amps .  Eac h one of them was  

owned by a Germ an ar m factor y.  But one was  produc ing gunpowder.  And gunpowder s ettled in your 

s kin where the people looked c ompletely yellow and on your  lungs, and people c ould live only like 
weeks  or m onths s o wher e they were c om pletely dis pos able.  And we ended up, bec aus e we went into 
the
 
wr ong c ar, we ended up in the c am p wher e we wer e working on bullets . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you would end up at another c amp yet
 
--
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Whic h was  es s entially the s ame.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e there, I think , when you were liber ated.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Right.  So im agine a m irac le.  This  is  after all of thes e years  fr om  

September
 
1939, this  is  J an
uar y
 
1945, Poland is very c old
, g
r ound is c overed with ic e and s now.  After  
all of thes e years.  And we wer e s o s epar ated.  We were s o is olated.  It was  impos s ible to believe that 

only a few r abbit hops away from us  people wer e s ailing on silver  lakes and c hildren wer e s itting 
ar ound tables  with fam ilies  like c hildren should.  And then after all of these year s  we hear this  r umble of 
the planes , bom bs  falling.  We s ay, oh
 
--
 
I'm smiling now when I s ay we hear d the bombs falling 
bec aus e, really, that was like
 
fr om heaven.  We were on death r ow, dying 
but
 
allied bom bs would be 
s uc h a dignified death.  And we kept on s aying, when they paus ed, 
ﬁP
leas e don't stop,
ﬂ ﬁ
pleas e don't 
s top.
ﬂ
  
And in the m orning we wer e liberated. 
 
 
Now, I want to as s ur e you that liberation was  not ver y unlikely
 
--
 
like you ar e probably 
imagining it.  In m y book I des cr ibe it.  A large portion of m y book is about liber ation bec aus e very little 

was  written about it.
  
I told you it was  in J anuar y.  All we wear  is  wooden clogs, loos e
 
--
 
ther
e were no 
s tockings , no s c ar ves .  It's  am azing how muc h cold and hunger  we c an endure and s till r emain hum an.  

And in the m or ning the gate is opened and we s huffle out.  It's ic y.  It's  c old.  The c amp was  s ur rounded 
outs ide the fence by no
-
m an's land. We
 
s huffled thr ough this , not even an inkling of light.  We c om e 
out and we hear s oldiers.  We didn't know whether they were Germ an s oldier s
 
--
 
I don't know why we 
would s us pec t but we were always  afr aid of the wars .  And we wanted to run bec aus e we knew tha
t this 
was  the fr ont line.  What if the Nazis  c ome back?  We c ould hardly move.  We s ee the Rus s ian s oldiers  
and we r un up to them .  And we s ay, all teary
-
eyed, "Do you know how long we've been waiting 
for
 
you?"  It was  like m es s iah was  ther e.  "Do you kno
w how lo
ng we've been waiting for you?
"
  
And they 
s aid, "We have a war  to fight."  
 
 
That was  J anuary.  The war  was n't over until May, I believe.  And they did have a war  to fight.  
And they s aid
 
--
 
they looked at their watc h and they gave us  a s lab of bre
ad.  They s aid, "You better  
find s helter bec ause there's  c urfew."  At that point I don't know if we wer e more afraid of dying of cold 
and s tar vation than being arrested for br eaking the c urfew.  So we s huffled out.  We look ed s o dreadful, 
c over ed with lic e
 
and m ange.  And the people were really turning away fr om us.  Ther e wer e no 
dis plac e pers ons c am ps . We were s o hungr y.  And we enc ountered s ome other people from the cam p.  

They s aid
, ﬁ D
own the street there is  a pickle factor y and you c an go ther e.ﬂ  
So 
we c lim bed thr ough a

Hi.  Thank you for  s har ing your stor y with us .  I was  just wondering if after everything that you have

that.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Yes, I was .  A year  ago I went with a pr es idential de

bac k  to the str eet where I was  dr agged out fr om the bunker.  I c ame back

when I left, the plac e, 
Wars aw, was  engulfed in flam es .  I c ame back as  an Amer ic an citizen with the delegation of a c ountr y 
that r epr es ents what is

in freedom, equality for e

Thank you s o m uc h.  You m entioned r andom luc k  two tim es .  And you s aid the end of liber ation was  
a mir ac le.  Did anybody ever talk about God?

was  
ther e talk about God's  role in all of this ?

You know, God and r eligion is  a ver y per s onal thing.  Dur ing the war  ther e wer e 
m any people in the ghetto who held on to their faith.  Other  people
 
--
 
m y family was  not r eligious .  I am 
a ver y s pir itual per son.  I feel ver y c onnected to everyone and everything that is  living.  For  s ome 
people it was  very hard to believe.  The indignation, how c ould anyone, how c ould God permit c hildren 

to be killed?  On the other  hand, there were others  who held on to religion s aying, thinking, that r eligion 
pr es ented the
 
unity of all m an, in the eyes  of God we ar e all his  c hildren no matter what we believe.  So 
yeah.
