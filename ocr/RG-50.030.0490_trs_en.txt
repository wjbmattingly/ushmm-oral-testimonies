SIBYLLE SARAH NIEMO ELLER 
 December 1, 2004 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Sibylle. 
Answer: Good morning. 

Q: It™s so nice to see you. What 
was your name  when you were born? 
A: My name  was Sybilla Augusta Sophia von Sell
. Augusta after my mother, and Sophia after 
my aunt, it™s -- it™s a family name , and Sybilla 
after the pr incess of Coburg and Gotha who la -- 
later became queen -- crown prin
cess of Sweden, and is Gustav™s mother -- was Gustav™s 
mother.  

Q: And your name  now? 

A: My name  now, I dropped -- I -- 
I didn™t quite drop Augusta, I stil
l use it as an initial. My 
name  now is Sibylle Sarah Niemoeller. It™s 
my Jewish name, and I -- I picked it myself. 
Q: And you keep von Sell as your -- 

A: Yes, as a -- 

Q: -- as a family -- as the family name. 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And it™s Sybilla, it™s not Sibyl -- 

A: Yes, but you know, it™s Sibylle, re
ally, I be -- in this country, 
I prefer to be called Sibylle. 
Q: Sibylle. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. And when were you born? 

A: On the 10
th
 of April.

Q: And the year? 
A: 1923. 

Q: 1923, okay. Some how I thought it was 1924. 

A: No. 

Q: But no, it™s 1923. 

A: No. 

Q: And whe r e were you born? 

A: I was born Potsdam.  

Q: And did you -- 

A: The cradle of Prussian military. 

Q: Yes?  And how long did you stay there? 

A: Until I wa s two and a half years ol d, that ™s when
 my fa mily moved to --  my father had a new 

position, and we moved to Berlin, but not to Berlin Dahlem yet, but
 we stayed in -- in another 
half suburb of Berlin, which was known 
for being nice, and quiet, and cheap. 
Q: Uh-huh. So tell me  -- I would like to get a 
sense of your family. Tell me about your mother 
first, and then we™ll go to
 your father, and the --  
A: Yes, of course. 
Q: -- and what the home life was like. 

A: Oh, by the way, since you asked my -- my na me s, 
I was not -- the authorit
ies have to come  to 
my parents after my birth to tell them what my
 na me  was going to be. They had not counted on a 
girl. I was to be -- I was to be a boy because 
my father had lost his three brothers -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

A: -- in the first World War, which was such 
a tragedy. And here come s a girl, so not everybody 
was terribly amused. My mother -- I was my 
mot her™s second child, because she had been 
ma rried before, she wa -- ma rried at age 19, 
a Baron von Hornstein, who not only had a Jewish 
grandmother, but was the rightful heir to the na
me -- I™m sorry, he was the child -- he was the 
great, great grandchild of Lord Nelson and Lady Ha
milton. That™s the one thing I en -- I always 
envied my sister who -- my st
epsister -- half sister, who is 
10 years older than I am, always 
envied her for it. 
Q: So your mother ma rried into that fa mily? 

A: My mother ma rried into that fami ly, that wa
s a zo -- the -- they are 
-- that was old nobility 
around Lake Constance, and very Catholic, so she 
had to agree that in case my half sister was 
born as a boy that he had to be brought up Catho
lic, which is, I think, a ve
ry brutal decision to 
split a family that way. Well but so he was bor --  he
 was baptized in the Protestant faith, and then 
my mother lost her husba nd during the first few 
weeks of the first World War, and became very 
ill with tuberculosis, which meant she -- thanks to the help of the fr iend of the fa mily, the vict or -

- Queen Victoria™s great grand-nephew, the c
ount of Coburg and Gotha -- not count, I™m sorry, 
the duke of Coburg and Gotha saw to it that she 
was put in a -- in a -- a sanitorium, and she 
survived very well. She died at 93. My mother™s fa
mily is by far -- is lo -- a lot older than my 
father™s family. My father™s family, of which I™ll talk later, they were really newcomers to 

nobility, me aning they were mor -- they were n
obilized in 1657, while my mother™s fa mily goes 
back to -- to Charlema gne, documented. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. And they were pa rtially -- they we -- they came from the east, how much Slavic 

influence there was, we can only guess. A lot, I would say. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

Q: Why?  
A: We ll, I -- some ti me s, you know, the Vens, that Slavic tribe that ruled Ge rmany between the 

river Rhine and the --  and the -- or  not -- not th
e Rhine, the El ba, and the Oda, they ruled in 
Germany, a wild tribe, for thre
e to 400 years. So everybody has 
Vendish, Solbic, Serbic blood in 
them. And my mother was born -- my
 mother™s father was a Prussian general, and he had been 
one of -- his name  was von Brauchitsch, 
Brokovitce, you know, God knows what it was 
originally. And my -- my  grandfather was a Prussian
 general, as was my father™s father. And he 
was one of 23 children. 

Q: 23? 

A: Yes, his father had married several time s,
 and there were your children, my children, our 
children. And there are funny lege
nds going around about that family like a -- a Brauchitsch 
officer stopped the little guy on -- in -- in a m
ilitary school, asked for his name  and then found 
out they were brothers. How ma ny of
 them are true, I never -- I call them legends. So they were -
- they didn™t have much money of course, and my -- my -- 

Q: So being nobility didn™t mean that you had money?   

A: Oh, absolutely not -- 

Q: So you had privilege? 

A: -- I mean, that™s how the Crusades once started. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A: Get the second and third son, get them out of
 t he way, give them some t hing to do. And no -- 
and the -- the -- my oldest uncle, my mother™s ol
dest brother, he inher
ited this fabulous castle, 
the Rimburg, which is on the border from Ger ma
ny to Holland, to the Ne
therlands, and the n -- 
Holland claime d it after this last war, and my
 unc le was very happy about it, but then the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
5 
 
 
Germans got it back. And my moth
er had -- there were six or se
ven children. Uncle Siegfried 
was the oldest, and my grandmother was 18 years old, and she had the baby, as was done in 
those days, at home, but thank goodness with the help
 of a -- of a doctor. 
And he wa -- wa -- held 
the baby and declared him dead, and put him on a chai
r, and after awhile that
 dead child began to 
howl and yell, and he -- he lived. An
d the -- the doctor told my -- my grandfather that that was to 
be the first and only child. Oh, the -- she had a Ca
esarian, which in those days, can you imagine?  
And after the Caesarian she had 
right away one more child afte
r the other, seven altogether. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. And died comp letely exhausted and spent at age 49. 

Q: So this was your mother™s mother? 

A: That™s my mother™s mother. I never me t her, of course. 

Q: Right. Now was your mother educated? 

A: No. Girls in those -- 
Q: Girls were not educated. 
A: -- days, girls in those days were pitifully off.
 Really, she went to a 
-- she went to a gi rl™s 
school, I suppose, in wherever they lived. Oh 
my -- my grandfather had been the commander of 
Colmar, Alsatian Colmar, which then was Germa
n, which as a consequen -- which had a cra -- 
had a confer -- consequence. About 20 years afte
r this past wa r, let™s say in 1965 or so, the 
French governme nt offered French citizenship to my mother. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, which was very nice, but my mother
 said, no, I™m 80 years old, you know, I mi ght as 
well stay who I am and where I am. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
6 
 
 
A: But she felt very muc h like li -- very Alsatian
 and spoke French with 
a strong Alsatian accent, 
which is funny. And from there he went to anothe
r military g-garrison in Silesia and finally to 
Potsdam and in Potsdam it was time for the girls.
 After school my mother had -- had finishing 
school, one year in a fini
shing school in Geneva.  
Q: So this was a finishing school in 
order to be it -- to come  out -- 
A: Presentable, right. 
Q: -- and -- oh, uh-huh. 

A: I mean, her knowledge of things, be it mathematic
s, or -- or history, forget about it. She was -- 
and that -- that led to her debut 
before -- be fore the emperor, a
nd that was ma ndatory. Otherwise, 
you -- she would never catch a husband. And so, 
you know, th -- how they ma naged, with their 
meager income, it was at that time meager because
 my -- my grandfather ha
d to retire at age 55 
because during a hunt, a hunter has mi staken his h
ead for a ha re, and put a load of what do you -- 
what do you call the BB gun -- 
Q: Buckshot?  Oh. 
A: -- BB in there, which he was 
not mortally wounded, but to get al
l the little pieces out of his 
scalp was impossible, so he could never wear a 
steel helmet again. A general without a helmet?  
Unthinkable. So he had to retire
 and live off a me ager pension. They had just barely enough to 
eat and so did the ba -- the servants, you know
, the life without food wa
s thinkable, but not 
without servants. And then the --
 my mother was taken to that wonderful ba -- ball of the year, 
and was pres -- officially presented to the ma jest
ies, and then other balls -- dances, followed, 
during which she me t her first husba
nd. Erich Baron von Hornstein, and -- 
Q: And is that when she become s a baroness? 

A: No, no, no, she had been a baroness. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
7 
 
 
Q: Okay, she™s a baroness anyway? 
A: I -- only -- only -- only noble -- no -- people of nobility were invited there, othe rs di d not 

exist.  

Q: Exist, ri ght. 

A: Of course the -- the -- there was the so-ca
lled briefadle, which was the -- ma ny of t hose which 
the Kaiser bestowed upon a person with great me
rits. But those were people that were looked 

down upon, of course. 

Q: Yeah, because they were not true  nobility. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And a mong my ancestors is not a single bourgeo
is, not a single one. I mean, as far as we can 
go back, you know? 

Q: Right. It™s all nobility [indecipherable] 
A: All nobility because they
 didn™t meet anybody else.  
Q: Yeah. So how did your mother
 meet your father?  Do you know? 
A: Oh absolutely, my father and my mother -- of
 course, he wa s old nobili
ty too [indecipherable] 
Q: Yes.  
A: And they -- 

Q: But not quite as old. 

A: Not quite as old, but that was, you know -- 

Q: Didn™t --  that di dn™t matter. 

A: That didn™t, no, no, you know. And they me t socially in Potsdam. He was a very outstanding 

young officer. He had been put in military school with
 all his brothers at 
age eight, and that was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
8 
 
 
a brutal education for this very sensitive boy. An
d he knew one thing, never mi nd what his father 
wanted, or what his --  hi s -- the pl ans that he ha
d made for him, he will not enter the military as a 
-- choose the military as a career. His aim was become a diplomat and at a very young age, he 

became the adjutant  of the then Reichschance
llor von Bethma nn-Hollweg. And in that capacity 
he -- he -- for instance, he took -- he took the decl
aration of war to the Kaiser personally to be 
signed. And he had -- he was a very promis
ing young ma n who had probably become  a vi -- 

finance mi s -- mi nister or something 
like that. And then the wa r ended. 
Q: And we™re talking World Wa r 
1
, of course. 
A: World War 
1
, of course. And my -- my brother and hi
s -- my -- my father and his brothers 
went to war, and they all die -- they were all ki
lled except my father, who had a terrible, terrible 
shrapnel wound right above the eye -- the ear, the left 
ear. And spent a year or
 so in military -- in 
military hospitals. Wa s operated on under brutal ci
rcumstances. And then he came home , and he 

found a mother who had, you know, who had been 
a proud woma n with her beautiful four boys, 
and her -- her husband, a general for a husband. She 
was completely broken, of course, and ma  -- 
and my grandfather, not as a consequence of th
at, but soon after the war, was hospitalized with 
what probably was Alzheime r, and 
he -- he lost his mi nd and he di
ed be -- six months before I 
was born, to be his first grandchi
ld. That was tragic. And my  father™s family, they were all 
military. And -- and his grandfather was not only a ge
neral too, of course, but he was the -- in the 
cabinet of the duke -- of the Duke
 of Meklinburg, which was one of
 the states in Germany before 
the unification in 1917. But th -- and he was high
ly regarded, but the -- 
the -- the duke forgot 
some thing very important which he did with othe
r people, to give him 
an estate for -- you know, 
as a thank you. So he was -- he was receiving a 
pension and there was no
 money there. And -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

Q: So if nobility are not necessa
rily wealthy, do nobility have pr
ivilege? Is there -- is there 
something that comes?  
A: Well they -- fi rst of all they think they
 are better than others, of course, yeah.  
Q: Yes, that™s a self privilege, yes. 

A: And -- and it car -- came  close to it -- close 
to serfdom in ma ny provinces. Not as badly as in 
Russia, but -- and some of them were -- were 
very, very good to their people, and I guess I 
learned from my -- my father how
 to treat people below you, always with the greatest respect. 
Never let them feel you™re in 
a bad mood, or that -- always sa
y please and tha
nk you and I still 
reme mber my father when our nanny, who was th
en a cook, when she approached a door with a 
full tray, he would jump up and open th
e door for her. And that was not -- 
Q: That was not typical? 

A: No. 

Q: Okay. 
A: Well, probably not. Not in my mo th
er™s family, they weren™t that nice. 
Q: Uh-huh. Ho -- wh-what are your 
earliest me mories as a kid?   
A: We ll, the birth of my br
other, I was two and a half. 
Q: You do reme mber? 
A: I reme mb er my br -- cl early my mo -- my brot
her, a yellow little something lying there, and I 

had not been prepared. You know, in those days 
you weren™t, because I mean, dis -- pregnancy 

was some thing very indecent. And -- but I reme mber my disappointme nt tha -- when they told 

me  the stork had already le -- had already left 
-- the stork who brought my brother had already 

left, but he left me , as a pres
ent, a huge bag of candy. And what
 came out first was a wolf-like 
red -- Li ttle Red Riding Hood 
wolf ma de of chocolate. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
10 
 
 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah, and that wa -- ma de it easier for me to accept my brother. And he is still alive. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And now I™m his younger sister, of course. 

Q: Even though you were the older sister? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. This is Everhard?  
Is -- what [indecipherable] 
A: No, that™s -- it™s Fr eiderich Wilhelm.  

Q: Freiderich, right. 

A: Freiderich Everhard -- 

Q: Is the -- is -- 

A: -- was my mother™s youngest brother. 

Q: Y-Youngest br
other, right. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And how do you remember your parents when
 you were so young?  I mean di -- were you 
close --  

A :  We l l ,  I  r e me mb e r  my  - -  my  mo t h e r
 as being almost aloof, very cool. 
Q: Cruel?  

A: Cool. 

Q: Cool. 

A: Very cool, and I never -- I cannot reme mber
 one single occasion where I sat on her lap. She 
couldn™t -- she never received love at home , so sh
e couldn™t give love to her children, which was 
tragic. She ha d a horror of me n because her father
 was -- had been after the daughters, which -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
11 
 
 
Q: Sexually. 
A: Yes. And it must have come  to a scene oncewhere my mother overheard her mother behind a 

closed door yelling, ﬁAnd if you do that once mo
re, I™m going to divorce you.ﬂ I mean, he never 
really touched them, you know, 
but it came pretty close.  

Q: So how did you find out about this? 

A: My mother told me. 

Q: Later? 

A: Yes, much later wh
en I would understand. 
Q: So she was afraid of her father? 

A: She was afraid of her father and in cons
equence of -- of all me n, including God. She was 
afraid of God. She could deal with Je
sus Christ, but not with God hi ms elf. 
Q: Did you ever see her be aff
ectionate with your father?   
A: I don™t think once. Not even once. She wa
s affectionate with my little brother. 
Q: She was? 

A: Yes, and of course that ma de it very hard for me  --  

Q: For you. 

A: -- because I -- I was always told how home ly I 
was. I had very little hair, the hair came late, 
and I was spindly little legs, 
you know, fresh. And I once overheard a 
terrible thing, which I -- at 
the time I couldn™t really
 interpret. Behind a -- a paravol, 
I overheard, in some body else™s house, 
people talking and si -- once one lady said 
to, was it her husband, saying, ﬁUnbelievable, that 
child and this beautiful mother?  Those poor people.ﬂ So that was me . 

Q: So you grow up feeling unattractive? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
12 
 
 
A: Unattractive and that lasts for quite a l
ong time, until I found out at age 18 that I had 
something that my mother didn™t ha
ve. And that was called sex appeal. 
Q: Right. Now how did your father
 ma ke you feel since you were 
much c l oser to him, yes? 
A: My f -- fa -- father, as soon as he was home
 I climbed on his lap and he kissed me  and Sunday 
mornings, I™ll --  I™ll sit at the f
oot of his bed and for -- for -- fo
r -- for hours he would tell me  
stories, and never wo -- I would have done -- 
have been in my mother™s bed, unthinkable. 
Q: Now, did they sleep in separate rooms? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: This was -- this was what was done? 

A: That was -- yeah, that was done in our circles. 
Most of them slept in different room, but with 
door open so my father can -- could come  and he lp
 my father. My father suffered from the most 
terrible nightmares. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Not only as far as the past was concerned, bu
t it always ended with a horribly -- with this 
hoarse voice he™d say, ﬁThey are 
comi ng for me , they are comi ng fo
r me .ﬂ ﬁSie holen mi ch, sie 
holen mi ch.ﬂ Well, one day they came. 
Q: And it was -- and do you think at that 
point he was thinking of the Nazis? 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Very definitely. 

Q: So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
13 
 
 
A: And I was very surprised when I -- to find out
 some day that other peopl
e™s fathers didn™t have 
these nightma res. They didn™t yell 
out at night, he woke up the whol
e house. It happened at least 
once a week. 
Q: It was that loud? 

A: It was the past that -- 

Q: And would you run into his room? 

A: No, no, I knew my mo -- 

Q: You wouldn™t? So your mother -- 

A: But I would -- I would get up 
at times because I heard my mother tryi ng to comfort  him.  
Q: I see. 

A: And to wake him up and all that.  

Q: Right. 

A: But it was taken for gr anted. 
Q: Do you -- a-as you look back, as a young person, not
 as a -- not when you were a teenager or 
older than that, did you think that they had a 
good ma rriage, or was this
 not what one thought 
about very much? 
A: Yes, I thought it was. They never fought, they 
were very respectful to -- to one another, but 
there was no -- no tenderness -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- no -- no, it wasn™t -- just some how -- I -- 
I could compare because th
 -- I-I adopted a family 
in the neighborhood. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I talked about -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
14 
 
 
Q: Ditte, your friend. Ditte -- or Ditte. 
A: Ditte. 

Q: Ditte. 

A: She is still alive. 

Q: Really? 

A: And Ditte™s mother was Jewish. Of course, 
in those days denying she was, she looked like -- 
you would s -- notice it right away. But they had 
a regular Jewish fa mily life, wonderful. And 
they adopted me , and I really 
-- you know, from a certain age on, from age nine and 10 on, was 
never anything but politics discusse
d at the di nner tabl e. The atmo
sphere was grave at home , if 
not black. And we grew up without supervision, t
oo, you know my mother could -- we were sent 
out into the street, I was a regular
 little Berlin street girl, unusual
 for our circles, very unusual. 
And -- but home, my home was with the 
Nickel family, really. The Nickels. 
Q: So when did you f -- when did that start? 
A: That started -- we -- we ente
red --  we entered the lyceum, the 
high school together at age -- I 
was nine, Ditte was 10. 
Q: So that™s when that started? 

A: That™s when that started, yes. 

Q: But now all through -- all through your ch
ildhood -- the Nazis don™t take over until ™33. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But there™ s a lot of ferment in Germany -- 

A: But there was -- 

Q: -- and a lot of [indecipherable] 

A: -- yeah, there wa -- the -- the -- he was co -- Hitler was comi ng. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
15 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: I reme mb er a scene in a nearby st reet, the st
reet on which Martin Niemoeller lived, and the -- 
and the -- the -- the St. Anne™s
 church was on that. One Sunday the SR -- the SR was ma rching 
outside, singing, chanting, you know, howling one. And 
I looked -- I said to my father, ﬁ Who are 
they? ﬂ  And my father s -- it must have been in 
™32. And my father said, ﬁWell, that™s a terr ible 
gang, and -- and,ﬂ -- and I said to him, ﬁ Why -- w
ho allows them to do that? ﬂ  ﬁWell, th-that™s 
their leader.ﬂ And I said and what was going to 
happen, and he said, ﬁWell he -- he wants to be 
the -- the head of the German governme nt, and if
 he ever comes to power,ﬂ -- I said, ﬁWhat -- 
what will happen then?ﬂ And he said, ﬁMay God he
lp us all.ﬂ So I reme mber that , I™ ve never 
forgotten. They did that in front of th
e church, to -- to di
stur b the services. 
Q: In Dahlem?  

A: In Dahlem. That already -- 

Q: Right. You moved there -- 
A: -- we had -- we had moved to Dahlem, yeah. 
Q: -- a number of years before. So 
ag-again, a little bit pri -- prio
r to the ™32 and ™33, is it a very 
religious home  that you grew up in? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. There was prayer at lunch. 

Q: And you all ate lunch together? 

A: My mother -- 

Q: Father? 

A: -- and my -- no, my father was -- worked an hour away. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
16 
 
 
Q: Oh, I see. 
A: He was then in the same  pos -- in the position 
with the Hohenzollerns, the keeper of the privy 
-- purse, you know, the -- under a ru
ling monarch that would have b
een finance mi nister. And he 
took care -- admi nistered the -- one 
of the biggest fortunes not only in Ge rmany, but in the world. 
After the Kaiser abdi cated and f 
-- not went, but fled to Holland. 
Q: Right. 

A: The German government took everything from 
hi m. But  some how things went large -- long 
trains went to Holland, where he had sought an
d received asylum. He 
received all his -- his 
personal belongings and -- and also his ma ny, ma ny estates. 

Q: Really? 

A: They were all back to his name there. 

Q: So your -- and your father
 is taking care of all this? 
A: My father is -- not only admi nistered the money, but ma de a lot of mo ney for them. The 
Hohenzollern -- Hohenzollern fami l y though, were 
imbeciles. Really. He did -- my father was 
not a monarchist. My father coul
dn™t ta -- stand the Hohenzolle
rns, who took advantage of him 
whenever possible. But he loved 
this old, old, conf
used old ma n.  
Q: Really? 
A: Who had caused so much trouble in the world, 
but would never admit to it. Never one word. 
And who wa s easily influenced. Whe n the Nazis 
came he had rema rried. Re ma rried a princess, a 
widowed princess with four children, of -- two sons and two daughters, Pr incess of Schoenaich-

Carolath, and who was 30 some  years younger than
 he, and he fell in love, you know. His first 
wife, the Empress Auguste, who must have been an
 angel, she loved him. And she died literally 
of a broken heart after he went to Holland. And th
en he soon, within two years he was rema rried

and lived in his golden cage, and 
my father had his own apartment there, of course, and went -- 
stayed with him, I woul d say, an
 average of a week a month.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And whe n him -- when my father left him,
 he had talked reason to him, you know, but he 
always knew, as soon as he turns his back, the old ma n woul d -- 

Q: Wi sh -- good -- would go back. 

A: -- fall prey to any bad influence. Poor ma n. 

Q: Yes. 

A: He had a hard life, you know, growing up with 
wa -- only one arm, the other one crippled. For 
a Prussian, for a future emperor, he had hells on wheels. 

Q: Hm. We have to stop 
the tape and change it.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: When does Anna come into your life as
 a housekeeper?  Or wh
at is she, actually? 
A: I -- I came into Anna™s life, so to say. Anna
 -- when my -- my father and my mother got 
married, they got in touch with je -- with each ot
her while my mother was in the sa nitorium for 
her lung di sease and my father was in a military hospital. Some how a correspondence began. 
Q: Really? 

A: And one reme mbered the other, and they really
 fell in love over -- they
 must have -- over the 
letters, because they already got -- he got out 
of the military and they ma rried in Ma y of 1919. 
My sister wa s always -- half sist
er was six months -- six years old. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then was the question what wa s he going to 
do with his life. He had -- he ra -- was a very 

good looking man, he had had his military -- military
 academy education, which I me an for those 
years were -- was a pretty good one
. He was right away spotted as a very special -- very special 
ma n with a talent for finances. We ll, they got
 ma rried and even though they had hardly enough 
to eat, they had to have a 
servant who would cook. And -- 
Q: Your mother didn™t go in
to the kitchen, of course. 
A: Oh, would sh -- well, first of
 all they -- they asked around in
 Potsdam a nd Anna™s name  was 
given to them. She was -- Anna was born in 
-- in the 1980 -- 18 -- 1887, so she was already, you 
know, not very young for those days any more, and sh
e was -- her -- her family, also noble, her 
fa mily, von Massel -- I call them Sht r aylo in my 
-- in my book, I believe. There were, due to the 
circumstances there was nothing to 
eat, it was dismal circums t ances. They moved to one of their 
estates, they had an estate. So Anna could pi
ck, you know, and she took one look at my mother 

and said this lady is not goi
ng to interfere with my housek
eeping, you know. She was right. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
19 
 
 
no children, thank goodness. So she accepted for -- for, I mean, peanuts for pay, the position. My 
mother -- my mother and father had been assigned
 an ap -- mi serable apartment, which is still 
standing in Potsdam facing a co
al supply firm, a nd it was all 
windows going to the north, and 
there were -- was a bit we t, and but you -- what c
ould they do?  And that™s where I began my start 
in life. And when Anna heard 
that a baby was on the way, she se
riously considered leaving. But 
then on the other hand, you know, ma ybe my mother had 
no interest -- as little
 interest in a child 
than she had for the household. She stayed, watche
d me  being born and I was her baby. From the 
first day on, I grew up on Anna™s arms, and all th
e tenderness that I didn™t 
get from my mother, I 
got from Anna. 

Q: So Anna became a kind of mother figure -- 

A: Absol -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- and still -- I still, when I think of mo
therhood and -- and of being on some body™s lap, there 
is Anna, holding me  tight like a -- like a gori
lla holding her young, Anna. She would not even 
share -- share her with my mother. This -- when my mother three years later, two and a half years 

later, gave birth to my brother, she 
decided she™d let her keep that baby. 
Q: So in some  ways, Anna kept you 
from your mother, at a certain point. 
A: We ll, though, she didn™t have a hard time  keeping -- 

Q: Keeping you, I see. 

A: Yeah, yeah, of course. 

Q: Explain to me  what you mean by an apartmen
t was assigned to your parents. Who assigned 
it? 

A: It was assigned, there was a housing office -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
20 
 
 
Q: I see. 
A: -- because of the terrible shortage, 
like there was during the war -- Wo rld War 
11
, and after 
World War 
11
 -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- where you had a va -- you had a right to cert
ain space and -- and that™s what they had to 
take, whether they liked it -- it wa
s either that apartment or none. 
Q: Right. Now tell me  some thing, Anna is nobilit
y, but she™s working as a housekeeper. Now, is 
this odd? Or is it -- 

A: Wait -- what -- what  -- whose -- 

Q: Anna. Anna you said had an -- es
tates, her family. Or a m I wrong? 
A: Yeah, Anna came from the Vendish tribe. 

Q: Right. 

A: A Vendish tribe, and a very proud
 tribe, and the girl s were all sent
 to work with -- to work in 
households. 

Q: I see, I see. 

A: They couldn™t do anything else , th -- they ha
d, according to German laws, which applied to 

them, learn German and -- and attend school until 14. But Anna would not have gone to a 

bourgeois family. First position she had at age 
14 was with nobility and later my parents. 

Q: And why is that, because the ven -- 

A: A beca -- 

Q: -- because of wu -- of the group th
at she comes from?  The particul -- 
A: No, I don™t -- she identified he
rself so much with our family 
that y -- or later too, very few 
non-nobility people came into our house, and they ha
d to ma ke up for their terrible lack by titles 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
21 
 
 
like your Excellency, stuff like that. Or doctor, 
you know. But Anna knew th -- those were her 
circles, you know. 
Q: Hm. When you start going to school -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Well, let™s --  

A: Well -- 

Q: -- let™s mo -- move up. When do you 
first go to school, when you™re six? 

A: When I was six, I we nt -- of course, we were 
much too sn-snobbish a -- to -- snob is not a ver 
-- g -- good word, by the way, a -- but ma inly thanks
 to Anna, her child would not attend a public 
school. So we -- th -- my parents joined ot
her parents and they founded a school in the 
neighborhood, it took place in one ro
om, and there were -- for the 
first three years of my life 
there was one teacher who had been retired, he came
 out of re tirement. He  taught us all, we were 

about 12 children. That was neat, 
that was neat. And then we -- ev
en though I was so small and -
- and I was sick very often, my parents insisted
 on me  entering the so
-called high school, the 
higher school, not at age 10, but at
 age nine. Which of course, as 
a consequence, I -- I was left 
behind when I was 13. 

Q: In order to join up with the 
other kids, or because you weren™t -- 
A: Because I was not -- 

Q: You weren™t ready. 

A: -- not ma ture enough. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
22 
 
 
A: And th -- that -- that school
 was just around the corner from 
us in Dahlem, we had moved to 
Dahlem, renting a beautiful house on the same  
street where we  would later in 1932 and ™33, 
would build our own townhouse. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But you also said that that becamea neighborhood where a lot of Nazis -- 

A: It was a n -- 

Q: -- lived, or least some . 

A: -- a neighborhood where a lot 
of non-Nazis lived, but among 
the populati -- and film stars, 
movie stars lived there. But a lot of the hi
ghest Nazis -- Himmler had his house around the 
corner, the Minister of Economy, 
the Minister of Education, 
Woost, economy was Starrer. 
Goebbels was out in Wa nnsee. Oh yes, a lot of
 it was -- you know, all th
ese beautiful villas 
where Jews had lived, that Jews had -- had built,
 had worked for, when they were expelled, 
before being dis -- de ported and killed, those villas were taken by the Nazi s and high military 

people. You know, I had one Brauchitsch, Gene
ral Field Marshall -- Fi
eld Marshall Walter von 
Brauchitsch, a cousin of my mo
ther™s, who was Chief of Staff of
 the German arme d for c es, of 
the German army. And he lived in one of these 
big villas, and was -- he had been a me mber of 
the Nazi party, with the golde
n bird. And even though he live
d, walking, ma ybe seven mi nutes 
away, I not ever in my life set eyes on him.
 My father would not allow anyone even faintly 
resembling -- faintly connected with the Nazis, 
he would not allow it, but
 my mother was -- was 
my mother™s brother in a -- in 
-- a young o -- an older brother, of
 course, he joined the SR and 
the party. And you -- he didn™t -- didn
™t come  to the house after that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
23 
 
 
Q: Did your mother keep connections with the 
people who had connections
 with the Nazis, or 
were -- di d she join with her father -- 
A: No, no, no, she joined -- 

Q: -- or was it -- with her husband? 

A: -- absolute -- absolutely, yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And on the other hand there was the other br
other of my mother, w
ho ma rried a Jewish lady 
from -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- from Russia, originally. 

Q: Now, when you first moved to Dahlem -- I d
on™t mean when you were two and a half, when 
you [indecipherable] you wouldn™t -- 

A: No, to -- to -- to Dahl
em, I moved at age six. 
Q: At age six? 

A: Yes. To -- from Potsdam to Berlin -- 

Q: Ah, at age two and a half. 

A: -- at age two and a half. 

Q: Right, okay. So when you were six. 

A: When I was six we moved. That makes it 19
29. We moved t -- to Dahlem, had that rented 
house. 

Q: Now, do you reme mb er having Jewish fr
iends as well as non-Jewish friends? 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: The neighborhood is quite mi xed, then? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
24 
 
 
A: Th-The school was -- yeah, my class was -- wa
s -- was full of Jewish girls, and one by one 
they disappeared. But except for my dear, dear, 
dear friend Anita Frank, who was -- they were -- 
she and her brother were already orphaned at 
the time, she died in Bergen-Belsen. Reinhardt 
made it out of -- of Auschwitz
, they all reached safety. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. For a very simple fact. Not only were 
the parents well informed, but they had a lot of 
money. 

Q: Money. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And they could get out. 

A: Right. 

Q: So they got out early. 

A: That™s why I never, except for once in Berlin
 during the day I saw an 
open truck loading Jews 
from house -- from a Jew house. Otherwise these si ghts were not -- you know, I was not familiar 

with that sight, because even if they had co
me  for them, you know, with the wide spaces in 
between the houses, nobody would have known. 

Q: Did your father explain to you when people we
re leaving, why they were leaving, or were you 

reading the newspapers when you were nine or
 10 years old? I mean, wha t  did you know? 
A: No, I wa -- I reme mb er his growing interest 
when I said well, Ellen 
Ginsburg, or Alice Levy, 
or wa -- and he said, ﬁThey™re Jewish? ﬂ  And I 
said yes. And behind that question was always, 
what can we do for them?  That ha -- that happened
 very, very early. I reme
mber the fi rst inci dent 
at school where I didn™t even notice it, but my 
fat her imme diately did, where we handed little 
for ms indicating what religion 
we were, you know?  Name , and -- 
and re -- what religion the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
25 
 
 
parents were. And -- and what 
-- what heritage and all that
, I reme mber. Suza -- Suzi Levy, 
Susannah Levy, si -- Ellen Levy, si
tting behind me  and showed me  he
rs, and that said, we hereby 
testify that so and so is of purely Jewish bac kground. It was the wa -- death verdict for them, you 
know?  And I didn™t -- I didn™t find 
anything wrong with it, I thought
 that goes with school, they 
want to know. Boy, did they ever want to know. And then, you know, by -- by -- of course, I was 

taken out of that school, and by the time I was ta
ken out in 1937, there we
re still -- even though 
there were Je wish schools in Berlin, there were 
still some  Jewish girl s in my class. And by the 
time I came back in 1939, there were -- I don
™t know, all left, they were all gone.  
Q: Right. 

A: And I don™t have the f -- I was not a go -- ve
ry good friend with the exception to Anita and 
she in ™41 once rang our doorbell, you know. She™d 
been told that we were okay, and Anita I™ve 
never forgotten. She -- 

Q: She was alone with her brother, her mother had been able to -- 
A: She wa -- her f -- her -- her 
-- she lived in -- they lived in
Dahlem. How much mo ney they 
had, I never knew. Very, very much. The moth
er, widowed mother, can you imagine such a 
thing, left the children. Anita 
was then 16 or so, and the br
other nine, alone to fend for 
themselves. She left for Switzerland to ma rry a 
ma n, in the hope that she would dr -- get the 
children, too. That mother must not have been te
rr ibly br ight  according to what Reinhardt says. 
Q: No. Yeah. 
A: And of c ourse they moved one -- from one r e lati
ve to the other, from 
one Jewish school to the 
other, until a fa -- she fina lly -- were both fina
lly caught by the -- by the Nazis and she became a 

nurse, a nurse™s aide -- she wanted to be a mi dwife. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
26 
 
 
A: A nurse™s aide in the Jewish hospital, 
and took her brother an -- who was then 12, and 
allegedly av -- an -- a electricians assi stant, and 
they -- they -- they lived
 there in the hospital, 
and one day -- and that™s when Anita came to vi
sit. And Anita, I said, ﬁWhat about going into 
hiding? ﬂ  You know, and we ha -- gonna -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and she said, ﬁNo, I can™t do 
it because of my brother, he 
looks so Jewish.ﬂ We ll Anita had 
looked like a country girl, you 
know, coffa -- kinky hair and br
own eyes, and like a -- like an 
apple. And the little -- little 
Reinhardt, no, and she of cour
 -- felt responsible for him, 
Switzerland. And he told her, af
ter I found him again in New York a few years ago, he told me  
that he was beseeching her to try and go across 
the -- the border illegally
 to Switzerland. And he 
said, ﬁWa -- wa -- all they can do is shoot us.ﬂ
 Because that little boy knew, obviously, and -- 
and she said no -- she wa s too Prussian, you know?  N
o, no, things will -- wi -- wi -- will work 
out, and they were first sent to Theresienstadt
. And Theresienstadt, oh th
ere were -- they were 
reported to the Gestapo, you know, because they -- th
eir position was somehow half legal. To the 
Gestapo, they are both deported to -- to Theresie
nstadt by a ma n by the name  of Got t schalk, a 
Jewish spy of which Berlin was full.
 R e me mb e r  w h a t ™ s  h e r  na me ,  S t e l l a ?  
Q: Stella, yeah. 

A: Stella -- 

Q: I forget her last name , but Stella -- 

A: Gottschalk [indecipherable] 
Stella -- Stella Gottschalk. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
27 
 
 
A: They both sent to Theresienstadt, and ther
e they lived like everybody else, vegetated in the 
stadt -- in the city that
 the Führer had given the Jews, for 
-- meant for 3,000 people, and I think 
they had 45 in there. But you know, th
ere were transports to -- to -- 
Q: To Auschwitz? 
A: -- to Auschwitz all the time, and one day it wa
s -- no, but I have to stop here, because a few 
weeks after they had appeared in Theresiens
tadt, who come s? Herr Go
ttschalk. His fate had 
caught up with him. And Reinhardt spotted hi
m r i ght away, and took -- wa s invited for a 

conference among the Jews, what shall we do with 
him?  He deserves the death penalty, but he 
didn™t go to the -- he were -- they executed him. 
They were working -- Reinhardt was working in 
a chemical cleaners -- at a chemical clean 
-- for the SS you know, and they threw him in a 

cleaning ma chine.  

Q: Really? 

A: And whe n he came out he was very clean, but quite dead.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: And then he was -- Re inhardt was selected 
and put on the train for 
Auschwitz, and the last 
thing Anita said to him -- and that tells you how 
naïve she wa s, he said when you arrive -- she 
said, ﬁWhen you arrive there, tell them you are 
only 11 and very sickly.ﬂ Had he followed her 
advice -- 

Q: Right, he would have been -- 

A: -- they would have sent him to the gas chamber. On the train he was told to say he was 17 and 

a learned -- and -- 
and a electrician. 
Q: Right. 

A: And that™s how he eventually -- a
nd that™s a story by itself, survived.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

Q: When the Nazis take over, and there is a 
boycott and then there is
 a book burning in 1933, are 
you conscious of this?  You™re -- 
A: And how. 

Q: You are? 

A: And oh, every detail of it. 
It was -- it was -- you know, by th
at time, Martin Niemoeller had 
already entered our family -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- who was very naïve, and thanks to -- thanks
 to my father mainly, 
I -- I like to think, he 
finally, when it hit home , he -- within a few months he was -- he was cured.  

Q: Because he was not against na tio
nal socialism at first, at all? 
A: No, no, no. And he decided it would be good for 
the volken, whatever, and he -- he voted for 
Hitler in 1933 -- 

Q: Right, right. 
A: -- some thing unthinkable for my parents.  
Q: And you meet hi m be cause he™s 
the pastor of the church, yes? 

A: I was the first of the family to meet him, because we™ve had a very, very nice ol d Pastor 

Lange, and Pastor Lange was supposed to retire. A
nd I think we went there for Christma s and for 
Easter, that was about the amount
 of time my -- my parents spen
t in a church. And then my 
father heard there was a new pa
stor and that was the time he 
decided that his daughter should 
start going to Sunday school. And I a
ttended the very first service Ma
rtin Niemoeller ever held in 
Dahlem. 

Q: Really?  Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
29 
 
 
A: And I -- I had been taken there against my will, because  I had a hockey game  that day. They 
were always held on Sundays, much to my father
™s chagrin. So he took me -- he dragged me , and 
-- and handed me  over physically to one of the 
ushers, and I sat in th
e front -- front aisle. 
Q: In the pew? 

A: Pew, in the front, pew, and decided to behave
 as outrageously as possible, sticking my tum -- 
tongue out, and -- and I was full of freckles, 
you know, looking as unkempt as possible, even 
though I™d been forced to take a bath before. 
And there come s  this good looking -- with our old, 
white haired Pastor Lange, come s that good looki
ng, slender, very dark ma n, he had pitch black 
hair. Ver -- olive complexion, otherwise he remi nde
d me  of my father. And then he started to 
talk to us children, not about Jesus or v -- the 
Virgin Mary or anythi
ng, but about his time in 
World War 
1
 as a submarine commander.  
Q: This was his first sermon? 

A: That -- very wise, because everybody was liste
ning. And I decided I woul
d love that ma n. But 
I didn™t let -- know of -- anybody of the fa mily know
. I came home and I dis -- my father I felt 
deserved punishme nt for -- for forcing me  to go 
there, and my father asked, ﬁOh, how was it? ﬂ  
Oh, oh, was okay. ﬁWho -- how was the new pastor
? ﬂ  Oh, he™s okay, you know. ﬁAnd what did 
he talk about, what™s his name ? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI 
don™t know.ﬂ I knew darn well, you know. But as time 
progressed, my parents went over 
to his house and I -- they came to
 our house, and I decided to 
try the Niemoeller children, but a 
mi nister™s children are notorious for being pious, and ha! Did I 
meet a bunch?  Six children with a -- three of 
them black, like the father, and three of them 
blonde with blue eyes like the mother, and gorgeous 
children. And I fit in like
 th-the runt of the 
litter, you know? 

Q: The runt of the litter. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
30 
 
 
A: Absolutely, and I -- I lived in there and ro
amed around the vast parsonage, and there was -- 
that house was so noisy, you wouldn™t believe this
 -- once in awhile the door would open, and 
the pastor, with a stentoric vo
ice would ask for -- for -- would dema nd silence, otherwise he 
would come  and clobber us all. And the children 
all say, ﬁHe always says, he never does it,ﬂ you 
know. That was my first -- my first visit with
 Martin Niemoeller. 
Little did I know -- 
Q: Little did you know. 

A: -- that  I was to be -- 

Q: So you were how old when you first -- 

A: I-I was nine. 

Q: Nine. 

A: Or even eight. Th
at  was before -- 
Q: And he must have been in his -- 

A: He was -- he was 33 years older than I -- 
Q: Three -- right, right. 
A: -- figure it out. Yeah. He wa
s born in ™92, I was born in -- 

Q: Born in ™23. 

A: -- ™23, yeah. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Thirt -- 32 years old. And then I soon asked my 
parents to spare me  that experience of -- of -- 
of children™ s services, but let me go with 
them. Now they started going to church. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: As soon as the Confessing Church was founded
 by him, they -- and soon as I had been -- had 
been confirme d, I became a me mb
er -- we became member -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
31 
 
 
Q: Of the Confessing Church? 
A: -- of the Confessing Church, ye
s. And now, in my eyes, I mean 
he was an endangered species 
of course, because I va -- Frau Niemoeller came a
ll the time and told me the Gestapo had called, 
they had sear ched the house and all that. So I deci ded when the Gestapo come s, I will save hi s 

life. So I went to Woolworth -- and I got a 
very meager amount of money each week and bought 
a chain and a lock, with which I was going to --
 what™s the English word?  The Gestapo i --  
Q: You -- yo -- 

A: -- keeping him -- keeping them fr om -- from -- 

Q: Getting him?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oh, you were going to lock him up, or you we
re going -- no, you were going to lock -- 
A: No, I was going to lock the Gestapo up. 

Q: I see. 
A: Yeah, yeah, I was not modest in my exp -- but it never happened. 
Q: Never happened, right. You didn™t have that chance. 

A: But I heard every one of his -- of his sermons.  

Q: How old were you when you were confirme d?  What is the age? 

A: I was 15. 

Q: 15. 

A: He was in the con -- I had hoped, while in 
boarding school, 14 - 15, that by the time  I ca me  
out, he would be able to c
onfirm me , but no such thing. 
Q: But he wasn™t -- right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
32 
 
 
A: So his -- his successor or hi 
-- rather his -- his -- yeah, [indeci
pherable] Hel mut Gollwitzer, he 
confirme d me  in his stead. 
Q: Right. 

A: By that time I had already witnessed Kristallnacht. 

Q: Yes. 

A: In Eberswalde. 

Q: Right. Well let™s -- let™s go b
ack just -- just a little bit he
re. When you™re going to school, and 
there are Nazi kids, th
is is after ™33 -- 
A: Well, yeah, well ther e was -- 

Q: Why did you hit Ribbentrop™
s daughter?  What happened? 
A: Because she™d been fr esh to me, an I reme mber s -- I had to climb on a -- on the bench in 

order to reach her because  she was so big. 

Q: You slapped her across the face? 
A: I slapped her across her stupid 
face. She was a nice girl, really. 
Q: She was? 
A: But we -- but that, it was pers
onal, that really was personal. 
Q: That wasn™t political. 

A: Bettina von Ribbentrop, and my
 father was so proud of me. 
Q: Yes. Wh at did the teacher do when you did that? 

A: Teacher was not in the room. He  was -- it
 was in dur -- during intermission, you know, 
something like that. 

Q: Over recess. And what -- and Scho
lz-Klink™s daughters we re there too? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
33 
 
 
A: Both -- God, I completely forgot that. 
Both daughters of Madame  Sc holz-Klink, the 
Reichsfrauenfuehrerin, she attended -- was in my -- they were in my class, in the same  
classroom. I solde, and I don™t reme mber the name  of 
the other. We ll, with them you really had to 
be careful. And the children -- 

Q: Excuse me .  

A: -- of -- of -- of Himml e r, the daughter of 
Himmler, Gudrund -- Gudrund, of course, she was a 
few years younger. And the children of Woost, two 
daughters, they were also in another grade, 
but you w -- w -- I saw them every day. They were
 -- they ma naged to get a teacher fired, but 
fortunately he did not end up in 
a concentration camp, the best teacher the school had. They told 

daddy about a few rema r ks he had made, daddy 
took care of them. It was -- you know, what I 
learned at home  was to keep my
 mouth shut outside. You know, 
I was a blabbermouth, but not in 
these things. And I was revolting ag
ainst -- rebelling against my pa
rents except in that one field. 
And so what I was taught -- I always say that, 
was the meaning of conspirative behavior, very 
early. I mean, Jewish families can talk about their 
children learning it at a 
-- at a very early age. 
And the -- the meaning of your own 
conscience, how very, very important that was, that intact 
conscience. Never do u -- or -- 
o-or say anything that you mi ght not
 be able to sleep at night. 
And that was key in both life, for me it was norma l, was nothing. And I had Ditte, of course. 
Q: And she was at that school? 

A: Ditte was next to me  always. We  were a f
eared duo. But she had to be much more careful 
because of he r Jewish mother. What they left, that
 could only be done in -- in Dahlem, in Berlin. 
They left a very quiet life. The children, they 
didn™t even have pia
no lessons, nothing, you know?  
They lived the Jewish fa mily life, and that™s how
 Ditte™s mother survived. With her looks, to me 
still a mystery.

Q: We ™re going to have to change the tape, so -- 
A: Already? 

Q: Yes. 
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Okay. I will -- I -- I am going to ask you in a 
mi nute about some thing that you di d with a ka -- 
with Kaiser Wilhel m, but I want to ask you, b
ecause you just ended talking about what you were 
taught at home  about being at school. I imagine ther
e is -- there are Nazi fl ags up, or there is a lot 
of -- you have to -- di d you have to s -- s -- do th
e heil Hitler in the mor ning when the teacher 
comes in? 
A: Not yet. That came as time went on. The fi
rst years -- few years, it was Gut Morgen. 
Q: Really? 

A: And -- yes, and I don™t reme mber the exact poin
t in -- during which th
at wer -- heil Hitler was 
introduced. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But even by the way, a teacher would greet th
e class with a German salute, you knew whether 
the -- she -- it was only female te -- no, no, we ha
d two ma le teachers, wh
ether they were Nazis 
or not. I -- I knew why, you know. I was brought up with
 that six and seventh and eighth sense, 
and which has led me  through my life, by -- 

Q: So what did -- what did you me a n when you sa
id what your -- your -- 
y-you were clearly a so 
-- sort of a wild kid -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- or at least very devilish. 

A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: Yes? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But in this area -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
36 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- in the political area, 
you trusted what your parents 
said, and you followed them. 
A: Yeah. That™s right. Absolutely. 

Q: So were they telling you to be quiet in school? 

A: That is the most wondrous 
thing. I was never told, don™t repeat
 that outside of the house. I 
knew. I just knew. 

Q: You just knew. 

A: Yeah. Oh, by the way, that -- that -- there was 
a period of rebellion afte
r I -- in ni -- in 1933 
my father had taken us to Unter den Li nden to
 see Hindenburg and Hitler.
 And on the way back I 
reme mber my brother and I, we both decided 
to count flags hanging out of the windows. And 
when we arrived home, I had more, but that -- it 
came  out that I had counted the -- I -- th-the 

swastika flags, and my brother had counted the blac
k, white, and red. And I se
 -- I count -- I have 
more, and for that fact alone, my mother slappe
d me  across the face. Hakenkreuzfahen. You just 
never do that. And then that nigh
t I decided to become  Nazi, a
nd with the goal of eventually 
ma rrying Hitler, or becomi ng his cook.  

Q: That™s quite an idea. 

A: We ll, you know Hitler -- and even my father wa
s -- he w -- my father was so wonderful, he 
said, ﬁWell, have you ever thought about the fact
 that when Hitler™s ge
tting older, and you will 
have to wait for an awfully long time to ma rry hi
m. Why don™t you plan to be his cook? ﬂ  Okay. 
So every mo rning when he -- I came down, he sa
y, ﬁ What would you like to cook for your führer 
today?  Spinach?  Brussel sprouts?ﬂ You know, he 
was a vegetar -- so that
 period did not last 

long.  

Q: And your father didn™t -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
37 
 
 
A: No, no, no -- 
Q: -- cri -- nobody criticized you, they just let you go. 

A: -- no, not at all, he re -- he
 seemed very str -- stern, but -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- very serious about it. 

Q: Right. 

A: And then some thing happened that ma de me  
change my mi nd, not my 
parents. I was invited 
to the home of a mutual friend not
orious anti-Nazi, who had a t
ea party in her beautiful house. 
And since I often visited her, I rang the doorbell, 
and I said, ﬁCan a -- can I come  in? ﬂ  And the -- 
the servant said, ﬁNo, you can™t come in today, Fr au 
Pietschker,ﬂ -- ha -- 
was her name, ﬁshe has 
her tea party.ﬂ And sh -- there a
ppears Frau Pietschker in a beau
tiful flowered dress. And she 
says, ﬁCome  in, come  in, I want to show you to my ladies,ﬂ you know. And she had a beautiful 

oval salon, with tables like this
, and a free room in the front. Sh
e drags me -- I was in leather 
pants, you know?  No socks are on, 
just -- just sandals, not wa sh
ed, nothing. And she puts me  in 
the mi ddle of the room, a nd says, ﬁLadies, just li
sten for one mome nt. This is Ulrich von Sell™s 
daughter. She is a Nazi.ﬂ I -- I hoped the floor 
would open and swallow me because the laughter 
that followed was -- would -- I 
know it would follow me  for a lifetime, and it did. I went home 
and all the Nazi things that I™d gathered, everythi
ng with the --  with the sw
astika on it, I put in an 
old handkerchief, and carried them out to the 
garbage, but I threw them in some body else™s 
garbage. That was the end. 

Q: Now why was this the end, what
 -- what did it mean to you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
38 
 
 
A: I -- I was so -- that my father -- well, 
you know, I -- everybody knew my father, you know?  It 
was so humi liating to me , that I didn™t show mu
ch character and stood up for the man I loved. I 
joined the other side. And that was th
e brief intermission, the brief period. 
Q: Now, we re these people pro-Nazi? 

A: No, no, no, no, no. 

Q: They weren™t. And so they were laughing because -- 

A: No, that™s why they laughed. 

Q: -- they couldn™t believe it. 

A: They just could not believe it. I -- 

Q: That™s interesting. 

A: -- we never had an ow -- of course we di --we never went to Nazi™s
 houses, nor did Nazis -- 
Nazi Germa ns, as one should really say, come  to
 our house. It was just -- I -- I reme mb er we 
were good friends, one of -- last German a mbassador
 to -- Dickhoff was his name , he lived a few 
houses down the street. He came to dinner a few 
times, but then when Hitler progresse d, he was 
persona non grata. I didn™t 
even notice, but you know -- 
Q: As a kid, let™s say up to the age of 15 -- 
14 or 15, how did you understand what it wa s that 

your parents were against in terms of the Nazis?
 What -- what was it? 
Cause your father -- long 
time -- 

A: It was really -- and the -- he foresaw, years 
before Hitler came, what would happen if he came 

to power, because Hitler didn™t 
fall from the sky like a me teor, you know? He had been a -- a 
known agitator on the po
litical scene for 14 years. I was agai
nst everything that Hitler did or 
said, I didn™t specify, you know?  I -- and then of 
course, were the Jews, the Jews, the Jews. We  
had Jewish friends. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
39 
 
 
Q: Did you listen to Hitler™s speeches on the radio? 
A: No, no, no, Hitler™s speeches were not listened to
 in our house. It was on very early put on the 
BBC, and that too, my -- there my father instru
cted us, when you -- when you listen to -- found 
the station BBC, you ha -- after you turn off th
e radio -- radio entered 
our house late, in ™36 
ma ybe, you have to put the knob back to anything
 else. Sure enough, when the Gestapo came to 
the house, it was after Martin Ni
emoeller™s incarcerati
on, the first thing the f -- ma n number one 
did, go the radio and turn it on. 

Q: To see what station. 

A: Uh-huh. Was a German station. 

Q: It was a German station. 

A: Of course. 

Q: Right. Now, we can go back a little bit be
cause I know you want to tell the story about the 
Kaiser. 
A: I ca -- I have hundreds of stories. 
Q: I know you do. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But you wanted him to 
be your guardian, right? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Or your -- your -- 

A: My godfather. 

Q: -- your godfather. 

A: But you know, girls are not godchildren of th
e Kaiser. So my brother for his birthdays 
received all sorts -- is 
beautiful pla -- silver -- pure silv
er things. And I never got anything, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
40 
 
 
know, so I decided if I™d ask my -- my father w
hy da -- isn™t he  my godfather. Because that™s 
only boys, and so on. So I decided as soon as I le
arned to write -- that had noth -- something to 
do with it, I would bring about
 a situation where he couldn™
t say no. And then I thought -- I 
wrote, you know, like a child, and I addressed h
im Liebe Kaiser, dear Emperor, using no name , 
or majesty or some liebe. Some of them are -- 
one is printed in the -- in one of my books, you 
know, Liebe Kaiser, and then I -- I -- I se -- 
I didn™t really ask hi
m, but you know, I know you 
are the godfather of my brother, 
can I be -- please be your godch
ild too?  Some thing like -- and 
then I thought it would be very nice if I included a little present, 
some thing he could really use. 
And I just learned from my grandmother to croc
het, a white potholder with a red rim. And I 
enclosed that, and I put it in an envelope. And ne
xt time my father went to Holland, I said to him, 
would he please -- I trusted him, 
would he please give this to th
e Kaiser?  And my fa ther did, you 
know, vastly amused, of course. My
 -- the Kaiser was vastly amus
ed, and from then on, he sent 
me things for my birthday, but no 
silver plates or anything like th
at. A scooter. A dynamo light -- 
a dynamo light for my - -  for my -- for my bicycle, stuff like that. 

Q: So really good things? 

A: And I was conv -- I was convinced that he had 
tried out the scooter himself, you know, in the 
-- in the -- he went to the store, 
you know, and o -- did that all himself. 
Q: That™s a great story. 

A: He was -- he was -- yes, he called me  the 
little monkey. Never referred to me  by a nything 

else. But there™s a 
story behind that. 
Q: Yes, do you want to tell it? 

A: Yeah, sure. Once we had the brother of the sis 
-- my sister™s fr -- girlfriend, who was then a 
young officer, must have been in ™37 - ™38, who ca
me  to visit, not beknownst to us, and at the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
41 
 
 
table already ha -- he had develope
d Nazi ideas, and I saw my fath
er™s face grow paler and paler, 
but fortunately the young ma n had to leave right 
after -- after dinner, and I was delegated to 
accompany hi -- hi m to the -- to the underground. 
And passing Martin Niemoeller™s church, there 
was a light -- it was already dark, there was a light
 in the church, and he said, ﬁWell, this is 
Thursday evening, so what -- what™s -- what™s goi
ng on there?ﬂ And I said, ﬁ Well, those are the -
- the prayer -- the -- the 
service is held every ni ght for all the pastors in concentration camps.ﬂ 
And then he started, ﬁWhat?  That 
is a scandal. I, in a German uniform, trying to defend the,ﬂ -- 
and I was speechless, and then I looked up to hi
m and I said, ﬁYou ze affe.ﬂ ﬁYou monkey.ﬂ And 
then ran away. We  never heard from the young man 
again, fortunately. And my father told that 
story to -- to his majesty, and his majesty t
hought it was very amusing, called me  little monkey. 
Q: Little mo nkey, right. Now you ha d governesses? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And is that when you learned English, cause these were English governesses? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Th-That worked. You had a -- 

A: Three English governesses. Joy, the other on
e™s name  I don™t reme mbe r , and Nell, the third 
one. All -- w- well the last  one we kept  c
onnections until far af
ter the war, yes. 
Q: And so you learned English from them, is that right? 

A: Yeah, yes. And I had a talent for si -- for -- for -- 

Q: For languages? 

A: -- languages. And of course 
then we had a f -- a bon -- a Fr ench ma demoiselle. She couldn™t 
stand the food in the house, wh
ich was grim, you know. Prussian 
food? Forget about it. And -- 
Q: So did -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
42 
 
 
A: She couldn™t stand it. 
Q: Uh-huh. So is that why you ate a lot in Ditte™s house? 

A: Wa s always a place there for me . Yeah, sure. 

Q: You get very calm when you me ntion that 
family. You -- you felt very comfortable there. 
A: Yeah, because that wa s my rock of Gibra
ltar, you know, that was -- I was -- everybody was so 
happy to see me . I was one of their children. 

Q: So your house was a very
 serious and obviously -- 
A: Sinister, almost, you know. Y
ou opened the door and the atmo
sphere was already comi ng at 
you. It was only forebodings of -- ev
ery day it was some thing new th
at Hitler had done, or order, 
whatever. And he -- my father 
had been right in everything. 
Q: But it™s -- it™s also interesting because in th
is house that™s partially Je
wish, because the mother 
is Jewish -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- they are not as -- it™s not as 
sinister, and they ar
e more vulnerable. 
A: Oh, exactly. 
Q: Or would appear to be more vulnerable. 

A: Exactly, mo mmy -- I called 
her mo mmy. Mommy wanted -- she loved, she adored children. 
Every morning she would go to the bakery and buyheaps of -- of -- of ca
ke, just in case the 
children brought home friends, and there shoul
d be enough to eat for everybody. But in -- you 
know, then came a time when they had to, except fo
r the little boy, had to tell the three daughters 
what -- you know, th-the dangers they were in. And sh
e -- they tried to get all the children out of 
the country. They succeeded with the oldest one, 
Eve. Eve still lives in England, she™s now 86 or 
88, and it was too late for -- for the other ones 
to get out of the country. And the little boy, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
43 
 
 
Herman, that was my so- called foster brother, he
 was the fi rst German student to enter the United 
States after the war. 
Q: Really? 

A: Got a law degree, he married Phyllis Fr itchie, does the name mean anything to you? 

Q: So -- n -- 

A: He has the north -- had the North Vi
rginia Sun, or some thing, newspaper ma n. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And he was Stevenson™s campaign ma nager. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And Herman wound up as the ambassador for 
the United States under Reagan in South 
Africa. That™s a career. Bu
t we got kind of, you know -- 
Q: Now, let me a -- the -- I don™t -- I don™t know 
if -- if you can even answer this question, do 
you think your house mi ght have been severe -- y-you 
talk about a sort of Prussian atmosphere -- 
A: Severity, yeah. 

Q: -- even if there were no Nazis?  

A: Good question, I don™t think so. 

Q: You don™t think so. 

A: No, no. 

Q: You think it really was this political -- 

A: My father tended to me lancholia and to de
pression, that™s what I inherited from him.  
Q: I see. 

A: Now, thanks to mode rn me dicine, I don™t have that any more. 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
44 
 
 
A: And my mother was, you know, she was even
, and lighthearted, and -- and she mus t  have 
suffered like hell, too, you know?  Always grim moods
. And then, of course, being in the position 
he was in, whenever he was there, there were
 daily fights with the 
so-called Empress, who 
loathed my father. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my fa -- I say that in my 
books, too, it came to such a point th
at the -- that at night i -- th-
the door to the apartment of -- there were 
-- there was a glass door
, was not knocked but 
hammered on in the mi ddle of the night and my fa
ther opened the -- the 
door, and outside stood a 
little ma n with his nightshirt on, and a f -- and a 
coat thrown over it, the Ka iser, in tears. He 
would say to my father, ﬁShe was so bad to me  
again.ﬂ ﬁSie war immer so schlecht zu mi r.ﬂ She 
was absolutely wicked, and the ki -- my father said
 at one point to us children, and he had also 
ma de it known in Doorn that he would not even go 
take her for a wa -- go for a walk with her, 
because she is capable of jumping into the moat and tell the world I pushed her in. 
Q: Pushed her, right. Now there -- very early
 on, Gestapo come s to your 
house, your father isn™t 
there. This is in -- 
A: This i --  

Q: -- June of 1934 at the -- after the Ni
ght of Long Knives, when they kill -- 

A: Oh, no, no -- 

Q: -- that  early. 

A: -- the Gestapo didn™t come . 

Q: They didn™t come? 

A: Nothing happen -- nothing happened that nigh
t except for -- except for the fact that, you 
know, the next day we found out who had been k
illed, the ma n who constantly came  to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
45 
 
 
house, the former Reichskanzler von -- von -- you know, I say the name , I can™t reme mber it 
now. Schleicher. He had been murdered, you know,
 the Gestapo came into his house, and they 
were having breakfast there, bang, bang, bang, ba
ng, bang. He and his wife, dead. And my father 
was in Holland at the time. He came back, you know, just for a few days, he came back, I sat on 

his lap, where I belonged, in his study, and the p
hone rings.And my father
 said -- he was so 
tired, he said, ﬁYou take it.ﬂ And 
on the phone, that must have been second of July, third of July, 
1934, a fat voice -- 

Q: A fat voice? 

A: A fat voice, not -- you know, I use -- they usually
 identify themselves, and this is so and so, 
can -- Herr von Sell! So I had the 
receiver to my  father, and I saw, ﬁYes?ﬂ And then just a, ﬁyes, 
yes.ﬂ And then he hung up. It had been Göring, tell
ing him that he should
n™t feel all too sure 
about his being safe, the next time  they would ge
t him. And from that day on, I was so afraid of 

my father™s -- of my father™s -- 
Q: And your father told
 you imme di ately, then? 
A: We ll, I was -- 
Q: 10 -- you were just 10. 

A: -- you know, this far from hi m. He was para
lyzed, almost. That overwhelmingly fat -- it™s a 
fat voice, like  nobody -- you know, high pitched. And becau
se my father, of all the Nazis, he -- 
he hated th -- the one he  hated the most
 was Göring, because Göring should have had 

[indecipherable] a flier, a gentlema n, comi ng fr
om a good fa mily, he should have known better. 
Instead he played God, and the famo us saying that
, I decide who is Aryan 
or not, indicated that 
he was in the position to 
decide over life and death. 
Q: And why would Göring be calling your father? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
46 
 
 
A: Because there was a list, obviously, and he was mi ssed. 
Q: He was mi ssed?  He must have -- 

A: He wa -- my father wa -- must have -- 

Q: -- must have been on the list? 

A: Yeah. And so he took the recei
ver himself and called my father
 up. There had been -- my fa -- 
Göring was a personal enemy of my father™s. My
 father had two personal enemies under the -- 
among the Nazis. One was Keitel, Field Marshall 
Keitel, and one was Göri
ng. And those days it 
was Göring who was mu ch more powerful, you know
. Göring was, among other things, he was a 

big hunter. And he would deal with 
my father for the permission to 
hunt at one of th
e estates that 
belonged to the Kaiser. 

Q: I see. 

A: And my father said nyet just a few times t
oo often, until Göring didn™t have to ask permission 
any more, just went. And not even -- he not onl
y came back with the horns or whatever, but for 
th -- terribly precious pictures, carpets and so on. 
But there was very little my father could do.  
Q: Right. 

A: And Göring once -- that -- that
 really did the trick. When Göring came to a party of the 
Hohenzollerns to which he had 
not been invited. Oh boy, yeah.  
Q: And he was asked to leave? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And your father was the one? 

A: Of course. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
47 
 
 
A: You know, there were Nazis among the Hohenzo
llerns. Victoria Louisa. The Kaiser™s only 
daughter. The mother of the fu
ture queen of Greece, who went to school with me  in 
[indecipherable]. She -- she was ready for the 80
th
 birthday of her father, where the entire 
mi shpowha came, to we ar on her beautiful dress,
 a swastika of diamonds . 
And my father stoodin 
the door, and he said, ﬁWith that thing on, you have to step over my body.ﬂ She took it off. There 
was Prince Auguste Wilhelm, there were plenty -- 
and even the Crown Prince. He came  to the -- 
he came to the -- the Potsdam cere mony without be
ing invited. You know, to get hims elf in with 
the Nazis. He  mi ght be king one day, you know? 

Q: Right. 

A: No dignity. 

Q: Now, your father is clearly known as an an
ti-Nazi, the family is known as an anti-Nazi. 
A: Yeah, yeah, oh absolutely, absolutely.  

Q: But there is no -- at this point
, this is early 
on, ™33 - ™34 - ™35. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: There™s no resistance
 group of which he™s a 
part. So he™s not -- 
A: There were -- well, there was no -- you know, th
ere was no resistance move me nt in Germany 
because we couldn™t mo ve. The first batch ofresisters that had been, th -- the feared 

Communists.  

Q: Right. 

A: And the same  ti me  that Hitler, in Potsdam,
 said he would be a good and peaceful leader. The 
first prisoners were ma rched into saxen -- in
-into Sachsenhausen concentration camp, only a 
stone throw away. It was the Socialists, the Communi
sts, the trade unionists.
 And that was all the 
resistance there was. Then came that huge goo -- th
at group, sizeable group of those who said he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
48 
 
 
won™t be so bad, you know, he™s -- he™s ra -- as a 
ma tter of fact, we™ll deal with him. And then 
came the rather big group of those who decided 
to go into inner-emi gration, be Nazi, and don™t 
do anything. And those, after the war, were the mo
st despicable ones, beca
use they could -- they 
claime d they were not anti-Nazi -- they were
 anti-Nazis, but they 
didn™t do anything. 
Q: So you w -- 
A: And that™s when my parents decided to put 
up a fight wherever it was possible. Getting to 
Hitler is as --  is as a -- was as impossible as it 
is now to get ri d of Fidel Castro. Once a dictat or 
has established himself, it is almost impossible to
 get rid of him. And so you must -- you -- there 
were plenty of things, especially helping, he
lping Jews. And that developed slowly, until the 
Jews were really in vital danger, in mortal 
danger. And that™s when 
the Countess Maltzan was 
one of them. She worked with my fa -- oh, my 
fat her, I have to say, was inducted into the 
German ar my, even though he was so terribly w
ounded, and he was muc h too old, after -- a-at -- 
at the beginning of the war, and -- 
Q: In 1939? 
A: -- in ™39, and wa -- and he was sacked by them
 in -- must have been ™42. His -- his boss was 
Canaris, and at the same  outfit where he was 
-- where he was working, there -- it was since -- 
censorship of letters. And that is when he -- he
 and the ga -- Countess Maltzan -- and she only 
told me  that after the war, and that™s where we
 got most of the Jews that came to the house, you 
know?  

Q: So Jews were bei
ng hidden in your house? 

A: I -- they --  

Q: Or passing through? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
49 
 
 
A: -- it wa -- passing through. Our house could -- 
even though where there were no children in 
the house, i-it -- people could not be
 hidden. They just -- they just 
pa -- they just received shelter 
for awhile, claimi ng to be a seamstress, a gardener. 
And then of course th 
-- of the greatest help 
were the air raids, and the -- th
e destruction, so a ma n could turn
 up, unless he looked like -- like 
a Jew, and say all my papers were burned. 
Q: Right, right, so you didn™t have -- 

A: So we loved the British, especially the Br
itish, for -- you know, unloading their bombs over 

our heads, even though I must say I was terrified of them. 

Q: I can imagine, I can imagine. 

A: Terrified. Yet we blessed -- we blessed them every day, and prayed for their safe home  -- 

home -going. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And that™s why -- it wa s as you d -- declare so
me body as a  -- as a cousin of a chauffeur of a 
something like that, wasn™t all too diffi cult. Li
ving in the house for any length of time  would 
have been too -- too different.  

Q: We ll, especially in th
at neighborhood, I imagine. 
A: I mean, hiding -- and esp
ecially in that neighborhood. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Hiding in the mi ddle of the city, not so bad. But 
in order to hide one Jew, that is not clear to 
everybody who just talks about it, you 
have to have -- first of all, 
no children in the house. They 
blabber out -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
50 
 
 
A: -- the truth, you know, th-that new aunt of 
mi ne, you know, some thing like that. And there 
has to be -- there have to be extra rations. 
Q: Right. 

A: So you have to -- the butcher, 
have grocer, a doctor -- somethi
ng like that, and it™s a vast ho -- 
the smaller the cell, the better. You are not
 supposed to know what the other one did. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: I found out rather late about the Sc holls
 in Munich. Munich was a planet away. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: There was nothing in the me dia,
 and that was -- it was, you know
, that™s -- of course it -- word 
got around, but Berlin and Dahlem, and with these 
five fami l i es were wonderful, we were never 
found out. Nobody was found out. 

Q: And the Scholls, you™re talking about The White 
Rose, you™re talking a
bout the students, yes. 
A: Yes, The White Rose, yes, yes. Cause th-the 
surviving si st er  came to visit Martin often after 
the war, after he -- when 
I was there in Wi esbaden. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They were true heroes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Those were true heroes. While the resistance 
group that concentrated, it 
must have been in ™38 
- ™39, planning to get rid 
of Adolf Hitler, the 20
th
 of July ™44 group.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know how Hitler -- tha -- I don™t know how
 ma ny there -- SS nation attempts there were 
against Hitler, it™s almost, you know
 -- several dozen, and they all fa
iled. Hitler had, first of all, 
had the instinct of an animal. And my -- and a 
distant uncle of mi ne von Gasthof, he was a ma jor 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
51 
 
 
in the army, and was supposed to receive Hitler ra
ther late for -- 40™s, to visit a museum, that 
Zeughaus, the military museum in Berlin, and had 
stuffed himself with bombs, and he would -- 
was ready to embrace Hitler in a deadly embrace. 
Hitler sh -- used another entry, and my uncle 
had a hell of a time disarming hi mself. 
Q: Wo w. 

A: But it happened again, and again -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and again. And so then na -- by 1941 we started 
with the Jews, or na --
 ™40 - ™41 - ™42, then 
came these ma ny evenings in our house where vis
itors came at night, 
among them our neighbor 
Admi ral Canaris. General Oster, Count Henkel 
von Donnersma rk, my t wo f -- cousins, Haeften, 
Ulrich von Hassel. And they came 
at night, and my ma -- the first time they came, I asked my 

mother what are they doing? And she said, ﬁSie morden.ﬂ ﬁThe y are committing murder.ﬂ And 

then they would leave one by one, back of the h
ouse, and all that. The only one who survived 
was the Count Henkel von Donnersma rk. And I saw 
him ma ny times after the 
war, all the others 
were -- 

Q: They were killed. 

A: -- hanged. 

Q: Mm-hm. We have to stop the tape. 

A: Again? 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
52 
 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: In 1937, you are sent to a boarding school. 
A: Yes.  

Q: Why?  Why did they send you away? 

A: Well, for two reasons. First of all, I should 
get away from Ditte, my 
twin at heart, and I 
should meet girls from my own s -- from my 
own caste. And that was a b-boarding -- elite 
boarding school, small, for daughters of -- for the 
noble name s. There were three girls there who 
were not me mbers of nobility, and they g-got to h
ear it every day. That really wasn™t fitting, you 

know, not [indecipherable] 

Q: So there™s a kind of meanness in this group? 

A: Oh, a kind, yes. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Well, anyway, I was there for t -- se
nt there for th -- the other was -- 
Q: Well, wait a mi nute, wait a mi nute. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Why wer e  you ha -- why did you have to separa
te from Ditte?  Why -- were you two just crazy 
-- 

A: W- We  were two -- we had a terrible infl
uence on one another, you know, that™s why. But it 
was a fr iendship that  wouldn™t br eak to this da
y. And -- and then the other reason was that the 
situation with the BDM or the Hitler Youth wasgetting more precarious every day. So that was 

the beginning of a phase, you know, when I went to
 that school, later to
 other schools, where I 
trained mys e lf -- or I s -- I thought of it myse
lf. When asked, are you in the BDM, I said, ﬁOf 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
53 
 
 
course, in Be rlin.ﬂ You know, I mean, I™m here
 only temporarily, why should I -- you know. And 
I did th -- I repeated that and it worked until 
shortly before graduation, they wouldn™t let me  
graduate. 
Q: Because they knew it was not true. 

A: [indecipherable] it wasn™t true, no, no. Found out. 

Q: Now, how is -- how is Ditte surviving?  Do they know that their mother is Jewish -- 

A: Miracle. 

Q: -- or they don™t know? 

A: Yes, by that time  they -- of Jewish extraction, you know, some how. 

Q: So is she a mi schlinge? 

A: -- but Ditte -- she was a mi sh -- sh-she w
ould have been called a mi schlinge first -- 
Q: First class. 

A: First gr ade or first class. 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: And she even -- she went to 
st -- as a student  to Heidelberg
 and -- and signed a document with 
her name  that she was purely Aryan. She was -- 
it was one mi racle after the other. And she did 
her own resisting in Heidelberg, my God -- 

Q: Really? 

A: -- yeah. The more you were in danger,the more you did. You know, it became a sport. 

Q: Why, because you think that some  of these people had nothi ng to lose? 

A: We ll, it c -- became  -- I don™t know wh
at it was, I don™t know what it was. 
Q: But that™s certainly not true for a lot of people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
54 
 
 
A: Oh, you better believe it, yeah, 
but through those inactiv
e anti-Nazis, I have 
very little to s -- 
all this they have really good reas
ons to explain their in
ertia. And those who sa
id bad things will 
not happen in Germany because we 
wouldn™t let them do them, you know? 
Q: Yeah. Were you very sad to l
eave, to go to boarding school? 
A: Oh, I hated it. I hated it and I planned my escap
e fr om there to Holland, to the Kaiser. And in 
my dreams a t  night, just before
 going to sleep, I would imagine how he would stand there, 
opening his arms, oh my  poor, poor child, of course
 you can stay here. But then behind him was 
that witch, and she™d say no. 
Q: And you -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- and you knew that sh
e would not approve, yeah. 
A: Oh, of course. 

Q: But you still fantasized this escape? 
A: I met Kaiser in -- so-called majesty [i ndeciphe
rable] only once, and there was instant loathing 
on both sides. 
Q: Of her?  

A: I wa -- of her -- 

Q: Of her, and -- 

A: And -- and -- and she for me . 
She later complained to my father, your daughter behaved in a 
terrible way, you know. My father just smiled. 

Q: And how old were you when you me t?  

A: Nine. 

Q: Nine. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
55 
 
 
A: 10 - 11.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Was in Berlin. 

Q: Now you also had to leave Sunday school, so
 you couldn™t see -- because this is 19 -- 
A: No, but I -- yeah -- 

Q: Well, ™37 -- 

A: ™37 I™m -- 

Q: -- he™s already -- is -- 

A: I was home for the first time  from boarding 
school for summer vacation, and then came  the 
news that he had been arrested. 

Q: Rested. 

A: And I reme mber jumping on my bicycle, going fr
om friend to friend to friend, telling them all 
the terrible news, which was in the newspapers the next day, you know. Awful. 
Q: We re you worried over the last few years bot
h about your father and about Niemoeller?  Wa s 
he  
A: Niemoeller, yes, of course, I had fallen in
 love with Niemoeller at age 13 - 14, al-allowed 
myself to get a first rate crush on him. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Cause he would hardly notice me , you know. And 
of course I was terribly worried. And the 
whole family alone now, and my 
father went right over, he couldn™t go on summer vacation with 

us, because he felt he had to 
take care of the family, but th
ey had -- they ha d ma ny friends. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They did not -- were not 
needy, I mean, in a -- i-i -- in
 a physical kind of way.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
56 
 
 
Q: And whe r e would -- where did the fa m -- where 
did Mrs. Niemoeller and their six children at 
this point -- 
A: This -- they still -- they still live
d -- they still lived in the parsonage. 
Q: In the parsonage? 

A: Yes. And lived there until 19 -- until the time 
that Martin was transferred fr om Dachau -- 

Q: To sa -- 

A: -- from -- sorry, from Sachsenhausen to Dach
au, then she moved in with friends at Lake 
Starnberg so she could visit her husband. 

Q: And she was allowed to do that? 

A: Yes, once in awhile she could visit him.  

Q: That™s unusual. 

A: There were di -- well, ev
erythi ng was unusual because he wa
s Hitler™s only private pri -- 
prisoner. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Legally he could -- they couldn™t do anythi
ng about him at -- the highest German court had 

acquitted him, which at 1938 proved that ther
e we re judges in Germany who based their 
judgments, their verdicts on the law -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and on the law alone. 

Q: Right. 

A: Which deeply dist urbed Hitler. 

Q: Yeah. Now, when yo u™re
 at this terrible school. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
57 
 
 
Q: You go for a walk. You actually shake Hitler™s
 hand at the [indeciphera
ble]. What happened? 
A: Yeah, yeah, well that wasn™t -- you know, we 
were taken -- we were dragged on walks every 
afternoon, and what -- 
Q: You were dragged? 

A: How do you know -- two by two -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and then -- and one day we did not go in the 
woods, we were j -- one of our classmates had 
had a -- an operation, I think it 
was appendicitis and we were 
supposed to visit her in the 
hospital. That was in 1938 in the 
summer, I believe. And we ma  -- just four or six of us ma rched 
-- with a teacher, ma rched towards the town a
nd in town, you know and the -- I still reme mber 
the street, I could find it again, 
with ugly apartment buildings. Eber
swalde is the name of the -- 
the -- the -- th-the t-town of
 37. Notorious now for anti-Semitism and anti-foreignenism, you 
know. And the Nazism, of course. And we -- about tw
ice as far as from here to -- to that door, 
we see several huge limo usines with -- open ca
rs and limousines with swastika emblems and we 
stood still and the teachers [indeci
pherable] what mi ght that be
, you know?  And there was either 
policemen, I don™t -- unifor med me n who kept 
us back, just a mome
nt, you can™t pass through 
here. And the very mo ment we had arrived, as
 close as now as from here to the door -- 
Q: So about 10 feet.  

A: -- that door opens and out come s a group of 
men, and with them a li -- a man ma -- about my 
size, with a moustache and a va
 -- za -- Bavarian hat on, trench
coat, no uniform, nothing. And by 
Jove, it was Adolf Hitler. And he sees us, and he
 thinks we™ve appeared in his honor, of course, 
you know?  And we just stood there, so he went 
fwa -- one -- one to one, shaking hands, and 
asking o-our names and where we came from and all 
that, and then he j -- just went in the car and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
58 
 
 
drove away. We  didn™t -- we didn™
t really b -- nobody believed us but
 the next day it was in the 
newspapers that Hitler had visite
d the widow of an old comr ade in
 Eberswalde, so there was -- 
I™ll never forget his fishy handsa -- shake. 
Q: He had a fishy handshake? 

A: Fishy handshake. And while my mother got sick
 while there wa -- once their eyes crossed in -
- in an opera, during an opera visit, my mother became so violently ill my father had to take her 

home, she couldn™t sit thr -- thr
ough the opera. And others were obs
essed with his charisma  and 
his blue eyes, I felt nothing. There was a ver -- 
a vo -- a very ordinary ma n, and he was even 
smiling. But I had no -- 

Q: Nothing. 

A: Nothing. While one of the girls sank to the gr
ound, and wanted to ki ss the spot that Hitler™s 
foot had touched.  

Q: Really. 
A: Well that™s -- well, that 
was my meeting with Hitler. 
Q: But of course, you were primed 
for so ma ny years against hi -- 
A: Unlike my -- 
Q: -- right -- 

A: -- classmates -- 

Q: -- classmates, right, right. 

A: -- of cour -- I couldn™t believe [indecipherable]
 this ma n™s supposed to have to done so much 
evil. Yes, and more. 

Q: So how were you with thes
e girls at the school, you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
59 
 
 
A: I -- some of them, thi -- they 
were all -- all came, except for me
 and a couple of others who c -
- were -- came  from Ber lin or Ha
mburg, they came from vas t  estates. 
Q: Uh-huh, very wealthy. 
A: And never seen anything except foxes and 
hares and deer. Well, well, was okay, I™m -- 
Q: Wa s there any indoctrinati
on at the school, or -- is -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- nothing, nothing? 

A: No, no. 

Q: This is just -- 

A: None. 

Q: Huh. 

A: We knew the -- the -- th
e headmi stresses both were very strong anti-Nazis. 
Q: Oh, they were? 
A: Oh yes. But they had -- for instance, they ha
d to put up the swastika flag every day, and have 
it a -- just to s -- 
let the neighbors think we were -- 
Q: And did most of you realize that
 this was a kind of conspiracy? 
A: Most of them didn™t give a -- didn™t gi
ve a hang about it. I was the only one who was 
politically informed. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The only one.  

Q: Uh-huh. So that must have also 
been difficult for you to be there.  
A: All was di -- everything was difficult for me . 

Q: Everything was -- how was the food? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
60 
 
 
A: Gecchh! 
Q: Terribl e. 

A: You know -- yeah, it -- it wa
s terrible, absolutely
 terrible. Insufficient too, you know. Cheap, 
and -- but that was Prussian, you know. 

Q: This was part of the Pr ussian upbringing? 

A: Part of the Prussian upbringing was also to
 be of nobility and not to wear glasses. Can you 

imagine Frederick the Gr eat, and Martin Luther 
with glasses?  Stupid. Two of the girls were 
extremely short sigh
ted. Nearsighted.  
Q: But you™re not allowed to wear glasses? 

A: Yes, they were. 

Q: They were? 

A: But they were put down
 every ti -- every day. 
Q: Oh I see, I see. 
A: How I loved the day when I left. 
Q: But were the classes 
good?  We re the teachers good? 
A: Oh yeah.  

Q: They were okay? 

A: Yeah. Then we went the -- the sec
ond year we went to the local school. 
Q: Uh-huh. Now where were you on Kristallnacht. 

A: There. 

Q: You were there. 

A: At the house, at the main house -- 

Q: And did you see -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
61 
 
 
A: -- we saw the -- the s
ky, the dark sky lighting up. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And then the -- the super™s wife came  in and sa
id, ﬁThere™s a fire in th
is -- in the town.ﬂ And 
the headmi stress, one of them, took th-the few 
-- they all wanted to 
-- to stay up there, nobody 
was interested, except for ma y -- three or four. We
 went down and saw, and -- and -- and just -- 
you know, as soon as we reached the c
ity, the real ci -- as much as or
 little as there was, did we 
realize how ma ny Jewis h shops there mu
st have been. There was of the -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- howling of people, chanting. Broken glass,broken doors, everything. And all of a sudden I 

found myself shoved and pressed 
against the -- the fence sepa
rating me and the -- and the 
synagogue. And I was immediately -- I 
noticed that the fire brigade, 
the fire hoses were in this 
direction, one house, another house, in between
 was the burn -- burning synagogue, and outside 
later the -- the -- the si-silver  
items a nd the Torah scrolls which they had taken apart and 
trampled on by Hitler Youth and SR. There was to -- ther e was no SS there, as far as I reme mber. 

Q: Now you™re 14 years old?  No. 

A: 15. 

Q: 15. 

A: 15. 

Q: 15. 

A: I was so shocked. 

Q: This was a big impression on you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
62 
 
 
A: That was -- of course, I mean had I been at
 home  in Dahlem, I wouldn™t have seen anything 
because there were no shops, you know, nothing. N
one of my  fa mily saw anything, I was the 
only one, thanks to the fact -- and then Je
ws driven out of the 
synagogue, with the -- 
Q: And you saw that? 
A: -- ye -- I -- oh, I saw the -- must have been 
the rabbi™s fami ly and thrown on trucks, speeding 
away and that was it. And I went home  and that 
same evening I wrote a description to my parents 
ending with the words in German, 
of course, people behaved like 
wild beasts. Yeah, that  was it. 
Q: And is this a turning -- for ma
ny people this is a turning point.  
A: Well, it-- 

Q: -- or was this some thing -- 

A: Not for me , really. 

Q: Not for you. 

A: No, no, it would have -- course it was everyt
hing -- one hopes, especially as a child, that 
every deed like that will be
 the last one, you know?  Ha! We  hadn™t seen the beginning yet. 
Q: No. Did your parents want to leave Germany? 

A: Never, never. 

Q: Never. They never thought about it? 

A: Oh no. A country they -- their families, thei
r clan had helped to build up over centuries?  
Would have been desertion. And 
there is the fact that once you
™re out you can™t do anything any 
more. No, no, they didn™t have to for racial r
easons. The Jews had nothing else to do if they 
wanted to save their lives. Because the -- 

Q: So there was a sense of
 responsibility to stay? 
A: Absolutely. To be there, to stay th
ere and take over once 
the time has passed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
63 
 
 
Q: Right. Did you expect war? 
A: My father told in -- i -- said that in 1933. 

Q: It would be war? 

A: I reme mb er him saying to my then brother -- 
no, he later became my -- my brother-in-law, my 

sister™s husband, and you will see that the da y 
will come -- first of all, he was a paper 

ma nufacturer, that if you ma ke toile
t rolls this wide, and if you want
 to make them a little wider, 
you™ll be  in a concentration camp. And Hitler wi
ll start a war, he was only waiting for an 
opportunity. Of course, that we always -- and yo
u know whe n -- when -- when the war started, I 
was kind of elated, because I t
hought now that™s -- that™s the be
ginning of a -- of the end -- 
Q: Of the end. 

A: -- and the end will come  soon. Of course we ha
d no idea of how short the blitzkrieg would be. 
And I s -- I™ve seen my father crying three tim
es in -- in my life. One was when Uncle 
Eberhard™s wife, Maria died of
 blood poisoning. He couldn™t gr
asp it. The next time  was -- 
Q: And Eberhard is your mother™s brother? 

A: Eberhard™s -- brother, yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: She was from -- our family was fr om Odessa.  

Q: Mm. 

A: Second time  was whe n his beloved Rotterdam wa
s laid into ashes by the Nazis. And the third 
time was when Hitler star ted hi s war against Russia. That I reme mber. 

Q: So you were there at each of these times to see him?  

A: Yes, yes, that™s when I -- 

Q: So there ma y have be en -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
64 
 
 
A: I witnessed it. 
Q: -- ma ny more times that he cried, but you -- 

A: Probably, probably. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: My father was so sensitive and so -- oh, well 
I sa -- I said to Elie Wi esel, you know, for 40 
years, four oh years, I was not able to me nti
on my father and his -- hi
s -- not talk about ma  -- 
about him at all, because I couldn™t, I couldn™t. 
Even my own son was of the opinion that in the 
wake of the 20
th
 of July, my father had some how lost
 his life. That was good enough for him, 
you know. And then -- but after I met Elie Wi esel, 
he said -- it was up in his apartment on th -- 
still on the West Side, which was gorgeous. 
Looking down -- it was April ™85, looking down on 
the -- on the park that ju -- was just beginni
ng to bloom, and he sa
id, you know, ﬁAnd now you 
must tell me  all about your father.ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁElie, I can™t. I haven™t done it for 40 years 
[indecipherable].ﬂ And he said, 
ﬁYou must.ﬂ And under streaming 
tears I told him the entire 
story. After which he s -- Marion 
was there too. After that he took 
me  in his arms and comforted 
me . And we were at Martin™s grave, by the 
way, in Germany, together. And he said, ﬁAnd now 
you have to learn to speak in public
 about that.ﬂ I said, ﬁI can ne
ver speak in public.ﬂ ﬁOf course 
you can.ﬂ Then later -- a year later, I said -- 
and he said, ﬁNow you have to write a book.ﬂ ﬁI 
can™t write a book.ﬂ ﬁOf course you can.ﬂ And then
 I came to him one day and I said, ﬁElie, I™m 
going to be Jewish.ﬂ And he said 
-- he left -- were two -- two wo
rds of, he said, ﬁOf course.ﬂ  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Beginning and end of discussi
on. But he has opened windows in my life that I didn™t -- doors 
of my -- in my life that I didn™t ev
en know existed. Bless him for that. 
Q: Right.

A: And ma ny other things. Yeah, now I™m
 home , and I™ve been sacked from school. 
Q: You -- you were kicked out of school. 
A: Yes, I was kicked out. 

Q: What did you do? 

A: We ll, I was sent to one of my 
-- to -- out of the way, a-away, away, to an estate of friends -- of 
-- of -- of -- one of the many estate
s of family me mbers and I stayed 
that -- there, until -- because 
-- yeah, I stayed there, helping in the hous
ehold, you know, learning about household and all 
that. And then I s -- decided to do some thing that
 would vastly amuse his ma jesty. I declared to 
my father that I™m going to go be a -- a -- a -- an ac
tress. Go on sta -- an actress. That had never 
happened in that family --  

Q: Oh, of course not. 

A: -- to stoop that low, you know? 

Q: Right. 
A: So he went to Holland. Must have been before
 -- of course, before his death. And he sa -- my 
father said to His Majesty -- I -- he had to te
ll him some thing personal and wanted his advice. 
The little monkey -- no, my -- my ba  -- Billa, he 
called me , s he wants to go on stage. The little 
monkey wa nts to be an actress?  An
d then he -- he hit my father on the shoulder, and he said, 
ﬁAnd to you of all people this must happen.ﬂ A
nd he thought it was a ma rvelous idea, so my 
father came home  in a different mood, and he sa
id, ﬁAll right, if you pass the entrance exam of 
the state actors school, yi -- I will let you.ﬂ And 
of course, then these things developed, I was 
accepted, and the Kaiser even lived to see it happen. 

Q: So where did you get this idea that you wanted 
to be an actor?  How did that happen?  Or had 
you been doing it all your life? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
66 
 
 
A: We ll, I w -- I was enough -- it was probably 
first of all to shock my gra ndmother. But 
otherwise I wanted to be so
me body, you know, by now it was clear th
at I would not always stay 
quite that home ly. And I had boyf
 -- me n friends, always older me n as boyfriends. And I was -- 
Q: Even when you were in boarding school? 

A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no 

Q: No. 

A: No, no, no. No, no. 

Q: No, once you have been kicked out. 

 A: Oh, after that, yes. And then, you know, th
e stage was a very safe place for anti-Nazis. 
Q: Really? 

A: You were practically taboo. Ye
 -- I didn™t have to go to th
e labor studio -- attend the labor 
service, nobody asked me about
 the BDM or party, nothing. Y
ou were safe, you were on a 
different level. And I knew that, of course, 
because I knew enough actors in Berlin now. I had 
my two years in Berlin of ballet,
 and of -- education of -- you know. 
Q: And whe n did you -- when did 
you go to the academy?  Was it -- 
A: April -- 

Q: It was after the war started. 

A: Oh yes -- 

Q: After -- 

A: -- a-after my 18
th
 birthday, in a -- in ™41. 
Q: In ™41 you started? 

A: I became th -- I -- the favorite st udent -- 

Q: Of Walter -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
67 
 
 
A: Walter Franck. 
Q: -- Franck. 

A: A very fa mous German actor . One of the fa milies who hid Jews -- 

Q: Yes, he had a -- 

A: -- [indecipherable] his wife.  

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: [indecipherable] wife. 

Q: Yes, and your -- and this is the group from 
which some times Jews would come  to your house 
-- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- your families house. 

A: Or -- or go vice-a-versa, you know? 

Q: And you had a relationship with him?  
A: Oh yes, we had a loving relationship for 
two years, and he taught me  the basics and 
everything. And it™s still -- it™s 
still true, you know, what to do as
 a woma n, too, and what not to 
do. Of course, as an 18 year old -- 
he would never touch a -- a girl
 who had no experiences at all, 
but we were in a relationship, can say that, and 
two most happy years ended, hit -- it never -- it 
wa -- grew into a deep friendship, and ended 
only with his untimely death in -- in -- I don™t 
reme mber, ™68. 
Q: Did you live together? 

A: Oh no, no -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- he was very happily ma rried. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
68 
 
 
Q: Oh, I see.  
A: He was 30 years older than I. What else is
 new?  And he -- but he needed some body on the 
side, always, whether that woma n was Marlene Di
etrich, or Elizabeth Be
rgner, or I, it was 
always a relationship th
at lasted two years. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes, very strange. And his wife, I don™t know 
how much s he knew. She liked me , I liked her. 
And well -- and then we -- 

Q: Wa s that odd for you as a young person, being with a ma rried ma n, and knowing the wife, is 

that odd? 

A: But it came so easily -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- if -- if some body a sked me  was  it odd for me 
to rav -- to -- to -- to
 convert to Judaism -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- you know?  It was -- it came in such --  
Q: It was -- uh-huh.  

A: -- it was done so tactfully, a
nd s -- based -- it was based on fr
iendship, and the same  political 
opinion. He was the fi -- that, 
he didn™t tell anybody, the firs
t cousin of Field Marshall 
Kesserling. 

Q: Really? 

A: And they looked alike.  

Q: Did you work with him on the stage, or was he no longer acting? 

A: Oh, yes, he was acting. 

Q: He was then acting. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
69 
 
 
A: As a -- only on the theater that was under 
Göring. And ger -- and Goebbels was mo vies. And 
those two had a very intima te ene my-ship, you 
know?  So Göring wouldn™t let anybody touch his 
theater, and in the -- and Goebbels, he struck hi
m -- Walter Franck fr om the list of actors to 
appear in movies, because he had never b -- gone 
to one of his receptions, always inventing one 
ailment after the other. So -- but you -- it 
didn™t -- didn™t distur b his theater career. 
Q: Right. Were you a good actress,
 you think?  Did you like it? 
A: I loved it. But I was then doing my  first engage
me nt in Danzig, Nazi to
wn of the fi rst caliber , 
which was -- I wasn™t used to that, you know?  I 
-- I began suffering from stage fright, and it 
became so bad that I -- aft -- then I 
went to Esse n, and then came  the 20
th
 of July, and the 
theaters were closed, and Essen was in the war. 
No Nazis, strangely enough. But the east?  They 
got what they deserved, and they deserved what 
they got. And the entire ensemble died, because 
they -- except me, because they tried to flee on th
e Gustloff, Wilhel m Gustloff, the ship that was 
sunk by a -- by a Russian torpedo. And I would have
 be -- by God™s grace, I wasn™t. Yeah -- and 
no, but then, after the war, I became  -- I became  a  -- an announcer -- a speaker on -- on the radio. 

Q: Right, right, right. 

A: That I wer -- no problems at all.  

Q: Did your parents see you on stage? 

A: Yeah, my mother. 

Q: Your mother saw you, not your father? 

A: No, he was already in prison, I believe. 

Q: Uh-huh. And did she enjoy that? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: She did? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
70 
 
 
A: Very strange experience. 
Q: And your brother? Or was he in the war? 

A: No, he wa -- my brother was -- 

Q: He was away. 

A: He was a soldier -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- at age 16. 

Q: 16. 

A: But fortunately he was in Denmar k, being stat
ioned in the house of a pastor. And there was a 
deep friendship, and he -- until the pastor di
ed, visited hi m after the war, all the time. 
Q: Now, I understand that you, in a certain way re
jected the confessing --
 even the Confessing 
Church, at a young age? 

A: What they did, when they could have done some thing. 
Q: Whey they could have done more.  
A: What of -- some thing, you know. 

Q: Something. 

A: We ll that™s was, you know, theStuttgart Declaration of guilt. 

Q: Yes, explain that, what is -- what was that? 

A: That was -- well, when Martin returned from t he concentration camp, livid -- 

Q: This is after? 

A: Yeah. A terrible embarrassment for all the 
people who claime d they couldn™t have done 
anything, you know, and here he come s. Oh, had 
he only died, they would have built a church 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
71 
 
 
with his name  and all that. But he came  back ju
st at the mo me nt when t hey began business as 
usual, without a -- anything. 
Q: Right. 

A: So he forced the part, that Stuttgart Decl
aration. But the most important  sentences were 
stricken. The church said we should ask forgiveness because they had not prayed enough, and 

not done enough. And he said -- Martin said, bu
llshit. Excuse me . They did nothing. Which is 
true, after Hitler was very, very wise, taking 
him away from his flock, because -- which was 
supposed to become  a resistance group. They -- th
ere were -- there were 
ma rtyrs there of the 
Confessing Church, fa -- fal -- Snyder you know, 
and ma ny others. But -- excuse me , senior 
mome nt. But as a group they arranged themselves, 
only to claim after the war that they hadn™t 

prayed enough. Hah! But you know, Martin was a t
horn in their flesh from the f -- mome nt one 
to his death. Before his death he said into m
ovie cameras, television came ras, ﬁAnd if I did not 
receive my pension from the church, I would beco
me  a Quaker.ﬂ He wasn™t
 at the hierarchy, oh 
that bugged him. He would not re
si -- accept the title bishop. 

Q: Right. [indecipherable]re ma ined a pastor, yes? 

A: He rema ined pastor and president, presid
ent of the church [ind
ecipherable] Council of 

churches, and president 
of the -- of the church of Hessen and Nassau. 
Q: Right. All right, we have to stop the tape. 
End of Tape Four

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Sibylle, I asked you a question 
close to when we stopped, and 
I think you answ
ered it in a 
different way than I asked it. Why was it that you le
ft the church when -- 
in your self description 
that you left the church 
when you were about 18. 
A: 18 - 19, because I realized there w -- it -- th
e Confessing Church would not live up to Martin 
Niemoeller™s expectations. And they were inert,
 they did nothing. And my
 [indecipherable] and 
to add some thing personal, you know there were three pastors in -- in Dahlem, and there was so 
much trouble between them, personal things, that
 my mother -- my mother and my -- I mean, 

leaving the church doesn™t mean th
at I declared my -- my -- excuse
 me , I -- I have to think. No, 
my -- my pa rents also -- I didn™t go to church 
any more, and neither did they. There were -- 
Q: But you still felt that
 you were a Christian? 
A: Y-Yes, moderately so. But you know then la
ter, when I came to Ne w York and lived among 
Jews, the church -- I didn™t -- I didn™t
 go back to the church there either. 
Q: Right. 

A: And later when I ma  - -  ma  -- I ma r r ied Ma
rtin Niemoeller, he urged me  to study about it 
more, and gave me  books. And what that led to
 wa s my conve rsion to Judaism, because it™s a 
logical way, you know?  I found my root
s, that™s what -- how Elie Wi
esel put it. I -- I told him 
I™m going to be Jewish, and he said, ﬁOf cour
se, you want to go back to your roots.ﬂ 
Q: Mm-hm. But during the war period -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- that™s not the direction that
 you feel you™re going in. You just
 simply are -- you™re angry at 
the church for what it™s not doing. 

A: No, I™m a ngry at the church, but I 
would never have formal ly left it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
73 
 
 
Q: Yes. 
A: Because being a me mber of the Confessing C
hurch was a sign, an outward sign that you were 
not for the Nazis. 

Q: Right, right. No ma tter what 
it wasn™t doing, it still was -- 
A: Exactly. 

Q: -- clearly anti-Nazi. 

A: Exactly. 

Q: Right. Now tell me  just a -- a -- the little 
story about Leni Riefenstahl™s house and what was 
going on -- 

A: Oh, yes, absolutely. 

Q: -- in the baseme nt. 

A: Mm-hm. Well, after -- that
 must have been around the 20
th
 of July, ™44, when my fat her -- 
first the Gestapo came and -- and took me  on the 21
st
. But -- 
Q: Do you want to tell the story about the assassin
ation plot, and then this
 -- and then go to Leni 
Riefenstahl, would that ma ke more sense? 

A: Oh no, we -- I can go back and forth. 

Q: Okay. 

A: And -- and after my father -- 
it was -- must have been around th
at time that we stopped being 
-- being pa rt of that circle hiding Je ws b
ecause the Gestapo -- and they always come  
unannounced, were searching the ho
use all the time , and nobody was served by that. So, through 
a ma n I me t on a train -- and my instinct always 
told me  he™s okay, or she™s okay, or not, I found 

entry into a very intere
sting group of resisters in Dahlem 
who specialized in forging papers, 
forging money, and the whole thing. And ha 
-- hiding people, or sending then into hiding, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
74 
 
 
German ar my deserters, Jews, whoever came to th
eir door, they were take
n care of. And that all 
took place in the gardener™s house, adjacent to Le
ni Riefenstahl™s beautiful villa, which remi nded 
one of Hitler™s Berkoff. It was probabl y builtwith B-Berkoff i n mi nd. I never saw the lady, she 
was out filming on th -- all through the war. But 
she had just been ma rried to a German officer 

by the name  of Jarkop, he was a ma jor. And he popped up once in awhile, so we had to be very, 

very careful. And I reme mber going there once, 
there was the so-called caretaker, with his so-
called wife. They weren™t ma rried, you know, but 
they gained, some how, Leni Riefenstahl™s 
trust, and were taking care -- you know, with 
all the bombing, care of the house and garden, and 
very fast through this -- this ma n, Hans Andres
 was his name , and he was a funny existence. He 
was very mu ch anti-Nazi, and -- but he was d
ealing on the black ma rket, I think, and black 
ma rket meant money, money, mone y. And money was 
always needed. And in the cellar of that 
house there were machine -- first 
of all there was an arsenal of
 weapons. And then there was a 
money forging machine, and a mone y printing m
achine and -- and paper forging machine, and 
all that, and they -- they took me into that, you kn
ow, into their trust, th
ey knew they could, and 
the s -- as soon as some body had come , and ther
e were -- usually they 
were received in the 
kitchen, and got some thing to eat and to dri
nk. And with the slightest noise that was not 
expected, there was an opening in the floor thro
ugh which you could go down in the cellar. They 
were quickly pushed down, and the carpet o-over th
em. And one day I was there, the caretaker, 
Powell and I were there. Powell was wearing an 
apron, green gardener™s apron when there was a 
knock at the door. God, what is it now?  There were
 two deserters in the 
kitchen. Down with the 
deserters. It was Leni Riefenst
ahl™s dear husband. And Powell said
 to me, ﬁKeep him out of the 
kitchen.ﬂ And he pushed me  -- bu -- bu -- bu -- ma de me  drag him into the bedroom, you know. I 

was red -- not ready, but prepared for anythi
ng. And -- and he would -- and Powell said, ﬁYou 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
75 
 
 
know, we™ve just wipe d the floor of the kitche n, ju
st will -- if you give us a mi nute.ﬂ So I went 
into the little bedroom wi th him. An e xtrem
ely stupid looking ma n by the way, and -- and then 
he just wanted to see if everything was in order.
 Oh yes, of course, He
rr Major, of course Herr 
Major. At that time  I didn™t know yet who he 
was. There hadn™t been time, you know, was just 
some body. And then he came into the kitchen, looked around, everything seemed fine, 
everything had been pushed into drawers, and --and bottles into the closets and all that. And 

then he said -- and the car was -- st aff car was wa
iting for him, and he said now he -- he had to 
go back to the front. The front was probably 10 
miles away, or 20 miles away. And then Powell 
told me , ﬁYou know who that was?  That was Le
ni Riefenstahl™s husband.ﬂ And that was the 
closest call I™ve -- 

Q: That you had? 

A: -- that I reme mber. And Hans was the one 
who furnished all of us with a weapon. That 
weapon, a little Ortgiess [indeci
pherable] that saved my life a nd shot an SS ma n. 
Q: So that you got from him?  

A: I got that from Hans. Because -- I wr
ite in my book it™s -- was my father™s -- 
Q: Yes, but it wasn™t. 

A: -- it really the -- no, my father ha
d a similar one. But it was Hans™ -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- who suggested that
 I always carry it. 
Q: Carry it. 

A: Yeah. In -- at the time I had b
een in -- I had been -- the theaters 
had been closed by the führer 
on the first of September. I had 
never lived to see the opening ni
ght for ﬁTaming of the  Shrewﬂ 
in -- in Essen. And I was now a f
r-free -- a free  for all, what wa
s I going to do?  They came  and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
76 
 
 
inducted me  into the -- into the flak, the wo
m -- you know, the women for the flak, wh-what is 
the flak? Anti -- 
Q: Anti-aircraft. 

A: -- aircraft. And I went for -- for an inte
rview there, I mean, that was dema nded. And a 
absolutely horrible woman, you know, a sergeant as a 
-- she was a Nazi, and 
she -- she really was 
-- was ready to let me  ha ve it as a daughter of a J
unker, and -- and -- and a pra -- a jailbird and all 
that. And so it was agreed that by the first of Oct
ober, I would start there.
 And I said to myself, 
no, I™m not going to do that. And one day I ope
ned a newspaper, and in the -- were few 
newspapers at [indecipherable] time because of 
the paper shor tage. And I opened the ne wspaper 
and there is an add that urgently girls -- fema les,
 were sought to replace me n to go to the front, to 
train horses. A remonté -- a remonté is a ho -- a 
young horse not trained yet. So, outside of the 

Berlin there was the cavalries -- was the cavalr
y. And I went for an exam, and I was accepted, 
and I went back and I went myself to tell 
this female sergeant th
at the cavalry outranked 
[indecipherable] you know [indecipherable] and sh
e cou -- wouldn™t get me. And then I went 
into the -- in the caval ry, and -- 

Q: And you were trained as a young -- this 
is one of the things your father -- 
A: Yeah, yes, yes. 

Q: -- wanted you to learn to do is -- is ride horses. 

A: Yes, and I had a talent for riding, for dressa
ge especially. I was always afraid jumping, to 
jump, always. Never lost that fear. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, I -- before I was thrown so ma ny ti
me s. We ll, anyway, w-we -- and you know, training 
a horse from scratch is a 
very, very taxing thing.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
77 
 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: A horse doesn™t like it. 

Q: Right. 

A: Not one bit. But we had to do it, I had six or
 seven horses every day, si
 -- ride six or seven 
hours a day. But you know, we were in a -- in a -- in
 a hut, in a barrack, with three bedrooms, all 
of us girls, and most of them were from nob
ility, because after all, who could ride , you know? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And they were all, with few exceptions, very, 
very nice. I still have one I™m in contact with. 
Q: Yes? 

A: And it was very exhausting, bu
t it -- I had a wonderful commande
r, th-the -- the colonel, 
Colonel Behnke. I call him different in my -- 
in my book. And he -- I told him -- I -- I -- I 
relieved my self of my -- you know, 
I told him of my father, and he was so good, and he said ma  -
- at that time my father was in a prison in Berl
in, and we didn™t know where. I had to search for 
him. I found him there, but only because that nice
 colonel let me  go to Be rlin on some  kind of a 
mi ssion, you know. I was wearing unifor m, riding boots, e-especially t -- all tailored for us, you 

know?  And well we -- I would stay there unt
il the end of -- of 
the war, probably.  
Q: Right. 

A: And in the stables, helping us, were Russian
s, Russian prisoners of war. Every mor ning a 
troop of bedraggled le -- figures came from that
 -- the -- the -- the camp, you know, the POW 
camp to help us in the stables. And they were
 having a wonderful time with us. We  gave them 
bread, the stables were warm. I onc e visited th
at camp to identify a certain man, and it was -- 
there were vi  -- on -- they were sl
eeping on the -- they didn™t even
 have straw, was stone floors. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

And what -- what one of them told me they drag
 -- they dreaded nothing more than the Sundays 
when they didn™t have to work, what were they supposed to do
?  And well that™s -- 
Q: Let™s go back a little bit. 
A: Yeah, please. 

Q: Cause when you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: [indecipherable] ahead. 

A: Yeah, yeah, of course, I™m going too far. 

Q: There -- there -- there are two things I wa
nt to ask you. One -- one is, what rumors are you 
hearing about what the Nazis are doing to Jews in Poland? 

A: Oh, no rumors, we listened to the BBC.  

Q: And you -- and what are you told, 
di -- you -- did you listen to th -- 
A: The Voice of America. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Da da da daa.  

Q: Okay. 

A: Oh yes, it™s -- 

Q: And wha t  did you -- 

A: -- when I was away from home  -- 

Q: You were -- 

A: -- I heard nothing. 

Q: You heard nothing? 

A: Nothing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
79 
 
 
Q: But when you were back in Berlin -- 
A: Back in Berlin, in -- 

Q: In 40 -- you™re back there by ™43 or ™42? 

A: No, no, I was -- we are talking 
now ™44, and I was allowed to go to Berlin from ti me to time , 
even though there was -- no other 
one of the girls was allowed out
. I was still se
arching for my 
father. I found he -- I found his, the pris
on, the attastrasse numb
er three, and -- 
Q: No, I™m a s king now before, before he™s imprisoned. 

A: Yeah. Oh. 

Q: A little before the assassination plot. 

A: Yes? 

Q: Cause he™s -- okay? 

A: Before? 

Q: Do -- do you hear -- d -- are people talking 
about they™re murdering 
Jews, are they saying -- 
A: Oh, yes. 

Q: You -- you know this? 

A: Of course, they were -- there were rumors but
 we didn™t -- we didn™t put too much importance 
on those rumors. But we heard 
the name  Auschwitz on the BBC.  
Q: Right, but -- but did you belie
ve what they were saying? 
A: Of course. 

Q: You did? 

A: Of course. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

A: And at that time  in our house was a Jewish
 woma n posing as a seamstress. She was Frau 
Thiele, but he r real name  was Rittenburg. And her son and -- and -- and husband had already 
been deported to Auschwitz. They were -- they di
dn™t survive. She -- she by the way is the only 
one we know by na me  that sur -- that survived in Ditte™s house. 

Q: Really? 

A: And went to England right aw
ay. And my father, after his demi
se from -- from the German -- 
from the army, with the help of Canaris, he 
escaped the concentration camp then. He was at 
home , and shortly before the 20
th
 of July he went to -- to the esta
te of -- of friends of ours to be 
away for the time, and return right after to resu
me  his planned post as a 
liaison ma n to England. 
Q: But now you -- does he know about the July 20
th
 plot? 
A: Well, he -- the -- the --  the --  the -- 

Q: His part -- 

A: -- meetings had taken place in our house. 
Q: Taken place in your house, right. 
A: And now the last question that had to be so
lved was who is going to do it?  Must be some body 
willing -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- able, and still allowed in Hitler™s presence. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because at that time  he was a full grown paranoiac, and St auffenberg was still -- still 

permitted in his presence. And there was a briefing 
that was to take place at
 hit -- at the wolf™s 
lair, his headquarters, on the 20
th
 of July, and my cu -- my cousin We rner, and he -- Stauffenberg 
and his adjutant We rner von Haften, they flew by m
ilitary plane of course, up to ca -- to -- to east 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

Prussia. And in with them they had the attach
é case with the two Britis
h ma de bombs. And full 
of hope that ma ybe this time. And they entere
d the building, but my cous in We rner was not 
allowed to enter the ro -- the conference room
. First of all, the conference was a -- a ba -- 
supposed to take place in an underground bunker, 
where the bo mb -- the explosion would have 
torn everyone to bits. At the last mo me nt, it was -- it
 was transferred to a -- 
to a -- a hut, a light 
hut, where most of the pressure went out the windows.  
Q: Right. 

A: Hitler again, because a wa -- the -- of the in
tense heat that day -- and as you know, I wa -- I™m 
not going to ta -- to -- to -- to 
talk at detail about how it then 
went, but Stauffenberg put the bo -- 
he had excused hims elf for changing his shirt or 
some thing like that before he reported to the 
führer, and had done what had to
 be done to the bombs in or
der to set them for time.  
Q: Right. 

A: And nothing could go wrong, really, nothing. So 
he -- he had been planned on the -- on this 
underground bunker now, and that. He  put it unde
rneath a heavy oak table. And then 24 -- 24 
people attended, and wa -- wa -- the -- the bombs we
re set for a certain time, so my cousin was -- 
was advised to -- to disturb, in order to get hi
m out, he was allegedly to be called on the phone. 
And Stauffe nberg went out and the two ma de it bac
k, with a chauffeured car back to the airpor t 
and on the plane to Berlin. But already on their way, they heard the explosion and they knew that 

everybody must have got -- been killed. Three pe
ople were killed, 11 were heavily wounded, but 
Hitler was not among them. 

Q: Right. 

A: He stood there, his trousers in
 -- in shreds, and one arm was  pa
ralyzed and all that, but he was 
expecting Mussolini that same  af
ternoon, visiting him, and he  ma
de it. He was bereft of his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
82 
 
 
speech for awhile, but he  again -- and he ma de it by 
the time that -- that we were home, I was -- I 
was outside of Berlin at the es
tate of a friend of mi ne, ma de 
it back to Berlin. And at my -- 
shortly after mi dnight we turned on the 
radio and there was Hitler speaking. 
Q: Right. Did you -- did you know 
about the plot before -- 
A: Oh yes -- 
Q: Before? 

A: That was the trouble. Too ma ny 
people knew, too ma ny pe ople knew. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I reme mber the day before I went to th
e countryside, be-before -- it must have been on 
the 15
th
 of July, I took a walk with my father in
 the neighborhood and from 
a lantern right close 
to our house, hung a German soldier. I was not worth dying for the führer, you know. And my ha 

-- my father had been let out of the -- H
itler™s prison. He was -- wait a mo -- no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, wrong, wrong, wrong.  
Q: You were talking about [indecipherable]. 
A: We  are now ™44. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yes, of course. And -- and we -- an-and by 
this -- by the church my
 father stood,took me  by 
the shoulders and he said, ﬁSomething is going to
 happen.ﬂ And it™ll happen tomorrow, whatever 
it was. ﬁWe have to do it, and it will -- it will not 
work. It will not -- I have 
a feeling,ﬂ he said, ﬁit 
will not work.ﬂ As Alan -- keep for -- no, forget. 
Anyway, he said, ﬁIt will not work, but we have 
to show that some  people cared.ﬂ And I knew then 
that he did not count hi
mself above this err -- 
among the survivors. And he said, ﬁWhen all is ove
r, I want you to seek your luck under another 
star. You -- and for you and your children.ﬂ 
And I™ve never forgotten that, he want -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
83 
 
 
Q: Was that the fi rst time he said that to you? 
A: That was the only time he said that to me . 

Q: The only time? 

A: Yeah. And we went home  arv -- you know, and th
en they -- there came f -- my father left for 
the Mackensan™s, and I -- I was 
visiting my cousin Ilse, I came b
ack and -- after it happened, and 
the next day at six o™clock in the morning the 
Gestapo came and searched the house. And my fa -
- 

Q: But your mother™s there. 

A: My mother is there. 

Q: And you were there. 

A: My mother is there, but I tell you some thing now
 that shows -- demonstrates the naiveté of th 

-- all the plotters. They
 were not trained mur- mu rderers, 
they were gentleme n, you know?  And 
on my father™s desk -- oh, you™re
 father™s absent. Yes, he is 
with so and so, you know. On my 
father™s d- desk is a little piece of pape r and 
on it is a telephone number. And the Gestapo ma n 
takes it, and says, ﬁWhos e number is that?ﬂ My 
mother said, ﬁI don™t know.ﬂ You know?  And -- 

and she snatches it away from hi m. And then 
he -- she tries the number, or allegedly that 
number, it was a different number, and she sai
d, ﬁI can™t get through.ﬂ And she says, ﬁYou know, 
give it to me , I™ll try from the upstairs phone.ﬂAnd upstairs she ma nages -- it was pencil written, 

to erase two of the numbers a
nd falsify them. The number was th
at of Goerdeler, who was going 
to be the head of the new governme nt. And they never found out.  

Q: [inaudible] 

A: That was my mother. Typical
. We ll, anyway, that was -- 
Q: So you™re saying that in some  wa y she 
was, if not smarter,
 more strategic? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
84 
 
 
A: Oh -- 
Q: She saw, yes. 

A: -- she was smart too, and cunning. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Cunning, yes, and -- 

Q: And also pretty brave. 

A: -- they never even took my mother in
 for -- for an interrogation, they took me . 
Q: But they took you. 

A: Oh yes, because I was -- not so much because
 I was my fat her™s daughter, but because I was 
mu -- We rner™s cousin.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But you know, I ma de them believe that I -- We
rner and I were lovers, which was not too far 
from the truth, but -- we had fallen in love as 
a ma tter of fact. And -- and sh -- you know, I -- I 
don™t know -- know about that, we ma de love, we
 da-da da-da. And they -- and, you know, my 
father had trained me , he had said, when you get 
into the hands of the Gestapo, only answer with 
yes or no. And when they get friendly, then beware. 

Q: Then beware. 

A: Then beware, yeah. And they got very frie
ndly. And I played stupi
d, and -- and during the 
second interrogation, the Gestapo ma n by the name
 of Wi pper, [indecipherable] Wi pper -- we 
never found him after the war. He called anothe
r ma n in because he wouldn™t hit anybody and 
that one let me have it. 

Q: He hit you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
85 
 
 
A: He hit me in the face with his -- with -- 
he had a -- a bo -- twice the si ze. And I was bleeding 
like a -- like a -- how
 does one bleed?  
Q: And was -- di -- did he  hit you just b
ecause he felt like hitting you, or he  was -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- asking you a question and you didn™t answer? 

A: Yeah, yeah. He didn™t even ask any question anyw
ay, he just let me  have it to prepare me  for 
the next session, you know. And then -- but then
 they let me  go. And on the way downstairs, 
cowering on a -- in a -- in a chair, I sa w a beau
tiful girl, classmate from Eberswalde, who was le 
-- the legitimate bride of my f -- my  -- my cous
in We rner von Haften. He was a big one with 
wome n, you know?  And she to this 
day, acts like his widow. I™ve ne
ver told her that he and I 
were a bit attracted to one anothe
r. And she is the only one of the family, that family, who never 
ma rried. We ll, anyway, I went home, and -- 

Q: So they -- did they believe you, that 
you were having a relationship with We rner? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: They did. 

A: I -- I only said I only know hi m pe
rsonally. I™ve not the faintest idea. 
Q: Right. 

A: And then, you know, on the 23
rd
, they came for my father. It was a Saturday or a Sunday. And 
then they came [indecipherabl
e] sie holen [indecipherable] 
Q: And this injury, how ba
d was the injury to you? 
A: We ll, I had a black eye, you know, and a s -- and a scratch from the ring. 

Q: And you -- was your eardr
um punctured, was it -- 
A: Punctured, yes. Excuse me , was t his side. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
86 
 
 
Q: It was the right side. 
A: This is my -- this is my -- this is my -- the punct ured ear. Oh, it was --  it was -- it was ter -- it 

was so humi liating, you know, and the -- you feel
 so helpless agai
nst that bru -- 
Q: Right. 

A: But I found the brute ag
ain, right after the war. 
Q: You did find him?  

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: And wha t  did you do? 

A: I reported him to the British. 

Q: And was he arrested? 

A: Yes, he was arrested, he got a few years, 
I believe, and then he di
ed, unfortunately. Wa s a 
unbelievable story. 

Q: Before we talk about your
 father™s arrest, how -- how do you understand what they were 
assassinating in assassinating Hitler? What we
re they trying to stop?  In -- as far as you 
understood, what were they really doing? 

A: As far as I understood, they were going to kill
 him, and when he was gone, getting rid of all 
the others would be child™s play. Maybe it w
ould have been, you know?  But that was the ma in 
goal, to get him out of t he picture. 

Q: And they were -- 

A: The head of the snake. 

Q: And the snake -- 

A: Was the Nazi. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
87 
 
 
Q: I -- I unders -- no, I understand that. But what
 did the Nazis mean to these people?  Because 
they were -- they were in the arm
y, they were -- they -- they were -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- part of the system. 

A: Well, it --  it -- they all had 
different motives. Some  of them
 were true anti-Nazis from the 
beginning on, joining the army whe n they were 
forced to, you know, because what else could 
you do but die, and if you died your whole fa
mily was gone, probably. And others went along, 
because they thought maybe it™s the right thing 
to do. And yet others, they really, they waited 
until it was clear the war was lost. 
So they are -- they -- they jo
ined -- and among those who died 
a mi serable death on the -- on the -- 
th-th-the piano wire, was a German general, who -- it™s -- it™s 
documented what he said, quite late, ma ybe ™42 - 
™43, he said, ﬁ Well, you 
can think about Hitler 
what you want. The only good thing is 
that he rid us of the Jews.ﬂ
 There were those people, too. 
So there were not -- and the major -- the mi nor -- 
the -- the -- the real from the heart resistor s 
were in the mi nority.  

Q: Really? 

A: Absolutely -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- absolutely. 

Q: So it™s a very mi xed -- 

A: A very mixed group -- 

Q: -- mi xed motives, yeah. 

A: -- but you know, they ma ke a 
big thing about them in Germany now. Every year they have 
ceremonies and ji -- th-the f -- on the 55
th
 -- no, o -- o -- in -- in si --
 ‚94 I went and the guest of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
88 
 
 
honor was Simon Wi ese nthal, uh-huh. And that wa
s wonderful meeting him. He was thin, so 
fragile and little. And now he™s st
ill alive, having lost his wife.  
Q: Uh-huh, right. 
A: Yeah. No, I don™t have much in common with the -- with the people of the 20
th
 of July, just a 
few ma  -- fa mily me mbers. Course the fa mily
 has tremendously grown and intermarried, you 
know. 

Q: And your father™s motives for joining this is 
clearly one™s that you™re 
telling [indecipherable] 
A: One of c onscience. 

Q: One of c onscience. 

A: Absolutely, one of conscience. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And he was ready to -- he wa
s ready to sacr ifice his life. 
Q: In order to stop this. 
A: And he knew he would have to. 
Q: Right. We have to stop  the tape and change it. 

A: Okay. 
End of Tape Five

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: Sibylle, the third day after 
the assassination, the Gestapo co 
-- your father is -- is home . 
A: My father is not home at that point. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: The f -- the -- the -- two days 
after the -- was probably on the 22
nd
 that they got me . 
Q: Uh-huh, okay. 

A: And my father came home if 
I am correct, while I was at th
e Gestapo because he saw how I 
looked. Now, I went twice -- 

Q: Really? 

A: -- that was the 21
st
 and the 22
nd
, and on the 23
rd
 they came and got him.  
Q: And they knew that he was part of this? 

A: Oh yes, yes. It was all documented, you know, 
by -- they didn™t think much of secrets. Li ke 

the -- that is German, b - -  Germanic, because th
e -- the -- if -- if they 
had not been so -- so 
thorough we would never know about how ma ny people 
di -- were killed in Auschwitz, and so -- 
it had to be -- all had to ha -- have order.  

Q: So when he was taken, did you e
xpect your fa ther to be killed? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And he probably expected that, too. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And you knew all these other 
people were being killed? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did you know -- you knew? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
90 
 
 
A: Yes, one -- one after the other. And we -- of
 course, we didn™t know then by what brutal 
means they were being killed. 
Q: Yes. 

A: And then he had -- he disappeared, nobody could find him. 

Q: And how did you find out that
 people were being killed? 
A: I went from one pr -- 

Q: No, no, not about yo -- not 
where your father is. How are 
you being informed that -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- people connected with th
e plot were being killed? 
A: I really -- all in all it
 was 5,500 people. I do not reme mber, I really -- how -- the means by 
which we were informed. I think it was probably the BBC. 

Q: But then it would be after your 
father was taken, don™t you think? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Would you --  
A: Of course. 

Q: So you d -- you don™t -- you don™t know what™s 
going on in those two days, necessarily, 
before he™s taken? 

A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, and with most of the 
people Hitler took his 
time . He put them on 
trial, trial, you know? 

Q: I see. Well -- that ™s ri
ght, yes, cause they™re s -- 
A: Only the first four were -- were -- were
 shot. Al brecht, Stauffenberg, Merzenkronheim, and 
my cousin. 

Q: Werner? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
91 
 
 
A: Werner. 
Q: Wa s shot [indecipherable] also. 

A: Yeah, Werner was shot. 

Q: He was young? 

A: We ll, not e -- just 30. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah. But like all the Brauch
itsch, he had -- his mother wa s a Brauchitsch, you know, they -- 
he looked very, very young. Young and soft, but he wasn™t. 

Q: He wasn™t. 

A: He was determined, also determined
 to sacrifice his 
life without thinking. 
Q: We re you in the house when they -- they took your father? 

A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: We re they brutal with him?  Do you reme mber ? 
A: No. 
Q: They weren™t? 

A: No, no, no, no, no. The Gestapo -- with the Jews th
ey mi ght have been brutal, not with people 
like, you know, in this case. 

Q: Even -- even s -- 

A: No, they were very -- they were very matter of fact, polite. He could take a toothbrush, or a tis 

-- a little -- pack a litt
le some thing. And then he went between them. 
Q: Even though he™s connected 
with a plot to kill Hitler? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Isn™t -- isn™t that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
92 
 
 
A: Yeah well, he did -- you know, you di -- di
dn™t know how ma ny peopl e 
were watching in the 
street. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But ah -- no. 

Q: So he takes the little bag and 
he goes, and he goes in a car? 
A: He goes down the block, across the -- a-a-aro
und the corner, they wo
uldn™t -- they wouldn™t 
park in front of the house. And there he s -- he 
is seated between two SS me n in the back, that™s 

was -- and one in the front, and the driver. And the driver turns around and says, ﬁOh my God, 

Herr Baron.ﬂ It was the taxi driver who always to
ok him to the station when he went to Holland. 
Q: So it™s a taxi driver, it™s not -- 

A: No, he had been inducted, you know, there were no taxis.  

Q: I see, so he™s inducted -- 

A: No, he had been inducted. 
Q: -- to work. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And ha -- and this is what 
your father told you after he came
 back, that that™s what happened 
in the car? 

A: We ll, he -- during the br
ief hours that I s -- I saw hi
m, yea h. Yes, of course. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know he -- when -- his release was -- 
well anyway, he was gone, he was -- he had 
disappeared, and I went then already in the -- in
 the -- in the cavalry 
and before, went from 
prison to prison, dolled up to the teeth, you know, 
high heels and -- I was 
quite -- quite pretty 
then. And I went in and I just -- 
what was my excuse?  Oh yes, I was told my father was here. So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
93 
 
 
th -- the idiotic guards le
t me  in and I was wa -- these hallways
 of the Lehrter strasse prison, that 
was the military prison. 
Q: And did you go from prison to prison 
like this?  [indeciphe
rable] find him?  
A: I went f -- yeah. No, never heard of hi m, must
 be an error. I said, 
ﬁOh well, [indecipherable] 
is all mi ne, and all that.ﬂ And th
e last prison Lehrter strasse drei
, I w -- I standing in the hall, a 

door opens of -- an office door opens and out co
me s a dashing SS ma n, black uniform. And I just 
stood there, and I see a bl ackboard with the most 
illust rous name s, and I see my father™s name. 
That was a list of the -- big, you know
, in big le -- white letters. 
And then I re -- when he came 
back he said what could he do for me , and I said, 
ﬁI -- I know my father™s 
here,ﬂ and I da da da 
da, and, ﬁCan I see him?ﬂ ﬁNo, you have to -- you ha
ve to -- you -- well, si -- fill certain for ms 
and you -- and -- and ma ybe,ﬂ -- and I got home a
nd at least we  knew where he was. So my 
mother somehow arranged -- and I do not know how
 it was possible. The first time  we  went to 
bring him things. A down -- a featherbed, I reme mber that. 
Q: Really? 
A: Cause it was -- yeah, a feather blanket, very 
light. And the most impor
tant things were the 
thermos bottles filled with real coffee. In the 
SS they ma de a sport out of it, accepting it from 
you and then dropping it. Which wa s so terr
ible, you know, but it -- 
nothing happened. My 
mother and I, we went -- we were led in -- we 
were  told we were not allowe d to use the Hitler 
salute. Terrible punishme nt. People like us, you know. 

Q: You were -- 

A: Yeah that -- we were --  

Q: -- you were not good enough. 

A: -- we were crushed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
94 
 
 
Q: Yeah, I bet. 
A: And th -- we went in and on the benches th
ere sat also wives, mothers, you know, and -- but 
we -- if we recognized anybody we didn™t let 
g -- let n -- let anybody know. So we s a t and 

waited, and from time to time, the-there was a 
little booth with a black SS ma n behind it, who 
would call out name s. And a woma n would get up w
ith her little package, spend some  time there, 
give the package, and then leave. It was our tu
rn and my mother and I 
went to the window and 
there was a ma n looking like Satan himself. R
eally, a bit like Adolf 
Eichma nn. Black, piercing 
eyes and he took the thermos bottle, examined ever
ythi ng and said, quite politely, well that was -
- that was it, and then on our -- we -- we tu
rned around and then he called me  back. Oh God, 
what have I done now?  And he said -- he didn™t 
even lift hi s eyes to mi ne, he went on writing, 
and he said, there now in th
at position, ﬁDo you have -- coul
d you -- do you think you -- next 
time you come  you have  some  more bread, or anyt
hing to eat? ﬂ  And I -- I 
went speechless, and 
he said, ﬁYou know, I have ma ny prisoners 
here who don™t have relatives.ﬂ That was 
Oberscharführer Knuth. 
Q: Knuth? 

A: K-n-u-t-h. And oh -- h-he was -- he was the 
t-turncoat too, you know?  He realized at some  
point in his career that he™d joined the wrong pa
rty. He did a wonderful thing, and by the way the 
Nazi, th -- his own colleagues took care 
of him, he  didn™t survive the war.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Wa s found out. But our friend, to be the mi ni
s -- social mi -minister of s -- Teodor Haubach, 
he was a Socialist. Dr. Haubach, a lawyer. He was 
-- he was also in Lehrter strasse. He  had been 
condemned to death and he was -- they had to 
carry him on a stretcher 
to his execution, can you 
imagine? And his -- hi s fiancé had received -- ha
d received -- which we did not, permission to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
95 
 
 
see him at Christmas, visit him in the -- in -- in
 the -- in the prison. And she went -- the way that 
I just described to you, to that window, and 
Knuth, you know, with a face
 like that, he said, 
ﬁWait a little, wait a little, until I™m rid of all th
e people here.ﬂ And then he turned to her and he 
said -- urged her ga -- s-summoned her into hi
s office, and there was a little office behind, and 
there was a Christma s tree, a burning -- with 
burning candles, and there was Teodor Haubach. 
He had arranged a farewell meeting for the two.Can you imagine that?  Must have been very 

emotional. And then he was hanged. But much emotion involved in that. 

Q: So how ma ny ti me s were you able to
 see your father 
in this prison? 
A: I d -- I never saw my father. My mo -- ba
 -- a -- to -- to gi -- to deliver things. 
Q: You could, but you couldn™t see him?  

A: I could -- no. My -- my mother only, saw him.  

Q: And wha t  did she say about 
him?  Did she tal -- tell you? 
A: Oh he -- yeah, yeah, she -- he looked terrible, 
and of course, while you were waiting there, for 
educational reasons they dragged by 
prisoners at has -- had just been
 tortured, or led to torture. 
Yeah, that wa s the way. And then one day it mu
st have -- it was on Good Friday, 19 -- oh no, it 
was -- it™s still Ma rch, and I was released from the -- from the cavalry because I ha d double 

pneumonia -- no, wa -- pleurisy -- pleurisy. And spen
t time  at home  with -- I™m glad. You know, 
it was a good idea to be with my mother, and my mo
ther had tried to free -- get my father freed 
by Kaltenbrunner. Kaltenbrunner was 
a darling. And he had not rece
ived her. And then one day 
she tried it again, sh -- that woma n went into 
-- in Berlin, to Kaltenbr
unner™s office, and -- and 
decided not to leave until she had seen him.
 And she came back, she was, you know, fi nished. 
She said that he -- when she walked into Kaltenbrunner, who decided to see her, office -- he was 

one of the worst -- he didn™t even get up to 
greet her, and let her stand. And she said, ﬁMy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

husband is a -- you know, the last survivor of four brothers.ﬂ And so on. ﬁHad nothing to do 
with,ﬂ da da da. And then he re -- she -- sh -- he
 said nothing, and then he -- she went -- she went 
home . And then on Good Friday, beginning of Ap
ril it must have been, I was home when a 
telephone came  -- telephone call cam
e to the house, we still at th
e beginning of April, had a 
working telephone. Still it went in
to the mi ddle of the -- of the month. And on the phone was my 
father, and he said, ﬁI™m free. Come  and get 
me .ﬂ And we decided -- I said, ﬁShould I pick you 
up from the prison? ﬂ  He said, ﬁNo, no, no, no, 
on the S-bahn station,ﬂ you know, the suburban 

station, on the S-bahn station, and I -- I don™t know,
 I must have flown on angel™s wings, because 
th -- ow --  the -- the --  the -- the --  the subwa
y, the buses, if they came, they came very, very 
seldom, but I -- somehow I made it and running up 
the steps to the -- th
e -- to the up -- upper 
platform. And I was mo bbed with people, I coul
dn™t find my  father, because that figure that 
stretched out his arms to me  had nothing in comm
on with my father. He was -- had a gray face, 
he was completely bloated -- he ha d a very sl
ende r face -- completely bl oa ted from the -- you 
know, from hunger, edema. He looked terrible and 
we sank into each ot he r™s arms and just cried 
and cried. And behind my father, there was a 
touching sight, was a 
young SS ma n, 16, inducted 
into the SS of course, and had tears streaming dow
n his face because of that sight. And then my 
father noticed that he had left his blanket behi
nd. That was a -- you know, pr
ecious in those days. 
So the young ma n ran back t -- and then came back with it. 

Q: Really? 

A: With the blanket, and then 
we some how ma de it home, and sl
 -- you know, slept in the cellar 
and then --  it was -- it was the --  until -- it was the 23
rd
 of April then, on the -- in the afternoon. 
Q: S-So your father is 
in prison from July -- 
A: July til April. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
97 
 
 
Q: -- July ™44, until April ™45. 
A: Yeah, yeah. And that™s -- you know, if he had not
 been in such a terrib
le condition, he would 
have had a better chance to survive what was coming to him. 

Q: And so how long then are you working with the horses? 

A: With the horse -- 

Q: It™s af -- is it after he™s arrested -- 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- that you start? 

A: September, you know? 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: After the first of September, whe n 
they closed the theaters, and I was w -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- nobody was allowe d to do nothing. And I 
was then -- in January I came down with 
pneumon -- pleurisy, and in March 
they released me , and that™s when I we nt home. And I got a 
little better, but never complete
ly better, you know, and then we
™re talking about the end of 
April, my fa ther is home . And -- and just he wa
s home  not more than five days ma ybe , three, 
five days, I don™t reme mber. And on the 23
rd
, you know, I said I would like to go f -- yeah, that 
was the reason. Potsdam had been bombed, so
me thing nobody ever expected. And in Potsdam 
was my old grandmother, my father™s mother. 
I said, ﬁI™m going to go on a bicycle and see if 
Grandma is still alive.ﬂ And I took the bicycle, 
steel helmet on, of course my -- parts of my 
uniform, tha nk God, you know. And my ortkeys. And 
some how ma de it to Po
tsdam on a bicy -- 
a bicycle. The other reason why I went was I wa
nted to see how my -- 
my horse, you know, she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
98 
 
 
was already mi ne, how she w -- wa -- w-what ha
ppened to them, because the unit that had been 
stationed in Baseco, east of Berlin, had been
 stationed -- had been moved to Potsdam. 
Q: I see. 
A: So the Russians had been in Baseco a long 
time ago. And I found my gr
andmother alive, and 
I found her -- her dis -- dip -- her com -- her ap
artment undisturbed. Her ma id, Marta was there. 
And I could tell my grandmother that her son, herlast rema ining son was alive. And then I left 

and ma de my way north of Potsda m. There were
 so ma ny cor pses right, left, and center, and 
cadavers from horses. And I ma de it to the barracks where the cavalry unit was now stationed. 

And I fell into the commanders arms and he says, 
ﬁYou can™t go back to Be
rlin, they just blew 
up all the bridges, and we are moving 
out. We are moving west.ﬂ So I -- 
Q: Wh en wa s that? 

A: -- I -- on the [indecipherable] at the head of 
the whole troop -- behind us were the Russians, 
each leading two horses, and they walked on that 
trip. And we had to go -- the temple that the -- 
that the Russians were able to go, you know?  Becau
se we didn™t lose one to lose one ma n or one 
-- or one -- or one horse. And my two favorite Ru
ssians, Fjodur and -- an
d Pawlik, they were 
walking right behind me , and I was on the horse, and the comma nder, and the ma jor and we 

walked -- we  walked west. Wa s -- it was a night al
ready. And the second night I fell asleep on a 

horse. And I woke up, had I not worn the steel helm
et on my - -  I would have cracked open like a 
coconut. On -- and I remember seeing -- 

Q: Fell off? 

A: -- Pawlik™s eyes, you know, he picked me  up and 
he said, ﬁKaput, kaput,
 nichts kaput, nichts 
kaput.ﬂ And then he lifted me  up on the horse again. 

Q: And you™re riding Arabella all this time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
99 
 
 
A: Nobody else could. 
Q: [indecipherable] nobody else, right. 

A: Yeah. Nobody else could, and then we
 finally were me t by the American 82
nd
 Airborne after 
what -- 12 nights.  

Q: Did -- did you consider
 this a liberation? 
A: Do I consider it as a -- ha! It 
was wonderful. I™d known all about the 82
nd
 Airborne. 
Q: Really? 

A: [indecipherable] oh yes, BBC, yo u know
?  And it was wonderful, it was wonderful. 
Liberation, yes. And -- 

Q: You were in Berlin when there is bom
bing?  This -- y- you were in Berlin -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- when there was a lot of bombing, right? 

A: I don™t think I mi ssed a single wa
 -- a sing -- singl
e raid, and -- 
Q: Right. That was pretty scary, right? 

A: -- I was -- well, the only one in my family 
who was never scared was my mother because she 

had the second sight, whatever you call that, no
thing™s going to happen. Nothing is going to 
happen to the house. Wh ile my father and I, and 
later on Li yala, we were scared to death by the 
bombs. And you know, it was like resurrection, surviv
ing a -- a raid. And 
fo -- wa -- you know, I 
was br-brought up to praise the bombers, you know,
 who put our -- and to -- I saw that city die 
inch by inch. 

Q: Right. 

A: It was terribly sad, but it had to be. But 
you know, I was liberated by the Americans, and the 
Russians came and there was -- one of the famous
 meetings on the Elbe, cause that -- that™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
100 
 
 
where we were, between the Russians and the --
 there was only one meeting. After that there 
were no mor e  friendly meetings. That was it. I m
ean some  of the G.I.™s almost died of the 
consume of alcohol, you know. They
 weren™t used to that, but th
at was fraternization, and I was 
be -- left behind and th -- with the Russian
s, and was -- and was liberated, saved by young -- a 
young American officer. I know his name  but I told 
him since he had a -- his rencontre with a -- 
with the army later, and receive
d a -- not for that, for other thi
ngs he did, received a dishonorable 
discharge, which to this day follows him. Could 
not rema in in the army, but he became  a fa mous  
lawyer, and after 40 years I found that he has a pr
actice in Florida. So we were reunited again. 
Yeah, and then I -- the Br itish came and then -- 

Q: How chaotic was it?  How diffic
ult were those first few months? 
A: Wonderful. 

Q: It was wonderful? 

A: It was wonderful. I was in that village, I 
was hired by the Americans 
right away to be an 
interpreter. 

Q: Interpreter, yes. 

A: Which meant that I wa s -- could be disturbe
d any day of -- any time, night and day. And you 
know, they™ve -- the famous, the most famous t hing tha -- things they found things, I™m saying, 

people that are found, were hiding SS me n. And s o me  
of the m were already half beaten to death 
by the population or by -- by their victims. So
 it was -- there was never a dull mo ment .  
Q: But when you think about the whole sit -- ma ybe
 your situation was a little bit less chaotic, 
because you need to ha -- but -- 

A: It was very chaotic, 
but very v -- very nice. 
Q: It was very nice. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
101 
 
 
A: Very nice. 
Q: Do you think it was nice for all th
e refugees that were going -- 
A: It was terrible. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It was unbelievable -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- because we saw them passed when we -- when we moved along these two -- 12 nights, 

what we passed, these -- these thous
ands and thousands of refugees, falling, and then attacked by 

the low flying planes -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and falling into the -- by 
the side of the road. How ma ny
 identification I took, you know -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- can™t even tell you. Yeah, and on the way, be
fore we were liberated, the last day before -- 
before we met with the Americans, we -- we co
llected our tri -- train, and ready to move on, and 

the officers, the -- the veteran, he was in the ra
nk of a ma jor, and I don™t reme mber his name , and 
the colonel and I, we were waiting for all the othe
rs to come  close so we could move on. When 
the SS ma n came with a -- an SS ma n came with a 
-- on a motorcycle, and he said -- asked for 
identification and he told us we had no bus
iness going west, we should go east and defend 

Berlin. Fine, great. So without a word, it wa
s only a glance we exchanged, the vet -- the 
veterinarian -- the veterinarian, a 
thin blonde ma n, and I wi -- drew 
at the same  ti me  the pistols, 
and we shot at the same  time. And he  just sl 
-- slowly was sloping over 
his bike, and we still 
heard the engine going when -- while we moved away. Yeah, we killed him. I don™t know which 

bullet killed him, but I don™
t [indecipherable] my shot. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
102 
 
 
Q: And you had no -- 
A: We had -- 

Q: -- it was a completely automa tic response on your -- 

A: -- completely, because we sho -- it sounded like one shot.  

Q: Have you ever shot? Did you ev
er shoot anything in your life? 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: You were trai --  

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- you were trained with a gun? 

A: Oh, my father taught me , of course. 

Q: This is when you were younger? 

A: Yes. 

Q: I see. 
A: I was a regular sharpshooter. 
Q: Really? 

A: So, I have a -- ma ybe I did, but ma ybe he did, I don™t know. 

Q: Uh-huh. But that™s the first human 
being you shot. That seems a little -- 
A: And hopefully the only one. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. I have one other person that I probab 
-- I caused the death of
 another person, probably 
of a Russian prisoner. My friend Pawlik, and-- you know, that we took along. He was such a 

beautiful little human being, he 
was -- looked like 16, you know, with 
-- with al -- infected eyes, 
and some times he was crying, and I said, ﬁPawlik, what
 is it?ﬂ And he said we have such a one -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
103 
 
 
in his halting German, he could speak a little 
German -- bad, bad ma n in our outfit, he is a 
commissar, a commissar. And he is giving th
em hell for being on fr iendly terms with the 
Germans. And that™s when I went to inspec
t that -- that camp, and was pointed out the 

commissar, and the next day he was gone. I don™
t know what happened to him. But Powell, and 
Fjodur, and all the others were
 very relieved. But you know, Powell never ma de it home, you 
know what happened to the -- to th
e -- to the Soviet prisoners. Th
e British, they were -- they 
ma de it safely into American hands and th
en were handed back to the Soviet -- 

Q: Oh, back to the Russians, right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And then they were killed. 

A: Well, that  is -- 

Q: But what happened to Powell, your friend -- 

A: I don™t -- 
Q: -- did he -- he didn
™t go -- did he go back? 
A: I don™t know. 
Q: You don™t know. 

A: I don™t think a single 
one of them survived. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: According to what you now know. 

Q: Now in -- in your book you talk about a lot of
 rapes that happened to wome n, and a lot of s-
sex all over the place. 

A: They raped anything that moved. 

Q: Now, you™re talking about the Russians,
 you talking about the Americans as well? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
104 
 
 
A: No, no, no, no, no. 
Q: You™re talki
ng about Russians. 

A: Russia. There were alleged rapes by -- by the 
-- the Americans, but they had been invited, 
really. But the Russians raped anything -- I thi
nk only fema le, no -- no boys were raped, was -- 
so between the ages of three and 
103. It was absolutely terrifying. 
Q: You also said your mother was never raped. Or she -- wa -- she said -- 

A: We ll, I™ll tell you -- 

Q: -- that ™s what she said. 

A: -- we -- w-we agreed in the fa
mily we wouldn™t talk about it. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But my mother knows she, and I believe he
r, that soon as the Russian -- and now she was 
alone, my fa ther was gone, you know -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- they had taken him from in front of the 
house where he was sweeping the sidewalk. A truck 
came by and collected all the me n, you know, and onl
y one came  back from [indecipherable] and 
that was our neighbor who had been in th
e party and was well fed and younger. And my 
mother™s -- 
Q: Wa it, which party had he -- had he been in? 

A: Nazi. 

Q: The Nazi party?  

A: Yeah. Across the street. 

Q: So you di -- so -- 

A: The neighbor across the street. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
105 
 
 
Q: So why do you think the Russians pi -- did -- 
do you think they picked up the -- these me n, 
including your father cause they thought
 they were Nazis or what?  You don™t know. 
A: Probably, but there are various
 theories about that. In the -- 
on the truck was an old friend of 
my father who said, ﬁI told the Russians to 
drive by your house. I™ve lost all my documents and 
now they came  to -- to arrest me , and only you can 
tell them who I am.ﬂ A
nd my father said,ﬁOf 
course, I™ll come  with you.ﬂ And my
 mother at the last mo me nt sa
id, ﬁHere is -- it mi ght be a 
cold evening, take a jacket
.ﬂ And that was the last we ever saw of hi m.  
Q: And that was the last  time -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So nobody™s -- nobody is sure wh
at this rounding up was about. 
A: Nobody to this -- to -- 

Q: This sor -- 

A: -- well later, when th
ey interrogated my father, of course 
they found out that he was a baron. 
Q: Right. 

A: Probably a spy. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Most likely a spy. 

Q: So that they were worried, huh? 

A: Ho -- wer -- but it™s all -- 

Q: Speculative, yeah. 

A: -- theoretical, yeah.  

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
106 
 
 
A: And on the 12
th
 of November, he -- his -- his bed bunk 
neighbor, a famous Ger man actor who 
survived, by the way, found him dea d on the floor. So. 
Q: So this is why Nove mber is a terrible month for you always? 

A: Yes. We  were all ta
ught to fear November. 
Q: As a bad month. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: All right, we™ll change the tape. 

A: Oh, yeah. 
End of Tape Six 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
107 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Seven 
Q: When did you find out that
 your father had passed? 
A: My father had disappeared, dissolved in thin ai
r, so to say, and there were -- was a rumor here 
and a rumor there, and there were
 little pieces of paper 
found in the ma ilbox telling us that he is 
alive, but not where and -- and a
ll that . We are talking between 
the end of April and -- and -- 
well, until he died on the 12
th
 of November. Wh at month it was I do not reme mber. Oh yes, it 
must have been after April 1946. 
I had gone over the green border, so to say, on the first of 
January 1945, to see where my mother was, you 
know, how things were in Berlin. But there 
were no official docume nts that -- that would a
llow you to pass from one  zone to the other. So I 
left  my horse in Hasseldorf with my fa mily 
there, friends, and boarded a train and some how, 

fastened by -- by some thing to the -- what do you 
call these things betw
een trains, you know, I 
mean there were -- 

Q: I don™t reme mber what you call it. 
A: -- were no room on t he train. 
Q: I don™t reme mber what you call it. 

A: Ice cold, they had -- had to hack me  loose in
 -- in -- in Berlin, I arrived there. And somehow I 
reme mber h -- the happiness when I saw American 
soldiers on the subway, it was great. But I 
knew that our house was still there. So I -- I kind
 of ran home, and there w-was my mother, very 
thin, very much alone. I mean, she had a house full of
 refugees, of course, a
nd in good spirits as I 
-- you know, of -- always collected, calm and coll
ected. And then -- yeah. Then I™d stay -- I 
stayed until -- until the first us -- 
beginning of April, 40 -- ™46, Apr
il ™46. I decided to go back to 
Hasseldorf, see how my horse is, 
and ra -- I worked for the Norddeutscher radio station as an 
announcer and I wanted to go back to my job, 
and how was it -- yeah, there was no way to get 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
108 
 
 
back, either. And so I smuggled myself into 
a refugee camp, even got food rations there, I 
reme mber. And somehow th -- th
ere was a train, like cattle cars, like the ones, you know, that 
were used to ship the Jews away. Cattle cars, 
ma ybe twen -- 10 - 20 cattle cars. And right smack 
in the mi ddle was one car reserved for the British
 -- a re-regular car -- a car reserved for the 
British who would accompany the train and tried to 
-- would try to pr otect  us agai nst the Russian 
soldiers. And at the -- at the 
checkpoint, I conversed with one. He said, ﬁYou speak English, 
you™ll be our interpreter.ﬂ And so I was very glad. 
I was allowe d to travel in the -- i -- I put my 
things in the -- in a -- in
 a -- in the cattle ca -- in
 the cattle car, and in th
e next one that was the 
British car, oh, I got a beautiful meal and beer, and 
whatever. And whatever my services were -- 
were dema nded, I did it. I did it, and you know
, g-going a stretch that nowadays by car would 

take from Berlin two and a half hours, then t
ook 24. 20 f -- more, or more. I v -- know we left in 
the afternoon at three and were there the next
 morning at seven. So, 12 - 13 - 14 - 15 - 16. And 
they s -- the sergeant, Atkinson was his name , Se
rgeant Atkinson told me  that before the border 
dividing the Russian zone from the British zone
, I should get out of the British car be cause the 
Russian soldiers would come  and inspect the Brit
ish car and they did not
 like German citizens 
mi ngling with the British, meaning 
a -- I would go into the -- into
 the car in front of us and 
pretend to be one of the -- well, 
I was one of the people. And then he would give me  a sign with 
his -- with his flashlight that 
I would come  back. And so, go th
ere and the -- the Russian guards 
come  in and they read the -- they -- they 
read the documents upside down, you know, most of 
them couldn™t read it, other than Cyrillic, if they
 could at all. And ever
yth -- they went out and 
the train begins to go into motion again. And 
I look, standing by the open door, that were not 
sealed, fortunately, I see a signal fr
om the other car. Aha, this is my
 signal and so I j -- clad with 
thick under, you know, pullovers, an
d a sheep coat, I jump down and I find no bottom and I fall 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
109 
 
 
and fall in spirals, and finally the water of th
e river closes over me, in freezing temperatures. 
There were no -- you know, the -- 
the -- the -- the -- 
the tracks were all 
dama ged, and what 
Sergeant atkin -- Atkinson had -- had tried to 
do wa s warn me  of that, but I had, you know, the 
original me ssage had been -- and I was the -- it 
was the very, very shallow river, but I came  up 
again like a cork, and saw the -- the train was 
halted, it was standing, a
nd I saw the -- all the 
British soldiers comi ng to rescue me. And they -- th
ey -- they had to wade into the water and pull 
me out. And I had a gigantic -- it™s still to s
ee here, the bump on my forehead. I had bu mp -- 
Q: Even in all your clothes you popped up? 
A: Well, the -- the -- the next second I 
would have been pulled down again, you know? 
Q: I see, right. 

A: I -- I popped up and they d -- 
they -- and then some thing ha
ppened which -- of which I was 
hav -- half -- you know, I was half conscious. An
d they pulled all the clothes from me , stark 
naked and -- and -- and wrapped me  into army bl
ankets and put me  on a stretcher there, or a 
bunk bed or whatever it was. And I was -- I was 
in a very elated mood, you know?  And captain -
- no, it wasn™t a captain -- he sat next to me  
and after about four hours 
I went into shock. And 
that was it, I started screaming and crying and 
having fits. And he knew how to handle this. He 

took my hand and kept talking to me  about his 
family in England, northern England. He was an 
electrician, I believe , or a plumbe
r, and his children and everyt hing, and by the time  we reached 
Hannover about 10 hours later or eight hours later,
 I had developed an eye like this, you know? 
Q: Huge, huh? 

A: I looked terrible, and 
everything was dry except the fur coat
, that took an extra two weeks. 
And on the platform stood the ma n I would -- wa
s -- who was responsible for me  in my job, 
Captain -- Major Clark. Major Clark a Scotsman
 from Scotland. And he t-took one look at me  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
110 
 
 
and started laughing like hell, si
nging black eyed Susan. I was not amused. And he took me  to 
the British army hospital in Hannover, they x-rayed me  and I had a concussion, of course, and 
other than that, I survived it. And 
I had very little to wear, I™ve -- 
I stayed in the castle with a -- 
with the pr incely fa mily of the Schoenaich-Carola
th, where my horse was, and I re -- was allow -
- course I had to rest for awhile, and Sergeant At
kinson gave me  the promise of what -- he went 
back to Berlin, he would visit my mo ther and tell
 her that I™m all right. 
And then he took another 
four weeks or so, I reme mber it must have been
 May or June that he 
came back, carrying a big 
suit, I was -- I -- he came with a Jeep, carrying 
a bi g suitcase that was for me , with clot hes. 

Clothes, you know, I didn™t even know what clothes were, I only had those riding boots. And he 

said -- I took him to the park, it was a beautifu
l day, and he was so in aw
e by all the --  the -- the 
royal highnesses and -- and wh-whatever. We  we nt 
to the park and he said, ﬁI have very bad 
news for you. Your father is dead.ﬂ And then he sp
illed out the story that 
had just gotten to the 
ears of my mother, over a year af
ter -- after my father had been
 taken away, what had happened 
to him. So that™s how we found out, and later my  
si -- my brother would find out that this -- this 

fa mous actor, Berlin™s you know, he was the ma
nager of the Staatsthe
ater, Gustaf Gründgens, 
had been acco -- a friend of my -- had been ther
e when my father was -- died. And I™m s -- was 
died. And I am so grateful the two had each other,
 because they -- they ha
d a lot to -- to talk 
about. And he told the story, but he  -- very re
luctantly because the Russians had released him 
under the provision that he would never talk what 
happened to him in the -- in the ca -- in the 

camp. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So he broke the promise. He died shortly
 after, but a natural 
death, so that™s it. 
Q: So that must have been a -- that [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
111 
 
 
A: That™s how we found out. 
Q: Then that must have been a really big shoc
k for you, given how close you were to your father. 
Or did you expect it? 

A: We ll we -- we gave up all, then we 
had to go -- gave -- give up all hope. 
Q: So you gave it up before? 

A: We  had, really. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: We  really had. But now we had confirma tion, and -- 

Q: Sure, yes. 

A: -- closure. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, closure. And the -- this actor, Gust
af Gründgens, after my father died, saw to it 
personally, together with other pr
isoners, that my father, who was very mu ch respected -- my 
father had turned politically mu
ch mo re to the left than a
nybody would have thought. You know, 
he would have wound up a social democrat, you 
know, and not a rightist any more. Rightist, no 
he was never a rightist, but the si
 --  the Nazis were rightists. A
nd he was highly respected and to 
this day I get do -- not to
 this day, for years I got me ssages fr
om hi -- how wonderful he was, and 
how well he behaved, and well anyway, he saw to 
it that my father was not thrown into a mass 
grave, but has a single gr ave in Jamlitz, somewhere. I mean if I was to inspect a thousand skulls 

there, I would have found my father™s because 
of the shrapnel wound in the first World Wa r. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: But we never tried, we  never, you know -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
112 
 
 
A: -- they dug up corpses there and 
they gave it up. What™s the use? 
Q: What™s the use? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: Well. 

Q: So now your brother™s a
live, this you found out, yes. 
A: My brother, I was at the Hasseldorf castle when one morning while I wa s asleep, the door 

opens, the pr incess stands there and said, ﬁSome
body to see you.ﬂ That was my little brother, you 
know. And he worked on the farm then, you know, befo
re he went back to Berlin, and in Berlin 

he eventually was one of the f
ounders of the Frei University. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes, yes, because the Humbol
dt University, he was not the 
son of a laborer, refused him.  
Q: Right. 
A: And everybody else who was not a laborer™s
 son. And then he founded the univ -- the 
university, became a lawyer. 
Q: And how is your mother right after the 
war?  Are you -- do -- do you go back to her once 
you™ve -- once you™re better, 
do you go back to Be rlin? 
A: Oh yes, frequently, then I™ve -- I™ve -- I™
ve moved back to Berlin. I mo ved ba -- 
Q: But when do you ma rry the first tim
e?  When you have [indecipherable] 
A: I -- oh, I married -- not for awhile. 

Q: Not for awhile, okay. 

A: Not for awhile. I -- I was, you know, still unde r th
e illusion that after th
e war, things will be 
all di fferent. The Nazis will be dealt with and 
all the anti-Naz is would come  up and rule the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
113 
 
 
country, you know?  It didn™t quite happen that
 way, the Nazis had it 
good, and those de-Nazi 
vacation trials, I beg your pardon, you know. We re 
nothi ng but a farce. So I went to work in 
Berlin, in a famous orga nization, 
it was of course ba -- institut
ed by the Americans, by the CIA. 
The Fighting League Against Inhuma nity. And I was 
one of the first people there, and then they 
some how did things that the Americans di -- I didn™t like either, a
nd then I -- but I -- I 
interviewed, interrogated more
 people than you can shake a stick at. You know, refugees. 
Clearing them -- are they political, or  are they no
t?  None were sent back
 but the ones who could 
prove they were political prisoners, they left
 for political  reasons, that their lives were 
endangered, they received extra help from the 
Americans. Taken by plane from West Germany 
and so on. That was the time  when they came by 
the thousands before the -- the wall wa s built. 
Q: Now, did most of the people you speak with, y
ou think they were -- they were just trying to 
leave the east and come west? 

A: You had to -- you had to use your judgment and 
I have a very good instinct. I could tell by the 
way a man entered a room. 

Q: Who he was. 

A: But once -- I describe it in my book. A ma n -- a 
gentleman, mi ddle aged, enters the room, sits 
down and tells me  his real name . Doktor R
eckzeh [indecipherable]. Doktor Reckzeh was 

responsible, he was a Nazi spy, was responsible fo
r the death of at leas
t 30 people, a terrible 
death, because he had attended the famous Thadden 
tea party. A woma n by the name  of Fraülein 
Fron Thadden, who was the headmi stress of a famous
 girl™s school, had invited people who then 
was living in Berlin, had invited people for a tea 
party and independent of 
each other, al -- my 
mother almost went, and the Countess [indeciphera
ble] almost went. Both held back, you know, 

by some thing that could not be explained. And gue
st of the party and the only ma n was a very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
114 
 
 
nice young man by the name -- he was a medical doc
tor, and he was allowed free access to and 
from Switzerland and people who wanted to give
 him me ssages should do it, he would gladly 
take them. And he wasn™t Gestapo spy and 
he denounced all of them. And Fraülein Fron 

Thadden at a ripe old age, was beheaded. And 
-- and many -- all the -- 
all the -- all the people 
were -- were hanged. And I -- right away I register
ed, I knew who that man was, even ma ybe my  

face gave me away, I don™t know. And we talked, and 
then I -- excuse me , as I said, ﬁI have to go 
the next room, just one mo
me nt.ﬂ And I said to the pers -- ﬁC
all the police, call the police right 
away.ﬂ And by the time  I came back, he was gone. 

Q: Was gone. 

A: And he went back into the Russian zone, wh
ere he wa -- they gave him a wonderful life, 
anyway, I don™t know why he ever wanted to leave. He was a doctor and had a beautiful home  

with a sky high wall around it, and I never knew 
what happened to him. He reported his own 
daughter to the Russians for being anti-Communi
st. Yeah, nice guy. Yeah, I mi ssed that boat. 
Q: So he could move fr om one group to anothe
r, it didn™t ma tter, as
 long as he was -- 
A: Oh yeah. And then, you know, the leader of 
the place was Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt. He was 
terribly naïve, too. And of course we had all th
e Communist spy we could 
meet in our office, so 
we sent our spies into the cowa
n -- the Communist side. And then 
I left and then I -- I decided 
with the Nazi  time, and I say it in these words,
 some thing wonderful had 
broken with the end of 
the war. The ti --  feeling of togetherness with
 all the people who were against the regime . 

Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Co
mmunist, monarchy, didn™t ma tter. They -- for the mo me nt of the 
end, each we nt in hi s own separate direction ag
ain. And that would neve r, ever be the same  
again. That I really mi ssed. Everybody mi ssed it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
115 
 
 
Q: So there was a mo me nt when it didn™t ma tte
r who you we re, as long as you were against the 
Nazis?  
A: It didn™t, 
no, it didn™t -- 
Q: And then -- and then -- 

A: -- as long as some body -- 

Q: -- people split again. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: They went into their old accust omed directions. 

Q: Right. 

A: And that™s when I -- I -- you know, our fa mily 
-- and I describe my friendship with -- I called 
her Aunt Edith and Uncle Otto, he -- Jewish, but
 Christians for centuries. And they had been 
dragged to Theresien -- Terezín, and they had been
 -- had survived Terezín 
and went to America, 
then ba -- went back to Berli
n, and she had her son from her first ma rriage, who was then chief 
of staff of the children™s hospital in -- in Detr
oit, Michigan. He came to
 visit and he said, ﬁWhy 
don™t you come  to the United States?ﬂ Ah, that 
was the mo me nt when I woke up in the mor -- 
mor -- morning and said to myself, ﬁI™m going to
 the Stat es.ﬂ And my -- my little ba -- I had 
already been divorced, and my litt
le boy was not well. So he had 
been prescribed a time in a 
climate where he would heal, you know, lungs and 
everything. It did the job, but what would I 
do when -- you know, I gave myself those six mo nths
, that I would go to the States and establish 
a -- an existence somehow. 

Q: And then bring him over. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
116 
 
 
A: And I -- I did, and my  mother brought the 
boy, and I -- in New York
 they had told me 
newcomers need seven years to get accustomed to 
new y -- I needed one hour. All it took. This is 
my city, you know. 

Q: And of c ourse you had -- 

A: I had English. 

Q: -- the English language. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Which made all the di fference. 

A: So I got a -- got a wonderful position with NBC right away. 

Q: Right away. 

A: That™s where I met -- later met my husband number two. 

Q: Right. Now husband number one, when did you get ma rried? 

A: We  got ma rried in January of ™52. 
Q: Uh-huh, okay. 
A: We worked together for the American newspa
per, the [indecipherable] 
in -- in -- in Munich. 
He was a journalist. Son of a Jewish mo
ther, by the way, who had muddle d through. 
Q: The war. Let me  ask you again about the Leag
ue Against Inhuma nity. You said there were 
things that the Americans we
re doing that you didn™t like. 
A: Not, not the Americans, that group was doing, yeah. 

Q: That group was doing, I see. 

A: You know, unnecessarily sending people into the Russian zone, just to -- to put an F on the 

wall somewhere, which mean fr imins -- Frei heit, fr eedom. 

Q: Freedom, uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
117 
 
 
A: And stuff like that. 
Q: But I thought they we re
 an anti-Communist group? 
A: It -- there was -- they we
re the anti-Communist group. 
Q: So why would this -- 

A: And -- and then, you know, on their staff -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- they had a ma n tha -- he wa -- came  after 
me, long after me , and he c o me s in the door and I 
say to myself, SS. Sure enough. Yes, but -- and 
I went to the -- the ma nager, Dr. Rainer 
Hildebrandt, I said to him, ﬁH
ow ca n you do that? ﬂ  He said, ﬁH
e knows how to put up a new file 
system and all that, isn™t that 
great? Good-bye.ﬂ And I was furious 
with him, but actually there 
was a reason why the Americans, together with Willy Brandt, they decided to dissolve that 

group, but that was long after I had gone. Bu
t while I was there it was interesting. 
Q: We re you anti-Communi
st most of your life? 
A: It was no issue during the Nazi time . 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And before the Nazi time  I was too small. 

Q: Yeah, no, no, clearly. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: And then, you know, I -- I was -- if I was anti-
Communist, I was never as
 anti-Communist as 
a -- I was anti-Nazi . 

Q: Nazi, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
118 
 
 
A: I mean to -- of course we -- thanks to the Communist threat , erlof -- I -- Adolf Hitler came to 
power. No, I™ve never really gi ven it a
ny -- ma  -- my husband, you know, who accepted the 
Lenin o -- oden -- and stuff like that, he said, I 
am accepting declarations from anyone if it for -- 
is -- is -- if it™s for the sake
 of peace. But he would never cease to speak his mi nd when the 
Russian delegation, th-the -- the 
-- and then east German delega
tion came to the house, the talk 
was -- of course I kept my -- my mouth shut, 
h-he said, ﬁYou know, I™m a -- Germany -- We st 
Germany is only a colony of the American
s.ﬂ And my husband, you know, shook his head and 
said, ﬁYeah, just like East Germ
any is a colony of the Soviets.ﬂ 
Q: Yes, absolutely. 

A: And then he predicted the downfall of 
worldwide Communism so early you would never 
[indecipherable] in 1975. 

Q: And you -- you™re talking about your third husband. 

A: That is my third husband, of course -- 
Q: N -- N -- Niemoeller, that™s right. 
A: -- yeah, my third husband. My second husband
 -- no, he -- they all died. I™m a threefold 
widow. 

Q: And your first husband you ma rried from ™
52 until you leave, or you were [indecipherable] 
A: No, until ™54, I couldn™t take hi
 -- I couldn™t stand him any more. 

Q: I see. 

A: He was a very interesting ma n, but we were 
too different. And I couldn
™t frankly see myself 
staying in Germany, nor could I 
see my son staying in Germa ny. 

Q: Uh-huh. And was your -- was your s
on close to him, or was he -- 
A: No, he was a baby. He me t hi m later. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
119 
 
 
Q: He did meet him?  
A: Yeah, yeah, of course, several times. 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: But didn™t particularly care for him. I -- I f -- 
I took his father from hi m, but I furnished him 
with two good stepfathers. Husband number two, he
 was not very effective, and he was a very 
mi xed up and confused and diffi
cult person. He was very good to
 my son, very good. We ll, my 
son ma de it very easy for him to [indecipherable]
. And then Martin Niemoeller and he, that was 
love on first sight. 

Q: That was [indecipherable] 

A: Not on first sight, on second sight. 

Q: On second sight. And your s -- your sec ond husband, you -- you me t him when you were 

working at NBC -- 

A: Right. 
Q: -- when you came to the United States in ™56. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: I me t him in ™58. 

Q: Ah, in ™58. 

A: And we ma rried in ™59. 

Q: Okay. So you were married for nine years. 

A: Then I was ma rried for -- on paper for over 10 years, which ma de a great difference -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- because I™m getting survivor benefits.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
120 
 
 
Q: I see. 
A: Yeah, and how. You know, I th
ink of Ross Donaldson, I reme mb
er him with a -- with very 
mi xed feelings, you know, gratitude is among them. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because that™s a ni ghta -- nice addition to mySocial Security, to my pension that  I receive 

from Martin. 

Q: You™ve had ma ny relationships in your life. 

A: I had ma -- relationshi ps because people interest me. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I had relationships with ma ny completely diffe
rent people on different levels. I have -- and I 
can say that -- not with pr ide, but with hum
ility, I™ ve been loved by great men, and I™ve loved 
great men. I™ve never -- in all my life, I™ve rea
lly never been out of love to this day. 
Q: That™s great. So now where do I go?  All right.What is happening to you?  You come to the 
United States, and you™re with more Jewish peop
le, probab -- perhaps, since you™re living in 
New York, you™re involved 
in theatrical or  --   
A: Not yet. 

Q: -- entertainment. Not yet. 

A: Not y -- oh, no, no, I was -- I have that position, 
but I had a small apartment on Blist, 25 We st 
95
th
 Street. And I shared the floor
, were two apartments, with a Jewish student from -- from 
Israel . 

Q: With Leah? 

A: Leah. And Leah taught me  the first things about Judaism. And all the time  I was in New 

York, aside from [indecipherable] I had a feeli
ng I™d been there before. When I went to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
121 
 
 
Jewish qua -- the Jewish quarters, which was abou
t to be dissolved really, in Lower East Side, 
that™s -- that™s -- that™s my 
people, that™s my youth. It was very strange. And you know later, 
when I had to learn Hebrew -- you have to learn 
Hebrew in order to convert, and it came so easy 
to me . You know the Sh™ema  Israel, w
ithin the two days I knew it by heart. 
Q: So you begin to become  comfor
table. Is this -- does yo -- 
A: I was never uncomfor t able with Jews, never. 
Of course, I mean, I was always overprotective 
of Jews, you know?  My father, you know, I reme mber, 
when -- if the word Jew fell at the table, I 
saw him, his  ears going up. Can we help?  S
hould we help?  Where?  When?  And so on.  

Q: Mm-hm. No, I don™t mean that you were uncomfo
rtable with Jews, or not uncomfortable with 
Jews, but rather the notion that you should be part
 of this tradition, as opposed to part of the 
Christian tradition -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- come s later to you. This is not some
thing you think about 
in the 40™s, right? 
A: No, we had other th
ings to think about. 
Q: Right, right.  

A: A-Absolutely. 

Q: Right. 

A: Every day was filled with -- 
was import -- every mi nute was important that you survived, that 
you had a piece of bread, that you -- 
you had this, or that. No, no, no, 
that -- that really came to 
be of an issue when I arrived in New York. 

Q: Right. But your divorce come s in 1969, right? And you remeet -- 

A: I don™t -- yes. 

Q: -- Martin Niemoeller -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
122 
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- who was comi ng to the Unite

A: Right, on the 20

Q: Before you see him, do you recall 
this childhood crush that you had? 
A: Of cour -- 

Q: You have never lost it? 

A: Never lost  it -- 

Q: Never lost  it. 

A: I™ve never lost it. And I see myself, you know, 
all cried out over the la

Ross left for Hollywood and didn™t leave me  a pe

lawyer and all that. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I was wearing a red suede dress in the

over the phone after I read in the newspaper th

over the phone and the voice sounded so fa miliar to me . And he said, ﬁWhy not have lunch with 

me  t o mo r r o w ? ﬂ   

Q: And he reme mbered you? 

A: And then he -- I arrive  at the Gramercy Park 
Hotel, and there were only, in the foyer, the two 
-- that I knew on -- on what floor 
he was, let™s say it was the 14
th
 floor. And I see the elevators 
stop, knowing he was as punctual as I am, you kn
ow, and going down. It come s to me  finally, w-
w-w -- will he recognize me ?  Will -- wh-what will
 I say, how will I call him, you know. And the 

door opens and there stands, with a world wide, you know, smile, this be
autiful old ma n with 
whi -- snow white hair, br own face. I always said to
 him, ﬁDon™t stay in the su -- in the sun too

long, or in the south they™ll put you in the back 
of the bus.ﬂ You know, becau
se he was getting so 
-- so tanned. And he -- clad in an elegant suit, 
gray suit, with a wine burgundy -- what the British 
call waistcoat. And he opens his arms and he sa
ys in German, ﬁYou haven™t changed a bit.ﬂ And 
that was the beginning of 
a beautiful friendship. 
Q: And we have to stop the tape.

Q: So Sibylle, the elevator opens and who come s out? 
A: There stands a ma n who doesn™t ga -- move fi
rst, opens his arms, and at some  point he took 
me  in his arms and says, ﬁYou™ve not changed one bit.ﬂ And I was so impr essed by, you know, 

an old ma n and an old ma n are not the same , not
 necessa rily. And he was full of vigor and he 
took me  to lunch, and it was beautiful  lunc
h. First of all, it was Hitler™s bi rthday. 
Q: It was April 20
th

A: Yes. And it was also -- would have been the 49
th
 wedding anniversin -- versary of him and 
Elsa. 

Q: Who had died in a crash -- car crash. 

A: Who had died seven years befo -- five years 
before in that horribl e car crash in Denmark. 
Q: So that was quite a lunch. 

A: Yeah, that was quite a lunch and 
it -- some how it clicked right away.  
Q: But tell me  some thi ng, it™s been 
40 -- you haven™t seen him since 1930 -- 
A: Between ™37 and -- and -- 
Q: Sevent --  

A: -- 41 years -- 31 years.

Q: And you hadn™t changed a 
bit, huh?  That™s g -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- that ™s a great line. 

A: Isn™t that great? You 
haven™t changed a bit. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: And he was so needy for -- for love, for aloving partner. You know, 
Hitler knew exactly what 
he did to him when he put him in solitary. He 
wouldn™t have suffered had he been with others. 
But having it -- he was used to sharing every t
hought with some body he c a red for, who cared for 
him. And he couldn™t do that fo
r so ma ny years, that was -- 
Q: For so many years, right. 

A: -- that was brutal. Of course, 
Elsa was -- Elsa™s attitude was 
that of the pe -- women of the 
generation above me . There was no talking back, a
nd when there were -- wa
s -- pr -- his -- hi -- 
her way of protesting was to si
t in a corner and cry. While I 
-- I viciously attacked him.  
Q: You did? 

A: You know?  And that™s what he loved. That™swhat he loved. He had these famous , infamous 

temper tantrums. They would flare up and he w
ould insult you, whatever, and it was over. And 
he expected the other one to forget that ri
ght away, you know. Person couldn™t, all the time. 
Q: You tell a story of at one
 point he does this and you st
art -- your son come s up -- 
A: And that was right after my son had move
d in with us. You know, we had -- we had got 
ma rried and I had put him -- he was -- had been th
rown out of several schools, among them the 
Kennedy school in -- in -- in Ber
lin, where I was for the first y-y
ear and then I ma rried Martin -- 
or I ma rried Martin only in ™71, because my di
vorce wasn™t legal. I 
had a Mexican divorce. 
Q: So when did -- when did you -- when
 did you actually meet
?  Wa s it ™70?  69? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
126 
 
 
A: Meet?  ™68.

Auschwitz, also Hitler --

Martin stepped in my life in April. 

Q: And did you know then that you wanted to marry him?  

A: I -- some thing in me  must have se -- ther
e must be some  sense in our meeting, you know, 
because he was so -- he was so alone. He had 
so ma ny wome n, he -- he wa s very attractive for 

wome n, I can tell you that. But i-it -- he said th
e key word for me , you know, when I visited him 
once in Wi esbaden, took me  out to a beautiful dinn
er, and I had asked him, I said -- he had asked 
me  to call him Martin, which I found extremely difficult. 

Q: What were you calling him?  

A: Pastor Niemoeller, of course. I said, ﬁHow 
come  that you have stayed single now for so ma ny 
years?ﬂ And soon as I said that I 
said to myself, I shouldn™t have 
asked that question. And he just 
smiled, and once we were out of the -- out of th
e restaurant, the hotel a
nd walking, the snow was 
falling, it was like in a fairy tale. Wa s only N
ovember. And he stopped and looked at me ; he 
looked so cute. And he said, you asked me  a que
stion, and because, you know, I™m a ver -- I™m -- 
and Elie Wi esel says the same  thing. I™m very, very shy. So he would never have done the first 

step. He had legions of wome n a
doring him. So I took that, and 
I kissed him. And that was it. 
Q: And that was it. 

A: We  were engaged by the time we reached his house, yeah. 

Q: Yes? 

A: Absolutely. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
127 
 
 
Q: Absolutely. He was just waiting for that. 
A: He was just waiting for that
, and he -- he -- he enjoyed havi
ng an exotic wife. How often was 
I asked -- no, his siblings were all alive, and th
ey were all -- he was -- he was his -- the bigger, 
the -- the -- the older brother. And whatever he do
es or says is all right
. Now he™s ma rrying that 
butterfly?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: All right, we™ll sanction it. 

Q: And they were okay. 

A: His -- his children, was mi xe
d e motions, you know, the girls. 
Q: But did they reme mb er you?  Cause you played -- 

A: Of course, I have -- I have -- 

Q: -- you played with them. 

A: -- I™ve always been in touch with them. 
Q: Right. 
A: And there were the mi xed e motions, especi
ally the daughters, who loved their father, you 
know, a little too much. And they 
were beastly to me , 
but I -- I won them over, I won them all 
over. 

Q: And was part of the problem that
 you were closer in age to them?  

A: Of c -- 

Q: It was that. 

A: I was twice divorced, I was an American. 
I used lipstick and other horrible me ans of 
beautifying myself. 

Q: I see. And you were young. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
128 
 
 
A: And they alway -- yeah, and -- and I was as
ked the question, are you still an American? And I 
said, ﬁYes, and I™m going to be one for the rest of 
my life.ﬂ Because that is
 something that is not 
for sale, for anything. And Martin, of 
course he -- he -- he loved it. 
Q: He did? 

A: And -- yes, and be -- being seated in a rest
aurant, when the waiter asked what his daughter 

wanted, was me , you know, he would kick me  under 
the table. Wa s very wise of him to ma rry a 

woma n that much younger. He would have died. 
During our ma rriage he would have died ma ny 
times for neglecting himself and his -- his -- hi
s health, you know?  He would not go to bed when 
he should -- 

Q: I™m sure he didn™t ma rry you because -- 

A: No, no, no, I was very stri 
-- I was called the dragon, you know? 
Q: By who m?  

A: By all the people that I 
tried to get off his back.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: He couldn™t say no. And -- when he had the fl u 
he was in bed, and I did the right things for 
him, ma king him get up, for instance, and walk 
around. Medicine in Germany was, and still is 30 
years behind. 

Q: Wa s it difficult for you to move back? 

A: I never moved back. 

Q: No, well, physically you moved back. 

A: Physically no, because I knew I was comi ng to a very Ame r icanized town, Wi esbaden. The 

Air Force headquarters was still 
there, the hospital was there.
 And all through my years in 
Wi esbaden, I have not ma de one German friend. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
129 
 
 
Q: Really? 
A: No, because as Martin™s wife, that was -- he
 di dn™t ha ve friends either. He had people who 
either loved him or despised him. And on hi
s own level there was nobody, so he took all my 
friends in. The entire staff of the hospital came 
Sunday after church for instance, for a drink and 
a cigar. And he -- Martin™s -- 
Martin™s English was fl awless. 
Q: Really? 

A: He spoke with a German accent, stronger 
than mi ne, but his -- it was -- when he -- 
Q: And -- me -- go ahead. 

A: -- when he composed a -- a sermon, there wa
s nothing I had to change
. Not even a comma. 
Q: And wha t  did you speak with each other?  German, or -- 

A: Both. 

Q: Both. 

A: Both, yeah, both. And we had our political -- ou
r political vi ews that  was very di -- were -- 
were very different. He was naïve in ma ny 
ways. And one of these days, you know, it was -- 
started off as nothing, and all of a sudden my husb
and has a -- has a tantrum. He™s still seated at 
the desk, and he begins to tr
ample with his feet, scream. 
Q: Really? 
A: And I went to the door, and 
I sh -- screamed up, ﬁMarc, co
me  down, c o me  down, you have to 
see that.ﬂ And he was not even -- his father wa
s not even aware of it. So Marc came  down and 
we start laughing in th
e back you -- the tears were comi ng 
from our eyes. We were going down 
to the -- on the floor, and all of a sudden ther
e was complete quiet and after he stopped howling, 
he turned around and saw us -- 

Q: Laughing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
130 
 
 
A: -- dissolved in laughter and tears. And what 
does the ma n do?  He starts laughing with us. He -
- that was typical, typical. Once hi
s sister was there when I had a
llegedly insulted him.  When she 
descended on me  like an eagle, 
you know?  ﬁYou cannot speak like th
at to my brother.ﬂ And he 
turns on her and says, ﬁI love that about her, 
you know.ﬂ His wife Elsa 
would never have dared 
that, it wasn™t done. 
Q: So -- so was -- was -- was he able 
to stop the tantrum sooner because -- 
A: It stopped itself, he was spent. 

Q: Because you were not respondin
g, and -- and stimulating it. 

A: No, because -- of cour se, of course . 

Q: Right. 

A: There was nothing i -- he was -- he h
eard funny noised in the background, you know? 
Q: Did you write to each other between ™68 
and when you went over there, when -- 
A: I have collected about 70 love letters from
 hi m. Nobody i s  getting them, no. My son has -- 
will have them. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Handwritten. 

Q: This is before you™re married? 

A: We wrote to each ot her every day practically. 

Q: Really? 

A: Every other day. 

Q: And do you have your letters to 
him, or only his letters to you? 

A: I have his letters -- my
 letters to him, too. 
Q: Too, you have both. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
131 
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Under lock and key. He wrot
e beautiful letters. But 
yes, he was shy. There 
was only one woma n in his life and that was Elsa. 
Q: Right. And then there was a second one. 

A: And he knew very little about wo
men. Amazingly little. Didn™t matter.  
Q: This was your best ma rriage. 

A: The only one. 

Q: Or the only one, yeah. 

A: The only real ma rriage yes. And God gave 
us so ma ny ye ars together, you know, thinking -- 
the ma n was  79 when I ma rried him. 

Q: And you were f -- 

A: I was then 46. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the church -- his successor™s successor, I 
cou -- I -- before we were married, I -- I wanted 
to find out about my status, you know?  I had ma rried
 him aft e r he was retired, so there would be 
little money. There is not much mone y now, but 
th-they did the best they could with me. 
Q: Right. 

A: They really -- the chur ch of Hessen and Nassa
u carried me  on angel™s wings, I can™t say it any 
other way. And after my conversion, ah, 
was marvelous the way they behaved. 
Q: Intere sting. 

A: And also most -- th-the children. The child
ren were pretty good excep
t for ma ybe one of -- 
but they wouldn™t say anything to me , but I know they disapproved. 

Q: They disapproved. 

A: Which is their right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
132 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Absolutely. 

Q: And they didn™t adjust
 during all those years? 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no. They™ve all been very composed about it -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and very -- my, of course my -- my fa
vorite child, Niemoeller child is Ha mmon, after 
Joachim, who fell in the war. The oldest one, he 
is six years younger than I am. And he is my -- 
he is my buddy, and he is the most talented -- al
so me dical doctor, of all his children. He plays 
the piano -- I mean, concert, you know. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And he -- 

Q: Besides Joachim, there was another child who 
died of diphtheria, isn™t there, early on? 
A: Yeah, that was Utë. She was the most gorgeous 
of them a ll. But Utë™s death he heard in the 
conce -- in Dachau. [indecipherable] 

Q: Right. And he could 
not go to the funeral. 
A: No, not only that, but the 
g -- the SS guard stopped him i
n, you know, a hall going from one 
cell to the other, they were allowed to visit later --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- oh by the way your daughter died. Which 
one?  I don™t know [indeci
pherable] don™t care, 
either. And then after a fe w days that must have
 been hell, he always 
hoped, he says, that it 
would be Utë because he had a guilty conscience 
towards the other children because he showed 
his preference to Utë all the time . Sh
e was an angel, she really was.  
Q: Really. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
133 
 
 
A: Gorgeous looking, wi se beyond her years. Andit was Utë. And then his -- his favorite son 
Joachim, the only one who wanted to go into the -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- into -- into the 
-- theology, he fell -- and he knew it be
fore he went out. He was only 19. 
And I knew them all, I knew the entire family -- 

Q: Right, yeah. 

A: -- of course. But they are dying out now, you 
know?  This -- well, the 
oldest daughter, who 
was my grimmest fiend, she lives in Connecticut. Bu
t she is so far gone mind-wise, that I hesitate 
to call her. We are friends, I mean, she -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And all the children who are fair, they real
ized that without me  he would have died.  
Q: Much earlier. 

A: They would have lost their father ma ny ti
me s, cause he didn™t take care of himself. 
Q: Right. And he was 92 or 93 when he passed. 

A: 92. 

Q: Two -- 92. Let me  ask you some t hing, did --did -- did you two talk about his years in 

concentration camp, and what he -- 

A: Never once, but not because he blocked it out like you know, so ma ny survivors. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And I count myself a mong those survivors, havi
ng not been able to talk for 40 years. Four 
zero years. If Elie hadn™t kvetched 
that out of me , you know, I would be quiet to this day. He had 
worked it through over the years. He
 was at peace with himself about it. He  only -- people, some  
people would ask him, was it really so bad?  And 
he would have one stereotype answer, he would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
134 
 
 
say, ﬁNo, it was a thousand times worse.ﬂ And that™s all he -- all he
 said, he would never -- he™d 
cut you off very briefly. And so I wouldn™t -- 
Q: So did he -- okay, so that -- there™s some th
ing about him not talking about his own private 
pain or his experience. But what about the war a
nd the Holocaust and what the Nazis did?  Did he 
talk about that? 

A: Of course, I mean he -- he opened his mouth after -- and I quote him I think in my book, in 

my -- both my books, I quote him as saying in -- in -- 
as declaring that he -- 
he thinks the church 
is -- of all the institutions and the people to bl am
e, the church holds the 
biggest responsibility for 
not having done anything. And he never excluded hi
ms elf, never. Oh, he was very, very aware of 
it. You must reme mber, there is a ma n, who unlike me , had be en brought up in the anti-Se mitic, 

anti-Jewish -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

A: -- attitude of the Protestant clergy. 
Q: Right. And -- 
A: He was -- he was the Christ killer
 The Jew, that Jew was the cri -- 
Q: To him?  

A: Sure. My Anna, my old nanny, she went throu
gh all the anti-Nazi things we did, but in her 
heart she rema in an anti-Semite. So often I sa
id, ﬁAnna, think about it
, why? ﬂ ﬁThey killed 
Jesus.ﬂ Would not fo -- close her ears, so. 

Q: So it™s a very interesting combina
tion that you can both be anti-Nazi -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- but anti-Semitic. 

A: Oh yes -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
135 
 
 
Q: And not care that this part -- 
A: -- and that was done by ma ny. 

Q: -- that  this --  

A: Right. 

Q: Right?  

A: But then he -- he real ized the full impact 
of his own anti-Semitism only after the war, of 
course. 

Q: And did it take him a long time, do you think? 

A: No, he had a -- some thing happened to him when he, for the first time as a free ma n, with 

Elsa, visited Dachau concentration camp.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Wa nted to show her, you know, and the Amer ican officer. 

Q: Right. 
A: Because they kept the camp. 
Q: Right. 

A: And the only block that was standing, as a pr
ison for their own G.I.™s, you know, for all sorts 
of things, from murder to black market. And he 
finds himself standing in front of the crematoria, 
and so the crude sign, you know, board of s-some
thing, on which it said, here so and so ma ny 
inma tes were killed between 1933 and 1945. And ther
e, he says -- and he -- I -- I can quote him, 
I don™t know if I can do it now by heart, ve rbatim, 
he said, ﬁIt wa -- like a cold chill came da -- 
went up my spine. I heard God™s voice saying tome ,ﬂ -- wa -- well, you know, he said, ﬁI knew I 

had an alibi between 1933 -- between 1937 and 
1945. But here God was asking me , where were 

you between 1933 and 1937, and I had no answer. Cain,where is your brother Abel?ﬂ And that™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
136 
 
 
when he fully realized that he bore the same
 a mount of responsibility, eight years of 
concentration camp or not. He was -- and wh
en people accuse him now of anti-Semitism, you 
know, they™re running into open doors. He 
admitted it publicly again and again. 
Q: Yes, there is this --  there ar e people who will say -- 
A: I know. 

Q: -- at a certain point he was anti-Semitic
, but then they don™t speak about ho -- ho -- 
A: Right, it™s easy to say, yeah. And 
never stopped asking God™s forgiveness. 
Q: Did -- did it cause a conflict in him about hi
s religious beliefs because anti-Semitism was so 
strong within -- 

A: No, it could -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- the ji -- the Chris
tian church he felt could 
do very well without -- 
Q: Without it. 
A: -- anti-Semitism.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Anti-Semitism of the church is a contradi ction in itself, he said. 

Q: Mm-hm. In spite of itself. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. How did he feel a
bout the state of Israel, do 
you remember?  Early, when -- 
A: I really don™t know, he went to
 Israel only once when I was -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- when I was there. He was what -- I heard 
from conversations with the ambassadors, and so 
I know that he was very pleased. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
137 
 
 
Q: But I would imagine that the politics also 
was conflicting in some  ways. Or not?  You don™t 
know?  
A: Really, quite frankly, I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: I really don™t know. 

Q: What other theologians, when 
you were ma rried to him, were quo -- 
A: We ll, he never considered hims elf a theologian. 

Q: -- logian, okay. 

A: You know? 

Q: Other people of the religious -- 

A: Yeah. I know. 

Q: You know what I me an. Abraham Heschel, or 
Tillich, or Niebohr. Were there people that he 

associated with or not? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: But it™s not bec --  I came too late into his life. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You know, Paul Tillich, of
 course, he knew him.  
Q: Heschel ma y not have been alive when you -- 

A: I beg your pardon? 

Q: I -- H-Heschel, I can™t re
me mber now when Heschel -- 

A: No, no. And I really don™t know, 
but considering him, he woul
d always raise his voice when 
people called him a theologian. He had, you know, 
walls of books, theology books that he never 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
138 
 
 
read, didn™t interest him.  He was 
a pastor in this world to spread 
the me ssage of Jesus. And that™s 
what he would not ever understa
nd about me  turning to Judaism. 
Q: Yes, I would -- I would 
like to ask you, you would not -- 
A: He would -- but I could not -- I -- I -- 
I wouldn™t have done a 
-- I couldn™t have done 
otherwise, you know?  Tr -- my -- my
 connection with Jesus is stil
l the same, only he was a Jew, 
he was a pious Jew. And -- but the 
-- our faith, we are di
vided by Christians faith in him, and the 
Jews, the faith of him. His faith, you know?  
So he was not, you know wh-when -- when 
Christians nowadays, so -- so-called Christians sa
y, still talking about the 
Holocaust, isn™t it time  
that we moved on, you know?  And they have all sort
s of ma rvelous [indeciphe
rable]. First of all, 
who would put closur
e?  Who i s  t h er e? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And then I always say, what would a pious Christ
ian say that if the Jews answer -- if the Jews 
accuse them of, my God, the deat
h of Jesus is 2,000 years ago, isn™t it time to put -- that was 
different because Jesus wa s the Messiah. 
Q: Right. 

A: Jesus was the son of God. Son of God?  No Je
ws contradicts, because we are all the children 
of God, created by Him in His image. 

Q: But let me  ask you some thing, when you ma rry
 -- I can™t call him Martin, actually, I -- 
A: Of course you can. 

Q: -- okay, all right, Pastor Martin Nie -- Niemoelle
r. Martin Niemoeller, you™re going to church 
every Sunday? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
139 
 
 
Q: Yes?  So what does this do t -- I mean, do you ta
lk about faith?  When he speaks of -- is he 
giving sermons at this point? 
A: He was giving a sermon almost every Sunday. I -- 

Q: Okay, and you™re listening? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: I listen to his sermons while 
they™re being ma de, of course. 
Q: Right. 

A: He calls me  up every half hour to change a word or so. And -- 

Q: So, are you looking at this as an esthetic 
experience as opposed to a religious experience? 
A: As a humanistic experience. 

Q: And so -- 

A: Not as a -- 
Q: Not as a religious one. 
A: No. And -- 

Q: And does he understand th
is, or is he not sure? 
A: He is not sure and he -- I ha
d a feeling he didn™t really want 
to know. Might not have liked the 
answers. But I could not, being ma rried to him coul
d not -- of course, I co
uld never -- I mean, the 
Halacha forbids it, I coul d never -- not the Halacha 
in this case, the --  the -- the German law for -
- forbids -- the theologian law, that a 
priest is ma rried to a Jewish spouse. 
Q: Really? 

A: Only after ist -- righ
tfully so, rightfully so. They should be
 not a Catholic either, they should 
be of the same  faith. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
140 
 
 
Q: Of the same faith? 
A: Yes. But he was already retired, but I wouldn™
t have done it to hi m because it would have hurt 
him. But after he was gone, I didn™
t think twice. I went -- the next 
week I went to the f -- to the 
place where I could lean -- 
learn j -- learn Hebrew. 
Q: So this was brewing in you for a long time? 

A: It was brewing in me  for a long time . 

Q: So ex -- you do explain it in your book in some  way -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: That th-the -- it™s as if -- I 
don™t know, it™s -- it™s as if -- 

A: The Christian view of God 
di -- didn™t go well with me .  
Q: It just didn™t. 

A: No, it just didn™t. 

Q: Which means -- 
A: -- and you cou -- 
Q: -- the crucified Christ, is that the image that
 you -- is -- that you throw 
out, or is it some other 
[indecipherable] 

A: No, not that -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- necessarily. It was 
either God is almi ghty. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then He would have spared His 
son the death of th
e -- on the cross.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
141 
 
 
A: Or the Holocaust. Or He is not. What am I 
doing with a God who™s not almi ghty?  And then 
the Christian way of life is geared to the hereaf
ter. That™s how the Catholic church especially, 
gets their people. If you suffer here, it m
eans that you™ll have a 
glorious whatever. 
Q: But that™s not the Protestant view? 
A: That is -- oh well, mo re or less, yes. The he
reafter is very, very important. While we Jews, we 
live for this life. And wh
at -- not what we think, but what we do is important. And that went very 
well with me. 

Q: Mm-hm. How do you -- 

A: The Mitzvot, you know? 

Q: Right. But how do you deal with the notion of 
an all powerful God as -- if you™re a Jewish 
person who believes in God -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. At this point I™m not really sure. 

Q: Aha. That™s not the issue. 
A: No, it™s -- it™s no issue for 
me . But I know there is -- they 
-- as far as I™m concerned -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- as I said, I™m being led by a higher power 
all the way, so He must have some thing in mi nd. 

Not she, but He. 

Q: And not a she-he. Only a he. 

A: That™s -- that™s not -- 
it doesn™t really ma tter. I 
belong to a conservative -- 
Q: We ll then it must be a he, I guess, right? 

A: No, we pray for -- for Rivka
 and for Leah and all that. 

Q: Really. Yeah. 

A: Yes. They are quite -- quite Reform, ma ny wa ys.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
142 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I was converted in a Ref-for m movement. 

Q: In Reform? 

A: Oh yes -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- at the progressive, as they 
call it. Liberal, as th
ey call it in England. Bu
t I had to, in -- in 
order to be converted in England as 
a liberal, I had to go to the Mikvah. 
Q: Right. 

A: Which I did in New York. Which I loved by the way. 

Q: It was nice? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It is, you know, sa -- it™s so meaningful. 
Q: We  have to change the tape. 
A: We  have to change? 

Q: Yeah.

Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: What was your mother™s response 
to your getting ma
rried to Martin? 
A: She did not take it very well.
 First of all she sai
d, ﬁHe™s mu ch too old for you.ﬂ And then she 
said, ﬁHe™s much too old for you.ﬂ And then she cam
e out with the truth, th
at years before -- and 
I even knew that, she had me ntioned it at the time,
 when Elsa was forlorn and -- and -- and -- and 
always when she was very depressed about he
r husband™s absence when he was in the camp, 
Dorha, the housekeeper, the one who was called -- wa
s killed with her in th
at car crash; Elsa and 
Dorha were killed together. Dorha would cal
l my  mother and said, ﬁWould you please come 
over?  Frau Niemoeller is so depressed, she wants 
to see you.ﬂ So my mot h
er raced over there, 
sitting at her bedside, or what
ever it was, and then, you know, af
ter she complained, she did her 
bit of compl a ining, she said, ﬁYou know, if your 
husband,ﬂ my father, ﬁsomehow gets killed 
during the you know, one way or the other, and I 
die, and my husband is still alive and you are 
still alive, you™ve got to ma
rry hi m. I am not strong enough to be ma rried to him.ﬂ And my 
mother to -- obviously took that 
very seriously. But then we were
 being as graceful, as gracious 
as she was, she arranged herself with the given 
situation, and they became very close and dear 
friends. 

Q: They did? 

A: Yes. It was almost touching to see 
those two, so close in age, together. 
Q: Right. 

A: She was born in August, and they were se
parated by -- by four m
onths, Martin was like 
Albert Schweitzer, born on the 14
th
 of January. 
Q: And were you living close by, sh -- wa
s she -- she was 
living in Berlin? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

A: She was living in Berlin. And h-had a ma ssi
ve stroke at age -- well, she was 80, she was 
about my age, and -- which robbed her of her spe
ech and use of her right 
arm and right leg, and I 
was called to Berlin, some body else took care of 
-- of my husband in Wi esbaden. I drove to 
Berlin, and the doctor took me aside and said, ﬁF
rau Niemoeller, have no illusi ons, this clock has 
run out.ﬂ And I said, ﬁDoktor, you don™t know my
 mother,ﬂ you know?  And 
my mother lived for 
more than 12 years, regained her speech, use of 
her right arm,  she could wa
lk with a little limp. 
Q: You™re kidding. 
A: But she was there and all with it. So you se 
-- it™s very dangerous for a medical man to make 
prognosis of a person -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- he doesn™t know, and my mo
ther was a bundle of energy. 
Q: Did you become  closer to your 
mother as -- as you got older? 

A: Yes, for the reason that she go
t older and more helpless, of course. But there is not a day that 
goes by that I don™t -- the I re -- 
really regret for not having had 
a relationship with my -- with 
my mother. But my brother didn™t ha
ve one either, in the end, you know. 
Q: Neither one of you did. 

A: No, no. She just -- but I realiz
ed it long before my -- my br othe
r did, I think, that she was not 
to blame, that was the way she was made, that sh
e had been educated. She lived in fear of me n, 
and to -- she was not allowed, and sh
e couldn™t partake in discussions.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: She hadn™t been brought up in -- you know, and 
Elsa was -- no, she -- Elsa was a -- a teacher 
of English, so she knew more. But in our circles a 
woman was raised as a gi
rl to be ma rried off. 
Married off. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

Q: [indecipherable] off. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And be -- and be off. 

A: And become  --  

Q: So how did Martin and your mother have a frie
ndship if she was so -- I me an, what -- what -- 
what did you see? 

A: On -- oh, she was mu ch ten -- mo re tender 
to him than she ever was with us, you know. 
Q: Really? 

A: Her son-in-law, and she t-talks of very amus
ing stories, like visiti
ng the cemetery of Saint 
Anne™s, where she was buried by the way, a
nd s -- seated, resting on a bench, she was 
approached by two ladies, and the ladies say I 
wonder -- to my mother, ﬁI wonder if you can t-
tell me , we™re here as visitors and we are looking for Martin Ni emoeller™s grave.ﬂ And my 

mother rose to her full height of -- she was muc h ta
ller than I, and said, ﬁH
e is not dead. I talked 
to him 15 minutes ago, he™s my son-in-law.ﬂ They 
left in a panic, I think they must have thought 
she was -- 

Q: Crazy. 

A: -- bananas, yeah, yeah. No, she was very
 proud of being his mother-in-law, you know. 
Q: Right. How would you explain 
to him your becomi ng Jewish? 
A: I couldn™t. 

Q: You couldn™t. 

A: And I never even imagined it. I only know he
 would have been hurt th
at I left the Messiah. 
Jesus was his reason for surviving, you know?  And it 
started early, when he was 14, he had a -- a 
happening that when his father, who was a -- I 
reme mber my own -- my own father-in-law and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
146 
 
 
my mother-in-law, I met them when I was very 
little. And his father very much believed in 
some thing that past ors, or some time s even rabbis don™t do any more, visiting me mbers of the 
congregation and getting to know 
them. And his fa -- and whi -- pa
stor -- old Pastor He inrich 
Niemoeller was exempl ary. Every afternoon he™dgo and see some body. And he visited th -- the 

home  of a miner. This was where he -- this wa
s a mi ning district where they lived. And on the 
wall -- and the mi ner is -- is eaten up by some  dr
e a dful lung disease and on
 the wall Martin sees 
some  words under glass in German, ﬁ Waswürde Je
sus sagen?ﬂ What would Jesus say? So this 
word guided him through all his life
. Whatever he did, he would as
k first, what would Jesus say 
to that?  And how I could mi ss out on it because he
 would -- he would suspect a terrible void in 

me , what wasn™t there,
 you know?  I don™t know how. 
Q: So you don™t think he would even understand it? 

A: No. It was -- would have been beyond him.  

Q: But I just couldn™t have done otherwise. Wh
en people ask me, and I™ m often asked, now tell 
us the motivation why you became Jewish. I 
said, ﬁVery easy, I had to.ﬂ I had to. 
Q: But then people say, so 
what™s behind the having to? 
A: There is no [indecipherable] firs
t of all, I do not -- I follow my 
me ntors, Albert Friedlander™s, 
and London™s advice not to ever ge t in argument 
with Christians about it because I would soon 

notice that I was being maneuvered into a corner
 where I have to defend myself. So when I™m 

asked in a -- in a -- by the -- a 
me mb er of the audie -- now tell 
us about the -- I said, ﬁI don™t 
discuss that in public.ﬂ But I will in a s-smaller 
and preferably Jewish circle. But the funny thing 
is that Martin™s successor in o
ffice, Doktor Spengler, Jewish pr
esident of the Church of Hessen 
and Nassau, I didn™t have to explain anything to
 him about the co-convers
ion. He called me  one 
day, and he said, ﬁI™ve heard you 
converted to Judaism.ﬂ He  sa
id, ﬁI think it™s ma rvelous.ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490

Q: Is there -- I don™t -- I don™t ev
en know if you can answer this 
question, but is there some  way 
in which you™ve come -- I -- I don™t want to say b
ack to your roots, cause I™m not sure what that 
means. You -- one™s roots are ma ny different thin
gs, and you weren™t particularly religious as a 
child, in spite of th -- 
A: I was god-fearing. The fear of 
God was God sees everything, you know? 
Q: God -- everything. I see. 

A: But otherwise -- 

Q: A-Assuming that 
you lost that -- 
A: -- not with a great love for God, yeah. 

Q: Otherwise, you had no great l
ove for God. But  there is, in 
some  way you grew up under the 
clouds of National Soci
alism all your life. 
A: Heavy clouds. 

Q: From the  ni -- from the day that you™re born -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- they™re not in power
, but they™re there.  
A: Yes. 

Q: So there™s -- and a central f
eature of the -- who they are, is
 ridding the world of the Jews.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: And that is in some  sense very important 
within the context of your family of trying to 
negotiate and help and to figure this -- it™s not un
important in your fa mily. So there -- I -- it™s not 
payba -- I don™t -- I don™t exactly 
know what the words are, but it™s
 almo st as if you™re trying to 
reverse part of that history -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0490  
148 
 
 
Q: -- and ma ke yourself whole by being part of
 what was being destr 
-- destroyed. I don™t know 
if that™s right. 
A: Yes, that is part  of it, I am sure, I am 
sure. Because what was destroye d by Hitler, who was 
almost -- I mean he -- he almost managed to -- to
 get rid of all the Jews in Europe, must have 
been so powerful that he felt it a
nd he feared it. And that™s why I 
had to find out what that is, you 
know?  Power has always attracted me, and Judaism 
is a very powerful religion. But not alien to 
me, but it™s now part of me. 

Q: Right. And do you consider yourself religious now? 

A: Yeah. Always -- ever since I became  Jewis
h, I consider myself religious. I go not only 
because I -- I read the -- the To
rah regularly and -- and the pr ayer book. I pr ay the Sh™ema  three 
times a day, and I don™t keep kosher, but I believe G
od is mo -- has become  mo
re -- what is the -- 
now I can™t -- 

Q: Tangible? 
A: Tangible for me . More real for me . He is not the old ma n with a white beard any more, but 
some thing I truly cannot define.  

Q: Well, I have to th
ank you so very much -- 
A: Well -- 

Q: -- for spending the day with us. 

A: Well, it was my pleasure. I™m so proud and 
so happy to be Jewish, you know, that is my 
favorite subject anyway. 

Q: It is, yes? 

A: Oh yes, mm-hm. 

Q: We ll, thank you again for comi ng [indecipherable]

mother, and that™s my 
grandmother. 
Q: Do you know how -- when this photo was taken? 
A: I can guess, of course. How 
old does my mother look?  14? 

Q: Something like that. 

A: Yeah, then it was taken in 1900 and I woul
d say -- does it say anything on the back, or 
nothing? 

Q: Don™t think so. 

A: I would guess 1905 or ™06. 

Q: Okay. 

A: That is the castle of Rimburg that is on the border between Germany and -- and the 

Netherlands. And the first stone was laid around 
Charlema gne, in the year 800. And it has any

Siegfried™s oldest son

A: My father was -- as of -- an attaché, as an 
adjutant, going w
ith his boss. And in those days 
they didn™t -- the German head of state did not 
travel by an extra train. His salon car was attached 
to the regular train to Petersburg. That was the 
Prussian way of doing things, not wasting money.
