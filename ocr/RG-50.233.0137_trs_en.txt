Interview with JackTr ompettor 
April 2, 1992 
Ca mbridge, Massachusetts 
 
Q: The date isApril 2, 1992. We ™re speaking w
ith JackTr ompettor Cambridge, Massachusetts.  
Mr.Tr ompettor, could you please tell me  you na me 
at the time of the war, 
your date of birth and 
your place of birth and anything you possibl
y can about your fa mily background and you 

childhood? 
 

A: Well my Hebrew name is Isaac,Yi tzhak.  I was gi ven the name Jack at the time because it was 
not safe, I suppose, to call children Isaac.  I wa
s born inAmsterdam.  I was born in a hospital 
which, at the time, was taken over by the Germans and used for theirWe hrma cht wounded.  So 

there was my mother lying there and having me a
nd because the family name inTr ompettor, not 
Cohen or Nathanson, it wasn™t  evident 
giveaway that it was a Jewish name. 
 

Q: The date, when was this? 

 

A: This wasAugust 2, 1942. When 
my mother gave birth to me it 
was also the same  time that my 
father had been arrested.  He was arrested in 
what™s called a razia which was a raid which was 
what the Germans at that point would do in 1942. They would come  into a Jewish 

neighborhood, seal off the streets, and then just 
pick up all the me n that they could find and in 
this case my  father was caught and he was taken 
to Oester Park, East Park which is a park in 

Amsterdam where they held them. And then they
 transpor ted them, to the Uterperstaad which 
was where the Gestapo had their central headqu
arters and it was a school
 that they took over 
and they had some  kind of, I think, gymnasiu
m building, or some gymnasium- like building 

where they had all the men lie down, belly, face
 down and they beat the me n on the backs and 
on the legs. We , of course found all this out afte
rwards.  My father was 
arrested.  My mother 
did not know where he was.  She gives birth to 
me .  She is understandably terribly, terribly 
anxious and afraid. There was a curfew at this
 time  and no J e ws are allowed on the streets at 
certain hours which made it all very difficult to
 do shopping and even visiting some one at the 
hospital.  But it turned out that  my mother ™s fath
er, he was a ma n in his late sixties who wasn™t  
afraid and really didn™t, I suppose, care about th
is curfew.  He was going to see his daughter and 
grandson. 
 

Q: Did he wear a yellow star on his coat? 

 

A: You know, I don™t know; it™s a good question.  He cam
e to visit my mother every day during the 
period when my father was -- his whereabouts we
re unknown.  My mother got ill after she gave 
birth to me . I guess anxiety and ev
erything.  She was beside hersel
f.  Finally, and I don™t  know 
within how ma ny days this transpires, I think ma ybe
 three or four or five
, my father is let go.  
He calls up his work place. They send a car
t which was what you had in Holland then which 
was to transport goods. You had a bicycle with so
rt of a cart in front and they put him in the 
cart and they took him home. The reason they 
did that was because he could barely walk 
because he was beaten on his legs.  It™s an in
teresting st ory how he actually got out. And how 
he got out wa s, as he told it, all the captives 
were lined up. And they had the Gestapo, they had 
the green police, they had the 
Dutch police, those Dutch police 
who were collaborators. They 
had all levels of police.  Everyone wanted to be
 a brute of some  kind.  Everyone wanted to get 

in, in some way. The Germans were very, very
 concerned withTB. They were very, very 
concerned with that, I guess, what™s the word I™m
 looking for, plagues or 
some  kind of -- what™s 
the word I™m looking for -- not a plague.   
 
Q: Contagion. 

 

A: Some  contagious disease, thank you. And they
 had a doctor who was a Jewish doctor look at all 
the me n and ask the me n, the captives, questions.  Based on these questions the me n were let 

go. And to be let go meant to be kicked in behi
nd and told to get the hell out and never come  
back or whatever. The Germans were so afraid 
of contagious diseases that their solution to 
contagious disease was to throw people out.  
This doctor was some one my father had known.  
In the twenties my father had some  kind of a 
lung problem and it wasn™t TB.  But at the time 
you carried with you some  kind of 
i dentity card I think that you w
ith if you had some kind of a 
me dical eme rgency you could whip it out.  So he
 had a card with him and some how he had the 
good sense to have the card out or show it to 
the doctor and the doctor 
and German officers are 
standing at this point in front 
of my father and the tension is
 throughout all this very, very 
intense and very high and a lot of
 questions are being asked and cr
isscrossed. At the same time 
the German asks the doctor if this man hasTB b
ecause of the card.  He ends up saying yes.  But 
if turns out he™s  saying yes to another offi
cer ™s demand who is saying, mach shnell, mach 
shnell, hurry up, hurry up, hu
rry up. The level of tension was purposely created by the 
Germans. This is what they did to disempower
 people, to terrorize them
. And it was a tactic; it 
was a strategy.  It wasn™t  simply people losing 
their temper.  It was 
a strategy of terrifying 
people.  So they™re asking what™s  going on, mach 
shnell, yes.  It seems to be mi sunderstood by 
the head officer that my father indeed hadTB
.  So they grabbed him, they boot him in his 
behind, they throw him out, lucky him.  He gets 
to a phone, calls up his work place. They send 
over the bicycle and the cart.  He come s home  to
 discover he™s had a son.  I don™t think he was 
able to visit my mother or myself in the hospi
tal.  My mother come s home .  Everybody is very 
happy to have me .  I wa s name d Isaac,Yi tzhak, he who laughs. The first time I asked my 
parents, when talking with them about the war ex
periences why they would want to have a child 
during this time, why they had me . They said it 
wa s their blow against Hitler. And I have very 
mi xed feelings about this.  It makes me a little 
choked up as it does right now because I feel in 
some  way it casts me  in some  kind of historical
 responsibility and there are times where I would 

say I wish that they didn™t have me  then on one
 hand.  On the other hand I™m always grateful 
that they provided themselves to bring me into 
the world. That™s the bottom line.  So I am the 
blow against Hitler. 
 

Q: That is a responsibility.  Ca
n you back up a little and tell me  about your family history. Are 
they long time  Dutch Jews or ha
d they come  from Ger many or ––. 
 

A: Ye s, my fa mily name Tr ompettor. There is 
some  dispute whether we are Se phardic which is 
Tr ompaita or whether we areAshkenazim from the 
East.  I don™t know.  I tend to think we were 
Sephardim. The reason for that, actually, is a 
number of years agoTi me  Magazine, the New 
YorkTi me s Sunday ma gazine had an article on Sp
ain.  On the cover they
 had a picture of a 
young boy who trained horses and it 
looks just like me , like I did when I was young.  So there™s 
a cast to my face that would give that some
 authenticity.  So I think we were Sephardim 
although we did not speak Latino in our fa mily nor
 did we speak Hebrew in our family.  My 
parents were working class people.  My mother
 had three brothers.  My father had three 
brothers and three sisters. 
 

Q They all were fromAmst erdam? 
 

A: Ye s, we wereAmsterdam working class 
people. Amsterdam by the Dutch was known as 
Mokum, M- O-K-U-M, which was a, I don™t know how but it was aYi ddish word for 

Amsterdam and it got into the lexi con. The Dutc
h refer toAmsterda m often as Mokum.  Not 
just the Jews use that term. And the Jews in
 Holland, I think I™d sa
y you know who c a me  from 
the East and came from Spain and Holland was ve
ry hospitable to them.  My parents family, 
ma ny of them worked in the diamond cutting 
and polishing industry which was the ma in 

industry for the Jews as well as textiles. 
You had different Jewish neighborhoods in 
Amsterdam.  There was one neighborhood calle
d the gold coast which wa s where the more 
well-to-do Jewish people would live. Then ther
e was what was theYodebrastaat which is the 
wide Jewish street which is, I 
think, also the street where Remb
randt had his tourist home  right 
now.  It was a large Jewish community.  It™s th
e southeast ofAmsterdam.
  It™s where ma ny of 
the Dutch Jews lived.  
 

Q: Do you know where their families lived, your parents™ families? 

 

A: No, I know. Ye s my parents™ family lived in
 the neighborhood of theYodebrastaat. We  lived 
right after the war in theTunsvalstraat right on 
theTunsvalkad which was a canal asAmsterdam 
is crisscrossed by canals.  Is there anyt
hing else I could say 
about my parents?   
 

Q: Do you know anything about Jewishly like we
re they religious, were they observant? 
 

A: Ye s, my parents both went to Hebrew school 
when they were younger. We  were not a kosher 
home . You must understand that the Dutch Jews
 were mostly working class people and while 
my parents and their families se
t a table every Friday night th
ere were no prayers said and I 
don™t think there were blessings sa
id over the bread or wine with
 the meal but all the children 
would be there for that dinner and some  with th
eir sweetie pi es and afte
r dinner they would all 
leave for their Friday night gallivanting, you know young people. There™s not much talk in my 

fa mily of poverty or anything like that even dur
ing the depression. Ther
e were hard time s.  
There was always food.  My father worked in the 
food trades, in the restau
rant trade and always 
had food, brought home food.  So there was always th
at. And also he was one of the brothers 
who always seemed to have worked during the ha rd years.  My grandmothers did not work.  

They were grandmothers which was a job in its
elf.  My mother and father knew each other 
when they were in their late teens. And as 
my mother tells it, she had a crush on my father 
because he was so quiet and sweet and I guess, po
lite. They met each other through my father ™s 
sister Maricha, Marie who perished and had be
come  sweethearts very early on and had been 
very fond of each other and close to
 each other.  It was, I guess, 
in those days that you paired up 
real early.  But they were engaged for a long ti
me. They didn™t married until they were thirty 
and the reason for that is that they wanted to
 save money for furniture. And now my mother 
talks about how she regrets in li
ght of course not knowing about
 the war that they didn™t get 
ma rried sooner and have babies sooner. And I 
always kind of wondered why they didn™t have 
more babies and in some  ways
 regret not having children. 
 

Q: Do you know your parents™ dates of birth? 

 

A: Ye s, of course. You know at a certain age 
if you don™t send them a birthday card you have hell 
to pay.  My father was born in 1911, May 25
th
.  My mother was born in 1910, June 14
th
.  So 
we™re all summer babies. 

 
Q: So that was the situation leading up to the wa
r.  Ha your mot her been working, did she have a 
career? 
 

A: Ye s, she was a seamstress.  She talks about ha
ving loved her career as a seamstress.  In her 
ma nuscript which she spent seven years writing sh
e talks about the shop 
she was in.  She talks 
about the labor struggles.  Duri
ng this time there were ma ny, ma ny labor struggles.  My parents 
were as ma ny Dutch Jews were working class pe
ople and by and large they voted for the Social 
De mocratic Party which here we 
would mi stakenly call Socialist or Le ft. They were a liberal 
democratic party whose interests represented worki
ng class people. And they also took part of 
the culture of the Social De mocr
atic Parties and on the first of
 May, you™d have picnics, you™d 
have festivals. You would often have camping tr
ips that these parties of the Left provided for 
young people which my parents often went to.  
And your question before about a religious 
household, I do not recall ever having heard 
my parents talk about
 a religious household 
although there are some  times now when I talk to 
my mother and she disputes that. And I think 
she may dispute it because there is some matte
r of pride but I don™t think, and she would know 
better than I what happened in t
hose years, but I never heard talk
 about her religious upbringing.  
I know we never had a kosher home. The first ti
me  I stepped into a shul was when I was Bar 
Mitzvahed. 
 

Q: Really?   So you didn™t go for the 
High Holidays or anything like that? 
 

A: Before we were Bar Mitzvahed my pa rents plead
ed with my brother and I to go to shul for the 
High Holidays and we didn™t. And we compromi se
d. We said well we™ll get dressed and we™ll 
walk around temple so everyone will see us but
 we™re not going in because we didn™t know 
Hebrew and also being refugees and being survivor
s we felt in a way alienated fr om the Jewish  
community about us. And that is some thing that 
is very typical of people with our story.  In 
some way we were met with a lo
t of not understanding.  I always ha
ve felt very alienated from 
Judaism.  I knew when I grew up in Brooklyn ther
e were times where I would be beaten up for 
being Jewish.   Easter would roll around and th
e Italian kids, boys, would come  fromAvenue X 
and we lived onAvenue Z andAvenueY was 
a dividing line and you had the Italian people 
living onAvenue X and the Jewish people living 
onAvenue Z. And as what was popularly 

known then Jewish boys did not fight. They did 
not fight.  So Easter would come  around and I 
with my friends would be playing outside a
nd Italian boys would come  into the neighborhood 
and they would tell us we  killed Christ. A
nd I didn™t know who this boy Christ was, I had no 
idea. And I certainly knew that I and no one had 
killed anybody recently.  So they would attack 
us and beat us up. We  didn™t know about fightin
g back.  So that happened a few time s . And I 
guess that was one of ma ny punctuation ma rks in my
 feeling not Jewish. And for ma ny years I 
did not in some  way come out as
 being Jewish.  I did not come forward with it.  I did not 

cultivate my social relationships based on people 
being Jewish.  I had friends from all kinds of 
groups as I do now. 
 

Q: But meanwhile though your parents had settled in a basically Jewish area? 

 

A: We ll, yes, yes. We  ca me toAmerica in 1949, my
 parents, my brother, who was really my step-
brother as I™ll go on to tell later, my a unt and 
uncle and their two daughters. We  lived in Far 

Rockaway.  First few mo nths we ha
d an attic and we all slept on cots
 in the attic. And then at 
some  point we got an apartment in Rockaway. We  got two baseme nt apartments which were 

about three blocks from the ocean which us kids 
in the family absolutely loved because it meant 

our summer s we had a lot to do and to play.  But in the spring when the rains came the 
baseme nt would always be flooded 
and we™d always have to buy a new rug.  So it was a sort of 
immi grant story. And then in 1951 when Beachha
ven which was one of the first proj ects that 
FredTr ump built (which is the D
onald™s father) built in Brooklyn, my parents moved out there.  
It was a very big step.  It really
 was an attempt for my parents to 
start to build some thing for us.  
At one point they talked about wanting to move
 to Long Island which was also considered a 
step up and buy a home there which they never did. 
 I as of late come  to understand that there 
was a subtext to our life which was around the ma tte
r of denial and that had to do with getting 
on with life and putting all that stuf
f behind us, just get on with life. 
 

Q: I hate to stop you but could 
you tell me  what happened to your fa mily during the war?  We  
started with your birth so there 
are two more years at least. 
 

A: There™s plenty.  So I was born onAugust second.
 This was the time when people were already 
being deported toVe staburg which was a transit 
camp in the north of Holland, in the moors, 
God forsaken nowhere place.  FromVe staburg ev
eryTuesday the transport went east.  People 
went either toAuschwitz, toTr eblinka, to Sobi
bor, to Chelmo where most of my grandparents, 
aunts and uncles perished.  Because our name  wa
sTr ompettor and as I said not like Cohen or a 
lot of typical Dutch Jewish name s my father
 who belonged to a butcher ™s  union which was 

taken over by the Dutch Fascists, the Jewish na
mes would all be crossed off. Tr ompettor was 
not crossed off which meant we w
ould continue to get thei r news letter but this time with the 
National Socialist ma sthead on it. 
 So my father would conspic
uously leave it on a little side 
table by the door in case there we
re raids and people would come
 in they would see this and 
think my fat her was not Jewish. 
 Upstairs though in the same  house 
lived my mother ™s parents.  
During this time  the Jewish Council inAmsterdam 
as there we re in ma ny countries had a list of 
all the people who were in Holland who were Je
wish and the list was made available to the 
Germans. And I know there is much argument a
bout the role of the Jewish Council.  Because 
my parents were, I guess, working class people 
and sympathetic to the left of the political 
spectrum they had a certain kind of savvy about
 what was happening.  
In Holland from ™33 on 
you had over 25,000 German Jewish refugees so 
stories got around. People got a sense of the 
brutality that  was there. When my father was ar
re sted and beaten up as he  tells it, he was of 
course among other things shocked. 
 Some thing like this never ha
ppened to him and he felt that 
with this kind of brutality it was going to 
get worse and nothing would stop the Germans and 
that if they were capable of this
 no one was safe. And that™s  what
 he felt.  Before that happened 
there was the curfew, there were people being ta
ken away, there were st
reet fights in Jewish 
neighborhoods.  Dutch fascists would come  
into the Jewish neighborhoods, the ice-cream 
parlors, the tea houses an
d start fights and there would be these altercations.  But when he was 
beaten up he understood how bad it was and he 
decided then he was going to go underground.  
He was not going to register.  My mother ™s  brot
her, Shok who is the name  I was given, Jack, in 
honor of him, I think he was a very
 active Socialist and as my moth
er tells the story right before 
or after I was born she™s in my parents™ home and 
my mother ™s brother Shok is still living there 
she enters into his room and sees him with 
a tallis and he™s  praying. And she is shocked 
because she™s known him as a what should we call it an agnostic, an athe ist.  My mother says 

what™s  going on? And he says, well he™s  prayin
g so his parents won™t be taken away and has 
decided that he will go and regist
er in their place. Throughout 
the early period of the German 
occupations and the subjugation of the Jewish co
mmunity there were continual regulations that 
were tended to deceive people.  One of them wa
s  that if the young people in the family would 
register, the old people would not
 be taken. This was of course a way of sabotaging and 
undermining any for m of resistance and ma
ny, many people believed it. You have to 

understand and appreciate that. What some  peopl
e mi ght see as stupidity or cooperation isn™t 
quite that.  It has to be understood in the c
ontext of Holland is a count
ry that™s  very mu ch 
concerned with law, with rules, with order.   
I alwa ys feel that they
™re kind of caught between 
the anvil of Calvinism and the hammer ofAnar
chism and the reason for that is because cities 
likeAmsterdam and Rot t erdam are international 
cities and the Dutch have been for a few 
hundred years an international me rcha
nt people.  So not to register
 was considered an illegal act 
even though it was clear to ma ny that those who we
re in power, who ma de the law, were evil.  
But my father decided he was not going to regi
ster, he was going to do some thing else. That 
was a very big step.  It wa s the first step to re
sistance.  Many people of 
course had no idea what 
was going on in the east after the transports.  
People really believed they were going to be 
settled in some farm some where 
to dig potatoes and till the soil. 
 But because my father had a 
certain political savvy he knew what German Fas c
ism meant as people did.  So he decided he 
was not going to register; he was going to 
go underground. The problem was what does that 
mean?   How do you do it?  Who do you ma ke contact
 with?  Who do you trust? And it was all 
luck.  So my  mother ™s  brother Shok decides he™s  go
ing to register to save
 the grandparents.  He 
registers.  He  is sent toVe staborg. At some  
point fromVestaborg he sends my mother a card, 
my mother and father a card that says don™t br
ing the red baby wagon which was their code for 
saying do not come , do not bring Jackie as I was known because even inVe staborg which was 

not as horribl e as the camps in the east there wa
s constructed to deceive people. Actually when 
I say this I am stunned at how rema rkable the deception was, to be deceived.  In some  way I 

know this is in hindsight I get 
very angry at it.  How could pe
ople be so stupid?  And on the 
other hand how can I say that?  And all of it is
 a, it™s a mi x of feelings one has, I have. 
 

Q: I think you pointed it out when you said how th
e Dutch people were concerned with order and 
all that and they say they came in so fast to 
Holland and people were in shock and they just 
rounded up and took them out.  I don™t think they
 had time to really think. That was my 
impression. 
 

A: Yeah, but you know they had people comi ng 
in fr om Ger many from 1933 with stories. 

 

Q: Tr ue.Tr ue. 

 

A: Hitler and Hitler did not have a reputation ot he
r than terrorism, cajoling, bullyism.  He™s the 
ultimate form of European bullyism.   So my 
father comes home; I am born. They decide 
they™re going to go underground. And one of the terr
ible things that also
 happens is that one 
considers the older people, the grandparents.  
Wh at do they do?   How do they go underground?   
And the fa mily is kind of in some  wa y the younger
 people start to provide for themselves. This 
is a question my cousins and I have often wonde
red about. What aboutthe grandparents; what 

do you do?  And I understand it™s  a terrible questi
on and it™s one I have asked my mother and 

never really gotten any kind of a satisfactory answ
er and I™m a little bit ashame d to even pursue 
it.  But I wonder about it.  I can tell you one story,
 terrible story.  My father has the newspaper 
with the National Soci alist ma sthead left  at the 
table. There is a raid one day. The Dutch 
police, the green police which were the German
 police come  in. They know the people who 
live upstairs are Jewish. They come  t o take them 
away.  It turns out to be my mother ™s parents 
and it is my mother ™s mo ther ™s, my grandmother ™
s birthday that this ha
ppens. And my mother 
of course is beside herself in
 shock, terrible, terrible. You 
can imagine how terribl e so mething 
like that is.  My father gather
s his wits; he goes to the police.  He says, we™ve known our 
neighbors for a long time could we please say goo
dbye to them?  The Germans say ye s.  So 
here are my parents saying goodbye.  My father is saying goodbye to his in-laws, my mother is 

saying goodbye to her parents as if they were just
 neighbors.  It™s  a terr
ible thing and I often 
wonder what my mother has done with that pain a
nd that grief.  She has written it all down.  So 
my mother ™s parents are taken away.   I don™t kno
w whether at this point before or after my 
father ™s  parents are taken away.  Some of the br
others and sisters have been taken away, some  
have not. Those that rema in decide to go unde
rground and it means you don™t tell anyone else 
where you™re going because it™s  unsafe. All 
you could do is tell your parents goodbye. When 
people went underground at the time they had 
no idea for how long this would be.  No one 
knew.  Some people thought week
s, months.  No one thought of 
years.  My parents had saved 
some  money so they had money that they knew th
ey would need to provide for their keep while 
they were underground. They ma de a conn
ection through some one they knew who knew 
some one who knew someone to two people whos
e name s are Cory and JanVa n Nomb erg who 
are people who I now know as my aunt and uncle
 who live inTilburg who we have been very 
close to since the war; people who I™m very, very
 fond of.  He was in the Dutch cavalry.  He 
was a sort of, I wouldn™t say monarchist, but he
 was a very good Dutch patriot. They came 
fromTilburg, a Catholic fa mily.  Holland is kind 
of divided like that. The people in the south 
are Catholic, the people in the north are Protesta
nt. They came from a good Catholic fa mily but 
he hated the Germans.  Not that he hated Natio
nal Socialism but he hated the Germans because 
they invaded his country.  He wanted to do someth
ing.  My parents ended up 
with them. At first 
the story was that my father was on the run; he 
didn™t want to serve in 
the army.  I don™t  know, 
what you would call a deserter.  So they were ta
ken in by Cory and Jan based on that.  But there 
is a sense that Cory and Jan did 
kind of know that that was not 
the story, that they mi ght be 
Jews. At some  point early on in their undergro
und experience it become s apparent, it™s  talked 
about and Cory and Jan decide well we™ve gone
 this far with you we™re not going to turn you 
away. And my parents spent from November 
of 1942 till the liberati
on in May with these 
people.  I we nt underground about a week, a few da
ys or a week before they went underground.  

I was three months old when I we
nt underground. You can imagine, if you can imagine what it 
was like for my mother to give up her child with 
the hope that she is saving my life with always 
the knowledge of the possibility I™m being offered 
up to destruction. We  were one of the lucky 
fa milies. We all survived.  My parent s survived.  I survived. 
 

Q: Did they circumsise you? 

 

A: I was circumcised.  It™s some thing I don™t 
understand why people woul
d take the chance of 
doing that, would take the chance because when 
there were raids the Germans would pull down 
the pants of the men in the street to see if they
 we re Jewish.  Re ma rkable, rema rkable, crude to 
say the least. Yeah, but you know I guess you circum
cise your child to show your fealty.  It™s a 
practice that I have real questions
 about.  I™m afraid that I™ve go
tten lost in some  -- I™m not in a 
track. 
 

Q: You went underground. You were sent underground. 

 

A: Ye s, I was se nt underground.  I spent the first night with my mother ™s brother ™s wife, Ollie, who 
was a gentile woma n, my mother ™s 
brother Morris, his first wife di
ed in childbirth.  He  ma rries 
Ollie.  Ollie is a gentile woma
n.  Ollie has me for one or 
two nights and my parents know 
nothing of who has me  or where I am. The deal is if the family goes underground it™s best to 

separate the children because at 
least that will raise 
the chances of some on
e surviving.  So I go 
with Ollie and eventually I™m passed on to othe
r people.  I spend a short time in a Quaker 
children™s home , a very short time .  It turns 
out that when my pare
nts are also underground 
Cory, of Cor y and Jan who are taking care of my
 parents, Cory goes to check on me  to see how 

I am. This is done without telling my mother.  
My father knows about it, Jan knows about it.  I 
don™t know why they didn™t tell my mother. They
 ma de some assumptions.  Cory goes to see 
how I am doing.  She goes to the Quaker home.  
She™s there.  She has a bad feeling about the 
place.  She takes me  out of there right away.  Sh
e spends a night with me  in the woods. They 
talk about that there was fighting or shelli
ng somewhere around ther
e but it™s 1942 so I don™t 
really understand whether there™s resistance activity 
or what but this is how it™s talked about.  
She gets me  to another place.  I am finally 
pl aced in a place called 
Hino which is about 35 
kilome ters from the German border with a very 
poor Protestant family, people who are in their 
sixties, the family De Chot.  Cory come s back which she does.  She has the good sense to go to 

a place that™s sort of like the equi
va lent of a Fotoma t.  She has a 
picture taken of me  that she can 
bring back and show my  mother.  My mother, 
in this time , doesn™t  know why Cory has been 
gone for so long.  Jan and my father know but they get worried.  She doesn™t  come  home  until 

very, very late the next day and she lays it out to
 my mother. Your boy is safe. We  ha d to take 
him out of t here. They find out subsequently it tu
rns out that the next day this place is raided -- 
that children are taken out of there. The adults
 there are arrested.  Rema rkable.  So Cory has 
this sense, has her sixth sense. 
 

Q: It™s not all Je wish children there was there or  were there ma ny? 

 

A: There were ma ny, many Jewish
 children. What they would do is they would mi x the Jewish 
children in with the -- it was like a Quaker orphan
age -- with other children. And this was often 
how it was done when Jewish children were hi
dden in groups, in France and Belgium and 

Holland. This is how it was done. When the 
children like myself went underground the parents 
were told to reme mber the clothes that th
e children had on. The pe
ople who received the 
children like myself were told 
to save  that clothing because it was the only way to identify a 
child.  So the story goes that my mot her had a ba
thing suit that they cu
t up.  Because she was a 
seamstress they made a little pant s for me, a little 
top and a little hat. This is what  I was 
deliver ed in eventually to the De Chot fa mily and 
this is what they kept..  So what we are all in 
hiding, my parents not knowing whether I™m alive or
 where I am.  My mother
 tells the story that 
every night before she went to sleep she would pr
ay for my well -being. They had cut a lock of 
hair from my head that she had and she would us
e this as some  kind of 
r e liquary, some  kind of 
talisman pray for my hair, pray for me.  Every 
night ask my fa ther when was it going to be over 
was it going to be all right. And of course wh
at could the poor ma n do but say yes my dear, of 
course.  So they were hidden with Cory and 
Jan from the end of Novemb er till May of 1945.  
For almost three years I was separated from my
 parents. When I fi
rst agreed to do this 
interview, when I was told about it my firs
t response was well you know there are so ma ny 
people who are older who have more powerful, mo
re horrible stories to tell, they™re important 
to know. And then I thought but 
who will tell the story of people 
like myself who were at this 
age if I don™t.  So it was a big step for me  to d
ecide to do it because in the community of people 
who are survivors, people who are camp su
rvivors, people who are underground survivors, 
there has been a kind of presumptuously established hierarchy of sufferi
ng, that those who were 
in the camps  suffered the most and they probabl
y did. They did indeed.  But it meant that for 
those of us who didn™t suffer like 
that we couldn™t  really tell our
 story because it was not as bad 
because we had that one potato that we shoul
d be happy for. And this has been very 
problematic.  Because of the conference last 
May this was a subject that was brought up and 
talked about. And even at theconference I had an instant where 
I was in an elevator and there 
was an older woma n standing there, a short woma
n, and she had a little identity card which we 
all had which said our name , what country we
 were from, where we were hidden and what 

years. And she™s squinting up and she is Dutc
h as I can see and I chat with her and she™s 

squinting up and looking and says
 oh you were just a baby. And I was very angry with her and I 
thought how can you be so thoughtless at
 this place.  But it is part
 of the problem.  It is the 
problem who were in camps -- although to feel 
and I can™t  be anything but sympathetic with 
that but it doesn™t allow me to tell my story.  
And I think this is an 
issue that has now been 
brought forth and dealt with as being one of the issues that we  a
ll have, that it™s  all authentic. 
 

Q: Certainly, by all means.  Did 
theAmericans liberate your parents? 
 

A: The British and Canadians.  In Holland, I was 
in the north of Holland, my  parents were in the 
south of Holland. The south of Holland was liberated
 some  time  early of ™45 and people at the 
time didn™t know what was going on in the north but
 in the north you had what was called the 
hunger winter because as the Germans were being 
defeated and withdrawi
ng they took all the 
foodstuffs they could lay their hands on and 
the consequence was that some thing like 15,000 
people in northern Holland died of hunger because 
there wasn™t  anythi ng they could put in their 
stomach, remarkable.  I lived on a farm.  Fortunate
ly there was some food available.  I™m told 
the story that the people who took care of me  
would share everything th
ey had with me  and it 
was very, very little. Wh en I was finally found I 
looked like a picture of 
what we see today of 
starving children.  I had a swelled head, tiny littl
e body, skinny bones.  But I had my share of 
what other people had. And I guess for my parents 
to have seen me eventually like this and to 
know this made it di fficult for them.  It raised 
the guilt ante for them; the guilt of having given 
me  up even though the intent was to save my life. 
There were all kinds of complex inter- family 
dynami cs come  out of this. 
 

Q: How did they ultimately find you? 

 

A: Good story.  So my parents ar
e liberated. They™re living inTilburg. Ti lburg turns out to be a 
sort of central command place for the British an
d Canadian army as well as the place where all 
the people who survived the camps come, all the 
Dutch Jews who come  back -- all, the few -- 
all, whatever twenty of them, come  back to 
Tilburg and there; ther e™s the Joint Committee of 
various Jewish organizations from
America that help in finding pe
ople, in relocating people.  It 
turns out that  my father with 
the liber ation gets a job with th
e British army as some kind of 
cook.  He does this temporarily. They ask him to
 sign up for a year, whatever.  He says forget 

it, he™s  out of it. As far as he knows he™s  the 
only ma le survivor of the family.  He™s  going to 
find out where the children are.  He knows the ch
ildren are hidden in Holland some where.  He™s  
going to find out where.  So as the story goe
s, he like Charlie Chaplin has a stick on his 
shoulder with a bag at the end of it and because 
there was not yet any r
eal public transportation 
he hitchhikes on military vehicles -- goes to this
 village -- finds out there™s a resi stance group 
there. There were a lot of church people who 
were instrume ntal in hiding children; finds this 
pastor who turns him on to a priest, who turns h
im on to a mayor.  He finally finds his way to 

know that there is a young boy who fi
ts my description who™s hidden in Hino in this farm.  He™s  
hitchhiking.  He appears there.  
It™s  night, it™s  dark, 
it™s a farmhouse.  He bangs on the door.  
People lean out the top wi
ndow, what™s  going on, who is it?  He tells the story.  My name  is 
GerritTr ompettor.  I™m looking for a young by descri
bed so and so. Wo uld he be here?  And 
there is some  pause and finally they say well yes. 
 He come s in but they don™t wake me, it™s  late 
at night.  He sleeps in a haylof
t or some where on the farm.  In the morning I am brought to him, 
I sit on his lap and I say ﬁpeen in ma  book, p
een in ma  bookﬂ which is the Dutch rural 
expression of ﬁpain in ma boukﬂ which means pain 
in my stomach.  Gerrit  thinks I am talking 
about a book. The Dutch word for stomach is ﬁbook is ﬁbookﬂ The Dutch word for stomach is 

ﬁboukﬂ.  Because I™m speaking this flat rural accen
t he doesn™t  understand me.  It turns out I™m 

talking about pain in my stomach.  I™m hungryor some thing.  I don™t know at what point he 
comprehends that he and I are speaking an entire
ly different language.  But it turns out that he 

has a talk with the family. They find out he is my father, I™m his son and he™s come  to take me .  

And I™m having trouble right now recalling whethe
r he takes me  the first day or whether he 
leaves me  there and he goes back and he gets Ce
lene, the mo m in this st or y. And it™s interesting 
that I™m having trouble recalling that.  I don™t know
. Anywa y I am reunited with my fa mily.  I 
am undernourished.  I am sickly.  I am brought 
to a doctor who informs my parents that with 
food and care in a short while I™ll be
 back to norma l, I™ll be fine. 
 

Q: You™ve absolutely no recollection 
of any of this, is that correct? 

 

A: No, I also find it very distressing that I have 
no recollection.  But I™m be
tween the ages of three 
months and two years.  Now I know there are stor
ies of people who remember some  things two, 
three years.  I have two recollect
ions.  One of them is that I am in a home , I am picked up and 
very quickly brought to a second fl
oor and I am put in a closet.  In the closet is a hobby- horse.  
And I sit on the hobby- horse for a while and I 
hear voices downstairs
 and then later I™m 
brought downstairs again.  I don™t know whether this 
is a dream or a me mory. 
That™s all I really 
reme mber. And as I said it distresses me  becau
se I really have a need to know and understand 
more about this period.  In our fa mily as it ha ppene d in ma ny families after the war when there 

were hidden parents and hidden chil
dr en the main story in the fa mily was that the parents were 
hidden and survived the war. And then there ha
ppened to be the stor y that  the children were 
hidden and survived the war.  But we were very
 young; we had no story to tell.  So our story 

kind of fell into the background. And in those year
s, right after the war and even in the fifties 
and sixties there wasn™t  any unders
tanding or talk or research or 
literature or anything on what it 
was like for children who had to be
 reunited with the parents.  
I often talk about that I was 
adopted by my parents in 1945 because here I am
 a three year old kid who talks a different 
language.  It took my parents a while, my parents 
and I to understand each other. And here I am 
thinking, I suppose, that I™ve been
 taken away from my parents by this new couple who tell me  
they™re my parents and there™s the pr ogram and I ha
ve to get with the program.  I have to love 
them as they love me  and it caused a great
 deal of problems.  It still does.   
 

Q: You think that was really 
one of the ma in tensions?   
 

A: We ll it has been, I have come  to understand it as 
one of the ma in tensions.  I have, I realize now, 
been a depressed ma n for  ma ny, ma ny years.  I 
have been an angry ma n as well and unable to 
commit myself to ma ny things. And I now understand 
what all that is about.  I mean there are 
psychological dime nsions to all of this that I 
don™t even know if they
™re important to speak 
about whether this is pure quote unquote history 
or -- there are people who to this day suffer 
because of what happene d to them during the wa
r. There are others like myself who have 
problems because of what happened right after the 
war because denial was the order of the day.  
And it meant that those of us who are younger coul
d not delve into our story.  I have always 
when I was a young ma n living with my parents aske
d them about the war, terrifically curious, 
as I am now. And there was a way of finding 
my  own voice and my own story.  But when it 
came to asking questions about the people I was w
ith, what happened to them, what was it like, 
I always came up against some  for m of denial, al
ways, alwa ys.  In 1985, I think it was the year, 
it was the year before my  father died, I was 
visiting my parents who 
since 1972 moved back to 
Holland.  I was determined to find out more about
 my history and about these people, the De 
Chot fa mily. And I told them, I said I™m going to
 find out about this.  I™d like you to help me .  
If you don™t, fine but I™m going to do it anyway. We ll my par e nts must have conferred that 

evening and reached a wise decision and said well
 we™ll go with you.  Let™s ma ke a day of it.  
So the next day we drive to this
 area of Holland and we go to a City Hall of a town nearby to 
find ma ps, name s of people. We  don™t  find mu
ch but we drive around and we drive to where 

my father thinks the farm was. Well it tu
rns out it™s a major highway right now. There™s 
nothing there -- it™s  obliterated but we  do pa
ss through what™s  the ot
her town where my 
brother/cousin was hidden and he was like fift
een kilome ters from me  and nobody knew.  But 
we saw the house that he  was hidden in and we 
recognized it because we had a photo that was 

made right after the war and it showed the same 
wrought iron fence, a very beautiful intricate 
design and it was imme di ately clea
r.  My brother who was really 
my first cousin was taken care 
of by a woman, Mrs. De Fries, 
a very fine woma n, a religious
 woma n who had a hard time  
giving him up.  But after the war my
 parents stayed in close cont
act with her and in the early 
fifties she came  and spent part of a summer vacat
ion with us.  My parents in some  ways were 
very wise. They knew that the separation be
tween us and our foster parents would be 
problematic and in some  way no ma tter what peop
le did out of the best
 of intentions there 
would be problems. And I realiz
e this now.  I see a ther apist twice a week which is enormously 
helpful.  It™s  paid for by the Dutch governme nt. A
nd I talk about all this stuff and I never talked 

about this before and I™ve come  to some  understandings and one of the things I™ve come  to 

understand is that we were given up for hiding with
 the best of intentions -- out of nothing but 

love and care.  But it still caused us problems.  
And it™s I feel a terrible dilemma for my parents 
that out of the best of 
intentions we were damne d if we di
d and we were damned if we didn™t 
and we have this to deal with 
and it ma kes me , I was going to use 
the word angry, the truth is I 
am outraged and livid that I should now have to 
deal with this stuff in my  lifetime that I™m a 
ma n who ha s a hard time relaxing, who does not feel
 safe and secure in the world, I™m so angry 
at that and to be gifted with life 
but to be born at a terrible time .  
 

Q: Do you want to tell me a little bit ab
out how your cousin came to live with you? 
 

A: My cousinAndy™s parents were Cheel, Macheel 
and his mother Maricha, Marie. They went 
underground but they were caught and they peri
shed in -- I call him my
 brotherAndy, it™s a 
habit.  My brother ™s father which is not my fa
ther perished a few weeks before the liberation.  
He was shot on one of the ma rches fromAuschwi t z.  My mother, his mother perished in ™44.  I 

have an album here, of course you can™t see it on 
tape, that a distant rela
tive in Holland ma de 
for us where it™s a genealogical tracing of the fa
mily and in it we have
 listings of people and 
under the listing where it says when they died,where they died we have, well here it says 

Holocaust to say that he peri
shed -- Judah Zome r plak some  of
 my mother ™s family.  People 
perished inTr eblinka; they perished inAuschwitz,
 they perished in Sobibor.  So my brother ™s 
parents perished, his mother in the camp. The 
adults at the time  they were deciding to go 
underground ma de this agreement, that whoever 
survived would take in the children who, God 
willing, survived.  It turned out that my 
brother,Andy was taken in by my parents. 
 

Q: How did they find him?  

 

A: How did they find him?  They found him -- my 
fa ther found me , my brother, my cousin Sylvia, 
my cousinYa naka.  Just by tracing he found us a
ll, quite remarkable.  He found us and I always 
reme mber knowing thatAndy was my
 brother. What did I know from first cousin.  So me time I 

think when he was ten or eleven years old inAm
erica my parents sat us down and told us the 
story of his parents. And I reme mbe r  -- I don™t 
know how my brother to
ok it in. I have no idea 
how he took it in.  I reme mber going to bed at ni
ght and crying and feeling very sorry forAndy.  
My father came in the room and said to me, just
 because he™s your cousin doesn™t  me an we love 

him less than you which I suppose it™s the transver
se saying it doesn™t  mean we love you less 
than him. And at the time I felt very, very sad.  
And I always in my heart felt very sad about my 
brother.  I now have come  to understand it was my
self I was feeling sad for, that I wa s feeling 
sad for not knowing my foster parents. 
 
Q: You were the same age basically?  

 

A: Yeah we were three months different.  He wa s three months older.  He died in 1979.  He had a 
ma ssive heart attack.  He , I feel very strongl
y, wa s a ma n who was plagued by what happened 
during the war. When he  knew his parents perish
ed and he was adopted and he never, I think 
me tabolized any of that stuff.  Unfor t unately 
after the war the advice th
at my parents and ma ny 
people like them was given was one of --oh you™
ll love your children, you feed them, you take 
care and everything will be okay.  No one knew a
ny different.  No one knew that there was a 
psychological dime nsion that would come  up.  I thi
nk my brother stewed on this stuff for a very 
long time.  He was a ferocious smoker, nervous
 habit.  He became a puppeteer.  He had a 

puppet theater and he traveled all over the countr
y and he settled inTulsa Oklahoma.  He was 
ma rried for a while. That didn™t work out.  He
 was a hard person.  I say hard in terms of 
texture.  He lived his life ve
ry hard and he was very trouble
d by it all and unfortunately we 
didn™t have the advantage of having some  kind of
 therapy or having the 
right kind of attention 
that we do now and I always feel bad thatAndy 
died prematurely and that the war reached out 
and took him. When he died I had the task of 
calling up my parents late 
at night who lived in 
Europe to tell them about it. And I vowed to 
mys e lf at that time that I would take care of 
myself so that I would never have to have 
someone call my parents up and tell them what 

happened.  It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. 
 Every time some one in my fa mily dies, I feel 

it™s not a ma tter of people passing 
on as nature designed it but 
all the me mories of our losses 
and our feeling betrayed come s b
ack.  It™s  not just some one dy
ing, it™s the war again. And I 
don™t know how other people like myself experience that. This is my experience. 
 

Q: What did your parents do then imme di
ately after they got the kids together? 

 

A: We  moved toAmsterdam.  My father got 
work and even when my parents were hidden 
underground they talked about th
ey decided they were going to 
go toAme r ica and they were 
going to teach each other English which they di d. They taught each ot her a bit of English.  

Cory and Jan learned a little English. They we
re going toAmerica.  My family and Cory and 
Jan, the people who hid them, stayed very close 
after the war. There are always ironies in 

history and one of the ironies is 
that, for our fa mily, it™s  been a 
privilege and a delight to have 
had these new people in our lives, Cory and Ja
n, who I™ve always calledTa nta Cory and Omi 
Jan aunt and uncle and whom I™m in touch with 
and very close to. When
 I go to Holland I see 
them. And when I got ma rried in 1982 they came  with my parents here so that was fun.  So we 

were all very close after the war.  My father went
 back into the restaurant  business.  He worked 
for a woma n whose name was De Haas who had 
a number of restaurants and he was her ma in 
ma nager.  She was in the camps.  She survived 
the camps.  She opened up a restaurant again. It 

was on the Centeur Bahn inAmsterdam which was a well known shopping street. The 

restaurant  was a well- known place.  But while 
he was working there after the war he still had 
on his mi nd he was going toAmerica and they di d that because we have relatives here. We  had 

what you would call a ma triarch aunt, Rose, Rose
 Blitz Gossler who in 1945 right after the war 
came to Holland ro see who was left who she coul
d help. At the time  there was a conversation 
between her and my father that when he would 
come toAme r ica she would help him set up in 
the Deli business which never transpired, which b
ecame a little chicken bone in the throat for a 

few years.  So we had family here who sponsored us. You needed to have a sponsor, some one 
who could swear that you would not become  a ward 
of the state.  So we sailed here on the New 
Amsterdam and came here onAugust 12, 1949 and I 
reme mbe r  comi ng and myAunt Rose was 
there to greet us with some  other relatives w
ho I don™t recall. And she mentioned some thing to 
me  in English that I should r
un up to this guard, this police officer and say -- and I didn™t  know 
what it was and I went over and blabbed it to hi
m and he smiled and that was it.  So my first 
words in English were a mystery to me except fo
r the police officer.  My parents very quickly 
started to ma ke a life for themselves here, 
determined to put everything behind us.And, of 
course, my parents are people who have had a hi
story before the war. They™ve had a history 
that they think of fondly and 
speak of fondly.  So the war was an interruption, a terrible 

interruption.  For the re
st of us who were younger it was our 
first experience in the world. We  
had nothing to go back to, to draw from, to support us
.  So it was different for my par e nts. They 
were able to say, let™s build 
a life. Those of us who were
 younger had some  real trauma tic 
problems.  I understand that some  -- we were in 
some way victims of child abuse. We were 

trauma tized children.  I know from
 my cousin that one of my c
ousins had a very difficult time  
in going back with her Mom and Dad.  She want
ed to be back with her foster parents. 
 

Q: How old wa s she? 

 

A: She is two years older than me so at the time 
she was five. And there was an incide nt where I 
guess she got to be so whiny and nagging and impossible that her mother filled the suitcase, put 

it on the front steps and said, go. 
 Get with the program or go. 
And the rest of us got the 
me ssage; it was a very serious me ssage.  So we all got with the program. You know it™s a 

complex thing. You wished that your parents were
 smarter, were wiser but they were who they 
were and they tried their very best. 
 
Q: Did you ever feel estrangeme nt this whole time in a sense? 
 

A: No, I never felt estranged from my pa rents. Th
e odd thing is my parent
s did very well by me .  
And I think of them very fondly; I mi ss my fath
er terribly.  I™m sorry my mother ™s living in 
Holland and we can™t  be closer.  But I know that 
I grew up as a very angry person.  Right after 
the war I was hospitalized.  I washospitalized.  Le t™s see now, thr
ee months after the liberation I 

was hospitalized for three months.  I had I 
guess what you called chorea or what™s  commonly 
called St .Vitus Dance, I had a nervous disorder. 
 So clearly I was paying for it.  I reme mber 
being very well taken care of in the hospital. 
 It was a Catholic hospital and I reme mb er the 
nuns.  I reme mber like you see on theTV program 
the nuns with the giant wings on their heads, 
real nun, old world nun.  I reme mber being very we
ll taken care of and then when we came to 
America, a few weeks after we were here my fa
ther had a serious stomach operation, ulcer. A 
few months again Ialsohad a 
nervous breakdown.  So there wa
s stuff going on. There™s the 
will to survive and get along with
 it and then there™s the body tel
ling you I can™t  take anymore.  
There™s the psyche tellin
g you I can™t take anymore.  I need down time; I need time off.  So I 
reme mber my parents doing very well by me
.  I™m not some one who complains about my 
parents.  But I also know that I grew up as a 
very angry young ma n with
 a terribly sarcastic 
sense of humor; always saw the dark side of things first; was very pol
itically active in the 
sixties in the civil rights and wa
r stuff and even in the seventies.  My anger was comi ng from 
my experiences as a child.  I know that when I wa
s born my mother was not able to really take 
care of me well because she was just a wreck.  Pe
ople around me  were a wreck filled with fear 
and dread and I must have taken that in as they
 say with your mother ™s  milk even though there 
was no mother ™s milk.  I had taken that all in
 and I experienced myself as a very anxious 

person. 
 
Q: Now when you moved to the Bright on Beach ar
ea were there primarily other refugees in your 
neighborhood or was there-------? 
 

A: I reme mber only one family.  It was a Hunga
rian fa mily with two boys and I heard from my 
parents that they were in the war too.  But th
ere was never any talk with those families about 
that. We played with thei r children.  But if 
there were other refugee fa milies I di dn™t know 
about it.  People didn™t talk about it to each ot
her. You put it behind you. You deny it; you get 
on with your life. And I think now there was al
so a certain element of sha me about it all among 
other feelings.  It was like people were in the cl
oset with their stuff. 
And I grew up in Beach 
Haven.  I have enjoyable me mories of my ch
ildhood also being a nervous
 kid but not a very 
intense religious quality to our family™s life.  
We  would have Passover. We  would set a nice 
table and have a wonderful meal. There was nothing said. We  would celebrate Christma s. We  

had a lot of intermarriage fa mily which you have
 with Jewish families in Europe, a lot of 
intermarriage. 
 

Q: Who did your parents associ
ate with once they came here? 

 

A: They associated with their family. There wa
s my father ™s brother Mo
rr itz survivedAuschwitz 
and Mauthausen. These two brothers took care of each other; they survived. They paid a 

terrible price for it. They died, one of heart, one
 of cancer. They associated with family. They 
didn™t make friends.  It was something I always
 found very peculiar.  
I suppose in Holland it 

was that way too. There was a large fa mily before
 the war; your fa mily were your friends.  My 
mother who now lives inAmsterdam in Beth S
holom which is a kind of quasi retireme nt home 
has a very nice circle of about 
four or five wome n her age who have similar stories who they™re 
very close with.  It™s ve ry sweet. After dinner 
they sit in each ot her ™s small  apartments and 
they™ll watchTV and ha ve coffee and chat. And th
en when it™s  time to go to bed they™ll kiss 
each other goodnight and they™ll go to their separa
te homes, rooms. And it™s sweet.  It™s not 
some thing that she had as a younger woma n here.  
Her friends were alwa ys the other -- sister-
in-laws.  She had sister-in-law friends. 
 

Q: I think that™s typical of the European rath
er than------but  I was w
ondering si nce they came  
outŠ 
 

A: My mother did ma ke friends with the wome n in her shop.  She worked in the garment trade for 
ma ny years, mostly Italian wome n. And she le
arned to cook very good Italian food from that 
and she speaks of it very fondly.  She says the pos
t-war years were some  of the best years of her 
life; I saw the boys grow up. We  had a 
good time.  She reme mbers it very fondly. 
 

Q: So you never had any formal Jewish education of any sort? 

 

A: No, I was, it™s  an interest
ing story I™m glad you asked. A 
few months, about two or three 
months before it was time to have my brother an
d I bar mitzvahed we had a local rabbi come  to 
the house and give us rabbi lessons. And at one 
point, it was a very rote
 kind of lesson, we had 

to ﬁzocherﬂ we had to reme mber but we didn™t 
have to understand.  So at one point we  said, 
rabbi what does this mean?  And he said, it doesn™t  ma tter you don™t need to know, just 

reme mber. And I can date my alienation from Judaism from that day, from that mo ment. A 

very unwise thing to say. There mi ght have b
een an agenda that was just  get the boys to 

reme mber it.  Nonetheless it™s not 
an answer I would give if I were
 a rabbi that™s  for sure.  So I 
was not a Jewish person until a few years ago when 
my wife took an interest in Juda ism;  had us 
join a local shul because she wisely unders
tood it was part of the process of me being 
disaffected. At first we would go 
to shul just for the high holiday.
  I™d sit in the back with my 
coat and hat on ready to fl ee at any time feeling 
very uncomfortable always
 feeling like I want 
to cry.  I would go to shul and feel like I want to
 cry. And that™s  the way I feel right now even 
saying it, not feeling welcome, not fe eling safe. 
 I understand now it™s not feeling safe.  For us 
to identify with Judaism was to imme diatel y putti
ng ourselves in touch with everything that was 
dangerous to us. And I at some  point regretted ve
ry much that not only had those bastards taken 
our fa milies they now had taken our culture. And 
I was determined to take that culture back 
within the context of being a 
49 year old ma n living in Cambr i
dge in the latter half of the 
twentieth century swept left  and 
right by secular huma nism, being a 
little bit political ly leftist 
and sympathetic and liberal and fe
eling strongly about certain issues
. Wi thin that context I take 
back my Je wish culture. 
 

Q: I think there™s a lo
t of space for it actually. 
 

A: There is a lot of space for it. The only probl
em is we just realized we joined a rather 
conservative temple where the whole service is
 like a Polish st eeplechase, you know.  I™m still 
reading the commentary and they™r
e finished.  So I™m sort of shopping around for a little more 
contemporary enlightened shul.  Our godson who 
lives in North Ha mpton was going to be bar 
mitzvahed and I was going to be called up to read
 for the first time and decided well I™d better 
do this really well not to embarrass him nor myse lf.  So Lucy and I, my wi fe Lucy and I a year 

before started taking Hebrew lessons
 just so we could read this.  
I coul d read this shor t little 
thing and took Hebrew lessons fo
r about two and a half years so
 I could readTorah and know 
what was being said. And that kind of got us st
arted and every Friday night Lucy and I have  
Shabbat dinner and we do a blessing and when 
we™re not too exhausted from the end of the 
week we™ll read some thing and have found it very
 important to have something that separates 
the work week from rest, to have a mo ment 
of grace, to allow ourselves some  grace even 

though the next day, Saturday, we™re still doing th
ings we have to do. There are time s  where I 
feel I™d like to go to shul even 
though I™ll sit there. I won™t know what™s  being talked about but 
I™ll sit there; I™ll read the commentary. There™ll 
be a Kiddush and I enjoy that.  It™s  hard to lead 
a Jewish life because all the issues for me.  I find it very difficult. 
 

Q: When did you get involved with this– you just
 got involved with the survivor ™s  group after 
they had the Children™s Conference? 
 

A: Yeah, the Children™s Conference was the week of May 5
th
 1991 and we knew about it almost a 
year before and I thought at the ti
me  I didn™t want to go to this conference.  I didn™t wa nt to deal 
with any of this stuff. And then I had started 
going to therapy shortly before the conference and 
talking to my therapist 
about it to help me to understand th
at it was probably a good thing to do.  
And I talked with my cousins w
ho were determined to go and I said well I™ll come  down to 

NewYork and meet you. We  can have lunch 
and see each other but I™m not going to the 
conference.  So we talked and talked and ev
entually I understood that
 it wa s a good thing for 
me  to do.  I went to the conference and it was terr
ific.  I also sort of count for my conscious 
depression to that time and know that my whole li
fe I™ve been depressed.  But it™s all very much 
open and on the surface right now and I give it a na
me .  It™s peculiar because there are times 
when people will see me  and they™ll sa y, hi 
Jack how are you. And the question while only a 
second long feels like a thousand 
light years which gives me  e
nough time to think do I tell them 

how I™m really doing, do I be sociable, do I 
know this person well enough?   Because I don™t 
feel I™m doing well, you know but understand it™s
 a social question but now there are people 
who know my situation.  I was at a dinner a m
onth ago with some  old friends and half the 
people there were ther apists. A
nd at some  point this old friend who hadn™t seen me  in a while 
actually a friend of my wife said, so Jack 
so how are you?  Are you doing any good art work, 
any art, what™s  happening.  I said, well actual
ly I see my therapist 
twice a week I™m very 
depressed, the bottom of the art ma rket has fall
en and there™s not much happening, and you?   
And there™s dead silence and it™s  
sort of like aWoodyAllen scene. 
 
Q: I guess they didn™t invite you anymor e, huh? 

 

A: No, they invited my wife  back to the chorus
.  It™s  in Brookline. There™s a Brookline chorus. 
 

Q: I was just kidding. 

 

A: I know but you know it was important for me  to sa
y it, to give an answer not to sidestep it 
because for people like myself who were younger 
during the war the matter of having a voice is 
crucial. And the ma tter of being able to f
eel our experience was authentic is crucial. 
 

Q: I think the truth of it there are so few childre
n, Jewish children, who survived the war, so few --
and then were reunited with their 
family or something like that.  
There are others who were just 
broken at that point. 
 

A: I think that the numbers some thing like
 25,000 people went underground and some thing like 
16,000 perished were betrayed being underground.  
The statistics are so telling.  In Holland 
before the wa r you had including 25,000 Jewish
 German refugees you had 140,000 Jews in 
Holland. After the war you had 
some thing between 15 and 10 or 
25,000, terrible attrition rate.  
It ma kes me  feel very badly about Europe.  In
 the 1960™s I traveled a lo
t to Europe.  I would 
work here for a while.  I™d save my money.  
I™d go live in Europe; I™d bum around.Those were 
the years you could do that and see 
Europe and I was not that aware of
 my feelings of all of this 
stuff but as time goes by I find myself very angry about Europe. 
 

Q: I was going to ask you about your Dutch identity
. What did your parents do when you got here?  
Did you sort of sublimate?   Did you speak 
Dutch at home or have Dutch customs? 
 

A: We  spoke both at home.  I am very good with languages.  I lost my accent very quickly. What™s 
amusing is that in being with 
this group of hidden children w
ho meets -- we meet once a month 
-- I am one of the few people who doesn™t  have 
an accent and what I enjoy is being with these 
people because this is a circle of people I woul
d have been in had things been better, been 
different.  So it gives me a sense of what it was 
like for my parents, for my fa mily and I enjoy 

it.  So we came  here and I went to school and I 
had -- I want to say hello to Mrs. Harris who in 
the third grade was so wonderful to me .  She he
lped me  to learn English. We  spoke Dutch and 
English at home  but of course 
we started to speak more Englis
h. And I went back to Holland 
for the first time  in 1965 as did my parents alt
hough we went on separate trips -- we met in 
Holland but we went on our separa
te trips. And I ended up livi
ng in Holland for a year in 1965 
because I wanted to learn Dutch again. You 
know I studied French in school and I like 
languages and I wanted to do that.  But as to th
e ma tter of Dutch identity
 it™s very complex for 
me  because being a EuropeanAmerican I like that I have -- whatever it means to be a European 

Jew I like that because it gives me  a certain persp
ective  about what it means to live inAmerica 

in this time in history.  On the other hand I 
find some  of the presumptuous ness and arrogance of 
the Europeans aboutAmerica really shallow and 
I™ve always sort of understoodAmerica is the 
European peasant™s dream come  true.And the onl
y difference betweenAmerica and Europe is 
maybe a hundred years.  But the more I™m in t
ouch with what I feel about my experiences the 
less happy I am with Europe.  I feel 
we have been wretchedly betrayed. 
 
Q: Your parents never gave
 you that sense.  Do you think they felt that too? 
 

A: My parents never -- we never talked about in 
such a national context of
 saying Europe betrayed 
us.  It was Ge rmany, it was Hitler, it was Dutc
h collaborators.  But you can take any country in 

Europe and it happened. What I also find inte
resting is that what the European Christian 
community is some thing that the Europeans ha
ve been doing to people 
of color all over the 
world for a few hundred years. What the Germans did in southwestAfrica, what the Dutch did 

in Indonesia and what the Belgians did in the 
Congo, what the English did and what the French 
did they did it to everybody el
se who was different. And when it happened in their own 
homeland all of a sudden it became a terrible da
rk enigma  about Hitler and Hitlerism and I 
really do attribute it -- 
the little that I know about history-- that it was a European phenome non 
and the groundwork was laid by the church, by th
e Christian church. And I mean people have 
to own up to that, they have to own up to that. 
 

Q: Can I ask you about your art?   Do you feel 
that in any way your art ma nifests some  of your 
–..? 
 

A: Well actually it does in so far as that  my art ha
s nothing to do with my ex
perience.  My art is a 
complete denial of my e xperience and it is such an
 enigma  to me .  My artistic voice does not in 
any way include my expe rience and I see that as
 a function of denial.  
It perplexes me . And 
some ti me s, you know some  morning I™ll wake up a
nd say boy I wish I could really express all 
that stuff in my art.  But then I think of oh well but
 then I would be so lite
ral, literal or  pedantic 
or rhetorical and I don™t want to be that.  It™s no
t what I draw on for my ar
t.  My art what I draw 
on is from my beauty, my love of beauty, the love
 of what™s  beautiful in
 the world, the love of 
what™s  beautiful between people. 
 I also think there are aestheti
c problems with dealing with 
horrors of such ma gnitude and I™m not 
the person to do it so
 I leave it alone. 
 

Q: Have you looked at any othe
r so-called Holocaust artists? 

 

A: Ye s, well I have looked -- there™s a book of ar
t fromAuschwi t z, things
 that were painted on 
walls and I™m absolutely struck by how powerful it 
is.  It ™s different than people today who will 
ma ke art that™s about that.  It does not strike achord in me .  I also in some  way -- ElieWi esel 

talks some how about that you can™t  ma ke art out of 
it, how in some  way it™s so inexplicable that 
all ar t will fall shor t and I think even successful Ho
locaust Shoah art falls short. To maintain a 
certain kind of integrity it would 
have to, it would have to. And 
I always felt for myself that art 
is about redemption and I don™t think–– 
 

Q: It™sveryidealistic. 

 

A; No, it™s not idealistic.  It™s as I think that th
e way in which the creative pr oc ess functions in each 
of us. You draw on aspirations, you draw on hope
, you draw on a sense of all things in their 

connectedness rather than being dispert. And you look for the sacr
ed, what™s  sacred in life.  
This is I think what motivates art and other people
 of course have anothe
r sense of it. And for 

now the Shoah is I don™t think there™s a place 
for redemption right now.  I mean I understand 
that in our group that we meet
 once a month we have been ta
lking about among other things 
about how civilization has a need to
 deny and has a need to forget.   It™s a shame ful period and it 
needs to forget and it will do this in ma ny ways.  One way will be the mo st banal expression of 

people who absolutely deny it happened.  Then 
there is the ma tter of having perpetrators and 
victims be seen as equi vocal in some  way sort 
of like the Blitburg visit.
 We ™re all victims of 
war. We ll that™s  so but that™s  beside this poi
nt and that over time who 
knows how the story of 
this thing will be told. We  can witness the expe
rience of theAfricanAm
ericans in this country, 
the horror of that and how that™s  
already been glossed over. And I 
think that civilizations have a 
need to forget their shame and this is why I 
insist upon telling my story and say yes to being 
interviewed to anyone w
ho™s willing to listen. 
 

Q: Can I ask you some  more questions ma ybe abou
t your parents, about th
eir personalities?   If 
we™re going to include them in our project I 
would need to–.. I thi
nk I™ll switch the tape 
though. We ™re on the second tape of
 the interview with JackTr om
pettor. We ™re talking about 
his parents now. Which parent
 would you like to
 start with? 
 

A: We ll I can tell you some  things about them relativ
e to the war experiences 
that are interesting in 
terms of personality.  One is that my mother ta
lks of having found my father so very appealing 
when they were younger because he was a quiet fe
llow and she liked that about him.  It turns 

out that during the war he went through this pe
rsonality change and he became  a gregarious 
chatty chap.  He™s  a ma n who loved to talk to 
strangers as I am and he was very sociable, he 
was fun, he was easy to get along with.  So he 
went through a real pers
onality change.  My 
mother is more of a worrier.  She does the worrying for us and it™
s sort of an unfair 
responsibility I think.  It™s  enough 
to be a mother but then to have to do the worrying. And she -
- well it™s hard to really talk 
about her without defa mi ng her. 
 

Q: Other people have had this experience too. 

 

A: Ye s.We ll you know we accept our mothers and fa thers as gods and forget that they are 
beautifully huma n. Wha t  can I say about my pare
nts?   I don™t  really know except that I know in 
America my  father worked very hard.  I™d s
ee him come  home  and after dinner he™d sit on a 
stool in front of theTV  and within five mi nut
es he was asleep, he was out.  On Sundays he 
would go with the other me n in the family and 
some ti me s some  of the boys. then we would go 
watch the soccer games. All the ethnic clubs in
 Ne wYork City played soccer with each other 
and we™d do that. And they belonged to the 
Holland-American sporting 
club which would have 
a NewYear ™s party.Which would have functions
, events.  So they kept within their Dutch 

circle. Any friends that they ma de outside of th
e family were still Dutchmen.  In some ways I 
regret that they did not branch out mo re. 
 

Q: It sounds to me  that like fo
r example your father must have 
been extreme l y strong-willed to 
have ma de the decision not to 
register and things like that. 
 

A: Ye s, you know I experienced my father as a 
very ordinary person and I don™t mean that 
ﬁordinaireﬂ.  I mean just -- he was just a person.  Bu
t he is very creative inlife.  In the short haul 
he™s very creative.When a crisis would come  up he would be real quick 
and he would be really 

on the case and I know when he and my mother 
went underground my mother did mo st of the 
hemming and hawing of course.  
I say of course, I don™t know. A
nd he had to really convince 
her as well as her brother ™s letter that said 
don™t bring the red baby carriage -- had to convince 

her they had to do it.  So she would do a lot of
 hemming and hawing but she™s a very expressive 
person.  My mother is the one who I™ve done muc h
 of my talking with.  
We  are both connected 
very emotionally in that way.  It™s been troub
lesome  as well because of that.  My father I™ve 
experienced a little more distantly.   Guess it™s ve
ry typical in that way.  I always experienced 
them both as being very supportive but there are th
ings I never really got 
into with my father 
that I would get into w
ith my mother.  My mother would 
have wonderful provocative argume nts 
and she was the more expressively emotional one. 
 

Q: I know its hard having observed your parents, 
interacting with other people.  Do you know how 
they were generally thought of? 
 

A: My parents in the family have had a good reput
ation, very good reputation. When I talk with 
my cousins and they talked about my parents th
ey always talked about how friendly and sweet 
and thoughtful they were. And this is how I™ve experienced them, asa thoughtful people who 

were very practical at life and also ha d pl
aced a premium on being a decent person. There was 
a clear me ssage about you had to be an ethical person. 
 

Q: And they behaved that way as well, it seems?  

 

A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. 

 

Q: Is there anything else ma ybe that you know a
bout their childhoods or th
eir youth or their –?   
You say they were involved in these social de
mo cratic -- was that a teenageerhood already or? 
 

A: Yeah, sixteen, seventeen on. You know you™re in a 
particular class and your
 social life at that 
time was very much involved in political 
groups, the young people™s socialist league or 
something like that. And what it meant was it pr
ovided a social life with a kind of mi nima l 
political context for young people and some ti me s 
it would serve the purpose of groomi ng more 
seriously politically committed people.  
But it was also neighborhood stuff, it was 

neighborhood stuff.  My parents liv
ed with a lot of relatives as
 did ma ny people then and they 
enjoyed that . They did a lot of their pl
aying and socializing 
with those cousins. 
 

Q: Did they have any hobbies or musi
c interests or a
nything like that? 
 

A: Let™s see now, no, I know that
 during the war my father got
 involved in ma rquetry, wood 
ma rquetry.  During the thirties 
in Europe it was very popular.  
You™d get marquetry sets.  Like 
let™s say here its Scrabble or hula-hoop which da
tes me.  But there it was marquetry and during 
the war JanVan Nomberg and my father managed to
 get hold of these ma
rquetry sets and ma ke 
these little pictures. They were copies of fa mous
 old masters and my mother has my dad™s.  It™s 
in my dowry. I get it when it™s my turn and it™s a replication of a fa mousVe rmeer painting of the 

house whereVe r meer lived and it™s rema rkable b
ecause the br ick is all 
these small pieces of 
wood and the mortar in between are 
all these tiny, tiny little splints
 of pieces of wood. They did 
this during the war when they were undergr
ound to keep themselves from going cuckoo.  I 
don™t know of any other habit, hobb
ies my father had.  My mother liked to sing when she was 
younger.  I know I grew up loving op
era and I attribute that to her.
 These people worked a lot.  
The me ssage here was work, work so–.And I am an
 artist and that™s my work and other people 
would consider that a hobby so what other peop
le would consider a hobby I took on as a ma jor -
- as an occupation. 
 

Q: Is there anything else that you would like to
 add about your own experience or that of your 
fa mily, your relatives. 
 
A: We ll at the expense of sounding whiny, I woul
d say that my fa mily like ma ny, ma ny people got 
screwed by Europe and we came here in 1949 and 
my parents had to start from scratch again 
and never could quite build it up to where they 
had in Holland. They worked very hard in 
Holland and they did well for themselves. And I do 
marvel actually at my parents the ability to 
go into hiding, provide for themselves and survive. When I was in my teens and going through 

my rebellion I pooh-poohed my parents. What did they know?   I knew much more than they 

did. And now, of course, I think what a little s
not-nose I was to think that. They had to live 
through and ma ke life decisions through some thing 
I have not had to and hope to God I and no 
one else will ever have to ma ke. And they were
 ordinary people, simple 
people and they rose to 
the occasion and the people that hid them were
 ordinary human beings and they rose to the 
occasion.Those were the heroes.  My parents were the heroes. The people that hi d them were 

the heroes. And the stories they tell of what th
ey did during the war to survive is rema rkable.  
My mother taught Cory how to sew. What they
 did -- they would get 
clothing and they would 
take it apart and rema ke things out of it and th
ey would sell or exchange that for foodstuffs.  
And when my parents were hidden underground no 
one on the street in the town, of course, 
knew they were being hidden. The parents of Co
ry knew but not her younge
r brother.  It was 
too dangerous to let people know. And Jan woul
d get food.  He had those wide pants at the 
time, very wide flair pants, very popular then, 
like bell-bottoms  in some  way and they sewed 
these cloth bags to the inside of
 their pants that they
 would fill with foodstuffs and he would 
bicycle home with them. They also had to be ca
reful because they coul dn™t  trade for food that 
would be evident that there was 
more than two people in the house
hold eating so it had to be all 
done in different pl aces and as my mother tells 
it they were never hungry during the war. They 
always had enough foodstuffs. And she would take
 great pleasure going down to the cellar and 
looking at the shelves and seeing what
 food they were able to store. 
 

Q: Interesting. 

 

A: It is interesting.  I know I lived on a farm 
from 1977 to 1980. Actually I did far ming in New 
England from 1973 to 1980 when I lived with some
one and we raised, we  had a milk cow, we 
raised hogs, we raised chickens, 
we raised sheep, we raised a lot of our own foodstuffs. And I 
would go down to the cellar and I would put up 
forty quarts of applesauce, sixty quarts of 
toma toes, freezer filled with meat
, freezer filled with
 vegetables, cords of wood stacked up -- 
very New England. And I would go look at all 
this and stand there lik
e a proud man with my 
hand in my suspenders looking at it and not 
at the time understanding what was going on was 
some  kind of replication of some  need that my 
parents went through.  My parents went back to 
Holland in 1972 because they wanted to retire and 
they could do it there rather than here and it 
was also the year that I went 
to live inVe rmont during the su mmer and ended up staying there 
and ended up actually having left NewYork City 
and shortly after ended up in a farm situation 
and I do wonder now how I had replicated my wa r e
xperiences.  In a way it ma kes me  feel very 
bad that my agenda was so unconscious that my
 going into this farm and farming was a ma tter 
of going into hiding.  I had a big 
beard, I had long hair, 
I looked very different than I do now.  I 
was in hiding and it ma kes m feel very badly that 
I still had to act this out
 and it happened at the 
same time as my parents decided to go back to 
Europe and again it was a kind of a split with my 
fa mily, a separation.  I understand it now.  
 

Q: What motivated them to actua
lly -- you said because they could retire there now.  Have you 

decided to continue this interview after all?  
 
A: Ye s.  I want to read this l
ittle piece, that is what my wife 
and I translated from my mother ™s 
journal that she spent seven y
ears writing about her and the family™s wartime experience. And 
what™s interesting is she has said that  in writing 
this it made her feel much
 better.  She™s really 
the only one in her family that even talks about th
is stuff.  For years my brother and I even after 
we moved out of our parents™ home when we™d 
come home to visit would ask them about the 
war. And inevitably every time we got together 
the conversation would come  back to that and 
there were questions.  My brothe
r and I always had to ask questi
ons. At  one point we  finally 
decided let™s get Mom a tape recorder and see if
 she™d really do this. And she did. And she 

spent seven years writing this stuff down.  
And it was done without a 
typewriter, without a 
personal computer, just by hand. And she got so 
involved with it that when Cory wanted to go 
out with her shopping or some thing Celene woul
dn™t  go.  She really wanted to do this and 
complete it and as I said she felt in a way that 
a  burden was taken off her chest. There™s one 
little piece I want to re
ad that could give you an idea of what it was like at the time  that my 
parents ma de the decision to go underground and to
 provide  and look for a place for me .  On the 
fifteenth of Nove mber Eddie (which was my mo
t her ™s  other brother) visited us with great 
sadness because of what had happened to Father, Mo
ther and our brother Jack.  During this visit 
he told us he had an underground address for Dad 
and myself and a separa
te one for you, Jack.  
It™s  written for you because this whole ma nuscrip
t was written for my brother and myself.  So 
that™s the form it takes. Very distressed with 
the idea of parting from 
our baby, Eddie tried to 
convince us that your chances, Jack 
were better without us
.  If we were captu
red he explained at 
least you mi ght survive.  He also knew it would 
be easier to find a separate place for a couple 

without children. They would not bring to the underground family the additiona l burden and 

security risk of children crying 
or needing me dical attention and 
such. All night Eddie talked 
with us. Wh at an extraordinary dema nd -- give up
 our three month old child
 to pe rfec t strangers 
and without opportunities to visit. We  had no id
ea how long such an arrangement would have 
to last, a mo nth, half a year, long
er, who knew. The next day we ta
lked with my brother Maritz.  
In the serious way that™s  so typical of him he asked Da
d and me  to consider the following           
:  imagine the German police 
catching you, he said, this coul
d happen at any mo me nt. The 
baby will fall into their ha nds. Wouldn™t you rather have a child with Ollie and me  (Ollie was 

his wife) until Eddie takes them to a hiding place
?   Dad and I found a lot of truth in what he 
said.  Here was a chance so ma ny people wanted
 but had no opportunity of getting.  How could 
we pass it up. We  felt that no ma tter what we did we would be doomed i f we didn™t do 

anything. Al ready the families of several of our
 br others and si sters had been torn apart by 
arrests and deportations. A few 
months ago, Case, the husband of Dad™s sister, Bepe, had been 
taken to CampWe sterbork leaving Bepe at hom
e alone with their two 
year- old daughter.  
We sterbork was located in Northern Holland and the 
Jews were sent from there to the different 
concentration camps,Auschwitz, Sobibor.  Maritz
Tr ompettor, who was my father ™s brother, 
had been in the same  camp for half a year by th
en.  His wife, Fe mma and their daughters were 
still at home . The children™s home in which Femma worked was soon seized by the SS and the 

Green Police. They captured the Jewish infants 
and sent them with their mothers to be gassed 
or destroyed in one way or a
nother.  But Fe mma protected he
rself and her daughters and then 
found underground addresses for each of them. This
 is myAunt Fe mma who died a year ago.  
She was very active in finding hiding places for 
children.  She was a very brave and very strong 
and feisty woma n. The thing is ma ny people we
re brave and feisty and strong and everything 
but in some  way it was luck.  It was luck that 
you survived but it di dn™t necessarily mean that  
you were lucky or that being lucky meant you were 
better than anyone else
.  My brother Maritz 
and his fa mi ly were still intact  
and living at theT
r ansvaalstraat.  My mother ™s  brother Maritz 

was born in England because his pa
rents took a trip to England a
nd he was born there so he had 
dual citizenship.  He had British and Dutch citi
zenship.  He eventually ended up in Bergen-
Belsen but Belsen was not an extermination 
camp and because he was a British citizen they 
didn™t kill him.  It also allowed for his wife  O
llie to bring food packages to him which helped 
him to survive.  Eddie, another brot he r, becau
se he was involved with
 the resistance moved 
around from one temporary hidi ng place to anot he r.  He never went permanently underground.  

Indeed with his pure blue eyes and curly blond ha
ir he thought he would 
be taken for a German 
rather than a Dutch Jew.  Brazen as he  was he 
had been ridi ng trains filled with Germans and 
these expe riences gave hi m this idea.  Of course 
he did not know that in time  he woul d be the 
victim of betrayal.  He wa s betrayed.  My cl
ose friend Marie which is my  brother ™s/cousin™s 
mother which isAndy™s mother, another of Dad™
s sisters was still at home  with her husband, 
Cheel and their six month old infantAndy.  Like 
us they lived with all the worries and fears of 
keepingAndy out of the hands of the pack of th
ieves.  By now Dad™s ot
her sister, Judith, her 
husband and their four year old daughter Lane
y had been underground for three months. With 
great difficulty and sadness we struggled over 
our decision to go into hiding. There was not 

even a guarantee that all woul
d go well underground.  Inasmuch as no guarantee was to be 
found with any choice we  ma de we finally decided 
to go ahead with Eddie™s plan.  He promised 
that within a week we would be told all the details
. This was the best of the worst of situations.  
Maritz™s wife Ollie also had to agree with
 the ar rangeme nt because she would be also 
responsible for caring for our son, me.  No one 
knew for how long.  It co
uld take two days, it 
could take  a month.  But Ollie agreed without ta
lking to us.  It was good enough for her that my 

brothers wanted it. We  have alwa
ys been grateful to her.  Ollie
 died two and a half months ago 
and I wrote her daughter and her step-daughters a le
tter saying some thing like this about what a 
decent person she was and how we owe our thanks 
to her and I wrote this letter as -- it was 
ostensibly a condolence letter but 
I wanted to say some thing to 
her daughters about what a fine 
person she was. We  cared a great deal for our fa
mily.  Sisters, brothers
 and children were heavy 
on our hearts and particularly the old people.  
Wh at did one do with the old people.  Grandma 
and GrandfatherTr ompettor were still living at 
home . They were fortunate for the mo me nt 
because Shul s, one of their sons, one of my 
father ™s brothe rs, and his fami ly lived nearby 
allowing them to help his parents through thick a
nd thin.  But with his loving attention to them 
and his recent service period away from home  (he had to serve 
in the army) he hadn™t been able 

to find an underground address. The old people u
nderstood that for them life was finished.  One 
sees this now on the photographs taken of them fo
r their identity pa pers.  Even if they went 
underground, which seldom happened, their chance fo
r survival was very slim. As long as the 
war continued it became clear to them that they 
would eventually be left by themselves, most 
likely never again to be with the people they 
so dearly loved.  Often enough there was talk of 
the underground and so with great grief they bega
n to live with it (meaning the children going 
underground). Thus was some thing we simply 
could not continue to think about.  If one 
became too sensitive and afraid then one mi ght le
t an opportunity go by. We  grew resolute. We  

did not tell anyone about our plan other than Fa
ther and MotherTr ompettor. You, Jack and I 
had recently visited them and I did not expect 
them to say goodbye to us again.  From their 
gestures at our departure I saw that for them
 it was a real goodbye, not just a good-day until the 
next time .  Clearly they suspect
ed some thing.  Every evening fo
r years Dad visited them for a 
few mi nutes.  Now he went to tell them of 
our decision.  How does one present such a sad 
prospect.  Like their other children we  too kept th
e details for ourselves for the sake of security.  
You took nobody into your confidence. This was what
 the bad society had ma de of us.  Later as 

it turned out all those who we
re still at home except for Un
cles Jules eventually went 
underground but it consoled us lit
tle to learn that we were not 
the only ones who had to leave 
parents. This is a very telling p
i ece which always
 perplexes me.  For me the leaving was not so 

difficult because my parents were not here anym
ore. This is my mother talking because her 
parents were already taken away. Wh at I have 
left if they were still at home.  Dad asked 
himself this question.  No good answer was found. Today, forty years later, I do not think I 
would have ma de this choice again. The twentieth 
of Nove mber 1942 arrives. 
 It is early in the 
morning and I am home  alone when Eddie come s to
 our apartment. We  must be ready before 

eight o™clock that night, he says, 
to begin with the fi rst part of 
our journey into hiding. As we 
had originally agreed he himself--------- (let ™s see if I can find the other 
piece of that).  Eddie 
himself would bring us.  Everythi
ng was planned that way.  Jackie
, that™s  me , would be picked 
up by my brother Maritz at seven o™ clock in 
the evening and from thereon a place would be 
found in the children™s house in Neimachen. This 
was just as Eddie said it would happen from 
the agreed upon plans made earlie
r on. We  were expected to pay 300 guilder a month to the 
children™s house. We  did just 
this even though in this time  th
is amount of money was a large 
amount for working class people.  It was organize
d so that we would have a particular amount 
with us and Eddie would hold on to the rest. 
 In case some thing we nt wrong with us there 
would still be enough money for a definite time to
 pay the kinder house.  In the beginning we 
could know if we had enough money or not for th
e duration of the war. We  naively thought it 
would be possible. As  I have 
said as soon as I knew the plan 
that morning Chait ver Kike the 
neighbor and I delivered our household goods to he
r apartment with the help of her husband.  
This is a neighbor who was very friendly with my
 parents who agreed to buy their furniture so 
my parents could raise money and they knew 
what was going on. When you went underground 
and you left you couldn™t leave abruptly becaus
e then imme di ately some one would be on your 
tail so my parents planned this over time so
 they could slowly leave..They would leave 
someone pa ying some of their bills
 and it would be months before 
it was realized that they were 
gone. And my mother has often ta
lked about how she felt she had 
to be like a criminal.  She 
had to think like a criminal because the law was 
in the hands of the criminals.  She as an 

ordinary person had to think like that to surviv
e.  Dad was quickly warned at work I do not 
know by whom. At four  o™clock he came home  
which was very unusual forThursday when he 
usually came home about eight o™cloc
k or later.  He just told hi
s boss he had to go away for a 
little while.  Because it was so busy onThursday
s this boss told him to be quick and come  back 
as soon as possible but Dad knew better.  He then 
went for the last time to his mother and father 
who were in a dejected mood and 
not without reason. They had ju
st before found out that their 
daughter Judith, her husband and child,Yope and 
Laney were betrayed and handed over to the 
Germans. We will never know if theTr ompettor 
grandparents knew that Laney was in fact still 
with her benefactor having gotten away from he
r executioners. This is my cousin Laney who 
lives in Holland.  I™m almost absolutely cert
ain they did not know ot
herwise we would have 
heard it from Uncle Jules.  For Dad at the mo ment while this was indeed a grim me ssage he 

tried not to be disheartened.  On the contrary th
is news of his sister strengthened him in his 
resolve to go into hiding.  In answer to your 
question about thei
r character. Y
ou never really 
know the full depth I suppose of your character 
until some thing extraordinarily intervenes and 
then if you™re lucky you rise to the occasion.  Da
d also told hi s parent s what we were going to 

do that ni ght but what could these poor people do but accept our leaving them. This was the 

last time that Dad was ever agai n to be with 
his parents.  Here was the new episode between 

parents and children finished under the saddest 
of circumstances.  Still to come  were ma ny 
more mo me nts of separation.  Dad came  home and 
told me  that what he had just learned from 
his parents about his sister and her family.  I fe
lt very sad but now realized that we had come  
this far and we definitely had to continue with
 our plans, the sooner the better.  
And this of 
course then is my mother ™s mo me nt when she 
too become s resolute. We  ate some thing and got 
dressed as if we were going out. We  put on our
 be st clothing because you never knew.  Seven 
o™clock in the evening November 20, 1942 my brot
her Maritz came to take Jackie away. What 

a mo ment. Would we ever see you again?  We  e mbr
aced you; it ha d to be .  It was for us to say 
the least the only chance. We  
had to try but how do you do some thing like that. Who gives you 
the strength to hand over your three month old ch
ild a bundle that you love so much and have 
learned every gesture in those 
three months. When we gave 
you to Uncle Maritz Zome rplaag 
we knew there would be a place pr epared for you 
in the Catholic children™s home.  Later as it 
turned out we found out it was a non-denominationa
l.  It was a Quaker house where the director 
took in various children but mostly those in Cath
olic families.  My brother Eddie found that he 
ma de more of an impres sion on us when he said it
 was a childr en™s home. I surmised this at the 
time.  It did indeed make a better impression on 
us.  Eddie said that it 
woul d still take a fe w 
days before there would be a permanent place fo
r you there.  Later we learned that those few 
days turned into a month but it was a good thing th
at we didn™t know that at the time.  In those 
four weeks of waiting you were almost a fatality.  
I will return to this la
ter.  (This is where I 
talked about that).  It™s rema rkable to me .  It 
helps to explain what I f
eel about my anxiety and 

insecurity in the world th
at as a baby I took in all this near 
destruction of stuff and from what 
we know now about children take 
in the world. It was our wish to
 survive this drama with Jack 
back with us. Therefore it was necessary to arrive at our destination safely. This wish was for 

us so strong and so consumed us that it became  
for us the strength needed to give you over to 
fulfill this unbelievable and horribl y sad task. Without exagge ration from that mo me nt on we 

thought about you every day. I would like to read 
a little bit more.  I don™
t know if there™s a–– 
 

Q: We  have mo re tape. 

 

A: Okay.  I read this to give you a sense possibly 
of what it was like for my parents and for me and 
what people lived with.  Now we
 wer e  again alone without you..What torment.  Do not think 
that it is easy to write about this now. To 
i magine that so ma ny parents had to go through the 
same  and even worse including Marie Cheel. When 
they had to take you,Andy, with the best of 
intentions of getting you back. Where your pa
rents brought you we did not know. This was 

logical since we were already underground.  Later 
I will write about some  of the details, our 
dear departed son.  My mother finished this -- 
wa s writing the story at the time my brother died 
so it changes-- what do we call 
that the transitive–..?     
 

Q: Thetense. 

 

A: The tense, the transitive chicken, I don™t know. 

 

Q: With regard to him? 

 

A: Ye s, yes. As soon as Maritz took Jackie out 
of the house we too went on our way to the Umstel 
train station just as we had planned. This t
ook ten mi nutes. We  closed the door on the largest 

part of our household™s possessi
ons and most of our clothing.  
Obviously they must not have 
had their yellow star on because 
they could not have been out.  In the meantime Dad had left a 
half-year ™s rent money behind with our landlo
rd. The landlord knew we were going away but 
not when.  If this helped us we don™t know.  It 
did give us the idea that we would say the lease 
not be looked at for six months
 although certainly not out of dispute with the landlord although 
betrayal or discovery was always naturally a pos
sibility.  In any case la ter on we heard of the 

first raid of our apartme nt and that it was sealed
 up by the Germans.Thus we were not searched 
for in the first raid.  From this we conclude 
that paying the landlord th
at way we did serve our 
purposes well.  I would like to r
ead about when my father found me .  I feel I need to have my 
voice back again. That™s the problem with this.  
My brother and I were in
strume ntal in getting 

my mother to do this and it means a lot to me a
nd I™m very pleased she did it but in reading it, it 
also pushes my button about what about me  -- now
.  Dad fel t  it was now time for hi m to begin 
his own search for you. We  are reading now a
bout the part where my parents have been 
liberated and my parents decide to look for the children, to look 
for whatever children are still 
alive. We  had no idea how to do it. We  had no guidance but our patience was up and we could 
not wait for information that would infor m 
us about what happened with you andAndy.  

Because of the behavior  of your step parents we later understood that they would not take any 

action ma king known that during the war- time they
 had hidden a child.  Many people like them 
were attached to the children in
 their care, very understandable. 
The fa mily De Chot presumed 
that Dad and I were no longer alive. We  now 
know that in our situa
tion regarding you that you 
would have then been returned to us. What
 happened during the war 
too is people did get 
attached to their children and there were many 
legal cases in Holland after the war where the 
fa milies who survived had to go to court to get the children back. The nature of some of these 

cases is very telling about Dutch ethics because after the war the way people survived was 

through the black ma rket. There was no doubt about
 it, that™s how you survived.  My mother 
feels embarrassed about it.  She thinks it™s shamef
ul.  She prefers I not saying anything about it 
but the fact is that™s how people survived.  Ge
ntile fa milies who did not want to return their 
Jewish children would often use that as an 
argument why the parents 
were not responsible 
parents and could not have the children back a
nd in ma ny cases did not 
get the children back 
because of that.  Many of the people who hid the 
children also had a religious agenda. They felt 
they needed to convert these children and it wasn™t  always a self-serving se
ntiment.  It was also 
the sentiment of how to save th
e children. To convert them woul
d be to save them, so it was 
mi xed. The reason there was a high percentage of
 Dutch Jewish children who  were able to go 
underground was because to save the people of the Book would be considered a mitzvah. The 

Jews were known as the people 
of the Book and for ma
ny of the Protestants in Holland they 
took their bible literally, it™s 
interesting. WithAndy it would 
have turned out differently 
because hi s parents were no longer 
alive. More about that later. 
 Dad didn™t want to wait any 
more while the information just dribbled in a
nd as I said went out on 
his own. After enquiring 
he found out where to go to the military authorit
ies and get a special pass that allowed him to 
hitch rides on military transport. There was no 
ot her transport at the time. You didn™t have 

buses, you didn™t have subways, you didn™t have zip. 
This meant only army vehicles. The fact 
is ther e si mp ly wasn™t  any other transport yet.  St ill this meant quite a bit. Again Dad left  the 

house with nothing but a little money for necessi
ties which themselves weren™t easy to buy.  
The military authorities gave Dad very good advice.
 The told him he must begin hi s search 
north of the rivers because Holland is in the mi
ddle divi ded by a bunch of rivers.  Because there 
was known that in the province Overeisel ther
e were children who had been bought for hiding 
so the story goes light haired ch
ildren above the rivers which wasn
™t  true of you at all. What 
Celene is talking about is that
 the people who hid children during 
the war had a policy that dark 
haired Jewish children would go to the sout
h of Holland where most of the people were 
Catholic and were darker and th
e lighter skinned, light
er haired Jewish people would go to the 
north because there were Protestants who were li
ghter.  So Dad began with the purpose in front 
of his eyes, good or bad from one e mpty army truc
k or another finally ending up in the city of 

Naivadol in Overeisel. We  had never heard 
of this place before.  Once in Naivadol Dad 
imme diately went to City Hall. There he spoke
 to several bureaucrats.  One of them,  Mr. 

Bucker, sent Dad on the way to Mrs. De Fries 
Andy™s foster mother on the large street in 
Naivadol. The ma n kne w that there was a young boy 
that had been hidden. When he arrived at 
Mrs. De Fries™s home Dad was allowed in and sawto his stunned surprise 
a little boy of whom 
he though thought this could well beAndy, his nephew.  He had the fami ly face and the age was 

also right.  Dad spoke with Mrs. De  Fries.  He
 explained his relationshi
p telling her his name
 

which at the mo me nt wa s unknown to her. Af
ter a while and for different reasons she 
understood that Dad was the brother of the moth
e r  of this child who she had taken over under 
her protection and who she was ve
ry fond of.  Dad was very lucky to have foundAndy.  For 
Mrs. De Fries this was not a happy day.  Dad 
could see that it would 
not be easy to getAndy 
from her but that™s a tale apart.  It got to be 
late in the day and thus Dad was invited to supper 
and slept there. The few hours that were left Da
d played withAndy. Andy sat on Dad™s lap and 
began to play with his ear lobe. This was a 
habit that Dad™s younger brotherYope one out of 
eight brothers and sisters always did as a little ki
d.  Mr. Bucker from City Hall also knew to tell 
Dad that a fe w kilome ters between Naivadol an
d the town of Chaino stood an old small far m 
where there was also a young boy brought undergr
ound.  He suggested that Dad should check 
this farm out because that in any event he left 
Mrs. De Fries and planned to return forAndy.  
She actually didn™t give Dad any 
indication that she understood that she had to be separated 
fromAndy a t  some  point in the future.  Dad depa
rted fromAndy with mi xed feelings from this 
complicated situation.  It was ear
ly in the morning when Dad continued his search for you.  He 
had to travel the long kilome ters on foot.  He ofte
n said to me  how he walked and walked and in 
the evening dead tired arrived so
me where on the side of a road in the village of Chaino.  He 
rang the bell of the farm.  It was already dark 
and about ten o™clock.  He waited for some one to 
answer the door which didn™t happe
n right away. They were peopl
e who were used to going to 
bed early and they were by then fast asleep.  Da
d kept ringing the bell and finally a ma n stuck 
his head out of the attic window
 and asked what was going on.  In
 the hope that the sound of a 
child crying was your crying Dad sc
rewed up his courage to begin a 
conversation with this ma n.  
He told the ma n who he  was and why he had co
me . They didn™t plan 
to open the door right 
away answering Dad. The child™s  parents di
ed and that™s  why we took him through the 
intervention of our pastor. At this
 point Dad asked to be let in, in
 any case.  He wanted them to 
know who he was by comparing some thing he had w
ith him.  Oh I guess from reading this I see 
that they brought me  to him that evening.  I thoug
ht that he slept over.  Dad was allowe d in and 
right away showed the ma n a lamb™s wool baby sh
irt because a similar one had been left with 
the baby boy when he was sent underground. This 
was from the lamb™s w
ool bathing suit that 
they had ma de. The organization that provided 
contact with underground 
hiding places had told 
the family to save it in case the child had to
 be brought to anot her pl ace.  Luckily in your 
situation this advice was heeded. After compar
ing the two pieces this was evidence enough that 
the truth was being spoken here.  Only then
 did they bring you forth, a crying young boy of 
about two years old.  Dad saw in 
the blink of an eye that it was 
his son. What a mo ment it must 
have been.  It was and is to value how these pe
ople didn™t clam up but in one night we re ma de 
100% certain before believing some thing of the pa
rental bond that was bei
ng talked about here.  
This is understandable.  Here I could write some  
things but that I won™t 
and don™t want to.  I™ll 
leave that to imagination. The truth is I don™t 
know what she™s talking about here and I™d really 
be curious. What Dad told me  about this afte
r he took you in his arms
 that is not to be 
described except by Dad himself.  
And so that was the fi rst contact for Dad with the family who 
played a large role in your and our lives. Af
ter an emotional discussion Dad was allowed to 

sleep there overnight. You and the family sl
ept upstairs while Dad was given a hay ma ttress 
and a small room downstairs.  From everythi
ng that Dad could see these people were very 

simple far mers, in fact poor people w
ho notwithstanding the poverty knew how to hold 
themselves together. The fa mily consisted of a 
sixty five year old ma n 
who looked like he was 
eighty.  His wife who was also in
 her sixties wore a wig which was 
very unusual in those years.  
They had an unma
rried son who was about twenty
 eight years old who could be mi staken for 
forty and an unma rried young daughter. When I s a
w them later I could see that they were a 
very stiff but decent people. When she says st
iff she means that they were Dutch Reformed, 
very conservative. The people were as good for 
you as they could be because with them there 

was also great hunger which was readily apparent. 
They had one horse and a few chickens left 
over. The woman told Dad that her man still had to work on the land for other farmers.  For this 
he would every day get a plate of oatmeal andonce in a while an egg. You Jack, would sit by 

him and he would share his oatm
eal and egg with you.  Mrs. De 
Chot told how she took apart 
one of her bedspreads and used the thread to ma
ke a coverall for you because all of your clot hes 
were too small.  She also said she cut the tips 
of your shoes off so that they would still fit. 
(Laughter) Re ma rkable. You know I haven™t read this
 in a few years. This can be seen from a 
photo that she ma de of you, her son and herself.  
When I look at the photo and when I had first 
seen it I had the impression that she had ma de 
this coverall for the occasion of the photograph 
for which she derived great pleasure.  I™ve neve
r seen this photo.  No
t knowing that she would 
have to give you up.  Later at our first meeting 
she said that she never would have given you up 
had it not been your real parent
s who claime d you.  She had planned to have you baptized but 
our appearance had prevented this. Too bad I w
ould have been covered there too. There was no 
doubt at all that these people were
 very fond of you and the son pl
ayed the role of father even 
more so than the older ma n. This became quite
 clear later on. The fami ly came  out of a 
Refor m Protestant background. They
 were very for mal and lived ju
st like Mrs. De Fries with 
her bible on the table. Almost everybody in Overei
sel lived like this.  I 
just want to interrupt 
this reading by saying some thing th
at I have found out in the last 
half a year that there was in 
fact a group in Holland, there was a gr
oup of young people, 17, 18, 19, 20 who were 
instrume ntal in providing hiding places for Je
wish children like myself and this group was 
called the NV which literally translated means the unknown holding company, the anonymous 

holding company which is a wonderful surrealistic 
title I think. And my 
cousin Ya nika from 
California has been receiving this information a
nd recently sent me an article about an older 
ma n who is very pivotal in this
 group who was captured and killed
 and in the article there is a 
list of children™s name s of their name , the date 
they were born and where they were hidden and 
my na me  is in there and I saw it and it was a re
markable experience to get this.  I called my 
cousinYa nika and I said to her 
I got this, this is w
onderful. And she says to me  what did you 
feel like when you saw your name ?   
And I said well the truth is I fe
lt wonderful.  It confirms  all 
these things and I said and how 
did you feel and she said well I 
wept and I wept and I wept.  
She is 57 so she™s older than me  and she re
me mb ers our grandparents.  She reme mbe r s going 
out every day when she was hidden underground wa
iting for her parents to come  back so she 
has that expe rience.  But for me  it was a rema rkable experience to see my name  Isaac 
Tr ompettor and then Overeisel which is the pr ov
ince where I was and then a question ma rk next 
to Overeisel that ma y me an we don™t know where 
in Overeisel.  It was a stunning experience 
for me to see that and it was all the result of me 
spending the last years of
 searching this out.  I 
know my pa rents were very resistant to that fo
r a long time and I feel very vindicated that I 
pursued this and stayed with it, th
at I got this.  It™s very import
ant to me.  I would emphatically 
encourage other people who have similar or like 
stories to do that. Whe n you do find out real 
documented pieces of what you™ve always heard in
 your fami ly it™s emotionally very fulfilling 
and powerful. 
 

Q: I imagine.  Do you want to choose ma ybe one or two more things to read. 

 

A? Sure.  I™ll just read this last
 page.  In the few days that it wa
s necessary for Dad to stay there, 
there was so much conversation from which Dad 
had heard that in the 
beginning there was also 
another young boy about twelve years old who they 
also hid.  Mrs. De Chot had noticed that 
when she was away and came home  to you, you 
were crying and the young boy had frightened 
you and the crying got worse instead 
of better.  It turn
ed out that he woul
d light the stove and 
put me  head first into the stove
, this boy.  I™d rather not belie
ve it but it was enough for them to 

bring this boy some where else because they wanted to keep you.  So I can imagine seeing this 
other young Jewish kid who was 
out of his mi nd and took it out on me .  He had to go 
some where else and who knows what happened to th
is boy. I think this accounts for some  of my 
having a nervous breakdown after the war, being 
fricasseed.  Now it was time for Dad to figure 
out how to come  home .  He knew that I didn™
t know what was going on nor did he have an 
opportunity to inform me. You know there were
 no phones then that were working. The next 
morning Dad went to the church, spoke with the pastor. Wh at Dad told him was sufficient 

enough for Dad to take you without
 any official authorization. 
The church had a lot of 
influence with people. You could go to the ch
urch and ma ke it clear to them you were the 

parent and the church would go to the people and 
talk to them and convince them.  From there 
we went to the local military authority who provided him with a transpor tation pass so that 

when transport went south both of 
you could go on it.  It took four 
That's_my_Mom.jpgThat's_my_Mom.jpgdays before
 an empty truck came  your wa y. Those 
four days were actually very 
necessary because you two got to know each other. The morning 
when the truck arrived Da d and you left forTilburg promising the De Chots to keep in touch 

and he would let them know how 
you were doing.  Naturally we 
kept our word. We  did. We  
were in touch and visited those people up until we 
went toAmerica.  It was also the time at least 
according to my parents that they got to be 
very pushy and obnoxious about wanting to convert 
me .  I suspect that this was not entirely so and 
ma ybe what my parents ha
d to flush out in order 
to ma ke the necessary separation from these peop
le.  I mean it™s complex and subtle stuff with 
this last little chapter. What 
Dad clearly reme mbers about this tr
ip was that as long as the ride 
took, you sat in your wet pants on his lap and he go
t wet, too. You also cried often during the 
trip.  How could it be otherwise sitting in the 
back for hours with the f
eeling of wet pants, no 
food or drink, as well as the crowding of
 ma ny other people around you. While you possibly 
had been so used to the quiet 
all of a sudden such a huge chan
ge.  I have often thought about 
this especially if I had been th
e one to carry you instead of Dad.  
I have also often thought about 
how I would have felt if I had been the one to se
e you first at the De Chots. To understand that 
I could see you in front of me  to spoil you and 
take you with me . What would that have felt 
like?  This will always be a question. The othe
r question that should al
ways be a question and 
unfortunately didn™t get addresse
d in our fa mily was what was it like for me  to be adopted by 
my parents. Powerful stuff. 
 

Q: Indeed, well I thank you again.
