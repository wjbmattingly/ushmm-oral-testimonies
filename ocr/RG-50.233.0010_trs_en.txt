ID Project Interview 
with George Brieger 
March 25, 1992 
New York, New York  

 

 

Q: Today is March 25, 1992.  I am Anthony Di Iorio of the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum.  I a m in the home  of Mr. George Brieger, New York City and 

I™m here on behalf of the US Holocaust Museum to interview George about the 

experience of his father and uncle dur
ing the Holocaust in Hungary.  Good 
evening George.   
 

A: Hi, how are you.  My father Anno Briege r was born in Nyathalas near Hungary 
on 1925.  He lived most of his childhood in Nyireghaza which was the city of the 

region, the bigger city.  Although his grandm
other, that™s his father™s mother 
lived, continued to live there, in Nyathalas.  They would some ti me s take 

vacations there.  And the distance betw
een the two cities was about, I don™t know, 
a couple of miles but to get 
from Nyireghaza toNyathala
s is a big trip and it took 
half a day on horse and buggy.  And it woul
d be a big deal when all the kids 

would get to go on the carriages.  
 

Q: And that™s how everybody traveled in those days, horse and buggy? 

 

A: Right.  And my father™s grandmothe
r was a renown baker in Nyathalas and 
everyone called her Toni, Jews and gentiles alike 
 

Q: What was her name? 
 
A: Toni. 

 

Q: Toni.  You know what her last name  was?
  This would be your father™s mother™s 
mother.  Father™s mother. 
 

A: So I don™t -- let™s see.  It ma y have be
en -- I know that she was a descendent of a 
great Rabbi thirteen generations before
, whose name  was Aschach Rabbi™s name  
thirteen generations back and they were Cohanites. 
 

Q: This is a very religious fa mily. 

 

A: Yes, quite religious. 

 

Q: And your father™s family, your father™s mother and fa mily? 

 

A: They were quite orthodox.  In fact my 
father™s father, my grandfather, was very 
instrume ntal in the synagogues there,
 orthodox synagogues, there were three 
synagogues, two synagogues in Nyireghaza, the orthodox and the -- something 

called status quo, sort of like conservativ
e, this conservative synagogue was the 

 
 
2
bigger one in terms of numbers of peopl
e.  And my father attended the school 
attached to the orthodox synagogue when he
 was young, then later, when he was I 
guess elementary, mi ddle school he attended 
the larger Jewish school there in the 
morning.  And in the afternoon he attende
d Yeshiva in the or attached to the 
orthodox synagogue in Nyireghaza.  And he 
would tell me that they used to -- 
they would get into fights with the ge
ntile children on the way home .  There 
would be a whole thing where they would --  
 
Q: Yourfatherand– 

 

A: My father and his classmates from Jewi
sh school would be attacked by the gentile 
children on their way home  and it would be
 a big deal how to get home without 
getting into a fight. 
 

Q: These fights were quite common?  

 

A: It seemed that it happened from time to time. 

 

Q: Did anyone ever get hurt? 

 

A: I don™t think, not that my  father told 
me  so I guess they couldn™t have been too 
serious at least for my father and hi s im
me diate friends.  And he was, my father 
was actually a very good student in, especia
lly in the Yeshiva and he was, he gave 
a big speech on his barmirzvah in the s
ynagogue and he went to the Yeshiva in 
Munkatch which is now part of Ru
ssia.  It™s part of that --- 
 
Q: Right, the Ukraine. 
 

A: Right, the Ukraine, sorry. 

 

Q: So he actually left home Œ 

\ 

A: Left home  when he was thirteen at 
the barmitzvah and he went and attended 
Yeshiva in Munkatch and he excelled, he was one of the top guys in the ---, 

according to the Rabbi.  He sat next to th
e Rabbi in the Sabbath for the meals and 
that was like the big deal and he™d te
ll me  the stories about the ____.  The 
Yeshiva didn™t have dormitories.  They would have private Jewish fa milies they 

would put them up with and the people w
ho could afford it were supposed to give 
some  money, some  money to these fa
milies because you know to support them, 
cause they would give them two meal
s a day, these families would.  And his 
fa mily was pretty well off.  My grandfathe
r was pretty well off.  They ha d an iron 

store, a hardware store. 
 

Q: So your father™s father had an iron– 

 

A: A hardware, hardware store. 

 
 
3
 
Q: Hardwarestore. 

 

A: And it was pretty lucrative.  He was 
one of the better off people in the Jewish 
community. 
 

Q: What was your grandfather™s name? 

 

A: Brieger. 

 

Q: No, the first name. 

 

A: Adolph, believe it or not. 

 

Q: Adolph. And his wife would be T
oni or would that have been ---? 
 

A: No that would be, his mother, his mother. 

 

Q: So Adolph™s mother was Toni? 

 

A: Right, right.  Adolph™s wi
fe, my father™s mother died in childbirth, on her third 
child. 
 

Q: So your father™s mother died – 

 

A: My father™s mother died during child
birth on her -- I™m not sure which child it 
was -- it ma y have been the third or the fi
fth.  There were six siblings altogether 
including my father eventually but th
e last one was from the second wife. 
 

Q: So Adolph rema rried and had one more– 

 

A: One more child, yes. 

 

Q: That would be the sixth. 

 

A: The sixth, yeah. 

 

Q: So your father had four brothers  and sisters and one half-brother? 

 

A: Yes, I believe so.  One of them was a si
ster, all the other ones were brothers.  I™m 
not sure if the sister was th
e one that was half or not. 
 

Q: So a total of six -- one girl, five boys. 

 

A: Yeah, my fa ther being the oldest.  My 
father™s mother, natural mother™s maiden 
name was Deutsch. 

 
 
4
 
Q: Adolph™s first wife™s ma iden name  
was Deutsch.  But you don™t remember  her 
fi rst  name?  
 

A: No.  They were also from the Munka
tch area, maybe not Munkatch proper but 
that area. 
 

Q: NearMatermush? 

 

A: No, I think that™s south.  
Munkatch is toward the east. 
 

Q: Okay, as I reme mber looking at one of
 the photos, Grandfather Deutsch lived in 
Transylvania. 
 

A: Right, that™s my mother™s.  That™s my mo
ther™s family.  I think it™s a coincidence. 
 

Q: So there™s two Deutsch™s in your family? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Okay.  Now I™m beginning to follow.  Your
 father™s father™s fi rst wife was name d 
Deutsch and there™s also 
a Deutsch on your mother™s side of the fa mily. 
 

A: Right.  My mother is De utsch, ma iden name . 

 

Q: Okay.  So your father™s fa mily was re
latively well off and could afford to send 
him to Munkatch and help pay– 
 

A: Right and he got packages from time to 
time with preserves or what have you.  I 
don™t know stuff like that, that was the big 
deal and he would some times give to 
the more needy children, you know give them a sandwich or whatever cause some  

of them, the ones that were poor were real
ly poor.  Like my father in his youth 
had two shoes, one for weekday and one for the Sabbath.  That was a big deal 

because the poor children had just one pa
ir of shoes for the Sa bbath and during 

the weekday they would just go barefoot
.  You know we™re talking poverty here. 
 

Q; Yeah, how long was your father in Munkatch? 

 

A: He was there until he was about sevent
een or eighteen although I think there ma y 
have been some other Yeshiva in there as
 well, some  other towns but I think he 
was away for a total of 
four or five years. 
 

Q: Now the time that he  was going there th
is territory passed fro
m Czechoslovakia to 
Hungary.  Did he tell any stories about the 
Hungarians taking ove
r?   Now he was, 
of course. A Hungarian citizen. 
 

 
 
5
A: Right. 
 

Q: This territory was separated from Hunga
ry at the end of Wo
rld War I and then 
taken back right around the time that your 
father went up there.  Now you™re not 
aware of any connection between his goi
ng to Munkatch (he would have been 
over thirteen years of age) that would 
be late 1938, early 1939 which is when the 
Hungarians ma rch in. 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: And he™s there for how ma ny years? 

 

A: Four or five. 

 

Q: Four or five years.  So 
he™s separated from the rest of
 the fa mily for quite a while. 
 

A: Well, he would visit obviously and stuff. 

 

Q: Yeah, but I mean he™s living apart. 

 

A: Yeah, although he did tell me  that th
e people in the area spoke ma ny languages.  
My father didn™t speak Czech, did not.  
But many of the, like for example, the 
typical Jew would speak Yiddish, Hunga
rian, because that wa s the dominant 
culture so to speak.  And th
en either Ukrainian or Czech.  And of course he would 
read Hebrew because that was the prayer language. 
 
Q: So your father™s family, going back ho
me  now, when they were growing up, were 
they speaking both Yiddish and Hungarian? 
 
A: Yes but they would speak Hungarian inthe house.  That was their first language. 

 

Q: Hungarian speaking but they all knew Yiddish. 

 

A: They all knew Yiddish fluently, like a mo
ther tongue.  And they read Hebrew and 
they studied in Hebrew. 
 

Q: Yourfatherdid. 

 

A: Yes, and so did all the other children. 

 

Q: But he especially in the Yesh
iva training.  Any other languages/ 
 

A: Well later on he studied German.  What 
happened was, I™m not sure what year but 
I think he was around seventeen and eightee
n he came back and they thought he 
should learn a trade because 
they thought that trouble was comi ng and they knew 
that the hardware store is going to be
 taken away or some thing, not by the 

 
 
6
Germans because there weren™t Germans ye
t, but just the rise of anti-Semitism 
and the Kolneilash. 
 
Q: The Arrow Cross 

 

A: The Arrow Cross, right. 

 

Q: The Hungarian fascis
ts.  Hungarian Nazis. 
 

A: So he learned to be a tailor and he 
also learned German because that was the 
lingua franca of the area. 
 

Q: So he started to study Ge rman and tailoring. 

 

A: Right, sort of like vocational school. 

 

Q: Did he actually go to a formal school? 

 

A: This is a school, a school he went to in Hungary 

 

Q: You don™t know which–? 

 

A: I don™t know where. 

 

Q: This would have been when he was about eighteen you say. 

 
A: Yeah.  I know that he was very excelled in German, in language and the 
Hungarian German teacher never gave him 
(one was the best grade, sort of like 
the A.  Grades from one to five, 
one being the highest, five being the 
lowest)–and he would never get a one, 
he would only got a two.  And one time 
he asked her how come  I don™t get a one I 
did the best paper in the class?   She 
said to Jews I don™t give ones. 
 
Q: Now originally did anyone plan on hi
m becomi ng a Rabbi considering all the 
studying that he was– 
 

A: He was sort of being groome d for some  
sort of professional role or ma ybe taking 
over the hardware store, I™m not sure but 
it was clear that he was going to be the 
studier of the fa mily.  But I don™t th
ink a Rabbi as such was considered. 
 

Q: Now Adolph, did he lo
se the hardware store? 

 

A: Well, yes, sure the Nazis took it away when they took power. 

 

Q: The Hungarian Nazis. 

 

 
 
7
A: Hungarian Nazis. There we
re a series of laws passed.  First there were quotas 
imposed on what Jews can and can™t do 
in terms of university admi ssions or 
ownership of property and then there were
 sort of nume rous closes which means 
they couldn™t attend universit
y at all; they couldn™t ha
ve any property other than 
personal property.  So they were taken away and there was a ghetto created in 
Nyireghaza and then– 
 

Q: But not in Na jhalaas. 

 

A: I don™t know about Najhalaas. 

 

Q: It would be too small probably but 
there™s a ghetto in 1944 in Nyireghaza. 
 

A: I don™t know if it™s 1944 but 
it™s some  ti me  in there. 
 

Q: Yourfatherha
s returned by then? 
 

A; Oh, yeah, yeah, he was already back 
because when the trouble started he moved 
back home. 
 

Q: So he leaves Munkatch, he studies at
 a vocational school somewhere in Hungary 
and then he leaves that 
school to come back home. 
 

A: Well I think that school 
was home  or near home already, the vocational school 
was. 
 
Q: Okay, so the fa mily is together? 
 

A: The fa mily is together, right. 

 

Q: Including your uncle Julah? 

 

A: Yes, yes. My grandfather was very big 
on the family being together in the time of 
crisis and you™ll see that later on also. 
 

Q; What was your uncle Julah doing there 
in these years before we go ahead? 
 

A: I don™t know. 

 

Q: You don™t know whether he was going 
to school or planning on a trade? 
 

A: I don™t know. 

 

Q: No, Okay, so back to the ghetto. 

 

 
 
8
A: Right.  The ghetto was in the area that my
 father lived in because my father lived 
in the Jewish community area where all th
e other Jews lived so I don™t think they 
had to move  but they did have other people moving in with them.  The pe ople 
from not just Nyireghaza but the wholearea because Nyireghaza was sort of the 

local capital there. 
 

Q: Even Nadjhalaas pe rhaps? 

 

A: Perhaps -- from the villages were bro
ught in and they were shoved into the ghetto 
including my father™s house.  My fa
ther™s house was relatively comfortable 
because again they were pretty well off.  And they were moved in there and it was 

pretty uncomfortable because there we
re many people per room.  There were 
several fami lies living in one
 room.  And then I think the last year 1944 is when 
the deportation started so a
ll the Jews began to be r
ounded up and they were put 
on the cattle cars.  They were
n™t told where they™re going. 
 

Q: By Hungarians or by Germans?  

 

A: I think it was mostly Hungarians.  Th
e Germans didn™t have the ma npower to do 
all this stuff.  What they had to do was:
 fi rst they had to take all their personal 

belongings and ma il it to this address that wa
s given to them.  They were told that 
thats™s where they™re going to this camp.  
It™s a Hungarian address.  So they had 
to package everythi ng and ma
iled everything to this camp. 
 

Q: To a Hungarian address to an assume d destination.  This was their assume d 
destination. 
 

A: Assume d destination.  My father said th
at the address was a phony address.  They 
never really read the addr ess.  It was ju
st put on a thing a
nd it was all taken and 
used by the Nazis or whatever. 
 

Q: Did he know that at the time? 

 

A: No, of course not. 

 

Q: So they actually ma iled -- the entire 
family, your father, his father, everyone 
sent– 
 

A: Whatever possessions they had -- clothing or 
whatever had to be sent to this stuff.  
They also buried, illegally of course, burie
d some  stuff.  One  of the things that 

were buried was my father™s so
rt of tools of the trade, his sewi ng kit, his threads, 
because threads were ---apparently threads 
were very hard to come by because the 
economy, everything was geared toward th
e war so civilians
 couldn™t come  by 
thread -- you know spools of thread I™m ta
lking about --` so my father took like a 
box of thread, different colors, needles 
and what have you and buried it under the 
chicken coop. 

 
 
9
 
Q: Did he actually have
 a sewing machine?  
 

A: I don™t think do. 

 

Q: So they had some  notice.  When they 
were told before they™r e actually deported 
they were given what?   A couple of days or more? 
 

A: I don™t know how long it was. 

 

Q: Did all this happen, ma il and everything? 

 

A: No, it had to be more than one day.  It must have been a couple of weeks, I guess.  
They were told they were being relocate
d.  They weren™t told they were being 
shipped off to north.  They were just 
told they™re going to a different area. 
 

Q: So they were burying things because they
 didn™t want to give them up, so they 
couldn™t carry them and they were
 hoping to return some  day? 
 

A: Right, right, right.  And of
 course I guess they believed
 the st ory that they were 
being fed but they all had doubts also.  Th
ey certainly didn™t trust the Hungarian 
Nazis.  And so right, like you said they
 had hopes of comi ng back one day and 
digging up stuff. 
 

A: Did your family ever tell you what hi
s father and mother and other family 
me mbers were thinking or saying duri
ng these days?   Anybody doing anything 
that stands out in your mi nd besides bur
ying things?   Did an
yone try to hide, 
anyone try to get away? 
 

A: Actually I think that  there was some sort
 of paper that my father acquired.  I think 
it was my fa ther who acquired it.  So me body 
in the family acquired it, some sort 
of forged paper that said that he wa
s Hungarian, not Jewish
 which would have 

allowed him to leave the ghetto and move 
away.  But my grandfather wanted the 

fa mily to stick together.  He felt the best
 chance of getting thr
ough this wa s just to 
stick together.  So they gave the paper 
to I think a cousin.  Actually it was a 
passport, a Hungarian passport.  They gave 
it to my cousin.  Actually this cousin 
is still alive today.  I™ll get 
back to him after the war. 
 

Q: Okay.  That™s not Frank, is it? 

 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: So your father actually had a passport 
which he could have used but his father 
Adolph persuaded him to give it to his cousin? 
 

A: Right. 

 
 
10
 
Q: The person who survived, did he survive because  of the passport? 

 

A: I guess partly.  He wasn™t deported so to that extent he was spared a whole -- he 
sort of increased his chances of surv
ival.  We  know it™s just a question of 
increasing your chances.  You couldn™t be
 really certain that you would survive 
one way or the other. 
 

Q: Did your father and his fa mily realize at th
is point that their lives were in fact in 
danger?  
 

A: I don™t think they understood 
the ma gnitude of the danger. 
 

Q: They were thinking of their property being stolen, being relocat
ed and so forth but 
did anyone suspect that whole villages
, whole communities would in fact be 
killed? 
 

A: I don™t think so.  The whole death camp 
was certainly nothing that was known to 
them. 
 

Q: Did anyone hear anything about ma ssacres
 that had taken place before either in 
Russia or in Poland by word of mouth, did 
anyone hear of Hunga
rian soldiers in 
Russia returning? 
 

A: I don™t think so.  I think that there were
 some  sort of prophets of doom that would 
come  by, Ja wotinski I think 
 

Q: He had died 

 

A: He had died but earlier had come  and wa
rned people but he didn™t have first-hand 
information. 
 

Q: No, I™m talking about ™42, ™43, ™44.  
You know people are being killed by the 
millions in Russia, in Poland.  They™re Hungarian soldiers in Russia.  There are 

Hungarian Jews who we re being sent to wo
rk forced labor in Russia.  No one was 
comi ng back and telling stories? 
 

A: I don™t think so, not 
that my father knew. 
 

Q: So we got your father™s fa m
ily getting ready for resettleme nt. 
 

A: Resettleme nt, right.  So finally they we
re getting on the train and the one story he 
told me  that there was this old couple 
who had this jar of honey with them.  
Honey was something valuable because it la
st ed, it didn™t spoil and so that was 
some thing that they coul d take with them
.  On the process of getting on the train 
they dropped the jar and the jar spilled 
and all the honey was spilling on the floor 

 
 
11
and so my father described how eager th
ey were just to scoop it up, what was 
there to scoop it up with thei
r hands and just put it back
 and put the honey back in 
the jar and how futile the attempt was because the honey would be taken away 
only a few hours later. 
 

Q: But nobody knew. 

 

A: But nobody knew that. 

 

Q: Did they have any food?   First of all 
the whole family got on the train together 
still? 
 

A: I know my mother who wife was -- certa
inly the three of them, my father, my 
father™s brother Jussi by his father. 
 

Q: So Adolph, Yena and Jussi. 

 

A: Right, and also my grandmother, that
™s Adolph™s wife and also her baby, the 
youngest kid because she was just a baby then. 
 

Q: Did they have any food with them?   Di
d he ever tell you what it was like getting 
into this train?  First of all did they 
know it was going to be a cattle car until they 

actually saw it? 
 

A: I don™t think they knew anything.  They we
re just given orders
.  The cattle car -- 
there™s barely enough room to stand in 
the cattle car.  You didn™t have enough 
room for packages. 
 

Q: You had said they ma iled their belongings already 

 

A: Right.  They had already ma iled. 

 

Q: So did they have anything with them?   Food? 

 

A: I don™t think they had any food with them, no. 

 

Q: Just get into this car, no food, no belongi
ngs.  Wh at was it like being in there?   
Had he ever described the inside of this? 
 

A: I™m not sure about this particular jour
ney but late on in cattle cars in general it 
was very crowded.  One particular time,
 I™ m skipping ahead a few months , but 
they were being shipped from one place to th
e othe r in cattle cars after they were 
in––– 
 

Q: ToAuschwitz. 

 

 
 
12
A: All the prisoners had a little sort of li
ke a cup, like a me tal cup and this cup was 
used for everything from getting the soup ra
tions to getting any 
water if you could 
find some  and also in the cattle cars on th
is particular journe
y they were on for 
several days at a time  there was no room
 to go to the bathroom.  So what the 
prisoners would do is they w
ould -- the ones that weren™t 
standing near the side -- 
they would sort of use this cup and then just get rid of it. 
 
Q: Use it as a portable toilet. 

 

A: Portable toilet, right. 

 

Q: And then throw it out of the cattle car?  

 

A: Throw it out or even in the cattle
 car, just get rid of it some how. 
 

Q: The first trip from Hunga ry to Auschwitz come s as a shock.  No one could 
imagine this condition.  You have no toilet, no food, no belongings.  How long 

did that  trip take? 
 

A: I don™t know.  I don™t know how long the trip wa s. 

 

Q: He never did tell you what it is like 
being in that -- tell you what people were 
saying?   Here he is with his mother, hi
s father, couple of br
others not knowing 
where they™re going to end up -- any stories 
about what they were thinking, what 
they were saying? 
 
A: No, not that I can reme mber.  The an
ticipation -- I don™t have any informa tion 
about that. 
 
Q: And with nothing to drink, nothing to eat. 

 

A: Nothing to drink.  So they finally got 
to Auschwitz or the first camp.  I think it 
was Auschwitz, sort of like 
the big camp that everyone so
rt of checked in through.  
And they got off the cattle cars and they saw these Polish Jews  who were inma tes 

or prisoners, I don™t know what
 to call them with the unifo
rms, with the stripes.  
These guys would sort of have a few whis
pers as they walked by because they 
weren™t allowed to talk to each other but
 the Polish prisoners who were there for 
years because the Poles had to go to the 
camps before -- would tell them about -- 
they would say things like, ma ke believe you™re healthy because that way you 

would be steered toward, what was it, the 
right as opposed to the left or whatever 

it was, whatever their options were.  The 
other reason that if they ma de be lieve 
that they™re sick then they wouldn™t have 
to work hard or some thing.  They would 
go to the hospital or some thing.  That 
was counter-intuitive to ma ke the–.  
 

Q: That™s right, you don™t assume  that because
 you™re sick you™re going to be  killed.  
Any other suggestions they were getting?
  Make believe you™re healthy and of 

 
 
13
course how healthy can you be after the tr
ain ride like the one you just described.  
Any others?   How about age?  
 Did they talk about age? 
 
A: They didn™t have a lot of time to talk obviously. 

 

Q: Whataboutchildren? 

 

A: There™s nothing to do about children 
I suppose.  But the Hungarian Jews, they 
communicated in Yiddish, thought that th
e ??? was arranged, that these people in 
the camps because there are some  mental pr oblems because after years in the 

camp they were so dehuma nized and the 
rema rks were so outlandish that they 

thought there was some t hing wrong here. 
 

Q: There was.  That™s an interesting obser
vation.  Here they™re getting tips, what we 
would call tips, right?  Helpful hints -- and 
yet as they hear this it™s so diffi cult to 
believe that  they actually suspect that
 the me ssengers are deranged, crazy.  And 
yet what else did they see when they got
 there?   Were these people deranged?   
What did your father see when
 he got out of that car? 
 

A: He saw the si gn that ﬁWork Makes Y
ou Freeﬂ and he saw there was a building 
that you went into to strip and get rid 
of all the clothing.  They gave you the 
prison clothing. 
 

Q: He didn™t see any dead people? 

 

A: No, this is up front.  The cattle cars co
me  in.  It looks like a factory or some thing. 
 

Q: Well it was.  How about -- I mean thosewho™ve been there recall the smell.  Wa s 
there anything about the smell? 
 

A: I think the smell started later because at
 this point they weren™t burni ng the bodies 
yet.  That only started when they we
re running out of time, the Germans thought 
they were running out of time.  This point they still had time to bury the bodies 

after the ga s chambers.  Or at least there weren™ t as ma ny crematoria or they 

weren™t going at full speed. 
 

Q: So your father, is he separate
d from the rest of the fa mily? 
 

A: He was separated from all but the three.  
That is, my father™s 
father, my father and 
his brother -- next to the youngest brother 
-- stayed together the whole time  until 
much later.  I™ll get to that later. 
 

Q: So Adolph, Yeno are separated–  

 

A: –are together, separated from the rest. 

 

 
 
14
Q: Yeah, are separated,  -- the rest meaning the mother and the child. 
 

A: I think the rest of the children were th
ere, too.  And of course they found out a 
few days later that they were all killed 
because the children and the mother went 
straight to the gas chamber. 
 

Q: They didn™t know that until–.? 

 

A: Until much later when they got a 
feel for the rhythm of the camp. 
 

Q: Okay so together they get stripped? 

 

A: They get stripped, they get showered.  
Believe it or not they get showered, they 
get their haircuts and they have to give 
up their shoes and they get their uniforms .  
They™re tattooed I think.  Ac
tually I have a very intere
sting story about that.  My 
father™s number was A3166 and his brothe
r™s must have been A3066 were very 
close by but what I am saying is my 
birthday is April 30, 1966 so there™s 
some thing very eerie about that.  I know
 it™s just coincidence to you but to me  
there™s some thing -- well anyway– 
 

Q: They™re still together. 

 

A: They™re still together and so they go in
to the camp.  They we
re given these -- the 
fi rst meal that they got was the soup that was very thick, liquidy -- very thick 

greenish -- it was thick greenish soup th
at nobody knew what it was ma de of or 
what it was.  My father™s father, my gr
andfather and my father™s brother didn™t 
want to eat it because  it tasted horrible.  It 
di dn™t taste like food at all, it tasted like 
cooked tree leaves or some thing.  But my fa
ther said to them 
that we better eat 
them now because if we get this today we get the same thing tomorrow, it™s not 
going to be better. If we 
don™t survive we have to eat
 it.  That was the theme 
throughout.  My father was into survival.  
My fa ther said take what we get and 
you can™t be picky because you™re not going to
 survive.  And so I guess they ate it 
or they forced themselves to eat it.  And that was it.  Every day they got a bowl of 

soup, this thick greenish soup and not 
much else.  Once in a while in the 
beginning -- things got progressively worse 
as it went on -- in the beginning they 
also got bread in the beginning, some times. 
 

Q: When did they arrive in 
Auschwitz, did he ever tell you? 

 

A: I guess it was some ti me  in ™44. 
 It was the fall of ™44, I think. 
 

Q: Orspring. 

 

A: The spring, that could have been it. 
 He was there for a year, all the camps. 
 

 
 
15
Q: Altogether a year because the war endsin the spring of ™45 so the spring of ™44 
one year. 
 
A: Right,right. 

 

Q: How long was he in Auschwitz? 

 

A: I don™t know -- a couple of months, ma ybe
 several months.  I don™t know exactly 
how long.  I can™t name  the camps that he was in.  I know he was in Auschwitz; I 

know he was in Bergen-Belsen.  I don™t 
have all the camps off-hand or how long 
he was in each.  Jussi, my father™s 
youngest brother was 
very good at getting 
things.  My father described that one tim
e they would -- the truck with the bread 
would come  by and they would load the 
bread into the kitchen and the way it 
would work is that the guy on the truck 
would throw the bread -- like big 3 kilo 
loaves of bread -- to th
e guy by the kitchen.  He w
ould catch it and he would 
just–.And so my father™s brother Jussi 
was very quick.  He snuck up underneath 
the truck -- again this wa s all the begi
nning when there was still so much food --
he snuck up underneath the truck and between
 like sort of the truck and the place 
where the other guy stood and as the guy pi
cked up the bread to throw it.  The guy 
threw it; imme diately turned back to pi
ck up the next piece 
and the other guy was 
still sort of still bending 
up from the previous throw and so he jumped up and 
caught it and he went back underneath th
e truck and he ran li
ke hell because if 
you get caught for that that™s shot on sight. 
 

Q: Orhanged. 

 
A: Orhanged. 
 

Q: So he could steal bread. 

 

A: He could steal bread.  This is very ri
sky.  It™s the sort of thing you risk it– 
 

Q: I know and it™s very hard to
 hide a 3 kilo loaf of bread. 
 

A: What they do was they went to the ba
throom and they ate two thirds of it right 
away and they saved one third of it for my
 grandfather.  The idea was to hide the 
evidence and eating quickly.  There are 
two reasons why you have to eat it 
quickly.  Number one you have to hide th
e evidence.  Number two things always 
get either stolen or lost or
 if you work hard it gets dama ged or stolen.  Prisoners 
would steal whatever they can
 get their hands on.  So 
my fat her™s fat her sai d 
always whatever you get in rations eat it ri
ght away.  Don™t try to save it or ration 
whatever for yourself. 
 

Q: It sounds like your father and your uncl
e found it difficult to tr
ust other prisoners. 
 

 
 
16
A: Yeah, there™s another little story th
at bears on that poi nt.  It™s a very 
dehumanizing experience and you got to th
e point where you care about your own 
personal survival and nothing else. 
 
Q: Not someone else™s survival? 

 

A: Not someone else™s survival.  The thr
ee of them were toge
ther.  That was an 
exception but other than that– 
 

Q: So it™s the three musketeers–.. 

 

A: Againsttheworld. 

 

Q: Against the world and other pr
isoners are part of the world. 
 

A: Right,right. 

 

Q: Were there other people from
 your father™s town with him?  
 

A: Occasionally they would have people fr
om that town but as the time went by 
people would either drop dead or they w
ould be dispersed so there were less and 
less people that he knew personally.  Occas
ionally he would bump into people he 

thought he knew.  One time he was walk
ing by near the perime ter of the camp 
and there were these guard towers.  And the guard yelled down at him in 

Hungarian because a Hungarian Nazi and he looked up, you know pleasantly 

surprised and he threw down, the guard threw down a piece of bread.  So he 
figured wow, Hungarian, there™s some people 
love me  up there.  He tore the piece 
of bread apart and the bread 
was full of little needles, 
little you know the kind of 
needles you have in your shirt when it™s new. 
 
Q: Pins. 

 

A: Little pins. So if he would have bit in
to it he could have dama ged his mouth.  So 
much for the Hungarian Nazis.  Another 
story was that my father, Jussi again 
stole beets.  And that 
was another hot commodity. 
 

Q: He™s developing a pattern here.  St
ole beets.  Where did he find beets? 
 

A: Near the kitchen.  They would sneak 
into the kitchen.  Again these were all 
capital crimes.  The three of them at e so
 many beets that for 
days their stool was 
red.  That™s all they ate wa
s beets.  Another story about
 my uncle Jussi -- this I 
think is later.  One of the camps -- they  were building some thing.  I think it was a 

glass factor y that was being built.  This was toward the end of the thing so I™m 

skipping ahead a few mo nths because the allies would bomb it.  They had the 

three shifts -- the Americans during 
the day and the Russians at night. 
 

 
 
17
Q: The British at night. 
 

A: The British at night, right.  So the 
factory was being built; they never finished 
because whatever they built is knocke d down by the bombers.  They kept 

bombing this thing 
 

Q: This was you say near Be rgen-Belsen? 

 

A: I don™t know. 

 

Q: OrDora? 

 

A: Dora is one of the things, one of the cam
ps.  It may have been Dora.  I know Dora 
was one of the camps my father was in.  
and so there was a little wheelbarrow that 
the prisoner has to push up on th
is little wooden plank at an 
angle.  So they had to 
sort of run up to get enough mo me ntum 
to get the wheelbarrow full of ceme nt up 
on the plank and they would only fill the wheelbarrow half way up because you 

couldn™t get enough mo mentum to push it 
all the way up the steep little plank.  
And so the Kapo who was a prisoner who turned, became one of them, especially 

picked out bully types, came  by and he
 said how come  you™re only filling the 

wheelbarrow half way because you get mo
re productive if you fill it fully so one 
of the prisoners explained th
at we can™t because we can
™t push it up the plank that 
way.  So he said let me  try.  
So he had the thing filled up. 
 

Q: TheKapo? 

 
A: He personally had his own wheelbarrow filled up and he– 
 

Q: You™re talking about the Kapo? 

 

A: The Kapo, right and he tried to push it 
up.  He couldn™t because it was too heavy.  
And bear in mi nd that the Kapo was in 
better shape than 
the other prisoners 
because he got more rations.  And so he
 got steami ng ma d.  He was very upset 

because not only was he s
hown wrong but he was also– 
 

Q: Shownwea k. 

 

A: Shown wea k, right.  And so Jussi load
ed the thing completely, the wheelbarrow 
completely and he went up -- just  then he went up and he succeeded in going up 

the plank. 
 

Q: Jussi? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: The same  one that the Kapo couldn™t push? 

 
 
18
 
A: The same  one that the Kapo couldn™t pus
h.  So the Kapo was very pleased.  He 
gave him extra rations that day.  So these we
re little tricks that  kept them alive.  

There was one particularly long journey that
 they had to go on.  They had to keep 
moving east because the British were comi ng. 
 

Q: This was east fr om Buchenwald?  Reme mber we started in Auschwitz. 

 

A: We skipped a couple. 

 

Q: From Auschwitz we go west.  Now do 
you have any knowledge of your father™s 
leaving Auschwitz because that™s the firs
t step?   We™ve got to get him out of 
Auschwitz before we get him to the other camps. 
 

A: Right.  One of them was  th
e cattle cars.  In th
e beginning they still had cattle cars.  
Later on they begin to ma rch on foot because again the German war effort 

required the trains. 
 

Q: And they were falling apart? 

 

A: Falling apart.  So I guess I™m sure the first 
time  or two they still had the cattle ca rs 
and they were stuck on the train for a 
couple of days.  They didn™t have any– 
 

Q: The three of them together still? 

 

A: I believe so, I believe so. 
 
Q: How is your Grandpa holdi
ng up?   I mean he™s got to
 be a good deal older to 
begin with. 
 

A: Yes.  He was hanging in there at this 
point still.  And the way they would get 
water they would stick those 
little cups I told you a
bout and they would take-- I 
guess they had a string around the wa ist to k
eep their pants up -- and they tied that 
around the cup, one end of the cup, one 
string around the cup and they would 
hang it out the little holes in 
the cattle cars so they™d sc
oop some  of the snow that 
was adjacent to the train as it went  by so that was the refreshment. 
 

Q: So they were being moved around in the winter. 

 

A: Right.  Wha t  happened to my grandfathe
r was that they were
 being relocated at 
one point and they had to ma rch on foot. 
 

(End of Side One) 

 

 
 
19
Q: So we were talking about your family is
 being marched from one camp to another 
and you were going to tell me  some thing a
bout your grandfather who is too weak 
or feeling weak. 
 
A: His legs were giving out and he felt he
 couldn™t take it.  So the two boys, my 
father and Jussi gathered around him.  Th
ey didn™t want to leave without him so 
my grandfather told them to go and they still wouldn™t go because they didn™t 

want to abandon him so he commande
d them, you know like invoked biblical 
thou shalt honor thy father and thy moth
er and he commanded them to go.  And 
so they left.  My father later learned that
 this camp -- the Germans of course were 
going to kill everybody, destroy the camp 
because they had to destroy evidence 

but this camp apparently wa
s liberated by the Russians. 
 

Q: The camp that they were leaving? 

 

A: Right and my grandfather was liberated 
by the Russians it seemed, later my father 
learned because the Germans didn™t have time to shoot the prisoners. 
 

Q: But you don™t know the name  of the camp?  

 

A: No. 

 

Q: And you don™t know when this happened, this separation? 

 

A: No, I don™t know. 

 
Q: Time  of the year?   Nothing in your fa
ther™s stories that reveal the season. 
 
A: No, not that I can think of. 

 

Q: But it wasn™t  Auschwitz? 

 

A: I don™t think it was Auschwitz, no. 

 

Q: And it certainly wouldn™t be Buchenwald. 

 

A: I don™t know. 

 

Q: Okay, so your grandfather was liberated by the Russians? 

 

A: Right, right and my father 
later lear ned that he was ta
ken to Si beria but he never 
came back.  The Russians treated the Jews
 as prisoners -- there were freezing 
conditions in Siberia and he apparently died
 in Si beria.  I don™t have any detailed 
knowledge on what happened to him because 
my father only heard through sort of 
people who came back from Siberia and it was sketchy. 
 

 
 
20
Q: So your father and 
your uncle are ma rching– 
 

A: But had they stayed in that camp they
 would have been liberated by the Russians 
and the Russian camp would probably be be
tter than the death camp so it would 
have been a better deal. 
 

Q: Why was your father able to stay?   
I mean there™s storie
s too of the Germans 
shooting people who couldn™t ma rch. 
 

A: Right, I guess they didn™t have -- my 
grandfather -- I guess di
dn™t have time  to 
shoot him. 
 

Q: But your father and your uncle 
were forced literally at gunpoint? 
 

A: Tomarch? 

 

Q: Yeah, I me a n at one point it sounds
 like your grandfathe
r commands them to 
ma rch but at any point are they being forced ma rched by Germans/  
 

A: Idon™tthink–. 

 

Q: Would they have been free to stay if they had? 

 

A: I see what you™re saying.  If they had 
pretended that they were sick and couldn™t 
ma rch then they -- the Germans we
ren™t going to go around sending around 

doctors checking everybody so 
I guess if they were pretending they were sick 
they could have stayed. 
 

Q: But did they realize that 
your grandfather would in fact 
survive that way?  I mean 
very often the Germans would kill people who were too si ck to move 
 

A: Right and I guess they sort of expected 
that because their atti
tude of not wanting 
to abandon him shows t hat, I think. 
 

Q: That™s why I™m asking these questions. 

 

A: Right, I think they figured that he
™d be killed but 
nothing was certain. 
 

Q: Nothing was logical. 

 

A: Nothing was logical, right. 

 

Q: So how about this ma rch that
 your father and your uncle–..? 

 

A: Now here™s the big ma rch what happened. 
 First everyone was gi
ve relatively big 
loaf of bread.  Again my father™s philosophy 
was not to save it but just to eat it 

 
 
21
right away for fear of getti
ng lost or stolen.  And they
™ll be ma rched and it was a 
long ma rch without food–..you had to ma rch I think like eight or four in a row 
and if you fell behi nd then you™ll be  shot
 because there was a German truck 
behind you.  And see if you slow down --- bu
t they didn™t gi ve you time to sleep 
so what happened was they would sleep, so
rt of sleep as they ma rched and so like 
lean on each other or some thing as they continued to walk. 
 

Q: How long did this go on? 

 

A: I think it was a three day trip. 

 

Q: Threedayswithout 
sleeping?   No rest? 
 

A: Without sleeping, yes.  At one point they
 came across a ma rsh near the side of the 
road and they were so thirsty that the 
people started running for the water and the 
Germans started shooting because they didn™t 
tolerate the lack of discipline.  My 
father didn™t run because he knew that 
despite like his natural urge, almost 
irresistible urge for water and for rest he kept going.  And this is some thing else 

that happened.  This sort of
 thing ? repeated later.  At
 one point they were given a 
chance for a hot shower.  There was a big 
room full of hot showers and the people 
would be there for a few mi nutes but then
 they had to come  out, after about two 
mi nutes or so.  And some people were so -- you know enjoyed the shower so 

much that they just wouldn™t come  out. 
 The Germans would come  in there with 
like with sticks and start beating them 
and they still -- you know people would 
just collapse under the shower rather than 
walk out because they were so deprived 

of any sort of physical comfort. 
 

Q: And this felt good. 

 

A: Right and this felt good.  My father tells 
me  that he wished that once more in his 
life he can get a full meal of baked potatoes and then he can die, you know like 

his last wish but to feel satisfied 
with a stomach full 
of baked potatoes. 
 

Q: So where did they go? 

 

A: They went to another camp. 

 

Q: You don™t know the name. 

 

A: I don™t know the name , some  landmarks along the way.  One time one of the 
prisoners took with him a pair of phylacterites (tfillin).  He put it in hi s shoes.  He 

snuck into the barracks at night.  And so
 the people who were religious which I 
guess were most of them, I don™t know, a 
lot of them stayed up all ni ght putting 
on the phylacterites, just  putting it on quick
ly and taking it off, just for a second 
because they weren™t given an opportunity to pray. 
 

 
 
22
Q: Where had they come  fr om? 
 

A: One of the prisoners snuck it in his shoes. 

 

Q: All of this time they had -- or was this a new prisoner? 

 

A: This was a new prisoner who snuck it in
 and it disappeared or some thing after a 
while.  It wasn™t like an ongoing thing.  Al
so later on toward the end he used to 
stay out of the barracks and stay outside 
because the barracks were too crowded.  
If you stayed outside and caught you™d be 
shot but it was still worth once in a 
while because I think there were about four people in the bed or something.  So 

what he did was he™d hide under the dead 
bodies so he could ha
ve a -- stay out 
you know. 
 

Q: Yet you don™t know which camp this was?   Probably Bergen-Belsen from my 
guess. 
 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: And he was never caught sleeping outdoors? 

 

A: No, I guess he wasn™t.  After time went on 
toward the end all they had -- their sole 
task -- they didn™t ha ve to work any mo
re ??? enter the factors -- their sole task 
was to pull the dead bodies and pull them into this big grave.  So they would have 

this little stick with a little thing, hook, at
 the end and they w
ould put the stick like 
underneath the dead bodies -- I mean th
ey weren™ t necessarily dead, you didn™t 
know, you thought they were dead but you didn™t have time  to check their pulse 

or anything -- you put it underneath their 
chin and you pull that
 stick with the 
thing at the end and you pull the bodies th
at way into this big grave.  You 
[indistinct] hide the evidence because the Germans were running out of time. 
 

Q: So prisoners like your father were doing this? 

 

A: Right, for months he did this. 

 

Q: Your father and your uncle? 

 

A: Yes.  My uncle was getting very weak by this point. 

 

Q: Anythingelse? 

 

A: A few more things.  Wh
en they were liberated– 
 

Q: This was at Bergen-Belse n? 

 

A: You know the British liberated them. 

 
 
23
 
Q: Bergen-Belsen.  Do you know the time  of the year? 

 

A: The time of the year, I don™t know. 

 

Q: Spring,™45,April. 

 

A: Okay.  So they came around with loud
speakers and it was announced in several 
languages that here we are to come  to
 liberate you.  My father was semi -

conscious at this point.  He was laying on 
the floor and he didn™t really understand 
what was going on.  He really didn™t understa
nd what liberation meant.  So they -- 
the British came  around with these sort 
of parame dics who would check who was 
still alive and they thought my father wa
s dead because he wa s in horrible shape, 
emaciate and what have you.  And my fath
er sort of unconscious let out a sigh.  

He wasn™t conscious of what was going on 
but I guess deep inside he had to let 

other people know that he  was still aliv
e because they were about to pull hi m 
away with the other dead bodies.  So that™s how he was saved and he was put in 

the same  --they were put in beds.  Ther
e were two people per bed at this point 
because the British di dn™t have enough rati
ons.  And all the British ha d was these 
cans of lard that they ha
d -- given to the prisoners.  It was awful.  Imagine 
swallowing lard without any other food or
 anything.  So you had to like just 
swallow it because again my father would ju
st eat anything to survive.  My father 

informed the people that he had a brother,
 Jussi and that they should bring him to 
him.  So the next night they
 were together.  They were 
in the same  bed  They slept 
head to foot.  And Jussi couldn™t sw
allow the lard because he was too 
ma lnourished or he just couldn™t do it phys
ically but he just couldn™t swallow the 
lard.  Had he been able to swallow th
e lard or had there been proper me dical 
attention at this point he still coul d have
 been save d because -- Jussi still could 
have been saved because the --you --- he 
wasn™t like -- he was still conscious and 
he was still relatively spea
king okay.  And so like the next night my father woke 
up, the next morning and Jussi 
didn™t move and that™s wh
en my father -- I think 
he had a ma jor, a ma jor I won™t call it a nervous breakdown but he had a ma jor 

sort of you know a ma jor depression for se
veral days or several weeks because 
this was the last me mber of the fa mily, 
the last connection with reality that was 
still there for him.  
 

Q: When ---I™m still trying to follow th
e chronology describe d.  How ma ny days 
after liberation did he die?   You have th
em liberated.  The Br itish come  in and 
then– 
 

A: Within two or three days. 

 

Q: The second day your father asked the Brit
ish if he could bunk with your uncle and 
then another day and your uncle dies? 
 

A: Right, right so it would ha
ve to be the first three or
 four days or some thing. 

 
 
24
 
Q: So you™d say two or three days later. 
 The other thing I k
eep wondering about is 
the lard itself.  I mean of all the things to be eating–  
 

A: Well this is surplus. 

 

Q: Yeah, I know.  I™m saying their stomachs 
and their bodies weren™t used to very 
rich food.  If it hadn™t been
 lard, if it had been some th
ing mo re modest like just 
bread or a turnip or some thing it mi ght
 not have done as muc h dama ge.  There 
were thousands of people who died afte
r liberation because they couldn™t handle 
the food that the British gave them. 
 

A: Yeah, yeah, the British were cl
early under prepared for this thing. 
 

Q: Yeah, yeah, so your uncle Jussi dies in
 Bergen-Belsen.  Your father recovers. 
 

A: Right.  Actually when they were libe
rated what happened was they went into 
these showers and this sort of chemical
 was dumped on them to sort of delouse 
them. 
 

Q: DDTprobably. 

 

A: And because they just ha d lice and what 
-- all these different parasi tes.  Then he 
gets taken to Sweden.  He was there for two year. 
 

Q: Your father went to Sweden. 
 
A: Yes.  This rich benefactor donated 
his personal yacht to be used for the 
transpor tation of the prisoners to Sweden and my  father tells me that they, like 

they -- ther e was this fake like leat her s
eats and stuff.  The prisoners tore the 

leather seats.  And they just went berser
k  I™m not sure if it wa s envy or anger or 
just not being able to deal with luxury 
and they just tore the leather seats -- or 
––(indistinct) have some thing for themselves
 so they tore the thing.  My father 
had TB from his experience and he was th
ere for six months and he recovered.  

The doctors didn™t think that he w
ould but he recovered from the TB. 
 

Q: Where was he for six months? 

 

A: In Sweden, a Swedish clinic. 

 

Q: But he™s in Sweden for two years? 

 

A: Yeah, but for six months he was– 

 

Q: In a clinic for six months. 

 

 
 
25
A: Yeah, right, and he couldn™t
, he couldn™t --- he was very
 sick.  For the first I don™t 
know how ma ny months he couldn™t move, 
he couldn™t get off the bed and he 
started learning Swedish.  He sort of s
poke -- he spoke Germa n from befor e  -- and 
he was able to get a German-Swedish di
ctionary and he got Swedish newspapers 
and he sort of taught hims elf Swedish.  
That was one of the other languages he 
spoke.  He also spoke French. 
 

Q: Did he ever go back to his home- town after the war. 

 

A: Right, yeah, I™m getting to that.  After tw
o years or during his stay in Sweden he 
got in touc h with his cousins who we re in Nyireghaza and he opened up the 

hardware store again because again ther
e was a period before communism after 
the Nazis. 
 

Q: Twoyears. 

 

A: Two years, okay so he wasn™t sure b
ecause I think he Œ this is sort of like 
apocryphal but I think one of 
the nurses he got really friendly with.  I™m not sure 
what the love interest, whatever was. He rode around on a bicycle and he was 

very impressed by the socialist, or I™m not sure it was socialist but (indistinct) 

friendly ---- the outlook.  One of the th
ings --- that if they found a piece of 
clothing on the street that was lost the 
Swedish would like instead of keeping it 
for themselves they would take it and they
 put it on a tree or
 some thing or hang it 
some place where it was visible so if these people returned, a person returned to 

look for it they would find it, th
at kind of thing.  He was very impressed with that.  
And also just the generosity that here was 
a clinic for free.  He wasn™t a taxpayer 
or anything.  And the general treatment 
by the Swedes.  So then he -- but he 
decided to go back to his cousins in Ny
ireghaza.  These cousins are now he re in 
New York.  They left Hungary later, 
before my fa ther 
but after the war. 
 

Q: By any chance is one of these cousins the holder of your father™s passport? 

 

A: Yes, yes.  Mitsu was the–yeah. 

 

Q: So your father returns–.. 

 

A: Father returns and then let™s see and th
en they got the hardware store going and 
then the communists come.  Hardware stor
e goes again.  Hardware store is taken 
away again.  He goes to work in a hardware
 store as an employee.  He ma r r ies my 
mother who™s home is Budapest.  She wa
s vacationing near Nyireghaza.  She™s 
from Budapest. 
 

Q: She meets your father. 

 

A: Meets my fa ther and then later they 
get a license to open a private wire fence 
ma king shop.  In Hungary you™re allo
wed little enterprises like that. 

 
 
26
 
Q: Where was the Shop? 

 

A: Nyireghaza. 

 

Q: So your mot her leaves Budapest
 to live there with your father? 

 

A: Yes,yes. 

 

Q: She must have really loved him.  

 

A: Actually she™ll tell you a
bout this but her conditions were really bad.  She was an 
orphan after the war living with a great-
aunt  that was very me an to the three 
children and her conditions were really -- compared to his–. 
 

Q: Okay, I understand.  But I mean norma lly
 a person doesn™t leave Budapest to go 
to this little town in the boonies. 
 So when do they come  to America? 
 

A: 1977. 

 

Q: So late?   So they lived in Hungary until 1977. 

 

A: Right.  I was born there.  I was bor
n in Hungary.  I was ten years old. 
 

Q: 1977 so they saw a lot.  They saw Maj they saw Kadar. 

 
A: That™s right and he went
 through communis m, he went through fascism, he went 
through all these great twen
tieth century theories. 
 
Q: And there was no looking back when they came here?   They never returned. 

 

A: They never returned, no.  Actually they 
intended to go to Isra
el all the while but 
then my sister ma rried an American and she moved here.  That™s why they came  

to America. 
 

Q: When did they ma rry by the way?   Did they ma rry in the -- it must have been the 
late forties. 
 

A: Fifty-three I think.  Uh, uh check that. 
 Let me  think.  I don™t know.  My sister 
was born in ™53, I think.  Let me  think.  
I was born in ™66 and she™s twelve years 
older than I am so she must have been 
born in ™54 and I think that they were 
ma rried three years when she was born so
 I think they got ma rried in ™51. 
 

Q: ™51.  I™ll put ™50, ™51.  Your mother 
will know, I™m sure.  She™ll know the exact 
date. 
 

 
 
27
A: Yeah, she will.  And then they came back.  Oh, I have to go back.  When they 
came back, before they came back he aske
d -- the Hungarians had moved into his 
house and so he wanted it back but they w
ouldn™t give it back to him.  There were 
certain pieces of furniture that he wanted 
back and I think there were a few things 
that he got back but there 
was a whole lengthy process.  See the Hungarian courts 
at some  point were very favorable to the 
Jewish claims because they knew that the 
fascists are out and– 
 
Q: And Jews could not be considered I imagin
e as being fascists or pro-fascist.  They 
were safely anti-fascist.  And you couldn™
t say the same  about other Hungarians. 
 

A: Right and if you were per
ceived -- if the court or to 
the judge was being pro the 
people who took ??  the 
fascists you ma y be.. 
 

Q: You ma y be accused of pro-fascism. 

 

A: Right.  Again this was the time when 
the communists, wasn™t communists but saw 
the communists were comi ng. 
 

Q: They were comi ng. 

 

A: Yeah and the communists were
n™t too fond of the fascists 
either.  So that™s why he 
was able to get some  of his furniture.  
He found some  of the stuff that was hidden 
like he found his box of
 thread and stuff 
 

Q: Did anyone from his fa mily survive besides him? 
 
A: No.  His five siblings an
d his parents died.  He was the only survivor except for 
these cousins but they we re not immediate family. 
 

Q: But in the immediate family everyone died. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Grandparents, parents and siblings. 

 

A: Right.  One little quick story my father 
told me  that one particular Jew he came 
back and he, how was it, he dema nde d -- he dema nded his property and he got 

into a fight with the Hungarian, the non-Jewi
sh Hungarian owner.  So he got into 
a fight and the Jewish guy slapped him so
 the Hungarian guy sued him for battery 
or some thing so they went to court.  Agai
n the court was sort of reluctant to award 
a lot of money so they fined him a relatively small fine, fined the Jew a relatively 

small fi ne so the Jew took out twice, twice the fi ne that was assessed, gave it to 

the judge and slapped the Hunga
rian again.  He said it was worth it.  Do you have 
any particular questions? 
 

 
 
28
Q: It seems that you™ve covered I mean everything that you would be able to 
reme mber.  Obviously you weren™t there.  
It would be nice to know the camps.  
Fortunately I do have your father™s summar
y.  That™s why I was able to put camps 
in your mouth so to speak.  I know that 
he was in Dora and he was at Bergen-
Belsen and so forth. 
 

A: Where is this from?   Wh at are you reading here? 

 

Q: This is from the American gathering, 
the registry, the one (??) had all the photos 
on? 
 

A: Oh,Okay.  

 

Q: And I think after we™ve fi nished with
 the tapes if you would I would ask you to 
name  your father™s other 
brothers and sisters. 
 

A: I don™t know their name s.  I just know Jussi. 

 

Q: Your mother mi ght know. 

 

A: Actually there™s a cousin that mi ght 
know actually.  We  have a cousin who with 
his help–.[indistinct] 
 

Q: That™s it really.  Thank you very muc h. 

 

A: Thankyou. 
 
Q: And I look forward to talking to your mother. 

 

A: Okay, thank you.
