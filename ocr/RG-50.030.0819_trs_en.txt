Question:
 
This is a 
United States
 
Holocaust
 
Memorial
 
Museum
 
interview with 
Mr. 
Robert Max
, on July
1 4
th
, 2015, in 
Summit
,
 
New Jersey
. I™m very grateful to 
you, Mr.
 
Max
, for agreeing to speak with us today, and I want to make a note at the 
beginning of this
 
interview, that you are doing so barely a week after you have 
buried your wife and partner of 67 years, and I 
Œ 
if 
Œ  
I would like to begin the 
interview with your thoughts of why you decided to do this at this particular 
moment, when such 
Œ 
when you™ve su
ffered such a loss, and then we™ll continue 
with our usual interview.
 

Answer: Mm
-
hm. The loss of my wife was se vere. It was a shock to me, but it was 
immediate . My wife was my partner in everything that I did, my entire life , for 67 

years. She would have w
anted 
Œ  
she would have wanted to be here, she would have 
wanted to see the interview going on, because she knew all of the experience
s 
that I 
will talk about. And 
Œ 
and that bolstered me, and I 
Œ 
I decided that yes, she would 
definitely want me to do this,
 
and thus 
Œ 
I did not make the call, but I might have 
made, to you, 
Ina
. 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: And in the mem 
Œ 
in memory of her, and 
Œ 
and 
I™ll be thinking of her while I™m 
talking with you 
Œ

Q: And her name is 
Shirley
. 
A: 
Œ  
I™d want to do it. Her name is 
Shirley
. 
Q: 
Shirley Max
. 
A: 
Shirley Max
, yes, yes.
 
Q: Okay. Well, thank you, I am grateful, and I am honored that you have decided to 
go forth, even at such a moment, so 
Œ 

A: Thank you.
 
Q: So we™re going to start our interview, like we do, at the very beginning. I want to 

find out about your life growing up, before you joined the army, a nd then we™ll go 

into all of these experiences, that are the core of the story.
 
A: Mm
-
hm.
 
Q: So the first questions are very simple. Could you tell me your name at birth, and 

your da
te of birth?
 
A: Mm
-
hm. My name was 
Robert Roger Max
, and I was born on July 10
th
, 1923.
 
Q: Where?
 
A: In 
Œ 
in 
Newark
. 
Q: In 
Newark
,
 
New Je rsey
? 
A: 
Newark

Q: Okay. And was your family name always 
Max
, or was it shortened from
 
something else?
 
A: There™s a lot of question 
Œ 
questioning and doubt about it. Some tell me that it 
wasn™t 
Max
, some tell me it was 
Marx
, and I learned just a few years ago, that it 
was really 
Manczyk
, 
m -a -n -c-z-y -k
, and we had relatives in 
Brazil
, the 
Ma
n czyk
 
family.
 
Q: Wow.
 
A: So, it was a revelation to me, but all the years I™ve lived with 
Max
, 
so
 
I couldn™t 
see changing it, so it remains.
 
Q: You stayed that way, yeah. When did your family come over from 
Europe
? 
A: My 
Œ  
I don™t really remember wa 
Œ 
I don™t know. I don™t know when they came 
over. But I know my grand 
Œ  
on my 
Œ  
on my father™s side, my grandparents came 
from 
Poland
 Œ  
I™m just 
[indecipherable]
 
my mother™s fa mily came  from 
France
, 
and my in
-
laws came from 
Poland
. 
Ptczuk
(ph),
 
Poland
. 
Q: 
Ptczuk
(
ph).
 
A: 
Ptczuk
(ph), 
p -t-c-z-u -k
, 
something like that.
 
Q: Okay
. 
A: Tough to pronounce, even tougher to spell.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
6
 
Q: Yeah. Well, you know, so many of these places, particularly in eastern 
Europe
, 
have five
 
iterations of 
Œ 
of the same name 
Œ 
I mean, the same village, or the same 
town, the same place, in different languages.
 
A: Mm
-
hm.
 
Q: Whether it would have been Polish, or Yiddish, or Russian, or 
Œ 
or German, or 
Œ 
or something else. They all, you know, me 
Œ  
very small places often had five 
names. So, 
Ptczuk
(ph) 
Œ 
A: 
Ptczuk
(ph).
 
Q: 
Œ  
who knows how else it™s ca lled, and where it would be.
 
A: Yes. Well, my wife 
Shirley 
sp
-
spent years, years, trying to trace where it is. She 
never had found it yet, so conceivably, it doesn™t even exist any more. But she 
reme mbers her
 
mother telling her 
Œ 
Q: Yeah?
 
A: 
Œ  
that™s where they were 
Œ 
that™s where they were from.
 
Q: Tell me a little  bit a bout your own family that you were born into. Did you have 

brothers and sisters?
 
A: I had an older brother, who was eight years older, and a sister who was two years 
younger.
 
Q: Okay, so he was born in 1915, your brother?

A: 1915, mm

hm.
 
Q: And what was his name?
 
A: 
Lester
. 
Q: 
Lester
. Did he also fight in the war?
 
A: He did.
 
Q: He did.
 

A: Mm
-
hm.
 
Q: And 
your siste r, what was her name?
 
A: 
Ruth
. 
Q
: She was born in 1925?
 
A: Twenty
-
five, right.
 
Q: Okay. What were your parents™ names?
 
A: 
Jenny
 
and 
Herman
. 
Q: Okay.
 
A: And 
Jenny
™
s
 
maiden name was 
Jenny Kahn
(ph).
 
Q: And what did your father do 
Œ  
and maybe it was also your mother 
Œ 
to support 
the family?
 
A: He 
Œ 
he was president of a retail milk company.
 
Q: Okay.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015

A: Essentially, they delivered milk to homes, and to stores, in the days when people 
got home 
Œ 
milk at home.
 
Q: How cool. I remember hearing about those, yeah.
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yes. And he was president of the co 
Œ 
of the company.
 
Q: Okay, so it was his.
 
A: Pardon?
 
Q: It was his company.
 
A: It wa 
Œ 
it was not 
Œ 
it was 
Œ  
there were five brothers. His grandfath 
Œ 
my 
grandfather, his father, founded the company, and then turned it over to the boys, 

and
 
bought himself a fa ncy 
Cadillac
, hired a chauffeur, and spent the rest of his life  
traveling
 
America
. And the boys worked hard.
 
Q: Knew how to live.
 

A: He did know how to live.
 

Q: Did you have 
Œ 
did you know him?
 
A: 
Yes, I 
Œ 
I di
-
did, briefly, and just sparingly. I just b
-b -
barely got
 
to 
Œ  
to 
Œ  
to 
Œ  
to 
know 
him. He died at a very early age; he never reached 50.
 
Q: Oh wow.
 
A: Well, he lived so well, you know, he smoked, drank, and 
Œ  
and rode in his 
Cadillac
.

Q: Wow.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Tell u 
Œ 
tell me a little bit
 
about 
Œ  
about the home you were born into. Describe it 
somewhat, you know, was it a house, what kind of a place was it? What are some of 
your earliest me mories? Tell me a bout those.
 

A: I™ll tell you the address, it was 329 
South Orange Avenue
 
in 
Newark
, 
N
ew 
Jersey
. 
Q: Okay.
 
A: And it was a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a tenement house. There were two may 
Œ 
two families. We 
occupied the first floor, and 
Œ 
and when I say tenement, there was a house adjoi 
Œ 
immediately adjoining it. One of my father™s brothers, my uncle, was in the
 
next 
apartment.
 

Q: Was it a  brownstone looking kind of place?
 
A: No, they weren™t brownstones, just wooden shingled homes.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: Not particularly fancy, but that was it, and we were on a major thoroughfare, 
with trolley lines, so forth. And the house was directly a cross the street from a 
reservoir, which year 
Œ 
years later, when I went back to see if the home was still 
there, the home was, but the reservoir was gone.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
10
 
Q: Wow.
 
A: They 
had 
built homes on the other side of the street.
 
Q: But while it was
 
a reservoir, was it a ccessible to people?
 
A: Not really, because it was a 
Œ 
a  county reservoir, providing water for the citizens. 
We just knew it was there, but all we saw were brick and stones and mortar, and we 
knew inside was water. That was about it.
 

Q: What about your parents™ own home? How many rooms did it have?
 
A: It™s hard for me to remember, I was very young when we moved from there. But, 

in fact, I don™t really re m 
Œ 
I think there were two bedrooms, there was a living 
room, there was a dining ro om, and that was 
Œ 
and the bathroom, a bathroom, and 
that was about it.
 

Q: Okay. It sounds very modest for the owe 
Œ 
well, the part owner, partial owner of 
a company.
 

A: Well, the 
Œ 
it was not really a big business, and we have five brothers all 
work
ing
 
to
gether, they all drain off the business. So we 
Œ 
let™s say friends, 
acquaintances, always thought they were wealthier than they really were. So we 

lived in a 
Œ 
yes, in a modest home.
 
Q: And you say you moved from there at some point?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
11
 
A: We moved from there
 
to another section in 
Newark
, the 
Œ 
the westernmost 
Œ 
most section, in the 
Vailsburg
 
section of 
Newark
, which is bordering on the town 
of 
South Orange
. And I will tell you, when we moved, it 
Œ 
well, the family got 
together, had a going away party. We were
 
still in 
Newark
, but they considered that 
so distant, that they had to have a party for us
. 
Q: So the rest of the uncles stayed on 
Œ  
there?
 
A: They remained in 
Œ 
no, they moved to the suburbs, too.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: It was very common in 
Newark
 
during those years, for je 
Œ 
for Jewish families 
in particular, to move, when they™re able to, to move to the suburban areas. And 
each of the 
Œ  
as I recall, each of the brothers did move to a different suburban town 
in 
New Jersey
. 
Q: Did 
Œ  
was the strai 
Œ  
did you live 
Œi
n the original place, was the street that you 
lived on almost exclusively Jewish? Were you in a Jewish neighborhood, or was it 

mixed?
 
A: It was totally mixed. 
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: I 
Œ  
I never lived in the Jewish neighborhood. I was going to say I never had the 
privileg
e of living in a Jewish neighborhood. I suppose I would have liked it. But 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
12
 
no, we 
Œ  
we were in mixed neighborhoods, where our neighbors were 
Œ 
I know a 
number of them were Italians, and Poles. I don™t recall if there were any Jews even, 
in the area wh
ere we were. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So you could have been the only family.
 

A: Hm?
 
Q: You could have been the only Jewish family.
 
A: Just the 
Œ 
the next door 
Œ  
the house next door, as I me ntioned before, was wa 
Œ 
one of my uncles. And we were the 
Œ  
I think the only Jewish people in the area, 
yeah.
 
Q: How old 
were you when you an 
Œ 
when you moved?
 
A: I try to remember, but it was probably kindergarten age, because I reme mber I 

entered another school. No, I do 
Œ 
no, I did, before we moved, I did have 
kindergarte
n in a local school there. So I would 
Œ 
would have been what, six or 
seven when we moved.
 
Q: And in that 
Œ 
in those first six or seven years, are  there any incidents from your 
childhood that you still remember today, that kind of stand out?
 
A: Yeah, one that I keep 
Œ 
keep thinking about, certainly around Christmastime. 
Now, we were observant, we belonged to a Reform congregation, but my father 

always insisted as dressing up as 
Santa Claus
. 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
13
 
Q: Did he really?
 
A: Yes. And he 
Œ  
and I 
Œ 
and I re 
Œ 
remembe r. There was an alleyway along 
Œ  
alongside of the house, and I remember his going up that alleyway, going,
 
ho, ho, 
ho, ho, ho, imitating 
Santa
. And 
Œ  
and gifts and all that. So, really in a 
Œ 
and 
Œ  
and 
it was a very strange thing, because we were very closely related to the 
Œ  
to a 
synagogue, and yet, we observed Christmas.
 
Q: Did you know it was him, or did you think it was 
Santa
? 
A: Oh, it took me a while to get to know it, but after a while I knew it, and, you 
know, he was exposed, and he stopped doing it after 
that, but 
Œ 

Q: Yeah.
 
A: You know, when I was 
Œ 
when 
Œ  
in the very, very beginning, I 
Œ 
I wasn™t quite 
sure, but after a while, it was 
Œ 
became obvious. Were 
Œ 
Q: Well, did it 
Œ 
did it feel strange to be observing Christmas when you were little, 
or this is something you just think about now, as an adult?
 
A: It was just a natural thing.
 

Q: Okay.
 
A: Because we were in that kind of a neighborhood, and everybody else observed i
t, 
and so we did, too.
 
Even though we, again, continued to practice our Judaism, we 
st
ill observed, to be part of the neighborhood.

Q: What™s your first memory, or maybe amongst your first memories, of going to a 
synagogue, of becoming part of the community, the Jewish community
? 
A: 
Mm-
hm. Well, going to synagogue, we belonged to a congregation in 
Newark
,
 
New Jersey
, 
B
™
Nai Jeshurun
, was extreme Reform. A very, very, very li
-
liberal 
congregation. And I remember my parents going there, and then when I was old 

enough, I started to go there, too. But we moved before I 
Œ 
there was anything 
signif
icant, but we maintained our membership in that congregation. It was on 
High 
Street in 
Newark
. And I don™t remember an ything particular about 
Œ 
about it, just
 
that
 
my mother was very particular about Friday nights, and Saturday mornings. 
And p
eople don™t always think that, well, you were a Reform Jew, so you™re not 
that ritualistic, I mean, you™re not that tied to it. But m
-m -
my mother was.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: And that carried on through my youth. Friday nights were always 
Œ 
always 
sacrosanct. You went to temple Friday night, and that™s what I did.
 

Q: And that™s some 
Œ 
that™s something that 
Œ 
that just sta yed constant from your 
very earliest years?
 
A: From my earliest years. As a matter of fact, when we moved to the 
Vailsburg
 

section, I was athletic, and I was part of an athletic group. Just a group that 
eventually just 
Œ 
was just below semi
-
professional. There were oth 
Œ  
there was only 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
15
 
one other Jew in the group, the others were all Christians. There were Poles and 
Italians. T his is in the 
Vailsburg
 
section of 
Newar
k
. They knew, though, and they 
respected the fact that Friday nights I would not hang out with them at the local 
soda shop. And they respected that very, very highly, as I respected their Christian 
faith, too. And I 
Œ 
well, some 
Œ 
some 
Œ  
some 
Œ  
sometime later, when it came  time 
for my first Bar Mitz
vah 
Œ  
this is something that
 
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I reme mber so vividly 
because it was so unusual. I invited all of the 
Œ 
the athletic group to my Bar Mitzvah 
service. And when I say the temple 
B
™
Nai Jeshurun
 
was ultra, ultra
 
liberal, th e Bar 
Mitzvah boy did not read from the Torah. All I did was prayer, the prayer before 

and after the reading of the Torah, and a speech. Now it™s Saturday morning, and 
I™m at my Bar Mitzvah, and I 
Œ 
I get up to make a speech. And I do, the typi
cal 
boys™ Bar Mitzvah, so today I am a man, etc etera. And when I finish 
Œ 
these guys, 
there must have been 10 or 11 of them, they got up, and they started to clap. Yo, 
Bobby
. They cheered, they whistled. The decorum, mostly on a Saturday morning, 
elderly women, very reserved, and so forth, they looked, and I saw the heads 
Œ  
I 
could see from the 
Œ 
from the 
bema
, 
the heads of the people just dropped, oh my 
God
. They™re just wa 
Œ 
wa
-
waving their heads from side to side. They had never 
seen a demonstration like
 
that before. However, as I say, my 
Œ 
my friends, 
Christians, were very ver 
Œ 
very, very well aware 
that
 
Friday night I would not hang 

 
Interview with Robert Max

out. But I
 Œ 
as 
Œ  
in recip 
Œ 
reciprocating for their coming to my Bar Mitzvah, I 
attended Catholic midnight mass 
Œ 
Q: Oh,
 
did you really?
 
A: 
Œ  
that year, yes, I went to the 
Sacred Heart
 
church in 
Vailsburg
 
section in 
Newark
, to be, because they were all Christia ns, and they were there at the church, 
so I said, I will come to your church now. And I did.
 
Q: That™s a  very unusual story.
 
A: It™s a 
Œ 
Q: You know, it™s a very unusual sort of ex 
Œ  
set of experiences for the early 1930s, 
or the 
mid
-
1930s
. 
A: It 
Œ 
it would 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I think it was probably unique, because most everybody I 
knew, as 
Œ 
over the years, as I™ve grown up, most everybody I knew, certainly in the 
Jewish world, that ber 
Œ 
that grew up in 
Newark
, grew up in the 
W eequahic 
section of 
Newark
, which was 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I think of it as a rich man™s ghetto, because 
it was all Je wish, but there were nice homes, a nd well
-
to
-
do p
eople. Others that 
were not well
-
to
-
do, too, but it was preserved very, very well, as long as they were 
there. So I always felt that I misse d out on something that was significant. I never 
had 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I did not live in wa 
Œ  
in a Jewish section, did not live near Jewish 
people, but I never had any acts of anti
-
Semitism, despite  the fact tha t I 
Œ 
I evolved, 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
17
 
circu 
Œ  
circulated in a Christian world. Just never ran into it. And somehow I 
Œ 
I felt 
even deprived, because of the experience. You have to know what 
anti
-
Semitism is, 
you have to feel it yourself, I™ve 
Œ 
I™ve always believed, and I fe 
Œ 
I didn™t feel it. It 
wasn™t until later on in life that I really got to understand it. Well, I studied it more, 
and became active in community life things. But no, I was deprived of one of the 
Œ 
I 
shouldn™t call it a  joy, but one of the experiences that ma ny young Jewish boys went 

through.
 
Q: Well, it™s a 
Œ 
it™s a  nice 
Œ 
it™s 
Œ  
as deprivations go, this is probably one that one 
would want to have, you know?
 
A: As nice a o ne as I could have wanted, yeah.
 
Q: Yeah. Let™s ta lk a little bit about family dynamics. Your 
Œ  
you had an older 
brother, eight years older. Wha 
Œ 
what was your relationship with him like?
 
A: Like father and son. My father worked very often in the eve 
Œ 
ev
enings. And 
Lester 
Œ  
eight years 
older, it was a pretty big spread. He took over as 
Œ 
as my 
father. At the age of three 
Œ 
I have pictures of that remarkable 
Œ 
he bought me a 
New York Yankee
 
baseball uniform; cleats, a glove, bat and ball.
 
Q: Oh my gosh.
 
Oh
 
my gosh.
 
A: 
And he wa 
Œ  
he wou 
Œ  
the house that we lived on, that I mentioned, on 
South 
Orange
 
Avenue
 
in 
Newark
, had a backyard, and there was a fence separating it

from the house behind. He pitched to me. Now, I shouldn™t say 
Œ 
and 
Œ  
and I swung 
the bat,
 
but really, he was a good pitcher, and he would hit the bat. He kept my 
batting average 
Œ 
and the best that I can reme mber, one season he had me batting 
.575. Now that was even bigger 
Œ  
much, much bigger than 
Ted W illiams
 
.400 
batting average, you know? And he kept record of homeruns, the fence was about 
maybe a hundred feet away, li 
Œ 
and so, every now and then he would hit the bat 
perfectly, and I would swing a little bit, and we go over the fence. So we kept my 
homerun record, and all of that. He taught
 
me baseball, took me to 
Rupert
 
Stadium 
in 
Newark
, the trolley was right across the street from our house, took us down to 
Newark
, a nd followed the 
New York Yankee
, the farm tea m, the  
Newark Bears
. 
But 
Œ  
so he 
Œ 
he re
-
really 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I guessed, introduced
 
me to sports, all sports, and 
I think acted very much like a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a father. When he 
Œ 
Q: He sounds like a wonderful older brother.
 
A: It wa 
Œ 
it was 
Œ  
it was a 
Œ 
just a  marvelous rel
-
rela tionship. And during the war 
Œ 
you know, World War II was partially
Œ  
par
-
partially financed by the American 
people
. There were signs all over, buy war bonds. And so he bought war bonds for 

me. I was just 
Œ  
just a young kid yet. So I already had war bonds going for me. He 
was that 
Œ 

Q: When did he buy them? What year would have this been?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015

A: Oh, that would have been 
Œ 
well, surely after war was de
-
declared, so the early 
Œ 
Q: It 
Œ 
after ™41.
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: After ™41.
 
A: After ™41, right.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: And 
Œ  
and the bonds were a
v -
available, so he bought some. And when he went 
into
 
the service too, he bought bonds, even he had allocation taken out of his pay, 
which was very moderate, and he was marrie d at the time, and he had an allocation 
taken out in war 
Œ 
in bonds bought for me. Very, very strong relationship.
 
Q: What els 
Œ 
what 
did he teach you? What do you 
Œ  
what are some of the 
Œ 
you 
know, clearly, he showed an absolute adoration of a little boy 
Œ 

A: Mm
-
hm.
 
Q: 
Œ  
to buy him a base ball suit 
Œ  
A: Yeah.
 
Q: 
Œ  
and 
Œ  
and make sure that he bats, and 
Œ 
and builds his confidence, and 
Œ a
nd 
has a great homerun score, and a batting average
 
score. What kind of a personality 
was he, and what are the things that he bequeathed to you from that?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
20
 
A: Well, try 
Œ 
he was a 
Œ  
he was basically a 
Œ  
a good person, so what he was doing 
for me, I don™t know that he did a great deal in philanthropy, or charity, and all that, 
but he was just basically very good. Had strong, strong ties to family. And he 
reme mbered my birth, which was in a 
Œ  
it was a private home, they called it 
Essex 
General Hospital
, but it
 
was somebody™s home
, and I was born in a bedroom in 
that home. And he reminded me time and time again, that he saw me at birth, lying 
Œ  
just 
Œ  
just after birth, lying out in the hallway of that house, in a lea ther covered 
Œ 
lea
-
leather seat, a chair, a li
ttle 
Œ  
he said, you were about this big. He used to 
describe it to me often. So, I 
Œ 
I guess in a se  
Œ  
in 
Œ  
in a sense, he 
Œ 
he 
Œ  
he was 
there at the very, very beginning, and just 
Œ 
I was the first child after him, and he 
took a responsibility. He was eight years old at the time, and was mature enough to 

say, this is my little brother. And somewhere within him, he must have said, and 

I™m going to see that he 
Œ 
I™m going to care for him, cause Papa™s not around 
enough, and Mama has her things to do. But I™m
 
going to see that he gets well cared 
for, and he did, the rest of his life.
 
Q: Wow. I would usually save this
 
for another part of our interview, but I™d like to 
talk to you about your brother a little bit more . You say he all 
Œ 
I™d like to find out 
what his destiny was. So, let™s sta rt with the war.
 

A: Mm
-
hm.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max

Q: Let™s sa y, by that point he was an adult, and he was married.
 
A: Right.
 
Q: Did he volunteer, or was he drafted? Wha 
Œ  
how did that 
Œ  
what happened?
 
A: Okay, he volunteered.
 

Q: Okay. And where did h
e serve?
 
A: He served the European theater, and I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I possibly should be telling you 
this later on, because in sequence 
Œ 
it™s out of sequence.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: But I think it™s 
Œ 
it™s more important that it relate s to the kind of person he was 
[indecipherable]
. If I get into th 
Œ  
in 
Œ  
in 
Œ  
I™m 
Œ  
I™m jumping ahead very far, I 
Œ 
Q: Would you 
Œ  
would you prefer that we wait a little bit? Because I do want to find 
out what happened to him, but we can do it now, we can do it later.
 

A: Ah, yeah. Ah, yeah, I t
hink ma 
Œ 
maybe 
we 
Œ  
sequentially 
Œ  
al
-
although 
Œ  
sequentially, I think we™ll hold it until later on.
 
Q: Okay, okay.
 
A: And 
Œ 
Q: And we™ll come bac k to that, then.
 
A: We™ll co
-
come back to that, because he had a role to play in my 
Œ 
Q: Ah.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015

A: 
Œ  
wartime experience, yes.
 
Q: Okay, then in that case we™ll hold on to it.
 
A: Mm
-
hm.
 
Q: Can we break, just for a second? 
[break]
 
So here we are, we were talking about 
Œ  
we were talking about your brother 
Lester
.  
A: Mm
-
hm.
 
Q: And we™ll postpone some of the discussion on
 
what his experiences were, for a 
little bit. Le t™s go back to talk about some of your other family me mbers. You had a 

little siste r.
 
A: Mm
-
hm.
 
Q: Her name was 
Ruth
. 
A: Right.
 

Q: And, tell me a  little  bit about 
Ruth
, and about the relationship that you guy
s had.
 
A: We grew up as typical brother sister. She had her group, I had my group.
 
Q: Did she tag along behind you?
 
A: No, she didn™t. She was independent. She had,
 
as
 
I say, her own group of young 
ladies, and I had my athletic group. They didn™t 
Œ 
they di
dn™t mix, really. We were 
two different 
Œ  
different types of 
Œ  
of groups. So I really didn™t have much 
interaction with her. We were, in a sense, a  close
-
knit family, but not that we played 

 
Interview with Robert Max

together. We went together. We would make many trips to 
Atlantic C
ity
, Mother, 
Father, Sister and me, but not my older brother. Again, eight years older, he was 
like in another world, and as I me ntioned, he was like my 
Œ 
like a father to me. So 
he had his activities going. He went to college long before I was eligible for that, 

and so we 
Œ  
we were not that close, other than the fact that, as I me ntioned, he was 
so, so close to me. So, we had our relationship, and my sister was pretty much out 

of
Œ  
out of it.
 
Q: What about your parents now? Tell me a little bit about their
 
personalities. What 
kind of people were they?
 
A: I said before that my father was president of the company. He was appointed so 
by his father, because he was the oldest. He was not a leader type to the younger 
brothers. Plus, a bookkeeper really ran that business. My father was content to fix 

milk boxes with hammers and nails. So it was in 
Œ 
it was in a 
Œ 
an uncomfortable 
role for h
im, and he signed checks as 
president of the company, and people outside 
in the 
Œ 
at our Jewish world, knew that he was president of the company, and there 
was prestige that went with it, and all, but act 
Œ  
in actuality he did not play that 
active a role. When I say that my brother took over because my father was often 
away at night, he was running trucks. He was delivering milk.
 
Q: Your father?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
24
 
A: My father, yes, he™s president of the company, but he da 
Œ 
so, he was just a 
different kind 
Œ  
different kind of per 
Œ 
of a person, and 
Œ 
Q: Was he a quiet person?
 
A: Yeah, he was pretty quiet. I wouldn™t say substantially so, but you know, not a 
boisterous kind of person, not a happy
-
go
-
lucky, jovial type person. Pretty sedate. 
But, I always thought, a good father. He 
Œ 
he always did things for me. We had 
special trips we 
Œ 
in those days, going 
Œ 
take 
Œ  
going out and 
Œ  
in the evening, 
ge
tting in the car, because we didn™t have air conditioning, you want to cool off 
during the summer, you take a ride in the car. We used to go down route 20 
Œ  
it was 
route 22 then, it™s route 29, national, now. And route tw 
Œ 
222, I™m sorry, national 
now, we
 
used to call it route 
Œ 
local, 
New Jersey
, route 29. And it was called 
Œ 
I 
called it the  hamburger route, because my father used to put us in the car on a 

summer evening, and go down the road, and there was a hamburger stand down 

there, and I liked the hamburgers. To get me to go to Friday night services, after 
services, there were two places we went on Friday nights. One was 
Eddis
™
s
(ph)
, 
a 
malted shop in 
Newark
, and the other was a pizza 
Œ 
I can™t remember the name  of 
it, sta r. 
Star
 
Pizze ria
. There is one
 
today, it™s in 
Orange
, but it™s not the same  
family. 
Star Pizze ria
. And because my father helped them with a connection, that 
they got their liquor license, they used to have 
Œ 
Friday nights, afte r service, we™d 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015

go into the kitchen, these big, huge ovens,
 
and they were cooking, making these 
pizzas there. And they were pizzas not quite the way they™re made today. They were 
made oh, olive oil, and spices and tomato 
Œ 
tomato 
Œ  
just 
Œ  
just 
Œ 
Q: Sounds delicious.
 
A: And very, very thin, very thin crust. But anyway, that™s 
Œ 
that™s the kind of 
relationship we 
Œ 
we had, in taking 
Œ 
so he was good to the family. Took us fairly 
frequently to 
Atlantic City
 
for a weekend. I loved staying in hotels. Sunday 
morning breakfast was just great. So he was 
Œ 
he was good to us
. 
Q: And 
Œ  
and your mom? Tell me  a little bit about her, what was she like?
 
A: Again, a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a very good mother. Wonderful cook. Really cared for her 
Œ  
her 
children. She used to take me and my siste r to 
Newark
, downtown 
Newark
 
frequently, when 
Newark
 
was 
one of the great citie s in 
America
. She would take 
us there for lunch, to a movie. There were more movie houses then, than there are 

today, and all that.
 
But I would say both, they were both really, really good parents 
to us. One thing that I™ve always regretted. If they wanted to talk so that we didn™t 

understand, they™d talk Yiddish. And 
Œ 
Q: That was going to be one of my questions.
 
A: Yeah, they talked Yiddish, but never enough in our presence, for us to acquire. 
And I always 
Œ 
always felt that in a 
Œi
n a sense, they let us down, because they 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
26
 
used to talk between themselves, but I didn™t learn very much from my parents. And 
I had to learn it mostly in my own way, starting to read newspapers 
Œ 

Q: And did you?
 
A: 
Œ  
listening to radio
. Pardon?
 
Q: And did y
ou?
 
A: I did. Oh, I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
at a pri 
Œ  
fairly early age, I 
st 
Œ  
I did read newspapers, more  
than just the comics, a nd I did list
en
 
to 
Œ  
I listened to radio 
Œ  
radio news broadcasts. 
But there were a lot of 
Œ 
a lot of things that I always begrudged the fact that they 
didn™t admit 
Œ 
they weren™t conscious 
Œ 
conscious of it. They could have instructed 
us on a lot of things. I usually go to the polls during elections and all that, and 
we 
were never taught
 
politics. I a lways wished that, you know, they 
Œ  
they knew 
no 
Œ  
something about 
Œ  
we had a Jewish mayor at one point, Mayor ma 
Œ  
Meyersee
(ph) 
Œ  
whose name 
Œ 
well, slips me for the moment
. 
Q: Mm
-
hm, in the 30s.
 
A: But anyway, the only 
Œ 
the only Jewish mayor in newar 
Œ 
in 
Newark
™
s 
history, 
and all the 
Œ  
so my father knew some of these people, but there were never any 
introductions, never any background with these people, never what the political 

scene was like, and so forth.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
27
 
Q: So, does the conversation then 
Œ  
it was it 
Œ 
the conversation at home didn™t 
revolve arou
nd the wild 
Œ  
wider world.
 
A: No, it didn™t. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Okay. And what 
Œ  
was that because your parents didn™t have that kind of 
interest, even though they might have had the connection?
 
A: I don™t think it was the interest, I th 
Œ 
I think it was just not the awareness.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: I 
Œ  
I think, maybe at that time some 
Œ  
probably a lot of parents were that way. 
Very, very different, as the decades went on, parents, you know, dinner table, you 
discuss issues of importance, and where you™re going to co llege, and what you field 
of studies are going to be. And here™s some of my experience as 
Œ 
as a doctor, or 
wha 
Œ  
wh
atever. World affairs, politics
 
on occasion. We didn™t do any of that. And 
Œ  
and 
Œ  
and I 
Œ 
I misse d it.
 
Q: Did you know your grandparents, a
side
 
from the grandpa who had the 
Cadillac
? 
A: Yeah, my grandfather I did it 
Œ 
didn™t know for very long, because he died 
before he was 50.
 
Q: Yeah.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
28
 
A: My grandmother though, was always considered a great, great old lady. Well, I 
shouldn™t say that. A great person. She lived 
Œ  
well, it must have been 
probably 
somewhere
 
around 90, which was extremely high in those day 
Œ 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: 
Œ  
in those days. She 
Œ 
she never learned to read or write English. She 
Œ  
she 
spoke 
Œ 
Q: Did she speak it?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: Did she speak it?
 
A: Did she speak 
Œ 
Q: English.
 
A: English? Yes, yeah. She acquired enough. Not a very, very good English, but 
couldn™t 
Œ  
could not write. And I remember 
Shirley
, my wife, getting a letter once 
from her. It was in hebe 
Œ 
it 
Œ  
it was in Yiddish, and s
he had to get somebody to 
interpret it for us. So, she could write in Yiddish, read Yiddish, whatever reading 

she did. Her produ 
Œ  
her dominant responsibility was running a household, and a 
Œ 
and 
a kitchen for, I think it was 1
0 to 20 people. The people wh
o  
wor 
Œ  
my 
grandfather had a farm 
Œ 
I said the milk business
. The milk bus 
Œ 
retail milk 

 
Interview with Robert Max

business evolved from the farm. They kept the 
Œ 
they owned 
Œ 
my grandfather 
owned what 
Œ  
a good 
Œ 
big part of what became 
Irvington Center
. 
Q: Oh, wow.
 
A: And we alway
s begrudged his 
Œ  
his act
-
activities, his 
Œ  
his traveling, and all that. 
What he did was to sell off parcels of land there, that later would have enriched his 
family so much, because it grew in value. He kept selling off parcels of land so he 

could go with
 
his re 
Œ 
maroon 
Cadillac
, and the chauffeur, and travel all over the 
country.
 
Q: And your grandmother, or not?
 
A: But 
Œ  
but she, now she 
Œ 
she had to carry the burden, because all the people they 
had working on the farm, and the 
Œ 
and the 
Œ 
the brothers and sisters, she cooked. 
She was a marvelous, marvelous cook, but that™s what she did, virtually all day, 

cooking and cleaning and laundry. That was her life.
 
Q: Oh my God, it™s a hard life.
 
A: Yes, yes, but sh 
Œ  
physically very, very active, until they had
 
a 
Œ 
they had a 
house at 
Œ 
in 
Bradley Beach
,
 
New Jersey
, in addition to living here, on 
[indecipherable]
 
Street
 
in 
Newark
. They had a house, and a small house in the 
back. Ma 
Œ 
the 
Œ  
my grandmother ha
-
had the 
Œ  
her house,
 
the families used to come 
down and
 
occupy the big house for weekends, and so forth. She did all the cooking, 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015

she did all the cleaning, she did everything herself. There were never any help. I 
don™t think any vi 
Œ  
any of the daughters or daughters
-
in
-
law even helped. All of 
that. And her career, her active, physical career, doing things like that, ended when 
one of her sons, one of my uncles, drove down to 
Bradley Beach
, and drives into 
the driveway, and there is this house in the back. She™s up on the roof nailing 

things. She™s almost 90 na
Œ  
90 at that time, well into her 80s, and she was nailing. 
And he said, Mom, Mom, come down from there, you know, don™t ever 
Œ 
and they 
prohibited her from doing anything like that. She deteriorated after that. But she 

was always regarded as a great, great lady. Without, again, the s 
Œ  
the reading 
Œ  
writing skills, and the reading, any of that 
Œ 
Q: Well, she kept the whole thing going.
 
A: She kept it all going.
 
She kept all 
Œ 
she kept staff, as
 
the workers 
Œ 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: 
Œ  
and family, all 
Œ 
all going.
 
Q: Th
at™s huge. That™s huge.
 
A: Yeah, she was 
Œ 
she was, in her way, a great woman. Yeah.
 
Q: What was her name?
 
A: 
Minnie
.

A:

A: Yes, mm
-
hm.
 
Q: Let™s go to your mom™s side. What do 
Œ  
what were your grandparents like there? 
Did you know them too?
 
A: Not as well, but most often, on Sundays, we traveled to 
Kearny
, 
which is where
 
the 
Kahns
, they™re 
k-a -h -n
, the grandparents, they lived on 
Chestnut 
Street. I 
almost 
Œ  
almost reme mber the number, but 
Chestnut 
Street in 
Kearny
. And that 
was our Sunday activity, we™d drive over. And 
Œ 
and she would always make 
French style chicken fricassee . She came  from 
France
. Chicken fricassee. And my 
mother could make that, too. And I used to talk to 
Shirley
 
a lot, sh 
Œ 
sh 
Œ  
about,
 
Shirl
, 
get the recipe, make chicken fricassee . She made her own version of it. Was 
Œ  
it was good, but not quite she same as 
Kear ny
 
gr 
Œ  
gr 
Œ 
Kearny
 
grandma made 
Œ 
Q: Yeah.

A: 
Œ y
ou know. So that was 
them, and I didn™t know 
wha 
Œ  
they were in the cattle 
business on farms, and all their sons were in the cattle  business, except one, 
A
-
Aaron
, who was in the milk business, in competition, in a sense, with my father. 
But he used to drive up to our house. I mentioned that I 
Œ 
I was born on 
South 
Orange
 
Avenue in 
Newark
. And fairly often wou 
Œ 
I would look out the window 
and see a horse drawn wagon, big milk 
Œ 
big bottle of milk painted on it, and all 
that. That was Uncle
 
Aaron
, would come by on his route, would come by, stop in 
and have a cup of coffee with us. And after, he became 
Œ 
no education, but there™s a 
painting in my bedroom that he did. After he retired from that activ ity, he became a 
painter, and did marvelous flower paintings, and all that. So, that was the 
Œ 
Q: Mother™s side.
 
A: 
Œ

Q: It™s really hard to imagine that 
New Jerse y 
would be cattle country, you know? 
It s
omehow doesn™
t fit the image that one has of the state .
 
A: No, but wa 
Œ 
Q: But those were the years.
 

A: It was. Actually though, the milk that my father sold came from upper 
New 
York
 
state.
 
Q: Oh, really?

A: 
Yeah, so farms up there. I think
 
these people were related somehow, to one of 
my uncles, and all. But they, every 
Œ 
every day, every day, the bi 
Œ  
the bi 
Œ 
the big 
deal at the dairy would be, oh, the traile r™s c oming, the trailer™s coming. This huge 
trailer would come from upper 
New York
 
sta te, and back
Œ  
back in
, 
and unloading, 
it was unloading all the milk, ca me from upper 
New York 
sta te.
 
Q: Did they process 
Œ 
A: Because the farm was gone from 
Irvington
, so they had to get it from a place 
upstate.
 
Q: Oh, I see. So, did they process the milk, too? Did t
hey 
Œ 
A: No.
 
Q: No. It was already 
Œ 

A: 
It was already bottled 
Œ 
Q: Okay.
 
A: 
Œ  
packaged, and yeah, they were not 
Œ 
I think I mentioned before, the br 
Œ 
the 
brothers were at odds with one another.
 
Q: It sounded like that. You didn™t say it direc tly, but it sounded like that.
 

A: Yeah, they didn™t 
Œ 
the 
Œ  
they didn™t, and so they weren™t progressive. My 
brother, again, back to my brother, on su
-
summers, he would work there at the 
dairy. And there was jealousy that went on, say he never 
Œ 
they never really gave
 

 
Interview with Robert Max

him much of a chance. They wa 
Œ 
the uncles were 
Œ 
were not kind, not particularly 
congenial toward him, and we 
Œ  
my brother and I talked later on, and said, if they 
Œ 
if they had, if the brothers had had the sense e nough to allow my brother and me to 
come
 
in, the next generation, and run the business, it would have been a successful 
business. But when you
 Œ  
when you have brothers in the business, a nd they spend a 
good part of their time arguing or fighting with one another, and who™s taking more 
vacation time, and tho 
Œ 
those kinds of things happen there. And unfortunately, it 
didn™t become a big business.
 
Q: Yeah. Well, you know, it also depends on 
Œ  
on the f 
Œ  
the 
Œ  
the previous 
generation from that too, you know. If your grandfather wasn™t really interested in 
making sure that things were divided equally, that kind of set things up too, 
sometime s.
 
A: Yes. Yeah.
 

Q: Okay, let™s move onto a few other things. This world that you describe, sounds 
actually like a lovely world, in 
Œ 
in 
New Jersey
 
at that time, y
ou know, of growing 
up with this large family, and 
Œ 
and a wonderful older brother, and 
Œ  
and warm 
parents, and so 
Œ 
at home, were discussions about what was going on in 
Europe
 
ever part of the conversation? I mean, the large things. When 
Hitler 
came to po
wer 
in 1933, you were 10 years old.

A: Mm
-
hm, mm
-
hm.
 
Q: Do you ever reme mber your parents, or anyone in the family making any 
remarks about that?
 
A: As I me ntioned earlier wa 
Œ 
that was one of the things that I reg retted; w e did not 
talk about world affa 
Œ 
affa 
Œ  
affairs. 
And 
I was not introduced to 
Œ 
to that until I 
was ol 
Œ 
a little older, and able to read the papers ma 
Œ 
myself. No, we didn™t talk a 
lot about what was going on in 
Europe
, and as I say, I wish 
Œ 
I wish we had done a 
little bit more of that
. 
Q: Was it 
Œ 
was there any talk anywhere? Like in school, or in your world? I guess 
I™m trying to get a sense of how did events that were going on in 
Germany
, when 
did they become part of at lea st so mething you were aware of?
 
A: It™s very vague with 
Œ 
in 
my mi 
Œ 
my memory, very vague. And the best I can 
think of, probably not until high school, til I got into high school, that I started to 
become interested in world affairs, sta rted to read newspapers re
-
regularly.
 
Q: Yeah, that would have been 
Œ 
A: And then I knew 
Œ 

Q: Yeah.
 
A: 
Œ  
what was going on. But I had to be, you know, 14, 15, 16.
 
Q: The war™s already starting in 
Europe
 
at that point.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
36
 
A: And it started, right.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: Right. So I didn™t know a great deal about it, until I s 
Œ  
as I say, I started 
rea ding 
my 
Œ  
on my own, in newspapers.
 
Q: Did you have a radio at home?
 
A: We did have radio. We listened to radio a great deal. I very often listened to 
Joe 

Œ  
Joe L
ouis
™ bouts. And oh, he was ama zing. I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I think about that, when people 
Œ  
when we talk
 
today about 
Œ 
when those days we didn™t have 
TV
. We certainly 
didn™t have computers and all that. What did you do? Well, we listened to radio. 

What 
Œ  
what 
Œ  
what 
Œ  
what did you see? We didn™t see. We saw in our own minds. 
And I 
Œ 
I fought every round with
 
Joe Louis
 
in those bouts, just liste ning on a big 
box radio
, and I could point 
Œ 
the announcers had to be very good, and they were. 
And I could really, really feel tha t I saw 
Louis
 
in those great bouts, in the 
Louis 
Œ  
Braddock 
Œ  
or mac 
Œ 
Max Baer
, 
Jimmy B
raddock
 
championship fight. Well, 
Max Baer
 
was our hero. Remember, he wore the Jewish star, and 
Œ 
and he was a 
braggadocios ki 
Œ 
kind of guy. Glamorous sor 
Œ 
sort of. And then defi 
Œ  
defeated by 
this small time boxer, really, from 
New Jersey
. But, liste ning on radio, it was 
Œ 
it 
was 
Œ  
it was very real, and we could see it 
Œ 
you know, we didn™t 
Œ  
listening now is 
quite different, because we ha 
Œ 
we™ve been exposed to 
TV
. But
, it
 
was real.

Q: This 
Œ 
sou
-
sound has a magical quality.
 
A: It has. It has. And 
even
 
ba
-
baseball games, except for one incident I remember, a 
baseball announcer 
Œ 
and you know, President 
Reagan
 
wa
-
wa
-
was a baseball a
-
announcer, sportscaster and all. But the 
Newark Bears
 
were the yank 
Œ 
New York 
Yankees 
fa rm tea m, 
A
 
number one farm tea m. T
hey had an announcer by the name 
of 
Earl Harper
. And I used to listen to baseball
Œ  
again, my 
Œ 
I 
mentioned my 
brother had really introduced me to baseball, maybe
 
a 
New York Yankee
. A
nd so I 
used to listen to the 
Yankee
 
game certainly, but I listened to th
e 
Newark Bears
 
games, too, and 
Earl Harper
 
was the announcer. They had to describe what was 
going on in the field, to gi 
Œ 
give you on 
Œ 
the only representation
 
you could get, 
what, litera lly, was happening. So I remember 
Earl Harper
, I
 
sit down, and I was
 
listening, he said, the si 
Œ 
the wind
-
up, the pitcher wind
-
up, the stretch, the pitch, 
and the
re goes a booming drive, going 
Œ 
look a 
Œ 
deep
, deep center field, and 
Œ 
and 
Œ  
and a 
Œ 
and 
Roy 
Schalk
 
steps back on the grass and takes it. 
Roy Schal
k
 
was 
second
 
baseman. So that description of 
t
his long, long drive going out to center 
field, was really caught by the second baseman, who just stepped back onto the 
grass, and all that. So sometimes you got vivid descriptions that weren™t very real. 
And they could co
lor them if they wanted to, and some of them did, or they could

ma
-
make errors, and sometime they did that too, but 
Œ 
but anyway, radio was real to 
us.
 
Q: And so, were there other types, non
-
sports programs that the family listened to?
 
A: Yeah, I think my mother had her
 
favorite morning drama 
Œ  
drama. So morning, 
when we™re cooking, preparing lunch, and preparing for the evening meal, there  
were 
Œ  
there were drama shows on radio, and she, I think, used to listen to those. I 
used to listen to a lot of music.
 
I became a musician. And I got fasc inated with Big 
Band Swing, which was the music of that era. So I liste ned to a great, great deal of 

that.
 

Q: What about December 7
th
, 1941?
 
A: Yeah. All I rememb er about that is the president™s speech, the da 
Œ  
the day 
aft 
Œ  
after.
 
Q: Radio?
 
A: On radio, yes.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: And on December 7
th
, that rich voice, December 7
th
, 1941, the day that will live 
in infamy. Yes.
 

Q: And was that of a 
Œ 
did you already know of it before the speech, or was this the 
first time you™re hea
ring?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
39
 
A: I must have known about it before, because I knew the two Japanese 
ambassadors, 
No
mura
, began with a 
C
, and an 
N
, and a 
C
, but the two Japanese 
were in the White House at the time. They knew the attack was coming, as it was 
reported later on,
 
and
 
they knew it, and they were negotiating with the president. 
So, it was really a dastardly, dastardly act. Their planes were already on the way to 
Pearl Harbor
, and they were still talking with the president of the 
United States
, 
in the White House.
 
Q: And 
you knew of this before his speech goes on. That is, people in the area 
would have known this already, or not? No.
 
A: No, I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I learned that afterwards.
 
Q: Afterwards, okay.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: I was trying to get a sense of 
Œ 
A: Yeah, no, I didn™t 
Œ 
Q: By talking about radio, I also wanted to get a sense of, how does the wider world 
come into a home? How does it 
Œ 
how does news of the wider world come in at that 
particular time?
 
A: Mm
-
hm, mm
-
hm. For wa 
Œ 
for wa 
Œ 
for one thing, we weren™t as alert, or 
interest
ed in the rest of the world, we had a literal enclaves that we lived in. And so, 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
40
 
we didn™t need the exposure that people need today, that we had. And so what 
Œ 
what we did get, on newscasts, wa s, you know, it was sufficient for us, at that time.
 

Q: Well, that™s important to know.
 
A: Mm
-
hm.
 
Q: That™s important to know. That™s a differe nce between today™s world, and 
Œ 
and 
Œ  
and the one 60, 70 years ago.
 
A: Oh, 
a 
very different world
, yes
. 
Q: Yeah. And one other question that I™ve got is background question. What kind of 
image did you have in your mind, of what 
Europe
 
was, based again, on family. 
Because most Americ ans, when they came, most Americans at tha t time , would not 
have been immigrants from the se cond or third generation, they would have been 
earlier, 
you know?
 
A: Mm
-
hm.
 
Q: And
 
Europe
 
is very distant. What was 
Œ 
how was
 
Europe
 
painted for you, given 
that your mother comes from western 
Europe
, and your father™s family came from 
eastern
 
Europe
? 
A: 
Even though they came from there, I had no 
Œ  
no knowledge 
really, of central 
Europe
, of eastern
 
Europe
. To me, 
Europe
 
was 
Paris
 
and 
London
, 
Spain
. Strictly 
the western 
Œ 
the 
nations in 
Europe
. But just 
Œ 
just 
Europe
 
seemed so distant. It 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
41
 
was another world. Today it™s very different, it™s in our 
Œ 
it™s in our back
yard, and 
you travel to it all the t ime. But it was very, very rare for anybody to travel even, to
 
Europe
. So, it didn™t play much of a role in our lives. Just a fa scination, something 
out there that™s very alluring to us, but we™d 
Œ 
we didn™t think, we didn™t travel the 
way people travel today. You wouldn™t think of traveling to 
Russia
, my gosh.
 
Q: Travel from 
Russia
. 
A: Somewheres, but 
Œ 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: 
Œ  
not there.
 
Q: Okay, so let™s go to December, after Dec ember 7
th
, 1941, the 
United States
 
is 
then involved
 
in a war, but it™s in the 
Pacific 
theate
r, not in the European theater.
 
A: Right.
 
Q: How does your life continue? You™re in high school at that time , is that correct?
 
A: Mm
-
hm, right.
 
Q: How were those last years of high school, and what 
Œ 
what was going 
on with 
you?
 
A: Well, obviously, I was aware that the Japanese had struck, and we were in a war 
in the 
Pacific
 
islands. It didn™t affect me very, very much, until, you know, four 
days later, December 11, 1941, that 
Adolf Hitler
 
declared war on 
America
. Now
 
it 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
42
 
was a different 
Œ 
different story. First of all, 
Hitler
,Naz i 
Œ  
Nazi 
Germany
, Jews, 
all of that began to register on me, as I 
Œ 
as I mentioned, I read newspapers
, 
so I 
knew what was going on. That
 
started to register. In 1941, I graduated high school, 
then 1942, headed for college.
 
Q: Where?
 
A: September of 1942, I guess that™s when it was. Pretty sure. And I was what, 19 at 

the time. Oh, I™m s 
Œ 
I™m sorry. My first year, I did not go to 
Ohio 
University. My 
first year wa 
Œ 
I went to 
New York
 
University.
 
It was convenient, I didn™t have to 
go traveling any place. I could just 
Œ 
oh, about a half mile from my home, I could 
get on a bus, and travel to 
Newark
, take a tra in into 
New York
, and I went to 
New 
York
 
University, the fi
-
first 
Œ  
first year. And that™s
 
when
 
I read newspapers a great 
deal, during 
Œ 
during travel to and from the city. And that™s when I 
Œ 
I knew what 
was going on, and 
Œ  
with Nazis. I knew the concentration camps were be 
Œ 
beginning, 
Hitler
™
s 
plan of the 
Œ  
his gru 
Œ  
his 
Œ  
his
 
book.
 
Q: 
ﬁMein
 
Kampf
.ﬂ
 
A: ﬁ
Mein Kampf
.ﬂ All of that, so I 
Œ 
I got really 
Œ  
so I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I knew what was going 
on. The reality is that I had to leave this area. I had terrible sinusitis, and the doctor 
said, you must get out of this area, because otherwise you™re going to have trouble 
breathing, constantly. Pick an area out in the Midwest. I had a classmate, who knew 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
43
 
I was ma 
Œ m-
ma joring in journalism,
 
had a c lassmate,
 
who told me about this 
lovely, little school, small town in 
Ohio
,
 
Athens
,
 
Ohio
. 
Ohio 
University. Was one 
of the top three journalism schools in the country.
 
Q: Wow.
 
A: And so, it 
Œ 
it was a  totally different way of life, na 
Œ 
going to 
Œ 
to college, on a 
ka 
Œ  
on a 
Œ 
a big, big, tall office like bi 
Œ 
building, was not my view of what college 
life ought to be. So, I didn™t need much persuasion to get out of town, and I 
Œ 
I went 
out there.
 
Q: Did it clear out the sinusitis?
 
A: Pardon?
 
Q: Did it clear out the sinusitis?
 
A: Yeah, I 
Œ 
yeah, it wasn™t 
Œ  
it wasn™t 
Œ 
wasn™t bad, I 
Œ 
I got 
Œ 
Q: So, was it the pollution h
ere?
 
A: Hm?
 
Q: What was the cause why here it was 
Œ 
A: Industry. Heavy, a lot of heavy, manufacturing industry.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: And so out there, it was all country, so that 
Œ 
that did help a great, great deal. So 
I was out there, I was now in my sophomore year, I™m 20 years old. I™m taking 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015

ROTC
, reserved officer training corps, at university. We™re in the war. I™m in a 
fraternity. We hold bull sessions at night. And here we are, a bunch of guys, age 

eligible to be in the war, and we 
Œ  
and we need bull sessions. We seem to 
subliminally maybe, impressing one another, that maybe that™s where we belong. 

Why should we 
Œ 
similar me
-
men, boys, are going over to fight. Why should we be 
here? And so most of us signed on. I volunteered to go in the army, and did.
 
Q: Did 
you finish your sophomore year?
 
A: Yes. They allowed us to finish the year, and then I went off to the 
Œ 
to f 
Œ 
Fort 
Dix
 
in 
New Jersey
, the reception center.
 
Q: And this would have been what 
Œ 
what year, what summer, or what 
Œ 
A: That would have been the 
Œ 
that would have been 1940 
Œ 
Q: Three?
 
A: 
Œ  
two? No? Was maybe 
Œ  
maybe summer of ™42? Who ma 
Œ 
no, ™41, ™42? No, I 
think we may have been in ™43 already. I™m very vague on that.
 
Q: That™s okay.
 
A: I don™t remember.
 
Q: Okay.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
45
 
A: The dates or the timing, but I finished a year, so it would have been in the fall of 
™42, I finished that year, a second year. And then maybe that™s 
Œ 
that™s when I 
Œ 
I 
went in.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: So I 
Œ  
again, I had volunteered, was sent to 
Fort Dix
. 
Q: So you were close to home?
 
A: Very close to home. But that was just 
Œ 
just the reception center. From there you 
go out for basic training.
 
Q: Where was that?
 
A: 
Fort Dix
. 
Q: No, no, no, where was basic training
 
A: Oh, well that come a little  bit later.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: I 
Œ  
I actually was in 
Alabam
a
. 
Q: Oh, wow.
 

A: 
Fort McClellan
, 
Alabama
. Also known as the hellhole of the south. But 
anyway, when I got to 
Œ 
Q: Was it?
 
A: Huh?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
46
 
Q: Was it?
 
A: I 
Œ  
no, I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I regarded it highly, it was a 
Œ  
it was 
Œ  
it helped save my life. It 
was re 
Œ 
very, very rugged
 
training, and I was put in very good physical, and I think 
emotional shape there. But no 
Œ  
the 
Œ  
of note, when I got to 
Fort Dix
, I was called 
into the office, and there was a 
Œ 
a man leading the music. And you know, they had 
a band, a swing band, and his
 
name was 
Jack Leonard
. He had been with the 
Tommy Dorsey
 
orchestra. He preceded 
Frank Sinatra
 
as the vocalist for that 
orchestra. So he 
Œ  
like ma 
Œ 
like so many of the musa 
Œ 
musicians, so many, many 
of them, the bandleaders and all, they all volunteered,
 
and went in the service.
 
Glenn Miller
, you know what happened to him.
 
Q: Mm
-
hm. What happened to 
Glenn Miller
, so the people will understand. What 
happened to him?
 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 
Glenn Miller
, of course, had probably the most 
Œ 
certainly one 
of the most popular bands. We called them swing bands, dance bands. They had one 
of the most popular ones, had a unique sound, that he created for his orchestra. And 
he 
Œ  
I believe he volunteered. He became a c aptain, then a major, an d he was 
leading 
Œ  
he had a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a World War II band, a counterpart of what he had in 
civilian life . And they played some of the same music , again. And he used to travel 

to the bases, where the troops were, overseas, and play concerts, jazz co 
Œ 
swing

concerts for them.
 
Gle nn Miller
 
dis
appeared in a flight from 
Great Britain
, over to 
Normandy
. They never, never di 
Œ  
were 
Œ  
never discovered, what happened. He 
Œ 
he was off, they were going over to 
France
 
to entertain the troops, and the plane 
disappeared. And there are many, many stories and beliefs as to how it disappeared, 
but somewhere over the English channel, 
Glenn Miller 
Œ 

Q: Disappeared.
 

A: 
Œ  
was hit, and was 
Œ 
and disappear 
Œ 
dis
-
disappeared. But my experience in the 
Œ 
in music, some of the 
Œ 
some of the members may have been from his band, too, but 
I 
Œ  
when I ca 
Œ 
when I came 
Œ 
oh, I didn™t 
Œ  
didn™t tell you how I got to be there. I 
Œ
I 
played in local bands here. So I played clarinet and saxophone. So I get there, and 
I™m ca lled into the office. And they tell me that 
Jack Leonard 
wo
uld like to see 
you. I says, 
why would
 
he want to see me ? So I went to him. He sa id, kid, I see you 
play saxophone, clarinet. How could he know that? We didn™t have computers in 

those days, how did he know? Somehow it was on my record that I had been 
playi
ng with bands. He said, I 
Œ 
I™m going to give you a weekend pass. I want you 
to come play in the 
Œ  
play wi 
Œ 
in the band here. And he give me a weekend pass. 
Go back to 
South Orange
, come back with your instruments. And I did. It was a 
totally different life. No more 
KP
. I didn™t have to even make my bed. Every 
Œ 
everything was cared for me. I wa s now a musician amo ng the elite, I guess. All I

I didn™t have any chores, no potato peeling, nothing. AndI practiced in the morning, 
went to
 
rehearsal. We reh
ea
rsed in the afternoon. We would
 
broadcast on radio at 
night.
 
Q: Live?
 
A: It was a great life. Huh?
 
Q: Live?
 
A: Live, yes, live broadcasts, and I 
Œ 
it was a s great a life as anybody could 
imagine. I me 
Œ 
war™s going on, here I a m playing music here. I ca n p
lay 
Œ  
I could 
possibly play 
Œ 
play the rest of the  war, just sitting there, and playing with 
musicians. I was intimidated, in a way. I looked around me 
Œ 
cause I 
Œ  
I used to 
follow these big bands, and I knew
Œ  
I knew who the 
Œ  
who the 
Œ  
the side me n 
were.
 
And these were not musicians, frankly, like today™s musicians. They were 
trained in 
Juilliard
, and places like that. They could orchestrate, arrange, compose. 
So they were great musicians, the best of their day. And there I am sitting with 

them, and trying to keep place with them. The very first number we play was a 
number from 
Benny g 
Œ  
Benny Goodman 
orchestra created, calle d ﬁ
Six Flats 
Unfurnished
.ﬂ
 
That means the music is written in the 
Œ 
in six flats, and six flats, it 
makes it to ugher to play. And here I am, sitting with all these great musicians, and

playing a tough piece. And oh, tha
-
that was 
Œ 
that was 
Œ 
th
at was difficult. At any 
rate, that
 
went on. Could have 
Œ  
could have remained.
 
Q: How long did it go on?
 
A: I don™t think more than maybe a few w
eeks.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: It could have been a great life. I think I could have spent probably the entire war 
playing music. My name ca me up to be shipped out for basic training. 
Jack 
Leonard 
intervenes, and gets the name stripped off. And I say, 
Jack 
[indecipherable]
 
he said. I said, I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
Jack
, I 
Œ  
I do want to g 
Œ  
want to go 
Œ 
yeah, 
I™m 
Œ  
I™m in the army, I™m 20 years old. I just can™t imagine 
Œ 
I don™t say to him, 
but I can™t imagine that I™m going to spend the war here. I know many of my peep 
Œ 

my age, are going overseas, and they™re 
Œ 
some of them probably losing their lives 
[indecipherable]
 
and
 
whatever. But my place is not here, it™s there. So I say,
 
Jack
, 
I want to go out 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I want to 
Œ  
I want to go on the list a gain. I said, I™ll go out, and 
you know,
 
eventually I™ll come back here. He said, kid, you leave here, you™re 
never coming back again. And he was right, of course. I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I couldn™t dictate  to 
the army where I go . But so 
Œ 
so that was it, and I 
Œ 
I left the band. He took care of 
shipping my ins
truments back to 
South Orange
, and I was off, basic tra ining.
 
Q: To 
Alabama
. 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015

A: 
Alabama
, yes.
 
Q: Well, what time do we have right now? Then, why don™t we break at this point.
 
A: Oh, good. Okay. 
[break]
 
Q: Okay. So, before the break, we were talking about your first days and weeks in 
the military, and how you were in this wonderful band, but that you did not feel 

right staying at it, and asked that your name be put on the list to be called up for 

basic training. Take us from there. Tell us where you went, and what this training 
involved.
 
A: Well, so shortly after I made that determination, that I was 
Œ 
I was ready, I 
Œ 
I 
wanted army life, I was put a 
Œ 
placed on an or 
Œ 
a shipping order, to be shipped 
out. And we took a very circuitous route. I don™t know why
 
in 
America
, they felt 
there may be threats, a nd we didn™t go directly down to 
Alabama
, but sort of 
weaved 
Œ  
weaved around. And I was told it was for security purposes. But we got to 
Fort McClellan
, deep into 
Alabama
. And immediately I knew that I was goin
g to 
have a very, very hot summer. T e mperatures at 
Fort McClellan
 
in 
Alabama
, rose 
at times to over a hundred degrees.
 
Q: Oh my.
 
A: So, it was a very, very hot, difficult summer. But was a 
Œ 
it wa s a standard 
training camp. What 
Œ 
what 
Œ  
one of the difficulties we had was that it was staffed 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
51
 
by what we called cadre,
 c-a -d -r-e
, cadre. These are old
-
time army men who have 
been through the wars. And here was a bunch of young, college, smart
-
a leck kids 
coming down. They were not going to let us get away with an
 
easy training period. 
Training was three mo nths. They gave us the most diffic ult forced marches. One of 
the 
Œ  
one of the ultimate requirements was that we marc h, fully loaded with 
equipment, backpacks, and all 
Œ 
all th 
Œ 
and all the 
Œ  
the equipment that we would 
normally carry into battle. And we ru 
Œ 
march over 
Bain Gap
. 
Bain Gap
 
was a 
very, very hilly mountain. And some had trouble making it. Certainly in the 
Œ 
in the 
hot temperatures in which we were marching. We did it. I think just not everybody 

made 
Œ  
ma de the marc h. That irritated them, and they said, you™re going back, 
you™re going to do it again. And they made us march over 
Bain Gap
, twice.
 

Q: The same day?
 
A: No, no, no, no, we di 
Œ  
different dates.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: But the 
Œ  
us
-
usually part of the tra
ining was for building your endurance, your 
ability to survive in combat, where you have to do forced marches. But because we 

all made it, they 
Œ 
you know, thi
-
this was emotional, more 
Œ 
more 
than tactical. So, 
you got to march again, so we had to go over 
it again. The obstacle courses they set 

up for us, were very, very difficult. Yeah, you™re climbing walls out of 
Œ 
you 
Œ 
you 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
52
 
run, cl 
Œ 
pull yourself on a rope, and go over. And jump over ponds, and you had to 
jump far enough, otherwise you landed in the water. Rather tough exercises. So they 
put us through a very strenuous program. I believe at that time I 
Œ 
oh, I 
Œ 
I was a 
physical en
-
enthusiast. I took the 
Charles Atlas
 
bodybuilding course, because I was 
very small, and I had to build up 
Œ  
if I was small 
Œ 
I ma y be small in stature, but I 
will not be small in body and strength. So I took the 
Charles Atlas
 
bodybuilding 
course, which was very popular at that time . So I had some things going for me 
already. That, plus the training that we got at 
F ort McClella
n
, I 
Œ  
I think, to a large 
extent, saved my life la ter 
Œ  
later on. One of the difficult things that also happened 
at 
Fort McClellan
, is that it was a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
it was a cu 
Œ  
a prisoner of war camp for 
German soldiers. And I didn™t know, but they apparently, wh en they were captured 
overseas, some of them were sent over here, to s 
Œ 
to 
POW  
camps. 
Fort McClellan
 
was a 
POW
 
camp. Now, their treatment of prisoners 
Œ 
our treatme nt of prisoners, I 
should say, as opposed to theirs, very, very different. They 
Œ 
as we were marching 
on
 
the
-
these 
Œ  
these tough 
Œ  
these obstacle courses, the marches, th ey would stand 
in the fenced
-
in area, laughing at us, because we were being 
Œ 
we were the ones 
who were being pushed, and they were living a 
Œ 
a wonderful life. They were 
bronze
d. You know, they had no shirts, and they were absorbing the sun. They 
didn™t have to march in the sun, they just absorbed it. They had the rights to go to 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
53
 
the post exchange, where they could get cigarettes, candy, any 
Œ 
anything that was 
available. They w
ere living wonderful lives, a nd there they were, ridiculing us, and 
laughing 
Œ  
laughing at us. And so in 
Œ 
as I write, later on, I say, hm, but look at how 
things turned out. The guy they were laughing at, turns out to have survived, and 
many of them, I™m sure, did not. That was compensation. So 
Fort McClellan
, 

again, was very difficult, but it did prepare us well for what lie ahead, and 
Œ 
lay 
ahead. And then, after three months 
Œ 
Q: How long did that last? T hree months?
 
A:What?
 
Q: Three months?
 
A: We™ve had three months there, and really, it was a wa 
Œ  
it was a very good, a ver 
Œ  
very good life. On Sunday mornings, we were pretty free, to do what 
Œ 
we could 
Œ 
we could go to the mess hall, and order up 
Œ  
what we used to order 
Œ 
to get at home. 
On Sunday mor
ning, get breakfast. I used to be able to go up and tell the chef 
Œ 
I 
don™t think we called them chef, we called them cooks, but I could tell him I wanted 
eggs, bacon, toast on the side, yeah. Yeah. And we were getting that. And this was 

army life? My gosh
. It was a tough, tough camp, but sa 
Œ 
some of the relief on 
Œ 
on 
Œ  
on Sundays, made it palatable. The heat was so great, that it was not uncommon 
for people to pass out on the parade ground, when we were being marched, and all 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
54
 
that. And the only time in my life  that I ever came about as close a s you can get to 
passing out, I 
Œ  
I sustained myself. Hundred degree temperatures, sun pouring 
down, and we™re standing out in that sun, and we™re marching and marching. And I 
Œ  
I felt weakness, and I 
Œ 
I just didn™t
 
want to drop out. I reme mber getting to the 
barracks, to the steps, and fine 
Œ 
just about making the few steps I had to my bed, 
and then throwing myself on my bed. But had the great satisfaction that I didn™t 
pass out on the parade ground. So again, very,
 
very good, good basic training. 
Tough but good, at 
Fort McClellan
. 
Q: And after three months, what happened?
 
A: Then we moved on. The army developed a 
Œ  
a program they called the Army 
Specialized Training Program. It was to train
 
soldiers, those who had some college 
education 
Œ 
I believe that was the criteria that was used, you 
Œ  
you had to have 
some education. You were being trained in one or two schools, either engineering 
Œ  
they always needed engineers, or foreign languages. Foreign languages would have
 
been much more appropriate for me, because the last thing I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I was in 
Œ 
I was 
Œ  
had any talent for, was engineering. That™s the way the army
 
did things, though. 
They always wanted to train you the army way, not some habit you might have 
picked up in 
civilian life. And so, because I knew nothing about engineering, that™s 
the school I went to. So, from 
F ort McClellan
, I went to 
Alabama
 
Polytechnic 

 
Interview with Robert Max

Institute
. Later became 
Auburn University
. We had a campus life, we 
Œ 
we lived 
in dorms on the campus. We still had marching drills, but we had classroom studies.
 
Q: Was this training to be an officer as well, or 
Œ 
or was that still part of being a 
private?
 
A: That came later on, when we 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
when we tried to go to officer candidate 
school.
 
Q: Okay
. 
A: I™ll come to that in a 
Œ 

Q: Okay.
 
A: 
Œ  
in a few minutes. Because it all sta rted where we 
Œ 
where we™re at now 
Œ 
Q: Okay.
 
A: 
Œ  
at 
Auburn University
. We 
Œ 
so we attended class. We didn™t 
Œ 
we di 
Œ  
did 
milita ry drills, and 
Œ 
and got some lectures on military stuff. But we attended class. 
The 
Œ  
they had to reach far and wide to get in st 
Œ 
enough instructors for those 
programs. And I reme mber the instructor I had in engineering, was an English tea 
Œ 

professor in college. So, he was only a few pages ahead of us. And some of the guys 

who I was with, were really engineering oriented people, and they were being held 
back. For me it was o 
Œ 
okay, cause I knew nothing about engineering, but that™s the 
way they did things. We 
Œ 
so, in addition to our studies, we had our weeke
nds 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
56
 
reasonably free. There were four of us from the 
New York
 
area, people 
Œ 
people 
that I knew, and we formed a 
Œ 
a group 
Œ 
like, we 
Œ  
we were what was a 
Œ 
musical 
promotors. We 
Œ 
on Saturday nights, we would have concerts. What were the 
concerts? The big bands of the day were the 
Œ 
we had a
-
all on record, in my 
dormitory room, and we would invite everybody in, we™d have drinks and 
Œ 
and 
Œ  
and 
Œ 
Q: Play music.
 
A: 
Œ  
was just 
Œ 
huh? Music, we had music. And I reme mber the kickoff 
Œ 
I think it 
was the kickoff concert we had, was 
Œ 
we called it an awa 
Œ 
it 
Œ  
it was the bu 
Œ 
the 
Œ  
the 
Œ  
the 
Œ  
the finest black musicians of their day. And there were many, many, 
really some  of the top, top musicians. And we had all them, you know, 
Count 
Basie
, 
Duke Eli
-
Ellington
, 
El
la Fitzgerald
. You know, all the grea t, great artists. 
And 
Œ  
and that was all records, so people poured into the dormitory. So that was our 
Œ  
our release, our relief from the pressures we  were under.
 
Q: Here™s a question. You grew up in 
Newark
 
in a mixe d community. It wasn™t just 
Jewish, it was also Gentile, it wa s also different ethnic groups, and so on. What 

about army life? Were there 
Œ 
was 
Œ  
did you get exposed to people, and populations 
and different kinds of young guys that you never would have met ot
herwise, and 
were they 
Œ 
how was that for you, and describe that a little bit.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
57
 
A: Yes, because the people 
Œ 
th
-
those who 
Œ 
those of us that they brought together 
were from all parts of the country, and so obviously we met new acquaintances, 
who became some
 
of the 
Œ 
who became buddies, and friends. And enemies, to o. 
The reason I knew that the 
Œ 
when I say enemies 
Œ 
the reason I knew that we were 
Œ 
that I had gotten some real good out of the training at 
Fort McClellan
, 
was that 
while we were there, we had one
 
guy, he was about 
Œ 
he was over six feet tall, well 
built, and all that. And he was too 
Œ 
I don™t remember what we called him, but too 
G
.
I
. He 
Œ 
he 
Œ  
he fa 
Œ 
every 
Œ  
everything 
Œ  
the script 
Œ 
you had to be right, 
milita rily do this right, march right, you
 
know, everything like that. And it bothered 
the other guys. I mean, we were normal 
Œ 
normal boys, you know, thrown into army 
lif
e, and he was very militaristic, a nd he got on their nerves. And one day, I 
Œ 
we 
got into an argument, and I just was determine
d on ma 
Œ 
I™m many inches shorter 
than he, I™m lots smaller, lighter in weight, but I™m going to take this guy on. And I 

did, and I beat him. You know, wrestling, and stren 
Œ 
very strenuous wrestling, and 
I brought him down. And 
Œ  
and 
Œ  
and the 
Œ  
and the guys cheered, you know, and 
Œ  
and it helped build relationships. I reme mber his name, 
Bob 
Œ  
Bob Loring
(ph)
. 
And I reme mber that. But the 
Œ  
anyway, so our experience there was interest
ing, but 
it was going nowhere. The battle losses in 
Europe
 
were becoming v
ery heavy.

Q: So 
Œ  
excuse me 
[coughing][break]
 
So was this after 
D -
Day
? You were still in 
Alabama 
when 
Normandy 
was 
Œ  
you know, after 
D -
Day
 
on 
Normandy
? 
A: June 
Œ  
that was June 6
th
, 1944.
 
Q: Forty
-
four, yeah.
 
A: Four 
Œ 
no, I think 
Œ 
I think on the landing 
Œ  
oh yeah, it had to be 
Œ 
yes, it had to 
be after the landing, because our troops had 
Œ 
had landed, and they were engaged in 
battle, acro 
Œ  
acro 
Œ  
across 
France
, and all that, and our losses. Even though we 
moved rapidly 
Œ  
the British and American forces did move rapidly after 
Œ  
they were 
bogged down in 
Saint
-
Lô
. 
And then after they broke out of there, and then they 
moved right across. But the 
Œ 
in doing so, the losses were heavy, and with those 
losses building up, the army looked at programs like 
ASTP
, and
 
said, we have to 
abandon them, because we need ground troops overseas. So they did. And we were 
Œ 

Q: 
AST
P
 
was your engineering school
. 
A: Engineering school, American special 
Œ 
Army Specialized Training Program. 
The navy had a counterpart to that. The 
Œs
o that program was to be abandoned, and 
we were going to go into the infantry. That didn™t sound very glamorous, so a whole 
bunch of us applied in two directions; one, to officer candidate school. Now, we 
Œ 
we didn™t know at the time, if you 
Œ  
if you go to
 
officer candidate sc hool, you 

 
Interview with Robert Max

graduate, you become a lieutenant, a let 
Œ 
lieutenant™s place was at th e front, not in 
the back. If you were a major, you could be in the back, but as a lieutenant, you 
were more exposed than anybody else. But we just liked the idea. I did, anyway. I 
wanted to become an officer. And I always had 
Œ 
had second thoughts about that, 
because I was small. I wanted to be good. And I was so young. By this time, I was 
21. And I said, many of the people I will be le ading, though, many of these guys, 

they™re going to be older than I, they™re going to be bigger than I, and I 
Œ 
can I 
command their respect? It was 
Œ 
there were doubts that I had.
 
But nevertheless, 
rather than fight in the 
Œ  
in the ground 
Œ 
ground 
Œ  
in the
 
ground troops, it wo
uld be 
nice to be an officer. And the other thing that we went for, air ca  
Œ 
air cadet 
Œ 
the air 
cadet academy in 
Œ 
it was in 
Œ 
in 
Georgia
. We a 
Œ  
I just became fascinated, a nd 
most of us did, with aircraft
. Like, you wouldn™t have to be on the ground, and
 
in 
the mud, and all that, you™d be flying in the air. You know, like it was a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
an 
easy job. It certainly wasn™t. The dangers that they were exposed to were as bad as 
anything on the ground. But anyway, a whole group of us applied for both. I 
reme mber
 
going to the interview for a 
Œ 
for a 
Œ 
to become an officer. It was the 
most austere setting I c an ever, ever reme mber. I walk into this room, and all I see is 
a long, long table, as far as I can see, of men sitting. Brass, all offic ers, high
-
ranking 

 
Interview with Robert Max

offi
cers. I™d  never seen so much brass in my 
Œ 
in my life. And not a smile on 
anyone™s fa ce.
 
Q: Oh gosh.
 
A: And I had to be interviewed by them. I™m 20 
Œ  
you know, 21 years old, 
I 
had 
never been subjected to anything like that. It was grueling, but I think I d
id well, 

and I think everybody thought they did well enough. On the 
Œ 
then we had to take 
written exams. We never did find out how we did on the written exams. During that 
same time , I don™t rem
-
reme mber who was there before or after, we applied to 
Œ  
to 
go
 
to air 
Œ  
the air academy and become fliers. So we did the same thing there, appli 
Œ  
applied there. In each 
Œ 
oh, and 
Œ 
and we became so infatuated with aircraft, that 
we s 
Œ 
instead of doing our studies at 
ASTP
, at night we™d run through the halls, 
flying
 
like planes. You know, we™re young guys still, we™re 
Œ 
we™re airplanes now. 
And we learned the silhouettes of every plane. We could identify every American 
and every German plane. Which was important to know, whether it™s your enemy 
coming at you, or one 
of your 
Œ 
Q: One of yours.
 
A: 
Œ  
or one of your 
Œ  
one of your 
own. So, w
-
we 
Œ  
we were all air
-
minded by that 
time. We were all ready to go off to the
 
air. As it turned out, because of the huge

sent on our way. We went to 
Œ 
oh, oh, for 
Œ  
for 
Œ  
for more 
Œ 
now, combat training, 
first was ba sic training, combat tra ining, so I then 
Œ  
I was sent to 
Œ 
to 
Indiana
, 
Camp Atterbury
 
in 
Œ  
near 
Indianapolis
, in 
Indiana
. And there were got com
bat 
training. I learned to be able to, in the dark, strip down my 
Œ 
strip down and put 
together my rifle. You had to be ab 
Œ 
you had to be able to do that, because who 
know 
Œ  
under battle conditions, it may be nighttime, and yet your battle 
Œ 
your 
Œ  
your r
ifle was your best friend in combat. If you were without that, you were in 
trouble. So we learned to do that. But one of the things that the army did again, as 
they did with 
ASTP
, they assigned you to units in which you had no experience. I 
was assig
ned to
 
the motor pool. I knew not
 
much more about an automobile engine
 
than the fact that 
Œ 
I knew there was a carburetor, I knew there were spark plugs, 
and I knew somewhere, something created a spark, and that ignited the gasoline, 

and that created the power. That™s all I knew, but I 
Œ 
about wha 
Œ 
what was under 
the hood,
 
I never had any experience with. So I™m assigned to the motor pool. So in 
addition to ki 
Œ  
getting combat tra ining, I got training in mechanics, and that. And 
so that 
Œ  
that™s what I did for a
 
very, very short time. Again, they had to abbreviate 
it, because we™re now needed overseas. So I shipped out of there.
 
Q: When?
 
A:Oh, 
I just don™t remember whe
-
when it was.

Q: Was it the fall of ™44?
 
A: Fall of ™44?
 
Q: Mm
-
hm.
 
A: 
Forty four? 
Probably so. Probably so. See, I landed on 
Omaha Beach
 
in 
September 
Œ  
let me se e, the initia l landing was 19 
Œ 
Q: Forty
-
four?
 
A: 
Œ  
44.
 
Q: June. So three months later.
 
A: June, for 
Œ 
three months exactly. Three months later, in September, when I 
landed on 
Omaha Beach
. B
ut 
Œ  
so we were 
Œ 
we were shipped out.
 
Q: Direct from the 
States
, or through 
England
, through the 
U
.
K
.?
 
A: No, to
 
the 
U
.
K
. We shipped out from 
Fort Mead
e
, 
Maryland
, and sailed on the 
Œ  
oh dear, dear 
Œ 
a bri 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a British luxury line 
Œ 
liner. Which was an
 
indication of 
how everybody, everybody, every business, e very everything 
Œ 
everything was 
devoted to the war. 
General Motors
 
stopped making automobiles, they made tanks, 
instead. The luxury bo
-
bo
-
boats were converted into troop carriers, and so I was on 
t
his luxury troop carrier. We saile d overseas, and landed in 
Œ 
landing in 
Liverpool
. 
When we got to liver 
Œ 
to 
Liverpool
, that was just a weigh station, waiting to take 
us across the English channel. We made it to 
Liverpool
, and I remember standing 

 
Interview with Robert Max

63
 
up on th
e deck and looking down, and there were people holding newspapers, 
s 
Œ  
Mauritania
,the 
SS
 
Mauritania
, which what we
 
saile d on, 
SS Mauritania
 
sunk. 
Well, there 
Œ  
there were Nazi submarines all across the 
Atlantic
, and the navigators 
on those ships had to we
ave their way across to try to avoi
-
void them. Many of our 
tr 
Œ  
many of our supply carrier ships were 
Œ 
were 
Œ  
were bombed, wa
-
was 
Œ  
were 
Œ  
were destroyed in the 
Atlantic 
O
cean, never getting overseas. And some troop 
carriers were hit. But anyway, we get there, and th
-
the paper said, 
Mauritania 
sunk. And we™re looking down, we™re here. So we trained a little bit more.
 
Q: So that meant you had been on the 
Mauritania
 
before it was sunk?
 
A: No, it wasn™t sunk.
 
Q: It wasn™t sunk, okay.
 
A: It was just a false re
port.
 
Q: Oh, I see.
 

A: And the 
Œ  
this news reporter thought he had a 
Œ  
a super story, you know, a 
scoop.
 
Q: Scoop.
 
A: And there were to defy his sc oop. So, we did land, and we trained a li
-
little  bit 
more in 
Liverpool
, and then set sail on a 
L
iberty
 
ship, 
across the English channel. 
Now, we were to link up with units we were going to battle with 
Œ 
that we were 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
64
 
going to battle for 
Œ 
with. And sailing across the English channel was not a simp
le 
thing. You started off in a 
L
iberty
 
ship, which is a very small, small version of 
these large, bi
-
big ocean liners. Started off in one of those. But to get to shore, you 
had to go 
Œ  
you had to descend from that ship, to a
n  
LST
, yeah, a landing ship tank. 
There was different versions of that, they were called different names, but I think 
the one we were on was an 
LST
. And you probably have seen pictures of landing 

troops during 
D -
Day 
Œ 
Q: Right.
 

A: 
Œ  
those 
Œ  
those little boats that came into shore, as close as they could get, then 
these big doors come down.
 
Q: Correct.
 

A:
 
And then the soldiers are off, into the water. St 
Œ 
the big 
Œ  
the 
most difficult part 
of that trip was fir
-
fir
-
first of all recognizing, you know, now 
Œ 
now, this is for real, 
because you 
Œ 
you 
Œ  
your 
Œ  
you™re di 
Œ 
you™re going to face the enemy pretty so
on. 
Now you have gas masks, rifles on 
Œ 
on your 
Œ  
on your shoulders, and on your 
back. And so this is 
Œ 
this is combat. The treacherous part of that trip was the 
exchange you made from the liberty ship, down to the 
LST
, because you had to 
climb down on a n
et. And we were warned in advance, one false step, and it may 

mean your life. So you had to place each foot perfectly. We had about 30 pounds of 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
65
 
equipment on our backs; rifles, ga s masks, everything we would carry into battle. 
So, you had to si 
Œ 
watch your step. I was very, very careful. Some did not make it. 
I heard stories about many on 
D -
Day
 
who slipped and fell between the ships. Now, 
the little ship is bobbing, and there 
Œ 
the two ships are crashing together. Some were 
crushed before they ever even got to shore. So I climbed down cautiously, and got 

into the ship. Now, for some strange reason, this 
Œ 
I mentioned earlier, this group 
with me at 
Œ  
that ran the concerts, the 
Œ  
one of them was with me yet. He turned out 
later in life  to be in adver 
Œ 
an advertising executive for one of the big advertising 
firms in 
New York
. But he wa 
Œ  
he was that kind of a person. For some reason he 
bought a camera, he brought a camera. We™re going into combat, and 
Herb
 
has a 
camera
. And he says,
 
Bob
, tell you what to do. A
s soon as that door goes down, I™m 
going to be right up front, I™m going to get off first, and then I want you to come 

out, and I™m going to take a picture of you landing on 
Omaha Beach
. And he did. 

He got a 
Œ 
and the 
Œ  
and the door goes down, you know. An
d this 
Œ 
this is cra z y, 
really crazy thi
-
thinking, to begin with. You™re going into combat, maybe just hours 
away from the enemy, and you™re taking a photograph. Anyway, 
Herb
 
did take that 
photograph. I never did see it. Along the way, we separated, he went to another unit, 
and 
Œ  
and I saw him in
 
New York
 
after the war, and 
Herb 
Œ  
he was with a big 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
66
 
advertising company. But he 
Œ 
he said, I don™t know what happened 
Bob
, but I lost 
it. Oh, terrible. But 
Œ 
Q: But you know, it™s a lso, you™re soldiers, but you™re
 
also kids.
 
A: We still 
Œ 
Q: You know, this is a 
Œ  
this is something that a 
Œ 
kids will do, because 
Œ 
A: You™re so right.
 

Q: Yeah, they™re so adventurous.
 
A: We were not 
Œ 
we were not yet mature soldiers. It would take a little se asoning, 
under ca 
Œ 
under 
combat conditions, for us to wise up to what it was all about. And 
that, as a matter of fact, was characteristic of my early days in combat. I still did not 

recognize that this is a  very serious business.
 
But anyway, I was assigned to the six 
Œ  
sixth armored, and we did land, climbed that route up in the mountains. Enemy 
fire was not too far away. I was assigned to the Sixth Armored Infantry Division. 
We rode half
-
tracks.
 
Q: What™s that?
 
A: Half
-
tracks are 
Œ 
are vehicles that have 
Œ  
they have an area 
Œ 
ther
e™s the 
Œ 
the 
driver™s ca 
Œ 
ca 
Œ  
ca 
Œ  
cabin. Next to the driver sits the officer in charge, and the 
driver 
Œ  
and then there™s an ope 
Œ  
big open area, wall 
Œ 
sides 
on 
Œ  
on the thing,
 
but 
it™s open on the top, and there are benches on each side. Anywhere from four to 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
67
 
eight 
Œ  
eight, four on each side, would sit in that. The back end had tracks, just like 
Œ  
like a 
Œ 
a 
Œ 
Q: A tank.
 
A: 
Œ  
a tanks. They had those kind of tracks, and wheels in the front. But the tracks 
to give tr
-
traction, and the wheels to be able to guide and make quicker turns than a 
tank could make. And that was our 
Œ 
that was our home. That™s wha 
Œ 
where we 
fought from.
 
Q: Oh, wow.
 
A: Until they
 
became obsolescent. And I™ll e xplain that in a 
Œ 
in a 
Œ 
in a moment. 
But anyway, there we were, and we were assi 
Œ 
and I 
Œ  
I was assig ned to that 
Œ 
to 
A
 
company in tha 
Œ  
in a platoon, and 
Œ  
and to that half
-
track. First days in combat, it 
was, you know, it was still 
Œ 
still not real yet.
 
Q: This was still in 
France
, though?
 
A: We™re 
Œ 
we™re in 
France
 
now.
 
Now we™re driving across 
France
 
to engage the 
enemy. We 
Œ  
the first day in camp, we are shelled by enemy forces. And those 
shells come  over. It™s a  frightening feeling, but I still 
Œ 
still, it didn™t register on me 
yet, because they 
Œ 
they passed over 
Œt
he ones you hear are okay, the 
Œ 
you know, 
they pass 
Œ 
they passed you. The ones that hit you are the ones you don™t hear. You 
don™t hear the ones that hit you, because that 
Œ  
that sound passing overhead
 
doesn™t 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
68
 
get there. They 
Œ  
they come right at you
. An
yway, those shells were passing 
overhead. We had a ca 
Œ 
a few in our half
-
track who had fought in the north African 
campaign
, they were used to this. And they knew when shells come in, that™s 
dangerous. And they jumped 
Œ 
dropped to the floor, and I 
Œ 
I loo
ked, and I 
wondered why. Well, th
-
they 
Œ  
they knew what 
Œ 
the seriousness of it. I still didn™t 
know. We 
Œ 
there were some German soldiers came  out of the woods, they were gi
-
gi
-
giving up, with their hands up, threw their rifles away. And we had a machine
-
gunner on our vehicle who was firing at them. And I yelled, we all yelled, stop, 
stop, they™re surrendering. And so other troops, other American troops came by, 

took them away, and we continued the 
Œ 
the 
Œ  
we were a
-a-
approaching enemy 
terri
-
te rritory, and
 
shells started to come in. The last plac e you want to be in
a 
half
-
track is on a road that™s zeroed in by en
-
enemy heavy artillery. And so we pulled it 
off the road. Now, we™re off the road, but we™re still being shelled. We sought 

cover. I jumped out of the half
-
track, because we were targets in there, no 
Œ 
no 
Œ  
no 
roof. And I 
Œ 
I jumped be 
Œ  
on the be 
Œ 
and I lay down on the back end of that. 
Some of the other fellows were in the front. I waved to them, there  in the front, 

looking back toward us, under 
Œ 
under the front axle of the vehicle. And they™re 
looking 
Œ  
and I™m waving, they™re not waving back. And again, I still hadn™t gotten 
the reality of warfare. This is very, very serious business. And then I see them 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
69
 
taking stretchers, some  of our men had been hit. It begins to have an effect, I said, 
you know, this is a 
Œ  
a  serious business. The next morning, I found
 
out how serious 
it was. We 
Œ  
we pulled into a field, there were tanks, and there are
 
half
-
tracks, a nd 
we were told to dig in. Mean, you 
Œ  
you b
uild a bu 
Œ 
you dig a bunker. I was still 
not oriented yet to military life. I was a defiant, young, 21 year old, and ah, bunker. 

You know, we™
ll be moving on, and all the 
Œ 
all the effort of going through a 
bunker. I didn™t dig a bunker. Shellfire is in the morning, early. We call it incoming 
mail. The e nemy always strikes at dawn. Incoming mail, those are the bombs are 
Œ 
these 
Œ  
these shells are  
Œ  
are 
landing. All of a sudden, my rifle is blown out of my 
hand, my hand stings. I look at my rifle lying on the ground, there™s a hole in the 
Œ 
in the ba 
Œ 
in the barrel of the rifle. So, a shell 
Œ 
a shell pierced the rifle, could have 
pierced me, but didn™t.
 
Q: Close.
 
A: Yeah, but a quick, quick lesson. Suddenly it hits me, this is very serious 
business. Every m
oment you™re out here on this 
Œ 
on this field or any other battle 
field, your life is in danger. So, quick, quick realization. From somewhere, 
somebody came up and handed 
Œ 
and ga
-
gave me a  rifle . So now I was in combat. I 
never, never disobeyed that comma
nd again, to di
-
dig when 
Œ 
when we™re 
Œ 
when 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
70
 
we™re stopped for a while, you dig yourself a foxhole, and it could save your life, 
which it did 
Œ 
did. So that was my introduction to combat.
 
Q: Was that the first time you saw casualties, where you saw people 
being killed?
 
A: It 
Œ 
it was, and it was a strange, strange feeling. After a while, we abandoned the 
half
-
tracks, so we were on foot. And I reme mber proceeding on foot. We were 
facing an enemy, we were firing, they were firing. The man in front of me, the  
man 

behind me were both hit. And wa 
Œ 
my 
Œ  
first time I had seen anybody killed in 
even civilian life. And I stopped and I paused. Troops were moving on, and I just 

paused, and I looked at these two men, and I started to think, all the wonderful 

things in life they will never see, never feel again. I 
Œ 
those thoughts just ran 
through my mind, not very formally, but tho 
Œ  
those kind of thoughts. And then I 
found myself thinking about their families, they™ll never be the same again, cause 

the father, the brother, an uncle, aunt 
Œ  
an uncle, they were gone. And so, now I was 
really introduced to warfare, and I took it very seriously from that 
Œ 
that point on.
 
Q: Sounds like it was a  wake
-
up call.
 
A: It was 
Œ 
it was my wake
-
up call.
 
Q: Yeah.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
71
 
A: I realize d this is
 
it. You 
Œ  
you protect yourself, you go after the enemy, but don™t 
forget about protecting yourself, because if you don™t, you may end up like that. 
You may end up anyway
 Œ 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: 
Œ  
like 
Œ  
like that.
 
Q: Did you know their names?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Did you know
 
who they were? Or they just happened to be in front of you?
 
A: I think 
Œ 
I think I had some casual relationship with them, because we were, you 
know, together. It™s a c asual relationship, but I don™t think I knew much about ei
-
either of them.
 
Q: Now, why 
is that you abandoned the half
-
tracks?
 
A: Why did what?
 
Q: Why did you abandon 
Œ  
why did 
Œ 
A: The half
-
track?
 
Q: Yeah, why would they abandon them?
 
A: Because they were sitting targets. They™re a v 
Œ 
a large enough vehicle, that you 
don™t have to be that accurate with shellfire. And whereas with troops 
Œ 
first of all, 
troops have 
Œ 
have a way of separating, or getting into foxholes, and all that. 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
72
 
They™re not quite tha
-
that kind of vulnera
-
vulnerability. But a half
-
track, sitting 
duck. It was a big enough ve
hicle to be a target, and 
Œ 
and they were hit 
Œ 
Q: And a tank 
Œ  
and 
a tank has enough protection?
 
A: A tank has much, much more protection. We had no protection. We had no 
Œ 
no 
top. Tanks are 
Œ 
are 
Œ  
the armor is much, much thicker than we had, and they ha
d 
protection on all sides. So, we didn™t have any of that protection. And that was just 
Œ  
those things that we rode in, those half
-
tracks, they were just vehicles to move us 
faster. Othe rwise, troops had to be moved by trucks, to get them up to s
-
speed, an
d 
part of 
Œ 
part of it was marching. But a good part of the time to get 
Œ  
get them up on 
bat 
Œ  
in 
Œ  
in the battlefield, was by truck. So, we had a lot of those trucks going. But 
yeah, we were too vulnerable, so we were the 
Œ 

Q: Do you know where in 
F rance
 
you were at this point?
 
A: No, I had no idea.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: No idea. Didn™t 
Œ 
I do remember that one of the battles that we fought, and I did 
see it on a map later on, was the Battle of hans 
Œ 
hi 
Œ  
Han
-
sur
-N
ied
, h
-a-n -s-u-r-n -
i-e-
d. It was the first real, big battle that we, the unit that I was with, faced. We had 
to cross the 
Hans
-
sur
-
Nieds
 
river. The Germans 
Œ 
we had driven the Germans over 
that river
. 

 
Interview with Robert Max

Q: It sounds like a German, or a Belgian ka 
Œ 
or a Flemish kind of name, ra ther than 
a French one.
 
A: Yeah
. Well, do 
Œ  
I don™t even reca 
Œ 
we 
Œ  
we were in 
France
 
yet, but I don™t 
reme mber any more of it than that 
Œ  

Q: Okay.
 
A: 
Œ  
just what it was c alled 
[indecipherable]
 
and the river was named 
Œ 
what then 
Œ  
was named after the river. The Germans had just retreated over that river, and 
they were sitting up on a hill above, and zeroed in right on the spot. A 
Œ 
very, very 
easy to zero in on any troops, or any vehicles certainly, c oming across. So we 
crossed 
Œ  
and I remember scuttlebutt among the troops was that we™
re going into a 
very dangerous battle. How we knew, or how they knew, I do 
Œ  
I don™t know, but a 
very dangerous battle. We have to cross a river up there, and we think the odds of 

getting across are not very great. So here™s my introduction really, to comb
at 
conditions. So we 
Œ  
we did go on 
Œ  
on foot. We crossed the river.
 
Q: Over a bridge?
 
A: There was a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
it was a 
Œ 
a structured bridge, structured by probably the 
German troops, I don™t 
Œ 
yeah, they had to be by the German troops, but as 
structured for
 
hev 
Œ  
strong enough to carry vehicles across. So we crossed that 
bridge, facing enemy fire as we 
Œ 
as we did. And they retreated, we dro 
Œ  
drove 

 
Interview with Robert Max

them back, and the battle was 
Œ 
was an accomplishment, and it was a je 
Œ 
the 
general 
Œ  
a famo
u
s general, Third
A
rmy. 
Patton
. One 
Œ 
a great, great 
Œ  
a great 
Œ 
a 
victory for General 
George Patton
, and the Sixth Armored Infantry Division, 
which was our operation. We were operating within the thir 
Œ 
his 
Third A
rmy.
 
But 
it was a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a victory. And then, obviously, we
 
moved on from there.
 
Q: What was the weather like at that point?
 
A: I don™t remember it very well. I don™t think it was yet what we 
Œ 
it was probab 
Œ  
we were probably in November weather, October, November, as we fought. So it 
wasn™t real cold yet. That was about to come, as we moved into December, and 

headed toward my next major battle. And that turned out to be the Battle of the 
Bulge.
 
Q: Okay, before we get there, as y ou™re crossing the river, and the German army is 
retreating, were you involved in combat, or was it there  was 
Œ 
there were m 
Œ  
soldiers and infantry in front of you who were engaging with them, and you were 
following behind?
 
A: No, I don™t rememb er where I was positioned, but we were firing.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: And we were firing on the enemy, and they were retreating. We moved through 

with a 
Œ 
with a heavier force, apparently, and because the bridge was built strong

enough, our tanks were able to get through, too. So, the Germans were being 
subjected to heavy fire.
 

Q: Okay.
 
A: I™m trying to piece this together as best a s I can reme mber 
Œ 

Q: It™s okay.
 
A: 
Œ  
and a lot of it is very vague.
 
Q: I can imagine. I can imagine, yeah.
 
A: But 
Œ  
but I™m 
Œ  
I™m thi 
Œ  
thinking two things. One, that I re member precisely, 
the other I™m estimating what we must have b
een doing at 
Œ  
at the time, how we 
must have been fi
-
fighting then. They were retreating, so we must have been firing 
Œ 
Q: Okay.
 
A: 
Œ  
a lot of heavy stuff at them 
Œ 
at them. So, that went on, and 
Œ  
and 
Œ  
and battles 
continued until December 16, 1944.
 
Q: An
d what happened then? What happened?
 
A: That was 
Œ 
that was the 
Œ 
the 
Œ  
the 
Œ  
the Germans have been driven back that far. 
This was their last ma jor, major thrust. And that was to turn their 
Œ 
that was in their 
view, to turn the tide of battle against the allie d forces. And our forces were arrayed 

 
Interview with Robert Max

north and south along 
Œ  
alo 
Œ  
a long, long, long corridor, so to speak.
 
And that was 
their major thrust.
 
Q: But you didn™t know it at the time, did you?
 
A: Didna 
Œ 
didn™t 
Œ  
had no idea what it was, and what it was going to be called. All 
we knew, that we were facing heavy, heavy artillery.
 
Q: And you were 
Œ 
were you in 
Belgium
, or were you still in 
France
? Where wer 
Œ 
where do you think you were?
 
A: I 
Œ  
I was in 
Œ 
in 
Belgium
, very southern tip of 
Belgium
, near 
Basto
g
ne
, in 
Œ  
near 
Œ  
right outside of 
Marvie
, 
m-a -r-v -i-e
, 
Marvie
,
 
Belgium
, southeastern corner, 
just above 
Germany
, just north of 
Germany
. And so, heavy, heavy shellfire poured 
in on us. We were bogged down. The unit that I had 
Œ 
the 
Œ  
the company 
Œ 
Q: Were you in a field, in a forest, in a town?
 
A: Lots of forests. It was 
Œ 
it was called 
Œ 
th
-
the battle itself, I had fought through 
two other major battles across 
France
, this was my third battle. It was called
 
the 
Ardennes
 
campaign, because it was being fought
 
in the 
Ardennes
 
forest, he avily 
treed. And that was southeastern 
Belgium
, and northwe 
Œ  
northeastern 
Germany
. 
Q: Northwestern, excuse me for correcting,
 
but just for the future, north
western 
Germany
. Cause the east would be near 
Poland
.

A: Oh yeah, yeah, 
oh of 
Œ 
oh, of 
Œ 
oh, of course. Of course northwestern 
Germany
, 
of course.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: The surprise 
Œ 
and what 
Œ  
the 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I was 
Œ  
I learned to believe, let™s 
say, from what I read later on, that the Americans expected a major thrust, because 

t
he Germans could be driven just back 
Œ  
back just so far. And they had tremendous, 
heavy artillery. Their tank corps were probably superior to the American. And so I 
th 
Œ  
I believe that our top command expected that, but nevertheless, the 
Œ 
the 
magnitude of
 
the attack was just overpowering. The company that I had trained 
with, the 106
th
 
infantry division, in the 
U
.
S
., on that
 
first day of battle, lost 75 
percent of its troops, killed, wounded or captured, or missing. Seventy
-
five percent 
in one day. The word
 
was that that division that I trained with 
Œ  
and I left early, to 
be shipped over as a replacement, they were not ready yet for combat. They were 
green. And you read the accounts of 
Œ 
of 
Œ  
of that unit, the 106
th
 
infantry division, 
and you realize how poo
rly prepared they were. They were scattered, they ran in all 
directions. Some of them shot their own men. They were just firing at anything they 

saw. They were such in 
Œ 
in that kind of disarray. And I hate to think about that 
with an American unit, particularly one that I trained with. But nevertheless, the 

Germans were well
-
equipped, well trained, well prepared, and they 
Œ  
they 
Œ  
and 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
78
 
then they 
Œ 
they drove in
-
into us. The report that I read later on, when I was 
reported missing in action, was that the unit I was with had been subjected to heavy 
enemy fire. And in the process, troops were scattered, and got lost. And thus, I was 
reported missing in action, because I was 
Œ  
I was not present, not account 
Œ 
accounted 
Œ  
I couldn™t be accounted for.
 
Q: So, what 
happened to you?
 
A: 
Ah, that™s 
Œ 
see, they didn™t 
Œ 
they didn™t have that 
Œ 
they didn™t have that. All 
they knew was that I was 
Œ 
I was missing. When you tally up your troops afterward, 
you say, this guy™s missing. They had no idea what happened to me. We 
had been 
fighting, the German attacked, and I was with the unit, I was on the line, I was 
fighting. We were face  to face with the enemy, we were fi
-
fighting. And then I and 
others were 
Œ 
were ordered back behind the lines, because this had been going on 
fo
r days, and I was weary. So yeah, they figured the troops need some rest, go back 
behind the lines
, get some rest, get some food, and then you™ll resume later on. So 
when I got behind 
Œ  
behind the lines, I was now with all allied forces, the ger 
Œ 
Germans 
were far removed, I heard somebody say, we need volunteers. We™ve lost 
radio contact. The Germans have apparently knocked out our radio contact with 

front line troops. So we have to establish where our 
Œ 
our lines are. We need vala 
Œ 
volunteers to do that.
 
I was still 21, I think, so I was young, and adventurous. I™d 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
79
 
just begun to learn what war was about. But I also felt tha t it was a mission. 
Something moved me, and 
Œ  
and I said, yeah. So I™ll vol 
Œ 
I™ll volunteer. I saw a 
Jeep
 
in the
 
di 
Œ  
in the distance, and I said, I™ll get that 
Jeep
. And I signaled to five 
others, and they joined me. We sa id, we 
Œ 
we 
Œ  
we™ll be a volunteer task force, 
we™ll go as far as we c an go, and see if we ca n identify where our lines are. High 

command cannot pri 
Œ 
plan strategy, unless they know where the lines are. So, 
that™s what we started out to do. So, we™re in this
 
Jeep
, it™s now 
Œ  
the vision is not 
very clear, it™s an overcast sky. I remember driving the 
Jeep
, the roads are covered 

with i 
Œ  
snow and ice. We round a curve, and just about 
Œ 
maybe about 10 to 15 
yards ahead of me, there™s a German 88 millimete r cannon pointed right at the 
Jeep
, 
right at us. And it™s mounted on an 80 
Œ 
on a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a German ta
-
tank. And so, you 
know, anybody pulled that trigger, we were gone. And I can talk, and I do talk man 

Œ  
many, many times, the number of time s that you are exposed to killing, to being 
killed, and that was 
Œ 
that was one of them, a nd there were many, many others. So 
it™s, you know, miracle s take place , and you don™t get killed.
 
But that was one that 
they certainly 
Œ 
somebody should have pulled the trigger, and we would have been 
gone. They didn™t. I ja mmed on the brakes, we skidded off the road. All of a 
sudden, fire from rifle s 
Œ 
apparently mi 
Œ 
rifle s and machine
-
guns
, small a
rm
 
fire, is 
pouring in from our right. And we 
Œ  
none of us were hit immediately. I 
Œ  
I say, we 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
80
 
have to 
Œ  
we have to defend ourselves yet. Have to find something, we can™t do it 
from the 
Jeep
 
here. We see a shack across the road, and I say, we move toward t
hat 
shack. We did. One of the men had the perception to real
-
realiz e,
 
we go near the 
machine
-
gun 
Œ s
ome 
Œ  
somebody™s firing a lot of 
Œ 
lot of ri
-
rifle fire  at us, or 
machine
-
gun fire. So he too 
Œ 
he detached the one from the 
Jeep
, and brought that 
with us.
 
So we start rac ing for the shack. One of our men is hit and killed on the 
way over. We get to the shack, and the enemy fire is still pouring in. We have to set 
up the mac hine
-
gun, some way, to fire back. And so there™s a big bay window in the 
shack. The m
an who took the mac hine
-
gun, I think it was him, he sets it up in the 
window, and he starts firing. Within maybe a minute or so, he™s hit, and he™s 
Œ 
he™s 
killed. When I talk to student groups, I 
Œ 
I say sometimes people 
Œ 
un
-
understand, 
you do things unde
r battlefield conditions, you do things you would not normally 
do, because you do it on your instinct. Something tells you that you have to take 
Œ 
you have to do something right now. So, my instinct, without thinking about the 
consequences, I was wide open, I would be killed just like the other man was, your 
instinct is a  
Œ 
is a 
Œ  
jump behind that gun. Which is what I did, and I started firing
. 
And I fired the machine gun at everything I saw move. I hit some, probably killed a 
number of their men. And that 
went on 
Œ  
that had starte d early in the morning 
Œ  
that 
went on until late in the afternoon, we™re running out of fire. We didn™t 
Œ  
we had no 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
81
 
idea what we were against, at the  time. I lea rned later on that there were at least a 
hundred 
Œ  
somewhere between a
 
hundred and 200 si 
Œ 
over there, dug in, in 
foxholes. And we were 
Œ 
we starte d out with six of us, one was killed immediately, 
so there were five of us, fighting them, and for a good part of the day. That 

machine
-
gun really kept us going.
 
When we ran lowon ammunition, we had to 
devise some strategy, how do we get out of this? We had two wounded. There was 

another window, so two a 
Œ 
two of them were hit. I 
Œ 
I looked, and I saw a tra p door 
in the floor of this shack, meaning there must be a cellar beneath.
 
So the strategy 
was simply this; we had to make them believe that they killed us off, or that we 
Œ 

we 
Œ  
we took off toward our 
Œ 
our rank, toward our 
Œ 
our la 
Œ 
our American and our 
British lines. And so, I figure, we™ll climb down into this cellar, and then when it™s 

dark, under cover of darkness, we™ll emerge. If we can take those two wounded, we 

will certainly do that, we certainly wanted to do that. And we 
Œ 
so that was the 
Œ 
that was the idea. We would infiltrate through their lines at night, under co
ver of 
darkness, we possibly could do that.
 
Q: So there were two of you who were not wounded yet?
 
A: Ah, well there were 
Œ 
we started out with six, five me 
Œ  
six, one was hit. So there 
were five of us. So there 
Œ 
there were two wounded, and three able
-
bodi
ed. So we 
Œ 
that wa 
Œ 
that was the strategy, then we would come out and make our way back 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
82
 
through the lines. Beca use we had no ammunition, we absolutely ran out of a
-
ammunition. Of about 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I don™t know, it was about a half hour or so 
Œ 
no way to 
measur
e time, but I figured somewhere around there, I push open that trap door, 
maybe we could come out now, maybe it™s dark now, and what I saw 
Œ 
and I always 
tell people when I 
Œ 
when I talk to them, there™s some things in battle, in combat, or 
captivity, that
 
you don™t remembe r, that you block out, and some of them are 
blocked out of your mind. Either you don™t ca 
Œ 
you don™t reme mber them, or you 
don™t want to remember them. Some that you have a vague re 
Œ 
recollection of, and 
others that remain visible to you, perhaps for the rest of your life, as this one does 
today. So as I stand before you now, I can tell you, I see that rim of black, automatic 
guns, all pointed down, right at my face. And behind each of those guns is a white
-
cloaked, camouflaged German soldier, holding that gun, trigger finger poised, ready 
to fire at any moment. 
[doorbell]
 

Q: Let™s cut
. 
[break]
 
All right, so 
Œ 
so be
-
before the interruption, we™re at a 
moment that is defining. You open up this trap door, and you see these gun barrels 

point
ed at you, and behind them are these white, ca mouflaged soldiers.
 
A: Right.
 
Q: The enemy. What happened?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
83
 
A: The 
Œ 
the view is still 
Œ  
still vivid, right here til 
Œ 
to 
Œ  
to this day, what are we, 
70 years later, I can still see them there, stark as can be, in addition to all those 
Œ 
those guns, pointed right at me, the stark nature of the black against the white. And 
they motioned, come up. And so we come up, and we take the wounded up with us. 
What 
Œ  
for whatever reason, they 
Œ 
this German sergeant takes me
 
a side, the others 
take the other America ns, and they™re off. I never see them again, and the German 

sergeant is in charge of me now. And he™s got a rifle ba rrel in my back, pushing me 
around. Usher him around the shack, to make sure there are no booby traps there, 
and then he pushes me, rifle in the back, across the road. This road, as I write a bout 

it, I ca ll the  moat. It was like a moat, it was 
Œ  
separated us, one from the other, and 
w -w -
we were in our castle, that little shack, a nd the moat protecting u s from the 
enemy. But we crossed the road, and just then 
Œ 
we get onto the other side, and just 
then, art 
Œ 
heavy artillery comes in. I never knew, and don™t know to 
Œ 
to 
Œ  
today, 
whether it was British or American, but it™s coming in. We had called for it
 
ea rly in 
the day, and now it just starts coming in. It™s dusk, it™s 
Œ 
nightfall is coming on, and 
these shells are landing. The German sergeant jumps into his bunker, his foxhole, 

and I motioned to come down. 
Nein
,
 
nein
, he said, 
nein
,
 
nein
,
 
nein
,
 
nein
,
n
ein
,
 
nein
. No, he would not let me come down. I need some shelter. I™m now being 
exposed 
Œ  
remember, it™s the 
Ardennes
 
forest, tree s all a round, and that™s one of 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
84
 
the worst things you can have, because you get shell blasts when those things hit, 
and that 
Œ  
that pieces of hot metal come pouring down at you. All you need is a 
pie
ce in the wrong place, and your 
Œ 
Q: You™re gone.
 
A: 
Œ  
you™re dead.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: And that™s the nature of things. I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I keep thinking of it so often 
Œ 
people 
remind me sometime s in
 
talking, you had so many opportunities to die. That was 
another
 
one
. I mean, the fact that you weren™t hit, with all these shells coming in, 
was amazing. Anyway, so the German is in his bunker, and the shellfire is coming 
in. I say to him, what are you going to do with me? I figure he doesn™t 
Œ 
he speaks 
German. And he looks up at me, a nd he says, I have to kill you. In English. So here 
it is, the good fortune, you get a German who s 
Œ 
soldier who speaks English. So 
now, you can converse. I have to kill you. The assumption is that he will. He™s 
going to turn his rifle on me, and he will shoot.
 
Q: And that™s what he would have done, had he not been interrupted.
 

A: Chances are yes, because the order had been issued, high command. This is late 
in the war now, and they™re not to take any more allied prisoners alive. They just 
can™t cope with them. They have to deal with the enemy. So they just shoot them. 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
85
 
We™re not going to house them, a nd feed them. So, not to be taken alive. My 
assumption was, he was going topull his gun, and fire.
 

Q: I want to interrupt at one point, before we go on. Do you have any kind of 
thinking on why you were separated out? The four were taken by other guys, and 
why you were separated out?
 
A: I think was pure chance.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: Just the way we were set up, the others were sort of together, and somebody just 

moved them away, and I was left with him. I think just chance.
 
Q: And do you think they were then shot?
 
A: I have no idea. I just don™t know what happened to them.
 
They might have be
en, 
because again, the order had been issued. They weren™t 
Œ  
they 
just weren™t taking 
any prisoners alive any more. They couldn™t 
Œ 
couldn™t afford to do that. So, that 
was it, and when he said, I 
Œ 
I have to kill you, I assume d he would turn his rifle on 
me, and I looked down the road. Now, it™s 
Œ 
it™s night, it™s dark. There™s a burning 
tank in a field nearby. And the ro 
Œ  
and that road we crossed over is lit up. Also at 
the side of the road, at their side, I see these bunkers, one after another. And I se
e 
two silhouettes on each bunker, one is a German helmet, and the other is a mac hine
-
gun. So I know, that as far a s I co uld see, the 
Œ 
there were bunkers. I had been a 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
86
 
sprinter in school, and I just, very, very briefly thought, my gosh, all that running 
ex
perience, if ever there was a time to use it, this is it. And I was gonna sprint dow 
Œ  
try to get out into the road and sprint down that road. Then I suddenly realized, 
you™d be shot out of the starting block. They had 
all these guns trained on you. I 

mean
, t
here  was no way you could es 
Œ 
you could escape. Behind me, if I tried to 
run there, there were guards there. There were other foxholes, so I 
Œ 
it was just no 
place to go. And so I 
Œ 
I se 
Œ 
I realized I had 
Œ 
the only option I had was 
conversation. But I™m talking to a German. And so, what he 
Œ 
and then I 
reme mbered, just a moment ago he said, I have to shoot you, this man speaks 

English. Maybe we can converse, and you know. So he says 
Œ 
he looks up at me 
Œ 
we pau 
Œ  
we paused for a while. I™ve given up t
he idea of running. He looks up and 
he says, why are you Americans here? This is not your war.
 
I sa id, 
how 
Œ  
I said, 
you 
made it our war, how can you say that? Conversation goes on. The reason that I 

think this sequence would be so good on film, as opposed
 
to just in print, you know, 
you have to see a relationship developing between this German soldier, and this 

American soldier. I™m his captive, he™s supposed to shoot me, and he doesn™t.
 
Q: What did he look like? Do you reme mber what he looked like?
 
A: The
 
one thing I don™t remembe r, because I kept seeing that helmet on the 
Œ 
he 
didn™t look up all the time, like tha t. Sometimes he was looking straight ahead, and 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
87
 
we were talking. And I 
Œ  
I comme nt on that in my book, that while lying in the 
hospital and thinking of some of these events that occurred, I try to reme mber his 
face, and I can™t, because again, I saw so little of it. Maybe his chin under that 
helmet, but not the whole face.
 
And the conversation goes on. He reaches down into 
his pocket, and I figure
 
he™s got a pistol there. He™s a noncommissioned officer, 
he™s probably allowed to carry a pistol, he™s going to shoot me with a pistol instead 
of the rifle. Instead, he pulls out a wallet. He opens the wallet, and then he turns it 
towards me, he shows me pictures of his wife and two children. And he says, next 
year, we will be in 
New York City
. That was his plan. He foresaw
 
it. H e was a 
good Nazi, he believed that they were going to win the war, and he would 
Œ  
they™d 
go on vacation, and they™d take, of all
 
places in the world, 
New York City
. To 
them, it™s like 
Paris 
is to us. And so, the conversation wears on, and we™re talking. 
And I 
Œ 
I ke 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I feel a change in attitude. This guy is not the 
Œ  
he™s not the 
enemy an
-
any more. And I don™t think he sees me
 
a s the enemy either. And we™re 
talking. His English is more than good enough. I mean, I understand everything he 

is saying. And so, we converse. After a while 
Œ 
and as I say, attitu de is changing, 
we™re 
Œ  
we™re not antagonists. The way we were 
Œ 
Q: Are the shells still falling?
 
A: By this time, I think they had ceased. Yes, they had.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
88
 
Q: So, he™s in the foxhole, and you™re on the ground above it.
 
A: I™m standing above him, looking down.
 
Q: So you™re standing?
 
A: I™m standing. Oh yeah, I™ve 
Œ 
I was completely vulnerable while the shells were 
Œ  
were landing. Oh, I 
Œ 
I was stan ding all the time. I didn™t get an invitation to sit at 
the edge of the foxhole and dangle my feet into it, nut 
Œ 
nut 
Œ  
you know, there was 
no 
Œ  
no invitation. I just 
Œ 
I stood all the time . But again, there™s something 
changing in our relationship. And finally, he looks 
Œ 
he looks up at me, he says, for 
you, the war is over. And I assume he™s going to turn his rifle on me, kill me. His 

next statement is, I™m going to send you to a prisone
r of war camp. He knew, and 
he 
knew that I knew, in the 
POW
 
camp, you don™t have to fight any more, you get 
shelter, food, good treatment. T hey did 
Œ  
I™m quite certain 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ 
I know 
this, that they 
Œ 
they did follow the 
Geneva
 
con 
Œ  
the rules of the 
Geneva 
convention, and if I did go back to a prisoner of war camp, that I would not have to 
fight any more. And that was his way of ex 
Œ 
of recognizing gallantry. And he said 
Œ  
he went on to say 
Œ  
he says, we had many more men than you, but you fo
ught 
well. And as I said, how 
Œ 
I didn™t think right at the moment, but later on when I 
Œ 
when I thought back about that, what gallantry. You know, here™s a German soldier, 
my archenemy, and he™s going to save my life, because he understood and 

 
Interview with Robert Max

appreciated
 
the way we fought against these extreme odds. And he said, you killed 
many of our men, but you fought well. And so he 
Œ  
he, in earnest, was about to save 
my life. He  orders over two guards to take me away. As they do, there™s 
Œ 
we™re 
stopped along the way
, and I can look 
Œ  
I can see by the things on the man™s 
shoulder, or wherever they were, that he™s an officer. And there™s a German 
conversation that goes on. I don™t know what the conversation is, but I soon 

recognize what it was. No, I™m not going to a prisoner of war camp, they don™t take 
prisoners any more, I™m going to become a slave laborer. Because one of the things 
that they needed 
Œ  
and there were ma
-
many, a
-
as you well know, non
-
military men 
who are forced into slave labor. And slave labor in many
 
of the camps, existe d. 
Anyway, that™s what I™m going to be.
 

Q: And how do you understand this?
 

A: What followed. I didn™t understand what they were sa ying, but when I realized 

afterward, that no longer did I have those guards, somebody else took me, and 
p
ushed me 
Œ 
al
-
always I 
Œ  
did I 
Œ 
rifle barrel was in the back
, kept pushing me with 
the rifle barrel, until suddenly, I™m confronted with a bunch of soldiers; I don™t 
recognize the uniforms. As one of my friends, who™s a historian told me, he a 
Œ  
he a 
Œ  
to
ld me those were quite likely Russian troops, that had 
Œ 
then he describes how 
Russian troops would be in that area. And chances are they were, because they were 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015

completely foreign uniforms. They were not German, they were not British, they 
were not American. And so I see all these uniforms, and others from different 
Œ  
obviously some other countries involved in there. And I™m pushed by rifle butt, and 
I 
Œ  
I fall to the ground. I see a ll these people around. I don™t know what it™s all 
about, I have no idea y
et. So we 
Œ  
we sit there, we™re sitting on snow, and finally, a 
rifle butt to the back again, up, and then the rife 
Œ 
he sort of motions up, up, and 
we™re into a forced march. Before they did that, though, they stripped me of my 

winter coat, and the gloves. This is 
Germany
™
s
 
coldest winter on record. The 
temperature during that period, I was told later, was between zero and five degrees 
Fahrenheit
. The coldest on record. So now I™m going to go without any gloves, no 
winter garments, just a thin jacket. That™s it as I go ahead, forced marched with 
these others.
 

Q: Did they ever find identity papers on you? Did you have identity papers, did you 

have 
Œ 
A: All I had on me was my dog
-
tags that had a 
J
. Some had a 
J
, some had an 
H
. I 
had a 
J
. I had two other things on me. One was a 
Mogen David
, a Star of 
David
, a 
Jewish symbol, and the other was a miniature 
mezuzah
, what we Jews put on our 
door
posts. I wore them with my dog
-
tags. I was 21, and I was defiant. There was no 
way in the world that I was going to remove those. I was told, though I didn™t see it, 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
91
 
but I was told that some destroyed their dog
-
tags, because they didn™t want to be 
identified as Jews. But, I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I stuck stea dfast to that, and I wore them. I didn™t 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ 
I didn™t know what I 
Œ  
what
 
I was getting into at this point, and nobody 
was talking in English, so I had no idea where 
Œ 
where we were going, what we 
were going to do.
 
Q: Did they know you were Jewish?
 
A: Not at that time, be ca 
Œ 
reme mber this, they have 
Œ 
each 
Œ  
each of these sold
iers 
has a responsibility. Theirs was not ideology, theirs was not to eradicate all the Jews 
in the world. Theirs was to get work done. That work was rebuilding their railroads, 

bombed by allied planes. That was the only mission they had. So 
Œ  
but I didn™t
Œ  
I 
did not know that. I did not know what we were going to be doing, what I wa 
Œ 
I 
didn™t know what I was. I just knew that I was 
Œ 
I was thrust into something with a 
bunch of other men. I was namele ss, numberless. I was just a body, working hands, 

and t
hat™s what I would be. And only later did I learn that I was the re for slave 
labor, and whether I lived or died, made no difference to them whatsoever.
 

Q: How did you learn that you were there for slave labor? What told you that?
 
A: Well, later on, when I saw what we were doing.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: Now, it™s ti 
Œ 
I don™t know this yet.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
92
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: And we™re being force marched. Darkness descends. When they took off my 
gloves and coat, I assumed that they were going to 
Œ 
I was a prisoner, I was their 
prisoner, I was
 
going to go to a barracks someplace, and I™d have shelter. That 
wasn™t on 
Œ 
on their minds, at all. So when darkness fell, they motioned, down, 
down, and pushed some of us down on the ground. On the ground. We™re on a road. 

Off to the side they push us, a
nd say 
Œ 
I don™t reme mber what they said, but it was 
obvious we were going to lie there , and that™s where we were going to sleep. The 

roads were covered, most of the time, with snow, or ice. Sometimes they™re just 

dark, dirty 
Œ  
you know, dirt, you know, bu
t most of the time was snow or ice. And 
they had guards patrolling. That™s where you spent the night. For the next 80 some 

odd, out of 90 nights, that™s where I slept, without a coat, with no gloves, hands 
Œ 

hands tucked in here, to try to keep warm. Toes 
moving constantly. Toes and 

fingers cons 
Œ  
constant movement. Otherwise, they would have frozen. Which they 
did later anyway, I had frostbite. But this is one of the remarkable things that 

happened during that period. Desperate, you™re freezing, almost fre
e zing to death, 

really, because much more of that, and I would have. The only thing that could 
sustain me, was menta l or emotional. And what I thought of was food. And one 
thing you never really want to think about when you™re starving 
Œ  
I think everybody 

 
Interview with Robert Max

93
 
would s 
Œ 
would s 
Œ 
would re 
Œ 
reme mber that, you don™t think about food. But that 
helped to sustain me. It™s not only physical pain, but emotional
 
pain that I was 
going through. And so, if I could draw some kind of an emotion, that would give 
me some hope
 
for the future, maybe that would help to see me through whatever 
this is that I™m 
Œ 
I™m getting in
-
into.
 
Q: What did they feed you?
 
A: What did they feed 
Œ 
feed me?
 
Q: Mm
-
hm.
 
A: Crusts of dark brown bread. T hat was the standard. And that 
Œ 
most days 
Œ 
I™m
 
not sure if we got that every day, but that was 
Œ 
that was the food. There were two 
camps we passed through. Labor camps, not prisoner of war camps, but labor 
camps. E
-
Even that would have been better than what we had. Cause I had the 
maximum of exposure 
you could. But in the 
Œ 
in these camps, we 
Œ 
which we just 
passed through, only spent the day going through them, I reme mber in jeros 
Œ 
in 
Prum
,
p -r-u -m
, 
Germany
, a labor camp, we were given six, one inch in diameter 
crackers, sort of dry cracker, and that
 
was it for the day. We went on marching. We 
got to 
Gerolstein
 
in 
Germany
, and there they gave us a can 
Œ 
and I don™t mean a 
canteen, the way the milita ry has, but a ti 
Œ 
old 
Œ  
like an old, tin 
Campbell
™
s 
soup 
can. And old tin can, and in it was some hot water. There was a little piece of potato 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
94
 
at the bottom, that was the flavoring. So that was called soup. And we drank that 
hot water, that was it for the day. I don™t have to make a ny more clear than that how 

our 
Œ  
how our nutritional needs were not being met, and malnutrition set in rapidly, 
and you could feel it happening. But that essentially is 
Œ 
is the 
Œ 
is the amount of 
food that we had.
 
Q: How does one feel malnutrition? 
[technical interruption]
 
How does one feel 
malnutrition set in? What happens?
 
A:
 
You know 
Œ 
Q: What happened to you?
 
A: Consciously, you know, of course, that you™re not being fed adequately. And just 
from logical standpoint, you begin to say that, you know, you 
Œ  
you 
Œ  
this can™t go 
on too long
. S o intellectually, you realize  that so
mething is going to be happening to 
your body. Then you start to feel weakness. The marches are more difficult, they™re 
getting more and more difficult. You feel pain in your stomach, cause there™s 
nothing to fill it, and that radiates through your body. S
o y
-y -
you 
Œ  
you know that 
there™re physical aspects taking shape now, and you know 
Œ  
I mea n, I 
Œ 
I knew that 
bodies do deteriorate if you don™t get 
Œ 
you know, I was brought up as a child, e at 
your cereals, eat your vegetables, and so forth. You have to, t
o build your bodies. 
So I knew I wasn™t getting any of that, so my body had to deteriorate. After a while 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
95
 
Œ  
that 
Œ  
that takes a lot of days, and maybe weeks before you really see it. And I 
could feel my shoulders, they were very boney, and my arms were starting to lose 
some of the flesh that they had. And so I began to realize that, yeah, there was some 
kind of deterioration going on here. But weakness probably was the greatest 
recognition that I had, that something was happening to the body. Then, as we we
re 
being force marched, sometimes from location to location, when we worked on 

railroads, people were dropping out along the way. And I realized that they were 
dropping out from weakness, from the malnutrition. Must be 
Œ 
must be a 
Œ 
a 
chemical 
[indecipherable]
 
condition, whatever it was. But they were 
Œ 
Q: They were starving.
 

A: 
Œ  
they were dropping along the way. Dropping out was not a good thing, because 
you were no longer useful as a slave laborer, and
 
so either 
Œ 
in some cases 
Œ 
wh
y 
they made the decision, I don™t know, but in some cases, they left the man there  to 
die. In other cases, they shot the man. Yeah.
 
Q: Did you see these things?
 
A: Pardon?
 
Q: Did you see those things?
 
A: I saw them. One of the 
Œ 
be
-
before I leave the subject altogether, I just want to 
go back to that period of sleeping at night, and the food. And I thought about food. 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
96
 
It sustained me emotionally, to be able to go on. Why? Because I figure someday 
I™m going to get out of this, I d 
Œ 
I don™t know how, but someday I will 
Œ  
I will 
Œ  
this will be over, and tho 
Œ  
and the wonderful foods 
Œ 
when you™re starving, you 
think about food. And I said, I ca 
Œ  
those wonderful foods, the things that my 
mother used to make, things we got in the pizza parlor. You know, all 
Œ 
all the 
wonderful thing, someday I™m going to have that again. And that emotionally 

helped to carry 
Œ 
carry me. So rather than 
Œ  
rather than drop out and die on th 
Œ 
on 
Œ  
on li 
Œ 
lying there, I was able to sustain myself with the belief that someday I would 
have access to those foods. Months later, when I was hospitalized, I asked a nurse to 

bring me a little book 
Œ  
booklet of some sort that I could write on, I recorded that. I 
have that here.
 
Q: Oh wow.
 

A: It™s 
Œ 
I c all it my little brown book. I recorded 84 foods. They™re in that book, if 
you want to see la ter, it™s r 
Œ 
it™s right in an envelope over there.
 
Q: We™ll 
Œ  
we™ll take a  look and we™ll film it. That™ll be great.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Yeah.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
97
 
A: I have that book, along with the dog
-
tags with the Jewish emblems on them. I ha 
Œ  
have 
those here. So, might be nice to do that. But those 
Œ 
so I reme mbered the 
84 
foods, and that did, emotionally, it helped to sustain me.
 
Q: I also 
Œ 
I™m sorry that I™m inte rrupting, but I also have another question. You had 
said that your basic training in 
Alabama
, in a hundred degree
-
plus heat 
Œ 
A: Right.
 
Q: 
Œ  
prepared you. Yet, when you were under the strain and you were in 
Œ 
captured, 
you were 
at 
minus something Fahrenheit temperature. What about the basic 
training, then, was transferable from one climate
 
to the other?
 
A: It wasn™t the clima te, but it was the bo 
Œ  
the strengthening of body.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: They built our bodies, as I told 
Œ 
the exercise drills, were ve 
Œ 
were reasonably 
extreme. And so, I was probably in the best condition of my life, physi
-
ph
ysically. 
So that™s all. But wha
-
wha 
Œ  
what™s 
Œ  
what™s odd about that
 
is that I went from the 
extremes in temperature in basic training, from a hundred 
Œ 

Q: Right.
 

A: 
Œ  
down to zero, you know.
 
Q: That™s right.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
98
 
A: And that was 
Œ  
that was a gr 
Œ 
a great, great vari
-
variation.
 
So these forced 
marches went on. We stopped along the way, to work on the railroads, but to work 
on the railroads, we had to move railroad tracks, long, heavy railroad tracks, one 
area to another. If their sup 
Œ 
to keep their supply line
 
going to their troops, they 
had to maintain the railroads. And so, we had to get tracks, sometimes from one 
abandoned railroad, to another that was in service, and needed. Mostly at night, we 

were forced marched again, we had to carry those railroad track
s on our shoulders. 
Now, this is when I knew they 
Œ  
they became boney, because ri 
Œ  
they hurt. We 
would carry them sometime, from one town to another, many miles. And I would 

have one on my shoulder, and somebody in front would have ano 
Œ 
have the other 
en
d of it on his shoulder. So we had to carry those railroad tracks, town to town.
 
Q: Did you ever speak with any of the other prisoners?
 
A: Speech was not allowed, conversation was not allowed. If you 
Œ 
if they caught 
you talking, they turned their gun on you. I don™t remember seeing anybody shot, 
because we maintained the code of silence pretty well, I don™t remember seeing. 
But I have no doubt that if they 
Œ 
we were caught, we would have. What we did do 
though, is to 
Œ 
when we could, when we saw there were
 
no guards right around, 
who could see it, we would exchange the sabotage work that we did on the 

railroads. This was, again, youth, my youth, that 
I 
was yo 
Œ  
figures
 
they™re not 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
99
 
going to do this to me, I™m not going to build anything that they can use. An
d the 
others had similar attitudes. So, when we were required to build the railroads, these 
Œ  
these tracks, put them together, we didn™t always line them up well. We didn™t put 
the pins in where they should. And that was with 
Œ 
with some pride, that we did
 
that. So, when we had the opportunity to exchange something, he 
Œ 
thi
-
this guy 
would tell me what he did, and I would tell him, with delight, that I didn™t put those 

pins in there. And we 
Œ 
we felt we were 
Œ 
we were giving it back to the Germans. 
So that 
Œ  
that continued, more and more star 
Œ 
started to decline in health. I have 
Œ 
can I show
 
that
 
shoe? It figured so 
Œ 
Q: Can 
Œ  
can we cut for just a se cond? 
[break]
 
Okay, okay, so we™re rolling. So tell 
me, what about 
Œ 
what is this shoe? 
 
A: Symbolic of the
 
torture 
Œ  
the 
torturous mind, that I
 
also had 
Œ 
had to live with 
Œ 
physical torture, yes, but the mental, sometimes was even worse. I c ontracted 

frostbite, particularly in my right foot.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: And as we marched on and on, it became  more and more pai
nful. My foot was 
now exceeding the size of the shoe. And I wanted to scre 
Œ 
yell out, the pain was 
that great. I didn™t dare, cause had I done that, I probably would have either been 

pushed aside and left to die, or prob 
Œ  
quite possibly would have been s
hot.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
100
 
Q: Is this the shoe you wore?
 
A: No, but this is exactly like the shoe. This 
Œ 
this is a shoe that I wore when I left 
later on, I left the hospital, I was just 
Œ 
once I discharged. This was my discharged 
shoe.
 
Q: I see.
 
A: How it became torn, I don™t know, but it™s very, very representative of the shoe 
that I wore, which was 
Œ 
had 
been battered around quite a bit
. 
Q: Okay.
 
A: So, I 
Œ 

Q: What does it mean to you, the shoe?
 
A: It says to me that 
Œ  
it reminds me of what I went through, reminds me of the 
s
truggle that I had, and the struggle that 
I 
was able to survive, because this 
Œ 
the 
Œ  
the 
Œ  
the emotional stress that this gave me, was as bad as the physical. To
 
make the 
de
cision. I™m being force
-
marched,
 
I can™t drop out. If I do, may be my death. So 
wh
at do I do? The pain is so incre dibly great. I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I™ve gotta get this shoe off 
my foot. Fortunately, there comes a break.
 

Q: Now we can focus back on him. Did you bre 
Œ 
[break]
Œ 
and you were say 
Œ 
A: Fortunately, we™re stopped along the way, and we™re forced to sit down on the 

side of the road, fortuitous as could be, because I could not have g
one any long 
Œ 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
101
 
any 
Œ  
any longer. And so I made the decision. That was the emotional tug, do you 
take a chance of 
Œ 
of dropping out along the side and trying t
o get that shoe off? If 
they see you, you™re shot. Do you do that, or do you continue, and try to stick it out? 
Take the pain, as bad as it is? And then comes this break, that we™re stopped, and I 
can now take my shoe off. I take it off, I don™t want them to see it, so I throw it over 

a hedge, or some kind of a bush. The only winter garme nt I have is a scarf. I ta ke 

the scarf from around my neck, and I wrap it around the foot. So I have one shoe 
and one scarf, and that™s the way I conduct myself the rest of
 
the time  that I was a 
prisoner.
 
Q: So you walked on a scarf?
 
A: I walked on a scarf, on snow and ice. Periodically, we got some sunshine, and 
some of the snow would melt, so that became wet. It didn™t help the swelling in the 

foot, but at least there was expansion that I didn™t get from the shoe, so I could 

survive the pain. And so, that went on and on.
 
Q: Did they find out that you were Jewish?
 
A: No.
 
Q: They never did, huh?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
102
 
A: No. Again, defiance, that
 
I™m 
Œ  
I™m going to 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I will do it. If they had e
ver 
interrogated me, I would have 
Œ  
I would probably have been required to show my 
dog tags, at which time the others, that were attached to them 
Œ 
Q: Sure.
 
A: 
Œ  
would have 
Œ 
would have shown. So I
 
had no reservation in that, but once you 
become a slave laborer, you™re not 
Œ 
you™re not anything. You™re not registered, and 
they don™t care about your dog 
Œ 
dog tags, they don™t care what you are, you just 
work, or you die. That™s just as si
-
simple as that. So ha
-
had they insisted I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I 
identify myself, of course I would have. But the fact that I didn™t, what it would 
have meant, would I be 
Œ 
have
 
sacrificed my life? I don™t know. Would I 
have been 
sent
? Chances are I might have gone to a slave labor camp. Chances are
 
[indecipherable]
 
something like 
Berg
a
, w here so many of the Jewish soldiers were 
sent.
 

Q: Jewish American, yeah.
 
A: But that would have been 
Œ  
that would have been a lifesaver. As bad as the 
treatment was, the tre at 
Œ 
treatme nt at 
Berg
a
 
was harsh, terribly harsh
. And 
Œ 
but 
yet, I would not have been subjected to the exposure that I 
Œ 
that I was. So that 
might have happened.

Q: So, in this time 
Œ 
[break] 
Okay. So, during these 88 days, is that how many you 
were sleeping on the ground?
 
A: I 
Œ  
I™ll e xplain. There were 90 days altogether. I™ll explain where the other six 
days 
Œ  
other 10 days come in. And just 
Œ 
I was just about to get to that.
 
Q: What was my question, oh my. In this time, you had neither a name, nor a 
number 
Œ 
A: Right.
 
Q: 
Œ  
nor 
anything that 
Œ 
no 
Œ  
you were anonymous to your captors.
 
A: Anonymous, I was 
Œ 
I was not a human being.
 
Q: Mm
-
hm. How did they 
Œ  
did they yell at people, did they kick them, did they 
Œ 
how did they behave?

. Yes, there were shouts in 
German. We got to know what they
Œ  
what they meant. And usually the ri 
Œ 
the rifle 
p 
Œ  
the point of the rifle usually was the indication of what we were supposed to do. 
Go this way, go that way, get up, up, down, down. They used that most often, but 
there were a few German expressions that they use, and we got to know what they 

meant.
 
Q: So
 
raus
 
means get up, get out.
 
A:

what 
Œ  
what in the world that 
meant. I don™t know, but they used to yell it an awful lot. And I guess, maybe get 
regimented, get in line, get wa

whatever it was. But I just did whatever the 
other
s did, and wa

and that™s the

the

what they wanted, fine.
 
Q: Were there any 
Œ 
did you ever
 
find out whether there were any other Americans 
in this particular colon 
Œ  
colony, or column of slave laborers?
 
A: I am quite certa in there were other Americans. There was no buddy

system.
 
Q: No.

I knew
 
so many different troops, I don

we

there was not even a buddy system, because you were 
constantly living to survive for yourself. And I was about to get to that now 
Œ 
Q: Okay, fine.
 

A: 
Œ  
the next 
Œ  
the next stage. Now the tide of battle turned. The allied forces had 
regrouped, they were driving the Germans back. They had to move us faster. They 
Œ  
boxcars. T hose same boxcars that transported Jews and others to the concentration 

camps, that was where 
Œ 
that was our destiny.

Q: Okay, go ahead.
 
A: There™s one thing I wa 
Œ 
wanted to mention to
o
, that I didn™t, that made trave l 
during these forced marches, more  difficult. Most of the marches were at night.
 
The 
railroad tracks were carried
 
at night. Some of them were in the daytime. When they 
were,
 
often, we were fired up
on
 
by allied airc raft. From 10,000 feet in the air, you 
can™t distinguish the s 
Œ 
the soldiers marching, are they British, American, or 
German uniform? You can™t tell from the air. And they would fire on us.
 
Q: Did they ever hit?
 
A:
 
Huh? Oh yeah, yeah, they hit some. Some were killed. And that was very, very 
difficult to take.
 
Even worse 
Œ 
well, I shouldn™t say even worse, but also, 
emotionally, what really hit me so much, and maybe the others, the physical aspect, 
of course, the dan ger of being sh
-
shot and killed was bad enough. But when I saw 
those plane
s 
finish their run 
Œ 
and mind you, I knew something about the air force, 
because we all 
Œ  
I and those who were with me at the time, wanted to become 
pilots. And I s 
Œ  
they swooped do
wn, and they 
Œ 
they did their firing. When their 
run was over, when they be 
Œ 
they proceeded ahead of t
he train, then I saw them 
make the
 
big U
-
turn, I knew they were heading back to their base in 
England
. 
There were officers in those planes, and I knew th ey were going to the officers™ 

clubs. And what were they going to do? They were going to get a nice, comfortable

couch, warm room, cocktail, food, cigar. Nice, nice life. The frustration in realizing 
what they were going to, and we had 
Œ  
I had 
Œ  
had no fut
ure at that time. I didn™t 
know what was going to happen. I didn™t know if I would be alive, dead, escape
d
, 
whatever. Didn™t know. So that was terribly frustrating, emotionally. It tore a t me in 

some respe cts, even more than the physical aspect of it. So n
ow, we™ve co 
Œ  
we™re 
continuing, we™re working on these railroads, or sabotaging them, and the tide of 

battle does turn. We™re now forced into these cattle cars. All it has, one big sliding 
door, no windows, no lights. And we™re pushed in 
Œ 
they™re called 40 and eights. 
Eight horses can fit in, 40 humans. We were about 80. We were packed in, bodies 
stacked against body. And I knew 
Œ 
some people used to criticize me, on something 
so cliché, you said you were packed in like sardines? Well, it™s a 
Œ 
it™s a 
Œi
t™s just 
probably the be 
Œ 
most apt description I can give, because just the way they l
-
lay, 
one over another. That™s the way we were sta cked. And there was no room to sit. 

Once a day, that door would slide open, and they would throw in some crusts of 
brea
d. By this time, we™re all quite weak. It 
Œ 
we could
n™t
 
attack one another with 
enough strength to harm, or certa inly to kill one another, but we had be 
Œ 
we did 
become a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a pack of of animals. We clo 
Œ  
we crawled and clawed our way to 
those scraps of
 
bread. As soon as a man got a scrap in his hand, he thrust it into his 
mouth; the hunger was fierce. The 
Œ 
we had no 
Œ 
no bathroom facilities, we use d

our helmets. You can guess what the atmosphere was like in that car, 80 humans. 
Some starte d to die, some did die in the car. Some wou 
Œ  
became mentally 
deranged. Were they out of their minds? I don™t know. But they certainly were 
Œ 
had no mental stability. And that™s what we lived with for six days and nights.
 
Q: Oh my goodness.
 
A: 
So when I say this kind o
f slave labor is distinguished from any kind of 
treatment in captivity, in probably 
Œ  
in possibly any war. Finally, on the end of the 
six days, that big door is swung open. They pull us out, and now it™s a forced 
march. I only have one shoe, and I can™t endure another march, certainly on sn
ow 
and ice. I have to make a decision. I always knew that one option was escape, if a 
time or situation presented itself. And I said, this is it.
 
We were being 
Œ 
we were 
put 
in 
Œ  
in lines for forced march
. I looked and sa
w w
here the guards were positioned, 
here, here, so forth. It occurred to me that if we came to a curve in the road, there 
would be maybe five to 10 seconds where we would be 
Œ 
not be vi 
Œ  
we, where we 
were situated, would not be visible to a guard. There were two others near me. I 

don™t recall that I had any particular connection with them at a ll, but they were the 

nearest to me.
 
And so I told
 
them what I had whispered the 
Œ 
watch, and
 
they made 
sure the guards don™t see, and I would call them,
 
when I give a nod, like this. And 
we got to that position, when the guards were separated that far, I gave a nod, and

the three of us threw a 
Œ 
threw a 
Œ  
there was a 
Œ  
a hedge, some 
Œ 
something 
Œ  
some 
growth of some sort, we threw ourselves over it, and just lay there. I think the 
troops behind us, recognizing what we did, used discretion, and said, I should clo 
Œ 
we should close up. They closed ranks, I think. I™m not sure of that. But the fact that 
we were not detected, that there were no soldiers out searching for us, suggested to 

me that ma ybe that™s what happened.
 
And that saved us. So they marched on by, 
and they were gone. We had gone through a town while we were on the train, not 
too long ago. And we could see through the cracks, there was some thing there, it 
wa
s a some  
Œ 
something, it was not just the treed areas that we had been through, so 
it was probably a village of some sort.
 
Q: So, the train, when you were packed in like sardines, was moving. The cattle car 
was moving during those six days?
 

A: When 
Œ  
when 
we were 
Œ 
at which point?
 
Q: When you™re packed into the cattle ca r 
Œ 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: 
Œ  
like sardines, you™re not stationa
ry for six days 
Œ 
A: Oh, no, no, no, the car 
Œ  
Q: 
Œ  
it™s moving.
 
A: 
Œ  
oh, it™s moving.

Q: It™s moving, okay.
 
A: Mm
-
hm. Oh, it™s moving all
Œ  
all of 
Œ 
most of that time. So we 
Œ  
we then decide 
to go back into this town, it™s not far away. The other two are able to walk. I was on 
twos and fours, the foot, I couldn™t move fast enough on foot, so sometimes on 
fours, and sometimes on all fo 
Œ 
all
 
fo 
Œ  
four 
Œ  
fours,
 
my 
Œ  
just my feet. We cra wl 
into this town, and as we 
Œ 
we™re coming down a hill. I have a picture of it, on back 
behind the screen, I have a picture of that town. I never went back. I kick myself 
many 
Œ  
many, many times for not having gone back, and you™ll hear in a mome nt 
why I wanted to go back there. But somehow, the story of what I went through, got 
out someplace, and in the mail I got two photos of this town, of wise 
Œ 
ri

Reichenbach
. 
Q: 
Reichenbach
. 
A: Right,

towns, from 
Œ 
I don™t know where they came from, somebody, somebody sent them 
to me. And I look at it and try to envision where it was we were 
Œ 
I reme mber we 
crawled down a hill. We get to the bottom of it, and I hear familiar sounds. The kind 

of sounds I heard on the battlefield, tanks, vehicles, moving. We get closer and then 
I see German tanks. I see soldiers all around. We had escaped into a Nazi staging 
area.

Q: Oh, good God.
 
A: If s 
Œ  
if sighted,
 
we would be shot.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: That was the order, no prisoners to be taken alive. And so we had to crawl 
through back alleys. We 
Œ 
we did that. We™re now at the edge of an alley, there™s a 
big open area, and in the distance, there™s some houses. Simple ho
uses. One house 
just catched my attention, it™s painted white. And I say to these other two, that™s a 
safe house. They look at me. How do you know it™s a sa fe house? I don™t know how 
I know, but I know. So they s 
Œ 
no other choice, all right, we™ll go along. We wait 
until we see no 
Œ  
no soldiers nearby, and we crawl as fa st as we c 
Œ 
we 
Œ  
they ran, I 
crawled as fast as I could, out to the door of that house. We needed some kind of 

shelter, it™s 
still cold. Needed some food. Knock on the door, and a young ma
n, 
probably in his early teens, comes to the door. He takes one look at me, you know, 

I™m 
Œ  
I™m 
Œ  
I™m filthy, beard, hair is shaved, I 
Œ 
I contracted lice. And one other 
element tha t we had to fight, lice had covered 
Œ  
covered my body, and many of the 
men 
had that.
 
Q: Even in those cold temperatures.
 
A: Even in those temperatures, lic e on our bodies. But so my head was shaved. So I 
had bristles, I just 
Œ 
just 
Œ  
dirty face, and just torn, the clothes were torn. And he 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015

doesn™t know what to do. Looks at us. And I try to explain who we are, I don™t think 
he knew. He starts to c lose the door. I have one good foot and shoe, I stick the left 

foot in the door. And then I hear voices from the rear. They sound like elderly 
people. And he motioned for them to come to t
he door. They do, and it is this 
elderly couple. I notice the man takes a look on the jacket, I have a 
U
.
S
. emblem, 
and he looks at it, and there™s a 
Œ 
a smile on his face. I say, what 
Œ 
what 
Œ  
what 
Œ  
what™s he smiling about? We™re desperate here, and he™s
 
smiling at us. He comes 
walking out to the porch, to look up and down, to see if there are any soldiers. He 
then takes us 
Œ 
he then motions 
Œ 
he sees no soldiers 
Œ 
if they™re captured 
Œi-
if 
Œ  
if 
Œ  
if 
Œ  
if the g 
Œ 
if the German soldiers come by, and we were in their house with 
them, not only would we be shot, they would be shot as traitors. In all likelihood, 

that™s what would happen. So he has to look out and see if there are any soldiers. 

None there. Motions for us to come in, and his wife joins us. She sees our condition, 

and almost without saying anything, she goes, I guess, to the kitchen, and she comes 
out with three ladles of so 
Œ 
ladles and some 
Œ 
some kind of cups of some sort, of 
hot soup, with a piece of meat in it. Perception on her part, she see s the condition, 
and she recognizes, more than anything. To us, just seeing a living quarters, it was 
so startling. I re 
Œ 
I re member just 
Œ 
just standing there, even before taking the food, 
and just looking. There were curtains, drapes, carpeting, furniture, lamps. We 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
112
 
hadn™t seen that in a long time, we were living just in the outdoors alone. So that 
was striking. But then, the food was so delect 
Œ 
just absolutely delectable. I 
Œ 
normally when you™re hungry, you 
Œ  
you gulp it down. But I 
Œ 
I savored it, just the 
taste of food, was so great. After they fed us, we talk
e
d for a little bit. Amazingly, 
they spoke reasonable English. Why did they want to save us? Some years earlier, 

this couple had traveled to 
America
. They spent time in 
Pittsburgh
,
 
Pennsylvania
. 
Their experience with Americans, and 
America
, was so good, when he saw that 
emblem, th at™s what made him smile. And that™s what probably 
Œ  
probably got 
them to take the risk of bringing us into their home, and take 
Œ 
and take 
Œ 
you 
know, and feeding us. 
After that experience, they then knew that they couldn™t keep 
us there. They got a piece of paper, and they drew a map, showing us alleyways to 

go through. We could hear shellfire, not 
Œ  
not sma ll arms fire yet, but we knew we 
were fairly close to allied lines. And they knew too, that the allies were near. So, if 

they could get us to a safe place, they thought that in a few days, the way the allies 
were moving, from reports they had, I guess, heard, or whatever, we would be 
rescued.
 

Q: The two were 
Œ 
who we
re with you, were American, or not?
 
A: Oh yes.
 

Q: Oh, so you were three America ns.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max

A: They were two 
Œ 
there were 
Œ 
there were three americ  
Œ 
three American boys, 
yeah.
 
Q: Okay.
 
A: So, they drew a map, and we followed that map, crawled through back alleys, 
to 
Œ  
to a barn. We craw
Œ 
got into that barn, we pulled ourselves up into a hayloft. I 
don™t remember how long we were there, two days, three days, just don™t 

reme mber, no sense of time. But I do remember 
Œ 
I think it was a 
Œ  
the first 
morning, I heard some scurrying down below. I separated the hay and looked 

through a crack. I saw a scene that is as clear today as that 
Œ 
as that scene I 
mentioned earlier, of the Germans standing over us with the guns. That is so clear. I 
see a stool, I see a cow, and I see
 
sitting on that stool, it must have been a German 
soldier. Now, he had his top of his uniform off, and I could see that long, white 
underwear, extending out of his black pants. Underwear, and black suspenders 

stretched over the underwear, and then the big, black boots he was wearing. And 
he™s milking a cow. I stirred a little bit, and some hay falls through the crack. This is 
Œ  
this is like a mo 
Œ  
a movie, you know, because 
Œ 
an
-
and I have to w 
Œ  
I watch, I™m 
almo 
Œ  
almost breathless, waiting to see where 
that 
Œ  
if it lands in front of him, that 
hay, he 
Œ  
he 
Œ  
he is likely 
Œ 
all likelihood, he is going to know
 
there™s something up 
there, and whatever the consequences might be. Might he shoot, might he summon

troops? Whatever it would be, it probably would not be good for us. Because again, 
no prisoners taken alive. We were
 
obviously Americans. But it 
[indecipherable]
 
behind him. So, it™s of no real consequence, but I have that image of him. Must 
have been a day or so later, we™re lying in that hay, and again, aware that we™re not 
far from the allied troops, I™m looking down an alleyway, through 
Œ 
must have 
been, you know, maybe it™s a knothole, but I s 
Œ 
I can see down there to 
Œ 
down 
there. At the end of that alleyway, something goes by 
Œ  
some
one goes by, an
d he™s 
wearing a helmet. Could be a German soldier, but then again, that helmet looks 

familiar. It looks like our helmet. I™m not sure, and I wait, and I tell them. They 
Œ  
they 
Œ  
they don™t know whether to believe me , I said, I think the American are here.
 
You 
Œ  
you™re delirious. You™re delirious, then 
Œ 
they 
couldn™t be, we™re not that 
close yet. A few minutes later, a  vehicle rolls by, and I see 
Œ 
[phone ringing]
 
[break]
 
Q: Okay, so you think that it™s the American army troops that you see through that 
li
ttle peephole 
Œ 
A: I see 
Œ 
Q: 
Œ  
your guys don™t.
 
A: I don™t 
Œ 
I™m not sure yet. I see that helmet, it looks familiar, 
it 
looks like my 
helmet.

Q: Yeah.
 
A: I think it might well be. And they think I™m delusional, because they couldn™t be 
that close yet. A few minutes later, I see a  vehicle go by, and it looks like a 
Jeep
. 
Not only is it a 
Jeep
, I see that white sta r on the hood. That™s an American 
Jeep
. 
Yes, they are here. This time, they believe me . I say 
Œ 
we roll out of that hayloft, we 
literally roll, we™re so weak at this time, and I™m almost deli 
Œ 
delirious. We™re so 
Œ 
you know, we 
Œ  
the condition we were in. And I remember just rolling down that 
alleyway, and there, American soldiers, Third Armored Infantry division.
 
Q: Excuse me.
 
A: I don™t even hear
 
it. Fortunately, I don™t. But the Third Armored Infantry 
division, again, 
Patton
™
s 
Third Army, the 
Œ 
we were the first Americ ans they had 
come across. They couldn™t treat us with enough kindness. They tried to feed us. 

The first thing they thought of 
Œ  
th
ey were obviously not nutritionists, was 
chocolate. Bad, very bad. And then, any food they could get into us, they did. I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
as I say, I was in very bad shape by then, I was mildly delirious. I couldn™t 
Œ 
I 
couldn™t carry on a conversation with them. As
 
I think I mentioned, we were the 
first Americans that they came ac ross, so they treated us as well as they could.

Q: Okay, I™m interrupting at this point. I don™t need to go into many graphic details, 
but it™s an unanswered question. When you say the choc
olate was bad, what was 

bad about the chocolate?
 
A: The sweetness of it, it just 
Œ  
we reacted, the stomach somehow, whatever the 
system is
, 
that does whatever it does with your food after you™ve eaten it, it just 
didn™t take to chocolate very well. It 
Œ 
I 
think the fact tha t it was rich, instead of just 
plain, ordinary taste, probably a leafy vegetable would have been easier to take. But 
that made 
Œ 
the other two, I think, were sick, I was just delirious 
Œ 
Q: Okay.
 
A: 
Œ  
so I don™t remember what happened. But, the troops almost cradled us in their 
arms, because again, you know, we were almost out of 
Œ 
out of it.
 
Q: You weren™t able to tell them your story, at this point.
 
A: I couldn™t 
Œ 
I couldn™t 
Œ 
I couldn™t talk, I 
Œ 
I couldn™t 
Œ 
I didn™t want to tell them
 
anything, I was just, again, semi
-
delirious, and just hung there. They saw the 
Œ 
the 
right foot, with the 
Œ 
Q: Scarf.
 

A:

rag wrapped around it, and they knew there was something wrong there. They 
rushed me to a field hospital. It wa s a hospital very simila r to, those who have seen

under very, very difficult conditions, but providing great, great service to men 
wounded on the battlefield. So, I don™t remember where the operation took place, 

whether it was in the field hospital 
Œ 
because my mind went blank. I did learn 
afterward, that from that field hospital, I was sent to the first general hospital in 

Liege
, 
Belgium
. And from there, transferred to the first general hospital in 
Pari
s
,
 
France
. I don™t remember any of that, at all, because as I say, I was delirious by
 
that time. I don™t remember where the surgery was done on my foot, whether it was 
in 
Liege
,
 
Belgium
, or in the field hospital. But they did, they had to cut away. The 
foot 
Œ  
bottom of the foot was all black, and it would have continued on up my leg, 
and I probably would have lost part of the le g. So the timing was just right, and they 

Œ  
they caught it, but then I spent 
as 
Œ  
I™d say,
 
a month 
Œ 
a month to a month and a 
half,
 
in the hospitals in 
Œ 
in 
Europe
. 
Q: So, you lost a part of your foot?
 
A: Yeah, the flesh of the foot, 
oh, it
 
was 
Œ  
it 
was bandaged for a long while, and the 
flesh had to grow back.
 
Q: So you didn™t lose toes?
 
A: Pardon?
 
Q: Did you lose toes?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max

A: I didn™t lose any toes, no, no. But as I say, much late r than that, I™m quite c ertain 
I would have lost 
Œ 

Q: Yeah, of course.
 
A: 
Œ  
some part of my foot.
 
Q: Of course. Gangrene sets in.
 
A: Gangrene, it would have set in.
 

Q: Yeah.
 
A: I had both frostbite and trench
 
fo
ot
, and the combination is wicked, because 
trench foot, you know, that™s wet, and then frostbite free zes it, so an awf
-
awful 
combination to go through. But, in this ho 
Œ  
in the hospital, in 
Œ 
in 
Paris 
Œ  
as I sa y, 
I was there for about a month, they couldn™t get my fever down. In one of the ex 
Œ 

one of the times when we were in these forced marches, when I was a slave laborer, 

twice during that time, at night, instead of sle eping 
Œ 
when I say 80 out of 90 nights, 
six of them were in the

Q: Right.
 
A: 
Œ  
car,
 
the train 
Œ 
Q: Right.
 
A: 
Œ  
and the other two, I don™t remember other two. I came, maybe it was 82 out of 
90. But two nights we did sleep in 
Œ 
in barns. And in one of the barns was a cow
, 

 
Interview with Robert Max

wa 
Œ  
one man
 
who came to be my friend, my buddy, long after the war 
Œ 
we 
correspond every Christmas, we se nd greeting cards to each other, and 
Myron
 
would send me 
Œ 
Myron Berringer
(ph), a farmer from 
Rush
ville
, 
Indiana
. On that 
card he would always say the same thing, year after year after year, things sure 
aren™t like they used to be. And all of that. 
Myron
 
called me over, lie down 
[indecipherable]
 
under the cow, under the udder of the cow. He milked directly 
into my mouth 
Œ 
Q: Oh my gosh.
 
A: 
Œ  
from that cow. So, along with 20 other diseases I c ontracted 
Œ 
out of that litt
le 
brown book that I me ntioned before, where it has the 84 foods?
 
Q: Right.
 

A: I have about 20 diseases, illne sses, fevers that I contracted during the 10 months 

of hospitalization. One of them was undulant fever. Now we didn™t 
Œ 
in the hospital 
in 
France
, 
in 
Paris
, they didn™t know what it was, but I had a raging fever. It was 
caused by that incident with the cow, it was undulant fever. No doctor, no military 

doctor was able to discover what it was. That kept me from going 
Œ 
getting back to 
America
, because they couldn™t 
Œ 
they were going to fly me, which they did, I 
Œ 
I 
flew in a hospital plane. They wouldn™t do that until they got the fever down, and 

they couldn™t get it down. Finally, they did force it down enough to get me on a 

 
Interview with Robert Max

plane and over to 
America
. Years l 
Œ 
years la ter, I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I finished college, I™m 
working now, and I broke out in a sweat. Like the body just opened, water just 
poured out, and these little red dots all over. The doctor called it pete
chiae
, and this 
was a result of that incident. How was it discovered? The doctor that I 
Œ 
I had that 
night, was substituting for another doctor. He was young, he was an intern, and he 

immediate ly saw 
Œ 
thought that I had a contagious disease. And I was 
Œ 
and he 
ordered an ambulance, they took me immediately, that night, from home, to i 
Œ 
Belleville
,
 
New Jersey
, to a 
Œ 
a hospital where children with polio were. It was an 
isolation hospital. And I was put on the isolation floor, with these children. I was 

there a full month. My wife
 
Shirley
 
could only see
 
me during that month, through 
glass. I was isolated because he thought that I had this contagious disease.
 
Q: Did you?
 

A: No. No. Fortunately, the doctor in that isolation hospital was very thorough, and 

very smart. He said, you have this raging fever, and you™re going to continue to get 
these attacks. We have to find out what you have. We 
Œ 
so he says, I™m going to ask 
you a lot of questions. And he was so thorough. He took me through the whole 
campaign.
 
Q: Did he really?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
121
 
A: It turned out that he traced it back to that incident in the barn. He said, I believe 
that you have something that™s ca lled 
Œ 
well, whatever feve 
Œ 
I™ll think 
Œ  
I™ll think 
of it in a 
Œ 
in a few moments. But you have that disease. Now, it™s a 
Mediterranean 
disease. But, I said, I wasn™t
 
in the 
Mediterranean
. He said, but it 
also 
Œ  
this was a very intelligent doctor 
Œ 
it also can be contracted from 
unpasteurized milk. And that is the disease you have, and we can treat that with 

certain such medication. He did, and he cured me of it.
 
Q: An
d you™ve never had it since.
 
A: Never had 
Œ 
never had an attack again. The 
Œ 
I just can™t think of it.
 
Q: So, you were 
Œ  
you had the operation at one of those three hospitals that you 
mentioned to me?
 
A: Yes.
 

Q: The 
Œ 
one thing that I wanted to ask you is 
that you mentioned earlier, your 
brother 
Lester
 
figured in some way in your story here, in your experience here.
 
A: Yes.
 

Q: He himself was in the European theater.
 

A: Yes.
 
Q: Tell me, how did that happen? What was that 
Œ 
what was that connection?
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
122
 
A: Okay. 
When I 
Œ 
in the ba 
Œ  
in the bulge, when I was captured, I was reported as 
missing in action. Standard procedure, a telegram from the War Department to my 
parents. And months go by, these three months go by, and there™s no word. I 
learned later on that my mother had a nervous breakdown, because the assumption 
was, if he™s missing in action, after two month 
Œ 
two months
 
[indecipherable]
 
and 
there™s no word, he must be dead. So that was the 
Œ 
the a
-
assumption. There™s a 
man in charge of communications, another
 
soldier, an American soldier in charge of 
communications
 
for another unit, perhaps another 
Œ 
probably another di 
Œ 
I think 
another division, and a company within that division, he™s the communications 

person. When the report went out that I was missing in
 
action, he learned of that. He 
started to send communication to other units in the area, have they come across a 

Robert Max
? 
Q: 
Robert Max
. 
A: They come 
Œ 
no word. When I finally do get back to allied lines, there™s a report 
Œ  
oh, how did I get back to 
Œ 
I di 
Œ 
I did not comment on how I got back to i 
Œ 
our 
a-
allied lines. Oh, the escape, and then the 
Œ 
the troops
 
and all, so 
Œs
o when I did 
get back, I™m not sure which hospital it was, but it was reported

Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
123
 
A: Yes. Was alive. Word was sent to this person via the interconnection of radio 
Œ 
radio contact
 
with troops through that area, he got word that I was a live. I have the 
original letter now, right behind me,
 
that he wrote to my parents 
Œ 
Q: 
Lester
 
did.
 
A: You can guess 
Œ  
it was my brother, my eight year older brother 
Lester
, who had 
followed my route
 
as a  slave laborer, ma intained the contact, so that when I did 
show up in a hospital, reported alive, he was among the very, very first to get that 
information. And he sat up that night until he couldn™t think any more, and wrote to 
my parents. And I have the original of that letter.
 

Q: That™s a mazing.
 
A: The 
Œ 
the 
Œ  
the odds of something like that happening, the first man to learn that 
you were alive, happened to be your own brother. With millions of troops 
Œ 
Q: That™s right.
 
A: 
Œ  
in the area.
 
Q: So, he was a communications officer? Is that 
Œ 

A: Yes.
 

Q: Okay.
 
A:He 
Œ  
he was a serge ant, he was in charge of communications for his unit.
 
Q: Okay.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
124
 
A: As all c ommunications flowed through him. And strangely enough, the thing that 
got me captured, was trying to find a break in our communications lines. And, 
you 

know, and he™s in another unit, apparently not far 
Œ 
not far away, and he™s in charge 
of communications. But it turns out, the one who cared for me as a child now, is the 

first to 
Œ 
to have pursued the search, and then to learn that his brother is alive.
 
Q: That must have been some letter.
 

A: Well, it™s a beautiful letter. I ha ve it, if you want to read it.
 
Q: I would.
 
A: You c 
Œ 
you can.
 
Q: I would like you to read it.
 
A: Uh
-
huh.
 
Q: Af
-
After we finish the interview 
Œ 
A: Oh, okay.
 
Q: 
Œ  
it would be wonderful.
 
A: All right, sure.
 
Q: Okay, so 
Œ 
so, does he see you when y
ou™re in these hospitals? Is he able to visit 
you?
 
A: No, he™s still in the service.
 
Q: Okay.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
125
 
A: Now, the war in 
Europe 
ends, and many of 
Œ 
many of the soldiers in that war 
are now assigned to units going to 
Japan
. He was assigned to go to 
Japan
. So 
while 
all this is going on, he™s on a boat. He™s 
Œ 
he™s 
Œ  
he™s on a boat going across 
the 
Atlantic
 
first, then he has to cross country. Before he gets 
ŒI
™m
 
not 
Œ  
not chu 
Œ  
before he get 
Œ  
gets to battle any 
Œ 
any battle station, the war with 
Japan
 
ends, and 
so 
he™s free  to come home. And he 
Œ  
I don™t ne 
Œ 
I don™t remember 
Œ 
I don™t 
reme mber how we first became 
Œ 
he™s 
Œ  
how he saw me. I do remember that my 
parents came by, and I was so misshaped. My f 
Œ 
I reme mber, I was in a private 
room because I was 
Œ 
many serious illnesses, and so I 
Œ 
I was in this room, and the 
door is open, and from what I learned later on, my father looks in that room, see s 
me, and just goes right on. Doesn™t recognize me at all. You know, the 
Œ 
obviously 
the face is sunken, and
 
slightly
 
di
storted. I have no hair, because it was shaved. So I 
don™t look like the one he remembers. Many of our relatives who came past the  
door too, never recognized me. I think my mother
 
did
. I think, you know, mother™s 
instinct. I think she 
Œ 
she 
Œ  
she did, but 
that was the beginning, of course, of 10 
Œ 
of 
nine more months of hospitalization.
 
Q: Where were you hospitalized here?
 
A: In this country, in 
Œ 
on 
Staten Island
, part of 
New York City 
Œ 
Q: Right.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
126
 
A: 
Œ  
one of the boroughs, on 
Halloran General Hospital
. It was a milita ry 
hospital, at the time.
 
Q: Were n 
Œ  
when were you in shape 
Œ 
did the army ever ask you the details of 
what had happened to you when you got missing 
Œ  
when you went missing?
 
A: I 
Œ 
Q: Were you ever debriefed, in other words?
 
A: When I was debriefed? When I 
Œ 
not overseas, when I was in the hospital over 
here, a military officer from 
Œ 
came from 
Washington
 
to interview me, but the 
interview was more a bout the war crimes commission, because I witnessed a killing 

of an American soldier. As I™ve said, if you were unable to work, you were either 
left to die, or you were shot. There was an American soldier who could not get up. 
He was just that weak, that sick and this German soldier takes out a gun, shoots 

him. I learned later that this Germa n soldier™s name is 
Eisenhauer
, spelled 
h-a -u -e-
r
, instead of 
o-w-e-r
. Somebody 
Œ  
I don™t remember how I learned it, somebody 
told me, because he was a notoriously bad actor, and so be 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
so I gave testimony 
about that incident. I don™t think I talked about my conditions. I don™t 
Œ 
don™t recall 
that I talked with anybody na 
Œ 
na 
Œ  
officially. I just don™t recall. T hough, while I 
was in the hospital, I remember being awarded the 
Œ 
the Purple Heart, and then a 
second award, with oak 
Œ 
the Oak Leaf clover, and then
 
raised in rank from 
PFC
 
to 

 
Interview with Robert Max

corporal. So, the 
Œ 
you know, there was procedures
, 
and officers ca me by, and 
Œ  
to 
do the things while I™m 
Œ 
while I™m lying in bed, and all that. But I just don™t recall 
anybody questioning me 
Œ  
Q: About your experience.
 
A: 
Œ a
bout the experience. I don™t reme mber at all. And that™s why I ne 
Œ 
I never 
talked about it, for all those years, it™s 53 years 
Œ 

Q: Excuse me, le t™s cut the camera, I™m so sorry. 
[break]
 
So, yes, you said that 
Œ 
was there anybody, or 
Œ  
put it this way, who was the first person you ever really 
told what had happened to you? When was the first time you did that?
 
A: Actually, I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I deviate from what I 
Œ 
what I™ve said to you, that I never talk 
with it 
Œ 
talked about it. When I got back to college 
Œ 
I™m tr
ying to remember the 
name of the unit, but they were a bu 
Œ 
a bunch of old men. And they 
Œ  
they met in, 
you know, there 
Œ  
there 
Œ  
there are groups that mee t. And I think I told you that 
when I got back to college, I had been interviewed on 
Œ 
Q: Right.
 

A: 
Œ  
network radio, and all of that. And 
Œ 
and so there was 
Œ 
there were people 
there on the campus, who knew the experience that I went through, and something 
must have gotten out to this senior men™s group, and all that, so they asked me to 
come to speak. The problem was, first of all, I didn™t know what I was talking 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
128
 
about, you know? I hadn™t really 
Œ 
really, really pulled together my 
Œ 
my 
Œ  
my 
experience over there. But, I did 
Œ 
did talk to them and tell them. The problem was 
that most of them couldn™t hear
 
what I was ta lking about. Some of them had 
Œ  
you 
ever 
Œ  
in 
Œ  
in 
Œ  
in those time s, the re were still some who used ear trumpets.
 
Q: That™s right, that™s right.
 
A: And 
Œ  
and 
what™d I say? And they couldn™t quite get it. And I guess that wa s 
when I decided that nobody™s really intereste d, and I 
Œ 
I don™t want to talk about it. 
Why I to 
Œ 
and I just gave a few 
Œ 
a few highlights, that I was a soldier, and I fought 
on y 
Œ  
but I 
Œ 
I didn™t go into any of the details at a ll, about it. Was just a 
Œ 
a 
soldier™s s
-
st
ory. But that was the only thing, and from that point on, that was when 
I decided, it™s not pleasant, I don™t want to talk about it, and I f 
Œ 
I 
Œ 
I stopped, for 
53 years after that, I didn™t 
Œ  
but wa 
Œ 
over here, when did I decide that I should be 
talking
 
about it? In this room, my 
Œ 
I had two grandsons have, at that time the y 
were seven and nine years old. And one of them sa id 
Œ 
we™re sitting here, and one 
says,
 
Poppy
, were you in the war? And then, between the two of them, they fle 
Œ 
throwing questions at me. What di 
Œ 
where did you sleep, what did you eat? Did 
you have a gun? Did you ever fire it? Did you ever kill anybody? And just 
something is triggering in my mind, as I say, my guess, if these kids are asking, 
maybe I should be talking about it. In 19
88, 
Shirley 
and I, we had set up a 

 
Interview with Robert Max

foundation at 
Ohio University
, to bri 
Œ 
well, it was b 
Œ 
bl 
Œ  
bla 
Œ  
based on religious 
lines,
 
to bring religious ele ments on campus, so there should be no anti
-
Semitism 
and so on. It was a very 
Œ 
a very good thing
 
We f 
Œ 
and so we founded this 
Œ 
this 
organization. One 
Œ 
in ni 
Œ  
in 19 ay 
Œ  
in
 
ninety 
Œ  
we did it before that 
Œ 
in 1988, we 
invited 
Elie W iesel
, 
Elie W iesel
, to come to campus for a weekend, to talk. He 
agreed to do it, because there was a woman, a young woman, a
 
student, a graduate 
student, who had written, and 
Œ  
a 
Œ  
a 
Œ  
I guess her 
Œ 
her papers for her degree, on 
Elie W iese l
, on either hi 
Œ 
one of his books
, or on his life. She died a short time  
afterward. It was 
Œ 
it was an unfortunate illness, from something she ate. He was 
aware of that. I don™t recall how he was made aware of it, but she was someone 
special to him, and he was made a ware, perhaps by his rabbi, who had been a rabbi 
at 
Hillel [indecipherable]
 
University
. And when he and 
Œ 
when he 
Œ 
and he agreed
 
to come, but only on the condition that we me morialize her name. And so he came 

to the campus. I don™t have to tell you 
Œ  
oh, he insisted on certain things being done. 
One, that he speak 
[phone ringing
,
 
break]
 
Q: So you were talking about 
Elie W iesel
.  
A: 
So 
Œ w -
w 
Œ  
so w
-
we 
Œ  
so he 
Œ 
he is the weekend guest, and 
of 
Œ  
and 
Œ  
and 
Shirley
 
and I are also the guests, of the president of 
Ohio University
. We 
Œ 
the 
president™s guest house is turned over to us.
 
Elie W iesel
 
has the master bedroom,

his rabbi has anothe
r bedroom, and there™s a third bedroom for 
Shirley
 
and me. 
Elie 
W iesel 
comes to me, he says, 
Bob
, take the be 
Œ 
master bedroom. I said, I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
oh, I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I couldn™t possibly even fit 
Œ 
think of doing that. That™s your room. He said 
no, no, no, listen to 
me , believe me, take the maste r bedroom. We do. Next morning 
Œ  
and so we go 
Œ  
go to bed at night. The next morning, we come down for 
breakfast. We had ordered 
Œ 
this is a little town, we™d ordered from a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a larger 
city in 
Ohio
, kosher food. Comes the breakfast, he eats a few grapes, you know, he 
doesn™t eat much of 
Œ  
much at all. He eats a few grapes, and all this kosher food that 
we brought in, from 
Columbus
,
 
Ohio
, nothing. He eats nothing. But he said, I hope 
you slept well. I said well, you gave us the room. I said, did you sleep well? He 
said, well, he said, I didn™t 
Œ  
I didn™t stay in the 
Œ 
in this building. Wh
-
Wha
-
What 
Œ  
wha
-
what 
Œ 
where did you go? He said, there was a little motel down the road. He 
asked somebody to make arrangements for him to 
go to the motel. They didn™t have 
any rooms vacant. He had a little hole someplace. There was room enough for his 
typewriter and him, and I guess maybe a place to lie down. I said, you spent last 
night there? Why? Why would you do that? He said, I didn™t w
ant to wake you up. 

What do you mean wake us? He said, I do my writing, a lot of my writing 
Œ 
Q: At night.

A: 
Œ  
at mid 
Œ 
in the mid 
Œ  
middle of the night, in the morning, 2:30, 3:30, any time 
like that. He used a typewriter. He said, if I were writing at night, I would keep you 
awake. Imagine this man, I would keep you awake. So I went out of my way to go 
down to this little mote l, I spent the night there. I was pleased, and I could do some 
writing. He slept very, very little. My guess is probably maybe three, four hours a 

night, at most. Ate very little. And 
Œ 

Q: Quite a story.
 
A: 
Œ  
it was a 
Œ 
but this af
tŒ  
huh?
 
Q: Quite a story.
 
A: 
Incredible, the per
-
per
-
personality of 
Œ 
of 
Œ  
of this man. So here we are, now it™s 
Saturday afternoon. We™re in the living room of the president™s guest house. There 

are three people there, 
Shirley
, me, and 
Elie W iesel
. And I™m 
Œ 
I™m really 
mesmerize d by him. I am not 
Œ 
up to that time, I still had not, other than that thing 
with the 
el
-
el
-
elderly group, I had still not talked,
 
and I didn™t want to talk. If there 
was anybody I suppose I should have talked with about my experiences, I guess it™s 

Elie W iese l
. I think I was intimidated, or either that, or I didn™t think it would be 
very important to him, based on what he had gone through, and what he had done. 
And so, I never talked about it with him. But just being in the room with him, and 
talking other things with him, was, you know, I mean, a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
a thrill beyond 

 
Interview with Robert Max

anything I can imagine. When I was influenced by the two boys, I attribute it also, 
the fact ma ybe that sm 
Œ 
meeting with 
Elie W iesel
 
suggested to me, just as he had 
been talking about his experiences, maybe I should be doing th 
Œ  
maybe I should be 
doing the same thing.
 
Q: Did 
Shirley
 
know everything?
 
A: No, I don™t think I ever talked with her about it, no. She only learned while we 

were d 
Œ 
writing the book.
 
Q: Wow.
 
A: Although that she did go to a lo 
Œ 
so 
Œ  
a lot of the presentations that I talked. So 
she learned, she learned that way abou 
Œ 
about it. And occasionally
, you know, 
we™ll be having dinner or something, and something would occur to me, and I 

would make some refe rence to the war. But 
Œ 
so 
Œ  
so, I think, when the kids started 
talking 
Œ  
and then I™m thinking 
Elie W iesel
, a nd then I reali 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I re alized, we 
h
ave a Holocaust council here in the 
Œ 
in our federation, and Holocaust education is 
mandated in 
New Jersey
. Now, I™m not a Holocaust survivor, but I survived maybe 
the equivalent to sa 
Œ 
to most of the survivors
, and maybe 
Œ 
maybe in some se nse, 
maybe even
 
worse. Not those who went to the death camps, of course, nothing 
compared with that. But at least, may 
Œ 
and maybe 
Œ 
maybe this is a story that 
should be preserved. I didn™t know it was unique at the time, and I really didn™t 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
133
 
know until 
Heidi
 
became my editor, and she did a lot of research
, a nd the man in 
charge of 
Œ 
of th 
Œ 
of press for the city of 
Newark
, was also a World War II 
historian.
 
Q: Yeah, you mentioned him to me.
 
A: I mentioned him. And so he di 
Œ  
he did a lot of research too, so he
Œ  
he though
t 
there was something unique about it. But an
-
anyway, it was that combination. And 
then somehow 
Œ  
and I don™t 
Œ 
I don™t know how, the head of our Holocaust council 
got word of my experience, and induced me to start talking to the school kids. So 
when I learned that that™s what they were doing in 
New Jersey
, so these young 
people would grow up as being witnesses for the future, that seemed an imperative, 
and that™s when I decided, time to start talking. And if you 
don™t 
Œ 
may 
Œ  
make you 
feel any happier, I don™t hear that over here. You feel 
Œ 
reme mber, you feel it. Oh, 
dear. So that was the 
Œ 
that was what urged me.
 
Q: And that was 50 year 
Œ 
more than 50 years later?
 
A: Oh yeah, that was 53
 
years later, that I started talking.
 
Q: So that would have been like
 
10 years ago, you would have started talking?
 
A: I™ve been doing it for about 10 years, right 
Œ 

Q: Wow.
 
A: 
Œ  
right. And 
Œ 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
134
 
Q: One other thing that I want to ask is, those 90 to a hundred days, what was 
different about the person who came out of that, than the person who went into that?
 
A: Was a totally different individual. I went 
Œ 
I went in as a 
Œ 
a 
Œ  
as a kid, very 
unsophisticated. And I knew something, because I did read newspapers, did know 

about the war, and about concentration camps, and things of th at nature, and a little 

bit of politics. But 
Œ 
but I was rea lly very, very unsophisticated, and had no 
particular design on life, I didn™t know wha
-
what I wanted to be. So, very unsettled, 
I was still a  student, and that was 
Œ 
that was all. My Jewish life was pretty much set 
by my mother, so I knew I had to go to synagogue, even though it was done in 

extreme form, like a Orthodoxy, and all that. But my shi 
Œ  
but my mother insisted, 
and I was brought up, you know, as a 
Œ 
as a good Jew. But when I 
Œ 
af
-
after 
going 
through what I did, I don™t know what the maturation design was, but when I lie in 

Œ  
in the hospital bed for those 10 months, I had many sleepless nights. Now, a lot of 
them were because of physical conditions, and the pain was such that it was ha rd 
to 
sleep. But the others were just e motional, I 
Œ 
just thinking, thinking, thinking, 
constantly. Some of that thinking would go back to incidents that took place during 
the war. I constantly had an image of this elderly couple. I had an image of the 
helmet
 
of that sergeant, and I kept reaching for 
Œ 
trying to 
Œ  
trying to get his face. 
And I couldn™t 
Œ  
couldn™t 
Œ  
couldn™t get aw
ay from 
Œ 
from reme mbering that, and 

 
Interview with Robert Max

what 
Œ  
what 
Œ  
what I went through with him, and how 
Œ 
and the great good fortune 
that I had, that it happened to be somebody like that
, who
 
was a humanitarian, as 
Œ 
as 
Œ a-a-
as well as a 
Œ 
a good soldier, I guess, and you know. He recognized valor, 
a-
and so, 
I 
Œ  
I 
had thoughts about them, and some of the instances, sometime s I 
would get an image of that tank, like an ogre, a big monster, with that cannon. But 
more 
Œ  
more often though, my thinking was about the future 
Œ 
wha 
Œ  
wa 
Œ  
what ha 
Œ  
how 
Œ  
how 
Œ  
how 
Œ  
wha
-
wha
t-
what i 
Œ  
what i
s ordained, what am I supposed to 
do? I mean, it™s 
Œ 
it™s 
Œ  
it™s going
 
to be a total change. Sure, I™m gonna go back to 
school, then I have to go to work, and all of that. But my life, somehow, it just feels 

very, very different. I™m not the person I was before. I™m much more mature, for 
one thing. I was a kid when I went in, now I™m reasonably mature, and I start to 
think. I was very, very lucky, as 
Œ  
as when I 
Œ 
when I talk to senior audiences, very 
often men will come up and surround me, and say, your life was a miracle. You 
Œ 

you should have been killed many, many times, but you™re still he re. So that 
Œ 
that 
thought ran through my head, and there was something urging me inside. I 
Œ 
I don™t 
know what it 
Œ 
I don™t know what it was, but I 
Œ 
I knew I had to respond in some 
way, to what I had been through. And that some way hap
pened to turn out to 
devoting the rest of my life to Jewish causes, Jewish interests. When I was 83, I had 

my second Bar Mitzvah, which is in the book, incidentally, my second Bar Mitzvah, 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
136
 
how that 
Œ 
how that came about. It™s 
Œ  
it™s quite rare . Very, very few Jewish men 
have a second Bar Mitzvah.
 
Q: What is the purpose of a second Bar Mitzvah?
 
A: The purpose of it is, back in 
Œ  
in 
David
™
s 
time, bibli 
Œ 
[phone ringing
,
 
break]
 
Q: So, you were saying 
Œ 
A: According to the psalms 
Œ 
Q: Okay.
 
A: In King
 
David
™
s
t
ime, longevity was considered to be 70 years. If a man lived 
beyond 70, he started life all over again. And so, 70, and recognizing that the age of 

Bar Mitzvah for boys is usually 13, so you figure, if 70, life begins again, 13 years 
added to that, 83. So at age 83, a Jewish man become
s 
eligible for a second Bar 
Mitzvah.
 
Q: And how does that change from the first Bar Mitzvah? What™s different?
 
A: Oh, it™s a world of difference. It™s a to
-
totally different world. It™s always been 
my belief that 13 may be a little bit too young for a boy to understand the ritual 
that 
he was going through, and the me 
Œ 
what it meant to become 
Œ  
because you 
assumed new responsibility in life, 
a 
more ma ture responsibility, and you™re 
responsible for your actions, and your future.
 
And you 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I find that hard, at 13, 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
137
 
to be able to think that way. So 83, not only 
you have 
Œ 
you™re well beyond that 
point 
Œ 
Q: Right.
 
A: 
Œ  
you™ve been thinking 
Œ 
thinking of your 
Œ  
your life, and planning for many, 
many years. But your whole perspective on life is different, because you™ve had a 
life experience. In my case, I had an unusual life experience, the military life, a nd I 

had a ga 
Œ  
an interesting Jewish experience, too, because my family, my mother 
was rigid about it. We were not Orthodox, but we were Reform, but nevertheless, it 

occupied a big, big part of her life, and became part of my life.
 

Q: It™s like an identity.
 
A: So a ritual was important. Pardon?
 
Q: It™s an identity, it™s the forming of an identity.
 
A: Exactly. I had 
Œ 
had a strong
 
Jewish i
-i-
ident 
Œ  
identity. So that I knew that I 
wanted the thing 
Œ 
to do things spiritually, but more in terms of aiding pe 
Œ  
aiding 
people. If I survived what I did, there are other people who had difficult times, a nd I 

ought to be able to do so 
Œ 
do 
things that would be helpful to those people. The bar 
Œ  
Bar Mitzvah was more symbolic than anything. It allowed me to restate  my 
Œ  
my 
Œ  
my Jewishness.
 
Q: Yeah.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
138
 
A: And, as I say, it had meaning, it would 
Œ  
had me 
Œ  
real meaning. It was the first 
time I had read from our sacred Torah. And that had a lot of meaning, because when 
I was 13, in Reform congregation, we didn™t 
Œ 
the boy didn™t read from the Torah. 
This was my first opportunity to do that. So I learned to read Hebrew without the 

vowels underneath, a
nd 
you had 
Œ 
were
 
either experience
d
, or were very adept at 
learning how to do it. And I did learn. It was my wife
 
Shirley
, who came up with
 
the idea. She said, 
Bob
, you™re 83 now, you know, you could 
Œ 
you could have a 
second Bar Mitzvah.
 
I™d like you to have it. And so I did it, to a larg e extent, for 
her, because she wanted it. We had a rabbi at the time, who 
Œ  
who agreed
Œ  
agreed 
abs
-
absolutely. And I spent sessions with her, preparing for it. And we 
Œ 
it was the 
most 
Œ  
probably the most exciting event in my life.
 
Q: Oh my.
 
A: Well, I guess I have to say, se cond to my marriage. But 
Œ 
but it wa 
Œ 
it wa 
Œ 
it 
wa 
Œ  
so exciting to be 
Œ 
now I felt more totally encompassed within the realm of 
Jewishness. The things that I did in life, first of all, I 
Œ 
I became
 
president of two 
synagogues, and wherever I went, we were so deeply involved. 
Shirley
 
every bit as 
involved, and you see in her obituary how totally committed she was to Jewish 
causes. 
She sat federation boards, women™s division boards, worked for 
organiz
ations that were nationwide 
Œ 
Jewish nationwide, worldwide. Served on the 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
139
 
Œ  
on those boards, and on committees, and all that. So, totally engaged. Well, that 
was my 
Œ 
my role, too. I assume d the presidency of the state a ssociation of Jewish 
Œ 
all Jewish federations in 
New Jersey
, there were 16 at the time . You know, those 
kinds of roles.
 
Q: And you think 
Œ  
yeah 
Œ  
you think that if it hadn™t been for this experience, that 
your life probably wouldn™t have taken that direction?
 
A: I think that is probably the case. I 
Œ 
I would not 
Œ 
I do 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I don™t see how I 
would have had any opening to that. I knew things about Jewish life, and Jewish 
philanthropy, that I learned only late 
Œ 
later on. I didn™t know as a 
Œ 
a youngster, 
and maybe I never would have come acro ss it. The fact that I became president of 
Hillel
, a Je wish international organization, did help me a great deal, in 
understanding that a Je wish life is important, and saving j 
Œ 
other Jewish lives is 
important, too. So, when it came time to set up different type of operations, I set up 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
I 
Œ  
congregational life was 
Œ 
was important. I 
sat 
on a number of different 
boards. I did fundraising for United Jewish Appeal, because that money went not 

just to people in need, an
-
an
-
and in many ca 
Œ  
in some cases, not even to just 
Jewish causes, cause many of the things that we did as Jews, went for the public at 
large. Many of our operations are required even by statute in the state, to serve other 
people™s needs. Jewish family se rvice, Jewish vocational service. Social servic e 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
140
 
agencies like that do provide services to people who are not Jewish. So, that was 
what I was committed. One of the places I 
Œ 
I became very much involved in, was 
the Daughters of 
Israe l
 
Geriatric Center. This was a home for the aged. I had ag
ing 
parents. I ha 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I got to know the age 
Œ 
the aged there. They had lived full lives, 
now they were in the la st stages of their lives. I served there for about 15 years, I 

was vice
-
president there. So 
Œ 
but getting to know them. So one of the kinds of
 
things that I set up, with another member of our Jewish community who had owned 
some department store s and all that, we decided we wanted to do things for elderly 
people, the late stages of life, and many of them had given up life. The retirement 

age 
Œ  
an
d I think it ma y still be today, still re cognized, when you™re 65, back in 
those days, when I was a youth, that was automatic, 65 y
ou closed the book, no 
more work, you retired, and lived the golden years. I never have found out what 

those golden years are
. 
Q: And you™re age what? Ninety
-
something now?
 
A: Huh? Yeah.
 

Q: How old are you now?
 
A: Ni 
Œ  
ninety
-
two.
 
Q: Amazing. Amazing.
 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
141
 
A: But I never found out what the golden years are. I 
Œ 
I realize in so me other 
people™s minds, it becomes stopping work and just
 
enjoying yourself. You know, 
travel, go see your grandkids, take vacations, things of that nature. Those are the 
golden years. But I saw people in housing, senior housing in 
New Jersey
. They 
were not Jewish, just Jewish based. These were people who had gi
ven up on life. I 
developed a program that would hand 
Œ  
may enable them to re
-
ree ngage with life, 
reinstitute things that they had done earlier in their lives. Some had been great 
cooks, some had worked in the industry, some had been musicians, and all that. But 
now, you™re over 65, so you stop doing all of that, and in the process, you lose the 

essence of life. You still have some years ahead. And so I wrote this program out, 
and my par
-
partner, he and 
Œ  
he had access to people who would fund it
. We got th
e 
funding, developed. That was a non
-
profit corporation. We didn™t charge for the 
services. We went throughout 
New Jersey
, to homes for the aged. T he experience 
was not lectures, I didn™t lecture to them, but there were big charts they had on the 

wall. And
 
each of them would go to their chart, and they would plot out 
Œ  
I would le 
Œ  
give them leading questions, what were you 
Œ 
and they 
Œ  
and 
those questions 
brought out their intere sts in life. What things that they did before. Some of them 

were music ians, they gave that up, some were  great
-
aunts and uncle 
Œ 
whatev 
Œ  
but 
whatever it was that they were interested in life, some were great cooks. Whatever 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
142
 
they did, which they were doing no more. So they plotted that out. And I 
Œ 
I go 
Œ 
guided them through that. A
nd many of them adopted new careers, absolutely 
careers. T he most 
Œ 
probably the most dynamic one in all of them was a Holocaust 
survivor in a home for the elderly in 
Cranford
,
 
New Jersey
. A Holocaust survivor 
was just waste 
Œ 
sitting out her 
Œ  
her closing
 
years. And she was only about 65.
 
Q: Oh wow.
 
A: And she was re
-
rea dy to just 
Œ 
Q: Pack it in.
 
A: That™s it. That was it. She didn™t talk. I don™t think that 
Œ 
I don™t know that 
anybody else there knew that she was a survivor. But that came out. One of the
 
leading questions that I would throw at them 
Œ 

Q: Right.
 

A: 
Œ  
brought it out. This was part of her life experience. She then started to talk 
within 
Œ  
with the group, started to talk about her experiences, which she had never 
disclosed to anyone. Some months after that series of se minars, I got a letter from 

her. She had found a new life. She was speaking, not to Jewish 
Œ 
Jewish 
organizations, the 
YMCA
. Those were people and children who wanted to know 
about this thing, too. They knew there was something like a Holocaust.
 
Q: But what was it, and 
Œ 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
143
 
A: But what was it? They had no idea. And they knew there was a war.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: Course, they got a little exposure to that in school, but what was the Holocaust
? 
And so, she was invited to many places.
 
The place there wa 
Œ 
the Young Man™s 
Christian Association 
[indecipherable]
, and places far a nd wild 
Œ  
wide. And so she 
wrote me this letter.
 
Q: That must have been so gratifying.
 
A: Oh, I mean, those are the kind of things that were so, so gratifying. And 
Œ  
and 
that
™s 
Œ  
that™s the kind of stuff I™ve 
Œ 
I™ve done ever since. Raised a lot of money for 
Jewish philanthropy and all, but 
Œ 
Q: So, I wanted to turn in a little bit different way, but taking from this route of, you 
know, how life changed, and how 
Œ  
what kind of
 
a person it made you, through this 
experience. Did you have conversations with God, while you were in captivity? Did 

you have any before? Did you have any after?
 
A: I don™t know about during captivity. It™s always been my belief that I™m a 
mortal, and I don™t have access to God. But I learned, through reconstructionist 

Judaism, when 
Œ  
when I decided we wanted to go that route, and I took a whole 
group, and we formed a new congregation, I learned that there™s a spark of God 
Œ  
when we are created, a ll of us,
 
all the human being, there™s a spark of God in each 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
144
 
of us. And you can do something one way or another, with that spark. And I™ve 
always looked to that spark. Now, that wasn™t during 
Œ 
during the war, because I 
had not been exposed to reconstructionist Judaism yet, a nd I 
Œ  
I didn™t know about 
that. But I did appeal to some something, beyond mankind. I didn™t know what the 

force was. I didn™t think I had the right to talk directly to God, but I appealed for 

some kind of help, support. And then, as I got to know later on, then I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I reali 
Œ 
but in the hospital, there was a moving force. I could never identify what it was, 
something with
Œ  
inside me, it™s a quality, a character 
Œ 
each person has some kind 
of character within him. It was a character in me, I think it might have been an 
essence of guilt. The fact that I ca me through. Not the fact that I sa c rificed so much
 
with the danger, and the torture of living as I did, and all that, but a feeling of 

maybe guilt, that I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I was blessed. There are a lot of people in life
 
that are going 
through torment in their lives. Ma y not be what I went through, but it may be the 

loss of a fa mily me mber, it may be a 
Œ 
a sickness, that your 
Œ  
your 
Œ  
you™re 
confined to. Whatever it is. But that™s where my leanings ought to go, whatever I 
Œ 
I 
Œ  
I can do that will help other people, you know. It sounds like pie in the sky.
 
Q: No, no, no. I mean, this is very real.
 
A: But it™s re 
Œ 
re 
Œ  
very real. I 
Œ 
one place where I differed with 
Shirley
, my wife 
[indecipherable]
, 
she w
as very social. She did wonderful things for 
Œ  
for the kind 

 
Interview with Robert Max
  
 
July 14, 2015
 
 
 
 
145
 
of organizations,
 
I did, too, but she was very social. I 
Œ 
I™m not that 
Œ 
that kind of a 
person. To me there must be purpose. And I think that was a word that would 
describe most anything. There™s
 
a purpose in life, and I have to find what that 
purpose is, and always fulfill that purpose. I c ouldn™t do it just sitting around a ca 
Œ 

a 
Œ  
and drinking beer with 
Œ  
with the guys at night. That didn™t serve any particular 
purpose. But, sitting at a table, meeting with a group of people, functioning people, 

who were doing good for some organization, an agency, social service agency, or 
any other type, that felt right to me. So, always purpose in life. Your meeting, your 
Œ  
your time . Your time  is worth something. Use it in some good way. Just lounging 
around isn™t going to do anything for anybody else, and in the process, doesn™t do 
anything for you too 
Œ 
either. So there was some se lf
-
redemption that came out of 
it. Some
Œ  
something 
selfish, yeah, I would get something out of it. And I do, and I 
have. When I leave one of those schools, and I see these  kids come up to me and 
talk, and tell me about their grandfathers, and all that, and then I 
Œ 
I get the letters 
from them, and they say, your story was so real, I 
Œ 
I went home and I talked to my 
parents. I™m going to talk about it, just as you said, I will talk about it 
with
 
people, 
as long 
as I can. I

oh, kind of remarks like that, that™s what moves me. Socia l 
context 
just don™t.
 
So that

describe it clinically, why that happened, I couldn™t. A psychologist, psychiatrist 
might, but I™m not sure they could either.
 

Q: Oh, this is why I asked from the spiritual perspective. It is 
Œ 
it is 
Œ 
A: Spiritual yes,
 
preserving Judaism, because I got 
Œ 
even though I™m not 
Œ 
I™m not 
very well informed on it, but from all that I have read, and all that I learned about 

what Judaism stand for, it™s all the  good things in life. And it™s 
Œ 
it™s 
Œ  
it™s dealing 
with mankind, 
and it™s devote

devoting part of your life to mankind. All the

A: I read his book. I read that very book of 
Œ 
of his, and that 
Œ 
that struck me. Just 
fairly recently, this ma ybe a year or so ago. And I said 
Œ 
and I 
Œ 
I wrote, and I 
wanted to put it in the text. And 
Heidi
 
and I went over it. Didn™t 
Œ 
somehow just 
didn™t quite fit in the 
Œ  
in the text. Was a little bit too emotional. But, whatever. But 
that gave me the rational
e
. I said,
 
Frankl
, what he preached, way back then, that™s 
Œ 
that 
Œ  
that™s me. That™s 
Œ 
that™s what I became . So I was a di 
Œ 
a disciple of him 
Œ 
of 
his. Didn™t know him, didn™t know his work.
 
Q: B
ut it spoke to you.
 
A: He spoke. He must have spoken to me, yeah. So 
Œ  
and that 
Œ  
that became my 
Œ 
my remaining life™s work. But helping others find meaning in their life. That™s the 
meaning in my life, is helping others find me aning in their lives. And that™s what he 
Œ  
that was the theme that he 
Œ 
he preached. And the fact that he was a concentration 
camp survivor himself, and went through all that. And his experience, when he saw 

people who gave up, Jews who gave up on life in the camps, others who pulled
 
themselves through, by maintaining that conviction about life. And he, of course, 

was one of them. But oh, that 
Œ 
that experience.
 
Q: It™s pretty powerful.
 
A: That did it.
 
Q: Yeah.

A: I™m glad you remember his name. When 
Œ  
when you get to be 92, that happ
ens, 
face it. It™s on the tip of my tongue 
[indecipherable]
 
just won™t come.
 
Q: Well, I want to say, I™m very grateful to you for speaking with us today, for 
sharing your story with us today, for sharing your thoughts as well, and your 
reflections on it. And I™ll say that, for this part, this will c onclude the formal part of 

our interview with Mr.

letter from your brother.
 
A: Oh.

So, I 
Œ 
I wanted you to be able to read the 
letter that your brother wrote to your parents, on learning of your rescue. So, I pass 
the floor to you, please.
 
A: Okay. It™s dated 
Germany
, April 26, 1945. ﬁDear Mom and Pop, I™m so happy, I 
could cry. Just a few ye 
Œ 
hours ago, I received a letter from European theater of 
operations headquarters, telling me 
that 
Bob 
was okay. Here is the first paragraph 
of the letter: Dear Corporal 
Max
, I™m very happy to report that your brother, 
PFC

Robert R

Max
, 
ASN 
15311529, was liberated by our advancing forces, from a ger 
Œ  
German 
Œ 
from a German prisoner of war camp, on 4 April, 1945, after having 
been previously reported as missing in action on 4 January, 1945. I™d previously 
written to 
Bob
™
s 
company clerk, and his answer was written before the report of 
Bob
™
s
 
liberation was received, at Sixth Armored Division headquarters. So, along 
with the letter from 
ETO 
headquarters, came a letter from Sixth Armored, dated 
eight days earlier, stating that there was no further news of 
Bob
. The letter read, in 
part, 
PFC
 
Max
 
was with his company as they attacked enemy positions, about
 
one 
and a half miles northeast of 
Marvie
,
 
Belgium
, on je 
Œ 
on 4 January, 1945. An 
enormous amount of armored enemy artillery, mortar and small arms fire, was 

encountered, and squads and individuals became separated at time s, because of the 
necessity of seeking protection from this fire. After this e ngagement, 
PFC Max
 
was 
not present. A search was made of the vicinity, but he could neither be found, nor 

accounted for, and up to the present date, there had been no further information on 
your brother. Well, further information came today, and I don™t think I™ve ever 
received anything that made me happier. Captain
 
Budrogy
(ph) informed me th at all 
prisoners of war, for more than 30 days, are returned to the 
United States
. If that is 
so, there is an excellent chance of your seeing him soon. I wish I could, too. If he is 

going to be reassigned, I™d like to get him into my outfit. Better still, I™d like to see

him stay in the
 
States
. I intend asking Captain
 
Budrogy
™
s
(ph) advice tomorrow. 
What can I add to a letter like this?  I™m overjoyed, and can™t think of another thing 
right now. I know how happy you both must be, and I know now that God must 
have heard your prayers. All I can say is that we have a lot to be thankful for. Call 
Diana
 
when you receive this lette r. I™m too excited to write any more tonight. When 
I calm down, I™m going to write 
Bob
 
at Central Postal Directory,

Army, and within few days, I™m going to send you the letters for sa fekeeping. Right 
now I want to enjoy them myself. Write soon, a

.ﬂ
 
Q: Lovely. Thank you very, very much.
 
A: Yeah, that 
Œ 
I can imagine the emotions under which he wrote 
Œ  
wrote this. I
-I-
It 
wasn™t easy, because again, the relationship was that genuine, that he felt this kind 
of deeply, and he, like my parents, thought that I wa 
Œ 
I had been gone. But he kept 
up the search, and eventually 
Œ 
Q: He found out.
 
A: 
Œ  
he found out, mm
-
hm.
 
Q: Thank you. Thank you very much.
 
A: Ah, dear. It
™s
Œ  
it

 Œ  
it™s
Œ  
it™s a privilege to real 
Œ 
to 
Œ  
to do i
t, leave it in some 
other permanent form, and it™ll be recorded in here. I don™t know how long this 
piece of paper will remain, it™s getting pri 
Œ 
pretty thin now.
