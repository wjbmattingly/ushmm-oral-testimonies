Q:   I see.  Tell me --
 
A:   We had pretty good frien

and he was not Jewish.  And when Hitler ca
me, he said, I'm sorry, I cannot see you 
anymore.
 
Q:   That must have been hard.
 
A:   Yes.  And I left any way.
  Hitler came January and I left
 January 5th.  I said I'm not 
going to  stay here, I'm leaving.  And I le
ft and went to France to my relatives.
 

Q:   It's very unusual that in
 -- so Hitler came to power in 19
33.  It's  very unusual that a 
young woman, because, I take it, in 1933 you
 were almost 20 year
s old, would have --
 
A:   18.
 
Q:   18, 19, yeah.
 
A:   Well, I had my French relatives.  No
body had French  relatives.  My gran dmother 
was French, was in Alsace-Lorraine.
 
Q:   But what I want to say is what is 
so unusual in what you are telling me is that 
somebody who was your ag e at that time woul
d have said, I'm leaving.  Mo st people 

didn't  Å’ they didn't like him, but they
 didn't  think he 
was that dangerous.
 
A:   I said I'm not going to stay.  I'm leaving.
 
Q:   And why?  Why did you do that at that mo ment?
 
A:   Because I didn't -- I didn 't like what ha
ppen with Hitler.  Our ma
id protected us, but -
- and I had my French relatives, so --
 
Q:   You had somewhere to go?
 
A:   Sure.  I had -- I didn't -- there are parts of Kindertransport --
 
Q:   That happened mu ch later.
 
A:   It happened later.
 
Q:   Later.  In 1933, that wasn 't happening yet.
 
A:   No, no.  But I did say I'm not going 
to stay.  I go to my
 relatives in France.
 
Q:   What did your parent
s say when you said that?
 
A:   They  didn't like it, but they
 said go, they said have a life.
 
Q:   Was your brother there?
 
A:   And I got French citizen
ship because my  grandmother was in Alsace-Lorraine and I 
got my French citizenship, 
so I went back and forth.
 
Q:   Oh, so from 1933, back and forth?
 
A:   I was a French citizen.
 
Q:   So it wasn't the la
st time you were in Lindau?
 
A:   No, no.
 
Q:   Oh, I see.  So when you left in '33,
 you went to Alsace-Lorraine, back and forth?
 

A:   Back and forth.  And I immigrated, I got
 my Visa in Stuttgart as a German citizen.
 
Q:   And you immigrated to  where, to Alsace-Lorraine?
 
A:   To -- where did I go?  Gosh.
 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Homburg?
 
A:   Homburg, from Homburg to --
 
BY INTERVIEWER:
 
Q:   France?
 
A:   New York.
 
Q:   I see.  To the United States?
 
A:   And to the United States.  My brother 
was a doctor and he say -- I say don't go to  the 
United States because you 
have to work housework 
and I'm not doing anybody's 
housework. And he told  me I don't have to.  
He was working in hospital and he said he 
would find some work at the hospital.
 
Q:   And did he?
 
A:   No, I didn't.  And Hilda came.
 
Q:   Who is Hilda?
 
A:   A girl my  brother met when he was five years old.
 
Q:   Oh, the one where he --
 
A:   And she was married to a very, very
 rich man from Klings
bow (phonetic) and her 
mother came and she said if I w ould take ca
re of her mother.  And I said, what do you 
have to do?  I don't do any hous
ew ork.  She said I don't have
 any housework.  I have a 
maid .
 
Q:   Okay .
 
A:   And we went for three months, I don't 
know if you know, to th
e Grove Park Inn in 
Asheville.
 
Q:   In Carolina?
 
A:   Yeah.
 
Q:   Is that North or South Carolina?
 

A:   It's a v ery fancy hotel.  My daughter co
uld stay last year one day.  And I stayed for 
three months.
 
Q:   Okay.  And you were taking care of this lady?
 
A:   And I went back  
and fo rth to Greensboro.
 
Q:   To Greensboro?
 
A:   Yes.
 
Q:   I see.  So when  was it that you actually
 left Germany for the Un ited States?  What 
year was that?
 
A:   1933, 5th January, 1933.
 
Q:   But you had left for Fr
ance then to 
Alsace-Lorraine?
 
A:   I went to France.
 
Q:   And then after that you 
went back and forth to Germany?
 
A:   Always I went to France.  And ther
e was one day you could 
go to Germany without 
any passport.  And I went.  I went as a Fren
ch citizen, but I immigrated as a German from 
Homburg, you know.
 
Q:   And did you leave Homburg in  1933, as well?
 
A:   No, no.
 
Q:   When  was it that you left Homburg?
 
A:   1938.
 
Q:   So it was five years between go
ing to Fran ce and going back and forth?
 
A:   Yeah.
 
Q:   And then immigrating.  So  you saw a lot during those five years?
 
A:   But I was --

three years and then
 I went to Paris.

A:   Now I forgot.
 
Q:   But at one time, how many languages did you speak?
 
A:   French and German.
 
Q:   And then later you learned English?
 
A:   And of course, English.  But my  cousin
 -- I had a lot of cousin s in France and in  
Paris.  My cousin said I'm not supposed to
 work and I worked at
 the committee.  And 
when some people came from 
Shanghai, I asked them, well,
 what do you want to do?
 
Q:   Tell me, when did your 
brother go to the United States?
 
A:   He came five years before me.
 
Q:   So he came in 1933?
 
A:   Yeah, we had money, our relatives alwa
ys had, when they came and visited, they 
took money along.
 
Q:   I see.
 
A:   And so he studied partly in Germany 
and finished his studies Switzerland because in 
Germany it was acknowledged.
 
Q:   By whom?
 
A:   By the United States.
 
Q:   I see.  By studie
s, you know, the degrees?
 
A:   So he studied in --

A:   In Switzerland and used that money.
 
Q:   What was going on with 
your parents?  Did your father still h ave the tobacco 
company?
 
A:   No.  He had to stop it.
 
Q:   When  did that happen?
 
A:   Pretty much after Hitler came.
 
Q:   So soon after?
 
A:   1933, 1934.
 
Q:   What did he do after that tim
e when  he no longer had his company?
 
A:   We had money.  And since it was last the last boat --
 
Q:   Your parents?
 
A:   -- to the United States.
 
Q:   When was that last boat?  Was it after '3 9 ?
 
A:   '38.
 
Q:   Yeah.  You don't -- you're not sure, t
hough huh?  Was your fa
ther or mother, when 
they were left in Lindau, and you we
re gone and your 
brother was gone Å’
 
A:   They didn't stay in Lind
au.  They couldn't stay there.
 
Q:   What did they do?
 
A:   They went somewhere else, to a cousin
 of my mother.  And 
wh en my  dad -- my  dad 
was in the concentration camp.
 
Q:   Which concen tration camp was he in?
 
A:   In Dachau.
 
Q:   He was in Dachau?
 
A:   He was in Dachau
 but not for too long.
 
Q:   How did that happen?  Di
d he tell you how he ended up there?
 
A:   Somehow, somehow.  An
d wh en he came out of the 
concentration camp , he didn't 
know where my mom was 
because she could not st
ay in Lindau anymore.
 
Q:   So he had been
 arrested from Lindau?
 

A:   He was, yes, but then wh en he got ou
t of th e concentration camp, he didn't know 
where my mother was, you know.
 
Q:   How did he find her?
 
A:   Well, he saw a few cousins and he 
knew where one was and he thought maybe she 
was there.  And she was there.  And then 
I don't know how long it to
ok until they came to 
the United States.
 
Q:   Was he -- did he ever talk abou
t what happened to 
him in the Dachau?
 
A:   No, we never talked about it.  I didn 't.
 
Q:   I have the impression, correct me if 
I'm wrong, th at as you 
were growing up, you 
didn't  see mu ch of your parents; you 
mo stly had interaction with your nanny?
 
A:   That's right.  And that's why when I ca
me to the United States
, I said I was so little 
with my  parents, I go one year.  My br
other was a doctor in Qu eensborough, near 
Albany. So I say I go there.  For on
e year, I stayed with my parents.
 
Q:   Was that the first time you were r
eally close with them in the same area?
 
A:   Yeah.
 
Q:   What was that like becaus
e you were already a grownup lady?
 
A:   I was glad to be with my parents.  
I was with my parents -- I w as 18 when I left.  
And, you know, I just have to 
go because I was in Queensboro
ugh and I said I have to go 
one year, I have to 
go to my parents.
 
Q:   But this must have been when your fath
er had left Dachau.  Did he seem a d ifferent 
person because of that?  Had he been -- di
d he seem like he was older or sicker?
 
A:   I hadn't seen him for so many years, I wouldn't  know.
 
Q:   You wouldn't know.
 
A:   No.  My parents had a very, very, very
 good life.  The minut
e they came to the 
United States, they never had to
 work  and my  mo ther had he
r maid and they lived with 
my  brother.
 
Q:   In Albany, or near; in Troy?
 
A:   Well, it's between Troy and Albany.  He had his office there.
 
Q:   Did he still have something w
ith tobacco businesses, your father?
 
A:   No, no.  He was a doctor.
 

Q:   Your brother, I know, but 
your parents, did your father--
 
A:   He didn't have to work.
 
Q:   He didn't have to work?
 
A:   No.
 
Q:   Okay .
 
A:   No.  My parents did not have to work. 
 On ly thing was he had 
a dog, he brushed him 
and they  had a good life.  They never had to
 work .  And my  brother did it so he made a 
checking account and another account and put 
money into  it, so they never had to ask.
 
Q:   That's very thoughtf
ul.  That's very thoughtfu l.
 
A:   Because they came out of -- they came 
to Seattle when my daughter was born and 
they came and they  never had to  ask for mo ney.
  They  never had to  ask for anything.  So  
they were very fortunate becau
se there were very few people
 who were independent with 
enough money.
 
Q:   That's true.
 
A:   And my  brother always put money in th
e checking account and 
when the account got 
less, he put more in.
 
Q:   That's a good son.
 
A:   There was never any question.
 
Q:   It's more than money.  It 
is also a sign of love and respect.
 
A:   That's right.  And I was, how shall I sa
y it?  My sister-in-law, her mother came from 
Shan ghai and sh e asked, I went to dental school
 and I was dental assistant.  She asked me 
if I would take care of her mo ther because sh
e doesn't speak English, she doesn't -- and so 
forth.  I say, what do I have to do?  I don'
t do housework.  She said I don't have to do 
housework.  So we went to our Palm -- our
 house was in Palm Springs, but it was too 
early to go to Palm Springs.  It was too hot. 
 So we went to Ashe
ville, North Carolina at 
the Grove Park Inn and stayed there fo
r three months at the Grove Park Inn.
 
Q:   So this lady that you were taking
