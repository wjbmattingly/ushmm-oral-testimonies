NICO LE LO NG 
 January 28, 2003 
 
Q: Goodmorning,Nicole. 
 

A: Goodmorning. 

 

Q: Nicole, what was your name  at birth? 

 

A: My name  at birth was Ni
cole Jeanne Celina Denier. 

 

Q: A long name! 

 

A: It™s really Œ my na me , chosen name  from
 my fa mily is Nicole, Jeanne my Catholic 
grandmother, Celina my Jewish grandmother, an
d Denier the name  of the father, which is 
a very pedestrian French name  
and played a lot in my fate. 
 

Q: Uh-huh,and... 

 

A: And because your identity paper carried your
 name . I f I had been name d Levy, my whole 
fate would have been different. Because 
you are constantly asked Œ it seems funny now 
that Americans think it™s such an extraordinar
y thing to have to have an I.D. You had to 
show your I.D. all the time  in 
France to get into buildings an
d so. And there I was: Nicole 
Denier. Nicole, Nicole Horowitz would have
 been much different. And if you are Jew 
those skunks pushed your I.D. Œ not only showed 
juif
, but it was put through. 
 

Q: Eachpage... 

 

A: No, you have a yellow– It was a sort of a card. But the word 
juif
 Œ you could not erase 
it. 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: Or cover it up because it was made w
ith spikes. And it cut through the card and you 
could not hide it. They t
hought of so ma ny ugly things. 
 

Q: What was the date of your birth? 

 

A: January 27, yesterday, 1921. 

 

Q: So, we just mi ssed your birthday. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: [Laughs] So, we can 
wish you happy birthday.

A: Thank you. Happy 82
nd
 birthday. 
 

Q: Yes. Tell us a little bi
t about your, your fa mily. 
 

A: I have two sides of my family. My mothe
r™s side  was the Jewish side. It was a well-
known Jewish fa mily from Avignon. The Jewi
sh popes, popes–?  No, the Jewish Œ yeah, 
in the 11
th
 century, the Jews from Po
rtugal and Spain came to be protected by the Jewi sh 
Pope at Avignon. And all my fa mily come s 
from that region. And they are well-known; 
it™s Crémieux Œ C-R-E-M-I-E-U-X, so that 
there is a village named Crémieux in 
Avignon, and so– 
 

Q: Now, explain why you say this is a Jewish Pope. 

 

A: Because, at the time, the Pope in Avignon pr
otected the Jews. And they came  to live in 
Avignon. And that means that when the Germans asked about the Jews, you had to prove 

that you were a French Jew. And the French 
Jew had to have five 
generations. And five 
generations, you have to go way back to cove
r five generations, but it was easy for my 
mother because she was a Pope Jew. 
 

Q: And your mother™s name? 

 

A: My mother™s name  was Marcelle and then
 she took my father™s name . Crémieux was the 
original name of the family. And she becam
e Denier when she ma rried Pierre Denier. 
 

Q: And her first name  was Marcelle? 
 
A: Marcelle. 

 

Q:  Mar c el l e? 

 

A: M-A-R– 

 

Q: And her last name ?  Maiden name ?  

 

A: Maidenname ?  

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Was Monina. M-O-N-I-N-A. 

 

Q: And your father–? 

 

A: My father was a Catholic. They me t duri
ng the First World War. She was a Œ you know Œ 
bourgeois nurse. And they fell in love and ma
rried. And he was an in
teresting fellow. He 
wasn™t born to be a father. He deserted 
when I was three months. And my fa-– my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474

brother was only, was only 12 months older, so
 he was 14 or 15 mont
hs. He took off and 
went to Arge ntina. And became a great scientis
t. He has a museum name d in his honor in 
Argentina. But he was a real skunk. 
 
Q: So, he never kept in touch with you? 

 

A: Never! Never wrote a letter, never sent a 
penny. But his parents took over. Those are my 
Catholic grandparents. And they were very influential in my 
life, intellectually. 
 

Q: So let me  ask you some t hing, your mo
ther is left with two babies.  
 

A: Andnomoney. 

 

Q: Andnomoney. 

 

A: So, she comes from a powerful
 fa mily with a 
lotof money.  
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: That cousin who ma rried Mendes-France is
 from those other people with castles and 
what would be now millions. And 
they supplied he r with money. 
 

Q: So she did not work? 

 

A: She did work. 

 
Q: She did work, too? 
 

A: She did work. And she lived with her sister. 
Her sister lived with us, if you want, and her 
mother lived with us. So we had a warm 
fa mily. And it was in a neighborhood near the 
Luxembour g, which up to this day I like very mu ch. Which my daughter, when she 

visited it, thought was ridiculously poor. But 
she didn™t realize that 
at the time I thought it 
was a little jewel. My mother had great taste and it was a small apartment but extremely 

sunny and opposite the elementary school where I went. And I had a cozy family– 
 

Q: So you felt secure at the time? 

 

A: Most. And the interesting thing about the Catholic grandpare
nts is that my grandfather 
never allowe d the name  of his son pronounced in front of him the mo me nt  he left us, 

never. He– the mother was more tender-heart
ed and kept in touch. But he never would 
like to see the letters; he was not intere
sted in ever hearing from that ma n. 
 

Q: So, did you think that your mother and her 
mother-in-law spoke about Œ that her mother-
in-law told your mother about what her son was doing?  So she Œ so your mother knew?  

Or do you think not? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474

A: I don™t think– It™s interesti
ng, when Œ much later, when I went into her papers, when she 
died and I went to settle things, I found love letters of Pierre Denier that she had still 
kept. I don™t think his name  wa
s ever me ntioned in the house 
of his parents because they 
felt so shameful, but they certainly took ove
r. They had a house in Brittany, and they 
spent three months of the y
ear. The whole summer they spent in Brittany with the 
grandparents. 
 

Q: So there was no break with th
e gr andparents on the other si de? 

 

A: Oh! 

 

Q: On the contrary, they were very much involved. 

 

A: Oh, very mu ch and intellectually. He Œ my
 grandfather was for his job but extremely 
intellectual.He ma de his money 
by ma king up, what you would call, the 
New York Times
 
crossword puzzle. And then once a year, he would go Œ he never went out; they were 

very sedentary. But once a year he would ge
t dressed, go out and compete, there was a 

competition and that made the money for the rest of the year. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: So his money was made really fr om cro
ssword puzzles. Either  winning the competition Œ 
that was a yearly thing Œ or ma king them up 
in the name  of the guy who signed for them, 
for some thing that would be 
Le Monde
, that was a great newspaper of the day. And that 
meant that he was 
encyclopédique. 
When he died, there was 
a fight over who would get 
his dictionary, because the dicti
onaries were annotated and it 
counted a lot. He trained us, 
he teached us in Latin, in French. He had groups of our little fr iends come  every– once a 

week to study with him and he was great. I m
ean, they were just great. And it was very, 
very modest life. They did not have any hot
 water. They did not have any running water 
except in one faucet in the w
hole house. So you can read those 
breaux
 (ph) that you see 
now, people collect them. But for us it was a ne
cessity of life. You had to heat your water 
and then have them pour it and then you 
had those big bowls and you wash like that. 
 

Q: So the difference between your mother™s family– 

 

A: And the other family. 

 

Q: And the other family wa s 
very different financially. 
 

A: Extraordinary. But from the other side, we 
got some  financial help, but we  saw them for 
the first of January or some thing, but not– 
 

Q: But not on a regular basis? 

 

A: Oh no, it was not at all. Because the caste 
system is such in Fr ance that you live in a 
different part of the 
city, you never, never– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
5 
 
 
 
Q: So explain this caste 
system, as you understand it. 
 

A: Well, you have the working class; we ha
d nothing to do with that. We  were bourgeois 
poor, but we had a ma id. We  always had a ma
id. It was done that way. And she had what 
is now the students™ quarters in the building wh
ere we used to live, because they had the, 
had the view. It was on the sixth floor. All th
at floor was ma i ds. And now it™s all students 
and they all fight– 
 

Q: To get that– 

 

A: –to have the view beca
use it™s over the roofs. 
 
Q: So, there™s a strict ki nd of class system that was in place? 

 

A: Yes. And you were not aware of it; it™s built
 in you. You talk differently. I ma rried a ma n 
who is that way and I mean, he spends his 
time  watching T.V. and they say ﬁwhoﬂ when 
they should say ﬁwhomﬂ , and he says ﬁwhomﬂ aloud. I can hear him from my room 

because he is incensed. It™s built in you, that
 you speak well, but you wear their discard as 

clothes Œ except for shoes; the 
rich never give their shoes. 
You can™t wear other people™s 
shoes. 
 

Q: Uh-huh, but you can wear other people™s– 

 

A: All the rest was discards, all the time . And 
I reme mber the time when I begin to wear my 
own clothes and it was a sensation and 
that was Œ I was in my twenties. 
 

Q: But now you said that your grandparent
s Œ which grandparents had had the house in 
Brittany?  
 

A: The poor ones. 

 

Q: The poor ones? 

 

A: But all their money was put in buying land 
in Brittany. Now, we go back, it™s like having 
a ma nsion to us, an acr
e of land on the sea–  
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: –in Brittany. Because the ma nsion Constant
y (ph) was near Bély (ph). It™s me ntioned 
constantly on the news because of it. 
 

Q: Now your, your mother is obviously young when
 her husband leaves her. Did, did she 
ever divorce him?  
 

A: Oh,yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
6 
 
 
 
Q: She did, but she didn™t rema rry? 

 

A: No, you didn™t in those days, a woman did 
not. And she didn™t take lovers either. She 
really– it destroyed her. 
 

Q: So, she was very much in love with him?  

 

A: I think it was a passion Œ it ma kes me  feel choked. 

 

Q: Yeah,yeah,hmm.  

 

A: It™s interesting because when I got involve
d with an American, and another one of those 
love-at-first-sight and fast-move type. It ra
n in the blood. She was devastated in a way; 
on the other hand, she saw that I was going to
 be happy. And she let me  go and never 
regretted it, and I wrote every 
week and never mi ssed a week. 
And he wrote, too, so they 
had two views of our lives. When we were at 
the University of Chicago, we would write. 
And they also wrote Œ both of them Œ and I st
ill have their letter s,
 wrote every week. So, 
there is a way to keep in touc
h. We  didn™t have phones and so– 
 

Q: Right. So you wrote to the 
grandparents and you wrote to–.? 
 

A: Oh, I have the letters of my grandmother. 
 
Q: Youdo? 

 
A: We didn™t write, but she wrote. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: She died when I was 30. You see, they got 
ma rried much earlier and so they had children 
early. So, I was lucky to have her ‚til I wa
s 30. And I reme mb er in Chicago when they 

told me very carefully– 
 

Q: That she had gone. Tell me  what you reme mber about your mother. Wh at she was like for 
you as a mother? 
 

A: She was a roly-poly. 

 

Q: Which means, what, heavy? 

 

A: She was... We called them the ﬁfattiesﬂ, my 
mot her and aunt. We  were not respectful. We  
were loving, but not respectful. 
Ce sont les petites grosses
 Œ ﬁthe little fattiesﬂ. 
 

Q: And you called her that to her face? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
7 
 
 
A: Oh, sure.  
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: I called her 
mamoun
, also. People call me  
mamo un
 now, too, but they we
re the two ﬁlittle 
fattiesﬂ. They were fat, small, but she didn™t look Jewish at all. I had my nose, I was the 

Jewish one looking, but I had perfect 
papers. It was a queer mixture. 
 

Q: When you Œ you were not baptized?  Or we
re you baptized?  When you were, when you 
were a baby? 
 

A: No, because neither of the grandparents Œ 
although grandmother had been raised in a 
convent and him by monks Œ they were not be
lievers. So, I had a perfectly non-religious 
childhood. When I was Œ when the German occ upation came, the Jewish issue came  to 

the fore. The day the Americans started their war, seventh of December, 1941. Then the 

Germans began to force the French Jews, the Je
ws in France, let™s say, to wear the st ar, 
the yellow star. And the people lined up, but
 I didn™t know my mother was Jewish until 

then. It was never me ntioned; we never went
 to the temple or to the chur ch. It was 
completely 
laïc
– 
 

Q: So until you were twenty, you didn™t, you 
didn™t know there was some  ba ckground of the 
fa mily?  Nobody said– 
 

A: Oh yes, I knew that there was so
me  Jewish background, but it meant nothing. 
 

Q: It meant nothing? Because there was nothing in your life– 
 
A: There was nothing culturally. I had never seen
 a word of Hebrew until I was in my 50s 
practically. And it meant nothing 
to her. And it was strictly
 separation of church and 
state, so it was never me ntioned. In school, 
I never heard anything, any me ntion of even 
Catholicism,  although 90 percent of them ________ Catholic. 
 

Q: Did you celebrate any holidays? 

 

A: Well,Christma s. 

 

Q: Christma s, but as a non-religious holiday. 

 

A: As a non-religious holiday. 
 
Q: But not Easter? 

 

A: Is there, is Œ there was a chocolate. 

 

Q: Chocolate? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
8 
 
 
A: Chocolateeggs. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: That™sall. 

 

Q: So you never attended synagogue
?  You never attended church?   
 

A: Never attended either. Neve
r set foot in a synagogue.  
 

Q: Interesting. 

 

A: And then the Germans came. 

 

Q: Okay let™s talk a little b
it more. Your mother is a ﬁfa
ttieﬂ you say, she™s ﬁroly-polyﬂ . But 
what is her personality like? She™s a wa
rm person? She™s an intelligent person? 
 

A: [Sighs] You have to go bac
k, way back. That would be 19
th
 century. She was from 
Marseilles, from Avignon. She was so prospe
rous that the apartment house where she 
lived in is still there, sta
nding up at an apartment house; 
that means something. It™s a 
beautiful, stone, powerful apartment house. She never Œ she was sad, she was destroyed. 
 

Q: Because of the father leaving– 

 

A: She was destroyed for some  reason. I never 
saw my mother but some what sad. My aunt 
was the joy of our childhood. 
 

Q: Hersister? 

 

A: Yes, she was playful. But I had a brother;
 I had a brother who was only 11 months older. 
We played and played and played. And we
 were happy. We  ma naged to Œ they were 
extremely loving. I found my mother, her sadness 
was kind of frightening, but she was so 
loving that we didn™t– 
 

Q: And what was your aunt™s name  
that lived with you?  Her sister? 

 

A: TanteYvonne. 
 
Q: Tante–? 

 

A: Tante Yvonne. Tante Yvonne Œ Tantine. 

 

Q: Tantine?  

 

A: Tantine. Mamoun and Tantine. And we– 
and she was ma rried to a Monteux. You know 
Pierre Monteux? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
9 
 
 
 
Q: Yes. 

 

A: It was his son or whatever
. So, she ma rried well, and he– 
for... and he left suddenly and 
disappeared from, from all of our lives.  
 

Q: Anotherone? 

 

A: Another one. So, it was r
eally a family of divorce. 
 

Q: Oh, my.  

 

A: It isn™ t built in the genes. 

 

Q: No it™s not [l aughs]. And we
re you close to your brother? 
 

A: We lived in twin beds, in the same  room. 
We  pl ayed together. He resented me  when I 
began to be 10 or 11. Because, that was ma ybe
 genetic, I wa s my size at 10. I grew up 
faster and there was one or two years there th
at he was smaller and he deeply resented 
that. But then later we became friends again. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: When– when I began to be an excellent  
student and go to those highly co mpetitive or al 
exams that the French torture the young wit
h, he came to see me  perfor m,  bringing his 
best friend who is still one of 
our closest friends Œ he lives in France. And so that showed 
me  that he loved me  in a clumsy wa y, but he
 did. And then, he and my husband got along 
very well and we rema ined friends through the re
st of his life and he 
wrote regularly, also 
Œ we corresponded. And when he died you, you 
could see that, you would say that we 
were the closest thing. When he came to Cl
eveland to have his arteries bypassed, he 
asked me to come with him. Which was quite
 a thing to ask because, by that time, I was 
teaching college. I ha d to take the 11 days that it took him to stay in Cleveland. And I 

was friendly with his Œ to, to this day I am fr
iendly with his kids. Now adults, they come  
and visit us and stay with us at the beach. 
We  rent the biggest possible house and all the 
nephews from France come . I™ m very fa mily-inc
lined. I think it™s part
 of the happiness of 
life. 
 

Q: And obviously you had a very close se
t of relationships, even from the– 
 
A: Yes, yes and money had nothing to 
do with it. Which is a pleasure. 
 

Q: Can I assume that you loved school, or not? 

 

A: I adored school and I was recognized, and th
ey had things Œ they had prize at the time, 
you know the 
prix d™excellence
, prize of excellence, and I ma de a point of getting. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
10 
 
 
what I was more pleased with is that they had the 
prix de bonne camaraderie
. The good 
chum of the year and I always got that one.  
 
Q: Really? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: That™s lovely. What a nice idea. 

 

A: I was Œ and I am Œ a good chum and I 
still have friends from childhood. We write 
regularly and, and their children 
are close friend. I have a lette
r, I got a letter yesterday 
from the daughter of my closest fr
iend. She™s extremely close to us. 
 

Q: Was it wonderful to grow up in Paris as a child? 

 

A: Yes, although we had no money, so we di
d not go to– I went once in my life to a 
restaurant, in my life, in
 my childhood, when I was 12. I reme mber it and it was a 
cafeteria. But to this day, I re
me mber it as a day of extraord
inary thing. We Œ things that 
are normal for Americans now were not in exis
tence. It didn™t ma tter. I don™t think my 
friends went to restaurants, either. 
 

Q: And who cooked in the hous
e?  Did your mother cook? 

 

A: We had a maid. 

 

Q: You had a ma id who c ooked? 
 
A: I never entered the 
kitchen until I was 18.  
 

Q: You never entered the kitchen? 

 

A: I reme mber that because it was a se
ntence in my biography, that my husband 
reme mbered. I never entered the kitchen. 
 

Q: Isn™t that  extraordinary?  It
 seems extraordinary, doesn™t it? 
 
A: For an American, but– 

 

Q: So, was she a good cook? 

 

A: In my grandmother, you reme mber, I said my– 

 

Q: Yeah,yeah 

 

A: –was a good cook, yeah. My mother was a good cook and I am a good cook. But I Œ Jew 
Œ that ma y be genetic, or it ma y be whatever, it could be taste. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
11 
 
 
 
Q: So, if you had a ma id who cooked, did your 
grandmother cook in the house, too?  And– 
you™re talking about yo
ur father™s mother? 
 

A: No, no, no, no, no, I™m talking about the one who lived with us. 

 

Q: Okay, so she also went, but 
she went into the kitchen then? 

 

A: Oh she did. Maybe the others did. I just didn™t. 

 

Q: You just didn™t? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Did you have a favorite food as a kid? 

 

A: Uh-uh. 

 

Q: No? 

 

A: It didn™t matter too much. 

 

Q: It didn™t ma tter to you? 

 

A: Nah, I don™t reme mber food. 

 
Q: Despite of the fact that Fran
ce is so known for extraordinary– 
 

A: And I went once to a cafeteria and I t
hought it was a great cele
bration. No, I don™t. 
 

Q: Did you go to museums as a kid?  Or
 were they not there, ma ybe not? 

 

A: I probably did. No, I wasn™t very– I had 
an uncle, my brother– my husband had an 
uncle who was a painter. So, I am in s o me  
of his paintings and I was in some museum. 
And he gave us some  paintings. And some  pa
intings of his are sti
ll in Paris museums. 
 

Q: You don™t mean your husband™s brother? 

 

A: No, I mean my father™s brother– 

 

Q: Brother, is a painter? 

 

A: Yes. And he was a stay-at-home. My gra
ndmother had two children, one who stayed at 
home  and never left the house practically, 
and the other one who took to– went to, to 
Argentina. And they were also only 
18 months apart. Like night and day. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474

Q: And this is to skip time, but did you ever ma
ke contact with your fath
er or did your fa ther 
ever try to ma ke contact–? 
 
A: Ah, that is an interesting thing. Whe n I was 60– 

 

Q: 60? 

 

A: When I was 60, my son in town called me  
one day and said, ﬁI have Jeannetteﬂ Œ my 
grandmother was name d Jeanne, remember?  Œ 
ﬁI have Jeannette on the phone.ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁAnd who on earth is Jeannette?ﬂ At th
at point I was in Œ directing Continuing 
Education for the wome n in the college. And 
I was at my desk, surrounded by secretaries 
and ﬁWho on earth is Jeannette? ﬂ And he sai
d, ﬁYour sister.ﬂ I didn™t know I had a sister. 
And so he put Jeannette on the phone and Jea
nnette was in town. She was researching her 
fa mily. And to this day, we are very close.
 We  went to Argentina; she had the six 
children that I would have loved to have. A
nd when we me t that evening, when she came 
to Wa shington to see us, we went to a restaura
nt  and the children sa
id, ﬁThat we have to 
see, the two sisters.ﬂ I was 60, she was 40. 
We were the same person. We laugh at the 
same  thing, we adore each other. If she lived
 next door, I would talk about my sister as 
the lady in the house here talks about her sister. 
 

Q: So he remarried. 

 

A: We ll, six times. 

 

Q: Sixtimes? 

 
A: Yeah. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. So, he moved around a lot. 

 

A: Moved around a lot. I recently got, got so
me thing, yeah. I mean, he was really a woma n 
chaser. Great charm, great gifts. 
But my sister is quite a thing. 
Yes, I have that half-sister. 
I never see her because– but we sent her 
money at the time when Argentina was in 
trouble. She™s delightful, ma rri
ed, six beautiful children. 
 
Q: Very interesting. Did you 
go to the movies as a kid? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Ah-huh. 

 

A: My grandmother, the one we lived wit
h, loved movies, and at the time  you paid 
according to the quality of the seats. So we we
re poor, so were always sitting in front. But 

every Thursday afternoon, she took us to the movies. 
 

Q: And did you have favorites?  
Did you see American movies? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474

A: You have American mo vies in the 30s in Paris? 

 

Q: I don™t know, they were Œ they were in Poland, but not in Paris? 

 

A: No, no, they were– ma ybe on the Champs Elysées, but not in my neighborhood. But I 
saw the old French movies and some  them 
are excellent. And it was completely– There 
were no rules of age, you know. I mu st have
 seen extraordinary, 
risky things and I 
never– To the innocent, everything is innocent. 
 

Q: That™s true, so every single 
Thursday with your grandmother? 
 

A: Yes, that was the– 

 

Q: So, it was very special. 

 

A: And every Sunday, we went to the Catholic 
grandparents™ and we had a big dinner. It was 
a feast, and they played with us. One funny thi
ng my grandfather had is
 that he played at 
our level. So he played checkers, chess. 
We  played game s. There was a game where you 
throw dice, whatever. 
 

Q: So, in addition to teaching you languages– 

 

A: All, all afternoon we played game s. And 
they were surrounded by great books. They had 
first edition, all the Os
car Wilde in first edition. They 
were collecting first editions. I 
mean, they were not collecting, but they
 bought the books. So, it was a very, very 
bookish, intellectual household, completely full. 
 

Q: We are going to have to stop the tape now. 

 

A: You are getting tired?  [Laughs]  

 

Q: No, no, no, we just have to change
 the tape. I™m not getting– [Laughs] 
 

End of Tape #1

Tape #2 
 
A: Then the war came. 

 

Q: Nicole, when you were growing up were you co
nscious politically of what was going on?  
Wa s there talk in the fa mily or what
 it Œ were you mo
re intellectually– 
 

A: I was conscious and I liked it,
 I liked the political life. I like
d the fact that my grandfather 
would, was– left, as he got older. And we 
were for the worker move me nt, whatever it 
was, not communist but let™s say center-left. 
And we were some what left, more left, I 
mean, don™t forget that there were newspape
rs in that household all the time. So, we 
followed the political life very much so. And 
then it continued and still to this day, I™ m 
very consci ous of political things and– 
 

Q: So, when Hitler takes overin Germany, in January of ™33. 

 

A: Iwas–twelve. 

 

Q: You were twelve? 

 

A: Twelve. The French were blissfully wa
nting to be unaware. Re me mber, there was a 
move me nt to try to appease, to do as if
 nothing was happening. So, we went to send 
people visiting and they came back saying, 
ﬁDon™t worry, don™t wo
rry, it won™t happen.ﬂ 
And we felt insulated, and when it came , it came  only because  the Americans entered the 

war. The Germans invaded France and France completely capitulated and it was 

shame ful and I was very aware of that. But, 
as I me ntion in passing, the French protected 
their thoroughbreds, and so they sent to uno
ccupied France. And I had a scholarship that 
paid not only my mother for, for my upk
eep, it paid for books for me . So, whenever I 
wanted to buy books, the governme nt would pa
y. And during the war they kept feeding 
us money, because of my continui ng to be such a good student .  
 

Q: Okay, let™s go back a little bit. So, so prior to– 

 

A: Unaware. 

 

Q: –the Germans taking– 

 

A: Unaware. 

 

Q: You™re unaware. But when refugees begin to
 come  into France and certainly at first– 
 

A: Not in our milieu. 

 

Q: Not in your milieu?  So you didn™t know this– 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
15 
 
 
A: They didn™t move into that 
neighborhood at all. Not any more than they would move into 
Bethesda. 
 
Q: So you™re not conscious of this?  You™re not feeling this? 

 

A: No, no, no. 

 

Q: So, it™s ™36, it™s ™37, ™38– 

 

A: No, happy in high school and working very har
d. Okay, yes, I began to be aware of them 
in ™40 when France fell. 
 

Q: But what about ™39? 

 

A: ™39, I was, again, I had, I had my vac a tion 
paid by the governme nt in a youth hostel in 
Verdun. And I visited the German
 ba ttlefields and the German
 cemeteries. And I ma de a 
German friend. 
 

Q: Who was a pianist, yes? 

 

A: Yes, and he remained a fr iend until he died, and– 

 

Q: Now this is, you are talking with 
him and visiting these World War I– 
 

A: Yes, and he is a German–delight. And that
, I think, helped me  through life, not ever 
generalizing about Germans because I knew that
 Hans Mattern existed in Kaiserslautern 
and if ma ybe there was one, there was more than one. 
 

Q: And his name is Hans? 

 

A: Hans Mattern. M-A-T-T-E-R-N. 

 

Q: And he was a concert pianist? 

 

A: And he was a concert pianist and I still ha
ve his letters at home. And we corresponded, 
and he came! When Germans invaded and my 
mother started having to wear the star, 
Hans announced that as a German he  was playing for them in the army. He came to visit 

and he came to visit Jews, a German in uniform c o mi ng to visit Jews! And he did, he 

never changed. 
 

Q: So, you are, in 1939, under– 
you™re outside of Paris. 
 

A: Paris. And we were very worried becau
se my mother and aunt were government 
employees and we were worried for them, but– 
 

Q: And what were your mother and your aunt doing? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
16 
 
 
 
A: They were working for the governme nt. 

 

Q: As– Doing what?  As secretaries, or–? 

 

A: No, more than that, but they were not very
 high level. You know, at that time, wome n in 
that milieu di dn™t st udy very hard. So, I don™t thin
k that their jobs were very important at 
all. 
 

Q: Was there worry that the war would turn 
west?  He re, Hitler had gone east and Austria 
was taken and Czechoslovakia and now Poland. 
 

A: We didn™t give it a thought. 

 

Q: You didn™t give it a thought?   

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Nothing?  Was your brother concerned about
 being taken in the army at this point? 

 

A: And my brother turned 20 in 1940. He wa
s born in ™20. And he was a me dical student 
already, extremely good student hims elf. We
 were both on heavy, heavy scholarships. 
Our parents received mo ney every month becau
se we were such good students. And if we 
had not kept our grade up– 
 

Q: You would have lost it. 
 
A: We would have lost the sc
holarship. Which means that my 
mother would have practically 
lost her way of life. So, we were always st
udying hard. And he left
 Paris walking and he 
walked to, to the Pyrenees. At some  point
, the Germans were before him Œ he me t a 
German on a bridge, st opped him and had pity
 on him because he was 20 years and wa s 
wearing a brand new unifor m. And he said, ﬁH
urry up, or else I™ll ma ke you a prisoner.ﬂ 
And then he went all the way to the Pyrenees
 and he stayed in th
e provinces during the 
rest of the wa r years. He never came back Paris during the war years. 
 

Q: Uh-huh, this is obviously before
 the occupation that he left. 
 

A: No, in ™40, they did occupy France. 

 

Q: Right. They come  in, in– 

 

A: ™40, French, French lost in, in 1940, th
e spring. The Germans just ran over them. 

 

Q: But that, was that a shock 
to you?  That, that France was goi
ng to be attacked? I mean 
there must have been some  build up between ™39 and ™40. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
17 
 
 
A: I was studying so hard, you know. Those were
 the studies I don™t even Œ I have good 
students among my grandchildren, I don™t see 
the same  intensity of the– competitive 
study. I was in my books  up to here, and that wa
s, I was specializing in Ancient Greek, so 
I was ______ and that wa s when the Germans invaded France. 
 
Q: So explain some thing to 
me . You we re in high school. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And that™s a little bit di fferent than
 the high school here, you™re a bit older– 
 

A: Way above level. Let™s say that at the tim
e, definitely the graduating class would be 
junior college level here. I ha
ve checked it since, since I wa
s teaching college
 all through 
my adult life here. And so we were really a
dvanced and so during the war years, and we  
talk 21 Œ when I was 21, I was studying for what you would call a ma ster™s. But I was 

studying independently, although I had been Œ bu
t fate was very tied with my grades. 
Because I had been accepted at 
École Normale Supérieure
, which would be like the 
Radcliffe, the chaplain was sensitive to the 
fact that the Germans were working against 
the Jews, and gave me  the baptism c e rtificate 
that saved both my life and the life of my 
mother. So, from then on, I had a baptis
m certificate but I wa s never baptized. 
 

Q: And the baptism certificate was dated when?  Wa y back– 

 

A: Way, way back?  Sure, it was a perfect piece 
given by Œ practically given by a chaplain. It 
was not ma de by him be cause it would have 
been suspicious. He wrote to some body i n 

the Loire Valley, in a little village that  guara
nteed that at age 3, I had been 3 months, I 
had been baptized in that vi
llage. It was new in the chur
ch, it was very complex. And I 
had my baptism certificat e, which was the life of the whole family in the future. 
 

Q: Yet you didn™t ask for this. It was, it was– 

 

A: Thechaplain– 

 

Q: Suggested that this was a good idea. 

 

A: Yes. That it was, it was going to be needed. 

 

Q: Did you feel vulnerable? 

 

A: No, I felt blissfully out of it. Maybe because
 my roly-polies were op
timist and I definitely 
was an optimist Œ it pays in my life to have been an optimist, to this day. 
 

Q: I™m going to ask you a little bit about the 
money that you got because you were such a 
good student. This was like a stipend?   
 

A: It was a real salary. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
18 
 
 
 
Q: It was a real salary? 

 

A: It was a real salary 
that you could live on.  
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yes, I mean they really, to this day, pushed
 for the people that they
 wanted to save. And 
there were laws that they created to protect people like me
 Œ were created with Petain, 
you see, Petain and Laval, was where those 
people protected thei
r people. They, they 
sacrificed in a dishea
rtening way. At that point, I bega
n to be disheartened about it. But 
that would be ™41, ™42. The Petain Law Œ 
Petain took the second half of France, you 
reme mber Vichy and collaborators. And the Vi
chy laws are the laws under which I came , 
protected people like my self. As against the 
Poles, that were refugees, the Polish, the 
Hungarian, the name s that you see in the book yo
u can notice, for years, there is not one 
French name. 
 

Q: If I™m correct, a few days before the occupa
tion of Paris, didn™t 
you take a train to the 
south?  As I understand it, your mother asked 
you to leave?  Do you reme mber this?  There 
were a lot of people leaving. 
 

A: It was– yes, but she was– and the Ge
rmans di dn™t appreciate it, she wa s a devoted 
governme nt employee. She stayed at her job. 
 

Q: So she did not leave? 

 
A: No, she didn™tŠand also she was an optimist 
I don™t think she saw, 
that, that was– In 
fact, to the very end, she was having, ready fo
r the deportation, a li
ttle bag, a small black 
bag with a chamber pot in it. She thought 
it was going to be a working camp. And that– 
she ma y have problem going to the toilet but
 that would be all and that she would 
survive; othe rwise, she would not. When they came to pick us up, she still ha d that. 
 
Q: Why did she ask you to leave? 

 

A: Ah, the children were different. 

 

Q: So, she was worry about you as a child?   

 

A: Yes, as a, she was a very, very worried 
mother. And that train was full of children and 
wome n. The r e wasn™t one single ma n on that trai
n that went to southe
rn France. That was 
in ™39, right?   
 

Q: I don™t, I don™t know. I think it was– 

 

A: Or™40. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
19 
 
 
Q: I think it was ™40 because  Paris fell on June 14
th
 and this was a few days before. 
 
A: Yes, right, right, yes. 

 

Q: So did you have questions?  ﬁWhy a m I leav
ing and you™re not leaving. I have a baptism 
certificate and you™re a Jew?ﬂ 
 

A: No, no, no I was not thinking of
 the Jewish issue at all. 
 

Q: Nothing? 

 

A: No, the Jewish issue di d not come  up until–™40?  

 

Q: Untillater. 

 

A: Until ™40 December ™41. Then you had to regi ster as Jews. 

 

Q: But then why is she asking you to leave, 
do you think?  I know that thousands of people 
are going south. 
 

A: To protect, to protect 
me . I don™t know what against. 
 

Q: From the wa r? 

 

A: Yes. 

 
Q: Do you think, from the war? 
 

A: From the possibility of 
the bomb or whatever happened. 
 

Q: Then you get stuck? 

 

A: Yeah, and I learn that eleven, that™s th
e longest line. Nobody ha
s lined up that long. 
Eleven hours to come  back! 
 

Q: But this is after a couple months?  
You™re away for a couple of months. 
 

A: Yeah,right. 

 

Q: And where are you for these couple of months? 

 

A: I was at the house of a friend. 

 

Q: So, you got off the train?  This, this was 
an intentional place th
at you were staying? 
 

A: Yeah, in Limoges. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
20 
 
 
 
Q: InLimoges? 

 

A: Central Fr ance, God forsaken city, and I st
ayed there for a mo nth 
or two and then lined 
up for eleven hours in order to 
get a ticket back to Paris. 
 

Q: So, then, okay, so now, why do you go back? 

 

A: Because my mother was there. 

 

Q: And did she say to you that it™s okay?  You 
were writing to each other, and she said, she 
said that it was okay to come  a
nd you said ﬁthat™s enough alreadyﬂ. 
 

A: Iforgot– 

 

Q: Youforgot. 

 

A: I reme mber the line up, I reme mber the train. 

 

Q: Do you remember Ger man soldiers?   

 

A: I reme mber the first German soldier. My 
aunt was the funny roly-poly, so saw the first 
German sol dier. And she came back to 
the house to say Œ some body saw a German 
soldier and said, ﬁI have seen a German sold
ier.ﬂ And my aunt said, ﬁIt must be English, 
it must be British.ﬂ She never understood th
e war; she never understood what was going 
on. But it wa s a blessing. I reme mbe r  the fi
rst one I saw. And 
they said– You know 
what they did?  They sent smashingly good-looki
ng soldiers for the first wave. Boy, were 

they handsome, and they behaved perfec
tly. The French, you know, touched you, the 
Americans pl ayed around. The Germansnever touched a woma n. They were 

impeccable–bastards. Impeccable. Never, never.
 They would have been killed if they 
had done anything wrong in their behavior
. Perfectly handsome, a wful bastards. 
 

Q: And do you reme mber seeing a German in Li moges or do you reme mbe r  in Paris when 
you came ba ck? 
 

A: Oh, no, no, no. It was in Paris. 

 

Q: Was it shocking to come  back to Paris occupied?   

 

A: It was a pleasure to see my mother again. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: You know, the occupation, I took– You 
took– When– There was a funny rule: you 
didn™t look at them. Wha t  arms do you have
 when you have no arms , while you are good-

looking, 21-year-old, and you never, never looked at the German in the face. That™s the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
21 
 
 
way. You look at their belly button where they
 have the sign sayi
ng ﬁGod Meet Usﬂ (ph). 
That™s what you look at. You never laugh, you ne
ver– but you never even look at them. 
They do not exist. So, that was the game . 
I mean there were ma ny ga me s  that were 
played like that. I never looked one in th
e eye, I saw, I saw they were there. 
 
Q: And that was as a way of – 

 

A: Ofresistance. 

 

Q: Ofresistance? 

 

A: It must have been– disheartening. There were
 ma ny things that must have disheartening. 
You can dishearten somebody just by being ve
ry passive, ﬁYou don™t 
exist, I see through 
you.ﬂ 
 

Q: Were you afraid? 

 

A: I was not. 

 

Q: No? 

 

A: No. We  believed– they never, never were 
brutal or friendly or 
anything. Don™t forget, 
that was their rules. Impeccable.  
 

Q: Do you think this was true all over? 

 
A: Paris. 
 

Q: InParis? 

 

A: And, as a typical Fr ench– Excep
t for Paris, there is no French. 
 

Q: [Laughs] You think that. 

 

A: Yes, to this day, I still feel that  way. Ther
e is a culture Œ You asked me  if I went to the 
theater. I went to the premiere because, for 
the premiere, I had free ticke ts. So, if there 
was a play in Paris, I was at the premiere, the perfect orchestra seats. That was really 

perfect. 
 

Q: Can you explain what the premiere is? 

 

A: The first show. 

 

Q: The first show? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
22 
 
 
A: Yeah, when, the show opens, at the opening 
hours. I had some tickets. So we had only the 
journalists and some , some  people ha
d those tickets in the best seat . 
 
Q: Did you understand how privileged you were? 

 

A: I was proud, I was proud. I was working terribl
y hard for it. I reme mber then, I reme mber 
being told you had only one room that you coul
d barely heat. So that was the dining room 
for the French. They had no kitchen practica
lly and that was the ma id. The dining room 
and the dining room table was where you wo
rked, so I reme mber working with my 
brother at the dining room tabl
e. We  never, never, never stopped before mi dnight. Never. 
We were– and we never interrupt ed each othe
r, either. He ha d his books and I had my 
books. You know, we were– and 
that was a way of life. 
 

Q: And did you discuss your work with your mother? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: No, no, that wasn™t what it was, 
but you did with your
 grandfather?  
 

A: Yes, but that was earlier. Oh yes, he, he tr
ained us. He, he would, he
 would give us little 
things to translate. Yes, yes. 
 

Q: So, when the occupation begins, you™re 
going to school and you rema in in school. You, 
you, your life does not radically change until later. 
 

A: Until ™41, the Americans entered the war. We
 we re plenty in, in anticipation of Œ we 
knew they were going to be the saviors. But it 
started elsewhere, but it didn™t ma tter. The 
7
th
 of December, 1941, you did enter to the war.
 And you we re to come  eventually. Much 
later, but you did eventually come , and at 
that point, the Germans pounc ed on the Jews. 

And requested the star. They requested that 
you register if you were
 a Jew, and that you 
wear a star. And that is 
where the lined up at the 
mairie
, where I was later to be ma rried. 
You lined up as a Jew and that™s where 
the Dashund (ph), who was a big philosopher, 
already in Switzerland co mpletely safe, came 
bac k to register as a Jew. People were 
proud to be Jewish and didn™t realize what it 
was going to entail. You just didn™t deny the 
fact that you were Jewish, ﬁDa mn it, yes I am!ﬂ 
 

Q: But now you had a baptism certificate. 

 

A: No, I went with my mother 
to line up, my mother lined up. 
 

Q: Yes, I understand that. But you 
didn™t, you were not lining up– 
 

A: I was lining to be with her because I was af
raid what was going to be– I was afraid that 
she mi ght be attacked in the street, who knows?  
I, I, I began to sense danger, but for her, 
not for me . I  was in no way in danger. Although 
I– we always joked that I, I really had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
23 
 
 
the Jewish nose. If the Germans were any more
 intelligent, they should have been after 
me, not after my mother. 
 
Q: And did it seem, I mean, you™ll have to pardon 
me  for, for raising a question like this but, 
your mother is Jewish. 
 

A: Mm-h mm.  

 

Q: So, you, of c ourse, are born of your mother
, even though you have a certificate that says 
you are baptized; nevertheless, your mother 
rema ins a Jewish mother. Is that of no 
significance under the circumstances? 
 

A: I had no idea what being Jewish me a nt. 

 

Q: Right. So, for you it had no– 

 

A: No significance. A sense of danger for he
r, definitely, very, very broad-based, you know. 
Intangible, but ther e. She was– 
and that star was very ugly. 
 

Q: Do you ever say to your mother, ﬁLet me
 try to get you papers; you don™t look Jewishﬂ?  
No, she doesn™t ask? 
 

A: There was little that  was said and intuitiv
ely that I heard others say, ﬁWhy didn™t they 
resist? ﬂ  And you reach a point where you are so
 deep in the hole that you don™t resist. 
Nobody is going to resist. It was, it was an 
enormous wave that was engulfing Europe. 
There was nothing you could do. 
 

Q: [Quietly] What do you see in your head now? 

 

A: Hmm?  

 

Q: What, what are you seeing in your head now? 

 

A: Isee– 

 

Q: I can see that you see some thing. 

 

A: Yeah, I see the lining up. 

 

Q: And that really upset you?   

 

A: Mm-hmm. I  don™t know what I would– Imean, you, you wouldn™t tell them anything 
now because it™s so far away. But I understand 
deeply why they didn™t revolt. It was too 
big to resist.  
 

Q: But you feel the pain 
of seeing that line now. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
24 
 
 
 
A: Oh, yeah. But now I have only Amer ican
 enthusiasm behind me , you know. I am not – 
But– 
 

Q: When people were lining up in, after December ™41. 

 

A: Then they were given, then they were gi
ven a piece of cloth. And it was sadistic Œ you 
had to cut up your own star; you had to sew up 
your own star. It wasn™t
 a star; they didn™t 
give you a star. They give  you a big piece of 
cloth with stars on it. And you cut it up and 
you cut up around the star and you had to carefull
y sew so that it looked only like a star. 
It was sadi sm.  
 

Q: And you could have them put on your– 

 

A: It had to be put on the left
-hand side, outside at all mo me nt
s. If you were in your pajama s 
and going out, it had to be on your pajama s. If
 you were outside on the street, the mo me nt 
you were outside on the street, you had to ha
ve the sign of your Jewish denomination, 

beginning at age six. 
 

Q: And what– I understand that you we re not e
ither feeling Jewish or
 understanding what it 
meant to be Jewish, but you saw Jewish 
people including your mother and your aunt– 
 

A: Mm-h mm.  

 

Q: –yourgrandmother. 

 
A: My grandmother by that time was– She died in ™38.  
 

Q: So, you see Jewish people wearing stars– 

 

A: It doesn™t ma ke me  feel Jewish. 

 

Q: No, but were you angry?  We re you upset?  Di
d you think, ﬁWhat are they, why are they 
doing this to th
ese people?ﬂ 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: No? Wa s your mother agravat--– angry or fearful because  she was wearing a star? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Was she proud of it? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: No. This was just what happened? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
25 
 
 
 
A: It was just  really the reality of the day. Maybe it™s survival  instinct . But she was not 
going to deny it, although it 
meant religiously nothing.  
 

Q: So, some thing in her was–proud? 

 

A: Proud. 

 

Q: Proud, but of what, you™re not sure. 

 

A: No, because they were not sure either, to this day, what is it that it meant by being 
Jewish. According to that, in fact, my gr
anddaughter who lives in McLain (ph) comi ng 
from the women is Jewish.  
 

Q: What do you hear– oh, I think I™m gonna to 
stop. This is the question I™m going to ask 
you as we start with, after we change the ta
pe. Wh at did you start he
aring about what was 
happening on the eastern front? 
 

A: Never. 

 

Q: Never? 

 

A: Never. As I tell you, if my mother had lear
ned that there were extermination camps, she 
would have not kept her little 
chamber pot ready for deportation. 
 

Q: She would have? 
 
A: Not!Wouldnot! 

 

Q: Not. 

 

A: Because it wasn™t– If we had known that we
 were going to be  stripped bare before we 
even hit the train– It was blissful ignoran
ce. Until the end of the war we didn™t know, 

until sa w the news of the liberation of the camp, we did not know about the extent . We  

did not see those cadavers piled on 
top of each other, not until ™45.  
 

Q: Okay we have to change the 
tape now. So, let™s stop the tape?

Tape #3 
 
Q: When your mother lined up, when the, when
 the Jews were lining up, you reme mber this 
as 1941, not 1942?  And is registra
tion– that they were registering the same  ti me  they 
were getting the Jewish star, as far as you reme mb er? 
 
A: Yes. The two actually we nt together. Then 
there was a period of 
time my brotherandI 
were really worried for her and that starte
d when she began wear
ing the star. So, we 
escort her. That™s the time they begi n to 
have laws Œ in the subway there were no cars 

left, as I told you. And you had to take 
the– and the Germans had reserved for 
themselves the fi rst cl ass. So, the one little wa
y, one of the little ways the French resi st ed 

was that nobody went in the firs
t class. And the Jews were fo
rced to go in the last train. 
And so the word was in Paris that everybody had to
 go in the last train. It was a sort of an 
extraordinary joke, because you 
couldn™t get into the Jewish 
trains. And this is where I 
have my little quote about my mother and the French anti-Semite. I escorted her ve ry 

often because  I was afraid for her. So, I was on
ce in the train with her, and we were in the 
last train, and she came in the train, push 
shoving and there was, of course, no sitting 
place free, until a very tall gentleman, very 
distingué
, de Gaulle-type, you know Œ very 
strange to be that
 tall but very 
distingué
. And he got up all his height, bowed to her very 
low and gave her his seat and said to her, 
and I reme mber that was my war quote: ﬁAh, 
Madame , when are we going to be allowed to be 
anti-sémite
 again? ﬂ [Pauses] I love that. 
 

Q: What did you think when he said that? 

 

A: I thought it was true. That™s 
the way they were, when we we
re caught finally after Œ but 
that™s Œ I am going ahead of my
self. When we were caught, the French came  to arrest us. 
Finally, they caught up with me  
and then they came  Œ well, 
it was morning, in the early 
morning hours (ph), I was out and the French, 
the French policeman ca me to our arrest, 
not the Germans. The French were doing the dirty work.  
 

Q: But when you went– when this ma n said this– 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: So, the French are going into the last car not because they care about the Jews, but 
because they hate the Germans. 
 

A: Probably. 

 

Q: So, it wasn™t to necessa rily help the Je ws at all. 

 

A: It was not allowed to them, me ntally, mora
lly, patriotically. It is
 not the mome nt where 
they can even contemplate being anti-Semitic
, because the Germans are anti-Semitic. It 
had nothing to do with the Jews, probably. It
 hadn™t much to do with my mother; she 
laughed, and took the seat. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
27 
 
 
Q: She laughed at them? 
 
A: Yeah, she had a sense ofhumor. And she took his seat. 
 

Q: Were you anti-Semitic, do you think, in some  way? 

 

A: I™ve been accused of it by an American fr
iend Œ that was muc h, much later. I don™t think 
so. If, by helping people, you feel superior, th
en ma ybe that was certainly the case. But I 
c e r ta i n l y  di dn™ t  fe e l  s u per i or  t o  my mot h e r . 
 

Q: I didn™t, I didn™t mean that as disrespectfu
l. I meant that, given what you said about the 
French, and you were brought up in
 France as a secular person. 
 

A: No, oh no, oh no, no. 

 

Q: So, you would not have identifie
d with what this guy was saying? 
 

A: Oh, no, no, no, no. No, but I knew that ﬁSo be itﬂ
, that™s the way, at th
at point, the French 
were and you better take it. But it wa
s putting it into words Œ and beautifully. 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: But it wasn™t allowed them. I mean, the Frenc
h, as I said, when they
 finally caught us and 
then let us go, again, becaus
e of my baptism certificate– The French were overwhelmed 
with what they were doing with us at that
 point. They were even in Paris, and the 
beginning of the deportation wa
s already terribly ugly.  
 

Q: But let™s stick with ™41 for a mo me nt . 

 

A: Yes, yes. Mm-hmm. 

 

Q: ™41, you– you rema in living with your mother during ™41? 

 

A: Mm-h mm.  

 

Q: And your aunt? 

 

A: Mm-h mm.  

 

Q: And your brother, or he...? 

 

A: No, my mother– My brother was marrie
d, ma rried very early and move d into an 
apartment. He married a Catholic and so he was completely out of any problem because 

he was out of the circuit, you see. They couldn™t trace him.  
 

Q: Really, why couldn™t they
 trace him?  Didn™t they–? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
28 
 
 
 
A: Well, Germans were both extremely organized and completely disorganized. They were 
concentrating, but they were sort of singl
e-mi nded, you know, they had their eye on this 
one. They weren™t going to go to some body el
se in the family who was ma rried to 
some body from a long line of Catholic. That
 would be too complicated, no, please. 
 

Q: But he was in Paris.  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And he was studying– 
 
A: And practically every da y he came to see if 
we were still alive. There wa s a mi xture of 
realism, wor r y and comp letely aberrant beha
vior. Everyday he came to see if they were 
still around, rather than tell them to move out
. But that™s the way it is. You asked me  how 
it was and that™s the way it is. 
 

Q: Did you have a phone? 

 

A: Nah. 

 

Q: No phone?  So if you– 

 

A: Ah, wait a mi nute we were Œ no, no, I don™t 
Œ I reme mber, I reme mber when the phone 
was installed. I see myself in front of the 
phone, but I can™t pl ace it, but it– I spent my 
youth without a phone definitely. 
 

Q: But it must have been some what dangerous 
for your brother to be comi ng to find out if 
you were there? 
 

A: Yes, that™s what I said. But it was aberrant . 

 

Q: So, you™re both– you™re living at the same – 
almost side by side
 with at least two 
emotions. One is you™re worried about what 
will happen to your mother and your aunt. 
 

A: Yeah, but it didn™t ta
kemuch of my life. 
 

Q: But it didn™t take much of your life? 

 

A: No, completely oblivious and they we re, to
o! I think completely unknowing of the extent 
of the horror of the camp. _______. Put that in a bi g box because that was what kept us 

going was the fact that we didn™
t real ize the extent of it. 
 

Q: Do you hear rumors? 

 

A: There were no rumors in Paris. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
29 
 
 
 
Q: Noru mors– 

 

A: No ru mors in Paris. My mother was working 
with the Jews with the U.G.I.F. Œ that™s the 
French association of the Jews. She had a frie
nd that was with her when she lost her job 
with the government because they were Jewish, at the same time her job went. So, she 

bumped into the Jews and worked with them
. And then that™s the way she got the dates 
when the Germans were going to take, to take the kids. It was the Jews who gave the 

information. 
 

Q: So she, she lost her job because there are 
now rules against Jews holding certain kinds of 
jobs, right? 
 
A: No, the Jews were bounced out of all admi nistrative jobs. 

 

Q: In the, in the governme nt? 

 

A: In the governme nt, th
at™s it, lost her job. 
 

Q: Yeah. Okay. So then she gets this other job– 

 

A: So, she gets the job working w
ith a Jewish agency in Paris. 
 

Q: And what are you doing besides sc
hool?  Are you, do you get involved– 
 

A: Dating. 
 
Q: You™re dating?  You started dating young? 

 

A: I was, it was–very 
chaste
, but very liberating. They we
re, don™t forget also– I don™t 
know if I was already dating because there were
 no me n. They were either prisoners or 
they were in hiding or they 
were in the Resistance  in th
e fields some wher e outside of 
Paris. I wasn™t going to– Who was  ther
e, who was there to
 date?  Anybody, anybody 
between the age of 20 and 25, there was none liv
ing or they were sick. Pr isoners, killed, 
sick, Germans prisoners of war, or else 
there was nobody. I mean, there was a few, but 
very few. Of course, I dated, but at the Sor
bonne, mildly. But that™s the other part of the 
Resistance I got involved in. 
 

Q: At the Sorbonne? 

 

A: At the Sorbonne, that was delivery arms . It
 had nothing to do with 
the children of the 
Jews. 
 

Q: So did, did you do that firs
t, or at the same time? At– 
 

A: It was the same  ti me –a pproxima tely. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
30 
 
 
 
Q: Two different groups for whom you were working? 

 

A: The– The Resistance, it was extremely– First, it was very roma ntic Œ the only thing 
you knew, you had some body that hired you, and you depended on some body above you. 

And you only knew Œ you only knew of that pers
on was that the name  he went by was 
not his name . I was Michelle during the 
Resistance. Nobody knew where I lived, who I 
was. You met in subways. You had to know 
nothing because of the torture. You had no 
information to give. I had no idea who the guy wa
s; it was very, very seclusive (ph). I had 
no idea wher e he lived; I have not seen him ever. But he gave me orders and I filled out 

the orders. 
 

Q: But how did it start?  I mean, you were going to school– 

 

A: I me t a guy at the Sorbonne. He was also 
a student. He was slightly older and he was 
involved. And I had a teacher, a history teacher, 
who was later, much later, the witness at 
my wedding. He was teaching at what would be
 the Radcliffe of the time and he was a 
big– He was a mi n– He was in the Cabinet, in
 fact. Minister– he 
was the Secretary or 
the Minister of Infor mation, or whatever. A
nd his son put me  in touch with that guy and 
that guy would give me  the orders. But he
 knew nothing about me  and I know nothing to 
this day about him either. 
 

Q: But he must have known enough to trust you. 

 

A: Because he knew where I came from. In ot her words, that teacher and his son had 
recommended me  as some body solid. And there 
was also an element of that you had to, 
to risk. 
 

Q: And were you at all hesitant when you were approached– 

 

A: Oh, I loved it. 

 

Q: You loved it? 

 

A: Oh, it was funny. 

 

Q: Why?  

 

A: Wasn™t it? I mean 
carrying, carrying arms. 
 

Q: And how, how would you do that, undern
eath your skirt?  Or in a bag? 
 

A: In a bag. 

 

Q: In a bag?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
31 
 
 
A: It wasn™t– You know, at that
 time , they were not huge th
ings; they were just little 
pistols. 
 
Q: And so, where would you get the pistols, in
 the subway or some thing?  Did some one pass 
you one? 
 

A: Well, most of the meetings were in th
e subway, because everybody was in the subway. 
To this day, they are still in the subway. 
 

Q: So, how would you know?  You™re
 told to go to the subway. 

 

A: Oh, you had to wear clothes Œ You had to w
ear your, your right-hand 
label is going to be 
this way or you are going to wear Œ a fl
ower, of course, or some  sign, by which you 
would be recognized. And the only thing you 
knew, that you would meet that person 
once and never again. And his name  was not his name , and if you fell in love with him, 

too bad for you, because you were never going to
 have an appointme nt with that one 
again. Very, very stimulating.  
 

Q: So, you would meet this person, usually a boy, a ma n. 

 

A: Always a boy. 

 

Q: Always a boy. 

 

A: Oh, I know, one thing, also. Very French, 
and very– some thing that the Germans ne ver 
understood: You would meet a boy and you knew 
that he was simpatico because he was 
involved the same  cause as you were Œ and 
if the Germans we re around, then you would 
huddle. 
 

Q: As if you were kissing, as if you were lovers? 

 

A: That™s right, in a corner of the 
porte-cochère
, and the ma n always protecting you. The 
ma n always with his broad back, so that if 
anything happened he was going to be hurt and 
you were not going to be hurt. It was just de
lightful. And never again. Once or twice, I 
would have given some thing to meet thos
e guys again. But never again, it was never 
twice the same. 
 

Q: So, these were very passionate mo me nts and very exciting? 

 

A: They, they were exciting mo
me nts and they didn™t last. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: But to this da y, I reme mber them. 

 

Q: So explain– I see th
at Œ that you reme mber. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
32 
 
 
 
A: Mm-h mm.  

 

Q: Explain why you were boy and girl 
together. And who would be carrying– 
 

A: Because then, then it was less, less da nge
rous. Then, the Germans were fooled. They 
really thought they were w
itnessing a love affair. And w
ho would dare interrupt a boy 
and a girl, twenty-one or -two, kissing in 
the corner of a door?  Not a German, no, the y 
were too well behaved, no, no, no. 
 

Q: And who would carry the bag with
 the arms in it?  Would you, a girl? 
 

A: Well, at that– probably, at that
 point, I had passed it on–to the ma n. 
 

Q: And how long would you be walking? 

 

A: Oh– 

 

Q: Do you think–a half hour or an hour or what? 

 

A: Yeah, one hour. All through Paris– not quite 
all through Paris. We  
really stayed around 
the Latin Quarter. I was very much a student, my group was. 
 

Q: And would he then
 leave you, or you™d–? 
 

A: Yeah,forever. 
 
Q: He would take it? 

 

A: He would take it and then that was it–ne
ver see him again. And the next day, I would 
get an order to meet somebody el
se, elsewhere in Paris, and– 
 

Q: And do it again. 

 

A: And do it again. Mm-hmm. But that was nothi
ng; that had nothing to do with the Jews. 

 

Q: I under-– that this was ju
st fighting the Germans. Do you, do you know the name  of t he, 
of the group with whic
h you were associated? 
 

A: Mm- mm.N o. 

 

Q: No, there was no, no knowledge of them. 

 

A: The less, the less you knew, the better off 
you all were. That™s the sort of thing you go by. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
33 
 
 
Q: If you can, explain this to 
me again, because I am a little
 bewildered about some thing. 
You go into the subways; you meet some body who has– 
 
A: You had an appointme nt; you had an appoi
ntme nt that– oh, and you never are ahead of 
time more than five mi nutes, never, never.
 Never late, but never ahead of time . You 
arrive promptly, you really Œ time  was of th
e essence Œ you arrive at a certain time and 
you do your job and you disappear an
d disperse, take another di
rection in the subway or 
whatever. 
 

Q: And you don™t want anybody loit-– loiter
ing. It looks suspicious, I suppose. 
 

A: You don™t want to be too i
nvolved too long. In other words,
 the faster that can go, the 
better. 
 

Q: But here, here™s where my question is, 
‚cause I™m not understanding some thing. When 
you meet this guy, does he have the gun? 
 

A: Mm-h mm.  

 

Q: So, you were just– 

 

A: No, I have the gun. 

 

Q: Oh, you have the gun. 

 

A: Usually, I am bringing the arms to– 
 
Q: Tohim?  

 

A: To the other. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. Okay. So where then do you get the gun from then? 

 

A: Somebody– 

 

Q: Somebody has given it– 

 

A: –or else at another pl ace which I don™
t know. The man I don™t know, and I will never 
see him again, the same thing. And it goes a 
chain of command, and it goes way up and I 
have no idea where it goes past
 a certain level Œ the guy I got
 my orders from. And even 
that guy, I don™t know who he
 is or who he was. 
 

Q: The guy who™s name  wa s Jacques, you don™t know? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
34 
 
 
A: Jacques or Pi erre or Ro
bert. And he knows he™s going to
 meet some body called Michelle 
and that was who I was at that time and we 
would never see each othe
r, each other again. 
And you we re not supposed to try to see each 
ot her again. [Pauses] We made it romantic. 
 
Q: It™s roma ntic, but lonely. 

 

A: Oh, it was lonely in a way, but I was 
studying hard so that I wasn™t lonely. 
 

Q: Did your mo ther know you were doing this? 

 

A: No. Ah, no! Ah, no! I know because she woul
d have been endangered and that™s the one 
thing I wanted to avoid. A
nd also she was a babbler. 
 

Q: So you couldn™t trust her? 

 

A: No, oh no, no. 

 

Q: Did you tell anybody?  Di d you 
have any close friends that you said some thing to? 
 

A: I don™t think so. 

 

Q: I™m assumi ng you had close friends at this time.  

 

A: [pauses] ™41, ™42– I mo ved out of my moth
er™s pl ace because I was endangering her. So, 
I took lodging at the student–
 it™s still there–. on Boul
evard St-Michel there was a 
student house. And I had, I had some  friends that I had from t he competitive years, you 
know. Student friends, who knew nothing about
 my activities. No, it was– I mean, 
really, if you call that lonel
y, that part was the silence. 
 
Q: And it™s quite possible that people that you 
knew, with whom you were friends, were also 
doing it, but nobody was talking, b
ecause you weren™t supposed to. 
 

A: Yes, I don™t know that– But ma ybe they
 were. Maybe they were. But we never 
discussed it afterwards. That was not someth
ing Œ but fun Œ it™s done
, it™s disappeared, 
you don™t write about it, you forget about it. Wh
en I go to sleep, we were talking about 
thinking of– I think of all the time s in Brit
tany in childhood. I don™t 
think of those years 
at all. I never think of those years. Probably because they were so fleeting, the whole 

thing had to be fleeting in 
order to be safe for everybody. 
 

Q: Why do you say that you were endangeri
ng your mother?  Since she was Jewish and you 
had a baptism certificate and you were not su
spected of being Jewish. Because of your 
activities? 
 

A: Mm-hmm. I f I had been caught– that w
ould have endan-– Because I was not hiding 
who I was, and therefore, she as a Jew would 
be endangered in another, at another level. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
35 
 
 
Q: So, how did you explain to her why you left? 
 

A: That™s why I didn™t live with her. 

 

Q: I know, but why did you, how did you e
xplain to her why you were leaving? 

 

A: Because I wa nted my independe
nce; that™s why I had moved out. 
 

Q: And did you live nearby? 

 

A: Mm-hmm. Practically next door. 

 

Q: But in a, but in another building? 

 

A: In another building. 

 

Q: So, you saw your mother still very often? 

 

A: I must have, yeah. We  were very close, we were very close. 

 

Q: Do you think she suspected you were doing so
mething, or she believed you that you were 
being independent, to be living–? 
 

A: No, I don™t think she was involved in my behavior. She thought I wanted to be 
independent. 
 
Q: And were you working at this time ?  You had fi nished school, in ™41, or not, or were you 
working?  
 
A: I was on that scholarship and then ag
ain through school, I got a plum job, which 
consisted [laughs] of teaching, but teaching 
people like, for instance, Domi nique de 
Villepi n, the present Mini ster of Foreign A
ffairs, had a father, whom I taught. Teaching 
people from great families who were
– failing. You know, they have that 
baccalauréat
, 
which is difficult. And so it was three or 
four hours in the morning, during which we 
would tutor them 15 mi nutes at time, and s
ee them all day long, always the same  guy, 

teaching him everything for strictly that 
exam. And we had a practically 90 percent 
success level. And that was very mu ch fun, 
it was intensive teachi
ng. I guess it– I never 
heard of it here too much. But over there, I 
think that school had some  others created 
after it, same intense Œ intensive teaching. 
 

Q: Was this a governme nt job? 

 

A: No. And extremely well paid, oh boy!  

 

Q: Really? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
36 
 
 
A: A fortune, they paid you a fortune. But thos
e were the, the, their parent s were in the 
Cabinet. They were the nerds™
 children Œ the guy at the sc
hool called them ﬁChildren of 
Degeneratesﬂ, degenerates, chil
dren of degenerates and they
 were the cabi net me mbers™ 
children, I mean, they were all– 
 
Q: [Laughs] Children of degenerates? 

 

A: Yes, that™s the way we greeted them in the mornings. We  were rough. 

 

Q: [Laughing] Did you give, did you give 
some  of your salary to your mother? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: She didn™t need it? 

 

A: Or I was egotistical, I don™t reme mber a
ny passing. Later on, I w
ould help her in life, 
when I, after I was ma rried. But, at that
 time  I think that I was well-dressed, and... 
 

Q: So, did you, did you– 

 

A: And I paid– You know, it™s far away, but I must 
have paid to stay at that student house. 
 

Q: You had to spend some  of it– 

 

A: Mm-h mm.  

 
Q: Do you remember about how much it was? 
 

A: No, but it was royal. 

 

Q: So, you were now rolling in money in a wa
y you hadn™t before?  Is 
that true?  I mean, you 
had– 
 

A: If it– because of the set-up of life in Pa
ris, nothi ng changed. There were no cars to be 
had, there were no– the great luxuries didn™t ex
ist, there were no furs– Yes, I had no– 
I was very slim, so I didn™t even need to
 eat much. What were you going to spend your 
money on, simply clothes?   
 

Q: So, so let™s talk about that 
a little bit. You have to have
 coupons to buy clothes and to buy 
food, to have food. Wa s ther
e, were there rations? 
 

A: That was late. 

 

Q: Or that was later? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
37 
 
 
A: Yes. No, that was, that was then. We  
had coupons for bread, we had coupons for– heh, 
we had coupons for wine, and, and coupons for ci
garettes. I reme mber 
those three things. 
I reme mber the episode because my mother was the most unlikely chain-smoking roly-
poly. She was a chain smoker. And the postman 
did not smoke but he sure liked to drink, 
so she exchanged all her wine for all his cigare
ttes. That was, that episode I reme mber, so 
there were tickets. Also, well I gave my 
tickets away– to young me n I loved, who had 

mothers who were sick, or whatever. I didn™
t, I didn™t have ma ny needs– What can you 
do?  There wa sn™t that much in the wa y of 
luxury to spend on and I had never been born 

or raised in luxury. It meant nothing to me . 
 

Q: Your– your room that you had, was it a room
 with a bathroom and a kitchen? Or did 
you have to share with– 
 

A: No, no, I don™t reme mbe r  that, no. No, it wa
s a student hostel. It™s still there, on 
Boulevard St -Michel, and I think it was a r
oom. And you know, they were not very heavy 

on bathrooms, and definitely no kitchen. 
 

Q: Did you have heat? 

 

A: I guess so. I don™t remember 
being deprived in any way– 
 

Q: Youdon™t? 

 

A: No. Not at that time . Not in those circumstances 

 

Q: Well, we™ve come  very close to the end of
 the tape. So, I think 
we™ll take a break and 
then– 
 

A: Mm-hmm, but we are not talking about the thing that I came here for. 

 

Q: We are getting– 

 

A: We are getting there? 

 

Q: We™re getting there.

Tape #4 
 
Q: Nicole I, I don™t want us to worry about
 whether some thing happened in 1941 or in 1942, 
because I™m not sure anybody™s me mory can 
be clear about when things ha ppened. But 
do you have any recollection of whether, wh
en you were smuggling the guns, that you 
moved out from your mother, or wa
s it– do you think it was later? 
 

A: No, I think I was still livi ng with my mother
 when I did it. Because I used not to come  
back to the house, as I told you, not to come  b
ack to that apartment, not to involve her, 

not to have her know about my activities. A
nd so– And also for the date, I know that 
what really shook me  wa s that Vel d™Hiv– wh
en the word came  out, and it came out, not 
that I saw the inside  of the place, but rumor be
gan circul ating because, as I said it, was so 
close to were everybody lived. And at that 
point, I thought I had to
 do some thing. But I 
just sort of had to do some thing. 
 

Q: More than what you were doing?  ‚Cause you obviously were doing some thing. 

 

A: Yes, but that had nothing to do with ch
ildren and when they began touching children– 

 

Q: Then that bothered you. 

 

A: –which was late, then I had to step in
 and do some thing. Be cause I was in a unique 
position to probably be able to do some thing. 
 

Q: So, how did it happen that you started to 
try to save children, 
once you found out that 
they were going to take children? 
 

A: My mother working with the Jewish organi
zation had Œ thanks agai
n to the organization 
of the German Œ an inkling or knowledge of
 the dates of the sp
ecific raids and the 
addresses of the specific raid
s. And that™s the way I knew wh
ere to go to get the children.  
 

Q: But was– Do you have any idea how, why the Jewish organization knew?  We re they in 
some  sense assisting with the Nazis? 
 

A: Well, when you think of it, they were terribly close to the enemy. It probably was. There 
was a point there where it was unhealthy. But 
for my sake, it was practical. I think after 
the war, there was some  sort of disapproval 
of that sort of knowledge they had and the 
relationship that they ma
ybe shouldn™t have had.  
 

Q: But when your mother– Your moth
er would give you the information– 
 

A: I guess that™s the way I got it. 

 

Q: You think that™s the way it came? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
39 
 
 
A: Because there was no other way I could get 
it. And I know of what transpired after the 
war about the U.G.I.F and how close they were
 with the Germans, because they knew of 
the German work as it took place. 
 
Q: When your mother would give you this in
formation, did she real
ize that you were going 
to do some thing?  I mean, at that point, is
 she knowledgeable?  ‚Cause she™s just not 
giving it to you casually. 
 

A: Probably,probably. 

 

Q: But you don™t– 

 

A: But everything, everything was so–shrug your 
shoulder. You do it and then that™s it. I 
thought it was norma l, in other words, 
I never ma de– until you shook me  up, I never 
thought of it. Definitely norma l behavior. What
 are we going to do?  S
it back and let it be. 
So, I moved and in the same  way, she thought it
 was absolutely norma l that I, being the 
type of person that I was, would feel that 
I had to do some thing. And I was in an unusual 
position that I could do some thing. Because of
 the way the French governme nt was going 
to protect me , one way or the other. 
 

Q: So you felt– 

 

A: Compelled. 

 

Q: [Coughs] I™ m sorry. You felt compe lled to 
do some thing, but you also knew that the 
French governme nt would protect you, which di
dn™t mean that you were totally protected 
because the Germans mi ght do some thing, yes?  
 
A: Well– 

 

Q: There was some  danger. 

 

A: That came, that came Œ for instance, when I 
think of it, the vivid image I have is that 
mome nt on the train in the mi ddle of the 
night when a German soldier opened the 

compart ment door, and I felt at that point, I fe
lt a very deep fear, because if the kid or 
whoever it was that I wa s transporting Œ and 
it was a kid capable of
 talking Œ had given 
out anything to verify that I was not with 
the mother, I was dead Œ I was just as good as 
dead at that point. So, when I went into it,
 I didn™t know the extent of the danger and 
most of the time , probably, I wasn™t discovere
d, so there was no danger. It worked well. 
 

Q: Right. But now you™re doing this in c
onnection with the und
erground group that you– 
 

A: No, it had nothing to do with the arms. 

 

Q: So, it™s a different group. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
40 
 
 
A: Completely different. That had 
to do with the Je wish U.G.I.F. 
 
Q: All of it? 

 

A: The, the taking care, the taking children aw
ay, yes. Because ot herwise I would not know 
where they were to be had, to st
art with, Paris being a big city. 
 

Q: So this was a Jewish underground– 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: –organization that you 
were connected with.  
 

A: It wasn™t really underground. It was the 
Jewish– admi nistration of the Jews, at the 
time–  
 

Q: The U.G.I.F., yeah, but this particular 
action was certainly not some thing that the 
Germans– You were not doing this openly? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And the only people that would have any i
nkling that I was doing it were the Jews, was 
the Jewish organization in Paris. 
 
Q: So your mot her Œ You recall your mo ther 
giving you the name s and addresses of people 
you were going to be taken. And they clearly, th
ey were taking large groups of people at 
once?  Or they were taking a few at a time that they–? 
 
A: They came, they came individually. They would come  to your apartment and ring, and if 
the bell rang at four o™clock in the morn
ing, you knew who it was. And what happened is 
that after the Vel d™Hiv Œ this is when the Vel d™Hi v come  in Œ they would not anymore Œ 

I didn™t see it in the book Œ 
but they would not anymore 
tackle young children. So, the 
Germans we re delighted to have some body take
 them off their hands. Because it created 
such an endless fear of revolt among the French 
that they were afraid that at some  point 
the whole city would rebel agai
nst them. So, in some  ways, I 
was in the mi ddle. It was a 
sort of a 
cloaque
, you know, of ugly things. It was some
 very shady participation there. 
‚Cause it had, at some  point, to ha ve the Ge
rman willingness to give the babies, and that 
happened at the very specific date. ﬁEnough with
 the babies! If there™s one thing that we 
don™t need in Paris, it™s that problem. ﬂ And 
I stepped in and took that problem away from 
their hands.  
 

Q: Was anyone else doing it, do you know? 

 

A: That I would–not that I know of. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
41 
 
 
 
Q: Not that you know of?  

 

A: I never mentioned it and nobody mentioned it 
to me . It was rare– It could have been 
obvious, you know, all those 
people taking a train.  
 

Q: So, let™s talk about the process, you get name s, and you– 

 

A: Addresses. 

 

Q: Addresses. 

 

A: Times, ti mes, time, I guess. 

 

Q: These people did not necessarily expect you. Y
ou™re just, you™re just  as surprising as the 
Germans knocking. For a different reas
on, but you™re a surprise to them. 
 

A: Yes, and there is some  persuading to do, 
because the wome n, as we know from personal 
experience, do not give away their children. 
So I had some  persuading to do to them, 
which was the difficult part. It was in two 
parts: first, ﬁThis 
is it, you are doome dﬂ. 
 

Q: You would tell them that? 

 

A: I don™t know how I did, but I passed on that 
me ssage. ﬁAs far as you are concerned, let it 
be, there is nothing anybody can do. But there™
s some thing that that German soldier is 
going to allow to be done and that can be done: 
that I take that child away, and your child 
is safe.ﬂ And then I would get the child. And 
the same  day, he was in Italy, he or she, I 
r e me mb e r .  
 

Q: Did you usually have one child? 

 

A: One child at a time. 

 

Q: One child at a time.  

 

A: I couldn™t handle– 

 

Q: How long, how long would it–? 

 

A: I think the Je ws Œ the Jewish associa
tion took care of them until the train time. 
 

Q: No, I mean, when you went to some one™s apartment– 

 

A: I got the child. I got– 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
42 
 
 
Q: But how long would it take you to convince 
people usually?  You w
ould sit there for an 
hour, two hours or much less? 
 
A: [Scoffs] No, much less. 

 

Q: You don™t have that muc h time? 

 

A: Much less, the Germans are not going to le
t me. They don™t have the message. I have the 
me ssage from the Germans at large; they don™t.
 So they are brutal. They, they want the 
whole thing finished and also ma ybe they ha
ve some  human feeling 
that the whole thing 
is ugly, so they want it over with. So, I don™
t have much problem w
ith them, I have the 
problems with the woma n. 
 

Q: You don™t have problems with whom?  

 

A: With the Germans. The Germans ha ve been given the me ssage: ﬁNo children, no dealing 
with children under the age of threeﬂ. So, I ha
d no problem with the German at that point. 
I am in a s mall apartment in nowhere 
in Paris, usually a poor neighborhood, not 
especially a Jewish neighborhood 
and confronting a woma n, and 
that™s the woman that is 
the problem or could be the problem. 
 

Q: Is the husband usually there, or not–? 

 

A: No, there were no me n in Paris. 

 

Q: Nome n.  
 
A: He is either a prisoner of war or
 in the Resistance
 or he™s out. 
 

Q: So, these wome n are alone? 

 

A: Women. 

 

Q: So, would it be very ofte
n very quickly that the people would say, ﬁOkay, take the 
childﬂ? 
 

A: Yeah, I think when they saw Germa ns come  
in, they had a feeling 
that– of the ugliness 
of it. Even if they were uncultured and uni nforme d, they would sens
e the enormity of it 

and it wouldn™t be a battle. I don™t reme mber 
a battle. And then you would have to get the 
identity of the child in or
der to after the war to be 
careful to have kept track. 
 

Q: Of who the child was. 

 

A: Of who the child was! And at that point, 
he was in Italy, the ch
ild was in It aly, in a 
convent. And that™s when another 
battle started with the Italians. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
43 
 
 
Q: Were there mothers who refused 
to give you their, their children. 
 
A: Nope. Never did. 

 

Q: All of them Œ all of the mothers got– 

 

A: That™s right. They would– all of the 
mothers would give a chance to the child. 
Imme diately– what happened was that imme di
ately they realized that there was no 
chance for them– with the Germans. There was no chance for them and if they took the 

child with them, I told them in no uncertain
 terms ﬁThat child will not save you. The fact 
that you have  a child even at the br east w
ill not save you.ﬂ And the, the ugliness of the 
German sol diers was such that they felt it. 
And that I came  fr om the, probably, I don™t 
reme mber, but I came probably from the, from the Jewish agency, and that was 

reassuring for them. I had their identity, I ha
d their card, and they trusted it. And then 
they were, were in such a–.state
 that they had to trust some body. 
 

Q: Did you, by this time , understand sort of what
 was happening, that these people would be 
killed? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Soyou– 

 

A: I had a deep understanding. 
It didn™t give me – I was 
21. I thought everybody was dead 
at 25 or should be dead– 
 
Q: Anyway? 
 

A: –anyway. And that it was the time  limit for 
living, and that I was immo rtal, definitely. I 
never felt that ther e was any Œ felt deeply that  I was immortal. 
 

Q: So, did you think these Jews were going to be killed in a camp? 

 

A: Hmm.[nods ] 

 

Q: You did.  

 

A: At that point, I had the feeling, because of the–because of the confrontation between the 
German sol dier and the, and the wome n, I had 
the feeling that it was going to be very 
ugly. 
 

Q: Now, do I understand you that the Ge
rman was there with you some ti mes? 
 

A: They, they were arresting the women. 

 

Q: At the same time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
44 
 
 
 
A: That™s when I came. 

 

Q: You ca me  at the time  that they™re arresting–? 

 

A: That™sright. 

 

Q: Oh, oh, I see– 

 

A: Because otherwise, the ki d would not be left behind in the apartment all by himself. 

 

Q: No, see, I thought that you came prior to 
the Germans, that you would try to beat the 
timing of the Germans. So you™re
 there just  as the German–? 
 

A: I wouldn™t have had a chance. 

 

Q: Because the mothers wouldn™t do it? 

 

A: They wouldn™t do it. But when they see 
Œ saw the Germans come for the family and 
they™re willing to let go of the 
child. Then they realize the da
nger they were in, and they 
were willing to let go of the child. 
 

Q: That™s quite amazing. I didn™
t Œ I had no idea that it was– 
 

A: Well, when you think of it, it™s the only way it ma de sense. 

 
Q: Yeah,yeah. 
 

A: And it was not very difficult because they re
ally banged Œ they didn™
t knock at the door Œ 
they really banged at the door. And they 
looked– very– you would have to have a 
picture them Œ they were Gestapo soldiers; 
they were not regular German soldiers. Or 

they were French policemen. But the whole, 
the whole episode was very dramatic and the 
women felt it. 
 

Q: So, when they knocked at the door or– 

 

A: They banged at the door! 

 

Q: –banged at the door, were you standing with
 them?  Or did you, after they got in, you 
went in with–?  I mean, how– where were you–? 
 

A: I guess I must have been with them. 

 

Q: It™s quite amazing when
 you think about it, no? 
 

A: The whole thing is amazing, that it took place and I– and we survived. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
45 
 
 
 
Q: Was there a lot of screami
ng and crying, with the children–? 
 

A: At other times, at other time
s, when I was taken with my mother, it was, it was another 
thing. When they finally got 
my number and came for me ear
ly morning. At that point, 
there were a lot of hysteri cs. But when it was individual, the mothers were very 

protective of the child and if you have a young 
child, you don™t want to
 be hysterical in 
front of the child, so they kept the face. 
 

Q: But often, the child feel s the terror– 

 

A: They feel it but they freeze.  

 

Q: But they freeze? 

 

A: Which is what saved my life in the train when the Germans came in the compartment was 
that the reaction of fear in 
that child then is going to 
be freezing and not yelling. 
 

Q: But what happened to you when you, you– On
 the one hand, you™re going to probably 
save the child. On the other hand, you know that 
this child™s mother is
 going to be killed 
and that the child will ne
ver see the mother again. 
 

A: It was very 
dichotomique
. Yeah, it di dn™t faze me. 
 

Q: It didn™t faze you? 

 
A: No. 
 

Q: Was that because you were savi
ng some one, or just because you–? 
 

A: I think, you had to be anesth
esized (ph) or you™re not going 
to work for the procedure. 
 

Q: You had to what? 

 

A: To be anesthesized. 

 

Q: Anesthesized. 

 

A: In some  way, if you are very deeply invol
ved in the whole procedure of the Germans, 
you™re not going to do it. You™re going to mi ss it; you had to keep your composure. 
 

Q: So, the mother is taken, you have the child– 

 

A: Then, I give it during the day to the Je wish 
thing because I have to get my train ticket. 
There is a procedure. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
46 
 
 
Q: So you go to the U.G.I.F. andthey keep the children, the child. 
 

A: They keep the children until– 

 

Q: Until you leave?   

 

A: Right, until train time come s. And then I ge
t my ticket, the children were traveling fr ee, 
and then I get my ticket, always in
 the same  direction: Paris-Nice. 
 

Q: Paris-Nice? 

 

A: Paris-Nice, which is the Paris-Méditerranée.
 That™s a very straight train, it is an 
overnight. 
 

Q: An overnight train? 

 

A: It™sanovernight 
train, so it was nice. 
 

Q: Now, were most of the ch
ildren actually babies or–? 
 

A: The ones I took care of 
were all under three. 
 

Q: Were all under three?  But some  of t hem could talk a little bit? 

 

A: Yes. But not in front of Germans, they wouldn™t. 

 
Q: They talked to you? 
 

A: Oh, babbled, yes.  

 

Q: Babbled. 

 

A: But they knew I wasn™t their mother. But they were in pretty bad shape, bad day, you 
know. They had had a bad day. 
 

Q: And did you try to comfort them?  

 

A: Sure, I was– warm and nice,
 but I was only 21. I hadn™t even 
slept with a ma n; I was out 
of it. In the deep sense that I would have 
been when I had my own children in my arms, 

completely different, which probably helped. 
 

Q: YesI– 

 

A: I would have become  hysterical mys e lf otherwise. 

 

Q: So, you™d be on the train, did you–? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
47 
 
 
 
A: Then I took the train and– 

 

Q: Did you have– If there were babies, di
d you have diapers, did you have changing 
clothes?  
 

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes the U.G.I.F. organized– I had, I had the stuff. 

 

Q: Did they teach you how to change diapers? 

 

A: Oh, well. [shrugs] 

 

Q: Or did you know? 

 

A: At the time , you know, it was during war year
s, you did what you could. And they are not 
that keen on cleanliness. But the child was 
safe. And I Œ they had 
Œ they had those long 
banks, which are fairly padded. And I would gi
ve my war mth, in other words, I would 
put the baby on me  so that, you know and I w
ould wrap my arms around, so that the child 
felt protected at the end of a di
fficult day. It was a difficult. I,
 I tried to feel for the baby. 
It must have been very horribl e. But they
 fell asleep and that™s– until they stopped and 
they– 
 

Q: So, then you would get off at Nice, yes? 

 

A: Yes, I had that episode when the Germans came  i n and the child– 

 
Q: Uh-huh. And then what happened? 
 
A: Because one time, the Germans, they were 
patrolling the train. I don™t know what for, but 
for– And at that time, I was frightened. Becau
se my life was really on the line, if the ki d 
gave me away. But I can reme mber, they absolu
tely froze; they never said a word, they 
were just stiff with fear. They reme mbered 
the morning episode, the separation of their 
mother. It wa s the end of a terrible day. So, 
I didn™t have any probl
em with the children, 
and we arrived in Nice finally. And I still re
me mb er, I still reme mber the view of the 
Italians. The Italians were cowards made liv
e and had declared war with France, their 
neighbor, in June ™40 and had moved militarily 
to Nice. That™s all. [Laughs] That™s all 
they could ma nage. And so they occupied fr
om Monaco to Nice, which is 30 kilometers 
of France territory. But for those ki ds it meant life and death because when you saw an 

Italian soldier, you knew that they were not goi ng to kill any babies. So that™s it. And I 

know that they took them to some
 religious institution in Italy. 
 

Q: Now, was this established that the Italians  police Œ oh, not the Italia
n police Œ the soldiers 
would take– 
 

A: No, they were in the train station.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
48 
 
 
Q: They were just there and you just gave it to them?  You just gave it– 
 

A: Yes, yeah, yes. But at that time , the, 
the Jewish organization in Paris must have 
communicated. They had contact near the fr
ontier, and those children were taken to 
convents. And I know that because there was an enormous ruckus between those 

convents and Israel, at the end of the war, b
ecause Israel wanted those Jewish kids to 
come  to Israel. And the Italians wouldn™t give 
them. At that point, 
I thought it was a huge 
joke, I couldn™t care less– what happened, th
ey were alive. Whether they were Israeli 
citizen or Italian citizen or
 no citizen, they were safe. 
 

Q: Now, how did people keep track of whic
h child was, was actually who– you know what 
I mean? –the identity of the child? 
 

A: Well, well I– that would be given to w
hoever was handed the child. I would give the 
pap-whatever written scribbles I ha
d about the identity of the mother. 
 

Q: I see. So, that would go with the 
child and then that would be given– 
 

A: Then that could be their problem. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: I got rid of that 
problem with the child. 
 

Q: So, as far as you knew, these so
ldiers would bring these babies– 
 
A: Oh, as far as I know from documentation, fr
om movies, from everything that has been 
written, there was not one child killed by Italians. 
 
Q: And you would then stay overnight in 
Nice?  Or go right– Or turn around and–? 
 
A: I had a feeling that I had to come  back if 
only so that my mother 
wouldn™t be worried and 
suspicious, and so that I coul
d continue in my studies or whatever I was doing. But that 
was the least of my worries, so
 I don™t really reme mber. I don™
t think I stayed in Nice Œ I 
didn™t have any money. 
 

Q: How long a trip did it take? 

 

A: Hmm?  

 

Q: How long a trip did you have? 

 

A: It™s an overnight.  

 

Q: It™s an overnight, so that 
if you would come  in the morning– 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474

A: Yes, I guess I must Œ mu st have stayed some where. Maybe there was a day train. I have 
no idea of the retu
rn. That was– 
 
Q: But you think that you we re still staying at
 mother™s house, or you were in the other 
place? 
 

A: I had another place and one ni
ght, I was so tired comi ng back 
early, I came to sleep at her 
place and that™s when the Germans got us. So it was a– 
 

Q: You were going back– 

 

A: I was going back and forth. 

 

Q: Did your mo ther ever become  su
spicious?  Ever say anything to you? 
 

A: Well, she must have known there was so
me thing going on. She knew better than to ask. 
 

Q: Do you remember approxima tely how ma ny trips you took? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Five?  Ten?  No?  You have no idea? 

 

A: No, probably not more than ten. I reme mber ju
st a very few of them, and definitely part 
of the job was not to count. 
 
Q: Do you have in your head pictures of some  of these kids? 
 

A: Hmm?  

 

Q: Do you have in your head pictures of so
me  of these kids?  Do you see yourself on the 
train with these babies? 
 

A: Yes, yes, yes, that I do. 
Some  mo me nts are very clear. 

 

Q: Are you crying about this? 

 

A: No, that they were children and they were
 in my lap and they were sleeping and that 
damn door flew opened. 
 

Q: It was pretty scary when the Germans...? 

 

A: Oh, yeah, that was for me, too. But the people in the compartment never knew much 
either. They didn™t like Œ nobody liked to be as
ked by the Germans about their I.D. in the 
mi ddle of the night. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474

Q: So, one night instead of going to
 your little studio apartment– 
 
A: –I went back to sleep in my bed. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And that night, that mor ning, they came . Unmi stakable knock at the door. And they were, 
those were Fr ench policemen, two little French policemen almost may age. 
 

Q: Little ones?  Al most your age? 

 

A: Yes, they were ma ybe 23 to my 21, but very young. And I reme mber them Œ they were 
almost my size and they followed me – to 
where I washed. They watched me  wash, 

supposedly because they were afraid I was going to commit suicide. 
 

Q: So wait, wait, wait a second; th
ey come  to your mother™s house–? 
 

A: They come t o my mother™s house. 

 

Q: Why do they come  Œ for you do you think?  What do they say? 

 

A: To take me  to the Germans.  

 

Q: Take you?  So do you think that they were–? 

 

A: And my  mother. 
 
Q: –trackingyou–? 

 

A: Ohyes. 

 

Q: In terms of your work? 

 

A: I think, I think that they were, yes.
 I think they were tracking me  finally. 
 

Q: So they– Well, some  Germans knew what
 you were doing because you were at the door 
with them. 
 

A: Yes,right. 

 

Q: However, you thought this was okay– 

 

A: Well, as I said, I was blissfully lackadaisi
cal. I– it is a tendency 
I have kept through my 
life. I think it helps with the bumps of life altogether. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
51 
 
 
Q: Now, do you think they were comi ng 
for you and your mother, or you, and they 
happened to pick up your mother at the same  time ?  
 
A: They happened to pick up my mo
ther [laughs] at the same  time. 
 

Q: So all along, it™s your mother
 who you think is in danger– 
 

A: Mm-hmm. And at that point 
mostly– What was lovely at th
at point was that the only 
papers that she carried was my baptism certific
ate. And she let those little soldiers, those 
little policeme n, French policemen follow me  
and see as much of me as possible. She 
didn™t say, ﬁLeave her alone. Don™t go to the 
bathroom with her.ﬂ 
No, she wanted as 
much intimacy between those two little guys and 
her little daughter as possible. And that, 
at the end of the morning, is what saved our lives. 
 

Q: She was smart. 

 

A: Because then we were taken to the Ge rmans.
 Then we were taken to the Ma rais and the 
German scene was very– That™s when the wo
me n were hysterical. 
And there were 52 of 
us, as I reme mber, and they knew that I was goi
ng to get out. And they all gave me  their 
lists of addresses and people 
to notify. And not one of si
ngle one of them came back 
alive. So, what happened is that the scene 
got uglier and uglier and at some  point, as you 

see in movies, you are pushed into a courtyar
d. And in the courtyard, there is a truck and 
the back of the truck flips down and at that
 point, you™re pushed in. And at that mo me nt, 
it was bedlam. The women were hysterical.
 The whole tr-– the whole thing was 
crowded; there were too ma ny people for the 
courtyard. And my mother kept after those 
two little guys Œ and she was much more in 
danger than you can imagine Œ was keeping 
after them saying, ﬁLet her go, she shouldn™t be 
here, let her go!ﬂ And at some  point, they 

said, ﬁThe hell with you, get out of here!ﬂ And at
 that point, I lost all my courage. I began 
to cry and she found all her courage back a
nd she was, that littl
e roly-poly with no 
gumption at all, was smiling and said, ﬁOkay, 
let™s get out.ﬂ And she knew how to get out 
and she knew how to find the café. And she stood
 there at the Jewish 
café, which is still 
there, it™s a Je wish café, and she 
plunked down and she had to have her 
café
, in front of 
all the trucks going by. 
 

Q: We have to stop.

Tape #5 
 
Q: Nicole, I would like to bring you back to 
when these two guys, th
e police Œ the French 
policeman and French detective, am I co
rrect? Or are they two French police? 
 

A: Two French policemen. 

 

Q: Two French policemen, no detective. When they come  in, the bang on the door, were you 
Œ are you actually sleeping yet? 
 

A: Sure. 

 

Q: You are sleeping. 

 

A: It was four or five in the morning. 

 

Q: And– 

 

A: They take you to the subway. 

 

Q: No, but what do they say?  Do they say a
nything?  They™re in the 
house, but not very long. 
They just say– 
 

A: They, they, they–  

 

Q: ﬁComeout.ﬂ 
 
A: The same  thing that they must say around th
e world, ﬁI.D. verificati
on.ﬂ I.D. verification, 
whatever that meant, or whatever. 
 

Q: So, your mo ther has the presence of
 mi nd to take your baptism certificate. 
 

A: Oh, that! She 
was carrying it– 
 

Q: Allthetime? 

 

A: All that mor ning. She practically slept with 
it. Yes, it was very meaningful to her that I 
would survive those expe riences. 
 

Q: So, she has that. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: But they know she is Jewish of course because  she– 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
53 
 
 
A: Yes, she wears the star, 
mm-hmm. It™s five o™clock in the morning and we  go on the 
subway and it™s filled with working class people
. And they don™t like it at all. You could 
feel that they do it very early, but still get 
the lower class, working class people and those 
are the least prejudiced proba
bly. And they don™t like what th
ey are seeing. They, they 
know it™s going to be ugly and they had 
those two wome n surrounded by those two police 
offi cers.  
 

Q: Are you finally frightened at that mo me nt?   

 

A: No. 

 

Q: No, you™re still not frightened? 

 

Q: Takes you, takes you a while. S
o, they bring you to Marais? 
 

A: To the Marais. 

 

Q: TheMarais? 

 

A: To the hotel in front of Flambaum
, which is st ill there. A beautiful 
hôtel  particulier.
 And 
there, they take us to the– There that  th
e Germans are, and then it become s ugly, ugly, I 

mean, they start– My mother puts her hand 
on the table and they whipped her. So, that 
sort of behavior I hadn™t seen before.  
 

Q: And do they ask you questions?  Is
 there an interrogation or not? 

 
A: Well they ask for I.D. and I showed the I.D. 
and so they, they know that it is I and it is 
my mother. And then we went into a waiti
ng room with 50 other people, all wome n and 
children that morning, by the way.  
 
Q: And at this point, do you know
 that they™re going to deport 
you?  Do they say anything?  
They™re going to take you some where? 
 

A: I guess so. There was no other though
t that you could have; that was it. 
 

Q: Do you remember what you were wearing?  Di
d they, did they allow you to change your 
clothes from your pajama s or nightshi
rt or whatever you were wearing? 
 

A: Yes, since they watched me  wash, they watc
hed me  dress! I was wearing the same  thing I 
wore during the whole war years. I spent a lo
t on shoes. As I told you, the rich don™t give 
up their shoes, so the luxury for 
me was to have shoes made to 
mesure
 Œ custom made. 
And no stockings because there were no stocki ngs to be had during the war and, you 

know, I remember the coat, which was very handsome. It was cut up from the beautiful 

coat of a ma n cousin of mi ne, the rich cous
ins. So, I was simply well-dressed, no hat.  
 

Q: They watched you get dressed? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
54 
 
 
 
A: They watched me  get undressed– 

 

Q: Anddressed? 

 

A: Wash– 

 

Q: Anddressed. 

 

A: They went to the bathroom with 
me . So they watched me  wa sh, bare.  
 

A: They sat around the sink with me  while I washed.  

 

Q: Because– 

 

A: They didn™t speak, but they 
were with me . And I came back 
and I snuck to the bathroom 
and that was so small they couldn™t get in. Bu
t they stayed at the 
door of the bathroom. I 
went to the bathroom and I went to my room
 and I got dressed and they were there when 
I got dressed. Then that™s when they got attached.  
 

Q: And that, in part Œ they 
ma y have done it anyway Œ but 
your mother knew that that was 
some how– mi ght, mi ght work that th
ey mi ght get attached if they– 
 

A: I don™t think that– 

 

Q: No? 
 
A: I don™t think it was a conscious thought.  

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: They would have done anyhow. I mean, 
that was part of the–humiliating you. You 
know, it™s hu miliating to have some body watch what you are washing your behind are 

two young people, snickering. They didn™t sn
icker. They didn™t say anything, do 
anything, just watched–but
 they were French. 
 

Q: But they were French. 

 

A: They were in a French uniform. And then 
we went to the subway, in second class, not 
specially in a compart ment. And those were 
French people going to 
work very early in 
the morning. Therefore, those are not the bour
geois; those are the 
working class people. 
And you fee l  that they didn™t like it. 
 
Q: Did they– anybody say anything? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
55 
 
 
A: No! That was dangerous. Those French pe
ople were a– police people are– well, they 
had their 
bâtons
, at least, you know; it was da
ngerous to say anything. 
 
Q: When your mother was hit on the hand once you were in– 

 

A: She just took her hand off. 

 

Q: And that™s all they did?  Th
ey didn™t, they didn™t beat he
r; they simply didn™t want her 
hand on the table, do you think? 
 

A: Just a whip. 

 

Q: Yeah, and it hurt? 

 

A: Probably, she didn™t say anything. 

 

Q: So, you were then put in this room with 
about 50 other people, ma
inly women Œ or all 
wome n and children, no me n. 
 

A: Mm-hmm, it was just wome n and children, no me n at all. 

 

Q: And is there some one in the room guarding you? 

 

A: It™s supposed– There is a room whe r e the 
Germans are. And then there is the other 
room. There is no need; there is nowhere to go. 
 
Q: Because the only exit– 
 

A: Would be through that room, which had their desk. 

 

Q: Anywindows? 

 

A: I think there was, going into the courty
ard. Nobody tried anything. They were kind of, 
you go into a sort of what you would call a stat
e of shock. You are not
 quite at your most 
vivid at that mome nt. 
 

Q: So, people are not talking? 

 

A: People are not talking, but they are passing 
pieces of paper to me  
with their name  and 
addresses to contact. 
 

Q: But that™s only when they knew that you were leaving? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: No, they just did it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
56 
 
 
 
A: From the word go, they knew I had a baptis
m certificate. And my mother was flaunting it 
probably and talking about it. And they knew 
that if one person had a chance of getting 

out, I was the one, and therefore I coul d cont
act, because they had no way of contacting 
their relatives. So, I came out with
 a list of name s and addresses. 
 

Q: [Background person says some thing to intervie
wer] Okay, so we™re now back after that 
little interruption. So– 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: So, people are handing you name s of relatives that you can contact because they think, if 
anybody gets out, it™ll be you. 
 

A: Yeah. And it was. Fifty-two of 
them, not one of them otherwise. 
 

Q: So, all of you go out to the courty
ard, the truck come s, that little– 
 

A: Flipsdown. 

 

Q: Flipsdown. 

 

A: I saw a movie once that, that depicted that. 
That™s the only movie that was about the time  
that was realistic to me . It shows the truc
k Œ that™s when you knew Œ and the back flips 
down, and you™re pushed in, and then that™s it. 
 
Q: And was it, was it very rough?  Wa s 
it a very large truck or smaller–? 
 
A: Was enough to get–dozens of people. It wa
s a big truck. It took the courtyard. And the 
policemen were going on the side of the cour
tyar d toward the exit–and by that time they 

were petrified. 
 

Q: And were people screaming? 

 

A: The wome n were some what hysterical. Th
ey were crying; if you were screaming, you 
would be whipped. But sobbing prob
ably and it was not pretty. 
 

Q: Now are you in the back?  One of the last 
ones so that your mother can find–?  I me an 
these two policemen– 
 

A: At that point, my mother was following the 
policemen, so we  must ha
ve gone to the side 
of it. And she was talking to them consta
ntly, saying, ﬁLook at her, she should not be 
here, let her goﬂ. 
 

Q: Then they finally sa id– 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
57 
 
 
A: Then they said– 
 

Q: ﬁGet the hell out of hereﬂ. 

 

A: ﬁ
Eh, merde, foutez le camp! Foutez le camp!
ﬂ 
 

Q: What did they say? 

 

A: ﬁ
Merde! Foutez le camp
!ﬂ They were tired of the whole scene. 
 

Q: Were there Germans there also? 

 

A: Yes, there we re Germans, but it was such a confused set-up. There were only a few 
German soldiers; ther e were two French polic
emen who stayed out of the way; and there 
were 52 Œ I counted them Œ 52 Jews. With a lo
t of commoti on, because it™s a lot of crying 
of babies and yelling of moth
ers; they forecast the worst. 
 

Q: So, when these two guys said– 

 

A: ﬁThe hell with you!ﬂ 

 

Q: ﬁGet the hell out of here.ﬂ 

 

A: ﬁGet the hell out of here.ﬂ 

 

Q: Right. Wher e do, where did– how do you get out? 
 
A: That™s when my mother suddenly recovere
d and became a very clear-eyed mother again. 
And I became  nothing in tears. 
 

Q: At that mo ment– 

 

A: At that mo ment, the change of personality
 was unbelievable. She became  the mother-in-
charge and I became the child good-for-nothi ng 
and in tears. And then she pulled me  out. 
Well, you™d have to see the 
porte-cochère
 Œ It™s a very specific 
thing for those enormous 
ma nsions, where they used to have the carriag
es come  in with the four horses and a cart, 

right? So that™s the courtyard and the 
porte-cochère
 is opened Œ it had to be opened Œ and 
that™s the entrance that™s an enormous 
entrance, enough for the 
truck to come out. 
 

Q: And you we nt out the sa
me  way that the truck– 
 

A: Yes! We  went out by the tr
uck! The truck was occupying thewhole courtyard and we just 
sneaked away and the Ger-– the– two little 
French policemen were there and we went 

out. 
 

Q: No Ger mans saw you as far as you know?  Certain– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
58 
 
 
 
A: They were very busy. It was bedlam. 

 

Q: And as soon as you get out– 

 

A: My mother goes to Flambaum. She  crossed 
the street and I said, 
ﬁYou are out of–!ﬂ And 
we see the truck going out– with the 50 pe
ople inside. And she™s at the café terrace Œ 
terrace! Œ not even inside! On 
the terrace! She sa id, ﬁI have to have my coffee,ﬂ and she 
has her coffee. And Flambaum is patting her hand and saying, ﬁOh, 
madame
, things will 
be all rightﬂ. And so the w
hole scene was preposterous. 
 

Q: Did people in the Flam
baum know who, know what– 
 

A: There was nobody. 

 

Q: There was nobody–? 

 

A: It was very early st ill. 

 

Q: But some body was there to serve you. 

 

A: Yes, but it wasn™t a crowded 
terrace like the Montparnasse in– 
 

Q: And why do think that she went ther
e?  Wa s she just so exhausted from–? 
 

A: She just–yeah, I don™t know, e motionally, 
she was drained, wh
at you would say. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Funny how you can have your highs and then
 suddenly are completely wi ped out. And 
she always drank, drank coffee. She was a 
chain smoker and a heavy coffee drinker. 
 

Q: Now, did you stop crying as soon 
as you got out of that courtyard? 
 

A: Sure. 

 

Q: And why did, I mean, you ma y not know the 
answer to this ques
tion, but why at that 
mome nt when the two police said, ﬁHell, ge
t out of here!ﬂ, you leave, why were you 
crying then? 
 

A: I think it was, the whole 
thing was a little too much. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: I was overwhelmed. It was because  it was such an ugly scene. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
59 
 
 
Q: And you had never seen that– 
 

A: Yeah, can you imagine 50 wome n knowing th
ey are doomed?  And here I had talked with 
them five mi nutes before. And they were 
young wome n with their children. They were 
getting them younger and younger. 
 

Q: Hmm. [Long pause] Y
ou still see it, don™t you? 

 

A: Hmm?  

 

Q: You can, you can see it now, can™t you? 

 

A: Oh, sure. I™m not ma king 
any effort to– [Chuckles]. 
 

Q: To hide it. [Laughs] Did you get angry? 

 

A: No. No, not really. I never was angry, a
ll through it. I rarely, rarely get angry–doesn™t 
help. 
 

Q: But you got sad. 

 

A: Oh, that I do. And I don™t 
get revengeful either. I reme mber when Paris fell. The 
Americans ma rched down the Champs Elysées. A
nd I wanted to see the redition (ph) of 
the Germans; so I went to the Arc de Triom
phe. And the behavior of the French, who had 
been so non-committal during the war, was atrocious. They were spitting at– you know, 

by that time the Germans were putting in 
arms some  people who were 18 and– nothing 
little fellows, who had seen nothing, done not
hing. They were just ma rching, and they 
had to have their head Œ thei
r hands on their head to shame them. And the French Œ I was 
preventing the French from hurting the Germ
ans. These were the wrong ones, anyhow. 
But the scene was very ugly. The French didn™t ever behave well. 
 
Q: No ma tter what was–? 
 
A: No ma tter what was happening, 
they were wrong, on the wrong side. 
 

Q: On the other hand, you speak of at least so
me  of the war years, where the French are 
angry enough at the Germans to have a certain kind of– 
 

A: Those are popular classes that don™t go to
 the Champs Elysées to see the Americans 
march down. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: It™s very funny how it is a city, the city 
is divided; those are not the same  people. 
 

Q: Mm-hmm, s o when you say the French– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
60 
 
 
 
A: They were– We  were at Passy. You see th
e Americans ma rch at the Arch of Triumph. 
That™s near where we were, at my gr andpare
nts™ house in Passy. Those are the exquisite, 
broad avenues, and– little work
ing people were not anywhere. 
 

Q: Let™s go back to the café. You™re in the 
café and you™re seeing the trucks– One truck?  
More than one truck? 
 

A: No, one. I reme mber only one because that was the one where I would have gone and 
where the wo me n I was talking with were going. 
 

Q: And did– How long did you sit there with your mother? 

 

A: Not long, just until after they
 had gone. And then, then she d
ecided she wanted to go back 
to her apartment, where we had been captured the day before Œ the same  day! To get her 

silverware, of all things, I mean, she ne
ver– She always was one train behind, you 
know. 
 

Q: So did you go? 

 

A: Sure! 

 

Q: You went back, so– 

 

A: And the Germans, in their disorganization, ne
ver went back to that
 apartment. They had 
done their hit. 
 

Q: But you thought that they mi ght come back to– 

 

A: Well I– It wasn™t the most comfortable pl ace 
for me  to be. And to see that little fatty– 
And have you ever Œ and the crystal ware Œ ha
ve you ever piled crysta
l wa re in a box?  It 
breaks as you put it down. It was utterly absu
rd; it was very much my mother. And then 
she gave it to the neighbor downstairs to k
eep for the rest of the war. And one day, all 
after the war, it was all there. But the Ge
rmans never came back to that apartment. 
 

Q: So, she packed what she thought was valuable– 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: –and gave it to the neighbor downstairs.  

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: –And then, did you pack any cl
othes?  Did you pack anything? 
 

A: We didn™t have much. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
61 
 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. And then you went Passy to– 

 

A: Yes, to live, and we lived 
out the rest of the war there. 
And when there was the liberation 
of Paris, I reme mber that I went from Passy 
Œ it was a very short walk to the Eiffel Tower 
Œ and I reme mber the American who flew under the Eiffel Tower. They were having so 

much fun liberating Paris. They were the 
anti-Germa n. I magine, flying under the Ei ffel 
Tower. They had fun. 
 

Q: Smallplane. 

 

A: Small plane, but still– 

 

Q: You went to the apartment of your– 

 

A: –grandparents. 

 

Q: Father™s parents, right– 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Right?  That side of the family? 

 

A: That™s right.  

 

Q: And they were in Brittany. They had gone– 
 
A: They stayed in Brit
tany all through the war. 
 

Q: So you, your mother had keys to that apartment. 

 

A: Sure. 

 

Q: Yeah,okay. 

 

A: Then there was a concierge. And what is 
funny is that the concie
rge never gave us up. 
You had to– you were in danger all the tim
e. All that was necessary Œ Passy was 
surrounded by Germans ;  all the beautiful apartment buildings were occupied by 

Germans. 
 

Q: So, if this is the case, are you any lo
nger doing any work w
ith the underground?   
 

A: Idon™tremember. 

 

Q: You don™t reme mber? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
62 
 
 
A: What we did then was hide
 people in that apartment. 
 
Q: Then you hide people? 

 

A: Yes, but they were older then. But people 
who were in danger of
 being deported. I had a 
bed; it never was empty. I was heavily dati
ng, the curfew was mi dnight, so I would come  
back at mi dnight, get into my bed and it was 
full of people. Not full of people, but it was 
at least one person here, one
 person there, it would be– 
 

Q: Now, wait a mi nute. No w, 
now it™s getting complicated. 
 

A: They were people who were hiding. 

 

Q: Right, but how– how w
ould they come  to you–? 
 

A: Theyknew– 

 

Q: They knew your mother? 

 

A: They knew my mother and they knew me  and 
knew that we had survived and we were at 
Passy, they had the address and wanted an apar
tment for ove rnight. So, it served as a sort 

of a refuge.  
 

Q: For the night and then they would leave? 

 

A: Yes. And then they would have to find a permanent place where to hi de until the 
liberation of France. And that I found for 
them. I  found a mong my friends people who 
would be willing to take women, children, 
whatever, for years to come. And it was 
ma gnificent. At that point, among fri e nds, 
that you found people who were willing to 
help, really to help. And I kept, kept t
hose friends on both ends. The people who took 

care of the pe ople who were taken care  of Œ I saw them until they died.  
 

Q: And, and how–? 

 

A: In the living room, I re member one. I was 
talking with friends 
of the fate of a young 
woma n that I knew whose husband had been ta
ken, and nephew had been killed at the 
age of 18 months. The whole fa mily was abso
lutely destroyed. And she was beginning a 
pregnancy so she really wanted that child, 
because her husband just
 had been taken. And 
she came to live with us at Passy. And then 
I saw a friend one day when she was there, 

and I said, ﬁWho on earth is going to be able 
to take you, pregnant, for the rest of your 
pregnancy, to salvage the child
?ﬂ And the friend said, ﬁI will!ﬂ And she had her in her 
living room Œ she had a very small place Œ 
for the remainder of the year. And they 
became the best of friends after the war. They
 did Œ had two houses with joint backyards. 
But then, they never forget. I will. So, there were some  individual cases of French 

devotion.

Q: So, how ma ny people did you help, you and your mother, do you think? 
 

A: [Sighs] That was a flow–I don™t know how long– you had the– we have to think of 
dates, that wa s ™43, ™44. 
It was just one year– 
 

Q: Right, one year. 

 

A: One year. And then the Americans debarked
 and that was over. Although they continued 
deporting, but I didn™t know it then. 
 

Q: But you were not hiding. You were heavily– 
You describe yourself
 as heavily dating! 
So, you™re going out?  Who are you going out with? 
 

A: If you– you can–If you were cute, you 
can alwa ys find a man [Laughs]. 
 

Q: Were these boys in the underground
?  I mean, there™s not a lot of men– 
 

A: Medical, me dical doctors like my brothe
r, anybody who was in one of those higher 
schools of higher learning were there. 
 

Q: Did you fall in love a lot? 

 

A: Hmm?  

 

Q: Did you fall in love a lot? 

 
A: Constantly. 
 

Q: Constant– 

 

A: The door opened and there I was. [Laughs] 

 

Q: Yes?  

 

A: Yes, I dated–I reme mb er, I dated several 
times during the evening. And the best date 
was around ten o™clock. Six 
o™clock, not very good; eight wasn
™t really better, but the ten 
o™clock date was really the serious one of
 the evening. That was– my heavy dating, 
nothing ever happened, but it was very exhilarating. 
 

Q: So, you would date three guys in one–? 

 

A: Oh, yes, uh-huh.  

 

Q: So, what would you do?  Dinner with
 one and drinks with another–? 
 

A: Yes,right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
64 
 
 
 
Q: Isee. 

 

A: Mm-hmm. And Paris is a l
ovely city where to walk. 
 

Q: Was– were people sexually 
free during this time or not?   
 

A: NotI. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: No. I don™t think it was at all the morals 
of the generation. You are talking to some body 
who is in her 80s. That was 60 years ago, you 
know. I think that behavior is only in the 
last– It became  much more lax in America 
with my daughter™s generation. But I had not 
seen it in my generation.  
 

Q: So, when you say it was more– the 10 o™cloc
k date– I don™t know if you planned it like 
this, but 10 o™clock, it was more 
exciting. Is that because the–? 
 

A: Kissing. 

 

Q: Uh-huh, so there was a lot of–? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Yeah, of course, very exciting. 
 
A: So, that™s why it had to be that time. 

 

Q: So, did you choose people you were dating at
 the particular hours?  You knew what was 
going to happen, sort of? 
 

A: Well, we ma de an appointme nt.  

 

Q: Were you frightened of being caught? Or you didn™t care? 

 

A: Anyhow, when you are out with a guy, you don™t 
feel that frightened. No, I didn™t have 
the tendency to feel fright ened. 
 

Q: Were you now carrying around your
 baptisma l papers or not? 
 

A: I could not find them for  the life of me . They ar e not important. [Laughs] 

 

Q: What did your I.D. card sa
y?  Nothing?  Just your name . 
 

A: That, I probably could find it. I have it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
65 
 
 
 
Q: You do have it? 

 

A: I had it; it did say my na me . I never destr
oyed papers, so some where in a box, I mi ght Œ if 
I find it, I™ll send it to you. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: At the museu m.  

 

Q: And how, how are you getting coupons for f
ood?  I mean, you™re not 
working, right?  Or 
are you working?   
 

A: No, but my mother c
ould collect for, for us. 
 

Q: Because she™s working for– She™s still working–? 

 

A: No, no you could not. No, no, this is the offici
al French governme nt that gave them at the 
mairie
 and 
mairie
, at the– 
 

Q: Wasgivingcoupons? 

 

A: Yes, you get your coupons every mo nth. Everybody did. 

 

Q: So, is your mother at home  all the time  now?   

 
A: When? 
 

Q: After, after the arrest, when you go to Passy? 

 

A: I forgot, I tell you. The food, as I sai
d, was very, of very mi nima l interest. 
 

Q: Was this a ha rd time , that year? 

 

A: [Shakeshead] 

 

Q: Itwasn™t? 

 

A: No, I– The hard time s was the Germ
an occupation, you know. For instance, during 
the– when the Americans liberated us, we ha
d Œ it was ™45, the Battle of the Bulge Œ one 
of the hardest winters we ever had. We had 
no heat whatsoever and it didn™t ma tter. I 
reme mber when we invited an American fo
r dinner. He was the one who introduced me  
to my husba nd. He came , he was flabbergasted that we had absolutely nothing. You 

know, it was a polenta-type of thing. And from
 then on, he brought us the supplies; he 
was very generous and fun. But we didn™t suffer.
 We ate whatever there wa s to be eaten.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474

Q: Andthat– 
 

A: It isn™ t that important in lif
e. The freedom was what mattered. 
 

Q: We™re going to take a break and –

Tape #6 
 
Q: So, you™re telling me  that after the arrest, 
that year, until liberati
on Œ not after liberation, 
which ma y have had all sort of difficulties at
tached to it Œ that  it wasn™t so diffi cult. 
 

A: Afterliber ation?  

 

Q: No, no, no, no. That– 

 

A: Theyear... 

 

Q: From ™43, when you were arrested and– 

 

A:  We fel t  safe. 

 

Q: You felt safe. 

 

A: After– If you were going to be given in by 
the concierge, it™s going 
to take place in two 
weeks. 
 

Q: Mm-h mm.  

 

A: If not, she™s not goi
ng to say anything.  
 

Q: Some thing. Was there any communication 
with your grandparen
ts in Brittany? 
 
A: Sure. 
 

Q: You were writing? 

 

A: Sure. 

 

Q: So, they knew whether you were okay or you were not okay? 

 

A: They must have, I must have the letters– 

 

Q: Was there censorships of letters? We re the German–? 

 

A: Yes, there wa s, but you– there are ways 
of going around it. If they were fa mily Œ I 
should have brought you one I have
--I found a hil- hilarious one 
of my br other™s from the 
Pyrenees experience in France. It was– th
ey we re typed; they were printed by the 
Germans. And I better gi ve them to you because
 the print is disappearing. If it isn™ t good 
paper, you know, the printing it become s very, 
very white out. But it™
s all printed so is 
tué, 
killed. It™s for people like war killed, 
tué, blessé, fatigué, décédé, provision. 
I mean, 
the things that really matter
ed. And you had no right to writ
e anything that had not to do 
with the imme diacies of da
ily living. I mean, people find a way of– And you, you find a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
68 
 
 
way of writing. You should see how mi crosc
opic your handwriting can be. And they let 
it, they let it ride. And you can imagine th
e German spending his 
day looking at those 
cards going by. 
 
Q: And your grandparents were okay during the 
whole time , in Brittany, as far as you know. 
 
A: Oh,unfazed. 

 

Q: Unfazed? 

 

A: Unfazed. I mean, they had a property, they we
re  solidly establishe d. They spent, I told 
you, they spent most of the year in Brittany, mo
st of their older lives. And although it was 

very uncomfortable, it was a beautiful set-
up and they were safe. I don™t think they 
worried. 
 

Q: Now what, what news were getting about th
e progress of the war and also what the Nazis 
are doing to Jews?  Are 
you now getting more–? 
 

A: Nothing. 

 

Q: Nothing? Nothing! 

 

A: Nothing, I think– I don™t reme mber . 

 

Q: Are there newspapers? There are 
news papers. Did they say anything? 
 
A: The newspapers were censored. [laughs] 
The correspondence between people ma y have 
been censored but if there was one thing th
at was censored, it was the newspapers and– 
so you learn practically noth-– In fact, I kn
ew nothing about the American debarkation 
from the German-French and French newspaper. 
 
Q: And you™re not getting rumors? 

 

A: I didn™t hear one word of rumor. 

 

Q: It™sfunny– 

 

A: We were expecting, expecting, expecting. 
It was kind of joke. I reme mbe r  a neph-– a 
nephew of mi ne Œ two, two and a 
half Œ and he was spending the night at Passy with me , 
at the pl ace we were. And he was learning 
to speak and he was bouncing on the bed. And 

I reme mber the thing that he was saying, ﬁ
Les Américains sont à Paris
.ﬂ or whatever; he 
was bouncing on the bed. I mean, there was 
some  knowledge, but it was after the fact; 
they were already there. 
 

Q: So, didn™t know anyone who had a ra
dio of some kind that could get–? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
69 
 
 
A: BBC?  
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: The Jews, their radios we re taken. Oh, th
ey, they were very thorough. To have no radio, 
no communication, the, the subway was full of
 radios. You know why?  Because the Jews 
put their radios in the subway, 
and we put one in the subway.  
 

Q: But how about non-Jews?  They had radios. 

 

A: Yeah, I have seen that in the movies, 
but I don™t reme mber in France sitting around the 
radio listening, I don™t. 
 

Q: So, you are blank, you have no idea how long th
is was going to last, how short it™s going 
to last? You can™t tell? 
 

A: It had to end. 

 

Q: It had to end? 

 

A: It had to end; you were getting kind of t
ongue sticking out and panting. By that time, it 
had lasted quite a long but–we knew– When 
was it?  I didn™t think that–I reme mber 
one episode. I wrote it– It
™s after the American la
nded. Somebody– saw a truck, an 
American truck, and touched the wheel, the, th
e, the tire. And the ti
re was real rubber. 
And he communicated to everybody that th
e Americans were going to win the war 
because we were sick in 
ersatz
 by now. Nothing was real you know; everything was 
ersatz
. Those were people with real
 rubber, they had it ma de. 
 

Q: [Laughs] That™s funny. Y
ou never got depressed? 
 

A: I™m not a depressed type. No, with old age,
 when I had that massive stroke, that was a 
time when I was depressed. It was very depressing to find my self completely paralyzed. 

But then, you bounce back. 
 

Q: So, nothing during the war, even those– 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: You would get sad or you would–? 

 

A: No, depressed is not the word, no. 

 

Q: No?  What word would you use? 

 

A: At some  poi nt, I was overwhelmed.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
70 
 
 
Q: Okay. 
 

A: I was overwhelmed because, to this day, it is beyond my huma ne understanding to see 
that extent of cruelty. That 
was, that was unbelievable– That
 a nation could then inflict 
that on their neighbors– and a na
tion civilized. I was a studen
t; therefore, the idea that 
those guys were usuall
y learned people, they were not 
savages from the depth of the 
jungle, they came from universiti
es. And they coul
d live through it. 
 

Q: So what did it–? 

 

A: It™s not individually. As a nation, it overwhe
lmed me . And that wasn™t depression; that 
was just amazement. To this day, I don™t– I don™t understand what went on. 
 

Q: Did it in any way at that time, not now, 
but at that time ma ke you cynical about huma n 
beings and about education?  Did it ma ke you 
wonder what was the point of education if 
people–? 
 

A: Oh, no! That I never wondered, no, because that
 was also my salvation– You get lost in 
a good book Œ that™s it, you 
found your salvation. 
 
Q: But then it seems that education doesn™t 
protect some one, to be– to rema in civilized. 
 

A: No, but I never felt thought philosophical
ly about it; I just acted when needed. 
 

Q: Mm-hmm. And your– well, 
go ahead, you™re thinking of– 
 
A: Hmm?  
 

Q: You™re thinking about some thing. 
What do you want to say, some thing? 
 

A: No. I don™t know. My short-time memory is gone. 

 

Q: Did your– I know that said that after your– Go ahead. 

 

A: No, I was having a funny thought. I wa s thinki
ng one thing that came 
of the war. I told 
you how cold people were. It was unbelieva
ble that the walls were dripping wet. 
Dripping wet from humi dity, you know, no heat 
in the building for five years and then 
there were the walls. And– what was I thinking? Oh, you lived in bed. To this day my 

favorite pl ace is my bed. You absolutely li
ved in bed because that was the warm place 
you could control and you coul
d do practically everything. No
t talking about even the 
love part, which we didn™t ma ke, but you 
could eat, you could rea
d, you could write, you 
could talk. And when I me t John, I received– I 
received my  dates in my bed. They sat 
around, and I reme mber John, covered with hi
s uniform beca use the apartment was so 

cold, sitting by my right side
 and we had conversation. That
™s the way I entertained. 
 

Q: So, there was no heat the whole time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
71 
 
 
 
A: Uh-uh. I think there were two week– two w
eekends– I, I know that before that there 
were two weekends. That™s almost nothing. In one room, one r oom.  
 

Q: Then there™s no hot water? 

 

A: No hot water ever. No stockings. That came with the Americans. 

 

Q: So were you always cold even–? 

 

A: Yeah, you, you were alwa ys feeling damp and 
cold, yes. That was the– to me , that was 
the worst part of the war. 
 

Q: Just a constant physical discomfort. 

 

A: Of the cold. 

 

Q: Of the cold.  

 

A: Not the hunger at all. 

 

Q: I wonder then– 

 

A: It takes, no, it takes nothing to fill you up. 
You can eat a little bread
 and you are satisfied. 
And I was young and slim. 
 
Q: Did you lose weight during the war? 
 

A: No, I kept my weight. 

 

Q: Really? 

 

A: No, you– you had a very unhealthy but fatteni
ng diet. Bread is fa
ttening. We had bread 
and flour. That we did ha
ve Œ a sort of polenta. 
 

Q: Hmm. What  did you drink ma in
ly, coffee or wine, or both? 
 

A: I told you, there was no coffee. Come on, coff
ee is an exotic thing. You can™t coffee any 
more than you can have tobacco. They don™t 
come  from Fra nce. France doesn™t cultivate 
that sort of plant. So, what– We  did have 
wine. There was, I told
 you, a ration of wine. I 
didn™t drink any. Wa ter, 
so I only drank water. 
 

Q: H mm.  

 

A: There were no soft drinks. 
Ah, that™s a magnificent thing th
at they did to us. You kept 
your figure. There was nothing Œ the sugar wa
s out, there was no sugar. There was no, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
72 
 
 
what™s that, no butter, no fats. No fats. On
e time a week, I mea n, there was nothing to be 
fat Œ a lot of vegetables and fruit.
 It was the perfect sl ender di et. 
 
Q: But you did have vegetables and fruit? 

 

A: In France, we  sure did. And we went to farms to pick them up. You picked up your 
cherries. You had friends who lived in th
e country and you– I went
 50 miles a day on 
my bicycle to pick up cherries from the tree, to pick up strawberries from the ground. It 

was a very– They were precious things 
that you had. But no fat Œ no fat on you. Nobody 
Œ that™s the thing Œ there was, 
at the end of the war, not one
 obese person in France. They 
all died. They couldn™t take the diet.  
 

Q: But your mo ther you said was fat. 

 

A: She lost– she lost it. She was extremely thin by the end the– 

 

Q: She was thin by the end of the war? 
 
A: Sure. 

 

Q: Did she gain it back? 

 

A: So me .  

 

Q: So me .  

 
A: A Jewish mother, she would ma nage. 
 

Q: So, how did you have the time 
to bicycle out to the country? 
 

A: Well, there were weekends. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: Even if you work, you have weekends. I 
would do, I would do the 
whole thing in one 
day. I reme mber, I would do the 50, 50 miles a day.  
 

Q: But how would you keep the food?
 There™s no electric, there™s no– 
 

A: Thebalcony. 

 

Q: I see, outside. And in the summer, t hen what? 

 

A: You ate it. 

 

Q: You just ate it fast. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
73 
 
 
 
A: It isn™ t that warm in Paris. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: I reme mber when we first, when I was first ma rried and we had a ma id. We had to 
have– I had an American husband; we 
had a ma gnificent apartment overlooking the 
Luxembour g Gardens. And he absolutely insi
sted we have an icebox. I had never heard 
of that. So, we had an icebox. She said, 
ﬁWhat are we going to put in it? ﬂ I still 
reme mber, ﬁMadame Ni cole, what are we going 
to put in the icebox to please Mr. John? ﬂ  
So, we would think, and we would find some
thing to put in the icebox to please the 
American. But she would put– You see, they ha
d those, those things in the windows. To 

this day, if you go to Paris to an old apartment,
 in the kitchen, there 
is an opening in the 
window in the kitchen and it is sort of a 
me shed window, and all the food was there. 
That™s– the refr iger ation, and it works for them. 
For that sort of very mo derate weather, 
it works. And then also you have the shops. 
You shop everyday. It™s a different way of 
life. 
 

Q: So, when do you get an inkling that the Ge
rmans are finished?  Only
 when the Americans 
ma r c h  i n ?  
 

A: When we saw the rubber tire. The Amer
icans were overwhelming. When you saw them 
come  down the Champs Elysées, you know that
 it could not be resisted. In a, in a 
different way– it was a maelstrom of strengt
h and a fresh strength. By that time , the 

Germans we re beaten. They were down to their last troops, to th
eir youngest soldiers. 
They were demoralized– 
 

Q: And you saw that? 

 

A: And you could see that in the type of sold
iers that they wouldsend in the streets. 
 

Q: Now, you said earlier that you tried to st
op people who were throwing– were spitting at 
the soldiers? 
 

A: At– that wa s at the liberation of Paris. Wh
at was the name of the–? Ther e is st ill that  
hotel. There is the Arch of Triumph and th
en there is a street
– L™Attala– No, not 
l™Attala; it wa s another name . There was a huge
 hotel facing the Champs Elysées and the 
Arch of Triumph at an angle. And that™s when
 I saw, all that, and then the Avenue Foche 
and that– They were ma rching. 
 

Q: Am, a m I correct that you also sa
w wome n whose heads had been shaved? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And what did you–? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
74 
 
 
A: And I protected them.  
 

Q: You protected them? From what? 

 

A: Yes, from that. I shamed the people who was doing it because they were wr ong. There 
were the same  ones who would sleep with the Americans. They would sleep with, they 

would sleep with– These were not the, the ugl
y fighters. They were just easy to catch 
and it was ugly and it was demeaning of the 
people who did it as we
ll as the people, and 
it was very ugly to watch–very ugly to watch.  
 

Q: But it happened all over– 

 

A: And it– and the people who were doing 
it probably were the people who had done 
nothing to resist the German
 occupation. But they hit on– maybe they we re worthless 
but it was nonsensical; it was beside the point
. And they ma rched them the same  wa y that 

they ma rched the young soldiers wi
th their hands on their– head. 
 

Q: That they did it in public, it was very humiliating. 

 

A: Again around at the Arch of Triump h, the same  route.  

 

Q: So, the time was ugly, the time after was ugly– 

 

A: There were– Yes, I don™t want to give 
you the impression that the whole life was ugly. 
But those were very ugly scenes. It seems th
at people took their wo
rst possible feelings 
and they had a way of expressing those very 
ugly feelings. And they took an opportunity 
and it hit at the wrong target. 
 

Q: Did anyone threaten you when you tried– when you were protecting these wome n? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Really? 

 

A: They were ashame d. 

 

Q: Theywere? 

 

A: They were ashame d at what they were doing. I saw Arletty, you know, the– the great 
actress who– She had a fabulous word, they shav
ed her head. She slept with Stülpnagel, 
was the name of the general in charge
 of France. And her answer was, ﬁ
Mon cœur est à la 
France, mais mon con est internationale.
ﬂ And I thought that was good. My heart 
belongs to Fr ance, but my cunt is international. [Laughs]  
 

Q: [Laughing]Yeah. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
75 
 
 
A: That is sort of a woma n who– she would 
have– So, she slept with a general occupying 
the– She would have slept with an American
 general if he had been mo re than that 
rubber tire ________. She would have b
een better than ma ny. [Laughing] 
 
Q: [Laughs] So, what is it like, t
hose first few months of liberation? 
 

A: [Sighs] 

 

Q: It™s still not easy. 

 

A: No, but who cares about the phys
ical when you are 21?  It was– 
 

Q: Actually,you™re 
a little older by now. 
 

A: By now ™40, 23. 

 

Q: 23,yeah. 

 

A: And I don™t accept the, the, the 
couvre-feu
 was still at mi dnight. They kept , they kept  you 
out of the streets at night. 
The streets were dangerous. But 
your dates Œ my dates always 
took me home. I re me mber, my mot her was wa
iting on the balcony, so 
they all knew that; 
they stopped at the corner of the street, because my mother was going to pounce on them. 

[Laughs] It was fun. Ye ah, I didn™t–We  didn™t 
think in those terms. We didn™t think in 
terms of Œ it™s now that we™re thinking in thos
e terribl e terms. We just lived with it and 
were swallowed by it. The same  wa y when I look
 at the Martin Luther King thing, this is 
history at the time. You live through it; we di
dn™t ma ke such a point of saying, ﬁThis is 
the march of the–this is the year  where we 
are beginning to end this
 sort of racial–ﬂ 
You don™t think in those terms.  
 
Q: The war is not finally over, however, when France is liberated, when Paris is liberated. 
There™s still–there™s still time.  
 

A: Then the Battle of the Bulge come s in. Then we party. What happens– but what was 
very interesting is that y
ou never stopped the partying. Wh
at happened is that it was 
everybody brings, so everybody brought some th
ing. And if you didn™t have much, you 
didn™t have much. You had the party and 
you had the dancing, you had the music, you 
had the youth. And then you walked home . It™s wa lkable, again. You can you go to a 

party practically Œ and also the people, you 
know, are all in the same milieu, so they 
live– I can circumscribe Paris. Some
body, oh, Mendes-France is having a boulevard 
named after him in the 13
th
. I don™t even know where is the 13
th
 in the city. I never set 
foot in the pl ace. The 4
th
 arrondisseme nt is where the Mara
is is; that one there, never 
again. I know 14
th
, the 15
th
, the 16
th
, the 17
th
 is wealthy but I never go, the 18
th
 is 
Montma rtre, I never set foot in it, and the 19
th
 is where the young live now but it™s awful. 
The 20
th
 and 21
st
, never heard of it. 
 

Q: So you went– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
76 
 
 
 
A: And again, the Opera, I mean, it is small 
and you can see that you really, when you think 
of it, you go to Tuileries Garden, it™s the same
, very circumscribe arrondissement. I™m not 
a specialist in Paris. 
 

Q: Hmm. So, you partied? 

 

A: Sure, everybody partied. 

 

Q: Including people who were more adult than
 you, older?  Your moth
er?  That generation?  
No, not–? 
 

A: It was, oh no, no, no, no, no, I™m talking about
 the 20-year-olds. No, because, then you 
had to go– Then, you had to walk ho me – You have to walk home , because it™s really 

pitch dark. There™s the blac
kout, and the blackout means 
that you see nothing in the 
street. And you don™t have any el
ectric light or anything.  
 

Q: Now–  

 

A: So, you tripped. 

 

Q: [Laughs] So, you have to be young. 

 

A: Yes, it™s, it™s for, it™s for th
e young. You don™t find anybody past their 40™s. 
 

Q: Does the organization of your life change
d drastically when the Americans come  in?  
Obviously, you™re– you™re free. 
 

A: Because of my mother, yes. 

 

Q: And what does that me a n? 

 

A: That was lifted, she was safe, I mean, we all– 

 

Q: So you didn™t have to worry? 

 

A: No. That™s a huge change. 

 

Q: Right. And is your aunt still with her?  

 

A: Oh,sure! 

 

Q: So they™re all the– 

 

A: You know, lived all thro
ugh their lives together. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
77 
 
 
Q: Together. So, now you know you can go out and party and do what you will?  You don™t 
have to worry about anything happening? 
 
A: Well, I could Œ I always did go out and part
y, except now the worry is lifted. But I never 
was that much of a worrier. My brother was mor e  the worrier than I. 
 

Q: Did he come  back to Paris once the Americans came ? 

 

A: No, he settled in Normandy. He wanted– I wa
nted to be a small fish in a big town; he 
liked to be a huge fish in a very small town. 
So he settled in the provinces where I would 
never set foot. 
 

Q: And where was his, where was his wife a
nd child at the time? Di
d they go with him? 
 

A: Yeah. They bought a big estate and settled 
and bought a big ma nsi
on and settled private 
hospital. 
 

Q: But where was his wife and child during the 
war?  ‚Cause he had le
ft and gone across to 
the Pyrenees, yes? 
 

A: Well, he wasn™t ma rried th
en. That wa s ™40. That was– 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: That was the comi ng– the moving in of the army. He ma rried in ™42, ™43– 

 
Q: But during the war, he ma rried? 
 

A: Oh,yeah. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And he had children during the war. Since th
ey were playing with 
us at the liberation. 
 

Q: And so, when was the first time you sa
w your brother after 1940?  ™44?  ™45? 
 

A: He came ba ck [laughs]– I reme mb er, when it is over, him comi ng back. He had had Œ I 
saw it some where in an article recently Œ he
 had had one towel for the whole time  when 

he was out, so he used the same  towel. It 
was so dirty, it was sti
ff! He brought it back! 
That™s what I reme mber of his return
. But he returned in ma ybe ™42, ™43. 
 

Q: Really?  So before the liberation he returned? 

 

A: Oh, yes, since he was, he was a doctor, so he was safe. 

 

Q: That™s right. That™s ‚cause he wa
s comi ng everyday to ma ke sure that– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
78 
 
 
 
A: He was again–what do you call that?  A hor
se?  A running horse– He was intern, you 
know. To be intern in me dicine is mo re than to
 be an extern, or to be just a plain doctor. 
He was really competitive and very good at, at hi s job, so he was completely safe. He was 

name d Michel Denier and he– 
 

Q: Did he have a bapt
ism certificate too? 
 

A: He didn™t, no. 

 

Q: Hedidn™t?  

 

A: No, but he had been with the, the– He
 had been a scout and that was with the 
Protestants. And the Protestant
s, the mome nt they tried to touch him, they pounced back 
and said, ﬁNot at all, he has been a scout si
nce he was the age of 
nine, don™t touch himﬂ .  
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: So, he was protected by the Protestant
s and I was protected 
by the Catholics. 
 

Q: And your mother was, who knows?  [Laughs] 

 

A: [Laughs] She swam through, pr
obably didn™t know how to swim. 
 

Q: All right, we have to change the tape.

Tape #7 
 
Q: How, how did it happen that you started 
working in Switzerland?  What, what– was–? 

 

A: In fact, there were five girls Œ because we were all in our– between 20 and 25 Œ who 
were chosen by the French government to thank 
them for their work in the war, to go to 
Switzerland, which was paradise and chocolate,
 to take care of the remnants of people 
from the camps. They landed– they couldn™t– they were untrans-– People could not 

be transported. They were too sick to be sent
 to their country of 
origin, were sent to 
Switzerland, and who had– which had rema ined
 nastily– neutral during the war. They 
are still fighting the issue in 2003. But they we
re ﬁneutralﬂ during th
e war, but at least 
they offered the hospitals. They had fantastic
ally modern hospitals, in particul ar in 
Davos, that you see now on the T.V., which is
 a ski resort, agreed, but it had best 
tubercular hospitals in Europe. And so they 
accepted– the stretche r 
cases were sent fr om 
the camp to Switzerland. And I was sent to Sw
itzerland to take the– to wait until they 
were no longer stretcher cases and th
en transpor t them back to Paris. 
 

Q: How were you five chosen?  Who– 
This is in– This is in ™46? 
 

A: That was after the– ™45. 

 

Q: This is ™45. So who chooses you?  I m
ean, what– who in the governme nt knows that 
you™re doing this? 
 

A: Oh, I had a boyfriend. 

 
Q: Uh-huh. 
 

A: Who was high in governme nt. 

 

Q: Do you want to name  him or
 you don™t want to name  hi m?  
 

A: He was na med Jean Iliovissy (ph) and now 
he™s working at the U.N., probably is dead. 
 

Q: So, he me ntioned your name ?  

 

A: Well, I had a reputation; I had the papers
, I had the figures to prove. But he pushed 
certainly. 
 

Q: So the– is– you had not me t your husband to be yet? 

 

A: No I me t him, I me t him in
 December ™46. No, December ‚45. 
 

Q: So this is– 

 

A: ™45. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
80 
 
 
 
Q: This is™45 and you™re in Switzerland
 for about six months, am I correct? 
 

A: Yes, six mo nths. I was working in Geneva 
and then Saint Martin 
(ph) and then Davos. 
 

Q: And what were you supposed to do for these folks, these people? 

 

A: I was what you call a social 
worker. My job was as vague as
 the job of a social worker, 
which infuriates my daughter, who™s an activ
e lawyer. I was a social worker, so I™d 

would vi-– visit them, cheer them up–take 
them out, ma ke them 
walk, and– visitwith 
them. I was with them when they died and 
I encouraged them to go out, walk and get 
back into life. 
 

Q: These were not just Fr ench– 
These weren™t French citizens?  
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: They were all French citizens?  

 

A: At that time, they were a
ll French citizens. They were Œ 
no, excuse me , there were a few 
other nationalities, but al most all of th
em were French. And some  of the m had 
tuberculosis and some  of them were complete
ly emaciated. I probably fell in love with 
one. It was absolutely glorious. Switzerland 
can be glorious. I didn™t like them. They 
would, they would say– what did they say?  Th
ey had such a terrible sentence. ﬁOne of 
your– one of your deportees–ﬂ O
h, what happened is that they stole. They came back 
from the camp and they had been hungry, and 
they were in the land of plenty and you 
would put a ma rvelous table and they stole fr
om each other. And it was almost instinctive 

and they did. And the Swiss, I reme mber th
em s a ying to me , ﬁOne of you deportees has 
stolen again.ﬂ And it really hurt me because
 it was a complete mi sunderstanding of who 
they were. They were like animals; they 
had been hungry for so long that they couldn™t 
resist. You had to have the understanding th
at the Swiss didn™t. But they had the food. 
And the fresh air. So that they got better
. And they had very good hospitals, very good 
hospitals, and the hospital car
e was great. And my  job was to be, you know, to come  in 
the room and be fresh and available. And so
me  to them woul d die and I would call the 
fa mily and be there when they died and comfor
t the fa mily and be present at the funeral. 
The presence was enormous for them at the time, a friendly presence. 
 

Q: And there were five of you from Paris doing this? 

 

A: Hmm?  

 

Q: There were fi ve young wome n doing this? 

 

A: No, they were sent to different– 

 

Q: Ah, they were sent to different places. 
And you were the one sent to Switzerland?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
81 
 
 
 
A: I was the one sent to Switzer land. 

 

Q: And what happened to the 
boy you had fallen in love with? 
 

A: I– euh–he died very recently. I kept  in 
touc h. I became very friendly to his wife. He 
was a ma rvelous fellow. He was not a Jewish 
deportee, he was a political deportee. And 
he wasn™t from Auschwi t z; he was from Ma
uthausen, which was second worst. Those 

were death camps. 
 

Q: So, you™re there in ™45. Have you yet seen
 photographs, news reel
s of anything that 
happened in–? 
 

A: In Switzerland?  [Shakes head] 

 

Q: Before you went, nothing?  So, the knowledge 
that you have is from
 people telling you 
what happened? 
 

A: And dealing with them, seeing the way they 
look and seeing them die. The amplitude of 
it was there because they had suffered it. 
But I ha d volunteered to be taking care of 
children survivors and that™s because there 
were no children survi
vors that I had been 
sent as a sort of compensation to take car
e of other people who had survived. Then I 
would accompany the convoy back to France. 
 

Q: You mean, when people woul
d get well, that you would–? 
 
A: When they were feeling well, then I would– 
 

Q: You would take them back. 

 

A: Take them like a nurse. 

 

Q: But you wanted to take care of 
children, but there were no children–? 
 

A: There were none. I was told there were 
none, there were not. When you look at history 
there were not convoys of surviving cases ta
ken care of by the Swiss. There were not. 
 

Q: There were hidden chil
dren, but they obviously di
dn™t come  to Switzerland. 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: And why did you stop working in Switzerland
?  You were there for six– Wa s it only for 
a certain period of time, or 
everybody from France was okay, or unfortunately had died 
and then you came back?  
 

A: Yeah, after six months– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
82 
 
 
 
Q: Did you then meet you husband or is
 it then that you were with UNRRA. 
 

A: It was– in December ™45 that I me t John fo
r– It was at the end of– It was after my 
return. 
 

Q: FromSwitzerland? 

 

A: Mm-h mm.  

 

Q: And you fell in love with him– quickly? 

 

A: Right off, as well. But then the other one 
was in my life, and they me t in the subway. I 
reme mber, they didn™t like each other at all. 
 

Q: The two me n you were involved with. 

 

A: Yes, the deportee– 

 

Q: Uh-huh. I see. 

 

A: They didn™t like it. I still reme mber the m
eeting. They me t in the subway, they greeted 
each other. But there was no– 
 

Q: But they didn™t like each other. 

 
A: No,no. 
 

Q: And did you like John immediately better then 
you liked this other 
guy?  Or were you not 
sure?  
 

A: The other guy lasted in my life a long time. 

 

Q: Hedid? 

 

A: In my life, I mean, not in actuality, but in 
flirting. Because he had been a real hero and 
that he had a halo that John didn™t have. 
John spending one night on the beaches, it wa s 
enough for him, you know, he absolutely loat
hes discomfort. I don™t think he was ever 
without a real breakfast once in
 his life. But he still will talk
 about that night on the sa nd. 
And I told you that he would, he would bur
n a tree and he™d burn the furniture to be 
warm. No, he was no great hero. But one reas
on I ma rried John was that he was a strong 
character. He  came from Tulsa and he  was 
a conscientious objector. And in– He had 
one of his closest friends, I me ntioned toyou, that Mauricio Fr eidman, who was a genius, 

a Jew, was also a conscientious objector, but
 he was for religious reasons and John was 
for philosophical reasons. And in Tulsa, they 
said, ﬁPhilosophical reasons, five years of 
hard labor.ﬂ So you went to the, the prison 
where the assassin is, wherever, a prison in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
83 
 
 
Oklahoma, which is the pits. And he spent one 
year there. And he got
 to the library and 
he started organizing the comi ng of t he books to
 read. He thought he 
would cover a lot of 
reading in five years. And then he wa
s pardoned, and in one day, he was shipped 
overseas. So, that™s the way, you know. But then
 he had, he had done some thing with his 
life. And he is quite a character. 
 
Q: How was he  shipped if he 
was a conscientious objector? 
 

A: Because they pardoned him. They first conde
mned him for hard labor, and then, after a 
year, or whoever was the President pardoned 
him, they got him;  the sa me  day, he was 
shipped overseas to England and then from England to France. 
 

Q: So, you figured this was strong character. 

 

A: Well he, he was. He was and I told y
ou the way he understood the suffering of my 
mother. 
 

Q: How do you understand–?   

 

A: And he would hide, he w ould hide rations. You know, we 
had those beautiful curtains, 
silk curtains. And after John had gone out, we
 would look and there were those sardine 
boxes, hidden beneath the folds of the country
 curtains. He was ge nerous and he had a 
feeling for, for suffering, and he had never 
seen or done anything hims elf. Except once, 
we went wherever it was, we went where th
ey have the most– in San Francisco they 
have a terrible prison. Wh
at was the name of it? 
 
Q: Alcatraz? 
 

A: Alcatraz. We went to Alcatraz. We  went
 with a group of judges and John was a top 
lawyer, and we were there with the judges. A
nd we were in a cell in Alcatraz. And they 
put you in the cell individually and then they lo
ck, to give you the feel of what it me ans 
to be a prisoner in Alcatraz. And John said
 to me  in passing, ﬁI™m the only one in the 
crowd who knows what it is to be in a real pr
ison with a locked door.ﬂ For he had spent 
one year in it. 
 

Q: What, what do you think is, what is it 
about John that enabled him to understand the 
suffering that you and your mother went th
rough, or that– what happened?  Do you have 
any idea? 
 

A: Do you call that a big heart?
 I don™t, I don™t know. He™s a liberal at heart. Anything that 
smacks of– imposing your will on you because of the race or anythi ng– He was born a 

liberal, and his family, too. His– our grandpare
nts and his pa rents just adored each ot her. 
They spoke not a word in common a nd they ba
bbled away, Catholic 
grandparents. It was 
a joke! We ll, my grandmother had been raised
 with some  Engl ish, so she could speak a 
few words. How you can go with people just
 on feelings without any vocabulary is 
amazing, gestures. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
84 
 
 
 
Q: So, did you see John for about a month in December? 

 

A: Very little, ve ry little. I wa
s heavily dating el sewhere, and it was absolutely spat  at to date 
somebody i n uniform in Paris. We were– We™d
 go to a theater together; we received 

insults when we would come  down the aisl e.
 Really, insults. Because I wa s dating a 
soldier. You just did not da
te the conquering soldier. It
 was spat upon by the French.  
 

Q: In spite of the fact that
 these were soldiers who had– 

 

A: Oh, the French never liked 
to be– It is not easy to be liberated by some body that you do 
not respect intellectually, and 
also some one so ne w. To this day I™m getting the articles 
about how, the same  thing, they think we ar
e young and innocent in a bad sense of the 
word. So, they were very– antagonistic. So, when we would go out outside, it was 

courage to go out with a then-Ame rican so
ldier because you did ge
t passing insults. 
 

Q: So, did you ask him not to wear his uniform?  
Or he had to wear his uniform all the time ?  
 

A: Well, of course, and I– He was liberating us. 

 

Q: Did he propose to you very quickly? 

 

A: He proposed to me  very quickly, if you c
ount– He stayed three 
weeks in France and 
then they were shipped back to the Stat
es. That had been from– He was gone by the 

time of 27
th
 of January; he left around mi ddle Ja
nuary. So, if you count the time where I 
am very bus y dating, it™s December to the third 
week of January. And then he said he was 
interested. And then, again, we hadn™t touche
d each other; we ha
dn™t even kissed on the 
cheek. He had sat by my bed and we had discoursed for a long time in the evening, and 
what happened and what is what I deeply be
lieve in Œ I don™t know that my  children do, 
but, but that™s their lives Œ I believe that 
to ma rry some body you have to have the same 
political opinions, if not religi
ous opinions. We  were both at 
ease, and both left Œ not too 
far left, but for the poor. Okay?  You have tw
o things in common, you have it ma de. With 
Toulet (ph), he was Catholic, practicing Catholic
 and far right. As we said to each other, 
ﬁ We don™t need to go out for election, we stay
 homeﬂ and we would cancel each other. 
We cannot ma rry and make it, and ma ke a 
60-year commitment, as I with John, with 
some body who destroys your vote when you go to 
the voting booth. So th
at counted a lot. 
We were really very close, so I said, 
ﬁNo, I am not going to touch, ma rriage-wise, 
anybody in uniform.ﬂ I had seen the French 
uniform, the English uniform, the German 
uniform, the  American uniform. ﬁ You go back home  and come  back dressed properly.ﬂ 

So, he went back to wherever it was in the 
States, got demobilized, got into his uniform 
and then he came back. Then he came  back
 and he rang the bell. And my mother, who 
had cried Œ Oh, he sent to me  from– He came back by boat; at the 
time  we didn™t have 
the planes Œ So, he sent me  a te
legram and said, ﬁReserve the 14
th
. Signed, the Huronﬂ 
which is the critical term th
at Voltaire has for guys from 
the Pampa. And he came back– 
Oh, do my dates ma ke sense? He left in Decem
ber, we wrote to each other, he came back 
on the 13
th
 of July and the 13
th
 in the evening we were then engaged. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
85 
 
 
 
Q: You mean in January he came back? 

 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: Oh, he came  back months later? 

 

A: He comes– he came back– 

 

Q: Six months later. 

 

A: Six months later it took him ti me to get– 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Not only out of unifor m, to get a job. So, he 
got a job at the same  
hotel where they– that 
had been occupied with the Germans, was then occupied by the Americans and he got a 

job as an assi stant to the Brigadier General, 
whatever, in charge of American things in 
Paris. And then he had a job and then the 
day he was back, we had got engaged. I never 

believed in waiting. As I said, th
ere is an element of luck, an
d also, don™t let it pass by Œ 
grab it. So we did. And the 13
th
 or the 14
th
 we were engaged. And when we were ma rried, 
the French did not like at all officially th
e idea that a French woman would marry an 
American, not done. So they had us wait a
nd the first date we could get was in 
September, so we were married in September ™45. 
 

Q: It™s an amazing story.  
 
A: Isit? 

 

Q: Yes, I think so. You hardly know this person! You spent– 

 

A: I knew the essential. 

 

Q: Clearly. That was– you–  

 

A: Okay, you had the physical 
attraction. I found him handsome– He was ma king hi mself 
available. He  was very interested. And we had the same  opinion: no God. And the same  

democratic of the left  political  view
 and what there is
 to, so jump in. 
 

Q: And he seemed a sweet person...and a generous person. 

 

A: And also, also very kind, yes. 

 

Q: Yes, so your mother liked him?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
86 
 
 
A: Oh, my mother when he called back, no she 
was de-–devastated at 
the idea that he was 
an American. It™s 3,000 or 6,000 miles away, 
her daughter, her only daughter. She had 
lived with us, you know. We  were extremely cl
ose. So, when he called, she had opened Œ 
she was completely without d
ecency of fear. She had opened the telegram and I had read 
it right around, so obviously she knew he was co
mi ng back. But when he called to ask for 
the appointme nt, she said, ﬁOh, what a surpri
se!ﬂ And he laughed because he knew she 
was laughing– er, she was lying. But she kne
w I was going to be happy and it was nice, 
it was important for her. She had had such a 
terrible– Oh, at first she would say, ﬁOh,ﬂ 
she would say, ﬁit™s only one month.ﬂ Then 
she would say, ﬁOh, it™s only three months.ﬂ 
Then after that she stopped saying, ﬁIt™s onl
y–ﬂ She knew it was going to work out. And 
then she became  very fond of hi m, yes. A
nd when she died... she wanted him to, I me an, 
later on in life  when she wasn™t feeling well at
 all, she was as much interested in having 
him come  back to see her as she was in me  coming. 
 

Q: That™sni ce. 

 

A: Yeah, he was a good Œ and he still is Œ a 
good fellow, yeah. It™s not
 easy to live 60 years 
together. Mostly tail years, tail end years. 
 

Q: What is Œ what was that, when? 

 

A: The tail end years. 

 

Q: The tail end are difficult. 

 

A: Are not that easy– part of
 the game. So, it™s a life. 
 

Q: What language did you have between you, French? 

 

A: I never know. 

 

Q: [Laughs] 

 

A: I– Don™t ask me , because some times it™s English and some times it™s French. He would 
say that it is more French because it flatte
rs him. But I think it™s mostly English.  
 

Q: Did you, did you speak English? 

 

A: Not a word. 

 

Q: When you me t, not a word? 

 

A: No, but I read fluently. With my 
ba ckground– The French background of school, 
schooling wa s very bizarre. You studied langu
age but not a word of spoken language, all 
literature. So I knew the gramma r. I knew the l
iterature very well. And I reme mber that I 
expressed myself with a great difficulty. I pr
actically di dn™t speak a 
word of English. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
87 
 
 
when you have the gramma r the vocabulary a
nd what else? And it come s. Three mo nths 
in the country and you speak fluently. 
 
Q: But when you me t in France–? 

 

A: Then he spoke French. 

 

Q: He spoke– and he was fluent 
in French, clearly– Sort of. 
 

A: Yeah, I me a n he has– as our children say, 
ﬁBoth our parents have 
an accent.ﬂ I have  an 
accent and he  has an accent in Fr
ench. They don™t; they are fluent. 
 

Q: They are fluent. When did you work for UNRRA in Paris? 

 

A: UNR RA?  UNRR A is after the war. 

 

Q: Right?  Is that, was that between the time
 you meet John and you ge
t ma rried or after? 

 

A: UNRRA sent some thing to me , I didn™t work for UNRRA.  

 

Q: Youdidn™t? 

 

A: People in my fa mily did, but I didn™t, not that I reme mber. Which is it™s very– Wh at 
does it spell out? United– 
 

Q: That you were visiting survivors in hospita
ls?  Maybe, ma ybe only, th
at you only did that 
in Switzer land? 
 

A: Only in Switzerland. 

 

Q: Only in Switzerland? 
 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

 

Q: So then, in between the time  you meet John and he come s back, are you working?  
You™ve come back from Switzerland– 
 

A: I probably wa s teaching. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. So you went back to teaching?  And when he came and you got ma rried, where 
were you living? 
 

A: 187 Boulevard St-Michel, above the Écoledes Mines, above the Luxembourg Garden. 
We wer e  t h e– 
 

Q: So it™s near where, wh
ere your mother was living? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
88 
 
 
 
A: No, no, no, no, no. We  some times lived with her 
at first, but as soon as we  could, we got 
our own apartment. 
 

Q: So where was she living now? The ol d apartment? 

 

A: Mymother? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: During– She was still living 
in the old apartme nt. During the time when we lived in 
Boulevard St -Michel she was visiting us 
for dinner or– but keeping us– I mean, we 
were very private; we didn™t live with her. 
 

Q: Yeah, but when you were growing 
up, you were living near Luxembour g– 
 

A: Up ‚til 12 years of age, then at Vaugirard and that™s where I wa s caught by the Germans 
with my mother. 
 

Q: Okay. So how long– You are in Paris with
 John until 1948? For two years? Three years?  
 

A: Mm-hmm. Yes, and then we came back in ™48. 

 

Q: And was it good living in Paris?  I me an, your 
mother must have been very happy that you 
were there. 
 
A: I guess! We  were living in Boulevard St-M
ichel, we had a ma id, I had all my friends. 
Yes, it was great. It wa
s diffi cult to let go– 
 
Q: To leave! Yeah, I would think– 
 
A: Yeah, it was a great sacrifice. Mostly, 
when you consider my culture, my background, 
that was huge. But you don™t realize it untilafterwards. I don™t th
ink anybody would do it 
now. Not with my background. I offered for him 
to stay there and work there and find a 
job, but he didn™t want to.  
 

Q: He didn™t wa nt to? 

 

A: No, he should have, but that™s after the fact. 

 

Q: Andwh-– 

 

A: He had no studies finished. I had earned 
my degree already, I was already teaching. He 
was just a student studying at University of
 Chicago. He had– He wanted to enter law 
school and he wanted to go to Chicago La
w School. So, happily, I have enough degrees 
and good records that immediately I ke
pt ________, so I went with him. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
89 
 
 
 
Q: So you left and– 

 

A: But Chicago, I tell you, when we are in Ch
icago, he had made  a mi stake and he drove 
through a slum area, and to come  fr om Pari
s and think you are going 
to live your life– It 
was a mi stake, but it was still overwhelming.  
 

Q: He– You– so he drove you through it? 

 

A: No, it was a mi stake. He took the wrong 
turn. We lived by the university, which isn™t 
that– 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: –glorious. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: But at least it was an apartment, you know
, a graduate student apartment, which was 
decent. Although the neighborhood isn™t very great.
 But it™s mostly nowadays. It was all 
right back then. But those slums--fromChicago, I don™t know if you know them. The y 

are, they are worse than Harlem by a long–

Q: Okay. Wa s your mother very upset when 
you decided that you were going Œ both going Œ 
to leave Paris? 
 

A: Of course, she must have been. But she 
was enough of a good mother
 to realize that by 
that time, we had been deeply ma rried, and 
we were really kicking, so that was more 
meaningful for her. Also, his mother came 
to visit, and although again there was a 
complete barrier of language, they li
ked each othe r, and she liked how, you know, 
learned and sedate the mother was. Sort of 
give her the idea of the stability that she 
absolutely had not had in her love life.  
 

Q: So you, you ended up having some thing that
 she wished she had had, but she never 
wanted to destroy it? 
 

A: Oh, no she would not. 

 

Q: She did not– 

 

A: She would not interfere. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: And it™s extraordinary because she wa s 
completely– she didn™t know the word of 
discretion. You know, when, when we lived toge
ther, there was that ma ster bedroom that 
was the end of a long hall Œ they are specia
list of long halls. That™s the only places where 
they put theirs clothes is in
 the long halls. And then, then 
the bath, she would barge in 
any time, never thought of it. Don™t forget, sh
e had been without a 
ma n for all her life. 
She did not know what ma rried life meant. 
Or, either she was nosy, or she was very 
indiscreet. Both of them, true. 
 

Q: So, you come to Chicago and you– John goe
s to law school. Am I correct?  Or he 
finishes his B.A.– 
 

A: Goes to law school and I am accepted for a– with a teaching fellowship for a doctorate 
in Ancient Greek. 
 

Q: AncientGreek. 

 

A: And we live in a graduate student apartmen
t. Wh ich is not bad. A
nd I learned to cook. 
 

Q: You finally get into a kitchen? 

 

A: I have to. John was in charge Œ we shared 
always, to this day, we
 do share Œ so, at the 
time, he was in charge of the dishes and 
I was in charge of the cooking. And now, I™m 
trying to ma ke him in charge of the cooki
ng. ‚Cause I think it™s, I think it™s more 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
91 
 
 
constructive for old age. It™s more stimulati
ng for him. I take over the cleaning up and the 
dishes, which is not much fun. 
 
Q: Was this the fi rst time you were in a kitchen? 

 

A: Where, in Chicago?  

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Probably. I didn™t ma ke a huge point of it but
 I have Œ I have pictures Œ I mi ght send you 
one, where it is obviously he in the kitchen and not I. 
 

Q: Did you like being in the kitchen? Did you like cooking? 

 

A: I had a gift. 

 

Q: You had a gift? 

 

A: My mother, grandmother was a good cook, I 
told you my mot her was a good cook and I 
turned out to be a good cook. I, yes, I like it becau
se I like to entertain. So to this day, we 
have friends and I cook. And all the fr iends 
know that I am a good cook, so it™s a pleasure 
to come . Good conversation and good food, so– 
 

Q: It can™t be better. 

 

A: It™sallright. 
 
Q: And why Ancient Greek? 

 

A: It was the field I was the least proficient i
n. And when I came  here I was so proficient in 
French and in Latin that it would have b
een ridiculous for me  to– And I am glad 
because it™s a one-on-one Œ at that level, it™s
 a one-on-one relationshi p for the PhD. So, it 
would have been devastating to have a rela
tionship Œ and they we
re– I didn™t like them 
very much. And they– the litt
le bit of the relationship I 
had, they already were very 
resentful that I was so superior. I mean, you th
ink of it, I had had fourteen years of Greek 
by the time  I reached Chicago. 
 

Q: Fourteen? 

 

A: Fourteen, because you start in 
quatorzième, quinzième, seizième
, 
philosophie 
and then I 
went through all the competitive... 
 

Q: So, you™re saying that the ot
her students were resentful? 

 

A: Yes, and the teachers also. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
92 
 
 
Q: Theteachers. 
 

A: I didn™t get along at all well. You know, I ha
d to have special Œ for a PhD, you have to 
have, whatever you call it, in each field. You ha
ve to have an exam and the French pe rson 
didn™t like it, didn™t like me, I felt. It was very
 difficult to teach me . What is he going to 
teach me? I reme mber, I showed some authors 
and he– he wasn™t interested in them. I 
wasn™t the run-of-the-mill student that he wa
s expecting. But Œ and those were the rough 
years. The weather was– Talk about yester
day, you know. That plus wa s the day in and 
day out. 
 

Q: Cold, very cold. 

 

A: Oh, biting cold and we, we had to cross 
the Midway. And I told you, that™s one thing I 
don™t like is cold. And you could not 
escape it without a car in Chicago.  
 

Q: So, Chicago was much colder, even t
hough it was extremely uncomfortable during the 
war. It was not this cold, or was it? 
 

A: Paris, [laughs] when they say they have acold wave, it™s a joke. 
I told you, there is one 
inch of snow and the Luxembourg will close its 
gates. And they take pi ctures of all the 
museums wi th the little st atue 
with a crummy little inch on the 
shoulders of the statue and 
they have a snowstorm. No, so even in the de
pt h of it, Paris is liv
able. Chicago was, was 
really biting cold. 
 

Q: Were there– I™m assumi ng there were ve
ry few wome n PhD students in 1948, even in 
Chicago. You must have been not only a supe
rior student in Anci
ent Greek, but there 
weren™t, wome n were not going and getting– 
a lot of people weren™t going and getting 
PhDs. But certainly not women, 
so you must have been–? 
 

A: I was, we were isolate
d. We were very self-suffici
ent and busy studying and I have 
pictures in that student apartment where I wi
th my great dictionaries and John with his 
law studies. We were happy and self-sufficien
t. I, I don™t– I had some –they had some 

war– He had a G.I. Bill. We  lived on that G.I. Bill. And he ha d some fr iends in law 

school who lived in war– it was sort of hut
s in the mi ddle of Midway. And we thought it 
was paradise that they had a place. You know, 
we, we had not really, in the States, a real 
apartment of our own. But it never wa s a probl
em for me  not having muc h to live on, as 
long as I had the books and studies and John.  
 

Q: How long did it take you to get a PhD? 

 

A: I never finished it. By that time , I wa s cl
osing in and starting ha
ving to write a thesis 
since I passed all the exams, and I ha d to pa
ss one in French, which I remember ‚cause 

John said it was a big joke ‚cause it took me  
a long time. He didn™t realize it was a test on 
my English, not just my French. Dr. Smith took 
off and I wa s left in the lurch, and at that 
point, I said, ﬁLook, who needs it?  I have a cer
tificate of proficiency in all the fields–ﬂ 
even in German Œ that™s when I studied Germ
an. And if I had time, that™s what I would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
93 
 
 
study. I™m fascinated by deepening the Germ
an language. I had to study German for the 
PhD in Greek because ma ny of the learned 
books on Ancient Greeks are in German. So, I 
passed the Ge rman proficiency exam; it wa
s a written exam not a spoken one. Oh, I 
reme mber going to a course and there was a guy teaching the course. And I was 
distraught at the idea of comi ng from the wa
r, having to study German, and he began to 
say some thing in Germa n to the class and I ut
terly disliked it. And he sensed it and he 
called me  after class and he said, ﬁDon™t 
you feel that way. I am a Jew. So, you don™t 
have to be so frightened of me .ﬂ But I wa
s delighted that I had only to write, to know 
how to read. And I love the literature. And 
I love the literature– I have to find those 
books. Anybody that can find those books for me  
is my love. There was a series of books, 
nine in number, which are extremely well done 
by cognates. You, you have to realize that 
75 percent of all of the languages have comm
on Greek and La tin roots. So, you start with 
the literature; it™s a
ll written in German. And you read th
e nine little books and at the end, 
you are reading German. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: And there is no gramma r  at all; nine little
 books and no gramma r. You ha ve the same  in 
French. I think I have the French series. And 
it™s a very clever way of doing it ‚cause you 
get yourself into it without noticing it. Then 
you™ll be able to read it. So I read it. 
 

Q: Your professor left University of Chicago and they had no repl acement. 

 

A: No, no replacement. She was taking a break, 
but it was really
 not a moral thing to do. She 
shouldn™t have in the mi ddle 
of the year then that– 
 
Q: Right and with only one, one PhD student. 
 

A: [Laughs] Well, that™s probably why she took th
e pretext that there wasn™t much for her to 
stay. So, I didn™t mi ss it, you know; I always 
went by without–All Œ 
It™s called All But 
the Thesis– 
 

Q: A.B.D.  

 

A: A.B.D.,whatever. 

 

Q: And you, did you stay in Chicago or you move d elsewhere?  Did you mo ve east or west? 

 

A: I always found a jobs and we moved with my jobs.  

 

Q: Really? 

 

A: So I wrote and found and we moved wherever
 I found. And I wrote to
 the University of 
Maryland and hop! they jumped at me. So I 
began teaching at Maryland and we came to 
the area, and that™s the wa y we started. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
94 
 
 
Q: And did you love teaching? 
 

A: Not at Maryland. I don™t know if I dare say 
that. The Œ their stude
nt body was very poor. 
And the faculty wasn™t much higher. Johns
 Hopkins was Œ I taught at Johns Hopkins 
School of Advanced Studies Œ that wa s inte
resting Œ on Massachusetts Avenue. American 
U. wasn™t very interesting either; the teachers 
were better but the student s were still very 
me diocre. There isn™t really– It is not really 
an area of great univers
ities. It™s not very 
stimulating. But, by that time, I was teachi
ng also in the dayt ime. Those were only 
evening jobs, I told you, because by that time  
we supported both my mother and aunt  in 

their retirement. Thei
r retirement from governme nt was ve
ry pitiful so we supplemented 
it. And I was teaching during the daytime at
 Mount Vernon College and I Œ The Greek 
died, the Latin died, the French 
at that time  began to die off.
 And they said, ﬁ What are we 
going to do with you? ﬂ  I said, ﬁThere is one
 thing you don™t have.ﬂ It was ™63. ﬁIt™s a 
program of Continuing Education.ﬂ And I ope
ned in the area the first program of 
Continuing Education for Œ I called that fo
r wome n and me n. And now
 the whole college 
is living out of its programs for women. But it, there was no program for wome n at the 

time. 
 

Q: Then how did you come  to that?  That
 was a very new idea at that time . 
 

A: Because I wa s going to lose my job. 
ﬁHow did you come  to that? ﬂ  [Laughs] 
 

Q: [Laughs] 

 

A: That is a ve ry good incentive. I still have 
the first program. I ma de it, pasted it by hand. 
And I was very imaginative. I started, I had 
started with non-credit courses and I had the 
most imaginative program in the city. I ha
d a friend of John, and he was a builder, you 
know, he had built hi s own house. So, I had a co
urse. And I had another one, he was very 
good with tinkering with car, a course in auto-m
e c hanics. I had a cour
se in home  repairs 
at the time when, on Foxhall Road, you had, you 
had people flocking for the home repair. 
And people flocking for the car repair cour
se. And I had, you know, the bet-– and I paid 
them very highly as I had been highly paid in France and they enjoyed it. It became 

humongously successful. 
 

Q: It was very smart. 

 

A: It was a clever idea and I enjoyed it and they enjoyed it. 

 

Q: And when did you have your children? 

 

A: I placed them. I mi ssed, I mi ssed the summer 
mo nths in both cases. I was a teacher, so 
three months, that was perfect. Missed both cas
es and I hit on Christma s. So, I had two 
Christma s vacations and I had Silvia. My daughter was born on the 21
st
 of December, and 
I went back to school on the fourth. I never 
mi ssed a beat. I went to
 the hospital Œ I was 
so pregnant you could have pus
hed me  I would have rolleddown the hill Œ and I had her 
without pain. I mean, the child
ren were the least problem of
 my life. And when I had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
95 
 
 
Olivier, the first one, in Pari
s, I was in the delivery room and John was outside and he 
heard the baby cry, and he stopped the nurse an
d said, ﬁThat was, there, there, what™s 
that?ﬂ and she said, ﬁYou must be teasing me
. She™s been there for 15 minutes.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁWas there, is there another baby there?ﬂ Sh
e sa id, ﬁNo, I checked and it was–ﬂ Fifteen 
mi nutes for one and no pain for the other. I had 
lost the first one. The first one of them all 
was– lost at birth. It was an abnormal 
child, and it was devastating. That was ™47, 
devastating to have an abnor
ma l child. It couldn™t be– it couldn™t be salvaged. It was a 
spina bifida
. And they said now that the war depr
ivation, finally it got to me. It was a 
lack of certain nutrients in my body, that I co
uld not produce a child with a growth spine. 
 

Q: Uh-huh.Wo w! 

 

A: That was difficult, but– 

 

Q: I can imagine. 

 

A: But we didn™t mi ss a beat after that. I waite
d because we had study years, and I couldn™t Œ 
I had to wait for five years Œ but then we did it after that. 
 

Q: But 15 mi nutes for each. 

 

A: Second, for the second. 

 

Q: Still, even so. That™s re ally– 

 

A: And no pain for Silvia. They would put in 
my room the other wome n to, to see what it 
was like to have a child wit
hout– thinking it was anything. 
 

Q: And who took care of th
e child, your children?   
 

A: I had a ma id, a black woma n who wa s de
votion– I had checked among my friends. And 
I checked and we once visited 
a friend. She had a nursema id, an old ma id that took care 
of the children, and when the ma id left, the ch
ildren had a tantrum and wanted to go with 
the ma id. I said, [kisses her finger] ﬁThis is
 the one for me .ﬂ Never mi nd the degree of 
whatever the– That™s the recommendation and 
I had that one and she– we lived I don™t 
know where and at 7:30, I left the chil
dren knowing the she would be there.  
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: And she was there until– I have pictures of
 her with Silvia. She wa
s there for years, and 
I had my mo ther-in-law living with us. But sh
e never lifted a finger, so it was Annie Mae 
who took care of the children. 
 

Q: I have two questions to ask you. You™re born 
of a Jewish mot her and a Catholic father. I 
understand that you™re an atheist. Do you 
have Œ if some one asks you what your 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474  
96 
 
 
background is Œ do you say you™re Ca tholic, 
do you say you™re Jewish, or do you say 
you™re nothing?   
 
A: I say nothing. 

 

Q: Nothing? 

 

A: Because it™s truly, it is nothing. I cannot 
claim anything else. I w
ould lie to say I was 
raised a Catholic because I really– It was 
built on a false paper that I got when I was 21. 
And Jewish, I– If you asked me  where is a 
synagogue in Paris, I have no idea and no 
curiosity. But if my children had ma rried a Jew,
 I would have been perfectly satisfied. I 
don™t even know what they ma rried. They ma
rried some body who claims to be a Catholic 
but... And the other one ma rried 
somebody interesting in that hi
s father Œ she, she delved 
into pastor™s sons, she loved pastor™s s
ons, I don™t know why. She ma rried the son of a 
pastor and her mother-in-law, the wife  of a pastor, never set foot in
 the church, not even 
for the baptism of the children di
d she set foot in the church. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: But I never ask what she be
lieves or not but her husband is
 a pastor. A delight, a very 
nice guy. My son is divorced, but I rema in frie
ndly with his ex, who™s the mother of my 
grandchildren. Also, I have an extremely 
bizarre trait, once I have loved some body, I 
can™t stop. I mean, you c a nnot pull the plug and 
say, ﬁI am going to the next chapter of 
my life. You drop this one, and I™m
 going to be in love with–ﬂ  
 

Q: So, you have ma ny loves in your life. 
 
A: I have ma ny people that I have loved for 
a long time  and I hold on to them Œ not in a 
possessive  way, because  it™s so far away Œ but 
they are st ill meaningful. I am not a person 
with different chapters and 
close doors. I don™t close doors. 
 

Q: Does that come  from your fa mily you think? 

 

A: Hmm?  

 

Q: Does that come  from your fa m
ily? Is this how 
your fa mily is? 
 

A :  N o ,  r e me mb e r ,  my  mo t h e r – 

 

Q: But your mo ther was forced to 
close a chapter in certain ways. 
 

A: Yeah, my fa ther™s family– He left– I don™
t know. It™s probably genetic, but I have no 
idea where it comes from. 
 

Q: You never me t your father. You me t the daughter, you me t Jeannette. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0474

A: I tried to meet– It™s a big loss in my life. 
At the end of the war, in ™47, you had the right 
to ask the Red Cross about anybody around the 
world, and they would contact that person 
and give you news and I asked about Pierre 
Denier. I hadn™t hear
d about him since–™40. 
I know in ™40, I was 18; when I was 18, he ma
rried somebody my age. And he must have 
been an interesting character and I wanted to
 see him. And I  was told that he was dead. 
And that was a big shock, I reme mb er. And they
 said he died of lung cancer. And I had 
never, never even heard talk, anybody talk 
about the fellow, so I asked my mother, 
ﬁPierre Denierﬂ Œ I ne ver called him father, 
I always called him Pierre Denier if I 
me ntioned him to anybody Œ ﬁPierre Denier, wa
s he a smoker? ﬂ She said, ﬁThree packs a 
day,ﬂ but I knew nothing about him. 
 
Q: Did Jeannette help you to get–? 

 

A: Hmm?  

 

Q: Did his daughter that
 you me t, your sister– 
 

A: YoumeanJeannette? 

 

Q: Yes, Jeannette, did she give yousome  sense of what he was like? 

 

A: It™s interesting. It™s interesting because I wa
s very interested in what he was like. And if 
you follow– If I follow the schedule, he ma rried Œ he had ma ny mi stresses and then he 

ma rried Jeannette™s mother, who is a delight, loved me , I me an, we wrote the letters and 

it was very funny. And Jeannette said that Pi
erre Denier died when she was 10 months 
old. And so we had one picture of Pierre Deni
er with Michelle as 
a baby on his shoulder, 
but he was at a casino Œ it was because  of the game and the wome n that he was there. 

And she ma de the comme nt Œ you asked the 
question Œ she ma de the comment, ﬁDo you 
realize that, out of the three 
of us, Michelle is the only one
 who had had her picture with 
her father?ﬂ He really
 is a character.  
 

Q: So, there is a pi
ctur e of Michelle? 

 

A: But if you go to– if you go to, to Re si
stencia ___________ in Arge
ntina there is a 
museum named after him, he became a big sc
ientist. He suddenly blossomed when he 
was there. And it™s funny because I knew
 several divorced me n who ended up in 
Argentina it was the wild 
pampa
.  
 

Q: For Nazis and for refugees. 

 

A: Maybe that, I mean, ma ny people took ref
uge in the last frontier, and it is an 
extraordinary and huge country. He felt free, ma ybe.  
 

Q: Let me  ask you one last question. I think it™s
 the last question. D
o, do you think that it– 
that there are– that there™
s some  effect of having been through the war and your 
experiences on you.

A: That there is some effect? 

 

Q: Effect on you from the war, that you, th
at you can piece toge ther. Did it change you in 
some  way, did it–? Or is it simply this 
is just part of what you went through? 
 

A: You know what came to my mi nd?  What came 
t o my mi nd is that it probably enriched 
my life. To have thrown at you so many experi
ences that call for a reaction, it gets things 
out of you that probably would rema in dorma
nt and unused if not for the catastrophe. 
Does it ma ke any sense? 
 

Q: Yes, it does. Is there anything you™d 
like to say that you haven™t me ntioned? 
 

A: [Shakes head] No, I think I am talked out. 

 

Q: You think you™re talked out?  
We ll, I can™t thank you enough for– 
 

A: I hope you get some thing out of it. 

 

Q: I, I did. And I™m sure other people will. 
And I™m really gr ateful
. You™re a wonderful 
storyteller and you have 
a great story to tell. 
 

[Picture of Nicole as
 a young woman is shown] 

 

Q: What™sthis? 

 
A: This is a picture of Nicole looking out of
 the window. I was 11 or 12 years old. My hair 
looks very nice but it™s a fake. I pretended that
 my hair was naturally
 curly; it wasn™t. The 
ma id rolled it up with an iron, a curling iron 
every morning in the kitchen and that™s why 
it is this way. 
 
[Another picture of Nicole is shown] 

 

Q: And this one? 

 

A: This one I cannot date. I must have been 22 
or 23. It™s taken in a studio. But it had to do 
with, as I said, installing of the phone, and the–
 it was a ma rketing ploy that they invited 
you to have your picture taken in
 the studio right afterwards.
