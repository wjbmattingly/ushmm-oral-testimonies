37
A2: I™m Œ I™m coming to it, but you™re spo
iling it. You™re spoiling the whole story. 
When we came in the hotel, 
okay, then was the customs also, you have to give a 
passport. And when  you leave Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A2: Œ they give it back to you. 

Q: Yeah. 

A2: Okay. I didn™t remember what™s wr
itten in the passport. And again, as 
Moshe
 
mentioned to you, he was th
e chief cantor of the city, and Œ and our passport was 
written all in French. So in French his title Œ  

A: I was city cantor. 
A2: Yes, you said that already 
Mo sh e
. It was written, where they say the title, 
prime minister of 
[indecipherable]
. This was his title. In French it me Œ you know, 
in 
Euro pe
, a cantor and a rabbi is
 a minister, like in 
England
, you know, so he was 
a minister premier, chief minister. 

Q: Oh, the chief minister. 
A2: Yeah. But seeing the chief minister, an Is
raeli passp ort, so if they s Œ so that 
man at the Œ at the desk, wh en he opene
d th e passport, he called right away th e 
manager, said look, the Prime Minister of 
Israel
 is here. Yeah. Well, I didn™t know 
that.

Q: You didn™t know that either.  
A2: No, no, we didn™t Œ we didn™t see 
[indecipherable]
 no, it didn™t occur to us Œ 
Q: That™s very cool. I like that story. 
A2: Yeah, well, so the three men start 
speaking, of course
, in French, they 
apologize. They  apologize, they apologize,
 apologize, and we didn™t know. If we 
would have known, this go
vernment would have made a welcome party. We would 
invited th e press, and Œ and we would have
 put the Œ and I am kvelling, you know, I 
think Œ thinking well he™s Œ he™s fame Œ I 
mean, I didn™t even kn
ow where we are, I 
didn™t even know if there are Jews there,
 so how do they  know who ca Œ came Œ the 
famous Cantor 
Kraus
 is? But then they said, if we
 would know he is coming, we 
would have put the flag out. Wait a second,
 flag? What™s going on here? I Œ I really 
wasn™t that stupid, it was a semi-misunders
tanding Œ misunderstanding. So  Œ but to 
make sure, I said wait, and I called my 
[indecipherable]
 my French was, but not 
perfect, I said, I™m not unde
rstanding well, you know? So 
I Œ I went to next door, 
called my  friends, and I hope they™re not u
ndressed yet, yeah, and I asked them, see 
what™s happening. So this 
is what the story was, they
 thought he is the prime 
minister of 
Israel
, and they wanted  to Œ 
to  Œ di-di-di Œ anyhow Œ 
Q: Should have said he™s be
tter th an the prime minister.

say goodbye, you know. Needless to say, we 
left, I don™t know, five in the morning, 
we ran away, you know, because
 we didn™t want to Œ to 
tell them that they™re Œ and 
you know, for I think weeks, 
we checked every Israeli pa
ssport, to read Œ Israeli 
newspaper, sorry, to see if the 
Shin Bet 
is not looking for im
poster, prime minister 
imposter. Because they don™t know the story, and if the 
[indeciphera ble]
 there was 
a prime minister 
Q: That™s great. It™s a very good story. 
A2: I think it™s a very funny story.

 Shabbat, we want to pay. And they  
send us to a family, we
 stayed there. But Œ 
A: An Israeli fellow.

that time, when

Isr ael
, we have to stop in Œ in 
Teheran
. 
Q: Okay . 

A2: Because the Œ 
El Al 
couldn™t fly over 
Africa
 then. So we Œ they flew through 
Teheran
. So we were there three days. 
Q: It™s ironic today to  think that you couldn™t go to

, for Israelis. 
A2: Yeah, to ir Œ yeah, yeah, yeah. Well Œ 

Q: The world has changed. 
A: And I was rece Œ and I was received by the shah.

abbat, we went to shul. There were the 
Ashkenazi shul, where all the 
mishulachim
(ph), all the Israelis doubled, and a few 
Ashkenazim, because 
mostly they had Sephardic s
hul, and the service guest. So 
they ask him Œ they gave him Haft
orah. They didn™t always. Said 
Moshe 
Shapeer
(ph). Yeah, I said, he™s a diamond merchant from 
Johannesburg
, this is 
what he said. Because we
 knew, once they hear 
[indecipherable]
 sing so mething 
for us 
[indecipherable]
 because you know. So, this 
is how we Œ the way how we

avoided it. So, but when he Œ 
when he said Haftorah, they 
saw in the Haftorah that™s 
Œ that™s unusual. His diction, first of all,
 is perfect, and his voice, even not singing, 
but reciting Œ so they looked at him. And 
I was Œ like this is what they wou Œ the 
ladies™ shul, I was standing 
in the door, because I wanted
 to see and hear, and I was 
the only lady there. So I hear two men 
walking up and down, walking up, down. 
And they ™re looking at Œ look at him, and 
I hear one says to the other, are you sure 
this is 
Moshe Shapeer
(ph)? Because I could swear this is 
Moshe Kraus
. I know 

h i m fro m t h e army . Th is was a st o r y  in  
Istanbul
 that Œ 
Q: In 
Teheran
. 
A2: Œ in 
Teheran
,
 Teheran
. Wait. Then, when we walk
ed out the shul, we went 
out, we see thousands of people in the st
reet. By the way, don™t know if it™s 
interesting, but then in ™62,
 all the sewage in te Œ in 
Teheran
 were open. It was Œ 
the main st Œ is it no? It was open. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 was th ere.  
A2: Of course, I got sick, by
 the way. But this Œ I™m 
not going to tell this. I sit 
[indecipherable]
 waiting in the street, so we ask, 
what™s happening? They told us 
that then was 
Brezhnev 
the secretary of 
Russia

ate visit. And th e shah, an-and 
Fra

 Diva
(ph) 
went to the airport to welcome him, and th
ey will come by Œ back
 this way. So is 
this where the people stood. So we said we
 will wait, we™ll see. And then we really 
saw. We saw beautiful golden carriage, w
ith horses, you know. We saw the shah 
and Mr. 
Brezhnev
. And you know, the shah was dressed beau tiful 
[indecipherable] 
with a suit and Œ and then
 the second carriage was 
Fra
(ph) 
Diva
(ph) and Mrs. 
Brezhnev
. Well, 
Fra
(ph) 
Diva
(ph) was as if she just walked out 
from 
Dior
. She was beautiful, young 
and beau tiful. And Mrs. 
Brezhnev
, she looked 
as if she just came out from the 
corhose
(ph). Honestly, with 
the duke an-and of 
course of as Œ this 
[indecipherable]
. So this is when we sa
w the shah, yeah. So this 
is 
Teheran

A: Very interesting story. But not 
more interesting 
than my  story. 
A2: Yeah . Okay , what else? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 terribly disturbing, you see,
 this is the difference. 
A2: And then in ™64 was a very ebag Œ a bi

songs, to sing for the Jews about

A2: No. It was an historic event, the firs

to sing for the Jews 
in 
Russia

invited. The Russian
 invited the press 
because they wanted to show

. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Moshe Kraus 
November 30, 2014 

 

 
 
79
A: But they said 
Moshe Kraus
 is more interesting because 
Koussevit zky
 sang only 
hazzonahs
(ph). I sang 
hazzo nahs
(ph), Yiddish, Hebrew, 
hasidis
(ph). I had four 
programs. So I gave two hours,
 but they were not boring.

hours. It was a little to o long. It was a Œ 
A2: And a Œ and another thing Œ 
A: Œ a-after Œ then in the 
second hour, people wanted 
to  Œ already that he shall 
finish. 

A2: And another thing. I don™t know if 
Moshe
 mentioned that he was the chief 
cantor of the Israeli army. Did 
he mention that? So as a Œ 
as an officer of the army, 
he was a, you know, bigger dr
aw  than a canto r from the 
States
, all right? Okay, so 
this is one story. 
A: Because 
Goldman
 wanted to  send
 Koussevitzky
. 
Q: Yeah.

A2: Yes, you™re right, you™re right, 
sorry. Anyhow, from Œ fro

From 
Vienna
 we went to 
Prague
. In  
Prague
 we have a few stories, a few stories. 
The first one, we stayed in a hotel, and 
there was no western pe

people who stayed in this 
hotel was so dark from Œ from iddel Œ Middle East Arabs, 
I don™t know, a-and Ru ssians. And we were the only ones 
[indecipherable]
 of 
course, Israeli passport. So one day, the de
sk calls us and they
 said, there™s a man 
come to see you. We didn™t know it Œ who 
it is. To make the story short, there was a 
man in Œ in Œ his name is

time a local person couldn™t come into hote
l, the hotel was only for international 
visitors. You couldn™t walk in. And if yo
u walked in, you had to leave his passport 
at the desk, and they  had to chec
k what it is, and report to the

then he came to see Œ  then he is allowed 
to come and see us. And of course that was 
emotional to Œ 
Moshe
 didn™t reme mb er Œ you reme mb ered him? You did 
reme mb er? Anyhow Œ okay. And th en he 
tells us a story like this, which is 
unbelievable story. He says he is marri

daughter and twin Œ twin girls. And he re
mained a Jew. He was also in the camp 
and survived, but he is still a 
Jew, in heart. And he knowsthat if he™ll stay with the 
chil Œ with the family in Œ in 
Prague
, they will lose the ch
ildren. They™ll become 
goyim. They will intermarry
, because the Jewish life wa
sn™t as interested Œ as 
organized. I don™t know if they had the chie

have a chief rabbi. And Œ and th eir son is

all I want. Can you believe? 
Q: Wow. 

A2: I mean, if Œ really, I mean, I Œ  we

hing at the mo ment. I™ll tra Œ 
I™ll see what I can do, and we™ll see. And

A: Right, you Œ you are the boss. 
A2: Œ no Œ yeah Œ no, I wo

st tell the sh-short. So 
Mo sh e
 left, 
and I remained in pra Œ in 
Prague
 alone. It was very unpleasant, it Œ to be in the 
hotel, it was all those Arabs, a woman alone, 
and they  looked  at me all the time, you 
know. This is not important. But this Mr. 
Singer
, he was my  connection. He is the 
only one I knew. And as it happened, it Œ is
h Œ sho Œ told  me where to go, to  the 
opera, and the ballet and all that. So then
, we had an  agreement, he didn™t know 
how long he™ll be in Œ in 
B u ch a r est
, so Œ and I remained a week in 
Prague
, 
because this was my passport, I couldn™t leave 
[indecipherable]
 or something. So 
we had Œ we stayed from there Œ at 
Œ at Œ in the meantime we were in

Moshe [indecipherable] 
he 
never liked to tell me b ad news. He used

Mosh e 
calls, he said, 
Mo sh e
, where 
are you? You™re not in jail? Where you ca
lling from? He said home. You™re not in 
jail? No, what jail? So I heard y-yo 
Œ I heard you Œ wh at is, you were smuggle 
something? I don™t know. Anyhow, he™s
 caught something Œ doing something 
wrong, I don™t know what that is.
