Frieder
, 
hism other and sister hadfledf rom Nove Mesto.  In October they made their wa y 
northeast to Banska Bystrica, which served as the center of the uprising.  B
ecause of  his 
connectiontothe working group, Gideon'sfatherf led separately.  On thismap of Slovakia, the 

arrow points tothe locationof  Banska Bystrica.  As the Nazis were nearing BanskaBystric a, 
thefam ily f led to the mountains where they were caught in a massacre at Stare Hory.  
Gideon's mother and sister were killed there. 
 
 
Gideon was takenf rom  the m assacre siteby Henr y Herzo g who

W ith that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcom ing our
 
F i rs t  
Person
, Gideon Frieder.
 
[Applause]
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  I'm  always am azed when people clapbefore you start talking.  How do you 
know it wi ll be worth while? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  It will be. Gideon,thank you so muchfor joining us,f or your willin gness to be 

our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
today. W ehave an hour, and you have so much to tell us so we'll get righ t
 
to  
it .
 
 
I'd like to go back to your f am ily's earl y years.  Although 
Germ any overran Poland in 1939 and soon dom inated Europe, your hom e country of Slovakia 

was allied with the Germ an
s 
and was not occupied until m uch later.
  
Bef ore we talk about the 
sta rt 
of the war and the events leading upto the occupationby theGerm ans of Slovakia, tell us 
a bitabout yourf am ily, their lif e,and their com munity prewar, what that was likefor them .
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W e were relativel y sheltered, I would say.  My f ather had a reasonably 

high position.  He was the chief  rabbi of the comm unities inSlovakia.  He was ver y well 
connected to the governm entbecausehe was one of thef ew rabbis who spoke f luently of the 
languages of the country.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How m any languagesdid he speak?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Ithink he spoke about six languages.  By the tim ehe diedat theageof  
36,hehad a diary writt en utilizin g all the languages.  He was an amazing person.  Because of  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
6
 
his position andbecause of his tiesto the government, we were relatively spared. T he only 
thing which I knew is not to go to certain streets in the town becausethe kids will hit m e
, t
hrow 
st icks a t  m e
 
fo
r reasons unknown tom e but clearly known later.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you have a large, exten
ded fam ily?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  No, we didn't have a large, extendedf am ily. W e had an uncle who lived in 
the same town who was also the teacher in the Jewish school.T hat's all. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know m uch about your m other? 
 
>>
 
Gideon Frieder:  I know ver y little.  She died when I was 7 years old.  I rememberher as 
m other.  Not as a woman.  Not as aperson.  I know ver y little abouther. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your father, who was both a rabbiand ahighly educated man, both in 
a 
religious senseand in a secular sense, inhisprof essional lif e was very in volved in tryin g to 

build a Zionist community in Slovakia.  I think a lotof his work was agricultural related.W hy 
was that?
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T hat's right. T he Zionistm ove
ment at the tim e, the late 1930's, beginning 
of  1940's, was centered around com ing backto the landof  Israel
.  A
n d  c om i n g ba c k  t o t he  
landof  Israel meant rebuilding the country
.  R
ebuilding the country m eantagriculture. T here 
was no industry to speak of at the tim e in the holy land.  So com ingback was to join the 
settlem ents and to becom e agriculturalists.  So there were three agricultural schools in 
Slovakia. T here was a concentration on agriculture.
 
 
It was also unusualf ora rabbitobepart of the
 
Z io n is t  
m ovement because the Zionist 
were them ost secular than the Orthodox would like tobe at the

tim e. But he was invol ved.
  
It helped thatduring his studies to get the ordination, he also 
f inished f ull
-
tim e a secular university.  He got a degree in
 
philosophy and Germ an literature
 
a
nd laterf inishing his doctorate, but it was after the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  By contem porary standards, incredibly educated at that time.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  By any standard.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Absolutely.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Finishing two degrees in such diversef ields
,  
so to speak.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And he was clearly a comm unity leader at that tim e.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Yes, he was.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were not yet 7 years oldwhen Germ any occupied Slovakia
 i
n A u gu s t  of

, a
nd yet the war began in Septem ber
 
1939. T ell us what youcan about those yearsfor 
you and yourfam ily to theextent you can tell us about that between thebeginning of the war 
and whenGermany cam e in toSlovakia in 1944. W hat was that period like?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Essentially there were two periods in that period.  From 1939 to 1942 

Slovakia was allied wit h the Nazis, buttherewas no Nazi presence
, n
or were there 
deportation.  In 1942 the Slovak governm entstartedtodeport Jews
 
--
 
n o t to Ge rm a n y, to 
Auschwitz, the exterm ination cam p.
 
 
Slovakia is possibly the only collaborating country which was 
distinguishedby thefact that the Slovak governm ent paid the German governmentfor every 
Jew they took to be killed. And you can ask,where did they
 
get them oney to pay to the 
Germ ans? It's very si m ple. T hey conf iscated Jewish property topay the German to kill the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
8
 
Jews f rom which they conf iscatedthe property.  Very, very c lean operations. 
 
 
So althoughthere was no persecutionfor meandm y fam ily, per 
se, because of the position of m yf ather, there was persecution.  And in 1942there were the 
deportations.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  F o rmally.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Form ally, the deportations enm asse
, a
ndobviously in 1944 when the 
uprising, the Nazis invaded.  Butuntil 1942
,  
and for m e until 1944, a child, not going to certain 
streets,not seeing certain people
, t
o me it was a regular war.
 
>> Bill Benson: T onot go to the certain streets and see certain people was because?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Because I was a Jew.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you know that was the reason?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  No.  I just knew that the kids would hitm e if I would go to the street.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you experiencedthat. Right?
 

>>
 
Gideon Frieder: T hey would call me certain nam es.  Form e, you know, thinking, well, ok. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you experiencedthat, too.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Iexperienced that.  But Iknew not to go to those streets.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But otherwise, you said, thatyou hadafairly sheltered early lif e.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How was it sheltered?
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W e had a large yard.  I had, what was it
,  
a cheap, little sm all one.  Ihad a 
sister.  People would com e tothe house.  It was abig house.  I didn'tf eel anything.  Iobviously 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

was not aware of  the war or anything. T herewere no Germans.  I knew to avoid the Slovak 
fascists who were especially unif orm ed, the 
H
lin k a ™s
 
guard, they had special uniform s you 
could recognize them.  I was told to avoid them . Otherwise avoidance was part of life
 f
or m e, 
you don'tdothat in the same way you don't
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You knew what was outof  boundsf or 
you.
 
 
During that period,assuch a leader in the com munity, what was 
your f ather's role? W hat was hedoing during that very dif f icult tim e? 
 

>> Gideon Frieder:  Obviously as a child, Ididn't know what he was doing.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .  Righ t .
 
>> G i d
eon Frieder:  But af ter I grew up, I was able to read hisdiaries. T here was a book 
published based on his diaries. There was aver y unusual group inSlovakia.  It's known 

historically in its German name. TheEnglish translation is 
T
he  
W
alk i n g 
G
roup.  I
t was an 
unusual assembly of people of various lif e, including an 
O
rthodox rabbi, a personfrom  the 
extrem e left Zionistm ovem ent,a personf rom Zionist,m y father, and so on.  It was headedby 
a wom an, 
G i zi
 
F le is c h m a
n
n, which again was unusual at the tim e. Unusualat thetim e period.  
T hat group was the underground government of  the Jews.  It was collaborating with theother 

underground. And m yfather's role was theSecretary of  Stateof  this group, soto speak. He 
spokeall the languages that were nece
s sa ry
, s
pokef luently Slovak, graduatedfrom  the Slovak 
U
niversit y, spokef luently Germ an, communicated with the Germ ans.  He spokeLatin, 
comm unicated with the church. It was at the tim e thatLatin was theoff icial languageof  the 
church.

>> Bill Benson:
  
And in Slovakia it was predom inantly Catholic.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Slovakia was at thetimeand is so
 
today 
8
0% Catholic. Theother 20% is 
P
rotestant.  Evangelical, they called them inSlovakia. T hey don't call them  P
rotestants. 
 
He could com municate with them .  His role was interfacing to the governm ent.  T here are 
stories about it, which obviously I didn't know as a child but came to know later.  In order to 
gain inf luence with thegovernm ent hefoundoneof  the secretaries,the governm ent, tobea 
gu
y who was a politician but whose goal in life was to get a 
D
octorate.  Som y f ather wrotehim  
a doctor.
 
>> Bill Benson: W rote his thesisfor him .
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  It was publishedbut not in m yf ather's name,under his name. But 

becam ea certain psychological dependence, camaraderie, which was unheard of between a 
Jew and afascist
,  
really.  And thathelped him.  Because many tim es when m y father went to 
work with him  onhis dissertation, he would be lef t in hisoff icefor awhile and he would beable 

to look through documents.  It'sall documented inthe diaries,the way, obviously.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather'sdiaries.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  My f ather's diaries. By the way, they are available online now in 
Georgetown Universit y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Areall the volum es?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  All the volum es.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henI first met Gideon, only a couplehad beentranslated. Wow.
 
>>
 
Gideon Frieder:  All of them . They are not processed inthe sof tware that youm entioned 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
yet.  They are in theoriginal form . Once we f inish with thepatentprocess, we'll process them , 
clean them  up,and there will be two versions, theoriginal and the processed on the website. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you've explained to usa little while ago, although the Nazis did not begin 

m assdeportation of Jews in Slovakia bef ore1942, they were being deportedbefore then,as 
you explained. TheSlovak governm ent was paying the Nazis to deport. They were also, 
during that timer there were Pogrom s going on againstthe Jews in Slovakia. Tell usabout 
th a t. 
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T here were m any things going on. T he Slovaks created work cam ps.  

T hey concentrated the Jews
 
in the work cam ps. T hese were not exterm ination camps. The 
real work cam p,they had factories. I wouldn't call them factories. W orkshops. T here were 

workshop
s 
that they contributed to the war fought by the Slovaks. And they hadfree slave 
labor.  An
d in thoseplaces the Jews were concentrated. 
 
 
T hoseplaceseventually becam e the hubf rom which the Jews 
were deported to Auschwit z maybe.
  
But at the beginning,before 1942 and clearly bef ore 
1944, the Jews were concentrated inthese cam ps.  Most of the Jews were deported later.
 
T here were conf iscation of property.  
 

 
Oneof  the works 
I 
did in the museum was on the archives of  the 
Slovak governm ent. And there'sa beautiful letter there, beautiful, written inalm ost 
calligraphy
 
by a wom an writing to the President saying I'm  a God
-
fearing Christian wom an and next to m y 
house is this shop owned by the Jew, and why should the Jew havethe job, this shop,andnot 

m e?  So things of  thisnature happened all the time.  Conf iscationof property.  Everybody you
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

spoketo was conf iscated, shipped to the camp because there was no place to live.
 
 
So that was going on.My f amily was not affected. Im eanm y 
f a m ily wa s
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your im mediate.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  My im m ediatefam ily.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You shared som e docum ents that were relatedtoa census that the Slovak 
go
vernm ent did of theJews.  T ell usabout the significanceof  that.  You showed me someof  
the docum ents f rom  that. 
 

>> Gideon Frieder:  Yes.  And Ihave them.  I'll take some tim e which I
 
did not intend to do.
 
Af ter the war, af ter thecollapseof  the governm ent
 
--
 
I'm sorry.  After the collapse of the 
Comm unist governm ent, Slovak, there was an effort to revive the legacy of the Jews in 
Slovakia.  And the guy to do it, the curatorof  the Jewish museum  there, had diff iculty of 
spelling thenotions ofwhat the Jews did to the Slovaks.
 
 
T o put it inhistorical perspective, there's a record of the Jews 
being in Slovakia together with the Rom an Arm y well bef orethe time that the Slovak tribes 
ca m
e toSlovakia.  Soas inhabitant of the part of  theplace, the Jews predated the Slovaks. 
But that'shistorical irony.
  
Butdescribing them yth in the Slovak com munity, the Jews wer e 
living in the big cities sucking theblood of the poorSlovaks, unquote.
  
And the diff iculty of  
dispelling it, they didn't have date.
 
 
T hem useum acquiredthearchives of  the Slovak f ascist 
governm ent. Am ong them they acquired thecensusdone in1942.It was called the Census 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
of  the Jews. T his was the nam e. In1942,t
he  S l
ovak governm ent, essentially
 
t h e  n am e of  
ever y single Jew they canfind. W efound in the archives the pages.  And Iprocessed them .  
T hat was partof m y vo lunteering work.  I f ound m y nam e there, obviously.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather's, yourm other's.
 
>
> Gideon Frieder:  My sister's nam e, m y mother's name. W hat was interesting, seeing the 
m ap
, 
Slovakia at the tim e, even today, is smaller than the stateof Delaware.  Just to put it in 
perspective. W efound the Jews were li vin g i n 1,073 places in Slovakia. T hereare only about 
four,f ive large cities. They were not concentrated. It was a largenumber in the city, but they 
were all over, perm eated
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T he entire country. 
 

>> Gideon Frieder:  And we now have onlinethe capability to discover every place where Jews 
lived in Slovakia.  Thecensusalso,by the way, ser ved as thebasisof the deportation of the 
Jews.  T hey didn't do it for academ ic reasons.  No.  How m any Jews thereare. They did it to 
know what property there is.  It was done indifferent steps, wom en, prof essionalsand soon.  
Separatepartof  the census.  
B
ut the com plete census, the 1942 census. And we in the 
m useum  here have other census available.
 
 
By the way, before we say that Slovaks were so niceas to give 
us thesepages, themuseum  paid
 
$1for every page that the Slovaks gave us.  So it's notfrom  
the goodness of theirheart. Som ephilanthropist contributed a lotof money to enable the 
m useum  to get it,butwe have it.
  
W enow also have, just recently got, othertr
anscripts, the 
trials of  the collaborators post

doing a wonderful jobdeciphering everything which is going on.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And they're yet to be transcribed.  Right?
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T hey are in digitalf orm  but they are not in searchablef orm . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I learned f rom  you,Gideon,that thef irst Jews to be deported toAuschwitz 
cam ef rom  Slovakia. Did I get that right? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T hat's m y understanding.  That previously Auschwit z was not for Jews.  It 

was a concentration cam pnotfor Jews.  Andwhen the Jews cam e in, they were either thef irst 
or part of  the f irst. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You and yourf am ily existed under those circum stances.  And then,of  course, 
there was the SlovakUprising against the Slovakian governm ent in 1944,and then that 
brought the Germans in tooccupy Slovakia and your life would change even more dram atically 
andprof oundly.  After that,tell us what led upto the uprising and then what the imm ediate 
e f f e c t 
was for you andyour f am ily. 
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W ell, you know, it's nice to be on the sideof thevictors.  In 1944, it was 

ver y clear to the Slovaks that the war is over
 
--
 
the war is not over, but the Germ ans
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Are losing.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T here was a strong partisanforce. There were two partisanf orces in 
Slovakia.  Partisanforce supported by the government in exile, which was in London, 
W
es t er n  
leaning, and the Comm unist Soviet leadinggroup of partisans.  Miraculously these two groups 

got together and created theuprising.
 
 
Not everybody who looks at them ap understands thatthe

Germ ans could not letit bebecause it would stopall the possibilities tomovef orcesf rom  the 
south and north. Andwhat they did, they sent a couple of divisions of W affen SS, them ilitary 
part of
 
the SS, a very m otivated, well
-
trained and well

the am bulance lef tthe town,

T hey wanted him.

Zvolen, the south. But when the Germ ans cam e, 
they

Mechanized divisionsare ideal in a plain.  And everybody f ledto the m ountains because

Kids, boys.  It was cold.  So boys, girls, doesn't m atter,all wore ver y thick woolen stockings

say lucky.  But I was lucky.  No m ajorartery was severed.  Nom ajornerve was severed.  It 

was a f lesh wound.  And theblood gushed out of thef lesh woundand saturated the stocking.  
Andbecause it was cold outside, the blood coagulated.  So it was abandage, pressure 
bandage.  
 
 
T ho s e  of

Dirt

So they observed the village.  It's very quiet. T hey takem eto thef irst house. 
 
 
T here are different stories about whathappened there. My 
recollection isthat I was accepted wholeheartedly.  If elt very welcom ed. T hey fedm e. They 
went through the whole process toassurethat Iam secure.
  
From  the writing of  Adam , they 
cam e tothe village and they were quite f ierce looking. They were not
 
sh a

had m atted clothes, no unif orm , hand
 
gr e n ade s
 
hanging f rom  every place.  They had the 
Germ an 
weaponry, 1947 submachine gun. They didn't look very f riendly.

I ' m  a s o

they wil l be rewarded if they take me. In any case, if they don't takem e, they will kil l them . So 
they had very l ittle choice, didn't they?

T he people who saved m y lifearedead. Butthey died quite 
young.  T he person we m et was their daughter, which I didn't know existed.  So she was not

said,m y parents talked about you many tim es

You know, in every language there isa saying

I can repeat it

som ething
 
which I should keep as an heirloom . It was a note I wrote them  in Decem ber

on a piece of paper torn out of a writing block, greeting them for thenew year andf or

in Slovak.  And I listened to it. It hit me like a tonof bricks.  It was sofamiliar.  Ididn't know

>> Gideon Frieder:  Yes
, e
specially the children.  It was a hierarchy of f earf or the children.
 
So there was the regular GermanArm y.  These were old people.  All the young people were
