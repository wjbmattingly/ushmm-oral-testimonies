Interview with Eugene Miller 
April 10, 1992 
Rockville, Maryland 
 
Q: Dr. Miller, could you please tell me  your name , 
your name during the war, your date of birth, 
your place of birth, and anything you possibl
y can about your childhood and your fa mily. 
 

A: All right.  I was born in Poland, October 16, 192
3.  My fa mily name  was Rosenblum, Eugene in 
Polish, it was Eugeniusz. And I grew up in the ci
ty of Lodz.  Lodz was 
an industrial city.  It 
was used to be called Polish Manchester, of
 about 600,000 inhabitants. Today is about 
1,000,000 people.  It was 2
nd
 largest Jewish community in Poland. It was inhabited by about 
200,000 Jews.  It was a vibrant Jewish community. My parents came to Lodz after fleeing 

Russia. They were ma rried in Russia.  My mo
the r  was studying at the University in Russia.  
My father fled Russia with my moth
er in 1923 during the Gurinsky regime. ____________ 
which was really the forerunner of KGB. They 
were arresting all the people who were by them 
the __________.  So my mother went to Lithua
nia, to the border, 1923, she was pregnant. 
____________, she™s going to parents to wait for birth 
and my  father crossed the Russian-Polish 
boundary and he was wounded by the way the Russian
s were shooting when they were crossing 
and arrived in the Polish city of Lodz.  My mo
the r  joined him. There where I was born.  I was 
born in mi ddle class family.  My fa ther __________. 
We  lived in a very nice section of town. 
 

Q: Do you know the name  of that section of town? 

 

A: Notobicuk 41. We ll, at that point, I better te
ll you some thing about Jewish community in Lodz.  
It was divided largely three different segments
. The Orthodox Jews which occupied section of 
town. They wore Hasidic garb. That was about
 40% of Jewish people in Lodz. That was a 
large section of the working class people and that was _______substantia
l amount of the mi ddle 
class or upper mi ddle class Jews who were rather
 prosperous and they lived, for lack of other 
words, in the nicer part of tow
n. Most of the people lived in apartments.  In Poland, you didn™t 
have the __________, the land was too expensive so 
you have big apartment buildings. We  had 
about five or six room apartment and like all of 
the people who live in this
 section of town, we 
have a ma id, a live-in ma id. We  have a gi
rl who came to cook and you always have some body 
who ca me  to the door, no washing ma chine, ever so often and done the wash.  I was attending 

private schools.  I was going to Hebrew gymnas
ium.  It was one of the few gymnasiums in 
Poland from which one could go straight to Poli
sh University with gove
rnme nt rights. We  
didn™t have to pass any exams. At the same  tim
e, when they issued the anfamatura which was 
probably the closest to it in the 
United St ates is the regents exams that you get in NewYork.  
When they issue the certificate of completion.  It
 was also recognized in the Hebrew University 
in Jerusalem and you could enter right away
 the University ____________ to pass a special 
examination. There were three schools, they called it 1
st
 gymnasium and 2
nd
 gymnasium. They 
were just across from eac h other and there was a 
girls gymnasium. As I grew up, we participate 
most, most of the children attended the school we re
 me mbers of Zionist organizations. At that 
time, probably what organization you belonged, 
it wasn™t  determined by your political views 
because we were just teached at that tim
e but it was determined by the shahim the 
representative of the ki
bbutz move ment, who was a better or
ganizer was able to attract more 
children.  I belonged to Hashoma Hatsayeer, alt
hough my parents were well off, it was left wing 
organization.  Poland by itsel f, even before Hitler, was anti-Semitic state.When we were going 

to school, I reme mber very often we have to cr
oss the so-called people university, and we went 
through a hail of stones thrown at us.  I reme mbe r
 when I was growing up after the dictator of 

Poland _________died in 1935, who understood that Po
land needed the mi ddle class and Jews 
were the mi ddle class. They were the professi on, they were the me rchants, they were the 
ma nufacturers. After he died, Poland became ope
nly anti-Semitic. When I went to sc hool, oh it 
was about 15-20 mi nutes walk, I passed at least 
five or ten intersections
 and there was always 
scribble on the corner, ﬁJews to Palestineﬂ.  S
o, since Poland was verantly
 nationalistic and they 
were afraid of Russia, it bordere
d on hysteria how they were afra
id of Communis m.  Jews, even 
from a ffluent home, just as a purpose of what they saw and the atmosphere in which they grew 

up, were drawn to left wing organization. And 
I find myself Hashoma Hatsayeer where we all 
realize although we were childre
n and I was fifteen and a half when the war started, we all 
realize that there is no future in Poland.  My pa
rents wanted me  to go to France, my fat her had a 
brother over there who was ma nuf
acturer, a silk manuf
acturer, he felt he wanted me  to go and 
study in France.  Polish Jews were not admitted, 
there were so me  Polish University but there 
were numerous clauses.  Nume rous clauses mean re
stricted quota for Jews.  It was very hard to 
get, so most of the Jews went to a university to
wn of Nance near St rasburg and they lost a year.  
They learned French and they got the degrees there. I was slated to go over there.  My 

childhood wa s a happy one but we knew there wa s no future in Poland. 
 

Q: What can you tell me , was your fami ly observant? 

 

A: Well, it was maybe in sense ofAmer ican valu
es. There was on big, great synagogue in Lodz.  
To Orthodox Jews, it wa s probably worse than goi
ng to a reformed syna gogue here.  But yet, 
the wome n were on the balcony, the me n sit on th
e first floor and my par e nts attend the high 
holy days. 
 

Q: Did you keep kosher at home? 

 
A: Quasi kosher.  Because of my grandfather, 
was quasi kosher. We  are not a very observant 
fa mily in the usual standa rds of Polish Jewr
y but still I went to Hebrew gymnasium a nd 
culturally we were very much Jews but quote,
 unquote emancipated Jews and not religious 
Jews.  My father belonged to Hartzerarde. 
  In Hebrew this is ______________. That was the 
___________________.  My mother worked as a volunteer for ORT whic h organization 
supported the teaching of trades to the Jewish ki
ds who didn™t have the fina ncial means to go to 

gymnasium.   Not that ma ny in Poland, a very 
small percent of children we nt to gymnasium.  
Probably, no more than five or ten percent.  
By Jews, much larger pe
rcent.  I cannot put the 
exact percentage but most of the children did no
t finish gymnasium. This kids were trained by 
ORT, they were in di re straits 
and so forth.  Naturally, the religi
ous Jews tried to educate their 
children in the religious schools, 
did not have governme nt rights. 
 

Q: What language did you speak at home? 

 

A: My parents spoke Russian among themselves, that
 was the language they 
knew the best but they 
spoke fluently Polish. As a ma tter of fact, my
 father spoke fluently Polish, German a nd 
Russian. So did my mother.  My mother also sp
oke French.  But to me  they spoke Polish.  I 
didn™t know that muchYi ddish.  I don™t know
 for the purpose of a background ma ybe, the 
Zionist begged the parents not to
 teach the kids Jewish, to teac
h Hebrew.  I went to Hebrew 
gymnasium.   I learnedYi ddish already from my 
father-i n-law a little bit after I got married and 
in ghetto but no, no, we spoke Polish.We  spoke 
probably Polish better than Poles because the 
way they were able to recognize 
that a girl which hadAryan l
ook but was Jewish that she was 
Jewish.  Jews  spoke pure Polish without any regiona
l inflection. Al most every Pole had a little 

bit regional inflection.  Our Polish was colorless or
 classic.   So we spoke very well Polish. I 
liked the language.  I don™t like th
e people but I still like Polish lit
erature, and so forth.  But our 
orient ation was very mu ch Zionist , because in
 our mi nd there was no other solution to the 
Jewish problem in Poland but to immi grate; immi gr
ation to Israel , to Palestine was re stri cted so 
probably most of us knew we would have
 to go to _____________some countries but Poland 
was not in our future. When the war started, I 
was fifteen and a half years old.  Polish radio 
started to broadcast the third or fourth day of 
war, urgent appeal all me n should go in direction 
of center ofWa rsaw which is about 120 kilos, that
™s from Lodz.  Most of the me n left.  I went 
together with my father. We  reachedWa rsaw 
before the Germans were able to lay siege around 
Wa rsaw. We  lived through the ba
ttle ofWarsaw. When I return
ed home, we were not allowed 
to have a ma id.  No gentile could work for Jew. But, we still had our apartment.  I had a big 

dog, a Great Dane. 
 

Q: What was his name ?  

 

A: Rex.The dog was seven or eight 
years old at that time.  I reme
mber it was two or three weeks 
after we returned.  It was still probably mi ddle of October or e
nd of October.  My mother took 
all of her jewelry except one small ring off 
of her hands and some body knocked on the door.  

My mother opened and a German, a German 
non-commi ssioned officer pushed the door open, 
grabbed my mother ™s hand and tried to take 
the ring off.  He didn™t see the dog. The dog 
jumped. The dog was 140-130 pounds Great Dane. He 
went to the floor a
nd he went to his 
throat. He pointed the gun at my mo ther and 
he told to me  you won™t take the dog away, I™ll 

shoot your mother.  I said ﬁput
 your gun away and I™ll try to ta
ke the dog but don™t moveﬂ.  I 
took the dog away and he told my mother should
 take her coat, she is going to the criminal 
police and he will charge that we instigat ed th
e dog to attack a German soldier. Well, my 
mother spoke very well German. Sh
e told, ﬁall right, I want al so to ask if the German soldier is 
allowed to act as common robbers if all that
 we have belongs to the German government, you 
certain of the German governme ntﬂ. We ll, af
ter long negotiations, my mother gave him some  
valuables. He relented but I had to take the dog down and I had to tie him, that was a 

contraption that was used to beat
 the rocks, clean the rocks and 
I had to tie the dog.And he shot 
the dog. That was the first thing I lost. I was si
ck for three weeks.That was the first loss of 
some body I love.  I loved the dog because I grew up 
with him. We ll, things got worse. We  
were ordered to put St ars of David, the yellow patc
hes in the shape of the star. We wore one on 
the left breast and one on the back.  I said 
I™m not going to put it on and I went out and I was 
caught and I was very badly beaten. When I came hom
e, I told my father that I wanted to go to 
Russia.At that time , to Russia occupied zone.At  that time, Russia allowed every few weeks, 

the people who come  there divided dema rcation li
ne to cross Russia occupied part of Poland.  
My father told me  he doesn™t ha
ve the strength or in
clination to go.  He said son, you mi ght not 
realize but to go to Russia is one-way ticket.  
You will be able to get in but you will never be 
able to get out.  I fl ed fr om there. I™ ll take my chances with Germans. And that wasn™t  just my 

father. To them the Russians were the occult 
Bolsheviks and this and they still felt the Hitler 
regime was aberration and whatever will happen, 
they™ll survive the war and things return to 
normal and they will live in fr ee Europe.  So they gave me some valuables and sent me off.  My 

mother told me  when I was leaving on my wa y to Russia, ﬁSon, take a good look at your 

parents. You will never see them again.ﬂ A
nd I went and I was an only child, 16 years old, 

never away from home  e xcept when I went to su
mmer camp. And these words, I coul d hear the 
words in my  ears to the entire way I reached th
e Russian boundary and they were supposed to 
open the day before. I waited for about three or four days.  I decided, well
 whatever is going to 
happen is going to happen to me  and my parent
s and when I returned, 
they were already in 

process of setting up ghetto.  
The ghetto, I think, was establ
ished in the first month, I don™t 
reme mber the exact month, some ti me s aroundApril of 1940. The ghetto boundaries were 
already established and the Jews 
were encouraged to move there.  Nobody was moving. At that 
time, the Russians had deported or repatriated ra
ther, the German population from Lat via, from 
Volhynia, from the parts of Poland, in particle, 
they were mos tly by Germans, in the states 
which Russia occupied after 1939 and they were gi
ven the choice of Jewish apartments as we 
lived in the nice section of town
 whe r e one of the parents were to go. Two German officials 
came and told us we had one hour and we coul
d take whatever we could carry plus ______. 
(couldn™t hear) to go, so we went. We  were able 
to get a room in one of the two or three homes 
which had modern conveniences like water, flush 
toilets and so forth. The ghetto to which they 
press around 150,000 -- 160,000 Jews, was occupi
ed before probably by 10,000 -- 15,000 
people and that was the worst slums __________ by l
ooting. There were very few buildings 
which really resembled anything we know before 
we got the room in one of these buildings.  
They closed the ghetto and in the beginning it 
was already no more horrors by the Ge rmans, 
there were no more beatings, there we re no mo
re shootings. The ghetto started to organize 
itself but almost from the beginning the rati
ons of food bec a me  much smaller and we got 
progressively less and less to eat.  I didn™t finish 
gymnasium before the wa r.  I finish in ghetto.  
Polish didn™t have right. They forbid Polish to ha
ve any kind of schools. They close all Polish 

schools.  Some how, they probably knew they 
were going to liquidate 
the population sooner or 
later they pay no attention so schools open in ghe
tto so I finish in ghetto. What happen in 
ghetto in beginning years, it was a slow starvati
on. The ______, a ma n in his early 60™s , he was 
a mi nor offi cial in the Jewish community.  He 
was active in Jewish orphanages. He never had 
children.  He raise quite a bit 
of money for the orphans.  He was one of the few people who 
didn™t flee when all the men left Lodz and went
 toWa rsaw. When the Germans came and he 
was there and they told hi m he is the alderman of 
the Jews.  He started to organize Jewish life.  

The me n were already had their blood which 
he bought by the grave of his wife which was 
buried there.  He was really widening up his ear
s.  Evidently, all the pow
er of the Germans was 
vested in him.  He became absolute ruler of th
e ghetto and to us he seemed like a ma n that was 
drugged with power  On the other feeling of course
 was that if we are going to ma ke useful our 
services to the Germans, good part of the Jews
 might survive.  No bodies even worst fears 
believed that the Germans would try to physically
 annihilate every woma n and child. We ll, he 

establish schools.  He star ted to establis
h so-called ﬁarbisinﬂ, th
ey were shops which 
ma nufacture various things with the Germans 
farvartung with the Germans were the people 
who admi nister the ghetto brought
 to the ghetto and they have
 a large number of people 
working in the resorts and in exchange they we
re sending food to the ghetto. What I reme mber 
from now on, I was still young but was rather a 
shielded childhood and we grew up in a hurry.  
What I reme mber was hunger, terrible hunger.  
And it started very, very
 slowly by the people 
who were middle aged. And I say 
people after 40, 45. They had st
arted to deprive.  More and 
more you saw people who had swollen feet, swol
len hands. The winters are very harsh in 
Poland and there was nothing to heat their apartmen
ts with or the rooms with. There was very 
little even wood or coal briquette
s to be able to cook some thing. 
People were very hungry. A lot 
of them tried to crumble the bread and cook th
e bread and ma ke a soup out of this so that 
physically they could pacify their hunger pangs. 
 But, they consumed a lot of liquid and the 
heart was not able to pump and the water settled 
in the feet and people st
arted to die out. And 
we had 60, 70 funerals a day.  50 funerals a da
y will be 1,500 people a month. That was in the 
beginning.  In the beginning, the 
funerals resembles more or less which were held before the 
war but sooner or later there was only ma ss gr
ave. We ll, like a ma ss grave, one mount under 
the other unma rked graves.  My father was ta
ken 1941 to Gestapo. They had the registers. 
_________ (can™
t  understand).  He came  very badly b
eaten and he died a fe w weeks later.  I 

was left with my mother. Things got even wors
e as far as the food was 
concerned.  But yet the 
younger people organize themselves, called Self-H
elp Organization. The morale was, well, we 
still felt that we had a chance 
to survive.  This had changed in 1942.  In 1942, the runcoston 
had a _________ assembly.  It™s 92, 50 years before and I still reme mber.  He said to us, he 

stand before us as broken ma n, that he devoted 
all of his later years to helping orphans, he 
organized orphanages even un ghetto and he tried to
 give him as much resources to survive as 
he could and yet he was ordered by the Germans 
that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews.  Jews over 
60 years old and children under 10.  He told us, y
ou have a choice.  Our police would take them 
and it would be dark in semi -orderly fashion or
 the Germans would come  and take them and it 
would be much worse.  If we want to surviv
e, the 100,000 Jews which at 
the point were locked 
up in the ghetto want to survive, they have 
to give up 20,000. We ll, the chorus arise, no, no, we 
all go. And if the reaction was th
e people concerned to this, it 
was empha tically, no. Ye t, they 
declare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their homes and the Jewish police went from 

house to house and there were some  doctors among 
them and they ma ke the selections. All the 
sickly people and the older people and the childr
en were taken away.  But what the Jewish 
police did was not good enough for Germans and they
 came.  Some  people were shot. They 
tore the children from the mothers™ arms. They 
beat the people. The mothers who resisted were 
shot on the spot.  In most cases, the wome n rema i ned frozen when the Germans took the 

children away.  Only when the child was alre
ady on the horse drawn wagon, they realize what 
happen, they start to chase and cry. We ll,they took the 20,000, 25,000 people. And from then 

on, almost every able -bodied ma n or woma n or t
eenager or this, had to work.  The food supply 
didn™t improve -- deteriorate, more and more.  
There was a lot of mi smanagement, in ghetto.  
He tried Rumkoski tried to store some  of th
e potatoes, you know, which were supposed to be 
rationed to the population. And th
e whole thing, the entire crop 
got spoiled.  In 1942, I think, 
1943, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of
 the collaborators in 
trying to extract as 
much valuables and this from the Jews, from th
e Germans, he appointed him head of the so 
called sondokommando.  He tried to 
bring some order to the ghetto. 
 In a way he did.  He ma de 
the thing look a little mo re effi cient.  In th
e meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more 
__________ were given and people were left 
in apartments.  3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when 
you walk the streets of the ghetto 1943, 1944 
you saw, they used to call mussermenc h,________ 
because the people pattern of 
working and bending looked like a praying Muslim. The people 
became living skeleton, some  of them were swo
llen, some  of them looked like skeletons and 
you could see a good part of the population was so 
emaciated that the war is not going to end 
soon, they are going to di e. Well, the ghetto lived until 1944. 
 

Q: What were you doing this whole time? 

 

A: I was working.  I was working in the office of a 
sort of a shop getting 
my rations.  In 1943, my 
mother died of starvation.  She 
lost we ight progressively and fi
nally she wa s not able to walk 
any more.  She stayed in bed cons
tantly. ____________(very low -- can™t  hear). 
 

Q: Had she been working? 

 

A: We ll, she had been working until she got sick.  She did ________ in a shop. Then she got sick.  
She got the typhoid fever.  She got sick, she never 
recovered.  She died.  I was left alone.  In 
1944, the Germans started to evacuate the ghetto.  
They ordered that people will report, about 
5,000 people a day, for deportation.  Of course, th
ey refused.  So to give the order for 
deportation. So the Germans took th
e enslight the head of the ghe
tto admi nistration, went from 
shop to shop promising that people will go into
 Ge rmany, living conditions would be better, 

they will be better fed and so forth but nobody trus
ted him.  People tried to avoid deportation as 
long as they could.  I left Lodz inAugust 23
rd
 1944. We  didn™t know where we go.  Probably if 
we would know where we go and whatAuschwitz is
, we would get vicious to board the trains 
and probably shot, but that woul
d be at least passive resist an
ce but we really didn™t know. 
 
Q: Had you heard about th e camps at that point? 

 

A: Lodz ghetto was the mos t  isolated ghetto 
in Poland. Every hundred feet you get a German 
guard. We  didn™t get no papers, nothing.  Supposed
ly, few survivors from Chedno were able to 
escape__________ but the population didn™t know.  
We kne w that clothes came back to the 
ghetto from the people who were deported, 
the old and the sick people and people had 
foreboding that nothing good come s and they prob
ably perish but they didn™t  know that 
systematic extermination and this. We ll, we boarded the train. There was hundred people in a 

cattle car in which we were transported.  
We  went for about three or four days. 
 

Q: Can I stop you?   I want to flip the tape over. 

 

(END OF SI DEA)  

 

A: All right.  So, when we boarded the train, th
ere were 100 people in our,
 whatever you call this, 
and what they gave us, there was one bucket wh
ich was supposed to serv
e if people wanted to 
relieve themselves. There was no water. A litt
le bit of food we took wi
th.  I think it took us 
about four days out to reachAuschwitz. We  ca
me at night. We  were allowed to take hand 
baggage.When the doors opened, we saw people 
pointing to us looked like a fine striped 
pajama s unifor ms.  But they spoke to us Polish an
d told us, ﬁplease leave 
all the things inside 
the car.  Just get out, get out, 
get out.ﬂ  Before we could do an
ything else, we for m a line, we 
saw a lot of SS running with the pistols and w
ith guns, whipping people and we were ma rching 
top a well lighted platform and Mengele was st
anding there and conducted the selection. And 
with a flip of the hand, some  went to the right, 
some  went to the left. We  had no idea what it 
means.  I we nt to the right. They took us
, they took all the clothes away, they shave us 

completely and they give us the striped uniforms and a numbe r and we were led to a barracks.  

Barrack that were forme r  quarters ofAustrian
 cavalry from beforeWWI a nd when you slept 
over there you could lay down on one side but we 
were pressed so much that there was no place 
to turn around.  I still have, 50 y
ears, I have scars about size of 
half dollar because we were all 
bones at that time and laying and pressing, the 
bones were pressing against the wood and the 
things got infected.  I was a
bout two weeks -- I wa sn™t  inAu
schwitz, I was in Birkenau.  
Birkenau was part ofAuschwitz complex but th
ere was, people didn™t work over there.  People 

were either sent to the gas chamber, either sent
 out to other German con
centration camps at that 
time.You could see when we went to the barrack, the flame s shooting and the block leader told 

us what it is, that the people fr om the selections
 are having appointme nt w
ith their forefathers.  
We ll, anyway, I was there for two weeks and I wa
s selected and put into a transport and I me t 
one of my former classmates, Jerry Malikoff and 
we decided that we stick together. And we 
were, together, almost to the end of the war.
We  were deported to the _______ commander of 
Dachau. That was a separate ________ camps of
 Dachau.  Dachau was much mi nor camp in 
comparison. ___________. There were just camps in which the Jews worked until they 

dropped dead and they send us more  and more a
nd more people..  I was in the lager 4 which 
was _______ I was in lager 11 which was _______, and we work on Commander Morris. All 

day we had to carry 50 pounds ceme nt sacks from 
early dawn till it got dark and we always 
carry number of people who died.  If you couldn™t 
work, they beat you to death. And we had to 

carry the dead bodies back because
 they have to count every day. We  stood on the appell pl atz, 
that was the place where they count
ed the prisoners and the nu mber 
of the prisoners had to tally, 
even if we stood late in the night.  I was lu
cky for a short while to get the job _________. Then 
they used us to take care of
 other prisoners. Whe n you are sick, when you get your slice of 
bread you couldn™t eat everything and there was a lot 
of bread left.At that time, I gained some  
weight but after a while the Germans got tired of 
it and they took away with the transport all the 
sick people, the block was li
quidated and we went back. 
 
Q: You weren™t too sick to leave, you recovered? 

 

A: That™s  right. At that time, 
I got infected feet and I got bl
ood poisoning and they took me  and 
doctor _______, the physician was later -- he a
ttended at our wedding.  My wife went to 
nursing school and he was direct
or of nursing school after the 
war.  He attended our wedding  
He told me , you come  son, I have to amputate or
 you die. And they didn™t have no anesthetics 
and he told me  ﬁbut look, you™ll be in pain 
but you™ll faint™.And few pe ople put me  on the 
table, they help me and I just realize at that mo
ment that they are going to
 take away the toes of 
my foot.They are going to amputate, I™ll be sent
 away to the gas chambers.  So with all the 
strength I have, I tore my self out
 and I run away.  I run away and 
I went to the working detail.  
At that time, I had no feeling in my foot 
_________ and I mu st have stepped on a very sharp 
stone and it cut deeply but that saved me  and th
e pus and everything starte
d to drain. After the 
war I still had operation and I ha
d pieces of bone taken out of my toes but I survived this.  
When theAllies st ar ted to come  in and they st
arted to come  in direction of Dachau fr om 
Ausborg, which was miles away, they put us all on th
e trains. Then they started to gather all the 
prisoners into the ma in camp in Dachau, although 
we were probably no more than twenty, thirty 
miles to Dachau, everything wass bombed, and I wa
s in transit for about four or five days.  
There was no water, there was no food.  Some  
people went crazy and they drank their own 
urine. Whe n my train came to Dacha
u, they unloaded ____________ boxcar. They unloaded 

my boxcar. That was the last boxcar they unloade
d.There were more dead than alive and when 
theAmerican army ca me two days later, they 
found the entire train, say 
the first five boxcars, 
boxcars full of dead prisoners. We ll, and what 
theAmericans done -- they put us. I was in the 
hospital for quite a few months and I decided 
to go back to Poland to see if anyone had 
survived. We  had, during the war, when we kne
w that they are going to take our apartment 

away, that sooner or later we had to move 
to ghetto, we had neighbors. Their name  was 
Mitche lene, they were Poles.  He was, the fa ther  of the ma n was Italian and the mother was 

Polish but they lived in Poland and we knew them
 very, very well. As a ma tter of fac t , the 
woma n was carrying _________, my mother wa
s carrying her _________.  I knew the people 
for fourteen years, from the time I mo ved in th
e house to the time  I was deported. My mother 

took all the crystals, all 
the china, all the silver up to th
em and said, ﬁLook, I doubt if we will 
get alive fr om the ghetto.That™s 
all yours.ﬂWe survived. We didn™t expect. Well, I went over 
there when I came. I went with the transport to 
Poland, Polish transport of 
course, repatriated to 
Poland, it wa s very easy to get on the train. I cam
e over there, I went on the tenth floor.  I 
knocked on the door. A woma n ope ned the door and sh
e tried to slam in my face.  ﬁWe have 

nothing, we have nothing.ﬂ   I wa
s just able to hold the door op
en and I said ﬁlook, I don™t want 
nothing from you.  I came fromAuschwitz and I sa
w the silver and the money and the crystals 
all mi ngled with blood. All I want to know, di
d somebody fr om my fa mi ly, my cousins, did 
survive, look for meﬂ.  She said ﬁnobodyﬂ and she slamme d the door in
 my face. I was three 
days in Poland and didn™t find nobody and went bac
k.  In the beginning, the liberated prisoners 
who were __________ in Munich, which is twenty
 miles from Dachau but I _________ north to 
Frankfort on Meine and __________ opene
d and I enrolled ____________. (Couldn™t 

understand him) .university and started to study pha
rmacy.  I got ma rried in 1948.  My wife was 
in nursing school at that time .  
We  came here. We ll, my story is for all the people who came  
displaced persons, who came  to this country. We
 worked for a couple of years and then I went 
back to school. I got my PhD from medical schoo
l fr om the University of Chicago and came to 
Wa shington, started with the govern
me nt.  For the last ten years be
fore retireme nt, I directed the 
______________ research departme nt that was 
the only large animal ____________ where my 
medical research was co
nducted. I retired in 1989. 
 
Q: Are there any other things from any time  in 
your life that you would like 
to add?   Do you think 
ma ybe you have thought of a
nything from earlier back? 
 

A: You mean fr om before? 

 

Q: Before the war, during the war, episodes that 
stand out?   I know you told
 me a number of them. 
 

A: Episodes that stands in my mi nd was the deportation in 1942.  It was a nightmare. The  cries of 
the people; the children torn from the  mother
™s arms.The old people who went in such a 
resigned way, with the look in th
eir eyes -- they know that that™s
 their last trip. They didn™t 
know what™s  going to happen to them. But they kne
w that that™s  the end. That was one. The 
second was the shock of comi ng toAuschwitz. Theselection. The realization. The flames that 

were shooting toward the sky when we were told 
that all the people who went to the left side 
were selected by Mengele. This probably I reme mber still most deeply.  I saw Mengele for 

about ten mi nutes.  Pass the line until I pass him 
by. I probably, if he would look like he looked 
then, I would recognize him i mmediately. The 
ot her thing which I reme mber was the will to 
live.  People wanted to survive.  People wanted to
 survive. They wanted to tell the story. We  
never believed at that time that the world rea
lly know what™s  happening to us.  People were 
clinging to their lives and they wanted to preser
ve some thing. The other thing, I never attended 
synagogue till my daughter was born and she was 
about six or seven ye
ars old, we lived in 
Chicago. One day, ________, she came  ﬁ Daddy, Daddy
, look, sisters are comi ngﬂ. I said what 
are you mu mbling, what sisters?  I look and I 
saw two nuns. And I said, ﬁJudy, tomo rrow you 
go to Sunday School.ﬂ And I took her to Sunday 
school. But it took years for us to reconcile 
and regain some kind of emotional balance alth
ough we are outwardly very, very well balanced, 
but the whole comi ng to the United St ates, tryi
ng to work, trying to get ______ degree. We ll, 
people were really subconsciously 
trying to do, they try to do that ma ny things, that they went  
finally to sleep, they collapse. There was no 
time to think.  It was, I don™t know, I know there 
was no neurotic drive, only that there was self- 
preservation.  But people tr
ied, not to forget, but 
people simp ly were haunted.  It was almost
 in everybody™s mi nd, the question, people question 

ﬁ Why did I survive?  Why didn™t the other one 
survive?ﬂ And you know what was probably the 

most painful question was when you talk to people and they didn™t meant nothing. We  did hear, 

just very innocently asking, ﬁ Why and how did you 
survive?ﬂ We  couldn™t -- it helped them.  
We  couldn™t answer the question ourselves but people felt guilty without being able to explain 

to themselves that they are not guilty of nothing 
and it took number of years.  It took quite a few 

years until, you know, the children came and lif
e went on, and we™re young and the things 
which happened receded and ________ accepting from
 God t hen, life went on and we raised 
fa milies and we became part ofAmer ican society. And I hope we contributed. 
 

Q: From what I can see, you certainly have. 

 

A: When I finished, I had around seventy or ei
ghty papers and presentations on my city. 

 
Q: Amazing.  Can I ask you one specific question th
at you ma de a reference earlier to that you 
went to summer camp as a child, 
was that a Zi onist summer camp? 
 

A: That was school camp. We ll, it was a Zioni
st, not be definition, it was Zionist by what 
permeated. I reme mber as children we ma de th
e campfires and we stood and we sang Hebrew 
Zionist songs, yes, yes.  It 
was not a Zionist organized, but 
culturally it was a Zionist  camp. 
 

Q: Thanks.  Can we go on, would you mi nd talking 
a little bit about your mother now?   Can we do 
that? 
 

A: Ye s, sure.  My mother, like most of the 
wome n i n the mi ddle class, around a hundred mi ddle 
class fa milies, didn™t work. She was active, she wa
s active in Jewish life.  She travel ed. As a 

ma tter of fac t , my mother was in the United St
ates attending theWorld Fair in 1939.  She came 
to see her brothers. Whe n she 
returned to Poland two weeks be
fore the wa r started, her brother 
begged her to stay but you know, she said ﬁlook, 
I have a child and my husband over there.ﬂ  
When she crossed Germany, the train wa
s seeing, nobody could get, you know, she just 
transited into Germany, into 
Poland. If the war had broken out 
two weeks earlier, I would still 
have probably my mother alive. I reme mber 
in 1938, Germa ns expelled the Jews who were 
once Polish citizens. We  were not at that fa
r from the border.  Lodz, I don™t know, ma ybe two, 
three hundred miles from the borde
r, from the western border in Germany.  We  kept a young 
boy and I shared the room for a while
, I don™t reme mber, for half a year. 
 

Q: He came and lived with you? 

 

A: Ye s. The Jewish community took the children and then his parents came and took him away.  
They got situated. The brothers of my mother tr
ied to talk us into leaving Poland and comi ng to 
the St ates but my father was a me tal agent at that time. We  had _________, we were very, very 

financially comfortable and he felt, his reas
oning was, I don™t know th
e language, you can take 
no money out of Poland. You could just go as yo
u were. Wh at am I going to do over there?  
And he didn™t. He didn™t want to go and th
ey paid with their lives, my parents. 
 

Q: Can we go back, do you know your mother ™s  bi
rth date by any chance?  Anything, the town 
where she came from? 
 

A: Oh, yes. My mother came -- ju
st a second. Ye s, my mother was about 23 when I was born so 
she was born probably around 1900.  She lived in a sma
ll town in Lithuania, Batinia, Lithuania.  
My grandfather was very well to do.  He owned qu
ite a bit of land.  He owned a sawmi ll.  He 
owned a flourmill ad my grandparents sent us pack
ages in 1941 to the ghetto from Lithuani a.  
The packages reached the ghetto. They were killed -- the Lithuanians ki lled them even before 

the Germans.  In the two to three days when 
the Russians pulled away and before the Germans 
occupied physically the town, the en
tire Jewish population was finished. 
 

Q: Do you know about your mother ™s  education? 

 

A: My mother attended the university, in
 Russia _____________.  She was interned a year 
______________. 
 

Q: What was she studying? 

 
A: Languages. 

 

Q: What about the Jewish life in
 her home ?  We re they observant? 
 

A: Oh, yes, oh yes. My mot her ™s family certain 
was more, they were not 
Hasidic, but they were 
more observant.  Entire genera
tion, my grandparents were much
 more observant. My dad™s 
father was much more observant than we we
re.  But you have to understand one thing.  My 

parents went throughWW1. They lived already 
under the communist regime  for a while, for a 
few years before they were able to extricate th
emselves from Russia.  And probably just like 
today™s generation of the people veer from the stri
ct religious practices of
 their parent s, they 
veer from the strict religious pract
ices of their parents.  In othe
r words, the meat was kosher still 
at home but when we ate dinner, we could ha
ve coffee or tea with milk, you know. It was 
kosher but not in the strictest sens
e of this. We  had two sets of dishes and so forth.  I reme mber, 
I went for Rosh Hashonah andYom Kippur with my dad to the synagogue. 
 

Q: For Shabbat, you would work on Shabbat? 

 

A: We ll, there were candles. There were candles 
at home  but you took the st
reetcar.  My father 
rode the car, he had a car which was in Poland, th
ere were not too ma ny c a rs but he had a car.  
Shabbat was much more a tradition than a relig
ious observance. We  never went for Sabbath 
day and Friday services. The synagogue was qui
te a distance from where we lived and it was 
the only one big synagogue in ________ Lodz.  Our 
home  was a Zionist ho
me, much more than 
a religious home . 
 

Q: I understand.  I was just asking.  Can you te
ll me  some thing more about your mother ™s 
personality? Anything you can reme mber? 
 

A: She was young and she was full of life.  My mother played beautiful violin. She was not a 
concert violinist but I reme mber her playing for 
her friends and so forth.  She got active with 
several of her friends.  I™ve got a large fa mily. 
All three sisters of my mother and they got 
children, they are my cousins.  From the entire 
family, that™s  what I went to look for, I™m the 
only survivor.  She had two brothers in this c
ountry.  One of them, we took the name  of my 
uncle in L.A. 
 

Q: He sponsored you to come  here? 

 

A: Ye s, but when we came here, it is hard to expl
ain. The only thing what we were able to salvage 
from the old country was the __________.  I remember we came to Chicago and I already got 

my job.  I started very low class, then I got in
to the lab. Whe n I got in touch with my  uncle, 
when he called, my wife™s on the phone. All he wa
nted to know, if she™s 
Jewish. After talking 
to her, my wife left Chicago, she was at NIH, 
at the time she worked as a nurse.  My wife has 
_______ we have a large home  in L.A.Why don™t
 you come  out, you will 
live with us, I™ll put 
my nephew on the payroll ad he could go to school
. When I came my wife was almo st ready to 
pack. And I told her look.  He has two children.  
In spite of what he said
, the kids will say that a 
pair of refugees came and moved s mack into our 
parent™s home .ﬂ  I said you cannot have it both 
ways.  If you want to be independent you have to 
stay independent.  I we nt to visit my uncle.  
They were very nice to me . When I  was going 
to school for every Jewish holiday and Christian 
holiday, he sent me  $100 check and he tried to do it 
in a quiet sort of way. 
And it helped, at that 

time it helped.  But what we did, we did on our own. We  pulled ourselves up. 
 
Q: Have you tried to find out about family me mbers? 

 

A: I wrote them a letter.  I reme mber my fath
er-in-law was a very, very bitter ma n.  He never 
reconciled himself to what happened.  He just 
coul d not reconcile that
 people have wives, 
fa mily and this, you know, and his wife perish 
and his mother perish. 
 I was younger, but we 

were also bitter at that time. 
We ™re not bitter at nobody in partic
ular.  I wrote them a letter and I 
said ﬁlook, I™m at the university, I™m studying, I™m not asking for nothing, I don™t need nothing 

but you are entitled to know what happened to y
our fa mily.ﬂAnd I wrote it. And the answer 
was ﬁLook you never asked us for nothing, we di
dn™t  refuse you nothing.ﬂThey couldn™t  
understand probably __________, why the letters were
 so bitter. Whe n I came here, you see 
this is the difference probably between the 
immi gration, between the displaced persons who 
came here at that time. We spen
t very little, just  wanted a ch
ance.  Russian Jews, and I quite 
active now with Russian Jews, they expect much more. They expect much from society. We 

were so disillusioned, that we 
didn™t expect nothing from nobody. But, yes, I have contact with 
them, but I lived in Chicago, they lived in L.A. I saw them a few times. As a ma tter of fact 

when I got out from undergraduate school inAn
napolis, his wife came t o my graduation.  My 
wife has a family in Chicago. They showed us ________ when we came. They are not wealthy 

people but the children were pretty well off. Th
ey™re professionals and 
we got quite close to 
them. We  fi nally realized that they tried 
to be family to us and we integrated __________ 
(couldn™t hear) into the family. 
 

Q: So you still have other cousins? 

 

A: Oh, yeah, we still go to the weddings and Bar Mitz
vahs and to this and that. Ye s, these cousins 
___________. (voice faded out). 
 

Q: Is there anything else you would like to add a
bout your mother?   Either 
about her personality or 
anything else you mi ght know.  If I™m going to wr
ite this, I™d like to kno
w a little more about 
her youth or anything you know about it. 
 

A: I was, you know, I was very much of a child be
fore the war. I know my mother was a very out-
going person.  She was quite well --, for a wo
ma n were afterWW1, quite well educated.  She 
was very mu sical.  She attended and she liked co
ncerts and this.  She traveled a lot.  Every 
summer she was traveling in Ital
y andYugoslavia and this. While I was in summer c a mp, she 
was traveling. 
 

Q: With your fa ther? 

 

A: My father joined her but not for that much because he has _____ in the business, the factory.  
Ye s, but, so she was well traveled. Spoke language
s, was active in the Je
wish life.  She was a 
very good-looking woman, she was tall. 
 

Q: Do you know what year your parents ma rried? 

 

A: Oh, yeah.They ma rried in 1922.  She wa
s pregnant in 1923. _________ (speaking very fast) 
because she joined my father. 
 

Q: Did they me et in university? 
 

A: No.  My father was in Moscow when my moth
er started and he already had his own business.  
And he married my mother and they decided, he
 lost his business in 
the revolution but they 
realized that they are probably
 going to be arrested as a pa
rt of the campaign against the 
me rchants and this of the ______ in Russia, they 
decided to flee and thy 
fled.  My grandfather 
also fled but he fled to ________ but he fled a ye
ar later. All my uncle
s, the brothers of my 
father, also left Russia and they also settled in Lo
dz.  I have a large family.  It was a family of 
about seventy or eighty peopl
e and I am the only survivor. 
 

Q: Did you spend a lot of time  with them?  

 

A: Oh yes, oh yes. They were very, 
very close and very warm relationship.
