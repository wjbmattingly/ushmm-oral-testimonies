Ma nd l
 family, you 
know, for hundreds of

life. My -- my mother and 
father couldn™t vacation toge
ther because he ran the 
store, but my father would 
go off, I remember, to -- to 
Italy
 and to 
France
 and one 
time to the 
United States
. And then I would go w
ith my mother like to 
Baden-
Baden
 wh ere my  grandmother would summer. It was a very easy life. On Su ndays 
we™d go to -- there was a small lik e a z
oo, with the cafés an -- and there was a 
synagogue also in the s -- in
 the suburb there, which is
 where we went. And my m --

two servants and my  
mo th er -- my  mo th er 
did the co oking. The German 
hausfrau
 prided herself on he
r cooking. And took 
care of me and I -- and I guess she was in 
the store once in awhile. But I was an 
only child. And she had a sister in town  an
d a lot of friends, you know, and lived a 
very nice life.

Q: And her name? 
A: Was 
Rita. 
Q: You mentioned that your family was Or
thodox, can you tell me specifically what 
religious traditions your family observed? 

A: Orthodox in the sense th
at all the holidays were kept, but the store was open on 
Saturdays because it had to be. But -- and strictly kosher and my mo -- and we 

always had Friday night se
rvices, you know, at home a
nd went to synagogue on -- 
on Saturdays, at least my mo
ther and I did. And I don™t 
remember if my father did 
or not, but Orthodox in the sense 
that that™s all th
at was known.  
Q: Did you have a favorite holiday ? 

A: Oh, I guess -- I guess -- I guess it was Passover, 
Pesach
, because we always had 
Seders, you know, th e whole, long Seders
. And this was always kept up, the 
traditions in -- when we wa
 -- when we came to the 
United States
 too, and 
when ever possible. I was brought up in
 -- in a very Jewish feeling home. 
Q: Where did you go to school?  
A: I was not allowed to go to th e regular
 schools. There were no Jewish children 
allowed in the Jewish -- regular schools. I 
started -- I started out that there was a -- a 
teacher in that small syna
gogue there in the suburb
. And then I started going 
down town to the big synagogue, very, very
 famous art deco synagogue that -- and

that™s where I went with the other Jewish
 children. And I was only -- what was it? 
Well, I was born in 1930, so I -- I was --
 Kristallnacht
 I was eight years old. But -- 
but from the time I started school I -- I c
ouldn™t go. None of the Jewish children 
could go to regular school. 
Q: Did you ever have
 any German friends? 
A: Yeah, I had -- I had German -- the child
ren next door and other children. I had 
German little girls, but that had to stop to
o. They weren't allowe
d to play with me 
any more.  

Q: What kinds of things
 did you do for fun when you were a little girl? 
A: We had a big back yard with swings 
and we would swing an
d we would go to 
that -- to the zoo and th e circus, I loved th
e circus, my father would take -- took me 

to the circus and swimming. I had swi
mming lessons. And wi -- the way they  -- 
they gave swimming lessons those days, th
ey  put a harn ess on the kid and like hel-
held -- held -- held you by a rope and dropp
ed you in the water and you learned to 
swim. And we were allowed -- but that had to
 stop, too. This is when I was five or 
six years old, but then we weren™t ther
e because there was a municipal swimming 
pool. And my father had a motorcycle, I re
memb er riding around on the mo torcycle 
with him, which I didn™t lik
e very much. But I was a ve
ry studious child, I read a

lot. And that was fun to me, and th -- I 
guess -- you know, it was so long ago, I™m 
70 years old, so that™s abou
t it at rememberin g the fun. 
Q: Do you have any memories fro m before
 Hitler
 was in  power? 
A: Well, these things that I™m talk ing 
about now were be-before. Yo-You mean 
when  I was two, three, four years old? 
I spent a lot of time with my grandmother, 
who was -- when I was real little she li -- sh
e lived upstairs. It 
was a bighouse and I 
guess my  mo ther wasn™t too happy ab out 
having her mother-in-law live with her, 
but it was a very formal life. I would have 
to  go upstairs every mo rn ing and cu rtsy 
and say good mo rn ing to my  grandmother an
d we went for walks and we were -- it 
was a very structured life in -- in -- in 
Germany
. And children were seen and not 
heard, you know, so that -- 
that™s what I re -- you kn
ow, remember. I know I was 
registered at a -- at a -- a Swiss finishin
g school for -- where I was supposed to go 
when  I was like 14 or 15, and -- because my  parents were, you know, of the 

wealthier -- wealthier position because of being business people. 
Q: What anti-Semitic experiences do y
ou remember from your early childhood? 
You mentioned th-the swimming had to stop. Wha-Wh at -- 
A: Well, that I couldn™t play. That -- that I 
couldn™t play with the other children, and 
when  I knocked on th e door I was told, 
Gretchen
 can™t play with you, you know, 
don™t come back. And I don™t know 
if we™re jumping ahead, but after

Kristallnacht
, when -- I -- I -- I d on™t know ho
w I ended up at the down town 
school anyway, wh ich was the synagogue, the big synagogue, but the Nazis were 
there with -- with -- with the 
dogs and had -- were setting fi
re to the books that were 
inside, I guess the schoolrooms and th e 
library from -- from the synagogue. You 
know, and th ey™re saying get out of here, 
go back, go home. B
ecause the streetcar 
line ended and was just a straight run. And 
even at that age, at -- at age eight, I 

guess I went on the streetcar and went to school.  
Q: Let me keep you b
ack a little big younger. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Let -- let™s not go quite yet. What did 
your parents say to you wh en you went to 
your friends and they  said go aw ay , you 
can™t play? How did your parents explain 
the situation to you? 

A: They explained it that we have to obey,
 because it can be very dangerous if we 
don™t, and that I shouldn™t ask questions a
nd that I have to do what I™m told. But it 
was the type of upbringing anyway  wh ere 
-- where you were obedient, so it wasn™t 
that hard.  

Q: Do you remember seeing any anti-Sem
itic posters or newspapers or anything 
like that when you were very little? 

A: No, no, I have no me
mo ry of any of that.

Q: Did you ever hear your parents talk 
about the political and 
social situation in 
Germany
? Did they ever talk amongst themselv
es with you just kind of around, 
and could hear -- 
A: No, I have no memory -- no, I have no me
mory of that. I think that children were 
not to be worried and that it was -- I -- 
I knew -- my -- my memory really, concrete 
memory is more right aft-after 
Kristallnacht
 or -- or right -- right before, and the 
things that happened.  

Q: Before 
Kristallnacht
, how mu ch did you actually
 understand about what was 
happening around you? 
A: I really didn™t know, really, or didn
™t understand mu ch and didn™t know much. 
Q: Did you ever hear your pa
rents discuss plans to leave 
Germany
? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, I knew th
at we were planning to  leave 
Germany, 
because my 
mo ther shopped and shopped, including shoe
s for me for when I would be twe -- 10 
- 12 years old. They  were buying 
Leica
 cameras to se -- resell in the 
United States
 
because the lift van was going to come
 and it would get filled with all our 
household goods and th at we were going to 
America, 
and -- because my mother™s 
brother was here and we -- that™s where 
we were going. And that was the talk, 
waiting -- waiting for the -- for the number to 
come up and you know, the vi -- the -
- what was it called where you™re waiting 
for -- for your -- you had a number in

order to get out, but that I knew, that -- 
and I also knew that my  mo ther was going 
to -- and this was again, before
 Kristallnacht
, was going to 
Munich
 twice a week 
to take cooking lessons at -- at a --
 there was a -- like a chapter of the 
Cordon Bleu 
there, because, you know, 
they had no idea about 
America
, that they were -- she 
thought she could become a c
ook here because she was a very
 famous cook in -- in 
Augsburg
, you know, in -- in 
Germany
. And my father had come to the 1938 
World™s Fair earlier in -- in
 -- in the year and had taken -- and had arranged fo r the 
visas with my  mo ther™s brother, who came 
in 1933. And so I knew -- I knew -- that 
I knew ab out, I knew about 
America
. And they were taking 
English lessons also. 
They  didn™t learn mu ch, but 
they took English lessons. 

Q: Did they have any problems with
 getting the Americ
an paperwork? 
A: They -- they had -- they had the visa 
and they had th -the number, but it was not 
due for quite awhile. In other 
words, we couldn™t leave.  
Q: Can you explain the lift van? Y
ou said there was a lift van co ming. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Can you explain that? 

A: Yeah, a lift -- lift van is -- is the sameas a container on a -- on a -- on a freighter. 
It™s a great big, wooden box and all the be
longings are put in it and -- and those lift 
vans were -- for most people they were sent at -- for storage to 
Holland
. And th en 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001

the idea was that when you got -- were goi
ng to go to wherever you were going to 
emigrate to , they would then
 be shipped. And people paid
 storage and people paid 
freight, and there was many, many storehouses in 
Holland
 that had these lift v ans 
and they  were filled with all your belo
ngings and -- and hopefu
lly things that -- 
furniture and clothing and books and -- and ev
erything that you had, hoping for the 
life in the -- wherever your next haven would be.  
Q: Did you ever see 
Hitler
 or hear him speak? 
A: Yes, I did. I was at my  grandmother™s 
where, as I said, she lived right downtown 
on 
Bahnhof Ska zie
, w h ich means -- 
Ba hnhof 
is -- is the railroad station, the main 
street like -- be like 
Fifth 
Avenue
 
in
 New York.
 And sh -- we 
looked out from 
behind her lace curtains -- she lived, I th
ink on the third or fourth floor, an 
apartment build ing. And we were crouching 
down, she said, I want you to see th -- 
see this, this is history. We
™re not supposed  to be lookin
g, you weren't supposed to 
look out. But that -- that
™s the evil man, that™s 
Adolf Hitler
. And I saw him in his 
car, in his open car, just like in the movi
es, with the hand upraised. And I wa -- I 
was frightened. I was very, very frightened
, because it was so menacing. Well, it 
was all the accoutrements, you know, that 
was with him, all the staff cars and 
everything else. So yes -- 

Q: Wh-W hy was it dangerous to be looking at him?  

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
11
A: I guess there was a rule that Jews we
ren™t supposed  to -- to be looking a -- 
looking at him. You know, weren™t supposed
 to view him. Maybe they were afraid 
we™d get shot at or something, I have no id ea.  
Q: When did things start to get 
really very bad for your family? 
A: Things got really bad -- well, I th -- I 
-- I™m not quite sure, but I think my father 

had to close up the store maybe three, four, six months before 
Kristallnacht. 
Bu t 
people still, because they were so well know
n -- maybe it was even
 longer than that, 
people would come and pay their bills like 
behind closed doors, because Jews at 
that time already, their bank accounts were
 con -- confiscated. And I -- but because 
the good relationship th at my  family had w
ith the town and with
 -- with -- with the 
cities, that™s who we got along. 

Q: What do you rememb er of
 Kristallnacht
? 
A: I remember the -- the house had shutters
 on the outside and my  parents closed 
the shutters and I -- they pulled me in
to bed with them. Or maybe I got so 
frightened at the noises that I went, crawled 
into their bed with 
them. But they were 
throwing rocks, and the store had big shu
tters too, so they were trying to break 
down  the door. And then the 
next morning the -- in -- in 
Germany
 -- because it was 
all very old-fashioned, the milk was bro
ught by a milkmaid, sh
e had like a -- a -- a 
little wagon with a th -- I think a dog pu
lling it or something. And th ese metal 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin

containers of milk and the housew ife woul
d come out with her pitcher of milk and 
then you filled -- filled  the milk. And was 
-- I don™t know, seven, eight o™clock in 
the mo rning and I was -- mu st have been about seven, because I was dressed for 
school. And my mother told me to go to 
the door and you know, get -- get the milk. 
And it was not the milkmaid, it was two 
SS
 men. And they said, wh ere™s your 
father? And I said, he -- he was still upstair
s. And they said, wh
ere™s your mother 
and they  like pushed me aside and then came
 into the house. A
nd my mo ther -- and 
they wanted to go upstairs, 
my  mother said, I™ll get him, you know, don™t go upstair 
-- and -- and they ki -- my mother went up
stairs and got my  father and he came 
down , and meanwhile, they took all but 
her wedding band, she had, I guess, I 
diamond ring. Took the rings off of her, bu
t they didn™t take her -- her -- her -- her 
wedding band at that point. And my fath
er disappeared. And th
ey  to ok  h i m aw ay  
and they said they™re just taki
ng him to the police statio n in 
Aug sburg
, in -- and 
that™s -- that™s what I remember.  

Q: Had you ever heard of 
Da cha u
 before that night? 
A: No, I™d never heard of 
Dach au
, but that™s where my father ended up. 
Q: How long was he interned there? 

A: He was in 
Da cha u
 til the end of March. And th
e reason that he got out was 
because he had been a volunteer
 in the first World War, a
nd because of the family™s 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
13
long, long, long es
tablished times in 
Germany
, and because we had the emigration 
number. So he got out and he -- they le 
-- they let him out and he™s still in the 
striped uniform, shaved head  and he calle
d my grandmother on the telephone, and I 
reme mb er he came home and he was never th
e same again. My fa -- my father had 
terrible time holding a job in th e 
United States
 and he -- he was -- he was not a 
stable person. 
Q: A couple of questions. 
Do you know under what 
circumstances or what 
conditions he was released? 

A: He was released under the condition that we had to leave 
Germany
 within three 
weeks. And the neighbors on th e other side to ld him that if we™re not gone that he 
would never -- never be able to leave and 
th at they were going to  put him back, you 
know, put him in a camp perm anently. So at that point we left -- w e left with -- 
within two weeks, because as
 I said, the lift van was gone and the -- the house was -
- was relatively empty of -- of -- of furn iture. And we went to -- no, I think what 
happened, the lift van was all new furnitu
re, because we were
 in the furniture 
business, he was in the furn
iture business, a lift van that
 was all new furniture to 
come to 
America
 and the things in the house were 
left. We were still living in -- in 
the house, because th -- they
 were going to wait for -- 
for their emigration number 
and we went to 
Eng land
 to wait out the number.

Q: Do you know wh at arrangements had 
been made for your family to leave 
Germany
? 
A: The arrangements were that my father 
had been  sending some money to a Sw iss 
bank account, so -- just in case
. I don™t know whether it was for 
England
 or to help 
when we came to 
America
. And that™s the arrangements were, so that we were able 
to -- to live. And first class boat tickets on 
the -- at -- with  a sh
ipping comp any, you 
know, a boat comp any, had been  purch ased, 
but not for a specific 
ship, because they 
didn™t know wh en our number was going to co me up. 
Q: Can you tell me the state of your fathe
r™s physical health when  he was released? 
A: He looked like an old man. He was born in year 1900, so that made him 38 years 
old, only . And he -- he looked like an old 
man. He told  some -- I don™t know if you 
want me to talk about this, some 
stories, I remember, from being in 
Dach au
 and 
what it was like then already. Do y
ou want me to go ah ead with th at? 
Q: When  -- did he tell you at 
that time, or much later? 

A: Later. That h-he said he always believed 
in -- in -- in kismet. 
In -- In -- in fortune 
that you didn™t know was ga 
-- th-they were standing in 
line, they had -- now, this 
was November, December. They were standi
ng in line with just those striped 

unifo rms. Oh, I have to add, 
Da chau
 -- at that point there were no concen tration 
camps, it -- it was really a camp for crimin
als andpolitical prisone
rs and not as you 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin

think of -- they quick ly learned how to ma
ke it worse. And they
 got potato peelings 
and -- and herring, salt herring 
to eat. And stale bread. Th
ey  learned very quickly 
how to tr -- to treat the Jews. And they we
re standing in line and th e man next to 
him said, trade places with me. I feel -- I f
eel unlucky, or I feel 
lucky. Because they 
were -- they were going to shoot every fift
h man, or threatened to shoot every fifth 
man. And my father, I guess believed in 
-- in whatever will be, will be, and he 
traded places with him. And that man wa
s shot. And life was terrible, it -- it was 
absolutely horrible. Ho
w they knew s -- at th at stage already to treat people like i -- 
like animals, I don™t know. And I think th ey 
used as wardens some of -- some of the 
political prisoners, a-and so  -- some of the 
actual thieves and like that, to be the 
bosses ov-over the -- th-the political prisoners, th-the Jews. 

Q: What do you rememb er about th
e process of packin g up and leav ing 
Germany
? 
A: I reme mber being -- going on
 a train and we went via
 Holland
. And when  we 
got to the border, the condu
ctor co ming and saying, you
™re now free, you™re now 
free. And, little girl, you™re now free. And th  -- I was also  told during the journey to 

the border to 
Holland
 th at -- how to behave my self, not say anything. And the 
fright, I still reme mb er the fright of my  pare
nts, you know, that -- of being put off at 
any time. 

Q: What could you take w
ith you? You, personally.

your gran dparents, write very serious, like

And I think that the saddest was saying

goodbye to my  grandmother and my  unc
le. My grandmother would not come 
because her -- she was in partnership w
ith a s -- brother -- her brother, who had 
never married. And it™s the typical story, they
 were afraid that -- they didn™t believe 
it. They didn™t believe it and 
they didn't  want to just cl
ose the stores and they  didn't 
want to lose all that money,
 they didn™t want to lose 
all that property. And like it 
couldn™t be, not -- not with their history in -- in -- in 
Germany
. And she wouldn™t -- 
she refused to leave. I have some letters
 that she wrote to -- I have one living 
relative, my father™s brother has a daughter whose name is 
Ruth
, and they live in
 
Sao Paolo
, 
Brazil
 and she wrote to -- letters to 
them, which my  cousin has given 
me copies of, about how sh
e was only worried about them
 and about us getting to 
freedom and that she -- she didn™t think th
at she™d see any of us, you know, ag ain. 
And she was a very important person in -- 
in my  life, my  grandmother, because my  
mother™s -- I had no other grandparents. My 
father™s fat h er died when he was 19, so 
she was the great matriarch. 
And my mother™s father died a year before I was born 
and her mo ther died a year after I was bor
n, so there were no -- no grandparents 
except this one grandmother.  
Q: What kinds of things di
d you say to each other wh en
 you said goodbye to your -- 
your family and your fri
ends, wh at did you say?

A: I really don™t -- that™s -- has n o  relevancy for me. You know, I -- I don™t 
remember.  

Q: Did anything happen in the time be
tween your father™s release and your 
departure from 
Germany
? 
A: I was confined  to the house, I could no
t go to school any mo re, and I was -- and I 
-- a -- I don™t think I had 
any mo re schooling after
 Kristallnacht. 
I stayed pretty 
mu ch  with  my  mo th er. My  mo th er also  we
nt to Nazi headquarters and was thrown 
down the stairs, where she asked -- tried 
to find out what wa
s happening to my  
father. I also know that she sent packag
es with  long underwear and -- and -- and 
food to 
Dachau
, they were told they
 could send it. And I don™t know if it was 
through the Red Cross or through -- or just
 regular German channels, and he never 
got any of it. That™s the things that I reme
mb er, but I -- I was -- I was really kept at 
home.  
Q: What do you remember about the 
day, the actual day that you left 
Germany
?  
A: I-I just r emember b eing bundled up in a coat and -- and -- and that we were 

going. You know, I -- I -- I re
me mb er mo re the train journey. Yo u know, I™d never 
been on -- well, 
I™d been to 
Ba den-Ba den
 and I guess to 
Mu n i ch
, which is only 40 
miles away, but that I was going on th is long, long journey.  

Q: And your first stop, where was that? 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
19
A: Our first stop was, I think in -- must have been li -- 
LaHavre
, mu st have been in 
France. 
And then to get to 
England
 to get to -- because we were going to 
Lo ndon
 -
- 
Q: You took the train straight from 
Germany
 to 
France
? 
A: Right, to -- to 
France
, an-and then took the boat from la --
 LaHavre
 to 
Lo ndon
.  
Q: How long were you in 
France? 
A: To 
Southampto n.  
Q: How long were you in 
France? 

A: We -- we were -- we went directly, just
 -- just like a day. We didn™t stay. We -- 
we were going. Or, if there was a way -- 
there was no way. You couldn™t have gone 
from 
Holland. 
W-We mu st have stayed on the boa t -- I mean, on the train. I think 
the only way to have 
gotten there was -- I-I™m guessing at
 this, I really
 -- I really 
don™t know. 

Q: Do you reme mb er board ing the ship? 
A: The ship was much, much 
later when we came to the 
United States
. You talking 
about coming in the 
United Sta tes
?  
Q: Oh, okay, so you went first to -- to -- 

A: We lived in 
England. 
Q: Okay. So you went from 
LaHavre
 to 
Southampto n. 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
20
A: Yes. 
Q: And how did you cross the channel? 

A: It -- mu st have bi -- crossed on -- on 
-- on a ship. No, I don™t rememb er. I don™t 
remember that. 

Q: Tell me about your -- your arrival in 
England
 and -- and what that was like for 
you personally. 

A: That I remember. I remember
 w e w -- we went by train from 
Southampto n 
to  
London
, and my  father had a first cousin by the name of 
Alfred Marx
, who was ha 
-- who was there already, and he had -- he 
had two daughters. And he had a brother 
the name of 
Sigmund Marx .
 They  were waiting fo r us at, I guess, the train station 
in 
London
, and they  had gotten us a room in -- near 
Green Park
 in -- in
 London
, 
in somebody™s apartment. And I sl
ept on a co t. My parents went to 
Portobello 
Road 
and got a second hand cot a
nd it was filled with bedbugs. And I slept on that at the 
foot of my  parent™s bed, and we lived in
 th at one room. And my  mo ther registered 
me in school, and I went to the regular 
English -- English schools. And I played  
mo stly with my  cousins, because you know,
 I™d -- I didn™t speak English. And my 
mother worked as a ma
id, because you were not allowed to  come to 
England
 if you 
took a job while you were waiting for you
r emigration number. 
So the little bit of 
money they in the sw -- from 
Switzerland 
helped, I guess, pay for our food and -- 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin

and -- and -- and this room, and -- but by
 work ing as a maid, she got paid, you 
know, like -- like illeg al immigrants do here, under the table, as they say. And that™s 
the amazing thing, what -- what these refuge
es were willing to do from the type of 
homes and the type of -- of life that
 they led, in order to exist.  
Q: While you were in 
England
, did you experience any anti-Semitism or any anti-
foreign sentiment? 

A: Ah, no, no. I went to school with the 
-- where -- with -- with the children and I -- 
I don™t remember any 
-- any anti-Semitism.  
Q: How long did it take you to learn English? 

A: Well, the way that I learned English is
 that two weeks before the war started, 
which was in September, all the British -- 
London, Manchester,
 all the major 
cities, the schoolchildren were sent to th
e country, voluntarily. And how my mother 
and father found out about this, I will never know, but off I wa
s packed, with my 
book bag on my back and a li -- and a little 
-- little suitcase and was sent off to the 
countryside to a place called 
Saint Ippoly ts
, which is now part of 
Ipswich, 
to stay 
with a family called the 
Palmers
 and that™s where I really
 learned English, because 
it™s total immersion. I was supposed to be
 with my two girl cousins and we got 
separated and I wasn ™t in the same village 
with them, so I was 
totally by myself on 
my  own, nine years old. At that time alre
ady, tho -- that netting with -- with -- with 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin

the, like balloons was all over 
London
, I do remember th at, before the war. They 
thought they could stop
 the bombs with that. 
Q: Do you remember how your parents e
xplained to you about
 your leaving and 
why it was important that you leave them? 
A: They explained to me that they 
will come and get me, we are going to 
America
, 
but in order for them not to
 worry about me, th
ey wanted me where I would be safe, 
because they could that way better take 
care of themselves, a
nd they wanted me 
safe. So I went. You -- you know, I was a ch
ild, you did what you were told. And I 
don™t -- I don™t even  rememb er particularly crying or -- or -- or -- or anything. I just 

went. Maybe I thought it was ma -- maybe that
™s where my love of travel -- I travel 
constantly -- came from, that, hey, was a new place to go. 

Q: How did you learn about the German invasion of 
Poland? 
A: Of
 Poland?
 
Q: Beginning of the war. 
A: Well, that™s why, because we
 knew that war was imminent in 
England 
because 
of that Ge-G erman invasion of 
Poland
 and 
England
 was preparing to go to war, 
and that™s why I was sent to the country,
 along with  all these other children.  
Q: Let me make sure I™m understanding. 
So what you™re saying is at the very 
beginning of September, you were
 sent to the countryside? 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
23
A: Yes, two weeks before the war started. 
Q: So when you™re referring to
 the day that the war starte
d , you™re talking about the 
date that
 England -- 
A: 
England
 went to war. 
Q: Right. 
A: Right. 

Q: And what were your thoughts
 when war was declared in 
Eng land
? 
A: I was in the country already and I thin
k I was still getting used to -- to the life 

there, which was totally different than anyt
hing that I knew, that I didn™t remember. 
And in a -- already we -- even
 a -- even in school in 
England
, we had to do air raid 
drills and we had gas masks. And so it was 
-- it was already like a given, you know, 
it was -- it was part of your life. And we
 had ditches that were dug that we -- I 
remember the planes coming ove
r and we had to dive into 
the ditches. And we had -
- and go under the desk s at -- at school, be
cause I went to the country school there, 
of course, in -- in 
Saint Ippolyts.
 And so i-it -- it -- it just be
comes part of your life, 
part of the way you have 
to live. People adjust. 
Q: Were you the only refugee, 
or were you the only refugee from 
Germany
 among 
these children that we
nt to the village? 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
24
A: I -- I was the only -- only refugee, the only one who couldn™t speak English. But 
this family, this Mrs. 
Palmer
, she had a four year old ch ild -- or a three year old 
child, was so kind and was so nice. I have si
nce found out that I 
really lucked out, 
that some of these children
 were mistreated and -- an
d -- and were not happy. And 
she would bring me up tea in -- in -- in 
the morning and treated
 me totally as a 
memb er of the family. And wh at the peopl
e got was, they got the ration book from 
the children that they
 took in, and they 
got like a pittance of money from the British 
government. They did this out of 
th eir generosity. And even when  
Rosh Hashanah
 
came, my parents came to visit me. How th
ey found their way out there, again, I 
don™t know. And I rememb er mixing up 
Rosh Hashanah 
and 
Yom Kippur
, I 
thought you had to fast on -- on -- on -- on 
Rosh Hashanah
, I mixed it up 
completely. Not that as a child
 I had to fast, but they -- 
when my parents came, they 
had them for dinner with -- with the Sund
ay roast and like that
. They were very 
kind people and I learned to speak
 English with total immersion. 
Q: How long did you stay with the 
Palm ers
? 
A: Til about the 14
th
 of December. So it was Septem
ber through Dece -- you know, 
about three and a half months. 
Q: And why did you leave them? 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
25
A: Because our number 
came up to come to 
America
 and we went to 
Southampto n
 and got on th e 
SS
 
Vo lenda m
 and -- wh ich was the 
last ship to cross 
the ocean before 
United States
 went to war then, 
in 19 -- what, ™41? 
Q: When you left 
England,
 you and your parent
s, what were you able to bring with 
you? 
A: We were able to bring one trunk, it™s a 
great, big steamer trunk, that™s what they 
took to 
Eng l and
 with them, and they had about 
20 or 30 dollars by the time w e 
arrived in 
New York. 
Q: What happened to  all the 
things that you shipped to 
Holland
? 
A: The Germans -- the -- the government -- 
German government when they in vaded 
Holland
 robbed all those warehouse and emptie
d out all those lift vans and to ok ev 
-- took ev erything. That™s 
what happened to  it.  

Q: Are there any -- any memo ries or thoughts about 
England
 that we haven™t 
discussed that you™d like to share before I have you leaving? 
A: I -- I think that the most impressive th
ing that -- that I have emotionally is a 
heritage of a treme
ndous love of the 
United States
 
of America
, which I learned 
from my  parents and the gratefulness of bei
ng here and that this truly is a land of 
salvation. 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
26
Q: But when you reflect 
back on your time in 
England
, is there anything th at you 
haven™t me ntioned that you -- you want to talk about? 
A: There was -- while I was there -- no, I 
-- I -- I was happy in the country. You 
know, I was -- we picked berries and I ha
d friends and I was all right. I mean, I -- 

my parents wrote to me, you know, what -- 
I think -- I think I was a very, in those 
days, a very secure child. 
That changed later in the 
United Sta tes
. 
Q: What were your expectations of 
America
? 
A: This -- I don™t mean this with any sense 
of -- of -- of prejudice, it™s just a child, 
but I remember it -- my storybooks in -- in 
Germany
 were that blacks were in 
Africa
 and wore grass skirts. And I remember
 the first time I saw -- well, now we 
say African American -- black on the str
eet, I like gothysterical andwas saying, 
why aren™t they wearing -- to my mother
 -- why aren™t they wearing long grass 
skirts? Who are these people? And I think my  expectations were that I wouldn™t be 

separated from my  parents any mo re and th at
 I would be with them, and that I knew 
that they would have to wo rk very, very ha
rd  and I was told I would have to do my  

share, which I did insofar as that I always
 -- I always worked ve
ry hard, but without 
resentment, just like they did, to  make a life.  
Q: Where did you land when  
you came to this country ? 
A: In
 New York. 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
27
Q: And what were your fi
rst impressions of the 
United States
? 
A: The very , very, very tall buildings in 
New York City,
 and the noise. And we had 
had a -- a wonderful journey. It was over Chri
stma s. It took ab out eight days to -- to 
cross. We had escort ships that -- agains
t the submarines, I guess. And I rememb er 
Christmas on -- on -- on board the ship with
 m -- a beautiful Christmas tree in the 
middle of the dining room and -- and mu si
c and dancing and my  poor mo th er was 
seasick the whol-whole journe
y. And I had a beautiful, black velv et dress with 
smocking th at my  grandmother had made fo
r me and that was like the last glory 
days, you know, because my father kept sa
ying, you better eat up, we better eat -- 
eat -- and -- and -- and -- and enjoy ourselve
s because it™s not going to be like this, 
you know, when  we get to 
America
. That I remember. 
Q: Were there other Jewish re
fugees on the ship with you? 
A: I really don™t remember. There must ha
ve been. I have a -- a printout, a copy, a 
microfiche copy of th e passengers on the sh
ip, cause a friend of mine was doing li -- 
research and that she got -- she found. And there were quite a few -- I didn™t -- I 
don™t remember any of them, but I know fro
m the list that they 
-- the ship was filled 
with refugees. 
Q: Where did your family ri -- initially 
settle when  they  came to this country ? 
A: 
New York
, because my uncle ha -- had -- wa
s there, my mother™s brother.  

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
28
Q: And what were your living c
onditions like when  you arrived? 
A: Even worse than in 
London
. We again lived in so meb
ody™s apartment house i-in 
the 
Bronx,
 in somebody™s bedroom. And my fa
ther got a job in a meat packing 
plant carrying ice on his back and my  mo th
er scrubbed floors. And -- but that only 
lasted unt-until April. And my fa -- my fath
er just couldn™t handle it any more, his 
back was breaking. And my  mo ther had a first cousin in
 Washington
 
D.C.
, and 
they -- by the name of 
Rosenfeld
, and they -- the wo
man was her cousin, 
Regi
 and 
they got a job -- her husband™s name was 
Sigmund
, he got a job for 
my father at the 
Hub 
Furn iture comp any, setting 
up furniture in the ware
house. Furniture came 
knocked down -- cause he work ed there, t
oo. So that™s -- we went -- we went to 
Washin gton, D.C.
 and lived in their house on 
New York
 Avenue
 
because they 
took in refugees. They had 
one of these big, old brow
nstones and -- and ev erybody 
work ed an d there was an old grandmother name of 
Bertha,
 she -- she did the 
cooking and we again lived
 in one room, and I, you know, was enrolled in 
elementary school in 
Washin gton.
 I™d been in school in 
New York,
 too, in 
elementary school. And there I was in a 
spec ial cla ss for  re
fugee children, you 
know, for English. But by the time I got to
 wa -- by the time in April when I came 
to 
Wash ington, 
I was in a regular class. And my 
parents -- my mother got a job at 
the 
Toleman 
laundry sewing buttons on shirts 
[indecipherable]
 steam laundry, 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
29
cause in those days buttons were still sewn
 on the laundried sh
irts, and my father 
worked there at the 
Hub
, and they  wo rked  six days a week and this 
Regi
 had two 
sons. On e was my  age, one was older and I 
would go to school, you know, walk to 
school with them. And th
en they joined like a -- there was a club here,
 Verein,
 of 
German Jews in
 Wash ington,
 my  parents met those people and I met other children 
and life started. 
Q: Did any relief organizations help your fami ly? 
A: No.  
Q: How were you r
eceived by Americans in general?
 Did they ask you about your 
experiences in 
Germany
? 
A: I don™t remember that. I don™t rememb
er -- I -- I know that I so desperately 
wanted only to be an
 American, that I tried very hard
. And I think I mu st have had a 
British accent, they tell me I had a British 
accent at tha -- at that point, and I -- 
that™s what I wanted, you know, my pare
nts, you know -- you know, I was -- I was a 
child. I was sent that first summ
er already to camp la -- C amp 
Louise
, through the 
Strauss 
family, where the refugee children were
 sent for free. And they so mehow 
found some shorts and some clothes fo
r me and that was my first w o nderful 
memory, was to be for three weeks at Camp
 Louise
, which is the dearest thing to 
my  heart. And both  my  daughters were counselors there and now my  granddaughter 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin

is going to Camp
 Louise
 because of the generosity of wh at the 
S-Strauss 
family did 
for poor children. 
Q: Was it easy for you to make
 friends in this country?  
A: I™ve -- I™ve always had friends, I -- I -- no,
 I didn 't find it difficult. I really had no 
feelings of -- of prejudice in the 
United States
. I have -- I did not go through -- 
through any that I can remember. 

Q: Was there anything that was a partic
ularly difficult adjustment for you?  
A: I think the most difficult thing was that
 now they talk abou
t latchkey children. 
My mo ther and father work ed six days a 
week and I came home by myself after s -- 

after school, because within 
a year they had saved enough money t-to -- we moved 
to -- above a grocery store further up 
New York 
Avenue, Jewish family owned, it 
was one of those Mo m and Pop 
stores and we lived in an
 apartment upstairs and of 
course we took in a roomer in the apartm
ent. And I had to come home every single 
day by my self and I was 10 years old, you 
know, at that point. And that was hard. 
As -- and being an only child
 and again, I™ve always read
 it -- read a lot and I -- and 
I liked to draw and I liked to -- and I was 
not allowed to bring 
other children in, you 
know, because I was by my -- 
you know, by myself and so 
that™s what I remember 
from that life. 

Q: Were you able to keep in
 touch with your family in 
Europe
? 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin

31
A: No, no. My -- my grandm
other -- my  grandmother -- the uncle was sent to the -- 
Theresienstadt
 and he died there. And my  grandmother was sent to 
Auschwitz
 and 
was gassed. And there was no mo re news 
since after the war started, after u -- 
United States
 war started. And then after the wa
r they got a telegram from the Red 
Cross, you know, that
 she had died in 
Auschwit z
. And I have looked up the records 
at the Holocaust Museum and have the c
opies of the reports in -- fro m the books 
that the Germans kept of their demise. 
Q: You were a student in this country duri
ng the war -- a good part of the war. Do 
you remember how the war was reported by 
the media, or discussed in schools? I 
mean, in what ways did the war touch your life as a child? 

A: I think the war touched me insofar as 
that I was always afraid that we™d get 
bombed in 
America
. And I -- I was -- I was afraid. 
We™d have blackouts, you know 
and there were wardens, you know, and I -- I th
ink I have -- I wa -- just plain afraid.  
Q: Do you remember when  
Germ any
 attacked the 
Soviet Union
? 
A: No, I don™t. Well, I remember that -- th
at in the beginning the Germans and the 
Soviets were -- were allies, and then -- 
and then, of course, then the Russians 
became our allies. I mean, y
ou know, but I remember, y ou 
know, that -- that bit of 
history.

Q: When  you th ink back about
 your first year in the 
United States
, what comes to 
your mind? 
A: Trying to adap t to school. Trying to  adap
t to learning. Trying to adapt to -- to -- 
told not to comp
lain because that -- that grandm
other who ran th
e house there, 
really gave us very, very, very poor 
food. And wanting clothing like the other 
children and not having it. And also nice 
times. I was -- I was given 10 cents to go 
to the movies on Saturd ay, and those were
 the days where there was like the double 
features and the cartoons and th
e news. You know, adjusting to 
America
.

 A
 and I -- I wanted to have
 you reflect back on -- on 
the year 1941, before the 
United States
 got involved 
in the war. Is there anything 
that stands out in your 
mind about -- about that year
? W-Were you concerned -- 
overly concerned about what was going on in 
Europe
 or did you kind of take it in 
stride? 
A: I think I was 11 years old and I was a ch 
-- again, I was living a child™s life and it 
was -- and we were moving t-to -- for the 
first time in what, two years, two and a 
half years, where we had an apartment of 
our own, even though I still had to sleep 
with my parents because the other bedroom
 was with a roomer, a -- where we had a 
roomer. But I rememb er the rash -- ration book -- books, and I remember the 
blackouts and you had to 
pull your window shades 
down, you know, window 
shades. And I rememb er the headlines and 
the fears that -- that people had, and 
that™s about all that I rememb er. 

Q: Do you reme mb er what you we
re doing wh en news came out about
 Pearl 
Harbor 
being attacked?

we had a radio where we didn™t have -- we
ll, nobody had televisions, there was -- 
there was no television. And I think it was 
the constant -- the constant talk, and -- 
and the fear and -- and the fear of that bom
bs might be coming, but I think that also 
I -- I -- I -- I -- I think that
 because the conversation was about my  grandmother, my  
uncle and the cousins and all the other relatives in -- in 
Germany
, and what was 
happening and there was a newspaper called ﬁ
The Aufbau
.ﬂ I don™t know if it™s 
still in existence. It™s -- m
eans the rebuilding. 
But people got the news, and that was 
really where -- where the news came about wh at was happening in  
Germany
, and 
everybody subscribed to 
it. It was printed in 
New York
. And -- and there was a-
always the worry. That™s what I remember
 was tenseness and worry. And that it was 
wartime an d -- and listening to the news ev
ery night. And I think that that™s what 
mo st p e o p le reme mb er ab ou t 
that time. Because I had no brothers and sisters and 
knew no one who was a -- well, th ere was te
rrible worry becaus
e my mother™s -- 
had a sister by that time, whose husband -- his name was 
Jacob -- Jakob
 who died 
in the prison in 
Aug sburg
 from a heart attack. He never 
even got to the camp s, he -- 
and she came via 
Spain
 eventually, to 
America
. And my mother and father 
introduced her to a widower who she th
en married, and lived
 in -- also in 
Washin gton, D.C.
. And her son had been part of the 
Kindertransport
 when he

was 14, he went to 
Eng l and
 on the 
Kindertransport. 
And 
Ken
 -- his name used to 
be 
Helmut
, but they  always chan ge the names wh
en  you went in the army . Then he 
went to the tank corps with th
e Brits. And terrible worry about 
Ken
 -- you know, 
Helmut
, wh at was happening to  him. But th
at was my  only big connection with 
somebody who would be in the service as
 -- as -- as a personal worry, you know, 
that way.  
Q: The kinds of info rmation you got from ﬁ
The Aufbau,ﬂ
 and the kinds of 
information you got from the radi
o, was there much overlap? 
A: No, I -- I -- I think ﬁ
The Aufbauﬂ
 info rmation was mo re what was happening in 
-- in -- in 
Germany
 and everywhere else, like with
 -- with the camps, and with -- 
with the -- with the carnage that was goi
ng -- going on, and probab ly about how the 
United States
 wasn™t doing anything. And from
 the newspapers I -- I really 
remember more when I was 14 
-- well, fort -- a -- when I was 15 the war ended, like 
13 and 14, I reme mb er, you know, reading 
the news and -- and -- and when things 
looked bad being sad and -- 
and getting excited. You know
, a child™s attitude is 
different than an adult™s. And again I th
ink it made a difference, the stress level 

because we didn't have any relatives th-that were fighting.  
Q: So when you reflect back on the year
s of 1942 and ™43 and ™44, what comes to 
your mind? What was happening in your life?  

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
36
A: Well, what was happening in  my  life, by -- by that time -- by the time I was 13 
they had saved en ough money that they
 bought a house with a thousand dollar 
deposit, for seven or eight thousand dollars on 
Dellafield 
Place
 
in the upper 
north west. And I was junior high 
school and I was in the ju -- 
JCC 
swim team and I 
was taking art lessons and I was -- I was a ve ry busy -- very busy person. And, you 

know, I was going to school and I had -- 
and I had friends. And like all teenagers 
was very involved with my self. My pare
nts were going to the Americanization 
school in 1944 becau
se they got their c itizenship in 
1945, which was a tr -- and 
during th at time -- I rememb er one time Mrs. 
Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt 
was at 
the 
JCC
 and my mother, she must -- must have
 been the reception for German club, 
you know, the re-refugee club. And my  mo
ther wa -- came -- went there and sh e 
came home and she just couldn™t get over that
 the president™s wife, like the queen, 
should shak e a comm oner™s hand. And it was -- it -- only in 
America
, only in 
America
. But it was really such a glory an
d just a thankfulness to be in 
America
. 
That was a constant refrain. And I would only
 talk English to my parents. I really 
was nasty. I -- I -- I wanted -- I wanted so
 much to be an American, and I didn™t 
even want to, like go out w
ith the sons of -- of -- of -- of the other German Jews 
because I -- I was -- I was a f -- foolish ki
d in that way, where I -- but you know, 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
37
there was -- my parents would talk Germ
an to me and I would only an swer in 
English. And I really lost a 
great deal of the language.  
Q: What was reaction of y
our family when -- when 
Roosevelt
 died? 
A: My mother and my father just cried 
and cried and cried. He was the hero, th e 
great hero. And I don™t think 
th at they knew how -- wh ich no
w is in history, that he 
could have -- he could have saved milli
ons and millions of 
people -- not millions, 
but he could have done something so th
at the carnage wouldn™t have happened. 
Q: Do you reme mb er reading about the thous
and, or just less than a t h ousand Jews 
coming to 
Oswego
 for haven? 
A: No. 
Q: How did you learn that the war was over in 
Europe? 
A: Headlines in the newspapers, it was on th
e radio. It was yelled out on th e street, 
it™s over. I remember g o  -- being -- going 
outside and yelling and screaming, it™s 
over, it™s over, it™s over. And th en of course th
e hope that it would be over as far -- 
and then  wh at -- shortly then, we bombed 
Japan.
 I forget how m -- it wasn™t that 
long a time and then that was over.  
Q: What efforts did your family make
 to find relatives an d friends in 
Europe
? 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
38
A: They -- they knew right after the war, 
and even during it that people that were 
the closest were all -- all were -- were kille
d. All were gassed, all w ere, insofar as 
family that -- that was left in
 Europe. 
Q: You said that they
 knew during the war? 
A: Well, not -- not really, th
ey guessed, they guessed.  
Q: When  did you begin to realize the full extent of the genocid e? 
A: I think right -- I think when the telegr
ams came from the Red Cross that -- that 
the family was -- was gone, and of cour
se in the newspapers, the American 
newspapers, when you started 
seeing th e pictures of the camps and the liberation of 
the camps, that™s when th
e realities really stru ck. 
Q: During this time that you were in the 
States
, up thro ugh th e war years, nobody 
asked you about you
r experiences in 
Germany
? 
A: I don™t remember.  

Q: Did you follow the 
Nuremberg 
trials? 
A: Pardon me? 

Q: Did you follow the 
Nuremberg
 trials? 
A: Yes, I did. 
Q: Did you feel justice was done? 
A: I feel justice was d one, yes.

Q: Did you follow 
the events in 
Palestine
? 
A: N-No, I really was not that concerned with 
Israel, 
with
 Palestine. 
Q: In the years immed iately after the 
war, what was happening in your life? So 
you™re now 15 years old and the war is over. 
In those first few post-war years, what 
was happening in your life? 

A: I was -- because we were poor, I was alrea
dy working as a salesg irl in -- in -- in -
- in a second rate department store, lower 
7
th
 Street. 
When I was 14, I ha -- I got a 
work  permit so that I could have clothes, 
cause I wanted to be dressed like the other 
girls and the only way to get it was to wo
rk . And I was brought up that it was my  
job as much, to help with 
the family. In other words, 
I made the beds and started 
dinner for when my parents came home,
 because by that time my  mo ther was 
working in small fur ma
nufacturing comp any called 
Louies™ Furs
, and sh e became 
the forelady fo-for making th
e linings for -- for the fur co
ats. And my father -- oh, 
my father had a -- with his friend they
 opened -- they bought a delicatessen on 
Sheridan 
Street, which lasted -- th at was when
 I was 12 and 13 and my  mo ther then 
went to work there. And that
 lasted about two and a half years, and she realized that 
I was being left alone, because it was a da
y and seven day a we
ek proposition. And 
because my father -- my -- my
 father™s sense of values 
were not too good. He had 
trouble with --with what was right and wh at
 was wrong. He -- he actually, I think --

friend of ours who had met 
him and was a me dical person
 said he™d become a -- 
like a psychopath. And this was -- this was 
-- a lot of it was due to his experien ces 
at the camp s in 
Dachau
 and -- and his 
[indecipherable]
 and losing everything. He 
never really adjusted. He didn™t learn En
glish that well. My 
mo th er -- my  mo th er 
learned English very well, could spell. 
I mean, she had an accent, but could read, 
write, spell, but he -- he never -- he 
never adju sted that
 well, as I said. 
Q: So you were in school 
and you were working. Wh at
 about your social life? 
A: That™s when I -- the rejection started. 
That was when, because I went to a school 
called 
Roosevelt
 high school, where all the -- it wa
s about 80 percen t Jewish kids, 
70 percent en -- and it was sororities, frate
rnities which were really outlawed. And I 
wanted to be part of, and I didn™t have
 the clothing, and I didn -- and I tried too 
hard, and that™s where I was the refugee.
 That™s where I was not treated right. 
Because I had the brains, but not the -- the 
-- the moxie. I didn™t -- I didn™t know 
how to be part of the American kids. I 
didn™t know, cause I was too European and 
too -- tried too hard. And that™s really -- fro
m the Jewish kids is where the rejection 
came.  
Q: Did you and your family 
main tain any level of religious observance when you 
came to this country ? 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
41
A: Oh yes. We -- my parents joined 
B™Nai Israel
 synagogue and -- which is a 
Conservative synagogue, and th ey  did no
t -- she did not keep kosher any mo re, 
because she didn't have the money for two se
ts of dishes, or the kosher meat. And -- 
but it was never -- the cooking was always as if it was kosher, you know, no 
mixing. And all the holidays -- and we al
ways had Friday  night -- Friday night 
services, you know. And my  mo ther -- my  mother was really the religious one. 

There was -- she was always with the pray
er book, she read 
-- they both read 
Hebrew fluently. And all the 
holidays were kept. And I th
ink it was -- it -- it was -- I 
was brought up in -- in -- in a relig ious home
 where it was always as -- as -- as soon 
as the repatriation mo ney comes from 
Germany
, as soon as we get money, we™re 
going to  buy dishes and we™re gonna -- we™r
e gonna go back to 
keep ing kosher and 
then maybe she could stop work ing. And unf
ortunately, my mother
 died when I was 
23 years old, of breast cancer. So, they had 
just gotten -- they ha
dn™t even gotten the 
monies yet, and I -- so she never got to -- 
to reap the benefit. But she felt God was 
punishing her, and made a prom
ise to God that if she got 
well she would go back to 
being more religious. She -- she -- she was 
truly, truly a very deeply observant 
religious person. My father not as much, 
he -- I think he could have cared less. 
Q: How much education -- how much fo rmal 
education did you get in this country? 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
42
A: I, of course, graduated high school. And 
then I had -- I went to college for three 
years and didn™t finish.  

Q: You got married? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Can you tell me 
about your husband? 
A: I met my husband when  I was 16 and he
 was 17, and he is American born from a 
family that™s been -- came from 
R u ssia
 and 
Austria. 
Mo th er 
Austria  
fa -- in the 
middle 1800™s, so they™re real 
ipsy-pipsy
 Americans. And he was a consulting 
engineer, electrical enginee
r, and we got married when  I was 21 and he was 22. And 
he went to  school at night to finish his 
degree, and we both work ed very, very  hard 
and built up all -- also . 

Q: And you mentioned children? 

A: I have tw o daughters. One is 45 and th
e other is 40, and th ey™re both -- they -- 
which I never -- I never realized it but they
 tell me that the Holocaust was always 
like over their heads, that I kept it -- that 
I talked about it. I™ve 
talked about the six 
million, and I™ve talked about their heritage 
as Jews and that we must never, never, 
never forget that they
™re -- their Ju daism.  
Q: What did you do for your pr
ofessional career as an adult? 
A: I am a interior designer and I ha
d my  own business for 30 years.

Q: Did you ever return 
to your hometown in 
Germany
? 
A: Yes. I went back to -- my husband was 
a delegate to International Engineering 
Council in 
Denmark
 when I was what -- 19 -- 19 thir 
-- when I was 35,
 so, in 1965 
-- ™64. And I went with him and he wanted 
to  see where I was born and I didn't want 
to go but he insisted
. So I went back to 
Augsburg
 then. And my father™s lawyer 
welcomed us and his wife took us si
ghtseeing and I rememb ered everything, I 
remembered every single str
eet. I remembered everything 
til we got to the house in 
the suburbs there, and there I got hysteric
al and broke up, and -- and -- and -- and I 
just couldn™t stay there. And we got out of 
Germa ny
, fast. 
Q: How were you treated by the Germans while you were there? 
A: Well, the -- really, the only -- as a ma
tter o f fact, w-we were driving. We had 
come down the 
Romantic
 Road through 
Dinkelsbühl
 an-and -- and that whole 
Romantic
 Road . And it was a very rainy ni
ght and we were driving into 
Augsburg
. 
This was beginning June, and we were lo
st. And there was a guy riding a bicycle 
next to th e car and I asked him -- I wa -- I was looking fo r the 
[indecipherable]
 
hotel. And he looked  in the 
car, this is really weird -- 
I mean, I am now what, 34 - 
35 years old, and he looked in
 the car and he said to me, he said, were you -- was 
your name 
Brigitte Mandle
? And I said yes. And -- you know, in German. He said, 
I know you. I used to deliver the mattre
sses for your father. Follow me. And he took

us to the hotel. So -- and my father™s
 lawyer, who had been wo rkin g in the 
underground all those years and work ing fo
-for -- for the Brits and became the first 
mayor of 
Aug sburg
 and had saved the records of the Jewish people -- 
Q: You mean post-war mayor? 
A: Yes, post-war -- war mayor. He -- he and 
his wife treated us royally. And that™s 
really, you know, the only Ge
rmans, you know, that we 
met. We only stayed like 
two days. 
Q: Are you involved with
 any Holo caust related gr
oups or organizations? 
A: No, I™m not. I™m just a volunteer at 
the mu seum, where I do translations from 
German into English.  

Q: What special some thing do you bring to
 yo u r  w o rk  at th e 
museum, that™s the 
result of your experiences? 
A: I think it™s what the mu seum has done for me. The museum has made me 

recognize the importance of 
the Holo caust, and that it can never happen again and 
that the world has to know. And I think I™m
 one of the greatest spokesp eople for the 
mu seum, that everybody should see the 
mu seum. And the mu seum has made me 
realize the heritage that I have and how im
portant it is for me to remember, and my 
children, and everyone else. It™s done mo re 
for me than I have ever done fo r the 
mu seu m. 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin

45
Q: Were there any special mo ments or e
xperiences that you™ve had at the mu seum 
that you™d care to share? 
A: No, I --I -- I really just
 go and do my work, and -- 
Q: Tell me a -- a little 
bit about your work. 
A: Oh ma -- my work? I -- I think -- I thi
nk the biggest one was I did a series of 
translations of the letters during -- you mentioned the 
Nuremberg
 trials, of the 
inmates of -- of -- that they 
wrote home to their -- to their wives, to their mistresses, 
to their children, and how th
ey never, ever, ever mention,
 not in one single letter, 
I™m so sorry, or I -- I sh -- I wish I coul
d ch ange things. They  only wrote about -- 
now, I realize they must have been censo
red, these letters, but they wrote in the 
typical German letters, quoted from 
[indecipherable]
 and from 
Schiller
 and about 
life. Life is beautiful and I hope the fl
owers are blooming in  springtime and I hope 
you have enough to eat, because their monies
 were taken away and their substances 
and their -- the families, and it was -- 
and how much I miss 
you and how much I 
love you and -- but no remo rse and no -- noth
ing of the past, just
 worry about their 
families. And th at impressed me
, that I was -- that I was ab
le to see these letters and 
-- and to translate them. And about the 
Saint Louis
. All the correspondence from 
the people, the telegrams and -- and -- and 
the letters that people have saved from 
what went on in  that 
Sa int Lo uis
, and the -- and desperation of these people that -- I 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
46
think that that™s the -- the mo
st amazing thing th at I am privileged enough to help in 
bringing this to the world, 
you know, into English. And 
ha -- I™ll add this, that I™m 
amazed that I™m able to do 
the translations, because I only had up to a third or 
fourth  grade education in German. But 
it -- it -- now I can™t do -- I don™t do the 
technical things, they have other people that 
do the technical. But I 
am able to -- to 
really, really do this and it™s like -- it™s like
 a gift and -- and because of that I™m able 
to speak German again, ev
en though I -- I speak no 
German with -- with this 
translation, but it seems to have gone from 
my  head  to my  mouth. So  this is, you 
know, an advantage, because it™s a 
language to know, like any language. 

Q: Do you speak publicly 
about your experien ces? 
A: The only public speaking I™ve done 
was I did a first person, in November. 
Q: You mentioned grandchild
ren before. What have yo
u told them about your -- 
your childhood? 

A: I™ve appeared in the fi
rst grade for both my gran
ddaughters, the ones -- local 
ones, with -- like a -- I -- I happen to ha
ve -- that™s the only thing I have from 
Germany
 are two 
kiddush 
cups. So I took the 
kiddush
 cups to show that this is 
what life used to be, that we were able 
to bring things over a
nd talked about having 
to escape. This is -- you know
, an-and about being born in 
Germany
, and about
 
Hitler
, keeping it mild, but you know, I talked
 with the teacher. But they don™t -- 

 
Interview with Brigitte Freidin  
 
March 12, 2001 
 

 
 
47
they -- they don™t really ask me that 
many questions. My grandchildren are -- are 
age three to 10.  
Q: So anything that we haven™t talked abou
t that you™d like to add before we finish 
the interview? Anything th
at we haven™t covered? 
A: No, I think we™ve pretty 
well -- pretty well covered my  life. I -- I find the older I 
ge -- I get, the more important I think it is
, the reality of -- that the world cannot 
forget, and that I wish that people would 
just care more for each other and -- and 
love each other and all that, you know, sort 
of thing, and -- and not have prejudice, 
not have prejudice. Have
 no peck ing orders. 
Q: I™d like to thank you 
for doing the interview 
and this concludes the 
United 
States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Brigitte Freidin. 
Thank you.
