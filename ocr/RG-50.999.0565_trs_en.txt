J ulie Keefer was  bor n J ula Weinstock  to J ewis h par ents in Lwow, Poland, on Apr il
 
19, 1941. 
This  photograph of J ulie is  the only one that exis ts  fr om her time in hiding.
 
 
On this  map of Poland, the arrow points  to Lwow, where J ulie was  bor n.
 
 
In this  photogr aph, J ulie's  father, Herman, is the man farthes t to the left in the back  row and 
her  mother , Sala, is the wom an farthes t to the left in the front row. J ulie's  parents als o would have a 

younger  daughter nam ed Tola.
 
 
In J une
 
1941, Germ ans  oc c upied Lwow. German and Uk r ainian author ities  for c ed all J ews  
into a ghetto, including Julie and her fam ily. On this  map of Lwow, the white arr ow points  to the location 

of the ghetto. J ulie's  grandfather  was  arres ted and made a forc ed laborer. After working at a lim e 
quar ry they m oved 
him  to J anows ka labor c am p, indic ated here with the red arr ow. He es c aped this  
labor  c amp in 1942. Then lear ning that the Lwow ghetto would be des troyed, he helped J ulie, her  

par ents, and her sis ter  hide in a bunk er in a near by for es t with 30 other J ews  from Lwow. He then 

2 
 
m oved J ulie and her s is ter  to live with his  non
-
J ewis h fr iend, Luc ia, bec aus e he fear ed the girls ' cr ying 
would give their hiding spot away. In Marc h
 
1942, the Germ ans deported thous ands  of J ews  who had 
r em ained in the Lwow ghetto to the Belzec  killing c enter. They boarded tr ains  fr om the Kleptar ow train 
s tation indic ated her e with the blue arr ow.
 
 
This  photograph s hows  Luc ia Nowic ka on the left and Aizik on the r ight. Aizik as s umed the 
identity of Luc ia's  hus band, and they intr oduced J ulie
 
and her s is ter  as her niec es. Aizik tr aveled bac k  
and for th between Luc ia's  hous e and the for est to help the people in hiding there. At one point Luc ia 
was  ar res ted by Sec ur ity Polic e. With Luc ia in pr is on, Aizik hid Julie's  s ister in a Catholic  c hildren'
s 
hom e. When Luc ia was  releas ed fr om pris on, s he returned home and c ar ed for  J ulie. One day, while 

Aiz ik was  vis iting Luc ia in town, German author ities  dis c over ed the bunker  in the for est and killed 
ever yone hidden there, inc luding J ulie's par ents . At the end of the war, as Soviet tr oops  approac hed, 

the Germans evac uated the Catholic  c hildr en's home wher e J ulie's s is ter  lived. Aizik and J ulie wer e 
unable to find J ulie's s is ter  after this .
 
 
This  photograph s hows  Julie, the older  gir l on the left, Aizik, Luc ia, and J ulie's  fr iend in a 
Dis plac ed Per s ons  Camp after the war . Aizik s ent Julie to Am eric a in 1948, hoping to join her  later. 
J ulie lived in a c hildr en's home for s ix year s  until a c ouple fr om Cleveland, Ohio, adopted her. Aizik 
m arried Luc ia and they eventually imm igr ated to the United States and s ettled in New York.
 
         
 
Following J ulie's  adoption by Thea and Fr ed Klestadt at age 16 in 1957 and her graduation 
fr om  high s c hool, J ulie attended Oberlin College in Ohio, wher e s he m ajored in Frenc h with
 
m inor s in 
Spanis h and art. While at Oberlin J ulie met Larr y Keefer whom she married on J une 24, 1962, 54 year s

> > Bill Bens on:  J ulie, thank  you s o m uc h for joining us  and for  your willingnes s  to s har e this  hour with 
us . It's  a s hor t hour. You have s o muc h to tell us so we'r e going to start r ight away if that's ok with you. 
 
 
J ulie, Wo
r ld War II began with Germany and Russ ia's  invas ion of Poland in Septem ber
 
1939. 
You wer e bor n in April
 
1941, after the war had begun. The c ity wher e you and your  family lived was  
under Soviet oc c upation at that time. I know you know very little about your
 
family and their lives  pr ior 
to your birth. To the extent that you c an, s hare with us  just a little bit about your fam ily in the years  pr ior  

to your birth.
 
> > Julie Keefer:  Well, my father was  a tinsm ith. But the Rus s ians c alled him a plum ber. My mother  
was  

a Jewis h oper a s inger
 b
ut at that time the Rus s ians  c ons ider ed that to be a very m iddle c las s  kind of 
thing, s o s he wor ked in a factor y.
 
 
I have a photo of where we lived before we wer e all for c ed to go to the ghetto. The woman 
who s aved our lives , and
 
wher e m y gr andfather lived firs t, was  outs ide of the ghetto. She r an like a taxi 
c ab c ompany, s he and her  hus band. But her  husband was  taken away.
 
She los t her  hous e bec aus e the 
Rus s ians  had hugely extensive taxation. And if you owned a dwelling, you had to pay a gr eat deal and 
s he c ouldn't affor d to k eep it. So as the war went on, s he worked as a live
-
in hous ekeeper for  a retired 
Polis h engineer and his  wife.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Back  to a little bit about the early
 
--
 
befor e the war  began in your  fam ily, in the ear ly 
year s . You mentioned your  father  was  a tins mith, though the Rus s ians c alled him  a plumber , and your  
m other  an opera s inger. Ther e's a par tic ular s ong that evokes  a mem ory of your  m other . Can y
ou tell 
us  a little bit about that?
 

> > J ulie Keefer:  
You k now, I r emember almost nothing about m y father . He's  a c ipher , kind of, to me. 
But m y m other , what I r em em ber  about m y m other , was  that s he had this  beautiful s opr ano voic e. And 

when I hear
 
--
 
I c an't even pronounc e it. I'm  s or ry. It's a Jewis h lullaby. It always  rem inds  me of her. 
She m ust have sung that to m e when I was  little. And I remember that s he was  s oft and c ozy and 
s m elled m ilky.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Bill Bens on:  As you will explain to us  later , J ulie, your  gr andfather was  very es s ential, total
ly 
es s ential, to your s ur vival. What was  his  oc c upation at that tim e? 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  He was
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'll m ove your  s weater , if you don't mind. Ther e we go.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Sorr y for the str ipteas e, folks.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  
Ok. Anyway. My grandfather was  an importer  of fruits  and vegetables . He was  a 
m er c hant. And, of c ourse, he c ouldn't do that. J ews  wer e not allowed to be in anything. So he would 
exis t however he c ould.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  He s ent a c ouple of his  c hildr en to the United States before the war . Is  that right?
 
> > J ulie Keefer:   No
. H
e is  the oldes t of s ix c hildren. His  father  dec ided to s end the two girls , the only 
gir ls  in the family to A m er ic a.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before the war .
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Long befor e. Bec aus e that was  the tim e of the pogr oms . And he was  c onc er ned for  

their safety.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Nazi Germ any turned on the Soviet Union in J une
 
1941, jus t m onths  after  your  bir th. 
Within days  the c ity of Lwow was  oc cupied by the Nazis  and your  family was  for
c ed into a ghetto. Tell 
us  what that meant for your fam ily, inc luding your gr andfather, Aizik, for them to move you s o quick ly 

into the ghetto.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  It m eant
 
--
 
m y gr andfather, I gues s  today we would c all him  ver y s treet smart. And he 
and m y f
ather got together  and built a s ec ret c ompartm ent in his  bar n, by his  hous e in the ghetto. And 
we all, m y m other , m y father  and I went into this  one kind of tiny s pac e that was  oc c upied by many 
other people. I don't know who. I don't rem ember. My grandfather didn't make it in tim e s o he was  
c aptured and taken to his  fir st labor c am p. And that was  J aktorow. The whole c amp got typhoid. So the 

whole c amp was  evac uated to hospitals , even J ews , but the J ews wer e suppos ed to c om e back  by 

4 
 
tr ains to J aktor ow again 
but s om ehow they wor ked it out so that my grandfather wound up s om ewhere 
bac k  in the ghetto.
 
 
So my firs t hiding plac e
 
--
 
bas ic ally ther e wer e three. But my first one, and I was  very 
young
 
--
 
s ome of what you're hearing, I was  told. Som e exis ts  in my gr andfather's diar y. Very little do I 
r em em ber. But ther e ar e glim ps es  and little piec es  that I r emember. Us ually kind of by s mell 

or
 
--
 
es pec ially by s mell and vis ion, by the s ens es , and touc h.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know if other members  of your  extended family were als o forc ed into the ghetto 
at that time? 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  I don't k
now. I would imagine. My unc le 
--
 
on that pic ture that you s aw befor e, my 
unc le was  the one in the Polis h Arm y uniform , on the right. And his wife was  underneath. I don't even 

k
now his  name. I know that my unc le and aunt had two boys  who wer e muc h older than I. I don't k now 
whether  his  wife fled to the ghetto. I know he didn't. I don't know. I really don't.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your gr andfather  was  taken by the Nazis  to J a
nows ka, forc ed labor  c amp, 
wher e 
thousands  of J ews  wer e killed. Do you know how your  gr andfather ended up in J anows ka?  And tell us  
about that place. It was  a horr ific  c am p.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Yes. You know, s om etim es we in the United States know about m any of the c am
ps  
that wer e liberated by the allies  but we don't know muc h about thos e that were liber ated by the 
Rus s ians . This was  one that was  liberated by the Rus s ians .
 
 
It was  a huge death c amp. If you pas s ed m uster, if you were a s tr ong man, you were taken for  
for c
ed labor. My gr andfather 's job was  s tone c utting, c utting s tones and c arr ying them, c utting stones  
and c arrying them. After  he los t 100
 
pounds, he was  told that he was  going to be s hot the next day. 
Bec aus e those who c ouldn't work  were either tak en to
 
--
I  
forgot what they c alled it but this  kind of, like, 
huge, huge ditc h in the bac k  and s hot or they wer e s ent to
 
--
 
us ually not to Belzec . It took
 
tim efor  
tr ans portation and s o forth. He found out he was  suppos ed to be s hot and he dec ided to es c ape. 
There's
 
a song c alled
 
--
 
"Fr eedom's  just another name for nothing left to los e." So he dec ided to esc ape 
bec aus e he had nothing left to los e.
 
 
J anowska was  on the top of a hill and it was  huge.When the c enturies were opening the 
door s  for new pr is oner s, he dec ided to jump down
 
--
 
ther e was  a huge hill. He kind of r an and jum ped, 
whatever , down this  hill, ac r os s the s tr eet, and went
 
--
 
ac r oss  the str eet was  a huge ditc h. At the bottom 
were s om e r ailr oad track s . He managed to get down and jum p down on that ditc h. And as he was  
jum ping, he was  s hot in the hand. But he m anaged to get ac ros s  the track s . And then the train c ame. 
But the train was  amm unitions  tr ain, whic h means it was  c arr ying ar ms of all kinds . And if you s hot 
them, what do you think happened?  Mm
-
hmm. 
There would be a m as s explos ion. And he ran with the 
tr ain for a while.
 
 
Now, this  was  in Novem ber. In Poland it was  very, ver y c old and s nowing. He was  wearing a 
thin c onc entr ation c am p unifor m and bar efoot becaus e, of c ours e, all of their c lothes and eve
rything 
were taken away and he was  given wooden s hoes  that didn't fit bec aus e he had big feet. So ther e he 
was  barefoot, bleeding, cold, hot with fever and he m anaged to get to a woods  nearby. 
 
 
Then he went to the c loses t town and he m et a Polis h peas ant,
 
Mr .
 
Bereczki. And m y r egr et to 
this  day is  that s omehow we wer e
 
not able to get Mr . 
Berec zki on the wall of the r ighteous amongst 
nations . I wis h we had. Bec aus e Mr.
 
Berec zki
 
--
 
my gr andfather had rem oved his  J ewis h s tars  from  his  
jacket and pants.
 
 
B y th
e way, es pec ially for thos e of you who are younger, two things . One is , the only s ur vivor s  
who have number s  ar e sur vivors  from Ausc hwitz. Every other  c am p had different form s  of identific ation, 

us ually J ewis h s tars  s ewn on. And the other thing is  that c hildr en m y age were never  in c amps.We 

were us eles s . So we wer e us ed for target prac tic e or other  ways  of killing.
 
 
Any way, Mr .
 
Berec zki s aw
 
--
 
m y grandfather
 
s aid: You know I'm a J ew. He s aid
: Y
es, of 
c our se I k now you're a Jew. And he s aid c om e ins ide. He was hed him up. He put 
mercurochrome
 
on 
his  hand, gave him war m c lothing, bandaged his feet with r ags, and gave him  a war m c oat and told him  

to s leep in the s table. And my grandfather s aid
: Yo
u know I c an't do that. Bec aus e in Poland, if 
a 
non
-
J ew helped a J ew, the whole fam ily of the non
-J
ew was  hung on lamp pos ts. And t
hen the J ew 

5 
 
was  killed and the pers on helping the J ew was  killed. So it's  amazing that any J ews  took  that 
r is k
 
--
 
non
-
J ews  took  the r isk of helping J ews  bec aus e it was  s o hideous ly dangerous .
 
But Mr.
 
Berec zki 
did. And then he gave my grandfath
er
 
--
 
he s aid to m y gr andfather: Look , I'll leave the bar n door open 
and if the Nazis  c ome, I'll just s ay I don't know who s leeps  in my barn. Ok? 
 
 
So the next day he took m y grandfather to a nearby woods, the Borszc zowic e For es t, and 
that's  when my grandfather
 
--
 
he gave him three br eads  and a shovel. And m y gr andfather started 
digging a ditc h to pr otec t him  fr om the weather and als o fr om  the Nazis .
 
 
As  tim e went on, more and mor e J ews  c ame fr om  various  sm all towns  around to avoid s om e 
of the ak tions . Aktion is  when the Nazis  would bring J ews  and bring them  together and have them  
taken by train to Belzec  or  whatever .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So your  grandfather, as time gr ows , eventually he would have more than 30
 
people in 
his  group. You des c ribe he was  tr ying to dig a ditc h to protect hims elf. With that m any people, they 
ac tually built a bunker in the woods .
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Huge, huge, ton of them.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  30 of them. And eventually, of cour s e, his  family would join them ther e. And not only 
were they using the bunk er  as a plac e for  protection, they als o began doing ac ts of res is tanc e agains t 
the Nazis . Tell us  about that time in the bunker.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  My gr andfather  had been a trained offic er in the Fir stWorld War. He had a lot of 
experienc e. So he was  m ade the leader. One of the men who had c ome in to join them  had a gun. And 
ther e wer e women. There wer e well over 30 at one point. But the m en would go out at night and they 
would s hoot the tir es 
of Nazi munitions  tr ucks . And if the driver s  didn't r un away, they would kill them. 
And they would take grenades , guns, r ifles, am mo, whatever. They would als o go at night to the 

Ukrainian polic e depots and get any kind of s upplies  they needed and br ing it
 
back  to the bunk er in the 
woods.
 
 
Now, the bunker in the woods
 
--
 
it was  c old. It was dam p. And the funny thing is, m y very firs t 
m em or y is  actually of that bunker  in the woods .
 
Would you like to hear  about it? 
 
>> Yes.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Ok. What I rem em b
er
 
--
 
and remem ber, I'm c los e to 3 at this  point. I r emember  a huge 
ladder, pr obably s ix feet, no more. You went down on the ladder and there were wet mud walls . And 
one r oom , the largest r oom , was  pr obably about 12
 
feet long, m aybe s ix feet wide. At the e
nd of t
his  
one r oom  was a huge, splinter y, r oundtable. I was feeling my way and it did feel splintery. And on it sat 

a fat c andle, whic h was  the only s our c e of light any wher e. You c ould sm ell that s mell of wax and that 
s m ell of mud. And there was  a s m ell that's har d to describe but it's a c ombination of metallic  and sweat. 

And I c all it the smell of fear. That I remember.
 
 
Now, near  this, there was  like an arc hway. And there was  another  sm aller  r oom. And why I 
r em em ber that was  that I r em em ber ed being fas c inated by thes e big metal things . And I was  about to 
s tart touc hing them. And my grandfather yelled. And he never  r ais ed his voic e at me, never. Muc h les s  
his  hand. He r ais ed his  hand, 
ﬁ
J ula, don't touc h!
ﬂ
  
And I was  s hock ed. And later  I found out I was  abo
ut 
to touc h the r ifles  and grenades , and he was  afraid that I would s hoot mys elf and other s.

I think by that time 
your  mother  had your little s is ter, Tola

took  you out of your hiding plac e in the ghetto, into the woods  
in the bunker wher e he was  hidden with the other m ember s  of the group.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  This  was  s om etim e in 1943. The Nazis  were going to burn the ghetto. Of c our s e, 
that's  wher e my m other,
 
m y father, now my baby s is ter who was  born while hiding in this  hideous hole 
in the ghetto, wer e hiding. So we would all be burned up. So he had gotten s ome Nazi unifor ms , got a 
Nazi tr uc k

well, command c ar. And he and s ome fr iends drove to a nearby wo
ods . He dec ided to get 
us  out. So he went into the ghetto hims elf. And he got m y mother , my father , my baby s is ter  and me 

out.
 
 
What I do remember

I don't r em em ber  any par t of that, but what I r emember is  I rem em ber  
r unning to him and gr abbing his legs 
and s aying, 
ﬁ
Grampy.
ﬂ 
I was  ver y c lose to him. Even his  daughter 

6 
 
didn't r ec ognize him. His  br own hair tur ned white. He had los t a great deal of weight. But I knew who he 
was . And I was  s o happy to s ee him .
 
 
So I gues s  he c arr ied m e bec aus e I r emember c linging to him  like a m onk ey. My father m ust 
have c ar ried m y baby s is ter. The plan was  that we were s uppos e
d  
to be hidden but my mother r efus ed 
to be parted fr om  her  hus band or her father bec aus e s he had already los t her mother . So we all went to 

the tunnel.

take you and your  s is ter fr om the bunker in the for est and to go into hiding with Mr s .
 
Luc ia Nowic ka.
 
Tell us what you c an about why he took you out of the bunker and about taking you Luc ia's  hom e.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  It was  c old and dam p. Of c ours e we c ouldn't bathe in hot water bec aus e you c ouldn't 
m ake fires; the Nazis  would find
 
us. E
veryone got lic e and s cr atc hed, inc luding my baby s is ter and m e. 
And m y baby s is ter would c ry, a lot. And m y m other put her hand over her m outh to stop her  fr om 

c r ying. And I remem ber
 
--
 
well, I was  told that m y grandfather
 
--
 
by the way , the word for gr andfather  in 
Polis h is  Dziadzia. So Dz iadz ia s aid, "Sala, you'll s mother  the baby." But my m other was  frantic  
bec aus e we were making nois e and ever ybody was  alr eady jum py bec ause the Nazis  would c ome and 
kill us  all.
 
 
So my gr andfather , who was  the leader , c laim ed that everyone has  a right to live and he c an't 
allow his  family to endanger  everyone. So he borrowed s om e peas ant c lothing fr om  Mr .
 
Berec zki and a 
c ar t and went to the c entr al market in Lwow. And there he was  looking for  a doc tor who ran a c hildren's  
hom e but he couldn't find him . And he s ays  in his  diar y that he was  s o desperate that he was  just going 
to leave us  ther e in the m arket, thinking, well, we wer e little and we wer e c ute and s omebody would 
take us and he would c ome, if he wer e alive after the war , he would c om e and get us . 
 
 
Well, jus t at that point he m et a woman who had been his  neighbor. My grandfather  had 
helped her  and her hus band out a gr eat deal. He had lent them m oney for the cab bus ines s. He hired 

people for them. So Luc ia was  ver y, very beholden to him. Plus  s he was a neighbor. She was  Catholic  
and Polis h.
 
And as  I mentioned befor e, her hus band had been taken by the Nazis  for whatever r eas on. 
When s he tried to look for him, finally the Nazis  s aid lady, jus t stop or you'll r egret it.
 
 
So s he was at the market. He s ays : Luc ia
 
--
 
s he was  s o sur prised to see that he was  alive. He 
s aid, "Luc ia, c an you tak e my two granddaughters  to s ave their lives ?"  And s he s aid [Speaking

--
 
I'm no longer owning my own hous e
. I live as  a live
-
in hous ekeeper , s o I 
would have to ask  if I c an bring the c hildr
en.
 
 
So they m ade up a stor y, m y grandfather and Luc ia. And the s tory was  that my gr andfather  
was  Luc ia's  husband and he had the photo ID of her  hus band. They were both 6'2", both about 

200
-
s om e pounds. They
 
had s uppos edly brown hair and hazel eyes . So my gr andfather  had his  ID 
papers , and so Aizik Eisen bec am e Stanis laus Nowic ka. So Tola was  almos t 6 m onths now and I was  
alm os t 3. The deal was  that we wer e her dead s ister's  c hildr en. Ther e was  a lot of fighting between 
Pols  and Ukr ainians  at that tim e. And
 
s uppos edly her sister was  killed by some Uk r ainians  but we 
never knew
 
--
 
this  was  a m ade up s tor y. Had the Nazis c hec ked, they would have found out s he was  
very muc h alive. So we were her niec es .
 
> > Bill Bens on: Wer e you given different names as  well?

J ulie Keefer:  I was  s till c alled J ula. My s is ter 's nam e was  changed. But s he bec ame
 
--
 
fr om  Tola 
Weinstock , s he bec am e Antonina Novic ka. And when Luc ia was  taken prisoner, s he was  tak en to a 
Catholic  c hildren's  hom e run 
by the doctor. My grandfather p
a
id
 
three months  in advanc e. He thought, 
well, at least one of us  would be alive. 
 

 
So after  he got her s ettled and I was  s ettled, he went back  into the woods  to c heck  to s ee how 
ever ybody in the woods  was . He found 32 or s o bodies , all over. He knew it was n't their grenades  or 
guns that had blown up bec aus e ever ybody had a bullet hole. And two of the people who wer e s hot 

7 
 
were my mother , his  daughter, and m y father . And he s aid Kaddish, the Jewis h pr ayer  for  the dead. 
And he and one other man who had s er ved in
 
the r es istance bur ied everyone in that huge tunnel in the 
woods . 
 
> > Bill Bens on: What did your grandfather do then?

to br ing in s ome food or whatever .
 
And everyone was  s hot
 
--
 
that was  Apr il
 
1944. I us ed to wonder  
when I was a c hild why m y grandfather looked like he had tears in his  eyes  ever y time m y birthday 
c am e ar ound. And that's when they were all killed.
 
 
And in J une of 1944
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Befor e we c om e to J une, tell us  what you c an about your tim e with Luc ia. At one point 
s he was  ac tually arr ested by the Gestapo and there she is  living in the hom e of another woman, 

Swierc z yns kis . Did they know who you wer e in truth?  Tell us  about that.
 
>> J
ulie Keefer:  I'm  not s ure. I don't think s o becaus e they were mem bers  of a Polis h politic al party 
that was  very anti

Semitis m . So, no. I don't think they knew that we were J ewis h.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And they bought the stor y that you were her niec es?
 
>> Jul

Dziadz ia, he went to Mr s .
 
Swier c z yns ki and s aid
: Can't you help?
 
Bec aus e the inter esting thing about 
the hous e of the Swier c z yns kis  was  that it was  right next to 
the 
hom e of the Nazi gover nor  of 
Lwow
. So 
when you talk about hiding in plain s ight, ther e I was  in very plain s ight. By all of thos e Nazi s oldiers  
and everybody.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And when Luc ia was  taken by the Gestapo, Mr s .
 
Swier c z yns ki was  then c aring for you. 
Right?
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Yes. She was  c aring for me and s he was  trying to c are for my baby s is ter. And s he 
c ouldn't do it bec aus e there were two skinny animals  to c ar e for, a big hous e, all the c ooking, 
ever ything, and s he was  old and s he couldn't do it. That's why m y baby s is ter  was  taken to the Catholic  
or phanage. Everything was c hanged.
 
But, no, I r emained J ula. And actually, pic ture you s aw of me at 
age 3 was  taken by a Nazi s oldier. And this part I don't rem em ber but I was  told. The s tor y

ma

> > Bill Bens on:  Pleas e. By all means .
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  I was  going with Luc ia, my

ﬂ 
and we were walking in one of the parks that was  
s ur r ounding
 
St.
 
Sophia Str eet, where the hous e was. At firs t she was  teac hing me to pick  dande
lions
 
by 
long stems  s o s he c ould m ake m e a wr eath. And s o that funny

looking thing that looks like c urly hair  
is n't. It's  m y beautiful wr eath that I'm wearing on m y head.
 
 
Pr etty s oon s he kept going and I fell as leep. I was  tired. Suddenly
 
--
 
well, s he as s umed that I 
had 
gone to the Swierc z yns ki's  home and that I was  waiting there for her. So s he finis hed what s he 
was  doing and went back  to the Swier c z yns ki
™
s . Then at that point I was  s leeping and a Nazi s oldier  
c am e in full unifor m, and picked m e up and c arried m e to what
 
was  the c los es t hous e, the hous e of the 
Swierc z yns kis . And Luc ia was  looking. She s ees this  s oldier  c arr ying what s he was  s ur e was  a body, 

m y dead body, yes . So she was  about to sc ream. And Mr s .
 
Swier c zyns ki put her  hand over  her mouth. 
Mr s .
 
Swier czyns ki 
s poke Ger man and Luc ia didn't. So s he s pok e to the s oldier . And as  s he was  
s peaking, I woke up. So ther e I was . And the s oldier  s aid
, ﬁ
I found her s leeping and s he reminded m e 
s o m uc h of m y c hild back  hom e and I'm lonely for m y c hild, do you m ind if I take
 
her  pictur e?
ﬂ
  
And 
Luc ia was , 
umm, 
go ahead.
 
So he took m y pic ture and he s ent her a c opy. And s he hid it until the end 
of the war. And that's  the only pic tur e I have of me. And she kept it.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When Lucia was  ar rested by the Ges tapo and leaving you and Tola at that time with 

Mr s .
 
Swier czyns ki, how did s he end up getting r eleas ed?
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Getting r eleas ed? When my Dziadzia went to Mr s .
 
Swierc z yns ki and asked her could 
s he help and Mr s .
 
Swier c z yns ki was  a friend of the governor 's
 
wife. So she went to the gover nor 's  wife 
and s aid
: L
ook, I'm r eally helples s  without m y hous ekeeper  and I don't know why they took her  but I 
c an't c ope. This  is a big hous e. And the governor 's  wife actually knew Luc ia bec aus e Luc ia would do 

s om e c ooking and pas s  her goody and s o forth.

So Mr s .
 
Swier c z yns ki went to her  hus band and s aid: You know, I don't know what the 
Ges tapo is  thinking of; they took  Luc ia, of all things . Of c our s e, they took her  bec aus e s om eone on the 
s tr eet had s aid Luc ia Nowic ka, hous ekeeper for the Swierc z yns kis , was  hiding J ewis h c hildr en. So the 
Ges tapo took her  for ques tioning.Whic h, of c ourse, meant tortur e.
 
 
Well, the gover nor got in his  c ar, went imm ediately to the Ges tapo headquar ters  and s aid, "I 
want Luc ia now." Ok . So the Ges tapo had her c leaned up and s wore her to sec r ec y about what 

happened to her.
 
 
By the way, s he was  tor tured but s he never  broke. She never s aid that we were J ewis h or that 
ther e wer e m ore J ews  hiding in the woods  or anything like that. She was  br ought back
 
as  a

1944? 
 
> > Bill Bens on: What I rem em ber

I just remember some

I r emem ber our firs t apartm ent in L
wow
. 
We got an apartm ent becaus e to the Rus s ians, people who wer e s urvivor s  of c onc entr ation c am ps got 

pr efer ential treatment. So his  preferential tr eatm ent was  that we got this apartment in a mainly burned 

out building, bom bed
 
--
 
ther e wer e big r ocks all over  the plac e. And m y grandfather went all over  L
wow 
looking for J ewis h s urviv or s
 a
nd found one little boy who was  about 10. He was  living with a woman 
who took  c are of him. And my
 
gr andfather s aid: W

didn't want to leave her. And the wom an s aid: I am not going to forc e that c hild to leave. If he wants  to 

s tay, he s tays . Well, that was  the only J ew m y father found.
 
 
Then we left and we went from one DP
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you go there, J ulie, tell us what you c an about Tola.
 

> > J ulie Keefer:  Well, what I c an tell you about Tola was  that she was  m y baby. She had big blue eyes  
like our father , and blond hair . And s he was  my baby. And I kept asking for  "
m
y baby." And I was  told 
that Tola was  s ic k  and she went to the doc tor
 a
nd t
he doc tor  had to take her to a hos pital to m ake her 
all well. And when s he was  all well, s he would c ome back  and join us . Well, I k ept asking and that's  

what I was  told. And I gues s  s he never was  quite well enough.
 
 
But that first home that she was  in, a p
art of the roof
 
--
 
well, the only home. A part of the r oof 
was  bombed. So the 80 c hildr en and nuns were m oved to another  plac e. And
 
--
 
this is  all after the war. 
When m y grandfather went there, s ix months befor e he had found out that the childr en were divided in 
half, 40 c hildr en and 40 c hildr en. 40 were taken to Hungar y. And at that time Hungary was  an 
impas s able wall. You c ould not go in. Bec aus e the Soviets  were very, ver y gr abby of it.
 
And then the 
other part, he went to Ger many. He went to Fr ance. He went to England. He went ever y where tr ying to 

find her. But how do you find a 6

old baby whos e religion was  c hanged, whos e name was

> > J ulie Keefer:  He had s uffer ed a gr eat deal. He began drinking. That was  in s ome ways  his  way of 

c oping at that point.When we were in DP c am p, the las t one, there were many fights and argum ents . 
He went to a hos pital whic h he wr ote in his  diary was  for  his  heart, a hos pital in the alps . But how m any 
hos pitals  for hear t have s hock tr eatm ent?  And he had r ec eived s hock tr eatm ent. So I think that was  for 
any m ental stuff. And he did get better  and was  fine. He was  an am azing, am azing man.

J ulie Keefer:  I r emem ber onc e in DP c amp walking with my grandfather . Rem ember, he was  very, 
very big. And I was  little. He had huge hands . And I was  taking his  hand. And I r emember  looking at 
him  and s aying,

Dziadz ia, when ar e my m ommy and daddy c oming

And he s aid, "T

then that they 
were not coming back.

There was  a pot

bellied s tove for c ooking or heating if you c ould find c oal or  wood, whic h was  ve

very hard to do. And that's  how we wer e liv ing. Food was  unbelievably s c ar c e. Ever ything was  s c arc e. 

Bathr oom s  wer e like thos e outdoor pr ivies  but all in a row, on one s ide of the c amp. No one hear d of 
toilet paper. Everybody us ed news papers . Life was  ver y diffic ult.
 
 
Vis as  to the United States  wer e ver y hard to get. By luc k one day, m y grandfather s aw 
s om ething, a s ign, that said if you were a c hild and an orphan you c ould come to the United States. So 

he had tried to get us  all into Pales tine but var i

 w

So we c ouldn't go to Pales tine

whic h then bec am e Israel later . And then, of c our se, we c ouldn't all go to the United States but I c ould

ﬁN

So they 
tried this exper im ent. They m

of Univers ity Hos pital. I would be taken to s ee Ms .
 
Bar nes , a c hild analys t. I'd play. We would talk. And 
we would talk. And s he was  kind of the one of the m ain s tays of my
 
life for  m any, m any year s .When I 
was  in a talent s how, you have two c ottage parents  and 12 girls, they c an't go to watc h you in a talent 
s how. So ther e was  Ms .
 
Barnes  s itting in the front row as  I s ang "Fr ankie and J ohnny" looking straight

well, m y fir s t bic yc le fr om Ms .
 
Bar nes . She was  just always  m y

And then, of c our s e, I was  s o fortunate. The people who adopted me were s o fabulous. So to

they able to find you?  What was
 
your  firs t m eeting with them ?

B ellefaire
. 
Now, I was  a ward of J ewis h s oc ial s ervic es  at this  point. I was  10 when they c am e to vis it m e at 
B ellefaire
, my J ewis h c hildr en's  hom e. And, of c ours e, they wanted m e, my grandfather des perately, to 
live with them  but they liv ed on the fifth floor  of a walkup with whis key bottles  and needles  all over the 
plac e on the gr ound and a bathr oom in the middle of the hall. And J ewis h s oc ial s ervic es  thought, no. 
Bec aus e they wer e, at that tim e, in a terr ible s lum and that would not be a plac e for me to be.

But when I fir st

I r emem ber the firs t tim e I s aw my gr andfather. His s hoes  squeaked when 
he walked. And they didn't s peak a word of Englis h yet. And I didn't rem em ber my Polis h, m y Russ ian, 
nothing. Nothing. J us t Englis h. And I remem ber that I was  both very exc ited and very kind of

Bellefaire

grandfather for  the kind of per s on he was . He was  a trem endous ly c our ageous , br ave m an. And my 
grandpar ents  stayed in their  hous e while they vis ited with m e. And then, as  I s ay, every s ummer I

I wanted to say a c ouple of things. It took  me a very, ver y  long time in m y life to be 
able to talk about m y ver y early exper ienc es  bec aus e it was  very painful
, w
hic h is  one of the reas ons  
why I do it bec aus e I hope that no other  child has to go through 
s ome of what I had to go thr ough in my 

ear lies t youth.
 
Thos e who deny the Holoc aust, that's why I'm  her e. Bec aus e it did happen.
 
I als o speak  
bec aus e s ix million of my people were for ever  s ilenc ed. So I have just one little voice to s peak  for

Above all, I look to you bec aus e you ar e our future and we ar e s o lucky. I met m any of you, 
and you ar e dynam ite. I love the fac t that you are inter es ted in jus tic e and fairnes s  for ever yone. I love 

that. And
 
that you ar e willing to stand up against injus tic e and not be a s ilent bys tander. I r eally like the 
fac t that you do
 
do that.

well, fir st of all, if you s

Violence jus t begets  m ore and m or e violenc e. Go to the polic e, anybody y ou trus t, and tell them what's 

going on. Go to that person and tr y to befr iend that per s on s o that that person does n't feel all alone.
 
 
And r emember , never  again to anyone.
 
 
Thank  you.
