A: Œ of th e brother, of the Œ I think younger
 brother, who lived in  wa Œ eastern part 

of 
Poland
 also, and he was deported to Œ not to 
Siberia
, because it was in the last 
deportation in April of Œ no, June of 19
41 Œ no, 1940, 1940, 
the same year. And Œ 
and he ended up in Polish army .

A: No, a Œ uncle died before the war. 

Q: Okay. Did you know y
our father™s parents? 
A: No. 
Q: Okay . 
A: My father didn™t have Œ my father™s fa
ther died before the first World War. And 

then his mother was taken care of by th e 
older Œ oldest brother, so there was no 
good relationship with the 
good brother, because he didn™t, I think, do a good 
dividing of the property . So  Œ so my  Œ my
 father just left to the army, and then 

 
Interv iew with Sta n is

never Œ never went back  to him. Bu t he
 had better relationship with his young Œ 
middle brother Œ no, not middle, youngest

so both brothers ended up in
 the same general part of

Poland
. 
A: Right, right. 

Q: Okay . 

A: But he lived in a city, and he was not
 given such a reward for being in Œ in

my  father could ju Œ could do a lot with 
this. We had Œ we had 
ponds, fish ponds,

 our

Arkhang elsk
, at the 
station that Œ I have it in my  book, but not 
in my  head, finally they  stopped th e train 
and si Œ told us to take our stuff out. 
They had, again, sled s waiting for us. They 
helped my  Œ my  brother, or probably one of
 the people was helping to Œ to  put that 
trunk on. And Œ and us Œ and 
my  sister an d  I a n d  my  mom,
 we were allowed to ride,

A: My 15 years old brother. And 
he walked all way to Œ to 
Shilova
. Every night we 
would stop in a village, Russian village, of
 the people that were also deportees from 
the first Œ from the revolution Œ 
Q: Really? 
A: Œ Ru ssian revolution. And at one house 
a wo man , when  sh e saw my  mo m, s h e st 

Œ with th e baby, she started crying. Appare
ntly she had a baby too, and Œ wh en she 

was deported, and now Œ now Œ 
Q: She sees someone else. 
A: Œ she Œ sh e sees one and she Œ she star
ted t-telling my mother Œ my mother spoke 
Russian, because she was through Œ through 
a couple, in German and Œ and Ru ssian 
occupations. So to Œ to  my  mo ther, the la
nguages were not strange. And Œ and then 
Œ then sh  Œ we Œ I don™t know why she took
 us downstairs, but as we were walking 
downstairs, there was a little curtain, and 
she opened that, and she showed a Blessed 
Moth er picture, and she says, I too believe
 in God. And didn™t Œ didn™t say mu ch, 
because they are afraid, you know, their Œ they were afra
id. So Œ so Œ so we slept 
there on the floor. They  provided just floor b
ecause that™s all they
 had, probably one 
bed fo r themselves, and Œ and nothing else. 
So that was our first night. Then s Œ 
then I think we Œ we had like four
 or five Œ they™re in the book. 
Q: Okay .

Q: How long did it take to get to 
Slishko
(ph)? 
A: To 
Shilova

Q: 
Shilova
, excuse me. 
A: A week. 

Q: Okay . And your brothe
r walked the whole time. 
A: And Œ and ev ery da
y he had to walk.  
Q: And what about yo
ur baby brother, your Œ the other brother? 
A: The Œ the baby brother was okay yet, 
and my  mo m Œ but he had very clean Œ she 
probably  had enough powd er or whatever, y
ou know, to Œ to help
 him to heal and Œ 
but that™s Œ that™s all she ca Œ she could do
. But that woman was very helpful. Well, 
I guess we Œ we met a lot of people on th
e way, good people. I cannot Œ cannot 
comp lain. There were bad people, but thos
e not necessa rily were Russians. They 
could be Polish. Because when they stol
e something, I don™t think the Russian 
would carry , because Œ although, who knows? I don™t know. 

Q: So did th is lady Œ did 
this lady have food to 
give you as well, or Œ 
A: Just 
kipiatok
. 
Q: And what™s 
kipiatok
?

A: Just hot water. And they Œ th ey all had 
ra Œ rationing, so we Œ we Œ we couldn™t 
expect and Œ or if Œ if the government
 gave them somet h ing, you know, but 
otherwise Œ and like they appar Œ apparently  
expected that we did take enough food, 
you know, for that. 
Q: So when you get to 
Shilova
, wh at is Œ what did you find there? 
A: They put us in one r
oom, two families. And the ro
om was maybe a Œ like this 
living room to Œ til Œ to here. From there 
maybe it™s even Œ this
 is ba Œ bigger. And 
Œ and one side was boards, and nothing 
else, no mattresses, no nothing, for one 
family, and the other si-side boards also st
a Œ you know, it™s like 
a table, andŒ and 
Œ 
Q: So was it like a room that would be 10
 by 10? Ten feet by te
n feet, or Œ about 
half the size of this living room? 
A: Yeah, that™s Œ that™s all, only Œ only that mu ch. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And there was one table, small table 
in the middle, by the window. And two Œ 
two chairs, but not real chairs lik
e we have, the one with  the back. 
Q: Right. 

A: So Œ and Œ and th en there was one small 
bed yet, a real Œ real bed. That Œ that 
one was my s Œ my  brothers™. 
So four of us in Œ in on
e, across, because otherw ise 

 
Interv iew with Sta n is

January 28, 2015 
 

 
 
 
85
would be not enough room for 
Œ for Œ for us. So Œ so we
 did across, legs Œ legs 
probably  my  Mo m™s were falling Œ showi
ng. And Œ and th e same, the other family 
was three children and the 
father and mother. So Œ 
Q: So five people on on
e, and five in the other. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Ten people in this small room. 

A: In this small room, and one stove, a
nd one of those, like many, many years ago, 
when there was no electric type stoves, or 
Œ or electric whatever, you know, it™s Œ 
it™s very primitive. So Œ so that™s all. Do
 you Œ then the next day, they came, the 
[indecipherable]
 is the one that™s in charge of 
whole Œ whole 800 people there that 
they brought. In Œ in that 
they Œ they Œ he comes, and 
he asks who is Œ who is the 
man in the family. And the 
only man was my Œ my  brot
her. One person has to work , 
he said. So you™re going to 
work, at 15, with the men, 
with adults. And whatev er Œ 
whatever he earned during the day Œ if he
 didn™t make his ra-arash Œ a ration? 
Q: Quota? 
A: Quota. 

Q: Quota, mm-hm. 
A: If he didn™t make his quota, he woul
d get less Œ less bread. There was soup and 
bread that they could Œ could get when  th
ey  were work ing, onc
e a day. And Œ an-

86
and bread, they could divide for mo rning 
and Œ and on lunch. And if Œ if they 
didn™t, you know, then 
they didn™t have it. 
Q: So what did they  do in 
Shilova
, what was ki Œ what was the work that your 
brother had to do? 
A: Cutting. Cutting tr-trees
, trimming branches on them
, and Œ a-and putting them 
in a Œ a mound that they were told that th at™s how it sh Œ the m
easurements have to 
be, the Œ the length of it, a
nd Œ and Œ and so mu ch high Œ 
height, and Œ and so Œ so 
that™s what my brother was supposed to 
Œ and I Œ I didn™t know until I read my 
brother™s report wh en  he Œ wh en  he was getting into  the army , Polish army . So Œ so 

at that time, he wrote that he was not 
getting enough fo od, and they were cutting, 
and that™s why he was ge
tting sick being there. 
Q: So th at meant your Œ your older brother 
was work ing as an adu
lt, even though he 
was 15 years old. 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And was his ration, his 
food, for the whole family? 
A: No, that was for him.

A: Œ as each person should get it. 
Q: And so th ey said he didn™t
 me Œ ma Œ meet his quota Œ 
A: So Œ 
Q: Œ and so he would get less food. 
A: Right, right. 

Q: And the Œ I mean, it sounds like the ca
rds were stacked against him, because he 

was a boy to begin with Œ 
A: Right, right. 
Q: Œ to have to do an  adult job. 

A: Mm-hm. So Œ and on the first summer, 
he came home, they brought him home 
sick. 

Q: So he didn™t come home every day? 

A: No, he was in the camp for half a yea
r, for New Year™s Œ New Year™s day they 
would give the day, that wa
s holiday, and fo r first of May. And th ere Œ there was 
holid ay. So Œ so those days they  would co
me home. Otherwise, they were working 
all the time. 

Q: So he was taken away, and you never sa

 holidays, and in 
the summertime, and you, fr Œ if I count,

A: First time was he couldn™t see. He Œ hi 
Œ he lost the vision at night. So, they sent 
him home, and he came with a raw liver. Because on 
Siberia
 we didn™t see them 
eat. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But when  somebody is si

they found it. And Œ and he 
Œ he came with that, and my mother was ch

onion, no Œ no spices. Maybe she had some

showed me how to cut the trees Œ tree down. 
Q: Okay .

A: Œ or mo re things that they gave us 
to take from home, our sled that we were 
playing with. 
Q: So you could bring a sled? 
A: So we could bring th e sled, just was Œ it 
wasn™t big. It was probably that big. It 
was ours to Œ for down Œ downhill. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And that thing came Œ came 
in so handy, because we took
 that sled, and we went 
to Œ to the Œ where the bog is, but in th

. And there are the 
trees that are dead. So we cut those tr
ees, one by one, and were carrying home. So 
my  brother helped me to prep are that foo 
Œ that wood, and Œ a

how to do it. 

Q: Okay . 

A: So th en, next day, my  si

Q: It wa Œ and it™s Œ it™s what one has hear
d before, that very often the trains would 
stop, and one of the family me mb ers would get out to get something, and then  
they™d be left behind.  
A: Yeah. Bu t some of them catch up, and 
some don™t have luck. They couldn™t find 
out Œ see, that was war, you know. They 
probably left when  there was something Œ 
they got probably clear from Œ from somebody. So  Œ so th at was not a pr Œ on 
purpose for leave those, or leave that, 
you know, it was just happened. And Œ wait, 
what else? Oh, and we were Œ when we 
were going down , and probably the first 

longer stop for us was at the place that wa
s Polish Œ Po lish Œ oh my  gosh, I knew all 
those names and ev Œ whatever. Where Œ Po
lish government small office was there. 
And so I went to report that we lost
 our mother, that Mother stayed in 
Vo log da
, and 
gave thenames, mine Œ 
Irka™s
(ph) and mine, and we neve
r heard of that, you know, 
that anybody report
ed anything, you know. So  she didn™t get that far.  
Q: Did she have the money, 
or did you have any money? 
A: She had the money. She ha
d nice fur lined coat that
 was very warm. And Œ and 
she had our 
I
.
D
., because without 
I
.
D
. you couldn™t get Œ buy the bread. So Œ so my  
Œ my  suspicion is that Œ oh, and another 
thing I have to  tell you. Years later, when 
we arrived in 
Mexico
, in our or-orphanage were two 
little sisters of the boy that in 
Volo gda
 jumped out of that train, and to brin

group back to the Œ he Œ he 
thought that he will make it, 
and they will be able to get 
on th e train. But it didn™t happen . He stayed  with the father, father died. And Œ and 
our mo th er was on a Œ he said on a 
breck
(ph). What is 
breck
(ph)? I tried 
Russia 
Œ 
Russian people, I tried Jewish people, I tr
ied anybody I could imagine, if any knows 

what is 
breck
(ph)? 
Q: Yeah, what is a 
breck
(ph)? 
A: The only thing I can imag
ine, it was a platform, may b e with some si-sides, or 
maybe nothing. And Œ and they  were on that 
breck
(ph) with wh atever they had on, 
and with the wind, when train was going so
 fast, they would never survive if they 
were standing on. So all people, like flie
s were freezing and 
falling off. And Œ and 
somebody fo und my  mo ther frozen, dead. 
And Œ and she Œ and Œ and she had all 
these clothes on, all her documents. She sa
w, on my mother™s doc
ument there is two 
little girls. She would get thr
ee portions of bread at the 
store, not one, and Œ and she 
was probably only one, and she threw her 
clothes off, or just Œ just Œ no, she 
probably  ki Œ kept a Œ a coat. An
d Œ and Œ and she took my  mo ther™s 
I

D
. 
Q: So Œ so you Œ you Œ you th
ink this is what happened? 

A: Right, because exactly ever
ything the same, except Œ ex

who had the same  documents as your mo th er? 

A: Right. 

Q: Did you know th is person™s real name?

Œ that she Œ she traveled from

Everything was the same except instead of from

A: Yeah. Okay, what Œ what
 was the next question? 
Q: The next question is how did y
ou eat, wh o took care of you? 
A: Oh, a couple Œ couple men that were fl
uent in Russian and whatever, they wrote 
Œ they took piece of paper, they wrote 
similar
 format, our names, and we could Œ 
we could buy Œ or they coul
d buy bread. On the train we
 had Œ my mom left a little 
change purse. And Œ and th at Œ that™s Œ th
at has a long story, too, because all of a 
sudden we are looking for that change pur
se, and there is none. But then, a couple 
days later, apparently parents noticed that
 the little girl too-to
ok the change purse 
from us, and she told them, put
 it back where you find it. 
Which is normally is said 
by p-parents. And she did. A
ll of a sudden I pa Œ I look,
 and at the top of that 
container where it was, it™s Œ it still is. So 
Œ so we had some Œ I-I think I have also 
how mu ch I had, but so we used  up th at. 
And then when we we
nt to that Polish 
consulate, oh, I remembered, th
en they gave us 40 rubles. 
Q: Okay . 

A: So we had 40 rubles plus there was like 
in teens, I think, of
 the change. So Œ so 
that lasted until we got to the 
Jalabad
(ph), to that Œ that place, and Œ and then 
[indecipherable]
 about, after I th ink couple days, 
they  fed us, an-and gave us good 
care. And th en they  send us 
to collective farm. And over th
ere we were supposed to 
wait for somethi
ng to happen.

Q: Okay .
 
A: Orphanag e or Œ or something. So after Œ 
after we got there, they just threw us out 
at the station, at the end Œ end of life Œ li 
Œ at the end of line. 
So Œ so for two days 
we stayed there, and we didn™t know wh
at happen Œ will happen
. Good thing we Œ 
we had a good send out, you know, with a little food, 
but not enough fo r two days. 
So Œ so we Œ we were 
eating, and there was a big mound of Œ it™s from 
maku
(ph), 
whatever the name that mean
s. It™s from the seeds of 
bawelna Œ
 aye-aye-aye,

. That was Œ

A: Y-You use for the Œ feeding the cows.

e something else in

. Corn doesn™t grow there, it™s a 
sandy, sandy place. Well, maybe it™ll Œ it will come back. I™ll Œ I will continue. 

Whatever that Œ that was, we were Œ we 
would Œ i-it wasn™t clean on top, so we 
would clean up and eat that, and it was 
very bitter. But, you know, better than 
nothing in your stomach. So Œ so someho
w we surviv ed that. And then next day 
comes 
Kirghizian

Œ so th ey Œ

another girl that was 14. I didn™t know

now we™re Œ we™re in

 Œ we brought home 
and we Œ we ate half and half of that. 
So Œ so we were there until spring, until 
started getting warmer. Next to that hut, ther

went to go somewhere, and here is one,

Q: Did they bite? 
A: No. But Œ unless you step
 on them. And you know, bu
 Œ jump ing over them was

And Œ and we started going to  wo rk, and

and what Œ th ere were some
 other Œ other things, but 
anyway, whatever I Œ I mentioned, and 
the book I Œ I wanted Œ that was for 
Jereczek
(ph). 
Q: Right. 
A: But I Œ I wanted to  keep
 that. One of the teachers t
ook it, and I Œ I didn™t even 
know which one. Skates, the 
teacher told me no, you can
not. You don™t need  it any 
more. We were going to 
Pahlevi
 and 
Tehera n
, you know, there was no ice. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So Œ so th at Œ that somehow she 
co nv in ced  me. Of co u r se my  mo m™s an d  
father™s, I cried, I want to have that, I 
want, because my mom and dad will not have 
any Œ anything to wear, to ch
ange into better clothes. 
And Œ and what we had on, 
maybe we had one change
 of dresses or something th ere.
 But they didn™t allow us to 
take that. But then I asked for book, an
d she allowed me to 
keep the book. She 
allowed me to Œ oh, couple pillowcases that 
we didn™t exchange yet. So Œ so those Œ 
those I Œ I had three of them, because I 
gave one to my  sister, and one to my

brother. So Œ so the pillowcas
es Œ and they were beautiful embroidered, with my 
mom™s initials. 
Q: Oh. 
A: So Œ so I still have th
at. And Œ and there was something else, whatever Œ but Œ 
but anyway, I cried and cried, and she wo
uldn™t let me. And Œ 
but who Œ who had Œ 
and you know th at now in 
church Œ I Œ I belong to  a choir, church choir, and we 
have one song th at we sing, I never can fi
nish. Always end up crying, because it Œ it 
is, when I came to 
the seashore, about 
Jesus
. And ha Œ I shouldn™t talk about it, I 
always cry. Never can finish the song. Ri
ght away I see that in front of me, you 
know. 
Q: The trunk. 
A: The trunk. The trunk is Œ was so important to me at th at time. But Œ 

Q: It was the last piece fro
m your life of your family. 
A: Right. I have those little things yet,
 you know, but Œ but those are not that 
important, apparently . In my book I Œ I dr

important as Œ as that was. That was my
 Œ my  mo m™s Œ how do you call, thing fo r 
the wedding Œ 
Q: Trousseau? 
A: Œ from her grandmother. Trousseau. 

Q: Her di Œ her trousseau. 

A: Trousseau, filled up, you know, from Œ from her 
babcia
. So Œ so  it was 
important. And I don™t know if I ever Œ I ev
er change, as far as 
that, you know, for Œ 
my  mo m was Œ was Œ I cannot forg et her, and Œ and that™s the reason why I wrote 

book. That was because I wanted to Œ 
somebody to find. I thought that some 
miracle will be, and Œ and somebody to 
find. Well, I found a little girl. I found Œ she 
came here to visit her son, from 
Poland

she wanted to Œ to co me to see us. And 
I thought maybe we™ll develop a friendship, 
but Œ but she says she 
has to go back to

Q: Now, you found a little gi

A: Well, she™s Œ she™s no

something wakes me up. And one time the 
whole ceiling, I don™t see the ceiling, I 
don™t see the pictures. Like I am in some 
kind of thing, and Œ
