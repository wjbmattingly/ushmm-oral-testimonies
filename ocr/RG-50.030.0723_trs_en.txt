happened to get on the tr

Hanover
, and we went to Camp

, and I went up Œ I slept in the barracks that night. The next 
mo rning I walked down th e stairs, and 
here is my  ba Œ my  brother-in-law 
[indecipherable]

that™s all. A nd I ended up in a Œ an aircra
ft, nine millimeter aircraft outfit. I send Œ 
we were in the country for 
about a year, I guess, and then we were shipped over to 
Euro pe
. 
Q: And so you stayed at Camp  
Edwards
 the whole time? 
A: Pardon me? 
Q: You stayed at Camp 
Edwa rds

any more, but anyway, it wa Œ it was 
Georgia
, and we moved Œ 
Q: And what kind of Œ yeah, and what
 kind of training were you getting? 
A: Only  with Œ I was Œ I Œ I was a meteorolog
ist. So there was four of us, as a meter 
Œ wh at we do is make gas, and we blew 
up large balloons to send up so that the 
radar could track the Œ the balloon, and we
 put an aluminum kite on the bottom of 
the balloon, and that would rise up, and then
 the Œ the radar could track that, so that 
the guns would track wherever th e radar would take them. Then the Œ the radar 

would pick up th e Œ an airplane
 and then th at would Œ the 
guns could shoot at it, so 
Œ 
Q: Oh, I see, so this was what your job was, 
is to be able to Œ be able to read radar Œ 
A: Oh yeah, right, yeah. 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

16
Q: Œ in order for the radar to be able to
 locate where of Œ an 
enemy airplane could 
be. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 the Œ the Œ the balloons would rise, and then  the radar would 
pick that up, and the radar would tell the 
guns where to Œ where to move. They  were 
very large guns, they were 
je Œ 90 millimeter guns, which were a very big sh ell. 
And there wa Œ wa Œ that™s wh
at Œ we used that for Œ so 
we went overseas as Œ as a 
Œ an anti-aircraft 
Q: Anti-aircraft, okay. 
A: Yeah. So we trained in
 Eng land
 and Œ and fo r a few months. And there I met a 
number of architects who were there design
ing build ings already,
 and highways for 
after the war, and I met people there from 
the Œ the British architects™ board, and we 

became very good friends. So a Œ I got Œ 

Q: Where di Œ where in 
England
 were you stationed?

already. We were there only a couple of 
months, and then, of 
course, we went to 
Euro pe
, and I got seasick. 
Q: Were you part of 
D-Day
? 
A: No. No, we landed at 
Cherbourg
, and went from there to about seven different 
countries, I guess. We were Œ we were
 hunting th e Germans down, but we had 
something to shoot at for a while, but there™s a 
[indecipherable]
 we didn™t have any 
more airplanes, German ai
rplanes to shoot at, so Œ 
Q: Tell me, when  you landed in

safe door, blew the safe all apart, and we 
got a lot of money, but it wa Œ it wasn™t Œ

A: All I saw was a lot of dead people. At 
Dachau
, anyway. I-I was told
 to go to this 
office building, wh ich was really one of th
e ca Œ the gates where the architectural 
engineering office was. That was for do
ing my job, and that™s where I met 
Alfons 
Kamyczek
(ph), who was a Œ who wo rked  in
 the office for the German 
SS
 shir Œ the 
SS
 troopers, and Œ 
Q: Who was this 
Alfred Kamyczek
(ph) Œ 
Alfons Kamyczek
(ph), who was he? 
A: He was Œ he was a prisoner of Œ from 
Poland
, he was a prisoner for four years, 
he Œ he had picked th em up wh en he was 
18 years old, and he Œ th ey took him to 
Dach au
, why I don™t know, and wh ile he was 
there, he learned to speak German 
and English. And he was in the architectural
 office, or the engineering office, where 
all the records were. 
Q: And what was your job supposed to
 be? You know, wh en they  asked fo r 
someone with architectural backgro und, what do they want him for? 

A: Well, the funny Œ funny part about it was, 
that nobody ever told
 me what to do. I 
Œ 

Q: Really? 

A: Really, yeah. Well, things were movi
ng so fast, you know. People were being 
shot, and it was Œ all kinds of things were
 going on, and Œ and at the time I was just 
happy to be in this office, and I would ge
t things to eat that people Œ Americans

were Œ half the Americans were already ther
e, so their rations 
and so on were re Œ 
being brought in by the American army . An
d we were trying to get rid of all the 
SS
 
people over there, and the war 
was still moving on. Th-Th-The Œ 
Q: It was the final days, yeah. 
A: Yeah, it was, yeah, it™s exactly right, yeah. And Œ 

Q: So Œ okay, so I™d like, agai
n, I want to back up a bit. 
A: Okay . 
Q: When we get to 
Dachau
, and th is guy Œ yo-you™re told
 to pack  your bags, you™re 
not told  where to go, wh ere you™re going to  be going Œ 
A: That™s right. 
Q: Œ and you get Œ and yo
u get to this place Œ 
A: Sure, sa Œ 
Q: Œ do you rememb er what it is that you 
saw, right at the gates? Did you rememb er 
any of that? 
A: Oh, well, I Œ I saw the Œ the Œ there wa
s a disarray. Nobody re Œ nobody really 
knew what they were doing, or what they 
were supposed to do, 
other than shoot the 
Germans. 
Q: Okay , but did you Œ did you Œ did you
 understand wh ere you were heading? 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

25
A: Oh yeah, well I didn™t Œ no, I didn™t kno
w. When Œ when I wa
s told Œ I mean, I 
saw the Œ the bul Œ on the 
bulletin board , the notice that somebody was needed, I 
had no id ea where I was going, or anything
 else. I didn™t know who Œ wh ere they 
were. 
Q: Did you know th at there were such 
things as concentration camps before Œ 
A: No, I didn™t know. No, I never Œ I never 
ev en knew that Œ I never even heard of 
Dach au
 before. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Sa Œ so, that™s why I™m say it Œ it was 
kind of crazy, because I Œ I didn™t Œ I 
haven™t Œ I was foolish really for Œ in the service you don™t volunteer. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But I Œ I volunteered to 
do whatever they
 said, because it Œ I thought well, 
somebody needs an architect, or a mar Œ so
mebody with architectural experience. 
So when I get there, I meet this man, 
Alfons Kamyczek
(ph), he™s in the office as Œ 
as Œ he™s just there. In fact, 
he lived there, as well, in th
e Œ in the Œ in the Œ it was in 
the build ing. So  anyway, he told me what ha
ppens there, we ha Œ we were in charge 
of the Œ the water and sewer 
and Œ and then  I ended up be
ing the director to Œ to 
pick up all these bodies. And I said well,
 what are we go Œ what are we going to 

use, and anyway  Œ an d we ended up with an
 old tractor, a Œ and a Œ a trailer to pull

behind th e tractor. So we had to  go over to
 the barracks where these people were di 
Œ if Œ if you Œ 
Q: Were there still prisoners in 
Dachau
? 
A: Oh, my  heaven s, yes, there was 30,000 there yet. 

Q: When you walked in ther
e were still 30,000 people? 
A: Oh su re, yeah. 
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 
Q: Did an ybody come up to  you, of these Œ of the prisoners? 
A: Oh Œ oh, yeah, why, sure, I 
talk ed to a Œ in fact, I have
 pictures of some of them, 
and yeah, I got to know quite
 a few of them, but those Œ there was a lot of people in 
the barracks that were dead, that we didn
™t know. If you didn™t move, you didn™t 
move your anything, you were considered 
dead. We had a Œ a dentist as a Œ as a 
doctor, so what could he do for 
us? And so nobody 
really knew Œ 
Q: Well, did anyone give you an  explan a
tion of wh at you had come across? If you 
didn™t know that there even
 had been such a place as 
Dachau
, who Œ who explained 
to you why they were there, and who th ese people were? 

A: Well, as I say, a pa Œ the Œ th e Œ th
e Œ the American army was coming through, 

they were Œ they were getting all the guards
 together, and they shot them. In fact, I 
have some pictures of them shoo Œ shooting th em. 

Q: Did you see these executions? 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
27
A: No, I took a picture of them, in fact, 
while they were goin
g there. These poor 
guys were standing there with their hand
s up, and the Americans shot them anyway, 
it didn™t make any difference; they were guards. But th-the German 
SS
 guard ed the 
things, but when  these people were Œ were
 dead, and th ey  were either gassed, or 
whatever, into the crematory, they were Œ 
th-the Œ the Germans didn™t Œ they didn™t 
handle these people that were passed away
 or put into  the crematory. They would 
get prisoners of theirs from 
the Œ from the barracks to come
 in and do all this work 
in the crematory. So  they would move th
e bodies around with their bare hands and 
so on, and put them in the furnaces, or
 whatever. And Œ but they  Œ th e Œ the 
SS
 
didn™t do the Œ they didn™t actually do any 
of the wo rk, they just did th e orders, it™s 
Œ in other word s, they directed the people wh at to do. 
Q: By th e time you got to that camp, were there any 
SS 
still there, or they™d all been 
either arrested, or escaped? 

A: Oh, there ba Œ there were a lot of 
SS
 there, there were loads of 
SS 
there. We had 
si Œ 30,000 prisoners in the camp when  I go
t there, from 31 different countries. And 
so, they were Œ they were to ld that they could leave. 
Well, they wanted something 
to eat, so they were eating 
American rations, and so on, 
and Œ but Œ but the th ing is, 
a lot of those people couldn™t even  walk, 
th ey didn™t know wher
e they were from, 
they didn™t know what they
 were gonna see when they 
got home, and the Œ this Œ 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

28
the roads were just fi-fille
d with people all over the place, and the ro  Œ other ca Œ 
other prisoners in other camps, they were 
also let go. And they were all, everybody 
was out in the street, w alking, just walk
ing, they didn™t know where they were 
going. So Œ and there was no 
transportation provided  for them, so Œ so you just Œ 
they Œ I don™t know wh at ever happened to  
these people, I have no idea. I was just 
there in the camp, just happy
 to be Œ be there. And I reme mb er one day some bird 
colonel walked in the office and said, 
Coulson
, it™s good to see you here, he said, 
I™ll see you when  you leave. And that wa
s my  orders. So I Œ I had been da Œ a 
couple of times during the year, I was to 
the commandants ca Œ to his house, which 
was located right in the middle of the camp
, and I was there for couple drinks and 
so on, I guess we had some wine and so  on, but that™s the only Œ that™s the only 
orders I had, and I was there for a year. 
And then eventually 
the Œ the war crimes 
trials came in t-to the camp, 
and they Œ and they tried th
e Œ the people that were still 
living. And the doctor was there that di
d all the experiments on these prisoners, 
poor souls, and they ™re treated like animal
s. A n imals are better treated than these 
people were. And I met a lot of people. I met people from 
Austria
 and so on. I met 
a count there, and I met the other Œ the o
fficers™ mess Œ the American officers™ mess 
had a Œ a German chef, who I had him Œ I 
don™t know, and he and I became friends. 

So Œ so he wanted me to Œ 
to go half on a ski lodge down
 in the mounta
ins. So one 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

day he took me down to see the ski lodge, 
it was a beautiful place. Anyway , he said 
Œ I said, well, what are Œ what do I have to
 put into it to buy this? He said, well, do 
you ha Œ for half of it you
™re going to have to come up with 300 American dollars, 
with real, actual cash. And we said Œ I sa
id, I™m not allowed to have American cash 
here. So he said, well, can y
ou get it? And I se Œ I wrote to my  wife and said, just 
send me 300 American dollars, which she di
d. And anyway, I said to this Œ this 
German chef that Œ but which was going to 
be my partner for the Œ the chateau. And 
Œ and I said, how am I gonna get my  mone
y out of it when I leave here, how can Œ 
how can I get my  money? Cause there was no 
Œ no di Œ no transfer of money funds 
or anything else between the countries at 
that time. And anyway, he said I don™t 
know. So I ended up selling my  money on 
the black market and I did pretty well 
with that. Bu t so Œ my  300 dollar Œ I don™
t know what these poor souls did with the 
American money. Most cases I sold it to th
e Œ the Germans, they bought mo st of the 
money, because Americans we
ren™t allowed to have it. 
Q: Well, tell me, for how mu
 Œ do you remember what the 
black market rate was for 
an American dollar? 

A: Oh, I have no idea, I have no i Œ  
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
30
A: I have no idea. I sold cigarettes, wh
ich we™d get a carton of cigarettes every 
week, and I used to sell them. And I sent
 the money back , and after a while they 
were catching up to us sendi
ng all this money back home,
 so Œ so I Œ anyway, they 
decided th at evwa Œ everybody would have 
to have a Œ the Œ a book that when  you 
got your pay, wh ich I got five
 dollars a month, and then 
they™d write down in that 
book, and Œ that you had Œ that you got five
 dollars in pay, so you couldn™t send any 
more money back any more. We were
n™t allowed to send Œ send it back. 
Q: So, I want to understand a few things ab
out what you just told me, because some 
of it is clear, and some of it is conf
using to  me. You ge
t to Œ you get to 
Da cha u  
Œ 
A: Okay . 
Q: Œ you go into a building Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ and this is, I don™t kn
ow what kind of building. 
Was this an office building 
within the campground? 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yes,
 some of the buildings are very nice, as there Œ some 
buildings were three and four stories, and well-built for the Œ the 
SS
 had used as a 
training camp , and then  they sw itched over to
 just as a Œ as a se Œ a concen tration 
camp, where they brought peop
le in from all the Œ all over 
Europe
.

Q: Yeah, but the building that 
you went into, that you found 
Alfons Kamarek
(ph) 
there Œ 
A: Right, that was a Œ 
Q: Œ wh at was Œ wh at was that building for? 
A: Okay, that Œ oh, that™s a large Œ that wa
s se veral storie s. That was Œ it was re ally 
one of the gates. The gate. In
 fact, there™s a picture in my
 Œ in my book there. And 
we had about, let™s see, one, two, three, 
four d Œ rooms, and I had an apartment on 
the Œ the third floor, where I slept. And Œ we
ll, it wasn™t an apartment, it was just a 
bedroom, really. 

Q: And who Œ would a Œ w
ho would have slept there 
befo re you did? Jur Œ 
A: Oh, I Œ I would th ink it was Œ I think it 
was just empty space, as far as that was 
concerned. 

Q: Okay . 

A: Yeah. The Œ the first floor was all o
ffice area, and Œ and the American sold Œ 
soldier used to Œ was like a big eagle over th
e gate, right next door to us, and I used 
to hear this popping sound, and the Ameri
cans were Œ used to tr
y to shoot the eyes 
out of the big eagle that 
were a-a-above the gate. 
Q: So this was an iron gate, not a real Œ not a real bird. 

A: Oh no Œ oh no, it was a big bird, th
e German eagle, or whatever it was Œ

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ above the gate. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And then  Œ and th e 
gate was down below. 
Q: But it was Œ it was Œ it was a metal eagle. 
A: Oh yeah, right, yeah Œ 

Q: It was a metal eagle. Okay. 
A: Œ oh yes, yeah, sure, yeah. 
Didn™t know abou
t plastic then. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Or not mu ch about them, anyway. So  yeah, was a big Œ 
Q: And so Œ 
A: Œ big metal Œ yes, th-the eagle. 

Q: Œ you Œ you got to know
 this Œ this Polish prisone
r of war, whose name was 
Alfons
. 
A: That™s right. 

Q: And did he tell you anything of wh
at had been going on in the camp ? 
A: Oh yeah, oh sure, he told me quite a 
bit about what was happening th ere, what 
had happened, and how he 
was treated, and so on. 

Q: What did he tell you? 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
33
A: If Œ well, if someone tried to escape 
somewhere Œ I don™t know how they  ever 
get out, I don™t think th e Œ I think there wa
s a big wall around the whole round Œ the 
whole camp, so Œ cause the people in 
Dach au
, which was only ab out a half a mile 
away Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ said that they didn™t know what was 
going on in the camp. They had all these Œ 

the comma ndants and the Œ the Œ th e German
 officials an d so on, lived in nice 
houses just outside the wall. 

Q: I see. 

A: So, I don™t know, I guess the people in 
Dachau
 Œ I mean in Œ in th e Œ yeah, the 
town of 
Dachau
 thought that was just 
a training camp for the 
SS
 there. That™s was 
there from 1933, so up to Œ 
until the 40s, then it became
 a concentration camp, and 
the 
SS
 operated it. So 
Alfons
 told me almost what I ha
d to do, wh at he was doing 
for years, was making drawings, and so on 
for buildings and thi
ngs like this. And Œ 
Q: What kind of Œ ex cuse me, I™
m going to go in to
 some detail. 
A: Okay . 

Q: What kind of buildings 
was he making drawings for?
 Within the camp itself? 
A: Oh yeah, oh, everything was i Œ was in the camp , oh yeah. Yeah, right. 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
34
Q: Okay . And what kind of
 drawings Œ wh at kind of 
buildings was he making the 
drawings for? 
A: Well, there Œ there were Œ well, most
 of them were to house the prisoners. 
Q: I see, barracks and things. 

A: And Œ yeah, right, yeah, the barracks an
d so on, things like that. Or service 
build ings, and so  on, maybe it™s a place of Œ 
to house th-the vicious dogs and so on. 
So it Œ if somebody tried to escape, they™d
 send th e dogs after them, or whatev er, 
and then  wh en they  caught them down  ther
e, they™d sh oot them, 
so Œ so there™s not 
much chance to get away. But 
Alfo ns
 would tell me, many days, if somebody tried 
to escape or work Œ coming b
ack from their work, 
outside the barracks, they all had 
to line up there, and they had to stand th
ere until they caught 
this guy, and then, no 
matter what the weather was, if it was snow
ing or raining, or wh atever it was, or 

heat or whatever, they had to stand out 
there in the street until they found them. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And that was days 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: Here™s another question. 
A: Œ many hours. 
Q: When  you met 
Alfons
, he was a prisoner, or he had been a prisoner. 
A: He had been a prisoner. 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
35
Q: And then you saw people who were in
 the barracks, who were still alive, b u t 
barely. Did 
Alfons
 look any different from them? Did Œ he was Œ was he just as 
skeletal and as mal Œ  
A: No, was Œ the odd thing about it was that 
he Œ h-he was fairly dressed. I mean, he 
had shirt and trousers on. Wh ere he got th
em, I had no idea. I don™t know wh ere he 
got them. But the Œ the prisoners, the-
they Œ they™re Œ 
they™re Œ they™re 
[indecipherable]
 next to rags when th Œ when th
ey came in there,
 and th ey were 
always brought in on trains, closed boxcars
 and so  on. Most Œ some of them were 
open, but most of them are closed, that 
way nobody outside, th
e civilians wouldn™t 
know Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ who was coming in there on the trains
. And so  that™s where the death train was 
parked, somewhere outside ou
r office. Everybody smelled this thing one day, and 
wondered what was going on
. And when  somebody opened 
the doors on, and that™s 
where we saw these two guys that Œ two outof 400 that lived. So  a friend of mine 

went down to Œ into  the Œ in 
Da cha u  
and got the mayor and I 
don™t know who all, 
all Œ some of the officials, and brought th
em out to Œ to Œ to 
take these people off 
the cars that were there, the dead people th
at were there. And they had them Œ th-
there was no gloves or anything else, they had 
to use their bare hands, he insisted on 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

that, that d Œ that day, taking these people 
out. So what they did is they hauled them 
to the crematory and they were di
sposed of there, the bodies Œ 
Q: So the mayor and other officials from 
Dachau 
were told Œ 
A: From 
Da cha u
 th ey br Œ he Œ he Œ he went 
in, collect all th
ese people up an d 
brought them out to the camp. 

Q: Did you see that? 

A: Oh yeah, sure, because 
th-the train was just a short distance from where our 
office was. 

Q: And how did the mayor of 
Da cha u
 behave wh en he was told to do this? 
A: Well, he wasn™t too happy about it, le
t me  tell you, none of them were, cause 
they said they didn™t know 
that this was happening. So  Œ so anyhow, there™s the se 
400 people, they™re almo st all dead, and 
Œ and it was just a horrible mess, and so 
they had to pick these 
people up and take th em to the crematory. 
Q: Was that far from the place where the train was? 
A: Oh, it was maybe a block or two away. 
So th-they had to dispose of them, and 
they Œ they cleaned 
the cars up somewhat, and they ju st
 wipe them out, or whatever. 
They had 
[indecipherable]
 brooms or some thing that th
ey had, and cleaned up the 
Œ the freight cars, but

Q: Yeah. 
A: Okay . 

Q: So when we™re cleaning out the death 
train, you have all these sort of town  
officials fro m 
Dachau 
there Œ 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Œ having to do th is with their hands, sa
ying that they didn

A: That™s right. 
Q: Œ befo re, and not happy that they  have to get themselves in Œ 

A: And th-they had to  clean these cars out there Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ and Œ and dispose of th
ese Œ the deceased people that were on the train. I have 
no idea where they were from. They were 
probably  brought in from other camp s. 
But, as the war was m
oving on real fast, the 
SS
 didn™t want the Am
ericans to talk to 
any of these people, but they were bri
nging people in from other camp s, hundreds 
of people. They  were probably  bringing 
in  from other ca Œ other areas, into

Dach au
, and then, of course, you try to get 
rid of them and you Œ and they were 
trying to  take them to other camps from th
ere. And the the Americans caught them 
because they were movi
ng so fast. The war Œ 
Q: So in other words, 
they Œ they were Œ they
 Œ the Œ the peop Œ th e 
SS
, which was 
in charge of the concen tration camp s Œ 
A: Correct. 

Q: Œ was trying to get Œ to ke
ep them separate from their Œ  
A: From the Americans 
talking to anybody Œ 
Q: Œ from the Americans, yeah. 

A: Œ or seeing Œ seeing what they  were 
really doing there. But these people were 
lying in the Œ in the barrack
s and so on. Most of them 
were dead anyway, so the Œ 
like I say, if you didn™t move, you were c
onsid ered dead . So, we just pile them up 
and put them on the gurney , or wh atever it 
was that we had there, and either took 
them to a Œ a Œ we Œ we got a bulldozer to
 dig a big hole, and 
you just pushed these 
dead people in the Œ 
the Œ you know, just Œ 
Q: And who was Œ who was manning the bulldozer? 

A: Oh, I had one of the Œ 
Q: American? 
A: Œ that was American Œ 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

39
Q: American. 
A: Œ that was American, oh yeah, it was American. 

Q: Okay . 
A: But it was Œ yeah, the Americans brought
 the Œ the engineers 
brought a bulldozer 
from some other camp somewhere, and we 
just dug a big hole and pushed  them in. 
Was a sad day, but nobody 
knew who these people were. No had Œ nobody had any 
idea who they were. 

Q: I can imagine that 
everybody was shocked. 
A: Oh, well, it was just Œ that was the Œ 
the thing that I™d been doing the day, and 
that never happened, nobody 
di Œ they didn™t really 
think anything about it. 
Everybody was upset about it, I™m sure, be
cause I know people tell me that when 
they saw these things that Œ that they c
ouldn™t believe that this was happening to 
anybody, any human being, how
 they were treated. At 
Dachau
 th ey Œ they did 
many tests there. The doctors
 would try different inocul
ations on th e people. They  
put them in Œ they were tes
ting a palette of Œ of uniforms
 there, and they Œ th ey put 
them in cold water, because if the po
wer came down over the Œ the Œ the ocean 
between 
England
 and Œ and 
France
, they would be in co ld
 water. They  wanted to 
know wh at Œ wh at kind of uniforms you sh
ould make for them. 
These tests were all 
done befo re we got there, of course. 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

Q: Did somebody show you the places wher
e these were done? I mean, is this Œ did 
you go to those places where Œ 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, sure we went there, but 
that was all part of the camp, there were 
special rooms, and so forth, these 
tests were done. And Œ and they  Œ 

Q: I™m interested to find ou
t what it is that you saw. In other word s, did Œ did 
someone bring you around from room to 
room to explain, this is what Œ 
A: Oh no, we just walked 
on our own. You ju st went wh erever you wanted to go, 
yeah. 
Q: Was there any place that you went, th
at looked  kind of co
nfusing, you know, 
what was this for, or what was that for? 
A: Oh yeah, sure, yeah. Well 
th Œ one of the experiment
al buildings, you had to Œ 
where Œ where these tests were done, and so  
on, one of the tests 
I know they  Œ they 
put these people in ice Œ in ice water, lik
e in the Œ wh ich would have been the 
ocean, and they pu
t them in Œ they took these guys
 out, and put them in bed with 
two girls. They wanted to
 see if body heat was going to
 revive them. And I don™t 
know why, because th
ey wouldn™t have them out in the airplane, it didn™t make 
sense. But anyway, that™s what they were 
doing. They  were trying all kinds of tests 
there, different kind of Œ of
 diseases and so on. And of
 course you end up hanging 
the Œ the doctor who was in charge of all this.

Q: Did you see him?  
A: Oh yeah, I saw him, yeah, before thei
r Œ I remember they 
took him to the war 
crimes trials, that™s where I saw him, but I never went to the war cri Œ I didn™t really 
care about what was happening at the Œ at 
the war crimes trials. They had all the Œ 
the German 
SS
 people over there. 
Q: Were you Œ when  you™re telling me these 
things, what I™m not sure is, is this Œ 
this something you learned afterwards, wh
en you were out of the camp, or di Œ 
someone told you when  you were in the camp? H-How Œ 

A: Well, I was Œ I was in the office most of the time. W e were Œ 

Q: Mm-hm. And wh at was your Œ wh
at were you doing in  the office? 
A: Well, we were Œ we
 were making drawings 
[indecipherable]
 instructed over 
what to do and so on. You gotta rememb e
r, I was only 23 years old, I didn™t have 
that much experience myself. 

Q: I got that. I understand. 
A: So Œ so Œ 
Q: But I™m trying to  get a sense of what you
r experience Œ not that you had to know 
everything. 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
42
Q: But, for example, when 
you were making drawings in the office, since it was no 
longer a concentration camp , and people 
were being let go, what were you making 
drawings of? 
A: Well, the thing was, what we were doi
ng renovations, because they were Œ th ey 
were getting ready to  have th
e war crimes trials there, 
just for those people that 
were in the camp. And there was a like a c
ouple hundred  people that were there, 
that were prisoners, 
SS
 officers and so  on. And that
™s where they had the war 
crimes trials. And th e docto r was there, and Œ 
Q: Within 
Dach au
? 
A: In 
Da cha u
, yeah, right. 
Q: So they didn™t go to 
Nuremberg
? 
A: Oh no, no, not these pe
ople. These people were cons
idered low class people. 
Q: I see. 

A: And they  have Œ they held th e Œ the Œ 
the Œ the hearings right there, and if the 
guy was guilty, we took him Œ or they took 
him out and hung him, and that was it. It 
didn™t make mu ch difference. So one day Œ 
Q: So you Œ excu  Œ okay, one day, mm -hm?  
A: Some Œ some officer walked in, I don™t 
know what he was a
ny mo re, and he said 
they wanted a new gallows 
because when they hung these people, these newspapers 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

43
were there and so on, and they  would se
e these guys hanging th ere, down below the 
Œ the ba Œ the floorboards, th
ey™d come through,
 and th ey™d take pictures of them. 
And so these peop Œ the American officers 
didn™t want that any more, so they asked 
me to design a new gallows for them, whic
h we did, an d then all we did was put 
some canvas around it, so that the Œ the ne
wspaper people who were there couldn™t 
see or take pictures of these people that were hanging. 
Q: Oh, I see. 
A: So, it was Œ it was pretty crude when yo
u really think about it. There was the Œ 
there was really no order. The object was ju
st to get rid of these people who were 
running the camp, that was it, really. It 
was Œ it didn™t make any difference Œ we had 

Œ some people would Œ would talk about ot
her Œ they™d get info rmation about their 
fellow wo rkers and so on. So  that™s how pe
ople knew wh at their jobs were, because 
the Germans didn™t want Œ and I don™t know 
what I want to say here Œ they didn™t 
want to Œ they didn™t want
 their Œ their buddies to n 
Œ to know what they were Œ 
what they  were doing when  these pe Œ wh en
 the pri Œ the prisoners were there. So 
that™s really wh at the war crimes trials 
were all about, you know, just Œ actually it 
was just a ha Œ it was really a farce when yo
u really think about it, because they just 
wanted to  get rid of these people that were 
guards there, of the 
Œ of the inmates, th-
the pri Œ the prisoners.

Q: Okay, I™m a Œ I™m 
a little confused here. 
A: Okay . 
Q: When  you™re in th e camp,
 you have Œ you come in and 
there™s still lots and lots 
of people.  

A: Okay . 

Q: And some of them are the former gua
rds and Œ and those who were, you know, 

in charge, whether they we
re highest level or not Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah, right. 
Q: Œ but they were in charge
. And now th ey are prisoners. 
A: That™s right, yeah. 
Q: And the Œ and then  you 
have thousands upon th ousand
s of former prisoners, who 
they were Œ 
A: Correct. 

Q: Okay. And during the time 
you were there, did those former prisoners leave, or 
did they  ste Œ 

A: They were told to Œ they
 were told to leave, yeah, 
because we didn™t want them 
there. We had to feed them, we had to take
 care of them and so on. We didn™t Œ we 
didn™t want them there any more becau
se they™d just le
ave, you know Œ 
Q: Well, did they, or did they stay cause they had nowh ere to go? 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
45
A: Well, some of them stayed there becau
se they had nowhere 
to go, and I wo uld Œ 
whe-when I needed
 help in the office, I would get 
drafts-people Œ I Œ in fact, I had 
two people, I have pictures of
 them, two drafts-people from 
Berlin
, and they  didn™t 
want to go back to 
Berlin
 because the Russians were th
ere, and the russ Œ and the 
Russians and th e Germans hated each other. 
So these people stayed on there, I Œ I 
told the guys the fact that 
there was a front door right in our office that walked  out 
on th e street, that Œ which bypassed the gate
. And I told them to go ahead and leave, 
and they said they didn™t
 want to leave. So I Œ 
Q: These were former prisoners? 
A: No, these were Œ yeah, these 
were German prisoner of ours.  
Q: Okay , no, they we
ren™t former prisoners of the Germans? 
A: No, no, they were Œ th
ey were wi Œ I would get 
[indecipherable]
 we brought Œ 
we brought 4,000 German prisoners in to 
live in the camp after all the other people 
left. 

Q: Got it. 
A: They were prisoners of ours.  

Q: Okay .  
A: So an yway, I got two drafts-people 
out Œ out of the cage. If we wanted a 
plumber, or somebody to fix the plumbing, 
we got somebody out of the cage that 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

was a prisoner of ours then, because we 
had prisoners br-brou
ght in. And we had 
nowhere to take them, so we 
had to put them in there, some of them were a big Œ 
some people lived at the Œ the Œ oh, the race
track, and they lived in the barns there, 
they had prisoners there. We didn™t
 know what to do with them, so Œ 
Q: So these prisoners, th
e German prisoners now Œ 
A: That™s right, all ours. 

Q: Œ were coming in  Œ of 
yours Œ of the American Œ 
A: A-After these Œ after we got Œ we go
t some of the people out from other 
countries Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ that were prisoner of th Œ of the Germans. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Yeah, so Œ 

Q: Okay , did they live in 
the same  barracks that the other prisoners have lived in? 
A: No, th ey had Œ they had some Œ they ha
d nicer buildings to 
live in, they didn™t Œ 
they didn™t stay in these Œ in th
ese shacks that they were there. 
Q: Okay . 
A: No, th ey had better build ings. 
Q: So the Americans Œ Americans ho
used them in better facilities. 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
47
A: That™s right, yeah, that™s
 what they had to  do. We 
had about 4,000 there. They 
were from 
Hungary
 and 
Italy
 and from all counties. They 
Œ they were Œ they were 
fighting against us. In other words, they were our prisoners Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ and we took over them, and Œ and then
 Œ then we let them go, after a while, 
you know, if they weren™t too important. 
They were from all countries, as well. 
Q: So Œ so, were you designing
 anything else, besides gallows? 
A: Oh yeah, well other buildings for rem
odeling mostly, it was Œ was. Course a lot 
of the buildings were already there, they
 were good buildings, some of them were 
three and four stories of brick constructi
on, in fact. There were some very good 
build ings there. 

Q: Did 
Alfons
 
Ka na rek
(ph) stay with you the whole time, or did he leave? 
A: Oh yeah, he was Œ no, he was there th
e whole time. Fact, he was there when I 
left, and I don™t know why 
he didn™t go back to 
Poland
, but he said he didn™t have 
any way to get there, so he
 wasn ™t going to  walk. So Œ and there was no trains, there 
were trains, but Œ but they di
dn™t want to leave there. 
Q: Did he ever Œ 
A: Œ because I would Œ I would get him f
ood, and cigarettes and all that sort of 
thing, and so me Œ and tobacco, and he love
d that. So Œ so Œ an
d then we had other 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
48
people there who knew where the sewers
 w ere, an-and the water, and su pplies like 
that, who had been bordering as well. Fact
, I have pictures of them there in the 
kitchen, and they were Œ they came Œ be
came workers for us. In
 other words, they 
work ed Œ they were working 
fo r me. But they didn™t Œ th ey didn™t get a salary or 
anything, they just got the 
goodies that we could give 
them, that™s all, you know. 
Q: And they  got food. 
A: That™s exactly right, yeah. And wine. 
Q: Now, did you Œ a Œ a lot of people say 
that in those first days when  Œ when  the 
US
 forces came in, and Œ and the starving pris
oners of the Germans, that is the Œ the 
victims Œ 

A: Right. 
Q: Œ of th e concen tration camp who were s
till alive, would ask for food, and they 
would eat it so fast that they would die from Œ 

A: Oh yeah, yeah but Œ 
Q: Yeah, did you Œ did you have 
those types of things happen? 
A: I Œ I didn™t really know. I Œ I Œ I was 
never involved with 
the people that were 
there. I don™t know, I saw them, that™s all.
 Because my work was 
really just in the 
office, in there with 
Alfons
 and some of the other people that were prisoners of the 
Germans, who worked on the water and sewe
r lines and things like that. So we kept 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
49
them on because they knew wh
ere these things were. Otherwise, we wouldn™t have 
known where anything was. And Œ 

Q: Got it. 
A: Œ so we kept them on, and like I said too, the people that I had from 
Berlin
, they 
wouldn™t leave because they 
Œ they again were Œ were sc
ared of the Germans. They 
Œ I mean, they Œ the Russians. 
Q: The Russians. 
A: They Œ they didn™t get 
along at all, not one bit. 
Q: Did 
Alfons
 ever tell you his personal story of 
what happened to  him, and how he 
happened to come into that office? 

A: No, I don™t know how he did it, I have
 no idea how they selected him, or 
anything else. He was just th
ere when I got there, you know. 
Q: Okay . Because it so unds Œ because it 
sounds from what you™re telling me, he 
was in a rather privileged position for a prisoner. 

A: Yeah, he was Œ he was a prisoner of si Œ of the 
SS
. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And as Œ like I say, they pick ed him 
up wh en he was 18 years old, and he was 
there for four years, so he was ab
out my same as Œ age as I was. 
Q: Ah, it™s true. 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
50
A: And we became good friends
. But he was just there. 
But he was there when I 
left. 
Q: Okay . And so  your job was,
 if I can summarize it, if 
I can understand 
it, your job 
was to Œ was to provide the drawings for wh atever renovations had to  be done in the 

camp. 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 renovations are Œ of new buildin
gs, or things of that sort. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But we didn™t have that
 much to do really. Ther
e was a lot of playtime.  
Q: Well, that™s Œ wow.  
A: Yeah. But I Œ I really wasn™t interested
 Œ pardon me Œ I wasn™t inter Œ really 
interested in wh at was going on, the pla Œ 
in the Œ the war crim
es trials, I really 
didn™t care. All I knew was that they had ga
thered them all up in
 these buildings and 
so on, the 
SS
 people, and th ey had their war crim
es trials there. And whoever was 
there, mo st of them were hung. I don™t think Œ 
Q: Tell me, why do you call it a farce? 
A: Pardon? 

Q: Why did you call it a farce? 
I mean, you said that these trials w ere a bit of a 
farce. 
A: Right. 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
51
Q: Why? Why Œ what made 
it that way di Œ for you? 
A: Well, the thing is that nobody wanted Œ 
wanted to talk about their buddies and so 
on, so th at they didn™t really have too mu
ch information. They 
knew that they were 
already there, they knew they
 were guards, because they 
got them out of the guard Œ 
the guard  buildings. So  th-they would Œ on
e prisoner might tell about wh at the other 
guy did, or something like that. But it re
ally didn™t make any difference; if they 
were guards, they were shot, and that was 
it. A lot of them were shot even before 
the war crimes trials came there, and Œ 
the Americans w ere so upset about what 
they saw there, cause they couldn™t un
derstand th at these ki
nd of things were 
happening. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And they just got the guar
ds out of the building, right,
 so one day, the Œ they  let 
the prisoners out of the Œ out of the camp , 
out of Œ th ey cut the wire, and so on, or 
the gates, and let them out. And they went
 up in the towers, and threw these guards 
right out the window, which are like three 
stories high, or something like that. And 
so the Œ some of them were Œ they ga 
Œ the inmates killed 
them. The-There was 
some that I Œ that I never saw man y  women 
that were there, there were some that I 
ti Œ I took a picture of one da
y and Œ but th Œ I don™t k
now wh ere they brought the 
women from, I have no idea. That really wa
sn™t a women™s camp, 
it was mostly for 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
52
men. I think they were brough
t in right befo re the end of 
the war, and the people Œ a 
lot of the women went into 
Da chau
 and smashed the Œ the windows. They  had 
women™s clothing hanging may Œ in there, you 
know, on a Œ some sort of a form or 
some such thing in the wind
ow. And th ey just take the Œ their clothes off, standing 
right there in the window and Œ and put these new clothes on that they got out of the 
Œ out of 
Dachau
 stores. So it was pretty Œ 
Q: I wa Œ I don™t understand this part. 
A: Okay . 
Q: So, former Œ former female prisoners Œ 

A: Right 
Q: Œ in 
Dach au
 Œ 
A: Œ were let go out of the 
camp, so they
 went into 
Dach au
, which is only like a 
half a mile away. 
Q: Oh, the town, okay, 
they went into the 
Dach au
 town. 
A: The stores, that™s right, the town, and 
they just smashed th
e windows if they 
couldn™t get in the store, if the door was locked, they just smashed the windows, and 

standing in there, take all their clo thes 
off, the rags that they
 had on, and put the 
new clothes on that they found, you know, in the windows. 

Q: I see. 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
53
A: But anyway, I Œ I saw one of the gi
rls was mi streat e d  by someone of the 
SS
 
officer, or some such thing. And sh e got 
a knife from a friend of mine and cut his 
testicles off, right there in front of ever
ybody. So, they didn™t ca
re. That™s what I™m 
saying, i-it was just a madhouse. Nobo
dy Œ nobody knew Œ we knew that the 
Americans were in control, and the German
s had to listen to whatever they did. If 
they didn™t listen, they got shot. 
Q: Okay . 
A: It didn™t make any difference. You kno
w, Americans can be cruel, you know, I Œ 
I™ve seen things that Œ that Americans ha
ve done that are just as cruel as any 
German ever did, but Œ 

Q: Can you tell me about that? 
A: Oh yeah, they did Œ they 
Œ th ey were bad news too, some of them. Especially the 
paratroopers. They were just young kids a
nd th ey were Œ they were gung-ho, they  
would kill anybody that they
 can shoot. It didn™t matte
r a Œ a bit. But anyway, 
Dach au
 was a Œ a mess. We got it cleaned up pr
etty well in the year I was there, 
and Œ 

Q: You were there for a whole year? 
A: Oh yeah, I Œ yeah, 
yeah. Yeah, I left Œ  
Q: So you saw a lot in that year? 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson  
 
October 4, 2013 
 

 
 
54
A: Oh yeah, oh goodness yeah. Bu
t then a lot of things I didn™t really want to see, 
you know, I Œ like I say, I didn
™t go to the trials. I never 
went to hangings. I Œ I just 
wanted to get out. You know, I was marrie
d and I wanted to Œ I was just a young 
kid, really, and Œ and this was all new to
 me. I could never imagine these things 
happening; how they  treated other people. 
Q: Tell me about Œ you know, 
you had your camera with 
you, wh at kind of came ra 
was it? 
A: Oh, I don™t know, it™s Œ well, the Germ
ans weren™t allowed to have cameras, 
knives, anything that could hurt an American. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And Œ but 
Alfons
 had his own camera, and that wa
s one of our biggest problems. 
The fil Œ the film we got might have been 
old, and we traded it for cigarettes, or 
candy, or chocolate bars, or something like that. You co uldn™t walk to  the grocery 
store, or Œ or a Œ a drugstore and buy film 
there, there wasn™t a 
such thing. In  other 
words, we get Œ we get film from people
 wh o already had it, and some of it was 
good, and some of it wasn™t. Sometimes you™d give them a Œ a chocolate bar for a Œ 

a box of film, and it was no good, it was al
ready ex posed, as Œ so we got any kind 
of film at all that Œ that 
you could get yo
ur hands on. 
Q: So you had a camera, and he had a 
camera? Both of you had Œ two ki Œ

A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we both
 had, yeah, we were Œ well,
 we were allowed to have 
cameras, but Œ and of course, 
Alfons
, I don™t know where he 
got his camera, I have 
no id ea, cause I Œ he could speak German, 
so he could go out and talk to these 
people in 
Da cha u
 and get things, and he was able
 to bring things back from the 
stores in 
Dachau
 
[indecipherable]
 there, or steal or whatever he could do, you 
know, he™d just take it, you know, cause 
that Œ the Germans would give up anything 
because they Œ they just di
dn™t want to be executed ri
ght there on the spot, yep.

Beginning File Two 
A: Œ yeah , that was a bad year, I™ll tell 
you. I Œ I was glad to get out of there 
[indecipherable]
. 
Q: Well tell me Œ I know, but we™re gonna dwell on it still a little
 bit, I™m sorry to 
say, because there are more questions. 
When you tell me th
ings, that Œ more 
questions about it Œ 

A: That™s okay. I don™t mind. 
Q: Okay . So  you would get ou Œ you woul
d get the film, but 
not everybody would 
want to take pictures. What made you wa
nt to take pictures of what you were 
seeing? Cause in the photo al
bum you™re donating to us Œ 
A: Well, what it actually Œ well, everybody Œ 
Alfons
 did the same t h ing, you know, 
we™d pi Œ take a picture of the gate, or Œ 
or the Œ or people lining the Œ in the Œ th-
the Œ the cadavers were lying in the Œ th
e Œ the Œ the pick-up trucks. We were Œ 
maybe we thought it was going to be evid
en ce sometime , y-you know, that maybe 
somebody would want it, that™s
 all. There was really no r
eason to Œ to take pictures, 
it was just that we wanted to do it, I gue
ss for our own use later on. And Œ but I had 
those pictures laying at home for years, a
nd never looked at them an yway. I Œ I Œ 
Q: Tell me, how did you 
develop them there?

A: Oh, 
Alfons
, for some reason or other, he was able
 to do this in his office. I don™t 
know how he did it, where he got the film
. I mean, he had a little closet like where 
he would develop th ese film for me, and for him. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And that™s the only two cam
eras that were in the offi
ce, you know, just his and 
mine. And then we™d  get film all different sizes. A lot of times you couldn™t use it 

anyway, because it was 
Œ you know, it was expo
sed, or whatever. 
Q: Were there any pictures that you took th
at didn™t get developed because the films 
Œ 

A: Oh my heaven s, y
eah, loads of them. Oh, the film 
wasn™t any good, a lot of it, 
you know, and Œ and so how 
would we know? We didn™t
 know, you put it in the 
camera and then it came out
 black, or whatev er 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Cause there was no color, it was all bl
ack and white, and yo
u know, th Œ the 
film. we™d Œ we™d borrow the film, you 
know, we Œ if we Œ we™d go into 
Dach au
 
and talk to these people who we heard ma
ybe had film. And then  we™d say, well, 
we™ll Œ we™ll give you maybe Œ 
I couldn™t speak German because 
Alfons
 could, so 
he was always the interprete
r. So anyway, he would get 
[indecipherable]
 these 
people wh o had film, and th en we™d give
 them whatever we had to give them,

maybe 
C
-rations, or whatever it was, just for 
the film, because th
ey wanted to sell 
it. They wanted our Œ our th ings. They  Œ th
ey considered our bread as Œ as cak e, and 
I liked their bread better, because it was dark
 bread. But our Œ all the fellows that I 
had in th e office, they le Œ really liked our
 bread. They thought 
it was cake at times, 
cause it was white. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And theirs is dark. Bu
t I liked the dark bread. 
Q: Well, people do say it™s healthier than Œ than white bread. 

A: Pardon? 

Q: People say that dark bread 
is healthier than white bread. 
A: Oh, I Œ that™s what I understand so, y
eah. Oh, I Œ I used to Œ I loved that stuff, 
yeah. We Œ we™d gallons of
 Œ of peanut butter and grap e jelly, and I™d put that 
peanut butter and grape jelly on this dark
 bread; that was really good, you know. 
But if you didn™t have anything else to 
eat, I guess that was all right. But Œ but we 
had Œ we had 
[indecipherable]
 rations. Then after the Americans came in, they 
opened up the kitchen, and then  we had go
od food that we knew Œ that was there. 
Well, I rememb er the Œ the Thanksgiving th at
 we were there, I went over to the Œ 
where the other Americans were, where they
 were eating in the dining room, and it 
was Than ksgiving day, and somebody Œ one 
of the cooks in Œ American cooks told

one of the German assistants to go get th
e salt. Anyway, he go
t the Œ the soap sud Œ 
the soap powder, and put 
that in the mashed potatoes. And Œ and ev erybo Œ 
everybody was standing 
out in the hall, they 
gotta get in the toilet 
[indecipherable]
 
down  Œ down th e aisle there, you know, and fortunately I didn™t eat any of the 
mashed potatoes. I Œ I Œ I was really glad 
I didn™t after that, I™ll tell y ou. But these 
guys were standing out th
ere Œ somebody had gone in th
eir pants, and ev erything 
else, you know. I didn™t Œ they were ea
ting soap in th eir mashed potatoes. 
Q: Oh my God. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oh my God. 
A: Aw, it was Œ but I Œ I say, you know, it was a rat race. It was just th Œ it was n Œ 
everything was turmoil, you know, for mont
hs, because there was really not that 
much instruction on what 
to do. All we wanted to
 do was get rid of the 
SS
. 
Q: And they  did. 
A: You know, get rid of the offi Œ get rid 
of the officers, get rid of the people who 
mistreated all these people fo
r years, and just get rid of them, you know, and that 
was it. And I guess we each had our own little
 places to be, and that™s where we 
stayed, and we didn™t Œ we didn™t make it 
Œ any noise anywhere, 
because if you did, 
you Œ you™d get into  the trouble.
 So we Œ we didn™t really Œ

Q: So you felt Œ you felt that, you know, gi 
Œ if I can summarize 
this in the way I 
understand it. 
A: Okay . 
Q: Is that Œ that Œ when we™re talking 
about those war crime 
trials, and what you 
mean is trials that took 
place within the camp of 
Da cha u
, for the camp of 
Da chau
. 
A: That™s correct, that™s all. 
Q: That™s all it was Œ  
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ it never went to 
Nuremberg
 or anything else? 
A: Oh no, no, no, these Œ th
is was just to handle the people that were Œ that were 
officers or guards there in 
Dach au
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ the little people, not 
Œ no-no-nothing outside. 
Q: And these German form
er guards and Œ and camp 
managers and so on Œ 
A: Right, right. 

Q: Œ were not talking Œ were not telling on one another. 

A: Oh, that™s correct, that wa Œ 
Q: In other word s, they wouldn™t provide any evidence? 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

61
A: No, nad Œ no info rmation about some
body else. Maybe one time, maybe that 
somebody didn™t like the other guy, or some
thing like that, he would say, well, he 
did this or th at, or he Œ he mistreated 
somebody, or something 
like that. Well, that 
was only recorded, and that 
was it. So it ended up mos
tly everybody was either 
hung or shot or whatever anyway , it didn™t make any difference. 
Q: Were these executions ta
king place on a daily basis? 

A: Oh su re, yeah, after Œ after the thing 
got started right, yeah, because there was 
like Œ there were dozen s of Œ of guards th
ere, and the commandant and so on. And Œ 
and all these people, they had alot of officers 
there, from the 
SS
, and they were all 
tried there, right there at 
Dachau
. 
Q: Did any of the prisoners though, that 
they had mistreated, stay around to give 

testimony, or were they  gone? 

A: No, they Œ most of them were try to 
get out of the place. 
They didn™t Œ they Œ 
they might have said some things about maybe certain one
s that they were Œ they 
were mishandled  by, but Œ but they  ne Œ th
ey are Œ there was Œ wasn™t much Œ there 
were Œ there really wasn™t much discussionabout the prisoners. They were just glad 

to get out of that fence, and get out of th
em barracks. They would sleep anywhere in 
the build ings, or wh erever they could, 
you know, summer Œ was warm at the time, 
cause we got there in May, 
and then we got summer, but 
then in wintertime it got

cold, and but bo Œ most of the people were 
gone a Œ after I left Œ I mean, they were 
gone before I left, really. 
Q: I was going to ask you th at, I was gonna Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah, most of them Œ well, the 
ones that had someplace to go, or the ones 
that could walk, they  would go. Otherwise, 
you couldn™t go, they ju st had to stay 
there, and we fed them, whatever we coul
d do with them, til th
ey finally did go. 
Q: I see. 
A: But they may have had friends or so
mebody, maybe they knew somebody, or 
they Œ they™d just walk in
to houses and throw the people
 out, you know, take over 
the house, you know, they 
were Œ pardon me, prisoners for Œ of the Germans for a 
while, and they just wanted to
 get out of the camp , just 
get out of there quickly as 
they could. 
Q: So, in the local town of 
Da chau
, they would Œ there we
re former prisoner who 
would go and Œ 
A: Oh yeah, they Œ 
Q: Œ empty out from Œ 

A: Oh su re, that™s right, they Œ you bet th
ey did. And I Œ I understand now though, 
that a lot of of those people who were th
e Œ most of them are gone, th ey wouldn™t Œ 
there was no discussion about 
what happened with any of 
these people. But the-they

were going to 
Da cha u
 and they ™d  steal food, or wh at
ever, they Œ they™d just knock 
people down  and take whatev
er they had. They Œ yo-you 
walk into  the houses, hey, 
they were prisoners there, so
 why Œ they were glad to ge
t out. So  Œ so they had no 
idea what Œ what was going to  be happening to
 them or anything else. So they Œ I Œ 
I could understand, if you were in 
Dachau
 and you were from 
Poland
, you had a 
long way to go to get back to where Œ a
nother country. And we had people there 
from 31 different countries. So, lo
rd, they came from all around, 
Austria  
[indecipherable] 
you know, and who knows where.
 There were no Americans 
there that I know of, none at all.  
Q: You Œ you Œ did you ever
 have any personal inte
raction with any of the 
prisoners, aside from 
Alfons
? 
A: Not really, other than what
 walked into my office, th
at™s all, I had Œ I had no 
other contact.  

Q: But I meant Œ 
A: I couldn™t speak German anyway. 
Q: I™m not talking about the Germ
an prisoners of the Americans. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: I™m talking about the prisoners of the 
Germans. That is, when you s Œ the Œ the 
people wh o had been in  
Da cha u
 fo r four or five years as prisoners.

64
A: Yeah, right. 
Q: Did you have any contact with those,
 with the victims of the concentration 
camp? 
A: Not really, no, because I couldn™t spea
k their languages, and 
I didn™t know what 
they were saying anyway. 
Q: I see. 

A: You know, si Œ if somebody was 
Poland
, I didn™t know what they were saying. 
We had some Polish fellows working there, 
and they  ended up Œ th
ey Œ they started 
to speak some English. Or 
Alfons 
Œ mo st of those were Œ were
 friends of his, and he 
Œ they were all from Œ from 
Poland
, so they knew how to 
get along with each other, 
and then  
Alfons
 would translate w h at they said to 
me, i-in Œ in English. So th at was 
a big help  to me, let me tell you. I w Œ I 
wouldn™t Œ I don™t know
 how I could have 
ever operated there without him being there.
 I cou Œ I couldn™t have done it, no 
how. 

Q: And Œ and his name, if I 
want to say it again, is 
Kanarek
, 
k-a-n-a-r-e-k
, 
something like that? His last name? 
Alfons™
? 
A: I don™t know. I Œ I know it started with a 
K

Kamyczek
(ph). 
Alfo ns Kamyczek

A: And I never had any contact with him afte
r we left there. Like I say, he was still 
there when I left. So I Œ I 
have no idea, I don™t know hi

from Œ from others Œ pardon me, 
Erkar
(ph),
 
from 
Hungary
, who was a prisoner of 
ours who would come in and clean up my  Œ 
my  bedroom, and clean the office, and 
he would Œ if any cigarettes we
re Œ cigarette butts were around, he™d tear them apart 
and save the tobacco. He™d put them in 
a bag, and Œ to take back to Œ to 
Hungary
. 
And he did write me, 
Erkar
(ph), he had my  address, and how he did it, I don™t 
know, but he had my  address Œ 
Q: And he wrote to you. 

A: Œ and he used to write he Œ to me, to

me Œ he™d send me stamps and stuff like that. He was a postman in 
Hungary

Q: Well, tell me Œ yeah. Tell me about wh

since you bring th at 
up. You were writing to your wife
 and sending her pictures Œ 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Œ of what you saw. Did you explain in 
your letters what it was, where you were, 
and what kind of a place it was? 
A: Never. She just knew where I was. It was an 
AP O
 numb er, so she didn™t really 
know wh ere I was, she™d only 
see these pictures, you know Œ 
Q: Did she ask you about them? 

A: Œ and I told her Œ I told her I was in 
Dachau

to upset her, beca Œ tell her where I was, b
ecause she didn™t know if I was a prisoner 
or not, or wh at I was, you know, I was ju

know, sometimes you get a whole stack of le

A: I got Œ I gotta say, it was Œ it was 
somewhat turmoil, you know. Nobody Œ 
nobody knew who did what. 
Q: Why is it Œ I mean, I know th at in 
some ways it sounds like it Œ it should be 
obvious, but why is it that yo
u wanted to get out of there 
so badly, out of that Œ out 
of that Œ 
A: Why did I want to get out? 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Because I was just married, and one Œ ye
ah, I mean, I wanted to just get home, 
that™s all. I saw enough
, you know, and knowing Œ I didn™t mind too mu ch  the 
travel, or wherever barracks, and so on
, or the buzz bombs and stuff like this. I 
didn™t Œ that didn™t bother me. After I got to
 the camp  Œ and I didn™t dr Œ I didn™t 
have bad conditions there, I had a real
 nice bedroom 
and Œ and I c
ould get food 
whenever I wanted it, because Americans 
were in charge. I didn™t Œ it Œ it really 
wasn™t a hardship for me. In 
other words, I knew I had to 
stay there, and that was it. 
So nobody ever Œ nobody 
ev er said anything about wh at I should do, or Œ 
Q: You had no co mma nding officer? 
A: No. And I was a lowly serg
eant, yeah, yeah, ye-yeah.

Dachau
 camp? 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

71
A: Oh, they brought a couple different pe
ople in, different times over that year. 
Things were moving so fast. The war Œ th
e wa Œ when  Œ when  the Americans got to 
Dach au
, and they had been to 
Munich
, they were then movi
ng on to southern 
Germany
. In other words, they we
re trying to get down where 
Hitler
 was, down in  
the Œ in the 
Alps
 mountains. There Œ that™s where th
ey were trying to get him. So, 
after they moved Œ they left only a cert
ain amount of Œ maybe it was only a hundred 
Americans there, for that year
 that I was there. The rest
 of them were already in 
battle, they were go-going, 
trying to get to southern 
Germ any
, get the war over 
with. 
Q: So they thought Œ 
so  they thought that 
Hitler
 was in southern 
Germany
, but in 
truth, he was in 
Berlin
. 
A: Yeah, but he was Œ no, he Œ 

Q: 
Hitler
 was in

trying to  get there where his house 
[indecipherable]
 was down there. 
Q: Oh yeah. That™s right, 
Berchtesgaden 
was right there, okay. 
A: That™s right. They didn™t Œ they were
 trying to get down th ere, and Œ the 
Americans were, to finish the war 
off, because they 
knew that the Œ 
Austria
 was 
right beyond that. We didn™t wa
nt to Œ we didn™t care about 
Austria
, we just wanted

to get 
Germ any
, and get everybody killed out ther
e we could kill, 
you know, that 
was it. We wanted to get out. Ever
ybody wanted out, that was it. 
Q: So tell me Œ tell me this, I ask ed this 
earlier. The end of the war was May eighth, 
I believe, or May ninth, one of th ose two days, ™45. 

A: Yeah, ™45, but Œ 

Q: Right. So you had been in 
Da chau
 nine, 10 days by that point. 
A: Oh su re.

office at 
Dachau
, you know, it wasn™t Œ 
Q: It didn™t matter to you. 

A: No, no, it was nothing. It was just 
over, you know. Everybody was happy about 
it, but we had to get rid of all these people
, we had to get into 
the war crimes trials, 
a-and all these things were 
going on th ere. So Œ and to  me
, I didn™t really care what 
was going on, I just wanted out.

A: No, never. I was always there. 

Q: Okay . 
A: I remember when I went down there one 
day for that guy to lo ok at that Œ that 
chateau in the mo untains, that
 ski run. Sir Œ he says 300 do
llars, and look at all this 
space. Oh my God, I thought
, oh jeez. The guy can™t possi
bly alo Œ believe this is 
worth 600 dollars, but yeah, yeah. Well, 300 
dollars would have been  thousan ds to 
them, oh yeah. 
Q: And after Œ right after the war, that™s a different story. 

A: Oh yeah, sure. Oh yeah. 
But see, I Œ I Œ I was smart enough to know Œ I was just 
Œ just a kid, but I was smart enough to

anyway, you know. That wa Œ that was t
oo far-fetched for me, that Œ that was way 
over my  head.  

Q: Tell me now, when Œ wh
en you finally did leave 
Dachau
, was that April 1946 or 
May 1946? 

A: Yeah, it was Œ I got Œ I got out in Ap ril of Œ of ™46.

A: Well, we Œ we just took little tours. 
One of my Œ one of my American friends 
was supposed to collect food
 for the prisoners over ther
e, which was a farce. And 
anyway, somehow he finagled a German co
mmand car, one of them big, open  jobs 
that th Œ that the Germans had. And we had a Œ an 
SS 
officer and a 
Wehrmacht 
soldier. And the four of us used to take 
trips, and we were looking for food. So  
anyway, these two guys th
ere, the Œ the German 
SS
 offer Œ and th e funny th ing was 
that he was from 
Hanover
, 
Germ any
. His family had owned a Œ a Œ a Œ wh eat 
mills and so on, they were grinders, they
 grind up for Œ for food, and so  on. And I 
asked him one day how 
he Œ he could speak English, 
and he said Œ I asked him how 
he Œ he got into the service, and the 
SS
. And he said, well, 
Hitler
 said, like the Boy 
Scouts were Œ had to go in this type of 
service, and Œ and the Girl Scouts were over

here, and Œ and these groups were over, bu
t a Œ he put them in important positions, 
but he ended up in the 
SS
. And anyway, we used to ta
ke these trips down to the 
mountain Œ in the mo untains, in the 
Alps
, the four of us. The Œ the werman Œ 
German 
Wehrmach t 
guy, he would Œ he 
would drive, and so metimes I™d sit in the 
back with this 
SS
 officer, who we got out of the ca
mp. We were able to take him 
out wi Œ you know, get in the Œ 
Q: So, he wasn™t tried?
 He wasn™t somebody Œ 
A: Oh no, no, he wasn™t Œ I don™t know how
 he got out, but he did. The both of 
them got out. Maybe I helped th em, I don™
t know, but anyway , wa Œ but we can Œ 
we used to take trips any time down 
the mountains. And 
this one guy, the 
SS
 
officer, he knew some German general™s wife
 that lived down there, I forget what 
the town  was, but it was occupied by the Fr
ench. And they brough
t all these French 
Moroccans out of 
Africa
, up there to the occupation army . And th e Œ and I 
reme mb er we were standing up there high in
 the window, we were looking down at 
these people, and these guys in their r
obes, and so on. And the Œ th e Americans 
used to bring meat out there, big legs of 
lamb and stuff like that
. And they have in 
the truck Œ there was no Œ there was no cooling Œ

A: No refrigera Œ they just brought it in 
trucks, they throw it on the ground, and no 
Œ these guys would pick  it up, they ™d take it 
away and they just at
e it, and so on. But 
we™d stand up in  this wo m Œ this wo man™s 
house, and we™d look down, see this stuff 

going on. But yeah, they
 Œ they a Œ they had hardly 
finagled that car Œ I Œ I still 
don™t know how they  ever got that
 car, I don™t know. But my  friend 
Davros
(ph) 
asked me along. We went to a Œ a funny part, we went to a 
Kraft 
cheese factory one 
day, and got cheese. Another place this
 guy knew, whoever, c
ould get eggs. Why 
we did it, I don™t know. I don™t know what
 we ever did with 
this stuff anyway. 
A2: This is after that happened, right? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Is this after 
Dachau
, or is this while you™re in 
Dach au
? 
A: Oh yeah, we tha Œ while we were in 
Dachau
, yeah, yeah. I don™t know where 
they got the car from, I guess it was from one 
of the officers had this car there. It 
was a big 
[indeciphera ble]
 job that was really nice. 
Big convertible. We™d ride 
around in  that thing, oh yeah . 

Q: Well, tell me about something else, caus
e you alluded to it before. It sounds like 
there was a pretty thriving black market going on after the war.

Q: I see.

, but place where you co uld buy stuff. 
Q: A commissary? 

A: Yeah, right Œ well, it was Œ wa Œ it was 
Œ it really wasn™t Œ that headquarters, 
they just had it like a little 
room, with stuff in it, you

that. They  may have had cigars, 
or pipes, or yo
u know, things 
[indecipherable]
 
guys smoke with or Œ or wh atever. They might Œ 

Q: So was it worth an ything, this Œ this printed money? 

A: Oh yeah, it was Œ 
Q: I mean, worth anything that you c
ould buy that was wor Œ that was the Œ

Q: You mean Œ talking about the old 
Reichsmark
?  
A: I Œ like we Œ when we 
[indecipherable]
 that money wasn™t 
any good to anybody 
really. It was just a so uvenir. I se Œ I 
Œ I used to send money back, I had some 
million dollar bills and so on from Œ from th e bank, and I™d send them to my wife 

home, cause her uncle used to save the stuff 
from different countries. He™d save this 
money th at Œ you know, if guys would send him, cause he had a restaurant and Œ 
and Œ and they™d Œ they™d 
send him money back. So I sent him a million dollar bill 
one day. That was a Œ

Reichsmark 
bill, like Œ

™t Œ it wasn™t anything anyway . 
Q: Right. 
A: It was just a souvenir really. Just a piece of paper. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah, well, it was useless really. 

Q: Well, about Œ so the Œ so you were able 
to exchange real dollars for this sort of 
printed American Œ

A: Oh yeah, I could take my  mo ney, Amer
ican money, and I could deposit. I could 
send it back, we had like a post office that 
we could go to. It wasn™t really a post 
office, but you could take your stuff there. And we coul
d exch ange that money, we 
could put it in the book, and 
then we get that, I could se
nd that home. Yeah. But like 
I say, they only Œ I only got five dollars
, my wife got the rest of it. I guess 
[indecipherable]
 we had 30 dollars a month, a dollar a day we got, yeah. 
Q: And so you would ke
ep five for yourself and send 25 home. 
A: Yeah, well, she was Œ yeah, she was work

soldiers, 
US
 soldiers involved in
 in the black market? 
A: Really nothing, they ju
st Œ they  would gamb le money. They™d  gamb le it to get 
the money, that™s all. T h at™s how they
 got the money, you know, was mo stly 
gamb ling. Oh, some of them used to go to  Œ to  
Switzerland
 and buy cheap watches, 
and sell them to the Russians for a high pr
ice. And Œ and anyway Œ and th ey all Œ 
the Russian money wasn™t worth anyt
hing, I don™t know why they  ever Œ

Q: Why? 
A: In fact, I Œ my  neighbor down the str
eet h ere, he met some Russians, and he

Œ I don™t know, they 
had their lifestyle, I 
guess, and us Œ and we Œ we 
couldn™t Œ we couldn™t get alon

A: Not very much. I think it™s after Œ afte
r the war crimes people got out, a lot of it 
was torn down, like I said about this man 
telling me a lot of Œ a lot of buildings 
were disposed of. They took all the Œ they

were Œ well, they has spent a lot of time 
there maybe, and they  Œ they were too conf
used, they didn™t kn
ow where to go. And 
they couldn™t walk, a lot of them couldn™t walk. So I think even
tually they took 
these people back. Th
ey just put them on American 
trucks and to ok them wherever 
they wanted  to go, or something like that
. That™s what I understood, anyway, but I 
wasn™t there when they did that, I don™

somehow, you had 30,000 pe
ople, that™s a lot of pe
ople, let me tell y ou. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: And they  had to get rid of them. So, 
the Americans didn™t wa

drink wine. That™s about all, yeah. 
Q: So tell me how Œ who gave you th
e order that you could actually leave 
Dachau
? 
How did that happen? 

A: You know, I don™t know
. Somebody Œ there was 
some there Œ well, the 
American officers were there, and some guy 
came in to Œ on the office one day and 

told me that I could leave. I was the only 
American there, of course. So, he said, get 
your things and Œ and come 
down to headquarters. And th

went to 
Munich
 and got on a train, and went to Œ to 
Bremerhaven
, and that was it. 
They  gave us a ca Œ a quart of 
Four Roses
 whiskey when we got on the train. And 
the train was real cold because it™s Œ it™s three guys sit here, a
nd three people over 
here, it™s l i k e Œ well, you know how they ar
e, the coaches with, I think there™s six 

people or something like that. 

Q: Sort of like separate compartments. 
A: Yeah. And I drank all my booze, I™m ta
king all my clothes off, I™m getting hot. 
These here guys are all sitting there freezi

were Œ this whiskey warmed me u p , because 
that™s the first I ever had any whi Œ any 
booze. Bu t you know, I ha Œ the other

thing. I never got any of that stuff. We 
got Œ when we got on the train, somebody 
handed me a bottle of whiskey, and that wa
s it. That™s the only 
thing I ever got from 
anybody. We got a Œ a pack of
 cigar Œ I mean, a carton of
 cigarettes a week, that™s 
why everybody used to smoke. 
But we got tobacco for a pipe or so mething like that, 
once in a wh ile. But I never got anything 
that was given to me, other than that 
whiskey 
[indeciphera ble] 
on the train.

were on a troop ship . 
Q: On a troop sh ip. 
A: What happened, it was a freighter, r
eally. The Œ the Amer
icans would take 
German prisoners, and bring them back to the 
USA
 to work over here, on farms, in 
factories and stuff like that. They were really the fortunate ones, th
at when that ship 
came back, they™d brin
g these prisoners back , the German prisoners back. It was all 
painted, it was really Œ everything was nice and clean fo r us. So , we came back on ji 
Œ on Œ got on th e ship, and, in fact I have 
a picture in that book, of me standing on 
the boat. And it took about 10 days to get 
home, I think we hit a storm or some thing

coming back. Bu t it was on a 
troop ship, but it was nice and clean, cause the 
Germans had painted everything, and it was,
 you know, it was neat. So they  were 
using 
[indecipherable]
 in the 
States
. But then I heard a lot of stories about 
prisoners back here that Œ German prison
ers that were pretty well treated some Œ 
back here, I™ll tell you. They
 had good Œ they didn™t 
have to work  on farms and 
factories and stuff. In fact two guys over 
here the other day, they were telling me 
about some of the prisoners that were Œ 
they knew people here
 who had taken care 
of them, you know, and bro
ught them back
. So they Œ 
Q: And where did you sail in to? 
A: 
New York
. We left from 
New York
 on the 
Queen Elizabeth
, that took us five 
days to get there. It was really fast. That
 ship traveled alone, 
it didn™t go in a co nvoy 
like all the others. 

Q: The 
Queen Elizabeth
 was the ship you came back on? 
A: No, no Œ 
Q: That™s the ship Œ 
A: Œ we came back on a troop ship . 

Q: Oh a Œ that™s what I thought. 
A: Yeah, right, a freighter. But we went over on Œ

A: Œ there were 21,000 
G

I
.s on there, and Œ and 4,000
 crew and 4,000 civilians 
were on that ship. 
Q: On 
Queen Elizabeth
? 
A: Yeah, right. Go ing over. 

Q: Going to Œ uh-huh. 

A: Going over. I never saw such a big ship
 in my life before we saw it. Well, I 
never saw a ship before. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But anyway, we got on there, and boy if
 a Œ a torped o had ev
er hit that thing, 
they™d  a lost a lot of people, let me  tell you. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But it would zigzag like this, it Œ it goe
s like that across the 
ocean, because every 
six minutes the ship would chan ge cour
se, because it took seven minutes for a 
German submarine to get on target. And th
at™s why th ey Œ they™d  zigzag. And the 
last night out, before we came up the 
Firth of Clyde
, that ship was really bouncing 
back and forth, because they
 said they had a Œ a Œ a no
tice that may b e there was a 
submarine close by, so there was Œ that was really a bounce around, but it was a 
nice ride. We went over in August, it wa
s beautiful weather. And then we Œ we 
stayed up on deck most of the time. I slept on deck al
most every night, because I

knew I was down in  
D
 deck, so I Œ I never Œ I™d never 
get out of there. That was a Œ 
that was a full ship, let me tell you. All 
them bigdini
ng rooms were filled up with 
del Œ double decker c-cots. Some of them 
were three and Œ three high, you had to  
climb up there to get to them. I was fortuna
te, I had a nice cot down in Œ somebody 
was above me, I think, in Œ 
in one the state rooms. A ni
ce ship, a big ship, let me 
tell you. A big boat. 
Q: And when you got into 
New Yo rk 
harbor, having come back, did your wife 
meet you there? 

A: Oh no, oh no, no. 
I had to go down  to 
New Jersey
 to a Œ a de-depot there, an 
army  camp, where some guy was Œ he™d  
Œ he was gonna sign 
us out. And he had 
only been  the Œ in th e service about two m
onths, I think it was, and he said, don™t 
you want to join the Œ th e National Guard or
 Œ or the reserves? I said hell no, if you 
want to join , you go ahead and join. Let 
me tell you right now, I™ve had all the army  

I want. Yeah, he Œ he Œ he wanted  me to 
sign up, I said no way. I™m not signing up 
for nothing, let me tell
 you. Nope. I ca Œ I came back 
on Œ then we got a train out of 
somewhere in 
New Jersey
 Œ no, I got a bus to 
Philadelphia
, and th en we got a train 
from 
Philadelphia
 to 
Lancaster
,
 Pennsylvania
. And Œ and the Œ the car, th-the car

Really antiquated. Oh God, I can™t believe
 that something like 
that happened. But 
that™s the way it was, you know, yeah. 
Q: And so your wife met you in 
Lancaster
? 
A: No way. 

Q: No. 

A: No. We had 
[indecipherable]
 on th e third floor apartment, and I got a Œ a taxi to 
go home. Nobody th ere 
[indecipherable]
 me,  no, nobody. Hell, 
nobody was there. I 
came home alone, yeah . 

Q: Was she surprised to see you? 

A: Sure was. She sure was surprised.  I told her I was going to come home 
sometime, you know. Hell, we didn™t ha
ve a telephone, and I Œ nobody had 
telephones, nobody Œ I didn™t buy a c 
Œ I gotta borro w a car. Some guy was there 
with me. He worked in a ga Œ in a 
Chry sler
 garage in 
York
, so he told me to buy a 
ca Œ a used car, cause cars weren™t made 
during the war, and th ey Œ they only had 
the cars before the war, and they started 
making th em after the war, but wa Œ there 
was Œ there was all used cars. And I had a big 
Chrysler
, some beer magnate from 
York
, he owned the car, and he traded in 
fo r something else. And I could actually 
lay out in  the trunk of the car, was a one
-seater. I could lay out this way, not 
sideways, I could la Œ 

 
Interview with NormanCoulson

93
Q: But lengthwise. 
A: Œ that™s how Œ how big the trunk was, 
I could stretch out like that, that™s how 
big. 
Beth
(ph) said,
 
what in the world do you want with
 this kind of big car? I said, 
it™s just a car, that™s all. Ju
st something to drive around
, you didn™t have anything. 
We sold our Œ we had a new 
Na sh
 that we bought right before Œ about two Œ when  I 
w Œ I worked in 
Baltimore
 and Œ and we had this 
Na sh
, and we sold it a couple 
hours before, cause she couldn™t drive, so we
 sold it a couple of hours right before I 
went in the service. S-
So, we had that money. 

Q: So tell me about your post-war years. 

A: Pardon? 
Q: Tell me a little bit about the post-war ye
ars. Where did you 
start working when 
you came back? 
A: When I came back? 

Q: Mm. 
A: Okay. I went back to my ol
d buddy. We built a house here in 
Hanover
, and I 
went back  with my  old architect friend 
here down town, who 
I had known before 
that Œ before I got in. And I went with 
him for a couple of years, I guess it was. 
Then I got my license in
 1950, and I Œ I was registered in five states: 
New York
, 
New Jersey
, 
Delaware

that years ago, I didn™t need it. But Œ 
Q: And so, did you go out 
on your own then , or Œ 
A: Oh yeah, I always had my own office, al
ways. I did work for other people, then I 
did work for a 
Baltimore
 firm when they were doing the 
Baltimore 
City Hall. 
Things like that, that sort of nice projec
ts, yeah. And then  I started getting in to Œ 
into Œ into medical 
buildings, hospitals, 
[indecipherable]
 homes, retirement homes, 
that sort of thing. 

Q: So mostly it was commercial b u ild
ings rather than residential?

A: Everybody was doing so meth
ing, you know, and they  we

thing Œ I Œ I designed every fa Œ house in th

New Jersey
 and

big riding arenas, stuff like that. He didn™t wa

New Jersey
, I did all her farm b u ildings, and 
then she had a big riding arena, and sh e

 drop over dead, you know. 
They were half dead to st-s
tart with, and you had to pi
ck them up. Or there were 
these Œ these barracks, you have pictures 
of those Œ those beds
 that were woo Œ 
made of wood. There was no pa
ds or nothing on them, you 
know, and if they were Œ 
if they were there, and they didn™t move
, they were considered dead. Cause we 
didn™t have anybody that c
ould know. We didn™t have an

to do. You just pick

Put them in the big Œ like a Œ

 I got them back from him, you know,
