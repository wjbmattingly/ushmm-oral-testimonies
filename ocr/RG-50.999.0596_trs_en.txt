Suzy Snyder:  T hank you, very m uch, Halina. Can you hearm e?  Can you 
hear me up 
there?  Okay. T hank you so muchfor being here today.  Halina is
 
--
 
I've known Halina a very 
long tim e, so
 
--
 
but Ialwa ys f indout new things ever y tim e I go over your history, which is 
actually ver y nice for me.  But I wantedto have you startoff by talking about what your 

childhood was like in the m id to late '30s, before 1938?
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, I can't rem em ber that
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder: W hat you can remember.
 
Halina Peabody:  Before 1938 I was very, ver y young.  As I said,asyou told,my
 
--
 
I 
was about six and ahalf whenthe war brokeout.W e were livin g in a small town called 

Zaleszc zyki and m yf ather was a dentist so he had a surgery in thefront of the house. W e 

were li ving in the back.  Thebeautif ultown wit h a river alm ost com pletely surrounding it.  My 

m other hadbeen a cham pion swim mer, so she loved the water and she would do water
-
s k iin g 
and we used to
 
--
 
we used to paddle aroundon the water theref rom
 
--
 
there were two 
beaches.W e would gofrom  one to theother, a sunny beach
 
and a shady beach.  And as I 
said, lif e was good.  T he weather wasf antastic.  My m other was anall
-
around sportswom an, 
so she taught me to skate whenI was f ive.  My f ather, who decided thatbefore kindergarten I 

hadto learn to read the paper because I was thef irst so I had to bethe good pupil. So I
 
--
 
I 
never
 
--
 
I never rem ember anything that, youknow
 
--
 
knowin g how to read Polishor write 
Polish because he taught m e so early so as I said Idon't rem em berany of  it. Inaddition to 

that, m y mother taught m e toembroiderand to knitand crochet. Soas a young childI was 

ver y luck y.  I had toys,I had bicycles and tricycles.  So m y mother took wonderf ul care of us.  

She knitted everything I had on.  So we had a wonderful lif e. And Iwas just about t
o  go  t o 
kindergarten whenthe war broke out. 
 
Suzy Snyder:  So letme back up a little bit and ask, were your parents practicing Jews?
 

Halina Peabody:  No, they were liberal.  My f ather camef rom a religious family.  My 
m other cam ef rom  a liberal f am ily.  T hat's why sheand all her siblings went to Polish schools 

and she
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder:  As opposed to Jewish schools.
 
Halina Peabody:  Not Jewish, just Polish general schools.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Did they speak Yiddish in thehom e?
 
Halina Peabody:  No,becausem y m other did not speak Yiddish. My f atherdidbutm y 
m other did not.
 
Suzy Snyder:  You said your father was a dentist. W hat was he like? W hat kindof  
person was he like?
 
Halina Peabody:  He wasfun.  He was a great, great jokerand was
 
--
 
he was ver y, ver y 
fond of m e and he didn't like it whenm y m other tried to discipline me.
 

3 
 
(Laughter)
 
Suzy Snyder:  Your sis ter was younger than you by six years, yes?
 
Halina Peabody:  Six and a half, yes.
 
Suzy Snyder: W hat was it like when she was born,for you, what was that like, being 
the center of everyone's attention and then suddenly
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  No,no,no, it wasn't like that at all.  No, no, we waitedfor her.  I was 
ver y anxious to have a brother or sisterand rem emberm y m other
 
--
 
I said why she had this 
big tumm y, and she said you're going to have a brotheror sister.  So shepreparedm efor that. 

My m other always told m ethetruth and therewas never any
 
--
 
any f eeling that she would be 
taking m y interest, no.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.
 
Halina Peabody:  I really was like a secondmother to her.  Basically through the rest of 
the war.
 
Suzy Snyder:  But shewas born right bef ore the war broke out, right?
 

Halina Peabody:  Shewas two m onths whether the war broke out, yes.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So canyou describe what that was like, what you rem em ber aboutthat?
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, I remember that m y motherhad great troubles because there 
was som e problem  withf eeding and she suffered a lot with that. She was
 
--
 
m y sist e r wa s 
ver y sm all anda little sickly, and the war was com ing on then when
 
--
 
when '39 cam e around, 
when we knew that the Russians were com ing, we knew that the men would seem tobe in 

greater danger than the wom en, at leastthatwas the understanding.  So my f ather with som e 

other people, some with f am
ilies, som e without, went over to Romania because the river was a 
naturalf rontier with Rom ania. And the men were af raid of being conscripted into the rationed 

Arm y which is what they thought because of thef irst world war that's what they did. Never 

o cc
urred to them  that wom en and children wouldhave any problem.  So he just left.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So it was really m ore about protecting your father than anything at that 
point.
 
Halina Peabody:  Right.  And then leaving m y m other with the two of us.  Yes.
 
S u zy
 
Snyder:  And you rem em ber it being particularly diff iculton your m other, having a 
newborn, having you?
 
Halina Peabody:  I did.  I did.  Andthat's why I'm  saying, you know, it was more taking 
care of the baby andmy m otherbecause shewas
 
--
 
I became her
 
support.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So what happenedto yourfather, hetried to
 
--
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, af terafew weeks, I know exactl y how m any, buteverything was 
f rozenover.  The river was f rozen over.  So my f ather and som e other people decided that the 

Ru s s
ians haddone allthebad things they we re supposed to do, arrested people, took 
ever ything
 
--
 
ever ything they could find of value andtheyf eltthey could just slip back quietly 
and just rejoin thef am ilies.  And unf ortunately the Russianshad sealed the 
border at the tim e 
andthey caughtthem all.  Andm y f ather was putontrial and they said he was a spy. T hey 

gave him  20 years hard labor and sent him  off toSiberia. And so we losthim.  So just the 

three of  us.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Did he comm unicateatall,
 
writ e, was heableto write?
 
Halina Peabody:  For the f irst year, no. Af terthef irst year we got som e comm unication 
and we knew he was in Siberia.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So atf irst your town is
 
--
 
becom es occupied but not by the Germ ans.
 
Halina Peabody:  No,by
 
the Russians. T here was an agreem ent between Russiaand 

4 
 
Germ any in 1939 to split Poland in two.  Halfwas
 
--
 
the northpart went to the Germansand 
theeastpart was Russia.  And also becausem y f ather was given the sentence andhe was a 
crim inal, quote,
 
unquote, we were supposed to be going to Russiaas well.  T hey were going to 
takeus to Siberia.  But for som e reason, Idon't know why, they did not take us. But they threw 

us out of ourhouse because it was too good to have a house,afam ily of  a criminal. So we 

were told to go to a little place calledT luste, just up the road. So we packedupand that's 

where we m oved.  And that's that picture of my m other
 
--
 
that's theonly picture of m y sister as 
a young child that we have, in T luste.  And that was
 
already there.
 
Suzy Snyder:  How lon g did you stay in T luste?
 

Halina Peabody:  Until the end of the Russian occupation.
 
Suzy Snyder: W hichwas 1941.
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes. And they
 
--
 
they tried
 
--
 
the Russians dropped everybody one 
class becausethey wanted tohave more tim e to educateus or reeducate us. So I went not to 

kindergarten but pre
-
kindergarten.  And luckily I knew how to read, so m y mother kept me 
going that way.  And I rem ember learning a little bit of Russian letters.  Not that I rem em ber 

m uch of that, but we did
 
--
 
they did try.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And doyou rem em ber anything about T lusteother thanm aybe school?
 
Halina Peabody:  Notm uch.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And how long were you there?
 

Halina Peabody:  Until the
 
--
 
suddenly the Russians disappeared
 
and we understood 
thatthe Germ ans were com ing.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So thenyou went back to
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  Then we went back to Zaleszc zyki and toour house and settled back 
in and waitedf orthe new occupiers. 
 
Suzy Snyder:  And thenew occupiers were not German.
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes,they were, the new ones were Germ an.
 
Suzy Snyder:  At one point, though, the town is occupied by Yugoslav, is that not 
c o rre c t ?
 
Halina Peabody:  I don't remember the Yugoslavs.  I rem em ber theGerm ans com ing 
down the roadonbicycles and, you know, and blackunif orm s and gold buttons. I don't 

r e m em be r
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder:  How did  you feel when you saw them ?
 
Halina Peabody:  Scared. I was ver y scaredbecause they came ina very loud wa y, 
you know, m otorcycles , a bigf at man in
 
thef rontona motorcycle.  And the rest of them  were 
all in blackunif orm s, shiny, you know.  Very scary.  Very scar y.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And how was your m other through all of this?  Did she continue to have a 
goodf acade?  Could youfeel herf ear?
 
Ha lin a  P e
abody:  My m other did herbest totake care of us. And Iknow she was 
having a ver y hard time with m y sister.  But we stucktogether.  Andthis was them an whowas 

a technicianform y f atherf inishedaf ew jobsandthat's how we wer e able to survi ve.
 
S u zy
 
Snyder:  So atone point your mother decides they can't
 
--
 
you can't rem ain 
anym ore in Zaleszczyk i and
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  No,no,no,no.  Sorry.  Sorry.
 
(Laughter)
 
Halina Peabody:  No,no. W hathappened was when the Germ anscam e, Germ ans 
cam e in, they gave us all new rules and regulations.
 

5 
 
Suzy Snyder:  T hat's right.
 
Halina Peabody:  Thekids had
 
--
 
Jewish kids had no schools. W ehad to put yellow 
stars onthe housesand on
 
--
 
on our arm s.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Because they're occupying yo u, they're occupying the town.  And you 
also mention in one of your oral histories thatAktionsbegin. 
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes,that'sexactly what I was going to say.  Every Jew had to be 
workin g f or them ,nomatter whether there was a (inaudible), they used to makethem  clean 
the 
sidewalks.  Andm y m other, because they had a list of everybody and what everybody could 

do andthey knew m y m other was a great knitter sothey made herbe the chief  knitterfor the 

Germ anm ayor of  thetown.  And she knittedfor his children. T hat was
 
her job. And of course 
the two of us. And then they started, you know, by
 
--
 
well, ever ybody had to workf or them , 
andthey had various jobs to do. T hey created a comm itteeof  Jewish leaders there to be able 

to demand groups and whatever they needed.  T hey didn't want to go around lookingf or 

people. So they had thesefew people that were in charge of  giving them  whatever they 

needed.  And they would take groups of young peopleto work out in thefarms and out in 

th e
 
--
 
wherever they needed them  to do 
s ome  wo rk .
 
Suzy Snyder:  But youdon'tactually use theword " ghetto,"  but essentially it was a 
ghetto.
 
Halina Peabody:  No,no,not in Zaleszczyki.
 
Suzy Snyder:  But itfunction it is sam e way but it was open.
 
Halina Peabody:  No, I'm  sorry. W eshould have discussedthis before.
 
(Laughter)
 
No, no, we should have discussed this before.  No, it was not a ghetto. W e were all 
spreadout in the town.  They
 
--
 
a f ew
 
--
 
a couple of times they tooka group outand brought 
them  back. W eaccepted thatthat was th
e  
--
 
the system .
 
Suzy Snyder:  So people were leaving to go do slave laboror labor?
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, they were slaves m ore or less.T hey saidthey demanded200 
people or100 peopleor 50 people and they had to be in them orning and they took them  o
ut  
on a joband then they brought them  back. And then the next thing they wanted a very big 

group of  about
 
--
 
it was about600 pluspeople becausethey wantedto bind treesf orthe winter 
because winter was ve ry, ver y severe in Zaleszc zyki.  And sopeople
 
went.  A lot of people 
even went voluntarily.  Ever ybody wantedtohelp and, you know, tobe cooperative.  And they 

walked them  up the road, as usual,andtowards theaf ternoon nobody was com ing back and 

ever ybody got ver y, very scared andnot knowin g what was happening.  And nobody cam e 

back until late in the evening, onem an cam eback andhehad beenshot in the arm .  Andhe 

told us what happened.  W hen they got to the woods where thetrees were to bebound they 

found there was an open grave there with planks over it and they we re told to undressand lay 

down over the planksand they were shot. As they were shot they dropped into the grave.  

And thism an was oneof the last ones to be shot.T hey m issed hisheart,and that's why he 

wa s
 
--
 
and he was on top. So whenthe Germ ans lef t, not caring even if  they covered them  
ver y m uch, whentheGerm ans left he managed to scram ble out ofthe grave and cam eand 

told us what
 
--
 
what wa s happening.  And then we understood thenthat we were in grave 
danger and we also knew there was nothing for us to do because we had nowhere to run, 

nowhere to go.
 
Suzy Snyder:  You had said that you would
 
--
 
thatpeople would watch people leave 
ever y day and hope that they cam e back.  You must have
 
--
 
people m ust have known that 

6 
 
th
ere was som e kind of Aktions going onalready bef ore thisbig one, yes?
 
Halina Peabody:  Not to m y knowledge.
 
Suzy Snyder:  But they hadfear, right?
 
Halina Peabody:  I
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder:  T hef ear of theunknown.
 
Halina Peabody:  I was a child.  I can'ttell
 
you what everybody thought.
 
Suzy Snyder:  No, no,but
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  Butwhat I
 
--
 
what I was saying is that this is what happenedand then 
this was thebig one.At thispoint everybody tried to lookfor a hiding place.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.
 
Ha lin a  P
eabody:  And,you know, we all knew thatthis would happen again.  And so the 
next tim e cam ea demandfor people to go to work in Germ any.  Nobody believed them  
anym ore. Everybody s cattered around and hid. T hey m anaged tof ind thenum berof  people 

they needed. T hey loaded them on thetrain,andaf ter that, you see, there were notm any 

Jews lef t in that town.  A small town.  So they decided to throw us allout,the rest of us, the 

rest of the Jews.  They threw us out again to the littletown of T luste. That's where it eventually 

becam e a ghetto.
 
Suzy Snyder:  I skipped a big chunk.  Sorry.
 
Halina Peabody:  But at that tim e it was still open. T hey just tolduswhich area to goto. 
W ejust settling in.  And we discovered that not only our little groupof
 
--
 
who rem ained in our 
little town was there but also sm all groupsf rom  the surrounding counties.  And so we were all 

together there.  And we
 
--
 
thef irst thingm y m other said tom e,everybody was looking for 
hiding places.  And she said it'snot going to work because they're going to m ove us again.  

T hat was herunderstanding.  And she started trying to get the children, my sister andI, out to 

Rom ania. It was only to cross the river, but itwasn't easy.  And nothing worked.  So the end 

when thedem and came againfor people to work in Germ any, everybody hid intheirplaces, 

wherever they could f ind. But my m other, because we had been there before, so we knew a 

few f arm ers there. So m y m other decided toputm e with onefarmer and I was up in the loft, 

and
 
she wentand paid anotherfarmer to keep her throughtheday. And we split up that way.  
Andall day long
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder:  And she had your sister?
 
Halina Peabody:  Oh,yes, she was with m y s ister.  She tookher. So I all day was 
thinking that she was c
aught.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.
 
Halina Peabody:  Andm y
 
--
 
the lady who had m e kept com ing backsaying that she had 
seenthis oneand this one, they would collect them  andput them in the square until they had 

the right number. And
 
--
 
but there were people I knew in the square.  SoI knew a lot of people 
were caught.  And towards the endof  theevening f inally she did com ebackand topick me up.  

And she said to me that she was ina terrible statebecause shethought I was caught. Andso 

she said to me, we are never going to split up again. W hatever happens, the three of us will 

go together. And that was her decision, andof  course Iagreed. And af ter that
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder:  At some point she tries to secure papers.
 
Halina Peabody:  Thatwas the thing. W esaid before thenext time it happens, she and 
herf riends decided because we were allf emales they couldn't check, they decided totry and 

get false identities.  So they went toa Catholic priest.  You know, Poland is99.999
 
Catholic so 
it had tobea Catholic priest and bought
 
--
 
purchased some papers with
 
--
 
f or the three ofus.  

7 
 
T he y
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder:  T his is
 
--
 
the war is going on, it's ver y hard times. W hat did she purchase 
the false papers with?
 
Halina Peabody:  Herfriends helped her.  You know, we had goodfriends.  People were 
helping each other.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.
 
Halina Peabody:  They wanted us totry.  People understood there was not muchhope.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.
 
Halina Peabody:  Andso we got good names.  Because m y sister didn't know anythin
g,  
she was a baby.  So she sat me down and told m e m y new nam e,m y new grandparents, 
birthplace, whatever I neededto know.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So youm emorized a whole new identity.
 
Halina Peabody:  I had to m em orize that.  And ourf riends kindly took us to
 
--
 
it was not 
closed yet, so I rem ember that we went to the train and they
 
--
 
they told me we were going to a 
place called Jaroslaw, which was another town.  It was half way to Krakow, I don't know why, 

butanyhow that's where we were supposed to be going.  An
d  t he
 
--
 
as I said, there were no 
m ore Jews there officially.  T hey helpedus get on the train and we said good
-
bye to them.  
Andas I said,all we had left was a suitcaseof  clothing and littlem oney they collectedf orus.  

And we started traveling.
 
W e  we
re supposed tobe traveling two days and two nights.  You know, those trains 
were not today's trains.  They remember old
-
fashioned, very old and not nice. But we 
we r e
 
--
 
we were doing our best to run. W e knew we were goin g to have to be
 
--
 
be chased 
so m e
where. I was very scared, you know, the train would stop, m y m other would go down and 
I would be waiting.  So it was a little scary.
 
As we were travelin g, a young m an attachedhim self tous and started chatting with m y 
m other,being very nice and asking about the children. My m other was ver y nice tohim and 

they were chatting away.  But thenhe startedasking m oreprobing questions.  Andm y m other 

f inally told me look
 
--
 
he pushed me so hard Icould not
 
--
 
I couldn't do anything.  I told him. I 
actually 
told him  that we were Jewish.  Andhe said well, in that case, Iam going to Jaroslaw 
as well.  I will ha ve to take you with m e.  Andwith we get to Jaroslaw I'm  going to give you 

b a c k .  I  will
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder:  Hand you in.
 
Halina Peabody:  To the Gestapo.
  
And som y m otherunderstood that. She said
 
--
 
s he  
toldm eeverything.  She said sheunderstoodthatthat's what's going to happen. W e were 

going to travel with him  and when we get to Jaroslaw we were going to be handedover to the 

Gestapo.
 
Suzy Snyder:
  
Do you think thathe knew you were Jews bef ore
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  He was suspicious, you know.  Mother and two children.  He was 
suspicious.T hat's how he started, you know, pushing.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Prying.
 
Halina Peabody:  Yeah.  And so that's how we traveled. And m y mother, never giving 
up, started thinking wh at could we do. W hatcouldbe done? W ell,we couldn't run. T here was 

nowhere to go. W e knew that we had not many choices, if any.  Sof inally, she cam etoa 

decision.  She explained thattom e
 
too very caref ully.  She said that shem adea deal with him . 
She said that she wasgiving him  ticketsf or the luggage andany m oney she hadand even 

prom ised the coatsonour backs if  he would do one thingf or her. W hen we get to the Gestapo 

8 
 
to have us shot,all three of us, atonce, because she understood that the
 
--
 
the less suff ering 
for all of us if  we were going to betaken away.  She knew the children would be killed,no 
m atter what.  Shedidnot want to survive by herself  because they m ight sent her toa labor 

cam p but she justdidnot want to do withoutthe children. So that'swhat she askedhim todo.  

Andapparently he said yes.  And that's how we traveled the rest of the way.  She kept thinking 

butnothing else cameto m indand we were ki nd of
 
ina stupor alm ost. W e were traveling f our 
days andfournights on the train, it was really horrible and I was full of  lice,our head and 

clothesand everything.  Andf inally we get toJaroslaw and when we get there and on the 

platf orm  we start going down the platform .  And I suddenly woke upandI said oh, m y God.  I'm 

going to die. And I started pulling at m y mother.  Mom, Mom , I don't want to die.  I told Mother, 

as we were walking, s he said to him well, yo u know, maybe you can lether go because she'
s 
blond and green
-
eyedandm aybe she'll survive.  AndI saidno, I'mnot going without you.  So 
we continue walking towards the Gestapo. And then she says to him ,do you have any 

children of your own?  And he said yes.  So she said look, I gave you everything I had. Keep 

it. W hy don't you just let us goand try our luck?  I was walking andhe's walking with us. And 

she said to him, and she added this, "W hy do you want uson yourconscience."  I've give n you 

ever ything I have. W hy don't you just let us go, try.  And som ething attached him and he said 

to her you don't have a chance. Butheturned aroundand lef t us.And so there we were, the 

threeof  us, homelessand nothing becausem y m other holding thebaby and me by the hand 

and standing in them iddle of  this town on the main road.  She started looking around.
 
Suzy Snyder:  He tookever ything, butnot your false docum ents.
 
Halina Peabody:  Pardon?W ell, no, the docum ents, I think shehadsom ewhere in her 
pocket.  No, what would he do with the docum en
ts.  No. 
 
Suzy Snyder: W hich was
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  Never askedabout that one.  And m y mother saw a little cafe.  She 
walked in there and askedfor a littlem ilkfor the baby.  And thebig baby by then, and then she 

startedasking around, if  there were any places that took lodgers in. It was ver y im portantfor 

us tobe inside, because the Germ ans were walking around, you know, with guns up and it 

was ver y easy to get shot or taken inor whatever.  Shedidn't
 
--
 
she didn't know about the 
papers.  Idon't
 
know to thisday if they were real or not. I gave them  to them useum, but I 
don't know if they were good ornot. T here were no com puters inthose days, so they couldn't 

ju st  ch e ck.
 
At any rate, we didn't want them  exam ined, if possible.  Andthe one man
 
got up and 
said yes, I know a was her lady that takes people inand lodgers.  He said I'll walk you over to 

them . So thethree of us went with him ,nottoofarf rom there,andsaw the little house. There 

were three separate apartments, if  you
 
--
 
Ha lin a  P
eabody:  Inthat house. W e were the m iddleone. T here was this sweet lady, 
she saw the mother and three kidsand she said Okay I'll take you. But the sons,they had 

three strapping sons, they said no, no, no,mom don't take them .  I'm  not surprised they
 
said 
that.  She said oh, no,this is am otherandtwo children.  Ihave to take.  And she D. shetook 

her in. W e got abed. That's all we needed. My m other explained to her that we hadno 

m oney but thenext day she would go to work and whatever she earned she wouldbring for us 

andto keep us. And she did that. She took care
 
--
 
sheused to goto hom es and helpand 
change the jobs af ew tim es. Me,as aPolish child, I could go to schoolf or two hours aday.  

Now, I hadnobackground in religion.  My own, Ihardly knew.  I only knew I was Jewish.  And I 

was going to a Hebrew schoolonSunday when the tim e cam e andthey taught mehow tosign 

9 
 
m y name in Hebrew.  I don't know exactly why, but I still know how to sign m y nam e in 
Hebrew.  Asf ar as religion,
 
you know, I just knew I was Jewish, that's it.  So Ihad no 
background in religion per se. And then Catholic religion, I knew even less.  All I was told I 

have to crossm yself  with m y right hand as you go in andas I comeout.T hat's all I knew.  But 

th
e good thing was that one of the hours of the two hours in schoolwas a
 
--
 
one was priest, 
there was apriest teaching religion and theother was m ore general. Andthe Catholic religi on 

was being taught with a catechism and therewas a little booklet with
 
questionsand answers.  
So I grabbed atthat and I
 
--
 
of  courseI couldread, so I
 
--
 
you know, I quickly read andthat 
helpedm ea great deal.  The priest was very nice, very s weet.  Andof  course, they didn't 

k n o w.   B u t  s t ill,  I d id  very we ll wit h  h im a
nd the teacherand because I could read, I was a good 
pupil, so that wasf ine.  I alsohelpedby worki ng for a neighbor.  My m other thought it was 

good f or us to be busy and to be working.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Letm eask you a question,though, about the Catholic
is m .   Did  yo u
 
--
 
did 
you em brace itas something new and knowledgeable that you were learning and
 
--
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, I knew that Ihad topretend to be a Catholic.
 
Suzy Snyder:  T hat's what I was wondering.  W as itm ostly pretending or
 
--
 
Ha lin a  P ea
body:  It was pretending, but I must say I like Catholic religion andm y mother 
realized that.  At one point she quietly tookme over and said we allpray to the sam e god but 

through different religions and you're Jewish. So thatm adem e quite completely
 
--
 
you know, I 
knew what I was doing and I
 
--
 
as I said, I like the Catholic religion but I knew it wasn't m ine, so 
thatdidn't give m e any trouble.
 
Suzy Snyder:  I just want to aska question about youand your
 
--
 
yo ur relationship with 
your m other atthis point. Are you
 
--
 
is it a typical mother/daughterrelationship?  Did yougi ve 
her adiff icult tim e becausethat's just what itwas like or did you
 
--
 
were you aware that you 
needed to behave, do ever ything she said?
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, I did anywa y. 
 
I had aver y good relationshipwith m y m other. 
My m other was so nice and so fair always, even inher punishm ent.And we knew we 

we r e
 
--
 
we were savin g our lives.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.
 
Halina Peabody:  Thatwas always in our m inds as well.  And I was
 
--
 w
e were partners.  
T here was nobody else who knew who we were.  My sister didn't know.  Obviously she was 

too young.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.  You said she was
 
--
 
yo u were partners.  Did you m iss having her 
as am otheror did youhave her both asa mother and a
 
partner?
 
Halina Peabody:  No, she was still m y m otherbutalso partner.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And you helped her.
 
Halina Peabody:  I was her support.  It was the two of  us who knew who we were.  So 
she usedto sometimes chat with me andtalk tom eabouther youth
 
and what it was like when 
she wasf am ous swim m er when she was very young and it was a very nice relationship.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And during theday she
 
--
 
she was at
 
--
 
she worked.
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes,she worked. AndI went to school and I
 
--
 
the wom an who 
had
 
--
 
the lady thathad
 
--
 
was ver y nice to me but she taughtm ea lot of things. I was helping 
around the house.  She made surethat I
 
--
 
see, she wanted to save m y soul,I understand and 
appreciate that.  So she sent mefor classes. I went to communion. There's a picture of me in 

comm union. And thatwas all ri ght.  Everythi ng was
 
--
 
e ver ything was quite acceptable.  Iwas 
ju st  sca re d.
 

10
 
 
Suzy Snyder:  You knew you neededtodo it,right?
 
Halina Peabody:  Yeah.  As I said, there was nothing
 
--
 
I did not 
feel bad about doing 
any of  it. W e were hungry. W e kidsused to go scramble,try to steal some f oodf rom the 

farm ers,for instance,when they came in, they would have to check in a certainamount of  

product that they had to bring in.  Once it was found they brought in the right am ount, we kids 

usedto jum p over theback of the trucksandtractors with the cartsand we used to just grab 

whatever we could to
 
--
 
we had mainly barley.  That's what I rem ember, which I did not like 
even before the war.
 
( Laughter ) 
 
Suzy Snyder:  Did your
 
--
 
did your m om  workfor the Germansthen?
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, at f irst she worked allover the place. She also
 
--
 
she was very 
worr ied about security and one of the things she worried ver y m uchabout was m y sister's hair 

because she
 
--
 
m y sister hasdark hair, curly hair.  Shehasa little Af ro.
 
(Laughter)
 
And this is terriblebecausefor the
 
--
 
f or Poland because the Polishgirls then, there 
were not thatm any otherforeigners, there were just Polish girls, straight blondhair. And, you 

know
 
--
 
and Ihadblond hair at least, wavy but they braidedm ine, but hers was impossible. 
Andeven today when she goesto thehairdresser she comes in with beautif ul hair and then 

two drops of  waterf alland then she goes
 
--
 
( Lau
gh t e r ) 
 
So she always had this problem . And she just shaved itoff .
 
Suzy Snyder: W hy was it a problem ,explain wh y dark curly hair
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  Because she was af raidof being recognized as Jewish.  Of course, 
Jewish gi rls had curly hair.
 
S u zy S n
yder:  So she looked Jewish and youlooked more
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  Shedoesn't really look Jewish but the hair was a gi veawa y.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So did she
 
--
 
she shavedher hair off.
 
Halina Peabody:  Notm e, her.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Your m other shaved her hairoff
. 
Halina Peabody:  Yes,com pletely.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Did it work?
 

Halina Peabody: W ell, it m ust have worked. She
 
--
 
she said it was because if you 
shave it off it com esback thicker. So that was her excuse. She also tried to offerourselves as 

Poles to go
 
to work in Germ any because, you know, shef eltthat the Polishpeople recognized 
Jews m uch easier than the Germansbut they didn't takeus becausem y sister was too young.  

So she tried all kinds of stuff in order to be more secure.  And what
 
--
 
what happened was that 
when
 
--
 
by the time she applied for the job wi th the Germ ans was because shef elt that if  she 
hadanID card in case they could catch up wi th usand askfor papers that this m ight help.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.
 
Halina Peabody:  And it actually did.  Because what happened was at onepoint they 
cam e tothe houseand they started scream ing " get out," " get out,"  guns drawn in them iddle of  

thenight.  Everybody got up andm y m other showed the papers, she showed the ID card and 

they say all right, you stay.  Soonly Jews stayed andthe others were taken into the station to 

be checked out. W hatthey wanted to know about the Poles, thatthey workedf or them .  Ifthey 

were busy working f orthe Germans,they wer ef ine.  So they sent them back the next day.
  
B u t 
we didn't have to go to the station. And thatwas one of those things that was just lucky that 

11
 
 
she did that. 
 
W ehad, during this time, one letterf rom  thepeople we lef t behind, and they gave us 
som e very good news and that was that m yfatherhad sent a letterthrough the Red Cross that 
he was with his sister in Palestine, now Israel.  But at that tim e it was all under the British. It 

was under the Britishm andate. So we understood that he was f ree and he was out of Russia.  

W e could not do anythi
ng because during theGerm an occupationobviousl y we couldn't 
contact anybody outside, but we had that inform ation so we hoped if anything things get a little 

bit som ehow worked out, thatmaybe som etim e in thef uturethe war will be over and we might 

be able to get back tohim ,but we knew he was safe
 
Suzy Snyder:  So getting back to the wom anyou were hiding with, just brief ly, you said 
she had sonsand were her sonsever suspicious? Did they ever qu estion?
 
Halina Peabody:  They could have been.  Idon't know.  Frankly, I don't know.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Just let it go.
 
Halina Peabody:  They never checked. They never asked.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So I just want to jum pahead alittle to when you were
 
--
 
I m ean, it'snot 
really liberation but suddenly the war endsbut in a tragic way.
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, yes sort of . Not quite.  BecauseI'm here. W ell, we did not know 
what was going on in the front.W ehad no papers,no radios. If  you had a radio, that was a 

death penalty.  So nobody hadthem .W e didn't know what was goi ng on. And som y m other 

kept working andas I said, we didn't know what was going on.  Butonem orning, usually the 

horse and cart would go at4:00 inthe morning and this time, thatmorning, there was nothing.  

It was just loud sirenson the streets. My m other was on the bed wit h m y sister.  I was 

standing by the window by the bed. She was talk to go me and said maybe should I go to 

work or should Inot? And suddenly there was a trem endous blackand a bang and theone 

andonly bom b that fell on that town fell on that house and split the top.  And I started cryin g, 

m y hand,m y hand.  Andm y m other grabbed m y sister and me by the hand and we walked 

out. My hand was bleeding badly and she
 
--
 
there was nobody to
 
--
 
to pick m e up either, so 
we  j u s t wa
lked. W e walked to the hospital. And that
 
--
 
then we learned thatthe Russians 
were com ing the second tim e. And they patchedm e up, they scared m y mother. They said 

there were no
 
--
 
therewas no penicillin so I had a very bi g open woundonm y hand and 
t h e y 
said they m ight have to cut the handoff . T hey didn't. Thenuns were wonderfulnurses,and 

they saved m y hand. In the meantime,m y mother started knitting again a little bit to get som e 

m oney to send requests for my mother.  Everybody was looking f
or people.  And she f inally 
started writing those announcem entsand luckily we f oundm y father.  It took a while.
 
Suzy Snyder:  T he war  is
 
--
 
your
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  TheRussians are com ing.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.  So there's still
 
--
 
the war is still somewhat going on indiff erent 
parts of Europe,f or sure.
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, m y m other said to me, you know, they're not leaving. We 
understood.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So you
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  They were not killing the Jews.
 
Suzy Snyder:  T
h at ' s  r i gh t .
 
Halina Peabody:  And in som e way they m ade som e kind of a sem ioff icial agreement 
thatthey ledthe Jews out. Sem i official, pay the guards on thef ront, but they did allow us out 

eventually.
 

12
 
 
Suzy Snyder:  But your m other wasn't still open about thef act that you were Jewish, 
you didn't talk
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  No,we couldn't because whenI was in the hospital I said now I can 
say who I am . And she said no, there was aPogrom  and killed thefew Jew that is came out of 
hiding.
 
Suzy Snyder:  T here was still anti
-
S em it ism .
 
Halina Peabody: W e had to keep that up until we lef t, got with a Jewish agency group, 
we had to keep thatup, yes.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So I'm sorry to
 
--
 
Halina Peabody:  No, that's all right. That'sall right.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So youwere in contact with yo ur dad, you were still living in Poland.
 
S T UDE NT :  Righ t. My fa the r
 
--
 
it took a while.  My m other alsohad
 
--
 
was diagnosed 
with breast cancer, so she hadtohave the operation.
 
Suzy Snyder: W heredid she have it? W here did she
 
have the operation?
 
Halina Peabody:  There, in Jaroslaw.
 
Suzy Snyder: W e're still?  Jaroslaw.
 
Halina Peabody:  Oh,yeah, we were in Jaroslav.  In the meantime,m y f atherdidnot 
want to com ehim self ,he was af raidof beingtaken by the Russiansagain so 
he sent his 

cousinandhe cam e to get us. W henm y m other went back tothe place we were li ving in the 

m iddle, she discover that had the lady died. It was the sam ebond.W ecame through the 

kitchenand the roof had com edown and apparently she was undern
eath.  So she died, 

unf ortunately.  Yes.  And there was nothing in that
 
--
 
that littleplace that we could salvage so 
theneighbornext door took us in.  So whenm y cousin cam e, he put us in touch with the 

Jewish agency andf inally we had to move toanother place, closer to Krakow and we were  

f inally transported out. W em ade it toBerlin.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And when did you reunite with your f ather?
 
Halina Peabody:  Pardon?
 
Suzy Snyder: W hen did you reunite with your father? W hendid you and your father
 
--
 
Ha
lina Peabody: W ell, he came twice hem issed us.  You know, we  were on the road 
som ewhere. Everybody was m oving around.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Right.  Of course.
 
Halina Peabody:  Sof inally he caughtup with us, and we were in Munichand we 
stayed.  And there was a in Italy there was aDP camp calledT rani,and we said there.  He 

was in a Polishunit created with Stalin's agreem ent that they let them  out tof ight becausethey 

were worried about having m ore boots on the ground. Sothey letout the whole unit and th
e 

general who was also a prisoner there who created this unit was ver y kind and he wouldnot 

take just them en.  Hesaid he's going to takefam iliesas well.  Andthat's how m y auntand 

uncleand cousin cam e out and of course m yfather. And they were serving in the British 

Arm y.  They were partof the BritishArm y.  And m yf ather was actually stationed in Egypt.  But 

h is  s is t e r wa s  in  T e l A viv.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And didyou
 
--
 
eventually you m oved to the United Kingdom .
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, becausehe was partof  the BritishArm y, we had the right to go 
to England. So we
 
--
 
we didn't have to wait for Visa.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And what year was that,do you remember?
 
Halina Peabody:  1940
-
som ething, I think. I can't rem em ber exactly.  I can look it up.
 
S u zy 
Snyder:  And you reestablished a lif e in the United Kingdom.
 

13
 
 
ST UDENT : That's what we had todo. W e were
 
--
 
started ina new language and 
ever ything new, andeventually
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder:  How did  you like England?
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, I'm  not sure I
 
--
 
th
ey were goodtous, you know. W e were not in 
danger of dying, but I didn't know the language and it was diff icult.  And my oneoutlet that I 
foundfor m yself  was table tennisbecause Iplayed table tennis was everywhere and I liked 

tennisbut there were nofacilitiesfor that, so Iplayed a lot of table tennis.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So you talk about it as if  it'sa hobby, but really you we re this am azing 
tabletennis person. You played
 
--
 
you hadalot of  success with it. You traveled around the 
wo rld  wit h  it .
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, what happened was when
 
--
 
when we got toour housethere 
was a Maccabiah Club, this was a Jewish club and I spent allm y tim e, all my evenings there.  

And whenIsrael was created they also started having the Jewish Olym pic gam es call
ed  
Maccabiah Gam es.  And Ieventually they sent two guys and me torepresent England and 

Israel.  Andthat was when I traveled to Israelfor thef irst tim e. And that was wonderf ul. I 

becam eback.  Ididn't want to com ebackbut I didbecause m y m other was not very well.  So I 

cam e back. T hat was1953.  Andm y m otherpassed away 1956,unfortunately.  So I went 

again tothe next Maccabiah was 1956, and1957, excusem e.
 
Suzy Snyder:  So your m om  was young, shewas.
 
Halina Peabody:  48.
 
Suzy Snyder:  In her 
40 s .
 
Halina Peabody:  Very young.
 
Suzy Snyder: W herewas your sister at thispoint, living in England?
 

Halina Peabody:  She was in England. Shewas like
 
--
 
she was very young, 17
 
1 /2 .  I 
worr ied abouther a lot.  And in theend I brought her over toIsraelfor years of  service, it's 

called (inaudible).  She came andall the mascara cam edown.  Shecame because they make 

you work, half a day yo u work and half  theday you
 
--
 
you learn Hebrew.  She m et herfuture 
husbandthere and he is English so they went back to London. So that's where she resides.  

She's in London.
 
Suzy Snyder:  But youlived in Israelf or some tim e.
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes.
 
Suzy Snyder:  How m any years did you live in  Israel.
 
Halina Peabody:  11.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And you said som ething aboutliving in Israel that I thought was 
interesting.  It gave you back your Jewishness.
 
Halina Peabody:  Absolutely.  Gave m e backm y soul. W hat happened was you see 
when I started working in Israel,I had to have a job in English.  So we got
 
--
 
I got a joba
t  th e  
Am erican Em bassy in T el Avi v, which was ve ry glam orous. I liked that very much. And Im et 

m y husband.  She was another survi vor f romBulgaria.  So the two of us were working f or 

Am ericans, andm y husband was sentover to the United States coast to coast.  He was with 

US inf ormation agency.  And therefore, he
 
wanted 
--
 
they wanted him  to know aboutAmerica.  
He was presenting America's youth to the Vietnam W ar andhe needed to know m ore about 

the States. Sohefell in love with the UnitedStates, so
 
he said why don't we go for a yearto 
the UnitedStates. W e had
 
--
 
m y son was alreadyf ive years old by the tim e we got
 
--
 
six s o we 
ended up here. He got a job here, and that's
 
--
 
was in 1968.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And you've beenhereever since.  I've beenhere ever since.  When I 

14
 
 
retired, I said I must do some volunteer work.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.
 
Suzy Snyder: W hatdid you dof or a living here?
 
Halina Peabody:  I worked for
 
--
 
for a lot of real estate off ices.  Not construction. Im ean 
in the
 
o f f i ce .
 
Suzy Snyder:  And you retired in, I'm sorry, I interruptedbut you decided youneeded to 
volunteer.
 
Halina Peabody: W hen I retired I was looking f or something to do,andIfound the 
Holocaust Museum of course andIm issed thef act that when I got
 
to Israel,how wonderful it 
was becausethat was m y kind of  im portant date in m y life.  I don't know how it is but Ithink 

being Jewish, going to Israel was som ething thata lotof peoplefeel, and I felt imm ediately at 

home.  And I felt that I was som ebo
dy.  Because being a refugee isnofun. And inEngland, 

even though they legally gave m e all the rights, they didn't
 
--
 
they didn't lovem e like, you 
know, in Israel. In Israel everybody's open, ever ybody wanted to show me, to teachm e, to do 

things f or 
m e. And I just really and trulyf elt a new personthere.  And I hope I'm still that 

thoughI lef t Israel. But I do go back often.  Andm y trek is usually I go f rom here toT elAvi v 

and then London and then back hom e.
 
Suzy Snyder: W hich you're doing soon, yes?  In June, I think?
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes,in June.
 
Suzy Snyder:  I wanted to take afew questions.  And we have one right here inf ront, by 
wa y of  the web. 
 
>> T hank you very m uch.  W e have a coupleof  questionsf rom  students, we have a 
couple of  classroom s in studentsf rom  Iowa who are watching today online.  So lotsof  great 

questions. Can youhear m e?
 
Suzy Snyder:  She just asked me to repeat it. She can't hear it. Speak up a little. 
 
>> So we' ve got a couple of classroom s inIowa watching to
day.
 
Suzy Snyder:  People in Iowa are watching on the web.
 
Halina Peabody:  Oh, I see. 
 
>> T hey have lotsof  great questions.  I'm  justgoing to gi ve you a couple quick andeasy 
ones, I think. Thef irst one is, do you remember what your name was on your f alse papers, 

and were you related to your sister andm other in thef ake identity documents as well?
 
Suzy Snyder:  Yes, I think do you rem emberwhat was your false nam e?
 
Halina Peabody:  My f irst
 
--
 
Suzy Snyder:  Your f alse nam e.
 
Halina Peabody:  Oh,Alina 
La t i n s k a.
 
Suzy Snyder:  And you really didn't have to change thef irst name.
 
Halina Peabody:  No, I didn'tand Idon't know wh y they dropped theH.
 
(Laughter)
 
Suzy Snyder:  T he answer is yes. 
 

>> And then we haveanother questionabout do you rem em ber seeing any kind of 
Germ an propagandaas a young child underoccupation, posters oranything like that?
 
Suzy Snyder:  Do you rem em ber seeing any Germ an propaganda,postersas a young 
child, the swastikas and posters, radio broadcasts?
 
Halina Peabody:  I don't recall that. W e didn't have a radio.  No radio was allowed.  But 
I had to have the yellow star, so that was
 
--
 
that was the only thing that I remember. Yeah.  By 
the tim e we got to Jaroslaw there were no
 
--
 
there were no Jews.  They hadus all in slave

m y 
sister said look at me. Do I have horns?  Do I have a tail? 
 
Suzy Snyder:  She was really indoctrinated.
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes,exactly.  So, you know, we had to explain to her.
 
Suzy Snyder:  Yes, go ahead. 
 
Audience Mem ber:  Do you
 
ever travel back to Poland? 
 
Suzy Snyder:  Do you ever travel back to Poland?
 
Halina Peabody:  I have beenaboutfour tim es, but with good reasons.  
Comm em oration of 50th anniversary of W arsaw Ghettouprising and then to see if m y house 

was still up andm y house would have been

it's now Ukraine, that part of Poland.  And when 
they foundm y m other's other Jewish athletes details and they hada ver y nice exhibit in 

Krakow, so m y sister and I went.  And we also saw thenew m useum  thatthey have.
 
S u zy S n yd e
r:   I n W arsa w?
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes,for the Jews.  Sothatwas anotherone.  And I don't
 
--
 
and I went 
onceto see theAuschwit z with a groupf romhere. But I don'tnormally go to Poland because I 

don'tfeel comf ortable and there have been problem s becau
s e a  lot of  pe o p le a re  st ill liv in g  in  

houses thatbelong to the Jews and they've beentheref or70 yearsandthey
 
--
 
they don't want 
to give it back.  I didn't because I didn't have any, butthat was thefeeling that, you know, you 

alwa ys worried.  I was warned.  I was warned to be very caref ul.  So I don't gofor pleasure.  I 

would like to, but I

I'm  no t comfo rta b le . 
 
Suzy Snyder:  Yes. 
 

Audience Mem ber:  So if you m et aGermanwho had killedpeopleduring the war, like 

16
 
 
he was like sorry he did it andhe came up toyou right now, would you be angry or have hard 
feelings toward him?
 
Suzy Snyder:  If  youmet aGerman who was
 
--
 
who had murdered people during the 
war, would you beangry?
 
Halina Peabody:  First of  all, I can't meet a Germ an through the war,
 
hem ust be very, 
ver y old. 
 
(Laughter)
 
I have met young Germ ans and we had a wonderful Germ an am bassador here. T hey 
accept and adm it that it was
 
--
 
what they didwas terrible.  They I had Kate their children and, 
you know, they can't give us back the liv
es
 
--
 
the people they killed. But hatred is not very 
usef ulbecause if you hate, youonly hurt yourself.  Idonot hate them .  I
 
--
 
I would like to 
actually bef riends with them  andteach them andtell them m y story.  And they are very, ve ry 

good.  Asf ar
 
as I know Mrs.
 
Merkel was
 
--
 
took all these refugees because she said they didn't 
take Jews during the war, so that's why she was, you know, trying to help refugees. SoI don't 

feel Ihate the Germans.  The Germ an language m akes mefeelf unny, but a lot 
of Jews sp ea k 

Germ an, too.  So no. No, I don'tfeelbad about them . 
 
Suzy Snyder:  Yes.
 
Audience Mem ber:  Did you ever see theperson that gave you thechance to make iton 
your own whenever yo u got off the train again?
 
Suzy Snyder:  Did you ever see the Polish man that let you becomefree?
 
Halina Peabody:  No, I haven't. I wish I could.  Hem ust be very oldnow, but I would 
have liked to
 
--
 
I would have liked to thankhim  actually, yes. 
 
Suzy Snyder:  Yes.
 
Audience Mem ber: W ho did you keep as your 
c lo s e s t  a llie s ?
 
Suzy Snyder: W ho did you keep as your closest allies? 
 
Halina Peabody:  During the war?  My m other.  I couldn't
 
--
 
I couldn't have allies. I 
m ean, I hadf riends.
 
Suzy Snyder:  You wer e each other's allies.
 
Halina Peabody:  Yes. Because, you know, you hadtobe so very c aref ul, you know.  
So I was mainly with my m other. It was very hard when we cam eout and I became a child 

again. 
 

Suzy Snyder: W e have time forone more. Right here. 
 
Audience Mem ber: W ould you ever think ofgoing back to likeGerm any? Like ever go 
to Germ any and see what they did? 
 
Suzy Snyder: W ould you ever visit Germ any? 
 
Halina Peabody:  Oh,yes.  I have no reasonnot to visit Germ any.  I don't particularly 
want to. ButI mean if  there was a reason, I would go. 
Yeah. 
 
Suzy Snyder:  Jude,do you have any m ore? So it'sour tradition in
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
to  l e t 
you have the last word, so I'm  turning it over to you.
 
Halina Peabody: W ell, I would like to just say that there's a Hebrew saying, "tikkun 
olam ,"  which means repairing the world, and feel like that's what I would likeeverybody help to 

do thatbecause we all need to help each other and worry about thefutureand I'm old, so Ican 

only talk aboutthepast but thef uturebelongs to the young people. And it's
 
--
 t
here's alwa ys 
tim eand there's always need to repair the world.  Sothat was
 
--
 
that's m y
 
--
 
m y  wi s h. 
 
Suzy Snyder:  T hank you so much, Halina.
