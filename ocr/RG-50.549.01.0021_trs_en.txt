Q: I would like to start by 
asking you, again, your name

A: My name is Lily Masut(
ph) Mar gules.  I am a daught er of two pr of es sio nal 
people, Da vid Masur(ph) wa
s a pharmacist and Gutalip
 Carich Masu
r(ph) was a 
dentist.  I was born on Ap
ril 19, 1924, in a town ca
lled Vienna(ph).  Many times 
people called it Jerusalem of
 Lithuania, and I al
so had a younger 
sister, Rachel. 
We had a very happy and pa
mpered childhood.  Also, th
ere was a nanny who took 
car e of m e and my s ist er; and, als o, we had
, a very important me
m b er of our f a mily  
was a dog called Rex.  
 We we re really given the bes
t educ at ion t h at was pos sible,  
att ended privat e s c hool, we wer e give
n piano les son and danc ing les s on an d 
French lesson, and it 
was a very happy
 household full of la
ughter and goodwill and 
car i ng.  And, unf ort unat ely, t h e bubble burst,
 the pink bubble burst  on Sept em ber 1,  
1939, when the German 
army inv a ded Poland.
 
Q: May b e we c an st ay a litt le bi
t with your family 
bef ore we go on.  You said bot h of  
your parents were professionals.  Coul
d you say a little bi
t more about whic h 
pr ofess i on and giv e a litt le
 bit more of the sense of 
y o ur hous e, what did y ou do,  
your ________.
 
A: Well, as I mentioned befo
r e,  m y f ather  was a pharm a ci
st.  My father
 was from a 
very poor but religious fa
mily, and he wa s a self-m
ade man who really made 
himself what he wa s and wa s very we ll lo ok
ed upon by th
e m ember s of t he family .  
He was a pharmac ist and at
 t h is t i me he suff er ed al
r eady bec a us e he was J e wis h  

pharm a c ist,  bec a us e in 1933, when ev eryt hi
ng st art e d t o  br ew 
in  Na zi Ger m a n y , in 
Poland the anti- Semitism grew
 very rapidly.  At  this 
time, he was working in a 
government very big pharmacy.
  He was told that he 
c annot work  there any m or e ,  
that he has to have 
a different degree, he
 has to have a Master
 in Pharmacy.  So 
you went and you studied very
 hard and finally 
he had this degree
 in Master of 
Phar macy.   Ev en when a very anti- Sem it i
c prof es sor was givi
ng him a very harsh 
time, he went to
 the exam, answered all the diffic
ult questions, and when he was 
com i ng out , the pr ofess or said, ﬁ By  the wa
y Masure(ph), what 
is the formula for 
oxygenated water?ﬂ you know, 
and he was so fu
ll of the compli
cated formula, then 
he went blank, and then he
 had to study again 
and go to Warsaw 
and finally he got 
this M a ster  degr ee, but it t ook m ay b e s i x 
months la ter.  Then
 those three Jewish 
pharm a c ist s t hat  wor k ed in this gov er nm
ent big pharmacy were 
taken out 
and were 
told that Jews cannot work 
in a government job because 
it was not fit for them.  It 
was a very big tragedy for us
 and my father wa
s very, very unhapp
y, but, with the 
help of ot her mem b ers of t h e f am ily and 
his friends, he was abl
e t o buy a pharm ac y 
in 1938 but imagined that, sinc
e he was Jew,  he had no righ
t to buy it so he had to 
pay a Polis h pharm ac ist, and I r e mem ber
 his name wa s Dis
chemsky(ph), and he 
bought the pharmacy in Soli e(ph
).  So, we were 
living in Vienna(ph), and my father 
was c omm ut ing and going t o Solie.  But, t h
ere was, my mother
 was a dent is t an d 
my par e nts  meet at the Univ er
sity of St. Petersburg when
 they were st udent  and it  
took them quit e a while till 
they had the means to get marr
ied.  My mot her was  very  
beautiful women and
 that only _________ 
was a very good prof
essional.  The best 
day of  the week  f or us  was Fr iday bec
ause this was the dat
e that she wasn™t  
work ing.  And, I r em e mber t he pride that 
I felt when I 
was wor king fr om t h e street  
and I nev er  saw m y m ot her 
without their hat and a pair 
of gloves; and strange men 
us ed t o t i p t heir  hat  and sa
y how beaut if u l s h e is , a pr inc es s.  So, I was v ery  pr ou d 
of her, and not only was I very
 proud of her but my mother
 was my best friend.  I 
could talk to her ve
ry open, she was a very alter
ault(ph) and gentle soul and she 
did a lot of deeds when I 
was never told abou
t, but unfortunately 
she, a women who 
was beautiful and 
good, contracted cancer, and Ma
y 24, 1939, she passed away. 
This was a very big defense(ph) tragedy
, a very big tragedy
 for me.   And, I  
rem ember  work ing on the str e
et and the sun was shin ing 
and I said to myself, ﬁMy 
mot her  is  not here and t he wor l d is goi
ng on and the birds 
ar
e singing and t he 
beautiful lilacs are bl
ooming and she™s not 
here.ﬂ  It was a very
, very, bad loss f o r 
me.  An d, me and my sister
 were left two little orphans, 
there we re a lot of other 
women t hat were very keen
 to be our moth
er because my mother was only 40 
year s old when s h e died.  But, my fat her a
nd my mot h er always t o ok  us to all k i nd s  
of concer t, childr en play, oper et
tas; when I was six year s ol
d,  my  f a ther t o ok m e t o 
the library, my moth
er asked him to do it, and si
nce then, a new 
world opened for 
me because I wa s ____________.  An
d, also, a very importan
t part of our life wa s 
my nanny because she 
was taking us, especially me bec
ause I was olde
r,  (I ™m f our 

year s older than my sister, Rachel) was taki
ng me to the park.  
When I was going t o  
the par k, I  had to get  dr es
sed and I had to w
ear  white glov es  and if my nanny  
dec i ded t h at m y c l ot hes wer e
 not pr oper,  s he was t o go 
to the s t or e, we had an 
ac count, s he used t o  or der m at er ial f or 
t h e dress, s he used t o  go t o t h e dr es s 
mak er and then, aft er awhile, 
when t h e bill cam e t o m y fat h er, m y fat h er us ed t o 
say this women will ruin me, 
but she was the only one wh
o™s no afraid of him and 
she was saying to him, ﬁDo you think this is
 r i ght, t hat  our two litt le gir ls ,  wh o look  

like paupers?  Ho w, what 
would t he ot her nannies in t
he park say?ﬂ  So, my father 
was a patafanilias(ph),
 you know, very good 
but stern and his wo rd
 was, even, was, 
I mean, he had t o j us t  t o look at y o u an
d we knew what he me
ant and his word was 
going _________.  And my mother, many ti
mes, she was also 
a bread winner but 
she was intimidated but my
 nanny stood her ground an
d she was saying to my 
mot her , ﬁT he litt le gir l s hav e
 to bend to be litt
le ladiesﬂ and so I 
had the very, very, 
pamper ed childhood and v ery
 good chil dhood.  I loved my
 par e nts  and t h ey r eall y  
gav e m e the best t hat  t hey could.
 
Q: What language do you speak at hom e?
 
A: When my parents, when 
they were young people, they
 st art ed in t he Univers it y  
of St. Petersburg, so 
they spoke Russian
.  ‚Til I was three or 
f o ur year s old,  I  only 
spok e Rus sian and t h en one day , my f ath
er  cam e, and said ﬁW e hav e t o s p ea k  
Poli shﬂ because Vienna(ph) wa s 
____, you know, at time, it 
was like in between, it 
was Russian, it was Polish, 
now it is Lithuanian and eac
h countries brought their  
language so we had to
 read, know, a lot of
 languages, so then 
I started to speak 
Polish; and, I was sent to 
a pr iv ate s c hool, only f or Jewi
sh children, 
but we were  
taught only  Polis h, but  we 
had le ssons in Hebrew and in
 the religious instruction s  
so ‚til I went to the ghetto, I only spoke 
Polish.  When my 
par ent s  s pok e bet ween 
thems e lv es , they spok e a lot of Rus s i
an, so I knew th
ose two languages.
 
Q: What was the relation
ship to your sister?
 
A: I was always told by my father that I am
 the oldest one and I ha
ve to take care of 
her.  And,  als o, m y s i ster  
was a ver y pr etty,  
feminine, little girl and she could get 
away with a lot that 
I couldn™t  because my 
f at her  decided v er y ear ly  th at  I have t o  
be a doct or  and I was 
a good st udent in s c hool but I wa
s  always k new t hat I hav e to 
hav e v er y good gr a
des because, this, I wa
s the oldest one and 
I had t o further my 
education.  My sister wa
s not a too good stu
dent and she didn™t  li ke the _____ _ 
except  s he lik ed pret t y dr es
ses, like that, but she had 
no obligation to
 be a very 
good student because my
 father decided that she is
 going to marry a we ll-to-do 
person, a professional who 
will take very good 
care of her.  
So, it was always 
understood that I was the 
serious one and she was t
he little woman, and we 
ac cept ed it ,  of cour s e, we di
dn™t have big fight 
but sometimes little
 fights like who,  
we had braids, who the nanny,
 who should braid the hair be
fore, me or her?  An d, 

little, little, thi
ngs, but it was always put 
in my mind that  I am
 t h e oldest one and I 
have to take care of her.
 
Q: What did it mean, in
 y o ur hous ehold and y our family, t o be J ewis h?
 
A: You see,  as a c h ild,  I di
dn™t really, was expo
sed to much to the rich because my 
parent s, being st udent s  and be
ing,  and this time with t
he Russian revolution, didn™t, 
were not religious at all.  
And, I really didn™t  even so
 much know that  I was Jewish 
but, later on, we lived in, ve
ry close to, the universit y and
 t h er e wer e r i ot s in, near 
the medical faculty, beca
us e the Jewish student s att ended t he f ac u lt y,  wer e  
suppose to sit on the 
left.  So instead of 
them sitting on the le
ft, they was standing 
up and taking notes 
and when the riots we
r e oc curr ing and t h e 
nanny used to pick 
me up from school, and I 
heard, and then I wa s very mu
ch aware of my father™s 
suff er ing.  My mot h er  had a lot  of 
Polish patienc e and s he had a very good 
reput at ion that she was tak i ng
 out ,  doing ext r act i on, tak i
ng out teet h, and very  big,  
tall, well-to-do, land
owners us ed to c om e with t h
eir horse and buggies and the 
dr iv er  us ed to wait f or  them  and they  to
 go up t o m y mot her , kis s he r hand,  an d 
br ing us fr esh s t rawberries a
nd all this k i nds  and s h e didn
™t h ear it .  But, whe n it  
happened to my father, when 
it happened to the students 
we were well aware that 
we are Jews and that
 we are not wanted.
 
Q: When was that?
 
A: I think t h e riot s st art ed, I would say, as
 far as I remember, my
 farth___(ph) were 
in 1935.  The r i ots at th
e univer s ity was in ‚36- ™37.
  T he P o le s wer e  ver y  
antic i pat ed( ph) and t h ey t o ld t hat all 
t her e misfort unes  wer e
 caused by those 
people that were taking
 away everything from them, th
at those people were well t o  
do, that those people were not 
telling the true, but the truth 
is  that there we re a lot, 
a lot, v er y poor J e ws.   T h
ere was a whole sectio n in 
my town, Vienna(ph), wher e 
there was such a poor Jews living in
 cellars, the childre
n were dying from 
tuber c u los i s and all 
the relat ed sick ness es; but, I 
was alwa ys brought up with the 
mind t hat  c harity ™s  v er y im port a nt .  W e
 alwa ys had boxes for 
orphan children, we 
alwa ys had a box to help Isra
el.  Ev en my parents were
 not, this ti
mes ________. 
And, when my mother pass
ed away, she had a very big 
funeral and a lot of people 
that I didn™t know that exis
t, c am e ov er t o me and t o ld 
m e that ev en she had a ver y  
big practice, all the poor peopl
e, from all around who knew
, that they can come t o  
the dentist, Gutalip
 Carich Masur(ph), in
 the middle of the ni
ght, she will take car e  
of them and she will
 never, never, as
k them for money.  When I was in 
conc entr at ion c am p, I  meet
 a woman who was wor king 
in the k it chen, and she a 
litt le bit mor e br ead, and s he c am e  ov er
 to me and s he gav e
 me one __________ _ 
potato and piece of bread, 
and she says to me, ﬁI am o
ne of t hos e pat i ents t h at  
your mother helpedﬂ and, you k
now, it was in very bad tast
e, in m y  mot h er ™s c i rc le,  

if y o u did s om ething good, yo
u nev er t e ll it, you never br ag 
about it.  You do it an d 
it™s, ...so I never 
knew about it.
 
Q: So the first traged
y in your life rea
lly occurred when your
 _____ mother died?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: And then the second major 
_____ in your life
 was in 1941 when the invasio n  
came, the Polish invasion came?
 
 
 
A: No, no, no.  The second
 one was September 1, 1939,
 when the Germany raided 
Poland; because, as it happens, this  
time, it was summertim e, and I wa s in 
Solie(ph) where my fa
ther had the pharmacy.
  It  was a very sm
all town, maybe 20  
minutes by train from Genow(ph).  An d, me
 and my sist er wer e
 in Solie(ph) o n  
vacation.  And, also, I ha
ve t o ment ion that aft er my  mother pass ed away,  my  
mot her  had an older s i ster,  her name wa
s  Sony a Lick owvit c hper sk y ( ph), who was  a 
regist er ed nurs e and a m i d-
wife;  and s he bec am e our  
second m ot her
.  She was 
alwa ys very close with us
 because those two sist
ers we re very close and 
apparently my mother
, on her death bed, as
ked her t o take care
 of her two little 
gir ls, so s h e becam e our s ec o nd mot her
, and s h e s p end, s om et im es summer t im e ,  
she went t here to Solie(ph)  wit h  us  and 
t h en s h e left  us  and
 went back to her 
hus band in Vienna( ph) wher e was  her res i d
ence, s he didn™t hav e c h ildren.  And,  so,  
on September 1, I was in Solie(ph) and, 
as it happens, there wa s a pact made. 
Vienna(ph) became a part of
 Lithuania and So lie became a 
part of White Russia. 
S o we  wer e, we ™re  n o w on ly
 with our f ather and we 
were separated from our 
second m o ther and it was j u
st t e rrible, but  our whole li
fe was up-side-down, from 
this  t im e, bec a us e when t he Rus sian c ame 
t o Solie,  y o u know,  
the first thing what  
they did, they s a id that  my father is a ri
c h man.  They called 
him bourgeois and they 
didn™t give him a passport and he was now 
like an enemy of the 
people.  Even he, 
he didn™t do anything to..., 
he was working very hard
 to be an owner, he w a s 
cons ider ed per sona- n ongr att a( ph) and I 
couldn™t go to schoo
l in So lie becaus e 
there wa s no high school and
 I  j ust  st art e d go t o high 
school,  so I was sent  to a 
town c a lled Dus h anit over( p h)
 was the high school and my
 f ather rented a r oom  
there and I attended this sc
hool and I was alwa ys, a
lways, separated from my 
sist er, was staying wit h  my 
father in Solie( p h) bec aus
e ther e was a gramm ar s c hoo l 
there.  So t here v er y, v ery, 
big upheaval and I was studying
 ther e ‚t il 19
41.  I visited 
onc e, my aunt, and I  had ot her  fam ily, 
m y aunt , my  sec ond and t h at was in 
Vienna( ph) and I had all t he,
 t w o c ous ins.  Becaus e m y f at her arr anged som eho w 
to gave a permission 
during the vacation, to 
come to visit them. 
 An d, wh en  I c am e  
there and stay ed wit h  my 
Aunt, I wa s looking for my friends from my school, 
_________ and it wa s 
a complete division, my sc
hool, my beloved school...the 

children couldn™t go there be
cause they had to learn Li
thuanian and so
me of them 
went to the Polish school.  
It was a big, big, upheaval in
 our young life
.  So when I 
came back, I was heart
br ok en bec aus e ev eryt hing t h at
 was dear t o me
 was kind of 
destroyed.  But, th
en came June, 1941
...this was when the Ge
rman army came to 
our town, but before
 t h ey cam e, I want ed t o t e ll y ou t h at  my fat h er was t hr o wn  out  
from,  by t h e Rus s i an,  from the pharm ac y, 
and he was made a ma
nager in 
a little 
town called Astroegetts(ph), so
 they had t o mov e t h ere. 
 And, of cour se, he was  
very disappointed, but he wa
s trying to do his best a
nd he became 
very friendly 
with a young doctor that wa s living just near us, and th
is was actually in his only 
com panion bec aus e the c u lt ur al
 level of the town people we
re very low.  So here I 
am in Astroegetts(ph), I ju
st came for vacation, it  was June,  and I™m sitting an d 
reading a book, and I 
remember what book
 I was reading...I wa
s reading the book 
in Russian and it
 was by t h e s on of T o
lstoy and it  was about 
Peter the Great.  And, 
I am sitting and reading the 
book and they are 
describing, describi
ng the banquette 
with all kinds of exotic food
 that they are giving and 
they are talking about black 
grapes, that I never saw in
 my life in Po land with
in _____________ and they are 
talk ing about peaches that 
I never saw and here I am
 reading this book and the 
maid came running fr om the 
pharm ac y and s ay i ng ﬁYour f at h er  want s y ou righ t  
away, the German invaded
 and t hey are coming t o our  
town.ﬂ  We we re strangers 
in Astorgetts(ph)...we j ust c
ouldn™t make friends in such 
a short  t im e so we didn™t  
hav e, lik e, roots t her e.  When I cam r u
nning, ther e was a tr
uck standing wit h  
Russian doctors and
 Russian nurses who we
r e good fr iends of  my  f at her  and t hey  
asked my father we
 should go on th
e truck and they will take 
us to Russia.  And, my 
fat her  took me and my  s ist er int o t he r
oom and said, ﬁMy childr
en, during the war, a 
person has to have a roof 
over their head, a 
r o of is v ery  im por tant.  I  k n ow th e 
Germ an invit e d us when we wer e in 
Poland and so
me how they 
were eve n  
___________ so I d
on™t belie ve that they will do any 
harm to me, after all, I am a 
law-abiding person and I am professional.ﬂ 
 So, we were standing
 there...as soo n  
as the Russian left, in a few 
more hours, the maid  of t
he young doctor, there was a 
friend of my father came running up and said
 that the doctor to
ld me to tell you 
there will be a pr ogr am (y ou 
know what is  a program) to
night and since you are the 
most prominential in this
 town, you will be 
the first one.  So
 he said, ﬁLeave 
everything and go someplace,
 because you will be killed.ﬂ 
 There was a rabbi in the 
town, so my father went to the rabbi a
nd t o
ld him and the rabbi s a id, ﬁO k ay,  you 
stay here.ﬂ  And, low and 
behold, this  night 
was a very big progr
am...we heard it. 
Ther e wer e  peas a nt(ph) wit h t h os e big t h ings
 that you clean the 
street, I forgot ho w 
to say it in English...
 
Q: Rakes?
 
A: Rakes!  With rakes runn
ing ar ound and beat
ing up all the Jews 
and it was a ver y  
big,  v er y big, pr ogr am , in 
t o wn, and they  wer e all look
ing for us.  ﬁW
here is the 

pharm a c ist ?ﬂ ______ and we wer e s itt ing in
 the hidden room and
 they didn™t come 
to the Rabbi.  I don™t what wa
s, but it was luck.  So, the 
next day, in the morning, we  
came out and we we
nt to our house and one of the 
we ll-to-do Polish 
people, that 
went ____,  was als o pers ecut ed by a Russ ia
n, came to my father and said that ﬁI 
will take your belongings and
 you come to me 
because, and you 
were good to me 
and I will help you 
out and he had a very
 big, not a palace, 
a very big farm hous e 
and a lot of landing(ph)
.  So, my father and my sist
er took a baggy
 and put some 
belongings and ended up going there and I wa
s sitting in the 
house with other 
belongings.  On the way, th
e Pole s with rakes saw them
 and took everything away, 
put my father against 
the tree, and shot him.
..and my  lit t le s ist er  was  ten (s p),  or  
maybe 12 years old, somethi
ng, saw it...
and grazed his right hi
p, he didn™t shot in 
to( ph)  but graz ed, and his arm wa
s...and they we
r e mov e d along.

Q: Interview with Lily Mazu
r(ph) Margules, conducted 
by __________ 
on August 
27, 1996, at Lily 's home 
in the Bronx, New York.  Th
is is t ape one,  s i de B.
 
A:  St ill today, I don't know
 if  it was staged, th
at he wanted to rob 
us, this  Pole, or it 
was just, just one of
 those things that the peasants were wild 
and they were, they 
just attacked him.  
So there I was sitting 
and I, when I saw my 
father all bloody and 
there is, ther e ar e no word t h at  I can de
scribe you, but I 
was very concerned 
because my little sister be
came very hy ster ic
al and she couldn't cry because we 
had to be very quiet. 
 Our life was in dange
r.  So  we  left ever
ything that
 we had 
there, all our goods, and we
 went again to the Rabbi
.  And in t h e m or n ing ,  
somehow, my father
 contacted a p
easant and ga
v e him  a s um of money a nd he,  
asked him to take us 
to Vilna to my aunt .  After my father came with this, all 
bleeding, something happen
ed to my dog, Rex.  He wa
s so attached to
 us, he was 
like a member of my family.  When my mo
ther passed away, he 
was s itt ing t here in 
the room bec a us e in Europe 
y ou didn't put the cask et in
 a fu n er a l ho me, it was in  
the room, so he was 
sitting and he went, and he wa s ho
wling, it was a 
terrible howl, 
but ther e was no way t hat he
 would move from my mother
's casket.   He was sitting 
toget her wit h me and I spent 
the night with him there.  
W hen t h ere was t h e fu ner al, 
he want ed to go in t he f uner al cort ege 
and he became wild 
whe n t h ey had t o  
subdue him and put him in th
e r o om.  He was v ery m uc h 
attached to us
.  When my 
father came and al
l bloody, something 
happened to this  dog 
and he, had like a 
paralysis and his head turned to
 the side.  And my father 
took him out to a field and 
asked som ebody t o shoot him. 
 And it was lik e an end of  
an er a.  Becaus e t h is do g 
was like, everything what 
was good and carefr
ee and pink and colorful in our 
childhood.  So next day
, we got up very, very early 
in the morning and this peasant 
took a wagon of hide, and put  us t her
e,  cam o uf laged us and we had lik e  
babus h kas( ph), and he t o ok us,  aft er a 
few hours, we came very early in the 

morning to Vilna.  And he 
left us in a place that I wa
s not even familia
r where, how 
wher e.  And I als o didn't know that ther
e was then a c u rfew of 
Jews, that the Jews 
could just walk  a certain hour
s, and the Jews  h
ad to have yellow, a st ar, this, Star s 
of Dav i d, and t h ey als o had 
to walk in the gutter.  So 
it  took us a f e w hours and I  
was walking with my si
st er on the str eet lik e two litt
le P o lis h g ir ls .   An d whe n m y  
aunt saw us, she thought that we came 
from the other side, 
who know what.  Of 
cour se,  she was ver y, ve
ry happy and we were in Vilna.   A few days later, my father 
came.  And my father
, from all t he aggr av at ion of ev
er yt hing, bec a me ill and had a 
ver y big absc es s.  And als o, in Vilna, th
e Jews  were persecut
ed like subhumans. 
Ev er y day,  new edicts  were com i ng.  W e 
couldn't have a radio,
 we couldn't have a 
jewe lr y, we couldn't have a wa
tch, we couldn't 
have properties, we
 couldn't talk to 
gent iles.  I mean, we were 
plain ostr ac iz es.  And ev ery 
day they us ed t o c om e  and 
take out men a
nd young boys and they used to
 disappear and 
the women never 
knew where they were an
d what was done to these 
young __________.  One of 
my uncles,  my mot h er's sist er's husb
and, was taken from 
the street, he was 
standing and reading an
 edict, he was taken from the 
street and she 
never saw him 
again.  So the situation was 
v ery,  ver y t e ns e and m y f at h
er was very ill and he was 
afr a id t o go out in t h e street.  But  once he bec am e s o ill and the abs cess t h at  he 

had was s o  big that during th
e night, he dec i ded that he ha
d t o go, s o 
my uncle and 
my aunt took him by the ha
nd and they were walk
ing in the middle 
of the night, they 
took him to a hos p it al t hat 
was in the Jewish se
ct ion, it was a J e wish hos p ital.   And 
he was st aying t her e.   And my ot her un
c l e no, nev er  went 
out.  An d when the 
Gest apo us ed t o come and as k 
if there ar e m en t h er e, s
he used to co
me out and, 
luckily, they would look in
 a f e w r ooms and my, he wa
s c amouf laged, som et h ing,  
so m y unc l e was nev e r 
fo un d.  S o it wa s, u nt i l, u nt i
l, I don't remember exactly the 
date, I think it was Ju
ne 6, 19, no, no,  no, Sept em ber  
6, 1941, that an edict came 
that all the Jews have to go 
to the ghetto.  But it was su
ch a diabolic, diabolic plan , 
a m a ster  plan, t h e way  they di
d it.  There was, as
 I told you, there was a section, a 
Jewish s e c t ion in t h e heart  of
 Vilna, a very, very cult ur
al town that had a lot of 
theat er s, ar chives and mus e ums  and it  had, 
and Jewish, very rich
 Jewish li
fe with 
libraries and all kinds of so
cieties and charit able organiza tion.  And there were a lot 
of J e wis h doct or s that had a 
J e wish hos p ital.   And als o, ther
e were a lot of facilities 
for poor Jewis h childr e n.  
In t h
e heart of Vilna was a 
section wher e ver y poor Jews 
lived, it was in very bad 
c ondit i ons.  T h e G erm an c am e t her e in t he m iddle of t he 
night, with trucks, told all 
those Jews to walk out, put 
them on t h e truc ks and t oo k  
them to a pr is on c a lled Luk is hk e( ph) and al
so took them to a 
place, a big forest 
called Ponar e(ph), it was a place wher
e those Jews was li
ned up and shot 
discriminately, first they had to make their 
own grave, and they we
re falling in thos e 
graves.  When I wa
s in ghetto, sick in the 
hospital, that I will tell
 you later, 
one of the 
woman who escaped between th
e dead bodies ca
me to the ghe
tto and in the 
beginning when she was just 
a little lucid, she described
 what happened to her, so 

we knew for a fact that  it
 was happening.  An
d then, aft e r a f e w day s, s he lo st her  
mind.  I still remember her 
yelling and screaming 
and crying after 
the children that 
she lo st there, after the family.  So  it wa
s, a very diabolic  plan
 how to do it.  When 
we were told to go
 t o  the ghett o , they  c am e, ev
erything wa s done early in the 
mornin g, and my uncle, Yo
sef(ph) Perski(ph), said to
 my aunt, "Look
, I am not 
going to the ghetto".  He wa
s,  had a ver y big adv a ntage, he does n't  lo ok  J e wis h, h e  
look like a gentile, he look 
lik e a Pole and he was a busi
nes s m an that had a lot of  
connections with Polish peas
ants.  He wa
s buying wood there fr
om them and also 
dr ied m ushrooms,  he says,  "I
 am  going t her e a
nd I want y ou t o go wit h me".   She 
says,  s he, my aunt Sonj a, 
who was like a second mother 
to us, said to him, "I  
promised my sister on
 her death bed that 
I am, be a second mo
ther and I will take 
care of those two little girl
s, Lilla(ph) and Rhya(ph)," th
is was how we were called, 
"And I won't leave them alone".  We didn't
 know about it.  So 
they kissed and he 
sneaked out and he went.  We
 never heard from him.  An
d she went with us to the 
ghetto.  Before he le
ft, he gave us a few things to pu
t on and as we
 were walkin g 
on t h e str e et, I had one c oat 
and one rain coat and the Pole s were li ned up on the 
street and look ing at, and I 
will nev er f orget  that t hey
 said, " L ook  at thos e J e ws, 
they have two coats".  So
 they were, nobody of them 
lifted a finger and said, 
"Com e, I give you f ood, I wo
n't let you go to 
the ghett o",  bec aus e t hey r e ally were 
rejoicing what was happening to
 us.  There were two gh
ettos and one ghetto, the 
people that were taken to o
ne ghetto, this was the ghetto 
that I was, were destined 
to leav e.  The ot her ghett o, a lot of pe
ople wer e t ak en, again, to t h e Luk i shk e  
prison, from there to 
Ponare, and th
ey were simply shot.  So
 this way the have the 
liquidated a lot of Jews.  Be
fore the war, 
before 1939, th
ere were 80,000 Jews in 
Vilna.   Vilna was  a c u lt ur e 
c e nt er , wit h many inst it ut ions, it was  a c u ltur e J e wis h  
cent er t h at was lik e a magnet
 from all the people that wa
nted to soak 
up and had a 
nice cult ural experience.  
So slowly, slowly  the Jewish population we
re reduced and 
also, at this  time, there were
 all other people, Jews, that 
escape from Au
stria, that 
escape from Germany, that es
cape from Po land, that look
 for solace in Vilna, an d 
they, unf ort unat e, wer e als o 
put to live in the 
ghetto.  I can talk 
f or  hour s and hour s  
about those condit ions that 
we re in the ghetto.  It is 
indescribable.  One room was 
habitated four or five
 family.  There was 
no sanitary conditions
, there was not even 
enough wat er.  The r at i ons wer e
 terrible, I m e
an, it' s not  t o
 liv e and not t o die.  And  
the most important thin g is, that the ________
__.  All those people 
that were doers, 
that were thinkers, that were wr it ers,  
became so helpless,  
so degradated, so 
broken up, that they just c
ouldn't exist.  I remember th
at my father, whenever that 
there was something in the family, they  us
ed to come, they wi
th Mazur, he knew 
everything, he was, he felt 
that he can help, he felt th
at  he can,  so was t he m ost  
helples s person in t he ghett o
.  He was like a 
hunted animal and I thin k this was the 
biggest injustice that wa
s done to Jewish people.  By
 dehumanize them.  The 
taking away their self-estee
m, the taking away their pr
ide, the taking away their 

human dignity.  I know that you want to 
ask m e how I meet m y
 father.  Yeah? 
Okay, y o u can as k m e .
 
Q: Actually, I wanted to ask you, at this 
time, you and your sist
er were two teenage 
girls.
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: How did, how did you cope, how
 did y ou f eel at t h e t i me?  
 
A: I felt very bad.  I felt
 very bad becau
se I wa s emotionally br
oken up.  I remember, 
I was walking with my
 s ist er  in the ghett o  and we 
were surrounded 
with walls an d 
there was one ver y big door, lik e  an op
ening, wh at was mind
 from one side for 
Jewish policemen, for the ot
her side by Gestapo and 
Lithuanian policemen.  So 
com e out and come in, we wer e, t here was 
a lot of, y o u had t o hav e paper s.  But I 
remember walk ing with my 
sister around and we were
 standing by a wall and I 
hear d fr om the ot her s i de, hum an voices, 
walking and I heard ch
ildren and I, I could 
hear t h at t h ey wer e going and als o I hear d
 t he c ar, m u sic fr om a car o us el.  And I 
was standing there and
 I was thinking, will you tell me
 that nobody ca
res about us ? 
Will you tell me that childre
n ar e going t o s chool, t h ey 'r e going to t h e mov i es, t ha t  
people are going, doing thei
r jobs and nobody 
cares?  This was the hope, the 
biggest, I was hung
ry, I was dirty, I was really  in ra
gs.  I was cold, bu
t what's hurting 
me, I wa s humiliated.  And I 
couldn't understand that nobo
dy in the world will speak 
up f or us and as k, " W hy ?  
What ar e thos e people, how thos e people m i str eat ed? 
Why did they do, why ,  how 
ar e t hey s i ngled out, t o be put to s u ch a tort ur e and  
misery?"  And this was the 
biggest, the biggest thing th
at I couldn't understand.  
 
Q: So how did y ou meet up wit h y our fat h er ?
 
A: You s ee,  I was ther e wit h, in this  ro
om and onc e my aunt, 
who was a nurs e, was  
walk ing on the street  and 
she met somebody that  she knew and she said to her, 
"Wher e ar e you going?"  And 
she says, "I am going to th
e hospit al, I hope that my 
br other- in- l aw is ther e".  She s ay s to me, 
" O h, y our br ot her- in- l aw is in the hospit a l 
and he is  crying, he 
is crying, where are his daughters
, where are his, where is  his 
family ?  He is beside himsel
f, he doesn't want to get be
tt er".   And s h
e took her by 
the hand and showed him wh ere 
he was.  So he stayed 
a ver y s hort 
time in the 
hospital, they didn't pamper peopl
e, they didn't have
 time for this.  
Later on he came 
and he stayed with us.  In 
a very short time after, we 
wer e st ar v ing and also,  m y  
fat her was a sm ok er, he sm ok ed, so t h is, t h
e c i garett e that he sm ok ed, they were  
not real cigarette
, but a hom emade cigar ett e, many 
times I used to 
wake up and I 
us ed to s e e him sm ok ing at 
night.  An d once he went out
 and he f o und a job, they 
were lo oking for people to wo
rk in, not as a pharmacist, 
but to wo rk in a Spanish 
hos p ital that wer e out s i de the ghetto. 
 And he was going ev
ery day and he was 

working there just as a laborer.  And t
hen one day, he met 
somebody and they and 
they t o ld him they  are look ing f or  a pharma
cist t o look in, t o
 work in a pharmacy 
bec aus e it was t he Jewis h ho
sp it a l th at wa s  in t h e ce n t
er of t h e g hetto and t he y  
needed a pharmac ist.  So he 
was very happy and 
very elated and, of course, they 
took him r i ght in and he wa
s wor king in t he pharm a cy.  
We were starving so much 
that at night sometimes we c
ouldn't sleep.  And they give 
us such a small ration that 
they gave us t h is piece of
 bread when we came home,
 me and my sister, we  
finis h ed alr eady t h e br ead,  s o
 you know.  As  mu
c h as m y aunt want ed t o s h ar e the 
rations with us and may time
s she shared with us, it wa
s not enough.  
So  one day I  
dec i ded, I heard t hat people ar e going out s i
de the ghetto and they
 ar e work ing.  So 
one time I got up 
very early in the mornin
g and we had, in the 
middle of the ghetto, 
a place called Judenrat(ph) 
and there were people that, 
from the Jewish, that 
community, that were lik
e in char ge of t he 
ghetto, they were, an
d one of t hos e t ha t  
was in c h ar ge of t h e ghett o was Jac ob 
Gentz( ph),  who was an off i cer in th e 
Lithuanian army and he was like a Jewish 
commander of the gh
etto.  And right 
there there was a very big place and Ge
rman used to come
 and take men and 
women, we were always segr
egated, to work and I was 
lu cky enough that I was 
recr uited by this Ge
rman, his name wa s Kr
aus(ph).  And he t
ook, he took me to 
work.  There was, ma
ybe a handed, two 
handed young girls, and 
he, he took us out 
from the ghetto and we were
 work ing on t he c o bbles t o
nes and we were working, 
working, working a lo ng time
.  And all of a sudden, 
the whole column stopped and 
to my am azem ent, t h ey st opped in fr ont 
of  the pr ivate sc hool wher e I s p end t he 
happiest days of my 
life.  They took us
 down there, the school
 was occupied by 
Gestapo and from the classr
ooms they made offices.  
And t her e was  a very big  
cellar t her e that when I was 
a student, I didn't 
even know that that existed.  And 
they put us into this big 
cellar and the cellar was full
 with pot at oes  and we had t o  
sort out the potatoes , they were rotten 
and s o there I was,
 sitting in this 
__________, in this big 
cellar and I was thinking, this
 must be a ni
ghtmare.  I 
want ed t o  r un, r u n out  from 
ther e, run t o one of m y c las
srooms, sit down in my seat, 
there was sitting late
, and I said to myself, I am ru
nning out, I will ta
ke the hardest 
test, I don't care.  A
nd then all of a sudden I see 
a man wa lkin g there and taking 
care of chicken, ther e were a few chicken 
there in the cellar. 
 He looked terrible, 
__________, this was Pr ofessor 
Morgenstern(ph), he was the 
latest of my teachers 
and he was lik e
 t he t eac her that  took ca
re of our c l as s.  And when m y mot her  
pass ed away and in our relig
ion, for seven days, we sit shiv a, he came to my house 
and he was  talk ing t o me, be
cause when my moth
er was sick, m y gr ades fell ver y  
badly because I didn't want
 to st udy and I was t h er e 
always t h e teac her' s pet.  I  
was very good studen
t.  And he was talkin
g to me and he
 said,  "Look,  I'm sur e  that 
you, if you will just put your
 head to it, you 
can have a makeover
 test and you will 
hav e better  gr ades".   But I r em e mber s a y ing 
to him, "I really, at
 this point, I reall y  
don't care.  For me
, the world is finished".  So
 to my amazement, Professor 

Morgenstern is standi
ng there and taking care of the ch ic ken.  You see, we are not 
supposed to socializ e with men,
 this was the biggest crime,
 but I r a n ov er to him, I 
said, "Professor Morgenstern"
.  But he didn't recognize
 me.  He  we nt through a 
very big tragedy. 
 In his presence, his 
wife and his daughter an
d his son were shot. 
And he was in such a stat e of shock, that 
he was just like an out
 mad(ph).  As  I was 
sit t ing t her e cry i ng, afr a id t o
 cry loud bec a us e there wer e , fu
ll of s ad,  I see t he door  
opens and two gir l s and a 
man ar e coming out, t h is wa
s the janitor and his two 
Polish daughter.  When I was 
a little girl and 
we were going to 
school, the janitor 
and his t w o daught er s were 
always helping us with galoshes because the clim ate in 
our town was very severe
 in winter t ime and m a ny  tim es we would shar e our  
lunc hes, we c o ns ider ed them our fr iend. 
 When they  saw m e s itt ing ther e,  they  
said, "Look at this li
ttle Lilka(ph), we thought that 
all Jews were killed in Ponar". 
This was  the hello t h at  I had fr om  them. 
 They were standing
 with their hands on 
their hips and t h ey were pr act ic a lly la
ughing.   Okay, t h e day ended and I c am e 
home and I was besi
de myself.  It was just
 a little bit to
o much f or me t o go to th e 
sc hool,  to s ee m y pr of es sor 
and to hear those talk ing. 
 Anyhow, look, I was going 
there and work ing t h er e for 
a long, long time.  And on
e adv a nt age was  that we 
could br ing a few raw potat o es
, but by the entrance, if th
ey would caught us with 
potatoes, we would be shot
 on site.  But we
 learned how to ca
mouflage it , you 
know, and sometime
s we were lucky, they
 would let us through
, and those potatoes 
were v ery  helpf ul bec a us e m y f ather us ed 
to sell them and we
 could buy something 
else.  After a while
 this job finished and this same
 German took us
 to an airport 
called Porbanek(ph) and, again, I started to
 work in Pr obanek. 
 We we re working 
long, long, long time
.  They brought us ov
er, they used to 
always line us up and 
count us and t h e j ob wit h it
 wa s unload big pieces of
 coal, unload wood, unload 
potat o es and m a ny t i mes in the winter ,  we
 had t o c lean the air p or t.  The sn ow was  
falling and there we were.  
A n d we  sa w t ho se milit ary 
litt le planes c o ming down an d 
all t h os e milit ary  m e n in 
their white wa rm coats and 
t her e we wer e fr eez i ng 
pr act i cally, we had no,  no war m  c l othes and
 I had a v er y big pr oblem bec a us e th e 
shoes that I had were falling 
apart.  So my fat
her went to the J
udenrat and they 
gave me a pair  of shoes, 
they were wooden clumps(p
h).  They were wooden, yo u 
know, and with presented some
 material, when I 
was working in t
he snow I couldn't 
walk because the snow was, it 
was just st icking, so it wa
s a very big deal.  But one 
day, when we were li ned up
, I was lucky.  Ever y day fo
ur women were chosen to 
go into the barracks
 and c
l ean.   T h is  was  a very  
big thing because
 you, it  was 
wintertime, you didn't have 
to freeze.  And I was lucky,
 I wa s c ho s en wit h a l l t ho s e 
four wom e n.  So ther e I was, st anding in 
this big place, and I 
was given a buc k et o f  
water and a mop and I have t o
 m op t h os e barr ac ks.  Her e y ou have m e, I wa s just  
a school girl, who never in her life boiled a po
t of tea.  I didn't know it.   So there 
were, the other three wome
n who were more 
experienced _______
___, took their 
buck et and they knew what  to 
do.  They took me 
and put  it in t h is  big r oom that  yo u 

couldn't see from one end 
to another and the floor 
was dirty and t h er e I wa s  
standing, I didn't know how to start.  I know
 how to do it today
, but I didn't know 
then and I was standing there 
and crying, bitter 
tears.  All of a sudden, like an 
apparition, a very high Germ
an of ficer is  coming with
 a few younger
 __________ 
ar ound him  and he s e es m e and he says t o
 me, "W hat ar e y ou 
doing here?"  And 
at this time, I spoke a very
 good G erm an y et,  today I  
cannot speak Ge
rm an, I  hav e 
a mental block.  In a very
 clear __________ German
, I said to him,
 "I am Jewish, 
brought in from ghetto
 to wash it 
and I don't know 
how to do it".

elf, he was s o  
brainwashed that he was beside
 himself that the Jewish y
oung girl can talk  to him 
intelligently, can explain to 
him, can cite
 poetry, can read, an
d he gave me the  
book, but I was afraid 
to take it.  I said 
to him, if  they cau
ght  m e,  by t he gu ar d,  
_________wit h the German boo
k, I was _________.  
 
I am telling you, to illustr
ate to you, how the German
 people were brainwashed, 
because if  he was a high of
ficer, he had a _________educat
io n.  How could he let, 
to come to this level 
that he could thin k by 
himself, and he couldn™t  
dist inguis h. ..and,  in m y exper ienc es,  dur ing 
t he Naz i  er a, I  had a f e w enc o unt ers .  
Once I met with someb
ody that will talk and that he is the director of the Munich 
Opera.   That he was also an officer.  He 
was in the Assess(ph), 
and that he couldn™t 
understand when I told him t
hat as a chil d, I knew the 
Lehar(ph) operettas, I knew 
the opera; he couldn™t u
nderstand that the Jews were 
all so cultured, people that 
ar e pr of es s i onals, that they
 wer e not c h eat er s, and not 
liars, and not 
bloodsucker.  
It was beside him, and he 
couldn™t understand this.
 
Q: When t h e day cam e  when y o u were f or c
ed to leav e the ghett o, would y o u s a y a 
little more ab
out the period of events then?
 
A: Well, as I told you befo
re, the conditions in ghetto 
were very, very bad, an d 
because I worked outside, I could help a litt
le bit and we could 
surv...we were not 
star v i ng, and also bec a us e my
 aunt was a nurse, she fou
nd herself also a job.  She 
was selling vitamins, so
me kind of concocti
on.  So we were st
arving and surviving 
but _________ one su
mmer, t h is was the summer of 
1943, I was  walk ing bar ef oo t  

in  _________ because those sh
oes were so uncomfortabl
e that I just, whenever I 
had t h e c h anc e, I was  tak e t h em
 off and I st ep on a r us t ic
 nail, and I was afraid to 
tell the German that was 
supervising him because only 
a J e w, or a J e wes s or a 
Jewess girl could use, be 
use for them; what 
good otherwis e we were shot from 
that...so when I came 
home, the infect
ion started and from my
 big toe of my righ t 
leg t o hip I had t he r ed thing and my fat h er
 k new a doct or, a s ur geon in th e hospit a l,  
so he went  ther e and 10 o™
clock at night I had an opera
tion and I wa
s put in the 
hos p ital and I didn™t work anym
ore but I was in the hospital
.  But, I have to describe  
you a little bit, the life in th
e ghetto.  Despit e all the conditi
ons, the terrible  condit ion,  
there was  a cult ur al life br ewing ther e. 
 Ther e wer e people t h
at open a classic 
_________ that were h
andsome, there were 
young songwriters, th
ere were getting 
kind of performances, there 
were all a resistan
t movement.  Peopl
e were escaping 
through the source and go
ing to the pat ____
_____ in the nearb
y woods.  Ther e 
was a very big forest ca
lled Rudnetska(ph) 
forest and 
there was also a pap 
_________ in the _________, 
it was not dirty, it was...
stained water...how you call 
it ?
 
Q: Pond?
 
A: A big pond! 
 
Q: A lake?
 
A: Yes, Na dach(ph) La
ke.  An d, around of _________.  
And I know that a lot of m y  
friends es c aped t hr o
ugh the sewers, threw to pa
p _________ and 
were fighting 
there.  Unfortunately, I didn™t have th
e m o ney bec ause when we c am e t o  the 
ghetto, we were ruined because ever
ything was _________
 from _________ and 
in order to be _________
 you had to have a gun and a 
gun at this time was like 
2000 _________ , a lot 
of money, so I wa s 
approached if I woul
d like to join th e 
partis an(ph).  First of all, I couldn™t 
leave my sister, _______
__ was younger one 
and she was not available to 
go, and I wouldn™t  leave my 
family  so I didn™t go; but, 
there was a lot of r es i stant act i v it y going 
on and I don™t want y
ou t o think that  the 
young people from Vienna were going like 
sheep to the slaught
er, no, a few day s  
befor e the liquidat i on of 
the ghetto, the ghetto resistan
ce was throwin
g papers an d 
say ing t he Jews, y ou ar e going t o the s l au
ght er, y ou ar e going t o
 die anyhow, if yo u 
hav e a stone, if y ou have anyt hi
ng, if you have a stic k.  
I even have, I 
found, I had a 
paper, the days r es i st ant was dis t ribut ing 
and ther e was a lot of distur banc es wit h 
the res ist ant fear of Vietenbur g( ph)  that 
c am e, that Gest apo c am e t o t he ghett o and  
said that if you don™t give 
Vietenburg(ph) the whole ghetto
 will be destroyed and this 
_________  Vietenburg(ph) who wa s dres
sed as a woman gave himself up 
because he didn™t want to have on his 
c onsc i enc e that the whole ghett o  was  
destr oy e d.
 

When I was in the hospital, 
one day I heard a very big co
mmotion in the back yard 
and I was in very po
or shape but I brok
ed through th
e window and I 
saw Gestapo 
truc k st anding in fr ont of th
e phar mac y and I  saw my f a th
er in his white coat an d 
ot her  people t ak e n out  from t h e pharmacy  and 
put in this truck.   I st arted to ye ll 
ﬁFatherﬂ; my father saw 
me _________ and he 
was taken away fr
om pharmacy and 
was taken away to Estonia(ph
) labor camp.  It was very 
turbulent time
 because the 
Gestapo was coming 
to G e nz( ph) ev ery d ay,  and dem anding mor e and mor e  
people; and they were
 coming in the middle of the 
night taking people from beds 
and putting them in 
a column in the fron
t they would put a fi
ddler, the fiddler was 
playing music to sooth the people...brainwa
sh the people...and ta
ke them out from 
the ghetto.  And, we
 never saw them again.  There 
were a lot of 
rumors in the 
ghett o t h at the liquidat i on of
 the ghetto is very
 soon.  We knew 
that the surrounding 
little towns were being li
quidated and we  even knew 
about Panado(ph) Forest and 
about the crematory and Gues
 _________ .  So, 
when I was in t
he hospit al, I was 
in such a poor shape 
that my wound wa
s full of puss and didn™
t heal; but one night, 
my aunt came and said that
 she heard rumors that all 
the people from the hospit al 
will be taken because Genz(p
h) decided he better get
 the sick people than the 
young people.  So, she said th
is is not the plac e f or y ou.
  So she took
 me out and 
we went to our room and in 
the m i ddle of the night, a fr ie
nd of my father came to us 
and s a id t hat hear d the 
rumor that tomorrow would 
be liquidation
 from the 
ghetto...that he has a se
cret room, we used to
 call it Mileana(ph) 
this is in Polish, 
and we will wait in this room 
till the German leave us and
 then we will go maybe to 
the partisan(ph) and he had bui
lt t h is  s ecr et r o om and bec
ause he knew
 my father, 
he in cluded me, my aunt 
and my little sister and we  took
 there.  And,
 the only thing 
that we had to eat was a he
ad of gr een c abbage.  As we
 were sit t ing t her e, we 
heard all kinds of co
mmotion, and they always ______
___ it wa s already early in 
the morning, and it was Se
ptember 23, 1943.  The big 
heavy commode,  you know, 
was moved and Ukrainians and Lithuanians
 and Germans came
 running and the 
Ukrainians were yelling in Ru
ssian, ﬁGive me your
 watch, jussy(ph
), jussy(ph). 
They wa nted to rob us right 
away and they all t
ook us to t he c ent er of t he ghetto,  
they separated the me
n fr om t
he wom en.  Of c our s e, I meet t h er e, m y other  aun t  
and with her daughter and he
r son was already taken a
nd her son™s wife; we all 
stuck together.  An d, they to
ok us out through 
the gates of the ghe
tto, and we were  
walk ing, walk ing, and they took us to
 a very big place 
called the Rosa(ph) 
Cemeter y( p h).  When we came t o the Cem e
tery, the first thi
ng we saw was three 
young bodies hanging and
 dangling in the wind; ther
e was a girl and two young 
boys...they were pak 
_________ .  They we
re caught, and this is how they 
brainwashed us and in timidate
d us and made us afraid to
 move, to escape, to plan 
som et h ing,  a r i ot or whatever.  O n t h is 
Ar os a( ph)  Cem et ery, it  was s uc h an er ie  
feeling, like the deat h was wa
t ching ov er us.   W e were s epar at ed,  men separ a t e  
and women separate and we hav
e...there is a sele
ction.  The one th
at goes to life 

go to the r i ght and t he one t h at go t o t he 
left ar e going t o deat h.
  And, you know, the 
woman said that mothers wi
th young chil dren are going
 to the left, old people are 
going t oo, only able bodies 
are going to the right; and my
 sister at this  time was 
pretty young and she 
looked much youn
ger, so my aunt Sonya 
took off a pair of her 
shoes and they had the litt
le  heel and she pu
t them on and she 
made her a bust 
and s he told her t o s t raight
en out, and we  were
 walk ing,  my sister was in the 
cent er, m y  aunt on one s i
de and I from the other side
 and as we 
came to the 
select ion, t he G erm an pushed 
my aunt to the left and me 
and my sister to the right 
and I st art e d t o cr y and I s a id
 ﬁI want  to go wit h my mo
ther,ﬂ and he had a big rif l e 
and a v ery big st ic k, s o  he 
beat m e and he s a id to m e, y o u ar e t oo y oung, y o u hav e  
to work f or the phat a lan( ph).   
And I said, ﬁBut, I want to 
go with my mother!ﬂ  H e  
beat me again and I neve
r saw my aunt again.  
She went to the left.
 
As we were going to the se
lection, we saw little child
ren that were abandoned by 
their parents, not men, but 
there was one little
 boy, I will never 
forget him...was 
may b e thr e e y ear s old,  he was a beaut if u
l boy  and the as sessm
ent(ph) was hold ing 
him and he was crying
 ﬁM am a,  Mam a!ﬂ   Th
is is what they di
d, they took young 
mothers and they separated 
them from the children.  
What is...I don™t think that 
there is  a bigger crim e than
 separ at e a child from the m ot her  and dehum aniz e the 
mother that she should abandon
 your child because she wa
nted to live.  When we 
were st anding t her e I  was cr yi
ng so hard that people ca
me around me
 and my aunt 
came and she said ﬁWhere 
is my sister, where is 
Sonya?ﬂ and we were beside 
ours elv es .   She was sent 
to the right and she looked 
older then, but it was her 
destiny...they put us...they took
 us to the railro
ad station.  They
 put us in cattle 
trains.  Those cattle trains
 were packed so
 much that we didn™
t hav e a pla ce wher e 
to sit down.  We were
 just standing up and 
in the middle of this  cattle train was a 
very big tub with the disinfec
tant and this was 
our toilet.  We we
re just standing up 
and sometimes people
 were without wa
ter for a couple of
 days, no wate
r, no bread; 
people were just falling like flie
s.  One day, in the middle 
of the night, after this  lon g  
voyage, we would, someti
mes we looked, yo
u know, through a 
opening, and we 
were just s o c ountry s i de.  W e dr ov e t o 
a plac e, t h e m us i c wa
s play ing, t he dog s  
were barkin g, there were Gestapo there, yo
u know the Gestapo wi
th their hats, yo u 
know with there emblems and 
with their rifles and with
 t hos e big dog s and they  
said, ﬁOut! Out! Out!ﬂ  And, music was pl
ay ing and v er y big ref l ec tors, t h ere wa s  
light, t w as. . . and t h ey t o ld again t o line up
 and t h er e was electr ic f enc es around us  
and t h ey t o ok us ins ide and again lined up.  
 And this was the first time that  I saw a 
defaced woman.  This
 woman is something
...I have to describe 
it for you...most of 
them would buxomy young wo men with blon
d hair wit h v er y t i ght unif orm s , wit h  
very long boots and all of 
them had horse hooks
( ph)   and t h ey  us ed them,  thy were  
ver y str o ng with very str
ong v o ic es and if t hey s a w 
a young Jewish gir l that was  
blond, she was their victim be
cause a Jewe ss girl wa s no
t suppose to look like an 

Aryan.  Near me was standi
ng a beautiful young woman,
 she was much older than 
me but she wa s a real beauty
 with blue eyes and blond
 hair and despite that she 
came from the ghetto, som ehow she was outstanding.  
And they were beating her 
for no r e as on.  You k now wh
en you stand there, you we
re not a person, you didn™t 
have a name, you just had a 
number and then they told us
 to line up and to disrobe 
and nak ed we wer e t a ken t o a ver y big pl
ace.   The only t h ing r em ar kable about  this  
very big place, it wa s that
 it  had like showerheads on 
top and s i nc e we h ear d about  
gassing, me and my 
sister and my aunt, we
 were prepared that 
they took us to a 
gas chamber.  So I wa
s standing all naked by this litt le shower head 
and I was, we 
were saying goodby and I wa
s begging God for one thing
...I should be the first one 
should fall because I couldn™t see with my
 aunt and my sister
, ___________, so I 
was t h er e really pr ay ing the f ir st  tim e in 
m y lif e wit h t he way I c ould a nd I said,  
ﬁMomm a, help m e, I want to be t h e f irst one.ﬂ  
 For an eternity, th
ey c l os ed th e d oor,  
for an eternity; we  though
t...some people became 
hysterical, mothers were kissing 
their daughter, they were sayi
ng goodby, people were
 fainting; then 
all of a sudden, 
water started to come out, it 
was not gas, t h ey put us t o  
was h up and c lot hes and it  
was like water of life! 
 We were dr inking, 
we were washing.  
They didn™t give us 
soap, I don™t think they had soap, but we™r
e jus t  was hing and dr
ink i ng th is wa ter a nd  
this was like a miracl
e.  And again they to
ld us to line up and again we were...they 
told  us to dress and we we
re taken to Germ an doct ors 
and then they 
exam ining us  
and then telling us, asking 
us if we have so
me gold hidden.  A lo
t of girls were  
victim s, I was a victim, my si
ster, my cousin, th
ey were so rough, 
looking for gold. 
Any how t h ey  f inally t o ok  us  to bound( ph
) and t h ey  put  on t h
e bounds and I thin k 
they gave us something to 
eat, I don™t remember
 exactly but we 
were so exhausted 
and so emotionally dr
ained from this experience that
 we came aliv e from this  
___________ gas cham
ber, we were jus
t, feel asleep.  I 
was, this was 
___________ of our concentra
tion camp.  It 
was located near
  ___________.  I 
was t h er e not, lik e ly not a long t i me be
cause it  was a place 
wh ere you didn™t do, 
they s t ar v e d y o u to deat h; ther e were s o
me women as signed t o 
c heck t h e c l ot hes,  
to sort out the clothes,
 to...I forgot to tell yo
u, they also, before 
they took us to the  
doctor, they shaved our head
 and they gave us some ki
nd of clothes, not those 
worn uniform but same, some 
k i
nd of c l ot hes .   And one 
day, ev er y day, t h ey wok e 
us up and we had to say 
to our  ______
_____and also we had lik
e a dog tags.  We 
had a num ber, s o we 
had t o ans w er t o th
e number.  F our o™c l
ock in the m or n ing,  
thr ee o™c l oc k in t h e m or ning,
 they used to co
unt us, they always
 us e t o c ount us  
and then we not ic e t hat a lot  of people 
became so desperat
e that they throw 
thems e lf on this electr ic wire and t hey was  
just burned there.  T
hey use to clean up 
the dead bodies.  And one day, they ca
m e and they  said they ar e look ing for  
people and we had to go again 
for the selection, and agai
n I told my sister to 
straight out  hers elf and m e and my s i ster
, my aunt, and the two 
cousins were ver y  
lucky day,  they t o ok us t o  this 
labor c am p  called Denawer dk ee(ph) .  

Denawerdkee(ph) was a cr azy government place ru
n by the   ___________ 
organization and they 
were building t h ere  and we wor k
ed als o v er y hard t h er e, but  
in comparison to  _______
____ or comparis on to ghetto,
 we were in
 paradise 
bec aus e f ir st of all, we 
had hot water to wa
s h, t he f o od was m u ch better and we 
had better condition...
better...even we worked very ha
rd...early in the mornin g we 
had to line up and they were
 again counting us and also 
there we used to unload 
those big chunks of coal, we us
ed to haul in  the 
potatoes, and we  us
ed to work very 
hard but it was m u ch
 better for us there.
 
Q: I f or got  to as k one quest ion.  What  
was the relationship
 between the women 
there? Was  ther e a s e ns e of 
solidarity or was it, did you 
tend to stick together in 
family and frie
nds  ___________?
 
A: We use to stic k together
.  A lot of friendship used 
to f orm  that ev en t o day ™s  
sur v iv or s, t hat bec aus e t h ey wer e in t h
e s a me r o om, in t h e s am e concentr at io n 
camp: they were in the same truck, they 
ar e lif e- long f r iends bec aus e of a lot of  
surviv ors don™t have 
families, they say that she is 
my step-sister, she is my 
___________ sister, she is
 my ghetto sister; so
 a lot of friendship,
 we used to help 
eac h ot her a lot .   T h er e were no f i ght , on 
the contrary, there was 
a lot of solidarity, 
lik e my aunt bec am e  lik e the tent mot h
er and s h e us ed t o tak e car e of us ,  you 
know, and sometime if  she 
could, she would give a pi
ece of bread to us because 
she said ﬁI am old, I don™t ne
ed so much food.ﬂ  So we 
used to stick a lot together, 
there was a lot of s o lidar it
y.  I was later separ at e d 
from my aunt and my two 
cousins and I  was j ust  
wit h my s i ster,  but  I t h ink a v ery
 im port ant f act or
 in this, our 
sur v ival, was because I  was wi
th my sister; becau
se when my father
 used to say as 
a litt le gir l, ﬁ Y ou hav e t o t ak e c ar e  of y o ur 
sister.ﬂ  I took it very seriously and I was 
afr a id t o die that, what w
ould happen to my sister.  So
 this was a very im portant 
factor.  
 
Q: One more question, 
before we 
 ___________
 
A: Sure . Su re.
 
Q: Was it difficult to
 comm unicate som et im es,  or  
did you all speak Polis h  or  
Rus s ian or what  did y o u s p eak ?
 
A: You s e e,  when I c a me to ghett o, I lear
ned Yiddish, I learned 
it and I m et t h er e a 
lot of people that in normal
 times, even they were Je
ws, I would never come in 
cont act wit h them; s o it was lik e a v ery bi
g cultural revelation 
for me and 
a very big 
teaching, said what very bi
g teaching that, so
 I  s pok e fluent Yi
ddish and I spoke 
fluent, of c o urs e, Polis h .  We didn™t  us e 
t oo m uc h Russ ian but 
those two languages 
were pr ev alent, like wit h my 
aunt and m y two c ous ins, my 
sister we spoke Polish. 

But with other people, we s
poke Yiddish, we spoke Jewi
sh, so this wa s the two 
languages that
 we used.
 
[End of Si de A,  Tape 2]
 
So her e we ar e in Dinawark e e( ph) .  Als o in
 Dinawar kee( p h) we met a lot of peo p le

people from Holland were very
 nice to us and sometimes 
when we were 
used to do 
little things for

ed a very big friendship 
with them.  We were 
like six girls together; and this
 poet es s was wr it ing poetry .  
When after I was liberated, I

that the German army start
ed to loose and after working 
in this labo
r camp, we 
were put into a deat h marc
h; I ™m calling it a deat h m a
rc h becaus e for t wo m o nt h s  
we wer e walk ing thr o ugh t h e Polis h coun
try land, it was Janua
ry and F ebr uary i n  
1945, and it was a 
ver y big chaos, we us e t o 
s ee people,  inmates f r om a 
conc entr at ion cam p going in
 one dir e ct ion and t h en we 
wer e going in a diff erent 
direction.  It was just a 
very, very hard time
 because people y
ounger girls were 
falling in t h e s now and just nev e r gett i ng
 up.  You had to be 
always in the front 
bec aus e if you wer e in t h e bac k you wer e
 s hot; and aft er walk ing t w o m o nths,  o n  
March 10, we we re walk ing 
a whole day and a whole night and then in the mornin g 
on M ar ch 11, we wer e tak en 
in a v ery big barn; and we
 were so ex
hausted, we 
were already contacted 
typhus, that we  really
 didn™t care.  In this
 very big barn, we 
meet other people th
at were also coming 
from all over; and as 
I was sitting there, I 
was so exhaust ed t h at  I really felt  that m y
 end is near and I j u
st really didn™t car e  
and as I lo oked down through
 a little opening, I saw the 
assess(ph) people putting 
piles of wood ar ound t he bar n
 an d we  wer e t o ld,  n ot we 
were told, bu
t there was a 
rumor going that we 
will be burned alive be
cause the guards di
dn™t know what to 
do, the Rus sians wer e adv anc i
ng and t h ey didn™t k now what
 to do with us
 in mat e o f  
concentration camp
.  We were sitting, 
and we were so
 exhausted that we really 
didn™t care what they were
 doing, and then we
 had the very big commotion and we 
hear d shot  and we heard dog bark ing 
and hor s es and then a man st art e d t o 
scr eam, ﬁW e ar e fr ee, we ar e fr ee, the Ru
s s i an ar e c om i ng. ﬂ  I ca
ll this day March 
11, 1945, my day of t r ium ph 
because we triumphed
 in a very small way by simply 
surviv ing.  We were so sick that after th
e big bar n, the gat es of the big bar n, aft er  
they wer e open, people burst out  and st art e d 
to r un, but we were
 s o weak t hat  we 
couldn™t ev en r u n and on t o p of ever yt hing, 
there was wet snow ar
ound and I didn™t 
ha ve shoe s.  So as I was st
anding there and my s i ster 
put a piece of the cardboard 
under me, and we 
were six friends by th
is time, we didn™t know
 what todo.  Russian 
soldiers j u mped fr om a tank , a Rus s ian t ank , 
run t o a  lying ass e
s s(ph) guar d, took 
off his shoes, and 
the assess(ph) guard had very
 good shoes, put them on and 
gav e m e his s h oes.  So his 
boo
t s were my savior because,
 if my, by this time my 
toes we re already black and my legs 
were all covered up
 with open wounds 
because they we re froze bea
ten.  Luckily  we
 found a wo man th
at was a Hungarian 
doctor, and I don™t wh ere, bu
t she found a Red Cr oss b
and and those six girl and 

her, we k i nd of stuck  toget
her and we went  ov er, t h er
e was a factory, the place 
where we  were liberated is  ca
lled Kr umall( ph), th
is is in east Russia; and it was a 
milk fact ory ,  and t h ey t ook us
 in...we went to th
is m ilk f a ctor y, ac
tually we crawled  
because we were so exhaus
ted and wh at we saw there,
 I don™t want to see it  
anym or e in my lif e becaus e
 hungry people were drinki
ng the c r eme and t he milk  
and vom it i ng and j us t  ly ing down and being
 so sick that they couldn™t even lift a 
finger, and there were a lot of dead people 
that were ly ing ther
e.  And we  stayed 
there t hr ough the night and in t he mor n
ing s he s om ehow f o und a hors e and buggy  
and she heard that there was 
a Russian field hosp ital, they will take
 the survivors in, 
so we wer e  dec i ded t o go ther e.  
 
On the wa y, we saw so many
 Russian soldiers 
and we were young gi
rls so it  was a 
very dangerous, dan
gerous way for us to
 travel.  One of the Russian came and 
took away our horse and gave
 us another horse and then 
on the wa y to the hospit al 
we went to a empty 
house and we slept th
ere.   I n t he m i ddle of t h e night th e 
Russian soldiers came and 
said that they ar
e...they hear
d that they
 are ver y  
nice...was looking girls slee
ping here and they wanted
 to come in there and we  
start e d to s cream and yell and
 luckily this time, 
I knew very well Ru
ssian; so I went  
to this doctor, in the midd
le of the night, to the co
mm ander  of t h e Rus s i ans  and I 
explained to him that we ar
e all full of typhoid and we
 are going to the Russia n 
hos p ital, s o  luc kily he put a guar d and no
 Russian soldiers came to distur b us 
because unfortunately a lot of
 surviv ors were ra
pped by those soldie
rs.  This is on e 
of the tragedies of the war.  
Finally, when we arrived to th
is hospit al that was a field 
hospital and we were put 
in this  room, and both me an
d my sister contracted 
typhoid; and I was the one t
hat had it  in the worst wa
y and the whole time wh en I 
was having my nightm
ares, I was asking 
for the black grapes
 that I was reading 
about just before
 the German came
.  And people just were dy
ing, young girls were 
just dying, lying like flies. 
 One of the young girls that 
wa s ly ing near me, just befor e  
she died, she was from Leebo
ugh( ph) in t he Rigor( p h) an
d she as ked m e if I woul d 
ev er f i nd, her nam e was Leah, if
 I  ev er f i nd her brot her and 
I should tell her that sh e 
said goodby to him.  My si
st er r ec ov er e d s ooner and she k i nd of  took over t he r o ll 
now of t he oldest s i st er and she took car e
 of m e and she as ked to work in the 
hos p ital kit chen s o s he could s t ay wit h
 me.  Wit h me was 
a ver y, very slow 
recovery.  I wa s physically very sick but 
I was als o ment ally dev ast at ed and aft e r a 
long, long time th
ey put on a train and t
hey send us  to Soapat( p
h), it  is  a t o wn  n ea r  
the Balt ic Sea, and they op
ened t he sanat or i um ther e, a 
lot of people from Polan d  
us e t o go t here bec ause t h ey
 us e to bat h e the Balt ic Se
a.  And when we c am e t o  
this big house,  ther e wer e 
many girls there, 
but I was the worse 
ther e, I was  s p en d 
my days just lying 
there and lookin
g to the ceiling.  Ther
e was no way that I 
had...that I wanted to live. 
 And the doctors to
ld my sister that I am very, ver y  
depressed and I  had another pr
oblem--t hat my toes were so black t h at t hey wanted 

to cut my toes off, then I wo
uld be like an invalid and my 
sist er said that, ﬁMy sist er  
is  not herself, she doesn™t gi
ve you permission to
 do it,ﬂ and s
he begged them and 
luckily they didn™t 
cut my toes off.  
 
One day m y s ist er was c alled t o the doct or 
that was in charge, 
they said that I™m 
gett ing wor se and wor se, s omething dr ast ic 
has t o be done.  So m y s i ster  dr ess e d  
me and took me by fo
r ce down t o  the dining ar ea.  
As I was going t he st eps, t he 
first thing that I saw was a 
piano, it  was a very big gr
and piano and something just 
took me t o  the piano and I s at down and I 
start e d to play.  I was play ing by ear 
without notes and when I sat at  the piano,  
it was like all the years moved away and 
I was again this little
 happy girl, school girl, and I star
ted to play and 
the girls came 
ov er and we wer e singing; and s o met h ing ha
ppened t o me, I wok e 
up.  It was like a 
shoc k t her apy and I started 
to get better and better and 
better and t here wer e, ov er  
there, gar d ens wit h f ull wi
t h fr uit at t h is t im e , bec a us e I  rem em ber  it was s u mmer  
and we us e t o go and eat t h is fr es h fr uit; 
and I st art ed to c om p os e my s e lf.  I  st il l 
looked terr ible, first of all,
 bec aus e of t y phoid t h ey  c ut 
our hair  again,  and I didn™t  
gain too much we ight but 
at least there was...everyday
 I use to come down and 
play the piano.
 
Q: How were you treated, or
 how was the atmosphere 
in the Russian hospital?
 
A: In the Russian hospital, 
t h er e was one nurse m ay b e f or 
60 or 70 ____
__.  I don™t  
thin k they gave us medicine.  I remember 
we were very very thir st y and we use to 
beg t hem f or wat er but they nev er  gave us 
water, but considerin g that we had clean 
bedding and we could wa
sh ourself later, a
nd my sister used to
 come and wa sh me 
and t h ings lik e t h is;  s o they did a v ery, 
very good deed fo
r  us bec a us e act u ally t hey  
saved us.
 
Q: And at t h is point y o u are on ______
__ and y o ur c o us ins wer e not wit h y ou?
 
A: No, the last time that 
I m eet t h em was in St udhoff 
(ph) because in Studhoff(ph), 
they took us...me and my sist
er out...and we went to work
ed at the labor camp an d 
they were in Studhoff (ph).  
It was a very short time befo
re the typhoid epidemic in 
_____.  Du ring this epidemic, 
my aunt Esther passed 
away and my cousin, her 
name was also L
ila, we use to call...becaus
e she was named aft er  m y  
grandmother...tha
t was also the mother 
of her mother, 
so she was the 
big Lila and I 
was the little Lila; and
 she, she...I recall...a
nd she was with her si
ster-in-law, but she 
never recovered completely and she passed 
away v er y short l y aft er  the liber at i on.
 
Q: So how long did you stay
 at the Russian hospital?
 
A: I cannot exactly tell you the time, becaus
e this is something 
that, I was so sick 
that I don™t remember; but I can only tell yo
u that I was liberated
 March 11, 1945.  It 
took m e a whole y e ar till, fr om the hos pital 
t ill the support (ph), t i
ll I was given the so-

called clean bill of health and I was...be
cause Vienna wa s then under the Russia n  
and I was... a Russ ian c it iz e
n: t h ey gav e m e papers t o
 go back to Vienna.  
 
Q: You wanted to go
 back to Vienna?
 
A: I wanted to go back to 
Vienna, because the last time
 when I saw my father, was 
in Kaiser______ (sp) 
concentration camp and
 he was c am e wit h t h e tr ans port from  
Estonia(ph) and he was going 
around and asking for his 
little daughte
rs; and I was  
at t im e in Dinawar kee( ph),
 so when somebody came, th
ere is a Mr. Margules who 
is  looking for his little daugh
ters, so when I heard about it
, they use to send us to 
Kais er ___( ph) to have our t eeths pulled, s o 
I thought that, said 
that, I have a tooth 
ac he.  And I went ther e and I  
saw my father, in 
t he barr acks , ther e(
ph).  Whenever I  
remember my fat h er, I  was always seei
ng him a vigorous 
young handsome man, 
so when I saw my father, 
there was somebody standing
 ther e but  it was not  my 
fat her and I  rec o gniz e him by 
his voice and by his eyes.  So
 I risk my life and I went  
to t h e m en™s bar rack.   But 
because at this time, I wa
s dr es sed lik e a m a n with a 
jacket and pants, so 
they didn™t recognize me, and sinc
e I didn™t have 
hair anyway, I 
looked like a li ttle boy, y
oung boy, anyhow; and I found 
him there.  Of course, he 
em brac ed me and as ked m e wher e is my littl
e s is t er ?  And t h is was t h e tim e  that  
my little sister ha
d rheumatic fever, wa
s in Dinawar kee( ph) in t h e cr ank eov ere( ph)  
and y o u c ouldn™t be sick, but there are c ert
ain t h ings in lif e that ar e just  in 
explainable.  The doctor, the 
assess(ph) doctor that wa s ta
king of the people in the 
crankeover e( ph) had a daught er t hat was t he 
same age as my sister and as I told 
you, my sister was a very pr
etty little girl, 
and he felt sorr y 
for her because she 
looked like his daughter a lot, 
so he used to ta
ke out medicine fr
om the assessment 
and give it  to her and he didn
™t tell nobody that
 he wa s keeping, 
he kept her for a 
couple months; otherwis e she 
would be sent ba
ck to the concen
tration camp and 
she would nev er c om e back.  
So when my father
 asked me, how is  
my sister, I told 
him, ﬁShe is alright.ﬂ
  So he says to me, come tomorr
ow and I want to
 see her; and 
he said to me, like this, w
hen we will survive, 
we have to co
me to Sole(ph) to the 
pharmacy.  I don™t you anything
, just two things, first, take
 car e of your s i st er and 
second, r e mem ber  who y o u are and br ing me
 a good name back.
  So this stayed 
with me for the whole,  whole time.  Next  th
ere when I went, he wa
s n ™t ther e alr e ady;  
and my sister of course wa
s very sick so she couldn™t...
but he never 
knew it; and 
this was the last  time that I saw my fat
her.   But W H EN I was  s e nt fr om Soapert (ph)  
to Vienna, I was v ery anxi
ous to go and see bec a us e wh
en, after  the liber at ion ,  
when we got to li
ttle Beartta(ph) we were
 look ing for the f am i ly. 
 We were two little 
young gir ls,  all alone, wit h 
shaved hair, very sli
m, with
 no m oney and no f am i ly.  So 
the first thin g we were
 looking for our 
father.  We ne
ver heard about hi
m.  We wrote 
letters, we were, t
here were all kinds of organization
s, we never heard about him; 
BUT, on our way to Vienna,
 we wer e t r av eling by  tr
ains and it was a very 
dangerous situation because 
there wa s, there wa
s actually no la ws, and two girls 

were v ery,  ver y easy pr ey t o any body, but
 we had, how you say 
this rupsack(ph), 
yeh?, on our bed, 
and you wh at we™re having, black 
bread, dr y br ea
d, because we 
said when we have bread,
 we don™t need anything else. 
 So people had stockings, 
people had dresses, we had 
two those things 
on our bed with 
bread; and th en 
when we stopped on
 the statio n we
 use to take a li
ttle water and th
is was what we 
at e.  And when we c am e to Lougue( ph)
, we met a lot of Jewis h people and w e  
start e d t o t a lk and ov er ther
e, also, we met a 
girl from Vienna--s
he wa s older than 
us-- and we bec am e  lik e a tr io
.  And she was a very smar
t girl, very 
edu cat ed,  s he 
was a universit y student stud
y i ng medic ine and s h e was 
one of t he st udent s that  
didn™t want to stand
...sit, on the left it was standing
 up.  Much more
 experience that 
me and m y  sist er.  So she 
was t a lk ing to people and she 
was told that ther e is a 
border under _________ we 
were book(ph) and if it  pa
ss the border it will be 
Russia...If we come to Ru ss
ia, we will never co
me back.  And as
 we were standing 
there and t a lk ing to people a 
girl, that was together with
 us at c o nc entrat ion c am p,  
pass by and she reco
gnize us; and s
he says to me ﬁWhat ar
e you doing there?ﬂ  So 
we s a id t o her, ﬁW e ar e goin
g bac k to Vienna.ﬂ  She said
, ﬁDon™t go back.ﬂ  But you 
see,  she says, ﬁYou cous in
™s wife is her in Lougue(ph)
; s he is  in her br ot her™s  
house.  Why don™t you go ther
e and sleep ov er ?ﬂ  So we 
all,  so she took my older 
friend bec a us e s h e had als o 
a hous e, and m e and my s i st
er, w went to my cousin-
in-law, you know (chuckle), and
 she of cour se, s he never  ex
pected that 
we will liv e  
and she never expected to se
e us  and s p ent a lot of t im e
 toget her bec aus e was a t  
conc entr at ion c am p and in Dinawark e e( ph) ; 
so she treated us ve
ry nice, she gave 
us a bed, she gave 
us food, we sleep; and in 
the morning she had a conference 
wit h her br ot her.. .W hat to do wit h us ? 
 So they  decided t
hat  in Lougue( p h)  on 
Sahoniya(ph) 20, there wa s ki bbutz(ph) and they
 were collecting all this orphans 
and they was planning to educ ate them and send them to
 Israel.  So
 the next day 
we went there to the _____
___ 20.  When we came th
ere...you want to ask me 
som et h ing?
 
Q: Do y o u know who 
or ganiz e d t hes e...
 
A: When I was in Vi
enna, there were all kinds of 
Z i onist or ganization and Labor  
organization and this kibbu
tz(ph) in Vienna, or in 
Lourge(ph) on Sahonia(ph) 20 
was or ganized by  a Z i onist or g
anization.  It was 
called Hanor-Hatti(
ph).  They were  
an or ganiz at ion t h at was a c entrist(ph) 
Z i onist or ganiz at i on
; and their job was 
collect t h e or phans t h at s ur viv ed, educat
e them and smuggle th
em, literally,  to 
Israel bec a us e t h er e was  no way t hat  t h
e Jews were permitte
d,  (c huck le)  t hos e 
who s urv iv ed, wer e permitt ed t o
 go their own 
land Israel.  
 
When we c am e ther e,  the next 
mor n ing, and they took us 
t her e,  so of cour se... it  
was a very big problem with 
me because I was lo
oking like the walk
ing dead.  I was 
very skinny , very sick an d when they sa
w m e t h ere,  t he man t h at int erv iewed m e  

was afraid that I will 
die any moment and they
 didn™t want to have 
this traumatize all 
the young people there.  And then, so he 
sat me down, he started to ask me from 
wher e I am?  I told him that I am from
 Vienna and he star
ted me, and what a 
coincidence in 
lif e!  She was a boyfr i end of the s ist
er of  the poet es s 
that wrot e this  
poem t h at I  just s ang!  He
, t he s ist ers nam e was T as h a.

Q: Interview with Lily Mazu
r(ph) Margules, conducted 
by __________ 
on August 
27, 1996 at Lily 's home in
 t he Br o n x , Ne w Y or k
.  This is tape three, side A.
 
A: W hen he hear d that I was 
together with them and he 
st art ed t o ask  
me questions 
and I t o ld him how we were 
together and I told
 him t hat we wer e ver y c l os e and I  
told him t h at s he wr ot e, s he wr ot e t h e poem
s.  He felt very sorry for me and he 
ac cept ed m e.  And for thr ee or f our mont
hs, I was, ot her child
r en had to work , ha d 
to do some things in
 order to support themselv es, a
nd he let me j ust stay in be d 
and j us t  lik e a c o nv alesc e.  And v ery s hor
tly aft er war d, I  star ted t o com p os e m ys e lf  
and I st art ed t o j ust t o give lect ur e to 
other children.  Like I was talking abo u t 
geography, I was talk in
g about histories, so I was tryi
ng, in my own 
way, to be a 
little usefuls because, after 
all, ot her childr en wer e wor k
ing and I, a y o ungster, we re 
work ing and I not.  And aft er 
awhile, I became like a cu
ltural co-dir ector and the 
thing is only me and my s ist
er wer e from Vienna.  All 
other children and youngsters 
there wer e from Poland, but t hey ac cept
ed us and t h ey,  we bec am e go od fr iend s  
and t h er e was no differ enc e. 
 W e did (br e ak in t ape).
 
Q: So, y o u bec am e, almost lik e a cult ur
al coordinator or
 leader in the...
 
A: Yeah, yes, and I was very
 happy about it  because this
 way I felt  useful because 
not only wanted, they 
us, to give us shelte
r, but they wanted us
 to be educated and 
they k now that our educ at i
on and ev ery litt le of k no
wledge, but t here wer e ot her  
people that we re teaching us
, also.  And then one day, 
there were orders that we 
are on our way to Israel.  It wa
s, it was, it  had to be ill
egal.  Be cause we didn't have 
papers.  So it was organize
d t h at we had t o wander fr
om one c o un try t o anot her .  
So from Lodz, we went t o Cz ec hos l ov ak ia
,  from Poland int o Cz ec hos l ov akia.  I n  
Cz echoslo vakia we were just a very short 
time and then they to
ok us with trucks, 
always wit h tr uc ks, and alway s there we
r e  young Jewis h boys that c am e from  
Israel that were helping us
 organize it.  And 
then we came, we  
came to the DP 
cam p s of G erm any, wher e they put us in 
Munich, we stayed th
ere a few days in a  
very big place and
 then they send 
us to a very big farm that
 wa s taken away from a 
Nazi.  An d they organized an 
agricult ural school there be
cause they wanted us to 
know how to work the 
land.  So we we
re there in this very 
big farmhouse.  There 
was separ a te dor mitor i es f or t h e gir ls ,  a s e
parate dormit ory for 
t he boy s.  W e wer e  
just superv ised by one per s on and ther e 
was  nev er any pr egna
ncy, never anything 
fooling ar ound.  Nev e r, on t h e, nev er an
ything, you know, on 
the contrary, there 
were one, one weekend t h er
e were six marriages.  Ev er
ybody wa s lonely.  And we 
taught how to milk the cows, 
how to fish, how to work  in 
t he gar d en,  how to wor k in 
the fields.  And they 
had a very big pond full of fish, 
so when we ha
d this weddin g 
for the six couples, we
 took the fish
 out and it  was, it 
wa s a very relaxing 
atm os p her e.  And all of us
 that were look ing lik e 
__________, very
 big compos e 

__________ and they beca
me different people, but let me 
just tell you one thin g. 
The people around us are very
 much against us and ever
y night there were a bo y 
and girl walking around and guarding.  An
d we also had guard 
dogs because they 
couldn't stand it that ther
e wa s youngsters that surviv ed
 and they we
r e,  that  ar e 
looking every day better. 
 And so we were
, our lives were 
always in danger.
 
Q: What was the age r ange 
of the youn
g companions?
 
A: Most of the people were 17
, 18, 19, I think, I would sa
y the oldest on
e must hav e  
been in the 20's, but in t
heir appearances, they 
always, they all 
lo oked like 11, 12 
year old c h ildren.  It took a 
long time, especially
 on the f arm, it 
was easier becaus e  
the fr es h air and t he fr es h eggs and the f r
esh food that we we
re very hungry,  you 
know.  I remember  that from  time to time, th
ey used to take
 us to the, to doct or s.  
And the first time when they
 took me to the doctor, th
ey put me under a fluoroscope 
and the doctor asked his 
assistant, "Is this a boy or a gi
rl?"  This  is  how I looked. 
Bec a us e I had t y phoid and t h en I had pleur
isia( p h) and t hen I 
had TB and
 then I 
had dev e loped a heart murm
ur and t h en I  had, m y, as
 I spoke before, I ha d 
pr oblem wit h m y legs, so I wa
s j u st in such a ba
d s h ape, that it was  a m ir a cle t ha t  I  
com p os e m ys e lf and I ' m here today.
 
Q: Your sister was in 
a little better shape?
 
A:  My sister was in a litt
le better shape bec
ause somehow she reco
vered, even she  
had rheumatoid fe
ver when she was a li
ttle girl and she wa
s in __________.  She 
had the lighter form of typhoid 
and she didn't have compli
cations.  With me, I ha d 
one complication after an
other.  She still didn't look 
her age, she st
ill didn't have her 
height, but somehow she was 
not so sick like me.  
 
Q: Did you talk about yo
ur experiences there?
 
A: Never.  Never.  That's completely  bl
ocked out.  We didn't ta
lk.  We only talk ed 
about that we'd like to 
find our parents, we'd
 like to find our  fa
mily.  A lot of boys  
and girls, at a very young 
age, married because they we
re lonely.  
Loneliness and 
loneliness, this was, this wa
s the whole t h ing.  And also,  
we talk ed about t he f ut ur e .  
We, a ll of u s fe lt t ha t  we 
wer e per secuted becaus
e we didn't hav e a,
 we didn't hav e  
a, our  own land.  If we woul
d hav e our  own land wit h 
our own embassy, with our 
own polit ic al, we would never be persecut
ed for no r e as on.  Bec
ause, and a lot of  
people felt  that if  they wo
uld have blue eyes and blon
d hair, they would, could 
sur v iv e lik e  Ary a ns, y o u k now.  So ther e wa
s a lot of, of looki
ng t o ward the f u tur e  
and a lot of friendship and loneliness 
and a lot of wanted
 to find somebody.
 
Q: So you were in Czechoslov
akia and t h e k i bbut z, r i ght ?
 
A: Together with 
the kibbutz, yeah.
 

Q: And how long did you stay
 ther e and wher e did y ou go?
 
A: No, from Czechoslo vakia we
 were just spendi
ng a very short 
time, a few days, 
may b e a week.  And from ther e, t hey br oug ht us to M unic h, and then fr om Munic h  
they brought us to, the farm 
was Fiersbach(ph) by Mosen(
ph).  An d then we stayed 
and we c o mpos ed ourself.  An
d then, aft er F ier s bac h by 
M os e n, they put us  in a 
DP camp.  The name of th
e DP camp wa s Leipheim(ph). 
 An d this  DP camp, we 
stay ed t her e, I don't r em ember exact ly ho
w lon g, but it  wa s 
Christmas night, no, 
Christmas night, that  
we were crossing 
the Alps on our wa y to 
Italy.  And it must 
have been already 
in, I would say, 
beginning of '47.
 
Q: Before we go on to the next country,  wh
at was  the sit u at ion in the DP camps ?  
Wer e y o u t oget h er wit h non- Jewish pers ons ?
 
A: No, no, ever, all the, 
the DP camp displa ced peopl
e came, they were only 
Jewish survivors there, there was the UNRA(p
h), that was helping there.  We ha d 
supervision by the doctors and
 also, we had rations, yo
u k now, y o u k now.  And it ,  
we were, we felt
 very disappointed be
c a us e we didn't  want it
 to be char it y.  We 
didn't want charit y cases, we 
didn't want  to be s upport e
d by s omebody, we wa nt t o  
be self, self-substaining, we
 wa nted to go to school, we
 wa nted to learn some, a 
pr ofess i on or som et h ing, hand
, you know, things like this. 
 So we were 
ver y, but  we 
were told that this is just 
a tr ans it i on, that we ar e on our
 way to Israel, 
that we were  
going to Italy and wh
en we, when we come to Italy, 
we will board a boat and it will 
tak e us to our pr om is ed land.  You k n ow
, many times we were taken to movies, 
they were t r ying t o make our 
lif e as pleas ant as poss ible, 
but it, we lost a lot of self-
est e em and als o, t he st igm a t o being a 
displa ced person to 
any thinking youn g 
person wa s very degredating
, you know.  And 
we didn't ha
ve too much books t o 
read, t h e libr ary, t h ey,  as m uc h as t h ey 
stock ed it t o educ ate us and t h e k i bbutz  
were having all kinds 
of wor ks hops and t h ings lik e t h
is,  but st ill we  we re h un g r y fo r  
knowledge.  So finally, here 
we ar e on Christ mas  night c r
ossing the Alps.  I mean, it 
was a very hard exper i enc e 
and we were crossing as Gr
eek s.  And imagine what a 
coincidence, in the 
same night my hus
band, my future husb
and whom I didn't 
know, was also crossing th
e Alps and going to Italy 
and wanted to emigrate to 
Israel, I didn't k
now him, he didn't kn
ow me.  But before he 
left, he was in Munich 
and bef ore he left  Munic h, 
his sister-in-la w baked him a 
batc h of c ook ies.  And he 
was being generous and 
as we were cros
sing the Alps in the s
now at night, he was 
giving out cookies an
d I at e one of his c o ok ies wit h
out knowing t h is.  W hen I me t  
him, he told me that the night, and I said to
 him, "O h, I at e y our 
cookie".  So finally, 
it  was a very arduou
s journey and, bec
ause of t h e boy s  that  wer e  in k ib b utz ,  were 
helping t he gir ls , we made i
t.  Because we were sliding,
 we were sliding from the 
passages there and finally
 we came to Italy.
 
Q: How did you cros
s?  On foot?
 

A: On foot, we cr ossed on foot in the mi
ddle of t h e night and we cr os sed by f oot  
bec aus e it was not off i cially, 
and we will be
 caught, even we had, 
we were told that 
we are Greeks, you kn
ow, but it was an ope
ration, we were ju
st, we were, thos e 
people, the guides, knew some
 passages, but it was very 
arduous in the middle of 
the winter crossing the Alps.  Anyhow, fi
nally, they brought us
 to Italy and they 
br ought us to a dis p lac ed c a
mp near Milano called Adriat
ic a( ph).  We stay ed ther e 
for awhile and then we we
r e transf err e d to anot her c am p, dis p lac e d camp, near  
Torrino(ph), Turin(ph
), called ________
__.  And we  are sett
led down there, we 
liv e d in barr ac ks and wer e tak i
ng all kinds of cour ses, yo
u know.  But we were still 
in kibbutz.  And then
 one day they took us
 to the movies and I 
was sitting there in 
the mov ies  and, as I  told y o u, the gi
rls from my kibbutz didn't know Russian 
bec aus e they were fr om Poland, only me 
and my s is t er.   So they were showing a 
Russian movie without subtitles, so I was si
tting there and explaini
ng t hem in Polis h  
what wa s going on and behind
 m e was s itt ing a young boy 
with his frie
nd and this 
was m y hus b and, m y fut ur e hus b and. 
 My, Edward Margul
es.  And he was 
fascinated, "Who was the gi
r l who was talk ing Russ ian?"  Bec a us e he k new v ery  
good Russian and he wanted 
to meet, so when
 t h e lights went up, he s a w me and 
in this times I had two 
long, very long hair 
and I still, I think I 
was wearing br a i ds a t  
this t im e, look ing v er y  young.  So he
 found out wh ere I am
 and he as k ed s om e  
guys from, to introd
uc e m e.  And he star ted t o c our
t me.  He was 
in a diff er ent  
kibbutz and I was in  a differ
ent kibbutz.  And 
when he was courting
 me, he started 
to talk to me and 
he found out that I 
like opera, that I like balle
t, that  I like theater, so 
he would take me to the 
city of Milan and he woul
d get to La Sc ala__________, 
and t h is was t h e f irst tim e t hat I saw La
 Sc ala.  T w ic e he t o ok m e, once we s a w 
Sampson and Delilah.
  And then, I saw ano
ther opera, I 
cannot think, I'm a little 
nervous, I cannot think abou
t it now.  And once on ou
r trip, I told him that I'm 
look ing f or my fat h er, so he 
said he heard that in Milano
, t her e is a J e wis h c ent er  
that people, displa ced people, are putting on
 the wall that are 
looking for this, are 
look ing f or this, s o we went ther e bef or e 
the perf orm ance, we cam e a litt le earlier  
and I put t w o notic es.   O ne,  t hat  me and 
m y s i st er ar e look ing f or  my f at h er an d 
then I  had lik e a, I 
think I  remember, I had a visual
 memory, I remembered t hat  
lett ers  us ed to c om e  fr om Ar gent i na and t h
ey were always addr
essed to my father 
and the r et ur n addr es s was like 
an I. Mazur, this I saw.  
So I said, you 
know, I kno w 
that I hav e an unc le in Ar gent ina, so let  me put a not
ic e 
up t hat  I am look ing f or m y  
uncle.  And I didn't remember his first name
, I just put I. Mazur.
  As it happens, my 
young,  my  unc l e was a younger  br other of
 my father, was liv
ing Buenos Aires and 
he was als o look ing for sur v iv
ors of his family.  He wa
s a v ery well- t o- do bus i nes s  
man who had connection
s with Italians that
 lived in M ilano and he wr ot e t o t h es e 
people that he heard th
at there are displac
ed persons, maybe you 
could go to this 
and t h is place.  And this ma
n, t h e Italian guy, went t h er
e and saw on th
e wall that 
two gir ls ar e look ing f or t heir uncle.  
He  telegraphed him 
and one day, I got a 

tele gram in the camp that 
I should come and th
ere on the Garibaldi
(ph) Street and 
that I should come and look
 for this.  When I went 
there he was a very nice 
gentleman, very we ll
-to-do, a very elegant offices an
d he says that my uncle in 
Ar gentina is looking for, an
d he sent him a tele gram and 
he said that we should g o  
to the Argent
ine embassy, and he will help us to make the pa
pers.  At this time, 
Jews wer e not ac c ept ed to c om e t o Ar gent i
na.  So my uncle was 
s o elat ed that he  
found t w o gir ls and that
 wa s, that he we nt to a very
 big attorney and gave him a 
blank check and he said, "I
 want my niec es t o be t ak e n out fr om Eur ope  an d 
brought over here".  And he
 made us papers 
as Episcopalians be
cause my name is 
Leah(ph) on my 
papers and her name is Rachael
(ph), but in the meantime, when 
we we re wa it in g f or t h e pa p ers
, we didn't know, my
 kibbutz had to go
 to Israel.  And 
I went t o t he elder s of the 
kibbutz and I said to him I 
don't know what to do. 
Bec a us e in the m e ant ime I wa
s already establis hed and ev
erybody liked me in the 
kibbutz and I was already havi
ng my position, you know, so he says, I've met this 
guy and he wants to marry me, 
but he doesn't want to join
 the kibbutz.  He has a 
diff erent idea, he was  a diff
erent, but he want
s m e  to st ay wit h him.  W e were  
talk ing back and forth 
and he said to me, "L
ook, I know that y
ou are very 
dedicated 
to the kibbutz, it's ve
ry good, but you have 
to look for yo
urself.  You are alone with 
your sist er".  We didn't k
now about my uncle 
then, and if you 
found a young boy 
that you like, you have to
 __________, you have
 the obligation to you.  Low an d 
behold, there was a big weddi
ng.  There wa s the two kibb
utz's and I had to, I kne w 
my hus b and only  t hree m o nt hs  bec a us e or  I  
marry him.  He said to me, "But you 
hav e to m a rry him, y o u c a nnot j u st st ay 
and be his girlfriend.  
This was not done.", 
he s a ys,  "I  hav e t h e obligat
ion to you, you ha
ve to marry him.  We'll make you a 
ver y big wedding".  And it 
was j us t  a f e w day s bef or e 
t h ey left and went  to G e no a 
for, to board this
 very big boat to go to
 Israel.  But they landed
 in Cypress.  An yhow, 
there was a very big wedding
 made in his ki
bbutz and there were 400 people.  I 
didn't have a dress, my sister
 didn't have a dress, so 
my husband ga
ve us money 
and we went and he bou
ght us the material, ___
_______ and he
 bought us 
underwear and shoes, we had
 nothing.  And imagine the 
present that my kibbutz 
gave me, a very big plant.  I 
didn't have anything, this wa
s a plant.  And t h en fr om, it  
was  a v er y big t h ing that t w o s urv ivor s ar e 
getting m a
rr ied, s o fr om,  you k now,  f r om  
UNRA, from they came a
nd they gave us such presents 
that it is just ridiculous. 
Anyhow...
 
Q: I' d lik e t o ask y ou j ust a f e w quest i on
s befor e we go on.  
Did y ou lear n Italian 
and did you have any contac
t with the population there?
 
A: I learned Italian very fa
st, I didn't have to
o much contact, but 
ev er y Fr id ay we 
used to make some kind o
f, we used to get 
Russians.  And after 
I got married and  
was left in Torrina, in
 __________, in this ca
mp.  An d every, I le
arned how to bake 
a cake.  We had all kinds of
 ingr edients.   And near  t h
is displaced 
persons camp, 

there was a bakery and very
 nice Italia n people.  A
nd they used to give us 
perm is s ion wit h those half 
baked things and put them in
 t he oven.  And we us ed to 
alwa ys admir e them, that they used to si
t down and make a sa
lad and make
 all the 
preparation.  An d 
the Italia n people were very nice a
nd very friendly 
to us.  And we 
used to go out an
d after, I was in Ital
y  for a year,  and I s p
oke Italia n, I could 
befriend myself and I le arned this langua
ge and I was quit e pr
ofic ient in this 
language.  Also, at this
 time, after I got married, my 
husband didn't want to wa it for 
the Russian and we  should,
 the UNRA should support 
us, so he, there was an 
organization called ORT(ph),
 it was a J e wish or ganiz at i
on, t h ey had all k i nds of  
cour ses and one of the cour ses was des
igning and s e wing on a mac h ine.  So he 
went  t her e and he t ook t he c o urs es  and 
he was looking for wo
rk and so
metimes he 
us ed t o be lik e em ploy ed by an It alia
n who had a st or e and 
he needed, 
and also, 
he us ed to,  he bec am e a des i
gner ther e.  Me, I went  
to learn how to wr it e on a 
typewriter and also
 a few, some E
nglis h lessons.  
 
Q: Would you tell us a little
 bit more about yo
ur hus b and?  You 
said at one point  
that he had a different id
ea about kibbutz, wh ere did he 
come from, what was his 
stor y?
 
A: My husband came from 
Poland and he is, 
when the German 
escaped, he come 
from a very  nic e religious 
f am i ly.  And t h ey wer e, they
 wer e four br ot her s and two 
sist ers, ther e were six child
r en.   And from all of t hem
, one brother an
d one sister 
sur v iv e d.  A l l of t he m  pe ri
shed.  His father 
and his mother peri
shed.  His youngest 
sister, he was the youngest fr
om the six,  and th
e sister that was after him was shot 
by __________ on his mother's
 hand when they we
re, they were be
ing sent to the 
cam p s.  He com es fr om a town called Cher it
z(ph), but t he whole, 
his life, he lived in 
Lodz.  When t h e Ger m an cam e  
to Lodz, he told his olde
r brot her that he is not  
staying withGerm an beca
use once, with th
e Germans, becaus
e once he, very 
short l y aft e r they  oc cupied Lodz,  he wa
s work ing on t h e stre
et and he saw two 
soldiers beating up a 
father and a son, Jews
, and he says, "I am
 not going to stay 
here".  So, he pers uaded his br
ot her, his br other had a f i an
c e, s o all t hree of t h em ,  
they came to the house and 
told the parents that they
 are not staying and they 
escaped to Russia.  And he 
was in , there are 
many __________ that
 he has to tell 
them again, anyhow, he surv
ived in Russia.  And when 
he, after the 
war finished, 
they let him to co
me to Poland because he
 was a Polish citizen, so he went to Lodz 
and f o und his f am i ly  and 
he decided that it 's ti
me to go to Israel.  
 
Q: I would like to ask you a 
personal question, you were
 st ill ver y  
young and you 
nev er really had t im e to 
get to know boys
 and become inti
mate in a nice, 
construct ive way.   W as it di
fficult for you to shape a trus
ting, intimate relationship 
with anybody, or wi
th your husband?
 

A: With my, my husb
and was not hard beca
us e he was like m y benefact or, he w a s  
like my savior, he wa
s like my tower of strength.  
And also, he was very friendly t o  
my sister.  So, he, th
ey used to have long
 discussion, and he liked my sister and he 
kind of adopted us.  So
, I had no, I was, w
hen I wa s in kibbutz,
 I had a lot of boys 
that I was friendly with and 
one boy wanted to m arry m e, 
but I didn't like him, so I 
didn't have this kind of problems, you k
now,  but I was nev er a t eenager.  When I  
married my husband, I  was a 
virgin.  I was neve
r a t e enager  and also,  my f at h er  
told m e I hav e t o br ing him a good nam e 
and I knew what he 
meant.  This was a 
good name.  Many years ago,
 ther e wer e gir l s  that y o u 
m arry and t h e gir l s that you 
sleep wit h,  and I was  the one that y ou h
ad to marry.  I promised my father yo u 
marr y, so t h is is, t h is is h ow it wa s.  My 
father, so this is how 
the situation was.  You 
see, the amazing thing with
 this Hebrew __________ kibbu
tz, supervis ed by a fe w 
people, and there were ne
ver any hanky-pank
y, any sleeping ar
ound before the 
marriage.  The moral,  the, we we re not pr
udes, but there was, 
just, I don't know if 
we were doing this
 for our parents or we
 were just br
ought up this  
wa y, b ut t h e 
moral f iber is very st
r ong.  And a boy, m a yb
e he was st ole a k is s, 
it was a big t h ing ,  
you know.
 
Q: Did you have similar idea
s about the future, 
about maybe having
 children or not, 
or what t h e dr eam s and as pir at ions...
 
A: Well, first of all, I was ve
ry det ermined t o go to I sr ael
 and s t art a new lif e.  And I  
was ver y, I was believing t h at 
t his  is where I hav e to go
.   And when I got m arr ied ,  
my husband didn't want to have 
any children.  He said afte
r the war is, the world is 
very hostile to us and he doe
sn't want to, he, to brin g 
up children, they should go 
through what he went through
 and I we nt through
 and my sister we
nt through.  So 
he was very determined
 not to have c h ildr en.   And s o
, when I was in
 the DP camp, 
we didn't talk about it and I 
didn't, I felt it wa
s the right way, I wa
nt ed t o br ing,  if  I  
hav e a c h ild, I want to bring the c h ild in a 
certain style, give him a certain, him or 
her, a c ert ain educat ion, s o 
it  wa s not a discussion.  And 
my sist er was very pr ett y  
and a very popular girl and 
she had many, many boy that
 wanted to marry her.  As 
a matter of fact, the 
day t h at I was m arr ied,  there wa
s a boy t hat had f am ily from 
Belg ium and they sent some
body, they should bring him 
to Be lgium and he said 
that he wanted to 
take her to Belgium.
 
[End of si de A of Tape 3]
 
Q: Interview with Lily Mazur 
Margules on August 
27, 1996.  This is
 tape three, side 
B.
 
A: But, I was so attached to
 her and I said, "How can yo
u go?  You are not married 
and where will you go?"  So, he
 went alone and for the lo
ngest time my
 sister was 
quit e hurt by me, by my dec
ision, but I spoke to my 
husband, we de
cided we  are 

the caretakers of her so s
he was always wit h  us.  And t h
en one day, as I told you,  
the telegram came and we we
nt to t h is m an and, t h is 
Italia n businessman, and a 
ver y s h ort t im e lat er we got t h e v i sa and 
we got the tickets to
 go by boat.  An d we 
went  second class, not, yo
u know, it  was second clas s 
and third class, it  wa s not 
fir st class,  you know,  so we
 went by, and we 
were told that we
 ar e not t o  s p eak  
Polish, we are not to
 speak, we are not to speak Je
wish, we are Epis copalian, we 
ar e, y ou know, Italian and t hat' s all.  My 
unc le s ent us a hundr
ed and twenty dollars 
because this is how much the visa costs a
nd when we went
 to take out the visa, we 
had anot her friend who spok e v ery  good Ita
lian, v ery f l uent, bett er th an we.  And he 
told us we are displaced pe
ople, so why should we pay so
 much money, 
it was a lot 
of m oney, so t h ey gave us t h e vis a gr
at is,  so we had one hundr ed and t w ent y  
dollars.  And this was the onl
y m o ney that we had.  So, 
her e we em bark ed aft e r the 
long voyage, it  was 21 days fr
om Italy to Argentina.  I wa
s, wit h my sister , we were  
very sick because even unt
il today, I don't travel well
 and I had seasickness and 
even in the beginning 
on the plane.  Anyhow
, we arr i ved t o Ar gent ina.  And bef o r e  
we arrived we stopped in  
Uruguay and a friend
 of my uncle ca
me there and he 
went , cam e  on t h e boat 
and just to see 
how we ar e.   And he s a ys , " L ist e n, if  you 
com e t o Ar gent ina", he s a id t o my hus b an
d, "you have to wo rk
.  Your unc l e is a 
very generous man, but remember".  Well, 
of cour se, we took it, we understood, we 
came and my uncle and he 
had, he had a daught er and 
a son and his wife and a 
lot, maybe 30, 40 people came 
to see us.  Often he took 
us and he had a ver y nic e  
big hous e and he had a ver y
 big part y for  us.  And 
when we came
, we were 
dressed like two li
ttle ladies, with hats
, with gloves, and beca
use the little  money 
that my husband made workin
g, he spent everything fo
r our wardrobe
, so he was 
very pleasant surprised.  
Because he saw that we are 
not the wild people that they 
show, you know, from 
the displaced person, 
but we  are two little ladies with goo d 
manners who knew how to ea
t, who knew how to be, 
behave, so he
 was very, 
made us a ver y big par t y.  And f or a 
whole m o nt h, we st
ayed in his house.
 
Q: Did y o u know at all what  to expect
 from yet anot her 
country, Ar gentina?
 
A: No, I, when we were 
going by boat, we met some 
people that were from 
Ar gent ina and t h ey were c o
ming from Italy and they 
wer e s peak ing t o  us i n  
Spanish.  And I said 
to my husband, "Thi
s is a language that 
I will never learn". 
This is I said, "I give up".
  This  is the language I will
 never learn.  Be cause it  
sounded to me so st
range.  But, when we
,  three m onths aft er we, let m e s l o w  
down, three months after we
 stayed in Argentina, 
I bought a Polish/Spanish 
dictionary and I knew how to 
communicate myself.  I starte
d to speak, I used to bu y 
all kinds of  magazines becaus
e t here ar e no public  libr ar
ies in Buenos Air es,  so I  
used to buy magazines a
nd papers and I  lear ned m ys e
lf.  There are no night 
sc hools.  And I had to lear
n because, I had Spanish, beca
us e aft er, I had t o, t o bu y  
things, to c omm unic at e.  Aft er a month, m y
 uncle found us an apartment and he, h e  

was a tremendous help. 
 Also my cousin, one of my 
cousins, was married already 
and his wif e was very,  very nice
 to us.  They really didn't 
know what to 
do with us. 
And my uncle wa s treating us, 
not like, not like a brother's
 children, but like his own 
children.  We found warmth 
and compassion and 
he was very happy
 that he found 
two li ttle ladies, so he, many
 times he used to take us a
nd introduce us to his ver y  
rich fr iends  and he was ver y pr oud of us. 
 With my cousin, the female, we couldn't 

make too much friendship bec
aus e she becam e ver y
 jealous of us, he
r father all of 
a s u dden has t w o m or e daught er s, y ou k now
.  An d he's paying 
so much attent io n 
to us.  So she was just 
tolerating us.  But,
 the generosity 
of m y unc l e is  
unbelievable.  He used to ta
ke me to the ____
______, this is the 
where he used to 
tak e us all ov er.  On t he t h ir d day aft er 
my husband was in Buen
os Aires, he asked 
my unc le t o t ak e him and he
 started to work.  And he
 gave him th
e hundred and 
twenty dollars back.  My un
cle couldn't believe it, what 
kind of people are we? 
Imagine, I was on the 
boat and I wanted to drin k and
 we had to pa
y, my husba nd 
said, "I have no money.  
T h is is y our unc l e' s m oney
".  So, he,  he was very 
im pr es sed wit h my husband.  He made a 
very good im pr es sion
 with him.  An d he 
took us, very s hor t tim e that m y hus b an
d was wor k ing and he 
st art ed t o lear n the 
language and because he
 was a designer, it
 helped him a lot. 
 And a very short 
tim e, aft er work ing and work ing and wor k in
g, he went  int o m anuf act ur ing and he 
opened his own place and was,
 used to wo rk 
very, very, very 
hard.  Fourteen , 
sixteen hours a day.  In Buenos Aires, there 
was a very big prosperi
ty now, it was in 
1948, we came 
to Buenos Aires 
in June, 1948.  It was po
st-war, they needed a lot 
of c l ot hing and he st ar te
d to work fo
r himself.  
 
Q: Do y o u rem ember t he f irst t im e, or one of
 the first times, w
hen you felt a sens e 
of, a r elat i v e s e ns e of may b e nor
malc y or s a fety or peac e again?
 
A: I think when I came to my
 uncle's house and he made 
this  big party.  And I saw 
his kindness, I saw his caring.  I finally felt
 that I have,  that I 
came to a safe plac e 
like the boat, find a place, how you?
 
Q: A harbor?
 
A: A har bor .  I f ound a saf e har bor .  And 
all m y y e ars  in Ar gent
ina, ev er y holiday s ,  
the J e wis h holiday s, t h e high
 holiday s, Pass over, I alway s
 k n ew that  I hav e a plac e 
wher e t o go.  And I alway s k new that I ha
ve a family.  And he was, my uncle was 
very proud of my father an
d was telling us th
ings that we didn
't even know about 
him.  You know?  So this  wa s 
the first time that I felt safe
.  Yes, but, le
t me point out 
to you, it was not a easy decision for me
 and my husband to co
me to Ar gent in a. 
Bec a us e we were v er y 
determined to go to 
Isr ael.  And I wr ot e t o  my unc l e t hat I 
really am apprecia te his conc
ern in Italy, but I would like,
 and he wr ot e to us that ,  
"You come to Ar gentina, you 
must be in very 
poor shape.  You 
go, you find your 
healt h, y ou lear n som et hing and then you 
go to I sr ael".  An
d t h is is how we 

dec i ded, bec a us e we wer e v ery  reluctant t o
, not to go to Isr
ael.  We were very 
determined to go to ou
r own land.  And it felt that 
we  are kind of betraying our 
ideals.  We were very 
idealistic.  We trade 
our ideals and it t o ok  
a long time
, a lot of 
letters, until we de
cided to go to 
and accept his idea.  
It was not easy for us.
 
Q: So y o u bec am e a s t rong s upport er of the Z ionis t  mov em ent ?
 
A: Ve ry strong, very strong s
upport.  I felt that I belonged 
to Israel, that this  is m y  
land and I have 
to live there.  And my
 husband wa s even more.  
 
Q: One last question, you sa
id earlier that in your 
childhood, religio n wa sn't so 
im po rta nt.   Did it b ec o me 
more important over
 time or did you lose, did you lose 
fait h in God because 
of what happened or...
 
A: Many times, when I 
was  in t he ghett o s uff er ing a lot, 
I used to think, "I don't think 
there is  God because if ther
e would be God, something lik
e this wouldn't happen to 
my litt le s ist er and, you know
".  So  I was very d
oubtful that there is
 God.  They were 
very hard times and 
when I was in concent
r at ion c am p,  es pec i ally during t he deat h 
march, when I was really givi
ng up, I really had no desire 
to live.  Once
, during the 
death march, we stopped on a 
very big farm and 
we were so exhauste
d that we fell 
as leep wit h out eat i ng and I 
was  ly ing near my s i ster . 
 And we wer e ly ing ther e 
between this hay and in the 
middle of t he night, I said to
 my s ist er, " Y ou k now what ,  
I'm not going f art her.  My,  
I cannot, my legs don
't  respond to me, 
I cannot go any 
more," I said, "We will
 just stay here in this hay an
d m a ybe the whole colum n  will 
leave us and then we will see, 
we will just die here".  And 
then all of a sudden in the 
mor n ing, t h e German guar d c am e and he 
st art ed t o poke a
nd poke and poke an d 
he f ound us c am o uf laged ther e,  so I f e ll t o
 his  f eet  and I st art e
d to beg him, "Shoot 
me, I don't want to live anym
ore.  I cannot go, I'm too ex
haust ed".  My sist er was 
crying and he said  to me, 
he picked me up
 and he says to 
me, "You stupid, 
Yuda(ph)," he said to me
, __________.  An d he said to
 me, "You have to march 
and y o u have t o go wit h me.  I am  not le
aving you here and I 
am not  shooting y ou  
here".  And he dragged me to the colu mn.  
So ther e wer e a lot de
s p er at ion, a lot of,  
a lot of losing faith and 
a lot of asking wh y. 
 And this, and,
 even when I 
was in  better 
shape, r e ligion was not  ver y im port ant to m e
.  And let me tell 
you, now, many times 
when I speak to the ch
ildren, they ask me all kinds of
 questions and 
just recently 
one of the students
 asked me if  I 
belie ve in God. 
 And when I speak 
to the children I 
tell them the truth, and childr
en are like little anim als, th
ey feel that 
when you are 
telling t hem  the tr ut h, when y o u ar e just t e
lling t h em tall st or ies,
 so I said to him, 
"Look," he was a little
 boy, he said, "After wh at happened
 to you, do you still believe 
in God?"  I said, "Look, I will tell you the 
truth.  There were 
times when I didn't 
believe, but  as of now, 
I don't say that God is a white 
m a n wit h a long bear d, sit s on 
kind of  throne.  But I feel there is a 
higher power and many 
times when I hav e  
pr oblem s, I rais e my head and
 I talk to God.  So I do 
believ e in God, d es p it e o f  

everything".  I cannot expl
ain wh y it happened to so 
many people and
 so many 
people perished and so
 many people didn't su
rviv e this , I canno
t, don't ask me wh y 
it happened.  But I 
do belie ve in God.
 
Q: Tell us a little  bit mo
re about the life and
 Buenos Aires.  
And your husband 
worked very hard?
 
A: W or k ed ver y hard.   My s i st er, bec a us e 
m y mot her  was  a dent ist, my s i st er went, 
she had very little education,
 but she wanted to do someth
ing in this profession, so 
she enrolled in a school for 
dental mechanics.  And she 
was livin g with us.  So I 
was alone in the hous e.  An
d I was trying the best I ca
n to shop, to clean, to do 
ev er ything,  I was j ust a hous e frau.  And 
my  husband was s uc h t o pr os per a lot.  
And my cous in had t w o litt le
 boys and I was alwa ys playi
ng wit h t hem.  And t h en I  
heard that they were talk in
g behind my back, 
there must be somethin g wrong wit h  
me that I don't have 
children.  And they said, all righ
t, aft er what s h e went t hroug h,  
is not.  And this didn't both
er m e,  but I wanted ver y m uc h
 to have a ch
ild because I 
alwa ys loved children and I 
wanted to have at leas
t one child and my husband 
didn't want to.  Any
how, I was working on 
him, working on him, and finally , in 
October 27,  '49, I had a litt le
 boy.  I named him aft er my
 fat her, Dav i d.  And he was  
a very little precious boy, bu
t I had a lot of problem s with
 him.  He was a very sick 
child.  I think all the misery what I went th
rough went into this 
child becaus e he was 
a beautiful, well formed child
, but  he was such a sickly 
child t hat  ther e was a t im e  
that I had six doctors in my house and th
ey didn't know what 
to do with
 him. 
Anyhow, I was lucky, I found 
a very nice pediat
r ic i an, Dr.  Ber n oc he( ph), and he was  
giving him vitamin shots and 
he s tart ed t o develop.  Ne
v er a big eat er,
 never that, 
but very good lookin g.  When
 I used to wa lk with him on
 the street, people used t o  
__________, used to stop 
me, "What a beautiful 
child, is this a boy 
or a girl?"  Then 
one day m y hus b and said to 
me, "Look, one child is no
t good, we hav e t o hav e 
anot her one".  So t hen ther e was anot he
r boy, his name is 
M ic h ael and he was  
born October 8, 1953. 
 Both children we
re born on October, this
 is the very time, a 
good time because this
 is springtime in B
uenos Aires and it's easi
er to have a child 
during the summ er, than for the winter.  T
he c l im ate is t h er e quit e hum id, y o u k now,  
so it was a good time to 
have the childr en.   Her e I 
wa s wit h t w o litt le bo ys .
 
Q: Did y o u ev er t h ink y ou would le
av e your new f o und home again?
 
A: Never.  But my 
husband had a sister and a brothe
r t h at em igrat e d t o New York 
and they wouldn't let him be.
  They said, th
ey, "From the whol
e family nobody 
sur v ived, j u st us t hr e e,  we 
have to be together
".  Despit e that m y
 whole family was 
in Buenos Aires.  So
 when he used to get le
t t ers fr om them and he us ed to s ay  tha t  
we have t o go to t h e Embas sy and t her e 
was alwa ys a quota a
nd y ou c ould wait a 
long time, so he said, "We have
 to register".  I used to say, "But my family is here, 
my family is here".  And 
he wa s a very good, lo ving 
husband and he didn't want to 

dist ur b me.   Then my sist er met a boy an
d t hey got married and s he sett led dow n  
and s he also st art ed t o hav e f am i ly,  my 
s ist er has t w o sons  
and a daughte
r.  My 
sister at the present time
 has nine grandchildren and 
she is in Buenos Aires, 
Ar gent ina.  And we wer e v ery , v ery c l os
e, but my husband sa
id to me, 
"You don't 
have any obligat ion to your si
ster now".  You know
,  I didn't  want  t o
 hear about it. 
And then when my
 children started to be older and 
my oldest son start e d to attend 
school, my husband went
 and without my
 knowledge, a fe
w years ago, an d 
regist er ed us in t h e Amer ic an embas sy.  
And we got notic es aft e r not ic es t h at our  
quot a c am e up and we hav e
 to register and I was po
stponing, kept postponing, 
kept postponing.  And 
my husband started to
 work on our friend
s, we had a lot of 
friends.  My house was a
lways open.  And my
 husband is  a ve
ry good hearted 
person, very, he likes peopl
e around, very
 hospit able, so some
times for a Sunday 
dinner, without my knowledge
, he would bring me three 
or four young men that 
were not m arr ied, t h e bac helor s t hat he 
met someplace, had no
 meal and there I 
was  c ook ing.  And aft er aw
hile,  we bec am e pr os perous
 and I had a girl in the 
house, a maid  sleeping tha
t, because we lived in a very
 big house, I had two small 
children and I was ne
ver a big hero.  Oh
, if  somebody was 
coughing on the other 
street, I had a cold.  I mean, I had cold s 
and I had a lot of health
 problems and this 
was, a lot of work in the hou
s e an d it wa s mo re p r im it iv
e.   It was ev ery day y ou ha d 
to wash a big patio and a big, you know what
 is a patio, and a ve
ry, in front of  the 
house was,  the street  had to  be was h ed wit h water and 
soap, so it  was a lot of  
work, so I had a girl 
in the house.  An
d so I, I, I had, in em
er gency and I had t o pu t  
that t oget h er, dinner, but I h
ad help.   And then, s o he st ar
ted to work on
 our friends 
and they used to come to 
m e, " Y ou hav e the oppor tunity for y o ur childr en, f o r the 
fut ure, t o go".  And one day I 
had a long t a lk wit h my s i st er
 and I said to her, "Look, 
I am going to Am er ic an, t h e 
golden land, t h e land of op
port unity,  and I want you t o  
promise me that 
you will come after me, 
and I am opening up t
he door for you, you 
have", by this time she had 
two little boys, "A
nd so you will come 
to me".  And o n  
October 30, 1956, after a jet 
trip, we came here.  And it
 was a ver y big cult ur al  
shock t o m e.  
 
Q: What was the expectation, what did y
ou expect?  You said 
the land of golden 
opportunity, but wh at 
was, did y o u hav e any...
 
A: You see,  in Buenos Air es  I m is s ed a lo
t, there was no adult 
educ at ion, t her e was  
no libr ar i es,  I mean, in all the 
free, I wanted for my
 whole life, when I 
was a little girl, 
the most popular book was G
one With The Wind. 
 It was translated 
in Polish and in 
1939, before the war,
 I could never get the book beca
use this was such a popular 
book in t he library t h at my nam e didn't c o
me up.  So when I, w
hen I was in Buenos 
Air es, I  want ed to read t he 
book and I we nt, there wa s no
 librar y, I went and th e 
book was so expensive
 that I couldn't afford to buy 
t h is book, so I was kind of  
frust r at ed.  And t hen I was t o ld
 they have public 
libr ar ies , there is public educ at ion if  

you are a good student, you 
get a stipend and you can 
go even to college without 
paying.  So all those things 
were very im por tant to me.  
So this is, I 
wasn't looking 
for material things, I 
was  looking mor e f or c u lt ur al t h
ings, for a good 
future for my 
children because since 
my parents gave me 
a base, such a good 
educatio n, such a 
cur i os it y f or  lif e, I  want ed t o r ec i pr oc at e and 
give m y children j u st 
a little bi
t of it. 
And I s a w the lim it e d,  the lim ited opportuni
ties in Buenos Aires.
  In Buenos Aires 
there are two classes, very 
poor and very rich.  And in 
order to go to
 high school, 
you have to 
pay, __________.
 
Q: So did it tu
rn out that ea
s y  in A m er ic a ?
 
A: No, in America was ve
ry hard f or me.  First 
of all,  when I left 
Buenos Aires, I live d 
in a beautif ul house with a ga r d en, with a pat i o, wit h a 
girl in the hou
se, so I was 
kind of all ready spoiled. 
 Here I cam e and the apartm
ent that my br other- in- l a w  
rented t o m e was in a pr iv at e house.   As much
 as I was trying to fi
x it up a little b it 
with plants, with
 things, it was not 
__________.  Then I ha
d to learn another 
language, English, agai
n.  And not, it wa s a real, 
I mean I bought 
a Spanish, now 
Spanish/Englis h dictionary, it 
was a r eal chor e.  And t
hen I had, my oldest son was 
seven and the younger 
was three, I took hi
m t o s c hool and, ok ay,  aft er a v er y s hort  
time he learned Englis h, but 
it was a big deal from him, 
you know.  Here in Buenos 
Air es he was play ing t he pi
ano all ready and he was a go
od student.  An d here he 
had t o st art  from the beginni
ng.  The y ounger one was  three y e ar s old, s o this was  
not a pr oblem f or  him.   Very  s o on, y o u know
, he, we, I used to ta
ke him to the park 
and he had little friends.  
But not for older, my
 older one, it was  a v er y c u ltur a l 
shock.  So,  I felt  ver y bad 
about  it, aft er a s h ort t im e, he 
adjust himself, but it  was a 
shock for him.  And for me, to
 live in a house 
like this, not to ha
ve help and learn 
another language, and to
 be separated from my family
.  When the holidays came, I 
had t o go t o my s ist er- i n- la
w, it  was a diff er ent  stor y.
 
Q: Tell me, or tell us, 
a litt le bit m or e about
 the relationship then, with the new family  
or with the...
 
A: T h er e was a diff er ent relat i ons h ip, t h at' s 
what I was, I don't el
aborate more, but it 
was a different rela tionship.  
In Buenos Aires, 
I was in my venue,
 I was, my uncle 
was on my cult ural level, he knew, if I woul
d go and t e ll him that 
I wanted to
 buy this 
book, he would buy me. 
 I would nev er do it.   So it wa
s  a diff erent  stor y.  Her e it 
was, when we ca
m e,  we f ir st s pok e Spanish, y o
u know.  I wa s told I shouldn't 
speak Spanish, I should le ar
n English right away.  Be
cause if  I would speak 
Spanish, I would be a second 
c l as s c it iz e n.   You k now.  So t h er e was a r eality,  
there was a v ery c o ld realit
y, for a whole y e ar I was goi
ng out and cry ing my ey es  
out and when my sister fou
nd out,  she wr ot e me a letter,
 I should come right back. 
It was, for a couple of
 years it  was not ta
lk for her coming her
e, but for me going 
ba ck .  A n d  it wa s a v ery 
big shock for my husband be
c a us e in Buenos Air es h e  

was  his own m a n, he was  the 
boss.  He re he had to, with
out  the language,  t o work  
for somebody.  And it 
was very, very
, very hard 
for him.  Ve ry ha
rd.  Sometimes he 
used to work on two jo
bs.  After a very shor
t time, I realize that 
I have to help, if I 
wanted to bring my 
children in a certain 
__________, I had to help.
 
Q: So what did y ou do, did y ou c o
ntinue some kind of education?
 
A: Well, when my children got 
a lit t le older, I dec i ded t hat
 I have t o do somet h ing .  
And I found out that there is  
a very bid need for x-
ray technician at th
is time.  It was 
late 50's, beginning of 60's, 
and this  would be a good fi
eld.  So I had a friend of 
mine wh o had a garage and 
he was a very good mec
hanic, had his own business 
and he was near _
_________ Ho spit al on Jerome(ph) 
Avenue.  And he
 had a lot of 
doctors that were coming
 from the x-ray __________ 
department, fixing cars 
bec aus e a lot of t hem , he wa
s a v ery good m ec h anic f or 
for e ign car s  and they  had 
foreign cars.  So th
ey asked this , he asked them, how
 can I approach this that I 
wanted to work in x
-ray?  So they sent him, told 
him I should come 
to the chief of 
the depart ment.  So I  got dress e d and I we
nt to t he c h ief of the departm e nt and I  
spok e t o him and I said I will
 be very much int erest ed in
, to go t o sc hool and be x -
ray technician .  He said, "This is a very 
good field because we 
need a lot of x-ray 
technician".  An d he send 
me to somebody who was in
 char ge in Mo
unt Sinai( ph)  
Hospit al, of the x-ray school.  And I we nt 
to her and she wa s ve
ry sympathetic to 
me and I told her 
that I don't have a high school dipl
om a,  and s h e said t o me t hat i f  
I prom is e her that aft er s i x months, I gi
ve her a high school 
equivalency, I can 
att end t h e sc hool.  So ther
e I was, going t o Mount Sinai
.  I was living ther e near 
__________ Hospit al, a
nd every day when my childr
en came from school, 3:00, I 
had t o leav e t hem unt i l 5:30, 6: 00 unt i l 
m y hus band c am e.  And from 4: 00 unti l 
10:00 I had school in Mount Si
nai.  Then I used to come ba
ck and then I also had to 
learn the equivalen
cy, so __________ it  was quit e 
hectic.  Okay, I made the 
equivalency and then I finished x-ra
y technician and my husband was very  
unhappy that I am going and
 I'm lookin g for a profe
ssion because the European 
men are very proud people and 
it was, it was very upse
tting to him, he cannot 
support his family in 
a certain style.  But, I saw th
e m a n was  wor k ing t w o j obs and 
when I was going, walking on

Q: Interview with Lily  Ma
zur Margules conducted by
 __________ on
 August 27, 
1996.  This is t
ape four, side A.
 
A: For me, I just had to buy for them, yo
u k now.  He gave m e a certain am ount of 
money and I felt bad about it and
 I felt bad f o r him, t h at he
, y o u k n o w.  S o it wa s, it 
was quite a problem for 
me to come and say that  I want to go to school, it took quit e 
an adjustment of 
him, of his part.
 
Q: Did y o u feel that at that 
t ime,  late 50's , Am er ic ans t h at  you m et wanted t o k n o w 
about the Holo caust ex
perience or didn't know anything
, did you ever talk about it ?
 
A: I never talk ed 
about it.  I never talk ed about it.  The only time
 that I talked, I had a 
lot of friends that were surv
iv ors, when we used
 to, and we used to 
meet a lot.  We 
used to entertain each
 other, y ou know, I had a v ery 
good social life.  We cling to 
each other because we had no 
families, so like, friends we
re families.  
Very few of 
them had f am ilies.  And s o
 we c ling to eac h ot her.   
Whenever we ca
me together , 
we used to talk abou
t all kinds of things, we used to
 t a lk polit i cs and what m ov i e di d 
you saw, but we always ended
 with our, what we went
 t hr o ugh.   T h is one was 
talk ing about it, and this was the end.  And so
, so it was in us.  And another thing, I 
us ed t o have a lot of nigh
tm ar es.   I us ed to wak e up 
and screaming, 
yelling, and I 
was, alwa ys my husband used
 to wake me up. 
 So in my heart, 
I was always living 
with it. It was never 
abandoned me.  And I, and everyt
hing was wr it ten in blood an d 
tears inside of me.  But I neve
r wanted to talk 
about it and to bu
r den my c h ildr en  
about it.  So be
tween ourselves, the su
r v iv or s, we us ed to 
share our experiences 
and this was always th
e end of our c onvers at i on.  Bu
t we  never spok
e t o any b od y  
els e because a lot of my fr i
ends had a number and they fe
lt ver y bad when s o me o f  
them, they used to 
go on the bus and peopl
e used to talk about the number.  I 
didn't hav e a num ber bec a us e in
 this concentration camp 
wher e I was, t h ey didn't  
put a number, I just ha
d a num ber , and I am so sor r y t h
at the f ir st t h ing aft er I was  
liber at ed in F lum a( ph), I thr e
w this number away int o the 
snow.  I should have kept 
it as a m e mento, all right , som e things. 
 But  we nev er, you 
see, we were always 
considered second class citizen.  We all 
spoke wi th an accent
 and we all, and we 
alwa ys, a lot of people were
 very jealous of us, becaus
e nobody from our people 
went __________.  Nobody asked 
from help and a mother us
ed to say to a child, 
"A s t om ach that is not made fr om glass. 
 If you go to someb
ody's house, and even 
if y o u are hungr y, y o u refuse bec a us e y o
u f i ll y our stom ach t h e way I f i ll your  
stomach".  And we never, we
 wer e v ery pr oud people. 
 When we, we worked very 
hard, we were very am
bitious that our children should 
have a very good educatio n, 
we want ed the best f or  them, 
and we never wanted any ch
ar it y.  V e ry fe w, m ay be  
in the beginning when the first came, th
ey took something from the Jewis h  
organization, some
 help.   But r i ght  away ,  they wa
nt ed to st and our  own feet. 

Without the language, so
m e of them with not ev en a 
good education,
 they were 
ver y am bit i ous and t h ey  v ery,  t h ey  want ed 
very much to 
build a future 
and a lot of 
them are very successful.   And also, I had 
this, always the idea, 
t h at char it y begin s  
at home.  So I alwa
ys remembered that my mother
 used to say, "If you meet 
som ebody on the str e et and 
he or s h e put s  a hand in fr
ont of y o u, y o u hav e t o 
share it, you have to put so
mething in".  And this was 
stayin g with all my life and 
this is how I  br ough
t my children up.
 
Q: Did y o u feel s om et i mes t h at
 it was d iff ic u lt  for y o u 
t o be a m ot her bec a us e you 
want ed t o be, m ay b e giv e your c h ildr en, ov
erpr otect iv e, or was it
, do you think that 
the experiences...
 
A: I know that I was  a v er y ov er prot ec
tive mother.  I know that I wanted to 
com pensat e my children, w
hen they used to ask me, 
"Where is  my grandma ?  
Where is my grandpa?"  
I wa nted, I didn't, I told them t
hey are not here 
with us, that 
they are in heaven, you k
now, but I wanted to overco
mpensate, there was nothing 
too good f o r my childr e n.  And many t im es,
 I spoil them t oo m u ch.  I  did s poil them,  
yes, but t h is is bef or e, be
c aus e I s a id t hem,  "I  am  a 
mother, you know, and I am an 
aunt and ( nois es) ".  Bec a us e m y c h ildr en
 didn't have an aunt fr
om my side here. 
You know, so, yes, yes.
 
Q: When did your children begin to
 ask, did they ever ask you?
 
A: My children always we
r e as king about  their gr
andmother, you know, an d 
gr andf at her .  But t h e fir st ti
me, my oldest son, 
when he went to sch
ool, he started to 
lear n about  the Holoca
ust and he knew that
 I  was a s urv iv or.  But he nev er t a lke d  
about it  with me and
 he didn't want it, to know a
bout it .  He couldn't place his 
mot her in t h is s it u at ion becaus e he st arted 
t o read a lot and he 
knew about a lot. 
My youngest son found out about it the day
 that he decided, he
 already finished 
college, and he dec ided t o
 go, he f ound him self a jo
b in Los Angeles and he 
dec i ded t o go t o Los Angeles.  And he, it
 was t he last nigh
t when he was living 
here, and he was all pack ed and
 the next day we had to 
take him to the airport. 
And he said to me, "Ma", 
it  was already, my husband
 was already sleeping, and he 
said to me, "Ma,  I have to ask you somethin
g.  I know that yo
u are a s ur v iv or,  but  
you never talk  about it. 
 Why don't you want to
 tell me, I am a bi
g boy".  And I said, 
"M ic hael, why I nev er want ed to
 t e ll, I didn't want t o bur
den y o u".  He s a id t o me ,  
"Ma, I am a big boy, y o u hav e t o t e ll me.  
I want to share it wi
th you, especia lly now 
that I am leav ing t h e house"
.  And I was very nervous 
bec a us e when 
he went to 
college I knew, you know, that
 it was different, he wentto Boston Coll
ege for four 
year s, but  he was co
ming, here he was going to the 
ot her  s i de of, t o t h e Pac if i c 
Ocean, to t he ot her s i de of t
he United St ates, and he' s go
ing all alone, m y ba by is  
leaving me.  I was very
 upset.  So we were sitting ri
ght here by this  table and I 
start e d t o t e ll him.  And he was s i tting and 
we were talking until 3:
00 in t he m o rning.  

And when we finished talkin
g, I told him, he kissed 
me and he hugged me and he 
said, "I am ver y grat ef ul th
at you shar ed it with m e".  
And this is how he found out. 
And with my oldest son,
 later on, I star ted to tell him,
 but he is  v ery  s e ns it iv e, he 
didn't want, he didn't want to
 know too much.  
He didn't want to 
know too much, no. 
 
Q: Did it bother you sometime
s that also, would you have
 liked people to wanting to 
know more, other people?
 
A: You see, when we were 
young, the survivors, we we
re so busy bringing up the 
childr en,  m ak i ng up a liv i ng, ac quiring s om e 
k i nd of  educ at ion t h at it stay ed wit h  us .  
But t h en,  I joined an or
ganiz a tion, Am er ican Sur viv or, Am er ic an Holoca us t  
Survivors.  And wh at was bo
thering me the most, that 
before the holidays, the high 
holiday s, t h e J e wis h people go t o  the c em e
tery and I couldn't 
go.  I belonged to a 
Jewish Center and I, the firs
t thing when I started to make
 money, I we
nt there and 
the memorial tablet s, I went  to make two ta
blets,  f or m y mot her  and my f at h er.  And 
it had t o c o st a c ert ain cent of m o ney 
and I paid them out.  And every year, when 
there is, how they say, th
e day  they, t he mem or ial s e
rvices, the day that they 
pass ed away,  t hat  is  a pr ay er  for the dea d that  is s a id, so ev er y y e ar,  y o u put  
candles on and I used, so I knew wh at the 
date for my mother, 
but for my father I 
didn't know, so I had a date
, I took and arbitrary date 
for the liquidation of the 
Vilna(ph) ghetto, so I, it is 
just around the high holidays,
 so this is when I, when I 
mourn m y f at her.  So I put, I 
put t h e light s on and t h en I t e
ll my s o n t o s ay a prayer,  
you know.   And t h is  is, be
c ause I  want my c h ildren t o
 know that they hav e  
grandparents.  And also, th
e memorial, memorial candles
 are lit in the Jewish 
Center.  So , it's, this is ho
w I observe.  But, 
when, when I joined
 this organization, 
they have onc e a y ear, a v ery big c omm em or
at iv e s erv ic e s.  A n d th is is d on e in a  
ver y good t ast e.  And so I  c om e, I  go t her
e and I go t h er e lik e t o
 the cemete
ry.  And 
this is the time that I remember, recite in 
mind, all my family  t
hat perished and all,  
my par e nts and, y ou k now, my
 cousins and all of them.  
Bec a us e fr om my m other 's  
side, there were six children,
 nobody surviv ed.  There we re
 also, children's children, 
grandchildren, nobody 
surviv ed.  So my mo
ther's, the Lipkovich(
ph) family, there is 
nobody survived.  So 
they are part of the six _____
_____.  So this is when I come 
and say, and pay honor to t h
eir memory.  And every year 
I'm going t here and t h is i s  
kind of like, that like I go
 to the cemetery.  Bu t, you 
see, when thos
e people formed 
their s oc i et y, Am er ican Holoc aust Surv
iv or s, and Volsa( ph) Ghett o Holoc aust  
Survivors, they kind 
of open the door for 
the surviv ors to talk. 
 And this is when the 
sur v iv or s bec am e a litt le olde
r.  And had a little time to
 shar e t heir  ex
periences, to 
talk about it .  To fe
el an obligation that they, that to tell the world wh at happened to 
them, to make sure 
it  shouldn't happen a
gain.  And because 
they became more 
mat ure and became bett
er educated and had a little more
 time to give
, were not so 
busy wit h mak i ng a living and with litt le c h
ildr en and the diapers 
and the pr oblems .  
So they start, they formed a 
s o
c i ety and t h ey wok e up 
and they  had a l l k i nds of  

obligat ions that they felt t h
at they have to fulfill.  Es
pecially when it became known 
that there are people that n
egate that the Ho lo
caust every existed.
  And that they 
want  t o r e writ e histor y.   So we
 f e lt th at t h is  is  ou r t im e 
for us to speak 
up.  That we 
ar e really, by s ilenc e, c omm itt i ng a ver y 
big inj ust ice to t h os e who c a nnot s pe ak .
 
Q: So when was tha
t, about, when you decided t
hat now you will speak out?
 
A: It was, I  would s ay,  in t h e m iddle of t
he 70' s.  Yes ,  it was 
in t h e m iddle of  t he 
70's.  And we had, we  had al
l kinds of get-togethers.  
We we nt to Washington and 
took cans of docume
nt s, m i lk c ans  of doc um e nts  we
r e br ought fr om
 Warsaw ghetto 
and it was a cor n ers t one put  
for the Ho locaust Museum in
, on the Mall.  Then w e  
had, we had all kinds of 
s peaker s and I r e mem ber t h at one of t he spe ak er s, we 
were sitting in th
e Memorial Park, she wa s a professor 
of J u daic at  the Univ er sit y of 
Miami and she said, and she 
was talk ing and she says
, "I wa nted to ask yo u 
sur v iv or s a quest ion.  How m
any of y o u hav e  childr en in
 college, have childr en that  
finished college?"  And you know, from 
all those people that
 ar e sitt ing, the 
thousands  and t hous a nds, t h er e was not 
one per s on.  She s ay s, " W e ar e am az ing 
people because we are trying
 to give our children what
 we missed.  And we  are 
overprotective, we overindul
ged t hem, but we ar e giv i ng t h em t h e best that  we 
can".  And if you talk toda
y to the survivor s, very fe
w of them that didn't have 
childr en,  pr of es sor s, j o ur nalists, anc h ors( ph
),  doct ors,  I mean, cr eme de la cr em e.  
 
Q: I would like to ask you 
one question.  Yo u have lear
ned so many languages, to 
some degree, that it is
 quit e amaz ing.   Did it  help y ou,
 did it make yo
u feel proud or 
did it int im i dat e y o u t o s om e degree 
because you could never really learn a 
language perfectly?
  Do you know what I mean?
 
A: I k now what  y o u mean.   It didn't m a
k e m e pr oud bec aus e I lear ned thes e 
languages because of the circumstances duri
ng my life.  But, w
hen I came to the 
United St at es and I m ade it
 my business to 
learn Englis h and the f i rst book t h at I  
lear ned was G one With The W i nd, with Po
lish and English dict
ionary, imagine. 
And after I read it firs
t, I read it  again.  
And this is what, my fa
vor it e books.   And I  
start e d t o r ead a lot and I st
arted to educate myself a lo
t.  But, I liked, 
I alwa ys liked 
to read, so I acquired a lo
t of language, I started to
 read the books of Edn a  
Fair bur g( ph) and, y o u know, s o I, so s h e 
had acquainted me wh
at was going in th e 
United St at es and it was, 
and becaus e of read
ing I lear ned a lot.  But, bec ause I  
spok e with an ac cent,  I was 
ver y int im idat e d.   Bec aus e ev en if I s a id som et h ing, 
bec aus e I  s pok e wit h an ac c ent,  I was  look
ed like, ah, what does
 she know?  So, I  
was very intimidated an
d I didn't, I was kind
 of, not sure of myself.  But then,  when 
Henr y Kis s i nger bec a me t h e Sec r et ary of 
St ate and I heard hi
m speak this heavy  
German accent, I said to my
self, "What's going on here?"
  I said, "If he is so 
knowledgeable and he is spea
king in this accent, I am 
going to speak".  And I 
started to speak.  And this 
is what happened to me.  So 
I know that many times, 

when I have to to th
e people, that I am not educated
.  They think that because I 
speak with an accent, 
I don't know what I'm talk ing abou
t.  But if I have
 to do with 
people that have a certain am
ount of cult ure, they say,
 "Oh, you have a very nice 
accent.  Oh, I like this accent.  Oh, it's 
c h arm i ng".  You k now, 
so, it has becom e, it  
has becom e lik e a way  of lif e
.  An d now, I just don't pay 
t oo m u ch att ention.  W h en I  
have to say something, I say 
it.  If I say that I don't know
 anything about it, I don't. 
But many times, I li
sten to Jeopardy and
 __________.  And I se
e that I have so 
many ans w ers,  that  I k now s o m a ny 
ans w ers ,  t h at ev en
 college students, 
sometimes I know this  answer and they 
don't know.  And I don't say that I know 
everything and I'm no
t going to Jeopardy, but I see my
self, that speaking without an 
ac cent is not s o im port ant.  T h is 
is, I came to this conclusion.  
 
Q: You mentioned that 
you had nightmares?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Do you still ha
v e nightmar es?
 
A: Oh, I still have a 
lot  of  nightm ares.   Many  tim es  
I wake up and I 
hear  t he dogs  
barking and I'm alwa ys runn
ing and I always see the SS 
people with their uniforms, 
running after me.  And they will, the nightm
ares are just a way 
of life.  This is 
something that I think I will a
lways have it.  There are cert
ain sounds that I hear, the 
barking and, all the yelling, they
 ar e, t h is  is , th is is  st a
ys with me, that is never, I 
don't think it will
 never go away.
 
Q: Did you always try to deal
 with it y our s e lf, or did you als o to try t o go t o  
therapists or...
 
A: No, I don't believe
 in t h erapy.  I am , I, m ay b e y o u s ay  that I  am old-f as h ioned ,  
but I feel that if you hav
e a problem, you have somebody
 close to you, it doesn't 
even have to be 
f am i ly , a good fr iend, you c an t a lk it
 ov er.  J ust by  talk ing about it ,  
just by exchange, 
exchange, you know
, letting it out, do
n't keep it insi
de, it  is better 
bec aus e what c an a t herapis t  who was n't t h
er e, tell m e  what t o do?  Oh, how ca n 
he, nobody can understand unles
s you were there, what  wa
s taken away from me. 
You know, what I was left, the wound that
 I have, and I am not talking about 
physical wound, I'm talk ing 
about emotional wound.  Th
is is something, I am, 
som et h ing when I am  talk ing about, I feel th
at, I talk in the th
ird person, this i s  
som et h ing unreal, t hat  it di
dn't happen to me.  And th
en ot her thing, whenever I  
hav e t o t a lk  about  it, I  am s ic k alr eady a 
long time befo
re, and I am sick already a 
long time after.  So
 many times, you have to let it
 go and let the 
sleeping go t o  
sleep.  But on the other hand
, when I talk to the childr
en in school, I say to them, 
that if you s ee t hat  inj u stic e is  being done, 
and you ar e s ilent , y o u' re just  as guilt y as 

the perpetrator.  So when you see there is
 something wrong, yo
u have to speak u p  
about it.  So this
 is the reason that I am 
s itt ing and t a lk ing t o y o u.
 
Q: The nightmares are one 
k i nd of  memor y, but what ar e mem or ies t h at y o u 
choose, that you decide 
to go back to?  Can yo
u giv e us  one or t w o. ..
 
A: T h e m e mor i es of my happy
 childhood, of my parents, 
of my mot her in a whit e 
coat, standing in her office
, and me sitting there a
nd pretending that I am her 
helper, this is my mother.  Of my father
, that when he would 
come and bring us 
choc olat e and s ay, " M y  proud litt le gir ls "
.  Or he would have 
__________ would say 
to him what ar e, y ou k now, of m y  father
 taking him by his ha
nd, when my mother 
told him he should take me to
 the library, of my
 father taki
ng me to a children's 
conc ert, of my fat h er when I didn't k now
 s o met h ing and I woul
d go to him and say  
to him, what this word mean
s, you know.  Of the garden 
security, of my
 aunt, that 
was my second mother, of  
my school, of my teachers
.  I have ve
ry fun, good 
teac hers t h at wer e s o dedicat e d.  Of the 
respect that we had fo
r the teachers.  Of 
the unif orm s that we had. 
 You know, of the s k i v ac a
tion that we went.  Of th e 
summ er vacat i on when we 
were walking, this, most 
of the people that I handled 
before I was so 
badly hurt.  Of my
 little friends.
 
Q: Do y o u hav e m ement os, do y o u have
 pict ur es fr om 
your earlier life?
 
A: I just have a few pictures
 that I found in Buenos Aire
s that were sent by my 
fat her t o his br ot her.  Very f e w of 
t hem.  And v ery f e w mementos bec a us e I  
rem ember  t hat bef or e we left 
our house and went 
to the ghetto, we were afraid to 
tak e the pic t ur es and t hen we
 were destroying them so th
ere was not hing ther e left.  
And also, my friend to went
 to the Lithuania Museum and 
found some articles that I 
wr ot e on diplom as or  paper s or ess ay  t hat
 I wr ot e, t h is,  he br
ought me just about 
two years ago when he came 
from __________.  But I am, 
I don't have, nothing, I 
hav e not h ing.  
 
Q: How do you f e el about Ger m
any and Germans today?  
 
A: As I told you be
f or e, I  s p ok e a ver y good G erm
an and I wr ote 
German and I 
lov e d t he Germ an lit er atur e
.  And I memorized a lot 
of poem s and I  r emember 
__________, you know, and I reme
mber the ghetto 
poems, the, we wr ited, I don't 
__________.  And also
, I cannot forget and 
I will never forg
ive.  I will never, never 
for g iv e.  And what is
 the worst part of it is negat
ion.  Becaus e t h e Germ an people 
stood by and let one ig nora
mus, house painter, to turn
 the whole world around and 
to, they stood by when the Je
ws were made scape
goat, for no reason
.  To stand by 
and not to say anything and pa
rticipate in all this
 br ut ality ,  this m a ster plan, t h is  
sc ient if ic m ast er  plan.   W h
ere wer e t he doctor s, t h e sc ient ists , t he c u lt ur e,  the 
art ist s, t he cult ur e of peopl
e t hat s hould st ay and say, 
" W hy ?  W h y  did t h es e peo p le 

do?"  You see,Jews were not allowe
d to have property,
 so if  they had 
a little gold, if 
they had a little 
silver, it was the only se
curity they had,
 could carry from
 one land t o 
the ot her.   My f at her  c ouldn't buy a phar ma
cy because he was a Jew.  I mean, so 
this, and we were
, my, I will neve
r forgive them.  Th
ey're from such 
a smart culture, 
good human being, they m
ade us subhuman, who doesn't
 __________, wh o felt  so 
bad he couldn't take care of
 his family .  All of a sudden
 who had doubted that he is  
a hum an being in t he f i
rst place.  I can neve
r forgive it.  And I will never forget it.
 
Q: At one time it was your dr eam to go to Israel.
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you went to the United
 St ates and t o Ar gent ina in
stead, but did you ever go 
to Israel?
 
A: Yes,  I went to Isr
ael.  I have friends that
 were, I was in kibbutz
 in  Israel and I am 
in touch with them a
nd I go and visit Israel
.  And my oldest son 
was in, spent a year 
in Israel.  And I always felt 
v ery guilty t h at I didn't go t
here and settle.  That due to 
the circumstances, because my
 firm belief it st
ill today that we 
sur vivors have t o  
build a future in our own la
nd.  So I feel very guilty 
about it and I belong to an 
organization that suppo
rts Israel and I, financially, I hel
p more than I c
an, but I, and 
I'm very int erest ed. 
 My husband, also, about the fu
t ur e and t h e s urv ival of th e 
sovereign s t at e of  Isr ael.  This 
is, for me, very, 
very import ant.
 
Q: How does your husband
 feel about you speaki
ng about your experience?
 
A: My husband feels 
very bad about it.  He is ve
ry upset becaus
e he, before I 
speak I am  upset and aft er war ds
.  So he, he says t o me that
 I am, this is like, I am 
overdoing it , that this is  like 
a self-torture and he would ra
ther not, not I should do it. 
But this is one, y o u k now, 
in a marr iage y ou 
have many disagree
ment, and this i s  
one of the disagreement becaus
e I feel that I have to do
 it.  So he is not happy 
about it .

Q: Interview with Lily Ma
zur Margules.  This is
 tape four, side B.  I thin k I would just 
lik e t o as k y ou one last ques
t ion.  I s ther e anyt hing, wh
en you look back on y our lif e  
now, is there anything that you would like 
to say to finish th
is interview?  Any 
message, any thou
ght t hat y o u hav e t o c o nc lude?
 
A: I would like to co
nclude with, with the thought th
at the people who will listen to 
me, s hould lear n on t he mist ak es that we
re done in t h e past.  And s h ould m ak e  
sure that in nocent people s
houldn't have to go 
through what me and
 my family and 
my friends went through be
cause of one dictator who' s name I don't want to even 
pronounce.  Who shoul
d speak up when injustice is 
done, shouldn't 
be silent.  I 

don't want t o hear that the 
world was silent when so mu
ch injustice wa
s done.  And 
I feel that the Ho lo
caust wa s a unique experience in 
t h e hist ory  of  mank ind.  You 
cannot compare it with anything that wa
s done, you cannot co
mpare it what was 
do n e in, r e ce nt ly , in B os n ia.  T h is is a 
completely different 
stor y, that thr o ugh 
religion t hey ar e f i ght ing be
t w een them self .   One' s, th
ey 'r e doing,  the Cr oat e s ar e 
doing somethin g to this an
d the __________ are doing to th
em.  It was done to us. 
We were humiliated
, we were dehu
m aniz e d and we had, we h ad no mea ns t o  
defend ourself.  To speak up. 
 To say, t o ask why.  We
 had no weapons
, we had n o  
country, we had no means. 
 An d those people that pers
ecuted us, have to pay for 
their sins.  And please don't
 be silent, get involved when
 injustice is done.  And 
make sure that somethin g lik e this will never, never,
 never happen again.  Thank 
you.
 
Q: Thank you.
