Question: This is an interview with the 
U
.
S
. Holo caust Memo rial Museum. Today 
is the 15
th
 of October, 2010. I™m here with 
Erica Kanter
, and I am 
Ann Erling
. 
So, let™s start. Let™s start from the very 
beginning. Could we get your full name, 
the name, if it was different at birth, 
and your birthdate 
and where you born, 
please? 
Answer: Yes. The name is 
Erica Kanter
. Th e maid en  n ame was 
Hecht
, 
h-e-c-h-t
. 
I was born in 
Stuttgart
, 
Germany
 in April 19
th
, 1929. 
Q: Okay , and th en just tell me about y
our ch ildhood; your home and your family, 
and what Œ what life was like? 

A: I lived in 
Stuttgart
. My father was a physician. My father was Jewish, my 
mother was Catholic, but neither of them r
eally practiced their religion. My father 
was a very successful physician, so we had 
a very nice, privileged life. We lived in 
Stuttgart
, which was a very modern city at
 the time. They had buildings by 
Gropiu s
, and I had a very privileged childhood
. We had live-in helpers who were 
like family and so 
my  childhood was a ve
ry happy childhood. 
Q: Do you have
 any siblings? 
A: Yes, I have a sister who™s five ye
ars older than I, here name is Œ was 
Lisalotte
(ph), and now is 
Lisa
. And my  brother, who™s three years older than I,

his name is 
Karl Theodore
, and is now 
Ted
. My sister l ives in 
Los Angeles
, my 
brother lives in 
Ann Arbor
, 
Michigan
. 
Q: Okay , did you Œ you attended school in 
Stuttgart
? 
A: Yes, I went to elementary school, and 
Œ for four years, and my  teacher, whom I 
adored, was Fraulein 
Grunin ger
(ph). And I went to the 
Wagenb org
(ph) 
schule
 
and had a very happy early education. 
Q: Were there both Jewish and n
on-Jewish children at this school? 
A: Yes, there were all kinds of children, 
Jewish, Catholic, Protestant. And I have a 
friendship book in which some of them 
signed and had their pictures, and they™re 

of all religions. 
Q: Okay, so a lot of your friends
 were both Jewish and non-Jewish? 
A: Yes, mm-hm. 
Q: Okay. What are some of your
 earliest ch ildhood memories? 
A: Well, I have a lot of them, and many of
 them are in a memoir which I wrote, 
and was published last yea
r. We were very close to my parents and we did the 
usual amusements and entertainments for 
Germans of the time. We went walk ing 

a lot, and we went to the puppet theate
r, and we visited my  grandparents, who 
lived in 
Ulm
. And in the summer, we went to 
Czechoslovakia
, where my 
maternal grandparents had an estate, whic
h was a castle. And so for the first sev en

5
or eight years of my  life, I went to 
Czechoslovakia
 every summer to spend time at 
the castle. So Œ 
Q: That™s so cool. 
A: Œ I had a very priv ileged childh
ood. No thing but 
happy childhood. 
Q: That™s so good. So  you said that your 
family didn™t really practice religion. Did 
you do any Œ prac Œ do any Œ I 
guess, recognize any Jewish holiday s or Ch ristian 
holid ays? 

A: Not really. I-I think even
 my grandparents, my paternal grandparents, who 
were Jewish, I don™t think they practic
ed their religion either, which was not 
unusual for a lot of German Jews. But 
I did go to Sunday school. I went to 
German Lutheran Su nday school, and I 
think I just, you know, went once a week  
and it was just part of my  growing up, 
I guess. And then when I came to the 

United States
 in 1940, I became a memb er of the congregational church, wh ich 

apparently  is not too dissimilar fr
om the German Lutheran church. 
Q: Mm-hm. Remind me again what year you were born? 

A: I was born in 1929. 

Q: Okay. So, did you expe
rience any anti-Semitism wh
en you were growing up? 
A: Not really. It seems that 
Stuttgart
 was rather late in having anti-Semitism 
visible. I did know that Œ I think in 1938
 perhap s, I was no longer allowed to go to

the swimming pool. But I stayed in school, 
I think until early in 1939. However, in 
1938, my  father lost his medical license, and on 
Kristallnacht 
he was arrested and 
he was sent to 
Dach au
. Now, in those days, appare
ntly, you could still get out 
after a fo Œ short period. And he was ther
e for a month, and the requirements for 
leaving at that time, as far as I know, we
re that you had already applied for a visa 
to leave 
Germany
, and that you had served  in th
e German army in World War I. 
And my father was in the German army 
as a medic in World War I, but he was 
sent to 
Dach au
. And th en, we™re not a hundred percen
t sure if the story is true, but 
I was told that th
e police chief in 
Stuttgart
 had a six year old son, and my  father 
was the family doctor, and they say that my
 father saved the child™s life. And that 
when this police chief hear
d that my father was in 
Dach au
, and had already 
applied fo r a visa and had served  in the ar
my in World War I, he also helped him. 
So my father got out of 
Dachau
 after a month, after he had to have surgery which 
was caused by his stay in 
Dach au
, where they  ruin ed his sinuses. He left through
 
Switzerland
 and then went to 
Eng l and
. And he came to  
England
 in  September of 
1939. My brother, my sister and I were sent to 
England
 in, I think April of 1939, 
on th e 
Kindertransport
. 
Q: Okay. Well, let™s Œ let™s back up a little 
fur Œ a little bit before
 we talk about the 
Kindertransport
. Do you rememb er Œ you said you rememb er not being ab le to

go to  the swimming pool any more. Do y
ou reme mb er anything else happening at 
Œ you know, your father losing his prac
tice, but I me an, did children treat you 
differently at school? 
A: No, no. No one treated 
me differently wh ile I was 
still in school. My teacher 
didn™t, my friends didn™t. So it really 
didn™t affect me too much. And I was 
probably doing something ve
ry silly, I Œ my mother 
did let me have English 
lessons for a short while. And I rememb
er going on th e street and practicing my  
little English sayings, which of course was 
not very smart, because if anyone had 
heard me, there might have been a problem,
 but fortunately no one ever heard me 
or paid attention. 

Q: So you attended sc
hool up until you left? 
A: Yes. I think I probably was taken out 
of school few weeks or months, I really 
don™t remember how long. But I know that 
my  mo ther had lots of clothes ma de for 
me to take to 
England
, and I did have these English lessons, but I don™t rememb er 
how long I was out of school. 
Q: Did your fami ly at home,
 did your parents talk about
 the Nazi rise to power? 
A: No, no. 
Q: It wasn™t a concern? 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter

A: No, th e only thing I reme mb er is that
 the night my father was arrested, my 
mo ther woke me up and I remember having 
to say goodbye to my father, but that™s 
Œ 
Q: How long Œ sorry to interrupt Œ 
A: That™s all Œ 

Q: Œ how long was he in 
Dach au
? 
A: About a month, I think.  
Q: Okay , so wh en did your pa
rents talk to you about the 
Kindertransport
? When 
did you know th at decision had been made? 
A: I don™t really remember. I don™t reme
mb er whether my  mo ther ever explained 
it to me. It was through my mother that we
 were able to get out, because she did 
all this while my father was in 
Dachau
. 
Q: So th is was in Ap
ril or May of ™39? 
A: I think we left in April 1939. 
Q: Okay . And th en what Œ what went into
 the preparation? Li
ke you said your 
mo ther had clothes Œ 
A: My mother had lots of clothes made
, and I had a ba Œ brand new quilt for my 
bed, and she packed all my  things, and I had some of my  favorite books. On e was 

about three 
Teddy
 bears, another one was about 
Kasp alay
(ph), which is a puppet.

And I also had family photo albums that
 she gave me. And Œ but I really don™t 
remember being scared or traumatized. I-I 
ju st didn™t really know what was going 
on, I was nine years old. 
Q: What about Œ and your
 brother and your sister
 were Œ went as well? 
A: Yes, we all three left together. Now, 
I™m sure that my sister, who was 14, and 
my  brother, who was 12, have mo re me mo ri
es of it than I did. My brother, for 
example, remembers my moth
er saying goodbye to us at the railroad station. And 
I™ve read recently that Nazis did not want
 parents on the station Œ on the platform, 
but apparently my  mo ther did go, a
nd my  brother reme mbers that. I don™t 
remember that at all. 

Q: So you don™t Œ you don™t 
recall the days leading up 
Œ whether or not Œ how you 
were feeling Œ 
A: No, not really. 

Q: Okay. Do you recall the Œ the journey to 
England
 at all? 
A: A little bit. I played the vi
olin at that time, and I kn
ow they made me play the 
violin on the train, because many Je
wish families bought expensive musical 

instruments to give to th ei
r children to take out, so th
at they could be sold for 
money later. And so  the Nazis wanted to ma
ke sure that I could play the violin ,

and I did, and I remember I played  ﬁ
Ach du lieber Augustine
,ﬂ which was a 
famous song at the time for children.
 But that™s all I really remember. 
Q: Okay , did you know if you went by train to Œ to 
Holland
? 
A: I think so , and then by whatev er to 
England
, and we went to 
Londo n
 where 
the three English families that were taki
ng us, met us. A nd my sister went to 
Buxton
, my  brother went to 
Harrow
, and I went to 
Ma rp le
, which is outside 
Manchester
. 
Q: Okay. So what was the fa
mily like who you
 lived with? 
A: My fo ster father was professor of engineering at the Univ ersity of 
Ma nchester
, 
and his wife 
Edith
. And th ey had twin daughters who were about six months older 
than I, 
Joyce
 and 
Kathleen
. And the day that I arrived, and we went to 
Ma rple
, 
my  English family had a high tea in my  honor. And I was very surp rised, because I 

thought my foster mother sp
oke fluent German, I thought
 this is very easy to 
understand. And then  when  it was bedtime, the wo man I thought was my  foster 
mother disappeared. 
Turns out that my 
foster parents had invited the German 
teacher from the high school to come fo
r the day and make my transition less 
traumatic. But from then on, 
I was on my own. But they were wonderful. And I 
am still in touch with them
, and in 2008 I went to 
Eng land
 for the twins 80
th
 
birthday. And we correspond,
 we send each other letters
 with pictures of our

11
grandchildren, and we™re still very close.
 The only one in the 
family who is that 
way with the English family is
 I. My brother and sister 
did not keep in touch with 
theirs until a few years later. 
Q: Okay . Wa Œ were there a lot of Englis
h customs that you had 
to adjust to, that 
was different from home? 
A: Well, the one that I remember Œ and at
 Œ at this time, yo
u could still write to 
Germany
 from 
England
. My  English foster mo ther always gave me tea, like 
everyone else in the family, but I refused 
to have milk in it, 
and she thought that 
that might not be good for me, so she wr
ote to my  mo ther and asked wh ether it 
was all right for me to have tea without 
milk in it. And my mother said, oh yes, 
she has tea at home all the time. W ell, wh
at my mother didn™t realize is that 
English tea is very strong 
and very dark, wh ereas in 
Germany
 tea is fairly weak. 
And so my  mo ther said no, 
it™s fine. So I learned to dr
ink English tea, but was not 
very fond of it. And I wasn™t too fond
 of mu tton either, although I did like 
Shepherd ™s
 
pie, which is ground mu tton with
 mashed potatoes and gravy. 
Q: I like that as well. 

A: And high tea, I liked hi
gh tea. And I had never had 
Jell-O
, and very often my  
English foster mo ther made a de
ssert with different colors of 
Jell-O
 that was all 
chopped up and very pretty
. And she also ma de lemon curd, wh ich I™d never had 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter

before. And she always told me when I me
t them later in 1980, that I would come 
to the kitchen and I would try to help, a
nd I would say, I will make Œ meaning that 
I would help her. And I reme mb er squeezi
ng lots of lemons for lemon curd. 
Q: So did Œ you said that 
you had taken some English le
ssons, but did it take you a 
while to learn the la Œ the Œ your new language? 
A: I guess so, although I really don™t rememb er. 

Q: Did you attend school
 when  you were in 
England
? 
A: Yes, I went to school a week after I got there. I went to 
Manchester
 High 
School for girls, which was an elementary school in 
Man ch e ster
, so we 
co mmu ted  fro m 
Marple 
to
 Manchester
, and the twins went wi
th me. I think they 
were probab ly a year ah ead of me in sc
hool. And I reme mb er loving my  school. 
And then when the war started in Septem
ber, after a while, when bomb ing started 
in 
Manchester
, like many other British children, we were evacuated to the 
countryside. So I had another English family, a Mrs.
 Emerson
 and her daughter, 
who was in her 20s. She was the Œ the Œ Mrs. 
Emerson
 was a widow. And I went 
to the 
Cheadle Hulme 
school, which was an affiliate of the school in 
Manchester
. 
Q: Did th e two twin s go w
ith you when you went Œ 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
13
A: No, th e twins went to boarding school. 
And the school I went to was a board ing 
school, but I went as a day student. 
Q: Where were your brother 
and sister at this time? 
A: My brother was in 
Harrow 
with his English family, and my  sister was in 
Buxton
 with hers. My brother™s family ha
d a daughter who was a little bit older 
than my  brother, and my  sist
er™s family I think had four
 children. And I saw them 
once while I was in 
England
, we all got together in 
Harrow
. 
Q: Did you return to 
Marp le 
after being evacuated to th
e country side, or did you Œ 
A: I went there I think on weekends, or wh
atever. I just didn™t go to school in 
Manchester 
any more. 
Q: Did you experience a
ny air raids, did you Œ 
A: No, I didn™t. 
Q: So what Œ do you recall ha Œ what 
your knowledge was of the war during this 
time? Did you read ab out it, or hear about what was going on? 
A: Not really. I knew that there was a wa
r. The one thing I do 
reme mb er is th at  
Princess
 Elizabeth
 and Princess 
Margaret Rose
, spoke on the radio every week 
to the children of 
Grea t Britain
 to keep our courage up
. And that™s about all I 
remember. 
Q: How long were you there? 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
14
A: I was there for about a year. 
Q: Okay . So , do Œ and you 
Œ you wrote to your mo the
r. How long did you Œ were 
you able to keep in co
ntact with your family? 
A: I really don™t remember, but I know in
 the beginning. Now, my  mo ther stayed 
in 
Germany
 because she didn™t have a Germ
an visa, she was born in Œ in 
Prague
, 
so she had a Czech visa. And there Œ it wasn
™t quite as rapid. And she eventually, 
she tried to pack up our Œ all our house, 
and our paintings, our
 Œ all our belongings 
to send to the 
United States
, and of course nothing 
was ever delivered. My 
parents lost everything. But she left to go to 
It a l y
 where my matern al grandparents 
had a house, which she inherited. So she went to 
Italy 
on the pretense of going to 
sell that house, and she never left 
Italy
. And she then went through 
Portugal
 in 
September of 1940 and came directly to the 
United States
. So I hadn™t seen her 
for a year and a half. 

Q: Where was your father? I know he said
 Œ you Œ he got a visa. Did he Œ where 
did he leave to? 

A: He left, and came through 
Switze rland
 to 
Harrow
. He lived in a boarding 
house in 
Harrow
, so he and my brother did see each
 other while they were there. 
Q: Did you Œ did Œ yo
u didn™t see your father though, at all? 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
15
A: I saw him once, the one time that I went to 
Ha rro w
. And then in April or May 
of 1940, my  brother, my  si
ster, I and my father all 
came over by boat on th e 
Britannic
 to the 
United Sta tes
. And my father had a research fellowship in 
Ypsilanti
, 
Michigan
, because he couldn™t practice me
dicine yet. And th en a year 
later he passed the me dical exam and then  he moved to 
Massachusetts 
with us. 
And the reason we went to 
Massachusetts
 is there were very few states where you 
could practice medicin e without being a citizen, and 
Massachusetts
 was one of 
them. So we moved to 
Braintree
, 
Massachusetts
, which is just outside 
Bo sto n
, 
and he started his practice again, and afte
r a beginning struggle, he became very 
successful and ev entually taught at 
Tufts Medical School
, and put all three o f us 
through college. 
Q: That™s fabulous. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So what year was it th
at you immigrated to the 
U
.
S
.? 
A: ™39. 

Q: ™39, okay. 

A: No, 1940 we emigrated. We left 
Germany
 in ™39, left 
England
 in 1940. 
Q: That™s wonderful. Okay
, so what about Œ did you 
still have grandparents who 
were Œ 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
16
A: Yes, my maternal g randparents had 
died early in the 30s, but my paternal 
grandparents, my  grandfather was also a physician, they lived in 
Ulm
. And it 
wasn™t until 1942 that they were sent out of 
Ulm
. They were told 
they were going 
to a Jewish retirement settle
ment, they couldn™t pack ve
ry much. And they were 
sent to 
Theresienstadt
, and they died in 
Theresienstadt
 within a week of each 
other in January of 1943. Now, my pare
nts didn™t know that until after the war. 
My parents tried to get them out of 
Germany
 and couldn™t. And so it wasn™t until 
after war that my father found out
 that my grandp
arents had died. 
Q: So, your Œ your brothers
 and sis Œ your brother a
nd sister, did they have a 
positive experience when
 they were in 
England
? 
A: Yes, they did. My brother in 
Ha rro w
, his family was as wonderful, and in fact, 
his foster mother even
tually came to the 
United States
, because his Œ their 
daughter eventually married
 an American serviceman
, and th en brought her 
mother over to the 
United States
. My sister™s family al
so was very nice to her, 
except in the beginning. My si
ster at that time was 14, and they so rt of treated her 
as a au pair, a househ old helper. And it 
Œ that didn™t stop until a cousin  of my 
father™s from 
India
 came to visit and explained to
 them that, you know, she had 
been brought up in 
a very privileged househ old, and th at she shouldn™t be treated 
like a servant. And everything was fine 
from then on, an d you know, she was quite 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
17
happy, I™m sure. Although, sh
e was 14, and that™s not a Œ an easy ag e to, you 
know, uproot. But one of the children 
of that family did visit us in 
Massachusetts
 
when I was in college. I remember he came Œ
 Aubrey
 came to visit. But my sister 
hasn™t kept in touch with them, and my  br
other really didn™t keep in touch with his 
either.  
Q: So before we move on, I want to talk about your life in the 
U
.
S
. You had a 
photograph of a fr Œ a friend of yours, 
Ursula
. Was that someone you knew in  
England
? 
A: Yes, my best friend from 
Germany  
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: Œ was named 
Ursula Meyer
. And I did visit her in 
England
 once. I don™t know 
where, all I know is it was near th
e ocean somewhere because there is a 
photograph of the two of us on the beach
 in bathing su its. And I don™t know what 
ever happened to her, we lo
st touch when I came to the 
United States
. And I was 
just curious to see whether she was stil
l alive, and whether she had stayed in 
England
, or whether she got married, or what
, I had no idea. And I first got in 
touch with the 
Kindertransport Association
, to find out wh ether they could find 
her on a list anywhere. And they did find an 
Ursula  Meyer
, but it was a m Œ a 
married name, not her m Œ her maiden name. 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter

Q: Oh, okay. So  how old 
were you wh en Œ wh en you immigrated to the 
U
.
S
.? 
A: I was nine. 
Q: Nine, okay, so did you s-start at
tending American school right away? 
A: Oh, when  I was s Œ came to the 
United States
, I was 10. Yes, I Œ I first went to 
school in 
New Yo rk City  
for a few weeks, until my 
father got the research 
fellowship in 
Michigan
. And then I went to 
elementary school in 
Michigan 
fo r a 
year. And then I Œ we moved to  
Braintree
, and I skipped a grade, because they 
said I™d had so much education in 
Germany
 and 
England
 that I was ready for the 
eighth grade, I should really 
have been in seventh. And then I stayed , I went all 
through high school in 
Braintree
. 
Q: So, was it difficult adjusting to, I mean
, a n ew lifestyle, after being in eng Œ 
Germany
 and then  
England
 Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ then  
America
. 
A: Not for me, I Œ I Œ you know, I rememb
er my  childhood as being a very happy 
childhood and I guess I was always happy 
from the time I was young, and I don™t 

remember really, any traumatic in cide
nces at all, except for one in 
England
, 
which I considered trauma
tic. My mother, when she 
was still able to send me 
packages from 
Germany
 had sent me a box of cherries from our 
Bing
 cherry tree

in 
Stuttgart
. And one night we were to take a 
bath, and it was my turn to take a 
bath first. And the bathroom was quite ch
illy, but there was a nice little cabinet or 
closet where the hot water heater was, 
and it was quite warm in there, and you 
usually dried yourself in there. And I was 
in there drying my self when I heard one 
of the twins come up fo r her bath . And I thought that it was 
Kathleen
, who was 
the very outgoing twin, and I thought, now 
wouldn™t it be fun to close the cabinet 
door and then open it and su ddenly  say boo. Well, I had made a mi stake and it was 
not 
Ka th leen
, it was 
Joyce
, who was a little more nerv
ous. And of course, she 
cried and sh rieked and Uncle 
Co rnish
(ph), my foster father, 
sent me to my room 
for what I considered just fun, but appare
ntly he was concerned because one of the 
twins was crying. So I remember sitting 
on my bed on my beautiful new quilt, 
opening my box of cherries, and I at
e every cherry one by one and I kept 
muttering to myself, and you won™t have 
any, I will eat them all by myself. And 
then in 1980
, when I went back to 
England 
for my foster mother™s 80
th
 birthday, I 
told him the story and he couldn™t reme mb
er it at all. But that™s about the only 
traumatic experience I had. An
d the only other one was in 
New York
, when I was 
in school for a few weeks. I remember 
standing up at my desk to  answer a 

question, and the little boy be
hind me was measuring the length of my dress with a 
ruler. And apparently my German dresses 
had gotten a little short as I got a year

20
older, and I reme mb er him measuring the le
ngth of my  skirt. But that™s about the 
only traumatic experiences. 
Q: Did you exchange a lot of letters a
nd pack aged with you
r mother when you 
were in 
England
 and sh e was in 
Germany
? 
A: No, I really don™t remember. I mean, sh
e packed  everything in my  trunk, you 
know, that she thought I might want to have, like my  
Teddy
 bear and my books, 
and I don™t remember too many other letters from her. 
Q: Were your parents able to get anything out of 
Germany
 w h en  Œ  w h en  th ey  
left? 
A: No, no, nothing, nothing. 
Q: Do you reme mb er hearing ab out th
e war ending wh en you were in the 
U
.
S
.? 
A: Oh yes, and I Œ I distinctly rememb er 
Roosev elt™s 
death, because that came 
over the radio and I rememb er how shocke
d my  parents were when  they heard 
that. I was actually on Œ on 
Ca pe Cod
 when World War II e
nded, and I heard over 
the radio, and we all celebrated. 
Q: That™s wonderful. So, let™
s se e, what else  we have to
 talk about. Have Œ have 
you ever done an interview like this before? 
A: No.

Q: Have you ever Œ 
do you talk to your Œ have you talked to
 your ch ildren Œ how 
many children do you have? 
A: I have tw o daughters, and 
I have five grandchildren. 
Q: Okay , whe-when 
did you get married? 
A: I got married what at that time was c
onsidered late in life. I was 2 7  and my 
husband was 31 and in those days, in 1956 th
at was considered ov
er the hill. Most 
of my college friends were already moth
ers. But I got married in 1956 and I got 
married at the 
Harvard 
chapel, wh ich solv ed all of the religious problems Œ my  
husband was Jewish. And anyone who went to 
Harvard
, which I did, and he went 
to the 
Ha rva r d  
Business School, was able to get married at the 
Harvard 
chapel, 
so that™s where we got marri
ed and it solved all the prob
lems of who was going to 
marry us, and how, and what
, and everybody was happy. 
Q: That™s good. Okay, so I guess we Œ 
we should back  up. 
So  you went Œ you 
went to 
Harvard
. 
A: Yes. 
Q: What did you study? 

A: I majored in English and American literature. 
Q: Cool, and your Œ and did you meet your husband at 
Harvard
? 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
22
A: No, no. He actually went to the busine
ss school after I graduated. He work ed 
for a few years before he went to graduate
 school. So  I graduated in 1950, and this 
year was my 60
th
 reunion. 
Q: Oh really? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you attend it? 

A: Yes, it was wonderful. 
Q: That™s wonderful. 
A: It was a great reunion. 

Q: So, and you have tw o daugh
ters and five grandchildre
n, and d Œ ha
ve you ev er 
talked to them about your experien ces? 

A: Well, I™ve talked to my d Œ my daught
ers, you know, about it, and a little bit to 

my grandchildren. But that™s really why 
I wro t e my  me mo ir, so
 that they would 
know. And you know, what they
 know about the Holocaust 
they read in Œ in their 
history textbooks, and they
 know what happened
 politically, but I don™t think they 
ever fully realized how it 
affects individuals. And I 
thought they  should know how 
it affected my family, and 
what happened to  me when I was nine years old. And 
that™s really why I wrote the memoir. And 
my  husband kept insisting that I should 
write that and Œ for the gr
andchildren, primarily. 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
23
Q: I think it™s important. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So it™s good that you did that. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And it™s also good th at you™re sharing y
our story with us today, so thank you. 
A: Well, thank yo
u, thank you. 
Q: Do you think that y
our experien ces with the 
Kindertransport 
affected maybe 
especially the way that you raised your children? 

A: I don™t think so. I mean, they™ve alwa
ys known wh at it was like fo Œ you know, 
when  I was a child from what I told them, 
but I don™t think it really affected them. 
As I said, my  husband was Jewish, but he 
also did not practice 
his religion really, 
after he was in his 20s. And so we did 
a little bit of everything, you know. We 
practiced some Jewish holidays because hi
s side of the family did practice them. 
But we also practiced Christma
s, which is what my  side of the fami ly did, and so I 
think I™ve tried to make them non-prejudi
ced, and Œ and, you know, have respect 
for all relig ions and all races. But other than
 that, I don™t think it really influenced 
my  raising my  children in any way. 
Q: Did you ever speak to your parents 
about maybe wh at they were going th rough 
w h en  th ey  Œ 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
24
A: Not really. My father, for 
example, never talked about 
Da cha u
 and we never 
asked him. And it wasn™t until he wrote a ve
ry small autobiography in 1972 that I 
learned a little bit about his experiences in 
Dachau
. And I know he told me in that 
autobiography that two other people from 
Stuttgart
 that were sent to 
Da cha u
 with 
him, died. One, because he was a diabetic
 and was not given insu lin, and the other 
from some kind of intestin
al infection. And as I sa
id, my father suffered from 
some kind of sinus problems which had to
 have surgery once he got out of th e 
hospital Œ I mean, out of 
Da cha u
 and he went to the hospital in 
Stuttgart
, before 
he went to  
Switzerland
. 
Q: Does your mother ever ta lk about when she was in 
Germany
 alone, about what 
she was experiencing? 
A: Not really. We really didn™t talk very
 mu ch about it. And it was just there, you 
know, we knew that that™s what we ha
d gone through. And th e only thing Œ you 
asked wh ether my  parents were able to save anything. The only thing th at they 
were able to save Œ and this is a Œ a rath
er unique story, a go
od friend of theirs was 
Emma Goering
, who was a distant cousin  of 
Goering™s
, who was, of course, one 
of the biggest Nazis. S h e was very anti-N
azi, and very outspoken, but they never 
arrested her or bothered here, I guess be
cause  she was rel ated to him. But she was 
a good friend of my  parents. And when  my
 mo ther was getting everything ready, 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
25
packed to go to the 
United States
, you were not supposed to take any jewelry or 
silver, you had to declare th
at and give it to the government. Well, my  mo ther 
didn't  want to do that. And 
Emma Goering
 suggested that she 
Œ my  mo ther give it 
to her and she would bury it in her garden
, in  a box, wh ich she did. And during the 
war, my brother was in the army for four 
years, and toward the end he was on a 
leave, and he went to  visit 
Emma Goering
, to see if sh e was still al-alive. And 
Emma Goering
 said to him, I have something 
th at belongs to your mo ther. And 
they went into her gard en, dug up th
e box, and because he was already a 
U
.
S
. 
citizen and a serviceman, he 
was allowed to send it to the 
United States
. So my 
mother got back all of the jewelry that 
she had inherited from her grandmother and 
great-grandmother, her German silverwa
re. And then several years later 
Emma 
Goering
 visited my  husband and me in 
New York City
, and she was a charmin g , 
charming lady. And so that™s the only 
thing my  parents did save, and it was 
because of her. 
Q: That™s an incredible story. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So, your brother was in th
e army during World War II? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay , so 
when you Œ 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
26
A: He was in 
Patton™s 
army for four years. 
Q: Oh, so when  you immigrat
ed, he mu st have joined  the army  right away, or Œ 
A: Well, he Œ no, he Œ he was Œ wh
en we immigrated, he was 13 Œ 14 Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: He went to high school in 
Michigan
. And then he had star
ted the University of 
Michigan
 when  he was drafted, and then  he 
went in the army, and he was in the 
army for four years. 
Q: Wow. That™s incredible. That™s grea
t that sh-he Œ she was able to save Œ 
A: Yes, yeah. 
Q: That™s amazing. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So, is there anything else that yo
u Œ you would like to
 add? Any other Œ 
A: Well, it™s just that I Œ 
I guess I was a Œ a very, ve
ry lucky child, because my 

English foster family was just Œ just wond erful. And as I said, I saw them again in 
1980 for my foster mother™s 80
th
 birthday. And th en I went back to 
England
 in 
2008 for the twins™ 80
th
 birthday party. And they were
 just so compassionate and 
loving, and so was Mrs. 
Emerson
. And it taught me a good lesson, that 
comp assion and friendliness and love and 
just being good people
 is important, and 
I™ve tried to teach th
at to my children. 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
27
Q: So you™ve returned to 
England
 twice? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Have you ever been back to 
Germany
? 
A: Yes, I went back to 
Germany
 first in 1951 with my
 sister, we went to 
Europe
 
for three months. And we
 visited our house in 
Stuttgart
, and then  I went back  
again in 1982, to visit my  German cousin
s on my mother™s side of the family, 
whom I hadn™t seen until the mid-30s. Andwe™ve become very close friends and 
so we™ve gone back to 
Europe 
two or three times for birthdays
 
and travel, and Œ 
with them. And so I™ve been 
back , yes. And when  I went back in 1982, we went to 
Stuttgart
, and the people who owne
d my  parents™ house took my  husband an d me 
through it, to show us what it was like. 
Q: Was it different? 

A: And then Œ not really. Apparently it 
was damaged a little bit during the war, but 
not badly. And the interesti
ng thing is, as we were leaving, a wo man next door 
leaned over the fence and said, 
Erica
, what are you doing here? In German. And it 
turns out that she was my si
ster™ s friend. She was my si
ster™s age, and for some 
reason she recognized me after all those 
years. And so I explained to her what 
happened  to  us. And so  we did see the house in 1982. 

Q: Did you speak German at home w
ith your family after the war? 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
28
A: Not really, no. I thi
nk once we came to the 
United States
 and my father 
decided we were now going to  be Ameri
cans, and you know, we really didn™t 
speak much German. But I 
can still speak it, and I 
speak it with a strong 
[indecipherable]
 accent, and I can understand mo
st German. I can™t understand 
legal German or technical German, but I can read German. 
Q: Mm-hm, that™s wonderful. So , if Œ if
 there™s anything else that you would like 
to add? 
A: No, I™m just, you know, as I said, I wa s very lucky, I had a wonderful English 
family. I know not ev eryone was as lucky 
as I was. And we™ve stayed very close 
friends, and I™ve just recogni
zed how Œ wh at a big sacrif
ice it was fo r these people, 
because they didn™t know whet
her they were going to ha
ve us for a month or a 
year or forever. I know there are some 
Kindertransport
 children who™ve been  
there, you know, were there for seven, eigh
t, nine years. And I was only there for a 
year. But both families were ju
st wonderful to us, really. 
Q: That™s good. 

A: And they  Œ be Œ ma Œ my  English fo
ster family remained
 friends with my 
parents and came to 
visit them in the 
United States
. And then my  parents visited 
them in 
England
, too. 
Q: That™s wonderful. 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
29
A: So, it was a nice relationship. 
Q: Before we wrap things up, I™m curi
ous, are the photos that you brought, are 
they pictures from Œ from your childhood? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Maybe let™s look at them real quick an
d we™ll kind of talk about them together. 

A: Yes, sure, yeah, come and sit. 

Q: I™ll come sit next to you. 
A: Well, in the beginning, I have pictures 
of my  father and my  uncle and my  aunt, 
and those have interesting stories. My
 uncle, who was an entomologist, left 
Germany
 in 1933, went first to 
Palestine 
for a few years, then to 
Venezuela
, and 
eventually ended up in 
Mexico City
, where he became a prof
essor at University of 
Mexico
, as an entomo logist. My aunt, whose husband had factories that 
manufactured felt for printing in  both 
Germ any
 and 
Italy
, left in 1936 and moved 
to 
Italy
, and a farmer hid him as
 a farm helper during th
e war. And my  aunt and 
my  three cousins were saved by Italian 
nuns, who took them to a nunnery . So  
anyway, these are pictures of my father, a
nd these are pictures of my mother in her 
childhood. 

Q: Oh wow, that™s a w o nderful photo. 

 
Interview with Erica Kanter  
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
30
A: Yeah, and sh e, you know, really grew
 up sort of like a debutante. And then, 
these are the pictures of my grandparents, Dr.
 Ludwig
, and 
[indecipherable]
 
Hecht
. And they are the ones who died in 
Theresienstadt
 in 1943. And the reason 
I know that they didn™t go th
ere until 1942, late in the ye
ar was that there™s a letter 
from them to my cousin in 
Italy
, saying that they were go
ing to have to leave in 
August of 1942. And then it wasn™t til after 
the war that we found out that they had 
died, but here™s a picture of them. 
Q: Did th ey s Œ did they  stay in 
Ulm
 until this? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Oh wow. 
A: Yes, they stayed in 
Ulm
 until then. And these are my
 maternal grandparents, 
who died  early in the 30s. And they™re 
the ones who had the Œ the estate in 
Czechoslovakia
 where I st-stayed every summe
r until I was probably seven or 
eight. And here, this is pictures of 
Stuttgart
, where I grew up. And this is our 
house and there are my brother and sister. Th
at™s me at the age of three. And there 
are my  brother and I with our 
Steiff Teddy
 bears, who had a webbing. 
Q: Oh, that™s precious.

they were called. And here Œ when I was 
little. And here my school friends, and here™s 
Ursula Meyer
, my best friend. 
Q: Oh wow, look how lo

A: Yes, oh, she had lo Œ and big, blue 
eyes, she was very, very pretty. And then, 
this is the castle that 
my gran dparents had in Œ 
Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: Œ in 
Cze choslovakia
, where I went every summer. A nd there I am, and here 
I™m learning how to  ride a bike. And he
re™s my  grandfather taking a nap after 
lunch. And this was our cook in 
Germa ny
, who used to come
 with us in the 
summer to help. And here™s our nanny, or
 au pair. And these are relatives who 
were visiting. And here 
we are outdoor bowling. And this is all in Œ in 
Czechoslovakia
. And this place is also a religions 
shrine, so this is Œ this was how 
it fell apart in the 90s, and th
is is how it™s now renovated. 
Q: Wow. 
A: And it™s still a Œ considered a religious
 shrine. These are paintings that my 

brother did when he was little. Then here™s
 another picture Œ oh
, here™s my English 
foster family,

work at home the rest of 
the time Œ 
Q: Oh, nice. 
A: Œ which was very unusual in the late 
50s, early 60s. Bu t I did that for 13 years,

Q: Where were you wo rking? 

A: At

book, I have pictures of my  five grandc
hildren, to whom this book is dedicated 
and let™s see where they are. Here. This 
is the oldest, he™s now 21, from the time 
he was little until now. And here™s the next
 one, who™s 20, and now. And here™s 
the next one, who is just turned 18, and 
now. And this is my granddaughter, who is 
the gymnast, she became a junior Olympian
 last year, she™s 
amazing, and now. 
And the youngest, who™
s 14, th en and now. 
Q: Four boys and one girl. 
A: Yes, four boys and 
one girl. And th is is a 
picture of my  husband Œ 
Q: Wonderful. 
A: Œ with out whom this book would not 
have been possible. He™s t h e one who 
kept insisting I write it and then  many, ma
ny of these photographs are photographs 
that he took, he was a very good photogr
apher. Anyway, that™s what this book is. 
Q: Well, it™s wonderful. 

A: And it™s called, ﬁ
The Road I™ve Traveled: Its Ruts and Rainbows
.ﬂ And 
that™s me at the age of three. 

Q: Oh, th at is a wonderful photograph. 

A: And this is my  1939 passport photograph. 
Q: Oh adorable, th
at™s wonderful. 
A: And this is a picture of my  husban
d in his usual pose with his camera.

Q: With the camera up to his eye. 
A: Yeah, always with th at 
Nikon
 around his neck. Anyway, 
that™s what this book 
is, and these are the pages on which the 
grandparents who died, and my  English 
families are. So that™s what it is. 

Q: It™s wonderful that you 
know, you would be able to
 capture so many memo ries 
in photograph, but also to be able
 to write that all down in a book. 
A: Yeah, well, I put in all the photographs b
ecause fir Œ first of all, in a sense, all 
these photographs are my husband™s legacy 
to his gran dchildren. And also because 
I knew th at the grandsons probably  wouldn™t
 read it for a while, but I wanted them 
to be able to see it, as well as read ab
out it, and experience my  life in, you know, a 
different way than ju st reading about it. 

Q: Well, I™m sure it™s something 
that they will 
cherish, so Œ 
A: Yeah, I hope so. 

Q: Is there anything else
