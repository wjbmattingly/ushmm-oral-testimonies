A: Well, we were privileged, I think. I wa
s privileged in many ways because the time of 
the 
Romania
 was, after first World War, and the 
economic situation was good, and my  
father busin ess was good, so I didn™t have to wo
rk. So th-the on
ly thing I had to do is to 
go to  school. 

Q: And what sort of a Œ did you live in 
an apartment, did you live in a house? 
A: No, we only lived 
in an apartment. 
Q: Uh-huh. A-An ap artment that your pare
nts owned, or that they just rented? 
A: No, rented. 

Q: Was it a big one? Did you have
 your own room, for instance? 
A: When I was an adolescent, yes. That™s 
another one, we had the Œ I had the Œ my  own 
room wh ere I could study, you see. There was a lot of studying in th e high school in 

Romania 
th at time. And of course we had to lear
n lots of foreign languages. We learned 
French in school, then
 the Italian in school, and th en
 privately I learned English. 
Q: And why did you privately learn English?
 Why was Œ did your parents think this was 
an important thing to do? 

A: Well, because if Œ the idea was Œ 
part of it was that when you Œ in 
Ro ma nia
, if you 
leave there, and you are a s-sp
ecialist, either you are an e
ngineer or an architect, or a 
docto r, you have to travel. So if you have 
to  travel, you have to know languages. 
Q: So did you become fluent
 in French and Italian Œ 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici

A: Now Œ 
Q: Yeah? 

A: In French I had to become fluent, because 
there was an exam in 
French. You see, th Œ 
we have the Œ they had the high school in 
Romania
 is like in 
France
, you have to pass 
the baccalaureate, you know. And 
there is an exam in French
, and the French teacher is 
talking you in French. 
But th-the Œ talks about literature, 
and what else? And so I Œ I took 
some lesso n in conversation in French. 
Q: And what about your Italian, 
was there an exam in Italian? 
A: Italian, no, no, th ere was no 
examination in Italian, you know
, just is a Œ I didn™t want 
to take German. Most students took Germ
ans, but I Œ I didn™t like the German. 
Q: And how come? 
A: Because of 
Hitler
. 
Q: I see, so  you were very conscious Œ 

A: Oh yes. 
Q: Œ once you became a Œ a Œ 
A: Oh yeah, we were very conscious when  
I was in high school. Let me say this about 
this. In 
Romania
, there were at least two political pa
rty that was very Œ that were very 
anti-Semitic. And when you we
re growing up in high school, and reading the newspaper, 
you were aw are that there was a certai
n amount of anti-Semitism all the time.

Q: Mm-hm. Wer Œ did you have non-Jewish frie
nds as well as Jewish 
friends in Œ in high 
school, or was this ma inly a Jewish school? 
A: No, I went to high school, a state high sc
hool, wh ich was in Œ mo re or less in the 
Jewish district of town. And ma Œ ther Œ abou
t half of the class was Jewish, half of the 
class was n o t Jewish. But we had Je
wish friends. I had Jewish friends. 
Q: You had Jewish friends, as well as Œ 

A: Not Œ 
Q: Œ not Jew Œ non-Jewish friends. 
A: Well, we had one guy th at we played 
so ccer with, that was not Jewish, maybe. 
Q: But mo stly you had Jewish friends. 
A: Jewish friends, right. 
Q: Were Œ were your parents religiou
s? Was your home a religious home? 
A: No. 

Q: It wasn™t. 
A: They were not religious. Ex
cept that my father used to 
go to  the synagogue primarily 
for what they used to call 
yutzat
(ph) you know, for Œ 
Q: Mm-h m, me mo rial.  

A: Œ for memorial things, yeah, for his mother 
and father or something. He used to go to

Q: To 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ high holidays, no, no. 
Q: So you didn™t go to
 synagogue growing up? 
A: I had a Bar Mitzvah. 
Q: You did? Did that seem odd to
 you, given that your parent
s were not very  religious, or 
did that seem Œ 

A: Well, let me say this about it. Accordin
g to the Romanian cons
titution, in high school 
Œ you see, the high school was not like here
, e v erybody goes to the high school. You had 
to take an exam to get in the high sc
hool, it wasn™t compulsory high school. And 
according to the constitution, every student had 
to have religious education. There was a 
mark for religious education, y
ou had to be in the 
class. And I took Jewish religion in the 
high school. We had the rabbi wh
o came in and talked to us. 
Q: So were you required to 
Œ to  be the religion of your parents, or could you have 
decided to  go to  another class altogether? 
A: No, no, you Œ 
Q: You had to do it. 

A: You have to do a religion. Of course, I was 
Jewish, so I Œ so I-I Œ I 
went to the Œ to the 
special classes, the rab b i who came in. 

Q: Right, right.

A: And then the rabbi was invo
lved with the Œ I think it was 
Œ not an Orthodox, Reform Œ 
Q: The Reform movement. 
A: Œ Reform synagogue, and then I took 
the Bar Mitzvah in the Reform synagogue. 
Q: I see. But the Bar Mitzvah was not required, right? 

A: No, no, it was not required. 

Q: No, you Œ did you decide yo
u wanted to  do it, or did 
your parents decide, do you 
think? 
A: No. I don™t know, everybody
 was doing it, so I did it. 
Q: So you did it. Was there a party? 
A: No party. 
Q: No party, you ju st did the Bar Mitzvah. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you like it? Did y Œ was Œ were you Œ 

A: Well, I took lessons again. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Some Hebrew lessons, some you ha Œ also in the Bar Mitzvah, you had to  give a little 

talk, mostly to thank your parents fo
r what they did fo r you and so  on. 
Q: Right. 

A: So I learned a Œ a Hebrew little talk 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
10
Q: Uh-huh. In Hebrew? 
A: In Hebrew. 

Q: Ah. And who translated it for you? Di
d you Œ did you write
 it in Romanian? 
A: Oh no, no, I took Hebrew lessons. 

Q: Oh, so you could do it. 

A: Yeah. Not only that, but du
ring the Bar Mitzvah, we were
 four students, and you had 
to go to the Torah and I think that
 we read a little of the Torah aloud. 
Q: I see. Right. 
A: So you had to learn the 
Œ how to read the script. 
Q: The script from that Torah, right. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So what kind of a child 
were you? Were you very se
rious? Were you a problem for 
your parents, what were Œ look at that look on your face. 

A: I Œ I don™t know. I think that the influe
n ce o f  my  mo ther was th at Œ  you  see, my  
parents didn™t have an  education. So I had to 
have an education an d I had to be what they  

used to call the liberal professi
on. Which mean either a lawyer or a doctor or an  engineer 
or something, you know. And there wa
s a certain pressure to become a Œ  
Q: A professional. 

A: A professional, right.

11
Q: Were Œ did you resent it? 
A: No. 

Q: No, you didn™t. This was okay with you. 
A: No, no, no. Well, again, we 
were lucky, we didn™t have 
to work. And the only thing, 
when I was in high school, I did a fair 
amount of sports, a
nd you had to pass an 
examination, you know. 
Q: Right. So  wh at sports did you like? 
A: We played soccer. 
Q: Uh-huh. And you liked that? 

A: We played soccer when we were 13 - 14
, and then later on we played volleyball and 
basketball. 

Q: And basketball? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And your brother, your
 brother was younger? 
A: Five years younger. 

Q: Five years, oh, that™s a big difference.

Interview with Harry Iticovici

12
A: Well, when he became older, we already ha
d the problem with Œ with th e Jews and he 
couldn™t go to the regular state school. And 
he had to go to a Jewish school. And Œ 
Q: This is even befo
re high school, yeah. 
A: No, in high school. 
Q: In high school. 

A: In high school. 

Q: I see. 
A: He couldn™t go to th e regular school, th
e ji Œ state school. You see, i-it was very 
important to go to state school, to be ab
le to pass that Œ the examination, the 
baccalaureate, because that gives you rights to 
go to university and be
come an officer in 
the army and so on. The baccalaureate was ve
ry important in the Œ 
in the Œ with the Œ 
with the numerous 
[indecipherable] 
you know, and they  started saying that the Jews 
cannot go to the state school, so the Jews
 formed their own high schools. Now, I 
understand from 
Radu
 that later on they recognized those schools, you see, after the war, 
you see, in the Œ they  went back  Œ my  brot
her went back to the 
regular state school. 
Q: I see. B u t that was after the war. 

A: After the war, yes. 
Q: So, in 1933, when 
Hitler
 takes over, you™re 11 years old,
 are you very  conscious that 
Œ that Œ I mean, is there an affect in 
Ro ma nia
 at this time? 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
13
A: A li Œ a little Œ as I said again, there were 
all the time, I was very conscious that there 
was a certain amount of an
ti-Semitism in the Œ in the 
Œ Romania
, you know? 
Q: So you grew up with that? 
A: Oh yes, no question about it. 
Q: Did you join Jewish Œ any 
Jewish groups at the time? 
A: I Œ I was Œ only for a short time when we Œ we used to play bask etball and volleyball Œ 

well, that was later on, I was member of the 
Maccabee
, that was a sports group, Jewish 
sports group. 

Q: So you didn™t join a Zioni
st political party or anything Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ or a group. 
A: Now I had friends, my friends that I used 
to play so ccer in th
e street when I was 
young, later on they joined the 
Betar
, and they were on 
Struma
. 
Q: Uh-huh. And they were killed. 
A: Killed, right. 
Q: Mm-hm. So you get your baccalaureate, is it 1940? 

A: Right. 
Q: And your Œ so you™re 18. 
A: Right. 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
14
Q: Right. And Œ and by then there Œ 
there is a clear Nazi influence in 
Romania
, is that 
right? 
A: Well, it started Œ this is
 probably Œ you see, there wa
s a lot of resentment in 
Romania
 
in the Œ because 
Poland
 was divided in 1939,
 you know. And the we
stern powers didn™t 
interfere. And the king felt that
 he cannot rely on the wester
n power, so he made the 
compromise and let the Germ
ans come in. And he also made another comp romise, 
because he appointed the gove
rnment wi-with these anti-Semitic g roups. And the Œ the 
influence of Germans, and the in
fluence of the government, they started this that the Jews 
cannot have business, the Jews cannot go 
to universities, and so
 on and so forth. 
Q: Wa-Was there also  some la
w against citizen
ship for Jews? 
A: That™s right. 

Q: So did you lo se your citizenship? 

A: Now, no. 

Q: No, okay. 
A: Now let me tell you about this
. There were a number of laws in 
Romania
 that allowed 
the Jews to become citizens. 
In the Œ my father was a sold
ier in the World War I, and he 
got a citizenship because of that
. But then they Œ they withdr
ew it, or they review it or 
something and he had to go to
 court again to get it back. 
Q: And did he get it back? 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
15
A: I think so , yes. 
Q: So did th at make you safer? 

A: No. 
Q: It didn™t. 
A: No, because when 
they introduce this 
[indecipherable]
 and it seems that you could 
not be Œ have a busin ess on y
our name, or you cannot go 
to state run school, or you 
cannot go to universities. Wa
s a matter of religion, not 
of Œ of citizenship. See Œ 
Q: I see. 

A: Œ because you see, when  the things got ba
d, everybody got the passport, you see, and a 
Œ and wh er Œ I got Œ I had a Romanian passport,
 my parents, especially my father, didn™t 
want to leave. 

Q: Oh, he didn™t? 

A: No. He was not a 
[indeciphera ble]
 and he was in the war in 
Romania
 and he felt that 
his place is to stay in 
Ro ma nia
. 
Q: But he couldn™t have his business 
any more, is that co rrect, or not? 
A: He Œ I don™t remember what
 happened with that. Most Je
ws in business, what they 
did, they  had the 
nom de plume
, you know what I mean? Just
 a Christian guy name, and 
they were running 
the business, see? 
Q: I see. 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
16
A: But I don™t know whether he did that
 or not, I Œ I didn™t hear about it. 
Q: I see. Well, how Œ how did it co
me Œ it must have been awful in 
Romania
 at the time. 
Were you Œ were you, before you left, in some sort of a camp? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: During Œ was this during th e day, 
or you were sleeping there as well? 
A: No, I was during the day in a big camp called 
[indecipherable]
. Was a camp with 
thousands of Jewish adolescents, and we we
re building so me target Œ you know, mounds 
of earth on both sides, so that the soldie r can shoot targets, you see. And there is no 
equipment to bring the earth up to make this 
[indeciphera ble]
 you see. 
Q: So you were digging. 
A: So you had two guys
, a different level, moving earth. 
There was a tool Œ I don™t know 
what you call that in English, I don
™t know what you call it in eng Œ 
Q: Not a shovel? 
A: Shovel, right, yeah. 
Q: A shovel. There were Œ th
ere were no girls in this Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ there was just adolescent boys. 
A: There were only 
[indecipherable]
 boys. This happened afte

A: ‚41 
Q: ™41. 

A: I spend th e whole summer in Œ in that camp. 
Q: Was that horrible? 
A: Well, I got sick there twice. They had 
detachment, and th e detachment was run by a 
lieutenant and th e sergeant and I had Œ 
I had no trouble with them, you know. 
Q: Uh-huh. And did they feed you? 
A: No. 
Q: No fo od at all during the whole day? 

A: You had to bring your own fo od, and Œ but
 you could go home in
 the evening, you 
know. 

Q: I see. So Œ so did everybody eat at the 
same time when they br
ought fo od? Did Œ was 
there a break, or you just ate when you Œ 

A: No, no, I Œ I Œ I don™t rememb er exactly, I 
think th at there was a period of rest, so to 
speak, you know, I mean. 

Q: Uh-huh. And then  you we
nt home in the evening. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And were you in two camp s? 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici

18
A: I was in one camp, and they  discharged
 us from the camp because the weather you 
know, snow and s Œ and th en, during the winte
r, they called us back because th ey wanted 
the Œ the parks cleaned up of sn
ow for traffic or something. 
Q: Right. 

A: So we went for short time, 10 days only. 

Q: Right. So let me Œ when Œ 
did you make the deci
sion by yourself to leave, or did you 
talk with your parents? 
A: I wanted to leave, but I didn™t know how 
to  leave. And so wh at happened was that my  
Œ one of my father associates had a son, and 
he was apparently in 
this group that they 
were organizing this trip. And so my  father aske
d me if I want to go to those meetings, so 
I went to the meetings where 
they were organizing the trip. 
Q: I see. W e have to change tape
s, so hold the story for a mo ment.

Beginning Tape Two 
Q: So your f Œ your father as
ked whether you wanted to Œ to leave, or to go to th ese 
meetings. 
A: So I went to these meeting, and 
he fel Œ you see, this Œ the son of 
[indecipherable]
 
was an architect, and he was older than I was, you see, in the 30s, and I guess he felt that 
he is going to take care of me or
 help me, because I was just 19 Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ when the meeting started. 
Q: So how long did it take Œ you Œ you had 
decided befo rehand that you had wanted to 

leave somehow. 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: Right. And your father knew that. 

A: Well, you see, there was a problem where 
are you going to  go. And in  Œ in those days 
in 
Ro ma nia
 there was a very strong French  influenc
e, you see, and Œ and you Œ actually, 
in the Œ I was supposed to go on su mmer vaca
tion to one of those summer courses in Œ in 
France 
you see, but was cancelled because of th
e war, and you couldn™t go there. The 
only other place yo
u could go was 
Switzerla n d
, and the problem was with 
Switze rland
 
was that you had to deposit money in advance 
that you are going to have enough money 
to finish your school. So
, we didn™t do that.

Q: Were your Œ since your father didn™t want 
to go, was your mo th er and father upset that 
you wanted to leave? 
A: My moth er was Œ he Œ she 
felt that the Œ she was concerne
d that if I stay there, I™m 
going to  go in trouble. 

Q: Because you were going to get into tro
uble, or because the Germans are gonna do 
something Œ cause th-the German Œ 

A: No, no, I Œ I Œ I would Œ I 
Œ he wasn™t Œ in those days 
you are Œ you see, there was 
also something else that happened in 
Romania
. When 
Anto nescu 
became pri Œ pri Œ 
premier, he Œ and the king left, you see, ther
e was Œ he brought in the Iron Gu ards, which 
was an extremely radical group who was also 
anti-Semitic. And there were stories of the 
Iron Gu ards going in homes and picking up pe
ople in the streets and so on and so  forth, 
and my  mother was very c-concerned that I™m 
going to get in pogrom Œ in a pogrom, and 
she got Œ now, my father felt th
at if I leave, I™ll leave fore

Q: Cause she was worried. 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Yes. So what Œ what were
 these meetings like, that 
you Œ wh en you went to these 
meetings? 

A: Well, these meetings were primarily Œ my
 understanding about this was that these 
people, there were originally I think 10 or 
11 or something, they  
decided to buy a boat 
from a Greek person who built this boat as a sa
ilboat for races Œ racing. This was a racing 
sailboat. And I think he was in importing and ex
port of grain, th-the Greek guy. And they 
decided, th-that they are going 
to Œ to buy it, and so they we
re organizing the Œ they were 
talking, where are we going to  get the maps
, the boat head, a small engine. One of the 
guys was supposed to be a know
ledge of mechanic, and he was supposed  to take care of 
the engine. And then  wh ere are we go Œ th-the
 Œ wh at kind of luggage we can take, you 
know, we™re not supposed to 
take luggage because there wa
s no place, just socks, you 
see. And then there was a lot of talk about, if
 we leave in the winter or spring, the rail Œ 
you see, this boat Œ and this is why we had tr
ouble with, had a big mast with sails. And to 
keep the mast up you have to have a keel 
under Œ under the boat. And th e question was, 
how are you going to use the sail if in the wi
nter when the rail where the sail g o es up and 
down like a zipper is going to freeze, you see?  So they  were talking about all these 

things, you see?

th e different life, where Œ whe Œ wh ere Œ let

g Ro manian, he™s going to be interned, you 
know, being an enemy alien. And he took th
e little dinghy boat that we had, we had a 
little dinghy boat, and he went to the 
Chios Island
. Those islands Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ were occupied by the Germans, they
 were Greek islands, you know? And I think 
that one of the thing that he was supposed to
 do, because of the k
eel, was to throw in a 
gadget that it™s like a string with a weight, 
by which, before the boat goes in the harbor, 
he finds out the depths of th
e water. And we d Œ he wasn™t there to do that any more. I 
think that™s what he was doing Œ 
Q: I see. 
A: Œ befo re. And the captain should have aske
d one of th e guys to do th at, you see. And 
what happened is that the keel
, which was about three or Œ feet or four feet deep, went 
between rocks in the por Œ 
Çe
me
, and then the boat star
ted shaking like this, and 
everybody got scared and we le
ft the boat and we went on th e 
Turkish coast. And then we 
stayed there for, oh, I don™t know, maybe 10 ho
urs or something like this. And then there 
was a Turkish boat that rescue it. I mean, th
ey were Œ they had some long sticks and 
pushing the sticks to the bottom and at the 
same time the boat, pulling it, you know? So 
they got it out from the ro
 Œ between the rock s and 
in fla t ed
 it, and put it back on th e 
water, you know 
[indecipherable]
 water. Then we went back on the boat.

the Turks had Œ had a dinghy. 
Some people from the harbor 
came in with a dinghy. 

Q: I see. So then you were ju st s- si tting on th
e coast there. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Was there a town or were you on th e Œ just on the beach waiting? 
A: Yeah, just Œ just on the coast. 
Q: On the coast, just waiting. So
 th en you go back to th e boat? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Well then what happens? 
A: Then the saving Œ the saving
 boat took out the mast  a s 
a guarantee that they™re going 
to be paid  for their saving Œ salvage. 

Q: You mean this th Œ 
because they save you Œ 
A: Yeah.

 to come every day with a 
sack of food. I don™t know 
who paid for the food. This was near 
Smyrna

is a British consul 
in 
Smy-Smyrna

Anto nescu
, and the army  took control, and

they killed a few of the prime minister of 
Romania
. And of course, the-their leader was 
killed and buried, and th-the place where he
 was buried was covered with concrete, so 
that nobody can ta
ke his body out.

Romania

during th e war, you see. 
Q: Right, right.

A: So we Œ now, the boat was towed, it was ho
oked up to another boat, and then we went 
Œ it™s not far away, it™s about 60 miles, you see, we went to 
Cy prus 
in  
[indecipherable]
. 
And then everybody was put in
 some kind of a quarantine 
center, because they were 
afraid of diseases or something. And we st
ayed in quarantine ther
e, I don™t know, for a 
week or 10 days, or maybe 
a little longer, maybe longer. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And then they moved us to a hotel in 
Pedo las

A: Yeah, I played the role of
 a doctor there. So, it was a 
very active English teaching 
thing. 
Q: Right. Well, that™s interesting th
at the British would send a teacher, no? 
A: The British Œ the British have Œ I knew this
 before, because the British have the Œ I 
can™t remember the name of it, it™s called th
e British council or some
thing. They had an 
organization of teachers that were
 sent all over the world to te
ach English. This is before 
the war. I ge Œ I can™t reme Œ there 
was a lord involved
 in this, Lord 
Cecil
(ph), I think. I 
think this young man probably had something that
 he couldn™t be a soldier, or he couldn™t 
be an officer or something. And he was sent in to this 
[indecipherable]
 he was teaching 
English.  
Q: So you were Œ 
you were occupied? 
A: Yeah.

American university in 
Beirut
. Then to my surprise, the h
ealth officer Œ oh, wait, we Œ 
there was a 
Cyprus
 health officer around also. He cam
e to tell me that you are going to 
leave the colony. And that I wa
s admitted to Œ as a student in
 the American university in 
Beirut
, you see, and I left on the airplane, a small airplane.

over. 
Q: I see. I see. Did you also write to you
r parents and your brot
her? Or you didn™t? 
A: You couldn™t write. The only thing that I 
Œ I received through the war were certain 
letters from Œ small letters, really simple letters; we are w ell, and so on, from the Catholic 

Œ the Catholic Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 organization, you see, th
ey were doing this, they 
were sending let-letters, but I never answered 
them because I didn™t know how to do that. 
Q: So you didn™t hear from yo
ur parents and you didn™t Œ you Œ I mean, there was no way 
to communicate with them. 
A: Oh, they send me these little notes. 
Q: The Œ the little ones, but you don™t know Œ 
A: No. 

Q: Yeah. Were you worried about them? 

A: No. 
Q: You weren™t. You didn™t th
ink th ings would happen in 
Bucharest
? 
A: Well, I don™t know. I think the reaction, it
™s some kind of a psychological reaction that 
you wo rry about yourself, so you don™t have th
at mu ch worry about other people. I don™t 
know, I think it™s some kind of a selfish way to react.

A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. Bu t you didn™t know anybody th ere. 
A: In

Q: Mm. 

A: No. 
Q: So you took this plane,
 with your little sack of cl
othes and your dictionary Œ 
A: That™s right. 
Q: Œ and you went to the university an
d wh at were you going to study there? 
A: Well, I wrote them that I want to go to  
medical school, and th ey have a medical school 
with very  few students, you know, like 40 st
udents a year or something like this. And 
they wrote me that I Œ becau
se of my Œ the baccalaureat
e exam, you know, that I™ll be 
admitted to sophomore science. 
So I stayed there and took so
phomore science. And then I 
went to junior, and in junior you have to 
take a major, major in biology and a minor in 
chemistry to be able to go to medical school. 

Q: Mm-hm, right. 
A: And I was sick that year.

A: Yellow jaundice. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. Everybody got jaundice
 that year. The rumor was th
at the Indian troops from, 
you remember 
Rommel
, and the Indian troops from 
Africa
? Came in for reha Œ or rehab 
or something, and they bro
ught with them hepatitis and ev
erybody got hepatitis including 
me. 

Q: Well, that wasn™t very pleasant. 
A: Oh no, they put me in 
the hospital for a few days. 
They used to  treat you with 
I.V.
 
with sugar. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So did you get be
tter in a few days? 
A: I got a little better, yes, but then I had to 
go and find out food outside there, and I 
found a family and the lady used to cook 
spaghetti. And again, 
you couldn™t eat any 
proteins, you know, you had to eat only carboh
ydrate. That™s the way they used to treat 

the Œ 

Q: Really?

A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: I mean, I don™t know, the idea was behind 
that, if you eat proteins, the liver has to 
work  hard er, you see. 

Q: I see. 

A: So they Œ they eat Œ eat only sugar 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So you had a lot 
of spaghetti, huh? 
A: Oh, I had spaghetti for a few months. 

Q: Yes. And you liked it? 

A: Well Œ 
Q: Was that Œ that wasn™t 
the first time you had spaghetti? 
A: No.

48
A: Oh yes. It was not easy because in thos
e days they used to give a big embryology 
course in the junior year. You know now,
 it depends, nowadays they give them 
sometimes in medical school, you know, first 
year. But this teacher was, I think, from 
John Hopkins
. He gave the course in embryology, 
and it™s a tough course because they 
give you boxes of slides, and microscope
s and you just have to Œ to study. 
Q: It™s tedious. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So you went back  to school
, and you didn™t have to go to  
the first year of college, you 
went to the second year in the Œ in these c
ourses, right? Is that correct? The sophomore Œ 
A: No, I took so phomore, then I 
got promoted to junior. And 
in junior Œ from junior you 
can go to medical school Œ 
Q: Oh, you can? 

A: Œ if you make the grades, yeah. 

Q: You don™t have to wait until you™re a senior? 
A: No. But I™ll tell you how they do it. 
Q: Okay , how do th ey do it? 

A: Was accelerated program. 
Q: Uh-huh.

A: So from the junior you go to  first year me
dicine, and at the end of
 first year medicine, 
they give you a college degree. 
Q: Oh, I see, that™s clever. 
A: Colle Œ college degree. 
Q: Right. 

A: Arts Œ college of arts in me
dicine, it™s called, college degree. 
Q: So you got your
 baccalaureate in 
Romania
. And th en you got your college degree in 
Beirut
. Right? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you start medical school, wh at happens? 
A: I continue medical school. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Second year and first semester of 
the third year. But 
that time it™s 1948. 
Q: Oh, so it™s late. 
A: Pardon? 
Q: It™s late. 

A: By that time, things are bad in 
Middle East
.

A: In January 19 Œ sometimes 
in January 1948, the presiden
t of the university called the 
Jewish students in his office. There were se
ven Jewish students, and told them that he 
cannot guarantee their safety in
 the school, and th at we should
 leave. Now, he gave us a 
piece of paper, which is in the file of th
e museum, you know, wher
e he said that the 
[indecipherable]
 government requested the school to
 get rid of the foreign Jewish 
students. Not the Jewish students from Arab
 countries, but s Œ the foreign Jewish 
students. And Œ but he told us about the safe
ty. No w, what happened was that when  this 
happened, most of the Jews th
at we had in  school came from 
Palestine
, and so they went 
back to 
Palestine
. 
Q: Uh-huh. So y Œ wh en  the war ends in 
1945, did you think about going back to 
Romania
, or you didn™t? 
A: I™ll tell you about that. The Œ I 
had, of co urse, problem with money 
[indecipherable]
. 
And they  couldn™t help me from Œ my  family co
uldn™t help me. My father wanted me to 
go back to  
Romania
: he Œ he wrote me a letter. A
nd I didn™t want to go back  in 
Romania
. 
Q: And did your mo ther wr
ite to you also, or not? 

A: My mo th er was saying always, live your
 own life, you know. Do whatever you Œ 
don™t wo rry about us, and so on 
and so  forth, you see? But wh
en this thing 
happened with 
the meeting with the president of
 the American University of 
Beirut
. Now, you have to

know something about this also. This orig
inally was a Presbyterian Missionary school, 
and then later on they made 
it an international college. A
nd the teachers, they were 
Americans that came 
[indecipherable] 
to Presbyterian institutions from 
Colu mbia 
University and from 
John Hopkins
, you see? And they were 
very sympathetic to my 
problem. And th ey wrote letters to 
John Hopkins
, and to people from 
John Ho pkins
, 
and that™s the way I got ad
mitted to University of 
Utah
.

Q: You know, I never asked you the name 
of this little boat that you were on, the 
sailboat, what was the name of it? 
A: 
Euxin
. 
Q: 
Euxin
? 
A: Yeah, is the name of the 
Black Sea
 in the Latin, called 
Eux in
. 
Q: Uh-huh. So that™s 
e-u-x-i-n
? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: I see, okay. Tell me  something, 
di Œ were you, wh
en you were in 
Beirut
, going to  
school, were you also a translator on th e 
radio? Or did you do that separately? 
A: Both. 

Q: Both. 

A: I did translator and speaker. 

Q: And you were going to 
school at the same  time? 
A: Well, this I did it only in the evenings, ab
out three times a week . Let me tell you the 
background of that. In
 Beirut
 there was a commercial att
aché. I think his name was 
Berkovitz
(ph), or something like this. And wh en th
e war started, he started this program 
on 
Radio [indeciphera ble]
 which is the radio in 
Beirut
. And you see, at that time, beru Œ 
Leba no n 
was a French protectorate. 
And when the Œ after the 
[indecipherable]
 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
53
collapsed, these people in Œ in  Fren ch co lonies, the protectorates, bec Œ affidavit to 
de 
Gaulle
, so it became 
F rance Libre
. And Dr. 
Berkovitz
(ph), who was 
[indecipherable]
 
embassy was running a program in 
Ro ma nia
 from the Radio 
[indecipherable]
. And he 
had another gentlemen then that I don™t know 
what happened, he got sick or something, 
and then  he asked me to do th
is three times a week, or someth
ing like this. So I used to go 
there and get the news, transl
ate them, and deliver it.  

Q: Before this, when you we
re going and getting y
our Œ your essentially the Bachelor™s 
degree, when you were going to co llege in 
Beirut
, before you started your medical 
school; the war is still going on, so are you he
aring a lot of news, or there™s not Œ there™s 

not much news? What is it like for you? 
A: Oh Œ 
Q: So, from ™44 to ™45, I thin
k, right? Or from ™43 to ™45. 
A: We Œ we had Œ I mean, in Œ as
 far as telegrams that came in
to the radio station, is that 

what you Œ 
Q: No, I™m talking about before, so y-your 
Œ your Œ you™re doing
 the translatio n from 
1944 to 1945? Is that correct? 
A: Well, I had this job, right. 
Q: Yes. So, you are getting all Œ are you getting 
a lot of news about the war at this time? 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
54
Q: And you Œ do you know
 wh at™s happening in 
Ro ma nia
? 
A: No, I didn™t know exactly what Œ 
Romania
 and I didn™t have Œ there were Œ there 
were once Œ there were not many Romanians Œ the 
Berkovitz
(ph) family was Œ there was 
the doctor, the wife. He was a doctor in busi
ness or some thing, you know, he wasn™t a 
medical doctor. And he Œ and th ere was a son th
ere who was a student in medicine at the 
French school. See, in 
Beirut
 there was a Je suit French uni
versity also, and they  had a 
medical school. So  this guy, his name was 
Za po rta
(ph), he went to that school. So I 
knew him, I Œ I Œ we™re kind of
 friendly. But there were not
 that many Romanians there. 
Q: Did you find out about the Nazis killing 
so many Jews in concentration camps and 
death camps? Did you find that 
out during the war or after? 
A: No. After. 

Q: After. Was that extremely shocking to you? 

A: Yes, to some extent. I Œ I never liked that 
culture. I didn™t take German in high school, 
and I didn™t like Germans, I never buy a Ge
rman car or Œ ye Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I was 
influenced  by th ese things, yeah . 
Q: So what Œ what happ
ened  made a big impact on you in some way. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. When  Œ when you couldn™t stay in 
Beirut
, and these professors wrote, these 
American professors wrote Œ 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
55
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ to 
John s Hopkins
, did 
Jo hns Ho pkins
 have a division in 
Utah
? Is that why you 
went to 
Utah
, or Œ 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: Tell you the relation. You see, the Œ the 
people from Œ one of the people from teaching 
neuro-anatomy in Œ in 
Beirut
, which I think he was from 
John Hopkins
, I did some 
translations for him from Italian to English. 
Some research Œ he wa
s interested in the 
pituitary gland, and I did some resear Œ some
 translations for him,
 and I think maybe Œ 
maybe he was the guy who wrote the letters, 
I don™t know who wrote the letters. But the 
way this happen is that one of the 
John Hopkins
 professor, by th e name of 
Maxwell 
Winthrop
 Œ he was a hematologist, you know, at 
John Hopkins
, became chairman of 
the department of me dicine in 
Uta h
. Now why Œ how that 
happened was that 
Utah
 
before the war had a tw o year 
me dical school. And th en after two years, they had to go 
usually to 
Chicago 
to finish medical school. Now, beca
use of the war, they decided to 
make a four year medical school, and then
 they had to get ch
airmen Œ you know, 
professors. And they got this, the 
Maxwell Winthrop
 from 
John Hopkins
 as a professor 
of medicine. And I think th at he was Jewish
, and I think that they
 approach him, and 
Maxwell Winthrop
 had relation with the Je
wish community
 in Œ in 
Salt Lake City
, and 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
56
the Jewish community there had a fu
nd that was left by somebody from 
Colo rado
, a 
Jewish businessman or something, for schol
arships or something like this, and they 
decided to  give me a scholarship . And this is the way th is 
[indecipherable]
. But that™s 
not only wh at happened. It™s Œ to come as a stude
nt in those days to th
is country, not only 
that you had to have some kind of a schol
arship, but there had to be a guarantee from 
somebody, that if you run out of
 money, they  will contribute 
for your expenses in school 
and so on, so that you don™t re
main penniless. And they  c Œ this was done by a family of 

eye doctors in Œ in 
Ba ltimo r e
. They did the guarantee, bu
t they didn™t give me any 
money or something. The money was from th
at scholarship from th
e Jewish community 
in Œ in 
Salt Lake City
. And I paid it back when I Œ after Œ later on.  
Q: Had you wanted to  come to the 
United States
? 
A: Yes, I wanted to come to finish medica
l school. You see, this
 is something Œ it™s 
something th at Œ once you start so
mething, you have to  finish 
it, and I Œ I Œ I started this 
and I had to  finish medical school, you see, 
so it was very important for me to finish 
medical school. 
Q: But you Œ if they hadn™t sa
id that you Œ they  couldn™t gua
rantee your safety and you 
had to leave 
Beirut
, you would have stayed there. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Probably, and perhap
s made a life there. 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
57
A: I don™t think so. 
Q: You don™t think so. 

A: I was never interested in 
Middle Ea st
 culture. You see, this goes back to the 
background in high school. As I told you, th
ere was a very strong 
French influence, and 
western Œ western interest 
[indecipherable]
. I probably would have taken the medical 
degree there and gone somewhere in 
France
, or somewhere else. 
Q: I see, rig h t. But you Œ 
A: See, na Œ tha Œ that 
Middle East
 culture never attracted me. 
Q: But it was okay to  go to  
Utah
. T h at w a s Œ 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Yeah. Did that Œ 
A: Yeah. You know, it™s very
 funny, but when I left 
Paris
, you see, because I went first 
to 
Paris
, my friends there, Romanian friends 
said, how in the hell are you leaving 
Paris
, 
which is a metropolis of the world,
 that you go out in the western 
United States
 where 
there is nothing there? 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But the situation in 
Paris
 there was not good. After the 
war, in 1948, the situation in 
France 
was bad. First of all, there were not Œ 
not much food, not Œ 
they were depleted. 
And their feeling, a lot of European refugees
, including Ro manian refugees, they  all bring

that is going to be another war betw een the 
United Sta tes
 and 
Russia
, you see? It wasn™t 
a very good situation to stay there and study. 
Q: So you went from 
Beirut
 to 
Paris
 in 1948. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: As a Œ as a way to go to  
Utah
? I mean, th at was Œ 
A: No Œ 

Q: You were Œ 
A: I don™t know, I Œ I Œ I wasn™t sure 
whether I am going to go to school Œ 
Q: I see. 
A: Œ in 
Paris
, or if I ga Œ am going to get admitted to Œ to a school in 
United States
 Œ 
Q: I see, I see Œ 

A: Œ I didn™t know ab out it. 

Q: Œ you didn™t know. So you went to 
Paris
 to wait to see what was going to  happen. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. And how lo ng were you in  
Utah
? 
A: I was in 
Utah
 from 1948 to 19
50, two years. 
Q: Two years. And you Œ and you met 
your wife there, is that correct? 

A: No. 
Q: No. 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici

59
A: That™s another story. Wh ere I was in Œ wh en I was a student in 
Utah
, they have an 
intern there, an American guy from 
Montana
 or from some other western states, and we 
got Œ we got friendly. 
And he went in psychiatry, and came to 
New York
,
 
the 
New York 
hospital, 
Cornell Medical School
, you know, to study psychiatry. So  wh en I was in 
Saint Louis
, an intern, and I came to 
New York
, I came to visit him. And who was there 
as a resident in psychiatry was my wife. 
Q: I see. So that™s when you
 met. And did Œ did 
Œ did you get engage
d and married very 
quick ly, or what? 

A: Oh, no. 

Q: No? Took a long time? 
A: About a year or more, you know. 
Q: And did she come to 
Sa int Louis
? 
A: No. 

Q: No.  
A: You see, I left 
Saint Louis
. 
Q: Oh, I see. And where did you go after 
Sain t Louis
? 
A: I came to 
New York
.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici

A: Now Œ now why did I come to 
New York
? The reason was, while I was in 
Saint

Q: Right. 

A: And I was advised by people in 
Sa int Louis

New York
 they are me Œ th ere 
is more help with 
immigration, you know Œ

A: I was practicing Œ well, I was a resident Œ I 
was a resident in Œ I 
took a year in just 
medicine, then I was a resident in surgery,
 and then I was in pr
actice for 15 years in 
New 
York
. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Right. So  wh en did you go to  
Houston
? After 
New York
? 
A: Then the things change in
 th e profession you see, in 
New York
. And it became the Œ 
the individual practice of medicine like we used to do became group practice. And I 
decided th at I™m going to go to  
Ho uston
 to take a post-graduate training in  heart surgery, 
you see, because thoracic surgery have change
d from the lung, to hear
t surgery. And so I 
took this job in 
Ho u s to n
 for two years, a 
fellowsh ip in the 
Texas Heart Instit ute
. And 
my wife, again, the practice Œ she was in practic
e of psychiatry, became to such an extent 
that she didn™t want to join a group, or 
something like this. And 
she decided to  get the 
training in psychiatric administ
ration. So  she took a two yea
r, went back to school, to a 
Master degree in public health, with emphasi
s on administration. And then sh e took the 
exams to be an administrator.

A: No. 
Q: Œ although th ey 
survived the war. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And Œ and you wrote to 
each other after th e war Œ 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Œ you spoke on th e phone, or what? Did 
you also speak on th
e phone, ev
entually? 
A: No, no, no. 
Q: No. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: But you did see your brother Œ 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: Œ in 
Euro pe
 a number of times. But you never went back to 
Ro ma nia
? 
A: No. 

Q: Do you think that the Œ the 
war affected you in  some way? 
A: Of course I think that this Œ sure. 

Q: How do you think it affected you? I mean, besides the fact that you Œ you ended up 

leaving? 
A: First of all affected us, I think, that we
 went in medicine, you know? I thin k my  wife 
the same way, you see that we went in medici
ne, it affected us in that way. And also, the 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici  
 
August 24, 2010 
 

 
 
63
fact that you had to do a lot of 
[indecipherable]
 changing and sh ifts, gears, so to speak, 
you know? There was a lot of th
at during the war, and you had to
 be very persistent to Œ 
to be ab Œ to Œ to get out of school with
 a degree, you know? And a lot of people advise 
me, why do you have to go up to medical 
school for so many years? Why don™t you 
become a Œ a bacteriologist or a physiologist
, or something and so  on and so forth, you 
see? You had to be very persistent to get 
through medical school, an
d that took a lot of 
energy, no question about. 
Q: Was it awful for you to be so  alone? 
Or did you just make
 friends and Œ and 
accommodate them th at way? 
A: I don™t know, maybe Œ I had friends, and 
I had a very  good re
lation Œ see, I been 
married for 52 years, and I 
had a very good relation w
ith my  wife. And being both 
docto rs 
[indecipherable]
 understand the profession and so
 on. And that, they are very 
helpfu l, of course. 

Q: But before that, it h ad to be very difficu
lt for you, to leave as  such a young person. 
A: Well, again Œ again, it was just very pers
istent to get through medicine and specialties 
and 
[indecipherable]
 examination, and so on. There 
are a lot of exams in medicine, 
continuously  you know, and traveling 
to Œ to get the kn
owhow, you know. 
Q: Yes. You Œ but you s Œ you did say someth
ing, that you though
t the war influenced 
you even  to become a docto r. 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici

64
A: Yes. 
Q: And is that because you™
ve Œ well, why Œ why Œ why di
 Œ why would you say that? 
Cause you seem to have wanted  to
 beco me a doctor fo r a long time. 
A: I don™t know. I think that maybe the 
idea was that seeing Œ 
you know, there was 
another thing also that was when I was 
the Œ as I say, when I went the Œ to 
Paris
, you 
know, waiting to come to th
is country, there were a lot of refugee camps in 
Euro pe
, you 
know. And a friend of mine, a den
tist who was Œ his family was in 
Palestine
 was going 
around these camps try ing to convince Jewi
sh people in the 
camps to come to 
Marseilles
, 
so that they can 
emigrate to Œ to 
Israel
, because by that time, the state was there. 
Q: Yes. 
A: And there Œ I don™t know, there are a lot 
of bad situations around and I don™t know, 
maybe I had the feeling that being a doctor you 
can help some people, or you can help to  
change some of the situation. 

Q: Mm-hm. Did you practice Œ when you pr
acticed medicine, did you meet people who 
called themselves survivors, 
who went thro ugh th e war? 
A: No. 

Q: You didn™t. 
A: You see, in Œ no, mo st of those people 
concentrated around th
e Jewish hospital in 
New 
York
, you know, like 
Mount Sinai
, 
Beth Israel 
Œ 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici

65
Q: Right. 
A: Œ and Œ and later on 
I had the relation with 
Beth Israel
, but by the time I came to 
Beth 
Israel
, it w as late in th Œ it was a kind of a re
ligious situation, it wasn™t the Œ th-the 
situation of a war, you see? 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But the one thing wh ich Œ 
which remains, and this has 
been said before by other 
people, now that this Nazi 
Germany
 produced a tremendous amou
nt of shifting of people 
and population all around 
Euro pe
, a tremendous amount 
of damage, you know. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: We do have to change the tapes.

Beginn ing Tape Five 
Q: 
Harry
, did Œ did you th ink 
of working in the 
DP
 camps at all when you Œ wh en you 
went Œ 
A: No. 
Q: You didn™t, when  you came to 
Euro pe Œ 

A: No. 

Q: Œ wh en you went to 
Paris
, you didn™t? 
A: No. This friend of mine, the dentist, he we
nt to some of those camp s, and Œ trying to  
bring people to Œ 

Q: To 
Israel
, yes. 
A: Œ go to 
Israel
, right. Yeah, but I didn™t Œ 
Q: But s Œ so  you didn™t even think of whet
her you could work , even with the minimal 

amount of knowledge that you had as 
a two years doctors Œ medical student? 
A: No. 
Q: You didn™t.  
A: You see, this is th Œ is another thing th
at, probably now that y
ou ask those question, I 
think that one of the reason I was persistent 
to get a medical degree in th Œ work  as a 
doctor, was to give some stab
ility, internal stability that yo
u were somebody that has a 
purpose, and so on, instead of floating. No
w, there were a lot of young men floating 

 
Interview with Harry Iticovici

67
around 
Paris
 and floating around 
Israel
 in those days, you see?
 And being a doctor and 
having a definite profession, 
it gives you ce Œ a certain amount 
of inner stability, I think. 
Q: And this was clearly a big co ncern for you
, that you have something that was yours. 
A: And something that this was, and some
thing that you can co
ncen trate on, and get 
some result s. 
Q: Right, right. So  was Œ was the profession 
of being a docto r very
 satisfying for you? 
A: Yes. 
Q: It was. 
A: Yeah. I Œ I Œ in spite of 
all this talk you know, with 
Obama
care, you know, all this 
talk about medicine and so  on, I said well, I me
an, if I h ad to do it again, I™ll do it again. 
Q: When  Œ when  did you retire from medicine? 

A: After the 
Katrina
. Well, let me Œ you see, after the 
Katrina
, they closed the Œ I used 
to work in 
a clinic in 
Charity
 
Ho spita l
 for many years, you know. 
I worked in the clinic 
and you see, I had the two ap pointments. I ha
d Œ I was clinical associate professor in 
surgery at 
Tulane Medical School
. I™m still there, I™m emeritu
s now. And I had, at the 
same time, a position in the 
cli Œ different clin ics in 
Charity
 
Hosp ital
, because that™s 
where I go Œ I was getting paid 
to, you see? But the work in 
Charity
 
Hospital
, you have 
to belong to the medical school, y
ou know, it™s one of those things.

Q: I see, rig h t. So you went to 
New Orleans
 after you™d been in 
New York

Houston

Ch arity Hosp ital 
for 28 years.  
Q: Wow. 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 I was teaching surgery for a time Œ 
for a time. Then 
I worked in a 
walk-in clinic, then I worked 
in an anesthesia clinic. Last
 thing in the 2005, I was in 
anesthesia clinic. 

Q: So you were s
till w o rking in 2005? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: That™s a very long 
[indecipherable]
 
A: And then they wrote a letter
 saying that the hospital is going to close, and if Œ it Œ my 
situation, after all these years, 
that I can retire, so 
I retire. Most of us 
who worked in that 
situation retired. 
Q: Did th at make you feel terrible that you 
didn™t Œ you didn™t want
 to retire, or did Œ

died. 
Q: That mu st have been  difficult. 

A: That was one hit. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And then the second hit was 
Ka trin a
, you see? And I had the impression in my  age 
that I have to Œ to 
wait for a long time in 
New Orleans
 to change the situation. So then I 
decided I™m just going to come here, you see. 

Q: To 
Wash ington
