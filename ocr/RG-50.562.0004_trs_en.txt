A: It™s very hard for me to actually translat
e it. He had a transportation business, and in 
those days I guess people were importing ma
ny goods, and the goods were going to 
different destinations. So he was trans
porting the good from different countries, 
sometimes even from 
China
, and from western countries, to different destinations. And 
he was in charge of warehousing them, so 
he had a warehouse, and he was char -- in 
charge of transport, and he had the -- actua
lly, he didn™t own them, but he -- he -- 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 no, he -- he rented horses and ca
rriages and so on. We didn™t have 
trucks, yet, in those days. 
Q: You didn™t have trucks. 
A: I mean, well there must have been tr
ucks, but my  father didn™t use trucks. 
Q: So he owned this business? 

A: He owned his business. 
Q: Right. 
A: Yes, it was his business, and 
it was located initially in -- on the 
Place Halicki
, I s -- 
think the number five, yes. And it was a 
wonderful location beca
use every time there 
were parades, you co uld go on balcony and right
 in front of you, you could see all the -- 
the best -- you had the best view of parade
s coming through, militar
y parades, you know, 
on holidays, such May third. In 
Poland
 it™s a very great holid ay. 
Q: And what is that -- 
A: It™s on -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004

Q: -- what is that holiday, May third, in 
Poland? 
A: I think May third is independence. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yeah, right. A -- a -- Constitution day. I don™
t even know if I recall correctly. I hope I 
-- I recall correctly, right. 

Q: How do you remember your father when 
you were a kid? What
 kind of a person was 
he, do you reme mb er? 

A: Well, my father, I -- I remember him first 
always as a very impeccably dressed. He -- 
his shirts were s --  spic -and-span, his tie
s was tied properly. He had wonderful suits, 
always well pressed. And he -- oo -- in the 
fashion of the day, he wore a ca -- cane. 
Q: Really? 

A: That™s what the gentlemen wore. 

Q: A hat, too? 
A: And a hat, too, of course. 
Q: Yes. 

A: I mean, of course a hat. 
But I don™t know, I re -- re -- 
when I look at him I see him 
without a hat, but definitely a hat. If you we
nt out, he had to have a hat, right, yeah. 

Q: Did you eat lunch 
and dinner togeth er? 

A: Yes, we did. It was splendid. It was a 
wonderful thing to reme
mb er. My father would 
come for lunch, at about 1:30, and so woul
d I from school. And the table was set in the 
dining ro om, and usually very nicely set. It 
was linen, and linen  napkins, and a -- and s -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
7
and sterling silver, because my mother lo
ved to use it every day, and beautiful 
Czechoslovakian
 chin a. And -- and we had a maid, so my  mo th -- the maid would bring 
[indecipherable]
 and my  mo ther would -- there was a tureen, usually. The big meal was 
at noon -- not at noon, at 1:30 actually. So we
 had several -- several dishes. And so the 
first usually was appetizers, and I didn™t eat 
those. And th en we had soup, and th e maid 
would bring in the tureen, and my  mo ther w
ould pour -- it was very s -- pouring th e soup, 
it was very civilized, yeah. And -- but one th
ing happened during 
the meal, my father 
used to read. So we didn™t talk, we just read
. So he could read his paper, and I could read 
my book. 
Q: So ev erybody around th e table would read? 
A: Just most of a -- mo re or less, right. Beca
use when I was little my 
mother used to read 
to me to encourage me to eat, right? 

Q: Encourage you to eat? 
A: Eat, right. And -- I didn™t want to eat, 
so  my  mo th er wou l d  r
ead to me, and then I 
would eat, you see? I™m sorry, I wa
s a spoiled brat, I guess.  
Q: You were spoiled? 

A: Yes, yes. I was an only child and not only
 an only child
 in my family, but in all 
extended family, there 
were no other sma ll chi ldren, so I was very doted upon, if I may 
say so, right. 

Q: By ev erybody. 
A: Right.

Q: Now, I would gather that
 your mo ther did not wo rk ? 
A: No, no, of course not. In th
ose days ladies did not work . 
Q: Right. 
A: Right. 

Q: And what was she like?  

A: Well, my mother is very sweet, if I ca
n say. Sh e was a very kind person. She -- she 
always told me to think of other people befo
re I think of myself. Well -- and she was very 
kind, and she wouldn™t kill a fl
y. Really, literally, she wouldn™
t kill a fly. She would open 
a window and let the fly go free. 
Q: You were very close to her, weren™t you? 
A: Well, I was her confidant, and her only 
child, and I was the apple of her ey e. And I 
never e -- imagined I could live without her 
[indecipherable]
 right. Yeah. Such is fate.  
Q: Did you -- did you spend a lot of time with
 your mother and your 
father, or more time 
with your mo ther as you rememb er? 

A: More -- more time with my
 mother, because my father 
had -- had to go to work . 
Actually, after lunch he would 
take a siesta. E v erybody took 
a siesta, little nap. And that 
was very nice me mo ry also. He would lie do
wn on th e couch with  his paper, which was 
called 
ﬁMomentﬂ
 in  English and ﬁ
Chwilaﬂ 
in  Po lish. And it was very good Po lish paper. 
Polish Jewish paper, was very good paper. And 
I cou -- had to lie down too, my mo ther 
want me -- wanted me to take a nap, but 
I wouldn™t, so I would read, and my mother 
would prepare -- either she would prepare or 
we would go shopping to buy sweets. And I 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
9
could lie down with my  book a
nd my  sweets, my  chocolate, or my  -- or the dates, or 
whatever. Whatever there was on
 the menu, and that was very nice, very pleasant kind of 
memory, right. 
Q: Did you spend so me time with your fath
er alone? Did he -- did he talk with -- 
A: Initially, as a child, I did. 
My father was not necessar -- he was -- he was kind of 
critical, you know. He -- I -- a -- a -- I -- when 
I finally learned how to read I read so 
much and he felt that I di
dn™t read the right stuff. 
Q: Oh. 
A: Well, y -- I -- I read right stuff, and I re
ad the wrong stuff, I guess. You know, like all 
the young people do, right? Well an
yway, I read a lot, too much. 
Q: What™s the wrong stuff? 

A: The wrong stuff would be some kind 
of romances, or whatever, you know. 
Q: Uh-huh. You weren™t -- it
 wasn™t serious enough. 
A: Yeah, but I -- you know, I a -- I 
wrote -- I read serious too. I read 
Pascal 
at age 13, 
showed I was serious. And zit -- oh, as a child,
 I inherited a library. I really -- there was a 
library for me from my 
uncle, my mother™s brother. And 
he kept the books for me, so 
when  I was born I inherited hundred children™s books. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. So I had those childre
n™s books and the books were 
onert
 because they were 
being housed in a china cabinet. There was a 
china cabinet and that
 was meant for my 
books. So I had books, yeah 
[indecipherable]
 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
10
Q: That™s very special. 
A: It was -- it was very special, rig h t. So 
anyway -- so -- so I read
 a lot, I guess. And I 
was an only child, I had no
body to  play with, so what
 else was ther e to do? 
Q: When  you went to school, didn
™t you have playmates at school? 
A: Well, even before I went to school, my 
mother decided that I couldn™t be brought up 
without children™s influence, so  she hired, actually, a little gi
rl -- a little Jewish girl who 
would co me to me to do -- who would come to 
visit us, and I would play with  her and we 
would -- sometimes she would br
ing her sister. And we would 
play cards, oh we played 
cards forever and ever. And my mi -- my -- b u t 
I knew that she paid for it so I kind of felt 
I -- you know, I had mi-mixed feelings about 
this. But later on she -- we became friends 
and we stayed friends until I went to high sc
hool. Well no, until I went to school, because 
that was be-before I -- 

Q: Before you went to school. 
A: Right. 
Q: What did that feel like, that -- I mean that
 your mo ther would pay somebody to do that 
-- 
A: Well, it felt bizarre, I woul
d say. It still feels bizarre. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But on th e other hand, when  I look at it, 
I see my  mo t h er was a 
very modern thinking 
woman. She decided a child needs to have a pl
aymate, and it wasn™t healthy for me to be 
surrounded forever with a bunch of adults.  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
11
Q: Right.  
A: And that™s why she -- she wanted me to have comp an ionship. 
Q: So there were no children 
even in the 
neighborhood? 
A: There were children in the 
neighborhood, but I was not allowed to  play in  the street. I 
could not play in the street, and I 
could not play in the courtyard. 
Q: Only  in the house? 

A: Only in the house,
 because there could have been so
me negative influences, whatever 
they were, because there were 
all kinds of street children, 
you know. I never played out -- 
outside. 

Q: So you didn™t play sports? 
A: No, my mother was so happy
. I wasn™t -- I wasn™t very g
ood in s -- well, not that I 
wasn™t for -- my own mother discourage it, ac
tually. She was -- she was -- and we had no 
river, and -- because our river was bur
ied underground. The 
river was called 
Peltew
. And 
it was buried underground, my  mo ther wasn™t 
very happy about that. So I didn™t swim, 
right. And th e next thing is that I never went 
how to ride a bicycle, 
so I didn™t know how 
to ride it. I think my mother wa
s very concerned about my safety. 
Q: I guess. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. 

A: Well, yeah.  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
12
Q: Did you -- when you went 
to school, did -- was there,
 wa -- as th ey do in the 
United 
States
 have gym classes, or a play time so you play? 
A: Oh yeah, yes, oh definitely, oh yeah. We
 had recreation times. That was all g irl™s 
school, by th e way. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because those times the schools were segregat
ed. As a matter of fact there were -- was 
on one side was a girl™s school, on the other 
side was a boy™s school, but we never met 
during recreation. The recreat
ion time was at different times. And yeah, we had gym 
classes, and we had th e religion classes. Catho
lic girls went to -- went to be taught by a 
priest, and we had th e religious teacher, we 
had the man who taught 
us religion, Hebrew. 
I was very bad student, I have 
to confess, yeah. Excuse me. 
Q: Was this a public school? 

A: That was a public school -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- absolutely, yeah. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So did you feel comfortabl
e going to  a school wi -- bei
ng with all these kids, when  
you had been with so few children? 

A: Oh yeah, I didn™t feel uncomfortable. Once
 I learned how to read I became the best 
student, and I was very well liked. But don™
t -- you mustn™t forget, it was a Catholic 
school -- i-it wasn™t Catholic, actually, it wa
s a public school, but 
since the country was 
Catholic, then there were, of course, images 
o f -- religious images on the wall. And -- and 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
13
there was -- you felt you were not pop -- y
ou were a minority right from the beginning. 
There was -- yeah. I remember, I had one -- we
ll, there was the -- the issue came up -- I 
don™t know if you are interested in that 
at all, but the issue came up of killing
 Christ
, and 
the Jews killed 
Christ
. And I was in second grade, and 
I had the temerity to get up and 
say, ﬁBut I thought the Romans killed 
Christ.ﬂ
 And th e teacher said 
absolutely not. And I 
went back to my father, and I 
told him she said that, and he
 scolded me too. She scolded 
me, he scolded me. You know, because I s
houldn™t have spoken up, right? But on th e 
same -- by the same token, I was very well 
treated by the teachers. I reme mb er I had a 
favorite teacher and she -- I think I must have
 been one of her favorite students, too. 
When -- and a time came when we
 had to join  the Girl Scouts. And since it was again, a 

religious group, we Jewish gir -- children coul
d not participate in th
at. So she -- she kind 
of felt bad about me, and once
 she said, ﬁWouldn™t you -- wouldn™t you rather be 
Catholic?ﬂ That was a heavy question, you know
, and I didn™t want to offend her because 
I really liked and respected her. And it tookme a long time to answer, and I rememb er 

that, I rememb er and I -- the row I stood in , and 
I looked at the -- I lo
oked  like this at the 
window in those ton -- to the left of me, a
nd I stood th ere for quite awhile, and I said -- I 
said, ﬁI want to be what God made me.ﬂ An
d she accepted that, and she didn™t question 
me after that at all, ever. And it was -- yeah
. I -- i -- i -- yeah, I ha -- I -- I told her the 
truth, I guess. I t -- 

Q: Right. Now let me ask you something. In  the second grade you 
knew enough about the 
Christian religion to know that the Romans had killed 
Jesus
? Or di -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
14
A: Well, I didn™t know -- Christian religions
 does not accept the fact that the Roman -- 
that they just -- at that time, don™t fo
rget. Those times was different world -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and in 
Poland
, in ec -- so in those times that wa
s -- that was the belief. And I knew 
about it because I -- I was c
oncerned about it before. I de
veloped a frie
ndship with a 
Catholic girl. That girl was 
Jadzia
. And we discussed in very  often the catechism
, 
because she studied the 
catechis
. And she told me that first, 
so I went to my father, and I 
asked him. And -- and my  father said this
 -- you know, I -- as far I know, i -- Romans 
crucified 
Christ
. 
Q: Mm-hm. I see. So did you -- 

A: So -- 

Q: -- did you go back a
nd tell your little friend? 
A: I -- I might have, but I don™t recall that.  
Q: Oh. 
A: I -- w-we were very open 
with one another. For one thing she co uld never read  the 
books that were indexed, because many books like 
Dumas
, 
Alexander Dumas
, those 
were indexed books. And I read them freely ,
 I mean later on, in -- in -- in -- in -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- grammar school I read them. So, you know, there were ﬁ
Three Musketeers
,ﬂ and 
there was everything that came after, and ﬁ
La Reine Margot,ﬂ 
an d all -- and the story of 
-- of Saint -- of the massacre of 
S a int Bartholomew
, and all that. I -- you know? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
15
Q: Right. 
A: It™s i -- in -- in -- those were fiction books, but there was a lot of history in th em. 
Q: Right. 
A: So we discussed them. A
nd there were other books by 
Sa ba tini
 that dealt with popes. 
There was 
Alexander Borga
 and so on and so forth. So
 we -- we discussed that. We 
were good friends, but we were still good friends. 
Q: Right. 
A: We never fought over religion or anything
. We just accepted one another as we were. 
Q: So did you feel anti-Semitism,
 or just feel as a minority? 
A: Well, i-it was -- the air was imb u ed with
 anti-Semitism, because we were a minority, 
and the other minority was the Ukrainians, and 
they were not liked either, but the times 
have been ch anging. In 19 -- there was the 
Treaty of Versailles
, and according to the 
Treaty of Versailles, 
all the min o rities have to be -- yo
u had to have rights. I don™t know 
if equal rights, but rights, pr-privileges. 
And that was not alwa
ys maintained. And it 
actually was completely curta
iled in 1934, or 1
935. Anyway, it change
d completely with 
the death of 
Marshal Pilsudski
, who -- who was kind of protecting the -- the -- I mean, 
he was kind of protecting Jewish interests in
 -- not Jewish interests, but the Jews in 
general, I think. It -- it -- actually, he wanted
 to live more up to this treaty, and -- that was 
instituted by 
Wilson
, if I recall my history correctly. 
So -- so the minori -- the minor -- ra 
-- the -- a-a-as the time went on, the fascistic
 
propaganda became overwhelming, and 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
16
there were instituted -- there were pogroms, 
and there were -- what should I say? Sabo -- 
not sabotages, but boycotts of Jewish -- of 
Jewish businesses and so on and so forth. 
Q: You™re talking now about be
fore 1939, before the war -- 
A: Oh, that™s before ™39. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 contex t. 
A: -- at beginning 1935.  
Q: Right, right. 
A: ™34 - ™35, right, right. 

Q: Now did th -- did the depression 
affect your father™s business? 
A: Goodness, yeah. 
Q: It did? 

A: Oh terribly. My father was in horrendou
s financial pro -- I mean, he had a horrendous 
financial problems. Numb er one, if he had so
me money in dollars, he lost half of it, 
because the dollar, until the fall of 
Wall Street, 
the dollar was 10 
zlotys. 
And when the 
crash happened, he land -- lost the hat. The valu
e of dollar wer -- went down to five. So if 
he had any holdings in dollars, that was theend. And he -- he had th e ongoing financial 
problems, which actually contri
buted to the fact that by the time th e Nazi™s came, we 
were completely depleted financially already.
 So depleted -- even 
th e R u ssian s w h en  th ey  
came, yeah. And during the Ru ssians, because when the Russi
ans came, it was -- only my 
father worked at that time. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
17
Q: Right. So  how did th at affect you in  the h
ousehold, as you were 
four years old at the 
time of the depression, but then  though the next years -- 
A: Well, it is -- is slowly -- well, it did -- 
it didn™t happen  right aw
ay, I think, you know, 
depression didn™t happen right away, took a little while. 
Q: Right, yeah. 

A: So by the time 19 -- I-I think it did -- by 
us it was also gradual. So -- but we still 
maintain a certain level of livi
ng, i-in spite of it. So my father w-was getting further in 
debt. 

Q: I see. 
A: We still went on vacation every year to -- 
to a spa, you know? That was the fashion, 
that™s what you did, no matter 
what, right? And so we did. 
Q: And it™s expensive. 

A: And it was expensive, and it was -- yeah, but we 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: You were -- w-where did you go? 

A: So we -- we had sever -- I -- I remember, 
in the beginning we went very close by, and 
this is because they 
had this special kind of bath ther
e, and th e -- the mud bath, for my  
father. He had arthritis, so he felt the -- it was called 
Lubien Wielki
, and it was a very 
interesting spa. I was four years old when 
I remember th at. And -- and they had a little 
park, a la parks in 
Vienna
, and -- only miniscule, miniscule,
 very small, mini-park. And 
then they  would import operetta singers, and -- 
and they -- they -- an
d they would -- they 
had special pavilions, and they woul
d sing all their famous operettas by 
Strauss
, or by 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
18
Laihag, 
or by co  -- K
ohlman
. Oh  I -- I don™t recall exactly the name, yeah. No , not 
Kohlman
. There™s another name starting with a 
K
. I don™t -- I don™t recall. Anyway , so 
there -- I had very fond memories in that place, right. 
Q: That was nice for kids, were there other kids there? Was -- 

A: There probably were, but I wa
s always with my parents. 
Q: Right. 
A: They ke -- I remember one time I went to the park in th
e morning with the maid, and -
- and my  mo ther didn™t know what I -- wher
e I was, so when I came back, I got my 
beating, my one and only beating. My mo
ther slapped me. Yeah, can you imagine? For 
being independent. 
Q: And how -- you were 
four years old there? 

A: Four years old. I rememb er that
. That™s -- that was the only time. 
Q: Right. 
A: Never -- never after. 
Q: And did the maid stay with
 you, independent of this lo
ss of money, or did -- at one 
point did she go? 
A: Well, I -- th -- there was -- th-t
he maid stayed until s -- maybe ™38. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Right. 

Q: Right. 
A: Right, right. Yeah, in spite of the loss of money, right.

Q: Were you a religious family? 
A: No, not at all. 
Q: Not at all. 
A: We were very assimilated. But there we 
-- I knew, apparently, who I was. But up to 
six years I had a Christmas tree.  

Q: Really? 
A: Right. 
Q: And then  what happ
ened at six years? 
A: They decide I was too old fo
r a Christmas tree, apparently. 
Q: You were too old? 

A: Right. 

Q: So that was -- that was -- 

A: So that was the end of it, no more Christmas tree. 
Q: -- so then there was nothing, there was no religious celebration? 
A: Oh no, no, there was, too. Now -- I ca
n™t say. We cele -- celebrated Passover. I -- 
when I said we were non-religious, I meant we were non-Orthodox. 
Q: Okay . 
A: All right. So not -- not religious. We respec
ted all the holid ays. In other wo rds we had 
the -- I never -- I tried to eat only matz
oh on Passover -- during 
Passover, right? My 
mother religiously lit candl
es every Friday night. 
Q: Really? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
20
A: That was a present she got from her mother-in-law. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: With the promise that she would light th
e candles, and she did. Every Friday until the 
last Friday before the ro
und up of A
ugust 1942. 
Q: Still? 
A: Oh, all the way through -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- until the August 1942. 

Q: Yeah? 
A: Yeah. Cause my mother always kept her pr
omises. She was -- I told you, she was very 
kind person, and she was very honorable. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right. 
Q: Did you go to synagogue also? 
A: You know, women didn™t go to synago
g u e mu ch . My  mo th er
 took me to the 
synagogue because I re
member my father couldn™t fast all day on 
Yom Kippur
, so she -- 
my  mo ther would take me to the synagogue 
to make the offering of candles, because she 
couldn™t fast. And -- yeah, it -- i-it™s ironic,
 because we fasted plenty afterwards. 

Q: Years. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
21
A: Right. And th en I rememb er going one to 
th e famous synagogue of that was cours -- 
called the 
Rose 
synagogue, but just one time. And 
-- and then, of course, the -- it was 
completely destroyed by the Germans.  
Q: When  you say you knew w
ho you were, you knew that
 you had been born Jewish? 
A: Yeah, I knew who I was because rememb er
 -- ah, of course you don™t remember, 
sorry. When I was -- when we had 
to -- when I went to school, 
on the first day, they made 
us line up, th e Jewish girls in one 
-- in one -- what would you call it? 
Q: A row? 

A: One ro w, and in one -- and the Catholics gi
rls in the -- in the other. So I knew th -- 
apparently I wasn™t hundred percent sure then, 
it was at the age of seven, I wa -- I wasn™t 
hundred percent sure then, but 
I -- I joined the right row. So  my -- I -- I had my identity, I 
guess.  

Q: Did you feel religious
? Did you feel like -- 
A: I didn™t feel religious, but I 
had the -- I had the need  for God. 
Q: Even at a young age? 

A: Very young age. Ve
ry young age, yes.  
Q: And do you know what that
 need was about? Did you pr
ay , did you talk to God? 
A: Yes, I guess I did, and -- because I reme mb er
 I was even -- I was ve
ry scared to go to 
the bedroom. I shared the bedroom with my  pare
nts at that time. And of course it was so 
dark. When they put me to sl
eep it was dark and th ere was no light. So I was practicing, 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
22
and I said -- and I couldn™t go in th e room all 
by myself, it was so dark. So I said, I -- I do 
it for God. And that™s how 
I went to the dark room. 
Q: And so you felt safer. 
A: Not that I felt safer, no, 
no, not that -- I didn™t fa -- I 
go in there for to -- a couple 
seconds. And -- but I did it -- to make my self do it, I had to make a sacrifice to God. 

Q: I see. I see. 
A: I-I hope I am not telling too much. 
Q: No, it™s very interesting to he
ar how you put this all together. 
A: Well, as a child, the -- I™m not responsible. 
Q: Yeah, right. Did you enjoy the holid ays? 
A: I -- I did, more or less. Yes, with a little
 -- they not special,
 e -- I don™t know, we 
didn™t have comp any or anything, so I -- I don
™t recall, as a company s -- thing. I -- I -- I 
have no reco llection. 
Q: Right. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Now, I know you were very interested 
in books, and you were a very good student. 
Were there other -- 

A: I was only very good student 
in hi -- in grammar school, I --  
Q: After that sh -- 

A: Once I got into high school I had -- I had 
my  demons. And one of them was my  math 
teacher. It so happened she was my mother™s
 math teacher previously, so -- and my 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
23
mo ther said, ﬁOh, I just hoping you don™t get 
her.ﬂ And I did. So  I was scared of her out -
- out of my wits.  
Q: Really? 
A: Right, right. 

Q: And math was difficult? 

A: And one -- ma th became difficult, yes. 
Q: I see. 
A: Right. But I liked the other subjects.
 I was good in other subjects, yeah. 
Q: Like what? 
A: Oh, like Latin. 
Q: Really? 

A: In French  I was pretty bad in  the beginning, but then  my  aunt, who sp oke French, 

tutored me, so I became good in  French, and in English -- in -- not in English, but in 
Polish I was pretty good. Wh at else did we
 have? In history I was really good. I -- 
Q: Really? 
A: Oh yeah. I tutore
d the other students. 
Q: Did you? 

A: Yeah, right. We had a very bad teacher 
for that, too, but she was not bad for me 
because I knew my 
history inside out. 
Q: Right. Before -- we have to stop the tape, 
but before we stop the tape, what™s your first 
name of your father and the first name of your mo ther? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
24
A: My mother™s name was 
Maria. 
Q: 
Maria
? 
A: Right. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And my father™s name was 
Moritz
. In Polish would be 
Maurycy
, and in Yiddish it 
was 
Moshe.
 And I mentioned that my mother™s 
name in Yiddish mu st have been 
Miriam
. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right. 
Q: Okay, we™re going to ha
ve to change the tape. 
A: Okay, all right. I -- 
End of Tape One  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
25
Beginning Tape Two 
Q: Okay . I wanted to  ask you a couple of mo
re questions before we get to the war, and 
the uncomfortable parts. 
A: Okay . 

Q: Let™s talk a little bit more abou
t these vacations that you took. 
A: Well, one time my father won a stay
 in a fancy spa in a place called 
Iwonicze, 
and -- 
for a whole month. So  we all went there, my
 mo ther and I, and prob
ably cost my father 
much more than he an
ticipated, e-even with his winnings.
 And over there, I -- w e made 
an acquaintance of a very nice family. Most 
of the people in this particular spa were 
Jewish, but this fami ly was not. And it consis
ted of, I think, mo th er, and -- and a son. 

And the so -- i-if I was 11, he was probably
 13. He -- and we usually walked together, 
and my  -- the parents walked in  the back, and 
we walked in the front, and we talked, and 
everything was fine. And one da
y -- and it was Sunday , I went out o-on th e porch, and th-
that young boy was there, and I had my  ne
w dress on. So  he asked me, ﬁAre you ready 
for church?ﬂ And I said, ﬁNo, I™m Jewish.ﬂ 
And th at was the end of our acquaintance. 
Q: Really? 
A: Right. That was the end of our acquaintance. 
Q: Is that shocking to you? 

A: No, not at all. It was not
 shocking me because it was to be anticipated. Shortly before 
that, maybe day before, I -- I fe
lt it coming, because he referred to our -- our place with a 
play on words, and I don™t know if
 I can translate it. This was like a 
pension
, 
pensio nne 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
26
in French, 
pensionne
, or a hotel. In Polish it™s called 
pensjonat
. So he made a -- a pretty 
good, witty play on words by saying it was 
peysonat.
 A
 payess 
means the curls that the 
Orthodox Jews wear. And when -- I didn™t sa
y anything when he said that, I didn™t -- I 
didn™t comment on it at all, but maybe two da
ys after this inc -- incident happened, and 
that was -- and that™s why 
I kind of anticipated it. 
Q: Right. And what was the play
 on words? In -- in Polish -- 
payasot
?  
A: You see -- you see, what he meant by -- 
pensjonat 
is the word that describes the place 
where we were staying. And 
peysonat
 is a word  that has no sense except of the sense of 
the -- of the 
payess.
 
Q: Right. 
A: Th-the place where the Jews stay. 

Q: Jews, right. 

A: But it was derogatory of course -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- in -- in its meaning. Bu
t this was the -- this was the 
climate of the times. A nd that 
was 1935, probably. Y
eah, I had to be maybe -- I was -- I was -- no, maybe 1936. I had -- 
Q: So its a little later. 

A: A little later, right. 

Q: Now, one place where you went, you learned to
 love plants a lot. What was -- was that 

this first place that you described? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
27
A: Yeah, that was the first place w h ere I desc
ribe that, because the -- the owner of the hut 
that my mother rented -- I 
say hut because it was a peasant™s hut, and -- which was very 
comfortable, by the way. We had a wonderfu l 
garden , and -- and th-the alley leading to 
the garden  was planted with dahlias, but the hu
ge dahlias, the tall d a
hlias, so they were, 
of course, all taller than I am, and they were
 full of flowers, and the flowers were every 
color of -- you can imagine. Black, and mi
xed colors, and red and wh ite. One flower 
could have been red and wh ite, the other coul
d have been  pink and yellow and so on and 
so forth. Maybe not pink and ye
llow, but pink and wh ite, a-and 
so on and so forth. They 
were just magnificent. So I was -- 
Q: And the name of this spa? Where was this? 
A: In the -- it was called 
Lubien Wielki
, and it had a separate park wh ere the baths were, 
and where you get your -- wh
ere you went to take your 
waters. And also where you 
attended the concerts in the evenings
. Was very, very civilized, right.  
Q: Now usually wh en you went on vacation, 
it wasn™t for a month, the way you were at 
the spas -- 

A: Oh yes -- 
Q: It was? 
A: -- it was for two months, usually. 

Q: Two months? 

A: Yes. Initially you went for 
vacation and -- for two months.  
Q: Really? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
28
A: Right. You -- you rented a place, and then
 you stayed there, and you could a - eat in 
different -- not restaurants, but establishmen
ts. Yeah, usually it was two months. We even 
went in 1938, but we went ju
st for one month, because that was -- the writing was on the 
wall already, and -- right. I-It -- yeah. 
Q: And did your father stay with you fo r th
e two weeks, or he went back and forth? 
A: No, no, my father never st
ayed with us. He always came maybe for a week or two, 
that was the most. We stayed all -- all su
mmer, right. That was a big production, right. 
Every year we went by train, a -- a -- a carr
iage would come to the house, ho -- horse and 
carriage, take all our valises. And sometimes
 beddings, too, I -- 
I -- depended, I don™t 
know. I -- in the beginning, in the beginning.
 Later on, it was less a nd less, yes. That was 
the lifestyle, even for the poor
 pe -- we weren™t poor, but 
-- because we lived above our 
means, but that™s -- that was the lifestyle. 

Q: Was that true for the rest of your family? Extended family? 
A: That was certainly true for my immediate fami -- yeah, it was certainly true for my 
grandmother™s family, yes. My grandmother™s family in 
Lwów
. Certainly not for my 
grandmother in 
Prze mysl
, because my  grandmother in 
Przemysl
 lived in dire penury, 
because she lost her husband ve
ry young, and I think her daughter, who got married, also 
lost her husband very  young. So
 they -- she was left with 
the progeny of I don™t know 
how many daughters, and the gr
anddaughters. And -- and the 
-- they -- they eked out a 
very precarious living. I think 
they had a bakery and it was 
very hard to maintain. And 
my  father send them money, and so did the family out of 
America
, because she -- my 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
29
grandmother in 
Prze mysl
 had three children in 
America
. She had three -- two daughters, 
and one son in 
New Yo rk
, and two daughters -- no, three daughters in 
Chicag o
.  
Q: Hm. 
A: And my father pay -- send my  grandmother 25
 zlotys
 every mo nth, as long as he -- he 
could. 

Q: So this was your father™s mother in 
Prze mysl
? 
A: That was my father™s mother. 

Q: Right. 

A: She came only twice to visit us. I remember
 I think twice, or ma ybe just once. One 
time I remember she came with he
r grandchildren, who were s
lightly older than I am, and 
they were very beautiful. I us
ed to look at them, and I ad
mired them. And they had such  
beautiful co mp lexions, and -- and they -- they
 looked completely different from me. They 
had dark hair, dark straight 
hair, cut mo re or less like I have it now. And they  had those 
pretty faces, regular features. They were beautiful, right. 

Q: Why do you think th at there was such a 
distance that you di
dn™t -- you didn™t see 
them, and your -- did your father go and visit them, that when 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I -- I -- he might have, I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: So you don™t know what went on? 
A: No. I never -- I never went there, yeah
. I have no id ea, I never questioned that. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
30
Q: Seems odd th at -- uh-huh. 
A: It might seem odd today, but those 
days I never questioned it. I never -- 
Q: Cause 
Przemysl
 wasn™t that far. 
A: Well, i-it -- y -- I guess it wasn™t, but we didn™t -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- we never visited. 
Q: So it was your mothe
r™s mother who was in 
Lwów
 with -- with the grandf -- the 
grandmother and grandfather was -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, my mother was the oldest of
 three siblings. She had a younger sister, 
extremely gifted, and a younger brother, wh o wa
s of course the apple of the eye of my  
grandmother, because he was a boy. And my fath
er wanted to have a 
boy, too, because of 
course, in those days you want
ed  to have somebody to say 
Ka dd ish
. In those days, and 
today too, I guess. And not necessarily only je
 -- only Jewish families, in all families you 
want a boy. 

Q: Right. Bu t your parents didn™t have another child. 

A: No. 
Q: Right? 
A: No. I guess my  mo ther decided that it wa
s too hard. I -- I don™t 
know what is the 
reason, I would speculate. 

Q: Right.  
A: Yeah. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
31
Q: Maybe one was enough. 
A: Oh, ye -- one was enough. I think it™s be
cause she was the oldest child, and she had 
the responsibility of taking 
care of the -- her youngest br
other, who was very naughty, 
and she had to run after him, and I guess she 
didn™t want to do that any more. No, she 
didn™t want to do it for me. Let™s put it this way.  

Q: Right. 
A: I mean, that I should have a sibling to comp ete with -- 
Q: Right.  

A: -- my status in my family. 
Q: Was your father older than 
your mo ther by some years? 
A: Much  older. 14 years older. I was -- 
Q: 14 years? 

A: Yeah, by 14 years older.  
Q: So that™s pretty big difference -- 
A: That was. 

Q: -- in those days. 
A: Yeah, I -- I said that I -- and -- and -- and 
I said he never played  with me because he 
was so much older, but that -- 
that really didn™t have anythi
ng to do with it, because my 
grandfather used to play with me. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
32
A: Yeah, he used to play with me, put me
 on -- well, actually, my father, when I was 
little, he w ould play with me too, and 
then I got too big,
 so he didn™t. 
Q: Right. Now, is it your mother™s 
sister who converted to Catholicism
 -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- before the war. 

A: Before the war. 
Q: Do you know -- do you kn
ow anything about this? 
A: Well, it was hushed -- hush-hush. 
Q: I bet. 
A: Yeah. I think she con -- I don™t know 
why she converted. Numb er one, she was 
extremely depressed because she went through 
a divorce. Number two,
 she couldn™t get a 
job, and she had to be inde
pendent because -- she couldn™t get a job because the Jews 
were not allowed to -- to teach, and they co
uld not wo rk in govern ment establishment -- 
establishments. So she couldn™t wo rk fo r any 
-- she had to wo rk privately, and it™s very 
har -- it was extremely  hard to work -- to get a 
job in a private institution. I don™t know if 
there were any private institutions, except if 
it were for a business. And sh e was a lawyer. 
She was a lawyer, she was very accomplished,
 very good looking, 
very elegant. She 
appeared in society pages. She did get ma
rried, but she got marri
ed to somebody who 
was -- I can ™t understand how in the world th
at happened, but it did happen, he was a 
censor for the city of -- of 
Lwów
. And censor had a very  important function, because 
they censo red, actually, the press, and -- and so
 on -- many other things. So apparently he 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
33
work  in a -- you know, in a government esta
blishment. I don™t kno
w how long, maybe he 
got fired to -- after the ™35 or ™36, I -- and I 
think this is at the 
time I think she divorced 
him shortly before the war started. I don™
t know exactly what 
year, I™m just guessing 
when it comes to the year. ™37,
 maybe? Thirty si -- eight? And it was a tragic divorce, and 
she had th e very influential friends, Catholic 
friends, so it was -- whom she spend a lot of 
time. Chances are they influen
ced her too, and she wanted -- or -- or maybe I -- I don™t 
know, I -- there was rumors she might have 
fallen in love with somebody who was not 
Jewish, and she wanted to -- she wanted to 
connect with him, and he under -- but it -- it 
didn™t happen anyway, but she also felt that sh
e wanted to do it beca use she felt solace in 
the --  

Q: In the church. 

A: In the church. She -- one tim
e she -- she told me that th
e churches are always open, 
and you can go and find th is -- 
consolation th ere. If you see,
 you can find consolation th e 
synagogue too, but I guess she di
dn™t know enough to  know that. 

Q: Right. 

A: Right, yeah. 
Q: And was she then able to wo
rk, because she had converted? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: She got a job. 
Q: As a lawyer? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
34
A: I don™t know. 
Q: Do you remember? 
A: I -- may -- 
Q: You™re not sure. 

A: I don™t remember -- I don™
t know. But she did get a job. 

Q: Did your grandmother convert as well?  
A: My moth -- I found out that my grandmot
her converted after the war, or -- because she 
wanted to  be buried near her son.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And -- and th ey -- and since he stayed in 
Poland
, and married a Polish wo man, he 
would be buried in Catholic 
cemetery. He also converted. 
Q: That™s what I was going to say. So he also converted? 
A: He also converted, about 
the same time, and -- as my -- 
Q: Your aunt. 

A: Yeah, right.  

Q: Oh. And did you know about 
this when you were a kid? 
A: I think I knew about that, yes. I knew about that. 

Q: Was it a scandal in the family, or was it 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: If it were a scandal we were not -- we di
dn™t know -- I -- I think by that time the 
contact with the other members o f the family
 was severed for financial reasons. It was 
severed befo re, the financial something or 
other. Unfo rtunately my  mo ther very  mu ch 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
35
missed her cousins, she loved th em. But it happe
ned at the higher level, in other words, it 
happened  a-at the generational level of the grandparents.  
Q: They split from -- 
A: From the other fellows. 

Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. Because that was a
nother family. My gr
andmother had two sisters. And one of 
the sisters had four children. And my  mo ther
 was very much, very 
friendly with them.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Right. Bu t wh en the grandfather broke up w
ith the rest of them, th
en the family had to 
follow. So that wa
s very sad, yeah. 
Q: Now, as you™re growing up, you are ei
ght years old when  the Nazis take over in 
Germany
. 
A: No, no, no, no, no -- 
Q: 1920 -- ™33. 
A: -- no, no, no. Oh, when they -- ye
s, yes, right, yeah, that™s true. 
Q: Right, okay. So, at some point, between 
eight years old, ™33 an
d ™39, are you he -- 
before the ger -- 

A: Oh yes, oh yes. 

Q: Are you hearing about what™s going on? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes. Not only 
that, not only that, I think in
 1913 my  mo ther had -- had a 
very dear friend who lived in 
Germany
 with her mother, and sh
e came to visit us. She 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
36
went -- she came to 
Poland
 in, I think, 1938. I think she came to 
Poland
, ch an ces are sh e 
came to 
Poland 
after the 
Kristallnacht, 
Crystal Night. And -- and -- and I-I remember 
being in the bedroom, and I rememb er they™re 
talking in the dining room, shushing one to 
the other, a-a-and it -- and it was so scary, I can™t tell you how scary it was. Whatever -- 
a-and -- and the -- what was even scarier than -- after all the horro r which sh e described 

to my mother, whatever it was 
I didn™t hear, I just felt the -- 
the tension of it. She -- she 
went back. She went back cause she didn™t want to leave her mother. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Not th at she could have been saved, because the -- 
Hitler
 would have caught up with 
her. But with us, he caught up in ™41, 
because in ™39 we 
had the Soviets.  
Q: So when this woman left, did you talk to  your mo th er and say, you know, what™s 

going on, or did you -- 

A: Well, I could ask, but my mother -- my mo
ther would never tell me horror stories. She 
would never tell me anything to  -- to scare me, 
or to -- to do anything. She -- she tried to 
make everything beautiful for 
me. So -- the parent -- the parents talked about it, I™m sure, 
but i-i -- it -- d -- you can just feel that
 -- the fe -- I was cre -- it™s cre -- you know, 
sometimes you™re more scared
 when you don™t know, right?
 So I remember being very, 
very fearful at that time, yes.
 It -- it was like a 
horror that we™re stan ding here, and you 
never -- and you didn™t know when  it woul
d come and o -- take over, right, right. 
Q: Do you start hearin g more th
ings explicitly as you get a little
 bit older, as it gets closer 
to 1939, or is it still a blur? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004

A: What happens in the -- I -- i -- we 
don™t know exactly wh at™s happening in 
Germany
, 
and we don™t know anything th at happens 
Sov i et Unio n
 because that door is co -- 
completely locked
 up and th e keys are 
thrown away. But i-in 
Poland
 itself, we have 
enough problems to cope, because there are --
 there are rumors of pogroms and they are 
not publicized, so you don™t 
know exactly, it™s strictly ru
mors. There are so-called -- 
there™s numerous clauses at the university, 
meaning that you -- the Jews cannot -- only -- 
only very limited amo unts of Jews can ente
r universities. If they already have the 
privilege of attending the universities, 
there are so-called ghetto benches at the 
universities where they have to sit separately 
at the end of the benc
h, and some students 
rebel against it, and they are being fought. A
nd I recently read some
thing I didn™t even 
know, in a book that also 
relates w h at happened in 
Lwów
, that they had razor blades 
attached to the -- to the canes
, and they would cut up people™s
 faces, in demonstrations, 
and there were many demon -- student demons
trations. And th ey used to be called 
Endecy
, plural for what -- that organiza -- organization 
[indecipherable]
 yeah. And we 
knew about it, all along. That was all known
, but life went on, y
ou know? Nobody was 
killing us, you know? Times 
were bad, but then you 
get used to bad times. 
Q: Did th ings happen  to you in your school? 
A: Noth ing happened  at my  school. 

Q: Noth ing. 

A: As a matter of fact, I was accepted to a ve
ry exclusive, private 
-- not private, public 
high school. The public high school was mo re 
exclusive than priv ate. And th ey would not 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
38
admit Jews there, very rarely
. And since my mother went to
 that high school before, and 
so did my aunt, they went and they aske
d if I could be admitted. And -- and I was 
admitted, but I wasn™t the only one, because in that year they admitted five Jewish girls, 
including me, for a class of 150. And it was f 
-- a special privilege, this -- th -- usually 
they would not admit them. What -- what wa
s so special about that school? Very  high 
level ins -- of instruction, and lower fees. Ca
use if you went into  a private school, the -- 
the schools were not public there. So there 
were only, I think two -- two high schools, 
actually. I -- I -- I knew -- I know of one public high school in 
Lwów
, and -- for girls, 
there are ya -- are many for boys, but not for gi
rls. For girls there is only one, right? And 
I had the confirmation of it, because at
 the -- our reunion -- reunion at the 10
th
 
anniversary of the 
US
 Holo caust Memorial Mu
seum, I met a woman from 
Lwó w
, and 
when I told her about 
my high school, she said, ﬁAaahh.ﬂ
 She knew what that was. So I 
had -- I felt very confirmed, yes.  
Q: And what year was that when  you we
re going to go in to that high school? 
A: I wa -- I thi -- just one y
ear, 1939. To -- 
1938 to
 1939. 
Q: So you were only there for one year? 

A: For one year in the Polish, 
and then that school -- then th
e Soviets came, and that coo -
- school remained the only Po lish school in th e c
ity. In other wo rds, where they taught the 
subjects in Polish. All the other schools we
re can -- had -- transforming to Russian 
speaking schools. So th is was the only 
school, and it became -- it was no longer 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
39
segregated and they  admitted boys, so we ha
d boy and girl -- boys and girls, but it was 
taught in Polish, except that we ha
d two hours of Russian every day. 
Q: Two. So what was that like when the 
Russians ca -- I mean, 
now you know it™s -- 
there™s a war.  
A: Oh yeah, yeah. So how™d 
it all start? I remember that
 by th at time my  grandmother 
lived in another apartment, 
and my mo ther being a very 
good daughter, and the war 
starting, she didn™t want to leave her mo ther al one, so she moved us all to her ga -- to be 

together, to her mother™s apartmen t. And that
 apartment was near a 
botanic garden, in the 
very nice area. And -- and I remember I locked
 myself up in one little bedroom, very -- 
the f -- last bedroom, and I was reading ﬁ
Gone With the Wind.ﬂ
 And since I was 
reading about 
Rhett Butler 
and 
Scarlett O™Hara
, I for -- all -- forgot all about the war. 
Q: But there was a war going on in the book. 

A: There was a war going on, but 
I was in -- I was ra -- I was in the s -- see a -- I was at -- 
living the war in between the States, yeah. I -- 

Q: Was that a very popular book in 
Euro pe
? In  
Poland
? 
A: Oh yes, it just came out
, it was extremely popular -- 
Q: Really? 

A: And how, ow -- of course
, how could it not have been? 
I -- I read in Polish because 
was already translated. 

Q: Right. Wow. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
40
A: Yeah, but you see, what ha
ppened was, it wasn™t a war. 
It was a war, and it wasn™t a 
war. Germans invaded 
Poland
, so -- and then  the Soviets invaded 
Poland
. And there was 
a 
Ribbentro p-Molo tov 
non-aggression pact. So the Poles 
had to surrender, and they had 
to s-surrender to the Soviets, 
and to -- to the Germans, and 
they stood -- the two armies 
stood in front of 
Lwów
 and we didn™t know what happen
ed. That™s how I locked myself 
up. I was a queen  of escape, you know, even  in
 those days. I -- I -- I -- this was -- I read 
to escape, that™s it. 
Q: 
Lwów
 was right close to the border -- 
A: Right -- right -- 
Q: -- right -- right there. 
A: -- on the bor --  

Q: Right.  

A: -- almost, no 
Przemysl 
was on the border.  
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: See, the Germans overran 
Przemysl. Przemysl
 was divided by the 
San 
River, as you 
know, right? So, on one side the Soviets took, had 
[indecipherable]
 and the other side 
were the Germans, and the Jews were in be
tw een, and they were 
absolutely massacred 
there, right. Yeah, first when  
they  first came, and th en the 
second time, right, was -- yeah.  
Q: So, when  did you come out of your room 
[indecipherable]
 
A: When I came out of the room, we knew 
that the ser -- the war was over, and the 
Soviets were taking over s -- s -- so
 it took me a couple of days.  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
41
Q: And -- 
A: See, it took a -- it took a very short 
time. I mean, it was couple of days, right. 
Q: Were you nerv ous about the Soviets taking over? 

A: Well, we didn™t know what do -- they -- to
 expect, but it™s not that we were happy 
about the Soviets. We were happy because th
e Germans didn™t took over -- didn™t take 
over, because that would have been  the end right there. 
Q: And that you felt at the 
time, th at this was just -- 
A: So that time, it was a -- a respite, but we
 weren™t happy at all because my  father had 
the busin ess, he was a busin essman. And th ere 
was article 11 or some
thing, protocol 11, 
article 11, all the business people had to 
be taken -- exiled, 
a-and maybe out of 
Lwów
 or 
into si -- 
Siberia
. And many were, right? So -- so my father right away gave up hi -- the 
warehouses and wh atev er he had there, a-a
nd he stopped being a 
businessman. So that 
was the end of that. 
Q: And so what did he do? 
A: He got a job as a ga -- acc
ountan t, and he work ed fo r 400 
rubles
, which is okay, but 
since my mother still didn™t wo
rk, it was not enough, and we 
-- at the end e -- I mean, we 
were starving, actually. We had no -- we had 
no inco me. It was very bad, yeah . And I wa 
-- and then I was an adolescent and I was a 
hungry adolescent, and I came down with s-
scarlet fever that I 
contacted
 in -- in a public -- public 
medical service, public clinic, 
because now th -- under the So
viets, all the medical serv
ices were free. But I got 
contaminated directly with scarlet fever, 
so I had a bad case of scarlet fever. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
42
Q: And how -- how old were y
ou -- this was 1939, or 1940? 
A: This is 19 -- end of 1
940, right. E-e-end of 19 --  
Q: You remember -- 
A: -- or maybe I wa -- ™40 -- beginning of 1941, right. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So yeah, right. 
Q: You -- you rememb er being sick? 
A: Oh, I remember it very 
well, I wa -- almo st died. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah, it was terrible. I remember being in
 a hospital, I reme mb er the docto rs coming 
in, and I remember my mother 
visiting me after six weeks or 
so, and when sh
e looked at 
me she got scared because my 
-- I was as skinny as they  co
me. My mother was skinnier 
too, maybe skinnier than I was. She lost fi
 -- tw -- 20 kilos, whic
h means 40 pounds, at 
the time I was sick. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, yeah, because she was 
so scared that she might lose
 me, I was very dangerously 
ill. So, but that served us well, when
 the Germans came in. We used it.  
Q: All right, we -- why don™t we stop th e tape, and we™ll start right there. 

A: Okay . 
End of Tape Two 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
43
Beginning Tape Three 
Q: All right, we™re going to come back to th
e scarlet fever story and the Germans, and 
how that saved you, but I wa
nt to go back a little bit, because there™s a part of the 
conversion story that you didn™t
 tell us before, mainly about
 your grandfather. Can you -- 
A: Oh, right. Well, i-it happened, I think, 
1937 maybe, wh en my  bos -- my  aunt and my  
uncle were very desperate, wit
hout a job. Especially my  aunt, because sh -- as I said, she 
went thro ugh a divorce that was very painful.
 And so  my  grandfather reme mb ered that he 
had a friend closely connected to 
Marshal Pi -- Pilsudski. 
And so he went to  see him 
and -- in 
Wa rsa w
, and to ask him if he could help f 
-- to find the -- the job for both of 
them, for my aunt and my uncle. And he told
 my  grandfather that he could not because 
they were not -- they were 
Jewish, and there was no way he
 could do it. Should th ey 
convert, that would be possible. And -- and th
at™s what happened. Bu t as far as my  aunt 
was concerned, she was very desperate, a
nd she -- and she was -- and she could have 
been on the verge of suicide 
because I think maybe with he
r romantic disenchantments, 
as well as b ecause she couldn™
t be independent. So sh e 
converted, and sh e stayed 
converted. So that™s what 
happened. And -- but they  both 
got jobs. I know my  uncle 
didn™t get a job in 
Lwów
, but he got a job in another town  in 
Poland
. 
Q: So do you th ink your gran
dfather converted because -- 
A: My grandfather never converted . 
Q: Did -- didn™t convert. But -- 
A: Grandfather never co nverted. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
44
Q: -- the uncle converted in order to get a job, you think. 
A: I-I have a feeling that that could have 
been the reason, right, 
yeah. But he was so 
assimilated that it -- it -- I don™t thi
nk it made mu ch difference for him.  
Q: Right. 

A: You -- they were very assimilated. Th
ey  never spoke anything but Po lish in  their 
household, even in th e older generation li -- 
level. My father sp
oke Yiddish, but my 
mo ther did not.  

Q: I see. 

A: And she didn™t -- I don™t think she knew ho
w. So I -- so in her 
household, apparently 
they didn™t speak yi -- I don™t know if my
 grandmother spoke Yiddish or not, but she 
never spoke it. 

Q: So one difference one can see in 
Poland,
 in terms of the anti-Se
mitism is that it wasn™t 
really racial. Because if a Jew converted, 
they were considered to be Catholic. 
A: Yes, you might say that, but -- 

Q: But -- 

A: You might say that, but -- but because in terms of -- o f conversion and getting job, that 
was one thing, but you were
 always who you were, no ma
tter what. If people knew you 
as a Jew, y ou stayed a Jew. 
Mendelsohn
 with his cross on his grave is still a Jew to all 
Germans, so was 
[indecipherable]
 and he -- even though 
he converted. So -- 
Q: So it was the same in 
Poland
? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
45
A: Oh, absolutely. Except 
if they didn™t know it. If they didn
™t know it, it just as with that 
boy, he didn™t know I was Jewish, I was a -- 
we could have been the best of friends. Bu t 
once he knew it, it was the end.  
Q: Right. 

A: Right. That™s how it was. 

Q: Now, one mo re question, because when  
we took th e break you told me some thing 
about your mother that I di
dn™t know, that she had gone to conservatory, but hadn™t 
finished.  

A: Right, she went to  conservato ry and she 
went, and she studied education in -- in the 
university, but she dropped out, and I -- I think sh
e dropped out to -- in order to  help th  -- 
her parents make the ends meet, which coul
d never happen an yway . Bu t she wanted to  
lower her own burden on th em. And th en I th
ink that the marriage of my parents was 

arranged. I didn™t know it, but it was probab
ly a matchmaking kind of deal. In other 
words, they were -- it was a 
shidach,
 if you know the word 
shidach
. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Right. 
Q: So did your parents 
get along, do you think, as far as y ou -- 
A: Well, the thing is that I never knew th
at. I never knew that, that the marriage was 
arranged. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
46
A: I knew then -- a-as a matter of fact, 
I couldn™t understand how come my  mother 
married my  father, because he was much older 
than she was. And then
 she told me that 
in-initially she was dating a -- a -- a dental stude
nt, and -- but in order to marry the dental 
student, she had to have a dowry , because de
ntal students need a dowry to establish 
themselves, and there was no do
wry. No t that kind of a dowr
y. There was a dowry , had to 
be a dowry, but not that kind of
 a d owry .  S o  my  mo - mo th er 
didn™t marry him. I think sh e 
liked him, she took me as 
a patient to him one time. 
Q: Yeah? 
A: Yeah, and I liked him too, he was -- he was cute.  
Q: So did your mo th er talk
 to you about the marriage? 
A: No, never. 
Q: She never did. 

A: Never, never. I found that out by accident
 from the letters that I have read, maybe -- 
maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, 
I don™t remember, that were written to my 
aunt. She died recently, I don™t 
know when  she died, I -- I ca
 -- I have no notion of time 
passing. And in those letters my father desc
ribes a situation in wh
ich he was to marry 
somebody else. And he was very fond of th at
 other person, but something came up, and 
he broke the engagement. He broke the 
engagement. Somebody 
offended him. And 
shortly after that, he married my mother. So
 I say, how in the world did he marry my 
mother? So I -- I™m guessing that it was a 
shi d ach
. I mean s -- a situation in which the ma 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
47
-- marriage is arranged, pre-arranged, right. So 
those are these family stories, each family 
has it™s secrets. But I didn™t know 
it. I didn™t know it until just now. 
Q: Really, just recently? 
A: I mean in 
America
, right. 
Q: Uh-huh. Do you rememb er your mo ther singing? 

A: Oh, of course. I was bro
ught up on all the operas. 
Q: Yes? 

A: Of course. My mother sang ﬁ
Madama Butterfly,ﬂ
 and she sang ﬁ
La Traviata,ﬂ  
and 
she sang the 
ﬁRosenka valier
,ﬂ and sh e sang everything you want. 
Q: So sh e really had a cultivated voice. 

A: Oh, she had a magnificent lyric soprano voice. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes, yes. As a matter of fact, she used to
 like to tell me how as
 she once sang by open 
window and a gentleman asked her if she is 
a-an opera singer, and she was so flattered. 
Q: Did you go to concerts, as a kid? 

A: I went a -- yes, I went to the operas. 
Q: You did. 
A: And I didn™t have to go to my  mo ther 
[indecipherable]
 my  aunt had th e recitals in 
their -- her apartment, she 
sang a -- what did she sing? 
Schubert
, I think, yeah. 
Q: So your aunt, her 
sister, played piano? 
A: Oh, my  mo ther played piano too. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
48
Q: Oh, your mo ther played piano, too? 
A: Oh su re, of course she played piano. If 
you would sing, you have to play piano. Bu t 
she played  mo stly from hearing, you know? 

Q: By ear. 

A: By ear, yes, she played by 
ear but she read notes too, I 
mean, if she wanted, she read 
notes. And -- and my aunt sang well. I reme
mber sittin g at one of her recitals. They 
opened th e -- all the rooms, like that. And -- and s -- 

Q: That must have been exciting. 

A: And she sat in the room wh en th ere wa
s light coming from the balcony, an d that was 
very exciting, yes. I was very proud. 

Q: Could you -- can you si
ng? Did you get a voice? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: They were waiting for me to s -- 
to -- to ma-mature, and to sing.  
Q: Didn™t happen. 
A: Didn™t happen. It didn™t happen . No
, I ha -- well, number one, I had the 
mezzo
 voice, I 
didn™t have a soprano, I was not a soprano. 
But I -- I could carry a tune pretty well. Not 
any more. Excuse me, I n
eed to drink the water. 
Q: Sure. Well, that™s an interesting side
light. Okay, let™s go to your scarlet fever. 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: How does the scarlet fever -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
49
A: Yes. 
Q: -- protect you when the Nazis come? 
A: You know, when  Nazis came
, they also had the carte bl
anche to go to -- to Jewish 
houses and do whatev er they 
want. Take out what they  
wanted, do what they  want. 
Q: Right. 
A: So what my mother did -- 
I don™t know if maybe it was my  idea -- is -- probably had 
to be my mother™s idea, and the -- what di
d she do, she -- she put a sign on the bedroom 
door, 
sharla -- sharla fe -- 
feber. Sharla feber
. Meaning scarlet fever. So whoever want 
the -- if the soldiers came in 
and saw that sign, they ran. You know, Germans were pretty 
sanitary people, they  didn™t want to get in
volved in. Sometimes it didn™t wo rk. One time 
it didn™t work. A guy came in, he was inebriated, I have to say, and as he was inebriated, 

he decided he wants to -- he wants to sit at 
the table and have cup of tea. So, he just -- 
you know, we had to  do wh at 
he says, there was no such  thing as say no except one time 
my  father did say no, which was 
absolutely heroic. An
d so he -- he sat with the table, he 
had his tea. And I was -- as I was recovering fr
om s-scarlet fever, I lost all my hair. Yes, I 
di -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- I lost hair, completely. And -- not comple
tely, but almost completely. But as it -- the 
hair grew in , and -- and I -- previously  I had the 
straight hair, that hair grew in curly. So I 
was pretty cute, and I was pretty young. A
nd I couldn™t speak German, so I didn™t say a 
word . Bu t my  parents, of course, talked Ge
rman. I -- I don™t know wh at they had -- he 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
50
had to say, I don™t -- I don™t rememb er I und
erstood. And wh at happened  was he s -- he 
sat for quite some time, he drank his tea, a
nd he asked fo r soap. So  my  mo ther gave him 
some soap, wif -- we had soap, and he -- then 
he left. And he said, 
ﬁYou can be proud of 
your daughter,ﬂ to them. I don™t know wh at he 
had in mind. As I said he was drunk, so -- 
so that™s an episode. In that 
episode, tha -- after that episode
, we decided we -- we -- and 
as the time went on, it wasn™t 
good to be sick for a Jew, 
because sick Jews were dead 
Jews, sooner or later. So we -- we
 did not use the sign any mo re.  
Q: Do you remember when
 the Germans came into 
Lwów
 -- 
A: Oh, sure I do. 
Q: -- in June? 
A: I remember, I was standing in th
e balcony watching them come in . 
Q: What was that like? 

A: That was -- that was -- I can™t tell you. 
It was very, very, very scary. And they 
marched in in a column, and it -- I -- if
 I recall cor -- if I recall correctly, 
Gródecka 
has 
cobblestones, too. So th ey marched on the 
cobblestones, and you co
uld hear them ma rch 
in boots, marching boots, yes. And I was -- 
and th at balcony was my  favorite spot, 
because I used to read on that balcony. You 
know, there was a space 
for a chaise lounge, 
and you could lie down  and get 
suntan and do everything, and -- and we -- that™s what I 
used to do, and -- and that™s what 
I did that particular day. On a 
[indecipherable]
 I think 
it was on the 20 -- I don™t know wh at date
, it was a -- the end of June, I think. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
51
A: Because the war started on the 23
rd
 of June of ™41, an d I think that™s when it was when  
they marched in, or shortly after, because 
Lwó w
 was very close. And -- 
Q: And you were living on 
Gródecka
? 
A: We were not on 
Gródecka, 
off 
Gródecka. 
Q: Were off 
Gródecka. 
A: Off 
Gródecka
. It was a small street, so you 
could see from the balcony as they 
marched on 
Gródecka, 
could see 
Gródecka. 
Q: What were you afraid of, do you th ink? 
When  you say you were afraid when you saw 
them, what -- 
A: Y-You -- what you were 
afraid of, you were afraid 
of what you didn™t know. You 
knew they  had concentration camps. There was 
Kristallnacht. 
Of course, we didn™t 
know that there was much wo
rse than that. That we didn
™t know. No body knew then. 
Nine -- although we knew more, I think because 
after all, 1941, there 
-- they were already 
in 
Poland
, and in 
Warsaw
, and in the western part -- part of 
Poland
. However, I don™t 
think there was that much comm
unication because of the Soviet
s. And the other thing, we 
were so preoccupied with our s --
 
penury
, 
we were poor, we really, you know, wh en I got 
sick and my  grandmother came to -- to see -- 
to visit me, and she went -- she was there all 
day and she wanted to  eat something, she we
nt to the -- to the c
upboard and there was 
nothing there. She realized that we had no 
food. And I -- and the -- 
and she didn™t know 
that we ha -- apparently my mother was al
ways good at giving, but never on taking, 
because she didn™t know my moth
er didn™t have food to -- 
with her family. A-And they 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
52
did, because in that family, my  grandfat
her worked, my aunt 
worked, and my uncle 
work ed under 
the Soviets. 
Q: Right. 
A: Right. So I™d -- so after I -- when I wa s getting better, all my mother was feeding me 

was farina. I was getting fat on 
farina, which were very good
, and my mother served it 
with butter, it was great. Right. That™s 
what I was eating most of the time.  
Q: That first month was very difficult when 
the Germans came in because there were -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- pogroms right away. 
A: Yeah, and I had to -- 
Q: Right 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Yeah right. 

Q: Yes. 
A: But I want to finish that other part -- 
Q: Sure. 

A: -- about the scarlet fever. So -- and I wa
s recuperating from scarlet fever, I wasn™t 
allowed to go out or anything, God fo rbid
, 
and -- and the -- that June 23
rd
, which was 
Sunday, I was -- that was my fi
rst day out, supposed to have
 been, and I was going to go 
to the pool, and meet all my  cous -- high sc
hool friends. And lo and behold, the Germans 
stopped it. On th at day, the Germans started th
e invasion. So that was the end of everyth -

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
53
- not every -- well, that was an end of ever
ything, actually. Right. 
So  could you rephrase 
your question 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Well, what I was going -- there was no fighting in  
Lwó w
, they just came in  -- 
A: There wa -- there was -- 
Q: -- or was there fight -- 

A: -- there was no fight -- there was very littl
e fighting. I think there was some bombing 
maybe, of the airport, but the -- 
the -- the -- the Russians withdrew. 
Q: Uh-huh, very quickly. 

A: Russians withdrew very quick ly. And some 
people went with them. Some people went 
with them, but golly , we wouldn™t -- how coul
d we? I mean -- right. My mother was very 
attached to her mo ther, but that wouldn™t apply 
in that case anyway. 
But my father before 
the war offered my  mother, maybe you 
sh ould go and join
 his family in 
America
. And 
my  mo ther and I witn essed th
at. My mother said, ﬁAnd ho
w could I leave my mother?ﬂ 
Q: Uh-huh. Not how could I leave you, but how could I leave my  mother, yeah . 

A: Right. And how could I leave my mother. An
d so that was the end of that, yeah. And -
- and my  father and my  mo ther had very good
 relations except for the financial things, 
because my mother always wa
nted to help her family, a-
and -- and -- and my father 
yielded to  this, and did, to his own ruin. And th at was -- yeah. 

Q: So he gave mo ther 
to -- money, rather -- 
A: No, he didn™t give any money, but she trie
d to help the family. He hired people from -- 
from my mother™s family. He purchased debt 
ridden realty to alleviate the debts, and it 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
54
turned out that they
 were so indebted that the -- the -- 
that he didn™t even know the debts 
were -- that were -- were on that property, ri
ght. He was -- yeah, it was. It was a ver -- 
horrendous, yeah. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right.  

Q: But by the time the Germans come, yo
ur father doesn™t have a business. 
A: No, by the time the Russi
ans come he already ha -- there™s no business. 
Q: Right. 

A: But there is also no income, because the 400 
rubles
 for a family is not enough. And 
my mother never worked, so
 sh -- I guess she didn™t kn
ow how to -- how to work. 
Q: Now does your father stand up to the 
Germans very quick ly? Is there a scene? 
A: Yes, right, oh my father™s di -- well, I -- 
I told you that the Je
wish apartments were 
free for all, any time. And so  one time we had two 
S.S.™s
 barge in, and they didn™t care 
too mu ch  about other things, 
but they wanted to -- to ha
ve my father -- there was a 
daybed, horsehair filled 
daybed that they liked, 
so they pointed to it 
and told my father 
[speaks German here]
. He -- they started it with a 
Z-
form, you know, 
Z-
form is a form 
of -- form in German. And my father said 
[speaks German]
. And he was short, you 
know, my father. A-And he stood 
[indecipherable]
 like this, and he pointed at the 
picture on the wall. And he said 
[speaks German]
. So what does th
e officer do? He 
grabs him by a neck and he says yes, 
truk -- 
no, how did he say it, he didn™t use the 
Z-

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
55
form any more, he said 
[speaks German]
. So my father -- so, what happens, and -- and 
he starts to pulling out, he holds him like 
this and starts to pull out his revolver. 
Q: The German is pulling out his revolver. 
A: Revolver. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So what does my  mo ther do -- and I have to
 describe what these 
two officers look like. 
I -- I had a young ey e, you know, I was a teen
ager, and they looked 
very handsome. They 
were tall, and blonde. They  had 
[indecipherable]
 hanging down  here. They had those 
blue green unifo rms in be -- and scary, scary 
S.S.™s
 on that black background, right on 
here -- 

Q: Right here? 

A: -- around the neck . And -- but my  mo ther goe
s in the back, you ca
n imagine scene, he 
holds my  father by th e throat, and my  mo ther 
goes in back of him a
nd pulls his tunic as 
he™s taking the revolver out. 

Q: She pulls the tunic of the German? 

A: Yes, yes. So the German d-doesn™t know
 what™s happening, 
he™s turning around, 
there™s my  mo ther. So I -- I -- he gets furious
, and then  I look at him, I look at him with 

all the hate that I could mu ster, I have to tell 
you. So -- so he sees me
 with that hatred in 
my  eyes, and he has to take out his hands, so
 he slaps me, and I ro -- and he throws me 
into the corn er, you know. Bu t,
 in the meantime, someh o w, 
the guy, other, comes to him 
and they -- and they leave.  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
56
Q: All right, go back a little bit. N o w translat
e what™s being said between the German and 
your father and your father to 
the German. What is it he says? 
A: Well, he says to my father, bring this down.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And my father says, ﬁI™m not going to br
ing it down, I™m an Austrian officer, and I™m 
not going to  bring it down .ﬂ And he points to 
the picture on the wall, telling that he™s not 
going to  bring it down, that™s it. Because he™s 
an officer. So the other guy gets mad, that 
here™s a 
[speaks German]
 I don™t know how the 
[indecipherable]
 cursed Jews. 
Perflukten
 means probably -- 
Q: Cursed j -- 

A: Cursed -- cursed Jew. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I think. I-I™m not sure. 
Q: Like a damn Jew. 
A: Damn Jew, damn Jew is better. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Right. So a-an -- h -- so he changes the fo
rm of address, he doesn™t -- h-he -- he uses 
do
, means you know, the differenc
e between thou and you, I gue
ss. And in English that™s 
the -- th-the difference, I imagine. 
Q: So th en he orders him?  
A: He orders him to take it down. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
57
Q: Yeah, right. 
A: And my father insists that
 he™s not going to  take it down
, because he is an Austrian 
officer. And at that time, he™s ch  -- he st
arts taking -- you know, 
they all have this 
tendency, do that thing. They
 -- they can grab you, I -- I 
guess. Anyway, so my father 
didn™t bring it down, they left. 

Q: Now your mother is doing something that™s very peculiar. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So sh e™s holding him -- 

A: Pulling him away -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- I mean, of course. She -- she pulls away
 because h -- she ge -- young -- whatever it 
is, it was an instantaneous reaction. 

Q: Right, right. 
A: But you can imagine 
the courage of this? 
Q: No, I can™t because I also -- you™re 
very lucky that you weren™t all shot. 
A: Right, right, right, right, because they were 
S.S. -- S.S.™s.  
Q: But do you rememb er when th ese guys 
left? You -- were you th ree sort of -- 
A: I -- I -- I was very sho -- yeah
, I was very much in shock.  
Q: I would imagine, yeah. 
A: I was very much in shock, yeah. 
A-and -- and th ey must have had other 
considerations, but in that com -- th
at will come from other -- from other 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
58
[indecipherable]
 stories, so I don™t want to -- yo
u know, they did it -- this was illegal 
what they  were doing, in a wa
y. They  -- they  could do it, a
nd yet th -- you know, I don™t 
know how legal it was 
for them to do it. 
Q: Right, right.  
A: Officially -- officially. 

Q: So th ey have do it carefully. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Right. 

A: So maybe they didn™t want
 to leave c-cadavers behind th
em. I have no idea, I just -- 
they just -- at that time I was so drained, I -- th
ey just left, that™s it,
 and they -- my father 
didn™t take it down, no. 

Q: So now what happens? 

A: So I don™t know where we are. Are we -- 
Q: We™re in June, we™re still in June 
A: In June, the Soviets ca-came in, so the life 
started under the Soviets, so I went back to  
school, and it was like a school that was -- 
Q: You mean the Germans 
came in, so you were -- 
A: Oh, now we talking about 
Germans, or the Soviets? 
Q: I thought we -- 

A: Oh, we still ba -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
59
Q: Aren™t we still in 
Germany
? I mean, the Germans have ta
ken over, they came in in 
1941. 
A: All right, so now, okay, all right. You see, I 
have to be brought to 
all that. So -- yeah -- 
Q: Is there something abou
t the Soviets you want to say that you didn™t say? 
A: No, no, I -- not that I reme
mber, really. No, because it wa
s a go -- I -- I remember very 
dreary life under the Soviets. 

Q: Dreary? 
A: Very dreary. 

Q: But not dangerous? 
A: Not dangerous, no. Oh, well, in a way it 
was somewhat dangero us
, because you had to 
-- I remember th-the -- having an understandi
ng with my girlfriends 
that if anybody ever 
stopped us, we would ha
ve a tale to tell, and it should be
 the same tel -- tal -- tale. Cause 
we, of course, we were talking against the government. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yeah. And I had to learn th
e Constitution, and I had a very  bad grade, I couldn™t learn 
the Constitution. Constitution was a one -- a ve
ry -- Soviet Constitution is a wonderful 
piece of -- document. It gives you all the 
rights you can imagine, 
right. But you don™t 
have, right.  

Q: Now why was it dreary, or dull? 

A: Well, for one thing it -- I -- it was dr
eary for many reasons. Fo
r economic reasons, 
because there was no money, 
for food even. And 
for other reason, because I was an 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
60
adolescent and that was a -- hard to be a 
[indecipherable]
 it would have been hard 
anyway, probably, an ywhere. Bu t it was a -- y
ou see, it™s -- how did I -- how did I put it? 
I put it™s hard to be an  adolescent, it™s ev
en harder to be a hungry adolescent.  
Q: Mm-hm, right. 
A: Right. 

Q: Do -- do you remember a lo
t of refugees coming into  
Lwów
 during that time? 
A: Oh yes, our family did. My  grandfather™s
 family came. And they were -- shortly after, 
they were deported. They were deport to 
Siberia
, which saved their lives.  
Q: Mm. 
A: How did they get deported? Because life fo
r refugees, it was very difficult, because it 
was difficult for other people too, many other pe
ople, and as a refugee they didn™t have a 
-- apartments, and so on and so forth, so it™s 
even harder for them. 
And so  there was a -- I 
don™t know how to describe it -- the Soviet ran 
a survey, and they  asked people what they 

are going to do after the war. Would they go b
ack to their homes in 
the previous location, 
or would they want to  stay under the benevo
lent Soviet rule? That wasn™t in the paper, 
I™m adding it up. A-And so, mo st people, a 
lot of people, many people, thousands of 
people signed up they  want 
to go back to th eir 
apartments and recover their possessions. 
All these people within, I think,
 24 hours, were deported. And -- but th-the Soviets didn™t 
intend to save them, they inte
nded to punish them. But even
tually that was the case.  
Q: Because they were Jewish. 
A: Most of these people came back. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
61
Q: Came back, right. So when 
the Germans take over, and it™s -- 
A: The Germans didn™t take a -- start to -- th
ey give carte blanche to the Ukrain ians.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: And the Ukrainians barge in
to  people™s houses, or even catch them on the street, and 
take them to the prisons -- prisons. And I wa
s most familiar with the prisons that was 

across the street from my fath
er™s office. Except my fath
er wasn™t there any more, 
because the office was surrendere
d as the Soviets came in . 
Q: Right. 

A: So -- so they ri -- ri -- th
-they would beat them up, or they made them dig graves for 
the o -- I don™t know, they make -- made them
 dig graves for the people that the Soviets 
killed, or they made them dig up the graves 
-- the -- the shallow grav
es that the Soviets 
buried their people in there. You know, whoever that was. 

Q: Right. And what was the name of the pr
ison that was near your father™s work? 
A: Oh, th -- th -- they di 
-- that was the -- I think that
 -- that was a nickname, was 
Brygidki
, but that was a nickname, there was pr
obably an official name, yeah, right.  
Q: And did you know also that the 
Ukrainians were massacring Jews? 

A: Of cour -- that -- yes, yes. 
Q: You did. Yes, you did. 

A: They did, yeah. At that 
time it was the mob. And don™t 
-- and of course the Germans 
incited this, they incited the m
ob, they gave them their right
. I don™t know exactly if the 
Petliura 
Days happened right after they came, or 
they came and they happened at the end 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
62
of the month. Bu t 
Petliura 
was the man who was assassi n ated by a Jewish boy, 1926, 
actually, because they killed 
his parents in the pogrom. 
Q: Right. 
A: He killed -- he was a notori
ous leader, anti-Semitic leader. 
Q: 
Petliura 
occurs in jan -- July 25
th
, or something like that.  
A: I -- I know, but -- 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: -- that™s -- but they had the -- they
 had riots right the first two days -- 
Q: Before, right, right. 

A: -- maybe under another name. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right. And they -- the others were
 repeated again, but I -- I can™t -- 
Q: Did you ever see violence? 
A: I did not see -- well, I did see 
violence, but not at that point. 
Q: Not at that -- that™s what 
I™m wondering, at that point. 
A: No, not at that point. 

Q: Okay . 
A: I mu -- I -- I didn™t leave the house, 
period. Once the Germans came in -- 
Q: You stayed in the house. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
63
A: See, you remember I was an adolescent w
ho wa -- who was kept in the house because 
of sickness, now 
[indecipherable]
 adolescent kept in the house because of danger. So, I 
didn™t -- I -- for months, first few 
months I didn™t come out at all. 
Q: Right. 
A: But I was studying. 

Q: You were studying? 
A: Yeah. I had to do something, right? Yeah , yeah. I have to tell you about studying, how 
I came to study wh at I was studying.  

Q: Okay, we™re going to have to stop the tape. 
A: Okay . 
Q: And w -- and we™ll do it next -- for the next time. 

A: Excuse me. 

Q: Studying, okay. 
End of Tape Three

Beginn ing Tape Four 
Q: 
Janine
, I wanted to go back just for a minut
e because at lunch you mentioned cats, 
that you had had cats through most of your childhood -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- including when  y
ou were in the ghetto. 

A: It wasn™t in the ghetto. 
Q: It was before. 
A: It was before we went to the ghetto, in
 the ghetto we had no -- I don™t know there was 
space or food for animals, I didn™t see any. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: But I -- we had them in our apartment, an
d I don™t know how we got
 that little cat, but 
we did. And even though my fa -- my father
 initially objected to my
 spending too much 
time with cats, di -- didn™t ha
ve nothing against that little cat. It was a very poor little 
thing, and it -- it barely lived, it was so littl
e. And what happened 
was one night -- and it 
was, I think a Friday night before Monday ro
und-up, when this cat got enta -- I think 
overn ight, got entangled in bed linens and we 
found him dead in the 
morning. And for us 
it was a bad omen. And not only that we were
 sorry for the little ca
t because he was so 
helpless, but it was like a metaphor for our own futu re. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Right. So  it was -- you know, 
was kind of, very sad, right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
65
Q: Now you said that when  the Germans came 
in, your parents or your -- your mo ther in 
particular wouldn™t let you go out 
of the house, so you were studying. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What were you doing? 

A: And how did I -- well, I studied from the 
books I already had, 
first. And by happy 
circumstan ce, we shared a -- we shared a ba
throom with another fa
mily, on th -- the -- on 
-- outside of the apartment itself. And in t
hose days we had no to ilet paper, so what we 
used was newspaper, mo stly. And one day, 
while in the washroom, I saw pages from 
books. And -- and they -- it looked like very in
teresting books. So  I went to my neighbor 
and I told  her that I provide her with all the 
newspapers I can if she gives me the books. 
And I ended up with 20 volume worl
d history and a magnificent edition of 
Schiller
, 
complete works of 
Schiller
, illustrated. 
Q: Really? 
A: Right. And I spend th e time I had just st
arting the world history, th at™s why I™m so 
good in history, you see.  
Q: So you can thank 
the Germans for this. 
A: Well, I wouldn™t thank the Germans -- 

Q: No, for anything. 

A: -- not for this -- 

Q: Right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
66
A: -- not for this, not for anything else. I woul
d be very  pleased learning history on my  
own. 
Q: Right.  
A: Right. And so  -- and I did, and I -- I studi
ed French from the book
s I had, but I didn™t 
have any books, so I didn™t learn mu ch Fren
ch. Cause I had the -- I remember I -- I had 
two volume, from the two volume some kind 
of a romance novel I only had one. So -- 
and I think his name was 
Edgar Feuillet
, 
Feuillet,
 he was very popular at a certain time. 
Very popular -- popular author. Ra -- light
 fiction, of course. And -- but I loved 
Schiller
 
was magnificent. Everything was in Polish, of 
course. And -- and I -- I can list you all the 
plays that I read, and 
ﬁJoan of Arcﬂ 
and ﬁ
Fiesco of Genoa,ﬂ 
I think. I don™t know, 
maybe it has another title. And ﬁ
The Robbers,ﬂ
 the most famous, I think. A-And with all 
kinds of quotations that are world famous. And I 
loved it, so I -- that -- well, I lo ved that -

- that -- I can say that the -- the -- the -- th
e round-ups raged outsi
de, and I was reading 
Schiller
. And my  mo th er -- and one day I -- and 
I was very, very -- I -- I showed my 
disconten t and I was telling my  mo ther, ﬁHow 
can I ever go to university if I can™t go 
even to high school?ﬂ And my  mo ther looked at
 me as if I were from another planet. And 
I probably  knew I was from another planet, but
 I did it anyway, I -- I studied. I studied, I 

spend a whole day doing all -- studying, readi
ng mo stly. Yeah. An d what happened i -- in 
the meantime my fath er had a job, he went to 
his job in construction. He had the same  job 
from the beginning and he was the one who was provided with the 
Ausweiss. Ausweiss,
 
which is the certificate -- work certificate. As
 youknow significance 
work certificates in 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
67
those days. And he work ed in 
constructions. I don™t think he
 was a -- a builder himself, 
but he apparently supervised 
the -- whatever there was, or
 did them. Maybe he did the 
payroll for the Polish worker -- 
workers. He might have work ed
 th en as a payroll person. 
But he -- his title was 
Bau Secretaire. 
Q: 
Bau Secretaire. 
A: 
Bau
 meaning building. 
Secretaire
 - secretary. Excuse me. 
Q: And he had that job from when the German
s came, or this was the same job that -- 
A: No, no, I think it was -- I have 
no id ea actually -- I wouldn™t -- 
Q: You don™t know? 
A: -- I -- I never ask that question myself. I 
think it mu st have been  another job. I -- I 
don™t know. I really don™t know. But it was fa r away and of course, Jews could not -- s-
soon after the Germans came in, there -- ther
e were no schools, there were no rights to 

use public transportation. We had to wear 
an armb and, wh ich had to be wide. And -- 
wide, pretty wide, yes. With the blue 
Magen Davidz
 on it.  
Q: And did you wear it on your right
 sleeve or your left sleeve? 
A: On the right sleeve. 
Q: On the right sleeve. 
A: Right, on the 
right sleeve, yeah. 
Q: But when they came 
in, when  you had to put that on,
 it was summer. So did you have 
to wear it if your arms were bare? Do you rememb er? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
68
A: They didn™t care how th ey wear -- how you 
were wearing, you had to wear them, so 
you wo re probably shorter sleeves, and you di
dn™t wear a -- but you had to wear them, if 
you didn™t wear them, or -- a
nd you were caught, then  -- th
ey -- you -- that was a death 
penalty right there, or they beat you 
to  death or wh atever they would do. 
Q: So you didn™t sew it on, you simp ly pu
t it on fo r each of -- piece of clothing. 
A: Well, it -- i-it -- whatever it was, depending 
on the nature of the 
-- the -- of the clo -- 
clothes you were wearing, or type
 of garment you were wearing. 

Q: And where did you get them from, do you reme mb er? 

A: No. I -- I remember that they were c
overed with plastic, some of them, yes. 
Q: Really? 

A: That the fabric was covered with plastic
 and that was made mo re sewed, and they 
could have a snap. They were not all fr -- ma de from fabric. They were made from fabric, 

but the fabric -- excuse me -- was protected.
 Fabric was protected with plastic. That™s 
what I rememb er, yes. Yeah. An
d that -- you know this th -- th
is -- th-this time, I mean, in 
the beginning, it was when  my  cousin  was take
n and -- and beaten so horrible. But he -- 
he survived the war. 
Q: And what was his name? 
A: Dr
. Hertzel. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: He was a lawyer, but he had a de -- a -- 
you know, he study, he had post-doctorate 
studies.

Q: And where were you living? 
A: We were living the same apartment. 
Q: You were? 
A: All the time. At that time. In that tim
e, that was right after the Germans came in. 
Q: Right. 

A: A few months after. And we
 kept living in the same ap
artment until such time when 
they told  us that everybody has to move to
 the ghetto. And whoever 
-- yeah, in that time 
we were seeking other means of staying. And 
this is at that time 
that my  grandfather 
more or less was killed. Because what happen
ed was that the younge
r people had to go to 
work . And with the ordinance of everybody 
going to  the ghetto, somebody had to go and 

arrange for an apartment. No 
-- you could not arrange for an 
apartment, there was no such 
thing as apartment. Y ou can arrange for a 
place to sleep , because the ghetto was made 
small. And -- and that was ve
ry difficult because you had 
to buy your place from -- to 
sleep from somebody who was there already. 
From the people who occupied the place. 

You could buy it either from the Poles, or -- 
who had apartments in
 the ghetto still, or 
from the Jews who owned the apartments, an d 
you could rent, sublet, some other place. 
And we had no money, because w-we did a foo
lish th ing. If we had some gold, either we 
didn™t sell at the right time or we had to give
 it away when they aske
d for the con -- th-the 
Germans asked fo r the contributions. And we 
had to su rrender all the fur coats, or e-
everything. You could not own 
furs, you can own -- you cannot
 own the radios. And that 
was in the first months, I think. And I rememb
er we had a very nice and friendly Pole, we 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
70
sold the radio to him. And he was very ni
ce and friendly guy. And it was shortly after 
Pearl Ha rb or,
 because we hear -- I remember hearing 
Pearl Ha rb or 
announcements on 
the radio. And oh, we were so happy, not because the 
Pearl Harbor 
was bombed, but 
because the Americans were -- entered the war 
and if they entered the war they will win 
and we will survive and we™ll live. That™s what
 we thought. I rememb
er even the place I 
stood at to -- to listen to the radio. 
Q: Where were you? 
A: I was in front of the Venetian mirror and 
the radio was kitty corner from me, and I was 
there, and we were so amazed 
and then we came closer to 
the radio to hear it again and 
again, right. A-An -- and th en this guy ca
me, and -- and he was telling us -- and a -- I 

mu st have -- he mu st have been very careful to
 tell us what he told us, he said we should 
get out. We should do somethi
ng to get out, because he witnessed the place where he saw 
a field covered with armbands
. And he didn™t say 
he -- he witnessed a killing field, he 
just said he witnessed seeing the armbands, a
nd let us fill in the rest. And well, the thing 
is, we believed him, and we didn
™t want to believe him. I thin
k in bottom of our hearts we 
knew wh at he was saying, but
 we had no place to go and 
in order to go so mewhere you 
had to have means. Y
ou couldn™t just go.  
Q: Right. 

A: You couldn™t get out of town . The only 
way you could do is to get papers and live 
under another name. That was the only th
ing you could do. I-I -- I don™t think we 
contemplated that yet, it was too early. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
71
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Right, yeah. 
Q: Were you st -- were you in the r
oom wh en he came in and said this? 
A: Oh yes, yeah. 
Q: You -- so you heard him. 

A: I heard him. I heard say that. And then  I 
er -- I told him, I -- 
I a sk  my  mo ther, ﬁDid  
you hear what he said?ﬂ And my  mo ther said
, ﬁOh, don™t worry. That
™s not true.ﬂ See, 
my  mo th er was b eing  my  mo th er.  

Q: Did you still believ e him? 
A: Oh, I did. We all did. 
I™m sure we did. But we -- 
you know, what™s the use of 
believing? Should we commit su
icide right there and then? What could we do? I mean 
there was no -- there was no exit. There just was no exit. 
Q: Right. 
A: And the only way we did wh at
 we did, we used passive re
sistance all the way through. 
Trying to  surviv e and that was a passive resi
stance. They wanted us
 dead, and we -- we 
by -- and we tried to catch onto a straw, and we 
did, I mean, as long as we could, we did. 
That™s it, right. 
Q: And when your father was working in -- 
somehow in connection 
with this renovation 
of apartments -- 

A: Right. 
Q: -- do you have any id -- you don™t ha
ve no idea how he got this job? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
72
A: Well, I -- I do know. Maybe he got the 
job through his previo
us job, because he 
probably was doing a similar job when he 
was doing payroll a-accounting. I -- I™m just 
speculating on that. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: A-And not only that, he got 
-- he got me a job on that 
construction to work for -- I 
work ed on construction, so I c
ould have some papers. So I would go to wo rk , and I would 
mix cement. 

Q: Really? 

A: Oh yeah. I -- I -- I d id different things. I 
mixed cement. I worked 
in officer™s quarters 
after they did renovation and we had to scru
b the floors and do the windows. And I -- I 
had a teammate with whom I worked, a very
 nice girl. And I -- we were very good 
friends. And -- and th en we heard that -- y-you 
know, I™m skipping in time, but this is her 

story. And her -- and I really liked her, and sh
e has big, brown eyes and -- and two braids, 
brown, th ick braids. And a very fresh fa
ce, sh  -- it was ro sy cheeks. And -- and I 

remember us sitting in this apartment on the 
window sill, a-and a -- and we were talking 
about the -- about the rumo rs of the -- about 
th e rumo rs of the Au gust round-up. And -- 
and I told her that she needs to
 hide. That™s the only way we 
could -- we can survive is by 
hiding. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because our papers were 
not good enough. There was a 
time where he -- or whoever 
was in charge, invalidated all the certificates
. And you had to have 
certificates signed by 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
73
certain agencies like Gestapo, or 
S.S.
, or God knows what else, or special 
Wehrmacht 
di 
-- divisions. I have no -- I don™t rememb er any 
mo re. A-And we didn™t have that, we had 
just, you know, local kind of thing. So, I na
s -- and she ask me, ﬁWhere would I hide?ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁI don™t know, but
 you have to.ﬂ A-And you kn
ow, I didn™t know where I™m 
going to  hide either, I-I had no idea, but it wa
s in my head that unless you hide there™s no 
-- there is n o  saving yourself. That™s it. A
nd that™s what happened . I don™t know wh at 
happened to her.  
Q: You don™t know. 

A: I don™t have no idea what happened to 
her because after the August round-up we -- we 
no lo nger could be where we were, 
and we had to go to the ghetto. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right. 

Q: You™re talking about 
August ™42 round-up, right. 
A: That was August ™42. Until 
then, then my father -- my grandfather went to look for a 
place, and -- 

Q: Right. And he was shot. 
A: -- and -- and he was -- I don™t know wa -- 
no, he wasn™t shot, 
I don™t know what 
happened  to  tho -- you know th
ey -- this was -- this was so
 cunningly devised, because 
they knew that the you
ng people wouldn™t go to look fo
r apartments, they
 had to go to 
work . So  they knew the older people would 
go, so they left -- 
they closed all the 
entrances, wherever 
they were, and that -- and left that 
Peltewna
 Street entrance, and 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
74
they caught everybody one by on
e. And later on the rumors were that -- that th ey shot 
them, that they -- the 
ru mo rs were that they saw naked people on the trucks, and there 
was a bad day, I -- I don™t know wh at it was --
 it was -- I think it was cold -- cold  days, it 
wa -- it -- it could have been either in the fa
ll -- in Novemb er something, Novemb er ™41, 
maybe, or spring ™42. Probably November ™4
1. And -- and so  it was very cold, and -- and 

then they said th
ey gassed them with the carbon monoxide in the trucks, or they  took 
them somewhere where they  shot them on the hills. They used to call na -- 
na  pia ski
. 
Piaski
 mea n ing sands. On the sands, 
na piaski
. They killed them o-on th e sands. And 
voila, and that™s it. And -- and -- and th en 
my father -- grandfather never came back. 
Q: And when did you hear about what peop
le thought happened there, or what people 
saw. 

A: Right after that. 

Q: Right afterwards. 
A: Right after that, rig h t after that
, right, right. Shortly after that. 
Q: So that must have been 
very depressing for the family 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, it -- it was -- you couldn™t e -- the 
problem is you couldn™t even mourn because 
you had to be concerned well -- to do with  
-- you know, with yoursel
f. And this is when 
my  mo ther went -- decided -- we decided th at
 the -- the special pe
rmits allowed you to 
stay in your apartment. So
 my mother went to the 
Stadthauptman™s 
office, the -- right to 
the den of the lion. And wi -- 
she put her nice dress on, dark 
blue with polka dots. I think 
she put a very nice hair from the good old da
ys, and she had the bo
x of chocolates. And 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
75
she offered -- I think my f -- my father gave
 her the instructions
, and she probably knew 
from -- ma ybe he even  got acquainted with th e 
Stadthauptman
, maybe 
Stadthauptman 
would co me and supervise 
the -- you know, a ca -- a -- 
would co me and supervise 
whatever they were doing, 
you know what I mean? And -- 
and so my  mo ther went, and 
she ask for a -- for permit. I don™t know if she 
-- she to -- mu st have talked directly to 
him, whoever he was. There are names for hi
m, but I don™t rememb er what they are. I 
mean, because there were two 
Stadthauptmans
, so I don™t know which one it was. And -
- and he gave her a permit, just like that. 
And the permit was a piece of paper, German, 
that you could put on your 
door, that gave you permissi
on to stay, that nobody has 
business to -- yeah. That they oh
 -- whoever it is that lives in
 the apartment has a right to 
--  
Q: To be there. 

A: To be there. 
Q: And 
Stadthauptman
 means what? 
A: I -- 
Stadthauptman, 
or 
stadt 
means city, and 
hauptman 
means captain. Now, y -- 
captain of the city, you can tr
anslate it. I -- I would say it™s
 equivalency of the mayor, you 
know, but -- but the mayor -- occupational ki
nd of military -- he was in -- he was a 
military person, he was a soldier. 
Q: Right. So was your father liv
ing wh ere he was work ing, and -- 
A: My father would come and go. He would co
me to stay in the house, and sometimes he 
would stay on th e 
construction.  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
76
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And during the ro und-ups, 
he would st -- if he knew about the round-ups, he would 
stay on the construction.  

Q: So your mo ther is getting a permit so 
the two of you are not
 touched, and -- 
A: Well, no, not just two of us, my father, too. 

Q: And so th at is  
A: My father lives in the apartment. He
™s does the -- he did -- didn™t move out. 
Q: Right. 

A: He -- he lives in the apar
tment, sometimes he -- he woul
d stay overnight. You know, it 
was easier for him if it was a -- let™s say if 
he work ed in  a -- in an apartment house, 
maybe he could sleep over there, I don™t kn
ow. I don™t remember that any more, right. 
But -- 

Q: But you™re s -- you™re 
still in the same place? 
A: You sa -- we still in the same p lace. 
An-and we are -- and my mother renewed it 
twice, and the third time she couldn™t renew it.
 But she was so desperate, I -- and that -- 
the -- the secretary told her, there is one way that you could still stay. If it -- if our 
apartment is re -- now, what is it, sequester
ed? Taken over by -- sequestered by the army , 
or the army  or anybody, y-you 
know, of German officialdom. 
Q: Right. 
A: And if somebody™s stationed in ou-our ap ar
tment, we can stay t
oo. And so my  mo ther 
didn™t know what to do, I thin
k she went back to my  father 
to ask what to do, and they  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
77
said they would put some civil civ ilian work
ers. German -- German civilian, but they 
would stip -- still had the uniform, the dark
 blue uniforms. And th ey work ed on the 
railroads. And -- and they took one room, a
nd stayed there maybe couple months because 
it was before the round-up ag ain. And just be
fore the round-up, ma
ybe a week before, I 
don™t know how long before, she said they ha
ve -- they are -- they
™re shipped to the 
eastern front. And that™s -- and th
ey packed  up th e bags and left. 
Q: So th at means you lost the permit. 
A: Yeah, we lost the permit. 

Q: Right. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Let me go back a little bit. 
I-Is it true that in 1941, at 
some point you 
had a tutor? 
A: Yes, that™s right. Oh, that was so wonderful.
 I -- I -- I was very eager to -- to learn, and 
my girlfriend had a -- my girlfriend formers te
acher -- former teacher, was giving lessons, 
and -- but she was in the -- close to the ghetto
, but not in the ghetto proper, just -- I think 
close to the ghetto. And she said she would 
tutor me. And I go, I would go there -- for 

three months I had her. And I -- I loved it, be
cause she was very, very educated, and she 
taught me English, she taught me German 
and she taught me French. Sh e -- she was 
linguist. And I study -- I studied all the three languages. Whatever -- I didn™t learn much, 

but whatever I -- you know, three months, you ca
n -- but I couldn™t pay her, so I didn™t 
pay her, and she taught me anyway, without -- 
you know, this is -- tells you how good the 
people were. You know, she -- 
she said that™s okay, I™ll te
ach you. And then  there was 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
78
another -- there was a -- I th -- another roun
d-up, you know? And I don™t know what we 
did for that round-up, maybe I was -- went to wo
rk, and it -- it -- it -- it didn™t penetrate to 
our area. Don™t forg et we were not in the ghetto
 proper, so -- so we didn™t -- anyway, so -
- so I -- I -- I -- we -- I d -- we couldn™t go an
ywhere, so I didn™t go 
anywhere during that 
time. Eith -- either a -- maybe I didn™t even 
go to work. But it was 
not a long ro und-up, it 
was kind of -- it was a shorter 
round-up. And by the time -- and then  I went there, and my  
mother was so happy, because my
 mother provided me with 
a bag of farina, traded for 
some linen, either napkins, or bookcase -- pillowcases. And I 
went there, and sh e was not 
there any more. She was taken in that -- 

Q: In that round-up? 
A: In that -- that round-up. See, you™re -- 
but I think that she wa
s a heroine of -- of 
resistance, because we were tryi
ng to, in spite of all the te
rrible times we were trying to 
misstate it -- maintain a -- a 
-- a -- a -- a livi -- a -- a -- so me kind of normalcy, so we 
wouldn™t be so desperate. So this is what 
we did now, but then -- and th en they  took her. 
And whoever they took at that ti -- whoeve
r -- yeah -- whomever -- whomev -- whomever 
they took, they -- 
I think by then th
ey transported to 
Belzec
, right, and we know about 
Belzec
. 
Q: Right. So she would have
 been killed immediately. 
A: She would have been -- 
if they took her there, 
she would have been killed 
immediately. 
Q: Right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
79
A: Unless they took her for a 
-- the -- the -- for selection th
ey used to take them to 
J a no wska
 camp, which was a horrid, horrid experience. 
Q: So -- so that was a little de
vastating for you, I guess, right? 
A: I -- I -- yeah, of course, I mean, it wa
s terrible. Was terrible. It still is.  
Q: I can see. 
A: Yeah, it still is, yeah. Yeah, but you know, 
she -- and I -- what is so terrible is I don™t 
remember her name. 

Q: Oh. 

A: I don™t remember even her name. 
Q: Can you see her in your head , what she looked like? 
A: I can™t even see what I er -- I can™t see her. Vaguely outline, no I can™t see her. But I -- 

I just remember how -- how 
generous she was, though. 

Q: Right. 
A: Her spirit of generosity. 
Q: Do you remember
 her apartment? 
A: Well, I -- I -- it was not much of an ap
artment, it probably was a room, yeah, right. 
No, I don™t re -- I remember just
 studying, that™s -- that I c
ould study, yeah. An d I was so 
-- I was really -- that time, and it was at -- 
if you can have a ha
ppy time in the ghetto, 
yeah, you know, th
at was the time. 
Q: But now you weren™t -- were you in  the ghetto wh en 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, when I went to her I 
was in the ghetto
, oh yeah. Right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
80
Q: Oh really, I see, so sh
e was actually in the ghetto. 
A: I think sh e was probably in the ghetto
. You know, I don™t know, the ghetto got 
constantly changed in
 borders, you know? 
Q: Right, right. 

A: You know, they may -- they 
-- they fo -- they would take 
people and then  they would 
make it smaller. And they were changing -- 
you know, we didn™t know wh ich is the 
ghetto. Today you were in the ghe
tto and you bought an apartm
ent, you think th at you™re 
in the ghetto, and the next da
y th e ghetto gets small and you 
have to  move in. And -- and 
you lost the money that you invested in this place. 
Q: Well, you may not remember, b u t if she act
ually was in the ghetto, how would you be 
able to go in and th
en come out again? 
A: Because the ghetto was open -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- at that time. The ghetto
 did not get closed until 19 
-- until September, I don™t know 
which September seven, ™42. 
Q: Uh-huh. And this -- we™re 
still in 1941, 
so she was -- 
A: Yeah, she was probably -- 

Q: -- I see, s -- so when it™s o -- cu -- beca
use I™m not sure that people necessarily 
understand. When  it™s open, wh at doe
s that actually mean, that -- 
A: That mean that you can
 walk in and walk out. 
Q: There are no -- there™s not guards? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
81
A: Well they -- there were also always -- I 
don™t know if there were guards, but you can 
walk in and walk ou
t, right. No guards. 
Q: Without a pass? 
A: Yeah, the guy -- the people can -- you know
, ghetto was al -- always the ga -- the 
ghetto area was always the target of all kinds of activities for the Ge
rmans. Because they 
would go in, they had accumula
ted a Jewish population, and 
they could do what they 
pleased. And -- and do, you know,
 they could take them out 
of their apartments, they 
could capture them on the street. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: They could not do th at in 
the areas that were mixed. 
Q: Right. 
A: Right. So that was a little different. But I 
-- at that time -- you see, when th ere were no 
round-ups, people would try to live normally. 
Q: Right. 
A: They -- they in between
 -- see you could -- yeah, every time you -- they wanted 
contribution, the people said 
okay, we™ll give you the cont
ribution, will you leave us 
alone? The people hoped. We always hoped, 
you hope until the end.
 Even when the b -- 
the bullets raging are aimed at you, you s
till hope that something is going to  happen. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Right, right. 
Q: Okay .

Q: I™m -- I™m temp ted to call you 
Janka
, but -- 
A: Yeah, that™s nice, 
if you want to, that 
-- that sounds good. 
Q: Ho -- how were you eating, what were you eating? 
A: You know wh at? I don™t remember. I don™t 
know wh at we were eating, I don™t know 
how we got our food. I -- but we ate very littl
e, and we were hungry forever. What we 
were doing is sometimes the peasants would 
come to the door, and I guess my  mo ther 
had a -- a treasure of linens and she would bargain 
[indecipherable] 
away for a piece of -
- chunk of cheese, or a chu
nk of bread, or a piece of 
something. And 
so metimes  my  
father would bring something from where he wa
s. And that™s how we lived. We -- or we 
would sell something, but the problem is we
 were not smart enough. I don™t know, my  
father should have been  smart enough, but 
we -- we didn™t -- we should have sold our 
furniture first, but we didn™t do that. Instea
d, we sold everything else. If we had some 
gold that we didn™t give away, then  we sold  
that first. A nd this 
is something you don™t 
sell, this is somethingyou se
w into the lining of your clot
hes, right? But we didn™t do 
that, and -- unfortunately. And our neighbo
r, from across th-the 
-- the neighbor who 
provided me with the 
books, they left their apartmen
t empty, but I don™t know what 
happened to them, rea lly, because when we came back th
ey weren™t there. And I -- you 
know, and we came back to -- 
to our apartment after the ro
und-up of August ™42, they 
weren™t there. And they had a 
little baby, they just -- she -- th
e woman just gave birth to a 
little baby boy who was circumcised in the -- a
nd I was scared stiff because those -- the --

we heard rumo rs about this particular Augu
st round-up, that -- how they -- wh at they 
were doing to little children. So, as I was moun
ting the stairs, and the stairs were rounded 
up to  our apartment, I was lo
oking on the wall to see if 
I -- somebody did so mething, you 
know, to somebody and there would be traces 
of blood, or I-I didn™t even want to look, 
actually, but that™s -- that™s what
 I was fru -- that I was afraid 
that they were taken, I -- I 
don™t know what happened to th em. They might
 have, or they might have escaped. If they 
had means, they could have 
bought a -- some  hiding place 
in some -- some Pole or 
Ukrainian. But they were neve
r guaranteed to last. But -- so
 I don™t know wh at happened  
to them either. 
Q: How about sanitary conditions? Did you have running water in 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yeah, we had the running water. We -- we 
had running water in the place we lived, 
yes. 
Q: You did. 
A: Not co ld and hot, of course
, but running water, yeah. We -- 
Q: Just cold. 
A: Cold water, right. And there was gas, a
nd I reme mb er one time 
I cookedno
odles for 
my father, and I didn™t know ho
w to cook at all, so I -- I le
ft them in the water, and they 
got very soggy. And my  father 
[indecipherable]
 wh ich was nice.  
Q: And did you bring th e food to  
him, at the place of business? 

A: Yeah, I know, he told me -- no, no, no -- 
Q: No  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
85
A: -- that was at home, my mother wasn™t th
ere, I guess. I don™t know wh ere she was, but 
this is one my memory 
with my father, yeah. 
Q: And the toilet is out
side the apartment? 
A: And the toilet 
[indecipherable]
 is on the -- outside the apartment, yes.  
Q: Now, do you think th at you had some conditi
ons that were somewhat better than in the 
ghetto, th at they wouldn™t have 
had running water in the ghetto? 
A: No, in the ghetto -- not necessarily, and 
they would have runni
ng water in the ghetto, 
probably. Some apartments in
 the ghetto were in homes, we
re very deluxe. My mother 
was very unhappy with her apartment before
 the war. She was supposed  to have gotten 
the nice apartment, in the same b u ilding, as 
part of her dowry, sh
e never da -- did, you 
know. And so she was kept wi
 -- up with promises, and 
that never materialized.  
Q: I see, rig h t. 

A: And that was one of the many sour
ces of her, you know, dissatisfaction and 
unhappiness. But she was always a devoted
 daughter, that didn™t ever change.  
Q: Right. And where is your gran dmother? 

A: My grandmother is dead now. Sh
e was an old woman, so she died. 
Q: She died? 

A: In 1970™s. 

Q: No, no, no, no, I don™t m
ean that. I meant now, 1941. 
A: Oh, 1941. 
Q: I 
[indecipherable]
 ask where is she -- where was she -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
86
A: Oh yes, my grandmother, I didn™t know -- 
at that time, what ha
ppened was there was 
one ro und-up, and -- and -- and my  mo ther
 -- I think my  grandmother, I don™t know 
where she was, but she faced -- she was actua
lly caught. I don™t k
now exactly where she 
was caught -- where is she -- was caught near
 our building, but she was caught. And my  
mo ther -- grandmother was a very beautiful wo man, very stately woman, tall and straight 
as a ramrod, she was wonderful. She had a 
wonderful presence. We
r -- her head was up 
and high she had the wh ite hair, and sh e had a beautiful face. And apparently -- and I 

heard that story from my uncle
 recently, when we were in 
Poland
. I -- I didn™t hear -- I 
didn™t know it somehow, I don
™t know how bu -- I didn™t know it, but I didn™t. It 
happened  so that they
 -- she was caught and she was told
 to go into -- mount into the 
truck. And so she asked th-the man if he 
wo uld kindly  help her. And he let her go. 
Q: He let her go? 

A: He let her go. He mu st have been a Ukrain
ian, or -- yeah. And he let her go, right. And 
then, when my aunt heard that
, I think she got my  grandmother out, and took her to where 
she placed my uncle. My uncle 
never wore an armband.  
Q: Now this is the unc -- 
A: And neither did my  aunt. 
Q: Right. 

A: They never wore armb ands. 

Q: And these are the two that had converted? 
A: Yes. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
87
Q: But the Germans didn™t realize, I guess. 
A: Well, there were the German
s, yeah, the Poles didn™t r
ealize it, it™s -- the Germans 
didn™t know who was who. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, they -- unless a Jew  had 
pay e ss
 and a very  prominen t nose, or -- or -- or 
special garb, they wouldn™
t know who were Jewish. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But the other people did. 

Q: So your uncle is out -- 
A: So my  uncle -- my  -- I -- you know, I -- 
my time descriptions, 
I don™t know exactly 
why that happened,
 but my aunt arranged 
for my uncle to work 
in a little God-forsaken 
town that™s not even on
 the map, not a town, a little village.
 And to work as -- either in a 
mill -- I think he worked in 
a mill, as a mi-mill superviso
r. And sh e arrange it through her 
acquaintance with a count who owned the loca
l -- he owned before the war, the local -- 
not the lo cal, but the villages there. They  were
 -- you know, they  were part of his estate. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So, what he owned was that mi ll, befo
re the war, and the brewery, there was a 
brewery. Bu t the Germans let him manage that
. Of course, that wou -- became a part of 
the German occupational forces
, and th ey let him manage it. So he hired my  uncle to 
manage them all. So my 
uncle lived there, and he 
lived in the little village, 
Ponikwa
 it™s 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004

called, and -- and he had the little apartment 
that you obtained from local Protestant, or 
Ukrainian Protestants. Not Protestants,
 it was something else, I don™t rememb er. 
Q: Is it 
Jehovah™s 
Witnesses?  
A: Something like th at. I don™t know if they  were 
Jeho vah™s 
Witnesses, but they might 
have been, right, right. Or maybe not 
Jehovah™s 
Witness, whatever there was at the time, 
I don™t remember. And so he -- and there was a 
hut again. And the hut 
-- some of the huts 
didn™t have real floors, they had clay floors.
 So I™m describing this from the times I ended 
up being there too.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But that time I didn™t even know he was 
there, because you know, we didn™t know 
what the other people were doing.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: We just didn™t know. 
Q: But your aunt brou
ght your grandm
other to the same village? 
A: So my -- ye-yeah. I think my -- we fina
lly sublet-ed, so we must have -- I don™t 
reme mb er how it happened, but she did take he
r, and -- and this count, by the way, even  
transported my  uncle -- I didn™t know -- to 
Ponikwa
 and he transported my  grandmother, 
but not me. We had another trip. My aunt 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: But you didn™t know -- 

A: No, I didn™t know any -- 
Q: -- that they were there? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
89
A: No. 
Q: And -- 
A: No, I didn™t. 
Q: Did yo -- were you all awar
e of where your aunt was in 
Lwów
? 
A: We didn™t know where she lived, no. 

Q: You didn™t? 
A: No, no. She lived  somewhere and no, we 
didn™t know. Maybe my
 mother knew, but I 
didn™t know.  
Q: So you were not seeing eac
h other ee -- wh -- even when 
you were living in the area 
inside? 

A: No, no, no, we -- I don™t kno
w if my  mo ther met my  aunt in between. Maybe she did, 
maybe she didn™t, I don™t know. 

Q: Uh-huh, you don™t know. 
A: Right. 
Q: Do y -- when  you think abou
t this, when the Germans come
 in ™41, through ™41, and 
then ™42, can you feel as if everything is 
getting tighter and more and more difficult, is 
there a -- 

A: Abso lutely, I mean it 
was like a net, you know? 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Like in a net you c-catch fish in a net,
 and you pull the string, and -- and it closes up 
on you, that™s how it was. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
90
Q: Right. What wer -- what were you like?  
A: What I was like? 
Q: You™re a teenager at 
this time, this is -- 
A: Yeah, I don™t know what I was like. I -- I ga
ve examples, so I was like different things 
in different times, I imagine.
 You know, at that time I re
memb er being a teenag er and 
walking in cement, whatever it 
was, i-in the construction pl
ace. And then, after I was -- I 
wash out -- I washed up, a-a-and I put my clot
hes on, a-and my  fo reman looked at me , he 
said, ﬁAre you the same person?ﬂ A-An-And I 
was still a teenager, and then I -- maybe I 
should be ashamed of it, but I rememb er I he
r -- I yearned for a white jacket, because that 
was what the girls were wearing. Can you imag
ine this, in all this 
times? Well anyway, I-
I confess -- 

Q: You mean that the -- you mean th
e Gentile girls were wearing white -- 
A: No, no, even Jewish girls -- 
Q: Even -- everybody? 
A: -- some Jewish girls, too, I -- I -- I -- 

Q: Were wearing white jackets? 
A: -- white jackets, was summertime. That
 was -- must have been summer of ™41
, 
it was 
shortly after they came. So ma
ybe wasn™t that tight yet. So , you know wh at my  mo ther 
did? My  mo ther had a local seamstress, and sh
e took my father™s slacks, my father had a 
beautiful wh ite slacks, and di
dn™t look like he would be 
wearing them again, so my  
mother had them made in to a jacket for me, a
nd I had a white jacket. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
91
Q: That™s very special, huh? 
A: Right. Bu t it -- it™s just tell you that in middle of -- of horro r -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- there are things like that. And I imagine 
if -- I was not the only one things like that 
were happen ing to. Our problems, where we we
re so -- we were deprived, so we had to 
catch onto little things, wi -- do the things
 we could do that were feasible. 
Q: Right. I understand that you liked to sleep a lot. 

A: Right, I d -- han -- yaha -- wa -- I -- you know
, I liked to sleep when  I could sleep, but 
when  we ended up in the real ghetto we co
uldn™t sleep, because sometimes we had to 
move from place to place to place to place, 
and there was no time to sleep. And by then 
we were covered a little with the lice, and I -- you remember my mother de-licing me, if 

you can call it that, rig h t. 

Q: Delous -- you mean, picking -- 
A: Di -- yeah -- I -- yeah, right, delousing, right, I™m sorry. 
Q: How was she doing it? She was picking up the --  

A: Yes, actually, right. 
Q: Did she have lice also? 
A: Probably . 

Q: Did you delouse her? 

A: No. 
Q: No. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
92
A: No. 
Q: Just her ya -- for you, huh? 
A: Yeah, right. I was in 
[indecipherable]
 well, I didn™t do other things either, but I didn™t 
tell you how we went to the ghetto yet, so -- 
Q: No, ar -- no, we™re not even there yet. 

A: We™re not there yet. 
Q: No. 
A: Right. 

Q: No. 
A: Right. So, in due course. 
Q: There™s a period when your -- your mo th er
 and you may also ha -- heard rumors that 
the -- in August of ™42 that there was going
 to be a huge ro und-up, wh ich ended up 
actually being ab out 50,000 Jews, I 
think, that were rounded up. 
A: Well, at that time I give 
you the rumors of that time. 
Q: Mm. 

A: 60,000. 
Q: That was the rumors. 
A: That™s the ghetto rumors, th
at™s what we heard in ghetto, 
after they -- yeah. It™s not the 
numbers that they are quoting now
, but that time it was 60,000. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Whatever is true w e ne -- we never know. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
93
Q: So when your mo ther thought this might happen -- 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- she tried to get you to be hiding with Mrs. 
Kwiatkowska
 -- 
A: All right. 
Q: Is that right? 

A: That -- there are differe
nt things that happened. 
Q: Okay . 

A: First, what the first thing that happened
 was actually, yeah -- 
I don™t know whose idea 
it was, might have been my idea. Cause my 
mother initially was th
inking about the maid. 
She had a maid once, and -- an
d she loved her very mu ch , an
d the maid loved my  mo ther. 
And she was thinking maybe the maid could do 
so mething. But the ma
id, in order to -- 
you know, we had to  have m
oney to pay. You can™t ask anybody take me in and -- and 
not pay. And so I thought maybe Mrs. 
K 
would do th at, and she ha
ppened to  be cler -- 
close by, and th e maid was not. Sh e was -- I don™t know where she was. She was out of 

town, she was not even in the 
city. And -- and we did hear th
e rumors maybe several days 
before. Because number one, they -- they couldn™
t hide it. They invalidated the -- the -- at 
that time ag ain, they invalidated certain passe
s, certain certificates
. And -- and what else 
they did, they surrounded the city. All the ex
its of the city was Ukrainian police, and -- 
and German police, 
maybe even  with 
Wehrmach t
 for what I know, be
cause they need a 
lot of people. So you couldn™t get out of th
e city, there was no way you could get out of 
the city. So I thought maybe I could do -- we 
didn™t know how long it™s going to last, and 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
94
-- you know? So my mother 
had happened  to have 75
 zlotys
. So I said, ﬁMaybe we go to 
Mrs. 
K
, and maybe for a couple days I -- I can stay
 with her.ﬂ And my  mo ther did, a-and 
-- and she said yes. But what happened was 
-- an -- and my mother 
said she™s going to 
hide under the apartment. Ou
r -- not our apartment, but ma
ybe in the basement of our 
build ing. And sh e did, actually, and somebody
 saw her. But I think the person who saw 
her was my milk brother, I don™t kn
ow there is such a definition. 
Q: Milk? 
A: Brother, tha -- this is a -- a literal transla
tio n from Polish, and what
 it means is that his 
mo ther nursed me. She was my  nanny. 
I -- how would you call it in English? 
Q: A wet nurse? 

A: A wet -- no. 

Q: No? 

A: Oh yeah. No, no. Wet nurse? Yeah, well 
-- but what is -- was he to me? He -- 
Q: Now that I don™t know. 

A: Right. Ok ay. So  she saw him, and I guess he
 didn™t turn her in. Excuse me. I™m doing 
it? 
Q: Mm. 
A: All right. So -- 

Q: So Mrs. 
K
 is Mrs. 
Kwiatkowska
, right, who is the mother of
 your very close friend? 
A: Right. 
Q: Yes. Okay, go ahead. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
95
A: And so what happens is th
at she says yes, and my  moth
er gives her all the money she 
has, and she happens to have 75 
zlotys
, 25 per day. And that wa
s adequate. Ye -- Mrs. -- 
her name was 
Janina
 also, she -- she was v -- also very
 poor. She sent her children out 
because she felt they could ea
t better in the countryside, 
and she alone stayed in the 
apartment. So fo r her, the -- the money was go
od, that would give her some food to eat. 
And she fed me very well, I really ate at 
her place, was wonderful. She gave me a 
wonderful soup, and other things, too, I don™t 
even wo -- I rememberthe soup very well. 
But wh at happened is after two days my  mo th
er didn™t come back
. And so she became 
alarmed, because she couldn™t get stuck with a 
Jewish child. I mean, what would she do if 
-- I mean, another arm -- mouth to feed, what
 would sh e do? So she said -- I -- I said, 
ﬁMy mother,ﬂ I told her, ﬁmy mother went -- 
said she™s going to hi
de in her apartment 
build ing, in the baseme nt.ﬂ And so she went
 there to look for he
r, my mother wasn™t 
there. So she -- now -- now she got really sc
ared, what happened? So I said, ﬁYou know, 
the other chance is that he -- she might be in  construction.ﬂ 
Q: Right. 

A: On a construction site, where my father wa
s. And so she went there, and she found my  
mother, and at that time she tran sported me th
ere, not -- not officially, but unofficially. 
We took public transportati
on, minus the armb and, and 
she gave me one of these 
certificates that you saw, I don™t know whic
h one. I don™t know which one actually, was 
first that I got.  

Q: So th at you have papers that woul
d say th at you™re Po
lish, and Catholic? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
96
A: Right. And then -- and the -- and the -- sh
e found me -- we fo
und  my  mo th er, an d  I 
wanted to  give back the papers. And sh e sa
ys, ﬁYou da -- don -- you 
can keep  it. And if 
somebody stops you with them, or discovers yo
u, you say you found 
th em in a book.ﬂ It 
was her words. You know? Sh e was a very kind person. A-And so -- 
Q: Did you look Polish? 

A: Well, a -- 
Q: In some way? 
A: Well, I was blonde. I had straight hair. 
I could -- I could have 
had braids, and I did 
have braids if I wanted to ha
ve braids. And wh at else -- a
nd I had green eyes. So I was -- 
and I spoke Polish too well, as a matte
r of fact, right. So I was a good -- 
Q: You could pass easily. 

A: -- I -- I could pass. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I don™t know if my  mo ther could pass as well. My mother was an auburn -- she wasn™t 
a redhead, but she was 
auburn. She didn™t look particularly Jewish, and her Po lish was 
superb. 
Q: Mm-hm. Well, let me ask you
 something. You said that after you had scarlet fever -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- and you had lo st your hair -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- and it came back -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
97
A: Curly. 
Q: -- curly. Was it now -- 
A: But then -- but th
en straightened up. 
Q: It did straighten out
, so it became more -- 
A: Yeah, right, unfortunately -- 
Q: -- I see. 
A: -- I wanted to have it curly -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- looked very cute. But I have no pictures to
 prove it, because all pictures of that time, 
we destroyed. 

Q: Right, yeah. 

A: Yeah, we destroyed on purpose because we 
didn™t -- I didn™t want to be caught with 
them. 
Q: So now what happens? You 
go -- you™re now with 
your mother and your father in this 
construction -- 
A: Not with my father, 
my father™s on a different -- was a different place. 
Q: So where was she? Where was -- 
where did she find your mother? 
A: She -- she found my mother in the villa
 
of super -- of -- not superintendent, but the 
Stadtha uptman
, the city commandant. 
Q: In his villa? 
A: In his villa. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
98
Q: What was she doing? 
A: She was hiding there. It was unfinished. 
It was under construction, but it was like an 
unfin ished and unfin ished. Nobody wo rked  ther
e. It was left unfinished to -- maybe for 
other teams to come finish it. 

Q: I see. 

A: But nobody was there. My fath
er told her to -- to go there. 
Q: Oh, your father sa
id to go there -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- because he thought it would be safe. 
A: Because he knew. 
Q: I see. 

A: Yeah, right. So th -- here™s this beau
tiful villa, and I don™t know where we sleep, I 
don™t know what we eat. But 
I remembered the orchard. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I sit in the orchard, and I read all day.
 And I look at the beautiful butterflies, and -

- and the flowers, and the ap -- apples. I th
ink I eat the apples that are not yet ripe, 
because -- 

Q: And you™re not a
fraid to be outside? 

A: No, I™m not. I was sitting in the yar -- in
 the orchard. I remember sitting in the 
orchard. 
Q: Do you know how many da
ys you were there? Do you have any recollection? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
99
A: I think there -- the -- the 
Aktion
, or the -- the round-up last
ed for two weeks, but we 
didn™t get there until later, because I was few  da
ys here and there, so we didn™t get there 
until later. So it was maybe 10 days.  
Q: In that place? 

A: In that place. And one time they came, the 
Stadth auptman
 came to look at his villa, 
and we were there. And we were there -- as 
a matter of fact there was no place to hide 
because the closets were open. They were kind
 of closets that were open, they weren™t 
finished yet, so it was like -- like this, you se e? I don™t know if you can see. And we were 

against the wall here. But here, this area wa
s open. They came to the room, and they 
came with dogs, and with child
ren. An -- an -- and I rememb
ered the si -- remembering -- 
I -- I -- I sit -- I talk about it as my  body is 
turning into  a prayer against that wall, and I 
hold my  mo ther™s hand. And th at™s how we st
ood as long as they  were there. But they  
didn™t see us. 
Q: They didn™t see you? 
A: They didn™t see us. 

Q: So they didn™t come 
all the way into the room? 
A: No, they just came in the front do
or, the dogs and all, and nobody -- 
Q: And the dogs didn™t smell you? 

A: No. If they did, they didn™t come to -- or
 maybe the dogs stayed
 outside. I mean, we 
heard the dogs barking, but maybe th
ey didn™t bring them to the house. 
Q: Right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
100
A: Right. And the -- and then they left. 
Q: And then they left. 
A: And they left, right. Yeah, well. Well, that 
wasn™t the end of that either. So -- so we 
stay there, and we stay there. I think so
mebody would come and br
ing us some food, I 
don™t know, maybe my father™s worker -- on e of my father™s workers, but I don™t 
reme mb er that. I -- I™m just speculating somebody had to bring us some food, because -- 
Q: Right, because -- 
A: -- how did we live, right? 

Q: Right, right. 
A: So I think somebody -- and -- and I think so
mebody might have told
 us that this is 
over, and th at we can go home. And -- and then
 we went home. And as we went home, 
we were stopped. And by that time I had my  armb and. I don™t know how it happened  
exactly, but either I took my armband off, or I had it on and my mother covered my arm. 
As -- and we were stopped by certain -- 
by -- later on we found out he was the 
Stadthauptman™s 
driver, who spoke Polish 
too, but he addresse
d us in German, of 
course, because my  mother had her armb an
d. A-And since her armb and was open, and 
mine is covered by her arm, because we are ju
st -- we held on to each other, you know, 
for -- for -- for -- yeah, 
for life, actually. And -- and so 
he -- and he asked me if I was 
Jewish, and I don™t know why, maybe I think be
fore we might have sa
id -- been thinking 
that maybe I should -- I should -- I -- I should 
get papers and go and pretend not to be 
Jewish, and I told him I was not. And then he
 detached me from my mo ther, and he saw 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
101
the arm badge. And he again f -- instead of talk
ing y-y-you know, he started talking to  -- I 
think he started initially speak
ing Polish, and then, when he
 saw that I was Jewish, he 
grabbed me and started to speak German to me. 
Q: And he grabbed 
you by the neck? 
A: Yeah, and he said ha -- he -- and he accus
ed me of lying. Well, I don™t know wh ich 
language any mo re, but he -- they  -- a langu
age that I understood. And, ﬁH -- how dare 
you lying to  me,ﬂ he said. And -- and ag ain,
 he grabbed me by his -- by the thro at, you 
know, just like they 
usually do, right? Anyway -- and I 
-- somehow I lose all my fear. 
And I looked at him, and I said, ﬁYou know, 
look at the -- look at the nature. Look how b 
-- the trees are green, look how the sky is bl
ue. I am 16 years old. I want to live.ﬂ And 
really, I ma -- he must have heard me. 
Q: Cause he took -- 

A: Because he let me -- he let us 
go. He just let us go, that™s it. 
Q: And you -- you weren™t crying. 

A: No, I wasn™t crying. God forbid, I was just
 the opposite. It was lik e I threw the fear 
down  in my  feet. I was comp letely compos
ed. I -- I said it like 
if you know you have a 
play, and you rehearsed for a play. And I mu st
 have rehearsed it sitting in  that garden 
there, and -- and brooding about being 16 ye
ars old and having to die. You know, and I 
told him, and he heard. 

Q: How do you account for that? Since it was 
a frightening time, and certainly that was a 
frightening situation? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
102
A: How do I account fo r that? I don™t know. 
The grace of God, I don™t know. Or -- or 
something, but -- 
Q: Did you shake afterwards? 
A: I did. I think I did, yes, I had a -- I -- I 
-- I was completely drained. I was completely 
spent. Yeah, right. Completely, 
completely spent. But not t
oo lo ng, cause we didn™t have 

time for that. Well, anyway, but he -- he -- he
 heard me, and he let us go, and -- and my  
mo ther was very proud of me because she 
-- you know, I -- I told him the truth, I -- you 
see, I told him re -- no, I was trying to conv
ince him that I would lie, why wouldn™t I lie? 
I want to -- I™m 16 years old, I want to liv
e. Why you -- the lying is not unnatural in 
[indecipherable]
. And he heard it. And it was a beautiful
 day. It was a beautiful day, and 
-- and it was in August, so you can imagine, ye
ah. No, that -- that was the tragedy of it, 
too, right. Because we wanted -- we want
ed the skies to -- to  roar, just like in 
King Lear
, 
the skies were roaring. But no
, not one day of rain, right. Th
at™s how it happened, I na -- 
yeah, and th at™s how they took so many pe
ople. And th en they to ok my  cousin -- my  
cousins, my mother™s first cousin, and her 
husband, and who else 
from my family. And 
that -- yeah, from my immediate 
family, that™s 
who th ey took. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Right. 

Q: We™re going to change the tape. 

A: That™s good. 
End of Tape Five

Beginn ing Tape Six 
Q: Okay . It -- it appears that you™re outside 
living in that place for about a couple of 
weeks, and then you have to go
 to the ghetto? Is that true? 
A: And we have -- first we go to our apartment. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And that™s when we discovered that our
 apartment™s locked 
up, and there are two 
suitcases o u t. 

Q: Two suitcases outside? 

A: Right. And -- and I still wa -- ha -- de -- 
am debating with mysel
f, did my mother pack 
them before we left, or did the people pack
 them who took our apartment. But I don™t 
know. I think my  mo th er mu st have packed  
th em, and they decided in the goodness of 
their hearts to put it out. But 
-- and we -- they could do it, because they have everything 
el -- they had everything else. They had four
 -- two, three bedroom ap -- three up -- no, 
not three bedroom, but three room apartmen
t with all the furnitu
re, with all the -- 
whatever linens that were left
, with everything. Completely 
-- with books, with jewelry, 
some left jewelry th
at my  mo th er h ad . 
Q: And your china? 

A: Well, th -- the -- and the china of course, 
and th e sterling silver, right. Everything was 
left. And my  ga -- and my  aunt was so angry 
that my mother didn™t give her the stand -- 
sterling silver to keep. But my 
mother thought she had the idea
 that she might want to sell 
it. And she didn™t have a chance to, and so 
the sterling silver went to whoever possessed 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
104
our ap artment. The same guy who wanted to 
have it from the beginning. He just was 
biding his time. He knew sooner or later he wo
uld get. But he was the first on the list, so 
he got it. 
Q: And there was a list that th
e -- that the Germans created -- 
A: Well, a -- you know, once there was some
body on the list, and then that was it. I -- 
unless there was somebody w
ho was more entitled. If he™s -- you -- was Ukrainian, the 
only other person might have wanted was the 
German, but the German wouldn™t want it 
because this was not the German area.  

Q: Right. 
A: The German area was separate from all areas,
 and this is -- was an  area where nobody 
could be, and th at™s when the guy caught us. My
 mo ther was trying to  explain to me that 
my  f -- him, that her husband work s there. Bu
t I don™t know what possessed me, I -- I -- I 
did lie to him about something, because
 he ac -- he accused me of lying. 
Q: Right. 

A: Oh, and you asked me h-how come I did that
. I think I did that, now th at I think of it, 
is because I felt that I was falsel
y accused. You know what I mean? 
Q: Of lying? 

A: Of lying. And -- and -- a
nd why wouldn™t -- not
 falsely accused, but I was legitimate 
in lying if I wanted to lie, was perfectly ju
stifiable for me to lie, cause I was protecting 
my  life. And he heard it, and 
he probably ag reed with me. 
Q: Or you so mehow disarmed him, 
and he didn™t kn
ow what to do. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
105
A: I guess. Could be, could be, right. 
Q: So you come to the 
apartment, and there are 
two pieces of luggage -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- sitting there? 

A: Right. So what do we do, we take the lu
ggage down, and I look at
 the walls to see if 
anybody got massacred  in the place. And -- and 
th en we were down, and I -- don™t ask me 
how are we with those suitcases, we end up 
in the ghetto. And by then it™s September, 

and it™s Jewish holiday s, high holidays. And 
-- because they like to
 arrange things to 
celebrate Je wish holidays, and 
that was their way of celebrati
on. So -- so we™re -- but the 
-- we have no place to be, so
 we stay outside. And -- 
Q: You mean in the street of the ghetto? 

A: In there was like a square. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And there™s a bunch of, lot of, hundreds of
 people, we are not the only ones. There are 
hundreds of people there. So we s -- make a c amp around our suit
cases, and that™s where 
we are. And -- and lo  and behold, we meet 
one of my mother™s cousins, but not the 
cousins that I mentioned before. Our family 
had a poorest -- poorer branch  yet. And the 
poorer -- the poor branch of our family was al
so my mother™s first co usins. There were -- 
to start from the beginning, there -- my gran
dmother had two sisters. One sister™s name 
was 
Regina
, and she had those sons, one of whom 
-- she had two sons, one of whom was 
a -- a lawyer, one was a doctor, and two daught
ers. And one of the daughters work ed fo r 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
106
my father. And the other sister, her name was 
Sallah, 
and she had two daughters. One 
daughter™s name was
 Irena -- 
no, sorry, 
Irene. 
Or in Polish 
Eva nna
. And the others -- 
the daughter™s name w as 
Mina
. When the girls were very 
young, her husband, who was a 
teacher, died. And she had -- she was a singl
e mother with two daughters. And the 
mo thers in those days didn™t
 work. So she didn™t work. 
I don™t know how she lived. By  
the time I rememb ered knowing her, her dau
ghter were all -- daughters were already 
grown up. She saw -- she send them to voke -- 
to a vocational school, and th ey became 
accomplished sis -- seamstresses 
and hand-embroiderers, and 
knitters, a-and in order to 
have a -- she send them there in order for them
 to have a vocation, to be able to earn a 
living. And they lived 
with st -- their mother, and she liv
ed in a poor area, and her hou -- 
and she lived in an apartment 
also didn™t have a floor. But I 
used to love to go there 
because they had the wonde
rful handiw -- handworks, and 
I still remember they made 
beautiful little dolls for me. And 
Mina
 was especially talented, and she made a doll 
[indecipherable]
 whose -- sh-she was dressed a la ma -- 
Marie Antoinette,
 in a 
magnificent satin dress. A green satin dress 
with very  -- with nicely fitted bodice, and 
with a beautiful p -- how shall I say, wig, 
perruque, 
and it was just magnificent, and a -- 
I always cherished that. And I -- one day I f -- in -- in 
America
, not long ago, I found 
my self buying a 
Da lton -- Royal Dalton
 girl in a -- in a green dress. 
Q: Really? 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 and I didn™t know how I did it, 
but -- until afterwards, right. And so 
-- and -- and so I used to love to vre -- to go 
there, and they would let me roam in their 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
107
drawers, and I would find treasures there, and 
my  mo ther used to bring so me money, too, 
for her. And -- and one da
y there was happy news, 
Irene 
got married. And she got 
married and she had a boy, and that was be
fore the war. And now, at the war, the boy 
was, I think, seven years old initially, and then  he was older as the time went on. And the 
-- the -- her husband went to war with the Po
les. He went -- he was in Polish army, and 
he never came back. So she never knew wh at ha
ppened to him. And so they were left 
together again. The -- the mother died, I gu
ess, she got older and she died. An d then -- 
now there were two -- two sisters, and we met 
them, with their girlfriend in the -- in the 
ghetto. We met them actually on
 that square. What happened was that the sister-in-law of 
Irena 
was there too. And I even  stole two lima beans from her pot, because the people 
were cooking so up on the, 
you know, little pots. And I was 
so hungry, and I saw those 
two lima beans, and -- you know, before they
 were cooked, I kind of snuck th em out. 
And what happened was -- and I th -- I forever 
re -- I felt guilty abou
t it, because once the 
soup was cooked, sh
e offered to each of us a plate of 
soup, right. And so we lived there, 
on the square, sleeping in a square, until one da
y we slept on our suitcases, and we woke 
up th e next day without them.  

Q: Oh my. So now you 
really have nothing. 
A: Yeah, except one little suitcase. There is 
one little suitcase that™s left. And -- but -- a-
and the good thing is that we found my  cous
ins, and th ere was a wonderful feeling, to -- 
you know, you cannot imagine somebody is a
live. Because when  you so  concerned you 
don™t even  know who™s alive and who™s dead, cause the other people are dying 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
108
elsewhere, and you don™t know wh at happen
ed to them, for a lo
ng time, maybe never. 
You -- you can never find out. We
ll, so here they are. And my
 girlfriend -- and my cousin 
Irene
 has a apartment. And the apartment is in 
the area of the ghetto. So we all go there 
to that apartment. I don™t know, I don™t see my
 father there. He mu st have been  staying 
somewhere else. I -- I don™t see my father ther
e. And as we move into the apartment, a 
very short time after, it™s on the corner of the street, 
Harriman
 and 
Lokietek.
 And it -- it 
faces headquarters, eith er of Jewish Council or
 the Jewish police. And all of a sudden, wi 
-- through the window, facing it, ju
st directly facing it, I see the 
S.S.
 loading some young 
Jews, pushing, and 
hitting, and beating, and -- Jewish
 policemen. A nd especially one. 
And this Jewish policeman look
s like the -- the -- his executioner. He™s al -- also blonde, 
and he looks just like him, except he has a 
Jewish uniform on him. And they  take him 
somewhere, we don™t know wh ere. And th ey -- 
later on, of course, the rumors c-circulate 
very fast. They hang him. At 
that time -- I don™t know how 
true that is, but at that time 
the rumor said that they had 
to hang each other on the balconi
es, which are rear balconies 
of the buildings. And it was just around th
e corner from where we were. And so I -- we 
didn™t see it happen, we didn™t see it happen,
 and my  mother didn™t take me to look 
afterwards, because they  left 
them hanging for a long time. A
nd th ey didn™t all hang them 
on good ropes. They hang them
 on thin ropes, so the ro
pes will break, and the people 
would co me down an d be bloo
dy and made to go again to be rehanged. And there was -- 
and last one of them was Dr. 
Landsberg
, and he was the head of
 the Jewish Council. 
And there™s a controversy about wh at he did or
 didn™t do. But at this moment -- and I™m -

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
109
- I™m quoting the rumors of the gh
etto at that time, that they 
wanted to hang him, and they 
hanged him on a -- on this thin
 rope. So he was one of those who ca -- came down, and 
he claimed the international law that allows
 for mercy if somebody™s rope breaks. But 
they only  laughed at that, and -- and he --I don™t know if he had to  hang himself, or 
somebody hanged him. I don™t know
 if they  hanged him, or if he had to hang himself. 
And tha -- and there were 11 people who died 
that way. And they  were left to hang and 
the -- the mob would come and -- and tease a
nd -- for everybody see, but my mother -- 
that™s why I™m sorry, I sh
ould have gone and seen, too, th
en I would have been  a witness. 
But I was witness of the rest, but not of th
e act itself. But I™m quoting the rumors of the 
time, not -- not whatever was given out. 

Q: So your mo ther went and saw? 

A: I -- she might have, but -- 

Q: But you™re not sure? 
A: I -- I™m not sure, no. 
Q: And you didn™t e -- you didn
™t see them hanging at all? 
A: No, no. 
Q: Okay . 
A: My mother didn™t want me to. 

Q: Right. 

A: Right. 
Q: So, how many of you we
re in this apartment? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
110
A: There were just three of us, that was a 
normal apartment, but we didn™t stay long, 
because the -- the ghetto was made completely small, 
and you had to move on. 
Q: Wait a minute, is -- where is 
Juno
 and his -- his mo ther, the ba -- the boy. 
A: Oh -- oh, she™s -- he™s 
with us. We are together. 
Q: He™s with you? 
A: Now we are t -- all togeth er. 
Q: Right. 
A: There was -- in our party now is 
Mina. 
Now, 
Mina
 has a kidney disease.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And once a week at least, 
my wer-- ts -- he™s not my uncl
e, he™s her first cousin, and 
my mother™s first cousin, and I call him uncle
 because he was my  mo
ther™s age, or even 
older than my mother. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: So he would come, he 
-- and he worked in that 
Janowska
 camp . See, in the beginning 
J a no wska
 camp was not as bad as it turned out to be later. In the beginning people -- 
some people w-went to work  there, and some
 -- they cou -- they have a job, and they 
have certificates, and they can -- a-and they 
can have good -- good ce
rtificates of -- you 
know, that would help 
them live, you know?  
Q: Right. 
A: And my uncle was one of them. And -- but th
en it turned out into 
a terrible thing, but 
he had the right to leave the -- he could le
ave the camp , and he would come to get her, 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
111
and -- wh erever she was, and he would give 
her shots to remove the water, I guess. A-
And -- and he would do it on regular basis. He 
always found us, I don™
t know how, but he 
did. And the ghetto got smaller, so we had to
 go to another, different place. And then -- 
from then on we went to places where -- in 
different places, we -- we were in different 
places all the time, you know?  

Q: So was it every few weeks you have
 to move, or even more often? 
A: I -- yeah, I -- I think -- I 
don™t know exactly. I think there was one place we stayed 
longer. But first we went to a place, and righ
t away they  told us there™s a round-up, going 
to be. And the place had a hiding -- hiding -- 
there was a hiding place, and there™s a ha -- 
the hiding place was again, it was like a false a
ttic, and they would put
 us there, and an 
armo ire, and some kind of pay -- piece of furn
iture in front of it, and a lot of people went 
in there, because it was a -- a pretty big place
. And so my mother went, we all went in 
there. An -- our group, and the little boy, an
d there was a woman with a child, that was 
probably  drugged, because it didn™t cry. 
Bu t so meb ody  mu st h a
ve known ab out the 
hiding place, and there was a man with -- an 
older Jew with a beard, and -- you know. 
And well, it didn™t take long, so mebody knoc
ked on th e door. We -- we were there for 
awhile, for a few hours I think, and as -- and 
then all of a sudden we heard noise, and 
they all -- opened the door, and we were discovered by Jewish police. So they  took th e 

old man first. They took my -- they tried to 
take my mother, but my mother resisted and 
they didn™t take her, they didn™t insist. 
My mother, who had a be
autiful auburn hair 
turned  gray in no time, and so
 she looked older than her ag
e. And th-th -- they kind of 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
112
real -- now they -- they didn™t insist at all, 
and I saw -- I d on™t know if I saw it before or 
after, it had to be after we were discovered 
already. And so they took some people, and 
some people th -- they -- they 
left us, our group, wh-w hole
 group, and maybe even some 
other people, I don™t know who they were. And 
th ey told  us to wait because they didn™t 
have transportation. So we were sitting th
ere waiting, and -- through the window, and it 
was like a -- there was a ki -- must have be
en a nice apartment because it was a large 
window, and it was framing a landscape of snow
 on th e -- on the ground and on the trees. 

And I saw a Jew in a 
ka po ta
, you know, this -- thi -- th is ga
rb, medieval ga
rb, long garb, 
and the 
payess
, and the black hat. And the -- and a policeman roughing him up a little 
and taking him. A-And the -- and there was no 
conviction in what th
e policeman did. He 

didn™t do it, you could see he -- he didn™t 
want to do it. And th ere was no resistance on 
the part of the man. He was -- he was -- I gue
ss reconciled to his fate. And -- and he took 
him. And he took him wherever
 he took him, I didn™t see th
at. And we were waiting for 
long, long time, at least three hours, and I was again doing my  brooding, and that time 

was thinking of French Revolution. And 
I was thinking what it was like for the 

aristocrats. I™m sorry, but th
at™s the truth. I was thinki
ng of French Revolution and 
aristocrats losing 
their heads, and 
place de la Concorde 
and 
place de Liberté
 or 
whatever it was called then, I 
don™t know. And -- and then I 
said, there is a difference. 
And the difference is that befo
re they killed them
, they announced th
eir name, and their 
rank, and their place in life, and everybody kn
ew who they were. And I said, if we die, 
nobody will know our name, th
e time of our death, nobody will know that we lived. So 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
113
not only our -- we -- we will meet death, but 
our life is going to be eliminated, we didn™t 
live. And -- and I said that was a pretty nasty 
[indecipherable]
. I™m sure I se -- I -- I -- I 
shared that with my 
mother, I™m sure. I don™t know what
 she said, she pr
obably thought I 
was crazy. Well, I was crazy, in a way. Anyway
, but then what happ
ened is by the time 
six o™clock came, they came, 
the Jewish policeman came and 
they  said the contingent 
was full.  
Q: So you could go? 
A: So we could go. You know, 
and a -- that™s -- this is the role of p -- Jewish policemen. 
And you know, when they first started, I -- I feel sorry for them. Th -- 
there™s a lot of talk 
about their brutality, but 
I didn™t encounter it.  

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I didn™t encounter it because I know 
that had there been 
no Jewish policeman, 
Ukrainians, or Germans, there would be tran
sportation. They woul
d find ways of taking 
us, no matter what. But because it was Jewish 
policemen, they stopped
. So in a way -- but 
at the same time, you cannot forg et the people who went. 

Q: Right. Cause somebody went. 
A: Somebody went. So mebody went. And that 
was very, very -- that -- then -- then -- 
then it connected with guilt. 
Q: How? 

A: Well, because why me? 
Q: Oh my  -- why you, yeah. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
114
A: Right. And -- and that -- so it -- that -- so 
we wa -- left this place. Again the ghetto was 
made smaller, they took people, so you had to
 move somewhere else. So the next place I 
remember, I don™t know if it wa
s exactly the next place. Bu
t the next place I remember 
was a hot -- in a worse neighborhood of 
Lwów
. That was a hot -- that was really what I 
missed. There was no roads in from the 
[indecipherable]
 there was dirt, and th-the hut 
had I don™t know what kind of roof, no roof, 
was some kind of a -- what kind of roof do 
you use if you don™t use a roof
? I don™t know. A straw roof or something like that? I 

don™t know what it was. And it was a huge room, one room, and several famil -- families 

who are there. So I remember 
Mina
, always in bed because she™s sick. And forever 
making her things, knitting, knitti
ng, knitting. And actually they
 were -- I think they were 
earning our money. I -- they were supporting 
us maybe, in a way. I remember that the 

girlfriend of 
I-Irene™s 
is there, but I don™t remember her name, so that™s why I can™t refer 
to her by name. And -- and I think she™s mad.
 She™s mad because my
 mother doesn ™t let 
me go and -- and get fo od on th e Aryan side, 
because I have Aryan looks, I me an non-
Jewish looks, and why don™t I go and a 
-- why don™t I go and -- and do that? And 
Irene 
explains to her, because 
Irene 
is a very sweet person an d ve
ry understanding, she says, 
ﬁYou know, she wasn™t brough
t up that way,ﬂ she says. So
 you know, I™m an observer 
now, so I™m telling 
you what I observed. 
Q: Right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
115
A: And -- and so  I don™t do anything, I just -- 
I™m a parasite, but not 
for long. My father 
gets me a job, and th is is a gr
eat job. What do I do? I scrub 
the floors again, but I -- I am 
on a not Jewish team, I am on a Gen
tile team, and I get paid money.  
Q: Really? 

A: I get paid money. And I don™t rememb er th
is story very well, but I think that one d -- 
but as long as they don™t kn ow, the -- the Polish women, that
 I get the same  mo ney they  
do, but one day I™m so greedy fo
r the money that I don™t wait, and I take -- I -- I get the 
money th e same time they do. And I think 
that was it, b u t for three months it was 
glorious. Fo r three months, I think, I work ed th
ere. And -- and I -- we ate, we really ate. 
We ate lot of grain, and the grain is not good
 for your stomach, so it caused all kinds of 
problems. But, you know, grai
n is good but not good, yo-
you know what I mean. So -- 
well, anyway, I -- I don™t want to get gory de
tails. So I would go and like th e work  was 

very hard, but I do it, and -- but one time I cat
ch -- I took the money in presence of the 
women, and shortly after I got fired, because I was taking the place of a Gentile woman. 

Q: And they  knew you were Jewish? 

A: Oh, th ey knew I Jewish
, I had an armb and on. 
Q: Uh-huh, you were wearing th e armb and. 

A: Right. So I got fired, and that was the en
d. But befo re that happened, or maybe shortly 
after that happened, there was another ra -- a 
round-up. And here we were in that place, 
with lot of families, an d there™
s not -- and they  had -- they in
vited one of the people in th e 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
116
round-up invited the -- to their shelter. And th
e shelter was built unde
r the road. Oh yeah, 
but to keep the chrono
logy straight, by that time, shortly
 before, my father gets taken. 
Q: Okay . 
A: To the 
Ja no wska  
camp. Before we go into the sh
elter, my father is taken. 
Q: The -- is it the seco nd time that you™re hiding?  

A: Before we ga -- we -- yeah
, the second time we are hiding. 
Q: Right. 

A: My father gets taken to the camp, right. 
And -- and he gets take
n again, going th rough 
the 
Peltewna
 Street, and he had a ba
g of potatoes on his back
. And -- I mean, and they 
take him. And my  uncle -- my  uncle, my  cousin te
lls us that, that he is
 in the camp. But in 
the beginning my father was a magnificent ca
lligrapher, he had a be
autiful handwriting. 
And I still have examples of his handwriting, 
and they all letters, 
it -- it -- it looks like 
the, you know, professional 
calligrapher. And he becomes a 
sign painter in the camp. 
And -- and this is a skilled job, 
so he™s not treated -- but my fa
ther is in his 50™s, and he -- 
and he has arthritis ev erywh -- I mean, by then
 he probably fo rgot about his arthritis, you 
know, somehow. Mind over matt er, whatever it was. So my 
father is in the camp, and 
now they  are -- have the round-
up and we have to go in to a sh
elter. But while he™s in the 
camp, my  mo ther™s managing 
to -- to send him something.  And you can send people 
because there are other people who -- who have exit rights, so they -- the food is being 

brought in -- into the camp. And -- so every 
day wh en we can give him piece of bread -- I 
know how we get it, my -- my 
mo ther gets it. And -- and -- or
 -- or half a -- I remember 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
117
th -- th -- this one I wer -- half a jar of soup
. Small jar lik e that, half of it. A-And s -- and 
so, but we have to go into 
the shelter. And the shelter is 
built underneath, and -- and this 
very tight. And -- and there a place for seven pe
ople, and everybody sits next to the other, 
and there -- the one seat sits on the board  on
 a pail and this is your bathroom. And -- and 
we sit there, I think, for two weeks. 
Q: Two weeks? 
A: Right.  
Q: We™re going to have to chan
ge the tape, so hold th at part of the story and we™ll do that, 
we™ll start right with that. 
End of Tape Six 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
118
Beginn ing Tape Seven 
Q: All right, when we ended the last tape 
you were describing hidi
ng with those seven 
people on those benches. 
A: Right, right. So we had to
 stay there two -- I remember 
two weeks, because it™s for 
two week s that we didn™t send Fath er anythi
ng. An-An -- and I was very concerned about 
this, because I knew that if we don™t send hi
m anything, he may not survive. And -- and 
so -- and I had that dream, in which my
 uncle comes and tells me that Uncle 
Emil
, or 
cousin 
Emil 
will tell me that he™s dead. And -- and so
, after this -- th e -- the -- this round-
up is over, we can come out, I tell that -- when 
it happened, when I drea
m about it, I tell it 
to my mother, and my mother™s
 starting to reassure me it™s
 only a dream. Well, it really 
happened . And not right away, we didn™t know
 right -- right away. And in sequence, I 
reme mb er one mo re hiding place. That hidi
ng place apparently was very safe, because 
nobody bothered us at all. I mean, nobo
dy knocked, no
body denounced
, nobody did 
anything. Bu t then we had to -- again, the ghe
tto was ma de smaller, and we had to go in to 
another apartment. And we did, and ag ain th
ere was a round-up. I don™t know if we had 
time to breathe, altogether. And again the 
people were -- I -- you know, people say that 
the people in the ghetto were terrible, but
 we encountered only go
od will. And -- and we 
were invited to another place to hide, and th
e we -- and it was very, very ingenious. But 
we have to remember that by that time there 
was -- I -- I don™t think there were any p -- p 
-- Jewish police, because as 
they killed the head of the 
Judenrat
, as they killed the head 
of the -- they broke up the po
lice, there was no more Jewi
sh policemen. They -- they 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
119
created 
[indecipherable]
 other bodies, they created some
thing else, but they replaced 
them somehow, but not as po
liceman. And so anyway, so th
is was the p -- this -- why 
was it so ingenious? Because the entrance was 
inside of a armoire, just like a -- you 
know, I don™t know if you remember, there is a tale by -- by 
Lewis
, about some kind of 
fantasy that he wrote, how you enter through 
a -- into a fantasy land through a sleeve in a 
coat. And we entered through a ho
le in the ground in
to the -- into the hol
e in the ground. I 
mean, through the hole into 
the hole in the ground. 
Q: In the hole -- the -- the -- the hole into the armoire -- 

A: The hole was made inside the armoire -- 
Q: -- moire, and -- 
A: -- leading underground. 

Q: Right, uh-huh. 

A: And it covered only  that area, I think, that
 -- of the armoire, more or less. T h ere was 
space for very few people. But we went th
ere, somebody covered the hole with the 
suitcase, I don™t know how many, there mu st
 have been many othe
r shelters, b ecause 
there was space for very few, but we were -- 
my mother and I were 
the two of them. And 
so we went into this space, and -- and shor
tly after, we heard k
nocking. And this time 
there were not Jewish police, there was 
S.S. 
and Gestapo
, 
and they came with sticks, and 
they knocked all over the pla
ce. They knocked in the walls
, they knocked in th e floor. 
But because we were under the armoire, they 
did -- they couldn™t hear the hollow sound, 
and we survived  that, too. And 
so that was a short thing, it di
dn™t last too long, we didn™t 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
120
stay there too long. And we came out, and I re
member that after th is round-up again, the 
ghetto ga -- was made smaller. But because we 
were hiding in  that other place, and this 
place, 
Mina™s
 condition deteriorated. And I don™t thin
k he -- he came -- he came in time, 
cousin 
Emil
, to give her shots. And as we ha
d to move -- we moved into another 
apartment again, and this time it w as a beau
tiful place, a beautiful home. And you could 
see, I -- it almo st looked like somebody just 
left. And -- and th ere were pictures of Swiss 
mountains, with 
prossprip --
 prosperous people modeling 
in  -- in front of beau tiful 
chalets, and -- and all kinds of stuff put 
in a fancy wall, it™s -- with the finest 
[indecipherable]
 but a -- w -- nobody lives there. And -- and so we -- we were not the 
only ones there, and I don™t th
ink we had a bag, because my  mo ther and I, we sat in a 

closet, one next to th e other, with bags agai
nst the wall, and a -- and my mother felt bad 
that we couldn™t go to sleep
. I said, ﬁAs I hold your hand 
I™m okay.ﬂ And -- and we were 
-- and I was sleeping sitting against 
the wall. But when we woke up, 
Mina
 was dead. She 
ha -- she -- they put her 
into a bed, but she was dead. And that was very, very  sad. Again, 
we had to leave there, f -- it was just tempor
ary and we had to move -- move out of that 
place. 
Q: And is the child
 Juno
, and 
Irena
 with you? Or are --  
A: Yeah, we are all together, but different pa
r -- I mean, we were together, was different 
place. And the i -- and the poor 
Juno
, he has distended belly be
cause he™s hungry, we all 
hungry. And -- and then you know, but
 it™s much ter -- more terrible. 
Q: Right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
121
A: And -- and he -- the children are quiet, they
 don™t even, you know
, they -- they just 
take it. And sometimes he would whin e, but yo
u know, it was hopeless, i-
it -- it™s just -- I 
can™t imagine how hard it was on her, on -- caus
e it did -- it mu st have broken her heart. 
It was hard on us too,
 to watch him suffer.  
Q: Right, right. 

A: And -- well anyway, so 
Mina 
died, and we couldn™t even stay there to mourn or 
anything. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And just had to leave her. And -- so we 
made a sarcophagus for her. We laid her on 
the bed, and we gather furniture
 around her, just like a pyramid. 
Q: Really? 
A: And -- and we said 
Kaddish
, my cousin 
Irena
, 
Irene
 said -- said 
Ka dd ish
, and we 
had to leave. And actually, before she died 
she probably  felt that she was dying. A-And 
she said, ﬁI -- I -- I™m the happy one.ﬂ And y-y-y-y-y-y -- 
Irene
 said  that too, and she™s 
the happy one, after she died. 
She -- she™s the happy one. Ri
ght. An-And -- and we left 
her. And just left her as she was. And th
en  -- and that was -- that was abou -- about 
March ™43 by then. And I still didn™t know 
my father is dead at that time. 
Q: And do you think your 
father was arrested in
 ™43, or taken into  
Ja no wska
? 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: In ™43? 
A: Yeah, he was taken when  he was bringing the potatoes for us. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
122
Q: I see, rig h t, okay. 
A: And I felt terrible b ecause I said, what if 
he didn™t bring the potatoes for us, he did it 
for us. And I lived with that for years and ye
ars and years. And -- and I felt guilty for my  
father™s death, until I realized that it wa
sn™t us who killed -- 
who killed him, right? 
Q: Right. Certainly not. 

A: Right. 
Q: So how -- it takes two or three we
eks before you find out, or more? 
A: I think it -- I don™t know how it is, but th-t
his -- first was the once hiding place, then 
the other, and then we had to evacuate. I-It su bs
 -- and then, after I go -- we go to the last 

place that 
Emil
 comes and tells my mother
 about Father™s death. Maybe I was there, too, 
but I don™t remember, and my father died. And 
I was absolutely heartb
roken. And at that 
time we were in a place where there™s no sp
ace to walk. And the beds, they took 
somebody -- again, there were people who 
worked, and there were people who didn™t. 

And allegedly there were two ghettos, ghetto 
A
 and ghetto 
B. 
Ghetto 
A
 were the people 
who worked, ghetto 
B
 were the illegals, who did not 
work . And th  -- you know, if you 
didn™t wo rk, you had to go to 
Ja nowska
 or somewhere. They were
 trying to eliminate the 
ghetto altogether. So -- so we are on that place
, and we are one of the bads, and it™s -- the 
day before, I find out that the fa
ther is dead. And I sit on this 
bed all day and I cry, one of 
the beds. And th e next day at six o™clock th
ey tell us we have to leave because the 
inspection is coming, and we are illegals. So
 my mother packs up 
the little sack , or the 
billo -- suitcase that I have, and -- and -- an
d we go out in the square, not far from where 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
123
they were. And it™s six o™clock in the mo rn
ing and nobody™s there. So we just walk 
around, an d walk around, and we talk and talk 
about what hope there is, what -- and so  on 
and so forth, and how we going to -- to -- to 
-- what™s going to ha
ppen to us. And will we 
live or will we die, I mean -- I -- and I -- I also 
worry that -- I feel that we still have hope, 
because as long as you live, 
th -- until the end, you hope. An
d -- and just as we do that, 
there is a -- we don™t even 
know, but there is a fence on one
 side of the square. And the 
fence is open and the people 
are walking out. And -- and my
 mother puts the suitcase in 
my  hand and say, ﬁYou 
go with them. Go to 
Wanda.
ﬂ And I didn™t have her address, I -- 
I -- I™m a -- my mothe
r, I think before, sometime before, gave me an address. But I never 
tested it, so I didn™t know it for sure. And 
-- and my mother pushes me out. And I said, 
ﬁNow how can I leave you?ﬂ A
nd my  mo ther said, ﬁOh, you™ll take me out,ﬂ she says, 
lightly, you know, yeah
, like if it was -- had nothing, t -- you know, to do th at. And -- and 
he -- she embraces this and she pushes me 
out, because you know, 
the people™s home is 
not very big. And th ese are the people who go 
to work. And before th
ey go to 
work  they  
have to be disinfected, which is
 a horrendous ordeal in -- in 
which they were beaten and -
- and di -- teased, and -- and -- and humiliated te
rribly. Ah -- but I don™t stay with them. I 
drop my  armb and and I™m on the other 
side, and I leave them, I leave the -- 
Q: And nobody catched -- 

A: -- and nobody is there, and 
I don™t know how it was there we
re no ga -- guards in that 
particular place there were no guards. If there 
are guards, I am -- w e don™t even look for 
them, we just -- I do whatever I do without 
-- just look around like this and that™s it. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
124
Q: And you™re still carrying your little suitcase? 
A: And I have my little suitcase, right. And 
like -- I go to look for my aunt. In the 
meantime I™m crying like a baby, w
ith -- you know, I -- because I 
just left my mother. It™s 
lucky for me there are not many s -- pe
ople on street, but all alone and ho -- 
Q: And the day before, you f
ound out about your father? 
A: Right, right, right. Just day before, right
. And -- and I -- so I cry  like a baby and I go 
and I cry, and all of a sudden  I see a soldie
r coming up. And it turns 
out to be an Italian 
soldier. They would ta -- send Italian soldiers
 to the front. And being an Italian soldier 
he™s very full of compassion, so he comes to 
me and he asks me -- I mean in Italian, r-
right, w-which I don™t know. Di -- di -- you kn
ow, but you don™t n-ne
ed to know, because 
body -- it™s body talk, or -- y
eah. Anyway, so he -- he tells 
me -- I mean, he doesn™t tell 
me anything, but he™s signs maybe he could 
help me. And I say oh 
no, no, no, thank you 
very much, and I le -- and I just go. And then
 I realize I better mind my appearance, so I 
stop crying, and I try to
 behave like everybody else. And 
by the time it™s 7:30, I arrive to 
the place where should be my aunt™s apartm
en t. But it isn™t, it doesn™t look th e -- she 
described her apartment to us as a place where 
there is a separate entrance. And this place 
does not have an entran ce, separate entrance. 
So this is a wrong address, and I don™t want 
to knock on the door, so I stand in front fo
r aw hile, and -- and then  all of a sudden the 
people -- there are people all around, so I can™t 
stand too long. And I move on to the next 
place, and the next place looks very much like it 
might be her place, and I take courag e in 
my  hands, and I knock on the door. And sh e 
opens the door, and she almo st faints. A 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
125
whole -- a whole -- blood is drained from her f
ace, she -- i-it -- it™s just unbelievable. I 
mean, it™s hard to describe. And well, but 
she -- I enter, and sh e closes door behind -- 
Q: So is the -- is the -- is 
it fear th at™s coming over her -- 
A: Oh, yes. 
Q: -- or she™s glad to see 
-- she™s not glad to see you? 
A: No. 
Q: No? 
A: No, she™s not. 

Q: No. 
A: What comes to her mind, if I can read he
r mind, is what am I going to  do with her? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Right. Well, of course. And I don™t hold it against her. 

Q: Me -- you were 18 at the time? 
A: Not yet. 
Q: Not yet. Not quite? 

A: Wait a minute, it™s -- it™s 943, but I go -- I™m going to be 18 in October. 
Q: In October. 
A: Right. 

Q: Right. So you™re pretty -- 

A: So I™m still -- 
Q: You™re still 17. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
126
A: I™m still 17. I™m very you
ng, right. That™s important. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Anyway, so -- so my aunt -- and then we
 cannot talk. I cannot talk to her. No w I™m 
comp letely drained, I don™t know what I™m doing
, nothing. I™m just -- 
I™m just in shock, I 
have to say. And so my aunt knows what™s
 going on, so she puts me on her little couch. 
She has a very small place. There is a bed, th
ere is a little couch with
 bookshelves on top. 
There is one space that has a door that lead
s to the apartment ne
xt door, because she 
sublets from somebody. And th ere is a door to
 the outside. I don™t know wh ere she does 
her ablutions, I don™t remember. And so we ca
nnot talk, because she™s not supposed  to 
have anybody th ere.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: She has no guests, and sh e has 
to go to work
. So  she puts a big, big bowl of grits in 
front of me, and I™m in seventh heaven agai
n. So I stay there all day eating grits and 
reading books, in the back, ri
ght. So -- and then she comes back, and th at goes on for 

three days like that. And I don™t talk, and sh
e doesn ™t talk. So it™s -- finally she says, 
ﬁYou know what? I can™t keep you here. I have
 to take you to the ghetto, and then I™ll 
commit suicide.ﬂ And well, I think we did ta
lk somewhat, but not mu ch, only maybe in 
writing. Because she did tall me 
-- tell me how very fearful she is of being discovered. 
How she hears of be -- of wo men being tortur
ed when they are take
n for Jews, even not 
Jewish women. And she tells me what tortures
 are applied. Like ho
t -- hot and -- hot and 
cold, and all kinds of horrible things. I mean
, not all kinds. Hot baths, real boiling water, 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
127
and some other things. Or ice water, somethi
ng like that. And -- and then, I finally think 
of the little paper that 
Pani Janina
 gave to me, and -- and I sh
ow it to her. And when she 
looks at it, she has that glimpse of hope 
in her eyes. And she said, ﬁOh, we can do 
something with that.ﬂ And she 
has those two friends. I -- I -- I™m kind of angry at them 
because I thought they should have been mo
re helpful, but who is to know. I don™t 
remember their names either, any more. 
And those two friends were not Jewish. 
Q: Mm-hm.  
A: And she™s very close with them. I felt 
that maybe they should have given more 
support, or maybe helped her mo re than they 
did, because she was very good to them in 
the times p ast, and wasn™t that -- like it wa
s a new friendship. So  she takes the paper 
[indecipherable]
 to show it to them, and -- and sh e says maybe you can use it, but I tell 
her we can not use it with
out the permission of the lady, of the mother, 
Pani Janina
, we 
cannot do it, because I wouldn
™t want to -- if she wants to do it, she has to do it 
knowingly, not behind their back. So they  
do that, they go to her and they ask her 
permission. And I don™t see them, I™m -- oh ye
ah, I did see them one time, excuse me. 
Q: These two friends? 
A: Right. 
Q: Mm-hm 

A: I -- well, I knew them from before the war, 
as a child. But I didn™t know them -- but I 
didn™t see them since then, an
d -- anyway -- so
 they go to 
Pani Janina
 and they  asked 
her if it™s okay to use her paper, and sh e gi
ves them another paper. I don™t know wh ich 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
128
one is which, I -- one was 
extract 
of birth certificate, and the other is a school certificate 
of -- of her younger chi -- younger daughter. An
d wh at happens is that -- she says yes, on 
the condition th at I would conver
t if I survive. And I say yes. And the two friends come 
in to see if I -- what do I look like, if I can 
take a chance outside. So  they make my  hair 
look like if I am a peasant, 
and -- which I -- I don™t -- I didn™t like my  appearance at all, 
but -- right. And then -- since th
en I gained weight. I was fed on th is grits every day, so I 
-- I got rounded up. I-It took a -- maybe two 
weeks -- a week or two weeks, some like 
that. And a -- but they tell me, but
 she du -- she walks like a Jew. 
Q: What™s that supposed to mean? 
A: Exactly what it does. W-What do you th ink 
Jews looked like when 
they got out of the 
ghetto? Or if they escape from a tr
ain, what did they lo ok like?  
Q: Fearful? 
A: Right. More dead. That was fearful in ever
y pore of their body. In
 their eyes, in their 
hair. That™s how fearful you are. Well, a
nyway, and so  -- well, but this could be 
overcome, so it wasn™t the most terrible thi
ng. And my  aunt decides she™s going to  take 
me to where my grandmot
her is and my  uncle in 
Ponikwa
. But this time the count is not 
going to  driv e us with his car. This time we 
are going to take a train. So we take 
[indecipherable]
 and this is a -- we take the trai
n to -- we have to  take a train to 
Brody
, 
and from 
Bro dy
 we have to go by some
thing, by -- by cart to 
Ponikwa
. And well, the 
suitcase was put over our -- on 
th e shelf above our heads, but
 by the time that they -- we 
arrived, there is no suitcase. So -- and you 
know -- what was -- that was very dangerous, 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
129
because everybody knew that th
e Jews when they 
escaped, they have 
nothing. So if you 
had no clothes, that was one th
ing against you that was very significant. But we couldn™t 
do noth -- anything about it, and th at
 was the truth, they saw it. So -- 
Q: Wh-W h -- where were your papers? 
A: My papers, well wi -- on me. 

Q: On you. 
A: Not in -- God forbid they shoul
d have been  in the suitcases. 
Q: Yeah, right. 
A: Oh my  goodness, that would 
be the end. No, they were on me
. I didn™t even think of it, 
but they  mu st have been, right, cause I have 
them now, right. So , or maybe my  aunt held  
them. I -- I have no idea. That could be -- that 
too. And so we went there, and I lived with 
my  uncle, and -- and they introduce me as my
 -- the niece, the gran ddaughter, everything 
was legitimate. And I lived with them. And I 
went to the woods, looking for partisans, 
looking for mu shrooms and 
looking for partisans. 
Q: The partisans, why are 
you lo oking for partisans? 
A: Well, because I want 
to join them, why not?  
Q: Oh really? 

A: Well, sure. 

Q: Uh-huh. Okay . 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
130
A: Or -- or -- or -- you know, I was looking fo r 
partisans. I went to the wo ods, the wo ods 
were there, a-and yeah . Well, it wasn™t -- it 
was as foolish as -- you know, it was a foolish 
thing, but I -- I really went deep
 into the woods. And -- I wi -- 
Q: But you thought you might 
fight with the partisans? 
A: Yeah, that I might find partisans. But they 
probably were afraid of
 me, and they didn™t 
come out, if they were there. 
Q: They might have thought -- 
A: They probably thought I wa
s a nice little Gentile girl, a
nd they all better stay away. 
They were afraid to be discovered, sure. 
Q: Sure. 
A: And 
-- 
and I don™t know necessarily, maybe ther
e were Jews hiding there too, because 
one day th ere was a big, big 
deshri
, big scream on the streets, they ka -- killed the Jew, 
they killed the Jew, and everybo
dy ran to ki -- to see. The 
-- they -- they killed somebody 
who was probably hiding in  th
e fields. And the Ukrainian 
police with the dogs chased 

him and they killed him, but we never went to
 look. We did -- yeah, we didn™t want to go 
to look because we di
dn™t know what our reaction would 
be if -- what we would say, or 
we would do. 

Q: Are you depressed at this point? 

A: I -- I -- I don™t know if you can be 
depressed, any mo re 
than you would be 
[indecipherable]
. I™m not situationally depressed, I 
don™t know. I may be depressed later. 
I don™t know, I don™t think about that.

131
Q: Well, were you very  sad wh en you we
re alone? Was it very difficult for you? 
A: Oh, you mean when I di 
-- was I depressed when  -- when this happened. I was in 
terrible state, not depression, I was in despai
r, I -- it wasn™t a state of depression, it was 
total despair because my moth
er was in the ghetto and nobo
dy was doing anything to 
help her. And I didn™t see what they could do
 to help her, because 
we had no papers for 
her. 
Q: Right. 
A: So -- an -- and -- and no pape
rs could be had without money. 
Q: Right. So when you 
were in the village -- 
A: So I was in the village there from March, or
 -- or is it April, it™
s a March April kind of 
thing. 

Q: Mm-hm. In ™43. 

A: ™43. And -- and -- and -- and my  mo ther 
-- an-and my mother was in the ghetto, and 
nobody knew wh at™s going to ha
ppen, a-and -- and I didn™t ha
ve to wait long because in 
May they  started it. A-And we -- and ru mo rs sp
read fast. And not only
 that, shortly after 

we had a letter from my aunt™s frie
nds, that she comm
itted suicide. 
Q: That your aunt committed suicide. 

A: Right. And -- and they announced, a-and 
they -- they told us
 about a funeral and 
nobody went to the funeral, because w-we we
re -- I guess my  uncle didn™t want to go to 
the funeral because he was afraid 
to be recognized by somebody.  
Q: And -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
132
A: And nobody went to the funeral. 
Q: And the assumption is th
at she killed herself why? 
A: Well initially I heard from my uncle, he to
ld me she wrote a le
tter. My aunt -- my 
mo ther gro -- wrote to her a very desperate 
letter from the ghetto, apparently you could 
write and be delivered. I mean, the mail coul
d be delivered. And she wrote a desperate 
letter, and my aunt, since my aunt could not 
help her, she killed herself. And then I spoke 
to my  uncle not long ago, I mean, maybe ha
lf a year ago on th e phone, and he told me 
that™s not the reason, that the real reason 
was that somebody stopped her and to ok her 
papers, and told her that they -- h-her papers 
are going to be verifi ed, and they are going 
to come back after to her, to 
-- they going to return. And she 
was afraid that she might be 
tortured, and she might give away  our place 
where we are. In other words, betray us 
under torture. So sh
e took pills. An over
dose, she overdosed.  
Q: Different story, huh? 

A: Yeah, well I -- but it™s very -- 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 yes -- 
A: -- it™s -- well, it was very plausible. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And they  probably both true. 

Q: True. 

A: Right. They™re both true. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
133
A: Maybe he -- at that time he didn™t want to
 scare us, because that was his -- is still 
under the -- it was still under the occupation. 
Q: Right. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: My grandmother, he -- they -- he -- he woul
d have to tell my  gra
ndmother, too, and he 
probably  didn™t want to do that. That was he
r daughter, she lost two daughters, just like 
that. A-A-And -- and shortly afte
r, I had to work in the fields
. It w as an ordinance that 
whoever didn™t wo rk  had to wo rk either in the 
fields or pay some ransom or something. I 
don™t know what happened, but I 
went to work in the fields. 
Either way it was suspicious. 
Q: Right. 

A: If I didn™t work, was suspicious, if I pay th
e rents, was suspicious. So I -- I went, and -
- 
Q: You know, can you hold that thought? Be
cause we have to change the tape, I™m 
afraid. Thank you.

Beginning Tape Eight 
Q: You were explaining that you were susp
icious if you work ed in  the field and got 
money, an d you were suspicious if you didn™t
 work . So  let™s talk about wh at you were 
doing wh en you were 
[indecipherable]
 
A: So we ended up in that we -- we -- I 
guess we discussed it with my  uncle and my  
grandmother, and we decided I sh
ould go and work. And I went
 to  w o rk  and  I w o rk ed  fo r 
a half day. And I don™t know if it was the 
same day or the next day, I was arrested. 
Q: The same -- the first time that you -- 
A: Work ed half a day. 
Q: Really? 
A: Right. I think that I -- had to be the next day. 

Q: Mm-hm 

A: Or maybe it could have been
 the same day. If I worked in
 the morning I could ha -- I 
think I was arrested two o™
clock in the afternoon.  
Q: Huh. 

A: And I was arrested and put 
on a cart -- horse -- horse cart
, right? There was a seat -- 
there was a seat on the cart that was -- I don™t 
know how to describe
 it. How do describe 
a peasant means of transportation? 

Q: A cart with a horse? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: A cart. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
135
A: A horse cart?  
Q: I think it™s cart. I think it™s okay. 
A: It is? Okay. 
Q: Or carriage? It wouldn™t be a carriage. 

A: It wasn™t a carriage, no, no -- 

Q: No, that™s too -- 
A: -- no, oh no, it was too -- that would be too elaborate.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: And so it was a horse cart. And I was 
arrested by two Ukrainian policeman, and -- 
who were rather polite, and -- and he told me
 that I™m being su spected of being Jewish, 
and I™m taken to the 
Brody 
commis -- 
Commissariat 
of Police. 
Q: Now this is the little 
town th at you passed thro
ugh when you first came, 
Brody? 
A: Yeah. Yeah, I think -- yes, 
definitely, it had to be. That 
was the closest town to the 
area. In the midway we are being stopped by 
some other Ukrainian police, and they bring 
a girl, about my  age, dark, curly hair, looks 
like a gypsy. Big, black eyes, very lively, 
making jokes, funny. And they  do the same 
thing with her, ther -- 
she™s being suspected 
of being Jewish, and now th ere ar
e two of us being taken to the 
Brody 
jail. And we get to 
the 
Brody
 jail and they put us in different cell
s -- differen t cells, and I don™t know, I 
reme mb er time with people in th e cell, and I rememb er time without people in the cell. I 

think they put people 
in the cell to find out who I was. 
You know, if I would part with 
some secrets or something. Or ju st to observe. And one time my  uncle came , or -- and I 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
136
spoke to him through th e window, and I was 
trying to convince him that they will not 
deport me, I™m not going to  be deported, but we
 didn™t speak of deportation to -- as a 
Jew. We spoke of deportation 
as a Pole. And -- because the 
jail -- the people with whom 
we were jailed were the people
 who were being readied for a 
departure to amer -- not to 
Germany, 
to forced labor. A-And how it would work
, there were the -- the organizations 
in -- organizations of private people in 
Germany
 who would put an order for fo rced 
labor help . And they  would recruit the people either by doing 
rafles
 on the streets -- 
rafles
 -- no, t -- said -- ch -- is 
-- th at™s a French word, doing 
ra fle
. Well, by closing th e 
street and arresting anybody within. 
Q: An 
aktion
. 
A: No, that wouldn™t be, because that wa
s directed against th
e local population. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
A: Either Poles or -- I don™t kno
w if that time they would ta
ke or ca -- Ukrainians too, 
because Ukrainians were actually their helper
s and they were -- but they -- only in the 
beginning, later on turned to -- 
oth-otherwise. But -- so there were people in that jail who 
were Poles being readied for transportation to 
Germany
.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But to us they sa
id they going to -- th
ey™re waiting for the Gestapo officers who are 
not there, and we are going to
 be interrogated. And we sat 
there for at least a week. And 
after a week they came around, th ey said well, since you say we are 
Lwów
, we are going 
to send you to 
Lwów. 
Let them interrogate you in 
Lwów
, 
Lwów. 
And they -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
137
Q: Now, in the meantime you have your
 papers with you, these papers. 
A: I have my papers, right, 
I showed them the papers. 
Q: Right. 
A: But the -- they never in
terrogated me directly in 
Brody
. They -- I think they did it 
through subterfuge. They put pe
ople in -- in the -- you know, 
in the jail cell to kind of 
figure out who you were.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And apparently they didn™t come to any 
definite -- definitive conclusions, so they 
decided th ey don™t want to both
er with it and they send us 
-- I don™t know what they did -
- thought, but this is what I 
thought that they thought. And 
they send us to -- a-and they 
sen-send us to 
Lwów
. And in 
Lwów
 they send us to a transit 
camp. A transit camp was a 
camp that housed  people that go to 
Germany
 as forced laborers.  
Q: And th-the ghetto 
th -- no longer exists? 
A: That has nothing to do ghet -- 
the lot -- ghetto no longer exists. 
Q: And where did they send you, it -- it™s actu ally in 
Lwów
? 
A: This is in 
Lwów
 and it™s also on the 
Janowska
 street. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But it™s not a concentration camp. 

Q: Right. 

A: It™s a camp, it™s a transit camp. 
Q: I see. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
138
A: In that camp there are barracks, and barr
acks for men I think must be separate, and 
barracks for women. And the women are -- yeah
, and they -- yo -- yo -- and th-they -- and 
women are waiting for determination where th
ey are going to go. So  they bring us 
straight to the commandant of th e camp, 
in other word s to the camp  commanding 
[indecipherable]
 director, whatever you want to ca
ll. And -- and he speaks Polish, and 
there™s one thing that I didn™t tell you, beca
use I forgot, that on the little piece of paper, 
mark in g  my  n ame, th ere is a 
J, 
a big 
J
, in the corner, underlin
ed, it™s like made with a 
black magic marker, and we know
 what it stands for if it™s a 
J
, right? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: For 
J uden. 
Q: Right. 
A: And -- and a -- I think th is paper ha
s a copy attached to it. And my  friend 
Franka  
also 
has one like that. But he doesn™t see us together
 again, he sees us separately. And he tells 
me in Polish, ﬁThey tell me you are a Jewish 
-- you -- you are a Jew.ﬂ And I say to him, 
ﬁAh, they  are just teasing me.ﬂ And he just di
smisses i t, and he said 
to me -- he tells me 
to report to the barracks. So 
I go to  the barrack s and with all the bunch of all the other 
women. And there™s already of 
wh -- and then I found -- I find 
Franka  
there, and we -- 
we sleep on the cots next to each other. An
d there is a rumor already about some girls 
that look Jewish, and the whole barracks ar
e full of rumors that
 those two girls are 
Jewish, but not us. Another -- 
Q: A second pair? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
139
A: Yeah, another pair of girls who ap -- 
wh o apparently are a
ttracting attention to 
themselves by singing. They  ha
ve beautiful voices, and they
 say they are Russians, and 
they are singing. So I -- I mean, I -- I could 
-- didn™t -- I don™t know 
what happened, but I 
know that -- I don™t think th at anything happen
ed on th at parti -- in the place about them, 
except that they were -- I 
knew that they got off in 
Erfurt
 when we went further. 
Q: Now, was
 Franka
 Jewish? 
A: Oh yes. We -- 
Q: Did you know? 

A: Oh, right away. I -- 
Q: You knew it right away? 
A: Oh yeah, we -- you know, we had th-the 
uncanny in stinct to discover one another. We 
did it always, even in 
Stuttgart
 wh en we finally got to  our final destination, we 
discovered our -- identities of other girls in our situation. 
Q: Now on the papers that you had -- 
A: It was that
 J. 
Q: The 
J
 was put on by these Ukrainians? 
A: Yeah, yes, and the -- but the 
J
 was only on the top copy, and on th e bottom copy 
didn™t have it, because it didn™t go th
rough, there was no 
-- anything before. 
Q: I see, rig h t, right. 

A: So I don™t know 
how it happened, but 
Franka
 had the presence of mind, and one 
piece of paper was to be kept in -- in 
Brody
 and the other went with us. So  in her case, 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
140
her piece of paper with the 
J
 stayed in
 Brody,
 and the white one went with her, and with 
me it was just the opposite. 
Q: The opposite. 
A: So, I was very scared that any time now we
 were escorted by -- well, we stay ed in -- i-
in bra -- in the -- in this cam
p for it -- I don™t know if a week
 or two weeks or something 
like that. I think they -- probab
ly  a week. I send th e cards to my  grandmother, to make 
sure they know they are be
ing deported, wh ich was a good 
sign because they wouldn™t 
deport Jewish -- Jewish people to 
Germany
 for labor, because the Jewish people were 
deported for death. So that 
was a good sign for them, so 
they could, you know, could 
protect themselves that way. 
And so what happened was that 
they put us on the train and 
it was a reg u lar train, but we were escorted by soldiers. 

Q: So you were sitting on 
chairs -- on benches. 
A: We were sitting on the benc
hes. And we had access to 
windows, but I was terribly 
depressed, speaking of depression. I was so de
pressed that my  unc -- my  aunt gave me a 

little bottle with cyanide.
 And sh e told me -- 
Q: Your grandmother, or your -- 
A: No, my aunt, 
Wa nd a .
 
Q: 
Wanda
, from a long time ago. 
A: Right. When I was th
ere in her apartment. 
Q: Right.  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
141
A: She gave me a bottle of cyanide. So I don™
t know, I was so -- in such a desp air that I 
decided I sh ould -- I sh
ould do it. And I was throu -- in
 the window, and nobody could -- 
I felt nobody could see me, I took 
it out, and I ga -- put it to -- to my  mouth, and I kind of 
smelled it, and then I threw it. And I was thin
king -- I -- I think I -- I must have made a 
decision that if I did that, that
 would be a self accusation. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And -- and if -- and I wouldn™t jeopardize just me, but I™d jeopard ize everybody who 
was with me. A-And it was stupid. And I still di
d -- I wasn™t dead, after all, and I was still 
going -- I was going to  
Germany
 and why do th at, right? So I made the right decision 
and I threw away the -- the what™s his na
me, the cyanid e. Who knows, might have not 
been good anyway
, because sometimes
 they sold the -- you kn
ow, something that was 
strictly not -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- f-falsified, right? Well anyway, so we 
went on the train, and w-we passed through 
Plaszó w, 
and we saw the people on th e -- in th
e -- in the camp uniforms, in the 
depression and the -- it -- it was very hard to  
watch that, very, very hard. And -- and then 

we were into 
Germany
. We passed 
Erfurt
, we passed
 Trier
, and we still didn™t know 
where we are going, I don™t thin
k we did. And 
we ended up in 
Stuttgart
. And apparently 
what they  did is they sent job orders that
 -- those were specific job orders and they 
already -- and we were
 already assigned in 
Lwó w
 where we were going. So my girlfriend 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
142
ended up as a -- as a helper in a café house
, 
and I was assigned to  be a kitchen maid, and 
a -- and -- a kitchen maid in a restaurant in 
Stuttgart
. 
Q: These are two different places? How -- 
A: Is a -- th ey™re both in 
Stuttgart. 
Q: Right, but -- 

A: But she™s in a different location, and I am  different location. I am in a restaurant, 
which is located in a suburb of 
Stuttgart 
called 
Feuerbach.
 In 
Stuttgart
, 
Feuerbach.
 
And she is somewhere else, I -- I don™t rememb
er where. And -- and our career as forced 
laborers begins in 
Germ any
. And -- so there is a whole -- I 
get to meet my boss, my -- I 
have two bosses, he -- both are single, man a
nd wo man, sister and brother. They own the 
restaurant, and they own -- I don™
t know if they own the buildi
ng, but they  own the first -- 
I think first floor. Their apartment™s on the firstfloor. And this is a -- and a European first 
floor, so here it will be a second floor, because 
the restaurant is on the first floor. I have a 
little -- a little -- I don™t know how to descri
be because it™s so small, a little cubicle on -- 
in the attic up there, all the 
way up on top. But it™s very 
nice, it™s single, and -- and the 
roofs -- the roof was almo st on my head, but 
it has furniture, it has 
nice, white furniture. 
Has a white bed and a white dresser with a mi
rror, can you imagine th
at? Wow. So here I 
have this wh ite dresser and a mirror, and th e dr
esser is so close to the bed that I knocked 
it up right away. I da -- the dresser, I mean. A n
yway, and what do -- th
at was an absolute 
blessing. That fact, that I had it -- a room 
away from everybody, th at was a blessing, 
cause if I w as to work in a factory, I woul
d have to share wu -- probably live in a camp  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
143
kind of situation, in a barracks, or in do
rmitories with a bunch of who knows whom. And 
it was bunch of really dangerous people, be
cause many people wh o went to work in 
Germany
, not Jewish, were people who -- who -- 
I -- I mean, I don™t want to denigrate 
anybody, but people in lower level element. I-I
 won™t say criminals, but -- I wouldn™t go 
that far. But it so happened 
-- but anyway, whoever they were, they will -- they might 
have recognized me. Not becau 
-- because in -- in spite of re -- every sa -- appearances -- 
appearances are g -- are good for a short time,
 but if you live with
 somebody longer you -
- you know the difference. It™s deeper than
 the skin, you know, 
right. So anyway, so 
that™s was my situation, my hour
s were from seven to 10, and -- 
Q: Seven in the morning till 10 at night? 
A: Right. With two hours of 
Zi mmerstunden
, meaning I had two hours break. And that 
was yeah, that break was resp
ected when -- when 
-- before the bombing started. Once the 
bombing started I had to wo rk all the way 
through, and I went -- I went hysterical one 
time, cause I -- I just couldn™t cope. 

Q: With the bombing? 

A: Not with the bomb
ing. With the work. 
Q: With the work? 

A: Well, because I ji -- I -- as I mentioned 
before, I loved my sleep
. And w -- and we had 
to go to a little shelter, and I -- I decided I 
only go to the shelte
r when the bombs are 
coming down. Very often the alar
ms came in, but the -- the plan
es went further to another 
cities. And -- but if the -- the alarm sounds 
you have to go, and I 
decided when I heard 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
144
the bombs coming -- and you can 
hear it because there was a different sound, very, very 
specific, and those were fire bombs, they™re 
in flammato r y  bo mb s. So
 you could -- that -- 
the swish, you could hear that. And so I w
ouldn™t go to th e shelter. So my  boss told me 
you have to go to th e shelter, because they™
ll say that you™re signaling th e -- the -- the 
bombers. So I had to go to the shelter, so
 I barely slept. And my sleep was more 
important for me than anything else
. Well an yway, you know, we keep our 
idiosyncrasies. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right. So  anyway , but in th e -- sometime in between, I developed a very, very  bad 
inflammation. We had to -- when we were 
cooking we had to -- the potatoes were cooked 
on a steam, and th-there was a huge container. An
d usually I didn™t deal with it, because 
it -- it was the boss, who was a ma n th-that did 
it with his sister, who was used to it, but 
one time I had to do it with 
somebody else, and the steam 
burned my hand. I still have a 
scar somew h ere. Right, here is the scar. 
Q: Right. 

A: I had the -- so the -- I got -- I was burned by this steam, and the steam -- an d th-the -- 
the wound did get inflamed to 
such a degree that I had a red -- a red mark in my vein 
going up. And so finally my  boss decided th
at it looks too bad and send me to the 
hospital. And th ey -- and th ey operated immediately. 
Q: Really? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
145
A: Oh yeah. And they put me
 asleep. And wh-what was funny
 to me, I don™t know it has 
any significance at all, they made me count
, and I counted in Fren ch. I don™t know -- I 
don™t know what I could have co unted, and I 
-- I don™t know wh at language I could have 
-- yeah, but I counted  in French . 

Q: Were you speaking fluent German? 

A: By th en I should have. Not when I got there,
 certainly not. But I s -- I went to look for 
books. I went to look for 
culture, which was very hard
, because I was a foreigner, 
Auslündering, 
so when I went to -- to
 the booksto res, they wouldn™t sen -- sell me 
anything. Bu t I think I ended up with a dicti
onary, and I eventually  ended up some books. 
I ended up with first volume of 
Do stoevsky
, ﬁ
Crime and Punishment,ﬂ 
in German, but 
not the second volume. I ended up with anothe
r book which I loved, and a -- but I lend it 
to somebody and they  got bumped, so 
the book, I never got the book back . 
Q: And what was that book? 
A: I-I don™t remember this. 
Q: You don™t know. 

A: But it was a fantasy book and I loved it. 
In German, everything in German, and -- and 
I had a free day on Friday and my
 girlfriend tried to get the same day, and sh-she didn™t 
work hard, because she was very
 pretty so they put on her a black uniform with a frilly 
apron and a little frilly lace hat -- the hat top,
 or something, and -- and sh e didn™t work 
too hard. And -- and wh at she did, among other 
things, she had to paste the -- she had to 
paste the food stamps. And she pasted the food
 stamps -- of course, the food stamps, th-

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
146
they were rationed, the Germans were ratione
d, and it was very hard  to get the meat 
stamps. Anyway , but she -- apparently -- I don™
t know whether she took it as a gift or she 
absconded with it, either, and she came up with 
a sheet of meat stamps. So wow, that was 
so tremendous, we went and bought ourselves 
sausage. And we sat on our -- in my  bed, 
in my little bedroom, and 
we -- and we ate the sausage just like that. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah, it was a special treat. Because we ha
d food th ere, but a -- yo
u know, that wasn™t 
-- the best food wasn ™t -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- right, to be had. But I was never hungry
, I cannot complain. And I wasn™t -- I wasn ™t 
treated badly by my  boss. I had scary mo ment
s all the time because I was afraid that 
somebody™s going to discover my  piece of paper with 
A
 on it, and every time the phone 
rang, the phone rang and my
 heart went into spins. 
Q: You mean with a 
J
 on it. 
A: With a 
J
 on it. 
Q: 
J.
 
A: Because the -- I thought that
 they -- it was taken to the 
Arbeitsant
, which is a work 
office -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- labor office, and that™s -- yeah, and a
ll the way through I -- I was afraid so mebody 
might discover it. But thank God they didn™t. 
I had a scare one day when  my  boss told me 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
147
Herr 
Binder 
is coming, and I had a fit. Cause Herr 
Binder 
is -- was the name of my 
father. It happened to  be another Herr
 Binder
, and this was -- he was the -- he was 
deliverer of the so-soda 
vasser.
 I mean th-the soda, right? 
Q: Soda? 
A: Bi -- bottles of soda. 

Q: Right. 
A: Right, right. 
Q: So what was -- what work 
did you have to do fo r them? 
A: Okay, what work did I do
. In the mo rning I had to co me, and I had to peel the 
potatoes, wh ich wasn ™t bad. And then I had 
to  wash th e dishes. The primary job was for 

me to wash dishes, from -- rest
aurant dishes. You can imagine that. And that was -- there 
was no machines there. So I stood forever, 
washing dishes, right. I-Is that -- I had an 
adventure washing dishes, because there wa
s a patron who saw me washing dishes, I 
guess, because every -- I was here, and here 
the door would open 
and the waitress would 
-- she was graceful waitress, she 
opened -- she had to -- maybe th
ree sets of dishes in her 
-- or four sets of dishes in her arms, and sh
e would open swinging do
or with  her leg, and 
she would march in there. It was a sight to 
see. But every time she 
opened th e door, there 
was the patron sitting by the -- what™s his name
 -- by the door, and -- and I was there, and 
to -- washing dishes. So one 
day somebody send me a rose, 
a beautiful rose, a perfect 

rose. It was fine, I -- I -- an-an-and the 
-- I -- and th e guy who was smiling there, I 
guessed he mu st have been he, so I smiled back
 to him. And lo and behold, a day after or 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
148
so, somebody -- my boss, or my --
 no, the waitress tells me that
 he wants to meet me  after 
work . And I say, ﬁUh-uh, I™m not meeting him.
ﬂ And that went on for a few days. In the 
meantime the rose was getting more beautiful 
in my  room up there, because it was a red 
rose, and the room was white, so in front 
of a mirror was multiplied, it was a beautiful 
rose. Anyway, but I said no, and no, and no
. And then my boss cam
e in and said, ﬁHow 
come you say no? Why don™t you go and meet 
him? He™s a nice guy, he send you the 
rose. Go and meet him.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, I -- I don™t want to meet him. You can tell him, I 
don™t want to meet him.ﬂ And ended there, but 
I didn™t want to meet him because I didn™t 

want to get involved 
into attachments that may lead 
me where I don™t want to go. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right. So that was the end of that. But 
I -- there were -- we met many girls, who were 
as us, on Aryan pape
rs, on non-Jewish pa
pers, and we met 
[indecipherable]
 anyways, all 
over the place, and somehow we felt each othe
r. One time we had a terrible scare. We 
had my  boss, who was very co
nsiderate, apparently, in some ways. He was considerate 
that way, he was considerate. I had to si -- 
wear a sign as a Pole, and he tore it off, he 
said, ﬁIn my house you don™t have to wear
 it.ﬂ So I -- that me
ant that we can go 
anywhere. I mean, we could go to movies. A
nd th e mo vies was a good place to hide, I 
thought. So on the way off, I c
ouldn™t stay home, right? So 
Franka
 and I, we would go to 
the movies. And in the movies one time, so
mebody, as we were walking out, somebody 
knocks and touches our -- on our shoulder an
d say we -- and -- and two girls, and they 

say, ﬁWe know who you are.ﬂ So that was as scary as 
[in d ecipherable],
 I said, ﬁYes, and 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
149
who are we?ﬂ And then we went out, and they  admitted they were Jewish and we are 
Jewish, and -- and like this, yeah right, just 
like that, admi tted immediately. Because you 
know, we needed it. We needed to be wh
o we were. We couldn™t -- we pretend, you 
know? We didn™t want to pretend, we wanted
 feel -- we wanted to be our o -- who we 
were, really. Right, right. So we disco -- I count
ed  17 girls, and I™m sure there were mo re. 
Q: 17? 
A: I discovered 17, yeah, 17 girls. 
Q: And -- and when  you went to the movi
es, did you see newsre
els andpropaganda 
stories? 
A: Probably , probably. I saw the propaganda
 stuff in the papers, terrible propaganda 
stuff, about the 
Warsaw 
ghetto, and terrible things, terrible things. They  showed wo men 
in mink coats entering, stepping over 
cadavers
 on the thing. And y-
you know, we know 
that Jews were not allowed to own furs, so 
how could they wear furs? So, either they 
weren™t Jews, or they were -- I 
don™t know who th ey were, right. 
Q: And the kinds of movies that they show? It was ger -- 
A: And the kinds of movies, they were ve
ry neutral movies, and I think th at new -- 
movies are -- were ma de to kind of lift th
e spirit -- German spirit. So we saw some 
comedies, we saw some -- some
 things I saw even more th
an once. Some were pretty 
good, one had a background of pastoral sy
mphony. It was based on pastoral symphony, 
which was quite good. And the mu sic was good. 
And so -- and so on, and so forth. But in 
-- again, that -- for me that was the escape
, I -- I was -- that was 
an ongoing theme.  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
150
Q: To escape, that™s -- 
A: Right, yeah. To escape fro
m the here and now, right. 
Q: Makes perfect sense. 

A: Right. So that™s how -- and tha -- how it 
went on and on, and it -- what bothered me, 
yeah I did other tricks there. I -- I -- I didn™
t -- I wasn™t good cover up person. My lady 
boss had a very nice voice. 
Q: I™m going to -- 
A: Oh? 

Q: -- hold that thought, because 
we have to change the tape. 
End of Tape Eight 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
151
Beginn ing Tape Nine 
Q: Can you tell us where the res 
-- the name of the restaurant? 
A: I -- I believe that its name is 
N o rdend, N-o-r-d-e-n-d
. And it was located on 
Siemmensstrasse 2. Siemmen -- Siemmen 
Street number two. And it was a corner kind 
of building and had -- it was like a promontory
, and there were streets on each -- either 
side, and the front of is stood -- not exactly in 
front of it, but not far in front of it stood a 
huge shelter, and upright anti-bomb shelter.  
Q: What do you mean upright? 

A: It was tall, with a tower. 
Q: Oh, not underground? 
A: No. 

Q: Oh. 

A: And that™s our -- that was our air raid shelter. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: It had very thick walls.  

Q: I should hope. 
A: Right. And that™s wher
e I was supposed to go -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- every night when it -- 

Q: When they bombed. 
A: Right, right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
152
Q: Did th ey start bombing very quic
kly after you had 
co -- arrived in 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, no, they started ba-bombi
ng in the last year, I think. 
Q: In ™44. 
A: Yeah, but we us
ed to hear the 
V-einz
, or maybe 
V-zwei -- zwei
, you know the -- the 
V-1
 and 
V-2,
 wh atever, I don™t know which one was 
then when  I was there. But we -- 
you could hear it going to 
London
. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yup, yup. And -- and -- and not far from us, 
on the hills, in the vineyards -- there were 
vineyards -- vineyard s around 
Stuttgart
, was a fir -- flag -- 
flag -- you know, antof -- 
anti-aircraft guns, right.  

Q: So you were being prot
ected from the allies, huh? 
A: We were being protected from the allies, ri
ght, I -- and well, actually, I had absolutely 
no fear of the planes. 
Q: None? 
A: None whatsoever. None whatso -- not only 
that, one time I had a bomb in -- in -- in 
my  
mansard
 window, in front of it, it was one of
 those windows that are made in the 
roof, I forget what they are called in English. 

Q: A sun -- a sun -- sun window, I mean a -- 

A: No, no, no, no. 

Q: No. 
A: That™s a window that™s in the roof a
nd has a dormer window, it™s called, I think. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
153
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yeah, 
ma nsa r d
 in -- in French, from th
e name of the architect 
Mansard, 
right. 
Anyway, so there was a bomb sitting there, th
e incendiary bomb. So
 I went down my 
boss and I told him I have an incendiary bomb  
in my -- in my -- in 
front of my  window. 
So he went and -- he -- he we
nt, he pulled th e bi -- bomb out
, and he dropped it, I don™t 
where he dropped it, but it was 
a dud, and nothing happened.  
Q: Fortunately. 

A: Right. 

Q: So how come you weren™t afraid? 
A: I don™t know. 
Q: Were you not afraid to die, or you just weren™t afraid of -- 

A: I was afraid to die by th e hand of the Germ
ans, but I wasn™t afraid to die by the hand 
of allies. I wouldn™t mind if I were, 
it would have been 
okay to, right.  
Q: When  we ended th e last tape, you were begi
nning to talk about on
e of the owners, the 
woman -- 

A: Yes, right. 
Q: -- who had you said, a very nice voice. 
A: Yes, and her favorite aria was ﬁ
Un bel di,ﬂ  
and she sang it in German. And I couldn™t 
help but help ing her with it. And -- and it wa
s very bizarre that th
e peasant girl out of 
God forsaken 
Poland
 can sing -- not sing, but 
is familiar with the 
ﬁUn bel di,ﬂ
 right? So, 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
154
then my cover wasn™t ve
ry good, but by th en they got used
 to me and they needed me so 
it didn™t matter. They didn™t pay attention whatsoever. 
Q: But were you singing in  a 
mezzo
 range, or did -- 
A: I -- I -- no, I wasn™t singing, I was hummi
ng it. I -- I could hum it with her. She was 
singing, I would be humming -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and you know, or maybe while I wa
s scrubbing the floor I was singing ﬁ
Un bel di
,ﬂ 
in German. I mean, you could sing it in any 
key, right? And -- and then not only that, 
what I did, they had a piano, so -- and oh -- 
lo and behold they have a -- had a piano and 
they had 
ﬁLorelei.ﬂ 
And 
ﬁLorelei
ﬂ is the ballad that 
Heine
 wrote to -- I think -- I don™t 
know whose mu sic. I -- I don™t recall whose mu sic, but I don™t think it™s 
Schubert
, it™s 
somebody else™s musi c. 
And -- and of course, 
Heine
 was a Jew. S o  I would go there, and 
I would play 
ﬁLorelei,ﬂ 
and I would sing it. 
Q: So you could play th e pian
o as well, you took lessons? 
A: Oh well, now -- oh, yes. 

Q: But you didn™t 
talk about that 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Well, we didn™t talk about it because I 
was taking piano lessons
 before the war. And 
even in the war -- I forgot about that -- but 
I was taking piano lessons
 until I couldn™t take 
them any more. And I remember my last le
sson with my teacher, and she told sh e was 
preparing me for the recital, 
and I was supposed to play ﬁ
Fleurelise,ﬂ
 and she was very 
tough teacher, she was my mother™s teache
r, and sh e was tough. And -- and -- and she 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
155
finally was pleased with the wa
y I played, and she said, ﬁWell,
 you™re going to play the 
recital.ﬂ And I said, ﬁThis is my last lesson.
ﬂ And that was it. And -- and she knew what I 
was talking about. And that was the end of
 th at. And I never saw her again, and she 
probably  di -- she, of course she didn™t see 
me either. She probably
 thought what -- what 
befell me, befelled all the other people, or th
e other way around, right. It -- what befell 
them befell me, right. So that was the end 
my piano career, right. 
I -- I™m planning to 
resume it after I retire. 
Q: Yes? 

A: Yeah, I have a piano. I bought a piano fo r that purpose. 
Q: Have you played  at all over the years? 
A: No, just -- 

Q: A little bit? 

A: No, just a --  
Q: Scale? 
A: Right. A scale. I didn™t have
 time, I been doing other things. 
Q: Right. Well good, I™d like to hear you. 
A: Well, it will take awhile. 
Q: So you are at this restaurant fo
r what, a year and a half, two years? 
A: I was there until the liberation. 

Q: So you™re there almost two years. 
A: Right, yeah. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
156
Q: It™s a lo ng time. 
A: Almost two years, yeah, right, right. 
A-And -- and th e end was getting very  tough, 
because everybody else got bo
mbed except us. That means th
at we were -- yeah, and I 
saw that happen, because I had this room w
ith the view, and I saw the city burn. I saw 

Stuttgart
 burn. 

Q: But not where you were? 
A: No, no, no, I was on -- on 
the first floor, and watching 
Stuttgart
 burn. Felt very good 
about it, I have to confess. I hope not many
 people were killed, because I don™t wish 
anybody to be killed. I -- I -- I 
hope they were all safe in the 
shelters. But, yeah, right. But 
I didn™t mi nd burning, no. 
Q: Ho -- how was it for you to be with th
ese Germans, who may have been supporting 
the Nazis? 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Oh, they were supporting them. 
Q: They were supporting. 
A: Th-They were supporting -- 
they were -- you know, oh we 
had an incident, let™s say, 
and that time 
Franka
 was with me, I think she was help
ing out because we had so mu ch 
work, so she came to help us out. And th
e window was open and we saw prisoners from 
camps, marching. And 
Franka
, who has a wonderful presence 
of mind, took a pear that 
was there, and threw it out of the window, ri
ght in th e middle. She knew right away wh o 
they were, and -- and -- and of course my bo
ss got very mad, and he said, ﬁThese are 
criminals,ﬂ and closed  the door -- and he cl
osed the window, so we couldn™t do it any 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
157
more. But he said, ﬁYou mustn™t 
help them, they are criminal
s.ﬂ A nd that -- that was the 
incident. 
Q: That was -- mm-hm. 
A: Yeah, so -- right. 

Q: Did they ever talk to you about -- 

A: Never.  
Q: Nothing -- never.  
A: I never talked about anything with them. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: No. Only  things that
 pertained to -- yeah. 
Q: So how tough was this to
 be with these people?  
A: It was very tough. It wasn™t life. For me
 it was like being susp ended in the air. I -- I 
didn™t attach to -- didn™t want to attach to 
anybody cause I was afraid  that I -- I was living 
a lie, and I didn™t want to connect with a
nybody and live the same 
lie. It -- it™s been -- 
speaking of the representative of the other sex, 
an-and that™s why I di
dn™t want to connect 
with anybody, even though I 
knew that many of the Jewish girls had boyfriends, some of 
had -- some of -- the -- to whom they lied, 
and who were anti-Semitic, and they didn™t 
mind it because they were so
 much in love with them
. And I had one who had the 
boyfriend who was a German, and -- right. So I -- 
I -- I didn™t want that, I didn™t want to 
do anything. I didn™t want to comp licat
e my life more than
 it was, anyway.  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
158
Q: Right. And when you got 
together with these woman,
 who -- all of whom knew 
everybody was Jewish -- 
A: Right, right. So -- yeah? 
Q: -- did you talk? 

A: Oh yes, we talked, we did -- we di
d black market with 
them, because since 
Franka
 
had the fr -- the -- the sausage, so we tr
aded the sausage for the -- for clothes. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Because they worked
 in a factory, clothes factory and they -- I don™t know what the 
fabric was, certainly wasn™t wool, was some 
synthetic fabric. And so we got the fabric, 
and some girls worked in the -- as seamstre
sses, sewed us uniforms, kind of, we had 

skirts and tops, so we had the same outfit, sk
irt and a top, in dark blue. That was it. I 
mean, so we did lots of stuff like that. 
But -- yeah. And it was all cover, you know, 
undercover stuff, 
[indecipherable]
 kept in secret. And those girls had very hard  life 
because they were afraid th at somebody will denounce them
. And some girls we thought 
were Jewish, but never admitted to it. And th
en th-there were some men under cover, but 
they would never admit to it. And -- because 
it was very hard to be a man and be in 
Germany
. My -- my husband, though, was. He
 was in -- in forced labor too. 
Q: Really? 

A: Chances are it cost his life, cau se he had 
to  spray th e fields with arsenic. And -- and 
then he en ded up with leukemia, right, right.
 So anyway, so i-it wa
s -- for me it wasn™t 
living, it was being suspended, like suspen ded liv
ing. It was just -- it™s hard to desc -- it™s 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
159
not hard to describe, it was ju
st like I -- I waited -- I waite
d. It was living in waiting 
stance.  
Q: Well let me ask you what may be a strange 
question. To th ink about
 the end of the war 
would mean that you would f
ace a world without 
your mother, without 
your father, with 
so many relatives gone. 
A: Right. 
Q: And yet facing the war -- 
you still face th at, but possibly your own de -- I mean, it 
mu st have been a terrible conflict. 
A: Well, y-you know, 
you don™t think about everything at
 once. You think about things 
that are of immediate concer
n. And my  imme diate concern is that nobody co  -- should 
see my 
W -- 
my ji --
 J 
there, and that was -- I was fearful of that, that was my main 
concern. The other concern later on was that 
I was so overworked that I thought I can™t 

last. And -- but the -- there, every d-day, 
war is coming to an end. And I was very 
depressed all the way through. I was extremel
y depressed all the way through. Oh , and I 
have to tell you that there were some high
lights. I made an acquain tance of a French 
soldier who was a prisoner of war. And I think 
he was -- I -- sometimes I would go out in 
the back of our place, lo and 
behold I saw the soldiers. Oh 
golly, I ca -- I can -- I knew 
right away  he was a French sold ier, cause he 
had a Fren ch uniform. Still, uniform without 
any ep aulets or anything like that. And -- and 
I tried my  French on him, and he tried his 
German. My French was very poor, and his Ge
rman was so accented, we had a very hard 
time communicated. Bu t commu n-municated we did, and was a lot of fun. And then I 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
160
introduced 
Franka
 to him and he fell in love with he
r. So there we were, the three of us, 
right, and that was wonderful because when  the time came to leave 
Stuttgart
 he was very  
helpfu l, and -- 
Q: So how was he a prisoner of war in
 the back of the restaurant? Why -- 
A: Well, because they lived 
in a camp, but they had privileges of walking outside. 
Q: Really? 
A: Oh yeah, well how else
 would I have met him? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Right? I -- I mean, I didn™t question it -- 
Q: Just sal -- right. 
A: -- he was there, that was it. There -- th
ere™s af -- however, however, I found out that 
there were many prisoners of war. All prisoner
s were -- of war were offered freedom if 
they accepted to work
 for the Germans. And 
some officers and aristocrats did just that. 
And then  they went back to 
France
, and they assumed their -- 
Q: Their old -- 

A: Their old whatever that was 
that they were doing before 
the war, right, right. But he 
was not one of them, he was a real sold
ier, and he did not abnegate his loyalty. 
Q: Right. 

A: Right. So anyway, he was a wa -- a very ni
ce guy, and he help ed us get away from a -- 
and a -- ya -- when we were liberated, it wa
s a wonderful mo ment, that was one of the 
happiest moments after the birth of my  
child -- my children, right. It was --  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
161
Q: What was it like? 
A: It was just -- that w as just unbelievable. Fo
r one thing, we left our places of work , and 
Franka ™s 
people, who were very good to her, and 
who apparently appeared to be even 
anti
-Hitler
 ga -- left her in charge of their apar
tment, which was completely empty, to -- 
of furniture, of everything. Bu t th -- they didn
™t want to have it looted, or something, lose 
whatever there was, and -- and th ey g-gave he
r the keys so she coul
d stay there. So we 
stayed there even though -- ther
e mu st have been a bed, I -- I mu st have slept somewhere, 
because the -- I assume
 there was th -- maybe a day or two before the -- th-the 
capitulation of the Germans. And 
so we were there, and we ar
e kind of hovering in the 
basement because we heard a -- a -- shots, and 
ov -- all of a sudden the shots stopped, and 
we kind of picked up, you kn
ow, to look through 
the window. And then
 we saw a helmet, 
and that helmet didn™t look like a German he
lmet. And we looked out, it wasn™t a German 

helmet, it was an American helmet sitting on 
a French, I don™t know, guy. I don™t know 
how we knew what a French gu
y, he mu st have been in unifo rm. He mu st have had a 
French uniform. And that™s how we knew, and 
then we fell into each
 other™s arms and we 
cried. We cried for a long time. We really crie
d, and cried, and cried, yeah. And then the -
- and then we ga -- and -- and then 
Marcel
 came, and he had a bunch of Fr-French guys 
with him and -- 
Q: This is the 
POW
 that you met, yes. 
A: 
Marcel, 
di -- yeah, right. I -- his name was 
Marcel
, he was wonderful. I forget -- I 
don™t rememb er his last name, but I had it so
mewhere at home because he wrote letters to 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
162
me, and he wrote -- he gave me books as 
mementos, it was very nice. And -- and she 
introduced us and I have 
the pictures of the boys. 
Q: These other boys. 
A: These other boys. And th ese other boys we
re members of the resistance and they were 
given the privilege -- they were given 
the privilege to lib
erate -- to enter 
Germany
, and -- 
and -- and they wanted to enter 
Germany
, because 
France
 wanted to enter 
Germany 
to  
have some say after the war. So this was General 
Leclerc™s, 
General 
Leclerc
 regiment, 
and -- and allegedly, I don™t know how true th
at is, there was a rumo
r that they used him 
because he had small tanks, and that was the area of the 
Black Forest, Forêt Noir
, and 
they are going th rough that, and they had to 
have the small tanks. And these guys who are 
resistance fighters, and they want to go to 
Germ any
 to get -- to -- tru e revenge 
Oradour
. 
S o  th eir motto  was, Rememb er 
Oradour
. 
Oradour
 was a city which was burned as a 
reprisal for some resistance d
eed, where all the people were killed, a-a-and it™s -- it™s -- 
and some were bur-burned alive in a church . 
So that was their slogan. But they were 

French so  they weren™t very 
vengeful. I -- I -- they did so
me tricks on the Germans. I -- 
that™s again hearsay, I didn™t see it, but they
 were talking about it. 
What they did, they 
took all clothes there was -- there were in the house, and they poured jelly on it.  

Q: It™s tough to clean. 

A: I guess. 

Q: So how long before you left? 
A: Couple of days. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
163
Q: Couple of days. 
A: Few days. Very few days. Why? Because I di
dn™t know it again, th e -- the allies said 
that they are going to put the -- 
all the foreigners into camps, 
and I had this idea that since 
I was not in a camp all -- all the horrible time,
 there was no need  for me to go in a camp  
after liberation. 
Q: Right. 
A: It made absolutely no se
nse to me. And since we had 
Marcel
, and I want to go to 
Paris, 
and I very much want to go to 
Paris, 
cause I -- I was imbued with all this idea of 
that French culture -- this
 was really typical of 
Poland
, because 
Poland
 had a very -- 
affinity with the French
 because of their aristocracy and because of 
Napoleon
, who was 
promising th em free 
Poland
, and all that jazz, so I -- I 
loved ev erything Fren ch, and so 
we went to 
France, 
but it wasn™t so easy either, nothing is easy. First we hitchhiked, and 
-- and I remember 
M a rcel
 was with us for awhile, and 
we requisitioned a German farm. 
We said that we needed a -- 
Q: A farm? 

A: -- requis -- a far -- not the whole farm, we
 went in and asked -- I -- I™m using the 
wrong word  
[indecipherable]
 my -- you have to forgive my 
English. It™s -- w e went to a 
farmer™s house, and there was a farmer™s wi
fe, and we asked th-the -- sleeping quarters 
for the night, and breakfast. And that™s wh
at we got. We slept on th e floor, we didn™t 
sleep in bed, but was comf
ortable enough. And then  
Marcel 
had to join  his -- he had to 
be repatriated, so he had to 
go on his own, and we went -- 
we went -- we hitchhiked on 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
164
American trucks. There was nothing else that 
was going, so it had to be American trucks. 
And the Americans were very good, and we
 told them we want to go home, or 
something, I don™t know wh at we
 told them. But the -- we didn
™t speak English at all, so 
we couldn™t speak English, so
 they pu -- they took us in
 and we -- and then where w -- 
they got off, we wer -- they ha
d to stop, we got off, and we we
nt in another tr
uck, and th -
- we ended up in a place where 
Marcel
 told us -- I -- I don™t recall exactly, but I now are 

just surmising, we m-met with
 him in a place where was a security  center for the -- and I 
don™t know if it was on the French soil, or 
if it was on an American soil -- I -- not 
American soil, on th e German soil, I don™t reme
mb er that. It mu st ha
ve been on -- on the 
border, or something. Or -- at 
that time there were noborders,
 so it didn™t really matter. 
Because th -- now the f -- 
Germany
 had no more borders. Th
e former borders wouldn™t 
count. So -- so we ended up 
in security place, and I had 
to go through security, and 
Franka
 had to go through security, and 
Marcel
 didn™t have to. But 
Marcel 
concocted a 
story for me which now looking back it seemed 
so foolish and stupid that I can™t even 
imagine. He decided I needed 
to tell them that I lived in 
France
 before the war, in my 
stupid little French, and -- and that I -- and my
 na -- and th -- and ga -- he gave me 
another name to sound more French. I -- I 
was a -- a F rench in a -- from -- of Polish 
origin, and I was deported to 
Germany 
for labor. Well, that opened a can of worms. It 
was a terrib le thing to do. So I was introd
uced to this major, 
French major, and I 
explained to him wh at 
Marcel
 told me to do. And he went to a hell and fu ry. And he 
abused me using the language 
I could not even  translate, so
 I don™t -- not do it. And he 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
165
called me all kinds of terrible names. Allegedl
y, according to him, and I™m not sure it was 
hundred percent true, maybe he just wanted to
 scare me. But he said
 that only volunteers, 
women volunteers went to 
Germany
 for forced labor, and if I were a women volunteer, 
then I -- and he called me whatever it is that
 he called me. A traito
r and some other juicy 
things. And so I, being the little girl, I still wa
s a little -- my mother™s
 little girl, I started 
to cry. And I tried to re -- no, I 
[indecipherable] 
I am -- I am Jewish. Ah, well that was 
another can of worms, you are Jewish. Ok ay, 
let™s see -- look through your things. And 
he tells me, and how come this
 sweater™s new and still has the mark a -- i-i-it -- it™s not -- 
it has a mark of the factory on it? And how
 come -- you are a dirt
y Jew, you probably 
went and robbed the factory, you
 robbed  and plundered. You 
sale juive.
 I -- I don™t think 
it stopped my  tears, right. An -And you know, 
the thing was that in
 order to have the 
sweater, in order to have wh atever I had, my  
rucksack, I traded it, th
e dress that my  aunt 
gave me, because I felt that I didn™t have r
oom for it. And I traded everything I had to 
have this nap -- knapsack and th is sweater, a
nd th ings that I could 
wear and put in the 
knapsack. So I felt that -- and there™s one thin
g I could never stand a
nd I still cannot stand 
is injustice. So I though
t that was the most, the -- the biggest 
injustice that to -- to -- to be 
faced with this bl
oody major, and I fe
lt I was back in 
France 
of -- what was the name of 
the guy who was innocently accu
sed of betrayal? Well, I -- I know his name, but doesn™t 
co me to  me . 

Q: In 
ﬁLes Miserablesﬂ? 
A: No, no, no, no 
Miserables
, that™s a real story. That was a 
[indecipherable]
 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
166
Q: Oh, 
Dreyfus. 
A: 
Dreyfus
, right, and 
[indecipherable]
 
Drey fus
, right. They  accused him of something 
they pin on him and I felt just like 
Dreyfus
. Right, well, you kn
ow, I always make 
connections to the -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- to -- to either history or literature. Anyw
ay, so here I was. A
nd then I had my -- but 
I had my  diary, I kept a diary, I wish I had th
is diary, would have be
en lot of fun. But I 
don™t know what happened to it, I thi
nk became -- it™s -- it got destroyed in 
France
, as a 
matter of fact. I should have taken it with me, 
too bad. Anyway , so -- and they  -- the next 
day, they gave me my -- ev
erything back. They were ve
ry polite, and they gave me 
papers, the papers that you ha -- that I have
 in my catalog of things that still -- th at 
remained. And -- a-and there we -- there was a pass to go to 
France
, to 
Paris, 
and to 
enter 
France 
legally. 
Q: And 
Franka
, how did she get in? 
A: And 
Franka
, since she didn™t speak French, my dear friend 
Marcel 
made her a Dutch 
girl. Now he could have made me  
a Dutch girl too, but he didn™t. 
Q: And why was it okay for a Dutch girl to go to 
Paris
? 
A: Because she was on her way to her countr
y. But as a Jewish girl, I was on -- also on 
my  way somewhere, and I was trying to explain to him, I want to go to 
America
 to ga -- 
join the -- the -- my fathe r™s brothers and sisters. 
Q: Right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
167
A: So that was my -- and they woul
dn™t want strangers to stay in 
France
, they fought it 
tooth and nail.  
Q: Right. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you had a diary that 
you wrote when , during these 
two years at the restaurant? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Really? 
A: It was a very 
[indecipherable]
 diary, but it was a diary, right. 
Q: Huh. 
A: Yeah, it was written in Polish as far as I knew. Right, Polish. 
Q: Yeah, I would imagine. 

A: Right. 

Q: Although that would have been  danger 
-- no, no, th ey knew y
ou were Polish, so -- 
A: Yeah, it was pro -- written -- 
Q: And they couldn™t read it. 

A: -- in Polish and they 
couldn™t read it anyway -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and they were too busy with whatever 
was happening to  them, they wouldn™t -- and 
-- and I -- oh, and I went back to my boss to 
get my  papers, because I had papers, and he 
gave me the papers, and he was furious. He sa
id that the -- the girl
s are -- you see while 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
168
we were working there, I recommended some of
 the Jewish girls for him to help because 
he needed  so
 mu ch  h e lp . 
Q: Right. 
A: All the other restaurants were bombed out. 

Q: Right. 

A: And those girls allegedly 
came and ask him for money, an
d -- and -- and he fi -- yeah, 
and he si -- thought that I set him up. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Right. 
Q: Okay , we have to stop th e tape.

Beginn ing Tape 10 
Q: Okay . 
Janka
, how long -- is it okay if I call you 
Janka
? Yes? 
A: Go -- by all means, if you wish, yes. 
Q: How long were you in 
Paris
 before you left with 
Francesca, 
or 
Franka? 
A: Well, I -- not too long. Y -- we arrived, 
let™s say in May -- oh yes, we arrived exactly 
on May eighth, because this 
was a day of victory -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and we witnessed the day of victory in  
Paris,
 and 
Paris 
was dancing. So  we stayed 
there, we were taken -- first we sp end a -- a couple of days at the Hotel
 Lutetia
, which 
was a hote -- a place where they gathered all 
the refugees coming out of the war zone, 
and they  were giving them medical reviews,
 and then  they was di
sposing wi-with them 
accordingly to their state of health. And since 
our health appeared --
 appeared to them 
adequate, they referred us to
 the Jewish agencies. And th
e Jewish agencies, since we 
were young girls, they were -- we were 
treated as adolescents, and we report to  
something called 
pension en famille, 
but it wasn™t really -- it wa
s a converted synagogue, 
and we -- in 
[indecipherable]
 converted offices in we -- 
that was very -- it was very 
primitive because they were co
nverted offices, and we spend 
there some time. And then 
they made plans for us, as far as o u r futu
re was concerned. I was to -- to become a 
stenodactylo
, meaning I had to -- I was -- since I di
dn™t have a high sc
hool diploma and I 
couldn™t have a high school diploma, I could not
 have the permission to study, so I had to 
learn a vocation, that vocation would have been
 -- that was the easiest thing, since I knew 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
170
a little French, so I would go to the Fren
ch school, and then I would become a 
stenodactylo
. And that was the plan. And 
Franka
 had to  learn Fren ch first, and th en 
decide wh at to do late
r. But in the meantime 
Franka
 came up with the idea that we -- she 
has to look for her family, sh
e cannot start new life without finishing the old one, which 
was -- it kind of made sense. And it made sense 
to me too, except it wa
s so hard to get to 
Paris,
 and to leave it, we would have to do 
some horrendous things. Because there were 
no trains, nothing. The only tr
ains that went back to 
Poland
 were the Russian convoys, 
with the rush  -- Russian nationals, becau
se there was a secret agreement at 
Yalta
 between 
the heads of states, that all 
the western heads of states re
linquish the rights to Russian 
nationals, and will turn them over to the -- to
 the Russian authoritie
s. And that™s what 
they were doing. And I witnessed them doi
ng that in the movie 
theaters, where they 
would stand by the door, and 
watch for the patrons to leave, and they would round up 
whomever -- whoever they thought were a na
sh -- a Russian national, which wasn™t too 
hard to detect. And th e only way we could do 
that -- and then they 
would put them in a 
special camp that was organized in a place called 
Beauregard, 
near 
Paris
, and once you 
entered this it was Russian territory, it was 
just like entering a ma
 -- a Russian embassy, 
and there you were in a Russian soil, 
that was it. So the only way to ma -- 
Franka
 had 
some Russian friends, so she found that out. She spoke Russian, her family was of 

Russian orig in. And she spoke Russian very 
well, I -- I just had little Russian. And she 
decided that we can enter that camp, and -- a
nd then they will trans
port us east. I don™t 
know, we didn™t have it -- the idea that we mi ght go to  
Lwó w, 
but I -- I -- I don™t think ba 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
171
-- well, anyway, by the time when we le -- 
we went to that ca
mp, that was a very 
primitive camp, with barracks, and there were a 
lot of people, and they all under lock and 
key, of course. That was a locked up camp wi
th, I think, guard s all over the place. And I 
think we spend some time there, maybe week
, maybe more, maybe less. And we left in 
July, I think, or maybe late June, I don™t know
. I can look at the dates in the papers. And -
- and we left on a transport, and it was -- i-it
 was not a regular train, it was a train tha -- 
for deportees, so it was not a -- it was freight tr
ain, in -- in other word
s. And I think we sl-
slept on the gr -- on the -- on something made fro
m straw kind of things, inside the train. 
And the train would stop very of
ten because to let go other tr
ains that had priority. And 
one such train was a prison train, with -- guarde
d by so ldiers, with -- 
with bars in the little 
windows, and right away the 
rumors spread that this tr
ain was a prison train for the 
followers of General 
Vlasov
, and General 
Vlasov
 was a -- a traitor to the war effort 
because he -- even thou
gh he was originally 
a very heroic general, he surrendered to 
Germans and he promised them to fight on th
eir side, along -- and he recruited lot of 
former prisoners of war, maybe mostly Uk ra
inians. And they fought -- I don™t if they 
fought it, maybe -- I don™t know if Germans really
 trusted them to fight or not. But, a-at 
the end of the war, they were 
considered the biggest traitors
 ever, both to th e Ru ssians, 
and to Americans, because they
 were fighting on the side of 
Germany
. But General 
Vlasov
 was thinking in terms of saving his skin
, and so he pushed to be on the -- under 
the western side -- western sphere of infl
uence. So, he surrendered, somewhere in 
Czechoslovakia, 
or maybe not in 
Czechoslovakia
, I think near 
Czechoslovakia
, to the 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
172
American forces, with his whole army. And 
he was taken prisoner, but he didn™t know 
about that arrangement of yal -- at 
Yalta
, and he was immediately turned  over -- I don™t 
know if -- how immediately, but very soon turn
ed over to the Soviet authorities, and he 
was sent to 
Russia
 and shot. And I -- I don™t know if 
he was tried or not, if he -- you 
know, I don™t know. They -- 
they did show trials in 
Soviet Union. 
But the soldiers, the 
soldiers we saw there, and the so ldiers 
were making jokes with us, who would -- you 
know, we surrounded, surrounded the train ri
ght away , and th ere were young faces in 
these barred windows, and they  were smili
ng and laughing. A-And -- and we all knew 
they were going to their death. And I didn
™t know, you know, we 
knew they were going 
to their death, but what kind 
of death they met, I didn™t know then, until now I saw it on 
the internet. And it -- there is a -- and there 
is a -- a report of somebody who witn essed, 
an engineer, American 
engineer in the army  who witne
ssed their surrender, and he relates 
that they were shot immediately after they di
semb arked in -- on th e -- out of the trains in 
Russia
. They were sho -- o-on -- on arrival. They
 were shot on arrival. A-And we met 
that -- we met them o n  the way. And we had 
to wait because their train had the priority. 
Q: So, in  your going back to 
Poland
, you were going to go with 
Franka
, you were not 
going to  go to find your own family. 

A: Well, I sure did if I could find them, 
because my uncle -- my uncle worked in 
Rzeszó w
 b efore the war, that was the little
 town. So I thought I™ll got to 
Rzeszów
, and 
maybe he was there, maybe he ca
me back and I could find him in 
Rzeszó w
 b ecause 
that™s where his job was.  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
173
Q: Right. 
A: And nobody knew there he was a Jew there, 
because he worked ther
e as a Pole, so he 
could go there. 

Q: Right. 

A: So, I -- I-I -- I ha -- I -- I think we got off in 
Kraków
, and we got the permit. As 
refugees they would give us a per -- we got
 -- we escaped from the train, it wasn™t so 
easy, we -- we brood about it, 
and thought about it, and -- 
and we got off the train by 
subterfuge, telling we wanted water, or some th
ing, or food. And we
 never got back on, 
and our papers went with the train, the main
 papers that we had. And our name went -- 
yeah, they went to 
Russia. 
So -- but we had some other pape
rs still left, so we used them. 
And I think we did anyway. I -- you know, I d
on™t remember what I had or I didn™t have, 

I certainly acquire a lot -- acquired -- upon arri
val, we acquired a lot of papers. So -- and I 
know that if we went to 
Poland
, we went under name of 
Franka
 and 
Helena
, o r  
Helene
, 
because that -- otherwise would have been fo
olish. So -- so a-an 
-- so we got off at 
Kraków
, we got a pass to 
Rzeszó w
, we got off in 
Rzeszów. 
When we got off -- I mean, 
we escaped from the train in 
Kraków
, and we got a permit -- free train ride to 
Rzeszó w
, 
o-on the base that we were refugees l
ooking for family, which was true. We got to 
Rzeszó w
, and we walked in the 
situation after a pogrom
. 
And because there was a 
pogrom in there -- 
Rzeszó w
 couple days before, and we lear
ned that, and the streets were 
kind of empty, we didn™t know wh at to do
, but we came across a person, we decided he 
mu st be Jewish. So  we stopped him, a-and he 
turned -- it turned out right, and right away  

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
174
he took us to the place, to 
a Jewish community, an
d they said people
 are in hiding now 
because we have the situation, and later on I found out that some pe
ople were even killed, 
but at that time he didn™t tell us th at. But 
I found out from other people who were there, 
and you know, and that™s why 
I knew about the -- I mean, 
from another point of view. 
But in the meantime h e -- he told
 us that -- well, i-if we want
 to get out, we should get out 
as soon as possible. I don™t know if it wa
s he who told  us that the borders to 
Czechoslovakia
, we have to get out fro
m Czechoslova -- through 
Czechoslovakia,
 migh t 
be closed, and he send us to 
Kraków, 
back to 
Kraków, 
and he gave us 
money, and he 
prepared our -- I-I don™t know if we got a train 
pass, or we paid for the train, whatever it 
was. They ro -- and they recei
ved us just like we were thei
r brothers, or their family; 
very, very  well. And they put us 
on th e train, and we ended up in  
Kraków
, only this time 
to stay, not to leave. And th
e first thing we did, we we
nt to the Jewish Community 
Center, and we started looking for people wh
o registered there, because whoever came, 
registered there. And he told us 
that, he told us go to -- go to [
indecipherable
] t o  
examine the registry of survivors. And 
lo and behold I found my girlfriend from 
Lwów
. 
The girl, with whom I went to
 school, the high school, was 
my  best friend in high school. 
So of course I located her, and 
I told her our situation, w -- 
she -- sh e told me her story. 
She had a tragic story too, convoluted trag
ic story. Her fa -- her brother went to -- 
volunteered to fight for -- in 
Warsaw
 ghetto -- not 
Wa rsa w
 ghetto, the Polish 
Warsaw
 
uprising, and he -- he fo ught as a Pole, an
d he was taken prisone
r and he died in 
somewhere, of his wounds. And so she was 
now alone, and -- and her parents got killed 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
175
in the round-ups of 
Lwó w
, and she says she wants to go w
ith us. So there were three of 
us now. So -- but she kn
ew a lot of people in 
Kraków
, so she arranged for passes to 
Czechoslovakia
. The reason we went to 
Czechoslova --
 we were going to 
Czechoslovakia
 is to -- to go to the 
French  embassy. And the fren -- the closest was in 
Prague
, so we went to 
Prague
. So we -- so she secured the 
-- she helped us secure the 
passes, and that time was still passes and the wo
nder was, that was one of the last passes 
every issued at that time. Later o n  the bo
rders were closed, ther
e were no passes, and 
whoever wanted to get out 
had to do it illegally. So th
e people were crossing to 
Germany
 
instead of 
Prague. 
And we went -- I think we went thro ugh 
Ka towice
, because I have a 
pass to 
Kato wice
. So he -- we went through 
Ka to wice
 to 
Prague
. Of course 
Prague
 is 
the mo -- one of the most beautiful cities of 
Europe
, and we were there for three days 
and I™m s -- kind of speeding it up, so we 
did see some places and things. Bu t wh en we 
went to the French embassy we presented 
our case, and -- and -- and without any ado, 
they granted the per -- as the 
[indecipherable]
. We told them that we -- we were in 
France
 and we came back to look 
for the family, and we didn
™t find anybody. So since 
we didn™t find any -- in 
Rzeszó w
 I didn™t find anybody, my be
 -- my uncle wasn™t there. 
And I checked with -- they had registry there t
oo, the local registry and he wasn™t there. 
And -- and so I went -- so we told him the trut
h, and he said yes of course, and he said 
com -- that there™s a plane 
tomorrow that leaves for 
Paris
. Be on it. And -- 
Q: And so you went? 
A: On a plane, on a milita
ry plane, repatriated to 
Paris,
 right.

Q: And where did you go when  you were in 
Paris
? Did you all three stick together? 
A: Oh yes, absolutely, and th
e thing is that we didn™t co
me in under our own name. All 
our papers were issued in -- in the fa -- 
under false name s. So I -- I was very lucky, 
sometime after, but not right aw
ay after, maybe months after, 
I got to talk to a very -- 
very thoughtful and helpful so
cial worker, and I told her that I -- here I have my real 
name, but I live under this false n ame, and -- 
and she said, ﬁBut you can change it, I can 
arrange it for you.ﬂ And sh e did, without an
y pro -- I don™t know how she did it, but she 
did it, and I got my  own name back . Bu t 
Franka  
stayed on her other name. 
Q: She did? 
A: Yeah. And -- and my girlfriend, who escaped from a 
Belzec
 train -- 
Q: Oh my. 
A: -- you heard that girl -- my girl
friend from high school, her name was 
Mary la
. She -- 
she yeah, she had horren
dous stories to tell. And she esca
ped from the train, yeah, right. 
And she was with us, and we shared for awh
ile, we -- now they treated us as adults, no 
more children, and they put us first on the d -- 
Ambrose Thomas
 for a short time, and 
then they transferred us to -- to 
Guy Patin
. And then the -- we start a new life again. 
Q: And is -- is that where you were interviewed by
 David Bo der? 
A: Yes, uh-huh. 

Q: Let me -- I just want to play the first minute of the tape. 

A: By all means. 
Q: Have you -- have 
you heard your tape? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
177
A: Oh yes. 
Q: You have heard the tape. 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I have a very nice voice on th at tape. 

Q: Yes, you do. 
A: Very nice, girlish voice.  
Q: Let™s se e if we 
can -- I can just --  
[plays excerpt from audiotape] 
Q: We won™t go through your story 
[indecipherable]
 
A: That™s good. But you -- the quality of your
 tape is mu ch better than any of mine. The 
one I have is terrible. 

Q: Well then, we™ll provide you with -- 
A: Yeah, that would be nice. 
Q: -- a good -- a good quality tape. 

A: And if you could send me a good 
co py, too, that wo uld be good. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, sure. 

A: A -- a written copy. 

Q: Of the transcript?  

A: Yeah, right. 
Q: Sure, sure. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
178
A: Because mine is very -- 
Q: Abso lutely. 
A: -- all over the place. 
Q: So how is it that you came to 
be interviewed by this man? 
A: Well, I think he needed for 
-- h-he wanted  to interview survivors, and wh ere is a better 
place than in a survivor home 
[indecipherable]
 of the local agency
, right? So he found 
th-there ma ny candidates. I don™t know how ma
ny people were actually interviewed on g 
-- on 
Gu y  P a tin
, because most of them
 were survivors.  
Q: So a numb er of you were interviewed? 
A: Oh yes, many people were interviewed. 
Q: Do you remember
 being interviewed 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Not at all, not at all. 

Q: You don™t remember. 
A: Not at all, not -- and I was so amazed when  my friend info
rmed me that my  interview 
was on th e internet, and I couldn™t believe it.
 I said, ﬁThat™s not possible, I was never 
interviewed.ﬂ And well -- and I -- 
and yes, and I went to the 
internet, and I saw my name. 
Q: And you saw the transcript? 
A: I didn™t see the transcript. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
179
A: I don™t know how I -- I wa -- I -- actually --
 I don™t know, I had a di -- I -- I wasn™t that 
well versed in the computer use that I could do
 that. So I think I notified then my  son, and 
he located it right away.  
Q: Right. 

A: He locate it and he provided me with ev
erything. And I told hi
m I™m not happy with  
having it published without my  permission, and 
he located whoever was in charge of that 
project, and -- and they removed my  name -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- and my  tape and everything off the intern
et. And this is how it wasn™t listed. It was 
not listed on the list of interviewees. 
Q: Right, it was taken off. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yes. So you have ab solu tely no reco
llection of him, or 
the day or anything? 
A: I have ver -- I -- I can have on
ly recollection by listening to -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- to my voice. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Because that I recognize. And I vaguely re
cognize his too, because I apparently had -- 
and I rememb ered -- and I have a very neg -- 
a rather negative memo ry of the interview, 
because I felt myself be very vulnerable during that interv
iew. Not -- yeah, right, for 
some reaso n , I don™t know, just listening to the tape. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
180
Q: That you were feeling vulnerable. 
A: Right. 
Q: And did you feel he was be
ing aggressive, or you were a
fraid of him, do you think? 
A: I think I was afraid of him. I think he
 mu st have reminded me of my  Professor 
Napadiewich
. He had that way about him, yo
u know, like condescending way of a 
professor speaking down to  his student. No
t an American professor, but a German 
professor, or the Russian professor from befo
re the war, which is 
a different thing. 
Q: Right. 
A: Right. 
Q: Then that™s what you -- that
™s what you recall feeling? 
A: Yeah, so I felt -- I -- I don™t know how 
I felt. Tha -- in the beginning I felt co-
comfortable, I think. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: When I started answering question, but la
ter on I think it changes. But I -- I gave him 
the answers as best I co uld, I guess, and that™s how it was. 
Q: What do you think about him now? 
A: Well, I think he -- I have a great admira
tion for him. I don™t know h-how he was -- 
what mo tivated him to do what he did. Wh ethe
r it was a desire for a -- for fame, or was it 
a genuine research of a scientist. I mean, ger 
-- and was the general desire of a scientist to 
want to research? Probably 
both, I imagine it was both. 
Q: He didn™t become famous. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
181
A: Well he didn™t, but -- but he is famous
 now, and he will be even more famous. 
Q: Yes, that may be -- that may be true. 
A: He was -- it will be posthumous. 
Q: Yes. 

A: His fame is going to  be posthumous, but -- 
but he certainly earned it. He definitely 
earned it. 
Q: What did you think when 
you listened to yourself? 
A: Well, I didn™t like myself too well -- 
Q: Why? 
A: -- on that tape. I don™t know. I -- I -- I -- ma
ybe because it™s different to look at it from 
the hindsight. I felt that I -- I 
-- I shouldn™t be fee-feeling so 
-- so vulnerable, that I should 
have been mo re responsive to 
his questions in terms of if 
I didn™t like him I could have 
said so. But I didn™t, I -- it seem
ed to me that I wanted to te
ll him what he wanted to hear. 
Q: You wanted to please him?  

A: Yes, right. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I -- I have this feeling now. I don™t know if
 it™s -- I -- I -- that too may be incorrect, but 
that™s what I think. But you 
know, it™s all speculation, yo
u specu -- you sp eculate about 
things like that. 
Q: Right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
182
A: Right. So  -- and I may be wrong even  now, but I have a great admiration for him, a -- 
y -- y -- you know, nobody wanted to hear our 
stories, nobody did, 
really. A-And th-the 
reception we received, it was a wonderful r eception -- I wa -- that I received in 
France
, 
both times. It was an inconditional positive re
gard, it was wonderful. But nobody really 
wanted to hear anything. Even I came to 
America
, none of my -- except for one cousin, 
none of my family wanted to hear. You s
ee, you s -- said, it™s okay, you are here now, 
and -- yeah. 

Q: Forget about it. 

A: Right, right. You know, and things 
like that you don™t forget, you li -- not 
[indecipherable]
 you don™t forg et it, but your uncons
cious mind doesn™t forget them, and 
it -- and it takes over. A-And I ne -- and you 
make decisions, and 
you make -- and you 
live according to what you™re -- 
yeah, what™s dictated to you 
by your past, in a way. So I 
would never forget it. So he 
was the only one who had dete
rminatio n, and the stamina a-
and interest to hear that. So I -- I think he 
deserves all th e credit he -- he should get. 

Q: Right. 

A: Right, that™s how I feel about him now. 
Q: You -- you know at least one othe
r woman that she ha
s spoken with -- 
A: I -- I -- maybe more than on
e, I me -- I -- I™m -- I™m just
 suspecting th e other one, too -
- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- but I am not hundred percent sure. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
183
Q: But 
Bella
, who lives outside of 
Paris -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- you™ve spoken to. 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Does she have a clear recollection abou
t him, or is she as vague as you are? 
A: According to -- well, I -- I know that that may be -- 
Elizabeth 
knows that, maybe, 
cause I don™t know, I have no idea, cause I didn™t speak to 
Bella 
about this.  
Q: I see. 

A: I only called her to find out if she™s willing 
to give the informati
on on request of Mr. 
Marziali
. 
Q: Uh-huh. From 
NPR, 
yes, yes. 
A: Right, and so  I checked with 
Sa ra
 because otherwise I wouldn™t give him her address. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And I assumed since she was willing to do it 
for him, that she would do it certainly for 
the Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
Q: Museum, right. 
A: So th at™s how it came about. And for some 
reason, I -- I have this uncan ny suspicion 
that the other w-woman might be another interviewee.  
Q: Mm-hm, right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
184
A: And -- and -- you, of course, this has to 
be checked out. I could have maybe even call 
her sometime, but you know, I haven™t been in 
touch with her for a long time. Maybe last 
year I called them. Every so of
ten I call them up to make sure
 that they are still around. 
Q: Did 
Franka
 stay in 
Paris? 
A: I don™t know wh at happened to  
Franka
. 
Q: You don™t know what happened -- 
A: 
Franka  
disappeared from my -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- horizon completely, yeah. 
What happened with her was 
that our -- our ways parted. 
Maybe not unnecesar -- not necessarily on a 
positive note, but not an unfriendly note 
either. 

Q: Right. 

A: I mean, not comp letely, we didn™t break up
 or anything. But she -- I heard -- the last I 
heard of her that she was adopted  by a na 
-- a Canadian  family and was going to  be 
brought -- 

Q: To 
Ca na da
? 
A: -- to 
Canada
. And I looked at her all over th
e place on the internet and in 
Ca na da
. I 
looked on -- for her under he
r assumed name, and under her real name that I k n ew. And 
of course, if she got married I wouldn™t know her married name. 

Q: Right, right. 
A: So, and we didn™t -- 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
185
Q: So you lo st her? 
A: I lost her, right. And she lost me.  
Q: Yeah. Hm. Well, th at™s interesting. Okay
, we™re going to change the tape, and let -- 
End of Tape 10 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
186
Beginn ing Tape 11 
Q: I said I had one question,
 but actually I have a coup
le. First of all, what was 
Franka , 
or 
Francesca™s 
full name? Her real name? 
A: Her real name was 
Roberta Lander
. 
L-a-n-d-e-r
.  
Q: That™s her real name? 
A: Her real name. 
Q: And what was her fake name? 
A: And her fake name was 
Francziszka Markowiecka
. 
Q: Huh. Where did she come from? 
A: Well, I think h-her fa
mily was of Ru ssian origin, but th ey ended up in  
Lwów
. 
Q: Sounds ita -- doesn™t sound Po lish. 
A: 
Lander
? 
Q: 
Lander. 
A: Well, that sounds Jewish and Polish. 

Q: Uh-huh, okay. 

A: It™s like 
Binder
. 
Q: Right, that™s true. 

A: And you can have 
Binders
 in 
Germa ny
, and there are 
Binders 
in French -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and in French there™
s even a street called an 
impasse binder
 somewhere. 
Q: Right. Just shows my 
ignorance, that™s all. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
187
A: Well -- I -- you -- 
Q: What about the other woman who you met in 
Lwów
 who came back with you -- oh, 
you met in 
Kraków. 
A: Oh, well sh -- sh -- I don™t know he
r assumed name, but her real name was 
Mary la 
Bard ach, B-a-r-d-a-c-h
, and I don™t know what was he
r -- I don™t reme mb er her married 
name. 
Q: Nice names. 
A: Right. No , nice Jewish names, you kn
ow. They -- but they
 were Jewish in 
Poland
, and 
you had a Jewish name, that wa
s the end of you. I mean, not 
[indecipherable]
 of you, but 
of your career, of your anything. 

Q: Do -- do you have a sense of how
 th is history has affected you? 
A: I™m working on it. 

Q: You™re working on it. It™s hard, isn™t it? 
A: I™m working on it. Yeah, I 
-- I still don™t know how to ge -- explain it. I think that if I 
was formed by the Holocaust, I 
was much more formed by my
 upbringing and my  genes. 
And -- and the Holo caust may have reinforced wh
at was there, or destroyed some of it. I 
ya -- 

Q: Did it make you cynical in
 any way about human beings? 
A: I don™t think so. I don™t think so . No , no
, and I -- didn™t destroy my faith either.  
Q: Really? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
188
A: No, no, because I explain it -- I have my
 explanation which I 
find comfortable. And 
explanation is that we are all endowed with 
free will, and with a sense of responsibility 
and -- and we are responsib le for our acts. 
So I don™t blame God for what the Germans 
did. And I™m very, very existe
ntialistic about it. And maybe 
Jean-Paul Sa rtre
 had 
something to  do with  it. And -- and I feel th
at everybody™s responsible for his acts, and 
that™s it. And hiding behind
 God, or demon, it™s not going to -- or devil, or 
Satan
, it™s not 
going to  do any good. That™s my  philo sophy. 

Q: Right. 

A: Right. 
Q: So I know that you ma
rried in 1950 or ™51. 
A: ™51, yes. 
Q: Came to the 
United States
 in ™53. 
A: Right. 
Q: You married a survivor. 
A: Right. 

Q: Who unfortunately passed away in ™77. 
A: Right, yeah. And he was in 
Warsaw
, he -- he participate in the resistance, he 
smuggled papers, and probably  arms too, but
 I™m not hundred percent sure about that. 
And -- and he went th rough 
Pawiak, 
which is a horrendous prison. 
Q: Right. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
189
A: And he got hims
elf deported to 
Germany
, which was -- which was absolutely a 
tour 
de force, 
because for a Jew, get deported to 
Germany
, it™s just incredible. They had to 
go th rough the physical examination, and -- 
and if you were circumcised, that was 
obvious, but he sometime -- some how -- somehow he managed that. 
Q: Right. 

A: And he was farmed  out to the farmers. So
 he worked on the f -- on the farms. And he 
had very hard wo rk, he had to work  very  
hard. And -- and w -- at the liberation he was 
actually working for the American army, and 
-- as an interpreter, and he had a di -- 
uniform and a motorcycle, a
nd -- and he was happy, 
I guess. Until he got to 
Belgium,
 and 
it was the -- this particular, seventh, 
I think, regiment, was transferred to 
Belgiu m
, and in 
Belgium
 they -- they no longer need
ed a German translator. So 
he was -- how shall I say? 
He was let go. And -- but he ha
ppened to have
 family in 
France
, so he went to 
France
, 
to 
Paris
. And one day he needed  some info
rmation in the office near the 
Guy Patin. 
And 
he knocked on the door of the office, ther
e was some writing on the wall -- on the door, 

but I don™t remember what it was, and lo and behold there were thre
e girls there instead 

of the office. And so  he -- he was very happy, 
and he told his story and th e girls told their 
story and he started dating one of
 the girls, but it wasn™t me.  
Q: Oh. 

A: Right. And it was my girlfriend 
Mary la
, and well, I -- I -- but I -- I guess she wanted 
to get married, and he wasn™t ready to get 
married. And he found a good listener in me, 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
190
so I took her place. And that™s how it went
. And we got married 
in 1951. No, 1950. 
Right, 1950. 
Q: 1950. 
A: Right. 

Q: And your first son was born in 
Paris
? 
A: Right, right. And then we -- I -- I had to
 -- you know, in the meantime I applied to 
American embassy for the visa, and for my  vi
sa, I don™t know why I had to wait so long. 
I didn™t obtain the visa until six years of wa
it, and I found many people who got it much 
sooner, out of 
Germany
. They -- they got the visa
 sooner than I got it in 
Paris.
 And then  
my -- I got my -- since I got married, my hu
sband had to get a visa, too. So  it took 
another two years.  

Q: Right. 

A: So we waited there for eight year
s. We wait there -- w e didn™t wait -- 
Q: Where? 

A: -- waiting in 
Paris 
is okay. 

Q: Is -- is -- is not so bad. 
A: Right, right, yeah. 
Q: Right. And you ha
d two mo re children? 
A: But I had -- they were born in 
Chicago. 

Q: Right. 
A: Yeah. 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
191
Q: So you have 
three boys, right. 
A: I have th ree boys, right. 
Q: And we will stay here all night if we go into your life -- 
A: Right, absolutely, yeah. 

Q: -- all -- all time -- 

A: Yeah, right. 
Q: -- and so maybe we™ll do that at another time. 
A: Sure. 

Q: But I want to thank you. I 
can™t tell you how mu ch I thank you. 
A: Oh well, you™re most welcome, I -- I -- I™m 
the one to thank you, because the fact that 
you want to hear it, that™s -- that
™s -- makes ro om for my gratitude. 

Q: Well, we all thank you. I thank you so very mu ch. 

A: Thank you. 
Q: Cause it was wonderful to be with your today. 
A: Thank you so  mu ch. 

Q: And 
Janine
, who is this? 
A: This is my  grandmother 
Aurelia
, on my  mo ther™s side, and th is is picture of my  
grandfather
 Herman. 
And most of these pictures we
re taken on th eir wedding day, I 
believe, in 1899, or 1898. 

Q: And who is this? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
192
A: This is a photograph of my mother at th
e age of two, taken by her father in the living 
room of their home. 
Q: And who is this, 
Janine
? 
A: This is my father, before his 
marriage, in the Austrian uniform. 
Q: How old -- how old 
do you th ink he was? 
A: He was probably  recruited in 1914 or 
1915, and he was born in  1889, so you can 
figure it out, I -- my  math isn™t that good. 
Q: Would this have been the photograph on 
the wall, when he spoke to the Germans? 
A: No, no, he was standing up, no. I don™t th
ink th is is an officer™s unifo rm. I-It™s a 
unifo rm of a corporal, probab
ly. Th -- there was another pi
cture and he -- in which he 
was standing, not sitting. 

Q: And this shot? 

A: And this shot, it -- this is also my father
 after the war probably
, but I don™t know in 
what year it was taken.  

Q: And this couple? 

A: Is -- these are my parents on their wedding
 day. And that would 
have been in  1924. 
Q: And who is down below there? 

A: And this is picture of me at the age of
 two. And I™m very scared looking because -- 
that™s because I am scared.  

Q: And this picture? 

U S HMM  A r chiv es R G- 50 .56 2*0 004 
 
 
193
A: And this is a picture of my  mo th

Jaremcze
, and 
we are facing a beautiful river, so we ha
ve a beautiful view from where we sit. 
Q: And here? 
A: And this is a picture of my  parents and 
me. I™m about 11 years old at the time, and we 
are in 
Jarem cze
, again, more or less in the same pl
ace. It™s a beach in -- on a river, and 
it™s very stony because it™s a moun
tain river -- mountain stream. 
Q: And who is this? 

A: And this is my Aunt
 Wa nda
 and her brother, who is my  uncle, but whom I call by the 
first name anyway. And they are on
 vacation also, in a place called
 Zo p p o t ,
 which is on 
the 
Baltic 
Sea
. 
Q: Do you know if he
 survived the war? 
A: Yes, he did.
