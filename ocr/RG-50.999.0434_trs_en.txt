law. T he smallf actory had loom s to 
weave native Ukrainian clothing that was then sold in the store. The house onthe right side was the 
store as well as thefam ily hom e.  
 
 
In 1940, the Soviet Arm y m arched into Vascauti anddraf ted youngm en, including Rita's 
father, into the arm y.  When Axis troops invadedthe Soviet Union the next year, Rom anian soldiers 
entered Vascauti and told all the Jews toprepare to leave within 24hours.  Rita'sf am ily was able to 
bribe Rom anian soldiers who took thefam ily to a ghetto inT ransnistria. T he area known as 
T ransnistria is shown on thism ap.  Oncethere, a 
villa ge  f a m ily t o o k Rit a ' s  f am ily in .   Rit a  wa s  a b le  t o 
attenda small class,but during the three years thefam ily lived in the ghetto they faced terrible 
hardships.  After they were liberated thefam ily was eventually able to return home.  
 
 
Af ter the war, Rita attended a Ukrainian school in what had becom e comm unist Romania. By 
obtaining falsepapers, Rita, her mother and her aunt were ableto travel from Rom ania toa displaced 
persons camp inGermany that was adm inistered by the US Arm y. Here we see R
it a  in h er P u rim  
co st um e .   
 

 
Rita arrived in the United States in 1949 with her mother and her mother's husband,an 
Auschwitz sur vi vor, whom  shem et in thedisplacedpersons cam p.T hey settled in New York City.  

Rita m arried Nathan Rubinstein in1959. She graduatedf rom  Brooklyn College in 1960, then she and 
Nathan moved to Maryland, where Rita began teaching elem entary school in Olney, Maryl and, just 
outside ofW ashington, DC.

Af ter retiringf rom  the school, Rita becam ea pri vate tutorf orbar andbatmitzvahs, including for 
adults who haven't had their bar and bat

Nathan passedaway at age 58 in1995.  He had lost most of hisfam ily during the Holocaust, 
buthe survi ved with his parents inSiberia. Af ter the war, they came to the UnitedStates. Af ter 
service in the USArm y, Nathanbegana career as a 
scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Research 
Lab in Baltim ore, with a top secret clearance.  
 
T heir three daughters have a com bined eight grandchildren.  Daughter Nina is an 
industrial psychologist with t wo children.  Daughter Sheri is an attorney with four children. And Rene 
is a pediatric nurse at Johns Hopkins Hospital with t wo children. Several grandchildren just reached

Rita, thank you so much for joining us, beingwi lling to be our 
F i rs t  Pe rs o n
. W ehave an hour 
anda greatdealfor you to share with us. W e'll start.  AlthoughW orldWar II began with Germ any 
invading Poland in September 1939, the war didn't come directly toyour community in Rom ania until 
1940.  Bef ore we turn to the war years and your lif e during the Holocaust,tell us what yourfam ily's 
lif e was like, their community, andeven your early years bef ore thewar began for you.  
 
>> I cam ef rom a very happy, loving f am ily.  My m other cam ef rom a small town.  She was theeldest 

of  eight children. T wo siblings had diedbefore the war.  She was thef irst to get married,f irst to have 
a grandchild.  I was the only grandchild. Soyou can imagine I was
 
a little spoiledand adored.  But it 
didn't last very long, only f our years of m y lif e.  
 

 
My f ather was one offour children.  Hism om was widowed inW orldW ar I, so the oldertwo 
im m igrated tothe United States way bef oreW orldW ar II.  They were 16 and 18 and worked in

dry goods store wherethey sold costum es that the local Ukrainianswere wearing.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you go any further, since you mentioned that, tell usabout thephotograph.  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Yes, if  you look at the new exhibits, " TheyW ere Our Neighbors, OurFriends," as 

you com e in on the right

It is

hand side,and it'sthe secondpicture.  It has no captions, but you will see native 
costum es,and in theback you will see Europeans wearing bow ties.  My f ather was one of those with 

the hat on.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Inf act, that exhibit," Som eW ere Neighbors," is right outside our door, to the right.  
You walk into thef rontpart, the second picture on the right.  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  My father's mother lived with us.  Thanks toher, m yf irst language really was 

Yiddish.  Mostof  thepeople in our town spoke Germ an totheir children, Jewish people, but they 
thought it was m ore intellectual.  However, m y grandmother insisted that they speak Yiddish with m e. 
 
 
My m other worked in the store. She loved being a businesswom an.  She hada nan
ny f or m e.  
W ehad a very m odern house:  W ehad electricity. W e hada radio. W ehad bathroom s.There were 
no washing m achines. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas unusual, wasn't it?  Your house was unusualf or thetime?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Very unusualfor the time. T hey hired a washer wom an who cam e todo our 

laundry. T im es were very good.  I had lots oftoys, a doll carriage, lots of  friends,played with m y 
cousins, who shared the house with me;m y aunthad two children.

I recall, of course, I have to go backa while, like 72 years,m y father taking me to services.  He 
was m odernOrthodox, buteverybody was Or thodox, but we didnotwear any special costum e.  He 
just observed the 
S ab ba t h
 
and went to servic es.  Very pious, very c haritable, as werem y 
grand
parents.  My grandparentsalsoowneda dry good store and they hadanorchard.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfatherhad a terrif ic voice, right?
 
>> M y f ather hada wonderful voice, whichmy m other said I inheritedf rom  him.  He loved to do 

services.  I do too.  I volunteered about 18 years.  Ididm other's day and did Friday night services f or 
th em .  Ye s. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Germany andthe Soviet Union attacked Poland inSeptember 1939, launchingW orld 

W ar II.  It would be som e m onths later,however, the war cam e
 
to Rom ania, when the Soviets 
occupied your hom etown of Vascauti. Thatwas in 1940.  Although you're not yet4 years old, very 

young, tell us what you can about that time, that period when you were under the Soviet  occupation, 
what that m eant f or your f a
m ily and com munity.  You were ver y young.  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  It was short
-
li ved. W e were lim ited.  I was no longer playing in the streets. W e 
hadto close the store.  My m other's sister was lucky, she cam eto visit my mother
 
--
 
well, she worked 
there
 
for a year. Shewas with us, and when she wanted to go back hom e, she was no longer 
allowed to, which was her good luck.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ill you tell us more about why that was her good luck later?
 
>> Rit a  Ru b in s t e in :  Ye s ,  I  will.   T he  Ru s s ians  a  s h
ort while later took the able
-
bodied m en and 
draf ted them  into the arm y.  My f ather was am ongst them ,and notm y unclefor som e reason. That 

was the last tim e, when m y father left on atrain and the Russianunif orm, that I saw m y dad.  I will get

t o  it  la
ter how we f ound out when he died. Iwas 4 andnever was to see him again.  
 
 
It was a diff icult time.  Ever ything really changed. T he mood was sad.  My f ather, at the tim e 
we didn't know where he was going, butat least I know thathefought against thi
s.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  Maybe this will be a tim eto just mention what youbrought with you.  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Yes, I will.  Since youmention it now, what you see is a prayer shawl.  That's the 
only thing that brings m e close tom y f ather. His spirit is with m e. He's theref or every one of m y 
grandchildrens' bar and bat m itzvahs, when a boy and girl turn 13. 
 
 
My m other, amazingl y enough, Idon't know how, but she held on toit hoping that he would 
return after the war.  Ihave it and wear itf or the
 
high holidays.  My late husband used to wear it.  Now 
I wear it for the high holidays.  It's presentona chair. All of m y grandchildrenand

grandchildren, it's amazing how it li ved through the war.  
 
T h is  is  s te rlin g s ilve r.   I  a lwa ys  f e lt  t he  
only thing I had clean.  My father was presented 
with this.  It's custom ary for the parents of the bride to present their future son

law with a prayer 
shawl.  T hat's whatm y grandparents did. Let's see,78 years old. Pretty well preser ved.  It's ver y 

close to m y heart.  I know the museum had wanted it,but I said, I'm sorry, it has tobe inherited by m y 
grandchildren,hopefully m y f uture great

grandchildren.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter we hear m oref rom  Rita, what happensaf terthis, thefact that yourm other was 

able to hang on tothatduring that time just seem s tom etobeextraordinary.  Just extraordinary.  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:   It's ver y close tom y heart.

Shortly af ter the Rom anians came back. T hat was

>> Bill Benson: T hatwas June 1941?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Correct.  
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:  German turned on the Soviets at that point. The Rom anians cam e in, allies of the 
Ge rm an s.  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Definitely.  T im es were really bad. They announcedthey were back. T hey cam e 
m arching into the street.  Inf act,m y cousin, who was aboutf ive years older than I, looked through an 
attic window, and suddenly we had
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Looked through atthe marching Rom anians com ing into town.  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Yes.  W itha bayonet. Said,T here's a spy here. W e children were sof rightened.  
W ehid underthe bed. They came in with bayonets.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hinking there was a spy?
 

>> Rita Rubinstein:  Yes.  Finally, m y m other and aunt were crying, " He's only a child."  They pulled 
him  out," Please leave us alone."  T hey left. T o
 
show everybody that they were back, they took 20 
Jews at random and they shot them.  Oneof  the 20 was anengineer who happened to work in the 

sam e off ice with m y Aunt Bella.  
 
In September of 1941,they announcedtoall of  the Jews that we had tobe read

m y m other took theTorah, afew of m y f ather's suits.  I was bundledinto layers of  clothing. I had a 
knapsack on m y back. 
 
 
My m other took som ebedding, because we alwa ys took som ebedding.  And she was bundled 
up. W hatever we could carry. W e were toldtom eet in a marketplace, and f romthere we were taken 

away.  Didn't know where we would be going.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou were f orced out and you gathered thefew things that you were able to 

take with you, I think you toldm e you were able to hide som ethings in the house.  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Yes.  My m other hid pictures.  Pictures are very precious commodities to 

s u r vi vo r s .  S u r vi vo r s  v e r y 
of ten ask me,or people who suffered tragedies like recently, thef iresand 
thef loods, they lost the pictures, but they still hadf am ily m embers. We were lucky we did send some 
pictures tom y f am ily that we had here, butfor them ost part m y mother hid album s of pictures and 
she also had hidden money in the attic.  
 
 
T alkabouthiding, m ygrandm other,m ay she rest in peace, she had m oney sewn in her 
undergarm ents, underwear.  She said "W enever know.  T hism ight save our lives."   She certainly 
wa s ri gh t. 
 
I will com e to that later.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now you're forced, with 24 hours' notice, to leave.W here do you go?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein: T ell m e, where shall I go? W e were taken by train to a holding place. W e were 
on our play toT ransnistria, but mostof  thepeople were off to deathcam ps. T hat cousin you saw a 
picture of, she was in that death camp. Andfam ily m em bersdiedthere.  My unclefound out,m y 
father's brother

in

law, that some Rom anian soldiers would get bribed and would take some ofthe

J
ews to a ghetto. Even though they tookthebribes,m any of the children were thrown intothe 
Ne ste r.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he river?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Yes, very lar ge body of water.  My uncle found out wherem y grandma'sf am ily 
was going, they were going
 
toT ransnistria.  So with them oney m y grandm other had,hebribedthe 
Rom anian soldiers and they took us thereonbarges.  A Romanian soldier was holding me.I was 

blonde at the tim e. I guess he saw the anguished look onm y m other's face and tears in her
 
eyes, 
andhe said," Don't worr y.  I'm  not going to harm  your child.  I have a little girl just like that at hom e."   

T hat was one tim e I was lucky.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Had your uncle not bribed them , you would likely then have been sent to a death 
c a m p?
 
>> 
Rita Rubinstein: W e were being sent to aghetto,toT ransnistria. The ghetto was called 
Shargorot. People were takenf rom there to labor camps.  My auntwas to bepickedupby two 

soldiers. T here was a possibility f orus, it was not strict, to go toa market, but we had no money.  
She would sew f or Christians after she cam eback. Som epeople sent som e clothing, she'd get 
m oney, so we couldhave bread once in a while, and some soupandpotatoes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're now in Shargorot.  
 
>> Rit a  Ru b i
nstein:  InShargorot.  How did we live in Shargorot?  AJewish f am ily was forced to take 
us in.  Conditions were very, ver y prim iti ve.  Rem ember what I told you aboutm y good home life? 
Here there was a clay, really like a clay hut.  It had one bedroom . 
 
T hey were af am ily offour.  A 
potbelly stove.  No electricity, of  course. And that stove would act as we cookedon it, whatever they

had, and also people slept on it,because it gave us warm th inthe winter. The winters wer e bitter 
cold.  
 
T here were nobathroom s. W eall used,excuse me, a pail,toelim inate. It was bitter 
cold and very hardf or us children.  Andhunger.  You saw death in the streets. W e were the lucky 
ones, because som ebody tookus in.Theone bedroom ,there were four people,and we
 
cam e with 
nine people.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  On top of thef our they had?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  On top of thef our.  But these conditions were good compared to Auschwit z and 

Dachau. T hat's why it tooka long tim e to speak toanybody.  Ithought, I'm notprivile ged enough. I 
lost a lot.  I lostm y hom e, my childhood, I lost m yf am ily.  
 
 
T he living there was ve ry, ver y diff icult, but a child always likes to play, so we wouldf ind rocks 
in the street.  My m other m adea rope,a jumping rope. A little kindergarten class wasf orm ed where I 

learned songs,and I was thrilled to be able
 
--
 
we learned som e Hebrew letters and words.  W hen I 
was able tobring a piece of bread andoil, itwas a treat. I was able to say, in Hebrew, that I had 

breadand oil yesterday.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You described tom e, and you were in Shargorotfor three years, living in the 
circum stances you described, it was
 
--
 
as hard as things were, there were som e good tim es in there, 
in the m iddleof  those hard tim es.  You were just describing one of those.  
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Right, right.  But a lot ofbadtim es.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  For three years.

m other. She kept usand herself  very clean. It was about a m ileaway f rom the house shehadto go 
to a river and wash clothes. I rem em ber this incident, because certain things you remem ber.  I went 
with m y cousin. W e had a little rag dollm adef or us.  Suddenly, m y cousin said tom y m other, "Oh
, I 
see a little girl in the water." W ell, this little girl was I.  Ididn't know how to swim .  My m other didn't 
know how to swim .  I guess I fell in. 
 
Som y m other took a sheet she was washing,  and she threw it in and picked me outof  
the water, but I was so traum atized I could not speakf or several days. T hey had a
 
--
 
witch cra ft.  
T hey called som e woman,and she said something like " Abracadabra,"  whatever, she broke an egg 

onm y f orehead.  I couldn't speak.  My m other was really concerned. Then suddenly, I guess her 
witchcraf t worked, I started speaking again.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Otherwise, this girl happened tonotice you out inthe river, you would have drowned 

otherwise?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Right, I would have drowned.  My uncle got very ill.  He had typhoidf ever.  T hey 
stayed with us only about a year. T hen conditions were ver y bad. They had to leave. T hey lef tfor 
another labor cam p.  Later we connected back in

>> Bill Benson: T hatwas your uncle,his wife and a couple kids, two children?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Couple kids andhis brother.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Five ofthem ?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Yes.  Yes. They lef t.  My grandma, inthemeantim e, who was with us, m y 
father's m other, she was very i ll, and inthe Jewish religion, and Ithink in Muslim also, it's custom ary 
to wear white.  Theseare called shrouds. She was sewing these shrouds.  I was a child, Iasked,

"W hat isthis?"   She said, "When Idie,I wantto be buried in it."  She had a little packet of soil, and 
she said that soil is f rom  Israel, and it's custom ary for us to be buried with soil f rom Israel.

Rom anians lef t. Now your town is under Soviet occupation,as they're m oving west ward.  W hat's life

theirf am ily and tookus along with them . Afam ily m em berhad a subbasement.  Youheard the

T hen we said, OK, let's go outand see what's really happening. W hen we cam e out, we saw 
that, indeed, it was true.  So we cried

husband was a Ukrainian national leader. He connected us with a Russian soldier, andthis Russian 
soldier took usonam ilitary train.  He helpedus to get tothe town. But when we got there, our home 
was occupiedby the Russianm ilitary, and they used it asa warehousef or grain.  
 
 
My m other begged them  to, "Please letme in thehouse. I just want to retrieve pictures." T hey 
gave her a very hard tim e.  She said, " My husbandf ought in your arm y.  Please letm e in."  At that 
point, she didn't know that he was already gone.  
 
 
T hey f inally relentedand let her in, and she retrieved the photos that I have. T he money was 
gone, but that didn't matter.W e were poor,but we had our lives.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  But they weren't going to give you the home back?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  No, no, no, we weren't allowed.  My great

grandparents were living in

they had 
a housethere too.  This soldier, eventhoughit was occupied, insisted that thepeople let us have one 

room .  So m y mother and I and her sister hadone room , and we were able to settle there. I s
ta rte d to 
go to school there,a Ukrainian school,f irst grade.  It was about am ile and ahalf of  walking in the 

woods.  
 
 
T here they indoctrinated the little children to love Stalin and Stalin's picture and to kiss him  
bef ore we went to bed.  I had to recite apoem in Ukrainian.  I learned Ukrainian, of  course.  I walked 
to the school with m y cousin.

So your mother and your Aunt Bella, you were able to escapef rom comm unist Rom ania. How did 
you do that?  Do you know how they m ade that happen?
 
>> Rita Rubinstein:  Yes.  W ehad documents that were falsif ied, saying that we were born in Poland.  

It was hard,butthe underground, som ehow they did it. And we got on a train.  My aunt was noton 
the train. The Russians were not ready to give up on her.T hey wouldn't let her go,actually. T hen 
f inally, when the train was aboutto leave, she was allowed to leave.  But our journey was a long, long 
journey.  It tookus three monthsf rom  our town in Rom ania to get toGerm any.  Becausethe song, 
there was a song writt en "Tell me where shall I go? T here's no placef or me.  T othe lef t, to the right?  
Ever y door is closeto m e."  
 
That'show it felt.  Our goal was to reach Germ any, where they set up this 
displaced persons camp.

persons camps?

>> Bill Benson:  Question for you. W hen your m om  was able to get the papersthat said you were 
Polish, why was that signif icant? W as it because then you weren't Rom anian and they couldn't keep 
you?  Is thatthe idea?

som e good in people. If you would only speak up.W e could have beenarrested.  If he revealed our

labeled as"T he Jews."  Conditions were notwonderful, because we were in barracks. W ehadone

I remember going ontrips, putting on plays. T hat's when I started singing up on stage.  
One incident which got to m y m other, she was sitting in the audience as I was
 
s in
ging a song on the 
stage.  A wom an said to her, " I wonder if  thischild's mother isalive li stening to her."   Of course, m y 
m other burst into tears.  She said " Yes. I am them other."   She said, " You are so lucky.  I lost two 
children inthe cam ps."  You heard so many of those stories.
 
T he cam p too I started speaking Polish,because som e of m yf riends were hidden. T hey 
were good Poles too, hidden either in convents or hidden in Christian homes. Som etimes they didn't 
want to give the Jewish children up.  But they only spokePolish.  So I was forced to learn that 
language too. W henpeople metm y m other on the street they started speaking Polishtoher.  " I'm  
notf rom Poland. I'mf rom  Romania."   As a child you pick up languages, and I was ver y happy there, 
believe it or not.  
 
 
T hena lotof us were very sick as a resultof  the poor nourishm ent we received during thewar.  
I was diagnosed with having T B.  I was put ina sanitarium , only able to see my mother once a week.  
My m other had leftm ewith m any children. She cam e back a week later, she couldn'tf indm e.  She 
said, "W here ism y daughter Rif ka?"  T hey said, "W ehad to put her in quarantine."   I hada very bad 
ca se  of  T B .   
 
At that tim ethey rationed, they gave out streptom ycin topeople whohadTB of 
t he  
bones, andI had itof  the lungs.  They said Iwould need surgery to collapsethe lung, unless I got the 
stre p tom ycin .  
 
 
Also, I wanted to bringout, in thathospital there were a lot of anti
-
Sem itic nurses.  Every tim e I 
went for a test,they would give m ea tissue and say " You'll need it. T his is going to hurt."  I said " No,

it won't.  I will not need it.  Iam not going to cry.  T his too shall pass."  
 
 
T hey were hard tim es,but thank God there was a very kind doctor,Danish. She saidtomy 
m other
," Don't worr y.  She will be f ine."  W hat scaredus, we knew we would have topass ver y strict

exam s on Ellis Island. You had tobeexam ined bef ore you went ontheboat. T hat is if  you m et the

never forget May
 
15, 1948, when Israel was declared independent. All the children in the school, we 
stayed up all night long singing and dancing. Finally, the Jews hadtheir hom eland. W e had aplace

because hisparents wrote him

we didn'thave any documentation.  His parents thoughthe would

My m other wrote me two years younger.  I changed it.  Now I'm  going legal.  I changed 
it.  But unf ortunately, I lost m y husbandat 58. I saidI'm no longer 1938.  All my documentswere 

1938.  Allm y f riends thought I was two years younger thanI really am . ButI cam e out, I cam e clean,

T he journey was horrible.  I wanted to pointout, we were right near the engine room ,and they

W e'
ll ge t the m ic to yo u .  
 
>> I notice that you mentioned Danish doctor.  And in the sanitarium .  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Danishdoctor was the tuberculosis sanitarium .  The Danishdoctor.  
 
>> I happentobe Danish, not born here inAm erica. But isn't therea special relationship between the 

Danish people and the Jewish people? Talking about when Hitlerf irst tookover Denmark to get the 
Jewish peopleout, and there was very little, as I understand, very l ittle loss of any Jewish people 
ge ttin g o u t. I'm to l
d that the Gestapoor theGerm an soldiers would check thef ishing boats, and there 
would be Jewish people in thef ishing

in the holdsof  thef ishing boats, but they didn't want to get 
their bootsdirty getting out in the holds. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T he gentlem an's question, itm ight not be one that you're able to answer.  T he 

question is really the role of Danes and theirresistanceto theGermans and whether or not

how 
m any Jews they were able to protector save.  I don't know if that's som ething you
 
want to speak to.

sanitarium . Absolutely.
