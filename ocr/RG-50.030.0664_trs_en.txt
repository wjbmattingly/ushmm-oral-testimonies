Q: Uh-huh.
 

A: There was a tall man.  I remember him, his 
face.  I ask him, "Can  I have your jacket

able--would you have been 
allowed to move around th e bo

So where do you reme mb er that you stopped?
 
A: I--I remember France--that there.  And they

a few people came running with
 food and bread.  And they  
said--you know, they
 put their hands in the bag.  And th
ey  told us, "Don't  go down.  Stay  
on th e ship."
 
Q: Do you know why 
th ey  to ld  you  th at?
 
A: I don't know.  They wanted maybe we 
should--if not, they--they going to  kill us 
maybe--the English.  I don't know.  They  wo uld never let us in.
 
Q: So the French told 
you to stay on th e boat.
 
A: Yes.  And they--maybe they knew th
at they taking us back to Hamburg.
 
Q: When you talked about the 
bread with wo rms, did you ev er participate in any hunger 
strike?
 
A: Oh, we did, yes.  When  we
 came to the France--to France, 
we told them that.  That's

Q: Okay .
 

A: Water, we had.  Water, yes.
 
Q: Now, after you are in Fran

A: The next stop was Hamburg.
 
Q: Okay.  So how--so wh
en you were in France, before y'
all left to go back to  Hamburg, 
did any of you think ab out tryi
ng to get off the boat, or di
d you th ink about getting off the 
boat?  Wh at were your thoughts?
 
A: No, no.  Because we kept together.  We 
still thought in Hambur
g we will go back to 
Israel.  We are going
 to try to go back.
 
Q: Did y'all talk about that 
and make a decision as a group?
 
A: No.  Everybody talked ab ou
t it.  There wasn 't really groups.  We were because we 
came there together, you know, the 
first time before we went to
 Israel before we went on 
the Exodus.  So we had a few 
that we know each other.  We
 got to know a few people.  
But not all of them, you know.
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
 
A: But we--we talked to--we go
ing to try again and ag ain be
cause we didn't have where 
to go some place else.
 
Q: So your thought--did  you 
think if you were going to go b
ack to  Palestine, going to 
Hamburg was the best idea?
 
A: Yes.  We didn't know that because when  we came  there, you know, like in Germany, 
they had like--how you say in English?
  I don't know.  You understand Yiddish?
 
Q: Not very well.
 
A: You know like--like they we
nt up th ere and to look who--if somebody does run aw ay.  
I don't know how you call that.
 
Q: Like a lookout?
 
A: Lookout.  Yeah, lookout. 
 And they looked, you know, 
if somebody was able to run 
away or what.  English.
 
Q: Well, Like a guard tower or a --
 
A: Yeah.  ____+ so we had them for a few da
ys.  But then  they disappeared.  We don't 
know how, when  they  disapp
eared .  Maybe a few people left.  I don't know.  And then 
came the--I don't know--not the Haganah, 
maybe another organiza
tion, you know, from 
Israel.  And they taught us 
how to shoot, how to
 go and--to jump from a window out, you 
know?
 

Q: So th is is when you we
re already back in  Hamburg.
 
A: Hamburg, yes.
 
Q: So let's back up ju st a minute.  How did 
it feel when you--you 
get to the port at 
Hamburg? 
 
A: Oh, it was very--what can we do?  We knew
 that--that's--that's it
.  We have no other 
way.
 
Q: Did they--did you know where you were go
ing once you got to Hamburg?  Did they 
say where you--
 
A: No.  We didn't know wh ere we going to--no, 
 
because--told they going to take us to Cyprus
 because a lot of people, they went--they 
took to Cyprus.  So we didn't  know 
exactly where they going to take us.
 
Q: So when you get to Hamburg, what 
happens when  the boat 
gets to the port?
 
A: So we--we all went down from there from th
e boat.  Everybody went
 out.  They told 
us to go out.  And th ey watched us.  We 
shouldn't run away, you know, we (?should?) go 
someplace else.
 
Q: And did they tell you, when
 you were coming off the boa
t, wh ere they were taking 
you?
 
A: They said, "We going to  take
 you back from where you came."
 
Q: And where did you end up going to ?
 
A: That was--that was in
 Hamburg.  That's all.
 
Q: But what was--were you in a DP--or what
 was the name of the kibbutz or the DP 
camp?  Where were you located?
 
A: I was in Auschwitz-Birkenau.  They  didn't sa
y that.  Nothing.  Th
ey didn't  t alk about 
the--the camps, no.
 
Q: No.  But when you--no, I mean the disp
laced persons camp .  When you--w hen you get 
off the boat in Hamburg, wh ere do you go in Hamburg?
 
A: I don't know.  We stayed in
 Hamburg.  We didn't go no place.
 
Q: So were you in a displaced persons ca
mp ?  Where were you being held?  Were you 
allowed--could you leave?
 
A: I don't remember if we stayed in th
e city or we--we--or they took us--I don't 
remember.  I think we stayed 
in the city some or--I don't 
know.  That I don't remember.
 

Q: Were you allowed to leave you, or are were you still under--
 
A: Some people left.  When  they  left, you know,
 they  didn't watch us anymore.  So some 
people left.  Some people, I think, stayed in 
Germany, too.  I don't 
know.  I don't know.  I 
was--we wasn't thinking, you 
know.  Too young to think.
 
Q: So how long do you think y
ou were in Hamburg at that time?

k.  Two months, maybe.

A: We came to Hamburg from Is
rael the first time in 1947.

feel about that?

us on the way the--the men--there was a 
few men also and women older than me, and 
they to ld us, "If you go in  the army , you

Q: Right.
 
A: I came from a very religious family.  So 
I said I'm not going in  the army  to have a 
baby.  Wh at I'm going to do with a baby?  So 
they took blood from me.  But I was hiding.  
Three nights I was sleeping under--three co
uples were in a room
, and I was hiding at 
night under their bed.  They  didn't even know th
at I am there.  And so
 after the third day--
they came from a kibbutz ___+.  And they  ask 
who wants to go in a kibbutz.  So me and 
other two people we went there.  So there was 
no men there.  They sh
ould do th
e work in 
a kibbutz, you know.  I was worked  there very , 
very hard .  For a year I stayed in kibbutz.
 
Q: What did you--what was your job?
 
A: There all the--every time they changed.  
First, was from the bananas to--to take down  
the leaves, the big leaves, you know, with a big 
knife.  The--the sun should co me to the 
bananas.  They would get ri
pe.  And th en the second wa
s I--I worked  in the kitchen 
because I knew--I told
 them I know how to work
 in the kitchen.  And the third job was to 
wash the diapers from babies.  And no money.
  They didn't--they 
just give you short 
pants, long pants, khaki.  Y
ou know, for khaki?  And sandals.
  And th at's it.  And food.  
Okay.  We were happy.  We had food.  We had where to sleep.  And I was there for a 

year.  A year's time.
 
Q: Did your brothers emigrate or--

Yeah.  I came first, yes.
 

Q: Well, Palestine at th e time--sorry--actually.

  And there I got to k
now my husband, also, 
in 1950.
 
Q: And how long were
 you in Israel?
 
A: 11 years.
 
Q: And why did you come to the United States?
 
A: I don't know.  We had a friend.  He ca
me before us, and he said, "You co me to 
America.  Your husband is going to make a 
lot of money" and you 
this-and-that.  And we 
came, and I'm sorry to the day.
 
Q: You wish  you would have stayed in Israel?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Did you--after the journey on
 the Exodus, were you--d id yo
u stay in touch with people 
that you had gone through that experience with?
 
A: That we went together to--on the Exodus?
 
Q: Well, if they were on the 
Exodus with you, this was th
e same group of people when  
you went back to Palestine.
 
A: Yes.  You know what?  When we came ba
ck to Hamburg, we--everybody--every girl 
has to wash clothes for three guys, you know,
 because the men didn't know how to  wash 
clothes.  So everybody had to--e
very girl had three boys to wash fo r them clothes.  And 
we did that, you know.  We were very clos
e, one with each other, but not, you know--we 
were always together.
 
Q: And did you stay in
 touch with them when you lived in  Israel?
 
A: Yes, yes.  Yes.  They--even one of them, 
too, wanted to marry 
me.  But--we were still 
young, and we didn't--we didn't know wh at we 
want, you know.  We didn't h ave nothing.  
We didn't have no mo ney.  We didn't have our
 home.  We didn't have nothing.  So  that's 
why everybody lived  for himself, 
to see from what we can live.
 
Q: And looking at the Exodus experience, sort
 of as a whole, how did you feel when  you 
were experiencing that as a 
concentration camp survivor?
 
A: Very bad.  Very bad.  
We thought that's it.  We fi
nished in concen tration camp  
because I saw when they burn
ed my--my parents, my brothe
r.  And the other brother two 
weeks before the war was over, th
ey killed him.  Th
ey shoot him.  So I know that's it.
 

Q: But--my question is when --because of wh
at you had experienced in the camp s, when 
you were on the Exodus, did you--how di
d--I mean how did you feel having this 
experience, as a Holocaust survivor, 
after what you had already surv ived ?
 
A: ___+.  But we were 
happy th at we going to a land that 
was going to be ours.  We were 
going to fight for it.
 
Q: Did you think of the British in the same w a
y as you thought of y
our European captors, 
or what were your feelings on--on the British?
 
A: Well, we--we didn't got to know them.  
We--we didn't see nothing.  We didn't know 
about the British.  We didn't
 know--we didn't know, no.
 
Q: Okay.  Are there--are there any other de
tails from that experience and bein g on the 
boat that you can think of 
that we haven't covered?
 
A: No, I don't know.  I really don't know no mo
re.  I don't--I don't.  It
 was--it was terrible, 
a terrible thing.  And even when --when we we
re in Israel already was very hard and--
because we didn't have no hom
es, no nothing.  We had to 
go--not only me, even people 
married.  T h ey didn't  have--you
 know, they liv
ed in other ____ houses
 that they found, 
you know, they find something empty.  
It was very hard.  Very, very hard.
 
Q: When  you went on th
e kibbutz in Israel--
 
A: Yes.
 
Q:--were you assigned your own room or 
bunk or--you know, wh
ere were you living?
 
A: No, no.  We are a few girls in a room.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Any of them from the Exodus?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: So you were really with 
the same group the whole time.
 
A: I had a cousin.  I don't know 
if she's still alive.  She went
 from Brooklyn to Florida to 
live because of children and this.  We were in
 touch not for a long time.  I don 't  know 
now.  I don't--I lost the
--the--lost touch with  her.

Q: What was her name, or what is her name?

bovitz was after her husband.  The first name 
before, I don't know her name.  But Dorry (ph). 
 We call Dorry.  But 
Dora.  That's Dora.
 
Q: Dora Lebovitz.
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And she has two children.  One is a doctor in 
Florida.  Very, very nice people, yes.  It 
was hard.  It was hard.  Then I 
got married.  I wa
s with children.
 
Q: And did you talk ab
out your experience?
 
A: Oh, yeah.  We always used
 to talk about it.  Some pe
ople didn't believe that the 
English did that to us.  Even
 now they don't believe there was an Exodus.  A lot of 
people.  I think so.
 
Q: So you--you--you--actually
--you talked about your specific experience on the Exodus.
 
A: Yes, yes.  A lot.  But, you know, when  
we came--when we came--then right away to 
war.  They got killed.  I knew a boy--we 
were--we were, you know, on the ship, were 
also together talking and th at he died
 the next day wh en  he went to  war.
 
Q: You--you mean in--in Palestine.
 
A: In Palestine.  He was 17 years old.  An
d a lot of--of--a lot of people got killed right 
away.
 
Q: And how--how did you feel
 about that, as a survivor who had already surv ived so 
much, then particip
ating in fighting?
 
A: They said they ha
ve to fight.  They have to fight
 because we suffered so much and 
they killed our--our parents, our
 families.  So we had to fi
ght.  And the Ha
ganah told us, 
it's going to be ours, you know.  So we goi
ng to have a home here
 and we going to live 
here and that's what we felt.  And everybo
dy who didn't go, we wo
rk ed hard, you know.  
Because--the men mostly.  In every kibbutz a
nd in every moshav, they
 went to war.  So 
whoever could went to help
 them, you know.  I didn't
 go because for one purpose 
because they told me I was going to have a ba
by, you know.  So I sa
id ____+ what am I 
going to  do.  So I didn't go.  A lot didn't  go 
away.  Girls, not men.  All the men--all the 
younger boys went.  And a few 
survived.  And we got in touc

you, or what was the situation like?
 
A: No.  No , not really.  No, no.  Maybe ther
e was.  I don't know.  They didn't help me. 
 
Q: Okay.  I think that covers--I'm  trying to th
