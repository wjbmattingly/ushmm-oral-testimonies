T he Germ an Arm y invaded the Netherlands in May
 
1940, bef ore Al was born. 
Imm ediately lif ebecame very dif f icultf or Dutch Jews. Af ter the invasion, the Munzers 

rem ained in their hom e and endured the repressive m easurestakenagainst Jews. On this 

m ap we see the German invasion routes of W estern Europe in 1940.

W ith that, I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our First Person,Al Munzer.
 
>> 
[Applause]
 
>> Bill Benson: It's a nice start. Thank you very m uch. AndAl, thankyou so muchfor your 

wi llingness to spendan hour with us. It'snot
 
a lotof  tim e so we'll try to cover what we can in 
this period.
 
 
Over the pastf ew years you've 
learned
 
m ore and m ore about your fam ily's 
background. Let's start, first, with you telling us about your parentsand their lives to the extent 

that you know about it prior to the riseof  Nazism  andabout its im pact on yourfam ily and 

comm unity bef ore Hitler cam e topower.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W ell, my parents were born inEastern Europe, in apart of the world that at that 
tim e was part of the Austro
-
Hungarian Em pire. 
A n d af t e r  t he  F i r s t W o r l d W ar , i t bec am e p ar t  of  
Poland. My father was born ina sm all town called Kanczuga andm y m other ina neighboring 

town called Rym anow. People have character im ages of the townscalled shtetles
. A
 
m an who 
cam e f rom  m y m other's town 
was Isidor Rabi. Isidor Rabi cam eto the United States, becam ea 
physicist, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1946for the discovery of  

 
3
 
electrom agnetism . Sosom e very f amousand big brains com ingf rom  those little towns.
 
 
Like Isidor Rabi,m y parents decided thatopportunities were justtoo lim it
e
d in those 
sm all towns.T here was also a lotof  anti
-
Semitism . So m y parents decided, when they wer e 
about 18 years old, to leave their parents' hom e.
 
My f ather went directly to the Netherlands 
where he
 
startedam en's clothing business.My m other, instead, went to Berlin where she 
jo in
e
d some older siblings and interestingly, s he arrived in Berlin in the 1920s, just aboutthe 
sam e time thatAdolphHitler's book" Mein Kam pf"  was being publish
e
d. My m other was an 
18
-
year
-
old girl. She wasn't interest
e
d in poli
tics, certainly wasn't interested in reading the 
book. So sheenjoy
e
dher stayf or thef irsttime in a big city.
 
T hen, in December
 
1932 is when 
she joinedm y father in Holland, her childhood sweetheart.And that's when they were m arried.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So they cam e f rom  the same town?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Not thesam e town, neighboring. Very close. About30
 
m iles apart.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You told me that" Allm y ancestors were tailors." W as that true onboth s
i des  of  
the fam ily?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Absolutely. Inf act, there was a story told about thisas partof the lore of my 
m other's hometown.There was anold sage,a Hasidic sage.And he was an orphan.W hat he 

learned
 
--
 
he was apprenticetoa tailoras a very young kid. He saidwhat he learned therewas 
alwa ys m end what is old and never ruin whatis new. So tailoring was ver y much a part of m y 

ancestors.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You also said your grandparents kept very f ew of their possessions in cash, 
furniture or hom es
. W hy was that? 
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W ell, there was a lotof  anti
-
Sem itism  in Poland. So my parents, likem any other 
people, always had tobe on the ready to leave. So that's why they kept their possessions 

really in cash or 
je we lry
 
rather than, you know, in real estate. Something they could take with 
them . AndI think it's probably som ething thatrem ained with m yf amily when they went to 

Berlin, even.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W henwere your two sisters born?T hey were older than you, of  course. When 
were they born?
 

>> A
l Munzer:
 
M y sister Eva was born in July
 
1936. So a very happy occasion, certainly, for 
m y parents, theirf irst child. But interestingly s he was also born just about the sam etim e that 

the infam ous Berlin Olym pics were held which Adolph Hitler turned intoan instrumentof  Nazi 

propaganda. Sohere you have, you know, a very happy occasion inaf am ily in Holland, where 

m y parentsf elt very, very saf e, hadm adem any, m anyf riends, most of  them not Jewish. And 

then justaf ew hundred m ilesaway, in Germany, beginning to seethe real rise of  Nazism .
 
 
My second sister,Leana, was born in November
 
1938.T here, too, it was a 
coincidence because she was bornabouttwo days af ter the Nightof Broken Glass, 

Kristallnacht, in Germ any when thefullf ury o
f a n ti
-
S em it ism  
wa s  
unleashed and hundreds of  
synagogues were burned andthousands of synagogues plundered.So, again, a contrast of a 

happy occasion, celebrationof a birthof a second child, andthese horrible events happening 

just across the border a f ew hundred m iles 
a wa y .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And then, of  course, 10 m onths later, September
 
1,1939, Germ any invades 
Poland, launchingW orld W ar II.T hefollowing May, 1940, Holland, as well as Belgium  and 

Luxem bourg were attacked by Germ any.T ell us what thatm eantfor your f amily and for other 

Jews in Holland both im mediately after the Nazi occupation but inthe months thatfollowed.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W ell, my m other toldm e thatfor thenight of May
 
9, 10, 1940, m y parents had 
been ask
e
d to provideshelter to host a manwho was a
 
m ember of  the Dutch resistance 

 
4
 
m ovement. He hada brief case with him , m ym other toldm e, in which he had plans to 
preem ptively destroy the big railroad center in the city. T he ideabeing thatby destroying that 

railroad center they wo uld slow down any kind of  invasion com ingf rom  Germany.
 
B u t tha t 
m orning, May
 
10, 1940, m y parents and theirguests turnedon the radioandheard thatthe 
port city of  Rotterdam , the largestport city inEurope still today, hadbeen bomb
e
d a nd  
destroyed by Nazi inva ders. Anda
 
f ew m inutes later Queen W ilhelm ina of the Netherlands
 
cam e on the radio andannounce
d  
that Holland had surrendered. She ask
e
d people to 
continue to do their duty wherever they happenedtof ind them selves.
 
 
My parents' guest
,  
this m anf rom  the Dutch resistantm ovement, was thefirst one to 
speakup. He said in Dutch [Speaking Non
-
English Language], "T hank God.It's over." Asfar 
as he was concern
e
d, he had b
een part of the resistance, tried to do what he could to slow 
down any invasion, and now he would just have to try to accom modate to living under an 

occupation.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But that wasn't going to go away. T hey were now here.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
T hat's right. Butf orm y parents now looking at their little kids, they knew. And 
knowing what had happened inGermany and Poland, they knew things were going to get ver y 

rough and that they were going to be basically all alone.
 
 
Alm ost imm ediately, in fact,all sorts of restrictions on Jewish life were put in place. 
Jews had to register all of their property tom ake it easierf or theproperty to eventually be 

conf iscated. Jewish men hadto takea new m iddle nam e, Israel, Jewish women a new m iddle 

name, Sarah, so they could alwa ys be identified as being Jewish.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And that was now part of their legal nam
e.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Absolutely, that becam e partof their legal name.And, of  course,they had to 
register as Jews in addition to that. Andthen there were som e regulations that really m ade 

ver y little sense. Jews were bannedf rom using public transportation,
 
f rom  going into public 
parks; justa way, really, of hum iliating them and setting them  apartf rom  the rest of the 

population.
 
 
Now, when you have a regulation that really m akes very little sense, you tend to 
ignore it. So m y mother toldm e that one day she did go into the park with my little sister's baby 

carriage. Andone day while she was there,aGerm an wom an approached m y mother. So 

scared,her heartalm ost stopped, she toldme, because she wasn'tsupposedtobe there.T he 

wom an looks atthe baby carriage, lookedatm y little sister and saw blond curls, blueeyes, 

and she says, " Ah, you can tell that this is good Germ an Aryan blood" .W ell,my m other had a 

sigh of relief , thanked the wom an, and, of  course, lef ttheparknever to comebackthere.
 
>> B ill 
Benson:
 
You mention
e
dAryan. Som ething I read that you had written, you wrote 
M
arch 
12,1941,all Jewish property is Aryanized.W hatdid youm ean by that?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
It m eant basically that while people could still holdonto their
 
possessions, 
le ga ll y 
it now becamepart of the Germ an state. So whatever would happentothem  in the 
future, this was really
 
--
 
it would be conf iscated, would belong totheGerm an state.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Several m onthsbefore you were born your parentsenroll
e
dEva in a Catholi
c 
school.W hy didthey do that?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
T his was their attem pt, really, at hiding her Jewish identity. And then shortly 
thereafterm y little sister Leana was also enrolled ina Catholic school. It's really a wa y of 

assum ing a new Catholic identity andhiding their Jewish one.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Plus Jews were bannedfrom going to school.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Jews at thattim e also were bannedf rom  going topublic schools.It was one 

 
5
 
option opento them .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You were born Novem ber
 
24, 1941
 
--
 
pardon?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
23.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
23. Excusem e.Almost 19 months af ter the Nazi's occupation of Holland.Your 
parents joyf ul, having the birth of a son,but in them idst of  such circumstances ithad to have 
been accompanied byprofoundfear. Do
 
you know 
anything about their thoughts?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Absolutely. T his is som ethingm y m other would tellm em any, m any tim es. 
W hen shefound out that she was pregnant again with m e during the occupation, and thiswas 

an unplanned pregnancy, she toldm e, she went to
 
see her obstetrician. T hism ust have been 
early 1941.And herobstetrician told her in no uncertain term s that she ought to have an 

abortion. Hetoldher it would be imm oral tobring another Jewish lif einto the world.
 
 
Now, m y m other wasn't particularly religious at that tim e but shedid turn tothe Bible 
for advice. She read the story of  a woman called Hannah. Hannah, youm ight remember, 

would go to the temple every year and pray that she m ighthave a child, that she m ight 

conceive. And it was in reading
 
of Hannah'sagonizin g desire tohave a child thatm y m other 
decide
d she could notpossibly not have the pregnancy. Her obstetricianf iredher as apatient. 
So ninem onths later I was born athom e with thehelp of a nurse.
 
 
And that brought about anotherdilemm a in Jewish lif e because typically and 
traditionally Jewish m ale boys, Jewish m ale children,are circum cised when they are 8days 

o ld
. T
his goes all the way back to the Bible. My parents'f riends told them, said don't have him  
c irc u m c is e d , it  will id e
ntif y him as being Jewish. And this time theanswer to their dilem ma 
cam e in theform of aworr ied look on theface of a pediatrician who had justexam ined me. My 

father turned to him  and said, ﬁIs
 
there anything wrong with thebaby?
ﬂ 
T hen the pediatrician
 
said, 
ﬁN
o, it's just thatyour little boy needs am inoroperationthat we call a circum cision.
ﬂ 
So  
m y f ather told him  of  our Jewish tradition and eight
 
days later we had that ceremony, probably 
the last oneheld like that inThe Hague in Holland, inm y ho
metown, where the whole family 

gathered in the living r oom to celebrate thism ilestone,f irst m ilestone in a Jewish life.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And likely, as you just said, the lastone that tookplace during the war.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Yes. It's a very special m emory to m e. I don't remember the event.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. [Laughter]
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
T here were som ephotographs taken. And they're very sm all, about1
-
by
-
1.5 in 
size showin g the whole fam ily aroundthe table, me on the pillow.
 
W hat is very special about 
these photographs is thatm y m other
 
kept them  hidden on her body through her subsequent 
stay in 12 concentration cam ps.She developed thisf eeling, this superstition, that if  she ever 

lost thosephotographs it would m eanthat Ihad been killed. Fortunately she hung on to them . 

Andfortunately m y m other survived, the photograph survived, and Isurvi ved. Of course the 

photos were so valuable that Ididnot wanttokeepthem  in the house and they are now part of  

the collection of  th
e Holocaust Museum .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Al, over the next 10m onths after your birth, November
 
23, 1941, by 
September
 
1942, conditions had becom e som uch worse and yourparents made the decision 
thatthef am ily needed to go into hiding if  youwere to have a chance to survive.W hat 

convinced your parents m emust do that? And what didthey do?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W ell, this was at a tim e whenm any men, includingm y f ather, were getting 
notices to report for so
-
called labor duty
, l
abor duty in a concentration cam p, in H
o lla nd  s t ill.  
But knowing f ull well that that couldm eanbeing sent,as they said, to the east, to Poland, to 

cam ps that were, of course, m uch, much worse. So this was really a signal to Jewishf am ilies 

 
6
 
to go into hiding.
 
 
Onefam ily, Anne Fran
k ' s  f a m ily,  
f or example, decided to hide as aunit. My parents 
m ade the very diff icult decisionthat asaf orm of  insurance tom akesure that if one personwas 
taken, at least anotherone m ight survive, that thefam ily would be split up and we would hide 

in diff erent 
places.
 
Sothef irst oneto go into hiding was m y f ather. He pretendedto comm itan 
act of suicide.T hat gainedhim adm issiontoa psychiatric hospital.So he hid there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As a patient.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
As a patient. Andthen m y two sisters 
we re
 
the next to be p
laced.
 
A very devout 
Catholic wom an told her priest that shehad a dream  in which the Virgin told herto take Jewish 

children into hiding. The priest then contact
e
d m y parents' neighbors. They contactedm y 
parents. And so m y two sisters were entrusted tothat wom an and herf am ily.
 
 
My m other was lef t with me. Shetoldm e that was a particularly diff icult timef orher, 
to be all alone in the house with one little child. She was always af raid that thedoorbell m ight 

r i n g 
and a Nazi off icer m ight com ethroughthe door. So she dampend the clapperof  the 
doorbell with a cloth so it wouldn'tm ake a noise.T hen she toldm e she would spend the whole 

night sitting onthe steps watching to see if  the cla
pper
 
would move.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I was going to ask you, after yourf atherhad gone into the psychiatric hospital, 
your m other handled the location, the hidings of  your sisters,how did your m other cope wit h 

th a t im
m ense responsibility by herself ? Probably not really sure where everybody was at that 
poi
nt because they're in hiding
, w
hat was that likef or her? You gave us ahintof  that with the 
anxiety.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
It really shows, also, the strength of m y mother's character. She certainl
y  wa s n't  
alone in having to do that.Som any Jewish fam ilies hadtodo theexact sam ething. It was a 

terrible, terribledecisionf orm y m other. Andthat's why she described thisanxiety to m e of  

being lef talone with me. And then shef inally hadtof inda placef orm e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Righ t .
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
So Jewi sh mal
e children were m ore diff icult to place.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
For the reasons you justdescribedf orus.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Right, couldbe identified as being Jewish. Sof inally,  m y m other's neighbor, a 
wom an acrossthe street, Annie Magna, agreed to takem e.She had had som e bad run
-
i ns  
with the Nazi occupiers so she got scared and passedm e on tohersister. Then it turned out 

thatthe sister hada neighbor who was a m em berof  the Dutch Nazi Party. Hollandhad the 

second largest party in Europe, second only to Germ any. So she got scared. She was af raid 

hem ight hear me cry. So she passed me back to Annie. And thenf inally Annie passed me on 

to  
her ex
-
husband.She was divorc
ed. 
 
 
Her form erhusband was a m an who was born in Indonesia. He was an Indonesian 
m an. He ag
reed to take me in.
 
He hada nanny who had taken care of  the three M
agna 
children. He had partial custody, joint custody, of  those three children as well. And she is the 

one, Mim a, thisnanny who really now became m y mother. And that's how I ended upbeing
 
placed with the Madna fam ily.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W e™ r e 
going to turnback to your time with the Madnaf am ily. So now your 
m otherfound a placefor you and she is now on her own.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
At this point she closes ourhousefor the last tim e and she joins
 
m y father in 
that same psychiatric hospital, in her casepretending to be anurse.So that became herhiding 

place,notf or a very lo ng tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Did the people inthe psychiatric institution
 
--
 
did they believe your father was a 

 
7
 
patient, a re
alpatient,or were people in on it? And did your m otheracknowledge a relationship 
with your father or did they have to keepthat
 
--
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
I think they hadto keep that secret.T hey really had to stay apart. Althoughmy 
m other did tell m e that on 
Christm as day 1942, som ehow m y two litt le sisters were brought 
therefor a visit. This was som ething ver y dar
in g. T ha t wa s the  la sttim e
 
when youhad a sm all 
reunion, really, of  the Munzer f am ily, in thatpsychiatric hospital. There were m any Jewish 

patien
ts hiding in that sam e hospital.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Your mother later, I think, shared with you some thoughts about that time and 
what that was like to be in thatpsychiatric hospital. Anything you can share with us?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Yes. She told me that, you know, looking
 
--
 
she had never com e across or been 
invol ved or meeting people with a severem ental illness.And rem em ber, this isa time before 

there were medications to treat severem ental illness. So she was in contact, she saw people 

who were ver y, ver y differentf rom anybody she had ever metbef ore, with very strange 

behaviors, wearing, yo u know, clothes that were totally out off ashion. And yet, you know, she 

said looking at thosepeople in the hospital she really wondered whether where them ental 

illn e
ss wa s. W as it  
in the hospitalor was it inthe world outside?W as the world outside really 
m uch more sick than thesepeople?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As you just shared with us afew m omentsago, yousaid your sisters 
apparently were able to go Christm as 1942, right af ter Christm as1942 your parents were 

taken by theSS.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
T h at's co rre ct. On Ne w Y
ear's 
D
ay, 1942, the hospital, the psychiatric hospital 
was em ptied of all pati
ents and staff. And a
l l  of  t he  pa t i en t s  we r e  s ent to 
a concentration cam p, 
to  W e
sterbork, a transit camp,as it's called, in the northernm ost part of  Holland.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Patients and staff.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Patients and staff. My parents rem ained inW esterbork for several months.My 
m other took care of children who had been sent to that cam p. It gave her a good feeling 

realizing that her own children were saf e whil e she was tryin g to provide care to these very 

unf ortunate children who weren't safe, who were in thef irst concentration camp.
 
 
Af ter af ew m onths, m y parents were transpo
rted f rom W esterbork to another camp 
in Holland, this tim e in the southernm ostpartof  Holland.T here they were assigned todo slave 

laborf orthe Philipselectronicsf actory. And that's where m y mother learned working on 

electronics was onemore type of work that was essential to the Germ an war effort andm ight 

save her life, though she hadm any otheroccupations inbetween.
 
 
Andm y m other toldme that while she was in that concentration cam p, there was a 
lineupof  all theprisoners every m orning. And one day they were address
e
d by a very high 
off icer in the Nazi regim e and that was Heinrich Himm ler, Hitler's second in com mand. She told 

m ethat Himm ler exhorted theprisoners to continue to work f or theReich an
d that as long as 
they continued working for the success of theReich, nothing bad would ever happen to them .
 
Andm y m other toldme that while she was listening to Him m ler, she saw the spireof  a small 

Dutch church way off  in the distance. And she saidtoherself  it would be so wonderful if  peace 

were 
to breakoutatthatm om ent and she could just run to that church,f allonher knees,and 
thank Godf orhaving been freed,f orhaving been liberated. Shedidn't care whether it was a 

church, a m osque or a synagogue, just a place to thank God.
 
 
Sadly, of  course,thatwasn't to be. Himm lerdid not keephis prom ise. And just about 
threem onths later that camp, too, was em pt
ie
d and all of  the prisoners, including m y parents, 
were sent toAuschwitz. And that's where they were separated.That's the last tim em y p

saw each other.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W henthey arrived in Auschwi tz.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W hen they arri ved in Auschwit z.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Now, although your mother hid with you theneighbor, theneighbor, you told 
us, eventually arranged f or you to endup with the Madnafam ily. T ell us aboutthef am ily and 
what your lif e was like with them . You're a little boy and living with this Indonesianf am ily.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
First of all, I was notaware atall that I looked any different than the rest of the 
fam ily. They were dark
-
skinned.They were, you know, Indonesian.So that was thef irst thing. I 
re a lly f e lt  th is  wa s  m y f a m ily.
 
 
Mim a was an incredible wom an. She was illiterate, couldn't reador write, did not 
speakthe Dutch language only theIndonesian language,but she had aheart of  gold. She 

really treatedm eas her own child. She would walk m iles every day j ust to get m ilkfor me. 

Ever ything was rationed, so youhad to have ration couponsto getmilk. Since I was in the 

home illegally, you couldn't get ration.So 
she had to scrounge around f or m ilk.
 
 
Inf act, af ew years ago when I was in Holland, a woman wag
ge
d her f inger at m e. 
She said, 
ﬁY
ou know, you usedtodrink m y m ilk.
ﬂ 
I sa id , 
ﬁW
hat do you mean by that?
ﬂ 
S he  
said,
 
ﬁW
ell, you know,all children in Hollandduring the war years were given a smallbottle of  
m ilk in school andm y m other toldm e to save half of  that little bottlefor the baby next door. 

And you were the baby next door.
ﬂ 
Sohere you have it, you know a child 8,9,10 years old 
already participating in saving a human life. A story I really love.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How old was Mim a at that time?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Probably in her late20s,early 30s. I'm not really sure. Probably
 
--
 
actually, 
probably m id
-
30s because she hadtaken care of the Madna children,
 
the three Madna 
children,earlier, in fact 10 years earlier. So I'm  not sure.T here's very, ver y little known about 

her.
 
I'm  told thatI slept in her bed and that she kept a knif eunder her pillow vo wing to kill 
anyone Nazi who m ight try to come and get m
e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So, Al,here you are, this very young, Caucasian child living in an Indonesian 
f a m ily in  Na zi
-
occupied Holland. How did the Madnaf am ily explain your presence?To 
outsiders, som ebody wouldbe curious. How did they explain that? Do you kn
ow?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
First of all, the house really was searched several times while I was there. I 
rem em ber having to hide inthe small cellar.All I remember about it was playing with the 

Christm asdecorationsthere were stored there. One of thosem emories 
t h at
™
s very clear to m e.
 
But Papa Madna, what I called himf or the rest of his life, would tell the Nazis that I was the 

ille git im a t e  c h ild  of  h is  e x
-
wif e and that shenow had anew boyf riend who did not wantm e 
around. Andthat's how he explainedm y presence. One of several stories he made up.
 
 
Much later
 
--
 
this was towards really the endof  the war, when he wasn'tfeeling so 
scared, tookme out of the house andpeoplewould sort of  look at him  and see the child and 

would ask him, 
W
ho isthis baby? And he
 
s a i d,  
ﬁW
ell, that'sm y son.
ﬂ 
And then is 
s a i d,
 
you 
know, he tookpleasure in watching people'sreactions, people shaking their headsas they said 

this stupid Indonesian man doesn't even know that his wif e is sleeping around.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Al Munzer:
 T
his is the kind of sense of hum or he had. A wonderful, wonderf ulm an.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You had mention
e
d, of course, the neighbor that came up to you recently and 
said you had some ofour m ilk. Did others in the comm unity
 
know who you were?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Th
e Indonesian comm unity was ver y m uchaware of m y presence in thehouse 
becausem any years l ater, for exam ple, when I cam e to visit PapaMadna, af ter Ihad moved to 

 
9
 
the UnitedStates, wewent to an Indonesiangrocery store and them an behind the counter 
im m
ediately said, " Bobbie
ﬂ 
--
 
Bobbie, by thewa y, was m y name while in hiding with the Madna 
fam ily, Bobbie.Andf or m any, m any years, thef am ily, in addition to three children, there was 

also a little dog inthefam ily. AndI always thought that I was called
 
Bobbie after the littledog. 
T he reasonbeing if  people heard Bobbiebeing called, they would think, well, they're just 

calling the littledog. And just afew years ago I told this toone of my foster sisters. She'snow 

8 7  ye a rs  o ld , s t ill livin g  in  Ho lla
nd. And I toldher this story and shesaid,
 
ﬁO
h, no, no, you're 
absolutely wrong. T he dog's nam e wasn't Bobby. T he dog's nam ewas 
T
eddy.
ﬂ 
So there went 
that whole theory.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
So in actualfact, I was probably called Bobbie because 
the  th ird
 
--
 
the boy in 
the Madnaf am ily was called Robbie.And soRobbieand Bobbiebeing so close, sam e theory, 

oh, just calling Robbie. That'sprobably wh y I was gi ven that name.
 
 
I was not allowed outof the house. Theonly view I had of the outside world was 
looking througham ail slot.T here were af ew neighbor children whowere allowed to comeand 

play with m e. And the reason is that
 
--
 
that they were trust
e
d was that they were Germ an but 
they were Germ an
 
--
 
theirf am ily was Com munist. So they had escapedf rom  Germ any into 
Holland because they alsof earedAdolph Hitler. And because they were Comm unists, they 

were trusted by the Madna fam ily to come and play with m e.Butother than that I had really 

ver y, very l ittle contactwith the outside world.
 
 
Yo
u know, I have very,  ver y f ew m em oriesof thatperiod. One thing I do rem ember, 
andthism usthave been very late in m y stay with the Madnafam ily, when there was a 

trem endous shortageoff ood in Holland
 
I rem em ber being very hungry. And theonly thing we 
had really lef ttoeat, I'm told, was ground
-
uptulip bulbs. I remember seeing the table setfor a 
m eal, during the night,and getting upoutof bed and sitting down at the table thinking thatI 

was going to bef ed. And I fell asleep with m y headfalling on the plate. Andthat's how they 

foundm e in the morning. T hat's also one of the memories that I have.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Al, asyou told us earlier, before your m otherfoundthehiding placef or you, 
she hadfounda hiding placefor Eva and Leana with a Cath
o lic f am ily.  T ra gic a ll y in  

February
 
1944, your sisters were taken by the SS. Can y
ou tell us about that? 
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Yes.W ell, I was ver y saf e and happy, you know, with  the Madnaf am ily. T he 
story of m y sisters' was totally diff erent.There the husband
 
of  the wom an who had taken in m y 
sisters denounced his own wif e to the Nazis as hiding two Jewish children.So the Nazis took 

his wif e. She was im prisoned, eventually f reed, butm y two sisters were immediately takento 

W esterbork andthen im mediately sent
 
off toAuschwitz where they were killed in 
February
 
1944.T hey were only 6 and 8 years old. So I really never knew m y sisters.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you have any other photographs of them  besidestheone we saw earlier ?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Yes. I actually have m any, many photographs m y mother used to keepthrows 
in a box. I call thatm y fam ily in a box. And gradually she would tellme storiesand bring the 

stories alive.
 
 
You know, we'll talk about how I was reunited with m y m other but it tookmea long 
tim e to come to understand what had happened to m y sisters after the war. My m other's 

neighbors would show m e notebooks thatm y sister Eva had written in when she was only 6 

years old. She had this beautif ulhandwriting. And I would really be jealous of m y two little
 

sisters becauseI hadno com prehension, nounderstanding of  whathadhappened tothem. 

And then very gradually I cam eto understand that there were somepeople who didnot com e 

 
10
 
back
 
--
 
that's the term people used.Som epeople came back andothers didnot 
com e back. 
And somehow m y 
s
isters had gonetoa place where they didnot com e backf rom.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The war ended in Europe in May
 
1945. Yourm other returned in August.Tell us 
how your m other survi ved andhow shem ade it back and what your reuniting with your m other 
was like f or you as best you know.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W e lef tm y m other when shewas in Auschwitz. She went onf rom  Auschwitz to 
another concentration cam p where she continued to do work
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As a slave laborer.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
A s a
 
slave laborerf orT elefunken. Sheassem bled radio tubes. My m otherthere 
began to take real pleasure in thefact that she worked alongsideGerm an soldiers who had 

been repatriate
d 
f rom  thef ront andhad been severely injured so they were no longer usef ul 
on 
thebattlef ield. They had become so anti
-
Hit le r 
thatthey dideverything to sabotage the 
workin gs of  the f actory.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
F o rme r G e rma n
 
--
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Germ an soldiers. Som y m other, you know, as a result started her own littleacts 
of  s ab o ta ge
. She toldm e she would spend all day assembling one radio tube, which was the 
work that she was doing there, andat theend of  theday she woulddisassemblethe radio 

tube, put it in adrawer, and then start the process all over again thefollowing day. 
 
 
She witnes
se
d the bom bing by the allies of thatfactory. And she said a prayer of 
thanks in Hebrew when she saw thatthef actory was going up inf lam es.It wasn't theendof  

her ordeal because she was then put on a Death March, gradually back towards Germ
any,  
andthenf inally she was liberated at the German
-
Dutchborder through the interventionof  the 
head of the Swedish Red Cross.
 
So then shewas sent onfrom  there to Sweden to recuperate. 
Andf inally in August
 
1945 is when she returned to Holland and that's when I was reunitedwith 
m y m other.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you rem em ber that?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
T hat is thef irst really clear m em ory thatI have. I remem ber being asleep in one 
of  the room s in the back of thehouse and Devi Madna com ing to wake me and then ca
rr
ie
d 
m e into the living room. I was cryin g, cranky, because I didnot want
 
--
 
I was awakened. She 
carried me into the living room  where the wholef am ily was sitting in  a circle.T hey did what you 

do with a crying child. T hey pass
e
d mef rom  lap to lap. I rem em ber that there was one lap I 
wouldn't sit in,a wom an I keptpushing away. And that was m y own m other. She was a 

com plete stranger to me. And I already had am other andthat was Mim a Sai
n a. S o a tth at 
point m y m other 
decided that Mim a Saina would continue to carefor m e while she,m y m other, 

went out lookingf or work.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yourf ather.T ellus what happened to your father.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W ell, my f ather remained inAuschwitz f or about six m onths.Infact, just afew 
m onthsago here atthe museum If ound in the archives a little slip of paper with his num ber as 

a prisoner. And it said in 
ﬁ
German prem ium  em ployee.
ﬂ 
AndI hadno idea what that m eant so I 
askedthe researcher here atthe museum  what thatm eant. And hesaid itm eant that the 

wages of  the slave laborers had to be paid by thefactories em ploying themtothe Nazis, to the 

SS, andthat yourf ather som ehow warrant
e
da higher salary.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
To bepaid to the Nazis.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
T obepaid to the Nazis which shows this whole burea
u cra t ic syst e m t ha t  wa s 
put in place justto persecute people.
 
 
My f ather, as I said, rem ained in Auschwit z f or six m onths;then was sent on to three 

 
11
 
cam ps in Austria: Mauthausen,Gusen, Styr. Andhedid slave laboragain under terrible 
conditions assembling V2 rock
et s  i n  
abandon
e
d salt m ines.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
At theendof  the war.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
T his was really at the very end of  the war. He survive d to see liberation by the 
Am erican Arm y in May
 
1945 buthe was so weak that hediedtwo months later.I never
 
go t to  
m eet him . He was buried inthe concentration camp, theEbensee concentration camp
, 
which 
is now a cemetery.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you've been there, right?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
I've been there. It's really oneof  them ostbeautiful places inthe world. I'm  
sure 
thatm any of  you have seen the movie " Sound of  
M
usic." W ell, that's where it was f ilm ed. 
Am idst all of thisbeauty, natural beauty, you hadthis terrible concentration cam p. Infact, there 

was Edelweiss growing on m yf ather's grave. Too diff icult to understandhow people can go so 

low as what happenedduring the Holocaust. It's really incredible.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You have som ething of  your father's with you today. Don't you? 
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Yes. I don't
 
--
 
asI said, Inever knew m y father. I never had a
 
chance to meet 
with him . I have afew l ittle possessionsof him  thatI've really, reall y
 
--
 
cling to. And one of 
them  is thisfountain pen. My m other encouraged me to take thisf ountain pen with me 

whenever I hada diff icult exam  to take,for exam ple, adm
ission to medical school, or when I 
sign im portant docum ents. T hefact thatthiswas held by m y father, you know, is something 

ver y, very, ver y m eaningf ul to m e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ith your mother back, Al, after she lef tSweden and returnedand was 
reunited
 
with you, when did she learnabout the lossof her daughters, of her husband? She 
was a ver y strong wom an,as you said earlier. How did she to your best knowledge, adjustto 

the extraordinary losses she experienced?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
I still don't know to this day. My m other told m e that she realize
d 
people did not 
w
ant to see tears. So she suppre
ss
ed
 
tears so hard that she would,you know, hold her hand 
ver y tight and she actually developed an infection on her hand just to suppress any tears.
 
I n it ia lly t h e  t h
ought was, as I said,that Mim awould continue to takecare of me but then, sadly, 
Mim a passedaway t wo months later. So m ym other was really lef tall alone with m eat that 

point.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And aprof ound lossf or you.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Another prof ound loss for me. Inf act, Ihave very, ver y f ew m em ories of Mima. 
Oneof  the very f ew mem ories I have of  Mima is that she usedto sing a lullaby tom e. And a 

few years ago I told astory, just like I'm telling it to you
, 
to a group of Indonesian students 
vis it
in g the United States to learnabout religious pluralism . Indonesia is apredom inantly 
Muslim  country. And I told the story. And at the very end I told the students, you know, I have 

ver y, very f ew m emories of  Mim a. Mim a, who, by the way, was Muslim . And a
l l  I re me mbe r 

about her is she used to sing a lullaby tome and it was called Nina Bobo. And all 25 students 

started singing it in unison. It brought tears to m y eyes. It was 
an 
incredibly powerf ul m om ent. 
Andaf terthat, youngwom en in the group wi th head
 
scarves, traditional Muslim wom en, cam e
 
up to me,hugged me,and said, you know, we arefam ily. And I think that really containeda 

ver y, very im portant lesson to me,a lesson Ithink thatthe world needs to hear.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you're doing all you can to help share that lesson.
 
 
Bef ore we close and have a chanceto turn to our audience,there were many m ore 
changes aheadfor you. You and your motherm oved to Belgium  in1952. And in1958 you 

were able to imm igrate to the UnitedStates.W hat were those adjustm ents likefor you? 
 

 
12
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W ell, you know,f irst of all, I grew up in apost Holocaust era. Ialready 
m entionedhow diff icult it was f orm e to cometo understand what it happened to m y sisters. To 
m e, you know, playing in a field of rubble 
was the m ost
 
--
 
the city of The Haguehad been 
bombed and largely destroy
e
d. It was the most norm al thing. Playing hide and seek inbunkers 
was the most normal thing. So I hadm any adjustments tomake over tim e. So I think that 

preparedm e well for eventually com ing to the UnitedStates where Ihadto learn English, of 

course,attendhigh school,totally diff erent school than the one I had been accustom
e
d to.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I think you told m e
 
--
 
it m ad e m e  ch u c k le a  I  will lit t le  b it
 
--
 
when you cam e 
here
, the kids called you " French
ie
."
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Right. In fact,many years later when I went toa reunion
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Not Belgian but Frenchie
. 
>> Al Munzer:
 
T hat's right.W henI cam etoareunion, som eof m y fellow students pointed to 
m e and said "
T he French kid."T hat's how they rem em ber
e
dme. Som any adjustments. And 
even m ore diff icult, of course,for m y mother. And shehad to go towork, com e to the United 

S ta te s.
 

 
But com ing to the United States was really very im portant. It was awa y for her t
o 
break away, really m ake a complete break wit h all the badm em ories of  all thethings thathad 

happened in Holland and, of course, in the concentration camps and really begin to really 

begin life anew, which she was abletodo in the United States. Andshe lived well into her90s, 

eventually m oved here to W ashington, started painting again, which she had doneas a young 

wom an, and really, yo u know, I think hada good life in theend.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Al, didany otherm em bers of your extend
e
d  f a m i l y s u r vi ve
?  
>> Al Munzer:
 
T he only person who survived was a brotherof m y mother's. He was oneof the 
siblings m y m other had been with in Berlin. And he andhis wif e and young sonm anaged to 

get a visa to Bolivia, just aboutthe time of Kristallnacht, Night of Broken Glass. So to this day I 

still have some relatives living in Bolivia, oneof  the poorest countries in the world. Som eof 

them  have m igrated, you know, to Chile but Istill have fam ily there.Not all that long ago we 

celebrateda wedding of  one of my uncle's great grandchildren.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In Bolivia?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
In Bolivi a.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I thinkwe have tim efor a couple of questionsf rom  our audience.W hy don't 
we
 
--
 
are you upf or that?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
Absolutely. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I'd liketo ask
 
youto stay with us during the questionperiodover the next few 
m inutes because we're going to conclude with some closing rem arks f rom Al.
 
W e have 
m icrophones in both aisles.W e askthat youwait until you have amicrophone in your hand. 

T he y will h e lp  i
dentif yyou because we have diff iculty actually seeing you with the lights. So 

we'll tr y to spot hands as best we can.
 
I will r epeat the question asbest I can just tom ake sure 
thatAl and allof  us, actually, hear itbefore he responds to it.
 
 
Is th e re
 -- 
there we go.
 
>>
 
Hi. Fantastic story.First of all, how old wer e you when your m other started telling you her 
story? Anddid she volunteer it ordid you have toencourage it? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hatwas last part?
 
>>
 
Did she volunteerher story or did you have toencourages her telling the story.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hendid your m om begin telling you what happened, her story andall about 
your f am ily and did you have to encourageher to do that? 
 

 
13
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W ell, itwas a ver y gradual process. AsI saidbefo
re, the f irst thing, learning 
aboutm y sisters and learning about m yf ather. Andthen, you know, beginning to go through all 
thephotographsof  the fam ily. T hat started, you know, at a very you ng age actually. T hen,you 

know, I heard little bits and pieces
. And then af ter the Holocausttelevision series inthe early 
1960s is when Idecided that I really needed to know the whole story, that it was ver y im portant 

for me to know.
 
SoI sat down with m y m other and am ap and I asked her to tell me exactly 
what hadhappened. And what concentrationcam ps she had been in at whattime. And that's 

when I began to reconstruct the whole story.Shedid that really volu ntarily. And Ithink it really 

helped her also, tohave som eoneto share the story with.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ehave one right here and thenone in thef ront.W e're going to get a 
m icrophone down to you. It's com ing down on this side.T here yougo.
 
>>
 
Ho w old were you when you came to theU.S. and which partof the U.S. did you live in and 
m ove to?
 

>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
How old were you when you came tothe U.S.and where did you move to?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
W ell, we cam e to United States in 1958. It really took a very long tim e actually 
to get a visa to the United States.W e really di d not have any close relatives here.
 
>> B
ill Benson:
 
So she had beentrying f or awhile.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
T rying f or a while, yes. Oh, where.W e arrived in New York City.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You were 17?
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
I was about16,17 years old.W earrived in Brooklyn. And the people we sta
ye
d 
wi t h  wa
s a wom an who had been imprisoned with m y m other, who went through all the same 
concentration cam ps.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
E igh t of  th em  I th in k.
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
And that's where they really bond
e
d.T his wom an also told me som e am azing 
stories of  what it was likefor these wom en in the concentration camps and the kinds of things 

that kept them alive. So in her case this woman's case, Hella, she som ehow m anaged to 

sm uggle a 
co rse t 
i n t o th e  c am p.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A 
corset
? 
>> Al Munzer:
 
A 
co rse t
. And the wom en would take turns wearing that 
co rse t
. And it was sort 
of  their way of  continuing to believe thatthere was a world outsideof the camps a really f unny 

type of  thing. Just in the way
 
--
 
a totally diff erent way f rom  the way m y m other held on to the 
photographs which kept her alive, she told me.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I hadn't heard thatbefore. T hank you.
 
 
W ehave a question inthe f ront row. Here com es yourm ic.W e will be able to hear

Mi m a ' s
, 
and Mima being

>> Bill Benson:

e
d 
education, when did you begin
 
--
 
and couldn'tgo to school,obviously
 
---

en did youbegin to

>> Al Munzer:
 
W ell,f ortunately there were three other children,the three Mad
na
 
children in the 
household. One of them em ories I have is when they were trying to do
 
--
 
they were doing their 
homework. So Itook apen and started scribbling, im itating them. And they all started laughing 

because obviously it was just scribbles, you know. I was 3 years old. ButI do remem berbeing 

ver y, very angr y because they w
ere laughing at m e. But I really learned Dutch through them . 
Althoughm y real native tongue initially was the Indonesian language. I retained very, ver y few 

 
14
 
words that I rem ember. Very few.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W e'regoing to end the program  in justam om ent.W
hen A l  f in i s hes  t h e 
program , we'd like to invite you tof eel absolutely f reeto come up on the stage after the 
program  andask another question. If you have a questionand didn't get toask it.Or just say hi 

to Al, shake his hand, get your picture takenwith him . Pleasefeelf ree to do that.
 
 
Unfortunately there's so muchm ore Al couldshare with us.Andone of  the things, 
just to give you a hint at, asa resultof his speaking anddoing other things related tothe 

Holocaust, he becam eacquainted with people in Indonesia with a unique story about this 

Indonesianf am ily. And subsequently over the last several years you've been broughtto 

Indonesia several tim es. And adocumentary is beingf inish
e
d right now abouthis story and 
this Indonesianfam ily. So there's been a remarkable connection wit h that country in the last 

few years.
 
 
It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t P e rs on
 
that our First Person gets the last word. So I will turn 
it over to Al to close it. Bef ore he does, I want to thank youf or beingwith us. I rem ind you we 
wi ll have a
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program eachW ednesday andT hursday until August
 
10.So if you 
have the opportunity to come back, please do. Them useum 's website will have inf ormation 
about our program  in 2018.
 
 
So with that, Al? 
 
>> Al Munzer:
 
I th in k t
he greatest tragedy ofthe Holocaust, to me,wasn't even the loss of six 
m illion people or even the loss of m y sisters andm y f ather. It was thef act that it was not the 

last genocide. As I told you, afew years ago I m et a youngm an who as a10
-
year
-
old, 
was a 
prisoner in C
ambodia. And he and I have bonded a
s being commonsurvi vors of  genocide.But 
thepositive thing that I learned and them essage that I really want to leave with you, that even 

in a sea of hate it is possible todothe right thing. It is possible like Papa Madna and Mima 

Sainato stand up to hateeven when you'resurroundedby evil and to do the right thing. And 

that's what they did.It's a trem endous power that we, every hum anbeing, has. I thinkthat 

that's really a thought I hope people would take with them  asthey leave today.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you.
