Question:  This is the United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum interview with 
Mr. Rubin Pizem, conducted by 
Casey Bayless (ph) on Decembe
r 16, 2011, in New York  
City.   And again, good morning, Mr. Pizem, 
we're delighted to have
 you. Can you first 
tell me when and wh ere you were born?  
 
Answer:  I was born Novemb er 29, '30, in Primishlana.  
 
Q: And where is that lo
cated, where at the time? 
 
A: Presently, it's  located
 in the Ukraine.  Before the war,
 it was a P o lish city, belonged to 
Poland.
 
Q: And can you tell me about your life growing 
up there?  Can you de
scribe your parents, 
to begin?
 
A: My life was a very pleasant life.  I grew up 
in a very  bourgeois family, to say.  We live 
comfortable, until the war started.
 
Q: What did your parents do as a profession?
 
A: They had real estate, land.  They were 
welloff.  My father didn 't work.  He was a 
religiousoriented man; he was 
a rabbi but he never practiced.
  So, this was my home.  I 
had a sister, Esther, and I have a sister, Ida Bi
esenkarcher (ph).  She'
s alive.  I survived 
the war with my sister and my mother.
 
Q: What languages did you speak at home?
 
A: At home?  Polish, Yiddish, comb ination of both. 
 
Q: And was your home a lively environment?
 
A: Oh, yes.
 
Q: Did your parents have friends over? 
 
A: Oh, yes.
 
Q: And what did they do?
 
A: We lived in a big house, a lot of friends. 
 I was a child so I was not familiar with their 
social life, but yes, people used  to come to us
.  Very often my parents took me with them 
up to some neighbors, friends, relatives.  Y
ou know, typical Jewish life in the prewar 
shtatle, I w ould say it is.
 
Q: So you had relatives in the area?
 
A: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.
  I have two uncles in the city
, I have distant relatives there, 
had an aunt in another city, but not far.  The city was Gleanyani (ph).  Sometimes we 

went to visit them, they came to visit us.  Wh
at can I tell?  I have
 a very happy childhood 
until the war.  I had frie
nds, we play, you know.
 
Q: And did you go to school?
 
A: Yes.  I went to a Polish school and starte
d the first grade, then the war started, so I 
wentthe Russians came.  Fortunat
ely, theyotherwise the Germans would be there in '39.  
Later, I went to Ukrainian school.
 
Q: Uhu.  And it was a shtatle school?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Not a Jewish school.
 
A: No, no, no, no, no.
 
Q: And there were boys and girls in your school?
 
A: Yes, yes.
 
Q: And were they treated differently in 
terms of expectations of work  or home 
responsib ilities?
 
A: No.  It was just ano, no.  What
 do you mean by treating differently?
 
Q: Were boys expected to work  and girls expected to be home?
 
A: No, no, no.  No , no, this is notthis is your
th is is probably those mo re religious houses.  
No, we were a traditi
onal home.  So, no, no.
 
Q: Did you have nonJewish friends?
 
A: Yes, a lot of them.  It was a very good, pl
easant life.  Of course, later I would thinkbut 
we will come to it.
 
Q: We will.  And you sp okeyou mentioned your two sisters.
 
A: Uhu.
 
Q: Can you describe them a little bit 
more?  Were they older or younger?
 
A: Oh, yes, Esther was older.  She was alr
eady graduated from the gymnasium.  And Ida, 
my sister , was younger. 
 They have a lot of friends.  I mean by "they," I mean my  older 

sister.  She used to take me out, certain concerts
 in the city.  I would sa
y a rich social life.  
 
I didn 't notice that my childre
n have this here.  You know, 
maybe we tookin  retrospect, 
things look differently butbut life was very 
pleasant.  We had everything, so we were 

properly spoiled because of that, but th isuntil '39 and the war, the PoleGerman war 
started.  So
 
Q: How religious was your family?
 
A: Oh, my father was very relig
ious, very religious.  It was a very kosher home.  Yes, my  
father was very religious.
 
Q: If we could just go back.  You di
d bring the picture of your sister.
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Can we talk a little bit about that?
 
A: Oh, as far as I rememberI don 't re
membermy mothershe 
was killed in '43.
 
Q: Your sister.
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Esther.
 
A: Yes.
 
Oh, she went to gymnasium, whic
h not many could affo rd, so she
 
Q: And that was a private institute, sir?
 
A: Yes, it was in Primishl
ana.  It's Emryten (ph). 
 
Q: So this is hercan you tell us what this 
is, which card this is?  
This is her gymnasium 
picture?
 
A: Yes.  The name was _______________
____+ Po lish gymnasium.  The name of 
Kveenyaveega (ph) in  Primishlana.
 
Q: I see.
 
A: And those teachers whic
hI don't know nobody.
 
Q: Do you know how old sh
e was when  this was taken?
 
A: I cannot tell if this is my  brother, becaus
e I couldn't understand th
e whole '33, '43.  
She was _______________
__+, but in '43, Jews couldn't  go anywhere.  I couldn't go to 
school, so this must be somewhere in be
tween, or maybe somethingten year or 
something.  But this was done by Vadel, 
a Jewish photographer.  I knew him.  I 
remember him very well because
 I used to go to him with
 my mother, my parents' 
pictures.  But he was killed in '41 so I c
ouldn't understand how th
is was madethis was 
probably  made between '33 andbut notmaybe in 
'43.  This is hard for me to describe.
 

Q: Uhu.
 
A: And I don'tI think this was a religious t
eacher.  He was Jewish.  Yes, he was feshtop 
(ph); he's n o t alive. It seem
s to me that this
 gentleman is also Jewish.  Is he?
 
Q: So th ere were both Jewish and nonJew
ish students at the gymnasium as well?
 
A: Yes, yes.  Oh my God, and more Jewish
.  She, too, had the Jewishtwo other Jewish 
girls.  I don't know.  They got a picture from 
a Gentile and probab ly theyth is is how th ey 
indicate the Jews who are not alive pr
obably.  _________
_________+ not been 
someduring the gymnasium was notthis couldn't
 be of them.  Or may b e when this was 
done, maybe there's just indication 
of Jews.  So for me, it's, you know
 
I asked my  mo ther and she told meof course
, she knewshe knew th e other one.  She knew 
all the Jews there.
 
Q: Your mother kn
ew all the Jews?
 
A: She know them.  Sh
e know the teacher.  She knew also
I remember she mentioned this:  
Her name was Flusay Lord (ph).  She was a 
Polish woman, a Polish 
teacher.  But thisbut 
one thing is for sure, that Vadel couldn't  have
 made this in '43.  Was killed.  And my 
sister,  if thi s was in '43, she wouldn't be.  
Not only, all the Jews wouldn't beso it mu st be 
done, the picture, but the occasion, 
they couldn't come, in  the sense.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: And being in Russia after the warfirst of 
all, we gotabout two, three years after we 
were liberated and then we fi
nd somebody who made a pictur
e of my  sister based on th is 
one.  So  we have it at home, a big picture. Th
at's what I can't tell 
about this picture and 
what her story.  Sh e was a very bright girl. 
 Sh e spoke English, she was planning to  study 
medicine somewhere overseasoverseas in the 
West, not in Poland.  She had a lot of 
friends.  She helped us a lot 
from '41 to  '43.  She wo rk ed
; life was very difficult. And 
after our ghetto was liquidated,
 we were hiding immediately,
 and she was walking in  the 
city, in the camp.  It w as not a concentra
tion camp per se but it was a working camp .  
Jews and Po les work  there.  You ask me w
hy she was there?  She could have escaped 

with us but she was trying to retr
ieve some things for us to be
 able to continue hiding and 
living, etcetera. Me and my  mo ther and my  si
ster were hiding at that time inby Poles, 
outside the city, and I used to go to  visit 
her. I remember I visited her twice or three 
times.  She couldn't visit us.  And when  I vi
sit her the next time, I don'tthe third or the 
fourth one, she wasn't  there,
 and I reme mb er I was surrounded by Polish girls and Jewish 
girls.  And I said, "Where is Esther?"  And th
ey saidthey didn't tell
 me that she  was taken 
away, of course, and killed probably immediatel
y there.  Said, "She went to an other place 
to work."  And then I asked,
 "Can I come tomorrow and see 
her?"  And I remember they 
told me, "No.  If she come back
, she'll come and visit you."  Of
 course, in retro spect this 

was a preludium.  It was painful for them, and I was beginning to  cry 
_________________+ 
something.  
 
Q: Do you reme mb er when  the war began?
 
A: Oh, yes, remember September 1, 
'39.  Yeah, how well I remember it.
 
Q: And how did other people 
react?  How did your parents react when the war began?
 
A: They act scaredthey were scared, norma
lly.  We knew thatwe didn't knowI couldn't 
understand that they would know what the Ge
rmans are doing; th ey would probably  run 
to Russia, from one part. For the other part
, we were welloff, and the Russians sent many 
to Siberia.  My auntmy aunt from Gleenyana (
ph) they were owners of a factory so they 
wereher husband was arrested, and my aunt and 
her daughter Arella was taken to Siberia.  
Unfortunately for them, they di
dn't survive thereno, unfortunately for th
em, they survived 
but they came back in '41.  They came back
 because my  parents, ma ny people around 
spoke about them very highly, positively, and they wrote to the Russian government that 

they were not for Bourgeois who exploit othe
r people.  Can you imagine that?  In '41, 
they letshe came back, and he
r husband came  out from the jail because of intervention.  
Couldn't understand how th
isand of course he very, very  
happy wh en she came back but 
in two months laterin two or three months la
ter the GermanRussian war started.  If they 
would stay there, maybe they would surviv
e.  Maybe he wouldher husband, Mosha, 

would have gone to see them, but t
hose ____________________
+ she came back, 
unfortunately, for them. In '41,
 my father was killed, and my
 two uncles were killed, in 
November.  The Germans cam
e to  our town in July.
 
Q: What was it like when 
they  occupied
 th e to wn ?
 
A: It was very, very scary.  The Jews were ta
ken immediately, in a ve
ry arrogant way. On 
Novemb er 5th, my  father and my two uncles
 were orderedthey got 
ordered Novemb er the 
4th by th e Jewish Judenrat, the Jewishcame 
to the same place wh
ere my sist er went.
 
Q: Which is the gymnasium?
 
A: The gymnasium, yes.  Of course, at th
at time there was not anythere wasn't  a 
gymnasium.  I don't rememb er wasI don't rememb
er what.  And from there, the same day, 
they took them to th
e woods and shot them.  So this 
was the connection with the same 
place. Oh, of course I remember very we ll the Judenrat asked 
everybody to bring 
whatever they possessed, gold 
things, in order to buy them out.  We were very naive, 
naive people, thought everything would

around 3:00 o'clock 
I was trying to run to see them b u tthe str
eets were emp ty and ar
ound 3:00, 4:00 o'clock 
they began to take groups to th e woods in 
our city, Snutwasfada (ph).  It was a very 
beautiful place.  But the shooting was alrea
dy going on, we can he
ar this. And around 
5:00 or 6:00 o'clock, women 
were cryingRoma, Romasand I re
member that I wasI gottold 

my  parents and my  sister that I'm going to to 
the place of them, and I went.  As a child, I 
well reme mb er I hadI had the Aryan look at th
at time, and tw o or three people mo re went 
to this place. It was already night.  
The Ukrainian police a
nd the Germansmostly 
Ukrainianwere they went to the 
city to eat, to drink, and 
then they  came back to bury 
them.  Not they, probably, it wa
s But then I went to the wood
sI went close to the place 
where they were shot, and I remember that  there were some cries o f probably many 
people wh o were wounded, and I was scared 
and I run back, and I to ld the story to my  
parents, to other people there.  So ot
her peoplesomemo stly, of course, Romathey 

followed, they run to this place,
 and th ey didn't came back.  Th
ey were shot also there. So 
I was lucky that didn'tso this
 was but prior to this my 
fat h er __________
______+.  My 
uncles were taken to jobs to work.
 
Q: They were taken by the
 
A: By the Germans, the Ukraines, or by the 
Jewish police.  They told them where to 
come and to do work.  This
 was prior to November 5th.
  Then they were killed.
 
Q: How else do you rememb er your life changing
 befo re Novemb er, when  they went into  
your town?
 
A: Oh, changed immediately.  First of all, Ididn't went to school.  My Polish friends, still 
some of them werewe met, we play.  Also, they
 went to school, so we have to meet after 
school.  We didn't go to school. Soand we
 lived in the same 
building untilI don't 
reme mb erand th en our building was converted  to
 a Jewish hospital.  Was a big one.  So  
they moved to another place, of course, 
in a crowded apartment, not like our own.
 
Q: So you were evicted from your home.
 
A: Yes.  
 
And then  in '42 wasI rememb er aktion, one 
of theand my  grandmother was with us, and 
she wasshe disappeared.  I don't remember, th
ere were conditions, ho
w they survived.  
She was all sick, and shewe lived in a hous e in a Gentileit wasn 't the typical Jewish 

neighborhood.  And there was a ga
rden there and I remember you 

___________________
+ my mother, she went to the ga
rden some.  But we came back, 
she wasn't  there.  So, they took her.
 
Q: Do you know what
 
A: In '42I don't reme mber the monthwas a bi
g aktion, many Jews were taken.  But after a 
few hours my  mo ther and my  sister came back
 from somewhere.  I was hiding in another 
place.
 
Q: Where did you hi
de, do you rememb er?
 

A: In a Polish neighbor place.  They took me in.
 
Q: Your neighbors took you? 
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Is that what you said?
 
A: Because I ______________
____+ up to them.  And I 
don't remember where my 
mother was hiding.  She told me.  It was th
e same, somewhere in a 
Polish place, by Po les.  
And they came back, of course.  Life was 
already not typical, because my  grandmother 
disappeared.  My mother cried, I cried, we all cried.
 
Q: Do you recall any other an
tiSemitic actions carried out by
 the forces at that time?
 
A: Oh, th ere wereyou meanwhic
h forces you have in mind? 
 There was the killer group 
that they were call ed Einzergroppen.  They killed my parentsno, I'm sorry, my father, my 
two uncles, and they  left _______________.
 and from time to time there were small 
aktion, and they came, they t
ook Jews to work, the camps, 
etcetera, the camps that were 
around our city. This didn't apply to my  uncles
, to my father; they were not ready to life 

at that time, in '41, in '42. 
 Then in '42 there was a ghetto.  
So th ey moved from this place 
to the ghetto.  Our h
ouse was in the ghetto.
 
Q: Which house?
 
A: Where the hospital was.
 
Q: Where you were moved.
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Was located in the ghetto.
 
A: This was located in the ghetto
 and this why they th ey made 
a Jew ish hospital there.  It 
was a big house.  Because I remember onc
e _____________+ 
they took the patients from 
the ghettofrom our house and 
they shoot them 
_______________
___+.  I remember I 
saw some picturesnot pictures I saw, but then
 the dead were remove
d and this happened.  
This house was still consid
ered the Jewish hospital.
 
Q: So you lived in th e hospital?
 
A: No, I lived in the ghetto, another place al
ready.  First, we moved to athere was no 
ghetto immediately but when  the ghetto wa
s created, I moved from other house to the 
ghetto.
 
Q: And where in the ghetto did you live?
 

A: In the ghetto we lived in another house,
 we crowded with other people.  There were 
aktions sometimes so we run away.  And the final life in the ghetto was until May the 
20th.
 
Q: What was
 
A: There were rumors that th
ere will be aktions, but there were very often the rumors.  
We had connections before, but from the ghe
tto we couldn't get out.  But we had some 
hiding place where we lived, and 
when the aktion started I reme
mb er very well there was 
a kitchen.  You open ed the kitchen and 
thro ugh th e kitchen we went down to  a 
something, and from there I re
memberI didn't participate in
 it but they built something 
inside, lower, and thank for thissorrywe su
rviv ed because the Germans discovered the 
entry but nothing was there.  
Now they discovered 
but nothing was there, we were below.
 
I reme mb er it was crowded because all the pe
ople from the building went down.  And I 
remember my sister, we are s
itting th ere, a wall of us on 
some soft things, and this 
wasand at night we went out, at nighttime, af
ter being there one dayo
ne day or two days, 
I don't rememb er.  I don't reme mber; I lost cons
cious there, but my  sister put some soft 

things on me, with my mother.
 
Q: Which sister?
 
A: What?  Esther, beca
use Ida was smaller.  
 
Q: She was younger than you, right.
 
A: And we came out.  Was nighttime, the ghetto
 was burning, and some way we went out 
to a neighbor 's _______________, 
in Spirtka (ph), and they took
 us in for one day.  But 
they were afraid to keep us, and I understand.
 
Q: And thesedid you know
 them before the war?
 
A: Oh, yes.  Even during the 
war, when there were rumors of
 an aktion, and we came to 
them, they let us sleep over, me and my si
ster.  My mo ther went to another place.
 
Q: And how did you geth
ow did you get there at
 night, you said?  When  you were in the 
ghetto at this time, how did you get out?
 
A: The ghetto was not
 surrounded already. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: I assume.  I assume 
it was surr ound
ed before.
 
Q: Uhu.
 

A: But they did everything.  They killed many 
people in the streets. 
 I remember when we 
came out at night we saw someI saw some dead
 bodies, but this was at night.  And from 
there we went to another place, through some
 connections, and they 
took us in for a few 
days.
 
Q: And do you remember their 
names or where they lived?
 
A: No, their names I d on't remember.  Now th
e first name I remember: Bispertka (ph).  
But the other people who to ok us in for a 
few days only, I don't remember.  And from 
there we went to another place, Sokolik , in Bo
rochoff (ph).  It's a village.  They  kept us 
for three months.
 
Q: And do you recall their names?
 
A: What?
 
Q: Do you remember their names?
 
A: Yes, Sokolik .
 
Q: Sokolik.
 
A: Yes.  The grandchildren, they are there 
in Jerusalem, y es, fo
r saving us.  Not saving 
completely but worse time, not of them, we 
wouldn't be alive, we wouldn't  be ablebut 
being there, very often we were afraid be
cause the Ukrainian police.  And I remember 
one ev ening they to ld us to get out, because 
there were big gardens there, and sit there, 
because they  were afraid, becau
se the Ukrain e police, they're 
looking for Jews there.  Not 
immediately, because they had 
a lot of work to do in th
e city, but after being there 
probably  a month, at night they  took us out a
nd th ey suggest us to go
 into the 
corncorn, a 
lot of corn there, just sitting there.
 
Q: In the cornfield.
 
A: Yes, in the cornfield, me 
and my  mo ther and my  sister.
 
Q: And at this point who 
was in hiding with you?
 
A: What?
 
Q: Who was in hiding with you at
 this point?  It was your mo ther
 
A: My moth er.
 
Q: And Ida.
 
A: Ida, and Esther.
 
Q: And Esther.
 

A: Yes. After the ghetto was liquidated, when 
we run to those neighbors on the farm, my  
sister went tothere was a 
walking Kinder underway.
 
Q: Do you remember 
the name of the camp?
 
A: No, I cannot remember the na
me.  Someno, just people we
re walking there, Poles.  
And my  sister's intention was 
to go over there, which she 
did, to go over there to find 
some hiding place for us, because we were lo
st and, you knowshe know where we were 
but she co uldn't go there.
 
Q: How old was she at this time?
 
A: I think probabl
y 20, I don't know.
 
Q: Around 20, yes. 
 
A: And I used to visit her fromand after two, three visits
 
Q: When  you visited her at? 
 
A: At the working place.
 
Q: And where were you at this time?
 
A: Already hiding.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: In another place.  Not in the city, already;
 outside the city with 
my mother.  And sheI 
think once she came to  visit at night also, once or 
twice.  And that's it.  I used to visit her 
a few times.
 
Q: What was she working on at the camp?
 
A: What?
 
Q: What type of labor did she do?
 
A: I don't know.  They did some agricultural 
labor.  Some of them 
went to work to the 
ghetto, to do some work in th
e ghetto, cleaning.  And the a
ssumption was to 
helpshe told 
us she would go back  to the ghetto so maybe she would be able to take some things from 
our place where we lived.  We had some valu
able things.  Not ma
ny, because the most 
the Germans took or the Jewish Judenrat took them.  And my  father and my  uncles there, 
we thought that they would be
 ab le to take them out because of theto buy them out.
 
Q: But she went back  to se
e if there was anything after?  Had it been liquidated?
 
A: No.  Sheif she went to walk to the ghetto, she co
uld have.  If not, ________+ 
 

Q: Uhu.
 
A: But she never went back to
 our place, she told me, and I believed her.  I met her a few 
times. And then one thing,
 when  she wentsh e scratched her leg some where, 
unfortunately, and sh e had to 
bend it, and the Ukrainian police and the German came and 
they look they saw, and becau
se of that, they took her ou
t.  I assume, but they maybe 
thought that she couldn't 
work, that she couldn't be so productive or maybema ybe 
theythey  took a few people and they shot 
them.  That's  how my sister's end was.
 
Q: That's h o w she died?  
 
Yes.  But at that time we were already 
at Sokolik's  place, 
in Borochoff (ph). 
 
Q: Can you spell Sokoli
k?  Do you remember?
 
A: Spell you?  
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: I spell it in Latin and then
 inin Ukrainian this
 was like this.  {Writing}  This is the 
Latin name, Sokllyk [sic}.  Michael.  
 
Q: So that's  SOKLLYK [sic]. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And his first name  was Michael.
 
A: Yes.  We were already in his place, 
and I remember they shootwhen I came back, 
shooting there all the time.  At
 night then  we can listen.  
And probably when  I came back, 
when Ithey said to myI to

 came back, and __

A: Yes, this was underg round 
butof course it was undergr

think my mother's cousins, th

I remember sometimeonce there 
was aktion.  Shooting.  The 
Germans, I don'tUkrainian.  
I run away, disorganized.  My
 mother was different places.  My sister Ida was with 
Bronyah (ph).  I was by myself somewhere.  I

because they friends and some 
Poles, Ukraine but mostly Po les gave us food, gave food 
to Mommie, but you cannot goMommie went once a week , twiceonce a week, maybe 
once in tw o weeks, I don't reme mber, because

Q: But you saw it.
 
A: This was there.  And the Ukrainians were 
already living th ere, people were living.  It 
didn't  bother them.  So we find an apartmen
t in anothera Jewish apartment in another 
place and begin to look around. 
 I remember the city wasthe
 ghetto was destroyed.  The 
city was completely different, the people we
remany people from the villages came to the 
city so never knew them.  A few of my scho
ol friends, neighbor 
friends with whom I 
used to play, they find th
e life good. And then  immediately the city calls for 
______________not to take
 care of us but we didn't ha
ve any papers, nothing.  We 
couldwent to neighbors' place s to f ind some
thing, pictures, nothi
ng. This picture was 

given to me later to us.  We didn't  have
 documents so we have to establish birth 
certificates, who we are, what we are, school. And I rememb eroh, yes, when I was in the 
wood, I remember my mother
 taught me _______________ I can write and read, but I 
didn't  have what to read.  But math a little bit,
 soand of course I missed four years, three 

years of school.  So  I came 
backso they gave us tests.
 
Q: This isthis is after the war?
 
A: Liberation, yes, after liberation.
 
Q: After liberation
 
A: In Primishana, yes.
 
Q: And before you reentered 
school would you sayhow manywho
 did you know else that 
had surv ived ?  You said some of your school mates.
 
A: No, not many survived.  I kn
ow we met, like I told you, my  au nt, thosesome other 
people, another Jewish ________
__.  About 20 people there in 
the city, I would say.  Not 
families per se.  A family cons
ists of one person, two persons.
 
We were the only one family whic
h surviv ed three people of us.
 
Q: Your family.
 
A: Yes.  Oh, and another family from th
e village, from the same
 village, survived 
probably  five, six people, which probably  they
 survived from the Booth (ph) family.  But 
from the city some people came, b egan comi
ng back from Russia, one, two people.  No, 
no, the city consists probably 
at that time from 20, 30 Jews.
 
Q: And so th en youyou movedwhere did you
 and your mo ther and sister go exactly?
 
A: We got apartment.  My 
mo ther began to wo rk immediately some where, I don't 
remember where, because she has to make it
 to live for _______.  Some neighbors gave 
us something.  Nobody gave us back any 
clothing becauseI don't remember.  B u t we got 
some clothing from people, otherwisewe coul
dn't buy, we didn't have money for what to 
buy it.  And I rememb er I was very eager to start school, to see ______________+. 
 
And there was a Jewish teacher in '41, Leekman (ph).  He wroteso he survived the war.  
He was teaching me after the war immediatel
y, because he gave me some privatenot 
private _____________ ________+.  He said,  Rubin, you have
 to go to one or two classes 
higher; you will make it.  And I 
don't remember which grade he 
put me in, fourth or third, 
I don't rememb er. School was difficult.  I was very often hungry in school.
 
Q: What did you do for food
?  Your mother was work ing.
 

A: Yes, Mother cooked.  __
________________+  But still, ot
her people, I remember they 
came to sch ool with sandwiches that _
___________________+.  I didn't  have this.
 
Q: So, were there Jews and nonJews again?
 
A: What?
 
Q: Your school had both Jewish
 and nonJewish students again?
 
A: No.  Most nonJewish
 
Q: Or there weren't many left.
 
A: Jewish students were me, my si ster, one ot
her.  I would say seven, eight Jewish kids.
 
Q: And how were you treat
ed by the nonJewish kids?
 
A: Not so friendly.  Not soyou see, they saw 
what had been done to Jews so everything 
came out from this.  Of course, I played with
 them, played soccer, but
 they don't invited 
us to their homes, nothing.  In the beginni
ng. Later, two, three years later when we 
growwhen the senior class, a 
little bit closer, but you felt 
some coolness.  Because the 
biggest mistake was that we didn 't  left 
immed iately for Poland. And now I will tell you 
why.  When the Russians liberated us we
 became soI thought I'
m a human being, I 
thought I'm a normal person.  Some of our people, even my  aunt, she left forrun aw ay 
because her sons were taken to the Russian 
Army.  And those whohad people in the age 
you could be taken to the Army , they run away
 to Poland.  This wa
s officiallylegally, we 

have to apply for permit to go 
to Poland, which my 
mother did.  I remember sh e filled out 
some papers.  And the post office
 wasn't working so well but 
I don'tand we were told that 
we should send this to Schw
orchoff (ph). We send it, to 
get the permit to return to 
Poland.  Because at that time we knew alread
y that this would be a Russian Ukraine and 
Poland would be Po land.  Of co urse, we feel
 more comfortable in 
Poland. But we never 
got the reply, never.  But my  mo ther could 
have tried to go without
 some papers, which 
wasshe was scared probably.  A
nd then some rumors came that
 in Poland, their pogroms, 
which was through, and so my mother calle
d up, said, Herethere are no pogroms here 
because the Russians are here.  And this was wh
enbut then we went to
 school and I don't 
knowwe were happy with the minimu m that we 
have.  But if we woul
d go to Polandfirst 
of all, life in Poland for Je
ws was much better.  I'm sorry
.  And from Poland, as we 
learned later, we could be tryi
ng to go to Czechoslovakia, to
 Vienna, to Israel, because 
Russia was close.  Poland wasand 
besides, the Poles closed thei
r eyes when Jews left also 
from Poland. My aunt, with her two sons, left 
for Poland in order fo
r them to avoid the 
Army.  In Poland, 
they were _________
____________________
+ because they were of 
draft age.  So they left for Czechoslovakia, 
and from there to Germany. I don't  know if it 
you know th e story, that this
 wasprobably the Israelis arra
nged those things for them, I 
don't know.  But they left Poland after one year
 of being in Poland.  It was a pogrom in 

Krakow, too, so Po land was also not the best
 place to be. But compared to Russia, was a 
wonderful place. And we liv
ed in Russia until '57.
 
Q: And youhow did you begi
n rebuilding your life there?
 
A: Rebuilding my  life, I graduate from high sc
hool, applied to law scho
ol in Lewolf (ph).  
I was not accepted to law school.  I worked a y
ear in a law office in
 my town because I 
was interested in law.  Not based on so me re

 How about you? And he said,

 And I said, My name shitle. 
You're not in the list of the university.  Why I'

And I'm th ere. And then I came in and I said,

And he said, No , it's not a mist

then I remember something:  Oh, of course,

Q: How did you feel about bein
g in the German department?
 
A: Veryvery uncomfortable.  But I wasn't the 
only Jew.  There was six Jews of us.  Only  
two of them applied for German, because on
e was a daughter of a Russian officer who 
was in Germany.  The other was something. 
 Me and somewe were outsiders.  I didn 't 
feel comfortable.  Can you imagine?  But

But then when I was there I not

Q: Did you live in an ar

A: Oh, yes.  In Stretchen there are a lot of
 Jews at that time.  But many Jews, they're 
leaving for Israel.  We couldn't le a v e i

And I got the job and I made a living.  I could live, could

children, my  family.  My sister, also.  Fo
r years you cannotbut I neverI didn't  consider 
my self a happy man, even with my  family w
ith my children. This 
I'm telling you, hoping 
I wouldn't say this to my children.  I don 't wa
nt them to feelof course, the biggest thing, 
th e mo re h ap p iest mo men t was my  marri ag e, 
my children.  This 
wasnow they havemy  
parents have their names.  My father was

shouldn't complain, this, this.  They 're not settled privately, which I worry about, seeing 
the American things, the American  atmosphere; I am worried abou

Europe my  children wouldn't have any prob
lem getting any _________.  In Po land, I

 else helped out, too, I don't k n ow.  We 
always say thank to her and 
to God, wh ich I'm saying. Bu
