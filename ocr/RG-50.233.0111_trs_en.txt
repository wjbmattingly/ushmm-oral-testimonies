A: My name  is Heinz Rosenberg. I was born September 15, 1921 in Gottingen, Germa ny. 

 

Q: How big is that? 

 

A: Gottingen wa s a university city, very fa mous for 
t he universities, students.
  It was a very old 
city, a very prosperous city and we lived in a 
beautiful home.  My father had a linen factory. 
 

Q: A linen factory?   Is th
at like a textile factory?  
 

A: A textile factory, which was confiscated by 
the Nazis already in 1933 
because Gottingen was 
one of the high spots of Nazism, like all the uni
versities, Heidelberg, Gottingen, Partabon , all 
of these cities with big universi ti
es became the symbol of Nazism. 
 

Q: Is this Gottingen, is that in Bavaria? 

 

A: No Gottingen is between Hanover and _____ in th
e mi ddle of Germany.  I  can show it to you on 
the map. 
 

Q: Can you tell me , you said you had a brother a
nd a sister, so there 
were three children. 
 

A: We  were three children at home.  I had a 
brother who was born 1915 a
nd a sister who was born 
1917. 
 
Q: Do you remember their birthdays? 
 

A: Yes, my brother was born, I will have to look 
it up, one second.  My brothe r was born June 4, 
1915 and my sister was born June 16, 1917. 
 

Q: Did your mo ther help out with the business also? 

 

A: No, no, my mother was 
strictly a housewife. 
 

Q: Did Gottinge n have a very sizeable Je wish community? 

 

A: It was a very lot of Rosenbergs and Grosenbe
rgs intermarriages.  I would think there were 
about, the city was about 40,000 people when I wa
s a child.  I imagine there were about 2,000 

Jewish people there. All were well off. 
 

Q: Some of the German Jews I talked to said they weren™t very religious. 

 

A: We  were not religious 
at  all.  Not religious. 
 

Q: We re there ma ny religious people? 

 

A: Yes, there were also. We had a very beautif
ul synagogue in Gottingen and my father also went 
to the High Holy days, but I personally was not
 and I am still non- religious I must say. 

 
Q: Did you attend private school or public school? 

 

A: No I attended public school and we had to le
ave.  We  were thrown out of Gottingen in 1934.  
The factory was confiscated and 
the owner of the house came with 
SR me n and told my father 
if you are not out by next week, we throw you in the furnace or  out of the window. Which they 

actually did to him.  
 

Q: This is of your house or of your business? 

 

A: No, no. The  business was confiscated in 1933 by the city of Gottingen. This was the house we 
lived in. 
 

Q: When they confiscated the bus
iness, was there a reason given? 

 

A: The reason was given that in 1928 and ™
29, there was a world depression and like ma ny 
businesses the business went bad and so the city 
of Gottingen said we need the business and the 
Jews cannot do it anymore so we ju
st take it over. And they 
rename d it from S & R Rosenberg 
to Gottinge n Linen _____ which me a ns the City of Gottingen Linen Factor y. 
 

Q: After that your father was no l
onger involved in the business at all. 
 

A: Well my father was permitted, because he always travel ed as a salesman to Hamburg and the 
first three years he coul d stil
l do a little bit of work, but th
e companies in Ha mburg did not 
accept a Jewi sh salesman anymore.  So it died out by itself. 
 
Q: Can you describe a little bit when 
they came and ma de you leave your home ?  
 
A: I was too small .  I only know what my father
 told me  that 
one morning the owner of the house 
came with three SR me n which is like SS people, 
and put a gun on the table 
and told him, if you 
Jew are not out within one week we throw you and 
the furniture out of th
e window. That™s all I 
r e me mb e r.  
 

Q: So a week later they came back. 

 

A: No, no, then my father told them, look it ca
nnot be done in a week, 
I have to find a new 
apartment first, but within four weeks we m
oved to Hamburg because my mother was born in 
Ha mburg and my father who was a very old Germ
an couldn™t believe what was happening said 
this will pass. And Hamburg was a much better 
city, it was not such anti-Semitism as it was in 
Gottingen.  So we bought a beautiful apartment in
 Ha mburg and we moved to Hamb urg, and we 
were hoping, my father was hoping, that this woul d pass and he would get everything back in 

Gottingen.  My father was in the FirstWorldWa r like all other. 
 

Q: He was a veteran? 

 

A: My whole family.  Many were killed in the FirstWorldWa r. 

 

Q: Did he get another job in Ha mburg? 

 

A: He couldn™t get a job in Ha mburg, but my brothe
r worked and my sister started working and we 
got some  money from a very rich uncle in Hanov
er.  So we could survive.  I also started 
working.  I was thrown out of 
school.   I was an apprentice. 
 
Q: When were you thrown out of school? 

 

A: I was thrown out of school when I was 14 years old in 1935. 

 

Q: And that was in Hamburg? 

 

A: In Hamburg, yes.  No mo re Jews could go to German schools. 

 

Q: We re there private Jewish schools? 

 

A: Ye s, but we didn™t have the m
oney so that I could go there.  I 
became an apprentice in a Jewish 
export and import comp any. You couldn™t get a j
ob in a gentile business so you had to be in a 
Jewish business. 
 

Q: What did you do there? 

 

A: Export and import. 

 

Q: Did you do like clerical work? 

 

A: Clerical work, yes. 

 
Q? Where did your brot
her and sister work? 
 

A: My brother and sister worked 
at two big Jewish departme nt st
ores as salespeople.  One was 
called Gabruder Robeson and Gabruder Heft, but th
at™s  not important, and my brother, by the 
way, was taken in 1938 from that particular st
ore to the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen 
in ™38. 
 

Q: Did they both finish school
 before they took these jobs? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: They were also thrown out of school? 

 

A: Not thrown out. We mo ved fr om Gottingen and my
 fa ther had no more money, it™s very simple.  
We  had to work. They were older than I was. 
 My brother, in 1933 was 
already much older, 18 
or some thing.  He became  an apprentice.  In Germany you have to be an apprentice for three 

years before you can call yourself a full- fledged 
salesperson.  Here you st
art without anything. 
 

Q: Can you tell me a little 
bit about when they came a
nd took your brother away?   
 

A: They didn™t come  to us, he was working. That was the Kristallnacht when all the Jewi sh stores 
were demolished. We  don™t know how he was taken, we only got a telephone call from 

some body who had left in time and told us that 
all Jewish employees me n had been taken to 

prison. That™s  all we know. 
 
Q: That™s all they said? 

 

A: Ye s. Then we heard from all over the same
 stories and we didn™t know where he was until one 
day we got a postcard from hi m. The y were pe
rmitted to write one postcard, that I am well off 
in Sachsenhausen for a short time.  It wasn™t  a short time he was there until Febr uary or March 

1939.  He was very badly beaten and sick when he came out.  He had something with the leg, I 

don™t reme mber what it was, they had beaten his leg.  I don™t reme mber these things.  He 

couldn™t work any more and then he went, 
the British opened the Kitche ner camp for young 
Jews who had to get out.  He got a red stam
p on his passport that said if you don™t leave 
Germany within three months you go back to camp. 
 

Q: Did he ever describe to y
ou what Sachsenhausen was like? 
 

A: We ll he told us exactly how it was. Ye s, exactly. 

 

Q: What did he say? 

 

A: It was a tremendous ca mp and the Jews were 
beaten and mi shandled 
and treated the worst. 
 

Q: We re there other people there besides Jews? 

 

A: Jews were the mi nority. 

 

Q: Who else was there? 
 
A: Anti-German, anti-Nazi, homosexuals, people who 
didn™t want to work. All different types of 
people. 
 

Q: We rethereCommuni
st people there also? 
 

A: Plenty of Communists.  But you see, these peop
le who have been there already three or four 
years and survived, they were 
already the kapos.You know what kapos are?  They were the 
leader. You see the SS only was the guard, while
 the prisoners themselves were the people who 
did all the work inside the camp. And these fe
w Communists who were there since ™33 and had 
survived, they were now the _______ commandos a
nd the SS of course did the beating and the 
killing.  But ma ny of these kapos were more br
utal than the SS. You see the SS used the 

difference of the nationalities or religions agai
nst each other in the 
prison camps. You see? 
 

A: So basically, the Jews were treat
ed the worst of the people there? 
 

A: Oh, yes, of course. 

 

Q: So political prisoners w
ould be of a higher level. 
 

A: If they survived.  Many did not survive. 

 

Q: We re they taken to work out of this camp?  

 
A: At that time there was no work so they had 
to shovel sand from one mountain and build a new 
mountain to be busy. The work was at that ti
me  in the concentration camp yes, they ma de 
streets inside the camp and they worked from
 six in the morning until six in the night. 
 

Q: But they just ma de them work to keep them busy.  

 

A: To exhaust them. While in other camps lik
e Neuengamme t hey built tremendous bi g channels 
and things like this.  It wa s a different camp.  Bu
t  the real work that the prisoners were put to 
work started after 1939, af
ter the war started. 
 

Q: Did your parents try to get in contact with him 
after he sent the postcar
d or tried to go there? 
 

A: My father went to the poli
ce station in our neighborhood and tr
ied, we tried to send packages 
we do not know if he got it or not.  I was a small 
kid and basically couldn™t
 do anything at all.  
We  do not know if the packages arrived or not 
and my mother wrotea 
letter, after the first 
postcard, it said Rosenberg, number 
so and so, and we do not know.  He
 later told us that he got 
three letters.  My mother wrote every week. 
 

Q: But not the packages, you do not know. 

 

A: He got one or two packages for Christma s, or some thing. 

 

Q: What did they tell your fa
ther at the police station? 
 

A: Nothing, we don™t know anything. 
 
Q: They didn™t say anything. 

 

A: No,nothing. 

 

Q: Can you describe to me  Kristalln
acht?   Do you reme mber anything? 
 

A: Ye s, exactly.  I was already working at that 
time .  I started working 
as an apprentice at the 
export/import company ofArtur Cohen in 1936 
and this company was taken over after the 
Kristallnacht  by an SS offi cer. When Kristallnac
ht happened, I think there were only Jewish 
owners there who were taken to prison from th
eir homes, Dr. Cohen and Mr. There were two 
_________ two assistant Jews, the others were alrea
dy all gentiles and I 
was an apprentice and 
for whatever reason, they were not 
interested in me .  I didn™t go home , I tried to stay away from 
home because I heard the rumors and I went home late at night. 
 

Q: This was in Nove mber? 

 

A: Nove mber 8, 1938. 

 

Q: So you stayed late at your office.  
And SS officers came to your place of work? 
 

A: They came a nd took away the two assistants.  
Dr. Cohen has been taken away already from his 
home , he was a very famous ma n bec a use his fath
er was a senator before him.  Both of the 

brothers were taken. They moved later on to SouthAfrica.  I still have a letter from them a fter 
the separation. When I came home I heard from 
my mother that my brother was taken to prison 
and when my father went to the police, this is 
an interesting story. You know, in Germany every 
year you have different police departme nts in diff
erent parts of the city and when my  father 
came there and he asked by sheer coincidence the 
officer in charge was a for mer comr ade in 
arms fromWorldWa r I, and he said, Fritz Rosenbe
rg, come  in here for a mi nute. And he told 

him what are you doing here, are yo
u crazy to come  here?   I have
 orders on my list to bring you 
in.  But he said look we fought together inWo
rldWa r 1, so I said, look, I tell you what I do, you 
go out this door and don™t go home before tomorrow morning so if some body come s there you 

are not home. And that™s what my father did. He
 went to my aunt who was a lady and there was 

nobody living there, lived in the ne
ighborhood and he stayed there all 
night. You see. And that 
German police officer because he was by sheer coincidence a for mer comrade in arms from 

WorldWar 1 saved my father from prison.  Mo
st probably he wouldn™t have survived anyhow. 
My brother was young, that™s a different story.
  But ma ny people didn™t come  back from 
Kristallnacht . They were beaten already wh
en they got into the camp and the German SS 

would you know. 
 

Q: Did the police come  to your house that evening? 

 

A: No, my mother said nobody came. 

 

Q: So when did you get home ?  The next morning? 

 

A: I also went home . At that 
time  we c ould still go out anytim
e we want.  I had a girlfriend, a 
young girlfriend.  I went to her house and I called 
my parents and I said, look I™m staying with, 
I forgot her name.  I a m sorry 
to tell you, Eva.  I™m staying with
 Eva.  She was transported to 
Riga and mu rdered there.  Everybody died some where. 
 

Q: Now, let see, do you remember what dama ge was  done? 

 

A: All synagogues, all Jewish business was de
stroyed, windows broken, stolen me rchandise.  It 
looked like a hurricane.  Many Jewish apartmen
ts were destroyed when they came in the SS 
people or SR people at that time. 
 

Q: Did you go back to work that next day? 

 

A: I went back to work the next day, yes.
 You see, you have to understand, our German 
upbringing, even though I am Jewish my basic 
upbringing, unfortunately
 you have to go to 
work.  Everybody looked at me  and said, oh it 
was terrible. These people in the export 

company the Germans were not Nazis because they
 worked with Dr. Cohen. You see I can™t tell 
you about later on, but this company was on N
ovember 9 was  confiscated by the city of 
Ha mburg and an SS officer was put in and took over
 the company.  I have his name  some where.  
I have to look in my papers, I forgot the name  right now. 
 

Q: So you lost your job? 

 

A: No, he permitted me  to finish my apprenti
ceship which was finished in ™39,April, ™39. 
 

Q: What did you do after that? 

 
A: AfterApril 1, ™39, I had to report to the une
mployment office  for Jews, which was a special 
section and when this SS ma n who was in charge
 there saw me , he said I have a very good job 
for you, he said. You go to ______ to dig channels for water. 
 

Q: And this is near Hamburg? 

 

A: We ll, it™s  about by train an 
hour and a half.  It was swamp.  
And it was barracks and there were 
about fifty Jewish me n there a
nd we had not SS guards around us 
but they just came  every day 
and counted. And we had to dig a certain am
ount.  I don™t reme mber how ma ny me t e rs.  For 
me , I was ve ry young, it didn™t mean much.  But for the older me n when they couldn™t do it, 

they told us right away th
at if you couldn™t do it we se
nd you to a concentration camp. 
 

Q: Did they do that to some  peopl
e?  We re some  people sent away? 
 

A: Ye s, yes. You know if you™re not used to this
 type of work, if you™re 
young it™s easy.  I got very 
sick the end of Septembe r and th
en I was sent home .  I got a te
rrible stomach.  I was sent home. 
 

Q: In September 30. Wa s that befo
re or after the war with Poland? 
 

A: This was still before.  No, ma ybe it was after.
  I cannot reme mber now.  It was approxima tely, I 
cannot recall, ma ybe it was end ofAugust. Thes
e dates, I cannot recall, ma ybe it was end of 
August. These dates I don™t reme mber exactly.  
I think I was home  when the war started.  But I 
had a terrible stomach, you know the 
food was terrible and the cold. 
 

Q: Did you go back and forth from Ha mbur
g or did they have a campo out there? 
 

A: No, barracks.Very primitive.  Later on they brought in Polish POWs. 

 

Q: After the war started?  Can I backtrack a li
ttle bit?  Ta lking about Hamburg and you said 
some thing about you could still on Nove mber 30
th
 go out. We re there restrictions? 
 

A: September 1, 1939 we had to wear the Jewish St
ar and we could not go out on the street after 
8:00 or 9:00 at night.  I cannot reme mber right now. 
 

Q: We rethereany 
other restrictions? 
 

A: Notelephones. 

 

Q: Did you turn them in to the authorities? 

 

A: No, they picked them up. And no radios, as
 far as I know, and I think cars were also taken 
away, as far as I know. We  had no car anyhow.  But I heard certain things. And then you see 

there™s another thing, the Nove mber action star
ted because of the murder of the German 
Ambassador, and at that time Jews had to pay thr
ee billion ma rks, or some thing. And when the 

war started we had to give up all our silver a
nd gold. That I reme mber too. We  didn™t have 
much any more because it was all sold already, 
you know. There were other restrictions. You 
couldn™t go to German movie houses any more and 
theaters and things like this. You couldn™t 

go to rest aurants because it said, in most places they had the signs, no Jews permitted. You 

couldn™t sit on a bench in the park only on a yello
w bench for Jews. There were certain things, 
but you know, I was young and I don™t  recall everything. 
 
Q: This is quite a bit, though. 

 

A: O.K.  

 

Q: So after the war star
ted, what were you doing? 
 

A: I told you. 

 

Q: Oh, yes, you were working in the barracks.  

 

A: Then when I came home, there was in th
e house of Otto Menke, there was a young ma n who 
sold fruit juices.  I was visiting 
Otto and Otto™s fa ther told me , 
Heinz, he said,A and S company 
downstairs is looking for strong me n because all th
e people we re drafted now to move these bi g 
cases ___________. You are strong.  So I went th
ere to him and I said
 Mr. Capolsky,  or 
whatever his name  was, yes I have
 a job, but I have to go to the 
Jewish unemployme nt to get the 
permission for you.  So he said you go there with
 your bicycle and I give you 24 bottles of the 
best juice, you bring it to him w
ith best regards fr om so and s o, and this letter.  So he looked at 
the letter and he yeah, yeah, he 
said, I ordered that.You™re O.K. And I worked there about one 
year. 
 

Q: What were you doing there, you were just delivering? 

 

A: No, no I couldn™t leave. I was just unloading a
nd loading these cases with bottles of juice and 
things like that.  I have the name  of t he comp
any some where.  It was very nice people. There 
were no Jewish businesse s.  Germans. After one
 year I ha d to stop there because there were 

also German wome n wor king a
nd some body must have said how 
can you let a Jew work with 
German wome n together.  So I had to stop. Then
 they sent  me  to a place to unload shoes and 
confiscated me rchandise from Belgium and France 
that raided during the war. These came in 
with tremendous trains and they were used for the Germans. 
 

Q: Where was this? 

 

A: In Hamburg. Also this wa s a warehouse.  I 
cannot tell you the street.  Hamburg is a big place, 
you know. And I had worked there until one mo rning on November 7
th
, my mother, we didn™t 
have a phone but she got word to me  that I be
tter come home there 
was an order from the 
Gestapo to be deported tomorrow and we were th
e second transport from Ha mburg. The first 
one. 
 

Q: You said November 7, this was 1940? 

 

A: 1941.  1940 I worked in the shoe f
actory, not factory, a leather one. 
 

Q: You said that you were in shoes,? 

 

A: Wa rehouse. About a year. 

 

Q: And this was seized from Jews ---- not Jews  from the population in France and Belgium ---- 
 

A: St uff that had been gained through the war? 

 

A: Confiscated by the Ge
rmans for their own good. 
 

Q: And then, November 7, 1941? 

 

A: My mother got word to me  and to my sister
, who was also working, this was not work on your 
free will, you were just told to work there, you u
nderstand.  Forced labor.  Got word to her or to 
the company that whatever she did, ma ybe a ge
ntile neighbor called, I don™t reme mbe r, if we 
would come  home , because we were deported to 
the East. We  did not know where we would 
go. 
 

Q: You said she got word to you. We re you still living at home? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: So it was during the day that the 
notice came and she had to contact you? 
 

A: The letter came by mail and she called my sister 
and me  and told us to come  home i mme diately, 
stop working. 
 

Q: And all the letter said was that 
you we re being deported to the East? 
 

A: I have the copy _______Alexander, we also ge
t a surname when the war started.  Every Jew 
had to call himself Heinz ______ and the wome n El
sa _______. This was also in ™39, I just 

r e me mb e r e d  t h i s . 
 

Q: And they said you were going to the East to work? 

 

A: No, they didn™t  say, they
 said you would be deported. 
 

Q: That™s all? 

 

A: I have the letter here.  I can 
give it to you later, a photocopy of 
the letter.  I have a photocopy of 
the letter. 
 

Q: O.K.  Did it give you a time fra me as to when you would leave? 

 

A: We  had to report the next morning at 7 0™clock, 
8 o™clock at the for mer 
Jewish lot in Ha mburg.  
With one suitcase and fifty pounds. And it said you 
have to leave the key from the home at the 
police station and the home
 must be left in perfect condition. 
Ad my mother cleaned before we 
left. You see, typical Germans, you wouldn™t beli
eve it.  If I think about it today, as I cry 
terrible to leave everything behind.You walk out, 
same  as I would have walked out of here, you 
see. 
 

Q: What did you take, do you reme mbe r? 

 

A: We ll, we took, I was lucky.  I had a gentil
e girlfriend living in my 
house and she brought me  
boots and warm stockings and everything and my 
mother took, we figured it would be to the 
East because the first transport went to Litzmannstadt. 
 

Q: So you already knew of one transport leaving? 

 

A: We  didn™t know where they went to, but we through the grapevine you heard it went to Poland. 

 

Q: How long before your transpor
t did that first one leave? 
 

A: A month later.  I have the date, if you want it. 

 

Q: No, no it™s not terribly important. 

 

A: I have the date. 

 

Q: But you knew that people had already been deported before? 

 

A: Ye s, yes. The very first transport went in 
September, right away there was Polish Jews, they 
shipped them to the Polish border and then the 
second transport was in Oc
tober, I think of ™41, 
it went to Litzma nnstadt, we l
earned later on. And ours was a second transport from Ha mburg 
and we were the fi rst transport th
at arrived in Minsk. And then 
another transport came later and 
we saw 500 people from Bremen and Ha mbur
g together, 500 fr om Bremen and 500 from 
Ha mburg. 
 

Q: This is a question you probably can answer fr
om i nfor mation afterwards.  I™m sure you didn™t 
know this then.  Do you know why they sent thes
e people to Minsk?  Wa s there a reason that 
your transport went to Minsk and not some where in Poland? 
 

A: No, you see the Germans, I read from this book here from Mr. Kohl, the Germans heard that the 
cities in Poland and Russia, they figured the Jews
 would be put there in the beginning. It was no 
idea of killing them i mmediately,
 they wanted the Jews to work, and because they couldn™t send 
all these people now to one spot.They distribut
ed them among different cities.  Litmanstadt, 
Riga, Lithuania, Minsk, a lot of 
cities. You see, the transport went from all parts of Germany 
and Czechoslovakia andVi enna and to Litzma nnstadt
, to the Ea st. The trains were running all 
the time . We  were only one transport.  Our luck
 was that we were the fi rst transport that came 
to Minsk and was unloaded.  Because  only the firs
t seve n transports in Mi nsk were unloaded.  
The other 28 were gassed on arrival. 
 

Q: They went straight to the gas chambers? 

 

A: There were no gas chambers. Mi
nsk didn™t have a gas chamber. 
 Minsk, they would bring these 
people from the railroad station in moving va
ns, which were ___ with a chimney and windows 
painted on it and they said we bring you to our
 farms to work here. And the mi nute all the 
people were pushed in, ma ybe 100 or 200 people, I 
wasn™t  there, but I read in the book, they 
would close these big doors and th
e exhaust pipe would run, this 
was the fi rst experiment with 
gas and they would bring them to about 8 or 10 kilome ters out of Minsk and by the time they 

got there the people were dead.  It took one hour, 
one hour and a half for th
e people to die. And 
then later on they started with different type of
 gas.  In Minsk was actua
lly the experiment with 

gas.  St arted in Minsk. 
 
Q: And this was like carbon monoxide? 

 

Aﬂ We  were the first transport 
to arrive. When we arrived th
e Germans had just killed 30,000 
Russian Jews to make space for the German Jews. 
 

Q: InMinsk? 

 

A: In Minsk. When we arrived the bodies were st
ill there.  Not all of 
them, but in the houses. 
 

Q: This was November still? 

 

A: We  arrived, we travel
ed three or four days. 
 

Q: Can you describe the train trip? 

 

A: Our train were old passenger cars, not new ones. 

 

Q: They weren™t cattle cars, they had seats?  

 

A: No cattle cars, they had seats, toilet, everybody 
had a seat and, now let me  go before when we 
came to the point where we had to, where all the 
thousand people had to report. The SS would 
first look at your passport pictur
e, or your ID card and rip it 
up then you were to open your 
wallet because you were only permitted to one hundred ma rks with you, then you had to give 

them all the jewelry you had, including your we
dding band, you had no othe
r jewelry because it 
had been already confiscated, and then you had to
 sign a paper that I, the Jew Heinz Rosenberg, 
will be deported because I am an enemy of the fa therland. 
 

Q: You had to write this out? 

 

A: No, no, it was already wr itten, we had to sign it. 
And, one more thing I forgot, then you got in 
and it was a tremendous hall or house, an old Jewi
sh lot, it was a community house, and there 

were already ma ny, the mood was 
not bad, because they said, well finally we get there where 
we will work and after the war we will come  home
.  People just coul d not understand.  It™s the 
same  as they would take today one hundred 
thousandAmerican people from Queens and say, 
you™re going on a little vacation.  Normal person cannot understand.  But some  people 

committed suicide. 
 

Q: Some  people did?  There? 

 

A: Not there, in their homes . There were about
 30 people and therefore my
 girlfriend, Erica could 
come  because she was on the list.  But because  30 people didn™t  show up, she was permitted to 

go there.  It had to be thousand people, Germans ar
e exact, they have to be exact. We left the 
next morning, at the Jewish Community in Ham
burg delivered soup and the Jewish leader in 
Ha mburg told us, don™t worry you go to work and we
 loaded the cars with sewing ma c hines and 
equipment for you, and with food and you will be  we
ll taken care of, I have
 the guarantee from 
the SS and so on. Where will you go, we go to the East. We ll it took four  days and when we 

arrived in Minsk in the evening we were su
rrounded by very heavy SS guard. We  were not 

permitted to get out, it was November, but we sa
w across the our trai n a train with Russian 
prisoners, in open cattle cars, a
nd we saw how one or two German soldiers would throw in one 
bread in each car and these peopl
e were starved to death , woul
d start fighting and the mi nute 
they would st art fighting, then SS said mutiny 
and would take  their machine guns and Brrrrrrr.  

It was the first impression for me .And then 
the next morning, now I was ma de a so- called 
runner from car to car with a yellow ri
bbon because there had to be some  kind of 
communication when we stopped.- We  stopped three or four times on the way.  Some people 

got sick, we had no doctor, but we had a nurse w
ith us, a Jewish nurse.  It had to be some body 
who could run fast and I was very young.  So I 
had a much be tter idea what was going on in the 

different trains.  I was only with two more 
people, we could go from outside, the SS would 
open the door, and we would try to bring these 
people to the car where the nurse was. There 
was no me dical things there.  But when we got
 to Minsk, I was also 
there and Dr. Frank, who 
was the leader of the transport, a former Ger man officer, a lawyer, the ex-comma nder  of Minsk 

was standing there and said, wher
e is your leader from the tran
sport?   So Dr. Frank, who had 
one of these Spanish little things on his head, yo
u know, said Sir, and he saluted him I have one 
thousand Jews me n and wome n a
nd children from Ha mburg and th
at was the first impression, 
then that SS ma n took his whip and ﬁslapﬂ to 
his face and he fe ll down. You dirty Jew when 
you speak to an SS ma n, take your hat off. You 
se e, that was the first impr ession of Minsk.  
And then, you want to conti
nue, or is that too far? 
 

Q: No, no go ahead. 

 

A: And then we had to go to the ghetto of Minsk. 

 

Q: So there is already a 
ghetto established there? 
 
A: From the Russian Jews. 
 

Q: You said some thing about when you got there that they ha d to kill ma ny Russian Jews? 

 

A: We  didn™t know that. When we got there 
the SS people taught us we walked, cold. 
 

Q: This was November? 

 

A: Cold and ma ny old people couldn™t ma ke it up the 
hill. I remember this. And we got there and 
we saw this red house, this used to be a former
 school and the white house, also a school, is for 
you. The red is not for you.  So we got into
 these houses, Dr. Frank and the first young ma n, 
because the others took much longer time to get th
ere, the food was still on the tabl e, whatever 

little food they had, these people were already 
pushed into the school buildings. The dead 
bodies were still there. 
 

Q: Insidethehouses? 

 

A: Inside the two houses.  So Dr. Frank said we ha
ve to clean up before we let the people in.  So 
we tried very hard to clean up. There were not 
that ma ny bodies, ma ybe thirty, forty. They had 
taken everybody away, these most probably were
 in hiding and when the SS went through the 
building saw them. And then we learned, it was 
a few days later, there was a big fence between 
the Russian and the German Jewish ghe
tto. The SS put a big fence there. 
 

Q: So you were kept apart from the Rus sians? 
 

A: They had built it to keep us separate. And 
when we came to the fe nce, fi rst we were not 
permitted to go to the fence, but later on you 
couldn™t always, you know the guards couldn™t be 
all over. They told us that thirty thousand Jews 
had been killed in the last three days to ma ke 
room for the German Je ws.  For theYe kkas (? ) they called us the ﬁYekkasﬂ. TheYe kkas is a 

typical German Jew.  So I didn™t speakYi ddish 
at that time , I spoke German and these people 
spokeYi ddish, so you had,Yi ddish is a turned 
around Germa n.  So we couldn™t touch them but 
we could talk to them at least. And we learne
d about the tragedies that
 every day there actions, 

every day there killings and 
there were about one hundred thousand Russian Jews, but every 
day they would kill some of them. We  didn™t be
lieve it.  My father said, come  on.  My father 
was typical law abiding citizen and they ma de Dr
. Frank the leader of th
e German part of the 
ghetto. About three days later the next trans
port came from Dusseldorf already and we didn™t 
know where to put these people. And two days 
later a transport fromFrankfurt, all with 
thousand people. And then the SS commander came and said well you can move into the small 

houses.These were not real houses, these were 
little from can you imagine in the country you 

have, where you go for the summer, a little summer
house.  It was not very big, with wood, and 

there was a stove inside and ti
ny rooms, you know, like this, but 
we did not have furniture and 
so on and it was cold.  But my fa mily and my mo
ther, father, and my sister, we move d together 
with other family, Blywise and Himmelstein to one of these little houses. Then after awhile, 

after about four weeks about seven or eight tr
ansports arrived all t
ogether and then the 
transports stopped. The last one came fromYa nof
. Then it stopped. And then we started to 
work, we were picked up in the morning by heavy guard, twenty me n, or twenty wome n.  I 

worked in the German soldiers homes.  I had a 
very good job, I mean, I had plenty to eat, much 
more than the people in the ghetto.  I was permitte
d every Sunday to visi t my fa mily.  SS guard 
would bring me and pick me up the next morn
ing.  But most comma
ndos only worked during 
the day and went home t o the ghetto at night. 
 But certain commandos stayed on the job because 
it was impossible to transport them 
ba ck and forth.  I was very luck
y, very lucky.  First I worked 
in the German hospital and the hospital was later 
made into a German home for soldiers so I 
compared to others and I was able to bring little
 things to my parent.  Some times extra soup, if I 
wasn™t  searched.  If you were searched and th
ey found some thing, they would (sound effect).  I 
came with an SS guard already and the guard woul
d look the other way they
 didn™t expect me  to 
bring anything in. That was about
 all together about eight mo nths. The officer in charge his 
name was Breimeier who for whatever cockeyed
 reason was very good to me, he killed other 
Jews, but I was his pet for whatever reason.  
These people we re abnorma l , abnorma l people.  
And there™s another interesting stor
y, if you want to hear it.  One day he told me , he said, Heinz, 
tomorrow morning we expect some  German artists 
to entertain the troops 
and I want you to help 
them with the luggage.   So when I went up th
ere this one German man said to me  how come  
you speak such a perfect German, are you a  Russian Jew?   I said no, I am a Ger man Jew, 

I™m from Gottinge n.  He said, from Gottinge n, __
____ and this was a girlfriend of my sister ™s, 
they went to school toge ther.  So I said, Sir,
 I™m sorry I cannot talk to you because I am a 
prisoner here.  Come  on, how can you be a prisoner
, then he saw the Jewish St ar and the big 
cross (?) here. 
 

 

 Side 2,Ta pe 1 
 

 He didn™t believe it. And she was the first 
one who taught me . (blank space on tape at this 
point) She said, I have heard and been told by SS 
people that this camp will be eliminated.  She 

knew already. 
 
Q: And this was still in ™41?  

 

A: ™42. This was in ™42, that™s  why I bring 
it up. They knew already that the camp woul d be 
eliminated.  Now in summer of ™42, was anothe
r big action where thirty
 thousand Jews were 
killed in three days. 
 

Q: These were mostly Soviet Jews? 

 

A: German Jews too. They killed all theVi enne
se, all the Czech Jews, a
ll the Frankfurt Jews, all 
the, there we re only about two thousand or thr
ee thousand people left from the German Jews. 
 

Q: You said you were working at this hospital and 
then became a German soldiers home. What did 
you do there? 
 

A: I was in the steam room. 

 

Q: You were in the steam room, you cleaned up? 

 

A: No, no, we had to heat the place.  But not with co
al or oil but withToff, what is toff, something 
that burns very fast, you know when the trees 
decompose it becomes like 
(sound effect) this is a 
tremendous building so you had to focus there. We  were a twenty-four hour shift. They 

brought in wood too, but it was very hard work.  
We  had two shifts, two me n each, to heat the 
big place. 
 
Q: Again who was the person who told you 
they were going to eliminate the camp?  
 

A: She was a German girl from Gottingen. 

 

Q: What was she doing there, was she Jewish? 

 

A: No, no.  She was an actress. The actors cam
e like here you have theAme r ican troops are 
entertained. 
 

Q: Oh, like the USO?  

 

A: The same  thing. The Germans did the same .  
She  came with this group to Minsk and because I 
worked in the Soldiers Home 
that™s where they performe d. 
 

Q: And she knew your sister? 

 

A: She went to school together.  She was our best
 friends in Gottingen as
 little children.  She knew 
my fa mily, she knew my  home . All coincidence in life, you know.  But she was the first one 

who told me  that this camp would be
 destroyed. And nobody believed us, you know. 
 

Q: You said in the summer?  

 

A: Then came 1942, they killed every day, 100 peopl
e, 50 people, 10 people of the Russian Jews.  

But then in July 1942 there was a ma ss action wh
ere we who were outside on commandos could 
not go back to the ghetto. Three days. And they 
killed thirty five thousand Jews in three days. 
 
Q: Do you know what me thod they used to do this, were they gassing them? 

 

A: Whatever they could transport with their gasvans, they would transport them out. The people 
had to stand in line and waited to
 be loaded and the others they
 would shoot them. They also 
brought these people to, this is 
interesting in the book from Mr
. Kohl, he describes exactly 
where the killings took pl ace. These people had to
 lay down, not only just jump into the graves 
they were digged before, but they had to lay down 
orderly, one with the head here, the other one 

with the head there, so it w
ould take less space. Then the 
soldiers would come  with the 
machine guns and Brrrrrr. Then the next people– 
 

Q: So they shot them when they were on the ground? 

 

A: In the grave. 

 

Q: So they ma de them dig the grave? 

 

A: No, they were digged before.  Other prisoners 
who were also killed and then when these people 
came they had to line up and they had to jump in
to the grave, but not just anyway you wanted it, 
no one had to lay this way a
nd the other one this way. 
 

Q: And then they shot th
em after they lay down? 
 

A: The first layer and then the next layer had to jump in. 
 
Q: Was this in the ghetto? 

 

A: No, this was outside. 

 

Q: Where they took them out to the woods? 

 

A: Ye s, they were in a so- called farm.-  I have the name s in the book from Mr. Kohl if you need 
the name s, I give you the name s. Thi s  book is fa
ntastic because we didn™t know these things.  I 
only learned about these deta
ils now from this book from this German reporter. 
 

Q: This book is in German? 

 

A: Ye s in German. A fantastic book an unbelievable book. 

 

Q: I would like to look at it. 

 

A: This is unbelievable. 

 

Q: Did you know, did you see these peop
le. You were not in the ghetto? 
 

A: I was in the Soldiers home. 

 

Q: So did you know when you came back what had happened? 
 

A: No, no. We  knew from t he Russian people who 
worked in the Soldiers home . They came in 
and could not look into my eyes, the Russian pe
ople.  I worked together with Russian people 
too.  I asked them. 
 

Q: Thesewerenon-Jews? 

 

A: Non-Jews.  I asked them what is happening?   
And some  spoke German and they said nisht goot.  
nisht goot, __________ ghetto kaput.  So for three da
ys.  But Breime ier, my Ger man officer in 
charge, I had to go every night and bring his beer
 from the canteen, as a Jew I had to go to the 
German sol diers™ canteen and say ﬁdas beer bi tta 
for officer Breime ier.ﬂ They knew me already.  
Everybody looked at me , here come s the Jew.  He liked me  because hi s wife was saved by 

Jewish doctors.  He killed other __________ because he had two potatoes (? )You know, these 

people you couldn™t explain it you know.  For example, when _______ came she ca me back 

after two weeks and I said to her when she le
ft, she said what can I do for you?   I said, you 
know, I would love to send a note to
 my aunt in Ha mburg, who is st
ill there.  Certainly, Heinz, 
certainly. When she came back I did not know. There again was all the SS staff standing there 

on the Soldiers™ Home .All these SS people wanted to
 have affairs with the German girls. And 
she looked out of the bus who rode in and I wa
s standing there with Breime ier, I was supposed 
to, she said Heinz Rosenberg, I have a package 
for you from Ha mburg. That would have been 
automa tically death penalty. Any communication was death penalty. The SS most probably 

didn™t hear or  they di dn™t know because there we
re German soldiers standing there and others, 
Heinz Rosenberg could also be a German.  Bu
t Breime ier he looked at me , he didn™t say 
anything.  But at night when he called, I had to be
 up there every night at 
6 0™clock to bring his 
beer, he said I want to talk to you.  I said what 
happened, sir.  I had to address him as sir.What 
was that with a package?  What package, I sai
d. He said, come  on don™t give me  that story. He 
was a ma n of about 45. He said this lady called ou
t.  I said, well, what can I tell you sir, she 
offered to send a note to my aunt in Ha mburg.  I 
tell you one thing, if you 
want to have anything 
written or done, you come  to me , don™t go to 
strangers. You couldn™t ma ke these people out 
because he could have said at the same  mi nute 
ﬁbang outﬂ.  It meant nothing.  So, I was his pet 
for whatever cockeyed reason, I cannot tell you why.
  He would sit and drink his beer and tell 
me  you know, my wi fe, she was helped by this 
Jew doctor, what a beautiful person.  I have 
nothing against the Jews , but he kills them, you know. You can™t  ma ke them out.  So t hat 

__________ I me t her again after the war in Berlin.  
She died of cancer, unfortunately.  She was 
a hero, you see. 
 

Q: Youme t? 

 

A: Lila _______ when I went to Germany the first time . 

 

Q: The woma n who helped you send the package? 

 

A: Ye s, she died. So this was May.  So
 we had this action in July, I think, 26
th
 or 29
th
 where they 
killed thirty-five thousand Jews in one clip. 
 

Q: Now can you tell me , you were talking about 
this ma n who was, you worked for and got beer 
for and everything.We r e  German Jews treated differently than Russian Jews? 
 

A: No, you see, what it was, and this I read also
 in the book here from th
is Kohl, that F commander 
ofWhite Russia General Kula or whatever, I gi
ve you the name , he has the biggest fight with 
Berlin because he said I don™t 
want anything to happen to the German Je ws.  I don™t mi nd if you 
kill all the Russian Jews, but the German Jews 
ar e good people, they work, they™re qualified, I 
want to keep them. And he was overruled by 
the German high command.  Either you do it or 
you™re out. So he had no choice.  But he was in 
the beginning fighting for,
 as a ma tter of fact, 
there is one German Jew who was in the war with
 the Kaiser ™s son and he was sent back to 
Germany and I have his book here, ﬁOne Ger man 
Jewﬂ.And this SS ma n went to him in person 
and said, look, you™re the only one.  I will ma ke 
a personal request from Hi tler that you will and 
he was sent toTheresienstadt.  So you see that
 SS he was later blown 
up by the Party friends of 
Russia. Because he hated the Russian Jews.  He
 hated the Russians. But for some  other reason 
he thought he wanted to save the German Jews, 
he wanted to send them back after the war. 
 

Qﬂ Did you see some  of this like this treatment in Minsk? 

 

A: Oh, no. You have to understand something.  
Wh en we came to Minsk, you have to understand 
the German Jews basically were much softer than
 the Russian Jews or Polish Jews because they 
lived a much harder life already,. 
 

Q: Soft, you mean physically? 

 

A: Physically, more, better home s,
 better life, all lawyers, all doc
tors, all businessmen. Jews who 
lived in Poland, Lithuania, Russia were locksmith
s or carpenters, they had more trades. And 
they could live more easily from wha t  they ha
d.  Unfortunately, the German Jews in a certain 
way, especially theWe stern Jews, were already mu
ch more used to the easier life. That™s why 
they died easier too, and faster. 
They couldn™t take the cold, th
ey couldn™t take the snow, they 
couldn™t take  the hardships of life. The Russi
an Je ws wouldn™t have died if Hitler wouldn™t 

have killed them. And the German Jews wouldn™
t have died either, not all of them, if Hitler 
hadn™t killed them.  But the German J e ws and the 
French Jews and theVi ennese, especially, or 
the Czechs, they were much softer, it™s the sa
me here. A man from ParkAvenue will not 

survive than a man from Harlem.  It™s not
hing against the Jews from other parts, you 
understand, I love anybody, I only bring it out that we
 were not used to thirty below zero. They 
lived there, it was nothing for them. They we
re _______servants in the morning and my father 
was dying little by little. 
 

Q: After July 1942? 

 

A: There were two more actions. 

 

Q: Two more actions, when were they? 

 

A: Icannotremember. 

 

Q: Wa s this the first large action, large scale action? 

 

A: This was the last, after we  arrived, they had ki
lled at that time thirty-five thousand.This time 
they killed thirty-five thousand German,Vi enne
se, Czech and Russian Jews.  From the so-
calledWonder ghetto, we were in the Sunder whic
h was called the Extra 
ghetto, Sunder is Extra 
ghetto.They eliminated one part. 

 
Q: Of your ghetto? 

 

A: Of our so-called German ghetto of seven thousand people. And after 
this action everybody had 
to move to the part where the Hamburg, Bremen 
and Frankfurt Jews used to be, the people from 
Dusseldorf, I don™t reme mber which ones. And the 
others were closed already. And there only 
were some  s urvivors, and some  of them went  crazy, some  of them just couldn™t understand, 

there was nobody left when they came from work. The whole fa milies completely wiped out, 

you go out, you say goodbye, you come  back and there is nothing left. 
 

Q: Your fa mily was still there? 

 

A: My fa mily, we lived in the Ha mburg part. We  
were lucky.  My fa mily was still alive when I 
left.  I was very lucky, I tell you honestly.  Bu
t I was also very young, very strong, I could lift a 
horse by my self, you see. 
 

Q: So what happened after this?  This first large scale? 

 

A: They were every day.  Mr. Gruber, the SS co
mma nder of Minsk, Mr. Gruber, he was not all over 
in charge, but he was the one in charge of th
e ghetto.  Every day he would take five or ten 
people or one with more children and send them 
to death.  He would kill them himself on the 

cemetery. We  didn™t know, because if you were there I wouldn™t be here. 
 

Q: But did you know people were leaving, nobody 
knew people were dying except for family 
me mbers every day lie that? 
 
A: You saw it, you saw it.You just couldn™t do anything. He would go through with the Latvian SS 
men and just say you come with me. 
 
Q: Whoever they found on the street? 

 

A: Whatever reason, if they would find them on the fence, or they would find them, --- One day 
there was a beautiful girl who worked together
 with my brother, Marion Ba rrow and she had 
painted, she was a painter, a sign painter, new 
sign, Largo ____ a beautiful sign. Wh o ma de this 
beautiful sign?   So, at that time  we had alrea
dy the third Jewish ma n in charge of the ghetto, 
two were killed already and he said oh that
 was Marion Barrow (?)  He said why don™t you call 

her. This is very nice. And he called her, and 
took her to the cemetery and killed her. And now 
when I was in Ha mburg I me t the daughter of her 
sister who lived in Israel and the sister had 
died a week before we came  and she wanted to k
now the story.And it™s very hard for me  to tell 
a fa mily me mber what happened. There were
 two more actions.  I don™t know, the Russian 
ghetto actions were every day, and our ghetto th
ere were two more actions, I think, I cannot tell 
you the amount of people that were killed.  
But I only know one thing, that on September 1, 
1943, there were only two thousand five hundred Ge
rman Je ws left and about the same amount 

of Russian Jews. That was from a ca mp of one
 hundred and thirty fi
ve thousand me n, wome n 
and children. Within two years they had killed
 about one hundred and th
irty thousand people.  
We ™ll have to ma ke it short, otherwise we™ll never come  to an end. 
 

Q: You said there were two other actions?  They
 would be between July ™42 and September ™43? 
 

A: Ye s, every day were actions.  Gas ones came in all the time. 
 

Q: You never did any of these gas vans? We re they all staffed by the SS? 

 

A: No, no. You see the vans would come in a
nd the people were forced
 to jump into them. 
 

Q: Did these people know what these vans would do? 

 

A: Of course they knew, by now it wasn™t  the begi
nning. The people who arrived in the transports, 
they saw these big moving vans with the chimneys. And the SS didn™t threaten them, they were 

very nice, they said you know we bring you to our 
farms, because they have been told that if 
you are nice to people they will 
listen to you. And they are there to undress and they said we 
are going out to a thing and by the time they got 
there they we re already dead.   September 1, 
1943, the ghetto, our German ghetto was completely surrounded by SS during the night. 
 

Q: So we™re talking, was there still a division be
tween Russian and German J e ws at this point? 
 

A: Ye s, there wa s always.  Heavy guards. We  
knew some thing was going on. 
 It was 5 o™clock in 
the morning. And then Gruber gave order that a
ll Jews had to assemble in one open place we 
had there in a ____Platz (? ) that 
is a place to and he said all h
ealthy me n step forward and he 
sent back my father who was already old, and othe
r old me n he sent back.  But left were about 
250 people. 
 

Q: Who stepped out? 

 

A: He put them separate and he said, I give 
you exactly half an hour, pack a small knapsack, you 
go on a  special work commando.  Nothing will ha ppen to you, you will be  treated very well 

and say goodbye to your fa mily, but you will come  back and there is no problem. 
 

 

Q: What happened after that? 

 

A: So after half an hour we said goodbye and very
 heavy SS guard came.  
I™ve never seen  more 
SS people in my whole life.  
We  were 250 me n, there must have been 100 SS people with 
machine guns, everything and we were ma rched out of the ghetto to a small ca mp which 

recently used to be a prisoner of war camp for the 
Russian prisoners. A small camp in the city.  
I didn™t know the name , we didn™t know it existed. We  didn™t know anything because we 

couldn™t walk around. There was four barracks, ac
tually barracks for horses, and there were 
already some people there, some  Jews. They said
 we come from Smolensk. And we got in and 
there was another SS commander. We  were only 
borders to them. And he said, well you will 
be here until your transport l
eaves. We  asked where are we 
going?   I do not know, I cannot tell 
you, you will get food and if you behave properly nothing will happen to you. And one person 

ma de a question, I don™t know what he asked, what
 about our wives?   I tell you about your wife, 
he took his gun and bang. 
 

Q: And shot him?  

 

A: Ye s.You see. So, we were there, there wa
s no straw, no nothing.  Bare wood.  Of course, we 
were worried and we didn™t know what to do. We  could ______ soup.  It was a small place, we 

were 500 prisoners and these people from Smolensk
 told us that the ghetto in Smolensk has 
been closed.These were the last 
people they took out.  Come  on, this
 cannot be. Ye s, he said.  
Over the two years and then we realized this tim
e it will happen to our 
people.  But after three 
days, Mr. Gruber, the SS commander came and sad I have very good news for you, you can 
each write a note to your loved ones 
in the ghetto, and if you have wives, if they want to join 
you, they will be permitted to join you here.  So 
I wrote to my fa mily, a small pi ece of paper we 
had, we got, we didn™t ha ve it and the pencil, I wrote I do not want Erika to come  because this 

to me  looks very bad.  I wrote in French a
nd English, because  I s
poke a little English and 
French at that time  because we didn™t figure if 
they would read it. And two days later I got a 
letter back from home fr om my fa mi ly and Eri
ca. And Erica wrote, I am comi ng together with 
Hannah Lou™s sister who was ma rried to Herm
an Haupman who lives now. We are comi ng. 
And honestly, after six days about 50 wome n arri
ved all from the ma rried me n. Also with the 
little knapsack. And we said it cannot be so 
bad if they permit the wome n here.  Maybe nothing 
to eat, probably, ma ybe nothing to sleep probably. 
 But when you are in such a state, just to 
have some body is already comforting.  
And that went on until September 14. 
 

Q: So you were there two weeks? 

 

A: With a wife.  

 

Q: So Erika came , she was there? 

 

A: Yeah. And very early, on September 14, 1943, the SS comma nder of this camp told us to get 
ready for transport.  It was 5 in the morning. We
 all packed our little bag what we had, we went 
up we were not permitted to take anything with 
us, the me n and the wome n. And he said the 
me n to the left and the wome n to the right. And he said, first we bring the me n to the railroad 
and then the wome n so you can prepare already at
 least. And again unde
r very heavy guards we 
were taken to the railroad. That™s the last  tim
e I saw Erika or my parents. The wome n never 
came. 
 
Q: They never came with you? 

 

A: Never.  But when we we nt thr
ough the cities of Minsk with this 
transporter, it was an SS van or 
whatever it was, we passed the ghetto.And they 
must have heard some thing or seen and I saw 
the people still st andi ng in the ghetto and greeting us. We  couldn™t see them in person, but I 

saw them sa ying hello.  I don™t know if my parents 
were there or not, you couldn™t look that far.  
So the ghetto was still alive on September 14, 1943, 2,500 people there. If the Russian Jews 

were still there, I do not 
know. We  didn™t pass by there. And we
 were taken to a cattle car now.  
No heat, no straw, nothing, no food. 
 

Q: Theydidn™tgive 
you any water either? 
 

A: Nothing.  I think we were in the transport tw
o or three days.  I honest
ly can™t reme mbe r  right 
now. The doors were never opened. They gave
 us one little pear, but you know a hundred 
people in a car that pear we
nt over right away, you know. And then we stopped, we couldn™t 
look out, but all night long they would move th
at car back and forth, 
like a football, you know, 
the people got completely, what should I say, it wa s abnorma l, you know, you were pushed back 

and forth by tremendous force. They  would 
(sound effect) and push. Then early in the 
morning the SS opened these cattle car doors and 
they were standing there with the German 

shepherds and with the kapos and they shouted
 ﬁGet out you dirty Jews
, get out, run, run, run, 
get out, get out, run.ﬂAnd we saw a gate and it sa
idTr eblinka. And it said ﬁArbeit Mach Frei, 
the work will ma ke you free.ﬂ 
 
Q: And this was the mi ddle of September? 

 

A: This was probably the 17
th
 or 18
th
 of September, 1943. And we came to this camp, we had to 
run.  It was a terrible sweet smell. A terrible
 sme ll. We  didn™t know whatTr eblinka wa s, we 
had no idea. And we saw prisoners pulling tr
emendous loads, a wagon with shoes and with 
clothes. And we were put separate on one 
spot, the 200, some had died, I don™t reme mber how 
ma ny made it or not. About 240 mos t  probably. 
And there were kapos and there were Dutch 
Jews and they told us where you from?   I said 
we™re from Minsk. They said this is the ______ 
commando that meant this is the comma ndo to he av
en.  I said what ar
e you talking about?   
We ll, you will see, this is the comma ndo to h
eaven.  Do you have anythi ng good with you?  I 
said why?   I need this. You don™t need it anymore. They were one hundred per cent sure, these 

kapos, we would be gassed too.  So after a while
, we were standing ther
e about three hours, not 
permitted to go to the toilet, ther e were no toilets. After three hours an SS delegation came and 

said, are there any carpenters 
here? Yes, three ca
rpenters. Any locksmiths?  Ye s. Any 
plumbers?  Ye s. Any electricians? Ye s.  Get 
out, get out, get out. And I, my friend Herman 
Hoff ma n wa s an electrician, he said to me , if 
they ask for locksmith next time , get out too.  
Locksmith?  Ye s.  I knew about it, I was in th
e steam room.  I  got out too. We took Otto 
Menkin with us and Herman and about hundred peopl
e went out. And they said are there any 
gardeners?  Ye s. Everybody went as a gardener. 
The gardeners we never saw again.  But we 
were pushed on the side and we 
went to a barrack and we had to undress. We  had still not 
prison uniforms but we had old clothes ma rked w
ith ___.  So we had to undress. The little  
thing we had, here, here, here.  Nothing. We  were
 searched from top to bottom. Then we went 
into a shower room. We  didn™t know what it was.
 And we got out and then we came to a room 
where they gave us each one a new uniform and 
wooden shoes or some thing like this and then 
they said you will stay he re and 
you will be transported to Deshov.  
So the kapos said to us, that 
kapos, you are the first group that came  in and goes out of here alive.  So we still didn™t know 

whatTr eblinka was. I never heard aboutTr eblin
ka before, you know.  But we heard the smell 
and he said this is a death factory.  But you 
know, even getting from the ghetto in Minsk, even 
seeing everything, we didn™t know what a deat
h factory was, you know. We  didn™t know, we 

didn™t know.  So in the evening they put us back
 on a cattle car to Puchine which wasn™t  too far 
away.  Because the next  morning we got there.
 In Puchine was a work camp, a concentration 
work camp, a very small camp. And we worked fo
r the Heinkel factory. This was taken over 
by the, this used to be Polish airplane factor
y, taken over by the Germans and we got there was 
a small camp and this camp wa s, there were about 250 Polish Jews and wome n there. And just 

before we got there, the SS had executed allthe children there by beheading them. And the 

grave, you know the mot hers and fathers had to 
watch, there were about 
fifty children.  So we 
got there, the Polish Jews did not like the Germ
an Jews, they called us theYe kkas. There was 
always friction, but they were in comma nd. And we
 were put to work there in Puchine in one 
camp and then the next camp. This lasted abou
t, I would think, four or six months.  I can™t 
reme mber I have to look it up in my book.  If you wait a mi nute I can get it.You want me  to 

ma ke sure of the dates? 
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: It was from September 17 toApril 21, 1944, 
in Puchine.  Puchine was then closed down 

because the Russians came  already near, you see,
 and we were shippe d to another work camp 
called Scechochw, and this was fromApril to July in 1944. These were all work camps for the 
Heinkel factory.  But the Russians came  closer 
again and when the train left the machine guns 
hit the last car of the train, but they got the 
Jews out. You see we were one hundred per cent 
sure that we would be liberated, but they got us 
out just before they got there. As a matter of 
fact the SS commander, two or three Polish Jews
 escaped that night or
 ten people.  In the 
morning we thought we would all be kille
d, there was already machine guns around. 
 

Q: Because they had escaped? 

 

A: Ye s.  He said how ma ny escaped?  Te n, that™s
 all, I thought more.  He has no guts, you know, he 
was already sick and tired of this, you know. 
 

Q: Now what did you do in the first work camp in Puchine? 

 

A: We  worked. I worked as a locksmith.  I don™t remember exactly what I di d.  Because I was very 
strong at the end.  First we had to transport in 
the beginning this was a work force to repair the 
tanks and we  have to move these things and 
the equipment and, of course, they took the young 

men to move these things. And only later on did they
 try to put us really in places to work.  But 
nothing was ever accomp lished ther
e, nothing.  No airplane ever 
left there.  But these were 
small concentration work camps, you understand. They had SS guards and the SS commandos.  

But in general you worked from 6-6 but you got 
soup, proper soup at night and a slice of bread, 
and because the camp became s maller, it was ba d enough.  But we got ____ in Deshov. They 

took us to a public bath every four weeks.  
The HeinkelWork insisted that the prisoner 
shouldn™t have lice. They paid for us.  I think th
ey paid fifty pfenigs a day for us or some thing 
like that.  Puchine went to September and Deshov 
went fromApril to July 1944. And that also 
had to be closed down because the Russians came. 
 

Q: And where did you go after that? 

 

A: And then we were taken to a big ca mp n
ear Krakow called Plaszow, which was built on the 
for mer Jewish cemetery.  It was mostly wome
n camp. Wo me n were there.  Jewish wome n.  
This was a tremendous camp, one of the worst 
camps. That commande
r, SS commander, only 
walked around in a white silk suit. And he 
would kill the wo me n like nothing. We  had one 
latrine. You know what a latrine is?  Wo me n 
and me n together. There was no difference.  
Absolutely no difference. And we finally, 
some body put a wooden plank in between us. And 
we had very very bad kapos there and SS peopl
e too. But we were only there a few days.  
Because by now we were so called _____ expert work
ers.  So from Plaszow, after five days, we 
were sent to the salt mi nes inWi eliczka, but th
ey did not put us to work but it was the worst 
camp, I think because everythi ng was dirt, you know
 from the salt and from the prisoners who 
worked there, never ma de it more than four to
 six weeks, they told us. And because they 
couldn™t use us there, they sent us to a tr
emendous German concentration camp in Bavaria 
called Flossenberg, a big camp, a ve ry big camp. That was inAugust of ™44. And there the SS 

commandant when we came in he asked, we were very dirty and in a long transport for the day, 

he asked, the kapos, where do thes
e prisoners come from?  And th
e kapos said they are Jews.  
He said Jews ?   Jews only walk in, they go out
 in the chimney.This was a tremendous camp, 
very clean, very orderly, but terrible kapos.  
The German kapos hated us. The Polish kapos, you 
know. And we were put, just to give you an exam
ple, where to undress, this was high in the 
mountains, we had to undress, we had to run in
to a shower and this 
was originally the gas 

chamber, and the kapos said that™s it.
 And we didn™t know what would happen. 
 
Q: The kapos said you would die? 

 

A: Ye s, because it was a gas chamber.  But they also had water faucets there on the ceiling.  But in 
our case, the boiling water came out and you couldn™t move anywhere, we came out like 

lobsters into the ice cold weathe
r, but we got out. And the kapo
s didn™t believe it. I only give 
happy thoughts because I couldn™t tell you the wholething, you can read everythi ng here.  So in 

Flossenberg, after about three week
s, we were not put to work, we
 were put in into a special 
barracks for Jews. There were no other Jews. There was a camp of about  twenty thousand 

prisoners. 
 

Q: Mostly they were political prisoners? 

 

A: Political, Galitziana, homosexuals, no Jews.We  
were the fi rst Jews that  came in and the fi rst 
Jews that go out.  But what happened in Flossenber
g, it™s  an interesting story.  One day they put 
out of the 250 me n were not all German Jews, 
they were Russian Jews,  Polish Jews, but now 
there ma y be 200 left.  One morning they called, 
all German Jews to the barracksA. That was 

where the commanding was sitting.  Hands up, and we
 figured that™s  it, we didn™t know what to 
ma ke out of it. And all of a sudden some body pus
hed me and said, Jew, come inside. There 
was no dead ma n, or the SS ma n or the typewrit
er and he asked, your name ?   I said Heinz 
Ludwig Rosenberg.  Idiot, you are He inz Ludwig Israel Rosenberg. Ye s sir. Where you born?   

So and so. Where your parents? 
What™s  your nationality?   I sa
id I am stateless. You are 
German. All of a sudden I am Ger man again.  
You never knew where to take these people.  
What did you learn, what did you do, and so and so
?  Wr ote everything down.  Out!  Next one.  
I tell you why this is important to tail this onthe end of this.  Everybody, German Jews were 
registered. Why?   Don™t ask me .  It was 
Rosenberg. Then, about three weeks later one 
morning, they said Block, everything with loud 
speakers, Block 420 or whatever our block was, 
you do not go to work, you report to the gate. A
nd the kapos hated the Jews, he said good, get 
rid of you Jews. And the gate is a real commande
r today, out. We  each got a piece of bread and 
a piece of liverwurst. And we™re standing and standi
ng.  I was so hungry I ate, 
little, little, little, 
and 5 o™clock the SS ma n came with a big basket
 to collect the wurst and bread because the 
railroad didn™t  come . And some body said I don™t ha
ve it.  Don™t have it, stand out.  So when he 
came to me I said sergeant, I ate mi ne I was 
so hungry. Why do you speak such good German?   
I was born in Ha mburg.  Next one.  He didn™t 
do anything to me .  Some how, you know, there 
was all a ma tter of luck.  From Flossenberg we we
re transported to the other part of Germany, 
Col mar, which was in the French ________, in the mountains.  It was inAugust of ™44. And 
this transport was not guarded by SS me n, but by di
sabled German soldiers. And they told us, 
they left the gate doors open, and they said the war is over. 
 

Q: InAugust of ™44 they said this? 

 

A: They said, the war is over, that™s  the end of th
e war. What have you done 
that you are in prison?   
Because we had prison uniforms by now. We  said
 we are Jews.  Oh, don™t worry, it™s  all over.  

And they were basically not brutal with whips an
d so on. They were German soldiers. And we 
came to this little camp in Colmar wh
ich was a small ca mp, also prisoners. 
 

Q: So you went from Col ma r  inAugust of ™44, a 
couple days later to Ur
bis to dig the tunnel 
through– 

 
A: Not dig, not dig. To
 work in the tunnel. 
 

Q: To work inside the tunnel?  What
 we re you doing inside that tunnel? 
 

A: Tr ansport, the skier or the product for the Germans. 

 

Q: Do you know what they were doing there? 

 

A: I think they were building parts for the submar
ines.  I know the submarines were assembled in 
Bremen.  I worked there too. 
 

Q: And so then they transported you to Sachsenhausen?   

 

A: Yes. We were also again put in a specia
l ba rracks because we were the only Jews in 
Sachsenhausen. We  were next to the barrack 
of people who were condemned to die.  Every 
week they collected prisoners should die.  Ev
ery Saturday they had about 250 executions in 
Sachsenhausen. We  were next to it.  But you coul
d not talk to these people.  It was completely 
surrounded by wire, barbed wire, you know. You c
ouldn™t talk to them.  But we saw them.  

They were all shackled together, foot and things
 day and night. And they were permitted half 
an hour to ma rch around in their little extra things
. And they had crosses here and crosses here 
and crosses here, ready for death.  Every Satu
rday morning the truck would come  and throw 
these people on the trucks, the kapos, and that™s  it. 
And then they collect again. We  were in the 
next barrack and that™s  why we knew it. And in Sachsenhausen we were put to work.We  were 

put to work to dig out the houses that were bombed by the British or Ame r ican pl anes.  Heavy 

guards.  But we had to clean or dig or whatever we  had to do. 
 

Q: When you came to Sachsenhauser, when was that? 

 

A: October ™44. We  were about one mo nth in
 Sachsenhausen, or ma ybe six weeks, I don™t  
reme mber, I have to look it up.  Dates are hard to reme mber. 
 

 Ta pe 2, Side 1 
 

 When we came to Bre men we were unloaded near the harbor and we were put, not near the 
harbor, ma ybe an hour from where they build th
e submarines and these things, A small camp 
with a very cool SS commander who hanged some
 people there, every day they were hanging.  
I reme mber that especially. And every morning at
 5 0™clock we  were put on a little barge, ice 
cold, and we were brought to the place of work
 because it was an hour away. We  had to work 
there.  I worked as a plumber or a locksmith, 
I don™t reme mber what I did.  I can™t reme mber 
exactly what I did any more.  But I worked.  
And there were German me n who were the people 
who worked all the time  and we had to help them
. And some  of them we
re very nice and others 
would report your number to the SS and at nigh
t you came to the camp and they would call you 
out and you got twenty- five on your behind. You ne
ver knew when, you see.  So I only later on 
I was put in charge of the Jewish barrack
 and one day I came back from work, the SS 
commander told me  that he had found a knife in 
my barrack and I would get twenty five on my 
behind. And every ma n of the room got ten and 
every single Jew got one.  But I got twenty- 
five and you had to count. You didn™t count you 
got the whip.  It was given to me  by a Polish 
kapo, there were two Russians. They were the wo
rst Jew haters I ever see in my life. They 

were Russian prisoners.  Later on before this 
camp was liquidated, these two Russian prisoners 
were stoned to death by the other prisoners. A
nd when Bre men came to an end, we again went 
on transport and went to Bergen-B
elsen, the inferno of infernos. 
 
Q: Do you remember when 
you got to Bergen-Belsen? 

 

A: We  got to Bergen-Belsen approxi
ma tely the end of March, I think. 
 

Q: Of  ™45? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: So you were in Bremen from late ™44 to early ™45? 

 

A: Right.  Bremen was the worst I™ve seen besi
des Minsk. Thirty thousand dead bodies on the 
ground.  Only because I was still able to work 
we transpor ted, the Germans wanted to clean up 
that camp, a nd we had to transport the dead 
bodies, decomposed bodies, to the ma ss grave that 
day, and all of a sudden only _______ and you couldn™t 
get out of line, and my best friend Kurt 
Spitzkopf, with whom I went toge
ther all the time from Minsk, a
ll of a sudden, while we were, 
he said, Heinz, there™s my mother.  His mother
 was killed in Minsk.  I said, good, your mother 
is dead.  My mother is dead, 
my mother (sound effect of mach
ine gun), you couldn™t stop him.  
So most of the people from my 
commando died in Minsk.  But when we were liberated in 
Minsk we were about, I think 10 
people left from the 250 people. 
 

Q: You mean liberated Bergen-Belsen? 

 
A: Yeah,Bergen-Belsen. 
 

Q: When were you liberated? 

 

A: April 15, 1945.  I was 75 pounds, typhus, blood clot
,TB.  I only saw the British tank comi ng in 
and then I collapsed.  I was very very sick. 
 It took a year and a 
half to recuperate. 
 

Q: So you went to Sweden after the war? 

 

A: No, you see, then when the camp wa s liberated 
and the British came in  they didn™t know what 
to do with these people.  So firs
t they had to eliminate all the 
dead people and then they opened 
the SS barracks and the soldiers and they ma de 
temporary hospitals.We  were so sick.  Most 
people died. Te n thousand people died after libera
tion.  So I was lucky and they brought me  to 
this hospital.  My legs we re li
ke this, with blood clots, you know
.  But, one day a British doctor 
came and they called a ve ry expert and he said n
o, no, it™s not so bad he will live. That™s what I 
understood. But then one day the British came around about in May or the beginning of June 

and said there are transpor ts to
 Sweden, and we will put you on the transport.  So when they 
asked me  what is your nationality, I thought I woul
d be proud and say I am a Ger man Jew.  He 
said no German Jews be cause we don™t know if you™re a Jew or not.  I said I™m a Jew,  my na me  

is Rosenberg.  No, no.  So the next time  they 
came around I was a little smarter.  Said, what is 
your name  Uh, huh. What is your 
nationality?   St ateless?   Uh 
huh.  So they shipped me  to 
Sweden. 
 

Q: So they wouldn™t take German Jews to Sweden? 
 

A: No, no.  Not in the begi nning because they we
re not sure.You see they thought maybe these SS 
people, they couldn™t be sure.The Polish coul
d speak Polish, the French talked French, the 
Italians speak Italian. 
 I couldn™t speak.  My broken Eng
lish. Ve  vant bread, yah. You know, 
you see I didn™t know at that time.  So they t
ook us to Sweden.  I was unconscious, but when I 
came to Swe den I never forget that and I saw all 
these blond Swedish people, they all volunteer.  
Sweden took in 30,000 people. They emptied out the schools, the hospitals.  I don™t know how 

ma nyAmerica took in.  I don™t know how ma ny of
 Switzerland.  Nothing.  Switzerland took 
some and se nt them back to Germany.  But 
when I saw these nurses I thought this is the 

entrance to heaven. I thought rea
lly these long tents must be th
e entrance to heaven because I 
was conscious and unconscious. And these nur
ses looked at me  and they said Swedish 
language, look at the little boy here. They knew 
there was nothing here nothing there, 75 or 80 

pounds at that time .  But  what happened at Berg
en-Belsen, comi ng back to the registration in 
Flossenberg, my cousin,Albert 
Hottenberg just called, he wa
s a high officer under Eisenhower 
and he liberated Buchenwald and Dachau and wh
en he came to Flossenberg and he saw this. 
 

Q: He saw your name ?  

 

A: He looked for Rosenberg, he Heinz Rosenberg
 (sound effects) and it says Heinz Rosenberg 
shipped to here. And he traced me  to Sachse
nhausen and from Sachsenhausen he was able to 
Bremen and Bremen.  Not that he saw me  in pe
rson, but he knew I™m either dead in Bergen-
Belsen or alive.  So we were in these big rooms from the German soldiers.  I couldn™t walk.  I 

had diarrhea.  I couldn™t get out of bed.  So 
I heard some body shouting outside. Hey Rosenberg.  
But you know I couldn™t go to the window, nobody coul
d.  I come  toAmerica a couple of years 
later, I get in contact with my cousin, my other cousin saidAlbert  lives in Baltimore.  One day 
my wife and I go toWa s hington to see Otto and we
 go to Baltimore to see my cousinAlbert and 
he says Heinz, I don™t understand you were in 
Bergen-Belsen, didn™t you hear me  with a loud 
speaker in Bergen-Belsen.  I was very sick, I didn
™t  hear anybody.  I went there with an army 
jeep with threeAmerican soldiers with a big 
loud speaker calling for Heinz Rosenberg.  I would 
have taken you to Gottingen and ma de you the Ma yor
 of Gottingen.  Honestly that is what he 
wanted to do.  He was in command.  He had 
the whole district.  He was a high officer under 
Eisenhower, because he had jumped while stil
l the war was going on over Gottingen in German 
uniform.  He was a typical German.  My cousin
 is a good tall looking ma n, typical German.  He 
was German.  So, I didn™t meet him t here, but 
I met him here. And we are still very good 

friends.  But this othe r coincidence in life onl
y because the Germans took my card and file did 
he find me .  It™s  unbelievable.  
But you see, this here what I am
 giving you is all written here in 
this book, and I will gi ve  you a book. And, you see, it 
is very very impossible to expl ain all the 
cruelties and all the tragedies 
and all that went on in these 
camps because the norma l person 
cannot feel and understand what went on.  I happen to be a ma n who went through thirteen 

camps.  Someti mes I think I™m not really alive, 
it™s a dr eam that I am still here. I wasn™t  
supposed to live.  I was in front of machine guns
, I was in gas chambers, we were put out again 
in _______.You can read all this. To tell you my story is not important, but to tell you the story 

of the six million Jews and fourteen million Ru
ssians and Polish and other people who have 
been killed.  It is absolutely a necessity th
at the world should know what happened.  Only by 
knowing the facts can we  build a be tter world. If we don™t do it, the world will blow itself up.  

And I don™t care if you are a Jew or gentile, blac
k, white, yellow, whatever you are, I don™t care, 
I don™t mean you in person, the people you see. If th
e world doesn™t  realize that this hatred and 
this crime and this dirt has to stop, then they 
will destroy themselves. 
I am at the age, maybe 

I™m lucky, I have another fifteen years, it™s
 not so important.  Bu
t, for my children and 
grandchildren and for all the children and grandc
hildren in this world th
ere should be some  kind 
of more understanding from all th
e peoples to know what went 
on.  It™s  very hard to, you know, 
what should I tell you, how people starve to death,
 it wouldn™t ma ke sense. This you can read 
in books.  I can only tell you my story and my st ory 
is not important.  I am alive.  But the story 
of my parents, my sister, my first wife, all my
 friends, all the Jews from Hamburg, all the Jews 
from Minsk, all the peoples from all the other co
ncentration camps, they put them at the knife 
for punishment, in the trees gallows, they hanged them, in Bremen they hanged them, all over 

they gassed them.  I a m one of the few people 
who can talk about it. 
 I have a very good 
me mory.  I hold this book in order that pe
ople should know what went on, that™s  why I am 
willing to give you this book.  I didn™t  write it for 
myself, I know the stories, I was there.  But 
the people who were not there, they should lear
n from it, you see, otherwise we will destroy 
ourselves. This hatred has to stop so me where and 
there is still tremendous hatred in this world.  
Tr emendous  hatred and jealousy, wh
atever it is.  So I am trying to
 do my little part in order to 
bring a little bit of more understand
ing and peace to this world. Th
at the whole story.  I am an 
expert on concentrati
on camps, unfortunately. 
 

Q: You have been to more, I thi
nk, than anybody I™ve ev
er interviewed. 
 

A: I really some times honestly and truly ask my
self how come I am alive and everybody else 
didn™t ma ke it.  But it™s really
 like a little ______ going 
through all these big naps and then all 
of a sudden one or two or three people are left ov
er. We  are eighteen people, I give you the list 
of the German Jews who are still alive.  Some  died
 already.  One girl died now inAustralia last 
year.  Martin St ock died in Hamburg ma ny year
s ago.  So it™s getting less, you know. That™s 
why, we the witnesses, it™s very important, a
nd I hope that when they build this Holocaust 

Museum inWa shington, and here too, you see when 
I write to them they don™t answer. You see, 
they have a very peculiar nast
y attitude.  If you are not Mr. 
Wi esel, they think you are nobody.  
And I don™t agree with them.  I offer ed them my
 book.  Here they build a Holocaust Memorial 
to ______ I wrote to them, they don™t even answ
er.  So I figure they can kiss me , you 
understand.  I wrote toWa shington. There was 
a big do inWa shington a couple of years ago 
and I went there because I thought I would meet
 some one from Minsk.  Nobody there. You see 
you have to understand some thing, th
at being in prison is one thi
ng and being in private life is 
another thing.  Many people use it to become  fa m
ous, to ma ke money out of it. Wh en I wrote 
my book I wrote to Mr.Wi esel, I said Sir, here is a book ma ybe you can combine these facts 

with one of your stories or coll
ect them, or some thing because your
 name  is better known than 
mi ne.  Neve r an answer. At least have thedecency and answer.  But even the Holocaust 

Memorial, nobody answers.  (Yiddish expression). 
 I sent them the books and I me t many Israeli 
Jews.  I think I would not have the good nerve, 
I wouldn™t have survived.  I slept whenever I 
had the chance. I can take tremendous pressure. 
 

Q: You stayed in Sweden until ™49 and then you ca
me toAmerica in ™49.  Now I™ve got basically, 
your brother ™s stor y up until he left for E
ngland.  Now what was your brother ™s na me? 
 

A: Curt Egon Rosenberg and later on he was know
n under Edgar M. Roberts in England. That™s 
why I went to Roberts, he didn™t want to go b
ack to his old name .  He was  born June 4, 1915. 
 

Q: Now, after Kristallnacht, you said–– 

 

A: He was taken to Sachsenhausen. 

 
Q: Ta ken to Sachsenhausen.  He was there fo
r about five months , three or four months? 
 

A: I think he came  back in February, maybe Fe
bruary or March.  I can™t  remember exactly. 
 

Q: He was born in Gottingen too?  

 

A: Everybody. The fa mily goes back to 1600. 

 

Q: O.K.What happened after when he got stam
ped, red stamped on his passport saying he had to 
leave the country? 
 

A: If you don™t leave, you have to go back to prison. 

 

Q: So he left? 

 

A: He was able to get to the Kitchener camp in
 Engl and.  It was called Kitchener camp because it 
was a Lord Kitchener who had opened this for 
the German young Jews.  I think they took in 
about 200 or 300, 500 people, I have no idea how ma ny.  I cannot tell you I wasn™t  there. Maybe 

2,000, I don™t know. They had to do far m wo
rk and garden work, things like that. 
 

Q: And he then, he changed his name? 

 

A: No. When he voluntee red when the war started, he voluntee re d for the BritishArmy, and he 
had to take  a British sounding name , English 
sounding name. They gave him the name, you 
know with new identity papers.  He b
ecame automatically an English citizen. 
 

Q: He fought in the war? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: What did he do? 

 

A: I have no idea.  He was a soldier, I don™t know, 
I couldn™t tell you.  He ne
ver talked about it.  I 
didn™t ask him either. The war was over when I me
t hi m.  I wasn™t  interested in war any more. 
 

Q: And he remained in England after the war? 

 

A: Ye s, yes, he died in England.   He died wh
en he was 60 years old, it was in 1975, heart attack.  I 
was talking on the telephone w
ith my aunt, bang, out!  He was only 60 years old.  He was 
ma rried, he had no children. They had a little
 factory and he was doing very well.  Ha rd 
working. We  saw each ot her each year. We  vis
ited each other each year, either I went there or  
he came here. We  were very close. 
 

Q: Let me  ask you about your pare
nts.  St art with your father. 
 

A: My father was born February 21, 1881. 

 

Q: And he was born where? 

 
A: InGottinge n. 

 

Q: He was born in Gottingen. And what was his full name ? 

 

A: FritzAlexander Rosenberg.  He and his two brot
hers Otto andArens inherited the factory from 
his father who died 1917, I think, because all the 
five sons were in the wa r.  He was born in 
1849. 
 

Q: This was the linen factory? 

 

A: Ye s.  My grandfather had starte
d it, my grandfather.  (aside: that
™s  the ma n I talked to, he is now 
in Texas.) 
 

Q: He worked in Gottingen? 

 

A: He owned the factory with his own two brothers. 

 

Q: And they all ran the factory? 

 

A: Different parts. You know, one was in the office, the other was running the factory, my father 
was traveling for sales.  My fa
ther was basically for sales. 
 

Q: And he mostly sold around Germany? 

 

A: Mostly in Hamburg, and the big cities.  Mostly big contracts fr om the ship companies, the 
military, things like this.  Hospitals, you know wh
erever you need linen with names and things 
like this.  Big orders. And then the depression 
came  and then the business went sour, you know.  
In the depression,America too at the same  ti me . 
 

Q: Do you remember when your parents got ma rried? 

 

A: They got ma rried 1913, Nove mber 9, 1913. That
 was a tragedy that we were deported on 
Nove mber 9. 
 

Q: On the same  time? 

 

A: That™s  why I reme mber the date extremely well. 

 

Q: The factory was seized in 1933? 

 

A: Ye s, 1933.  Gottingen wa s one of the worst Nazi 
cities, like all universit
y cities.  Heidelberg, 
Gottingen, all the universities.  N
azism was the greatest. And it 
was the students, you see, the 
students and we had the military garri sons ther e. 
This was altogether the reason for this.The 
smaller the cities, the more anti-Semitism. And Be
rlin wasn™t  that bad and Hamburg wasn™t  that 
bad but the smaller the cities, more the hatred. And all the Jews in Gottingen were well off in 

comparison to others. They were the store 
owners, the lawyers, the doctors, the business 
people, you know. 
 

Q: Do you remember any instances of overt anti-Semitism by German citizens? 
 

A: No, I was too small. You know my father w
ould come home and say,
 ﬁah, ah, look at these 
stupid people, I give them four weeks, they will be out.ﬂ That was his attitude. 
 

Q: You mean the Nazis, you mean? 

 

A: Ye s. They will never do anything to us, we 
are here since 1600.  I could only trace them to 
1700 when I went back now because all ceme teries and everyt hing had been destroye d. You 

know, there is almost nobody left now.  It doesn™t  ma ke muc h sense now. 
 

Q: And you we re all deported in ™38? 

 

A: No, in ™41. 

 

Q: That™s  right. You were ma de to leave, 
let™s see, your house and you moved to Hamb urg in 
1934.  Did your father do anythi
ng in particular when you move
d, after Kristallnacht until you 
were deported? 
 

A: No, he didn™t work after ™36, he couldn™t work an
y more after ™36. We  we re helped by an uncle 
of mi ne who was a millionaire, on my mother ™s 
si de, by the Je wish Committee and my brother, 
sister helped also.  My father had no m
oney since ™36.  Everything was taken away 
 

Q: O.K., then in ™41 you were deported to Minsk. 

 

A: Alltogether. 
 
Q: You all remained in Minsk until 
you left in ™43, in September? 

 

A: The ghetto I left September 1, 1943 and I 
was shipped toTr eblinka September 14, ™43. 
 

Q: Do you know what happened to them?  

 

A: Well, they were still alive at that time, but 
as I know from ot her peopl
e who survived, that the 
ghetto was liquidated September 28, ™43. 
 

Q: So not long after you left? 

 

A: Two weeks later. 

 

Q: Do you know what they did with 
these people, we re they gassed? 
 

A: Most probably gassed.  Either ga
ssed or shot.  It doesn™t ma ke any difference. They were told 
that they would be shipped back to Ge rmany.  Se e, the SS always put on a phony excuse to get 

the people into the cars. 
 

Q: You know, I didn™t ask you. You were ma rried in Minsk? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 
Q: Do you remember, what was the date of that?   I think you said it was 1942. 

 

A: No, September ™42. On a Sunday, September ™42, 
we finally arranged for the wedding.  It must 
be September ™42.  I™m sorry I don™t have th
e date.  Fifty years ago, you know I couldn™t . 
 

Q: The other thing I also did not ask you, can you desc
ribe the ghetto in Minsk a little bit, describe 
how big it was, how it was guarded, the fences, thi
ngs like that? We did a little bit, like where 
you stayed. 
 

A: I will gi ve you a plan later on. The ghetto
 was very big. We  only knew, I only knew the 
German part of the ghetto, especially where 
the red house and the white house was where we 
came in first. There was two different parts for the German,Austrian and Czech Jews. We 

never entered the Russian ghettos. We  weredivided by barbed wire. We  were not even 

permitted to talk to them. Later on it wasn™t  so ba
d. We  talked to them, the SS didn™t sa y much.  
We  exchanged goods because the Russian Jews were
 able to get much more food ‚cause they 
lived there, they knew the people against us a
nd the people would trade their coats and their 
clothes. We  were starving, you see. And actua
lly, their kids themselves because they had 

nothing to wear any more.  So the ghetto wa
s very big.  It was surrounded by barbed wire 
completely and there were SS guards on the outsi
de, on the inside were the Jewish guards and 
every ma n at a certain time had to make two hour
s at night guard duty. This was not only for 
people to get in but also for Jews not to run in
to the wire or do crazy things. You see, the 
Jewish commander thought it would be better to
 have law and order in the ghetto.  Not to 

aggravate the German SS or they would shoot ri
ght away. And the ma n who was in charge of 
this German/Jewish force is the one w
ho was later on sent back to Germany. 
 
Q: Oh right, the ma n you 
were telling me about. 
 
A: But he did a good job.  I mean the SS got in 
every day. Anybody could kill a Jew.  I me an on 
the holidays they would just shoot anybody that 
came  to the m.  It meant nothing. A dog was 
more valuable than a Jew. 
 

Q: Let me  ask you about your mother. 

 

A: My mother was born February 21, 1891, in Hamburg.  Her maiden name  was Herz.  Her first 
name  was Else. She had a brother and a sister an
d her father was still 
alive.  He died, my 
grandfather died 1934, natural death.  But she ha
d a brother and a sister and the brother was 
taken to pr ison because of having an affair with a German lady, which was against the law.  In 

the end my aunt was shipped toTheresienstadt in ‚43 and then toAuschwitz.  By the way, my 

grandmother who lived in Gottingen up to 1943, 
was 84 they shipped her toAuschwitz. 
 

Q: Do you have a picture of her? 

 

A: Ye s, I have one picture of my
 grandmother, she was a very courageous lady. And I heard from a 
letter I got from my uncle that my
 aunt was a real hero.  Let me  
se if I have a picture from my 
grandmother.  I thought I had one. 
 I have to find it.  Let me  see for one mome nt.  Maybe I don™t 
have it any more.  I don™t see it right now. 
 

Q: What did her father do for a living? 

 
A: Who, my mothers?   He was in export/impor
t business of grain. The grain business. 
 

Q: Did he have his own business? 

 

A: Ye s. Together with his son.  But when the s
on took over in ™34, there we
re already restrictions 
on Jews having businesses.  So littl
e, by little, all the Herz family 
was in the grain business.  It 
was a big family too. The Rosenberg were a big fa mily, fa mily, the Herz were a big fa mily. 
 

Q: Is there anything you reme mber particularly that
 stands out about some th
ing that happened to 
your mother that mi ght be significant, ot
her than what we al
ready talked about? 
 

A: My mother in Ha mburg, Gottingen? 

 

Q: Anything, especially from ™33 on? 

 

A: My mother was a very courageous lady w
ho was a very good cook, a very good housewife.  She 
could ma ke anything out of nothing.  She was edu
cated in Lausanne, spoke perfect French, was 
much more educatedthan my father. 
 

Q: Did she go to college, to a university? 

 

A: She went to a special, how do they
 call this, a special school for ladi
es at that time  in Lausanne.  
She was very well educated.  She spoke perfect 
French, my father didn™t speak any languages 
but he had a factory.  But they were ma tched up. 
This was not a love story. At that time , you 
know, I have a good ma n.  It was different at th
at time.  But they had a very good life and I 
don™t know how happy they were, I cannot tell you. 
 I was a small boy.There were a lot of 
fights when the factory went broke
 because my mother was used to a pl entiful life and money 
and all of a sudden there was no money. These I 
reme mber the fights between my parents.  But 
she was a very courageous lady in Ge rmany.  I mu
st say, honestly, I think most of all I have to 
say one thing, both of my parent
s were very very fair and und
erstanding people, very modern, 
very outgoing, gave us, the ch
ildren, a very very good upbringi
ng and education. This was 
more than most people do for their children. 
 

Q: And you told me  about some  of the period. 
 I just needed some for background. O.K., how 
about your sister? 
 

A: My sister, I feel in a cert
ain way sorry for my sister because she died very young. You see, 
when I look at my parents, I am sorry they di
ed, but they had already 
a certain amount of life 
behind them.  My sister was very young. When 
she was mur dered in ™43, she was about, she 
was born in ™17, 26 years old.  She had never 
experienced the joys of life.  She had no 
boyfriend, there was no hope, she had no beautiful 
clothes, or anything, 
nothing.  Not only had 
Hitler turned against us, the whole world had turn
ed agai nst us.  Because she could ha ve been 
saved, she wa s a very hard working girl, but she ne
ver had real joys.  I don
™t  think she ever had 
a real boyfriend, I mean yes, but nothing really 
steady or some thing like this. And when she 
was, I know if she was murdered, the same  with 
my parents or my firs
t wife, Erica. The young 
people, I feel more, muc h more sad about them 
than, you know, it™s one thing if I would have to 
go today, I would say O.K., like my wife passed 
away six years ago, O.K. I have so ma ny years 
left but if some thing would happe
n to my son or to my daughter,
 or to my  grandchildren would 

be much worse.  Because the 
life is in front of them.  
 
Q: What was your sister ™s full name ? 

 

A: Irmgard Rosenberg.  She was born in June 16, 1917. 

 

Q: Did she also go to public school? 

 

A: Ye s, we all went to public school.  In Ge
rmany you had to go to school. You had to go to 
school, there was no way out of it, they would force you to go to school. 
 

Q: And when did they kick you all out of school again? 

 

A: My sister and my brother left
 school when we came to Ha mburg.  She was about 16 or 17 years.  
My brother was already 19.  He
 already worked Gottenberg. 
 

Q: You said she worked as a salesperson?  

 

A: A sales apprentice, a company called Helfand 
in Ha mburg, not there any more, also Jewish 
company. You see, in ™33 and ™34, it was hard to
 get jobs in gentile comp anies, you had to work 
in Jewish companies. 
 

Q: Is there anything again, we™ve talked a little bi
t about.  She was obviously 
with the rest of your 
fa mily, that you reme mb er about her that sticks 
out in your mi nd from those years, from ™33 on? 
 

A: My sister wa s a very very good person, she wa
s too good and too, like all of us, we were all 
brought up with this honesty and decency and 
fairness.  Li ke it was done that way and 
especially in traditional Jewish fa milies. A
nd she lived at home and she had no boyfriend, if 
she went out to movies with my brother or if
 she went with a boy my brother would go along.  
It was a different lifestyle.  But she was a very, 
we got along very well, 
my sister and I.  She 
was a very good person. Anything outstanding?   N
o, but she liked to dance and she liked music 

and she liked all the good things in life, 
but it never came through.  It was a tragedy. 
 

Q: Did any of the, like the depr
ivations of your going to Minsk, 
was there anything in particular 
that she got upset about. You 
know what I mean, that really 
bothered her about the situation 
you were in? 
 

A: We  all did not expect, none of us expect
ed to be murdered.  Everybody, you know when you 
have people, when you are sick or when you are 
drowning in water or wh
en you are in a fire, 
you, the person, hopes that you will be saved. 
 Understand?  Everybody, everybody, including 
myself, always try, there are so ma ny sickness
es behind me .  I don™t want to talk about my 
private life.  Everybody will always try and think 
that he will be the one who will be saved.  
And everybody looks into a mi rror a
nd thinks that he is the best
 person or the best looking 
person or the tallest person or th
e honest person.  He mi ght be th
e biggest crook but he thinks he 
is honest.  So you see what really we nt on in th
e mi nd of my  sister, I hon
estly cannot tell you.  I 
cannot tell you of my father.  I 
know my father was an outspoken optimist and ﬁthey don™t mean 
us, we only work there.ﬂ And certainly all of us
 expected us  to work and after the war go back 

home . You could not imagine that
 this cruelty, this 
ma ss mur der would exist.  It was abnorma l 
for the world.  I mean I reme mber that inTu
rkey in 1940, my father told us and my uncle 

Philip, my father would talk a
bout the firstWorldWa r, about 
______ what they saw there, they 
were young and then the Germans, t hey 
fought the Frenchmen.  Ooh, ________ my uncle 
would say. These French people, they must be ______.All nonsense, they killed each other for 

nothing. That whole killing is nonsense. Ther
e goes a soldier and kills some one, doesn™t  know 
who he kills. You take a knife and you want to kill me , I will try to ki ll you first. All nonsense, 

war.  Makes for the politicians, for big people,
 not for the poor people.
 This goes back for 
thousands of years. The kings always defer,
 the general always st
ood behind that you go.  He 
didn™t go. 
 

Q: Would you like to talk about your uncle? 

 

A: No, it™s too far. There come s a point where 
you have to stop.  I mean, I could go on with my 
fa mily. There are so ma ny people who were killed 
and murdered and suicide, it comes too far.  
He was a very good ma n, very poor when he come s toAmer ica.  Died of cancer. The funny 

stories when he was in the hospital in San Fran
cisco and my brother came from England to visit 
him once more.  He visited him and he couldn™t tal
k, they had to put a tube
 in his throat, and the 
doctor said to us, give him a week, that™s  it.  
You call us. We ll, one day I was working and my 
wife called me  and she said Henry there is a te
legram from San Francisco, uncle Philip had 
passed away.  Sorry to hear that. 
 So I called the hospita
l at night when I come home.  I said this 
is Henry Robertson, I hear my uncle, Mr. Phil
ip Herz passed away, so whoever was on the 
phone said, if you wait a mi nute, would you like to 
talk to him?   Pardon me, talk to him, I 
cannot understand it.  So, he couldn™t 
talk, but he put the thing, he c
ould talk.  He said ﬁhello.ﬂ  
I said Philip, what are you doing?  We ll, I™m sl
eeping.  I motioned, I understand that he is dead.  
Let me  see the telegram. What they wrote, Uncle Philip is dying, we need $400 to bury him.  

You see, but my wife wa s so excited that she thou
ght he™s  dying.  He died twelve days later.  
And then they couldn™t bury him and 
I called the funeral parl
or, this is a true story, I said this is 
Mr. Robertson in NewYork, I want to send you the money. We ll, he said, don™t worry your 

uncle is happily on ice, he cannot be buried 
because we can only bury him when the money 
come s from Social Security.  I™ll
 send you the mo ney.  No, no, it ha
s to be proper.  He was four 
weeks happily on ice before they buried him.  
An unbelievable story. There is no feeling.  
That™s  why I do and I considered it my duty to 
tell everybody who wants to
 listen to it that 
whatever happened in the Holocaust, can neverhappen again. And I will do my damn  best 

when I talk to people I always tell them whatever
 they want to hear.  
Most people don™t want to 
hear about it.  I can™t  take it, you know.  Isay you should hear about it so you know what™s  

going on.
