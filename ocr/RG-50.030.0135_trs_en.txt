EUGENE LIPMAN 
February 8, 1990 
 
 
Q: Would you tell me  your name  please? 

 

A: EugeneLipman. 

 

Q: And where and when were you born? 

 

A: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 13, 1919. 

 

Q: Okay. Uh...Gene, tell me some thing about
 your family and growing up in Pittsburgh. 
 

A: Uh...My father was a small jeweler in th
e mill di strict of Pittsburgh, my mother a 
Pittsburgher by the way. My father was born 
in Europe...uh...had and raised children and 
was the compliant home maker. Uh...We never had any mone y. My grandparents,...uh...all 

four, lived in Pittsburgh until my grandfather, my  paternal went off to Palestine. In 1925 

or 6 came back for my Bar Mitzvah celebrati
on, and then came  back permanently during 
World Wa r II because the idea of the Germans taking over Palestine was an unpleasant 

idea to hi m and so he came back and he di
ed in Pittsburgh. We are a long lived family. 

My paternal grandfather was 93 at the time 
of his death. Uh...I grew up in this mill 
distri ct  of Pittsburgh to the age of  7, then moved to the ghetto of Squirrel Hill beca use I 

had to go to Hebrew and all the synagogues 
and Hebrew schools were in Squirrel Hill, 
and I completed my high school educa
tion at High School, 40 percent Jewish 
and...uh...finished in 1936, by which time I had 
already decided to be a Rabbi. And 
started the Pitt because I could live at home 
and go to Pitt. This was depression time. And 
then in 38...Solomon Freuhauf 
who was my mentor inthis 
Ra bbi business decided that I 
was wasting my time in Pittsburgh and sent 
me off to Cincinnati. I went to Hebrew 
College in Ci ncinnati and the University of Ci
ncinnati at the same  ti me . They were across 
the street from the other...from each other. They still are. And...uh...got my degree from 

University of Cincinnati, fini
shed it HUC in 1943, having accel
erated a year because they 
needed chaplains so badly. And...uh...so we went
 to school for 22 straight months in 
order to accomplish this. No 
professor would allow us to give up a course. How can you 

be a chaplain without my course in mi d ru
sh five, one of them was known to say. Uh...It 
was required by the military that you have a year  of experience before you can go into 

chaplaincy, and so I replaced a Rabbi in Fort
 Worth, Texas, who went into the Navy and 
spent a very uncomfortable year there. 
I was 23 years old and everybody I me t in the 
street 23 years old was in uniform. Uh...The
 entire American army was in Texas. 

And...uh...I was not in uniform so as  soon as I co
uld get into uniform, I got into uniform. 
Uh...We  had ma rried...in...1943, 
the day after ordination. It wa s a long weekend, 
and...uh...by the time I went into the military, Esther was pregnant with our first child. 
 

Q: When and under...when did you go overs
eas. What were the circumstances?

A: Well, I had decided very early on that my 
war in World War II was the European theater, 
not the Pacific theatre, even though I wavered 
on that because of some thing I'll me ntion 
in a mi nute. But I had really decided that I 
wanted to go to Germany and I had asked the 
Chief Chaplain's  office to ship me  to Ge rmany. Going overseas was unavoidable. I knew 

that. And so–uh...in February of 1945, I got orde
rs to go overseas and didn't get there 
until April because that's the war the army
 worke d. The...uh...thing I di dn't me ntion to 
you was that while I was in Fort Worth, 
a me mber of my congregation who had 

rabbinical connections...uh..asked me, right af
ter Yom Kippur services, as a ma tter of 
fact, if I had ever thought about becomi ng a 
pilot. Uh...He taught fairy pilots, the wome n 
pilots. 
 

Q: Excuse me . I want to hold it. And can you st
op the tape please?  Alrigh
t, just hold the tape 
for a mi nute and then we'll pick it up. We 'v
e had construction problems on the third floor. 
The sound is comi ng through the roof. Okay. Th
ese people are just marvelous. What we 
will do, we'll back it from the beginning of th
at story. I'll ask you to desc ribe... Dean, tell 
me  about...uh...the gentlema n in Texas. 
 

A: His name  was Stanley Herst, and he had 
rabbinical connections. He came  up to me  aft e r 
services on Yom Kippur  and introduced hims elf.
 We had never met. I had been there all 

of about 4 weeks after all, and 
said that all his adult wanted 
to teach a Rabbi to fly and all 
Rabbis were chicken. And being 23, I wasn't  ha
ving any of that and I said, "When do we 
start." And he said, "Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock." And (laughte
r) I said, "No. I can't  
do it tomorrow. Give me a couple da ys." Because, among other things, I didn't have a 

flight jacket. And in those days, you had to wear a yellow jacket. You couldn't go up in 

an airplane. They were open. There were no 
closed airplanes. That's a long time ago. So 
he taught me  to fly in his little piper cub 
which went 70 miles an hour ma ximu m, and I 
notified the...uh...Jewish 
Welfare Board and the Chief Chaplain's office that I was doing 
this in case it was of interest. And the Chie
f Chaplain's  office was very interested, they 
said. So I got my license and...uh...after Chapla
in's  school, which was 5 weeks we got our 
assignments and I was signed to the armo
red force. And I thought, you know, "Typical 

Ar my screw up!" But...uh...It was done deliberat
ely. I found out that they just didn't want 

Chaplains flying airplanes. They wanted Chaplains praying for troops. And so I did go to 

Europe instead of doing Island hopping in the 
Pacific was what they had been talking 
about. So I arrived in Europe in...uh...
April 1945. The...uh...voyage was of interest 
historically. I became the radio announcer 
on the plane...I...on the ship. I pr obably was 
the only one who could read English, some thi
ng of the sort. And several times a day I did 
news broadcasts, which I had written from
 whatever ma terial they could garner. 
Uh...Historically, I guess the most importa
nt thing I did was announce the death of 
Franklin Roosevelt...uh...who died while wewere on our way overseas. That was a very 

discouraging and depressing...uh...i
dea. Who...who was Truman beca me  a very important 
question to those of us who were on our 
way overseas. We  also had a...uh... ma rathon 
bridge game  going. It should be noted for 
historical record th
at nobody in my Ar my 
career ever suggested that we play bridge fo
r money. Never did. There were eight of us in 
this bridge game  and we cut in and cut out 
for all kinds of necessa
ry purposes, like sleep. 
And...uh...I didn't get a good hand (laughing) in
 14 days. Several million points were 
involved in my losses. Uh...I also agreed
 to...uh...box for the only time  in my life, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135

because they were having a series of boxing ma tches and they couldn't find a heavy 
weight to fight against this lieutenant 
who was crazy enough to volunteer, but he had 
fought a couple of times before. We  s o
rt of sparred around for three rounds. 
I...uh...developed a strep ear toward the end 
of the voyage and was taken by ambulance 
from dockside to an Evac hospital just out
side Lahov in France. And the rumor went 
around that this guy I had fought against hadbeaten me  up so badly that I had been 

hospitalized. And...uh...rumor also went around th
at I was being sent back home  again 

because I was so sick. I heard that long 
after I got into Germa ny. Couple...couple of 
people were surprised to see me . I was in th
is hospital for 3 days. The hospital chaplain, 
who was bored out of his mi nd,...uh... stole a coup
le of bicycles and he and I peddled 
each night into this little vill
age where he had me t a French 
couple, and we played br idge 
in French, which was fun. Uh...Eventually, thoug
h, that had to stop and I had to get to 
work. So I...uh...was put onto a troop train head
ed for Ger many. Typical 40 and 8 box car 
and I staked out my little piece of turf big enough for my pack and me , and then I was 

standing at the entrance to this box car waiti
ng for the train to start and some  sergeant 
was walking up and down yelling, "Who can 
talk French?  Who knows some  Frenc h?" 
So, one never volunteers, but he wasn't  getting anybody and I said,...uh... "Will some  

French do? " And he says, "Three words will 
do. And Colonel needs a French transl ator." 
So I went back to the Colonel, an old re
gular Army ma n, obviously
 unsuccessful because 
he was in the transportation corps running th
ese troop trains which didn't require muc h 
military skill. And he was delight ed to see me , and I was moved into hi s ca r which was 

not a box car. It was a heated Pullman car 
and...uh...I lived very well for 5 days going 
into France. Uh...My job was every time the...uh..
. train stopped to tear up to the other 
end to the engineer and ask him wha t  was 
wrong. And he told me , "Signal." (laughing) 
Every time, it was "Red Signal. I can't  go." 
And I went back and told the Colonel who 
was quite content to go on doing whatever he 
was doing. I had lots of bad books to read. I 
had a fine, fine trip into Germany. Uh...wasn'
t wanted in Germany at that time. No one 
knew what to do with me. I was moved back to a town in Belgium called Verea, 

and...uh...as a casual. I did not have an assignm
ent. And then V.E. day came, and we 
celebrated V.E. day by going from our camp whi c h was outside Verea into Verea to 

watch the celebration and to celebrate. I was 
depressed. I didn't  f
eel like celebrating. I 
don't know why. I...Probably because I was 
alone, and...uh...couldn't think of much to 
celebrate as a matter of fact. The world was ove
r, but in the square 
in Verea, I saw some 
me n and wome n in concentration camp unifor m
s. Clearly! Uh...I knew what they were, 
and they were standing over there, and I wa
lked over toward them. They recognized my 
insignia and crowded around because I was the fi
rst American Jew that they had run into. 
They were Buchenwald graduates, and they 
were the fi rst survivors of the Holocaust 
whom I me t. Uh... They didn't want anything. 
I didn't have anything. Uh... But we talked, 
and...uh...they did a lot, my first 
concentration stories, my fi
rst Holocaust stories. They 
were followed by thousands more Holocaust stor
ies over the course of the next 3 years. I 
did get an assignment to 22nd Corps Headqua
rters in the Rhineland. Our town was 
Hildan, not to far from Cologne, and I move
d in. Large territory, all of the Rhineland, 
including Cologne. A lot of troops. Theoreti
cally, we were conducting services for all 
those troops. I got a jeep and we
nt to work. Early discovered 
that a lot of German Jews 
and a lot of East European Jews had come  
into the area not in displaced persons camps, 
but living on their own where they could find 
a place to live, which many of them could

not do. So I began to do three things. First 
of all to push military governme nt to find 
housing for them; second, to see that they got 
food because they had no source of income 
and they did not get UNRRA food because 
they were not in a UNRRA installation. 
And...uh...some clothing because they were sti
ll wearing concentration camp unifor ms, 
and that was not a very good idea. Uh...So my 
services with American
 soldiers consisted 
of a gang comi ng together. There were about
 10 of these a week, and my saying to 
them,...uh... "Anybody need to say cottage, ...uh.
..there was fr equently some body who 
needed to say cottage, so we had a short se
rvice cottage, and then I said, "Let's go. We  
need food. Let's go get it." And after the firs
t time in each of these installations, anybody 
who could beg, borrow or steal a truck...uh...cam
e  with truck, and we went to army 
depots and we got food. Uh...Sometimes was ab
le to sign for it. I have often had a 
nightmare about the army catching up with
 my memorandum receipts...uh...and they will 
some  day. My great, great, great grandchild
ren ma y have a problem with the army...uh...I 
know that they catch up, because about 1947 or 48, my uncle who fought in France in 

World Wa r I got a bill from the United States
 Army for $45 for a pistol that he had 
signed a me morandum r eceipt  for in France, 
and had never turned in. ...Uh...Actually, he 
had turned it in, but the Ar my didn't think 
so. So he had a correspondence with the army 
for ma ny, many moons a bout that mo ney for the...
I think this was all 
those years later...so 
some day... Most of the time, though, we didn't bothe
r to sign for it. We  just stole it. And 
there were millions of tons of supplies 
stashed in depots around the area and...uh...the y 

should be used. And they were. We  also ma nage
d to get hold of some kinds of clothing. 
Couldn't use uniforms, of course, but there wa
s underwear. There were socks. There were 

shoes. There were jackets and things like th
at. So, we were starti
ng a pretty good system 
going when orders came  out moving us. U
h...The British were taking over our area. 
There had been negotiations and mo st of the Rhineland became British zone. And in 

typical army fashion we were moved as 
far as you could get, which was Plezn, 
Czechoslovakia. We  packed up and we started across Germany. Before that 

happened...after we got the notice that the Briti
sh were comi ng in and before we left, I 
decided that I better do someth
ing in this part of Germany 
that needed doing for me . I  
went to Dachau. Took a 3 day pass and took my j eep and went down to Dachau where 

Abe Klausner, my classmate, ...uh...was working fulltime, and Klausner's a story unto 

himself, and we'll probably get around to it in
 the course of this thing. Uh...My reaction 
to Dachau was what exactly what you would 
expect somebody's reaction to Dachau to be. 

There was still 30 odd thousand Jews there. 
Some  were dying each day cause there was 
no way for them to ma ke it. Most of them 
were going to live. They didn't look like they 
were going to live, but the Army medical 
people, who are very good by the way, said 
they were going to live. Abe was in the same
 business that I was i
n, only more so as he 
had this fine clothing for them. I remember th
e day that he got 38 thousand pairs of shoes 
out of a German Ar my warehouse just by goi
ng in, opening the door
s, and taking them. 
And...uh...Every day he had peopl
e to bury. I...uh...often have said to people who are 
skeptical about the si ze of the Holocaust th
at if they would like me  to step off 
approxima tely how ma ny...uh...feet of space it takes 
in full directions to make a rectangle 
that would hold 70,000 dead Jews, I know how 
to do that because I have seen them. 
Uh...I stayed those 3 days with Abe and then went back. On the way to Czechoslova ki a, 

we went through Buchenwald. And once and fo
r all...uh...the myths got exploded that the 
Germans di dn't know a bout concentration camps cause when we went into the ma rvelous 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135

old town of Yana, and into the wonderful 
former capitol of the 
German Republic of 
Wei mar, I saw s moke. And I asked what it 
was, and those we re the fires, not 
the...uh...crema torium fires, but the fires at 
the Buchenwald concen
tration camp where 
there were still pe ople. You could see them. Th
ey were only 3, 4 miles away from each of 
those two towns. I have a funny feeling that 
when the wind blew the right...blew the right 
way during those years...uh...you could smell Buchenwald without any trouble. We  got to 

Plzen, and I settled into my room, and to my 
offi ce. Uh...Two things happened in fairly 

short order, one of which is...uh...just of histor
ic interest. The other of which transforme d 
my life. I'll do the easy one first. I got a phone 
call. It was the Bishop of Plzen, a Catholic 
Bishop who told me  his name , which I don't re
me mber. And I said to him, "Sir, I.. (You 
see he had some  English)...that you want my 
Catholic colleague, Chaplain Straun," and 
he said, "No. You're the Rabbi, aren't you?" 
And I said, "Yes Sir." 
And he said, "You're 
the ma n I want to come  to see, he said, "You don't have to come  out here." It was a 

couple of mi les from us to the center of to
wn whe r e the cathedral was. "I am comi ng 
down this evening. I'll stop in." And I went 
to see him. And I met for the first time a 
bishop who looked like a bishop. You know, the 
long robes, the pointed toes, shoes, the 
whole business, and he greeted me  ve ry warm
ly and said that he wanted to take me  
some where. Didn't want to explain too much, but that...uh...it will be a gr eat relief to one 

of his parishioners if I would 
go with him. I said, "Alright,"
 and we ma de a date for the 
next afternoon. We  went into
 the old part of Plzen, wh
ich is centuries old. These 
wonderful 4 and 5 story apartment buildings, 
which looked like a sl
um on the outside and 
are often very nice on the inside, and I was introduced to a ma n name d Snyder, an 

engineer, who told me  the following story. In
 the building in which 
he lived, a neighbor 
had been...Rabbi Katz, the Rabbi of the 
congregation in Plze
n. The synagogue, by the 
way, was still standing. We clean
ed it out. It had been ma de
 a warehouse, of course, by 
the Germans, and it was rededicated and used
 by the Jews who happened to be in Plzen 
during that time . It ma y still be used. I have
 no idea. (Sigh) Ra bbi Katz and Mr. Snyder, 
became very close friends because they both had an interest  in French impressionist 

paintings, and they both collected what they 
could afford to collect. In 1938, when the 
Nazis came in, the Rabbi said to Snyder, "T
hey are going to take our pictures because 
they want paintings. They st
eal paintings. Let's hide them
. Snyder, being an engineer, 
was ingenious, and he took his living room
 which was 40 feet long, by the way. One of 
these European saloon-type rooms, and he bui
lt a fake wall 3 feet 
in from the regular 
wall, and that wall was covered with book sh
elves and other nice things, with one a 
typical spring door. He took me  inside, and th
ere were all the paintings which they had 
stashed away, both Rabbi Katz's and his. 
His agreement with Rabbi Katz was that, 
obviously, if Katz came back...uh...the paintings w
ould be his...his paintin
gs. If he did not 
come  back, all the paintings would be Snyder'
s. Uh...He also left some  books, and that's 
why the Bishop had taken me . His most pr
ecious books. Rabbi Katz was killed in 
Auschwitz, his whole family, so there was nobody 
to inherit either the paintings or the 
books. And I took the books at Snyder's reque
st. An interesting group of 4, 5 books. Not 
his library, just the books he cared most about
. One 2 volume  set turns out to be precious. 
It's now in the rare book room of our semi nary 
in Cincinnati. It's one of two copies of this 
1520 Hebrew edition of one of the great classi
cs... uh...in the whole world. The other one 

is at Oxford. Uh...There were some  German
 poe ms , beautiful edition, which I gave to 
Sylvia. We 'll come across Sylvia shortl
y, and...uh...a Hebrew New Testament, 17th 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
6 
 
Century, which I gave to the Bishop. And...uh...f
or myself, I kept and sent home an 
album of Visidor Kaufman, a pr
ince. Visidor Kaufma n was a  fi
ne classical Jewish painter 
of the beginning of the 20th century who was 
hims elf Austrian and got
 interest ed in East 
European types. And his paintings of East Eu
ropean Jews and East European scenes are 
classics. And...uh...I have been distributing thos
e to friends, and I have one or two of 
them. That was my visit with the Bishop, and these books. The same  day there was a 
knock on my door and a little woma n walked in, in an American Red Cross uniform. 

Uh...Sylvia was ma ybe 5 feet tall, a skinny li
ttle thing, very good 
looking, about 10 years 
older than I, and she told me  the following 
story. She was a social worker who had been 
part of the social work departme nt at St even Wi se Free Synagogue, which was then just 

called Free Synagogue because Steven Wi se 
was still living. And she had worked for 
Wi se Ł, and told wonderful stor
ies about Steven Wi se. When Am
erica got into the war, he 
said to her, "You have to go into the Red 
Cross." And she said, "Why?  To feed donuts to 
G.I.'s ? "  And he said, "Yes, because in Europe
 you are going to be in front line areas, and 

you are going to be able to help Jews. There wi
ll be survivors, and they are going to need 
all kinds of help and you're just the type to
 do it." He was right. She was just the type. 
She got into the Red Cross. She went 
to Europe, ...uh...opened one of the first 
concentration camps in France...uh...organized all 
of the little kids, 
and mi ddle sized kids 
who survived, and that was the transport 
that we nt to Palestine legally...uh...after 
liberation. She landed in Czechoslova kia. I 
don't know how. And was the director of the 
Red Cross club in downtown Plzen. She had four other wome n working with her. And 

from early in the morning till 10 o'clock at
 night, she handed out
 donuts and coffee and 
talked and chatted with American soldiers. 
Then they closed up for the night, and they 
opened the back door and the Jews started to 
come in for all sorts of things. Uh...Sylvia 
asked me  if I wanted to help Jews. Si nce th
at's why I went to Europe, I agreed "Yal," 
and...uh...asked her what was going on. She had 
been contacted by the Jewish Brigade 
group which was in Italy. They had been attach
ed to the British army in Italy, had fought 
through the war, and at the end of the war we
re in town called Trevisio, way up in the 
Italian Alps. Imme diately, they organized them
selves to work with Jews and they sent  
ambulances and they sent trucks over the hills 
into Austria and they began to move Jews 
into It aly to get on ships, illeg
al of course, to go to Palestin
e, and would I help with this 
enterprise?  We could send Jews
 from Czechoslovakia into Au
stria and the Brigade would 
pick them up and take them to Italy. That 
sounded like a very intr
iguing idea to a 25 year 
old kid. Cops and robbers! And so Sylvia 
and I organized a move me nt out of the 
American zone of Czechoslovakia. Actually, 
it was out of all of C
zechoslovakia, because 
at that point the border between the Ameri
can zone and the Russian zone was an open 
border. We  were still friendly. We  mutually
 declared the Cold Wa r only in August of 
1945. So I was given the 3rd language...uh...pass 
to go anywhere in Czechoslovakia I 
wanted to go for my purposes. And...uh...two th
ings happened. First, Sylvia and I went 
over to Prague. There we re 6,000 Jews in the 
Rothchild Hospital there without a place to 
go, and new people were comi ng in all the time.
 Some from Theresienstadt. First time I 

had heard of Theresienstadt. Others fr om fu
rther East comi ng We st because they had no 
intentions of living in the East. Uh...Pola
nd was not a place for Jews. Uh...They didn't 
want to live in Hungary. They 
didn't want to Czech. They didn't  want to live in Europe. 
They wanted out. And they would come  to
 a Jewish center hoping that some body would 
have some  ideas about how to get out. They
 were also looking 
for relatives...uh...a very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135

important function. We 'l l talk about that some  mo re when we come  back to Abe 
Klausner. We organized...uh...a way for these Jews in the Rothchild Hospital 

to...uh...receive railroad passes to come  into th
e city of Plzen. From Prague to Plzen is 
only about 40 or 50 miles. The only way to ge
t there is by train. We  then proceeded to 
type one at a time...uh...passes, authorizing th
is person a United Nation's Stateless Person 
to travel from Prague to Plzen for the pur
pose of looking for relatives. We  looked around 
Plzen for the biggest stamp we could find. I 
haven't any idea what it was about, but we  
found one and got a little bunch of red stamp 
pads and we put big red stamps on this 
thing and signed the name  of a non-existent
 American Colonel to this docume nt. 

And...uh...We would collect them when the peopl
e came into Plzen and then take them 
back to Prague because I could travel. A
nd...uh...leave them at our Headquarters, hospital 
and a new group would come . Uh...We wanted th
em to come a few at a time . We  didn't  
want large groups taking over trains, so they
 came in every day. And they reported to us 
at the Red Cr oss Club after 10 o'clock at night, and we drove them out to the Karlov 

displaced persons camp which was just on th
e edge of Plzen. It was an UNRRA ca mp. 
We were able to do this because of a rather
 remarkable coincidence. I went out to the 
camp to meet the Director  and see if we coul
d ma ke a deal for our people to spend some 
time in the camp. His name  was Andrew C. 
Dunn, and when we met I said, "Tell me. 
Does the C stand for Carnegie? ," and he 
said, "How do you know? "  I said, "Because 
anybody with name d Dunn with the fi rst name  
Andrew, the chances are fifty fifty that 
your mi ddle name  would be Carnegie, and you ha
ve to be from Pittsburgh." And he said, 
"Amazing." I said, "Yal, So a m I." And we ta
lked and he said, "Lipma n. Lipman. Is your 
old ma n a jeweler? " And I said, "Yal." A
nd he said, "I bought my wedding ring from 
him." His assistant, a woma n na me d Fa
y Green, who ma ny years later became his 
wife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so
 he offered a five hundred in his camp.. 
We used for transportation to Austria and 
the answer was U.S. Ar my trucks. And who 
drove them? U.S. Ar my personnel. Why di
d they do it?  Scotch. And some money. We 

did not want people doing us favors. We were
 commercial. Uh...We  ma de  a trip down to 
the Austrian border and ma de the disc
overy that the only 
bridge across the 
Danu...Australian RiverŁ that we knew about was a military br idge and we  weren't about 

to use that. So we went down the road looking 
for a way to get across 
that blasted river, 
and we found one. It was an ol
d dam no longer in use, but se
rviceable and was just wide 
enough at the top for an Ar my 6-podŁ to get 
across with about 6 inches of play on each 
side. And that's  the one we used. We went 
across the dam into Austria and found our way 
either  to Lint z or to Gratz or to Saltsport,
 depending on whether the Brigade told us to 

bring this bunch of Jews. Others, it worked. 
But I have to tell you where we got the liquor 
because that involves one of my mor e favorite
 me mories. I was entitled to a few bottles 
of Scotch a week as a...I was a Captain by then. That wasn't  enough because we needed at 

least a dozen to 20 trucks or it wasn't worth 
taking the chance on the trip. Uh...One of the 
breaks we got by the way...lots of breaks in this
...Massel is not to be considered a mi nor 
thing. The...uh...sergeant in charge of our mo
tor pool at Corps Headquarters. Now Corps 
Headquarters has a lot of truc
ks. It just does. Uh...Corps
 a big thing. Was a sergeant 
name d Katz, and he was from Brooklyn, and Se
rgeant Katz and I ma de
 a deal that he 
would get truck drivers for me  and trucks and we would pay with money and Scotch. As I 

recall, it was 2 bottles per round trip or 
some thing like that. But where the Hell do you 
get Scotch in that ki nd of quantity? And I decide
d to take a real risk. I went to my senior

chaplain, a Presbyterian from Kansa s , Bird Co
lonel, full Colonel, but not regular army. 
He was a reservist. A very, quiet, pleasant ma n. He said to me , "You know, I haven't 

asked you any questions, but you travel a lot mo
re than is comfortable for the Chief of 
Staff." Cause I was going to all the Jewish
 camps and communities and people I could 
find all over Czechoslovakia. I was also goi
ng to Theresienstadt by then. We haven't 
come  to The r esienstadt yet. And he sa
id...uh...Chief of Staff has asked...has asked me  
about this and I said I would 
investigate it." He said, "I 
can cover for you if I know where 
you are going. And you haven't any reason to tell me  where you are going, but you will 

have to or I can't  cover for you with the Chief of
 Staff," who is after all a 2-star General. I 
said, "Okay. I'll make a deal with you. 
When I leave each day, I will put under your 
blotter a statement of where I am goi ng, from 
town to town to town each day, and then 
I'll give you my trip ticket. And you validate 
it if you chose to do so." He said, "Of 
course, I chose to do so. I know what you're doi
ng and you got to do it." He did not know 
that we were taking Jews to Austria, but 
he knew I was working with Jewish displaced 
persons and he thought that was absolutely 
essential. Bless him, said I. He says, 
"Anything else I can do for you? " And I said, "Yal
. You're a Bird Colonel. You get all the 
liquor you wa nt, don't you?" He said, "I wouldn't know. I don't drink." I said, "I knew 

that, but you'r e about to." And he listened a
nd he said a couple of people in supply are 
going to be awfully (laughing) surprised. I sa
id, "You don't have to explain what you're 
doing with it. It's  for charitable purposes that
 you getting into Protestant charities in 
Czechoslovakia which is your bound duty as a Ch
ristian." And he smiled and he thought 
that ma de sense, and I got all the liquor I want
ed from then on, on his tab. Bless his heart. 
I was...I heard of his death in the early
 50s, and I was very sorry. He was a good, good 
ma n. He saved my life, a nd saved Jews. That operation worked very well until August 

when...uh...we got caught in one of the Austri
a towns. Red handed! The whole bunch of 
us! We  had not yet transferred these pe
ople to the Jewish Brigade...uh...and we got 
picked up. And I got terrible reaming from 
a General who announced me that he was 
going to radio my General imme diatel
y, and I would be court-ma rtialed. 
And...uh...General Hubner did not court ma rtia
l me . General Hubner, who was known as 
the little Patton, was a tough...uh...guy, but he wanted to get rid of Jews. He didn't want 

Jews in his territory. I have
 to tell you the Jewish disp
laced persons were the only 
displaced persons who were difficult. All 
other displaced pe rsons, and there were 20 
some  nationalities of displaced persons...O
uter Mongolians, for example, that the 
Germans i mported for labor purposes. They were
 grateful for being alive, for being fed 
by UNRRA where they ate better than they ha
d eaten most of their lives, and they were 
no hurry to go home . The Jews we
re not grateful. The Jews were
 in terr ible conflict over 
being alive, over having survived. They
 didn't like anybody very much and...uh...they 
wanted out, and nobody would let them out. 
And so they caused more trouble than 
everybody else put together. Some  of us underst
ood it. We  tried to organize it so that it 
wasn't  too difficult. In addition, of course, we
 had all the internal Jewish problems that 
we always have. For example, within a mont
h of l i beration every Zi
onist party there wa s 
was in business, and they all wanted pape
r for publications a
nd they all wanted 
everything. It was not easy. And these were not 
pleasant people at that
 point, and I think 
that should be understandable that they were
 not. So General HubnerŁ said, "Get them out 
of here. I don't care." He didn't tell me that, but that's how he behaved. One incident will 

illust rate this. He called Sylvia and me  in 
one day. Now I had never me t General Hubner. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135

Uh...Captains don't monkey around much with 
3-star generals. There are layers of 
bureaucracy in between, and certainly Red Cr
oss women don't  have a lot to do with 
Generals, though Sylvia had had mor e  to do 
with Hubner than most because she was 
always making demands. Sylvia was a 
tough, tough lady. And Sylvia told the 
General...uh...got what she wanted most of the time, because the General didn't want to 

monkey with the Red Cross. He needed the 
Red Cross. Those donuts were very precious. 
Donuts and coffee kept American troops going. 
Uh...He called us in and said, "I hear 
there is going to be a Jewish meeting in 
London to talk about the 
future of all these 
Jews." And we said, "Yep." And he sai
d, "You're going. You go my plane. When does 
the meeting start? " And we told and he sai
d, "Okay. Two days before that, get out there 
and tell them for me  to get all these Jews 
out of here. They should do everything they can 
do to get them out fast. It's not good for them
 and it is not good for us either." And he 
said it not unkindly, but he wasn't  smiling. A
nd Sylvia and I flew to London to the special 
Zionist Congress that wa s called in July in 
London, the chief purpose of which was to set 
the course that would lead to...uh...Israel's  i
ndependence 3 years later, which meant that 
Ben-Gurion had a fight with Wi etzman 
and Be n-Gurion wiped up the floor with 
Wi etz man in a 4 hour Yiddish speech which,for me , is pretty unforgettable. Uh...What 

did he say?  He did what Ben-
Gurion always did. Ben-Gurion's idea of a speech was first 
to tell the history of the Jewi
sh people, starting back with
 Abraham and working his way 
up. Sometimes I felt like he was going it 
mi nute by mi nute. Four hours was not his 
longest speech. Uh...He has ma de longer. A
nd then rehearsing the Zionist move me nt 
from Belu all the way up...uh...and then mi nut
e by mi nute the events of World Wa r II, 
subjectively stated so that Wi etz man looked 
like an idiot who played the British and he 
was the savior who was going to 
see to it that we had a Jewish
 State. And they believed 
him. And Wietzman was really not in condi
tion to do a proper answer. Wi etzman aged 10 
years in 5 days, and he became the old ma n, the inevitabl e person to the first President of 
the State. Powerless and ceremonial. That's 
what Wi etzman became as of that day. Ben-
Gurion became  the leader of the Zionist m
ove me nt. Uh...Sylvia and I did not spend much 
time in sessions. We spent our time meeting peopl
e that  Steven Wi se told us to meet to 
tell them about Czechoslovakia, to tell them
 about displaced persons
, to tell them about 
the Haganah, and to urge certain kinds of 
support, none of which we had yet gotten. I me t 
some  fascinating people. Uh...I
 discovered this Lord Readin
g. Rufus Isaacs had gout, and 
that Lady Reading was really a lady and as 
passionate about...uh...Jew
ish things as any 
convert could be and...uh...all the leaders of the 
Zionist moveme nt wanted to hear from 
us. We  were the only people there from the o
ccupied territories. That is, from Ger many, 
Czechoslovakia, Austria. Nobody else there.
 Because nobody could get there. It never 
occurred to them for some reason or  other to
 send some  displaced persons over to tell the 
thing first person. There wasn't  a single one 
there. So we were busy. And the General 
ma de that possible because that's how he 
wanted to get rid of the Jews. (Laughter) 
Benevolently! So he did not court ma rtial me . 
He called me  in. Actually, it was the Chief 
Staff who ca lled me  in and said, "We got this
 TWX from Austria." "Yes, Sir." "What the 
Hell have you been up to?" "TWX tells you wh
at I have been up to." "We can't  allow 
this." I said, "No, I suppose not. What'
ll you do." He said, "We're moving you so you 
can't  do it." Alright, that was fine. Sylvia 
coul d keep the thing 
going and then other 
people took over. So far as I know some  tran
sports continue d to go until the communists 
took over Czechoslovaki a.

Q: I would like to halt a mi nute. 

 

A: Yal. 

 

A: Go back to London. 

 

A: Yal. 

 

Q: Uh...Something else happened, I believe, when you were in London. You me t Leo Bec k. 

 

A: Huh?  That has to do with Theres
ienstadt so we have to start. 
 

Q: Let's go back. Go back and do Theresienstadt because that leads to Leo Be ckŁ.Þ-HÞ
  
 
 

A: Yal. 

 

A: When I got to Prague the first time , I disc
overed there had been a concentration camp a t  
Theresienstadt, or as the Czechs call it Terezin, 
north and a little bit west of Prague. So I 
went there. There was still 16,000 Jews ther
e with a Russian unit...uh...running the camp 
because it wa s in a Russian zone. And...uh...The
resienstadt wa s exactly what...uh...all the 
pictur es have  ever shown it to be . It was an army  barracks...uh...and wasn't  bad, because 

Theresienstadt, I remi nd you, was the show-o
ff concentration camp. That was the place 
that the Red Cross came to. The Internationa
l Red Cross was not exactly heroic during 
World Wa r II, but they would go to Theresie
nstadt and ma ke inspection...inspections and 

then send out a report saying 
the concentration camp was fine. They had a band and gave 
concerts and they had classes and they did all 
sorts of things. What they didn't say is that 
everyday transports left for the east and that
 none of those people survived. Leo Beck had 

survived by accident , by the way. There was somebody else na me d Beck i n the camp, 

and they got mi xed up and they sent that Beck
 off to East instead of Leo Beck. Leo Beck 
had left by the time I got there. The Russians 
had flown hi m into the British zone, and the 
British ha d flown him to London where his 
only child, a daughter, lived. And...uh...We 
proceeded, the Russian and I, to ma ke a very 
si mple deal. He wanted to close the camp. 
We wanted to close the camp. UNRRA had agre
ed that they would take this people to a 

town called Begendorf in the American zone. It
 was just a case of getting them there, and 
I had trucks. So we ma de a deal to move all 
the Jews out of Theresienstadt to Begendorf 
and here I have to tell you another one of 
those absolutely uncanny 
coincidences. All of 
our conferences, the camp commander and I, to
ok place in the presence of a third person 
wearing a plain uniform who was the Commissa
r, the political leader, and he ran things. 
He sat there. Fortunately, he knew virt
ually no German. The only language the 
Commander  and I had in common was German. 
Mine was fairly bad, and his was even 
worse. So we were talking German t o each 
other, ma king ourselves understood and then I 
heard a word in a sentence that this ma n 
was saying, which was not German. It was a 
Yiddish word with a Hebrew origin. Aw, said I, He has just sent me  a signal. So in my 

next paragraph, I carefully used a Yiddish word
 that had a Hebrew origin. Neither of us 
blinked an eye lash, but we both knew why he 
was going to work his head off to get those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
11 
 
Jews out of there and he wanted me  to know why. I had a Jewi sh camp commander. 
Never again in the whole time I was there...thos
e...almost 3 months di
d he allude to it. 
We were never alone. The Commissar never le
t us alone. If I went there for lunch, the 
Commissar had lunch with us. He was with us
 every mi nute that I was in Theresienstadt. 
Ca me  the last day. The last transport leavi ng Theresienstadt for Dagendorf, trucks all 

lined up, my jeep ready, my driver excite
d, Vic, and...uh...suddenly was a scream toward 
the back of the transport, some body yelling 
"Halt." And a woma n, I re me mber her, a kind 
of heavy set lady climbe d out of the truck and 
started to run toward one of the buildings. 
So we followed her, the Ca mp President and I. She went into the building. She went 

down some  steps, around corners, down some
 more steps, way down into the bowels of 
the earth, and came to a...what looked like a 
piece of me tal cove
ring the wall, only it 
wasn't . It was a door. And when we went
 through that door, we were in the 
Theresienstadt synagogue. And...uh...it had not b
een completely cleaned out. There were 
some  things there, and we took them. One of
 the things was a Megillah, of Esther. And 

they wanted to give it to me , and I said, 
"No, that I thought it be
longed to Leo Beck." 
Whether or not it was his, it should be his. Th
ey all agreed that was so. He was a hero in 
the camp, by the way, because he had organized 
all those classes. He had insist ed after 
pulling his garbage truck all da
y that you could not let your mi
nd go to waste, and he had 
organized what amounted to a university. Anybody who could teach anything taught it. 

And he taught it. And that was...uh...accepted by these people as terribly important. And 

so he was...there have...there has been some  st
atements about Beck's status in the camp as 
being some thing less than heroic, but not in 
my conversations with people in that camp. 
They really respected this old ma n. So I said
 I would take it to hi
m, that one way or 
another eventually I would be going to London or
 I'd send it or whatever. So when I went 
to the Zionist Congress in July, I took the 
Megillah with me , wrapped in a piece of 
plastic, and I called, spoke to his daughter
 and ma de an appointme nt to see him on a 
particular day I don't remember. Whe n I ar
rived, I was taken through the house to the 
back garden. It was a little back British gardens which are so nice. And...uh...Leo Beck 

was a bit of a ham, and my later expe riences wi
th him confir me d the fact that he was a bit 

of a ha m. He was sitting...uh... reading some th
ing in profile. He had a ma rvelous profile, 
and the sun was shining directly on to him. (L
aughter) And we talked 
for awhile. I had to 
give him condolences. His niece...uh...had been k
illed in a truck accide nt on the way out 

of Theresienstadt, the only on toward thing th
at we  had in our Theresienstadt transports. 
A truck slid into the ditch and she was 
killed. His great niece was okay though. Her 
daughter! And we talked about that for awh
ile, and this young lady's future and I gave 
him the MegillahŁ. And he looked at it, and he
 looked at it, and he said, "I don't want 
this." I said, "Why not?  The people wanted you to 
have it." He said, "No. If I have it, it's 
a museum pi ece. The Megillah should not be a museum piece. It should be  a living 

document. It should be read. It should be read
 by Jews. This one be
ing the Theresienstadt 
Magila should be read under 
circumstances which connect th
e story of the Megillah with 
Theresienstadt. You take it. Only you promise me  that that's how it will be used." And I 

took it. I had a box ma de for it by a Holocaust
 survivor when I came back. Actually, I 
didn't have it made until I got to Washingt
on. And a woma n name d Friedal Blumenthal, a 

superb silversmith, ma de this box. The box is teac and she has orname nted it with 

appropriate symbols and the fact that it's a Me
gillah of Theresien. It
 is now going into its 
second generation. Whe n I retired, I gave it to 
my son who happens to be a Rabbi, and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
12 
 
uses it in his congregation and he has ma
de a...an arrangement with the Holocaust 
Museum that it will be on display here for part
 of each year. That's my first meeting with 
Leo Beck. Later, he taught me. He ca me to Cincinnati in 1948, and from 1948 until his 
death in 55, I think it was, he taught one seme
ster each year at the college institute in 
Cincinnati and the rest of the year wa s in London where he lead the World Union For 

Progressive Judaism. First rate lecturer 
and a bit of a ha m. Uh...Now whe r e do we go 
from here? 
 

Q: What I want to do from here is to go b
ack?  Uh...I want to...I do 
not yet want to leave 
Czechoslovakia. Uh...And I would like to
 know...You worked so closely with the 
Haganah, and you worked with Berichah. I would like for you to talk a little bit about 

that. Uh...Tell us who you worked with a
nd what those relatio
nships were like. 
 

A: Okay, then I'll have to 
talk about the girls too. 
 

Q: Yes. I want to do all of them. 

 

A: The people I worked with were primaril
y my American truck drivers. Andy Dunn and 
Faye Green at Camp Kar l of...uh...I don't re me mb er the name s  of anybody from the 

Rothchild Hospital, but there was an offi
ce there in which these documents...uh...which 
we did about 4 or 5 hundred eventually, these one-page things with
 the red stamp, that 
...uh...got these people. They neve
r had trouble getting from 
Prague to Pl zen traveling. 
Even after the...uh...cold war was declared, and 
I had to go back roads my last couple of 
trips to Theresienstadt, by the way. I could 
not just go across. I ha
d to go through a back 
road that I found to get to Theresin and then 
I could get to Prague and then I had to go 
back to my road to get back into the 
American zone because the Russians would no 
longer let us travel. My 3ªlanguage pass was 
no longer acceptable. Even after that, United 
Nations displaced persons traveling from Pra
gue to Plzen for the purpose of looking for 

relatives had no trouble getting through the 
border crossing at Brockisoni. So I don't 
reme mber names very well. I reme mber 
nobody from the Jewish Brigade group. Sylvia 
had ma de contact with a ma n na me d, who had 
been a Captain in the Je wish Brigade, and 
, an attorney and I heard of hi m subsequent 
over the years. I never me t him. So I had no 
dealings directly with him. I dealt with
 whoever happened to come  across with the 
ambulances or the trucks or the combination 
that was taking our people from the town in 
Austria across to Italy. It 
was pretty much a...uh...two-person operation, Sylvia and me . 
Sylvia worked day and night. She was absolute
ly incredible in that Red Cross thing of 
hers. Her four people, the other women knew 
exactly what was going on, and they helped 
as much as they could. They wanted to. They were nice, healthy American kids 

who...uh...got a little bit bored list
ening to G.I. stories from 9 o'clock to 9 o'clock and 
handing out donuts and coffee, which is all 
Red Cross...un...canteens served. They got 
tired ma king those donuts too. So...uh...I di
dn't have a great ma ny...uh....Berichah 
contacts then. Later it...uh...it change d dras
tically. But, the Czechoslova ki a thing was 
pretty much as I have described it. U
h...One ...uh...group of people I really have to 
mention because they become so i mportant to me. Shortly after we got to 

Czechoslovakia, I kept  hearing about places 
where there were Jews and that's  why the 

Chaplain had such trouble with my trip tick
ets because I went to all these places. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
13 
 
incidentally ma naged to show up at all the 
American Headquarters I was supposed to go 
to. There was a town in, a town in the southe
rn part of ... And I heard that there some  
Jewish girls there. Wo men! And I went dow
n there, and sure enough, there were. Nearly 
400 of them in a hospital. They had been 
in a labor camp in Germany and the Germans 
who were really suicidal a
bout Jews had put these wome
n...more than 400, nearly a 
thousand.... on to a train and sent 
the train east. Toward the end 
of the war, they did that 
with a lot of Jews. Their mi nds, I think, goi
ng like...we don't want the Americans to find 
them. It will be better for us if the Americans don't find the m. These wome n got as far as 

Suchita when they couldn't  get any more fuel
 for the train. So the engineer abandoned the 
train, and there they were. Some body ope
ned it up because they heard screams 
presumably, and they buried the dead and put th
e rest of them into this hospital. I went 
there and met these wome n. They wanted a serv
ice, so we had services, after which one 
young woman came up to me , introduced herself 
in quite good English, told me  that she 
and her three sisters and three of their fr
iends, all from Krakow, had been together 

through the war. Turns out that she ma ma 'd 
this group and saved them through the war. 
And...uh...they wanted to get out of the hospita
l. Was there any place they could live?  
Because she had been offered a job with 
UNRRA, and one of the others was going to 
this, one of the others was going to do that. 
They all had plans for living in Suchison, so 
we got them a house. And...uh...they became 
my kids. Uh...The word kid is funny 
because Erna  is really only about 5 year
s younger than I am, and the man she married 
was older than I. But...uh...They're my kinds. 
A little later...uh...the j
ob situation was such 
that they would do better in the Bavarian to
wn of Tishinroit, so they were moved to a 
house in Tishinroit, where they lived until 
they came  to...well, 1946, Bronya, now Betty, 
ma rried Henry and they moved to Australia wh
ere his only living relative was, and they 
are still there and we still correspond. I ha
ve not seen them since 1946. Uh...Dora, who 
was the housekeeper....she was the dome sticated
 one of this crowd...ma rried Borrof, and 
they disappeared in the wilds of Brooklyn, wh
ere he is a Hasid and does not permit his 
wife to have much to do with the rest of us. 
But Dora manages to call Erna periodically to 
ma ke sure everybody is alright and to send her 
love. The other five have been together 
constantly ever since. They all came to th
e United States. They all ma rried. Two of 
them...three of them married in Europe. 
I officiated at all three ma rriages. 
And...uh...some of the kids were born in Tirsenro
it, including a pair of twins, who are 
now both M.D., Ph.Ds doing extraordinary work. Uh...They've rema ined my fa mily to 

this day. Uh...Interestingly enough, the one 
who was not their sister...uh...married their 
uncle. They had a very uncle, and Maguska ma
rried him. So we've been through a lot of 
things. Births, Bar Mitzvah and a couple of d
eaths. Re ma rkably few deaths, I am glad to 
say. And we are still in routine comm
unication. Uh...Erna's marriage was rather 
mi raculous because in the concentration cam
p, she had met a woman who had said to her 
that she was absolutely perfect as a mate fo
r her son. And after the 
war she ma rried that 
son, a physician who had a successful practice 
in Syracuse. The coincide nces are such. 
Anyhow, that's my – 
 

Q: We need to break tape. Let'
s change tapes at this point. 
  

Q: Okay. Uh...We are still in Czechoslovaki
a, and you said there was a story that you 
wanted to tell me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
14 
 
 
A: Not everything that happened in Czechoslova
ki a (clearing throat) or
 anywhere else was 
upbeat. There were problems. There were trag
edies and there were 
horrors. Uh...I'll tell 
you a horror story just because it happened. Th
e Karlov camp was our salvation, but there 

were problems there too. One mi ddle of the ni
ght, I got a frantic call from Andy Dunn to 
come  out i mme diately, so I went over to the camp. It seems...uh...a Kapo had turned up in 

the camp. A Kapo was a Jew who wo rked for th
e Germans or Poles in the concentration 
camp, and if the Jews hated anybody more than
 they hated Ge rmans and Poles and other 
people, they hated Kapos. So
me body recognized this Kapo in Ka
rlov that night, and they 
had killed him and they just tossed his 
body over the fence outsid
e the camp, and the 
body had been found. And poor Andy didn't know what to do with a dead Kapo, and that 

was understandable. And...uh...It seemed to me  that
 to inform the Czech authorities was a 
bad idea. So we just buried the guy. A
nd...uh...he, like ma ny other Jews, lies in an 
unma rked grave. My own feeli
ngs that night ma de that one 
of the low points of the entire 
3 year experience in Germany. Uh...It's not my only Kapo experience. We had another 

one, but...tha t Jews could kill some body, anothe
r Jew. No ma tter how terrible the other 
Jew was, with no due process of any kind, outraged me  and upset me  and scared me . 

But...uh..it was another lesson to 
be learned. Let's go from that
 to a birth. A woma n ca me  
to Sylvia, Hungarian Jewish girl who was ve
ry pregnant and who di
dn't want the baby.  
The father of the baby was a concentrati
on camp guard. Following liberation she had me t 
a ma n, a Hungarian, who wanted to ma rry her,
 only he wouldn't ma rry her with the baby. 
It didn't bother him that she was pregnant. Af
ter all, she had nothing to do with that 
really, but...uh... he wasn't  going to raise that 
child and neither was 
she. What should we 
do with this baby about to be born?  Sylvia sa
id, "Give it to me. I will somehow get it to 
the United St ates. I have a sister who does not 
have children. That will be her child." And 
on June 1...July 1...July 1, 1945, this baby was 
born. A little girl. And the doctor who 
delivered her, I reme mb er his name . Intere
stingly enough his son, who was very young at 
the time, became my friend because of this in
cide nt and the son died in Ca lifornia just 
about 2 weeks ago to my sorrow. Uh...Here was this baby. The mother agreed that she 

would keep the child until she was ready to le
ave for Hungary. Five days later she came  
into the club after 10 o'clock one night and said, 
"I can't  do this. I have 
no interest in this 
baby. Why should I waste time looking after th
is kid?  Here." And handed a baby to 
Sylvia. Sylvia and four Red Cross girls found 
themselves the mother of a 5 day old baby, 
and I became it's sort of surrogate father. Th
e child lived in the Red Cross Club. The five 
wome n took care of her. The...uh...story of
 how we found... Well, bottles were easy. 
Coke bottles worked fi ne. You sterilize a coke
 bottle, and we had lots of coke bottles 
around. Nipples were harder to find. It took almo st a whole day of tearing around 

Czechoslovakia until we found one nipple for this 
kid that would fit a coke bottle. That's 
part of the problem. (Laughter) It was big e
nough for a calf as a ma tter of fact, but the 
baby thrived on it which is what ma ttered. We
 had no trouble with 
the other necessities 
for a young baby. And then in very dramatic
 fashion...uh...Sylvia had to come  home  on 
emergency in the summe r  of 1945. Her father was desperately sick and did, in fact, die. 

So she got emergency leave to go home  and she packed up the baby in a bed roll and took 

her along with her. When she got to Scotla
nd to get on the Tr ansa
tlantic plane they 
wanted...uh...baby's not on the ma nifest. And Sylv ia said, "Who puts 2 month old babies 

on a ma nifes t? "  "Where did you get the child."
 "It's my child. I had a baby." And she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
15 
 
bluffed her way through immi gration into the 
United States. And her sister got the child 
and the child is, I understand, ve
ry healthy and alive. We  changed her birthdate. On the 
birth certificate, which...uh...ha
ppened under extreme circums t ances also, it must have 
been...oh...a year later, I guess. No....a year and a 
half later, I got a frantic letter from the 
child's mother saying, "We 're trying to comp
lete the adoption and the court will not put 
through the adoption without a 
birth certificate. Get me  
a birth certificate." The 
communist had taken over in Czechoslovakia an
d I wasn't  about to go to Pl zen trying to  
get a birth certification. So I went to 
my Comma nding Officer and I said to him, 
"Colonel, is it true that all 
camp commanders and post comma
nders are notaries." "Yes." 
"Would you notarize a docume nt for me ? "  "Yes
." So in my na me , I wrote a statement 
about the circumstances of this child's birth, 
never alluding to the child's name  or mother 
because I wasn't  going to lie...uh...not in a sw
orn affidavit. I'm a funny American...uh...in 
view of the stories I am telling you, it sounds st
range that I would lie in an affidavit, but I 
didn't want to. So I wrote it very carefully. To
ld the circumstances of the child's birth and 
the move me nt to the United States, and...uh...civil
 affairs were not exactly in order Pl zen 
in July of 1945 and there was no birth certificate, and would the court please accept this 

sworn affidavit in lieu of a birth certificat
e, and they did. And so the adoption was 
completed. Uh...That's one of my nice stories. 
I hope you can get to Sylv
ia to get the rest 
of it because she tells it beau
tifully and I don't want to tell more because the young lady 
is around. The young lady and I have no contact 
whatsoever. I have not tried to keep 
these kinds of contacts. Okay. Let's now go to
 the USO. We 'l l finish up Czechoslovakia. 
USO tours were very important, especially
 during the occupation period. American 
soldiers were bored, and these entertainers came and...uh...you know, you've seen 

television pictures of Bob Hope and the crowd 
he gets. We ll, every group that came  over, 
no ma tter how me diocre got this ki nd of recep
tion. I was called in by our special services 
officer in Plzen and asked if I could do th
em a fa vor. I said, "What do you want?" He 
said, "Well, we have a strange USO group co
mi ng over. They have let it be known that 
they will not under any circumstances do the j
ob they'r e being sent here to do, name l y to 

entertain American troops, unless they can al
so go to Jewish displaced persons groups. 
And they'r e important people. So I want to 
indulge them. Can you help me ." I said, "Yal. 
I can help you. I can ma ke arrangement for 
concerts and appearances in Jewish DP 
camps." "Alright, they are arriving day after 
tomorrow. WI ll you meet them at the hotel?" 
"Yes." And I walked into a room which 
contained, and now I am na me  dr opping, the 

only time I shall do this I hope, Ingrid Berg
ma n, Jack Benny, Larry Addler, the world's 
greatest harmonica player and Ma
rtha Tilton of whom I had ne
ver heard till then, but who 
turns out to be a very good pop singer. And...uh...the
y said to me  that they wanted to do 
this. I said, "What do you want to do for thes
e Jews? "  "Leave that up to us." And I took 
them in a command car for one solid week during the day. After all American troops 

could not be entertaine d...until 11:00 in the mo
rning or 2:00 in the afternoon, they were 
supposed to be working. But Jews were sitti
ng around. They spent their days entertaining 
Jews, and their evenings entertaining Ameri
can troops. And they were ma gnificent. They 

were absolutely superb. Jack Benny's Yiddi
sh was quite good. Larry Addler's  Yiddish 
was quite good. Uh...Ingrid Bergma n talked to
 them in a broken kind of German which 
she broke deliberately so they wouldn't  thi
nk it was Yiddish, and (l
aughter) they knew it 
wasn't  and...uh...I had a wonderful time  fora week. I really did. I was...uh...the only 

spectator at about 1 o'clock one mor ning to
 a recital in which Jack Benny played the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
16 
 
piano and La rry Addler played th
e violin. I wish I had a tape 
of that one. I wish the world 
had a tape of it. It was a r
eally spectacular experience, a
nd I developed enormous regard 
for those four people because they really
 knocked themselves out for these Jews.  
 
Q: Okay. Uh...You were done with your Czech 
tour  in Czechoslovakia and you were sent to 
Germany?  
 

A: I was exiled to Germany.  

 

Q: You were exiled to Germany. 

 

A: Yes. I was...uh...assigned to the 4th Ar mored 
Division, one of its comba t  commands. In 
those days a armored division consisted of 
three combat commands. I wa s assigned to 
one of them in a little town not far fr
om Regensburg. And...uh...it didn't take long to fi nd 
Jews. There were 2,000 of them in Regensburg, not under UNRRA auspices, which 

means they needed everything in the world and 
we had to work there. One of the things 
we got them was a building, a Jewish Center. 
It had an auditorium. It had offices cause 
they organized. Two thousand Jews are either 
organized or you have chaos. One or the 

other! By this time, incidentally, it's 
the very end of August 1945. And I was very 
worried. We  had inadequate food for these 
people and no money to get food. I had 
written to the JVC in Paris, trying to
 get money and we could buy food, and...uh...was 
told no, this was not the way they wanted to
 do business, that they would be comi ng in 
with their people and they would take 
care of everything. Meanwhile, we had hungry 
Jews. Uh...I guess the first thing to tell you is
 the meeting of Chaplains, which happened 
shortly after I got to Regensburg or... I am going to call it Regensburg. It was really a 

little town called Zoul, but it doesn't ma tter. 
Uh...Got instructions 
to be Munich at a 
certain time  to meet with the Chair of the Commis sion of Ar my and Navy Chaplaincy of 

the Jewish Welfare Board of the late Rabbi 
Joseph Lipstein, an orthodox rabbi, and with 
Rabbi  who was a director of that commi
ssion, who was a reform rabbi. And we all 

gathered in this hotel room in Munich. My 
guess is there were probably 30 or 40 of us. 
Uh...There were about 90 Jewish Chaplains in 
the American Zones, but they weren't...he 
didn't meet them all at once. He had met so
me in Frankfurt and he met them...I don't  

know where else. But he me t us in Munic
h, and that was the fi rst time I had seen 
Klausner...uh...since Dachau because I had just 
gotten back to Germany, and had not had 
a chance to go down in Munich to see him.
 And...uh...I'll never forget Lipstein. He 
greeted us and he said, "Now Gentleme n, 
my report to the Jewish We lfare Board on 
Chaplain activities, I wrot e on the pl ane comi
ng over. It was easy. Now I want to know, 
and if you trust me , don't  hold back. Tell me
 wha t 's  going on." And we looked at one 
another, and we decided we'd 
tell him. So we told him. We had lots of problems, and 
nothing to deal with them w
ith. Uh...Abe was the most outspoken and said the most 
because he ha d the most experience by then. I should tell you that by then, you see, he 

had organized the Central Committee of Displace
d Persons in the U.S. zone of which he 
was the president. And he had departme nts 
set up. They were doing health work. They 
were getting food and clothing where they
 could scrounge it, 
and I guess most of 
important of all, they were 
doing a relative search. Uh...Abe
 published five volumes of 
name s of survivors which sat in Muni ch in 
the old Dorchus museum which was his office 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
17 
 
then and on the walls of this bui
lding...I wish we had pictures
 of it...I think he does...are 
the name s of thousands of Jews and where to 
find them so they could find relatives. And 
relatives were found this way. It was a very
 inefficient way, but it was the only way we 
had so we used it. And...uh.. during that mee
ting with Lipstein not participating, the 
chaplains decided that our pe
ople had a right to clothing, a
nd they weren't getting it and 
there was no indication that when JDC or 
anybody else would come  in to give people 
clothing who weren't in DP ca mps. And even in some  DP camps they didn't have 
clothing. They particularly didn't have clothing for children. Our people we re beginning 

to have kids if you can count. And...uh...we deci
ded we would use a technique which was 
legal which the Army permitted. You in the 
United States could send to any soldier 
anywhere in the world a 11-pound package 
of food and or clothing...uh...to his A.P.O. 
number, and you could send as ma ny as you want
ed. So each of us wrote letters, and we  

sent them to everybody we knew. I sent them 
to every Rabbi I knew. I sent them to my 

fa mily. I have a large family, and all my 
friends and everybody else I could think of. 
Send packages. And God helps us, they began 
to come  in. Tons. By the end of October 
1945, I had 80 people working full time  in a wa
rehouse in Re gensburg on just the stuff 
addressed to me, sorting this 
clothing, throwing away some  of it I am sorry to say or 
using it for smotas and fixing that which was 
repairable and getti
ng it cleaned and once a 
week I visited all of the 31 camps and communities in my part of north Bavaria 

delivering sacks of this stuff. I began to worry about my pos t office. So I went to my 

postal officer and I said, "People in the United 
States are sending me  a lot of stuff as you 
know." He said, "Yes, Chaplain, I am aware of 
it." I said, "How about it if I make it easy 
on you and I send a truck down here everyday to
 pick up the stuff so you don't have to 
deliver it." "Oh, that will be wonderful. Th
ank you." He didn't ask a question. I didn't 
give him any information. (laughing) I just
 sent the truck, and we got our stuff. 
Absolutely incredible quantities. Tons a
nd tons of clothing. Now people began to ask 
questions. We give contributions to the Jo
int Dist ribution Committee which is supposed 

to be doing relief work all over the world. 
How come  we get asked by the Rabbis for 

these packages?  And that must have been....m
ust have been embarrassing to JDC but by 
that time, I am afraid we weren't very sy
mpathetic. Uh...When they came in, they came 
into my territory...uh...no...they came into Munc
h in August...three social workers. Not 
carrying a stitch of anythingwith them, and no budget for an
ything. Klausner got them 
him a house. As he had a house in Munich and 
he brought them into 
his house, and that 
became their headquarters cause they had no 
place to work. They were credited to 
UNRRA, but UNRRA didn't supply them with 
anything. It wasn't  UNRRA's  job. It was 
their job to be supplying. These people were
 absolutely unprepared for what they were 
going to do. They didn't know anything about 
relative search. They didn't know anything 
about getting people out, if you could get pe
ople out. They had not been trained. Of 
course, neither had we. One of the astounding f
acts of my life is th
at those of us who 
went to Europe got absolutely no orientat
ion from anybody about what we were going to 
find when we got there. None. Not from th
e JWB, which...whose job it wasn't , but not 
from the other agencies either who really mi
ght have gotten a hold of
 us before we left 
and said, "Hey, you're going to run into A, B, 
C. and D, and contact so and so and so and 
so, and at least know the address of the 
JDC office in Paris which none of us had. 
So...uh...those relationships...uh... were either
 strained or good, depending on the 
personnel. Two of the three people who came to Munich were ma gnificent as people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135

Ceil Wi neburg, I shall always...ma rried a ma n...u
h...died in De troit, was superb. And she 
wouldn't leave Europe. She got so attached to
 those people and their 
needs that she must 
have stayed 5 years. Uh...The other one, a gi
rl name d Debbie, I am sorry to say died in 
Europe...uh...a defective heating stove...uh...i
n her room. This happened in 1946. So. 
 
A: Another thing we had to do... 

 

Q: Tell me  mor e  about JDC and this. 

 

A: (Sigh) We ll, I was lucky. In late Octobe
r, early November, there came to Regensburg, a 
full time JDC person name d Joe Levine, who now
 lives in Fort Wa yne, Indiana, deeply 
devoted, cared about these peopl
e and did everything in the wo
rld that could be done. He 
even learned how to scrounge, and he learned 
how to steal, and he learned how to send 
for this and that not through JDC channels, a
nd eventually JDC ma naged to get stuff in. I 
mean it didn't stay this way forever. But t
hose...that first year was pretty horrendous and 
Joe was as frustrated as I was. Fortunately, 
we became very close friends and we were on 

the same  wave length from beginning to e
nd. We  are still good fr
iends, by the way. High 
Holidays, 1945, I must tell you. Had to do some thing. Not only for soldiers, but for 

displaced persons as well. And I decided that 
they were decided...that they were entitled 
to have a break fast at the 
end of Yom Kippur which would 
be traditional. What do you 
need for a break fast?  Herring. You gotta ha
ve herring. Without herring you can't do it. 
How do you get herring? There's no herring in 
Re gensburg. Legal, illegal, no herring. So 
I cabled military to a Chaplain fri end in England and said, I need a big barrel of salt 

herring, enough for 2,000 people for break fast
. One day in August...late August, 1945, 
beginning Se ptember, I don't re me mber the dates at this point, I got a phone call. Munich 

airstrip. "Are you Chaplain Lipman?" "At the 
end of our runway is the biggest God Dam 
barrel (you'll have to censor that) I have s
een and it stinks." "I
'll be right down." 
(Laughter) I put my trailer on my jeep, and I 
went to the air strip 
and we unloaded what 
was an enormous barrel. You think of a barrel 
as this big. It wa s three time s that big. Was 
almost as tall as I. We couldn't lift it. It 
had to be rolled. And I 
took it up to Ragensberg, 
and said, "Now what do I do with it?  How do I make this into pickled he rring, because it 

was old salt herring, in brine, 
untouched. It had its heads. It
 had had its scales. It had 
everything. Then I got an idea. My comma
nding officer was a Colonel Koen. We  were 

not friends, I am sorry to say. He should rest 
in peace. Harold Kone was not very Jewi sh. 
He was part of the fa mous teams of Abra
hams in Kone. The 4th Armored Division had 
been hell on wheels for the Germans. Th
ey had hated the 4th Ar mored, and they 
particularly Abrahams  a nd Koen. They thought
 they were both Jews. Abrahams  was t he 
late General Kritein, Abrahams of Vi et Na
m fa me who was then a Colonel, and was 
Harold Koen's  commander. He commande
d the combat command. Harold...No, he 
commanded the regime nt. Harold had the comb
at command. Harold Koen taught Kreitein 
Abrahams s o me  Yiddish and to the extent they
 could on their walky talkies, they talked 
Yiddish. And the Germans called them terriblename s, these two Jews. But that was as 

Jewish as Ha rold Koen got. He was not interest
ed in me . He was not interested in what I 
was doing, and so we kept away from each othe
r. I went in to him and I said, "Harold, I 
need some thing, and ma ybe this will appeal 
to you. I need some  PW
s, a bunch of them 
for a whole day." "What for? " I said, "To cl
ean herring." And he said, "What? " I said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
19 
 
"Yal, I got a barrel of herring here, a big barrel for both our troops and for the Jews in 
Regensburg for Yom Kippur." A
nd he said, "Oh, how beautiful." We  had a PW cage for 
high ranking officers. He gave me  10 Colonels, 
10 Nazi Colonels, who arrived in step in 
uniform, and I said to them, "Gentleme n, I s
uggest to you that you take off as much of 

your uniforms as you c a n because the task you ha
ve is not going to be exactly..." "We are 
forbidden to do menial labor. We are offi cers.
" I said, "I  am aware of that , and we will 

keep the Geneva Convention. We  will not smas
h it. We may bend it a bit before the day 
is over." I sat them down on re
latively low stools with big buc
kets in front of them, put 
the barrel of herring in front of them, and 
said, "Gentleme n, you are to cut off the heads. 
You are scale it. You are to gut it. And then
 put it into these buck
ets of water." They 
refused. And I said, "Here's the written order 
from Colonel Koen. I am not sure what you 
can do about it. You are, after 
all, prisoners of war." They sat down and they spent 10 
hours...it was a pretty hot day...cleaning he
rring. I loved every mi nute of it. I was a 
sadistic so and so. Koen must have come  
out 10 time s to watch it. He had a ma rvelous 
time that day. And then when they went b
ack...uh...the herring having been cleaned, they 
dema nded baths. And the camp commander said, "But it's not your bath day. You'll get 

your bath day on your bath day." And so thes e guys walked around r
eeking of herring for 
I don't know how ma ny days until
 their bath day came, and 
I must tell you I had no 
compassion. I confess that I am not that 
human, or humane. So we ma de  enormous 
quantities of pickled herring. I found some  other things that the commissary or the... our 

supply group was willing to let me steal a
nd then I got 4,000 donuts from our Red Cross 
people. Had lots and lots and lots of coffee a
nd all the rest of it. And then I got a break. 
The 4th Armored Division was a New York Di
vision and organized 
at Ca mp Pine. And 
of its 10,000 people when it was full strength, 
almost 15 hundred were Jews. It had the 
highest casualty rates in Jews 
of any unit in the United States
 Ar my I suspect because 4th 
Ar mored had been through very heavy co
mbat. Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom 
Kippur, the high point me n got 
their orders to go home. I 
had over a thousand me n at 
Rosh Hashanah services. I had 80 at Yom Ki
ppur  services. They had left me . (Laughter) 
They had gone home. I was delighted for them. I  was delighted for another reason too. I 

had that much more food for my DPs. We  fi
nished early. I de liberately st arted services 

early and finished early, so 
we could all get into Regens
burg. And all these guys that 
wanted to go...some of them drove trucks fo
r me ...had this food all loaded and we went 
into Regensburg and we parked our trucks in 
front of the Jewish Center where the Jews 
were dining. And...uh...somebody looked in oneof the trucks. They didn't know I was 

comi ng. I had not told them we were bringi
ng a meal. And I am not sure they ever 
finished the meal that day. They unloaded those 
trucks faster than I ha
ve ever seen trucks 
unloaded, and that food disappeared. I stood 
in there. I had such a wonderful time 
watching these people break fast as you're 
supposed to break fast. It was a quite 

me morable experience. Lots of other a
dventures in Regensburg,...uh...including my 
second kapo. I came into the center one day, and 
they were screaming and yelling at this 
poor, bedraggled looking Jew who was a ka
po, and I said, "You are not going to do 
anything in this center." And we asked quest
ions. The guy admitted that he  had been a 
kapo, so we had no trouble with that. And I 
said to the Jews, "Was being a kapo a war 
crime? " "Yes." "What do we do with war crimin
als?  We  try them. I a m ta king this Jew to 
military government, and I am having him arrested as a war criminal and the Allied 

Ar mi es will try this war criminal as we 
are trying war criminals and you won't touch 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
20 
 
him." And t hey screame d and they yelled I was 
a traitor. They were going to kill this guy. 
The least they could do was get there vengeance, et
c., etc., etc. And I said to my assistant, 
a wonderful Jew name d Si Pova, who lives 
in Hartford, Connecticut. He's  a social 
worker. He raised an orthodox fa mily. He was 19 years old. They called him , Si mon, the 
righteous one. And he was. Si must have 
worked 20 hours a day, 6 days a week for these 
people. He was absolutely ma gnificent. I said
 to Si, "Si, you have to do some thing. Don't 
say anything. Just go, unhook your carbine out of
 the rack in the jeep and bring it up 
here." And he did. And I said to the Jews, "Si,
  here has a gun. Woul
dn't it be terrible if 
he had to use it. But we want to use it rath
er than let you kill this Jew." And we marched 
the Jew out and turned hi m over the military government, and I can't  tell you what 

became of him. That was my war criminal. It 
took awhile for the people in Regensburg to 
forgive me . They were very angry, and I 
understand their anger. But that's  what...our 
Hasidic style. We  changed hats and we dan
ced and we went absolutely bananas and 5 
o'clock in the afternoon when I went b
ack to my hotel....I ma naged to stagger 
in...uh...they had finished  yet because they had danced so long. And...uh...I had an 

incident  with my antiªHasidic grandfather as
 a result of that day. I ma de a mi stake. 
Before I sobered up, I wrote him a letter, tel
ling him of the wonderful time I had had with 
those people and that I wanted
 to see more of them. He wr
ote me  back. We corresponded 
always in He brew. From the time  that I wa
s 7 years old, I got only Hebrew letters from 

my grandfather, who figured I was smart 
enough to get some body to translate them for 
me for the parts I couldn't  translate myself
. And he had beautiful handwriting. So I got 
this letter by return ma il which sort of crinkl
ed the edges of the pape
r in which he said, "I 
have your letter. I want to remi nd you of so
me thing. When you wrote me  to Jerusalem 
that you had decided to become  a refor m Ra
bbi I didn't argue with you. I thought about it. 
After all, your father was a businessman a
nd an atheist. At least, you weren't going in 
either of those directions. To become  a Ra
bbi, even a reform Rabbi you would have to 
study. You would know some thing, which is mo re than most Jews did, so reme mber I 
didn't fight with you. But, if you become  a 
Hasid, don't come home. And he signed the 
thing. (Laughter) One of my favorite all-tim
e letters from the old ma n. Okay. We  now 
move into...uh...Nove mber. We  got theater orde
rs that any Chaplain who could was to 
report to Paris in time  for a theater wide 
me morial service on Nove mber 11, the speaker 
at which would be David Ben-Gurion, and it wo
uld be held in the Synagogue in Paris. 
And I didn't want to go. Joe and I had a lot of things going, 31 camps and 

communities...uh...the package syst em is working. I'll have to tell you about the ma il 

system which was also working. I didn't really
 want to go. And my Se
nior Chaplain said, 
"Gene, go." I said, "Why?" 
He said, "You're too tired. You don't look good. Just don't 
like the way you look." And Si Pava said, "Y
ou're pain a neck these days. You're 
irritable. You're terrible. Go 
to Paris." said, "Pava, you just 
wa nt to go to Paris." He says, 
"I want to be at that serv
ice. I ought to be there." And 
I said, "Pava, you've  earned the 
right. Let's go." So we went. Snowed the 
whole bloody way across Europe. We  had to go 
by jeep. There was no other way to go a
nd...uh...it was not exactly a happy, happy ride, 
but we ma de  it. And one of the most frigid e
xperiences of my entire 
life was that service 
at the Synagogue. Not the atmosphere, but 
it was cold. There was no heat in this 
synagogue. We were all sitting there in our 
gray coats, and Ben Gurion hung a on us. He 

ma de a long, long speech. I had been instruct
ed by my Berichah people to see Ruth 
Kluger in Paris, at the Haganah office. Ha
ganah had an office in Paris. European

headquarters. So I wondered in there, and we
 were talking, Ruth and I, about what was 
going on in Germany and Czechoslovakia and 
what we needed and how we could do a 
better job of moving Jews when her phone ra
ng. And from the conversation at my...at our 
end, it was clear that she was talking to 
Judge Simon Riskin who had arrived...I don't 
reme mber how ma ny we eks earlier...as the 
advisor to General Eisenhower on Jewish 
Affairs, with a rank of Lieutenant General. 
And they were talking about a deal which Ben 
Guron had ma de with Eisenhower just before 
Ben Guron came  to Paris for the service. 
The deal in which teachers would be sent 
from Palestine to the DP camps to teach 
Hebrew, to teach agronomy. All of those te
achers would be Haganah people, and the 
Army would try to turn its 
back to the ma ximu m possible 
extent to let them operate. 
Eisenhower asked one thing. You will not br
ibe any American soldier. You will not 
corrupt my me n. I 'll help you get around th
em, but you're not going through them. And 
Ben-Gurion thought that ma de good s e nse. So 
they wanted to get going. The Army ha d 
an airplane ready to go to...uh...w
hat is now Ben Guron airport, then called LudŁ to pick 
up the first group to bring them. And it sudde
nly occurred to Judge Riskin that an 
American crew flying into Lud wouldn't know 
what to do with itself when it got there. 
That some  liaison person was necessary, a
nd Ruth agreed that a liaison person was 
necessary. And she looked at me  and suddenly sh
e said to Judge Riskin, "I think I have 
the person sitting right here. 
Shall I put him on the phone." And I introduced myself a nd 

Judge RiskinŁ said, "If Ruth thinks you're the 
person to do this, then it's alright with me . 
Can you be here tomorrow morning?" I said, 
"If I drive all night, 
I can." He said, "So 
drive all night." Lieutenant Generals are like 
this, and Simon Riskin is
 like this too. He's  a 
very blunt...uh...guy who had given up a place 
on a Federal District benc h, a life 

appointme nt, to take on this temporary th
ing, to work for Eisenhower and do Jewish 
things. He was wonderful. So I found Si with no trouble. We  had a terrible time finding 

our other driver who was carousing Pa ris, bu
t we caught up with him and we loaded him 
in the back of the jeep because he couldn't 
drive and the two of us drove all ni ght. We 

reported to Judge Riskin in Frankfort the ne
xt morning. Uh...the morning following that, I 
was on a B-17, with a crew of five Ameri
cans heading for... Uh...Bewildered. Excited. I 
had my orde rs from General Walter Bedel Sm
ith, and they were for 7 days. Okay?  So I 
got into Delist. Got to Jerusalem, and di
scovered nothing was ready. Uh...Our Israel 
friends will all forgive me , but
 the Middle East is not exactly the most efficient place in 
the world to do business. Not then and not now
. Uh...I went to meetings and tried to get 

things going. There was no way to get those 
people out in 7 days. But I got a lot of 
questions that had to be answ
ered in Germany. So we flew back to Germany, went into 
conference with the various peopl
e at headquarters that were goi
ng to deal with this thing 
and...uh...got answers and flew back again. I ma de
 two trips in about 2 weeks I guess it 
was. My second trip was not long before
 Hanukkah. And...uh...while we were getting my 
14 people organized, a couple of 
incidents are worth me ntioning. First, my 7 day orders, 
the 7th day was a Shabbat. It was alright with me . I was under military orders and you do 

things under military orde rs. Bu
t 4 of my 14 teachers so-cal
led were orthodox Jews. They 
refused to fly on Shabbat. And I said, "What will give you permission to fly on Shabbat?" 

And they said, "Written authorization fr om th
e Chief Rabbi." I said, "Okay." So I called 
the Chief Rabbi's office and I talked with a ge
ntlema n who is now the President of Israel,  
the Chief Rabbi's  son, who was then his secr
etary. I told him what I wanted and he 
laughed and he said, "All of us are gonna ha
ve fun with that one." And...uh...he invited 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
22 
 
me  for Shebot dinner and I didn't accept beca
use I was having Shabbat dinner with the 
men who was really the political
 head of the Haganah, the first foreign mi nister of Israel, 
who I am de lighted to say became Es ther's
 and my very good friend. Uh...We loved him 
dearly. And I reme mber President Hertzog sayi
ng,  isn't going to like that. You don't t urn 
down an invitation to the Rabbi's  dish." And 
I said, "One is also not rude. One has to 
have . And I had accepted another invitation. 
Now would the Chief Rabbi call Sharet and 
give him reasons for me  not to go to Sharet
's  for Shabbat dinner? "  He said, "No, the 
Chief Rabbi will not do that." I said, "Fine. Y
ou'll give my apologies to the Rabbi. I have 
no choice whatsoever." But I went there late
 Friday afternoon, and the Ra bbi's  little 
synagogue and had an intervie
w with him before . His first question to me ...he spoke 
Hebrew and English and Yiddish with an Iri
sh accent. He had been Chief Rabbi in 
Dublin before he went to Palestine. Char
mi ng, wonderful little ma n. Hi s first question to 
me  was, "Is it true that you are Morris Ne
ma n's nephew?" And I said, "How did you ever 

hear of Morris Nema n? " And he said, "We kno
w things out here." I said, "Yes. I am hi s 
nephew." And he said, "You can't  be all bad, 
even if you're a reform Rabbi." I said, 
"Thank you for nothing." (Laughter) He gave me
 the piece of pape
r authorizing these 
guys to go on the grounds it was . Huma n life 
was  involved, and they had to fly out on 
Shabbat or not fly out. I would have to go without because I wasn't  going to get cour t 

ma rtialed for this bunch or anybody else. So
 we left on Shabbat. Chief Rabbi was 
wonderful. I was carrying with
 me  not only 14 some what scared Jews, but the most 
peculiar package I have ever ca
rried in my life. I had been 
called and asked to come  and 
see a ma n name d  Capla n, who was the treasure
r of the Jewish Agency, First Minister of 
Finance, with the Governme nt of Israel in 
1948. I walked into his office. This was before 
my meeting with the Chief Rabbi. And he said, "Are you really Morris Ne ma n's 

nephew?" I said, "Yes,"  and he offered me  c
ondolences because as it happens Morris ha d 
died in September of 45. One of the first thi
ngs I did in Jerusalem 
was go to the walls and 
say kottish for him. He was a great Zioni
st in Pittsburgh. A ma gni
ficent, ma gnificent 
ma n. My fa vorite uncle. So he said, "Okay, then
 I'll trust you." He sa
id, "I want you to do 
some thing for me . I want you to take a packag
e to Paris. I said, "B
ut I am not going to 
Paris." He said, "If you take this package you ar
e." I said, "What will be in the package?" 
And he said, "A quarter  of a million dollars." 
I said, "That's too big a package." (l aughter) 
for my purposes. He says, "No, it will fit in 
your shaving kit." I sa
id, "How? "  He said, 
"Because it's going to be in gold sovereigns. 
It's the budget for the Paris office for the 
next period of time." And I sa
id, "Alright. So I'll get cour
t ma rtialed. What can I do?" 
And he took me  through a door and through anot
her door into a room that consisted of 
shelves, each one of which was ma rked with
 a country. All currency. 
This was the Jewish 
Agency's  private treasury of foreign currenc
y. I don't know how much
 money was there. 
No idea. All I know is that he was correct. I got a quarter of million dollars in gold 

sovereigns into my docket. Then I wondered, "How'll I pull this off?  I am going to have 

to trust one of my pilots. And I got hold of
 the Major and I said to him, "Look. I am 
going to do some thing very dangerous. I am
 going to tell you some thing you don't want 
to know and I don't want to tell you, but I need
 you. I need you in two ways. I need you 
to protect me . I am going to be walking around for the rest of the time  we  are Palestine 

with my doc k kit in my hands, and I don't anybody to ask why. And I don't  want anybody 

to take it because it is money in it. A lot of
 mone y." "Okay, Chappy. It
's  alright with me ." 
I said, "Second of all, you are 
to arrange an emergency that 
makes us land in Paris for 1 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135

hour." "That's not as easy," he said. I 
said, "You'll do it thoug
h." I let them know 
approxima tely when we would be comi ng in, 
and we were me t at the airport by a ma n 
who became one of my most beloved friends
, Efriam Decal who is second in command 
of the  was the boss and Decal was hi s sec
ond. Decal has written extensively about the 
Berichah and about all sorts of things. He...uh...ha
s died. His wife is st
ill living I am glad 
to say. I just handed him this, and he, in e
ffect, said thank you. (L
aughter) That was our 
first meeting. We  became friends later. And 
we flew back to Germany. And we got away 
with it, which was alright. We  had some th
ing else on board, about which I was very 
sentimental and still am. I was invited to a m
eeting of the Vodlume, whic h is the National 
assembly of the Ishuf, headed by...uh...Ben , w
ho became the second President of Israel. 
And I me t all the people who 
are legendary. You name  the m a nd they were all sitting 
there, and I was introduced to all of them. A
nd Ben  said, "I need a favor." "What." The 
school children of Israel had been ma king Ha
nukiyot for the children of the DP ca mps in 
Germany. We have 36,000 of them. And we ha
ve candles. We don't  know how to get 
them to Germany. Nobody ever thought of th
at. I understand, he said, that you are flying 
in a bomber. I said, "Yes, and my bomber 
has bomb bays, and I think it would be very 
nice if we filled the bomb bays of a B-17with Hanukiyot and candl
es." And we did. And 

I sent a military TWX to Si Pava to alert ev
erybody he could alert to come  to the airport 
at Piece boden and pick up their Hanuki
yot and they did. All 36,000 of them got 
distributed in about 24 hours to Jews all 
over Germany, all over the American zone of 
Germany. And...uh...that was some  Hanukkah. By th
e way, I don't have one of them. We 
distributed them all. (Laughing) I never got one
. I would give much to have one of those 
Hanukiyot but I don't have one, and I guess that's
 proper and just that I should not have. I 
never went back to Regensburg to work. I spent the next  period of time until April 46 

running around, doing I don't know what, but th
ere were emergencie
s constantly. The 
American headquarters in Frankfort would ca
ll...the G.5 sections civil affairs, or 
Hiam...then called Hans Hoffman, later becameHiam Hoffma n, later became  , one of the 

fine people of Israel, and I ha
d to do things. So I was on de
tached service at Frankfort 
Headquarters for some  months, but that had to
 end. You just can't  keep doing that. So the 
theater Chaplain, a ma n name d Hunan, Catholic
, Truman's Chaplain, he called himself, 
from the first World War , called me in a
nd said, "You gotta stop this monkeying around. 
This isn't why you're in the Army. I am sendi
ng you to Berlin. That should be far enough 
away from all those displaced persons." And 
I said, "Yes, Sir." Excited, because the Jews 
from Poland and Russia had just started to come
 in and we were routing them all through 
Berlin. We  had one of the Haganah people stat
ioned in Berlin, and that's  where the action 
was going to be. Break my heart. Send me  to
 Berlin. Twenty four hours later, he called 
me  in and he said, "You're not going to Be
rlin. I just found out the stuff that's  going on 
there. You're going to Augsburg to the 1st 
Division." "Yes, Sir." "And," he said, "when 
you get there, find Chaplain Freedman, whom I assigned there, but who is now going to 

Berlin in your place." And I went to 
Augsburg and found He rb Freedma n, whom I had 
never me t before. A young, first lieutenant, fr
esh into the Army, who wa s angry at me  
because Augsburg is near Munich, and in M
unich is where the action was because he 
wanted to do Haganah work. He was busting to 
do this stuff. And I explained to him that 
Berlin was better and he should be made on 
me . (laughter) And he went to Berlin. Of 
course, Herb Freedman's career since then has 
been legendary. He and Phil Burstein did 
things that people really shouldn't have 
been able to do. And...uh...it was superb. I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
24 
 
delight ed to be in Augsburg. But my time was running out, because Hoffma n was 
negotiating with the Army to ma ke me  into 
a civilian because it was clear during this 
period from December when these 14 arrived that this , this Jewish agency for Palestine 

group, as it was called,...uh... was going to have 
constant dealings 
with the Army. And 
some  American had to be there to see to it 
that nothing got fouled up. And they decided I 
should be that person, and I was not unwilling. My
 condition was that my wife and child 
be allowed to come to Germany with me. I ha
d two reasons for that. First of all, I been 
away 18 mo nths and that's  a 
lot longer than 2 years...those 
2 years that I 
thought wouldn't 
be so long, and second of all, I felt that Esth
er had to experience this or we weren't going 

to have much of a life because I was no longer the person who had gone overseas. An 

awful lot had happened. Deeply, deeply tran
sformi ng stuff. And they agreed. Some body 
fouled up, and in April 1946, just before Passo
ver...uh...I got orders to go home  to be 
demobilized and I asked Heim about it and he 
sort of shrugged and we talked to Ruth 
Kluger in Paris who was theoretically ma
king these arrangeme nts and she sort of 
shrugged. So I came home. And I became a civi
lian. Uh...The re was an Haganah office in 
New York. It had been organized for a very
 simple purpose. Money. They had to buy 
ships. Ships are expensive. The only place th
ey really coul d buy ships was the United 
States because they wanted larger ships. Ships for 2 or 3 hundred people were not going 

to be able to do this thing 
anymore. They needed big ships. So they were going to buy 
them in the United States, and they se nt 4 Palestinians over, led by who later became , the 

fi rst chief of staff of the Israel  ar my, later the Pr esident of the  in Haifa. A marvelous, 

ma rvelous ma n. When I got to New York, I went
 into the office, naturally, and  asked me  
if I would go to work for them. As long as I 
had to be in the United States for a little 
while ma king speeches for the Haganah. So 
from the end of April 1946 until Febr uary 
1947, I was on the staff of the Haganah in th
e United States ma king speeches. Esther and 
I lived in New York. First in a hotel, but 
then we couldn't stand it. And Michael was 
getting sick in this 
hotel. The food just wasn't  for 
a 2 year old. And...uh...so we found an 
apartment on Staten Island, and we lived over 
there. It was not a good time. I was a way 
more than I was there....uh... ma king the same  speech over and over and over again to 

secret meetings of Jews to get money. Wa s not
 my style, but it was what had to be done. 

There was some compensation. There was a ra
iny night. I don't re me mbe r  what month 
when I was allowed to go to Baltimore. 
And down on the docks was a ship, then called 

the SS Warfield. The Warfield being the same 
person as the Duchess of Wi ndsor because 

her daddy was the President of the steamboat 
company that ran steamboats up around the 
Chesapeake Bay. This was a Chesapeake Bay steame r. Decrepit, me ssed up which the 

Haganah had bought, and we were sending off to 
Europe to transport Jews. We  estimated 

that ma ybe 25,000 Jews uncomfortable could ge
t on it. When it sailed in June of 47 to 

Palestine from France as the exodus 1947, 
it had 52 hundred people on board, and we'll 
pick that up later because I have more to 
do with the exodus. That night in Baltimore we 

commissioned the exodus in a non-existent Jewish navy. Gave it flag, 
and all the rest of 

the . A word ought to be said about Amer
icans for Haganah. It was an astonishing 
organization. It's head was a multi-milli
onaire oil ma n na me d Rudolph Sonaborn, whose 
last clai m to fa me was that 
he ma rried Dorothy Shift, the 
publisher of the New York Post 
then. But he gave at least ha
lf his time to Americans for 
Haganah. We  me t every Tuesday 
for lunch in a hotel in New York, and...uh... books 
have been written about this operation, 
which was clandestine. The bank account wa
s the bank account of the Palestine pavi lion 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
25 
 
of the New York Worlds Fair. There ha
d been a New York World's Fair in 
1930...what...8, 9, some t hing like that, and they ne ver closed the bank account of the...of 

the Jewish pavilion or the Palestine Pa vili
on it was called. And that money was funneled 
through the Palestine Pavilion ba nk account, an
d we never got caught. Later, there was 
trouble with arme d shipme nts to the Hagana
h, but that was much later, after the 
Foundation was dated as a ma tter of fact. 
This group that me t on Tuesdays was a 
rema rkable bunch, and the fact that we raised
 several million dollars for the purchase of 
ships is ama z ing because we were a small group and you couldn't talk about it. You 

couldn't do the usual kinds of fund raising 
hoopla. We  me t in peopl
e's rumpus rooms, 
they were called in those days. They 
are called family rooms today, I think. 
And...uh...everybody had to know everybody, and they
 couldn't talk about it, and they 
had to get lots of money. It was a wild opera
tion. I did not enjoy it. One of my tasks, for 
example, was to go once a week for lunch to 
the 21 Club in New York because one of the 
Krinlers was interested in us, and he introdu
ced me  to all these degenerate people. He 
used to hang out at the 21 Club and I'd ge
t mone y from the m. U
h...Some of the ladies 
were very frank about where they money came from and how it came. And I had a 

conscious problem about this, but it didn'
t last because buying the ships was more 
important than my Jewis h conscious. But 
it was a tough time for my fa mi l y and me . We 
were relieved when finally, finally, finally
 the paperwork was done, and we could get 
back to Europe, we thought. I flew to Paris a
nd went in back in to Germany imme diately. 
Got us a house in Heidelberg, and then went
 to Pa ris to pick Esy up when she and 
Michael arrived. They got stuck in Pa ris fo
r 4 week because the paperwork wasn't  in 

order. She lived in a very fancy hotel in Paris for 4 weeks, and then we moved into 

Heidelberg and the next phase 
of this operation begins. Þ HÞ
  
 
 

Q: The tape is... 
 
A: Good place to break. 

 

Q: Yes. It's a good place to break.  

 

Q: Tell me  about Manford. 

 

A: Uh...We  we nt out to dinner at  one day la
st week, and he was aler
t and he was alive and 
he was fine. 
 

Q: Okay. We  may begin. We'r e back on tape. U
h... Let us go back to Germany for a mi nute. 
Uh...There were two people you want
ed to tell us more about. 
 

A: One day in early Fall (clearing throat) 1945 
I walked into our building in Regensburg and 
I went upstairs and I heard very loud sounds, 
kids stomping and shouting, and so I went 
to see what it was. There about 20 teenagers wi
th this short, very short, heavy set, young, 
young ma n leading them in a dance...in a song. 
Uh.  was the theme and  stuff and he had 
those kids going absolutely ma d. And I watc
hed this guy and said to myself, "He's a 
leader. That man is a leader." So I met hi
m. His name was Leon Retter from , a genius 

who had been sent by the Russians to the language school in Moscow when he was 16. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
26 
 
He spoke then and still speaks some where 
between 10 and 15 languages quite fluent ly. 
He was a captain in the Red Army during the wa
r, and at the end of the war decided that 
he wanted to get out. This was what he wanted 
that he wanted to live in Palestine. So he 
ran away, and came into American zone in Germany. Landed in Regensburg. some  
months later his girlfriend joined him and th
ey married. They are still ma rried and they 
lived in Munich for reasons which will become  clear. Uh...We had organized not only the 

central committee, but regional committees. More
 people involved the better. He became  
a me mber of our regional committee, and th
en I...uh...let Klausner know, as a ma tter of 
fact, that I thought this g
uy was...uh...good ma terial and Klausner me t him,  moved him 
down to Munich and Irea which is the na
me  he took instead of Leon,...uh...for reasons 
that have to do with language. Leon means 
lion and Irea me ans lion. Their translation. 
And Redder became  just because he want
ed it to. He...uh...became the foreign secretary 

of the displaced persons. It was he who dealt 
with the big people who came  in. It was he 
who went to Frankfort headquarters to, as he
 said, ma ke dema nds on be half...on behalf of 
the Jewish displaced persons. Tough mi nded,...uh...br
illiant orator who in the spring of 
1946 was sent to the United States for his 
first UJA mi ssions. And he has done UJA off 
and on ever since until hi s retirement a
bout 2 years ago. He's  68 now. He...uh.. should 
have become a ma jor political figure, 
but...uh...Mr. Ben-Gurion was rather capricious 
about his boys, as he called them, and when
 there was a revolt against Ben-Gurion within 
the Labor Party, in the 50's , 
Irea joined the revolt. And 
the old ma n punished him and 
then made him do projects for him afterwards
. Irea decided that th
e way to get along in 
Israel was to be independent, and so he b
ecome Israel's first management consultant on 
huma n relations. As new immi grant groups came 
in, there were all kinds of tensions and 
problems and he would work with those. He's 
a remarkable fellows, still one of my very 
closest friends. He had the right kind of 
hutspah in huge amounts. Uh...It was fun to 
watch him telling General Clay what Genera
l Clay had to do. (Laughter) It was really 
great. He's also...was great with the Jews. I 
went with him one night
 to one of the DP 
camps wher e we had just gotten a telephone call that there was a riot going on. The 

G...the Ame r ican Army did some not very br
ight things. As we became friendl y with the 

Germans, which we did by 1946, 47...Secretary 
Burns had led the way on that...they 
began to put German pol ice in Jewish DP 
ca mps, and the Jews didn't like it much. And 
we had that kind of situation, 
and the Jews went berserk. So 
Irea and I went. He got up on 
the back of the truck and he hushed those Jews
, and then he spoke to them with his kind 
of beery voice, and they went back to thei
r room...home to behave themselves. I have 

never seen one person stop a riot before, 
but he did. He had that kind of power. 
Extremely, extremely charisma tic, powerful guy, who became my brother. And...uh...has 

remained very much a brother. (Sigh) I am 
trying to think of.... We ll, we had a Congress 
of Displaced Persons...uh...in the first year, 
and unquestionably, the most influential 

individual there, besides Klau
sner, wa s Nesher. Okay, that's Nesher. That's who he is. 
That's  who he was. Uh...He went to Palestin
e in time for the War of Independence cause 
he insist ed on doing so. He and Lilly took a 
bunch of kids on a legal trip because there 

were some ... And both of them went into the 
Army, and I tease them to this day about the 

fact that she outranked him. He
 was a  sergeant and she was a lieutenant. Lilly, his wife, is 
one of the experts on Soviet Jewry. She was 
taking Jews out of the Soviet Union when 
nobody was taking Jews out of the Soviet Un ion. And...uh...still there was a great deal 

about Soviet Jewry. Okay, so much for Nesh
er Kl ausner. When I saw Klausner at the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
27 
 
Chaplains' meeting, first time I had seen hi
m since Dachau, and we ma de all the plans 
and started the package system. Uh...It was cl
ear that any Chaplain who wanted to do the 
job right should do so in consultation with Ab
e. The leaders of the DPs were his. He wa s 
the President. The processes of the central 
committee he was in the mi ddle of. He tried 
not to deal with the U.S. Ar my because he was absent without leave. He spent total of 8 
months absent without leave. 
He had no assignment. He didn't get paid. He also did not 
do anything for the Army. He was unconnected
 to the American Army. He me t every 
once in awhile with some  general, but he 
was unconnected with the American Army a nd 
nobody realized it. Uh...I knew it, but what the 
heck?  It wasn't my business. One day I 
had to go to 3rd Army Headquarters in . That
 was the day I saw all of General Patton's 
cars and jeeps and  his priv
ate...uh...fleet. I went up to th
e Chaplain's  office to get 
whatever I went to get. I don't reme mber wh
at. And I heard a voice 
call, "Chaplain." So 
everybody in the room turned around because there must have been 15 chaplains in the 

room, and this guy from inside the private 
office was pointing his finger at me . And I  
said, "Yes, Sir." And I went in. A bird Col
onel...uh...O'Reilley, he's  
Senior Chaplain of 
the 3rd Army, regular Army Cat
holic, and he said, "What 's your name , Chaplain?" I told 
him my na me. And he said, "Tell me  Lipm
an, do you happen to know a Chaplain named 
Klausner?" I thought, "Oh, boy!" I said, "Which
 one, Sir? " And he crossed hims elf and 
said, "Holy Mary, Mother of God. Don't tell me
 there are two of them." And I said, "Yes, 
Sir. There's Chaplain Berkland Klausner. There's Chaplain Abraham Klausner." What I 

knew that he didn't know was that Berk Klausn
er was in England, but that didn't ma tter. I 

was telling the truth. He said, "You know, I ha
ve been hearing rumors about a Chaplain 
Klausner in my area, but I don't get monthl
y reports from him. Do you e ver see him. " 
And I said, "I suppose I could find him if I 
tried hard." He said, "Would you do me  a 
favor?" "Of course, Sir." "Would you please te
ll him that I am looking for him because I 
must have his monthly reports?" I said, "I wi
ll certainly tell him." Next day, I had lunch 
with Abe in Munich and I said to him, 
"Here's your me ssage from Chaplain O'Reilly." 

And he listened, and he said, "Okay, me ssage 
has been received." I 
said, "No. Let's do it. 
Let's regularize you. It will be  good for you, and it would enha nce your status. It wouldn't 

destroy your status with the Army." We sat 
down in his house on  with the help of the 
JDC wome n sitting at the typewriters a
nd we wrote 8 monthly reports. (Laughter) 
Numbers, statistics, services
 conducted, counseling sessions
 held, the works! And he 
signed them, and we sent them in through 
channels with no note of any kind. We  
arranged for one of the officers to see that th
ey got into the mail syst em and they landed 
in the Chaplain's office. Next thing Abe 
heard was he got orders brought to him by a 
finance officer who was bringi
ng him 8 months pay. He hadn't been paid for 8 months. 
He got this stack of occupation currency, a
nd the finance officer 
said, "While I was 
comi ng here, the Adjutant General asked if I 
would bring you these. They are orders." 
And Abe looked and in the orders he was assi
gned to a hospital in Munich. And that's  
where he rema ined. He just kept right on 
going. Never move d into 
the hospital. Reported 
to the hospital. Spoke to the hospital Chapla
in and said, "If you have
 any Jews problems, 
call me ." (Laughter) And disappeared and 
never heard from a gain. That's how he 
operated. Abe opened DP camps. He started 
two hospitals. When they emptied out 
Dachau, he took care of those people. There 
was a fa mous transport of twelve hundred 
Hungarians who were supposed to go back to
 Hungary. The U.S. Ar my had a policy. It 
had two parts. First, one was everybody goe
s home. No ma tter what. It's our job to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
28 
 
repatriate. It isn't our job to move pe opl
e around and second of a
ll, there are no Jews. 
They are Poles. They are Hungarians. They 
are Ruma nians. They are Germans. They are 
Austrians. There aren't  any Jews. And at first, there were mi xed DP ca mp s. And the 
Ar my couldn't understand why there were ri
ots every night. Peopl
e getting hurt every 
night. Some  of us wrote lette
rs through channels to the 
Commanding General, a fellow 
name d Eisenhower, saying, "Can't  do this. The Jews are in unique position, and you 

really must some how, Sir, ... uh...organize specia
l camps for them." It wasn't  until July 
that or ders came out (a) declar ing Jews a na
tionality and (b) permitting separate facilities. 
So we started...we...UNRRA blew it. They
 started Jewish DP camps. UNRRA was 
unable to do so. We ll, Abe did it. He had this 
crazy capacity to do all 
sorts of things with 
very few resources. Another funny story that ha
ppened to Abe, but it's  not about him. 
Obviously, the Jews wanted to 
leave. One day, he was in his office, still at the Dorchus 
Museum, be fore he moved into–There was a 
knock on the door, and 
this little Jew came 
bursting in and, "Herr Chaplain. Herr Chap
lain." "Yes." This was...conversation was 
carried on in Yiddish although an instanta
neous translation. U
h..."I have a visa." 
"Wonderful," said Abe. And they danced toge
ther and they pranced together, "You have 
a visa. Where are you going? " "Costa Rica." "Marvelous, it's a beautiful country," and 

they kibitzed around for a good...and the guy was a
bout to leave and he turned to Abe and 
said, "Herr Chaplain, May I ask a question?" "O
f course." "Where's  
Cos t a Rica?" He had 
no idea what part of the world Costa Rica wasin, and I suspect he didn't go there either. 

He ma y have started for there, but he didn't 
land there. What else should I tell you about 
Klausner?  Uh...The Ar my arranged for him to come  home in 1946 too. He will gi ve you 

all kinds of stories about how...how and why 
it happened, but it happened. As soon as he 
got to the United States, he began to ma neuver to
 get back because that's all he wanted to 
do. He was a bachelor, and this was his lif
e. And General Hilldring was Assistant 
Secretary of State for International Affairs. Good guy! And Abe went to him, and 
Hilldri ng arra nged for him to go back to Germany and he did go back. Did some  
interesting things that had to do with the e
xodus people as a matter of fact and when I get 
to exodus we'll talk about that. And th
en, eventually, I came home  and...uh...took up a 
Rabbinical career. He's  been in Yonkers, Ne
w York, for ma ny, ma ny years. He's  just 
retiring. 
 

Q: Okay. We 'll pick up with him later. Befo
re we leave Regensburg, was it in Regensburg 
that you had occasion to call upon a Nazi doctor. 
 

A: No. It was not in Rege
nsburg, and it was later. 

  

Q: Okay. 

 

A: It's from Hei delberg to another town. 

 

Q: Then let's pick up as it were chronolog
ically again. We  jump back. You have been 
civiliani zed and return
ed to Heidelberg.  
 

A: Went to Heidelburg to live. And I did (sigh)
 three jobs. I was res
ponsible for all routine 
liaison with the American Army. there 
was a Brigadier General in Frankfort 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
29 
 
Headquarters, a good ma n, solid ma n, with whom 
I had the right to talk anytime I wanted 
to, or he would call me  whenever he had so
me thing, and we talked a great deal. Second, 
any publicity or public relations that had 
to do with the underground, I was responsible 
for and...uh...I'll come  ba ck to that in a mi nute. 
My third one was to l
ead transports with a 
guy who wa s then called Wolf, whos e name  was 
not and is not Wolf. Uh...His name  is 
Efrian Franke. Uh...He lives in . He's an atto
rney, Israel's most di
stinguished restitution 
attorney. Married to a woma n na me d Hanna, w
ho was one of the me mbers of this group 
in Germany, and they have an infinite num
ber of grandchildren by 
now. It was the second 
ma rriage for both of them. So, Efrian who wa
s never called Efrian 
and I did transports 
together, as the leaders of them. I was calle
d to Paris one day because a major American 
newspaper person wanted an interview with 
the famous Colonel Wolf, and I arranged it. 
Efrian was in Paris, and we ma de this inte
rview by agreeing to meet at a certain place. 
We me t at that place, got into a cab and went
 to another place. Got into a cab, and went to 
a third place. I guess it was a
bout the 4th place where Efrian
 finally walked in, and the 
reporter joined us. Because everybody assume d 
a ll the time that the British were looking 
for us. That was one of my P.R. jobs. The mo
st important P.R. job I guess I ever did had 
to do with the late M . We had a contact 
in the United States where reporters were 
concerned. Let me  tell you about one of the in
cidents and then I will
 come  to . Uh...The 
door bell rang one day in Heidelberg, and a young, fresh faced guy said, "My name  is 

Dick Dudman, and I want a story about the 
Haganah." And I said, 
"Never heard of it," 
and I closed the door. And I sent
 a wire to the late I.F. St one in New York. Isy Stone was 
our New York contact. He 
was working for P.M. newspaper then, and nobody could get 
into Haganah for a story unless Stone sent hi
m. And I in this cable said, "What's this 
Dudman guy?  Do I let him in or not?  He clai
ms to be from t he Denver Post." And I got a 
wire back saying, "Yal, He's okay." So I ma nage d to get word...uh...I don't re me mber 

how I did it or whether Isy did it, but Dudman
 came to my door again. And we made him 
into a displaced person. Gave him everything 
he needed to be a displaced person, and 
sent him on one of the trips. And he wrote ame morable series of articles for the Denver 

Post on being a displaced person, and what 
it was like to go on one
 of these illegal 
trips...uh...for  which he got a name  and fellowship by the way. Later, we became friends 

again here in Wa shington, because he  was 
the head of the Washington Bureau, the St. 
Louis Post Dispatch, and...uh...now lives in Ells
worth, Maine. He and his wife decided 
that it was a small town for them. They bought
 a radio station in Ellsworth. Dick also 
became fa mous because...uh...reme mber when we were not in Ca mbodia, he was 

captured...uh...with the American troops in Cam
bodia...with his press credentials, and he 
was mi ssing for several weeks and we all went
 out of our minds till he came  back quite 
unharmed. Re ma rkable reporter, and those 
stories I think...uh...were very exciting and 
very important in having Americans unde
rstand what this crazy underground was all 

about. But...uh...I guess the longest lasting piece of P.R. has to do with a movie, which 

was ma de by Myrlon in..starring his wife,, 
who is now his widow. She was a writer. 
Uh...He ca me with full credentials, of cour
se, and moved into our house in Heidelberg. 
He was going to ma ke a movie of one of our 
transports because the 
story of this movi e 
was this displaced person and how this disp
laced person got to Palestine. And obviously 
this displaced person had to be out of Germa
ny. And we decided to use one of our regular 
transports. So one night, we applied all transp
orts out of our part 
of Germa n...the ones I 
was responsible for left on Saturday night. 
Why, I hear you ask, Saturday night?  Because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
30 
 
as few Amer ican troops as possible were on 
duty Saturday night. Saturday night is 
getting drunk night or having 
a beer night or reading a 
good book night, but you're not on 
duty Saturday night if you can avoid it, so
 it was easiest to get through the border on 
Saturday nights. We  always had some kind of papers. We  never tried just to sneak 
through a border. That was too risky. Uh...The
re were times when for s mall groups we 
would go through borders, but we had a list of th
e constabulary units 
and their schedules, 
where they would be when General Mickelson 
always saw that we 
had those. That was 
the guy at Frankfort Headquarters who was 
my contact, a Brigadier name d Abraham 

Mickelson. And he provided t
hose. Uh...But the big trans
ports, we had to go through 
roads and border point s because we were in 6 by 6 trucks, and some  Ger man trucks, 

though we never used wood burning ones. We  bought trucks. We bought gasoline. If did 

not have Army supplies unless we could 
steal them, and you couldn't steal large 

quantities of gasoline. That's hard to do. But by this time we had a budget and we were 

getting money from the United States. This
 was a transport of about twelve hundred 
people, leaving Saturday night from the to
wn of Noowhom. We owned a barracks in 
Noowhom. We bought it. It was ours. And we c
ould use it to get people ready to go. And 
we would appear there on either Friday or some time early Saturday, and the people 

would arrive. How they were selected and how 
they got there is a story unto itself, but 
that's  what we eventually had 130 Palestinia
ns doing out around the countryside. They 
had political problems; they had age problems;
 they had all kinds of problems in ma ki ng 
up these transports. How did we know how ma
ny to send?  Uh...Let me  a sk myself the 
question when I finish the Myrlon Lynn story be
cause it's  a separate story which has its 
own kind of interest. We  got 
instructions on my t e lephone. Saturday night we would have 
our people all ready. This was a well organi
zed thing. We  kne w who was going to be in 
which trucks. If they were pregnant wome n, th
ey were in the same  truck, and there was a 

nurse with them. Some times the nurse was 
a woma n na me d Esther Lipman, who was not 
a nurse. But she was pregnant at the time, so
 she knew all about it. (Laughing) We  were 
going to have  our second child, so Esther a few pieces of equipment and she went on 

some of these transpor ts as transport nurse
. We  never delivered a baby on one of these 

transports, I'm glad to say. It's just as well.
 The tough part of the trip was the night part 
into the Black Forest. And so we left. Every 
2 hours we would stop for relief. We  left at 
mi dnight so that we had two or three 2-hour 
periods before dawn. At dawn or shortly 

thereafter, we  would arrive at what wa s known as the picnic area. We  had been looking 

for this for weeks, and when we found it, 
it was as though we had found Heaven. There 
was a place in the mi ddle of the Black Forest 
where a small road went off to the right. 
And they went about a half a mile and then 
there was a circle, at the end of which there 
was a wine house. End of road. That's perfect. 
No traffic. On the side of the road was a 
little cabin. And there we got one of the great 
breaks of the entire era. When a DP name d 
Gittshuck, who worked for us, and I were looki
ng for this place...and...for a place, and we 
came to this, we decided we better check out
 that cabin. We  knocked on the cabin door, 

and a lady answered wearing Bavarian costum
es as everybody in the Black Forest did. 
They wore old fashioned Bavarian costumes. 
And we talked to her and asked her if she 
would have any objections if every once in
 awhile, every week, 10 days, some  people 
would come  and rest on the side of the hill and use the st ream at the bottom of the hill 

just to wash. And she said, "I have no object
ion, but who are they? "  
And I said, "They're 
concentration camp survivors who are going 
to their new homes, and we are moving 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
31 
 
them." And she said, "Oh, can I 
help?" And I said, "If you want to feed them, it would be 
a great help. We  often have children. It would 
be ma rvelous if we could leave cereal with 
you and we could have hot gruel for these kids
 when they get here and hot tea for the 
adults. That would be absolutely ma rvel
ous." Nothing to that. Asked some  more 
questions, as I was interested. This wo ma n wa
s a Jew, who had ma rried when she was at 
the University a nonªJewish German. When 
the Nazi...when the war started, he was 
pulled into the Army. She decided and he deci
ded and his father decided that she should 
hide out in this cabin with the father becau
se he lived there in the mi ddle of the woods. 
How ma ny people would come  into the Bl
ack Forest looking for some body?  Uh...She 
was announced as his daughter-in-law, and 
her husband was off in the Army being a 
hero. Her husband was killed on the eastern 
front, so she stayed. Took care of the old 
ma n. She took care of the old ma n till he died about 1946, and because some  of the 
neighbors knew that she was Jewish and nobody ha
d turned her in, she decided to live out 
her life there. She had a job. She worked. She had her husband's  pension from the Ar my, 

whatever it was, and she was livi
ng there. So then we were able
 to tell her that  these were 
Jews. And this became our picnic area. Every transport going to Milhouse in France...uh 

...went through there, and this woma n loved it
. She was ma gnificent. I reme mber her with 
great affection. Any how, afte
r resting at the picnic gr
ound and having a me al, we got 
back into the trucks and headed for a pl
ace called Pompdecess, where the only bridge 

across the Rhine was. It was a military br
idge. And...uh..we got to Pomp decess, and we 

had to be there at 4 o'clock. Not 5, not 3 because the French officer whom we owned, the 

, immi gration officer, was sure to be on 
duty then. Any day but Sunday. And he would 
take our papers and pass them right thr
ough. So we got through the Duon easily. And 
then fr om there to Milhouse in France was not
hing to it, and there there wa s a big railroad 
yard and the French Haganah picked up the 
people at Mulhous and took them by train to 
some where in the Marseilles area de pe nding on wh
ere the ship was going to be sit, Port 
Boog or Marseilles itself, whatever. This par
ticular transport had Tereska on board as a 
DP. She had DP papers. She had DP clothing. Sh
e was a DP. In front of this particular 
transpor t just  before  my car  was the camer
a car with Myra. And we had a terrible time 
with Myer. It wasn't  his fault. He had to ma
ke noise. He had to call some thing out to the 
camera crew. You can't  do it. He had to call 
this...There's simp ly no way to do it. You're 

going to shut up or you ain't going.  You see you had to go through the American zone of 

occupation to the French zone of occupation. Pompdecess was in the French zone. The 

French zone was a small zone in the sout
hwestern Germany. The French insisted on 
having a zone. It was a four-power power th
ing after all. So going from the American 
zone to the French zone was the danger
ous one. And having the camera crew along was 
great, because we say the United Nations wanted 
to have records of all these transports of 
survivors as they go to their new homes a
nd...uh..we have a crew with us, and want to 
take your picture at the borde
r as you do your duty, and we got through very fast. Uh...It 
was very difficult for Myer. I am sure he suffere
d a lot.  It's got the illegals. It  is st ill 
available in 16 millimeter. It st ill gets re
nted I understand by sc hool groups and others 
who want to see it. One mi nor tragedy in it which we laugh about in our fa mily, but it 

isn't totally funny. Esther was along on that 
transport as transport nurse. The only time  
that I appear in the film was at Pomp d
ecess where I am standing with the Duan going 
over the papers and getting people ready to 
go through. And Esther was filmed there too. 
There were other pictures of 
me  in the...in my car and so forth. We  had a car with a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
32 
 
moveable roof so that we could stan
d on the seat and watch what was going on. 
Dangerous, but...uh...very effective because we 
ha d to see what was going on. We  didn't 
want to lose any trucks. They
 had to stay in line. Uh...We
 had to go through one or two 
towns, went through Fribrook for example and in
 the streets of Fribrook, we  did not want 
to lose trucks. But the only one that got prin
ted and is in the film is me  at the...there's  
nothing of Esy. All the shots of Esther got
 cut in the editing, and she never stopped 
teasing Myer about it. And whenever we me
t, he would come up and want to hug her 
hello and she would say, "Y
ou don't want to hug me . You wo
uldn't even put me  in your 
movie." (Laughter) So...uh...that's our...Myer  
saga of The Illegal. Incidentally, 
they...uh...filme d the...the boat. That part of th
e trip being caught 
by the Br itish, going to 
Cyprus. They got a complete record on the illega
l. I forget how much of it is in the fi lm. 
But that was part of the P.R. job as well as 
taking transports. Uh...With one exception we 
had no difficulty, with the transports to Fr
ance. Uh...One night they got nasty at the 
border and kept us there 5 hours, and it wa
s only when we finall
y, finally found Paul 
Edwards... It being a Saturday night, he wa
sn't  at home  either. When he finally got 
home ...uh...just before dawn, that he was able to
 say to these guys, "Are their papers in 

order?  Is my  signature on them?  Wh at do you 
want?  Get them out of there?  You've had 
those peoples in there a long tim
e. They'r e tired. They have to get where they'r e going." 
So the soldiers backed down. And...uh..that 
had been the result of a tip from a CID 
Criminal Investigation Division of the Arm
y, I a m sorry to say, a young ma n I knew. The 
son of some body I had grown up with in Pitt
sburgh who was stuck on 
his duty and he got 
a...in his investigations or 
whatever, he heard that a bunc
h of Jews were going out on 
Saturday night and he notified the bo
rder station. But it happened. Not everybody 
was...uh...all for what we were doing. Ther
e were people aside from the British who 
didn't think we were...uh...behaving properly. Oka
y, that's transports. Oh, no, there's one 
more thing about it that I mu
st me ntion. How did we get th
e quotas and the number of 
people who were going to take a transport?  
I had a telephone. Because I was a Lieutenant 
Colonel, I had a telephone that could ca
ll outside the country. Whenever we were 

scheduled for a transport, at 
precisely 7 o'clock in the ev
ening, my phone would ring. It 
would be a fema le voice talking English with
 a heavy French accent who never identified 
herself and who gave me a li
st of agricultural implements
 and tools and God knows what 
all, that I was to copy down with numbers. A
nd the code Hiamhead I didn't  know what it 
said. I imme diatel y called Munich and transmitted it to Munich, and that 's how we knew 

about our transports. Some  years later, 48 
or 9, I don't re me mber, I was asked by the UJA 
to go to the opening of the campaign in Nas
hville, Tennessee, at a posh country club and 
I went. Sitting next to me  at
 dinner was a woma n name d Pa ul
ette Oppert O P P E R T, a 
French Jew, whose husband had been killed in
 the resistance who had herself been in the 

resist ance and who after the war worked for 
the French Haganah and for people in Pa ris. 
She later ma rried an Americ
an businessman na med Fink, and lived in Minneapolis for 
ma ny, many years. I saw her once in awhile. I 
listened, and I said to her, "Paulette. I 
know your voice." And she said, "I have been 
sitting here going crazy cause I know your 
voice." It was she. She had been calling from 
Paris all those months, giving me all those 
instructions out of order wh
ich she understood, not a word
 of which I understood, that 
ma de it possible for the transports to go. 
We  felt like blood brother and sister. Okay, 
that's the...uh...that's the transport business. What's next? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
33 
 
Q: Okay. Alright. Uh...How did 
you start preparing for the Exodus? 
 
A: Well, first of all we got a call from Paulet
te, telling us that we had to 52 hundred people 
in Marseilles on a certain date. The largest tr
ansport that had ever
 been contemplated. 
And the people in the camps did their job. And 
it was decided that two of the transports 
would go by train, by way of Strasbourg, and th
ree of them would go by truck and they 

would be back to back and then we would go down, turn around and come  back, load up, 

and do this three time s. Two of the m being 
Saturday nights, and one of them being mi d-
week which we had never done before. But what'r e we going to do. Because we had to 

get these people on board. The British were wa
tching this ship in sit where it was, and 
they didn't have a heck of a lot of time, so 
we rushed it. All of these people had to get 
new identities because  we using a se ries of Fr
ench transit vi sas that the Minist er of the 
Interior people had kindly prepared for us
, but they were...we would call in blank. They 
weren't really blank at all. They had name
s on them. They just weren't name s of any 
living people, and they all had ages and they
 all had birth places. So we prepared in 
advance DP cards. Uh...All DPs had identity
 cards issued by UNRRA wi th military 
authorization and we had tens of thousa
nds of them that we had printed and...uh...we 
issued new ones to all of these people with
 the proper stamps on them and then we 
handed them out at Nooam in the barracks in 
the stables ther e, and told them, "You got a 
new na me . You got to know how old you are. You got to know where you were born. It 

has nothing to do with you. It 
has to do with whatever that
 name  is on that piece of 
piece." So they all had to learn them. And so
me  of the old people had difficulties with 
this. Kids had no trouble at all. There wa
s one cute little kid with obviously orthodox 
origins was standing there holding these thi
ngs and chuckling back and forth as he 
me morized his name  and his birthplace and his 
birth da te. It was nice. And then we took 
them. Nor mally, when we got Milhouse there 
was a little hotel th
ere. A wonderful lady 
owned it who fed us a hot meal. This is the staff who had gone on the trip. The people 

were on the train bound for Marseilles alr
eady...and...uh...we'd spend the night and part 
of the next day. Relax a little bit, have so
me  fun, drink some  good wi
ne. I learned to eat 
pâté for the first time  and...Milhouse is in...uh...S
S Lorraine...that part of France and they 
ma de wonderful pâté. So this time  we got th
ere early evening. We  turned in. Didn't have 
all that wonderful hospitality. And in the mi ddl
e of the night, we got 
back in our trucks 
and we went back to , and that night we load
ed up and we did that three time s in 8 days. 
Esy was not with me  on the Exodus ones. I don't reme mber why not, but she wasn't . 

And...uh...when I left I said to her as I always di
d, "I'll be back when I get here," and all 
she would say to people who called was, "I 
am sorry. He's  out of town. Have you tried 
the Munich office? " Uh...This was the longest
 I had been away. And she allowed as how 
she was a little bit apprehensive, but nothing 
we could do about it. That's  how the people 
got on the exodus. The French Haganah did a s
uperlative job in get
ting all those trains. 
Uh...That's a  lot of bribery for the railway o
fficials to... These were 
private trains. These 
weren't just seats on train. Twelve
 hundred people is a lot of...l
ot of people. So these were 
three transports of between a thousa
nd and twelve hundred each, and the other 
approxima tely two thousand went by train from
 Germany. Then the exodus story doesn't  
end there. It goes on because as people should 
know, the British sent that ship back. Not 
the ship. The ship stayed in Haifa Harbor. It's  st
ill there. By the way, it's falling apart. It is 
disintegrating and will not last  forever. They've tried to preser ve it. It's not working very

well. It's been in a museum for quite awhile. 
They sent the people back
 in three ships to a 
place called Port Luke, where they went on 
a hunger strike. They wouldn't get off. The 
British took them off by force, and then put 
them back on again and shipped them around 
to Hamburger in the British zone where they 
were taken, by I think, tr
uck or train to two 
concentration camps. One is called Amisto
w and one is called Popendorf where they 
incarcerated them. One of the things Abe Klau
sner did was organize their escape with a 
bunch of the Haganah people, and they es
caped. And one of my great stories was 
greeting some  of the m again 
at Nooam when they went a second time. I don't know how 
ma ny of them went the second time by Haganah, but I had all transport of them one 
night, twelve hundred of them who went. 
They landed on Cyprus. Cyprus requires 
specific me ntion. We  ma de jokes about Cyprus. 
We are going to have a Jewish State, but 
it's not going to be an ordinary state. It's
 already an empire. It
 has a colony. Cyprus. 
Because we had tens of thousands of Je
ws interned on Cyprus by the British in 
concentration camps. The first immi grants whocame  into Israel after independence were 

the people from Cyprus. They had priorities
. God knows they had earned them, and they 
came through. That was Cyprus. I have never been to Cyprus. I should go there some  

day. What's next Linda? 
 

Q: Okay. Where did you...What did you do after 
the exodus transport or do you want to go 
back? 
 

A: Uh...I think we ought to do th
e baby before we forget it. 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: A good friend of mi ne, displaced pe rson, had 
a child. Called me from where they were, 
told me  that they were in te
rrible trouble. The child was born with infantile jaundice, and 
she was getting dehydrated and they weren't 
sure she could live. 
It was particularly 
painful because they were displaced persons 
and looked forward to this child, even more 
particularly painful for this father wa s a 
physician and didn't know how to save his child. 
So Esther and I got into our 
truck...our car...it was truck, and we
 went to that town to be 
with them. When I got there the father told 
me  in the most agonized tones I have ever 
heard that he had a decision to ma ke and didn't know how to ma ke it. That 30 or 40 miles 

down the road, not in the country, wa
s a very famous Ger man...uh...obstetrician, 
pediatrician, who was barred from practicing 
medicine because he had not only been a 
Nazi, but he had done experime nts on Jewish ch
ildren. But, said the father, this ma n can 
save my daughter if anybody can. He has uni
que infor mation and me thods that nobody in 
this hospital knows about. I sai
d, "I don't think I am asking 
you. I think I am going to tell 
you. Your daughter's life is more important than 
the fact that this ma
n was a Nazi. If he 
can save your daughter's life, that's saving 
the world for you. You gotta do it." So he 
decided we better do that. So I went down in 
my jeep and me t this doctor who was living 
in a little cabin in the woods. A very di
gnified, mi ddle-aged ma n who spoke relatively 

good English. I told him the circumstances and 
said we would pay him well to come and 
take care of this child. And he said, "Alright
." And he got into thejeep with his bag and 
he came. And he spent about 48 hours without
 sleep taking care of this baby. And he 
saved her. After it was all over, I drove hi
m back to his cabin and gave him Ger man 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
35 
 
money, a large sum and I said, "I trust that's enough for your services." He  said, "I don't 
care about the money." He said, "I want
 a letter from you addressed to military 
governme nt saying that you recomme nd that 
I be permitted to practice again because I 
saved this Jewish child." Now I said, in e
ffect, "Doctor, you should live so long." And I 
left the money, and I left with him not being 
very happy with me . The end of this story is 
not a pleasant one. The child developed acute
 leukemi a at the age of 4 and died. The 
fa mily had other children, but that was a ba
d blow. That was in the United States. Okay. 
You know who to talk to if you want more about
 that one, and if that
 person says to you, 
"Cut it completely," I insist 
you have to do so. She has a perf
ect right to her privacy and 
if this is too much to identification it's  got
 to go. Next, after the exodus we went into a 
bad time. Uh...First of all, 
all the stuff was going on at th
e United Nations. Would there 
be a Jewish State, whether 
or not there would be a Jewi
sh State, where they'd be 
partitione d, wouldn't there be partition and wh
at should we be doing meanwhile. So I sat 
in my office day after day in Heidelberg 
doing not very much. Uh...Taught English to a 
couple of medical students at Heildelberg Un
iversity. Uh...This, I think, is worthwhile 
story. Uh...The University gave 15 fellowship 
to Jewish survivors to study me dicine. Full 
tuition and books. Three of them I still have
 communication with. One of them was my 
secretary's husband, and...uh...he practices as an
 internist in New York, and we are good 
friends. I taught him English. She was my s
ecretary because she spoke Hebrew, German, 
Yiddish, Hungarian, Russian, and was a rema rkable woma n. She still is. Her husband is a 

good doctor. Two of the m are my st ory rea
lly. It...uh...has to be told
 backwards. About 
two years ago, here in Wa shington, my wife 
attended a semi nar at the Washington School 
of Psychiatry, being conducted by two very immi
nent psychiatrists from the University of 
Cincinnati Medical School, na
me d Ornstein. Anna and Paul Ornstein. They had the full 
day and Esther went up at the end to thank 
them, and Anna said to her, "Tell me  your 
name  again. I want to reme mber you." She told her her name . Paul, who was standing 
about 10 feet away, came over and said, "What did you say your name  was? " She told 
him. He said, "Are you by any chance re
lated to...to Chaplain Lipman." Anybody who 
calls me  Chaplan Lipman goes back to Germa
ny. She said, "Yes, I am married to him." 
At which point, he bursts into tears, thre
w his arms around her and wouldn't let her go. 
He and Anna had been two of those me dical 
students in Heidelber
g. Very poor. They had 
a room in a German house. The Germans w
ould do nothing for them. They lived, aside 
from going to me dical school which they want
ed to do, for Friday night for whenever I 
was in town we had a Shabbat service, a
nd if anybody else could conduct one when I 
wasn't  there, they had a Shabbat service, fo
llowe d by a Shabbat dinner for all the Jews in 

the area. Displaced persons, G.I.s, the Pale
stinians who mi ght be passing through because 
our house was a way station for any illega
l going through. We  had 4 bedrooms on the 
third floor with 12 army cots and we ha
d as ma ny as 14 people on a given night. 
Uh...And then of course the arms and the czar.
 They came and went without us. They had 
a key to the cellar and they 
moved out. After the service 
and dinner, we sit around and 
talked. And it was the only a
dult conversation these people had and they thought of the 
Chaplain as some body very special. The next
 night after this revelation, Pa ul gave a 
lecture in Wa shington and I went and then we
 went out afterwards to drink coffee and 
begin to catch and he looked at me  and he
 smiled and he said, "You know. It's eerie." I 
said, "Why?" He said, "You are only 4 years ol
der than I am." I said, "Oh, you're thinking 
of that Chaplain." He said, "That's right. I 
have never quite gotten rid of that image." I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
36 
 
said, "Please get rid of it (la
ughter) real fast." And we ha
ve seen a great deal of one 
another since then, and are good friends. The pe
rson who saved their lives in Heildelberg 
was a Protestant mi nister. Herman M a us,...uh... wh
om I call the  of He
ildeberg. I read an 
article about him once. He had been a very
 famo us pastor...uh...before World Wa r II was 
pastor of the Holy Ghost Church of He
idelberg. He had become  a Zionist in 1933 
because when he grew up in Titisay in the Bl
ack Forest, his father, 
a poor pastor, had not 
been able to send him to college . A Jew in
 Titisay came to him and said, "Herma n, you 
want to be a pastor like a fa
ther don't you?" And he said, "Yes. You have to go to school, 
don't you." "Yes. Okay, you go to school and I will 
take care of the b
ills. You just be a 
good pastor." The year he graduated and was 
ordained the Jewish friend said, "Herma n, 
you've done well. Before you take up your 
first congregation, you have a vacation 
comi ng. He handed him some  money and told 
him to take a vacation. And he went to 
Switzerland and he turned up in Bail during the 1903 Zionist 
Convention, the famous one 
at which the Uganda Resolution was turned dow
n, and he me t Hertzl and he me t Nordau 
and he met all of those people, and he jo
ined up. David Yellin became his particular 
friend. He made his first trip to Palestine with his wife and daughter in 1933 this summe r, 
and he said to David Yellin, "I'm not going 
back. There is where I belong and this is 
where I want  to stay." And Yellin sa id to 
him, "Herman, you haven't earned the right to 
stay. You have to go back and to earn it." 
The daughter said, "My father can go back. I 
am not going." And the daughter rema ined in
 Jerusalem, became a weaver, until after 
World Wa r II. When her father got very old, 
she went back to care of them because the 
mother couldn't anymor e. But she lived in 
Palestine the whole time. He came back and 
because he was a pacifist, he went to every 
peace meeting there was anywhere in Europe 
carrying me ssages about how to get Jewish kids 
out, how to save this, how to save that, 
and he did that until 1941 when the Germans picked him up and put him in a 

concentration camp. And he and his wife bot
h spent the war years in a concentration 
camp, and they both survived. He came  back and became Dean of the Diocese, that's 
second to the Bishop and did several things which 
were characteristic of him. First of all, 
every Yom Kippur, he spent all day in the 
synagogue and fasted as penance for the 

Germans. Se cond of all, he announced to his 
congregation, that is to the people he dealt 
with, that for the rest of his life he w
ould never pr each a sermon on a New Testament 
theme. That it was time that Christians went 
back to their origins and learned what they 
should have been. He preached only out of the 
Hebrew bible for the rest of his life, and 
he never mi ssed. I know that. Third of all,
 every Jewish displaced person around he 
would take food to. He visited all of thesestudents at least oncea week bringing them 

food on condition that they tell nobody. My secr
etary never told me that she ever had a 
visit from him. Anna and Paul told me  last 
year about their relati
onship with Maus. Maus 
had been to my home . I had been to his home.
 He took me  to meet Carl Yasburs, and we 
had an incomprehensible conversation one 
day (laughter) and...uh..but he never told me . 
No one told me . They ke pt their promise.
 He looked after these people. I think it's 
absolutely fitting that ther e is a large forest
 in Israel name d for  him, and it pleases me . 
You know this is all part of the Heidelberg saga. 
 

Q: Yes. Let us break at this point. 
We 'r e going to break and change tapes. 
 

A: You know what we ought to do? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
37 
 
 
Q: What? 

 

A: It's a quarter after 2:00. My own suggesti
on would be that we break until you have a 
chance to read this stuff and I have a chance to
 go through the letters.
  I have me ntioned a 
number of times the role that
 luck played in getting result
s and coincide nce. Luck every 
one in awhile reunited a fa mily. I have one pa
rticular me mory of being in my office in 

Regensburg, and a young woma n came in, kind of
 agitated and excited. She had heard a 
rumor. She had no living relatives so far as
 she knew. Everybody had been killed, but she 
heard a rumor that ma ybe her younger brothe
r had survived and was in Germany. And I 
said, "Do you have any idea where?" And she sa
id, "Yal. I think so."I said, "The way to 
find out is to go there. There's no point in
 trying to do it...uh...by a
ny other way." So we 
got in my jeep and we went. We  got to th
is town and found a Jew and asked around and it 
was her brother and he was there. And we real
ly should have tape re
corders in those days. 
Every recording of the looks on their 
faces as they met each other, each 
believing...having been forced to believe that 
the other was dead. Ev
ery once in awhile a 
tragedy occurred however in this connecti
on. I reme mber a case, sad case, which has 
since been written up in the a
nnals of Jews Law. I didn't decide it. A guy came  in to one 

of our communities, lived there, and did not 
know what had become  of his wife . We nt on 
the assumption that she was killed. We took a 
sort of informal position. Jewish law didn't 
permit it, but we took it infor mally that as 
a certain date there would be a presumption 
that anybody who hadn't been heard from wa
s dead. I don't reme mber whether it was 2 
years or what length of time . And 
we...we knew this was an informal, 
not...uh...sanctioned, position in Jewish law, 
but...uh...people had to get on with their 
lives. And a lot of people were just plain mi
ssing. There was no way to find out. And this 
ma n met a woma n, wanted to ma rry her, a
nd...uh...the time  came and they ma rried. And 6 
months later, his first wife  turned up. She ha
d been off in Sovi et Union over in Siberia 
some where and it had taken a long time for her to get out and to come  to Germany. 
Under Jewish law, of course, he had to divor
ce both of them. And as happens so often, 
one does not hear the end of 
the story. I don't know with which one he ended up. I am not 
sure that it ma tters at this point. The dile
mma...that was a very poi
gnant one, and the fact 
that I have only one story out of the 
ma ny hundr eds of people...uh...with whom I ca me 
into contact during those 3 years is, I thi
nk, a ma rked stateme nt of the propriety of 
ma king a decision that just set a date afte
r which you have to gamble. You gamble. For 
most of the people, they had a little mazal
 and the gamble was okay. When they married, 
they could stay married. I don't think it's good 
luck that one's first spouse is dead, but 
there it is 
 

Q: Under what circumstances did you leave Europe? 

 

A: We finished our work. We had a huge celeb
ration in November when the pa rtition pl an 
was announced...uh.......decided not to send transpor
ts thereafter because what was the 
point of...of that, and then changed our mi nds 
because it was a good idea to keep pressure 
on the British and have more people go to Cypr
us. So we did some what. Not a great deal 
though. Much of it by then was being done from
 Constansus or from Italy, not from 
France, and I simply don't know about those op
erations. One of the generalizations that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
38 
 
you have to know about is that none of us 
knew anything we didn't have to know. People 
keep asking me  did you know so and so who work
ed on this. One of my c l osest friends in 
the kibitz in Israel  is a man 
who was one of the leaders of 
the Berichah in Ital y. I never 
met hi m in Europe. I met him in 1960 when I got to the kibbutz because he was not my 

business. I knew what I had to know and nothi
ng else. In Wa shington, it's called "need to 
know." Uh...the doctrine of secrecy. But by Fe
bruary, March of 1948, it was clear that the 

State would come  in to be, and that our wo
rk, Berichah, would end. There would be lots 
of people at the camps, a lot of to become  Isra
elis would have to stay
 there. To help and 
to work and to teach and all the things th
at they we re doing lega
lly, but I was none of 
those things. My operation would end. I turn
ed down, with thanks, the suggestion, an 
urgent one, fr om of my...uh...Israeli fr iends th
at I take Esther a
nd our one and half 
children and go to Israel and fly for the upcom
ing air force which at
 that point had one 
and a half piper cubs, I think. I 
said, "No, Thanks, that...that is
n't how I wanted to die," as 
a matter (laughter) and decided 
very reluctantly to go home . 
Mostly because of the war. 
That there was a war comi ng was clear, and...uh
... I had had my war. So, in...uh...April of 
48, we tried to get out of Germany. It was almo
st as hard to get out of Germany as it was 
to get into Ge rmany because the Ame r ican Army had for ms and you had to fill them out, 

and a pregnant wife caused problems. We  want
ed desperately to go to Norway. I have a 
thing for Scandinavia, and ta
ke the Oslo home. They woul
dn't let us. The Oslo did not 
have a full-time  physician on board. Alt
hough my wife was having the healthiest 
pregnancy in the history of th
e world, but there had to be a ship with a doctor. The Ar my 
would not take responsibility. So we decide
d to come  home  on the SS America from 

Lauf, and we close up the house and shi
pped everything home. Michael was very 
disturbed because nothing he was ever
 going to see again. He was 3, and....uh...he 
couldn't bring his dog, and I think that bothe
red him more than anything else. He...uh...he 
really a me ss. But we got to Paris, settled in
 for a couple of days and went to the boat . 
Two of the people in the worl
d closest to us were Eva Kaufma n, now Eva Kaufma n Penn, 

and her late husband, Rabbi Jay Kaufma n. They had gone to Jerusalem in 1946 for Jay to 

get a doctorate at Hebrew University. Uh...The
y tried to leave the Un
ited States in the 
mi ddle of the Maritime strike, and they got he
ld up, and stayed at our house in Staten 
Island. When they left they were allowed to 
go, but they couldn't take the car. They had  
Palestine and stayed with us until Paul was done. It was this ki nd of relationship. Then 

they disappeared in the wilds of Jerusalem.
 Wh at we heard about them once in awhile 
was from Jay's parents who would drop us a 
note saying they got a letter. They were 
okay, and then we didn't get that any more fo
r awhile because Jeru
salem was under siege, 
and they were in the  of Jerusalem. We were in Paris, and we  went to  to the  and Michael 

was riding a little kiddie car up and down the 
platfor m, and we suddenly heard a scream. 

It was Eva. She and Jay had tickets for the 
same  ship to come  home . Coincidence. And 
she was 2 weeks more pregnant than Esther, a
nd we had a 5 day trip across the Atlantic 
which was an extraordinary experience, just  
trying to catch up with one another with 
these two very pregnant ladies. Their s
on, their first child, was born on Israel's  
independence day, and our second child was born 2 weeks later. I had had an offer from 

Henry Montaur, the head of the UJA, and the 
world's greatest fund raiser in all of history. 
I would add here that the 1948 UJA campaign raised a hundred and 80 million dollars. As 

of that date, that was the la
rgest fund raising campaign in pr
ivate hands in the history of 
the world. And it was not surpassed for quite awhile. Now, of course, it sounds like small 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135  
39 
 
money thanks to inflation, but it was an
 absolutely amazing out-pouring of money. 
Uh...And I spent 3 months doing speaking full time.
 One of my first speeches was on the 
night of Israel's  independence. I went to No
rfolk, Virginia, to sp
eak. Why was I sent to 
Norfolk?  Because the featur
ed speaker was the Se nator from Kentucky, Alban Berkley, 
shortly to become  Vice President of the 
United States. Now Barkley was one of the 
world's worst speakers in terms of content, 
but he was an affa ble pleasant guy and he 
loved Jews. And he went around ma king speeches 
for Jews and for Israel and for Zionism 
all the time . So he was to be the featured
 speaker. He ma de a very short speech. He 
walked over, wrapped himself in the Israel flag, and the cameras popped and I ma de a 

sort of content speech. Only later I discovere
d how much mo ney he was paid for all the 
speeches he made for the Zionist movement a
nd for Israel and for the UJA and the rest. 
Fortunately, I ma ke it a practice not to have il
lusions about public figures, so I didn't get 
disillusioned about him. Uh...He was  not a pleasant experience
. Most of them were very 
pleasant experiences because to watch peopl
e give more money than they ought to 
give...uh...has its beauties. And th
e statements they ma de. Uh...I didn't fight in the second 
World Wa r. I was too old. I was not involved 
in the decima tion of our people in Europe. 
Therefore, the least I can do is pay for 
it. And the money poured in. Unbelievable 
amounts of money. I learned to re
spect sacrificial gi
ving for the first time. There has been 
very little of it, of course, but
 I respect it when I find it. I 
was invited to go to Hawaii to 
open their campaign. That was exciting. Never 
been to Hawaii. And I understood that the 
Hawaii Jewish community was all excited. Wh
en you're that far away, you get more 
exciteme nt. Exciteme nt grows in direct 
proportion to the distance from the action. 
And...uh...Montra called, asked me  to go. I said, 
"What dates?" And he said, "Well, the 
affair is on June 2nd, but you would have to 
go a day or 2 early because it's a long way." 
And I said, "Forget it. Not me . We 'r e  due 
to have a baby right on June 2nd." And...uh...he 
kinda said, "So what?" And I understood that. I 
said, "Well, I wasn't  there when the first 
one was born, and I have solemn advice from my
 wife that if I a m not there when the 
second one is born, there won't be a third and I won't have a wife. And I believe her." 

And he was a little bit upset, but he  accep
ted that. As it happens, the child was born on 
June the lst so it was very sensible of me  to
 stay home . Those 3 months were exhilarating 
and exhausting. And then I settled down for the first time  since I had become  a Rabbi to 

be a Rabbi. I accepted a position at our semi nary 
to teach and to get my doctorate and we 
moved to Cincinnati and became people for the first time. No longer di d our son Michael 

get into a pullman berth and say, "Home," wh
ich he had done a number of times when he 
was 2 years old and traveling co
nstantly. I'm done. Finished. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: Unless you have some thing. 

 

Q: No. I don't think so. 

 
Conclusion of Interview.
