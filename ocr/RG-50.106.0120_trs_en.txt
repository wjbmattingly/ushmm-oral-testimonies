What is your fu ll name? 
Answer: 
Ro ma na  Koplewic z.  
Q: And your maiden name? 

A: 
Margitte
(ph). 
Q: And where were you born? 
A: 
Warsaw, Poland. 
Q: What was your date of birth? 
A: April 26, 1919.  
Q: Tell me something about your househ
old growing up, who you lived with ? 
A: I was living with my  parents and with 
my sister , which was six years older than 
me and played ex tremely important role in
 my life. It was rather a normal life. I 
attended private school all my life, and it 
was expected of me to do my  homework 
and to be a good student. And it was a gi
rls™ school. The name 
of the school was
 
Frieda Mierlos
(ph) in  
Wa rsa w
, and I went there from ki
ndergarten through 12 Œ 
no, the Œ I graduate gi Œ this was a gymna
sium, which I graduate in 1936. I became

d after this I apply to law school, which

wasn™t my first choice. Orig
inally I wanted to be a pe
diatrician, but since being 
Jewish it was impossible to get to medical school in
 Warsa w.
 I even mentioned to 
my parents that I would like to go to 
France
, but my  parents were old fashioned and 
the idea of a girl going to 
France
 didn™t appeal to them. Co
uld be if I would really 
fight, and wanted very  mu ch
, I would go, but the upbri
nging was totally different 
than it is now of young people. And I was 
two years in law school, which I didn™t 
finish because it was in subject that it 
was an cient law and middle age law which 
appealed to me. And then for a Œ before th
e war started, I was helping my father in 
his factory, where I was typing a little b
it, doing so me bookkeep
ing, but nothing to 
get excited. And then the war started Œ 
Q: Okay, let™s talk a little
 bit mo re about your home.
 Did you live in the town, 
within the to
wn center? 
A: In Œ in the city of 
Warsaw
 I was living, we had a very nice, comfortable 
apartment. I had the room wh
ich I share with my sister , 
which I adore. She paints 
my life wit h  roses. She was the best pers
on before I met my  husband, in my  en tire 
life. 
Q: And what was her name? 
A: 
Edith. Edith, Esfia
(ph). 
Q: Did you live in a Jewi
sh neig hborhood, or Œ

A: It was a Jewish Œ not a goo Œ not a nice
 neighborhood. I would say too, except 
the janitor, hundred percent pe
ople were Jewish. Had three courts. The name of the 
street was 
Simonhof
(ph)
 13. 
It wasn™t a nice neighborhood. 
Q: Why? In what sense? 
A: Why? The streets w ere narrow, the peop
le Œ the stores were ugly. Everything was 
Œ if anybody knows 
Wa rsa w
, they know that it wasn™t a nice neighborhood. I was 
walking to school, we had 
always a housekeeper and we
™re going for vacation, I 
went to camp. And I went 
even before the war to 
La tv ia
 to see my father™s family, 
my  grandmother, wh ich I hardly  knew, my  
aunts and uncles andcousins. And I had 
many, many friends and it was a nice, quiet
 life, I would say. I didn™t know any 
better. 

Q: Were your friends Jewish children? 

A: Majority of them were Jewish. As I sa
y, except the janitor and the housekeeper, 
everybody was Jewish. 
Q: And at school were your ot
her classmate s all Jewish a lso? 
A: This was a Jewish private school. 
However, my first encounter was in law 
school, where, you know, it was a slogan, down
 with  Jews. But the Jewish girls were 
the Œ we should be with the Jewish wo me
n but not with the Jewish men. And I

witnessed when they were
 cutting with the blades, 
the coats from the Jewish 
students, it was winter. Do you know what I am talking about? 
Q: Well, you want to tell us a little 
bit more about that? Who was doing it? 
A: It was tremendous hatred toward Jewi
sh students. I went to Un iversity of 
Joseph 
Pilsudski, 
which was Œ at this time he was dead
, because he died when  I graduate 
my  gymnasium. And the hatred, there were
 many things which couldn™t Œ Jews 
couldn™t get. The majority of Jews wh
o wanted to be physicians went to 
Italy
, to 
France, 
to 
Czechoslovakia
. And they tried everything, a
lthough some of them were 
very poor and it was very hard to  sup
port themselves overseas, but they were 
working as waiters and some help from th
e parents. However, since I was accepted 
to law school, and in  the beginning I th
ought maybe I™ll be a law-lawyer, and Œ 

however wh en the in structor professor wa
s coming to  the class and you know, the 

Jews were sit Œ standi
ng behind the benches 
and he said still, th
e Jewish student will 
not sit on th e left hand side, I will not star
t the lecture. And he was leaving, and this 
was right away totally chao
s in the class because the 
Christian were beating up 
immediately the Jewish male students. Th
e wo men they didn™t touch. And many 
times when I was walking on the street in 
Warsaw
, in so called mixed 
neighborhood 
[indecipherable]
 Christian, I saw men wh
o were attacked by young 
Christian boys.

Q: Did you yourself experience, an Œ I 
mean, I know you ob
served anti-Semitic 
incidents, did you yourself Œ 
A: I tell you, til the war Œ 
Q: Œ experience any? 
A: Œ I didn™t have any contact exactly, I didn™
t have any Christian friends. I Œ so i-I Œ 
I was very limited because I was living in 
a ghetto, you know, yeah. I was going to 
shows, and we went to opera. I remember ﬁ
Madame Butterfly
ﬂ was a Japanese 
song Œ singstress Œ sa Œ wo man who was si
nging. And however my  direct contact, 
so different from my  husband, who went 
to a state school, was totally different. 
Some of our teachers in my gymnasium we
re Christian, however, it was a different 
relation.  

Q: How religious was your family? 

A: My mother was a believer, my  father wa
sn™t. He Œ Friday within Œ my mother 
was lighting candles, but my  father wa
s never there because he was work ing 
Saturday . The business was open on Saturd ay and Su nday
 
he was off. And my 
mo ther was kosher Œ the home was kosher, 
however, my  father outside was eating 
not kosher. And I was not belie
ving at all, and my  mo ther
 was always very upset 
because she couldn™t understand why I can
not believe it. However, came a moment 
in her life when we™re thrown
 out Œ during the ghetto, from our ap artment and we™re

living not far from 
Umschlagplatz
. You know what is 
Umschlagplatz
? There were 
the trains were loading the Jews, and the 
Jews were going to the trains with the 
name of God 
[indecipherable]
 I heard this, I remembe
r. And she said, children, 
don™t believe in God. And I will never 
forget this because it was co ming from a 
woman who was so blindly belie
ving in God that if the hole would open in front of 
me, and I will go in, it would be less than to
 hear from my mother that there was no 
God. 
Q: Did you have any Jewish schooling?  
A: No. 

Q: Any training? 
A: No. I don™t know how to Œ I understa
nd Yiddish, and now 
when I am working 
with Russian refugees, they 
are very  happy when they hear. My Yiddish is very 
poor, but I can manage very nicely. And th ey getting much better rapport than to  Œ 
through translator, which I always have. 
And since I™m Polish, I understand Russian 
too. 
Q: What language did you speak at home? 

A: Polish. And I was angry at my par Œ at 
my  mo th er th at sh e 
didn™t speak, I was 
ashamed a little bit that she 
didn™t speak a perfect Polish. However, when we came

to this country and it came 
to my daughter friend, she 
said , wh y  y our mo mmy  i s 
talking Spanish? In her eyes it 
was that I was talking Spanish. 
Q: What were your parents™ name s? 
A: 
Maria
 and 
S am u el M a -M ag itte
(ph) 
Q: And what kind of work
 did your father do? 
A: My father had a factory, dyeing factor
y, where he employed 50 people. It was in 
his build ing, he had few of the real
 estate. H e was dyeing wool, silk, 
[indecipherable]
, rayon, felt, feathers, everything
 possible. And he had this Œ he 
came to 
Poland
 before the first w ar in 1914, I th
ink, and he built up to Œ he was a 
very comfortable man. 

Q: So you were consid
ered middle class? 
A: Yes, upper middle class. 
Q: Upper middle class. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. Why did you wa
nt to become a doctor? 
A: I loved children and I wanted  to be a pe
diatrician and I felt Œ alth ough I think I 
was wrong because I™m very poor with scie
nce, I am rather for humanities. And it 

was glamorous and that™s what I ar Œ but i Œ I Œ mo st likely i-it Œ it was not a strong 
wish, because I could go abroad
, my father could support me.

Q: T-Tell me what you were doing 
and what you remember from then. 

A: September first Œ sept Œ August 31
st
 or 30
th
, I came from my boyfr Œ in Œ not Œ 
not even a boyfriend, a frie
nd who is now my  husband. 
Q: How did you meet him?  
A: I met him in law school wh en he was 
Œ and thro ugh his brother-in-law, wh o was 
a lawyer for my father. So 
wh en  my  sister was going there which was helping my  
father in business, she said to his brothe
r-in-law, I have a very good looking sister 
and how about if we™ll introduce? And when 
he saw me he decide
d that he fell in 
love with me, most likely, but he was figh
ting Œ he wasn™t ready to get married, my  
husband. My  husband was thinking about 
having a child with a rather healthy 
Christian girl. Why Christian I don™t kn
ow, and to  raise the child right.

A: 1935. ™36, excuse me.

A: Yeah, but we never had a date. Then  th
e war start Œ wi Œ I met him Œ I Œ I don™t 
reme mb er if I knew that he is going. I went 
with my girlfriend to 
the country, to the 
mountains, it was August for a few weeks and he was there coming h Œ and I saw 
him, he was always wearing ti
ny shorts because he is a ve
ry good tennis player. So I 
always rememb er, and Œ and as a matter of fa
ct, he made the ji Œ I had the cold and I 
was sharing the room with a girlfriend and 
he came  in to find out about me, and he 
said make room. I was 20 years old and I go
t very insu lted and I didn™t talk to him 
for a week. I was very naïve, stupid.
 And th en I saw him occasionally, but 
whenever, as I said never 
had a date. He had some girlfriends and I have some 
boyfriends and the life went on, and in  th
e ghetto wh en the ghetto was being closed 
Œ we were in the part which was ghetto

Europe
 mostly are courts. The first 
one, the second and the third. 
You know, in Œ it was Œ i-in 
New York
 you have very 
few houses where they  have a court. Do 
you know what I™m talking? In the middle

ing in  the middle, th-they threw the bomb  
and killed some tenants and 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: This was your building? 
A: This was my building where I was livi
ng, but we™re living 
in the third one. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And we™re always running to th e ba
sement, I rememb er, because they were 
bombing to 
Warsaw
 Œ seven days and Œ and they right away walk ed  in. And the life 
changed comp letely. What I was doing, in th e beginning were able to go to  my  

father™ factory, which was still w o rking,

ghetto, his factory. And Œ

A: No, but you know, there 
were strictly Christian neighborhoods and Jewish 
neighborhoods. 
Q: You were in the Jewish neig hborhood. 
A: Yes, I was living in the Jewish neig
hborhood. And then  it came January  1940, 
my  sister moved with  her husband to us. 
Sh e had the different apartment, but we 
decided to  be togeth er. 
Q: From September to January, you were
 working at your father™s factory?

[indecipherable]
 
Q: Did you have enough fo od? 

A: Yes, yes. We were comfortable, and 
we had jewelry which 
later onwe™re selling 
to survive, so it wasn™t ba
d. I never suffered hunger. I Œ I didn™t have a place where 
to sleep later on when I was acting as a Ch
ristian, but I had money to buy food. And 
then in January, Gestapo came, three men from Gestapo and ask fo r 
Michael

were to

 and they  left a note. And when
 my father came back Œ that 
he should  go to the Gestapo 
they left a note Œ my  sister didn™t want to let him go to 
Gestapo but my  father Œ and 
we had a manager, my  father, of this dyeing plant, who 
was German descent. He 
was Polish, but he was a 
Volksdeutsche. 
His wife 
immediately, you know, decided to, because
 they had privileges, they were like 
Germans. And he went with them. My si
ster was standing outsi
de the Gestapo and 
her husband, they were marr
ied two years only, and this 
Œ this foreman, and they 
arrested him. 
Q: Arrested your brother-in-law? 

A: Yes, and since then we didn™t hear 
anything from them, and then we find out 
from other people, doctors, teachers, anyb
ody who had some educ
ation was arrested. 
300 men. My just Œ my  sister got very bu
sy with so me lawyer
s to find out what 
happened to them 
[indecipherable]
. Then we find out that 
they were killed right 
away in the forest near 
Warsaw
. This was the cream of a cream, you know, the elite 
of the Jewish intelligence. As a matter of
 fact, she had a nervous breakdown after. 
She became Œ she got a ne
rvous hiccup I remember, and she was going to 
neurologists. We never heard from them. And th en it was Œ we started to see Œ my  

father was extremely enterprising, decided,
 you know, that he 
will dye Œ he will be 
buying some linen and dyeing th is home an
d selling maybe to outsider, this Œ but

this didn™t work. Then he started to plan
t some vegetables in some lots near the 
houses. But by the time the vegetables were 
ripe, they were stolen by other people. 
He was trying ev erything, he was extrem
ely energetic, and Œ and he was even 
smuggling Œ wh en th e factory was Œ wh en 
the ghetto was closed
, to supervise the 
work, which it was there Œ 
Q: When  Œ when  did his factory close down ? 

A: I don™t remember, b u t it was walls and 
walls and we didn™t let him and he was 
denounced  by a janitor from the place where it 
was in the factory, that he said when 
Hitler
 will come, my father will kill him. Th
e Christian janitor said this. They 
arrested my  father and they 
put him in a space where he 
couldn™t stay, only he Œ he 
could see Œ sit with the knees, you know, 
like this here. In those days a number 
wasn™t called, they kept him 48 hours an
d they let him go, and he came back. 

Q: What month was this? 

A: I don™t remember. 
Q: Spring of Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ 1940. 
A: Yeah. It was getting worse and worse 
and from the small to
wn around the war 
zone, wh ich were German liquidating,
 they were bringing ev erybody to  
Wa rsa w
. So 

 
Interv iew with Ro ma

16
we had five rooms, two rooms we ha
d to let Œ to sublet for people from 
Lódz
, two 
families. A nd the quarters are getting sma
ller and smaller, we are sleeping in the 
dining ro om, we are sleep Œ an
d I was sleeping togeth er with my  sister. Altogether Œ 
the ration was bread whic
h wasn™t edible but 
[indecipherable]
 it was more sent that 
it was bread, but we didn™t suffer hung
er. However, was interesting, when 
somebody, when  the neighbors sometimes were
 coming, we were trying to clean up 
from the table, because not to 
show that we have food an
d maybe they don™t have it. 
And then  they liquidated second part of th
e ghetto which was in a different part of 
Warsaw
 and th ey brought ev
erybody to this part where we were.  
Q: So your house was alrea
dy in where the ghetto was Œ 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Okay . And th e ghetto was cl
osed off in October of 1940. 
A: Yes, but this time already 
we had two ghettos. In 1940, 
originally a different part 
of 
Warsaw
 had the ghetto, and wh ere I was livi
ng. Then, slowly, they liquidated the 
other part, and ev erybody was here, you know
. Don™t forget the me antime they were 
grabbing people mo re and mo re and se
nding and many people voluntary were 
coming because they were starving from hung
er. I remember some
 second or third 
cousin came. They took away her husba
nd. She came with two children to say 
goodbye. She said, I was told
 that there were work, and 
I will be able Œ they will

support us, and she wa
s going herself to 
Umschlagplatz.
 And there were many like 
this. They couldn™t survive. 
They were more and more d
ead body on th
e street in 
Warsaw, 
especially children, who are dying with
 their genitals covered with  those 
garbage flies. It was awful.
 And I reme mb er I was carrying in  a pack et stockings, 
which I was taking to somebody,
 you know, I Œ it is very ha
rd  for Œ when  you had to 
run, there were people who were fixing th
is. So a kid grabbed the bag from my  hand 
and started to eat. They  thought this is a br
own bag, that this is food. It was getting 
worse and worse, you know. The Gestapo an
d the Germans were beating up walking 
on the street. You couldn™t cross the street. A nd the walls which they built, you 
know, people were smuggling because ther
e was still some getting food. Kids were 
smuggling and they were killing those children near the walls, if they were carrying 

a bread, or something. It Œ and less and 
less people were, because the trains to 
Treblinka
 were going all the time. We didn™t know th e 
Treblinka
 Œ some people 
were even getting cards, come here because 
we are working and everything is fine. 
The German machine was so
 sophisticated and complic
ated, that they could 
accomplish that people voluntar
y were going. I-It was tota
lly unbelievable. And we 
were selling many things. I remember my 
mother had the chain wh ich was from my  
grandmother, and Œ and every time, you know
, we Œ we had to Œ there were still 
people who were sellin g this to the Christian.
 First of all, the first time we had to

give away  the radios, bring to th e precinct. 
Then the fur coats. Th
en everything that 
was valuable, they could come to you an
d Œ and clean up th
e whole house, you 
know, yeah. And the quarters
, living quarters were getti
ng smaller and smaller. My 
mo ther was kosher, and my  father brought, how you call 
slonina
, felt from the pig? 
How you call in eng Œ 
Q: Lard? 

A: Lard, yeah. And h-he brought a big pi
ece, and she was, you know, a Œ how you 
call Œ 

Q: Cooking? 

A: Not cooking only, 
because it was a piece, so she ha
d to make like butter, how Œ 
how you say Œ 

Q: Melting it. 

A: Melting it. And she said, I™m 
Œ and he told her that this 
is lamb fat. And she said, 
I wonder why I didn™t Œ why we didn™t use th
is before the war, it tastes so good, you 
know. She was very naïve in 
this respect. And he was mu
ch more enterprising, he 
was a very strong man. When  you coul
dn™t get coal, and our ap artment were 
warming u Œ warm up by co al
, he brought half a ton of co al up on the 10
th
 floor on 
his back. And then it came that th ey move
d Œ they started to 
build the shops for 
German industry, you know, we were work i
ng. First of all they
 throw us out from

this apartment, there were still four of
 us, from the ghetto. A
nd th ey took Œ they  
gave us one room near the 
Umschlagplatz
 where Œ 
Q: Do you remember when  this was? 
A: May I ask

Q: That™s all right, okay. 

A: We were there a short time. Few mont
hs, I think we were. So we left the 
apartment the way we were. We weren™t a
llowed to take anything. We went down  

and I will never Œ one room and it happened 
that this apartment, I met later a woman 
who surv ived 
Russia
, was her parents™ apartment. I w
ill never forget this apartment 
because the bedbugs were
 coming from the ceiling. 
Q: This is the new place? 

A: The new place, yeah. And it was a balc
ony and we heard th
e trains coming and 
the Jews going to th e train, and praying to
 God. And it was constant. The trains were 
going constantly. And then they  opened  th
e Germans shops, and we were able Œ I 
an d  my  Œ  my  mo th er, wh en  we
™re going to the shops we™re hiding her. We put a big 
closet, you know, and cove
r part of the wall and 
[indecipherable] 
because she 
couldn™t work. She Œ sh e had 
heavy arthritis and she was 
overweight. So my father 
was working in a different shop and my sist
er and myself were working not far from

my  father in a different shop.
 The name of the shop was 
[indecipherable]
 
roefrich, 
r-o-e-f-r-i-c-h, 
from 
[indeciphera ble]
 and we™re sewing uniforms. There I met part 
Jews, which I never met before, it was the working class of Jews. 
Bund, b-u-n-d.
 
And they  were singing the Jewish songs very, you know 
[indecipherable]
 you 
know, all those 
[indecipherable]
 and Œ you know, and they were those one who 
started later the uprising. They were very, ve
ry important Jews that I met in my life, 
which some of them survived
. And they were much more
 doing for the Jews than 
people like me, who was a Jewish  princess. 
And then  we™re sewing, but then  started 
selection. All the time the Gestapo was co
ming. We all had to go outside and they 
were looking if there were older people or
 some people who had the pimp le on the 
nose or something, they were taking away
. And meantime there was, in 1942, the 
street of Œ name was
 Millar
(ph) and this time was a big selection and th ey took 
tremendous amount of Jews. 
And I will never forget my
 neighbors, who had the 
little girl
 M a rilka
(ph) and they  put her in a suitc
ase and they made holes in the 
suitcase for air. However, she started to cr
y. They were living on the same house, 
and Germans put the cara Œ machi Œ guns, and sh
ot this suitcase, as Œ this couple left 
the suitcase and walked away. 
There are things which always stays in your mind. So  
there were less and less Jews in the ghetto 
because they were k
illed, or they were 
taking to  
Treblinka
. We didn™t notice the Œ there were some people who are coming

from 
Treblinka
 who threw themselves together 
with the clothing, because they 
were telling them that you have to go and 
you know, to the show
er and this Œ those 
things, you know. So, you know
, some of them who are helping to so rt the clothes 
into this, th-the shoes, 
and Œ th-they got back to 
Warsaw
 and they say remember, 
Treblinka
 has ba Œ is burning Œ crematoriums 
are working day and night. So with 
that already, the idea that this is not that
 they are sending them to work, only they 
are sending them to be killed. 

Q: So you were called out some
 Œ for selectio ns that time? 
A: I was not, no, because we™re young. My sister and I were young, and my father, 
who was this time in the late 50™s was 
hiding when  they were calling. You know, 
you never knew for whom they we
re looking. However, one week Œ 
Q: Were you ever called down to Œ to th
e street? You were never called down  to Œ 
A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: However, once we came, and the hot soup 
was on the table, my  mo ther was gone. 
She came out from this hiding place to cook
 the soup fo r us, and th ey came and they 
took her away. I run to 
Umschlagplatz,
 but she was gone. We continued wo rk, and 
once I came and I heard that they 
took my sister. And I went to 
Umschlag pla tz
 and 
they told me that she was on 
th is and this train, which was staying, and I entered the

train. When I was in the train, they told me that
 my sist er was hiding, that she wasn™t 
on th at train, and I decided to ju mp . It wa
sn™t Œ the train was just moving, so  I Œ I 
wasn™t a heroine, you know. 
They helped  me, you know, and th ey picked me up and 
through the window, because the doors were 
locked. My sister he
ard that I was in 
the train, she went to the other train. Sh
e was extr Œ extremely important to me. In 
the same time, we jumped from two differe
nt wagons and we met on th e outside of 
the train and we went back to the ghetto. 
And my father was sitting on the floor near 
the door. He said, I knew that you will come
 back. We decided that we have to do 
something to  leave the ghetto because we 
didn™t have a chance. My father knew a 
man, a Christian, he was a lawyer, who 
took over the management of his factory. 
And through him we got false papers for 
my sister and for my
self. I was looking 
more like Christian than her, because the wh
ole Jewish tragedy was in her eyes. You 
know, they say 
[indecipherable]
 in Jewish eyes, there is such a thing. I was always 
smiling and Œ and really, although Œ and my
 Polish and her Polis
h was excellent, and 
this was extremely imp o rtant. And we said
 Œ and it was very hard for her to move 
around because she could be 
very easy recognized. So  through th is man he found 
somebody, and she was sitting 
mostly inside. This was April, before the uprising. 
Q: April 1943.

A: Yes. And I got papers too, and I went 
Œ I rented somebody Œ my  friend told me 
that she™s coming back to th
e ghetto because he
r husband Œ as a man you didn™t have 
a chance, because of circumcision. And I 
took over her room. And I was working in 
the ghetto as a Christian this 
time. I could see my father, I 
had papers as a Christian. 
Q: What kind of wo rk
 were you doing? 
A: This was factory for 
Germany
. 
Q: Manufacturing work . 
A: Yeah, I was very gutsy. They were maki
ng Œ I Œ from lead or something. It was a 
short time. I was comi ng in  the mo rning, an
d leaving five o™clock. This time I could 
al Œ I could always bring fo r my  fath
er some food, who was in a different 
[indecipherable]
 this time. My sister was alre
ady on th e false paper hidden, you 
know. And then it was Passover, the first 
Seder
, Sunday night and 
I stayed, I wanted 
to be with my father. And he asked me st
ay there today, maybe it was Sunday night. 
I say okay, I will stay. And the next morn
ing when I got up, it was Monday, I found 
out that the uprising was, but it was in diffe
rent Œ it was in the part of the ghetto 
where my  husband was. And I got dressed,
 I had the coat with the collar from a 
rabbit. Jews weren™t allowed, so when I 
went to the false paper, I bought myself a 
rabbit and I put to my  coat to
 look more like Christian. An
d I went to the guard and I 
passed the Œ it was a house ba Œ from Œ who 
had two entrances from the street. The

Jews in towers were staying in
 the court and praying to God.
 It was quiet in this part 
of the ghetto because the up
rising started there. And I we
nt to the guard, I showed 
him the papers. He said , what youare doing in the ghetto? I said 
[in d ecipherable]
 
caught me, and I decided I didn™t have a ch
oice, I had to stay. He looked at me, he 
looked at the paper, and as I say, the number was 
[indecipherable]
 and he let me 
through. And near the guard  were
 children six, seven years old, 
J ude, J ude
, waiting 
for the Jews to show them to
 the German. I had guts, and 
I walked in with my head 
up. And my  sister, ma ybe one street from 
th ere she was waiting. She knew that to 
get out I had to come there. She knew that
 Œ she was sure that she will never see me. 
And I met her and I said, don™t go in th
ere, because it was the worst time. The 
Polacks were showing left and right, you know, and th ey could recognize me. No 

Germans stopped me in two and a half ye
ars. But the Po lacks, who knew me from 
university one, my husb Œ my father™s wo

because this man, my father gave him 
money, and whenever I needed. And there 
was incident when I was living in the room
, in the furnished room, there was a little 
boy, the first question he asked 
me, if I ever saw a Jew. So I 
said yes. Is this true that 
Jew have a tail? I said, I don™t think so, bu

uprising in ghetto, I Œ I knew that I have
 a father there and I had a husband Œ

went to the wall, and I was looking and ne
xt to me was standing a Ch ristian woman 
and she said, very good that
 they burning the Jews, onl
y they spoiling our Easter. 
This was 
vox populi
, it wasn™t a single voice, everybody felt the same way. As I 
was living in  this furnished room, once is
 coming a woman and she said to me, may 
I see your papers? I said yes. Wh at happe
ned to the wo man wh ich was living here 
before, she was Jewish, are you Jewish, too? I said, I don™t know if Œ I never met 
her, but I™m not Jewish. She said, anyway, we
™ll go to Gestapo. She Œ it was after the 
curfew. She was a Polish woman, but she 
was working fo r the Germans, and she Œ 
we™re walking, it was quite a walk. We were
 walking, I said look, I can give you 
money, I have a watch, let me go. She 
said no, we™re going.
 Suddenly she got 
tremendous pain, and we stopped near the 
pharmacy where she was ringing the bell, 
it was after the curfew. And the owner was 
living in the same 
building, opened the 
door for us, and we walked 
in and she said to him, if
 you will let her go, she is 
Jewish, you will be killed too. You have
 to help me. And he gave her some 
medication, I don™t rememb er, and she co
ntinued to walk with me. We™re maybe 

quarter of a mile from Gestapo, she said gi
ve me the money and give me the watch. 
I will 
[indecipherable]
 but I will not do anything to 
you. And I didn™t move. I get 
out from this room and I didn™t have a place
 where to go. I went
 to the hotel in a 
very nice neighborhood in

who took my papers said, I am sure your
 papers are all right because Gestapo is 
coming every night and checking the papers. I didn™t have a choice. I said, my  
papers are okay. And I was sleeping th er
e, nobody came. And I was looking through 
the window, and I wanted to 
commit suicide. I had nothing
 to lose. And I said, if 
they will find me, they will not know even 
who am I. But I was young, an-and I said 

no, you cannot give up. And 
the next morning I walked on the street, and I met my 

friend, a Jewish wo man who was work ing as
 a governess, French governess. She 
was studying medicine in 
France
 and her French was perfe

friendly. She was working for a very nice fa

And she said Œ I said,

dawned on me. They once were 
going to confession, so sh

were such a little things which Œ here 
I am coming from a family which wasn ™t

Then  nobody was touching you, you know,

sud on th e floor and then you 
Œ you had to put clear water 
to remove the soap. So I 
was swimming in the sud and I didn™t know 
that you need clear water. And I was 
there and it was rather good, you know. I Œ my

I couldn™t become blonde somehow, I Œ I™m very dark , now

Q: Let™s go back. Did you ever

Her mother Jewish was atrocious
 
Œ Po lish was atrocious, so she pretended that she

I was telling them when we™re 
sitting there, the first train I will be sitting,

And then , you know, I heard that
 there is a job on a farm, 
to milk the cows, to help 
with the far Œ I was all used to farm lik
e Œ now I would go, maybe as astronaut I 
would be better. So I went there and there 
was a wife after a Œ a Œ a widow after a 
judge and a big farm. And she said to me
, do you know how to milk the cow? I 
figured, what™s a Œ wha-what™s so easy th
 Œ bi-big deal, you 
know? I was wearing 
silk stockings, and my  Polish was so go
od and my  handwriting was so good. You 
know, for a maid in 
Poland
, who were mostly illiterate, but
 I told them that I w as 
work ing as a bookkeeper in this different 
city. So now I Œ since I mo ved, my  parents 
die, everybody, you know, to

they were dead. And she says okay, so m ilk this cow. I started to pull, kill me, 
couldn™t get a drop of milk and the flies 
were biting me through th e stockings and 
the cow was hitting me with the tail. A

don™t look like a girl who knows Œ who 
was working on a farm. I am sorry, but I 
cannot keep you. I left again. 
In between there, there were 
jobs where I felt that this

 wh en I was going to get my

End of Tape One, Side A

, which was the official germ Œ 
German document to live in occupied 
Poland. 
And wh en  I went on the way there to 
this German office where they were giving the 
Kennkarta
 with my  picture, I had a 
picture with my nose like this, I Œ you w
ill see the picture. And on the way there 
somebody stole from me the Œ the Œ my  po
cketbook. And I didn™t have the birth 
certificate. And I called up this man, Mr. 
Rokulski
(ph), he said, I cannot get Œ you 
have to go to the Church  of che Œ of 
Three Crosses, that was a big church in 
Poland,

be if I would ask for death certificate, 
they would give me too. So again I went and I got the

 wh ich w Œ and a

, work  paper, which was extremely important because when  the 
Germans were stopping me, when I had the 
arbeitkarta, 
this work 
ka rta

me loose. My dream was to get to

, to work in 
Germany
 as a Polish girl. 
However, you couldn™t volunteer, because 
if they would s

volunteer, there was a priest who was spec

see right away that the woman, you know, w

 voluntary to go to  
work  as a Œ in labor camp. So my  only hope 
was to be caught by the German, and to 
send to 
Germany
. But because of my

they never Œ I went to library,

Garmisch-Partenkirchen

I went there to this office. Well, the mo
ment I walked in, I saw that I made a 
mistake. There was sitting a 
Polis Deutsche
, a Polack who was a German, a German 
descent. And I rememb er him when I was 
working when the ghetto started. You 
know, they took 
the Jews to work to

A: Yeah. After the three mont

with a woman who was a white Russian. Sh

Russia

Poland

to
 Chin a

Volksdeutsche, 
again. He recognize 
me, but I was good for him and he was good 
for me, because he knew that is coming 
end of the war, and he had 
the uniform. Once, I took the 
unifo rm and I put on the 
balcony, and I thought that he will kill 
me. He grabbed the uniform because he 
didn™t want any Po lacks to know th at he™s a 
Volksdeutsche.
 You know, 
Volksdeutsche 
was a person who was born from German descent. 
Lempke
(ph) was 
his name. It was and it wasn™t a German name, but it was convenien t. He got the 

Polish villa in the country 
from a Œ a Œ a Jewish villa, 
where Jews used to go, a 
beautiful ap artment and he awa Œ had a se
wing Œ a salon, you know, where she had 
the manager, and wo men sewing dresses ma
de to order. Everything that they had 
was from Jews, different mo nograms, you know.
 And th Œ he had 
girlfriend, because 
when  the telephone was ringing, when  
I was picking up, nobody answered. 
However, when  he was picki

curfew hours, eight o™clock. I was singing

was buying. I said, oh, I bought this in 
a flea market. And she said, it looks like a Œ 
from a rich Jewish woman. Those were my 
own th ings, few things that I had, the 
black dress with a pin so mething. And I was wearing a black dress and a wh ite a Œ 

white, you know, apron, and I 
walked to the room and I saw a German sitting in the 

unifo rm among her guests. And I got so scared
 that I fell d o wn, together with a tray, 
with the food on the tray. Sh

Warsaw.
 
The Polish uprising, had nothing to  do wi
th  Jewish. And the Ge

 Warsaw

 Vistula.
 It was

they were their worst enemies. W h en th

But this was impossible, because

Russian were coming, and it was an hour away, but they stop because the stupid 
Polacks, they said, we™re going to fight fo r our capital. So it was not here and not 

there. October 15, evacuate the whole 
Wa rsa w

 Australia
 was staying in the sewers with 
rats and mi ce and her legs when  she 
came out were so swollen, because 
Warsaw 
was totally flat now. We had one skyscrap

were flying so low, the Germans, that we
™re hidden in the basement and part of the 
basement was destroyed because 
Poland
 didn™t have anything to defend. They 

didn™t have before and they didn™t have fo

And they put us on the trains.

we saved up 1,000 dollars the first year. 
Q: Did you get any more education? 

A: I Œ I got my Œ I went back to

 I started to take some c-courses in 
Queens College, 
and then we moved. We adopted  
our daughter in 1959, and we

New Hy de Pa rk

Q: Can we talk now, to 
finish up, some of your

A: I was interrupt you too. 

Q: And have you talked about your
 war experiences to your ch ildren? 
A: Yes. My daughter 
[indecipherable]
 however, my son is ex
tremely interested. In 
the Second Generation he was with 
Ralph Wallenberg, 
you know, was very active. 
He was with 
S-Simon Wiesenthal
 ar Œ all over, you know, yeah. He was here when  
this was being built. 

Q: How do you feel about 
getting reparations? What are 
your feelings about that? 
A: I feel we deserve. I don™t believe they 
sh ould pay us for my  
mother, father, sister, 
anybody would never accept. But for the 
suffering, you know, that we went, 
positively I feel positive that no matter how 
much they are payi
ng us, they should 
pay.  
Q: How do you feel about 
being Jewish? Has that chan
ged because of your war 
experience? 
A: I tell you, because of my work experience Œ 
Q: War experience.

A: War experience. I am more
 Jewish than I ever was be
fore. I am n o t religious, I 
am not a believer. I believe in fate, I be
lieve maybe there is something which I 
cannot name. I am a better person, maybe because of the suffering. I was, as I to ld 
you, a Jewish Polish princess, selfish. I 
was the younger, my  Œ my  sis Œ between my  
sister, which spoiled me and my  parents. 
I Œ I think I am a good person, I feel. And 
on my  job I am getting tremendous rewards. Th
at people are asking that they want to 
be with me, and my  supervisor, wh ich feels that I am one in a million, and my  

director who, I had th e husband wh ere I had 
to be Œ with all the 
surgery I was taking 
off, and they went for ever
ything. They were 
helping me unbelievable. I was going 
in the morning to the hospita
l, working one o™clock to 
five, coming back, taking off. 
They really Œ they wh
en  Œ totally we have thousand pe
ople working, this is a very 
big organization and a wonderful, which is
 giving Œ getting from
 philanthropes and 
half government is paying. 
Q: Does the war still affect you? 
A: Yes. 
Q: In what way? 

A: Depression. Sleepless nights, crying spe
ll, changing moods. I sounds like a social 
worker, but this is true. A song can 
[indecipherable]
 I very easy to  cry. A song, a 
picture, some similarity, and my  si Œ yo
u know, I never buried th em. This is the

56
story. My son when  he was younger he insi
sts that I should go, he said Mom, once 
forever you have to bury. And I went to a 
well known psychiatrist
 and he said your 
son maybe is right, however he doesn™t kn
ow that you were a 
grown up person when  
it happened. You will never bury  them, you will live as 
[indecipherable]
 sister. I 
don™t think that 
[indecipherable]
 that I don™t reme
mb er my  sister .  
Q: Is there anything else you wish 
to say, that you want to share? 
A: That it can hap Œ I Œ over and over again, that people, especially when  I am 
talking on here longer than an
y other place, and I am Americ
an patriot and I feel this 
is a wonderful country, that American Jews
 are very shortsighted, that they don™t 
realize, even though here 
the Turks, that the Greek an
d the Italian are looking like 
Jews, and this like that, and we had the s
capegoat, we had blac
k people, which are Œ 
refuse any mo re to be scapegoats, but this
 can happen. Even  with a strong club, that 
would happen. This is the way I feel. 
And th e mo re, you know, and Œ and I was 

maybe selfish because I wanted to save my
 own feelings. I didn™t want to come and 
to talk and to dig out and th
en Œ but at certain  moment 
it was pressure from our son, 
too, who is a psychiatrist, so Œ and he sa
id, I rememb er the holidays and always you 
were crying. You know, when Passover, it was 
Seder
 or something like this. And Œ 
and you were always talki
ng how was it, you know, and Œ 
and the memo ries and he 
said now Œ now that we have holidays, mo
stly we™re going to her Œ to my daughter-

in-law parents, which are second generate
 Œ first gen Œ her parents were Œ her 
parents were from 
Hungary
 or 
Ro ma nia
 and he is too, but they are totally 
Americanized, very well-to-
do people. And Œ and they  
ha Œ nobody cries, nobody 
talks about anything. Th-Th 
Œ different story. However, 
we™re going for the second 
Seder
 to a young co uple whose fath er was an editor of Jewish 
[indecipherable]
. 
And she reads in Yiddish, you know, about the 
[indecipherable]
 ghetto and my  son 
writes in English. And it ha
s a meaning, you know? I 
became more, not religious, 
only more traditional, yo
u know, yeah. And I feel this is
 very little ah Œ I wou Œ if Œ 
if my  son wouldn™t be born here, we wo
uldn™t circumcise him mo st likely. And 
anyway, he was circumcise
d by the doctor, not by a 
moyl. 
A-And Œ however, he Œ 
now that I have three grandson, wonderfu
l three boys, and I-I would like Œ I would 
like a ni Œ and I don™t know if I would like 
because for example, after the war, that I 
didn™t know that my husband survive or
 no, I could never ma
rry the Gentile. And 
many people just drop Œ they said Œ wh ich,
 you cannot blame them, decided enough 
of being Jewish. Wh en I decided to go back
 to school, you know, I didn™t know Œ I Œ 
I wanted to be a librarian 
because I liked to 
read, but then I was discouraged. And 
then after thinking over and between my hu
sband and my  son, you know, they said 
that I Œ I Œ I Œ I should help people, yo
u know. So I was work
ing, when I got my 
Master™s degree in a state mental institu
tion for 13 years, which wasn™t that

rewarding because I couldn™
t do too much for them a
nd you need some happy 
ending. Bu t I Œ even there, I was expo sed to  tremendous suffering, wh ich to 
compare to my, you know, those were people
 which were out, tota
lly. They di Œ they 
didn™t know what Œ they were for 50 years 
in a mental in stitution. And then when it 
came the time for psychotropic drugs, you kno
w, they  started to give them, and Œ 
and then they started to discharge them to nursing home which were worse than hell. 

And it Œ thro ugh all those years I did lots
 of growing you know, betw een the war 
and between my  wo rk, you know, I became 
extremely Œ mu ch mo re tolerant and Œ 
and a mu ch better person th an I ev er would 
be, even not all those things. That™s it. 
Q: That™s it? Oh Œ

A: Going back to my  life during Œ starting 
August first, where it was uprising, Polish 

uprising in 
Warsaw
. There was time where there 
was nothing to  eat because 
Warsaw
 was surrounded by Germans, and on the wa Œ 
Vistula  
river by 
Russia
 
there was no food co ming in. All the horses were eaten up. This reminds me on the 
revolution in  
France
 when they were eating rats and mice. There was Œ this was 
Armia Ludowa 
and 
Armia Krajowa. 
This was one which was 
to the left and one 
was to the right. The 
Armia Krajowa
 was very much agains

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
A: Œ Jewish, and I was work ing in the bui
lding there, who belongs to well know 
Emil Wedel
, who was German descent, but he ne
ver declared himself as a German. 
There was a Œ one of the best fa
ctory of chocolate which existed
 
now, 
E. Wedel, w-
e-d-e-l. 
And I Œ the people were Œ for whom I wa
s working as a maid were Œ had the 
apartment in the same build
ing and the ones, the soldiers who were fighting, the 
Polish soldiers, not officia
lly soldiers, but to defend 
Wa rsa w
, they were cooking in 
our court, this was barley and some kasha,
 and th ey were Œ supposedly told  me that 
it was a horse, but then we find out that 
it was a Œ a dog Œ a dachshund who belong 
to a well known Polish writer, 
Maria Rodzewiczkofna, 
very hard  name to 
pronounce, 
r-o-d-z-e-w-i-c-z-k-o -f-n-a. 
And then, the second 
time they caught some 
kids, I don™t know where, 
because the uprising started August first and it was til 
October where the Polish people have to 
capitulate because the Germans by air were 
throwing bomb s and marching, occupying back the
 Wa rsa w
 which for a short time 
was in Polish hands. And there it was a cat 
cooked together with 
all the ingredients. 
When  I ate this I didn't know, I didn™t ge
t sick, but I was young, and actually it 
didn™t matter what I was eating. 
Q: When you found out.

A: When I found out, yeah
. But then it was written a boo
k by somebody, by a Polish 
writer and she mentioned this 
[indecipherable]
 dog. I don™t know if the dog has a 
name. But anything that was alive those da
ys was doomed to be
 killed for food. One 
of the Œ after the war, when we™re Œ 
I was working with my  husband in 
Ló dz
 and I 
saw Mrs.
 Lempke
(ph). This was the wo man which Œ where I was working on my  
last job on a maid. She didn't see me, and I 
said to my  husband, you should hit her a 
few times. And my husband said, she is a 
head taller than me, how can I do it? And 
she wasn™t good to you, you su rvi Œ she wa
sn™t bad to  you, you surv ive. So  why Œ 
why do you want me to harm her? I cannot 
do anything, right? And this was the end. 
But I had a strange feeling that always
 I would Œ I-I would never go back to 
Pola nd , 
never, never. Now we™re 
Œ financially we™re okay, that
 is out of question, but I 
remember when we we™re struggling, I alwa
ys used to say, if anybody would put a 
million dollars under co ndition that we™ll go to 
Poland
 to  visit, I wouldn™t go. I hate 
everything that they did for us. And 
I hated that in a normal country like 
Denmark
, 
even French were Œ was a excellent unde
rg round, although th ey have their own 
Gestapo, 
Ma qu is
 and in  other countries you hear so many beau tiful stories. And 
that™s true that the nuns helped me, and 
there were other Polacks, but it is such a 
small percentage. Well, a Œ mostly a Œ we

before the war, you know, the Œ there was 
tremendous hatred always. And I am sorry that I was born in 
Poland,
 not here.
 Joe? 
Q: Any other Œ 
A: Do you want Œ 
Q: Œ stories that you rememb er, that
 you would like to add, any other Œ 
A: I tell you, I had a good childhood, an
d I was 20 years old in 1939, and lo oking 
back, you know, maybe I didn™t know any 
better. However, when I think Œ when I 
got my  Œ graduated gymnasium, I thought th
at I would conquer the world. I had so 
many dreams which were neve
r fulfilled, and I didn™t re
alize, maybe becauseI was 
stupid, or young, that so many things 
were off the limits for us Jews in 
Poland
. 
They  were talking ab out engineers jokingly, 
that they are to me
asure the street. The 
doctors, if they didn™t marry
 the rich girl, he couldn™t 
open the office. Lawyers, the 
bar were closed for Jewish lawyers, young
 one. A Jew couldn't be a janitor, a Jew 
couldn™t be a chimney cleaner. A Jew couldn
™t get a city job. And now living here 
for 44 years and to see wh at the opportunities everybod
y can have, I am for su re 
reinforce that it was th e wrong place of
 birth for us. And I see how people are 
coming from different country, wo rking in  my
 capacity, what the 
help they getting, 
what the chances they have to
 be somebody, to develop, 
to educate. To compare to
