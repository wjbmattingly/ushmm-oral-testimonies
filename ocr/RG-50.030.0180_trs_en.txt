Q: Will you tell me your name a
nd when and where you were born?  
 
A: My name  is Mina Glucksma n, my maiden
 name . Mina Glucksma n. I was born in Poland 
in Tyczyn near in a small town. It was in this town 3,000 Jews...about 300 fa milies, but 

everybody had 8 children, 10 children, so it wa
s like 3,000, I think, Jews when the war 

started. And I...I and my ...my parents were 
very Hasidic Jews. We  built a house. We  had 
a house from Great Grandfather. My...my fath
er had the house from Great Grandfather 
and then it was very old. Eight ye
ars before the war we built...over there 
wasn't ...was n't...uh..that you can...uh...uh..for...for th
at you can pay off...only you had to 
have money to build so they put together 
penny to penny to be able to build a new home 
because the children started to
 gr ow up. So 8 years before the war, my...my parents built 
a new home  and...and the old home we took ap
art. My father was...had...my mother and 
father had the business, a grocery store, 
but in Poland a grocery store was not only 
groceries for sale only they were buyi
ng from the  far mers there. They were 
buying...uh...the products like...like...uh, eggs, 
and grain and...and everything from 
the...and...and they came and insist and my 
father was buying the ...he took...he took the 
working people what they picked the f
ood and this we..we exported to Cartovich. 
We...my...my...father and mother 
had a very big business, but from this business we had 
only a living, because mostly went to the governme nt for taxes. They taxe d the Jews...the 

Jews very high. So, here he would be a ri
ch ma n. Over there, we were...we were...uh... 
average, not too rich, not too... You want fr
om the...before the war, so I tell you. My 
mother...in this town was few fa milies what they were very poor. They have ma ny 
children and they were very poor so my mo
ther every week, Thursday, she packed few 
packages to take to the poor one...to the poor
 fami lies and when they came from public 
school, she gave me  this to...to...to deliver to this
 fa mily. It was 2 kilome ters  to the east, 
prunes, sugar, eggs, to have for them for . So this every week, and I had to hid this 
because she didn't want people to know that 
she deliver ed to this families because this 
fa milies were ashame d to be poor." So we were
 Jews and my father brought always from 

the a beggars. They came over there for  fo
r the meals. He brought sometimes 2, 3 and 
some how my mother find always enough food 
for everybody. And this was only for the  
meal. So from s mall kids we learned how 
to give...how to give to...to people what 
shared... to people what they don't have. And we
 wasn't  rich but when a beggar come  in, 
he never went out hungry from us. My brothe
rs went to the Yeshiva". They were...they 
were...they were real Yeshiva boys. My fa
ther was a very Hasidic ma n and my 
mother...wore a wig. And on , my father wa
s wearing his . I don't know whether you 

know what a  and in...silk , and they were ve
ry, very Hasidic . Our fa mily, my mother's 
special fami ly...was a child didn't...didn't 
have to say a by...by a ma rriage who...uh...they 
want this or this. The parents ma de the ma
rriages, so I was like a rebelling. And it was 
hurting very much my parents that I didn'
t want to ma rry a Hasidic boy. I told my 
mother...I promised my mother, "Listen, Mo
mmy. You want me  to..." I talked to her 
always Jewish. "You want me  to be happy?" So
 she says, "Yes. What you are asking such 
a silly question?" So I told, "So let me ...let 
me  match to me  a boy and to you I swear I

will not go with a lower fa mily that we are. 
If...if I...I will never look on a boy what is in 
a lower fami ly." And this I reme mbered even af
ter the war, that I promised her, even she 
wasn't  alive and it was hurting me after the wa
r very much that I didn't give her this...I 
should ma rry a "Hasidic boy and gave...give the 
"Nahas from me . I had two brothers and 

I was painting from s ma ll kid. And I want my 
pa rents to...to let me  to go in art school. 
They say you are already a girl, 
not a girl, and that I didn't wa
nt to follow this everything 
what they want me  to follow to ma rry the Hasidic boy. And you paint enough good. You 

sell already your pain
ting. Show me  one girl that 
know how to paint like you. I was 
writing be fore the war poems. I was painting. I 
wa s...I was think I will be  a...I will be 
some thing very big, but when...when the wa
r came , everything was going to the drain. 

Then I had two brothers and a 
sister. My sister was a small 
child. I was also a leader of 
the "Ike ba what was hurting very much my parents because over there was boys and 

girls. I was not...uh...uh...it was half religion or
ganization, but a funny way. It was against 
my parents' will. So I was leader in th
e...in the "Ikeba, and it was...when it was 
"Pakisha... This means when every leader came t
ogether I never told my
 parents that I am 
going from t he "Pakisha and I go to my Gra
ndparents...to my  Grandparents over there to 
visit. And I went to the "Pak
isha. I left here a picture from this. Then...then, also I was 
taking private lessons because they didn't le
t me  go only...they let me  go in only they let 
me  go only in the business school. In bus
iness school, I finished business school. 
But...but they didn't let me go gymnasium and 
this, so I took privat
e lessons philosophy. 
Later to graduate I took privat
e lessons. And when I sold pict
ures I paid for the lessons. 
Then...then...uh...then it came my...when...when it 
came they war, when they marched in, 
we were in Krakow. My brothers and I we 
went to Krakow, because we were going to 
move from t his small town to Krakow. We  love
 it Krakow. So I with my brothers were in 
Krakow, and my mother came to visit us one
 time and...and we were going to ma ke...my 
brothers were going to ma ke a business for my
 father to sell everyt
hing over there, the 
house and everything to come  to a bigger tow
n, to a bigger city. My brother...my father 
had over there two brothers in the same  city. 
He had two sisters in United States from 
before the wa r. That's why I have the pictures
 or not I wouldn't  have pictures because he 
was sending the pictures to his sisters and 
when I came to the United States they were 
still alive, so they gave me  the pictures. A
nd one...in here one sister, my mother had...was 
from six children so they have all the 
children. This...everything went to the gas 
chambers, but my...when the...when...1939, when the war started, we were in Krakow. 

My brothers went right now when they hear it
 will be war, they went right now home  to 
the small town to Tyczyn because they were thin
king that  they will be enlisted to the...to 
fight the Germans so they went and I was s
till left  over there. But when I saw there 
ma rching in..in 1939 the first...in the...in the fi
rst of September, I was thinking I will not 
be in Germany and they will be in Poland because I saw they are moving very fast so I 

started to...to...I went on a tr
ain to go home  but the train was bumped and then I was 
going by foot. I started out the first of Sept
ember and I came home the 8th of September 
because by foot we went in night time mos
tly. They were...they were bombing us. They 

were shooting to us...to the civil people. I will 
not tell about this because this was the fi rst 
nightma re what I saw so ma ny 
people killed. I wa s thinki ng this will be  the worsiest  in 

my life but this wasn't  the worsiest. Later 
I found out this wa s not the worsiest. Whe n I 
came home , one day later my sister was 12 y
ears...one day later it was her...her birthday 
and, 12th birthday, the Ge rmans ma rched into ou
r town. It was the 9th of September and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180

then...this was her birthday. And then we 
knew what was happening and the Kristallnacht 
over there. We knew that...we heard...we hear
d that they are burni
ng in the way...in the 
ma rching way, they are burning synagogues. They pushed in Jews into the ghetto with 
this...with the...with th
e synagogue the Jews went to flam
e and we knew that it comes a 
disaster. We  were all scared. My father when
 I...when I told him I a m sc ared, he says, 
"Why you a r e scared?  God is over us." He...he left everyt hing to God. "God will save  us. 

England decl ared war in the 3rd day of the 
war and France, they will defe at German." 

But they...it started in the beginni
ng very slow. It started that 
they caught us in the street. 
They took us to dirty work. They degr aded 
us by slapping in the face, by hitting. This 
was the beginning. Then they started. They...the
y started to catch fr
om the streets to...to 
sent away. My brother one was sent away, but
 it wasn't  far. He was working over there 
some thing for them, and we found out where he is and then after 2 weeks he came 

back...uh...then in...starved, but he came  back. 
And then we were looking only how long 
we will...and then the stores were close
d. Jews shouldn't have a store. The lawyers 
shouldn't practice law, the Jewish lawyers. 
The...the...the doctors, the Jewish doctors, 
shouldn't be doctors. They shouldn't practice. This...for what you live?  So I...I with my 

brother...right now they...bands we had to wear
, white bands with blue
 stars. It is death 
sentence if you...we don't wear. From 6 years 
everybody has to wear. So how we can live 
when we don't have a store?  So I with my brother, we decided with one brother, with 

Hersh, we decided to travel to take food to
 Krakow and to bring back things what 

the...what the farmers need...uh, the public he
re needs. So we...we...we didn't tell our 
parents that we take off afte
r we pass our city, we take off our bands and we go on the 
train to Krakow. We didn't  tell this because th
ey would not let us, but 
we risk our lives to 
ma ke a living for for my...for the family. It
 took...it took a year or so. We  were every 
week going. And then...then we couldn't go a
nymore with the train so...because it was 
very dangerous, so we started Jawisowice 
kitchen and Jawisowice was already a ghetto. 
This was 8 kilome ter from...from our  town. It
 was only... walking distance, it was only 1-
1/2 hour but we went with the, because 
the buses were already confiscated by the 
Germans, so we went with the...with the 
horses and , and it wa s all kind of danger we 
were what we never told the parents eve
n. Because  they wouldn't let us. They were 
starving. They wouldn't let us. And then in 
1942, the beginning of 1942, it was a struggle. 
It was this...I will not tell this everything 
because  it would take til tomorrow. Uh...so in 
1942 in the beginning came  in two Gestapo to our home with guns and they say, "Whose 

the owner of this house?" So my mot her a
nd father...they brought the paper I don't know 
til now for what they brought the paper to si
gn, my mother and father should sign that 
they give this for...for good will to the Germ
an governme nt. So they signed because it 
was guns pointed. They signed. They say, "In 
5 mi nutes you have to go out from this 
house." We  were living little bi
t in the suburbs from the town. Where to go Tyczyn to the 
center of Tyczyn. Okay. To the center of Tycz
yn. We  went to the center of Tyczyn. They 
gave us in..right now, they stayed a nei
ghbor, a goy Pollack stayed and took the keys 
fr om the Germans, so he knew that we will be deported. He probably applied for the 

house. And...and then when we came...we came and we got only one room for the six 

people we got one room, and a kitchen. But we
 were glad that we had the one room. 
My...my unc le had already people put in because
  put in people to every ...who has two, 
three rooms, they matched in...they put in ot
her families in the one room because it was, 
it was lack of rooms.

Q: Who organized that? 

 

A: The Jewish . To ma nage to have the...
 Then we had to register. Then it came  
contributions. Everybody...every Jew has to gi
ve away what...whatever gold he has, he 
has to give away. So my mother took 
off the wedding ring, 
the ear rings, and...and 
everybody had to give. They were Nazis they
 had sent us. Then it came a contribution 
with money. We had to deliver this and 
this much money. If not, ...uh...they will take 10 
people and kill. Uh...so...so we delivered the...the money to the Gestapo, and it was 

enough. The "Kapo delivered and it was enough, 
but they...they counted. You can prove 
to them, they killed off anyway the 10 people. 
Then first we had to give away even my  
when you have to the Germans this. First it wa
s to search and then they gave a order: 
Who has to...who is owed the Pollacks money ha
d to give under the death sentence if he 
will not pa y off, and when the Pollacks owed the Jews, they don't have to pay. So one 

Pollack went to the Gestapo and said over there that my fathe r  owes him 

hundred...hundred dollars here, not hundred , hundred dollars. And this wasn't  true. He 

didn't owe him. Because he wants to black our
...blackma il that we will pay him not to be 
killed. So...so from , the Pres
ident came  running to us, and he says: Nafstali...to my 
father...Nafstali, ...uh...uh...just hide some  pl
ace because the Gestapo is comi ng for you 
because the goy", this goy"" tells over there 
that you owe him and he says that he came  
for you to ask the money...for the mo ney, and you told he sa ys when you will not gi ve 

you the money, I will go to the German...to th
e Ge rman authority, so you told him...he 
says that you told him I have you in my ass 
together with the Germans. And this wasn't  
true. He even didn't come to us. So I was th
inking my father will go with the bear d, with 
this, they will kill him. So I 
told...I told I will go. I went 
to the Gestapo. The whole town 
was looking that I will never come back becau
se one Gestapo on one side and the other 
on the other side with rifles and I in 
the center. Everybody was crying. They were 
thinking they will never see me back. But when
 I came over there, then got that ..that the 
Gestapo didn't  understand Polish, and he told 
what my father told it was a lie, and I 

started to talk to them in German. And I to
ld them, "Listen, you gave an order that we  
have to give back. They blackma il us. He doesn
't  have a penny in his... Go to his home. 

You will see. He has I don't know how ma ny 
children. They are going with bare foots. 
He doesn't ...didn't have money even to...he doesn't  have. He owes us in this store money 

and he never gave us back. And we couldn'
t even make a claim because we don't have 
what to take from hi m. Go to his home. 
You will see how...how he is lying. You'll see 
that he so poor he didn't have rgw hundred dolla
rs is like in this time was 500 "Slotas. So 
I told, he  didn't  have a "slota in hi s pocket. But he knows that...he was thinki ng we will 

pay to save our lives, and I wa
s talking so nice to them, a
nd he was screaming and they 
told him, "Shut up," and...and they let me  go. They believed me . They let me  go. You 

can't  imagine what was happening in the whol
e town when they saw me  alive back. The 
whole town was running to me  and kissing me  
because they were thinki ng I...they will 
never see me back. This was in the beginni
ng everything. Then it was Passover. This was 
the last Passover together. We  sit alr
eady in this one little room. My daddy 
was...was...uh...leading the...the...the , and the fi
rst time I saw my father crying, the tears 
were comi ng over his beard. We  all looked at 
each other. Here we were...had the same  
thing in mi nd. Will we sit together, the next 
Passover together? It wa
s already in  ghetto, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180

and we never sit together. This
 was the last Passover. And 
then...then right after Passover 
came a order: Everybody to the ghetto, to the 
ghetto, to the Sheslow ghetto. It was from 
all towns. It was going...it was going so ma ny. 
It was like a...like a river of people 
earning the way to the ghetto. They were ki
lling. They were...I saw so ma ny people 
killed, and the fa mily was keeping only togeth
er. I didn't see my uncle with the children. I 
didn't see nobody. Only because we were keeping one...because we hired...uh...a... goy 
with...with a wagon, with...with...with horses to pu
t some  belongings over there, to take 
to the ghetto. And I...the first 
thing what I took was the...th
e...the writing wall what we 
made in home for decoration and I painted to 
every panel, I painted a picture. This I took 
with me  because to have privacy if we are 
someplace together with people. We came to 

the ghetto. It was order everybody has to be
 registered. If they found some body on the 
street, they...they...they will kill. So ever
ybody ha d to get a...a room. My uncles over 
there, my mother's brothers and my father's
 sister had already ma ny people so we got a 
room on a attic. It was a iron window on the at
tic and...and we were glad that we have 
already the room. First day my brother went 
out to go to the end for some thing and they 
caught him from the street, the Gestapo, to 
send away. When we heard...they caught only 
this time , only me n, me n and boys, and when we
 found out I...I with 
my mother, with my 
sister, run with a knapsack to bring him, to
 bring him some food a
nd some  clothes. And 
my mother when to the , to th
e head of the...of the Gestapo 
and she begged him, "I want 
to give the last kiss of m
y...to my son and give him this." So he hit her over...over the 
head with a whip and she fell on the paveme
nt. And...and she cried, "I
 want to give the 
last ki ss to my son." And we told her, "H
e will not let you. Mommy, you come home." "I 
will not go away." My brother from far awa
y, he was already standing about 200 or 300 
boys. He saw my mother on the...felling on th
e street and he wants to run and they 
already want him to kill so he couldn't  and 
I saw him fr om far away wiping the tears. And 
they sent him away. And my mother and I onl
y went to...to deliver to
 one solder, "Please 
deliver this to my brother." I 
don't know whether he delivered. 
I even didn't  ask later. In 
the meantime, it started selections. First, th
ey say everybody has to register to work. The 
young people! My mother wasn't  old. She 
was 57. My father was 61. So, they..they 

wasn't ...they wasn't  allowed to register. And I di
dn't want to register. 
I told, "I want to go 
together with you. I will not." So my  mother 
says, "You have a little sister. You have the 
brothers. One brother they sent away. Ma
ybe you will need something to send him or 
some thing. Just...just please be the mother fo
r the children." So sh
e...it was crying this, 
but I had to go because she...she says you bed 
the  of your sister becaus e he r...her...they 
will kill her right away. She is a little girl
. So I...I went. I went with tears and we 
registered to work. As soon we registered 
to work, they ma de a old ghetto and a new 
ghetto. The old ghetto is the people what they ar
e not registered to work, and we were in 
the young ghetto. The ghetto was so crowded, 2, 3 fa milies in one...in one room. The 

rooms were big, but one room, so I was glad 
that I have my dividi
ng wall, that I have 
some  privacy. And then it came....uh...we...we didn'
t see. We  were already divided with 
the parents, and we saw through the window 
already the transports. Every day was a 
transport, thousands of pe
ople. It was 220,000 people registered...uh...Jews registered in 
the ghetto and every...every day was...and we
 saw through the window my uncle. He was 
41, my father's  brother. He was 41. She wa
s 39, his wife. And the 6 children. The two 
were twins. They were from a  but one died 
for a triple, but one died 8 days before it was 
born, but they were already 6 years old. Six chil
dren. They are  already to be sent away. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180

Young people! And they looked up to our wi
ndow. They were crying and we couldn't go 
down. We  were crying. And they were se
nt away. Every...every child had one...one 
knapsack, the 6 years old. And then they 
saw they are taking away on the truck the 
knapsacks, so my aunt...my aunt took quick out
 fr om the knapsack one dress more to put 
on the children to have to change because sh
e saw that they taking 
away. After they left  
from this , I saw the Polish...the Polish pe
ople taking apart from the...from the truck, the 
things and taking for themselves, putting 
in the pockets and laughing and the Polish 
police. We  saw this that...that even when 
they take with them, they don't have nothing 

from this. And so...and it was heartbreaking 
to see my....... (e nd of tape 1, side A)...to our 
home . We  lived in one town. And then...then 
we...we were taken every day to work. I, 
with my sister, my brother, and we didn't know
 nothing about the other brother. Where he 
was sent. Then it came  time that they...that we 
heared that my ...that the street my parents 
where they are, they are going away. They 
are sent..they will be 
sent away. And every 
day when we went from work, we tried to 
exchange with the Poles on the way because  a 
Gestapo was in the front and a Gestapo in
 the back, but...but we took out things to 
exchange for bread for some thing to bring to 
the ghetto because they didn't give us food. 
But we had to ma nage by ourself. So, and I 
smuggled into my pare
nts some...some food, 
and then when I heared that they are going to 
send my parents, I went....I told my sister 
you go. You go to work and when they call
...when they call you, you will answer and 
when they will call my name
, you will answer too because 
it was 200 girls going to the 
same  place to work. So..so she went and I...I wi
ll try to...I was so naive. I was think I will 
try to save my parents. And 
I went...I wouldn't...I said goodb
ye to my...to my mother and 
she says...she says to me, "Please don't cry. I ma de...I made a promise to God that I will 

not one tear shed by saying goodbye because
...because in the...ma ybe...maybe he will 

save my children. And be brave." And I wrote about this a poem also because about 

everythi ng I wrote later poems. My father fell
 in my arms, and then my mother was taken 
away. My father fell in my arms . He was cr
ying. And the...the...the SS me n started to hit 
him over the head and he says,  this what 
I saw, the last of my father. A young SS ma n 
hitting him over the head and chasing him to 
the . And then later I went to the  and I 
saw...I didn't see them. They probabl
y saw me  because I was between the 

Germans...between...and I went to one Gest
apo. I kissed him in the hand, and I told, 
"Save my pa rents. We  are working all and we will keep my parents." And it was so silly. 

And he says, "If you don't go down from this place, from this, I will ki ll you and your 

parents in your eyes." So I was thinking I wi
ll...so I went down. I went away because I 
was thinking...I didn't know they are sent to
 the gas chambers. I was thinking they are 
sent to work some  place. So this was the last
 what I saw my father and mother. And then 
I went again next day to wo
rk. And we were working and in the meantime it came ...it 
came...uh...uh. one, some body came from this place where my  brother was over there 

sent away and he is working on the..
.on the..uh...on the...this means on the...on the 
airport. He is working over there for the Germans in the other town, from "Jowiszowice 

was ma ybe about 20 kilome ters. So I...I de
cided I will go and bring him some thing...food. 

I will take off my band and I will smuggle myself out and I will...and I will go over there 

and I will dress myself nice. I will dress myself 
in a hat, in a..in a nice dress, and I will go 
like a...a...like not a Jew over there, and I 
will bring...so my brother says, Maybe I will 
see the last time  my brot her. I want to go 
too." So I told him,  ""Hinue" I called him 
"Hinue, it wa s his name  Hersh. "Hinue they 
will recognize that you are Jew. He says,

"No. I will dr ess myself nice, and I...and I wi
ll go with you." I...We  looked like it. I had 
black eyes and I had green eyes and this 
saved me not one time. And he had...but we 
looked like, but he says I w
ill go. So we went. But wherever I went to a st or e to buy 
something for my brother, to bring him over ther
e, they didn't  want sell us so I told to 

Hinue, "They recognize that we are Jewish. 
They don't want to sell us, the fools, 
nothing." Then it went the with
 Gestapo and the...the coachma n was a Pollack and he told 
him some thing and I told to Hinue, "You know, 
he told...he told them some thing and they 
looked back. This was Gestapo with helmet
s. They...uh...He told that we are Jews. We 
were without bands, nice dress. So he says, "L
et's  go in this little street." And we hear 
behind us with the rifles and this means Jew  
Stay still. So we came back to them and I 
started to talk Polish. I ma de believe that I don't understand Ge rman because the Pollacks 

didn't understand and I told, "Listen. They...they 
take us for Jews. We  are not Jews." So 
he says, "You are not Jewish, but
 he is Jewish." So I told, 
"He is my brother. If he's 
Jewish, I'm Jewish, but he's  not. He's not
 Jewish. They opened my pocke tbook. In my 
pocketbook, I had a powder...a powder case. U
nder the powder case I had my father and 
mother with a beard and my mother in a...in 
a wig because this was from the "Meldacot, 
from the German "Meldacot. I kept this ever
ywhere with me . I kept this with me . And 
they opened the powder, I was thinking that's 
it. They will not...they will see my father 
and mother. They will know that I am not Jewish...that I am Jewish. But they opened so 

the powder covered and they didn't see. I save
d my brother because then I...I...they told 

they will look in his pants because in Po
land, the Polish people weren't circumcised and 
he was circumcised and I heared in German, 
they say they were l
ooking in his pants and 
they pushed and I didn't want to go away from hi m. So they pushed me . I fell in the...in 

the dust...and the hat fell down and I...and I starte
d to scream to them in Polish, and I told 
how...how a nimals you are, you Germans. I was 
thinking you are educated people so you 
first come in...in and see or I am Jewish, come to
 this village, I told some  village what is 
very far. And come  to...to my village and you 
will see that I am Polish. And I saved with 
my screaming at them so fresh. I saved the life 
of my brother. I later 
was very sorry that I 
saved his life because he died in a very awfu
l way later. And I..I...and I and this time , my 
brother was very angry at me . He says, 
"Why you saved my life?  Why you didn't go?  
You left over there a sister alone, andyou...you...you could be killed tonight." So I told 

him but I saved your life. He says, "One time, 
" , but we have to reme mbe r  over there is a 
sister and when one of us get killed, the other 
has...some of us  has to
 survive to tell this 
story. This...but he didn't go anymore, because over ther e was a  and I was...went alone. I 

went alone and I teared out...from the  field,I teared out some  carrots to bring him and 

some money and some...some clothes. When I 
came  over there and I saw him, he was not 
the same  brother. He was so thin with 
bare foot and then when...when...the...the...the 
officer what he took care of the...he was a Je
w and I went to him to please let me  see my 
brother. I am Jewish, but I want
 to see him. So he says, "O
kay. Go. Go here in the...in 
the...in this little hill and hi
de and see him, but you don't have time more than 5 mi nutes." 
We fell in each other's arms and he knew alr
eady that my parents were sent away. That 
our parents were sent 
away. We  cried. I gave him the carro
ts. He ate. He says, "I am like 
an animal. You see with...with th
e dirt I eat because we eat he
re grass. " He...so he says, 
"I'm...I'm now like a animal eating without 
washing. I am so hungry." And it was only 5 
mi nutes we saw each other. We  only cried. We  didn't have time  even...we couldn't bring 

out a word. Then I go...went back and me t with
 my brother because my brother hi d over 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180

there...the other brother hi
d over there and waited for me . And we came ba ck to the 
ghetto. And that time they send that brother...
the brother didn't want to know where they 
will send him. The sent him back. I wrote about 
this in the...I will not repeat this. They 
sent him back to the ghetto and I wrote in 
the diary. I have everything written down. And 
then in awhile, they sent him also away 
from over there to the Treblinka. And he was 
about 2 months he was in the ghetto worki
ng, and we were working othe r places. From 
the 220,000 Jews was left by the end only 2,000. 
It was going transports every day. We 
were beaten up. We  were...we were always by 
the work. One time  the , he...he hit only 
girls...girls, not boys, only girl
s. And one time I was packed with things to take out to 
change for...for food, and I heard the  is ove
r there, so I went back quick to throw 
down...in the ghetto, to throw down the things be
cause I knew he is...the...is very strict 
over there....to throw down. We  ca me back. 
He...Well,  he says, 
Where you go?" I told, 
"To my group. Here is my group." He gave 
me  with the...with the whip over the...over 
the face and...and...and he said, "Stay. Stay he
re with your sister."  So we stand...and we 
knew we will get 25 because he gave 25 and in Europe nobody was wearing pants. No 
girl was wearing pants, only skirts. And he
 picks up the skirts and on the...on the...on the 
silky panties he gives 25 with the whip. Wh
en he gave me  the 25 I went to him and 
begged him not to hit my sister . She is only 14 
years old. She will not be able to take it, 
the 25. I was biting my...my lips not to scream, not to give  him the satisfaction when he 

was hitting me , but then I went to him and 
I kissed his hand and I begged him, "Hit me  
once more and don't hit my sister." But they 
kept me  by the wall and they started to hit 
my sister. Then I was screaming to get off my
 sister, but my s i ster didn't get 25 because 
every whip she was so young, a child 14 years, every whip was with blood. So he gave 

her...and she...she told me  just last w
eek, she had only six. I didn't know how ma ny, 
but..but she had only six times. But we couldn'
t sit a long time later. And she...she was 
laying always, when she went in bed, she was laying on the...on the belly. But the next 
day, we had to go...we had to go off anyway to 
work, so we went to work every day. And 
by the work we were hit too. One time a  hit 
me . Good I had a coat because it was winter. 

So he hit me  with his cane, so he broke on me  the cane in few...in few pieces. And...and 

then he called me  to the office and he says
, "Tomorrow you will have to bring me other 
cane because  I broke the cane. If notI will...I will kill you tomorrow." So the 

whole...when I came back to the ghetto, th
e whole ghetto was looking the cellars and 
the...for a cane to bring me  the cane and... because...and they brought me  about 10 canes. 

So beautiful, some  of them were silver things
 what the people left what they were sent 
away..to give  him and I gave him the whole thing...10 canes because he br oke on me  the 

cane. Such things! They degraded us so, I 
was not caring anymore, but I promised my 
mother that I will take care the 
rest  of my fa mily so I...I di
dn't  care to be killed already. 
Then... then my brother, my last brother, 
was sent away. And this brother...and this 
brother what I saved his life, he came one tim
e home and he s a ys, "Mina, I heard...I heard 
that they will go to...to liquidate woma n in 
ghettos. I will not let myself anymore tear 
apart. That's it. We  are enough teared apart.
 We  will run away, but I have to look for you 
for a place because with girls I can't  run wit
hout a place. So he went out. He took 2 weeks 
til he  came back. I was thinking they killed him already because he took off the band and 

everything and he went to look for a...he
 with his boyfriend. They were both 
Yeshivas...Yeshiva boys, but in this time, they didn't wear already the , nothing. They 

went and they found a place so we...we took...we... the day what we had to go away

to...we were to meet outside, uh..outside ""Jawi szowice, we told him one this place we  
will meet. So we stood first my sister from the...from the...when we went from work, then 

I, and my br other from other pl ace, we 
me t over there...uh...in...in this place where we  
told we will meet and we  we
nt night time  over there. This
 was near Tyczyn. This me ans 
Tyczyn was our town, and where they found the place, it was in a village, but it was...by 

our...more walking distance from our town fr
om Jawiszowice, about 3 hours walking. 
They found it a pl ace by a...by a goy what he five children and they were very poor. And 

this time  wa sn't ...wasn't law that if some body 
keeps Jews, they get killed together with 
the Jews, but we promised him to give hi
m every month nice money. They ma de with 
him arrangements and for the food what he 
will give us, they...uh...knew he will pay him 
whatever he spends. So we...uh...but they were in
 the other pl ace, the 2 boys. We  were in 
one place, but they were waiting til they will 
ma ke for us a bunker. They ma de for us a 
bunker. They ma de for us a bunker from the stable to go down on a ladder. How they 

were working, you can't  imagine to take out so much ground from over there. The stable 

was outside. The...the...uh...the bunk
er was outside, but the walk
ing in was to the stable 
inside. So it was a bunker what we coul
dn't...uh...uh...walk straight only put down, and 
they ma de a bench over there to be able to sit a whole day and for night time when the 

children will go to sleep, they will
 let us out to the stable to
 sleep. And the stable was...I 
wrote about this too a poem and in the diar
y too...and my brother 
and this boy were an 
hour walking distance through the forest. When they...they had the other pl ace. When 

they came to visit us once a month I told them don't go. You can be caught. He says 

Germans are not here. And we go only when it is
 not the moonlight. It
 is...when it is the 
dark light we  go through the...nobody will find us. They came to us three times. The third 

time they were caught by the Poles, by 19 Po
les. And they beat them up so badly. My 
brother, they cut...they cut the throat, but they
 di dn't  kill him... only little he  was cut. And 
the beat him so up that he  will bl ack blue old...old. And I know they caught him only 5 
mi nutes from us...not 5 mi nutes...5 mi nutes from 
us they started to chase them the two 
boys, but they run in the opposite way because 
they didn't want bring them to our place 
so they were caught only...only 10 mi nutes fr
om us. The boy, the boyfriend of...of my...of 
my brother, he...he'll...they...t
hey throwed out his eye...his eye was hanging over the fa ce 
and they were chained to take to the Ge
stapo. And the Gestapo they...later I found out, 
that on the Gestapo, the Poles, the 19 Poles, 
told that they have 
some  place two sisters 
because they knew us because they came to 
our store to town...to the town from the  
villages. They knew that my brother has two sist
ers. Over there, they were tortured to...by 
the Gestapo, to say where the si ster s are. Sure
 they will not tell because we are alive. And 

then they...they were token...tak
e to be killed. To tell you ab
out the...the bunker, we didn't 
have air to. It was lack of oxygen. We  had 
a carbide lamp, but a little light over there 
couldn't light  nothing. Not...not a candle, because it was not oxygen enough. Only the 

carbide. They goy what he kept us. They ar
e such anti-semitic goy, but they were very 
religion goys. They...they...uh...they said they ch
arged us so much mone y and they gave 
us so little food. And my sister one time  
she...she got fever. Two weeks she couldn't 
recognize me even. She was talking from 
the fever and we were under the ground in 
this...in this bunker and from night time  we we
nt down up to the stable to sleep and over 
there was a cow...a cow and a...and a goat and 
a...and chickens and rabbits and we were 
sleeping on a bundle of straw. When the children
 went to bed and they will not know that 
we are over there. He was...was so awful to 
us. this goy. He was starving us, and he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180

telling us, "You ate enough. When I came toyour store the...the chickens and just 
everything, the smell that came Friday, the w
ith this everything, this smelled so nice. 
Now you wi ll little bit starve. You will be  hum
ans. We knew that he can kill us. Nobody 
will know even. So we told him because he was a very religion Christian, we told him 

that after the war we will change to Christia
nity. And we were thinking future Christians 
he will not kill. He is a religion. They went
 every Sunday. They went to the church. Once 
a month he went to...to confession. But the c
onfession in teaching the...the...the church 
wasn't  teaching. The...the  priest wasn't  t
eaching. He told them he has two...two...two 

girls, Jewish girls that he
 asked who are they. Glucksma n. They will convert to...because 
we were Glucksma n fr om home . They will c
onvert to Christ ianity. He knew that my 

father's daughters will never change to Christ
ianity. So he told him so. When you ma ke  a 
crime, you will be forgiven. But if you five innocent plans will go from this world, you 

will be always in Hell burning. We  didn't know 
what he told him, but when he came from 
this confession, we saw he is very angry a
nd "Go to . I don't want you Jews and this and 
this." I told him, "Listen, we didn't come  
to you with a gun to take us. We don't have 
where to go. Ghetto is already liquidated 
because the ghetto was few...fe w weeks later 
when we are run away, ghetto was liquidate
d. They ma ke one grave and the 2,000 were 
killed over there in...in this
 grave and the the goy came,this goy came and he said the 
grave is moving up and down three days alr
eady because it was probably over there Jews 
already what...what they were st
ill alive there buried. And just 
4 weeks later, my father's 
cousin, 32 years old and his wife
 and children, 3 or 4, this I 
don't re me mb er, were caught 
by the...by the Poles to they were hiding. They even didn't go. I didn't know that they 

didn't go in the ghetto because it was such a mi shma sh in this ghetto. Who...who...only 

the nearest fa mily, you knew where they are. And this was my father's cousin. So, 

they...they caught him. They hit him and the lit
tle girl said to the mother...she was 8 years 
old...because  they got ma rried very young. So sh
e says to the mother, "Don't cry. We  will 
go. We will not suffer anymore in this hole. We
 will go to Heaven when they kill us." So 
the goy" came home to me  and he said, "T
hey will not go to Heaven. They are Je ws. 

They are not Christians. They will go to Hell,
 not to Heaven." They were laughing at this, 
but the little girl told...she...she was 
the comforting the father and mother. 
 

Q: Okay. You can go back to the story 
now. You said...you were saying you thought you 
would go out to be kill
ed with your brother. 
 

A: When he was...they were taken to de
ath, I knew everything. It is now on?  I knew 
everythi ng what is going on because  they came every mi nute to tell us what is going on 

with my brother. And...and we want to go. My sister says. "Let's go. Let's  go and be 

killed here. Anyway we will not 
live. Let's be killed together with them." So I told her, 
"Sabina", You know what they will do us?  We  
are girls. They will rape us and they 
will...and they will di rty us up and then they wi
ll take us to the...to the Germans to be 
killed." But we were going out from our mi nds
. I was thinking some thing we have to do 
to occupy...the whole time  when we  were 
over there, I taught her everything what I 
reme mbered because she had only 6...6 public 
schools finish, and then she couldn't go 
anymore because the war started. She was 12. So I taught her everythi ng by me mory 

what I remember...what I reme mbered and I te
ll her stories and I told her...I ma ke up 
stories to tell her to occupy her. She wa
s sick 2 weeks and she didn't...couldn't...she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180  
11 
 
couldn't recognize me  and I couldn't even ta
ke a doctor...nothing... because we were...so 
I...like here, it's aspirin. Over there, it was ot
her name  of this. I sent him for the aspirin, 
and I begged him, "Make some thing warm for her. Some thing because they cooked for us 
potatoes, and they gave us for a whole day 
over there to the whole 
over there the potatoes 
and...uh...and...uh...she couldn't swallow this. She was sick. So one time I went...when we 

were up in the..in the...so I was thinking 
I have to... meat...we didn't have the whole 
time...they were starving us. We paid much mo
ney, and they were starving us. So I told 
her, "Sabina, I have something to do. Some th
ing to give you." She said, "I can't  swallow. 
I can't  swallow the potatoes." And I was think 
she will di e over ther e. I went upstairs and 
they were chickens and chickens...little chic
kens. So I was thinking, I will kill one chick. 
One chick for her. So I...I...I never killed nothing in my life, so I took a stone and I...and I 

hit the chicken over the head a
nd I killed the chicken and I we
nt in the...in the bunker and 
I over there, I ma de from...from toot
h no...uh...polish...polish...shoe polish, from...from 
the deck, I ma de with a virus...and I cleaned 
up the kitchen..the chicken. I cleaned up the 
chicken. I cleaned up the bones and I buried 
over there inside in the ground and over 
there we had always wore it some times drippe d from the walls. It dripped from this, so 

we had always wore this. So I cleaned this
 up, and I cut up little pi eces and I put over ... I 
put little pieces in lit
tle water. It was so hygiene. Don't 
ask. And I ma de this for her. Then 
she started to fight with me . I f you will not eat, 
I will not eat. So I told 
her, Sabina, I ate..I 

ate the potatoes. I couldn't  tell her that I w
ouldn't be able to take this in my mouth 
because I killed this. It was...my hands and f
eet were shaking when I killed this chicken. 
So...but I had to save her life some how. So I 
ma de her the whole chic
ken. I cut up in little 
pieces and I made it over the carbide lamp 
so to give her some thing. And...uh...this and 
one time...one time, she passed out because we didn't have air to breath. So metimes we 

had "hair black, hair black even  from lack 
of oxygen so I saw she is passing out because 
when he..when he...when we went to the..uh...t
o the bunker, it was a little thing to pull 
through, a little opening, and he put
 on this dirt on a little dirt
 and then a big stone and I 
saw that she will pass out when I don't  get some  a i r in. So I we nt...I went...I went on the 

ladder. I coul dn't pick up my hand because it
 was very narrow to go in. I we nt on the 

ladder and with my hea d. I don't know how I 
did...the stone was ma ybe by 1 yard big and 
by a half yard. How I did this I don't know. I don't know til now. When...when...in..uh.. I 

pulled off the stone and I came for he r. I dr
agged her over the ladder, up to the and I 
closed quick the door from the...from the stable because there were layi ng children 

around back and forth in the hallway. And I dragged her up to get some  air. She came  to 

herself. And he came in. He saw the door is closed so he knocked on the door. And he 

saw us. How you went out?  Who he lped you to ta
ke off the stone?  So I told him, "Jesus 
helped us. Don't you know?  Jesus helped us. He...he was sorry we didn't have with what 

to breath. He was sorry. He helped us. He told us go out." This was such a primitive goy. 

He believed in this, you know. He believed th
at it is impossible a human-being should be 
able to pick this up alone. So he..he..uh...he 
was very dumb. He didn't know how to write 
and read. When he came from this concentr
ation, I saw that this
 taught him some thing 
and this also small town. He knew my father 
and Saturday he went 
with that  with the 
garden with the  to the synagogue with b
eard and . He knew. He saw him going to the 
synagogue. So...so he knew that hi
s daughter will never...that
 we fool him only. So he 
told him this, but he didn't  tell me  what he 
told the...I knew that some thing he felt. And 

understanding that, you see, understanding that 
the Russians went back and forth with 6 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180  
12 
 
months to fight, so back and forth they moved back, and they started to come  nearer. And 
when they started to come nearer, he starte
d to be good with us. So I told...and I knew it 
was comi ng the second time  the...soon he will go 
to other confession. It is almost...almost 
a month. So I told him, "Tell me the trut
h. What priest told you. I know you came very 

hungry from the priest, from the confession. He 
told me  what  I want and he didn't ma ke 
up these words because he  wouldn't know how to compare his children to fi ve innocent 

plants. He wouldn't be able this to...to compare so I knew this not his words. He told 

me ...I with my sister looked at us..at 
each each other and we ..we thought...how it is 
possible he told them to kill. He will go the second time. He will see he doesn't 

understand that crime wi ll be forgiven and you five innocent...uh...will go from this 

world because of these two Jewish girls, he
 will be always in Hell. He will go second 
time. He will tell him he will 
see that he didn't understand. So
 I told hi m listen I will tell 
you...he bought us...uh...the...uh...Jesus. We  were waiting this Jesus. He bought us this. 

We had to pay him for t his but we were worry
ing. We  didn't  have a choice. So he...I told 
him...Listen go to other pr iest , to the other 
confession. We will see th
ey are both sons of 
God...the both...every...every...everyone is a s
on of God. So go...go to other...to other 
town. Over there I knew they don't...the priest
 at least doesn't  know my father because it 
was the other town. And it was the same  direc
tion. He listened to me . He went and he 
brought us back rosaries and books and I...we 
had to pay for this...and..the...the... priest 
will come  to convert us right now after 
the war. Now he can come  and  God but 
the..the...right now after the war 
he will come  to convert us. Okay. I didn't  believe that we 
will live until after the war. But after my brot
her died...after they ki
lled him, I saw that 
we will go out from our mi nd so I told myself
, we have some thing...I ha ve some thing to 
occupy my s i ster. I have some thing to do. So I told him to buy copy books. He bought the 

copy books and we started to write a diary. That
's why I have a diary. We  were under this 
ground 20 and a half mo nths, hiding, in terribl e 
conditions. I had this 
in the diary written 
down. We  had to work too. Some times they gave us work and we had to work. But we 

made from our old things what 
we had hidden..old things, we ma de 
from...from...uh...pillow cases for this we made some  scarves and I told him that I want  

dye. For what?  I want to ma ke 
myself some dresses, me a
nd my sister. So he..he says, 
"Who sees you." But we had always, you see, 
in Europe, you didn't wear cotton dresses. 
You wear all silk or wool and when we 
go down from the ladder, up and down, it tears 
the dresses. It was delicate. It tears. So 
we had to have some thing from...fr om cotton. 
So...from sheets, we made something so I to
ld him we havse to ma ke mys e lf...ourself, 

two dresses, cotton dresses. So I..I...I to
ld him...we sewed this by hand with machine 
stitches but by hand, so we told him to bri
ng us dye. So he says, "What you need dye?  
Who will see you?" But we were like for our
self buy...buy us 10 package this dye. I ga ve 
him money. He bought. So I told, "I don't like this color. Buy me  red." He bought me  red. 

I had put toge ther few...few colors so I star
ted to ma ke for sale because I saw the mone y 
will go soon out. We  didn't  have a fortune. We
 have to do some thing. We started to ma ke 

skirts, " skirts. No, the wear to the churches
, they wear over scarves, brown scarves. We 
started to make from "dommers. It was like a 
design. We  started to ma ke scarves to sale. 
We started to ma ke all kind of things for him 
to s a le and we...we dyed this. Over there in 
the...in the bunker camp because we had enough water over there. We  some ti me s had to 

take off some buckets of water from over 
there because it would...it would cover us the 
water. So...so...we...we...we couldn't dry this in 
this stable. We couldn't dry this in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180  
13 
 
bunker because it will never dry. We  dried this 
under us when we went to sleep...under us 
on the straw with our bodies. This wa s our 
life for 20 and a half months. To tell you 
the...the...that deaths...how ma ny 
de aths I saw in the...in the...in the ghetto in my eyes 
killed, how they teared out children fr om 
the mot her's hand and they throwed to the 
German she pherds, how the... This was in the gh
etto before... before we went over to . It 
was by ten or  ma ybe mor e  in the...in the   w
ith little , they were some place in a barrack. 
They were taken every day to work. We were
 then working on the railroad tracks because 
the railroad was bombed that we had to put ne
w railroad tracks and this boys had to pick 
up this. It was terrible. There were already 
orphans because pa rents were already sended 

away. They were hungry. And one fe ll and the 
Gestapo kicked him betwe e n the feet. And 
I went to him and I want to give him my...
my lunch what I took with me . He says, "I 
don't want. I want my mommy, my daddy." And 
I hurt so much. He hit me. It hurt so 
much. He kicked me . I don't know what they did to him. He c ouldn't stand up. In a while 

his voice disappeared. Probably sent  away 
or killed, I don't know. They were some place 
in the barrack. It was a time when they want
 to barrack us, our group. Whe n we were in 

the ghetto, in the barrack, my brother's group 
we ran away from the ghetto. We  run away. 
We didn't want to be in the barracks, barra
cked. We run away, and then later we came 

back because we didn't have a place to be.It was terrible. We  looked everyday the dead 

in the eyes. I can't  tell you everythi ng 
what was going on because it would take til 
tomorrow. But I...I tell you only fragme nts fr
om t his. It was a little
 boy 9 years old. In a 
ghetto she was 12 years old. They were left al
one. They were working together with us. 
And it was...it was...uh... before we ran away. 
It was the...the...one time the little boy 
worked with us. We  had to work very fast. I had to work for my... because my sister was 

also not so strong. She was 14 then already, 
but 14 years she was looking like 9 years. 
And she couldn't work so hard...so I had so fa
st, so I had to quick for her and quick for 
me  for her not to be beaten up. This boy was 
beaten so much by them and he called his 
sister, "Blanca. Blanca. Save me ." It 
was terrible things what I saw. And...and 
then...then... uh...he was beaten up, but then "B
lanca went to the "R
eichmaster, and she 
asked him, "Please let my brother go. Don't 
hit him. Hit me ." It was such a devotion. 
Everybody would give life for the other pe
rson. And then it was...uh...it was also, we 
were working by the, you know, when the...when you take rolling thing, what they put in 

clay, and this to pick up with wet clay...
it was such a...it break down down the person. 
And we had to work this. For ma ny, i t  was di
fficult. When you roll this already there's a 
cable to pick this up, and I had to pick up fo
r my sister and for me
 and when we went 
over there it was the builders. They were 
Pollacks. And they say, "Quick work you...they 
called us awful name ...quick work anyway you go 
from mor ning late to the...to the ovens. 
I didn't believe that they are putting in
 the ovens people. I was thinking the 
antiªSemi nites, they called us" name s, such 
low name s, and work quicker quicker. Or one 
time it was , , so we brought the me n what 
he looked after...over us, we brought him a 
trench...a beautiful trench coat, and we gave 
him to let us little bit early home  on Yom 
Kippur on..in Russishooner. You know what he 
did. Because he took the trench coat, but 
because he knew that we want to go early, 
he ke pt us a whole day, a whole night, and a 

whole day. We had to work 36 hours, 36 hours because...because we gave ...gave...he 

knew that...and it was a Ukranian. He was Uk
ranian. Also they were wearing black 
things. How ma ny times  we were beaten up. 
One time...one time ...this was before we run 
away from the ghetto, I went out with my
 sister and we...we went... uh...and my brother

was still over there, and he had to give us 
nighttime , he will come  under the ghetto and he 
will give us packages to take out because we 
planned to run away. To take out to hi d over 
there, to one..un....to one Polish family. They 
were very good with us. Before the war 
they were...they were teachers. They came 
to our store to buy. So we ca me  under the 
ghetto...it came  two, three...yal,
 three...uh...no, it was...this...uh...s
oldiers, and they say, 
"What you are doing here under the ghetto?" A
nd they search us and I had a pound butter 
to give to my brother, and I say I came to 
sell butter to the Jews. He says...what...when he 
is in our window was going out, it was big wa
ll, but our window from the ghetto went out 

to the Irish side, you know. And...and I saw 
my brothersitting over 
there withthis boy, 
sitting over there, and they say, "What you have 
to come ? "  I told he had to come  here 10 
o'clock at night to buy for us. So he says, 
"When they will not come, you will be killed. 
So we know that you are a liar." So I told, "Yes. He will come. He told he will buy from 

us. He went to work. He told he will buy from
 us." So...so he says, "Not in this window. 
Maybe this Je w will buy from you." And I knew...my brother will come  out because  he  

will expect that we are knocking, so" I told, 
"I don't know this Jew. How I knock to this 
window. I don't know this Jew." So he knocked. 
I saw my br other through the gate. I saw 
he is comi ng out. So I started to scream Po
lish to him, "I don't  know this Jew. What you 
want from me. I don't  know this Jew." So I 
want my brother to know not to come  to 
the...to hear my voice, that we are in trouble, 
that he will not come to the gate because he 

will be right now killed. So...so he knew already 
that we are in trouble. In the meantime, 
he says, "Oh, you spoiled everythi ng." He gave me  a slap in face. "You spoiled 

everythi ng because you are screaming. He would come  here and buy this. You are 

screaming. You spoiled everything." So..I..I 
told, "But I don't know this Jew." And I 

screamed again for him good to hear not to 
come  to the gate. Then I hearrf, they...we 
make believe we don't understand German, but 
I hearded, they told they will take us 

some  place in a...in a...in a...a empty house and 
they will rape us. O
h, my God! So I...I 
told...I...it wa s a older German between them
. It was two young German and one older. I 
went to him and I...and I start to cry and 
I say, "Let us go. My mo mmy will...will over 
there think it's so late. Please let us go. Let us go because my mommy will over there 

worry. My mommy and daddy...my 
mommy and daddy was already in the gas chambers, 
but I told this because we made believe that we are Christians. So he said...so the 

older...the older German some how had because 
I started to cry, because I was thinking...I 
knew what they are going to do to us. He
 had some ...they are thinking that we are 
Christians. He had some this, a
nd he started to talk with th
em quiet and they let us go. 
First they put a revolver to us. They will ki
ll us because the Je w didn't show up and this. 
And we were thinking it better to be killed
 than raped. And then..then...they let us go. 
The let us go. My God. We didn't...couldn't 
believe they will let us go. So how ma ny 
times I had a revolver to my...to 
my heart with my sister. It was about three, four times 
already. And...and some how... and I always, when 
they had the revolver, I told  always 
my mo mmy, , save us. Always my mommy I 
called. I don't know. I never called and this 
time, it was times that I didn't believe in 
God. It was times that
 I was thinking it is 
impossible that it can be a God and can see 
this everything what happened to us and not 
to do some thing about. And the Germans had on the buckles, they had written. This 

means, "God is with them." You know! So I 
was thinking maybe they are right. God is 
with them, not with us. And...and...uh... so... so 
I was..the...I was thinking...someti mes I 
was not believing. Some times...oh...when I called  save us in Jewish, alwa ys to my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180

mother, in my mi nd I was talking only Jewish
. That's  why I wrote when I wrote that 
poem to my mother, I was always writing Je
wish, not Polish. The...t
he...the diary I was 
writing in Polish, but..but..when I talked to my
 parents through this, I write...wrote also 
the poem in Polish...in Yi ddish. So I told  sa
ve us. And some how we were saved. So..I 
still...I again believe my mother is wa tc
hing us. And it was time s that it was like a 
mi racle happened that I started again to beli
eve. But it was times that I were...I was not 
believi ng, not believing in nothing. How we we
r e  liberated, now I will tell you. We  were 
20 and a half months in this hell over there,
 in this hole. They 
wre terr ible. We made 
believe that we have a gun so them to be 
a little bit scared. Th
ey never we nt to bunker 
because they were scared that it will cav
e in. And one time it... my brother was still 
alive...it started to cave in. Because over 
us was like...like two yards of...of ground, and it 
was 2 weeks before my hus...my brot her was killed. It started to cave in 
and...and...uh...but then my brother and this 
boy, they support us with wood...with wood 
and later night time...we didn't go in the mo
rning to the bunker because it would not be 
safe. And this was only 2 weeks before they 
were killed. They were working so hard. 

They save...they save us, but they went to de
ath only because of us. Because when they 
wouldn't come  to visit us, they wouldn't be
 caught and they wouldn't be killed. But 
because of us, and I begged him, "Don't  go."
 I was happy to see... to see them. But I was 
scared that they will be...every time when 
they left , I was only listening what the  will 
bring and they wasn't  caught. And they were
 caught. The third time when they came they 

were caught...caught. So they were only 3 
months hiding and they were caught. And so 
we started the diary to write. And my sister 
not one time told me , "I want...I wish...I wi sh 
the Germans would find us and kills us alre
ady. For what we live?" " February, we will 
not live through.  And some ti me s she throwed th
e...the... diary, and she said, "For what I 

am writing. What they will use. They will ki
ll us. We will...we will never be  free from 
here. They will kill us. What th
ey will do with this? They will use this for toilet paper." 
But I encouraged her again because  I knew 
when not we will get crazy. One time... (end 
of tape 2, side A)  Beginning of Tape 2, Si
de B.  You know the Germans are running, and 
they are burning houses. You want to go to beca
use we are going away to the forest. You 
want to go with us. And I was scared because
 you see I didn't  know the Poles over there, 
the farmers. But they knew us because they 
came to this stor e. And they..they...they knew 
us, but we didn't know them because we were not
 staying in this stor e. So I was scared. 
We were scared to go out, but...but...uh...they 
told they will...they will burn the houses 
when they are running away. So we went. We  
put on scarves for them not  to see us, and 
we...we went. It was dark. It was in the fore
st". And we were over there about 2 hours. 
We heared the Germans talking and running. And 
then we went back over there in the...in 
the stable. One time we saw that he doesn't cover us because right now in the morning he 

covered us. Over there we had to go in th
e...in the bunker and he covered us. And he 
doesn't  cover us. It is already day time. 
I hear the children ru
nning over there on the 
hallway and I thought: What is it?  We  looke
d out. In the stable was a small window 
ma ybe by..by 8 inches...a small window and I lo
oked. From far away I saw...I saw over 
there a soldier, and I sa w there's another Ge
rman. Must be Russians. Russians must be 
here already. And he doesn't  tell us because he wa nts to convert us. So...uh...went to 

the...to the crack from the door, you know, 
and he came out from the...we  saw him 

comi ng out from his room. We  knoc ked on the d
oor and we told him...told him, " Why 
don't you cover us?  It's  day light." So he
 says...he says, "What do you..uh..what is so..." 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180  
16 
 
"Why you didn't tell us the Russians are here." So he says, "So what. So what. So go. 
You want to go." So I told, "I will not go 
because I will not put you in danger." Because 

the...uh...the Russians...the Germans can come  
back and the Poles will know where we 
were, and you're fine innocent...innocent plans 
will go from this world because of us so I 
don't want to put you in danger. And really
 I woul dn't go out because I didn't know...I  
came over there in night time. I never was over th
ere before the war. It wa s not in town. It 
was no village. I wouldn't  know whe r e to go. 
In the day time, when I go, the Pollacks will 
kill...kill us off anyway. They
 killed after the war. They
 killed ma ny Jews with nobody 
knows where. So I ma de  him so scared that he put us..."So what you want to do. How 

you want to go out? "  So I told him, "Listen, pu
t us for the day time over there in he called 

this in the hole. Put us in the hole. The bunke
r he called hole. Put us in the hole for the 
day time. In night time , take...take...uh...the wagon with the horses, put full straw on this 

and we will go under this straw and you will uncover us when you see the Russian Army. 

So he says...he says, "Okay." He got very 
scared. So in night ti
me , he did so. We ...we 
went under the straw...in the...in the...on the 
wagon with full straw. He took us back and 
we heard still in Jawiszowice fighting because we  heared the...uh...how they fight 

Germans wi th the...with the...with the Russian
s. And I...he went back over there to the 
Russian Army. Over there in 
this town, I knew I have a te
acher what she taught me  and 
she was not Jewish, but she taught me when...w
hen I was in...in public school. So I told, 
"Take us to . We  went over there and she 
said, "Oh Mina, how you 
look! My God, when 
your father and mother sees you...because we 
were yellow green...20 and a half months, 
we didn't see the air. We  were starved over there. So...uh...uh...she says, "When you 

mother and father stays out from the grav
e and they see you." And I was thinking why 
she tells me there're in the grave. Maybe they
 ar e still alive. Maybe
 we will meet. I still 
hoped that we will meet some body. They went
 only to...because we were in the ghetto. 

We didn't know what was going on over there.
 We didn't have mail. We didn't have 
papers. We  didn't know what was going out 
without the ghetto...out from the ghetto. So 
she says, "But I can't  keep you." I told to let me
...to let us be over night. She says, "I can't 
because on our...on my garden, the "Partisan, the 
Polish Partison, they killed six Jews and 

I will not be a witness. They would come ri
ght now to kill you and they find out you are 

Jewish...I have Jewish." I was thinking she 
was a anti-semite. That's why she doesn't  
want to take us. So the goy got very scare
d. So I told him, "Take us to the Russian 
Ar my." She he came to the Russian... He...he took us to the Russian Army  and he... Over 

there, I came and I asked...I knew one word of 
Russian. .  is Jew in Russian. So I told 
where is . I didn't know how to 
speak . I talked to them inPolish. So they told me  . I 
came to hi m, a young boy in the 20s ma ybe. I came to hi m a nd I told him, "You can talk 

Jewish? "  He says, "No." So I couldn't ta
lk...uh...Russian, but the Russian in Polish in 

similar you know. So I told him that the Partis
ans, the Polish Partis
ans killed...is killing 
Jews when they see a survivor. So he was laughing at me . He  says, "They work. They 

fight with us together." And I saw he is 
by name  only a Jew, but he doesn't  know nothing 
about Jews. I asked about...about.. 
then later.. over night I was 
already over in the office 
sitting because I didn't want to go out out inover there slipping over there. I heard what 

they did. The Russian "girls and the Russian
 girls soldiers and 
it is going over there 
terrible things. So I...I sit in the...in the 
office, and the office was light and he was over 
there. And he said, "Why don't you go to sleep?
" So I told, "I don't like to sleep." And it 
was already second night we didn't sleep. I don't li
ke to sleep. I want here to sit. And he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180  
17 
 
understood probably because he told some thi
ng to the...over there to the Captains, and 
they were laughing. He understood 
why we don't want. In the morning, I went to look for 
a Red Cross and the Red Cross, Russian Red 
Cross and I asked again about "Avery and 
they showed me  a . I went to her and she 
knew Jewish because  she was already in the 
40s. And she told me  how I know you are not Ge
rman spies. I can't  keep you. I told her 
so. You look German spies. Like we. Look at 
us. So she didn't believe. I told her the 
German "M eldacot. I had the "medacot. I showed her. No. She doesn't  believe me . Then, 

it came to my mi nd I have my father and mother in the powder case. I showed her. This is 

my father and my mother. Look good and you w
ill see. I look like my fathe r  and my 
sister looked like my mot her. Look good. Under 
the beard you can't  see, but I have deep 
set in the eyes like my father. And look and 
you will see rese mbles with my father. Then 
she believed us. She kept us over there. Sh
e kept us over there 8 days, and then they 
started to pack and go farther. And they didn't 
want to take us with us because civilians 
they can't  take. So we were walking to Jawi
szowice. It was ...it was very fa r. But the 8 
days by her, we came to us because they ga
ve us good to eat and...and we were sitting on 
the porch to catch some air. And the Pollack
s over there were watching so...watching us 
so and they told through the porch, "We will 
take you here. We will 
take you there." And 
I knew they wanted to kill us. Now...then I understood that the teacher told me  the truth, 

that they kill Jewish survivers. And then 
I went with the Russian Army, we went to 
Jawiszowice, walking. They didn't want us ta
ken on the trucks. They are not allowed. We  
were walking. When we came it was already 
day time. So we asked...we met a Jewish 
boy. I recognize he's Jewish. So I went..."
You see some  Jews. Because we were 
living...we were only the one Jews left." He
 says, "Yes, we took over a Jewish house , 

and we  a house, and we...yal, over there 8 boys 
and you are the first girls what they show 

up." So we came over there. They gave usa room. And over there
...uh...started to come  
in other survivers. Again a surviving, agai
n it was already 12 boys, and then it came  a 
fa mily lived fr om east but they were also save
d. And then I went to the fa mily upstairs. It 
was dark. It went upstairs to the family b
ecause we took over the whole house, the Jewish 
apartment house. I went over there and...and I as
ked how they didn't meet my brother or 
some body. Because I still hoped that some body's
 alive. I knew already then from the 
boys, they...I knew they'r e just the ga s chambers and I started to find out because some  of 
them run away...was already saved, survivers fr
om the...from the gas 
chambers from this. 
So, I...I...I...then I me t my husband. My husba
nd was in uniform. He was fighting. He 
came from Russia because... He was from Kr
akow, but he...he was in Kristallnacht in 
Germany be cause they were in Germany living 
for awhile. So over there, he lost already 
the...the...his brother. He was 13 years. He 
lost...they...they put them in night time, the 
men, in this machine in the concentration cam
p so they started to run away. I think it... 
They started to run away, and he lost...his 
brother was killed. When we came in 1938, in 
1939 came the Russians...the Germans ma rched in, so he runned to Russian. And that's 

why he came with the Russian Army
. And...and then we me t, and...and...and 
then...I...he...from then he came every time from
 his base to...to see me , and...and then he 
wants to ma rry me . So it wasn't  a Ra bbi. Then it came out a Rabbi from under the 

ground. He was hiding some place, and we had 4 
sticks and a blanket,...uh army blanket. 

On the top this was our . A ring a boy friend ga
ve me , a silver ring to ma rried me . and so 
we ma rried. But he, after we ma rried, he was few months and then I got pregnant and 

they sent him to the worsiest fight on the 
. I was thinking now I have a sister...my sister 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180  
18 
 
was sick because she couldn't walk. She had 
arthritis from under the ground. I pregnant. 
My God, what will be here! We  were scaredto go to our hosue. It was only 8 kilome tesr 
from our house, and we were scared to go that
 they will kill us, because they killed ma ny 
Jews after the war, the Pollacks. After the liber ation! So we were scared to go to our 

house. Uh...we had over there, 15 kilo silver, over there under the ground. My 

daddy...uh...buried this under the ground, but I never 
went to take this. I was scared. And 
then...then they ma de a pogram in...in... I will 
not tell you everythi ng because I want to 
sell my grandparents' house and then we were in danger so we  gave up and..and 

then...then I started to...because we ha d to live
...we had to make a li
ving...I started to go 
with my sister to  to make a living. I was 
left alone. My husband was in the army over 
there fighting someplace and I was pr egnant and this. 
 

Q: Linda wants you to tell the story. 

 

A: Huh? 

 

Q: To tell the story. What happened?  You said
 you didn't want to tell the story. She wants 
you to elaborate.  
 

Q: Yal. So...so in the meantime, the Pollacks when we were on the way from  they ma de a 
pogram of Jews, of the few Jews. They put
 under the...under the synagogue. They put 8 
dead children and they say we killed . The 
8 dead children didn't have no parents. They 
didn't...after this, they found out
 that the children were ci
rcumcized. They were Jewish 
children. They probably...the pa
rents left them to...to save 
them, but the Pollacks, they 
saw the parents don't come  back. They killed them. They put under the synagogue. They 

say...they say we killed them for  and they ma de a pogram. So we didn't come  back 
anymore to Jawiszowice. We  left over there 
the things what we took back because my 
husbnad...my husband went with me  before he was sent away, he went with me  to take 
back some  things what we gave to hide before
 the war to the Pollacks. So I left  over there 
the things and we didn't go back anymore.And then we went to Krakow. In Krakow, 

uh...they gave me  a very nice apartment because my husband was a offi cer so they ga ve 

us a very nice apartment, me  with my  sister
. And my sister started to go over there in 
gymnasium.  And in one year, she made all four gynmnasium. She..she was so good. 

Probably I gave her some thing from myself
, wha t  I...I gave her by my...only by my 
me mory, but probably it was left and she 
had a very good me mory. And she graduated 

before in 1 year. In the meantime, I gave 
birth to my boy and I didn't know it was already 
after the war when I gave birth. It was 2 mont
hs a fter the war, 2 and a half months, and I 
still didn't know whether my husband is aliv
e or not. Because from the Russians you can't 
find out. I came  and I told, "Is my husband al
ive?" He was in this and this ? They say, 
"How you know he was in this ?" So I started 
to be scared to tell cause my husband told 
me, but I...I will not tell because these Russian
s, they can...they can, so I...I...I didn't...I...I 
was thinking I told...so they didn't want to tell
 me. When I gave birth, I gave birth in my 
home  because I was scared to go to the hos
pital because it was so over there not clear 
who was  whose is this. They can kill me  or they can kill... And it was anti-Semitic over 

there, the Pollacks and this... 
So I gave birth in my home , but you see about 8 months 
because I was working very hard taking...to ma ke
 a living for me , for my sister, so I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180  
19 
 
taking heavy suitcases. I take 
on consisgnments. I took things
 and took on the markets to 
sell and...and in night time, I felt that the 
water goes away and I didn't know because it 
was my first baby. And befoer I me t over there 
a woma n and she was also a Pearlberger. I 
was thinking this is a...a relative to my
 husband, and I was very...and she was with 2 
children left and she didn't  have a...a apartm
ent and I told come to me and you live with 
me . I have 2 rooms. I will take with my sist
er 1 room and I will gi ve you the other room. 
Because I wa s thinki ng she's a...a...a relative 
to my husband, and it's not I cared about the 
rooms. So I told bring your. And some how 
I don't stop. I was thinking I am urinating. I 
didn't stop to urinate, so she says, Mina, 
you have to give birth and you are only 8th 
month pregnant. So I told, "What you mean?"
 So she says, "Yes. Call your doctor." The 
doctor was a Jewish doctor, but I went to hi
m when I...in 7th month I went to him for a 
checkup. And his hand was shaking because 
he wa s 6 years hiding under the ground. He 
got ma rried with his...with the  what she saved 
him. He lost the fa mily also. He asked me  
if I have mo ney to pay hi m. I told yes and 
I didn't. Because I was scared to go to the 

hospital. But I...I was thinking a Jew even with
 shaking hands, but he 
will not kill me  or 
the baby. So my boy was  born on a kitchen tabl
e 3 days and 3 night
s with anethesia, 
without nothing. He took with...and he told me
, he was so brutal, this doctor. The war 
ma de hi m so brutal or some thing. He  says, 
"Oh you will live or the child will live. You 
have a choice. So I told him this, "I survived 
Hitler and I will surviv
e this too. Just save 
my baby." Because I don't  know whe t her he ha
s a father. Let the name  at least be."  
Because my husband lost the whole family. Let the name at least be. Just save my baby. 

So he was saved. He was born 4 pound baby. 
They couldn't....they couldn't ...uh...a month 

after he was born, no 2 weeks after he was bor
n, it came the first letter from my husba nd 
because he left me  in Jawiszowice. He wrot
e to Jawiszowice. The letter was going from 
one Jewish co mmunity to the other til he cam
e...till the letter came. I was 2 weeks already 
laying flat in bed, and the doctor was angry with
 me  that I don't pay him. And I told him, 
"I don't have, but I was scared to go in hosp
ital so I didn't go in hospital because I was 

scared." But...uh...then after 2 weeks, I found out
 that my husband is alive, that the boy 
has already. I couldn't circumcise my boy b
ecause he was only 4 pounds. The  didn't want 
to circumcise him. So, a nd then it came  out 
ruptures because he was 
crying very much at 

night time  and then in day time, so...so it ca
me  out the ruptures, and the  didn't want...he 
had already the weight, but what
 he has to have to be ci
rcumcised, but he didn't want 
circumcised because of the ruptures, so when 
I find out my husband is alive at least, and 

I...I let him know because he is thinking I 
will ha ve soon the baby, because the baby was 
born before the time . Then I wrote him a lette
r. I knew already wher
e he is stationed. I 
wrote him a letter the baby is already...is al
ready here. He was born about 8 months and 
to come to see him. He went over there to... 
They ma de him a ma yor in a...in a city over 
there. It was on the borde r of the Germans 
because they...the y...they were already...the 
Germans we re already de feated. So, he...he 
wrote me  that I will...I will come  soon, 
because the letters were very long going. 
As soon...write me , they don't wa nt let me  

go...write me  that...uh...you are dying, that ma ybe 
to a dying wife they will let me  go, but 
the Russians, they are high rank Russians. He went to him and he showed him, "I wrote 

him a telegram that I am dying...that your wife 
is dying. Come to see. Because I want him 
to see the baby and the baby was already 2 m
onths old and he didn't see the baby. And it 
was after the war. He was born after it was al
ready 4 months after th
e war. So..so he went 
this telegram, and he says, "Let her drop dea
d, the wife. It's  ma ny wives in the world." So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180

he went. He went without...wit
hout a release, he went to Kr
akow to see me . And he was 
scared to go out in night time because...in da
ytime because he was...he didn't  have no 
papers, or lease papers, he will be killed, but 
he want to see the baby. He want to see me . 

But then later, he...we paid the doctor. He tr
ied to...to ma ke some  
money, pay the doctor, 
because he was on my head. And then..then...uh, 
after the baby was 3 and a half months 
so we moved over there where he was stat
ioned, and over there we were for a while. 
And...uh...then we waited til the baby...and it was ve
ry danger because  this 19 Poles what 
they killed my brother, they were looking for 
us to kill us because they knew that...that 
we know the name s. And...so they were looking for us and we knew this and from our 

town, one...one goy" came  and he s a w us and 
he recognized us, "O
h. You are here. You 
are alive?" And we were scared he will tell 
over there, but we couldn't move. The child 
was....we want to run away from Poland. My
 husband was already released from the 
army, but...but the...we...we were scared from
 the Pollacks that they will go... In the 
meanti me,  pogram they made Jews. They
 killed ma ny Jews over there, and a young 
couple what they just got ma rried, they k
illed. And you see, they
 were stopped right 
away, but...by the Russians, but in the meanti me, they ma naged to kill quite few...quite 

few. It wasn't so ma ny, but they couldn't stand 
it that we are still aliv
e, that a few of us  
left. And...and then they...uh...we were waiting til 
my son will be 1 year old that we will 
be able to...to go because we had to go out from
 Poland illega l. They coul d not let us, the 
Russians, go and they know we are Po
lish Jews. So it was organization, Jewish 
organization, what they came  and they tell us
 that we will be able to go like...like Greek 
Jews, not to talk on the border, not to
...uh...because we...not to show that we know 
Polish, so we  smuggled one year old baby, we 
had a cottage. Aw, I didn't tell you even 
that my girlfriend from my town and sh
e...because in every Jewish community we 
registered. We registered. I am Mina Pear
lberger from home , Mina Glucksma n from 
Tyczyn, daughter of Nafstali and Hanna Ma
lkak Glucksma nn so if some body come s 
j
from the family, they came to the Jewish community and they H see that some body's 

left, you know, and this way we can find each 
other. We  are still hoping that my brother 
will show up. Not this what was killed by the 
Poles, but the other. He was such a healthy 
boy that ma ybe he survived. Still hope...hope that some  cousin will show 

up...some...s ome... So we registered. So...my gi
rlfriend, she saw me  registered over there. 
She came to me  in Krakow before I went 
to my husband, and she...she brought me ...she 
stayed with me , and she brought me  this car
riage for the baby. Because when not, I was 
carrying him on the hand because I didn't have...I had on my...such a long pillow, and I 

can carried him in the hand. And then...then I 
had this carriage. We  we nt...we smuggled 
through the border and they they took us fr
om over there to Czechoslovaki a. From 
Czechoslovakia to...to Austria. Over there 
I ma de sketches and I ma de some ...and my boy 
was still not circumcised because he had st
ill the ruptures. And then he went... uh...my 

sister and my husband, my baby... (end of Tape 2, Side B Tape 2) 
 

A: Okay. You can go ahead now. 

 

Q: So, when we were smuggled through th
e...they told to throw everything what you 
have...every...every identification, every pictur
e. I had pictures from my husband from 
the Army, a nd my husband says...he was very sc
ared from the Russians. He says, "Throw 
away everything." I throw..thr
ew away. But then he was not
 looking, I went back and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180

found still his pictur es. The "Milicot s I didn't find anymore. They were already dirt the 
top all kind of things. I couldn't find them. But 
the diaries. I take my sister/s diary and I 
took and I hid under, before we went over the 
border, I hid this under the ma ttress of my 
baby, you know. My husband didn't know. And in my report got from the ...from 

the...from the business school I...I
 saved still. And when we pa
ssed the border, I told him, 
"You know I have this." He says, "Are you cr
azy. When they catch us they would...they 
would sent us to Siberi a state or they will ki
ll us."  So I told hi m, "But I saved." So he 
says, "My God. How nerve you have to save this." But I am glad I saved this. I 

have...from his Army I have many, but I brough
t only a few. And the pictures..from home 
this pictures from my fa mily I have only from
 my aunt here. I would have this. I have my 
father and mother and my brothers. They had li
ttle small pictures from the "Milicots but I 
didn't have this pictures. Uh..So then...when 
we passed one time, it was...we were staying 
in this palace and they gave us...the Joint
..over there took care in...
in Austria of us. And 
they gave us..uh.."Farina for the baby, and he got
 so sick. So I went to the kitchen, to the 
Joint to ask for tea for my baby because he 
has...he is screaming...he has...so she said 
who told you the...the...from Joint...the woma n, "Who told you to have a baby?  "Who 

told you? "  So I told her, "Are you married
? "  So she said, "No. Now I understand, but the 
baby is...is really sick and can't  I have. It
's  after the hour and you can't  get nothing. My 
husband got so angry. He took a chair from 
this palace what the chair is worth was 
probably I don't know much. He took this in pie
ces. He ma de fire in outside and he ma de 
for the baby bottle ther e. And 
I was still nursing the baby because I was nursing the baby 
til 50 months because I was scared I will not ha
ve  what to eat for him and when we were 

going from Czechoslovakia to...
to...to...uh.. Austria, it was like in a cattle train and I had 
to feed the baby. He was hungry. He was cr
ying. And I was ashame d to...to nurse the 
baby...so ma ny people. How I can do it?  So 
my husband said, "My God. What you want 
the baby to die?  You are ashame d? " So I tol
d, "I will not nurse the baby. I can't." So over 
there was going from Hungarian
 also a couple and they were
 sitting near the wall...near 
the wall on the floor so they understood. They didn't understand Polish, but they 
understood that I am ashamed to..to nurse the 
baby, so they ma de me  pla ce...come here 

and sit down to the wall turn to the wall, andthey gave me  the...the place over there and 

from...then they say you sit here and they will 
sit in the mi ddle. And from then we got to 
be very good friends. We came to United States
. First over there to this displaced person 
camp. We...every time  we said we
 are sisters so they wouldn't
 divide us. We  want to be 
in one...in one...because they gave only one room for...for 2, 3 fa milies. We  want to be 

together so we were very good friend even 
in United States. So they gave us...one time 
they gave us to...when we came already to...to 
Germany, they put us in a...in a barrack. 
They want us to go down to a barrack. So my
 husband says, "It is now our turn. How I 
can with a baby be in barrack...no in a tent. Ho
w I can go to a tent?  Then to a barrack. He 
says, "With a baby in such a cold, how we can do...change the diaper
s and everything?" 
So...uh...in the meanti me, my baby got...uh...we didn't want to go down from the train. In 

Germany we want to go to a room. We ma de
 a strike in the army...the American Army. 
Over there was the USO...Ame rican Ar my...uh...so they took me  the baby got 40 

fever...40...102 fever, so they took me  with the 
baby to a hospital in Frankfort and they 

want me  the baby to live with them. And they...i
t's only for babies. I to
ld, "I will not trust 
the Germans my baby." I will not trust my baby 
to the Germans. I want to be with my 
baby. So they couldn't...they...my hus band was over there on the train, striking with my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180  
22 
 
sister. And then I...then they gave me  a room in a hospital and he was crying and a doctor 
came and he asked me ...and I want to go to...to...
wash his diaper and when I went to go 
out, he started to cry. So...a doctor came  in 
and he asked me , "Who is sick?  You or the 
baby?" I told, "My baby." What he is...somehow
 he has a cold, so what you are doing in 
this hospital, this  hospita
l. You imagine what the Germans di d to me ?  Good the boy 
didn't let me  go out. Wh en I go out and I wash over there, I would...I took my coat. It was 

already so cold. I put it on the baby the coat
 and I was telling, "You murderers." I was 
screaming. "You Ger ma n Murderers." Didn't you 
have enough to kill my whole fa mily. 
You want me to give a diseas
e in... You put me  in such a 
hospital to give me  such a 
disease." I wa s screaming so. And "Give me  
bac k to Bergenhousen my husband. I don't 
want to be here. I don't trust you my baby. You...you killed my whole fa mily. I don't trust 

you. I was so screaming that they were so
 ashame d because I was screaming so loud. 
Everybody stand in the street and listen to so
 the Germans..was German already. So they 
put me  on that truck, a open truck with the baby to go to Bergenhausen and 

Bergenhausen I came in and I was so glad th
at I didn't go to...that the boy didn't let me go 
to wash the diapers that I didn't touch some th
ing over there. And I told the story to my 
husband and he started to ma ke fire it wa
s like an iron...an iron...uh...s
tove. He started to 
ma ke fire and the whole night and over ther
e was Jewish doctors too because they came  
from Russian also...a Jewish doctor and she t
ook care of the baby and he had bronchitis. 
And...and they saved him. And...and...then...the
n...we were to the barrack for awhile. 
They want us to send to a displaced person cam
p, and they want us to di vi de with this 
Hungarian so I told she is my sister. Nobody divide us in time from Hitler. You'll not 

divide us now. Because we were very good...we got
 to be in the traveling, we got to be 
very good friends. I didn't  know them before". And...and then we were sent to  near 

Darenstock, near...not far from Frankfurt. A
nd over there we were in displaced person 
camp. Also in terrible conditions. In one room
 they put us in, they took from the Germans 
three rooms. One kitchen was not a kitchen, only 
a like little stoves...fir
e...electric stove, 
and the whole family...the whole 4 familie
s have to use this little st ove. No...no 
bathroom, no to take a bed. Nothing. One only... uh...ladies room for the whole fa mily. 

You i magine in such conditions they kept us 
3 years. We  registered
 in...registered to 
come  to the United States because I know my fa
ther has here two sisters and I was so...I 
knew it mus t  be cousins, and I was so hungry to have some  family, to belong some place. 

Not to take some . I didn't tell even tell th
at I I have fa mily to nobody because I didn't 
want to come to them to be a burden 
to them. Only to...to know that we belong 
some thing, that we have a fa mily. In the 
meantime, in Germany my...my l ittle boy got 
one operation on the...on the ru
pture and the other operation, 
then it was born...I got 
pregnant and I had a baby. Again, a boy baby. Th
e baby was born with kidneys what they 

didn't work. They weren't sick, they were ba
d built, and he was living only 3 and a half 

months and he died over there. He wa s on th
e list to go to the Unite
d States too and we 
were waiting 3 years til they 
called our quota in terrible condi
tions over there. My sister 
started over there to go in Colle
ge in Frankfort..in college fo
r dentist for doctor dentist 
and...and she, in the meantime, they called us
. She had already 2 years over there what 
the practice she had to leave behind. So when 
they called us to go to the United States, 
my boy...my ...the boy died a month...a mont
h before we were...we were called, and 
we...he was buried in Frankfurt and the last
 mone y we made for him a mo nument in 
Frankfurt and we came here to the United St
ates without one penny. 
Without one penny!. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0180

We ca me  on the...my sister had...I had here in 
the United States a very rich cousin. This 
means she got married to a very rich ma
n...to and...and he sended...for my sister he 
sended papers, so they knew that she is a fam
ily, but they didn't  connect me  later here in 
the United St ates with her. Only they sent 
for my...that she's comi

recognized my aunt because they sended that 
pictures. I recognize one aunt and the uncle 
and I went to them and I told I am M i na P
earlberger and I am Nafstali's daugher. "" I saw 
they got scared. They were thinking we cam
e on their shoulder you know. So I told don't 
worry. I talk to them in Jewish. Don't  worry. 
Don't tell that you are my fa mily cause the 
Joint will take care of me. I didn't have one 
penny for my boy. Five o'clock they let us 
down from t he ship. So he couldn't eat. 
And they by the...we had...on the way, we had a 
storm. You can't  imagine. It was terrible. 
The...the...I got sick and he...we had a storm 
and everybody had to put on the...the safety j
ackets and it was terrible that..uh.. And then 
I...I saw...I..I came and saw that
 they are scared a
nd it hit me  that they are scared. I knew 
why they are scared. A family come s and 
they were not rich. My aunt. And I was 
thinking, I told her, "Don't  tell that you are my
 fa mily because the Joint will take care of 
me ." So...so then my boy was running around. 
He didn't eat nothing. Five O'clock he 

couldn't eat. And they told on the loud speaker
 whoever takes out food will be se nt back 

to Europe. So I was thinking, scared to take
 out the food for him, and he didn't eat so 
early he couldn't eat so early. So I...I..uh..he 
was...It was already 2 o'clock and he didn't 
have nothing in his mouth. He was running aw
ay and excited. He was not quite 4 years 
old. He was excited, running around til. And...and they didn't... they want us to send to 

Portland, Oregon, and my sister in Ne w York. 
And I told I will not let myself separate 

fr om my sister. And because this was really 
my sister and then til they settled til what, 
my husband went the first and the last time he
 went to the policemen. He c ouldn't talk 
one word of English. He showed them the boy. He took the boy by the hand. He showed 

him the boy and he showed some ...showed some thing to drink for the boy. The 
policemen took out 25 cents and we never fo
rgot this. And he gave... and my husband 
wants to ask him where to send back the a
ddress. He couldn't talk to him. And he 
gave...because he never took charity from nobody. And he..uh..we bought him a glass...a 
glass of milk, a container with milk and a ro
ll from this money, but the roll he couldn't  
swallow because he was so dried up. Day before
 he ate. And he was after two operations, 
and the third operation, we ma de him the tonsil
s because he had tonsillitis often. Before 
we left, we ma de hi m the tonsil opera
tion. So...and he...he couldn't eat nothing. He 
couldn't swallow anymore. So...And then they 
located us in the meanti me  in  in...in 
Manhattan and they gave us $50 for the whole week to eat outside. How you can...my 

sister went to the  over th
ere, and I with my hus band...how 
you can eat outside for $50 a 
whole week in the restaurants 
so...I... I bought a littl
e cooker...a little c
ooker and I was...I 
went to buy some to make by myself food. It 
will not be enough in a rest aurant to eat. 
How we can live on this. My husband went out
 without language. He
 started to wash 
windows in Broadway. Wi ndows in the stores. 
He  talked to Jewish stores. He talked 
Jewish. And one...one lady in Broadway, she saw my boy a nd she says, "You need to a 

bicycle. I have a 3-wheel bicycle for him." 
And s he gave him the bicycle. And then he 
went to look on signs and he saw Ballantine 
Beer. He went in over there and he asked: 
Who talks here. Polish. Russian. He knew th
