decades.W hat youare about tohearf rom Fritz is one individual's account of a Holocaust. 
W ehave prepareda brief slidepresentation to help with his introduction.
 
 
Fritz Gluckstein was born in Berlin, Germ any, on January
 
24, 1927. This photograph 
was taken of Fritz in 1932.  He was the son of a Jewish judge and Christianmother, Georg and 
He
dw
i g Gluckstein. W e see them at thebeach.
 
 
T hese contemporary photographs show places where Fritz li ved, attended school, and 
played.  Asa child, Fritz enjoyed fam ily activiti es,f riends, and school gatherings.  Here we 
have Fritz circ led in the m iddle.
 
 
Af ter the Nazis came to power, Fritz' f ather lost his job asa judge
 a
nd because of his 
father's and mother's backgrounds, Fritz was considered a geltungsjude, a counted Jew.  The 
Nurem berg Law based Jewishness on genealogy and religious practice. T his is the star that 
Fritz, as a geltungsjude, was required to wear. 
 
 
T hroughout thesediff icult times Elf riede
 
Dressler, Fritz's aunt, providedthe 
Glucksteins with much neededextraf ood as rations continued to decrease. In this photowe 

see Fritz andhis aunt Elf riedeaf ter the war.
 
 
At the endof  the war,Fritz's parents stayed in Germ any and hisfather resumed his 
judicial career. Fritz decided to im m igrate on his own to the UnitedStates and arrived in the 
U.S. in 1948 where hestudied veterinary m edicine. 
 
 
T oday Fritz li ves in theW ashington, D.C. area with his wif e.  Following his arrival in 
the United St
ates afterthe war heeventually becam ea doctorof  veterinary m edicine.  After a 
stint in the U.S. Arm y, Fritz began a long anddistinguished career with thefederal

governm ent, including at the U.S. Department of  Agricultureand ending with the National 
Library of  Medicine.  He became an experton diseases thatare transm ittedf rom  animals to 
humans, like Mad Cow disease and,of  course, in today's contem porary news we think of  
things like Ebola.
 
 
F rit z is  a  s e lf
-
described opera buff andf ootball fan.  He toldm ehe likes to watch 
football onT V while listening tothe opera.  He volunteers each weekfor the Museum  
translating letters andotherdocum ents written in Germ an, including handwritten documents.  
He is among afew people who areableto read the ol
d -
style Germ an cursive script.  He has a 
daughter
, 
Ru t h
,  
and two granddaughters
; o
ne is 16 years old and the other 13.  Fritz says they 
are the joy of  his life. 
 
 
Fritz has authoreda mem oirabout his survi val in Berlin. Af ter today's program  he will

F i rs t  
Person
. W e have justan hour to spend with you and youhave an awf ul lot to share with us.  
I'll get us started rightaway.
 
 
You were just a youngboy when Hitler cam e to power in Germ any.  Bef ore we turn to 
theactual war years, let
™
s start with you telling us about yourf am ily and yourself  in thoseearly 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
5
 
years, what it was like livin g under Nazi power as the power bef orethe war.  Andas part of 
th a t, te ll u
s the meaning of  geltungsjudeandwhat thatm eant to you and your fam ily. 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Letm e start explaininggeltungsjude. Geltungsjude
s 
are children of 
intermarriages who we re raised Jewish. T hey were subject to all rules and regulations
,  
ha
d to 
wear the star,but at large were not deported. Geltungsjudes 
who 
had  l i ve
d  in  B e rlin
 
were less 
likely to be deported than Jews who lived som ewhere else in the country. T he f arther you got 
away f rom  Berlin, the seatof  power, them ore you were subject to the local Kommandant.
 
Children of interm arriages that were not raised Jewish were not subject to all the regulations, 

just afew, anddid nothave to wear the star. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about yourf ather.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  My f ather was a jud
ge
; d
ecorated veteran, IronCross.  He was quite 
patriotic,always the flags on 
High  Ho liday
.  He even taughtm ehow to salute thef lag. 
 
 
Growing up, I went to the zoo,enjoyed theanim als. Take trips.  My m other was 
Lutheranbut we celebrated the Christianholidays.  AndI had the best of  two worlds
: 
 
Passover and Easter and Hanukkah and Christm as. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather,as you said, hewas a veteran of the FirstW orldW ar.
 
>> Frit z G lu ckst e in :   Ye s.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He served in the Germ anArm y.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Correct.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said he was awarded the Iron Crossf or bravery.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes.  Actually, in 1936, the governm ent establishedanhonorf orf rontline

soldiers.  Andm y father received the cross and certif icate stating that he received the 
declaration inthe name ofthe Fuhrer. He lost his job in 1933. T hey gave the decoration.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they throw him  outof  his job as a judge but give him  a decorationf orhis 

F i rs t  W orld  W ar s e rvi c e .
 
>> F r i t z G l u c
kstein:  In 1933 he lost his job. T hey told him :  Don't leave thebuilding by the 
f ront door. There'sa double expression, Nazis.  Father said, 
ﬁ
I cam e in by thef rontdoor and 
I'll go out by thef ront door.
ﬂ 
>> Bill Benson:  And he did.
 
>> Frit z G lu ckst
ein:  And he did.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And he did.  
 
 
You toldm e that thef irst anti
-
Sem itism  that you experienced was associated with the 
1936 Olym pics. W ill you tell us about thoseOlym pics? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  About this tim e 
yo u
 
saw already signs, suburbs, with the sign 
ﬁ
Jews are 
not welcome here
ﬂ o r "E
nterat your own risk."   And even restaurants 
ﬁ
Jews are notallowed.
ﬂ
  
In 1936, the Olym pic 
Gam es
, all signs disappeared.  T he mom ent they were over
,  
t h e  s i gns  
appeared again. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fritz, on
 
a lighter note, you're aboy.  You toldm eaboutm ischief that you got 
into during theOlym pics with the tourists.  You would point out things
 
--
 
if  you don'tm ind 
sharing this. 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  A friend ofm ine.  Ahh, look over here. T here is the war m inistry.  Andthe 

poor people were confused.

>> Bill Benson:  You were having your f un with the tourists.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Had fun with the tourists.  Boys. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthat tim e, Fritz, was your fatherand yourf am ily
 
--
 
did they m ake 
a n y effo rts 
to try to leave Germ any during that tim e? 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes. W eall did. But, actually, at the beginning people thought, well, that 
can't happen.  Many people thought we lived herefor many years, it m ight pass
 b
ut  t he n  of  
course realized it wouldn't
;  
particularly af ter the Pogrom ,Kristallnacht.
 
 
T he United States,f irst there was a quota.  You hadto wait until your quota cam e up.  
It took som etime. And then, of course, you had to get an affidavit
.  T
hat m eans somebody 
had to sponsor you.  Then you had to pay f or the passage.
 
 
W ehad aff idavit, the quota, but it was too late. W e couldn't get passage.  People 
couldn't get out.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to move your m icrophone up just ahair if  that's ok with you.  Ok. 

T hank you. 
 
 
You m entionedKristallnacht.  You were just11 on that night, November
 
9 through 10, 
1938, what we call Kristallnacht or the Night of Broken Glass.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Correct.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that and what itm eant to you and yourfam il
y.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  I still rem em ber going toschool. Saw broken wi ndow.  One window could 

have happen
, t
hen two and three windows.  I realized som ething was going on. W e saw 
sm oke in the synagogues.

How did we know what they used to break? About
 
two months previously, the store 
owner had to have hisname in white letters. All they had todo, here, here, here,and break 
th em . 
 
 
I remember at that time, arrested, sent tothe concentration cam p. My f ather was 
fortunate. 
 
It didn't happen to him  b
u
t it happenedtom any of m y teachers in high school.  I 
rem em ber we hada little note saying dueto special circum stances, report card will be late this 

tim e . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Dueto special circum stances, your report cards would be late.
 
>> Frit z G lu ckst
ein:  Due to 
s pe c ia l 
circum stances, the report card wouldbe late. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you realize that what you saw on that night, theNight of Broken Glass, 

was not justhappening in Berlinbut it was happening all over Germany?
 
>> F rit z G lu c k s t e in :   Y
es. W efoundout.  Actually, it was m uch wore away f rom Berlin. Berlin 
is  a c t u a lly
 
--
 
f riends phoned us.  
ﬁ
How are you doing?
ﬂ
  
W ell,they broke windows.  T hey broke 
in. T hey demolishedthe apartm ents. It was m uch worse away f rom  Berlin. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:  Fritz, you toldm e that the start of the war itself , when Germ any invaded 
Poland on September
 
1, 1939, thatonce thathappened,events andcircum stances changed in 
a really big way.
 
>> Frit z G lu ckst e in :   Ye s.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what changed.
 
>> F
rit z Gluckstein:  Actually, thenight before that
,  
Jews had to take the m iddle nam eIsrael or 
Sarah.  My name was Fritz Israel Gluckstein.W e got a special identif ication card which we  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

hadtopresent every tim eat the governmentoff ice. I am a Jew.  Show
 
it.  Andeach signature 
was Frit z Israel Gluckstein.  Jewish identif ication hadnum ber and this is so
-
and
-
s o.   F oo d  
rationing, of course.  Jews did not getf ood rations,no special allotment. No white bread
,  no  
m eat. And, of course, we were only perm itted to shop between 4:00
 
and 5:00
 
in the afternoon.  
My m other couldn't shop at other tim es.  Adecent store
keeper, 
ﬁL
et me have yourf am ily's  
Ration cards
, ﬂf
illed the order. 
 
 
Of course, we had tohand over furs, radios, jewelr y, and instrum ents. We were
 
not 
perm ittedtohave haircuts.  You can't im agine.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Am ong the many things youwere no longer allowed tohave, that included 

p e ts. 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Pets, actually, yes. W ehadto give awa y
 
--
 
the deportation started.  Of 
course people at that tim e had to give their pets.  Lateron the restriction to have pets came 
later.
 
 
Actually, what happened, every ni ght a new r estriction. It was just harassment.  You 
alm ost waited
:  W
hatwas the next law?  And, of course, deportation had starte
d.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid you have to start wearing yello w stars? 
 

>> Frit z Gluckstein:  About the time 1941, the yello w star.  Had to be worn right here.  Actually 
thepopulation behaved very well.  I rem em ber happening tom e walking on the street and 
som eone just walkedahead of me and then a canof  soupor m ilk orsom ething.  Occasionally 
there was a
 
nasty policem an. See the star improperly fastened.  So help you if he were behind 
yo u
 
with a pencil
.

>> Bill Benson:  Ithad to be on sotight he could not puthis pencil behind it.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Stars we had to wear.  And we had to handover ration car
d
sf or the star. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had to buy it.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Ration cards with the star.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to com ebackto the fact that you couldn'thave dogs because you 
had a dog.
 
>> Frit z G lu ckst e in :   Ye s.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In many ways it's ironic thatyou went on to become a veterinarian ora degree 
in veterinary m edicine.  You had a specially tr ained dog.
 
>> F r i t z G l u c k s
tein:  Yes.  Friends were deported. W etook the dog.  Yes.  It was trained to 
walk in a special way.  When thedog cam e,his neck.  From  the Nazi .  He didn't take it. T hen 
for the Jew.  Then he took it. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith your fatherhaving lost his job and the ability togo outand shopf or Jews 
between 4:00
 
and 5:00, although your mother could goout, how didyou m anage to makeends 
m eet? I think you hadto change residencesat som epoint.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Had to change to a sm aller apartm ent.  Money was tight.  My f ather 
worked unpaid, social service agency, Jewis h welf areagency.  If  ithad not been the war, it 
would have beenm uch worse becauseof  asm all pension. 
 
My aunt really helped us.  She 
boughteverything f rom shoes toeverywhere from  birthday parties.  
 
 
At that tim ealsom y mother's relatives stoodwith us.  Butthe colleagues

rem em ber m yf ather'scolleagues. Oh, we are so sorry; we have tobreak up contact with you.  
My aunt helpeda lot. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were able to stay in school until June of 1942when the schools closed.  

Bef ore we turn to that period, you referred
 
--
 
inf act, you write in your book so eloquently about 
your
 
teachersas everyday heroes.  Can y
ou say som ething about that? 
 
>> F r i t z G l
u ckst e in
:  Ye s.  A ctu a lly, a t th a ttim e ,
 
in school, thedeportation already had started. 
Cam e in them orning. One was your neighbor.  The teachers, they cam e to school every day 

in ver y diff icult times to teach us. T hey didtheir ver y best. T hey helped
 
m ef ora while with  the 
uncertainties.T hey gave m e afoundation onwhich I could build going back to school. 
 
W hen I was their student, itdidn'toccur tom e that the teachers were facing actually 
deportation; thattheireff ortsto live up to their prof ession.  But I realized that they were under 
great depth.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you really dopay tribute to them  soeloquently. 
 

>> Frit z Gluckstein: They cam ef acing deportation but they still came and taught us
.  A ctua lly, 
the school was an o
a sis.   O n ce
 
the schooldoor closed, we were students.  At the end it was 
35 andonly seven survi ved.  T here weref our Catholics including me and two.  One went in 
hiding.  One cam e back from the concentration cam p.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And am ong the teachers virtually al
l 
--
  
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Most teachers all perished. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  All perished. 
 
 
W hen you received yourfinal report card in June
 
1942,that was, indeed, yourf inal

report card.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Yes, it was.  1942. T hereason why it was bec
ause of  the dissolution of  
the Jewish school system
; t
he reason this was in 
‚
42.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas the end of your education.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: The endof m y education.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And right af terthat you were forced to have to go towork
.  
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Actually, I worked for a short tim eat the cemetery.  It was kind of for the 
local Jewish welf are agency.  But then, of  course, deportation.  Som etim es while in school we 
took tim eout tohelp people carry the luggage tothe deportationpoints. Actually the beginning 
of  the deportation. People received the notice you were deported such and suchday.  You 
have to give a list of  your belongings.  A certain day som ebody came
, s
ealed theapartm ent.  
T hey had to go to the nearest collection point.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Inf act, you had a very f rightening experience whenyour mother triedto help
 
--
 
>> Frit z G lu ckst e in :   Ye s.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us that. 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  My m otherhelpedf riends to the collectionpoint.  T he Gestapo
:  
W
hat  a r e  
you doing?  You'rehelping Jews.  I bet you have a Jewish fam ily.  You have to report 
tomorrow downtown at so
-
and
-
so at the central collection point.
 
 
W ell, thenext day m y fatherand I reported.  It was a formerf orem an. W e were put in 
a room  with six m en. T he Komm andant was a notorious ViennaGestapo captain known f or 
his brutality. W e were forbidden. Nobody is going to lie down during the day. W edid it

anyhow.  But we were never caught. And why not? T he building guardedby regular police
.  
T hey cam e around whenever the Komm andant," Get up, get up; he's com ing."  Rem arkable.  
Had they been caught, they would have been sentto theeasternf ront.
 
 
Af ter a week or so somebody cam eand saidhadto report in 10m inutesfor 
interrogation. My f ather andother gentlem enpreparedm e. Don'tbe a hero.  Don't show signs 
of  hostility or contem pt.  Answer questionsf irm ly but do not volunteer anything. 
 
 
W hen I got there, sitting behindhis desk
f
ive,10, SS inthe proceedings.  Threatened 
to cut me. 
 
Yourm other is Jewish.  I saidm y m other is Aryan. W ell, they asked me some 
questions
:  
W hatare you doing with the shop?  I tell you som ething, you come over here, got a 
decent Jewsf or job.  Out.  
 
 
Out I went. T om y surprise If oundm y f ather.  And he stepped outside. I remem ber it. 
 
In 1943, m y 16thbirthday.  Butactually it was thef irsttim e I had a run
-
in.  I was working at the 
com pany thatm ade instrum ents.  I don't know what they were, probably for the Air Force.
 
In them orning, the guard sitting there with the stuff. Suddenly the door opens.  SS com es in.  
"T
ake your coat
.  O
utside."  Ok. W aited.  And then cam ethe off icers. T ell the driver to get the 
truck here.  
 
 
I remember this moment because to call thedriver he useda very pretentiou
s  te r m ,  
power driver.  T hetruck came. W ehad to go on thetruck back to the SS. We were driven 

downtown. W e wound up in what was a kindof  dance hall,entertainm ent center. Tables and 
chairs were pushed aside. W e were lying in them iddle.  Idon't know f or how long.  It was 
actually something.

Saturdays was half a day work.  T he workers
 
--
 
they were sitting at hom e.  You can't 
im agine they wondered what happened to their children. W e were therefor hours.  Andaf ter 
that, m yf riend and I were interviewed by som em en acted quite nice. " G
e t o ut  of  h e r e.  W e 
don't want Jews in here again."  
 
 
W ell, we are lucky. W e stepped out. And by doing so, we broke the law because of 
the curfew, 8:00. W e shouldn't have been outside after 8:00. T his was a law. 
 
It wa s no t 
written down. Peoplewent to the police andsaid Ihave tohave perm ission to visit m y father in 
thehospital.  A special pass. Didn't know wh at I was talking about. 
  
I went hom e.  My m other 
just was awa y visiting her aunt. Said it would be
 
nice if  
you 
would com e home.  My father was 
pickedup elsewhere and sent to another collectionpoint.
 
 
W ell ,  en d
 
of  them onth, ration cards had to be picked up.  Usually my m other did it but 
I had to do it. W e went to the ration card office. T here was a
 
m oving truck there. T hey drove 
us toanother co
ll

Scientists,businessmen, course of hum an nature. W iththree other classmates andthe other

W

And,of  course, taught us som ething else. They taught ustoexplain the vulgar

T he Gestapo. You could tell the guys the way they looked.  In 
the van. All right, in the van.  Half anhour. W here we were, the headquarter of Eichmann.  

Eichmann'sheadquarters had takena hit.  Eichm ann was the driving f orce behindthe 
deportation.

I want him .  He looks

I  was ver y luck y

Never an antagonist

be l o ng 
there. All the others I see, some of the otheroff icers

a captain lived inthe building.  Hewas

Suddenly, " Eichm ann is com ing."   Of course,we all know who Eichm ann was.  And I 
wondered how he would look.  Ididn't know what to expect.  Cam e. Ordinary.  Nobody would 
ever have noticed him in a crowd.  Cam e
 
up,stood right next tom e,gave som e instructions 
and lef t.
 
 
At one tim e we had torem ove debrisf rom  thef ront of the building. T here were two 
guards to watchus.  One guard, anasty guy, alwa ys cursing us andharassing us.T heother 

guard looked at us, never said a word.  Andwhenever we tooka break,hefound something on 
theother side. It was obvious.  Made a point of  notharassing us. W hy?  How did he getinto

the SS? It was am azing even there two people, onehardand thisordinary soldier.  Am

>> Bill Benson:  Fritz, of course, as you described to me as the war ground on, com ing to a 
close Berlin was bom bed repeatedly,f ood was scarce, conditions got more andm ore diff icult.  
Under those circum stances at thatpoint
 
how did yourf am ily
 st

and stay warm ? 
 

>> Frit z Gluckstein: W ell, some of us workedon thehouse. W etook window f ram es, 
occasionally a beam , saw a beam  inhalf .  Nobody caughtus. It would have been harsh. 
 
And, food, well, f ind som e bread. W e had bread.  The m
o is t
 
got intoit. W hatdid we do? W e 
cut off the endstoeatthe bread. W e knew som eone in the country who could get some 
potatoes.  Andm y father knew a baker that helped, too. 
 
 
And,of  course, the stories helped,helped us.  Let me tell you a couple of those. You 
mi
ght like them.  A Minister of  Propagandafell into a river, a river that goes through Berlin. A 
young gu y pulls him out.  He says
:  O
h,m y goodf riend, you saved me. W hat can Idofor you? 
W ell, the gentleman said, I'd likea statefuneral. Why a statefuneral? W ell, whenm y f ather 
f inds out,he's going to kill m e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So very, ver y m uch 
dark 
humor here.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: W ell, SS,a Jew, I'm going to shoot you, kill you.  But if  you can tellm e 
wh i
ch one of m y eyes is a glass eye, I let yougo.  Oh, very sim ple. It's your right eye.  How 
did you know? W ell, itlooks human.

at  s om e 
pointthe Russiansareright on the outskirts of Berlin. T hey're on the way.  Now you're forced 
to build defensive works against tanks. Tell us about this. 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: W e were dispatched toa location where we have tobuildfoundationsfor 

a new Berlin after the war.  T his was in 1944. W ell,actually, f oronce we built som ething and 
didn't break anything.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you
 
f inish. Therethey are in essentially what's becom ing the rubble of 
Berlin, building thenew Berlin.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: The Russians are close. W e're building a new one.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Anew Berlin.
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein:  Iwas building f oundationsf or a new Berlin after the war. T hen we we re 

sent to the southern part of  Berlin tobuild tank
 
b a rri e rs .   W
e workedwith beam s intothe 
ground at a35

>> Bill Benson: T o stop tanks. 
 
>> Frit z Gluckstein: To stop the tanks. 
 
W ell, af terhours we can go. W ell, we lookedat our 
handy work and wondered:  How long will it take the Russians to get through?  One said
:  I
t 
wi ll take 31m inutes.  The tanks,the Russians come, stop,the crew wi ll laugh f or30m inutes 

and will take onem inute to get through.  
 
 
Actually, that happened. Two arm iesattacked Berlin,east and the southern part. The 
southern part got in sofast into Berlin. T hey couldn't get to the Jews.  Thought it was a littlebit 
liberationof  Berlin.  We didn't do a very good job because of obstacles.

what lif e was like asthey cam e intoBerlin and what life was like in thatdevastated city in the 
m onthsaf terthe war.  Tell us, if  you can, what it was like for your own liberation, when you 
knew that the war was over f or you. 
 
>> F rit z G lu c k s t e in :   Ac t u a lly,  
when did we know the war was over?   One day, close toSS 

barracks
, w
hat did we see? There was a line of  trucks pushed by SS men.W ell, what a sight.  
I was delighted to see that. Really, thepleasure of  somebody else'sdiscomfort. W eknew if  

the SS didn'thave gasoline, then the dem iseof  theT hird Reich can't befar off. W eknew it 
was over. 
 
 
W ell, Iactually rem ember the Russians cam e in.  At that tim eI actually was
 
a wa y

At that tim enobody had their r

W he n I  c am e

W hen the war was ove r, we survi ved. W e had the passes,of  course. T he 
devastation on the street, housesf lattenedattim es,no wateror electricity.  But af ter a while
 
--
 
we were f ortunate.T hey sent usto the suburbs
,  
to ahouse. This was particularly fortunate 
because we could plant
 
beans inf ront, tomatoes and potatoes in theback.  Food was quite

Actually, Berlin, of course, was occupied by the Russians, the French, the British, and 
the Americans. W e were lucky to be in theAm erican sector.  You could tell each one's 
occupying power, who was responsiblefor thef eeding.  If it was dark bread, it was Russian
s.   
If it was white bread, the W
estern powers. 
 
 
Of course, after a while we got care packages.  It was quite som ething.  At that time 
eachpackagehad everything f rom napkins to toiletpaper.  Andm ost im portant were the 
cigarettes.  Cigarettes, if youhad cigarettes,you had it made.  And, of course, whatbrandwas 
im portant, too. T hey were all welcom e, but Cam el, Lucky Strike,and soon.  But even gold 
would not count.  Couldn't do anything, blackm arket. 
 
I still rem em ber just before I goton the 
boat to leave we were told:  Ladies and gentlem en, rem em ber, them om ent you setf ooton the 

boat, a cigarette is just a cigarette. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  No longer currency.

.  
I wanted opera tickets.  I have 
som e cigarettes.  You've got them.  But,of  course, toughest 
‚
4 5,  
‚
46, a very diff icult winter.  But 
you lived outside,as Im entioned,at the house in the suburbs. W ewent into the woods, cut 
our own wood.  But,of course,noelectricity, and,of  course,no water. T he sewers didn't work.  
You couldbury the waste in the ground. Butwhat about inthe city?W hat did you 
do ?   W ell,  
not very delicate,but you could see people posting little packages infront yards and at the 
parks.  As long as it was cold,f reezing, it was ok. But when it thawed, well, you can im agine 
what happened.

years without school?
  
It was quite diff iculttogo back to school. Som eof m y form er
