> Nat Shaff ir: Ok. As you saw on the mapwhere Rom ania was, Rom ania was the border 
between Rom ania and Hungary.  T here was a small patch of land called 
T ransylvania
.  T ha t's 
where m y f am ily cam ef rom . My f ather was the youngest of six andm y m other the 
oldest of  
11. They stayed in Rom ania until m yf atherm arriedm y m other
.  F
rom there they m oved to a 
sm all area close to 
Lasi
 
called Bucium. T hey opened upa big dairy f arm  at thatpoint. T he 
rest of thef am ily did rem ain in 
T ransylvania
.  
>> Bill Benson:
  
T ell us a littleabout the dairy farm and who they served, how they m adeends 
m eet with thedairy f arm .
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: My f ather and two brothers,actually, when they lef t Hungary they openedthis 

big f arm  in Romania. They served prim arily for the Romanian Arm y all their dairy products and 
for the com munity of  the sam earea.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he little com munity you live d in was Bucium ?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Bucium . It's a small agricultural village, sm all agric ultural area.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what your home was likef rom  what you know.  As you say, it was very 

rural.  You hadnoelectricity.  I don'tbelieve. 
 
>> Na t  S h af f ir:  No .
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:W ell, life was norm al, what we considerednormal at the time. Agai
n , with o ut 
electricity, without indoor plum bing
, b
ut we were pretty happy.  W edidn't know anything 
different. Being a young child, m y sister a little older, we did have certain chores to do butlif e 

wa s o k.

>> Bill Benson:  Lif e on thef arm .
 
>> N a t  S h af
f ir:   E xa c t ly .
 
>> Bill Benson: W as your family religious?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yes, my f am ily was religious. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In Bucium , which was a small comm unity, was there m uch of a Jewish 

comm unity there?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Nota big Jewish comm unity but at least had threefam ilies, two brothers ofm y 
father plus some otheronesas well.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about your sisters.W hen were they born in relation to you?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: My sister, two years apart.  My sister born
 
in
 
1934, andm y younger 
sist e r wa s 
born 1938. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that at that tim eyou don'tbelieve there was really a lot of  
anti
-
Sem itism, at leastthat yourfam ily was aware of , in thatarea.
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: It wa sn o ta n ti
-
Sem itism. W henm y parents moved to that
 
location, f or 20 
years they li ved in thatarea inBucium . Andm y f ather was pretty much dealing with and 
helping out otherfarmers as well.  For 20 years they were trading with these people. There 
was no problem  whatsoever
 w
ith any anti
-
S em it is m .
 
>> B i l
l Benson:  As you had said to me, yourlif e was modest but you had what you needed 
andeverybody was rel atively content at that tim e in that comm unity.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:  T hat's correct.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we m ove on, youtoldm e youhad three different
 
b irth d ate s.

7
 
>> Na t  S h af f ir:  Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:W ell, obviously when I was born, to be recorded into the official record,my 
father andm y m otherhadto travel to the large city.  Som etim es ittook a week. Som e
tim es it 
tooka month. Som etim es it took a couple of m onthsto record ourdate of birth. Som y father 
actually putour date of birth into aBible stating exactl y the date when we were born.  So many 
tim es theBible gotm isplaced.  At one pointmy m other 
told m e that I was born Decem ber
 
28 ,  
1938.  Andone point Iwas born Decem ber
 
29 ,  19 3 7.   
 
 
Andf inally the reasonwhat happened,I hadan uncle, which later I'll tell you a littlebit 
about,he came to Israel one year in July and his children wished him  a happy birthday.  And 

m y m other who was alive at the time says, 
ﬁW
hathappy birthday in July? W hen you were 
born, there was snow on the ground.
ﬂ
  
So what he did, he send away to the Rom anian 
governm ent to request thebirth certif icate.  And he got itback exactly m other was correct. He 
was born in February, not in July.  So I didthe sam e thing.  I send awa y to the Romanian 
governm ent to get a copy ofm y birth certif icate
 a
ndf inally received it af ter som any months.  
Received m y birth certif icate saying that I was born December
 
26, 1936. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hanks for that. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Sonow I have two birthdays.  My children sometimes m iss ita littlebit.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You get to celebratetwice
?
  
T hat's the question. 
 
 
Although W orld W ar II bega
n with Germany and Russia'sattack onPoland in 
September
 
1939, it wasn't until 1941 that thelives of  yourf am ily and other Jews in your 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
8
 
comm unity near the city would changedramatically. W hat can youtell us about that period 
between the war beginn
i n g i
n Europe in Septem ber
 
1939
 
and the events that ledup to the fall 
of  1942?  Really that two
-
year period, what do you know about that?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: As I mentioned, we lived in this farm for probably 20years.  All ourf arm er 
f riends,farmer neighbors, were pretty goodwith us
, t
hefarmers as well. W e also had a 
neighbor,a priest.  And he would com eby to thehouseoncea week asking my fatherf or 

donationsfor the church and also askfor dairy productsf or some ofthe neighbors that couldn't 
aff ord.
 
 O
ne tim e in 1942, theend of 1942, he showed
 
--
 
that sam epriest showed up with two 
policemen, armed policem en, and two 
Iron Guard
 
soldiers. T he individual who was in charge 
of  thesefourpeople told m yf ather that we have f our hours to vacate theproperty
 
and m ove.  
T hey told usthat we could getone horse and one cart,one wagon, whatever we can carry and 
put in that wagonf or the nextfour hours, that's what you're going to have. 
 
 
First of all,m y f atherasked this policem an,he said, 
ﬁL
ook, I've known your fam ily for 
so many years, known you since you were a little child.  Can't 
you 
do something about it?
ﬂ
  
He  
said, "
T
hat's why we're  gi ving you four hours."  Otherwise we wouldn't gi ve thefourhours.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we continue talking about that because thatwas thef all of 1942, you 
had livedf ortwo years af ter war began in Europe
 
--
 
do you know what affectthe war was 
having, if  any, bef ore you actually were f orced tom ove? I think thegovernment began 

im posing anti
-
Sem iticm easures right away, beginning with the war.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:  T he 
I r on  G ua r d
 
was ver y anti
-
Sem itic, actually did the dirty work f or the Nazis.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Germ any never occupied
 
--
 
never cam e intoRom ania itself.  But the 
Iron Guard
 
did everyt hing 
for the Nazis, whatever  they asked t
o d o.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou toldm e that imm ediately therebegan tobe tension generatedby 
the 
Iron Guard
 
and others between Jewish fam ilies and non
-
Jewish fam ilies that had not 
existed before.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T hat's correct.  Actually what happened is they triedto impose a lot of power 
on individual citizens.  For instance, I remember one situation where m y f ather hired one 
individual to cut wood for us.  He cam e with two people. My f athersaid
,  ﬁ
I only hired you.
ﬂ
  
So  
he picked up hisax and sa
ys ,  
ﬁH
ow m any did you hire?
ﬂ
  
My f ather said
,  
ﬁT
hree of  you.
ﬂ
  
S o 
you get the inf ormation of what happened with the 
I r o n G ua r d
. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know if your fam ily or  your comm unity was aware of  what was 

happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe in thef irst coupleof  years of the war?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Notat that tim e. T here was no newspapers, no radios.  No information cam e 
to usuntil later on, probably when we were already in the big city of  
L a si. 
>> Bill Benson:  As you were explaining to us, in thefall of 1942, suddenly denounced by this 

priest and you've gotfour hours to move.
 
>> Na t  S h af f ir:  Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:  So what happened?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: My m other, afterm y father couldn't convince to stay there, m yf ather took the 

three children
, the three of  us, and said
 g
et dressed quick,put on as m any clothes as you can.  
T wo shirts, two pair ofpants, coupleof  pairsof  socks. T he only thing she was able to take, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
she took some blankets, pillows, cooking utensils.  She took som efoodthat wa
s available for 
her
 
atthat point, som edried m eats and things like that to be stored through the winter
, a
ll th e  
cash that we had at that time
 a
ndall the jewelr y.  And we were escorted to a ghettoarea in the 
c i t y o f  
Ia s i
.  
>> Bill Benson: W henI first talked you, you said that whenthat happened, it was like a 
ﬁ
b ol t  
out of  the blue.
ﬂ
  
Those were your words.  And thef am ily was trul y s tunned. T hat's oneof your 
early m emories.  You rem ember that yourself personally, don't you?
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: Ye s, Id o .
  
All of these badmem ories you remember ver y well and very cle arly.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were I thinkf orced to just takeone cart.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T hat's all, one cartand one horse.  Actually thetwo policemenand the 
I r on 
Guard
 
came on horses. T hey actually escorted us 
to  
m ake sure we don't vary, hide, or go 
som ewhere, som eplace else.  So we were actually escortedtoa ghetto area wherem ost of  

the Jewish people lived at that particular time.
 
 
T here were houses in this particulararea, single f am ily homes andm aybe som e 
house hasf our andf ive bedroom s. Once they put us into this ghetto, thisarea, eachfam ily 
received one room
.  S
o in thefam ily that housed m aybefour bedroom s,fourfam ilies livin g 
there. 
 
>> 
B ill B e n s o n
: W hatwere the conditions like there?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Conditions were pretty bad. Again, there was noelectricity, no running water.  

T here was other things, rations, but we never received those because those were pretty much 
sold on the black market. But we received the rationf orbread every t wo days, received a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
quarter of a breadper person.  So afam ily of f ive would receive 1 1/4 bread.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Loaf of breadf ortwo years f or the entirefam ily.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Correct.  The bakery was outside the ghetto. You cou
ld not travel outside the 
ghettounless youhada reason to go, like going to the bakery or go to the kerosene station to 
get the kerosene. All the tim e youhad to wear a yellow star identif ying us as Jews.  Anybody 
who did not have the star and was caughtoutside the ghetto was punished very se verel y.
 
T he Jewish people were lining upevery t wo days to get the breadportion f or thetwo days.  

T he regular population of  the city would just com e and buy whatever  they needed.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you just said,
 
you were able to go outfor bread.  You hadm entioned to me 
that it was considered an open ghetto. W hatdoesthat mean?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T here were 600 ghettos through the Holocaust.  Som eof  them  were closed 

ghettos. Som e of  them  open.  Closed ghettos were primarily either barbed wire enclosure o
r 
wa lls  
enclosure
.   Ou rs wa s a  six
-
block radiusthatpeople were not allowed to leave thatarea.  
Some people actually did leave
, r
isked their own li ves to go out and tried to smuggle in food to 
the ghetto.  Some of them  were successful. Some of them were not so successf ul. T hose 
who were not were eventually shot. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you told usaf ew m inutes ago, the 
I r on  G ua r d
 
did the dirty work f or the 
Nazis.  T ell usa little bit aboutthe 
Iron Guard
, who they were.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:  T he 
I r on  G ua r d
 
was af ascistgroup of  people. The leader at that time aligned 
with the right
-
winged people of Germany, thepeoplef rom  Italy.  And then he actually did all 
thedirty work that the Germ ans requestedof him  to do.
  
The Germans couldn'toccupy every 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
country in Europe.  So what they
 
d id
, they appointed some of the individuals, some of the 
off icers of som eof  the arm ies to do their dirty work.  For Rom ania itwas the 
Iron Guard
. 
>
> Bill Benson:  You would rem ain in th
is ghetto in Socola for three years
, a
lm ost three years, 
until the endof  the war really.  T ell us what life was like for you during that tim eand what was 
happening to other Jews in Rom aniaand in 
L a si 
while you were there in Socola. 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: In  
Romania, it was nota city.  Actually hadother ghettos as well
, b
ut  i n  
Rom ania, 
L a si 
itself, where we were, things were, I would say, normal.  But m en between the 
age of 20and40 weretaken to work every day, railroad station, unloading cratesof  

amm unit
ionfor the Arm y or doing, quote,m anual labor. They would leave in them orning and 
com e back atnight. W om en prim arily did wor k in hospitals. My m other worked in hospitalas 

a nurse.  My older sister who was at that time a little bitolder worked asa 
maid and as a 
babysitterf or some off icers of  the Iron Guard.  The rest of us,I was in charge prim arily of  going 
out and staying in line and getting the bread portion of  the day
 a
ndalso once a week kerosene 
that we were having under the rationprogram .
  
I would say there'snothing else that we were 
able to do there. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. I think asearly as 1941, there was am ajor Pogrom conductedagainst 

Je ws in  
L a si
.  Can you tell usa little bit aboutthat?
 
>> Na t  S h af f ir:  J u ly
 
31, 1941,10,000 peoplewere taken outand actually m urdered.  At the 
sam e token,
 
sam e time, there was two trainloadsof people were loaded in 
La si 
and would 
travel to Calarasi, approxim ately 150
 
kilom eters, back andforthf or three days
; p
eople without 
bread, withoutfood or water.  And whentheycom e back af ter the three days, they came back 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
to  
I a si 
half of  thepeople on the train were dead.  So there was abig, big Pogrom  in1941.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat included som e peoplethat weref rom  yourf am ily
 a
ndf rom  the ghetto tha
t 
you were in.
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: Co rre ct. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Did
 
yo u
 
loseany of  thefam ily m em bers in thatparticular Pogrom?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:W e did lose som e neighbors,numberone
; s
om e cousins.  But also what 
happened, lateron som e of these men wereactually taken away f or slave labor, later on. T he 
m en were notableto com e back on adaily basis anym ore.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you mentioned, there was rationing.  You couldonly get lim itedamounts of  

bread, do it every other day.
  
In that time, how did your f am ily m ake ends meet?  How was  it 
possibleto do that?
 

>> Nat Shaff ir: As long as m y father was there, we still had som e cash available, he was able 
to buy things f rom theblack market.  Af ter he was
 
--
 
af terhe left in1944 until he actually cam e 
bac
k 
--
 
he was shipped out east, helping repair railroad tracksfor the Germ ans.  So at 8,8 1/2 
years old, I gota job, being thehead of thefam ily and
 
taking care of threepeople: m y m other 
andtwo sisters, which was pretty hard. T hisprobably m ust have beenm y worst year of my 

lif e.  In the situations like that,one grows up ver y f ast.  Im ust havegrown up probably 15 
years in a matter of  this year.
 
 
One instance, if I m ight add. W hen we were li ning upfor kerosene,we had these 
coupons.W e lined up, some on Mondays, som eonThursdays. T he attendant of the 
kerosene station would advance f ive people from  the line, take their coupons out f rom  the

of  you would not know that.  But to be able topump gasoline in those days, you had a pump 
with a handle.  You keepm oving the handleback andforththat wouldf ill up a cylinder which 
would consist off ive gallons. And then thehose would put into one of  the cans. 
 
T he f low of  
the gas would go in, that's thef ive gallons.
 
 
T he individual was pretty much a lazy guy, a drunk.  Buthehad the power to tell us 
what to do, what not to do.  So he'll
 
advance five people, take your 
coupons outand go rest in 
the booth.  Som
etim es he'd lighta cigaretteand let the restof  thepeople wait. T henall of a 
sudden something hitm e.  I said, well, this couldbe something that could helpme a little bit.  I 

cam e tothis individual one day.  His nam e isGrigor y.  Said people rem ember names, 
numbers. RememberGrigor y.  I actually ga ve him a title, Mr., or 
S
ir
.  I sa id , 
ﬁ
I'd like tohelp 
you.
ﬂ
  
Now, here
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're 8 1/2?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: 81/2 years old.  He looks atm eand says, " You'regoing to helpme, you little 

Zhidan?
ﬂ
  
Now, Zhidan is a derogatory word for a Jew.  I said, 
ﬁY
eah.
ﬂ
  
He said, 
ﬁH
ow are you 
going to helpme?
ﬂ
  
I sa id , 
ﬁ
I tell you what.  You look tiredand probably sick. W hy don't you 
stay in thebooth.  I'll collect the coupons,bring it in to you. 
 
You take the couponsf rom  the 
ration card.  I'll pump the gas. And when m yturn in line com es, I'd like a little extra kerosene.
ﬂ
  
He didn't say anything.  He says
,  ﬁ
I'll seehow you do.
ﬂ 
 
So two weeks, the next two weeks, I'm  pumping the gasfor the people.  Oneday he 
sa ys t o  m e,  
ﬁN
ext week bring an extra can wi th you.
ﬂ
  
So he gave me som etim esone extra 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

15
 
gallon, som etim es two extra gallons. T hemost I ever see was three.  And once I received that 
extra kerosene, I wasable to trade some of that with other people. Because two things were a 
comm odity, kerosenewas one and bread was theother. 
 
 
Lateron,af ter a while,I becamef riendly with him  also. Som etim es I used to goand 
stand in lineearly in the morning. T hen I realized early in the morning, being am ong thef irst 
ones, would
n ™t
 
be goodf orm ebecause this individual, Grigory, m ight want to hire anotherone 
to do the sam e thing. So I kind of stayed late, come into theend of the line, soI can do all the 

pumping of the gasoline for theentire line almost. 
 
 
So oneday when m y father left, was takenawa y, deported in1944, If ound abottle of 
Slivo vit z, which is a plum  brandy, in the house.  I wrapped it in somerags.  I cam e to him , I 
said,

like you to give m e a ration cardfor afam ily.

He said tom e, 
ﬁA
re you trying to bribe me?  
Because if  youdo,I can have you shot.
ﬂ
  
I said, 
ﬁ
I kno w th a t.
ﬂ
  
 
 
Sof ortwo weeks we di dn't say anything to each other. Af tertwo we eks
,  
he cam e to 
m eand gave m ea ration card f orfour people which m eans I was able to getadditionalf ive 

gallons of  kerosene on aThursday and I was able to geta loaf of bread again form y f am ily.  
And that loaf of bread I was able to tradef oreggs, potatoes.  So youcan imagine,8 1/2 years 
old trading with black m arketeers or sm ugglers.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henI think

we m ay havea chanceto talk aboutthis later.  Later, you 
would becom ea paratrooper.  You were a very brave little boy

so it's no surprise you becam e

a paratrooper. And you had a successful lif eas an entrepreneur. That clearly was also one of  
the things that you exhibitedat a very earl y age.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Im ustsay one thing, though.W hen If irst started totrade

the  f irst tim e  I

ﬂ
  I  sa ys,  
ﬁ
I have some 
extra kerosene and Ihave half  a loaf of bread.
ﬂ
  He  sa ys,  
ﬁ
I'll gi ve yo u three eggs and two 
potatoes f or that.
ﬂ
  
I accepted. Later on I found out that the ratef orthis am ountof  gasoline 
andthe bread was at least four eggs and three large potatoes.  SoI never dealt with this 
individual anym ore since that tim ebecauseIf iguredthat he cheated m e.  He saw a little kid.  
He cheated me
,  
and Inever traded with himagain. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that time were you able to, and your sisters,were you able to get any 

education?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T hat's one thing m y mother alwa ys insisted
, 
on education.  So whatever we  
had lef tover f rom  the trading, she would get teachers in the

 B
ef o r e I  g

som e of thesefarm ers.  And they said, 
ﬁW
hydon't you wait
ﬂ

usually T hursday m orning was 
m arket day.  And thefarm ers would leave 12:00
 
m idnight with the caravan
 
of  diff erent carts 
anddiff erent wagons to go tothe marketand bring their products. So thesefarmers somehow 
got word to m yf ather and said, 
ﬁW
hy don't you wait on the outskirtsof  the ghettoand watch 
the last two wagons.
ﬂ
  
Alwa ys the last two wagons.
  
A sack wouldf all down.  Inside you would 
f ind som e potatoes, som em eats, some bread, some cheeses. Thesef arm ers would actually 
leave m y father because m y f ather helped them out in the past, would drop off certainf oodf or

no longer going to beable to drop off any of this food.
 
 
I'm  sorry. W hat was the question?

You told m e

of  course, you had gone out toget thebread rations. Your m other was very 
af raid of your sister going outand doing that.

young hoodlum s would probably pick m y sisters, especially older sister.  So myf ather always

were liberated, your father was still awa y on thef orced labor 
detail that he was on.  T ell us about the events leading up to the liberation and what was 
happening in 
I a si 
andwhat you knew was about to happen.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T here was m any bombardm ents
 
t h r ou gh  19 4 3,  19 44
, p
robably by the 
Russians,m aybe some by the Americans. But three days bef ore the Russian invaded 
Rom ania, there was trem endousbom bardmentday and night. All the peoplef rom  the ghetto 
would go into thef ields.  They dug up a lot of bunkers, covered with timber. T hat's where they 
stayed through the entire bom bardment.  So three days bef ore they cam e and liberated 
Rom ania, there was trem endousbom bard
me n t.  T
hef ourth day wa s always quiet. W e looked 
out f rom  the slat f rom  underneath 
thebunker and we see these soldiers dressed in long gray 
coats withf ur hatsand a red star on their hat.  And one of the individuals that was in the 
bunker says these areRussians. And right awa y they says we are liberated.  And everybody 
was ver y happy.  But nobody dared gooutofthebunker still at that tim e. 
 
 
Lateron,the next day, we were able to go out. T he Russiansactually brought food, 
stuff , sardines and all kinds of things they gave us. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Prior to the liberationbutduring thebom bardments, you were, of course, 

forced to blacken all of your windows.  T ell us a littlebit about that.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T he Rom anians thought theJews actually are signaling the pilots where to 

drop bom bs.  So they would leave a light, f or instance
, a candle light burning into a certain 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
22
 
room  so you could see it throughthe windows .  Now, theallies prim aril y tried to bomb the 
arm ies,the depots. T hey said the reason
 
--
 
what youhave todo, you have to black out or 
darkenthe window so no light would shine through sothe pilots couldn't see exactly where to 

drop their bombs. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And if  you didn'tdo that, thepenalties were severe.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Very severe.  Many tim es

the reasonthat the people obeyed, because what 
they did, they shot people on the street. They shotpeoplebecausethey didn'tobey the 
I r on

s' wishes.  People know. W e saw it. W e saw people getting killed infront ofm e. 
Becausefor whatever reason, they did som ething wrong.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So when you were in the bunker and you realized that these were Russian 

soldiers and eventually you came out,do youknow if  there was a sense of it really is over for 
us now or because there was still obviously w ar going on around you, afearthat the 
I r on  
Guard
 
o r  t he
 
Germ ans would, you know, counterattack and you would be right back in the 
sam e situation?  Do you know when there was a sense in your comm unity that, whew, we 

really are safe now? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:W hen the Russians cam e and all of a sudden we realized we
 
don't need 
rations anym ore, we can get whatever we wa nt.  Jobs were available to workf or the Russian 

arm ies. W e didn't see the 
Iron Guard
 
anym ore because mostof them  were either captured or 
ran away.  So all of a sudden we realized we can leave the ghetto without having the yellow 

star pinnedtoour chest and were ableto go to differentplaces. T hen we realized we were 
pretty m uch secure.

>> Bill Benson:  So the Russians were relatively decentto you? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Inthe beginning they were very 
decent.  T hey gave us f ood.  T hey did 
whatever they can.  Later on wef ound out under the Com munist regim e wasn't so great 
because the Russianswere anti
-
Sem ites aswell.  Although we wer e able to go to school,but 
children who were doing well in school were allowed to join the Comm unist young party or the 

youth, Com munist youth, which was called the pioneers.W ell, Jews couldnever 
join that club 
s
trictly because of the Jewish people.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  hoping we can talk a little m ore about that butat
 
some point yourf ather did 
return.  W ill 
you 
t e ll u
swhat you rem em ber about that?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Som epeople returned. T heones who were takenaway the same timemy 

father was takenaway, some said we saw yourf ather am onth agoor six weeks ago.  He 
wa s  
actually shipped closer west.  My f ather was a pretty strong individual.  So we thought labor 

probably wouldn't kill him , starvation would. So people said, well, we saw him  this such and 
such date.  So we know if you saw him  six weeks bef ore that, chances are we're probably 
going to seehim .  Andthat'show later on hem ade his way back to 
Ia s i
.  Obviously was ver y, 
ver y happy about that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e he literally just one day walked up.  Here he is.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Showed up.  T here was no com munication,obviously.  So we didn't know 

where he is.  He couldn't com municate with us. T he only comm unication was people that 
cam e backf rom  the sam eareathat had slave labor, they would come back and say, yes, we 
saw him  or we didn't see him .
  
Sothat was the only comm unication.

>> Bill Benson:  But he was there.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: He was there.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatabout hisbrot
he r s ?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Both brothers came back later on. And thenactually onebrother was able to 
leave Rom aniabef orewe did under the Comm unist regim e. And one stayed and never lef t, 
died in Romania.  He couldn't leave.  He couldn't leave Rom aniaat t
hat tim e anym ore.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atone point when the war wa s over and yourf ather is back, sounds like there 

is an attem pt to re
-
establish kindof  a norm al life, people getting jobs, tell us what your f ather 
did to get him self  reestablished atthat time.Andalso tell us at what point do
 
yo u
 
t h i n k t he 
enorm ity of the Holocaust really becam e known to your f am ily and to your community, wh ether 
you really knew
 w
hat had happened throughout Europe.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: First thing obviously we m oved out of the ghetto and got another house, 

another apartm ent. One day m y f ather said to me why don't we go back to thefarm and see 
what's happened with ourf arm . W e cam eback there, and what happened is the farm  was 
divided into four.  One of  the four
 
--
 
25% of  the 
f arm , oneof  thefourportions, the owner was 
the priest's brother
-
in
-
l a w.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he priest who denounced you.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Correct.  So we realized what thepriest did was actually somethingf inancially 

benef icial f or him .  And that's what he did.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

So thefarm ersthat actually helped, droppedoff  the sacks off oodf rom time totim e 
c a m e 
to  
us and said, 
ﬁ
I would recomm endthat you no longer com eback here because they're 
going to kill you.
ﬂ
  
Sowe never saw the farm again. T ill many, many ye
a rs  I f ile d  c la im s f or it .   
S t ill p e nd in g.  
 
 
So obviously there was no way of  going back 
to  
where we camef rom . So my father 
did whatever he was able to do.  Imm ediately he realized in 1947that this isnot aplacefor us 
to be anym ore.  So he tried
 
--
 
we
 
tried to leave.  But it was very hard to getexit 
vi s a
 
f ro m  
Rom ania under the Com munist regime.  Finally, later on he was able to bribe ahigh off icialto 

get anexit visa to Israel.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Until that point, because hecouldn't get hisfarm back, what did he doto be 

able tofeed afam ily and take care of afam ily?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Since he dealt with the 
Iron Guard
 
Arm y, hetried to make contacts with the 
Russian arm ies.  Did the sam e thing. Sohewould try to f igure outwa ys to actually deal w
it h  
these people. T hey were a captive audience pretty m uch.  He dealt with them for a while.  W e 

were able to gobackto school
 b
ut not really m uch else.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid you begin tofully grasp the losses to your own extendedf am ily and 

know the extent of the Holocaust? 
 
>> Na t S h aff ir: I t
hink it was probably m aybe six m onths later. Again, there's no phone calls, 
no individuals that camefrom  thisarea.  Started to know that Germ any invaded Hungary in 
March of 1944. Between April
 
15 and July
 
9,1944, 440,000 Jews were deportedf rom  
Hungary.  33 of these440,000 were part ofm y f am ily.  These 33 individuals, aunts,uncles, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
26
 
cousins, grandparents.  Som ost of them, theyoung ones andthe old ones, they were all 
shipped to Auschwitz a nd T reblinka
,  
to the gas cham bers.  Once they arri ved to Auschwit z, 
within si x hours these people were dead. The other ones were able to work.  The stronger 

ones were sent to slave labor camp. 
 
 
My grandfather and two of his sons,m y uncles, were workin g in a cam p. 
 
M y 
grandfather actually starved to death am onth before liberation by the Americans. T wo of his 
sons, two of m y uncles, survi ved.  One was 21 and one was 22 years old. They were sick.  
T here were m alnutritions.  Eachone weighed 65
 
pounds at age 22.  So
 
you can imagine what 
they looked like. 
 
 
W hat the people did at that point, they put them  on ships to send them  to Sweden to 
recuperate.  
Both ofmy uncles shipped to a sanatorium toSweden. Oneof  these two uncles 
diedon the way to Sweden.  Andonly one survi ved and eventually was able to im m igrateto 
the UnitedStates. That's when If ound out what happened tom y f amily. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of all that were deported, I think one returned.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:  T hat's the uncle that I m entioned, yeah. 
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson:  You and yourfam ily, as you began to tell us, lived thenunder the Comm unists 
until 1950, anotherf ive years.  Tell us a little bit m ore about what lifewas like f or you on the 

comm unists.  Obviously as you were saying yourf ather knew this was not aplace you could 
stay.  He was com pelled then totry tof indawa y to get you out.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: First of all, there was nom ore Jewish f reedom . Nofreedomof  religion. T he 

comm unists didnot believe in f reedom of  religion.  So if  youhad topray or go to synagogue, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

27
 
you hadto go prim arily to m ake surethat nobody sees you.
 
 
Again, the Russians them selves didn't do well for the Jewish people.  They did a lot 
of  things that people couldnot im agine, thataf ter the war was over people would still do 
certain things. T he 
I r on  G ua r d
, some of the top echelon officers, eventually were part of the 
governm ent of Rom ania.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So even thoughthey were fascists, they became part of  the Comm unist 
governm ent?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Correct.  [Inaudible] was oneof  them. W e know what he didf or the Jewis h 

people. So it was pretty tough, pretty hard.  Freedom of m ovem entwas ok, butnot toof ar.  
You couldn't go thatfar.  Schooling was ok, but, again, we were notincluded am ong the 
children.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:  You started to tell us earlier thatas you were doingwell in school but you 
were not able to join the activities that other students could participate in, there'sa pioneer 
program  you started to talk about.

I know m y younger sister was probably top in 
her class. I was notas good as she was.  I must have been third in the class. We were not 
allowed to jointhe pioneers. T hathurt a lotbecause we were looked down at.  Because these 
kids, because they're not part of pioneers

and thepioneers had a red scarf or a red tie 
identif ying them  asa Comm unist youth.  Since we did not walk around with that red scarf , they 

know that we aredumb or we didn't domuch, well, in school.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And the com bination of all of those things, yourf ather then begins to try to get

you out. How did he get you out? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: First he appliedfor exit 
vi s a
s.  Every tim e heapplied, the 
vi sa
s were denied
 f
o r 
various reasons. And then f inally he was able to bribe an off icial.  He gave us anexit visa.  
From  there we wentf rom  
I a si
, traveled tothe seaport of the 
B l ac k S
ea. There we waitedfor a 
ship to take usout. T he only way we were able to leave Romaniaatthatpoint was in a cargo 

ship.  I remember we actually
 
--
 
m ost of the people leaving there,there was a big hull where 
they carried grain or any other comm odities. That's where they took f romus Rom ania to 

Israel, took us approxim ately two weeks to get there. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  How did your father manageto get enough to bribe?
 

>> Nat Shaff ir: My m other still had som e jewelry
, s
om e of the cash.  That'sprobably how they 
were able tobribe the right people.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And I rem ember you telling me a little bitabout they hadone large woode
n 
trunk.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Right.  It's like when you go to camp. They build a large wooden trunk
a
nd in 
thereour possessions.  And the possessionswere blankets,pillows,  some things that today 
you wouldn't think were of any value.  But that's what we had. That's what we took.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas your possessions. W hat was it like to land in Israel?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: It was great.  First of all, thefreedom  that we had was enormous. Thef irst 
tim e I saw an orange. I never knew what oranges looked
 
like ortasted like. So once we got to 
Israel everything was pretty new and everything was great.  Schooling was f un.  You lived 

am ong Jewish people. Things were really gre at.
  
And thenm y father was able to do certain 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

things.  My m other becam e anurseagain. Things were good.  In Israel things were good.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your father gotback into thedairy business.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Correct.  And then he was dealing various things.  My f ather was an 
entrepreneur as well.  He always was able tom ake
 
money.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou were initiall y li ving in some very lim ited circumstances.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Once you arrive, you lived in an absorption center. T here we were able toget 
f rom  the state of Israel, ableto geta cot, a blanket. Food was
 
gi ven 
to  
you on adaily basis.  
You go in a certainarea where they had a dining room and kitchen. You get your foodf or the 

day.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said it was sort like a tent city.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T ent city.  Right.  T hen you get that. You take it
 
back to the tent.  Youmake 
do
 
with  th a t.
 

 
Again, m yf ather realized that'snota way to live as well.  So hetried to getoutof  
there. And later on we were shipped toanother location where we lived in British barracks, 

which was stonebarracks with m etal roof ings.  And thenthere we hadm aybe twof am iliesper 
barrack.  So we were able to
 
--
 
a littlem ore hum ane. People were sitting on their beds and 
eating.  My father,f irstthing hedid,he got som e woodtogether andm ade a table. Especially 

my moth
er, she always  wanted to makeeverything proper.  So instead of eating onthe bed, 
we'll have a table. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your dad was an incredible handy
 
man.  Made the table.

re m a rk
able enough that you were woundedand you'rehere with us today, but there'sanother 
twist to it, if you will, that I would like you to share with us.

>> Nat Shaff ir: A lot of people really didn't talk about it. W e knew that he was in slave labor 
cam p. W e saw whenhe arrived how skinny he was, knew he suff eredf rom m alnutrition. But 
he never really spokea lot about it.  Actually, recently m y 11th grandchild was bornand they

>> Na t S h aff ir: Af te r If
inished theArm y, I tried todo something.  I did not know what I wanted 
to do.  My uncle that survi ved the Holocaust livin g in the UnitedStates atthe time. I asked him  
if he wouldm ind sponsoring m e to com ef or a visit, to come asa visitor tothe United States.  
And he did
.  V
isited here f or a while
.  
I realized the potential of the UnitedStates
,  
what a great 
country it is.  Ieventually changed my visitor's visa to a
 
permanent resident.  
After tha t I 
eventually got m y G
reen 
C
ardand decided to stay. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'll take advantage of the question, though.  It wasn't as easy as that.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: No, it wasn't as easy as that.  First of  all,because Icame in as a visitor's visa, I 
hadto leave the country and com ebackagain.  Literally f or two weeks.  Come back again 
under diff erent visa
 a
sa requestfor perm anent resident. Ittookapproxim ately three years to

really a perm anent resident of the United States atthat time.

, a
 
young lady. 
 
>> You m entioned earlier that you were involved with the synagogue.  I was just wondering 
what you do. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Oh, we mentioned that youhad been the ExecutiveDirector of  the synagogue.
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:T heExecutive Director of thesynagogue.  That'spretty muchhandling the 
synagogue or thedaily activities, m anagement prim arily. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that was relatively recently.
 
 
Do we have other question? Right here.

they face their
 
own trials? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir:W ell, you need to be com m itted. If  you're comm itted enough, youprobably 

coulddo anything that you want to do. T he comm itment and stick to this commitm ent. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you.  I was going to ask you
 
--
 
I know that you've not returned to 
Rom ania. But you wer e considering it recently.  Can  you tell us a little bitabout that?
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yeah. My son Jeff, which is a colonel in the Reserves, hedoes a l
o t  of  t h ings  
with the European Armed Forces.  So he was in Macedonia a while back.  Must have beena 
couple of m onths ago,six monthsago.  He's involved with NAT O.  So he said, 
ﬁD
ad, how 
about m eet

andwe'll tra vel back to see where you gre w up.
ﬂ
  
Somehow 
--
 
it was a gr eat 
idea, but 
som ehow we couldn't m
anage time
wise.  But hopefully oneday I m ight still go back.  
Although, them em ories were so bad that Idon't lookforward to it. Som e people that went 

back thatI understandwere there, they said there's nothing really to see.  But nonetheless, the 
hous
es are still standing.  But them em ories were too badfor me to actually wanting to go 
b a ck.  

>> Bill Benson:  So itwould take some unique circum stances. 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: Yeah. But m aybem y kids will  one day take me to see

show them  where I 
was born, the year I was born.  Maybe they'll f igure itout.

thattoother Jews in the community?

these off icers and the guard pointing tous as

Nat's done, you can stay behindfor af ew m inutes to chat with anybody.  If  you have a 
question that you think I shouldhave asked or I'd just liketo say hi, Nat will be available to
 
do 
that.  So pleasedo that.  But I'm  also going to, when Nat'sf inished,ask you all to stand 

because Joel, our expert photographer, is going to com eupon stage and take a photo of Nat

Nat? 
 
>> Nat Shaff ir: I'd liketo leave you with a quotef rom  Martin Muellerwho said, "
F
irst they 
cam ef or thepeople,obviously the Nazis.  I did not speakout.  I was nota Nazi.  Then they 
cam ef or thetrade unions. I did not speakout because I was not a tradeunionm em ber. T hen 
they camef orthe Jews.  I did not speakoutbecause I was not a Jew.  T hen they cam ef or m e 
andnobody was lef t to speak outf orm e."   
 
 
My point is this. Every
 
one of us here knows som etimes at som epoint things are 
done wrong and we keep quiet.  It's very im portant we do not rem ain silent
b
ecause people 
that remain silent
