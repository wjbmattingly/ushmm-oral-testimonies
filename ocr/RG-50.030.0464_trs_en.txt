MICHAEL WERTMAN 
 March 20, 2002 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Michael. 
Answer: Good morning. 

Q: We lcome , welcome to the Wa shington area. 

A: Pleasure to be here. 

Q: Now, can you tell me  when you were born? 

A: Yes. I was born on a -- August the 30
th
, 1928. 
Q: And whe r e? 

A: In the city of L™vov. 

Q: And your name  was not Mich
ael Wertma n [indecipherable] 
A: No, it was not. 
Q: -- was it? 
A: Actually, I was born Abraham Wertman, but ne
ver called Abraham, neve
r, never and I tried 
to find out why, and I was never given a straight an
swer. It seems that some  distant relative that 
they honored, but my pa rents never called me  Abraham, my c a  -- I was called Mundek, M-u-n-d-

e-k, which is a nickname  mostly used by Polish Jews, you know, it™s not a typical Polish 

nickname , and it was Mundek, M-u-n-d-e-k, and 
that was my name , I was  known as Mundek. 
But I have a document to show -- actually, I receiv
ed a copy of my birth 
certificate in 1993 from 
the Polish authorities in Warsaw, and they had actu
ally -- were able to get a copy for me , so it 
did -- 

Q: And it said Mundek? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464

A: It says ab -- Abraham. 
Q: It says Abraham on it? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, indeed, yeah. 

Q: Oh, well that™s interesting. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Tell us a little bit about your 
-- your fa mily, your father -- 
A: Sure. 

Q: -- and your mother -- 

A: Sure. 

Q: -- during this period before the war. 

A: Before the war, yes. Well, I -- I had a ve
ry happy childhood. I was th
e -- my mother™s only 
child, and there were two other br
others, but they were half brot
hers whose mother died when 
she was very young, of a brain tumo r. But we were
 very, ve ry close, so I was never -- til about 
nine years of age, I wasn™t aware that they were 
not my real brothers, I mean I -- were on -- half -
- half brothers. And my fi -- so
 I was the only one who was born 
actually in L™vov. I was sort of 
the city born child. The others were born in smalle
r t --  in small towns a -- where my father came 
from. My fa ther was in the dairy business. 
We  had a small dairy plant where he would 
ma nufacture milk products like ch
eeses and heavy creams and butter 
and that sort of thing, and 
get up four in the morning to receive the m
ilk from the farms, and then produce it and 
ma nufacture it and also have a sm
all retail stor e as well. Hard 
work and -- and we also had a 
cousin living with us and I have a photo of th
e pl ace that I was born, I was able to obtain that, 
too.  

Q: Oh, that™s great.

A: And so I had a relative  -- very happy chil
dhood, until about -- when I was about eight years 
old, my parents divorced. 
Q: Now, can we go back -- let™s go back a little b
it be -- before then. You -- your father™s name  is 
Henry.  

A: Henry, which actually Chuna is the -- is the name  -- is the -- would be the n -- 

Q: The real name. 

A: -- the po -- the real  name. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yes, Henry is correct. 

Q: And you were close with your father? 

A: Yeah, very close, yeah.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: And my mother too, you -- I mean, you know, I ha
ve a very happy me mories of their -- of 
them -- of their marriage until -- un
til about the age of seven or eight when -- when things didn™t 
work out. 

Q: How would you describe 
this personality and your mother™s personality? 
A: We ll, let™s see. My father was a very hard
 working -- very, I would say authoritarian, sor -- 
you know, very disciplined, always concerne
d about -- about ma king a good living. A good 
provider. My mother was 10 years younger and shewas, I would say ma ybe a little more worldly 

than my father. And perhaps the 
trouble began when she felt that 
perhaps there was more to life 
than just  working an --  all the time, a
nd so difficulties deve
lo -- [indecipherable] 
Q: Did you feel that as a child
?  Did you feel the di fficulties?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
4 
 
 
A: I began to -- to see some  discord there, but 
I wasn™t that close, I was very young at the time , 
you know, and I guess I didn™t pay that much atten
tion, although I did feel there™s some  tension 
there and I would overhear argumen
ts, etcetera.Now my -- my mo
ther™s fa mily -- and she had 
three sisters and two brothers, li
ved in Danzig, which is Gdansk. Wa s a freest city of Danzig. 
And I reme mber she would take me  -- she took me
 once when I -- before the divorce and also 
after the divorce I stayed with her for about a year
 in Danzig cause she wa nted to have me  close 
by. And of c ourse, then the war intervene
d, and things went really bad, you know. 
Q: Wa s it difficult for you when they divorced? Was that a -- 

A: Wa s very difficult. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was difficult from the point of view that 
-- that my father was mi ddle class, fairly well-to-
do. My mot her was left penniless because under 
Polish law there was no 
division of property, 
anything like that, and -- and I didn™
t -- he did not really give her any -- give her much support at 
all, if any. [indecipherable] part 
of the other presumed feelings a
bout the divorce. So -- so I felt 
badly about it and my mother decided to leave me 
with my fa ther cause she felt that I could be 
cared for better in th
e -- you know, in the -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- with my father s --  
and the rest of the fa mily. 
Q: Did you then see her on a re
gular basis?  [indecipherable] 
A: I saw her from pi -- yes, I saw her from tim
e - -  while she was still in -- in L™vov, you know, 
until -- until close of the wa
r, you know [indecipherable] 
Q: And did she rema rry? 

A: She did not rema rry. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
5 
 
 
Q: She didn™t. 
A: No, she did not, but she went back to her sm
all town of Tarnogrod just after the -- 1939, war 
broke out, you know. 

Q: So how -- what was her name , her first name? 

A: Her name was -- was Leah, 
or what would be Lisa -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- in [indecipherable] 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And ma iden name  Tr uk, T-r-u-k. 

Q: Uh-huh. And how old was your older stepbrother? 

A: Okay, I had two. 

Q: Or how much older than you. You had two -- 

A: Seven years older, the mi ddle one a
nd then the other one 10 years older. 
Q: Uh-huh, and what was the -- the name s of the two boys? 

A: Okay, the -- one was Mo -- Moshe -- or 
Moses, and the oldest one was Mordechai. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And we called them Mordtku and Moshku was th
e -- was the nickname s in polan -- in Polish. 
Q: And even though there was such a big difference in age, we re you close? 

A: I was very, very close to mi  -- the mi ddle 
one, you know, the -- my next, we are very, very 
close. 

Q: Moshe, uh-huh. 

A: In fact, he always claime d that a -- that
 my mother was like a true mo ther to him.  
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
6 
 
 
A: She was -- because he was like five years old 
when his mo ther died. So we were very close 
and -- so it was a generally the pretty happy hom
e environment, and I was -- we were spoiled 
[indecipherable] 
Q: You were spoiled? 

A: I was spoiled. 

Q: Right. Was it a religious household? 

A: Not very, no. My father came from a very Or
thodox -- as most Jews of his generation. Back 
on [indecipherable] I don™t think he ever had 
any public school educa
tion, his education was 
ma inly in the Jewish, you know, s -- studies and so 
forth and -- and I have an early picture of him 
with [indecipherable] beard and ha
t, which I™ll show you later.  
Q: Right. 

A: So he was more of, I would say, 
more worldly, although -- excuse me . 
Q: Sure. 
A: We  did have a -- a kosher household, per se
, but my father shaved, you know, and he would 
go to services occasiona lly. But he was beginning to
 question himself the -- the -- the -- the real 
Orthodoxy. He -- he tried to be more modern, livi
ng in the big city, you know, feeling free from 
the constraints of his small town 
and close relatives that he lived with, so he felt more free to do 
that.  
Q: Do you reme mber celebrating holidays? 

A: Oh yes, indeed, yeah, we did, and my fath
er would -- on Friday night he would use -- you 
know, ma ke  a Kiddush, he had a good voice, which he was proud of, so he used it to full 

advantage, you know, to -- to sing a fancy, you know, Kiddush, and we had the usual chicken 

soups and --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
7 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- Gefilte fish, and all that sort of thing, a
nd he would ca -- take me  
occasionally to services, 
you know, and -- but -- but generally I don™t think 
-- I don™t reme mber him actually even using 
the daily prayer, the tefillin, you 
know, that you would use. I don™t th
ink he bothered with that, if 
I reme mber. So he was really going far -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- far away from the -- you know -- 

Q: So what was the Jewish commu -- were -- were you living amongst ma inly Jews, or was it 

fairly mi xed? 

A: Yes, I lived on a street called Pilnikarska,
 which was several apartment buildings, almost 
close to the center of the city, 
and we lived in a two story build
ing. The upper story was a set of 
rooms, and the business itself was downstairs, yo
u know with the little factory there. And there 
was actually a stable with a couple of horses becaus
e the mi lk was being picked up at the railroad 
station early in the morning, so we had a couple 
of workers there, we had also workers in the 
factory. And most of the neighbors 
on our street were Jewish, was 
fair -- heavily Jewish because 
L™vov actually had a population of 110,000. Actua
lly, later on it swel
led to oh -- to a 150,000 
more. So all a total population 
of 340, so it™s only one-third, 
you know, was the third largest 
Jewish community i-in Poland. So -- so that wa
s a very heavy population there. And so the kids 
that I would play with we re mostly Jewish, wi
 -- you know, and -- and inte
restingly also that -- 
which we™ll -- we™ll get back to late
r, when I begin to assume  a diffe
rent identity, is that actually 
my native language was Polish. I like -- like families toda y, you know, where the -- first 

generation, you know, they speak Po
lish, and their parents speak Ch
ine -- I mean peak -- speak 
English and the parents speak Chinese, or what
ever. We ll, I spoke Polish, and of course, my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
8 
 
 
parents spoke Yiddish. So I did understand everythi
ng they said, but I would always answer in 
Polish, which helped me  a lot later on, because
 my Polish was very, very good, and very clean 
and very native Polish, unlike ma ny others, who -- you know, from s maller towns, who did not 
have that -- that advantage. 

Q: Now was  this -- was this kind of thing fairly
 typical of the Jewish 
community, the kids were 
going to a public school, not a Jewish school? 

A: Public school, yes. 

Q: Right. 

A: That was typical ma ybe of
 the larger cities like L™vov. 
Q: Right. 

A: Not of the smaller communities so much. In the smaller co mmunities they may -- may have 

gone to some public school, but 
they would also go to the ch
eder, you know, to study, you know, 
the Talmud, and the -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- the [indecipherable] kind of thing. 

Q: And that -- and 
that you didn™t do? 
A: No, no, not at all, no, no. 

Q: Were there Jewish yo
uth groups in L™vov, or not? 
A: There were some  Jewish youth groups, I wa
s very young, I didn™t belong to any. My -- my 
brother did, you know, he was -- he belonged to or
ganization called Betar, which was -- which I 
was kind of a -- unhappy about as I gr e -- gr ow 
and understood because I was [indecipherable] to 
the right of center, you know, Jewish organization. 
But he was -- he belonged to Betar and -- and 
was fairly active in that. That wasn™t -- you know, 
they had some  unifor ms  of their own, all that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
9 
 
 
But that was early -- in the early
 stages, later on became much more difficult, even before the 
war, because  the -- there was a lot of -- obviously some  anti-Semitism that -- it was prevalent. 
And incidentally, L™vov also had 
a very, very high Ukrainian popul
ation. It was one third Jewish, 
one third Ukrainian, one th-third Polish. And L™vov 
being western Ukraine wa
s a cradle of -- of 
Ukrainian nationalism and was a -- a lot of animos
ity between the Poles, and the Ukra inian and 
the Jews. So the Jews basica
lly, a lot of the Jews had a 
-- had a kind of a double -- double 
wha mmy, they were obviously hated by the Ukrain
ians and of course, a lot of the Poles were 

also, you know, anti -- anti-Semites. So -- so 
that was a big problem for the L™vov Jewish 
population. 

Q: Did -- did you feel that
 as a child growing up? 
A: I felt it occasiona lly, in public school, wh
en someti mes a teacher would make some funny 

Jewish, you know, i mitating Jewish word
s, or -- or one of the kids 
would speak ma ybe a little bit 
of a what I would call a Jewish Polish, you know, he
 would kind of ma ke some  f-fun of that and 
all that, but generally I di d not 
feel a direct -- direct thing. 
I wa s never, you know, accosted or 
attacked or anything like that or  -- or  by -- by -- 
by other ki ds because we were pretty -- in a 

pretty heavily Jewish population 
where I -- where I lived, you know.  
Q: Right. And do you recall your brot
hers talking about that at a
ll?  Ha-having any experience? 
A: We ll -- we ll, there were restrictions in ge
tting to a higher education. You know, there were 
quotas involved and all that, and so my brot
her went to -- to a -- 
a commerce high school, you 
know, tried to get a degree there, an
d that didn™t last very long, but
 my father -- my brother never 
mentioned any -- any overt or di rect confrontations as such, because again, the Jewish 

community, even though it wasn™t a modern city 
like L™vov, was still very, 
very closely knit, you 
know, and there was very little interaction, except 
for the -- some  the servants that would work, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
10 
 
 
or some  wor kers that would come  to work, etcetera
. So that was a -- a -- socially fairly isolated, I 
would say. 
Q: Would you have called yourself 
upper mi ddle class, do you think? 
A: I would say mi ddle class, ma ybe not upper, 
but mi ddle. Certainly comfortably mi ddle, not 
upper. 

Q: How -- how did you find out th
at your parents were going to 
get divorced?  Did your mother 
come  to you, your father come  to you, or they just -- 

A: We ll, I knew -- I knew that ther e were diffi
culties, I knew there were problems, and I knew 
when my mother took me with her to Danzig, to 
Gdansk, I knew that I -- 
that things were wrong, 
things were bad. My mo ther never told me  dir
ectly that she was -- that she was going to be 
divorced, so sh -- but I found out si -- very shortly 
after, especially when my father began to look 
for another -- for a new compani
on, you know, to -- to try to rema rry. 
Q: Did you resent that? 
A: Well, I did resent it to some degree, because 
he  never told me  that he would do that, and he 
ma rried a woma n who a c tually was a 
housekeeper, was 22 years younger than -- 
Q: Wo w. 
A: -- he, and that was very, very hard. Tha-that -- I 
resented that he never told -- told us that, he 
came one day, left with her, and then he came 
back and says, ﬁWell, meet your new mother.ﬂ 
You know. 

Q: Really? 

A: Y-Yeah. Which was very, very 
hard, that was -- that was very 
hard, and -- and also the fact 

that he wouldn™t support my moth
er, that -- that -- that --  
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
11 
 
 
A: -- that both -- that hurt, because I was livi
ng in a fairly comfortable household, and yet my 
mother was in a very small apartment, she had to 
-- she tried to do some  physical therapy to earn 
a living. So that was very, very hard. Yea
h, I -- I kind of never forgave him for that. 
Q: Right. And I guess your older 
brothers also felt similarly. 
A: Oh very much so, because he really
 was very close to my mother, you know. 
Q: Right. 
A: My -- the oldest br othe r was -- I wasn™t very cl
ose to him because he wa s a little bit, I would 
say what you mi ght call today, 
learning disadvantaged, or slow
 learning. Mordechai. And he 
basically helped my father in th 
-- in -- in the -- in 
the shop and in the s -- 
business. So I wasn™t 
that close to him, even though he 
was a very gentle soul, I didn™t have much to do with him, per 
se. But with Moshe who is now George, we were 
-- we were close, yeah, we quite often slept 
together, and you know, in the -- and of course our
 house -- our home was  always full of visitors 
because you know, the big city. They would come from the small shtetl as it were, you know, 
and -- and visit the big city, you know, that was a bi
g thing for them. So we had visitors because 
my -- my father had four brothers and one 
sister, spread in ma ny places in Poland. None 
survived, incidentally. 
Q: None?  

A: None, none, n-nor their families.  

Q: Wo w. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So your mother leaves wh
en?  You think it™s 1937?  1936 -- 
A: By 1936 --  

Q: -- or ™37? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
12 
 
 
A: -- I -- ther e™s [indecipherable] she -- that ™s wh
en they were divorced 
and [indecipherable] and 
she went -- 
Q: So you™re like seven 
years old? Six, seven? 
A: Yeah well, she was born in -- in 1
905, so she was about 30 -- 31 - 32 years old. 
Q: And you keep in touch with her 
until ™39, or ™41, at -- at whi -- 
A: No, no, actually, actually -- 
actually, til about 1940 - ™41 b
ecause under the -- as you ma y 
recall, in 1939, when Hitler attack
ed Poland, the Germans we re on the outskirts, close to L™vov -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and we fully expected them to come , a
nd then overnight, all of a sudden you see the 
Russians are here. So from 1939 to ™41 -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- we were under theSoviets [indecipherable] 

Q: And was that a big change for your life? 
A: Oh, enormous change -- 
Q: Enormous change. 

A: Enormous change. 

Q: And how -- can you say -- 

A: Personally, through myself, it was -- well, the cha
nge was that first of all my father lost his 
business because the Russian -- there was no priv
at e enterprise allowed, so that -- so ac -- 
everything was expropriated. All the 
-- all -- you know, so my father 
lost -- they did allow us to 
stay in the apartment, which was -- which was 
in a way unusual, because [indecipherable] they 
would chase you out. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
13 
 
 
A: And my fatherlosteveryt
hing, you know, he lost his busine
ss, they took away everything 
from hi m, and they even searched the apartment to see whether there™s any -- any mo nies or 
valuables, or whatever, they would appropriate
, because to them that was the you -- you know, 
they were called the -- the kul
ogs, you know, the exploiters of the ma sses. Fortunately, the 
workers actually did say that -- they did speak 
we ll of my father. So that helped, you know, in 
some  ways. But he lost it. So from -- so that wa
s a -- a -- obviously
 a total loss, and -- and then 
my father tried to ma ke a living, you know, or bl
ack ma rket was a -- was the -- was the thing to 
do to try to, you know, scrape up a living and 
get a work permit, everybody had to work, you 
know, my -- my brother worked for the railroad do
ing some  -- he was me c hanically inclined so 

he did some  locomotive repairs, and -- and I we
nt to school, you know, I 
went to -- to a school 
and -- and then I -- all of a sudden the -- the Uk
raine became the foreign language. Incidentally, 
before the wa r, before 1939, the foreign langua
ge was German, ironicall
y, and the reason why it 
was German is because for Poland, German wa
s a very important language because it was a 
language of science, of technology, which Pola
nd always lacked. You know, like tools and 
imple ments and machinery was -- was always 
in German. Moreover, L™ vov itself was under 
Austria for 150 years, so there was a lot of Ger man influence in the -- in the -- in that area, too. 

In fact, L™vov was known as Lemberg, in Germ
a n. And in Yiddish always Lemberg, you know, 
for the Yiddish speaking. Like I would refer it 
to L™wow, whi c h is the Polish way of saying 
L™wow, L-w-o-w. But my father
 would always say Lemberg. 
Q: Lemberg. 

A: Yeah, right. So -- but then when this -- wh
en the Russians took over th
at part of Poland, we 
went to school and instead 
of Ger man, it was Ukrainian. 
Q: So you were speaking German in school? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
14 
 
 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: As a language of -- 

A: That was -- that was the foreign language 
that we were taught. No, no, Polish was the 
language. 

Q: Uh-huh, I see, okay. 

A: But we started early on [indecipherable] on 
a pla -- you know. He -- we started actually in 
grade four we started already a foreign la
nguage, and that was German, was the foreign 
language. 

Q: So now the foreign language was Ukrainian? 

A: Wa -- was Ukrainian, the -- the [indeciphera
bl e]. So Ukrainian because  that be came the 
Ukrainian Soviet Republic, you know, from 1939 to ™41. 

Q: Right. And was this -- was this harsh for you
?  I mean, the fact that your father loses his 
business, that means there™s much less money comi ng in. 
A: Oh sure. 
Q: So your life changes in a radical way. 

A: It™s change -- changed -- i-it ch
anged in a way that -- that -- th
at we were not sure of food, but 
-- but we -- but there was no extr
avagance, there was no -- we had to
 kind of pull in a little bit, 
but my father was very, very entrepreneurial and 
very adept in -- in scraping things up and so 
forth and got very into -- into doing all kinds of 
things. So we were not really that badly off, 
actually. We ™ll ma nage to -- to -- you know, to 
live fairly comfortably, fairly comfortably. 

Q: And his second -- well, his third wi fe now. 

A: Yes. 

Q: What™s her name? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
15 
 
 
A: Eugenia, Genya, Eugenia. 
Q: Eugenia -- you -- do you then become  some what
 clo -- I mean, was she 
nice to you, as kids? 
A: We had big problems. 

Q: You had big problems. 

A: Because she was only about five years olde r 
than my brother. And being -- and being -- and 
being a housekeeper, you know, whe n you™re young, 
you -- you don™t have that
 sense of -- of -- 
of -- of appreciation, of -- of a new role that --
 that some one assume d, especially with my mother 
still alive, and to be 
told here™s a new mother
, you know, i-is -- is kind of -- is hard. And she 
came from a very small town in the pro -- in prov
inces, and -- and she trie
d to please my father 
by being very frugal, you know, to my father, the epitome  of -- of womanhood was to be a good 

housekeeper, and you know, a good -- a good -- frugal housekeeper and of course a very devoted 

wife, you know, and so he didn™t ask us whether we would -- what we woul
d th-think about her, 
you know, being the new -- the new lady of the home , 
as it we re. He just decided to do it, that 
was his way of doing things. So we had some
 -- we had real problems with that, you know, 
serious -- 

Q: And it probably was difficult for her, t
hough you would not necessarily have known that, 
because she™s walking into this -- 

A: Right, sure. And she, of course, tried to 
assume  authority, you know, she trying to assert 
herself now that she assume d that role from a hous
ekeeper or servant to th
e actual lady to the -- 
to the -- of the household, you know, to be in charge 
of it and so forth. So it 
-- she tr -- had to -- 
you know, and so it just didn™t me sh 
at all, didn™t me sh, you know. 
It was not -- it was that lack 
of sensitivity and -- perhaps on both parts, although we were kind of blaming her because she 

was the adult and we were the kids --

Q: Sure. 
A: -- you know, so we kind of expected, perhaps her,
 to -- to understand the 
situation better, but -
- 

Q: And even more so your father. 

A: Yes, indeed. We ll, my father was totally
 becomi ng detached from it, you know, so -- 
Q: Wa s he an affectionate ma n?  

A: To very young children, yes. Very much so, 
when we we re very, very young, he was very 
affectionate. When we got ol
der, not so much, you know. 
Q: I see. 

A: We  were more of a -- his favorite expres
sion would be, what did you accomplish today?  You 
know, at the end of the day that was -- that was 
his way of -- of ma - maki
ng sure that you -- that 
you were hard working and responsible and all th
at, you know, and -- and it™
s -- it™s a tough life, 
you know, that was his -- his way. And of course
 he did come from a very modest background. 
And so in one way, you know -- but he didn™t have
 that balance, you know, he didn™t have that 
balance, but -- but he loved music, you know, 
he had a good voice, he -- he was very, very 

intelligent, very bright . He knew the Scriptur es
 really well, he  knew the Talmud inside out, you 
know. His favorite oc-occupation was to get into 
some -- some dialog with some -- some rabbis 
you know, to show off his own knowledge of it, and -- a
nd find some  faults or 
errors in their -- in 
their knowledge, you know, of it. So that was one of his favorite pa -- you know, things that he 

would -- and he read a lot, Jewish newspapers 
and so -- but no, he was very good to me  when I 
was very, very young. He™d always have some  candy 
in his pocket and all that. But then when I 

was -- and -- and I was the only child of -- of my
 mother so he kind of doted on me . But -- but 
that was when I was very, very young.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464

Q: And so when would it stop, when you™re four or five? 
A: We ll no, no, no, it stopped later on, much -- 

Q: [indecipherable] earlier -- oh, later. Oh, oh. 

A: -- much later, much late
r, yeah. Much later, yeah. 

Q: So during these two -- ™39 
until ™41 when Germany attacks and -- and occupies L™ vov. 

A: Right. 

Q: Do you begin, even as a young person, to hear what™s going on -- 

A: Oh, oh, absolutely. 

Q: -- elsewhere and -- 

A: Well, let me give you a -- give you a -- it 
come s back to me . In 1939 when -- when Germany -
- I think it was in June 22
nd
 when they attack, and then by the end of the month they we re -- they 
actually were in -- I™m sorry -- I™m sorry. In Se
ptember, I -- I want to go back. In September 
when -- when the Germans attacked Poland, and th
ey were on the outskirts of [indecipherable] 
we were fully prepared for the -- for the Ge
rmans to arrive, you know?  And then the Russians 
came overnight, and they came with this huge, h
uge tanks, tore up the 
streets, you know, the 
cobblestones, and the overhead electrical for 
the -- you know, for streetcars, and because they 
had these -- these lumbe r ing, monstrous tanks. So 
-- so that was our firs
t encounter with them. 
And -- and things have changed, you know?  Now, 
we became  very soon aware of the problems. 
We already heard obviously before
 -- before the -- the -- the 
-- you know, bef -- before this 
whole thing happened, all the problems of the war,
 and th -- obviously in the attack on Poland. 
As you know, it was their -- their German blitz
krieg, which is a light ning war, with the 
chivalrous Polish cavalry attacking German ta
nks, you know, which was -- that was one of the 
things that was so sad, you know, they
 just didn™t -- they -- they
 -- just they couldn™t fight the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
18 
 
 
Germans at all, I mean they were just -- and 
so we had ma ny, ma ny refuge es in L™vov. In fact 
our house was full of refugees. We  had one time -- there was my -- my -- my brother™s mother™s 
family. I reme mber that one time there was a fam
ily with six children cou -- staying with us in 
our -- in our home  as refugees. 
And there were -- at one time , I 
think the record showed that 
there was like a -- ma ybe a hundred thousand Jews th
at actually mi grated 
or escaped from the -- 
from the other side into -- into L™ vov, you know. 
And one of the ironies of war, which ma y be 
not that well known, is that those refugees who 
came to L™vov, desperately tried to stay in L™vov. 
They wanted to stay at L™vov under the -- you k
now, because they felt they ma y be s a fe under 
the Russians. But the Russians issued an edict 
that any Jew who did not
 -- was not a resident 
prior to 1939, had to be evacuate
d, ha d to leave. So they forcefully evacuated thousands and 
thousands of Jews from L™vov to the far 
east of Russia. And 
these survived -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- you see. And yet ma ny of them desperately trie
d -- they we -- tried to 
bribe authorities, they 
tried to get false papers and all 
that. And that didn™t work at a
ll, I mean, the Russians were very, 
very strict. And I recall my fath
er sending parcels to 
these relatives that were actually, you know, 
taking ba -- taking it to -- to Ru
ssia, and these actually survive
d. And I reme mber them after the 
war, you know, that they actually survived. So -- so
 there™s one of those ironies, if you will, of 
the war that people that didn™t know
 what to do, with so muc h c
onfusion and so forth and they 
actually survived, and the native, or th
e local people perished [indecipherable]

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Michael, let™s -- let m -- let me go back to
 my last question. Wh
- When the Russians have 
occupied L™vov, do you hear what™s going on in 
the German occupied part of Poland? 
A: We -- we -- we heard -- 
Q: [indecipherable]  

A: -- we heard from the -- from those  refugees and 
we also heard of just 
-- just generally about -- 
about some  of the atrocities, of course, or that
 -- you know, and from the 
-- the ghettos and -- and 
some  of the killings and so forth. But not, at that 
point we were not aware of the full extent of the 
Holocaust in terms of the -- of the crematoria
 and the -- and the ma ss slaughter. And the -- at 
least I did not personally hear th
at, or was aware of it. We  were
 -- we knew that the Germans 
were definitely destroying the Jewi
sh people, I mean there -- there 
were -- that -- that we knew, 
that we knew that they were -- they had basicall
y a -- a -- a policy if you w
ill, or an active policy 
of -- of -- 
Q: So you thought that then, that they were -- because they we ren™t killing Jews en masse -- 
A: No, they were not. 

Q: -- until ™41 -- 

A: But they were -- but they we
re already -- they -- there was wa
nton, there was lot of wanton -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- killings. 

Q: Right. 

A: There were some  of t hese pogroms as it were, you know -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
20 
 
 
A: -- although -- although the pogrom
s were mo re -- a more part of
 the eastern part of Poland, 
you know, peop -- you know, and so forth, because of
 the history of pogroms. But we did know 
about -- about the -- all the rest
rictions, you know, on the -- and th
e yellow stars and the -- and 
taking, you know, property confiscations, you know
. Don™t forget Kristallnacht was the 
beginning in Germany of it, you kno
w, the -- the -- the -- 
you know -- we knew that -- that -- that 
the Jews were not losson -- you know, busine
sses, you know, with othe
r, you know, properties 
were taken away. So we knew there 
was a definite move me nt , if you will, to rest rict, to -- to -- to 
dimi nish, to -- you know, to -- not so much perhap
s annihilate in terms 
of a -- of the final 
solution, you know, [indecipherable] you know, the fina
l solution as it were. But certainly we w -
- we knew that and we dreaded that. And we -- we
 -- we -- you know, we kne
w that -- that it was 
getting worse and worse.  
Q: So were you frightened as a chi -- I mean,by this time, when the Russians take over, you™re 

nine years old, about nine
 years old. And then -- 
A: We ll, in 1939 I was 11 years old. I was born in ™28. 

Q: ™28, okay.  

A: Right. 

Q: So you were 11. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you hear things from other kids?  Ar
e you frightened yourself?  Are you having bad 
dreams? 

A: We ll, we -- we -- I wasn™t frightened myself and I didn™t have bad dreams, although because 

at that time , in the begi nning, in 1939 when th
is -- when this partition took place, we didn™t 
actually know what would happen. We
 did not believe that it would 
last. We  -- we knew that this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
21 
 
 
was ma ybe just a -- because my father woul
d ma ke comments. You know, we had this short 
wave radio -- radio, and -- and 
wasn™t -- was mi ddle waves, actu
ally, and we listened to BBC, 
right, London, this is London calling, you know. A
nd we had all these -- you know, and also 
there was an émigré Polish government in -- in 
London, so there were some  Polish broadcasts as 
well. A -- so we heard commentaries about that 
fact that there™s -- you 
know, there™s -- there™s 
ma ybe just a -- a pause for the Germans, you know, th
at this was not going to last. We  -- in fact, 
we didn™t believe it. Wh en it happ
ened, it was a -- just a total 
surprise, seeing Russians in L™vov 
was just -- because we fully expected the German
s to -- to arrive. And of course there was also 
the gener -- still a disbelief that the Ge rmans would go that far, you know. We  thought that 
perhaps this was a -- a -- a temporary prob -- you 
know, thing that the Germans were -- were 
revenged themselves because of the Versailles 
Tr eaty of the first World War, you know, because 

they felt they were mi streated by 
the allies, and -- and they trying 
to use the Jews as scapegoats, 
and of course that -- and there™
s always this history of Jewish
 persecution and -- and sc -- so 
there was this mi xed feeling because -- because th
e feeling was that the 
Germans with that high 
culture, with that 
-- with a tremendous contribution to civilization, how could they possibly be -- 
be prone to -- to -- to -- to do that, you know, 
to really try to destroy 
a people. We  just thought 
that this was ma ybe part of the ove
rall war effort as it were, and th
e Jews were considered also as 
being communists, you know, a lot of Jews belonged
 to the left or -- you know, socialists an -- 
organizations, so the Germans ma y have been using 
this as an excuse to 
-- you know, to restrict 
and confine the Jews and so forth, an
d using that as a -- as a -- as 
a -- as a co -- so there were a 
lot of mi xed, mi xed feelings. There was -- ther
e was still a kind of a -- the way I remember 
hearing adults talk -- I me -- I 
-- obviously I was too young to partic
ipate, is that there was a kind 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
22 
 
 
of a disbelief that -- that this was going to get 
that much -- much worse, you know, that this was 
ma ybe part of the overall war situa
tion as it were, until a little later. 
Q: Yes, but was there an exp
ectation that the Germans woul
d attack, or did you think the 
Russians are here and 
that™s going to -- 
A: Well, I -- I think there was an -- for the --  fo
r a -- for awhile there was a mi xed bag, but with 
the German successes in the west, you know, when 
they overran all of Europe practically, okay, 
and also with the -- with the London, you know, b
litz, too, and all that, 
and knowing the history 
of the relationship between Germany and Russi
a you know, and -- and -- and knowing the -- the 
-- the Germa n ne -- expansionism and need -- need
ing the Ukraine as -- as
 their breadbasket, you 
know, to -- to f -- fuel the war effort. The feeli
ng was that this ma y -- mi
ght not last it, you know, 
I mean. Wh en and how we didn™t know, of course, you know. 

Q: Were you listening to the ra
dio broadcasts as we -- 
A: I was -- I would listen to -- oh yeah, I was very
 curious, to me  that was a -- it was like, you 
know, the war was almost like a -- you know, to
 -- to hear a f -- broadcast all the way 
[indecipherable] oh, we™re all kind of around the ra
dio, yeah, sure. And some  of it we -- were 
also concerns because the Russian didn™t like 
it, you know, we had to be careful about that. 
Q: But they didn™t confiscate the radio? 

A: No, they didn™t, no. No, no. I don™t whether they
 -- actually whether we had the radio at the 
time when they -- you know, the confiscated busi
ness, or whether my fa ther acquired one. I™m 

not sure, but we -- I know we did have one.  

Q: And wha t  about newspapers, did you 
read newspapers?  Were there any? 
A: There were -- no, there was Ukrainian newspa
pers. Yiddish newspapers were eventually -- 
they were published later on, but obviously with
 their -- with a Sovi
et tinge, as it were. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
23 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Cause the Russian actually did allow native 
languages, you know, in -- 
in their republics and 
all that. 

Q: Right. 

A: Although -- as long as the offi
cial language was Russian or Uk
rainian, they did. So there was 
no restriction per se interms of -- of that, you know. But of 
course the old -- the old newspapers 
were all gone, you know, that -- th
at my father would read and 
so forth. But my father was -- 
could read Polish very well, you know, and he was 
actually quite -- quite flue
nt in -- in his own 
way, you know, with -- with the Polish language. 

Q: An-And how was school during these c
ouple of years before the Germans -- 
A: We ll, the -- the school is basi
cally an indoctrination into th
e Soviet system. You know, the 
young kids were all asked to be pioneers, 
you know, and -- and -- a
nd, you know, you are the 
future and we are blah, blah, you know, and allthat typical Soviet propaganda. And the quality 
was not b -- as far as education itself, it wasn
™t bad, you know, the usual 
subjects, the geometry, 
the -- the algebra and -- and all th
at, you know, and so -- but there 
was this -- this constant -- you 
know, always we had th -- the constant propaganda 
was always there, and of
 course the city was 
full of -- of -- as you know, of posters of Stalin
 and -- and then the, you know, workers of the 
world uni -- wer -- unite, you know
 and that type of thing, you 
know, that™s o -- you saw it all 
over. They were very good at that, you know, th
ere were banners all over the pl ace, you know, in 
there. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
24 
 
 
A: And the Russians always tried to be nice to 
the children because th
at was part of their 
propaganda, so they were very friendly, they -- 
they were -- the soldiers would talk to the 
children, you know 
Q: Really? 

A: Oh yes, they were very, very friendly, they 
tried to -- especially to
 children, you know, they 
were -- they were always very friendly to childr
en, so -- but -- but of cour
se the Poles, and -- had 
not much, you know, much love for the Russians 
obviously, they always ma ke -- ma de fun of 

their primitive, you know, culture, as 
it were. Not so much culture, but 
that -- their -- their social 
ril -- you know, activi
ties and the -- and the sanitation and 
all that kind of stuff, you know. The 
Polish all --  Poles always felt superior to the -- 

Q: To the Russians. 

A: -- to the Russians, yeah. 

Q: Did you like these Russians, the Russian
 soldiers, and the Russians that you -- 
A: We ll, I didn™t really sort 
of -- I was curious about them
, you know. I did like the Russian 
language, because we also took Russian. 

Q: Right. 

A: But -- but what I did like, incidentally, was kind
 of interest ing is that  the -- that the Russians 
liked opera very much, you know, and they had tran
slations of classical 
operas in Russian. And I 
reme mber we went s -- once wents -- went to th
e Russian opera -- I mea
n, to the -- to the L™vov 
opera house for a performa nce, I believe it wa
s ﬁAida,ﬂ if I™m not mi staken, in Russian, you 
know, because the Russians liked to listen to operas in
 translation, not in the 
original. So that was 
kind of impr essive, that part of 
it, but -- but of course for my fa
ther and for his generation was -- 
was tough. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
25 
 
 
Q: Was tough. 
A: I mean, to lose your business, you know, to lo
se your livelihood and all 
that was -- was very -
- it was hard. But based on the -- 
on the refugees and their comment
s, was -- we were pretty -- 
pretty well off, you know, as far as we could -- 
they -- they lost everything, you know, they just -
- everything. 

Q: So when June ™41 happens, when you -- when the Germans attacked -- 

A: We ll the end of June, July, you know, of course 
the -- the Russians left  and my oldest brother 
Mordechai was drafted. The Russians took him w
ith them and he never came back, we never 
heard from him. Of course that wa
s -- that was, of course a -- th
at was very frightening when the 
Germans arrived, you know, with their armor, you know, and with their -- I mean, they were by 

comparison to the Russians they looked like 25
th
 century as opposed to
 middle ages, you know, 
in terms of t heir armor, and in terms  of their 
-- their -- the power that was overwhelming, it was 
actually frightening. I reme mber s
eeing them as they entered the 
city, you know, and they -- with 
their sidecar motorcycles,
 with their heavy breastplates, you k
now, with their -- when their what 
do you call, huge helmets, you know, with those big 
helmets. We called them reverse urinals, 
you know, when we -- when we saw those. 

Q: Did you see them outside, or 
were you s -- insi
de the house? 
A: Oh, right in the city. 

Q: You -- you were standing outside 

A: Well, no, I mean, I was next -- next -- the -- 
you know, the ma in street 
was just about a half a 
block away. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
26 
 
 
A: So -- so that was -- that was re
ally frightening. That was really
 -- that was sort of the -- just 
incredible, it was -- it was a very -- a fri
ghtening sight, you know, I 
mean, not just a -- I 
reme mber that vividly and -- and of course w
ithin days, you know, this 
-- everything started in 
terms of the -- 
Q: The pogroms started. 

A: -- of the Jews, you know, and -- in fact, the 
pogroms started right away, as you know, because 
the Ukrainians blamed the Jews for the -- for 
some of their prisoners who were -- who were 
killed by the -- by the Russians, by the NKVD, bu t 
they blame d the Jews for it. Any kind of 
excuse and -- and the Ukrainian nationalists -- 
not all Ukrainians, but th
e Ukrainian nationalists 
were encouraged, of course, by the Ge rmans and they became very willing collaborators and 

police and everything and thousands
 of Jews were imme diately ki
lled, and -- and by I think was 
July 15
th
, we had to wear armbands. So the Germ
ans had very good experience, two years of 
experience of dealing with Jews, so they didn™t 
waste any time at all, in terms of their --  
Q: Do you reme mber these early pogroms, because when they come  into the city, within da ys 

there™ s the Petlura Aktion. 

A: Oh I -- oh sure, wi -- Petlura and then -- 
and Pandera, I -- I reme mber -- I remember the -- 

heard the shooting, and the -- in fact, there was th
e -- they destroyed -- there was a -- right ne-
near us there was a temple called Stary Rynek 
in the old -- the old ma rketplace, and that was 
destroyed and -- and there were t
housand -- thousands of Jews at 
that time  were leaving. There 
was like a -- a real rampage of a -- a vi
cious -- vicious killing and so forth. 
Q: And whe r e were you -- were you hiding 
in the house, I me an, what was the -- 

A: We ll, we were in the house, you know, they -- 
they -- they were actually picking up people 
from the street -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
27 
 
 
Q: Street. 
A: -- they didn™t go from house to house as suc
h, but there was plenty of -- reme mber, with 
110,000 Jews, I mean, like every third person Jewish, it 
wasn™t hard for them to -- to pick out the 
Jews, you know, and so that was -- that was a -- a 
very -- quite a shock a
nd very trauma tic. Even 
-- even -- even from the -- from -- from a 
viewpoint of a -- of a young boy like myself, you 
know, I was only at that time , 
what, 1941 I was 13 years old. I 
-- I was overwhelme d by that, you 
know. It was that -- that fear, 
you know, was -- was very palpable. 
Q: Has your sister been born by now? 

A: Yes, she was born -- Helen was born right 
-- soon after the Germans came, you know, and 
that was a -- like a late, very
 late child of my fat her. Course, Genya, she was young enough to 
have one -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- and she was born, yes, which wa
s kind of difficult, too, and -- 
Q: I would imagine during that period -- 
A: I know, was very difficult, very, very hard. A
nd so we just expected the worst, you know, we 
just didn™t know what to 
do. We  were trapped and -- 

Q: And Moshe is still home
 -- George is still home ?  
A: Okay, now George is -- Ge
orge is still home, but -- 
Q: But he -- 

A: -- but -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- about two months later he was -- there we
re -- there were all kinds of round-ups, you know, 
for -- for young Jews as workers, and he was caught 
in one of those round-
ups and was told that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
28 
 
 
they just needed him for a couple of hours to 
do some  work. And he ended up in a camp in 
Wi nniki, which was a suburb of L™
vov, where he spent over two year
s in -- in the -- in this, 
which was a -- like a concentration camp, actuall
y a forced labor camp. And he had a very tough 
time with that, you know, he -- so he -- he was 
never in the -- in the ghetto, you know, because 
the ghetto didn™t open til Nove mber, is when th
ey opened the ghetto and herded everybody into 
the ghetto. So he was -- and ironically that was 
done -- I think it was th
e Jewish police that -- 
cause they didn™t know, they were
 just told to s -- you know, we
 need some  workers, you know, 
for a few hours and so he ended up in the camp. 
Q: How did you find out that he was -- 

A: Oh, we had contacts, you know, there stil
l we -- how do I find -- how do we find out? 
Q: How did you find out that he
 was sent to this camp?  
A: Oh, because we a -- we hear -- he  let out wo
rd, you know, by a -- for mothers that -- that were 

still -- the ghetto was still open. In fact, I was ab
le to even bring him some food. He was this -- 
the camp consisted of about -- ma le only, but of
 -- about 250 approxima tely, inmates in that 
camp. And they were doing roadwork, they were 
in a quarry, breaking stones ma nually for road 
building. So the ghetto was still ope
n and I was able to get out of the ghetto and bring him some  
food, and also actually was one oth -- one -- 
one time I actually went into his camp, I was 
allowed to go inside. I think one 
of the -- this was in the early st
ages, one of the Ukrainian guards 
let me in. So I reme mber seeing the -- the -- ac
tually the insi de of the camp with the ter -- 
Q: So is he picked up before the ghetto? 

A: Before the ghetto. 

Q: Before the ghetto. 

A: Before the ghetto.

Q: So -- 
A: Before November, it was like -- 

Q: Right. [indecipherable] September. 

A: He was picked up ma ybe like in Se ptember. 

Q: Right. 

A: [indecipherable] July, August, yeah, a coupl
e of months after -- af
ter the Germans came. 
Q: So that must have been an additional fri
ght, I mean, because everyt hing is star ting to fall 
apart. 

A: Oh absolutely, oh yes, oh yes indeed. It was a 
-- it was just -- just -- yeah, like the world was 
comi ng to an end, you know, I mean it was tota
l, total -- was chaos,
 you know, people don™t 
know what to do. The -- the Germans required tri
bute, you know, of moni
es, and gold, and so 
forth, and they established this Jewish council 
called the Judenrat, you kn
ow, through whom they 
channeled the -- all 
their dema nds. And of course, the Judenr
at hoped that they would be a buffer 
to help, you know, mitigate some  of
 these things, and so -- and then in November is when we 
started to go into the ghetto, a
nd they gave us [indecipherable] 
a deadline of 30 days or 35 days, 
but they extended that because they just coul dn™
t ma nage to get everybody in that they -- and 
then on the way to the ghetto, they would pick 
out older people. I reme mber an incident -- and 
these things come to mi nd as you -- as you sp
eak, is that my brother™s, Moshe George, 
grandmother was with us at that time , and we we
re crossing a bridge on Pe
ltewna Street  into the 
ghetto, and what they were doing is they were 
picking out old people, 
or frail people and 
wouldn™t even let them into the 
ghetto, they just took them out a
nd -- took them away and shot 
them. So I -- so I have this grandmother put a kerc
hief on and I was talking 
to her in Ukrainian as 
we were crossing, as we walk -- 
because there was a lot of traffi
c back and forth. And of course, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
30 
 
 
I was blonde and blue eyed, didn™t look Jewish at all. So I spoke to
 her in Ukrainian and we were 
-- we just crossed, you know, I mean
 they didn™t pay attention to 
us because there was so much 
move me nt, so I was able to get her into the ghe
tto and she subsequently died a natural death 
while in the ghetto. So -- 
Q: S-So during these few months between July
 when they come  in to L™vov and November, 

December, there™s no sc
hool [indecipherable] 
A: Oh no, there™s no school. 

Q: There™s nothing. 

A: Nothing. 

Q: Are you going outside and playing with friends 
at all, or are you basi
cally staying inside? 
A: Oh no, no. We ™re basically staying inside 
as much. I me a n, there was some  moveme nt, 
someti mes I -- my father would send me out to try 
to fetch some thing, or a 
-- there was still some  
move me nt, because you know there just -- there wa
s a lot of co-mingling s
till between the Poles, 
Ukrainians and the Jews. And of course anybody, 
any Jew who was -- who wore the traditional 
hat and beard and all that, would certainly risk 
a -- a -- a beating, if not
 a killing, you know, and 
so forth, so they stayed at home. Younger 
people [indecipherable] moved around. So there was 
still quite a bit of move me nt, you know. Streetca
rs were operating, actually the streetcars were 
even operating inside the ghetto until the -- unti
l later on, you know, because of still a lot of 
move me nt into the ghetto, from the ghetto. So -- 
so that was -- I mean, there was no school, no -- 
there was no education, there was nothing. It was ju
st a ma tter of -- of trying to -- to live from 
one day to the next.  

Q: Do you see any of your friends?   

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
31 
 
 
Q: No. 
A: We  had very little contact, everybody was 
kind of on their own. There was a boy across the 
street, was a baker™s son, I reme
mber seeing him briefly. I don™t 
know what happened, what they 
-- where they went. Everybody was trying to 
-- to do whatever they could to --  
Q: So how did you sp -- 

A: -- to pr otect themselves. 

Q: -- how did you spend your day?  What did you do?  Do you reme mber ? 

A: Nothing. 

Q: Nothing. 

A: I mean, just -- you didn™t, you ju
st -- you just did nothing at all. 
Q: Did you read? 

A: I would read some thing, you know, I would rea
d, I would try to -- to ma ybe play some , you 
know, some bi -- some -- some -- do some -- some 
game s, or whatever it was, ma nual things, but 
there was really -- r
eally nothing, nothing, we just [indecipherable] 
Q: Did you write -- 
A: -- wait -- 

Q: -- about what was happening to you? 

A: No, no I didn™t wrote at that time , no I did not. Th
ere were -- no, it was just -- just a totally -- 
total loss of a -- of a -- of reality as it were
, you know, a sense of -- you know, from da y to day. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we fully expected of course to -- we
 knew there was a ghetto opening up, so we -- we 
were kind of waiting for that, you know
, cause they announced that, and -- 
Q: Wa s your father working? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
32 
 
 
A: No. 
Q: No. So how did you eat? 

A: We ll, was whatever he could buy on the blac
k ma rket. Black ma rket was the thing, you know. 
Used to try to get some  food. We  had some  -- I 
reme mber he had some  potatoes stashed in the 

baseme nt from before, you know, and some  canned st
uff. And -- and we trie
d to do -- to eat that, 
of course. You know, food was scarce
, was -- was a -- was a big problem. 
Q: And how in heaven™s name  did they feed Helen, this new baby? 

A: Wa s very hard. She was breastfee
ding, and did the best she could. 
Q: That mus t  have been difficult. 

A: Very difficult. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Wa s very difficult. Was very, very, very difficu
lt. It was a kind of suspense of belief if you 
will -- if you -- if you -- what I mean -- I mean not 
believing that this is really happeni ng, this is 
re-real, you know?  So -- 

Q: Do you now have nightma res? 

A: No. 

Q: You still don™t have nightma res? 

A: No. 

Q: You™re sleeping okay. 

A: Sleeping okay. I was able to 
-- I do have, you know, feelings of
 a -- of reme mbering some of 
these things and -- and that
 terrible sense of loss, and the terr
ible sense of inhumanity, injustice, 
and regret about the huma n condition as a whole, you know? 

Q: Did it ma  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
33 
 
 
A: Cause I™m a huma nist at heart -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- really, and I™m an optimis
t in terms of hoping that perh
aps centuries from now maybe -- 
ma ybe the huma n -- human kind wi ll come  to its senses. Maybe. 

Q: Maybe. 

A: Maybe.  

Q: Did it destroy some thing in you when you saw all of these people -- 

A: I would not say that it 
destroyed, I was young. You know, when you™re that young, you don™t 

have that sense of danger as it were, you know. 
You have a sense, of course, of terrible 
disappointment and terrible hurt and injury. But 
I never feared for my life, per se, you know?  I 
guess when you™re very young, you -- you don™t have thos
e feelings of -- of e minent -- immi nent 
danger as it were. I mean, I had mor e fear later 
on when I tried to be some body else. But I did 

wear my armband, of c ourse, because 
I was 13 years old in August, you know.  
Q: So you -- 

A: So I did wear an armband and -- and I recall in
cidentally that because of my looks -- we were 
not allowed to walk on the sidewalk in L™vov. 
When you wore an armband you had to walk on 
the roadway and dodge whatever traffic there was,
 horse drawn or -- or 
-- or -- or cars, you 
know. Not ma ny -- ma ny civilian cars, but you know
, Ger ma n cars, or what. And I reme mber a 
lot -- some  of the Polish people looking at me
 kind of surprised beca
use they were wondering 
whether I wa s just pl aying game s or  some thing, or tryi ng to imitate a Jew. Because here was this 

-- this -- this blonde, you
 know, blue eyed kid that absolutely
 didn™t look Jewish
 at all, you know, 
wearing this armband wi th a -- with a Star 
of David, you know, and -- and I thought that was, 
you know, kind of strange, but -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
34 
 
 
Q: What was that like for you to put on that ar
m -- do you reme mber the first time  you put it on? 
A: Yeah, I -- I kind of felt ta
inted, you know, I felt like I was --
 you know, like I was -- I felt like 
anybody could spit at me , anybody could -- could kick 
me  or beat me  up, anything like that. That 
was a very bad feeling, you know. 
Q: Did it happen? 

A: No, fortunately not, no I did not have that prob
lem. I did -- I did lose my
 bicycle, that was just 
taken away from me . Of course, 
that was soon as the -- you know, 
they -- I had a bicycle which I 
was very proud of, was given to me  a -- ma ybe -- I 
think it was under the Russians that my father 
obtained a bicycle some how. And that was, you 
know, I wa -- I was ripped off, you know, that 
was taken away. I didn™t try to ride it, it wa
s just in the -- st ayed
 there in the -- in 
[indecipherable] the house. But no, I -- I -- I 
don™t reme mber being a -- being accosted 
personally, you know, although I saw a lot of bea
tings a-and -- and th
is kind of, you know, 
atrocities, especially in the ghe
tto, you know, that was really bad. 
Q: Did you see people being shot? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: You did? 

A: Oh yes. I saw people -- I mean that was 
-- that was wanton. I mean, you know, I saw -- I 
reme mber turning the corner and I -- and we sa
w this Ukraine pulling down and shooting an old 

woma n. You know, just -- just -- I don™t know wh
ether it was target practice for him or what, 
you know, but he just -- just did that, you know, 
and that -- and then I remember -- I didn™t 

actually see the actual 
hanging, but I reme mber once comi ng into
 the ghetto from the outside and 
there was this -- there were about seven or
 eight like lamp posts, you know, and there was 
hanging, you know, there was a public, you know, it 
was public hanging of -- of Jews right -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
35 
 
 
hanging from the lamp post. They left them there 
for about -- I think couple of days, just to 
frighten the people.  
Q: And wha t  did that do to you? 

A: Terrible, was just very, very scary. Very 
scary. Just horrible. Wa s hard to describe. 
Q: Did you talk about it with your father? 

A: Oh, I mentioned it, I menti
on it to him when I saw him later on and I said -- and he heard 

about it, cause it was be -- it was well-known. It
 was one of those Aktions, they called that 
[indecipherable] Aktions that th
e Germans did fr om time to time just to s -- just  to keep 
everybody in check, just to -- to frighten the popul
ace, and whatever pretext they coul d use to do 
that, you know. But at that time , even in the ghe
tto, we still -- I did not 
he -- I was not aware -- I 
was -- know there were transports. We knew ther
e were people taken on th
e train to be sent 
some where. But I-I don™t -- did not hear about 
the crematoria, about the Auschwitz, or the 
Buchenwalds, or the Treblinkas and all th
at. At that time , 
didn™t hear that.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That was still not -- people still felt that th
ey were going some where, 
possibly to some labor 
camps and all that, because there we
re labor camps surrounding the city. 
Q: We ™re going to change the tape.  
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
36 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Okay. Michael, before I ask you about going 
into the -- the ghetto in L™ vov, do you reme mber 
people selling furniture and bri
nging clothes and having to br ing fur because the Germans were 
asking for -- they were -- 
A: Well, it was mainly, mainly there was collect
ions of that, you know, for -- from -- but ma inly 
the Germans were much more interested in -- 
in -- in -- in money and jewelry and gold, you 
know. Precious me tals. Art objects, you know, a
nd stuff like that. Ba
sic clothing, I don™t 
reme mber that as being a priority for them. But 
-- but it was a s -- just ho
rrible in a sense that 
there was, you know, there was never enough, y
ou know, there was constantly -- and what I 
think what the Germans tried to do is to get as mu
ch as they could before they -- before herding 
everybody into the ghetto, you know, because that wa
s a time where they could actually grab 
things and you were not allowed to bring anyt
hing to the ghetto than what you can carry. You 
know, there was no -- no carriages of any kind, or
 -- or bicycles, anythi
ng like that. Whatever 
you could car -- drag on your ba -- you know, hold on 
your back or suitcases and stuff. So there 
was no [indecipherable] like -- occasionally I think th
ey ma y have been able to hi re ma ybe a -- a 
-- a -- a Pole or a Ukrainian with a -- with a ca
rt or some thing like that 
if they could a -- if you 
could pay for it, but generally you could see ma ss -- 
just procession of people just going into it 
with -- with their basic belongings. 

Q: How -- how did you find out that you we
re supposed to go
 into the ghetto? 
A: All right, de -- 
there was announcements ma de, you know
, there were pol -- you know, in -- 
in -- in Poland the basic announceme nt that was 
ma de was not ma de on the radio or anything 
that, they usually by -- by pl
acards and by -- you know, they cal
led aficias, you know, they put 
on -- on -- on kiosks, you know, on -- on walls a
nd all that. And it was just an announcement 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
37 
 
 
ma de that as of that date, which was in Nove mber, everybody must -- must -- you know, they 
were -- they were establish a district
, you know, which is down the Zulkeyewska-
Zama rstynowska district, kind of 
a poor section of town, that ev
erybody has to go into that area, 
that was the ghetto. And -- and people were aw
are of the ghetto comi ng because there were 
ghettos already established in the other part 
of Poland, which was under the Germans for two 
years, you know, they started with the ghetto. So 
that -- so it was not to
tally unexpected that you 
have to go into a ghetto. But it was ve ry trauma tic because people just  have  to leave everythi ng 

behind, you know, I mean even though they knew that 
-- they knew that they 
would, just the fact 
that they had to do it, and when you do it, wh
en you leave all of your lifetime belongings, all 
your precious things, you -- you know, we didn™t 
even have enough room for photographs, tha -- 

that -- I the -- there was no fa mily photographs of
 when I was -- I reme mb er I s -- I -- I had baby 
photographs, you know, like you know, 
with my bare bottom on a -- 
on a -- on a bare rug, and all 
these photographs taken as baby -- a ba -- and 
childhood pictures, nothing, I mean, because there 
-- because this was -- this was just a burde
n, you know, you had to -- clothing and -- and -- and 
whatever you could take with you, you know, you took, 
but you didn™t take al
bums or -- or -- or -
- or -- or books, or anything like that, you know, 
that was just a -- something that you couldn™t -- 
couldn™t handle even. So that was totally lost
, you know, all the fa mily photographs, any kind of 
personal be longings, me me ntos, wha t ever, what you will. 

Q: So who ma de -- how much time did you have
 once you saw the notice?  Did you have weeks, 
or -- 

A: They have about -- they ta -- they said orig
inally I believe it was lik
e 30 days or 40 days, 45 
days, and I guess it was extended because they ju
st couldn™t handle all of it. But by -- I would 
say by -- pr obably by mi d-December, most of the 
-- most of the Jews were -- there were still 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
38 
 
 
some  Jews l e ft outside by papers, who had connec
tions as it were, with 
the Judenrat or were 
specially singled out by the Germans as desirable 
to -- you know, to -- for want some  work to be 
done, or -- or special work to be done and so fo
rth. They were very selective about who they 
considered de sirabl e and who not. So -- so by, 
I would say, by the -- by th
e end of December or 
so, you know, close to that, most of 
the -- of the Jews were in the 
ghetto, but that was still left 
open, it was still open back and forth and -- and Je
ws with work permits could leave the ghetto, 
they wer -- worked outside the ghetto, they -- th
ere were all kinds of laborer camps established, 

you know, within the city, to work for the Germ
an, you know, ni -- whatever it was, clothing 
ma nufacturer, all kinds of ma
nufacturing. Cause the Germans 
took advantage of every -- of 
every able body since all of their -- their me n 
were in the army, you know, so they used Poles 
and Jews and Ukrainians, and -- for whatever la
bors -- requireme nts they had, or they felt was -- 
was necessary for the war effort, you know. 

Q: Do you reme mber the day you left your house and went into the ghetto? 
A: I don™t reme mber the exact day. I reme mber ma
king two trips. I reme mber one trip with -- 
with -- I me ntioned to y
ou, with my brother™s grandmother, and then I came  back and then I -- I 
ma y have gone ma ybe once or twice, you know, 
because you were able -- you were allowed to 
go in and out, you know, so you could ma ke seve
ral trips before your domicile was empty and 
looted, or whatever, so you were able to -- to do th
at. So I -- it ma y have been more than one trip, 
ma ybe several trips, bringing in as much as 
a -- you know, could by -- but by that time you see, 
there was no help, my brother was already inthe camp, my -- my oldest was in the army, the 
Russian army. So there was just my father, Mo
se -- Genya, and -- and Helen, and then there was 
also a cousin. My brother™s sister™s son, Chana 
Koch was her name , from Toma szow. And so she 
was -- she wa s with us too, and so she kind of 
-- and she also spoke Ukrainian, and she kind of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
39 
 
 
looked like a peasant, you know, with a kerchief
. You did everything to hide your -- you know, 
your identity, as it were. And you took a chance by 
taking your armband off, and -- which I did 
several time s, just to be able to move around, 
you know, to be more -- more -- more free. And 
then eventually just ended up in the ghetto finally, you know. 

Q: So how -- how were the decisions ma
de as to what to take?  Or was -- 
A: Whatever you are allowed to take. 

Q: What -- 

A: You were just allowed to take what you c
ould carry with you. And -- and if you could get 
some  help, if you could get some body to -- to -- to 
-- to -- to a cart, or he -- not your so -- not 
your own, but if you can hire some body, and pay with
 whatever, with your watch or with your 

money, or with ev -- then they
 would do that, you know, but -- 

Q: And you can bring more in. 

A: Can bring more in. 
Q: But now how -- how was it decided where you were going to stay? 
A: Oh, that was basically you tried to -- my -- m-my
 father tried to find a 
place. You tried to -- to 
get into the ghetto and locate a pl ace, and we f
ound a place which is like a -- an ol d house where 
we used a downstairs and another family used 
upstairs. These were homes that were vacated, 
obviously by -- by the residents who -- who, you know
, ventured out for much better quarters, 
and it was a good deal, you know, a good swap for them. 
So there were a lot of them were just -- 
just left, even with some  of the -- some  of th
e old furniture, or old co
ts, or old, you know, straw 
ma ts, you know, ma ttresses and stuff like that. So
 we find that -- you know, you find that place 
that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
40 
 
 
Q: This is going to sound naïve, but I™m -- I -- I --  I -- how does one just sort of say, well this is 
mi ne?  Do you put a sign on the door? 

A: Well, a -- 

Q: [indecipherable] have it -- 

A: -- s-some  of them were assigned. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And some of them, you know, some  were just 
open and you just -- you ju
st -- you just went -- 
got in there and -- 

Q: And stayed. 

A: -- and took it, yeah, yeah. 

Q: And the -- did the Judenrat have anything to
 do with the assignments of these places?   
A: Some  of it did, I think 
they probably -- they -- they -- they tr
ied to assign a lot of the people, 
able bodied workers, you know, into
 si -- into quarters
 that they felt were easier to access in 
terms of getting in -- you know, to f -- to work and so forth. So there were some  -- some  of it was 

by the Judenrat and some  of it was a -- just 
on your own. You just tried to find whatever you 
could on your own. Because, you see, there was stil
l a lot of move me nt availabl e, you know, if 
you -- as long as you wore an armba nd at that time, you still could move . You could move into 

the ci -- out and in -- ou
t of the city and so forth. Now, you had to have papers where you could 
have been stopped at any mo me nt. If you didn™t ha
ve papers you were -- you™d have been taken 

away or shot or beaten up, or whatever. You had 
to have work papers. And the first thing that my 
father did, being entrepreneurial as he was, he got some  work papers. He 
never -- he didn™t work, 
but he got the pap -- papers, he paid for them. 
So he had always a work paper, you know. Ar -- 
Arbeitschein, you know. But he didn™t work, no, 
no, he was able to get away with it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
41 
 
 
Q: Now, you said there were a number of tim
es when you -- you™d leave the ghetto area, and 
take off your -- your badge. 
A: Well, s-sometimes when I -- when I wanted to
 carry something, or -- or -- or get something, 
you know, like buy some  -- some  food or some thing, to 
be sure that I wasn™t -- you know, that it 

wasn™t taken away fr om me, I would take the ar
mband off surreptitiously, and then once I was in 
the ghetto, I would put it on again, you know. But I 
had to be very careful about that, you know. 
I mean, if I had been spotted by some body doi ng that, 
I would have been in real trouble. But you 
know, again, when you™re young, you -- you -- you -- 
you™re fearless in a 
way, you know. And to 
me it was -- was daring and I -- I -- I mean, I feel lik
e every time I would take it off, I feel like I -
- like I vanquished some  -- you know, like I wa
s getting even, as it were, you know?  And I was 
proud of my self that I -- that 
I was able to do that, even thoug
h I was -- I was scared, obviously. 
So -- and -- so these are carn -- now -- now ther
e is -- now I™m comi ng to a very, very trauma tic 
experience, which is our very fi
rst close call in the 
ghetto, if I ma y. One day, the door burst open, 
a Ukrainian came in with his gun and said, ﬁCome 
with me .ﬂ My father was away, he was doing 
some thing some where, was just Genya and Helen 
and I. Didn™t allow to take anything with us, 
and was walking us to a transport. There was 
a railroad station Zama rstynowska, and we know 

by the direction that we are going 
to a transpor t [indecipherabl e] th
ere were -- at that time that 
was already starting to load people to wherever 
the destination they decided. He -- and he pulled 
a gun, and with the gun he was walking us towards that. That was one time when I felt it was -- 

was the end, was the beginning of the end. Genya 
was holding Helen in her arms and started to 
speak Ukrainian to the guard, and begging him to 
let us go. And she said, ﬁFor the fear of God, 
please let us go. Look at this ch
ild in my arms, look at this 
young boy.ﬂ She said, ﬁDo please let 
us go. We  don™t,ﬂ -- you know, ﬁwhy -- why don™
t you do that? ﬂ  And then he spotted a gold 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
42 
 
 
watch on Genya™s wrist, and he took the -- the wa
tch and he said, ﬁGo away.ﬂ We  wer e  about 
ma ybe 10 minutes away from the railroad station.
 Now that was one time  when I cried, really 
cried, because I saw this poor Helen and Genya, a
nd -- and I thought myself, what will my father 
do when he come s home  and we™re gone?  Cause this happened so often, you know, that a worker 

would go, you know, to a -- to a camp, to a la
bor camp -- these were
 workshops, you know, 
within the ghetto. He would come  home and -- a
nd his family would be gone. He™d never know -
- you didn™t know from one hour to the next. 
You didn™t know whether you would come  back 
from work. Because if you did some thing that 
they didn™t like, didn™t like the way you looked, or 
the way this, that was it, you know, they t
ook you away, or -- or
 you never -- you d -- you 
disappeared. So this was one time when I really
 broke down. So there™s one -- one of ma ny close 
calls. But this was one that was a -- that was our 
really first call, especially with that gun drawn, 
you know, where we™re facing, really facing -- and th
en we didn™t even -- I didn™t even know 
whether he was going to shoot us
 on the way to, which he could 
have easily done, because there 
were shootings all over, you know, I mean, it™s almost
 like -- like hearing sirens, and the fire -- 
fire engines in New York City when you live 
in Manhattan, you know, afte
r a while you just -- 
you just hear it, and -- and you don™t hear it
, you know, the gunshots and -- and -- and -- and 
screams, or whatever, you know. And -- so I 
thought -- I didn™t know whether he was going to 
even bother with us -- taki
ng us to the -- to the -- to
 the railroad station, to the yards, or whether 
he was going to shoot us right 
on the way to. So that was really
 bad, that was really bad. That 
was when I began to really, really began to feel the 
-- the -- the -- the depth of
 that -- of that -- of 
that atrocity, the depth of that -- of that human
 degradation, you know?  And 
that total feeling of 
helplessness, you know, totally -- to
tally helpless, you know. Totally at
 the me rcy of - -  of -- of a 
whi m, of -- of a want, and you know, just as -- just 
-- just is -- is incredible when you think about 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
43 
 
 
it, you know?  That you could just 
-- anybody -- anybody that could just
 do whatever they wanted 
with you. Whatever they wanted. Wi th no restraint.
 No restrictions. So 
the life in the ghetto, you 
know, was -- was very hard. Food was very, very s
carce, people were starving. My fa ther, again, 
was able to scrape up things. We  did not -- ma ybe
 had one me al a day. Frozen potato peels were 
at a premium. Frozen potato peels. The thi
ngs that were discarded, you know, by the -- by the 
restaurants, or by the place, whatever, you know, 
by others. But we ma naged. We  didn™t starve to 
death. I™d -- I was, you know, hungry at time s, but -- 
but I didn™t -- didn™t 
really starve, per se, 
where I -- where I couldn™t sleep because I was 
too hungry to sleep. And --
 and then there was a 
time, too, when my father establish a contact 
with a gentlema n from Wa rs aw by the name of 
Zaremba -- Zaremba, who would come into the ghe
tto, and he would trade with -- in gold and in 
-- and in gold coins and all that, 
because the people trying to -- 
to buy -- be able to buy food on 
the black ma rket, would sell whatever they coul
d salvage of their pers
onal jewelry, valuables, 
gold coins and sell it to [indecipherab
le]. So he would come  into this
 -- to -- to -- into the ghetto, 
was still wide open, and my father would do bus
iness with him, you know, by trading, and then 
in some  ways helping those peopl
e to -- to get money to be ab
le to buy things, and also, of 
course, trying to ma ke some  money for himself. 
So this Mr. Zaremba, that was the contact that 
I™m using -- me ntion [indecipherable] advisory, 
because that has a tremendous impact on my 

future survival, as it were. 

Q: Before we go into the details of that, what 
is -- Eugenya -- is Euge
n -- Eugenia or Genya -- 
A: Oh Genya, [indecipherable
] be called as Genya, yeah. 
Q: Wa s her voice -- when she talked to 
this Ukrainian guard, as calm as yours? 
A: It was a pleading voice. I didn™t 
say anything. I would -- I didn™t know -- 
Q: So [indecipherable] yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
44 
 
 
A: -- she was -- it -- it was a -- it was a really
 pleading, begging for me rcy. Just ya -- and saying 
to him, yeah I reme mber her say, ﬁBoitishe Bokha,ﬂ
 have fear of God, and I was appealing to hi s 
-- whatever religious, you know 
-- and they were religious, ir
onically, very religious, the 
Ukrainians. That was the Ukrainian or -- Cathol
ic Orthodox church, Catholic church -- Orthodox 
-- some what Orthodox -- Eastern Orthodox. And sa
ying, ﬁPlease, please, let us go. Wh y do you -
- why do you n-need us? Please let us go.ﬂ Says -- says, ﬁLook at -- look at this baby here, and 

this little boy here.ﬂ And -- and he did. 

Q: Amazing. 

A: He just did. He just took -- 

Q: One would wonder, if he hadn™t seen th
e gold watch, would he
 have -- who knows ?  
A: He could have taken the gold watch and -- 
and -- and -- and shoot us, but you know, ma ybe 
he was ambi valent, or maybe he was -- ma ybe he 
was taken by the fact that she spoke Ukrainian, 
instead of begging in Yiddish, as some  
mi ght, you know, who did not speak Ukrainian 
[indecipherable] probably spoke Ukrainian. There were
 ma ny Jews in -- in -- in -- in -- in L™vov, 
ma ny who didn™t speak even a g -- decent Polish. 

Q: Right. 

A: Who betrayed themselves as Jews even
 though they ma y have worn, you know, worn 
clothing, and -- and shaved and everything, justopening their mouth, just saying a few words, 

you knew right away they were Jewish, which is 
hard, some  f -- some  people understand that, but 
that what language does. 

Q: Did you run back to the ghetto once -- once he said go back, did you -- 

A: No, no, it was ru -- go back home, he meant, you know -- 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
45 
 
 
A: -- we -- we™re st
ill in the ghetto. 
Q: Oh you™re still in the ghetto? 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Oh, you hadn™t -- 

A: Oh, no, no, no, no, that was right 
in the ghetto. No, we we ren™t -- 
we weren™t outside it. See, 
the ghetto was still open at the time. So ther
e was on border, per se, there was no enclosure. 
Q: And the railroad tracks were very close? 

A: We ll, they weren™t very far, I think we wa
lked may have -- maybe for about 15 mi nutes. 
Another 10 mi nutes we would ha
ve been at the railroad -- 
Q: Now did you know the trains were going to Belzec? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you know by this time? 

A: W- We  knew the trains 
were going. We  -- I didn™t know
 where they were going. 
Q: You didn™t? 

A: No. We  didn™t know, I di --
 I did not know, maybe my par -- maybe -- maybe my father 
knew. I did not personally know, although I heard later on. Of course they were de -- they had 

ma ny choices, I mean, it was just Belzec, it c
ould have been anywhere. Could have been 
Majdanek, Tr eblinka, depending on the -- on the worklo
ad and -- and -- and the capacity of the -- 
of the trains and the -- and the 
-- and the -- the cars available a
nd the distances involved and so 
forth. So -- but I know there were actually any -- 
they were herding people
 into -- in
to -- into 
those railroad cars.  

Q: And I -- did you cry when you got home?  

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
46 
 
 
Q: And did they -- 
A: I™m cry -- I was crying on the way home . 

Q: On the way home. 

A: And she was hysterical. 

Q: She was hysterical? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: And did she comfort you at all, or ju
st you were both sort of e motional -- 
A: No, I -- I was just crying, I mean, you know, 
we are both, you know, there was nothing to be 
said, you know, it was just -- it was 
just another day and then -- then when my father came  home , 
he found out all about that too, and he was obviou
sly very upset about it 
and distraught, and -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and yeah, he wasn™t -- I don™t know what w
ould have happened if he had been home . I do -- 
I really don™t know. I don™t know wh
ether that -- whether -- whethe
r he would have let -- let all 
of us go, because reme mber what -- when -- w-what
 was a -- when -- an adult ma le was always a 
target, you know, whether he would have felt that 
he co -- y-you know, he would have scared to 
let -- let my fa -- I don™t -- I don™t
 know what he would have done. It™s so hard to speculate, you 
know -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- about some thing like that. So
 that was what my very, very 
first encounter with -- with -- 
with this kind of doom, a s  it were, you know, f
eeling that things were really -- you know, was -- 
was the end of it, yeah.  

Q: Was there a kind of social 
hierarchy in the ghetto so pe
ople -- you know, were wealthier 
people, people [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
47 
 
 
A: Definitely. 
Q: -- and -- and other difference -- 

A: There were -- well, there was 
the Judenrat, you know, and the -- 
and the Judenrat had a lot of 
people working with them. And I guess, by virtue
 of their -- their work, which -- and I™m not 
trying to be critical now, I™m just
 trying to say that -- 
that -- that they try 
-- they thought they 
were helping, you know, and then since they were
n™t, they obviously had a more privileged 
status that  the Germans didn™t bother them. I mean
 they let them live, as it were, and they let 
them ma ybe  give them some  rations of food or
 whatever, you know, a helper. And there were 
also, of course, people that were well off. They had 
the monies to -- to obtain things in the black 

market. They had monie s to maybe buy a -- a -- 
a labor permit like my fa
ther had, you know. On 
the other hand there were ma ny, ma ny very poor one
s, you know. I mean, the higher -- the -- the 
social structure of the Jews invol
ved was typical of -- of
 -- of -- of social structures and ma ybe 
even like nowadays here at home in the States, th
ere were -- they were not just merchants, they 
were cobblers, they were tailors, they were -- 
and in street where I liv
e, you know, there was a 
baker across the street. There was a -- a -- a -- 
a -- a -- you know, a shoemaker. There was even -- 
even one that -- that had a horse and buggy, you 
know, that -- they ca
ll them fiacres, you know, 
they were -- they were like ta
xis, you know, horse -- horse draw
n taxis, you know, the old type 
you know with the -- that you see in Stanley Pa
rk, you know, in New York. And so there were 
all st ratas. In fact, we even have a co
uple Jewish prostitutes that we knew of. 
Q: In the ghetto? 

A: In -- no, no, no, in L™vov.  

Q: In L™vov. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
48 
 
 
A: In L™vov. Now I-I™m using this advisorly becaus
e -- because to -- to res -- to respond to your 
question about the st rata of the so
cial structure, there was -- th
ere were all kinds of different 
structures, unlike the small shtetls where you 
had only ma ybe a few me rchants and ma ybe a 
cobbler or some thing. In the big 
cities they -- you had all clas
ses of society, represented by the 
Jews, which is not ba -- ma ybe that well known. So -- so as a result, thes
e people who went into 
the ghetto were obviously the same  -- same  groups, 
of social groups. And th
e ones that -- that -- 
that were poor obviously the ones -- the first ones 
to -- to -- too poor to di
e of -- of -- of -- of 
starvation, of san -- poor sanitation, 
of lack of clothing. You know, winters can be very se -- very 
severe in Poland, you know, it™s got a severe, yo
u know, si -- a kind of a -- you know, northern 
Canadian, if you will, climate, you know, like a climate of like a Wi nnipeg. Very, very below 

zero temperatures. In fact, I reme mb er I got once fr
ostbite, that was before the war, on my toes, 
just going to school and going back, because I -- 
because the school was closed and I insisted on 
going to school because I felt a sense of duty, 
I must go to school, I must go to school. My 
parents insisted I don™t go, well sure enough I we
nt and by the time I came back, I had frostbite 
on two of my toes, you know, and I was sick
 for several days, you know, and long healing 
process. So -- so that what ha
ppened, you know, the -- the ones that were -- and of course ma ny 
[indecipherable] of the young me n, ma ybe some  of
 the poor [indecipherable] Jewish police of 
the ghetto, they felt that they could -- this is one
 -- there was one way of -- of also prolonging the 
survivals -- prolonging the -- the --
 the -- the way of life, or tryi
ng to, you know, trying to -- to -- 
to ma nage not to be sent away. So they were 
[indecipherable] they were policemen that they -- 
they used -- that they used by the Germans as
 Jewish police to keep order or carry out, you 
know, some  of the orders that the Germans use
d, especiallyin rounding 
up people, you know, for 
-- for the labor camps and checking docume nts and so forth. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
49 
 
 
Q: Were they hated in th
e ghetto, the Jewish police? 
A: They were not liked in the ghetto. No, they™re de
fi nitely not liked in the ghetto at  all. In fact, I 
would say probably most of them were hated. Becau
se they were -- they were -- they saw them 
doing the kind of things that -- that they were and -- and I don™t think -- th-they were hated. They 
were basically hated, I™m sure. 
And I -- and I™m su -- I™m sure many of t hem thought they were 
doing good things, th-they -- they were helping, like 
the Judenrat, you know?  But in the end of it, 
they didn™t, obviously. They didn™t he
lp, no, nothing helps. Nothing helped. 
Q: And did people -- were they angr
y at the Judenrat as well, that th
ey didn™t like what they were 
doing, there was [indecipherable] 

A: I don™t think that was generally
 -- I think that the feeling wa
s that the Judenrat was -- was 
trying to help, but I don™t think th
at they were -- they were th
inking that they were doing any 
good, per se. From what I know my -- my father di
dn™t have a very high opi
nion of the Judenrat. 
He felt that they were just -- just being a 
mouthpiece for the Germans, or  you know, trying to 
keep things together. And so historically one 
could argue that perhaps they did help, you know, 
in some ways to prolong the -- 
the -- the agony as it were, you know. 
Q: And did you notice pe ople being selfish, corrupt
, stealing from each other. I mean, what did 
you notice about the -- 

A: We ll, that -- I™ve been thinking about that al
l, and you know, I came to the conclusion that -- 
that a lot -- some of the m just 
-- just trying to survive did some  very unspeakable things. Can you 
blame the m for it?  I really don™t 
know. I don™t know what I could 
really say that they did it on 
purpose. They did it because they -- they felt th
at that --as that was one way of surviving. And 
one of the things that I reme mb
er my father commenting about 
some of the Jewish police -- I 
didn™t see it myself, but commen
ting, that actually they would, in rounding up old people, those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
50 
 
 
are the priorities, getting the old 
and the sick and get ri -- getti
ng rid of them. That he actually 
saw it himself, that they were actually taking th
eir parent s and ma rching them off because they 
were told to round up old people a
nd so forth. And that was -- I™m sure that was not done a lot. 
Was an aberration, but it only was a -- it was an
 example of -- of what can be done, how -- you 
know, to -- to the psyche of a huma n under -- 
under these terribleconditions, you know. How it 
destroys any sense of -- of proprie
ty, any sense of -- of reason and then -- and fa mily feelings and 
you know, like that. Self preser
vation, mi sguided, sick. 
Q: Okay, we™re going to change the tape now. 
A: Okay. 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
51 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Okay. Michael, when we ended in the last 
tape, we were -- I was 
asking you about a kind of 
hierarchy in the -- in the ghett
o, and I wanted to know whether -- you spoke about your father 
telling a story about police -- Jewi
sh police taking their parents. 
I want to know if you ever saw 
anything, people mi streating each other. Di -- 
not that you heard of it, but you were watching 
what people were doing and 
how they were behaving. 
A: I have not really seen myself
, actual, any kind of physical viol
ence against one another. What 
I saw is people with anguish on their faces
, obviously people were hungry. People also not 
knowing who was who, you know, having -- look -- ha
ving -- looking with fear, looking with 
distrust, with apprehension. You know, when this 
happens day after day after day after day, it 
wears and it become s a -- almost a way of 
life, you know, you -- you -- you feel hunted and 
haunted and so I saw that, you know. I -- I mean ther
e was -- certainly ther
e wasn™t ever any kind 
of humor, or any kind of -- of -- 
of -- of what shall I say, feeling 
of relax -- of relaxation in any 
way, everything was tense. The air was tense, a
nd -- and because the ghetto was open, you see, it 
was open to everybody to go in and 
out, in fact the streetcar was 
going all the way to the end of 
the line, which I used later on when I left 
the ghetto, and -- so anybody could come  in, you know, 
and they -- and you looked and you didn™t know
 who was who. Obviously people who -- the 
Jews wore -- wore armbands, but when you ra 
-- walked the street a
nd you ran into some body 
without one, who was that person? Was a Ukrainia
n, was it a Pole, was it a friend, wa s it a foe?  
Was it a secret police, you know, because they use 
a lot of secret police without -- no uniforms. 
What would happen next, you know? You -- yo-you 
-- you walk to -- you know, you try to -- to 
avoid that -- that person. So it was just a -- a ki
nd of a -- a feeling of si
ege, a feeling of a -- a 
siege me ntality, okay?  With hunger, with -- with 
-- you know, and -- and -- a
nd one of the things 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
52 
 
 
that I -- I saw is a lot 
of the -- of the hearses,
 you know, that that -- you 
saw a lot of that horse 
drawn -- cause they were collecti
ng bodies. And that, of course, th
at did it to Jews who worked 
on the -- so you saw that, and that be -- that
 was a common scene. You know, you turn the 
corner, you walk the street and there was an-a
nother one hearse, and -- and a -- ma ybe another 
one some where else. So you saw that, you know, and 
-- but -- but as far as overt mi streating per 
se, I did not see that. 
Q: I mean even psychologically, not necessarily 
physically. You say people 
didn™t -- there was 
no humor. Do -- do you reme mber your mood?  

A: Well, my  mood was basically 
one of -- of -- of anger, some
 fear. Some time s feeling of 
hunger, and basically also a feeling of loneliness, you know, I was -- I was -- I didn™t have any 

friends, I didn™t have anybody to -- to
 associate with, and I lost all 
my -- the contact with all my -
- my playma tes, my -- my classmates, you know. So I was totally alone, you know, and when 

you™re 13 years old, you need compa nionship, yo
u need -- you need to -- to you know, you -- 
you want to -- to -- to pl ay, you want to associ
ate with some body because you™re not a grown-up, 
you know, you don™t have much in common with the 
adults, you know. So th
ere was this feeling 
of isolation and loneliness, you 
know, this [indecipherable] living from one day to the next, not 
knowing what™s going to happen next.  

Q: But there were other kids in the ghetto? 

A: There were other kids in the ghetto, but
 -- but -- but there wa
s not muc h -- much 
[indecipherable]. Everybody was just -- was just asurvival feeling, you know
. I mean, that -- that 
-- you didn™t play in the streets, no way. You w
ouldn™t dare to do that, 
you wouldn™t want to do 
that. I think if you played and had fun proba
bly some body would descend on you -- even on the 

kids, you know, and then and so there was -- ther
e was not -- none of that. I mean, I would walk, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
53 
 
 
you know, I would ma ybe take a walk and -- and 
go there and look around and -- and so forth, 
but I -- I had no -- there was no way of -- of 
having, at least in my area where I was, no 
playma tes, nobody to really exchange any t
houghts or ideas or whatever, you know. And you 
didn™t even dare to talk 
about it, you know, you didn™t know whom you were talking to. 
Q: Did you see a change in your father and in Ge
nya, did their personalities become  harsher in 
their way of behaving differen
t than you had seen before? 
A: Well, they -- I think -- I think my father neve
r showed much of that 
himself, he was always 
sort of tough and survival type of, you know
, person. Genya, I would say was probably more -- 
more affected, more distraught. Sh
e was -- I think she was -- she t
ook it very hard when -- when 
Helen was given away, losing her child. But th
at was the only way, that was, you know, my 
father had this -- this -- always 
a sense of trying to see what can be -- can be done to survive, you 
know, that was one of his -- was alwa ys this -- this -- he had that ve
ry strong survival instinct and 
-- 
Q: So it was his idea  to do that? 
A: Oh, I™m s ure, oh definitely, I -- we had to 
pay for it too, you know, this was not done for free. 
So -- so that was that feeling, too. So she wa
s -- she was very -- very badly -- t-took -- it was 
very bad for her to do that. And also, my father
 was out, you know, since he had a work permit, 
he could mi ngle, he could go out there and he 
could scrounge and do whatever he could, while 
she was alwa ys at home, you know, I mean, she was 
-- she didn™t -- she didn™t work. So therefore 
she -- she was basically just as much alone as 
I was, you know?  My brother was already in camp, 
you know, so -- so there was just like the days --
 from one day to the next, you know, I mean just 
-- you lose a sense of time, you lose a sense of
 -- of balance and -- a
nd then you -- you -- down 
the street you see some  people that lived ther
e and all of a sudden th
ey™re -- they™re gone, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
54 
 
 
know. So -- so it was basically as I said before, it 
was just a total feeling 
of -- of a -- of a siege 
me ntality, of a -- you know, being totally -- be
ing sort of a -- a hope
lessness, you know, if you 
will. 
Q: Where did the food come from when you went to
 Wi nniki, to -- to brin
g food to your brother? 
A: Okay, now Genya would prep
are some  food, you know, she woul
d make it and she would put 
in a -- in a cardboard container.
 And then I would go out of th
e ghetto, the ghetto was still open 
at the time, and -- actually even
 with the armband, and I would 
go all the way out. I would walk. 
It was ma ybe 10 miles or so, but for a young kid 10 
miles isn™t that far. Or  more, maybe more, 
I™m not exactly the dist ance. 

Q: One way? 

A: But most of the time -- one way -- but most of the time it was not Wi nniki, it was -- it was 

actually -- in Wi nniki I think it 
was ma ybe once or twice, but ma ybe
 half a dozen time s I went to 
the opposite direction, actually in
 the direction of 
the Janowska lager -- 
Janowska camp, I should 
say. And there there was a quarry where my brothe
r George wa s working in a -- with a group of 
other inma tes, and as I said before, he -- 
by hand, you know, they were actually breaking up 
boulders and stones and crushing them to create th
e -- the -- the gravel fo
r the -- for the roads 
because that™s what the -- the Germans were 
alwa ys tryi ng to keep their roads, you know, going, 
you know, for the -- for the armi es, for the -- the 
troops and for the -- and so forth. So he was 
there, you know, and that was -- that was a terr
ible sight to see these me n who were not -- you 
know, not even used to this hard
 physical labor, you know, they we
re -- to be able to all day 
long, can you imagine all day long standing there 
and -- and with hamme r s breaking -- breaking 
stones with very little breaks,
 you know, ma ybe four mi nutes at
 a time . And like eight or 10 
hours a day, you know. So ma ny died, you know, my -- 
my -- my George relates the -- the -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
55 
 
 
fact that ma ny who couldn™t -- who were wea
k, you know, or cou -- or wou -- couldn™t -- you 
know, couldn™t ma ke it, you know, were just shot a
nd so I reme mber that, so that™s why we got 
the food and that was -- that helped them a lot. 
But then -- course when I -- when I left, and of 
course when they would -- they
 wouldn™t allow food later on and 
he ma de  some  contacts with 
some  local peasants where he -- they were he
lping him out a little bit too, but -- but he had a 
very, very rough time of it. He had typhoid fever 
in the camp , he was almost shot because of 
that. There was an outbreak of typhoid fever, wh
ich kind of decima ted the camp that he was in 
and they brought in new people into the camp. So 
that™s how -- that™s what happened with the -- 
with that .  
Q: Wa s it -- was it dangerous for you to walk on [indecipherable] 

A: At that time  it wasn™t that dangerous because
 the ghetto was still open, there was still a lot of 
communication. And when I brought the food, at th
at time the guards allo
wed food. They still 
allowed food at that early stage. They just 
didn™t bother, you know, with that, and I wa s a young 
kid, you know, so I just went over. And -- and you 
can imagine what the other -- when they saw 
food, what happened. Of course my brother woul
d share some of it with them, too, you know, 
because they were -- everybody was hungry there. 
They gave  them food but obviously nowhere 
near enough for the physical exertion and the fill 
of hard labor. I mean you -- just incredible 
when you -- just the sight of t
hose poor -- poor people doing that. It
 was just like a deliberate 
way of -- of, you know, of killing th
em with -- with -- 
with -- with forced labor, because how 
much could they accomplish, you know, by -- by 
breaking up stones, you know, ma nually, you 

know, I mean there™s just a -- we just -- but th
ey did, you know, and they 
-- they built the roads 
and -- and my brother eventually ended up on a --
 on a steamroller, you know, and so forth, he™s 
a -- he has his own story to tell about that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464

Q: Were you a -- were you able to
 spend a little time with your 
brother, or you came  wi th food 
and you left? 
A: Oh no, no, I just came with food, and -- and when
 he finished eating I 
would bring -- I would 
take the -- the pots, th
ey -- there was a couple stacked up back -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and I just watched him eat, which took ve
ry little time, believe me , you know, he just 
gulped it down, practically. And th
en I would just bring it back 
and I was able to do it a few 
times. I think ma ybe no more than maybe three or four times. 

Q: I see, so this wasn™t a long term -- 

A: Yeah, oh, no, no, no, it wasn™t an ongoing th
ing, no, you couldn™t -- I couldn™t do that. 
Q: This mus t  have been hard on you. I don™t m
ean the walk, but seeing him in that place. 
A: Oh God, it was horrible, was just horrible to
 see him because you know, was horrible. And to 
see all these other young -- young me n, they -- they se
 -- they selected those, you know, for -- for 
the labor and -- and was just a -- t -- horribl e si ght.
 I feel sorry for -- I p -- feel badly for my -- I 
mean from one trip to the ne
xt, I didn™t even know whether he would survive, you know, 
whether I would see him again. 

Q: Right. 

A: Cause you didn™t know. And then the -- and 
then they had occasions when they were 
ma rching back to the camp from the  day™s wo
rk, some ti me s they would get stopped, and at 
random they would pick out some  of these and -- 
and shoot them. In fact, they had a -- they -- 
they -- one of those camp com -- commandants had 
a rule that for every inmate that tried to 
escape, even if he was caught, they
 would sic -- shoot six -- six of
 -- of the -- of the -- of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
57 
 
 
inmates in the camp, and that™s -- so
 -- so that happened too, and he almost got shot, so -- so he -- 
he had a really tough time of it, 
but he ma naged just to survive. 
Q: So how did it happen that you were going to 
leave L™vov ghetto?  Is 
there some thing that 
[indecipherable] 
A: Okay, okay, now my father 
obviously realized, you know, that some thing -- that how -- how 
we -- how are we going to survive, you know. He didn™t know what -- what -- you know, he tried 

to work out some thing. Escaping from the ghetto was imposs i ble. Even when there was open, 

you know, there was no way. He couldn™t do it hi
mself because he would be imme diately 
recognized as being a Jew. Genya wouldn™t leave 
my father. And so he came upon this idea, and 
one morning he said -- he prepared, you know, gett
ing prepared a little backpack, and he sa -- 
and he gave me  a birth certifi
cate in Latin, with the name  of
 Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn. And he 
said, ﬁYou take this, you go to the railroad st
ation, you buy a ticket for Wa rsaw, and you™re 
going to go to Mr. Zaremba™s apartment.ﬂ So he
 did arrange with Mr. Zaremba, the business 
associate of his to -- for me  to 
at least get to him. Whether he 
was -- I was going to stay with him 
or not I didn™t know that, but that wa
s the address he gave me  in Wa rsaw. 
Q: So there™s no prepara
tion [indecipherable] nothing. 
A: There was absolutely no preparation, no, my father
 wasn™t like that, he sa
id, hey, this is it. He 
didn™t ask me am I afraid to go, or 
-- or what to do. He said, this 
is what you have to do, this is 
what you do. And he obtained this bi
rth certificate, I guess, on the 
black ma rket, whatever it was. 
It looked very, very authentic, as it will be evid
ent later on fr om my -- fr om my talk here. And -- 

and that™s what I did. I reme mber taking that litt
le backpack. He gave me  enou -- gave me  money 
for the railroad ticket. Then he told me that in
 my jacket there was a sewn in gold coin, the 
purpose of which I didn™t know exactly what he wa
nted for, but I realized later on what it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
58 
 
 
for. And I reme mber taking the backpack, and we
 were on a -- a -- our gh
etto was on a street 
called Sienna, S-i-e-n-n-a, Sienna 
Street. And just about two blocks
 away was the last stop of the 
streetcar, and that was like in
 the spring of ™42, I don™t know exact
ly the date, but it wa s before 
the ghetto was closed, you know. I believe the ghe
tto was closed in August, I believe, of ™42, 
right? That was before then. It was a nice day, 
warm day. And I reme mbe r  before I turned the 
corner, I took off my armband and threw it away, ju
mped on the streetcar a
nd went straight to the 
railroad station. Bought a ticket for Warsaw. 
Nobody questioned, there was a lot of move me nt 
there, I mean, you know. After all, you™re not a li
 -- little baby when you™re 13 year old, you™re a 
young boy. And I got on the train and went towards Wa rsaw. And this is when I had my second 
close call, very, very close call. As we were 
riding on the train, all of a sudden the train was 
stopped. It was some where near Lu
blin, which is a city in the Lublin province, okay? Everybody 
out. The whole train was emptied out. And here 
were the Germans, SS with some  civilians, 
setting up a table. Everybody out?  Everybody in
 line?  And everybody show documents. And 
then they would say left and right. Right we
re older people, wome n with documents, Poles, 
Ukrainians, you name  it, whatever. Maybe even 
some  civilian Germans who were let go right 
away. On the left they [indecipherable] so
me  young me n -- ma ny young me n. And then I heard 
the mur mur, the talk among those 
that this another one of th
ose round-ups for Polish workers 
that the Germans periodically would grab to send
 them to their factor
ies, wherever it was, 
whether it™s in Poland or Germany or  any place, 
to work in their factor ies because they were 
short of ma npower, because everybody was in
 the -- on the -- you know, in the army, the 
German ar my. So I had no choice, I had to go in. 
So I showed my -- my 
bi rth certificate, he 
looked at me , left. I guess they felt that I wa
s old enough to ma ybe be a worker, too. I was in 
good shape. So, what™s next then? Okay, I asked 
around, they said well -- one of the guys said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
59 
 
 
what they do is they take you into a staging 
area overnight and in the morning you go to a public 
bath because they want to -- to delouse you, as
 they called it, you know, before you go anywhere 
else, you know, and so forth. And then you -- an
d then they ship you out. And these guys, you 
know, they didn™t care, they were Poles you know, 
so they were -- some  of them had -- had 
vodka with them and this and that, you know, and 
there were -- there we
re [indecipherable] say 
well, that™s what we have to do, we have to ta 
-- these are the ones that ob
viously didn™t have any 
papers, working papers. So I spend a kind of a sl
eepless night because I knew that if I went to a 
public bath my anatomy would imme
diately betray me  and that woul
d be the end of it, the end of 

it. Whether they would have informe d on me , or
 whether they would just kick me  out you know, 

and -- but the guards were there, you know, they were -- they obviously didn™t want anybody to 

run away. So in the morning, as we were -- and 
I left my backpack behind, of course, because 

you would -- after the bath you woul
d go back to the camp again, right
, and then from there they 
would transport you and load you on a train and wh erever they -- you know, they ship. So as we 
were walking towards the bathhouse, and I thought okay, here is th
e end of that, right?  At the 
bathhouse, one of the guys, he said, ﬁRun away,run away.ﬂ Because they kind of -- there was 
another guard, there was one of the people there,
 because I was the ki d, I was the youngest, there 
was nobody in my age in that group. In fact, I gue
ss they probably thought what is he doing 
here?  You know, I mean, this young 
kid doesn™t belong. And one of 
the Ukrainian guards kind of 
-- was turned his back -- and this was a busy area
, and the guy says, ﬁGo, run away.ﬂ And I just 
ran. And I ran right across the street , left  my 
-- my  -- my backpack, still had my ticket wa -- on 
me , fortunately I didn™t leave it in my backp
ack. And went on the next train, continued to 
Warsaw. You know, when you think a
bout it -- when I think about 
it, it just seems unreal. Just 
unreal. And then on the train -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
60 
 
 
Q: Wa it, one second. How come  you weren™t sc
ared to just run?  What -- what did -- 
A: Because I had no choi ce. 
Q: There™s one -- uh-huh. 

A: I had no -- I had no choice. In fact, when I 
ran I thought I wa s going to hear a shot behind me . 
I -- I just ran. I mean what -- th
ere was nothing that I could do. I 
thought myself, this is it. I had 
to do that. You know, cause I was still -- I di
dn™t do it on my own, I was kind of encouraged, I 
say hey, run, go, go, go, go. It was -- I mean, I had 
no choice because -- because I™m sure that if I 
-- if -- if they had discovered, 
there were enough of them whoe
ver it was that would -- would 
have informed on me . Some  ma y -- would have
 not, ma ybe some  would have just, you know, 
said tha -- but some body sure would have, cause ther
e were just too ma ny of them not to have at 
least one or two that would have
 said, hey this -- this Jewish
 kid, you know, he -- he da -- has no 
right to live, you know, I mean, kill hi m. I had no choice. When you have no choice you just do 

it.  
Q: And wha t  was in your backpack that you left? 
A: Just some belong -- some  underwear, you 
know, a sweater, [indecipherable] nothing -- 

nothing of any -- 

Q: So you have the jacket with the -- 

A: Jacket -- 

Q: -- the gold coin. 

A: -- gold coin sewn into the lining of the jacket. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the ticket in my pocket. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
61 
 
 
A: And my - -  and my birth certificate -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- you know, on me . And I™m -- 

Q: So you [indecipherable] on the train again. 

A: -- on a train to Wa rsaw. And then I™m in -- on the 
train to Warsaw, and I s
it in this -- in this -- 
in this cabin, you know, there wa
s like -- on the train. 
And that was pretty crowded. And then 
there was this woma n looking at me  sort of aska
nce. She didn™t know what to ma ke of me , you 
know, she thought, you know. So she asked me , cross yourself. Now, this not a simple thing. 

Most Jewish kids wouldn™t know how to do it, ev
en, or if they did it th
ey wouldn™t do it right. I 
happened to have known how to do that. Because 
in Poland what you have to do is you have go 
this, this, this, this and this
. You have to close your hands. 
Just going this way is not enough. 
This is how you do it, you go this way and that. A
nd left and right, not right and left, to cross 
yourself. So I did that. And I guess she thought, we
ll if this kid were Jewish, he wouldn™t be 
doing that, you know. They have 
these -- these ideas, 
you know, that a Jew on penalty of death 
ma ybe wouldn™t cross himself, you know, because
 I [indecipherable] you know. But any rate, I 
did that, and that was it, so she just let go. So 
that was, you know, another one of those incidents. 
So I arrive in Wa rsaw on a beautiful, warm 
day. Big Wa rsaw railroad
 station. Big sign in 
German, wheels must turn for victory. 

Q: Really? 

A: Oh yeah, that was a very common sloga
n. ﬁRäder müssen rollen für den Sieg,ﬂ you know. 
And then another big sign saying, ﬁDeutschlands
 Sieg an allen Fronte
n.ﬂ Deutsch -- German 
victory on all fronts. Okay?  So I go out there, bus
y, busy Wa rsaw. And as I 
turn the corner, I see 
placards, which I never saw before, in Polis
h. Any person hiding, harboring or abetting, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
62 
 
 
facilitating a Jew is punishable by death. That was 
the first time that I ever saw this, I never saw 
this in L™ vov. I guess they wa -- didn™t need
 the -- the -- you know, it wa
s to [indecipherable] 
there, you know. So that was -- that™s the way I -- 
that was my greeting in 
Warsaw just -- just as 
soon as I turned the corner, wit
hout any backpack and so forth. 
And I knocked on the door of the 
Zarembas and of course they took me  in. And 
they knew I was comi ng. And I stayed with the 
Zarembas for about two or three 
days. And I didn™t know what to 
expect. But there™s one thing I 
did instinctively. I gave them the gold coin. 
Because it crossed my 
mi nd that I couldn™t do 
anything with it, and it -- I -- it crossed my mi nd th
at my fathe r  probably did that on purpose, he 
didn™t tell me to do that, to give
 them -- give him the gold coin, ma
ybe in payment or -- or just -- 
just to reward him for the fact that he took it 
upon himself for me  to -- to see him, you know, to -
- because after all, it was very danger
ous you know, for anybody to -- you know, this Mr. 
Zaremba, his wife was -- was known as a Volksdeutscher. Now, do you know what that is? 

Q: Why don™t you explain it? 
A: Volksdeutscher was a categor y that the Germans establ ishe d for any Poles that had German 
ancestry, that had any kind of Ger ma n ca -- German
 -- in their blood, so to speak. So they were 
kind of folk Germans. They were given special
 privileges, status, you 
know, preferential work 
and all that. So she was a Volksdeutscher and th
ey often had German vis itors because of that. 
Sometimes army people, military. It  seems to me  -- 
and I was never told this -- that  they were a 
little bit concerned abou
t me , since people that they knew they had no children. All of a sudden, 
who is this kid?  What™s this kid doing here?  
I don™t know for sure, but Zaremba had a plan for 
me , and within about three or four days, he
 introduced me  to a new life in Warsaw. 
Q: All right, that™s a perfect en
ding for this part of the tape. 
We™ll move on to the next tape. 
End of Tape Four

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Michael, I want to go back a 
little bit. First of all, how eas
y was it for you to find the house of 
the Zarembas? 
A: Wa sn™t very hard. Th-They 
lived right near the railroad 
station, and I j -- I just asked 
some body, you know, in the street as to where it is a
nd they just pointed it 
out to me  and so forth. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because I didn™t have any lugga
ge with me , and so I was like a kid, ma ybe they thought I was 
on an errand, or I was -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- picking some thing up, whatever, you know. So 
I went to the Zaremba, fortunately they 
were home, you know, I knocked on the door and there they were. 

Q: And were they warm people, were they -- 

A: They were friend -- oh yes, they were very
 nice, very warm people. Of course, Zaremba knew 
my father, she -- she met me -- his 
wife met me for the first time -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- she was really nice. They
 had no children, and they had Ge
rman visitors in uniform and 
[indecipherable] and of course Zaremba took a
dvantage of this by, you 
know, doing all kinds of 
black ma rketeering and stuff. But I don™t f -- I didn™t 
feel that comfortable. I wa -- not so much I 
was af -- afraid, it™s just the 
proximity of them, you know, really bothered me. I -- I just didn™t 
want to -- didn™t want to be in the same  room
, you know, as it were, you know, and all this, with 
their -- you know, drinking and talk
ing and then the -- all that, you know, and so forth. And 
enjoying their victories, you know, and 
the -- and the -- etcetera. So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
64 
 
 
Q: Did they talk about what was going on with Jews? 
A: No. 

Q: Did they say anything about that? 

A: No, no. 

Q: They didn™t. 

A: No, I -- I -- I [indecipherable] I did knew Ge
rman quite well, you know, even though I was a 
kid, which be -- which will be interesting comment I™ll make later on about -- about how I had to 

curtail my German. But -- so about
 -- oh, about three days or four 
days, he took me  to this place 
which was a workshop, a little plant by the name  of
 Boleslaw Konarski, I mention the address, 
and I™ll spell it later. And introduced me  as a 
distant relative™s son, a half-orphan from the 
province of Tarnopol -- cause that
™s where my bi rth certificate,
 and he knew about the birth 
certificate -- who wants to learn a trade. Who wa
nts to learn a trade, 
you know. Now it was very 
common to have orphans or kids that didn™t go to high school to learn a trade. And the way it 
worked was that you actually lived on the pr
emises, you ate and slept on the premises, and you 
worked on the premises. And I slept on a loft with 
a couple of other kids about my age, and I was 
put to work. Now, Polish which was perfect 
was a L™vov Polish. And the L™vov Polish dialect 
was very mu ch divided by the Wa rsaw people. It
 was sort of analogous 
to let™s say a Chicago 
English versus Brooklyn English, okay?  With Wa
rsaw English being c
lipped, sort of you know, 
short and clipped, whereas as you know the Brookl
yn is the singsong and all those yishes, and all 
that. So they kind of id
entified almost the -- the 
L™vov Polish with Jews, with Jewish Poles. And 
I caught this right away, they -- where they ki
nd of started to kind of
 laugh at me , you know, 
they -- there™s some  jokes about that in Polish ab
out the -- about the L™vov dialect. And this was 
a dialect spoken not only by -- by, you know, lowe
r classes, wa s just 
a -- a typical, you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
65 
 
 
even -- even in the -- 
you know, in New York, a good New York English is not like a -- like a 
Midwestern English, even -- even the -- you know,
 a mong the intellectuals. So I had to quickly 
learn the Wa rsaw dialect. I was very conscious 
of that, I was very concerned because I knew I 
wou -- I was afraid that they ma y que stion that
, that I ma y have -- you 
know. And my biggest, 
biggest problem was again being circumcised. That
 preyed on my mi nd vi
rtually 24 hours a day, 
because when you live with young -- wa -- othe
r boys, you know, and you associate with them, 
and you -- and you -- and you there, you know, boys te
nd to play game s, you know. They™d li -- 
some ti me s they compare anatomies, you know, a
nd all that. And I was very, very concerned 
about that because the mi nute that would happe
n, you know, I -- I often thought to myself, wha t  
would they do if they were to discover -- what
 would they -- what w
ould they do. And I didn™t 
think that they would inform on me because they
 were very, ve ry pate -- you know, Poles were 

very anti-Germa n. But they would definitely ki
ck me  out, you know. I mean, they would not kick 
me , because I mean, they could be all killedfor that, you know. Or ma ybe some  of them -- 
ma ybe some  of the, you know, workers would actu
ally ma ybe even inform on me , be cause we 
lived in this place where there we
re -- at first there were three 
apprentices, and there were four 
journeymen as they called them. These are the 
foreme n, the journeymen, th-the ones that the -- 
that they knew their tr
ade and all that. And was hard to 
tell among them, who -- who would be, 
you know, who would be the one that would actual
ly -- would actually denounce me or -- to the -
- to the authorities being Jewish. So that was 
constantly on my  mi nd, and I was very concerned 
about that. And fortunately I -- 
I -- we never got into that. 
You know, I ended up with -- with 
only one. There were two more boys, and there wa
s one -- one apprentice by the name  of Janek. 
And he was kind of, you know, h-he -- he -- he was a 
little bit of a -- how sh
all I say?  Quiet and -
- and not so outgoing. So I -- we never had occasi
on to [indecipherable]. We slept in the same  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
66 
 
 
on the same  loft, and -- and we worked, you know. And the -- the pl ace of work -- what they 
ma nufactured there, or manuf
actured was rawhide harnesses for the utility workers on -- on 
poles, you know, they climbed the poles. Rawhide harnesses. Wa s very, very hard work, you 

know, to si -- you had to sew it by hand. They were
 -- they used underarm 
holsters for the secret 
police. That was one of the jobs 
too, that they had to -- to -- to
 work on. All kinds of bags, and 
wallets and this kind of stuff, okay. The owners lived on the sa -- everything was on one level, 

you know, the owners, their qua -- you know, thei
r bedroom, their workshop and everything was 

on the same  level. And not too long after I starte
d there, because of my age, 13 years old, I was 
going to be 14 in the fall, there was a law that 
you had to get a Kennkarte. A Kennkarte means in 
German -- Kenn is to know, and ka
rte was like a i -- I.D. na -- I.
D. card, okay?  And you had to 
go to the local authorities to pi
ck it up, to the police, to th
e Gestapo, you know. So what do you 
do now?  I had no choice, I had to go. I couldn™
t say I wouldn™t -- I™m not going to go. I didn™t 
know what they were doing there, whether th
ey had suspi -- you know, whether they were 
screening people for the -- for the -- for the -- and 
I went. I showed them my
 birth certificate, I 
told them I was working for the 
firm of Boleslaw Konarski. Boom, I got a Kennkarte. So here I 
was officially now an official Aryan.No phony, no, no, you know [indecipherable] I was 

officially an Aryan, no more 
Jewish, you know, right?  Except for my anatomy I was no more 
Jewish. And living in Warsaw at that time, I en
countered a number of th
ings -- that was even 

before -- before the following year, before the gh
etto. In other words, when you™re on the streets 
of Wa rsaw -- after work, you know, I and this 
kid, we were just roaming around, you know, and 
so forth. They had these -- the police was walk
ing down the street and 
they would periodically 
stop people and ask for I.D.s and round-ups. And 
what they were looking for basically is 
undocument e d Poles. They were looking also fo
r resistance because Wa rsaw already had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
67 
 
 
strong resistance move ment at that
time . And of course
 they™re looking for Jews, or people that 
were trying to escape, Jews who tried to -- to 
-- to escape from the ghetto, who were -- were out 
of the ghetto. And what they would do is -- oh, an
d incident ally, in addition to those placards 
which said harboring a Jew, you know, is -- i-it
 would be death penalt
y, they had placards 
showing how to identify a Jew. And they were showing -- presumably that was all developed by 
-- by this -- I think it was Rosenberg was the Ge
rman guy who pr -- who apparently claime d that 
there are certain anatomical featur es in the Je
wish face which are 100 percent Jewish, okay?  By 

virtue of the shape of the nose, by virtue of the 
shape of the ears. By some  bone structure, by the 
cranial structure, whatever it was, with very el
aborate charts, you know, as 
to how to identify the 
Jews. And that was done in Polish, so that Pole
s who were inclined to do so, you know, would be 
-- or Ukrainians, whoever it was -- 
and there were a lot of Estoni
ans and Latvians too at that 
time, cause they were the guards of the -- ma ny of
 them were guards of the ghetto, would be able 
to identify a Jew and ma ybe report 
him to the -- to the Germans, who would be very grateful for 
it, I™m sure, you know. So that was another thing. So
 what they would do is as they were walking 

down the streets, and they were -- have thes
e quick round-ups. If 
the -- if some body l ooks 
suspicious, you know, a -- a ma le, of course, they
 would take him around the corner and let him 
drop his pants, you know, to check to see whet
her he was circumcised. Now circumcision was 
like a hundred percent giveaway in Poland, which 
is very hard to understand here, because I 

mean we know that -- and I -- I-I know the trend t
oday is ma ybe not to do it as much, but I know 
that vi rtually -- and especially the United Stat
es, I mean, mer -- many hun -- millions of men are 
circumcised, of whatever background, wha -- you 
know, right? Whether it™s Muslim or ca -- or 
Catholic, Protestant and so forth. In Poland, th
is was not done. In fact
, I reme mber hearing a 
story that if some one who wa
s not Jewish was circumcised, had to have some  iron proof 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
68 
 
 
documentation that for me dical reasons, and wh
atever -- I don™t know whether that person, you 
know, ever -- how he -- how they -- they ma naged to
 sur -- to -- to live, 
you know, to have -- to 
prove that -- that he was not 
Jewish, because that was -- they
 would -- there was no questions 
asked, you know. I mean, that was it. Was kind of ir
onical. In fact, in fact, 
I heard of cases where 
some Jewish men tried to go thr
ough surgery to create some  kind of 
false foreskin, or enlarge the 
skin, which always failed, you know, in order to hi
de the fact they were circumcised. You ma y 
have heard about that. So that was another fact
, and now come April 1943
, the ghetto uprising in 
Warsaw. And I was not far from the ghetto in term
s of -- of being able to
 actually see the smoke 
and the shooting. And some ti me s I would see a colu
mn of me  -- of people, of Jews from the 
ghetto being ma rched out for -- obviously to be
 taken some where to a transport, to a 
concentration camp. And I believe th
at lasted for about three or f
our, three weeks or so, when the 
ghetto was obviously destroyed, a
nd -- and that wa -- that ma de a tremendous impact on me , I 
mean I was -- I ki nd of felt helpless.
 I -- I felt -- that was when I rea
lly felt a sense of great guilt, 
that here I wa s, you know, on the outside, you know
, and I was getting away with it, and here 
were these people [indecipherable] they were fi
ghting for thei r lives a
nd so forth, there was 
nothing I could do about it. I mean, I certainly wa
sn™t brave enough, or thinking that I would just 
run into the ghetto and join them, you know. That
 would have tote -- it would have been -- you 
know, I mean I -- you had to try to survive, you k
now, and tha -- and that 
was my fortune that I 
was able to be on the other side, even though not
 knowing what the next day would bring for me , 
you know. So that was very bad, that was -- th
at was -- and we knew 
about it actually, you know, 
that was known that it was a ghetto uprising, 
even though there wasn™t much talked about it 
where I worked, you know. But peop -- that -- y
ou know, there wa -- it was known that there was 
an uprising in the ghetto. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464

Q: And did you hear things about the ghetto prio
r to the uprising, and about the deportations? I 
mean, by this time, is it clear to you that there are death camps, or you still don™t know? 
A: Yes, I did know about it. I did know about a 
death camp of Auschwitz, because -- because the 

son of the ow -- well, the woma n who was -- of th
e -- of the fi rm, she was a common law wife of 
this -- this master of the shop. Her son was actua
lly a Pole. He  was in -- he was in Auschwitz for 
a short while, they had a section for non-Jews, 
you know, near -- near 
ausch -- Auschwitz. And 
he was -- he came back from Auschwitz, and he 
me ntioned that Auschwitz was, you know, there 
was a concentration camp in Auschwitz, and so o
n, so he did talk abou
t that, about -- briefly 
about his experiences. And he said, ﬁOh, there™s 
a lot of Jews there, 
s -- they™re getting all 
killed,ﬂ you know, but -- yeah. 

Q: And you believed this? 

A: Oh yes, oh absolutely. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Absolutely. But I didn™t -- he -- he just me
ntioned that in general, 
you know. So I -- I knew, I 
knew. By that time  I already knew -- knew about th
at there™s a -- there wa
s a concentration camp 
in Auschwitz. 
Q: And by this time, by April ™43, you™re in Wa rsaw for how long? 

A: Well, it was just about -- 

Q: From the  spring of ™42. 

A: -- the spring of ™42, yeah. 

Q: So it™s almost a year? 

A: Al most a year, exactly, exactly, I was there. 

Q: Do you start feeling some what
 safer, or you continue -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
70 
 
 
A: I felt safer in the sense that 
I was kind of established there. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: You know, that I was -- I was accepted, and of cour
se I was -- I was part of that -- of that -- of 
that ambience. I would go to church, you know, I -- 
I -- I -- my -- this kid who -- who was with 
me , Janek, you know, we learned how to skip
 confession, you know, when -- cause the woma n, 
she was very, very religious, so she was chas
e us out, you know, always to go to church on 
Sunday. So we went in and out, you know, cause a 
kid was not interested. And when the time  
was for confession we would go to the -- prete
nd like to the confession, we found a booth that 
wasn™t occupied, so we pretended like we 
are at the -- you know, doing confe -- going into 
confession, kneeling there, you know, and then af
ter a little while, you know, cro -- go up, cross 
ourselves, and -- and leave, you know. So -- so I was 
kind of accepted as part 
of the -- of that -- 
of that working family, as it were. But -- but 
I was always, alwa ys, al
ways concerned about 
discovery. I wa -- that was always on my mi nd. 
Why?  Because -- because 
there were the -- the 
customers who came in, there were a lot of secret
 police guys that came  in to pick up holsters, 
there were -- and -- and -- and they saw me
 working, you know, and all that. And you never 

knew who would kind of look at me  and say wait a 
mi nute, this kid looks more like -- he must be 
Jewish, or some thing like that. You know, or he 
looks Jewish, or -- even though I really didn™t, 
you know. But who knows, you know, I mean you -- you never knew that, what would happen. 

So -- so I was -- there™s always that -- thatlingering concern, as it we
re, on my mi nd you know, 
and fear as well, that I ma y be 
discovered. But of course, I had a 
much easier time of it than -- 
than like -- than say my brother was in the 
-- in the camp, you know, so I was -- felt -- felt in 
some  ways fortunate that -- you know,
 that I was where I was, you know -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
71 
 
 
Q: We re you ever in a situati
on where you came close -- someone came close to seeing that you 
were circumcised?  
A: No. 

Q: No. So you were very caref
ul how you dressed and undressed -- 
A: Careful how I dress and undress and all that, a
nd don™t forget I -- we never -- we never based 
[indecipherable] always had this
 -- you know there were just a 
-- just you wash your -- th-the 
lower part of your body didn™t get much -- much
 sanitation as it were, you know. You just 
washed the upper body, the feet or legs
 and this and that, so -- so 
I never -- th-there -- there was 
no -- there was no shower, you know, and then -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- or bath or anything like that
. But -- but when I undress, sure, 
at night, dressi -- undressing 
and dressi ng, always -- because that was there, it 
was there, I -- I knew, I was aware of it, and -- 
and there was no doubt about it, that -- 
Q: And nobody questioned you that you were doing so
me  -- you were dressing and undressing in 
a way -- 

A: Not at all, no -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- you see, that was why I had 
to learn to be very casual about
 it, you know, that™s one of the 
things that the -- the -- the survival instincts,
 I guess, teaches you. At the same  ti me  I had to 
behave casually and at the same  time in a 
guarded way, you know. And 
with ke -- you know, I 
lived on the -- you know, in -- in 
the loft there, and that was dark, you know, and we would 
climb up the ladder and go to -- go to slee
p. You know, you don™t -- when you™re young you 
don™t sleep tha -- you don™t need that much sleep, so it was very late, usua
lly in the evening, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
72 
 
 
-- and so forth, and I -- and then on Sundays we 
were free, and -- and I reme mber one incidence 
which remi nds me  that one of the friends of th
is -- this owner of the firm, by the name  of 
Boleslaw Konarski was the owner, he -- she 
ran the business, only he was kind of a -- an 
alcoholic, you know, would go on two, three daybinges, was away, you know. And then would 
come  back home with -- you know, with -- with 
no -- penniless and all th
at. And one of his 
friends once came in, I believe, and he ma de a co
mment in Polish what really scared me . He 
says, ﬁHe must be -- he must be 
part Jewish,ﬂ to this Boleslaw 
Konarski. Just like that. He is 
from a Jew, in Polish, he said. [indecipherable] he
 must be some what from a Jew. He  didn™t say I 
was Jewish, but ma ybe fr om a Jew. And then 
Boleslaw said, oh come  on, no, no. Do not be 

ridiculous. So me thing like that. That was the end of
 that. That was another true incident. I still 
reme mber the way the words that he used. I think 
he is a little bit of a 
-- from a Jew. But other 
than that -- and then -- so these sights in Wa
rsaw were very, very, very bad, you know, they -- 
they -- they -- this whole idea of
 a -- of -- just consta
nt round-ups of peopl
e. But life went on, 
you know, and Wa rsaw is a very, very busy cit
y. And then I befriended a fa mily who a r e 

relatives of the owner of this -- of this -- of 
this pl -- workshop. There was a fa mily of four 
daughters living ap -- in a small, lit
tle village outside of Wa rsaw, on 
the other side of the Vistula, 
on the roo -- east bank of the Vistula, near Praga.
 Praga was ba sically part
of Wa rsaw, it was -- 
it™s called Praga, not Prague, Czech
oslovakia, Praga. Wa s like part of the Warsaw, but that was 
called Praga, which was the -- was one side of the 
-- of the river. And there was one -- one of the 
daughters who I was very smitten with, she was about two, three years olde r. 

Q: This is Da nka? 

A: Danka, Danielle, Danka, exactly. And -- and I 
guess that saved me  -- saved my life , that my 
knowledge of Danka wi ll save  my life, too. B
ecause I would visit them occasionally on -- on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
73 
 
 
Sundays I would go out there with the commute
r railroad, ma ybe a 15 mi nute trip. And the 
father, he wa s a carpenter, and there were four
 daughters. And I [indecipherable] I befriended her 

and we were very friendly and I was -- so I w
ould stay there for the da
y, some  days overnight 
and take a very early -- early 
commuter back into the city. A
nd I think this was going on for 
about ma ybe six, seven months and one weeken
d, one weekend -- not weekend, but it was a sun 
-- I think it was late Saturday maybe, I was able 
to get away. I was there, and the next day the 
Polish uprising broke out in Wa rsaw. Here I am
 again, no belongings, no 
clothing, just visiting 
this family. No way to get back to Warsaw b
ecause it was the uprising, wa s the Polish uprising. 
Was a ma ssive, ma ssive uprising in August of 1944. 
Huge uprising. The city
 was just -- I mean, 
oh my God, I mean it was tremendous -- you could act
ually hear it, even 10 - 12 miles away, you 
could hear the explosion and -- and so forth. A
nd the Russians were not -- nearby. They weren™t 
very far at all. Now as you know, what happened 
in the Polish uprising 
was that it lasted for 
about two months. It was totally destroyed. Wa rs
aw the city wa s destroyed. The population was 
evacuated. And if I had stayed 
in Warsaw, who knows what would 
have happened?  I would have 
ma ybe run into the same  business of being ta
ken some where and wo -- to a work camp, ma ybe 
going to another bathhouse, or who the hell kno
ws what, you know. Or killed ma ybe in the 
uprising itself, cause it was a very ma ssive 
uprising. Tens of thousa
nds you know, of -- of 
underground force there. But we were just obser
vers from th -- you know, from the suburbs, as -- 
you know. And this co -- this oh -- this -- this fa
ther of that fa mily, by the name  of Bozym was 
his last name, B-o-z - dot - y-m, Bozym. There was 
an fi eld ar tillery unit, a German fi eld artillery 
unit camped right in that little village up the hi
ll to [indecipherable] farm. You know, what they 
would do, they would just  -- wherever they want 
they just took over a farm, killed the -- the -- 
you know, confiscated the -- the --
 the -- the livestock you know, 
and butchered it for their own 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
74 
 
 
use, and so on. So they a -- took over the farm
. And Mr. Bozym was a [indecipherable] that was 
looking for work obviously, to do some thing, and that
 field artillery unit n
eeded some repairs to 
be ma de on their -- some  of their storage equipmen
t, whatever it was. And he took with me  as an 
assist ant, an apprentice. Not apprentice, but an 
assistant. So we worked there for a few days 
while this was still going on in Wa rsaw. And we
 worked a circular saw. Equipment was very 
rusty. There was no guard on the circular saw at 
all. And I had a narrow piece of wood which I 
was trying to cut and I cut off half of my finger 
on it. Okay?  And the blade 
clo -- was so close to 
this, I almost lost a second fi
nger, too. Cut my fi nger and I wa
s bleeding. So the German who 
was in charge, the staff -- staff sergeant there, 
grabbed one of -- grabbed a -- a car, and took me  -
- and they asked one of the s-sold
iers there to take me  to the fi
eld hospital, which was only about 
ma ybe a mi l e  away, th-the German field hospital,
 because that finger was still hanging on it, you 
know, it wasn™t cut off completely, just hanging, ju
st by the skin. So here I am in the German 
field hospital with all these 
wounded from the f -- the front was nearby -- wounded, and I was 
sitting there waiting cause ther
e were m -- there were priori
ties, you know, there were people 
with li -- you know, all ki
nds of, you know, with -- with si -- ma jor operations and all that, and I 
was waiting my turn. So they looked at me , they 
grabbed me because this German said, well this 
is a Polish worker that worked 
those -- and they cut off the rest 
of that finger, and they dropped 
my pants because they gave me  a shot. You 
know, it was a form of either antibiotic, or 
some thing, for just a mi nute. And I was turned
 away from the guy who gave me  the shot, you 

know, just on that side. And here I am 
again, exposed, you know. Is somebody watching over 
me ?  I don™t believe it. So me body else mi ght be -- f
eel that way. At any rate -- so I wa s all 
bandaged up, you know, and went back. And -- and this
 was some thing that™s very, very hard to 
believe , but when I went back, and I reported back 
to the -- that -- to th-that German place, this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
75 
 
 
guy asked me to wait. He was the -- the -- hi
s name  was Gabe Reuter -- Gabe Reuter. 
[indecipherable] me ister Gabe Reuter. He was a 
field artillery staff co
mma ndant. And he gave 
me  this piece of paper. Of course, I st -- I kne
w German. And I™ll translat
e for you that piece of 
paper and you won™t believe what it says. It 
said in it, the Polish worker Mieczysl aw 
Wereszczyszyn was injured while working for our unit,
 and he intends after hi s recovery, to join 
the German army as a -- as a volunteer. As a 
volunteer. Now here [indecipherable] nice Jewish 
kid from -- from L™vov, you know, volunteering into th
e German ar my, r i ght?  Now he did that as 
a big favor to me , because he felt by having this 
piece of pape r, I will be able to ge t some , you 
know, privileges, you know, I would ma ybe get some  
bread or some thing. He was -- he just tha -
- totally on his own. I certainly 
wouldn™t have asked him for it. Would never even occurred to 
me . I didn™t even know there was such a thing as 
being able to volunteer into the German ar my, 
but ma ybe by that time they were desperate 
for volunteers because, you know, the front was 
moving, they were movi ng, moving, moving, you know, 
west. So here I have this docume nt, 
now -- now I™m a real, true Aryan with a -- with
 a -- with a Kennkarte, you know, and on top of 
that, I have this document that says here is
 a live wire for the German ar my, you know. And 
actually th-that did help
 me . I was able to get some  bread
 from some  of t he German youths, 
cause we were scrounging for food, a nd I would s
how it, and I -- and I wore this for a long, long 
time, even after I was healed pretty much, I st
ill wore this, you know, 
in a kind of, you know, in 
a sling, as a -- you know, right? A
nd I actually helped the famil
y, you know, that they -- the -- 
the family, because I was able to get so me bread, a
nd etcetera. So that was my -- my injury, as it 
were, you know, and fortunately I didn™t get an in
fection because, you know, with the bandages 
and so here I am as a -- so that wa
s ano -- anot her close call that I had.  
Q: I think we  have to stop the tape now. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
76 
 
 
A: Okay. 
Q: And to go the next tape. 
End of Tape Five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
77 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: I want to go back a little bit, before the --
 the uprising on the -- on the -- on the Aryan side -- 
Polish side. You have no contact 
with your fa mily, I take it 
A: None whatsoever. 
Q: None whatsoever. 

A: None whatsoever. 

Q: So you hear nothing -- 

A: I had no idea who li -- who survived. I ha-h
ad no -- no knowledge on 
-- I didn™t know about 
my brother, I didn™t know about my father, a
bout Genya, Helen, my mother. I knew that my 
mother, of course, was not in L™vov because sh
e left, yo -- you know, when the Russians arrived, 
she left for the small town where she origina
lly came  from, Ta rnogrod. 
So I had absolutely no 
contact whatso -- it was impossible. 

Q: Did -- did Zaremba fi -- the fi
 -- husband and wife keep in t
ouch with you at all, or once you 
got to the leather factory -- 

A: Oh, I would visit them occasionally. 

Q: You wou l d? 

A: Yeah. But I tried to avoid that. I -- I knew that
 they were not necessarily that comfortabl e and 
I -- and I was -- you know, when I --
 when I would see them, they 
were friendly but
 I didn™t feel 
like they were saying, we ll, why don™t you come  
back tomorrow, have dinner with us, anything 

like that, you know. So -- so afte
r awhile I just -- just didn
™t bother to stop there. 
Q: So they were the only people 
in Warsaw to know who you were? 
A: The only people. The 
only people who knew.  
Q: Did you ever think any of the other boys
 in the leather factory were Jewish? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
78 
 
 
A: Oh, definitely not. 
Q: They definitely weren™t? 

A: Oh, no, no, no, there™s no way, no, no. 

Q: No. 

A: No, I mean -- I mean, I -- I 
-- I don™t th -- I -- I can™t imag
ine -- I don™t know how ma ny there 
were, I don™t know whether there™s any record of it. 

Q: Right. 

A: As to how ma ny Jewish boys ac
tually survived in Wa rsaw as
 Aryans. I really don™t know, I 
have no record of it. In fact, 
I don™t know whether the museum ma
y have a record of any -- any 
who survived that way. 

Q: Right, I mean -- 

A: I know wome n -- 

Q: Yes, more -- 
A: -- some  wome n had a better time  of it -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- because they didn™t have that problem
. And actually some  wome n even ended up in 
Germany in work ca -- in wor -- as workers. That I know. 

Q: That™s right. 

A: But men -- male -- male Jews, I -- I cer
tainly am not aware 
of it at all, no. 
Q: Did you become  close with any of these boys in
 any way?  No. You we re 
always afraid to -- 
A: We ll, we were close only in the 
sense that we are co-workers, you know -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
79 
 
 
A: -- that we worked together, and we w
ould just go, you know, have some fun outside, you 
know, ma ybe a -- had a little money so we would 
buy some  ice cream or anything like that. But 
we never talked about ourselves, we never 
talked about our -- our 
-- you know, anything like 
that, no. There was only one left. I mean, there we
re two more, but then towards -- later on, there 
was only one other boy that was 
with me  in [indecipherable] 
Q: And all the rest were -- 
A: And the rest were all the adu
lt workers, the journeymen, yeah. 
Q: I see. So, essentially you were alone. 

A: Oh absolutely. 

Q: All this whole time. 

A: Well, I -- until -- until I met 
Danka, you know, of course -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- and that helped, you know, I had -- I had 
a family to go to, you know, and -- and so forth. 
And I was welcome there, you know, and 
-- and they were very friendly. 
Q: And does sh -- did she ever 
ask you questions about your f -- 
A: Oh no. 

Q: No. 

A: She didn™t know that either. She didn™t know. 

Q: So she didn™t ask you about your fa mily? 

A: We ll, I would me ntion that, you know, th
at I was a half orphan from a small -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- you know, but to -- but you know, to the Po
les in Wa rsaw, lo -- Tarnopol was like -- like, 

you know, the -- the -- the -- an unknown world, pr
actically, you know, cause 
this was the capital 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
80 
 
 
of the city, you know, it™s like 
-- it™s like talking about ma ybe
 a -- you know, like New Yorker 
east of the Hudson, you know, type of thing, you know
, a -- a small town some where. So they 
were -- there wasn™t that -- that important to th
em at all, because they knew that I was working 
for the firm, and I was there alr
eady for awhile, and -- and --  
Q: You didn™t -- 
A: -- I was learning a trade, you know, 
it™s -- and stuff like that, you know. 
Q: Did you grow up -- grow up very fast, or di
d you feel by the time you were 13, given what 
you had gone through, you were sort of adult by then? 

A: Oh yeah, I felt grown up, sure I did.  

Q: You did? 

A: Oh yeah, I -- I certainly did. And -- and the 
interesting part too, sp
eaking I -- I made a -- 
allusions to German, my German language. I l earned how to speak a broken German Polish, you 

know, just -- in other words, I -- just throwing 
in a word of German here and there, which was 
known that some  kids would learn German in 
public school. So instead of really speaking 

German the way I knew German, since I also li
ved in Danzig, you ma y recall, I would kind of 
speak a broken [indecipherable] German, which 
helped me  also to get some  bread, you know, 
from the Germans or some food when I had my -- 
my paper as a vol -- as a future volunteer, you 
know, in German ar my. So that was also kind of 
-- I -- I kind of thought th
at was really funny in 
some  ti me s, because here I am trying to speak, straining to speak Germa n, you know, a few 

words here and there, to ingratiate myself 
so I could, you know, get some  food. But then of 
course, trouble began again because the front wa
s approaching. Now, you may recall that the 
Russians deliberately stopped on the outskirts 
of Praga because the Wa rsaw uprising was not 
sponsored by the Communist Polish exiled re
gime , by the London regime , okay?  Which was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
81 
 
 
which was the -- the -- th-the other side. So 
they decided, and it™s, 
I think, historically 
documented, to let the Poles kill themselves, you 
know, before they had their own Polish army, 
which is part of the Russian army, take Wa rsaw
. And of course, that was a complete catastrophe, 
disaster because of course the -- the Polish upr
ising finally failed, and the Germans regained, you 
know, the -- the -- the front and so forth. And wh
ile the uprising was finished by -- perhaps by 
beginning of October, started in August, the -- 
the pol -- the -- the -- the Russians began to 
advance towa rds the Vistula River, and we had 
to leave, you know, they 
had to evacuate all the 
civilian population. And that™s w
hy really tough time s started, t
oo. That wa s another period of 
great hunger for us, because we crossed the -- we
 had to cross the river,
 into -- onto the other 
side, you know, because the Russian was -- were
 advancing. And that was still during the 
uprising it™s se -- that happen, because the Ru
ssians were mo ving -- inching up. And I reme mber 
like today, we are walking through a field and 
all of a sudden we saw these thousands of 
parachutes, what looked like thousan
ds of parachutes, which was one
 of those big drops that the 
allied -- you know, the Americans dropped on Wa
rsaw. And as you know, 90 percent or more of 

it fell into the German ha nds. That was one of thos
e terrible, terrible blun
ders, you know, of the -
- of the -- of this whole operation. And wa -- wh
ere the -- where the Polis
h resistance hoped to 
get all of that  -- all these amm
unition supplies and the Germans got 
all pri -- virtually all of it. 
And actually, we were wal -- as we were walkin
g, we saw th -- the sky was almost dark. There 
must have been thousands of these drop -- of 
the parachutes comi ng down. So that was one -- 
another experience. And -- and then
 we tried to walk fr om one vi
llage to another village, trying 
to get some  food, we we re hungry. In fact, I w -- 
the one episode is where we actually -- I slept 
on the cemetery, you know, on the na -- on the graves, you know, because we had no other pl ace 

to sleep. It was cold. And -- and that was a ve ry tough time. We were very, very -- we had no

food. We  maybe ate once a day. Some ti me s we w
ould eat some -- some pot
atoes and -- and then 
-- and cucumbers there was [indecipherable] 
Q: And you were with Danka and her fa mily [indecipherable] 

A: I was with the family, right
, right. The -- there was -- ther
e was Danka and her sister -- 
younger sister. The two oldest sisters went away 
and they -- they -- they went separately 
some where. And there were there just  the parent
s and the -- and the two sisters and myself. And 
there were ot her families, you know, some ti me s we went a group together. And some times the -- 

the -- the local farmers would take pity on us a
nd let us sleep in the barn, you know, and there 
was no food, and -- and -- and I reme mber wh
ere there was a cow, soon enough the Germans 

came and took away the far mer™s cow, you know, so
 there was no -- no milk, and -- and no food, 
so it was very, very tough. And that lasted th
rough that period of -- of -- of December and 
January, just the begin -- towards the end of 
December, and one night we wake up and who do 

we see?  Russians, on their trucks, you know?  Then 
I said to myself, okay, I™m alive. I ma de it. I 
ma de it. January 1945 is when Wa rsaw is liberat
ed, finally, after being 
totally wiped out. And I 
never told the fa mily that I was Jewish, but I di
d tell Danka that I was. 
And she wasn™t shocked. 
Was surpri -- I would never -- she may have been 
s-surprised. But I soon r
ealized that actually 
this was not a -- a true lang -- 
lasting roma nce. You know, she wa
s older than I, and what was 
infatuation was not really a -- a re
al -- some thing that it was going 
to last, even though I would, if 
she were willing, I probably would have want it to
 last, ma ybe, at -- at that time, anyway. And -- 
and there were different Russians from the Ru
ssians that were, you know, retreating in -- in 
1941, I me a n, those were victorious Russians. And th
ey were trying to give out food, and finally 
got -- we got some  food from the -- from one of 
the -- some  of the Russians, they were friendly. 
They could -- they recognized right away the 
-- what the -- they didn™t know whether they were

83 
 
 
Jews, necessary, but they -- they could see they
™re -- they™re refugees 
and just hungry, starvi ng 
people, and all that. So -- so that™s ho
w -- how I ended being Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn. 
Q: And became Mundek -- 
A: And became Mundek Wertma n again, you know, later on. 

Q: But you had no papers to say that you were Wertma n. 

A: I had no papers. I had no papers. They had to
 take my word for it, the Jewish author ity, 
Jewish agency, you know, had to take my word fo
r it. My first notion was obviously to try to 
find fa mily. And the mo veme nt of the front was 
such that the -- ther e was constantly Russians 
driving back and forth in their trucks, so forth. So
 I left  the fam -- the --  the -- the Bozy m fa mily, 
jumped on one of the trucks and just went east, 
you know. And my intention was to go to Lublin 
because L™vov was already taken over by the Russians there, and they had a border, you know, 

they -- they -- they di d not let people in, so
 L™vov became -- you know, they annexed L™vov to 

the -- to the Ukrainian Republic, even at that  ti
me they already established a -- a border. But I 
knew I had an uncle in Lublin, 
oneof my father™s brothers, 
who had a bakery. And of my 
father™s four brothers and a sister, I only knew tw
o of the -- of his siblings. One was the uncle in 
Lublin, and the other one was the sister on to 
-- To ma szow, because when I was a little boy I 
would visit her. The other three brothers I ne
ver me t. And they were spread out, you know, in 
different parts of Poland. And I reme mber checking 
into Lublin, and already at -- by that time  -- 
and it ma y have been weeks -- few weeks after, 
they already had some  es tablished now, the 
Jewish agencies started to -- you know, to help
 out, you know, in establishing a registry of 
survivors. There was the HIAS, H-I-A-S, and 
the AJDC, you know, it [indecipherable] agency. 
And there was a registry and I went into this re 
-- first I was asking about my uncle and they said 
no, he is de -- he is -- he is not al -- he peri
shed, you know, they didn™t ha
ve any record of hi m. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
84 
 
 
And then I checked with the regi
stry and lo and behold I see my
 father™s name . I see Genya™s 
name , I see my brother™s name , I see Helen™s na
me  and I see my cousin™s name , my -- my -- you 
know, my c ousin™s. I just couldn™t
 believe it. I thought ma ybe this 
was registry of the dead, not 
of the living. And they had an address there, 
and I went there and sure enough, there wa s Genya, 
and there™s Helen. And my father wasn™t in on th
at day. And that was the 
first time that I took a 
real bath in I don™t know how many years, three y
ears, four years, a real bath, because I was 
really dirty. And -- and then I found out the stor
y as to how my father survived, and how my 
brother survived. And I didn™t 
know anything about my mother. 
There was no -- no -- no record 
of it until -- much later I found out
 what happened to her. And the way my father survived was 
that before the ghetto closed in July, I believe 
-- in June, I believe, in 1943, when the ghetto was 
closed, just before it closed, my
 father arranged with a Polish 
vegetable gardener to be hidden. 
And of course he paid them m
oney for it. But he had some  money stashed away, he would pay 
monthly because he was afraid to gi ve  him up 
front because the guy would probably spend it and 
-- you know, and so forth. And for 18 months my fa
ther didn™t see the su
n, the daylight. He was 
hidden there with Genya, Helen was 
given away, and with that cousin, with this Chana Koch, in 
a small area, was like a cubicle.
 And was given food ma ybe like once a day or some thing. The 
gardener would bring food. And in that same  build
ing there were Germa n railroad workers that 
actually lived in that building. And they were sepa
rated just by a very thin wall from t he places 
where the German railroas -- railroad workers 
would congregate and -- 
you know, and have fun 
and have their -- their drinking parties and all kind
s of things. So he had to keep very, very quiet 
when the workers were there. There was no sanita
tion, there was no toilet. Th
ey just -- whatever 
water they could get, they woul
d use that, and -- so -- so they 
ha -- instead of using -- using a 
toilet, you use some thing else and then get rid of it 
at night, da -- in the da
rk of night. My brother

George was fortunate he was able
 to live outsi de the camp itself because he  was on a steamroller 
that I me ntioned before, working it. But toward
s the end of the -- he 
knew what was going on 
because he was outside, so he could hear the -- wh
at they were talking about, th-the guards and 
the -- the Germans and the Ukrainians. He knew 
that the camp was going to be liquidated. And 
he happened to know where my father was hidden 
because one of my fath
er™s friends, who had 
happened to be a Ukrainian, had some contacts
 [indecipherable] in the camp, you know, and he 
was -- communicated with him, so he knew where 
my father was. And on the night that he was 
going to be -- when the camp was liquidated they
 were taking -- he escaped from the caboose of 
that st eamroller while the Germans were waitin
g outside, asking to get dressed, he escaped 
through a rear little window -- it
™s on -- on -- it™s on his tape 
-- and ran away and hid, you know, 
for a couple nights, and joined my 
fat her -- was able to join my 
father in that hidi ng place. And 
he was with my father for a full year, until lib
eration. And the -- and -- and wa -- L™vov was 
liberated, I believe in July of
 ™45. No, not in July of ™45, I™m s orry, no, no, I™m wrong, I™m 
wrong, cause the war ended in May of 1944. It wa
s liberated I think it 
was in -- if I™m not 
mi staken it must have been in 
the -- I have it written down. I th
ink in July of ™44, possibly, ™44. 
He -- so they -- that was a very tough time for th
em, but they ma naged to survive in this hiding 
place. And -- and what ha ppened is they moved t o
 -- to -- to Lublin, my father, you know, moved 
to -- moved to Lublin after -- af
ter the -- the liberati
on, and established himself there -- tried to 
establish hims elf there. And one of my cousins, 
who was a partisan in one of the forests of -- 
near Lublin, which was not far from Tarnogrod wh
en my mother was there, he knew that my 
mother died in a -- in a ma ss shooting, liquidating 
the small remnant of that Jewish community in 
1943. 1943. She worked as a nurse, apparently and th
en that -- so that™s how I found out, cause 
he was one of the survivors, too. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
86 
 
 
Q: And you found this out 
within a year or so? 
A: Right, yeah. These were very chaotic times and 
-- a-and just -- just -- ju
st th-the remnants of 
the survivors and the chaos and 
the -- and the -- trying to find
 survivors, trying to look for 
survivors and -- and as I said 
before, you know, my father had f
our brothers. They all were 
ma rried, had children, and for the -- the two cousin
s, one cousin my father™s brother™s son, and 
they -- my father™s sister™s daughter were the only
 two other of the fa mily 
that acta -- that s -- 
that survived of my father™s family. So -- so 
that was -- you know, of c
ourse, we all looked bad, 
you know, kind of emaci ated and -- but fortunately not
 in terribly bad health at all, you know, 
some how. And when I heard of my mother™s de
ath, you know, that was very hard for me . I was 
really -- it™s kind of a -- hit me  ve
ry hard. Especially in the light of
 the fact that if she had stayed 
with my father, if my father 
didn™t divorce her, because he did it, she woul d have survived. You 
always think about that, you know. And she wa
s so young, 38 years old, you know. She was very 
good to me . Bright, intelligent. Very socially awar
e. My father accused her of being a Socialist, 
which was -- was the strongest insult he could use, you know, cause he wa s obviously not. And 

she st -- he always accused her of being too fr
ee thinking. Too -- too -- too sympathetic to the -- 
to the strikers, to the laborers, you know, to the wo
rkers, and all that. So -- so that was very bad. 
That was a bitter pill, 
especially in the light 
of our very bad relations with the stepmot her, you 
know, it was -- it was very, very bad. That has cau
sed me  a lot of anguish. And you never forget 
that, you know. And on the top of 
it all, after ma ny years when my
 father separated from Genya, 
and they didn™t live -- for [indecipherable] year
s they were separated, he
 would say, ﬁIf I could 
only bring your mother back alive.ﬂ And you know
, I mean that was, you know, if I could only 
do that. So, after so ma ny years he had regrets,
 as it were, you know. So it was -- it wa s pretty 
hard. But -- but it™s ancient hist ory now. Maybe 
not so anci ent for those who still reme mber it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464

Q: It doesn™t seem like ancient hi story. 
A: Hm?  

Q: It doesn™t sound like ancient history -- 

A: Doesn™t sound like it, I know. 

Q: -- when you™re talking. 

A: I know. But I feel blessed being alive, having
 a wonderful family. Having a wife who can put 
up with me . Over 46 years now. 

Q: Right. 

A: Having children, grandchildren. I thought 
I would never live l
ong enough to have 
grandchildren, it™s wonderful to 
have them. And being privileged
 -- and I me an this sincerely, 
not sounding patriotic, over pa -- you know, that 
I am blessed to -- you know
, to live in thi -- in 
this country and -- and f -- and I feel like I™m
 American citizen. I l
ove America. I love 
democracy, and I think for those who went th
rough this, they don™tknow how to appreciate 
democracy. And it™s only natural that we take demo
cracy for granted with all the --  with all the 
weaknesses of it, and with all 
its inherent problems . There™s 
nothing better. There™s nothing 
better than what we have. And hopefully it™s going 
to get even better as time  goes on. I sure hope 
so.

Beginning Ta pe Seven 
Q: Okay. Michael, I want to take you back just 
a little bit because ther
e™s a couple of questions 
that I mi ssed. When you were in 
the Warsaw ghetto, did you hear -- 
A: L -- L™vov ghetto, you mean. 
Q: No, no, no, I mean -- I don™t mean the Wa rsaw ghetto, I me an when you were in Wa rsaw -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- outside of the ghetto. Did you 
hear people talking about Jews? 
A: No. 

Q: Not at all?  Not nasty comments, not
 too bad at what™s happened, nothing? 
A: Nothing. The -- the people that 
I lived with in Warsaw and work
ed with, were basically very 
staunch Polish Nationalists. You know, they -- they
 -- they really hated 
the Germans. And ma ybe 
because of that, they took a sort
 of a stand of they didn™t -- they
 didn™t ex -- they di dn™t want to 
express any anti-Semitic feelings, even though they
 ma y have  harbored them. But I did not hear 
anything really negative per se at
 all about -- about Jews. In fact
, nothing was said about Jews at 
-- at -- in -- in -- during our th -- there was no 
remarks ma de, or cracks ma de about -- about the 
Jews. I don™t know whether I was -- whether the 
Poles in Warsaw perhaps were more -- more 
worldly in a sense, in general, as opposed to
 ma ybe L™vov, which was so heavily uk -- Ukrainian 
and Polish and all this strife and all this c
onstant turmoil. Wa rsaw was more homoge nous in 
terms of the Polish population. Maybe more sophis
ticated, I don™t know. Bu
t I know that -- and I 
didn™t hear this, so it™s not a 
direct answer to your question, 
but -- but during th
e -- the Jewish 
uprising, there was some  help given to the -- to th
e Jewish aba -- by the Poles. So there was some  
contacts ma de with the Polish underground, per se
. And I was not aware that the Poles actually 
helped at all, the Germans to fight the Jewi
sh ghetto, you know. Unlike in L™vov, for example, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
89 
 
 
where -- where there were just vol
unteers galore, you know, to -- to 
help to enter the ghetto. In 
fact, the -- the guards of the -- of the Jewish ghe
tto were actually Estoni
an and Latvians, ma ny of 
them, which I don™t know whether this is well 
known. And the reason for it being is that the 
Latvian and Estonians and L
ithuanians had great hopes fo
r having independent -- you know, 
want to be independent of Russia, you know, 
they always been an -- you know, under the 
Russian thumb, as it were, you know, and so maybe 
that -- some how they felt that that would be 
some  way of -- of ma ybe  getting Germans to give
 them some  independence. In the same ways 
the Ukrainians were hoping that th
ey were -- that the Germans woul
d give them a -- a country -- 
a statehood, or a bas -- or some  kind of independence, some  kind of autonomy. But they were, 
and they were [indecipherable] ferocious, you know, 
from -- so -- so I think perhaps in general, 

ma ybe -- and I don™t know whether this is a fact, this is only my -- my -- my -- my i mpression, 

because I didn™t hear any overt anti-Se mitism 
wi thin my i mme diate surrounding, perhaps this 
was ma ybe typical of -- of ot
her urban Wa rsaw people, you know, of the -- of the urban people, 
the people who live in Warsaw 
itself. Now that is just 
supposition at this point. 
Q: So y -- even when you were hearing and smelling the burning of the ghetto at the uprising, di d 

you -- were you outside, and you -- you would 
see?  And did people look?  I mean -- 
A: I would see -- I would see it
 just walking down the street
, you know, I could see it from a 
distance. But then, you know, life was going on a
nd then as one of those -- you know, I mean, 
there was no -- I didn™t see any crowds of pe
ople cause there -- they 
weren™t doing it anyway, 
they weren™t allowed to do that, there was 
no, you know, congre -- people were not allowed to 
congregate, p -- Poles we re not allowed to do th
at [indecipherable]. But I could see, you know, 
from the distance, I could see the smoke and hear
 some  explosions and hear gunfire and that kind 
of -- kind of stuff, you know?  And that I said 
-- oh, I did see once a column of people being 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
90 
 
 
ma rched away, nearby. I don™t know where I was th
ere, ma ybe I was getting closer because I 
was curious. But I never was actually close enough to
 actually see the ghetto
 wall, per se, or be 
close enough because I -- I didn™t want to do that, 
I was scared, really, to -- 
to get too close to it, 
you know. One thing is to -- to try to avoid it, 
but not -- not to rea
lly, you know, tempt it too 
much, you know, to be -- to be too close to it. 
Q: Right. I can™t even quite imagine what it™s 
like to be passing as non-Jewish, knowing what™s 
happening to the Jews, that they™re -- that th
ere™s sort of no resti
ng place inside yourself. 
A: Of course. Of course there 
isn™t, yeah. It was always very
 bad. I had a terrible -- and my 
problem is I couldn™t show it. 

Q: Right. 

A: I couldn™t share it with anybody. I couldn™t go b
ack to my -- my workplace and look sad or 
look unhappy. I had to pretend like nothing --everything was norma l, you know, I went and did 

my work, you know, and kibbitzed with the -- with
 the guys that I worked with and -- and -- and 
you know, and all that. I mean, these guys were al
l pretty heavy drinkers while they were 
working, and -- and so I had to 
kind of play, you know, be wi -- you 
know, talk na -- shop talk 
and all that. And -- while inside, 
you know, I had this -- this -- th
is horrible, horrible feeling, I 
mean, tha -- it™s almost like reliving some of 
the images of the ghetto, you know, because I was 
away from it for awhile, you know, and then I -- 
I was -- inside I was reliving all of that, you 
know, an-and -- and -- and -- and so forth. And that
 was a terrible feeling of -- of helplessness 
and -- and anguish again. But I ha 
-- I couldn™t do it, I couldn™t -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- ever show anything like that. You see, as 
I mentioned before, I had to watch my step, I had 
to -- on one hand pretend like -- not overcompensate, 
not to be too skittish, too nervous, or ma ke 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
91 
 
 
some  offhand rema rk, you know, which we -- you know, you cou -- you could in a mome nt of -- 
of -- of -- of -- of a strong feeling say some th
ing. I mean, even saying some  few words could -- 
could -- could cause me  a problem -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- so it wasn™t just a ma tter of the anatomy its
elf, but just as important was the actual overt 
behavior, your body language, as it were. Your 
facial expression. You know
, I -- yeah, I -- I -- I 
had to be this innocent, sort 
of this -- this -- 
this apprentice kid, you know, the one that was 
kicked around by the -- by the -- by the -- by 
the journeymen, you know, pushed around and -- 
and so forth, you know, and scolded for doing ba
d work or -- or whatever, you know. Take all 
that -- that tough talking, you know, and -- well --
 and that™s -- was pa
rt of the training, you 
know, to keep you in line, you know, to -- not to
 ma ke you feel like you know what you™re 
doing. And -- and concentrating on it, you know, while
 thinking about that, doing all your work, 
you™re not ma king mi stakes, you know, you didn™t want 
to ruin the piece of leather, it was very 
precious. 

Q: Right. 

A: You see, I mean to -- to cut something 
up and make -- you cut a 
pattern you know, and you -- 
you ma ke a long cut, you know, you™re in big troubl
e. Or -- you know. So -- 
so that was -- that™s 
the [indecipherable] with being a chameleon, you 
know, you try to -- to change your -- you try to 
reme mber to -- to -- how to -- to 
-- the pretense. And that is -- 
that™s wearing. And as I said, I 
mean, you know, I was fortunately young enough to be 
able to -- to handle 
it, and -- and so I™ll 
play along and play the game .  

Q: Did you like that work at all? 

A: I find it interesting. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
92 
 
 
Q: Did you? 
A: Cause I work with my hands. It was -- it 
was -- in a way it was [indecipherable] I could 
concentrate on. I had to concentrate to learn it
. After awhile it became sort of automa tic, you 
know, and in some  cases mi ndless, you know, you just did it, because you learne d how to do it, 

but -- but for awhile -- took a long 
time to learn. And it was hard work, too. So -- so that part of 
it was -- was actually very fortunate becauseit -- it took time , you know, and you kill time  by 

doing it, and -- and you -- you glad you -- you -- 
you done with it, you know, when you™re done. 
And -- and I didn™t want to show off l i ke I knew 
better, or I did it better 
than the other kid or 
some thing. I had to keep in line, just do my --my 
work and -- and try to be modest about it, and -
- not that I was necessarily that
 skilled, but I mean, I -- I learne
d. You know, I -- I applied myself 
to it, in fact, probably more than maybe the othe
r kid because I wanted to -- to do a good job, you 
know, so they would keep me  instead of kick
ing me  out and saying go back to Zaremba, you 
know, we don™t want you. Which c
ould have happened any time. 
Or if they didn™t have enough 
work, they ma y have just said, hey go. I don™t know
 what would have happened if they said -- 
whether the Zarembas would take me back or 
not, you know, or else -- who knows?  So -- so I 

really had to kind of walk a thin
 line, you know, just to be sure 
of doing that. In fact, pretending 
sort of like I was more -- 
more, you know, like I didn™t have all that good education, you know, 
and I was more of a -- perhaps more of a 
simple, you know, kid, you know
, learning a trade. 
Q: So you were pretty entrepreneurial in your 
own way, weren™t you, a littl
e bit like your father 
in -- 

A: Oh, in some  --  

Q: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
93 
 
 
A: -- in some  ways, oh sure, I had to kind of al
ways -- I had to always sharpen my wits, as it 
were, you know, I have to be always aware of it. 
But again, being careful, 
being very careful. It 
was tough. You never knew for sure whether you we
re doing the right thing or not. I -- e -- I 
even had some  -- some  concerns about get
ting too -- too involved with Danka, you know, 
because who -- who n -- who knows what -- if she found out. You know, if I had ma ybe all of a 

sudden spilled my guts, you know, because I had to 
talk to some body. I a n -- had a need to share 
my feelings, my anguish, my -- my c oncern and -- but
 -- but I -- I felt I -- 
somehow I -- I -- I felt 
comfortable about it, eventually you know, and --
 and she didn™t ask me  too ma ny cract -- too 
ma ny questions, too ma ny de -- it was more like a casual sort of you know, friends who just -- 

who pass time  and -- and so forth. There wasn™t mu
ch to do really. I don™t think I ever went to 
any movie or anything. They had a lot of movi
e theaters there with the German propaganda. I 
think I may have seem maybe one. 

Q: Oh, you did? 
A: I -- once I think I did. I saw one
. But there was always this concern about th -- because the -- 
the -- the -- the underground was -- th
ere were -- they were using 
some times explosives in the 
movies too, there -- there would be
 -- trouble began very soon -- 
not too -- not too long before 
the uprising, things were stir
ring, you know, and there was all ki
nd of -- all kind of problems. 
Because again the -- the Polish underground was ver
y, very tough and very strong at -- in its 
beginnings, you know. Was a real hi
storical fiasco, the whole 
thing was just incredible. 
Q: W- We re you surprised that Danka was not surpri
sed that you were Jewish when you told her? 
A: Well, I didn™t have a cha 
-- I didn™t really discuss it with her that  much -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
94 
 
 
A: -- you know. When I me ntion it to
 her, I just said to her, a
nd -- and she -- she didn™t sound -- 
she ma y have been surprised, ma ybe she didn™t wa nt to get involved too 
much in it. But my 
desire to leave and see my -- find my relatives
 was so strong that I 
didn™t -- I don
™t think I 
lingered long enough to really get into it. I don
™t know whether she had 
told her parents or 
whatever. She ma y not even me ntion anything to
 them about it, I don™t 
know. Did she think I 
would come  back and maybe -- or some thing?  I 
don™t know either. We  didn™t have much -- any 
contact after that. It was in a 
different world, you know, I mean --  
Q: Right. 
A: -- I -- I -- I was no longer Mieczyslaw 
We reszczyszyn, you know, he was -- I was Mundek 
Wertman again, you know. Was a na -- I -- I knew that I was an -- I knew -- my old -- I became 

my own identity as it were, you know. And -- and 
my major thing was to find family, to find my 
mother, to find relatives, and to -- but -- but in 
one experience, the Wa rsaw experience, one thing 
that it taught me  in a kind of a [indecipherable] 
very unusual way, is that I had an opportunity to 
live with a Gentile fa mily, which was totally alie
n to me . And I lear ned how the othe r peoples -- 
you know, how to learn, I mean I -- 
I think that sort of those 
germs of human -- humanism kind 
of began to -- to -- to -- to take root  in 
my psyche as it were, because -- because they were 
people, they were a -- th
ey were pe -- they were not Jewi
sh, but they were people who -- who -- 
ma ny of them had -- had the good qualities about
 them. They were warm, and human, you know. 
And so that experience was in some  ways also ki
nd of interesting, it kind of gave me  another 
dime nsion as it were, you know, that I was not --
 while living in -- in L™vov, you know, I wasn™t 
isolat ed in terms of the big cit
y, I me a n, I could see other people
. But our social life was totally 
Jewish, you know. I didn™t have a
ny non-Jewish friends. The only 
non-Jews were the pre -- pe-
people that worked for my father, because I wa
s encouraged -- you know, th
a-that was not -- that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
95 
 
 
was not the style of life at that time  at all, 
you know. There was in some  ways a social ghetto, if 
you -- if you know what I mean, whi c h ma ybe some
 viewers mi ght not appreciate that comment, 
but -- but that™s what it was. 
Q: Right. 

A: So that gave me  that addi
tional -- additional dime nsion that
 I brought back with me. And of 
course, the fact that z -- Zaremba knew, that also l-
lasted with me  as a fact that he was a Polish -- 
Q: Who didn™t denounce you. 

A: -- who -- who didn™t denounce me, who didn™t in
form on me, and his wife. And of c ourse 
there were other cases, like my brother, who ha
d a Ukrainian far mer nearby, near the camp, that 
was helping, that was some  -- of some  assistan
ce. Unfortunately there wa sn™t enough of them, 
you know, because if there were ma ny of them, more had -- would have survived, of course, you 

know. So -- so that was the situa
tion there. And as I me ntioned before, when we went back to 
Lublin, these were very chaotic times, there were
 people going back and forth and trying to find 
each other and -- and we were greatly helped,of course, by the refugee or ganizations, you know, 

by the Jewish agency and so forth, and -- a
nd people just didn™t know what to do with 
themselves, you know, the survivors, you know, they 
were -- there was no job, this -- that they 

could get jobs, or they established businesses, or
 reclaime d businesses. I 
mean, the Polish --  the 
Polish governme nt itself was -- was virtually nonexis
tent, I mean trying to establish -- their own 
country were destroyed really, I mean the dest
ruction was enormous in ma ny cities. Kraków -- 
Kraków was spared, basically, bu
t -- but L™vov was dama ged badl
y, Lublin was all bombed, and 
-- and ma ny of the cities and -- so the destru
ction was enormo us because the Russians in 1939 
when they came  in, they were, you know, there 
was bombardment there, you know, because they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
96 
 
 
invaded Poland from the east, so there was so
me  fighting going on then, [indecipherable] the 
Germans from the west, you know. Polish 
had that -- has that geographic -- 
Q: Misfortune. 
A: -- mi sfortune of being buffeted by --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- by all these things, you know, by -- being from all sides, you know, like -- which is one of 

the curses of -- of the --of -- of the Polish existence 
as it were, you know. So -- 
Q: Wa s it easy for you to adjust to
 being Michael again, or Mundek? 
A: Mundek? 

Q: Mundek. 

A: Was not very hard.  

Q: Wasn™t very -- 

A: Not very hard, because I knew that the ot her 
one was a temporary thing. It wasn™t real me , 
you know. So Mundek came  back very, very easily to me . I didn™t have any problem with that at 

all. 

Q: Do you reme mber the first time that
 you saw your father after the war? 
A: Yeah, I do reme mber when I saw him.  

Q: Wa s he shocked to s -- that you were alive? 

A: We ll, he was -- he heard about
 it. He was out of town but so
me body already told him that and 
-- and of course this was very -- 
it wa s very, very emotional, he was very -- it was quite a -- quite 
a remoti -- emotional thing because he went -- he 
didn™t have  any idea as to what happened, and I 
guess deep inside he probably was ve ry proud of the fact that what he did succeeded.  

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
97 
 
 
A: You know?  You know, that was -- 
Q: Even mo re than you [i ndecipherable] 

A: Exactly, oh no, yeah, to him I™m sure that 
was a great personal vict
ory, you know, that he -- 
that -- that his plan worked out
, you know, that -- that succeeded 
in that. But -- but oh sure, I 
mean, you know, the fact that that was a -- it was ami racle in itself, just being able to -- to see 

each other and say hey, we ma de it, as 
opposed to so ma ny others who did not. 
Q: Right. 

A: But what really grieved me  and -- and -- and --
 and enormously, is the fact that I couldn™t find 
any of my s c hoolma tes, and I couldn™t find -- 
you know, that -- that -- that -- and you didn™t 
know this until the war ended, until you were liberate
d, so all that loss of a
ll these -- I didn™t reali 
-- I di dn™t have to de -- until the -- the actual 
liberation, I had no idea of the enormity, of the 
scope and the enormity of this annihilation of 
people, you know?  I just had no -- no concept, no -
- I knew about camps, I knew about this, I knew
 about the -- the -- th
e -- the -- the Wa rsaw 
ghetto, of course, but I -- I just 
some how in my mi nd, I -- I didn™t rea
lly have that -- that -- that -- 
that concept of this -- th
is -- this enormity of that -- of that
 thing, especially wh
ere the -- with all 
the families of my father, or all these -- these schoolmates and classmates and the --  and kids that  

I, for years you know, played with and grew up 
with and went to school with, you know, I me an 
I™m talking about dozens and dozens of -- of -- 
of -- of -- of kids, 
you know, like through the 
grades, and -- and -- and so forth. And -- and realiz
ing that, you know, was just
 a terrible, terrible 
shock to me  of knowing that -- knowing that th
ey -- they -- there was 
no record of them, you 
know. You know, first -- first -- cause nobody said they
 -- that they would -- 
th-the -- the answer 
was there™s no record, you know, until such ti
me  as you really knew that obviously they 
perished. Because they were gathering record
s, so some ti me s you had hope well ma ybe -- ma ybe 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
98 
 
 
some  did still survive, you know, until you -- until the 
cold realization that th
ey did not. They did 
not. Because the regi stry was s
till active, you know, people would regi ster, and some times they 
were late and they were away some where and 
they would come  back and so forth. So after 
awhile, with the stark realit
y of all of that, became more and more apparent.  
Q: So liberation turns out not to be such liberation. 

A: Oh, of course not. 

Q: Right?  

A: Oh sure. Because when you were liberated, you per -- you personally felt that okay, I™m free. 

But what about the ot hers, where are they? Where are the relatives?  Where are -- where are the 

people that you knew, that you grew up with?  Your
 friends. And who s urv
ive, who did not?  I™m 
-- can you imagine living through th
at whole period of not knowi
ng, you know?  It™s like -- it™s 
like 9/11, you know. On a -- on a -- on a 
scale, on a -- right? Where you -- 
Q: So -- 
A: -- di -- didn™t know who 
-- who -- who was -- who escaped or who did not.  
Q: So what process did you go through?  Did you
 -- did you start mourning in a way, or there™s 
no body, there™s no funer -- th
ere™ no [indecipherable] 
A: There was nothing -- 
Q: There™s nothing. 

A: -- there was just an emptiness, you know, there 
was a total emptiness, to
tal -- total 
-- total yu -
- we knew there would be no bodies, obviousl
y, you know, there would 
be nothing to, you know. 
I don™t know whether my mother, whether she was 
buried at all, or not, or what, you know, I 
mean it was just that™s it, you know. I know she -- she -- she was killed and -- 

Q: That™s the end of it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
99 
 
 
A: -- and that was the end of
 it. You didn™t know any --  
Q: Right. 
A: -- there was no -- there was no bodi
es. So -- and of course the -- th
e -- the -- the also the -- the 
stark reality was also what now? Okay, we surviv
ed. Now what kind of a life  are we going to 
have now?  We knew we couldn™t es
tablish ourselves and we couldn™
t get jobs, there was no jobs. 
I mean, a lot of the Poles who were forced labor, Poles themselves, were just comi ng back to 

their own homes, trying to recover their ow
n things, you know?  I mean, you couldn™t -- there 
was no jobs available. And -- and in some  ways 
there is also a feeling 
of resentme nt if not 
outright hostility by some of the Polish people, 
who ma ny of them suffered too, of course not -- 
not like the Jews, who -- who were
 -- in some  wa ys there was some  jealousy too, because they -- 
the Jews were getting help. The Jews were get
ting American money from the Jewish agencies 
and so forth, you know, so -- so they weren™t 
hung -- they weren™t hungry
, I mean they were 
getting money, they could get some  food and they 
were helped and all that, you know?  So that in 
itself created frictions and tensi
ons which later resulted as you 
know in -- in outbreaks of -- of 
anti-Semitism and -- and -- and killings and so fort
h. So -- so it isn™ t like 
the Jews who survived 
felt welcome, or felt -- they didn™t feel any diffe
rent in some  ways than way before, you know, 
although there wasn™t any of that overt antise -- 
anti-Semitism, it certainly wasn™t a welcoming 
place. It wasn™t like comi ng back home. 

Q: Right. 

A: There was no home. 

Q: There was no home. 

A: There was no home. And there was no place to
 go really, you didn™t know what to do with 
yourself, until you began to think about emig
ration, you know, until you be gin ma ke contacts 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
100 
 
 
with the -- with -- with
 the -- you know, with the Canada, 
America, Australia, you know. You 
couldn™t go to Israel because until 1948 Israel 
was not a state. As we
 me ntioned before, you 
know, the -- the -- the -- the Br
itish had a embargo, you know, and they were constantly 
capturing these boats, you know, and -- and putting th
em to -- into internme
nt ca mps in Cyprus 
and others. Now who wanted to go back into 
a ghetto again, into a camp, you know?  And even 
though in the internme nt camp was obviously not a 
ghetto, there weren™t --
 but still, you know, 
you -- you -- your -- your freedom was gone again. So
 ma ny of the Jews, like in Poland, didn™t -- 
didn™t want to go, didn™t want to 
take that -- that risk. You di
dn™t feel like going there. You 
wanted to be free. You wanted to
 -- to -- to -- to -- to recaptu
re some  of that loss, you know. I 
never went to high school. I ne
ver experienced a high 
school life and the high school sports. My 
education stopped at the grade six or f-five a
nd a half. I had no education, no high school. I 
didn™t -- you know, it -- all I was is 
just ap -- an apprentice for a few years, so I didn™t have all 
that experience. So I had no skills, per se. I mea
n, I certainly wasn™t going to work in a leat her 
shop, and then what leather shop would -- would 
even take me ?  There was -- you know, I mean, 

there was a -- there was no need for my skills. 
So -- so there was like an emptiness, you know, 
really. And -- and at the same  
feeling of sort of a 
carefree thing, you know, from one day to the 
next, you know, you felt like. So as a result, 
people are roaming around. They were going -- 
going -- get on trains, traveling, going places
, you know, hoping to find some thing there, 
some thing here and -- and in fact George a
nd I ended up in Roma nia,
 you know, we thought we 
ma ybe going towards -- towards Palestine, trying
 to ma ybe get there. We still thought ma ybe 
there was a way of -- of doing it. And by the time
 we reached Roma nia we -- we -- we couldn™t 
go any farther, they -- they woul
dn™t let us go -- go through, we couldn™t get to Greece, so -- so 
after -- for a few months of 
traveling and [indecipherable] we
 finally end up going back to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
101 
 
 
Poland, cause at that time there was no -- we coul
dn™t -- there was no emi gration as yet, it wasn™t 
all set up yet, it was chaos. Ju
st think about trying to recons
truct these things, you know, trying 
to get people together. And so we ended up in 
the -- in the western part of Poland, which is 
originally Ge rman, you know when
 -- you know the deal that was ma de by Churchill, Roosevelt 
and Stalin. They gave eastern Pola
nd to Russia, to Soviet Russia 
and they took away part of the 
western Poland -- western Poland -- I mean eastern
 Germany, including Danzig to the Germans. 
So these were sort of the new territories, and 
we had hoped ma ybe could establish ourselves for 
awhile there. So we ended up in -- in Leignitz
, Legnica Leignitz which is one a -- which is a 
town in the -- in that part of
 Poland and try to -- to ma ybe ope
n a store or some thing, trying to 
ma ke a living there. So -- but that -- for awhile
, that didn™t last very
 long either. And in the 
meanti me  my father ended up in Munich, Germany, 1946, and Germany become  the ma jor, 

ma jor staging area for emigration. All the DP
 camps, displaced person camps were all 
established in a lot of Germany, Munich and ot
her places and so forth. And that™s where he 
eventually ended up. And I got ther
e in 1947. And end up and then I --
 it was another stage in my 
life there, you know, as a DP in Ger many for about three years. 
Q: We  need to stop the tape. 

A: Okay. 

Q: Okay. 
End of Tape Seven 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
102 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: Okay, Michael, you™ve now co
me  to Munich and it™s 1940 -- 
A: Seven. 
Q: -- seven. And you™re 19 years old. 

A: Right. Okay, I came to Munich and my father
 was already there with Genya and Helen. And 

my brother ma rried since then. 

Q: That was fast. 

A: He found -- yeah, he found his spouse and still 
while they were in Poland, and he actually con 
-- made contact with her in Romania. And her name
 was Frieda, they™r e still married to this very 
day. And so he was there, too, and then I arrive
d, and I took a little room 
in [indecipherable] of 
the apartments outside the DP ca mp . And my firs
t interest wa s in trying to get some  education. 
And I want to learn English, I want to learn Fren
ch. So I had a pridis -- some  private lessons, but 
of course I want to get a job, too. So I joined 
the international refugee 
organization, IRO, and I 
was assigned to the desk where they handled 
hardship cases. Now hardship cases were -- 

primarily meant expectant mothers, you know, disp
laced person expectant mother, because they 
were to be expedited sooner so that they would 
get to the -- wherever they were going, and have 
their babies there, instead of ha
ving them in the DP ca mp itself, where conditions we ren™t really 
that good. I mean, they were -- they were fine, 
you know, but they were camps, basically refugee 
camps. So I handled those cases too, tho -- ma inly 
those cases and worked there and -- and then I 
became an allied civi lian as a result of that, 
which gave me  PX privileges. Now you know PX 

privileges, at that time, for a -- for a boy lik
e me, you know, from the -- from the ghetto, was a 
big thing, because I was able to go to thePX and buy all the American, you know, goodies, you 

know, the candies, and the 
-- and the cigarettes at that time,
 of course, too, you know, and -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
103 
 
 
so forth. But at any rate, that was interesting 
work. And -- and of course
 the idea was to -- to 
emigrate, you know, obviously the -- living in Ge
rmany post-war was -- was -- it was not -- you 
know, you -- you didn™t feel comfortable. They -- ther
e was still a time  when a lot of the German 
prisoners of war were comi ng home , you know, they
 were recovering from the war. They were 
released, of course, much sooner than ™47, but th
ey were still recoveri
ng and -- and there was a 
lot of shortages of food, you know
, there were rations. And Muni
ch was badly dama ged in the 
war too, so there was a lot of poverty around and -- a
nd -- and of course, I spoke German well, so 
I had no trouble communicating. We r -- you know, liv
ing quarters were very
 crowded, they were 
crowded in with other German fa mi lies. You ha
d a room, and there were other German fa milies 
in the other rooms, you know, in the same  apartm
ent, etcetera. But I enjoyed the work very 
much, you know. It gave me  contact with the En
glish speaking people because the people in 
charge were Americans from the United States, fr
om the agencies, from the IRO, from -- from 
HIAS and AJDC, which is the -- 
the a -- American Jewish -- 
Q: Is it -- 
A: -- commi ttee -- 

Q: -- Jewish Joint -- 

A: -- Joint co mmittee. 

Q: So the IRO was an offshoot -- 

A: We ll, the IRO was sort of a -- I think it wa
s a s -- was established 
-- I wonder whether that 
was a United Nations agency possi
bly, but I think there was under al
so as a s -- as in under the 
auspices or under some  connection with the 
-- with the AJDC and -- and HIAS, but which 
handles the Jewish part. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
104 
 
 
A: Because the DPs were full of non-Jews as well. Those DP camps were not only Jews, they 
were all kinds, there were Poles and -- and all ki
nds of nationalities, all 
-- all people that were 
displaced, you know, people that were displaced persons who -- who were in German work 

camps or some thing and they didn™t go back, you 
know, they wanted to emigrate. So -- so the 
IRO was mo re of a -- of an overa
ll umbrella, as it were. And HIAS and the AJDC wer e  kind of 
affiliated, or sister  agenci es that were working 
with the -- with the Jewish people, so I was -- 

Q: Did you ge -- sorry. 

A: Sorry. 

Q: Did you get a salary? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: They paid you? 

A: Oh yes, I got -- well, that™s how 
I got my money for the -- yeah -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- that was -- that was -- that was like my 
first pa ying job, you know, because I di dn™t get 
much money when I was an apprentice. 
Q: Right. 

A: Maybe some  pocket money and f
ood, that™s about all. See, I -- I 
had to get a salary, not very 
much, but I get a -- got enough, so I lived fairly 
comfortably then, and -- and then it -- where I 
began to re -- slowly began to feel maybe I™m 
getting back into a norma l mode of life. And then 
my father was sponsored by some one in Canada
 -- you see, you ha -- 
you still had to have 
sponsorship, which is kind of really tough because -- because on one hand here you™re s -- you™re 

a survivor and then you have to wait for a year -- 
or for two or three years, which is terrible, I 
mean that™s some thing that I -- was very hard 
for me  to understand as to why -- why these -- you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
105 
 
 
know, the Canadian, American [inde
cipherable] people at that time 
were so reluctant to bring 
these people in, even though you were caref
ully checked me dically, you know, if you had 
tuberculosis they wouldn™t let you out, you had 
to be treated, and blood tests and all kinds of 
things because they didn™t want 
to obviously bring in sick people into -- into the country, into 
Canada or the United States. But you had that wai
ting period and these people in the -- in DP 
camps, while -- while it was a far cry from being in
 a ghetto, still I mean, they were -- they had 
food and they had some  clothing, but that™s about
 -- you know, they didn™t
 have -- there was no 
work, you know, per se. And there was just like waiting, 
waiting to -- to -- to -- to emigrate, and 
ma ny of them I guess had to be absorbed, and then -- and then maybe in European countries and 
so forth. So this was -- it was going on for a number
 of years. Because when I left -- left in 1950, 
when I emigrated Canada , the DP camps were still ac 
-- st ill --  still in existence. So that™s anot her 
aberration if you will, of -- of histor y and some  sens
e that -- that these people were st ill sort of 
second class citizens, even though they were -- ma
ny of them were Jewish
 survivors and ma ny of 
them were -- were others, you know, other nationalities. So my f -- I™m sorry. 

Q: I was going to ask you, did you know some on
e name d Amy Gottlieb, who worked for the 
JDC in Munich? 

A: Not -- I -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- didn™t ring -- doesn™t 
-- not -- not in that camp, there were several camps -- 
Q: What camp were you in, actually? 

A: It was in the Munich camp, I™ m trying to reme
mber the name  of it, there was a large camp 
right -- right outside -- ri
ght -- right -- right outsi
de of Munich, one of the -- one of the big ones, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
106 
 
 
and I may have the name of it in my  files somewher
e, but I don™t --  I don™t have it -- maybe I still 
have it with me , I can look it up. 
Q: So it took you three years to get out of -- 

A: Yeah, so my father got -- got out, I think, in
 1949, when he got out first and then I followed 
him. He kind of -- he was sponsored by -- by -- by
 people at -- that he ma de contact with in 

Vancouver, British Columbia, and then he sponsored me , and then I followed him, a nd then I 

ended up in 1950, in Vancouver, British Columbia, in Canada.  

Q: Did you feel really liberated then? 

A: I felt -- yeah, well, it was an
 adventure, was a new country, I 
-- finally I found ma ybe this was 
a new -- new beginnings and new world for me , yes 
indeed, yeah, right. That was a -- a time  
when I -- and of course I was aware that I was olde
r than most kids of my age who were -- went 
to high school and so forth, because I was alre
ady like 22 -- close to be
ing 22, I think it was, 
early in 1950 and I was born in August. But you 
know, 22 years old was kind of old even for -- 
for a freshman in college, and I had this desire 
to go to college, and my father wasn™t really 
totally encouraging cause he felt 
that I should ma ybe get a trade,
 you know. His idea at that time  
was I should learn how to repair typewriters. That 
would have been a big help to me , right, later 
on, you know, to repair typewriters, you know. Yea
h, right? He thought that
 was a great thing, 
you know, from his vantage point, you know, typewriters was a -- was a mechanically advanced, 

you know, equipment, you know, and so forth. Repairing typewriters would give me  a ma  -- give 

me  a pretty good living, you know, so -- and of course
, I -- I didn™t think that
 was attra -- exactly 
what I wanted to do. So what I did wa s -- is I 
went to a college entran
ce preparatory school in 
Vancouver, by the name  of Surepass, which was a funny na me of the -- 

Q: Showpass? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
107 
 
 
A: Because you were -- you were sure to pass, you 
know, right, so it™s called Surepass, that was 
the name  of it. 
Q: Surepass? 

A: Surepass. And I took for one -- one year, 
you know, I took this ma tr
iculate -- I took the 
examination and I was able to get my college entrance examination at  the University of British 

Columbia. 

Q: Wo w. 

A: And -- and this was with -- w
ith -- only with a five and a half
 or five grade hi -- school, you 
know. But I studied hard, you know, and I took some
 courses and -- in that school and they -- 
they kind of knew what to learn, what to study 
and ma ybe they had a history of re -- you know, 
they knew -- didn™t know exactly what exam woul
d contain, but they had a backlog of -- of the 
kind of exams that they would give, and so th
ey steered the courses 
towards -- but you know, I 
got a fairly good -- good background, and I enter 
-- and I entered the University of British 
Columbia, and went to college then, and so -- and 
my father was at that time -- of course tuition 
was only like ma ybe 300 dollars a -- a seme ster 
or  something like that, so it wasn™t  a terribl e 
burden to my father because my father when he
 got the -- came  to Cana
da he had some  money 
with him, and then he got in the construction 
business and he built a -- a rental pr operty, so he 

was okay, he was always the entrepreneur, you know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: This was -- this was his great, great fo
rte is to -- is to 
ma ke a living, you know 
[indecipherable] to -- to be able to
 -- to do that. It was, I guess, in 
his genes. And so I went to the 
University of British Columbia, and then I 
took su mmer jobs, you know, like working for the 
Hudson™s Bay, you know, as a clerk and doing all kinds
 of things. And then
 I -- after a year I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
108 
 
 
lived on campus of the University of British Colu
mbia. And -- and then I took a year out before 
t hi s  -- before t he fi nal  year, before the -- t he -- 
the -- the seni or year  and worked full time just to 
ma ke some  money, and this is during that tim
e I me t Ethel. You know, and I lived by myself. 
Relationship with -- with Genya was very bad. 
And my father had big problems  there, too. 
George was in his own business, he was in the -- 
he was always me chanically inclined, so he got 
into -- into the dry clean
ing supplies business in -- 
Q: In Canada, also? 
A: -- in kota -- in Canada and Vancouver also. A
nd I was very fortunate that I graduated ahead of 
the class of 1955, head of the graduating class and 
the faculty of arts. And 
I got the -- the -- the 
Governor general™s me dal for -- for the -- for numb
er one, and so that wa s -- that was a -- and on 
the strength of that I got a fellowship for -- for 
Yale, you know. So I kind 
of made up for a little 
bit of lost time. 

Q: So you got a Master™s from Yale? 
A: I got Master™s from Yale, yeah. 
Q: In languages? 

A: In -- no, in foreign area studies. 

Q: In foreign area studies, uh-huh. 

A: Yeah, international. I had at 
one time  maybe -- I had an idea 
of perhaps going into the foreign 
service, but then I was ha ndicapped because in or
der to go into the foreign service, the United 
States had the law that you had to be a citizen
 for 10 years before you could join the foreign 
service. So 10 years, and I -- I 
didn™t ob -- obviously not, and I didn™
t -- I -- I was not, I was just  
a -- just a -- I was only a -- a ra 
-- you know, a -- a resident with a -- for one year when I got my 
Master™s degree, so I -- 
I didn™t want to wait that long. So 
I thought that ma ybe I would go to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
109 
 
 
then I got another fellowship for Columbia to conti
nue for a PhD., perhaps in -- in -- in that area. 
And I got restless, I -- some how academia did not at
tract me a-any more, I felt I need to get with 
the mainstream, I wanted to -- to ma ybe establish my
 -- I -- I had great, great desire to mi x, to be 
in a ma instream, because of this isolation of all 
the years, you know, I -- I wanted -- I didn™t want  
to be isol ated in the -- in th
e fee -- in the academi a. And the close I got to the academia, I got 
very restless with the faculty life and the -- so
me of the backbiting that
 I came  across, you know, 
in this, you know, so -- so 
-- so in a kind of an hist
orical interesting thing 
too, is that when I got 
my fe llowship for Columbia University, the dire
ctor of the Russian Institute was no one bu-but 
Zbigniew Brzezinski . And it™s interesting spec
ulate what would have happened if I had 
continued. And he was Polish, as you know.  
Q: Right. 

A: Whether I would have been his right hand, or
 -- or ma ybe I would have continued with him 
and -- and ended up in the high echelons of -- of
 -- of governme nt and you know, and that -- and 
so forth, you know, and the -- but I didn™t take that 
route and I decided to go
 into the -- into the 
business world. And interesting, my father neve
r thought I would be a good businessman. Yeah, 

he always thought that I had tw
o left hands, which is [indeciph
erable] his expression. I -- I was 
too -- I was too soft, I was too sensitive, you 
know, I wasn™t tough enough. I wasn™t cut out for 
the business world. We ll, I proved him wrong, b
ecause I was very, very successful in the 
business world. And I did climb the corporate la
 -- you know, a corporate scale and I got some  
very important corporate jobs and -- and was pres
ident of companies and sit on board of directors 
and all that kind of stuff, until I retired and I got
 into my own -- my own business, but -- so I did 
prove him wrong, you know, so -- because when I -- when
 I joined the -- when 
I went into -- into 
the retail business, I went on the executive traini
ng of Macy™s in New York, he thought that I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
110 
 
 
wasted all that time  going to college. You know, 
was a total waste, even though I told him that 
without a college education they wouldn™t accep
t you into -- into executive training. But he 
couldn™t -- he couldn™t -- he thought I was -- I was 
just -- just talking nonsense, he said he 
couldn™t -- he couldn™t understand. He  said, you don™t 
need a college education to be -- to go to 
work in a store, you know. He thought I was, 
you know, the clerk or something, I me an who 
wants to -- who needs a college education to --
 to stand behind the counter and -- you know, and 
-- and sell and sell the haberdashery or whatev
er, you know, or housewares. So at any rate, so 
that was -- that was basically what has happe
ned and -- and of course having been fortunate 
enough to meet Ethel and to put up 
with me and with all my bagga
ge that I carried with me , it 
wasn™t -- wasn™t easy and -- and it was this
 cultural gap, too, you know
, when you -- and I -- I 
was very self conscious about my ba ckground. I 
was self conscious about -- about my accent, 
about not speaking English well, you know, I had such 
a terrible, terrible desi
re to fit in, to be 
one of the -- of the ma ss es. I didn
™t want to be a -- a -- a outsid
er. I didn™t want to be asked, hey, 
you speak, you know, where you from, you know. You 
have an accent, you know. That used to 

bother -- bother me  a lot, you know. Maybeit was me , you know, ma ybe it was -- you know, 

was ma ybe foolish on my part of -- to feel that wa y, but in Va ncouver, which is more of a 

provincial town, you know, people wouldn™t hesitate to ask you. In New York you can speak all 

kinds of language, nobody pays attention to 
you. But in Vancouver, you know, you open your 

mouth and -- and not that they were that terribly
 interested in you, all th
ey want to hear where 
you from, you know. They didn™t know -- they di
dn™t want to say wow, gee, you know, where 
you from and how -- when did you come  or anything 
like that. All they wanted to know is where, 
you know, just to satisfy their s
uperficial curiosity as it were, 
you know. So -- so that bothered 
me  quite a bit, and -- and of course my accent wa
s much, muc h heavier, you know. In fact, Ethel 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
111 
 
 
kids me about the fact when we first started to
 date, you know, I -- I sti
ll didn™t know how to say 
t-h properly, and I -- I would say wiz instead of
 with, you know. And that 
sort of thing, so -- 
Q: You seem to be doing okay. 
A: Oh, I™m doing fi -- I think I™m doing be
tter, you know. I seem to be doing better. 
Q: And with Ethel you™ve had two daughters? 

A: Two daughters. 

Q: And now you have three gran -- 

A: Three grandsons. 

Q: -- thre-three grandsons. 

A: Yes. Very much [indecipherable] 

Q: Let me  just ask you one question. 

A: Yes. 

Q: This is the first time you™ve
 agreed to be interviewed. 
A: The very first time. 

Q: Why now? 

A: Well, actually, I was lucky because I -- all 
I di d was return -- I had the for m from the 
museum, which sat on my desk for about two or 
three years. And there was a name  which I don™t 
think that lady is -- is any longe
r with -- with your departme nt, but if you gave me  the name  I 
may recall that. 

Q: Amy Reuben? 

A: No. There was some body else. 

Q: Arwin? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
112 
 
 
A: Mm- mm. We ll, ma ybe it was more than even tw
o or three years ago. At  any rate, it sat on my 
desk and I had ma ybe -- whatever it was, I had a 
survivor™s block, I didn™t register because that 
was a kind of a form very similar to the -- to -- well, it was the original form that I sent  in, that 
was the -- the very same  for m that I sent in. 
And I finally filled it out and I put down, you know, 
and all that, with the Mi eczyslaw We reszczyszyn 
business and all that, and I got a call. I didn™t 
expect to get a call. I didn™t expect to -- to be 
a --  to ask for the interv
iew. I didn™t know whether 
I would qualify, whether my background was dr
amatic enough to -- you know, to qualify for 
that. So lo and behold, I get this 
call from Elizabeth, would I be w
illing to do that, and I said of 
course I would. And that happened to
 be coincidental with -- with st
ar -- I started to write, I have 
like a chapter of my me moirs, I started to do th
at. So there wa s [indecipherable] for two this 
really, that I did. Why di dn™t I do it sooner?  Again, 
I -- I just -- I didn™t -- maybe I -- because I 
didn™t feel that my story was -- was that impor
tant, you know, in the scheme  of things. Maybe I 
didn™t want to go through this whole -- the 
past, you know, trying to 
relive all that and go 
through this -- through these very painful, 
terrible me mories, you 
know. You know, ma ybe I 
didn™t want  to do this so I don™t lose faith in
 humanity, you know. Because I™ve always been an 
optimist and I still am. I believe that  humankind can
 be better. I strongly believe in that, and I 
strongly believe that -- th
at life is sacred, that human life 
is sacred, whether it™s one or one 
million or six million or  whatever, you know. Every 
human life is sacred in my -- and I deeply 
believe in that, that™s my -- that™s my religion, 
as it were. I am a me mber of the Ethical Culture 
Society. And this is my religion, ethical humanist. 
So I have a very strong feeling about that. So 
ma ybe I didn™t want to do that be
cause I didn™t wa nt to -- to ni
bble at that -- at that st-strong 
feeling. I didn™t want to lose, maybe -- maybe co
me  bitter again, you know, a-about that, or lose 
-- lose faith in humanity, become  distrustful,
 you know. And s o I™m very happy, I™m very happy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
113 
 
 
now. I™m ha ppy to be alive. And I™m very happy to 
be able to tell you my
 story. And I sure hope 
that it --  it™ll be of interest to
 -- to other viewers and I™m ready 
and willing and able at any time to 
-- if they have any furthe r questions or anythi ng 
more t-to -- to talk a
bout, because there™s so 
much -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- that  --  I said a lot and 
there™s maybe more to be said. 

Q: I™m sure there is. 

A: So -- 

Q: We ll, I want to thank you for being so open. 

A: I want to thank you very much. You have no 
idea -- you™ll never know what you did here is -- 
is just -- I™m most, most grateful
 and appreciative of that. And -- 
and I want to, from the depth of 
my heart, I really thank you so much. 

Q: Thank you from my heart too. 
A: Thank you. 
Q: Okay.

Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: And wha t  is this photo here?  Now you can explain. 
A: Okay, well this is a picture of my mother wh
en I was about eight years old, would have been 
the year of 1936.  

Q: And she would have been how old do you think? 

A: About 31. 

Q: And -- and her name? 

A: Her name was -- was Leah, the -- we used to
 call her Liecha in Yiddish, what today would 
have been known as Lisa. 

Q: Lisa Sarah? 

A: Lisa Sarah wert -- Li sa Sarah Wertman. Ma
iden name  Truk. These are pictures of my 
mother™s parents. Their name  was Truk, and Sara
h was the -- was the mother and Zander was the 
father. And this was taken about the same  ti
me , about 1936, where they lived in Danzig. And 
they both perished in the Holocaust. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Okay, this is one of the earlie
st pictures I have of myself, I 
was about four years old, taken on 
a horse, which was kind of a staged
 picture at the time, and -- cour
se it was taken in L™vov. This 
is a street scene in L™vov when my grandmothe
r was visiting and it™s a picture of her and my 
mother and myself, and I ma y have been about wh
at, five years old at the time. As you can see 
fr om it, that -- we were --  it was cold weathe
r and I™m kind of well covered for the -- for the 
elements here. Okay, this was taken in a town 
called Sopwot, which was near Danzig. It was a 
resort town and a beach, and I was four or five y
ears old at the time, one -- on one of my visits to 
Danzig. And on the picture, starting 
from the right is my mother, next to her is my grandmother. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
115 
 
 
Next to her, standing, is the sister
 of -- my aunt, sister of my 
mother. And sitting right behind me  
is Abrun Truk, who is one of -- one
 of the brothers of 
my mo ther. And I have very -- very, very 
pleasant me mories because that was still a time of
 peace and it was a beautiful resort area. And I 
had a lot of -- lot of fun at the time, on the b
each, playing in the sand. Okay, this was taken a bit 
later, I was at that time, possibly 10 year old, 
10 or 11, shortly before the wa r, and again it™s -- 
it™s -- br ings back me mo ries, of course, of my ch
ildhood. Kind of a little bit studied picture, but -
- but it -- it ref -- it shows -- shows pr etty accurately my -- my Aryan look. Now this is a very 
interesting pi ctur e because it shows my mother 
and her brothe r Ben, who was very dear to us, 
just before he left Danzig, in 1939, he was able 
to escape from Danzig and my mother was still 
in Danzig at that time. So she was the only one 
of her sisters and brothe
rs who was -- who stayed 
behind, while the others were able
 to leave Danzig and survive ab
road. Okay, now this is a shot 
of -- of my t ypical work day when I was worki
ng as an apprentice, and when I was the Aryan 
Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn, and my  work was at 
the sewing machines, sometimes it was away 
from the machine doing other things. But I did 
a lot of sewing and as you can see, there are 
patterns hanging behind, and pieces of
 leather. So that was a typica
l -- typical work day shot for 
me . Okay, the other picture, the small picture sh
ows me  with a typical apron that we all wore 
because we did a lot of cutting leat her and dirty work
 as well. Just in the -- 
in the cour tyard of the 
-- of the workshop that I worked in. 

Q: The one on your left. 

A: Okay, this is a street scene, one of the la
dies I befriended. I didn™t 
know her for very long, but 
we happened to be walking down the street and th
ere was a shot taken. And this is typical, with 

the hat, that I looked at, and -- a
nd again it shows -- it shows me  in
 -- in -- in Wa rsaw. This shot 
was taken when I was visiting the family, the Bo
zym fa mily in the -- in the suburb of Warsaw 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
116 
 
 
and the woma n in -- that is with me a -- the young la
dy is one of the sisters 
of the family that I -- 
that I was friendly with. It
 just shows my blonde hair and my ove
rall looks at the time. Okay, this 
was Mr. Bozym, who was the father of the -- of th
e fa mily and he was a carpenter and he is the 
one that I worked with at that Germa n infantry 
unit in the --  the artillery unit where I was injured 
working with him at the time. And he was a very
 gentle soul, and a ver
y, very friendly chap. 
Okay, now this is actually a post-war picture,
 that was 1947, taken in Munich when I was 19 
years old, but it pr etty much illust rates what I l
ooked like and how I was able
 to -- to pass as an 
Aryan with my wavy blonde hair, blue eyes, and at
 that time  not -- not very prominent Jewish 
nose. Wa s i n [indecipherable] already, I™m not su
re when he moved. Wa it now, this is a very, 
very early picture of my father, it™s very inte
resting because he was onl
y 25 years old at the time 
and the woma n beside him is the mother -- his 
fi rst wife, the mother of
 George and Mordechai, 
and was taken 1920, and it shows my father with a b
eard and a typical hat worn at that time, so 
remi niscent of -- of ﬁFiddler on 
the Roof.ﬂ And he -- I 
don™t ever -- I don™t reme mber  ever him 
having -- with a beard, so it must have been way back when, and then when -- he decided to 

shave his beard when he moved to L™vov. This is
 a photo of my brother 
George and his wife 
Frieda, taken in Munich in 1947. He was, by then, 
pretty mu ch recovered fr
om his ordeal on the -
- in the -- in the camp of
 Wi nniki, and trying to estab -- get 
hims elf established and of course 
waiting for emigration.  

Q: And George is the son of your father -- 

A: Right, and George is the son of my -- my fa
ther™s first wife. Yeah, my -- my half-brother, 
seven years older. This is a shot of my -- my
 father and I, taken 1948 
in Munich, Germany. And 
again it shows my appearance, and my father di
dn™t really look that stern, but he always had a 

very serious expressi on on his face. And at that
 time he had that mu -- moustache, which he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
117 
 
 
would later shave, but he had that moustache 
for ma ny, ma ny years. We  some ti me s kidded him 
about it, sayi ng why do you w -- why do you wear a -- why do you have a Hitler moustache, but 
it was the fashion of the time. [i
ndecipherable] after the war, but 
-- okay, now this -- this piece of 
paper is very interesting and important histor ica
lly because it d -- it authenticates my name  of 
Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn. It was taken right after 
the war, where I had to regi ster with the 
local authorities. My other documents were -- we
re lost and destroyed, bu
t this survived. And it 
actually shows that I registered under that name
 and I also paid a fee for the registration.  
Q: You were t -- 

A: Okay, this is a -- I never, of course, had my
 or iginal birth certificates, all those documents 
were lost, you know, in the Holocaust and in 1993, when I applied for Medicare, I wa s 

encouraged to try to obtain a birt
h certificate because the Medicare authorities felt that it™s a 
good -- good thing to have for the record. So I 
wrote to the authorities in Warsaw, Polish 
authorities, giving my name as Wertman, Abraham, 
because that was my original birth certificate 
name, and ga -- giving them th -- my -- my addre
ss in L™vov and the place and the st reet where I 

was born, without giving them the name  of my
 parents and sure enough, they were able to 
actually dig up all the records and 
this is in Polish, saying that th
is a -- a copy -- an abbreviated 
copy of my birthcertificat
e, listing of course my name  as 
We rtma n, Abraham, showing the date 
of August 30, 1928. City of birth, L™ vov, and the na
me  of my father, Chuna We rtma n, which is 
correct, and of course -- and my
 mother™s Sarah Leah Truk, which was her ma iden name . So I 
was glad to actually have a -- an 
-- a real, authentic birth certificat
e. Ba -- four -- thr --three -- 
three -- four years ago, 
three years ago -- wait! 
Q: Oops, my mi stake, go ahead. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0464  
118 
 
 
A: About three years ago, my brother George and Fr
ieda, shown here decided t -- to take a trip to 
Poland and to -- just as part of their itinerary. 
And they went to the street with -- where I was 
born, where we all lived, and the two photos show 
the outside, which is a 
street that™s numbers 
still there, 6A, and the street name, Pilnikarska, 
which is not shown here. And of course it™s -- 
it™s in disr epair, but that ™s sort
 of the gate where we -- where 
we -- the entrance to it, and the 
upper windows is where we lived, and the lower pa
rt, which is on the -- on the right hand side 
here, were some  other apartments that my father
 would rent out, and it shows the interior -- 
interior court, and on the right ha
nd side was a stable where my father kept some  horses for his -- 
with a wagon and where he would get milk from
 the -- from the railroad station for his 
processing of milk and for the milk products, and 
so forth. On the left was the -- part of the 
factory and the store, and it looks boarded up 
now, so it™s really in -- in bad repair, but 
interestingly it™s still 
-- it™s still ther e.
