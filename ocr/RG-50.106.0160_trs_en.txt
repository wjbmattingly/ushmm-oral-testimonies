A: I™m of Romanian ancestry and conseque
ntly both my parent
s had emigrated from 
Romania
 and as a result spoke Romanian in th -- in the house and wh en I went to 
school, the elementary school, I used to 
answer the teacher so
meti me s in  Ro manian  
when I didn™t know how to sp
eak it in English. But nevert
heless, mostly Romanian as 
a youngster, and then -- excuse me -- as I 
grew up it just comp
letely changed to 
English and didn™t use it again. 
Q: Can you tell me please 
about your hometown from your 
childhood? Wh at kinds of 
childhood memo ries do you ha
ve of your hometown? 
A: Well, 
Youngsto wn 
at that time was a very thriving me-metropolis because it was 
on the theater circuit. My father was a very
 avid theater-goer, so I recall going to the 
Hippodrome 
and th e
 Pala ce
 theaters and seeing the 
old magician shows with 
Thurston 
and 
Blackstone
 and those, and seeing 
Al Jolson u-
up on the stage in 
person while in my father™s lap, a
nd then later on as his a-accompanying 

[indecipherable]
. 
Q: What else do you reme
mber a b out you
r hometown? 
A: Well, I -- I -- of course I remember goi ng to high school, pe
rhaps more so t h an 

anything else. I was a pretty good student 
actually, I was val-valedictorian of my  
class. And it was during the early wartime,
 in  -- in 1943 when I graduated, and -- 
Q: I-I™m going to not get the war years just yet. 
A: Okay .

Q: Were there many Jews in your 
town  wh en you were growing up? 
A: Certainly in the area that I grew up 
in because it was a -- what we call a mix ed 
area. There were Jews, there were French, 
there were Italians, and -- in fact, it w as 
almo st a -- a conglomeration of just ever
y -- every language there was spoken. And 
as a result, actually when I was younger, I s
poke some of the other languages, too. I 
learned how to speak a little 
Hungarian and a little bit of Italian, which makes it 
easier because Romanian and Italian are 
pretty mu ch aligned. And under those 
circumstan ces even as a youngster, we went
 to each other™s homes and so  forth and 
heard it spoken because 
that™s what most people spoke at
 that time. And, oh, we were 
at that time, foreigners. My father had ra 
-- come here, as I said
, working in the steel 
mills and when the war broke 
out and -- first World War, he
 volunteered to go and he 
was in the American expeditionary fo rce, and when the war was over he 
automatically became a citiz
en. A nd he was still a young man, he was only in his 
20™s and decided to go back to 
Romania
 and find somebody to marry. And he met 
my  mo ther and they  had a -- a courtship that lasted a short period of time, and he got 

married there in 
Romania
 and came here, and brought her with him. And s -- at the 
time that she came to this co
untry, she was pregnant and I was born -- she got here in 
February and I was born in March, in 1925
. I can always say I was conceived there 
and dedicated here.

Q: You said you came from a community
 with a lot of different people 
[indecipherable]
 different -- 
A: Ethnic groups, yeah. 
Q: -- ethnic groups. How did they all ge
t along, and how -- specifically how did 
people get along? 
A: Oh. 

Q: How did the Jewish community get 
along with the Christian community? 
A: We had a ver -- marvelously -- that™s -- 
we had friends that were Romanian Jews 
that spoke Romanian and actu
ally they didn™t ca
ll themselves Jewish. I don™t think 
there was any distinction back
 in  those days a-about being a Hebrew or a Jew or 
whatever it was. And you were Greek or you  were Italian, that™s fine. And we all 
played together and we all 
comm iserated with each other when  thin gs went wrong, 

and it was -- the relatio nship wa
s exceptional, I think.  
Q: You told me about your father™s liveli
hood, but you didn™t tell me his name. What 
was his name?  
A: His -- his name was 
John
 also. So I™m really, to all 
intents and purposes, junior, 
but he never used his middle name, so I -- 
but I have, so I -- that distinguishes me 
from him, cause I™m a 
Charles. 
Q: And what was your mo ther™s name?

Morjinia na
, wh ich just me ans marginal in nature, comi ng from the mountain area, 
and her father™s and -- a
nd her -- her parents were 
from the mountains, the 
munchan,
 
in
 Transylvania,
 that part of 
Romania
 that is western part of the 
Carp athian
 
mountains. 
Q: What wo rk did your mo ther do? 

A: My mo th er had finished school and -- at
 mo -- moment that my
 father brought her 
here. She went to school here to speak Eng
lish, and she was a sea m stress for a period 
of time and during the war work ing in a -- 
a -- as a supervisor in a factory making 
uniforms and raincoats and 
so forth for the military. 
Q: Do you have
 any siblings? 
A: No, I™m an only child. 

Q: You mentioned high school, do you re
me mb er anything about elementary school, 
and do you know the name of
 your elementary school? 
A: Oh, I have some nice, fond thoughts of my  elementary school because in the 

fourth  grade I had the teacher named
 McLaughlin
 who was very fond of me and I 
was a good student and she challenged me in 
more ways than one, 
in the work that I 
was doing because I got special
 work over and above what
 she taught the general 
class, because it was such a mixed group. A
nd it was at that time that my mother and 

I went to visit 
Europe
 and this teacher encouraged it,
 even though I was going to be

absent for a period of time, and encourag ed 
it very strongly and wa -- I wrote to her 
and we communicated during the time I wa
s gone. As a result though, I was gone 
about a year and a half and went to school there, i-in 
Romania
, so going back to the -
- my  parent™s homes. And -- but decided at th
at time -- the decision, that is, was left 

to me by my parents as to whether I wanted 
to stay there or whether I wanted to come 
back here and I chose to come back 
here, wanting to be back in -- in 
America
, and 
from then on it was just here.  
Q: When you were a child, what were your 
plans for your fu ture, or your ambitions? 
A: As -- as a child my own ambitions were
 always -- they were led by my parents 
because the thing that
 they wanted most of all wa
s for me to go to school. And 
whatever it was that I did, it didn™t make a
ny big difference. I always leaned toward 
being a doctor, and my father said, if that
™s w h at you want to be, that™s fine, go 
ahead, let™s -- but you™ve got to excel in 
school and -- and this was the time. And of 
course the depression held th
ings back consid erably duri
ng that time. And we always 
fared very well, though, because my fath
er had a good -- good job and work ed se-
several days a week and so that we alwa
ys didn™t have to wo
rry about whether we 
had en ough food on the table or anything.  

Q: What did you do for f
un wh en you were a kid? 
A: Well, abs -- I was p retty athletic so I wa -- we played baseball and football. I 
played a little baseball. We ha
d baseball group that collect
ed in the ne
ighborhood and

we played  other neig hborhoods, so we had 
-- th-that was a real big, going th ing. And 
football, I tried football in high school for 
a short period of time, but I was wiser than 
mo st kids and I quit it. They  didn™
t pay very mu ch in those days. 
Q: Did you come from a relig
iously observant family? 
A: Yes. Yes. My father came from a mini
ster™s family. Actua
lly, a second family. 
His father was married and had five childre
n and th-the diphtheria epidemic hit them 
and all of them died, including his wife, 
and he was left single and still a young man 
and a minister. And he remarried and th en
 he had the five other children and my 

father was the youngest of those five. A-
Actually a favorite of my -- of my 
grandfather. But they -- he was a minister
 th ere and my father kept all the -- th e 
[indecipherable] 
and all holidays and -- and -- and I 
-- I grew up that way cause we 
were Orthodox
 
and un -- under those circumstances,
 we went to church. When he 
came here as a young man, he built the chur
ch that was the Ort
hodox church. They 
dug it with their own hands an
d shovels and so forth to  put the foundations in and so  
on, it was just something. Th
e church still stands, too. 
Q: The name of the church ? 

A: It™s 
Saint Mary™s
 in 
Youngstown
. And then 
Holy  Cross
 is what it™s called now 
cause they moved in to a big se
ction of town now, near the 
Butler™s
 Art Museum and 
the -- and the 
Yo ung sto wn
 colleges in a very, very sp ecial section in 
Wick
 Avenue
. 
 
Q: Did you have any favorite traditions
 or holidays when 
you were a child?

A: Yes, Easter is our biggest tradition and 
most favorite. Not only my parents, but I 
guess it™s because I was a youngster it always is, and it was always a -- one of our 

biggest holid ays. 
Q: Why? 
A: Oh, I guess it was because of the -- the -- 
the birth of Christ 
and all and the story 
that goes along with  it and -- and how it 
all happened and wh at it meant to begin 
with.  
Q: Did you ever witness any anti-Sem
itism in your childhood before the war? 
A: There -- there was no su ch thing in no 
-- not in our neighbor
hood, no. This was a 
mixed neighborhood as I me
ntioned before. None. No . 
Q: What do you rememb er hearing ab out
 Hitler
 before the war started? Did you hear 
anything at all? 

A: Yes, from my father particularly beca
use he was in World War I and the stories 
that he told about that war were easily tr
anslated into what wa
s going on there now. 
And he was quite happy that I had decided 
not to stay there because that™s when 
Hitler
 was rising in his power and he said, this
 man is ev il. And some of the things 
that he was perpetrating against his own -- ow
n people there, even th ough he wasn™t a 
real German, were pretty atrocious.

Q: It sounds like your father was qu
ite aware of what was happening in 
Germany
, 
but we-were you also aware of things like, let™s say the 
Berlin
 Olympics, do you 
remember that? 
A: Yes, I do. And 
Kristallnacht
, yes, yes, yeah. The reas
on for that is because my 
father was a very avid follo
wer of what was going on a nd s -- and not only by paper 
but radio had just come in during this partic
ular time and we had a good radio that we 
kept up with wh at was going on, and as a 
result it rubbed off on me because when  we 
talked about it and -- even at church or a
nyplace else, and the me
n spoke, the children 
were there and we listened 
and we heard an-and participated actually, in -- in many 
of the discussions that were had. 
Q: Do you reme mb er any 
of the things that were said in church about 
Hitler
 and 
what was going on in 
Germany
? 
A: Oh yes, that -- that he was an evil 
man that had deposed the -- mo st of the 
hierarchy that was there in 
Germany
 and was taking control at that particular time, 
and that he had started blo -- marking the 
Jews and putting a-armbands on them. And 
he was taking the books that were written 
by them at that tim
e and everybody was 
saying that this was an evil action. 

Q: Do you remember your 
friends from your multi-ethnic 
neighborh ood ever talking 
about events in 
Europe
 before the war?

A: Yes, I had one that was pretty close. 
He was Polish. He had his family and his 
sister, so -- were older than I was -- or he 
wasn™t, but th-thi -- he had older sisters, 
and they  taught us how to dance,
 and -- and they were the -- the 
hoi polloi
 of th e 
area, actually, for that matter. The girls were
, they were just beau
tiful. And they were 
very, very strongly against a
nything th -- and they were st
rong Catholics. There they 
were, strong Catholics with an Orthodox b
oy in their mi dst, and that was me, and -- 
but we loved each other an-a
nd got along quite well. And they -- they  also were 
aware of wh at was going on, ve
ry, very, very much so.  
Q: Did you ever see any news
reels or anything befo re the war that showed what was 
happening over there? 
A: Yes, I remember th e eye and ears of the 
world that we used to see at -- as -- as a 
youngster. In between features at the movies
 there would always be some news thing 
and we would see what was 
happening and see the crowds and the way that people 
were responding and all the Ge
rmans were responding to 
Hitler
. They were -- it 
seemed now that I look back 
over it, as if they were mesmerized by this man and that 
he was a hypnotist that had them under cont
rol, because it was all seeming so put on, 
but it wasn™t just put on. 
Q: Do you have any 
other memories that stan d out 
in your mind from the time before 
the war?

A: I guess there -- there -- there would be g
ood times and bad times. I remember that 
during th e depression my  -- I wanted to get 
a typewriter and just to get a typewriter 
was an expensive thing at that time, 
it was maybe 50 or 75 dollars, well my  
goodness. And my father said, well, we 
will get you the typewr
iter, but you got to 
teach yourself how to type. And I says oka
y. So he bought a typewriter for me and I 
got the books with it and taugh
t my self how to type. And 
then went to take it in 
school, in high school and the teacher said, after I sat down there, she said, you 

already know how. I™ll give you credit 
for the class. In the meantime, go do 
something else. So I was -- th
at w as something that really
 stood me in good stead. I 
recall that specifically because of -- of ho
w it came about. And most of the things 
that I -- that I wanted as a youngster, bei
ng an only child, I got on the basis that I 
could earn them and -- and use them. Th
ey were not something th at was not 
utilitarian, they were always so
mething that could add to my benefit, or our benefit, 
or our total benefit, or everybody™s benefit.  

Q: Do you have any re
collections of when 
Hitler
 moved into
 Austria
 or 
Czechoslovakia
? Do you have 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Mm-hm, the 
Sudetenland
, yes, very much so. My fa
ther was just upset, I mean 
upset. I rememb er him personally being ups
et, saying how could this -- how could 
this happen, and what is 
Chamberlain
 doing over there in  
England
, mollifying these 
people, you know, and -- and saying that this
 is not right. And the people that we, in

our neighborhood were concer
ned. And th -they were wo
rried about our being -- go-
going to war. My father didn™t want me to 
go in the service either, and he says, you 
know, I already did, I spent 
all my time in the service. 
Why should you have to go, 
again? So -- 
Q: Do you reme mb er any of
 your Jewish friends sayi
ng anything about all these 
events at the time? 

A: Yes, yes. The Jewish friends that I had,
 in fact one of -- one of mine was very 
close, taught me how to play ch ess. He 
was a very intelligent 
youngster, he was a 
couple of years older than I, lived up the st
reet. And he said -- I was playing checkers 
with one of the other neighbors, and he sa
id, did you ever play chess? And I s -- 
never even  paid any attention 
to it, I knew what it was, b u t 
we didn™t have it in school 
back in th ose days. And he says, well I™ll 
bring my  ch essboard down  and I™ll teach 
you how, but you™re never going to beat me
. And I says, oh, come on. Four or five 

years went by and I finally did beat him. Bu
t then that was about the last time I™d 
seen him of -- really, because I left when 
I was 17, I went to college and I was in 
college when I went into the servi
ce. So I never really came back to 
Yo ung sto wn, 
Ohio
 after that. All my memories are from 17 do
wn in stead of up. Just going back to 
visit my  folks is about the only thing th at -- 

Q: What did this fr -- you didn
™t tell me the name of this 
friend who taught you chess, 
but wha-wh at did he say ab
out wh at was happening in  
Europe
?

A: Oh, they -- they -- they sa
id that this -- this was aw
ful. Why are they picking on 
the Jewish people and why are wa -- bu-
but it wasn™t only that, my father was 
pointing out to them that they -- th-that th
ey were incarcerating people in camps and 
things like that that weren™t Jewish, they we
re just politically agai
nst what he was for, 
and that -- and that was what they were 
saying. And -- and so  many of them, of 
course, had relatives th at were there, and they had relatives in 
Romania
, but most of 
the ones that we knew were of Romanian an
cestry, and so that the ones that were 
Romanian would eat Romanian fo od an
d the ethnic mixture, and they spoke 
Romanian. They  didn™t -- the ones that 
I knew did not speak the Jewish -- the 
Hebraic language at all, they spoke Roma
nian. And many of them, when  somebody 
would say, well what are you, said I™m a 
Romanian. Well, so I™m a R o manian Jew, 
what difference does it make? 
Q: How did you learn that 
Hitler
 had invaded 
Poland
 and th e war started? Do you 
reme mb er the mo ment that you first heard about it? 
A: Yes, it was in a newspaper, headlines in a newspaper. Was 
Hitler
 invades 
Poland
, 
and if I remember the 
Sudetenland, 
that -- going in to 
Czechoslovakia
, the same way 
again, newspaper. And of course the ra
dio subsequently , but it was newspaper. 
Q: You mentioned 
Chamberlain
, let me ask you, what was the reaction in this 
country when 
Hitler
 made his deal with 
Stalin
? 
A: At that time they thought that 
Stalin
 was a great guy, because they felt that maybe

Russia
 would be our stalwart pers
on and th at would be against 
Hitler
 and -- and the 
German Reich, except that they had signed th
e pact themselves at th at time. And my 
father had said, was very wary, he said 
it-it™s not worth the pa
per it™s written on. And 
he said, it™s just not going to be of any co
nsequence. And that™s as far as I think I 
could go on that at th
is particular time. 
Q: What was happening in  your life in
 1939 and 1940, where were you? 
A: I was in high school. 1939, four years 
of high school to 1943 is wh en I grad uated. 
Now, I graduated in  January  
of ™43 because of the -- the war, they accelerated certain 
[indecipherable]
 so we had two graduations, one 
in January and one in June. I 
graduated in January  and I think tw
o weeks after graduation I was down  
[indecipherable]
 off the bus in 
Athens, Ohio
 going to 
Ohio
 Un iversity. I had picked  
that as the place to go to school. 
Q: Okay. Let™s stay in high 
school for just a little while. 
A: Mm-hm, yes. 
Q: Do you reme mb er discussions abou
t the war and what was happening in 
Euro pe
 
and also in 
Japa n
 wh ile you were in school? Did 
you have any discussions in th e 
classroom? 

A: Yes, we did. I was a debater to begin 
with and we had consid
erable discussion of 
the political situation at that particular tim
e, a-aside from the ra -- who sh all own the 
railroads, or other topics that we used in
 debating. Bu t there were other groups, like 

 
Interv iew with J o hnBucur

the Greek groups that were -- to put that in
 context, like the Gree
k groups that are in 
college, these were small little splinters 
like the National Honor Society and other 
groups like that. 
YMCA
 and the 
[indeciphera ble]
 and so forth, and that were very 
much concerned as to what was going on 
because we were approaching the ag e of 
which we would probably be se
rv ing in -- in the army  or navy or otherwise if we 
went to war. And some of my -- my confre
res, including my self, 
were leery about the 
fact that we would be goin
g to war. And we were young, but I suppose that we got 
that from our parents, mo stly and I don™t th
ink that was an individualistic thing that -- 
I don™t think that I was that 
-- that intelligent to be able 
to fear that at the time. 
Youngsters at -- in those ages are -- you 
can™t beat them. They
™re -- they can™t -- 
nothing is ever going to happen to them. It 
always happens to somebody else. So as a 
result, we didn™t fear much othe
r than the fact that we might
 have to be going to war.  
Q: One last question -- I hope it™s a last
 question ab out your high school and -- and 
everything else. You menti
oned that your community 
was very multi-ethnic. Was 
there a -- a group of students who were
, you know, more -- no -- traditionally 
American in the sense that their parents we
re born in this country , perhaps even  their 
grandparents. And my  question 
is, did they  see things diff
erently than you, in your 
community? Your friends who were, you know
, first generation Americans in some 
cases. Did the people whose an
cestry -- no, th-the people 
who were more American 
in terms of generations, did they  see things 
differently than you and your friends did?

Q: No, I don™t think so. I think they were 
all pretty -- pretty much -- that™s why I 
mentioned the 
[indecipherable]
 and the 
YMCA
 groups and th ings like th-there -- 
they were comprised of the very same ethni
c groups that I came 
from so that we all 
went to school together and we all learned 
things together and we
 were all exposed to 
the same th ing. Perhaps differently intellectua
lly as to the levels, but nevertheless, it 
was pretty much the same. We™ve had a 50 
year reunion a numb er of years ago, and 
many of them showed up and -- that had su rviv
ed and we lost -- lost
 some of them in 
the war, but it was interesting to see that 
-- the changes th at had occu rred in th ese 
individuals only physically, but mentally they™re
 still in the same area they were in 
then, at the time.  
Q: So you™re saying that -- 
A: In other words, they didn™t really move
 out of their milieu as far a-as that was 
concerned. Many of them improved upon wh
at they were, but many of them did not. 
Q: In retrospect, would you say that youand your friends were pretty politically 
savvy for your age, considering the situation -- 
A: I think my friends, yes, yes. 

Q: 
Pearl Ha rbor
, how did you hear about it? 
A: December seventh. Actually I heard abou
t it by my father telling me that when I 
came home from school that we had been attacked by the Japanese

in the newspapers and the radio and the el
se -- everybody was 
talking about it, you 
know, but that™s the only
 way I heard about it. 
Q: What was your reaction? 
A: Well, my -- ab-absolute horror, because it was unexpected, as far as we knew at 
that time. And the horror of 
the matter was that there was 
no retaliation. I mean, we -- 
we were sitting ducks, and they just 
came and -- just tried to destroy us. 
Q: How old were you on that day? 
A: In 1941, ™25, I was 16. 
Q: Did you wish that you could enlist right away? 

A: 
[laughs]
. Oh, not quite at that tim
e, I -- I was too inculcated
 by my father to sa -- 
want to go to war right away. It was only af
ter I got into college 
that that happened. 
Q: In 1941, in -- before 
Pearl Harbor
 and immediately right after 
Pearl Ha rb or
, did 
you have any id ea what was 
happening to the Jews in 
Europe
? 
A: No. We just knew that 
Hitler
 was being very strongly 
opposed to their function 
and he was selecting them out, as I menti
oned earlier. And that™s about all that we 
knew about it. 

Q: Had you been carefully fo
llowing th e -- the war news? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What languages did you learn in school, if any?

A: Oh, I took Latin all the way through, as much as you can possibly get it, cause it 
was easy for me, being of Romanian ancestry
, and that wasn™t a real -- and I -- I -- I 
took Greek and Romanian, of course, is wh
at I spoke at home, and that was it.  
Q: You said that you we
re a student until 1943? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay . I™m going to pause to change
 tape and we™ll pick up in 1943. 
A: All right.

Bucur

 B. 
And we were now up to June 1943. I™d 
like you to tell me how your life change
d, and walk me through th e changes. 

A: Well, as I mentioned to you earlier, in
 January I graduated in ™43, cause it was 
early graduation and I went to co llege. I ha
d applied to  a number of colleges and we 
felt that going within th e state would be a ma  -- mo re 
[indecipherable]
 you save a 
little more, but th -- and state 
tuition would be less. Howeve
r, I didn™t have to have 
tuition, I was val-valedictorian of my  cla
ss and as a result I had a scholarship . So I 
had a scholarship for actually four year
s, but wa -- during the first year at 
Ohio
 
Univ ersity, a number of us decided that ma
y-maybe we ought to 
go in the service and 
-- instead of just sitting around and waiting,
 that as it so happ
ened, I-I was called up 
for the draft anyway , so it didn™t make any 
-- much difference. 
The thing that™s sur-

surprising is -- is that when
 I was called, we had volunteered, and I was called to go 
to a railroad station and 
-- and from there to go to 
Co lumbus, Ohio
 where there 
[indecipherable]
 four days, and where they were 
gonna decide what to do with us. 
The thing that really troubled
 us a lot was the fact that 
w h en d -- I was -- went to the 
station, my  father and mo ther
 came with me and we went to
 the same station that my 
father went to in the first World War andI si -- was leaning ag ainst a poster and he 
just broke down  and cried. He says, I was 
right there, right there, I saw myself, he 
said, just going. And I was an only son, I wa sn™t supposed to go 
in the service, an 
only son. Also had a perforated eardrum, whic
h kept just about ev erybody out, but it 
didn™t make any difference, th
ey needed  to fill their quotas 
back in the old days, and I 
wouldn™t have told -- told th
em anyhow, so I want -- wanted
 to go in the service. And 
the -- the thing that I rememb
er so clearly was saying good
bye at the -- at that time, 
and -- and hope -- hoping that I would be
 back again at some time later. And 
fortunately I did. 
Q: Can you give me some historical contex
t? What was happening in the war at the 
time that you went into  the 
service? It -- you know, give me some background in 
Euro pe
 and -- and also the war of
 Japan
. 
A: Well, a-at that time
 England
 was having a tough time 
because they were being 
bombard ed and the -- 
Germany
 had just developed the -- the -- the 
V1 
rocket and 
they were shooting these rockets over and I 
rememb er that very well. I was a physics

20
major in high school and I was quite interested
 in the -- that type of development. So 
I followed that pretty closely from that 
standpoint and then  they developed a 
V2
 
rocket as well later, while I wa
s still in the service.
 But the -- the context of the war at 
that time w as that, you know, we -- we have
 to  get into  that European war because 
the ja -- the Japanese have already attacked
 us and we™re already 
at war, and that we 
have to go ahead and th en do so mething ju st 
as my father did before. And I think that 
was the attitude that many of us had.  
Q: How far had 
Hitler
 expanded in 
Europe
 when  you went in? 
A: Oh, he had taken the 
Sudetenland
 and 
Poland
 and -- and there was -- at th at -- 
well, he was in 
France
 and that 
Paris 
had fallen and -- and was in contro l of mo st of 
-- most of -- actually, most of 
Europe
 because he o-obviously
, yo-you know, he was 
-- he had taken
 Sweden -- 
I mean, not
 Sweden, Denmark
. That was a Scandinavian 
country and yes, that™s about 
it and yeah, he was in contro
l of just about everything 
and he was now starting his Ru ssian front. 

Q: Now you™re in the service. Tell me 
about the -- the training. Where were you 
assigned, and -- and walk me through the t -- 
A: Well, we went to -- we were taken to Fort
 Hayes
 in 
Columbus, Ohio
 and we left 
th -- th -- in -- in the evening, and natu
rally nobody is going to be sleeping and all 
night we were up singing and 
playing cards and ju st about everything else. And we 
got there and they fed us breakfast and then
 they put us in a room and ex amined us.

Th -- I mean, you had a -- an 
examination of -- of written tests, that were -- one part 
of it was written and another part was oral 
and then they had a 
test for sound, code, 
Morse
 code, the dot dashes and so forth, wh
ether you™re capable. And we were all 
examined and all that and then
 you were sent to the places 
that they thought that you 
would do well in. I had a pretty hi
gh score, they sent me to Fort
 Sill, Oklahoma
 to 
school. And the school there was an observ
ation sound and flash 
school, and we had 
it quite nice as a matter of fact. And some of 
my confreres that went with me went to 
the cavalry and some of them went to the tank outfit and to the -- the mule teams and 
-- and also, depending upon what their ca
pabilities were, or what they felt their 
capabilities were and whether they were in
telligent enough to handle it. And actually 
while I was at Fort
 Sill 
and th -- learned that that school
 there, I actually got a minor 
in engineering because it was 
in engineering that we had 
to learn how to use a -- a -- 
surveying equipment,
 Theodolites
 and -- and the various other methods of -- of 
marking out areas o-of importance against the 
enemy, that is. I™ll 
describe that a little 
later, if you want. 

Q: So you went thro ugh th is
 training program, and then
 what happened to you? 
A: Oh, the one -- then we were da -- moved overseas. 
Q: When you were sent overseas, what
 was your rank and what was your 
assignment?

A: I was a private. We were all privates, 
nobody had any rank in
 our school, of any 
kind. And we went -- well, actually we were
 -- in part we were one of the largest 
convoys that every crossed the -- th-the 
Atla ntic
 Ocean, it was thousands of ship s. 
Our ship  and our equipment that was given us, 
was as if we were going to be going to  
Africa
 because the African theater was still in
 full force at that time, and we had 
some equipment that was all -- and we -- we 
-- we knew that™s where we were going. 
We ended up in  
Reykjavik, Iceland.
 And from there we watched th e skylin e and 
then dropped down into 
England
 from there. And in 
England
 we got new equipment 
and new things at a new camp. Actually
, we went -- we were stationed at 
Ca rdiff
 in 
Wales.
 And from 
Card iff
 in 
Wales, 
then we were sent to the unit that would need 
you. And our unit was sent to an area called 
[indeciphera ble]
 in -- in 
Devonshire.
 
And it was a -- we commandeered a big castle
 that was there and had nice quarters 
and -- and so -- and trained a
nd trained our people there on
 the wartime basis instead 
of the Fort
 Sill
 basis, where I had the initial traini
ng. War is a little different than the 
books tell you all the time. So we trained there and then  from there we moved on a 
number of occasions, as if we were going to
 go on invasion, but 
we didn™t. And then 
they moved the whole unit to 
Bournemouth, 
which is a resort on the channel, a 
beautiful place. And about ever
y other day we woul
d go out as if we
 were going to 
invade and we didn™t, and mo
nths went by and -- until June sixth, and June sixth the 
invasion occurred and we were sti
ll on the ship . And we only landed

we started out on th e -- the 
fifth and went out and -- an
d went in an d pulled back, 
went in and pulled back. We we
re artillery people, actually, 
and the work that we did, 
there was no place to work, as yet. So as a 
result, until they had 
taken land, there was 
nothing much that we could do. So  they held
 us back a-as mu ch as they could. Plus 
the fact that the bombardments of th
e Germans was pushing our ships back. 
Q: Tell me about those two days between -- 
A: This was 
Omaha 
Beach. 
Q: Right. But the two days you 
said you -- you didn™t get there til 
D
 plus two.  
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: What was the experience of those two days? 
A: It was -- actually, it was rather jocular. 
Everybody wanted to 
get in there and get 
in there and fight, and go -- and -- and get th
is thing over with. And after the f -- the 
first few hours in that you didn™t land, an
d waited to go in, you 
knew that you were 
going to  be going in  soon en ough, it was, 
as I said jocular, 
right, everybody was 
pretty happy about going in . 
Q: Did you have any id ea what was happe
ning to  the people who were on the beach 
at -- you know, the first ones? 
A: Yes, we saw it. 
Q: You could see it? 

A: Yes, we could see it. We could see fro
m -- from our ship ju
st exactly what was

happening, and th-th-the jocularity I™m talk
ing about only was an
 in -- an internal 
feeling of wanting to get out
 th ere and do something. We were not happy about what 
was happening to our people because they 
were -- it was pretty bad because the tide 
came in and they -- they had dug in and th e 
tide, some of them drowned in there, in 
the tide. And they were -- th-the -- 
Omaha
 Beach, if-if you™ve seen some of the 
newspaper articles and so forth, show th ere™
s -- there™s are -- there™
s a large cliff that 
comes down there, that we had to scale that 
p articular cliff before we could go ahead 
and occupy any territory. And th ey were 
having a tough time because there were 
pillboxes all along th e line and they  were 
pretty well en -- they were pretty well 
entrenched. But as you know
 we -- we did do it. And 
D 
plus two, we went in.  
Q: Where were the memb ers of your unit from?  
A: Mo st o f  th e memb e r s o f  my  u n
it were all from the east of the 
Mississippi
 River. 
But we were all pretty mu
ch, you know, cause we were
 picked out by our grades 
from the exams that w e did as to whether you 
were going to go to -- and there was a -
- there was a time there that th
ey wanted to put us in the 
ASTP
, which was army 
specialized training program, in which th 
-- you know, if you got into  that program 
you didn™t have to go to wa
r, wh ich of course was a foolish thing because that -- that 
wasn™t so. What 
Roosevelt
 had done was he created th

training program and took

circumstances he suddenly says, well I™m goi
ng to close that up and then send them 
overseas. Then he sent the best and the flow
er out there because 
they™re the ones that 
could -- could make decisions quickly and rapidly, rather than having a -- other 
groups do-doing it. Bu t we didn™t ga -- we didn™t get into  the 
ASTP . 
Q: Were there any Jews serv
ing with you at the time? 
A: Yes, one of my  group -- closest friends 
in the various unit th
at I was with, the 17
th
 
Field Artillery Observation Battalion was 
Theo do re Sing er.
 And he was also a chess 
player and I told him that he would neve

died.

Q: Did you witness any anti-Sem

A: Okay . 
Q: -- I just wanted to make
 sure. Tell me what action you saw. Now we™re at -- at 
D-
Day
 plus two. 
A: Well, we, actually we got stymied at 
Saint-Lo.
 We had gone in
land that far and 
the action that we saw was getting our units in
 t -- into function. Now, an observation 
battalion is a flash and sound 
unit. And by flash meaning th at there are outposts that 
are put out into no man™s land and you can 
have two of those ou
tposts, generally and 
they look at the enemy territo
ry and they see the flash of a gun, and they have an  

[indecipherable]
 to take they can adjust on th
eir instrument where that flash 
occurred and then th ey triangulate on th e flas
h and they  send it back to a central point 
behind, an d then that™s pinpointed and th
ose coordinates then are s-sent to our 
artillery and our artillery fires on them. That™s
 flash. Now, the s -- the sound unit is a 
little more complicated is be
cause they -- we sunk microphones down a -- a distance 
of about a foot and a half or two, in a se
mi-circular fashion in 
no man™s land so that 
the sound that traveled from 
the gun th at fired there in th
e enemy territory would hit 
microphone number one, before it hit number two or three, and in succession you 

would draw  a line to the microphone that 
was hit and then pinpoint where it came 
from, within about a foot and a half, actua
lly. So we™d  call those coordinates and of 
course the artillery loved us. They said, 
they™re -- they™re our 
boys because they™re 
the ones that tell us w h ere to fire. We can™
t see a thing, yet -- un-un-until we have a

27
coordinate that™s set on. And th -those mi
crophone, sound travels 1100 feet per 
second. As a result, as that hit the 
microphone, it triangulated in on that 
[indecipherable]
. We™d call it back and they would fire.  
Q: How long were you at 
Saint-Lo
? 
A: Oh, we were at 
Saint-Lo
 quite awhile. We lost our captain, Captain
 Brown
 went 
out reconnoitering, he wanted to see whet
her one of the towns over there was t aken 
or not, and there was a little pocket of German
s that th -- supposedly it was taken, but 
wasn™t. But we were stymied at 
Saint-Lo
 for a long period of tim
e, andnevertheless, 
as he traveled with his dr
iver the Germans came up and 
they shot him. The driver 
escaped and was captured, and we -- we captu
red him back later on, but nevertheless, 
we lost the captain. That didn™t -- we were battery 
B
 of the 17
th
 observation battalion.  
Q: Then what ha -- you were there for awhile
, and then when you fi nally were able to 
move, wh at happened  next? 

A: Oh, one -- once we were able to move
, we moved rather rapidly. In fact, 
sometimes they moved so rapidly we didn't
 h ave a chance to set up and the -- our 

artillery would argue with them, hey, wait 
a minute, once you set up, what are we 
going to  fire at, you know, until we get some
body out there. And we were the only 
unit in -- in -- in the 
V-corps
, th-that area, so as a re
sult it was a littl
e difficult for 
them to really have a target, otherwise th
ey™d have to just 
time fire everything. 
Nevertheless, the thing about it was that ou
r -- our -- our feeling was that they were 

 
Interv iew with J o hnBucur  
 
August 18, 2003 
 

 
 
28
moving too rapidly. Bu t we moved ver -- ve
ry , very rapidly and 
once we got up to 
the 
Argentan Fala ise
 area, that -- that -- that was 
the -- that -- they called that the 
Argentan Fala ise 
gap in which we encircled about six or seven comp anies of 
Germans comp letely. And un-u nder those -- while there, we were a -- stopped 
because we had -- had circled th
em and the continue
d to fight down to the last. So we 
-- we went back into  functioning again. And ri
ght about this -- this particular time we 

had heard that there was a -- another sound 
and flash observation 
battalion being sent 
from Fort
 Sill
, th-the 285
th
. And that™s the one that 
had the massacre occur at 
Malm edy 
in 
Belgiu m. 
And that™s at the time of the big 
push that the Germans -- the -
- the -- pushing us into the ocean is what 
they were trying to do. The Battle of the 
Bulge, as they™ve called it. And we 
had co nferred with the eight -- 285
th
 when it came 
there that they can™t functio
n the way they  did at Fort
 Sill,
 that this is war, and that -- 
that it™s a d ifferent thing. But they were
 young, with young 
officers and young -- 
young co mp anies and they just went the wr
ong way. Actually, what really happened 
was that the leader, one of their lieutena
nts was going down  the road, and there was -
- the road signs were made out of wood in 
those days and th ey 
pointed the direction 
of wh ere they -- you were going and -- an
d he said, now this is the route we™re 
supposed  to take, instead of looking at 
his map and being sure. Well, the Germans 
had turned the -- turn
ed  the sign around, and they went
 directly into the Germans. 
And they got caught by the 
SS 
troops and about a hundred and some -- 20 of them or 

 
Interv iew with J o hnBucur

29
so, were massacred right on th e spot. And seve
ral of them did survive that we finally 
got to, but it was a pretty bad situation. 
Q: You mentioned the term time fi
re. I don™t know wh at that means. 
A: Oh. Oh, time fire is when
 artillery fires a shell and th
e shell will hover, essentially, 
over an area and -- and discharg e. In other wo
rds, it doesn™t hit into
 the ground, it hits 
up above the ground and it™s tim
ed so that it™ll go off befo
re it hits th e ground and 
that™s why they call it time fi
re. It™s rather frig h tening b
ecause it covers a greater area 
of destruction than -- than th
e one that hits
 the ground. 
Q: Did you take any prisoners? 

A: Yes, we did. We -- well, we caught th-t
he numbers of them in -- in small pockets, 
maybe five and 10 at a time. But the -- 
we were quite good 
with our prisoners 
because most of the ones that we took we
re old -- old -- old German army. They were 
not the young
 SS 
troops. If it  were  the young
 SS
 troops, they would 
not survive, they 
would have been killed. 
Q: Why? 
A: Because they were the on
es, they were the killers, and we all knew. And we -- I -- 
we could identify them. They  had tattoos 
on th em and usually wh at happened  was 
somebody would co me along an d say that we
 just got so many prisoners, but we 
couldn™t afford to  have men take them back
 and -- and take care of them, because we 
needed  tha -- our own help and our own men 
with -- our units functions coordinately

that you couldn™t spare th
e men. And if they were 
SS
 men they would go back with 
them and -- and if they tried to -- to brea
k away to -- to escap
e, they shot them. 
Q: What did you know at the time ab
out the difference between the general 
Wehrmach t 
and th e 
SS
 as you 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well the -- the old army , they -- they understood a lot better about what it was to 
be a soldier. They were not the killer that
 we  foresaw in the 
young people that we 
met there. The
 SS
 troops were just unbelievable, just as bad as
 Hitler
 was 
unbelievable. 

Q: This judgment that you have of them, 
was this from firstha
nd ex perience or had 
you been told about th
e difference in the s -- 
A: No, fir -- it was firsthand as well as to
ld. I mean, it was the 
-- it was handed down  
from soldier to soldier and fro
m ev -- and we really di 
-- we spared the -- the old 
German army, the 
Wehrmacht, 
the old army , the Germans, th-they knew they were 
captured, they were a prisoner and that was it.  
Q: Did you have much contact with 
the civilians as you went through? 
A: Not very much cause we were always pr
etty active, but we did meet some -- some 
here and there, particularly when  we we
re moving th rough so me area that had been 
cleaned out completely a l -- a lo
t earlier, like when
 we went to 
Paris
, for instance, 
and we -- we were in 
Paris
 and we were -- actually we were -- stayed at 
Le Bourget
 
Airdrome, th-the old name, and we had leave to go out into 
Paris, 
if you wanted to,

but you -- you had to  go in -- in pairs or 
threes or fours because there were German 
snipers in -- living in houses and living w
ith the French that 
were killing off our 
soldiers when they were go
ne. So you couldn™t -- couldn
™t go unless you went in in 
twos or threes or more. And so as a result you didn™t get to see mu ch of 
Paris
 
because nobody wanted 
to go out into so
mething like that.  
Q: Can you give me an idea of the route that you to ok from 
D-Day
 plus two to 
Saint-
Lo
 and then  take me through some of the progression th at -- 
A: Wow. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, 
Paris
 is a -- the -- we started in 
Paris
. Then we had the 
Argentan Fala ise 
gap. We had th-the Battle of the 
Bulge. And then we -- that was at 
Malm edy.
 And 
then from there we went up and -- and crossed the 
Rhine
 and of course I reme mb er 

crossing the 
Rhine
 very well because we captured  the -- the
 Piper Heidsieck 
champagne factory and put guards on it so th
at other units couldn™t come and -- and 
get the wine and the sp irits. That -- that wa
s -- that™s quite someth
ing. That was quite 
something to see. They left 
it intact, they did not destr
oy it, because they could have. 
Why they  did, I don™t know. 
They even left th
e caretakers there w
ith them. They had 
wines and -- and -- and cognacs and so fo

 the caretaker would blow his mind. He 
doesn ™t mi nd if you™re going to  drink the stuf

the ground. So that™s why we se -- we sent
 guards there and we™d have our trucks go 
back every week or so and 
-- and come back with a -- a 
couple of loads of -- of 
champagne and wines and so fo rth. And th
en it was distributed to  everybody else. 
But up until that time 
[indeciphera ble]

Rhine
 at 
Rebagen
 
and from there on
 
we moved in to 
Belgium
 and I remember being in 
Liege
 very well. 
And I remember that -- hi

Liege

Christmas of 1944. 
Q: While you were in 
England
 and also when you crossed

she was something. In fact 
[indecipherable]

horrible person she actually was. She surv iv

bit, and anyway died as an old lady, fro

But anyway, yes, there was quite a bit of 
German propaganda, and they used  to drop 
leaflets on us, and even out in the fiel

You™re just killing people, yo

 there was a lot of Nazi 
propaganda from that standpoint. Everything,
 of course, you know
, from their side of

Q: Once you got into operations in 
Europe
, how much did you kn
ow about what was 
happening to the Jews? Now, you™re alre
ady fighting. How mu ch did you know at 
that time? 

A: Quite a bit. Actually, we 
got most of that from our ﬁ
Stars and Stripesﬂ
 if we 
were ever able to get one and see th -- we
 knew wh at was happening and -- and what 

they were doing and that™s how I knew about
 Kristallnacht 
and that -- when they -- 
they burned th-the -- 
they burned all the books and all 
that. That™s -- you know, all 
that was earlier but this is what all recapitu

in our -- our 
ﬁStars

commanders and everybody else that were
 there who were well informed on what 

was going on, pretty mu ch. We did know th

Q: Be-Before we go into 
Buch enwald

you really knew and how mu ch  of it did you

experience? 

A: Well, we knew th at there were camps.
 We did not know wh at was happening 

inside the camps, because even
 the people around those camps, and I can tell y ou that

now because I talked to many 
of them, claimed they did not
 know, but that™s not true. 
I think they all knew. I think all the Ge
rmans knew wh at was going on. They  were 
bringing in -- oh, excu se me 
-- they were bringing in pe
ople into these camps at a 
certain numb er and the camp s could only ho
ld a certain amount, and th ey had to go 
ahead and get rid of that amounts that™s goi

weren™t close to dying, they would go ahead 
and kill them in orde

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
John Bucur.
 This is tape number two, side
 A. 
And you had been  telling me 
that you had crossed the 
Rhine
, and then tell me w h at 
happened  after you crossed the 
Rhine
. 
A: Well, we -- actually were going in -- into 
Germany
 itself at this particular point 
and we were approach ing a -- 
Weimar 
and -- and that particul
ar area. And the third 
army  had co me in to the fight
 fo r about several weeks or almo st a month or so befo re, 
and they  were pushing out farther even 
ahead of us. And we were moving quite 
rapidly, at a -- as a matter of
 fact. And we were just ta
king the towns as they came, 
and as we came to 
Weimar
, that™s where we came close to 
Buch enwald
 and 
Buchen wald  
was very close to the -- to
 this large city and we 
were told that when we 
were on bivouac there that th
ere was a camp here, and that it -- it was a camp of -- of 
political as well as Jew ish prisoners. And we 
said -- not we said, they said they would 
take us through the camp . And there was a se
lect number of us that went through and 
I had a camera and took some of the pictures 
that we have here. And I -- I have to tell 
you this, that there was proba
bly one of the worst things 
that I™ve seen in my whole 
lifetime. A nd I became a surgeon after all 
this, and I™ve seen some pretty awful 

things in the operating room, and ever
ything tha -- injuries from cars and 
[indecipherable]
 but it was nothing like this. This -- 
this was a -- a horrible situation

that should never have been
 allowed to occur. And as I™ve mentioned earlier, I -- the 
people claimed that they didn™t know 
wh at was going on, but you could smell the 
camp from miles away, because they had cr
ematoriums and they  would incinerate 
some of the people that they
 had, once they died, and some
 of them that hadn™t even 
died yet, for that matter. I understand that th
ey  were functioning at full blast when the 
camp was captured, and that they were tryi
ng to clear their -- their ro oms in the 
crematorium, and there were some of -- of th
em that were still alive, and they were 
just pushing them into the -- 
into the furnaces wh
ile they were still 
alive. So we knew 
a little bit about what was going 
on there. Then when
 we walked in to
 see it, to see 
that there was a -- a basement underneath 
the crematorium in which they had big 
hooks, like sky hooks on th e wall, and they  
had bodies that were
 hung on these sky 
hooks and they would hang th
em there until they either di
ed or what happened to 
them, and then put them on an elevator an
d send them up to the crematorium, and 
there dispose of them by bu
rning them. And the stench, 
as I said, was -- why these 
people didn™t know something was happeni
ng there was beyond
 me. But they had 
quotas that they a-apparently 
had that said that they had to have at least 80 people die 
per day because they had to replace them 
with 80 new ones that
 were coming in. At 
least that™s the smallest number 
[indeciphera ble]
 there would be mo re than 80 that 
died during the day. Ho w some of these pe
ople survived as long as they did, we 
could not understand. When we came in, th
ere were some of them that were still

37
walking around, but we were wa
rned not to try to feed th em or try to do an ything. 
They were under medical con -- surveillance 
and so forth. But it was just atrocious 
and that™s wa -- that™s how I got these pictures
 that I -- that I ha 
-- that I took. Th-This 
was still there cause it was s
till fresh. This hadn™t been 
-- hadn™t been cleaned up or 
moved or anything, and that™s wh
y they wanted us to see it.  
Q: What was the passage of time between 
when the camp was fi
rst entered by the 
American soldiers a
nd you got to go in ? 
A: Oh, I think th ere was -- it mu st have be
en a week or so -- oh, perhaps -- it might 
have been tw o or three days, or a week. 
I really don™t know, because th-there was 
talk about it earlier and we -- and -- and one 
of the visits was scrubbed and I do -- I 
don™t know what the reason was,
 but then we even
tually  did go. So it had to be -- it 
had to be s-several days, but these bodies, th
ey wouldn™t let them 
just sit there all the 
time, so it had to be pretty fast. It had to be. 
Q: Why did they tell you not to feed th
e prisoners that were walking around? 
A: Oh, because if they got f
ood, their stomachs were contra
cted to an extent that food 
would kill them. And so the -- and -- and they
, of course, didn™t know, and so  th -- 
but the soldiers, who -- we were very good
 about that. Everybody wanted to help 
them, to give them something, candy bars, 
anything that we had, but that -- that 
wasn™t doing them any good
. So that was the fear.

Q: I™d like you to -- to walk
 with me through the camp. 
For -- a-approach the camp 
with me as in your -- no -- as you reme
mb er approaching the camp , and take me 
through the entire experience. First, what 
did you see as you ap
proached and what 
did you hear, and you know. 
You told me that there wa
s a stench, but what else? 
A: Oh, th-the stench, of course, was overp
owering as you -- as you walked  in, but 
there was a large gate as we walked into 
that, and there was a 
compound where there 
were posts that were stuck in the ground, 
and I understand that 
those were whipping 
posts, and a 
[indecipherable]
 somebody was chastised 
and whipped and -- and so 
forth on these posts and tied to them, 
and left there sometimes overnight and 
otherwise. And then there were a series of
 barracks that were -- were approximately 
15 or 20 feet apart and they were maybe 1 50 - 200 feet long, an
d maybe 25 or 30 feet 
wide. And there was an aisle in the middle of each barrack and as -- as we entered on 
the first barrack that we entered, there we
re still people in th-their area, these were 
some that had surviv ed, obviously. And they  
were in their niche, as they were -- as -- 
as they called them, this is
 my  spot. Surp risingly enough
, we also saw some that -- 
some women that were kept as prostitutes 
for the camp people. 
And they were, of 
course, favored by the Germans because they
 wanted them to still continue to 
function. Bu t anybody in the camp that had anything to  do with th em was 

immediately ostracized amongst the peopl
e, from the way I understand from -- I 
talked to several of them 
for that matter, I talked to
 so me of them that spoke

Romanian and -- and they we
re Romanian Jews, and not 
political prisoners and they 
op -- from what they told me, 
you know, these people that were ostracized that way 
were shunned completely and actually, ev
entu ally they  would die out. Th-The 
Germans would -- would have them killed or
 -- or something would happen to them, 
or something would happen to them amongst them, for that matter. 
Q: When  you sp oke to some of the prisone
rs, can you remember ex actly what they 
said to you? 
A: They didn™t believe that 
they were re -- that they 
were free, that they could 
possibly be free. That this couldn™t possi
bly be happening to them. Their -- that 
freedom was the next step that they were go
ing to see. They all 
anticipated dying.  
Q: And the women that you said that we
re the prostitutes at the camp , do you know 
what their ethnic backgro
und -- were they Jewish? 
A: N-No, they were just all 
-- I -- no, they were not only
 Jewish, no. They were all -- 
all ethnic groups. I™m sure there we
re Greeks and Italians and -- 
Q: What else did you see inside the 
camp besides the prisoners? Did you see 
anything of the way the guards that were -- 
A: Well, we went to the crematorium and as
 -- I saw that, th-the ovens. There were 
six or -- six or seven ovens in there that
 I can remember. And 
they were just like 
what you see, you know, in -- on television to
day when  you see the mo rtuaries, with -
- with the slots that go in it, the fire unde rneath it and the -- and th-they were -- there

were still b odies that -- they 
turned off the fire, but there 
were still some bodies that 
were still there, that we were able to s
ee. So the -- and we saw d-downstairs where 
they -- the hooks were. 
They -- they said that
 they reserved this 
for -- for fliers, for -- 
for our air force people. Why that would be
 as -- I don™t understand, but interrogation 
or something like th at, I don™t have any idea why they  would want to interrogate once 
they got to this particular 
camp  is beyond me. I should th
ink that by the time they got 
there, they were pretty well interrogated. 
Q: Had their been any Americans liberat
ed from that camp , to your knowledge? 
A: Oh, there were some, but I didn™t see any. 
Q: Did you see any part of the camp  wher
e the Germans had lived, or the guards had 
work ed or anything? 

A: Yes. I™m glad you mentioned that because
 I almost forgot ab
out it completely. The 
commandants wife had quarters there, and 
I believe they called her the bitch of 

Buchen wald
. And she had lamps in her -- ooh, th
at still runs up a

now just to say, lamps made
 of the skin of the prisone
rs. Lampshades, that is. And 
she had lamp s that had bones that was the supporting 
[indeciphera ble]

furniture and furnishings a
pparently that was woven and -- and -- out of skins. 
Q: What kinds of skins? What skins did sh e --

of skin.

Q: When she would select a 
skin, for whatever purpose, 
was there -- could you tell if 
there was any reason why she se
lected this particular sk in? 
A: I was given to understand that she was quite
 particular about what type of skin she 
was going to  use, wh ether it was clear or wh
ether it had blemishes on it, or what. But 
I don™t know anything else, other than that. 
Q: Did you see any skins with tattoos? 

A: Yes. Yes. They tattooed their own, too. The 
SS
 men were tattooed. They had a 
tattoo over their arm as you -- you know, 
that™s the way we identified them many 

times.  

Q: Besides her quarters or her office, whatever area of -- of her -- 
A: I saw her living room, that™s the only on
e tha-that we were escorted through. I

husband, if -- if she had a husband. 

Q: Is there anything else about the ca

 that it was a relief to le

upon leaving it, you got a feeling of -- of re
al loss, of -- you know, when  we went in 
there, you go -- you went through 
Weimar
 and the -- the German people were there 
laughing and scratching and having fun 
and en-enjoying themselves. And then  when  
we came back out again, they were still there, but it didn™t mean anything. And it felt

 but we knew that they

about it. We didn™t feel there was. 
Q: How long did you spend in the camp?

Q: After your visit to the camp, did you

well. So th-th -- it took us a long time, that is months to 
go ah ead and -- and si -- and make inroads in

freed them, and that freedom was a heck of 
a lot better than just being subservient to 
Germans. But I just continued my  college

Q: What courses did you ta
ke when you were studying? 
A: Oh, I took Abnormal Psychology, which wa
s very, very great, because the French 
had th -- all these abnormal people, they we
re allowed to have their own enclav es and

everything. So I -- I had a -- a -- a field th
a -- to work in eas
ily. Homosexuality was a 
-- a n-not very well known at that time, at least in this country  it wasn't, or if it was it 
was behind bars some where. Bu t there they 
were -- they -- they 
lived an open life. 
And we studied i -- Abnormal Psych. I took, 
surprisingly, 
enough German. I needed a 
language, so I took German and I had Eng
lish and one other subject, chemistry.  
Q: During your time in the service, di
d you meet anybody famous or infamo us? 
A: In the service itself, no, but I met him 
after the service. And I can™t think of his 
name, it™s the -- the German that defected 
here that work ed on th e atom bomb. He 
lived not too far away from us
 in -- I can™t think of his 
name and I know it just as 
well as I know my  own. 
Q: Well, maybe it™ll come to you later. 
A: Maybe so. He™s the one wh
o wo rked  on the atom bomb. 
Di-Did all -- di-did -- and 
had -- had work ed on the 
V2 
and 
V -- V1 
initially there, and cam
e here and -- oh gee. 
Q: Maybe it™ll come to  you. 
A: All right. 
Q: We can get back to th
at. When you were discharg
ed, what was your rank? 
A: I was a sergeant.  
Q: And did you have 
any military honors? 
A: Well, I had five bronze stars and a Meda
l of Honor and all those others, and I was 
injured once, but a whole bunch of us
 were injured wh en one of those

our unit, but it didn™t -- we didn™t walk down 
to get our Purple Heart, so we didn™t -- 
there was no in -- no serious injury. 

Q: When you came back, what did you tell 
people about your experiences overseas? 
A: Well, I think ma -- th-the -- the most out
standing th ing that they wanted to know 
about was -- was the -- the ca
mp . And then  that, of course, was something th at was 
ingrained. That™s why I remember as much 
as I™ve do -- have al -- although I™ve tried 
to put it out of my mind. It was -- they want
ed to know if it was real or not. There -- 
th-there are some people that say tha-that
 it was all a put-up job. Tha-That is, of 
course is not -- not true. And th is is onl
y one camp. I mean, th
ere were Polish camps 
and there were -- they were all over. 
Q: Was it difficult for you to re
turn to civilian life at all? 
A: Not at all, because I was home, as I said, December seventh and one week after 
that I was back at college, wh
ere the dean had sa
id when I left th
at there will be a 
place for me no matter when I got back. And 
I called him, he was still there, and he 
says, come on back, 
John
. And I went back  and s -- went back in to pre-med, you 
know, a pre-medical course and continued. 
Went through summer, tr
ying to catch up 
to the years that I™d lost, 
and caught it all up and gradua
ted 1940 -- ™48, actually 
when  I went to medical school in 1947, b
ecause my  grades were so good that they  
wil -- they were going to give me cred
it for a year of medical school towards 
graduation, so that I could b -- be in me
dical school for a year and graduate the

following year. So I got my degrees the fo
llowing year, I™d already had one year of 
medical school at the time. So it was kind of
 nice. Actually, I had almo st caught up to 
my self. So then four years of medical sc
hool, graduated 1951 and was an intern at 
Western 
Pennsylvania 
Hospital in 
Pittsburgh.
 I went to 
Pitt
, and subsequent to that, 
while I was at 
Pitt
 and I had the -- been an intern a
nd an extern as well. My grades 
were good and when  you we
re a good student you could 
live outside, and I lived in 
the hospital. And the-they challenged me quite
 a bit as to what I was going to  be and 
I was going to be a surgeon. And th ey said
, well, wen -- we™re going to send you to 
school. So here comes school ag ain and I says
, fine. And they sent me to University 
of 
Penn sylv ania
, the graduate school of surg ery. And I spent a year there doing 
nothing but surgery. And while 
there is when I met the great

A: They sent me to the University of 
Pennsy lvania
 and while there I spent a year 
doing nothing but graduate surgery, and su
rgeons from all over 
the world who were 
gathered there and I was the baby, by the wa
y, I was the youngest one in the class. 
And while there is when 
Bailey
 did his first heart surgery, at 
Harmon 
Hosp ital there. 
And we as students there were allowed to
 go out and ob-observe
 all the types of 
surgeries that were done within the univers
ity™s per view, and at the University of 
Pennsylvania
, Dr.
 Grof, G-r-o-f
 was the neurosurgeon ther
e and he asked if I would 
help him on one of his craniotomies, opera
ting on the head. I said, I™ll be glad to, 
because I had a lot of experience in surg
ery from where I had come from. And I did. 
And I was so taken by him while we were 
operating that he challenged me to the 
point whereby he said, I will 
get you a residency, if not 
right here, I know where y -- 
I want you to go. And I said, are y ou -- he
 said, you™d make a great neurosurgeon. I 
said, well I -- I just wanted to
 be a surgeon at that time an d he se -- I says, but that 
means another five or six years. And up
 until that particular
 point, you know, I 
[indecipherable]
 I wondered whether that was a wi
se decision to make, but I™m -- I 
dil -- I was delighted with what we were doi
ng, so I said yes. Anyway, then he was 
one of my champions as far as referral was 
concerned and I applied to several places 
that he had w-wanted  me 
to go, and ended up under 
Jack French 
in 
Lo ng  Bea c h, 
California
, th e 
V.A. 
hospital, and spent five
 years there. And in that fifth year I was 
chief of neurosurgery at the hospital because
 Jack French 
got married, and he wa --

married the diva
 Dorothy Kirsten. 
In -- in her day -- she™s 
the one that was thrown 
out of 
Russia
, by the way, because of her attitude
. They said -- of her American 
attitude, that is. Persona non grata, 
they called her. This was back in 
Stalin™s 
days. 
Anyway, the thing about it was that he -- an
d he wanted  to take a year off as a 
sabbatical and he says, you™re going to 
be chief. And I went from, I think it was 
9,000 dollars a year to 30,000 dollars a year
 as chief. Wow, talk about living it up. I 
still remember that very well. I was marrie
d at that time and we
 had our first child 
there in -- in 
Lo ng  Bea c h. 
And things were pretty toug
h on 9,000 dollar a year and 
we lived just a -- where 
Disneyland
 was built. And th e kids
 in my youngster™s age 
group were asked to co me to try out 
Disneyla nd
 before they even 
opened it. And so  
he got to know pretty well 
what the rides were going to be and everything else. But 
we didn™t stay there, I wanted 
to come back east again. The 
California
 type of life 
was not my type of life. 
[indecipherable]
 as I always say, the -- there was always 
somebody ru nning around with  somebody el
se™s wife. A nd it was just different. A 
bar on every corn er, school three sessions 
a day. Some of them were four hours 
apiece and they™d have the three sessions
, three different gr
oups. Th-They were 
crowded. So anyhow, I-I wanted to come ba
ck here, and I came. When I finished I 
came back here. And the reason I did come to 
this particular area is because before I 
went overseas I was stationed at Fort 
Mead
. And wh en I had got leave wh ile I was 
stationed at Fort 
Mead,
 I came into this area and came into 
Arlington
, and I loved

Arlington. Arlington
 was just gorgeous. Still is, but it™s -- it™s -- it was just 
gorgeous. I said, one of these days I™m going 
to live there. And that™s what I did, I 
came here. There was one other neurosurgeon  here and we went into  partnership 
together and everybody in the 
District of Columbia
 kept saying, what are you -- 
what are you going over there, that™s on the 
other side of the river. Nothing is every 
going to happen there. So the 
thing that happened is we 
built all these hospitals and I 
was the founder of 
Fairfax
 Ho spital, the founder of 
Northern Virginia
 Do cto r ™s 
Hosp ital. The founder of National Orth opedic Hospital. So
 we built our own 
hospitals and we -- w -- and it -- it -- it was 
quite nice and had a 
nice practice, and I 
practice in what -- what I refer to as th
e golden age of medicine, where there was no 
Medicare or Medicaid and not everybody 
was entitled to ever
ything unde
r God™s 
creation. They got treated free in most of my
 practice. B ack early on, 40 percent of it 
was gratis, it -- it was free patients, so -- but
 I made my first do
llar when I was about 
36 years old. And ev erybody says, boy, it ta
kes a long time to be a neurosurgeon. It 
does. And I think it™s going to be even 
longer, they™re going to  make it longer.  
Q: How many ch ildren do you have? 
A: Well, actually I have three and I™m -- 
I™m in my second ma
rriage, we™ve been 
married 22 years. And she had two, so we 
have five all togeth er. And all -- all of 
them are out of school, graduated, they™re
 all in their 40™s. 
They™re attorneys, no 
doctors. Lot of attorneys. One™s a judg
e. So we™re -- we™re doing very well.

Q: What did you tell them about 
your experiences during the war? 
A: Oh my, as -- as they were growing up, 
they -- they know most of these stories, 
cause they would ask me, and I -- I -- I --
 we would sit sometimes after dinner and 
just -- just talk about thi
ngs in general, and th-th -- 
these subjects would come up. 
And they™d ask -- they ask particularly 
about the atrocities and the camps and so 
forth, knowing -- and they know, of course 
that I have th -- had these pictures and 
they all saw these, so they kn
ew that this -- this was some
thing that did really happen. 
Q: Do you ever speak public
ly about your experiences? 
A: No.  
Q: In what ways do you think that this
 experience has changed you in your life? 
A: I can™t say maturity because once you 
got into the service you became mature no 
matter whether you wanted to or not. I wasn
™t -- when I came b
ack from the service -
- I -- I went into the service as a young co
llege boy that probably had a beanie on his 
head. I came back from the se
rvice as a mature man that never belonged to a -- a 
fraternity or anything like that, because th
at was a lot of bunk, as we felt coming 
back. So  we set up our own organizations. But I think that my  entire wartime 

experience gave me a sense of understanding
 of what man can do to man. What -- 
what had happened in  
Germany
 should never happen agai
n, and I understand that 
it™s been happening in some 
of these other countries, in 
Africa
 and otherwise. And 
that just recently 
Idi Amin
 just died and he was one of these 
Hitlers.
 He was -- and

he was responsib le for millions of deaths 
as well, and he -- he doesn ™t have the 
notoriety that 
Hitler
 had obviously, but I think he -- the -- the people 
[indecipherable]
 know that he™s done this.  
Q: Is there anything else that you™d like to 
add befo re we conclude? Is there anything 
that we haven™t discussed that
 you want to talk about? 
A: No, but it™s just been wo
nderful to have you ask me 
the questions, because it woke 
up memo ries that I™m going to  be talking abou
t for the next couple of weeks, I think, 
a-again. And I want the children to know a

think that™s a good th ing. And so 
I want to thank
