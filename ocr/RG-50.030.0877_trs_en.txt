for you.
 

Q: We™re going to start at the very beginni ng. I™d like to find out as much as I can 

about your prewar life. I know that in some cases, with some people, that can 
present some challenges. The reason why we t ry t o go in as much det ail as we can, 
is that we want to get a sense of the world that  you were born into, the forces that 

shaped you 
Œ the first i nitial ones, and get a picture of what this worl d was, before it 
waslost. So, m y veryfirs
t question is, could you tell me the date of your birth?

th
, 1933.

A: It did make a difference. 
Q: And Œ and anot her i nterview that I™ve recently done, also illustrat es Œ you know, 
there are pieces of the puzzle that you don™t realize until somebody l ife story is put 

out in front of you. It has to do with 
Poland
 having been Œ part of it having been 
part of the Russian empire, part of it being sal Œ Austro-Hungarian, and part of it 

having gone to 
Prussia
 since, you know, in the 19
th
 century. So, when it became 
Poland
, many of the people who were part of the Austro-
Hungarian empire
, who 

were born i n 
Poland
, t hen went to 
Vienna
.

from 
Yad Vashem

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: That™s what sta ys. 

A: And that™s the one that™s the most popular in this country, so Œ  
Q: Can you Œ do you have any memory of your father as, you know, doing 
something? Do you have memory of him working, do you have memory of him at 
h ome?
 
A: I th Œ I don™t have a memory of m y father i n a grocery store. He was Œ he was 

not a well person, and I wa Œ recognize that. And it was m y mot her that was a 

strong Œ seemed to me the strong person at  home. 

Q: So let™s  step back a little bit. Can you tell me that Œ one of the questions I usually 

ask is, how did your parents support the famil y, t hat is, and you kind of answered it 
now. So what was your father™s business? What did he do?  
A: The y had a smal l grocery. 

Q: Was it a neighborhood grocery store? 

A: I Œ I don™t know, but I had Œ I have a feeling that it was not too far away.  

Q: Oka y. And, did your mother work with hi m t here? 

A: Yes. 

Q: All right. Do you have any memory of your neighborhood in 
Vienna
?

A: No. I have very l ittl e memory of my childhood, of friends, of school. 
Q: What about the place you lived, your Œ 

A: That™s a question mark in m y mind. My mother™s letters had an address that she 

wrote letters to me from. But, in later years, we went to that address in 
Vienna
, and 

it did not seem like the same pla Œ 
I 
Œ I did not relate to it in any way.  
Q: It might have been that she had to move.  
A: Yes. Yes, I learned that, yes. 

Q: Yeah. So Œ 

A: And I don™t know what the address was on m y records, because I had no Œ 
m y 
records were private with the agenc y. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So I never found out much information about where I li ved, and so forth. 
Q: So again, in your mind™s e ye, you Œ do you have any i mage of a particular room 
from your childhood, a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen? 

A: No, I don™t. 

Q: Oka y. Do Œ 

A: My Œ m y most vivid memory is of my mother and me going to the streets for a 

parade. And it was an i mmense parade, and all  the Nazi banners were Œ and 

bunting, were all over t he place. And I remem ber the sound of the boots of the

soldiers, and loud music, and a lot of 
sieg heil s
. And I di dn™t know anything about 
what was going on, and m y mother just held Œ I remember her squeezing m y hand, 

and I said, what is this? And she said, it™s going to be very bad. That i s the only 

vivid memory that I have. 

Q: Wow.
 
A: I remember the pounding on t he pavement, on the street, and Œ 
Q: What can you tell me about your mother? Is she someone who is more in your 

memory than your father? 

A: Yes, yes, but not as much as I would Œ I would think. Not as much as I would 

think I Œ I would remember of my mother. She did embroidery, and she worked in 

the store. And I thi nk I was taken care of by another woman when she went to the 

store. I don™t remember the store. I don™t Œ I don™t know whether I™m protecting 
m yself, or Œ I have no memories of huggi ng m y mother, kissing my mother. I don™t 
have those memories. 

Q: Or of the reverse, of her kissing you and hugging you? 

A: Yes, yes, I Œ I don™t Œ I don™t have those memories. I don™t have any memories 

of m y schooling, of friends. That™s Œ that™s been a blank. That™s bi Œ the whole Œ  

that Œ until  I 
came t o the 
United States
, and even for about a week or so, until I 

went into m y first foster home, that  has all been a blank.

Q: And to this da y? 
A: And to this da y, I don™t have a memory of being in m y mother™s arms, and there 

is one memory that I do remember. We were sitting in a chair at the end of Shabbat, 

and waiting for the stars to come out. That  is a memory. That™s a Œ that Œ that is a 

good memory. And, we were waiti ng for the stars to come out, and my mother said 
that there™s a moment j ust after Shabbat ends, and the stars come out, something 
like that, she said, you can see God. 

Q: Oh. 

A: And I remember bei ng in a chair with her. That Œ that Œ that™s about the closest 

memory that I have. Even leaving, I Œ I remember that she told me I was coming to 

the 
United States
, and that another Jewish mother would take care of me, and Œ and 

that I had to be very healthy. And these Œ these are the things that I Œ I remember 
being in a shul. I think it was a shul, and peopl e were crying, and she made me 
leave.
 My father was holding a Torah, and I just assume now that that must have 
been a 
Yizkor
 service, because people were cryi ng, and she wanted me to leave. 

Q: For those peopl e, and myself included, who don™t know what a 
Yizkor
 service 

is, could you tell us? 

A: It™s usually on 
Yom Kippur
, and it™s a Œ it™s a part of the service t hat remem Œ 
where you remember your parents, and you say a memorial pra yer for Œ for those

who™ve Œ you™ve left behind. And in the old days, they didn™t want children around. 
And I Œ I remember m y mother telling me to go outside. So I Œ I Œ I think those 

three Œ three things. I don™t remember singing with m y father, but  I Œ I know I di d. I 

know I did, but I don™t remember it . The chair, sitting in the chair, wat ching the 

stars, the me Œ the shul, and the parade. The parade is the most vi vid Œ 
Q: Vivid. 
A: Œ thing that I have. 

Q: Do you have any m emory of their personal ities? 

A: No. I have a feeling that m y father might have been more outgoing than m y 

mother. I think my mot her was very quiet. I™m really not sure. 

Q: So, I have a few questions that probably, if you know the answers t hey would 

not be from memory, but from thi ngs you found out. But you can let me know. Do 
you know what happened to your father, and t o the grocery store, once there was an 
anschluss 
of aus Œ of 
Austria
 to 
Germany
, and the Nazi s took cont rol? How your 
family was affected.

A: And m y father was t aken by a truck to some sort of labor camp. 
Q: Do you remember seeing a truck? 

A: There Œ there were t rucks in the neighborhood that took men back and forth. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The y came back at night, and the y were rounded up i n the morning. And this 
went on for a ti me, and one night my father came home, and he died. 
Q: At home? 

A: At home, yes. He was not well to begin wit h, and Œ 

Q: Do you remember anything about that? 

A: We had a Œ I guess we had a funeral, we have Œ I remember being in the 

cemetery, and I know my father had a grave. It was bigger than I was, and it was Œ I 

remember it being green, and I remember m y mother put ting m y Œ 
a hat 
Œ hat on 
me, and she alwa ys tried to hide my Œ m y brai ds. And I remember that I felt like a 

boy when she did that. Also during the parade, she put a hat on me and stuck m y 

braids Œ I don™t know why, but I Œ I do remember that we Œ that she seemed to be 

protected of Œ protective of my long braids that I had. So Œ  

Q: Oka y. Any Œ are there any feelings that you associate, any emot ions? I mean, 

there are the ones that we would normally think when a child loses a parent. 

A: I don™t have that  Œ

friends, of neighbors. I don™t Œ

A: I just Œ thinking I do remember that he had a large gravestone. I don™t know how 
m y mother arranged it, but she did. 
Q: Do you remember ever feeling hungry? 

A: No. No. 

Q: Oka y. So even when the store was lost , you don™t remember hunger, as a resul t 

of that? 

A: I think Œ I think Œ I t hink m y mother came home with some sort of a pot. And 

now that I™m older, I would assume that it was Œ could it have been through Œ 
from 
a 
Œ some sort of a soup kitchen? I remember her coming home with a Œ a pot. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: So I guess I have more memories than I thi nk I do.

Q: Yeah. We often find, you know, when we start an interview, and we start a 
process that Œ one t hought comes up, and it tri ggers another thought, and it triggers 

a third thought Œ 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Œ and so on. And so Œ 
A: Because I don™t Œ I don™t speak about t his very Œ  
Q: Of course. 

A: Œ very often.

h a 
Œ a tight lid 
on it. And at that time, after my Œ after we lost  the store, we went to live with m y 
Tante Lotte
(ph), who was my mother™ssister
-in-law.  
Q: So this is very interesting, you just anticipated the next questi on I was going to 

ask. Because it sounds Œ the picture I™m getting, first of all, is, from what you tell 

me, i

A: No. 
Q: And so then I wanted to ask about, how do you know 
Tante
 
Lotte
(ph)? How Œ 
how does she figure in the story? 
A: We went  to live with her. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And then it was the three of us. It must  have been an apartment. And I remember 

one night we heard people with boots, and they came into our apart ment. I think it 

wasn™t the first apart ment they wer Œ we Œ we heard it, we heard it. And the y came 
in the apartment, and t hey were shouting and Œ and the y were looking at things and 
throwing t hings around. I don™t know what they were looking for. 

Q: Were 
Œ were there me Œ were these men? 
A: These were Nazis, and the y were in uniform, with beautiful, black high boots, 

and hats, and Œ so that t hey were not the Œ t he Brownshirts that we saw in the 

parade,the y were much morewell
-dressed. And there were two or three of them, I 
don™t remember. And after they looked to see what the y needed to see, we were sort

of cowering in the cent  Œ in the c Œ in the corner. And when the y l eft, m y mother 
went to thi s little stove, it had a litt le ashtray in it, for ashes from t he woodstove, 

and she had put some Œ some dol Œ some money i n there, wrapped Œ wrapped 

around into a tight bundle. 

Q: Like in a cloth, or something? 
A: I don™t know Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ but she Œ I remember her looking in this little drawer, and the m one y was 

there, they didn™t find it. And I remember us being very happy at t hat time.

A: So this woman was Œ contacted the museum t o see if there was anyone she could 

speak to that would be a contact for her to do her paper. And 
the y cal led 
me and 
asked me if I would speak to her. So this was all through the comput er. I was just 
learning the comput er. 

Q: And the internet . 

A: And the internet . And we had this wonderful correspondence, and I told her 

everything t hat I remembered, and she did a book. I was not the onl y child that she 

Œ 

Q: Featured. 
A: Œ featured, there were others. None of Œ none of the nine. None of the nine 
children I came with. Most of them were older, and they came before me. And she 

ha Œ she di d all thi s research, and she found the lists of the nine children. 

Q: So even though you were the only one she featured, she™s the one through whom 

you got the list of the others? 

A: Yes, yes.

A: I tried. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The first Œ first person I was able to contact, I spoke t o his wife, and she said he 
would not speak t o me. She was very interested, but she said he was i ll, and he did 
not like to talk about hi s past. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So Œ but he sai d that he knew that one of the boys was deceased. 

Q: Oh. 

A: So that was two people.

A: And then I reached

Melanie

Œ I™ve forgotten where. But she found the obituary. It wasn™t in 
Balti more

c 
Œ I can™t remember where it was. But she had died only a 
few months after I got the list. I was Œ I could have Œ I could have found her. 

Q: You didn™t. It™s Œ you know. 
A: I could have found her. So my daught er found her obi t. 

Q: Oka y.

Q: Now you™re down t o three. 

A: Three. The other three, two were sisters, and one I c Œ I could not ever locate 

those. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 
A: So that was the nine of us.  
Q: Can we cut for a second? 
[brea k]
 So before lunch, we were talking Œ before 
lunch we were talki ng about many different things, and it Œ 
but we 
Œ I think we 
brought your story up until the poi nt where you got to 
Baltimore
.  
A: Yes. 

Q: And because we have Œ we have, as a museum, many different collections, and 

someti mes we™re able to find pieces of a person™s story through some of the other

collections that we™ve got. And j ust recently, by coincidence, one of my colleagues, 
who has been very i nvolved with documenting your story, was able to find this. 

And this i s 
Anatol Steck
,
 
so I™m going t o pass on the mi crophone to hi m. 
[technical i nterruption]
 So before our break, we had talked about your story i n 

many different ways, going back t o your cousin, that Œ where you found that 
amazing package from your mother. And I thi nk chronologically we brought it up to 
the point where you got to 
Baltimore
. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And now I want to turn, briefly, this part of our interview over to my colleague 

Anatol Steck
, because he has something else t hat he™d like to share wit
h you,
 that 

we think is relevant to your story, that he found just a little while ago. 
Q2: The museum recentl y acquired the research collection of 
Leonard
 and 
Edi th 
Ehrlich
, t wo survivors from 
Vienna
, who spend a good 40 years researching the 
history of the Jewi sh community 
Vienna
 duri ng the Holocaust. And having 
emi grated t o the 
United States
, they spent many years interviewi ng survivors from 

Vienna
 who were in the 
United States
. And those survivors, and these interviews 
were done i n the 1970s, so the survivors who m t he y interviewed were often 

individual s who had a role within the administration of the Jewish community 

Vienna
. The research collection includes dozens of these audio cassette tapes,

which the museum onl y recently digitized, and we still have not gone through al l of 
the cassette tapes, but we started t o do so just only recently, and we came across one 

interview that was conducted in December 27
th
, 1974, in 
New York
, in the office of 
the American Jewish Joint Distribution Commit tee, and it is an interview with 

Margaret
 Feiler
,
 
the name who Œ who you wi ll recognize. She is the only adult 
chaperone who was on your transport. And the interview i s, all in all, it™s about 

three hours long, and Œ and she recounts everything that she did for the Jewish 

community. And at one point in t he intervi ew, she starts t o menti on an American 

committee for children, which arranged for ori ginally 30 children to be brought to 

the 
United States
, and then in the end, eight or nine children ended up being on the 

transport. 

A: O
h m y God.
 
Q2: And t hat is the ex Œ the excerpt  that we would like to pla y for you now. It™s 
about nine minutes long. 
[technical problem

ﬁM: –for a group of children, I t hink it was 30-odd children. There must be 

something on file on thi s. Probably not on this file, but she has the file. Children

whose fathers had died in some concentrat ion camp, either 
Buchenwald
 or 
Dachau
, and whose mother had a quota which didn™t come up; Hungarian or 

Romanian or Poli sh. Such children Œ they made a group of such chil dren, of 30-odd 

children, and they arranged for foster parents, here in the 
United Stat es
. The 
community intended to send, I think it was two social workers, who al so wanted to 
emigrate, who had the affidavits, sent them wi th the children to t he 
United States
. 
They all required f or vi sa around August  Œ September. And of the chi ldren, only 

nine got visas, for reasons which we never knew. And none of the two social 

workers got visa. And nobody else got visa, not in September. Not in August, not in 

September, I don™t know how far back, but not  in August, not in September, and not 

before I got  my visa. Now, I start ed talking 
to anybo 
Œ I 
[i ndecipherable]
 when I got 
the visa, they asked me whether I would t ake those nine chi ldren, and t hat™s what  I 
did. And that™s how 
JDC
 even paid for my fare, because I was the escort. They paid 
for those nine chil dren™s fare, and my own, and we came here. I w ent via 
Berlin
, 
where I picked up the 10
th
 child, that also wasn™t 
[indecipherable] 
and I brought 
them to the 
United Stat es
, via 
Lisbon
. It was t he first transport  via 
Li sbon
, through 
occupied 
France
 
[i ndecipherable]
. Now, to come back to the visa, I asked the 
people who had gone t o the consulate, tw o social workers, and everybody else to 

whom I could talk, because most of them came to the community in order to 

 
Interview with Herta Baitch

communicate to their relatives here that they couldn™t come because they didn™t get 
the vi Œ the visa. I asked them, what were you asked, because they were asked 

questions. And there was one thing that t hey all had in common, all of them. There 

must have been 20 people. They had been asked how they had voted in the last 

election, in the last free election that 
Austria
 had, which was some ti me in spri ng Œ 
I don™t know when it w as. The last thing Œ I asked that question, how Œ 
I: Is that before or Œ before Œ 

M: Before 
Hitler
.  
I: 1934?  

M: Right.  

I: There was not election Œ 

M: No, no, no, no, no, we had elections to Œ 
I: Was there election between ™34 and ™38? 
M: Oh yes, yes, there was. Was 
[i ndecipherabl e]
 But they have asked them Œ I can™t 

re Œ I can™t really tell you what year it was, because I know only t he question. But 

they asked, how di d you vote duri ng the last three elections? And all  of them, every 

one of them had said, either a soci al democrat or a Christian socialist. Well, there 

was no other part y. Very few said Christian socialist, but I know that the very few 

who had said that, and one had said social democrat. None of t hem had gotten a

visa. And the other questions, I didn™t find any other question that could be 
[indecipherable]
. So I started thi nking. And I was asked the same question. Wel l, I 

didn™t know what 
[indecipherable]
, but there was a so-called democratic 
[indecipherable]
 which I think 
[indecipherable]
 in all of Œ of 
Vienna
. Well, it w as a 
hopeless affair. It was somebody who really Œ I can™t Œ I can™t thi nk why anybody 
would spend money on something like that , but  it was idealism. Now don™t ask me 
whether I quor Œ voted for that, because I won™t admit anything. But when I was 

asked, that™s what  I said. And all I can tell  you is that I got the vi sa. 

I: 
[inaudi ble] 

M: That™s Œ that was my 
[indecipherable]
. So anyway, I got the vi sa, and when I 

came for the examinati on, you know, you had a medical examination, this is the 

second poi nt for t he American consulate 
[indecipherable]
 whatever you want to 
say, they asked me t wo questions. One sai d Œ one question was, what i s your true 
hair color Œ implying t hat it was dyed, w hich i t never was, and the second was, in 

what mont h are you 
[indecipherable]
 
I: It was w hat?  

M: In what  month 
are you 
[indeci pherable]
. T
hese were the two questions. So Œ I 
mean, you can imagine the atmosphere, this was the atmosphere. So anyway, I got 

the visa in October, I got the Œ I left on November 30
th
, I brought the children out.

There are some Œ I don™t think it™s here on file, and I don™t think I have it. I had 
written a column for that newspaper that the community 
[indecipherable]
 was 

called in those days, and I wrote about how I brought back the chi ldren, and it was 

very interesting for the people 
[inaudible]
. So that was t he story of, in those days, of 
the immigration
. Now,
 of course, this is what I know myself. Now one other thing. 
Murmelstein
 had over 
[indecipherable]
 was very anxious 
[indeci pherable]
 
but he 
also 
[indecipherable]
. And so the only hope was that a j ob offer would come from 
the 
United States
. And he was afraid Œ first of all, he didn™t want  to st ay. 

[indecipherable]
 to stay, but I was so opt imist ic, he didn™t  want t o stay. Number 

two, he was afrai d that the more he knew, and the more he was involved with the 

Gestapo, they may, in t he end, not let him go, not let him even survive. He was 

always afraid for his life. He said he™s gett ing deeper and deeper i nto this, and he is 
not going t o survive. So when I w ent to t he 
United States
, I promised 
[indecipherable]
 when I come here, that I would see Rabbi 
Yo ung
, and that I would 
talk to Rabbi 
Yo ung
, and ask him to get him a job offer as a rabbi. 
I: Who is Rabbi 
Yo ung
? 
M: Rabbi 
Yo ung  
is Œ has a Œ a community, a Œ a Œ a synagogue on t he west side. I 
can get you details from 
[indecipherable]
. He is of German extraction. He™s not  a 
refugee, but  he is Œ  when you talk to him, you can hear he is German. That the first

thing I did Œ I Œ 
I don™t know 
whether it w as the first week or the second week. But 
you see, as 
[indecipherable]
 in 
New Rochelle
 in jan Œ the end of January. So it 
must Œ all this was the end Œ the last few days in December, the fi rst t wo days in 
January. Before I did anything, I went to Rabbi 
Yo ung
. I was admitted to his study, 
and I start ed to talk, and he cut me short and he said, not a word about 
Mur
me
lstein
. Don™t mention 
the nameto me.
 I know all about him. I said, now, 
wait a minute. I™ve been working with him. Don™t tell me, I know all about it. There 
is not a thing I™m going to do, he should be happy his name isn™t mentioned in the 

United States
. And he practically threw me out, I mean i t™s Œ he Œ he Œ he was polite 

enough to say goodbye, but you know 
[indecipherable]
. So I wrote it. I wrote to 

Mur
me
lstein
 about it, and this w hat I want to tell you, because you see, I don™t 
know how 
Mur
me
lstein
 behaved in 
Theresienstadt
. I can imagine t hat all sorts of 
things happened. It could be, because the atmosphere in 
Theresienstadt 
was quite 

different from the atmosphere in 
Vienna
, and I don™t know what people do to 
survive 
[indecipherable]
. All sort s of thi ngs can have happened. But I do kno
w what 

happened when I was still in 
Vienna
, and I know that there was nothing that he did 
[indecipherable]
 because I was 
[i ndecipherable]
 all night. I went home to have a 

shower, you know, that was it. And nevert heless, that rumor had reached already

A: I did not know anyt hing, that I was even in the home. I didn™t remember that at 
all. I only remember going to the foster home with Mrs. 
Beazer
(ph), m y social 
worker. But when I read the transcript that I have, of her accepting us Œ it™s about a 

one and a half page transcript Œ seems like she was the ni ce lady t hat  I remember. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Because she was American, or Œ  
Q: And is there something that you learned from this tape, this intervi ew, thinking 
that again, t his took place over 40 years ago, this interview, in 1974. Is there 

something that you hear that it™s new, that is, something you weren™t aware of? 

A: She di Œ she only spoke very shortly about the children. 

Q: Yeah.

A: This is what I l earned from 
Stella
, that Œ that we were chosen, onl y nine 
children, and that somehow Rabbi 
Murmelstein
 said to the communit y, we™ve got 

to get these children out. 

Q: And was Rabbi 
Murmelstein
 t he head of the Viennese Jewish community? Was 

Œ 
A: As far as I know. There was a meeting of the Jewish community, and I Œ 
I™m 
only telling you this because 
Stella
 
told me.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: That he Œ they have to get the children out, if they can. 

Q: So he was involved in Œ in liberation. 

A: He was involved in that. 

Q: I see. I see. How did it Œ when you first heard that we had her voice on tape Œ 
A: I Œ I Œ I mean, she is such a Œ on the tri p, according to 
Stella
 Œ I hate, you know, 
I have to keep mentioni ng her name Œ 
she mentioned 
Margaret Feiler
 as such a 
very uncaring woman, who was really not with us very much. It seemed that the 
children were by themselves, and t hat the 15 Œ two 15 year olds sort of took upon 

themselves to take care of Œ of us, while we were en route. 

Q: Mm-hm. It™s i nteresting that Œ first of all, it ™s interesting, and i t™s not surprisi ng 

that people have different memories of a same event. Or, as in you have said over

and over again in your case, you don™t have a memory of it. And that Œ that how 
Margaret
 
Feiler
, 35 years after she brings these children over, is rememb
ering in 
her own mi nd what  are the things that were salient for her, as she™s telling the 

Ehrlichs
 about how she leaves 
Vienna
, how she answers a question t hat has 
nothing to do wit h anyt hing, you know, t hat is Œ deals wit h who did you vote for in 
the last free elections, you know. And why that would be significant. 
A: Is that what the y asked people, to get a visa? 

Q: That™s what she is sayi ng, that the social workers Œ 

A: Well, m y mother was not an Austrian citizen, so this Œ this would have been a 

moot point. 

Q: Yeah. I Œ I don™t  know, but it could be that she was referring to the people who 

were supposed to accompany the children. 
A: Yes, ma ybe so. Now, did she sa y there was more than one?  
Q: It made Œ it sounded like that, that others were supposed to co
me with more 
children, but that the y answered in the wrong way, and didn™t get  a vi sa. She is 

leaving it Œ  this is her supposition. 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: And she is leaving i t up to the 
Ehrlichs
 to make of it what they will. The people 
that she™s talking t o.

information from so many sources, and it™s not often that it Œ but it™s not rare either, 
where the y dovetail. And someti mes we™ll find something fro
m one person

the Œ coming from the

was very skinny. And they were just so nice to me, and the kids Œ I don™t remember 

the small children, but Œ but the five year old, 
Beverly

much she knew about me, or was told. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But it was a good first meeting. It was a wonderful first meeting, and Œ

A: Œ I sta yed in that home. I was put into second grade in a school not far from

copied these  big let Œ t hese large letters, that she Œ she saw m y handwriting, and she 
wanted me t o change the

foster home. What happened was that Mrs. 
Baer

another baby. She was pregnant, and she was rotund, and nobody knew that she was 
pregnant, not even her husband or her fami ly. I think she left a note i n a milk bottle, 

or something like t hat. But she went to 
Sinai 
Hospital, t o have a baby. 
Q: Oh m y. 

A: So that was her fourth child. And the Œ Mrs. 
Beazer
(ph) and the agenc y did not 

think it was appropriate for me to sta y in this home with the new baby, and that it 

was too much for Mrs. 
Baer
(ph).  
Q: It was quite a loss for you, though. 

A: It was very sudden, very sudden. And Œ and I Œ 
thank you 
Œ I went to a Œ

after some time, the agenc y Œ the associate d, used her as an interi m home for short 
periods of ti me for chil dren that were in Œ families were in trouble, or something

A: It was, i t was. 

Q: You know. What about the next family, who were the y?  

A: The next  family lived in a more affluent part of the city, and there were lawns 

and gardens and single houses. And Mrs.
 Baer

m y foster mother, she was in the garden, pulli ng weeds or somet hing. And, you 

know, I met her, and then my new foster si ster, 
Beverly
 Œ 
Q: Another 
Beverly
?  
A: Œ another 
Beverly
 Œ  came out, and I really felt like, for the first time, I looked 
like a refugee. I still had my high top shoes, and the clothes m-
m y m othersent with 
me. None of that had been replaced, and I had my braids. And they reall y looked at 

me as
 if  I was from out er space. She didn™t know what to make of me. First of all, 

she was not very prepared for Œ for me.

was a very fast exchange. And 
Beverly
 was two and a half years older than me
. But 
she didn™t look like a 11 or 12 year old. She Œ I was, by t hat time, eight and a half. 

She must have been about 11 and a half. She l ooked like a woman. She was 

completely developed, and she looked much older than her years. And she was not 
pleased. She was not pl eased that somebody was coming i nto the house, and 
certainly not me. 

Q: Was she a sibli ng Œ she Œ was she the only child? 
A: She was an only child, but she had been adopted by the 
Freilanders
(ph) from 

the associated Jewi sh charities when she was six months old. 

Q: Oh. 

A: So, I guess the Œ the organization knew about her, and I guess t hat they thought 
that it would be a good thing for 
Beverly
 to have a sister. I Œ I Œ I don™t know, and I 
never found out what motivated t hem to step forth. So, the next door neighbor came 
down, Mrs. 
Fine
(ph), m y 
Œ and Œ and her daughter 
Phyllis
. And the y thought I was 

adorable. B ut I didn™t get that i mpression from 
Beverly
. And for the first time, I felt 
like a stranger. It was a bad ti me for me, very bad time. Everybody seemed to thi nk 

I was so cute, but I didn™t feel that wa y at home.

and 
Beverly
 and I helped out in the grocery st ore. He was very soft spoken. He 
would come home and Œ and have dinner, and go be-behind his newspaper. And
 
Beverly
 and I Œ she had to make room for me in her drawers. We ha Œ slept in a 
single bed, because the bed hadn™t been del ivered yet Œ a second bed hadn™t 
delivered yet . So I reall y, really stepped on her. I really came in Œ I can™t i magine 

how she felt. I mean, how Œ how Œ how could I feel Œ how could she feel? 

Q: Well, how coul d Œ well, you know, in Œ in many different ways, that it was t he 

way 
Œ she felt the wa y she felt, and you were who you were. And it was, you know, 
too Œ 
A: It was very strange, it was Œ 
it was 
Œ seemed like it was so sudden. And there 
wasn™t even a place for me to sleep, we slept t ogether. We slept together in a single 
bed, and shared a room.

A: Sure it changed. I don™t th
ink that 
Œ we were so different. We were so different. 
Yeah, well, so-somehow we had t o make peace with each other, cause we shared a 

room all those years. I Œ I Œ I Œ looking back I can™t even envision how Œ how we 

managed, but we did. M Œ Aunt
 
Mary

Mary
 and 
Uncle 
Harry

m y long hair. And I mean, I looked, after a while, with new shoes and new clothes, 

I looked like anybody, and I did not have an accent, and I spoke perfect English, 
better than I do now. And so 
Beverly 
and I sort of made a Œ 
a peace. We were never 
like Œ we were never cl ose, but we had Œ you know, we Œ there were lots of times 

where 
Mary
 was very i ll and she was hospitali zed, that we had to t ake care of the 
house, and we did.

for the for Œ you know, for si Œ for the first time, because we were bot h al most

were very, very good 
friends. We werefre

Q: Mm-hm. You woul dn™t sa y sisters. 

A: I don™t think we reall y approached that subject. I don™t t hink we talked about t he 

old days, and how we felt about each other. We never did that. We tal ked about 

where we we re at at that time. And of course, 
Mary
 was very, very si ck by then.

to me, to tell me something about hi mself, or t o share something. But  he was very 
to hi mself. I really t hink he was fond of me, he just couldn™t Œ couldn™t share, he

Beverly

in a record store. And t hat™s when it cha Œ things changed between her and me. She 

wasn™t in school any more. She was making a small living for herself. She felt very, 

very much relieved. And I think sh Œ I thi nk our relationship got better at that time,
