then I went into
 the Congr ess , I  
went for the first time in
 1935 to Is ra el when I wa s...1935, I wa
s 29 year s old.  I we nt to Israel , but

enough to have people co

t think he coul d gi ve it  a speci fi c  
name .  Half of Zionism seems (ph)

Q: Di d your activiti es i nt ensi fy bet we en...a fter 1933

active well be
fore 1933, 
but  then, when Hitl er came
 to power , at t he  ti me  did you s ee t h at as  a  se mi nal e vent  at  the ti me?  
A:  I don't remember what I thought
 at the time.  But I was very ac
tive in the Jewi
sh community.  
The Jewish communit
y has been a assimilical (p
h) community with the ol
d people comi
ng to well-
to-do Je ws who are running it and 
a fte r that __________
__.  Many not- well-t o- do poor Je ws fr om 
the East came in as r e fugees fr om
 the Russian advance and they formed the majority finally of the 
Vie nnese Je ws and I wa s act
ive in the viacom (ph) in the fight, 
in the fi ght, for ge

this Jewish community.  
The Je wish communit y wa s some thi ng e n
tirely different than it is here or

anywhere .  By la w, incorpora tion 
to which every Jew belongs wh ether

to put , the y tax you.  I f you di dn't pa y your ta x 
to t he Je wis h communit y, 
the tax ____________ of  
the gover n ment t axe d your pr oper t y.
  They ha d ver y offici ous  tact
ics, this Jewish community. 
There wa s only one wa y to get out, 
to declare ousted (ph) of the 
______________; "I don't want to 
be a Je w a n y mor e ," and 
you we re not i n the Je wi
sh community.   So th
e Jewish community was 
really direct presentation of th
e Jews and I was very active for, 
for the Zi onist s, for Zionis ts who 
fi nall y got  the maj ority. 
Q:  Now when did you be
gin to, with the issue of
 emigration what was termed illegal emigration . 
How di d you arri ve at t hat  as  a so
l ution?   How did you come  t o t hat?  
A:  Wh en Hitler came to power 
in Germany, the refu gees come 
over fr om Germany to Vienna, 
mai nly well- to-do pe opl e , and the y
 were in Vienna and their child
re n s o meti mes had t he de sire t o

stronge st J e wis h orga ni zation i n Vie nna a nd 
you c oul dn't get  any number  of certi fic ates  
____________. You kn
ow emigration was very 
limited by ability and the 
people of the leftist 
orga niza tion, of the liber al group,
 they got most of the certificate

certi ficates. so one day I was in

A: No I did not consider mysel f 
alone .  We  ha d quite a posit ive  re
sponse.  But there were many who 
for pri ncipal  reasons were agai nst 
t he boyc ott.  I'l l  ne ver forget
 a meeting in Br

1935 or 1936.  And he s aid, " The Ge r ma ns are a g ainst the boycott bec ause they ______ up, thi s is
