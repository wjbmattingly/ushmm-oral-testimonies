Interview withArthur Menke 
February 28, 1992 
 
A: My name  isArthur R. Menke.  I was born 
in Hamburg, Germa ny, in the year 1927, February 
23
rd
.  
 

Q: Why don™t we start off by you telling me  a little bit 
about your childhood 
and your parents.  
 

A: I had a father whose age was at that time 55 
and my mother at that time was 46 and I had a 
sister at the age of 17. 
 

Q: You had one sister?  And 
that was the only sibling? 
 

A: Ye s. We  lived in a very nice neighborhood in
 Hamburg, Germany, and we had to leave that 
neighborhood and apartment we lived in because Je
ws were no longer allowed in that part of 
town.  It was too good for them. 
 

Q: What time fr ame are you talking about? 

 

A: That was, I would say, in about, ™38. 

 

Q: ™38? 

 

A: 1938. 
 
Q: Up until that time, I know this is going to be
 hard to try to reme mber, especially because you 
were that young, but do you reme mb er any of the 
time, around the time  that Hitler came  to 

power? 
 

A: Oh, yes.  Of course, I was born in ™27 but 
I vividly reme mber say around ™35 and that™s when 
the Jews were starting to suffer. And it was ma ybe around ™38 when the Jews, like I said, were 

resettled in another part of town and we were 
not allowed to shop in re
gular stores.  It was 
stores assigned especially to Jews with th
e me rchandise was higher. We  were also ________ 
benches which said ﬁno Jews allowedﬂ. You co
uldn™t go to a movie. And there were severe 

restrictions.  I™m sure you recall Cr
ystal Night, I don™t think we  have
 to get into that.  I™m sure 
you know that. When the German official was ki
lled in France and that was supposed to be a 
punishme nt to punish the Jews for 
that and that™s  how Crystal Night
 originated and at that time  
my father was taken to a concentration camp nea r  Berlin for six weeks. They came to the house 

to arrest my father and he was at the place of
 business and ordered my mot her not to contact 
him and they went and arrested him. And he 
came back after six weeks a broken ma n.  He was 
hardly recognizable. And at that time the N
azis had taken over all German owned businesses 
and they were governme nt run, so my father ™s
 business, he had a small factory producing 
rubber and signs, etc. and that business was ta
ken over by the government and his bank account 
was taken and we were only allowed to draw a 
small a mount of our own money at the time and 
my father was forced to work as a 
laborer packing shoe
s in a factory. 
 

Q: Do you remember when you were a small child, a
bout this time, was there a lot of anti-Semitic 

overtones, by the children, especially? 
 
A: Well, the anti-Semitism, it was a 
lot worse in smaller towns fi rst. 
 Small villages, as a matter of 
fact, it was so bad that the peopl
e who lived in smaller towns went
 to the bigger cities because 
there was less anti-Semitism.  Now, the German Je
w, if you want to use the term integrated, he  
was not like the Polish Jew who was discrimi na
ted by the Poles ma ny, ma ny years before the 
German Jew was. And so, the German Jew wa
s a proud German.  Like my father fought for 

Germany in 1914-18 and was discharged a proud 
German sol dier defending his country. And 
the German Jews were dumb enough to believ
e that what™s  happened to the Polish Jews, 
because the Polish Jews suffered sooner than th
e German Jews.  ﬁOh, this will never ha ppen to 
us.We  are German, first before we are Jewish.ﬂ
  But I recall being taken out of the school, I 
was enrolled in a German high school called ﬁT
almudTorahﬂ which is still standing today. 
 

Q: That was a public high school or a Jewish school? 

 

A: Jewish school.  And they also had a girl™s  sc
hool where my s i ster went.  It was a highlik a real 
fine school and we were well educated.  Of cour
se that was too good for the Jews again and the 
building was taken over by the Germans and we we
re all forced into asmall school with the 
girls.  Of course, there was a lo
t of immi gration at that time  
and my mother saw the handwriting 
on the wall and wanted to get out of Germany.
  But I recall saying to
 my father, ﬁ you don™t 
have a trade, it would be difficult to st art over agai n™ so they pr ocrastinated until it was too late.  

We  did try to leave Germany in th
e late ‚30™s but it was too late. 
 

Q: You said some thing earlier about being move
d within Hamburg. Wa s that a ghetto set up in 
Ha mburg? 
 
A: Not really.  It was a neighborhood wher
e more Jewish people lived already. 
 
Q: BeforetheNazis?  

 

A: Ye s. The neighborhood I lived in was on the ot
her side of the river which was a much nicer 
neighborhood. 
 

Q: And they moved you into 

 

A: Ye s. And I was not welcome at the school 
either, any more, I was going to a public school 
there. 
 

Q: Do you remember when you moved, what 
kind of feelings you had at that time? 
 

A: We ll, as a child, it didn™t bother us
 at all.  But of course, it was 
a terr ible thing for my parents to 
go through. As a ma tter of fact, we had a real nicehome at that part of town and at first we all 

lived, the whole family, in a rented room, you know
.  It was a trauma , at that time  already. 
 

Q: Let™s see, you talk 
a little bit about 
Kristallnacht, do you reme mber anything specific about that 
night that happened to you or your family? 
 

A: We ll, I know that all the Jewish businesses were totally destroyed including huge departme nt 
stores like Hecht Company.  Hashta is the name
 all over Germany today and they taken furs and 

threw them in the river and the people that ow
ned automobiles were destroyed. The strange 
part is that my father ™s business was not destro
yed because people didn™t realize that my father 
was a Jew.  So his business was not destroyed. 
 
Q: Is there any reason for that, th
at they mi ght not think that he 
was a Jew or did they just not 
know, is that 
 

A: They did not realize that he was a Jew and like 
I said earlier, the German Jew was first German.  
I want to tell you a little incident. There was a 
Nazi holiday and of course the Jews would not 
display their flag.  My sister and I would ma ke
 a flag out of a sheet and hang out which my 

parents naturally reeled back in again.  Just 
to give you a sample like there was no difference. 
 

Q: Do you remember much about any friends in
 school that you had at that time in the 
neighborhood, especially from the children if there were any anti-Semitic 
 

A: Ye s, because  they were agitated by their parents. 
We  had to wear a St ar of David with the name  
Jew written in and the letters were ma de in su
ch a way that they looked like Hebrew, said 
German Jew, and it had to be worn on the outer clothes. 
 

Q: From what time was this? 

 

A: That started also in the late ‚30™s.  I woul
d say ™38 and the kids would throw stones, you know 
kids are cruel and not being allowed to 
go ma ny places, was a hardship on the kids. 
 

Q: Do you remember what life was like, we™re
 not talking about a ghetto here but the 
neighborhood you moved to, was it guarded by the Nazis? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Wa s it free going back and forth? 

 

A: Yes it was. And even at that time there were 
plenty Germans who were 
not Nazis but they were 
scared not to be Nazis.  I reme mber as a little
 boy I worked in a little stor e they were selling 
health food and I took the 
deliveries for him.  Beau
tiful people.  But I also reme mber taking the 
packages to the post office, other kids would 
tear the labels off, you know, being Jewish, and 
causing problems  and things. 
 

Q: How did you work at this store? 

 

A: It was a little part-time job. After school I wo
rked there. There were Germans that my fa mily 
knew who befriended us who were st
rictly agai nst the syst em.  I™l
l tell you how bad it was.  One 
child rema rked in school he overheard his parent
s the night before saying that some  law that 
Hitler made was ridiculous or, I can™t get the detail; anyway this man, this Christian man, 

gentile ma n, was arrested by the 
German Gestapo and eight weeks la
ter his wife received an urn 
of ashes, they killed him.   So the kids were s
cared of their parents.  
You were not allowed to 
listen to foreign broadcasts, lik
e England andAmerica were separate, so neighbors would turn  
other neighbors in thatthey were listening to foreign broadcasts and they we re severely 

punished. You inquired of what type of 
neighborhood it was. We ll, it was not a bad 
neighborhood. The living quarters were difficult to
 find and we didn™t live
 as nice as we did 

before. We  didn™t starve.  It was just a differen
t type of living. We  were under pressure all the 
time like we were an enemy of your own country. A
nd like I said earlier, a 
lot of people started 
to deport, they had enough se
nse to get out of there. 
 
Q: Did a lot of people, were they able to ge
t out?  Wa s it more restricted as time went on? 
 

A: We ll, there was a point where H
itler wanted the people to get out
. Of course, they had to have 
visas in order to come  to this country. They 
had to be sponsored.  So that some ti me s created a 
problem. You had to have some one. They also
 had Jewish organizatio
ns, I think it was HIAS 
and others that assisted Jews 
from leaving. And then of course, you had to have a certain 
amount of money to leave and since my own ba
nk account, my father ™s bank account was taken 
over, at that time, it was almost
 impossible to leave so when we
 wanted to leave in the late 
‚™30™s, we couldn™t leave anymore.  My father want
ed to go toAustralia, that™s  what he hoped to 

do but it didn™t  work out. 
 

Q: You talked about freezing your bank accounts. We re you allowed an allowance, is that how it 
worked? 
 

A: To the best of my knowledge
, he was allowed a certain amount. 

 

Q: A certain amount a month or a week? 

 

A: Ye s, but it wa sn™t  enough so my father had to work. 

 

Q: You said before that there was no real 
hunger in this neighbor
hood that you were in? 
 
A: No, I don™t think so. There was food and ev
erything was available and there was food on the 
table. There was no real hardship like I said 
earlier, there was only certain stores where Jews 
could do their shopping. They were state operated. 
 
Q: All the stores they could go to or 
were certain stores with certain hours. 
 

A: Certain stores at certain hours. 
They were operated by the state. 
 

Q: Why don™t we move on here to your deportatio
n?  Te ll me  a little that.  How it happened. 
 

A: It happened you received a lett
er through the ma il. As a ma tte
r of fact, the postman knew of 
these letters and he normally would ring the door
bell when he had ma il for us.  He didn™t do it 

this time  because he was a decent guy. The conten
ts of the letter would give us an orde r to 
vacate our apartment within so many hours andwe were allowed so ma ny pounds per person to 

take with us and then we were told in that sa
me  letter that we had to take our own key to our 
apartment to take to the local police station.  I al
so want to add this that the gold and furs and 
other things, we had to turn in ea
rlier already, anything of value. 
 

Q: They seized your valuables. 

 

A: They seized.  Of course, some  people didn™t gi
ve it all up but there was a dr ive for that.  So 
when we received our notice, we bought warm 
socks.  I think we were allowed 100 pounds at 

fi rst . 

 
Q: What did you bring, do you reme mbe r? 

 

A: You know, a  backpack.  Sweaters, wa rm underwear, 
clothing, extra shoes. And we had to report 
to a Masonic temple.  Now I mi ght want to add 
that the Masonic temple was also agai nst the 
law to exist and my fa ther was a ma son 
and he went to secret meetings even. 
 

Q: Freemason? 

 

A: Ye s. And we went to this temple, which the 
inside was all ma rble and completely destroyed on 
the inside. And we laid on the floor for the night and the Germans ordered us any cash money 

we had to turn in, any rings and so on, they ma de 
a last  little pitch to ge
t the stuff off a nd that 
was the first time we we re guarded. We  were lo
aded on open trucks and taken to the railroad 
station and loaded into regular railroad
 cars, not cattle cars, railroad cars. 
 

Q: They had seats and everything? 

 

A: They had seats and everything in
 it. They were old cars, most 
had seats.  Some  had to lay on 
the floor. And we traveled I believe it wa
s three days and thr
ee nights to Russia. 
 

Q: Let me back track just a little 
bit. When the letter came, did th
ey give you any indication as to 
where you mi ght be going, what you mi ght be doing? 
 

A: I think we were told we 
were going to the east to work. 
 

Q: Okay, go ahead. 
 
A: Now, I ma y have me ntioned earlier that ma ny tran
sports that arrived in 
Minsk were killed right 
on the spot. 
 

Q: And that™s where you arrived, in Minsk? 

 

A: Ye s, Minsk, it wasWhite Russia, German occ
upational Russia.  Most people don™t understand 
that. 
 

Q: What time fr ame, what are we talking about, what year? 

 

A: 1940. 

 

Q: And that™s  when you were deported? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Okay, back to Minsk, sorry. 

 

 

A: In Minsk we were ma rched, it was very cold, 
we were ma rched into an area which was at one 
time a Russian school.  Now we wer e  a transport 
of a 1,000 people. That Russian school was at 
that time occupied by Russian Jews. And they had 
to vacate that building to put us into that 

building.  It appeared that at 
one time it was a fairly modern school.  It had running water. The 
faucets didn™t  work, the toilets didn™t work but
 you could tell it was a 
regular high school like 
we almost have in this country. And we alrea
dy saw a lot of dead peopl
e on the ground at this 
time, Russian Jews that were killed by the Ge
rmans that didn™t  evacuate the building fast 
enough. 
 
Q: They were in the building or around the grounds? 

 

A: They were in the building.  It was part of a ghetto then. 

 

Q: And this was in the wintertime , right? 

 

A: It was in the wintertime. And we then gather
ed old ma ttresses and stuff and we stayed in that 
building and there was another build
ing, other small out buildings a
nd that™s  where we stayed at 
the time. 
 

Q: Did you go out and work from there, is that what you did? 

 

A: The first couple of days I don™t think we did but 
then we were put to work. As a ma tter of fact, 
we had to build our own fences to go around there.
