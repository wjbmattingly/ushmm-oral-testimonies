Dezube
 i s the daughter of

 and 
Norbert -- Norman Salsitz, 
Holo caust survivors who have
 been interviewed for the 
United States 
Holocaust 
Memo rial Museum™s oral history collec

 and
 To by  Herr
 for making this interview possible. Oh, be quiet. 
This is tape number one, side
 A. 
We are off to a good start he
re. So as I said, there is 
a dog with us in the room, but I think if we
 put her outside, it wo
uld be even  lo uder, 
so hopefully our listeners will understand and 
even enjoy at times. 
My first -- my first 
question is, give us your full name, 
and wh en  and wh ere you were born. 
Answer: My full name is 
Esther CyliaSalsitz Dezube
, and I was born in 
Newark, 
New Jersey
 at 
Beth Israel
 Hospital. 
Q: Were you named after someone who 
has been murdered 
during the war? 
A: Yes. 
Q: What does that mean to
 you, and what do you know 
about these people? Can you 
bring them to life a little bit?

A: Well, it™s hard to bring them to life, b
ecause I really never met th em. But my first 
name is 
Esther, 
which is my father™s mother™s 
name. And I don™t know a lot about 
her. I know a lot more abou
t my father, and how he su
rvived the war, but not so 
much about the personality of
 the mother, or the father, for that matter. My middle 
name is 
Cylia
. That™s after my mother™s sister 
Cylia
. I know a little bit about her. I 
know all the good qualities about her, and my
 mother seemed to adore her. I don™t 
know a lot about her otherwise. And that™s 
it. I actually -- my  kids are named after 
survivors as well. And we did one other th
ing for our children. All their names equal 
18, all the letters. They have 18 letters in
 their names. And 18 is a very special 
number in th e Jewish religion, because it means 
chai
, it means life. So we try to 
continue that on. 
Q: Okay , we™ll talk about your children a 
little bit later. I would like to now go back 
to you as a very small child, an
d to see the first me mo ries of stories, of bits of stories 
that you now know were re
lated to the Holocaust. 
A: I -- I can™t tell you the age, because it wa
s always there. My -- and you can tell a 
little bit when they started, because I could 
see when they started with my older son. 

My bedtime stories were probably Holo ca
ust stories. My father would sing me 
Yiddish songs, I remember that
. My mother didn™t read to
 me at night, my -- it was 
my father™s -- not job, but that™s what he 
liked to do. It -- it just didn™t start, it was 
always there, they always 
talked about the Holocaust. Their friends were always

Holocaust survivors, they di
dn't in tegrate into the Amer
ican society. So that was 
always the topic of conversation, 
I can™t tell you when it started. 
Q: Let™s -- i-if you can -- I mean, I know it™
s really difficult, and especially if it 
started very early, to remember, b u t are ther
e bits of stories that you remember that 
came up at what occasions, how 
did they talk about it? Is 
there anything that sort of 
comes to mind, that gives an impression of 
what it was. So their father sang to you, 
what -- what -- what else? 
A: Oh, he would tell me the -- I mean, that™s
 what he would tell me, he would tell me 
about 
Hitler
, and -- and -- and children being kille
d in the war. I think he learned 
actually to temp er his stories as he 
got older. He would tell me , you know, the 
children™s fats were made into soap. He 
wo uld tell me that -- you know, his -- his n-
nieces and nephews were killed and they were
 my age. He would say that -- it would 
even start with food. I was a 
very fat child, and th
ey were very proud of it. They were 
proud that I was fat because
 they had enough fo
od to give me and children were 
starving in the Holo caust. That
 I remember v ery distinctly, I was not allowed to leave 
the table without finishing all the food, beca
use the children in th
e Holocaust were s -
- would starve, and I should appreciate all that. 
Q: They would say that? 
A: Abso lutely. Abso lutely.

Q: How did -- how did -- how 
did you feel, I mean what was your reaction? How 
young were you, roughly, that -- I mean, wh
en the father told you
, for instance, about 
the -- 
A: I could be three. I mean, I was very 
young when they woul
d s -- tell me th ese 
stories. You know, I just remember the stories were always there.
 How, you know, he 
lived in the woods. My mother did not tell me stories. 
M y  mother didn™t tell me very 
much at all. It was alw ays my father™s st
ories, how he surv ived , and how they  met, 
and how all the kids were killed. Not my 
mother. My mother would cry. She would -- 
she would start to tell me these stories, and 
then she would cry, and I didn't want her 
to cry so I™d always change the subject. I 
mean, I never let her tell the stories, but -- 
Q: Did -- did your father make them into
 stories for children? How -- how do -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- you remember th em? 

A: No, they were not made for stories for 
children. They were as gruesome as he 
could reme mb er them. He would tell me  -- 
he didn™t go th rough th e concen tration 
camps, so he didn™t tell me those kind of st
ories. He told me how his father was 
killed in front of him, how his sisters 
were killed. I knew the story about my 
grandfather, I can™t tell you what age I -- 
I knew that he tried to -- my mother™s 
father, how he escaped, and how he tried to
 come back and find 
her. I -- I can™t tell 
you when these started , but I-I always had these stories.

Q: Do you remember how you
 felt when you -- when you 
heard that? I mean, w a -- 
was it -- was it a -- was it fear, distance, cu
riosity, wha -- how did it make you feel? 
What was your response to -- 
A: Well, you™ve got to unde
rstand something, is that one
, I was an only child, so I 
had no one to bounce it off ex
cept my  parents. Again, 
my parents really only 
associated with Holocaust su
rvivors. I didn't know another world. It was the only 
world that I had. I was not a giggly kid. I 
never was a giggly kid. The kids used to 
play with -- I ne -- I didn™t play with dolls
 very much. I played
 with maybe trolls, 
later on in life. Make-believe was very ha
rd fo r me, because I guess I had a taste of 
reality -- harsh reality first. I wa -- I drew a lot. 
Q: What di -- 
A: I drew animals. I drew animals. I could 
relate to animals better th an I could relate 
to people. I know that. I always drew an imals. I have actually even difficulty, 

probably , drawing people. Again, how did I 
know it affected me? 
Only because later 
on. When  you™re growing up and it -- you re
ally don™t know how it affects you. I just 

thought this was the way in -- 
in that regard how everybod
y was. It affected me in 
other ways that I didn™t have a family. It
 affected me that, 
you know, I saw my  
friends with grandparents and stuff like th
at. But the actual stories? I never heard 

Winnie the Pooh
. I never heard any of these, 
Snow White.
 I didn't know. 
Q: Did you have friends as -- as a y
oung -- as a younger child? Did you --

A: I didn™t have a lot. I had some friends. 
I had -- I had some girlfriends, but not a lot, 
because in a sense, al
most like my older one, I was a li
ttle -- I call my youngest kid a 
little old man, and I pr
obably was a little old woman. I ju
st couldn™t relate to them. I 
couldn™t understand the -- the sparkling dre
sses and the fancy hair and clothes. My 
parents weren™t into that, she never took 
me to malls. She never did any of these 
things, so I didn™t. Did I rese
nt it? Only a little,
 when I was older I resented it, not 
when  I was young.  
Q: Did you make -- did you make a connection 
to those stories that were told and to 
the songs sung, to
 your parents? When
 -- wh en did that ha
ppen? I mean, did it -- 
were they s-sort of difficult to deal with stories 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, you gotta understand that they were 
never told  to me as stories. I didn™t have 
to take a fairy tale and try to then say oh,
 I™m going to transfer this fairy tale to 
something th at happened in r
eal life. These were presented 
as real life stories, that 
really happened to them. So I knew it wa
s my parents. I knew it -- that everything 
belonged to them, that I was part of that history. And th ey kept telling me I was part 
of that history. That I shou
ld be a good Jew, I guess, because I am a -- because I was 
born, it was their fight against 
Hitler
. I mean, I had to maintain that. That is 
something th at I was brought up
 constantly. And I do tell my 
kids that, a -- a little bit, 
is that because I sur -- I -- I 
was b o rn, and I survived a Je
w, and I maintain it that I 
am victory over 
Hitler
. So this was something that
 I grew up, all the time.

Q: That™s a heavy -- pretty 
heavy burden, potentially, for a 
smaller child to feel that 
much -- 
A: Probably  was. 
Q: -- responsibility. 
A: I left the house at 16 and a half. I 
just turned 17 wh en I left the house. 
Q: Let™s -- let™s -- let™s -- I would like to so
rt of stay there just
 for a little bit before 
we -- we move onto that. Gi-Giv
e me a sense, a little clo ser sense of what was family 
life like, th e s -- the so cial occasio n . How 
did you experience th
-the home? And did 
you make comp arisons to other homes that
 you saw, when  you visited friends, for 

instance? Was -- I mean, you said that was a -- 
sort of the normality, that you feel -- 
that™s what you thought it was. Di d you ha
ve comp arisons to other homes, or -- gi-
give us a little better sense of what it was like 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, you gotta understand, everybody 
has a dysfunctional family as far as I™m 
concerned, there is no perfect
 home. I mean, you watch on 
TV,
 that™s where you 
make your comp arisons. 
And you always wanted to
 be like the family on 
TV,
 not so 
much like your friend™s fa
mily, but the family on 
TV. 
Cause they always complained 
about their parents, too. I didn™t have a close home life. My mo ther -- I was closer to 
my  mo th er th an  my  fa
ther, only cause my father wasn™t
 home. My father is a very 
driven  man. Probably is why he survived . Bu
t also, he was an immigrant in a country  
and he had to prove himself. 
So he would get up at 10 o™
clock in the morning, which

means I™m already in school. He would co
me back from me etings at 10 o™clock at 
night, and when  I was young I was already in
 bed. He loved to listen to Yiddish mo  -- 
music, which is not something that I liked
. And on the weekends
 they would go a lot 
with their friends. I was a tagalong only 
because they didn™t ha
ve a babysitter, and 
they would speak Po lish, wh ich is a language 
that I never learned. So  I had to  create 
my  own world. I mean, I used to have dinn
er with my mother. 
Sh e™d u -- have the -- 
she loves the radio. So either she had mu sic or news in the background. And she™s 
very political oriented. And so she would 
always talk all about all the political 
situations and I had to always
 be a-abreast about it. And th
at would be our pul -- our -
- our life. My parents didn™t really integr
ate with me. Maybe it™s part of the inte -- 
European culture. But we
 didn™t do -- we went on vaca
tions. We™d travel a lot. We 
didn™t do a lot as a family, not that I can 
recall. My mother, agai
n, she wouldn™t take 
me shopping. Sh e laughs at me when I sa
y that. Oh well, you know, I took you on 
these trips instead of shopping. We didn™
t do the normal family stuff. My mother 
liked to read, and that™s what she did. I don ™t recall us ever engaging in board  games. 
I don™t ever a -- we nev -- it was as if they 
were tired of life. And I couldn™t relate. I 
mean, again, that™s also fantasy. You 
know, board games and playing with a little 
kid. And they didn™t know
 how to deal with it.  
Q: When I interviewed your parents, and 
especially your father though, there was 
such a -- you called him a driven man? 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
9
A: Yes. 
Q: There wa -- there seemed 
to be, when he talked to 
me, a great life spark in him 
though, at the same time. Tired of life, a
nd at the same  time very -- seemingly had 
life -- 

A: He™s very driven. 

Q: It -- it -- try to ex -- to try to -- for 
listeners who haven™t 
heard -- who haven™t 
heard the interview with your parents, and 
from your perspective as
 a -- as a younger 
person, because maybe that has changed over
 the years, how did you see your mother 
and how did you see your father in  the ear
lier years? How -- how were they to you? 
How did you see them as persons? 
A: My mother was reality, my father was fa
ntasy. My mother is not a ha -- in my 
perception is not a happy woma
n. In a sense kind of bitte
r, but down to earth. I was 
never showered with co mp
liments. She may disagree with me, but that™s my 
perception. I -- I always liked to draw and sh
e always felt that that was beneath her as 
an occupation. I was accepted to art school
, she was very angry. She said, as a 
vocation, not a -- as an  
advocation
, not vocation. Sh e wanted me to be a docto r, it 
was it, black and wh ite, you™re a doctor or yo
u™re -- or you™re a failure. She called me 
a failure when I was in college. 
Q: Do you know why -- 

A: Yeah, oh -- 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
10
Q: -- it was so important for her to -- that you become a doctor? 
A: -- yes, and sh e explained that to me. She 
said that a doctor -- and again, this is her 
perception because she was a survivor. A doc
tor can take their skills and go from one 
country to another and start again. And if
 I wasn™t a doctor I wouldn™t have those 
transferable skills. And that™s
 why it was so i mportant, even though math was never a 
strong point. And it was just not a subject 
that I excelled in. I was always on the 
debating team, I was o n  the speech team. It 
was very interesting, I mean, when I was 
young, that™s where I lean. 
And you know, yet I agreed to be a pre-med student the 
freshman year of college. And then I realized
 it -- I loved taking care of people, but I 

couldn™t get through the chemistry  and the -- 
the physics and the trigonometry to get 
there. I mean, if it was just lab work, I got 
A™s
 in biology lab work and stuff. So 
that™s the freshman year of
 college she called me a fa
ilure. But wh en you have no 
other siblings, y-you have to achieve all th
e goals that your pare
nt want. And th at™s 
what they wanted. I me
an, they didn™t see me as almo st
 a person, but an ex tension of 
all their goals. I can see that now. Ma
ybe when I was younger I resented it. 
Q: Maybe, or did -- what -- what -- how 
did you feel when -- 
ho-how did you feel 
about yourself at that time, and how did y
ou -- did -- did you ha
ve anger? Did you 
have -- 

A: I had -- 

Q: -- comp assion, did you have -- 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
11
A: No, I didn™t have co mp assion when  I wa
s younger, I have mu ch  mo re comp assion 
now. Confusion, I think was the better idea.
 I knew enough -- it wasn™t anger. It™s one 
of the reasons I left home, because I didn™t wa
nt to have anger, I didn™t want to have 
resentment, and I knew that distance would 
take care of that. They tried to totally 
dictate -- my mother, not my 
father -- cause she just was around more -- dictate my 
life. In a sense I had -- she had to reliv
e her childhood, her concept of a normal 
childhood th rough me. If I had boyfriends sh
e would write a script what to say to 
these boyfriends. Sh e would go through th
eir mail to me, you 
know, judging them 
either fit or unfit. But yet, 
you know, she did give me free
dom. I -- I dated early. So -
- but I-I could see that she was more contro
lling in a way to give
 herself control over 
life. She needed control so that she could 
feel control, because the war didn™t -- not 
let her have control. 
Q: How about your father
? He was fantasy, so -- 

A: He was fantasy. My mo ther didn™t yell 
and scream a lot, but she would keep a 
grudge. She would keep it in her. My fathe
r, you can ju st spark him and he™ll scream 
and rant, but on the mo st part, it™s done 
and over with , you know
? And you want to 
hide sometimes. I remember going into it -- 
he would -- he would pick fights, even 
when there were fights not even there. We™d
 go to a store and he wo uld pick a fight 
with a salesman, or if he didn™t like some
thing a woman said, he
 would pick a fight. 
But it would be done. It would fester with
 my  mo ther. We had a neighbor who was 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

12
German, and they would always have fights,
 always have fights. My father would 
take him to court, or they would -- scream
ing at each other. But the odd thing is that 
his oldest daughter was my babysitter. So
 it was an interes
ting relationship. 
Q: About the other family, did y
ou get to meet his older brother, 
Leibush
, do you 
reme mb er h i m? 
A: No, no, there was a feud in my family. 
Okay, I don™t know th
e feud very well. The 
feud started, I heard, when I was born. From 
one of my  cousins, a first cousin, I heard 
that my father would -- and my father still is
 a very gener
ous and giving man. And he 
was probably very generous and giving to
 them. And when I was born -- cause they 
had waited 10 years for me and they were go
ing to  adopt, I guess they realized that 
the fortune, or whatever my
 father had amassed wasn™t going to go to them, and it 
was going to go to me. This is what I was 
told. And th ere were conflicts and jealousy 
because my father made it in 
life and the brothers really di
dn™t. So I didn
't meet them, 
at all. I mean, I never met 
Leibush
 at all. I met -- I met 
David
, oh, maybe a couple 
years before his death. 
Al 
I met only once. When  I was very small he gave me a book 
by 
Edgar Allen Poe
. Why I remember this I don™t even know. But -- and he was 
very tall, and I don™t really have
 any other memo ries of him.  
Q: So you never really had an
y kind of relationship to the 
New York 
part of -- of 
your fa -- I mean, to the -- to the -- 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
13
A: To the brothers, no, no. Ab solutely no relationship whatsoever. There was a 
cousin named 
Benny
, who was my first cousin, who -- maybe when I got married, 
came to my  father and said, I™m n o t -- I™m not 
my father™s son, I want to start having 
a relationship back with you. And we beca
me very friendly with him, and I liked 

him, and -- but they  moved to 
North Caro lina
 and distance has its, you know, way 
of cutting into family ties, so I don™t see hi
m any more. But I have good memories of 
him later o n  in life. My father has a first cousin name -- a nephew named 
Eddie
, who 
I have not a re -- really a relationship with 
at all, but he is friendly to my  parents. 
Q: What about your mo the
r™s part of the family? 
A: They were close. They -- 
I -- I -- there was a cousin 
Leo
, who -- my parents never 
made a Passover, which is -- I don™t know if 
you want me to explain it, but it -- it -- 
Passover is the time when the Israelites left 
Egypt, 
and they lived in the desert. And 
the actual name started  when God -- after the 10
th
 -- or the last plague, God said to 
put lamb ™s blood on the door of the Isra
elites, and then  he would pass over their 
house, and we should retell the sto ry in -- in
 the -- we call it the Bible, we don™t have 
a fir -- a first testament and a second test
ament. Old Testament and New Testament, 
excuse me. But your equivalent of -- of the 
Old Testament, it™s in there, and it says, 
you shall remember. S o  that is an very
 big holiday an-and it™s a unique holid ay 
because it™s family oriented in the home. 
You don™t go to temple, necessarily, for 
Passover. So my cousin 
Leo
 would always make it, even as a small kid I would go to 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

his house. There was a cousin named 
Harold Anglestone
, who is much older, but I 
heard he made the wedding fo r my  parent
s. We didn™t cup -- keep  up with his 
children, but I do recall him. I am friendly with 
Leo™s 
children, and 
Leo 
has a twin 
sister, and I™m friendly with their childre
n. No t extremely close, but definitely 
friendly with them, they™re come -- we go to
 each other™s family occasions. But I was 
always considered the outside -- I always 
felt like the outsider, ev
en when  I went to 
these occasions.  
Q: Why? Or in what way? 
A: Maybe I was al -- I wasn™t so much you nger, but I -- I ca -- it™s like they would 

talk and I would always be in
 a separate group. I was always considered the outsider. 
Once I asked them, when I grew up. They sa
id, your mo th er always said you were 
perfect, and that you, you know, you were 
always the best and the greatest. And so 
we really didn™t want to have anything to 
do with you. And I said, well that™s nice for 
me to know, but I don™t really
 perceive myself as that.  
Q: Why did your parents not 
want to celebrate Passover? 
A: Oh, they wanted to celebra
te it, they just never actua
lly -- oh no, they wanted to 
celebrate it, but just -- they 
didn™t do it at our house, be
cause it would only be three 
of us. We always went to their house 
because he knew how to do it and it was a 
family situ ation. My father had on
ly one cousin that was here in 
America
 that we 
were friendly with, that I have memori
es of, and that is -- he™s a rabbi, 
Shapiro
 and

his wife, 
Martha
. They always tried to include, but 
they were much 
more religious -- 
always tried to include us. So I rememb er going there to 
Sukko t
 and some other 
holid ays. Bu t I always 
felt like an intruder.  
Q: Because you couldn™t -- also because you -- 
A: They had many ch ildren, it 
was like there was their family and here I was, alone. 

So you felt it like an intruder. It
 was just a different world. 
Q: The -- your -- your -- your mo ther also has family in 
Israel
? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did you go often? What
 kind of relationship di
d you have with  them? 
A: My mother had a good relationship w
ith her sister, and still does. In it -- 
Q: That™s -- that™s the older sister? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The younger sister was killed, whom I 
was named after. We -- we™d go every two 
years when I was young, to 
Israel. 
Was a big trip. I rememb er once going on a 
propeller for like 36 hours to 
Israel
. Then we would go on 
a cruise boat, cause I 
couldn™t take planes very well when I was young. It was a big deal, but I was mu ch 
younger than her children, they were 10 ye
ars older than me. So I was always, again 
alone. And they would talk Polish. The ki
ds would have nothing to  do with me, 
because I was so much younger, and I was in my own world.

Q: What did you do in that own wo rld? Wh at was it like? 
A: I turned to art. It was 
my solace. I drew all of th
e time. And I was never alone 
when I did that. 
Q: You never actually had an im
als though, at that time? 
A: Yeah -- no, we had a dog. Bu t my  mo th
er™s -- you know, my  concept of the dog is 
right now I™m sitting on a bed an d the dog is 
next to me. And my mother™s concept is 
the dog stays downstairs. Only
 once did th e dog -- was allo
wed to go upstairs and she 
shredded one of my animals -- h e, actually -- because I went to camp . And that was 

like my favorite animal. He knew which on
e it was and shredded it. So it was a 
different kind of relationship 
with animals. I was -- my fa
ther loves animals and he 
would pick up all these strays
. And once we had three or 
four dogs at one time. My 
mo ther was not too happy. I would pick up 
stray birds, we had stray rabbits that I 

would pick up, and I would take
 care of the animals, too. I always had animals. Part 
of -- my husband laughs that when we go
t married, you know, the condition was that 
we had dogs. That was it, we™re going to ha
ve dogs, when we could, and we did. But 
-- so art, an d -- and dogs. I used to read
, also, but not as mu
ch as my mother. 
Q: What did you read? 
A: Animal books and science fiction. I read
 the classics, but they were okay. I still 
read. I don™t like -- my mother 
likes to read really heavy 
books and I don™t. I like to 
escape in my books.

Q: She said she likes to read a lo
t but she doesn™t like non-fiction. 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: No, she doesn ™t like fiction, only non-fiction. 
A: Only non-fiction, yes, right, exactly, and I 
read fiction. I™m tired
 at the end of the 
day and I like to escape. And I think th at™s a sense of just 
[indecipherable]
 with us, 
because she can™t understand where I™m coming 
from. That™s part of being a child of 
the Holocaust. Since I grew up in 
America
, still acquired a lot of the American ways, 
and she can™t understand th em. She can™t under
stand why I want to read fiction, why 
I don™t want to have to -- 
why don™t I -- I have my ears
 co nstantly up, listening for 
things that might affect me. And I have my 
ears up, but not the same way. My mo ther 
is hyper about it. And I want to be -- I want
 to have a -- a -- a semi-normal life. But I

A: You know, I was just thi
nking about wh en you were saying my  father was very 
dynamic, it™s his way of escape. You know,
 he tells all these stories, but they™re 
mostly in the past, and they™re
 not the present. He has so
me, but they™re mostly -- he 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

dwells totally in the past because he f
eels comfortable there, and it™s his way to 
escape. If you lo ck yourself in 
these stories, if you™re co
nstantly telling the stories, 
it™s like an actor. If he™s in a role
, he doesn™t feel his own pain. 
Q: Your mother said to me in her inter 
-- did you ever listen to their tapes, by the 
way? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You did. She said that your father is 
a ham with other people, and at home he™s 
very quiet -- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- very silent, so that would fit into it -- what -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- what you just said. You said you left
 home very early. Tell 
me mo re ab ou t th at, 
the decision to do that, and wh ere did you go? 

A: I actually didn™t make that decision. To 
this day I have no idea how it came about, 
but it appears when I was in high school, I was put in a program, it was an 

accelerated program that I only had three year
s of high school, and I went to summer 
school one summer, and then I 
went to college early. I don™
t know who put me in that 
program, I have really abso
lutely no id ea. I wouldn™t reco
mmend it, to be honest, to 
anyone. But I -- I thin
k they basically said that I wa
s too mature to stay in high 
school and I just didn't fit in, which is an in
teresting way, I suppose, to put it. And so  

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

I went to co llege early, and I didn™t apply 
home. My mother recognized that we were 
starting to fight, I mean, I was hitting puberty.
 If I -- if I lived -- college at 16, then 
you know, puberty star
ts 14 - 15. I wa -- I was one, in the throes of it, but I don™t 
know if my mother really 
knew how to deal with it. On
e, children weren™t supposed 
to talk against -- back to their parents, we
ren't supposedto argue
 with their parents, 
they were supposed to be
 little mannequins. My moth
er always told me how 
wonderful she was. My mother would tell 
me how -- a good student she was. My 
mother always said how she listened to herparents, and I was not like that. So I guess 
what she was doing is trying to  avoid, on
e a fight, and dealing with puberty. And I 
left home and I only came back one summer,
 first summer. Becau
se after college 
they tried to put me, I reme
mb er, on a 10 o™clock tur -- curfe
w, and they didn't want 
me to grow up. They  wanted me to go 
away, but not to grow up. And th at was 
difficult. And I think it wa
s difficult for them, too. 
Q: Explain that a little bit mo
re, they wanted you to go 
away, but not to grow up? 
A: Right. Because if I grew up, I came bi
 -- my own person, which is not exactly, 

one, the way they saw me, or two, the way 
they could control me. They -- they -- a -- 
they -- every time we went into  a room, the fi
rst thing they would do is talk about the 
Holocaust to my friends. First thing. And 
they would tell the stories. I mean, it was 
just everywhere. My first dates, my first 
frien ds, the first thing 
they came into the 
house, they would always -- they would tell 
the stories. And my  friends were scared. 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000

They just didn™t want to hear them all the 
time. So one, it limited your friendship, but 
two, wh en i -- you know, they 
were offended that my  friends
 didn™t want to hear it. 
What kind of person are you if
 your friends don™t want to 
hear it? They were afraid 
because it was a test, also, whether or not
 I would keep Judais
m. And you know, I 
was away from home. What would I do? You 
know, I -- I -- I -- I dated people who 
were non-Jewish, but honest I could say 
that I would never marry anybody who was 
not Jewish. It was too mu ch integrated in part of my  life. 
Q: So what did that mean to  you then, to be -- you were 
so trained to be Jewish, in 
certain ways, it was -- no, it -- wrong, it 
was so important -- the emphasis was very 
[indecipherable] 
what does -- 
A: It wasn™t religious emphasis. 
Q: -- that™s -- what 
[indecipherable]
 at that time -- 
A: Yes. My parents did not light candles
 when I was home. They had ham in the 
house. They still have ham in the house. They  still have a -- a -- kielbasa and all these 
Polish delicacies. It was a heritage. That™s 
what it meant to them
. They eat bread on 
Passover. I -- I -- I -- I didn™t go to a Jewish
 day school. I went to Hebrew school. I 
was not really 
Bat Mitzvahed
. I had a party in 
Israel
, but I never went through the 
formal training of a 
Bat Mitzvah
 in th -- in the 
United States
, to this day. They had 
to -- and it was difficult for them, to be re
ligious, with what th
ey went through. I 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
21
don™t know if they hated God, but they 
were resentful. But they still wanted a 
connection to heritage, and that 
they instilled in me very well. 
Q: Did that become different for you, 
though, the religious aspect? Do you -- 
A: I am actually more religious than my
 parents. We -- do you
 want t -- I mean, I 
never had a -- a 
sukkah 
when I grew up. It™s
 like a little hut that 
you put together and 
for seven days you stay in it, and it™s a harv
est festival. We have one. Every year we 
put it together, the kids, we have a dinner, 
we have a -- friends who come over. I™m 
not 
Sho mer Shava s
, which means that I don™t -- I ride on 
Sha bbat
, and go places on 
shab -- on Saturday. Bu t on Friday night all the kids 
get together and we have our 
Friday night dinner. To the point that my  s
on works as a waiter and told them that he 
will not work on Friday night
 because he has to be home
 for the Friday night dinner. 
We celebrate the holidays, I change my  dishes on Passover, we get rid of all the 

bread, I change the dishes, and we keep it 
-- actually, that™s kind of an interesting 
story, because the year that I decided to ch
ange the dishes, I had to look for plates. 
And I went into this store and th ere were 
a set of plates that 
had Egyptian pyramids 
on it, and had the slaves. And I thought that
 was almo st like, you know, God™s telling 
me something. I bought those dishes, and 
they don™t make th
em any more. They 
discontinued them after the y
ear I bought them. And we still have them. So that way 

I™m muchmore religious
. My  kids go to a Jewish day school. Part of it is heritage. A 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
22
lot of it is heritage, to be honest. But I™m
 a lot more religious because I™m not as 
angry with God as they are.  
Q: It™s -- it™s all right to ju
mp back and fort
h a little bit -- 
A: I don™t have a 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: -- when things come up. I would lik
e to keep some kind of chronology -- 
A: Okay . 

Q: -- so let™s go back to, so
 you never really fit in. 
A: No, I never fit in.  

Q: How did you fit into college life? So 
we are now -- you are now wh at, 17? Wh ere 

did you go? 
A: I went to 
Bo sto n  
Un iversity, and my  freshman year I probably , using the 
vernacular, blew it. I didn™t do very well in
 school. I remember I was in a pre-med 
program because my parents wanted me in 
-- to be in a pre-med program. I was a 
goody tw o shoes, basically when  I grew up
, in high school. I never cut. I never did 
anything really wrong. My mo ther didn™t
 like my  clothes and she would constantly 
tell me how I was inappropriately dre
ssed. But I didn™t do anything really 
majorly
 
wrong. I was in the only kid in  driv er™s ed  when the teacher would say, drive faster. 

And here I was in college. I still, I neve
r smoked -- I-I smoked once, cigarettes, when 
I was in law school. I didn™t smoke, didn™t
 drink, didn™t take drugs, never took 
marijuana to this day. I didn™t have a ne
ed to. But my -- blew 
my grades. I really 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
23
blew my  grades. I wanted to have a social life and they  don™t mix. And th e math was 
difficult and I didn't probably put an effort 
in it -- to it, b u t there was another aspect 
to it. I didn™t want to go in -- I -- I realiz
ed that medicine wasn™t for me. If I did well, 
I would have to continue. So I got a 
D 
in chemistry. Not that it was difficult, but I 
did. Can™t go to  med school with a
 D
. My parents -- that™s 
when she called me a 
failure, and I switched. She didn™t sol -- I 
don™t think my  mo ther
 spoke to me for a 
couple of months. My father did. It was 
very interesting, my father later on became 
mu ch mo re supportive of wh at I did. 

Q: Wh-Why do you think that is? 

A: Cause he was probably a very  rebellious
 r -- youth, and you know, he really -- a 
little bit of himself was shin
ing through through me, and I don™t know whe -- he 
probably  smiled and was outraged at the same time.  

Q: It™s kind of interesting, I didn™t want 
to interrupt you, but I 
did bring th e interview 
with your mother and when I asked he
r in the very beginning how she would 
describe herself before the war, she said this, 
Amalie Petranker 
was very happy go 
lucky child with shiny eyes
. She couldn™t carry for a long time a grudge or hatred. 
She loved people, but she was also a fight
er, because she was a middle child. So she 
learned to fight for her rights. She was 
a little mischievous, she was rebellious, she 
questioned her parent™s judgment. 
Did you ever meet that person? 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
24
A: No. I didn™t meet that person. Parts of it I™ve met. M y  mother questions a lot of 
people, you know, and -- and th
eir positions on life. No, I can™t see my mother as a 
rebellious person. Maybe she was happy go
 lucky, but you know, she was mu ch 
older wh en I was born. I didn
't see that real happy go 
lu cky person. Sh e may have 
been when she first got marri
ed, but they had a love/hate 
-- they still have a love/hate 
relationship. They came from very different
 worlds. And they™re at each other™s 
throat for that, even in the 
way they speak Polish. My mo
ther will correct my father, 
totally. No, you don™t say it this
 way, you don™t say it that 
way. My  father had a sixth 
grade education. He did well,
 and he was very  proud, an
d he ca -- he hid his report 
cards in the war because he was very proud, 
but he only went to 
the sixth grade and it 
had nothing to do with his ab
ility, it had to do with that wa
s the fact of life, he was 
the youngest child of nine and he had to 
go work. My mo
ther was educated woman, 
very proud of her educ
ation. And she would let my  mo  
-- father know that she was a 
very educated wo man, and he was not. That
 would have a problem. My father had a 
girlfriend named
 Rozia
, who he could never let go. And 
I heard that they really never 
dated very  mu ch, but he was -- she was pr
obably  his fantasy of what would have 
been. And he let -- he always -- 
he talks more about, sometimes,
 Rozia
 than my 
mother. So that hurts. 

Q: Let™s go back to your freshman year
 that you blew. What -- what happened 
afterwards? So you did get a 
[indecipherable]
 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
25
A: I switched majors to political science a
nd teaching. And I love
d it. And I -- and -- 
and I have a teaching degree as
 well. I did my student teaching in -- in -- in high 
school government, which was very interest
ing cause I had the sweathogs. And I had 
a great teaching supervisor. And I brought my
 father in, talked a
bout the war to these 
people, and about guns and violence. And th at
 was one of the few days that they were 
silent. Was -- it was -- it was very good. Be
sides they made the bu lly of the class the 
leader. He was in charge. Cause maybe they
 wouldn™t pay attention to me, but they 
weren™t going to  cross the bully . 
Q: Did you see your father di
fferent in that situation? 
A: He loves people. Yeah, he shone -- he -- 
he was shining. He -- he was animate, he 
was full of life. It™s an odd way to put it, bu
t I think he almost enjoys telling the tales. 
Again, I think it gives him a sense of purp ose. But sometimes he gets choked up, he 

got choked up at my  wedding, he got choked
 up when  he blessed my  -- my  older son 
at his 
Bar Mitzvah
, but he usually doesn™t get choked up. So , yeah, he liked it. I 
think maybe he liked the idea that I though
t of him, to ask him to come and -- and -- 
and speak. Maybe it was an acknowledgeme
nt that, you know, I never turned  my  
back on the Holocaust, but I 
don™t live it day in and day out like that. And I know 
that hurts them. I do. But I didn™t forg
et it. It™s still part of who I am. 
Q: How did the students respond to him? 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
26
A: They were silent. They gave him 
an amazing amount of
 respect. Probably 
admiration that he -- he survived and he was 
a soldier and that he made it, and oh, he 
fought the Germans, or the N
azis. So they respected him,
 cause a lot of these kids 
were street kids, and they ha
ve a re -- respect of the pe
ck ing order. And he was, you 
know, lieutenant governor of 
Kraków
, and that was pe -- you know, prestigious 
position. And I hope they walk
ed away from that with so
me knowledge. We also did 
a trial where -- we did a rape trial and I ma
de the boys the victim, and had the wo men 
of the class on the jury and the judge. I reve
rsed entire roles. And that was interesting 
because I™m very attuned to victims. 
Q: You just -- you ju st said that, I was -- I 
was just thinking, did that -- do you think 
that you brought a different perspective tothat profession? I mean, not to stereotype 

it, but to bring so mewhat different experience
s, and perspectives to that, because of -- 
A: That incident? 

Q: No, because of yo
ur own experience -- 
A: Abso lutely. 

Q: 
[indecipherable]
 came from -- 
A: Oh, absolutely. It™s pr obably the field -- why I ch
ose this -- bec -- became a 
lawyer. Absolutely, I bring my perspectiv
e of the victim, I was always for the 
underdog. Even when I wa
s in high school, they were -- they were called 
inedgibles, 
the mentally retarded childre
n in the class, an d you know, they were segregated. Not

so much now, but -- I us
ed to be the one to 
help them, lead them around, or take care 
of them, or be assigned to them. Cause I 
understood what the un
derdog was, because 
I never put myself as saying that I was goi
ng through the Holo caus
t, but I wa -- could 
always associate myself still close to my pa
rents that it could happen to me, and th at I 
had to protect other people because of that. Th
at™s very strong, I try to make sure that 
my  kids are survivors, so that if ever 
it should happen to  them, that they could 
survive. But I -- and I make them very attune
d to that -- or I try, and also very proud 
of who they are, and respect others. Very  important to me. Bu
t I still keep food 
downstairs, a little extra food, 
in case something sh ould 
happen, my husband laughs 
every snowstorm, you know, 
why you stock up like for 
years? And he doesn™t 
understand. I mean, I can explain it to him,
 but he doesn ™t understand. Just this 
mentality that if anything s
hould happen, I am prepared. 
Q: We™ll talk a little bit more about that too,
 I just want to one more time go back and 
just ask you -- 
A: High school. 
Q: -- when you go -- well, I sort of -- 

A: I mean college. 
Q: -- well, basically, eve -- even a little 
earlier, di -- when you look back, did the 
Holocaust feature in schoolbook
s at that time ? Did you -- 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
28
A: In -- only in hi -- only in Hebrew school
, but no, not in the pub
lic school, this just 
not spoken. I was probably looked at as 
a very odd person that my parents were 
survivors. 
Q: Did th ey know of -- di-did 
you talk about that at school? 
A: I personally, I talk probab
ly more about it now than I 
did when I grew up, but no. 
But my parents always talked about it, I 
didn™t have to, you 
know? And it™s also -- 
and if you have an accent, somebody™s gonna go, wh ere are you from? Even to my  

parents, it™s the first thing out of th
eir mouth. And they ™ll say, I™m from 
Poland
, and 
my father jokes, I™m from, you know, the south -- south 
Poland
. 
[indecipherable]
 a 
little -- and they™ll -- he™ll say then they™re
 survivors. So it comes out very, very 
quickly, where they™re from. I went 
back during my  co llege years to 
Poland.
 I went 
with my mother on a trip. And th
at was an interesting experience. 
Q: Because you wanted to go, 
or because she wanted to go? 
A: She wanted to go. Well, 
she wanted to go because 
there was a man who helped 
save her life, his name  was 
Mundek
, and I -- he was very ill at the time. And my 
mother said that he was always in love
 with her. He never married. He™d saved 12 
girls. And sh e wanted  me to meet him. An
d so my  sophomore year of college I went 
to 
Poland
, and at that time you couldn™t go as a Jewish group to 
Poland
. Didn™t 
exist. You had to go with a Roman 
Catholic group, led by a priest to 
Poland
. And 
that™s how we went, and that™s -- it was very
 interesting because I never told them in 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
29
the group that I was Jewish. I mean, I neve
r brought it up. My mother didn 't bring it 
up either. She basically said, you know, le
t us blend in right now. And I reme mb er 
the priest took a liking to me, and he always
 tried to make me go to confession to all 
these different church es. And I kind of 
bowed out. And we had one week that we 
were spending with our friends, with the pe
ople that helped save
 my father, and the 
people who helped save my mother. But while we were in
 the tour group, there was 
also a -- a g roup, they were the fir -- th
ere was a group of first Christians or 
something like that, they were from 
Ohio
, and they don™t cro
ss themselves e it h er, 
and they  don™t go into confession. So I ki
nd of said I -- I can™t do that, or whatever. 
And he had no clue that I was Jewish, no
ne. And there was a woman there who right 
away everybody kn
ew she was Je wish. She al
so had a -- she was from 
Auschwitz,
 so 
she had the symbol. But even 
befo re, they kind of knew. 
They used to tell Jewish 
jokes on the bus, and they still made 
fun of Jews. Hardly any Jews in 
Poland
 at the 
time and they still made fun of us. And I -- 
and I knew then how 
my mother felt. I 
used to wear a 
Moses
 holding th e 10 co mmandments. I wore it on the inside. It was 
very interesting. Then we spent a week with 
the families. And I met 
Mundek
, but we 
couldn™t talk to each other. But he was if -- 
th ere was like a light in his eyes. He was 
a very interesting, very nice man. But I spen
t -- we stayed at the 
house that -- of the 
woman who saved my father, 
because she had a house in 
Wa rsa w
. And she had two 
children my  age. We couldn't speak very well,
 but they all kind of -- if they knew that 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
30
I was Jewish, it was just never brought up
. Ho locaust was never brought up, never 
discussed it. There was a language barri
er. But there was one boy who came over 
who did bring it up. And -- and we liked eac
h other. And I said to him, by the way, 
do you know that I was Jewish? I had to
 tell him, I don™t know, it™s -- something 
compelled me that I h ad to tell him who I wa
s. And he said to me, we™re all children 
of 
Mo ses
. But he was the only one of the group 
who went to the university. So it was 
very different, but I felt very strange ther
e. You know, you would o -- go with  other 
pe -- I would not -- I mean, he knew I was 
Jewish. And of course, I thought the other 
children knew because of what their parents 
told them. But it™s ju
st not -- I was told 
in some parties not to bring it up. And then
 we went, you know, to see my father™s 
house. And I felt -- then I felt anger, becau
se I couldn™t -- here was my father™s 
house, that didn™t belong to  him any mo re, 
that was taken from him, and I wanted to 
go up to these people and say,
 this is my  heritage. My mo ther told  me, you know, 
obviously, not to do that, 
not to bring it up, not even to  mention we went to a 
restaurant to have tea. 
No one questioned my  mo the
r, whether she was Jewish, no 
one thought about it, and I guess I don™t look
 that Jewish. It was not imprinted across 
my forehead. But at the end of the trip wa
s the most interesting part because I sat 
next to th e priest on one of the planes. And I showed -- he said, where do you go to 
school, and I said I went to 
BU, 
and on my  
I.D.
 was the Jewish star.  And he looked at 
that, and you could see his eyes were wide
ning, and he turned around, and he said,

ﬁThat -- that looks like a Jewish star.ﬂ I said
, ﬁIt is.ﬂ He said, ﬁAre you Jewish?ﬂ And 
I said, ﬁI am.ﬂ And he said, ﬁWell, I lik
e you anyway.ﬂ And I think to him, he 
thought he was giving me a comp liment. 
But, you know, there are two ways to 
approach those kind of people, yell a
nd screaming, butt your head s, not get 
anywhere. Shake your head, 
and be polite. Show them th
at you can be better than 
they. And then other ways, press your point. 
And I -- and I think that™s the way that I 
usually do it. 
Q: When  was that
 trip, roughly?  
A: ™75. 1975. 
Q: Have you ever gone back? 
A: Since ™75? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: No, I went to 
Auschwit z
 then, too. The trip was -- th
at was also very strange. We 
went to 
Auschwitz
, but again remember, we went wi
th  a Catholic group. And now 
they have tours and say Jews died there. Wh
en we went there, they didn't tell us Jews 

died there. The official tour was that ma
ny people died  there, period. Not one wo rd 
that Jews died there. But you could see th
at -- the fingernails 
in the wall -- in the 
cement walls. You can see imbedded lines th
at match fingernails in -- in the gas 
chambers. And you just have a chill. I mean
, you know, there™s just a silence an d a 

chill. And that™s -- you know, 
you realize that it will never 
hap -- you™re not going to 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

let it happen again. But that™s something fo r the perspective, versus dwelling on the 
past. 

Q: What was your mo th er™s response to that
 -- da -- ha -- and wh at -- what was your 
relationship to each other at that time? 

A: We were close. That was probably one 
trip that we were quite close. I probably 
was not a very warm child. My mother wasn
™t that warm either, I mean, she would 
hold my  hand, and -- and stuff like that, and I 
didn't want her to hold my hand cause I 
thought that was not the right thing to do
, you know, women holding hands together. 
But she would never co me a
nd hug and cuddle and kiss me. And I in turn  was not a 
huggy, cu ddly person either. 
I™m much more with
 my children. But we were close. I 
think that we did hold hands then. It was 
almost like the world 
against us, except for 
these people that we stayed 
with. It tends to bind you.  
Q: Did past become a little concreter in
 some ways then, be
cause so much -- I 
imagine 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, I saw all the pictures, my parents 
would always show them to me. So they 
became affirmed, but not concrete -- any mo
re concrete, because I think they were 
already concrete. You know, if you™re in
 a ca -- you can see pictures of the gas 

chamber, and be in a gas chamber, and it™s a 
very, very different feeling, but they 
were always in my memories. I -- I reme
mb er once -- this was past college, but I 
remember once we were with
 these young people, and ag
ain my  parents bring the

Holo caust up right away. This woman steppe
d on a bug, and got upset cause she was 
a vegetarian, and -- and my mother said, well
, that™s how they used to crush children 
in the Holocaust. You know, 
there was a moment of sile
nce after that, what do you 
do? It™s a very awkward pause. But that™s
 -- and -- and they never saw that it would 

be an awkward pause cause they had to 
keep telling. You know, some don™t tell, 
some don™t let go. And I think I had one of each. 

Q: I think that™s probably a good place again 
to switch the tapes. So this is the end of 
tape one, side

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with 
Esther Dezube
. This is tape number two, side
 A. 
And I promised, in a sense, I 
wouldn™t go back  to your ch ildhood, but 
I would like to ask you one mo re question. 
Did your parents ever -- how did th ey re
spond to sort of th
e trivial childhood 
problems that you must have had? The littleproblems that loom incredibly large. Did 
that have any meaning? Could th
ey relate to that at all? 
A: No, they couldn™t relate to it at a
ll. They had no patie
nce for it whatsoever. 
Basically they looked at me 
as -- they wanted to ig-ignor
e that it even existed. You 
know, I was studying th at the Pilgrims used to
 dress up th eir children in adult clothes, 
because they didn™t realize ch
ildren were children, didn 't  
want them to be children, 
but to be miniature adults. And I think that™s
 what they  wanted me to be, a miniature 
adult. I mean, they -- I think 
my father took pride in -- in
 that I was a little girl, but 
no, I don™t think they  could deal with th
e trivial problems of growing up very mu ch. 
It -- because, to them, they always compared 
it to the war, and it was so trivial to the 
war that how could you even  be bothered, 
you know, by acne, or how could you be 
bothered with the fact that 
you™re heavy, until later on, finally I went on a diet, 
because I wanted to. And they still tried to
 push food on me. I 
mean, how could you, 
you know, be bothered by thes
e things, kin -- in comp arison to  wh at happened  to  us 
during th e war?

Q: Do you recall mo ments of 
casualness, of --  was --  
A: When  we went on trips. Yeah, when  we 
traveled to different 
countries. My mother 
didn't  like to travel a -- my 
mother liked to travel as 
much, but she didn™t like to go 
around as much. Once we got 
to the countries, she™s pe
rfectly happy reading in a 
hotel room. And my  father I would explore.
 That was the time that my father and I 
really got to know each 
other. I remember in 
Paris
 my  mo th er stay
ed in the hotel 
room, we went to the art colo
ny, we went all around. But when we traveled, as if we 
were removed from the daily pressures of everyday life, that there was much more 
casualness. When we went on 
cruises, much more casual. 
Q: I would just like to move the microp
hone just a little bit, so one second. 
[indecipherable]
 get a little closer. Okay. And ther
e™s one more question about the 
family in 
Israel
. So it was really difficult, we -- we talked about that. But -- but still, 

was it important for you to meet, at least a la
rger -- to have a sense of a larger family 
there in flesh and blood if you will, was 
that important sinc
e you didn™t have 
grandmothers, grandfathers in -- in 
New York
? Did that give you a different feeling 
of relatedness in terms of family? 

A: To be honest, no. It was important that there was a state of 
Israel
. It was -- it was 
important that I had a place to go. It was im
p o rtant that it existed and it thrived. But I 
was so used to being alone, and accepting of
 it, and they were so far away. So you 
gotta understand is, if I was going to rely
 on the fact that I had family in 
Israel
, I

would be miserable every holiday, because th
ey weren™t with me during the holidays. 
They weren't with me, I couldn™t call them 
up and say, let™s do something. They  were 
very far away. So, it was nice to know 
that I had family -- it™s the lizard. 
Q: So we are just hearing a lizard here in an
 aquarium, but -- just as an explanation of 
the sounds we™re hearing. 
A: So i-it -- it was a co mfort level, but it wasn™t like, oh, I had family, because it 

didn™t play into my  everyday 
life. I -- I -- family is very 
important to me. I -- it may 
sound like a -- a strange, opposite approach  
to it, but it™s extremely  important to me. 
And it was comforting that they were there, but not that it was a bigger picture and 
that I had some family . I tried to instill that
 in my children, it™s one of the very  strong 
things I try and instill in them. 

Q: Well, let™s talk about not your childre
n yet, because you need  to meet -- 
A: We™re not there yet, yes. 

Q: -- your husband first, or at l
east somebody you love, I guess, first. 
A: Well, husband I knew since 14. 

Q: That™s -- let-let™s talk about him. 
How did you meet, what did you like ab out, 
what -- what -- how did he become important to you? 
A: One, I believe that my mother had this
 all prearranged in many respects. But I me t 
him at 14, we -- he belong
ed to  a youth group called 
USY, 
United Synagogue Youth, 
and I belo nged to th at youth group. I wa
s active in the Jewish movement, I was -- 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

was president of that group, of my  chap
ter. And we met at a dance, a friendship 
dance, and we were supposed to give each 
other keys. I went wi
th another boy, he 
went with  another girl. Yet, he gave me 
the key. And I didn™t date him after that, 
either. We were just good friends for ma
ny, many years. I knew his girlfriends, he 
knew my boyfriends. We had a lot in comm
on. We™re not very similar in personality, 
but we had common ground. 
Q: Like what? 
A: Judai -- he came from a family was not relig
ious. He is, I think, fourth  generation, 
on one side, American. 
Israel
 was very important to him, it was important to me. 
Judaism was important to him, it was impor
tant to me. Stability
. I crave stability. 
And he was a very stable pers
on. Regretfully, he isn™t emo
tional at all, or romantic, 
or nothing, he™s just not. Maybe if I was 
-- hindsight is hindsight, but he is a very 
stable person. He™s a kind person. And he
 got along with my  parents, my  parents 
liked him. He would listen to their stories. 
And he used to like to fix things and my  
father liked to fix things, so 
that he fit in our family. I don™
t have an  easy family to fit 
into. So that was a positive sign. Has it 
develop -- it develope
d when I came back 
from 
Poland
, and I -- I went to 
Israel
 for a winter vacation, 
and he had taken a year 
in 
Israel
. So we met there, and I still was not the apple of his eye, his bicycle was. 
He toured  
Israel
 all over with his bicycle, and went through 
Europe 
all over with 
this bicycle. He was more in
terested in the condition of hi
s bicycle than I. But when 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
38
he came back, it was a very hard  decision 
for both of us, because we were always 
good friends, and once you go pa
st good friends, into a different kind of relationship, 
you can™t go back. So we had to decide wh
ether we were willing to risk it. We were 
both very young. And -- and my
 parents pushed us into marriage, I™m positive. Cause 
we -- I got married three weeks after I gra
duated c-college. I didn™t plan my  wedding, 
my  mo ther planned my wedding. I didn™t ev
en get to pick my  dress. She kind of 
picked my dress, and I wanted to change 
it, and sh e kept saying no, no, so I think I 
changed it a little bit. I think 
I picked the colors
, that™s about it. 
I walked into the 
wedding and everything was done. We were
 young, I was 20 years old when  I got 
married. And we grew together. And I must 
admit, he™s much more stable and I™m 
much more volatile. I mean, yo
u know, a lot of times I™d  say, I can™t take this any 
more, you know, go away fromme. And he™ll be the one say, no, we gotta work this 

out, calm me down. But we had that bond of 
Judaism, and of our heritage, wh ich was 
a very strong bond. He wanted a ki
 -- he wanted the kids to go to 
Schecter. 
It™s very 
important to him. He still 
goes to Israeli book clubs.  

Q: What about wanting kids, was th
at important to both of you? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: For you? 
A: Yes. I wanted kids and I did not want 
an  only child. That was very important to 
me. You know, we had discussed that. The 
kids, the dog, and a house with wh ite 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
39
bricks, he keeps joking. And that™s why he 
tells me I always get my  way. Kids were 
very important to both of us. Continuatio
n of our heritage. I basically raised the 
children. He™ll concede to that, I think, 
because he™s gone a lot. He does a lot of 
research, he used to do a lot of moonligh
ting, mo re -- only this year he stopped the 
moonlighting. He wanted children so badly th
at I had just finished law school -- we 
were married still when we were in grad 
school together. He was -- I was up here, I 
brought him up here, I liked 
Boston.
 I didn™t want to return to 
New Jersey
, I felt 
there was nothing th ere. Except my  parents 
there was nothing th ere. So I -- I went to 
law school, he went to 
Harvard 
graduate school. Then I -- then he went to med 
school. And I took the bar, and I w -- said
, we™re not moving. But when he was an 
intern, he wanted a ch ild. I don™t know why, 
he wanted a child very badly. And I kept 
saying lo ok, you™re not going to  be around. 
But he really wanted
 a child, I conceded. 
We had a child. And he was gone all the time,
 so I have a very close relationship with 
my  older son, who has a difficult relati
onship with my  husband. But it was very 
important for us to keep up Judaism. He™s
 very proud of my  pa
rents. He can handle 
them very well. Sometim
es better than I can. 
Q: He can handle them well,
 or he relates to them? 
A: Both. I don™t know if he relates to them
, but he can definitely handle them very 
well. He™s willing to listen. Sometimes I get irritated 
because I™ve heard it so many 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
40
times. But he has that kind of
 patience. But he™ll -- he™ll lis
ten to them. He™ll let them 
vent. I let them vent now, too. But I think in th at way it™s a good match. 
Q: Was it difficult for you to de
velop, sort of to give in if you will, or to -- to be 
intimate with somebody ? I mean, because it se
ems to me that -- 
A: Because I was always alone?  

Q: Yeah. There was a -- there seemed to be so few -- 

A: I don™t know if I still give up all of 
my self. I don™t, I know 
that. My mother said 
she had a difficult -- she had some difficult ti
mes with her father. And I think part of 
that is also influencing me 
i-in -- you know, if 
you don™t give all of yourself to one 
person, you can™t get all wit -- all that hurt. So
 I know that™s part of it here. I™m much 
more of a romantic, he™s not, so I resent it. 
B u t no, in the beginning, it wa -- it wasn™t 
hard, because I was seeking it. I wanted 
somebody to care about me. My parents had 
-- care about me a lot, but in a different way. And I wanted a family. So  that was 

really important, and he wanted that, so 
it wasn™t that hard. I™m a strong willed 
person, but I do give in a lo
t. I don™t argue as much. 
Bruce
 says I -- I win all the 
arguments, I don™t think that™s all that true
. If there™s -- if the bot
h of us are in the 
room, 
Bruce
 will talk a lot more than I do. I d
on™t talk on the telephone that much. I 
don™t enjoy it much mo -- and that™s part of
 being alone idea. I need my  time alone at 
night. He laughs, you know. He goes to be
d very early cause he gets up very early, 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
41
cause he™s a physician. But I need that tim
e from like 11 to 12:30 at night, and I™m 
alone. 

Q: You became a trial lawyer -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- too? So  that you have also a very 
intense, talkative j
ob in a -- in a way. 
A: Yes. 

Q: I mean, you talk yourself out
 during the day, in a sense 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I do, I talk myself out during the day, 
I™m always on the phon
e, I™m always with 
the 
[indecipherable]
. I make -- I became a -- that 
was definitely related to the 
Holo caust, and actually I think my  husband™
s vocation is related to the Holo caust, 
too. 

Q: What is he? 

A: He™s an 
AIDS 
oncologist. And I know th at he chose to  go into  
AIDS
 wh en  it 
wasn™t popular. I don™t know if it™s still po
pular, but he had to fight a lot of battles. 
Why in the world would a stra
ight person want to deal with these type of people? 
And that™s basically what they
 used to say. And he said 
that the hol -- that the Jews 
were viewed  that way too, and if we don™
t stand up fo r these people, who would sta -
- who stood up fo r the Jews? We have to st
and up for these people so that doesn ™t 
happen ag ain. And that™s why he went into
 that field. And I™ve had to write many 
letters to the hospitals that tried to ta
ke his -- his room away, and all sorts of 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
42
interesting dynamics. But he fo ught on and he wrote 
[indecipherable]
, and he do -- 
he loves his field. Does research and sees 
patients too, at the same time. And I went 
into plaintiff law. I never in my life c
onsidered being defense, ever. Because the 
plaintiff was always the underdog. I never 
considered -- there™s man y  different areas 
of trial law, corporate law, or my father wa
nted me to be a real estate lawyer. Just 
wasn™t for me cause it didn™t involve dea
ling with people, and protecting victim™s 

rights. That was important to me that I protect them against -- and I -- and I view  the 
insurance co mp anies as people who -- or co
mp anies who take ad vantage of people. 
And I wouldn™t let that happen to  me, it w
ould go against my  grain. So when  I try a 
case, a little 
[indecipherable]
 of that is in me. It makes 
it easier when you try a case 
that way. I won™t take cases that I feel th
-the people aren™t tr
ying -- you know, telling 
the truth. I -- I -- I -- I really make it a point 
that I want to be respected in my field. I 
can™t be a top trial lawyer, because I have 
children and you have choices in life to 
make. And I made the choice that my  fam
ily does come first. And I™m not unhappy 
with that choice. 

Q: When  you th ought about parenting, be
fore you had them, or just when you -- 
when  you just had the -- your oldest son, wh
at was sort of the -- was there some kind 
of plan, quote unquote, did you want to 
do something different from what you had 
experienced, did you ha
ve your own dreams ?  
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
43
Q: What -- what would you -- what
 was sort of the game plan 
[indecipherable]
 
A: If you find th e parent™s manual, please 
show it to me, cause I have never read it 
yet. There were qualities of my parents that 
I wanted to continue and there were a lot 
of qualities that I didn™t want to continue. 
I didn't want to be as judgmental, though I 
mu st admit I™m judgmental on th ings, but I 
don™t think I™m as judgmental across the 
board as they are. I didn™t want to live in the past, and I wanted to give them space. 

What I wanted to continue is their love of
 Ju daism,  love of family. My parents would 
probably  do anything for me, and give me 
things. They™v e done a lo t financially and 

spiritually for me. I want my
 kids -- I want to do th at 
for my children. In a sense 
that™s a little bit of an argum
ent with my husband, too. 
He™s more let them tough it 
out and I™m not. But I suppose that was part of
 the game plan, to create a heritage in a 
family.  

Q: Did it work? 

A: I don™t know yet. 
Q: It™s a w o rk in progress. 
A: You know -- you know it wo rks only wh en 
they have a family, because right now 
they™re under my roof. So it™s very hard to see what they™re
 going to take with them. 
I see a little bit more of that 
now with my older son, beca
use he™s almost 18, but it™s 
hard to tell with my younger
 two. I remember though, co
ntrol issue, when I™d given 
birth to my  oldest son, I wa
s 27 and my  mo ther called me and said I was too young to 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
44
raise my  child, she was going to  take him aw
ay. I think that was the only time I hung 
up th e phone on Mo ther. You 
know, my husband se -- ke
eps saying, what -- what 
goes in one ear can go out the other ear. I™m tr
ying to apply that a lot more as I g et 
older. 
Q: Do you think she was 
serious about -- I mean 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Oh yeah, she was quite serious. She didn'
t act on it, but I -- at the moment I think 
she was quite serious about it. I walked my
 child, it was March, in the stroller, you 
know. I didn't keep him in a playpen. I was obviously -- you know, you don™t know 

until you have kids that, oh, my parents kept
 me always in a playpen. And she would 
get angry at me that I didn™t do those things. I held them too mu ch , I cuddled them 
too mu ch , I spoiled them too mu ch. A
nd I didn™t believe in those things. 
Q: Though she craved it so 
mu ch herself, when she came to this country  and didn™t 
find any of that, that was so strong 
in her interview. That she talked -- 
A: That™s right. 

Q: -- again and ag ain, I do not -- I did not fi
nd the love and the warmth that I wanted. 
So -- 
A: And so you build a wall.
 You have a choice, you can have a nerv ous breakdown 
and crack, or you build self defense to 
those things and go on
. And that™s what 
happened . And also, I guess, the 
Euro pean 
way is -- is that again, kids probably 
were in playpens, and that™s how she wa
s brought -- she was brought up she had a 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

45
maid, so I had a maid til I wa
s three. She didn™t -- I mean, 
she would take pride in the 
fact that sh e used to bathe me. M y  father us
ed to read to me, my 
mother used to bathe 
me and the rest of the time I was with th
e nanny until I was thre
e, because she would 
teach, or whatever, but you kno
w, it wasn™t that si -- cl
ose. I mean, now, you know, 
people realize how much the bonding is im
portant. I mean, people didn™t know th at 
then. But I -- I didn™t -- I did not have an 
au pair
 until I had a third child. I had 
always somebody come in and help me, but I 
-- I still to this day 
don™t work full time, 
I work part time, so that I™m
 the one who runs around when  
they have the 
plays in the 
schools and the docto rs 
appointments and -- and all that. I do that. My 
au pair
 
doesn ™t do th at. Never did. 
Q: Describe your three sons a little b
it to me, and also you mentioned in the 
beginning th e names, so you chose to name them after -- 
A: Yes. 
Dustin
, now we have English 
and Hebrew names too.
 
So
 Dustin™s 
is -- is -- I 
mean, you say 
Dustin™s
 not a very Jewish name. It
™s a G erman name, it means 
victorious, or -- going back, but his name is 
D u stin Isaac,
 and he his Hebrew name is 
David Itzh ak, 
or 
David Isaac. David
 was a -- after my mother™s father, and 
Isaac
 
was after my father™s father. You know, 
that was one thing I must say for my 
husband is, I mean, obviously he had a family 
too. And he didn™t object that I named 

them after my side of the fa
mily. He kind of understood th
at it was important to keep 
their names alive. And I credit him for that
. And 18 is somethi
ng they do in their 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
46
family. And I felt it was just a wonderful idea
, so that I incorporated  it, some of -- 
like the spelling of 
Isaac
 is a little off, but it™s 18. 
Aa ro n
 
Richard,
 and th en his 
Hebrew name is 
Aaron Raphael
. 
Aaron
 is after his grandfather, but even my  
parents liked his gran dfather, and I don™t th -- 
and he had just died, 
so it actually fit in 
very well, but 
Raphael 
is -- is after 
Rachel, 
my father™s sister. 
Richard. 
And 
Michael -- 
actually we had a little problem with 
Michael™s 
n ame, my  mo th er wan ted  
Frederick, 
and I just couldn™t see naming my child 
Frederick
.  Now, we thought 
even 
Forest
, they told me they woul
dn™t even call him by name if he -- his name was 
Forest.
 They call my son, by
 the way, instead of 
Dustin, Do dso n
, on purpose cause 
they didn™t like 
the name. But so 
Michael 
was actually my idea 
cause my father has a 
sister na me d 
Ma lch i a
, and 
Fried
 is 
Frieda, 
but it™s spelled a little different. And his 
Hebrew name is 
Simcha Meloch, 
which is actually -- the translatio n is happy king. 
And that was their Hebrew names. So it™s 
interesting in school they dwell a lot on 
how you got your name. Ev -- almost every y
ear they ask the kids
 how they got their 
name, and they™re supposed to write a repor
t about their heritage. And they™re kind of 
proud. At first 
Dustin
 wasn™t proud of
 Dustin,
 didn™t like it as mu ch. But now 
they™re -- they™re -- they™re proud of how 
they got their names.
 They don™t know 
these people very well. My father did write
 when they were bor
n, ab out the parents 
who their named after. But -- so that 
was important, to keep that going. 
Q: Did you read yo
ur parents™s books? 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

A: Yes, I did. But I didn™t -- you know, I 
read their books, but they  would test me on 
their books. You know, did you read this, an
d -- and if I -- and if I got one thing 
misquoted th ey would correct
 me, and why didn™t you reme
mb er this, and why didn™t 
you remember that. And th ey do it with my
 kids, too. And I have at least the 
temperance of years behind me, my kids ar
e not diplomatic. So, you know, yes, I™ve 
read their books, but i-it was 
-- it™s sometimes a little diffic
ult. I wanted to read it to 
understand it, enjoy it, not to 
necessarily be tested on it. Bu
t I knew most of it, not all 
of it. I™ve read my father™s 
vignettes, and I enjoyed those. 
Q: The -- the published ones? 

A: The ones that are coming out by 
Syra cuse
, because that really shows a lot of his 
character, and his -- and you know, his spun
k and his mischievousn ess, which he a 
lot of times denies. Because that really show
s a lot of him, more th an a lot of what 
the situation made of them. So yeah, I read
 the books. My olde
st son has read the 
books. My middle son has read one of th
e books, and my  youngest son has read a 
little bit. It™s difficult with him 
because he just hates to read. 
Q: What™s the relation -- I know I asked you 
before describe the -- the boys a little bit 
to me, but before we get to that also, what 
is the relationship, too, of the boys to the 
grandparents? Is -- 
is -- do th -- 
A: It™s strained. All of -- for all three kids
 it™s still strained. But 
they™re closest with 
Dustin. 
One, he was the first. And like it or 
not, even though my
 mother probably 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
48
resented the fact that she was a middle child, 
all the time says, well he™s the oldest so 
he should  get mo re. He™s the oldest, that 
he should, you know, have this kind of 
privilege. And I would look at 
her and say, but you used to
 complain about it. But it™s 
different. I don™t know how it™s different, but it™s differen t. I try not to do that to 
them. I-It™s strained because 
they would love for them to
 sit there an d look at them 
adoringly and su ck up everything they have
 to say. My father started telling the 
Holocaust stories to my son wh
en he was three years old.  
Q: Repetition of them. 

A: Yeah. So that™s why I think he started wi
th me at three -- until we put a stop to it. 
He would have nightmares. My
 older son is a very sensitive child, and I -- I think it 
warped him in some ways. He didn't do it w
ith the younger two. We really -- I says, 
you can tell them you were a soldier, you can 
tell them that bad th ings happen ed to 
children, but not the gory
 details, and he went to
 the gory details with 
Dustin
. In one 
way, he relates to them better for that. 
In another way I think that he™s a little 
saddened in  life by it. The younger two he
 -- he -- because we wouldn™t let him, 
basically. He still tells the stories, but a mu
ch more -- not -- not a positive spin, but in 
the beginning it was a positive sp
in, you know. I was a soldie
r, I survived, I -- against 
the bad guys and the 
Hitler
 and -- and so th ey don™t re
late as close. Now he™s 
beginning to tell them mo
re of the atrocities, but they don
™t want to hear it. See, my 
son -- my older son is willing to hear it, 
but the r -- the younger two are not. They™re 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
49
just not. And it hurts them tremendously. I™m
 the bridge. They can™t relate to it as 
mu ch. They™re very proud of 
them. My father, you know, th
-the -- that he survived 
the war. They™re ba -- proud of both of them, 
but they  don™t want to hear the constant 
tales of woe. My youngest one
 when he™s older probably 
will be more attuned to it, 
my  middle one, no. He won™t hear it.
 And they resent him for that.

Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with 
Esther Dezube
. This is tape number two, side
 B. 
I™d -- I want to ask you, and 
I™m not quite sure how to say it yet, but 
I -- it™ll come to me. 
Had -- do you rememb er 
being punished when  you were not good? You 
seem to me ha -- to -- you seem to me 
to have been  a very go
od, obedient girl. I think 
you calle d yourself a  goody 
goodshoe, I™m not -- but a-at least very qu
iet, and -- and - and 
good, an-and willing -- 
A: Yeah, I was punished. 
Q: -- what happened, sort of how did it ha
ppen, wh en y -- an-and did -- what did you 
-- an-and how do you reprimand 
your own children? Is there a difference in some 
ways? 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

A: Once I was hit with the belt. Most of 
the time they would either take -- a-and 
when I was older, I had 
Ba rbie™s
, they would put them in 
the attic, they would give 
them away. I had -- once had a 
Shirley Temple 
doll that my mother just shattered 
when I was bad, she was mad at me for some
thing. I don™t recall what I did, but she 
was mad at me and totally shattered it, broke
 it. It was more the isolation treatment. 
You know, they wouldn™t talk to me. Or at
 -- my  mo ther has this look th at you just 
know she doesn™t approve. And she would ke
ep looking at you like that. There would 
be yelling. I don™t think I was -- except fo
r that one time that I really  remember, I 
don™t know if I was ev er really physically
 punished after that. I was slap -- my 
mo ther would -- yeah , she -- and I -- and I did do that wh en it was in the beginning, 

but I™ve stopped that, she would take my  
arm and pinch it. That
 she would do. How 
do I reprimand my  kids? God, I tried the 
wh ole gamb it. I have three very strong 
willed child -- children and I have
, you know, children who have 
ADHD
. So they™re 
a little -- so metimes a little more
 trying. I would slap their 
hands. I would slap their 
hands. But I™d warn them. Kind of say, I™
ll give you -- and I used the word Hebrew 
ma kka h,
 because I didn™t want everybody to 
know what I was going to do. So they 
know what that word is, act
ually. And it™s, I™ll give you 
ma kka h
 if you don™t -- so 
sometimes they™d  even give me the hand. Once I slapped 
Dustin,
 I think, in the face, 
he did so mething th at was just so rude. Slap  on th e hand mo  -- and then -- then  we 
tried this method called time out, which wo
rked, because he knew I was serious, I™d 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
51
give him time out in the restaurant. Put hi
m in a corner. It™s called one, two, three 
time out. And they still know it. All I have
 to do is show them my fingers, I™m 
pointing one finger, two finger, three fingers
 and they knew I meant time out. It™s a 
little hard when  the oldest one is 18. Now hi
s method is I take his car keys. But that™s 
-- that™s how I do it. That™s my punishment. 

Q: How did -- how did you rela
te -- or how do you relate 
to your husband™s family? 
Is that a good relationship? 
A: My husband isn™t close to his own fam
ily, so it makes it much
 easier. He™s okay -- 
my husband isn™t a close, wa
rm ki nd of person, though his 
mother tr ies in -- in - - on 
her behalf, I must admit, her mother tries 
to keep the family t
ogether. His father™s 
dead. His father was a very kind, gentle 
man who was a hermit. He would sit on the 
couch, you have no clue
 he was there. But he was very fair. You know, when  he had 
something to  say he would say it, but he wa
s fair. I get along with  his mo ther, but his 
mo ther likes to talk about his mo ther. I m
ean, it™s interesting wh en  I go to her house, 
she™s very nice, she™ll give me care packag
es, she™ll send things and she tries. B u t 
when the kids are there, she doesn™t intera
ct with the kids. That happened with my  
parents too, cause they didn™t know how to
 interact with them. And I rememb er very 
clearly, 
Dustin
 was four years old and told  my  mo ther off. I would never dream of 
telling my mother off, but he told my moth
er off. She was mad at
 me that I brought 
up my  son th at way, by the way. 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

Q: And what was it -- what was the situation 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Oh, I remember it very clear
ly. He said, ﬁYou come up here 
supposingly
 to visit 
us, and all you do is read a book.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁWhy do you bother to
 come to see us?ﬂ I 
think my mother was in shock after that. And 
she tried to make an 
effort after that, to 
do like chess with them, or so
mething like that, or walk w
ith them. She still doesn™t 
know how to deal with 
them. I don™t think she knew how to deal with me. 
Q: You never challenged them
 in any way, in that -- 
A: They™ll say I challenged them all the tim
e, but I don™t think I did. Not in any 
major way, no. Ag ain, clothes or whatev
er, but not in a major way. Not in -- 
Q: How -- how did you feel, or -- how 
-- how did you feel 
-- how did you see 
yourself? How did you feel, re
ally feel about yourself? 
A: I like myself better now than I did then
. Didn™t like myself that much. I always 
saw my self as ugly. Fat, which is probably
 accurate. Not as much self confidence. I 
was willing to take a lot more 
crap, probably, than I am now. 
Q: Did you ever see a psychologist or some
thing, or was that some thing you would 
never do? 
A: No, I would -- when I was -- I saw a psyc
hologist once or twice. I reme mb er once, 
I don™t know. I don™t rememb er the story, I 
took a knife out of a -- out of the drawer 
and said I would kill myself. 
My mother made me see a ps
ychologist and I s -- the 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
53
psychologist said, she was just acting out, ther
e™s no issue in there. I don™t know wh at 
started that, I really don™t.  
Q: Did -- did the psychologist k
now th-the fam
ily background? 
A: I don™t know. I was young, so I do
n™t know. Do I see a c -- yeah, I see a 
psychologist, I have no objections for se
eing a co -- psychologist. My kids see a 
psychologist, we have a fami ly psychologist
 now. And we, you know, try -- with my  

husband sometimes we need to wo rk on ou
r -- we come from different backgrounds, 
different viewpoints in life, and if we
™re going to make this marriag e work, 
sometimes we need a mediator. So I have
 no objections about se
eing a psychologist. I 
know my -- I know that my 
father received shock treatm
ent wh en I grew up, an d he 
was seeing somebody. I -- I found this out la
ter on, I didn't know when  I was young 
that he was receiving shock treatment. I -- I don™t think my fa
ther really takes care of 
himself, knowing a lot mo re about my  ki
ds, and th e fact that they do have 
ADHD
. 
It™s genetic, and I™m positive my father has 
it. He™s been diagnosed, I think, bipolar
.
 
That -- I do see a lot of that in them and 
I think if he had gotten help  younger, it -- he 
would have been a lot better for it. But he 
doesn™t want help in that regard. And it™s 
just like my  middle son, you have to acknowle
dge that there™s an issue in order to  get 
help. It™s a difficult thing to do. 

Q: I think in the late 60™s, or even a littl
e earlier, sort of studies about Holocaust 
survivors came out, psychological studies, did you ever read those? 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
54
A: No. 
Q: No.  

A: There was a woman who once called me from 
California
 and said they were 
doing a study, would I be willi
ng to be a participant and I 
said yes. So I didn™t mind 
that. I don™t read all the Holo caust books th
at my  parents do. I™m not a me mb er of 
Second Generation, wh ich my  parents are extr
emely upset at me for. And it™s not that 
I turn my back on th
e Holo caust, because I don™t. I te
ll my  kids about it. I am proud 
that my parents are survivors. I am proud in
 a lot of things that they instill me, and I 
try -- I tell my kids that. Th
ey know that my fa
ther is a holo -- they ™re very proud of 
him, like I said, in many ways
. But I can™t live it, eat it
 and breathe it like they do. 
And on top of it, I have three tough cookies
 of kids. I don™t have the time. You have 
to give something up. And wh ere my  father
 probably would not th
ink of anything of -
- you know, running here and there, and m
eetings and not really raising me because 
that™s what he did, I can™t do th
at. And he doesn™t understand that. 
Q: Did you read some of the books th
at were written by ch
ildren of Holocaust 
survivors? 
Helen Epstein -- Epstein [indecipherable]
 in the -- I think in -- in ™79 it 
was published. 
A: No. 
Q: Never -- 

A: I read -- 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
55
Q: -- curious? You didn™t know ab
out it, you didn™t want to get -- 
A: I would go to  lectures. I™d go to bra -- 
Brandeis
 has lecture series, I™ve gone to 
those. And to -- there™s a movie series. I™ve gone to th at. I™ve seen, you know, 
Euro pa, Europa
, I™ve seen some of that. It™s not 
that I™m not curious, but that I™ve 
had so mu ch  of it that I™m not so sure necessarily I™m going to  be enlightened  about 
it, because I think I have a pretty good 
grasp of how these people suffered and the 
tales may change, but the 
basic outline is there. 
Q: Well actually, the -- the -- the last ques
tion was not so much about your -- the 
survivors, but about the child
ren of the survivors, whether you kind of -- if you read 
books about the second generation, wh ether you 
were interested in it, first of all, to 
read those, and if you did, did you find y
ourself in them, or do you feel that you don™t 

quite fit there either? Is -- 

A: No, I haven™t read it so mu ch, but it™s very interesting is that you know who 

another child survivor is. If I 
walk in the room I can tell,
 and they can tell. I can™t 
explain it. 

Q: Try. 

A: It™s like when I went to a 
Schecter 
meeting and there was another woman there 
and we talked. And I found out she was a su
rvivor -- a child surv
ivor, and we just 
knew that each other were child survivors,
 it™s some -- maybe our outlook on life. 
We™re a little more serious, maybe. Probabl
y a little more warped
. Family, I think, 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
56
for child survivors are very important. I find th
at is a unifying fact in every one of the 
child survivors that I™ve met.
 There™s this w o man now from 
Israel
, that we met 
through another family, child 
surviv -- you know, 
survivor, and we™re -- we™re close, 
it just -- I know wh at you™ve gone through,
 I know the stories that you™ve gone 
through. I know that, you kn
ow, your parents always sa
y that, you know, we didn™t 
have this and you do.
 And we™re doing all this for yo
u cause we have no one else. 
You just know. And you know that either you™
re going to resent your parents for it, 
or you try to deal with it. I don™t resent 
them for who they  are. Maybe wh en I was 
younger a little bit. I can understand that th
ey went through hell, and that I™m ju st 
going to  have to be accepting of who they  ar
e. I™m not going to be able to change 
them. You know, for many years you try to
 change somebody, and you realize you 
can™t do that. So you either respect them, 
or you distance yourse
lf, or you want to 
have nothing to do with th
em, those are the three choice
s. When you don™t have a 
family, that™s not an option. They™re the only 
things that I have to a family, so it™s 
just not an option. And so th
at™s why I keep telling my  kids
, this is all we have. We 
don™t have anybody else. You have to st
and up fo r each other. Yo u have to stick 
together. That kind of bonding I™m not sure 
is in a regular family. Everybody else is 
doing th eir own thing and not -- I tell the br
others, you better protect each other. Who 
else do you have? Yo u know, you bette
r understand, you may not like what 
[indecipherable]
 have to do. They come in and 
my father will scream at them, 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

57
they™re not wearing socks. And they say, we
™re not cold. And that we™re bad children 
because we don™t tell our kids to wear so
cks when they command 
it. But I tell them, 
you know, you have 
to understand from where they
™re coming from. Put yourselves 
in their shoes. I don™t know wh ether or not if
 you™re not a survi -- child surv ivor that 
you can understand that. Or if
 you™re not gone through th
at kind of generation, I 
don™t know. 
Q: Among your friends, are ther
e any ch ildren of surv ivors? 
A: No. Except for that one fri
end who is Israeli, yes. I -- I -- like I b elong to a group 
of -- 
Havurah
 group, no, none of them. 
Q: Conscious choice or happenstance, or who knows? 

A: I think it was more happenstance. I mean
 I am friendly with th is woman who is a 
survivor, but part of it subconsciously co
uld be I still want -- I want to be an 
American. I want to fit in. I don™t know 
whether I™m co -- more closely to a lin -- 
aligned to these people be-because they™re
 Americans, but you know, if you also 
associate with survivors, 
you tend to bring it up a lot mo re. That means you™re 
reliving it and reliving it and 
reliving it. And I don™t want to do th at. When  the 
articles come out on my parents, I™m proud, 
I-I show them to my kids, and they  read 
them. The little one is proud because his fath
er is famo -- grandfather, you know, is 
famous, he looks at it that way, and you kn
ow -- my father goes, well, that™s not a 
good enough reason. I said, let him bond th
at way. Wh en he™s older he can develop

other -- a-and 
Dustin 
is much more respective of my parents now as he™s older and 
understands more. So I see that th e time is 
coming. They don™t see that. They  had no 
parents. They had no parents who ever butt 
into their lives, so they don™t understand 
when or when not to butt into
 our lives. They just never 
had any mentors. So -- a-and 
that™s why we sent them to 
Schecter
, to be proud of th eir heritage, of who th ey are. 
And again, to make sure that it won™t happen
 again to them. And I think they see that. 
I mean, my  -- my mid d le one will go into a 
restaurant, very -- very -- and say, hey, 
there™s Christma s stuff , but there™s no 
Ha nukka h
 stuff, why? I don™t think an 
American kid would really pa
y attention to that. So it has sunk in a little bit, you 
know? I me an, maybe not the way that my  pa
rents -- but he™s very
 proud of who he 
is. He™s very proud that he™s Jewish. It 
was difficult cause my  oldest son was dating a 
non-Jew. I think my mother 
was much more willing to se
e -- let™s wait and see, my 
father went -- still goes bananas over it. Absolutely goes banana -- has major battles 
with my son. 
Q: How do you feel about that? 
A: I -- if it™s on tape and they marry I™m 
in trouble, but I don™t like her, because I 
don™t like her. I don™t like her personality. He k
nows that I would be very upset if he 
married a non-Jew an d wouldn™t bring the chil
dren up Jewish. I would -- i-if the -- if 
the person would co nvert, I don™t have an i
ssue. I don™t. Then  they ™re as good as 
anyone else. Because I think pa
rt of our heritage would 
be lost. And I -- and I am 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
59
very close to that. I mean, my son™s 
Bar Mitzvahs
 -- you know, when  you have a kid 
who lives in an affluent 
society and he™s having a 
Ba r Mitzvah
, it™s very difficult to 
have him not focused on what 
gifts I™m going to get, versus, do you understand wh at 
this mean? That this is a tr
adition that you are perpetuatin
g over thousands of years. 
That if you™re not proud of who you are as
 a Jew, people will step on you. Maybe an 
American doesn™t understand that. And I 
look. If somebody™s talking about Jews, or 
saying so mething and I hear it in the back
ground, I™ll speak up. 
I™m very proud of 
this person, his name is 
Lenny Za kim
. He died of a brain tumo r last year, he was 47 
-- t-two years ago, almost. They ™re actually debating to  name a -- the new brid ge in 
Boston 
after him. He was part of the 
ADL
, and he went to law school with me 
[indecipherable]
 was -- he was a year ahead. I wa
sn™t socially -- we were not on 
social basis, but we always used to  say he
llo to each other from 
the same law school. 
And he would really go around, and make 
sure about an ti-Semitism and stuff. But it 
was only -- not only anti-Semitism, it was 
anti blacks, anti anybody who had issues. 
And I think I™m instilling that
 in my  kids, about discrimi
nation. That™s a product of 
the Holo caust. It™s not only discrimination 
that you™re Jewish, and believe me, I™ve 

had some anti-Semitism, I haven™t had a lot.
 My kids haven™t had so much, so they 
don™t know yet what it is, but they will, a
nd I want them to be prepared for it. 

 
Interview with Esther Dezube

Q: I just have actually a -- a couple of 
follow up questions. Otherwise, I think we 
have touched on a lot of important things. An
d one is a very practical one. I forgot to 
ask you when, just for the record
, when your children were born. 
A: 
Dustin 
was born March 11
th
, 1983. 
Aaron
 was born December 17
th
, 1987, and 
Michael 
was born February 28
th
, 1990. I have to say one 
thing is though, I™ve had 
many miscarriages. That™s why I have the bi
g gap between the oldest and the middle. 
And because I really wanted a family, I neve
r gave up. I had eight miscarriages -- no 
-- yeah, eight miscarriages, th
ree live births. And I think part of that keeping me 
going, although I would get almo st hives 
when I would go in to 
the op -- the -- the -- 
the gynecologist™s office was that I really
 wanted a family th 
-- to perpetuate our 
heritage. That was very important to me. 
So I just didn™t give
 up. And they know 
that. I mean, I sing 
Shema
 to them every night, and even
 my s -- oldest one still asks 
for that. To understand, you know, that th
is is where it™s coming from. I don™t know -
- 
Shema
 is an affirmation of one God, but it™s 
also supposed to be said as the last 
thing on your mouth before death. And then
, just you know, make
 sure that they 
understand that. 
Q: One other question until I remember anot
her one, is sort of political. You have 
gone thro ugh, in your t
eens actually, Civil Rights movement, Women™s movement, 
all of these things kind of are also part 
of wh o you are to some degree at least. To

what kind of degree? What -- what -- what
 moved you, politica
lly speaking? What 
was important to you? 
A: Justice. I was for the Women™s moveme
nt for equality and for ju stice. I don™t go 
over backwards on it. I mean, I don™t want 
any mo re rights, but I want to be 
respected. I am -- I™ve dealt w
ith that personally. I was a 
women™s lawyer where they 
were just starting to have wo men lawyers. 
I mean, there were men in my class, but 
the older men didn™t have women in their 
classes. I was called deary during trials. 
And -- and -- and my theory in life, as I ha
ndle almo st everything
 with that one is 
somebody goes -- this one woman that was 
just outraged that he was calling me 
deary, aren™t you going to say anything to  
him? And I said, no, because I™m not going 
to change him. But if I™m a deary, I™m stupid, so I™m going to  take it to my  

advantage, and just prep are. And I won that
 trial. And my basic thing is I start off 
with honey. Burn  me and you
™re in trouble. And then I™
ll y -- rant, rave and scream, 
but I usually don™t rant, rave and scream 
first, cause I saw my
 parents rant -- my 
father rant, raving and screaming. I™m not su
re that he was better off for it. I had a -- I 
was pregnant with my  first child and th ey 
told me I was unfit to 
try the case. Not the 
judge, but an attorney  on th e other side, 
because I would be going to the bath room 
too much. He was a black a
ttorney. The judge threw -- it
 was Christmas eve, th e 
judge threw it out, and said I™m not touching
 this -- at least he was wise enough -- 
I™m not touching this one. It™s mu ch 
better for the younger 
women attorneys, I

guarantee you. They  didn't have to fight th
at. I campaigned when I was in college, for 
Scoop Jackson. 
I went around and I did a lot of 
political planning, but a -- it was a -- 
politics is a very dirty animal. I didn™t lik
e the dirt. So I -- and especially for a 
woman, it™s much e -- more of a dirty anim
al. I fight for justice wherever it is. F o r 
special education and stuff like that. I™m 
an independent. I™m 
registered as an 
independent, because then I™m 
not locked in the primary to  vote for a Republican or 
Democrat, and I wanted to see where my vot
e counts. So I™m more
 of that. I mean, I 
hear what™s going on with 
Go re
 and -- and I™m outraged because I think th at there 

were a lot of shenanigans go
ing on and the people™s votes weren™t counted. It™s not so 
mu ch  
Go re
 as a person to win, or 
Bush, 
though I think 
Bush
 is an idiot. But the fact 
is that these people were tu
rned away from voting, these vo
tes didn™t count. And that 
gets my gall. It™s the underd og again,
 that gets my gall. I™ve rallied for 
Israel
. I don™t 
do it so much now. I™m a little 
more laid back now than I 
used to be, but that™s the 
only way I can handle my  work  load an
d my  kids. Cause I don™t have three 
wallflowers. I mean, sometime
s I wish for three wallflowers, but I don™t have them. 

And I want to make sure that they grow up
 to be people that 
give to the community, 
that™s important to me. They give someth
ing of themselves to
 the community. My 
oldest son gave 
10 percent of his 
Bar Mitzvah 
money to charity, to the Home of 
Little Wanderers. That was -- I didn't care 
which charity, but it was imperativ e that 
he gave. My youngest one says, I know, I 
have to give. So at least I -- you know,

good. You™re going to have to give. And he
 chose -- you know, he™s gonna choo -- he 
chose that Home for Little Wanderers, so he
™s going to give. That™s important, for 

my  kids to give back  to the community  and 
not always take. It™s not easy, especially 
when  you live in an affluent community. Bu
t my  oldest one work s at a soup kitchen. 
Third week of the mo nth he cooks and he
 delivers. My youngest one -- my middle 
one does a little bit. M y  youngest one has to 
be pushed a little. He™s
 probably not as 
giving at the others. But we™re wo rking on it. 
Q: I have one more question, but before I 
ask that final one, is there anything that 
relates to what we have talked about, an
d that I haven™t asked -- touched upon, or 
that™s important for you to say? 
A: I think part of the Holocaust children 
don™t want -- do not wa
nt to be seen as 
different, a-although we are. We want to 
be normal. I don™t know what normal is, but 
we want to be normal. And the only probl
em is our viewpoint of normalcy comes 
from a different plane than other people. I 
think that we carry -- we™re a bridge, we 
really are. And we carry the torch to our 
younger generation, our kids, to make sure 
that they don™t forget. And 
it™s very hard, because unless 
they™re living with their 
grandparents, they can™t understand as mu ch
, and you do, so you 
don™t know what to 
do. You understand wh ere they™re coming 
from, because they™re removed and you 
understand where you parents are coming fro
m, because you lived with it. And so

you get battled from both ends
. And sometimes you feel li
ke the mediator between 
generations. And it™s -- it™s not the easiest thing to do. 
Q: And my last question is why di
d you agree to do this interview? 
A: Part curiosity. Part my parents, and pa
rt that I want people to understand who we 
are, and to be accepted for who we are. 

Q: Well thank you very mu ch fo r 
having accepted the interview.
