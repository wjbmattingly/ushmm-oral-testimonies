A: Now Dad, I think when I was five years ol
d, then he moved in  here Œ to there, to 
live with us befo
re we work  in 
Wo lkowysk
, and my sister says that I Œ when he 
wanted to ke Œ to hug me, I would run away. 
Q: Really? 
A: So Œ so I was always ru
nning away from him,
 until when he stay
 for good, then I 
got to know him, and he was very , very go
od father. He let us do more things than 
my  mo m wo u ld  Œ 
Q: So sh e was stricter? 
A: Œ you know, more danger
ous. Oh yeah, because she 
worried that we will get 
hurt, and he would say, that™s okay, let them do it. 
Q: That™s all Œ that sounds 
so much like a mother and a 
father. A mother thinks of 
protection, a father thinks the 
ch ild has to stretch and grow. 
A: Yeah. One time we were playing hi Œ 
hide and seek, and he put me high on the 
shelf behind the door in the kitchen, and 
told me don™t move, sit there. So I was 

sitting there and the Œ and di Œ the other ch
ildren were looking in 
the house, outside, 
can™t Œ running forth and back to  f Œ and 
they couldn™t find me, and I Œ I was sitting 
petrified. So anyway Œ 

Q: So did he finally come ge
t you, or did you climb down? 
A: Oh yeah. No, no, he Œ he had to take
 me down because they couldn™t find me.

that noise next room, doors were closed, 
and I try to sit down. And th

that door I saw light in the next room. 
So I sat down and that minute when  I sit 
down , door open, and the police Œ that wa
s a soldier, and he saw something moving 
in bed, right away pointed the gun with ba
yonet at me. A nd from that time, he was 
after me. Then I wanted to 
go to washroom. I 
ha-had to  go outsid
e. So he follow 
me. And halfway I turn around to  see, and 
he was there walking with the gun after 
me. So after I was done, went back to the 
house, and then that Œ all noise and, you 
know, troi Œ the things were laying on th
e bed Œ floors, and bringing in the stuff.

 my pictures that I have f-few pi-pictures 
in envelope of my self from school an-and
 that. So I was protecting them, and I put 
in the pocket, my jack et pocket, and then 
apparently, when the 
soldier put my  dad™s 
long coat on me, and carry me to the sled
, apparently somehow that must fall out, 
that pictures, because when  I was on the sl

cry, because that™s only Œ I treasure th
e pictures, you know. That™s all what Œ 
Q: That™s all you had.

Q: Yeah. 

A: And that™s all. And then 
when they took us, I know that
 they said that two hours 
we have to  get ready. But how long it took 
for them to come b
ack, because some of 
them had to go and pick up 
neighbors from our settlement. 
Q: Oh, I see. 

A: That™s why they had to go  and bring them to join us.

a son of that family. And every day I wo
uld sit by that little table by the window, 
just little table like Œ like th
is, from this to this, and 
watch people coming from the 
store. He was the only one, many times he
 would go fo r the bread. He was the only 
one bringing big loaf of white bread. An
d Œ and Œ and Œ and be
sides that lo Œ big 
white bread, because that™s well baked so 
you Œ you get more, and I think so me of 
that black, but Œ 
Q: You™d have a Œ 

A: Œ and I was always sitting 
and dreaming, oh, if I could 
have that piece of bread. 
And my  Œ one time my Œ my  mom send my  si

if they could give wh ite bread so she co
uld give to baby. And she came back, she

ys, we don™t have. But that family always 
could get, every day. 
Q: Isn™t that interestin g. 
A: Yeah, that™s Œ and I never forgot th
at, because I Œ you dream ya Œ how mu ch 
food you had in

35
A: No idea. But I make sure that I w
ill be in that window watching him, and 
thinking how must been really ta Œ good to
 have piece of bread like that. So that™s 
all what I know. 
Q: Did he ever speak to  you, or you sp oke to him? 
A: No, no. He wa Œ I was ki
d, and he was grown-up, I d
on™t know how old he was,

Q: Yeah. 
A: No idea, but well-built, tall an d well-built, you know. That™s a Œ 
Q: Okay . Hang on Œ hang on ju
st a second. I know that you are sitting there in the 
background, Mrs. 
Stanis
awa
, is this a gentleman Œ did he 
belong to that family that 
informed on other people? 

A2: He was as Œ just related. 

Q: He was related to them. 

A2: But Œ but he came all the way here beca
use he was the one of th e people that 
was telling on other Polish mee
tings, and whatever. And so
 his Œ his treatment of 
the family was by Œ as a 
reward for Œ for that. 
Q: Okay , so wh at Œ wh at your sister said
 is Œ in her testimony sh e said that there 
was one family who got bette
r treatment because they would info rm on others. And 
I asked whether this man who had been involv
ed in the arrest of your father, was in 

 
Interview with Irene Sobczak  
 
Jauary 28, 2015 
 

 
 
36
any way part of this family. And sh e said 
yes, he is related to them, and he got 
better treatment because he in
formed on what other people
 were doing. Have I got 
that right? 
A2: Right. 
Q: Yeah, okay. Thank you. 
Do  you  rememb e r  h i s n a me?  
A: His name, no. Bu t that other name Œ 

A2: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: That other name of family, the 
boy was going with me to school in 
Mexico
. 
Q: Really? 
A: He was with parents Œ oh, I think ho Œ 
he had both parents, I think, and I was in 
orphanag e, but in school they kept togeth
er. Was very nice boy th at Œ my  age right 
away, too. So that 
[indecipherable]
 you know, wh at have you, was really nice. 
Q: And so you remembered this. What 
was Œ what else do you rememb er about 
when  you first arrived, and saw those barr
acks, and saw where you would be living? 
Can you tell us, you know,
 wh at that looked like? 
A: Well, it was a cold place, that™s one th
ing, because wh en we came in there™s no 
fire, no nothing. So the on Œ I remember ev
erything wh at was there. The bed, made 
from boards, bigger bed on one side, and on
e on that, and that little table with two Œ 
I don™t know, benches Œ

37
Q: Stools? 
A: Stools, I think, on both si
des Œ no, i Œ okay, but ther Œ 
Q: Stools. 
A: Œ for one person. And th at stove was in 
that corner, and I think, like my sister 
says, that was Œ on our side, in that co
rner was that metal bed where my da Œ 
brother, when he came, would come when 
he had rheumatoid arthritis, he would 
hang to that bed, you kn
ow, from the pain, you know. 
And you could hear that 
movement he was making with that bed, fro
m the pain, you know. 
So that Œ that™s Œ 
you know Œ 

Q: That™s what you remember. 
A: Yeah, oh yeah. 
Q: Yeah. Do you remember, 
did anybody come and tell you why you were there Œ 
A: Mm-mm. 

Q: Œ why you had been  arrested? 
A: No, not here, but in 
Poland
 we knew, because my  dad was taking part in Wo rld 
War I fighting, and I think my  Œ wh en th
ey  were collecting like gold or something 
for the country, then  my  dad an d Œ gave
 his, and my  mo m™s wedding band, donated. 
And so that, for that, I thin
k that™s what they put Œ 
Q: As the reason? 

 
Interview with Irene Sobczak  
 
Jauary 28, 2015 
 

 
 
38
A: Œ in his rec-record Œ re
cord, you know. That I reme
mber, because that™s what 
Dad was to Œ telling, you know. 
Q: I see. So when he was released from the fi
rst arrest, he said th
at Œ that one of the 
reasons he was arrested was because of th
at, because of se Œ 
you know, his giving 
some things to sup
port the Polish army. 
A: Yeah, yeah. And they kept records so 
well, because they knew what he Œ what 
he did in the life that h e Œ they knew th
at he had a gun, a rifle or something, but 
they took already that one,
 before th e end, you know. 
Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember
 when they  took th e gun? Were you in the house? 
A: That I don™t remember vividly, when  th
ey came for that, but I know th at they 
did, because my  parents were mentioning that, you know, few times. 

Q: Okay . And now we™v e just digr
essed to talk about back in 
Poland
, you know, 
before that Œ you were deport
ed. So let™s go back to this
 area. Where Œ what did the 
forest look like? Were you in th e middle of a forest? 
A: No. The forest, one piece was on the 
side, on one side of our settle Œ  
Q: Your settle Œ your camp. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 camp, the houses, because we 
have house. We had three Œ 
three or four buildings besides that, you kno
w. And so that was farther there. Then 
one far, far away there, in that direction, 
and then fields, and then  on the other side. 

 
Interview with Irene Sobczak

39
Q: So the forests were not close in Œ 
A: No. 

Q: Œ they were further away. 
A: Yeah, but this one was th
e closest because it fr Œ I th i
nk when they were building 
their house, then they were cutting that Œ 
Q: Forest. 

A: Œ forest by th e house there. And you could see it there. 
Q: And what kind of trees were they, were they Œ 
A: Wait a minute, how you call them? Pines, yeah, pines Œ 

Q: Pines. 
A: Œ a lot. 
Q: Pine tree, okay. 

A: Yeah, na Œ a lot. But in one section of 
the forest, on that side, they had, I think, 
b r zo zo wy
 in 
Poland Œ 
Polish, quite Œ 
A2: Birch. 

A: Birch. 

Q: Got it. 
A: And the only place that the mu
shrooms grew is in that Œ

A: Yeah. And this one had 
a little blueberries, you know, 
and strawberries, wild , on 
the outsk irts of Œ 

Q: On th e outskirts. 

A: So Œ so we were
 lucky, you know. 
Q: Yeah. So Œ so the settlement, it sounds 
like this camp  area was in a Œ in an open 
place, surrounded Œ 

A: Wait, you are talking about 
Poland
, right? 
Q: No, I was talking Œ 
A: Oh, wait a minute, I was talking about 
Poland
. 
Q: You were talking 
about your land in  
Poland
? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Oh, no, no, no, no, 
that™s your home in 
Poland
 you were talking about. 
A: Yeah, yes. 

Q: No, I™m talking about wh
ere you were deported to. 
A: Oh, okay. So, when we were driving, I th
ink, with the train,

people in the winter when is everything 
frozen, because in the area we were, it w as 
swamps, lakes, trees. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So th at Œ otherwise, in the summer, 
you cannot escape from there. And then  Œ 
Q: Why?  
A: Because Œ 

Q: Are you surrounded by water? 
A: Swamps. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And water, and trees, you know. There™s no 
end of the wo ods. And wh en th ey ke 
Œ brought us to camp 
Teshuava
(ph), that used to be trees,
 but they cut that out for Œ 
to make the camp. So that™s Œ on one side 
is the lake, big lake, I think 26 kilo meters 
long, and four or six ki Œ 

Q: Wide? 
A: Œ wide, yeah. So  here we have la
ke, and then, surroun
ded by Œ by woods. But 
little distan ce, you know, for the camp f Œ 
we had f-for buildings. And th at way is 
north, or what have you. Th

they already collected th-the
 g Œ potatoes, harvest the pot
atoes, then I went, toward 
the evening, to cemetery. And then next to
 was the field, and I thought, maybe I will 
find something. So  I was looking. I don™t 
rememb er if I found any piece of potato. 
But then, when I stood ther
e on that hill on cemetery and 
looked down, 
I felt like I 
am bird in the cage. 
Q: Really? 

A: Just see the opening this, and then all 
woods. So that™s Œ that never Œ I never 
forgot that, you know. 

Q: So you felt Œ you were
 on the top of a hill. 
A: Yeah, that™s cemetery was higher up. It
 wasn™t real tall, but it was a hill, you 
know. 

Q: Was it a large cemetery? 

A: Oh, pretty Œ pretty nice size

A: But on th e trees, some of them, they had too. 
Q: They also had their names. 

A: Yeah, yeah. So we weren™t the first ones to
 be sended there and die in that place, 
you know. 

Q: What was the camp  manager like? 

A: Well, I Œ I don™t know, but apparently 
he mu st be not too bad if he gave my  
mo m a glass of milk for baby, because he couldn™t give you mu ch , because if he 
had one cow, you know? 
Q: And he did that one time, huh? 

A: I don™t know how many times, but my

leave tomo rrow with  a-adults. And they 
to ok them about, I don™t know, I don™t Œ 

that stuck in my  head  somehow, 30 kilme 
Œ kilometers deep in
 the woods, where 

 
Interview with Irene Sobczak  
 
Jauary 28, 2015 
 

 
 
44
they had to cut the trees, and 
then bring that to the shor
es, when the lake was Œ or 
river was frozen. That™s what Œ whol
e winter they were doing th at. And Œ 
Q: Was there a camp kitchen?
 Was there like a cafeteria? 
A: They had u Œ they had k
itchen that they ha
d big, big, big th
at kettle, and they 
make soup, using dry fish a
nd some noodles, but Œ but when  you got that soup, you 
were lucky if you had one 
or two noodles. You got mo
re worms floating on that, 
because from dry fish, you kn
ow, they spoil, and the wo
rms take over. So that™s Œ 
and one scoop, you kn
ow, like soup scoop Œ 
Q: Did you Œ 

A: Œ you get. 
Q: Mm-hm. Was Œ 
A: And then  40 grams of bread if you had 
money to buy, for each child or person, 
that they didn™t 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So you had Œ you had a 
ration, but you had to al
so pay for this ration. 
A: Yes, yes. That™s why we try to help my  mo m. We™d go after school and cu t 

wood to Œ to  get some money, or go fo r cr
anberry Œ pick ing cran
berry in the Œ deep 
in the woods, to sell, so we
 will get few ca Œ cents, you know, for that. Yeah. And 
then we had to Œ we wanted 
to  h elp  my  mo m, so  we w
ould go, two of us, take the 
sled, take the saw that™s for two people, 
and cut the tr-tree down, and th en cu t in

pieces, put on th e sled and drag, because it 
was maybe half hou Œ half mile, or Œ or 
more, yeah. And that™s Œ you see that in  the summer, the swamps
, so they put the 
big logs where you are walking. In the wi
nter that™s frozen, so you could walk  
through Œ 
Q: You could walk on that, yeah. 

A: Œ on that, you know, that help. But we dr
ag that in. But my  mom says, I told you 
don™t cut so big trees. It take Œ you know Œ 
but we wanted to do the best we could. 
And we knew how to cut be
cause then, when tree was 
falling, when we found out 
and we™d 
[indeciphera ble]
 and we will shout, you know
, some expression we had, 
and run to  Œ 
Q: Run to that place, yeah. 
A: So, you know, but Œ 

Q: Tell me about your brother, your little brother. 

A: Oh, th at Œ you see, when  he die on the 
Œ the last min u tes, I was in the room, and 
my  mo m Œ he was crying. He
 had wounds on the neck, 
and sh e said, hold his hand, 
so she wanted to get something. And I™m 
holding the hand, and he jerk, and start 
scratching, and that start bleeding. And wh en
 I saw that, I faint. And poor mother, I 
know that she pick me up, put me on th e be
d, and took care of the baby. But I don™t

know if that was on that day that he die, 
or next day, but that
™s what Œ I have bad 
memory of that. 
Q: Was he very Œ had Œ did he
 Œ did he Œ had he 
lost Œ did he have any meat on him, 
was he skin and bones, was he starving? 

A: Oh, he was starving, for sure, because
 when my mom had leftover honey cake 
from 
Poland
, when she finished that, the bread 
she couldn™t give him, because that 
was too hard for his stomach. So I don™t 
know wh at she was giving him, but not 
what he needed. And that™s 
why  my  mo m se n t  my  sister  
to the store, to ask for 
white bread if they could give at least 
one pe Œ little piece of it, you know, but he 

says no, we don™t have. But he had for Œ 
Q: Somebody Œ 
A: Œ for them. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: For th em he always had. So  I guess that™s, you know, what life Œ 
Q: That was very bitter.

you buried your brother?

A2: The

A: I reme Œ  oh, I don™t know, but I saw 
them two laying there. Because that™s 
winter, very  Œ 

A2: They  were in 
a grave, but not Œ

A2: Yeah  
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Oh, okay. 
Q: And that she had her coffin.

Q: Tha-That there were two of them. 
A: But then we went and Œ ev
ery day went to take care of
 the grave, and we really 
loved him, and t-took him fo
r walks, and it was Œ and that™s what my mom said, 
wouldn™t be for him, 
she wouldn™t survive. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, he was keeping her Œ because sh
e knew that without her, he wouldn™t 
survive too, you know. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. So what 
happened with her later? 
A: My  mom?  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Oh, like when  we were in 
Vologda
 Œ 
Q: No, no, I meant, not in 
Volo gda
, but I mean, after he died. 
A: Oh. Oh, she was very sad,
 but the life had to go on. Oh  yeah , one time Œ I don™t 
know, was there two policemen, or what, tw
o military guys, or what. Two Œ I think 
two of them came, and they were going 
th rough Œ all around, and looking fo r 
children to take to 
orphanage, especially the ones 
that the mother
s couldn™t work . 
And they  came, and they wanted  to take my  sister and me. And th ey didn™t Œ babies 
they wouldn™t take. And we begged my  mo
m Œ they needed her permission, so we 
cry and beg. So he says, I will come to
ward the evening, and see what, you know, 

 
Interview with Irene Sobczak

my mom will Œ what decision she will make. 
So whole day we just hang around her 
and begging not to give us. And when  they
 came, she says no, I won™t give them, 
you take this baby. And they
 said no, we ca Œ we Œ we
 want those older ones. And 
they left. So we stay with
 our mo m. So that second time that I almost lost Œ 
separated in 
Poland
, and now second time. 
Q: Right, right, from her. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And it was Œ and they wanted Œ th-they Œ 
was it that they want
ed that she be for 
Œ be able to go to wo rk? 
A: No, because she couldn™t 
work. So this way they kn
ew that she has hardship. 
A2: They would kill her. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So that™s Œ I think that™s the reason. 
Q: Wait, I Œ I don™t understand, that she had 
ha Œ they  wanted to take you, so that Œ 
A: She will have easier. 
Q: So th at she would have it easier? 
A: Yeah, I guess.

A2: I think they would take
 her and Œ and destroy her. 
Q: Your sister is thinking Œ 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: Œ that they Œ if they took
 you two, then  they would have been able to take her out 
and Œ and shoot her or de
stroy her in some way. 
A: That I don™t know. 

Q: Yeah, but you know Œ y
eah, it sounds like in both ca
ses, it™s supposition. You 
don™t know really why Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ why they Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ were doing this, or wanted to do this.  
A2: They  would do the sa

A: Well, we had two in Ru ssian, and they  
were pretty good teachers because they 
would teach us how to write so nicely from 
one line to the other, the letters had to 
be. And math was good too, and like they 
were teaching the Œ that no Œ there is no 
God, we had in my class from the same 
thing. Now when the 
teacher would go and 
do inspection about each child
, and when we Œ I had the medal, I would put 
underneath chair™s leg, to hide it. So  this 
way Œ otherwise, he would take away from 
me. 
Q: Oh, you mean a religious medal? 
A: Yeah, oh yeah . And Œ but Œ and then 
we had to learn a lot of poems, Russian 
poems, everything Ru ssian. And one time, 
I was going to  school in the mo rning, 
was very, very windy, and that gate was l
oose, had loose board s, and the wind blew, 
and that big nail, rusted nail went with Œ in  my  knee here Œ 

Q: In your leg. 

A: Œ in the bone, all the way to bone. So
 my  mo m kept me at home, because I was 
getting in fection, and Œ and one
 time teacher came to check on me if I am really 
sick, because otherwise she would 
lock hi Œ her in that last Œ 
Q: That jail room. 
A: Yeah. And sh e had to open 
up, and then  show him that Œ 
Q: That you™re really sick.

A: Yeah, and with chamomile, 
she ra Œ she Œ she managed to heal that. But I had to 
lay all the time in. But that was the 
only mirac Œ thing that she could have. 
Q: That she could th ink of, yeah . 
A: Yeah, and that we found Œ well, maybe from 
Poland
 we had some, you know. 
Q: Okay , so tell me about how you le
arned that you could leave the camp . 
A: Amnesty came. Amnesty, in July 30, 1941. 
Q: Did you hear about it s
oon, the Œ in Œ on July 3
rd
, or it Œ that™s when it was given 
in the 
United States
? 
A: I don™t know how we heard, but we 
heard, and then  that™s why the man from 
deep, from the woods there, 
that my  brother Œ wh ere wa
s my  broth Œ they were 
coming because they say th-t
hey don™t have any 
jobs for them. So ev-everybody at 
ki Œ in th e camp didn™t Œ lost their jobs. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And people didn™t had money, they run 
out of what they have money. So  that™s 
why, you know Œ and th en in Œ when they
 Œ my  brother heard about the Po lish army  
forming, you know, then, like 
she told you about the few, 
those boys in his age, and 
older men, one or mo re, they join and we
nt Œ left us. And that™s what, you know, 
you have your in formation there. 

Q: Okay . And do you rememb er leaving the camp?

A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Tell me about that. 

A: I know that the sleds came, but my 
mo m wasn™t pack , and she felt Œ she has 
premonition, bad premonition no
t to leave, you know. And 
she didn™t want to leave 
the baby there, either, yo
u know. And we beg 
her, and she just was walking forth 
and back. And then  one man 
that was nice to us, you kn
ow, that many times helped, 
I think, with the trunk and 
things like that. He came and start hel Œ putting things, 
packing and taking to sled. But 
our mom didn™t want to leave. 
Q: She didn™t want 
to leave the camp? 
A: No. Something Œ sh e felt that ba
d things will happen, something. 
Q: Isn™t that Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay . 

A: I think sh e Œ she had, few times, you know
, she mentioned, th at came true later 
on. 

Q: But eventually
 she did leave? 
A: Yes.

Q: And where did you go? 
A: Oh, to the first Œ that™s when we coul
d Œ we Œ all of us couldn™t ride. My mo m 
could, and I don™t know if one of Œ that bo
th of us couldn™t ra Œ ride. I think the 
horses was probably very tired
, or something. And so, like 
my sist er says, we were 
walking, and one Œ I don™t kn
ow if which day was that, if
 that™s as first or second 
day. We wanted my mom not 
to worry, so we thought we
 will run ahead of the Œ all 
the Œ those sleds. So we ran, ran, ran, un
til we couldn™t see them. Then we got cold, 
and we waited, you know fo r them to 
come. And next mo rning, I woke up, I 
couldn™t stand up on my  feet, my  legs swe ll all the way here, like big, you know. So 

my  mo m had to carry me, and she, you kn
ow, she shouldn™t heavy Œ lift me at all. 
And so she begged th at lady that was driv
ing, if she could Œ one mo re person could 
get the ride. So she Œ so mething she gave
 her that finally she agreed. So I was 
sitting and my sister was wa
lking behind. And in the s
now, to walk, that™s not 
picnic. 
Q: No. 
A: It™s very Œ and those Œ when  you ride, 
that™s so many sleds, and that ro Œ the 
snow froze, and that makes that 
special noise when our sn Œ in 
Chicago
 we get 
below z Œ zero. When I went to feed my bird
s, when I walk, that™s the noise my feet 
was making. It™s special, that noise, you know.

A: And you hear all that noise that, 
you know, because so many sleds riding. 
Anyway, so then on, 
my sister Œ and then from tim
e to time my mo
m will exchange 
her, you know. 
Q: So Œ but Œ but basically Œ basically yo
u were able to now ride, but your mo m 
would so metimes let y our sister sit further Œ 

A: Yeah, because she felt so 
sorry for my sister, and my 
sister felt sorry for my 
mo m, you know. And I felt sorry 
for both of them, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And I felt guilty sitting there. 

Q: What could you do? 

A: Yeah, I know. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 What could you do? And so  eventu ally you reached wh at 
place? 
A: Oh, the first Œ

 to Œ I don™t know was
 Volo gda
 first big stop, I think. 
And because Germans were fighting close to 
Moscow
, that™s why they didn™t know 
which way the train should go. They planned the way we came, they brought us to 

Siberia
 around 
Mo scow
. So they went Œ wait until th
ey got orders, and so every 
day they  were telling us, we are leaving, 
we are leaving, okay. And then wh en  they 
really took us, that we we

with two guys, and they are just Œ one tim
e, there were persons
 sitting on the bench, 
was dead, frozen. So th ey just pick him up, throw on 
the sled, and keep going, and Œ 
but that we witness. And you never forget 
that. So Œ and then 
one Œ when  we were 
still on the sled, I think going that way, ba
 Œ to the freedom, some Œ when we came 
to one station, and big noises were ca Œ 
so meb ody  was mak i n g .  So my  Œ  ou r mo m 
went to si Œ when  they came

happy. But then he 
changed the tracks, and took off. And was just

I told the Mothers 
Provincial that I would like to leave Œ a

ey would renew the 
vows. Now that I wanted to leave, I left in the evening, withou
t any get permission, 
nothing, because you make vows for one 
year. And ev ery year you renew, if you
