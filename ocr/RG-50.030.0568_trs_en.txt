Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu

Anita Graber Œ 
Answer: 
An ita Graber. 
Q: Œ conducted by 
Ina Navazelskis
, held on March 2
nd
, 2010 at 
Leisure World, 
Silver Sprin g, Ma ry land. 
Thank you Œ 
A: You™re very welcome. 
Q: Œ Mrs. 
Graber, 
for coming to speak with us. Co
uld you tell me a little bit about 
your early life? You Œ when  you were born,
 where you were born, your parents, 
their names, where they came fro
m, how they made their living. 
A: Well, I Œ I was born in
 Berlin
 in 1925, October 29
th
, and my  parents were 
Elias 
Olejer
, he was born in August of ni
ne Œ 1894, and my  mo ther 
Cesia 
Abra mska
(ph) from 
Warsaw
 also, born in June of 1900
. Interestingly enough, my 
mo ther was the youngest of nine, my  dad 
was the youngest of six. And one of his 

older brothers, I have photographs, marr
ied one of my  mo ther™s older sisters. 
However, on Œ my dad would 
go once af Œ when the f-first World War was over, he 
went to Œ he decided he
 was going to go to 
Germany
. He didn't w ant to go to 
New 
York.
 He did want to go where the weather 
was Œ wh ere they would have winter, 
because he was i-in the fu
r business. He ended up as a furrier, and he made his

[speaks German]
, he became a master furrier in
 Berlin. 
I have his diploma 
hanging on the wall i-in
 my apartment.  
Q: When they were still in
 Warsaw
, what was the language they spoke? 
A: They spoke Polish. They  spoke Polis
h and Yiddish, and Œ and also some 
Russian, because at that Œ one
 point, the Russians were there, and that during the 
first World War, the Germans were in Œ were in 
Warsaw
. My mother™s father died 
when  she was two years old, in 1902. He
r father was one of three brothers, the 
Abra mski
(ph) brothers, 
Hainoch
(ph), 
Mendel
, and 
Pesa ch
(ph). 
Ha ino c h
(ph) and 
Mendel
 were the 
Florsheim
(ph) of
 Poland. 
And there was still a Œ a record of 
them, who™s who in  business in 1939 in
 Europe
. And they were listed, and they 
were a corporation. They 
brought their machinery in 
Manchester 
and in  
Germ any
. 
They  had tanneries, and they ha
d factories. They also sol Œ 
sold out of that Œ one of 
the brothers, 
Mendel Abra mski™s
(ph) house, my mother 
worked there, because 
when her father died, he was a contractor for them. 
Q: What was their company name? 

A: Of Œ oh,
 Abramski
(ph) shoes.  
Q: 
Abra mski
(ph) shoes 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 in Polish 
Q: Okay . 
A: Yes, 
Abramski
(ph) shoes and Œ and Œ an d they 
were well known, and they  had 
stores in Œ in
 Wa rsa w
 and in th e provinces, and th ey also had people that went onto 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568

the road to sell shoes. And 
my mother, as I said, sold 
for them until she got married. 
And Œ and she™d met my  father on one of th
e trips, that he came Œ he went twice a 
year to see his mo ther and his siblings. 
And Œ and Œ and I guess they fell in love, 
and my  mother™s papers weren™t ready to go to 
Germany
, so they got married in 
Danzig, Gdansk
. And then sh e Œ her two uncles escorted her there, and they  had 
just a religious ceremony, they  did not ha
ve the civilian one, so th e uncles just 
whisked her back to
 Warsaw
. And so their marriage wa
sn™t consummated until she 
joined him about si
x weeks later in 
Berlin.
 And th at was 1924, and Œ Au gust 1924, 
and in October of ™25, I wa
s born. And I was a very di
fficult birth and Œ and I had 
asthma. And mo m Œ I th Œ I wasn™t sleeping and my  mo th er would carry me around 
all night. And my  father felt very badly fo
r her. So when, in 1926, there was a well 
known plastic surgeon, a Dr. 
Josef
(ph), who had practiced medicine during th e first 

World War, and some of his instruments were used throughout 
Euro pe
. And she 
went there to have a Œ to 
have a Œ a nose job, becaus
e when she was a little girl, 
during th e summer, and she was the youngest of nine, and sh e ran into a tree. And 

she had a prominent nose, I have my  mo the
r™s nose, but she broke the nose, she had 
a bump on her Œ o-on her nose, so he said
 she should go there and have her nose 
done. And my  mo ther would tell how she Œ 
when she went in there, there were 
young men with big ears, a
nd they came out with little shells. And there women and 
men who went in with huge noses, and they  came out with little s-snub noses. And 

women went in with 
humongous breasts, and came Œ the y  went in with brassier es 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568

and Œ and it was perfect. And my  mo ther sa
id her surgery was not a success. S h e 
remembered swallowing blood
 wh ile they threw chocolate into her mouth. And 
professor 
Jusef
(ph) wanted her to come back to do it over, and she said no, she 
would live with that. So, I ha
ve my mother™s nose, and 
then in Œ when we were 
already in 
New York
, I was 16 years old, and I want
ed  to have my  nose done and 
my  mo ther would say 
[sp e a ks G e rm an ]
, the nose isn™t that important. And then 
when I got married and I suggested this to
 my husband, I said
, I married you not 
because of your nose, and yo
u don™t have to Œ so, here 
I am. I have Œ my son has 
my  nose. 
Q: Abso lutely beautiful. 
A: So, my  mo ther was Œ had been doing sales, so when  she came to 
Berlin
, she Œ 
she became his sales p erson, and he Œ and he
 was a Œ he was a very talented furrier. 
And his family had determined 
that that™s what he should
 be, you know, they Œ they 
Œ and he™d  gone to a ch  Œ what was called a 
chayder
, wh ich was a Œ a d Œ a very 
Orthodox kind of education an
d he hated it. And he th ought very  highly of German 
education, and that™s how come when I starte
d school in 1931 Œ of
 course, I went to 
a German school, a 
Volksschule
, and in 19 Œ my  brother 
was born in 1930, and in  
1936, he started the 
Volksschule
. And Œ and by 1936, I entered the first 
Bismarck 
Lyzeum,
 which was in 
Berlin
, it™s right near where the tennis courts were.

Q: You know what™s in Œ 
sounds interesting Œ I™m sorry
 for interrupting at this 
point, but it sounds like you went from bei
ng a Polish Jewish family, to a German 
Jewish family. 
A: Not really. 

Q: No. 

A: Because the German Je
ws really di-did not Œ 
Q: Accept? 

A: Œ n-no, they Œ they  Œ they Œ they  
Œ they did not accept. Th-Those eastern 

European Jews were different, and most of the 
[indecipherable]
 east European 
Jews lived in east 
Berlin
, 
Grenadierstrasse, 
etcetera, etcetera. 
And I Œ and Œ and 
so I never Œ I was never there. I Œ my  life w Œ was around the Œ th e parks, the 

[indecipherable] 
park, 
Olivaer Platz
, and every Sunday I went to the zoo with the 
Œ with the 
mädchen
 and my  brother. And Œ 
Q: Who did you socialize with then? 

A: Really, no one. I would a Œ my  brother wa
s lucky, he started 
school in ™36 and Œ 
and my  mother was called to school that 
he wasn™t doing well. And then they  Œ and 
when  you went to school in Œ in 
Germany
, the teachers came  to you, you didn™t go 
Œ you didn't change classes, and yo Œ the 
teacher ca Œ you remained except for gym 
and Œ and lunch.  

Q: In the same classroom? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568

A: In the same classroom. An
d when the Œ so the teacher 
said he wasn™t doing his 
best. However, he said to my  mo ther, I had gro Œ excellent do Œ 
[indecipherable]
 
an d  my  moth er said , 
was bedeutet das?
 What does that mean
? He says, when  the 
teacher comes in, your 
son jumps up and yells 
heil Hitler
 the loudest. Because Œ 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Œ the thing he really want
ed, the thing he really want
ed was to be like those little 
boys, wear a Œ wear Œ wear a uniform, a-and 
wear boots. He would take a Œ take his 

ice cream money, an d bought himself an 
[indeciphera ble]
. This was to support Œ 
this was to support the National Socialist Œ 
Q: Oh my  gosh. 
A: Yes, yes Œ 

Q: Oh my God. 

A: Œ he Œ you see, it Œ the Œ 
Q: This is to Œ in memory
 of Œ on my  school days 
[German]
 
mein kruzheit
(ph). 
A: 
Kreuzheit
(ph), yes. 
Q: And he was how old here? 

A: He was six years old. 
Q: Old. And his name? 

A: He was six Œ 
Peter.  
Q: 
Peter. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568

A: 
Peter Leo Olejer
. And Œ and so my  mo ther yanke
d him out immediately and put 
him into a Jewish school, 
Fasson
(ph) 
Strasse Schule
. And th at™s where they ended 
Œ ended up having, ev en tho
ugh they destroyed the syna
gogue, but that™s where Œ 
where they met, 
Jüdisch gemein de 
would meet there. And 
Peter 
went to that 
school. 
Q: The Jewish community, yeah. 
A: Yeah, until Œ until we left, ™39. 
Q: It™s quite Œ I mean, th-there are lots of
 questions as you™re talking that Œ that 
come to mind, and I will come
 to some of them later. Bu
t right now, one of those 
that Œ that strikes me is, that school was 
allowed Œ a Jewish school was allowed to 
exist, and Œ from ™36 to ™39. 
A: Oh, they Œ they existed un
til I Œ even in ™39, now they 
Œ they threw me out of the 
Drusen
(ph) 
Bismarck Lyzeum
 after
 Kristallnacht. 
I went Œ I went to that Œ I was 
the only Jewish child in that school, and 
I was permitted to be there because I was 
considered a Polish citizen. You see, I wa
s never a German ci Œ my brother and I, 
we were always Polish citizens. We™re
 on my  parents™ passports. I™m on my  
mo ther™s, and Œ and my  brother is on my  fa
ther™s. And that™s why our Œ the visas to 
come to the 
United States 
were in here. 
Q: Oh, I see, I see. 
A: Ah Œ but Œ and you can se
e that my parents went regu
larly back Œ each one went 
twice a year home to see thei
r families. And Œ and so that
 presented no problem, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
10
 
 
that was fortunate we came out as a un
it. We went Œ we were on the Polish quota 
numbers, we Œ 
Peter 
and I were not on the German quota. 
Q: So you weren't considered
 Jews, as much as Poles? 
A: We were considered Poles, we were 
considered Po lish. Ho wever, interestingly 
enough, 
Kristallnacht,
 thi Œ that Œ that happened at night, a-and Œ and then th ey 
said in the morning, the ru
mor started that they were 
coming to the apartments. So 
my  parents Œ 
Q: Did it affect the store, the business? 

A: Oh, th e store di Œ of course. And how 
did they know? How di
d they know that it 
was a Jewish shopkeeper and not a Chri
stian one? How would they  know that? 
Because 
Ro senba ch
(ph),
 Greenbach
(ph),
 Silber
(ph),
 Weiss,
 
Brown, Schwarz,  
Scharzman 
Œ 
Q: They could be German names too. 
A: They Œ they were Ge
rman names, they Œ thos
e were German names. 
Zimmerman
. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: They were occupation, th
ey were color, they were an
imals. And ea Œ I think in 
™37, it was after the Olympic games in ™37,
 every Jewish shopkeeper had to take a 
middle name. If it was a ma le, his middle name was
 Israel
, so my father was 
Elias 
Israel Olejer
. If it was a woman, her middle name was 
Sara h. 
And so it would 
have been
 Cesia Sarah Olejer.
 That™s how they knew. An
d it had to be so and so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
11
 
 
many centimeters up from the floor, and so  ma Œ in Œ in certain height of letters, in 
white. And that™s Œ that™s how th ey kne
w who was Jewish and who was not. This 
was plan Œ planned a long time ago,
 but they used 
the incident in 
Paris
 to do th at 
because the mother called Œ called this a Œ 
it is Œ he was 18 years old, called him in 
Paris, 
she said, I™m so upset, 
they took Dad
dy away overnight, and I™m so 
frightened. 
Q: What incident in 
Paris 
are you talking about, just for our listeners. Excuse me 
for a second. 
A: That™s all right.
 
Q: Okay , mm-hm. 

A: When  Œ when  the mo  Œ what had happened was, my  13
th
 birthday was October 
29
th
, 1938, the night of October 28
th
 or the 29
th
, they rounded up all Polish Jewish 
males  
[indecipherable]
 because you always listed with the Œ with the police 
department. 
Q: Right. 

A: I mean, you do th at throughout 
Europe. 
Q: Of course. 

A: They know exactly where 
you are. And they shipped them off to no man™s land, 
the Œ 
Pozen [indecipherable]
.
 
And the Œ the Germans wa
nted them to go into 
Poland
 and 
Poland 
didn™t want them, cause they were
 just Polish Jews. And so for 
awhile they remained th
ere, in no man™s land. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
12
 
 
Q: Your father amongst them? 
A: No, for some reaso n  th
ey overlooked my
 father. And all his friends were 
involved, everybody he knew 
was am Œ they overlooked him, because of the name? 
I have no id ea. He went to the Gestapo the 
next day, to say, I have witnesses that I 
was home. I did not try to hide. So  he remained. He was the only man among all my  

parents™ friends that Œ that lived in west
 Berlin
. All their friends lived in west
 
Berlin
. So Œ 
Q: Can I clarify that though, for a 
second? Their friends
 lived in west 
Berlin
, but 
you said that they didn't really 
have friends amongst German Jews. 
A: No, they were all Polish Jews. 

Q: So were they Polish Jews? Polish Jews. 

A: They were all Polish Jews. They were from 
Lódz
 and they were from some of 
the smaller cities, 
Kraków
, and Œ and they were from 
W a rsaw. [indecipherable]
 
Q: I see. 

A: And my parents had no relatives living in 
Berlin
, they Œ 
Q: When  Œ when  you were at home, wh
at was your language that you spoke? 
A: German. 

Q: German. 

A: We spoke German. And they had be
friended Œ my mother was a horrendous 
cook. Sh e™d be Œ she never learned how to
 cook because her mo
ther lived with Œ 
with a ma Œ with a married, an older 
married daughter, and my  Œ and my  mo ther. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
13
 
 
And Œ an -and so  my  mo ther never learne
d how to cook, and she was a very bad 
co ok . An d  my  mo th er sa
id that the first six 
weeks they were in 
Berlin
, every day 
she made chicken, boiled chicken with Œ w
ith something, the oats, or what have 
you, and Œ and boiled lima 
beans. I remember them, I™d
 Œ I swear it™s one of the 
reasons I got married, to get away from that
 Friday night dinner. Bu t she made that 
every day fo r six weeks. So
 my father said, that™s 
schon genug
. They Œ 
Q: It™s enough already. 
A: Yeah, and th ey befriended a German Jewish woman, 
Tante Lily Finkelstein
. 
And she was married to a Polish Jew, and th
e Œ but a Œ they were
 only married like 
a 
morganatic 
marriage, that™s 
[indecipherable]
. Was only a sib Œ a religious 

ceremony, and they  had a daughter 
Margot
, and she became my best friend. And 
my father was doing quite well in busine
ss, in this Œ in 
the 20s. And they Œ 
Tante 
Lily
 would cook for my parents, a
nd my father maintain ed her and 
Margot
 in  an  
apartment nearby. And why Œ why did I tell you this? And so , my  mo ther Œ 

Q: I was asking about who your parents friends were. 

A: Well, they were friends with people th
ey  met through business, and Œ and going 
to balls. They were Œ 
Berlin
 in the 20s was Œ was the in place. And there™s a very 
funny story, one of my
 mother™s cousins from 
Warsaw, 
a
 Tadeusz Abramski
(ph). 
He was Uncle 
Hainoch™s
(ph) son. And he came to visit them in 
Berlin
, and they 
took him to this nightclub, and he was da ncing with th is woman, and he Œ he was 

wining and dining her andbuying her champagne and wh
at have you. And my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
14
 
 
parents™ friend said to my  mo ther, when  ar e you going to tell him that this is not a 
woman, that this is a man? And when
 Tadeusz
 heard Œ found out, he was livid. He 
didn't  forgive her for many years. Your Œ 

Q: What a story. 

A: That was 
Berlin 
in the 20s. 
Q: Of course it was. 
A: But that was 
Berlin Œ 
Q: 
Christopher Isherwood
, and  
A: Well, yeah, a-a-and Œ 

Q: 
Sally Bowles. 
A: That™s right, and Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ and cabaret. And Œ and my mother wo
uld go dancing to th e Œ I forget where 
that was, it was near Café 
Tso
(ph). Near, near
 Ba rnho f
(ph) so Œ 
Q: 
Kansla Œ Kransla
, something Œ 
A: No, at Œ at 
Kansla
(ph) we used to go ev ery night when we were in 
Berlin. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We went to the 
Kansla
(ph) to have dessert. 
Q: Yes, they have wonderful desserts. 
A: And Œ and Œ wonderful desse
rts. And Œ and Œ and you wo
uld sit at a table, and 
you had a telephone, and a ge
ntleman would ask her to 
dance, and sh e would get 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
15
 
 
up. And she did that with her girlfriends, you know, she took a couple of hours off 
from Œ from the store that way. And Œ an
d that was the way life was i-in Œ in 
Berlin. 
Q: Did you have any friends 
who were German Gentiles? 
A: No, no, none, none. None at all. I Œ th
e only time I dis Œ they associated with me, 
I was very good in Œ in foreign language, 
I th Œ my  father decided that hopefu lly, 
when we left, we would be able to get to the 
United States. 
And so he Œ he Œ he 
determined that I should take English first,
 and then French. I st
arted French  in 30 Œ 
in ™39, April ™39, the school year was alwa
ys in Ap ril, and then
 we were off for a 
month during th e summer. And so I Œ I took En
glish. And th at Œ and I was good in 
English, and I was a very good stu Œ a-athl
ete. My dad t Œ my  dad taught me how to  
swim, he taught me ice skating, taught me
 to ice skate an d so forth and so  on. So, 
that™s the only time I really associated
 with them. Nobody
 talked to me. 
Q: So this is something I™d like to fi
nd out mo re about. You started a German 
school Œ 

A: Yes, until Œ 
Q: Œ in 1930? 
A: 1931. 

Q: Œ oh Œ ™31. And Œ 
and you™re the only Je
wish girl in 1939 who™s in there, who™s 
at that school. 

A: Thi Œ ™38 
[indecipherable]
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
16
 
 
Q: In ™38. 
A: Yeah, when Œ when Œ with 
Kristallnacht 
they threw me out, 
and there was ad Œ 
at the ca Œ at the Œ the 
Adolf Hitler Platz
, not far from the 
[German]
 there was a 
Jewish school, called the 
Tiera
(ph )  
Ha tzo
(ph) 
schule
, and I went to that one, 
because that was closest to wh
ere we lived, and the others 
were all east. And then in 
April of ™39, they decide
d the German Œ Jewish scho
ol should no
t be in the 
Adolf 
Hitler Platz. 
That™s a desecration, so they clos
ed that one, and I went to the 
Vietsnakaho
(ph) 
schule
, which was east. And I had to
 go th ere by subway , and I 
went there until summer vacation bega
n, June of ™39, and June 20
th
, 1939, we were 
called to the American Œ well, we Œ in 
Berlin
 it was the embassy, not the city™s, it 
was the consulate. You no long
er waited ti-ti-til you went to 
Ellis Island,
 th at w a s 
closed, for your physical. 
And Œ and Œ and we were Œ 
and Œ and we Œ we got our 
quota, w-we got our visas. And Œ and my  
father in the meantime had wi Œ he Œ and 
his Œ he kept his business open until April 1
st
, 1939, that™s when he
 closed the store. 
T h ey  u s ed  to  co me 
through the back, Ch-C hristian, his Christian customers. And Œ 
and he was hoping. And it ope
ned up, we went June 20
th
, and he had already 
received an 
ausweis
, he had to leave 
Germany
 Œ 
Q: A passport. 
A: Œ yup, by August 31

Wa rsa w

had arranged for us to be smug

Q: Oh my  gosh. 
A: I mean, unbelievable, but who knew?
 And so we were very fortunate. 
Q: But smuggled  in which direction? If you™re going to  the 
United States

A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

But he had to  make arrangement
s to le Œ he had to leave 
Berlin
, he had to 
leave 
Germany
, or end up in a concen tration camp. 
Q: So, in  other word s, he was Œ he went to Œ to 
Poland
? 
A: He was going to  go to 
Poland
, but instead our quota 
number opened, and we Œ 
and we were coming to the Œ to 
New York
 on an American ship. They  had made 

arrangements right along, that if we were go
ing to leave, we were going to go with 

the 
SS Manhattan. 
It was the 
United States
 line. The manager of that office in 
Berlin 
was a 
Herr Hauptman
. I forget his first name. A
nd so  Œ but they wanted  to 
go via Œ instead of leaving from 
Ha mbu rg
, they wanted to leave from 
Le Havre
. 
And I™ll tell you why. 
Q: 
Belgium? 
Is that it? 
A: 
Le Havre
 is
 France. 
Q: Is
 France
, mm-hm. 
A: Is 
France. 
And it™s 
Hamburg
, 
Le Havre, Southampton, Cope
(ph), 
New Yo rk
. 
And Œ and so he need ed Œ they  need
ed Œ here they had valid visas, 
Paris Œ France,

new Œ and then 
New York.
 And my father Œ my moth
er went to the French 
embassy and they would not give them tr
ansit visas, because what was happening, 
people said oh, you know, we
™re going on to this place, 
that place, and they decided 
to stay in Œ in Œ in Œ in
 France.
 There were too many stateless people in Œ in
 
France
, and they wouldn™t give it to them, so
 my  parents were st Œ my dad had a 
reason, and I™ll explain that in awhile. And so
 he Œ he went Œ he 
went to Mr. Œ they 
went to Mr. 
Hauptman
(ph) and he said, stay here, I 
have a friend at the embassy. 
And he went, in half an hour 
he came back, four visas to 
Paris. 
And so when we 
left
 Berlin
 Œ 
Q: Now, was he a Gentile? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, he was Œ he was a Œ an American Œ German American or 

American German, whatever. But he was Œ 
was Christian. And Œ 
and Œ and we left 
July 31
st
 from 
Berlin
 and we arrived in
 Paris,
 August first. And we stayed there til 
August 10
th
, and then we came Œ we Œ we boarded the sh ip. I-In
 Le Havre
 there 
was a train that Œ that went directly to Œ 
to  the port, and Œ and all our luggage was Œ 
was put on board , and Œ an
d that was that. And Œ 
Q: I™d like to step back a little bit
. 
A: Yes? 

Q: And ask about two things. They™re diffe
rent, but I™ll ask them while they™re in 
my mind. The first is, your experien
ces from 1931 til 1938, being in that
 Lyzeum
, 
and what kind of thoughts yo
u have, if you can rememb er, what kind of interaction 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
19
 
 
there was with the other kids, or the teac
hers, or how, after 1933 perhaps, things 
changed, you know, with
 Hitler
 coming to  power. That™s one question. And the 
other one, I™d like to concentrate a little 
bit more on your father™s business and 
Kristallnacht. 
What specifically happen
ed  th ere? How did he re
build it? And if he 
kept it open for so long, was he able to sa
ve his assets, sell the business, or did he 
lose it all? So those two questions. 
A: Well, he Œ he had a Œ after awhile, a 
Christian clientele. One of them was a 
woman whose husband had an important position in 
Goebbels Œ 
Q: Ministry. 
A: Œ ministry. And she called him the afte
rnoon of Novemb er ninth, and she said, 
Herr
 
Olejer
, my  husband tells me that such and 
such  is going to  take place. He 
always had a window well dressed. He Œ an
d the lights stayed on
 til about 11:30, 12 
o™clock and then they automa
tically went off. He commande
ered a taxi, and he took 
out Œ he Œ he re Œ he redr
essed the window with inexpe
nsive things, and he emptied 
out his stock, and with the taxi, they we
nt back  and forth, our apartment was two 
blocks away, and they got everything into
 the apartment. And Œ and he had a, 
interestingly enough, he had a gate that
 was behind th e plate glass. And it had 
something th at you ro lled it up, it Œ very  heavy Œ 
Q: Oh, I remember th ose types of window shutters. 
A: Yeah, yeah, you needed 
special shears. A nd when th
ey Œ wh en  they broke the 
glass, they did not have the Œ 
the Œ the shears to cut Œ to 
cut the wires, so they went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
20
 
 
on. So th ey were never aware of what was 
in the back of the store or not. And Œ and 
so Œ and they didn™t come 
into our apartment.
 Ah Œ you know, when we thought Œ 
the rumor had it that we were going to be
 Œ they were going 
to come into the 
apartments, they never did. 
Q: So his losses were glass? 

A: Were glass. And of course, he had to 
replace that and Œ and Œ an d there was a Œ 
there was also a special tax for that, etcetera
, etcet Œ whatever he had to do, he did, 
and he reopened the store. But he wa
s hoping at some point to get out of 
New 
York
, so he would go to Œ he would go to Œ 
Q: Out of 
Berlin
, you mean.  
A: Out of
 Berlin.
 So he would go to Œ to  travel, 
and my mo ther would go to  Œ or he 
would go to travel agencies, 
and Œ and he was looking fo r Œ in
 South America
, at Œ 
where they have winter and summer, because
 you know, he was in the fur business. 
And the Œ and you n Œ 
you know what happened with
 the voyage of the damn ed, 
you know, that they Œ th
ey weren™t permitted  to la
nd, and they would say 
Herr 
Olejer, 
now it™s 2:15, what™s going to  be at th
ree o™clock, I really don™t know. And 
my  dad said, costs a lot of money to take 
a family of four, etcetera, etcetera, and 
without any guarantees, I rea
lly don™t know what to do. So
, in 1937, reme mb er that 
after the Russian revolutions, the white Ru
ssians, where were th
ey? They were in 
Berlin
, and they were in
 Paris. 
Q: That™s right, that™s right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
21
 
 
A: And they  had many, many connections wi
th the Œ with Œ among the diplomats. 
S o  my  m Œ  my  fath er s e n t  my  mo th er to  
Paris
 in 1937. Sh e had an aunt who Œ and a 
husband and family, and th ey went to 
Paris
 from
 Warsaw
, and Œ right after the first 
World War. And they opened a furniture f
actory. Sh e had a first cousin from the 
Warsaw
 area who went to 
Paris
 after the first
 
World War, and she opened a 
knitting factory. So my dad sent my mother to 
Paris
 to see both relatives, to as Œ 
because he didn™t want to ha
ve to wait too long to find ou
t if what he was going to 
send out, wh en Œ would the 
Œ would Œ would arrive in 
New Yo rk
, because by th en 
we already had a quota number from my  mo
ther™s oldest sister who lived in 
New 
York, 
she couldn™t support a d Œ a Œ a mouse.
 And this is the height of the 
depression here. But we had 
the quota number, the low q
uota number, that™s Œ that 
was our saving grace. It was somebody else™s 
papers that enabled us Œ that he said 
he would Œ he was willing to su pport
 us. So he sent my mother to 
Paris
 to see both 
the aunt and the cousin. And he decided, to
 the aunt he wanted to  send fu r. To the 
cousin he would send money. Wh en the do
llar was two and a Œ with the Œ the dollar 
was two and a half ma rks, my  father paid 14
 marks for every dollar 
that he sent out. 
And that was sent to the cousin, and sh
e was Œ she opened up a 
safe deposit box so  
that when my parents, if
 they should get out Œ 
Q: They have Œ 
A: Œ they  could go and have money to get 
started with. To the aunt, she Œ since she 
had a huge factory, she was to get the furs. 
So what he would do is, he would throw 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
22
 
 
together 
[indecipherable]
 or Persian lamb , or mink or wh atever it was, or fox, 
almo st without destroying it, just it looke
d like Œ it Œ it Œ it looked like a coat or a 
jacket. And Œ and she would st Œ and th-the
 Œ the relative was gonna come and visit, 
was a Œ was a person by th e name of 
Shapsa
(ph). And my mother com Œ 
communicated with them in 
Polish Œ in Yiddish , that 
Shapsa
(ph) was coming to 
visit and he doesn™t know 
his way around, and will you 
please come and Œ and Œ 
and help him with his luggage and pick 
him up at Œ at Œ and 
pick him up at the 
station. So my  dad woul
d buy a train ticket from 
Berlin
 to
 Paris. 
That gave him 
permission to put a suitcase aboard the trai
n. He would do Œ and when no one came 
to pick it up, they 
put it into storage in
 Paris
. My mother would send a letter w ith 
the receipt and the key to the aunt and say,
 Sha psa ™ s
(ph) coming, and you know, he 
doesn ™t know his way around,
 would you help him with 
the luggage? And that™s 
how 14 suitcases were waiting 
for us when we came to 
Paris. 
And we came Œ we 
left August Œ July 31
st
, and w-we crossed the border at 
Aachen. 
We went via Œ via 
Belgium
 into 
Paris, 
and you could see the 
Magino t Line
 and you could see that 
they were massing on either side. You ha
d them on the French si Œ on th e Œ on the 
Belgian side, and you had them on Œ on Œ 
Q: So you were Œ you 
sensed war was coming? 
A: Well, that Œ you could s
ee it. You could see it, and Œ 
and Œ an d so we arrived in 
Paris
 Au gust first, and we had dinner that ni
ght at my Œ at my mother™s aunt and 
uncle, and they wined and di
ned us, and they were Œ ma
de arrangements to bring Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
23
 
 
have all the suitcases b rought to the sh
ip Œ train, when we left August 10
th
. And we 
were at a hotel, and the mam Œ Monday we
 saw the cousin, and Œ and by Tuesday 
mo rning my  dad said to the cousin™s husband, 
Mo n s ieur
, let™s go, and he said Œ 
meantime, the news had been terrible, comi
ng out of Œ the Œ y
ou know, they were Œ 
they were maneuvering, they 
were Œ they were Œ they Œ 
they were getting ready for 
war, and they had a shortage, they had a cas
h flow problem, and they didn™t think 
we™d ever get out. So it was invested in their busin ess, and th ere was no money. 
And my father said to my moth
er, you go with the children to 
New York
, I™m not 
doing th is here, I™m Œ you know. And my  mo th
er said, nothing doing. We™ve lost so 
much, we™ll lose some more. 
We have our lives. We™ll l
earn, and we™ll Œ and when  
you Œ and you have
 Œ you have th e furs
, and you™ll do the best you can. And she 
convinced him. So we Œ we left Œ we le
ft as a family and we arrived here. And 

interestingly enough, he took out Œ he took
 out all his machinery, etcetera, and it 
was put into a crate. And in order to fill it 
up, to Œ to secure things inside, he used 
old patterns. Not a nickel was charged fo
r all those suitcases with furs. Those 
patterns, that my  dad had to pay fo r. An
d was just funny, but he wa Œ he Œ 
Q: Who knew? 
A: No, who knew is right. 

Q: Who knew? But what Œ I mean, 
what foresight. What foresight Œ 
A: Well, you Œ you Œ 

Q: Œ to try and Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
24
 
 
A: A-And yo Œ there was a movie 
called, in ﬁThe Gard en s of 
Finzi-Continis.ﬂ 
Q: Yes, I remember. 
A: And rememb er, he was Œ he was ve Œ a very assimi lated Jew, and he traveled in 
the highest circles, with Œ 
with important people from 
It aly
. And he did not, 
whereas there were people in much lower 
segments of society, and th-the Œ th e 
young men, in order to protect
 them, they Œ they went to 
Switzerland
 to see what 
they could do, because they 
saw it coming, you know? To 
send their families out, to 
save them. He didn™t, he was Œ you know, 
he Œ he said, they would never touch me, 
because look who I am. And look, I™m trav
eling in the highest circle. And that™s 
what happened to so me peop
le. One of our neighbors in 
Berlin
, he had been in the 
first World War, he still had hanging 
over his couch, his a Œ his sword Œ 
Q: Iron cross. 
A: Œ a-and Œ and his helmet, 
and Œ and Iron Cross. And he said to my  father, July 
1939, I don™t understand it. You east
ern European Jews
, you can go to 
No rth 
America
, and we German Jews, 
we can only go to 
Shanghai. 
And he had a 20 year 
old son, and an 18 year old 
daughter, and he wouldn™t let them go, and I™m sure 
they were all destroyed. 

Q: Oh my. 

A: So they went Œ this is 
July of ™39, and they were 
still thinking in those terms. 
Q: How tragic. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
25
 
 
A: And Œ and Œ and with
 everything else that took place, to go to 
Sha ng ha i
, 
Stalin
 
permitted Jews to cross 
Russia. 
Q: 
Siberia. 
A: 
Siberia, 
to get to 
Shanghai
. And th ey Œ and th e Japanese treated those German 
Jews, and Jews very well. My mo ther Œ my  father had a Œ had a customer who 
ended up in Œ in 
New York 
aft Œ into Œ after 
Shanghai.
 She had a son in
 England
, 
so when  we stopped in 
Southampto n, 
he had Œ he had jewelry 
for her, that he gave 
to the son, and a ta Œ and a Œ and a bicycl
e. And the son came to the shi Œ came to 
the ship and took that. And when Mrs. 
Turash
(ph) ended up in 
New York
, and she 
came to see my parents to thank them for 
whatever it is they 
had done. She said 
when she got to Œ she was 
a handsome woman, she was 
a divorcee and she had one 
son who lived in 
Eng land
 already. And Œ and she ha
d a Œ a boyfriend who was a 
memb er of the, I guess, Gesta
po. And he helped her get to 
Shanghai
, and sh e Œ 
when  she get Œ and she was a handsome lady
. And she said she was telling the story 
when  the Œ when  the war broke out, what Œ 
wh at he said to her. I could like you. Do  
you sleep single? That™s how sh e word ed it, 
that™s what he said to her. I could like 
you, do you Œ do you sleep si
ngle? I™ll never forget that, I 
thought it was so funny, I 
was Œ happened to be there when  Œ wh en
 she Œ when she word
ed it that way.  
Q: 
Schule Œ schulzeit
, your school days. Because the 
first part, you ha Œ the second 
question, I think you clarified for me, how 
your father was able to at least save 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
26
 
 
something, what he did, ho
w mu ch damage was done from
 Kristallnacht.
 And it Œ 
it sounded very scary. 
A: But Œ but life went on. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: It went on, and as the German Jews 
had to Œ had to reduce their overhead and 
move into smaller quarters, my father 
had a friend, a German Jewish friend wh o 
was in ant Œ in ana Œ in antiques. And he
 to ok him and co nvinced him to buy two 
sets of china. One was a 
Limoges
 service for 24, a
nd one was a German 
Furstenberg
 tea and coffee service for 20, and he
 bought that, and he brought that 
and it came a Œ some of it that was not broken, and some of Œ course, some stuff 

was broken. And Œ and I have it here, and I had Œ 

Q: Oh my. 

A: It™s from Œ yeah, it Œ it Œ it Œ th Œ 
my  Œ my  son already has half, and my  
daughter, she™s not prepared to
 take that, because it™s Œ it™s with 22 karat gold, and 
you have to hand wash that, 
you can™t put that into a dishwasher, and then th e dryer. 
So, that™s here. The furniture
 was left there, we didn™t bring any fu rniture, he just 
brought his machinery. 

Q: And what about the business itself? 

A: The business he just closed. 
Q: He just closed the door.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
27
 
 
A: He just closed the door, and Œ and 
that was that. And th
en when we left, 
everything had to be in quadr
uplicate, so my mother hire
d a secretary to do that. 
Every handkerchief, every pair
 of stockings had to be listed in quad ruplicate. And 
in the middle of the packing, the Gesta
po, tw o guys came from the Gestapo, they 
wouldn™t even take a drink, nothing. 
They  Œ they watched one another. In the 
middle of that we had an air raid, and Œ 
and everybody had to 
go down into the 
basement. And then  they finished packing.
 Somebody complained there was a lot of 
noise, and Œ and Œ and Œ and these 
two guys, with yelling, you know, 
[indecipherable]
 from 
Himmler
, 
Judens an raus. 
And this is one way of getting 
them out. 

Q: In order of hit Œ of 
Hitler Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Œ 
Himmler Œ  
A: Yeah, to g Œ to get out. 
Q: From the air raid shelter? 

A: The Œ the Œ well, i Œ  
Q: Oh, from Œ  
A: Œ once the air raid was over, but you 
know, that™s now br
ought it into the 
evening Œ 
Q: Okay . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
28
 
 
A: Œ because it was getting dark er, even  though it was Œ it was July. And Œ and 
every Sunday, ma Œ our favorite place was to go to  the 
Jones
 beach of 
Berlin,
 
which was 
Wannsee. 
Q: That™s right, that™s right.  

A: And when we went in ™88, I took th em there, on the 
[indecipherable]
 to show 
them 
Wannsee
, and it happened  to have been  a beautiful day, there were people out 
sailing. And next day, I think th ere was 
some  snow. And Œ and that™s where, of 

course, they had the final solution, in one 
of the villas. And Œ and the other favorite 
place, of course, was the zoo, we went 
there every Sunday. That was my favorite 
place, and there was a very well known gorilla in 
Berlin
, he was known as the 
gorilla
 Bobb y, Bobby. 
And he died in 30-something. A
nd when  we went in ™88, we 
went to the zoo, and we
 went in through the 
[indecipherable]
 tour. And then we 
ended up the last thing we 
saw were the primates, and my  children started yelling, 
Mom, Mom, come here. And there was Œ a
nd I have it Œ I have Œ I have a country 

house that I™m no longer going to because 
my  husband is on a walk er now. And you 
see me  looking at the statue, and th
ey photographed me looking at the Œ 
Q: 
Bobby? 
A: 
La Bobby
, yes, yeah, beautiful, a beautiful statue
 to him. I think he died in ™36. 
And Œ and I became furious all 
over again when I was in the zoo. It was so clean. 
The cages were clean, the anim
als were well taken care o
f. And I said, look at this. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568

Look what they™ve 
done for the Œ an-and 
they do nothing, 
nothing fo r human 
beings. So difficult. So Œ 
Q: Tell me about school. 
A: Well, school was difficult, but my father
 thought so highly of German education, 
that he didn™t want to hear about it, and 
so I stayed, I Œ you know, I was Œ I was Œ I 
was the firstborn and I did what I was to

rebellion.  

Q: What was ti Œ tell me, you were Œ I me

years old wh en it started. So  wh at are your first me mo ries of school? 
A: I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it, I Œ I enjoyed th e structure of it, I Œ and 
Tante Lily,

Q: Œ essay. 
A: Œ an essay. And Œ and, so certain things
 I did, and other thin

Q: Were you lonely? 

A: Oh yes, yes, I was lonely. I was lo Œ

Q: I mean in school. 
A: Œ and Œ and record s. And

Hebrew, it™s very funny.  

Q: At school, did yo
u have any friends? 
A: No, no, no. I Œ I had Œ I went to a Œ

Q: Did you like it? 

A: Oh, very mu ch. And I learned to eat foods

Q: So, what were those conversations like 
with your father, when you said, school 
is difficult, and he said, you still have to go. 
A: That™s right. Th-That Œ that was Œ 
you just didn™t Œ you Œ you did not Œ 

Q: Did you give him examples of what was going on? 
A: He Œ he didn't  want to hear that. He

forget, they Œ they 
belonged to those groups, and 
Œ and th ey told  stories about their parents, that was 
one of the things, these children were sent 
Œ were sent to the country. They Œ you 
know, 
Kraft durch Freude.
  
Q: Yeah. 
A: Strength through joy. Th
ey Œ they did things for th
em that they hadn™t had, 
because in the 20s, whatever
 they™d had, disappeared. So
, for them this was great. 
And heh Œ we went to some 
Hatorah,
 my  brother and I and the maid. And she sat

upstairs and 
Peter 
and I were downstairs, and we had,
 in order to cross, to get to 
this particular synagogue, 
Mussolini
 had come to visit, a
nd there was a parade, and 
we had to  wait so we could cross. And Œ 
and they handed us 
the flags, so my 
brother starts yelling 
[speaks German]
. Well, they grabbed him, and 
[indecipherable]
 up on top, she wouldn™t acknowl
ed ge that she had anything to do 
with him, and I was ashamed and embarrasse
d, and they finally read him the riot 
act, and he calmed down. And the leading c
hocolatiers were a
ll Je ws, so we had 
wonderful, wonderful candies. I remember b e
ing there in ™88, and I walked into the 
store and I saw this Œ that I used to be wild about, it was a walnut 
englazed 
in Œ it Œ 
it was pro Œ 

Q: In chocolate? 

A: No, sugar. 

Q: Oh, sugar. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 in sugar. I bought Œ when  I sa
w that I went crazy, I wouldn™t 
even share it with my  family
. I bought everything he ha
d. The next day he Œ we 
went back  and we bought Œ I 
bought mo re. I broke, I think, I think I broke a bridge 
that time. And Œ and going in to 
[indecipherable]
 upstairs, the food, I think 
[indecipherable]
 can Œ can Œ can Œ 
Q: Exactly, exactly. 

A: It was fabulous, abso lutely fabu
lous, we had such a good time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568

Q: Yeah. So it Œ it sounds, from a child™s pe
rspective, if we take Œ if we take 
everything that™s political out of 
it, extraordinarily bittersweet. 
A: Yes, it is, it is. I remember once Œ once 
th ey already had the Œ you could rent a 
chair by the hour, and they we
re yellow with a yu Œ with a 
J, Jude
. And you could 
Œ or Œ or you™d sat on a bench that was yellow, and it said, 
J, Jude
. You sat Œ you 
had to sit on those benches. We just woul
d sit down, th e kids that I hung around 
with in 
Olivaer Platz
. And I remember being in 
Olivaer Platz
, and a Œ an-and a 
[indecipherable] 
went over to Œ to two men, they  were sitting on a green bench. 
And now the axis had begun, you know, and
 Italy 
and 
Germany
 were like this. 
And they assumed that they were Jewish, 
but they were Italian. And they to ok out 
their passports to show that
 they had made a mistake. 
And th en there was a very 
well known ice cream parlor 
around the corner from where 
Olivaer Platz
 was 
known as 
Ballza
(ph), they had delicious ice 
cream. They ended up in 
Tel Aviv
, 
having Œ but their children were no longer in
terested in it, so wh
en  the parents died 
Ballza
(ph) went off the air. They have 
an ice cream group th ere called Dr. 
Lek
, 
l-e-
k
, that™s very funny. 
Q: 
Lekka
(ph). 
A: Yeah. 
Q:

 delicious Œ 
A: Just a Je wish Œ

Q: In this time, there™s so many 
Berlin
 memo ries, but you say that every year, your 
parents would go back to 
Warsaw
 to visit family. Did you ever join them? 
A: Oh, absolutely. I went Œ I 
went several ti mes. I  was in 
Warsaw
 Œ the last time I 
was in 
Warsaw
 was Christmas of ™37.  
Q: And how did y
ou feel being in 
Warsaw
? 
A: Well, I Œ I had co usins, and that™s 
was wonderful. And one of my  mo ther™s 
favorite cousins from Œ from the Œ from the 
Abra mski
(ph) family, they took me to 
a restaurant a-at Œ I never saw pious Jews 
with the Œ with the beards, and wh at have 
you, an-and special 
kipas
. So, she wanted them to ha
ve Yiddish German Œ what 
would I like to eat, and I pointed there, and it was 
der Weihnachts-Mann ist.
 And 
that Œ that be Œ and everybod
y knew that this is what 
I™d said, I™m Œ  I™m Œ I mu st 
have been, you know, ma
ybe it was 1933 - 1934. 
Q: And you asked for the Ch ristmas man. 
[in d ecipherable]
 
A: Yeah, whatever the Ch
ristmas man was ea ting, th
at™s what I wanted. And 
whether it was roast duck, or roast goose.
 And Œ and I enjoyed being Œ I enjoyed 
being, you know, that that was family. 
Q: Did you feel Œ did you Œ if you comp are the Œ 
did you feel at home in 
Berlin
, or 
feel at home in 
Warsaw
? 
A: I felt at home in
 Berlin. 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
35
 
 
A: That is Œ so that™s Œ you
 know, that™s Œ that™s where I Œ that™s where I lived, and 
I didn™t know anything else. So that™s Œ 
Q: Did you speak Po lish? 
A: No. My  parents spoke Po lish in order 
for my  brother and me not to understand 
what they were talking about
. So, my mother had a stroke
 in ™74. My dad died in 
™65, he was 70. And my  mo ther turned 74 
in the hospital, and 
the few words that 
came back, she Œ she could swallow, she coul
d eat, but she couldn™t speak. The few 
words she babbled were in Polish, and my
 brother and I stood by like two dummies, 
and we didn't know wh at she wa
s talking about, of course. 
Q: It was her Œ it was the firs
t language of her childhood. 
A: Yeah, ab solu tely, and th at™s what come
s back. Fo r me to count and be accurate 
and fast, I count in German.  
Q: Yeah. So. Is there anything that I have
n™t asked, that you 
would like to add to 
this, or that you think is important to know? 

A: Well, not really. I™d Œ I™ve Œ I™ve come here from 
New York
, and I went to the 
Charles E. Smith
 school to talk to them wh at it was like to grow up in 
Germany
 as 
a Jewish child. I did that one day.  

Q: What were some of the 
questions the kids asked you? 
A: You know, how did I di-da 
Œ did ha Œ wh at it was Œ it Œ it Œ it™s hard for them to 
understand that Œ even that 
such a thing even exists. An
d it™s Œ for me, it™s difficult 
that Œ having met survivors and Œ and some
 of them are Œ are not telling the truth, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
36
 
 
either. They  Œ they  Œ th-they Œ they™re Œ 
the Œ they™re just not, they™re a Œ they™re 
imagining things, to a degree. 
Q: What kind of things would you mo re Œ 
A: They™re Œ they™re willing to testify that th
ey were in particular places, when be Œ 
they Œ they admitted 
to me they were not. There are people that don™t have numbers 
on th eir arms, that I met in 1949 - ™50, 
an d you couldn™t have been  to that many 
camps, and not have a number. So, it™s Œ and 
th-then Œ then also, I we Œ I went to 
the early 
Yom HaShoahs
, so the first ones that were in 
New York
, and Œ and 
everybody wanted to  be, you know, the fi
rst Œ well Œ well, if you come very late, 
you can™t sit in the first row, and they lik
ed to be where famous people were. But 
that™s human nature. And among Œ among those that Œ that 
[indecipherable]
 and 
that they were part of, you know, 
contro lling the sums of money that 
Switzerland
 
was willing to give, and 
Germany
, and they don™t want yo
u to ask any questions. 
And that™s human nature, because look at
 some of these people, look at these 
Orthodox Jews from 
New Jersey
, that go to  Œ that go to 
Isr a e l
 and approach poor 
people to sell them a k idney 
for 10,000 dollars and then 
peddle it off back home for 

160,000 dollars. They™re not ashamed 
[indecipherable]
. And Œ and this Mr. ma y Œ
 
Madoff
, 
Woody Allen
 wrote a one page story in ﬁ
The New Yorkerﬂ
 called ﬁ
Tails 
of Ma nhattan,ﬂ
 t-a-i-l-s, where these two gu
ys, these two guys are Œ have 
coronaries and they  come back as lobste
rs. And they are lobsters in this fancy 
restaurant in 
New York.
 And in co mes
 Madoff
, and he wants two lobst Œ th ese two

lobsters for himself an d his wife, he want
s to give her a nice dinner. And wh at 
happens, a Œ it™s Œ he has such an
 imagination, it is so funny. 
Q: I gotta look it up. 
I™ve gotta look it up. 
A: Yes, it Œ it™s a Œ  

Q: So it sounds like, you know, you experi
enced Œ experienced the real thing, and 

got out just in time, but also have seen
 how, years later, decades later, sometimes 
it™s used in not quite the right wa
ys, whatever the experience was. 
A: Abso lutely. Un Œ now, when
 Œ when they said
 they™d come to 
the apartments, so 
my  parents got a taxi, and th e four of us 
went to the Polish embassy. And it™s octo Œ 
it™s Novemb er, and it™s north. And Œ and boot
s had just come out. They  were boots 
with a Œ with a combination of leather a
nd Œ and su ede. And in
 th e afternoon we 
arrived there, and they  tell my  parent
s, you™re Polish Jews, you™re not Polish 
citizens. A nd they permitted us, behind th
e wall, to walk. And it was quite cold. 
Then they permitted women 
and children to go inside. 
And one woman didn™t have 
any ch ildren, so my  mo ther gave her 
my  brother. And she went and Œ with 
Peter
 
and I Œ I went with my  mo ther and my  
dad and the men remain
ed outside. At six 
o™clock they permitted the men to come 
in also. And at eight o™clock somebody 
came out to say that 
Goebbels
 ministry called, that it was 
safe to go back home. So 
there you are. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0568 
38
 
 
A: Yeah, it was 
[indecipherable]
 that™s just how it was. 
And Œ and yet, you know, 
Peter
 and I, to a degree we Œ we witnessed 
certain things, but we didn™t question it, 
and Œ and Œ and that™s how it 
was until Œ until we left. A
nd we really, it was like the 
last train out of
 Berlin. 
Q: It sounds like Œ 
A: One of the last ones out. 
Q: It sounds like it. W ell, thank you. 
A: It was fa Œ 

Q: Thank you very much. 
A: Oh, so Œ 
Q: Let™s look at some pictures. 

A: So that™s 
Peter. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Now, this is my  parents, smoking. 
Q: Wow, she Œ 

A:

Q: Yes. 

A: This my  father, with his older brother

Regina

Q: Oh, how lovely. Very lovely.
