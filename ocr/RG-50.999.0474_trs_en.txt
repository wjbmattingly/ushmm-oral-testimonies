>> Agi Geva:  T hank you.  Hello. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Agi, thank you so muchfor joining us and your will ingness to spend thistime 
with us.  Ina short hour you have som uchtotell us so we're going to try to do justice to itand 
ge t  s t
arted right away.
 
 
W orldW ar II began wit h German's invasion of Poland on September1, 1939.  But 
bef ore we turn to the war and the Holocaust, let's start with you telling us about yourf am ily, 
your com munity and your early lif e in the years bef ore war broke out in Europe?
 
>> Agi Geva: W e hada com pletely norm al, nice childhood, m y sister andme.  Our parents 

were very caref ul thatwe shouldn't know wh at's happening in the world.  T here was no 
television. W e were not supposedto listen to the radio, news,
 
anyhow.  So we really didn't 
know what was going on inthe world exactly.  
 
Som ethings were felt.  Inthe school room  they 
hadonly two Jewish gi rls in the classroom .  It felt different. W e were never invited to birthday 
parties or to any holidays
 b
y our
 cla ssm a t e s. 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedtom e that you were full of patriotism for Hungary in those 

days.  Can you say a little bitaboutthis
 
as a child?
 
>> Agi Geva: W rotepoem s.  If elt very im portantas a Hungarian student. All my plans were 

re a
lly around Hungary,  to go to Hungarian universities, ever ything about Hungary.  So it was a 
quite shocking surprise to f ind out that I am actually m ore Jewish than Hungarian.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Agi, tell us what caused yourfam ily tom ove to Miskolc. Why di
d the fam ily 
have to m ove? 
 

>> Agi Geva:  Even in 1936 already, and thatwas reall y early still, Je ws were not supposedto 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
6
 
be in key positions.  So m yf ather wasf ired. He couldn'tf ind any job anym ore after this. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So that's whatf orced the move to Miskolc? 
 
>> Agi Geva:  Itf orced the wholefam ily to m ove to Miskolc.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he war, of  course, began inSeptember
 
1939 when Germany and Russia 
attacked Poland,but your com munity, Hungary and your comm unity, didnot feelthef ull im
pa
ct  
of  the war really until 1944
 
whenthe Nazis occupied Hungary and your town. W hat in that 
ver y long period
 
--
 
tellus a little bitabout your fam ily's lif eand whatwas going on during that 
ver y long period of time before the Nazis cam e into your town
.  
>> Agi Geva: W e were not quiteaware what really was happeningbesides Hungary. W hen 
they occupied Hungary, it was thebiggest surprise of all of us.  It was im possible to imagine 
thatone day ever ything looks
 
f ineand everyt hing is ok;
 
we are going to
 
school, to the movies, 
having parties.  One day f rom  the other suddenly ever ything changes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before everything suddenly changing, do you know if  yourfam ily was awar e of  
what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe? 
 
>> Agi Geva:  I suppose so. I suppose. But there is a sentence that we still use that 

Auschwitz never happened so Hungarians was sure that tothem  itwould never happen.  It 
was quite a shock, quite a surprise.  And it was so quick
 w
hat they started to do.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before that happened, at some point yourf ather really ga ve thef am ily two 

options if  you were to avoid what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe.  What were the 
two optionsthat he gave thef am ily and whatdid thefam ily do? 
 
>> Agi Geva:  He saidsom ething m ightbe very wrong.  He thought that we should leave 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

Hungary.  And that was im possible to do becausem y m other wouldn't have left her sisters.  
Shehad nine sisters and brothers.  Andm y fatherhad eight. Sothey wouldn't have lef t the 
f a m ily.   T
hey didn't speak any languagesexcept Hungarian.  Andhere com es the im portance 
of m y f ather's goal,actually.  He toldm y sister andm e that you have to have something that 

can't be taken away f rom  youand that is languages. W e spoke Germ anf luently bef o
r e  goi ng 
to school. And thenEnglish, spokef luent English bef oreeverything else was going to happen.  
It was ver y im portantfor him . T hat ina way
,  
he really saved m y life with this idea.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And one option was, of  course,f orthef am ily to leave and go to Palestineif  

possible, but as you said, your m otherdid notwant to leave her extendedf amily.
 
Another option, Ithink, he off ered you was toconvert to Christianity? 
 

>> Agi Geva:  Yeah, he had som e ideas. T hey were not realistic enough
.   He wa s t o o  sick 
already to changeeverything or anything.  Just m adeout with what's going to happen.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of course, March 19,1944,extraordinary im portant day in your lif e. Tell 

us about that day. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  Hungary was occupied
 
onthe sam e day m y dad died. And som ehow 
ever ything, ever ything changedf rom thatm inuteon.W e have to wear yello w star.  I hadto 

bring m y bicycle to them unicipality. W e couldn't have any bicycles.  T here were changes
 
--
 
talking about changes that we can't keepourhome anym ore.W e have to 
--
 
m aybe in the 
country, we will be deported. My sister and Iwere looking at each other. W ehad to get yellow 
star, deportation, concentration cam ps, thatwe never, ever thought we had to use and never 
heard be
fore.

>> Bill Benson:  Didn'tyour m other try to save you or protect you bysending you to another 
vil lage at one point?
 
>> Agi Geva:  She did.  She sent
 
ustoa French wif e who wasn't Jewish but she was so 
scared. She didn't let us out of the house
;  
didn
't let usoutof her sight. W e had to callm y 
m other,notto come back andface whatever it is because we can'tstay in that village.  
 

 
It was dramatic how we can com ebackbecause we had the yellow star.  If we didn't 
wear it, they can look and askf or our docum ents and show that we are Jewish and we don't 

have the yellow star.  So we couldn't win either wa y.  So we decided to goand take the train to 
go back to Miskolc wit hout wearing the yellow star.  And the Hungarian police were on the 
trains and tookoff people, m any people, justby looking at them, just
 
by not liking 
their face, 
their voice.  And,of  course, thesepeople were sent to concentration camps, to Siberia. W e 

never found out.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And they just happenedtonot check youor ask
 
you? 
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hey ignored us. W e got som ehow on.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And then after thathad to start wearing the yello w star afterthat?
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hen we had to goto the ghetto. T hat was very trau m atic.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout the ghetto, you were also,Ithink,at som e point sent 

to work on afarm.
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hey thought 
--
 
the Hungarian m unicipality advertised that who is ready towork 
on af arm .  How shall I tell you? W e can save ourselvesf rom concentration cam p which we 
didn't know yet what it exactly m eant. So som e30peoplef rom m y m other'sf riends went to 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
9
 
them unicipality and swore loyalt y to Hungary, which wasn't hard to doactually because we 
were still ver y patriotic in a way at that time. W e were working very hard inthef arm , work 
which we were not used to in picking vegetables and planting.  It was a hard tim e. Af ter 
m onths we were sentback to the ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And when you were sent back to Miskolc, something dreadf ulhappened to 

s o m e of t h e m
en when you went back. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hey were questioned. W e were stopped in
 
another village bef ore we got to 
Miskolc.  They were beaten up very badly and questioned where didthey bury their jewels, 
their money
,  
to whom did they gi ve it.  It was ver y traum atic. First tim e really we saw and 
heard violence am ong the closef riends and relatives.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, now that you're back in Miskolc and put into the ghetto atthis 
point, this is them iddle of  June.  So the Nazis are in March.  By them iddle of  June you're in a 
ghetto.T hen you were taken to abrick factory f or deportation. T ellus about that andthentell 
us what they did with you. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  T he brick factory was actually som ething I kind of rem em ber.  I know therewas 

a roof . T here were nosides, no wall
s
.  Itm eant that we could haveescaped. Many of m y 
m other'sf riends just walkedout. T he guardswere not too alertatthis point. T hey advised m y 

m other take the girls and just walk out, go, run away.  She was af raid that she will lose one of 
us or we won't be ableto stay together ornotm ake it anym ore. She declined. Butthen she 
was so sorry, of  course, later.  
 
 
And we were told thatthey are waiting f or trains to come andthe trains will take us out 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
of  t he  c ou n t r
y.
  
W e thought the trains would be the way we were used to it
,  
the way we wen t to 
Budapest always
: 
 
sandwiches, looking out the window, and talkingand sit
t in g
 
on the table.  
But when thetrains cam e, they were cattle cars, boxcars. T hey sim ply told us to
 
go in.  It was 
im possible to get on them even.  So the Hungarian soldiers with theguns all the time, we were 
ever ywhere on gun point, heldus up and pushedasm any people, standing places,as they 
could.  I can't even tell you, 30, 40 people.  T hey close
d the door. And it was a situationthat I 
never knew how we got into.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou toldm eat onepoint that youassum ed itwould be a several
-
hour 
train trip that you werebeingf orced to go on,even under thesehorrif ic conditions a shor
t 
duration. Butthat wasn't the case.  You were in that trainf ora while. 
 

>> Agi Geva:  It was dark, noair, no windows .  It was a 
pail
 
in the corner. T he situation was 
som ething that I can'teven describe.
 
 
T he worst thing, they were very sm all kids, pregnant wom en, olderpeople, sick 
people. People started to scream , couldn't stop. Men started to cry and couldn't stop. T here 

were kids who cried constantly.  T he situation was som ething which is 
u
ndescribable
. 
And then when the train started tom ove,
 
we som ehow had to sit down.  W efell down, even.  It 
was ver y bad what we saw. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Can you tell us a little bitabout that? 
 
>> Agi Geva: W e saw two groups of  people,m en and wom en, separated im mediately whe n 

we jum ped off. T herewas so m uch begging, m en and wom en clinging to their husbands, 
brothers, sons.  Didn't want to separate.  Of course, we were all at gun point. W e hadto go a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
different way
, d
iff erentdirection. Until the people count
 
down, it tooka long, long tim e. W e 
never were the sam eanym ore.  Many of us,of  course, never saw the menanym ore, talking 
about the group of  wom en I was in.  
 
 
And thenm y m other really got scared.  So she told us just to walk sl owl y with the 
crowd as we are supposed to,at gun point, of  course
, a
n
d she will s om ehow go betweenthe 
lines tothe beginningand f indout what's happening. W hat she saw was that nof am ily should 

be kept together. T hat was the idea after selecting off icers
 
--
 
we called it the selection. T here 
were t wo sides, the right side and the left side. W e never knew wh at happened on the left 

side.  My sister and me actually f ound out only af ter the liberation because my mother was so 
caref ul. She was af raid that we won't beable to stand it. 
 
And then she saw that girls under 16 
w
ere sent
 
toa left side.  So she cam eback, slowl y, slo wl y.  Shef ound us and told usthatwe 
have tobe very caref ul notto call herm other,not to tell m y sister is my sister, not totell our 
age.  She tookoff ourscarves and wound our heads that we should look a little bit older. And 
then we got to the selecting off icers.  Of course, we were so shocked and so scared,but 
som ehow we all got tothe same side.  So we were chosen. But shethought we would be a 
workin g group.  Sothis tim e we stayedtogether.  And that was abig achievem ent.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other sounds sobrave and resourcef ul.  Asyou said amom entago, 

because of girls under 16 were sent toone side, sheputthe scarves on you to make you look 
older but she putone on herself adiff erent way to m ake her look younger andthat helped 
keep you together.
 
>> Agi Geva:  Som ething helped. Luck. God.

>> Bill Benson: T ell us about yourf riend, Ed
i
th, if  you don'tm ind. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  Edith was the other Jewish girl i n our classroom . As
 
I told you
,  
there were only 
two gi rls.  She was wit h our group.  From  Miskolc everybody knew e ach other.  She was a 
ver y, very goodf riendof m ine.W e stayedtogether.  But when we got to the right side, she 
found thatherm otherwasn't with us.  Hermother was imm ediately sent to the left side.  She 
stayed alone. She didn't know what it meant.  And m y mother told 
he r
 
she's going to lookaf ter 
her and caref orher. But when it cam e
 
--
 
when thenext day
 
--
 
actually f irst day in Auschwitz, 
they came with a loudspeaker, with big trucks, and told every girl under 16 should get on the 
trucks, going to getbetter f ood,better treatment. They were running to the trucks.  My m other 
begged her to stay with us. She said
:  D
on'tsay your age, stay with us
;  
I  will
 
look af ter you.  
But she was so worried f or her mother.  Shewanted to meether
 
som uch, she got on the 
t ru cks;  t h
ought they would takeher to aplace where she could meet her mother.  Of course, 
we never saw her anym ore. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  FromAuschwitz you were selectedfor slave labor and you were sent tothen 
this place called Plaszow.
 
>> Agi Geva:  Plaszo w.  I will talk a little bit about thef irstday in Auschwitz.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Please do.
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hat was thebiggest hum iliation that a person can ever have. W e were ledto a 

big hall where we had to undress. It was very hard to im agine that we had to take off allof our 
clothesand leave it ina corner.  It was moredramatic and tragic becausemany
 
--
 
m y m other 
also and herf riends
 
--
 
sewed
 
in the clothes and inthe pocketm oney, documents, jewels.

T hey knew that without this property, there isnothing they cando.They can't buy food. T hey 
can't write.  They can'tsurvi ve even m aybe. So there was the hysterics, crying, begging th at 
wa s  
going on.  It was im possible to imagine.
 
 
So after this we hadtofaceanotherhum iliation. W e were shavedf rom all hair on our 
bodies. W edidn't recognize each other.  It was sohum iliating to stand therenaked. And it 
wasn't enoughthat they sprayed us with disinfectant. It was very ba d.
 
 
T hen we were sent to the showers. W edidn't know, had no idea
 
how luck y we were.  
W ereally didn't think that we were lucky.  But when we found out that in the other shower 
room sthere was gas com ing f rom  the shower
s a
nd thosepeople never sur vived. W e didn't 
know that we were lucky that we had water. So that was a very, ver y hard tim e thef irst day. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And once you were able to survi ve thosef irstdays you were sent toPlaszow 
for hard labor.  You would go back to Auschwi tz, but describe Plaszow to us.
 
>> Agi Geva:  Plaszo w was actually the place
 
--
 
I didn't experience, and m y m other was so 
caref ul we shouldn't see, shouldn't know but there was a lot going on there. W ehad very 
hum iliating work. W e
 
hadto carry heavy rocks up a hill one day.  And thenext day we had to 
carry them  back.  It was ver y hard.  It was in them iddle of  summer. T he sun was ver y strong.  

Our skin was burned and peeling. W e looked bad. W efelt really ver y m iserable.
 
>> B i l
l Benson:  And you would be eventually sentbackto Auschwitz andf ace evenmore 
selections when you went back. Tell usabout that. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  Som e of the Germansdecidedto liquidatethe cam pbecause of being af raid 

thatthe Russiansm ight do it before. So we were sent back to the railwa y station, back to the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

boxes. W e knew by now what it meant. The only better thing it was that it was all working 
people, all grown
-
ups;no kidsno sickpeople, no very old people. So at leastthis was 
som ewhat bett
er. And thetrip was one day. But we were crying all the tim e.  My sister and 
m e, we couldn't seeany hope even.  My m other keptontelling us that you have been through 
the worst cam ps,have been to Auschwitz to Plaszow
; y
ou wi ll see that we will get to
 
a much 
better place.  You will have it better. 
 
 
But when thedoors opened, of course, we saw it was Auschwit z. W e were m ore than 
destroyed. Som y m other took a chance. She saw oneGermanoff icer m aking the selection
s.   

And this one Germanoff icer, Men
gele

W e

m other told us onthe train still that we should
 
follow her in any case, wherever they send her, 
we should try tof ollow her.  And we should try to get to the working cam p because the 

Germ ans will al ways n eed workers.  So try, she told us, all the tim eto be in working cam por to 
follow her.  She thought that we would not survive without her.  T hat's why she took the chance 
to go after her.  So Itold the Germ an off icer, no, no, no,please, please, letm e go.

And then herealized that the

I told him  
we had Germ an nannies but that I don't rem em beranything else. He told me, ok, go to the

>> Bill Benson:  And when youthinkback to your com ments earlier,Agi, about your 
f ather 
insisting that you learnlanguages
;  
that that's the onething you can count on.
 
>> Agi Geva:  So m y parents really

m y m other told me what to do.  My f ather to see to it that 
we know the language.  Peopleaskm e

Nobody dared to talkto him.  But,no, I wasn't af raidof him .  I was afraid of m y m other.

My sister and I were in another barracknearby. 
 
 
My m other got

there were selections in Auschwit z ever y day f or different

W e were standing outside in lines of f ive
 
fo

tobe counted. The numbers are 
right in ever y barrack.  And this tim e theyf ound out that there was one more.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So when they counted, there's one more personthan they're supposed to 

have.
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hey 
f
oundout that inthe sick barrack, there was one less. They started to 
scare all of us. God knows what the sicknessof  
t
hisperson, would be able to contract us wi th.  
So they kept telling us we are going to be shot if you don't say who is theone who cam e to the 

b a rra cks.  
 M
y m other was highly respectedfor a strange reason. Soall the 300 people in the 
barrack, nobody was r eady to tell that she was theone. T here wasver y little f ood, very, ve ry

som ea day. W ehad a slice of bread a day.  Maybe sometim es more. And there 
were f am ily m embersstealingf rom each other. T here were cryin gs , beatings, yellings. W ith 

m y m other they saw the opposite.  She was so sorry f or us.  Sheused to tell my sister, 
ﬁ
I had 
m y breadalready, here, this is yours.
ﬂ
  
Or to  m e .  A nd
 
people saw this and couldn't im agine 
how she does it.  Shestayed sohungry andgave her food of the day awa y.  So they woul dn't 
have said that it was she who joined the group.

>> Bill Benson:  So
 
all night you're out there?
 
>> Agi Geva:  All night we were standing outside thinking now they will shootus, take us, 
execute us.  Somehow, I never found out,but that
 
adm inistration decided and why t
hat we 
were spared.

would she do that? 
 
>> Agi Geva: W hen there were selections, they used to look som etim es at strongf eet, at 
han

s 
and close itand hide it sideways in her shoe
; t
hat I shouldn't lookdifferent. I should be able to 

be inthe sam e group. She was most scaredall of  the tim e in Auschwit z about being 
separated. T hat was her biggest fear that weare going to be separated.

thisall beganwith the Germ an occupation of Hungary in March

so by late1944 you were sentf rom Auschwit z for your last tim ef rom  Auschwitz.  T ell us where 
they took youf rom Auschwitz and what the conditions were like thatyou faced once you left 
there. 
 
>> Agi Geva: W e were sent
 
--
 
f irst of all, we were selectedand selectedevery day, e ver y day, 
until we found a group.  The group
 
was 200people, 150 Hungarians, 20Polishpeople. The

Polish people were the

they were usually Polish because they spoke the language. T hey 
spokeGerman.  Andm ost Hungariansdid not. W hen we were selected in this group, the 
group was sent to thestation again.  But this tim e it was winter.  And I think that was m y worst 
trip ever.  It was so cold.  Andevenf or the cattle they usedtoput straw or som ething in the 
cars, but we hadnothing.  Nothing.  No water, nodrink, no blank
et s
. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
  
I thinkthat was an especially harsh winter. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Aparticularly brutal winter, wi nter of 
‚
44, 
‚
45.  So you're in these cattle cars.  
And where do they take you? 
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hree days again.  My m otherall thetim e kept rubbing m y f eet so they shouldn't 

f reeze.  And then they tookus to Germ any. They tookus ina smallplace called Rochlitz.  It 
was a learning camp.  We were supposed tom ake airplane spare parts, small screws.  So that 
was the learning cam p.  Andf rom
 
theretheywere supposed to take us to abig cam p, big 
factory, af ter we knew how to do it.  But it was diff erent. It wasn't Auschwitz.  Andf or us,of  

course, it was different.  It was already better.  The sleeping quarters were better. Thefood 
was better. W e were sitting in chairs inf rontof  atable.  I got the pencil in m y hand
a
nd a piece 
of  bread. Itm eant that I'm a personagain. 
 
 
I should have m entioned that when I cam e back the second time to Auschwitz, they 
tattooed our lef tarm and told us we are only numbers. Sothat's why I was m uch happierwith 

the pencil
;  
that we arenot just numbers andwe are responsible, people.

>> Agi Geva:  Auschwi tz was a death camp. It was.  It was a deathcam p but Ididn't know.  
T here was electricity in thefences. It was not for settlement.  But then they needed workers.  
T hey neededfactory workers. T hey had to keep us som ehow f ed better and they had to keep 
us
 
working to do the jobs that they were supposedtodo.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And they were, of  course,desperatef or those suppliesfor the war eff ort.
 
>> Agi Geva:  Desperate f orthe supplies.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you're taught to make screws f or airplaneparts
.  Your m other engaged in 
acts of sabotage.
 
>> Agi Geva:  Yeah. This was in thefactory. My sister got these screws that I was supposed 

to prepareonam achine. She had the control panel. She had to see whether the small 
screws were too big or too small.W hen they were too small, they were thrown away. W hen 
they were too big, they went to thedepartment where m y m other was working on a big f iling 
stone.  Shehad to keep the spare parts smaller, so she hadtouse this big f iling wheel.  And 
we suddenly
 
heard that m y m otherfaintedand the wheel exploded. She was told that this 
wheel 
--
 
she should be ver y careful how shepushes the screws.  It takes tim e to order it. It 
com es back af ter they ordered it.  Andthen standing in 
--
 
the crateswere in the doorway and 
they couldn't be sent out
.  S
o she gotan idea that maybe,m aybe, she could help the wara 
little bit by doing this more times. And then the crates would stand longer tim e in thef actory
 
a
nd will not be sent out to theairplanes.  So she kepto
n doing this.  T he stone exploded.  She 
fainted. W e were not supposedto know, m y sister and me. W eneverf ound out.  Only later.

Bill Benson: T hat it was not deliberate onher part. T hey didn't know that. W ow.
 
>> Agi Geva:  Def initely.  But shef elt so good about it.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Andf inally in February
 
1945, you were sent out of thefactory of  Calw on a 
forced m
arch. T ellusabout that m arch andwhat you thought wasgoing to happen to you at 
thatpoint. T his is so late in the war. W hat did you think? 
 
>> Agi Geva:  T he Germ an guards

we hadfour Germ an guards
:  
one woman,three off icers.  
T he wom an was also an officer.  And soldiers.  They got anorder toget us out of the town and 
nobody should ever see us.  They should do it in such a way that we are not seen. W e 
thought we were going to the railway station as usual, traveling.  Butwe had to walk.  Andth
is  
is som ething we would never, ever im agine that it is a possibility to walk 400
 
kilometers at 
night, without clothes.All we had was a dress, 
shoes
;  
no  so cks
,  
no underwear, no scarves, no 
gloves, no hats, no nothing. W e triedtobring our blankets that
 
we had. W e just walked out of  
this place
 w
ith nothing on.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In February.  Sof reezing cold. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  And at night it was even m orefreezing.  And we had to walk at night because 

they didn't wantthe villagers or anybody to see us.W e walked.
  
And during the daytim e we 
were put up in barns to try to sleep,try to rest.  Guards triedtof indus somef ood.

:  S o 1 99 .  
 
>> Agi Geva:  199. And 179 Hungarians andthe rest were Polish.
  
Sometimes wef ound som e 
potatoes, som e cabbage.  Not so bad.
 
 
And then there were two gi rls who knew Germ an.  So the Germans keptontelling us 
to walk quickl y, we have to get to
 
a railway st ation where there's com ing another train to take 
us on.  But the girls understood that'snot true; that the train that is com ing is going tobring 
guns and ordered to execute us
, a
ll 199 of us. T hat's what they heard the guards talking. 
 
I  wa
s in sucha condition thatI couldn't care. I couldn't care anym ore.  I couldn't even care that 
we were so lucky, they kept ontelling us, becauseusually on theseDeath March
e
s when 
som ebody couldn't walk, just sitdown at the side of the road and was shot.  And our guards 

when we couldn't walk, they really helped us to walk. W edidn't know that they were helping 
us to walk toour execution. Anyhow, I was in such a conditionthat Icouldn't careanym ore.  
Execution, walking, yes train, no train, I just couldn't walk anym ore. 
 
 
W hen we got tothe station, thetrain was gone.  No guns.  No orders to execute us.  
Envelopes were given to the officers. Later wef ound out they were papers for them  to go to 
Swit zerland, which we didn't know at the tim e. 
  
 
Bu t
 
m y worst day ever was when they sent us back to theforestbecauseusually we 
walked through theforest, creeks.  My feet were bleeding already.  T hey sent us back tom ore 

walkin g.  So Ithought
:  
I can't do it anym ore.

Ye s .
 
>> Agi Geva:  Suddenly one of us saw thereare no guards aroundus.  Lookaround. No 
guards.  So there were no guards.  Andthenoneof  the couples of the Polish women called us 
around her and told us as slowly as possible thatf rom today, 1945,28 of April, youaref ree!  
Until we heard this wor d and until we realized what it m eant.  So worst of  the worst days inm y 
lif e became the best of the best.

[Laughter]
 
Ever ybody thought weare somewhere else. Ever ybody thought weshould go north.  Others 

thought 
we should gosouth. T hen they thought we are going tof all into Russian hands, in 
French hands, in German hands again.T here were so many arguments that my mother had 

just enough of it. She found 35
 
f riends
 
--
 
we didn't have any relatives there with us.
  
She 
agreed with them  thatwe are going to start in a certain direction.
 
 
My sister didn't care what was going on. She sat down and started to eat herfood.  
T hen we were told that we shouldn't eat at allaf ter so many starving days; it m ight be very

we heard actually a group of  people. Looke

T
hey were 
soldiers.  Of course we got scared.  And thenthey sentm e to speakEnglish to them . And I 
told them  who we were .  And they came nearer and lookedat us. They thought that they had 
never, ever in their whole lives saw so m anyugly, dirt y, bald wom en in their lives.  But they 
tookus under their wings, the way we say.  They tookus to their headquarters. They looked 
af ter us. T hey brought doctors. T hey told uswe can take off the curtains to s

clothes 
because we had nothing. 
 

 
An d
 
then oneday they told us they are going shopping.  Everybody can askf or 
anything.  So some people askedfor chocolate cake. Som ebody askedfor a sweater. 

Somebody askedfor schnitzel, m eat, sandwi ch.  Something that we dreamt of  the whole year.  
T h e y

So they broughtm e.

My m other gave to som epeoplefor safe keeping jewels, f ur coats,stuff  shehad.  She

I ' m  su r e  
it's evident to everybody that Agi was only able to just touch on the surface of m any, m any 
things that she could tell us about and we could spendhours with her. W e're going to wrap the 
program  up ina mom ent.
  
I'd like to,f irstof  all, thank youfor being with us, invite you come

that you can come back.

oturn to Agi to close our program  in am om ent.W hen she's done,af ter 
she's said her closing words, I'm  going to ask you to stand, if  you don't mind,becauseour

background.  It's justan incredible portrait ofAgi.  T hey're ver y powerful.  So if  youdon't mind 
doing that, we'll do that.
 
 
W ehaven't hada chance, because Agi had so much to share with us,f or questions 
andanswers.  But when she leaves the stage, she will m akeher way up outside where you 
cam e in. She's going to be available to sign copiesof  her book

or the " Echoes of  M
e m o ry . "   
But if  you want to sayhi, ask Agi a question,talk with her, absolutely feelf ree to do that.You'll 

s t a y a  lit t le  
while for that.
 
 
It is ourtradition thatour 
F i rs t  P e rs o n
 
hasthe Last word.  I'm  going to turn it over to 
Agi to close itout now.
 
>> Agi Geva:  Ok.  My last word has to be very strange.  My sister who never wanted to talk 

about what happenedand m y m other who never wanted to rem em ber it, but whenmy sister 
heardme thef irst tim e, theonly tim e, she was really in shock. She says, 
ﬁT
hat's how it 
happened?
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
That's what youare telling?
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
T here are people inmentalhospitals because they 
can't get over 
it and you're really
 
--
 
you've really told it in a way that it doesn'tm ake sense.
ﬂ
  
So  
she rem em bered
 
--
 
rem indedm eof all the atrocities, all the cruelties, all the horrible things that 
were happening tothat ifI would be talking about itand if  I wouldm ention it, I couldn't be able 
to do it on a weekly basis andtell m y whole story.  I couldn't. SoI just have to skipm any, 
m any things that she knew thathappenedand didn't hearm em ention them . I explained it to 
her and told her if  you could tell it the way I tell it, it would bealso very nice.  But she just can't 
talk about it.  So it wasn't exactly the way
 
--
 
what I told was true, butI had to leave out a lot, a 
lot of  things that happened to all of  us.
