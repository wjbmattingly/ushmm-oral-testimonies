Question: This is an interview for the 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Cha rles Stein
 conducted by 
Esther Finder
 on 
June 8
th
, 1999 in  
Rockville, Maryland. 
This interview is part of the museum™s 
project to interview Holocaust survivors 
and witnesses who are also volunteers 
with the museum. This is
 a follow-up interview 
that will focus on Mr.
 Stein™s
 post-
Holocaust experiences. In preparation for th
is interview I listened to the interview 
you conducted with the Surv ivors of the
 Shoah
 Visual History Fo undation on 
February 27
th
, 1997. I will not ask you to repe
at everything you said in that 
interview, instead I will use 
this interview as an opport
unity to follow 
up on that 
interview and fo cus on your post-Holocaust 
experiences. This is tape number one, 
side
 A.
 What was your name at birth? 
Answer: My  name was 
Karl Robert Stein
. The only thing that is different from Œ 
from present time is the first name.
 Karl 
was changed to 
Charles
, but it Œ actually, 
I didn 't change it. It was changed by the authorities in 
Luxembourg  
wh en  th ey  
issued me a  passport. They 
simply wrote in there, a
nd my  name in Œ in that 
Luxembourg
 stateless passport on which I traveled after I left 
Austria
 was Œ they

translate it in
to the French, 
Cha r les, 
which is the same as Œ same spelling as
 
Charles 
and that™s remained that way. 
Q: Did you ever consid er going 
back to the original spelling? 
A: No, no. Actually, when
 I was Œ even as Œ in 
Vienna
, my friends, since I Œ I was 
Œ well, I was the only one in the group wh
o Œ who spoke eng Œ en
 Œ of my  friends 
that spoke English, knew English. I™d st
udied English. And so  Œ I™d seen, you 
know, American movies and all that
. So my  Œ they called me, and Œ 
Charlie
. 
Actually, th-the way it sounded then, as 
they pronounced it, 
it sounded more like
 
Sharlie
. So, it was nothing really new to 
me, and I remained with that.  
Q: Can you just tell me also your pl
ace of birth and your date of birth? 
A: Yes, I-I was born in 
Vienna, Austria
 on November 28
th
, 1919. 
Q: What languages did you speak in 1945? 

A: In 1945 I spoke Englis
h and German. German because I was at the time a 

prisoner of war interrogator in the army. 
Q: Where were you on 
V-E 
day? 
A: On 
V-E
 day I was somewhere on th e 
Elbe
 river, facing the Russians on the 
other side, that™s where we had to  stop. I was with the ninth infantry division, 60
th
 
infantry regiment and I was 
at the time a captain in the 
U.S. 
Army  and co mmander 
of a military intelligence unit, a pr
isoner of war interrogation team.

Q: By 
V-E
 day, how long ha
ve you been  in the service? 
A: By 
V-E 
day, I™ve been in the serv
ice for just about four ye
ars. I was Œ originally 
I was drafted on October 7
th
, 1941, two months before 
Pearl Harbor
. 
Q: Had you seen combat in 
Europe
? 
A: Yes, I saw combat. I 
got into Œ I was in the 
Normandy 
landings on th e day after 
D-Day
 Œ I Œ after 
D-Day
 on Œ on June seventh. I 
was up on th e beach, and my  
duties then were, again, I Œ I had a 
Œ an interrogation team and we were 
interrogating prisoners of war. But under th
e Œ at that point, of course, it was 
combat. It was combat and interrogating 
and shooting so me more and so  forth. 
Everybody was in 
combat then.  
Q: On your way thro ugh
 Euro pe
, did you Œ did you enco
unter any concen tration 
camps that had just been liberated? 
A: Through 
Europe
? Yes, the only one that I enco
untered on the way through the Œ 
in the campaign was 
Nordhausen
, concentration camp
 No rdhausen
, which we 
came upon not knowing where we Œ that there was a concentration until we Œ til we 

ran into it. It was a Œ it was a horrible e
xperien ce. Knowing th at my  parents mu st 

be in one of those, I Œ I sort of instinctiv
ely started looking around to see if I could 
see my  parents. It wa Œ it was a Œ an im
pression that stayed with me for a long 
time. It was the Œ bodies lying around, peop
le wandering around in  a daze. We tried

to, the little time that we had, we were m
oving pretty fast at the time, chasing the 
rest of the Germans in the direction of th e Œ of the Russians. And we were there for 
about a day or two, I did interrogate some 
of the guards. They Œ so me of them, as I 
recall, were Ukrainian guards 
that the surviv ors of Œ of the camp  Œ many of them 
by th e way in 
No rdhausen
 w-was one of the camp s that had a lot of slave labors 
from eastern 
Europe
, a lot of Yugoslavs that I en
countered there. They wanted 
those guards. And if I lost any of them 
on the way, I Œ I-I can™t remember. But they 
Œ the guards were scared. I recall one gua
rd, who abso lutely refused to talk. And 
we had ways of, you know, in
terrogate Œ ways of interroga
te Œ this Œ this was not a 
friendly interrogation, so we made them ta
lk. Not by physical fo
rce in any way, but 
by Œ oh, various things. Like we have hi
m take off his clothes. And when  a man 
stands there in front of you without his cl
othes on, he™ll start talking pretty soon, 
we found out. That™s an interesting thing 
we learned over Œ over the Œ we sort of 
picked up as we went through the war 
and Œ interrogation techniques that they 
didn™t teach us in school. But he f Œ he talk
ed and I got Œ I got his story, of course, I 
can™t remember the details now. But I did ge
t a Œ the story of some of the atrocities 
that the Œ they were Œ they
 committed. I turned the people over Œ the Œ the guards 
over to the military police that
 picked them up and took th
em back to prison camps.

Q: The guards that you said you Œ if yo
u misplaced them alon
g the way, you Œ you 
don™t rememb er, do you know wh at
 happened to those guard s? 
A: No, I don™t. I have no idea.  
Q: You also said that you employed techni
ques that you didn™t learn in school. Can 
you tell me a little bit about 
your training in Œ in some of the techniques that you 
were trained to use and some of th
e ones you learned along the way? 
A: Yes, well, in the military I was Œ I was 
Œ I went to Œ I was originally in field 
artillery. I went to officer candidate school
 and became Œ I was an artillery officer. 
And then  I was, shortly after graduation at Fo rt
 Sill, Oklahoma
 where the artillery 
school was, I was tapped for intelligence b
ecause of my backgr
ound in languages 
and so fo rth. I was called one night Œ one 
evening I was called in and was told that 
Washin gton
, in quotes, at that time wanted me
 to go to  Œ wanted me to go to  the 
intelligence school, which was at Fort
 Ritchie
, right in Œ in 
Mary land
 here, then 
called Camp
 Ritchie
. That was the military inte
lligence school and we went 
through interrogation training and all kindsof intelligence training. Oh, we learned 

all kinds of things like
 Morse
 code, which I have never used in my life. Don™t 
know anybody who ever did, and 
folder
 interpretation, map reading of foreign 
maps, which was important because some 
of the captured maps we had to Œ to 
know wh at we saw, and we had all kinds of
 field training with those. These were

Mary land Œ Ma ryla nd
 maps, ma ps of the Œ of the 
Ritchie
 area, but printed in 
various languages including Japanese. I reme
mb er one night that
 they dropped me 
off someplace at a place and gave me this 
Œ this map. And from landmarks and all 
that, you identified where you 
were and wh ich way you we
re going. Well, that was 
important but in Œ basically for me that 
was not a problem because I was fluent in 
German, of course, my  native language, I also knew French. And that™s the 
direction we went in, so once we got there,
 I could easily read those maps if Œ if 
necessary. We were trained in order of 
battle, identifying Œ we 
learned everything 
about the German Œ we knew more about th
e German army, their uniforms, their Œ 
their insignia. That was all part of Œ of 
the training and the units, the organization 
of the German army, what un
its looked like, wh
at they  were, how ba Œ how strong 
they were, etcetera. That was all p art of 
it because that was all part of Œ of the 
interrogation process. And so when we Œ 
when I got into Œ to the combat are Œ 
zone, interrogating the people was simple. 
One thing, for example, was that every 
German had what was called a 
so ldbuch,
 a paybook. Now that 
soldbuch Œ 
soldbuch
 had all his military a-assignments lis
ted in there. And it was easy to 
figure out who he was and wh at he was. So
 the first thing we™d ask them is, give 
me your 
soldbuch
. And they would hand it over and 
you had them right there, that 
was Œ now you knew. And so then  you 
would say, oh you were from the 338
th

Füsilier-Batallion
(ph)
, 
yeah? And he™d  say yeah, and take it from there. Most of 
the interrogations were actually not difficu
lt. Most of them talked. Now you ran 
into some, officers ma
inly, who said name, rank and se
rial number, that™s all they 
would give you. Bu t ag
ain, you Œ we Œ all of us, I th
ink, found ways to Œ to break 
them. For example is one thing, a German
, regardless of whether you were friend 
or enemy, respected rank. So you made su
re that the insignia you were Œ you were 
wearing at the time, an d we had a complete
 collection of it, we
re at least one rank 
higher than the man we had, and we could 
read that. So we Œ we
 played that game, 
it was Œ if you had time for it. Now a lot of 
Œ mo st of it was right up in the front 
lines, so you didn™t have time to Œ to play  
games. And at those times we would just 
play tough, yeah. Threaten, all kinds of 
things, you know, we 
would Œ we Œ we™d 
say Œ we™d tell them, okay, we™ll let you wa
lk back home, right through the front 
lines. Of course they wouldn™t do th at cause
 they™d get shot. An
d things like that, 
and they  would Œ I don™t really recall a
nyone I could not break in an Œ in an 
interrogation, and I™ve interrogated thousands of them. Now, what we did with the 
information, and we Œ we Œ in my  case,
 being in the front lines, I would Œ my  
targets were who was opposing us, how 
strong are they, where are they located, 
what kind of weapons 
do they have, where™s th
eir artillery. And I would 
immediately call in to artillery 
to give them the coordinate 
of locations so that they

could fire on it, and my  infantry  units that
 I supported would get all the information 
Œ the Œ the intelligence officer
 of the unit would get all 
the information that was 
relevant to who Œ wh
o was on th e other side of the line, what was their mo rale, how 
Œ how strong were they, what kind of wea
pons did they  have. And that went Œ well, 
we had a lot of good results. One of the th
ings that I and my  team always did was 
when we had specific targets that we coul
d identify, after we had pushed thro ugh 
the area we checked those target
s to make su Œ to see if 
they had been hit like we Œ 
and I think most of them were. So, it was Œ in
 Normandy
 it was Œ is rough, cause 
we were going from hedgero w to  hedgerow
, you know, one hedgerow at a time, 
and you know, a hundred Œ a hu
ndred yards a day, things lik
e that. But after that, of 
course, on the run, that was a little diffe
rent. Once we broke through, it was Œ it 
was a different story, it was easier then. 
Q: You mentioned in your interview for the 
Shoah
 Foundation that British 
intelligence was superior to American inte
lligence. Can you clarify that point for 
me? 
A: Yes, I Œ I went to Œ I was shipped to
 Eng land
 in Decemb er of 1943. I was in 
England
 until Œ until 
D-Day
, so th at was six months from Œ in
 England
. And at 
the time I was sent to Œ from where we we
re out in the near Œ in the country 

somewhere, I was sent  to 
London
 to study with Œ with British intelligence. They

had some schools and they Œ th ey took 
us into Œ and gave us some Œ some 
information. The British had a lot more
 experience. We had absolutely no 
experience, we were new. We were Œ all of
 Œ not Œ I™m not just talking about the Œ 
the front line type intelligence, but the 
OSS 
didn™t exist until just about that time. 
And they  had never, the people in the 
OSS
 were not what the British had trained 
for years and years as intellig
ence officers. We all learne
d fr Œ by Œ by doing. The Œ 
I had some contact with 
OSS 
people afte Œ on Œ well,
 on Œ actually still in
 Europe
, 
but on th e way home. They  we
re going home at the same
 time, an d I listened to 
some of their stories. They were droppe
d Œ one particular I reme mb er, who was an 
artist, or at least that is what he Œ he
 faked. He was of Italian descent, a New 
York er who spoke Italian.
 He was dropped into 
No rma ndy
 and he sat around 
painting. He was Œ to the Germans he was 
an Italian painter visiting here, and was 
friendly right, to Œ 
Italy 
was a friendly country. And th at™s the way he collected 
intelligence. But he said he ha
d absolutely no idea what 
he was doing when he first 
got in th ere. He got in by parachute, 
got Œ the French help ed him Œ French 
underground helped  him. And 
then  he Œ he sat aro Œ he 
tha Œ he started painting and 

reporting and th ey had equipment to 
Œ to report. And he was around 
Normandy
 
and the 
Sherbrooke
(ph) peninsula doing this artw
ork. Course na Œ he brought 
nothing home. He all gave that to Œ to 
his French comrades 
there. But again, no

experience. Everything was Œ whatever we did was done for the first time, on the
 
U.S.
 side. And now, as I said, the British, 
of course, had been doing their in-
intelligence work, collection of
 intelligence all over the wo
rld with the Œ with the 
colonies and all that. So Œ a-and in World 
War II, of course, they
™d been in the war 
for three years before we came in, or almo
st three years. That
 was wa-why I said 
that their Œ their intelligen
ce was better, they were better 
organized. We were just 
learning, but we got there. We Œ just like 
everything else, I think, in the Œ in  the 
U.S.
 Army . That army  had ab solutely no 
experience, we came from all over the 
place. Nobody Œ there were no real soldiers
 at th Œ in 1941. By 1944 we did the Œ 
the biggest Œ biggest job ever done in any 
Œ any invasion. And it 
was successful. So 
I guess as Americans, we™re Œ we™re quick 
learners. We picked
 up an awful lot 
from the British. They were ve
ry helpful. They taught us
 then. The schools that I 
went to in Œ in
 Lo ndon
 during that period were ve
ry informative, because we 
talked to people who had been th ere, who ha
d been there, done that and to ld us how 
Œ how th ey did whatever we were doing la
ter on. That™s Œ that™s about Œ that™s 
about it for Œ on that. 

Q: You mentioned that you learned some
 things on your own and you were 
successful in Œ in your interrogations. 
And you mentioned one thing that they 
didn™t teach you was to have your prisoner Œ

A: Strip. 
Q: Œ get undressed, right. What othe
r kind of things 
did you improvise? 
A: Well, there are Œ there were Œ for exampl
e, the Œ the Œ wh at they didn™t teach us, 
they taught us that 
e-every soldier has a 
soldbuch
, but didn™t tell us what to do with 
it. That is we picked  up ourselves. I Œ I 
picked up the first one I looked at and I 
said, there it is. And I asked the man ha 
Œ you were up with Œ I told him, I didn™t 
ask him, I told him, you were up from this 
and this regiment, or this Œ and th ey said 
yes. And before that you were something 
else. One of the things that we did was 
when  Œ when time allowed, was engage in 
some small talk. Sma
ll talk about, well, 
you got your family back home, and th
at would open up suddenly , and then  you 
lead into other things. I had some intere
sting interrogations. I 
had Œ and this is Œ 
this is one in a Œ in a Œ in a billion, prob
ably. Had a prisoner, this Œ we were about Œ 
we were in 
Germany
 at the time. And he had very
 little information, but he was 
willing to talk. He said tha Œ actually, he dese
rted he told me. I™m n o t sure that that 
was right, but it didn™t matter. But I noticed 
in papers that he had on him that he 
was a medical student at the University of 
Vienna
. And so I asked him a Œ whether 
he was Œ took an atomy from Professor 
Bernkopf
(ph)
 Versowzer
(ph) and his 
mouth opened and he se Œ di
-di-ta-ba Œ how Œ but how 
did you know? I said, I™m 
an intelligence officer, I know
 everything. And he just 
couldn™t unde
rstand why, 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

and then  he started opening up and told me
 all kinds of things about what happened 
to his family and others. His mother-in-law was mentally  incompetent and sh e was 
in Œ in 
Vienna
 in a place that was known to me, 
that was the insane asylum in 
Vienna
, there was one big one. And sh e had been
 killed, and he told me that they 
were killing these Œ well, ha
ndicapped people, me
ntally handicapped. Theydidn™t 
need them, so they 
killed them. And you know, he 
was mad and so he said he 
deserted. Well, took him a long time to desert. 
But th Œ it-it™s that kind of thing th at 
Œ that those are interesting little things th
at happened. There we
re many of them, of 
the different nature. For example, in the Ba
ttle of the Bulge, the unit I was with was 
holding one of the Œ you know, the corn
ers of Œ of the thing. We were not 
penetrated, but we Œ we Œ we went in ther
e to hold it, and that was in the famous 
Battle of the 
Hürtgen
 Forest. And there was a German
 lieutenant colonel in there 
with his troops, hold ing out. And we could 
Œ it™s a dense forest and we just couldn't 
get him out. And one day one of Œ a couple 
of Germans came out with a white flag 

and said that they™re curren
tly Œ name I Œ I can™t rememb er the name , but it was a 
rather, later on, well known in Œ in Œ in 
the history of the war. What was his name? 
Well, can™t remember. Anyhow
, so who was sent in to 
bring Œ yeah, he was sick. 
He was very sick and he wanted to surrend
er. And so who was sent in to bring him 
out, of course? The only one who spoke Ge
rman. And in I went and I got him out 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

15
and we had Œ the man had pneumonia
 
very  badly. Bu t Œ and, you know, 
interrogating him at this point was really 
not necessary. There was nothing he could 
tell us in the Œ in the presen
t situation. Bu t he was on his 
own, just started talking as 
we carried him out. His own men carried 
him on a stretcher. And we came  out of 
the forest and then we waited until he was ev
acuated. And he just
 told us all kinds 
of war stories, was just  great. Good 
info rmation. Not ne
cessarily tactical 
information, but strategically important of how decisions were made and all that. 
Well, we took th at down and got it back 
to higher headquarters and I don™t know 
what they did with it, but at least the information was th
ere. So these were the kind 
of things that you fell into occasionally. 

Q: Did any people that you in
terrogated know you were Jewish? 
A: Yes. Some of them, I to
ld them. Particularly the 
Waffen SS
. I wanted them to 
know, because I Œ I knew that the Œ well, 
it put some fear into
 them. Although, I™m 
not sure that they were anywhere near a
ny of the atrocities or anything like that. 
But the 
Waffen SS
 was a tough outfit, in the begi
nning. Not in th e 
Œ t-towards the 
end of the war, they filled in the blanks 
in Œ in the Œ the bl
ank spaces in those 
organizations with just about anybody, in
cluding, I think, I™m not sure whether I 
told that Œ to ld you that story earlier 
about the boy, about 
a 17 year old kid who 
told me that he was an American. I said, oh 
yes? He said  yes. He said, take off my

boot. Took off his boot, took out an inners
ole and came out with a green card with 
a baby™s picture on it. His fam
ily had gone Œ had co me to 
America
 and his parents 
were in Œ in 
Lo s Angeles
. Yeah, came to
 America 
in the Œ sometime in the late 
20™s, early 30™s, I guess. He was a  baby 
then, and was a small Œ small Œ small child. 
They  applied for a Œ th ey became perman
ent residents and probably, his parents 
later, citizens. But he was sent to his grandmother in 
Germany
 to go to school, 
they wanted  him to go to school in 
Germany
. Well, he did, he went back, and war 
broke out and when  he got to 
be about 16 or so they pul
led him in, this was towards 
the end of the war. And there he was in a 
Waffen SS
 uniform. That thing made the 
newspapers, by the way. I ha
d Œ happened to  have somebody wh en I Œ I called the 
thing in. I said Œ I said, I™ve got
 Œ I™ve got an 
Œ an American 
Waffen SS
 guy here. 
And I told my
 G2 
about that, and apparently there 
were some Œ I think Associated 
Press newsmen there, they wanted to see us
. They say, hold him there, we Œ we™ll 
be right down. They took a 
picture. I still have a clipping at home of that and 
talking about Captain 
Stein
 talking to Œ to  this kid, whose showing his Œ that he 
was an American. Well, he was still a pris
oner of war in a Œ I guess we Œ we had to 
process him that way, cause 
he was a German soldier.  
Q: When did you realize the 
full extent of the genocide? 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

A: Not really until the e
nd of the war, until about 
V-E
 day. When we Œ when I 
talked to some people in Œ well, some Germ
an s at that point, we were at the Czech 
border Œ no, that was afterw
ard. We were still on the 
Elbe.
 And we had some 
communication with  the Russians, who had 
come across many of the concentration 
camps in the east. And they were telling us
 what they had found. Millions of people 
killed and although we had in
terpreters, Russian 
interpreters, we had a meeting ta Œ 
even before 
V-E
 day, it Œ it was in late April, we were on the 
Elbe
 and we stopped, 
and the Germans stopped on the other side, 
that was agreed that
 we would Œ that 
Elbe
 was the Œ the Œ the border between th
e two zones. And we
 had arranged and I 
was invol Œ I was included in that with 
our general Œ meetings with th e Ru ssian 
general. We got together and we spent a couple of days of just talking thro ugh 
interpreters. And that is th
e first time that I really 
found out what had happened. 
And of co urse, my  parents were on my  mind,
 and not only my  parents, the rest of 
my family, too. That™s
 when  the search began. Of course, after 
V-E
 day, I could not 
Œ I wanted to go to 
Vienna
. Figured that Œ I knew Œ I had known  that my  parents 
had been deported to  
Lódz, 
because in Œ it was two week
s after I went into the 
army in Œ in October ™41, I got a postcard that is Œ it came to 
New York
 and to my 
Œ the second cousin who lived in 
New York, 
or Œ was my  Œ my  ad dress that I had. 
And he brought it to me and saying that
 a postcard had co me saying that my

parents were being deported
 in October of ™4 1, to 
Litzmannstadt, Lódz
, to the 
ghetto. That™s the last inform
ation I had. After that, nothi
ng. And so I wanted to go 
to 
Vienna
, but the army wouldn™t let me. As 
an intelligence o
fficer, the Russians 
were in Œ had Œ had 
Vienna
 at the time and that part of 
Austria
 and they wouldn™t 
let us go into  the Ru ssian zone. So at that point I decided I™ll go home, to 
New 
York
 at that time. And by October Œ the war 
was over in March Œ in Œ in Œ ex cuse 
me, in May, May the ninth, excu se me. A
nd we were Œ my  team was pulled out in Œ 
in July and sent back to 
Paris
 where our headquarte
r Œ military intelligence 
headquarters was. First to Œ to another place in Œ in 
Germany
 and th en to 
Paris
. 
And we stayed there for shipment home. Ther
e were lots of things at that point, we 
could have signed 
up as a civilian to ci
vil government and all the things that were 
going on, but I decided my  best bet wa
s to go home and start looking from Œ from 
that angle, and if necessary I™d come back
 as a civilian and of course, I intended to 
get out of the army , which I did in 19
45, and I was separated in Œ in the 14
th
 of 
December, 1945, and signed on as a reserv
e officer. I stayed on in the reserves. 

Q: What was your rank wh en you Œ i-in Decemb er ™45. 

A: Captain. Yes, I started out, of course
, in ™41 as a private. In ™43 I went to 
O.C.S.,
 became second lieutenant, was promoted in 
No rma ndy  
to first lieutenant

and later that Œ a little later in the 
campaign to captain on two battlefield 
promotions.  
Q: In your previous interview you menti
oned that your father had been in th e 
military. Did his military career ha
ve any impact on your career? 
A: No, none, none whatsoever. I have a 
few photos that we
re given to me by 
relatives after the war, who had survived. 
Was my father in uniform, wa Œ one of 
them with Œ with him in un
iform and me in a Œ in a baby carriage, and my  mo th er, 
of course there too. So those Œ those are 
Œ that™s about the only th in Œ we talked 
about it, but that had no influence on me.  
Q: After World War II, did you ever consider going to  
Palestine
? 
A: Yes. Yes, there were a number of things 
that I was just thinki
ng about in Œ in the 
end of 1945 and early ™46. As a matter 
of fact, I was thinking about going to  
Palestine
 when I was still in 
Vienna
. I was signed up for a transport, one of those 
youth transports in Œ back in
 1938, immediately after the 
anschluss
. But when the 
opportunity came to
 get away to 
Luxembourg
, I couldn™t wait, that Œ that was a 
long s Œ a long, draw n out process. 
They weren™t going anywhere. We met 
periodically, all the Œ well, some of us, 
but nothing happened. 
As a matter of fact, 
my  Œ one of my  cousins, about four years younger than  I, who stayed on then , 

didn™t get out until about a year later. It t
ook that long before the transports went,

that™s just about 1939, in the fall of 19
39 th ey finally got them out, then through 
Yugoslavia
 and then  on a ship and in-into a Œ well, the Œ the 
Ex odus 
story. Bu t Œ 
into 
Palestine. 
I couldn™t wait. I was Œ I was too old. I was 18 an d I was in 
immediate danger so I left. Yes, I wanted 
to  go and I Œ and grew up in a Zionist 
idea. A-After the war I was Œ yes, I wanted to go, I Œ I thought of going. I also 
thought of going back to medi
cal school, and I was accepted
 in 1940 Œ 19 fift Œ ™46, 
it Œ in 
Switzerland
, in Œ both in Œ in

And I had asked 
you about if you had consid ered going to

 and you were telling me that 
you did have some Zionist thoughts 
and you were cons
idering going to 
Palestine
 
and also you were cons
idering medical school. 
A: Right. In early ™46, I was consider
ing both of these thin
gs. And in Œ I was 
accepted. I had written to and sent my Œ my pa
pers to Œ o-of my previous studies to

and depending on sp ace av
ailable, whatever. And at the 
same time, I had Œ this was 
now early 1946, and I had talked to a lot 
Œ lot of people, you 
know, after returning 
and I found out how all these people made al
l this money, in all kinds of things. 
And I said maybe I ought to do Œ make a 
little money, I had no
ne. I had whatever I 
had saved from my  army  pay, which wasn™t 
very much. I wasn™t working, I had not 
found a way to Œ to  do anything and so  I 
said why, why don™t I do something else 
first? So I Œ I dropped 
Palestine
 and I dropped medicine a
nd I went into the export 
busin ess. Opened  my  own busin  Œ I took Œ we
ll, first of all I had to learn something 
about the export, and that wa
s the big thing th en that I Œ I found out. And I had to 
learn something about it. Fortunately i-
in the newspapers I found a two week 
course that would teach me all about it, and 
that™s exactly what I did, I Œ I went Œ I 
mean, this is strictly an 
amateur performance at the tim
e. I went and took a two 
week course and I knew all about it, I 
knew how to  Œ what kind of documents you 
needed, and how Œ and all I n
eeded now is to find out 
what I was going to  sell and 
where. Well, I and a fr Œ a Œ a wartime bud
dy of mine, fri end, we™d been through 
the war together, and I, decided we™d go in
to the export busin ess, and we did. And 
we si Œ decided that the electrical applian
ces were a good thing, we Œ I guess we 
liked electrical appliances, so we went in
to  that and we deci
ded th at we would do 
South America Œ 
Latin
 America
 as Œ as our target. That, we had read was good 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

22
place to do, and we did. Went into busine
ss, we Œ we got in contact with some 
manufacturers of appliances, and we went 
to various embassies and asked for their 
importer Œ lists of importers, which was av
ailable. And we started writing let Œ by 
that time, by the way, I had taken, soon as it came back, I started taking a Sp an ish Œ 
I don™t know why, but the
 G.I. 
bill was there and I didn 't  kn
ow what else to do with 
it until I went to medical school, which would have been  Œ so I took Spanish and I 

was fairly fluent in Spanish by that tim
e, it was now middle of
 1946. By that time 
we Œ we got to the point wh ere I n Œ I 
need ed . And so I wrote up a catalog in 
Span ish, we put that up and a Œ a letter 
to all the customers and began working. 

Pretty soon we were making a little money,  not very much. Not 
enough to live on, 
but there was still a 
G.I.
 bill that helped us out with
 that. And it lasted for Œ until 
early 1948. In early 1948 th ere was a 
sudden stop of dollars
. The dollar was no 
longer available for payment to foreign countries, there was a shortage of d Œ of 

dollars, there was Œ there were Œ there were
 exchange restrictions. And so the big 
com-companies could give, you
 know, six months credit to
 Œ to compan Œ the little 
comp anies, like ours, we couldn™t give any 
credit, we worked st
rictly as letter of 
credit. They sent a letter of credit in do
llars to our bank and as soon as the ship Œ 
we could turn over the shipping documents
, that the merchandise had been  shipped, 
the bank would release the money. Well, that stopped, there were no mo re dollar

letters of credit and so we went out of 
busin ess. And th en started an interesting 
period. I didn™t know which way to turn, 
I Œ I™d never even l
ooked for a job, I 
didn™t know how to look fo
r Œ well, I Œ I knew how, but 
th-th-th Œ I didn™t know 
what. I Œ so I went around and went to
 an employment office, one of those 
employment agencies and th ey said yeah , as a matter of fa Œ it was on 46
th
 Street 
and 
Fifth 
Avenue, I remember. And they said 
yeah, we have a job. There™s Œ 
there™s a job opened right across th
e street here at a place called
 Nancy Studios
, 
hat makers. Feather hats. You know, past
ed feather on Œ on th e thing. And Œ I 
mean, I Œ I found that out
 when  I went to Œ to 
Na ncy ™ s. 
And so I went ik Œ went 
over there and they needed 
someone to run their office
. Apparently whoever had 
the office had quit Œ was running th e office
 had quit. So I went up there and 
there™re two ladies running the shop and I sa
id, here I am. They said oh yes, you™ll 
do. We Œ you know, told them who I wa
s and wh at I had done, I had my  own 
busin ess and all that. And th ey Œ they Œ th
ey thought that was 
Œ that was good, so 
my  major job was ma king up the payroll 
and invoices and making sure that money 
got to th e bank and so forth. Bu t the envi
ronment wasn™t for me. T h is was a Œ a Œ 
the two ladies was 
Nancy
 and her sister were the de
signers of these hats. Their 
clientele was Œ were all name designers. 
Hattie Carnegie, Lily Daché
, a-all kind Œ 
you know, th-the Œ well kno
wn  names in the fashion business, and they would

design sp ecial things for them, and others
. Had about 20 or 30 wo men doing the 
work, so it was not a small place. But I star
ted dealing with the clients and that™s Œ 
it was something I couldn™t take. I-It wa
s a strange Œ you know, being called 
darling by th ese floating char
acters who were dressed in 
diff Œ i-it was not Œ not my  
Œ my cup of tea. But I worked, I Œ I had 
to make a living and I was looking around. 
And Œ and I worked  there during the summe
r. I came  home one day in September, 
it was September of ™48, and I looked at 
my mail and there was a letter there from 
the Pentagon. I opened it up and it said, dear Captain
 Stein
, we want you back . We 
have a special project here which is right
 in line with your 
experience during the 
war and please call this number. So I ca
lled the number in Œ in the Œ in 
Washin gton
 and talked to a major and he said Œ 
he told me what 
it was. It was in 
the office of the chief of military history, 
translating the experiences of the German 
general staff that apparently the 
United Sta tes
 had under contract of some sorts, in 
and out of jail in 
Germany
,
 
th at were writing their heart out about their 
experiences on the eastern front in 
Russia
. And I said that sounds interesting, yes, 
I™m available. And in  Novem Œ early Nove
mber, starting in nove Œ as a matter of 
fact, the third of November, I Œ I came into
 Washin gton. Harry Truman
 and I 
came at th Œ came together. That was the day 
Harry Truman
 was elected. I came 
into 
Wa shin gton, 
back in uniform, and I was in th
e Pentagon, became chief of the

translation section of milt Œ o-office of ch
ief of military  history and I spent the next 
three years there translating and Œ and wr
iting. And by that time, of course, in 
1950, summer of 1950 the Ko rean war brok
e out, and Œ ™50 or ™51 Œ yeah , ™50. 
Well, I still had some Œ a year to go and 
Œ on my  Œ my  three yea Œ it was a three 
year appointment. And when
 the time was up, my time w as up, I was told that 
nobody gets out, there™s a war on. And I wa
s told that I was Œ but I was told I was 
going to 
Germany
, to the German side of our project. And tw o weeks later I got 
my orders saying report to
 San Francisco
 for shipment to 
Ko rea .
 And there I was, 
not exactly going to  
Germany
. Well, I went to 
Ko rea
, and went, checked in, was 
received by the officer in charge of Œ of 
that unit and Œ who sa
id, do you speak Œ is 
it Œ you came here as a prisoner of wa
r interrogator, which was one of my 
specialties. Oh, let me back up fo
r a moment. While I was still in 
Washington,
 
when I got my orders and I read this th
ing, that I Œ I was going over with the 
MOS
, 
the specialty as a Œ as a prisoner of war in
terrogator, I went down to what we called 
Korean man Œ what was 
called Korean management, we called it K o rean 
manglement
, and was talking to so me old col
onel who™d been there since world Œ 
since the Civil War, I think. Looked like 
it. And I said look, I have Œ you™re 
sending me to 
Korea
 with a 93-16. I don™t speak an
y of those languages. An d he 
said, well, we didn™t asked 
for no languages, they just 
said they wanted 93-16s. 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
26
And I said, yes, sir. I k n ew there was nothing
 Œ yeah Œ well, I ta
lk ed to this major 
and he said, do you speak Korean? I said 
nope. He said, Japanese? The Koreans in 
the Œ in the army at that time grew up unde
r Japanese occupation, so mo st of them 
spoke Œ still spoke some Japanese, too. I sa
id nope. He said, Chinese? I said, nope. 
He says, you™re another one
. I said, you mean you have mo re? He said yes. 
They ™ve been sending us 93-1
6s and we have Œ 
none of them speak Korean. Okay, 
they said, but never mind, we™ll Œ we™ll 
have an assignment for you. And I was 
assigned to eighth Œ eighth army  headquar
ters and research and Œ and Œ yeah, and 
research, intelligence research. And late
r on, couple of months later I was 
reassigned as chief of the order of 
battle, a division of Œ of eighth army 
headquarters. But the experience there was 
again, this now is December, end of 
December 1951. Cold, ice cold, bad weat
her and all that, and the chief of 
intelligence, Colonel
 Bump
(ph) when I reported in, I 
and two other reported in  at 
the same time, said well, I™ve got an assignm
ent for you, I want you to go up to the 
second in fantry division up 
in the hills and observe the air support for our infantry, 
and I™ll call you back when the time come
s. So we sat up th
ere for about three 
weeks in the foxholes, on top of these ridge
s, watching air supp
ort, getting shot at. 
We didn™t do any sh ooting then, infantry 
did. Watching the pa
trols go out and all 
that. Anyhow, we got back 
three weeks later and came in and I was this Œ the

27
senior of the three of us and so I Œ I repor
ted. We came in and we saluted and said, 
Colonel, we have a report for you on the Œ 
on the air support. 
We had put our notes 
together and wh ipped up a report. He said, 
oh, I don™t want your report, I know all 
about what™s going on up there. I just se
nt you up there because nobody wo rks for 
me who doesn™t get his feet 
wet. You know what the war 
is like, now you can start 
working on it. Was a g o od idea. Not for Œ fo
r Œ not while we were up there. Okay, 
so we Œ I Œ then I Œ I started working a
nd th Œ stayed there 
for Œ until January of 
1953, by wh ich time I have had en ough of 
the war and of the army and well, there 
Œ there happened to be a Œ a 
Œ there happened to be someth
ing that no Œ none of us 
knew. In the fall of 1952, all the reserve o
fficers got a letter saying that your Œ th-
the Œ you were extended, your 
Œ your fi Œ your army  still 
had a five year dur Œ as Œ 
of reserve officers, five years at a time
, you had to renew every five years. The 
other services had already ch anged to perm
anent. And so we did th  Œ by ex ecutive 
order, ba Œ ba Œ the presid
ent, and when the Korean 
war broke out all reserve 
officers were frozen, they ha
d to  stay in the Œ a-all commissions were extended. 
But the law expired on the first of Ap
ril 1953. So all of us who were in 
Korea
 in 
1952 had to be home and out of the army  
by Œ by the first of April, and the army  
decided th at they were going to  get us out by
 January to  give us a ch ance Œ to  give 
us time to get back to the 
United States 
and get processed out. And so we got this 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

28
letter saying we™d like you to sign up fo
r the permanent and you™ll go on and all 
that. And statistics later on came out that sa
id 66 percent of all 
the reserve officers 
said thank you but no thank 
you, including myself. And th
en in December of 1952, 
I happened to be Œ I still had an 
R 
and 
R
 leave, five days in Œ in 
Toky o
, I flew over 
to 
Tokyo
, and I ran in to some old friends of mi
ne and one of them said, wa Œ when  
you Œ wh ere you going? I said well, I™m 
going home in January . By the end of 
January I should be on the way home. And 
he said, what are you going to  do? And 
I said I have no idea. I have no place 
to go, I have no Œ 
no Œ no co nnections 
anywhere. So I™ll just go home and I™ll Œ I™
ll find something. Well, in the Œ he said, 
the Œ oh, this Œ this friend said, well hey, 
I™ve got a job for you,
 a civilian job here 
in 
Tokyo
. I™m heading up a new office in Œ on 
the first of January. There™s a new 
command being formed , the Un ited Nations 
and far e Œ and Far East command, a 
combined command and I™m head
 of the intelligence policy 
division and I have one 
civilian slot, a senior civilian and you™re Œ 
you™re it, if you want it. So I went down 
to personnel and they  explained wh at it wa
s, and they  explained to  me what it Œ 
what it pays and it paid more than a capta
in. And all the perks with it and I said 
yeah, why not. And I signed up right there 
and they say yeah, you™re Œ you™re qu Œ 
I told them Œ I had to write up what I wa
s doing and for Œ fill out a form. And they 
said yeah, you qualify. And so th
ere I was, and I stayed on in  
To kyo
 as a civilian

intelligence officer until 1955, 
when I returned home. That
 was also the time a little 
later that same year, ™53, 
when I met this air force lie
utenant, female, who showed 
up there and about a year and a half later we were married. And 
Barbara 
Kinney
(ph)
 
became 
Barbara Stein
. We were married in 
To kyo .  
Q: I have several questions, but first let 
me start with your getting married. What 
did you tell your wife about yourself and 
about your past when  you met her and 
you courted her? 
A: Well, first thing I told her was that where Œ where I had come from, and I told 
her that I lost my family an d I still didn™t know where th
ey were or what happened 
to them, which is something 
previously th at I had tried 
all the time. I tried the Red 
Cross and
 
th e
 HIAS
 and th e 
jayce Œ 
the 
JDC
, the Jewish community in 
Vienna
 
who in 1946 did send me a Œ 
a little form letter saying y
our parents were deported 
through 
Litzmannstadt 
and did not appear on any surv
ivor lists. That™s all I h ad. 
But where and what, I Œ I didn™t find until 
much later. Well, anyhow, I Œ I told her 
just the basic things. I Œ I wa Œ I Œ I coul
dn™t go into details. Those were the things 
that I talked about, oh, later on, bits a
nd pieces, not Œ not th
e whole thing. I Œ I 
don™t know what it was, but I just couldn™t.
 Of course, there was still, and I think 
now thinking back of tha Œ to that peri
od, and I™ve done this for some time now, 
there was always that, why did they  have to die and I Œ I surviv ed? And th at was Œ

30
that was certainly in Œ in 
Œ in my  subconscious mind, 
so meti mes v e ry  mu ch  o n my  
conscious. And it Œ th Œ it was Œ it was just
 difficult and unless I was asked, I didn™t 
tell. It was that way. There were many pe
ople that I worked w
ith that didn™t even 
know, that they though t oh, this guy™s from
 New York.
 Fortunately I had no 
particular accent, and so they kn
ew I™d come Œ I™d started in 
New Yo rk
, and I was 
a New Yorker, that Œ that was Œ that was a
ll they knew. And over
 the years bits and 
pieces Œ I told a little story here, when 
Œ when something ha
ppened that had a 
connection with some, but not until Œ well,
 the 80™s, wh en I finally sat down and 
wrote my  whole story.  

Q: I™d like to pause for just a second and 
ask about some of the even ts that were 
going around in  the years before the 50™s. 

A: Okay . 

Q: I wanted to ask you about first the 
Nuremberg
 trials. Ho-H ow closely did you 
follow the 
Nuremberg
 trials? 
A: Oh, I followed them very closely. That
 was something that I Œ of course, there 
were newspapers, the magazines. I had a 
couple of friends who were involved in  
that, one was at the 
Nuremberg
 trials and we corresponde
d, and he would write to 
me. Another one, a lawyer in the 
Washin gton 
office of the Œ the judge ad vocates 
office in the army , who was involved in th e 
Œ in the trials o-o-on this side, getting

the reports in and all that in the Œ we ta
lked ab out it all the time. I Œ I was looking 
for Œ for the death penalty for an
ybody who ju st walked through 
Nuremberg . 
Not 
all of them got it, but then 
ag ain, the Œ the trials went on for a number of years. 
When I was at military hist
ory in 1948, we had a British contingent, three British 
officers. Two of them people like myself, Eu
ropean s. As a matter of fact, the Œ no, 
one was German, one was Aust
rian. And one that their chief was a British colonel, 
but they were all British ar
my, and they were working w
ith us, because they were 
going th rough th e same documents and th
e same background. We Œ we also 
searched documents that Œ captured docu
ments that we had here Œ in connection 
with that. And we were looking at the sa
me documents and they  were working on 
background for the trials th
at were still going on, and so
 we had close contact and 
we followed that all Œ followed that all th
e w ay. There were not enough that were 
punished . 
Q: Did you follow the 
U.N.
 debate on the partition of 
Palestine
? 
A: Every word of it, absolute
ly, yes. As a matter of fact, I was Œ I was watching the 
Œ I was listening to the Œ that Œ the fina
l votes, I was counting votes at the time, on 
radio. I didn™t have a television. No, no, 
I guess not, didn™t have a television then. I 
Œ I was Œ I was listening and on the radio 
and I was Œ kept keepin g a Œ a pad. And 
when the final vote was tallied
 Œ again, this of course now is 1950 Œ 1947. I was

thinking of still again going to 
Palestine. 
But there were many things that Œ that 
held me back, you know, personal thi
ngs that were happen ing and I Œ it was 
always, you know, next week, I™ll think ab ou
t it next week or I™ll Œ I™ll look into it 
next week . By that time I had taken up Œ I 
had contact with my  cousin ha Œ at Œ and 
meanwhile his mo ther and father, who had gotten away out of 
Vienna
 to 
Eng land
, 
his father was Œ came o u t of 
Da cha u , 
they  released him. Moth er had gotten a 
permit to go to 
England,
 and so th ey went to 
England
, some went to
 Palestine. 
And I had seen them in 
England
 when  I was in 
England
. They had gone to 
Palestine
 so a Œ a Œ we had correspondence th
en, and I thought that I might join 
them, but I didn™t until many years later wh
en I did go over and I™ve been there 
quite a few times now.  

Q: You didn™t reflect o n e wa
y or the other on your pe
rsonal feelings about the 
Korean war. Did you have 
any personal objections? 
A: The Korean war? I theti Œ I though
t it was a waste and I think many of us 
thought that. It was Œ it was just everythi
ng went wrong. We 
Œ we were fighting Œ 
we Œ we were fighting a war, but we weren™
t. I see the same thing going on right 
today in Œ in
 Ko sov o
, where we Œ we™re talking 
about fighting a war, we™re 
fighting something. We™re not going in
 and cleaning it up, and that™s what 
happened. The troops were ready, we we
re ready, but the command, the Œ the 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

33
politics weren™t Œ weren Œ the pol-politicia
ns weren™t. It was a politician fought 
war. And that is probably why 
two-thirds of us, of the 
officers quit. That was not 
the ti Œ particularly those of 
us, and probably most
 of us at that time still Œ that had 
fought the Œ the war in Œ in
 Europe
 or in Œ in the 
Pacific
 for that matter, where you 
fought a war to Œ to win. There we didn't fi
g h t to win, we fought to Œ to sit around 
and let somebody do the talking. And so now I Œ I-I did not thin
k kindly of what 
was happening there. 
Q: What did you think about 
the developing Cold  War? 
A: The Cold War, of course that was so
mehow predictable, that having met the 
Russians, we knew we weren™t going to be
 friends, although we were friendly and 
the vodka flowed freely, but that was not 
it, and then  of course when the Ru ssians 
dug in and said Œ and dictated to us practi
cally wh at Œ wh at we Œ wh at we could do 
and what we couldn™t do, that was pretty
 mu ch the beginning of the Cold War, and 
Churchill
 saw it and Œ and it happened. But there were Œ there were many things 
that Œ well, it was a political war, it was Œ 
and political wars don™t lead to anything, 
never have. And there should have b
een some accommo dation so meplace, but 
nobody would give, we didn't give, they di
dn™t give. And I think the only th ing that 
Œ that Œ that could have
 ended Œ th e way it ended was Œ it was completely 
unexpected, I think. The only other wa
y wo uld have been  a Œ a hot war. 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
34
Fortunately, it didn™t happen, but it was a bad time in history, I think, that whole 
period of the Cold War, because it had an
 influence on Œ on ev
erything, on Œ on the 
lives of all the people in 
the wo rld, on the economy and Œ so that it was Œ it was a 
bad thing. 

Q: I™m going to ask you clarify the t Œ the term hot war. 

A: The Œ the missiles. The missiles were rea
dy on both  sides, we could have fired, 
they could have fired. Any mi
stake could have triggered an
 annihilation of Œ of half 
of the world, and that was a great fear, I th
ink o-of my self and I™m sure of mo st of 
the people, that some nut would push th
e wrong button, even by accident, not Œ it 
could have happened . That it 
didn™t happen, was a miracle. 
Q: What comes to your mind about 
the time that you spen t in Œ in  
To kyo ,  
other 
than that you met your wife and got married? 
A: In
 To kyo
? Well, I had gotten out of the army, 
I was a civilian in a culture that 
was strange to me, and so I Œ I soaked it a
ll up. I took it in and it was an interesting 
experience. And after about 
two and a half years there,
 I decided it was enough. 
Well, we both decided that was enough and 
let™s get out of here. But it was Œ it was 

interesting. There was nothing that stands
 out, just learning and lo oking at the ways 
of Œ of the my sterious east. 
Korea
 was a loss,  there was no 
Œ no Œ nothing th ere to 
look at, there was tota
l devastation and Œ but 
Tokyo
 and traveling around 
Japan
 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

35
was interesting, see how people lived, how 
Œ how they  Œ how they  managed, really, 
with their Œ their culture, 
the way of Œ of life, th
e way of living in  Œ in  
[indecipherable]
 paper houses, and it was intere
sting, but nothing outstanding. 
Q: Did anybody there k
now you were Jewish? 
A: Yes, yes. Yes, they knew I was Jewish
. I had no problems with that. We had a Œ 
actually the only Jewish services we had in  Œ in Œ in 
Tokyo 
were the holidays. And 
in the chapel center, we™d go
 there and they  brought in 
a rabbi from someplace, not 
sure where he came from. And I went to
 services, and I took time off and my 
office, all the people I wo
rk ed  w ith  kn
ew where I was. S o , no, there was no 
problems there.  
Q: You left 
Tokyo
 and then what? 
A: Left 
Tokyo
 and came to 
Washington
 after cruising around th e 
United States
 
for about oh, a good two or 
three months. We landed in 
Seattle
 where 
Barbara
 has 
an aunt and cousins and we stopped 
there for a few days. Then went to
 San 
Francisco 
where she has another aunt, we visite
d there and I got introduced to the 
family. And then we went to 
Iowa
, to
 Webster City, Iowa
, a great metropolis of 
about 8,000 people and I met the parents.
 Parents knew who I wa
s, I had written to 
them. As a matter of fact, just very recen
tly I went thro ugh so me papers that when 
Œ her mo ther died some years ago, but we
 had never looked through that file of 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
36
papers that Œ that we had taken from 
her, and I looked  through some paper and 
there was the letter I wrote 
to them when I first met 
Barbara Œ 
or wh-when we 
decided to  get married, and I wrote to them
 and to ld them who I was, and got to Œ 
to 
Webster City 
and well, had parties and met Œ 
met the whole town. And stayed 
there for awhile and then went to 
Washington
. In
 Wash ington
 I was then for the 
first and only time Œ no, I ca Œ I Œ was not 
the first and only time,
 my first job in 
Œ 
in 
New York
 was, course, I had to look fo r a job. Bu t coming to 
Wa sh ing t on
 was 
the first time that I really
 had to  Œ really had to lo
ok fo r a job. There was no Œ no
 
HIAS
 to  Œ to help me out. And I had a Œ well, in Œ wh ile I was in Œ in
 Tokyo, 
in Œ 
in Œ in my capacity as Œ 
in my  job, I had very close contacts with the 
CIA
 people 
out there. And so before 
I left th e chief of the 
CIA
 group asked Œ 
said, why don™t 
you Œ wh en you get home, w
hy don™t you just stop in a
nd talk to the people in 
Langley 
and come with us? And I said, well, that
™s nice and he gave me a letter of 
recommendation. And so I did and they offe
red me something that was not for me, 
they Œ th ey offered me a job in
 Œ in Œ a Œ a temporary job in 
Germany
 and I wasn™t 
ready to go out Œ out again, I wanted to 
stay awhile. And so I didn™t take that. And 
then again, by contin uous luck , ran into 
a friend who said, well oh, I know of a new 
outfit that they™re forming at the Œ in th
e Pentagon and I™ve applied for it. He was 
work ing somewhere in the Pentagon. He sa
id, to transfer into
 it and they™ve got

37
slots open, why don™t you try that? And I tr
ied it and I got the job, became his boss. 
John 
has never forgiven me that, but we™re 
still friends. And there I Œ I got the job 
with Air Force Intelligence and 
worked with 
them for oh, several years. Got several 
promotions, I was doing well. Then  our organization was taken over into the 
Defense Intelligence Agency wh
en that was formed, and th
at took in units from all 
the military  agencies. Stayed
 with them from ™62, I was involved in  Œ in th e 
creation of the new organization, was on 
that committee, and 
stayed with them 
until ™65 when once again I was 
invited by the State Depart
ment to transfer to the 
State Department. It happened during a Œ a 
meeting. I was presenting a project that 
we had Œ a worldwide project of intelligence
 handling that we had, I was involved 
with through an inter Œ th
rough an interagency committee. The State Department 
representative said, would yo
u be interested in coming 
to our Œ we have nothing 
like that. And I said, well, make me an offe
r I can™t resist. And he said the Œ about 
two weeks later, he made me that offer. An
d I transferred to the State Department 
in the foreign service and became a fo
reign service officer, coming in on top, 
which, much to the Œ in th
e foreign service that Œ yo-you™re Œ you™re not liked if 
you come in on top because everybody el
se came in on the bottom. So I had in-
interesting experience.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A
 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Cha rles Stein
. This is tape two, side
 A
, and 
you had been telling me about
 your ch anges in your professional life with the Air 
Force Intelligence and Defens
e Intelligence and then th
e State Department. Could 
you walk  me through some of those jobs
 and what your role was, your duties, 
responsib ilities? 
A: Yeah. In Œ I Œ I mentioned th at this was a new project that my  friend to ld me 
about in the Air Force Inte
lligence. What happened was 
the air force was the, in 
1955 was getting into the Œ 
the technological age of info rmation processing. They 
were the leaders in the thi
ng. They  had come up with a 
project that was worked up 
with 
IBM
 and 
Ea stman-Ko da k,
 a comb ined project of information processing 
where the information, that is documen
ts, would be photographed on microfilm, 
and at the same time, there would be an 
encoding placed on the microfilm and the 
coding was then read electronically from 
the film, and would Œ and when  you Œ 
when you got the right Œ righ
t thing, looking fo r a specific document that contained 
a subject matter, th-the subject matter was 
coded. And that was on there, and that 

would Œ that then would prin t out th e do
cument that pertained to whatever you 
were looking fo r. That was a Œ a new way of
 doing it, you didn™t have to have any 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
40
Œ any input, typewriter input 
that you had until that time
. We had to  type punch 
cards and whatever, or type it into the co
mputer and then  it would come Œ you Œ th 
Œ this way you could just ph
otograph it. Well, it was a n ove
l thing, and that is what 
they Œ th ey were hiring peop
le to do that. My job, I b
ecame a Œ I was hired as the 
chief of the coding section, and I work ed 
with the tech Œ technical part, the Œ the 
contractors on what they  were doing and 
to make sure that we™re do Œ and we 
developed Œ and again, we did this with the 
CIA
, a Œ a code Œ a code dictionary, 
sort of. An inte
lligence code, that for everything that
 was of interest to intelligence, 
would have a code number. A
nd then we would have Œ th
is was my section then, 
readers read the documents that were 
coming in, intelligence documents, reports 
from all over the world, and numerically c
ode what was in that document. That 
document would th en be photographed with 
the code input also onto the film, and 
it was available for Œ for retrieval. We 
had gotten that thing,
 it took a number of 
years to Œ to do this, we wo
rked from ™55 to ab
out Œ by ™58 or ™59 we had the first 
installation, and it worked. We 
then expanded that to the re
st of the air force, and I 
went out to help the installation of the thing at Œ in 
Omaha
 at the Strategic Air 
Command. And in 
Ohio
 at the Air Force Research and Development command and 
several other places, and we 
started sending out 
copies of what we had made the 
film into those. And those were little ch
ips, photo chip s that ran through just Œ 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
41
similar to Œ to punch cards running thro ugh
 when you™re searching, but these were 
photo ch ips and wh en  you got a hit it would 
extract it and make a full copy of it. Or 
you could view it on a Œ on a microfilm view
er. That was the main project. Now, it 
Œ we got into Œ more into different arra
ngements. That unit then was taken over 
with a lot of the other air 
force intelligence into the 
Defense Intelligence Agency 
when that was established. And I was still
 in charge of that, but I was working on 
new developments, now we were into com
puter information, handling a comp uter. 
It was all intelligence handling. I was not, at
 that point any more
 directly involved 
with the intelligence, but 
with the technical operation. And it was that, and 
DIA
 
just a follow on to th
e same thing. And it was that th
ing th at State Department got 
interested in. And when I go
t into State Department, agai
n ,  th ey  fo rmed  a sep a rate 
unit to start an information processing op
eration in  the State Department, they 
didn™t have any. As I found out later, th
ey didn™t want any. The fo reign service 
offices, they didn™t want to ha
ve information. He wanted 
to have what he had, his 
pieces of paper and he™d make
 up his own mind, they didn™
t want anybody else to Œ 
to shove stuff at him that he didn™t see Œ 
had seen Œ hadn™t seen before, to change 
his mind possibly. Anyhow, that was an Œ th
at™s an interpretation. But I got to the 
State Department and we started, there were 
about four or five of us that had been Œ 
some from the State Department 
and a couple of people from 
CIA
, myself from the 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
42
IAA
, and one from 
USIA
, and there was one other Œ a couple from the State 
Department, and we all sat and we started 
looking at what is it that the foreign 
service Œ tha-that the State Department needs in the Œ getting information. Where 
do th ey get their information from and how 
could we put this 
into a system? In 
other wo rds, we were systems developmen
t. And we then  got money thro ugh a Œ 
probably  my  mo st grueling and demeaning ex
perience in my life. I h ad to testify 
before Congress, before a congressional 
committee. It Œ the man, my immediate 
superior in that particular thing, was lost
. He and I were sitting there, I was in the 
left hand seat. The left hand seat is the 
Œ when you™re facing the committee is th e Œ 
the secondary. I was the one 
with the information, he wa
s the one that answered the 
questions. And a certain congressman from
 Brooklyn
 destroyed my  buddy. The 
man was so confused he didn™t know wh
at to say and the chairman of the 
committee excused him and said at this 
point you™re not answering any more 
questions, but your sidekick an sw ers the qu
estions, so let him answer it and you™re 
excused, and he wal Œ had to leave the Œ 
the committee room. I sat there for the rest 
of it and I got through it and I got the 
money. So Œ however, was an interesting 

thing. I was noticing that the chairman™s 
assistants, the Œ not a congressman, one of 
Œ his Œ his office manager, wi Œ whoeve
r he was, had an interesting head  
movement. And being a good ob
server, I had noticed that
 when they asked first 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
43
questions and I was watching that, and I no
ticed that when he expected a positive 
answer to something, his head would go
 this way. And wh
en  th e co ng ressma n  
asked a trick question, the 
guy went this way. So my
 eye was on him, and I got 
through the thing, it worked. I was right, th
at that was the way, that he knew Œ 
these people know the answ
ers. When they ask a ques
tion they know the answer. 
And so Œ they want confirmation of thei
r knowledge, and well anyhow, it Œ that Œ 
that was Œ it was Œ it was a sad thing. I ca
me out and poor guy outside, I asked him 
to go home. He wanted  to go
 back to the offi
ce, I said, you sh ould go home. I™ll call 
you later, I™ll tell you what happened. He sa
id, but di-di Œ do 
you know wh at Œ I 
said, yeah, we got the money, we™re all 
Œ you™re all right, go hom
e. He went home 
and I called him later on and 
he had calmed down, and he 
said, he-hell, I Œ I can™t 
even remember what happen
ed. And very shortly after that he left the State 
Department, you know, fortunately there 
was some higher up sitting in the back 
listening to this thing and th
ey weren™t happy with him,
 so anyhow. Well, we got 
the money and we had the department hi
re contractors, some of these big 
information processing firms. They came in
 and th ey started work ing on a program. 
The program was, oh about half way throug
h, and we got mo re money, because we 
showed that it was good. This time we didn
™t have to testify any more, it was done 
in the higher-ups. And they Œ let™s see, 
after about Œ it was about two and a half 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
44
years into the Œ into the prog
ram, that there was an intern
al thing. Again, there™s a 
political thing. The assistant Secretary of 
State I worked for and another assistant 
Secretary of State, who wanted that unit, 
the other one, th-the Œ th e enemy there, 
the other one was the assistant secretary 
for administration, who had the computer 
operation of the State Department, the pa
yroll, in other word s. Payroll and 
personnel and whatev er, but 
never anything subst Œ s
ubstance Œ substantive in-
information, they™d never ha
ndle it. But they saw someth
ing that hadn™t Œ that got 
money and all kinds of possi
ble Œ and they wanted it. Well, it was a time when my 
assistant secretary wanted another job. He 
wanted to be a Œ wh at do th ey call that? 
A diplomat in residence at the university
. We had Œ the univer
sity, they have a 
diplomat in residence, that a Œ that™s a 
cream puff, abso lutely. 
And usually that led 
to an ambassadorship. People
 who were s Œ who were selected for that. Well, he 
was pretty close to that, he wanted an 
ambassadorship  eventu ally, and he want Œ 
but there was a job that he could have had,
 but they kept him be
cause he had th ings 
going on in his o-operation that were notfinished, they  wouldn™t let him go. So  he 

changed. He sold us a Œ he sold  my  Œ 
my  organization to administration. And I 
said, I™m n o t available for that. You can tran
sfer it, but I™m Œ I™m o u t. I Œ I wouldn™t 
work for those people, I Œ well, I knew them
, I had worked with them before. Well, 
he was friendly enough to say Œ he was Je
wish, by the way, the only other Jew in

the area. And he said, I didn™t
 think you would, but I™ve 
got another job for you, if 
you want it. We have a new insp ector ge
neral and I™ve told 
him about how you go 
about doing your investigations and how 
you can do th ese things and Œ and he™s 
interested in you, because you™ve reviewed
, you know what this whole department 
is doing, you™ve done a survey 
to  Œ to find out what they  
need, and he wants to talk 
to you. And he™s Œ he
™s brand new, he just came an
 Œ an ambassador who ju st came 
back and got the job as Inspector General. 
So I made an appointment, went to see 
him and he said, yeah, I want you. And I 
became a senior foreign service inspector. 
Now again, I shifted jobs without try Œ ev
en trying, you know, I Œ I Œ I was asked 
to. And when I got into the Insp ector Gene
ral™s office, that I hadn™t used before, 
cause they were not in the substantive ar
ea, I found that I was in Œ in very good 
company, because most of the senior 
inspectors were former ambassadors for 
whom there was no other assignment, there 
was a limited assignment. And so they 
became inspectors and they 
traveled around from one 
embassy to the other, to 
make sure that everything was all right, an
d they were doing, 
you know, reviewing 
the embassies, mainly. 
The idea I came up with, that so
ld m Œ sold me to Œ to the 
inspection corps was that there ma Œ are 
many things that are overlapping th at are 
not being looked  at in 
Washin gton
, th-the various bureaus, each one working as an 
independent thing, each one 
working with all the embass
ies that their Œ you know, 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
46
the European bureaus, work
ing with all the European embassies, but there™s no Œ 
no co nnection between them. They™re doing 
all kind Œ I said, I would like to look 
into that. He said that™s a great idea, 
you got it. So I started out on that and I 
became Œ I was doing Œ what™d we call that
? Well, the organizational reviews. And 
I did some of those. As I went on, I did a
ll the Œ the bureaus, and particularly those 
that covered in substance mo re than an 
embassy. The scientific bureau Œ scientific 
and Œ and technical bureau, fo
r example, had these technical attachés out there that 
weren™t talking to each other. So, ther
e Œ it was a question of Œ of getting 
information to them and Œ I mean, getting 
information between them and not just 
reporting back to the bureau and the thing ge
ts lost in the bureau. And the consular 
offices, for Œ of course, there are consulat
es in every country 
and more than there 
are embassies, and they ™re not talking to 
each other. They™re reporting in, it™s all a 
one way flow, nothing goes out Œ oh, ex cuse 
me Œ to Œ to all the others. And so I 
started working on that and I usually got 
a couple of other officers assigned to me, 
some of the junior officers that were also
 working with the inspectors and we sat 
down and we ju Œ started interviewing an
d looking in to th e records and all that, we 
find out how things were and sort of rewr
ote the Œ the Œ th e job descriptions. The Œ 
the job 
[indecipherable]
. I had one particular one that was of great interest to me, 
having been  a refugee once, and th at was,
 I came across, while I was looking at

these various organizations in the department
 of a special assistant to the Secretary 
of State for Refugee Affairs. When I look
ed into that I found that the man was a 
political appointee. He™d made big contri
butions to so mebody and he had a few 
people in 
Washin gton
, but his wo rk was being done in 
Geneva
 at the 
U.S.
 mission 
to the United Nations. In the process I also
 found that there was a sp ecial assistant 
to the Secretary of State for international 
Red Cross affairs. Now here we have th e 
international Red Cross, a British a Œ a 
Swiss organization, and they have a one 
man office with one secretary who™s a sp
ecial assistant and who handles contacts 
with that. But the intern
ational Red Cross is in 
Geneva
 and who handles the Œ the 
br Œ the work? The office in 
Geneva
. And this is a large offi
ce in the united na Œ in 
the mission to the United Nations. The 
U.S.
 mission. And I found a third one, a-a-
another special assistant for a humanitar Œ 
for Œ not for humanitarian, for disaster 
relief affairs. Again, all of them political 
appointees. Well, I went Œ so I went to 
Geneva
 and talked to the people there and 
looked and see what they were doing 
and they  were hardworking people. They 
were doing the budgeting for Œ for these 
various operations. They were representing the 
U.S.
 before the United Nations and 
before all the various organizations that 
physically handled refugees and disasters 
and so fo rth. And I came back and I wrot
e a Œ oh, about a 200 page report. This 
was about a six months affair. I wrote a rit 
Œ I wrote a report and I said, reorganize

the whole thing and my  s Œ my  recommenda
tion was that Œ to get another position 
as an assistant Secretary of Affairs for Hu
manitarian affairs, all this comes under 
that subject heading and abolis
h these special assistants. Have
 Geneva
 do the work 
and have 
Washin gton
 have a Œ a regular office doing whatever is necessary in the 
United States
, such as you know, budget Œ ge
tting Œ getting money and so  forth. 
And that was finished in 1990
 Œ in January  of 19 four Œ f
our Œ 1974, I finished that 
particular report. And then I went on a
nd was doing Œ I think the next one was 
consular affairs and I was just about finish
ed  with consular affairs when  one day I 
get a phone call from the ref
ugee office. The depu
ty to this politi
cal appointee was 
a regular foreign service officer whom I kn
ew , I had contact with. And he calls me 
and he said, I have a problem. We™ve seen 
your report and I think it™s great. They 
thought they were getting to 
be the assistant secretary job. They  were Œ they were 
the biggest one, of course. An
yhow, we tha Œ we thought we Œ we have a Œ we have 
a problem, our man in 
Geneva
, our Œ the head of the office
 just informed us that he 
is retiring in August. This is
 about the fifth Œ I think it 
was the day after the Fourth 
of July weekend, I™d just 
come back. And he said, you™re the only one who knows 
what™s going on out there. 
How would you like to go to 
Geneva
? And my  an swer 
to that, and I remember that
 to this day and will alwa
ys remember it, was don™t 
bother me with details, send five tickets. We
 had a meeting after that, he explained 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
49
to me what this problem was and I said 
yes, I™ll Œ I™ll Œ I™ll accept and I™ll go. And 
six weeks later we were in 
Geneva
 and I was running that office. And I™d gotten, of 
course, I was at the time Œ this Œ the main job of that particular office really, was 
handling the Russian refugees that were 
comi ng out by about 20 or 30,000 a year. 
That was the beginning of the Œ the major exodus from
 Russia
. What they were 
doing, and I was doing for the next four
 years was dealing with th e voluntary 
agencies, 
HIAS, Tolstoy 
Foundation, the Internati
onal Catholic Migration 
Commission, the Wo rld Co uncil of Church
es and many others. The Œ the Po lish 
American refugee, or Czech Am
erican. All of those, all over 
Europe
. They  Œ tho Œ 
they were physically receiving these refuge
es, most of them, of course, Jews. A ll of 
them, probably. And were trying to resettle them in 
Israel, 
in the
 U.S.
, in 
Australia
, wherever. And my job was 
to make sure that the 
U.S.
 money th at went 
to these agencies for handling that, was pr
operly used, that they were doing their 
job, and make sure that they were doi
ng wh at they were supposed to do in  the 
resettlemen t process. And I learned a lo
t about Russians during that period, and 
others, but mainly the Russian
s. Went to one of my  jo
bs and the family was in 
Geneva
, the kids were in international sch
ools, which was a good experience fo r 
them, and my  job was making Œ reviewin
g the budgets, reviewing their budget 
requests and changing them where it was ne
cessary. They were all in flated, of

course, the usual thing. I was the first Œ 
first stop. And Œ and 
actually, physically 
looking at them, periodically. So every month 
I would be in one or Œ or two, I™d be 
in Œ in Œ in 
Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, 
and I™d be
 
in Œ in Œ in 
Munich
, wh ere many of 
them were. In 
Ro me, 
which were the main parts and occasionally in 
Mo sco w
 and 
then 
Bucharest
, behind the Iron Curtain then , talking to our people. And 
Turkey
 is 
Œ it was another place. 
Italy. 
Several places in 
Italy
 where they Œ these people 
were, and working with them
 to expedite the process.
 I had one critical, really 
critical thing. That was, the 
Kurds
 in 
Iran, Iran
 would not let them out and it was 
a long process and finally they wouldn™t let 
any Œ finally they decide that yes, they 
could leave and so we would 
Œ wanted to send in a plane and they  wouldn™t allow 
us. And the international Red Cross, I invol
ved them in it, and the international Red 
Cross was going to  send in  a plane and they
 wouldn™t let them. And finally there 
was a Œ a charter from Œ 
Lufthansa 
had a charter service and the international Red 
Cross managed to get one of their planes, 
and they gave in. No w, these people were 
to be brought out, the Œ th
ey Œ ere Œ ira Œ ara Œ Iranians gave in and let them go. 
The people Œ the Œ the law, there was a 
special law that Congress enacted to let 
these people into the 
United Sta tes 
but it expired on a certain date, which was 
about Œ we were one day away from that 
date when the thing 
Œ when the Iranians 
gave in an d the Red Cross took the plane over, got the people up and got them to

Frankfurt. 
I went to 
Frankfurt
 to work with ou
r consulate to mak e sure that these 
people get their visas. It was just Œ they
 had to get their passports stamped. That 
was it. What ha Œ wh
en they go
t to the 
United Sta tes
 was unimportant, but before 
that date Œ oh, this was the day. I get to Œ to 
Frankfurt
 and they ™re processing it, 
doing a good job, and they s
till got about a Œ about a hundred
 people at five o™clock 
in the afternoon, the consul Œ the 
U.S.
 consul says well, 
we™re gonna have to 
continue that tomorrow, we™re going home. 
I said no, you™re not. He said well, 
yeah, but you know, the day is
 over. I said, the law expires at midnight and as far as 
I™m concerned it™s mi dnight in  
Washin gton
, not in 
Frankfurt
. And it is five 
o™clock an d it™s noon, we got 12 hours to go,
 you™ve got to finish these people. He 
says no, I can™t do that. I said, I w ant a lin
e to the assistant secretary for consular 
affairs, whom I knew well. I had done a jo
b for her before I le
ft and we had good Œ 
good relationship. And he 
got Œ he says okay, so he got the line through. He 
couldn™t refuse me, so he got the line. And 
I talked to the lady and I said, I™ve got a 
reluctant 
[indeciphera ble]
 I™m Œ we™re doing the 
Ku rds
, and she said yeah, yeah, 
how you doing? I said we Œ there™s still a
bout a hundred  left that have not, and Œ 
been visa™d and your man he
re wants to go home, he wants to close up. Sh e said, 
let me  have him. I said Œ handed him 
the telep h one and I notice his face getting 
longer and longer and he hu
ng up and he said okay, we
™ll work until it™s finished. 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

Well, by about 10 o™clock that
 night we were finished. 
Everybody had their visa, 
stamped with today™s date Œ with that day™
s date and the next day we got them on a 
plane and sent them to the 
U.S.
 Bu t those are the kind of things that you Œ the 
troubleshooting type things that Œ th at 
you had to do ev ery once in aw hile. Had to 
intervene in 
Ro me
 with the Russians. The 
Russians in Œ in Œ in 
Rome
 were treated 
very nice, they had th em out on the Œ 
on the li Œ li Œ just 
like they have in 
New 
York
, in 
Brighton Beach,
 they all live out there. In
 Rome 
they had them out on 
the Œ on Œ near the 
Lido
 someplace Œ not
 Lido,
 whatever the beach is. Nicely 
quartered. Then you came 
into town to Œ and
 HIAS
 was handling mo st of the 
Russians in th Œ 
Ro me. 
And they walked in  and he sa
id Œ and their Œ their Œ their 
questions were, where is my  money, wh er
e is my  house, where is my  servants, 
where is my wi Œ the Russian way. The 
Ru ssians were used to asking fo r some Œ 
the government. The government gave them. 
They were still in that mode. And we 
had some serious problems there, the peop
le were intimidated by them. And I told 
them, don™t be intimidated, you™ve got Œ th ey
 had Ru ssian speakers there, and they 
were Œ I Œ I Œ I told them how Œ how to ta
lk to these people. Ju
st yell at them. Tell 
them to go away, they  get nothing. One mo
re word  out of you and you™re out, you 
get nothing, you go wherever you want to
 go. And it Œ it work ed. It work ed, you 
know. Again, something th
ey were used to. The
 KGB
 wasn ™t going to be Œ talk to 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

53
them friendly like, so we weren™t eithe
r. They  had something coming to  them. We 
told them that no, you don™
t have anything coming to you, we™re giving it to you 
because we™re good people. An
d in that particular case, and there were a lot of 
them there, the wo
rd got to all of
 them, I was the 
United States
 government. I 
represent Œ see, those were just an 
organization. Wh en  I came, I was the 
United 
States
 government. Well that Œ that made Œ 
that Œ that Œ that did it. When the 
government says you gotta 
be quiet, you™re quiet. So we™re Œ you know, it was 
game playing, but Œ it was Œ it 
was acting. I did not go to 
Hollywood
 after that. 
That™s Œ you know, experiences like that
, that was Œ that was my job. And of 
course I saw a lot of misery too, people
 coming out and having to sit in those 
camps in some areas, they 
were not too pleasant. Some 
intellectuals, people with Œ 
who had status and Œ 
and now were begging, in eff
ect. I felt for them, but on the 
other hand, I was there too, once, and I 
knew how they  felt. So, you know, you 
treated them accordingly. You 
talked to them, and particul
arly in some cases when 
I talked to them, I told them who I was, 
and I said, I was in your position once, and 
look at me now. It™s gonna happen to you
, just take it easy. It™ll be done. We™re 
doing it, but it takes time. And it helped
 a little, some cases, I Œ I hope it did. 

Q: I want to go ask you a few questions 
about the 60™s. I know you™ve taken me 
professionally in your career 
through the 70™s, or through 
the mid-70™s at least. I 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
54
would like to go back  to the 60™s and ask 
ju st some other questions. First of all, 
wanted to  ask you ab out the 
Eichmann
 trial. Did you follow the 
Eichmann
 trial? 
A: Oh yes. I followed that 
again, with a vengeance, 
and I read everything there 
was, anything from the
 ﬁWashington Post
ﬂ to the ﬁ
Jerusalem Postﬂ 
and anything 
I could lay my  hands on, because it wa
s of great interest. I had known  of 
Eichmann
 of course, like everybody else did. 
By that time I had read most of the 
things that had been written about the Ho
lo caust and ab out Œ about that. And I was 
hoping that it would lead to wh ere it did.
 And when they
 executed him, I Œ I was 
happy. It™s the wrong way to be happy, but 
I was happy. Not, in 
that case, that was 
the exception. Just like I did for the 
Nuremberg
 people. 
Q: The 1960™s were very turbulent years in  this country , a lot of changes. I™d like 
you to reflect back on some of th
e things from the 60™s, like the Œ the 
Vietnam 
war 
an-and Civil Rights, and Wo men™s Moveme
nt. Did you get involved with any of 
those, or are any of those of 
particular interest to you? 
A: No, I was Œ well, put this way. In 19
65 Œ no, ™66, I™d just gone to the State 
Department. No, no, no, fift 
Œ ™65, I was still with the 
DIA. 
I received a letter from 
the army, saying that the Secretary of Defe
nse has declared your jo b an essential Œ 
a civilian essential position. Therefore, 
you can no longer remain in the active 

reserve. I w as still a reserve officer. By th
at time I was a lieutenant colonel. And I Œ 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
55
i Œ i Œ well, let me just quick
ly here, when I said I left 
Korea
 and we said no thank 
you, we don™t. When  I got back  to 
Washington
 I applied for commission again. I 
decided I Œ I want to stay in, mainly beca
use it Œ that pays, at the end. I had never 
known until 1957, ap proximately ™57 is wh en
 I came back in, that reserve offices 
who had active duty at age 
60 would get money. And 
I said well, why not? 
Somebody talked me into it, 
really. Somebody told me abou
t that, one of the people 
I wor Œ I worked with
. They said, why don™t you come 
back in, and I went down to 
Fort Myer
(ph) and said, can I come back in? 
And they said, of course. And I Œ I 
came Œ I-I was reassig n ed on the non-pay 
unit. We met once every two weeks in 
the Pentagon for a couple of hours, get a 
lecture from somebody or gave a lecture. 
And that was it, we got points, that™s all. 
So anyhow, in 1965 I 
got this letter saying 
that your Œ you™re essentia
l now and you can™t be in th
e reserves any more, in the 
active reserve, but you have over 20 years,
 and so you have a choice to go in  the 
inactive reserve or into retired reserve. And 
Vietna m
 was just brewing and I said, I 
don™t want to get caught in another war. Even
 Œ even then I might 
Œ this Œ this thing 
ad Œ ba Œ my civilian job might end, a
nd I™ve had two wars, 
two is enough. And 
Vietnam
 didn™t look like anything that I shou
ld get involved in. And I said Œ I 
wrote back  and said no, put me in the Œ in
 the retired reserve a
nd I retired at that 
point. And at age 60, the checks started 
comi ng, which are s
till accepted. But 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
56
anyhow, now 
Vietnam
 I did not like wh at was going 
on. I couldn™t see it. There 
was Œ I didn™t think we had any business th
ere. And I had friends
 who were still in 
the service who went over there and th
ey came back and th
ey told me what 
conditions they Œ that
 they had, under what conditions
 they were there, and it was 
not what I Œ I felt that I was right, we shou
ldn™t be there. And I had Œ I felt for all 
the people that Œ that were against the 
war and all that, al t h ough you know, I was 
sort of a military something or other, not
hing serious. But that
 wasn™t it and many 
of the people I knew who were
 in the military  and in the 
reserves and retired in the 
reserves all felt like I d id, so I-I wasn™t alone. And I Œ I Œ well, we were right, it 

came out the wrong way at the end. 
Q: I™m going to pause now and change tape. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Cha rles Stein
. This is tape number two, side
 B, 
and I wanted to ask you ab
out the Civil Rights movement and if you had any 
thoughts about it, especially in light 
of your experience in your earlier years. 
A: You know, the Civil Rights moved me, I 
followed it very closely. I didn™t do 
anything, I was not involved  in anything,
 but it was on the right track, and I was 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
57
very much sympathetic to it, because I™d been there 
and I thought that all the 
segregation an-and th ing were Œ was Œ it was 
awful. I had seen it,
 I™d Œ in Œ in the 
military, and I Œ I™d seen it in the south. Mo
st of my early army posts were in the 
south and I saw how the blacks lived, or were
 forced to live, a
nd they were forced 
to do whatever, were not allo
wed to  Œ not really allowed to
 live. And so yes, I was, 
as I said, symp athetic and I watched it and 
was happy to see that it developed into 
finally the Œ the schooling and the Œ the de
segregation of the schools particularly to 
start with and Œ and then the 
other things that followed.  
Q: By the 1970™s, 
Israel
 had already been in volved  in
 several wars. I wanted to Œ 
to have you reflect on Œ on th
at aspect of it Œ Israeli hist
ory. The ™48 war, ™56, ™67, 
™73, the Œ this Œ the wars.  

A: I was very mu ch concerned and watc
hing it very carefully, all the wars, the 

whole history of 
Israel
. It was Œ well, it Œ it w as the homeland for all those who 
didn™t have a land and a place any more. And 
what was left of my family was there. 
My cousin, his mother and father. And then
 a little later on, anot
her cousin who had 
survived in
 Bucharest
 that I didn™t know ab out then 
for Œ for some 
time, til after 
the war, quite a bit after the war. She came to Œ to
 Israel
. So I had direct 
connection. I also had some friends who had gotten to
 Israel
 early in the Œ well, 

some left actually with their 
families in the 30™s, before the 
anschluss
. And others

had gotten out in the tra Œ in the various tr
ansports or in the illegal migration. And 
so Œ and of course, they  were my  people
. I watched those wars
 and I followed them 
very carefully and was overjoyed with all 
the results, because each one of them was 
a victory. I almo st got involved  directly 
in Œ well, I did get involved in  a way, in 
the Yom Kippur war in ™73. I was at th
e synagogue in ™73 on Yo m Kippur, when 
the thing Œ th-the news came.
 I rememb er it was in a Sunday, I believe. And I had 

airline tickets to 
Israe l
 for Monday. On Œ as a job, 
I was supposed to Œ I was still 
an inspector then, and I was to in
spect the immigration policies of 
Israel
, again ka 
Œ that was still during the Œ the time when
 I was working on th
e Œ on the refugee 
and the humanitarian affairs 
study. And I was headed for 
Israel
, I was headed for 
Israel, Lebanon 
and 
Jordan
. I had two passports in my  pocket, one for 
Israel
 and 
one fo r the other countries, because you co
uldn™t have a stamp then, and th-that Œ 
in the State Department we did all kind
s of things, you know. Two diplomatic 
passports and I just hoped that I rememb
ered  which pocket 
I had wh ich one in 
when I pulled it out. But I was to Œ to be in
 Israel 
on the Œ on the f Œ the following 
Œ well, I was leaving the following day, th
e day after Yom Kippur. And of co urse 
when I came home that night, I called th
e State Department. War had broken out 
and there was no way to go there. And I ca
lled the Œ th e Œ the duty officers, and I 
asked them to get a telegram to our embassy in 
Tel Aviv
 that Œ and Œ and also to 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
59
Leba no n
 and 
Jordan
 that because the situation th at I was not coming and I™ll let 
them know when I™m coming, 
it would be a little later. If 
I had left a couple days 
earlier, I would have been right in the mi
ddle of Œ of a six day war. But I Œ the Yom 
Kippur war, I mean. B u t I Œ I was just save
d by Œ by one day. I did get there again, 
oh, ab out the following month. It was an interesting thing, I had to  go to  Œ to 
Jordan
 and there was a Œ when I got to 
Israel
 I said, well, I™m going to have to go 
back to 
Greece 
and then fly into 
Jordan
. And they said no. Said the 
Allenby
 
bridge, which is the famous bridge wh
ere the crossings occurred, the Œ the 
exchanges and all that. They 
said, we have a deal with 
Œ Israel
 really has a deal 
with 
Jordan
, war or no war. We can get you to 
the bridge, and on Œ it was a certain 
day, like Tuesday or Wednesday, but 
the Œ one of the o
fficers from Œ from 
Amman 
is coming to 
Jerusa lem 
across the bridge, and he Œ the embassy will take him in 
their car to the bridge. They
 will cross Œ he will have to walk across the bridge and 
we have a car at the bridge to pick him up.
 So we™ll just tell th
e embassy in Œ we™ll 
just call 
Jordan, Amman
, and we™ll tell th em that you™ll be crossing the bridge at 
the same time, you™ll be in the car that Œ pi
ck him up and th ey co  Œ they™ll pick you 

up on the other side. You™re just gonna ha
ve to carry a suitcase by yourself across. I 
said, well that™s no problem. And so that
™s how we went a Œ went across that 
bridge. And it was interesting, I got a trip through all of the Œ the territories there, 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

60
the new territories. Well, they weren™t new 
any more. But anyhow, got there, got to 
the bridge, went across. Said hello to
 the guy who ca Œ came in from Œ from 
Jordan
. Went across and got in the car
 and got to the embassy in 
Jordan
. And 
from there I could go to 
Lebanon
 and finished up my trip
 and then went home. So 
that was an interesting experience. I didn't 
expected it to be that way, but I did get 
to use both of my  passports.  
Q: I want to get back  to your professional 
life now, you had take
n me up to the year 
1974. What happened
 after 1974 in your professional life? 
A: Okay, 1974, I was Œ I had finished the 
report on the refugees and so forth, and I 
got a phone call in my  office asking Œ te
lling me Œ from Œ from the refugee office 
that the Œ their man in Œ in 
Geneva
, who was really running the whole operation 
for all these different groups, was retiring. 
He had just informed them that he was 
retiring and the man called me, said you™re 
the only wa Œ you™ve
 Œ you wrote the Œ 
the book. We like your report and would 
you Œ how would you 
like to go and take 
over in 
Geneva
? And my  answer to him was, please don™t bother me with details, 
send five tickets. And fi Œ si
x weeks later we were in 
Geneva.
 I took over that 
office and we had oh, about 20 or 30 peop
le working in there.
 There™s a lot of 
bookkeep ing Œ well, a lot of it was ha-ha
ndling the Œ well, okay, th Œ my  Œ my  
duties were representation to the United Na

United Nations, the high co
mmissioner for refugees, the 
U.N.
 high co mmissioner 
for disaster relief, the international Re
d Cross and all the other international 
organizations that had any d
ealings with Œ with refugees
 or dis Œ or any of the 
human Œ humanitarian affairs, includingth e human rights. I had one officer 
assigned to me who was specially doing 
human rights wo rk. I concentrated on 
directing the 
United States
 refugee program, as it was called, and my  job was to 
see that the 
U.S.
 funds that were going into the 
program were being properly used 
by th e people who were actually operati
ng the program. And now those people 
were voluntary agencies
, as we called them. 
HIAS
, International Catholic 
Migration Commission, Wo rld Co uncil of
 Church es, Polish American, Czech 
American refugee organizations, 
Tolstoy 
Foundation, in Œ in Œ International 
Rescue Committee and others. 
They had places in various
 parts of Europe, where 
they would receive the refugees, they w
ould come m Œ and th
ose Œ this is the 
period when we had the Russian refuge
es coming out. They were coming out 
between 20 and 30,000 a year in those y
ears. They would house them, feed them 
and process them and help them get to thei
r final destination. We tried to get them 
to 
Israel
 but not all of them went. Some Œ some went to
 Israel, 
others made it to 
the 
United States
 and 
Australia
 was another major point. Others stayed in
 Euro pe
 
or some in 
Germany
, and various other places. But 
with all these people there was 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

the need Œ the Œ needed  money, and th e 
United States 
supported that. We also 
supported 
Israel
 in the settling of the Russian re
fugees. We supplied money for the 
build ing of housing and 
teaching them language, teaching and whatever was 
necessary to ink Œ to get them
 into Œ into the main stream
. So my job took me to Œ 
to these Œ to various places where the 
Œ wh ere the people were being actually 
processed. And I saw to it that our money 
was used properly, that it wasn™t wasted 
on ad ministration or wh atever it was. We ha
d all the Œ all these organizations also 
had their own fu nds, but you had to wa
tch them, of course, you know, money Œ 
money is available so you use it any 
way you Œ you feel like it until somebody 
looks over your shoulder. Also, I had to lo
ok at their Œ their annual budgets when 
they Œ th eir budgets would co
me to me, I would check it to
 see if it was justified 
and then  pass it on to
 Washin gton
 to present to Congress. I made the first 
corrections and then  
Wa sh ing t on
 cut some more, and wh
atever. These Œ these 
things happened, of course, it™s the usual w
ith the budget process. But the Œ the best 
part of that was I traveled and I Œ I saw a 
lot of these people and my  points of travel 
were what Œ 
Paris, Rome, Vienna
, all hardship points Œ ports. 
Munich
 was a very 
heavy place, lots Œ ma ny of them came through 
Munich
 because many of the 
organizations had th eir headquarters in 
Munich 
for some reason or other. Some 
came through 
Frankfurt. 
And occasionally I would go Œ
 Istanbul
 was another 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

one, and occasionally 
I would go to Œ to 
Bucharest
 and to
 Moscow
, because Œ to 
talk Œ to work with our own people, th
e emb assy people, to find out what the 
governments are up to and how they are 
handling Œ because they were handlin g 
some of the guarantees to the local govern
ment that they would be going to the 
United States
 and once they got out we 
tried to get them to Œ to 
Israel
. But 
anyhow, mo st of that, it was Œ was a very interesting job. And having been  a 
refugee once, I Œ I could Œ I knew what
 these people were going through, and 
wherever we could help, I Œ I helped.  

Q: How long did you continue in th is position? 

A: Four years. I was there for exactly four
 years. My family was with me and the 
children went to an intern
ational school in Œ in  
Geneva
. And it was Œ it Œ it Œ it was 
a dream assignment. I had planned on retiring,
 I wanted to stay another year, and so 
I asked Œ I put in a request for Œ to extend
 me for one more year. And they came Œ
 
Washin gton
 came back and said, as a matter of f
act, we™ve just cut this down to a 
three year as Œ for your Œ your Œ the ne
xt. There are too many people who want to 
go to 
Geneva
, so from now on it™s going to be 
a three year assignment, not a four 
year assignment, and Œ and we can™t extend 
you for the fifth year. I told them that I 

would retire, one more year and I retire. So
 in 1974 in September s Œ in Œ well, we 
came home in Œ around the first of August.
 1974 I had some leave Œ ™78, excuse 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

64
me, ™78. It™s been a few years, but ™74 is
 when I got there. Okay, we came home. I 
had leave and when  I got back
 to work, I was assigned a 
Œ well, I was told that I 
had a choice of assignments, but my  Œ my
 first as-assignment wo uld have been  
with the new office that I ha
d originally pr Œ created in
 that Œ the inspection report 
that I™d written. The assistant secretary fo
r humanitarian affair
s, and I would have 
been a deputy in there. Bu
t I didn™t Œ I rejected that because the other person who 
was in the deputy Œ in the 
assistant secretary™s job, we™ve had some differences, 
major differences and I woul
dn™t work for that person.
 And so I said no. As it 
happened , someone else had found out that
 I was on th e way back and had said if 
possible, could I get assigned to  that offi
ce, and th at was the Office of Consular 
Affairs, which was the last report I did in
 Œ as a Œ an inspector, and Œ someone I 
had dealt with also on refuge
e affairs and other things. And th e Œ so I went to that 
office, and they told me th
at they had Œ wh a Œ wh a -- what my  plans were and I 
said, I plan to retire, I h ad decided I 
retire the end of the year. December, I™m 

through. Got three months, that™s it. And th
ey  say well, we just have a job for you, 
exactly for that. There is a presiden
tial commission on the rewriting of the 
immigration laws. And we have to send a 
State Department representative to that. 
It is Œ it is a Œ in Œ physically locate
d in the Justice Department. And how would 
you like to represent us? And I said, do 
I know anything about the immigration

laws? They said, of course you do. I said
, in that case I™ll Œ I™ll go. I took that 
assignment and I spent mo st of my next tw
o and a half months over at the Justice 
Department with Œ oh, the Justice Depa
rtment, the Immigration-Naturalization 
Department, we went over all the immigra tion rules and laws and all that to see 
what would happen, wh at should be done
, and I put in the State Department and 
put Œ wh ich I got from Œ from my  people, I went back to state, but whenev  Œ 

whatever questions came up, I checked with
 the department, see what their position 
was and brought it up and we wrote that re
port, went in Œ it was supposed to  be 
finished and to Congress by the end of th
e year. We finished up and it was going 
into the typewriter on about the middle of
 December, at which time I said goodbye 
and I left, I never read the report, I ne
ver saw it afterwards. I knew what was in 
there, but it didn™t go an ywhere anyway . It
 was a Œ it was as a lot of these reports 
go, Congress does whatever they want to 
do. I went back and went through th e 
process, out-processing thing, and th
en th e last day of Decemb er, the 30
th
 of 
December, last day was a Saturday, I think. 
So on that Friday 
I said goodbye to 
everybody and got a plaque for the wall 
and hung it on it Œ went home, hung it on 
the wall and it™s been catching dust ever si
nce there. I retired. That was the end of 
my  Œ my  govern ment career. 

Q: Tell me about your children. 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
66
A: My children. I have three sons. 
Jeff
 was born in  1978, and well, having once 
been a medical student, I had an opportunity
 to  read the book again and brush up, 
because a week before he was born, and 
he was about due, we 
had a snowstorm in 
Œ in Œ we lived in
 Œ over in the 
Alexandria
 area then. And our street, there was a 
six foot snow drift at the end of th e stre
et, we were complete
ly snowed in, there 
was nothing that could go in or out, and we
 were waiting. And so I was reading the 
book and said well, if it ha
ppens, I think I know what 
to do. I remembered as a 
young medical student, as first year me
dical students will do, sneak into other 
classes, I w ent into one class once where 
there was Œ this was an obstetrics class 
and they  were observing a birth. And so
 I saw that everything th at was going on 
and I figured I can do that. Of co
urse, I was scared to death, but 
Jeff
 was kind 
enough to  wait for another week  and by th at 
time this Œ the road 
was cleared. Then 
four years later 
Jim
 came along and 
David
 a couple of years after that. I had Œ 
when  we went to 
Switzerland
, 
Jeff
 was going into his thir
d year of high school, 
Jim 
had just finished elementary school and 
David 
was going in to th e fifth grad e. 
No. Yes, yeah, fifth grade. Anyhow, so th
ey went to Œ no, he was going into  the 
third grad e, excuse me, he was going in to the third grad e, 
Jim 
was going into the Œ 
into th Œ 
Jim 
was going into the fifth grade. I c 
Œ yeah, gotta figure this out, yeah. I 
said it went backward s. And they went to
 an  international school, wh ich was very

67
useful, learned French. Had an inte
resting one with our youngest one 
David
, who 
was 10 years old wh en we got th ere. And af
ter the Œ oh, about tw o-thirds down the 
first year, the French teacher called me at
 th e office one day and said, you know, I 
can™t get anything out of 
David
, he doesn™t do his ho
mework , he doesn™t do 
anything, he won™t say anything. I don™t kn
ow what he knows. I said, well, let me 
talk to him. I came home that day and we 
lived in an apartment building, it was a Œ 
a block, four buildings around a big park
. Was a Œ a beautiful thing and th e kids 
were playing soccer down there 
and all that. And I came home and 
David
 was 
playing down there, they™re playing Œ th
ey were playing soccer and I went down 
into the park and I listene
d to Œ I was looking for 
Dav i d
 and I hear him talk. And 
this kid is talking French to his buddies 
like a native. And so aft Œ I let him finish 
the game and th en they  Œ when  he came ups
tairs, I said, hey, your French teacher 
says you™re not doing any work  in Fren
ch . And he said, yeah, well you Œ th-they 
have all this Œ this grammar and I don™t 
know anything about th
at. I said, well, you 
have to study it. And he said well, but I do
n™t need it. I can talk
 French. I said yeah, 
I Œ I just noticed that. I didn™t know you c
ould I had not noticed th at at all. So next 
day I called the teacher and I told her wh
at he had Œ what I-I observed. I said, 
please engage him in Œ in a conversation outside of the classroom and see Œ see 

what he comes up with. Sh e called me 
that afternoon and she said, forget 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
68
everything I said. He™s ok Œ 
I don™t care whether he knows gramma r or not. So that 
was an interesting experience. The other 
two of course, also learned French  and 

enjoyed Œ and first they were a little appr
ehensive when they got there, because 
they were in  a strange country and it Œ 
this was something ne
w. When it was time 
to come home, they didn™t want to leave. 
They were at home there and they  had a Œ 
when ever I could Œ I told you th at I had to trav el quite a bit. When ever I could 

arrange my travels when the kids were out 
of school, I would take the fami ly along. 
And so they got into
 a lot of places. We got there 
and I let them go sightseeing or 
take a tour or wh atever and I wo uld be 
doing my  Œ my  job. And then  we™d co me 
back and they had seen anothe
r place. We d Œ we traveled 
a lot, they traveled a lot 
and of course, what they Œ wh at got th
em about skiing, maybe I Œ did I mention 
that before when I Œ when I came hom
e the day when I got the assignment in 

Switzerland
, I Œ I called my wife and told her, 
Barbara
 this Œ we™re Œ we™re going 
to
 Switzerland
, she said, great. And I said, don™t tell the kids, we™ll tell them 
tonight. So  at dinner we™re sitting around th e 
table and I casually sort of mentioned, 
listen, how would you like Œ ho
w would you guys like it if 
we got assigned to  go to 
Switzerland
? And 
Jeff
, of course who was a Œ all Œ a
ll the kids were skiers. I was a 
skier so I Œ I taught them early. And I said Œ 
Jeff 
said oh yeah, yeah, skiing, 
Switzerland,
 yeah, that™s it, let™s 
go. And the other two chimed in, yeah, let™s go. 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

69
So, it was no problem. But then
 when they got there, of
 course, they were a little 
appreh ensive. We Œ wh en we got back 
they Œ they went back to school. 
Jeff Œ 
oh 
Jeff, 
we bro Œ took 
Jeff 
back in ™56. He graduated 
in 1956 Œ ™76, yeah, 1976.  
Q: What year was he born in ? 
A: ™58. He graduated from 
high school in ™76 and we 
Œ we had Œ we were on home 
leave, we had two months home leave, so 
we came back and we traveled all over 
the 
United States 
for a couple of months, and 
then dropped him off at the 
University of 
Virgin ia
 in 
Charlottesville,
 where he had been accepted earlier, and 
we went back to 
Switzerland
 and he then so rt of beca
me a jetsetter. About every 
three months he was in Œ in
 Switzerland
. And th e way 
UVA
 wo rks, we dropped 
him off en Œ end of Au gust wh en school started. In early Decemb er school was out 

and until about the latter part of
 January, and he was back in 
Switze rland
, he was 
off skiing someplace with his friends and gi
rlfriends and whatever. And in January 
went back . In early May school was out an
d he was back for the summer. So that 
was for a couple of years and he Œ he wa
s very unhappy that we came back. He 
liked that. 

Q: What are your children doing today? 
A: 
Jeff
 is in real estate, he has his own re
al estate firm. He is doing mostly 
commercial real estate, shopping centers a
nd big comp lexes all over the east coast.

engineer, works for 
Naval Air Systems Command.
 He is 
right now in the Œ has a special assignment in
 the office of the assistant Secretary of 
State Œ o-of the Navy. And 
Dav i d
 de-decided after high scho
ol he didn™t want to be 
like his brothers, to get Œ he™s the youngest
 Œ go to college, so he went into the air 
force. He spent about nine y
ears in the air force, got out, and then  he decided he 
wanted to be a police officer, and that™s
 exactly what he is now. He™s a police 
officer in the town of 
Vienna
, right in our neighborhood, and we see him almo st 
every day th at he wo rks, he Œ a cruiser

their first birthday. A delightful couple of
 twins chattering away , talking to each 
other in their own language. Bu t all of them are doing well. 
Q: What did you tell your ch
ildren about your childhood? 
A: For many years I wasn™t talking about
 an ything about me, except when  they 
asked a question, I would answ er it. Did yo
u Œ did you go to school? Yes, I did. 
And that was about it, or a little more. Bu
t is not until about the middle 80™s is 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
71
when  I Œ one day it sort of dawn ed on me
 Œ that wa Œ it came from some questions 
that I Œ a discussion we had with  Œ with th
e kids, that they really didn™t know me. 
They  knew bits and pieces of Œ they kn
ew who I was. They 
knew where I came 
from, they knew what I™d gone
 through, a little bit. But ju
st bits and pieces, and I 
decided that I needed to write this thingdown . I was not consciously ever holding it 
back, it was just not Œ I just Œ somehow I 
couldn™t. It was Œ I don™t know wh at Œ 
what it was, but I won™t speculate on that. 
So when the time Œ at
 that time there was 
an immediate action. I went out and I bo
ught my self a word processor and I hooked 
it up and I sat down and I started writing. 
And I started writing every day from then 
on until I had it all on paper. And so I Œ I wr
ote my Œ my whole history up to that 
point. There isn™t much after that anyway
, they know me since then. And I made 
copies and they all have a copy of it. And then  wh en I did the 
Shoah
 tape with you, 
s-soon as I got that in th e mail, I immedi
ately went down to the copy place and had 
them copy me Œ make me three copies a
nd th-they all have copies of that. And 
since then, they have Œ they have asked a 
lot of questions. More detailed. That has 

gotten th em to Œ on th e track to ask questions.  

Q: In what ways did the 
Shoah
, the Holocaust influence your professional and 
personal choices? 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
72
A: Well, it interrupted my dr
eam of becoming a doctor. 
That of course, was dead. 
And there™s still a little nostalg
ia in my mind every time I th
ink about it, I said, I Œ I 
shouldn™t have gone for the money,
 I should have gone back to 
Switze rland
, I 
should Œ well, should have, would have, 
could have, it didn™t happen, of course. 
But it is Œ other than that, of course 
there is Œ there was 
the Œ the pain. The 
knowledge that I surv
ived and my family didn™t, has always been with me, it™s 
never left me in Œ not in Œ in 
Korea
 and not in 
Tokyo
 and not of course in Œ in Œ in 
Euro pe. 
I™ve been looking fo
r the answer, and of course there is no answer. But 
also I™ve been Œ I™ve spent an
 awful lot of my waking life looking for my parents. 
There was a big gap there. My parents and 
Œ and the rest of the fami ly, but my  Œ 
my mother and my father, of course. And of
 course that™s Œ didn™t come until about 
three years ago, wh en  I was doing a Œ a 
study on Œ on Œ in the mu seum Œ in the 
Holocaust museum, and I was talking to th
e then head of ar
chives, in a casual 
conversation, and you know, mentioning th
at I had Œ who I was and that family 
was Œ was taken to Œ deported to  Œ from 
Vienna
 to Œ to 
Lódz
 and that™s when I lost 
the trail. A nd he s Œ he told Œ told me th
at, he said, we have just gotten these five 
volumes of Œ a register of all the people th
at were in the ghetto, have you seen it? I 
said no, didn™t know anything about it an
d we interrupted the 
Œ my interview with 
him and I went to look at it and I opened it, I asked for the Œ there Œ it was

alphabetical thing. Apparently the Germ
ans had registered all this. Had it in 
alphabetical order and it was found after th
e war, the Polish government had it, and 
finally got to 
Ya d Va shem
 and Œ and Œ and to the mu
seum. And I opened it to the 
S™s
 and went to 
Stein 
and there was my  mo ther and my  father and the rest of the 
family. And I found a Œ there was a date 
when  they ar Œ wh
o they were, their 
profession, their date of birth, when  they
 arrived in the Œ in the ghetto, and when 
they left the ghetto. Now, the leaving of th
e ghetto for most of them was later dates, 
and to my knowledge that was be
fore the Œ that was after the 
Chelmno
 death camp  
had been closed, that was the 
ausch Œ they were mostly to 
Auschwitz
 then, orother 
concen tration camps. But my  parents and some
 others, I noticed the Œ the final depr 
Œ disposition there is a Œ it said 
TR7. 
I remembered from my 
readings that there 
were certain time periods when th
ere were transports to Œ to 
Chelmno
. And so 
right after that I went to looking in to some
 of the other books that I had read that 
had this thing and th en I reme mb ered the first one was 
Gilbert
 and I read in there, 
there were seven transports from the 21
st
 to the 28
th
 of February , 1942 to 
Chelmno ,
 
transport seven was on the 20
th
 of February. That was cl
osure to me. I knew on the 
27
th
 of Œ 27
th
 Œ 28
th
, excuse me, 28
th
 of February, they had died at 
Chelmno .

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: Œ continuation of the 
United States 
Holo caust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Charles Stein
. This is tape number three, side
 A.
 And 
you were telling me about finding wh
at happened to your family in
 Chelmno
. Is 
there anything you wanted to add to that? 
A: Well, I found Œ well, my parents, as I said, died at 
Chelmno
. Uncles, aunts, 
cousins were there until about August and were shipped to 
Auschwitz
. I think 
pretty much all of the Austrian contingent
 was gone by that time. I Œ I Œ there™s a 
certain amo unt o-of peace that Œ peac
e that it gave me when I found out, 
particularly about my  parents, because I 
had been searching, 
what, for almost 60 
years, and with no results fo
r fift Œ 50 some odd years.
 And i-it Œ it was a relief. It 
was Œ it was definitely a relief to me to 
Œ to find out finally. And I think it Œ the 
relief really came when I sat 
down a-and wrote lette
rs to all Œ what relatives I still 
have, a couple of cousins and Œ and some 
other more distant relatives, ti Œ and told 
them about it. I now had something to tell, 
and that ended it. So that was about the 
end of Œ of that. I don™t think 
I Œ I can add anything to  this. 
Q: With what Holocaust related groups
 or organizations are you affiliated? 
A: Well, with the Œ mainly with the 
U.S.
 Holocaust Memorial Museum. I™ve been 
there for over six years now, since befo
re it opened. I started on Œ to work on

opening day in a hospitality
 suite at the Œ at the 
[indecipherable]
 
Plaza
 where 
some of the 
VIPs 
were quartered and we had a suite there where we Œ a Œ a Œ a gor 
Œ a room there where we gave them tickets
, gave them directions, told them where 
to go and so forth. Then I had to wa
it a little while until I got
 into the business 
services training program. I™d missed the fi
rst class, so I got into  the second Œ the 
next class and Œ later that year, ™93. And 
I been there Œ I been 
there ever since. I 
worked at Œ two years on the volunteer a
dviso ry board , one year as its chairman. 
And have done a lot of, well 
additional things like studies in addition to Œ to my 

regular duties there. And it™s been Œ it™s been 
a useful thing. It gives me a chance to 

talk to people and maybe add something 
to  their knowledge. Wh en  people ask a 
question, I give them just a little more 
than they asked for, 
usually. Except, of 
course, the main question, where™s the bath
room. I don™t do any mo re of that, I just 
point them in the right direction. Bu t on 
the others, if they want to know about 
where an exhibit is, I know th
ey also want to know what it is about, and I find that 
mo st of them don™t. So giving them that 
little extra information, satisfying to  me, 
and from what I can see, to Œ with people
, they like it. Th-They Œ I get a special 

thank you. So th-that has been a Œ the othe
r organizations, oh, I Œ I™m a memb er of 
the Friends of the
 Ya d Va shem
, but that™s strictly a Œ you know, a supporting 
thing. I send them my  donation and I ge
t their newspaper. And the same for the

American gathering of Œ of Œ wh at its
 Œ American Gathering of Ho locaust 
Surv ivors. I™m not anywhere involved Œ no
t Œ not involved in any chapter of what Œ 
if they have any. I contribute to them, a
nd I think it™s a worthwhile thing. I give 
them some money and I read their publicatio
n, but that™s about it. I am not a joiner. 
I™m Œ I™m v ery selectiv e in what I join. 
Q: Have you had some special mo ments or 
special experiences at the museum that 

you can share? 
A: At the museum? Oh, many, many. I 
had Œ one of them, 
I was doing groups, 
which I Œ I do mo stly groups
 now, because nobody else 
wants to do them. Now, I 
had a school group from 
France
, a Œ French  high school students, mo st Œ all girls, 
as a matter of fact. And one little girl said
 to me, with her teacher, they all spoke 
English very  nicely. And sh e said that he
r grandfather had Œ was in the resistance, 
he was Jewish, her grandfather was in the resistance, he had surv ived. He had a 
gun, a rifle, something, that he gave to the 
Smithsonian
 and th e 
Smithsonia n
 had 
given it to the mu seum, and would I know
 where she could possibly find that? I 

told her, I said, when you 
get down to the second fl
oor, when you make Œ go 
around th e first bend, there are the resistance movements, you find the French  
resistance there, take a look there. About 
two hours later, the girl came back with 
tears in her eyes, saying thank you, th
ank you so mu ch. I 
found not only my

grandfather™s gun, with his name on it and 
all that, with a label, but also some 
papers he had apparently given, some pa
 Œ passport Œ well, I don™t Œ I™m not sure 
what it Œ wh at it was, I can™t reme mb er. I 
looked at it afterwards, but I can™t Œ but 
some documents that are also 
sitting right there. So she 
found her grandfather th ere. 
It was Œ it was a heartwarming thing. I had 
another one, I was loading th e elevators, 
and it was a quiet period, and I had a fam
ily coming in around Œ what looked like a 
husband and wife and two gr
own children, children in th
eir 20™s. And I directed 
them to the Œ to the 
I.D.
 cards and said, pick up an  
I.D.
 card. The man picked up an  
I.D.
 card, and th e next Œ I was looking at 
him, next he said, oh my  God. I said, 
anything wrong? He said no. We are from 
Holland
 and I picked a card, this is a 
person from my town in 
Holland
. I didn't know an ybody was in the Holocaust in 
Holland
, in Œ from my town. So
me small town he lives
 in. They looked like 
professional people. But, and I-I-I said, well,
 th-that™s very unusual. And he said, 
oh, when I get back I will Œ 
I will give this to the mayor. We will Œ I will Œ will tell 
them that we Œ we have to do so mething,
 you know, a plaque or something for a 
person ah  Œ we didn Œ I don™t think anybo
dy even knows or reme
mbers that. I said, 
that™s wonderful, please do that. And there we
re several other things like that that 
happened that are very nice 
to know. I read Œ oh, well, an amazing thing. On e day I 
Œ I was Œ I was the information desk, and aman walked  up to me. And he looks at

me and I looked at him and he Œ some 
[indecipherable]
 looked familiar, wasn™t 
sure what it was. He said, you™re 
Stein.
 I looked at him. I said, I™ve seen you 
somewhere, way back . He says, yeah, in 
[indecipherable]
 he started speaking 
German. Somebody I knew in 
Vienna
, and as a matter o f fact I also knew him in 
New York
, but we Œ he had Œ he changed comp
le Œ I-I don™t know, he Œ I guess I 
didn™t change much, but he 
recognized me. I didn™t reco
gnize him, but I had known 
him in Œ in
 New York 
and Œ about 1939 Œ 1940, I guess,
 and then sort of lost track, 
I hadn™t seen him since about then Œ sinc
e then. So  we Œ we had a long talk. Those 
are some of the things. Vis-Visitors, I ha
ve a Œ I have my  own personal policy in Œ 
in Œ in Œ in visitor servic
es. There™s no German or Au
strian that comes to the 
mu seum that does not go and see it, I don™t care whether there are tickets or not. I 
always have some Œ my own tickets in my
 pocket. I always save some for just 
those. And I™ve had many cases where I Œ I th
ink they need to go
 see, se e their own 
history. Not mine, their history, now. An
d I™ve had some of them come back, f-find 
me again, look me up and Œ and thank me 
for Œ for letting th em see. They says, you 

know, we read a lot about it, we heard a lo
t about it, but not like 
this. I said, that™s 
right. It™s all there. I enjoy working with
 groups, school groups mo stly, where we 
go a little deeper into the Œ the subject matte
r, and I™m particularly i-interested in 
the questions the kids ask. 
And some of them are good. 
And then  I have right now 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
79
still Œ still there from last year, so I gue
ss two years now, the artwork down at the 
elevator, the basement Œ the concourse elev
ator. The first thing as you walk in on 
the left hand side is that large picture of the police statio n in 
Vien na
, the one I lived 
next door to. The one I™ve been in . And so , after we Œ I tell them all about the 
mu seum, I say, well while you™re waiting for th
e elevator, take a look at this one. It 
might give you something a little
 personal. I was in that po
lice station, I lived right 
next door to it. I been in there many times
 before the Germans moved in and after 
the Germans moved in, I was in there aski
ng for permission to  leave the country. 
And then  I get all kinds of questions. Oh, 
were you there, oh. And, you know. The 
elevators, fortunately take a long time to 
come down to  Œ to the concourse and so 
we got Œ have time to answer those ques
tions. Makes an impression, and it gives 
them one mo re dimension to  
[indecipherable]
. I also Œ I s Œ I Œ excuse me, I 
started this program, which they are n Œ 
are now continuing, o-of the Œ wh en I was 
on th e Œ on the 
[indecipherable]
 of taking people thro ugh and having su rvivors 
telling their stories at certain places that 
they™re particularly Œ that they™re Œ were 
involved  in. And I just saw 
in those latest Œ you may have
 seen that Œ that they Œ 
Pete Philips
 is now going to do it this fall agai
n for th-the paid staff of visitor 
services. And th ey need it.
 Paid staff is, you know, they™re Œ they™re the mo st 
temporary employees Œ o-of visitor servic
es, are the mo st temporaries i-in the

museum. They come in, it™s th
eir first job after college and they can™t wait to get 
their one year in to get status to apply 
fo r another job so mewhere, because they™re 
not paying them. The pay is 
Œ is ridiculous. And so th
ey ™re not putting heart and 
soul into it like we do. 
Q: Tell me about the exhi
bit of the 1936 Olympics. 
A: The what? 

Q: The exhibit from the 1936 Olympics in
 Berlin
 and wh at significance that had 
for you. 

A: The 1936 Olympics, that was in Œ oh,
 th at was interesting because I found a 
picture in there of two Œ there was a picture of two Jewish swim Œ swim champions 
Œ Austrian swim champions th
at refused to go to the Ol
ympics and they happened 
to  b e teammates  o f  mi n e, I was a memb er
 of the same club and th e same swim 
team. And that was a real surprise when  
I walked by th ere and took a look at that, 
and here they are. Interestingly, I had s
een one of them on an Au strian video of 
former Austrians™ intervie
ws, during an interview in 
Israel. 
And I saw one of them 
on th at one. Of course, now 
I wouldn™t have recognized 
her cause she™s, you know, 
50 years o Œ 60 years older than  when  I 
last saw her. And th en
 about a few weeks 
later I go down there and I see 
the way I did recognize her.  
Q: What do you make of the resurg
ence of interest 
in the Holocaust? 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
81
A: What? 
Q: The resurgence of inte
rest in the Holocaust. 
A: Well, all I can say is it™s about time. But it™s understandable that it wasn™t until 
some of the major institutions like re Œ 
Yad Vashem,
 and the 
U.S.
 mu seu m came 
into being. That™s brought it Œ 
and of course that Œ that led to all the things that are 
now going on, the Œ 
o-of payments and Œ and res
titution and all that. It was 
dormant too long, and of co
urse in my  own case, in 
Austria
, the Austrians never 
considered themselves as the first vic
tims until what, 1992 or 
™93 when Chancellor 
Vranitzky
 said hey, let™s forget ab
out that, we™re just as gu
ilty as the rest of them. 
And then  all of a sudden they said oh yeah
, yes we are. I-I mean, it Œ it took a long 
time and it is good because thos
e of us who were there or
 were directly involved, 
we™re not going to be around for too lo
ng. And now there™s a whole new generation 
coming up who will know about it. 
And I think that is important. 
Q: What do you say to Holo caust 
deniers? Ho w do you answer them? 

A: I haven™t had a chan ce to talk to one.
 And I been thinking
 about that, what 
would I say to them? And my  first impulse
 is violence, do some violence. But I 
think the best thing I can think of is to 
ridicule them, say oh,
 you know all about 
that? Well, I was there, so don™t you tell 
me it didn™t happen, 
because I was there it 
did happen, I saw it happen. And walk away
. But th-th Œ yo-you can™t engage them 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
82
in Œ in conversation really, because I think 
that is what they want. Don™t give them 
a platform. 
Q: Recently there have been some events that have ec
hoes of the Holocaust and I 
was wondering if you would 
co mment, or if you want to comment on the Œ th e 
Colu mbine 
shooting, which was scheduled  to take place on
 Hitler™s
 birthday. 
A: I-I don™t see a connection. 
Q: What about 
Kosovo 
and wh at™s happening with the ethnic cleansing? 
A: Well, there you have another Ho locaust 
going, and I think it™s a Œ it™s awful. I 
don™t, now that it™s almo st over, I don™t 
see how these people are going to  go back 
into what used to be their homes. And fro
m what I understand, many of them don™t 
want to, and I don™t blame them, just lik
e we didn™t want to go back. We could 
have gone back, I guess, and some few 
did, but not Œ not Œ not many. The same 
with them. Those who go back, it™s gonna be
 hard to Œ to liv
e with Œ with the 
people that Œ that kicked  them out. I don™
t see it. You see, it™s a very, very difficult 
situation that they will Œ they are facing 
now. Then again, kn
owing how it feels to 
take off and run and leave and 
Œ and get helped in a camp  
or Œ or Œ or another Œ or 
get a bed so meplace, or Œ or Œ it™s difficult.  

Q: I wanted to ask you to elabor
ate on one or two th ings from the 
Shoah 
Foundation
 
interview, so this is from the war 
years, from the ho Œ the years before 

 
Interview with Charles Stein

83
World War II and Œ and thereabouts. You me
ntioned the violin and Œ and how th e 
violin was significant. Do 
you still play the violin? 
A: Well, let™s put it that way, I still have 
one. I dust it off every 
once in awhile and 
I play, only it™s Œ the fingers aren™t wo
rking right any more. Oh, I play, I™m Œ 
sometimes I™ll Œ I™ll Œ I™ll Œ I™ll put on a re
cord and I™ll play along with a record, 
but not what I used to play
, not classical. Now I™ll do jazz. Or I™ll do st Œ I™ll try an 
imitation of
 Stephane Grappelli
 and find out that I can™t 
do it. No, I still have the 
violin, and I Œ I Œ well, the mandolin, whic
h is the same fingering, but it™s a little 
easier to play, cause I don™t have to play 
all Œ what I used to play. I Œ I still play 
that. I have one. I picked one up in
 Moscow
 one day, when I was in 
Moscow.
 Go t 
it for about six rubles, or something like that.  
Q: You also mentioned in your 
Shoa h 
Foundation
 
tape that you had attended Œ 
attended a lecture given by Dr. 
Freud.  
A: Yes. 
Q: Can you tell me about that? 
A: Well, there was something Œ I was what, 
about 16 or so. He was giving a lecture 
at one of the people™s university, there wa
s a Œ one of those things like Œ like the 
extension course type operations 
[indecipherable]
 and I just had to go and s Œ 
listen to him. I was at the 
time in school, taking psychol
ogy, that was one of the 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
84
courses we were taking one 
year, and oh, the Œ had to see that. And so I went and I 
saw th Œ I was Œ I was Œ I was awed. Prob
ably  didn™t understand a word  he said, 
but I Œ I Œ I was awed by be in the Œ being 
in the presence of the ma n. And it was Œ 
it was a-an experience, but it was a youthful
 experience. I Œ I don™t Œ I am Œ I have 
no idea what he Œ I can™t rememb er what he
 Œ wh at he was talk
ing about, what the 
topic was. And I pretended 
to understand everything, of
 course, like a 16 year old 
does, and told everybody that I went to see a lecture of
 Freud™s. 
I saw Œ I saw the 
man, I listened to him, and 
oh yes, he was great. And I 
don™t think I even admitted 
to my self that I didn™t understand what he 
was saying. Bu t that™s about the ex tent of 
Œ of that particular experience. It 
was a one time, about one hour thing. 
Q: On a much Œ much more serious note, 
you mentioned that y
ou had a gran dfather 
who was killed in a pogrom. 
A: Yes. 

Q: What impact did that have on you? 
A: I don™t know exactly  wh at impact it had, but I ha Œ I had found out about that, 
oh I was Œ oh, probably  about 
six or seven years old when  
I was told about it. He Œ 
he died befo re Œ long before I was born,
 about 1912, I think it was. And it Œ it was 
a sort of a nostalgic thing. Think Œ I Œ 
I Œ I thought of my  grandfa Œ I wan Œ I 
wanted to  know him. I never knew any of
 my  grandfathers. My other grandfather 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
85
had gone to 
America
, and he died before I got here
, so I never saw him. And it was 
something missing in my life.
 I Œ it was a sen timental thi
ng. But in a Œ the history 
of my Œ my mother™s family, it had a lo 
Œ a lot of impact, of course, on Œ on my 
mo ther, and her sisters, and her brother, too.
 They  never talked ab
out it, except, a-at 
least one time or a few times when Œ firs
t when Œ wh en I heard about it and then 
when  Œ when I asked a ques
tion, my  mo ther would sa
y so mething about it. My 
mother was, at the time, sh
e was about 20 years old when
 he Œ he was thrown  into 
the Œ into the well. So I™m 
Œ I™m not sure that there was any real impact on Œ on my  
life that I Œ I know. 
Q: Tell me about tomatoes and why 
to matoes are significant to you. 
A: Tomatoes. For some reason or other I 
wo uld never eat tomatoes when  I was a 
child, until I was in 
Luxembourg, 
and one day wh en I was 
hungry and th is friend 
of mine and I had ab out a franc between us
 and we passed by one of those grocery 
stands and th ere were tomatoes. And he sa
id, let™s get a couple
 of tomatoes, we™ve 
got enough money fo r a couple of tomato
es. And I Œ I looked at it, and I was 
hungry, and I agreed. And we
 took the tomatoes and Œ 
and I™m Œ he ate it like an 
apple, you know, he bit into it and it 
tasted good. And I™ve been eating to m-
tomatoes ever since. I love them. It wa
s Œ I don™t know why I didn™t eat them when  
I was a child. We had them at home, and Œ 
but for some reason or other, I Œ I Œ I Œ I 

 
Interview with Charles Stein  
 
June 8, 1999 
 

 
 
86
didn™t like them. And I guess it took a Œ a hu
ngry day to Œ an-and nothing else to 
eat in Œ in sight and that tomato looked go
od and it tasted good, and as I said, I love 
them. Even grow them. 
Q: Is there anything that I haven™t asked 
you that you would like to mention before 
we conclu de today?  

A: I can™t think of an ything offh and. I th
ink you™ve done a great
 job again, as you 
always do. Have to get that on my tape. 
No, you Œ I think you 
Œ you™ve guided  me 
through my life very nicely. Couldn™t thin
k of it any better. I appreciate it, because 

this tape, I assume I get a copy of that, I 
think my children will Œ will appreciate it. 
Thank you. 
Q: I thank you very mu ch fo r speaking 
with me today. And this concludes the
