>> M o r
ris Rosen:W ell, before the war I was well
-
known in school,because I was an athlete all the 
tim e in school.  Hadmany, m any f riends, notonly Jewish f riends, but gentile, we were ver y close.  
But everything changed in 1938 during the crystal night in 1938. This was Novem ber 8, they started 
boycotting our store also.  Although it wasn'tPoland, in southernPoland, Silesia. People that knew 
us, students thatI went to school with, they boycotted. I rem em bertwo sisters, they tooka broom  
f rom  the store, startedchasing away the ones that they told everybody, don'tbuy f rom  Jews, this, 
this, and that.  It didn't help.W e had to closeup our store. T hat's what happened.  It'sa very short

>> Bill Benson: T ell us about yourf ather'sbusiness and what h
appened to it af ter Hitler cam e to 
power in Germany.  
 
>> Morris Rosen: 
 
W ell, af ter Hitler came to power, it was ver y, ver y bad.  First of all, you have to give 
up everything.  If  it was radios,other things, valuables, people that they own storesf or so m any years 
the Germans takeover the stores.T hey closed up,and it was tough.  
 
 
Af ter 6:00 in theevening, they announce whoever is going to be caught on the streetm ight get 
shotor in prison.  You couldn't walk any m ore than two or three people, themost.  Not gathering, not 
in the church, not to synagogue. It was ver y, ver y tough.  It was restrictions, and then they m ade us 
putoff  this was

this was already in Novem ber 1939. T hey m adeus wear arm bands on the left 
hand, white armbandswith the Jewish star. This is, if  they neededany f orced labor or to do any dirty 

work when Germansm oved in some places, we had to do the dirty work.  It was ver y easy to 
recognize the people.  T his was there.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Let's go back a little tothe actual beginning of  the war, Septem ber 1,1939.  You 

rem em ber that?

>> Morris Rosen: 
 
Oh,yeah.  It was about 5:00 in them orning. I was sleeping very sound. Suddenly, 
I heard noisesf rom airplanes, I look out the window.  I mean, the sky was dark f rom the pl
anes, over 
60, what I count. They f lew ver y, ver y lo w, and the reason theyf lew low, becausethey dropped the 
f if th column, which they were dressed in civilian clothes. T hey were actually arm y people. They were 
theones that they let know the Germ an army, with assistancef rom  the Polish arm y, was s af e to go, 
where it's not saf eto go.  But thePolisharm y kepta lot of them , which they hung them  in the woods. 
T hey took off everything, except their underpants. This is sham eful,because they were not sol
diers; 
they were just like private people,notarm y. T hey didn't wear the uniforms.  
 
 
W estarted to runaway also f rom our home,because we were ver y close to the Germ an 
border.W e heardalready the canons, bom bardmentsand everything. W estarted runni
ng a wa y.   
Once you were expelled from  Germ any, f rom Ham burg to our city, but we run away.  Af teraboutf ive 
days, we were caughtby the Germ ans near the river.  T hat's whenwe started to be overcom e.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdid you find when youwent back 
home?  
 

>> Morris Rosen: 
 
Som any Jews were already killed at that the.  One was a goodf riend of ours. It 
was rough.  It was m iserable. Food, you couldn't buy any food. T here was a specialplacewhere 

Jews can only buy bread in a certain bakery, a Jewish bakery.  Andyou have to stay for hours in 
order to get bread. I was all night long hidden in the little woods,and then to be thef irst one to be at 
7:00 in them orning to stay at line. 
 
 
I came outat 7:00 in the morning, it happened that a Germanbattalion on the bikes cam e 
over, wanted to keep order.  One Polish guy, which he didn't belongto them, he said all the Jews.  I

got kicked inthe back. " You can eat thedirt. You get hom e, with nobread."  I started crying, after 
staying all night long.
  
It was tough.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Morris, you were at the startof  the work in Septem ber 1938, October, youwere not 7 

years old.  
 
>> Morris Rosen: 
 
No .   
 
>> Bill Benson:  One ofthef irst things you weref orced todo was help build a scaffold.  
 
>>
 
Morris Rosen: 
 
Yes. W hathappened, they formeda Jewish council.  T he Jewish council was 
responsiblef orevery o rder that the Germ ansgave, they have to do the dirty work.  T he Germ ans 
didn't do the dirty work.  
 
 
T hey starteda Bauleitung, a construction com pany.  You would belucky to get in.  I know m y 
father paid a lot of money. W hy?  First, we were more safenottobe sent to Germ any.  Second, you 

got a littlebit extraf ood.  My f irst job Ibecame abricklayer, painterand carpenter. My f irst job 
wa s a s 
a helper carpenter tobuild hanging scaffolds in the market.  I will neverforget this. W e didabout 10 
hanging scaff olds.  It was scary.  Then the police, Germ an police, not soldiers, wentf rom ever y 
personthey took away their IDs, youhad tohave IDs, otherwise you  couldn't walk on the street.  
You'd be 11:00atthem arket, you get back. Otherwise, you don't get back your ID.  
 
 
It happened the next day, I saw it m yself . They brought 10
 
--
 
at thefoundry, bef ore the war 
they m adeall of  the locom otives for Poland.  During the war they made parts for planes.  Motors f or 
planesf or the Germans.  They brought 10, and oneof  them  they did sabotage, that's the reason.  
T his isnot right. They didn'tdoanything. T hey did in every cit y in Silesia.  T hey hung peoplef or

sabotage which people didn'tdo, just to scare of  thepeople. That'swh y they were successful, 
because they m urdered, they killed and people were scared. That'swhat happened. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Morris, aboutthat time, I think your sister Rozia, wh o we saw a picture of,she 

escaped to Russia.  
 
>> Morris Rosen:W hat happened, she lived in Bedzin, which was 65% Jewish people.W henthe 

Germ ans cam e in about a week later, they burnedthe synagogue there. W henthey burned the 
synagogue
s, the rabbi wanted to save the holy scriptures.  They pushedthem into the synagogue.  
People were watching, because it was like aJewish city, e ver ybody was pushed in thereto the 
synagogue, andthey putfire to the synagogue.  
 
 
Next to it was a church there. T he priestf rom the churchopened the gates,m etal, he pointed 
out to people thatthey looked out the window.  Several did, about12 people jum peddown. He 
unlocked the gate, they were safe. Then theGerm ans went houseby house, chase out the Jew
s,  
then the synagogue. Machine
-
gunned it.  One of it, I met in Israel,I exhibited in Israelm y stamp 
collectionof  the Olym pics, and I talkedalso about it, what happened at the ghetto.  Said, you want to 
m eet som ebody that was right there?  You com eto them eeting.  He pickedme up, went there tothe 
m eeting, which is f rom  m y region,f rom Silesia, the room  wasf ullf rom  papersf rom the priest that 
saved the Jews.  He was one that chased out f rom the house, and he was shot,but he managed to 
run into the church there.  T he priest lockedthe door,and he showed me abullet hole here.  He was 
treated, but I took pictures, if I told the story, of the manthat actually survi ved this and lived through.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your sister went to Russia?

>> Mo rri s  
Rosen: 
 
My sister when she saw hanging Jews, 35 Jews hung in them arket, after the 
synagogue was burned, she cam ehom e, said goodbye tom y f ather, her husband, said I'm going.  
Because the Russiansat that tim e were in good things with the Germ ans, because
 
they signed a 
pact. Shem anaged to escape. She swam  through the river to Russia.  Some of them , theRussians 

sentback. She was lucky with her husband. Aboutf our weeks later, we received thef irst postcard,I 
rem em ber the stam p has ahorse that I collected stamps as a youngster.  She walked
 
--
 
she never 
knew Russian all the tim e.  She walked ina bank,and then she escapedf urther when thewar broke 

out. It'sa long story.  But it'snother story, it's m ine.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were a b
ric k la ye r f or a wh ile .   
 
>> Morris Rosen: Yes.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  Assistant carpenter. Butbefore long, you weref orced to becom ea painter. T hat 
would play a really im portant role in your survival.  
 
>> Morris Rosen: 
 
In the ghetto I worked painting.  T he Germ ans sent me away.  Inf act, every Frida y 
evening I walked to three buildingsf or the Germ ans, which was a police state.  In the thirdbuilding, 

unf inished yet,paint and everything.  Every Friday m y older brother, m yself , went through the woods, 
wh i
ch was about 20 kilom eters through the woods, and to be thereFriday evening, this wa s the 
saf estplace.  Even I have such a good ID card sometimes itdidn'thelp. 
 
 
So I was hiding at thepolice station. T his was the saf est place. But the war soon cam e
, wh ic h  
I have to skip also.  Itwas March 1942that they called all of the Jewish girls in our city f rom  12 years 

old to 30 to register, that they're going to wor k in the shopfor the Germ ans astailors, andthey should

com e register. W hoever won't register won't get any food stam ps or anything.  
 
 
T hey cam e there to the place, to Chem nitz,which was a transitioncam p, and they were 
exam ined by a doctor. They didn't let them  out no more. My f atherwent there,tried to getout. Didn't 
help anything.  
 
 
T wo days later, they shipped them  away.  Let me tell you,m y house was like af teraf uneral.  
Can you imagine a12

year

old girl, the youngest, to be takenaway.  My m other cried constantly.  My 
father.  It was like after af uneral. It was terrible. T ill
 
about three weeks later, we got thef irst postcard 
f rom her that she works in lower Silesia, in acam p, inaf actory whe re they make clothingand 

ever ything, 12 hours aday, if  it's possible to send some packagesof food. So we knew they're 
hungry.  
 
 
My
 
m other baked everything she could.  I could go to thepost off ice.  Though it was restricted.  
It was already in our city, the ghetto, which you couldn't goeverywhe re.  W e were still not in the 

ghetto. And I went to the post off iceand mailed those packages all the tim e. But the war thing 
happened,I never forget, was August10,1942. T here cam e an orderf rom  the Jewish com munity, 
5:00 in them orning, we have to com enear the Jewish comm unity there was a stadium, tobe thereat 
5:00 in them orning. Put on your sum mer clothing, so you look presentable. There you wil l get new 
I D ca rd s.   
 
 
W e waitedtill 8:00 in the m orning. It was sohot,August,the hottest season in Poland.  Kids 
were cr ying.  Of  course, they were thirsty, no water, no nothing.  Peop
le were fainting f rom the heat.  
7:00, 8:00 in them orning I thought som ething is not kosher like, to say.  Cam ethree copswith SS 
and soldiers. On the roof were already soldiers with m achine guns.  Som ething smells.  Isaw it is not

Dreier, I didpainting for him .  Myf ather too. W ecame in themorning.  They putupthreetables.  

T here cam e a selection. The one,the elderpeople, over 40, som e people younger, but they have 
beards, you know, go to the right. T othe center were people thathaven't got IDs, young people,but 
they're still able to work. W entto the center. The left is like people like my brothers and I, that we 
have ID cards, we work for the Germ ans, to the left.  
 
 
About 10:00, they f inish, they 
m
archall the people, about 2,000 of them, to Bedzin, next city.  
 
 
I didn't know where to go in, because m yf ather didn't keep them  inour home.  If ound out 
where they were in Bedzin, so at8:00 inthem orning I wentthere to seem y parents if  I can getfirst 

the key to the house. Who was there?  Jewish police, not Germ an.  They didn't letm e in.W hat do 
you want?  I knew a policem anf rom  our city.  I said I just wantfor a second.  I 
am  the re fo ra  m inu te, I 
com e back out.  
 
 
T he scene I was there, crying, I wil l never f orget inm y lif e.  I saw m y father, gave m ehis keys, 
his pocket watch.  My m other said don'tforget your younger sister, 12 years old. See to send the 
packages.  See 
that she gets the best.  That's the last tim e I saw m y parents.  
 
 
I came back to work there, I toldhim  youprom isedme m y parentswould be safe. 
 
 
Oh, don't worry.  I f ind them . Like youfound them, like he did.  
 
 
On the third day, I went backf rom work, I wor ked with m y older brother, I walked through the 
f ields, not the city.  I see som ebody wave to m e likethis. It was m y f riend's father,m y bestf riend's

suddenly a German started shooting.  So I jum ped inthere, waited10m inutes. W henI didn't see the 
train anym ore, I wenthom e.  
 
 
W ent home, thenext day I get f rom the Jewish com munity we have to move to the ghetto. W e 
didn'teven have tim e to cry af ter m y parents.  You were busy m oving. W hat can you move? W e 
didn'thave horse andwagon or anything. W e got a little two
-
wheeler. W hat did we pack?  Som e 
bedding. W e tookm y father's library, because he has a very well
-
kn own librar y, book
s,  Jewish  b o o ks 
on history f rom  the 17th century, 18th. T hisItook.W hat can youtake?  T he rest, everything we lef t. 
W ecame back to the ghetto.  W e were 16 people,nine girls, sevenboys.  Justhay on thef loor, 
woodenf loor. W e let the girls sleep there.W e went to sleep outside. When it rained, we stood in the 
foyer like this.  
 
 
T here was one lady, she was pregnant, shebegged me, she baked somethingfor herhusband 
in aforced labor camp.  This is important to you when I tell you later the story.  He was our tailor that 
actually for m y barm itzvah, if  you know what it is, he didm y suit.  He was our tailorf rom hom e.  
 
 
T o him I sent thepackages.  And then cam ethehigh holidays about a week later, we went to 
the caf e, everybody cried. Af ter that, Ihave a f riend.We werefive people, very goodf riends.  One of 
them  was ver y poor. He didn't have no parents.  He had theelderbrother that went to the Polish 
arm y.  He didn't com eback.  He probably got killed.  
 
 
He was so hungry, hedidn'thavef ood to live.  That he went as a volunteer tothe slave labor.  
 
 
So we put som em oney together.  I wentandbought some on theblack market, some beer, 
som e kielbasa, good goodoils, went to a gardenthere to som eone's, we hada little party there,and 

thatm an that was sopoor, he was so talented, he was a good singer.  Every time he saw a picture

with Fred Astaire,he did step dancing, like
,  
like Fred Astaire. I never m et him  after the war.  I have 
pictures of him .  
 
 
T hen I cam ehom e, I have a letterf rom the Jewish com m unity that this gets you on the special 
perm it, they sentm e to a leatherfactory. T here we were about eight m onths.  After eightmonths, 
they were only in thefactory two Jews.  One was the chief engineer for leather that he knows what to 
do everything, a scientist. T he other onethatknew them otors. T hat m an, oneof  them  went to 
Bedzin to seehis brother.  Never came back. They caught him ,henever cam e back.  He lef t his wif e 
and little child. 
 
 
About a week later, we got thef oodf rom theJewish com munity.  I heard there was no more 
Jews there, it was clean of  Jews.  I thought Im ight escape, because I came, went by a church, 
som ebody whistled.  Itwas a Jewish gu y.  He says com e with the bread.
  
I said no, the people won't 
have anything toeat.  T he next m orning,6:00, who com es in?  SSwith the truck. They took usall 

then.  But one, af riend of  m ine, an electrician that used to go with me, he musthave escaped 
through a window, butI never heard him  after the war.  I don't know i f hem ade it or not. 
 
 
T here was a lady, thewife of  theengineer with the littlebaby, who we saw.  I held thebaby 
going to the train,and when we arri ved, I gave back the baby, lucky m e.  Right away, the SS cam e 
fo
r her in the private car, tookaway the baby. If  I wouldholdthe baby, I would go with her,because I 
am her husband. T hey took them  to Auschwitz. W e didn't know atthe tim e whatAuschwitz m eant.  

W e were the ones cleaning outthe ghettos, because no more Jews were there.  Mountains of  shoes 
and leather, bedding to separate,this to separate.

But what actually happened was a Germ an off icer let know that they m eant to kill us. So the Russi
a n 
Arm y said gof irst, they came around, and they cam e toT heresienstadt,that's why we're s af e.T hey

suddenly, on thefourth day I hear som ebody calls m y nam e. My sis ter's husband heardon the radio

English.  He spoke French.  They had ahousekeeper, a French lady, spoke with them  only French 
and 
E n glis h
.  So they knew betterprobably than Polish. Spoke several languages.  Also Lithuanian, 
because he escapedf rom Lithuania right away.  
 

 
T hey took them  as spies.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Am ericans thought he was a spy because hisEnglish was so good? 
 

>> Morris Rosen: 
 
Right, because English was so good, they're spies.  You go, wef ind you.  Next 
day, I get
 
off the station in Pilsner.  I seeAmerican soldiers there.  I'm  cold, dirty, tired. They seef rom  
the ground bags covered. I keep the cover to m e.  Ifell asleep. I woke up, I'm the only one on the 
cem entf loor. 11:00.  Cold, what do Ido? Igo to the police there.I askfor the police.  Itell them  I'm  
Polish, I'm  hungry, I'm  from  the camp. They say don't say you're Polish.  T ell them  you area Jew 
f rom  Poland. They hated the Poles. 
 
 
W hy?  In 1938 whenthe Germ ans occupiedall partsf rom  Czecho
