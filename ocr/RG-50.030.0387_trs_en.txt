A: –eyes and when some body open up with a Schmeisser

 from a side, it hit me right in the 
top of the head, it practically scalped me. There was a big scar across, it was blood all 
over. And my friend got hit, apparently the same set of bullets hit him right here and took 
a top of his head. So I grabbed him and I ran with him for about 400 feet. And I could 

never lift him because he was a big boy, about his size Œ your size. 
 
Q: And you lifted him that day?  
 
A: I lifted him, I grabbed him, I had his gun Œ his rifle and my rifle and some other items, 
and him. I must have Œ I must have run about three or 400 feet before I ran into my own 
boys and we put him down and tried to get help and of course he was beyond help 
because his top of a head was gone. So I had my head fixed and then after war in 

Germany, I got a good German surgeon and he cut it open again and left only a little, tiny 
Œ I mean, it was a scar, I™m Œ it was enormous scar. So he left  only a little, tiny scar there. 
But I still Œ when I take my hat off, I kind of reme mber that blood running and the whole, 

horrible, open thing there, just like my top of a head was completely open down to the 
brains. But it wasn™t, the Œ 
 
Q: But it was also seeing him, too. 
 
A: It was, yes. So I keep my hat on, just about everywhere. I take it off in church and I Œ I 
take it off when I go to bed. I keep it at Œ on at work. Everybody is used to it or if they 

are not, they better be. 
 
Q: Right,right. 
 
A: There was Œ went to Miss Batchelor™s wedding. I had my hat on, and they had skullcaps. 
And I was going to have a special skullcap ma de for me  because I was the honorary 

grandfather–. Right, an, an English speaking person can™t.

Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It™s April 8, 1998. We ™re in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, or nearby. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and it™s 
tape one. And if we could just begin by having you introduce yourself and then also tell 
us where you were born and when. 
 
A: Very well. My name  is Stefan Czyzewski. I was born in 1922, in a little town of 
Lesnogóra, Poland. Lesnogóra is in central Poland, about 45 kilome ters east of Wa rsaw. 
It™s a small haml et, you cannot even find it on a map, but it™s still there. Last time I wrote 
to somebody there, it still was there.  
 
Q: Tell us what it looked like. What it was like to grow up there?  
 
A: To live there? 
 
Q: To Œ in, in Lesnogóra. 
 
A: Oh, it was a farm Œ a farming community. There was no industry of any kind, just farms. 
There was one little store, kind of a general store, one room little store, ran by a Jewish 
family. The rest of the people were all Polish peasants working on a farm.

Q: And what did your parents do?  Maybe tell us their name s and what did they do, were you 
farmers?  
 
A: Yes. My father was Jan Czyzewski, he was a farmer. My mother was Bogumila 
Czyzewski, nee Boruc. My mother was an Œ was a schoolteacher. And she was a 
frustrated schoolteacher. When she married and had a first child, which was me, she 
would not be hired to work any more. So she was really frustrated. By a time I was three, 

she taught me how to read and I never stopped. I fell in love with books and I have been 
reading ever since. 
 
01:06:05 
 
Q: What was your family home like?  Did you have land?  What did your Œ just tell us a little 
bit about that, what did your father farm?  
 
A: Yes, we Œ the farms in that part of Poland were a kind of a variety farm. The land was 
rather poor, so they planted just about everything that they needed and in Œ everything 

they could sell. They planted a lot of cabbage and a plenty of potatoes and some  wheat 
and also a lot of rye. Our land was in many little pieces, so we had to travel from a 

village to work on, on the land. My father Œ just about like me Œ spent a lot of time in 
strange places. The part of Poland that we lived in before 19 Œ in Œ before 1900™s, were 
occupied by Russia, Czarist Russia. My father was conscripted, or drew a lot and spent 

12 and a half years in Czar™s imperial army. He came back home for six months and the 
first war Œ world war started. He was calle
d again and did fight on the western front 
against Œ against Germans. And of course he heard some  Polish people speaking across 
the front lines, so he walked across one night and thought he would join them. Instead of 
that, they put him in a prisoners of war came Œ camp. And they sent him way, way out 
west, close to the western front line betw Œ a li Œ a front line between France and 

Germany. And again, well he was Œ at that time he was a sapper. He was a fortification 
specialist. So the Germans gave him a group of people, group of prisoners and they built 
fortifications Œ a kind of a front line fo
rtification system at Verdun. And probably 
everybody heard of that horrible battle at Verdun, where more than half a million people 
were killed. So he did, and the Germans of course, were very appreciative, so he put him 
in a fr Œ one morning they put him in a front of a squad that he was in and gave him 

German Ritterkreuz

 or, or EisernŠEisernekreuz

 Œ German, German decoration, 
because the part that he built there Œ the French could not overrun it. They tried several 
time, they couldn™t overrun it. Anyway, a few days later, he heard Polish people speaking 
across the line on the French side. So he walked across. And the Po Œ he joined Polish 

Legion that was fighting on the French side. Couple nights later he led the French into 
the part of the fortification that he built. They overran it, they kicked the Germans out

and the French gave him the Croix de Guerre
4
. So he had German decoration, he had 
French decoration. Later on, the Polish Legion gave him Virtuti Militari,
5
 Polish cross. 
So when my father came back home after the wars, he didn™t brag much about it. As a 
ma tter of fact, my family didn™t know about it. I was the only one that he showed the 
crosses to and he told little about what happened. When he came home, he brought some 

things. He brought a French army coat and 
he brought a pair of American army boots. 
And he had those boots until 1940™s. They were pair of clodhoppers. They had a big, 

round toes, but he said, ﬁThose are the best boots I ever had.ﬂ They were ugly, but he 

said, ﬁThey are sewed, they are glued and nailed. You can never wear them out.ﬂ 
Occasionally on Œ on a big holiday, he would put those boots on and paraŒ shine them 
and parade around it. And everybody was look and said, ﬁJan, where do you get those 

ugly boots? ﬂ He said, ﬁYou better shut up, thos
e are American boots, those are the best 
boots I ever had.ﬂ 
 
01:10:54 
 
Q: So your father, when you were growing 
up, would Œ would talk with you about his 
military experiences? 
 
A: He talked a blue streak to me , but he w
ould not talk to anybody else. And of course he 
talked about all the girlfriends he had. The 
great Russian girlfriend he had. And the great 
German girlfriend he had. And of course
, he had a great French girlfriend.  
 
Q: Tell us about your siblings. You™re Œ you™re not an only child. Who else was in the 
family? 
 
A: Yes, I had two sistŒ I had Œ have two sister, 
who are in their late 60™s or early 70™s. When 
I was arrested, they were a Œ 
 
Q: Their names, can you tell us?  
 
A: Yes, the older one is Henryka. She is about 71. The younger one is Œ or was Œ is Eleanor 
or Eleonora. She™s about 68 or 69. When I was arrested, they were like 12 and 14. And 
two years ago, they came to visit me. And I said, ﬁWell gee! I left two pretty little girls, 
what do I see now?  Two old, little woma n.ﬂ And my sister Eleonora is outspoken, she 

said, ﬁWho do you think you are?  You™re a old, little man.ﬂ 
 
Q: What was a regular day like?  Did you work w
ith your father?  Just describe a regular day 
at your home.

A: We did get up at the sun raise, or before. And we did little work, like taking care of the 
livestock, feeding the cows, feeding the pigs and watering the horses and preparing. And 
then of course Œ then after that I went to school. And first three years, we had a village 
school, was a one room village school. Later on I had to walk to the town of Grebków, 

which was our district, little village, which had seven grade school. So my time was spent 
mostly in school. I would walk at seven in morning to get to be Œ to be in school by eight 
and I didn™t come home until about three. So then I helped around the farm. And on 

weekend, on Saturday, I would work with father in a field, but on a weekday, I did not. 
 
Q: And what Œ what kinds of things did your family do in the community?  WhŒWere there 
political parties or any kind of small organizations in the village that they took part in?  
 
01:13:43 
 
A: There were political parties, but they were just practically two. There was the Nationalist 
party, which was very small and hardly anybody joined it because they were kind of 
chauvinistic and there was the so-called ﬁnon-partyﬂ party, which was the government 
party. And most people were kind of Œ not exactly joining it, but supporting it, because 

all the politicians and all the representatives were members of that party. There was quite 
a lively social life. There were mostly Œ mostly religious holidays and feasts that people 
took part in it. Like for instance, when the month of May came, every night after supper, 

everybody went to a little shrine and they would be singing lot of hymns and they would 
sing a litany to all the saints and then you would walk home and sing loudly. There was a 
fair, one or two or three religious fairs, that special preachers would come to the church 

and we would walk to church and listen to the preachers and there were booths and 
souvenirs toe Œ tables. And food tables, where you would spend little money to get some  
food that you norma lly did not eat at home. We ll, every Tuesday there was a 

ma rketplace, ma rket day. You would Œ father would hitch a horse and we™d take some  
butter and eggs and some grain and some potatoes and drive to Kaluszyn, where the 
ma rket took place and the people from a city would Œ housewife would come  and buy 

your butter and buy your eggs. And Kaluszyn was a town of about 12,000 people, of 
whom about 10,000 were Jewish people. Jewish people were me rchants, they were 
professional, they were attorneys, they were doctors. They were tailors and shoema kers. 

And we traded with them throughout our lives. We  always had a family or two or three 
that we™re very friendly with and visited when we went there. We would start their place 
and ma ybe get a cup of tea. When they came to see us, we would give them a dozen of 

eggs and when they came to visit on the farm. 
 
01:16:25 
 
Q: Well, how would you describe the relations in general between Jews and Poles at that 
time?  First maybe think about your village.

A: In our village, there was one Jewish family. It was actually fi rst a Jewish man, only, who 
opened a little Œ like a grocery and needles and thimble store. Later on he had a wife and 
two children. And relations were not strained. We kind of tolerated one another. All 
Polish Jewish people were Orthodox people. They wore special dress, they had 

sideburns, they had peyse
6
, the long side hair. They wore gabardine coats, they wore little 
hats, with a Œ little tiny, black hats with a tot Œ little tiny visor. And they spoke very 
broken Polish. 
 
Q: For instance, did the children go to the school that you went to?  
 
A: The Jewish children would go to public schools that all of us had to go. But, they would 
spend little time there, but most of the time they spent was in a cheder. There was a 

Jewish cheder, they went and they learned to Œ how to write Yiddish and some  of them 
would learn Hebrew. And socially we did not
 have much to do together. Socially, we 
kept completely apart. We did not mi x, or if they did, it was very little mi xing between 
the Jewish people and Polish people. 
 
Q: Did you understand why?  Wa s that ever sort of spoken, or was that just how things were?  
 
A: That™s was how the things were. It was not
 a Œ because one hated one another, but was 
simply because the things were. People gravitated to their own and they did little 

association business-wise and also occasionally visited. For instance, we had had a Œ a 
Jewish peddlers come . There was a Jewish lady, whose name  was Golda, who came  

carrying a big bag and she was trading. She brought sacharyna
7
 to sell, she brought 
needles, she brought thread, she brought little pieces of material. She brought 
occasionally a dress or two. And she would take in Œ in exchange, she would take eggs 
and butter and some potatoes and maybe some grain. 
 
01:19:20 
 
Q: Tell us a little bit more about your family and it™s religious beliefs. When you were 
growing up, how did your parents explain those to you?  Wi -Wi Œ you know, in church 
and that sort of thing. 
 
A: We  took the church for granted. We  just went to church on Sundays. We  went to 
religious instructions, which were taking place in public school. Once a week, a priest or 

a nun would come and take a Œ actually the priest or nun came every day, but took one 
class, for one hour we received our religious instruction. And we went to special 

preparation like for first communion or confirma tion. We  would go to church in groups 
that Œ which reached certain age and were prepared. We  prayed at home frequently, we 
would say a rosary. Probably not every day, but
 at least once a week. And we kids hated

it because we had to kneel for about 45 mi nutes on a hard floor, so we squirmed and we 
complained, but quietly, because father 
did not take any guff from any kid.  
 
Q: So it was a part of your home life and it was certainly a part of your parents beliefs?  
 
A: Very much so, yes.  
 
Q: Was there a time, as you started to get older, that it became more something that you 
believed in and it wasn™t that your parents were kind of asking you to do?  
 
A: No, it became Œ it was given Œ it was given. We  did not question. We  knew that if you 
went to college later on, if you went to unive rsity, you lost your faith, in parenthesis. You 
lost your faith, because you started questioni ng. And you started not really believing the 
stories. ﬁWell, those are just stories, you know, Bible is a story and religious stories is a 

story and life™s of saints, oh, just nice little stories. And the Christians and the lion s, of 
course, were also just stories. Maybe true, maybe not. So you don™t have to believe any 
more, huh? ﬂ But there were not ma ny people who went to college and there not ma ny of 

those who went there, who lost their faith. 
 
01:22:04 
 
Q: You say you were in school, were you thinki
ng about going to college, were your parents 
talking to you about that?  
 
A: Yes, they were talking about going not to college, but to go into mi ddle school, which 
back there, it was a gimnazjum,
8
 it was equivalent of American college. And I was one of 
the students who was halfway bright and I di
Œ giŒ did get grant. They call it stypendium.
9
 
I went to Œ for two years to the city of We grów, which was about 15, 18 miles, it was our 
county seat. I went to this Œ I call it gimnazjum, before the war came and ended it all. 
 
Q: So how old were you when you went?  
 
A: I started at Œ I was 15 and I ended when I was 17, when the war came, I was almost 17 
when the war came. 
 
Q: And was it obviously Œ how did your parents feel about you going?  
 
A: We ll, they wanted badly to go Œ to let me  go, but they could not afford it. The fees were 
steep. So I did get a so-called stypendium from
 the county. There were two kids from the 
county who passed the examination and I was the second one. The first one was a girl

who was bright and I hated her. Competed with her all Œ all my grade four, five and six 
and seven. And she just almost always beat me to it, except in the literature.  
 
Q: So, was it hard for your parents to let you go?  
 
A: Not really. They were so proud, they were so damn proud, I was ashame d  some time 
when they bragged about it. 
 
01:24:03 
 
Q: Tell us what they said, what would they say about you?  
 
A: ﬁWell, he™s bright. See, he can read. He c
ould read when he was four.ﬂ To take it back, 
when I was about eight or nine, my uncle Bronislaus got married. They lived in a big, 
ramshackle house. His wife brought a bunch of books. Those were thŒ those were the 
books I was not supposed to read. They™re called in the French Romances. Of course I 

did, I sneaked out and read them, I mean I just read them day and night. And of course I 
got caught. My mother said, ﬁAha. Those books you are not supposed to read, but I guess 
I won™t prevent you from reading it, so to counter with, every night after supper, after 

you eat supper, you are going to read the Bible, aloud.ﬂ ﬁBible?  What do I want to read 
the Bible for? ﬂ ﬁWell, you are going to read it if you want to or not.ﬂ So I did, for half an 
hour, then 45 mi nutes, then one hour. The neighbor™s kids were laughing, ﬁHoo, he is 

reading Bible.ﬂ Pretty soon the neighbors kids started comi ng in to listen, because the 
Old Testament stories are fascinating, bloody and murder at times. Especially if you 
come  to the Book of Judith, I mean that was a real story. So, after supper, there™d be a 

bunch of kids sitting, later on, in winter, I mean and we had no electricity, just a gaŒ a 
kerosene lamp there. Adult neighbors would be comi ng and listening to those stories of 
Old Testament, especially the Book of Judith when she Œ she went to sleep with him and 

got up in a mi ddle of a night, I mean the leader, the whole affair and this leader of the 
Philistines Œ got up in a mi ddle of a night, chopped off his head and took it with her. I 
mean, those were great stories. By the time I was 14, I read the Bible aloud twice. So I 

pretend to know some thing about Bible. 
 
Q: What Œ at that point, what were you thi
nking your future mi ght hold?  We re you think Œ 
did you have any idea of what you mi ght do?  
 
A: Well, it was a given that I was going to be a farmer. I would inherit most of my father™s 
farm, pay off my sisters. I had different ideas, I wanted to live in a city and get a job in a 
city, especially afŒ I, after I went for two years to gimnazjum, I was Œ I knew everything. 
But I didn™t Œ we didn™t talk much about it because my father was a choleryk.
10
 He had a 
short temper. If you said anything that he didn™t like, you got walloped.

Q: It sounds though like a very unified family. 
 
A: Very much so. Kind of, but not exactly on a defensive, but very close-knit family. 
 
01:27:03 
 
Q: Think back to ma ybe six months or a year before the war broke out. Did Œ do you 
remember a time when you noticed a shift in the tone?  That you began to be aware that 
some thing mi ght be happening, and how Œ how did you become  aware of a change Œ 
possible change in your life?  
 
A: We  were very much aware that the war was comi ng. I mean, we Œ we just Œ we just felt it 
in our bones. And the political shenanigans, negotiations and so on and so forth, we knew 
we were going to fight Germany. We  never expected to find the Soviets. We  had, of 
course, Non-aggression Pact with the So Œ pact  with the Soviets. We did not expect to 

fight them, but we knew we were going to fight
 the Germans. There™s a Polish joke, later 
on developed, you know, when times were the hardest, the most difficult, people were 

being killed, mutilated, arrested, sent to camps, gassed Œ the Poles made the best jokes. 

We made the best jokes ever. Scenario Œ the Germans come from the west, the Russians 
come  to Œ from the we Œ east, who do we shoot first?  Russians. Pleasure before duty. 
 
Q: On that note, let™s change tapes. 
 
01:28:32 
 
A: You have to have a Catholic Bible. 
 
Q: Okay. My mom does. 
 
A: Does she?  Okay, look in a Œ  
 
Q: Yeah, she™s Catholic. 
 
A: Œ the Book of Œ of Judith does not exist in a Patterson Bible. 
 
Q: Oh,okay. 
 
A: See, when the Bible was being translated Œ 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: Œ the group of Anglican scholars appointed
 by Hen Œ King Henry, looked at it and they 
say, ﬁthis, this, this and that and thatŒﬁ

Q: Right. 
 
A: Œ are not necessarily inspired, so we will leave them out. There™s Belgium and Reims, 
France, they translated the Bible, the so-called Douai-Reims translation and they said, 
ﬁWhatever was good for Saint Jerome is good for us.ﬂ So they translated the whole kit 
and caboodle.

Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We  are outside of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape two. 
Think Œ if you can think back to Œ you were saying that you knew that war was comi ng. 
To think back to Œ you know, place yourself and how did you know?  Did you hear things 

on the radio?  Were there conversations that you had or heard?  If you could tell us some 
of those. 
 
A: It was mostly news on the radio and also newspapers, also newspapers. We  kind of 
watched closely, all the political shenanigans. You know, our Ministers of Œ of Foreign 

Affairs was going back and forth, was going to France, was going to Germany, was going 
to England, negotiating and negotiating and Germans having more and more power and 

asking for more and more of Œ of Poland. We  knew that time was comi ng and of course 
we knew we™re going to beat the bejesus out of the Germans, turned out differently. 
 
Q: What did your father and mother say about it?  What was the feeling back home in 
Lesnogóra, you were in school nearby, what waŒ when you went home, what were 

people saying?  
 
A: It was a vacation time when those things went on, so I was at home. I was back in June 
and there was June, July and it started at the end of August or first of September. So we 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387  
12 
 
talked about a lot of it and father said, ﬁWell, we can beat them easily.ﬂ And he wanted to 
join Œ he wanted to join, but they wouldn™t take him. Said, ﬁYou old ma n, go back 
home.ﬂ 
 
Q: So, was there any fear? 
 
A: There was apprehension, but not real fear.We kind of felt that, ﬁWell, regardless how 
bad it is, it™s going to be on the Western border. There may be a stalemate, they may be 

going for some  time, but most likely they won™t come  here.ﬂ Of course, later on we, we 
learned better.  
 
02:03:14 
 
Q: How did you understand what Germany was doing?  I mean, how did you understand 
Hitler and Nazism? 
 
A: Well, first of all, we heard a lot of that perse-persecute-persecution in Germany. We had 
some  Jewish people who came and lived with our Jewish friends in Kaluszyn, who came 
from Germany and told a lot how they were being ﬁkicked around,ﬂ as Œ as they said. The 
Germans had dema nds Œ wanted to have the northern part of Poland, the Polish corridor 

that we had, going to the Baltic Sea. First they asked for fr ee passage back and forth 
between East Prussia and Germany. Later on, they asked for the corridor, they just 
wanted there Œ they wanted Gdynia, they wanted Danzig, they wanted the whole 

territory. And of course, Poland was not about to give it to them, so we knew that a war 
was on-comi ng. 
 
Q: When you say you heard about how the Jews were being treated in Germany and that you 
heard from people that had been kicked Œ kicked around, how did you ma ke sense of 

that?  Did you have any idea that this was a Œ a policy in Germany?  
 
A: Yes, we did. We  knew it was a policy of the German governme nt. We  knew Œ our press Œ 
Pola-Poland had quite a free press. I mean there were Socialist papers, there were 

extreme Rightist papers and the general press was kind of in between. So there was a lot 
about the persecution of mi norities in Germany. And also, we knew a lot about the 

hoodlums who came to rule Germany. And we kind of wondered, especially in school, 
when I was still in school, that winter and spring before the hostilities started. We talked 
a lot with professors and we were greatly impressed always by the German scholarship, 

by the German philosophy, by the German literature. And then we thought, how could 
that ever happen, that the Germans let themselves be led Œ those intelligent, those bright, 
those advanced Germans can be led by a group of hoodlums of that kind Œ of that sort.

Q: So think back to that summe r of 1939 and tell us where you are, what you™re doing every 
day and as we get closer to September, 1939, what™s going on?  Are Œ are you being 
recruited, are you talking with your friends about fighting, what™s going on?  
 
A: That summe r, we work on farm. I work Œ help my father on the farm, we Œ we it was Œ 
everything was almost planted when I came home from school in June, but the harvest 

came soon, first the hay. And the haying was done all by hand, even the mowing of the 
hay was done by hand. And the first day of haying Œ of mowing the hay, when you came 

home at night, you didn™t feel like eating, 
you could not sleep, your bone ached, every 
muscle your body ached. You were pulling the scythe, mowing the hay all day. Second 

day was better, the third day was nothing to it. Then the harvest came, of course and it 

was a hot, dry summe r. The harvest was quite good, so we harvested first the rye, then 
the wheat, then the potato picking did not come until September. By that time, the war 
was over, when we picked the potatoes, so it waŒ else, was just about ending. It was a 

summe r of apprehension, a summe r of some  fear Œ what is going to happen?  And of 
course, when the war started, things started happening. 
 
Q: What did you think was Œ was going to happen with you?  What were your plans?  
 
A: My plans were just about broken. I knew that I probably wouldn™t go to school any more. 
And I was very reluctant to stay and work on the farm. And when the war came and we Œ 

when we lost the war to Germans and the Soviets, I knew I was going to be stuck and 
work on a farm with my father, which Œ I was quite resigned to it. Said, ﬁWell, hopefully 

the war will end and maybe I wiŒ I can go back to school and perhaps live Œ even live in 
a city. But for now, I™m stuck here, so I better make the best of it.ﬂ 
 
02:08:53 
 
Q: Tell us where, where you were in those early days of September, in 1939 and when you 
first felt the presence of the invading army?  
 
A: It was Œ we knew that it was going to start soon, like in August. And we knew that 
Germany was going to attack soon. And then we heard the news about the Polish Œ a 

small group attacking Germany, in Silesia Œ it was a little town of Glewice, where a 
German dressed up a group of their own soldiers in Polish uniforms and attacked their 

radio station, took it over. And of coursethey had brought bodies from concentration 
camps, dead bodies and dressed them in Polish uniform Œ uniforms and had some  
casualties there. So we heard about that and of course, few days later, September first, 

they attacked.  
 
Q: I™m not sure I really understood what happened in that little town in Silesia? 
 
A: InGlewice?

Q: Yeah, in Gle-GleŒ 
 
A: Ah, it was a p Œ a put up affair by the Germans. They dressed up We hrmacht
11
 people in 
Polish uniforms and attacked their own radio station. It was the incident that created the 
war. They had the pretext, ﬁThe Polish Œ Poles attacked us and now we have to, of 
course, defend ourselves.ﬂ 
 
Q: How did you hear about it and how did you know exactly what had happened?  
 
A: It was on a Polish radio, it was in Œ was in Polish papers. Polish intelligence at that time 
apparently, was quite keen. And they knew all about it. 
 
Q: So where were you Œ where were you when you 
first heard about that and what were your 
thoughts?  
 
A: I was in my village, listening to a crystal radio and I thought, ﬁWell, it™s inevitable, the 
war is co Œ war is comi ng and we™ll have to fight.ﬂ I was too young to Œ to be 
conscripted. My father was too old. He, of c ourse, wanted to go and join. They said, ﬁGo 
Œ old ma n, go back home. You had yours.ﬂ 
 
02:11:20 
 
Q: And when Œ how quickly did you feel the presence of Germans in your town?  
 
A: Within about three weeks, they were, in our neighborhood, the Œ kind of a pincer 
moveme nt went around Wa rsaw. The Œ Wa rsaw was still fighting, but they went around 
and approached our neighborhood. There was quite a sharp firefight in my village. 
Started early morning Œ the Polish cavalry came in and some infantry came in. The 

cavalry dismounted and sent horses back and they dug in on the periphery of my village. 
They had a whole bunch of little, anti-tank artillery. Was two fat wheels, and a horse and 
they could pull it like the dickens. Two men could pull that little thing. It was very 

effective against German tanks. So they dug in and they were waiting, and of course, the 
Germans attacked. And it™s kind of strange, my father said, ﬁWell, why don™t you take 
the cows to the pasture? ﬂ And my father dug a dugout for the family, in a garden in the 

orchard, so they were Œ went all there and I took their horses and the cows to the pasture 
in the back Œ way back, beyond the village Œ it was a communal pasture. By the time I Œ I 
did get there, I couldn™t come back because there was a Œ I mean, was honest to goodness 

firefight. It was long distance artillery German Œ German artillery shooting. And a Œ a 
kind of bombarding the neighborhood, there was a Œ more machine guns going all over, 
so I just stayed behind the village, there, for about two hours. In about two hours, the 

Poles retreated and went and then came two cavalry me n, who said, ﬁHey, little boy, do 
you know that little wood across the hill, there? ﬂ ﬁOf course I know it.ﬂ ﬁWe have horses

there, about 15 horses, can you go and get the horses here? ﬂ  ﬁOh, sure. Why not? ﬂ  So I 
started  running, kind of over the hill Œ I run over the hill and there was lot of firing and 
going and then I see Œ all of a sudden, I was kind of running on the border of a hi Œ of a Œ 
of a field. The border was kind of a strip of gr
ass, it was higher than a field and I see right 
by my feet there, dust flying. And I didn™t think Œ think much of it, but it was some body 
shooting machine gun from a way, way distance there Œ German machine gun and hitting 
right where I was running, below my feet. It was several times, right below my feet. 

Apparently, whoever was shooting, was shooting little too low, thank goodness. When I 
ran to Œ I ran over the hill, the horses were gone.  
 
02:14:34 
 
So I laid down behind a bunch of trees, big Olszyna
12
 trees. There were such trees here. 
And artillery was shooting and hitting in Œ in transit was hitting a top of a trees and 

branches were falling down. So I just laid there for about half an hour, then it slowed 
down, I went back to the village, village was on fire and about two-thirds of the village 

was burned. There were nobody Œ no civilian casualties. There were about 35 Polish 
soldiers, who were killed. There were about 100 of Germans who were killed, back in 
approach the village. There were about 11 tanks that were mashed to smithereens by 

those little ca Œ Polish cannons. And of course the Poles ran away and the Germans came  
in. We were taking Œ getting water in pails, out of a Œ out of a well and I was Œ I climbed 
up on a top of a roof to prevent our house from being burned, because the neighbors 

house were burning, so I was handed the pails of water, I was pouring on the Œ on the 
roof of the house to prevent it from burning on. And the refugees who are running around 
the Wa rsaw, the bunch Œ were a group of people from Wa rsaw who were running around, 

ﬁWhat will happen to us, what will happen to us? The Germans are going to kill us.ﬂ 
Well, the German patrol came down the village and they just came, they didn™t bother 
anybody, went across the village and went into the woods beyond the village, where the 

Polish army escaped. And more patrols came and more patrols came. But they were very 
correct, they did not bother anybody. They questioned a few me n and they took 
document Œ asked for documents and they did not bother anybody. In Œ in other places, 

they would take young men and Œ and kill them. In our village, they were quite correct. 
 
Q: So, almost your first Œ well, your first interaction with this war. You were essentially 
involved in it. You got asked to come  into it. 
 
A: Well, kind of, but I was almost a bystander, but I was little foolhardy running over the 
top of a hill where the shooting is going on. Of course I can Œ I could run. I said, ﬁI can 
run Œ outrun anything. Nobody can hit me  Œ aim and hit.ﬂ And they didn™t.

Q: Did you tell your father this story?  
 
A: We ll, yeah, sure, of course I told him, I bragged about it. And he said, ﬁGood for you.ﬂ 
Because my father went with horses to the forefront, where the Polish soldiers were dug 
in, he was doing some  field work. And when th
ere started shooting, he just stayed with 
them. And he went to talk to them in a Œ in the Œ in foxholes, said, ﬁYou better go there. 

Get on this side, get on this side.ﬂ ﬁWhat do you know, old ma n? ﬂ ﬁWhat do you mean 
old man? I™m an old soldier. Right here get mutilated, get behind that bush. Dig Œ dig a 
little foxhole there.ﬂ So they did and sure enough, long distance artillery shell came right 

where they were and ma de a hole you can drive Œ ride horses in it. So they turn and said, 
ﬁWell, you old ma n, you Œ you knew what you were doing.ﬂ We ll, they retreated. So he 
went back with them and he wanted a rifle, but they said, ﬁWhy, we don™t give rifles to 

civilians.ﬂ So of course he came home and my sisters and my mother and some of the 
refugee from Wa rsaw wome n were in our dugout there. Of course, everything was 
burning. The pigs were burning and squealing and Œ it was kind of a bedlam. 
 
Q: That the animals were burning and dying?  
 
A: Yes. We  were lucky. Our house and our barn Œ animal barn Œ I mean cow barn and our 
grain barn were not burned, so. We  had a lot of people living with us for Œ after then. 
Some  were relatives who were burnt out, 
some  were neighbors who got burnt out. We  
had probably 35 people living with us. Wa s a three room part of a house. We  cooked a 
lot. We  rescued some  of the pigs that were burned and we lived high on the hog for 
several weeks.  
 
Q: What were those few weeks like right after that first firefight? Were, were the Germans a 
presence in the village? 
 
A: The Germans were not around at all. There was some  German police, that went and 
stayed with the Polish Blue Police in the Grebków by mi ddle, my school village where I 

went to grade fourth and up. And there were Germans in We grów , the county town. 
There was a Œ a small army detachment. And later on Œ later, later on, there were 

Germans Œ German cavalry standing in neighbŒ sitting Œ staying in neighboring village, 
but to my village, it came only for a visit. It was a time when they were apparently 
preparing for the eastern front, but of course I wasn™t there then. I was way out of it. 
 
02:20:29 
 
Q: We ll, what, what happened in those weeks that you Œ there were refugees living with 
you, what was going on around you and what were
 people talking about?  How were they 
preparing to cope with their situation?  
 
A: People were quite bewildered. They didn™t know exactly what was going to go on. The 
civil admi nistration was left intact, as it was. They had German supervisors, but on our 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387  
17 
 
                                                          
little district, there was not even a German supervisor. There was a count and there was a 
district secretary and couple helpers, couple t
ypists. There were a three man police force, 
which was staying there and they got orders from a Germans, but not really any orders to 
do anything unusual, just to keep peace. And of course, bunch of little boys Œ I joined the 

underground organization immediately. I think it was in early Œ late September or early 
October. We had a swearing in ceremony, one by one, in a cemetery. I can still remember 
it by heart. That was the Œ that was the O.P., Obroncy Polski,
13
 the Defenders of Poland. 
 
Q: Describe that and what Œ what Œ how did they swear you in?  What Œ 
 
A: We ll, you swore in that you are joining the defenders of Poland and, ﬁI™m going to obey 
all orders by the organization. I will not disclosed any secrets to the enemy, regardless of 
whatever happens and I will fight to the end for the freedom of my country.ﬂ That was 
about it. I still remember it in Polish. 
 
Q: Can you say it in Polish?  
 
A: Not really. And we did Œ not much, but we 
did get together once or twice a week and we 
talked and we collected arms and ammunition that was dropped by the Polish army, or by 
the Germans. We had a German light machine gun. We had a Polish light machine gun 
and we had a lot of rifles. I even found a six-shooter. It just Œ looked almost like a 

American six-shooter. Of course I gave it away to my commander later on, because he 
had to have a side-arms and I didn™t need to. 
 
Q: How ma ny people were in this group?  
 
A: There were 12 of us. Just a littŒ from two small villages, from Lesnogóra and Zarnówka. 
And of course, the swearing ceremony was very young and moving, you know, in a 

cemetery. 
 
02:23:32 
 
Q: Could you describe it?  Was, was it at night?  
 
A: It was in the evening, yes. 
 
Q: What, what was it like?  
 
A: We ll, the comma nder came from some where, I don™t know where, we™re not supposed to 
know. And he admi nistered the oath. You would swear upon your grandfather grave. And 

of course I wasn™t with it for too long, because I took a little side trip.

Q: So 12 young me n got together and decided that they would fight?  
 
A: Yes. Just a bunch of kids shooting off their mouth. I have glaucoma  on my eyes on

yourŒ 
 
A: Alldead. 
 
Q: Alldead. 
 
A: None alive. Mostly were killed. Most of them were dead by 1943. 
 
Q: So what did you do?  I mean, did you get into any Œ 
 
A: Well, see when I Œ when I took my little side trip, they were in their organization. They 
became an active, so-called active group. And they went on so-called wet works, 

attacking German patrols, German moving troops, German riding on a freeway toward 
the eastern fr ont. And they did get mutilated. They got shot and killed and apprehended 

and killed in prisons and Œ out of those, I don™t think anybody is still alive. 
 
Q: So, very quickly you formed a sort of a secret underground resistance group and then you 
awaited orders?  
 
A: We awaited orders. There were group in almost every small village. Every two villages 
they had a group. There was a overall comma nd. We  don™t know who they Œ we didn™t 
know who they were. They came for a visit, they announced, by runner they would come  
for a visit, we™ll talk to you and they came and talked and gave us instruction and send us 

trainers, who trained us for the things to come. But I took very little part in that, because I 
went on a trip east. 
 
02:26:39 
 
Q: Tell us about that. 
 
A: We had relatives and Œ who were in the Soviet zone, so-called, and it was Œ well I called 
the, the man uncle, but he was just a distant relative, he was not an uncle. We had some 

family things to do. I brought some  documents to him that he needed. And when I came, 
it was the night where they came. The Soviets NKWD
14
 came with lists and took 
everybody who was anybody in the Polish admi nistration, with their family. There was a

judgment night in a ma rketplace. There was a town of about 18-20,000 people. They took 
1,800 people. Men who were in admi nistration, who were teachers or preachers or 
policemen or anybody who were representatives to Polish legislation. And the judgment 
time took about four and a half hours. It was about like 37 seconds per person. There 

were three men. There was a man sitting behind a table with a long list, civilian, kind of 
weasely little person. There was a man sitting in a mi ddle and a big, Russian officer 
overcoat and a big hat, with a face, with a face Œ there™s a little Russian saying, ﬁMorda 

kirpicha prosit.
15
ﬂ ﬁA face that asks for a brick.ﬂ He had a face like that. On the right 
hand of his, sat another civilian with a list, writing sentences. The person on the left , the 
group of people, or a family, or a person w
ould came that he would look up his name  on 
the list and he would tell Œ the person in mi ddle that one looked up Œ and then he would 

said Œ would say, ﬁTwelve and a half, five a
nd five. Next. Fifteen, fi
ve and five. Next.ﬂ 
The one on the right would write a sentence. Twelve and a half or 15 or 20, me ans 12 and 

a half, 15 or 20 years of hard labor in a prison camp, in gulag, in most cases, in Siberia or 

Outer Mongolia or Kazakhstan. Five years of external exile, you could not come  back. 
Five more years of a loss of citizenship. ﬁNext.ﬂ Some people questioned it. I said, ﬁSir, 
but I haven™t done anything. Why? ﬂ He said, ﬁThis is Soviet justice, you don™t question 

it, you questioned it.ﬂ ﬁI haven™t done anything.ﬂ So, he said, ﬁWell take him out and

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It™s April 8, 1998, we™re outside of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. It™s conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number three. 
Just want to get you to say the name  of the town where this judgment was going on, that 
you were just describing. 
 
A: It was Szczuczyn. 
 
Q: Can you spell it?  
 
A: S-z-c-z-u-c-z-y-n. It was in eastern Poland and a little town. 
 
Q: And at that time controlled by the Soviets?  
 
A: Yes, it was on Œ in the Soviet zone. 
 
Q: And this is November, 1939?  
 
A: November, 1939. Anyway, when we came, I mean when they came to my uncle™s plaŒ I 
mean to my relative place, said, ﬁYou are ready in 15 mi nutes, take whatever you can 
carry. Your wife, your daughter, your son and who is this? ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I am a distant 
relative, I am just visiting here. So my suitcase is still unŒ not unpacked, so I will just 

go.ﬂ ﬁWhere do you think you are going? ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I go back to a German Œ into 
German zone where I belong, where my family is.ﬂ ﬁOh no, you are relative?  This is 
Soviet justice, you go with him.ﬂ ﬁNo, I™m not going. I™m going back home.ﬂ ﬁOh, you 

are not going, huh? ﬂ ﬁNo.ﬂ ﬁTake him out and shoot him.ﬂ ﬁI am going.ﬂ  
 
Q: They really said that? 
 
A: Yes. ﬁTake him out and shoot him.ﬂ ﬁI am going.ﬂ So my suitcase was packed and I Œ we 
went together. Anyway, his daughter, who wa
s almost seventŒ almost 16 and I was 17, 
we got light sentence, 12 and a half only. Tw elve and a half. And my uncle got 15, his 

son got 15, my aunt got 15 years. We  were Œ after the judgment we were loaded on the 

trains and we went and we went and we went
, for about five and a half weeks. We  went 
across the Soviet Union, we went across the Ur
al Mountains. We  went at far Œ as far as

the River Lena. It goes Œ I think it starts in a Balker Œ Bikal Sea
16
 and goes up into the 
North Sea. And then we went up the River Lena, some  in a train, some  in boats. We  got 
to within a short distance from the Arctic Circle. We™re put in a camp and we felled trees. 
 
03:03:17 
 
Q: Can I ask you what those trains were lik
e?  We re you standing, did they give you food?  
 
A: No, those were a Œ those were cattle trains that bunks were built. There was a pot-bellied 
stove that you could feed as much as you wanted to. And there were triple bunks and I 

don™t reme mber how ma ny people, about 50 people in each car. You know, like that 18 
me n and foŒ and Œ and six horses, or six horse
s. There were about 50 of us, I think about 
52. They kept the familŒ let the families be together. Yeah, we did get to the camp and 
we f Œ 
 
Q: Were you scared then?  
 
A: I™msorry? 
 
Q: We re you scared?  
 
A: Not really. We  stopped places, they gave us food some time, there were Russian people 
who were a Œ on little stations looking and talking to us. And if we Œ some  of us had 

some  money, they wanted Polish money or they wanted goods. They figured a piece of 
clothes, they could get some  good food. We  bantered, we laughed, we sang a lot. It was 

just accomplished fact, nothing to do Œ you can do about it. The guards were not very 
bad. If you wanted to run away Œ if you tried to run away, they shot you. That™s about all 
they could do. They did not mi streat us. We just went like on a nice vacation. Slightly 

apprehensive. 
 
Q: Where Œ what did you think was going to happen?  Where Œ did they tell you where you 
were going?  
 
A: We  didn™t know a thing. We  didn™t know a thing. They told us ﬁIdyosh na poselenie.

You are being exiled. ﬁNa poselenie.

Q: So tell us what it was like when you did get there. 
 
A: We put in a Œ in a barracks. Some people were put in a tent, I was lucŒ because there 
were not enough cabins. They were log cabins like barracks. But we kept building more 
of these log cabins. There were two, big pot-bullied Œ bellied Œ pot-bellied stoves that we 
fed as much wood as we wanted to. If you were close to it, you were sizzling. If you got 

little away from it, you are freezing. You know it™s a nice cool place there, huh?  Forty-
five below zero, is nothing to it. It used to get to 72 below zero. We  Œ it was 72 below 
zero and heavy wind, we did not have to go to work. So every night we would kneel 

down and say, ﬁGood Lord, let it be 72 below zero tomorrow and heavy winds, so we 
stay in.ﬂ We ll, if it was 71, nothing doing. If it was 72 and Œ and wind, you went anyway. 
 
Q: Did you have warm clothes?  
 
A: We had clothes that we came with and also they had the prison clothes, which is quilted 
kind of a gaberŒ I mean, kind of a poor material, like a Œ like a lining on a poor jacket, 

quilted, with a cotton in between. The down stuff is quite warm. And we had walonki,
19
 
which were felt boots, which were issued to some  of us. So you could survive. You could 

survive. 
 
Q: So what did you think when you got there?  I mean, what did you think was Œ was going 
to happen?  
 
A: We thought that we will try to survive. Since they are not taking it Œ us out and shooting 
us offhand, as they frequently used to do, that we knew of. The damn Communists used 

to do that to people frequently. We  thought that we would try to survive. 
 
03:08:05 
 
Q: So what Œ what was a re Œ describe a regular day. 
 
A: Wa ked up in suŒ before sunrise, counting Œ Appell
20
, counting. You got a pot of tea, 
which was ma de out of birch leaves. You got a little, tiny piece of bread, ma ybe half an 

ounce or so. You ate it. Then you dressed up and you went walking. If you reme mber, 
about four or five years ago, where there was a Olympics in Sarajevo, they showed the 

Russian Siberian man, who was a weightlifter and a wrestler, how he ran a mile in the 
snow that deep?  This is the snow we walked in. It was two guards and about 50 of us and 
we walked. And the person who walked ahead was changed every hundred feet or so. If, 

for Œ some time for punishme nt, if they ma de one person walk all way, a mile or two or

three miles to the place of work. He Œ by the time he got there, he was dead Œ breaking 
the snow. So we went Œ we cut trees for about five hours, then came soup at noon. People 
came with sleds from a camp, with big kettles of fish and cabbage soup. It was mostly 
water. We sat down and ate the soup, then we cut tree Œ trees again and stacked them and 

came back. Six p.m., we started on the way home, we got there by seven or so. We re 
counted again, got another pot of tea and a little slice of bread and of course to sleep. We 
had a good guard. I mean he was a damn Soviet, but he was a good guy, the guard. I 

mean, he was just out of this world. When we did get there, said, ﬁTea. Make fire.ﬂ So we 
ma de fire. ﬁMake big fire. Sit and rest.ﬂ So we sat around and rest. And he looked at his 
watch, he had a Polish watch that he stole during 1939 campaign, said ﬁpolsky chasy.
21
ﬂ 
Polish watch runs well. ﬁGo and cut.ﬂ So we went and cut for about, oh probably one 
hour. So then, ﬁHey, come  on back.ﬂ So we came back. ﬁSit and rest. Soup comi ng.ﬂ Oh, 
in about one hour, soup came. ﬁEat.ﬂ We  ate. ﬁSit and rest.ﬂ We  sat and rest. ﬁGo and 

cut.ﬂ So went and cut for about one hour. And he Œ then he went Œ came to us there 
where we were. ﬁNow, go and steal.ﬂ So we 
went stealing. A prisoner had to cut a cubic 
yard of wood a day. And regardless how young, how strong, how big you were, you 

could never do it. If you didn™t cut a square yard per person, your group didn™t, at night 
your soup was cut, your bread was cut accordingly. Next day you were weaker. In a week 
you were gone. So we would go and steal the wood that we cut day before and day before 

and day before stack it up, he would measure it. ﬁOkay, now we sit down and rest, we go 
home soon. Make bigger fire.ﬂ So we went home. That Ivan Ivanovich was a damn good 
ma n.  
 
03:11:47 
 
Also, I was lucky. I spoke some  English, I spoke some  German. I spoke Russian quite 

well. When my father and mother wanted us kid not to know what was going on, they 
spoke Russian. My mother was a Russian teacher in mi ddle school before she got 
ma rried. My father was of course, Russian speaking person. So we kids learned it in a 

hurry. We  knew exactly what was going on. On the train for six weeks, by the time we 
got to Siberia, my Russian was almost as good as my English. Much more colorful 
because I knew a lot of swear words. So they found out and I was called to the 

comma nders office and he said, ﬁYou stay here, you translate.ﬂ And he got the German 
word, ﬁYou dolme tscher.
22
ﬂ ﬁYou interpreter.ﬂ I don™t know how he got that German 
word, I knew what it was, but ﬁYou dolme tscher.ﬂ When new prisoners came, I would 

get up on that barrel and I would shout, ﬁHis Excellency, Commander so and so says this 
and says that and says that. You don™t do this, you don™t do that. You get shot for this, 

you get in solitary for that. You get hunged up for this. So reme mber.ﬂ And of course, 
after a few days, I Œ one time a group of Czechs came and I got up on the barrel and I 
became kind of Œ took it for granted, became rambunctious Œ young, stupid kid. And I 

said, ﬁCommander Mika-Mikhail Ivishenerovich, that son of a dog says this and this and

this.ﬂ And in Polish it™s skurwysyn,
23
 in Russian, it™s sukin-syn.
24
 In English, of course, 
you know what it is. So he came and he knocked me  down and he kicked me . Said, ﬁYou 
little so and so, you called me sukin-syn.ﬂ Said, ﬁI called you Excellency, and Excellency 
in Polish Œ in Czech, and sukin-syn sounds almost close together. I call you Excellency.ﬂ 

ﬁOh no, I know Polish and I know Czech, you call me  sukin-syn. If you say that again, 
I™ll shoot you, you little so and so.ﬂ Said, ﬁCommander, I did not say it, but I will not saŒ 
ever say it again if I did.ﬂ I thought my goose was cooked, but it wasn™t. So I stayed in 

barrack, I peeled potatoes, I swept the barracks. I had a norm man, a man who wrote the 
norms for the people, what people did during the day. I helped him do the norms. The 
classification, how much soup at night ever
ybody gets. And I learn how to cheat, how to 
write up Œ how to cheat so that people ma de more than they did. Anyway, I ma de it. 
 
03:15:12 
 
Q: You were with your family still, right?  
 
A: I was with Œ I was with my family still. About 11 months later, when Hitler attacked the 
Soviets, Polish undŒ governme nt in exile in London, negotiated with Stalin and those of 
us who received less than 50 years were Œ 15 years, were released. So my little cousin 
girl and I were released. It did not make any difference to my uncle, because he was 

dead. My aunt was dead. Their son Œ who was as big as this young ma n, and strong and 
sportsman, he was dead. Two little weasel-y thing, that little girl and I were still alive. 
 
Q: How did they die?  Did they die in Œ in the work camp?  
 
A: Died hard Œ hard work. Mistreatme nt, b eating occasionally. Some guards were vicious. 
Some guards were not as good as Ivan Ivanovich. I still say a prayer for him 

occasionally. 
 
Q: Forhim?  
 
A: For him. We  did get out. We  were allowed to go to southern part of Russia, where Poles 
are being collected and Polish army, to fight with the Soviets against the Germans, was 

formed. Some  of us crossed into Iran. The Soviets had a hard time taking care of all of us. 
Iran was run by the Russians and the British. We did sneak into the British part. The 

British trained us, arme d us, fed us Œ formed Polish second corps under Polish General 
Anders.
25
 They went to fight in North Africa. In
 Egypt, North Africa, all way to Tripoli. 
Later on they went fighting in Italy, all way to Monte Cassino. 
 
Q: At this point were you still with your cousin?

A: My cousin Œ wome n and Œ and children were bundled up and sent to India and South 
Africa. They build camps for them to stay for duration. After the war, they were all sent 
back to Europe. 
 
03:17:42 
 
Q: How was your strength after 11 months?  Your strength?  
 
A: Mine was all right. I had enough to eat. I had a sideline. After about seven weeks there, I 
was allowed to go out. There was a little settlement, winter settlement. They werŒ they 

were the Samoyed people. Siberian people like American Eskimos. Samoyed people 
raised reindeer and fished. So I went and wandered around and a young boy came and 

talked to me , he said, ﬁWho you are? ﬂ ﬁKto vy takoy?
26
ﬂ So I said, ﬁWell, I am Polish.ﬂ 
And, ﬁChto eto takoy?
27
ﬂ ﬁWhat is that? ﬂ Said, ﬁWell, I am from a country way, way 
west. Just like your Samoyed country, the damn Soviets took us over, they took you over 
and beat the bejesus out of us and sent us here to work in a camp.ﬂ ﬁUh-huh. You 
hungry? ﬂ ﬁOf course I™m hungry.ﬂ ﬁCome and eat.ﬂ And Samoyed build, build Œ live-in 

yurtas. Yurta is a kind of a conical tent ma de of bearskins, double bearskin Œ four out and 
four in. And it™s kind of a good size, about the size of this living room here, about 12, 15 
feet in diameter. But if you get into the yurta, if you Œ they use a Œ long handed hatchets, 

like American Indian tomahawks. If you pick up the hatchet and put it like this and take 
your hand off, the hatchet will stay there, the air is so thick. The Samoyed had people 
wash twice a year, if they have to or not. And they cook, they sleep, they ma ke babies, 

they do everything in the yurta. I mean the smell is overpowering. But they say, ﬁNever 
mi nd, pribyknyesh
28
 Œ you get used to it.ﬂ So I ate a lot of fish and the young ma n said, 
ﬁYou come  tomorrow? ﬂ ﬁIf I can, I come  tomorrow.ﬂ So he gave me  some  fish, I took the 

fish to the camp. I shared some  with the guards, I shared some  with fellow prisoners.  
 
03:20:16 
 
 Next day I couldn™t go, so third day I went and, ﬁWhat is your name? ﬂ ﬁStefan.ﬂ ﬁWe call 
you Stepka. Khorosho, kak Vas velichat™?
29
ﬂ ﬁHow do we call you? ﬂ Velichat™
30
, it 
means, you use you name , your father™s name . So I said my father was Jana. ﬁOkay, 

Stepka Ivanovich, come  on and eat.ﬂ So we ate. ﬁYiŒ How much time do you have? ﬂ  
ﬁOh, some  time.ﬂ ﬁWe™ll go fishing.ﬂ So we went fishing. So they gave me  Œ gave me  

harpoon and we walked, on the River Lena. And I fell in. I didn™t know what was what. 
River Lena is a very brisk river. The ice that time was probably 20 feet thick, but there

were wash-outs, little bubbles. If you step on the bubble, you go in. I was lucky, I had the 
harpoon. So I fell only in Œ that way I got wet. It was not very cold, just about maybe 25 
below zero. So two of them grabbed me  and ran back Œ ran to the Œ back to the yurta 
where I s Œ I stripped. And he said, ﬁWell, I loan you my suit.ﬂ His suit was made of 

silver foxes. Big pants up to here and a big parka, with a big, huge hood Œ silver fox 
outfit, and reindeer. It was soft as silk. Because this man had three suits and he had three 
wives. Good Siberian wome n can ma ke only one suit at a time. She has to chew the skin. 

Siberian wives has teeth just about three millimeters long, where they constantly chew 
the skin. You Œ you tan it and then you invert it and you chew the inside of it to make it 
soft, and becomes Œ either the chewing process or the saliva makes it as soft as silk. So I 

wore his suit. We nt fishing again, we caught some  sturgeon. They made a hole in a 
bubble, we got some  sturgeon, we came back. We  cooked some  fish, we ate some  fish. 
My suit was still wet so he said, ﬁYou wear my suit.ﬂ So I went. I was the best dressed 

prisoner in the whole damn Soviet system. I came, everybody™s oh-ing and oo-ing and 
the guards and especially the chachainsis.
31
 There were bunch of chachainsis. 
Chachainsis is a bunch Œ a bunch of son of a guns. They are cutthroats, they are thieves, 

they are murderers, everything. They kept looking. ﬁOh, too bad he is so small. Oh, too 
bad he is so small. We  would take it off you.ﬂ ﬁYou wouldn™t take it off me .ﬂ ﬁI 

wouldn™t? ﬂ I said that, ﬁWhat would you do to me ? ﬂ  ﬁCut your head off, you stupid so 
and so.ﬂ ﬁYou little so and so, you would cut my head off?  We  cut your head off.ﬂ They 
frequently would Œ if some body waŒ had some thing they didn™tŒ didn™t want to give, 

they would come  and cut his head off at ni ght and took whatever they wanted. Anyway, 
they became my friends and protectors. I don™t know why. I was just like a, like a little 
toŒ a flea, in comparison with them. 
 
03:23:50 
 
Q: Did you get to keep the suit?  
 
A: Of co Œ oh I kept it for duration. Later on, that ma n said Œ well he was a chief™s son, he 
had three suits and three wives and 700 reindeer. So he said, ﬁWell, I got enough, two 
suits, you can Œ Stepka, you™re my brother, you wear my suit.ﬂ So I wore his suit for the 
duration. And when I Œ I was ready to leave, I went to visit him and he said, ﬁWell, 

you™re going to stay with us Œ I mean all the time, stay with us. You can marry one my 
sister, you can ma rry two my sisters. You can ma rry three  of my sisters if you want to. 
You my brother, you stay with us.ﬂ So when I went to say goodbye, I brought his suit 

back. I said, ﬁI™m sorry, I have to leave. I want to go and fight for my country.ﬂ So we 
had a good cry and I went away. 
 
Q: What was his name ?  
 
A: Wa sŒ

Q: Hisname ?  
 
A: Krugly.
32
 That means the round one, Krugly. I could not pronounce his Samoyed name , 
but he was Krugly, the round one. He was a tough, young Samoyed, with three wives. He 
didn™t have any children yet. 
 
Q: So you knew when you left that you would pr
obably go back to your country and try to 
fight?  
 
A: I hoped so, I hoped so. Well, we™re told by the political officer, by the po
litruk
33
 in a

Army Œ are going to fight the damn Germans.ﬂ

[Technical conversation] 
 
04:02:54 
 
Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We  are outside of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape 
number four. If we could start with the last 
day or two before you left the Soviet work 
camp, how did you find out you were leaving?  How did you leave?  Where did you go?  
 
Q: It took about say a we Œ about a week befo
re we could leave. We  were Œ there was an 
announcement, you know, in a square, very official Œ lot of high rank officers came and 

said, ﬁWe did not want to hurt you Œ you Œ we  knew that you are our friends and now Œ 
from now on we will be allies and you are going to fight the Œ fight the German 

aggressor, so and so and so. And those of you who are not really criminals, traitors and 
all Œ all of us were trŒ tried under clause of high treason, paragraph 150. Even I was 
under high treason Œ 150, 150 sub-paragraph Œ subparagraph 12, subparagraph 17 Œ high 

treason. What for?  Anyway, it took us about a week before they went Œ we went down 
the Lena river. We  were up the riŒ Lena river. And then we got on the train and we got 
collected Œ assembled on Œ close to Iranian border. And there was such a multitude of us, 

they couldn™t take care of us. So they said, ﬁIf you want to volunteer and go across there, 
we have our people there, too.ﬂ So we sneaked Œ we went across and then we sneaked 
into the British part. And of course, British were forming Polish army and everybody 

who was anybody wanted to join it. Instead of joining those damn Communists. 
 
Q: Did you say goodbye to your cousin?  Did you realize you mi ght not see her for awhile?  
 
A: Yes, we said goodbye and she was whisked away. In about Œ after we moved to the 
British zone there, we were together for about a week. And we Œ they collected all 
wome n and children and she went to India. Some  went to South Africa, but she stayed in 
India for the duration of the war. 
 
Q: And when you say Œ tell us a little bit more about sneaking into the British side. Who did 
you do it with, was it a Œ a night that you did it?  And how did you do it?  
 
A: We ll, we just Œ actually, we just walked. And the Soviets stopped some  groups. Some  
groups were not even bothered with. Especially groups that had women and children and 
they didn™t want to bother with. We  just walked and hoped for the best. 
 
04:05:50 
 
Q: So if you Œ if you could just describe it for us. Where did you walk to and Œ and when Œ I 
mean, where did you spend the night, how did you find the British officials?

A: Yeah, it was close to Œ it were close to Teheran, it was west of Teheran. It was kind of a 
desert area and there was some local people who traveled with herds of sheep and such, 
from place to place, so we would stay overnight with them. We  just sleep outside, it was 
Œ you know, subtropics, it was warm and the Œ the British built camps already, so we 

went to the camp that was built for the refugees, by the British. And of course, pretty 
soon they started asking young me n to come  to lectures and come  to training and, ﬁDo 
you want to fight? ﬂ  ﬁOf course, what do you think?  I™m going Œ I came here for it.ﬂ And 

many people joined. And then I don™t know if I want to divert. I think I will have to 
divert back, before I Œ I left Siberia. Aboutsix months after we be Œ were there, they 
fished out 17 young boys, between 16 and 19. And I was one of them and we went 

through a heavy indoctrination course. Eight, 10, 12 weeks, eight hours a day. Heavy 
indoctrination course. And if you Œ if I get the three of you in a secluded place, that you 
are not allowed to leave, in about two weeks, you™ll believe any Œ everything that I will 

tell you. They Œ there™s nothing better than Communism. Dialectical materialism is the 
only doctrine that works among peoples. Soviet Russia is the most powerful, most wise, 
most Œ the best of all, the richest. We have the riches in Siberia that you never heard of. 

We  have enormous Ukrainian plains that we 
can Œ if we Œ planting our grain, we can s Œ 
we can feed the whole world. This is the best. You had to listen closely, you have to 

listen attentively. If you smirked, if you ma de a face, if you ma ke a funny rema rk, you 

were thrown Œ your shoes were taken, your jacket was taken, you were thrown into 
solitary, which was six Œ what Œ four by four 
feet. Your shoes were taken, too, overnight. 
You had to dance, jump, run all night. If you sat down, you never waked up. We ll, I was 
lucky, I spent only three nights. I couldn™t keep my tongue. I mean I couldn™t keep my 
mouth shut. I had to make remarks. I made faces, I laughed in his face, the politruk was a 
big ma n, had a face that was asking for a brick, too. I just smŒ laughed in his face. And I 

told him once, ﬁHow little you know.ﬂ So he was lenient with me, but still he, still he 
throw me in, in the solitary, one night at a time. If you spent two nights, you didn™t make 
it. Some  people Œ there were a few people who ma de it for two nights. Three nights 

nobody ma de, in a row.  
 
04:09:33 
 
Anyway, by the time we graduated, we had a talk, 45 mi nute talk. And if you mi ssed two 

words, you were thrown into solitary, had to repeat it. You had to give a lecture that told 
everything about the dialect Œ dialectical materialism. You knew all about Engels
34
, you 
knew all about Marx.
35
 You knew everything about Lenin.
36
 And you most about 
Stalin.
37
 I mean those were the holy Œ not a trinity, but a quadruplinity. And you had to 
talk about them in glowing terms. Your tone of your voice had to be just like a great

sermon on a mount. And you know, by the Œ by the end of it, I believed, strongly. I 
became a honest to goodness believer. So when we were later let go and I think it was 
somewhat with premeditation that this little group was let go into the British part. 
Because we going to be the avant-garde of Communism. We  are going to get introduced 

into armed forces or whatever groups there were and we™re going to propagate it by 
going Œ we are going to be the true believers. And there Œ for some  way or another, the 
British knew it. They collected us again. We went through a heavy indoctrination by the 

Polish political officers, by the British, who some  spoke Polish, some  worked with the 
translators. In about three weeks we lost the faith. We lost the true faith. And then they 
formed the arme d forces. Yes, let™s say they went to fight, they fought, fought all way to 

Monte Cassino. By Monte Cassino Œ when they took Monte Cassino, the second Polish 
corps Œ after British and the Australians and the Americans couldn™t take it, they were so 
bloodied, they were sent  to recuperationŒ 
 
04:11:40 
 
Q: Remi nd me  where we are at this point. I know where we are, but I mean, what year is it?  
You™re now Œ it™sŒ 
 
A: It was 1941. 1941 summe rŒ 
 
Q: And you™re outside of Teheran?  
 
A: Out of Teheran, last Œ late summe r. 
 
Q: And you™re getting Œ you™re getting training fr om British and fr om Polish? 
 
A: –and from Polish, we™re getting training. So my 17 were re-indoctrinated, re-
brainwashed and trained in sabotage and demolition. The whole 17. They were bright kiŒ 
I mean, of course we were bright kids. We  got to brag about it a lot, I mean we used to 
brag a lot about it. ﬁWe are the best of the best.ﬂ Were trained in sabotage and demolition 

and the underground work. We  were put in small groups. We  went back to Poland. 
 
Q: Before we go back to Poland, I want to know a little bit more about what the training was 
like. Take us through a day of training.  
 
A: The training was in the morning, was calisthenics. There was a five mile run. There were 
four hours of lectures, in Œ mostly about sm
all arms training and the firefights. Mostly 
firefights, being surrounded Œ being surr
ounded by a superior group and getting out. 
Constantly, constantly, constantly. 
 
04:13:10 
 
Q: You mean how to escape when you™re surrounded?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387

A: How, how to fight your way out. How to
 fight your way out. Then in afternoon was 
another lecture, which was a political lecture,
 whom we have to fi ght. Then of course, 
kind of a Œ the lecture would, would tell about
 how we do fight the Germans. ﬁBut, if you 
want to, you can fight the damn Russians, 
too.ﬂ And by nightfall, you fell sleepy, you fell 
off your feet, you slept. And the same  and the same . And then sabotage, blowing up 
bridges, blowing up trains, blowing up build
ings. Demolishing rail Œ train tracks, if you 
did not have explosives. And a lot Œ a lot of training with semi  and automatic weapons. It 
was a time when the British introduced a sten gun and we trained a lot with the sten guns. 
We trained little with regular rifles, but they said, ﬁWhen you get there, we will provide 
you with sten guns, you will have a lot of firepower.ﬂ And a sten gun is similar to 

American Thompson submachine gun. But it™s a piece of junk, actually. You shoot about 
1700 rounds and you throw it away, because after 1700 rounds, become s more dangerous 
to you than to your posŒ opponent. Anyway, seven of us went on a trip. We  walked, we 

rode trains, we hitched up rides on the tracks. We rode donkeys most of the time. We 
went through the western Iran, into northern Iraq. We  went through the Kurdistan. By the 
way, the Kurdish people are the greatest people ever. They can cut your head off, if you 

have Œ if you have some thing they like, but if you come  in, it is so much like in Œ in 
Poland, ﬁGuest in, God in.ﬂ They treat you like you were a god visit-visiting them. They 
give you food. They give you Œ what they have, they share with you. If you are ragged, 

they will give you shirt or pair of pants. But don™t look at anything good they have, 
because they will give it to you. If you look at some thing, ﬁOh gee, this is so neat.ﬂ They 
will let you sleep with his Œ with his wife if you like her. But you get out of a tent, they 

will follow you, cut your head off and take the stuff back. So we™re told, ﬁBe careful with 
the Kurds.ﬂ  
 
04:16:00 
 
Anyway, we walked through part of Turkey, we diverted into Syria and backed in 
Anatolia, Turkey, Anatolia. We  did come  to Bosporus Straits and we were kind of 
pursued at that time, we knew some thing 
was happening. We  were being hunted. So we 
me t a old fisherma n on the Bosporus and he spoke Russian. He was an old Turk who 
spoke Russian. And said, ﬁGrandpa, please take 
us across.ﬂ And he said, ﬁLords, night is 
falling, there™s going to be storm tonight, we  cannot get a Œ go across.ﬂ ﬁGrandpa, please 
take us across, because we Œ if we don™t leave here tonight, we ma y not be alive 

tomorrow. We  know some thing is happening.ﬂ The German had a Intelligence peŒ 
Intelligence people in Turkey and they organized pursuit parties, we overheard before 
then. So he said, ﬁWell, Lords, I™m old, my boat is leaky and if you want to risk, what am 

I to say? ﬂ So we said, ﬁGrandpa, we™ll pay you.ﬂ ﬁI don™t want to be paid.ﬂ So we said, 
ﬁGrandpa, we™ll give you the donkeys.ﬂ ﬁDonkeys, they™re not worth anything. They are 
worn up completely.ﬂ Said, ﬁGrandpa, you give them on a p Œ good grass, they™ll be as 

good as new in two or three weeks. Leave them here.ﬂ We  got in the boat, he gave each a 
Œ each one of us a piece of rope. ﬁTie yourself tiŒ s Œ well.ﬂ Storm came. It was the 
scariest five hours I lived in my life Œ scariest. I was in dark places, but this was the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387

worst. I think I fell out about four times. If it wasn™t for rope, I wouldn™t be talking to you 
tonight. The Mediterranean fish would have eaten me  up. Anyway, we did get to the 
Turkish side on the north side of Œ it was almost morning. Beautiful, quiet, sun was 
comi ng up. And the old Ismael said, ﬁLords, the Allah was with you. I don™t want to be 

paid.ﬂ But before we left, the British gave us some  gold pieces. ﬁCase you™re in a tight 
spot, trading, whatever.ﬂ So we said, ﬁGra
ndpa, we don™t want to pay you, we just want 
to give you baksheesh, a gift from the heart.ﬂ And each one of us gave him a gold piece. 
He looked, said, ﬁOh my Allah. My granddaughter will get ma rried, my younger 
daughter will get married, my grandson get married, I can pay dowry to every one of 
them and I™m going to live high on the hog for the rest of my days.ﬂ He got in his boat 

and a little breeze came, he just zoomed out of there.  
 
04:19:05 
 
And we walked across a part of Turkey, went into Bulgaria, we caught rides on trains Œ 

tracks, we head into Roma nia. We  sneaked into Nazi occupied Poland. You know, the 
front liŒ eastern front was way, way out. By that time, on Polish territory, the Germans 
developed Einsatzgruppen,
38
 special forces. They call them Einsatzgruppen or 
Vernichtungsgruppen,
39
 the exterminators. So they were killing lot of Jewish people and 
they were killing all the Jewish people they could find. And they were killing a lot of 
Polish people. So the Polish underground suffered for a time. But then, when we came, 
they provided us with arms and ammunition and some  unstable Polish dynamite. And we 

Œ each one of us Œ I was given 17 people. Seve
nteen plus two, plus Œ plus me . That were 
20 people. And we became the exterminators of exterminators. We would create false 

alarms. Because when something happen in certain village or little town, they would just 

swoop upon it. They Œ those groups were about 100, 75 to 125 in each group. They 
would swoop around, swoop in, surround it, burn it down, kill everybody. That was their 
standard procedure. And when they went to a ghetto, they would just kill all the Jewish 

people in the ghetto. Of course, ghettos were already fenced in Œ barbed wired in. So we 
did few things with them and we blew up Œ we could not blow up Œ blow up complete 
bridge, but we blew up parts of a bridge. We  
demolished a lot of railroad tracks. We blew 
up some  trains when we had explosives. And I was Œ oh, my gosh, my comma nder was a 
Œ I still don™t know his name . His name  was, was ﬁB. Dabﬂ Œ ﬁB. the Old Oak.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁYou little shit, I™m going to shoot you, I™m going to court martial you, you mi ssed it.ﬂ I 

would sit in a field with the two wires and a battery, holding here and I would touch it 
and the damn thing would not explode and the train would go by. Or some time I would 
blow it up before the train came. So after each incident Œ mi shap like this, he would gave 

me a dressing and threaten me with, with an execution and court martial and God knows 
what. He was a big, fat ma n with a very sharp temper.

And we slept in bunks. We  slept on farms that were far away from habitations. We  had 
dugouts in half a dozen different forests. Run around constantly. We  did get surrounded a 
lot of times. We  had to fight Œ were in lot of firefights with those groups. We re 
surrounded frequently by them and had to fight our way out. And about Œ in 1943, it was 

‚42, fall and winter when we started. Forty-three, in late spring, we hijacked German 
army bank on a street of Wa rsaw. We  lost three people out of about 25 or 30 that were Œ 
but we got a lot of money. We  got about 15 million ma rks. Each one was Œ one of us was 

given a bonus, and you were given operating e xpenses. I think we Œ my group got about 
half a million ma rks. And I had a drinking buddy, who was a young, German soldier, 
supply officer. So we had drinks, we me t few times. I introduced him to some  Polish 

girls. And we talked and he sold me about over 100 Schmeissers. Schmeisser is a light, 
automa tic weapon, similar to American Thompson submachine gun, but much, much 
more effective. Much more effective. And I don™t know how ma ny, probably about 12, 

15 million rounds of ammunition. So from then on, my little group of 17 plus three were 
carrying 27 Schmeissers, because some of the boys said, ﬁI don™t trust that damn German 
weapon, I want to carry two.ﬂ So I said, ﬁWell, you know, we have a Œ we join Œ we 

shared those with some  other groups, but we have plenty of it in places, hidden places. If 
you want to carry 17 extra pounds, what am I to say?  Go ahead, be my guest.ﬂ The 
German groups Œ ordinarily each squad had one Schmeisser and the rest of them had  

ma nual Mauser rifles. So when we Œ from then on, we Œ on purpose, did Œ when it catoŒ 
came to firefight, let ourselves be surrounded. And then when we opened up, we went 
just like a hot knife through a piece of butter. They had to keep their heads down, or they 

lost them. And anybody who stuck their head up did not get up again. So we went out 
and went out and went out and Œ course we we
re losing people. At the start we lost like 
11 people in two months. So the boys who were in my group said, ﬁWhat do we do? ﬂ I 
said, ﬁWell, I tried to train you, you refused to be trained. You think you know 
everything. You were as full of beans, you wa
nt to fight, well do Œ surely we fight, but 
are going to lose people constantly if you don™t 
want to train.ﬂ So they said, ﬁDo anything 
that Œ to train us.ﬂ So we did. For about four  weeks, we got the guts out of ourselves. We  
did it the British way. The way the British Major Thompson did to us, we did to 
ourselves. From then on we became almost invincible. We would lose a person from time 

to time, but very, very seldom. 
 
04:26:00 
 
Q: You took some  time and sort of dropped back in the countryside and Œ 
 
A: We  drop back to countryside, we took a week or two off, then we Œ most of the time we 
found the places we wanted to take care of ourselves. Some time our comma nder would 
contact us and gave us Œ gave us an order to do this or to do that. And there was a Œ one 
of the Eisengrupp Œ Eisens Œ Eis Œ Eins
atzgruppen in neighborhood where my Œ not 
exactly my own family neighborhood, but close by. It was in a town called Biala

Podlaska. It was about 100 kilome ters east of Wa rsaw. There was the group that was 
large, it was very well entrenched. Very, very foxy, we just couldn™t do anything to them. 
So he called me  the carpet and he said, ﬁYou are supposed to take care of that group. You 
don™t saŒ you don™t have to kill all of them, but really give them a good thrashing.ﬂ I 

said, ﬁCommander, I tried Œ we tried everyt hing, I tried everything, nothing works.ﬂ Said, 
ﬁYou have to do some thing.ﬂ ﬁThey are entrenched. They stay in a solid building, which 
used to be monastery, with a great gate. They built a wall around, there™s some barbed 

wire on the top of it. There™s electricity in the barbed wire. We just can™t touch them.ﬂ So 
he said, ﬁWell, we can, come  on here.ﬂ Led me  to the next room, open a wardrobe and he 
said, ﬁLook at this. You see this nice, little Hitlerjugend
40
 uniform? ﬂ  And I said, ﬁOh, no 
you don™t.ﬂ Said, ﬁOh yes, I do.ﬂ And as you can see, I was a little blonde boy Œ little 
blonde boy, this one on the right. This one here, with blue eyes and very, very bleached, 
bleached hair. So he said, ﬁPut it on.ﬂ So I put the thing, fitted me just right and a little Œ 

little Œ little jacket, shorts, you know. High socks, hobnail boots, little dagger, little hat. 
Said, ﬁThere, you look like a damn German Hitlerjugend.ﬂ So I didn™t have much choice.  
 
04:28:40 
 
In the afternoon, the boys brought me  within about two or three blocks from that 
monastery. I just walked toward the gates, there were two burly SS me n with the 
Schmeissers standing by the gate. And I said, ﬁHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler.
41
 Wi e geht™s denn, 
Junge
42
ﬂ ﬁGanz gut.
43
ﬂ ﬁHow are you young ma n? ﬂ ﬁVery well.ﬂ ﬁWie geht™s denn, Herr 
Oberst.
44
ﬂ How about you, Comma nder?  ﬁGanz gut.ﬂ So I said, ﬁI - Ich wünschte mit ihre 
officer gesprochen.
45
ﬂ I want to speak to your officer, your commander here. ﬁWeiter-
weitermachen.
46
ﬂ ﬁGo right in.ﬂ So I went in, I went through the corridors, I went up the 
steps, I went to the back there and there was an outside window, I unlatched the window. 

I went downstairs again, I went to the back and I notice there™s a gate there with a bolt, so 
I pulled the bolt slowly out. Then I went to the corrŒ second floor again Œ again had to go 

to second floor to go to the front, so I walked. There was some  secretaries running out 
and some  officers running back and forth. ﬁHeil Hitler, Heil Hitler, Junge.
47
 Wi e  
geht™s.
48
ﬂ I walked out. Said, ﬁAuf wiedersehen,
49
ﬂ to those nice, two, big son of a so and 
so in the front. Wa lked out to the corner, walked beyond Œ about a block away, the boys 

are waiting with the car, they grabbed me , we ran away. I was so ma d at myself. I wet my

pants. My pants were wet, my socks were wet, my shoes were squelching. I must have 
been afraid. And strange enough, I was in tougher places. I was being shot at, I was being 
hit, I was being mutilated, practically, but this must have been scary time that I had had. 
Was first and the last time that I wetted my pants. That night we came in and the 

comma nder came with us. B. Dab came with us. He said, ﬁYou know where everything 
is, so you go in.ﬂ So I went with my big rucksack. And then we came with a ladder, we™re 
going to climb to that window there.

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We ™re outside of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape five. 
So you were going into theŒ?  
 
A: Yes, lucky enough, they did not board the back door. But we came with big oil cans and 
we oiled all the hinges, you know, and Œ and my comma nder said, ﬁWell, you know 

where everything is, you will go in.ﬂ Said, ﬁMe?  Wa s supposed to be somebody else 
going in.ﬂ ﬁOh, shut up and go in.ﬂ So I went in, I set sevŒ set up 17 charges, one for 

each boy in the outfit and we blew the place sky high. It just blew up. There was a 
armory, and I notice where it was, I put a charge on the door to the armory. Whatever 
they had there Œ it must have been a lot of explosives Œ blew up. And of course, some  of 

them were running out of the front gate and the back gate and we met them in the street, 
too. And I don™t know how ma ny were left, but there were some  left, I presume. And of 
course, then we took off and Œ and got the hell out of there. That was a feather in my hat. 
 
Q: Where would you go after something like that?  
 
A: We  just went out for Œ far away from 
it, as far as we could from the neighborhood. 
Some time we had horses, some time we had horse-wagons. Occasionally we would have a 
truck, produce truck that we ﬁborrowedﬂ from the Germans. We ll, we would just stop a 
driver and take him away and appropriate the truck. Take his uniform and one of us 

would dress in it and we would have it ready after a job like this. And actually, this thing, 
strange enough, did not have ma ny repercussions. ﬁThe armory blew up. There™s Œ 
some thing happen, the armory blew up.ﬂ The German papers were saying, ﬁthe armory 

blew up and some  of our people were hurt.ﬂ 
 
Q: Maybe they didn™t want to acknowledge that there was Œ 
 
A: They did not want to acknowledge, apparently. So then we had a week of rest. My 
comma nder said, ﬁNow you deserve a rest.ﬂ And I said, ﬁAre you going to gift me  with 
that Hitlerjugend uniform? ﬂ  ﬁOh no, that is useful Œ that will be for some body else. You 
pissed it, you so and so.ﬂ I said, ﬁListen Dab, I was scared.ﬂ ﬁWell, I think you were 

scared, but you should have been scared before hand, not when you were right there.ﬂ 
 
05:03:10 
 
Q: What did you do when you had a week off?  A week of rest, as you put it. 
 
A: Occasionally, I would visit my family, but very seldom. But most of the time I would 
stay in the forest and enjoy it and bring some  good food and have a drinking party. And 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387  
37 
 
occasionally we™d have a drinking party with the Mongol people. Wanted Œwanted to 
demolish a track, or a trail, demolish a train. And the Germans had the Mongolians, from 
outer Mongolia, who volunteered to serve the Germans. They placed them along the 
railroad tracks to guard it. So, when we wanted to blow up a train, we just go for about 

two or three kilometers and collect bunch of those people and invite them to a party. 
Course they had to come  if they wanted or not. They didn™t want to get shot. So we 
would provide a few gallons of moonshine and some  smoked meat and a lot of bread, 

we™d have a party with them, get them roaring drunk and then we would wait for the Œ we 
knew when the train that Œ in question was comi ng in there, with arma me nt or with a 
group of soldiers going to the eastern front. And we would try to blow it up. Some times 

succeeded, some time not. After we Œ after not, my comma nder would call on me  and 
said, ﬁYou little so and so, what™s the ma tter with you?  Losing your touch? ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, 
sir, I am losing my touch.ﬂ ﬁLet that not happen again.ﬂ ﬁYes sir, it will never happen 

again.ﬂ If it happened next time, he said, ﬁYou forgot you said never again.ﬂ ﬁWellﬂ, said, 
ﬁwell, I thought I Œ maybe I would be dead before next time.ﬂ 
 
Q: We re you wearing uniforms at all, or were you Œ 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Œ just Œ 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were in Œ how Œ how did that work?  We re you Œ and then in civilian clothes?  
 
A: We had civilian clothes. We had kind of a sports Œ like a sweatsuit set, something similar 
to it. Some body of a got hold of German overalls. Occasionally Œ later Œ later on, after we 

appropriated a lot of German uniforms, those that were not very bloody, we would Œ we 
would wear. Matter of fact, we had them tailored, beautiful tailored. We  had a Jewish 

tailor, Mr. Œ Mr. Grzebien, who could make a beautiful fitting outfit, regardless what it 
was. And poor Mr. Grzebien did not ma ke it. 
 
Q: So Œ so if you Œ I guess what I™m trying to get a sense of is, were you openly an army unit 
in Poland?  
 
A: No, we were not. 
 
Q: Or were you Œ you were passing as civilians and then at certain times you™d goŒ 
 
A: We  were passing a Œ we were passing as civilians.

Q: Okay. 
 
A: But most of the time we stayed a unit Œ we stayed as unit and went constantly from Œ we 
did not stay in one place for more than tw
o nights, went from place to place and found 
the places to hit and found the places to demolish or got orders to move here or to move 
there. And then, after we felt that we were
 too unnerved, we would stŒ we would take a 
few days rest. Occa-occasionally some  of us would go for a short visit, but very seldom 
because Germans had also quite good Intelligence. And they had a lot of local people 
who were reporting to them. So you had to be careful where you go, when you go. Like, 

for instance, I don™t know if I was that religious, but frequently on Sunday I would sneak 
into the church, to my pastor. And he was friend of mi ne, I read all his books. I read all 
the books in the public library and school library and I discovered he had a big library, so 

I read all of his books and I served Mass. Oh my God, I served Mass forever, I was 19 
and 20, I still served Mass. So he would say, ﬁOh Stefan, come  on, serve the Mass.ﬂ 
ﬁFather, I can™t. I messed up last night, I blew up a train. There were people on that train 

Œ,ﬂ or else I did something. ﬁCome on, I™ll listen to your confeŒ I™ll hear your confession. 
Come  on, serve the Mass.ﬂ ﬁBut I™m too old.ﬂ ﬁOh, you™re so little, nobody will know.ﬂ 
So he gave me  key to the wardrobe, he kept, ﬁPut your Œ put your items in a keŒﬂ I put Œ 

put my trench coat and my Schmeisser and a bunch of boxes of my ma gazines of 
ammunition in his wardrobe, lock it up, serve the Mass. And then he said, ﬁOkay, now 
you can go.ﬂ So before he walked out, I would go into sacristy, unlock, jump out of a 

window and disappear. He was a good old ma n. 
 
Q: Do you reme mber his name ?  
 
A: Yeah,Ksiadz
50
 Miazga. 
 
05:08:22 
 
Q: This was your parish priest?  
 
A: My parish priest, Ksiadz Miazga. He was older. He was patriotic. And I would tell him 
that I really can™t serve Mass, nor can I go to communion Œ what I did. ﬁI can™t sleep 
nights, my conscience bothers me, cause some of the people that we exterminated were 
not really willingly going there.ﬂ Said, ﬁEve
rybody who is EinŒ in Einsatzgruppe went 
willingly. And if you did kill some  soldiers on the train, some  officers, this is a war.ﬂ 
Anyways, I still occasionally spend sleepless night. So, it lasted Œ it was good when it 
lasted. And then in spring, early spring of 1944, I was caught in a lapanka. Lapanka is a 

round-up, like they caught slaves in Africa, like they go hunting and have a Œ surround 
me ters and hunters. In Poland, the lapanka was an institution. The group of German 
Schutzpolizei
51
 would stop a train or a bus, mostly train, get everybody out, fish out all

the young people, put them in trucks, take them to process, processing, transit, camp 
building. And in our district, was the Skaryszew
ska, it was an Œ name after the Œ after the 
street in Wa rsaw, ﬁSkaryszewskaﬂ Œ processed you and sent you to compulsory labor in 

Germany. It was called the ﬁfree labor.ﬂ So I left what I was carrying Œ I was carrying a 

suitcase of dynamite and some wiring, so I left it on the train. It was Œ I was a little boy, 
caught on a train traveling between Wa rsaw and Œ and whatever.  
 
05:11:03 
 
And of course I was sent to western part Œ I™m sorry, eastern part of Germany, Silesia. 
Then there was almost like a Œ like a slave market. They took us to that Kreuzburg town, 
small town like a county town, Kreuzburg. We  were kept Œ put in a Œ in a building next to 
a square Œ there we be walked out to the square and then farmers and people from 

different little factories, shops and so on, would come. ﬁI™ll take this one, I™ll take that 
one, I™ll take that one.ﬂ ﬁOkay. Here™s your aiŒ,ﬂ they filled out an arbeitbuch,
52
 a little 
work book for you Œ your name  and your employers name  and you went and you were 

servant to that person. If you got to be on a farm, it wasn™t too bad, because you had 
enough to eat. A group of us Œ the group of us, about 25 boys and 23 girls, between like 

13 and 19 or so, were put in a village called Schorka and we worked in a forest, natching 
out the trees, pine trees and collecting the resin. Resin was used by German industry for 
ma king synthetic rubber. So we worked there about eight hours a day, worked in a group 

with a supervisor. And sometime the Stadtpolizei
53
  worked with us, they try and they did 
not. So, some  of us would be escaping now and then, of course, they would be 
apprehended and brought back and so on and so forth. And I worked there for, oh, 
probably three or four weeks. So a small 
group of us took off and went away. So, ﬁI 

would Œ won™t work for the damn Germans here. Let us go home.ﬂ And the home was a 
general government the center of Poland, which was so called ﬁFree Poland,ﬂ it was 
under Œ it was a protectorate, Hans Frank was the gover-governor and it was run by the 

Germans, for the Germans, by the Germans and the Poles who were there had to give 
everything that they produced, they raised on the farm and so on, to the German war 
effort. But you were kind of semi -free. Anyway, those of us who were in the underground 

were free because we could go anyplace we want to. 
 
05:13:47 
 
Q: So you just walked away from Schorka Œ from the resin work camp?  
 
A: Yes, yes. I w Œ just walked away. Partway home, close to town called Lubliniec and 
closer to little town called Blachownia, we split Œ we got chased by some 
Volksdeutsche
54
 people with shotguns. And I ran into couple young boys and they were

 the boys from the forest, who were in the same  part of Polish 
underground that I was. So we talked, we introduced ourselves. And he says, ﬁHow come  
Œ,ﬂ asked, ﬁwhere are you from? ﬂ  ﬁOh, I am from Wa rsaw district.ﬂ ﬁHow come  you™re 
here? ﬂ ﬁWell, I got caught, spend time in Germany, now I™m escaping.ﬂ ﬁOkay, come 

with us, we have a job to do. Are you Œ do you know anything about wet works? ﬂ ﬁOh, a 
little.ﬂ ﬁWell, you know, there is a Gestapo man who is such a son of a bitch, he mi streats 
people, he beats people, he shot some people, he killed some people during interrogation. 

And we want to do some thing willaŒ with him, but we are not Œ we got the sentence, 
death sentence for him from the Œ our underground authorities, the NSZ.ﬂ The National Œ 
NSZ, which was the National Arme d Forces. Narodowe Sily Zbrojne,
56
 in Polish. That 
was the Œ kind of a rightish wing of the Polish underground. The Armi a Krajowa
57
 Œ the 
Home  Army was kind of a mi ddle Œ the A.L., A.L. Œ Armi a Ludowa
58
 were the 
Communists and we were the Œ toward the right some what. ﬁWell, we are NSZ Œ we are 
NSZ and we have problems, we don™t know how to proceed, so we Œ,ﬂ I stayed with them 
for a few days and got some arms fr om them and instructed them and they were still 

afraid, so we did Œ we went and we did the job, according to the rules.  
 
05:16:18 
 
We  me t him in a park, with a wife and two children, one was in a carriage, one was 

walking. So we ask him to excuse himself and we excuse the lady and we walk him a 
short distance, we read him the sentence. And 
of course after we left, he Œ he was dead. 
And I should have known better, I should have gotten the hell out of there, but I stayed 

for a few more days and there was some body who reported. And they came and I was so 
well trained and I became sloppy. I was too lucky for too long. I survived too long. I 
became sloppy and careless and my goose was cooked. I stayed with a family in a 

Blachownia Œ Blachstadt(ph) in German. And it was kind of a storage room in a 
backyard, I stayed there. And they came at about one a.m. We  had a shootout. Two of  
those two who first came in, one was dead and one was badly wounded. And they shot 

across and they killed another one of their own. And I jumped out of a window, I thought 
I would Œ I was free to get out. And then I got hit from behind. I don™t know what 
happened after that. When I was up to Œ I had a few broken ribs. I was badly kicked and 

mutilated, practically trampled into the soil in that little garden there. And then Œ that my 
Œ my gar Œ goose got cooked. They transported me to Lubliniec, which was a district 
town and a investigator came from my neighborhood, east of Wa rsaw.

A: German, yeah. Gestapo officer came from
 Wa rsaw. He was Ph.D. from Heidelberg 
University. He was highly educated person. And he joined the Nazi party, of course. He 
didn™t know any better. And he became special investigator for the Gestapo. He 
introduced himself and when he came in, the people who led him in, they said, ﬁWhere 

you from? ﬂ  So he told them. And said, ﬁYou know, wir hat die schlange, wir hat die 
schlange.
59
ﬂ ﬁWe have the snake.ﬂ Because where I came from, they call me the 
schlange
60
 Œ the schlange, yeah the Germans. Because I lived forever and lasted foreve-
forever, so they called me the snake. ﬁWir hat die schlange.ﬂ We talked for five days and 

for five nights. He would not let me  slee
p. He would go and take a nap now and then, 
some body else talked to me . After five 24 hour talks, he said, ﬁYou know, I think we 
became friends and I thŒ and I thought you were going to tell me everything that you 
know. Really, I™m your friend. I don™t want to hurt you, I want to do anything. But you 
didn™t tell me a damn thing. So we™ll try something else.ﬂ And I was just out of my Œ 

completely out of myself. I was sleepy, I was hungry, I was thirsty. So the first thing he 
did Œ he would Œ they would give me a little water now and then, but I don™t think I ate 
anything for those five days and five nights. 
So then the first thing he did, he brought a 
big dish of ice water and gave me  a big spoon. He said, ﬁSit and eat. If you don™t finish it 
off, I™m going to shoot you right here.ﬂ The most horrible thing in you life can be eating 
ice water with a spoon. What Œ it was probably a gallon and a half, ma ybe two gallons. If 

you try sometime, this is almost like a Chinese torture, maybe even worse. I ate the whole 
darn thing. And I was just getting out of my mi nd. So he would not let me  go to the 
bathroom, so I just sat in a chair and made a big puddle on the floor, several times.  
 
05:21:17 
 
And then he called two me n Œ two big, strong me n and they gave me  hell for about two 

hours. I was in and out several times. I didn™t know what was happening to me . Then 
they would pour a pile of water on me , I would come  back to it and they gave me  Œ and 
beat me again. So then he asked questions and I apparently didn™t tell him very much, so 

he said, ﬁOkay, take him in a swing.ﬂ So they took my clothes off, they tied my hands on 
and Œ my hands like this, put a broomstick here, put it on the top of the stools and I was 
swinging back and forth. And one of them was swinging hose, rubber hose, hitting my 

behind. ﬁAnd talk and tell me this and tell me that. Well, you know about siŒ something 
about this? ﬂ So I was prepared, I told him blue streak. I told him Œ oh, I told him tall 
stories. All the people, all the name s, who were dead. So then he left me Œ left me  alone 

and he went and checked and he came back. He said, ﬁYou didn™t tell me  a thing.ﬂ So 
they gave me beating again and beating again and beating again. And then he said, ﬁWell, 
that™s enough, we are ready.ﬂ So I had a Œ and normally, I mean, they just took out Œ they 

shoot you. They shoot everybody in the neighborhood and this case, they wanted to be so 
legalistic, they wanted to be so exact, that I had a case in court. I had a defense attorney,

Mr. Heinrich Schmidt. Yeah, Heinrich Schmidt. And he was telling Œ he was talk to the 
court Œ it was the Volksgericht.
61
 People who did not have any training in law, appointed 
by the German authorities to deal punishment sentences. So, my attorney was asking for 
three death sentences. And the Œ I don™t remember Œ or did Œ I don™t know if I ever knew 
the name  of the judge. He said, ﬁTwo, enough. Zwei ganz genug. Zwei ganz genug.
62
ﬂ So 
he gave me  two death sentences. And then he stamped ﬁN and Nﬂ on my document. ﬁN 
and Nﬂ is, is ﬁNacht und Nebel.
63
ﬂ ﬁNight and fog.ﬂ  
 
05:24:05 
 
A person who got a sentence Œ who even did not get a sentence, but had an N and N on 
his documents, he was sent to concentration camp, he was finished off Œ taken to the gas 
chamber or given an injection Œ phenol injection. Or went to the bunker to starve to 
death, or got mutilated or got hung in a Œ in a camp square. His documents were 

destroyed. His ashes were Œ his family was not notified to send seven ma rks for the 
ashes. You disappeared just like in a night and fog. So I was the Nacht und Nebel baby. I 
stayed in prison, in Lubliniec for two, three weeks. I healed. I could sleep on my back. 

When I got there, I could sleep only on my stomach. There were 17 of us in a two person 
cell. We slept like sardines in a can on the floor. And the one who was the latest, had to 
sleep next to kübel.
64
 And kübel was a garbage pail that everybody emptied themselves. 
So I slept next to the kübel for about a week. And of course I advanced, later on. But 
after about two or three nights, they looked at me, at my back and they said, ﬁWell, 
maybe you should move little here. Maybe we can put you in that corner, there,ﬂ ‚cause I, 

ﬁyou don™t look so great.ﬂ 
 
Q: What do you think gave you strength to endure that?  
 
A: I don™t know. I was ornery. I was so damn patriotic. And I was very strongly religious. 
And I was very ornery.  
 
Q: Goodcombination. 
 
A: Yes. It was a good combination.

A: Yes, I did. I prayed a lot. And I Œ actually I never prayed for anything. I prayed Œ I still 
have a taŒ hard time praying for anything. Like for instance, presently I pray in 
thanksgiving that I™m still alive, can take nourishment, I can run a mile, I can skate, I can 
do some  skiing. And I™m 75 and counting. So I never prayed for some thing, not even for 

release, not even for a longer life. I knew I wouldn™t live to be 20. I was sure I would 
never live to be, to, to, to be ninetŒ 19 and a half or 20. I was Œ by that time I was almost 
19. I never Œ I knew I was not going to live. But I prayed and I was so thankful that I was 

still alive. Anyway, after the sentence, I stayed there in a prison for a short time, then I 
went on a transport to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, which is in western Poland 
presently. At that time it was in eastern East Germany, close to Opole, German Oppeln. I 

was there in transit, in the block number 12, which was a subterranean block. It was a 
time Œ it was just a time when Polish Prince Radziwill
65
 was sent to Gross-Rosen. The 
Germans wanted him to from Polish governme nt under German auspices and he refused. 

So they sent him to concentration camp. 
He was a brother-in-law of Mrs. Kennedy. 
Kennedy™s Œ Mrs. Kennedy™s sister ma rried one of the Œ his Œ that Polish Prince 
Radziwill, who was in Great Britain then. A
nyway, Prince Radziwill came with a servant. 
And after they were told that sup Œ they took him Œ the serŒ took the servant away. They 
gave a black number, black triangle and sent him to the stone quarry. And the person who 

received black triangle was Œ went to saŒ to 
stone quarry, was not to survive. So his Kapo 
told him, ﬁPrince, I™m going to kill you, over the next week or two, so if you want to 
jump, go ahead.ﬂ So he jumped. 
 
Q: Were you there?  
 
A: No.

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We ™re outside of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. It™s conducted Œ this interview is conducted by Katie Davis and 
this is tape number six. First of all, I just want to say that this is May 1994, about and you 
were just telling the story of the prince. How, how Œ you didn™t witness that, butŒ 
 
A: No, I didn™t have to witness, but I spoke to one people who had a black number and was 
in the quarry. He came and by that time I developed a friendship with a Blockältester,
66
 
who was a Polish young boy, who was killing people right and left, to survive. Killing 
prisoners right and left, to survive. When I first came, we got into that barrack, we were 
put three people to the bunk and a bunk was about two and a half foot wide. Three people 

to a bunk and bunks were three piles high. So I went in the corner between the bunk and I 
stood against the wall, because my back, my seat, my Œ was kind of awful. And the 
Blockältester was a young Warsaw boy who became a killer to survive. He came and he 

said, ﬁWhat do you think you are doing, you stupid so and so? ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I am 
resting.ﬂ ﬁGet in the bunk.ﬂ I said, ﬁBlockältester, I cannot get in a bunk.ﬂ ﬁWhy not? ﬂ 
So, I turned around and lifted my clothes. ﬁUh-huh. Come  on.ﬂ So norma lly, when you 

said, ‚come on™, you were going to get 25 with a ax handle or Œ or a Œ or a rubber 
truncheon. So he led me  to his little room and he said, ﬁTake your clothes and lay down.ﬂ 
So Œ ﬁThis is my bunk, lay down.ﬂ So I lay down and he brought a Œ a towel, he brought 

a pail of water. He washed my back. He had some  kind of an ointme nt that he put on me . 
And he said, ﬁYou cannot turn, can you? ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, I cannot turn.ﬂ ﬁOkay, you can 
sleep on my stomach. I can go and get my Œ see my girlfriend.ﬂ So he went. Before 

morning he came back and said, ﬁNow you can go back there and be one of the prisoners. 
And don™t let me catch you again standing there. Go to bed. Cause if you don™t, I™ll kill 
you.ﬂ 
 
06:03:03 
 
Q: Did he mean it?  
 
A: Yes, he did. There were some  people who 
were in position, occasionally they would give 
you Œ do you a favor. But don™t ever ask them for a second favor, because that was the 
end of you. I met many people like that later Œ later on in Mauthausen. Anyway, I stayed 
there for a short duration and just about the same time, a bishop from my archdiocese Œ I 

can™t ever reme mber his name , from Siedlce, came. He lasted only four days. They put 
him into Strafkomma ndo.
67
 People who were carrying big loads of stone with a 
wheelbarrow. So he was pushing a wheelbarrow, he was an old ma n Œ I mean he was old,

he was in his 40™s or 50™s. And he Œ the Kapo
68
 beat him constantly. He survived either 
four or five days. They beat him to death. 
 
06:04:13 
 
Q: Were you working at that time?  
 
A: I™msorry? 
 
Q: Were they having you work at that time?  
 
A: No, we stayed in the barrack. We  were a kind of a zugang
69
 people Œ new prisoners in 
transit. So about Œ I can™t even reme mber how ma ny it was Œ eight or nine days, we put Œ 
were put on a transport and went, and went, and went all the way to Mauthausen. Came 
to Mauthausen, got shaved, got disinfected, we
nt to the showers, were given a pair of 
clodhoppers, wooden shoes and a prison uniform and went to a barrack. Barracks zwei 
und zwanzig
70
 Œ  the first quarantine. There was a main camp and a first quarantine. First 
quarantine they had barracks 21, 22, 23. After that there was a wall, there was 24 and 25, 

but those were the bunker barracks, where people went, never to get out. Anyway, 
barrack 22 was the barrack of the people with ﬁN and N.ﬂ So we went to a little chamber 

where they gave shots, phenol, derivative of gasoline. It is the most horrible death you 
can ever have. You die for about 45 mi nutes. That courses through your veins, gets into 
your heart several times, and you just die in a horrible torment. Just the worse thing ever. 

I saw dead people who died that way. They looked like the gargoyles on Notre-Dame  
Cathedral. Or they went on a transport, or went to Gusen Zwei,
71
 never to come  out. Or 
they went to gas chamber, or they went on special transport behind the front line. If 

some thing happened behind the front line, in a town or village, they would hang 10, 15, 
20 local hostages and let them hang there for Œ sometime for weeks. If they did not have 

local people, they would bring people from concentration camp and execute them there. 
But for some strange reason, after a very short time, I was whisked out, my number was 
read, I was put by the gate with 500 people. We marched again to the train depot, which 

was about like three, four kilometers, through the little town of Mauthausen. Put on a 
train and went to Vienna. And put in a concentration camp which was a sub-camp of 
Mauthausen, 11

 And we™re put to work in an arma me nt

And I became a great machine operator. I mean, I learned in a hurry. I had a good master. 
He was a German engineer, a civilian. He put me  on machine, he showed me  how to do 
things. I was turning openings and grinding the huge blocks for the big, big heavy motor 
for the Œ was a horrible work, it was 12 hours a day. The food was bad. Most of what we 

were supposed to get, the people who handled it stole and ate and gorged themselves on. 
It wasn™t too bad, actually. When I think back, it wasn™t too bad. I got beaten a few times 
by the SS me n, but it wasn™t too bad. 
 
06:08:42 
 
Q: Why?  What would you do that bothered them?  
 
A: We ll, I think it™s Œ you Œ you looked wrong way, he came and slugged you. And one time 
Œ oh, my gosh, I never forget that. There was a little SS ma n, my size Œ big, fat thing. He 
was just kind of a, a roly-poly thing and he walked with a rifle. The rifle was three times 
as big as he is. And we walked the factory in a fives Œ you know, row Œ I me an fives Œ in 

kind of ma rching. And I look and I said, ﬁLook at that little son of a bitch. He is my size 
and he is so damn fat. If he falls over, he is going to roll forever.ﬂ And he understood 
Polish. And he got after me . And the boys hid me  and we were just in the gate, so I ran 

quickly into the factory and got to my machine. And he was walking back and forth and 
watching and walking, looking for me . And every time he walked, I would duck behind 
the machine. I had a young Russian boy working with me , I would duck behind the 

machine. And he never found me . He would have probably finished me .  
 
Q: Your mouth, your mouth did get away with you, didn™t it?  Get away from you 
sometimes. 
 
A: I couldn™t escape that. Many times my mouth ran away from me. 
 
Q: So how long did you stay at this arma me nt factory?  
 
A: It was a chore for the authorities. I stayed there fr om Œ oh my gosh, fr om October, 
November, until the second part of January, I think. I think so Œ does it say so?  
 
Q: Mm-hm. 
 
A: Yes. Because Œ because every– 
 
[Technical conversation] 
 
A: Yes, the situation was such, they had a Œ I was a, I was a bloody headache for them. 
Because every four weeks, two big, burly SS people would bundle me  up, take me  on the 
train, we would go to Mauthausen, 120 kilome ters in the train and I would be taken out to

the Politische Abteilung
74
, Gestapo office outside of camp. I would be asked some  
questions and I would get the treatment that I couldn™t sit for next two weeks, and back to 
work. Every four weeks, every four weeks. 
 
Q: They continued these interrogations and beatings?  
 
A: Interrogate my case. The reason why they didn™t finish me  off was because, ﬁYou™re case 
ŒDu kleine Schlange,
75
 your, your case is not yet finished. Your case is not yet finished, 
so we have to ask you a few more questions.ﬂ 
 
Q: But what were they asking you?  
 
A: ﬁWell, what happened then?  Did you blow the train?  How ma ny people in your group?  
Give me their names. Who was your commander?  What are the other groups around?  

What did you go this place?  When you go that place?  How come  Œ how come  at one 
time, you were by Smolensk?  How come  at one time you were by Minsk Œ the Soviet 

Minsk?  Can you explain?  Can you tell? ﬂ 
 
06:12:44 
 
Q: And what would you do?  
 
A: Well, I made the tall stories, I talk blue streak. I tried not to repeat myself, I tried not to 
change what I told before. As I said, I do Œ I did have a good memory. I could memorize 
pages and pages of Œ I could memorize the 45 mi nutes of a propaganda talk. I didn™t mi ss 
a word the second time. Anyway, and they would let me  go. ﬁWell, that™s enough for 

now. We ™ll see you in four weeks.ﬂ So the authorities in Vienna apparently got sick and 
tired of it, so for a time, they put me  on a bomb squad. There were fifeeŒ 50 people and 
after Americans started bombing Vienna Œ they came first in All Saint™s Day, in 1944 and 

bombed the bejesus out of Vienna. They say there about 1200 American super fortress 
came. You couldn™t see sun, you couldn™t see anything for three days Œ fires. And they 
kept burning Œ Bezirk, district, 21, 22 and 23. A
ll those three days. And finally they hit Œ 
there was a Tiergarten,
76
 there was a park there and under the park there were enormous 
tanks Œ buried tanks of aviation gasoline. And they finally Œ the third night they hit, and 
the thing was boiling horribly. Because my factory lost all the roof too and we worked, 
you know, January Œ worked practically outside. We  danced, we jumped. We  tried to put 

cardboard in our jackets. If you got caught with a cardboard, you were beaten severely, 
some times shot. So finally they got tired of it, they took me  back to Mauthausen.

Q: I want to ask you a question about the interrogations, though. They Œ they went on for a 
long time and they were brutal. Was there ever a point that you said, ﬁYou know, I can™t 
do this any more? ﬂ 
 
A: Forget it. You do it. You do it. I tell him, ﬁI don™t reme mber any more.ﬂ ﬁOh, you 
remember a lot. We will try something else.ﬂ So then something else, when I came back 

to Mauthausen, the first two days Œ I was on block 22 again. Block where people got Œ 
who were not supposed to leave. And two days later I was called in and there said, ﬁWell, 

we™ll try some thing else.ﬂ So they ma de me  take my shoes off and I Œ leaned me  on a 
chair and beat my heels. And this is the most horrible feeling. When they hit your heel, it 
feels like your brain wants to jump out. And Œ it was part of it Œ one of the stupid, 

untrained henchmen hit my foot and broke a m Œ broke my Œ my Œ some  bones in my 
feet. Now I am a walking barome ter. If Œ if the rain is comi ng tomorrow, I know there is 
going to be rain, because my foot bothers me . My heels were just like balloons. So I 

talked to some prisoners there, they said, ﬁWe just yell a lot.ﬂ So, as from then on, 
whenever they took me  there, before they hit me , I would scream bloody murder. I would 
yell, I would swear up and down. I would talk in Russian, I would talk in Polish. So they 

brought Russian and Polish interpreter, thinking that I was going to spill something. I 
would just talk blue streak. And I knew little Samoyed language, I would talk some  
Samoyed, cause then they would Œ later I™m sitting down, ﬁWhat did you say then?  What 

did you say?  What did you say then? ﬂ I said, ﬁI was just complaining.ﬂ ﬁWhat was the 
language you are talking to? ﬂ I said, ﬁI was talking in a language, probably Latin.ﬂ 
Because I Œ I had several years of Latin.  
 
06:16:50 
 
Q: But when you got back, did anybody take care of you?  You must have been really hurt 
when you would get back to the barracks. 
 
A: Oh, you were just dumped a barrack and you took care of yourself. I get some  friends in 
the barrack who occasionally would bring me  some  Œ like an ointme nt from the 
Krankenhaus.
77
 Actually the block secretary was a Polish ma n who took pity upon me  
frequently and he would bring me  some thing. But I had a bunk all to myself, not two or 

three people, but to myself. At least after Œ for a week or so after I was Œ I went through a 
treatme nt. So I was in that barrack and was in a barrack and then of course and, and 

actually that interrogation and my ﬁN and Nﬂ came Œ I mean it came to pass in late 
January, I think. 
 
Q: Was this ‚45?

Q: Nineteenforty-five?  
 
06:17:50 
 
A: Forty Œ ‚45, ‚45. My number was list Œ it was called and a few other numbers were called 
and were called, we™re taken to the Grosse Tor,
78
 the great gate. And I said, ﬁOh-oh. I 
guess my cooked Œ my goose has been cooked.ﬂ So we were taken, 12 of us Œ we were 
taken to Effektenkammer
79
. Effektenkamme r was that big warehouse with the best, 
beautiful thing, that came with people who went directly to gas, were stored. Beautiful 

suit, beautiful boots, silk underwear and so on. So we got dressed like a Œ dressed well. I 
got silken underwear, I had beautiful socks. I had beautiful Hungarian boots. Woolen 

suit, tie Œ silk tie, fur hat, fur coat. They would put us by the gate and the prisoners were 
come  in and said, ﬁMan, look at the bunch of Jewish barons. What did Œ where do those 
come  from? ﬂ  And one of my friends came by and I said, ﬁHey.ﬂ He said, ﬁDon™t hey me , 

you so and so civilian.ﬂ I said, ﬁDidn™t you recognize me?ﬂ And he says, ﬁNo, what are 
you doing in that stuff? ﬂ I said, ﬁGod knows. I was dressed up.ﬂ He said, ﬁUh-oh.ﬂ 
Anyway, when we™re Œ when we were in Effektenkamme r, I had a friend Œ a friend who 

works there because I work part time before then, in a Kanadakommando
80
 sorting those 
goods. So he gave me  a bundle of jewelry. He said, ﬁIf you go on a trip, ma ybe you can 
buy your way out.ﬂ And he gave me  a Polish ma rine knife. So I tucked it in. We ™re 
standing there and pretty soon, SS squad came and we hiked to that depot, about three 

kilometers to the train and they put us in a prison compartments Œ went on a trip. And on 
the train, there was one SS ma n who was comi ng back and forth Œ comi ng back and forth, 
looking. And he came to a window, I, ﬁHerr, Herr OberŒ OberŒ Herr Oberst, can you tell 

me  where we are going? ﬂ And he looked, he said, ﬁWhat is u Œ what is worth to you? ﬂ I 
said, ﬁTwo carats? ﬂ ﬁGanz gut. Hand it over.ﬂ So I gave him a ring with a big diamond. 
ﬁWell,ﬂ he said, ﬁLa himmel, la himmel.
81
ﬂ  ﬁTo paradise.ﬂ He said, ﬁThere™s a little town 
east of Oppeln Œ of Opole. Some thing happened behind the front line, they don™t have 
local hostages, so you people are it. So you Œ norma lly, you know, they took you there, 
they took you finery off, they put Œ put on you paper suits. They filled your mouth with a 

Œ with gypsum, so you couldn™t yell, took you out and hanged you in a ma rketplace. So 
that was it. Said, ﬁOh gosh, now I got to watch. I have that knife, I have all the jewelry.ﬂ 
Nothing do it Œ doing. We nt to Vienna, they backed up prison van to the train and two 

people with truncheons and two people with machine guns Œ into, into it, they drove into 
Œ us to the Elizabethpromenade Œ huge prison, put us in a cell. Next morning, likewise. 
Put us in a train. We  went through Budejovice, we went as far as Brno in 

Czechoslovakia. They put us in old Franciscan monastery that was made into prison. The 
walls, they were 12 foot thick walls. That was a fortress. But I see, in quite a big cell,

there were 12 of us and there were another 15 of others. Anyway, there were girls next 
door. So we made a hole in that Œ well, it wasn™t just the big, it was like a plaster wall, so 
we ma de a hole and I laid whole night talking to girls. Bunch of Czech, pretty Czech 
girls. They send me a paper, they send me a piece of candy and we talk blue streak all 

night. And the next night and the next night  and those people who are with me , those 
prisoners who are with me  said, ﬁMy goshﬂ Œ those were Bibelforscher
82
 people, those 
were Baptist people. And he said, ﬁWe are supposed to be freed when we get to Œ to 

Opole, we™re supposed to be freed.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁWell, count your blessings, if you get freed, 
you™ll get freed.ﬂ Anyway, the fourth day, we™re put on a train, say goodbye to the pretty 
girls across the street Œ across the wall Œ put us in a train. And we keep watching and I 
see the same  views. We  were going through Vienna and going west again. We  got back 
to Mauthausen. The place Œ later on discovered the place where I was supposed to be 

disposed of Œ was overran by the Reds. The Soviet army was there already. And Germans 
being so inditŒ I mean outrighŒ Langsam aber Sicher,
83
 slow and great and just exactly 
that way, no other way Œ took us back to the concentration camp.  
 
06:23:41 
 
We  came back with a group Œ big group of prisoners from prisons in Vienna and 
elsewhere, probably two or three, 400 of us
. There were tables ready, the registering 
tables. All the blockschreiŠblockschreibers
84
 were there, including my block secretary 
standing Œ sitting there at tables, you know they write your data, take your document if 
you have any and give you a number, give you a bracelet with your number and tell you 
where to go. So he was sitting there, he, ﬁStefan, come  on, come  on, come  on here.ﬂ So I 

went and I said, ﬁBujwid.ﬂ And he said, ﬁW
ell, welcome again. Great you made it Œ great 
you made it.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat do you mean great you made it?  I was supposed to be freed.ﬂ 

He said, ﬁYeah, you were going to himme l.ﬂ And there was a priest, Father Iwanski. 

Before I left, he listened to my confession, he gave me  absolution and he said, ﬁYou are 
be freed, with the next three or four days, you™ll be free. And pray for us.ﬂ So I ca Œ later 
on I talked to Father Iwanski, I said, ﬁYou son of a gun, what do you think it was?  Didn™t 

you know I was going to by hung? ﬂ ﬁWell, you know, I wanted to cheer you up. But I 
gave you absolution, so you will go straight to paradise.ﬂ So I, ﬁI probably will go to the 
deepest hell, what I Œ for all what I did so far.ﬂ Anyway, Mr. Bujwid, ﬁHere™s your 

number, here™s your bracelet, go to the showers and go to the barrack. You got Œ you got 
barrack 22, you™re going to my block.ﬂ And I looked and I said, ﬁI don™t want this damn 
number, this a zugang numbers, this is a new prisoner number. I want my number. I am a 

prominente.
85
ﬂ By that time I was a prominent prisoner. If you survive six months, you 
become prominent prisoner. And out of those 600 that I came with, in six months there 
were 13 of us left, only. So by Œ by the time Œ when you became prominente, you have

special consideration. You can even go to SS kitchen after the SS finish and get a dish of 
their own soup, with beans and pork in it. 
 
06:25:58 
 
Q: There was kind of a hierarchy in the camp?  
 
A: You becaŒ you became, you became person who counts. You became a prominent Œ a 
prominent prisoner, because you ma de it. And most of those who became functionaries in 
a camp, you know, if they didn™t go by killing people, they did it by surviving. So he 
said, ﬁShut up. You want be killed?  Go to the showers and go to your barrack.ﬂ So I put 

my arm in there, tucked my ears in, went in. My finery was stripped. My shoe Œ my 
beautiful boots even were taken. I was left with a belt and a pair of holzschuhe
86
 and my 
little bundle, which I stuck in a Œ in a holzschuh. Get out of the shower and was thrown 

prison strip Œ prisoner garb. Went back to the barrack boiling mad and Mr. Bujwid came 
and he said, ﬁWhat™s the matter with you, don™t you know any better?  You could get me 

killed and yourself killed.ﬂ Said, ﬁYes, but I™m not a prominente any more. Look at that 
damn number.ﬂ My Œ I Œ I will never forget my numbers. If you wake me up presently, in 
the mi ddle of the night, I will stand at attention and shout my number. ﬁHundert-vier,

ﬂ ﬁ104,222.ﬂ And the second one was like 40,000 up, it 
was, ﬁHundert zwei und zwanzig, zwei hundert drei and sechzig.

ﬂ ﬁ122,263.ﬂ So he 
said, ﬁYou know what you had in your documents?  You had ‚N and N.™ And you know

ﬂ It was spring

disperse like in a spring wind. So he said, ﬁNow, you are free.ﬂ We ll, I wasn™t free, but 
my being taken out to the Politische Abteilung ended. My seat healed. I didn™t get any 

more a beating from then on.  
 
Q: So this Œ 
 
A: I was completely different, new person. 
 
Q: You sort of assume d a new identity.

Q: We ll, you™re doing just fine. 
 
A: Well, I said forget it, I™m not sick or anything. I™m a tough old son of a gun. 
 
Q: They didn™t tattoo you?  
 
A: No. They did not tattoo in Mauthausen, no. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: OnlyAuschwitz. 
 
Q: JustAuschwitz. 
 
A: Yeah, only Auschwitz. 
 
Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We ™re outside 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is being conducted by Katie Davis and this is 
tape number seven. I wanted to ask you about the ma n you were just describing, who sort 
of had a position at the camp and who was giving you advice on your situation. Wa s he 

Polish? 
 
A: He was Polish. His name  was Bujwid. He was from a territory called Zmudz, which is 
biŒ Lithuania in Œ in northern Russia. It was a holy Polish Zmudz. The coat of arms was 
Saint Michael. And they were Poles from 11th century. He was a prisoner. By surviving 
the first six months, also by knowing German very well, he became a block secretary. 

Each block had a Blockältester, block leader, which was in most cases German criminal 
and a block secretary who knew German very well, could write and read very well. So he 
was it. And it was an important function, even though he didn™t cherish it because he had 

to lead Œ he had to call a lot of people to execution or to bunker or to injection or to gas 
chamber or to a Œ to go on a transport. That was his function Œ that™s how he survived. If 
he wasn™t there, some body else would have done it. He had to keep the numbers of all 

people who had to assist the Rapportführer.
90
 Every morning you Œ you lined up outside, 
the Rapportführer Œ SS ma n came and he counted you. Secretary wrote it down and gave 
it to him, he walked out. And a tally was made for the whole camp that had to count just 
right, nobody mi ssing. If anybody was mi ssing, they counted 10 times, until they found 

everybody. So this secretary was a Œ was the secretary of the barrack.

Q: And Œ and what did you think of him or people like that, who essentially were, I guess 
taking jobs, in a way, in the concentration camp?  
 
A: We ll, in most cases, we were appreciative, because if they were Polish, they could be of 
great help to us. Also, yoŒ they were not killers. Some  Kapos were killers. Kapo Œ Kapos 
were group Œ people who led groups of people to work and to exercise and to kill at will. 
But people who Œ who had functions like block leader, if he didn™t kill, he was all right 

and block secretary, most of them did not kill, they were all right. And there was a 
secretary over first quarantine, there was a Œ was a chief secretary of the whole Œ 
Führerschreiber,
91
 secretary of the whole camp. They had positions. The camp inside, ran 
itself. Let me  have a drink of water. 
 
07:03:42 
 
[Technical conversation] 
 
A: Well, I™m back from a trip. 
 
Q: You were asking about the, the guy who™s Œ The guy, okay. 
 
A: The guy, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. I think Œ I think actually, I think you answered that, soŒ 
 
A: Yes. So I was Œ I was back on his Œ in his barrackŒ 
 
Q: Oh right, okay. 
 
A: And that was a time that evacuations started comi ng from the east. When the eastern 
fr ont approached, they would evacuate camps and push the prisoners in, killing most 
along the way. Those who could not walk would be killed and those who could walk. So 
Mauthausen became greatly overcrowded. So, like my barrack, instead of having 120 

people, had 700. Half of the people slept inside, sitting one again Œ against each other, for 
half a night and then they would get out of a window and the people who are standing 
outdoors, would get in at 12 o™clock and sit on the floor to be warm and to sleep until 

morning.

A: Oh, of course, yes. And it was a time when I Œ when I me t Victor Frankl. You heard of 
Victor Frankl?  He was a Jew fr
om Vienna. He just died about a year ago, he was in his 
upper 90™s. He was a great ma n, he was a psychoanalyst. If you ever see a little book 
called my Œ 
Man™s Search for Meaning
, it was translated into English, ma ny of his books 
were translated, he was a psychoanalyst. And he Œ when he came to Mauthausen, I don™t 
know if Œ if he came from Auschwitz or elsewher
e, he was just on his last leg. He lost his 
spoon, he lost his dish and with those two, you were dead. But he had a big bundle of 
papers. And we me t, he some how plopped next to me  and Œ and he said, ﬁNu, who are 
you? ﬂ ﬁOh, I am Polish.ﬂ ﬁOh, I am Jew from Vienna. And what do you do in your life? ﬂ 
I said, ﬁI did nothing, I was a student and I was doing some little work after that Œ before 

the Germans caught me. What did you do? ﬂ ﬁWell, I was a doctor and I™m a doctor of 
psychology.ﬂ And I said, ﬁWhere™s your spoon? ﬂ ﬁOh, I lost it.ﬂ ﬁWhere™s your dish? ﬂ 
ﬁOh, I lost it.ﬂ I said, ﬁMan, you dead, because you won™t get your soup, you won™t get 

anything to eat with.ﬂ And if you try to catch some  Œ some  servers would give it into your 
hat, but most of them wouldn™t. They would just take you aside and kill you. Anyway, 
found him soup spoon and found him dish and we became friends. And he was great. For 

next few days we just talked and every time we felt bad, it was just Œ end was comi ng, 
you know, people are being taken to gas chamber and places. He™s a Œ he said, ﬁOh, sit 
down here, let™s talk.ﬂ So we talk blue str
eak and we got cheered up. He developed a Œ a 
special kind of psychotherapy call Œ called logotherapy. And he™s went talking on Œ on Œ 
talking tours through United States many times. One time he came in 1970™s, late 70™s 
and we couldn™t get together, but I phoned him 
at Coffman Union at the University here 
and he called me  back at work and then he talk Œ we Œ he phoned at night and we talked 
for about three hours, from about 12 until 3:30. Said, ﬁWell, I got to go, my train is Œ my 
plane is leaving shortly.ﬂ So we said, ﬁA
uf wiedersehenﬂ and then  Œ anyway, he 
survived, but when Œ I never thought he would ma ke it, but he did. He stayed in 
Mauthausen to the very Œ time of liberation. But, my case, again, I was fished out after a 
few Œ in a few days after the great crowds came and I was transported to Gusen Zwei, 

which was a walking distance. Gusen Eins
92
 was about two mi Œ two kilome ters, Gusen 
Zwei was about five kilome ters, so we walk
ed. There were about 5,000 of us walked that 
day. We were gather at the nightfall. We were Œ our clothes was taken, only belt and 

shoes were left on us. Our clothes was taken to be disinfected. We  went to showers, 

which were cold at that time. We were put outside and we stayed until about four a.m. I 
was still quite nimble and quite healthy. I got in the mi ddle of a group. My head kind of 
froze, but at morning we found about 500 people who were dead, out of 5,000. This is 

only 10 percent. 
 
07:09:16 
 
Q: But– tell us what that was like to Œ to spend the night and have people dropping around 
you, dying.

 Gusen I

A: Yes, well, you become  numb. You become  cold, you becoŒ you hurt. Then all of a 
sudden you become  numb, you don™t hurt any more. You™re not even cold any more. You 
become  kind of a frozen stick. And Gusen Zwei was the worst camp you ever heard of. 
Normally, it had 50,000 prisoners and by the end of a week would be 45,000. Every week 

5,000 prisoners came, some time 10,000. And it never went above 50. Never went about 
40. In a week would be 40. About Œ attrition ration was about 20 percent a week. Was a 
horrible work, we worked digging tunnels under mountain. The tunnels were builŒ dug 

especially to put armament industries in them. They already built tanks. They built 
Messerschmitt Œ Messerschmitt planes. And I think they built also rocket planes that they 
used Œ I mean, the Vau-Eins,
93
 Vau-Eins, Vau-Zwei,
94
 to bomb England. But I™m not sure 
of that. But I knew they built Messerschmitts. But I was on a crew that was digging the 
tunnel, digging with a Œ straight ahead of you, in a kind of a softish stone, with a air drill. 
And a person as strong as he is, or he is, c
ould stand about four days. After four days you 
broke down. Well, I stood it for about seven days and I was given a shovel to shovel 
because I couldn™t lift it any more. And I had a Yugoslavian friend Œ Janko Œ Janko, I 
can™t remember his last name. He lasted 27 days drilling. The drill weighed probably 35 - 

40, ma ybe 50 pounds, straight into the wall, drilling. Then he dropped dead. Just dropped 
the drill and dropped. By the time we turn him over, he was dead. Yeah, he was a Œ 
Yugoslavians and especially Albanian. Albanian people are the tough son of a guns. 

Albanian ma n can swear for 15 mi nutes and never repeat himself. And if you translate 
some of the swearing, your hair will stand on end. They™re tougher than Polacks, they™re 
tougher than Russians. Even tougher than Yugoslavians. 
 
07:12:10 
 
Q: What were they giving you to eat at this point?  Were you gettingŒ 
 
A: We  had cup Œ we got cup of tea, it was birch leaves, or whatever it was, in the morning, 
nothing else. Sometime there was some milk. It was like a Œ like a cereal, boiled. Like 
ma ybe a handful of cereal to 10 gallons of water. It was slightly sweetish, I think they 
had some  Œ beet ma rmalade mi xed in it, and a cup of tea. At noon, you got a half a gallon 

of soup that had practically nothing in it and a small slice of bread. At night you got a 
pound of bread for either seven or eight or 10 
people and a Œ another cup of tea. It was 
supposed to be 800 calories, but by the time it did get to you, it was no more than about 
four or 500. One does Œ if one did not
 organize, one did not last long. 
 
Q: What Œ what do you mean by that?  
 
A: I was lucky. I had a Russian friend who was a thief. He can steal anything out of 
anyplace. When the allotment of cigarettes came to a block to be given to the 
functionaries and it was parceled out, he would always steal of Œ steal a carton of

cigarettes and nobody ever could catch him. He was a Rostovskiy urka.
95
 He was a 
specialist from Rostov. He said, ﬁWhen I was 10 years old, Ya khodil po karmenam,
96
 I 
walked in Œ he walked into people™s  pockets.ﬂ He was a pickpocket. He could steal 
anything off anybody. So he shared his cigarettes with me . Cigarette were the high, hard 
currency. For one-fourth of a cigarette, you got portion of bread. For one-eighth of a 

cigarette, you got a dish of soup. So when I had an access to some thing, I shared with 
him. To ma ke it short, I had a SS ma n who didn™t like me , who beat me  frequently. He 
was a beautiful, young, tall, blonde beast and he had a German Shepherd, young German 

Shepherd with him. So one time, I got the shŒ German Shepherd in a dark tunnel and of 
course I dispose of him, I skinned him. I had him baked in a baŒ in the smithy, because I 
that time was Œ I was a Œ a Läufer,
97
 I was a runner. I was running with the drills to the 
smithy and back, you know, carrying them back and forth to be sharpened and to be 
brought back. So I gave the smith one-fourth of a dog, he baked it for me . Then I shared 
another quarter with the people who worked 
with me  and a half of the dog, I brought to 
the camp and that three or four of us lived high on the dog for about a week and a half. 
Oh, that was an enormous shot in the arm. Course my Russian friend liked the dog so 
much, he said, ﬁStepka, get another one. Get another one.ﬂ I said, ﬁSorry, I cannot catch 

and old German Shepherd, this was a young, stupid German Shepherd.ﬂ  
 
07:15:41 
 
Q: I see. So, to survive, you couldn™t just accept what they gave you, you had to find that 
extraŒ 
 
A: You had to organize, you had to trade. When I was in Mauthausen, if I worked Œ when I 
worked on a Kanadakomma ndo, sorting the goods, I was able to scrounge a lot of 
jewelry, came to the barrack or Œ got a bundle of American dollars. I could get a beautiful 
bottle of booze for 500 dollars. Or I could get a big, five pound sausage for 500 dollars. 

And my friends and Œ and Œ and Œ and colleagues, we live high on the hog. 
 
07:16:22 
 
Q: Now, at this time, in this camp that you were at, where you were doing the tunnel 
drilling, were people being taken away and executed or gassed at this camp?  
 
A: We  had a gas chamber, but I Œ no, there was a gas chamber in Gusen One, but not Gusen 
Zwei. But the mortality ratio was so enormous that Œ that nothing else was necessary. Of 
course the Kapos killed their portion of people every day. We went to camp, I mean went 
to work Œ on the way home we carried five, six, 10 - 15 - 20 people out of a hundred. 

Carried them because they were killed at the job. Some  dropped dead but most of them

were killed by the Kapo. Kapo would get a cigarette for every person he killed. If he 
were a heavy smoker, he killed a lot of people. Also, there was a Krankenhaus, there was 
a hospital and if you went to Krankenhaus, never came back, of course Œ but some  people 
did. So from time to time, they would have a Œ a Krankenhaus had to be disinfected. So 

they would take the people from a Krankenhaus and make them walk across the railroad 
tracks to another barrack that was empty, kind of a temporary Krankenhaus and keep 
them there, and there would be a line of Kapos lined up on each side of the group 

walking. Anybody who would walk, they ran a gauntlet. They had ax handles on Œ or two 
by fours, and anybody who did not run, was killed. So I reme mber once in the first of 
February, 1945, they killed that night, 400 si
ck people out of 700, about 300 only ma de 
it, could run. The rest were killed. I had a friend at that time, he was a Polish 
mountaineer. He was a tough son of a Œ he was just wiry, he was strong. He was 
everything. Anyway, he got sick or he Œ ma ybe he ma linger. So he was sent to the 

hospital. He went to hospital, couple nights later comes a Kapo from a hospital and say Œ 
calls my number, so I answer him, and said, ﬁYou have a friend in the hospital.ﬂ ﬁYes, I 
have a friend in the hospital.ﬂ ﬁHis Œ his name is Janko the Góral,
98
 ﬁJohn Œ little Johnny, 
the mountaineer.ﬂ ﬁYes.ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ he said, ﬁthat window, so he wants you to come  and 
see him at that window.ﬂ So at night I sneaked in Œ that was not allowed. To get out of a 
barrack, going get killed. So I went and I knocked the window, he opened it up and, ﬁOh, 

Stefan, come  tomorrow and bring me  a big jug of water. I™m so thirsty, there™s not 
enough water here. Here.ﬂ So he gave me a little bundle. I came back, there were about 
seven portions of bread. It was a fortune. Eating an extra portion a day, keep you alive 

and up your spirit for at least a week, maybe 14 days. So I brought him some water next 
day and I said, ﬁJanko, where did you get all that bread? ﬂ ﬁWell, you know, those damn 
Muselmans
99
.ﬂ Muselmans was a name  for people who were on their last foot. You 
know, they just lay there, they can™t eat, they hold their bread. So when the 
Fliegeralarm
100
 come s, you know, night, when the lights are out and planes are flying Œ 
lights are all Œ all the lights are off, he just went from bed to bed and swiped the bread 

and lived high on the hog.  
 
07:20:34 
 
And I said, ﬁJanko, but this is un-Christian.ﬂ ﬁThey are going to die anyway. I™m not 
going to Œ I Œ I™m not killing them, but they can™t eat. They have bunches of bread sitting 
there, they just can™t eat.ﬂ So we both Œ and all my friends in the barrack, lived high on 
the hog. And Janko came back, got out of a baŒ of a hospital, came back to the barrack 

and he was given three days of convalescence. He was staying in the barrack, did not 
have to go to work. And the Kapo, day Kapo in the barrack, ask him to do some thing and 
Janko said, ﬁYou so and so, get away from me . I™m convalescing, I™m sick.ﬂ So the ma n

took his tool and beat Janko to death. I came at
 night and one of our friends said, ﬁYour 
friend is there.ﬂ There was a Œ you know, there was a big, high stone wall between each 
barrack and next barrack. And we lined up, you know laid down, it was 10 - 20 - 50 
people a day who were dying. So I went. Yes, Janko was still there, laying, his head 

bashed in. So I did have his address. I wrote to his family after the war and his sister 
answered and she said, ﬁWell, my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because 
he argued with her, so he volunteered and we
nt to work in Germany and he got himself 
charge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp. And please tell me, did he have a 
nice casket?  How was he buried, did he have a priest? ﬂ  Janko, with probably 500 others, 
next day, was dumped into big wagon, that about 50 prisoners pushed and pulled. They 

just had big sides and their wheels were just like the Conestoga wagons in America there, 
but bigger. And they pushed and pulled to the first Gusen Eins, where the crematorium 
was. Gusen Zwei did not have a crematorium, so that the bodies, probably four or 500 a 

day, some time ma ybe 1,000 a day were wheeled to Gusen Eins to be cremated. 
 
07:23:07 
 
Q: Were there times when you were afraid?  
 
A: Not really. Became like Œ became Œ it became a normal life. It became a very normal life. 
You watched not to cross a line, you watched not to overstep your Œ your Œ your territory. 
You watched. I mean you had to have eyes back there and side here and forward, even 
down below. If you Œ if you saw a SS ma n comi ng, you didn™t step off the sidewalk, why, 

he just could kill you. If you didn™t step off the sidewalk and take your hat off and clap it 
again-against your leg and stood at attention, you could get killed. If he didn™t like your 
looks, he could just take a gun and shoot you or else beat you that you would not survive. 

On and on and on, and if you did ma ke it, it™s just good luck, holy providence and a good 
combination of both of them. 
 
Q: So it™s February or March of 1945, are Œ ar
e what Œ are you getting any information from 
the rest of the world?  Do you have any sense Œ 
 
A: None. None whatsoever. We ll, there were rumors. You know rumors, like in American 
army rumors or any place where a lot of people, rumors. There were some  people who 

listened to radios in a camp, but they shared their information very sparingly. We knew 
what was going on. The rumors told that Americans landed. The Russians are comi ng. 

We ll, of course you know, all those prisoners comi ng from the east, consequently the 
front line is comi ng. The Germans are being killed by zillions. Well, great. We hope they 
will all geŒ will get it. The Œ then we heard, when the Poles landed in Holland, you know 

the Polish parachuters, whole brigade and couple American brigades landed in Holland, 
we heard those rumors and it was the gospel truth of course, you could not Œ I mean, if 
you said, ﬁNo, it™s not true,ﬂ some body could kill you, probably. Said, ﬁYou defeatist, 

what do you mean it™s not true?  Honest, it™s gospel truth.ﬂ

Q: Did you ma ke good friends there, or Œ 
 
A: Quite a few. But they didn™t last very long. Either they got transferred or got killed. Most 
of them got killed. Only two people that I know survived Gusen Zwei. One was a priest, 
one was unfinished priest. Father Iwanski and Father Bruno. Father Iwanski survived. He 
survived Gusen, which was not easy to survive. He ended in Canada. I corresponded with 

him. He™s dead for last 10 - 15 years. He was an old ma n that time. You know, he was in 
his 40™s, he was old, old ma n. When he came to camp, said ﬁHey, how are Œ old are 
you? ﬂ ﬁOh, I™m 29 - 30 - 32.ﬂ ﬁOh my God, you old. Week, two weeks, you are gone.ﬂ 

You were supposed to be 17 - 18 - 19, you had a chance. If you were over 30, you were 
an old ma n. Father Iwanski was over 40. He was an old ma n. Father Bruno was an 
unfinished priest, he was Œ we call him unfinished priest. Nie skonczony ksiadz.
101
  He 
was still in a semi nary. He eventually became a priest and he went back to Poland. I 
understand he was executed by the Communists. 
 
07:27:01 
 
Q: Did the priests hold any kind of religious services, or Œ 
 
A: Verysecretly. 
 
Q: Œ counsel you, or Œ 
 
A: Very Œ they talked to us.  
 
Q: Theytalked? 
 
A: When I went on my little trip, Father Iwanski came to talk to me, he was still in 
Mauthausen and he talked to me  and he blessed me  and he listened to my confession. 

Later on I Œ I felt like killing him. 
 
Q: Why?  
 
A: We ll, I said, ﬁYou should have warned me .ﬂ ﬁWarned you?  What do Œ would it do?  I 
have Œ I wanted you to feel good for next two or three days.ﬂ 
 
Q: But you would have liked to have known?  
 
A: I would have liked to have  known, yes. If I would have known, I Œ I mi ght have ma de a 
greater effort Œ there wasn™t much chance, but I Œ I mi ght have tried. I probably would 

have killed myselŒ got killed for it, but I would have known I didn™t go meekly. And Œ

08:00:10 
 
Q: Okay. This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We  are outside of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape 
number eight. 
 
A: Oh my God, eight?  He is wasting eight tapes.  
 
Q: Not wasting. This is just Œ I guess it™s just sort of an observation, that you were saying 
you would have liked to have known, that one time when you were being taken off, to 

possibly Œ well, the plan was to hang you. But so much of the war years, you had no idea 
what was going to happen next. 
 
A: No, I didn™t. As I said, I was resigned. I expected not to live to be 18 or 20 or 19 or 20, 
but I did. And I was very prayerfully, thankful for each day that I lived and tomorrow 
will take care of itself. Even at bedtimes, when I expected to be Œ to be taken to the little 
room to be injected Œ I knew it was comi ng, but still I said, ﬁWell, I™m still alive today. 

Tomorrow will take care of itself.ﬂ Especially, I mean I felt very bad one time. There was 
a little boy, his name  was Henry. He said he was 14, but he looked like he was nine. He 
was a Œ he was a Polish worker, working in Germany, in a factory. Some body put sand in 

a Œ in a motor. Motor got destroyed, he was blamed for it, sabotage. Sent to Mauthausen. 
He lived, for a time, in block 22. Then he was called. And he was Œ he was just like a 
tiny, little bird. He was so skinny, he was so mi serable. He just looked like a Œ like a Œ 

like will of a wisp. And Mr. Bujwid wanted greatly Œ to help him. So when he Œ 
execution time came, Mr. Bujwid went to the Œ camp secretary went to Gestapo office 
and begged for him, one day. So they postpone it. And the next day Œ next day he came  

his face was bitten up and swollen. He came Œ  
 
08:02:40 
 
Q: Who™sthis? 
 
A: Our secretary. He went next day again and 
again he had welts on his back and his face 
was beaten some  more. So the fourth day, a list came Œ Läufer came running. Läufer was 
the runner, you know, as I Œ pretty young boys were runners, Läufers. They ran between 
the camps and delivered messages. So Läufer came with a list and Œ and said, ﬁMr. 

Bujwid,ﬂ I mean, ﬁHerr Bujwid.
102
 Exekution eintreten, Exekution eintreten.
103
 Roll up 
with execution.ﬂ So Mr. Bujwid came to barrack and read the list and I was sure I was 
going to be on the list and the little boy was on the list. And he walked out into the front

and they got lined up and the Blockältester, Max, the German criminal who was the block 
leader, led them out–. And it was so, so funny, Mr. Bujwid talked with that little Henry. 
Oh, they talk blue streak. ﬁBecause we both are from the holy Zmudz.ﬂ Because the little 
boy was from the same  territory that Mr. Bujwid was. They say, ﬁWe™re holy people, we 

believe in God, we hate the damn Communists. We  hate those Germans even more 
because they™re ungodly creatures. And we are going to survive for ever and ever and 
ever.ﬂ And the last day, before Henry went to be killed, he said, ﬁMr. Bujwid, thank 

you.ﬂ Yeah, he, he knew what was comi ng.  
 
08:05:06 
 
Anyway, that was still in Mauthausen and that was I waŒ then I waŒ on our way in Œ 

Gusen Zwei and of course, it Œ I heard it later on, but it was a good story. A Swedish Red 
Cross person, whose name  nobody ever found, came to speak to the comma nder, General 
Pohl,
104
 P-o-h-l. And he came to talk to him and General Pohl was complaining, he said, 
ﬁSee here,ﬂ was a telegram or was a letter. ﬁI have an befehl
105
 here,ﬂ I have an order, ﬁto 
lead all these people I have left here, about 42,000, into the tunnel. The ends of the 
tunnels are already mi ned to be dynamited and those people will suffocate there, within 
in probably one, two hours.ﬂ He said, ﬁIf it 
was only telephone order, I probably could 
escape not doing it, but is a befehl, it™s a telegram, I had to sign for it. What I am going to 
do? ﬂ He was not Œ he was not a very bad person, that ma n was. Matter of fact, he had a 
case in court later on and some  of us testified for him. Anyway, when this man left his 

office, the document disappeared. The ma n Œ and the general was diverted some what Œ 
the ma n swiped it. He borrowed a bicycle from a German guard, then he borrowed a 
horse. And the American front line was just beyond Linz. It was probably 30 - 35 - 40 

miles. He went across the whole front line on a horse, then Œ he in tie and suit. Why the 
German GesŒ SS didn™t kill him, I don™t have an idea. Did he talked to somebody, I don™t 
have an idea. Did he identify himself, I don™t have an idea. He got across, he got as far as 

General Patton
106
 headquarters. And nobody wanted to talk to him, so he bothered 
everybody there and eventually somebody did talk to him. So he mentioned that, he 
described it. So they said, ﬁOkay, come on in, come on in.ﬂ They let him talk to assistant 
to Patton. And then Patton came and asked a few questions. And Patton sent five 

American tanks. They broke across the front line, they went and went and went. They 
came to Gusen Zwei, they took few potshots at the guard towers. The SS people 
surrendered. They left tank, I think about five soldiers, to guard those 800 SS, who are 

herded into Œ into Œ into a big kind of a barn. And the rest of us, who were just barely 
moving, because we haven™t gotten anything to eat about four days and my case, I was 
flat on my back. I couldn™t even turn over. Then the four tanks went to Mauthausen, five 

more miles and surŒ and get around, too few Œ took few potshots at the guard towers.

 The interviewee later corrected this name to Max Pausch, Kommandant of Gusen II.

3,000 SS people surrendered and there was bedlam in Mauthausen. It was not much of a 
bedlam in Gusen Zwei because most of us were just about done for. 
 
08:09:07 
 
Q: Take us back a little bit Œ waŒ what was going on the last few days that you had stopped 
getting food?  
 
A: They told us there was no food. ﬁWe cannot give you anything because there isn™t any.ﬂ 
Well, it turned out, that the warehouses were full of bread and the bread was Œ after we 
found it after a few days after liberation, it was all moldy by then. There was probably 
two, three, four, five tons of bread. They ju
st probably tried to starve us to death. And 

ma ny did. Many did. We  had an enormous ditch dug out between the Gusen Eins and 
Gusen Zwei by American bulldozers, army bulldozers. Just an enormous ditch. And they 
took all the Germans from the countryside, with horses and carts and wheelbarrows and 

all and they came and picked up all the people, washed up everybody and laid them 
evenly, not just dumped them, but laid them evenly in a Œ in that grave. There are about 
18,000 people buried there. And those were the dead for last four or five days, when the 

crematorium did not work. 
 
Q: 18,000?  
 
A: About 17 - 18,000. An enormous, enormous Œ kind of almost like a Œ like a Œ like a 
riverbank built up high. 
 
Q: Did the Germans know that the Americans were comi ng?  
 
A: Well, they expected Œ they, they all knew the front was nearby, but they expect it to be 
still fighting there for quite sometime, but this Œ they just broke through. They said, ﬁOh 
my God, the armi es are comi ng. ﬁAme rikaner, Amerikaner Œ run!ﬂ And the SS of course, 
just surrendered and the Commander Ziereis
107
 was a horrible ma n Œ of Mauthausen. He 
was Œ people testified and Œ against him and he was hanged, later on. But General Pohl of 
MauŒ of Gusen Zwei, was exonerated. 
 
Q: Think back to that day and Œ you said you were laying in bed, but did Œ what did it sound 
like when the Americans Œ 
 
A: It was kind of a bedlam Œ it was a bedlam and it was a Œ Americans really came, you 
know Œ really came. It was about two days later that the front moved, Americans came. 

They just came in, walking around. Taking lot of pictures and they came  to my Œ to my 
barrack and they looked up and Œ and one of them spoke German, ﬁKomme n Sie da,

108
ﬂ And I said, ﬁI can™t move. I can™t even turn over.ﬂ ﬁJa, wir helfen 
dich Œ wir helfen Œ wir helfen dich.
109
ﬂ We™ll help you. Came with a stretcher and a 
couple people and they pull me  off. They lay me  in a stretcher and some body came with a 
pail of water, they washed me  off. I was Œ I was shitty and Œ and stinking, and all that and 
they covered me  up with a German army overcoat. Took me  to Gusen Eins and there was 

a little hospital made there and were given little milk Œ milk with Œ mi xed with water and 
kind of a gruel, that you give to babies, fo
r a few days. Eventually, we started eating 
food. And people who were in Œ who got hold of a solid food, like American were tossing 
cans of Spam Œ and Spam was the heavenly food. Oh my God. Spam was it. I still can 
close my eyes and I can taste that beautiful American Spam. So some body would eat it, 
would not share it with some body else and he would die, immediately, on the spot. Could 

not Œ could not take it. 
 
08:13:15 
 
Q: So you were pretty sick. What was the r
eaction of the Americans who saw you Œ who ca 
Œ who came by your bunk and saw you?  
 
A: We ll, there were so ma ny of us, they were just flabbergasted. They kept us there and they 
took us some , on Œ in trucks, to hospital in Bamberg, which was couple hundred miles 
west, into West Germany. And I was in a Städtischer Hospital,
110
 the state hospital for 
about four, five, six months there. I had Œ well, I was down to 72 pounds, had a Œ I had a 

bad case of tuberculosis. And my lungs were 
collecting liquid, especially my left lung. So 
I got shots. I got shots, it was the 10 cubic centimeters lime Œ lime shots. Know lime, like 

the Œ used for building?  Calcium Œ calcium shots. Calcium shots. And when you get the 
shot, you get hot from your tip of your toe Œ fingers to tippy toes and to your head, you 
just get pleasantly hot. And that was supposed to shŒ to dry up that liquid in your lungs. 

And after a few weeks, when a nurse was comi ng with a needle, my veins went south. 
She would jab and jab and jab and she could not find a vein. She said, ﬁJust don™t look 
when I come . I don™t want you to see, because your veins disappear.ﬂ My both arms were 

just like Œ like I was a heavy addict to God knows what. But it didn™t dry it. It didn™t dry, 
they had to ma ke a puncture in the back and pump it out. And they couldn™t put me  
under, because I would never wake up. So two big me n, just like those two, big clunks 

held me  and the doctor went back and he ma de Œ punctured my back and he pumped, oh 
probably gallon and a half of horrible liquid. And he said Œ the doctor said, ﬁWell, if 
you™re lucky, this is it. If you™re not lucky, you have to pump it every six months for the 

rest of your days. Of course, if are still unlucky, you die of TB, well, you™ll be dead.ﬂ I 
was lucky. I didn™t die of TB and I did not have to ever have it pumped again, except that 
I have two big stones on the bottom of my lungs, because the calcium goes all the 

organism and collects in your lungs and settles on the bottom. Occasionally when I have

cold, when I cough, little grainy stuff, I do cough out. Doesn™t bother me  any. Except I go 
to x-ray. When I first came to x-ray, he says, the doctor Œ technician looked, call the 
doctor and doctor said, ﬁWhat is that? ﬂ And I said, ﬁWhat is what? ﬂ ﬁWhat is that on 
bottom of your lungs? ﬂ  I said, ﬁCalcium.ﬂ ﬁCalcium?  How come  calcium? ﬂ  Said, ﬁWell, I 

was given about 310 cubic centimeters as injections of calcium to dry up my wet 
pleurisy, they called it, Pleuritism Exudative
111
 in Latin Œ my wet pleurisy.ﬂ ﬁOh, they 
did that? ﬂ  ﬁYes, they did that.ﬂ ﬁDid it dry out? ﬂ  ﬁNo.ﬂ 
 
08:17:00 
 
Q: Did you feel Œ I mean, could you comprehend that the war is over?  Did you feel safe 
again?  
 
A:  I fel t  safe. 
 
Q: Did you feel like it was really over?  
 
A: And I felt safe and I felt on the top of a cloud. It™s unbelievable, but when you have 
nothing, you know, you are dirty, you are starvi ng, you have completely nothing and you 

are in prison, the freedom is so sweet. When we went to work, there was a train going 
over the viaduct and you saw the German people standing in the windows and smiling, 

you know. We ll dressed, well-fed, just smiling, you said, ﬁOh my God, how free those 
people are.ﬂ They were not, I mean, they were under Nazis men, all that, but ﬁhow free 
these people are.ﬂ And frequently when you are in a life, you are quite well off 

some times and oh, my God, you know how ma ny people commit suicide because being 
unhappy temporarily. Nobody ever committed suicide there. He was Muselman, he went 
to gas tomorrow morning, he did not commit suiŒ suicide today. Well, there were 

incidents where people went against the wire and got themselves elec-electrocuted. But 
you never became despondent. You also Œ you n Œ you need that Œ you e Œ never caught a 
cold. I had never seen a person in Siberia Œ I have never seen a person in a concentration 

camp to catch a cold. Nobody ever caught the common cold, ever. They are just too 
tough to catch a cold. When you get to be a civilian, you become sissy, you catch any 
cold that comes along. 
 
Q: Now, when you got out, were you able to contact your family at all?  
 
A: No. For about six months I couldn™t. 
 
Q: Whynot?  
 
A: There was no connection.

A: No correspondence, nothing, between We st Germany and Poland, they were damn 
Soviets on the way. About six months later, I registered with the Swedish Red Cross and

on, they took us to Bamberg, to a real hospital. It was a good, old German hospital and Œ 
 
Q: And how did you feel about being treated by Germans?  
 
A: Great. The Schwesters
112
 Œ I mean all people who took care of you are nuns. The 
Schwesters are all nuns. All nurses in Germany at that time were nuns. There some nurse 
helper Œ nurse helpers who were ladies, women, civilian girls, but all German nurses 
were Schwesters. Oh yeah, then we had some great Schwesters. I still have a rosary that 

one gave me. Yeah, Sister Urszula gave me rosary, I still have it. 
 
08:20:33 
 
Q: So when was it determined that you would need to go for further rest?  
 
A: Well, after being in the hospital, they said, ﬁWell, you are not well to go into a camp, you 
have to go to sanatorium because your tuberculosis Œ it™s not spreaded Œ spreading, it™s 
arresting Œ it™s arrested, but you have to have rest.ﬂ So I went to Erholungsheim

home, which is a beautiful Schloß
114
 on a top of a mount Œ on the top Œ top of a hill, next 
to forest, with a big garden. And it was a Schloß, it was a castle that belonged to a 
German Jewish family. They had a David Œ David star in their Œ in their coat of arms. 
When the Hitler™s came, they all were arrested and packed to concentration camps and I 

understand never came back. 
 
Q: So what was it like when you got there?  
 
A: Well, we were assigned rooms Œ either one or two people to a room, you stayed a lot in 
bed. The food was quite good, provided by the German Œ by the Germans and Œ and 
Swiss Cross and American army, mostly. We ™d get American PX packages, with a little 
canned food and a beautiful piece of chocolate. I was crazy about chocolate. When I got 

my package, there was probably about four ounces of chocolate, I inhaled it. One time 
the chocolate was moldy in those packages, so I traded with everybody who want to 
dispose of it. I traded everything I had Œ I had Œ oh my God, I don™t know how ma ny 

blocks of chocolate I had Œ I ate myself sick. For next six weeks, I couldn™t look 
chocolate in the face. It was very moldy. The German doctor Œ actually it was a French 
lady doctor, she thought I was get blood Œ I mean food poisoning, she hovered over me 

constantly. It was a beautiful, little French girl. I almost, I almost married her. Yeah, she 
Œ we, we became very friendly and she took me  to see her family, we drove all the way to 
Versailles, stay there, came back. Of course nothing came out of it, I was just a 

dilapidated little old prisoner and she was a beautiful young lady, just out of medical 
school. But was great when it lasted. Oh, she was fun to be with. 
 
08:23:09 
 
Q: Boy, it sounds like you were starting to begin to take joy in normal things like Œ 
 
A: We ll, of course Œ 
 
Q: Œ chocolate and dating and Œ 
 
A: Of course, I me  Œ I mean every day was a new day and you are free. You are not going to 
get to be Œ get your Œ shot or go to a gas chamber. In Mauthausen, every 10 days, one 

block was gassed. You went to showers, you went in tiptoe Œ you went to showers every 
10 days. You went tiptoeing, your whole block, you know, 400 - 600 people Œ and there 

was a deathly silence. You could not h
ear people breathe. And everybody was watching 
the shower heads. You got a little piece of soap. When the water came, it was a bedlam. 
Jumping, yelling, shouting, laughing, hugging one another, because some time, instead of 

the water, those little red fl aps came open, Zyklon B
115
 poured in Œ those little blue

granules poured in, by gallons. Then your goose was cooked. Seventeen mi nutes, you 
were done for. 
 
Q: So you knew what happened in Œ in Œ I mean it was no secret at that point?  
 
A: Oh no, that was no secret.  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: When you went Œ and you never know which Œ you never knew which barrack was going 
to happen to. So you went Œ you apprehensive, when you got out, you say, ﬁWhee, I™m 
going to live next 10 days. At least next 10 days.ﬂ 
 
Q: And you told me  before that some times you were forced to actually clean up after that. 
 
A: Yes. Yes, I was under special Œ special barrack, so when they needed extra help when 
extra Œ lot of people came, they took a crew of 10 - 20 - 50 people and we had to go 

transport the bodies to the cool chamber. The cool chamber, it was kind of a underground 
tunnel and a little push railroad. We loaded up the bodies on the top of this little flatcars 

and got into crematorium Œ in the cool chamber next to it. The cool chamber too Œ could 
take about 2,000 people Œ bodies. Because sometime they couldn™t catch up, burning. 
 
Q: I mean how do you Œ what do you say to yourself to ma ke yourself do some thing like 
that? 
 
A: We ll, you went willingly, you got an extra bowl of soup. You abhorred it, but you went. 
You got big dish of SS soup. Peas or beans with pork in it. Oh my God, that was a 

heaven. As I said, your life became every day life Œ norma l, every day life. And whatever 
happened was normal for that time and place.  
 
08:26:15 
 
Q: In the first few days of your liberation, think 
about what were the things that Œ that were 
norma lly norma l, but you weren™t used to any more. Did you have any experiences, you 
know that Œ 
 
A: It was just Œ it was just like being a cloud 
nine. Laying in a clean bed and being clean and 
being Œ people come  and feed you. An American would come  and stand by my bed. And 

he said, ﬁYou cannot eat, can you? ﬂ ﬁWell, I can, kind of.ﬂ So he would take a spoon–. 
Yes, it was a great feeling.

Tape #9
 
 
09:00:07 
 
Q: It is April 8, 1998. We™re outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is being 
conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number nine. So you™re in the sanatorium and 
you™re beginning to get your strength back. 
What kind of thoughts are you having about 
your future?  
 
A: Not much of it. By the time I became well, I knew that Poland became Communist and 
the part of the Polish underground I was in was fighting both the Germans and the 

Communists. As we said, ﬁThey are comi ng, who do you shoot first? ﬂ We  said, ﬁPleasure 
before duty, shoot the Russians first.ﬂ And I knew they were looking for me . I felt they 

were looking for me . I discover later on they were. Out of the original 17 Œ 20, five of us 
survived. I was arrested by the Germans and was sent away. The four boys survived. 
About a year later, they were asked to a big party by the local Russian army people, 

because they discovered what we did and especially what we did for them. They had a 
big party. They drank and ate for three days and three nights, they were given Stalin 
Cross. They were given Pobieda Medal,
116
 Russian victory me dal. They were given 
Polish Virtuti Militari, third class. They were given 17,000 rubles each. And fourth day, 
were packed on a Œ put on a train and sent to Siberia. Said, ﬁPeople like you, we 
appreciate what you did for us, but we don™t wa
nt you now here.ﬂ And two of those four 
boys Œ were two that were of Œ with me  from the very beginning. From the very Œ my 
first seven Œ 17 and there was Icek number one, Icek number two. Isaac number one, 
Isaac number two. They were both Jewish boys. And they led a charme d life. I knew I 

was probably God™s chosen, ma ybe son of God Œ some time I felt I was God, almost. 
Because everybody else killed right and left, mutilated, I am still alive. I got few Œ hit 
few times, but it was nothing. But I always look at those two and said, ﬁMy Œ you two are 

freaks. How come  you still alive? ﬂ ﬁWell, if you want to kill us, go ahead.ﬂ They never 
came back. The other two came back from Soviet Russia, these two never came back. 
 
09:03:10 
 
Q: Now, I didn™t know that two of the boys in your unit were Jewish. 
 
A: Yes, they were Jewish, yes. 
 
Q: Interesting.

A: We  had probably more who did not identify themselves. And I reme mber some  of the 
name s of people. But none of our name s were name s. We  did not tell our own name s. My 
c Œ my name  was not Czyzewski, my  name  was Grot.
117
 
 
Q: Can you spell that?  
 
A: G-r-o-t. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Spearpoint. 
 
Q: Cause I had read in some  of the history books, that some  of the Polish underground didn™t 
want to fight with the Jewish underground.  
 
A: Many didn™t Œ some  didn™t Œ ma ny didn™t. The A.I. Œ A.L., Armi a Ludowa, the 
Communists did accept Jews. Actually, the whole army accept ma ny Jews. My part did 

not accept ma ny Jews, but we had quite a few. We  had quite a few and those two were 
the best. 
 
Q: So, Icek and Icek did not come  back?  
 
A: Icek and Icek didn™t come back. Icek Pierwszy, Icek Drugi never come back. I don™t even 
know their last names. Never learned.  
 
Q: But the two other ones did?  
 
A: Those two other ones survived and came back. 
 
Q: Did you ever meet up with them again?  
 
A: No. They refused to write to me. I had a third hand information fr om them. One is still 
alive, I think. One is dead. Wa s Œ waŒ they said, ﬁDamn you, it was your fault.ﬂ 
 
Q: Howso?  
 
A: We ll, they served with me . You cannot, you cannot guess people™s feelings. They just felt 
that way, it was my fault. But Œ but I did not Œ we did not have people who had to be with 
me . Those people all volunteers. And we had them comi ng through the doors and 
windows. When we lost a person or two or three, we got 10 who wanted to be. Yeah, 

because they wanted to be active.

Q: How did your family, when they found out Œ well, I guess they knew what you were 
doing Œ they found out you had survived.  
 
A: They knew I wasn™t around. We never talked much. I came for a visit and say, ﬁWell, I 
can visit for a while, I have to be on the run.ﬂ They knew I was being looked after Œ I 
mean searched for. The Schutzpolizei would come  some time and beat my Œ beat up my 
father and ask for me . And he said, ﬁI don™t know. You came looking for him one time, 

he, he ran away and he probably is dead. Neve
r heard from him again. Matter of fact Œ as 
a ma tter fact, I think you Œ you took him to Germany. He worked Œ he wrote few letters 

from a place he worked in Germany, then he disappeared.ﬂ 
 
09:06:15 
 
Q: Your father must have been proud of you. 
 
A: I don™t know. I don™t know. He always ran me  down. Then one time, he was sitting on a 
fence at nigh Œ in the evening, with the neighbors. He was bragging about me . And I 
knew that he was not really Œ didn™t think I 
was wimp or nothing or next to nothing. But 
he always told me , ﬁOh, come  on, you™re so clumsy. Can™t you do this, can™t you do that?  
Get on the ball.ﬂ 
 
Q: Did you go back to Lesnogóra after the war?  
 
A: Never been Œ never went back yet. I think I have about one more person I™m waiting to Œ 
to kick the bucket. Then I go and spit on his grave. 
 
Q: Who is that?  
 
A: Okay, some body who is very unsavory, who is a traitor. Also, I have a good reason now 
to go to Œ to go back. I had a friend whose name  was Stefan, his last name  was Wojtyla 
and if you know the connotation, you know John Paul Two, his last name  is Wojtyla.
118
  
Stefan Wojtyla was my neighbor, was my fr
iend, went to school together. He did not 
want to join. When the Soviets came, he joined immediately. 
 
Q: Are you saying you were friends with the Pope?  
 
A: No, no, no.  
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I was fr iend with Stefan Wojtyla. 
 
 
118
 Karol Wojtyla

Q: Sorry. Okay, okay, okay. 
 
A: Stefan Wojtyla has the same  name  as the Pope. 
 
Q: Name ,okay. 
 
A: They are from different part of the c
ountry, they™re no relation, most likely. Stefan 
Wojtyla joined the Communist party, he was sent for training to Soviet Russia, he came 
back in 1949 or 1950. He joined Polish army. He became a law officer. He became, last 
time Œ he used to write to me , say ﬁStefan, come  back. Your were shedding blood, you 

were fighting. You will get your rewards here.ﬂ So we wrote back and forth and I 
discovered that Stefan Wojtyla arrested at least dozen of my people and at least eight 
were put against the wall and shot without trial. In 1973, he became a persecutor general 

of the Polish armed forces and was the last time he wrote to me, because I wrote him that, 
ﬁYou dirty, damn Communist. Why did you have to do that? ﬂ  So he wrote back, ﬁI 
haven™t done anything, I helped a lot of people, I helped a lot of people.ﬂ And I wrote 

him, ﬁDo you want a feather in your hat?  You want me  to come  back and you put me  
against the wall? ﬂ So he wrote, ﬁI would never do that to you, you were my friend 
always, you always will be my friend. But I am becomi ng the prosecutor general of the 

Polish arme d forces and I cannot write you to Œ to you any more. But I promise you that 
Œ your folder, that is about three inches thick, is going to disappear when I get my 
position. Nobody™s going to see it again.ﬂ And my sisters, when they came Œ they came 

here, said, ﬁYes, he came for a visit, many times,ﬂ and the times were hard in Poland, so 
shŒ they said that he brought always some  very exquisite food. He always brought a 
bottle of champagne and Œ with a lunch with him and he said, ﬁI never will forget what 

you did for me .ﬂ He said, ﬁWhen I was a kid, 
and we were dirt poor, when Stefan and I 
were going to school in the morning, I would sneaked into your house early and your 

mother always would give me  a good breakfast with Stefan. And then we walked our 

three kilometers to school.ﬂ He said, ﬁI™ll never forget that. And you can write Stefan that 
I would never hurt him.ﬂ Anyway, when I go back, I will spit Œ 
 
09:10:30 
 
Q: On his grave?  
 
A: Well, probably not. I should be Christian and forgive him. But I can not forget. Just like 
that Œ there™s a little German saying that says, ﬁOrte und Zeiten der Schrecken die wir 

niemals vergessen werden.
119
ﬂ ﬁThe times and places of horror, we should never forget.ﬂ 
Especially this day and age. You know, you talk to young people Œ I spoke to about 110 

young people in a mi ddle school about two weeks ago. And they had a course on 
Holocaust, they wanted to know what was going on. They don™t know who Hitler was. 

They heard little of Stalin, they don™t remember who Roosevelt was. They learn little 
 
119
 The places and times of terror should never be forgotten. (German) 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387

about the Holocaust. They were living Œ reading Elie Wi esel, the book Œ little book, 
Night
. They were just about few pages gone and they wanted to ask ma ny questions and I 
told them little story. So I frequently go and talk to group Œ various groups of people, 

willingly, and few of us that are still alive should not forget. And it seems like your 

people with the museum there and whatever information you impart to people  must have 
some influence, because a lot of schools, even grade schools, have a special course every 
year on the Holocaust. And as far as I know, almost all the mi ddle schools here, 

especially the religious schools, Catholic and Lutheran schools, do have it too.  
 
Q: So you Œ you Œ you didn™t want to go back, because it was Communist and so Œ 
 
A: Well, I Œ I Œ I could not go. 
 
Q: You couldn™t go, right. 
 
A: Because those people are Œ my sisters wrote me in 1955, I think and said, ﬁWell, we 
would like to see you, but if you come , you ma y end in a piaskowo.
120
ﬂ Piaskowo is a 
cemetery Œ is a sandy hill. Said, ﬁBecause many people like you are being taken out.ﬂ I 
had two little relatives, they were two girls my age. They were actually my nieces but I Œ 
they were my age. In 1947, they were arrested, they were mi streated, they were sent to 

jaiŒ to prison for 10, 15, 20 years. They were exonerated in 1960, released and they even 
were allowed to live in Wa rsaw, which was a great privilege. They™re both dead. They 
didn™t survive very long.  
 
09:13:54 
 
Q: Your, your parents survived the war?  
 
A: My father survived. My Œ my mother was dead by then. My mother was a war, war 
casualty. She had a baby and all doctors were arrested and sent to concentration camps. 
She had a very child Œ difficult childbirth and she died in childbirth at 41. 
 
Q: Died?  
 
A: Yes. But those two girls in question, they were couriers for our underground. They 
carried mostly explosives on the train. They™d have two huge suitcases of explosives, get 

on the train, they spoke little German. They™re pretty young girls. Well, frequently they 
would get into a German car Œ a bunch of German soldiers, officers had a special car, so 

they™re, ﬁMädchen, mädchen, kommen Sie hier.
121
ﬂ So they would came with the big 
suitcase that the German would pick up the suitcase, put it up on the upper. Because there 
were controls frequently, they would stop a train and search and contraband like food, the 
 
120
 Sandy hill (Polish); colloquially ﬁcemetary.ﬂ 
121
 Girls, girls, come here! (German) 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387

so-called black market, which was a free market, people training would be stole Œ taken 
away from people. So if you are pretty girl and you carry that, Germans invited you, took 
your bundle there and nobody could come  and search you. And they would come  to 
Wa rsaw and said, ﬁauf wiedersehenﬂ and ﬁdanke schönﬂ and went blissfully their own 

way with four big suitcases, carrying enough stu
ff to blow up four Œ four or five trains. 
But the Communists got them. They said, ﬁBut we helped you.ﬂ ﬁWell, helpers like you 

we don™t need any more.ﬂ Just like with my four boys. ﬁHelpers like you we don™t need 

any more.ﬂ  
 
09:15:59 
 
And ma inly, we were helpers in one aspect. In 1943, in summe r, a Communist young 

ma n, slightly older than I, came and talk Œ talked. He said, ﬁStefan, we need to blow up 
something and I know that you can do it.ﬂ I said, ﬁYou™re a dirty Communist. I wouldn™t 
bend my finger to do anything for you.ﬂ ﬁBut you know, you really got to help us. You 

really got to help us.ﬂ So I talked to my comma nder and my comma nder said, ﬁOh, you 
stupid so and so. Go help them?  If you go and lose your behind, it will serve you well 
because you lost your head already.ﬂ But he reconsidered. Few days later he came and 

said, ﬁYes, you can go and help them. I talked Œ we talked.ﬂ So they provided me  with 
two Œ well, they gave me  two of my boys and myself and a load of explosives. And 
provided us with a German chauffeur. German chauffeur who was carrying a truckload of 

arm Œ war material to a certain spot. And we™re going to that spot. It was kind of an army 
filled depot. There were a lot of explosives there and then tanks and aircraft  bombs and 
God knows what else. So he left us out in the forest. He went and delivered the stuff and 

then came back and he was going to wait for us in the forest. And I was told, ﬁYou send 
one boy, if he doesn™t ma ke it, send a second one. Don™t go yourself, because if you go, 
you get court ma rtialed when you get back.ﬂ So one of my boys went in, he went under 

the first wire and had a little shovel, dug out. Then he went to a second wire and a dog 
got him. And the guards, the SS guards came in and shot him. And well, he didn™t suffer 
because they shot what he had with him and he just groŒ got blown up to smithereens. So 

then I said, ﬁWell, your turn.ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, I™m not going.ﬂ I said, ﬁBut you have to, you 
swore.ﬂ ﬁYou can shoot me , I™m not going. I™m not going to help those son of a bitches 
against those son of a bitches.ﬂ So I said, ﬁWell, you don™t have much choice, do we?  I 

have to shoot you.ﬂ ﬁWell, go ahead and shoot me . You™re my friend. I would rather be Œ 
be shot by a friend than Œ then relative.ﬂ So I said, ﬁWell,ﬂ I said, ﬁI™m going to try, but 
be sure when we come back, don™t you ever tell.ﬂ Said, ﬁI™ll save my life, I won™t tell.ﬂ  
 
09:19:11 
So I went Œ I went to the first place, I went to a second place, there was still stuff around. 

It was muddy also, but was quite muddy from the person who blew up. And a dog came  
and for quite sometime Œ I don™t know if I had Œ it™s like I had affinity with dogs. 
Actually when we walked Œ my group walked to the village and I was with them, not a 

single dog would bark. And a bunch of dogs would foŒ I would go Œ walk behind and a 
bunch of dogs would follow me  and squeal Œ wanted to be petted. So the dog came and 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387  
77 
 
                                                          
he squealed and I petted him and he raised his Œ his Œ his leg and sprayed me from head 
to toe. I was so ma d at that dog. I said, ﬁIf that was elsewhere, I would show you what is 
what.ﬂ And the guards came by and the dog followed them and I was right at their feet 
there. They never looked. So I scrambled in Œ I walked in. I had Œ I always ruled by 17, I 

had Œ my lucky 17. So I went for my 17 charges, put them here and there. Then I got out 
the same  way, I watched the guards when they just passed. I got from Œ was a kind of a 
half truck standing nearby, got from behind it. Scrambled under one wire and a second 

wire and ran like hell. Got to my boy, grabbed him and we both ran like hell. We got to 
the forest. Probably was a good kilometer, was like three-fourths of a mile. He started the 
truck, we drove. We drove like hell for about 10 - 15 mi nutes and it blew up. The first 

explosion blew up all the windows in the truck, back and front. And then it blew and it 
blew and it blew and it blew. It was just like an atomic f Œbomb fireworks. They were 
preparing pa Œ putsch on Moscow and the Russians Œ and the Russian under Œ Soviet 

underground wanted badly to demolish this. So that™s why my boys, after the war were 
invited to the big party. ﬁYou did for us, you did for us, but now we don™t need you any 
more. Also, people like you we don™t need here. Out you go.ﬂ And they asked about me  

and they said, ﬁThe Germans got him, probably killed him.ﬂ 
 
09:21:55 
 
Q: It™s interesting, I hear more bitterness in your voice about that than I have heard about 
other things. 
 
A: We ll, yes. I think we Œ I thought we did them, did them a favor. I was sorry to have done 
it, but was fun to blow up that thing. Oh my God, it was just like a Œ like a Easter 
Monday Œ like Easter Sunday. You should see those explosions, sky high, flying in every 
direction. Oh, it was a blow out. I was practi
cally intoxicated watching it. But we were 
repaid and my friend Stefan Wojtyla me ntioned it. He said, ﬁThey would never do 
anything to you.ﬂ So later on I wrote to some body, ﬁAsk Stefan what happened to my 
four boys.ﬂ Later on he said, talked to some , ﬁIt was an aberration.ﬂ Anyway, he went to 

his rewards. I don™t know, ma ybe he Œ ma ybe he became a good Christian and is happy in 
paradise, playing the lyre. But I kind of suspect that the good Lucifer is poking him with 
a fork now, là-bas.
122
 
 
Q: You lived in the Œ tell us a little bit about the displaced person™s camps. When you got 
better Œ 
 
A: Yes, when I Œ when I receiŒ became better, I was in a Œ a Hohenfels, then I was in Lohr, 
which was not really Œ it was like a hospital, it was called sanatorium. Then I became 
better and I went Œ was sent to Aschaffenburg, Jäger Kaserne,

time and I became an accountant in the kitchen. Well, the Jäger Kaserne was disbanded, 
we went to a da Œ different Kaserne, closerto Aschaffenburg, within a city, stay there for 
a time. Then I worked as a courier there, for a time, between those three camps. There 
was Ukrainian camp and two Polish camps. Then we were se Œ to Œ moved again to a 

camp, Wildflecken, which is close to Schweinfurt in Bavaria. It was enormous German 
army camp. I think it was the ski troops that were trained there. Enormous, there were 
probably 15 - 20,000 refugees there. By that time I was Œ for a time I was stenographer 

for the police force and then became a detective and worked there for the duration as a 
detective until I left in 1949 for America. 
 
Q: What did you investigate?  
 
A: Local crimes, there were some murders, there were some rapes, there were some so 
called suiŒ faked up suicides Œ murders that looked like suicides. There were malpractice, 

medical malpractice. I had one medical malpractice where a lady went to have a appendix 
taken and the doctor forgot to tie one blood vessel and she bled to death, into her 

abdomen. And some  interesting cases. Shoot Œ shoot-outs with gangs occasion, but very 
seldom. 
 
09:25:21 
 
Q: Gangs?  
 
A: Well, there were Polish gangs that went Œ black market operators mostly. Well, if for 
instance, we™d go to a farm and they would need a cow, they put boots on a cow legs and 

lead the cow to the camp and lead the cow to the fourth floor to the attic and slaughter it 
and have a lot of meat to sell. It was all kind of shenanigans going on. And from time to 

time I would ma ke a document for some body. See, people who escaped from across Œ 
from there Œ behind Iron Curtain, some  want Œ some  had a hard time documenting 
themselves. So when I felt that some body was not guilty of anything and worthy, more or 

less, I would Œ I was specialist in sacramŒ sacŒ document forging. When I was still in 
Polish underground, I went through a crash course and worked for sometime in the so 
called ﬁpsychological warfare.ﬂ Kind of got to Œ little vacation from my group. From a 

fighting group. So I could ma ke documents. I can ma ke you a document. I can ma ke a 
stamp. I can forge your signature or your signature and your signature, if I Œ if I want to Œ 
if I practice long enough.  
 
09:26:42 
 
Q: There™s a thread here, it™s like you™re very good at investigating and underground work 
and being, I think probably really analytical in assessing situations and being able to 
figure out how to handle them.

A: That™s why I™m still alive, I think. Of course, holy providence had something to do with 
it, but most of the time I avoided getting killed. I got beaten Œ I, I got almost fi nished off 
one time, when I worked in a tunnel. I had a Kapo who was a Czech, he hated Poles and 
he hated me  specially. ﬁYou shitty little Polack.ﬂ He would beat me  up and do things to 

me . So, one time I was working up Œ up there and he was passing by and I took the 
railroad tie and I put Œ put it down on him. Got him hit quite badly. Anyway, I was very 
sympathetic when I later on saw him. ﬁOh, Gabriel you get hurt?  Oh, you poor thing, 

what happened to you? ﬂ He said, ﬁSome son of a bitch tossed a railroad tie on me .ﬂ 
Anyway poor Gabriel got so bad that he lost his Kapo job and he got the shits and if you 
got those, you got loose stomach in a camp, you are done. So, I even went and burned my 

portion of bread for two days and fed it to him. Cause if you got very loose stomach, 
which was a killing thing, three days you are done Œ if you had enough bread and charred 
it and ate it, it would stop it. So I fed the poor Gabriel with my own bread and every time 

I turn around, I felt like spitting in my face, helping that old son of a gun. I mean he was 
old, he was 31, but he was old in comparison, I mean he was. And I don™t even know if 
he survived or not because I was transferred to a different barrack and he stayed in the 

same  barrack. I don™t know if he ma de it or not. That old Gabriel, Angel Gabriel, he was 
not. I still got a little scar, he one time chopped me with a Œ with a shovel, just swung the 
shovel and cut me right over my forehead. 
 
Q: How did you have compassion for him?

[Technical conversation] 
 
Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski. It is April 8, 1998. We  are outside of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape 10. 
How Œ how did you have compassion for some one like the Czech Kapo?  
 
A: I don™t know. I felt sorry for that Œ for that old, shitty son of a gun. I kind of forgot what 
he had been before and didn™t really dwell upon it. Things happen and you go. And 

ordinarily we did help one another. We  did 
help one another. It was kind of a dog eat dog 
at times, when some people tried to get to the top and become a top dog, they had to kill 
and steal and do the horrible things. But there was cases people did help one another. I 
didn™t Œ I don™t know if I felt compassion or if I were just Œ saw him so mi serable, I said, 
ﬁOkay, you dog, eat that bread. Maybe Œ ma ybe your loose stomach will stop.ﬂ 
 
Q: Did he change his attitude towards you, afterwards?  
 
A: He was still grumbling. He didn™t call me names any more. Because I waŒ by that time I 
was stronger. And he lost his job. He lost 
his job. He was not a lord almi ghty any more. 
He could kill all 25 people he had, in one day, if he wanted to. He would get 20 Œ a pack 

of cigarettes for it. He did beat ma ny people, I don Œ never saw him kill anybody, but he 

could if he wanted to. So ma ybe he wasn™t very bad. But angel Gabriel, he was not. 
 
Q: How Œ how do you think that Œ that Œ those experiences in the war and then in the camps, 
how did they shape you as a person?  
 
A: I don™t think they made me any better. Maybe they made me a little more understanding. 
But they did not deflate my ego. And I still talk a blue streak. Well, they made me Œ 
surviving it made me very thankful, as I previously said. I never prayer Œ had Œ pray a 
prayer of petition. I always say a small prayer of thanksgiving. So it made me appreciate 

life and the presently, I mean, I wake up every morning and I feel so free. And I™m not 
hungry and I™m not cold. And I have a darn good job. I love books and I work with 
books. I buy a lot of books, I™ll sell a few books. I™ll read. I work five and a half days in 

the bookstore. Every second Monday, you go to public library, we get our 10 or 15 
books, so we have some thing to read. Sylvia reads too, a lot. 
 
10:03:31 
 
Q: Yourwife?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387  
81 
 
                                                          
A: My wife, Sylvia reads a lot, too. And every Thursday Sylvia come s downtown on a bus 
and we have lunch and we talk blue streak. Because norma lly, after supper Œ when she 
has supper ready when I come  from work. I come  on a bus and I walk a mile. We  eat 
supper, I wash the dishes and we sit with our noses in a book. So, to preserve domestic 

tranquillity, we get together once a wook Œ once a week and we have a lunch out. Just 
like one person said, I think it was a good saying, ﬁMy family Œ family ate out a lot, but 
they always went to the cheap places.ﬂ That™s it.  
 
Q: You said that you wake up and you think, ﬁI™m not cold, I™m not hungry.ﬂ 
 
A: And I™m free. 
 
10:04:29 
 
Q: ﬁAnd I™m free.ﬂ And that ma de me  wonder, is
 that feeling of Œ of having everything taken 
away from you, of being hungry, or your freedom 
being taken away, is that a really real 
feeling sometimes?  Can you remember it like it™s right there?  
 
A: I can Œ I can™t remember it. Occasionally Œ well mainly, what Œ I remember it in the Œ in 
dreams. I used to have nightmares. Presently I have them very seldom. I probably will 
have one next couple nights. When I saw 
Schindler™s List 
Œ after I saw 
Schindler™s List
, I 
had a couple real Œ just almost like Œ like it really happened there and I was there back Œ 
back there. But it is so far away. One time, St. Paul Cathedral was showing a film, 
Nacht
124
 Œ 
Night and Fog
. The film still exists. It was made by the Polish French 
company and you can still get the video of it. Anyway, I was asked to come  and watch 

with them and to talk about it later on. Well, it was shortly after I came here and after that 
went Œ that went through, I could not talk, ma inly because I saw the steps. Hundred and 

eighty-six steps from a stone quarry, leading to the camp in Mauthausen. And I walked 
those steps for 11 days, carrying a big stone. When you first came into Mauthausen, you 
went through the introduction, you were put in a Strafkomma ndo, punishme nt company. 

You went down to the quarry and you went up, you went down. Oh, it was about six, 
seven times a day and you took the biggest stone you could carry, because if you didn™t, 
when you got to about 100 steps up, the Kapo would look and said, ﬁHey you and you 

and you and you, step out there. You stupid so and so. Look at the rest of them, they are 
just breaking down, getting ruptures. And you 
took two those little stones? ﬂ So he give 
them a push and they would fly down. And that happened just about every day. Five, 10 - 
15 -20 people would be killed a day, in the Strafkomma ndo. And some time, when he had 
a special order, they would make people run. It was Fliegerbrücke,
125
 the flying bridge. 
There was a kind of a little platform and he would run people to the platform and they 

would fly down, like two or 300 feet. And then the quarry supervisor started complaining 
that they me ssed Œ ﬁHe is me ssing up my work, so ma ke him stop. That so and so is

messing up my work. He had all those Œ those Œ all that mess, those smashed prisoners 
there. I have to clean it up every day.ﬂ  
 
10:07:37 
 
So it kind of abated, but he was still killing people. If he didn™t do that, when you Œ didn™t 

like you or you got close up and the upper was kind of a steep road into the gate, front 
gate of the Grosse Tor Œ he would take your 
hat, we had those stripped berets Œ he would 
take it and ma ke it fly beyond the post line. And you had to put your stone down, 
everybody waited and you went to retrieve it. And that was a no-no, because it was 
beyond the line, and people up on the tower there would open up and shoot you. 
Some times they would just wound you, most of the time they would kill you. And you 

had to go and retrieve your hat because if you walked to the gate, you had to take your 
hat and walk at attention, you know, your hat to your leg and walk stiffly and carry your 
big stone here, you know. Straighten up. SS at th
e gate, if you did not have a hat to take 

off, they would take you Œ take you aside and beat you Œ most of the time they would 
take you aside and shoot you. There would be pile of people, dead bodies on the side, 
people who did not have their hats with them. Those little exercises. I made it for 11 days 

and lived to tell. Anyway, it was kind of a little introduction to the system. 
 
Q: And so when you saw those steps again Œ 
 
A: When I saw those steps, I could not tal k. Hundred and eighty-six steps Œ stone steps, 
quite steep. Just try to walk 180 Œ 80 steep Œ 86 steps carrying nothing, at a good clip. I 
don™t think I could now. I walk up a bunch of steps when you go to state park and you 
hear, ﬁOh, let™s stand down for awhile, Steven, let™s take a rest.ﬂ 
 
Q: Does it surprise you, what you were able to endure?  
 
A: Yes, it does. But in that time, it was nothing. I just thought I was tough son of a gun. I 
couldnŒ I could do anything. Especially after surviving two and a half, almost Œ well not 
exactly three Œ is about two and a half years in Polish underground with a Œ with a 
fighting group. That was a survival. Later on, camp at times, was almost like a Œ well, 

kind of a mild danger. You avoid this, you avoid that, you ma y live forever. You are 
hungry, ma ybe you can organize some thing, you can steal some thing. Maybe some body 
will give you piece of bread. Maybe you™ll catch a dog.  
 
10:10:14 
 
Q: And so, just tell us a little bit about how you left the displaced person™s camp. 
 
A: Yes, I Œ I stayed and worked most of the time, most of the people didn™t. They didn™t 
want to. People who stay in places who don™t have to work, they don™t want to work. We  
talk sometime about our welfare people, they™re paid little and not to have to work. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0387

People who don™t work, won™t work. There were probably Œ out of five, eight, 10,000, in 
Wildflecken, ma ybe 200 of us who worked. The rest of the people didn™t. And I knew 
one person who was a black ma rket operator, he was a rich Œ one rich young ma n. And 
each person were living in a camp had to donate half a day work to the camp, like 

chopping trees for the fuel, sweeping streets or
 doing some thing. We ll, he didn™t. So he 
was called to the camp director and the camp director said, ﬁMr. So and So, I have a 

report here you haven™t worked last week.ﬂ And said, ﬁMr. Director, that™s a lie. I never 

worked.ﬂ ﬁYou never worked?  You are supposed to work.ﬂ ﬁI pay well, people who go 
and work for me . When my time come s, there is a person who goes and works for me  
hard, for half a day or a day, I pay him well. Mr. Director, that™s a lie, I never worked.ﬂ 

That was the mentality of Œ that people developed. Later on when they went to various 
countries, there were some  were repatriated to Poland, but very few. When Communism 
took over, they did not want to, as I didn™t 
want to. Many went to Canada, ma ny went Œ 

ma ny Œ some  Œ everybody wanted to come  to America. Some  went to Belgium, some  
went to England. Many went to Australia a nd New Zealand. While those people had Œ at 
times had a hard time adjusting back and going back to work. So I stayed in Wildflecken 

until 1949 and the U.S. Catholic Conference found a sponsor here and I went through the 
consul and a doctor and document this and document that Œ all kind of little documents. 
As the Russians said, ﬁS propiskom vsyë mozhna
126
 zrobic.
127
ﬂ With a little card, you can 
do almost anything. RuŒ in Russia, if you had to have a propiska
128
 to move from place to 
place, to visit next village, you have to have a propiska issued by police because you 
cannot move freely. We ll, now ma ybe you can, but that time you could not. So all this 
little documents and you had to go through a doctor and Œ well, I worked part time with 

American CIC.
 129
 They came one time when I was still in Aschaffenburg.  
 
10:13:30 
 
Q: CIC?  
 
A: The American CIC people came and talked to me  and said, ﬁWe are catching some  of the 
German criminals and we kind of feel that you ma y some  Œ have some thing against it, 
would you want to help us? ﬂ  ﬁSure.ﬂ ﬁHow much you want to paid? ﬂ  ﬁPaid?  If I had 
money, I would pay you.ﬂ CIC was the counter-intelligent corps, U.S. Army. There were 

two captains who worked there and I worked 
with them until full maturation. One or two 
days a week I would get release from the police force and work with them. We  went 

across the green border into East Germany and occasionally apprehended somebody who 

was being searched for and brought him back.

A: Nazis Œ war criminals, yes. 
 
Q: The Nazis, okay. 
 
A: And then questioned them. Then when they had Polish Nazis questioned, I would help 
them question. Then when he had Polish Communists sneaking in, I would help them 
question those. So then they helped me  a lot, too Œ to go through and get in. Yes, but was 
mostly the Catholic organization who found me sponsor here. I came to St. Paul, I lived 

with a old couple Œ old, ancient couple for quite some time, paid room and board. Then I 
moved out and leaded my little Œ one little single room overlooking the whole city. I had 
a beautiful view, it was up on a hill. Old house with little rooms and a landlady who 

charged us very little rent. It was a very carefree life. 
 
Q: Is there something that I haven™t asked you that you™d like to say?   
 
A: Not really, I think we just did almost ever
ything. Oh yes. Yes, I Œ I me t Hans Christian, 
who was my interrogator. 
 
10:15:36 
 
Q: Your German interrogator?  
 
A: Yes, my German interrogator. Ph.D. from Heidelberg University. He was arrested, he 
was in jail under different name  and Captain Wulkanowski took me  Œ took me  to 
Brückenau, where the ma n was in jail and he said, ﬁStefan, ma ybe you would like to talk 
to this man, he speaks Polish.ﬂ So they took me to his cell and I said, ﬁHans Christian, 

what are you doing here? ﬂ ﬁWas machen Sie da hier?
130
ﬂ And he looked, he said, 
ﬁStefan? ﬂ ﬁYeah.ﬂ ﬁDu bist no™ nit tot?
131
ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, if I was dead, I™m resurrected.ﬂ 
So I asked him what his name  is and he had different name . I said, ﬁHis name  is Hans 
Christian. He was in Œ a Gestapo interrogator. When he was questioning me, he took me  
out four times and shot next to me , four di fferent people and told me  I was going to be 

the next one if I don™t tell him what he wants to know. And I know that those people are 
not tried to be executed.ﬂ I testified against him. So he Œ Mister Œ Captain Wulkanowski 
said, ﬁWellﬂ Œ he chain him. He chain him to the bed. He said, ﬁStay a while. Beat the 

shit out of him.ﬂ I said, ﬁOkay, I™ll stay with him for awhile.ﬂ So we Œ I stayed and we 
talked. He said, ﬁAren™t you going to beat me ? ﬂ  I said, ﬁNo, I™m not going to beat you. 
You will get your reward.ﬂ He said, ﬁWell, you know, really, I didn™t want to beat you 

either, but I was doing my job.ﬂ Said, ﬁWell, now I would be doing my job.ﬂ So then I 
knocked on the door and said, ﬁWell, I™m sorry. I™m going to testify against you, I know 
who you are.ﬂ And I did. And I understand that couple years later he waŒ couple years

later he was hanged. But I wasn™t asked to come to the execution. And Captain 
Wulkanowski, I walked out and said, ﬁTake my pistol, go and shoot the son of a bitch.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁShoot him?  You people can hang him, I don™t want to shoot him.ﬂ Yeah, Hans 
Christian. Beautiful, tall, blonde ma n with blue eyes and beautiful bleach hair. 
 
10:18:10 
 
Q: Some  people would have wanted to kill him. 
 
A: I don™t know. We  promised ourselves, when we were in a camp, when we were in Gusen, 
when the freedom come , if we are alive, we will go burning, killing. Not raping because 
we are not strong enough, but we will do horri
ble things here. Nobody did anything. The 
only one atrocity that we committed Œ that people committed in a camp Œ was a Spanish 

from a Spanish civil war Œ his name  was Santacara. He was Oberkapo
132
 of the fi rst shift. 
He had under him about 20,000 people. And he beat people and he killed people, he 
drowned people. If, if some body he didn™t like, he would just pick them up and Œ and tip 
him.  
 
[Technical conversation]  
 
He was very bad person, he would Œ didn™t like some body, he would lead a person to a 

washroom, pick him up and put him in the barrel head first and drown him. I mean he 
was just a bad person. Anyway, there were a bunch of Russians who hated him, because 
he especially hated Russians, I don™t know why, because he was a Spanish Communist 

and the Russians were Russian Communists, but he hated them. So they nailed him Œ 
they stripped him, they nailed him to the barrack by hands and feet and they took a heavy 
machine gun and they shot him to pieces. And I watched Œ when I was in the hospital I 

watched out of my window Œ was Œ my bunk was next to the window, I watched it. And I 
asked, ﬁWho that was?ﬂ ﬁOh, was Santacara.ﬂ 
ﬁOh, Santacara. May God be me rciful of 
his, of Œ over Œ over his mortal soul Œ immort
al soul.ﬂ So I know one Œ saw one atrocity 
committed by the former prisoners.  
 
Q: Is there anything else?  Besides these things?  I have got one question I™ve got ask you. 
Okay. 
 
A: All right.  
 
10:20:30 
 
Q: You said that youŒ [Break in tape] befr
iend him and how did Œ howŒ?  Did he know who 
you were?

A: Yeah, well we met Œ we met in a beer joint, I mean we were Œ a drinking place. And there 
were a couple street girls with me and I introduced him to them and he said, ﬁDo you 
want to come  tomorrow, have a drink with me ?  I™ll bring some  good schnapps.ﬂ So I 
came the next day. Instead of watery beer, he had some  good schnapps, we had a drink 

and we used to meet fr om time to time. And he even did me little favors. He liked those 
two girls, apparently. So later on discovere
d he was the supply officer, I kind of went 
cloŒ and I showed a bunch of money, said, ﬁWould you like some  money? ﬂ ﬁJa, Ja.
133
 
What do you want me to sell you? ﬂ I said, ﬁA Schmeisser.ﬂ ﬁJa.ﬂ ﬁZwei Schmeissers?
134
ﬂ 
ﬁJa.ﬂ ﬁFünf und zwanzig Schmeissers?
135
ﬂ ﬁTwenty-five Schmeissers? ﬂ ﬁJa. Wi eviel?
136
ﬂ 
So I said, ﬁWell, about 200,000 marks.ﬂ ﬁWell, zwei hundert, tausend?
137
 Hundert 
Schmeissers.
138
ﬂ ﬁGanz gut.ﬂ So he Œ he sold it to me. He had it delivered to a place 
where I want it, driving the truck himself,
 we unloaded it. He went Œ happy with his 
money. A good German can sell you his mother or daughter. Well, I have a Œ after the 
war I had a lady who used to do my washing, a German lady, refugee lady who had a 

bunch of children and she escaped from the eastern part of Germany to western part of 
Germany, she has a daughter, was ﬁRita the Virgin.ﬂ And I went out with her daughter a 
few times and she says, ﬁStefan, be sure that you don™t go to sleep with my daughter.ﬂ I 

said, ﬁFrau Anders,
 139
 I would never go to sleep with a beautiful young girl.ﬂ ﬁRita is a 
virgin.ﬂ Well, we called her from then on, we called ﬁRita the Virgin.ﬂ ﬁI would let Rita 
sleep with a rich American who would give me  a big bag of Polen kaffee
140
 Œ unground 
coffee. Because ground coffee was always adulterated. If a rich American came and gave 

me  a big bag of Polen kaffee, I would let him sleep with Rita.ﬂ So, a good German can 
sell you anything you want to, if you pay enough. Also I was lucky. He could have 

reported me . He could have shot me  on the stop Œ spot, too, because he was arme d.  
 
10:23:14 
 
Q: He could have taken the money and then reported you. 
 
A: He could have taken the money too. We ll, he was an honest thief.

[Technical conversation] 
 
Yeah, this was taken some time in 1943, on Sunday afternoon. It was shortly after my 
encounter with blowing the building where the Einsatzgruppen stayed. And I came home 
to celebrate and that was my neighbor, his name is Tadeusz and I™m the one on the right. 
And I looked blonde and bleached, with big, blue eyes. Yeah, that is a Œ a shield of a 11th 

armored division. Those were the people w
ho liberated Gusen Zwei, Gusen Eins and 
Mauthausen concentration camps. There comes a great detective in Wildflecken 

displaced person camps in Bavaria, Germany. I think I™m on the way from work. Don™t I 

look like a peacock?  
 
Q: This is about 1946 or ‚47?  
 
A: Forty-seven, ‚48. That is so and so in Wildflecken. It was a ma in square in Wildflecken, 
in the back there™s one of the buildings that people lived. And I think I was on the way to 
see a pretty girl.

This was taken shortly after I did get out of a hospital and went to sanatorium. My hair 
grow up and I gained a lot of weight. Ate a lot of soup and gained weight, probably half a 
pound a day. That is Hohenfels Erholungsheim. That means ﬁHohenfels TB Sanatorium.ﬂ 
It was a castle on a top of a hill that was used as a recuperation center for German fl yers 

during the war and after war it became a TB sanatorium for refugees from all countries of 
Europe. It is my Ausreise
141
 Œ it means document. When I worked as a detective in 
Wildflecken displaced person camp. It was at times fun, at times was little harrowing. We 

met all kind of people, some criminals, some petty criminals. It was an interesting job. 
This is a transit camp in Hamburg-Altona. We stayed there for about a week or so before 

taking ship to America. That was a document issued to me by German authorities in 
Bamberg, when I was in the hospital there, denoting that I was an honest to goodness 
political prisoner of the German Nazis. 
 
Q: Wow. That was probably an important piece of paper to have. 
 
A: It was Œ it was, yes. 
 
Q: Authenticating what you had experienced that.

A: This is a document issued by Polish prisoner organization, telling that I really was who I 
was. They had a very strict verification commi ssion. You have to ask Œ answer ma ny 
questions. They did not want Œ did not want anybody to sneak in. So that is the document 
they finally issued to me . No, I don™t think I want to go to work any more. Where do you 

work at?  
 
A: I work in a bookstore, down Œ

Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski, April 8, 1998, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number 11.  
 
A: All right. This is a poem, written by Polish poet, whose name is Michal Piasecki. He™s a 
Polish Jew who escaped the Holocaust simply because he escaped to Soviet Russia. He 
spent the war times Œ war time in Magnitogorsk, in Ural Mountains, working for the 
Russians. He had a great sympathy with the Communism and I don™t care too much for 

him, but he™s a good poet, I love his poems. I™m translating some of his poems to be 
published in this country, here. And this is one of them. I would like to read it in Polish 
and English.  
 
ﬁSzabas 
Juz biel sosnowy stol zaslania, 
Zapada zmierzch. W kuchni ogien gasnie. 
W lichtarze mama wstawi swiece, 
Diamentem pierwsza gwiazda blysnie. 
Ulica pusta. Zaraz zamkna okiennice. 
Nosiwoda koromyslo polozy obok klody, 
Do boznicy spieszy, wpierw grosze policzy. 
W szabas Fiszel nie nosi wody. 
Za oknem brzoza siega nieba, 
Swiatelka swiec niesmi alo chybocza. 
Cisza. Topola tylko liscmi zaszelesci. 
Matczyne dlonie plomyki zaurocza. 
Ojciec w niezlym nastroju zasiadl do stolu. 
Wi ary w lepsze  czasy calkiem nie stracil, 
By zamiast na raty, na weksle Œ  
Gotowka za szycie klient zaplacil. 
Trzy dania byly, jak ongis w Jeruzalem: 
Gefylte fisz w rybnym sosie, pulchna chala, 
Rosol z fasola, z cieniutkim makaronem,   
Kura Œ po zydowsku dzielona Œ cwiartek osiem mi ala. 
W szabas Bog nakazal odposzywac 
I nad Tora  chwalic imie Jego. 
Czynic mykwe czyli dobry uczynek Œ  
Zawsze, nie tylko dnia siodmego. 
Moj szabas zdeptano w czasach pogardy, 
Kiedy te skaze znalezli w rodowodzie. 
Kolorami  jeszcze dalie igraly, gdy, 
Przystani szukalem gdzies n Wschodzie.

Szabas nieraz w snach powraca, 
Ta sama gwiazda zamigoce, 
Te same dalie wciaz igraja. 
Przesnilem takie piekne noce.ﬂ

The English translation is: 
 
ﬁSabbath 
Our pine table is shrouded in white.  
Dusk come s; kitchen fires die.  
Candles in menorah mother will place, 
First star like diamond will shine.  
Street empty. I™ll close the shutters now.  
Water vendor his yoke will put by the well, 
To synagogue he walks, counting his pennies. 
Sabbath todiŒ today, Fiszel does not trade.  
By the window, birch racing for the sky, 
Candlelight timidly shines afar. 
Stillness, only aspen leaves whisper softly. 
By mother hands, the light shines bright, 
By prieŒ by prayer blessed, so then suddenly alive.  
This one and that one took flight to God,  
Praying and begging for plenty to all,  
Health of a husband and children™s health.  
Father in a mood, not ugly, sat behind the table.  
Did not loose faith in good times to come ,  
So that instead of hope in the promissory notes,  
For his tedious sewing, simple cash will flow.  
Three dishes served of yore in Jerusalem,  
Gefilte fi sh in fi sh sauce and a soft  challah, 
Chicken soup with beans with angel hair macaroni,  
Hen Œ Jewish style Œ divided to ma ke eight quarters of one.  
Sabbath is for your rest, just like good Lord ordered  
And with His Torah to proclaim his name .  
To perform ablutions and all those good deeds Œ  
Good deeds do always, not only on the Sabbath day.  
My Sabbath was trampled in these times of horror,  
When evil mark was spotted in ancestral scrutiny.  
Dahlias in bloom, charme d and enchanted us,  
Safe ha Œ safe harbor here I searched for in a Far Eastern way.  
Sabbath at times comes in dreams.  
The same stars are shining by,

The same dahlias still bloom.  
And still of great old times, we daydream.ﬂ  
That™s it.  
 
11:06:22 
 
Q: Thank you very much. 
 
A: I think I would like to give you an address of Mr. Piasecki in Warsaw. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: He wrote a book, 
From Little Town to Poland to Magnitogorsk in BaŒ and Back
. And he 
probably would be very proud to send you a copy for your archives and very likely he 
probably could send you some  of his poems. This poems were brought back from Œ back 
from Poland by Professor Sher,
142
 who is at the University of Minnesota. Matter of fact, 
he is presently teaching for three years in Auckland, New Zealand. It was Œ he™s some  
kind of a specialist in economy. He met that man and they talked and that man presented 
him with a bunch of his poems. And Mr. Sher gave them to me  to translate and he has 

intention to publish them, possibly in  a Tikkun Magazine.
143
 He™s still working on it. I 
don™t know how soon Œ how long will it take him. It seems to take him forever. 
 
Q: I™d be glad to take his address. 
 
A: Yes.
