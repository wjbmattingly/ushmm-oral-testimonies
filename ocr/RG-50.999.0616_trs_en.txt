You wil l know better, this is in Rom ani
a ,  a p ar t  of  R om an ia .  
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Anna, bef ore you talk about being occupied
 
--
 
you were just13 whenthe war 
began September
 
1939. But bef ore we return to the war and the Holocaust, tellus a little bit 
about yourf am ily and their life bef orethe war
 
of  what was your comm unity and yourf am ily 

 
3
 
lik e
.   
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Yes.My f ather was a very hard
-
working m an.W e had a
 
vineyard. And he 
worked by him self  because we were six girls,  sisters, not boys so he had to
 
--
 
I helped him  
som etimes but he was a very 
hard
-
working and honest man. Everyb ody respected him  inthe 
little town, or I should say village, where we li ved.
 
W e lived inpeace.T he older girls went to 
college and high school. My parentsf ound it very im portantf oreducation. And the younger 
girls  we
re  s t ill in  s c h o o l.
 
 
In 1940, I was 14 years old. I was ready to go tohigh school. But itwas not so easy 
because I had to go toanother city. Inour town was nota high school. So thef irstthing what 

the Hungarians did when they occupiedT ransyl vania, they stoppedJewish people to go to 

high school,tohigher education.T hat was my f irst terrible thing wh at happened tom e. 

Because Ineeded. For all m y lif e Im issed that I did not have that.
 
 
You have the occasion here to do
 
--
 
toeducate yourself. You sh
ould appreciate that 
because that means alot f or you andfor thewhole country andf or the whole world, the 

education.
 
 
So now I'm  going to tell you what happened in 1940.W hen the Hungarians occupied 
T ransylvania. For afew years nothing happened, let's say two years. They changed the 

schoolsf rom  Romanian to Hungarian.And most of the people in the little town were 

Hungarians and allpoor people.
 
 
W e were in good relationship with all thepeople.T hey were not against Jewish 
people. I should say that they felt badaboutwhat happened to Jewish peoplethere. In that 

little villa ge, or town, it was altogether 50 Jewishf am ilies. Andthe f irst thing what they did, they 

took the young m an and sent them tohard labor. So in the town remained only theoldpeopl
e 
andthe children because the heart of the people, the land, they were taken
 f
or hard labor.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Anna,I thinkone of  your sisters was m arried and her husband was taken. 
Righ t ?
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So she had tom ove home with t
he  f am i l y?
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
One of m y sisters, the oldest, was m arried. Her husband was calledfor hard 
labor. She lived inanother town, ina city, and she came home with a 3
-
year
-
o ld  lit t le  girl 
because shefelt safe to live with herf am ily.
 
 
Af t e r a wh ile
, they took m y father away f rom thefam ily. They said
 
--
 
a neighbor of  
ours saidthat he's a Comm unist.T hat's why they takehim .That was the reason. My father 

was not Comm unist because he was in goodm aterial conditionbutotherwise we were not 

Comm unist
.W e didn'teven know what Comm unist is. So they took m y father.W e lived there, 
noteasily, with m y m other and the six girls and the one granddaughter.
 
 
In May
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Let me ask you a couple of questions when yourf ather was taken away f or the
 
labor brigade, did yourm other know where he went and did shehear f rom him at all?
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
My f ather sent onepostcardfrom  near Budapest. He saidhe isall right and he 
is workin g as a translator becausehe spokeGerm an, Hungarian, Rom anian, and 
Yiddish. So 

they used him. But sinc
e  tha t 
postcard we never f oundanything about him .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Never heardf rom him again af ter.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Never heardf rom him again.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How did your m other, with six girls, 
how 
did thefam ily m ake 
ends m eet? Your 
father had thefam ily textile 
business 
and thevineyard had been conf iscated.
 

 
4
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Yes, because everything
 
--
 
we had food f or that time.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 O k.  
>> Anna Grosz:
 
And why m y m other could give to other people because she was a very gi ving 
person.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You 
said your m other was like 
Mother T eresa.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Yes.W ell, Ifeelaboutm y mother likem y God because she was such a 
personand I'm  going to m issher allm y lif
e . I
 
can'tforget what happened
. E v
ery day and ever y 
hour Ithinkof m y people who I lost, innocentpeople. Becausef rom af amily of nine we wer e 
then the six gir ls, onegranddaughter. My m other,m y father were nine,altogether. And this 

right now I am by m ys elf. Idon't have anything f rom m y oldf
am ily.
 
 
So in May the gendarm e came to our houseandthey saidthat we should have a 
f ive kilogram  pack andstay at the street because they wi ll com eand pick usup, some people 

f rom  the town.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I'm going to jum p inf or a minute.This is May
 
1944.You were under the 
Hungarian occupationfrom  1940 to March of1944. So you lived under those very diff icult 

circum stances. You lost your father. But things got profoundly wors e because now the Nazis 

have occupied Hungary in March of  1944. And that's what you're about to tell us.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Nazis did not com e. Just theHungarian occupied because the Hungarian 
were allied with the Germ ans. And that's why they gave it backf rom Rom anian to Hungarian. 

T hat's part ofT ransylvania.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So now you're forced out of  your home and forced into a ghetto. Tell us about 
th a t.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Yes.They said that we should prepare.They did not say where they takeus 
or wh y they take us but we went in the carriages about 37
 
k ilom e te rs .
 
First they took u
s in the 
Jewish synago gue. There were 205persons.T hat's what rem ainedbesides the people
 
--
 
the 
hard
-
working m en. Sowe stayed in that synagogue for about threedays andthen they put us 
in the wagons andtook us to the ghetto inSatu
-
Mare, which was 37
 
kilom etersf rom  our town.
 
From  other towns also, all the Jewish peoplewere f orced in that ghetto. 
 
 
W edid not know anything what happened inthe world because in ours, we had two 
stations.W e never knew what happened in the rest of Europe, thatpeople were deported 

bef ore us.W enever knew anything.W e justknew what happens imm ediately with us. 
 

 
Sof rom  that ghetto we were sleeping in houses on thef loor. Put yourself inmy 
shoesthat you don't know anything and why did you have to go that and what is h
ap pen i ng t o  

u s.  
Not long af ter that,we stayed in that ghetto
 
--
 
you want to say som ething? 
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Hehelps me out if  If orget som ething. I am  really f orgetful. Idon't know where 
are m y keys or m y glasses. But this story I wi ll never f orget it. You know? So I have to put it in 

short, in45m inutes, my stor y because if  I can say the whole story, we stay hereuntil tomorrow 

m orning. Youhave 15m inutesfor questions,also. So Ihave to really rush. Andplease don't 

bother me. Ok?
 

>>
 [
Laughter and 
Applause]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
SoAnna, you were in the ghettofor a shortperiod.And then you were sent to 
Auschwitz. T ell us what it was like for you to go toAuschwitz.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
It didn't happen so f ast.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But we have a little bitof  tim e. So tell us.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
T he 45 m inutes.
 

 
5
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Ok. A llrigh t. Go f o r it. 
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
From the ghetto they took about1,000peoplef rom the ghetto. They took them 
to the train stations.We didn't know the restof  the people who remained in that ghetto what 
happenstothem .Andthey didn't know where they go, where they take them. But when cam e 

the tim ethat we had to go, ourfam ily, or ourbuilding, they put us inthattrain.I was the92nd 

person in that train.W hat happened in that trainf orfourdays while we get to Auschwitz, we 

didn't know, that is something that no words for it to explain it how we were there.Because 

children startedto cry, old people prayed,other old people cursed because thishappened.W e 

didn't f ind
 
each other.My m other kept calling our names, the six daughters' nam es.We were 
not together.W e couldn't get thefood that they said we should takefor fourdays.W ater, we 

had very little. And in the one corner of the wagon was a big barrelwhere we had
 
to do 
our
 
pees. W
hen it wasfull, it started to comeout, you know.
 
So I can't tell you that time.ThenI 
thought that that was them ostterrible thing what happenstous, then I thought. I didn't think it 

would com e even worse than that.
 
 
So when the train stopped in Auschwitz, it wa s at night. It was neon light. Andthe 
dogs started to bark. People runaway. Germ an officers and soldiers [Speaking Non
-
Engli sh 
Language].W e didn't know what it is. T hey departed them enf rom the wom en.
 
 
Later wef ind out th
at he was the off icer, a 
D r.
 
Mengele. So when hegot to our 
fam ily, with his stick he says to m y mother, my older sister with the baby, 3
-
year
-
old baby, and 
m y younger sister to go in one side andElizabeth, Gisele, Anna and Violet to another side. W e 

neve
r saw m y m other,or m y sister or m y niece never again.W hathappened to them, they 

never know what happened to us. 
 
 
But they tookthef our of us, andm any othergirls who were f itto work, we were 
healthy, tall, and good for work, that's what they said, they sat us inanother side. T hey took us 

in a room .W e didn't know where we are because we were ver y tired and dizzy from  that 

four
-
day traveling in that train. W e didn't know what happenstous.So we had to do whatthey 
told us.
 
W e went ina room.T hen they shaved ourhead and everywhere thathair was. W e had 
to take off our dresses, everything. T hey tookus in a room  anddisinfected us, and poured on 

us som e white disinfectant powder, shouldI say?
 

>> Bill Benson:
 
P o wd er,  mm
-
h mm .
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
My son told me if  Idon't findthe right word, I should say som ething sim ilar. So 
that's what I'm doing now. It wasn't a powder.W hat was it?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Like a dust.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Dust.Ok. So insteadof  dustI saidpowder. [Laughter] I have m y senior 
m om en t s
. AndI don't rem ember words. Don't be surprised if  it happens to me thatI just stop 
for a second because I forget everything. I'm 91
-
year
-
old young girl. 
 
 
So after that, they disinfected us, they gave us a gray dress with a num ber on the 
sleeve because they did not have tim eto tattoo us likethey did withotherpeople. Hungary 

was the last country they deported.Bef ore all the countriesf rom  Europe.
 
Sothey said go in 
this place. It was a stall
 
--
 
here is a seniorm om ent. Alex, helpm eout.
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:
 
Into a barrack? 
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 Ho rses.  
>> Bill Benson:
 
Horse stall, ok.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
And we collapsed there. W e were very e xhaustedand tired, not eventhinking. 
And in them orning when we woke up, we couldn't recognize eachother the way we looked.
 
So I calledm y sisters and their names because we lookedterrible
, ti
red, without hair
,  
with  th a t 

 
6
 
d re ss.  
 
So we stayed in therefor abouta day, noteven one day. T hey tookus to Auschwitz. 
W edidn'thear about it. W edidn't know about what it m eans. So they put us inbarracks. 

Ho w
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
B a rra ck s .
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Barracks.W ehad just room  to lay down, you know. T hef ood
 
--
 
they counted 
us two tim esa day, that we could run away. W ecouldn't run away anywa y but they counted us 

in the morning and at night, f ive ina row, like this. And they still selectedpeople by 

coincidence
 
--
 
Im ean,to work. It was too skinny or toofast.So they take them  out.
 
 
Sof inally we rem ained there.T hey cam e to select againpeopleforwork.W e 
thought we could stay
 
there a little bit longer in another barrack.W ethought everything could 
be better than stay here in Auschwitz.
 
 
Bef ore they went to chooseusfor work, a 
wo m a n 
beforeus who was in Poland in a 
concentration cam p
 
asked where areourparentsand the restpeople. And she said," You 
idiots. You 
c r a zy 
people. You didn't know wh at happened to your parents? You didn't know 
what happened to us?I am  heref orfour years.
ﬂ 
W edid not know. 
ﬁ
If you want to know where 
are your parents
ﬂ 
--
 
she was ver y nervous. She s
aid, 
ﬁT
here, in that sm oke, there are your 
parents.
ﬂ 
Inthe crematorium .And we thought she is crazy andm ean.W e would not believe 
that. I didn't know what the wordm eans, crematorium . I was 14
 
--
 
we ll, 18 years oldthen. W e 
didn't believe that.
 
 
So they told us to goto work. 500 of us werefit to work. That's what they said. And 
we went to Stutthof, in another cam p.T hey put another 300 to us, selected again who isfat or 

who is skinny. T hey took us to a place and they said this is going tobe your working place. It 

was a big f arm ,a huge farm .T hey said you're going to buildhere an airport. You're going to 

build airport and the French war prisoners will  build thehangar.
 
 
Did I say it right?W here the planes
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Build a hangar.
 
>> Anna Gr
o s z:
 
S o I  sa id  it  righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You said it right.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
And the day we arri ved, was not ready the camp.So we hadto go about two 
m iles, straw onour shoulder,and carry it to the cam p and putonour bed there. It was three 

beds up. How 
we word  it? Bunk beds.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Bunk beds.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Yes. So it was so hot, I never
 
--
 
over 100
 
degrees. And we had to dothat. And 
there was no water, not ready the cam pfor us. And it was nofood that day also.W e couldn't 

sleep. For the next
 
day we arranged more but that day we all hadtocarry the straw sacks. I 
thought
 
--
 
I mean we all thought here is the place we all going to die. Because it was sohot 
and we had to work. Thefood you knew what was going to be.W eall were skeletons ina 

s
hort tim e, you know. 
 

 
So the next day they took usout.W e have to take out the carrots, the tomatoes,and 
m ostly beets,m any kinds of beets.W e were told you can't eatf rom  this. You can't take this 

because this is going to be your foodf orthewhole thing you are working here. And who is 

taking or stealing f rom  here is going tobepunished.Punished. As I rem ember, thepunishment 

was not even a slapon m y face. The whole18 years at hom e or in school I was never 

punishedbecauseI tried to be
 
--
 
m y parentsraised us with words, nice words, not with beating 
us or som ething. Punishm ent.Ok.
 

 
7
 
 
So we went to work on that f ield.W e took out
 
--
 
we were ver y hungry. And som e 
people took af ew carrots andhide it. And the guard was with us and had the numbers and 
gave it to two persons
 
--
 
I shouldn't say person, two devils there
 
who did thepunishment. One 
wom an was
 
--
 
I think she was a sadist because you could see it onher eyes. It was like acat's 
eyes. She was big and fat, at least250
 
pounds, and another one. So she was the punisher
. 
T hat's what she did there. And it was other soldiers and guardsthere but that was their job.
 
 
T he night when we arrived, the guard gave the num ber, thepersoncaught, 
prisoners, they did not have a name, just prisoners,num bers. And she hadtobend o
ve r
 
--
 
the 
devil ga ve 25 lashes on her back.That was the punishm ent.That was 
t he  pu n i s hm en t .  T he y 

did it with pleasure. One of them  was def initely sick, hatist.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So24 lashesfor taking a carrot.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
T h a t ' s w
hat she did, the punishm ent. And it always happened because people 
were so hungry that they risked it. And we have to stay and see how she gives thepunishment 

with hands up like this. To see to take an exam ple.
 
 
So that's what we wer e working, in 50 groups, 50peopleat once, ever y day, early in 
them orning andanother shif t afternoon.
 
Luckily, like no other camps, we hada bathroom .So 
we can wash ourselves, wash our dresses.W hen we washed ourdresses, we had to sleep on 

it to dry that dressor we sleep two in one place that they should dry the dress. Nounderwear 

at all. Only a dress, like that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Anna,af ter you cleared thef ield your job was tobuild a runway. And you had 
to take sand
 
--
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Sand.Yeah. Now I need your help. Thank you.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A ll righ t .
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
But whenI don'tneed your help, don't
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A ll righ t .
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell usabout the work.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
T hank you. I say thank you. Yes. 
 
 
O u r wo rk
 
--
 
I f orgot that

know. Our work was to f ill the carts wit h sand.T he train 
went away. And another train cam e but the wagon has to befull by that time. Andm y sister 

was ver y young, Clara, and not so strong liketheother ones.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Turn around a little bit to get your m icrophone.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Ok.So m etime s I listen  
to  
you. Ok. [Laughter]
 
 
So we have to workf or Clara alsobecause if the guard would seethat it's notfull, 
would take thenum bers and give it to the
 
--
 
let me say just devil becausethat's what sh
e w a s .
 
 
So we went to work, 50 by the group. And itwas guard, a Romanian guard, thefour 
sisters couldtalk to him . He wasf orced to go in the Arm y. He was nota badman. Never wrote 

thenum bersupeven if it happened. And we used to talktohim . He liked
 
m e to sing f or him  in 
Rom anian. By thattime I hada pretty good voice. I inherited thatf rom my m other. And she 

liked me to sing Romanian balladsand popular things. But did not give m e an extra piece of  

breadfor thatbut I sang f or him .Ok.
 
 
So we worked like this. How m any m inutes Ihave left?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Another 10 m inutes.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Only 10. Ok.I'm  going to rush.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W e'reok.W e'll make it work. 
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
So it cam e Christmas.W e worked like this throughChristm as.And Ch
rist m a s 

 
8
 
they said we shouldmake a showf or them because 800 young girl s,f em ales, there were 
m any talented people. So there were singers anddancers, etc.,etc. 
 
 
So startedthe show. I was sitting on topof the bunk bed. And the Rom anian s
oldier 
cam e tome and he said, ﬁW hat it is?Why didn't you go to sing?
ﬂ
I said there are som any good 
talent there. Idon't needed. He said, 
ﬁO
h, yes, you have to come to sing in Rom anian.
ﬂ 
A n d 
while I got off f rom  the topof  thebunk bed, I broke m y leg. Ifall and I bro
ke my leg. 
 
 
Now, we thought,this is theend of me. Because even if small or sickness, they sent 
them  back andbrought anotherone instead, that the800 shouldalways complete to work.
 
So what can we do? My sister went and begged this Romanian soldier. He
 
f e lt a  lit t le gu ilt y 
also because he wanted me to go to sing, guilty. I don't know how he felt. [Laughter]
 
So he was theboyf riend of that punisherdevil
. L
et me just call it that way, you know. And he 
went to her and askedher tonot sendm eback to Stutthof because Iwasn't able to work. And 

he cam e back and they put m y leg in cast, what was am iracle. Never happened things like 

this. Idon't think in all the cam ps that they put in cast somebody. They sent us right to the 

crem atorium.
 
 
So they putm y leg
 
in cast. Of course nothing sleepor something. The next day they 
hadto take it off because all m y leg was swol l en.T his is why I am lim ping allm y lif e.Because 

af ter they tookoff the cast, now I have to
 
--
 
it's not cham pagne. 
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Anna Gr
o s z:
 
It's you r f a u lt.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
It's ju st wa rm  wa te r.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
So I was lucky. T hey put m y leg in cast.So I have to m ake it very short, not 
details in between.
 
 
So after the December
 
1945, started the war
 
--
 
th e  Ge
rm ans los
in g
 
the war. Then 
the Germansemptied the cam ps and they put thepeopleto work, death
 
--
 
Death March. You 
heard about the
 
DeathMarch, you know.
 
Sopeople cam eand stayed in our cam p. Many of 
them  died because they m archedfor a long tim e. They madea big hole and they just throw 

dead people, wom an,m an, naked, shoes, without shoes. It was terrible thathole. It was not 

covered because they alwa ys had people to throw there.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Anna?
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Ok. Now you talk.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W he
nthey decided to startevacuating on the DeathMarches, your three 
sist e rs lef t
 
--
 
leave behind
 
--
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
I'm  there. I'm  not sof orgetful, you know.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
No, you're not. Not at all.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
So it cam e the tim e that our cam p had t
o m arch. So I couldn't m arch because 
I couldn't hardly walk. T hey took off the castaf ter three weeks, supposed to be there at least 

six weeks, the cast. And cam e thetime thatour
 
--
 
hmm ? Our cam p had to m arch.
 
So m y three 
sisters had tomarch. And I couldn't. I remained in the camp there.They tookoff m y shoes 

because I don't need shoesbecauseI don'tm arch. 
 
 
And six with m e takenout f rom the 800.W edidn't know what was going to happen 
with us. Som e guards rem ained there.W e were sure thatthey arenot going to sendus hom e 

but we knew that they were finished with us because they don'tneed six people.T hey couldn't 

m arch.
 
I was sitting in the end of a bed, without shoes,and I thought I shoulddie right away 

 
9
 
because I have no parents, I have no sisters lef t. Here I am and I was thinking I'm  going tobe 
in that hole, you know, where the otherpeople is. And then I started to shake.
 
 
I am  not a person whois afraid som ehow butthen I was so af raid. I thoughtthey 
going to shot us or send the people. But
 
I was sure this isthe end. 
 
 
S o  sittin g the re
 
--
 
Ibelieve in destiny, you know. It was m eanttobe.Because I was 
sure that I am  going todie there.They were f inished me like theother people.Sitting there, a 

person whoused to work in the kitchen, we
 
knew each other, she cam e tome and she asked 
m e can you sew. And I said, 
ﬁW
h y d o
 
yo u
 
ask m e if I can sew?
ﬂ 
Andthen she said
, 
ﬁB
ecause 
we are m aking civilian outfitsfor the Germ ans.
ﬂ 
By the tim e some Russian or som eone 
occupier wouldendthe war. And if
 
you can sew, you can help us and you can be with us.So 
that saved m y life.BecauseI went to sew with them .
 
 
Onenight af ter that,people still died andput them in thathole. Onenight the 
Germ ans disappeared
, t
he guards. Andalso they tookf rom the kitchen with them  in case they 
need.
 
 
So they left.T he next day we heard that theGerm ans blew the whole airport
 
--
 
wa s  
ready, theairport.Anda barrack, too, because it was on theend, bunks they laid down there. 

And who was in the barracks, they died there. But we runaway, a few of  us, and hide into the 

basem ent where thefood was usually for us.
 
 
For two days it was qui et. Then we cam eout.W esaw
 
--
 
when I came out, I saw two 
dots.Thetwo dots cam e closer and closer. I was dizzy. In thatbasem ent I got
 
the T yphus. So I 
was dizzy. But the two dots were two Russian soldiers, and camemore and m ore.
 
I don't know 
what happenedaf terthat but Ifoundm yself in a house that they toldthis was a hospital.They 

tookoff one probably dead that I should haveroom
 
in that hospital. 
 
 
I don't know f orhow long I was there because I was not conscious.But when I woke 
up, I had no hair again. They tookm y hair offagain. It was already grown out, ina year, you 

know
, s
ick,  t e rrib le  sick.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Anna, you had 
toldm e that not only had youT yphus, you were covered in lice, 
which is why they cut all of your hair
 
--
 
you we re covered in lice when theyf ound you, which is 
wh y your hair was cutoff again. Right? YouhadT yphus, you were covered in lice. You were 

ve r y
 
sick.  V e ry sick.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Sick af ter that.And they toldm ebecausethey needed thebedf or som ebody 
else. So when I cameout
 
--
 
they tookm y clothing also because it wasf ull with lice.
 
>> 
B ill B e n s o n
: 
Lice. Mm
-
h mm .
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
S o,  t he y ga ve  m e  
a skirt, like a sack, and a blouse,you know, with the stripe 
here,and nothing inmy head. So I cam eout. They said," Now you aref ree" .This isf ree. I 

cam e out and I lookedin the window, saw m yself, and I thought
 
--
 
Ididn't know whether to cry 
or to laugh the way I looked. Terrible! You can't imagine. Sick
,  
with thatoutf it. I wentoutand I 
didn't know what to do, where to go.T he Germ ans didnot take care of  us. T he Russians did 

not care of us.There were afew, not justm e,wandering around intonow
here.
 
 
Now I thought,no sisters no parents, Iam f ree. I think it was just imagine and put 
yourself  inm y shoesf or one second,m y feelings then. I wanted to die.T hat was m y quest, to 

die, because nothing was worse than death to know thatI hadnobody, by m yself, and I'm f ree.
 
I was sitting down and thinking onthef loorthere. Iheard musicf rom far away. A Polish girl 

andprisoners celebrating thepeace, May
 
9. Iwas sitting there and not thinking
 
--
 
I don't know. 
Once If eel ahand onm y shoulder. I was sitting just like this. He said, "Madem oiselle?" And I 

thought this is something terrible that som ebody calls m e the way I look Mademoiselle. How 

 
10
 
they know I'm  Mademoiselle and notam an? So he was a French prisoner. He knew who we 
are but never m et. Hegave m e chocolate and cigarettes.SoI sold that, cigarettes andthe 

chocolate,and I leave for them . For about aweek I get some bread or soup. But if  you went to 

a Polishplace toaskfor thefood, they never gave us. They said"W edon't have it" .
 
>> B i l
l Benson:
 
Inthe little time we have lef t, tell us about going back to your home and being 
reunited with your sisters. 
 

>> Anna Grosz:
 
Oh, I saved thatf or your time. ButI have to tell you.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yes. You have to tell us.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Ye s .  W a n
dering there, didn't know what happened. How do I gethom e? 
Something. I meta person there.She lookedatm e and she said," Do you have a sist
e r 
Gisele?" And I said," Yes .You look very m uch like m y sister." She said, "I was liberated with 

her and Clara."
 M
y other sister. And I said, " How aboutElizabeth?" And then she said shewas 
shoton theday of  the liberation. She couldn'ttake itanym ore.T he rest of the people who was 

shoton them arch. From  the 770people remained alive 230.T he rest were shot and
 
lef t, 
including m y self
 
--
 
including m y Sister Elizabeth.
 
 
So after a while wandering there, som ehow f rom train to train went,from  truckto 
truck, I gothom e. My s ister, the two sistersf rom thef ive, were home already. I was next af ter 

that. And Ithink
 
--
 
Itold you the
 
--
 
what I lived through. But the worst things happened then 
when I realized that we are justthe three of us in an em pty, robbedhouse, nothing in the 

house, and we aref ree. So m y father didall the things.W edidn't know how to start a
 
ne w lif e .
 
 
And another problem , there were no men around to get m arried because they were 
all killed inf orced labor. Som arriages like that, the brother
-
in
-
law cam e hom e because he lost 
his wif e with the children.T he sister
-
in
-
law was 20. Hem arriedthe
sist e r-
in
-
law and he was 
40. Im agine that.So we had to getm arriedbecause we hada big vineyard and nobody there 

to handle it.W ehad things to makethe brandy. No m anaround.
 
 
Finally m y sister couldget m arried. She didn't like to live there. Shewanted to move 
away f rom  there, back to his hom e, because he didn't like to do that. He wasn't trained for that.
 
So Ihave to get married because they wanted tom ove away. AndClara also. Clara couldn't 

get m arriedbecause she was too young. Nom en atthat age
. And I couldn't get m arried at all 

because inthat town was no men.
 
 
So what do Idonow? I had to get married becausethey want tom ove. I went the 
next city f or adoctor. I couldn't hear with m y ear because it was f illed with sand. AndIm et 

there a gir
l knew who I was in the ghettoandthe concentration camp. She said," Are you 
m arried?"  I said," No.
"  She said, " I am  married to m y 
f irst cousin and I am pregnant." Shesaid, 
" You know what? I know a m an who wants toget m arried."  He's31. I was 20 then. I
 
s a i d 
doesn't m atter.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
Even if he is crippled, I don'tcare! But Ihave to getm arried!Ok.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
It'strue . S o I sa id
,  ﬁI
nvite m e to your hom e.
ﬂ 
I ' m  go i ng t o  go
 
--
 
m y hair started 
to  gro w a  little  b it. 
My leg was swollen. So I went to her house, I took her dress to cover m y 

leg. I put som em akeup. I wanted to look good. And when I metm y "
h
usband," he was nota 
cripple. He was a good
-
looking, strong man.And we gotm arried intwo m onths. Idon't think he
 
was in love.W e were not in love.W e needed each other. But it wasa very
 
--
 
it becam ea very 
good marriage. He was a good, goodman.Iwas ver y lucky in m y m arriage. 
 
 
So we lived in a Com munist Rom ania then.W e moved together.W ewanted to leave 

 
11
 
the country to go to Israel or to Am ericabutthey did not let us out,you know.W hen Israel and 
Am erica started to pay for the passports, then they let us out. By that timeI was m arried, Ihad 

Alex and Andrew. Alex was 15. Andrew was 13.W e lef teverything t here what we had.W eleft 

Rom ania andarrived in Am erica.And then itstartedour real good life. Because the children 

were am bitious.W e worked hard.Alex is anattorney. Andrew is a geologist. T hey areboth 

retired. Ihavef our grandchildren. One greatgrandson.And I am here, an old sick wom an.T alk

>> Bill Benson:
 
Thankyou for asking your

W ehave a couple of  questions back here. Let's take these two and thenI think we're

d ire c t ly.
 
>>
 
Ho w were you ableto overcome so much tragedy and still
 
make such a positive, beautif ul 
lif e  wit h  yo u rf am ily?  
 

>> Bill Benson:
 
The question, Anna
 
--
 
>>
 
Overcom e the scars of  
th e
 
wa r ?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How were you able to overcom eall the tragedy you went through?
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
T hat's a very good question.I don't wish thatfeeling for m y enem ies how I feel 
and live with them em ories of m y f am ily. I'm  91 years old and it was notone day that Iforget 

that. And Im issm y f am ily. Not one day. Idon't think that anybody can understand thatonly 

who li ved it, too. Innocentpeople what happened.
 
 
I'm  supposed tohavea last word.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You wil l, yes.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
So I don't want tom iss that.My last word is about

>> Bill Benson:
 
Hold on to your last word.
 
>> Anna Grosz:
 
My last word is to you that you
 
are young people inaf ree country. Don'tf orget 

 
12
 
that we areall the same people. Not prejudiced. Andthe worst four
-
letter word you know what 
is? You all know f our
-
letter words. Right? It'shate.T hat's afour
-
letter word. Hatem akes the 
people unf ortunate, worst, prejudice. 
 
 
Educate yourself .It's very im portant. I'm  going to suffer all m y life because they took 
thatf rom me.W hen Iwas 14 years old. I couldn't have. You have the possibility. And Ihave 
hope in you saying that you will do that because you makem e happy if  you prom isem e that. I 

wi ll die soonbecause I'm  91. And I talkto God. And I ask you tom ake the world better and to

T hat'sm y questf or you. Ibeg you toforget the prejudice, toforget the hate because 
thatprovokes the w

I English language. Nothing is worst than the war. Nothing is 
worse than war. Because everybody loses. The people die.T he mo
thers
 
mourn their whole

Goodf eelings for each other. Notbad, not hate, not prejudice.
