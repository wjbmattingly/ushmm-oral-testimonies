until everything changed.

That was my grandfather.He was actually

And sowe just put onclothes, you know, a 
couple layers of clothes an d went on the

thing is, that shewas able 
to ship things to London. You know, which is a n unusual 
story, becau se, youknow,usua

Buttothis day, Ihave me norahs.Myda

seven days that you sit after 
someone dies.
 
Q:  Uh-huh.
 
A:And then sh e tried totalk hersi st ers an

to be it.You know, he's --

not just --wethen made friends with alotofother people.Infact, I'm still aclose 
friend ofsomebody who came from Moravska
 Ostrave that were closefriends ofmy 
parents.The name was Winer, (ph) an

Arnold .She'sstill alive an dsh

visit there andthey visited 
here.And they came toLondon.
And there were probably 
oh --not dozen s -- there were ma ny
, manypeople that came toEngland.
 
And that isamazing.Idon't know, because I
 know the British have
 notalways been 
wonderful, they were very difficult. We 
were inLondon atthe time ofIsrae l being 
established, andcertainlytheBrit ishwerepr
etty badabout letting Jews into Israel.So 
wewerejust very lucky.Wedid have an 
-- my mo ther had anau

happened an dourevacuation
 and the bombings and goi

Q:W as she d eported to aconcen tration campo r --
 
A: Y es. B ut, actually, n o t fro m Czechoslovakia. B ecau se o f my mo ther's b ig -- my

who ended up, besides 
writing thebook , be ing with th e Israeli DiplomaticCorp.He 
was -- after all he'd g one through , he wasfi
rstsecretary inLondon.Actually, itwasin 
Buckingham Palace with the Q:u een.He was 
also firstsecretary inSweden and liv ed 
in Stockholm for awhile.Hedid alot 
of re search.An d we, actu ally, you know,
 

have a--heput together afamily tree. No t somuch ofmyfath er's side like Ella 
Ginsberg, but of th
e Eh rlichside, which wa s my mother's maiden name .
 
Q:Did you spend alot of time with hi
m growingup, or was he adifferen t age?
 
A 
:
 He was older. He was, you know, Q:uite --
well, several years older, andnotthat 
much.Becausehelived in Kr akow, he visi
t e d u s a n d w e v i s i t e d t h e r e .B u t i t , y o u 
know --avisit would beash ort visit.ButI've been very close tohim.We've been to 
Israel now26 or 27 times.And so, you k
now, we 'v e been intouch.And they've been 
here.
 
Q:  O k a y .
 
A:Because he -- as Isaid, you proba
bly c anf ind th e book at , you know, a t th e 
mu seum.So that --but there are alot ofb
ook s th at have been wr
itten, but, of course, 
this one wa s published -- Iguess it wasase
lf-publish thing by Vantage. And it did 
have aforward, actually, Ithink, byElie Weisel even.
 
Q:  O k a y .
 
A:It was tr an slated from the Hebrew , no t 
on ly into English , 
bu t in to Swedish an d 
No rwegian. And so the book 
was in afew different places.
 
Q:When youfirst came toLondon, 
did yo u livein an apartment th ere?
 
A:No, wewent tolive with mygreat aunt
. It was my grandmothe
r 's sister.Welived 
w i t h  h e r . S h e h a d a h o u s e a t
 Six and Andrew s Grov e in Stamfo rd Hills.And we lived 

w ith her becau se my fath er was in thehospita
l, asIsaid, withaheart attack.Butonce 
herecovered, then we moved into an ap ar
tment atTwoStamford HillMansion.And 
that's wh erewelived 
until --Im ean, w elived there thewho le time, bu tI
 was -- we 
were evacuated part ofthe time .
 
Q:Where did you go when you were evacuated?
 
A : A village, which is no w a bigger town
, ca lledKennington, outs ide ofOxford .
 
Q:  O k a y .
 
A:   Kennington --
 
Q:Was that just you an dyour brother?
 
A:  A n d m y m o t h e r .
 
Q:  O k a y .
 
A:A n d my fath er used to co me o nthe w
eekend s. H e would be wo rking in the city . 
He was still working,he had his business. 
 Bu t terrible, terrible
 strains.Terrible 

str ai n s, you know, t ry ing to kee p the f amil y assaf e as p ossib le . 
In fact -- and I 
mentioned thistoAshley,
but Iwill tell you, Iguess, it
 was in 1940 thingslooked so 
bad in England.An d we thou
ght that--theGermans had 
invaded everywhere --that 
itlook ed lik ethey migh t b eco mi ng into
 England, too.So my father,being the 
wo rrier that h ew as, said w e
're go ing --w eh adanun cle inAmerica.H esaid w e're 
going tosen dthechild ren toAmerica. 
A nd w e stoo d in line andapp lied for all th e 
papers th at you need fo r that andgot ever
ything and were scheduled to take aship 
and go 
to -- actually , Ith ink it 
was Canada, bu tthen America.
 It left from Liverpool. 
And that ship wassunk, and, Ithink, 70 
some o dd child ren died onthatand o ther 
p e o p l e .B u t a tt h e l a s t  m i n u t e , m y  f a t h e r
decided we're stick --keep thefamily 
together. So even though we had al
l the papers to go, we didn't go.
 
Q:Soitwould have just been your mother and
 you and your brothe
r o n t h es h i p a n d 
he would havestayed in London?
 
A:Actually, Ithin k itwould have just been
 thechildren, ju st mybrother and I.You 
know, like --itwas like theKi
ndertransport, but itwas alitt
le different.  You know, 
itwas so me th ing that th ey weretry ing to 
arrange to get kids out of England when it 
looked verydangerous.
 
Q:  O k a y .
 
A:And Idon't know about mymo ther at thatpoint, but Idoknow that wehad all the 
papers weneeded.Andthenthediscussion
 withthefami ly andmyfather sa id,no, 
w e 're g o in g tos t a y to g e th e r .
 
Q:Doyoureme mb er anything elseabout 
that,what he explained to you abou t first 
go ing on th e ship ?
 
A:Right.He said, you know, I-- that the 
family need s tostay togeth er, butwe'l l try 
and stay safe. And we did in 
those days of the Blitz. It's
 anama zing thing, Heather, 
but thek ids used tolik e togodow n into
 th e Underground because they'd run around 
wi tha llt h eir fr ie nd s.Yo uknow, c h i ld ren
 areamazing, Imean,howth eyadaptto 
different things.And we wouldgo in to th
e shelters, youknow, wh
en the sirens would 
gooff.Andthen we'd bewith other kids an dother 
friends.An d that -- they so rt of 
learn toadap t tothe
 situation. And it was interestin
g because alotofschools closed . 
But there was one school that stayedope
n, and it happened to be aconvent, a 
Catholic school. And, of c
o u r s e , I w a s J e w i s h , a s w e r e a n u m b e ro f m y  f r i e n d s , a n d 
the convent allowed us to come. An dnot on
ly allowed us to come to the school, but 
w e hadasked if when th ey h ad their catech
ism andeverythingel
se, could wehave a 
Je wish teac her come in and theyallowed usto do it. 
So fo r part ofthe time -- and I 
ended up
with avery --even though Iwas 
ev acuated andinK enning to n inaon e-

room schoolhouse withmybrother,whowas 
four years older th an
 Iwas, andthen 
co mingb ac k to London and going to the co
nvent, byth e time Icame toA merica -- 
w e're gettin g ahead ofou rselves --b u tIstar
ted high school.And because ofthe years 
o fe d u c a t i o n Ih a d , t h e y  p u t m e i n  a s af r e s h m a n .B u ta f t e r Iw a s t h e r e f o r s i x m o n t h s , 
I became a n upperjunior beca
use ofallthesubjects we 'd
 already had,even during 
th e wartime.
 
Q:O k a y .A n dw e ' l l t a l k  m o r e a b o u t t h a t i n a
 min u te.
 
A : I know.  I'm sorry.
 
Q:  That's okay.  Can you ta
lk more about --didyou understand what wasgoing onin 
London atthetime ?
 
A : Y e s .
 
Q:Wha t di d yo u under st an d abou t t h a t?
 
A : We understood th at the Germans were 
bombingand were hoping tocome into 
England.An d we reallyfelt, maybe because
 wh ere w ecame fro m --th eBritishmay 
not have felt this way, maybe they felt a 
little stronger, you kno
w, that noone is 
g o i n g t o  c o m e i n h e r e .B u t a f t e r s e e i n g  w h a t h a d h a p p e n e d  i n  E u r o p e , 
there were 
times that wereally thought that theGermans
would come in an d invade Brit ain or 
London.
 
 Q: A n d d i d y o u u n d e r s t a n d  w h y t h e y  w a n t e d  t o  c o m e i n ?
 
A:   I understood th at Hitler wanted to ru
le theworld and get rid of the Jews, one of 
theth ings thathewanted, oneofthemain
 things th at he wanted.And theamazing 
thin g is that so mewhere o r other they said
 thatsomewhere in his background there 
was some Jewish blood. 
And, youknow, sometimes t
hose -- you can get Jews 
somet imes th at a re so se lf -- n o t t h a t he wa s Je wi sh , 
I'm not trying to say that. But 
they can be self-hating
and worse th an anyon e else against th e Jews.We did 
understand that,asJe ws,we
 were very vuln erable.
 
Q:A n d d i d y o u e x p e r i e n
ce anyanti-Semitism in
 London?
 
A:   Well, I know th ere was anti-Semitism. 
 But when I think about my experience at 
the convent and thefriends that
 Imad e an dthat --oneo fth egals th at w asinmy 
classactually became themother superior, an
d Ivisited her on one of ourmany visits 
to London. I really had very positive
 feelings about,youknow,howotherpeople 
treated us.
 
Q:How did you know that there was anti-Semitism
i f you didn't experience it 
yourself?
 

A : Well, I imagine -- I knew what happened.
Well, Ididn't know atthat time about 
th ing s like the con centration camp s. Bu t I kne
w th at --that's agoodQ:uestion. Idon't 
know.
 
Q:  Uh-huh.
 
A : I don't know.
 
Q:  O k a y .  M a y b e i t w a s - -
 
A: But there definitely was anti-S emitism in London. I mean, I 'v e read ma ny things. 
Youknow,people resented th eJe wscoming in
 an d taking jobs aw
ay and things like 
that. So I know that it definitelyexisted.
But we happened to live in avery Jewish 
area.It's even mo re Jewish no wthan 
when welived there,Stamford Hill. 
And soou r 
friends w ithJewish --now ,there
 was a Catholic school th
ere, but we belonged to a 
synagogue andattended services andreallypa
rticipatedinJewish lifethere, again, 
celebrated theholidays.Fridayni ghtsmy
 f a t h e r w o u l d b r i n g 
home people fordinner 
without even talk ing to my mother.S o we
'dalways havegu ests atFriday night 
dinners. And thing s w ere ratione
d, butsomehowwemanaged. 
In fact, Ire member my 
parents nevereating
 an egg because they wanted to give -- we got two eggs or 
something --givingtheeggs
 t o , y o u k n o w , t o  m y  b r o t h e r a n d m e .  T h e y  f i g u r e d w e 
need ed them mo re th an they did.So we ha
d, really, you know --
th ey were difficult 
times.Andwecertainly didn 't have th e same kind oflife th at wehad in 
Czechoslovakia. My mother was not workin
g.But, you know, she had to clean the 
h o u s e a n dc l e a n t h e f l o o r s .A n d I ' d h e l p  h e r , 
you know.So itw as ad ifferent, d ifferent 
l i f e , b u ts t i l l - -
 
Q:  Was your father wo rking?
 
A:   Yes, my father was working.
 
Q:And as afu r merchant or --
 
A:Yeah, still inthefurbusiness, yes.
 
Q:Doyoureme mb er anything elseaboutthat?
 
A:He had apartner, Ireme mb er, Arpud, (
ph) andmust have done okay beca use, you 
know, wehad food asmuch aswecould, 
youknow, with rationi
ng. We had a kosher 
ho me.  We were alway s --
 
Q:So you ma naged to keep a kosher home?
 
A:   Y e s .
 
Q:  Uh-huh.
 

A : Yes.  Interestingly enough, and at leas
t inLondon.And inKennington, Ihave no 
idea because theyhad never seen aJew 
b efore.A nd when we came there,t h ey 
actu ally wantedtokno wif 
we had horns.And,again,my mo ther , ended up charming 
t h e m . S h e ' d i n v i t et h e m o v e r a n d sh e ' d b a k e s t r u d e l a n ds t u f f .A n d t h e r ew ew e r e 
billeted orlived with anAnglican minister inhishouse, you know, when wewere 
evacuated, mymo ther,mybrother, andI. 
An d when my father came, h e wouldstay 
th ere, too,and--
 
Q:Was it ju st him or did he have afamily ?
 
A: N o , h e  w a s s i n g l e . H i s n a m e  w a s R e v e r e n d  W i l l i a m s o n . A n d h e  p a r t i c u l a r l y , I 
mu s t say , li k e d me .T h a t mi g h
t sound difficult t
oday.But as long as welived in 
England, hewouldneve
r forget mybirthday. 
And he was very kind to us, too. So, 
you know, it 's
 interesting, you know
, w ith all the anti-Semitism go ingalong , th e 
people th at wedealt with were very kind.
 
Q:Did you meet alot ofothe
r people inKennington aswell?
 
A:Oh, yes, Idid.Welived next toagirl 
wh obecame on e of my best friends there by 
thename ofMargeHoggnet. (ph) I've lost 
touch with her.Sheeventuallymoved to 
America.But I -- I tried to locate her. 
NotJewish, they were farmers.Andthey had 
chick en s an d they actu ally had sh eep. A nd I 
actually helpedwith--Ididn'treally 
h e l p , b u tIw a s t h e r e a n d t h e y  l e t m e d o s o m e 
sh ee ring of she ep .And so i t wa s, a g ain, 
a different -- very nice peop le. And they -- 
alot of ithad todowith the way that my 
mo ther behaved and,Iguess, thewaywebe
haved.And we -- there was only aone-
room schoolhouse, youknow,wher
e all the kids wentto school together.As Isaid, I 
went to school with mybrother, but -- who was four and ahalf years older th anI 
was.But we ha
d aschoolhouse.
 
Q:W ere yo u in the sa me class?
 
A:Yes, it was just one room.Oh,yes, 
just oneclass.Itwas just on e class.
 
Q:So you went toschool in Kennington and then
 a different school when you were 
in London?
 
A : C o r r e c t .
 
Q:And how long we
re you inKennington?
 
A:Well, wewere there twodifferent time
s.  One was earlier, you know, when the 
Blitz was re ally bad.And the second time
 --andIdon't know theexact dates,you 
probably can look that up--when thebuzz
 bombscame over an dthey decided itwas 
too dangerous to stayin London.The buz
z bombs were the ones that you couldhear, 

and then w h en th ey stopped 
they w ould drop andb lo w upwhatever they landed on . 
And that was later,you know, ma ybe in
 '43.The first one was maybe around
 
'4 0 , '4 1 .
 
Q:D o you re me mb er ho w long you we re i n
 Kennington each time , was it months or 
years?
 
 
A:It wasn 't years.It would beseveral months.Because wewould go to Oxfo rd , an d 
near Oxfo rd there w asactually anAmerican
 Air Force base and weused to seethe 
Y anks.  And th ere was an expression that 
the kidsthere used, got any gu m, chum.You 
know, ju st --youknow, itwassomething that
 wewould say ifwe
 met an American.  
And I did meet a couple of them.  But, 
youknow, how old was I,10, 11, so me thing 
like that.  We were young.
 
Q:Doyoureme mb er anything elseaboutthe
Americans on the base?
 
A:Wedidn't ever goto the base.They we
rejust young, nice guys.Youknow, this was 
-- actually,let 's see, America 
went into the war in'41, so 
th efirst time -- Idon't think 
they were -- the first timewe were there, 
Id on 't think th ey w ere ev en atw ar yet.B u t 
thereweresomeAmerican so ld ie rs thatdid 
come to Europe. An d there was a base -- 
andIdon't k no wexactly where itw as--bu
t itwas so mewh ere n earOxford.Oxford is 
a beautifu l city, very historic.
 
Q:S owh at e l s e d oyo u re me mb er ab ou t th e Bl it z
 and --
 
A:Well, after itwas 
o v e r , w e w o u l d g o  o u t s i d ea n d w e w o u l d t r y t o  c o l l e c t s h r a p n e l . 
Now, none ofthebuild ings where welive
d, youknow, were hit 
or blown up. But 
there was--youknow, there wasalotofdama
ge.And one of th e things th at we did 
as kids is wewould go out,
 you know, and collect shrapnel.
 
Q:A n d d i d y o u f i n d  al o t o f i t ?
 
A:  We found so me .  Found some .
 
Q:A n d w h o d i d y o u c o l l e c t i t w i t h ?

me ntioned toyou, but there was 
--there were other friends, you 
know, thatwemade 
as youngsters, you know, from school,
 from the neighborhood. Usually it was in the 
neighborhood .
 
Q:Did you ever talk amongst you

O n e o f t h e t h i n g s

 w er e as k osh er a s wec ould be, yo u know , 
and we were.You know, we k ep tsep arate 
dishes and -- for wh atev er food we had.
 
And when Iwas in the ho

forget this --and they didn't have much 
meat oranything else, and th
eo n l y t h i n g t h e y  h a dw a s b a c o n .A n dh es a i d  Iw a n t y o u

my mo ther, too. I mean, she was in Israel. 
She went to Israel in 1948.She was onone 

ofthefirst boats that went toIsrael. 
Actually, she sat at th

Bernstein's parents 
and remember ed the conversa
tion of how disappoin ted he
 was 
that his son didn't go into 
his busin ess. That'sLeonar
d Bern st ein, musician , of 
course, I'm sure you know. And 
1948, we saw her off to go to
 Israel forthe first time 
right after itwasestablished as
 a state. And sh e went many
 times.And once we were 
a b l et o , m y h u s b a n d a n d I , a s It o l d  y o u ,

know if thismarriage would have lasted.Bu t it was --I'm justmaking th at co mmen t. 

But he was wo rk ing 36 hours on, 36hours o

his internship. And a very good intern ship at Mount Sinai, New York. But when he 
finished theinternship andhewentlook ing

the se rvice toNewYork to finish training. 
But once yo u lived inCalifornia in those

hing else you can tell me
about California that wehaven't

A:Well, we live in avery -- you know, it
's a nice co mmunity. It has its problems, 
smog and probablyalot ofother things 
because we'reringedbymountain s.Buta 
veryclosecommunity, especially through 
thesynagogue, which is where we have a 
lot ofour friends.And I'm involv ed in so
me thing calledOsherandso methingcalled 
LIFE, which isLearning isForever, which isthrough theUniversi ty ofCalifornia in 

Riverside wh ichis for seniors.And we have lectures and progra ms anddifferent 

things.So, you know, it 's very nice being in
a u n iversity town.As I to ld you , I en jo y 

learning. 
A n d s o , It h i n k - - a s Iu s e d  t o  t e l l m y  s t u d e n t s ,
learning is not fo r making a 
l i v i n g , i t i sf o r l i v i n g a n d y o u s h o u l d  l e a r n a s l o n g  a sy o u c a n .A n d s o  Ie n j o yt h a t .I 
also volunteer with an or
ganization called 
HiCap, which ishealth insurance 
coun seling. Because I h elped 
my mo ther when she was ill.And seniors --because I'm 
asenior, to o --but alo t of
 seniors have at ough time
 navigating th ehealthcare 
sy st em, and 
probably is goin g to get wo
rse, youknow.Soth at's
 something that I 
volunteer with.AndthenI 
do stuff through the synago
gue,you know, on education. 
And my husband , as Ito ld youis still teac
hing.And we -- and whenever we have an 
opportunity to be with our ki
ds and grandkids, wedoth
at.  When my daughter was 
w o r k i n g a n d h e r h u sb a n d w a sw o r k i n g , s h
e sent her twins down for asumme r and 
t h e y  s p e n t t h e s u m m e r h e r e . A n d I ' d t a k e t h e m , y o u k n o w , f o r s w i m m i n g  l e s s o n s . B u t 

that was anumber ofyears ago.They now 
just started high school.And wejust 
figuredwe had better enjoy, enjoy the fa
mily when they stil
lhave time for us. 
Because, as I'm sure you know, 
Heather -- I don't know, you're a n intern.Ar e you in
 
school or out of school?
 
Q:  Actually, no, I'm a permanen t staff member.
 
A  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So -- but, you know, 
asyouget more involved, whether it's with 
educ ation o r wi thjobs, y ou know , yo u don't h av e as muc h ti me fo rg randpa re n ts and 

families. S o whenev er we have a chance -- 
we'r eactu ally head ing toIsraelinOctober 
for the 100t h anniversary fo
r Hadassah.All of us 
are -- my mo ther and my daughter 
and mydaughter-in-la w,
mygran ddaughter and Iare all life members.And right after 
that, itturns outth at it'sgrandparents day 
at my twin s' high school an d they just 
started high school.An d so we'r e goin g right 
fromIsrael up to Sa
nta Cruz so we can 
b e t h e r e f o r t h a t . 
Andwe're also g o ing upfo
r Sukkot -- unfortunately,
 it's no t as easy 
to get together for holiday s.All ou rchildren belong to synagogu es, wh ich ma kes me 

very happythat they're involved.And what
 will happen with thenext generation, I 
don't know.But we took everyone to Israel 
a couple ofyears ago.Actu ally, it was 
five years ago in2007. 
There were 14 of us that went. 
 So we feel it's very important, 
you know, for our fami ly toknow, know Is
rael and to know the 
history oftheJews 
and tobepr oud ofwho they are.
