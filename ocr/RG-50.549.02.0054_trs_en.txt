Interview with Amalie Salsitz 
July 8, 1999 
 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with Amalie Sals
itz, conducted by Regi
na Baier, on July 8
th
, 1999, in 
Mrs. Salsitz™s home. This is a follow up 
interview to a USHMM 
videotaped interview 
conducted with Amalie Salsitz on May 12
th
, 1990. The United 
States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum gratefully acknowled
ges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this 
interview possible. This is tape numb er one, si de A. To get started I thought it would be a 
good idea to tell our listeners wh
en you were born, and where. 
Answer: I was born October 21, 1922, ow 
-- by co incident in Munich, because my  
mo ther was visiting her fami ly there, she didn
™t expect. But I was raised -- I went through 
the Holocaust in Stanislawow in
 Poland, southeast of Poland. 
Q: And if you would no
w give us your names. The name
 you had a birth, the name you 
took on during the war, and the 
name -- and your married name. 
A: First I have to start with a joke. My late
 parents called  my Manya. First -- in the first 
grade I learned my  name is Am
alie when my teacher called out
 Amalie Petrenka to give 
me my rep o rt card. So this is the first time
 I learned that my  name is Amalie, on -- and 
not Manya. When I started as a Christian Po
le -- masquerading as a Christian Pole, I 

chose actually, my fictitious name, Felitsia
 Mewashefsky. I took Felitsia from L atin, 
Felitsia Felitsitakislak. Mewashefsky ma -- wa
s my beloved writer, I liked her booked. So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054

I dec -- and also, I had a German French r. 
Wh en I was masquerading, I had to blend -- 
almo st hundred percent the local population, 
to the Slavic r. So 
naturally, I tried to 
eliminate r from any possible word
 that I can -- that I can. Otherwise, probably, I would 
have remained Petrenka, because Petrenka is
 not a Jewish name. But, I have chosen 
Mewashefsky. I stayed with minash -- Me
washefsky till I got married to Norman s -- 
actually Naftali Salishitz at that time. So I became Amalie Salishitz
. When  we came to 
United States, he changed his na
me Salishitz to Salsitz, beca
use his oldest brother, who 
was here for 20 years, at -- before m-my 
husband -- after my  husband was born. So he 
wanted to have the same family name 
so he beca -- I became Amalie Salsitz. 
Q: Let me ask you this, before we then go 
onto the duration. Who 
was Amalie Petrenka? 
Who was she as a girl, as a young person,
 and who was Felitsia
 Mewashefsky as a 
person? How did you f
eel about the change? 
A: Fala -- ama -- Amalie Petrenka was a very 
happy go lucky type, with shiny eyes that I 
didn™t know, but they were poi
nted out to me constantly, ev
en during the war. I couldn™t 
carry for a long time, a grudge,
 or hatred. I loved people, 
but Amalie Salsitz was also 
fighter, because she was the middle child, so 
she fought for her righ
ts, because my  older 
sister was only year and a half older than 
I, and th e younger, one year younger. And my  
parents wanted always to keep
 me with my younger sister. 
So I learned to fight for my 
rights. And, little mischievous, rebellious, this 
was Amalie Petrenka. As matter of fact, I 
have done things to big disp
leasure of my parents, because sometimes I questioned their 
judgment. For example, I come from middle 
or above class, and I got -- we -- private

schooling, very expensive. So, wh en my  pare
nts complained about it,
 and they said for 
this money they could have tr
aveled in Europe, I dared to 
tell them I didn™t ask to be 
born. This is not something in Europe, th
at parents appreciate. Felitsia Mewashefsky 
became a very cautious person that -- full of fe
ar, and she played th -- la -- a -- helhole 
lak reeda payatso. Laughing du
ring the day with people, 
the pillow all wet during the 
night. And afraid to face people, still she wa
s exposed every time to
 people. Many times I 
walked with down cast eyes, although as a ch
ild I was told, supposedly, I have very 
beautiful ey es. I used to have very  big one,
 and dark -- the eyelight -- eye white were 
even blue with the fair comp lexion and th e 
fair hair, I guess it was outstanding, and th e 
shiny eyes, like somebody who drinks. Here, 
I was downcast because I was afraid that 
people will recognize me. So, predominant factor
 in me was cautiousness, afraid, fearful, 
and in a way, also I decided I will fight H
itler with [indecipherable]. I will prove to him 
that it is all really nothing, that it™s not tr
ue. I will excel so much, even as a Christian 
Pole, and be admired, to prove
 how false his theory  was, 
which I succeeded. Many cases 
later -- may b e I will tell it i-if you want, later. 
So this was the Amalie
. Still, this Felitsia 
Mewashefsky, if she could -- she c -- just coul
dn™t forget about the 
cultural life. Actually 
it was taboo to -- for Po les -- Christians, to 
go to movie houses, to go to  resort, but 
Felitsia Mewashefsky was able to g -- vent
ure to movie houses, no feedeutsch, no -- 
because I thought I™ll be less caught there. And 
I went -- for example, I have done things, 
like I went to the copanna, wh ich was forbidden 
for Poles, just to pr
ove my point. I felt 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054

also, I play with fire later on. If so, let me
 be caught to -- not only because I w -- am 
Jewish, but I have done things that even 
the Poles were not permitted, the Christians. 
Q: We will speak later about all three of you,
 but especially who Amalie Salsitz became 
in the United States, but for the time being, let™
s talk -- let™s go back a -- or stay with the 

time just before liberation. Wh
at was your state of mind, and what were the events that 
followed? 

A: Just few months befo re the liberation, we
re this first German evacuation. Was a very 
trying time for me because one part of Pola
nd was liberated half
 year before I was 
liberated. I was tempted to run 
over to the Russian side, or 
the Russian -- o-or the la -- 
Jeshuf town oof, and to shorten my  time of 
expectation, meantime I could have been 

killed. But then I decided it™s ve
ry risky, even to run to the 
Russian tine, so I will endure, 
and take my chances to legal -- to be liber
ated here, in Kraków, 
where I survived. And 
also, I was offered, and requested, by my tw
o companies, the firs
t company vi -- m -- 
batonin -- isen bentongbal by 
Wilhelm Langert from Swekow 
saxon, to evacuate with 
him and his comp any. I refused on the grounds 
that I don™t want to 
leave my motherland, 
Poland. And the same thing, first I was al
so requested to evacuate with the second 
company, Myrader and Krauss, the Viennese 
company, to evacute -- or evacuate with 
them to Vienna, and also I refused on the 
grounds that I don™t want to leave my  
motherland. I felt, why to enda
nger on my  life now, towards the end. I didn™t expect the 
terrible anti-Semitism which was 
in Poland after liberation. So
 I decided not to take any 
chances, but to stay put in 
Poland. But nights, I always 
was contemplating if -- what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
6
should I do? What is the right thing to 
do? To run to the Ru
ssian oc -- and now 
conquered, liberated territories. 
A nd one thing, I don™t know if it™s important. Well, I -- I 
learned that I™m a little psychic.
 My dreams towards the end of
 the war were that I meet 
friends. Some friends embraced me, kissed me, 
were very happy to see me. My dearest 
friend, my childhood sw ee -- Ju
lia Logbel, she pushed me away from her all th e time. I 
couldn™t understand this, this was in my  dr
eams. After the war, I found out that the 
people wh o pushed me away, like Alec Lamenstor, for example, my  boyfriend who 

wanted -- we became fiancé, he
 pushed me away, 
they were all killed. Unbelievable. 
People that didn™t survive pu
shed me away. And people wh
o survived, even that there 
was not so closed, and I didn™t think ab out th
em, survived. And I me t them after the war, 
and then I told them, ﬁI knew you were 
alive, because you aka -- embraced me, you 

greeted me.ﬂ So, this was the situation, and -- 
Q: Did you -- did you feel at the time whenyou dreamt it, did you in terpret it then as a 
rejection, or did you interpret it as -- 

A: No, at first rejection. I cried, I -- I felt 
very badly, and I used 
to say, ﬁI didn™t do 
anything wrong, why do you 
push me away?ﬂ Like my  best friend -- no, I didn™t 
rationalize, only later, when  I met, then I unde
rstood th at this was the reason. So this is 
just before the liberation, and naturally I 
had to be double cautious. One way it was easier 
for me, because according to 
my assumed things, and fals
e papers, because I was born 
supposed ly in Vilna, I was safer, because if 
I was caught na -- in -- in this period, first 
thing they checked with
 the parish and police. The pari
sh was already in the Russian 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
7
hands. And, on the police, I had a legitimate 
cancarte made out on the fa -- a-assumed 
name, but they didn™t know it, and the s -- fa
lse baptismal paper. So I was safer in this 
respect, but still I had to be very, very carefu
l. I had many incidents. Like after Myrader 
and hama -- this beton [indecipherable]. I -- 
after they evacuated. So I was referred to 
organization Torte, which built 
the -- you know, [inaudible] th -- th ey built -- to protect, 
you know, ditches, ditches, to protect the ar
mies, and to slow down
 the onslaught of the 
approaching enemy. And my  boss wanted me to
 evacuate with them, too. I refused. But 
there was one employee, an a-accountant. 
He himself looked Jewish too, German, 
ricedeutsch. And he said to me, ﬁFraulein 
Felitsia, what do you ce
lebrate, Sabbat?ﬂ I 
knew he recognized me, natura
lly I play dumb. Was still ve
ry dangerous period for me, 
very dangerous. I -- another one -- when -- 
in the new comp any, a Uk rainian, who 
worked in the bookk
eeping department, turned to anothe
r white Russian, and he said to 
him, ﬁYou know what? I suspect
 that Felitsia Mewashefsky is
 a Jewess.ﬂ And he spoke it 
in front of the wo men with wh
om I lived, who was the daughter -- daughter-in-law of the 
building where the company was located. And 
th e yow -- white Russi
an said, ﬁWhy do 
you go for her life? What did she do to you?ﬂ 
So there were some decent people, but still 
was very dangerous to the last mo ment. 

Q: And then , in a very unexpected  way, 
you met your husband to  be. What -- what 
happened that -- that day? 

A: You see, when I was the secretary of th
e company, Myrader am
-and Krauss, my boss, 
Klammenchitch, who happens be -- was a 
-- a Yugoslavian German, married to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054

daughter of the owner of the My rader Krau
ss do -- Myrader™s daughter, and he -- when 
they were supposed to 
evacuate and I didn™t -- I refused to
 join them, he came over to me, 
and he said, ﬁListen, those are the keys fro
m the safe. We will be back about two thr -- 
three months. Meanti -- you will manage the o
ffice, and you™ll pay out the checks.ﬂ He 
gave me the checks. Then he 
told me, ﬁYou will get some ve
ry important telephone call, 
and cooperate.ﬂ But didn™t explain what will 
be the phone call, from whom. Just after I 
think two or three days, I™m not exact -- so 
sure now, I got a phone call from the camp™s 
commandanten, from Kraków military camp . And 
he ha -- just identify if this is the 
company Myrader and Krauss. I said yavolt.
 And the command came, ﬁSpringen sie de 
zoilen.ﬂ Now, the -- I didn™t know anything about zoilen. I know -- knew only that my  co 

-- the company built bunkers a-ar
ound big office building -- Ge
rman office. And I didn™t 
know -- I saw the pyramids like form on the 
main thoroughfares, but I was not -- I-I-I -- 
informed, and I didn™t know th
at this is the company our bu
ilt, and those are the zoilen, 
but I connected immed iately. Now, I had to
 think very fast. Had I been a German, I 
would have told them that 
they must do it themselves because my  comp any evacuated. 
And then I said, ﬁI can save this city being ru
ined.ﬂ A-And -- not that -- a-after all, it is a 
historic sto -- city, Kraków, but not that all --  all in the Poles, that
 they helped me to 
survive. But still, it is the co
untry where I lived. And I was th
inking also for -- I analyzed 
the danger what will be for me
, not to tell them to do themse
lves, and being I was not the 
only one left in the office. There was -- 
still was the lady Lydia Lu-Lublevska, the 
daughter-in-law. There was -- still was main
tenance men, two chambermaids, and hi --

they didn™t ask me who was speaking, so I thought I am not endange
ring my life, because 
I can always deny receiving the phone call. 
Q: I just want to say for our listeners that th
e Swengsvi zoilen, the translation is dynamite 
the columns. 

A: Detonate. 
Q: Detonate the columns. 
A: And so, after a few days, three man came, 
three knocked ma -- ma -- m --at the gate of 

the build ing wh ere ma  -- [indeci
pherable] where the office 
was, and I told to the m-
maintenance man, I told him, ﬁListen, no
w be a terrible, unsta
ble situation, very 
dangerous, because this is now a German sec
tion, German building. 
People may want to 
come to plunder. They wouldn™t
 know to kill, but definite
ly to plunder. Don™t open the 
iron gate till I will let you know
.ﬂ So when  the three office
rs came, we -- I saw them 
through the window, I told him not to open. 
And th ey knocked -- then  they came again. 

When  they  came again, among them was one o
fficer who looked like a Jew. So I said 
from this quarter cannot be any danger. So 
I will find out what they want, and I will 
explain what it is. So I told th
e man to open the gate, he le
t them in, they came to my 
office, and among th em was my  present husban
d No rman Salsitz. Norman was in -- wi -- 
in a leather coat. Norman look
s very Slavic. And after they ch ecked who we are, they 
dwelt on me, they stop with 
me. And my  husband started, a 
very nasty in -- interrogation. 
Finally, I got very mad. Who I am, I show 
the ID, it™s impossible that I am Felitsia 
Mewashefsky, a Pole, to be a such sensitive job,
 that I™m lying. So I said, ﬁIf -- so take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
10
me to your superiors.ﬂ So he 
toldme, ﬁI am the superior.ﬂ
 And thr-threatened me, and to 
frighten me, he a -- opened his coat where th
e -- his gun was there, a revolver. And I said, 
ﬁFor God sake, it™s towards the end of the wa
r. I don™t have to take anything from such a 
anti-Semite.ﬂ I got annoyed, and I called the o
fficer who looked Jewish to the other room 
that I want to talk to him. In the other r
oom wh en we came, he se -- asked me, ﬁWell, 
who are you?ﬂ I said, ﬁI™m Jewish, I am th
e same that you are.ﬂ 
ﬁHow do you know?ﬂ I 
said, ﬁLook at your face.ﬂ You know, this 
the saying in Europe. So, ﬁFrom where are 
you?ﬂ I said, ﬁFrom Saint Swab of, from where 
are you?ﬂ He said, ﬁI am from Kraków.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁKraków, we had many refugees durin g th
e Russian occupation, and one of them I 
befriended was in my  Jewish gimn asium, by 
the name Oskar Margolies.ﬂ Lo and behold, 
this Oskar Margolies was his first cousin. Fr
om all the people in 
the world, what an 
accountant. Ver -- very emotion from Miskey. Na
turally, he ask about his fate, and then 
we went in. He came over to No rman, and told him to leave me alone, that I™m okay. And 
he whispered that I am Jewish
. Norman didn™t believe till he 
started interrogo
-gated me -- 
interrogating me again, because he knew th
is Yamen Miskey to be a womanizer, he 
thought, God knows. And he -- 
he sta -- th-then somehow, in
 back of his mind, he said 
maybe, maybe she is Jewish. And it was very 
danger -- the situation was not stable to 
reveal that I am Jewish, because in case 
the Russians retreat, th
e G ermans come, then 
they -- I™m exposed as a Jew,
 and they kill me. Oo -- ih
a -- it happened many times. So 
this is one, he decided to be mo re careful. 
He ask if I s -- speak other languages. I said 
yes. ﬁWhat?ﬂ I said, ﬁRussian, German,ﬂ and 
I couldn™t say Hebrew, because I was afraid  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
11
they will understand. So he switch to his br
oken English, as little as he knew, what 
nationality I am. I said  I am Je
wish. He didn™t believe, so he
 started again about Jewish 
religion, and -- and cu stom, and then he aske
d me [inaudible] about the very sacred day 
in our Jewish life, Yom Kippur, the big at
onement day that every Jew knows, and he 
asked me what we say on Yom Kippur. Wh en 
he asked me this que
stion, only a Jew kn-
knows. Then I knew that he is Jew ish, t
oo. I answered immediately Yom Kippur, then, 
with tears from my eyes I said
, ﬁYou too? You too Jewish?ﬂ 
And this is how we met. So 
then we -- but, because we [indecipherable] he 
sa -- I to ld him I speak Hebrew too, and I 
called him names in Hebrew, I did. So  he 
thought being I™m young, that the Germans 
taught me Hebrew in  order I should spy on 
Jews and give them out -- not that I am 
Jewish, because they have done 
it. So they taught me Hebrew 
so perfect in order to fish 
out the poor Jews who were masq uerading as 
Gentile. So then we sw
itched to Polish, and 
then he stated the reason why 
he came. And s -- th -- I said, 
ﬁWhy didn™t you tell me  right 
away? Why did I have to go th rough such  
interrogation, and you know it?ﬂ I was so 
aggrav ated. And so I took him to the office 
across, because the -- those were the living 
quarters, I took him to -- across th e hall, to 
the office, and I gave him the plans of the 
pyramids, of the columns that
 were erected, because there 
was a ma ster plan, so they 
didn™t -- they could deton -- deto nate it. And 
this is how I met Norman. Started with hate. 
He actually came to kill me, and as matter of
 fact, they were disc
ussing who is the one 
who will kill me, because they were afraid after I give the plans I can get in touch with 
the ca -- m-military commandant, and tell them al
ready that they have the plans. A-And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
12
even my husband felt badly beca
use it came upon him to kill, 
and he felt he never killed a 
woman, even if she™s German, 
even all his sisters were kille
d by the Germans, all his gra 
-- nieces and nephews, but still he
 couldn™t bring hims
elf. So this is the story. From 
hatred, for wanted to kill me, 
we fell in love, we got marrie
d, and here we are, married, 
will be in October, 54 years. 
Q: Let™s tal -- [inaudible] just a tiny little bit 
more [inaudible]. Let™s -- let™s sp eak a little 
bit more about what happened th en , though. 
Your -- your courts
hip developed over a 
period of time. He was busy, 
you were doing things
. Ex-Explain a little 
bit more about th-
the time [in d ecipherable] 
A: Actually, mine -- I ha -- this was also so
mething. I was of age, 22, wh en the Polish 
army drafted women to the army. And th
e army was actually under the Communist 
authority, you know, they were
 satellites. And -- and that™s 
why I didn™t want to go. So 
the first thing, I went to -- at that time he
 was Tadoush Szaleski, in
 the high position, and 
I said, ﬁI don™t want to be drafted.ﬂ And, also
 they wanted to expel 
me from this beautiful 
German apartment, an d -- a woman. So he pu
t his name, that he lives there. Then, I 
wanted to  continue with my  studies. I wanted
 to go to medical school, that™s what I 
planned. So, Norm -- it was very hard to get 
into medical school, s -- priority had only th e 
one who started already. So  No
rman, because of high position, was able for me to work  
out, I should be accepted. Because they said
 they had certain num
ber of places for 
students who are Communist. If I will declar
e that I am a Communist, I am accepted. 

And I told Norman, ﬁI never wa
s, I™m not, and for this I will 
not put the ti -- I am in order 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
13
to be accepted.ﬂ But because of his connecti
ons, and high position, I was accepted. But I 
had to go through ast -- extra 
-- you know, old subjects, because I didn™t have any papers. 
I had to take all the exams, [indecipherable]
 from -- to make my matriculation, I was 
accepted. But then, Norman coul
dn™t stay in Kraków becau
se of his position, and he 
traced a lot of Akar, Poles from th e national 
government in London, whose aim was to 
get rid of Germans and Jews, and kill the lot.
 So Norman discovered many, so the ha -- 
the ground was too hot for him. And I was able
 to obta -- obtain for him a transfer to -- 
first to Lipnitsa Breslau, a -- but we didn™t wa
nt to stay in Poland. So I was not busy, my 
-- actually what I occupied myself, I trie
d to help the people who came out from 
concentration camp, in tatters, hungry, star
ving, till it was organized, till they could get 
some help from o -- Jewish organization. So 
Norman supplied for me, 
and I used to go -- 
I used to find them from Plaszów, living in
 one room, four or five, sick, emaciated, 
bringing food, helping. And ot
hers -- and through grapeline 
they found out that I have 
clothes I can give them, and they used to co me. So was mostlal welfare. Not official, but 
wel-welfare. And th en in Breslau, I could 
have enrolled again to medical school, but I 
saw the anti-Semitism in Poland,
 and I felt it™s a Communist 
Poland. I didn™t
 survive the 
war to go from one jail to another. And my on
ly goal and strength to surviv e was to be 
reunited with my family that I had at th
at time in Palestine, from Germany. My 
grandmother, my sister, my mother™s brothers
, cousins, uncles. So th is gave me the 
strength, but I -- because I knew, although I™m
 the sole survivor fro
m the family who was 
in Poland during the Holocaus
t, but I am not an orphan co
mpletely, because I still had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
14
good maternal grandmother and uncles in Pales
tine at th at time, and I will be able to be 
reunited with them. So I felt, 
how can I stay in Po land? Here I endanger my  life, because 
the Poles started the pogroms, killing of Jews
. Personna non grata. 
This is not a reason 
why I survived. And because legally we couldn™
t leave Poland, so we
 escaped illegally to 
Munich. So this is -- otherwise there were gath
erings with struyas -- survivors, and really 
we felt like family, lik e blood relations becaus
e we were -- like Iman n, he lost everybody, 
but didn™t have even a brother, 
anyone. At least I had, they 
didn™t. So we clung to each 
other. We sha -- we looked for solace in each 
other™s arms. So this was till we escaped -- 
till I arranged a escape. First my husband, beca
use my brother-in-lawdecided that he has 
a store, and has to liquidate. So the wife doesn
™t belong to the husband. I had to  stay with 
my older brother-in-law, till he
 liquidates me, then my hus
band escaped. I arranged for 
him. And later we found -- we were supposed
 to meet in the Jewish communion house in 
Munich, but unfortunately, my  husband was not 
there. After I struggled, after I almo st got 
killed crossing illegally the border, because

b eau tifu l, brief mo men t. T h at was th e mo men t 
of liberation. But the 
feelings were more 
complicated for you, 
were they not? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Can you speak a little bit 
more about the liberation, an
d having survived? What did 
that mean to you? 
A: One way, again, I decided I ha
ve to survive, to be
ar witness, in spite
 of Hitler™s theory, 
but when  I found my self liberated, and you 
couldn™t stop and question, wh ere are my  
loved ones? You couldn™t accept it. Why I? Wh
y not my sister, the lovely Celia, 17 ye -- 
years co -- killed. Why not my beautiful mo
ther, 41 years old? Why not my father, 45 
years old? Not speaking ab out my  cousins, unc
les, and not speaking of my  dear friends, 
my childhood friends. So it -- it was a mixed fe
eling, one laced with like guilt, why I -- 
why was I chosen? And then, na
turally, relief, that finally it™s over, and I can be a free 
person, and I can do, and -- and not -- threat 
of death, the Damo cles sword over my  head, 
that was for me since ™41 till ™45. But it was 
not the real joy, not like that you would 
accomplished something very big, b
ecause the price you pay for it. 
Q: How -- how did you decide wh er
e to go, to po -- where to go? 
A: My only stand -- I mentioned 
was the knowledge that I still ha
ve family in Palestine at 
that time. S o  naturally, the choice was I have
 to be reunited with them. But, when it was 
proven, when we escaped
 from -- to Germany, and because of the policy of Great Britain, 
was not permitted to immigrate to Palestine, I di
dn™t want to risk again, and to be caught -
- sent to Cyprus, a-and God kno
ws for how long, and th en to 
Palestine. So I felt all roads 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
16
are leading to Rome. Doesn™t matter which I ta
ke. Being that Jews had an opportunity to  -
- under joint certific -- group ce
rtificate to immigrate to Unite
d States, I decided to take 
what comes first, and then I will go to Pales
tine. What I have done. 
Now, to United States 
is a story I must tell you. We know we cannot 
stay in Germany. Each
 face I scrutinized, I 
couldn™t look -- and it was a terrible emotiona
l -- terrible emotional for me, because 
everyone I looked, is this the k
iller? Is this th e killer of my parents, my family, my sister, 
my  beloved ones? Oh , we knew we cannot stay 
in Germany. We tried to make it as brief 
as possible, but in order to immigrate to Un
ited States, we needed papers to get visa. 
Ironically, the Germans who appl
ied had all the papers, they 
didn™t have any difficulties, 
and they were processed very fast. We surviv
ors, who didn™t have a
ny papers, or the one 
who survived the concentration camp. Or lik
e I, who had to leave everything, any scrap 
of paper which will identify me, and be unde
r assumed, I didn™t, so we couldn™t be 
processed, we couldn™t be -- get -- obtain 
a visa. So finally, my husband and I, we 

decided to  approach the general council, e
xplain the situation, 
what it is, and that 
something mu st be done. Some Jews bribed th
e secretary -- again, who was the secretary? 
A German Christian. And they -- some -- sh e let 
them g o  -- approach   to co -- to present 
it to their ambassador of council. So one 
day, lunch time, we accosted the general 
council, by the name Clark, and we ask him in 
our English, broken Eng
lish, that i-if -- for 
audience, we want to explain so
me situation. After we explai
n to him, he got up, he was 
very tall. He put his hands 
on our heads, and said, ﬁNow, 
set children must come to 
United States.ﬂ He changed the law that it is 
far -- enough if two eye witnesses, notarized, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
17
will give testimony that they know the person, where it ca -- was born and when. And 
this will be accepted. So, in a way, we change
d the law. And we help
ed a lot of survivors 
this way. So finally, when 
our papers came through -- me
antime was very hard for my 
husband too, because -- in the trolley cars
 and the many compiljama
s -- complaints, so 
many -- so many refugees, that th ey brought 
them as slave workers was okay. So my 

husband started fights, fistfights, killi -- you kn
ow, he got bruised, he will not let it go. I 
souta -- so the ground is very hot, we have to
 leave. So luckily, afte
r we got the visa, we 
were sent to the camp -- immigration camp in Br
emenhaven, but we have to stay there for 
half year because in United States was a coal 
strike. So till we be able to leave, it was 
January. 
Q: How did you live during that time? Who -- who gave you food or clothes 

[indecipherable] 
A: Many, many Jews were in DP camps, so Jo
int supported. I somehow avoided camp s, I 
just didn™t want to go to the 
camps. I -- I d -- wasn™t doin 
-- in the camp during the war -- 
I masqueraded, I lived openly, I didn™t. So  we
 lived on our resources. The black market 
was flourishing, so we got cigarettes, we bou
ght fo od, we bought clothing, and this how 
we sustained ourselves. In Munich again, 
many of my  schoolmates who su rviv ed -- ma -- 
not many survived. Many -- I will say, 
five, four, the m -- 
enrolled in UNRRA 
Univ ersity. A -- being I knew I cannot stand in
 Germany, I will not be able with my 
husband. So I didn™t enroll, and when the 
time ca me, we immig r at
ed to United States. 
And from United States, luckily of
 my schooling, I was able to become a Hebrew teacher, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
18
and at ‚49, they had the first chartered pl
ane to Hebrew Univers
ity in Jerusalem for 
Hebrew teachers, to supplement their -- and 
enrich their knowledge in Hebrew. So we 
decided to go to be among them, although we
 didn™t have even still, citizen paper. We 
had only the green pape
rs, we caused a lot of trouble for the whole group, because each 
time we were the -- they were detained becaus
e of us, still they ch
ecked thoroughly, they 
didn™t like it so much. But finally
 -- and this is when we came
, in ™49, to Pala -- Israel 
[indecipherable] was Israel state after the war 
of liberation, where I had the reunion with 
my  sister, my  grandmother, with my  uncles, 
with the whole family, 
and Norman with his 
brother. And, it was a very moving, touching,
 naturally, situation.
 And when I shared 
with them my experience, they  just couldn™t believe such 
atrocity took 
place. They 
thought -- and my sister, who left in ™39, w
ho survived in Palestin
e, marrying palestin -- 
British subject, she thought that I got a nerv ou
s breakdown. She ju 
-- they just couldn™t 
accept. Yes, they knew that my
 mother wa-was killed, but al
so the atrocitie
s, o n ly when 
this was Eichmann trial televised , I got a lo
ng letter from my sister
 Babka, apologizing 
for not understanding, and not being ab le to 
accept or comprehend it. On -- after so many 
witnesses testified, an d she -- now she learne
d that this was true, she felt so guilty, so 
badly. But th is what happened to  us survivors,
 all of them. So the job for the deniers in 
the beginning was easy, be
cause nobody could understand the atrocities.  
Q: I would li -- I™ll come back 
to is -- to Israel again, be
cause I have some follow up 
questions, but let™s go back to the time when
 you arrived. How did 
you go to the United 
States? By boat? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054

A: This is another story, terrible one. W -- 
Joint paid fo r us for passage like any other 
passenger, tourist class, not first class. We 
were women assigned 48 to one cabin, three 
tiers ba -- b u nks. Men were hundred on the 
C deck, like cockroache
s on the floor, on the 
C deck. Germans who got pape
rs got second class and firs
t rate accommodation. First 
class not the same  mo ney, but the others, they
 were just assigned a family to a cabin. 
Norman, my  husband, got
 very, very sick, seasickness. It
 was very rough weather, this 
was 14 days in the crossing. So, after three 
days, when  he was comp letely dehydirted -- 
dehydrated, I decided to dress him up as a woma
n. I gave him a scarf, and a dress, and I 
arranged with another su
rvivor that I will give him my bun
k, and I will sleep with her. As 
a matter of fact, she is here, United Stat
es. And her name was Zwotorilka Zwotto. So 
when they checked 
the cabins, if there is not socializ
ing, because we were not permitted 
with our -- to be with our s
pouses, like the Germans. We were women separated. So -- in 
different even dining room. So there was a 
woman with a scarf, and they didn™t know. 
This how we passed. Tor -- as a matter -- he 
wished he should -- de
ath upon him. After 
what you went through, s -- he was so seasick.
 But the last day, when we s -- were told 
that we are approaching the Statue of Liberty, and -- New York
 harbor, natural we 
dressed up all in our best, and we went on 
the deck. And this was some mo ment, seeing 
the Statue of Liberty, the torch, the liberty. 
Ah -- we were elated, fin ally we are liberated. 
We came -- we arrived, we didn™t have to go
 to Ellis Island, becaus
e at that time they 
checked us in Germany, in th
e special office of immigration,
 and wh en we arrived at the 
pier, they grouped us according to the alphabe
t. Staying there under the S, Salsitz, a guy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
20
in lumberjacket comes -- appr
oaches me again, and asks 
me if I know a family sal -- 
Salishitz, he™s supposed to come. I said, ﬁW
e are Salishitz.ﬂ It was Norman™s second 
cousin. Being he had an [ind
ecipherable] across this pier, 
he knew everybody, and he got 
the permission to enter, and to be the firs
t one who greeted us, and outside was waiting 
Norman™s brother Al, who immigrated the ye
ar when Norman was born, i -- to United 
States, and his family was very emotional, a
nd very warm, and this 
brother took us to his 
house. Well, we stated  for a month, I think,
 till we got our apartment. But about a house, 
another story. In my  dreams -- it™s unbelieva
ble, I never thought about United States, 
because my whole family in Palestine, and I th
ought that after libera
tion, we™ll go straight 
there. I saw a red brick house. I never had seen
 such style of house in
 my town in Poland. 
When  we approached  the house in Brookl
yn, tomor -- in Flatbush, where Norman™s 
brother Al lived, this was the house. And I to
o -- pointed to him. He said, ﬁHow do you 
know?ﬂ I said, ﬁI saw it in my 
dreams.ﬂ I never thought -- I 
had never been -- and, like I 
said, I never thought after liberatio n that I will 
be in United States. So we stayed with him 
for a month, then by coincident, traveling 
on th e subway, we were approached  by th e old 
-- elder man Italia. His name was Rosario. W
ith broken English he 
asked us who are we, 
and so. And we told  him that we are surv
ivors, refugees, and we are looking for 

apartment. He offered his apar
tment -- he was by 72 years old. He said he never became a 
citizen. His wife and family are 
still in Italy, and he sa -- de
cided now to reun -- to reunite 
with them, so he offered his ap artment for nothing, rent-free, so long he stay still, to share 

with us. And this how we got 
the first apartment, where also
 Norman™s cousin lived, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
21
the daughter. And th e cousin , it™s by coinciden
ce you -- she came -- she was a widow, she 
was brought by this cousin who -- the lumber
jacket -- Jack Rodbot 
at the pier. She was 
brought over very -- she was a widow. Very 
nice woman, and she taught me how to  cook. 
Her daughter Regina offered -- found for me 
the first job, and fo
r Norman. For Norman 
he wo r -- walked to the ink comp any th at he 
hated. It™s was physical, and he thought he 
will get crazy, because didn™t absorb -- his mi
nd had to be busy, esp
ecially a big shot in 
Poland after the war, here he™s mixing ink wi
th another two black me
n, he thought he will 
get crazy. And she got me a job in the tie fact
ory. Bu t I had to sit with my  head down, 
and m -- probably not nourish e
nough, my  blood used to come
 I -- from my nose all the 
time. On top of it, she said I even don™t ma
ke minimu m quota of ties. She said, ﬁLook, I 
would like to keep you.
ﬂ She was a German refuge. So I quit the job. And I said, ﬁFor 
God™s sake, my parents spent so much mone
y on my  Hebrew education. I™m a qualified 

teacher, why not look in this field?ﬂ And this ho
w I got a job, half year later, in the first 
Hebrew school, in -- on Av enue P, Magen Da
vide. And then I switched to another one, 
which was a very religious school for boys in
 Borapart ats haim. And this how star -- I 
started on my career as a teacher, which I just
 quit 15 years ago. And I was doing -- and 
very happy, and quite successf
ul, because for 10 years, I di
dn™t have any children. My 
whole love to children went to my schoolch  
-- pupils, and they felt 
it. Children feel it. 
And they reciprocated. It was a beautiful relati
onship. As a matter of fact, I was able to 
handle the hardest cases the principal ga
ve me. I think because of my  love and 
understanding. They  used to wait for me after 
la -- lessons, to talk to me. And they had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
22
problems, because this was the 
time the divorces. It affected 
very much the children, and 
they talked to me about it, and I patiently
 listened. I had cases where the student from 
first grade ask me if I will wait for him, he
 gets older, he wants to marry me. You know 
the stories. And waiting -- walking me to 
school. It was really love. My chil -- my 
daughter was born -- 
Q: Did you want -- had -- 
did you want children?  
A: In the beginning, no. I was not ready. In
 the beginning, I felt what will I teach my 
child. She will ask me about he
r grandparents, everything. To
 lie I didn™t want. They 
didn™t die, they were killed. Teach your child
. When it™s three, starts
 asking kill, who? By 
Hitler, cruel man. Where is God? God is our 
father. Why did he pe
rmit it? Why didn™t he 
protect us? Which, later, I encountered. So
 I didn™t want that. I was not emotionally 
ready, I didn™t want. But then
 when, finally, I decided I di
d -- I think it was by three or 
four years after the war, we decided to have a 
child. So it didn™t come as we wanted. As a 
matter of fact, it took us ta -- our daughter 
was born to  our 11th an niversary. Meantime, 
we want to adopt. We were refused, beca
use medically we were 
found able to have 
children. And when  we couldn
™t even if -- we approached
 the black market. The same 
time I was pregnant three months with my  
daughter, I got a phone call from Philadelphia 
that they have a baby girl fo
r our adopt. But naturally, I didn™t accept it. First of all, I 
said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
23
what right do I have to  do it? Another parent
 who cannot have a ch ild, and I am having. 
And what will do to raise two children, one mine, and no -- will have to be mine. So I 
declined, and th is is when my  daughter
 was born, and then we had problems. 
Q: Yeah, I wi -- I will make that connection 
to -- to the problems. One more question. 

Were people in America at that time ready 
to hear about your ex
periences, and did you 
want to talk about them? 

A: No, the people were not ready, they didn™
t want. They felt guilty for number of years, 

Jews, and non-Jews. Jews were also compla
ining that they  had had ration card, they 
suffered. They didn™t have e
nough meat and sugar. And they
 felt guilty that they didn™t 
do too mu ch . Th -- like the black people marc
hes to Washington and everything? No t. 
There was only one group, the 
very Orthodox Jews, and they
 saved some Jews. So they 
didn™t want to hear about it. 
Norman was ready to talk about 
it all the time. I saw the lack 
of understanding in  the first years, so I deci
ded what to waste my time, and emotional to 

open my wounds all the time, I 
decided to wait, when it™s ri
ght. But in school I had to 
because they started teaching a
bout the Holocaust, but you s -- 
Q: When was this? 

A: In school that they started to teach? I 
think ™50, ™51, ™52. A
nd also, when -- you see 
now how I get emotional. So I used to cry. 
I didn™t want to, I couldn™t control. So I 
reduce as much as possible [indecipherable] I 
talked. So then did we
 decided after all -- 
and Norman spoke and told a
ll the time. And so are -- w e decided we have to write a 
book, because after all, why did we survive, 
if not to bear witne
ss for the victims? We 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
24
mu st share our experien ce. And naturally th
ere was -- th ey crept up, the deniers, the 
revisionists. So we said, if we will not do an
ything about it, they w
ill win. So this where 
we started. Now, we had bad experiences, 
too. Not so much I, 
like Norman. You know 
when  you among educated people, profession
al people, you accepted . And it doesn™t 
matter. Like you, it doesn™t ma
tter if you have a accent or not, you™re accepted. But wh en  
you go -- first he was a peddler -- lower cla
ss, blue collar. Why did you su rviv e? How 
comes you -- you are alive? Why aren™t you 
ne -- any misunderstanding, anything, why 
weren™t you not gassed? You k
now how painful it was? So he went through a lot. As a 

matter of fact, in the beginning, he wanted
 even to commit suicid
e. He just couldn™t 
accept. The family was not warm either. Again,
 I was lucky. I had only here a fa -- my 
father™s brother™s family. The ol
dest one, from Berlin, they left in ™38, the last ship. And I 
was received beautiful, till today. My aunt
 -- although her husband was -- she was 
divorced from him, she took me in like a child, and she made sure that her children 

accepted me as a child of the 
family. There was not Friday 
dinner, any holiday, that she 
didn™t include. So much that her har -- son 
Leor, who graduated in  
Berlin, but he went 
here to Columbia, he was -- he is a artist, co
mmercial artist, he was later director very big 
com -- advertising company, Beore. He was si
ngle. On every date, he
 took Norman and I. 
He™s the one who took us all ove
r, any concert. Tavern on the Green, to Carneg ie Hall, 
Radio City, explained the architecture. Beautif
ul, felt family. On my
 mother™s side, my 
grandmother™s -- Rifk a Genga™s sister, Esther
 Inglestein, when sh e found out we don™t 
have any religious wedding, to her it™s blas
phemy , sin. We lived in sin. She made the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
25
wedding in her apartment, by t -- she invite
d about 20 people. The rabbi was a cousin 
who officiated, and her oldest
 son Harold, till today, now he
™s 89 -- there was, when his 
wife was even alive, Doris,
 she was for -- she immigrated from Vienna, actual -- re-
refugee -- oh, it was in ™38, like family, agai
n. A-Any family gathering, any holiday. So  
we had a home. Norman had a tremendous fam
ily here. Only the poor 
uncle, his father™s 
brother, Uncle Shulamoon, he is the one wh o 
cared, who wanted the vano -- to get the 
job, to find a job for Norman, was always in
 touch, was very warm. But his children, and 
so many others, they didn™t even  invite us 
for dinner. Only later on, when we became 
successful, suddenly  we got phone calls
. So No rman was very disappointed. 
Q: How did you feel -- di
d you get -- did you try to get help
, or to talk to somebody else 
about it? It sounds as if 
you two were really just -- 
A: No. 
Q: How did you help  No rman with 
his feelings about [indecipherable] 
A: We survivors. This is why we kept -- we
 were very co mfortable only with su rvivors. 
They -- the Americans didn™t want us, we 
didn™t care for them
, because they didn™t 
understand us, it was waste of time . Very supe
rficial. We couldn™t get used to it, hi, how 
are you, and running, even not waiting for the 
answer. And I love you superficially, killed 
us. We were the most comfortable with su
rvivors. As a matter 
of fact, when from 
Brooklyn we moved to New Jersey, I met a 
friend in the mountains, Viennese refugee, 
Edith Geller, happens we were in the same h o te
l. We befriended, we became like sisters. 
Very comfortable. I moved he
re. Only two families were of
 survivors, the rest all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
26
Americans, God knows how many generations, 
Jews, and non-Jews, they are the same. I 
moved here because I taught not far from here
, so -- and I wanted also -- we wanted a 
community where everybody™s st arts from beginning, not [i
ndecipherable] anybody asks 
from where did you come. The -- 
Q: Where™s here? Here is -- 
A: Springfield. Because they came from Newa
rk, and Elizabeth, a
ll over, so everybody 
was new, not only we. We started. But whom
 did we befriend? There was a pediatrician, 
a survivor. She was my age, ag
ain we were like sisters. We loved each other so  mu ch. 
She was only 39 when she died . She got cancer on the breasts,
 she had two little children. 
She just built up her practice,
 and it spread all over. On  
her dying bed, one in the 
morning, my -- her husband called me to come 
to the hospital. She was in a tent. She was 
in coma, but she was very restless. I came
. I said, ﬁIt™s Manya. Everything okay.ﬂ She 
held my  hand. She quiet down, and she died . Bu
t that -- you see, we have very  intensive 
feeling, or we like, or we don™t care. We ju
st don™t go for acquaintances, we don™t care. 
And there was another family that -- also 
survivors, Gershwin. From Mamil and from 
Wachau, we befriended. Later, we moved in 
more -- I th ink by -- we are now by eight 
survivors family. Some [indecipherable] out, but
 the closest relationship, w-we have. And 

also, we survivor, we get toge
ther. It™s like family. As a ma
tter of fact, it was very hard 
on my child, because
 she wanted happier people. She wa
s tired already. 
She didn™t know 
how to cope about killing, surv
iving, everybody sh aring thei
r experience. So she adopted 
other gran dparents from my  neighbor, who th
e grandparents were born already in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
27
States. And they died  now, they  would be no
w a hundred years old, her best friends. And 
when she got married, I guess also
 the selecti on was she didn™t 
want the child of survivor. 
She met -- her husband is fifth generati
on American Jew. Family, family, she 
[indecipherable] Norman. 
Q: When  did you -- when did 
you start talking to her? 
A: It -- unfortunately too early. Not I. My
 husband. I warned 
him. Okay, she ask 
question, naturally, why -- wh ere are my  gr
andparents? Every week
end  grandparents 
coming, everybody showered with love, with 
toys, where are mine? So, I had to tell her. 
And it was hard for her to accept, poor child. 
And so the only relief wa
s -- this is why we 
traveled so often to Israel, because th
ere was my siste r. No, she never met my  
grandmother, she was born after my  grandmot
her died. But my sister and family. So 
when my sister™s children 
said, ﬁLet™s go to grandma.ﬂ Because they had their 
grandmother on patern al side, who immigrated wh
en  my  brother-in-law, in ™35, or ™34 to 
Israel. She said, ﬁWe don™t have any grandp
arents. Why do you sa
y grandma?ﬂ So I had 
to explain her, she was a child
, that there™s two parts, fa
ther and so. And we took her 
there to kindergarten, and we wanted her to
 get the real w armth from uncle, and -- and 
from cousins, and so sh e suffered very much.

a little bit more about what did you expect, what was your 
dream? Your family was Zionist, it was your dr
eam to go there. What did you expect, and 
what did you see? What were the different -- 
what was different, the expectations, what -- 
in what shape was the coun
try, how were survivors pe
rceived, how did you feel? 
A: How the survivors were received, I don™
t know, because I came from United States. I 
only know what I heard from some, and wh at I 
read in the press. And so I wouldn™t like 
discuss because it™s hearsay and people [ind
ecipherable] from the press themselves. 
Q: But you as a surv
ivor, how were you -- 
A: But it™s different, because I was from th
e UnitedStates, and 
I didn™t deprive the 
Israelis from their income, what
 they felt any newcomer does.
 It™s a big difference. And 
so I will not speak, because 
my family, naturally, was very happy. Why it was happy? 
Well, the reunu-ion was in ™49. We came with th
e tour to settle, this what was our aim, in 
Israel. We are happy, it™s finally a state, a
nd finally we have someplace to go wh en they  
chase us out, not like n-no door was open fo r 
us, even you know, the 
big boat that they 
sent back, and not one, only how my  uncle was saying, and he was on th e Struma, and 

you know, Saint Louis, and all 
this. So finally, we felt we a nation, we have home. If God 
forbid one country d
ecides to persecute the Jews -- I™m n o t talking already about 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
29
genocide, but this a safe haven where Jews ca
n run and go. Now, when we came in ™49, 
and we expressed our desire to settle, this 
was the time the country was very, very poor. 
And they didn™t have -- really each citizen, ea
ch took away from th
e other. So my uncle, 
especially the oldest brother of my mo ther, 
Max Gengar, childless, he said to me -- and 
he was quite well off, be -- he came there in  
1922, he had -- 1919. Then ™22 he had to 
escape because he was kill -- an 
Arab wanted to kill him, he 
killed him, so he escaped to 
Germany, back to his brothers. He advised 
us, he said, ﬁYou are very young.ﬂ At that 
time, ™49, so I was 27, and my  husband was 
29. He said, ﬁYou young
, you have to start 
your life. Why don™t you start it really, in 
United States, where the possibilities are better, 
and larger, and you will be able
 to help us out in Israel.ﬂ 
And this what we accepted, and 
I must say modestly, humbly, we
 have done it. My sister, wh
o struggled terribly, we are 
able to send her children to a univer -- give education, because in Israel is only 
mandatory I think five or six gr
ades, and then we are able to 
pay for their studies for high 
school. And naturally all s -- a
ll the necessities. My sister liv
ed on the farm with children, 
primitive. We  bought -- I di
dn™t have at that time a Frig
idaire, I had the icebox in 
Brooklyn, and a -- Frigidaire, she had two childr
en, I sent a washing ma
chine, just to help 
her out, because again, she came from
 such a very comforta -- [ringing] 
Q: The telephone. 

A: But we could let -- 
Q: Do you want -- 

A: Yeah, we couldn™t -- I couldn™t have it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
30
Q: Okay , let -- let™s stop for a second. 
A: And I will take it off. 
Q: Yes, mm-hm. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay , continue. 
A: So -- so we decided this wh
at we have done, and we were 
able to help with a wedding, 
with everything. And you know, if they were in [indeciphe
rable] village, so they didn™t 
get any money. They  needed  a house, they  need
ed to buy. We were 
able to help her. And 
especially 10 years we didn™t ha
ve any children, and I had a steady job as a teacher, and I 
got -- I was very well paid for the times. Norman
 was able, because of my salary later, to 
quit the job in the ink factory, and he went in
to peddling, on installment. He went to the 
Polish section, which was here 
in New Jersey, Jersey City. 
And he looks like a Pole, and 
they thought he is Polish
, and Norman doesn™t wear 
a wedding band, probably you 
noticed, so he was single, on the market. An
y woman who wanted, really, thought she has 
chances with him, this is Norman
. So this is the story. So he
 got customers, and he started 
making money, and I with my  teaching, we -- a
nd then , he started very
 small items, then 
naturally he gained confiden
ce from people, he was able -- lately he selled new -- to 
newlywed s, furnished them, everything. He 
[indecipherab le]. But then he had en ough, 
and he switch, he decided now -- real estate
, build ing development wa
s flourishing, so he 
decided to  switch into this field, but natura
lly he didn™t know anything ab out it, like he 
didn™t know about -- anything about fu rnishing 
people, too. So nights 
he went to school 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
31
to learn to be a decorator, and here he -- being now he had the capital, so he took in  a 
German -- an Italian builder. The builder didn™t
 have any money, but he taught him, and 
they worked together. So
 this how he learned. He started,
 and he flourished, he built. And 
it™s first few houses, th
en bigger, and so on. 
Q: Before we go, we stay in
 the United States and -- and ta
lk a lit-little 
bit more about 
your life, then I will have one more question w
ith regard to Israel. D id you feel Jewish in 
a special way, in a different way than 
you had befo re enteri
ng the United States? 
A: No comparison. Here I am among mine. 
I am not a minority. Do  you n -- I -- no one 
who didn™t go th rough it doesn™t 
understand the feeling to be a minority, and be picked, 
always sacrificial lamb  for anything goes 
wrong. Here I among -- I™
m e-equal to others. 
And this such a wonderful feeling. I -- and 
so proud, and especially I was privileged to 
watch the development of this 
county since ™49. At least ev
ery two years we were there, 
from the very hard times, economically how th e county built up, and physically from the 

desert how cities flourished and built up. And 
how people really, also
, were able to live 
differently, and the culture. One thing is al
ways very nice, high standard, how people 
were informed, well-read, and in
 the pleasure to discuss with
 them. And there™s a pride, 
pride to be among people equal -- intellectual 
people, very bright people. Even they are 
algart. But this is the thing, the characteri
stic of the Jews. And -- and pushy, because 
otherwise they wouldn™t survive.
 But you accept it, but you ar
e proud what you see, what 
they achieved. And anybody tries to down tr
od, even when the state was proclaimed, you 
know, the American wanted to act
ually is -- dissolve it, and to
 say  Israel stop, you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
32
to exist, you know, because of the Arabs. 
And oil, do -- we su
rrounded with Arabs, 
always the danger. They wanted to throw, and 
still want to throw it to the sea. So there is 
a feeling -- I feel responsible. I remember 
when the Six Day War was, how I cried. I 
wanted to  bring all the children, because of 
security. I was afraid, 
so  man y  armi es, wh at 
will happen? They will squash, 
they will kill. So I had wanted to save the children at 
least, but thank God, it was very successful
. Then the Yom Kippur
 War, I lived through 
it, okay? I share the fate of the Israelis. Ever
y election, every news. It
™s very important to 
me, the security of
 the country.  
Q: How do you feel then, and that is 
the last q u estion, but it™s an important 
[indecipherable] how do you feel
 then about right now the situ
ation, what with the peace 
negotiations, they -- the direction taken? 
A: I am not happy because I don™t trust. I beli
eve what Arafat said, what he says to the 
Arabs. It™s a piecemeal. He wants part, whatev
er he can get it, without the war, then he 
will be strong, and he feels he -- he wants really
, to erase this -- the state of Israel. He will 
do a favor, he will permit some Jews to stay, 
maybe. And this scares me, very much so. 
And the pressure from the world, 
in order to appease this oil, 
the Arab oil, the Saudi oil, 
the pressure they put on Israel to make conc
essions, when they know
 that the concessions 
endanger the security of the land, 
yes. I am very unhappy about it. 
Q: Let™s go to America then, and let me
 ask you th is. Do you remember -- not th e 
mo ment, of course, but -- but sort of the tim
e when  you began to feel comfortable with 
your identity as Americans, and what di
d that mean to you, to be American? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
33
A: Who doesn™t like to have a rich father, 
who doesn™t like to be from something very  
successful like United States? And not always 
I™m so proud, because 
I am still critical. I 
lo -- don™t like the bully. I am 
very unhappy now with  the situ
ation with Kosovo, not that 
[indecipherable] had to be stopped, but defi
nitely not by bombs, not
 by breaking sovanti 
of a county. I don™t like it. And I™m afraid 
it may backfire, because now this is the 
biggest, strongest bully in th
e world, and if the Ru ssians are pushed too hard  -- they don™t 
have the means now, but they still have atom
 -- nuclear, and if they are pushed too much, 
and knowing the Russians, they
 will never forgive it -- United States, how it was treated. 
Now, with NATO, and entering 
s -- Yugoslavia, Serbs, and ev
erything, I am afraid that 
may backfire. I learned history repeats 
himse -- itself. L o ok the Roman empire, 
Hellenistic empire, Britain, the big ones. Th
ey reach the peak, and 
then it goes down. I 
will not live to see, and I hope my child
ren and grandchildre
n will not live, but 
unfortunately, this is how hist
ory is. And we shouldn™t pay 
for the mistakes w e making. 
Hurts me that we Americans are not to 
like around the world,
 because we bully 
everybody. This hurts me, becaus
e really, it™s the only democrac
y, not the best, but is the 
best comparing to others, and the opport
unities and the freedom, it gives everybody, 
according to abilities. The only th
ing really what a newcomer 
cannot be is a president. 
But take Kissinger, take others. 
If you™re just capable -- take 
us. After all, with no help 
from anybody, we are very comf
ortable. All the doors -- I must say almost all the doors 
were open to us. Ok ay, my  was Jewish educ
ation, my  husband was self-emp loyed. No  
doors closed. I see my son-in-law, brilliant, he 
was accepted to Harvar
d, he is working, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
34
he is on staff of Harvard Ho spital. My dau
ghter is a lawyer. She could have been  the 
biggest one if she wanted. The doors are open,
 according to your ability. It™s -- now they 
start little b it a quota, but it wasn™t a quo -- 
when I came was still the quota, Norman™s 
nephew was a quota, because th
en, when he wanted to  go, 
I remember, he was accepted 
to -- to Columbia, and there 
was a quota, but no more. Now 
they start little bit, but it™s 
very high position, I am very proud ag ain, 
how many Jews achieved 
very high positions 
now. They couldn™t before. And so I am pr
oud that -- watching th e progress. I™m proud 
that I am a country which is not contro lled by 
the church, and this why I wi -- we selected 
to come here, not to Latin America. Why I 
mentioned la -- South America, because argen 
-- Argentina was my bro -- father™s brother, 
who immigrated from Stanislawow in ™28, 
and he was quite well off, establish ed. Unfort
unately, when I came to United States, a 
year later he died, age 45 on
 cancer of stomach. But he 
wanted to  bring us over to 
Argentina, and I said, ﬁNevermore I go to a co
untry, especially a Catholic country, and 
contro lled by th e church.ﬂ And th
ank God, here is the country,
 if I don™t like I can speak 
up. And if anybody tells me -- lik e, I had 
the neighbor here, German descendent, Mr. 
Spiegel, Charlie. And once our 
dogs had fight when  I had the dog. He said, ﬁYou Jew, 
you go to  Palestine.ﬂ And I said, ﬁYou Germ
an, go to Germany.ﬂ So everybody came 
from someplace, doesn ™t matter if you was born
 here. The only rea
lly Americans are the 
Indian s, so it™s a wonderful feeling. You™re
 not afraid to speak 
up. And if somebody 
insults you, you™re just free to fight back. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
35
Q: I have a few other questions, but it seem
s to be the mo ment to ask you -- we had 
talked about Amalie Petrenka in the begi
nning, who she was. We had talked about 
Felitsia Mewashefsky. Now we are talking w
ho is Amalie Salsitz. 
Is that who you are 
then? 
A: Yeah. The only question I have to know, 
Amalie Salsitz, now pr
esently a old woman, 
who retired, who lives just to -- for pleasant th
ings, to -- as much as she can take out of 

life, or the Amalie who came, because of th
ere™s a big difference.
 The one who arrived 
had to est -- had to establish herself. Wit
hout no help  from anybody. So  she had to be 
aggressive. She felt satify -- satisfied, acco
mplished, because in her profession she was 
very happy. As a mo ther having a daughter, 
a good daughter, the relationship was nice. 
There was some, like daughter mo
ther missed, but straight in th e time of the drugs, my  
daughter was not. She was in Boston, ag e 17
, she graduated earlier. She became a lawyer. 
I™m happy, successful, and there™s respect. I am
 not a very active person. I love -- I™m a 
very private person, luckily, b
ecause Norman has to be at every organization, at every 
meeting, but not only to  be a member -- a me mber, a paid member I am also. B™Nai Brith, 
Hadassah, Sisterhood. But I don™t -- I come
 very seldom, unless it™s something very 
important. Otherwise I prefer my  privacy, my  book I enjoy immensely, I lose my self. I 
like the privacy, also maybe -- 
maybe there™s the reaction to 
the war time, when I didn™t 
have a private corner where I could be myself, 
and I realized this is why I™m such need of 
privacy. Like so many, especially
 women, like to dine in the 
restaurants, and this is the 
biggest thing, go away for a 
weekend. I like my meals when I cook, not that I am such a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
36
good cook, and not that I l
ove to cook. Bu t I have my  home. Because during the war 
again, I only had eat with the ration card, ma
squerading as a Gentile. In the restaurant, 
bring the potato in the rest
aurant, and I longed for a 
cook -- home-cooked meal. I 
reme mb er when  my  landlady was making her s
oup, th e aroma, the fragrance, and I ask, 
my goodness, will it be time when I will be ab le to make my own soup, my own tea? This 
probably shaped me. So till now, 
like I said, I like the privacy. I like people very much, 
but I™m as happy when I™m by myself. It™s n o
t that I have to be beneath. Ag ain, like 
Norman functions the best, he™s a ham when 
there™s a lot of people. When  he doesn™t 
have a big group, at least four
 people listeners, he likes to sulk little bit, and sul -- and 
really y-you wouldn™t believe the joker, the st oryteller than can be so  quiet, that home 
you have to pry out fro
m h i m a se n t en ce. Bu t mo st co me d i
ans are that way, I heard from 
other wo men too, th at they™re 
so good when they
 entertain, but home they don™t open 
their mouth. So -- and -- but I 
am content. I love to be w
ith my family. 
Naturally, with 
my  daughter means the whole world to me. My
 grandsons. And ev en I have relationship 
from the beginning with  my  cousin Petrenka. 
He is now 70, and he™s
 a year and a half 
older than I am. As much as we
 can, we spend holidays together
 -- together. It™s harder to 
travel. And also with my friends still from 
home, I™m still in touch,
 whoever is alive. 
They  moved now, many of them to Florid a,
 because they™re old. Some are older. One -- 
one is 89, wa -- or 80. I have only my friend, 
to -- two that are my ag
e. Mostly they were 
in the woods, they were married.
 But we in touch, and again,
 it™s like family. And on the 
phone, I -- I don™t like to call 
too mu ch. I told -- I think I mentioned to you. I don™t have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
37
the patience to talk too much 
on the phone, but I will call to
 check how they are doing. I 
like celebrations. You know, at to -- attend when
 sp -- especially fro
m family. It means a 
lot to me. Like se -- Thanksgiving, on my  
daughter, or my  cousin Leo Petrenka™s 
daughter, she makes it, Joyce, in her house, 
means a lot to me. I don™t like big gatherings 
when  the people are strange. Like my  daughter
 ha -- Norman likes a lot of people. And 
when we go there for Passove
r, she has at least 32 people. 
So it means -- we are only by 
seven family, the rest are friends. I don™t mi
nd close friends, 15 people, but the friends 
bring -- but she invites with their parents, 
total strangers. And I feel a celebration of 
holiday, I want with close people. So I sto
pped going, and I gave
 a ultimatum. All you 
make for family. I™d rather go 
to  Joyce here in Long Island. 
I don™t want to come holiday 
and meet a lot of strange people. And this 
is how to celebrate. But remarkably, and 
astonishly, I read in the Jewl
son Post that the survivors as
 in Israel, was an article 
complain about the same thing.
 When they go to celebrate fa mily with family, there is no 
family, because so ma ny, and th ey are not to
o com -- not comfortable, but not so happy. 
They want the warmth. We are missing, l
acking the warmth, family warmth. And -- 
Q: I would just like to say in between, that
 we are getting a little bit wind against the 
microphone, but Amalie needs the -- the air 
coming th rough the window to -- to keep 
speaking, and to  be comfortable, so we™ll ju
st stay here, and now 
and then th is little funny 
sound is simply the wind throu
gh the window. And it™s very hot. I just want our listeners 
to know that. And I do have 
-- I interrupted you. Would y
ou -- would you continue, or I 
have another question I will ask. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
38
A: Go ahead. And I covered it. 
Q: Yeah. Okay. 
A: So you heard I like to read
 very much. I like theater. Like
, for example, S-Sunday we 
are going to see, The Gathering,
 with Theodore Bickel. It™s 
excellent. Few years ago, just 

few years, there was not a Broadway show. 
But only drama, or mu sical, I don™t go for 
comedy too mu ch. On th e way to  [indecipherab
le] all this. I don™t go. I go for drama, or 
musical that we didn™t see. 
Q: What kind of 
books do you like? 
A: I like -- first of all are historical biographi
es, historical books. Biographies, there is not 
book on Holocaust that I didn™
t read, although they say we s
houldn™t do it, but I am like a 
drunkard who goes to the closet
 with the bottles. I have to 
read every one. And -- but I 
don™t care so much just novels. I do from time to time, but most of my books, I will show 
you, are historical. This how I learned ab ou
t American history, because when  I learned 
English, I was taught about the British Engl
ish -- history, but not the American. So 
actually, I filled up the gap, not taking a cour
se in college, but by reading historical 
biographies. And I like -- also I lik e very mu
ch  gard ening, and naturally I am exercise 
fan. I -- every day -- every day religiously, 
oh of -- regardless of weather, I walk for a 
half hour. By the way, my  doctors now, my  
age, compliment me ve
ry much, because I™m 
not exactly a healthy person. Blood pressure, 
and -- and I have a high cholesterol, and I 
have an enlarged heart, and I have all -- that is
 set. If not that I walk every day, I wouldn™t 
be alive. My arteries would be clogged, and al
so my  density of bone is not so bad for the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
39
age. It is naturally -- I have osteoporize, be
cause anyone in the age, but according to my 
age, it™s not bad, because of the walk. I 
like to exercise, I like to walk, but most 
important, I mu st have a lot of fresh air. I ca
nnot be cooped up, I™m like a fish without 
water. Even in wintertime. I got [indecipherable
] I fall, it™s slippery, but I walk. You see, 
I cannot be in close p-place, like we wa -- we
 -- we like to go -- we go fo r cruises, but I 
had to cut out, because it™s not properly ven
tilated, and I come home with infection in my 
bronchial tubes. So  the price is too high. 
So I always have a open window, even in 
wintertime, next to my bed, then I can br
eathe. But I help myself.. And like any woman 
in the golden age, I do
n™t complain, I get up. And still I li
ve longer than my mother, 41. I 
always look like this. And my
 father, my sister 17. So, after the war, every year was 
given to me. Every birthday, I appreciate it.
 B ecause -- and how long for a survivor, 
where I starved, where I got boils, because af
ter the war, I didn™t have cultume enough, 
and ev erything. I don™t comp lain. I™m functioning well. 
Q: And you still speak out, too, and I have a 
question about that. You have written books, 
and we™ll talk about that
 a little bit more, too. You have sp
oken out a lot, 
and in public -- 
in schools, I believe, too. Is it difficult some
times, because in a sense it keeps the wo und 
open all the time, or is that necessa
ry to -- to keep healing, to -- 
A: It™s both. It™s both. We have the obliga
tion to talk, like I mentioned. With  high blood 
pressure -- if you™re really curious, I™ll meas
ure, if I don™t have now 200 and so. Costs me 
a lot, you know, health-wise. I red u ced it,
 yes. I don™t accept. Norman still goes. I 
comp liment -- I congratulate him,  I admire him 
for this. He speaks. It takes too mu ch out 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
40
of me. As -- now I decline many, because
 unless it™s important like something for 
Holocaust Museum to commentary. Or when we
 had last year one of the driv e for the 
pennies for the Righteous Pe
ople. There were so many interviews, any ch annel on 
television, CNN, amen 33, CNN, eight, 13, 12,
 whatever you want, 11, all was. I had to. 
But also, before was so many. F -- lem -- al
l organizations, I felt I h ad to. But now, like 
for example, they wanted us to come out 
to Louisv ille, Kentucky, we declined. I don™t 
know if Norman told you, we got letters, be
cause the teacher made them read our book. 
As much as tha -- they read onl
y the part about Norman, they 
divided, and then they ask, 
and the letters were beautiful, but we c
ouldn™t go. We invited, February the 29
th
, from 
Georgetown University, to spea
k about Holocaust. It™s a big i
f. I don™t know if I will be 
able to go, health wise. So, but 
still we have to do it. We have
 to do so long
 we can bear 
witness, and give testimony, because we
 always going on, even Germany built a 
monument, and acknowledged. The deniers are sti
ll -- try to deny it. And we are dead an -
- in another five years, even
 the children survivors will be 
gone -- another 10 years, the 
children survivors, I™m talking, who are now 68. 
Q: What do you think will happ
en to the memory of
 the Holocaust when
 the survivors are 
gone? Wh at -- do you th ink there has been alrea
dy in -- what is the im
pact of survivor™s 
testimonies already, on the collective Holo caust memory, and what
 will happen when 
they™re gone, do you think? 

A: I had to tell you the tru -- you just go by 
proof. No rman published 
a book to Syracuse 
University. They sent him hi
s -- their catalog. On the new 
books, I think it™s new books 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
41
they published, I™m not sure, but I think by 10, half are on Holocaust, 50 years after. As a 
matter of fact, people, because they can cope 
better with this now, are really doing more. 
Shows -- now, the gathering I had, it was s
upposed to be sh -- 
played only till the 18
th
 of 
July. By popular demand they had to prolong 
it. Speeches, lectures, and specially I will 
tell you, Schindler™s List, by Sp ielberg, help ed  
a lot. Also, The Ho locaust, by what is his 
name? I forgot his name -- help
ed the awareness of people. 
Q: You mean this -- this late 70™s movies [indecipherable] on NBC. 

A: Yeah, what is his name? 
Q: I don™t re-remember who did it, but I just remember -- 
A: Wait, it™ll come to me. And Spielberg™s, he
lped a lot, too. Even
 -- even the comedy, 
which really never ta -- anybody thought that
 you can write about Ho locaust in a comedy 
form. 
Q: Life is Beautiful? 
A: Life is Beautiful, still brought the awareness.
 It™s not facts, it™s d is -- but it still -- that 
was something so cruel. His reaction with th e boy being in the camp. At least, in any 
form, they try now, and they™re
 very successful. It™s very 
accept -- very, very successful. 
Q: So you th ink those -- those popular expres
sions, or representations of the Ho locaust 
are very important? 

A: Oh, very important, because we don™t forg
et -- the world to forg
et the -- now it™s the 
second generation wh at took upon themselves
 to do it. No t exactly my  daughter, but 
many children of survivors, who continue. And 
their children, probably
. You see, with us

Jews, we never forget the goodn
ess done to us, and we never 
ga -- forget the wickedness. 
We still celebrate Purim, which is remembra
nce of Hamen, who wa
s han -- was hanged. 
We never forget the one thing physician, and 
we -- the c -- th-the crusaders. We™ll never 
forget it. Not I personally, I will not be ther
e. I™m talking about th
e future generations. 
Such  cruelty, no. You know, every Passover no
w, we say a special prayer now, included 
in ours when we recite the 
Haggadah, which is the book th
at we read on Passover about 
the camps, the concen tration camp s. We have
 services o n  our -- at home in the Yom 
Kippur. And this will go for generations.

Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview 
with Amalie Salsitz. T h is is tape number tw
o, side B. And you wanted to move -- add 
something to what we were saying. 
A: Yeah, I wanted to elaborate. Like I 
mentioned before, we Jews rememb er our 
benefactors, and rememb er our killers. Now 
we -- ma -- Norman 
was in touch with a 
Polish woman, Stashka, who was helpful. Sh e 
didn™t save him -- his life, but she was 

helpful, and in the way -- some ways, endange
red her life, because for harboring a Jew, 
or helping a Jew -- not helpin
g, but harboring a Jew, she 
could be -- have been killed 
together with the -- Norman
. And the other woman, who 
took me in, my f-father™s 
partner™s wife. I search for her, but I had 
the wrong address, I 
couldn™t find her. Till

finally, 11 years ago, a friend of Norman, a Po
le, located her. So we sent invitation -- at 
that time she was already 76 years old, and we
 invited both of them to United States as 
our guests. They were here fo
r three weeks. They 
were honored, they
 got -- we live in 
Springfield, they got, from the ci
ty hall, they got the key of th
e city. They were invited to 
-- they gave testimony, and for Yale, whitesafe
, they ga -- they were invited to ADL. 
They -- we spoke there. The Polish consulat
e was there. We have even the tapes from 
there. And naturally we took th em sightseeing,
 and they met my  daughter, and nis -- to 
old -- Mrs. Eezhaniecekov, the 
older one who helped me, said
 to me, ﬁYou stayed in my 
house three weeks, I stayed in
 you, now we even.ﬂ I said
, ﬁNo, we are not even . You 
harboring me endangered your 
life, and the life of your whole fami ly by keep ing me. I 
invite you, normal times, material
ly it didn™t matter, I have th
e facilities, and um -- I just 
hosted you as a friend, without 
any fear of repercussion. So we are not even. I still am in 
debt to you.ﬂ And th en, also a -- I would like 
to tell that after the war, when we met and 
we got married, we got married under our re
al name, but not officially. We had the 
reception, people we didn™t know
 -- the only one that we 
knew, it was my boyfriend -- 
my late boyfriend™s sist er Sasha. The rest we
 didn™t know the people, big officials, and 
big -- in our apartment. So Norman and I, we pr
omised ourselves, if 
we will live to age to 
be able to celebrate the 50
th
 anniversary, we may -- will 
make it like a wedding, and 
thank God we able to fulfill our
 dream, our wish, and four years ago, I made -- we made a 
big -- for 120 people, a reception. Like a weddin
g, except that the -- 
we didn™t exchange 
the vows, the -- and my sister came from Is
rael, Babka. My cousin, first cousin from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
44
Argentina came with her husband. My cousin
 from Toronto, Canada came. My family 
from Chicago, from Dallas. Not -- not only
 my daughter from Bost
on with the family. 
And from Washington, from all over. This mean
t so much for me. The warmth, the firs 
time. And the speeches were just beautiful. 
Again, I missed my sister. My parents I 
understood, they wouldn™t have 
lived, normally, to be able to participate in our party. But 
my  sister was only 17. She wo
uld have been 72 years old. 
Sh e probably would have been 
a grandmother. And I missed her, and her family
 that she never had. But it was a very big 
affair, and I was -- it -- and also the survivo
r™s friends, came, who ard. So at least there 
was a celebration. But like any 
other celebration -- on my daughter™s wedding, too, was a 
-- being she™s a only child, it was done in Shor
t Hills, which i-is here in New Jersey, 
exquisite place, beautiful. But wh en I walked to the 
aisle with my husband, I didn™t have 
tears from joy, only missing my  parents, who 
couldn™t be at the wedding. So, on ev ery 
happy occasion, there™s this sadness, that lo --
 that -- the loss of the dear ones. Naturally, 
also, my sister came from Israel w ith her la
te husband, but still, the other sister wasn™t -- 
the -- that she could have b
een -- at that time my parent
s could be still alive. So no 
celebration ha -- is -- it sure is supposed  to 
be a hundred  percent happy, it™s never. Also, 
because outwardly, we live a nor
mal life. I can™t complain. We
 were quite successful in 
the United States in many respects. Acknowle
dged, respected in our community, in our 
Temple. We publish a lot, we known people. Sa
y as much as we can, we quite charitable, 
we known. But during 
the night, where we cannot control our thoughts, the dreams are 
still terrible. We are still chased, are still k
illed, and we caught. A
nd this is when one 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
45
awakes the other. On e spouse -- or my  husba
nd e -- or I -- my husband. Because we 
screaming still. But I guess this will be till th
e day till we die. Peop
le thought we -- we 
thought that with time 
there wouldn™t be bleeding so much
, but it™s not true. It was with 
us. So we will ask, can we ev
er forgive, and forget. And I 
tell, I cannot forget. I don™t 
have any right to fo rgiv e, because the victims 
are not there to forgive.
 I™m still alive, but 
they are not there, so I don™t 
have the right to forgiv e. Peopl
e ask me if I™m religious, if I 
believe in God. I say, I observe, I™m not so 
religious. Iv -- but I believe in Go d. I cannot 
prove that there is not a God. In moments of 
distress, I will still turn 
to God. But I cannot 
say that I love Him. I cannot say that I hate
 Him, but I don™t love Him. I still questioning, 
where was He, that He permitted such atro
cities. If I found peace, no. I cannot. Not 
because nor -- I -- I can sed -- I can generalize,
 in United States, we didn™t get any  help 
how to cope. First we were imme
rsed in life, to establish us, 
as we are busy. So  the days 
were easier. But in -- older we get, and now 
when we -- I am retired, my husband™s semi-
retired, it™s still so fresh, and so
 painful. And we try to reas
on, doesn™t work. And also by 

association. We traveled extensively, except
 I mu st -- I shouldn™t brag, except India, and 
South Africa, we were all over the world. Wh
en I saw in schools children led by teacher, 
I didn™t see Jewish children led by teach
er. I saw that the children left to the 
Umshlaktplatz. Dr. Kolchuk™s children. Ther
e were times in the beginning, not now any 
more, when I was in a plac
e with a lot of people, es pecially when there was 
commemo ration of the Holo caust, few thousand 
people. I was always afraid to -- that 
there will be --a  bomb will be thrown in, 
or fire, because I remember some of my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
46
friend™s family were put in th
e synagogue, and let -- and burn
ed to -- the synagogue, bur -
- and burn in the synagogue. 
I was afraid of gatherings. And many times when I see -- 
when I saw a dogcatcher, I asso
ciated it with the chasings, 
and catching the Jews, hunting 
for them. I remember my neighb
or had a lot of cats, so the see -- S P S called her, told her 
to put cages. And when I saw it, I started to cr
y, I said, ﬁOpen it, I cannot see it.ﬂ Because 
when I -- me -- I -- we -- we caught. 
Till now, when I see cattle cars, picture 
[indecipherable] how my  dear one were caught 
in it.  See my  mo ther was not sent to 
concentration camp, nor my father, we didn™t
 have any in  my town, Stanislawow, when  
we were under -- because we were under th
e Russians. The German
s had excuse for the 
war that we are all Communists. And they ju
st killed us in ditches, the -- dug in the 
ghetto, on Jewish cemetery, we saw it. On
e different excuse, different, supposedly 
reason, every time. So you see, this -- you can
not erase something like this. It stays with 
you. And the same thing with
 food, when I give, till now I cannot face food, because I 
remember the times w e starved, and moi -- 
my  poor daughter said -- she was quite 
chubby one ch-child, because 
she said, ﬁYou always reminde
d me how we -- you starved, 
and the ch ildren in ghetto star
ved, and you always make me 
eat,ﬂ which is true. I cannot, 
because -- so there are many thi
ngs that shaped me, 
remained with me. Again, Imelda has 
a lot of shoes. I stuff too. Not as many as
 she has, and clothes. In case I cannot buy 
because I didn™t have, and the same with food.
 And my daughter with food also. She™ll 
buy a lot she doesn™t eat. God fo rbid th
at something should happen, her children 
shouldn™t have food. So certain
 things remained with us.

Q: Are there certain -- which are your favor
ite holiday s, and whic
h don™t you celebrate 
any more, because they have
 memories, that you can™t. 
A: I always like Passover, Easter, always. High holidays I celebrate, but it™s hard for me, 
because there™s a lot of prayer
s for dead, for killing, and ve
ry hard, but I 
do. But then 
again I recall how it was home, how I used to co
me to my mother, because we girls didn™t 
attend synagogue like it -- Christians, or an American girls go. We used to bring just 

perfume, because we used to feast -- no fast, not
 feast, not to eat, so naturally, salts, and 
[indecipherable] to revive. I -- so I rememb
er it vividly. So  it™s hard, it™s hard.  
Q: Let™s maybe talk about something that is 
more joyful for the moment, and that™s the 
family of your -- your daughter. You had diffi
culties understanding sometimes, but she -- 

she is a suc cessful professional -- 

A: Very. 
Q: -- she has three boys. 
A: Well, yes. 

Q: Talk a little bit more about [indecipherable] 
A: You see with my  daughter is only really -- 
she is not -- never was the girl who liked to  
laugh, like other, to giggle, they  happy, because of us. Only  child, with older parents than  
others. I was 34 years old, Norman 37, were 
in this time -- not now, but at that time 
particular, women had really 
children 25, 24, young mothers.
 I was older, and she was a 
good girl, she was obedient, sh
e liked to, but inside, probabl
y, she rebelled. An d because 
the only child, like she said, I smothered her 
with love. So when  she was 17, she wanted 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
48
to -- she was accepted to college, because sh
e graduated one year before, being she 
wanted to  go graduate school, and she was a 
very good student, they experiment here in 
Springfield. So I let her go, beca
use I felt she needs to get aw
ay, to be on her own. I was 
hurt when she decided to settle
 in Boston, because I™ve told
 her, ﬁYou™re our only child, I 
would like to watch you childre
n, my  grandchildren growin
g up.ﬂ I™m -- I know -- after 
all, we are not such  young parents to start o
ff, we were by 60 something. And I knew that 
it will be harder and harder. ﬁI will prefer it,
ﬂ I said, ﬁif you move closer by at least an 
hour driv e if you don™t want to
 be next to us. To be -- we 
should be able 
really, to be 
mo re with you.ﬂ Bu t she decided to go to 
Boston. I was hurt, but it was her choice. And 
really, it is the situation. 
The older son Du stin, m-m- m -- I have so many beau tiful 
memo ries about him, h-his talk and everything
, because we -- we were able still to see 
him at least once a month. And he adores Norman, because happens when  he was born, 
his father was doing internship
, so interns wo
rk ed 37 hours in the ho
spital, so he hardly 
saw. So every time it was my  husband, wh om he
 calls in Hebrew Saba. Saba, Saba all the 
time, becau se he was used. The middle one, we 
love him, but we™re not
 so close, and he™s 
not close to us. The youngest 
one, same story. What, we see them o n ce in three months, 
once in tw o months, and also it™s not that my
 daughter tells them at least once a week, 
call them. They actually call 
now mo re, once a month when we give them allowances, 
you know? But not how we feel, how we are.
 There™s not the closeness, which hurt me 
very much so. Because this is  the whole world. My daughte r was the whole world for me. 
There was --every place we went, we took her 
along. As a matter of 
fact, she liked to go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
49
so -- so much, that so
metimes when there was a wedding, and she was not invited, I make 
believe I am sick so she can
 go with my husba
nd, okay? And it™s not so because of 
distance. We are very candid to each other. Th
ere™s respect, there is kind of love. It is. 
But it™s not the warmth that I expected. 
Q: Have you ever found that ki
nd of warmth, and that kind of
 love that you really wanted 
then? 

A: Was that? 

Q: Anybody? 
A: To be honest, with
 my  friend who died . 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: This Dr. Dubin. Yes. Then I had another 
friend, also survivor, she was about six years 
older than I am, also. You see,
 when I have really friends, 
it™s not acquaintance. It™s like 
sisters even more, becau
se they went through what I we
nt through. There is so much 
understanding, openness, even
 candidly we can [indecipherable] our -- our hurts, our 
feelings, even our husband, our children,
 candid, straight. Unfo rtunately both are 
deceased, thi -- I did find it. It was such warm, beautiful relationship. 
My daughter is like 
my  husband, not demonstrative. She is hurt no
w, that her two sons are not demonstrative, 
not warm, but she is the same way, now sh
e admits. And now sh e understands, being a 
mother, how it hurt me at that time. But she™
s trying. She™s a decent human being, I™m 
proud of her. Like she didn™t want to be a 
criminal lawyer, because she cannot defend 
people who are guilty. I™m proud. You 
know, this ap -- attitude to life.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
50
Q: When you just said she doesn™t want to
 defend people who ar
e guilty, it reminded me 
of the question that I wanted to
 ask you. Did you ever testify? 
A: Oh yes, yes. 
Q: You had seen so ma ny th ings. You did. 

A: I was called in 1963 or fou
r, to come to Minsta, and tes
tify against the Gestapo. Hans 
Krieger, who was the chef of Gestapo for -- in
 my town Stanislawow, and am -- Brand, 
and then Doust. As a matter of fact, I witn
esses willful killing by 
Doust. But something 
happened to me. When I was ca
lled the first time, I went by 
myself. The second time they 
called me during the vacation, I didn™t have 
with whom to leave my daughter, I took her 
along. Then -- but each time I got notificati
on from the German consulate, they arranged 
the tickets, everything. When  there was suppear 
-- supposed to be the judgment of Doust, 
willful killing, I was surprised. I got just a ph
one call, no tickets, that I have to come to 
the tr -- to the verdict of the trial. I didn™t
 like it, because usually it was accompanied by 
the ticket. I found it fishy. I called up the Ge
rman consulate, they 
didn™t know anything 
about it. Luckily, luckily, in
 my  cen -- how you call it, 10 cents or something, that I 
checked. They didn™t 
know anything about it. Naturally
, I didn™t go. And I didn™t hear 
anything, why I didn™t come, nothing, and no ti
ckets. Luckily. Then, 
I was asked to come 
to Vienna, to testify against two brothers, 
Mauer, Willie and Hans, wh
o were really very 
cold. But one of them, the ol
der one, wenald was killing in
 ghetto aktion  action. He 
knew me because I had to work as a chamberm
aid in apartment downstairs by this Doust, 
and he saw -- know -- knew me by sight. In th is
 particular case he saved my  life. He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
51
pushed me inside, not I should be
 taken into  transport. And th en, also, I was able to save 
my father, the whole family, b
ecause I told this my father, 
later, after, they believe, 
because my father was ve
ry young looking, I saved him. So
 when I had to testify, and he 
recognized me by my eyes. 
Somehow he said, you know, 
gestap -- es -- no German, 
especially SS off -- were not supposed to 
have any -- anything to do with Jewesses. 
Luckily, majority didn™t do it, they were afraid
. But somehow he was intrigued. I told you 
I had the dark eyes, but my  eyes -- and he
 recognized me, because when there was the 
killings, when we went to the 
ghetto, they discharge all th
e chambermaids. We can work 
as slave labors, but not in their private homes
. He recognized me. So I felt, if I g o  to 
testify -- I really didn™t know what decision 
to make. If he still recognized the ey es, and 
he said, ﬁLook, here I saved this Jewess, 
and how she™s paying my  back.ﬂ I felt my  duty 
is to testify, but I couldn™t bring my self 
to do it, because I didn™t. I didn™t go. Till now 
I™m bothered, because he killed so many. Afte
r he saved me and my family, I w itnessed 
the killing of my neighbor. She was walking 
on Umshlaktplatz. Fr
om behind, she was 
walking, he shot her. Just for pleasure. It wa
s not that he was ordered, it was not that it 
was the aktion, where they used
. But I couldn™t bring myself. 
Q: So you didn™t want him to 
-- to -- to say you betrayed him,
 when he in fact saved your 
life? 

A: He would feel I betrayed him, the Jewess,
 you know how it is. If 
this would be puzzle, 
that he would blame me, I wouldn™t care. This is the point. Because in his theory, Jews 
are vermin, Jews are everything
, look. This is the reason.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
52
Q: I just want a quick follow 
up question to th e Doust thing. So  what did you expect had 
happened with this
 notification that was not accompanied by a ticket? What -- what did 
you think? 
A: There was a group of Nazis, [indecipherable
] Nazis, who tried to 
get away with -- to -- 
to do away with witn
esses to the trials. And the -- beca
use I heard later another case like 
this. But when I checked the co
nsulate, luckily, I said, ﬁYou 
invited me?ﬂ They sent me a 
letter. I said, ﬁHow comes you send me -- you di
dn™t send me the tickets?ﬂ They  checked, 
he said, ﬁWe didn™t send you a letter.ﬂ  
Q: I forgot to ask you that. I have -- act
ually just one mo re question left -- two. 
A: Good. 
Q: And one question is, how do you feel 
about the role of th
e Holocaust Museum? 
A: I think it™s very important, because our peop
le learned about it. After all, statistically 
it™s proven. So far they had 
10 and a half, by now probably 
11 millions people wi -- very 
small percentage Jews, the rest are non-Je
ws. And Jew -- non-Jews, from the bible belt, 
from the west, that they never heard it, and 
never would know about the Holo caust. It™s 
doing what it™s supposed to do. I don™t know, 
like inclusion of other killings, but they™re 
not genocide, it™s a big difference. This is a 
holocaust. It™s terrible 
if you kill one person, 
but still you cannot compare it w h en you try 
to erase the whole -- whole people, whole 
race. So I don™t like it. But being -- I have to 
accept it. It™s better so mething than nothing. 
It™s undergro und, so if the government gave the 
-- so this is -- thank God we have also the 
Yad Vash em. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
53
Q: And I also wanted  to ask you if you think 
back -- I mean 50 years, and 55 years are a 
long time, but if you th ink back
 for just a minute, talk to me
 about one or two events in 
this country that were really important to you. 
A: In United States? 

Q: That made -- in the United St
ates, that made an impression. 
A: Oh, now, wait a mo ment, important, impr
essions big difference. Important was the 
birth of my daughter, see? 
Q: Yeah, alri -- alright. Let me re -- no, 
you™re right, let me rephrase this then. An 
important cultural or political event, or a m
ovement, the Civil Rights Movement. Did that 
touch you in any way? I don™t want to
 lead you now, I just want to -- 
A: Now, wait a moment, important ag
ain was when I became a citizen. 
Q: There you go, that™s one. 

A: Important, my  daughter™s wedding. Those ar
e close to me. Civil Rights,  yes, I felt 
they should have. I didn™t like the discrimina
tion, and I™m glad the situation is improving. 
Unfo rtunately they have their Farrakons, and 
if they could do, it™s not the majority, but 
you have -- but first there was not the majority
 in Germany either with Hitler. This how it 
starts. If th ey have the free -- 
if they would have the upper 
hand, I™m afraid, too. But I 
still think I was happy. I wouldn™t march for 
them. But I was happy that the situation is 
improving. I didn™t like what I heard, what 
the Americans had done to Indians, either. I 
am -- I am for equal rights, I 
am for freedom, and for respect 
to everybody. And it™s very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054
  
 
 
 
54
important to teach everyone to respect, and 
to accept, because if we would teach, and 
succeed, we won™t have a holocaust. 
Q: I want to ask you that last question on 
another tape because we are nearing the end, 
but maybe just a brief one. You have lived 
under Ru ssian occupatio
n. Ho w did you feel 
about the -- in the early
 50™s when the -- the fear and 
the hatred really, of Communism 
was very great in this country? Did you have 
a di -- slightly different opinion, or did you 
approve of what -- 

A: Yes, there should have been fear, because th
at™s what I witness --
 I lived. It was a big 
prison. Imagine, they have their classificati
on. Everyone™s supposed to be equal. No. So  
you had to be a daughter of a -- a streetcl
eaner, to be -- become something, and God 
forbid if you are middle class again, the doo
r was closed. As a matter -- I had very bad 

experience, if not of my lat -- late sister 
Celia, who was so  be
autiful, we would have 
been sent to Siberia. We got paragraph 11
. They were supposed 
to take away our a-
apartment. I wanted to study, and I wanted 
to become a docto r, they didn™t expe -- accept 
me. So they only accepted me 
as a teacher because they were
 short on teachers. But when 
they found out my  background
, even from this they expe
lled me, u n less I pay tuition, 
which was more then if my 
 father made in two months
. So where™s the equality. Race 
too. Unless -- when you a Jew, you were a Je
w. It was written in the kemkart yevari. So 
not that we had the door open fo
r us. Actually, in my part, the Ukrainian got all the rights, 
he became the big one. The Pole
 was the second. It -- again 
on the third place was Ivray, 
the Jew. And the fear. I -- they blackmailed, 
for example, us students. They had special

department political spedsjust. And they called 
us in, especially the one like middle class, 
that unless you denounce your
 friend, unless you find so
mething, they make you a 
informer, blackmailer, and they  blackmail you. 
I was afraid to speak. On ly home, to 
parents. And the fear that they 
will ship us to Siberia. Then 
I thought it™s very bad, but lo 
behold, I didn™t know what 
is awaiting me when Hitle
r came, when the Germans 
occupied. So  at least this one, they let you liv
e. But here, our lives was in danger. So I 
understood, they wanted to enslave people, 
robots. And also, there was the machinery, 
the one who was a [indeciphera
ble] Stalin, who lived likekings, and the people still 
didn™t have enough food. 
They™re barely to live on. 
Q: It™s a good place to stop. This is the end of
 tape two, side B, interview with  Amalie 
Salsitz. 

A: You want some more?

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: -- view with Amalie Salsitz, 
this is tape number three, si
de A. My question, my  next 
question is what do you thin
k -- you may have said it, but
 maybe you can elaborate one 
more time on it, what do you think are the le
ssons? Do you think th ere are lessons that 
can be draw n from the Holocaust, and has the wo rld learned from them? 
A: Yes, there are lessons that can be draw n from the Holocaust. What
 intolerance can do, 
what hatred can do, how destructive it is. But,
 if the world learned so mething, I™m sorry 
to tell you not. Otherw ise, we 
wouldn™t have Rwanda, we wo
uldn™t have Cambodia, and 
we wouldn™t have other mass 
killings that I don™t know ho
w to stop because there™s so 
many now o-occur in this worl
d. So there™s still deep hatred, still, and I don™t know -- 
trying -- we try, but the difference is, when 
the Armenians were kille
d by the Turks, the 
world stood by quietly, and it was not later -- 
there were not -- no -- no trials, and not too 
much really, in the press.
 With the Holocaust -- 
Q: You mean the Kurds by the Turks? 
A: No, no, no, Armenians. 
Q: The Armen -- Armenians. 
A: Armenians. This is why Hitler felt that 
he can do it, because what™s to the byhear, 
when there was killing of people, and -- and 
here there were Christians ki -- Moslems 
killing Christians. The church st
ood by, and everything. So he
 thought he will have a free 
hand -- and he was right -- to do with the 
Jews. But now with th
e Holocaust, because 
there was a trial. It™s so mu
ch written and done about it to 
educate the people, I do hope --

I do hope that it will not occur. At least our 
President Clinton cited as a reason to bomb, 
and to en ter f-f-f -- for [indecipherable] country , because that the world stood by during 
the Holocaust. I don™t accept it, but still this 
was an excuse. So let™s hope. And the trials 
that they have now in Geneva, and ha
 -- Hague. Maybe this will prevent. 
Q: But you don™t accep
t the argument, no? 
A: No. 

Q: Why not? 

A: The argument that -- 
Q: From Clinton, that Clinton ma
de. You said, ﬁI don™t accept it.ﬂ 
A: From -- because the truth is where was he
 in Rwanda, other countries? And where is 
he with the Kurds in Tu
rkey? In s -- in Iraq, in Syria? If 
so -- so why he had to step in? 
This why I don™t accept it. And also, the tr
uth is, when one state broke away from 
Yugoslavia, one after another, why didn™t he 
do when  the Croatians expelled the Serbs, 
and the killings? Why he permitte
d this? If so, I will take him seriously. Had he acted the 
same way with the others.  
Q: Is there anything that you would like to 
say befo re we conclude this interview? 
A: It™s very important, really, to keep it up in
 schools, and to teach and educate, because 
the children are the future of a nation. And 
if you teach them, hopefully something will 
sink in that never again such
 cruelty will be perpetuated among another human being.  
Q: Thank you very much for 
the conversation with
 the interview. This concludes the 
United States Holocaust Memorial interview w
ith Amalie Salsitz. Y eah, that™s the end.
