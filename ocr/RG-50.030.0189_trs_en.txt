GERHART RIEGNER 
April 28, 1992 
 
 
Q. Dr. Riegner, would you tell us your 
full name , and where and when you were born? 
 

A.  My na me is Gerhart Riegner.  Second name  is
 Moritz.  I was name d after my grandfather.  I 
am born in Berlin.  I am a real Berliner, as Ke
nnedy would have said.  And I am bor n on the 12th 
of Septembe r, 1911.  

 

Q.   And could you tell us a little bit about wh
at your life was like when you were growing up in 

Berlin with your fa mily, frie
nds, the climate, so forth?\ 
 

A.   We ll, I come  from a  typical German Jewi
sh fa mily.  And I would say that we belonged 
already -- as Kurt Blume nfeld would 
have said -- to the post-assimilatio
ni st  era.  It is typical that 
I am born in Berlin and that my two parents were
 also already born in Berlin.  My grandparents 
came from very typi cal German mi ddle-sized ci
ties.  One grandfather was born in Magdeburg.  

The other -- my grandmother was born in Ha
lle.  The second grandmother was born in 
Neubrandenburg.  And the other grandfather -- he
re we come  already to the frontier towards 
Poland -- in Niederschl esien, which is Silesi a, the 
more German part of it.  So I am comi ng from 
a long stock German fa mily.  We  had in the fa
mily two traditions.  On the one hand, a very 
Jewish tradition.  My grandmother, my mother
's  side, was a Lewandovsky.  She was a niece of 
Louis Lewandovsky, who was the creator of the mode
rn synagogue music, and some  of the most 
beautiful modern melodies originate from hi m.
  His son-in-law was the famous philosopher, 
Hermann Cohen, the founder of the 
Marburgerschule of the school 
of Neo-Kantianism.  He was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
2 
 
one of the few full professors under the Kaiserreich 
in the old style.  He came  from ve ry Jewish 
origins.  He studied the Talmud.  
He  went to the Jewish theologi
cal semi nary in Breslau before 
he became a philosopher.  And he is the author 
not only of great works and the reinterpretation 
of Kant, but also of religious philosophy, of 
work in religious philosophy, based on the sources 
of Judaism, "die Religion der Vernunft."  This 
is a great man in my fa
mily, whom I knew as a 
child. And where -- every Sunday we went for lunch 
to my grandparents' andfor coffe e or tea to 
Cohen's.  And in Cohen's house, which was very
 near that of my gr
andparents', every Sunday 
there was a great party, si
xty, fifty, sixty persons.  And the old 
ma n was nearly blind, was in the  
rocking chair, like Kennedy, with white, wonderful wh
ite hair, and the blue dark glasses, was  
presiding over -- what should I ca
ll it?   Holding court, 
if you want.  He was really nice to us 
children.  He played with us, and -- but before 
all, I knew that he was an important ma n.   
I see him still in the synagogue on -- Simc has 
Torah. 01:10  In 1917, I was six years old, when 
he walked directly behind the ra
bbi with the little Torah, very li
ght because he was not so very 
strong any more.  And he looked like an old Jewi
sh prophet, with his fantastic great face, his 
white locks, and he gave the impression of 
a real leader of a religious movement.   
 
Q.   But you knew he was also an important  ma n in the country in terms of his academi c  

standing? 

 

A.   He was fighting anti-Semitism.  And he 
spoke out from 1879, when the fa mous attacks by 
Treitschke, the historian, and Stoecke, the priest
 and the official Dompr
aediger of the empire, 
attacked the Jews.  And he was hims elf, by the 
way, the victim of many anti-Semitic attacks, and 
was -- had never a call from another 
university -- this is also very
 interesting -- and wa s fighting 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189

for his pupils to get appointed as professors, and 
had one defeat after the other in this respect.  
Even a ma n like Ernst Ge rschieler, as great as 
his name  was in this country -- was his most 
important pupil probably -- couldn't get in Marbur
g, the Privatdozenten, and so on.  Now, this is 
the one -- and here, the one source of my Je
wish background which was perhaps in myself 
stronger than in the family itself.  And this was 
due to the general climate in Germany.  My first 
anti-Semitic experience was on the second day of sc
hool, when I went to school in 1917,    and 
some body c a lled me  "ein dreckiger Judenluemme
l," dirty Jew boy -- some thing. And I -- this 
was my fi rst anti-Semitic experi ence.  And I r
eacted immediately, not very intelligently.  But I 
couldn't not react.  And I replied 
"dreckiger Christenbengel," which 
wasn't very intelligent.  But I 
did not accept the attack.  My second experience
 was an experience of social anti-Semitism, in 
school, when a good friend of mi ne, who was also a 
son of a lawyer, never succeeded in inviting 
me to his home. 
 
Q.   You me an he tried, but his parents wouldn't allow it? 
 

A.   Yes.  It was a tragedy with which I fought
 three years, each time finding another excuse why 
they didn't invite me , until I finally understood why.  Now, all this ha ppene d in a Germany in 

which there was a strong anti-Semitic move me nt .  
I come to it in a mo me nt when I speak about 
the political background. 

 

Q.   All right.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189

A.   But I reme mber, for instance, the day on wh
ich Rathenau was assassinated, in 1922.  I was 
not yet eleven years old.  And I reme mber the da
y my mother was in the clinic and we visited 
her.  She had some  oper a tion -- I don't re me
mbe r  what it was -- and it shook us to the 
foundations.  This was the great German Jewish pa
triot, who, in 1918, at the end of the war, was 

the only one to suggest that the war was lo
st "Levee en ma sse" Œ the popular resistance 
move me nt -- a Jew who had the courage to do th
is -- was the organizer 
of the whole economi c 
admi nistration of raw materials during the four 
years of the first World War, for Ge rmany.  A 
really great German patriot, no doubt about it, 
who had imme nse merit, from the German point 
of view Œ  

 

Q.   He was a very able ma n. 

 

A.   -- to have organized it.  And he was, as a 
mi nister of foreign affair
s, killed by "voelkische," 
racist  people.  I will never forget this.  This -- and in this whole -- this whol e movement, ther e 

were at least three, four, five ot
hers -- I am not speaking even of
 Hitler -- the first revolt in 1924.  
But in every election we had it, and you felt it, 
and you saw it, and we were very noisy.  Now I 
come  to the other side.  My fa mily was very inte
rested in politics.  My father was associated 
since 1910 with a me mber -- the socialist me mber
, a prominent socialist who became a me mber 
of the Reichstag, who was during 
the revolution in 1918 a member 
of the  provisional Prussian 
governme nt, mi nister of justice, and who became  
one of the great fighters against the death 
penalty in Germany.  

 

Q.   Kurt Rosenfeld?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189

A.   Kurt Rosenfeld, yes.  My father was not a 
socialist.  My fa ther wa
s a very socially mi nded 
democrat.  Perhaps more social than the Socialis
t Party, deeply -- but didn't  believe in Marxism, 
and so on, but he had a very great social consci
enceness.  He was a typical product of his time, 
where the idea of "allgemeine B
ildung," universal knowledge, unive
rsal education, was the great 
idea towards which a great part of German Jewr
y attended.  He was very close to Cohen, who 
considered him as his preferred nephew, w
ho had no children, and, therefore, the close 
relationship.  He was in reality very knowledgeable
 in German literature.  When he died, I heard 
him -- and the last time I saw him a nd -- lying on
 his bed -- declaimi ng for hours verses from 

Goethe's Faust, from Heine's "Lieder," and so on.
  You know, this is huma n.  At the end of the 
life, the souvenirs of the young years come  out ve
ry, very strongly -- that rema in, years full of 
German "Bildung."  He was a grea
t connoisseur of art.  In his 
old years he even wrote books on 
art and articles. Where he didn't succeed to write 
about European art -- to publish it in America, I 
gave him the idea to write for a -- European publi
cations about American art, and he published a 
series of mo dern American art.  It was very 
appreciated.  He was at home  in ma ny wa ys in ma ny 
fields of human knowledge and endeavors.  As I 
said, he was a lawyer.  And he was even very 
esteemed amongst his colleagues.  He was what is 
called a me mber -- elected as a me mber of the 
"Vorstand de r Anwaltska mmer," which is the chamber of lawyers, where all the lawyers elect 

their own disciplinary courts and instances.  An
d he got in Berlin the largest number of votes 
amongst the lawyers, which -- for a ma n who was very modest -- and so this was quite 

rema rkable.  My mother was also active in pol
itics.  She became  active in education of wome n 
and informa tion of women as citizens of the count
ry.  She gave lectures and courses to -- in 
women's schools about the responsibility, civil 
responsibility of wome n.  She became a very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
6 
 
active me mber of the Democratic Party and belonge
d to the enlarged Bureau of the party, went 
out taking -- ma king speeches at 
all elections, and so on.  So you 
see here, there was a political 
atmosphere, both from my parents and from associat
es of my father.  This
 was the other part.  I 
was deeply interest ed in politics all my life.  
And I saw the disappearance, slow disappearance of 
the democratic republic.  I had mentioned today 
when Rathenau was assassinated.  I reme mber 
the day when the first president 
of the republic died.  I took part
 in the 1925 -- I 
think, in the 
funeral in the Lustgart en with 
the hundreds of thousands of people.  And I felt already then 
some how instinctive whether we hadn't  already buri
ed the republic there. 
 And all the more when 
Hindenburg, to our great disappoint
ment, was elected president.  And -- which was, of course, a 
terrible regressive step from the point of view 
of democracy.  This all I lived very intensely and 
followed very intensely.  And I saw with growi
ng fear what was happening, and the great uccess 
of the racist and Nazi mo veme nts.  I finished 
my school in 1929 with a very good examination.  I 
went my fi rst term -- I followed in the University
 in Freiburg im Breisgau -- was my fi rst being 
outside the house and on my own. 
 I continued in Berlin.  I we
nt again the next summe r  to 
Heidelberg, which was perhaps the gr eatest expe
ri ence in my university life.  This was the 
Heidelberg of -- where people teaching, like Jasp
ers and Anschutz and Ra
tbur and Gundolf, and 
-- you name  it, Tibelius. This was really the summ
it of Ger man intellectua
l life, and it ma rked 
me  very mu ch.  Even if I have been forced to 
separate slowly fr om the identification with the 
German people -- and you were, by the reject
ion which you felt -- always more separating 
yourselves from this milieu, from this concept of 
belonging to the German people.  This was, in 
any case, one of the great culmin
ating points of my life, which I will never forget.  And I owe 
very much to this cultural activity, to this expr ession of German culture, especially in 
Heidelberg.  I am not speaking of 
the other place, of course.  Berlin
 at that time, of the We i mar

Republic, wa s an enormously cultivated life, theate
r, opera -- I took part 
in all this fully, and I 
belonged to the Volksbuehne subscribers.  I saw 
the most mo dern theater, plays, and so on, and 
so on.  But I was very conscious about -- as I sa
id, about the going-down of the republic.  When I 
was a student , I joined the Association of the Republican St udents.  And this was not an accident .  
In Baden, where both the University
 in Freiburg and in Heidelberg  were located, there were still 
student elections.  In Prussia, 
these elections for the student  re
presentation at universities had 
already been suppressed because the Nazis had gain
ed large ma jorities all over.  But in Baden it 
was still allowed.  And I took part
 in the student elections in my
 first term, in my third term, 
ma de speeches, organized, cooperated at that time 
with people -- ve ry interesting pe ople.  Our 
patron was an old Germa n professor, von Schuelze-Gevanitz. His son was later a consul in 

Zurich -- very important consul, by the way.  Sc
huelze-Gevenitz was an economist, a sociologist, 
a very wonderful human being.  And one of the 
students with whom I cooperated then was a ma n 
who became very famous, had a very sad life, 
was Schulze Ba eusen.  He had just joined the 
democratic move me nt, comi ng from the Jungdeut
sche Orden.  He ended as a Communist, was 
one of the founders of the Rote 
Kapelle -- the Red Chapel, which he
 organized from the mi nister 
of defense residence.  A fantastic fellow, I must
 say.  We worked togeth
er in the elections in 
1929.  I would never have expected that he would go 
so far to the right and to be so true to his 
ideals.  Anyhow, you see that I was involved in th
is.  I was also involved in Heidelberg.  But 
there -- this was 1930.  There I already separate
d some how and visited 
regularly the Zionist 
groups.  I never joined the Zionist student groups, 
but I had ma ny friends there, and even raveled 
on some  of their excursions, wint
er excursions in the mountains.  I joined them, was skiing with 
them together.  And I was very much attracted by the Zionist Œ

Q.   Let me  i nterrupt for a sec
ond.  Would it be fair to say that 
as of roughly this time, near 1930, 
you are still balancing in your mind the dual loyalty of being Germ
an and Jewish and trying to 
figure out for yourself what are the problem
s and where does one have to come  down? 
 
 A.   Well, I came certainly -- I star ted certainly
 as a conscious German, but deeply offended as a 
Jew by what happened to the Jews.  And was strugg
ling first to defend it from inside, and then I 
saw more and more that this didn't work.  And so
 my way of retreating fr om identification with 
the German nation became  more and 
more clear.  I think this is as far as I can get it, but I think 
this is the right description.  And when I finish
ed my studies -- by the way, I would say that here, 
also, I am far from being only a jurist, only legac
y.  I was deeply involved in all kinds of other 
things.  I followed especially the historians, Ongden, for instance, in Berlin.  I followe d 

philosophers, Jaspers, Spengler, was 
deeply involved in all kinds of 
other art, history, and so on.   
The ideal of universal Bildung, whic
h I learned, so to speak, with th
e milk of my mo
ther -- in the 
fa mily, it was deeply working on me .  And I took it
 over from my father, from my parents.  And 
I was never one-sided.  Even in my whole Jewish
 career, you will fi nd in my library sections on 
philosophy and history and on economy
 and you name  it.  And I used my university years to the 
full to get involved and educated 
in ma ny other fields.   Now, I finished my studies with the 
so-called "Referendar" Exam.  This is the first 
great examination after th
ree, three and a half 
years of study.  And I got a very good result, a
nd was then name d in the first days of 1933 as 
"Referendar," which is a kind of assistant to a judge, if you want.  
It's  really the practical years, 
where you use what you have learned in a practical 
way.  You spend time at different tribunals at 
various degrees in the admi nistration, and as a la
wyer, and so on.  And I was in the first stage of 
this.  I was at the Amtsgericht Weding.  It's the 
largest tribunal of
 the first instance in Berlin.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
9 
 
And I wrote the judgments for the judge, which 
he signed.  And active in
 all kinds of legal 
assist ance, and so on, wrote what was asked for in
 this position.  Then ca
me Hitler to power the 
30th of January, 1933.  And this, of course, gave
 us a terrible shoc
k.  All the more -- 
 
 Q.   You did not expect it? 

 

 A.   Yeah.  But here I would say, in the Nove
mb er elections, '32, you know,
 during that year, we 
had -- I don't know -- three, four el
ections.  In the Nove mber electi
ons the Nazi party for the first 
time had lost more than a million of votes.  A nd it looked at that mo ment that it was not 

absolutely necessary.  And the whole thing that
 he got into the place as chancellor wa s an 
intrigue started by the people ar
ound the president, Hindenburg, because
 of some of the scandals 
in the eastern Prussia. And then Papen and the ot
her reactionary politicians 
combined in order, in 
a great mi scalculation, to bring 
about the coalition be
tween the Deutsch Nationale Volkspartei 
and the Nazi parties, believing that  they would 
dominate Hitler, which was, of course, ri diculous 

from the point of view of political judgment. 
 When Hitler came  to power, I was very soon 
convinced that this was a decisive point in
 the history of Germany, and I was very soon 
convinced that they would not give
 up power, and that this would l
ead to terrible persecutions for 
the Jews.  I was a little --  we come back to this
 -- a number of these Nazi ma nifestations, and so 
on, on the 30th of January, when he took power, and th
e 1st of April, and the Boycott, and so on.   

And I decided to leave Germany.  We were under 
an illusion.  We  didn't know the world outside.  
We didn't realize how deeply th
e economi c crisis had worked.  
We  thought that first the younger 
generation should get out and thenthe older should follow.  But 
the chance to build up a new 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
10 
 
existence for the younger generation was practically
 nil.  I would have liked to go then to 
Palestine.  The Zionist ideal, as I alre
ady said, worked very strongly on me .  
 
Q.   Excuse me  a second.  We re there any specific
 events that precipitate
d your decision to leave, 
or was this just your general impre
ssion after Hitler had taken power Œ 
 

A.   We ll, I think it was the general understand
ing of what was happening.  Practically -- I will 
just give you an example.  On the 1st of Apr
il, when I was suspended as "Referendar," as the 
functionary of the tribunal, the 
same  day my father was suspende
d as a lawyer, the same  day my 
older si ster, who was a teacher at the Lycee in Fr
ankfurt am Main, was suspended as a teacher, 
my youngest sister, who was still in
 school, was thrown out from school.  So out of a family of 
five -- my mother didn't exercise any professi
on as she was a good housewife at the time.  She 
was a teacher by profession, and she took on again after my father di dn't earn any money any 
more.  She became again a teacher in the Jewish
 schools and was teaching then.  The existence 
of four of fi ve of our family was completely 
put upside down.  This was -- but this accompanied 
my reason.  Of course, if I wouldn't have been th
rown out the 1st of Apr
il, ma ybe I would have 
taken longer to decide.  Although I was only su
spended, and I could have waited.  But I knew 
this was a definite throwing-out.  So I didn't wait.
   I waited a little bit,
 because on the same 1st 
of April, in the evening, there was a -- we had re
nted a little house outside of Berlin because my 
father was not in good health at the time  and the 
doctors had prescribed him he should be more -- 

in the fresh air and not running t
oo much from one tribunal to the 
other.  We  had rented a house 
in the neighborhood of Berlin.     And the eveni
ng -- and we were the only Jews there, no other 
Jewish family at all.  And at ten o'clock in 
the evening that day, there was what they called 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
11 
 
"Sprechchor," "Juda Verr ecke, Juda  Verrecke, Ju
den 'r aus."   This was an anti-Semitic local 
group of the Nazi party which ma de itself felt for 
twenty mi nutes or so.  My parents were in 
town, visited some  friends.  And I was alone inthat house with my younger 
sister.  I was in the 
bath.  I fe lt like Mara t.  What will ha ppen now
?  But I didn't make any movements, kept quiet , 
and after twenty mi nutes they disappeared.  But 
it incited me  not to leave imme diately, to wait 
whether there would be other such demonstrations. 
 It didn't happen.  And I left in the mi ddle of 
May.   I said I wanted to go -- w
ould have liked to go to Palestine.
  I was very much attracted by 
it, but I knew you had to go to a kibbutz.  A
nd -- which was very beautiful, but not for 
everybody.  And knowing that I was very individua
listic, I knew th
at this wouldn't work with 
me .  Two of my best friends decided it, and it didn
't  work.  They went, and they left afterwards, 
and finally ended in America.  And my judgme nt
 was right.  And as I was a quite good lawyer 
and very interested in, especia
lly the philosophical side of la
w, what's ca lled jurisprudence, 
theory of law and state --  this come s and joins with
 my political interests, of course.  I decided to 
continue my law studies.   I went to Pa ris, a
nd made my legal examinations again in Paris, 
Licenscie en Droit -- of the Sorbonne.  And 
but here, some thing which happened -- which I 
should perhaps say.  A few days before I left, I got a me ssage from one of the most fa mous 
professors of jurisprudence, of public law in the 
University of Berlin, Rudolf Schwent [ph].  It so 
happened that in my second term he admitted me  into his seminar.  Why he did this, I -- to this 

day I don't know, because ninety pe rcent of the 
pe ople who were there were postgraduate.  
Maybe he wanted a few youngsters who could ma
ke work and -- which he couldn't do.  I don't 
know.  In any case, I ma de a communication, an
d -- it was very interesting -- on "Die Wa ndlung 
des Rechtsstatsbegriffs".  It's not an accident
, by the way. "The changes 
in the concept of the 
state based on law."  And this communication wa
s an expose, as very we
ll received.  You know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
12 
 
it wasn't  very original.  When you are in this yo
ung stage of life, you have two choices:  Either 
you get a very bright idea, or you use your work
ing capacities and work very hard.  And as I 
didn't have especially a bright idea, I worked
 very hard, and I found 
out where the notion of 
"Rechtsst at" appears the first time  in the 18th Cent ur
y literature -- not in Ka
nt.  I forgot even the 
name.  I have it somewhere.  And this made a great impression on Schmendt because this wasn't  
known.  It's, by the way, not known because it's never  published.  And he some how l earned 

through a cousin of mi ne -- my na me  is not so fr
equent -- asked what I be -- what I become , and 
so on.  And when he heard I am leaving for France,
 he asked me to come and see him.  And for 
three hours, two and a half hours, he
 tried to persuade me  not to 
leave.  "Das kann doch nicht so 
bleiben."  "This cannot rema in like this."   "You 
know that I am a Germa n 
nationalist.  But with 
these people this cannot last.  Th
is is an episode.  In six months
 --"   We ll, the young student -- or 
whatever you call hi m -- was more intelligent in this
 respect than the professor.  I told him that I 
was convinced that this was the end, and  I had 
to build up a   new life and had to leave. It's  
interesting.  This, by the way, I -- although we were
 politically and even philosophically really 
on the extreme different positions, I am a great adhe
rer of -- that the theory of Hans Genz -- I 
will come to it in a mo ment -- who was just at
 the opposite end of theologic -- theopolitical 

concept.   I nevertheless got a 
very warm me mo ry of him.  He
 is the only German who ever 
cared for me  after I left.  This is one of 
the things which nobody will ever tell you.  I wa s 
twenty-one years when I left.  I had fr iends, 
I had comr ades in school, I had ma tes in the 

University, I have studied in three universities, 
I knew hundreds of people.  I was active in everal 

university student groups, and so on.   Not one 
German ever wrote me  a postcard after I left 
Germany.  Not one German ever asked what I had b
ecome .  With the exception of this professor.  
The lack of courage of the German intelligentsia was unbelievable.  They didn't want to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189

involved.  A Jew is outside -- was already some thi
ng like treason, and an act
 of revolt against the 
system.  So they didn't want to have anything to do with them.   But what huma nly this means -- 
that nobody ever asked for you, nobody ever sent 
you a postcard, nobody ever gave you a sign of 
life -- is something which I will never forget.   A
nd Schwendt wrote to me because he wanted to 
publish this communication I had ma de in a semi nar.
  He thought it was deserving of publishing.  
And as it was not possible -- this is
 also important to know -- to publish -- as a Jew to publish in 
Germany, you couldn't publish any more.  He trie
d, but it was impossible, to publish it in 
Austria.  This was before the Anschluss.  He didn't succeed.  But he tried at least.  And I will 

never forget this.  It's  an interesting part of my 
story, but it is also a very
 sad part of my  story.  
Now, I did go to Paris -- and we were allowed in Paris -- you hadn't to go to the lectures in the 

universities.  We  could pres
ent ourselves to the examina
tions.  And I passed the three 
examinations as soon as I could.  And when I pa
ssed the second examina
tion in the beginning of 
'34, probably spring, March probably, the French 
Barreau, the lawyers in 
Paris, got terribly 
scared of the -- I don't know -- forty, ma ybe fi
fty, young Jewish refugees who took up the law in 
France.  They were so scared -- but to a cer
tain degree they were ri
ght.  We were very good 
lawyers.  We were a very good group.  And only 
people who really meant and were involved and 
deeply involved in the profession went on with 
this.  But after all -- thousands of lawyers in 
France.  Forty or fifty Jewish lawyers would 
have disturbed their career?   And they pushed 

through a law in the French Parliament which barre
d any foreigner from the exercise of the legal 
profession until ten years after natu
ralization.  Now, as it took five
 years to get naturalized as a 
mi ni mu m, fi fteen years meant you are out.  And this
 was in the summer of
 '34 I was faced with 
what to do.  And I decided -- I wasn
't  really -- very uncle
ar there.  In the summer there was -- at 
the Sorbonne -- one of them who wa s the most em
inent legal philosophers of our time gave three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
14 
 
lectures in Paris at the Sorbonne. 
 After the second lecture, I took my courage into my hands and 
went up to him and asked him for advice.  I ha
d corresponded with him 
as a chutzpadik young  
student twice.  And he immedi
ately reme mbered this, which I was very surprised.  He was -- 
every great ma n wants to have pupils, you know, 
and is, of course, flattered.  And said 
immediately, "Come to Geneva." So I said, "W
ell, it's not so easy, you know."  I depended 
practically on the -- what an uncle of mi ne 
who was living in Holland gave me  as a kind of 
contribution monthly toma ke my 
living.  I was really proud that after a few months in Paris I got 
the first Bourse fellowship from the Alterad [ph]
 Universitaire Internationa le.  As a matter of 
fact, the only case where a ma n who had got a 
fellowship fr om the Alterad Universitaire 
Internationale, became later a pr esident of the 
Alterad Universitaire In
ternationale. Anyhow, I 
told him, "It's not so easy."   He said, "You can la
st four or five months? "
  I said, "Yes, I can."  
He said, "Come.  And aft e r four mont hs, you 
had got -- four, five months, a good lawyer, know 
you, he get you a fellowship, and after a year, you re
new the fellowship for the next two years.  
Nothing will happen to you."  And this is 
more or less how it happened.  I finished my  
examination.  I went to Geneva.  I got after four
 or five mont hs a fellowship.  And -- which was 
renewed and I had still -- I think thirteen months
 of fellowship, which, as a refugee, is an ideal 

thing.  This is unheard of.  You don't know -- th
at you don't have to be preoccupied with your 
future. So I was in Geneva, and here starts 
now the beginning of my 
career.  I was not looking 
for any job.  But while I was studying and doing 
postgraduate work, really, what it was, in 
Geneva -- Stephen Wi se and Nahum 
Goldma n decided to create in 
the autumn of or the summer 
1936 the World Jewish Congress.  And they turned
 to three professors, 
whether they couldn't 
recommend to them a young international lawyer. 
 Because the program of the World Jewish 
Congress at that time wa s two-fold: on the one ha
nd, to fight against Hitler; on the other hand, to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
15 
 
support and defend the interests of the large Jewi sh
 communities of Eastern Europe.  Practically 
all di sappeared today -- in Poland, in Roma nia -- 
three and a ha lf million in Poland, there were a 
million in Romania.   And all these eastern Europ
ean countries after the Tr
eaty of Versailles had 
to accept the mi nority treaties and the protection 
of mi norities under the guarantee of the League 
of Nations.  There was a whole procedure for 
these things, and the Congress needed some body 
who could write the briefs, and so on, and know th
e procedures.  And thos
e three professors to 
whom they turned, they all recomme nded me. 
 I don't know why.  Esp
ecially William Rappard 
(ph), who was the director of the institute, me
mb er of the Mandates Commission, old friend of 
Weizma nn, of Goldma n, and so on, and with whom 
I had never discussed Jewish affairs, but he 
knew apparently that I wa s Jewishly interested.  
 

Q.   I am goi ng to ask you more about the three pr
ofessors, because they b
ecome later -- at least a 
couple of them -- become important later, but they
'r e about to run out of tape, so let's take a 
quick break right here.  

 

A.   But it's all right?  

 

Q.   Yeah.  I think we'r e -- 

 

A.   I said too long. 

 

Q.   It will take them a minute 
or  two to put the second tape on. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
16 
 
A.   Or is it too long, too detailed?    
 

TAPE #2 

 

Q.   Dr. Riegner, you were telling us about 
the events that led to
 your being hired as a 
representative of the World Je
wish Congress in Switzerland.  
 

A.   Yeah.  This is even -- too much said.  
I was asked to become  the ma n who deals with the 
international legal problems under the system of th
e mi nority treaties at th
e League of Nations.  
Now, as I told you, the three professors who we
re approached all reco
mmended me  -- without 
telling me , by the way.  And then Goldma n appro
ached me.  He was at the time a representative 
of the Jewish Agency at the League of Nati
ons.  And there was a ma ndate system, as you know, 
but Palestine was one of the ma ndates.  And 
there was a permanent Mandate Commission which 
supervised the application of the ma ndate 
provisions by the ma ndatory powers, and he 
represented the Jewish agency vis-à-vis this or
gan in Geneva.   And he knew as such Rappard, 

who was one of the professors.  Rappard was a ve ry
 fine, liberal personalit
y.  He was teaching in 
Harvard in -- I think in 1911, a Swiss professo
r, who became  a friend of Wilson.  And it was due 
to his relations with Wilson that
 the League of Nations came to Geneva in 1919.  He was a very 
important personality in Swiss po
litics, became later a Memb er of Parliame nt.  But he was very 
respected as an international fi
gure, one of the great internatio
nal figures the Swiss had at the 
time, was presiding at the International Labor Co
nference, was one of the 
representatives at the 
League of Nations, and so on.  And he was the fi
rst director of the Mandates Commission, of the 

ma ndates section in the League of Nations s
ecretariat, and became la
ter a me mber of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
17 
 
ma ndates Commission, when he gave up this job 
and was a very great friend of the Jews and 
supported us against the White Paper of Britain 
in 1939, was a friend of great admi ration of Dr. 
Weizma nn.   He represented the Geneva Univers
ity at the laying of the founding stone of the 
Jerusalem University in 1925.  He 
was there when Weizmann gave 
Balfour the great play on this 
occasion, and told us about it a number of times.  
Anyhow, he was a -- really
 a gr eat liberal and a 
great fri end of ours, and he -- in hi s institute
, International -- the Graduate Institute of 
International Relations  was one of the places wh
ich received refugees from Italy against the 
Mussolini Fa scist state and supporte
d them and allowed them to study there.  And he did the 
same  when t he Nazis came  to power .  And we were in Geneva a large group of very gifted 

Jewish refugees and Italian refugees.  And als
o, we had wonderful profe
ssors there:  a great 
historian, Guglielmo Fe rrero, the historian, was th
ere as historian; there was Roepke, economist, 
a liberal economi st who left Ge
rmany under Hitler; We berg, who 
was an old pacifist who was 
teaching there; Kanzel who had taught in Jena ; 
later, Rathenau, when he founded the University 
of Cologne and brought him to Colo
gne, was one of the first to be 
denaturalized by Hitler.  And I 
could continue ŒAnd there were at the same  tim
e a good number of students 
of this type which 
were supported by fellowships which came partly 
from Rockefeller and partly from the Swiss 
governme nt.  And in any case, it was an extr
emely lively and interesting institute which -- 
created really in the tradition of
 preparing people for positions in
 international life.  Many went 
to various international organizations.  Many went 
to the foreign services in their countries, and 
so on.   Now, when Nahum Goldma n approached me , 
as I said, I didn't look for any job.  I was in 
a wonderful situation.  And I really didn't want 
to change my outlook.  I often said that I was 
very interested in public law, 
state law, state and -- normally 
I would probably, without Hitler, 
have aime d at becomi ng a professor of jurisprude
nce at one of the universities.  I hadn't  given 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
18 
 
this up when I was in Geneva.   But the group which Wi se and Goldma n headed -- and this I 
knew because it was a public knowledge -- was the only gr oup -- Jewish group which was really 

fighting Hitler.  This is, w
ithout contest, the only group.  
They had already called three 
preparatory conferences, the first in
 32, before Hitler came  to power
.   In the summer of '32, six 
months before Hitler came to power , is the firs
t international conferen
ce of the World Jewish 
Congress -- before it became  a per ma nent orga
nization.  And there were two other such 
conferences, and they had gotten quite important
 publicity and it was known what they were 
trying.  So I was aware that this was the only 
Jewish group.  And it was so much in the line 
which I was educated and brought up, 
that I said to myself, "You cannot 
refuse it.  I will give this 
group three, four years of my lif
e." That was the idea.  But I happen to tell you, I got stuck with 
the World Jewish Congress.  I am there now for more than fifty-five years. 

 

Q.   Some times three or four years can be a long time.  
 
A.   It's a long time of t hree, four years, yea
h.  And then, of course, I often ask myself, "Was it 

the right decision or not?"   Of course, I often as
k myself, especially when
 in such a position you 
have to do ma ny things you don't want to do.  You come  here for the certain ideal.  You come  to 

do certain things politically, but 
you have to deal with this bur
eaucracy and this admi nistration, 
and so on, which is not what stimulates you very 
much.  So I often ask myself, " Was it right?   
Should I have not continued?   Should I --"  We ll, of
 course, the fact that I rema ined is the answer 
to the question.  I was fascinated by it and it didn'
t leave me.  It didn't -- 
the characteristic of -- 
the most important aspect was that from ti me  
to time the subjects with which I had to deal 

changed completely.  It was a fight
 against Hitler.  There was the resc ue effort in the war.  There 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
19 
 
was the rehabilitation of Jewish communities and the fi ght for Israel after the war.  There was the 
problem of North African Jewry, who are comple
tely outside of our norma l considerations, 
which came then.  And so a completely different 
aspect followed, the one, the others, and which 
all deserved support and great con
centration of labor.  And so I cam
e from one to the others and 
couldn't stop.  On the other hand, I must have 
-- could say, also, it ga
ve me  great opportunities 
even in the field in which I was 
educated.  I worked with great en
thusiasm as a representative of 
the World Jewish Congress at the United Natio
ns and the Huma n Right
s Commission, and so on, 
in the efforts for the elaboration of the Universa
l Declaration on Human Right
s.  I contributed to 
some  of the for mulations.  I worked on the fo
rmul ation of the covenants on huma n rights, the 
two covenants, international -- 
on the international convention ag
ainst racial discrimi nation, on 
the conventions of the INO and of t he 
UNESCO, discrimi nation in occupation and 
discrimi nation in education.  I was part of the effo
rt to redefine the whole 
new huma nitarian law.  
I participated in Stockholm in the Internationa
l Re d Cross Conference, and it was prepared -- I 
was an obser ver and participant in the internatio
nal conferences on the new international law, the 
Red Cross law, in 1949 in Geneva.  I participated in
 the new efforts in the seventies.  I presided 
at a commission of fifty international organizations
 to formul ate a united approach to the revision 

in the new International Red Cross protocols, 
which were later adopted.  And so I had hundreds 
of -- what shall I say -- occasions
 to use my knowledge and my trad
ition.  But it was, of course, 
not the center.  It was one of the things which 
I did. But I mu st have found sufficient satisfaction 
to continue, and, in fact, the wo
rk gave the answer to my question, which doesn't  say that I don't 
regret that I haven't written this or that book wh
ich I was -- always been dreaming of.   Now, I 
said I coul dn't  refuse this, I said.  And I accepte
d and gave up my career.  
And then I am now for 
fifty-five years in this role.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
20 
 
 
Q.   Well, perhaps you could tell us a bit more
 about your impressions of Stephen Wi se and 
Nahum Gol d ma n as you encountered them in 1936.  

 

A.   We ll, let me  put it this way:  In the su
mmer, Nahum Gol d ma n hadn't  
to offer me  anything.  
He just found out whether I was ready to.  And I 
didn't commit myself e ither -- myself, either.  
Because he hadn't to -- he  couldn't know anything. 
 The organization had first to be  established, 

and then they had to establish th
e executive, and then they coul d 
act concretely.  So he asked me , 
though, to write for him a brief, wanted to see how 
I would do it.  And he gave me  some  file, and 
asked me , "Perhaps you can write a me morandum 
about this, how you would put it."  Which I 
did, and which must have been satisfactory.  And we
 left that summer.  And my fa mi l y was still 
in Germany.  And we me t usually in the summer
 on the invitation of my
 uncle in Holland.  And 
we went and spent two weeks in Noordwijk aan Z
ee, a very nice place, where I met my  family.  
And one day I got a telegram from Nahum: "C
ome back imme diately.  We  need you for the 
preparation of the Congress."  No
t a permanent offer, but -- so I 
took the next train and spent I 
think thirty-three hours in the -- 
still wooden compartment in the old European trains, and arrived 
in Geneva, where Goldma n wasn't  - -  he wasn't  
on board.  And there was another chaotic bureau 

which gave me  an enormous dossier and aske
d me to write a brief, a memorandum for the 
assembly, the first World Jewish Congress assembl
y, which was to meet in a week's time.  And 
they wanted me  to give for the participants 
a me mo -- outlining what policy, in my opi nion, we 
should continue.  It was on the German Jewish re
fugee problem, of which I was, of course, very 
much aware.  But that doesn't mean I had special
ly studied these things from a legal point of 
view.  And I prepared fresh from vacation in a 
few days a very -- a very, very good paper, which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
21 
 
I used myself years later to look up.  When I finish
ed it, they asked me  to
 write two other papers 
about some  other problems, the problem of Danzi
g, the problem of Upper  Silesia.  And then the 
Congress started.  And nobody talked to me , and I wa
s just there.  And so 
there was great chaos, 
as always in such things, and I -- as a very orde
rly person, I tried to ma ke some order in helping 
in the secretariat, and didn't mi nd 
whether -- to do -- they give us 
small things and big things, but 
-- they ma de me  secretary of two great comm
issions, one on the German J e wish problem and 
one on the mi nority treaties and problem with inte
rnational protection.  A
nd there I saw for the 
first time  Wi se and Goldma n in action.  Now,
 Wi se was the Good great moral figure of the 
move me nt, a fantastic orator, a 
wonderful voice.  I know people w
ho went to his sermons only to 
follow -- to learn the English --  th
e beauty of his English.  He was 
really a fighter not only for the 
Jews but for all great huma n causes.  It's not 
an accident he supported the move me nt against 
child work -- what you call it?  \ 
 
Q.   Child labor? 
 

A.   Hmm?   

 

Q.   Child labor?   

 

A.   Yeah.  Child labor.  He was supporti
ng the women's mo vement.  He was supporting the 
Czech indepe ndence mo veme nt.  He was supporting 
the Greek.  He was really -- and the Negro.  
He was very, very active in fighti
ng the fight for the equalization of 
the Negro -- the status of the  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
22 
 
Negro in this country.   He was 
really the great liberal, moral fi
gure in the move me nt, and he was 
the first to have started the resi
stance against Hitler.  When I was still in Germany, I knew -- he 
ma de headlines in the Nazi press.  You can find a number of -- which I still sa w in Germany.  
They called him the "Rabbiner Wi ese."  Wi ese, not Wi se.  Wi ese.  He was really public enemy 

number one for them.  Both in Goebbel's A
ngriff and Voelkischer Beobachter there we re 
numerous cases where he made th
e headline on the first page.  And 
I knew this.  I had seen it.  
This was one of the reasons that I saw that he wa
s really the one who was fi
ghting against them.    
And he remained also a great moral figure.  He ne
ver gave up the fight, even in the worst time s.  
He was a man who -- of unusual patience, open to 
every Jew who had some  complaint.  He was 
sometimes criticized that he wasted hi s time in 
doing this instead of c
oncentrating on -- but he 
couldn't.  He loved -- not the Jewish people.  He
 loved every Jew.   It's some thing which you -- 
you don't find today anymore in this way, very rare
ly it is.  He was very courageous.  You know 
that he was a liberal rabbi, although in the e
nd he  came a little back, moderated some of his 
liberal convictions.  I saw hi m 
officiate with a kippah in -- at
 ma rriages, and so on, which in 
earlier days he didn't do.  It was a whole He
braization process, and so on, in the reform 
move me nt.  But he was, on the other hand, a ma n who had been the first to go to the Zionist 

Congress in 1989 -- in '98 sic. [Dr. Riegner mean
s 1897]  He quoted in one of the great speeches, 
the last speech he ma de to the Congress in '
48, the year before he died, in the Montreal 
Assembly, when he recalled this
 encounter with Herzl, six w
eeks after the state was founded.  
And he quoted Herzl:  "I will not see the Jewish 
state, but you will see the Jewish state," and so 
on.  It was unbelievable when he quoted this.  He
 was not a great intellec
tual.  He was a great 
moral fi gure.   The intellectual was Nahum Go
l d ma n, absolutely brilliant.  And one of the 
greatest speeches he ever ma de was a speech at 
the opening of the assembly in 1936.  You read it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
23 
 
today -- although it was even also 
a little bit censored because he couldn't -- you had to be in 
some  ways careful with regard to
 certain diplomatic necessities.  
I finally formulated some  of the 
corrections.  But this is a great speech.  So th
ere he came out and ma de a for midable impression 
on the audience. He was, as I said, brilliant.  A
nd we've come  to the problems of rescue, and so 
on.  We 'll have to come  back to some  of these asp
ects.  He saw the essential.  He could for mulate 
the essential in very short sentences, but what he 
then extracted was really the essence.  And he 
had -- I believe opinions that was later -- he was 
a ma verick.  He was provoking in the last years 
of his life -- intentionally in order to get react
ion and to educate the pe
ople like that.  The old 
rabbis of old -- he wanted to have this impact on 
the people, that they should think.  But he was a 
very highly intelligent man, very brilliant .  I ha
ve once written a piece on th
e occasion of the first 
Jahrzeit, where I called him the 
Renaissance Jew, a new Re naissance man.  Renaissance, in 

every respect.  A Renaissance personality, 
and was all what the Renaissance Mensch 
represented, and he was -- open and extremely wi
de interest, and so on.  And on the other hand, a 
ma n of the Jewish Renaissance, of course, in th
e Zionist moveme nt.  He 
was the brain, and Wi se 
was the conscience.  

 

Q.   You me ntioned so fa r that you hadn't yet agreed to take a permanent job.  

 

A.   Yeah. 

 

Q.   When did you realize -- 

A.   Well, as a matter of fact 
-- yeah.  I will tell you the stor y,
 too.  And as a ma tter of fact, I 
helped in all kinds of things during the assembly, 
and I was taken in -- there was -- this I felt, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
24 
 
there was a great movement born.  And the people 
were quite impressive people.  I me an, they 
are all dead today.  And nobody knows about them
.  But it is astonishing how many great 
characters came  to the moveme nt and each of them 
had a history of himself.  It 's difficult now to 
reme mber them.  I spoke  at the 50th anniversary 
of the World Jewish Congress in Jerusalem, and 
I name d a fe w of them.  A ma n -- Rabbi Rubens
teiner Willner , was a me mber of Parliament, 
with the Polish Parliame nt, very great Orthodox 
Je w, a very gr eat pe rsonality. Take  a ma n -- 
Anselm Reich -- Reich and Aldi Tartakover.  
They came from the labor move me nt.  Reichs 
pronounced in the -- or read in 
the Congress of 1936 on behalf of
 the whole Polish delegation a 
declaration accusing the Polish governme nt.  This ha
d never happened before.  Usually in Zionist 
Congresses, the Hungarians accuse the Poles, and 
the Czechs the Roma ni ans, and so on, but this 
is -- distributed roles.  But he
re was a ma n of enormous courag
e to do it hims elf for t he whole 
Polish delegation.   Take -- there were so ma ny.  I 
-- it's very -- really very
 difficult to name  the m 
today.  The old people from Roma ni a.
  The -- there were the -- from all the Baltic states, from -- 
but the Congress, the personalities wa s very, very
 impressive.   But on the other hand, We stern 
Europe was very underrepresented, and Ameri
ca was underrepresented, and we didn't succeed at 
the time to really have the majority of the 
We stern European communities.  The Bungdorf (ph) 
deputies of England decided with a 
vote of six, a ma jority of six, to
 refuse the cooperation of the 
Doily (ph).  And this was, of course, a great tr
agedy.   But here was a colossal potential.  And 
they -- I think we -- it's unbelievable today that  th
e unit of the Jewish people and the joint action 
of Jews is such a norma l thing, that we  have es
tablished it, how this wa
s bitterly fought in the 
three years before the World War II started.  
And there the war has completely changed the 
attitude of the Jews.  And the Jews in the We
stern countries followed their governme nt.  They 
followed the policies, the wrong policies of their 
governme nt, the appeasement policies of their 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
25 
 
governme nt, and didn't stand up, and here was one of the great lost opport
unities.  I don't know 
whether we could have changed th
e tragedy, the events.  But at 
least we should have -- should 
have tried.  And while today, even a young youth 
doesn't  understand it, this opposition, and the 
denouncing of the people who had the courage to
 stand up and preach for the united Jewish 
approach and the common fight against Hitler. 
Finally, when the Congress was over, the next 
day the executive me t, which had been elected 
the day before.  And there, the decisions on 
offices, and so on, came up.  There Nahum Goldma n 
propos ed my being selected for the Geneva 
office.  And very interesting:  There was great
 opposition.  All the people with whom I became 
very friendly later, other Jews -- the opposition wa
s, "But he doesn't  speak Yiddish." And Nahum 
Goldma n apparently -- I wasn't  at the meeting.  I 
was told later -- he said, "Well, I need him at 
the League of Nations.  There they don't speak Yi
ddish, either.  They speak French.  They speak 
English.  And this he does."  But this didn't 
make any -- any -- any impression -- and then the 
only Germa n Jew who was there in the new, el
ected executive was Georg Bernhardt.  Georg 
Bernhardt wa s a former me mber of the Reichs
tag, editor-in-chief of 
the Voelkischer Zeitung, 
which was one of the great German, liberal ne
wspapers.  He was a professor at the high 
commercial school, a university in Berlin.  He ha
d a number of other hi gh positions.  And he was 
the leader of the German Jewish immigration at that time  in Paris, editor of
 the Pariser Tageblatt, 
and the uncontested president of the German 
Jewish immi grant society.  And he stood up, and 
said -- as I was told later -- he said, "But he 
comes from a ve ry, very, very good Jewish fa mily." 
Now, that did it.  There was no argume nt.  Yi
ddish you can learn, but a good fa mily, you can't  -- 

you must have, or you don't have.  And apparently 
this convinced the people.  Very funny, but so 
it happened.  So I entered the office on the 1st of September, I think, 1936, in an office which 

didn't exist really, which I had to create.  And w
ith no budget, with a lot of debts.  And instead 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
26 
 
the salary which I got was just 
a hundred francs more than I ha
d as a student -- postgraduate 
student without having any oblig
ations.   And not only this, 
but all these gr eat pr oblems, 
financial problems, and -- and came the end of the month, I had some ti me s to advance the money 
for the secretary, and the postage, and so on, and 
so on.  And this hasn't  changed.  It has only 

grown in figures.  They were smaller amounts, 
and now it's much higher amounts.   And so I 
came in.  And -- but in reality, when -- while I 
was selected because of my legal knowledge, and 

so on, I was involved in the whole moveme nt i m
me diately, and I took as much part in the 
anti-Germa n fight as in anything else.  And I must 
say, I said I didn't regret
 the fifty-five years. 
But there is, of course, 
tne factor, also, which I should me n
tion.  Nahum Goldma n was a fantastic 
chief, generous and -- as I said, he saw the esse
ntial.  He did leave you enormous freedom.  He 
discussed with you the line, but not every comm
a  and point.  He would discuss with you the 
general ideas.  He would agree with you.   He w
ould ma ke here and there a comment ,  "Perhaps 

this is too strong," "Perhaps th
is is too weak."  And he woul
d leave it to you.  And he would 
leave you an enormous a mount of fre e dom in 
the execution of your function and give you the 
feeling of participation.  He neve
r considered me  as an employee.  There was always the feeling 
of equality.  He gave in the -- and I was what?  --
 about twenty-five yearssecretary general, first 
coordinator, and secretary general 
of the Congress.  I gave the staff, the higher staff a position of 
codecision in the Congress.  And because they 
knew, because they were underpaid, because they 
had some thing to contribute, and they shoul
dn't take the layman's opinion.  They should 
contribute to it, and there shoul
d be codecision.  And Nahum Gold
ma n understood this very well.  
And this, of course, facilitated enormously my wo
rk.  I really felt that I have contributed.  Many 
things which have gone under the name  of Goldma n ca
me  in fact from me.  I never resented that.  
We were working on a joint project,
 a joint work.  And, therefore, th
is fact.   I am not saying that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
27 
 
I hadn't a complaint.  A complaint was, on the on
e hand, we were all very badly paid.  We  are 
really idealistic workers, but we didn't  -- I often 
said -- once Israel Si eff, the great philanthropist, 
the Zionist in England, said to me , "You could b
ecome any moment admi nist
rator director of one 
of my 122 st ores in England."   I 
said to him, "This is very nice
, the nicest thing."  These stores, 
each of them, had more than a million pounds -- how
 do you say?  --Umsatz -- turnover, yeah.  So 
there -- at the time, I think 132 million pounds, which was not bad.  And I said, "Israel, it's very 
nice what you said to me .  It's perhaps the nicest
 thing.  But if I wanted
 to ma ke money, I would 
have become a banker, not a secretary of the Worl
d Jewish Congress."  And this is it.  This was 
real idealism.  And I include prac
tically all my colleagues in this.  We all worked for the cause, 
not for the money.  And we were deeply involved 
in the cause.  We lived 
it and we developed it.  
It didn't exist as a scheme.  And this was, of c
ourse, very attractive, and, therefore, I stayed.  

 

Q.   Things must have changed rather radica
lly for you when the war broke out.  I me an, here 
you were -- you were hired partly because of your
 legal expertise, you
r international legal 
problems.  

 

A.   Yeah. 

 

Q.   Now there was no legality.  Ther
e was no effective League of Nations.  
 

A.   On the contrary.  You had to learn duri
ng the war that everything 
which is legal is no good, 
and everything which is not legal has to be done. And the complete confusion of what is -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
28 
 
Q.   How di d you decide to do what you ended 
up doing, which was simp ly -- well, which was, 
among other things, to amass as muc h inform
ation as possible about
 what was going on? 
 
A.   Now, this was -- became  -- this developed 
very naturally.  The first days in the war we 
decided we had -- we have to deal -- there was 
an emergency, and the grea
t -- the gr eat danger is 
for the whole Jewish world. One of the terr ible things [for] which I will never forgive myself -- 

was the last days before the war broke out, 
there was a Zionist Congress in Geneva.  And 
everybody wanted to go home .  And I helped hundred
s of people to get transit visas to get home.  
Because I wa s the only one who had the relations w
ith several of the consulates.  And the French 
consulate -- one day worked the whole shabbat 
to get 150 passports or what -- stamped through.  
And afterwards, I said, "What have you done?"  
But, of course, nobody could foresee.  No.   
But on the third day of the war, we, for instance , communicated to the International Co mmittee 

of the Red Cross, that we had organized ourselves
 in a special little committee in which we are 
dealing with the world -- with the war affa irs, and 
that we wanted to be in contact with them, and 
we were certainly the fi rst to take this -- this in
itiative. We established -- and this was --  at that 
time not yet so important, but la
ter it became mor e important.  Th
is commi ttee, which was called 
a Relief Committee for the Wa r-Stricken Jewish P
opulation -- and it wa
s abbreviated RELICO, 
which could be a Relief Congress 
or Relief Committee, whatever you 
wanted.   It helped us to 
establish relations with the o
ccupied territories.  We couldn'
t work under the name  of t he 
Congress.  The Congress was clearly an anti-Ger
ma n, anti-Nazi move me nt, and in order not to 
endanger the people, we used from - -  from that
 September on, this second name .  For several 
years I used practically only this name.  The 
other side was diplomatic -- oh, yes -- to America 

and England.  And when the war got to its e
nd, I took out the "World Jewish Congress" again 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
29 
 
and started writing on this paper.  
And this was, of course, very helpful.  I mean, this was very 
important.  And the situation -- I have recently 
-- I have it some where here, but in my  -- 
 
Q.   Luggage? 

 

A.   In my luggage.  Statistics.  How we 
became active in all kinds of services which nobody 
could render but we in Geneva, in a ne utral 
country.  We  became a little Re d Cross, a little 
Jewish Red Cross.  We transmitted messages fr om 
one to the other -- thousands, not a few.  In 
the thousands.  In the tens of thousands.  We  
ma de inquiries where people are.  And we -- we 
transmitted money, so -- to relatives, to frie
nds, and so on.  There were hundreds of such 

initiatives.  I have a statistic in
 -- for certain months, which is 
interesting.  We had an enormous 
amount of purely humanitarian activities whic
h developed by themselves.  And you couldn't 
stop.  You couldn't say "I won't do it."  That wasn't
 possible, huma nely not possible.  And I have 
in my files letters where I plead
 with New York, "You cannot stop this here.  There is so much 
huma n hope and need involved."  And Nahum Gold
ma n left Geneva in -- in May 1940, before 
the downfall of France.  He s melled it.  He knew what he was doing.  He said, of course, he 

would come  back, and he never came back.  Bu
t he also knew that -- 
he was right, that he 
couldn't have done in Geneva political actions. He was right to decide to go to America. And 

then there wa s a mo me nt  where New York wanted to close the Geneva office.  And there is a 

very violent correspondence between New York andme .  And I just refuse
d to close.  I was 
right.  They had great financial difficulties.  Without Goldma n, they thought, well, what -- what  

-- this is how  our polling (?? )  
-- and this -- Geneva.  And I pleaded.  And the statistic which I 
have taken fr om some  of these correspondence -- 
I just refused.  As a ma tter of fact, in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
30 
 
terrible -- vielleicht [perhaps]
-- one of the greatest things whic
h I have done, one of the best 
things which I did -- in the terrible situat
ion of the summer of 1940 -- and you cannot imagine 
what that meant, the downfall of 
France, for all of us.  This was 
really the -- practically the end.  
And in Geneva, in Switzerland, it 
-- Fascist Italy, Austria, th
e Nazi Germa ny, all Nazi, now 
France, Nazi.  Where was hope?   
 

Q.   And you were surrounded? 

 

A.   We  wer e  completely surrounded.  You c
ouldn't get out norma l -- there was -- then the 
so-called non-occupied part of 
France, a little piece where you could get out, but -- this was 

really the most difficult.   And there was comp
lete chaos and me ntal despair.  And the people 
didn't know what to do.  They went to Zurich.  
Pe ople came to Geneva.  Geneva people came  to 

Zurich.  In the offices was terrible confusi
on.  What do you do?   What can we do?    And I 
decided with one of my colleague
s, Fritz Uhlmann, who was in the agency, we leave the Geneva 
offices and go on vacation in the mountains and not
 be infected by this terrible depression.  We  
have to keep our mi nds open.  We  have decided to 
rema in.  We have to stay where we are.  This 
is more important than anything el se.  There have to be some offi ces who will remain and will be 

responsible for whatever still can be done.  

 

Q.   When you thought of keeping that office ope
n, was your consideration primarily in terms of 
helping the people who needed 
help, or finding a place where Œ 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
31 
 
 A.   Whatever.  We  saw that the information wa
s essential for that.  A
nd we saw that we could 
do still very ma ny things for the people inside. 
 

Q.   So it was both? 

 

A.   Both.  Both.  Both.  And we just wanted
 to keep our heads free from the confusion and 
deterioration of the atmo sphere.  The atmosphere
 was terrible.  People wanted to run away, and 
so on.   I mu st say, Wi se sent me  in August, '40, a visa to America, one of the first emergency 

visas, which shows my personal relationship with
 Wi se.  He sent it also to Gugenheim, who 
didn't take it, and to one or two other people.  Bu
t I -- I had still a German passport at the time.  
And I put it in the passpor
t and left it in the passport.  I 
didn't have any intention.  On the  
contrary.   When Nahu
m Goldma n left, we foresaw all kind
s of it.  He bought me  a Bolivian 
passport, which was from the real consul of Boliv
ia.  I never -- this was for an emergency.  The 
situation was so frightening and so unclear, I 
had at my home  in -- a packed Rucksack, with 
shoes, and so on, to go into the mountains, if 
necessary, to di sappear, that the World Jewish 
Congress office would be -- in case of invasion or wh
at -- the first to be lo
oked after was clear to 
me .     I me a n, the fact that 
this Rucksack was packed and th
e -- some  of t he things which you 
need when you are on your own shows you the atmosphere in which you were.  Desperate.  And 

we were really desperate.   And I will tell you a
nother stor y.  We were in Switzerland.  It was the 
center of espionage.  Don't forget this, either.  On
e of my be st friends was a French vice-consul.  

When I came -- I ha d spent summer vacation in --
 partly in Holland and pa rtly with him in 
Britanny, where his family had very close friends 
really.  He was ma rried
 to a Jewish girl, 
Russian Jewi sh girl, and we were very close.
  Not only -- the whole 
group of young people. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
32 
 
I reme mber the second da y, his wife was still at
 the -- on the vacation, hadn't come  back.  And 
we ate in the evening toge ther.  He had a little ca
r.  I didn't.  And he came to fetch me .  I think 
must have been the 2nd or 3rd of September of 
'39.  And he said, "Let's  go to this and this 
restaurant, but I have to do two ot
her things before."  And he sai
d, "And you can look at it."    
And he stops before a house, takes out the ma il 
from one of the boites po
stales, the boxes, and 
puts it in his pocket and takes out 
of his pocket another from the da
y before.  And so he did that 
two or three places.  These were German offici
als, I think, journalist
s and officials at the 
international labor office, who were controlled by 
the French secret services.  And he showed it 
to me , that I should know in what situation we were
.   And I never forgot th
is.  I mean, I laughed.  
I smiled when I saw what the situation was.  
It was not gemuetlich, 
I tell you.  And became  
always less gemuetlich.   Now, so we moved in 
this fi eld sl owly fr om one to the -- then, of 
course, when terrible things happened, we organized
 ourselves to be involved and to be able to 
report.  There were no directcommunications of any kind.  So we kept the relations, the 
correspondence with the Jewish community as lo
ng as we could.  We  subscribed to all the 
Jewish newspapers.  I subscribed 
to all the offi cial  gazettes.  I 
had I think twenty-three official  
gazettes, which regularly -- you can see them I th
ink now in Yad Vashem.  I gave it to Yad 
Vashem, or the institute gave it to Yad Vashem.   
I did this for the Institute of Jewish Affairs, 
which since '40 was here in New York.  And we 
translated those into one of the languages  
that the Jews  would understand, German, or Fre nc
h, English.   I established a whole mechanis m 
how to get infor mation.  And I was helped by, for 
instance, the League of Nations library.  There 
was a ma n whom I knew very well, and so on, and 
he helped us.  He knew what we were doing 
and was a friend.  So I could take photocopies 
of some  of these official gazettes, and we 
examined them each time and we found these -- all 
these anti-Jewish legislat
ions and decrees.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
33 
 
And I made the files -- I don't know
 whether you have ever seen
 them -- at least of -- for 
Roma nia and for France and for Germany a
nd for General Gouvernement, for Boehmen und 
Maehren, for   Slovakia, and for Italy, and for the 
-- some  of t he especially
 established territories 
like Alsace-Lorraine or the Baltics where there wa
s also amilitary government, and so on.  With 
the help of some  of the League of Nations offi
cials then with the help
 of the book shop, they -- I 
subscribed, and I was "Monsieur M
ondial," who got these -- all ki
nds of -- we really organized 
ourselves in order to be able to.  And you know
, you can obtain a lot of information on this.  
Especially -- there were -- under 
Slovakian file, I think there were
 at least 150 official decrees 
and communications which I had sent to New Yo
rk and to London.  They got it all.  So we 
organized ourselves in order to be able to inform
.  This was certainly the most important thing.  I 
felt -- we felt -- and I include Gugenheim, for in
stance.  We  felt that we were encircled, and 
political decisions would have
 to be ma de outside.  Our 
judgme nt was not sufficiently 
independent.  This, we accepted from that.  That 
doesn't  mean we shouldn't ma ke proposals.  We  
ma de a lot of proposals.  And our judgme nt was 
often better than that 
of the people who were 
outside.  I am not contesting that
.  But we never felt in these th
ree years or  four from -- I am 
speaking the years from '40 on -- that the decisi
ons had to be ma de in Ne w York and London.  
And, therefore, my most important function was to
 report.   This was developed very, very -- it 
came from a political unders
tanding of the situation. 
 
Q.   You can't  ma ke decisions unless you have good information? 

 

A.   Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Now, I said, of cour
se, we had reports fr om communities, and then we 

had reports from individuals.  Some  people a
ppeared, disappeared.  Y
ou know, some  wonderful 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
34 
 
figures.  There was a -- a Dutchman, he was s
hot later -- Nijkeirk, wonderful ma n.  He  was a 
young Dutch who lived in Belgium and organized th
e Jewish youth and tried to -- you ma y have 
heard the name .  Maybe it's not on there.  He wa
s later arrested and put before a tribunal and 
shot.  
 

Q.   Let me  stop you there, because the tape is 
going to run out.  I'm going to want to ask you on 
the next tape when you started to collect info
rmation from pe ople as well as from publ ished 
sources, and when --   

 

A.   This I couldn't tell you.  This 
came  -- you just -- you couldn't get enough. 
 

Q.   Yeah.  

 
A.   On the contrary. 
 

Q.   We can talk about some of the people then, but that  will have to be on the next tape. 

 

A.   Yeah.  

 

Q.   Maybe they will gi ve  us some  lunch now.  

A.   Yeah.  All right.   

 

TAPE #3 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
35 
 
 
Q.   If you don't re me mb er exactly when you started 
to get it, that's fine, but let's talk about the 
people who -- from whom you got infor mation.  

 

A.   Yeah.  No.  I spoke about this -- this Dutch Jew in Belgium.   

 

Q.   Yes. 

 

A.   Which -- this is the type of persons -- I m
ean -- there came, of course, others, but he was one 
of the finest I -- I reme mber
.  And he came by himself. 
 

Q.   Yes.  

 
A.   Of cour se, he knew that we -- there was 
the center, and we did th
ings.  And he came to  
Lichtheim, a nd he came to me, and -- there we
re all kinds of these 
-- ther e was a -- I had 
me ntioned already Uhlmann, I think, with 
whom I went on vacation to save -- 
 
Q.   Yes.  

 

A.   -- to save the -- the office, and I saved them -- you know, the offices.  And we ca me back.  It 

was quiet and functioned.  And nobody wanted to 
run away anymore.  Now, it was a terrible 
morale breakdown, of c ourse.  And one couldn't bl
ame the m.  This was really a world which was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
36 
 
falling to pieces.  But you had to have the strength
 of character that -- 
okay, this is a volcanic 
eruption.  We have to
 wait until it's over. 
 
Q.   There was, after all, a real chance that
 Switzerland could have 
been invaded.  They had 
considered it? 

 

A.   Sure.  I told you, I had the packed Rucksack. 

 

Q.   Yes.  

 

A.   And I had the Bolivian passport, which I pr
obably never could use, but anyhow -- whatever. 
 

Q.   Do you want to tell us when --  (Discussi
on with someone off-ca mera.) I'm sorry.  I didn't 
realize.  

 

A.   Now we can start. 

 

Q.   We 'r e on.  Dr. Riegner, tell us more a
bout some  of the people who came in to you with 
information that you pr oceeded then to send out in your reports.  

 

A.   Now, I had spoke about this Dutchman.  I 
will gi ve you another example.  All are not so -- 

it's quite some ti me ago.  And my memory is not 
bad, but it has also lacu
nae.  There is another 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
37 
 
one, the Dutchman -- a Danishma n.  You ma y know
 his name because there was recently -- a 
book was published about him which is Œ 
 

Q.   Rottenberg? 

 

A.   Yeah, Rottenberg.  Rottenberg -- you know, 
in -- extraordinary times
 produce extraordinary 
people.  This I have seen time and again.  Rotte
nberg was a Danish Jew, who suddenly appeared 
in our offices -- both Li chtheim and mi ne.  We had on the same  floor, the offices.  You should 

know the same  -- in the same  building and the sa
me  floor.   We didn't know how he  came, why 
he came.  We didn't know where he went.  We  found 
out that he had -- first of all, you are very 
suspicious -- a Jew, a Danish Jew who can travel
 in Europe.  You know th
at you can trust him?   
He is a spy?   Who knows ?   We  find out -- we 
found out that he was some how protected by the 

military establishment, defense.  I was very susp
icious at the beginning.   But the man came with 
highly interesting information.  I de
finitely reme mber that he gave
 us the first information on the 
admi nistration of the Reichsbahn, of the German 
railways, sending the bills for the deportation of 
the Jews from Berlin to Riga and Lodz to the Je
wish community in Berlin.  They asked that the 
Jewish community should pay for the transporta
tion of the deportation.  For me  this was the 
height of chutzpa which the Germans had.  I was ab
solutely flabbergasted. 
 And I reported this, 
of course. The story is -- you can read it now in
 the book by a Danish Jew who heard me  me ntion  
Rottenberg in one of my lectures at the 
Nahum Goldma n fellowship.  And I asked him 
afterwards, "Do you know Mr. Rotte
nberg? "   And he, of course, ne
ver heard of him.  And when 
he went back to Denmar k, he inquired.  The story which he has now written in the book -- it's  

very interesting -- that this Rottenberg was a Ge
rman Jew who established 
himself -- I think in  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
38 
 
1907, in Denmark, became  a very successful busin
essman, had earned a lot of money, had a big 
villa and a good business, and at
 the end of the First World Wa
r was approached by the German 
embassy, if he, with the big villa he had, coul
dn't house provisionally so
me  Ger man officer who 
was in trouble.  And they agreed to it, and the 
officer came to live with him, and they became  
very friendly.  And he stayed months, several 
mo nths with him.  A
nd finally, he left, and 
Rottenberg loaned him still some  mo ney.  And then
 he wrote him a letter and the offi cer wrote 
him a letter of thanks, and said if ever he 
could do anything for him,
 he would do.  Signed, 
"Goering."   Now, in 1933, Rottenberg reme mber ed th
is and wrote a letter to Goering, who in the 
meanti me became Marshal -- Feld Marshall Goeri
ng, the second personality of the Reich.  And 
Rottenberg had some  family in southern Germany 
still, and he asked whether he could help him 

to -- to bring them out.  And Goering invited h
im i mme diately to come  to Berlin and gave him 
all the permits necessary, and the permit he left 
-- his passpor ts without J stamp, and so on.  And 
Rottenburg must have then felt that he had some  in
fluence and tried to do certain other things for 
the Jewish community in Berlin.  I ha ven't been 
able to read all the book because it's in Danish, 
so I don't know the details, but I know that he
 was in contact with a number of Jewish 
personalities like Sally Meier, lik
e Wi nfried Israel and Schwarz a
nd -- all this I didn't  know.  But 
I knew -- and we -- we established -- the author  of this book approached me  in Geneva, "Have 

you -- what is written in your files about him?
"   I told him imme diately, "You will not find 
anything.  You will not fi nd the name .  This is the type which I wouldn't put down in writing.  

But you ma y find some  of his stories."   And I to
ld him the story, for instance, about this -- the 
bills from the Reichsbahn to the Je wish community.   He said, "But you have to tell me , what are 

the dates he visited Switzerland? "   This I don'
t reme mber.  So he produced the passports, the 
passports of Rottenberg.  And we found the exactdates, and we  looked in my files, and what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
39 
 
after such dates I wrote in reports to Amer
ica or London. And the stor
y about the Reichsbahn, 
about the railway admi nistration is
 there.  Exactly after -- ther
e is no name  of "Rottenberg;"  
"From a very reliable source, I 
hear this and this and this." 
 And we found him several such 
stories.  You see, such things happened, and whether he was able to find any to say -- to help 
some  people to get out, I don't know.  I cannot read
 the other chapters of the book.   But I take 
another incident.  One of the best organized 
communities and quite courageous was the Czech 
community.  And we we re in very good relations
 with them.  And the 
-- my colleague, Fritz 
Uhl mann, who was in Lichtheim's office.  He wa
s working for the Keren Hayesod and for -- was 
in fact also a kind of "personne de confian
ce" for the Czech Jews 
and looking after their 
interests.  And he knew all the persons, and I 
knew through him most of th
em.  And Pr ague sent 
from time to time -- didn't  send -- used employees
 of the Swiss consulate in Prague to commit 
me ssages.  And the girl came to Uhlmann and ha
d learned by heart a certain number of things 
which she repeated.  Some  extre mely important th
ings: about Theresiensta
dt, about some  of the 
camps, about move ment, about Slovakia.  And th
is -- this type of initiative comi ng from the 
communities existed, too.  And so you have a whole se
ries of types of initiatives.  Later we were 
in contact with some  of the liberation move me nt. 
 We  were in contact, for instance, in Fr ance 

with the underground Jews.  At a certain mo me nt
, one of the French Jewish leaders, Mark 

Yarblum, who was a me mber of the Congress executive, came to Geneva, from France.  There 

came a number of me ssages which were sent to hi
m or to me from his groups.   My secretary, 
Vermilla Becker, who I had for nearly forty years 
as secretary, the daughter of an old Zionist, 
Julius Becker , was sometimes in the morning at
 six o'clock woken up by some  French railway 
locomotive driver who brought her a me ssage, a w
hole package of stories, reports, about what 
was happening.  These were the other initiative
s. Our names didn't figure.  Vermilla Becker 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
40 
 
wasn't  known, of course, as a person -- so they ca
me  to her home in the morning at six o'clock 
and brought her a me ssage, and such things -- a nu
mber.  There were people who were active.  
Don't forget.   We  had, of cour
se, in Switzerland, a number of 
Jewish refugees from various 
countries.  And they -- we used them.  And we
 had people fr om various nationalities who kept 
the relationship with their communit y or school fr
iends indirect to the important people in their 
community.  We ll, say, Yugoslavia.  I had one fro
m Zagreb, and I had one from Belgrade.  And I 
asked them, "Get me the information."  I used th
em, and they produced it.  We  had people from , 

this is already later, It aly, Ra
ffaello Cantoni came  -- who was th
e fi rst president of the It alian 
Jewish communities after the war.  He came 
in 1943, when Mussolini went down, and there was 
the whole group of seven thousand Italian Jews w
ho came to Switzerland.  I me t hi m.   There 
was the head of the refugee organization for the Je
ws in Italy, in Genoa, for the whole of Valobra 
(Ph).  He came  regularly to bring us reports.  
And not only on the Italian things.  He had also 
reports from other countries.  
There was a whole network of pe
ople who brought reports or sent 
reports or caused that other people se
nt us reports.  It's not -- it 
is -- not that you can plan this 
systematically, but you can produce th
e result in -- inviting people, 
and in this way we benefited 
very, very much.  But, you see, the sources are 
very, very different.  And you used everything.  
And you, of course, had to judge if what they sa
y is worth nothing.  I gi
ve you another source of 
information.  We  have to speak about the Red Cro
ss.  Here I will take one person, who worked in 
the Commis sion Mixe, the Mixed Co mmission for Re
lief, which was a joint enterprise of the  
International Committee of the Red Cross and of th
e League of Red Cross Society.  There I had a 
good friend, a Baltic baron, from Ri ga, who -- with 
the knowledge of the others or not, I doubt -- 
I think it was his own initiative.  Each time 
when the German Red Cross delegation was in 
Geneva or when was in Germany 
and brought report -- he called me . 
 This was not official.  This 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
41 
 
was -- and he gave me  detailed information what
 they had -- what they had reported in their 
private conversations, not only in official.   And 
he gave me  some  advice as to what should be 
done and how we should push the Red Cross for more, and so on.  But he also reported on some  
of -- of the atmosphere in Germany of the  
"Stimmung," of the way how
 people felt about the 
destructions, and so on, and so on.  And these we
re very important factors to evaluate the 
situation.  And you will find in my r e ports a numb
er of such -- I am not saying from whom it 
came.  I couldn't, and I wouldn't.  But I said I ha
ve very good sources, and this and this.  So there 
is -- I told you about the -- the 
written information, th
e letters came in.  Y
ou know, in -- even in 
internme nt camps, people tried to convey to you so
mething.  I don't know if we will come to it.  
We have sent -- I don't know -- I believe 100,000 pack
ages for -- to people in
 internme nt camps, 
ma ybe more even.  And they all got a postcard to 
confirm.  And I had tens of thousands of such 
confirma tions.  They are in Yad Vashem.  You 
can find them.  I reme mber there was a fa mily 

which I knew personally, and there were several si
sters.  And they got some  packages.  Some  
were paid by fa mily and some  were -- we t
ook a supplement, and out of the supplement, we 
financed gratis packages.  And the admi nistration, 
of course, we had, also.  So in the receipt s, in 
the postcards -- which, of course, was forbidden to
 write anything, but they wrote.  And one of 
the sisters infor med me  that the sister had died. 
 This was important, so -- and this wasn't  the 
only type of information.  They conveyed informa
tion which was terribly us
eful.  So it -- this 
was a chaotic time.  And a chaotic time needs all kinds of inventions.  You had not to do the 

norma l things.  You had to do extraordinary 
things.  My greatest accusation against the 
establishment in the Jewi sh world is that they 
didn't  live up suffi ciently to this extraordinary 

time, where we needed not the norma l , but the ab
norma l.  I give you an example.  The fa mous 
report on Auschwitz of the two Slovakian Jews
.  It came -- the first copy came through the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
42 
 
Czechoslovakian ambassador to the League of
 Nations.  The League of Nations had not 
recognized the disappearance of Czechoslovaki a.
  There was no ambassa dor of Czechoslovakia 
anymore in Bern, but the one in Geneva existed. 
 I used him very much, a wonderful ma n.  And I 
trusted the Czechs more than the Poles and more 
than the others.  When I needed communication 
with London which shouldn't be controlled, I used 
the Czechs.  He got from the Czech -- Slovak 
underground these reports.  Not only -- there came 
another report which is always forgotten from 
a Polish officer.   

 

Q.   Polish -- 

 

A.   Yeah.  Which also was a terrible report.  
Very, very reliable report fr om a Polish officer.  I 
don't know who it was.  And from these two Slov
akian Jews who escaped and who had done this 
for the Bratislava people.  By the way, I was as
ked later to get these two Slovakian Jews to 
Nuremberg for the trial of the BU
NA.  And I found them.  And I delivered them.  And they were 
-- this was done by me .  They asked me , " Who we
re these people? "  I di
dn't  know myself who 
they were, but I found out in Prague imme di
ately and everybody knew what -- where to find 

them.  And yeah.  And this report which came, as
 I said, to the  Czechoslovakian  ambassador, he 
gave it to Uhlmann, who was -- and said to give 
this to Ri egner and ask him to ma ke a summary 
for me .  This was -- I don't know -- thirty, forty pages, I mean. 

 

Q.   A long report.  

A.   "I have to cable somethi
ng, but I cannot cable fort
y pages.  Ask him to ma ke a summary."    
And I ma de a summary of three, four pages, wh
ich I gave to him, a
nd which I gave to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
43 
 
Americans, and I gave to the British, and whic
h, by the way, then ma de the round.  I saw it.  It 
was communicated by the American ambassador to ot
her people -- Wi nant -- and it's my report.  
Because I see that it was.  But that's not what I am
 saying.   I ge t the report and sit down to work.   
And it's a very interesting compila
tion, of course, of all of the w
hole situation of the camp, and 
then reconstruction, transport by transport, accord
ing to the nu mbers of -- two million, more than 
two million people.  And I go through the list.  A
nd I fi nd at a certai n moment a group of people 
from Prague, from Theresienstadt arriving 
in Auschwitz.  And a group of young people, under 
the leadership of a well-known Maccabee -- youn
g leader, and -- arrivi ng in Auschwitz for 
quarantine for six months.  Now, we never hear
d there was quarantine in Auschwitz for six 
months.  And a few lines after that, they were ex
terminated. And then a few lines again -- it's  the 
second such report -- transport comi ng also for qu
arantine for six months.  And I look at my 
calendar, and I see that the quaran
tine for the second group expires in five days.  I stop my work.  
I take a taxi.  I go to the Czechos
lovakian mi nister and show him 
this.  And in the taxi, I wrote 
out a telegram for the Czech governme nt.  They 
should day and night in the BBC spe a k about it, 
that we know, and so on, that this and this group 
will be -- perhaps we can'
t -- it's a crazy idea.  
It's  not a norma l idea.  And Kubetzki (Ph), who is 
the name  of the Minister 
 ?  -- has even a better 
way.  He goes to the BBC representative at the 
British embassy, a lady -- Wi ske mann (ph).  I 
knew her, too.  And he sends it to her, and sai
d, "You should do this," and it was done.  And they 
transmitted the message several time from London 
in Czech and --  Now, I never heard for years 
whether it ha d any effect.  It was a crazy idea.  
It was in this respect, an attempt to save some 
people.  Until one day I meet a ma n who wasin Auschwitz from the Czech group, Kulka, the 

father of the historian.  It was also written.  
And he told me , "Yes, I know."  I said, "How do you 
know? "   He said, "We heard this on the radio."   
I said, "You had radio?"  
 He said, "Of course, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
44 
 
we had radio.  And we were hiding these people." 
 He said -- at that mo ment these people were 
not killed.  Whether they were 
killed later, I can't tell you.  B
ecause they were distributed in 
other pl aces.   But now I am not taking any credit for 
this.  It was a crazy idea, but this is the type 
of crazy ideas you had to have to work. 
 

Q.   Yeah.  You had to try things that 
were unconventional because the situation was 

unprecedented? 

 

A.   Absolutely.  Now, take another thing.  I have me ntioned this a number of times, but it's very 

typical.  Yitzhak Greenbe rg, who was a head of the 
Hazalah in the Jewish agency in Je rusalem.   
Now, you don't know Yitzhak Greenberg, your ge
neration.  For you it doesn't me an anything.  
Yitzhak Greenberg was one of the 
great fighters for Jewish rights in the Polish Sejm (parliament) 
for the -- in the times of the terrible anti-Semitic
 events and pe rsecutions in Poland.  He was the 
one most courageous who stood up in the Sejm and attacked the government.  And we had all 

enormous respect and admi ration for the ma n who di
d this -- who had this. 
 At that time he was 
in Israel -- in Palestine.  He wa
s at the head of the Hazalah de partme nt.  One day I get a telegr am 
from Yitzhak Greenberg, "Find my s on."  I don't 
know whether you have ever heard this story.  
And I said to myself, Greenberg?   He  knows wh
at's important.  How can you find his son?   
Crazy.  And I think and think, and I couldn't sleepfor two three nights.  I said, What can I do to 

find his son?   Finally, I took a crazy
 idea.  I sent fifteen or twenty
 packages to fifteen or twenty 
camps, unde r the name  of the son.  And I found the 
son.  It wa s crazy, and I sacrificed fourteen 
packages.  Who knows what they became.  Gene
rally they arrived, you know.  We  di dn't know 
this.  But we took our list.  And New York didn't 
want us to do this.  New York said this was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
45 
 
against the bl ockade.  And I said, "I'm sitting in 
Switzerland.  I don't care.  I help people."  And 
whoever gets -- and I have the 
testimony of one of the people in
 the Unterstuetzungsstelle in 
Krakow who confirme d to me  
that practically all -- collec
tive sendings, dispatches -- and 
individual, well, you know how th
e Germans are.  They are correct.  They are correct in bad 
things, and they are correct in good things.  It wa
s received.  And it helped
 a lot of people.  I 
know -- I sent, for instance, to my old teacher, Leo Baeck, the great Jewish leader with whom I 
was bar mitzvahed.  Whe n I heard he was in Th
eresienstadt, I sent him packages.  He didn't 
know from whom it came.   I spoke to him late
r, years after, in London, and I told him it came 
from me.  He said, "Well, anyhow, we distributed 
it to some of our friends."  But you had to -- 
this was the situation.  It was ab
solutely irrational.  And you had to
 do irrational things.  And this 
is what most of the people didn't do.  Now, let's co
me to the -- to the -- I 
want to -- to come  to 
some  of the ma jor problems in the Holocaust, in 
the -- how I learned that
 -- what was done, what 
was not done, and why the people didn't -- didn't do.  These are the ma jor things which I haven't 
spoken at all yet.  
 

Q.   All right.  Why don't we lead into that 
with the receipt of the phone call from Segalovitz 
and– 

 

A.   Okay. 

 

Q.   It is fair to say that this was the -- of 
all of the pieces of infor ma
tion that you received during 
the war, this was the one that 
ma de the greatest impact on you? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
46 
 
A.   No.  Thi s  was, of course -- this was -- 
I think we should start -- how
 we got the infor mation, 
what we knew. 
 

Q.   Please.  

 

A.   When you raised the questi
on of my fa mous t e legram, I have 
to say, in introduction, that the 
world didn't begin with this tele
gram.  I think I have given you 
already the impre
ssion that all 
what we did developed in the -- 
in an evolution corresponding to 
the political situ
ation in which 
it developed.  And each situation 
incited us to make another st
ep.  You don't plan all the -- you 
plan the first step.  And then the number of steps 
follow.  And that I said
 that we have reported 
on the situation.  And it is fair to say that 
-- when you see the whole 
reporting, it's astonishing 
how well we were informed.  Once a year, for in
stance, I sent  -- together with Lichtheim -- a 
telegr am to New York, the last  on the eve of the 
Atlantic City conference, which is a resume  how 
we see the situation in November 1944 with figur
es about the dead and the living and what we 
believe is still there and what is -- it's an as
tonishing docume nt.  It's  practically what we found 
after the war.  So -- but Emerson, the Direct
or-general of the London 
International Refugee 
Organization, to whom I gave this in Nove mber 
or December of '44, asked 
me  a year later when 
I was in London, he said -- he gr
eeted me .  "Yeah.  Y
ou are the fellow with the figures."  He 
said, "How did you -- how did you know the figures?   Th
is is in fact what we
 have today."  And I 
say, "Listen, when you follow things in the way in which we followed, day by day, and week by 

week, and month by month, and year by year, you ha
ve a feeling.  You have facts, and you have 
a feeling how things develop.  And you come  to cer
tain estima tes, and they -- usually they are 
based on information."   So this is a whole pr
ocess of infor mation.  We  know very well and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
47 
 
reported on all the terrib
le things which happened in '40 a
nd '41 and '42.  Based -- the whole 
ghettoization and the terr ible situatio
n in the ghettos, and so on, in Pola
nd.  This is all -- we had.   
But then comes the Russian war, the invasion that  
-- to us.  And here is 
the great dividing line.  
From there dates really the total extermination 
policy.  On the eve --  little earlier.  I think 
May,'41.  Maybe the decision ma de -- had been take
n even earlier, not -- it's not very important, 
whether it's two, three months earlier or not.   But anyhow, the decision when -- on 

einsatzkomma ndos, it's there in May of '41.  
And you -- and we hear during the year '41, 
practically three months after the 
invasion -- we hear all kinds of 
terrible things -- about killings 
here and killings there and ten 
thousand there and five thousand th
ere and twenty thousand there.  
They are various name s of cities, and so on.  
And in October, '41, which means three months 
later, three months after the invasion, I write to
 Nahum Gol d ma n one of the letters -- didn't write 
too ma ny letters, so this is one of
 the great letters I had written.
  I said, "The news from the 
eastern front are terrible.  They'r e so terrible 
that I do not know how ma ny Jews would survive 
this war if this cont
inues."   I don't know exactly what 
happens in Russia.  We had no -- no 
possibility to reach over there.  There was no -- 
even diplomatic relati
ons in Switzerland with 
Russia, which is not known probably.  But I do 
not know -- but west of Dnieper and the Bug, I 
don't know of how ma ny Jews would survive.  
October, '41.  And then come s March, '42, six 
weeks, about, after the so-called Wa nnsee Conf
erence, of which we, of course, didn't know 
anything.  Which is also not the decisive mo me
nt but it is the mo ment in which the whole 
extermination policy is now bei
ng carried out, supported by every 
admi nistration of the Reich.  
Six weeks after we deci de  -- Lichtheim and I -- to
 go to the Nuncio, to the Papal Nuncio, and to 
appeal to the Vatican, at least do some thing in th
e countries in which  th
e Catholic church had 
influence, where there are priests at the head of 
the state, and so on.  And there's a very important 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
48 
 
diplomat of the Vatican, Philip Bernardini, th
rough whom ma ny, many of the communications 
from the Vatican went to the we
stern countries.  And yet he recei
ved us very -- very fine.  And 
asked us to write -- "Give us a me morandum."
  We give him a me mo
ra ndum, in which we 
describe in the ma jor Catholic 
countries or countries with larg
e Catholic populations what the 
situation is.  And in this me
morandum you will find several time s 
the -- a phrase like, "The aim 
can only be total liquidation."  I don't think there 
were extermination figur
es, but total liquidation 
of the Jewish community figures, which means that 
we were fully aware that
 this was happening.    
And I add some thing more.  Around the same  time , in -- I would say partly end '41, beginning 
'42, come  the first reports on experime nts on 
the huma n body, injections, and so on.  And the 
second is the gas vans.  They experime nt with 
gas vans in which vans -- in which people are 
being gassed in an Autobus and killed in this wa
y.  Not yet of ca mps and gas -- publics.  And the 
first time  you hear it, you are 
really skeptic.  And the second
 time, too.  When it comes from 
different places and different vers
ions and different people, you st
art taking it seriously.  So I am 
saying we are fully aware of the terrible things 
that are going on there.  And then comes an end 
of July.  The German ma n reports to his business fr
iends in Switzerland, "I hear of the plan of the 
total extermination of the Jews of Europe."  
And the ma n, which -- now known, the ma n, head of 

the -- Eduard Schulte, a ma n who wa s at the h
ead of a very big mi ni
ng concern, Giesche and 
Company, who occupied thirty thousand workers 
for the war, who had access to the highest 
authorities.  There was even the -- what is it call
ed -- Wi r -- it's an order, special  title of -- Wi r Œ 
 

Q.   Wi rtschaftsfuehrer? 

A.   Wi rtschaftsfuehrer.  We we
re told he had access to Hitler's  headquarters.  And come s to his 
business friends, and says, "I heard in the -- Hitl
er's headquarters of a discussed plan of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
49 
 
deportation to the east of the totality of Jews. Three and a half million to four million Jews 
should be, will be  killed in the east.  And they 
still discussed the means, but I hear of prussic 
acid."   Now, while we are receiving this, this pl
an was in full execution.  He come s back in six 
weeks later -- not even -- few weeks later, and says
, "I now know that there is an order, and it is 
in full execution."   This is always
 forgotten to be me ntioned, but this
 is a fact.  So he hims elf is 
now sure and knows.  

 

Q.   Tell us a bit specifically how you got th
is information, the other people involved.  
 

A.   Now, they -- the people involved is a Jewi
sh concern of Jack Rosenstein, who was in -- a big 

businessman in Zurich who was during the wa r in New York.  He was a friend of Nahum 

Goldma n.  He supported the Congress, Rosenstein.  
He was one of the financial supporters.  He 
has a representative, Isidor Koppelmann, who is 
in Basel and in Zurich.  And Schulte is in 
relationship with this group fo
r ma ny years.  And Schulte sa
ys to Koppelmann, "You have to 
inform the Jews officially." And Koppelmann wa s a good Jew, knows one of the Jewish officials 

in the Swiss Jewish community, a very fine huma n
 being, Benjamin Segalovitz, the type of -- the 
best type of Russian Jews, in the -- of the old 
aristocratic Russian Jewi
sh type -- who lives in 
Switzerland for ma ny, many years.  In fact, the 
family resided in Switzerland since 1914, when 
the war broke out.  And they established themselv
es in Switzerland.  And Ben Segalovitz is the 
specialist in the Jewish co mmunity on anti-Semitis
m and fi ghts and is the head of the press 

service but it's much mo re than the pr ess service.  He is really the man who is in charge of the 

fi ght against anti-Semitism with regard to the 
Swiss community.  And very respected and very 
courageous.  Stands up to his own superiors a
nd attacks them -- publicly and sometimes -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
50 
 
Koppelmann informed Segalovitz.  And Segalov
itz, without hesitating, telephones me .  The story 
that he asked himself, Whom and 
what?   It's not true.  We  were 
in constant contact.  We  spoke 
on telephone two, three times a week
 at least.  What I was doing 
in the world scene, he was 
doing in the Swiss.  We  were in very close pers
onal relations and great personal respect for each 
other.   It was a little bit -- th
ere is a certai n veil on it that in 
the later years -- where he had a new 
girlfriend who was jealous of everything else and 
tried to disturb this very friendly relationship 
with which we had.  And one of the reasons was 
in -- that Moos didn't me
ntion his name  in his 
book, which I was very sorry.  I me ntioned his name
 everywhere and gave the story and the -- it's 
not only that he deserves to becredited.  He immediately brought
 this to my knowledge.  But we 
did everything together from that mo me nt on.  And he is one of 
the finest huma n beings which I 
have been working with in my life.  I really give
 the highest credit to him 
and to his integrity and 
his competence and his dedication to all Zionists 
and -- okay.  He telephones me .  He doesn't  say 
what it is.  He said, "We have to meet imme diat
ely.  When c a n we meet?"  Two days later in 
Lausanne.  It was the first of August, national ho
lidays.  We  are both free.  And he wanted to go 
to a chess competition or some thing.  And we me et in Lausanne, and in Ouchi.  And we discuss 
for five or six hours walking along 
the lake and going into a restaura
nt or in a cafe and getting up 
again and wa lking.  And he tells me  a story.  Th
e first thing was, "Who i s  the ma n?   Is he 
reliable?  Is this a provocation?  
Is this possible?   Is this imag
inable?  Are we a victim of so me 
ma nipulation?"  And we -- from this mome nt on we 
think together.  I mean in the real -- the best 

way of cooperation.  And for hours we turn ar
ound the argume nt.  And 
I  must say, there is 
another element which -- now, we -- he and I knew 
more or less the same  things.  I shared with 
him what I knew.  And he helped bring 
about -- and people like 
him brought people who 
informed us.  And I had in my mi nd somethi
ng which had deeply impressed me .  I blink 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
51 
 
backwards.  In Witzen (Ph), 1939, half a year be
fore the war started, I had to visit another ma n 
with whom I worked together for several years who was a representative of the Danzig Jews.  
We were working against Nazis in Danzig.  Ther
e was a question of principle, not only the five, 
six thousand Jews, but also this was a city under the League of Nations supervision, that if the 

highest moral authority in the world cannot stop th
is, we cannot take this without protest.  And, 
therefore, we  fought for -- very, very symbolically, 
also.  But also really for the Jews in Danzig 
and Dresta (ph), too.  And he was one of the two 
representatives.  His na
me was -- I think Walter  
Gerson, a lawyer, one of the two leaders of the co
mmunity with whom we had to do -- to deal.  
The other wa s also a lawyer, Rosenzweig, I think.
  Was it Rosenberg or Rosenzweig?   We have 
to find out -- Bernard (ph).  And he visited me  
in Witzen.  We  made a long promenade on the 
first holiday through the campagne (i.e. open sp
aces surrounding the c
ity) in -- in Geneva 
campagne.   And, of course, the situation was terrib
ly tense.  And we knew, all of us, that only a 
war can put an end to this.  And we knew, all 
of us, that the wa r was a terrible thing.  And 
everybody was split in his own feelings.  What s
hould one wish for?  W
ithout the war, Hitler 
would never end.  With the war, terrible things
 could happen.  And then, while we had this 
feeling, all of us, he starts telling me , "You know, when the war will come , what will be  our 

destiny? "  And he paints with an absolutely fa
ntastic imagination the situation of the Jewish 

people if Hitler st arts a war, where millions of 
the Jews will --  will be 
killed and disappear.   
Now, spelling out some thing which we all felt 
so me how but we never dared say it aloud.  It 
shook me .  I  never forgot it.  It was a kind of pr
ophecy which, as I said, we felt it, but we didn't 
dare say it.  And when people say the Jews want
ed the war, it's  all nonsense.  The Jews were 
terribly divided in themselves.  What can we 
help?   What can we hope?  
 While we go there along 
the lake, this come s back to my mi nd.

A.   This you never heard. 

 

Q.   I'm sorry? 

 
A.   This you never heard. 
 

Q.   No.  I hadn't heard that before.  But I wa

in a way when -- psychologically you we

A.   I am comi ng -- I am comi ng now to
 the three reasons why I believed it. 

 

Q.   Okay.  But save that for the next tape.  

A.   We  stop now?

Q.   I think so.  I think we 'll probably have lunch now. 
 

A.   But this is a terrible stor
y.  It's  unbelievable.  You have to
 tell me  -- you have to remi nd me , 
that I say Walter Gerson.  He 
was ki ll ed i n  t h e fi rst  ---? 
 

  TAPE #4 

 

Q.   What happened, Dr. Riegner, to this 
ma n who gave you a prophecy about the fate of 

European Jewry? 

 

A.   When I reme mbered this prophecy, I had to
 reme mber his very sad end.  And the Germans 
ma rched into Poland in the fall 1939.  There wa
s shortly after a pogrom in Bromberg and in 
Poznan -- must have been in October or so -- 
where five thousand Jews were killed.  And Wa lter 
Gerson, who had fled from Danzig to the Polish te
rritories, wa s one of the first victims of this 
pogrom.  I had not forgotten this.  Now, let me 
tell you why I believed -- and I can I believe say 
also Segalovitz believed the trut
h of the story.  There were three ma jor reasons.  The first was 
that Hitler had himself announced a number of tim
es, usually on the anniversary of the day that 
he took power, the 30th of Januar y, where there were usually a gr
eat ma nifestation.  And already 
on the 30th of January 39, before the war broke out,
 he threatened the Jews
, whom he accused to 
want to push for the war, and he threatened them th
at if -- one thing is certa
in, he said.  This war, 
if it breaks out, will not end with the defeat 
of the German people.  It  will end with the 
extermination of the Jewish people in Europe.  
He repeated this threat a number of times, 
usually, as I said, on the 30th of 
January.  And I reme mbered this.  I was following this in '36 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
54 
 
already in my office.  And I was usually commen
ting on such speeches to 
a number of journalists 
in Geneva who followed together with me  thes
e speeches.  And I said to myself, we haven't 
taken Mein Ka mpf seriously.  He announced all 
what he was going to do.  And nobody had taken 
it seriously.  Here again is a th
reat.  Nobody is taking it seriously. 
 But now we cannot ignore it.  
This was the first reason.  The second reason was 
-- we are on the last of 
July, the first of August 
-- and as I told you before, we knew, of course
, many things which happened before.  We knew 
of the deportations from Berlin,from Vienna, from Prague, from other places.  But some thing 

was new.  On the 14th, 15th of July, 1942, suddenly -- and nobody understood why -- tens of 

thousands of Jews were arrested, in all great 
cities of western Europe.  In Amsterdam,  in 
Brussels, in Antwerp, in Paris, 
in Lyon, in Marseilles, and so on. 
 Suddenly, tens of thousands of 
people were arrested.  And in the week before alr
eady the first trains of 
deportations left to the 
east.  As I said, nobody understood why suddenly this
 happens. The report of Schulte gave the 
explanation.  Behind all this th
ere was a plan.  Behind all what 
we knew about the starvation, the 
terrible living conditions, the ghe
ttoization, the deportations, the 
mass mu rders -- behind all this 
was one decisive fact, a decision by 
the Nazis to exterminate the total
ity of the Jews of Europe.    
And the third reason why I believed it has very much
 to do with my own origin from Ger many.  I 
knew the Nazis.  I knew their brutality.  I knew th
eir fanaticism.  I knew that, contrary to all 
other enemi e s in history which we have encounter
ed, we have here a group which is absolutely 
fanaticized, which is absolutely determined to live up to its aims and for whom the Jew was a 

personification of the devil, the personification 
of everything evil in the world, and that it was 
one -- not one, but the central aim of the Nazi party 
program.   It is characte
ri stic that  in his fi rst 
political letter to a comr ade written in Sept
ember 1919, long before he published Mein Ka mpf -- 
it's the first document of political character wh
ich we know of Hitler unt
il his famous political 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
55 
 
last will, the day when he committed suicide, on 
the 29th of April, 1945.  In his first political 
until hi s last political  docume nt, the fi ght against world Jewry is considered by him his ma jor 
aim.  And he preaches this in 1919 as in 1945.  
 I knew about their brut ality.  I ha ve already 
spoken about my experiences as a student in the stude
nt elections.  But I have seen it, also, in my 
experience, the day when they arrived to power
, the demonstrations on the 30th of January, on 
the 1st of April, the boycotting. 
 I knew about who had burned the Reichstag.  When I left in 
May 19 Œ 

 

Q.   '33?   

 

A.   -- '33, I knew about the first concentrati
on camps, in Or anienburg, and in -- other place 
which escapes me  at the mome nt.  I knew aboutthe torture of his political enemies which took 

place in the building of the for mer Communist 
newspaper, the Rote Fahne.  And everybody who 
was a little bit interested 
in the political affairs 
knew it.   I knew about the violence with which 
they fought their political enemies.  There was 
a famous story about the murder in a Polish -- 
German Polish fr ontier city, which -- in which th
ey ruthlessly turned the facts upside down, and 
we knew that   the German Nazis were full offanaticism and did not know any ethical or moral 

limits to their exercise of power, that for them
, good is what benefits Germany, as the Nazis 
understood it, was the essence of th
eir doctrine.  And in this, the 
Jewish question was the central 
point.  Now, I did not limit myself
 t o convincing myself that all th
ese reasons ma de the report of 
Schulte very probable and very nearly convinced myse
lf that it is an accurate report.  I told so, 
also, the American vice-consul, w
hom I me t.  My idea after having 
me t together with Segalovitz 
-- Koppelmann, who confirme d what Segalovitz had re
ported to me , who told us a little bit more 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
56 
 
about his relations with Schulte, 
his reports which he had brought
 before with regard to the 
development of the war.  Amongst other things, he 
had rightly informed them of the date of the 
invasion of Russia.  And a number of other simila
r reports turned out to be completely correct, 
which gave us the conviction that we  had to 
do with a very serious 
source.  And this -- 
 

Q.   At this point you still didn't know his name ?  

 

A.   At this point I didn't still 
know his name .  I didn't want to see him, and he didn't want to see 
us.  Don't forget:  We  are, after all, at war 
with Ge rmany, and the whole situation was terribly 
tense, and -- but the reports about his reliabi
lity and his antecedence gave us a good measure of 
conviction that we had to deal with a very seriou
s source.  I decided to 
keep the whole story to 
myself, and only to consult Professor Gugenheim, 
who was our legal advisor.  And when Nahum 
Goldma n left Geneva in 1940, he asked me  in ve
ry serious problems to consult Gugenheim as a 
ma jor person with whom I should be in contact.   I had written the same  evening a long letter to 

Gugenheim.  I told him what I f
ound out and told him what I had 
intention to do and wanted his 
consent.   And he spoke to me  the next day on th
e telephone.  He agreed to the plan.  As a very 
careful, prudent, good, Swiss citizen, he moderate d some  of my phrases and introduced some  

cautious words. 

 

Q.   These were the phrases that were in the te
legram you proposed to send out to the Americans 

and the British? 

A.   Yes.  I made a draft of a telegram which I wanted to gi ve the Americans and the British, and 

he moderated this a little bit, but the basic -- 
some people later have accused me , "But you didn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
57 
 
believe yourself.  You have put in some  cautious 
words."   But if you would see what I sent to 
the American vice-consul  -- the consul was not 
in Geneva.  He was on vacation -- and to the 
British vi ce-consul, you would see, and -- Mr. El
ting, who was the American vice-consul, has 
written about this, gi ven some  infor mation of 
it -- you will see that I wa
s very strong in my 
convictions.  And I told them, in spite of these wo
rds, that I was convinced that the things were 
serious, and I gave him all the re
asons why I believed in it.   Elting must have consulted his 
chief, Mr. Squire, a consul, whom I knew.  Elting 
I had never me t.  And th
ey agreed, and he sent 
the text to Be rn legation, and that they should 
forward everything to Wa shington.  I said, in fact, 
three things to Elting:  "Inf
or m your governme nt, check the contents, what I tell you.  You have 
the Secret Se rvice.  I don't.  And three, give 
this telegr am to Wi se, the president of the World 
Jewish Congress, in Wa shington."   And I said 
the same  to the vice-consul of the British, and 
asked him to give the -- send the telegram to 
Mr. Sydney Silverma n, who 
was the chairman of 
the British section of the World Jewish Congre
ss and a very pr ominent me mber of the British 
Parliame nt.  In fact, the two telegrams were id
entical, with one exception, 
and it's very typical, 
the exception.  The telegram to Silverma n said 
at the end, "Infor m and consult New York."  
Now, as I had sent the other telegram to Wi se, 
it doesn't  make much sens e, but it shows that I 
was not convinced that the Americans would de
liver the telegram to Wi s e , and that I was 
convinced that the British, because of their parl
iame ntary traditions, woul d not dare not deliver 
the message to a prominent me mber of Parliament
, and my guess was true.  It happened exactly 
like this.  The Americans did not deliver the me ssa
ge to Wi se and informe d me  so by letter from 
Mr. Squire, the American consul, on the date of 
the 24th of August, in which he writes that 
(reading) "I  am informed that the legation at  Bern transmitted the substance of this telegram to 
the Department of State for deliv
ery to Dr. Wi se in its discreti
on, but it is now in receipt of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
58 
 
telegraphic instructions fr om the departme nt which 
indicate that it is di sinclined to deliver  the 
me ssage in question in view of the apparently un
substantiated character of
 the information which 
for ms its ma in theme." Now, I don't know what 
I could have substantiated more.  I know we 
know from s o me  of the historians who have studie
d the files in the State Departme nt that some  
people were afraid of Wi se, and if the rabbi finds 
out, he will ma ke a big scandal.  But this is 
only the fi rst instance of a very unfriendly attitude of the Department of State in this whole 
ma tter.  With regard to the British, they de
livered the me ssage to Sydney Silverma n, although it 

took ten days, and I never found out why.  Appa
rently they looked for him in London, but the 
parliame ntary session was finished, and so he wa
s at home in Liverpool 
and -- but it's not clear 
why they couldn't find him earlier.  Finally, they
 found hi m, but he didn't believe in the thing, 
either.  And you study today the files which have b
een published -- after all, this is now public -- 
to a great extent, at least -- public property, 
you will see the marks in the file of the State 
Departme nt:  "These are wild rumors borne out of
 Jewish fears."  For the fi rst ten or fourteen 
days, or even more, nobody cared for the substance, what I had informed.  They only asked, 

"Who is Rie gner? " And my na me  wa s at that 
time completely unknown, for several reasons.  
One of the reasons, that my fa mily was until th
e end of 1938 still in Germ
any, and I had asked all 
colleagues in the Congress to keep my na me  ou
t of circulation and out from docume nts.  So 
nobody had seen my na me .   And when they aske
d in London at the Jewish agency and some  

other pl aces, they didn't know me , either, because 
I had nothing to do with them.   So this was 
only -- slowly when other reports came in in the 
same direction, with the same content, they 
finally started to give some  Œ 

Q.   Credence, believability? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
59 
 
A.   Yeah -- believability to these reports.  A
nd I am -- some  of the historians have shown that 
my telegram finally has completely changed the at
titude of the British go
vernment in the case -- 
on the whole subject of war crimes and war criminal
s.  Now, when the telegram was received by  
Silverma n, he tried to telephone to Wise in Am
erica and was prevented by the War Department 
to do so.  Finally, the War Depa
rtme nt sent a coded telegram 
to Wi se in New York, from 
Silverma n -- and it is only when this arrived 
in Ne w York, was fully informed.  Now, the 
question about how did the Jews react to -- let'
s say the Congress people?  This is some thing 
which I am, of course, interested
 very much, and I have three or
 four witnesses on which I can 
report.  I asked my colleague in New York, 
Morris Bernzweig, who was the head of the 
International Affa irs Departme nt in New York 
-- who was British, but during the war he  went to 
New York -- and asked him, "How did you react to
 this?   You were pres
ent when the telegram 
arrived.  Did you believe it, or did you have doubt
s?   What? "   He said clearly to me , "Nobody 
put this report into question.  We took it.  We 
accepted it."  As a ma tter of fact, Stephen Wi se, 
when he got it, wrote two letters, deeply -- which 
he is deeply worried, deeply moved, deeply in 
despair, one to Justice Fr
ankfurter, and he writes in a few lines that he received this me ssage, and 
that he is in despair.  What 
could one do?   And he asked Frankfurter to inform the boss, which 
means Roos evelt, which Frankfurte
r has certainly done.  They were 
in very close relations.  And 
he underlines -- and this is very
 funny for me  -- that the report 
come from one whom he names 
"very conservative."  Now, I have never b
een described by anybody as a very conservative 
person, but what Wi se obviously meant, that I am 
very careful in my judgme nt, that I am not a 
"Schreier", and that I am known fo
r my reliability and for my good j
udgment.  It's interesting to 
see such -- such words to appear when you feel
 you are really not a ve
ry conservative person.  
But -- in this sense of reliability and not exagge
rating, and so on, it is very accurate.   The other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
60 
 
letter is even a much greater e
xpression of despair, to his very close friend, the Pastor John -- 
James -- Holmes -- Hanes.  What's the name?   Th
e pastor and the mi nister, the name  -- you have 
to correct that -- the -- it's one 
of the closest fr iends -- a Prot estant pastor  with whom Wi se was 
very close, and they exchanged 
the pulpit even, and so on.  And th
ere is in the letters which Foss 
has edited, an outburst of his despair, "What can we
 do? "  And sees that he is absolutely shaken 
at his foundations about this re
port, and sees the catastrophe a
nd takes it for serious, too.   I 
mean, there is no doubt.  He has known me  in '3 6 
at the Congress.  He has known me on one or 

two other occasions when we me t and had obviou
sly great respect for my  integrity and my 
reliability.  And Wi se goes to Sumn er We lles and 
-- not knowing, of course, that the telegram is 
laying in the State Departme nt 
-- and Sumner We lles forbids th
e publication.  There are people 
who criticized Wi se that he 
accepted this.  I don't know whether he was right or he  was wrong.  
But he agreed that they will make other inquiries 
about the reliability of th
e content, the veracity 
of the content of the cable, and 
has decided to ask th
e Vatican and the International Re d Cross 
for their opinion.  Now, the Vatican -- this I have
 described in one of my s peeches in Cincinnati 
has a very strange attitude.  Titmann, who was th
e deputy to the official 
representative of the 
president to the Vatican, insist s a number of tim
es to get information of
 the attitude of the 
Vatican on this information.  And finally, he gets
 a wishy-washy reply: 
  "We know, also, that 
there are very bad reports comi ng in about the tr
eatment of the Jews, but we have no onfirma tion 
about the story of the extermination."  And more or
 less this is the reply.  
Very strange.  Because 
the -- I believe the Vatican was at least as well
 infor med as we were.  They had hundreds of 
priests who came -- traveled through Europe 
and came to Rome and infor med the Vatican 
authorities.  A ma n, historian, form
er priest hims elf, Franconi, Ca
rlo Franconi -- writes about the 
hundreds of reports who came and -- from all over and how much they -- how well they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
61 
 
informed.  And in the docume nts which the Va
tican has published themself, there are a number 
of very important facts, where 
you see that a number of Nuncios 
had very clearly reported about 
what is happening to the Jews.  There was a sp
ecial ma n who was active, I believe, for the Order 
of Malta, who was pursuing in Poland some  welf
are activities, humanitarian activities, who 
writes a number of times reports 
already in May, and another in October, '42, where he -- one of 
the reports he says some thing like "There 
are two new things.  On the one hand, the 
bombardme nt of the cities, and the 
ot her is the intensification of the extermination of the Jews.   
More than two million ha ve already been killed." 
 I mean, this information was there.  Why the 
Vatican ignores it and doesn't tell it, I don't 
know.  And the Red Cross didn't give any -- any 
concrete answer, either, Internati
onal Red Cross.  Now, we wi ll come
 back to the attitude of the 
Red Cross at a later point, where I will say what 
I have to say about the Red Cross.  Now, I see 
that one doesn't believe -- but doesn't believe, 
and there is now on -- two 
activities on parallel.  
The one activity is my own.  I try by all of 
the possible means to find corroborating evidence 
from other sources.  And the other is the activit
y especially of our British section, which was 
very active, was a wonderful group, of Lady R
eading, of Silverma n, of
 Baru(ph), ofAlex 
Easterma n, of -- a ma rvelous leadership group which 
was acting in a very fine, coordinated way.   
And they approach all the governme nts in exile, 
the British governme nts, and try to work on 
them.  And an interestin
g story there is that one of their be
st friends was Pr esident Benes of  
Czechoslovakia, considered it a 
German provocation and didn't believe in it.  And on the other 
hand, the only one who believe d it, accepted it as 
fact, was Ivan Maisky, the Russian mbassador, 
who probably had known by his own experience that
 the extermination of peoples is possible, 
even by so-called civilized countries.  At the sa
me  time, they tried to obtain some  kind of a 
statement of the Pope, through a 
concerted action of the countries
 represented in London -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
62 
 
taking up an idea which I had already a year earl
ier suggested in one of my letters to Nahum 
Goldman -- there is an attempt to obtain a colle
ctive statement of the Allied governme nts on the 
extermination of the Jews. And this text is fina
lly -- this is the real, immediate result of my 
telegram, is the declaration of the -- all the 
Allied governme nts -- which is of the 17th of 
December, 1942, where all the Allied governme nt
s and the French National Commi ttee -- was 
not yet a governme nt -- had solemnly denounced th
e extermination of the Jewish people, saying 
that this has been ma ny times announced, threat
ened with, and now it is happening, and hundreds 
of thousands of people have already been killed, 
and they threatened with
 the retaliation -- with 
the punishme nt of those who are re
sponsible.  This is a great mo
me nt.  Now the story is out.  
And it is published all over.  And even in the 
very careful, neutral Switz
erland, it makes the first 
pages in the newspapers.  And one hopes now 
some thing will happen that some thing should 
happen.  And now starts a discussion between 
the two ma jor Allied 
governme nts which goes on 
for six weeks, and nothing is happening.  You can 
read the pathetic appeal from the Archbishop 
of Canterbury in the House of Lords and this, 
where he accuses the governme nts of complete 
inactivity and of being responsib
le for their not undertaking a
ny action.  Even if you cannot do 
anything, you have to try at least.  And finally, 
after two months practically, it is decided there 
will be a conference between the British and the 
Americans, and they deci de to hold this 
conference in the Bermudas, in the Atlantic. 

 

Q.   Let me  stop you there for a mi nute and back up for two things.  One, the information that 

Washington and London were trying to get confirme d, in
 spite of the fact that the Vatican did not 
supply muc h information, the Americans did ultimately get additional information, including 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
63 
 
indirectly some  infor mat ion from Carl Burckha
rdt, and I wonder if you could talk about how 
that... 
 

A.   Yes.  I will come  to this now.  I have 
skipped one thing, and that
 the meeting with the 
American minister in October 
1942.   Let me  first say, when I 
saw that nothing was happening 
and that everybody was skeptical 
about the reports -- 
and this you feel, an
d you see that nothing 
is happening  I was never in my life as desper
ate as during these weeks, when you know that the 
world is burning and nothing is happening, and on 
the contrary, I am sitting in Geneva on this 

beautiful lake with my view on the Mont
 Blanc, and the blue sky, and you know -- 
 

Q.   Which you could see from your office? 

 

A .    H m m?   I  s a w  t h i s  fro m my  
offic e .  I was having an office w
ith a beautiful view, and already 
three, four kilome ters around are the Germans an
d the Italians.  And the whole world is in 
flames, and you see this beauty of the lake and 
the mountains and the sky, and it's a provocation 
to your existence.  And I am waiting and waiting 
to any reaction positive, and nothing come s.    
So I am trying to -- to get information, other in
formation.  But on this I must say I was quite 
successful.  There were four ma jor confirma tions 
which I obtained, direct or  indirect.  The first 
were some  letters which were addressed to th
e Jewish relief organization of the Aguda in 
Switzerland, addressed by a ma n 
who lived outside the ghetto in Wa rsaw, and which was sent to 
Lucerne, informing them in a certain coded lang
uage, with Hebrew words and other words, of 
the beginning of the deportation of
 the Jews of Warsaw, which started -- and this we know -- on 
the 25th of July, the day when Czerniakow, the Ju
denaelteste, committed suicide.  And every day 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
64 
 
six thousand people were taken and -- from the Um
schlagplatz to Treblinka
.  And they write in 
two letters in this kind of coded language th
at the people are being ta
ken day by day to this 
camp.  And the words are clear -- 
it is gayROOSH.  It is complete
 extermination and killing, and 
so there is for the fi rst time a confirmation even fr om Poland that this extermination is happeni ng 
there.  Number two, at the beginning of Sept
ember, I believe, come s to Switzerland a young ma n 
who saw the extermination of the total Jewish 
population of Riga in November and December 
1941.  That means nine months or ten months 
before.  A young ma n, a student of me dicine, who 
escaped from Riga, worked for several months 
in a hospital as a non-Jew, and a hospital in 
Stettin, and finally succeeds to 
get a visa for Switzerland where 
he has some  relatives.   And 
when he arrives in Geneva, I am informed, and I 
have a meeting with him,  and I question him for 
six or eight hours a
bout what he knew, and he gives a very
 detailed report of how in two nights 
the Nazis -- ? , was military -- ki lled by machine 
guns -- I think thirty-six thousand or so mething 
Jews in two nights, among whom the very famo
us Jewish historian, Simon Dubnow, who was, 
by the way, very near the ideals of the World Je
wish Congress and whom we revered very much.  
Nobody knew about this.  For nine months the worl
d was completely silent, that you can't kill 
such -- do such extermi nations without anybody 
knowing.  It showed that -- what was going on 
was terrible.    The third was even more intrigui
ng.  One day I get a telephone call from a doctor 
in the Jewish -- in the hospital, a Jewish doctor in the hospital of Geneva, very fine lady, good 

friend of mi ne, said, "Come here.  I have to sh
ow you some thing very inte
resting," and it's worth 
my comi ng.  And I go to the hospital, and she receives me  -- she's dead also now -- and says, "I 

have here a very strange patient.  He is under po
lice surveillance, and you 
are not allowed to see 
him, and you are not allowed to 
me ntion it, but I cannot begrudge. 
 You know much more the --  
go and see him."  And I spent six hours in the ho
spital and take down what this fellow tells me.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
65 
 
And it's -- as I always say, in extraordinary tim
es are extraordinary ev
ents.  A young man who is 
taken in -- Antwerp or Brussels -- 
this I forgot -- in Belgium, in
 one of these ma ss arrests, and 
being sent to the camp in Malines, from where they
 are deported to the east.  And he gives me  
the exact description on what happened every day 
in the process of depor
tation, from Malines in 
Belgium to Krakow, Katowice, up to Russia, where 
he finally ends up in -- near -- the front of 
Stalingrad, near Rava Ruskaya.  And then he 
describes every station, wh
at happened, and so on.  
Not only he tells me  he was in -- put down, put to 
-- engaged in works for the fortification at  the 
front.  And one day, an officer come s and asks 
some body whether -- who coul
d drive?   He needs 
a driver.  And as he is a mechanic, working in 
-- was a Polish Jew living in Belgium, working in 
some mechanic(al) establishment, he offers himsel
f, and he is taken.  And he is -- ten days going 
with the German officer, accompanying him in his tr
avels in the car.  And he uses this pportunity 
to ask the German officer, "What happened?   
Wh at happened there?  What  happened here?   
Why? "   And the German officer, who is fed up with the war, lost already two of his brothers, 
tells him, "It's very simpl e .  Those who are up to
 work, they take them to work.  Those who are 
not up to work, they be exterminated.  Those w
ho are not any more up to
 work, they have the 
same  fate." So easy it wa s.  In three sentence
s, the whole tragedy of
 the Jewish people was 
described by this German officer.  And the Germ
an officer, as I said, who was fed up with the 
war, decides to save this Jew. 
 In an unbelievable story, he hide
s him in a train full of uniforms 
of people who fell in the battles around Stalingra
d, and hides him in this train and gives him food 
and gives him occupation ma rk, and said, "You rema
in in the train until it stops.  And then you 
can try to get out." And he leav
es -- I don't know -- four or five
 days.  He didn't know himself 
how long it was.  And fi nally this
 train stops.  Finally, didn't move
 any more.  And he gets out, 
and he is near the Gare de l'Est in Paris. No
w, you imagine from Stalingrad practically, or Rava 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
66 
 
Ruskaya, to -- to Paris.  And he -- he has some
 occupation marks.  He 
finds his way, he goes to 
the Plaetzl, fi nds Jewish advice, goes to the 
nonoccupied France and finds the way.  He come s 
over the mountains of Switzerland and is arrested by 
some  of the soldiers, and as he is typical -- 
as for ma ny people deported -- swollen feet and 
-- and bones and legs.  They bring him to the 
hospital to be treated.  And there he is.  Unbe
lievable that such things are possible.  But I 
questioned him.  You know, I was a kind of a ju
dge once -- inquisition judge in the proceedings 
which I had in the tribunal in 
Berlin.  And I questioned him fo
r hours and hours.  Very simple 
person, straightforward, and there was no doubt that wh
at he said was the truth.  And yet he gave 
the whole story.  From a n eyewitness who had s
een it.  And then come s the fourth, the most 
interesting in certain ways.  When we had th
e idea -- we had the report from Schulte.  I 
suggested to Gugenheim that we should ask th
e Red Cross whether they had any reports which 
confirme d.  And ma king it not too 
official, we decided that he
 should privately ask the vice 
president of the Internat ional Committee of the 
Re d Cross, Carl Burckhardt, who is a colleague 
of his in the institute which I s
poke, the Institute de Hautes Etude
s Internationales, and he should 
ask him in the professors' lounge -- not in a formal
 way, but in a more private, confidential way.  
And he does this, and -- some where in the beginni
ng of September.  And Burkhardt confirms  to 
him that his reports are very si
milar, that he has confirma tion 
from two Ge rman diplomats, the 
one from a me mber of the staff of the German fo reign office, the other, 
a representative of the 
military establishment.  He says "Defense Department." 
 

Q.   Wa r Ministry, yeah. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
67 
 
A.   Wa r Ministry.  It seems that this was not 
a very correct description, but it's clear that he 
meant the military establishment.  And very in
teresting.  He uses the words which are the key 
words in this whole process that means "Judenf
rei", ma ke the countries "Judenfrei."  When you 
read the reports which Heidrich ma de to Ribbent
rop, the regular reports about the progress of the 
extermination process in the vari
ous countries, in all of these 
reports, you see "Judenfrei."  And 
Burckhardt knows -- says "Judenfrei" as he says, well 
-- there is no possibility of settleme nt or of 
emigration.  It is clear that it m
eans in reality the killi
ng of the people.   Now, this, of course, is 
extremely important.  And Gugenheim was doubtful 
whether I should use this information.  In 
any case -- I will come to it in a mo ment -- shor
tly after, we were invited by the American 
mi nister in Bern, Lichtheim and my
s e lf, to report to him what we knew about the whole process.   
This was suggested by Wi se to Sumner We lles,
 and -- and we were invited by the American 
mi nister.  And knowing what it was all about, be
cause Wi se infor med us, put all what you have 
on the table to let people -- I saw they didn't believ
e us.  Maybe now is the mo ment or never.   
And we write together a me morandum of about thir
ty-five pages, with a 
short introduction.  And 
then we add all the reports which we have and so
me  general evaluation of the situation in various 
countries, with all the annexe
s and the documents, including 
these letters from Warsaw, 
including the Sivian (? ) report, 
including the report from the ma n who wa s in Rava Ruskaya and 
Stalingrad.  All together it'
s about thirty-five pages. 

 

Q.   Stop there.  Because they'r e about to run 
out of tape.  We 'll talk about your meeting you and 

Lichtheim, meeting with Harrison. 

 

A.   Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
68 
 
 
Q.   Okay.  Save that for the next tape. 

 

A.   They have to change?   

 

Q.   Yes.   

 

Q.   Dr. Riegner, you were about to tell us
 about the information, the me morandum you brought 
in for the American mi nister, 
Leland Harrison, in October. 
 

A.   Now, I felt very seriously that  this was the d
ecisi ve date.  Either they will believe us or they 
will not be lieve us.  And, therefore, I was decide
d to tell all I knew, including the name  of the 
person from whom the original report came. 
And we agreed that we would not pronounce the 
name , but we would put it on a pi ece of paper and gi
ve it to the mi nister in a closed envelope, 
and this is what happened.  On the other hand, I al
so decided that I had to infor m the minister 
that the --  about the Burckhardt interview of 
Gugenheim.  I fe lt that this was an extremely 
important, positive support for our whole stor y, and I had to tell it.  Gugenheim was not very 

happy about this.  He felt it was more of persona
l information, and I disr
egarded it and told the 
mi nister the whole story.  I said
 to him that I doubt that Gugenheim woul d confirm it in this way, 
but without nami ng the person, he ma y.  It was  -- 
the meeting with the mi nister was extremely 
interesting.  He read -- I never ha
d such a meeting with any diplomat in my life.  Whe n he saw 
that we had prepared the me morandum, he imme di
ately took it and started 
reading it.  We were 
in the room for probably twenty-f
ive, thirty mi nutes without any word was spoken.  When he had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
69 
 
finished, he started again and 
asked questions.  What he thought of it, we couldn't guess.  
Lichtheim, with a good sense of humor, said, "M
r. Poker Face."  And he  looked like  a poker 
face.  But as a ma tter of fact, as we know today, we convinced him on that date.  He di dn't 
believe  us be fore.  But the documentation, it convinced him, and he obviously gave a positive 

recommendation.  I don't know.  You ma y have readed
 -- read what exactly he wrote.  I have 
never seen it. But it is clear that from that 
mo me nt on, he was on our side.   He asked that 
Gugenheim should ma ke an affidav
it about what we told him, a
nd he asked an affidavit from 
Sivian, and the name  of t he other fellow was -- wh
om I met in the hospital I didn't give him.  I 
didn't want to ma ke trouble for the doctor who let us
 in.  But I gave it later in a special letter to 
the embassy so they knew, also, that the ma n -- and ma ybe they have approached him.  I don't 

know. 

 

Q.   Sivian was the Latvian who desc
ribed the massacres outside of Riga? 
 

A.   Yeah.  But the -- the other fellow was -- 
not -- the name escapes me at the mo me nt, but I 
have it if you want.  And I gave him -- gave them
 the address, too.  He was in the me antime in 
some  of the internme nt camps in Swi t zerland.  
 Well, then -- then some thing happened which I 
didn't know.  He sent the consul in Ge neva, 
Mr. Squire, to Burckhardt behind our back, and 

interviewed them, what he knew about the exte
rmination policy and what he knew from the 
Germans.   And as a ma tter of f
act, Burckhardt repeated to Squire 
exactly what he had told us.  
There are two notes from Squire which Mr. Moos 
found in the files of th
e St ate Departme nt and 
which he sent to me  afterwards.  It is exactly th
e same  what he said to -- to Gugenheim.  That -- 
the very strange fact rema ins that Burckhardt ha
s never said these things
 to his own colleagues 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
70 
 
on the International Committee of the Red Cro
ss.   Professor FalVAY, who  had access to 
everything -- all the files in the International 
Red Cross, who has seen practically everything, 
confirms that there is no trace whatsoever of this
.  And the strange thing is
 that Burckhardt tells 
very proudly to Squire that ther
e was a proposal of -- ma king a pr
otest or appeal to the Germans 
on the part of the Red Cross, and he -- he doesn't
 tell him that he was against it and voted against 
it and st opped it.  He presents it as if this wa
s a great positive fact which he  supported.  Now, 
these are very strange things.  And it's not very 
clear.  I have my ideas about this, why he did 

this. 

 

Q.   Do you want to tell us what you -- 

 

A.   I think it should really come  somewhere else. 

 
Q.   All right.  
 

A.   It doesn't  fit in in the st
ory at the mome nt.  But when we 
speak about the Red Cross, we can 
perhaps come  back to it.   So when this -- al
l these documents are arriving in Wa shington, in 
Nove mber, then everybody is now convinced that we
 -- we have a case and we are right.   Three 
months or more have passed.  Every day, thousan
ds of Jews have been killed.  And nothing has 
happened in the meantime.  But now Sumner well
es allows Wise to go public, and he does.  
Some  people say it wasn't  published in -- suffici
ent publicity.  Maybe yes, ma ybe no.  In any 
case, the ma tter is public.  And this now leaves -- 
and here I made a mi stak
e -- I went already to 
the Declaration of the 17th of December.  Perhaps 
we can turn this around in the tape.   We  -- we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
71 
 
get to this Declaration which was published 
simu ltaneously in Wa shington, in London, and in 
Moscow on the 17th of December, and -- denouncing 
the extermination of the Jewish people and 
threatening the responsible with 
punishment after the war.  In L
ondon, it is done in the for m of a 
question in Parliame nt to the governme nt, and 
Sydney Silverma n asked this question, which 
Eden replies.  And a very moving gesture:  Th
e whole Parliame nt stands up for two mi nutes to 
pay tribute, homa ge to the victims.  And a ma
n -- Eden himself says he was struck by the 
emotion which prevailed in the House.  And 
a ma n like Lloyd George, who was the oldest 
me mber of the Parliame nt, said he  ha d never se
en anything alike in the history of the British 
Parliame nt.   But this, of course, didn't ma ke
 the people alive again.  And we wait now for 
action.  And as I said, there are negotiations, and 
finally it is decided to meet in the Bermudas 
and to discuss what action is to be taken.  This 
is the mo me nt  where the Jewish organizations in 
America, everywhere outside in the fr ee world, ge
t very active and devise 
an actions program of 
what should be done and what can
 be done.  And this program is being formulated and -- with 
fifteen points.  We  ma y be comi ng back on some  
of the points when we say what happened and 
what didn't happen.   In any case, 
it's not true that the Jews were not prepared for action, but the 
governme nts were not prepared for action.  That is 
the truth.  And Ber muda is chosen so that the 
-- the public cannot follow too much what's
 going on.  Nobody is allowed access to the 

conference.  The whole thing is ke
pt  in great secret, and the gr eat 
secret that only come s out very 
slowly -- the great secret is that  they didn't decide anything.  Now,
 when this become s true, when 
this become s public, when this gets out, this is 
the most crucial mo ment in the whole history of 

the war for the Jewish community.  And the peopl
e are completely shaken.  Yitzhak Greenberg, 
one of the very respected me mbers of the Jewish
 community here, of the labor -- Jewish labor 
move me nt, writes a famous article, "Bankrupt," a
nd at this moment, in effect, it was co mplete 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
72 
 
bankruptcy.   Now we come  later back to the 
reason why nothing was undertaken.  But here the 
most important thing is this:  There have been at
tacks later against the le
adership and especially 
against Stephen Wi se and the Zioni
st leadership that they di d 
not use their influence to push 
through a program.  And they are accused of havi
ng sacrificed the rescue effort to the -- 
 
Q.   Zionist cause? 

 

A.   -- to the importance of the fight for the esta
blishment of a  Jewish state.  This is, in my 
opinion, a very unjust accusation.  They -- one puts th
e cart before the horse.  In reality, what has 
happened is that for the first time, the Jewish 
establishment understands that it cannot in this 
tragic situation count on our best
 friends.  It's  a bankruptcy of the effort of rescue, which puts 
everybody into the position that if we cannot count 
on our best friends in su
ch a tragic situation, 
then we have to have ourselves some sovereignty so 
that we can act.   It is
 not the sacrifice of the 
rescue effort to the idea of establ
ishment of a st ate.  But the establishment of the state is the aim 
-- the first aim in the Jewi sh war aims.  It is 
the consequence of the bankruptcy of the rescue 
effort, of being abandoned by our best friends
 in whom we counted that they would do 
some thing.  And it's very unjust to confuse these i
ssues.  And I think we have to correct this and 
we have to ma ke this understood.   Wi se has al
ways tried still.  He was not the naive person 
ma ny peopl e want to see in him.  There is a le
tter which he writes to
 Nahum Goldman in -- I 
think it's April 1943, just during the time  of the 
Bermuda conference.  And Goldman is -- for the 
Passover holiday some where in the countryside.  A
nd Wi se keeps him informed in this letter and 
writes to him, "The things are as we foresaw, 
going very bad, and from bad to worse.  Some  
people say we should publicly denounce the President.
  I believe this would be a mi stake.  He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
73 
 
can still try.  If we attack him, too, it will depr iv
e us of our last  support, and it will only give 
great satisfaction to the Congress, which is a re
ally anti-Semitic Congress -- in this country." 
Such letters -- and it should be shown in your 
archives here -- show that he was by far not a 
naive person whom people want him to be, that
 he was by far not blindly following Roosevelt in 
these things.  The relationship between Wi se an
d Roosevelt went up and down in various ways, 
and it's not so simple at all.  But he had grea
t admi ration for Roosevelt.  There is no doubt.  And 
what Roosevelt did and what Roos
evelt did not do I think is one of
 the points which we have to 
discuss also in the followi ng discussions.   This ch
apter, therefore, ends with a terr ible negative 
despair.  Nothing is ha ppening, and we are attend
ing, we are assisting at the killing of millions of 
Jews without any active counter
action.  I did not stop ma king pr
oposals and reporting.  I was 
terribly pessimistic.  But my feeling was, you ha
ve to try, and if you don't succeed, you have to 
try again and you have to try again.  And I ha
d enough energy to keep this through.  My good 
friend Lichtheim was even more pessimi stic than I.
  And he wrote lots of letters, description 
which are today very valuable because they show
 the situation as it was.  I wrote mu ch less 
letters.  I didn't  like to write open letters 
through the ma il which I knew would all fall into 
German hands and through the German censorshi
p.  But I tried -- over again and again to get 
some  ideas through and some  rescue proposals. 
 And there are a numbe
r of very important 
reports, which you will fi nd in the files of the Congr
ess, in January 1943 and later, and one of the 
most important is the report of the telegram of
 April 1943, in which I ma
ke again a number of 
very important rescue proposals. This telegram ha
d also its special fate.  In the meantime, the 
State Departme nt had instructed the embassy in 
Bern not to transmit any more private me ssages 
or me ssages of private organizations
.  It is in reality 
meant against me.  The reason was if we cut 
off the source, then the Jewish organizations 
in Ne w York cannot cry and cannot push us and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
74 
 
cannot threaten us.  It was a very simple way.   
But when -- in April, the consul in Geneva and 
the mi nister in Bern saw that I had very impor
tant proposals to ma ke, 
they didn't understand why 
they shouldn't  communi cate this to 
Washington.  They considered it 
very important.  So finally -- 
they didn't tell me  that they had these instruct
ions.  But they -- they said there were some 
problems.  Finally, they came to a very funny conclusion, whether I was ready to pay for the 
telegram.  So I was puzzled by this proposal.  An
d I said immediately "Yes
."  It was the most 
expensive telegram I ever sent in my life.  It 
was practically a full salary -- although my salary 

wasn't  very high -- but nearly tw
o hundred dollars it was.  You can imagine for what I worked at 
the time .  And I said, "Yes."  In the long run, it 
wa s a very cheap telegram
.  It put into action 
--really, it led to the establishment of the War 
Refugee Board, of all the ac tions which were 
undertaken.  And when you put it in 
relation to this, it was a very, 
very cheap, cheap telegram.   
 In any case, this telegram sugge
sted two great actions.  One was th
e rescue action in Roma nia.  I 
had been informed by the Jewish community le
aders in Romania through the Red Cross that 
there was a change in attitude of Marshall Antonesc
u and the Minister of th
e Interior  with regard 
to the Jews and there may be possibilities of 
emigration fr om the Jews in Transnistria to 
Palestine.     Now, this was sensational news, of course.  And they asked -- but they needed funds 
for this.  And the funds -- and there was a very or
iginal idea, that the funds
 would not have to be 
transferred to Roma nia, but could be put in a 
-- in a blocked account in Switzerland until the end 
of the war.  Now, this was a very attractive a
nd sensational idea.  The 
second was the effort -- 
and this came from the people who were in th
e Jewish underground in France, Belgium, and 

Holland -- a concerted effort to evacuate as 
ma ny youngsters and children from these three 
countries towards Spain or towa
rds Switzerland.  And 
that they needed for this money, they 
needed for this weapons, they needed for this a
ll kinds of ma terial.  They needed machines to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
75 
 
falsify papers, identity papers, ration cards, a
nd so on, and so on.  And this was the second great 
proposal.   When this telegram arrived in New Yo
rk, they went to the Jewi sh authorities.  The 
ma tter was brought to Roosevelt himself and to Morg
enthau, and apparently they agreed with the 
plans.  Although this was really going out of 
the norma l ways.  But April passed, May passed,  
June passed.  In July, Stephen Wi se goes to Mo
rgenthau, and says, "What happens?   Nothing has 
happened.  Where are you?"  Mr. Morgenthau sa
ys, "I don't know.  We  ha ve agreed for a long 
time that this should happen."  And there he char
ges two of his assistants, Bader (Baylor ? )  and 
DuBois, to find out what happened.  And there co
me s the famous report of the two Protestant 
assist ants of Morgenthau after 
having approached some  of the people in the State Departme nt, 
and they find out that the whole -- sa botage whic
h is taking place in the St
ate Department all the 
time, from t he beginning of the suppression of 
my cable, from the instruction not to send any 
cables to me , up to the sabotage of this great
 rescue plan.  And they write a report for 
Morgenthau, which they -- to which they give
.  The report is published.  Everybody can read it 
today.  It's a terrible indictme nt against the Depa
rtme nt and is -- they give it the title, "On the 
Acquiescence of This Governme nt in the Mass Murd
er of the Jews."   Now, Morgenthau agrees, 
but the title is, after all,
 a little bit too strong, and he calls it 
"Report to the President."  But he is 
more clever than to give them -- him the report
.  He asks his legal advisor, Professor Cox, to 
prepare a positive proposal of how to deal with th
ese matters.  And he comes with the idea of a 
refugee -- Wa r Refugee Board comp osed of represen
tatives of the State De
partme nt, the reasury, 
and the Wa r Departme nt, which should be entruste
d with the special task to deal with the 
problems of the victims of Nazi 
persecution and the help which can 
be given to them.   Roosevelt 
sees that the report of the two assistants is dyna
mite and sees that some thing has to be done and 
accepts quite favorably the idea of the Wa r Refugee Board.  But in the me antime, Morgenthau is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
76 
 
clever enough not to antagonize too much the St
ate Department and -- what's  his name ?   
Secretary of State?  
 

Q.   Cordell Hull? 

 

A.   Cordell Hull.  Cordell Hull. 

 

Q.   Okay.  Hull was -- 

 

A.   Yeah, yeah.  And he ma kes some appro
aches, and Cordell Hull gives in, and suddenly 
some thing happens and nobody understands why.   I am called on the day before Christma s,  

23rd or '4th of 1943, to the legation in Bern, a
nd say, "What?   What have you done?   The whole 
policy and the -- on the financial blockade and 
the food blockade, it's all set aside.  What 
happened?   What?"  And I didn't know what happe
ned.  This was Wi se's and Morgenthau's doing 
here.  In any case, full of admi ration, I get handed
 out a document, the first license in which the 

World Jewish Congress is authorized to send to
 me  as the first amount, twe nty-five thousand 
dollars for rescue activity in favor
 of victims of Nazi 
persecution.   And one tells me  that I can 
ma ke proposals to change the text, and so on, and 
that it is only a first 
gesture, and if it works 
well, it can be repeated, and so on, and enlarg
ed, and so on.  But it is really a breakthrough, 
complete breakthrough.  And what we know today is
 that in the last moment, the British embassy 
in Bern tried on the request of the Ministry of Œ 

 

Q.   Economic We lfare? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
77 
 
A.   -- Economi c We lfare to stop this thing.  A
nd it holds up the whole thing for two weeks, I 
believe .  But it is fina lly accepted.  So this was really a Christma s gift.  And then they really 
didn't know what happened and how it got -- my 
shares went up very high in the embassy. 
 

Q.   Hanukkah came on Christma s that year? 

 

A.   It was.  Yeah.  It was on Christma s. 
 And now, the -- the rules 
were very strict and 
unworkable, and I imme diately sa
id that this is not possibl e in this way.  I made certain 
observations.   After a few days, they -- they chan
ged the rules and gave it a better formula and 
less strict, and then without my commenting agai n, a third text came in.  And the third text 

come s in the day which the Wa r Refugee Board is 
created.  You see the di r
ect link of this action 
with the creation of the War Refuge e Board.  A
nd now we worked under this, I have to report, 
and it's very complicated.  But it is a breakthr
ough.  And the establishm
ent of the Wa r Refugee 
Board is really the one great positive decisi on whic
h has been made.  I am not saying it -- I am 

not saying it's -- whatever, the Wa r Refugee Boar
d was wonderful, but at 
least it was a serious 
effort to help.   And from this mo ment on, we got
 support of all the embassi
es all over Europe, in 
Stockholm and in Bern, and in Turkey, in Ankara, 
and in Spain, and in Portugal.  And we really 
felt the governme nt behind us. And some thing whic
h is most important, during the last year, 
from January 1944 to end of May, the end of the 
war, in May, '45, that twenty million dollars 
were channeled through the Wa r Refugee Board -- 
Jewish money, not other money --this we also 
have to talk -- were channeled to -- for efforts to
 rescue Jews, to help Je
ws and other victims of 
Nazi persecution.  It is the one great thing wh
ich has happened.  And I am very happy that this 
came out of my nor ma l activities, an
d it was directly linked to these pl ans, the plans themselves, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189

the Roma nian situation.  It could never be reesta
blished.  Antonescu changed his mi nd.  It wasn't  
possible.  The situation -- the whole plan fell 
through because it was eight months between when 
I suggested it and when it happened.  The other question of the help for the rescue of the children 
and youngsters, and bringing them out to Spain and 
to Switzerland.  It was -- was applied.  This 
is one of the three great parts in the rescue e
fforts in which I took the -- a personal -- a personal 
part.  But this is the -- really 
the story.  It took eighteen months 
from my first reportin August 
until some thing at all was done.  And I tell you, it was 
one of the most terrible time s in my life.  I 
saw one report after another, full of gloom and di
saster, and waiting for the 
world to react, and -- 
and nothing was happening.  It was really the mo me nt
 of our greatest need, and we were terribly 
lonely and abandoned during that 
whole period, and during this pe
riod millions of Jews were 
killed.  

Q.   Now, le t me  go back for a second to the Ro
ma nian situation.  I know that the plan to have 
Jews emigrate from Romania did not work in pa
rt because of German obj ections and Roma nian 
objections.  But I was under the im
pression that that scheme  of 
using mo ney, money deposited in 
Swiss accounts, then was used to persuade people within Roma nia itself to lend money to keep 
Jews in Roma nia itself alive.  Now, I don't know
 that the World Jewish
 Congress was involved 
in that, but Œ 

 

A.   No.  There was something -- I don't know.  I  
wasn't  any more involved there.  But Kolb one 
of the Red Cross people helped in
 this respect.  The details 
I don't know.  But the whole thing 
was this idea, to finance things and 
to be paid at the end of the war. It worked not only there.  It 
worked also in France and other pl
aces.   I know that we paid a lots of mo ney later for what our 
friends in France had taken as loans, and we were 
presented with it, and the Joint, the same .  This 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
79 
 
was a great, great part.  But th
ere was a political change.  Ther
e was a certain mo ment where the 
other -- Antonescu had greater pow
er, I think, and that disappeared
 apparently afterwards.  But 
the details I forgot.  You know, some thing 
which doesn't  work, you don't -- you are not so 
interested any more.  You are interest ed in things
 which work.   But I believe it's -- what I have 
now to say is what the -- thanks to the Wa r 
Refugee Board -- functi
oned and what didn't  
function, and there are a certain num
ber of things in which they ha
ve certainly helped.  There is 
criticism they could have done.  The greatest criticism,
 of course, is that it 
started in January, '44.  
Could have started in '42 instead of in '44.  A
nd this is one thing.  But on the other hand, I must 
say -- I didn't say it until now -- my great hero 
is Morgenthau.  Without him we would never 
have had this.  He really pushe
d it through with Roosevelt.  Ther
e is no doubt.  His assistants 
discovered and disclosed what happened.  This in 
itself is a great service.  And by the way, when 
Morgenthau had his seventieth birthday -- no.  Wh
en Wi se had his seventie
th birthday, orgenthau 
ma de a speech and said he would never forget. 
 And Wi se and Jimmy, his son, came to him and 
showed him the telegram which I di
d.   And then after the war, Wi
se sent me  to Morgenthau.  He 
would like to make your acquain
tance.  And I was with him for an hour and a half.  He 
questioned me  about the people, and so on.  Wh en 
I came in, he looked at me .  He is a very tall 
fellow, you know.  I am not so tall -- and looked at me
 -- the face, a little at an angle, said, "So, 
this is the fellow who changed my life."  This wa
s what he said to me .  Which, of course, moved 
me very mu ch.   But he became  back a Jude -- 
Je w.  And this was very, very far away.  But I 
revere Morgenthau -- not for the Morgenthau plan, 
which didn't  function in any case, but also for  
generally what he did, together 
with the friend and assistant of
 the president -- in the White 
House.

Q.   Cox or -- 
 

A.   No, no. 

 

Q.   Hopkins? 

 

A.   Hopkins. 

 

Q.   Yes.  

 

A.   What 's his first name?   

 

Q.   Harry. 
 
A.   Hmm?   

 

Q.   Harry Hopkins.  

 

A.   Yeah.  They together supported the Lend 
and Lease.  Hopkins.  And Morgenthau supported 

him. Without Lend and Lease, I don't know whethe
r Britain would have come  through the war.  
This is a decisive mo me nt, and it's not an accid
ent, that in the general scene and on the Jewish 
scene, Morgenthau was deeply involved.   Imag
ine for a mo me nt what would have happened if 
Britain would have gone down.  It would not be
 only Britain.  It would not only be 400,000 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
81 
 
Jewish in Britain being under Hitler.  It woul
d be the breakdown in 
Palestine and the Middle 
East.  The 600,000 Jews in Palestine who are toda
y the basis of the Jewish Renaissance and of 
the Jewish state.  Imagine that the British gov
ernment would have gone down and Alexandria 
would be open to Rommel, and they would have 
gone into Israel.  The whole idea of Israel 
would have disappeared.  You cannot even imagine 
it, what this ma y be, be
cause we are living in 
this world. 
 

Q.   We ll, the whole course of the war mi ght ha
ve been different.  It 
mi ght have gone on years 
longer, with millions of more people dying who knows where? 

 

A.   Nobody knows.  But that certainly -- that
 anot her million Jews would have been under 
Hitler.  And the present situation of the Renai
ssance of the Jewish people would be wiped out, 
and no -- nobody can even imagine what this wouldhave been if -- if Britain had been -- had 
gone under.   And this is the part where -- wher
e we owe gratitude to Roosevelt.  He didn't do 
enough.  He didn't do mu ch to help us.  But it is 
certain it pr evented -- this additiona l catastrophe 
and this part of the war, too, which we shoul
dn't forget.   And I, 
personally, with all my  
reservations and -- that the most decent person was 
Mrs. Roosevelt in this whole thing.  She at 
least tried, but she didn't prevai
l upon her husband, either.  I mu
st say that this shouldn't be 
forgotten, either.  And it wouldn't have happene d without Hopkins and Morgenthau, who gave it 
from the beginning -- and this results very clear
ly from the Gilbert book on
 Churchill, the great 
part he played in this.  I theref
ore, I said my hero in this whol
e story is Morgenthau.  And -- my 
personal me mory is very moved by the words with
 which he greeted me  when I me t him at the 
time.  Now, I think we can finish here
.  This is a good mo me nt to finish.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189

Q.   How late do you want us to keep going?   This is a natural break point
.  Can we possibly take 
up the next time  right here?   Do 
you want to stop here for now? 
 

A.   We ll, I think -- what is it?  

 

Q.   It's about 4:20.  

 

A.   And we are already an hour late. 

 

Q.   I'm sorry? 

 

A.   We are alrea
dy an hour late?   
 

Q.   Yes, yes.  They'll put up with it some how
.  I think we should stop here, Holly, and take up 
next time .  

 

A.   We ll, I think -- what we have to -- there are three -- 

 

Q.   We need to talk about still some  things 
like the bombing of Auschw
itz and some of the War 
Refugee Board activities, and then we need to 
go back and talk about your ideas on bureaucracy 
and the Allies, what should have been done, why it wasn't  done at the time.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
83 
 
A.   No.  But we have to do what was done, 
positively.  And why was not done -- why was so 
little done?   
 

Q.   Yes.  

 

A.   This is really I think one s
hould start now, why was so little done.   
 

Q.   Okay. 

 

A.   And the reasons.  And then what was ne
vertheless done?  And then you can ask me  some  
other question.  I think we 
ma de quite a progress now. 
 

 Q.   Yes.  
 
A.   Huh?    

 

Q.   We still -- I think we need to talk more -- 
at  least about the International Red Cross, and -We 
should say some thing about the Re
d Cross, about  the Vatican...

GERHART RIEGNER 
May 11, 1992 
 
A:. .in in...when I was in Budapest. This was st
ill the Budapest under Communist regime . It was 
very difficult to have convers ations. You were, of course, 
followed everywhere and you 
were under supervision everywhere and you ha
d to be very careful what you talked 
about, and more was a delightful (laugher) 
subject which nobody could uh uh object to. 
And so I told one evening this story and 
and uh the dinner where I was invited and the 
ma jor Jewish uh personalities of the vari
ous groups, they th
ey...all through those 
communities, the libera l community, Zionist...th
ey were all there and uh the result was 
that a few months uh weeks later, I got from
 the office of the World Jewish Congress in 
Budapest a letter, saying you 
told us this interesting... 
 

BREAK IN TAPE  

 

...and report what they lived through. And we have
 here about four thousand such uh witnesses 
and there are some  whic h write and speak a
bout uh the and the . Are you interested in 
these .. reports?  Now I personally, of course
, I was interested but uh the uh those who 
really needed it was uh the th
e international auth
ority pursuing the the , so«I looked for 
an opportunity to get in touch with the pe
ople who were involved in  the in the uh 
prosecution of the people and I wrotea letter and there was no uh personal 

communication since Germany was s till completely cut out from the circulation, normal 

circulation, and uh and I learne
d that Kastner was asked to uh to go as a witness to 
Nuremburg and they asked him to take a lette
r to uh to Nuremburg a
nd give it to the uh 
uh competent prosecutor. And he did this, and 
when he came back he told me the stor y 
which was very uh stranger He didn't...this was 
typical of Kastner. He didn't just give the 
letter (laughter) to to the pr
osecutor who was Mr. , the assist
ant...the former assistant of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
85 
 
of uh . He, by the way, has written a full book 
about the uh the prosec
ution about against 
and the and so on, and when he came to...when Kastner came to , whom he didn't of 
course know, he was there in order to give w
itness in the case against Baker (ph) and the 
people with whom he ha d cooperated, and when
 he gave the the letter, the prosecutor 
looked at the signaturea 
found my si gnature, and said some thing like, hum, very reliable. 
Very reliable. Now he was, of course, fasc
inated and flabbergasted... how does this ma n 
know my na me  with all, and (coughing) and as
ked him. Then he told him, you know, this 
i8 a long story. I can't  tell you this now but 
if you have time in the evening, we can go 
have dinner together and I'll tell you the st
ory. And so it .. happened, and it happened that 
he told him t he whole story which you'll find them in Morganthal's  diaries which were 

published in Collier's a few months later. I he
ar d this st ory the fi rst time from Kastner. 

Was a little bit uh doubtful, but when I came 
uh uh a month or two mont hs later to the 
United Stat es, this issue of Collier's appeared, 
while I was there, and for the fi rst time the 

whole story came out and uh I must say I was very impressed by by the . They are very 

fine uh uh civil servants and we owe them much t hat this sabotage will see uh State 

Departme nt, they came out and and was ac
knowledged. There was a clear line in the 
State Departme nt which really didn't want to
 be cooperative. I think the head of it was 
Breckenridge Long (ph), uh one of the higher o
fficials in the State 
Departme nt who was 
put there by Roosevelt because he or his family had given considerable funds to to the 

election...electoral funds of Roosevelt, but 
really the the policy which they pursued I 
don't think really were in the line of of R
ooseveltts liberal attitudes. Uh Breckenridge 
Long really considered his holy duty to keep 
the Jews out of America. I think this can 
without reservation be affirmed.  
 

Q:Uh there are those historians who say th
at uh Peter Berksen and his organization... 
 

BREAK IN TAPE  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
86 
 
 
A:This I have heard ma ny times. I personally be
lieve that this i8 hi
ghly exaggerated. Uh I 
believe one can argue very uh uh with with grea
t justification that my telegram of April 
1943 with all the proposals it contained, uh has le
d directly to the esta
blishment of the of 
the uh uh refugee board. I think when when these proposals we re submitted to 

Morganthal and , and were approved by 
both, and nothing happened, and found out in 
July which means several months later that
 nothing happened and went to Morganthal 

and complained, and that led to the decisive
 action of Morganthal. 
One...in the asking of 

the report asking the two assist
ants the boys they paid to 
find out what really happened, 
and number two, he he he...really on the basis of
 this reportt he was able to go to the 
President and to complain. Thirdly, he was able at the same  time, not only to present this 

fa mous report on the acquiescenceof this governme nt in the ma
ss murder of the Jews, he 
was able to use this opportunity to come
 with a positive suggestion, and this positive 
suggestion he had uh prepared it with his uh 
legal advisor, Professor , and this was the 
idea of the War Refuge e Board. Now uh I believe 
he has a direct line. 
As a ma tter of fact, 
uh even the way in which the ma tters proceeded, uh when I got just be fore Christma s the 

first license, and I talked about this already,and then the revised for m ten days later and 

then another revised form uh ma king business ea
sier. Uh had ma de all kinds of criticism 
of the strictness of the uh . Again, about tw
o weeks or three weeks 
later, and the second 
revised form is really the day when the 
Wa r Refugee Board was established and the 
facility of these licenses ex
tended to everybody. Now here is 
a very clear line to show 
that this was really the outcome of these plans which I had submitted and which 

Morganthal picked up and and used as the ma jo
r uh material in order 
to ask the President 
finally to act. He was uh a great politician. He
 hims elf used s o me  of the uh propaganda of 
Birksen (ph) to put it...to the disposal of his 
_i own policy. But he used
 it. It was not that 
they had really the decisive influence. Th
ere are uh for a long time plans from this 
extremist groups uh that they had decisiveinfluence on things as they developed. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
87 
 
contest this very much. I think that uh they
 ma y have had an influence on public opinion 
at certai n moments to uh raise the consciousness of the the public, which I will not 
contest, but on the real action I don't thi
nk they had any decisive influence.  
 

Q:Uh what were the most important actions
 of the Wa r Refugee Board as you see it?   
 

A: Well, let me say...I mean the War Refugee Boar
d has also been criticized a number of times 
and said that certainly, rightly
t it was too late. It  was much too late. It was...it came into 
force in the beginning of uh 1944. If it would have
 been established a year earlier or two 
years earlier, it would have been probably mu
ch more efficient, but nevertheless, it was 
ma inly the only decisive action which was ta
ken, and the whole situation changed uh all 
over. We  ha d really the support of the Ameri
can embassies and legatlons all over. In in 
Stockholm and in Lisbon .. and in and in Ber
n, and in Ankara and so on. And this never 
happened before. Here is really, and this you 
have to acknowledge even if you're perhaps 
critical on some  of the actions he could ha
ve done more, but it was a decisive effect. 
Number two...during the period durin
g which it wa s active, that means generally '44 to ,' | 
i May '45...this early the end of the war, uh tw
enty million dollars have been uced, Jewish 
money...I come  to this later...twenty million dol
lars have be en used in order to alleviate 

the fate of the persecuted, the Nazi persecute
d victims, Jews and lots of nonJews, uh but 
the great ma jority, of course, Jews, and the the money was Jewish money. Now with this 

money, lots of things have been done but 
it was not only the m
oney. It was also the 
determination to explore all possibilities
 by which Jews uh people...victims could be 
helped and and the uh action of the Nazis 
counter-acted. Uh my opinion, there were a 
number of things which were
 finally uh were obtained. Uh on the one hand, for instance, 

there were a few uh...which has nothing to do 
directly with the Wa r Refuge e Board but it 
has to be me ntioned as some thing which has has happened...uh the exchange uh uh 

agreements. There was a number of of uh pr
isoners of war who especially wounded and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
88 
 
and heavily wounded who were exchanged as
 through the Re d Cross, and there was a 
great number of Palestinian Jews amongst 
them. I Aaw the the train passing through 
Geneva. Uh these were important acti
ons. The second is a certain...I'm not  
exaggerating...a aertain alleviati
on of the situation in the neut
ral aountries. Uh not direct 
guarantees were given, but they 
were encouraged and they were
 told .. well, we will help 
you after the war to distribute the people
 that not...shouldn't be only on on on your 
charge. This could have been much more
 energetically pursued, in my opinion 
(coughing) and it should have been. I believe 
that Switzerland could 
have taken in the 
double or the triple of of pe
ople which they they took in, and w they'r e they'r e not so 
ma ny countries who can say they took as ma
ny a s  Switzerland did, but but...and this was 
the general situation. But this was important. Th
en the what I said referred indirectly of 
any..the end of the uh financial blockade and of
 the food blockade in favor of the victims. 
This is really a great decision, and I quoted 
how I was received in Bern when the first 
license came and they were very astonished 
because the British had blockade and so the 

mi nistry of uh..-I don't reme mber...economic
 wa rfare I think it 
was the name  in 
Britain...uh tried to stop the license
 until the last moment, and in
 fact it was given to me  
several weeks after it was also was to be 
delivered. Now this was really important. Uh 
really there was no no uh lack of mo ney any 
mor e . If you really wanted to do some thing, 
the money was available. Uh I wouldn't sa
y that Sonny Meyer (ph) and others who 
disposed _ , they had some  proble ms there.
 And we certainly had problems, uh coul dn't 
raise the money in Europe at the time, (c
oughing) and the the food blockade. I mean I 
never...I think I said it alr
eady...I never observed a food blockade. I uh 1 disobeyed my 
colleagues and my superiors in America in this
 ma tter. They were not very happy, but ". I 
considered that I was in a neutral country a
nd I could use uh and .\ should use whatever I 
could in helping starving Jews in the occ
upied territories and this would...but a great 
action. I think , it was 
engaged and food passes by the Jo
int through the International Red 
Cross. T think they gave them a million dolla
rs or some thing like it, and this was done 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
89 
 
now under in a in a very...in a much larger 
uh uh proportion as it was 
possible before. : . ! 
8 I myself...the the Congress...the World C
ongress office in Geneva has uh during the 
war sent hundreds of thousands of of parcels,
 uh mostly from Portugal, small parcels but 
uh which certainly have have 
helped thousands and thousands
 of people to survive.  
 
Q:Let me  stop you there for a second. They have 
to fix something in the room. They're shutting 
off the tape. Just a few seconds....  
 

Q:Dr.Riegner, you were telling us about the acti
ons that the War Refuge e Board took or ma de 
possible.  
 

A:Yes. Uh I spoke about the uh the big . Now uh th
e next point I would like to underline is the 
support which was given to the actlvities of 
the underground uh in order to help Jews on 
the spot uh to survive through uh thanks to fals
e papers which were used in great ma sses, 
uh papers of every kind uh especially uh ra
tion cards which had to be renewed every 
month uh could use in the tens of thousands
 and the hundred thousands probably. Identity 

papers, false identity papers, uh baptisma l cer
tificates which were of
 course not , but uh 
showed that the people were not Je ws, uh uh working permits, uh every kind of identity 

and uh identity cards and so on which could be used in very very larte ma sses...uh 

numbers and uh we had in France but particular
ly groups who were charged with this job. 
And it was not only this helped uh tens of thous
ands of people to ma intain themselves, to 

hide and to some how disappear under the 
general population. On the other hand, there 
was a special service establishe d in west
ern Europe by the Jewish uh resistance 
move me nt which tried particularly to orga
nize the immi gration of Jewish youngsters uh 
towards spain and Portugal and then the fr
ee world, or towards Sw
itzerland. And uh these 
groups uh were extremely successful They brought several thousand childr en to 

Switzerland, a number of them with their pa
rents. There were se
veral hundred parents 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
90 
 
also came. Uh there were a considerable number of youngsters accompanied by arme d uh 
uh conduct to the Spanish frontier and uh then 
they came out to the $ree world. Uh this 
is...was one of the most successful activities 
and covered, as I said, thousands of people. 
Uh of course, you would have liked to do much
 more. It was directed
 outside particular 
by my colleague Mark Yahblume ( ph) who wa
s one of the French leaders who wrote 
from nineteen hundred and fortythree and ni
neteen hundred to the end of the war...was 
nearly end of the war in Geneva in my office,
 and we did this together. Uh he got money 
from the Wo rld Jewish Congress, from the Je
wish agency, from the Joint, from the trade 
union move me nt, and uh altogether this was 
by the way one of the finest compilation and 
and rescue of of all kinds thanks to 
a person uh which was accepted in and which 
was...who was active in thi6 and kept the uh c
ontact with the groups in in the occupied 
territories. Uh this is one of the finest 
things I think uh which took place and I'm very 
proud to have been personally involved in th
is and have helped in this. Another very 
important action and this was the political 
. . 10 action to save uh whatever could be 
saved of the Hungarian Jews in 1945. Uh here
 again some thing happened which is very 

strange. We  knew uh and I was responsible to warn before the Hungary was even 

occupied. You can see in the files telegrams 
which I sent and and...several weeks before 
the actual started of the o
ccupation of Hungary, and imme di ately when it was undertaken, 
there's another great telegram where I asked uh what should be done in order to 

counteract it and it should be ma de public c
ounteractions so the me
dias or the radio and 
so on, through t-he free radio from London a
nd the and the...it should be very...an action 
encouraging not to cooperate w
ith the Nazis, encouraging th
e non-Jews to help the Jews, 
to hide them and 80 on. There's a whole progr
am which uh they have suggested to the 

free world and which was uh I believe to a ce
rtain degree used in uh by the the me dia and 
so on. But uh | uh the strange thing which happe
ned in the case of the Hungarian Jews 
was that uh from March to June uh 1944, there 
came  practically no direct news out from 
Hungary, except what we  read in the newspa
pers t in the legal 
gazettes and so on. So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189

what legally happened we knew, but that in th
ese three months, half 
the Jews of Hunga ry 
were sent to to to Auschwitz. It was practic
ally unknown. Uh here th
e Red Cross played a 
very uh un... ..  
 
A:Unhelpful? |  

 

Q:Unhelpful role. They kept some  of the report
s fr om as | we know now fr om Budapest and the 
Jewish organizations and didn't ! 11 deliver 
them to the people who who were uh me a nt 
to receive them. They ar e direct requests 
from the Jewish community to give these 
reports and we receive d them a mont h later 
when uh nothing could be done anymore.  
 

Q: We  need to talk more about the Red Cross and we need to talk more about Hungary, but I 
want to stop you right here and ask you some
thing more about Auschwitz, because its its 
come  up in aontext. Uh there is, of course
, uh an argument from some  of the scholarly 

literat ure that  while the outside worl d knew 
generally what was going on in terms of the 
extermination camps and so forth, that it 
did not know about Auschwitz, Birken...not 
know specifically about the gas chambers a
nd and crematoria at Birkenau, uh even up 
until the mi ddle of 1944. Do you want
 to to comment on that?   
 

A: We ll, that's probably true, that we didn't know. 
Uh we knew that things were happening in all 
kinds of places, but the uh 
concrete knowledge about the 
gas ovens, where they were 
exactlyw uh came much l a ter, and the the report of the two Slovakian Jews was certainly 

a revelation for for all of us. Uh they...there
 was .. also another report from a Polish 
officer which came at the same time. Yeah. 
And we are certainly also seen, uh but the 
the...also the...how the camp was organized, how
 the...where the gas ovens were placed, 
how the...around the the the towers, the watch 
towers, how this was...this was really the 
first time  that we heard the I [ [ I; 12 ¢ real
 inside from this report which came  terribly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
92 
 
late, in June | 1944. Uh and even this is very
 strange why it took so long to to I get out. 
Therews a story that it wa s given to the in | 
and it never arrived or or took several months 
to arri ve in [ in Rome , fo r instance. Now we
 got this this report uh in two ways in 
Geneva. The first uh copy arrived through th
e Slovak underground at the office of the 
Czechoslovakian representative to the Lea
gue of Nations with whom I very closely 
cooperated during the whole war, Dr. . Uh he
 had...I think I have me ntioned it...he wrote 
very closely with one of
 his uh...with one...with one of our colleagues who was 
Czechoslovak, so . Dr. and when the the report
 arrived, he called and asked him to bring 
it to me  and to...he asked me  to ma ke  a condens
ation of the report, wh
ich I did. In four or 
five pages~..this report was...I don't know...forty 
pages or thirty pages, uh and this this 
condensed report I ga ve them not only to him who transmitted it to London, but also to 
the British and to the Americans and the c
onden6ation has been used ma ny...it come s out 
in ma ny...in ma ny ways. I saw, for instance, 
the American ambassador in in London. He 
sent it to all kinds of people. It's exactly 
the same  text in which I ma de. The second copy 
came uh...I .. I I would say a few...a few days or 
a week or ten days later, and arrived and 
came from the uh Budapest Palestine office, uh 
Mr. , and was addressed to the president's 
office in in Geneva. It came  out through a ma
n who died these days, . Uh he had some  

facilities as a secretary of a consulate, a
nd  13 he used uh also Roma nian and other 
couriers to bring these things out. Uh it was a
ddressed to the uh Palestine of f iCQ but in 
reality, and here is a strange 
thing, Montello opened the th
e uh the envelope and gave it 
to uh in Switzerland who was the exchange 
telegraph agency or some thing. Uh the 
agency doesn't  exist anymore...one of the uh uh telegraphic agencies which existed at the 

time. The fa ct that  he gave this to tele
graph agency was, of course, comp letely 

unauthorized and really not in order. On the 
other hand, it was very successful. It uh...for 
the fi rst time, the swiss censor authorities 
didn't stop it, and this was not the me rit of 
(laughter) of Montello but th
e fact that...it showed that th
e war had finally changed and 
the success in the war was on the ot he r side, 
and to our great astonishme nt, the Swiss let 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
93 
 
it go. Uh who has really the me rit for this 
decision, I I don't know. I never found out, but 
it was a very important step which was then 
claimed by Montello as as his great success, 
but let me not touch this claim. Uh important was the fact that  for the fi rst time a detailed 
report on Auschwitz came out, and 
I would say that before this 
report, and this is a great 
merit for these two Slovakian Jews, uh that for the fi rst time this came in the public. Al so 

much too late, of course. Much too late. our
 understanding, of course
, was clear. The the 
terrible things and the people were killed 
and so on, but the details in which...how this 
was...I would say, but of course, this was ma
ny years ago, and ma ybe some  of it I forgot, 
but I would say that this was 
a decisive mo ment to give us inside knowledge of of how 
this thing happened. 14  
 

Q: We ll...I I, of course, will not quarrel with you
r judgment of uh decisi ve moment, but someti me 
you and I will talk about some  of the 
earlier docume nts which came out about 
AuschwitzBirkenau. There are earlie
r reports, not so detailed...  
 

A:No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying that we we  didn't know. Of cour se we knew and we 
knew also that there were uh uh hard labor a
nd and and we were in 
contact, but uh there 
were documents, you could really accep
t as as as...this was really .  
 

Q:Can you give us an approxima te date when yo
u received report, when you had to summarize 
it?  Approximately.  
 

A:No, noF There is...I have established this very 
clearly, because uh there is
 a detailed story in 
the report about the...a Czechoslovaki an group which was in...transferred from 

Theresienstadt to Ausford...Auschwitz in quarant
ine. And this is the first time  that we 

hesrd quarantine. And for six months in qua
rantine and afterwards it was liquidated and 
in the report also was stated that in a few 
lines under this what I just me ntioned, another 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
94 
 
group from Theresienstadt arrived for six mont
hs in quarantine. And when I...and this I 
discovered when I was writing condensed repo
rt, and when I saw this I looked at the 
calendar,  15 and saw that there was five
 days left  for the second six months in 
quarantine. I stopped working...  
 

Q: When was that? f  

 

A:I this was this was *must have b
een the 13th of June, I something.  
 

Q:OK.  

 

A:I believe that received the repo
rt on a Saturday or a Friday 
evening, and we were informed on 
a Monday morning, and then I imme diately work
ed on it and fixed the dates. When I saw 
this, that there were five days and a gr oup 
of Czechoslovaki an young people, mostly of , 

uh were certain to be exterminated in a 
in a few days, I stopped my work on the 
condensation of the report
, called a taxi, jumped in the taxi
f and went to . And in the taxi 
I wrote a story for the BBC. The idea was the BBC should day and night tell the people 

that publicly, the public, 
that we know that such a group wi
ll be gassed within five days. 
Uh and when I came to , this this uh given 
the the draft (laughte
r) which I I wrote on on 
my personal note paper, uh uh is still there.
 We  we found it. And uh imme diately agreed, 
but he really didn't...he didn't send it to L
ondon, to his governme nt. He knew that there 

was a representative of the BBC in Bern, a Mr
s. _ , a very well-known uh l 16 journalist, 
and he addressed it to her, and uh as a ma tter 
of fact all these papers we we have today. 
We have copies and we see it, and , in fact
, sent the the the the report to BBC and it was 
uh transmitted a number of times. When I 
told the story once,
 the one of the 
Czechoslovakian inma tes of uh uh Auschwitz, uh 
he said yes, I heard it. I said how dld 

you hear this story. He said I was in Auschwitz
. I said, you had a radio? He said yes, we  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
95 
 
had a radio. This was the father of the hist
orian Kolka (ph), Arthur Kolka. The the old 
ma n, he has a book, and uh he assured me ...this 
is the astonishing 
thing...he assured me  
that this...on the basis of this report from th
e uh from BBC, they could ma nage to hide 
this this group in other barra
cks. I said...he said I don't...I 
cannot assure you that they 
survived. At that mo me nt, we saved them. Whether they...later Icannot tell you. But it 
showed me  what extraordinary (laughter) me thods you had to uh use in order to save 

them. It was a crazy idea that I jumped in a
nd stopped writing of the report and I sent this 

report to London. But you had to have and th
is is my, perha ps one of my greatest 
criticism uh with regard to Jewish organiza
tion, that they were too much following the 
norma l routine in their work. You had to have
 extraordinary ideas, crazy ideas, ideas...T 
say it openly, in order to because it was an 
extraordinary situation. I give  you another 
example which also uh uh I have some ti me s told. In Jerusalem, the head of the 

Departme nt of the Jewish Agency was 
Greenbaum (ph), a very respected ma n, uh 
particularly respected by us in the World Je
wish Congress because  
E 17 of his past as a 
Deputy in the Polish . He was really the greate
r fighter in the inter-w
ar years for Jewish 
rights in the Polish . Uh very
 courageous. Uh he left Poland, I don't know exactly when, 
and went to Palestine. He  was a Zionist. He
 was was from the radical party, but a great 
fighter for huma n rights, for for civil right
s and so on. Now one day, I get a telegram 
from Greenbaum in whi c h he asked me  to fi
nd his son. I have this compl e tely confused. 
A ma n like Greenbaum asked me  to find in
 Poland, son, and also what's going on. I 
couldn't sleep for several nights. I had great re
spect for the man, and I said well, after all, 
the son, the father, son...he looks...I have 
to do some thing. But it was crazy. How can I 
find a son who's in some  camp, if he i8 sti
ll alive?  Who knows. And I decided to try a 
crazy idea. I sent ten little 
parcels to ten different camps 
with the name  of t he son of 
Greenbaum, and I found him. Here shows...you 
really had to go ways and use me thods 
which were not the normal. So I decided the nine packages will be lost , and somebody 

may get them. But I found it. I'm not...I'm just
 using this opportunity to show that you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
96 
 
had to to use absolutely unusual me thods, a
nd it wa s...now let's go back to the action of 
the of the War Refugee Board and what was. .w
hat was...can be put to
 a certain degree on 
on it's credit.  
 

Q:You're talking about Hungary and how you knew 
very little from March to June 1944, but do 
you want to talk a litt
le bit afterwards, what
 happened...?  . » ! 18 0  
 

A:Now, whe n when this when when this uh 
news came and I said the second copy of the 
Auschwitz report came  to the Zionist...to th
e Palestine office, and there was added 
already the st atistics of the Jews in the pr
ovinces who had been killed, who had been uh 
transported to Auschwitz and who were dea
d. Uh we...from that mo me nt on when this 

was clear, and there was really > a ve ry impor
tant, concerted political action to save what 
could still be saved of the H
ungarian Jews, and uh at this...i
n reality F the only political 
action which was undertaken by th
e Allies in this respect. By
 the others and not only by 
the others . The F f irst step I think wa s 
undertaken by the King of Sweden. The Swedish 
section of the World Jewish Congress, had some th
ing to do with it. He sent an appeal to , 
the head of the Hungarian state. More 
important was the action undertaken by the 
American governme nt, and that is a uni
que action really. They uh...the American 
government addressed a note to a 
country with which it was at war. This is unusual. It's  
really a break of nor ma l me thods, and uh warn
ed them that if they uh...this policy of 
extermination would go on, the consequences 
they would have to bear and there was 
attached a special note, appeal by Roosevelt hi
ms elf, a statement, in this uh request. And 
this was officially transmitted by the Swiss as intermediaries...they they were 

representing American interest
s in in Hungary and it was a 
direct note. This certainly 
made a great impact. The fact that the great
est st ate in the western alliance addressed 
such a very strong . I 19 uh note to the Hunga
rian governme nt ma de a great . There was 
also an action by the Pope. It's the only time 
that the Pope addressed a telegram direct 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
97 
 
telegram to to and of the Jewish . Uh and 
fi nally there's the action in which I was also 
involved uh uh by the President of the Intern
ationa l Committee of the Red Cross, uh in 
which was equally addressed personally to 
to . There is in th
e literature some body has 
written about it said that the note was transm
itted really very late when the action was 
practically over. That is not the full story 
in my opinion because because the the legation, 
the Hungarian legation in in uh Bern was fully
 infor med about this, and they they ma de 
this appeal ma y have reached in di rect ways
 already. All this together had a decisive uh 
uh result and and stopped for a certain time th
e deportations. Then la
ter there was ..for 
months we fought against the attempt to to 
re-introduce the the ol
d policy, and uh this 
is...these  mo nths are really very confu6ed. Th
ere are all the time initiatives to uh continue 

the action to send people to Auschwitz, to c
ontinue to send them to labor and and put 
them into labor battalions and so on, and the 
, but as we know today, particularly the uh 
representative of of the Red Cross in in Buda
pest, two of the finest
 representatives, were 
very active and counter-acted 
these things all the time , 
50 I cannot say it was a full 
success, but I can say there wa
s a real struggle going on, a fight
 which lasted for months, 
and we denounced publicly all the negative uh uh
 features of this fight. In reality, all 
this...and we...very important was in this respec
t or  20 to the acti
on of the World Council 
of Churches which was still in formation, 
but they had a very uh strong group there, _ 
and others, and the initiative uh uh was of
 the Wo rld Council with Mark was the 
president of the International Red Cross, wa
s really done on my request, and I gave him 
all the uh the documentation and the arguments
 and and uh I've...we did the I used them 
too and they were, of course, more successf
ul than we. There status was... a very 
religious person and this is today often called 
the decisive thing which happened there. In 
reality this was a cooperative uh effort by th
em and us and uh very much based on the 
documentation which I gave them. Uh but uh...  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
98 
 
Q:Let me stop you here because I think the tape 
is about to run out. OK. We 've got two mi nutes 
left. Go ahead. .  ".  
 
A: What uh happened finally there there was a very important action on the spot with regard to uh 
protection of Jews which the Red Cross a
nd the Swedish and the Swiss and uh other 
diplomatic representatives undertook, and all to
gether it saved practically the Jews of . 
Those who survived to a great extent owe th
is to this concerted 
action and I uh...this is 
really the only political effort undertaken 
during the whole war in 
which this was tried 
out from all uh sides. Everybody knows today 
Wallenberg and what he
 did. There are the 
same  uh uh activity was undertak
en by of the Swiss repres
entation, and the Red Cross 
gave also protection papers. I reme mber very
 well one day Professor who  21 was Vice 
President, called me  in and asked me  uh...we 
are under terrible pressure we should give 
more protection papers, but the more protecti
on papers we give, the less value they have. 
What's your opinion?  I said gi
ve protection papers, Professo
r , this is not Switzerland. 
This is uh uh uh a land where law and order is
 not reigning yet right here. Give them...a 
Jew a chance to survive. How...how...see how th
e situation is. A ma n is
 in the street, and 
he will be arrested by uh policemen or soldie
rs, and then ei ther he has a piece of pape r, 
protection paper, or he has not
, and if he has not, he has no 
chance. If he has a a...then it 
depends on the ma n with whom he has to deal. 
Either he is in a good mood or he is in a 
bad mood. He slept well with his wife last ni
ght, or not. They squa
bbled or not. It will 
depend on the local situation a
nd and the human relationship. 
Give them a....give them a 
chance, and he gaue them the chance and he ordered that ma ny more uh such papers 

would...protection  
 

Q:They have to put on a new tape.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
99 
 
A:Did you read the story of Montello, that he 
saved a hundred thousand Jews, which is with the 
this uh uh nationality or certifi
cates of uh of . I...between our
selves, I have never seen a 
ma n who ha s uh has been saved through this. I have asked ma ny. I've seen ma ny people 
who were saved by Swi8s papers, by Wallenberg
's papers, by other, but some where...that 
story of a  F 22 hundred thousand Jews we
re saved by Montello. YOu know, there are 
more people have been saved  
 

Q:...then were killed. Yes. Uh this is not for 
the tape but I brought you a couple of things on 
Birkhart if you... TECHNICAL CONVERSATI ON END OF TAPE 1  
 

Q:...because they'r e ready for us. Uh we were talking still about about Hungary and the 
cooperation in Hungary for the firs
t time in a political action. Uh 
cooperation..(inaudible)...  
 

A:...until the end really it went and there were 
ups and downs all the time  and the uh...you have 
probably seen the the record of uh Mr. who 
writes uh the story on the action of the Red 
Cross in in Hungary from day to day, and you s
ee there also that I ha
ve been all the time 
involved. Practically every action which th
e Red Cross undertook was finally suggested 
by me. I didn't  uh cease to to push them and 
to pressure them. Uh it had finally some 

result. Uh of course, there was also...this 
was not the only thing 
which I did. I published, 
for instance, in on Hungary five pamphlet
s, uh booklets with great uh docume ntation 
about what was going on, the taking out of 
Hungarian press and ot
her things. This I 
published and sent around, published   ; 23 
anonymously~ to hundreds of people, press 
people, politicians and others. This wa s all 
known to the Red Cross too and uh I used it > 
for the for the churches. I used it with othe
r people. We  WQ we r
eally uh...the the the 
report of the two Slovakian Jews. I don'
t . know whether it's known...I I had them 
transl ated into French. I  printed a little br
ochure in it and it wa s sent, printed in five S 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
100 
 
thousand copies anonymously because I couldn'
t (laughter) do it officially so it was 
illegally, it was was printed and and and dist
ributed in five thousa
nd copies in all over 
Switzerland. (clearing throat) Uh this this 
was very important. I left out some  of the 
name s in order not to make it...but this ki
nd of things I did too and I wasn't  only a 
diplomat. I was...(laughter) also
 at different times in our 
pressure group if you want, uh 
but but what I want to say is that the th
e uh the the Hungarian ex
ample which was, of 
course, the last year  of the war, and we benefitted fr om the fact that uh generally 
speaking people knew that the war was lost fo
r Germany, but that doesn't  mean that the 

Germans di dn't...that their action wa s not as cr
uel and as determined as all the others. 
They didn't accept that they had lost  lost the 
war. Not at all. I mean what the the action 
which the Germans took, Eichma nn and the others uh in in Hungary, was one of the most 

cruelest and the most determined and the most
 quickest... quickest action of the of of of 
extermination which which happened in the whole thing.  
 

Q:They had the years of experience too. I 24  

 

A:. Now uh...I spoke about this but then connected
 with this and we should perhaps speak about 
this in in this connection is the uh the ac
tion which became also possible thanks to the 
support of the Wa r Refugee Board, 
that is the effort of the 
attempt to obtain certain...the 
liberation of a certain number of Jews by br
ibing some  of the uh responsible people, who 

in the year of 1944, of course, were not so co
cksure as they were before and they had 
their doubts whether the the the 
war would be won and they 
had their doubts what would 
happen to themselves, and they were afraid 
what would happen and there were all kinds 
of uh attemp ts to to save thei
r own life, or at least alleviat
e... alleviate their situation. And 
this you see, I have heard, of course, of 
the various groups which were saved by such 
me thods. There are the negotiations between
 Kastner (ph) and uh Baker, Sonny Meyer 
involved in a certain way. There's the action 
uh of and uh the the uh the Nazis to save 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
101 
 
twelve hundred Jews from from Ther esienstadt
. There is the same kind of attempt made 
by uh of the World Jewish Congress in Sweden through the...through Himnler and 
through the the Dr. Kellsen (ph) who who tr
eated him and fina lly , head of uh the 
Swedish Red Cross. All this uh liberate
d a few thousand Jews. Every Jew who was 
liberated in Sweden was was again...there's no 
doubt about it, but it was,
 of course, a very 
limited action. Now in the Kastner case, there was the great attempt to use this uh for for 

a real big deal of...between the Nazis 
and the and the Allied uh uh...  25  
 

Q:A million Jews... |  

 

A:A million or ten thousand 
yeah what was it?  I  
 

Q: What was your opinion?  Could that
 conceivably have been done?   
 

A:No. This was...I mean for fo
r me n...for some hody who followed 
this from day to day from 
outside very closely, I saw that...how ev
en the the small concessions under the 
license...the license which I 
got from the Americans, it was really sabotaged by the 
British and it was a license for $25r000~ I mean
 a ridi culous amount in reality. OK. They 
said if this is successful, we will give 
you more and so I don't uh taking , but when you 
saw how risky this these things were uh and 
there was a determination not to uh let the 
other side benefit from a nything. Uh this was 
from ehe beginning for me  a dream, that the 
the Allies would concede. This was was out 
of the question. I didn't 
object to their trying 
to negotiate and the whole effort was, in my opi
nion, rightly in in this effort to to drag on, 
to negotiate while Jews were still alive and 
could be talked about. This is, by the way, the 
same  what happened in ma ny ways in the 
ghettos in in in Poland and in in the 
Russian...uh some  of the heads of the were
 very intelligent pe
ople and they they 
understood uh as long as they can put Jews to wo
rk, they are not killed. And they tried to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
102 
 
to  26 prolong these periods, and and and to o
ffered Jews for work in order to spare their 
lives. This was exactly the same . The the war 
is going to its end. They saw this. They felt 
it. It cannot go...it was four years, four and ahalf years, and the uh came back and at once 
the armi es, so every month we can keep people alive was was once again. Thi6 was 

absolutely normal and was very intelligent. It was a clear concept which so me of the 

people in eastern Poland especially had and 
was was right. The same  would be applicable 
to the efforts of of of Kas t ner and Brandt 
who who negotiated, but but there could come  
any decisive result was from my poi
nt of view completely uh uh .  
 

Q: What about on the German side?  I mean, you've
 you've i mplied that the Allies would never 
have agreed to supplying trucks and so fo
rth. Do you think the high 
Nazi officials would 
have been willing to...  
 

A:No.  

 

Q:No?   

 

A:No. My my...I have said what I think of the 
Nazi determination to di
srupt the the one great 
thing which uh on which the regime  was real
ly united. There's no doubt about it. The the 
extermination of the Jews was one of the central
 goals of the of the Nazi regime , and that 
they would uh...individuals could ma ke  27 c
oncession and so this is another question, 
but the decisive, the leadership...no.  
 

Q:You know that there's an argument that that uh
 going back to the winter of 1942-43, starting in 
Slovakia with the with with and Rabbi We iz ma nn (ph)...  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
103 
 
A:Oh yeah. The whole thing is with Weizma
nn . But this is...Weizma nn i n uh his me moirs 
attacks me that I didn't support this. The the re
al reason is that I didn't know about it. This 
was kept from me . I don't know why. I've 
never see the Weizmann proposals until '45 
when I was in New York and saw it in our uh 
in the files in Ne w York. In Geneva it wa s 
never shown and his attacks 
against me is compl etely 
without foundation because I 
couldn't support anything which which didn't 
reach me . What I heard about this, ideas 
seemed to me wonderful and a ma n who...  
 

Q:Yes. And Hitler would bargain over thethe fate of re ma ining Jewry in 1943...  

 

A: We ll, I said some thing when I...when I told yo
u why I believed in the fin...the plan for the 
final solution, why why I believ
ed this was possible, and here is the Ame r ican . The 
German Jew had seen the the 
development of the Nazi move
me nt and and knew that they 
were...that this was their central object like  28 
a part of their face, a 
center part of their 
face, on which they would never gi ve  in, and the and at the sa me  ti me  knowing their 

determination, their ruthlessness, their comp
lete uh contempt for moral concepts and 
accepted what is useful to the German peopl
e as they understood and uh and this gi ves 
the answer. Jews in other countries who ha
ve been...have had a much more difficult life 
and history amongst the citizens of other coun
tries than German Jews probably, uh had 
gone through difficult periods but had always found some way to come  through, with 

terrible losses but some how they arranged 
themselves. This was not possible with the 
Germans, and this only a German Je w who had learned, who followed the the Nazi 

move me nt from the beginning, could 
judge. The others had illusion.  
 

Q:We haven't talked yet in detail about th
e possibility of bombing Auschwitz-Birkenau.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189

A:Well, let me let me perhaps before we come to
 this uh~..well we can ta
ke this now. I wanted 
to to take it in another...in another contex
t but it doesn't matter. Uh this is one of the 
strangest things. For me , really
 I don't understand it~ I person
ally was involved in this~ 
I..very much. When the reports from Slovaki
a came out, of the two Slovakian Jews, and a 
few days later it came the reports from the B
udapest Palestine office 
with theifigures. At 
the sate time  there were alre
ady...I think in both reports att
ached the request to bomb the 
communication lines and I 29 Auschwitz. Andboth were done, was never done, and here 
I am before positive which I've never been able to sort...and I come  and then speak about 

the why so little was done. Maybe there's one 
aspect in which we should come  back on it. 
Uh the most  important uh intervention in 
this in this case came from Weizma nn, Chaim 
Weizma nn, t he first president of Israel, who wa
s at the time the pres
ident of the Zionist 
World Organization, who did not in
terfere in any except in this 
case. In this case he wrote 
a letter to Winston Churchill. How important 
he must have felt about it. Uh he he kept 
completely to his line. He is not there for 
general Jewish uh interventions, affairs and so 
on. He is there to first the Zionist idea and 
so on. But here he ma de an exception. And he 
was successful in this exception. We iman has 
has  put this in a very good article which 
was published in commentary in which I have 
been consulted several times be fore he 
would, and it is absolutely clear that
 here some thing happened which is . 
The...Weizmann's intervention was not th
e only one. Wetll co me back on this, but 
Churchill's impressed by We izma nn's letter 
and writes, let's try it. And Eden who was 
less than perceptive I believe toward our cas
e, uh is impressed by Churchill's signature 
and adds his name , OX...let's try it. And then 
it goes to Sinclair 
(ph), up to to the the 
Minister of Air, who is a lib
eral, not a bad ma n, and from there it goes to the Chief of 
Staff, and fr om there it goes back tothe Foreign... Foreign Office. And nothing is 

happening. And to us, and to me , to Goldma n, 
so the deputy head of
 the extraditionary 
corps, the 30 the deputy of Eisenhower...I I don't reme mber the name ...in America...  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
105 
 
Q:McCoy you mean.  
 

A:Huh?   

 

Q:John McCoy.  

 

A:No. It was not John McCoy. It was a general, a 
general. Uh I forgot the name . He he must...he 
mentioned it a number of times. I went to th
e British and the American Embassy. To the 
American Embassy, I gave them ma ps which 
I found in the in the League of Nations on 
the Upper Sa lasia in the twen
ties, early twenties. I said 
this wa s a popular boat, and 
there's . .. probably no better ma ps on this region than this, and I got 
with the help of the 
librarian of the League of Nations, I got copies
 of all these maps. I said this is the best 
you need, and I gave it to to the . This wasn't
 too easy to get such a thing. And they tell 
me it's not possible and they tell me it's t
oo far and we cannot get back and they uh...it's 

too risky and we know today because not only 
they had the...in the year 1944, the Allies 
had the absolute air domination over the whole 
of Europe. Secondly, it's not true that they 
had no bombers that could fly. At the same  
ti me  when we asked...by the way, this came  
up already earlier in in '43 or '4 that...not 
four, '43...someone...the idea l 31 came out _ , 
but it was...we ma de a concentrated effortin June '44. Uh at the same  time when we 

asked, there were five bombardments  of the 
camp of _ , five kilometers from Auschwi t z. 
So why do they lie? Unbelievable...we cannot 
reach it and then they bomb at the same 
time. We know today that the ai
r uh uh the photographs of the...  
 

Q:Photo reconnaissance?   

 

A:Yeah. There is in in London an office which 
has all these photos, detailed photos from the 
whole region, much better, of
 course, than what I could produce from the League of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
106 
 
Nations. But why did...but they lied to us. They
 said some  people...I called _ . He was 
then the the General Secretary of the Congre
ss in New York, and he had an idea not to 
bomb it but to send in commandos
 there and to makes an explosion from i nside in order 
to reduce the number of 
victims, and then some  historians said that was against bombing. 
(laughter) It was a more refi
ned way of of reaching the same
 thing. But here this really 
leaves me  without answer. And it particul
arly it shows the en
ormous role which 
bureaucracy has played. We have always disc
ussed the Holocaust connection with Nazi 
bureaucracy. Uh we 've seen how important th
e Nazi bureaucracy was 
in this, but here 
you see it suddenly that there's another burea
ucracy which has played a very important 
role, a negative role, if men like like like 
like uh Churchill and Eden can give such 
instructions and nothing happened...because the l 
32 bureaucracy doesn't  like it. This is a 
very serious uh aspect of 
the whole thing, and uh...  
 

Q: Wa s bureaucracy then one of the basic reasons 
why the Allies did so little in response to 
opportunities between...  
 

A:Let's let's do this in a more systematic way. But 
thi6 is one of the factors which have certainly 
played a role. No doubt about it. Now we have
 said uh we have ma de a survey of what 

became possible thanks to the support of the 
Wa r Refugee Board, but we have left out 
one, in my opinion, very important aspect, 
and that is the preservation of the camp 
inmates at the end of the war. I must te
ll you that fr om I would say probably October 
nineteen hundred forty-four on, I was...I ha
d an obsession, a real obsession. I was dread 
the fearing that at the end...it 
was clear that the wa r was over.
 It was clear it dragged on, 
the war dragged on but the the Germans had lost
 it, but the Ge rmans who used children in 
the war effort and this wa s and I personally...m
aybe it's my education...I was afraid that 
the last effort in a kind of in Wa ggone r's c
ontext it's ...uh when everything is lost, they 
would at least see to it that the the rest  of 
the Jews who were still alive, they would take  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
107 
 
them with them. And I was absolutely obsessed 
by the idea that in the last moments they 
will make a slaughter of the three or four
 hundred thousand Je ws in the camps which 
were . And I couldn't sleep and 
I told myself, what can we do
 in order to stop this And I 
had at a .1 l 33 certain moment th
e idea, alright let's ma ke a great effort, a joint effort of 
everybody together, because everybody is in the 
same  boat. The French had their inma tes 
in the camps , and the Czechs and the Poles and so on and so on, and I took the initiative 
to mobilize all the Allied forces in Geneva 
in or der to or ganize a joint action to prevent 
this~ It wasn't  too easy. I was stateless 
too, without governme nt. There was no Israeli 
governme nt. There was no Jewish governme nt
. There was no supported, and I took the 
initiative and I...the first 
question is who is neutral e
nough or in good relations with 
everybody that he coul d uh play this role, and I decided on the Czechoslovakian 

government, and I approached the delegate 
from Czechoslovakia at the League of 
Nations, and invite everybody, the French 
and the Belgians and the Dutch and the 
Yugoslav, and the Italian was in the meanti
me ...and the Romanians were also and the 
Greek, and he did. And we had our first meeti
ng I think was in Nove mber '44. I was in uh 
in 8ern that day and came a litt
le late to the to the meeting, 
and I was very pleased to see 
all the representatives either of real governme
nt representatives or 
the representatives of 
the Red Cross Society offices, countries...they 
were all officials practically. It was the 
same . And uh and when I arrivedt he said the idea come s from Dr. Riegner. Let him 

explain to you what what he wa
nts. And I uh explained to them 
that we we were all in the 
same  boat and there was a great danger that 
this would happen, that 
at the last  mo me nts 
they would really suppress all 
the people in the camps and they were capable of doing it, 
and  34 we should do a last desperate effort 
to save this and to prevent this. And we 
discussed various ways, uh neutral countries
 or Red Cross and so on, and the idea...and 
there was very considerable support, but of c
ourse they couldn't  decide. They had to ask 
their governme nt, and uh we had several session
s. The last session was 
in in...the decisive 

session was in I think February. It went alr
eady in the next year because the governme nts 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
108 
 
are very slow in replying, and there we a
ll agreed we should ask the International Red 
Cross for a very special, high-level mi ssion to 
the political  authorities
 of of of Ger many 
to prevent it. And it was agreed and then thes
e governme nts, they didn't have all relations 
between themselves and some  didn 't  recognize 
them, but they were all in agreement it 
should be done, and the idea was therefore 
not to to sign a join
t paper but to...that 
everybody should submit this identical appeal 
to the President of the Red Cross uh for 
this purpose. And I wrote the text, and uh 
everybody signed it, and at a certain day 
between ten and eleven, they 
all submitted the the signed a
ppeal to the Red Cross, and 
this led to the last  great action of in Ge
rmany whe r e he saw Carlton Brunner who was 
really the number two under under Himnler. 
Now when called together all these people 
and then when he came back, he called them again together, and I questioned him very, 

very thoroughly and this is also...I didn't just 
take his (laughter) assurances for granted. It 

opened up a certain number of activities fo
r the Red Cross but I think much more 
important, it gave to the German governm
ent as a clear understa
nding that the whole 
Allied, all the  35 Allied governments together 
were determined not to let this happen. 

And it has...while events precipitated and military and others developed so quickly that 

all the _ were uh by-passed by new events all th
e time, so that uh the agreements, the real 
agreements which were concluded be tween and the the German Nazis, the mo ment they 

were done really already by-passed and the a
nd it's not so important whether they were 
imple mented or not. The the...it it created a 
decisive fact, political
 fact, that the the 
governme nts did not allow this to happen, 
and with few exceptions, it didn't happen. 

There are a few camps where they tried to kill 
people, and they killed
 some  of the m, but 
relatively limited. The action was, on the ot
her hand, supported by the activities of who 

acted in the same line with the on behalf of 
the Swedish _ and I was 
in contact, telephone 
and otherwise, with _ in in in Sweden and we
 tried at least to to coordinate and inform 

each other what was going on. I believe that 
strangely the uh people have dealt with the 
Holocaust and the...and so the people who 
got saved and were spared, nobody really 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
109 
 
me ntions this. I think it's one...I think this
 is...the War Refuge e 
Board was supporting us 
very much on this. No doubt about it. The 
American governme nt asked us to keep them 
informed and at later meetings, they were pr
esent. At the first meetings they were, I 
believe, not there. In the late
r me etings, the British governme nt
 also was present. I mean, 
this was really...France and...was was a united fr
ont of the whole uh coalition of the Nazi 
question. And uh I can only say the the the result 
was that the life of most of the people   
36 0 was respected, which I consider was not 
a matter which was going without . It was, 
by the way, not the only activity which th
is group undertook. We  alao addressed 
ourselves in the last days of the war to th
e Allies, and that they should allow uh columns 
of trucks with food and other me dical and so to
 go into the camps and to see. They should 
be not kept out because of military or  bur
eaucratic reasons. And we had...the the same  
group intervened with the Allied governmen
ts on on on these ma tters and probably the 
results were quite positive, 
the reaction on this. Now I belie
ve uh that uh Wi nston's ma n 
like We inman says that the Wa r Refugee Bo
ard saved two hundred
 thousand people or 
some thing such a figure, I I believe this is 
very questiona ble. All these figures are very 
questionable. Uh what _ ma kes the real uh ca
lculations. I believe that the saving of the 
people, the inmates of the camps in the last  mo ment is is is one of the mo st things which 

we reached, saying this was also a collectiv
e effort but I I don't think I exaggerate 
because I was involve d in this. I be lieve really this is...made quite a di fference. Now let 

me  say something about why so little was 
done and why...what sha
ll I say...why so little 
was done and why we have this...  
 

Q:...between Nove mber '42 
and January of '44.  
 

A:Yeah. We ll, we didn't save...the
 the Wa r Refugee Board took ei
ghteen months until the first 
and the only real action was undertaken and 
how ma ny millions of people were uh were 

killed in . I 37 the meantime. Now I, of 
course, have given more thought than most 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
110 
 
people uh because I was so deeply involved and 
I tried so hard and why did all this not 
lead to greater action. There is
 a whole series of factors. 
And I'll may mention them, but 
I'll come to the end to the most i mportan
t uh reasons. Firstly, nobody was really prepared 
for such a thing. And this shows really the 
uniqueness of the Holocaust. That's for sure. 
This had never happened in history, that 
a whole people including the babies and old 
people and and invalids and me n and wo
me n, children, that a whole people was 
condemned to be executed. It hasn't  happene
d. And with all the catastrophes which have 
come  over Jews during the course of histor
y ...in the course of history, nobody really 
mentions such a thing. I mean they'r e  just not 
prepared for this. This is the first time . The 
second is uh the atrocity...atrocity stories of the 1st World 
Wa r...(break in tape) ...this 
came up all the time. During the 1st World Wa
r especially during the occupation by the 
Germans of Belgium, there came all kinds of 
stories what the Germans di d and after the 
war it occurred that this was highly exaggera
ted and a good number of these stories were 
not true. Wh enever I came  as my re ports a
nd so on, I was going against this war. they 

called at that time, and this was a very great 
handicap for . I am not trying to underrating 
it. Number three, the secrecy. In spite of
 everything, this was a so- called secret 
undertaking. Uh has rightly sa
id thatma ny many people were 
involved but officially this 
was a secret uh operation, and not only was it a 
secret operation, this
 was an  38 operation 
for which a special language was invented wh
ich said complete different things which 
they meant. Where the uh ...all this meant m
eant uh a lot of other words and we are...was 
invented in order to ma ke it clear that 
it shouldn't have been clear. The the most 
interesting in this is the the famous speech 
by Himnler to the...in '43 to the heads of the 
SS or...where he said more or less he w
ill never admit it and he action was a great 
national act of self-defense, but in which he sa
id we will not leave any traces of it. I will 
never admit it.  
 

Q:And yet it was being recorded as he was speaking?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
111 
 
 
A:Yeah. Now I have another letter such in my fi
les by Himn ler to Miller w
ho was also one of the 
top people in the in the Third Reich security 
. Section 4. And this is interesting. .. Uh it's 
a very strange...a letter in which he refers
 to a report by Stephen Wi se. You know this 
perhaps...  
 

Q:Yeah.  

 

A:...of September nineteen hundred forty-two, in wh
ich Stephen Wi se mu st have referred about 
my fa mous t e legram and the report. We have
 never found really to what statement of 
Wi se it refers. This is some thing for the 
for the scholars to to work on. And there's 
exactly...and he he he uh he speaks there as
 if uh of course th
e the the course of 
transporting so ma ny people, of 39 course, 
ma ny people die and so on. This is normal. 

And again, don't leave any trace al
so of the dead. It's  clear and absolute deliberate effort 
to to hide  the real facts and to eradicat
e any any traces which could be...it's a strange 
concept. If they are so proud, why...of 
their action, why why 
this secrecy.  
 

Q:I wrote in my book on Hi mmler that Himmler wa
s torn by this conflict between the need to 
conceal, on the one hand, and the need to keep orderly records on the other.  
 

A:Yeah. Now then the next point 
is we have already talked about
 it a little bit but I think we 
should uh talk more about it...the anti-S
emitism is the Allied camp. Now this is 
something uh perhaps at  this mo ment where anti-Semitism is growing agai n in many 

places in the world and even in this country, 
but the generation the last thirty years, the 
American Jewish youngsters di dn't suffer from ant i -Semitism, and they don't...didn't 

understand that there was a very active anti-Sem
itic move me nt in this country in the '30's. 
Uh those who were feeling this moveme nt were of course the Nazis 
to a great extent , but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
112 
 
you had also your your own people. The Nazis w
ith the and their own organization of the 
which were were appointed in 
all the countries to uh develop 
anti- or Nazi activities and 
anti-Jewish activities 
all over. Uh but you had your own 
people. Uh there were the the 
Father Coffma nn who who was twice a week
 I think on the on the on the radio. The 
televi sion didn't exist at the time. There wa
s K.  40 D. Smith, another such uh public 
anti-Semite who who influenced it. It was 
a...and there was the German propagandist was 
extremely ably led and they the German 
propaganda accused Jews of America...they 
pushed Roosevelt into the war. This was...uh firs
t of all, it wa sn't  true, but uh the Jews...it 
it prevented really Jewish activ
ities for two years in the war. You don't find any traces of 
anti-Jewish uh persecutions in 
the in the newspapers from
 ni neteen hundred forty until 
nineteen hundred forty-two. Uh the going 
to war was not popular in this country. 
Generally speaking uh this was one of the greatest problems for Roosevelt. He he wanted 

to to stop the the Nazi Ge rmany. The r e's no 
doubt about it. His whol
e policy was...but he 
couldn't do it because he...the feeling th
at America shouldn't be involved and the 
isolationism of America was was enormously
 strong. And to to to accuse the the the 
Jews...they pushing into the war, they are 
the the the war mo ngers. They are the the 
responsible for...it it...this was a terrible (ina
udible)... and in fact it
 had its effect on the 
Jewish community. It restricted them. They we
re much...they were really afraid of this uh 
accusation and and and and theref
ore terribly restricted a
nd restrained. So...and it was 
highly efficient uh action...way of of uh... _ uh uh extremely uh successful  propaganda in 

favor of the Germans and the Nazis. Now uh...bu
t we had it even in the governme nt. We 
spoke about it. In fact the w
hole story of how my telegram
 at fi rst was received, how 
instructions were given not to
 accept any more messages from
 private persons or private 
organizations. The the uh sabotage of I « 41 [the the rescue effort, the rescue uh plans 

after the April '43 telegr am, uh these all...th
e whole question of visas. I know that our 
greatest pr oblem as German Jews was the American visas, and there was a limited 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
113 
 
number. I think twenty-four 
thousand or some thing for Ger man...people of Ger man...and 
we found out at the end of the war 
they were never filled. Wh y?   
 
Q:You see this as more the result of anti-Semitism than the re sult of burea ucracy or  a 
combination of the two?   
 

A:I think both. But here I think the
...I think the ma n who is
 responsible to a great extent is is as I 
said Breckenridge , and he uh in my opinion, 
pursued the policy to keep Jews out of 
America.  
 

Q:And there were a whole bunch of State Departme nt people who...  

 

A:There were others too. Ther
e were others too. There were
 others too, and uh I don't know 
whether Roosevelt was aware of it or not. In
 any case the lady who come s out very we ll 
is Mrs. Roosevelt who tried very hard but 
didn't succeed either. She she came in several 

times with scheme s for J e wish children and 
so on that...but when 
you turn to...from fr om 
America to Britain, you have the same . There it 
has an anti-zionist fl
avor, that the whole 
time uh uh is valid both for the Foreign Offi
ce and the  42 Colonial Office, and you have 
a very good study by about this and it's page
s and pages where you where you see what 
the bureaucracy did in order not to be 
helpful. There's uh...someti mes ...we haven't 
spoken about these little boats
 which were sent to Palest
ine from Bulgaria and and 
Roma nia with a few hundred Jews, and when 
you read the reports of the Foreign and 

Colonial Office people, you ask yourself, now 
who is the enemy. Is it the Jews or the 
Germans?  And you definitely feel
 that it is the Jews. It's  
unbelievable I me an even when 
you read it today, but it takes takes the es
tablishment of the War Refugee Board, the 
reports and the and the Br itish Foreign Of
fice uh...they don't say anyt
hing else that the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
114 
 
the establishment of the War Refugee Board 
is uh uh a me thod by Roosevelt to gain the 
Jewish votes in the election.  
 
Q:And they were .  

 

A:....that there could be a humanitarian idea behind it 
that you wanted to to
 help people who are 
gravely in danger. Nothing. I mean it's unbelie
vable when when you read it, and these are 
the people who who were on your on your side
. They ran it. He was...there's  no doubt 
that this pl ayed a great role in your , 
the bureaucracy and the anti-Semitism, the 
anti-Semitic bureaucracy was able to prevent.
 Now uh...but in in in...connected with this 
there is a...the insens
itivity of high...of pe
ople in high position, and I am particularly 
me ntioning the military. What what we have sa
id about the effort to bomb Auschwi t z, not 

to bomb 7.,~ [ 43 / AuschwitZ how this is possibl
e. I said why did one 
write it. To all our 
uh arguments and how often did I argue, they...we always got uh they have to win the 

war. I said ye s, but you will...you want to win 
the war in order to save the people who are 
threatened. Yeah, this is uh...we cannot ma ke a
ny any exceptions. Now they tell me  in in 

in in Auschwitz when they bombed the , they 
couldn't have two or three uh bombs left for 
the for the gas uh chambers. Wasn't  so easy for 
us to take the decisi
on, but the...all fact 
responsible are this bombing would kill anot
her number of Jews. Of course. But you 
would have stopped the extermination proce
ss. Every day six thousand people killed. So 
of course we had to say better to stop the th
e the the extermination pr ocess and even if it 
costs some  lives, but where is this ....how is
 it possible that all the high military people, 
that nobody even ma de some  kind of an effort to
 understand this and to help. It didn't cost 

and didn't divert anything from the war effo
rt. Is there some thing wrong in our moral...  
 

Q:So is that a sort of bureaucracy 
as well, or is it antiSemitism or...  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
115 
 
A:No. I think...I don't think it is...no, I don't think 
it was anti-Semitism. It was insensitivity, and 
and concrete...you are a soldier. You have to 
do your job and so on. But as I told you, you 
can also have feelings. And if it doesn't  har m your job, why why why can~t you do 
some thing. Explain to me  that uh we know I 44 
today that big boats came  with soldiers 
over the ocean, with tens of thousands of soldiers, and they went back empty, and when 

we were asking for visas and for transport, th
ey said there's no transport. They couldn't  
fill these boats. Why did they lie?  come back to this. Why did they lie?  There's no 

place...there were enormous space. This was empty. . But here is some thing wrong and 

insensitivity. I don't thin
k they they ever thought of it, and this is the wrong thing. The 
soldiers and and the high officials in gove
rnme nt, also , and there some thing was wrong. 
Question We'll stop here for a mi nute because th
e tape is just about to run out, and then 
we'll continue. TECHNICAL CONVE
RSATION END OF T APE 2  
 

A:All what I have said is...has influenced the s
ituation. But I believe th
ere are two points which 
are really decisive. The first is the complete
 powerlessness of the Jewish people at that 
time of history. It's very difficult for the ge
neration of today to understand it. we have 

today a rather infl uential Jewish community in
 the United St ates. We  ha ve today a Jewish 
state which is uh has been very successful in the last forty year s with militarily, 

politically, which has had great influence 
on ma ny understand this, and not to compare 
the situation of today with the situation forty 
or fifty years ago. That 
has to be learned and 
that's one of the most important problems 
in Jewish education you have to understand. 
Today we are a different Jewish people. We  
have learned from the Holocaust. We  have 

learned from our isolationism
. We  have learned that we 
can and decisive mome nts only 
count on . You cannot apply the ways or or 
position of organizing uh protests of 1990 and 
1940. The great number of these me thods were 
not available. There were certainly not 
available during the war. The 
police would have chased the 
pr otesters away from the 
White House or wherever uh in a in a mi nut
e, and the real thing is that we had no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
116 
 
influence at the time . This is . And the sec
ond uh third truth is that
 what happened was so 
terrible and so beyond any huma
n understanding that people 
really couldn't believe it. 
And I'm saying this meaning both Jews and non-Jews. And concurs in one of his books in 
a very able way exempl ified this point. To
 exterminate a whole people including babies 

and sick people and...is some thing, and and and 
to throw babies into gas ovens, burning 
the human beings alive and then...is some thing which we...goes beyond any huma n 

understanding and . And therefore, we have 
to distinguish between knowing the facts and 
accepting facts. After the declaration of th
e Allied governments in December of '42, 
everybody knew. And we thought now some thing will happen, decisi vely will happen. 

But in reality, the people who had under...had 
signed this declaration had great doubts 
whether this was really happening. And Jews 
themselves...I would ! : 47 say that ma ny 
people who knew, who learned, who spoke about 
it, had in their inner hearts somewhere 
a reflection...I hope this is a
ll not true. You cannot...this canno
t be true. I give you a few  
examples. In nineteen hundred forty-three, 
I got one day from the Union of Polish 3ews 
in America, a package with thirty thousand 
addresses in Poland to whom I was supposed 
to send packages. When I received this packag
e, I got nearly crazy. This organization had 
its seat in the same  building and I believe ev
en on the same  floor as the American and 
World Jewish Congress to whom to whom all 
my reports went. They mu st have read all 
my reports. I asked myself, they have still no
t understood it. But it wasn't  this. They had 
read it and they had understood it, but they couldn't accept that their own fa milies were 

included in the . It cannot be. None of th
ese thirty thousand addresses were valid 
anymore. They people had been evacuated or ha
d been killed already 
or had been in the 
in the camps . Not one was . But you couldn't sit 0 and do nothing. You have to do 

some thing. And you're excluded you own fa m
ily. Alright. I know that many ma ny pe ople 
are sacrificed and killed, but 
not my fa mily. This cannot be true. And so they collected 

that some thing has to be done, so they collect
ed the addresses, and . They never got . I 
couldn't do anything but here you have th
e schizophrenic reaction. Knowing, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
117 
 
not...somehow not believing or taking excep
tions for yourself. The story of is well 
known. It has been often repeated. When when
 when he went to Frankfurt and and and 
and and uh I can't  believe it, and then he sai
d, you mean I am a ,  48 liar. He said no, I 
didn't say that you are a liar. Bu
t I said I can't  believe it. But this is one of the most 
respected Jews in this country. When wise 
got my first uh report, he sits down and the 
next day or two days later and 
writes to Frankfurt and tells h
im and and really shares with 
him his terribly despair. What can one do, but 
tell the the . He Fra
nkfurt he probably did. 
I'm sure he did. Uh there's another stor
y of uh which was given by Professor deYoung, 
who is one of the authors of the classic wo
rk on the uh deportations from Holland, and he 

was a young ma n and and and the governme nt of
 exile in Holland during World war II, 
and was in charge of radio emissions, and he gets hold of some of my reports, and he 

reports in a lecture he gave in Wa shi
ngton...no, in Harvard, some  time ago, and uh tells 

the story how he gave these reports to th
e Prime Minister of Holland, . tells...uh returns 
these reports a few days later to him and says
, you believe in this stuff?  But worse even, 
who I ma de me ntioned before who was Secret
ary General of the World Jewish congress 
during that last period of the Wa r, uh there 
was in 1944 in November
 a great conference 
called by the World Jewish Congress in Atlan
tic City which really sets out a post-Wa r 
program of t he Jewish people. It's a very 
important document. Uh it's really...it was the 

next twenty years what Jewi
sh...the Jewish community in in the world has pursued as 
goals and so on is defined there. Astoni
shing how how good the document is, a very 

important contribution to Jewi
sh planning and Jewish policie
s in the post-Wa r. And goes 
to a number of mi nisters . .'  49 with the dele
gation of the assembly in Atlantic City and 
he meets a mongst other people uh the uh Vice 
Minister of the Defense, McLoy. You 
me ntioned him before, a nd they submit the offic i al documents and tell him to speak about 

it and so on, and McLoy, a very respected man in the governme nt of this country and 

who played a very important role after th
e Wa r as a high commissioner in Germany a nd 

so on, a lot of other importan
t functions, asked _ to rema in behind when the uh delegation 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
118 
 
retired. And he says and there's a report
 by and it's been published...I don't reme mber 
where but I've read it and he said...so McLoy 
says to him, while now as we are alone you 
can admit this is all pr opaganda. This is 
December nineteen hundred forty- four, five 
months before the Wa r was over and the numbe r two ma n in the governme nt on on the 

war effort doesn't  believe it. Now this shows uh there was really the people didn't believe. 

This shows that it was so beyond any huma n 
(inaudible tape) human conditions, that you 
couldn't believe it. this wa s of course one of
 the most negative things and it cost us 
millions of lives. Now I'm not taking away the terribl e consequences, that  on the ot her 

end it's uh perhaps the most hopeful thing in th
e whole history of the of the Holocaust... ..  
 

Q:In retrospect..  

 

A:In retrospect. It means that ma n cannot live with absolute evil. You cannot accept absolute 
evil. There is some  way  E 50 the convicti
on that ma n is good, ma n is pure. Man is not 
condemned to the worst, a
nd this...it's a paradox. When...ma ny Jews do not like when I 
say this, because they cannot forget...I cannot 
forget either this , but the fact that ma n 
cannot accept this, and ma n could not accept it
, gives you hope in the ma n of tomorrow. 
It is really the most positive conclusion 
you can have. In this world of darkness, you 
cannot despair of me n.  
 

Q:Let me  ask you some t hing about some thing that wa
s not specifically on your list of things that 
uh or explanation pr ovide d for so little done
. Uh you me ntione d the insensitivity of high 

officials, but you didn't talk specifically 
about President Roosevelt. You probably know 
that uh some  of the books on the subject, pa
rticularly David Wei man's book uh Single 
Out Roosevelt is is a ma jor factor , perhaps the 
major factor . Tell us a 
little bit about your 
assessment of Roosevelt.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
119 
 
A: We ll, it's of course very difficult for my gene
ration to to make a final judgment on this. We 
work...we uh uh were educated in uh in a wo
rld and this was where it was the only hope, 
and later judge. Uh and of course the st
udy of uh the war record of the American 
governme nt shows that uh all kinds of opportuni
ties were lost and were not used, and the 
political responsibility is certainly borne by 
Roosevelt to a great extent. But on the other 
hand, he is the only one who can
 say...uh could say that this po
licy has also prevailed, to 
preserve some  Jews. I s poke of lend I ; 51 
lease. Lend-lease has 
saved probably Britain 
and probably more than Britain. 
I think that this _ thanks 
to lend and lease and the...of 
course the resistance of the Brit
ish people that they survived, 
and with this survival, four 
hundred thousand Jews in Britain have been sa
ved from the invasion of of the Nazis and 
would have been victims. But another conser
vation is even more important. If Britain 
would have gone under, Palestine would have go
ne under. It was very near that the Na zis 
came into Egypt and Palestine. There are si
x hundred thousand Jews and much more. Can 
you imagine that the Nazis would have wiped out
 the Jews in Egypt 
and in Palestine in 
1942 or '3 or '4. Our whole world...our whole 
Jewish world wouldn't exist. With the 
center of Israel toda y is a power
ful factor for every aspect of Jewish life. That's also due 
to the Allied effort and Roosevelt had an importa
nt stake in it. That doesn't  mean that I'm 
not...I'm defending and the inactivity. I think 
he bears a great res
ponsibility but he and 
Churchill are the only ones who on the othe
r hand have also contributed to the 
preservation of the free world, and that 
cannot be completely forgotten either .  
 

Q:A couple of times we 've me ntioned in passi
ng the role of the uh the Vatican and the 
International Red Cross. Uh it seems to be in
 this section about w
hy was so little done, uh 
we need to come  back to them and talk a bi
t more about . Perhaps what they did, but also 
what they could have done and did not do. l 52  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
120 
 
Q: We ll, on the vatican I have once given a 
great lectur e on the vatican and on the Wo rld 
Council of Churches. Uh they have...there has 
been very little done. Uh I spoke, I believe, 
of the me morandum whi c h we gave to the in Bern in nineteen hundred forty-two, and the 
only result of this was uh that some  action wa
s taken with regard 
to Slovakia and the 
deportations of Slovakia were in
terrupted, stopped for a certain time. This was a Catholic 
priest who was at the head of the governme nt
. Uh in all the...I have spoken on the action 
taken in in Hungary by the Vatican and here I 
believe that the vatican and the the Nuncio 
who was in Budapest has tried to and cooperate
d with the general effort to preserve the 
Jewish community, and even the local bishops
 and uh were influenced in this way. But 
generally speaking, the 
situation depended on this the pers
onal courage and the personal 
determination of the leaders in
 the various countries. And 
you have examples of courage 
and determi nation and you have examples of
 complete uh laissez- faire. Some of the 
bishops and archbishops...you have beautiful
 examples in France like Cardinal of 
Toulousse, who went to the station where 
the deportations from where the deportations 
took place, and his presence was an act 
of protest. There were some  other 
bishops...Bishop , Bishop .. , but there were 
also other cardinal
s who supported the 
vichary regime  fully, and the Vatican neverinterfered even in the French anti-Jewish 

legislation when it was aske
d whether..of his opinion. the 
Vatican in my opinion, and 
there there are twelve or thir
teen volume s of vatican documen
ts what uh what they were 
doing l 53 during the War, I believe
 that the real problem in th
e catastrophe of the...which 
happened to us was never taken seriously by 
the Vatican until the War was practically 

over, and I believe that there was no real re
alization in the highest uh levels of the 
Vatican bureaucracy, uh no realevaluation of the out...of of th
e the the dime nsions of the 

catastrophe, and I believe that 
the Vatican was better inform
e d ma ybe than we believe. 
There are hundreds and hundreds of priests.and we  were not prevented from and there 

are books who report on this, on these reports. In
 the official docume ntation, it shows that 
some  uh priests reported very clearly about th
e about the elimination of the Jews and the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
121 
 
killing of Jews. When prohibited Wi se to 
publish my fa mous it was agreed that they 
should ask opinion of the Vatican and the 
opinion of the Vatican was very wishywashy. 
They said we have also reports but uh it 
doesn't ...on on that treatme nt, but they didn't 
confirm the elimination. Astonishingly, because 
, the who reports regularly to the Vatican 
and who writes about the same time the new thin
gs are the bombardments of the state, of 
the cities, and the uh increased elimination a
nd extermination of th
e Jews and there are 
already mor e than two million exterminati
ons. So one cannot tell me  they didn't know. 
Uh in some  places, the local bishops helpe
d. The action of the vatican centrally was 
practically limited to Hungary. There they 
tried a certain influence, but otherwise I 
wouLd say there was no real great concer
n. And uh I often uh thought that my long 
conversation with uh with Monseigneur Mont
ini  54 in 1945 when the war was over and I 
was asked to plead with him the Catholic aut
horities should help us to recuperate the 
Jewish children who had been hidden by Catho
lic authorities or Cat
holic individuals and 
when I argued with him...this was November 1945...and said that we had...we were very 

grateful to the Catholic Chur
ch for what it had done in order to save some  Jews, Je wish 
children especially, but we had lost in the 
war one and a half million Jewish children, and 

we couldn't loose one more child. He questioned me , he questioned this statement and 

was absolutely astonished when I gave hi
m the statistical background to my _ . For 

twenty mi nutes we argued. I told him, you know, there were in Poland...the 

birthr ate...was a birthrate...a Jewish birthr
ate of sixty thousand every year. Multiply by 

16, 16...you can...you arrive at 960,000 children, up to 
the age of sixteen. We should have 
in 1945 at the end of the War, found 960,000 
Jewish children in Poland. Do you know 

how ma ny we found?  Some thing like 3,640 kids. 
There is a report by uh Jewish leader, 
Louis Seeger who come s  back from Poland 
and brings these fi
gures. take Hungary. 
Hungary with Transylvania, territories whic
h belonged...we call to Roma nia, about eight 
hundred thousand Jews. There were about 
four hundred thousand 
in the Hungarian 
provinces. On an average, there should ha
ve been a hundred thousand Jewish children. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
122 
 
Maybe a little less...eighty thousand. When th
e war was over, how ma ny J e wish children 
did we find? Eight children. He was shaken when I told him a nd I continued. I was well 
prepared to go on. He said they they they 
left. There was immigration. 55 | I said where 
was immi gr ation. Perhaps a few hundred, for ther
e I were still was to
 the mountains of 
Roma nia, but it's terribly difficult. Not thousa
nds...for twenty mi nutes we argued. It was 
one of my most unsuccessful diplomatic _ 
in my whole career. I shook him, there's no 
doubt. He...for the first time he realized that
 six million Jewish dead meant a million and 
a half Jewish children, but if the 
number two or three in the uh...  
 

Q:Hierarchy...  

 

A:Hierarchy...the the Catholic hierarchy, had to 
learn from me  to realiz
e in Nove mber when it 
was 1945, what this meant, this shows that uh 
not very high priority was given to these 
problems in the Vatican, and uh the other exam
pl e is I me ntioned already several time s. 
He went to the Vatican in August ninet
een hundred forty-two...uh '45, supported by some  
very important Catholic uh scholars, includ
ing Jack who became  later the cardinal, 
became the French Ambassador to the Holy S
ee, a very important, very distinguished 
Catholic scholar, including uh the uh priest  
in in in uh who became a cardinal later whose 
name escapes me at the moment, who ha
s written a very important book also in 
Catholic-Jewish relations, in
cluding uh a prelate of Egyp
tian-Jewish origin. A whole 
series of very uh distinguished Catholic theo
logians and they argued that this was a time 
for the Holy See to issue a Jewish on the re
lations with the Jews. There was no reply, and 
it took twenty years until vatican
 Council  56 II that the church
 really found that it had to 
issue a st at ement on the future of Christian- Je
wish relations, a very important stateme nt . 

It's  a beginning of a new approach to the Je
ws, but you see here the.. all these indications 
show that certainly the Jewish catastrophe was 
not seized in all its terrible dime nsions 
and it had certainly not priority in the cons
iderations of the vatican at the time.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
123 
 
 
Q: What about the role of th
e International Red Cross?   
 

A:The International Red Cross, you have today 
a very important study by Professor , uh the 
Geneva historian who ha s...is the only one w
ho had access to all the 
files, and the result 
of this study is not very positive to say the least. There are two positive things which I 

have to say sbout the Red Cross. The one is th
e fact that uh , Vice President, concerned to 
us in 1942 that he had also news about uh th
e final solution and that he had heard from 
several German diplomatic witnesses that th
e final solution was in 
in execution. This was 
a positive, a very positive fact for us to dete
rmine and to inform the Allies that this was a 
reality. The second is the ne
gotiations which I me ntioned before with and certainly 
contri buted to to help pr event the extermina
tion of the people who we
re still in the camps 
at the end of the war, but apart from this, 
the attitude of the Red cross was uh not very 
helpful, and not very uh courageous. There wa
s a mome nt when some of the me mbers of 
the Red Cross really  57 felt they had to 
ma ke an open protest against amongst other 

things the treatme nt of the Jews. Uh or at l
east an appeal in which these matters would be 
open...openly denounced but uh it never came to
 this appeal or public protest. 
It's...although I must admit there was a major
ity of the me mbers of
 the International 
Committee who were in favor of such . But 
here the Swiss governme nt intervened and 
prevented any such declaration. Uh I've b
een often asked whether this should have 
happened or not. In my opinion, there are 
mo me nts for international organizations, 
welfare organizations, where you have to speak
 out, and I wa s asked by the Red Cross at 
the time ...I clearly recommended and pushed and 
was very active in order to that such a 
statement of denunciation should happen, but 
it didn't happen and was prevented, as I 
said, by the swiss governme nt wh
ich was afraid of the Germans. Uh but nevertheless, at 

certain mo ment our insistence of decisive 
action had some  result. There was in 1942, in 
September '42, and the dates are very importa
nt because this is the mo me nt where we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
124 
 
informed uh _ that we knew about the final 
solution and he confirme
d to us that he knew 
too. Uh there the Red Cross sent a me morandu
m to their delegation in Germany in which 
uh they left it to the decision of the delega
tion if they should uh submit to the German 
authorities uh a request for the extension of 
the basic rules of Red 
cross protection to the 
intern...interned people in the va
rious camps and not in the camps of prisoners of war and 
the other camps. Uh this activity, this act
ion had no consequences. That wa s the most 
serious. They kept me  in the belief for tw
o I 58 years that they were pushing on this 
constantly and there were always
 new interventions in this sens
e. This is just not true. 's  
book ma kes it very clear that until the uh situ
ation developed in Hungary in 1945 which 
we have described, practically nothing has ha
s happened, and this is in my opinion a very 
serious mi stake and uh very serious failure 
of the Red Cross. Moreover, the book of _ 
brings out a number of ve
ry unpleasant facts. For instance, the Red Cross accepted 
without protest a request of the German 
Red Cross that...I think it's 1941...it could be 
'42...that in the future inquiries about peopl
e who are lost...who are searched for, should 
in the future be submitted separately for alie
ns and non-aliens. That they accepted this 
distinction is certainly a scandal and certainly
 not in the line of uh Red Cr oss principles, 
and there are a number of other such inci
dents which are certainly not very good and 
show also the the very limited courage 
which the Red Cross had in countering the 
Germans. There's a historian who has...a Sw
iss historian, Mr. Paul Stouffer, who has 
denounced this attitude in an article concer
ning the case of . The twelve thousand Polish 
officers were murdered by the...by Russians. At the time , the uh Germa n governme nt and 

the Polish governme nt in exile both asked th
e International Red Cross to establish an 
inquiry commission in order to determine who wa s responsible for this act. Uh behind all 

this was the governme nt...was the propaganda 
mi nistry and uh the Red Cross could not 
accept the proposal because the third party hadn'
t and the third party were the Russians, 
and according to the pr inciples of ! 59 th
e Red Cross only when all involved could 
agree...could such a question could such an inquiry commission be established, but Mr. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
125 
 
Stouffer refers in this respect to the di arie
s of . Uh of course, the Germans were very 
upset that this inquiry commi
ssion didn't happen. Uh but in the diaries of uh he defends 
hims elf and says we couldn't 
ma ke a big fuss about this case. We are muc h too much 
depending on the International Red Cross conc
erning our own interests with regard to 
prisoners of war and other ot
her interned peoplein Allied countries and so on, which 
shows exactly that the Re d Cross disposed of
 higher prestige and stat
us in Germany when 
they believed themselves and all their hesitati
ons not to insist too much wi th the Germans 
because of the overwhelming power of the Ge
rmans, uh it..a t the time  is here really 
contradicted by one of the greatest witne
sses one could produce in
 which it said we 
depend on the good will of the Red Cross. This
 has never been taken serious and never 
been realized but by the responsible people in
 in Geneva. So the Red Cross today doesn't  
anymore really defend this position. For the 
first time under the new president there, , I 
saw recently articles in which they said ye
s, we didn't do enough at the time , but now we 

have another policy and so on so. And this is 
in a not the attitude 
uh of the deal on these 
ma tters muc h more in detail in my own autobiography. I was very much involved in the 

whole theater of Red Cross 
activities, and the book by you see day by day for how I 
pressured the Red Cross into action in the H
ungarian uh case and uh also in 's  book, there 
are I think 45 references I 60 to my activiti
es uh but it was certainly a very important 
activity also from our side and some  of 
it produced results but, of course, much too 
limited.  
 

Q: We  have a little less than ten mi nutes to go. 
I was going to ask you about uh relations with the 
Jewish agency and the Joint, but if you have 
something that you woul
d rather say that has 
not come  out yet, please feel free to take this time.  
 

A:No, we can speak about the the the nations
 that say they cooperation of the Jewish 
organizations in Geneva. I'm not speaking now
 on the on the world. Uh there have been 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
126 
 
very little described really. We  were not
 very good. With the agency I had very good 
relations with the head of the agency in Gene
va, , who was an old diplomat of the Zionist 
move me nt. He was even more pessimi stic than 
I was, and so pessimi s
tic that he real ly 
gave up doing things. He  has written enorm
ous a mount of letters in describing his 
despair, which is...I didn't  do this. I uh wasafraid partly of the censorship. Everything 
which we wrote went through censorship 
and I didn't want the , but uh there 
was...cooperation was alright. There were all 
kinds of uh little offices between which 
there was a good deal of jealou
sy, but while I was at the 
time upset by some of these 
personal problems, when you see it as a w
hole and it didn't make any difference on the 
whole scene. Uh the the Germans were so uh 
powerful whether we would have _ a little 
better together or not, wouldn't have ma de 
 61 any difference. The Joint is another 
chapter. The Joint gave instructions not to 
cooperate with . Had instructions from the 
Joint in in , New York, not to cooperate 
with us which was due to the uh competition 
between the World Jewish Congress in the Un
ited States which pursued rescue activities 
on its own and based on the collections in S
outh America and the Joint. My criticism 
with regard to the Joint is very clear. Until very
 late they di d not see that this was not just 
a general welfare undertaking which was necessa
ry but a special political rescue action. 
This they understood very ...and rescue and ph
ilotropic (ph) welfare is quite a different 
thing. The Joint even opposed Martin Gold
ma n's  proposal to the...Goldman was a ma n 
who had great ideas and great schemes. He 
had..in the war, during the war, two great 
ideas. The one was to approach the Allies and 
to take...to ask them to ask them that the 
Allies should offer to the German government to take the totality of Jews into the Allied 

camp, and to evacuate and the 
other camp would care for them
. This, of course, was a 
revolutionary idea. It was probably the only 
great idea uh that could be conceived, but it 
was imme di ately rejected by the British . The 
other idea was the constructive idea of a 
basic joint effort to rescue, and he pr opos
ed five...a fund of fi
ve million dollars of 
contribution from America, five million do
llars contribution fr om uh United...from uh 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0189  
127 
 
Britain and two million fr om the Jews. This was sa botaged by the Jews. The Joint was 
against it. The Joint was believing that th
ey had a kind of mo nopoly on Jewish defense 
and and and Jewish welfare activities, . _1  
62 and the governme nt shouldn't interfere. It 
was an absolute basi c mi stake. When the war 
was over, our greatest as
set was that we we 
succeeded in in convincing the Allied governme nt
s, the UN, to participate and take the 
responsibility for the surviving refugees. Th
e was based was based and financed by the 
governme nts, not by the Jewish organization. 
The UNDRA e ffort was based and here the 
World Jewish Congress had an important role
 in in uh introduci
ng this idea and this 
concept. The the fact that 
hundreds of thousands of people 
were in need was not the 
responsibility of private peopl
e. It was the responsibility of the uh world community,

and so uh both in number and both in the uh in
ternational refugee organi zation after the

emist nationalists have to be overcome  and 
only a concerted effort of the...of governme nts 
and of the Jewish people, of other peoples

happen, but you have to work that it shouldn't 
happen.
