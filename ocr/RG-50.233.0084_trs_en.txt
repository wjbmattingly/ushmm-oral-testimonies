Good
morning.

Lily:
 
Good
morni ng.

Anthony :
Perhaps
we
can
begi n
by,
since
we
have
already
interviewed
you
before
rr
we
know
a
lot
about
you,
when
you
were
born
rr
per
haps
you
can
describe
wha
t
it
was
like
growing
up
in
your
parents'
home
during
th e
19 30's.

Lily:
My
paren ts
were
a
young
professional
couple
and
as
a
child,
I
and
my
sister
had
a
very
comfortable
life.
We
ha d
a
nanny
who
took
care
of
us
be cause
my
mother
was
a
dentist
and
she
was
worki
ng.
It
was
re ally
a
very
pa storal,
pleasant
life .
We
were
good
taken
care
of;
we
wer e
sent
to
a
private
school,
we
took
ballet
and
music,
pia no
lessons.
My
parents
wanted
to
inject
into
us
as
much
cultur e
as
possible
so
we
used
to
go
to
childre
n's
plays
in
the
th
eater
and
to
the
operas.
Su mm erti me
we
used
to
go
to
have
very
ni ce
vacations
where
we
wer e
swimmi ng
in
th e
River
Vi lija.
We
had
l i ttle
friends;
we
had
rr
.
Mo st
of
the
peopl e,
the
li ttle
girls
and
boys
we
associated,
were
in
the
same
class
so
it
was
a
ve
r
y
sheltered
childhood.
We
actually
were
quite
h a ppy
with
our
life.

Anthony :
Now,
you
ha d
a
sister?

Lily:
 
Yes,
I
had
a
y o unger
sister.
Anthony :
What
was
her
name?

Lily:
Her
nam e
wa s
Raya.
Hebr ew
nam e,
Ra chel.
She
is
four
years
younger
than
I.
As
two
little
girls,
someti mes
we
used
to
fight
but
she
was
a
very
pre tty,
vivacious
girl.
We
got
along
qui te
well
except
tha t
she
was
mo
re
spoiled
tha n
I.
Li ke
from
the
be ginni n g,
I
was
told
that
I
have
to
be
a
professional.
It
was
not
rr
my
paren ts
di dn't
ask.
It
was
decid ed
that
I
have
to
go
to
medi cal
school
to
be
a
doctor.
For
he r,
was
deci de d
tha t
she
has
to
marry
somebody
well
r
off,
a
good
provide
r,
a
handsom
e
husban d,
children
and
she
just
had
to
be
like
a
lady
of
the
house,
a
hostess.
Just
looking
pr etty
and
behaving.
Anthony :
Is
that
something
she
wanted
to
be?
Lily:
Well,
she
accepted
this
role
from
the
be ginnin g.
Sh e
never
was
try
ing
to
have
good
grades.
She
was
just
passing
and
she
liked
the
ballet,
she
li ked
to
play
th e
pia n o.
Also
she
had
her
li ttle
friends
and
really
she
was
like
mentally
pre pared
to
a
very
pl easant
life,
being
very
spoiled
by
both
paren ts
and
the
nanny .

Anthony :
What
about
you?
Did
you
really
want
to
be
a
doctor
?

Lily:
It
was
not
a
qu
estion
that
I
want
to
be
a
doctor.
It
wa s
just
put
bef o re
me
that
fait
accompli
and
I
just
had
to
be
and
rr
.
Als o ,
I
like d
to
s t udy.
As
strange
as
it
sound s
today,
I
really
rr
I
was
very
in
t
erested
in
r eading.
When
I
was
six
years
old,
I
was
introduced
to
books
and
I
was
a
voracious
reader.
I
was
very
inte rested
in
a
lo t
of
things.
Also
in
school
I
wa s
a
very
good
studen t
and
it
used
to
com e
very
easy
to
me.
I
didn't
have
to
study
a
lot.
When
I
had
to
write
an
es
say
I
could
wr
ite
it
in
two
minu tes.
I
used
to
write
a
few
essays
for
my
li ttle
friends
that
had
difficulties.
I
was
not
crazy
about
ma th
but
somehow
I
manage d
and
I
used
to
be
a
tea
cher 's
pet
.

Anthony :
I
noti ced
your
report
card
and
it
was
quite
good.

Lily:
 
Thank
you.

Anthony :
Now
your
littl e
sister
went
to
the
same
school?
Lily:
 
Yes.
We
went
to
a
private
school.
Anthony :
Was
this
a
Je wish
school?

Lily:
This
was
a
private
Jewish
s chool
tha t
only
Jewish
children
went
to
there.
We
we
r
e
off
on
Saturdays
and
Su nday
was
a
school
day
bu t
all
th e
instructions
were
in
Polish.
We
also
had
two
times
a
week
Hebrew
but
e v erything
wa s
taugh t
in
Polish.

Anthony :
What
was
the
langua ge
in
your
househ old?

Lily:
When
I
was
a
littl e
girl,
my
parents
spoke
Russian
be cause
when
they
went
to
th e
university
and
before
I
wa s
born,
Vilna
was
occupi ed
by
Russia
and
th e
young
people,
at
this
ti me,
spoke
Russian.
Then
when
I
started
to
get
older,
my
fa ther
one
ti me
came
from
work
and
said
we
hav
e
to
speak
Polish.
The
chil
d
will
have
to
go
to
a
Polish
school
and
she
is
still
talki n g
Russian.
Th en
they
were
starting
to
speak
Polish
bu t
when
their
fri ends
came
and
when
they
are
talking
between
themselves,
Russian
was
the
la nguag e
that
they
spoke.
Anthony :
Did
th
ey
speak
any
other
la nguages
between
Russian
and
Polish?
Lily:
There
was
a
Jewish
paper
that
use d
to
come.
My
mo ther
didn 't
read
Jewish
bu t
my
father
read
the
Jewish
paper.
I
i magine
tha t
my
mo ther
spoke
Jewish.
But
when
she
spoke
with
her
friends
or
her
family,
it
was
mostly
in
Russian.
Do
you
know
the
Jewish
population
had
thre
e
laye
rs
of
society?
There
were
these
peopl e
that
were
assimilated
Jews
and
th e y
mainly
spoke
Russian
and
Polish.
There
were
the
people
that
were
young
Zionists
and
they
sent
their
chi l dr en
to
Hebrew
School
and
they
were
tryi ng
to
make
He
b
rew
a
living
lan guage.
The
third
layer
of
the
Jewish
society
was
people
that
believe
that
Y iddish
is
the
l a nguage
of
the
Jewish
pe ople.
There
were
very
fa mous
ﬁRagymnasiumﬂ
[?]
(88)that
were
taug ht
only
in
Jew ish
and
the
children
were
sent
to
this
school.
They
were
tau ght
Yiddish
and
they
we
re
speaking
be
tween
the mse lves
also
in
Yid dish.
There
wer e
like
three
la yers
of
Jewis h
society.
Un fortunately,
my
parents
wer e
very
assimilated
and
they,
beca use
of
their
professional
backgrou nd,
felt
that
the
Russian
revolution
and
the
Russian
langua ge
is
kind
of
salvation
for
all
people.
They
believe d
in
all
the
ideals
that
sounded
very
ni
ce
on
pa
per
but
u nfortuna tely
fell
apart
later.

Anthony :
So
you
would
descri be
your
parents
as
being
Socialists
at
that
time ?

Lily:
No,
they
wer e
not
Socialis t,
I
mean
may be
as
young
s tude nts.
As
y o ung
students
they
believed
in
all
the
revolutionary
ideals.
I
remember
that
my
father
used
to
just
ask
me
from
tim
e
to
time
to
sing
the
Interna tional.
I
had
a
good
voice
and
even
when
the
Russian
ca me ,
his
big gest
pleasure
was
just
when
I
was
singing
the
International
for
him.
He
believed
in
those
ideas,
equali ty,
was
very
i dealistic
about
it.

Anthony :
Definitely
not
a
Stali
n
ist
bu t
rr
.

Lily:
No,
no,
no.
Was
very
ide a listic
becaus e
at
this
time,
when
he
was
a
student,
all
those
ideas
of
Leni n
and
Trotsky
were
very
much
in
the
mi nd
of
the
young
students
who
believed
very
dee ply
that
the
oppressed
people
have
to
uni te
and
everybody
ha
s
the
same
right.
Religion
shoul dn't
imprison
people .
So
they
were
very
idealisti c
and
very
much
for
equal
rights
for
everybody.
Anthony :
Would
you
describe
your
parents
as
be ing
secular,
more
secular
than
re ligious ?
Lily:
Very
secular,
very
secular.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
di dn't
know
that
I
was
Jewish
un
t
il
I
went
to
school.
It
was
a
very
hard
experience
for
me
be cause
a
lot
of
people
that
I
went
to
school,
the
chil dr en,
were
from
religious
families.
When
I
went
to
school
the
first
day,
my
nanny
prepar ed
me
my
lunch.
It
was
a
Kaiser
roll
with
butter
an
d
ham
.
I

had
no
idea
that
there's
something
wrong.
When
I
opened
the
lunch
and
ther e
are
childre n,
who
can
be
very
cruel,
saw
my
lunch;
they
s a id,
you
are
not
Jewish .
I
s a id,
yes
I
am
Jewi sh.
I
mea n
it
was
like
a
revelation
for
me
tha t
it
ca m e
out
that
I
was
Jewish.
I
started
to
cry
.
I
didn't
wa
nt
to
eat.
Th ey
said
to
me,
do
you
know
th at
Jewish
childre n
are
not
allowed
to
eat
ha m
and
do
you
kno w
that
Jewish
chil dren
are
not
allowed
to
rip
paper
or
gr ab
something
on
a
Sa turda y .
When
my
nanny
came
to
pick
me
up
,
I
was
in
tears.
When
I
came,
she
called
my
mother.
We
sat
down
and
I
told
her
the
whole
sto ry.
She
told
me
I'm
Jewis h,
we
are
not
religious,
but
we
are
Jews
and
you
are
going
to
Jewish
school
with
Jewish
children.
I
ha d
a
very
good
friend
of
mi
n
e
and
every
Friday
night,
th ey
us ed
to
light
candles.
When
I
went
there
and
I
saw
tha t
they
are
lighting
candles,
I
was
very
impress ed
with
the
whole
din ner
and
every thing
tha t
was
rr
.
I
cam e
home
and
I
said
to
my
mo ther,
I
was
tol d
tha
t
Go
 d
will
pu nish
us,
we
don't
light
ca ndles.
I
was
so
distressed
that
r
my
moth er
went
out
and
bou ght
tw o
candlesti cks
and
she
started
to
light
candles
on
Frid ay
just
to
pacify
me.
Because
it
was
a
revelation
for
me.
I
started
to
ask
her
beca use
I
never
knew
my
gran
dpar ents.
Then
she
told
me
that
her
fat
her
who
passed
away
at
a
young
age,
was
a
religious
Jew,
was
not
fanatic
with
a
big
white
beard.
The n
I
kin d
of
was
researching
my
back ground
and
I
was
very
impressed
and
this
is
ho w
I
come
to
know
my
heritage.
Anthony
:
Did
you
speak
any
other
la nguages
besi des
Polish?

Lily:
Yes,
I
speak
Russian.
I
speak
Spanish,
Castellan
Spa n ish.
I
speak
Y iddish.
I
used
to
speak
and
wr ite
a
very
good
German.
Even
I
used
to
write
the
Go t hic
Ger man
but
I
have
a
mental
block
now
and
I
just
rr
I
ge
t
very
upset
eve
n
when
I
hear
the
language
even
spoken
so
I
don't
cou nt
Germa n.

Anthony :
When
you
were
young,
gr owing
up
in
V ilna,
could
you
speak
Yid di s h?

Lily:
No,
no.
I
lear ned
to
speak
Yiddish
when
I
was
brou gh t
into
gh etto.
Because
when
I
was
brought
into
gh
etto,
I
met
ther
e
people
tha t
if
I
would
live
in
Vilna
a
h undr ed
years,
I
would
never
me et
those
kind
of
people .
I
gre w
up
in
a
very
sheltered
and
restricted
li ttl e
society.
My
peers
spoke
Polish,
only
Polish.
But
when
I
ca me
to
the
ghetto,
I
met
all
kinds
of
people;
I
started
to
min
g
le
and
I
learned
Yiddish.
I
know
the
alphabet
be cause
I
was
taught
He brew
as
a
chil d
when
I
went
to
school,
but
I
never
learned
to
read
Yid dish.
I
also,
there
was
a
time
that
I
know
quite
well,
White
Russian,
but
not
anymore.
Anthony
:
Earlier
you
di
vided
the
Jew ish
population
of
Vilna
into
three
group s ?
Lily:
 
Yes.

Anthony :
Which
would
you
say
was
the
most
nu m erous
of
the
three?

Lily:
It's
very
hard
for
me
to
say.
I
would
say
the
most
numerous
were
the
Yi ddish
r
speaking
peo ple.
Th is
was
the
most
nu
merous.
This
was
actually
the
working
r
class
language.
Th
ere
were
a
lo t
of
very,
very
poor
peopl e,
Jewish
peo ple,
in
Vilna
that
lived
in
basem ents
and
had
a
very
hard
life .
They
were
speaking
Yid dish.
Those
people
who

were
assimila ted
and
those
people
that
spoke
Hebrew
were
more
elitist
and
th ey
were
fewer.
Anthony :
Mino rity?
Lily:
 
Mi no rity,
yes .

Anthony :
Your
nanny,
you
mentione d
your
na nny .
Your
nan ny
was
not
Jewish?

Lily:
No,
she
was
a
Polish
girl
th at
was
a
rr
.
The
day
that
my
mother
b r ought
me
fr
om
th
 e
hospital,
she
was
there
already.
She
wa s
brought
over
beca use
my
moth er
was
a
working
dent ist,
yes,
she
was
a
working
woman.
She
was
a
young
girl
at
this
ti me
and
my
mother
ki nd
of
rr
.
My
mother
was
a
very
good
he art
person.
She
ki nd
of
ta ught
her
manners
and
she
kin
d
of
took
her
into
th e
family.
She
was
never
outside.
She
was
always
a
me mber
and
she
was
very,
very
fond
of
my
mother.
Af ter
she
became
a
memb er
of
the
family,
she
kin d
of
took
over.
I
tell
you
a
little
instance.
Ever y
morning,
she
used
to
dress
me
up
,
ve
ry,
very
ni ce ,
even
with
gl oves.
We
used
to
go
to
a
park.
The
park
was
called
Kataje nka.
Over
th ere
the
other
nanni es
wer e
brin ging
th eir
little
childre n
from
parents
tha t
were
in
th e
same
class
and
all
the
nann ies
used
to
br ag
about,
oh
my
lady
di
d
this
and
my
lady,
they
we

to
this
theater
and
they
had
this
and
all
rr
it
was
li ke
kind
of
a
competi tion
be tween
how
the
childre n
were
dressed.
When
my
nan ny
decided
that
I
needed
a
new
dress;
she
di d n 't
go
to
my
mother
or
my
father
to
ask.
She
we
n
t
to
a
store
where
we
had
a
credit,
she
chose
the
material.
Sh e
went
to
a
dressmaker,
she
chos e
th e
style.
The
dressmaker
knew,
already,
that
she
is
reliable.
After
she
di d
it,
she
also
went
and
boug ht
me
a
new
pai r
of
shoes,
a
new
pair
of
gloves;
she
came
and
she
said
to
my
mother,
you
know,
I
did
today,
this
and
this
and
this.
My
mother
would
ne
ver
say
no
to
her
bu
t
when
my
father
got
the
bills
and
he
used
to
question
her,
she
used
to
say,
what
do
you
want
me
to
go
with
your
littl
e
girl
rr
like
a
pauper
to
the
park?
My
father
wo uld
never,
ne ver
speak
aga inst
her .
She
was
just
like
the
boss.
She
kne w
that
she
ha s
to
take
care
of
her
l i ttl e
girls
later
on
rr
in
th e
begin ning,
just
me.
She
knew
that
she
had
to
take
care
of
my
mother
and
she
was
a
part
of
the
fa
mily.

Anthony
:
What
ki nd
of
house
did
you
live
in?

Lily:
I
lived
in
an
apartment
house.
I
was
bo rn
in
an
apartment
house
on
Ludwisarska
Four.
My
mother 's
office
was
right
there .
She
had
an
office
and
she
had
a
waiting
room.
Then
th
ere
were
quar ters,
living
quarters.
But
when
my
sister
was
born,
the
apartment
became
too
small.
We
move d
to
Pilsasker o ,
where
we
lived
un til
193 9.

Anthony :
That
was
also
an
apartment?
Lily:
This
was
an
a partmen t.
We
lived
on
the
second
floor.
It
was
a
very
nice
apartment
with
a
balcon
y.
They
were
very
ni ce
qu arters.
My
mother
also
ha d
an
office
and
th ere
was
a
waiting
room.
Also
there
was
a
ro om
for
my
na nny.
It
had
two
entrances .
One
was
the
entra nce
that
you
went
into
the
kitche n
and
one
was
a
front
en
trance
that
the
patien
t
use d
to
come .
It
was
beautiful
f urnished.
When
I
was
tryi ng
to
furnish
my
house
rr
when
I
married
and
I
settled
dow n
rr
I
always
was
trying
to
i mitate
whatever
I

saw.
Like
we
had
a
gran df ather
clock
and
I
had
a
gra ndfather
cloc k.
We
had
a
piano
and
I
did n't
have
furniture
yet
but
I
bou ght
a
piano,
the
first
thi ng
we
boug ht
a
piano.
I
always
rr
even
the
coloring
rr
if
you
look
at
my
apartment,
this
is
th e
coloring
that
I
was
trying
to
imitate
Anthony
:
Very
interesti
ng.
So
that
was
the
yardstick
by
which
you
measured
good
taste?

Lily:
Good
taste,
yes.
My
moth er
had
a
very
good
taste.
I
never
saw
my
mother
without
a
hat
and
a
pai r
of
gloves.
She
was
a
very
good
looking
woman,
a
be
autiful
wo
man
and
on
Fridays
was
her
day
off.
Before
I
started
s chool,
when
I
was
a
little
girl,
my
biggest
pleasure
was
Fridays.
Because
in
the
mo rning,
she
us ed
to
dress
up
and
we
use d
to
go
and
do
errands,
whatever
she
had
to
do
on
her
day
o ff.
S
trange
men
on
the
str
eet
used
to
tip
th eir
hat
to
my
mother.
I
wa s
very
proud
that
this
is
my
mother .
It
was
a
real
rr
like
I
wa s
admiring
he r,
not
only
be cause
she
wa s
very
good
but
because
she
was
very
attractiv e.
When
I
r e memb er
my
mother,
I
always
see
her
in
the
white
doctor
coat,
this
is
how
I
remember
her
or
when
she
was
walking
on
the
s
t
reet
dressed
up
with
the
hat
and
the
gloves
and
men
just
ti ppin g
their
hat
to
her .
Anthony :
Your
paren ts
wanted
you
to
be
li ke
her?
Lily:
I
don 't
know
if
they
wanted
me
to
be
li
ke
her
bu
t
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
I
have
to
be
in
the
medi cal
profession.
I
mea n
it
was
no
question
asked;
it
was
just,
this
is
how
I
was
groomed
to
be.

Anthony :
Did
you
live
in
a
mai nly
Je wish
neig hbo rhood
or
was
it
a
mi
xed
ne
ighborhood?

Lily:
It
was
a
mi xe d
nei ghborho o d.
We
lived
nearby
from
the
medi cal
f a culty
of
th e
university.
I
remember
the
riots,
it
started
at
th e
syn a gogue
riots
and
it
was
very
hard
for
the
Jew
to
go
to
a
me dical
universi ty,
a
me dical
college.
In
P
o land,
it
was
different.
When
you
finished
hi gh
school,
you
did n't
go
to
colle ge.
You
go
ri ght
away
to
university
and
you
had
to
make
up
your
min d
wha t
you
wanted
to
study.
Now
here,
here
you
go
to
college
and
the n
you
go
to
me dical
s c hool
or
to
la w
school.
Ov
er
there,
it
was
differ e nt.
It
was
very
hard
for
a
Jew
to
go
in
and
study
med i cine.
From
the
whole
school
that
I
went
to ,
it
was
a
private
school,
just
one
person
was
accepted
per
year
for
a
per iod
of
two
or
three
years.
So
those
few
medi cal
st
udents
that
wer
e
in
the
university
studying
medi ci ne,
Jew ish,
were
really
per s ecute d.
There
was
a
ti me
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
sit.
Th ey
were
assigned
spe cial
seats
on
the
lef t.
Th ey
rebelled
and
they
were
sta nding
up
and
they
were
taking
notes
du ring
the
lecture.
I
met
some
people
after
liberation
that
were
med
i
cal
stude nts
in
V ilna
and
th ey
were
telling
me
about
those
ti m es.
I,
myself,
remember
th at
th ere
wer e
riots
and
my
mother
came
runni ng
to
school
to
pi ck
me
up
becau s e
she
was
afraid
tha t
I
should
be
assaulted
by
those
peopl e
that
were
jus t
rioting
nearby
where
we
were
living.

Anthony
:
Do
you
know
why
your
par
ents
sent
you
to
a
private
Jewish
school?

Lily:
My
pare nts
wanted
me
to
have
th e
best
education
and
th is
was
a
very
fine
scho ol,
one
of
the
best.
I
wish
I
could
give
my
chil dr en
the
kind
of
education
that
I
and
my
sister
had
as
childr
en.
Th
e
professors
were
very
educate d ;
they
were
hi ghly
d edi cate d.

Mo st
of
the
s tude nts
wer e
motivated.
There
were
some
childre n
that
went
there
just
to
please
thei r
parents
and
tried
to
get
away
but
we
had
movies,
we
had
a
chemical
laboratory,
we
had
a
physi cs
laboratory;
we
ha d
field
trips;
we
had
a
gym,
gy m
was
important;
we
had
all
ki
nd s
of
visual
aids
to
make
the
education
more
interes
ting.
Also
when
we
ha d
Fren ch
Revol ution,
they
were
tea chin g
us
about
Fre nch
Revolution.
It
was
not
that
they
told
us
about
Robespierre
and
Mar a t,
but
we
ha d
a
mo ck
judgment.
There
was
a
j udge
assigne d;
there
was
somebody
who
was
Mara t,
who
was
Robespierre
and
somebody
that
was
jus
t
from
the
pe
ople.
The
his tory,
all
of
a
s udden,
becam e
alive .
I
just
recently
me t
a
friend
of
mi ne
tha t
I
did n't
see
for
many,
ma ny
years
and
we
started
to
talk.
He
said
he
was
amazed
how
alive
the
Fren ch
Revol ution
becam
e
when
we
were
students.
Ever
y
class
had
a
school
paper.
We
had
to
write
articles;
the
class
paper
wa s
coming
out
every
month.
The
best
article
from
th e
class
paper
was
put
in
th e
school
paper.
Those
articles
wer e
amazing.
This
is
rr
th e
atmosphere
was
very
con ductive
to
bri ng
up
an
intel
ligent
hu
man
bein g.
Th is
is
the
reason
I
was
sent
there.
Anthony :
How
would
you
characterize
rela tions
between
Jews
and
non
r
Jews
in
Vilna?
Lily:
There
were
a
lot
of
anti
r
Se mites.
I
thi nk
that
I
told
in
the
previous
i nterview
that
my
father
was
re ally
having
a
very
hard
tim
e
when
he
went
for
an
exam.
You
see,
my
father
was
w o rking
in
a
pharmacy.
This
was
a
pharm acy
from
a
very
big
phar macy
that
was
fro m
the
city
ph armacy.
Ever y
worker
that
worked
had
a
kind
of
insurance.
When
he
nee ded
a
prescri ption,
he
went
to
this
pha
rmacy.
It
wa
s
a
very
big
o utfit;
it
was
called
ﬁC asa
Horichﬂ
[ phoneti c]
(32 4 ).
It
was
like
a
big
insurance
for
the
workers.
From
th is
ph armacy
was
employed
a
lot
of
pharma cists,
only
three
Jewish
phar macists
were
employed.
In
1935,
those
three
pharmacists
were
told
tha t
they
don't
ha ve
enough
education;
they
have
to
go
and
pass
a
test
.
They
cannot
do
just
a
simple
pharmacist;
they
have
to
have
Masters
in
phar macy.
It
was
called
Magister
der
Pharmazie.
Here
was
my
father,
a
young
man,
with
a
wife
and
tw o
childr en,
and
he
had
to
go
to
work
and
als o
study.
I
re
memb er
that
he
used
to
go
and
di g
up
all
kinds
of
herbs
and
study
all
kinds
of
things.
He
used
to
close
himself
and
study
whatever,
he
just
had
a
chance.
Then
he
went
for
the
test .
The
te st
was
in
the
medi cal
faculty
of
the
university .
Unfortu nat ely
th
ere
was
a
professor
there
and
his
name
was
Macheski,
one
of
th e
bi ggest
anti
r
Semites.
He
passed
the
written
test
and
then
he
passed
th e
oral
test.
As
he
was
comin g
out,
he
asked
hi m,
by
th e
way,
what
is
the
ch emi cal
formula
for
carbonated
water?
My
fa ther
was
so
u
nnerved
that
he
got
a
men tal
block
and
he
di dn't
answer
hi m.
He
didn 't
pass
the
test .
So
he
had
to
study
again
and
he
had
to
travel
to
Warsaw.
He
went
ther e
and
he
passed
the
test
there.
I
remember
when
he
sent
us
a
telegra m,
"I
passed! "
and
it
was
one
of
the
big
g
est
joys
for
us.
But
it
didn't
take
long
and
all
thr e e
Jewish
pharmacists
were
told
that
they
had
to
go.
They
didn't
wa nt
a
Jew
to
have
a
civil
service
job.

Anthony :
So
even
thou gh
he
got
the
Masters
and
he
qualified,
he
still
lost?
Lily:
Yes,
he
lost.
Then
we
had
like
a
fa
mily
pow
r
wow.
He
lost
the
job.
We
did n't
know
what
to
do.
So
it
was
deci ded
that
ever ybody
will
he lp
hi m
and
he
will
have
to
buy
a
pharmacy
be cause
he
coul dn't
ge t
a
job.
When
he
went
to
bu
y
a
pharmacy,
he
found
a
pharmacy
in
a
pla ce
call ed
So
s
y
[Salos],
S
r
o
r
l
r
y.
As
a
Jew,
he
cou ldn™t
buy
the

pharmacy
so
somehow
he
found
a
Polis h
phar macist
whose
name
was
Vishnefski.
He
gave
him
a
sum
of
mon ey,
this
Vishnefski
boug ht
th e
pharma cy
and
my
father
was
the
owner
and
he
worked
th e r e.
This
Vishnefski
was
no t
even
there.
This
was
in
1 938.
Anthony :
That's
when
he
lost
the
shop?

Lily:
He
lost
his
job
in
1936
or
1937.
For
a
ye
ar
or
a
year
and
a
half,
he
didn
't
work.
There
were
a
lot
of
anti
r
Se mites.

Anthony :
Did
you
notice
whether
th ere
was
any
difference
be tween
Poles
and
Lithuania ns,
for
example?

Lily:
Well,
actually ,
I
di dn't
get
in
tou
ch
durin
g
my
ch ildho od
too
mu ch
with
Li thua ni ans.
I
started
to
kn ow
Lithuan ians
when,
in
1 940,
Russia
took
over
and
it
then
be came
Lithuania.
So
for
a
year,
you
know,
but–
also
I
got
in
touch
with
Lithuanians
when
they
were
guard in g
th e
ghetto.
They
were
very
tall,
the:
policemen.
We
used
to
call
the
m
ﬁaniterateﬂ
[? ]
(391 ),
th is
how
tall
they
were.
Lith ua nians
were
also
very
anti
r
Semitic,
very
anti
r
Semitic,
espe cia lly
those
who
were
sympathizers
with
th e
Germans.

Anthony :
If
you
had
to
compare
the
two,
would
you
say
that
one
was
worse
than
th e
other?
Lithuania n
anti
r
Semitism
or
Polish?

Lily:
I
would
say
they
were
just
rr
both
of
the m
were
bad.
It
is
hard
to
compare.

Anthony :
Earlier,
you
mentioned
th at
th ere
wer e
some
anti
r
Se miti c
pogrom s?

Lily:
They
were
actually
no t
po groms.
They
were
riots
be tween
th e
students,
betw een
the
Polish
studen ts
and
the
Jewish
students
and
the
uni
versity.

Anthony
:
But
you
wer e
prote cte d
from
all
that
because
you
were
still
going
to
the
Jewish
school?
Lily:
 
I
was
prote cted
beca us e,
first
of
all
I
wa s
a
littl e
girl
and
I
was
going
to
a
Jewish
school.
Anthony :
How
about
your
mother?
Who
were
he r
clie
nts?

Lily:
My
mother
had
a
lot
of
non
r
Jewish
cli e nts.
I
remember
that
well
r
to
r
do
Polish
landowners
used
to
come
to
her
and
they
used
to
co me
with
a
ho rse
and
b ugg y.
They
used
to
come
like
th e
drive r
used
to
sit
in
th e
front
of
the
house
and
wait
for
the
m.
They
were
very
tall,
young
men,
middl e
r
aged
men.
A
lot
of
th em
used
to
come
with
boots
and
th ey
used
to
bend
down
and
kiss
my
moth er's
han d.
Es pecially
in
th e
springti me,
they
use d
to
bring
her
like
s trawberries
or
fresh
things .
My
mother
was
a
very
good
de
ntist
and
she
had
a
very
good
repu tatio n
tha t
she
ha d
a
very
light
hand,
they
used
to
say,
for
extraction
of
the
teeth.
She
us ed
to
make
very
nice
false
teeth.
She
had
a
de ntal
mechani c
that
was
w o rking
with
her.
Those
people
used
to
come
for
miles
to
her
because
they
used
to
like
her
work.
Of
course,
I
mentioned
that
they
trusted
her
if
they
came
to
her.
They
us
ed
to
someti mes
bring
th eir
wives,
children
to
attend
her .
But
there
was
one
day
that
my
mother
used
to
do
a
lo t
of
pro
bono
work.

Any
poor
Jewish
or
non
r
Jewish
people
knew
that
if
they
have
a
toothache,
they
can
ring
the
bell
and
they
can
come
in.
She
would
just
he lp
them
and
cure
them
and
do
whatever;
she
would
treat
the m
li ke
th e
most
expe nsive
patien ts
and
she
woul dn't
charge
the m.
Sh e
just
had
this
obligatio
n
to
do
good.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
when
I
was
in
concentration
cam ps,
I
met
a
few
pe ople
tha t
said
to
me,
you
know,
I
know
you.
I
used
to
see
you
in
your
mother's
office.
So meti mes
I
would
sneak
in.
I
used
to
pretend
that
I
am
a
hel
per.
I
would
just
stay
in
the
co rner
and
look.
A pparen tly
they
saw
me.
You
know
that
yo ur
mother
di dn't
charge
me
at
all.
We're
poor
people
and
she
was
just
like
an
angel
to
us.
One
of
the
wo men
worked
in
the
kitch en
and
she
use d
to
help
me
bec
au
se
my
mother
helped
her
when
she
was
a
little
gi rl
and
she
ha d
a
toothache.
This
is
my
reco llection
about
the
rr
.
Anthony :
A
very
r
loved
mother?

Lily:
 
Yes,
a
very
go od
person.

Anthony :
The
poorest
classes
and
th e
richest
classes?
Lily:
Yes.
She
always
rr
and
I
re
memb er
her
telling
me
if
you
see
some
body
tha t
puts
a
hand
out,
you
have
to
put
something
in
it.
We
always
had
a
few
boxes
in
our
house .
One
box
was
for
o r phans,
one
blue
box
was
to
buy
land
fo r
Israel,
ther e
was
Keren
Kayemet.
It
was
a
Hebre
w
organizatio
n
and
when
we
used
to
get
allowance,
we
ha d
to
pu t
a
few
pennies
into
this
box.
When
I
got
older
and
I
started
to
think
abo ut
Israel
and
all
the
th ings,
I
was
very
mu ch
interested
in
it.
I
was
very
plea sed
tha t
eve n
my
mother
was
not
a
Zionist
but
sh
e
ha
d
the
sense
tha t
you
have
to
help;
that
you
have
to
kind
of
go
out
and
start
to
think
about
your
own
land
if
you
are
to
be
a
whole
person.
So
charity
I
le arned
in
my
house.
Anthony :
Charity
be gin s
at
home?

Lily:
 
Yes,
it
really
began
wi
t
h
me
at
home.
Anthony :
Now
1939
was
a
very
bad
year
for
your
f a mily?
Lily:
 
A
very
bad
year.

Anthony :
Before
the
war?

Lily:
Yes,
yes.
I
never
saw
my
mother
sick.
Then
in
1938,
she
went
to
a
doctor
and
she
was
diagnosed
as
having
cance
r
.
She
was
o perated
on
in
a
very
good
hospital.
She
was
opened
and
closed.
The
professor
that
operated
on
her
call ed
my
father
and
said
to
him;
unfortu nately
your
wife
has
a
mon th
or
two
to
li ve.
She
has
cancer
of
the
ovary
that
it
metastasized.
Your
two
little
girls,
you
have
to
think
about
it
and
you
hav
e
to
say
mentally
goodbye
to
her.
Of
course,
it
was
a
very
big
trage
dy
because
my
pa rents
r
r
they
me t
as
studen ts
and
they
had
a
very
good
relati onship.
My
father
put
my
mother
on
a
pedestal
and
he
cou l dn 't
believe
it
be
ca use
she
was
never
sick.
We
were
not
told
about
it.
We
were
very
sheltered.
My
aunt
Sonia
kind
of
took
over.
My
mother
was
brought
hom e;
th ere
was
a
hospital
bed
th ere
and
every
day,
she
was

taken
for
radi ation
treatments.
Some ti mes,
I
would
skip
school
and
I
was
going
with
her
for
the
ra diation
treatment.
She
was
taking
it
very
bad.
She
was
very
nau s eous
and
we
used
to
save
a
pie c e
of
herring
for
her
after
the
tr eatme nt ;
something
to
rr
the
nausea
should
go
away.
I
was
very,
very
distressed
ab
ou
t
it.
I
don 't
think
my
sis ter
realized
what
was
going
on
but
I
un derstood
and
after
a
while,
a
mi racle
happened.
She
kind
of
had
a
relapse,
just
hap pene d
to
feel
better.
When
she
was
sick,
she
was
lying
in
this
bi g
salon,
this
big
waiti ng
area
and
the
dog
,
Rex,
was
just
lying
there.
We
had
to
discon
nect
the
bell
because
peo ple
wouldn't
let
go.
The
pa tients
just
wa nted
to
come
and
say
hello
to
her
and
she
nee d ed
all
her
privacy
and
she
couldn't
conti nue
her
practi ce.
But
as
soon
as
she
got
better,
she
recovered,
and
she
started
to
practice
again.
She
started
slowly
but
all
of
a
su
dden,
everybody
came
ba
ck.
It
was
very
anxious
for
her
to
resume
practi ce.
Ma ybe
for
four
or
five
mon ths ,
everything
came
to
normal
and
then
she
had
a
relapse.
Af ter
a
month,
again
th e
hos pital
bed
cam
e
and
May
24th,
she
passed
awa
y.
My
aunt
Sonia,
who
was
a
midwif e
and
a
nurse,
took
care
of
her.
She
was
giving
her
all
medi catio n
bu t
there
was
nothing
we
coul d
do.
I
remember,
you
know
in
Je wish
tradi tion,
you
sit
Shiv a
and
my
mo ther
passed
away
on
a
Thursday.
It
was
the
first
day
of
a
Jewi
sh
holiday
cal
led
Shavuot
which
is
a
very
happy
holiday.
Sa turday
morning,
my
little
friends
came
to
take
me
out
and
it
was
in
May.
It
was
a
beautif ul,
beautiful
day.
In
May
in
Vilna,
the
l ilacs
were
blooming;
the
smell
in
the
ai
r
was
incre
di ble.
Th e
bir d s
were
singi n g
and
th e
sun
was
shining
and
I
was
walking
on
the
sidewalk
with
my
li ttle
friends
and
I
said,
my
Go d,
the
world
goes
on
and
my
mother
is
not
there.
I
also
have
to
me nti o n
to
you
tha t
my
mother
had
a
very
big
f
une
ral.
People
that
knew
her ;
all
the
patie nts
ca me,
all
the
stude nts
from
the
school
from
me
and
from
my
sister's
and
we
had
a
pr oblem
with
Rex
because
he
wanted
to
go
behi nd.
He
had
just
rr
had
to
be
ta ken
away.
I
reme mber
when
my
mother
passed
away
it
was
maybe
like
fou
r
o'
cloc
k
in
th e
mornin g,
and
in
my
ear
is
this
terrible
howling
of
this
dog.
This
do g
was
howlin g,
inhuman.
When
I
woke,
up
and
my
aunt
that
was
present,
started
to
cry .
Then
this
dog
has
to
be
taken
out
of
the
house
and
th
en
I
realize
that
I
lost
my
mother.
It
was
a
very,
very
hard
tim e
for
me.
I
was
always
a
good
stude nt
but
be cause
I
was
going
for
the
trea tme nts
with
my
mother,
my
grades
fell
do wn.
The
tea c her
ca me
to
pay
me
a
visit
and
he
says
to
me
you
should
come
back
to
school
and
im
p
rove
your
grades.
Wha t's
going
on?
After
all
you
were
always
like
a
very
good
student.
I
said
to
him,
I'm
sorry
I
just
cannot
do
it.
My
world
ended
and
I
just
cannot
do
it.
He
said
to
me
all
right,
ma
ybe
after
th
e
summer,
he
says,
we
will
put
you
like
ki nd
of
proba ti o n.
We
won't
give
you
the
bad
grade
becaus e
this
is
not
you.
Af ter
the
summer,
you
will
pass
the
exams,
and
then
we
will
give
you
the
report
car d.
I
says,
all
r i ght
bu t
I
just
could
n' t
bri
n g
myself
back
to
go
to
school
be cause
the
scho ol
year
ended
Ju ne
20,
so
I
still
had
ple nty
of
tim e
to
go,
I
just
coul dn't
do
it.
This
su mmer
was
a
very
sad
summer
for
me
because
me
and
my
sister
and
our
nanny,
we
were
sent
to
So
s
y
[Salos]
wh
e
re
my
father
had
the
ph armacy.
Tape
One,
Side
B
Anthony :
So
it's
the
su mmer
of
1939,
and
you'r e
in
So
s
y
[Salos]?

Lily:
Yes,
I'm
in
So
s
y
[Salos].
It
was
a
very
bi g
adjustment
for
us
beca use
all
of
a
sudden
we
met
different
youngsters
an
d
diff
erent
people.
We
were
very
he artbroken.
We
were
very
grateful
that
my
aunt
could
stay
with
us
for
a
month
w hich
was
kind
of
our
link.

She
beca me
our
second
mother;
she
to ok
over
very
swiftly.
The n
we
wer e
pre paring
ourselves;
in
Septe mber
th e
school
was
supposed
to
resume.
I
was
sittin g
in
a
hammock;
it
was
Septe mb er
1,
I
thin k,
r eading
a
book.
All
of
a
s u dden
my
nan ny
ca me
runnin g
and
she
said
your
father
wants
you
to
co
me
ov
er
right
awa y
to
the
phar macy.
This
wher e
we
found
out
that
the
war
broke
out
and
the
Ger mans
were
invading.
Then
th e
pandemonium
broke
be cause
all
of
a
sudd e n
So
s
y
[Salos]
beca me
White
Russia
and
we
were
isolated
from
Vilna .
My
aunt
sent
some body
to
take
both
of
us
to
her;
we
should
go
to
schoo
l
ther
e.
But
my
father
said
no,
they
have
to
be
with
me.
We
had
to
stay
in
White
Russia.
I
was
sent
to
the
s c hool
in
Ashmyana
beca use
ther e
was
no
high
s chool
th ere
and
my
sister
was
going
to
a
school
in
So
s
y
[Salos].
Th
is
is
rr
.
Anthony :
Goodbye
Vilna?
Lily:
Yes.
During
the
vacation,
my
father
sent
us
to
my
a unt
be cause
we
were
missing
her
a
lot.
We
went
ther e
and
we
stayed
ther e
duri ng
the
winter
va cation
for
a
week
or
two.
Anthony :
In
Vilna?
Lily:
In
Vilna,
ye
s.
But
I
just
did
n't
find
anything
because
most
rr
it
was
just
not
th e
Vi lna
tha t
I
reme mber e d.
It
be came
comple tely
di fferent
so
tha t
when
we
ca me
ba ck,
we
were
staying
till
19 41.
Anthony :
In
So
s
y
[Salos]?

Lily:
Yes
rr
no,
no t
in
So
s
y
[Salos]
be
cause
whe
n
the
Russian
ca me,
my
father
didn 't
get
a
passport
because
he
was
bourgeois.
He
was
th e
owner
of
the
ph armacy
so
he
was
persecuted
by
the
Russian
also.
They
to ok
away
th e
pharmacy
and
th ey
sent
us
to
a
small
village
called
Ostro w iec
[Ostrow eic
wi
'
tokr zyski].
Over
there,
he
be
ca me
the
manager.
My
sister
had
to
go
to
a
s
chool
there
and
I
was
still
in
Ashmyana.
In
1941,
the
war,
when
th e
Germa ns
took
over,
we
were
in
Ostrowiec
[Ostroweic
wi
'
tokrzyski ].
From
there ,
me
and
my
sister
escape d
back
to
Vilna
and
then
my
father
came.

Anthony
:
Now
your
aunt
Sonia,
she
was
your
mother's
older
sister?

Lily:
 
Older
sister,
yes.
Anthony :
Could
you
tell
us
a
li ttle
bi t
more
about
her?
She
was
a
mi dwife
and
a
nurse
in
V ilna?
Lily:
Yes.
My
mother
and
my
aunt
Sonia
were
very
close.
There
was
not
a
day
that
they
didn't
see
ea
ch
other.
When
my
Aunt
Sonia
was
a
young
girl,
she
was
romantically
involved
with
one
of
the
le aders
of
the
r evolution.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
she
esca ped
her
father's
house
and
she
wa nted
like
a
set
r
up,
they
bel ieved
in
free
r
love,
and
she
wanted
like
to
set
up
house
with
this
young
revolutionary.
Bu
t
my
gran
df ather
put
his
foot
down.
He
ca me
and
took
her
practicall y
by
the
hand
and
said
tha t
no
dau ghter
of
mine
will
do
this
thi ng.
She
was
a
very
good
r
looking
woman.
For
the
longest
ti me
she
didn't
have
a
boyfriend,
she
was
not
interested,
she
was
just
inter
e
sted
in
the
profession.
She
married
la te
in
life
and
her
wedding
was
in
our
house.
She
me t
this

very
nice
young
fellow
whose
name
wa s
Joseph
Pers ky.
After
the
weddin g,
after
the
honeymoon,
they
set
up
hous e,
not
far
from
us.
Anthony :
This
was
befo re
your
moth er
died?
Lily:
 
This
was
befo re
my
rr
.

Anthony :
During
the
1930's?

Lily:
Yes,
the
1930's.
I
was
very
close
with
he r
beca
use
there
was
not
a
day
tha t
she
didn't
come
to
our
house
or
we
didn't
go
to
her.
She
never
had
chil dren
and
she
was
very,
very
dedi cate d
to
both
of
us
and,
of
cour se,
to
my
mo ther.
My
mother
had
also
an
older
sister,
her
name
was
Esther.
She
was
married
with
two
children
but
th
er
e
was
a
very
big
bin di ng
with
those
two
sisters.
Actually,
after
my
mother
passed
away,
she
took
her
place.
When
we
escaped
from
Ostrowiec
[O stroweic
wi
'
tokrzyski]
and
me
and
my
sister
came
as
the
l i ttle
two
peasant
girls,
we
came
to
her
hou
s e.
We
were
staying
in
her
house;
she
was
very
good
to
us.
We
fo
und
shelter
and
comfort
in
her
house
and
my
father
also
stayed
in
her
house.
With
her,
we
went
to
the
ghe tto
when
the
Jews
fro m
Vilna
were
sent
to
th e
g hetto.
The
whole
ti me
in
g hetto,
we
were
togeth
er,
me
and
my
sister
and
my
aunt
and
my
father.
My
aunt
and
my
sister
sl
ept
in
one
be d
and
my
father
slept
on
th e
floor.
She
was
w o rking
in
the
Jewish
Hospi t al
as
a
nurse.
She
was
very
instrumental
in
saving,
actually,
my
life
be cau s e
I
was
in
the
hospital.
I
told
about
it
so
I
don't
want
to
repeat
it.
Bu
t
she
took
me
out
from
the
hospital
just
in
ti me
when
the
Ger mans
were
asking
for
500
peopl e,
Jews,
from
the
comman der
of
the
ghe tto .
He,
in
order
to
save
able
r
bodied
Jews,
said
to
them,
send
them
sick
pe
ople
from
the
hospital.
She,
being
a
nur se,
found
out
just
the
night
before
she
took
me
out.
The
whole
tim e
during
the
liqui dation
of
the
gh etto,
we
wer e
togeth er.
When
we
came
to
the
Rosa
Cemetery,
th ere
was
a
selection.
My
sister
looked
very,
very
young
so
my
aunt
took
off
a
pair
of
shoes
with
heels
an
d
she
gave
it
to
my
sister.
Also
she
stuffed
her
bosom
with
a
pair
of
socks.
We
were
all
thre e
going
togeth er.
I
don't
know
ho w
it
happe ne d
bu t
we
got
separated
fro m
my
aunt.
She
was
sent
to
th
e
le
ft
and
both
of
us
were
sent
to
the
right.
When
I
realized
that
she
was
sent
to
th e
le ft,
I
became
hysterical
and
I
was
running
back
to
the
left.
A
Germa n
SS
man
with
a
rifle
beat
me
over
the
head
and
says
to
me,
you
are
too
young.
Yo
u
have
to
work
for
the
Fatherland.
Took
me
off
the
floor
and
there
wer e
some
other
girls
just
took
me
away
and
I
nev er
saw
my
aunt
again.
Anthony :
Do
you
reme mber
that
da te?
Lily:
I
will
never
fo rget
it.
It
was
Sep tember
23,
1943;
it
wa
s
the
day
of
the
liq uidatio n
of
the
ghe tto.
This
was
the
la st
tim e
that
I
saw
her.
Anthony :
Mr.
Persky,
her
husban d,
was
he
separated
earlier?
Lily:
He
was
a
mer chant.
He
ha d
a
business
in
wild
mus hrooms
and
fur s .
He
had
a
lot
of
contac t
with
peasant,
buyi ng
from
the
m,
th
e
wild
mushrooms.
Also,
he
did n't
look
Jewish.
He
lo oked
very
mu ch
li ke
a
Pole.
So
before
rr
when
they
send
notices
th at
th ey
next
day
they
send
us
to
th e
ghe tto,
he
called
my
aunt
and
said
to
her,
he's
not
going

to
the
ghetto.
He's
going
to
the
coun try .
He
want
her
to
go
with
him.
But
she
said
she
cannot
separate
herself
fr om
th e
childr en
and
also
my
father
and
both
of
us,
me
and
my
sister,
we
look
very
Jewish.
He
cou ld
tak e
just
one,
her,
but
not
us.
She
said
tha
t
she
is
going
with
us
to
th
e
ghe tto
and
this
was
the
s a crifice
that
she
ma de.
Because
I
always
think
that
maybe
if
she
would
went
with
hi m
to
the
cou ntr y,
he
would
be
alive.
When
I
surviv ed,
I
was
sear ching
for
hi m .
I
was
asking
about
him,
but
I
coul
d
never
find
a
trace,
because
he
was
very
good
to
us.
Anthony :
So
you
don 't
know
whether
he
survived?
Lily:
 
I
don't
know,
I
don't
know.

Anthony :
When
your
a unt
was
youn g,
did
she
als o
atten d
the
university?

Lily:
 
Yes,
she
atte nded
th e
university,
yes.

Anthony :
The
same
one
as
your
mother?
Lily:
I
don
'
t
know
because
rr
.
I
don't
know
exactly.
I
know
that
there
wa s
always
talk
that
she
was
with
the
stude nts,
with
her
romance,
with
thi s
revolution.
There
was
always
like
family
secrets
and
thi ngs
like
this
about
my
stern
grandfa the r
who
pu t
his
foot
down
bu
t
I
don't
know
thi s
I
don 't
kno w .
I
imagine
because
this
is
what
they
were
sent
to
study
so
I
i magine
bu t
I
don't
know.
Anthony :
Now
your
father,
th ese
are
bad
years
for
your
father,
the
loss
of
his
job,
th e
lo ss
of
his
wife,
the
n
los
 s
of
the
ne xt
job,
and
being
forced
to
mo ve.
Now
wha t
hap pens
to
him
during
th ese
months?

Lily:
 
What
time
of
rr
?

Anthony :
He
was
in
So
s
y
[Salos]
and
then
he
loses
the
phar macy
beca use
he's
too
bourge ois.
Then
he
is
forced
to
move
to
Ostrowiec
[Ostroweic
wi
'
tokrzyski]
,
where
he
just
was
an
employee
rr
.

Lily:
 
He
was
a
manager.

Anthony :
Manager?

Lily:
Yes.
He
was
a
manager
and
it
was
a
small
pharma cy
and
he
was
the
only
one
that
worked
but
he
did n't
own
it.
Of
course
it
was
very
hard
years
for
him.
He
devel
o ped
a
lot
of
friends
hip
with
the
doctors
tha t
used
to
come ,
the
Russian
doctors
used
to
come
for
the
medi cine
over
ther e.
Sin ce
he
spoke
Russian
rr
but
when
the
German
ca me,
there
was
some
Russian
doctor
tha t
wa nted
to
take
us
dee p
into
Russia.
He
di dn't
want
to
do
it
because
he
said
tha
t
during
th e
war,
yo u
have
to
hav e
a
roof
above
your
head
so
he
di dn't
want
to
do
it.
But
as
soon
as
the
Russian
left
and
th e
Germa n
ca me,
a
lot
of
pogro ms
started
against
th e
Jew s ,
against
th e
Jews
in
Ostr owiec
[Ostroweic
wi
'
tokrzyski
]
.
When
the
Russian
were
ther e,
th e
Polish
landown ers
suffered
a
lot
because
they
were
jus t
the
same
bourg eois.
When
they
use d
to
come
to
the

pharmacy,
th ere
was
a
room
in
th e
ba ck
where
my
fa ther
used
to
prepare
their
medi cines
and
th ey
use d
to
congrega te
there.
They
used
to
come
rr
they
coul d
f r eely
talk
without
being
observed
by
th e
communists.
They
were
ki n d
of
friendly
so
when
the
pogroms
started,
one
of
them
ca m e
and
said
that
you
should
take
our
b
el
o ngings
and
he
will
save
us
and
he
will
take
us
to
this
bi g
hou s e
that
he
said
belon ged
(one
word
un clear ).
So
my
father
and
my
sis ter
put
some
belongin gs
on
th eir
wago n
and
he
took
the m
going
there
to
this
big
house.
On
the
way,
they
were
accosted
by
tw enty
Poles
and
my
father
was
put
agains t
a
tree,
blindfolded
and
they
wanted
to
shot
him
in
the
presence
of
my
little
sister.
They
just
hur t
hi m
but
we
suspected
that
it
wa s
arranged
by
the
landowne
r
who
wanted
just
to
ta
ke
the
belongi n gs
that
my
father
was
taking
and
scare
him .
When
my
father
came
home,
I
was
waiting
for
him.
When
I
saw
him
bleedi ng,
we
u ndersto od
that
they
were
just
false
people
that
want
to
ta ke
advantage
and
th ey
want
to
take
our
fur
niture,
our
bed
ding,
whatever
we
had
there.
My
father
went
to
th e
rabbi
of
the
hou s e,
of
the
littl e
town
and
said
to
him
th at
if
we
could
sleep
a
few
nig hts
th ere
be cause
our
life
is
in
d a nger.
Th e
r a bbi
le t
us
stay
over
there.
About
two
days
la ter,
he
sent
bot
h
of
us
wi
th
a
peasant
to
Vilna
and
then
he
waited
two
days
and
then
rr
we
be came
rr
.
Those
were
very
hard
ti mes
for
hi m.
First
of
all,
he
believ ed
in
those
people
that
wanted
to
save
us
and
it
was
a
very
bi g
le t
r
down
that
only
for
material
thing
bu
t
it
was
morally,
he
lo st
faith.
He
was
like
rr
her e
he
was
a
Jew
in
Poland;
the n
he
was
persecute d
by
the
Russian
as
a
bourgeoi s;
then
with
somebody
who
was
supp osed
to
be
hi s
friend,
who m
he
di d
favors,
let
hi m
als o
down.
It
was
rr
.
When
my
father
came
to
Vilna
,
he
was
walking,
he
walke d.
From
all
the
aggravation,
he
developed
a
very
bi g
abscess
right
he re
in
the
back .
He
went
to
the
hospital
and
when
it
came
the
ti me
of
li quidation
of
the
Jewish
population
and
everybody
was
sent,
we
were
actually
s
eparated.
I
went
to
the
g hetto
with
my
aunt
and
my
sister
and
my
father
was
already
in
the
ghe tto
because
th e
Jewish
hos pital
was
there.
He
wa s
desperate
because
he
wa s
operated
on
and
he
was
lying
in
bed
and
he
though t
that
he
lost
his
tw o
little
girls
an
d
his
sister
r
in
r
law.
Some how,
somebody
tha t
knew
us
ca m e
to
visit
hi m
in
the
hospita l
and
told
hi m
that
we
are
alive.
He
was
still
in
bad
shape
when
he
came
out
from
the
hospital
and
we
were
in
th e
ghe tto
toge ther.
After
he
got
a
littl e
bett er,
he
got
a
job
as
a
pharma
c
ist
in
a
rr
it
was
called
the
Spanish
lazareth,
the
pharmacy
and
he
worked
there
for
a
ti me.
Later
on,
it
was
li quid a ted
and
he
worked
in
the
hospital
pharmacy
in
g hetto.
I
was
sick
in
the
hospital
with
th e
infection
and
my
father
wa s
taken
out
by
the
Gestapo
in
his
white
coat,
from
th
e
pharmacy
with
another
gro up
of
people
from
the
hos pital
staff,
and
th ey
wer e
sent
to
a
labor
cam p
in
Eston ia.
Anthony :
You
remember
when
this
was?
Lily:
The
li quida tion
of
the
ghetto
was
in
Se ptember
in
194 3
and
this
wa
s
during
the
summer
in
19 43.
I
saw
once,
my
father,
later
on.
When
I
was
in
labor
camp,
Dünawerke,
it
was
nearby
of
Kaiserwald
[did
not
specify
whether
K a iserwald
ca mp
or
town
of
Kaise rwald,
now
Meza parks],
once
a
wo man
ca me
and
s a id,
you
kno w ,
I
met
somebody
who
says
he
is
David
Maz
u
r
and
he
was
crying
going
ar ound
there
looking
for
his
two
d a ughters,
li ttl e
girls.
I
said
that
I
know
you
beca use
when
we
had
a
very
bad
toothache,
from
the
la bor
camp
they
used
to
send
us
to
Kaiser wald,
to
this
German
de ntist,
and
she
had
a
very
bad
toothache.
Sh
e
went
an
d
she
me t
him.
I
really
don't
know
exactly
how
they
met
bu t
he
was
desperate.
When
he
hea r d
th ere

are
women
from
Vilna,
he
was
looking
for
us.
He
wa s
sent
from
Esto nia
to
this
conce ntratio n
ca mp,
Kaise rwald.
Anthony :
Kaiserwald,
where
you
go ?
Lily:
Yes,
we
go
Ka iserwald.
Th e
ne xt
day
I
went
and
I
pr etended
that
I
have
a
very
bad
toothache
and
I
went
to
K a iserwald.
I
risked
my
life
and
I
found
him
.
Before
I
went
there,
I
colle
cted
some
bre a d
and
I
brou ght
him
brea d.
When
I
saw
him,
I
didn 't
recognize
hi m.
He
was
w earing
the
striped
uniform
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
shr unk
and
I
mean
that
it
was
just
som ebody
that
was
not
my
father.
We
we
re
standi
ng
be hind
the
wall
be cause
women
and
men
were
not
supposed
to
rr
Jewish
women
and
men
were
not
supposed
to
co mmu nicate
even.
We
were
standi ng
and
he
asked
me
where
is
my
sister?
I
thi n k
it
was
th e
ti me
when
my
sister
was
very
sick
with
rheumatic
fever.
Th
is
was
the
re
ason
she
didn 't
come
and
she
was
in
a
small
like
a
rr
it
was
called
a
krankenrevie r,
in
this
labo r
camp .
I
said
tha t
she
wa s
all
right
and
that
she's
with
me
togeth er.
He
said,
look
after
we
will
survive,
I
want
you
to
co
me
to
the
pharma
cy
in
So
s
y
[Salos]
and
this
is
where
we
are
to
meet.
When
you
come
th e r e,
the
only
thing
I
ask
you,
you
should
bring
me
your
good
nam e.
I
un derstand
he
meant
tha t
he
wants
to
see
me
and
my
sister,
two
virgins,
he
mean t.
He
says
to
me,
I
don't
nee
d
so
mu ch
bread,
I
need
cigare ttes.
He
wanted
to
smoke.
Can
you
come
tomorrow
again?
I
came
back
and
I
asked
again
and
somehow
they
let
me
come.
I
remember
tha t
my
friends
there
that
worked
in
th e
labor
ca mp,
we
colle cted
war m
socks
and
gloves
and
also
got
some
tobacco
and
paper
and
I
was
so
happ
y
beca
use
when
we
were
working
in
the
labor
camp,
th ere
were
also
some
day
worker s.
They
asked
th em
for
th is
tobacco
and
they
gave
it
to
the m.
They
were
Latvian
day
workers,
and
also
pris oners
of
war
from
Holland.
Th
e
next
day
when
I
came
there
and
I
was
lo oking
for
him
but
he
wasn't
there .

Anthony :
You
don 't
kn ow
what
happened?

Lily:
I
don't
know
what
happened.
I
was
sea r ching
for
hi m
after
we
survived.
I
was
on
my
way
to
So
s
y
[Salos]
but
we
never
rr
.
It's
a
long
story,
we
never
got
there.
There
were
some
rumors
that
he
survived
and
tha
t
he
is
in
Russia
but
it
was
never
confirm ed.
I
could
never,
never,
.
So
actually
the
last
tim e
that
I
can
say
tha t
I
was
in
touch
with
my
father
wa
s
in
Kaiserwal d
con cen trati o n
cam p.

Anthony :
The
day
that
you
saw
him?

Lily:
 
That
I
saw.

Anthony :
Do
you
reme mber
the
date?
Lily:
We
arrived
in
Kaiserwald
s o metime
in
S epte mber.
It
must
have
be en
in
1943,
in
fall
of
1943,
yes.
Anthony :
Ironically,
he
was
acting
as
a
den tist?
Lily:
No,
he
wasn't
acting
rr
.

Anthony :
He
was
the
pharmacist
bu t
rr
?
Lily:
No,
no.
He
was
brought
fr om
Estonia
to
Kaiserwald.
He
was
not
acting
as
a
dentist.
I
was
brought
rr
.
Anthony :
You
were
pre tendi ng
to
be
rr
?
Lily:
No,
no.
I
was
rr
you
see
when
we
worked
in
th e
labor
cam p,
Düna werke,
when
we
had
a
very
bad
to
othache,
we
had
permission
to
go
to
visit
a
German
dentist
in
Kai
s erwald.
Anthony :
And
that 's
ho w
you
saw
yo ur
father?
Lily:
This
is
how
I
saw
because
I
escaped;
I
di dn't
go
to
the
den tist.
I
escaped
and
I
was
roaming
around
in
their
ca
mp
asking
ar
ound,
wher e
is
the
contingent
of
men
that
were
shipped
from
Eston ia
to
Kaiserwal d?
They
sho w
me
th e
pla ce
and
I
just
went
there
and
I
lo oked
for
my
father.
I
me t
him
there .

Anthony :
Was
he
s till
acting
as
a
pha rmacist
or
wa s
he
just
a
rr
?
Lily:
No,
no,
no.

Anthony :
Just
a
prisone r
in
a
uniform ?

Lily:
No,
no.
Th e
first
thi ng
tha t
they
stri ppe d
th e
professional,
Jewish
people
from
their
profession.
They
were
just
treate d
li ke
dirt,
like
labo rers,
like
slaves.
They
were
stripped
away
from
their
human
digni ty.
This
was
th e
first
thing,
was
to
break
th
eir
spirit.

Anthony :
So
after
he
le ft
the
ghetto,
he
was
no
lo nger
a
pharm acist?

Lily:
 
No,
he
was
not
a
phar macist;
he
was
just
a
simple
slave,
doing
slave
work.
.

Anthony :
Now
your
sto ry,
I'm
very
fa miliar
with
yo ur
story
and
with
your
sister's
story
as
well.
Are
th
ere
any
major
differe nces
between
your
sister's
story
and
yours
after
rr
?

Lily:
We
were
always
together .
I
think
we
survived
be cause
we
were
together .
We
helped
each
other.
During
the
incarcerations
time,
I
was
th e
one
that
was
helping
her.
Af ter
liberation,
when
I
was
very
sick,
she
recovered
sooner
and
she
was
rr
kind
of
took
over
and
she
be
came
the
older
sister.
But
I
think
that
be cause
we
wer e
toge ther,
it
gave
us
strength
and
this
he lped
us
a
lot,
too,
to
survive.
Anthony :
You
coul d
giv e
each
other
moral
suppor t
and
also
ph ysical
suppor
t?
Lily:
Physical
supp
ort
is
kin d
of
rr
we
were
looking
out
for
each
other.
There
was
the
loneliness
and
abandonment
rr
is
a
very
big
moral
deterrent.
We
ki nd
of
stuck
to gether .
At
ni ght,
when
we
slept,
we
were
always
togeth er
so
this
ki nd
of
gave
us
strength.

Anthony :
So
other
than
when
you
were
sick,
you
were
never
separated?
Lily:
No.
My
sister
had
a
very
hard
tim e
in
g hetto
be cause
she
was
the r e,
she
was
a
little
girl,
and
she
was
very,
very
hun gry,
very
und ernouri s hed.
She
di dn't
have
her
friends,
she
did n't
know
what
to
do
with
herself
;
she
was
mostly
spending
that
tim
e
wai ting
for
me
or
my
aunt
or
my
father
to
come
back
and
bri ng
her
something
to
eat.
My
sister,
even
now,
is
very,
very
de pressed.
She
is
un der
a
psychiatrist's
ca re
be cause
she
suffers
very
strong
bou ts
of
depression.
She 's
always
admiring
me
that
I
remember
so
well
be
cause
she
doesn't
re
member.
She
just
simply
does
not
re memb er
things.
I
don't
know
if
it's
she
block ed
it
out
or
it
was
intentional
but
when
she
needs
something
what
hap pen e d,
she
has
to
ask
me.

Anthony :
You
be came
like
her
moth er?

Lily:
Yes,
I
assumed
th
e
role
of
her
mother
after
liberation.
Even
toda y
I
ki nd
of
ha ve
the
mother
role .
I
never
thought
that
we
will
be
separated
bu t
she
is
now
in
Argentina.
But
ima gine,
she
was
born
in
1928,
so
in
1939,
she
was
just
elev en
years
old.
The
whole
world
crum
bled
around
her
and
sh
e
was
just
rr
.
I
was
never
a
teena ger
also
but
she
was
neve r
even
a
child
and
a
tee nag er,
so
many
lost
years
from
1939
to
1945,
six
years
lost.

Anthony :
She
had
hard ly
any
schooling,
two
years?
Lily:
She
hardly
ha d
any
s chool,
yes.
Sh
e
was
always
very
much
alive
an
d
there
was
no
joy
in
her
life.
I
mean
it
was
just
misery
and
misery
and
hunger
and
cold.
It
was
six
years
of
indescri bable
suffering,
moral
and
physical.

Anthony :
Just
the
movi ng
around,
ev en
if
the
other
horrors
hadn't
occurred.
Just
th
e
moving
around
and
the
loss
rr
.
Lily:
 
Uprooting,
uprooting.
Anthony :
That's
ri ght
rr
would
have
been
traumati c.
Lily:
 
That's
ri ght,
she
lost
ev erything.

Anthony :
She
lost
her
mother,
and
then
she
lost,
in
a
sense,
her
aunt/step mother.

Lily:
Yes,
she
lost
her
father,
she
lost
her
ho use,
she
lost
her
friends,
she
lost
her
school,
she
lost
her
balle
t,
I
mean
the
piano
lessons.
Everythi
ng
that
is
important
rr
her
little
friends,
every thing
that
is
important.
Anthony :
Then
from
time
to
ti me,
she
almost
lost
you?
Lily:
 
Oh,
yes.

Anthony :
That
must
ha ve
bee n
frightening?

Lily:
 
Yes,
very
much.
Anthony :
But
you
were
liberate d
and
you
survive d.
At
the
end
of
the
war,
you

some
attem pt

we
will

out
from

There
is
no
point
for
us
to
go
there.
We

I

She

We

Anthony :

He

Anthony :
There 's

Ver y

anything
else
that
we
forgot,
eit
h
er
today
or
in
the
last
interview
tha t
you
would
like
to
add?

Lily:
I
really
don 't
know.
Ther e
are
so
many
things
that
you
can
talk
about.
You
can
talk
for
days
and
day s .
There's
r e ally
no
end.

Anthony :
Your
testi mo ny
is
de
tailed.

Lily:
Yes,
it
is.
I
think
the
testi mony
that
th ere
were
songs
composed .
Anthony :
Yes
and
th e
poem.
Lily:
 
The
poem,
the
songs
com posed.
I
want
it
to
be,
this
is
a
very
important
part
that
rr
.

Anthony :
They'll
ne ed
someone
who
can
write
it
and
listen
to
it
rr
transcribe
it
beca
use
I
no
tice
those
lines
were
left
blan k
on
the
transcript
tha t
you
intervie wed.

Lily:
It
would
be
nice
if
somebo dy
coul d
rr
be cause
I
sang
th ose
things
so
it
would
be
ni ce
if
they
would
tr anscribe
it.
Anthony :
Apparently
whoever
did
th e
transcri ptio n
only
knew
English
so
it
was
left
bla
n
k.

Lily:
 
Oh,
you
mea n
th e
words.
Anthony :
Yes,
the
words
are
in
 r
?
Lily:
 
Yidd ish.

Anthony :
Yiddish,
yes.
But
I'm
sure
they
will
be
tr anscribed.

Lily:
 
I
heard
tha t
you
have
a
mu sical
depar tm ent.

Anthony :
Yes,
yes.
Lily:
 
I
thi nk
it
would
be
good
if
they
would
tr anscribe
it.
Anthony
:
Yes,
yes.
In
fact,
I
can
say
this.
Some
of
the
songs
are
bei ng
collected
and
I
think
that,
without
having
heard
yours,
yours
should
be
included.
Several
other
songs,
I
know,
have
bee n
recorded
and
passed
on
with
th e
words.

Lily:
They
should
be
included
because
this
is
a
very
im
portant
part.
So me
of
the
songs,
I
saw
the
ﬁtriptychﬂ
[?]
(470 )
of
the
life
and
the
hopes
rr
.
Af ter
all,
we
were
very
young
at
this
ti me,
it
should
be
in clude d,
and
it™s
a
very
important
part.
Anthony :
Do
you
listen
to
NPR,
All
Th ings
Con sid er ed
?
NPR

All

gs
Co nsi dered

WNYC?
Lily:
 
No.

Anthony :
There
was
a
program
a
few
months
ago
which
summarized
and
played
excerpts
from
a
recording
that
the
muse um
produce d .
Ghe tto
songs.

Lily:
 
Oh,
I
did n't
know
that .

Anthony :
Includi ng,
I
r ecall,
including
from
Vilna.

Lily:
Oh,
yeah?
I
d idn't
know
that.
Anthony :
Yes,
yes.
I
know
that
now
they'r e
on
sale.
They
have
audio
and
co mpac t
dis cs,
recordings.
What
I
should
do
is,
as
so on
as
our
interview
is
co mplete,
I
should
tak e
down
the
name
of
the
song
and
then
put
you
in
to
uch
or
pu
 t
th e
woman
who's
in
charge
of
th e
musi c
in
tou ch
with
you.

Lily:
I
gave
th em
the
songs
and
everything.
I
gave
th em.
I
have
someplace
rr
I
have
copies
here.
I
would
be
more
tha n
pleased
to
give
it
to
you
because
this
is
a
very
important
part
and
I
thi
nk
it
should
be
in
clude d,
it
should
docu mented.
I
do n't
want
it
to
be
lost
because
this
is
the
homage
of
those
people
in
those
difficult
cir cu m stances,
still
have
the
spirit
to
compose
and
to
write,
and
beautiful ly
write.

Anthony :
And
then
sing
it?
Lily:
 
Sing
it,
yes.
We
were
sing ing.

Anthony :
Thank
you
very
mu ch.

Lily:
 
You
are
welcome.
