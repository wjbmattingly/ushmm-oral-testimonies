Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: I™d like you to just begi
n by introducing yourself, and -- and telling us where and when 
you were born. 
Answer: My name  is Max Heller. I was born 
in Vi enna, Austria, in 1919. I come  from a 
relatively small fa mily, just a sister, and of c
ourse my parents. I grew up in a very Orthodox 
home . My parents observed the Shabbas, they 
would not work on the Sabbath; in fact, they 
would not even light -- put the 
light on. In fact, what -- that
 sort of gives me  wonderful 
me mories. My father was more Orthodox than -- 
than my mother. My father had the philosophy 

that God takes care of everything, 
and my mother said God takes ca
re of those who take care of 
themselves. So I™m sort of an in-between. If I 
lean to anything I lean 
to, you must take care of 
yourself rather than -- an
d my father would run across the st
reet against the light because he 
knew God would take care of him. 
But it™s interesting, that kind of
 faith helped us when things 
got very bad. Our home  was a very happy home.
 We were not wealthy by any means, I would 
say we were mi ddle income  people, both my moth
er and my father worked. They had their own 
business, which was a --  a textile 
business, but they sold to indivi
duals on a credit basis, and they 
had several salesmen that went out
 and sold the me rchandise and that  sort of thing. I -- as I told 
you, I was brought up Orthodox. In fact, I had a Hebr
ew teacher from the time I was eight years 
old to prepare me  for -- for my Bar Mitzva
h, he came to my house three times a week. I 
reme mber that teacher, because he taught me a lot,
 not just the Hebrew part, but also, after the 
lesson he would sit with me and talk to me a
bout what Judaism is all about, the ethics, the 
morals, and the stories, and I was fascinated w
ith that. And I would say 
that today I™m a strong 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395

Jew, more on the side of the morals and the et
hics, and how you™re supposed to behave, than the 
rituals. I -- I have nothing against 
rituals, I -- I observe but not -- no
t as much as I -- I try to live 
like this ma n taught me , so I™m -- I™m trying to gi
ve you a picture of what life was like in our 
house. My sister was two years old than I am. Sh
e -- she probably did no
t experience things the 
way I did because as a youngster I was involve d 
in a lot of fights because I was Jewish. I 
experienced a lot more anti-Semitism than my sister
 did. So it --  in that respect, perhaps we grew 

up a little bit different. 

Q: Why would you have experien
ced more than your sister? 
A: Well, my  sister , if ther e was any --  any anti-Semitic action on the street, she certainly would 

run home rather than get out and fight. So -- so 
it was a -- really differe
nt, she was not exposed 
as much as -- as I was. And I -- I -- you know, I-I 
sort of lived through it. I belonged to -- when I 
got older I belonged to a sport 
club called Ha-Koah, the word stands for strength, and I was in 
the wrestling section. So all of 
these guys -- I was like a ma scot. In
 those days they were really 
national champs. They didn™t shy away from 
defe nding yourself. And it™s interesting when I 
think about it now, is what ma de my Judaism st
ronger then, and still is today is you cannot shy 
away. You must face, you must f
ace anti-Semitism, if it exists. You -- you cannot just walk away 
from it. And even today when I see something th
at I feel -- and I™ve been
 in company of people 
that say things like, oh, I Jewed him down, as 
an example. I speak up. And perhaps this goes 
back to my childhood when I was -- 
I spoke up, and I defended myself. 
Q: But what at that point gave you the strength to defend yoursel -- yourself, instead of to -- 

A: We ll, I -- th-that™s a very good question. You 
know, people say I™m proud to be a Jew, right?  
That™s -- but you have to know why you are pr
oud, and I think because of my upbringing, both 

my mother and father, and then this teacher th
at I™m talking about, I felt good being Jewish. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395

never -- I never had to shy away, it was some thi
ng that I was very proud of, but I knew why. And 
so this, I think, ma de the diffe
rence, it™s the upbringi
ng that ma kes the difference. I was very 
happy. Even today I have people that -- I live in a sm
all town in the south, and we have a college 
in our town called Bob Jones University, and th
ey always send people out trying to convert you. 
They knock on my door. And both Trude, my wife 
and I, when we answer the door, we  say, you 
have the wrong address. We  are very happy with 
what we are. Maybe you™re happy with what 
you are. And so this -- you know, it carries forw
ard, there™s no question about it. And we -- I 
think our children f
eel the same way. 
Q: Let™s go back. You were talking about the 
fact that your family was very observant. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Do you have fond me mories of
 some  of those observances? 
A: Probably the happiest time of 
my life, this ma y sound ridiculous, when we were the poorest. 

And this was during the depression, I -- in Europe 
the depression started pe
rhaps a little earlier 
than it did in the United States. But my parent
s had practically lost  th
eir business. And they 
refused to go into bankruptcy. And so we had to
 give up our apartment, and we move d into one 
room. My sister, myself, my mother and father, 
and occasiona lly my mot her™s si ster. And on the 

Sabbath, in this one room, when during the day we
 would not light -- there was no light, the most 
beautiful time  was whe n later in
 the afternoon -- we went to synagogue in the morning, but later 
in the afternoon we would 
crawl in bed with Mother and Father
, and my father would tell these 
stories about he served four year
s in the war -- in -- on the side 
of Ger many, incidentally. But my 
mother would sing the most beautiful
 Jewish songs, and most of them are very sad, but they were 
beautiful. And we -- my -- we used to si -- we 
we re lying in bed cryi
ng, not because we were 
unhappy, because we were happy. And I™ve learne d a lot from that. I -- I™ve learned to become  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
4 
 
really sentimental about my -- my Yiddish [indeci
pherable] and to appreci
ate li -- really life, 
because the songs deal with life. 
So I would say i-if you say what gave it to me , and what -- what 
my life was like, this I think determined the way 
I am. Those t i me s. I reme mber at the end of the 
day on the Sa bbath, they turned the lights on, and 
they would sit down at 
a table and they would 
divide the money they had earned -- they went to
 work for other people, and they divided the 
money that they had to pay the creditors. And when
 things got better, my mother and father were 
able to get back into business. My father wa
s very proud of the name
, he wouldn™t think of 
bankruptcy. And again, that I thi
nk taught me  a great deal. So th
ese were -- these were happy 
times, although they were tough times. 
Q: Tell me about the Jewish lif
e in Vienna in general.  
A: We ll, Jewish people were a
bout 10 percent of the population. A
nd it was a very rich life. The 
Jews were involved in -- in the music, they were
 involved in -- in polit
ics, they were involved 
certainly in the arts and sciences, and in te
aching. And Jews, genera
lly speaking, I would say, 
were quite influential. They were also -- not all 
of them were successful, but they were mostly 
successful people, and -- and very law abiding. 
We didn™t -- we had nobody to be ashame d of. So 
Jewish life was a rich life, I w
ould say, although I must tell you, sa
 -- when -- I go back now to -- 
to this sa --  during the day on Saturday, the thing 
that really touched me  is my mother would tell 

us stories about her life as a teen
ager in a little town in Pola
nd. She grew up in a town called 
Lubachow. Her parent s, I would say, were poor 
people. Very, very observant. I still reme mber 
my grandfather, very much so because  he was a ve ry imposing ma n with a white beard, and -- 

but he always would tell me  these stories, and my
 mother would tell us wh
at happened to her as a 
child. She was sent away from home when she wa
s not even 10 years old because the fear that 
they had of pogroms, when soldiers would come  a
nd rape girls. They -- she and her sisters would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395

hide under the house. And so one day they were sent
 to -- to Kraków to a -- to a me mber of the 
fa mily, and my mother, at age 10 or so, had to 
work for that fa mily, although she lived with 
them. She was like a -- she took care of the baby, 
she helped clean the house. So when you hear 
from your own mother what -- what she went th
rough -- but my mother wa
s never bitter. The -- 
the thing that my mother always said, but look, he
re we are. And thank God we are alive. I -- I 
survived that. So these are -- th
ese are all part of my -- my ma
ke-up, and it was very meaningful 
to me  to hear what my parents went through. My fa
ther went -- was in the service for four years 
as I told you, he was wounded in the war. And yet,
 when Hitler came , it ma de absolutely no -- no 
difference. Neither my mother 
nor my father went to public 
school because the public school 
would not have them. And both my parents were
 self educated, and went in business self 
educated. So as a result of that, education was th
e most important thing in
 our fa mily. So it -- it 
all come s back. You know, people say, well, the Jewi
sh people are so intent on education. This is 

a good reason. That™s why. And my
 mother would even write in her -- she -- she some times 
would keep a journal, which we found only recentl
y, and it was very touching what she said. She 
says, one day I had -- I prayed that my child
ren would have a good edu
cation. It™s the most 
important thing in the world. So -- so perhaps th
is gives you a -- a picture of what -- what it was 
like, life for me  in our house, and generally life
 in Vienna. But we had good times in Vienna, too, 
we used to -- we used to go to balls, and -- 
during Mardi Gras season. In
 fact, every summer we 
would have a house in the countr
y, and that™s where I me t my  -- my wife, when I was -- I was 17 
and she was 14. And the day I me t her I told he
r I was going to marry 
her, and her father 
overheard it, and I was not his favorite person 
after that. She was -- she was the only child. 
Q: You spoke of education. I was wondering if you 
could talk a little bitabout that, and whether 
you went to integrated schools -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
6 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: -- or whether you went onl
y to Jewish institutions? 
A: Yeah. No, I went -- when my -- my gramma r 
s c hool was boys only, and that™s not unusual, it 
was a public school. I went to grammar school for f
our years, it was totally integrated. We had -- 
in fact I had ma ny non-J e wish friends when I went 
to school. And then afte
r -- at age 10 is when 
I finished grammar school, and stood an exam 
to enter into a private high school called 
gymnasium.  And that too was integrated. We  ha
d religion -- we took re
ligion in school in 
contrast to America, and this
 is -- that™s one reason why I 
feel so strong about not mi xing 
religion with the state, because we -- when we 
went to school, we had religion, but we had to 
leave our room, and we went to 
Jewish class, so to speak, when
 others went to the Christian 
class. That was not very good, but -- but the sc
hool was integr ated. I experienced anti-Semitism 
then, where you know, you™d find scribbled notes, 
you Jew, or Jew go back to Palestine, and 
things like that. Some  of the professors we 
had, I felt were anti-Semitic. Maybe it™s because I 
didn't study that much, but some  of t hem, on the 
other hand, I felt were very sympathetic. So my 
schooling -- I finished school not 
because I was genius, but the sy
stem wa s that you can finish 
high school after four years, and I went to work 
as an apprentice. And I made the equivalent of 
ma ybe 20 dollars a month. And while I, however
, while I was working I went to a business 
school for three years. And while I wa s not 
a very good student in the gymnasium, business 
school was really what I wanted, 
and I -- I -- I did quite well. So 
I worked and went to school at 
the same time. 
Q: And wha t  was the work? 

A: I -- the sc -- the business that  I worked for,
 they had five and 10 cent stores which they 

started, and in fact they were among the fi
rst. And they also w
ould sell merchandise on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
7 
 
consignment and put people in business. And my
 work when I first st
arted was sweeping floors 
and cleaning bathrooms and that sort of thing, but 
within -- when I was 17, 
I was in charge of a 
department and I had learned about import/export,
 because a lot of the merchandise which we 
sold was imported. And I had taken all kinds of 
courses which enabled me  to become  a buyer for 
-- for that company. And a good ma ny of the peopl
e that worked -- the company was owned by a 
Jewish ma n, and the people that worked ther
e were both Jews and non-Jews. And I must tell you 
this, we haven™t come to Hitler yet, but Hitler came in on a -- on a Friday, on, I believe it was 
March the 11
th
. On Monday I went to work, we didn™t know what to do, so you go, like you 
always go, I went to work. And the same  people th
at I had worked with for several years already 
-- this was 1937 -- is when -- ™38, excuse me, 
when Hitler came. The same people that I had 
worked with for several years suddenly appeared 
in Nazi uniforms with
 the swastika band. The 
same  people that I had lunch with every day, that I -- that I went out with, the very same  people. 

And that was a shock. And this -- this just te
lls you really, what went
 on, and how -- how life 
was. In a way we kidded ourselves. We -- we 
kidded. Although we had all of these fights and 
troubles, but never thought that 
it would get to a point as it di
d. What also happened is a ma n 
who worked for the owner of our company, that our
 owner had put in business, came  in one day 
and took over the business. Came  
in with a group of Nazis in bl
ack and brown uniforms and just 
took the business. And ironically ma de out a r
eceipt, and fired everybody
, except three of us. 
And we were put into one office, in one room, an
d we -- and the reason they didn™t fire us is the 
people they put in charge had to learn some thing. 
So I™m -- I™m trying to really give you a picture 
of -- it™s -- it™s -- it
™s -- when I think about it, I™m rea
lly amazed myself of how we were so 
foolish prior to Hitler not to r
ecognize, or not to sense that ther
e was more to this than just 
having a fight in the street.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395

Q: Let™s just backtrack, cause of course I -- I 
want you to tell me  muchmore about when Hitler 
came in. You me ntioned that there 
we re fights in the s -- in the 
street, or scribbled notes. Can you 
talk a little bit more about othe
r hints, or -- or  outright incident
s of anti-Semitism prior to Hitler? 
A: We ll, of course the Nazi pa
rty had started ma ny, ma ny years a
go. And in fact, they killed a 
chancellor, his name was Dollfuss, several years 
before Hitler came into Austria. But it was after 
1933, where Hitler came into Germany, where he took over the German governme nt. And those 
people, his followers, killed Dollfuss, and they were
 put in jail. So there 
was always that unrest, 
and there was always -- Austria 
had ma ybe 10 - 15 political partie
s, and there were ma rches in 
the streets. It™s -- it™s quite diffe
rent than it is here. And it always 
resulted in -- in fights and even 
killings. There was -- the anti-Semitism that you 
could feel in Austria was that some time s you 
could not live where you wanted to live. You we
re rejected on a job because you were Jewish. 
So it -- it wa -- it wa -- those ki
nd of things. But we lived with 
it, and this was -- you almost get 
used to a way of life, that™s 
just the way it was. And so you 
-- you live with it. When people 
came -- we had somebody in the pl ace where I 
worked who had come  fr om Ger many, from 
Leipzig and he told us stories about that Jewi
sh businesses were taken over, and Jews were 
beaten and all that. I must te
ll you the truth, we didn™t believe 
it. We  thought oh, there must be 
some thing wrong with that ma n. Why would th
ey do anything like that? So there was a 
difference between political national socialism and the anti-Semitic part of anti -- o- of that 

fascism. It was either  political , but it was also 
anti-Semitic. So it was in that at mosphere that we 
grew up. Maybe I felt it more than others becaus
e I was in a Jewish club, and ma ybe because of 
the section where I lived. Maybe I 
was more aware of it because of
 the education that I had. And 
my mother, the stor ies that she would tell me, I -- 
I was sort of on the -- I -- I had like an antenna. 
You -- you get sensitive where you --
 where you feel these things. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
9 
 
Q: We re you beaten up? 
A: I was beaten up and I beat up. I did it both ways
. Oh definitely. I -- I came  home  s o me times 
with a bloody nose. But I also came home  wher
e I felt very triumphant
, where I gave some body 
a bloody nose. 

Q: But none of this taunting -- wa
s that disturbing to you, or th
at surprising to you?  Didn™t you 
come  home  and -- and talk to your fa
mily and say why is this happening? 
A: No, not really, because I knew the histor y of 
the Jews. Not only my mother™s experience in 
Poland, but I knew about the Spanish Inquisition.
 I knew what happened in Europe, in ma ny 
countries where Jews lived, and then came another 
king or another prince or another chancellor, 
and Jews had to leave. I knew all that. I had -- 
I had heard stories from my grandfather in Poland, 
who told me  what -- what he had experienced. So
 this -- you know, this was the history of the 
Jews. I accepted that. That was the wa y life was, 
and -- and the more -- the more they -- the more 
they were after us, the stronger we became, I felt,
 at least. It™s like when you -- when you hunt an 
animal, the fox become s very fast and clever, be
cause it hunted in -- in a way, that™s the way it 
was, certainly with me . 

Q: Now you went to public schools or pr
ivate schools, but they were mi xed. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: We re your friends mixed, or
 were your friends Jewish? 
A: Most of my friends were Jewish, but some  of them, of course, were not. And one of the bad 

experiences I had after Hitler came was with a 
friend, a non-Jewish friend
 that I had known for 
ma ny, many years, who in fact belonged to the 
same  club, the sport club that I belonged to. And 
he is the one that threw me  on 
the street, and ma de me  scrub the street. And when I wanted to 
pull my pants up not to make -- make them wet, he -- he pulled them down, and he called me a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
10 
 
[indecipherable] a pig Jew. That was perhaps 
the greatest shock. Can you imagine that you -- you 
sort of grew up with somebody a
nd suddenly this is what happen
s to you. You really feel, when 
some thing like that ha ppens, you feel it perhaps 
more because of the disappointme nt, because it™s 
some thing I did not expect. Fighting on the stre
et I -- I expected. You 
know, that -- it really 
didn™t bother me . But this was a betrayal, I was 
betrayed. So when you ask me  about friends, I™m 
not saying that every one was like 
that. Most of my non-Jewish fr
iends would not have anything 
to do with me after that. That -- a
nd this, in a way, I -- I expected 
that . I -- I -- I just  -- they were 
protecting themselves, and at that point I wasmu ch more interested with what was going to 
happen to us, could we get out, than
 if some body spoke to me  or not. 
Q: But it mu st have been tremendously hurtful. 

A: Oh, it was very hurtful, it was very hurtful. 
One time I was surrounded by a group of people -- 
when I went to this school I was telling you 
about, th-the business sc
hool while I was working, 
and one time I was surrounded by ma ybe 10 or  15 pe
ople my age that I had gone to school with, 
who threatened to beat me  up. 
And if it hadn™t been 
for a police officer -- and that was unusual 
by the way, that a police officer would interfere,
 because normally they looked aside, I would 
have been beaten to a pulp, I™m sure. It wa
s hurtful. Th-There™s no question about it. But you 

know, it just didn™t get me  down. Th
is is where my father™s faith come s in. I knew that some  -- 
we -- we had to get out, there was no question 
about that, and we did 
not go to pieces. It™s 
interesting, with all the 
troubles, Jewish people would still tell 
jokes. Whe n -- when all these -- 
these bad things happened, they would still tell jokes. They woul
d still talk about norma l life. 
You don™t just give up everythi
ng. That™s the way life was, you -- you went on, you tried to do -- 
live as normal as you could, which really wasn™t
 normal. Because I reme mber my mother and 
father had -- or everything they had, their bank ac
count was confiscated afte
r Hitler, and we lived 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
11 
 
from what my mother had saved -- and I 
often tell Trude I hope
 you have some  money 
some where I don™t know about. And after awhile wh
en that ran out, we began to sell, like my 
mother liked silver  and things like that. And this
 is what we lived from. My mother ma de -- I -- 
every day we  ate like potatoes. Meat was hardly
 ever, but never complained. We  never -- we 
never complained about it. So I 
-- I don™t know how others reacte
d. We  were glad that we -- we 
were still alive, we were hopeful 
that we would get out, and of c
ourse we -- we -- we did get out. 
I -- I -- I don™t want to ta
lk about the beatings that people took
, and what we saw on the street. It 
is indescribable in a way. It™s 
-- it™s unbelievable that this happened to people that  confessed to 
be God fearing -- I mean that peop
le who -- who said they believe 
in God, went to church, went 
to concert, loved music, loved literature, that thes
e are the very same people that  turned into -- to 
beasts, and then came home  and loved and hugge
d their children. So it was a tough time.  
Q: This probably does take us up to, you 
know, what happened in March of -- of 1938. 

A: Mm-h m.  
Q: Because you -- you™ve  me ntioned that you knew a little bit of what was going on in Germany, 
but you didn™t either believe it or -- 

A: We  -- we did not -- we knew a little bit, 
we did not know everything, of course. And also you 
have to remember during those years there were
 not -- the concentrati
on camps had not started 
yet. Businesses were confiscated, laws were pa
ssed in Germany that for 
inst ance a Jewish doctor 
could -- did not cre -- treat a non-
Jewish patient and the other 
way around. That Jews could not 
employ non-Jews, etcetera. Those -- those were the 
laws that were passed,
 but there were no -- 
no concentration camps yet. There wa s always
 a rumbling going on, and Hitler proposed that 

Austria be annexed to Germany. And a boat wa
s to be taken, I believe it was on the 13
th
 of 
March, 1938. The chancellor, the Austrian chance
llor at that time, his na me was Schuschnigg 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
12 
 
went to Berchtesgaden two or th
ree days before the vote was take
n -- or to be taken and told 
Hitler that  we™re fighting it, we™re not -- we™re not
 going to just  accept this, and so forth. Well, 
on Friday before election, I was outside of the busin
ess, I had been at a meeting, and it was in the 
afternoon. And of course there was 
a lot of literature about how to
 vote, vote yes or vote no and 
that sort of thing, but you didn™
t see any swastikas. A
nd in the afternoon, with
in one hour, word 
got out that Hitler™s troops had marched into 
Aust ria, and I have never se en a people more 
organized than the Austrians were. Police offi
cers put on swastika bands,public buildings flew 
the -- the -- the swastika flag. The trucks were al
ready out in the street  looting. And this all 
happened within -- within an hour. It was hi
ghly organized, and I must tell you, Austria was 
really not taken over, because Austria was happy 
to become  part of Germany. The people were 
jubilant, they were absolutely j
ubilant. They were not victims, 
the Austrians were not victims. 
They were pa rt of it. And I -- I reme mber th
is wa s on a Friday and I went home i mme diately, 

came home , and I said, what are we going to do?  A
nd my mother said,ﬁIt™s 
Shabbas, it™s Friday 
night. We ™re gonna have a -- we gonna have Sabbath.ﬂ
 And believe it or not,
 we sat down at the 
table -- Friday was a -- was a w
onderful day in our home, e veryt
hing was cleaner, it smelled 
more -- better. It was really like a festival . My 
mother said this is Shabbas, we™re going to sit 

down, we™re going to have our meal. She lit the ca
ndles, she prayed over the candl es, we had our 

meal, my father saidtheprayers. 
And then, after that is when we r
eally began to talk. But this --  
that -- the -- the ritual  of the Friday night se
rvice remained, in fact 
it probably was the most 
meaningful Friday night we ever spent. There wa
s great strength there, 
and great faith. We ll, 
now I must tell you what happened. I™ll go back a lit
tle. In 1937, on -- this is
 when we went to 
the country in the summe r  and rented a house. I met my wife, I  told you about that. I 

immediately fell in love with her. But the week 
when I me t her, for some  unexplainable reason -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
13 
 
my father would commute and he would come  in
 on a Friday and stay til Monday. On Thursday, 
I cannot tell you why, I™ll never kno
w why, I decided to go to Vienna and come  back on Friday 
with my father. And everybody said, why you going, 
you just me t Trude, and I said, I just feel 
like going. And when I got off the railroad stati
on in Vienna, I me t a boy friend of mi ne. And he 
said, what are you doing this evening?  And I said
, I really have no plans, I don™t even know why 
I came. He said, why don™t go we -- why don™t we go dancing. And so I met him that evening 

and we went to an outdoor restaurant where th
ere were -- where there was dancing. And I -- in -- 
in Europe it is quite appropriate
 that you can get up from your table,
 walk over to -- to a lady and 
ask her to dance, and if she says no, you -- 
you know, you™re a little 
embarrassed, but you go 
back to your table. So I had notic
ed a table with a -- it was obvi
ous that they were Americans. 
There were fi ve girls and a chaperone. And I sa
id to my friend, I says, you know this -- this -- 
there™s one girl there, I really
 like her looks and I™m going to as
k her to dance with me . If she 
says no, I™m going to walk out, cause I™m not 
going to come  back to the table and be 
embarrassed. So I paid my bill and I walked over, and in German -- I couldn™t speak English, I 

asked the chaperone, ma y I dance with one of th
e girls, and they looked me over, and they 
agreed, and I asked this girl to dance with me
. And we danced until the place closed, about one 
o™clock. And then I asked the chaperone, ma y I come  the next day on Friday and take this young 

lady for a walk and show her Vienna, and they -- 
after a conference they agreed. And so the next 

day I -- I bought a little 
dictionary, and I picked her up at the 
hotel and we  ma de -- we walked for 
about two hours, ma de conversati
on through this dictiona
ry. I took her back to the hotel, and she 
by the way was -- she had just graduated high school, 
so she was just about my age . I said, give 
me  your na me  and address, and I will learn how to
 speak English and then I will write to you. So 
she gave me  her name  and address, and her na
me  was Mary Mills, she lived on Mills Avenue, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
14 
 
Greenville, South Carolina, U.S.A. And I took th
at address and I put it in my wallet. Then on 
Friday evening I came back to the summer resort
 and I told Trude, ﬁGue
ss what, I danced with 
an American.ﬂ And Trude says, ﬁI could care less
.ﬂ She wasn™t too impressed. Well, I saved that 
address, and now go back -- I go forward, Friday night
 after si -- after we had our meal, I said to 
my parents, ﬁYou know, you reme mber I me t this girl 
in -- in fisil -- in 
Vienna, after I had come  
back fr om the summer resort? I have her addre
ss, I™m going to write to her and see if she will 
help me.ﬂ And my parents said, ﬁShe™ll never re
me mber you.ﬂ I says, ﬁWell, we™ll see.ﬂ In fact, I 
told that to -- to Trude, my -- now my wife, 
and she said, ﬁGood luck and good weather.ﬂ I wrote 
to her and I still have a 
copy of that letter. I reme mber I wrote the letter in German a nd then I 
took each word and translated it to English so 
the -- the gr ammar is not good. But she -- the letter 
I wrote to Mary Mills, she understood what I wa
s saying. And I -- I said 
to her in the letter, 
perhaps you will reme mb er me. I must get out of
 here. If you will help me, I promise you I™ll 
never be a burden to you. And that was in Ma
rch of 1938. And several we
eks went by and I did 
not hear from her, and one day -- I think I was with
 Trude at their store, 
if I™m not mistaken -- I 
get a call from my father, you have
 a registered letter from Ameri
ca. I cannot tell you what that 
felt like. Wh en I came home , and I opened up the le
tter, it said, I have not
 forgotten you. I have 
gone to see a ma n here in Greenville, who pr
omised that he would help you. His name  is 
Shepherd Saltzma n, he owns a shirt factory, and 
he said that he woul
d send you the necessary 
papers. There™s no way that I can tell you [indeciphera
ble] we were very lucky. And this is really 
how I came to America. This man he lped me. He 
later told me , he said, ﬁWhen Mary came to see 
me , I said to her, how can I not help, when I a 
Jew -- when you a Christian want to help, and I as 
a Jew, how can I not help? ﬂ  So he sent me  an af
fidavit that would guarantee that I would not be a 

burden to the governme nt. In the a
ffidavit he said, if there™s a
nybody else in your family that you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
15 
 
want to come with you, let me  know. We ll, we didn™t 
the chutzpah, the gall to -- to ask for more, 
but then when things got worse, and my sister 
had a very close call, frightening experience, we 
sent a telegram to this man and said, would you in
clude my sister Paula?  
And he wired back to 
the consulate to include her. And so my sister 
and I came here -- came to America in the end of 
July 1938, and left my parents behind. 
Q: I want to backtrack. I know that 
this is difficult to talk about,
 but I think what™s important for 
those of us who were not there to understand is
 -- is really the mood an
d the circumstances of 
Vienna after the Germans e
ssentially annexed Austria. 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: And wha t  -- what was going on. What you saw, what you experienced. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: How your life was changed. I think that™s really important. 

Q: Well, let me start off how my life was ch
anged, on -- on the out -- on the outside. How did -- 
how did we know that there was a difference. Th
e following week after Hitler ma rched in, the 
benches in the parks were already ma rked no Je
ws . No Jews allowed. That following week, Jews 

were dismissed from the i r job. That followingweek, some  synagogues were
 burning, stores were 
broken into. We saw trucks that 
took, especially groceries, out 
of stores. In our own case, our 
bank account was confiscated. The customers my
 parents had stopped paying. What I saw was 
neighbor turning against neighbor. If
 -- if some  people wanted to ha
ve a certain apartment, they 
would go to the -- to the governme nt and say so 
and so has said some thing about the Ge rman, 

and the result was that they had to move out of
 their apartment. And I™l
l give you an example, 
happened in -- in my wife™s case, Trude and her 
fa mily were ordered out of their apartment and 
given six hours to get out, and they ha d to fi
nd another pl ace. And that othe r place where they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
16 
 
lived was like a ghetto, really. 
But that™s how it happened. Ho
w was life otherwise? People 
disappeared, people were scared 
to death. When I heard anybody wa
lking in back of me, there 
was a fear. A fear I cannot explain. I reme mber 
one night, about 11 or 12 o™clock, there was a 
knock on our door, and our first thought was oh my 
God, the Gestapo is here. I open up the door, 
and it was a -- a ma n who said, I™m a  conductor, 
train conductor. I have
 an envelope for you 
from your fa mily in Poland. My father had family in Poland, and my mother had fami ly in 

Poland. And they™ve said to tell you to come  to 
Poland. And I said to this conductor, tell them 
they better ge t out of Poland. See, the people in
 Poland were in the same  position that we were 
about Germany. People in Poland th
ought this -- they™re going to be okay. We  already felt that 
there was no place in Europe for us. So life was 
-- people were already, as 
I told you -- we had a 
friend in our fa mily who was picked up by the Gest
apo, he wa s put into a baseme nt, and he wa -- 
with -- with a group of other Jews, and he was 
told, say your last pray
ers, we™re gonna -- you™re 
gonna be executed. And they did it 
in alphabetical order, they w
ould call. His name  was Lang, L-
a-n-g. They called people in alphabetical or der. In
 the -- in the -- in that baseme nt, people were 

already saying their Shema, hear oh Israel, the la
st prayer that you say before death. And when 
he came outside, they were shooting in the air 
and laughing, and then kicked him out. But in the 
meanti me, some people died of fear. I mean, it wa
s that kind of thing. And I reme mbe r  we used 

to stand in line at embassies, hoping to get -- 
there were always rumors. Oh, you can go to 
Australia, you can go to England. You can get a visa
 here or there. So we
 would stand all night, 
waiting to ge t into the embassy. And the young H
itler youth would come  in truc ks, and they 
would throw horse ma nure at us, and the police 
would stand there and laugh. So what -- what 
was life like, it was --  it -- it™s very hard to 
-- for people to understand how we even survived 
me ntally. And yet we -- we would -- we woul
d try to listen to th
e radio, although it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
17 
 
forbidden -- foreign -- foreign broadcast. And yet 
we -- during all that time we still hoped -- we 
said, oh well, maybe America is not going to allo
w this to happen, and maybe Russia will --  will 
do some thing. Maybe France will do some thi
ng. There was still that hope that some body was 
going to come  to our rescue. And you know what I 
learned? The world does not hear tears. You 
can cry, and cry, nobody hears you. The world does not
 hear you cry. And that™s exactly what 
happened. We were crying, but nob
ody was listening. So that™s -- 
that™s what 
life was like. 
Q: You continued to go to work? 
A: Until I -- but just for a few w
eeks. I still ha ve a copy of the letter, sa ying you™re disc harged, 
yeah. I worked, I think, until May. 

Q: And then they discharged you? 

A: Oh sure. They discharged me  within a week of
 -- after he took over, an
d gave me a letter -- I 
have a letter of recomme ndation, which is ridicul
ous, but -- what a good worker I was. But they 
discharged me , as of -- I™ve 
forgotten the date exactly. 
Q: So when you describe police or soldiers or
 Hitler youth, are we ta
lking about Germans or 
Austrians? 

A: Austrians more than Germans. It™s very in
teresting that -- that 
you ask me  that question, 
because I had some  narrow escapes where I wa
s saved by a German. I reme mber one time, 
Trude™s father had loved cars, and he had a br
and new car. And one day I came to her house and 
she said, ﬁThey came and got my father™s car. They
 just -- they gave us a receipt , they took the 
keys.ﬂ I says, ﬁThey can™t do that, how can they 
do this?ﬂ And like a fool I went to the Gestapo 
headquarters, and there hundreds of people were st
anding in line because they had been called to 

come  to the Gestapo, and I, like a schmoe stand th
ere, and suddenly a -- a -- a staff car, a German 
officer gets out of the car and he takes a look 
at me  and says , ﬁ Why are you here? ﬂ  And I tell him 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
18 
 
the story, he says, ﬁTake my advi
ce. Go home .ﬂ So this is -- th
is is one time  when -- when a 
German really -- a German officer helped me
. I had another experi
ence -- you know, you gotta 
have some  luck in life. People call 
it mi racle, luck, whatever it is. In 
order to cu --  to get the vi sa 
from the Americans, we had to have a paper fr
om the Austrian government saying that we had 
no -- commi tted no crime, and that sort of thing. My
 sister applied for it and I did, and hers came 
back and mi ne didn™t. And in the meantime I re
ceived a letter from the American embassy 
saying your papers are ready, but when you come  
be sure you have this and this and that. 
Included in that was the letter from the governme nt
 that I was not a criminal. And it wa s just two 
or three days before I was supposed to get my 
visa. And if you don™t have the papers, they pass 
you up. So I stood in line again for hours and hour
s with my mother, to 
this -- to the police 
station. I finally come  upstairs and this German, 
he says what do you want
, and I tell him what 
happened. And I plead with him, he says, I™m so
rry, there™s nothing I can do for you. It™ll take 
days and days and days to -- to search your r
ecord. And while I™m talking to him, a young girl 
walks up, and calls him aside, and they -- two of
 them look at me , and they whisper, and he 
come s back to me  and he says, if I ha ve your 
word that you will not tell this to anybody, come  
back this afternoon. This -- this young lady has agreed to spend the rest of the day just on your 

case. I come  downstairs and my mother said, wh
at happened, and I squeezed her arm,  which I 
tried to show her it™s good, because I was afra
id to say anyt hing in front of anybody. You know, 
you save your own skin. I come  back in the afternoon, he hands me  the papers and he said, I 

must tell you, he says, ﬁI™m a nationa le soci alis
t. I™m a national soci alist. I™m a political one. I 

never, never thought this would happen. I wish th
at I coul d go with you.ﬂ He says, ﬁAnd you will 
do well in America, and I wish you luck.ﬂ So 
I -- you -- you sort of -- you -- you -- you lived by 
your experiences, and what I have learned is, with
 all these terrible expe
riences that we  have, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
19 
 
there is some body good. And I live on the good experien
ces, rather than the bad ones. If I didn™t, 
I don™t think I could have survived me ntally. I 
could not. And so I grew up and I ma tured, and 
tried not to hate, because that -- 
hate eats you up, it doesn™t
 -- it doesn™t hurt 
the one you hate, it 
hurts -- it hurts you. For every badthat I had -- not for every, but 
look, I had a Christian girl save 
my life. I had these people that 
helped me . And the others, those 
that  -- the real  -- I -- I can™t 
even find a word for them, that behaved like they
 did, I -- I -- I -- I try to forget -- some body 
once asked me , have you forgiven?  And I said, that
 kind of crime requires 
a greater -- a greater 
force than what I am, to forgive. That is not up
 to me . They gonna have to answer to a greater 
being than -- than to me . And -- a
nd this is -- this is the way I f
eel, and this is true. I cannot -- I 
cannot -- nobody can imagine how these people acte
d. And I must tell you, they were overjoyed, 
the Austrians. They were overjoyed. I mean, here
 is Hitler promising -- 
don™t forget, 10 percent 
of Vienna™s population was Jewish, and -- and 
it was a -- basically a thriving community. And 
Hitler says to these people, you s
ee, all that they have, you will ha
ve. You can have it. Just take  
it. So they we re -- they we re -- they we re pro -- pro-Hitler. 
Q: When the Germans came in, were th
ere Germa n troops in the streets? 
A: Oh yes, yeah. They -- at first, in fact, my 
God, there was a parade. The German sol diers, they 

parading. He  -- they probably picked the -- the be
st looking ones, and th
e people were jubilant. 
Unfortunately, some of the churches welcomed 
Hitler, issued proclamation welcoming Hitler. 
Sure, there were -- there were German troops, but 
they didn™t have to stay there, because the 
Austrians we re very happy to do that. The Au
strian police was like -- 
was Hitler supporters, 
there™s no question about it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
20 
 
Q: Now in the early days, as I understand it, there 
was a lot of chaos, a lot of sort of uncontrolled 
violence. And from what  I™ve read, that after 
some time, and I don™t know how much time, that 
sort of the efficiency of the German machine 
dema nded that -- that that chaos be controlled. 
Q: We ll, they actually, y-y-you reme mber the story 
about Kristallnacht, a
nd I think that was in 
Nove mber of 1938, what the governme nt actually 
said, on this and this day, you can go out and 
do what you want. You go ahead, break -- break th
e -- the store windows, go ahead and beat up 
people. Go, do what you want, you™ve got 24 hours
 to do it. So it was the governme nt that 
controlled the chaos, you™re right
. But individuals, that doesn™t 
-- didn™t mean that individuals 
did not perform violence. But the governme nt contro
lled --  which was even worse than if it were 
just a riot on the part of pe
ople, cause by that time they alr
eady began to build concentration 
camps, and they had passed all these different 
laws. The Nuremberg Laws became  the Austrian 
laws. So that  -- it was a --  it was a very well organized effort.  
Q: I guess my question here is, how
 long did it take after March 13
th
 for things to settle down a 
little bit, and for the governme nt, German or Aust rian, 
to really take charge in a -- in a systematic 
way. 

A: We ll, I left Vienna in July, the end of Ju
ly 1938. By that time it was not systematic, it was 

still -- some  of it was systematic yes, if you want
ed to take over a business, if a -- if -- if a 
Austrian wanted to take your business, and they 
would have a friend who is a Nazi, they were so 
well organi zed that they gave you a receipt . Now, 
I™m not being facetious. So when I left there 
was still that -- that sort of th
ing going on. In fact, I would say, af
ter that is when it became more 
regulated. But that didn™t mean that you didn™t fear 
of your life. The differen
ce was that it wa -- 
the -- the uniform peopl e that cam
e, it was the Gestapo people w
ho came for you, rather than an 
individual ho-hoodlum, if that™s
 -- if that™s what you mean. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
21 
 
Q: Yeah, well, I -- I -- I mean, I 
can™t imagine that this massive 
violence and looting and beating 
that s -- that began imme diately, 
went on continuously for mo nths. 
A: No, no, n-no, you™re right, no. It -- it was still ther
e, but not -- not in the same  force. At first 
people were evidently told, do what you want. A
nd that was an outlet for them, I mean, they 
were so happy that Hitler came because now they could loot . Now, if they wanted our apartment, 
they got it. Now, if they wanted 
our business, they got it. Right?  So
 that was at first, and then, of 
course it became  more regulated because the 
governme nt stepped in and built the concentration 
camps, an-and that sort of thing. 

Q: But this cr a -- this real  crazines
s, did it last two weeks, two months? 
A: N-No, it lasted several weeks.
 It lasted several w
eeks. But the -- the fear did not leave us. 
Perhaps the fear was even greater because th
e -- because the government without a doubt, took 
over the vi olence, or cont rolled the violence. 

Q: And whe n you speak of the governme nt, 
I don™t mean to be [indecipherable] 
A: The Austrian governme nt, the Austrian governme
nt. But they had put in -- Germany put in a -
- a -- a -- like a governor let™s sa
y, you could call it, a German. Or
 they found an Austrian who 
had been a Nazi, and made him the ma yor, let™s say. 
They also released all 
the political prisoners 
who had been put in prison because they kille
d, like this Chancellor Dollfuss, who was killed. 
His killers we re let -- were let out. So it -- that
 was all well thought out, a
nd this -- this is how 
that happened.  

Q: Okay, why don™t we stop righ
t here and change tapes. 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
22 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Now you were discharged fr
om your business, and it took you 
a few months to get out. How 
did you spend your time in those few months? 
A: We ll, mo st of the time we would go and stand 
in line, trying to get information about how to 
get out, i-is there a -- a -- a possi
bility of getting a visa to certain
 places. That™s how mo st of the 
time was spent almost -- almost every day. The re
st of the time, I -- I visited friends. There was 

really nothing to do. I did not walk the streets if 
I could help it. You stay 
as low as possible. You 
try not to be noticed. In fact, 
my father and mother, who were Polish citizens -- I was born in 
Vienna, but they were born in Poland -- beca us
e of that, I was consider ed a pole --  a citi -- a 
Polish citizen. And so I -- people started like a 
business of emblems that 
you wear, and so I wore 
a Polish emblem, to indicate that I will -- was a 
Polish ci tizen, thinking that  that  would protect 
me . And anybody who had anything that they coul
d wear, they would put on. Of course, if you 
were a Nazi, you put in your lapel the button, th
e swastika button. And so 
I carried this, thinking 
ma ybe this -- this would protect me . Th 
-- well, evidently it did, although, you know, I was 

pushed off the street, did not walk on the sidewa
lk with some body else and 
that -- that sort of 
thing. 

Q: We ll how did people know you were a Jew?  

A: We ll, I was not blonde and blue di -- blue eyes
. I lived in a certain district, and people -- by 
the way, we had to carry an I.D. card that indi
cated that we were Jewish, an-and that™s one 
reason why I™m opposed. I hope to God it never happe
ns here. But so they knew if I had been 
picked up, they knew, of course, that I was Jewish.I lived in that district. And if I did not wear a 

swastika, I was suspect. So I think it was very s
imple. It™s either you wore a lapel button or an 
armband, or you didn™t. So it wasn™t
 -- it was not very difficult. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
23 
 
Q: Was the identity card the new thing? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: You™d always had those? 

A: Yes, yeah, always had that. In fact, when I we
nt to the bank, when my 
parents send me to the 
bank to take money out, and the system is diffe
re nt, you -- you -- you go to the teller, you put in 
your check, you get a number. And I guess they check and see if you have the money in the 

bank. And then they call your numbe r. When my
 number was called, they said to me, your -- 
your account is closed. They knew I was Jewish. That
 -- that -- that -- that™s how it happened.  

Q: We re you ever put on any work details, or -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- rounded up, or anything like that? 

A: Oh, I was rounded up to wash 
the streets, I told you that. 
Q: We ll, you actually didn™t describe th
at very much in this interview. 
A: We ll, I was walking -- I was walking on the st
reet, in fact, I was walk
ing with a girl, other 
than Trude, and forgive me  Trude, a nd mi nding my
 own business when across the street, there 
was this action, called an action. Th
e streets had been full of paint 
in anticipation of the vote, so 
there would be all kinds of lette
ring in the street, or on the walls
. And what they did, is they 
picked up Jews, and they ma de them
 clean it. And I was walking in 
the opposite side of the street 
when this -- this fellow who I thought was my 
friend, grabbed me  and pulled me  over, and ma de 
me -- made me clean the street. That™s exactly
 how it happened. And that
 wa -- that  was a -- a 
tremendous shock. A-Aside from that, you know, lik
e I told you what happened at the school 
where I was surrounded by peopl
e, I was not beaten up, no. 

Q: We re you shoved off of sidewalks? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
24 
 
A: Oh yeah, that, sure. Yeah. Shoved, or I would 
just be plain cursed at
. People just -- some  
people just took pleasure in simply cursing 
you. The -- the -- the house where we lived had 
ma ybe 25, ma ybe 30 apartments, and it was alre
ady even with our house -- our apartment 
building rather, there we re Jews and non-Jews living there. And some  of the non-Jews already 
started to take over apartments that the Jews lived in, that  they liked better. So there was 

neighbor turning against neighbor. 
We had a superintendent of the building who was not Jewish, 
who would warn us, actually. He -- he was a pr
etty good person. Would warn us if they saw, you 
know, Nazis comi ng, to lay low. It wa s -- it was -- ye
 -- you learned not to real
ly -- I hate to say 
that, not to trust anybody, because you live in constant fear. It remi nds me some ti me s of how 

cattle herded into cars, and they™r
e taken to slaughter. And some how, this is what happens to you 
as a human being. You begin to develop fear li
ke you feel like you™re being herded. Yo -- you -- 
you -- you change. You change because you don™t 
-- you even walk different, you -- you -- you 
don™t -- you™re just a totally different person. 
And unless you live through it, you -- you wouldn™t 
-- you wouldn™t understand it. We  didn't realize it. We
 did not realize it. Th
e -- the -- when I saw 
a uniform, it scared me . It sc -- when I came to America, when I got off the ship, and I saw 

police officers talking to people as friends, I coul
d not get over it. I -- I me t a -- the ma n who 
brought me  over was at the ship to pick me  up, 
and he was with a -- a -- a gentleman and he 
introduced me . He said, this is Rabbi Mezuer
. And I looked at the ma n, and I called Shep 
Saltzma n aside and I said, ﬁHe™s not a rabbi, he™s
 a spy.ﬂ He said, ﬁWhy in the world would you 
say that? ﬂ  I said, ﬁWell, he™s clean-shaven, he do
es not wear a skullcap 
and he speaks perfect 
German.ﬂ Anybody, when you hear that German in
 back of you, you have fear. I mean, that -- 
this is what happens to you in just a few mont
hs. Fortunately, the wounds 
heal, if you -- it -- it™s 
just like anything else, if you cut yourself and --
 and there™s an infection, it keeps on going and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
25 
 
going. If you let it heal there™s a sc
ar, the scar never leaves you. Th
e scar is there, but it doesn™t 
fester. And so all this that you go through, if 
you™re fortunate enough you can survive it and still 
live a normal life. 
Q: During this few months that you stayed over th
ere, did you continue to observe the Sabbath, 
did you have a Passover? 

A: Yes, of course. We  observed, sure. It --
 it was perhaps even more me a ningful, mor e  
meaningful than ever, yeah. Th
e -- the question that 
perhaps underlying your
 -- your question is 
did you lose faith, and no we did not. This is --
 my father would always
 say, don™t worry, God™ll 
help. I told you before, that™s 
the way he was. Oh, don™t worry, God -- God is going to help. No, 
we did not -- we -- we did not go to synagogue
 because I -- one of th
e synagogues was a very 
small place where we went to, and that one 
was -- was demo lished, totally demolished. So 
whatever se rvices were at home, and some ti me
s a -- a friend would come  over, or a relative 
would come  over, and you sit together, and you obser
ve the Friday night, and I must say that the 
food was not as good as it was before, but that -- th
at really -- that -- th
at didn™t ma tter. You -- 
you cannot -- you cannot lose hope. If you -- if you lose hope -- 

Q: Sorry. [interruption] The meals weren™t ju
st good because you couldn't afford the food, or 
because food was ratione d and there just wasn™t much? 

A: We ll, first of all, we di dn™t ha ve money. B
ecause as I told you, we -- in fact, my mother 
started to, at the beginni
ng would go to the pawn shop and it was -- it was called 
[indecipherable], it was run by the governme nt, a
nd would pawn things. But then after a few 
weeks we realized that this is
 not going to get be
tter. There was no sense to pawn it when you 
know you can™t get it back, so we began to sell. A
nd there you got a little more money, and this 
is what we lived off. So t his -- and we did get 
some  money fr om relatives, both in Poland and in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
26 
 
Czechoslovakia. The relatives that
 sent us money through this trai
n conductor, half of the money 
went to him. That was his -- his take, because he 
put his life in danger. So we had some of that 
money, we -- we -- we had paid for the ticket on th
e ship. We  took -- when I left Vienna we took 
eight -- the equivalent of eight do
llars in my pocket. But the ship
 was paid for. And then I had 
prepaid I think some thing like 10 or
 20 dollars that I could s -- 
that was part of the travel 
expense, that I could spend on the boat. So when
 I came to the United States, I had left  a dollar 
and 60 cents, out of th
at eight dollars.  
Q: How -- you me ntioned that peop -- you -- you lin
ed up along with other people every day to 
try to ge t out. Wa s there an immi gration policy in place at that point? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Wa s it?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Wa  -- how easy was it for people to get out? 
A: We ll, you could only get out if
 you could get in. In other words, you could not get out unless 
you had a place where to go. And mo st of the co
untries did not want you. For instance if you 
escaped to Belgium, which is what happened to
 my wife , the Belgium 
government would give 
you a 30 day permit. And then you have to come  
and register again, and 
if you™re lucky you get 
another 30 day permit. So it was not easy to ge
t out unless you had a place where to go. The 
world simply did not want us. What™s the use of 
kidding? When I compare, as an example, what 
happened in -- in recent history, under Presiden
t Carter, where ma ybe 100,000 or mor e  Cubans 
were let in, there was no such thing where the Am
erican governme nt say well, come . Or -- or not 
just the Ame r ican government, any of the other 
governme nts. That did not happen then. So, we 
had no place to go, nobody wanted us. But there were
 always rumors that -- yeah, you could get, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
27 
 
I think into Australia if you had 
the equivalent of ma ybe 10,000 do
llars or so, but who had it?  I 
mean, we -- it was taken away from you. So we
 -- we didn™t -- when my mother and father 
ultimately left  Vienna, all they had left  in the 
apartment was their bed and a table and two chairs. 
Everything else was either taken 
or sold. That™s -- if you can vi
sualize that. When I went through 
it, my -- my sister and I, Paula left Vienna, I 
did not know that I would ever see my mo ther and 
father again. In fact, that was 
the saddest day in my life. They 
took us to the train station, of 
course, and we pulled down the windows of -- on th
e -- in the car, and we  held hands. And then 
the train started to move, and my mother and father
 walked with us first, and then ran as long as 
they could, holding hands. And then we no longer 
could hold hands. And we pulled out, and they 
became s ma ller and smaller. I never thought I wo
uld see them again, never. These are the -- 
these are the kind of things that 
stay with you all your lif
e. Fortunately they -- they were able to 
come  over, there was another mi racle. A -- a woma n at the American embassy was helpful for 

that. When I went to get my papers at the Am
erican embassy, you stand in line -- you™re scared 
to death anyhow, you don™t know wh
at™s going to happen. You go through a physical exam, and 

you have all your papers. And there was a -- a wo ma
n sitting at the desk and I liked her looks, 
and I said to my mother, ﬁI like
 her looks, I want her to exami ne 
my papers.ﬂ We come to her, 
and she looks at my papers and she says, ﬁIs th
is your mother?ﬂ And I 
said yes. ﬁAre your 
parents going with you?ﬂ I 
don™t know what ma de me  say it, I sa
ys, ﬁNo, but they will as soon as 
their affairs are straightened out.ﬂ
 They had no papers. So she gets up -- I reme mber this vividly, 
and she takes my file and she puts it in a file. Th
at™s all I knew. When we
 received a wire from 
our mother and father saying we™re -- we™re comi
ng in -- I think it was in -- I™ ve forgotten the 
date in November. And when they finally came
, I didn™t have enough mo ney to go to New York 
to meet them in New York, but I had enough m
oney to call them. And I 
said, ﬁTell me , wha -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
28 
 
how did you get out?ﬂ And my mothers says, ﬁDo 
you reme mber this wo man at the American 
embassy?  She called us and she says, are you re
ady to leave?  You ha
ve a special quota.ﬂ 
Because my sister and I were mi nors, they put 
us in a special quota and followed up, and this is 
how my mother and father came here. 
That -- that™s another miracl e.  
Q: Did you ever -- I™m trying to sort of i magin
e the mi ndset. It was very clear to you that you 
needed to leave. Did that ever get confused by so
rt of a feeling of deser
tion of your past and of 
your community? 
A: Oh, never. Never. Not for a mo ment, never. Th
ere was no loyalty to Austria. What loyalty -- 
Q: But to the Jewish community there?  

A: No, no. Never thought about that
. No, not at all. The only thi
ng I would feel guilty, I said -- 
felt bad about, was leaving my mo
ther and father. But it was quite
 clear, and my parents spoke 
about it, they said, ﬁLook, you™re young, and we
™ve already lived a lo
t of our lives. We™ll 
ma nage somehow, with God™s help.ﬂ No, there 
was never a feeling of
 deserting anybody, or 
leaving anybody. The first time  I went back to Vi
enna, after having lived 
in this country for a 
number of years, I remember I 
-- I could not -- I couldn™t wait 
to show my American passport. 
Oh, American. You don™t realize what that means 
to be an American. And ti -- the ma n at the 
border when you -- when you checked your -- your passport says, ﬁOh, you™ve -- you™ve come  

home.ﬂ I said, ﬁOh no, my home is America.ﬂ I ne
ver -- the only thing I 
-- I -- if I ever mi ssed 
anything about Austria was I get 
nostalgic when I hear the musi
c, and some  of the food. But no, 
not at all. Unfortunately we™ve been back to Au
stria several times, but the last time I was there I 
experienced anti-Americanism, and anti-Sem
itism, and I will never go back, never. 
Q: Tell me  a little bit about your jour
ney over here with your sister and -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
29 
 
Q: -- we can sort of move forward there unless -- unless -- 
A: No, no, no, no, okay. Now I™ m -- I arrive in America. 

Q: How was  the trip over, were you -- 

A: It was wonderful, wonderful. You know, I was 18 
- 19 years old, I -- we went second class, 
there were three classes on the ship. I was on a 
French boat, I me t peopl
e. And interestingly, I 
have to tell you this, I was kosher. I observed th
e Shabbas, and never smoked on the Sa bbath, I 
never ate ham, for instance. When I got on the 
ship, I asked the -- the 
headwaiter, I says, ﬁDo 
you have a kosher kitchen? ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ he says, ﬁyes.ﬂ I 
say, ﬁI want to see it.ﬂ So he took me  into 
the kitchen, I said, ﬁWhere is you
r kosher kitchen? ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ he says
, ﬁthis is kosher meat, and this 
is not.ﬂ And I says, ﬁAnd that™s
 it? ﬂ He says, ﬁYes.ﬂ I says, ﬁ
I™ll eat what everybody else does.ﬂ I 
mean, it -- it was a farce. And th
en the other thing that happened
 to me , my sister caught me  
smoking, and she said, ﬁMy God Max, 
it™s -- it™s Shabbas.ﬂ And I had 
not realized that it was the 
Sabbath, you know, you lose track of time. So that™s 
when I -- that™s really what happened to me , 
I -- I no longer observed the diet
ary laws, and I -- I s -- smoke d on the Sabbath, and of course 

worked on the Sabbath. So my trip over was -- wa s 
really very pleasant. I 
met some pe ople that I 
stayed in touch with for a -- a number of years,
 and when I came  to Ne w York, I was a -- my 

mother had two sisters who lived in America, w
ho never responded to our letters -- while I was 
there, let me add, but ultimately did write. Well,
 anyhow, so I had cousin, picked me  up, together 
with this ma n Shep Saltzma n who brought me  he re. 
And he said to me , he says, ﬁI have a few 

days in New York. If you li -- want to stay with
 your cousin, come  and then come  to Greenville 

in -- in a few days.ﬂ So I stayed with -- with 
my cousin. The first experience I had, and this is 
interesting. They looked at me  and says, ﬁOh you don™
t look half dead.ﬂ A
nd I said no. But -- but 
you -- you look okay. They expected me  to be a sk
eleton. And the only thing we could take with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
30 
 
us was clothing. Then they told me , ﬁOh, you don™t wear
 these clothes here, this
 is -- this is not -- 
you have to wear American clothes.ﬂ But ma ke a 
long story short, I stayed with them for about 
two or three days, and then th
ey -- they bought me the ticket, a train ticket, to come  to 
Greenville, South Carolina. My sist
er stayed in -- in Newark, that™s
 where my aunt lived, to see -
- she says, ﬁWhy don™t you go and see what it™s 
like?ﬂ My relatives in Newark said, why don™t 
you go and work for cousin Joe?  We had a cousin who -- who had done quite well, he was an 
imme nsely wealthy ma n, who was a very good pers
on, he gave every -- every immi grant a job. 
And I said no, I™m going to South 
Carolina. So they bought me a p
ack of cigarettes and gave me  
a sandwich and I had a ticket and I we
nt to Greenville, South Carolina. 
Q: Let me  just -- before you go on, let me  ask 
you some thing. When you arrived in Ne w York, or 

in America, was there anythi
ng that really struck you? 
A: Oh God, yes. There was freedom. Freedom. U
nbelievable feeling. I ne
ver had that feeling, 
ever. I mean, here you come  off, after this expe
rience scared to death, es
pecially of uniforms, 
scared of hear a -- a German word, scared to mo ve, or scared to have some body walk in back of 

you, and here it™s just this ma ss of pe ople, and people are laughing, and -- and it™s -- it™s 

unbelievable. You have to experience it. This -- th
is is -- was freedom. It™s
 a -- it™s a -- it™s a 
wonderful thing. So this was -- it™s
 just like new life. If
 I had been given a -- a transfusion, it wa -

- it was wonderful. I have never -- and I -- I was 
happy from the mo ment I got off. I was -- I was 
happy to get on the ship. I never had any doubt. That 
-- that™s interesting. I 
never had any fear of 
the unknown, so to speak. I was so happy, I would have done anything. And when I got off the 

train in Greenville, for instance,
 the ma n who brought me  over he
re, he was at the station. The 
girl I had met in Vienna, she was 
at the station, and he 
-- this Mr. Saltzma n says, ﬁCome, I™ll take 
you to the factory.ﬂ But on the way -- this 
was around noon, he says, ﬁLet me  buy you lunch,ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
31 
 
and I said, ﬁNo. I -- I -- I™m going to pay for my 
own lunch.ﬂ You have to reme mber, I could get 
lunch for a nickel or a dime . And he said, ﬁNo, le
t me  pay.ﬂ I said no. I said, ﬁ When I can afford 
to take you for lunch, then you can take me  for lunc
h.ﬂ I was so concerned not to take charity. I -
- I wanted to be on my own. I™m getting a little em
otional. So I got in -- 
I -- I -- I paid for my 
soup, and then about noontime I went to the 
factory and I started working right then, 
imme diately. And they put me  in the shipping departme nt because his office was on the same  
floor as the shipping departme nt, 
and besides that, in order to 
sweep floors you don™t have to be 
fluent in English. I had learned a little Eng
lish by the way, from the time I knew that I was 
comi ng until I got here, I learne d enough to say he llo, good-bye, I love you, or I see you later, 

you know, I -- I wouldn™t get lost. But anyhow, so 
I started working in the shipping departme nt, 
sweeping floors, carrying boxes and 
that sort of thing. A very interesting thing happened to me  
the next day. I get a call from the offi ce, paging 
Max Heller, come  to the office. Scared to death. 
I come  to the office and she says to me , a judge
 is here to see you, Judge
 Plyler. I said, oh my 
God, they™re going to send me  back. That™s the 
first thing I thought of
. There was something 
wrong. And here is this tall, handsome ma n, and he
 introduces hims elf and 
he said, ﬁI am Judge 
Plyler, I have come  to welcome you.ﬂ Excuse 
me . He says, ﬁI™m -- I™ll be president of a 
university this fall, and I want you 
to think of my home  as your hom
e. I wi ll see that you learn to 
speak English, we have students here that™ll help
 you.ﬂ And that was my welcome. It means so 
much. A simple act of kindness can undo bitter 
things. Just reaching out. So, that was my 
beginning in Greenville. My sister
 came several weeks later. I liv
ed with the -- with the fa mily 
for a week. And I -- by the way, my first paycheck 
was nine dollars and 90 cen
ts. It  was really 10 
dollars, but 10 cents was for Social Security. 
And I worked seven days a week, ma ybe 70 - 80 
hours a week and I was very happy to. I would ha
ve done anything. So, after one week, I lived 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
32 
 
with this family who was a supe
rintendent of the factory. Ca me  
the end of the week, I said, ﬁI 
want to pay you.ﬂ ﬁNo,ﬂ he says, ﬁI don™t want 
you to pay me .ﬂ I says, ﬁI™m not going to stay 
free, I -- I have money. I have nine
 -- I have nine dollars and 90 cen
ts.ﬂ I said, ﬁI want to pay you 
or else I leave.ﬂ He says, ﬁNo, you cannot pay me
.ﬂ So I had found out there was another Jewish 
fa mily who took in borders and they charged seven 
dollars a week to be a border. So I moved in 
with them, I paid my seven dollars, and I saved a
bout a dollar, a dollar anda half a week out of 
the difference. And then, ultimately, I moved with the family that br ought me here. And they 
were wonderful to me , absolutely wonderful. And 
he gave my daughter --
 my sister a job, and 
my sister came  over and we both stayed with th
em. And -- and I insisted 
that I pay them. And I 
said, I will not -- and I did. And so she worked
 in the office, I worked in the shipping 
departme nt, and I™ll never forget -- I reme mber a 
-- a few months after I came here -- I used to 
listen to the radio a gr eat deal, th
is is how I learned -- I went to
 movies, which were 10 cents, I 
think, but listened to the radio a
nd I l -- I learned by the sound, and 
-- English and -- and it -- it 
didn™t take me  that long. So one da
y I learned that there was a bill
 in the Congress -- I heard that 
on the radio, to have a mi nimu m wage. And it wa
s to be 25 cents an hour, for 48 hours, I think, 
and time and a half over that. And I says, oh my
 God, 48 times 25 is 14 dollars, I ma ke 10, and 
overtime?  I was all for it. And I™ll never forget 
that, the republican -- I di
dn™t know the difference 
between democrats or republicans. The democr
ats, however, I learned, proposed the mi ni mu m 
wage, and the republicans were -- opposed it. That™s when I became a democrat by the way. I fig 

-- I figured I™ll ma ke 14 dollars an hour. And --and of course the bill 
-- bill went  through, and 
interestingly enough, after 48 hours, 
I checked out the time clock, I di
dn™t get time  and a half, but 
they gave me  money to have supper with. And 
my work, I ma de progress in my work. A few 
months after I was in the shipping departme nt, th
e forema n in the shipping departme nt left. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
33 
 
so I went to Mr. Saltzma n, I said, ﬁI™d like to 
have his job.ﬂ He says, 
ﬁHow can you have his job, 
you can™t speak English.ﬂ I said, ﬁI
™ll show them what to do.ﬂ He said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ I mean really, 
this is how it happened. And I became  fore ma
n in the shop. Then ultimately my parents came 
over and he gave my father a job. And my moth
er and father moved to Greenville. Ironically, I 
became my father™s boss. It was tragic. I mean, 
he was a ma n, he was 50 -- he was 50 years old 
when he came  here, and here I was, 19 at that 
time. And I told him what to do, and he schlepped 
the boxes just like I did. Never comp
lained, never. It wa -- never a -- not for a mo me nt  did we 
complain. So we moved into an apartment and ultim
ately I was able to buy a car, and a -- I made 
progress in my work. The internal sales ma nager le
ft. I was lucky, they were all leaving, and I -- 
again I went to -- to the owner of
 the business, I said, ﬁGive me  a chance for this.ﬂ He  says, ﬁBut 
how you gonna correspond with customers, you ha
ve -- I said, don™t worr
y, I™ll learn.ﬂ So I 
would stay every night, and I go through the files 
and I me mo rized letters.
 And I found out after 
awhile, well, if you have 10 letters, different situa
tions, pretty much that™s
 it. So I gave numbers 
to the letters and I had a secret
ary that would type them, and I™d say numbe r two, number three. 
And this is -- and I was very fortunate with 
-- given an opportunity. I also learned that if you 
want some thing, you have to ask for it. That ma n was wonderful to me . The day I me t him, I 

said, ﬁI™ll never leave you unle
ss I can go in business for mys e lf. That™s the only time  when -- 
when I will leave you.ﬂ Well, Trude in the m
eantime -- you reme mber Trude, came to America. 
She had a much harder time  than I did getting out. She escaped to Belgium and had terrible 

experiences. And in 1942, we were -- we were 
married. She came  to Ame r ica in 1940, and we 
ma rried in 1942. And her mother and father came to -- came  to Greenville with her, and her 

uncle did. This same  ma n, this Mr. Saltzma n who ha
d given a job to my father, to my sister, now 
he gave a job to her father and her uncle. He wa
s a -- this man was -- was an angel. He rests in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
34 
 
peace, I can tell you that. Then, after -- I made 
my -- and Trude, my wife, she worked in the 
factory. She -- she worked in the office.  
Q: Can I just ask what -- when 
did your parents finally get out? 
A: In November of 1938, yeah. So the whole fam
ily, we we re all working at the shirt factory. 
And -- and I had ma de progress there, I -- I was ther
e -- after six years, se
ven years, I became a -- 
a vice president of the company. He was very go
od to me , he  -- he sai
d, ﬁI™ll let you buy one 
percent of the business, and the way you pay fo
r it is from the profit.ﬂ And so I owned one 
percent of the company. Ultimately I did go in busi
ness for myself in 1946. I went in business, I 

left him. He was, I would say rightfully so, he
 was upset, because he had been wonderful to me . 
But I always wanted to be in business for 
myself, and we had saved up about 10,000 dollars, 
because every time I was promoted, I would get a 
very nice increase, and my wife worked, and I 
worked, and we -- we were careful. W- We ne
ver had a credit -- a charge card until we  had 
enough money to know that we can pay. So anyhow, I went in business with a partner in 1946, 
and went into the shirt business in a different c
ity because I didn't want to be competitive. And 
after two years we split. And he remained w
ith the business, and I had more money than I 
thought ever existed, because we had done well in t
hose two years. But as partners we  did not get 
along, and we had a buy or sell agreement. So afte
r I sold my share of th
e business, a few days 
later I went in business for myself, a nd my only 
partner was my wife. I st
arted a company called 
Maxon shirt company, and that wa
s in 1948. And the company did we
ll, and we, in the meanti me  
we had three children, three wonderful childr
en, two daughters and a son. We had bought our 
own home . It was modes t , and -- but we paid for it. 
And so I went into business, as I said myself, 
and that was in 1948. 14 years later I sold that 
business, and that was 
a philosophical decision. 
First of all we learned that you don™t worship 
money. And Trude and I felt the same  way about 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
35 
 
it. I had me t a friend of mi ne who had very bad 
business problems . And he -- I noticed that he 
was really beside himself, and I -- I said this -- 
this -- I just  won™t let th
is happen. And so I said, I 
don™t want to be the richest ma n in the cemetery. A
nd we had a chance to either go public, or sell 
the business. And I told Trude, I 
said Trude, ﬁI -- I want to se
ll. How do you feel about it?ﬂ And 
she says, ﬁIf that™s what you want. What are yo
u going to do? ﬂ  I said, ﬁDon™t worry.ﬂ So in 1962, 
after in business 14 years, I sold 
the business. And I stayed with th
e business for five years, I had 
a contract. I was active in the community as soon
 as I could. My first experience in community 
work was with a group of Christian wome n who we
re interested to do some thing about first and 
youthful offenders. It was my first involveme nt, and 
I became  deeply interested in that when we 
were able to get laws changed where youthful of
fenders were separated from hardened criminals. 
And I continued to be quite 
active in the community, includi
ng, of course, the synagogue, 
president of the synagogue and every Jewish organization. And then one
 day I received a call 
saying there™s a rumor that you are interested to 
run for ma yor. I thought -- that had never, never 
occurred to me . But I had been involved do so
me thing about housing for the poor. I became very 
interested in that, and I star
ted a housing foundation. And wherev
er I turned, I found that the 
government is involved. And I said no, I -- I™m no
t going to run for ma yor, but ma ybe I™ll run for 
city council, and I did. And so 
I was elected for -- on a two year
 term. And then after two years 
the -- the term of the ma yor wa
s up. And I -- I ran for ma yor and 
I was elected, about 70 percent 
of the vote. Interestingly enough, I ran as a demo
crat, I had no opposition 
from the republicans, 
but I had oppositions fr om the demo crats, and they
 -- the fellow who ran against me came to me 
one day, and he says, ﬁYou know, God came to me  
and said that I should run against you.ﬂ This 
is the truth. And I says, ﬁ Well 
God never said anything to me
 about you.ﬂ Well, make a long 
story short, I -- I was elected, and 
I was ma yor for a -- two four year 
terms, eight years. I also ran 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
36 
 
for the Congress. At the end of -- we -- we -- 
I proposed the term li m
itations. I felt like eight 
years is plenty, and so I could not
 run again and this --
 the congressional s
eat was open, and so I 
ran for that. And I won the primary, but I lost 
the election. Some  of th
at experience was anti-
Semitic. I had -- I had some anti-Semitic experi en
ces. I™m not saying that™s why I lost, but the 
fact is -- what happened was 30 days before 
the election a third candi
date entered and he, on 
Thursday before the election he called a news 
conference sayi ng that  Max Heller is not fit to 
serve because he does not believe in Christ. A
nd when you go to Wa shington, in time  of need, 
who are you going to call on?  And I -- I thought 
this was ridiculous, everybody knew that I was 
Jewish, and -- and I -- I really 
-- I said -- my response was that
 people are not going to believe 
any of -- I mean, ma ke this an issue. My wife
 told me , she says, ﬁYou™re ma king a mi stake, you 
ought to really fight this hard.ﬂ
 I said, ﬁLook, it™s Thur
sday, the election is Tuesday.ﬂ Well, ma ke 
a long story short, I -- I lost 
the election by ma ybe tw
o percent, and then consequently I was 
asked by the governor of the state if I would serve 
as chairman of the state development board -- 
economic development, which is equivalent to se
cretary of commerce. And I did that -- we did 
that, I should say, for four years. And that was 
a very good experience. And 
then consequently of 
course, came home, ca me back home . We  lived in
 -- in the capital. Ou
r children grew up, we -- 
we had wonderful, wonderful family. We  now ha
ve 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild, 
and two great-grandchildren on the way, and we 
have -- we had a wedding not long ago, one of 
our granddaughters. We  have another one comi ng up 
in four weeks. We ™ve been very fortunate. 

We have good children, we have good grandchildren, 
and I must say that th
ey -- if there™s one 
thing that they have don
e that I am proud of, there is no intole
rance, no bigotry in those children 
or grandchildren. None. None whatsoever. And th
ey™ve had some  experiences where -- one of 
my grand -- one of my c hildren came home from sc
hool crying and says, so and so said that I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
37 
 
killed Christ. But it didn™t -- th
at did not change their lives. So
 they grew up very, very good -- I 
have a lot of -- very, very much to be grateful fo
r, and I am. I am very grateful. I™ve devoted, I™d 
say, the last 30 years of my lif
e -- I should say we, because my wife is the same  wa y, for the 
community. And I™ve had no regrets to be out of 
business. I got enough money when we sold the 
business to ma nage it careful. And we™ve had no [i
ndecipherable]. I™m not the richest ma n in the 
cemetery, I never want to be. And we -- we than
k every God -- every day that we are here, we 
are grateful. And we™ve told that to -- to our ch
ildren. We  tell it to -- we -- both my wife and I, 
we speak in schools, we speak in churches. And 
I think it™s important 
that people hear this 
me ssage. We often think that when we are dead, 
when this generation dies, it becomes a history 
in the books, or on videotape. And I think that™s on
e reason I consider it very
 important to do this 
interview, because this should not
 be forgotten. I wish that we 
had today copies of interviews 
that were done hundreds of years ago. All we 
have is mouth to ear, and wr itten. And some how, 
written history is not as powerful
 as when you can see it, or hear 
it. And I respect what is being 
done today, so that the -- the world should not forg
et. There has to be a le
sson in all of that. I 
don™t know -- we often wonder how --how -- really, how did this ha
ppen?  We  lost 90 people in 
the Holocaust, 90 of our fa mily were killed. On
e cousin survived in Czechoslovakia. She and 
four of her siblings and her mother and father 
were alive until the day when the Americans -- and 
they were in Theresienstadt, and the day when 
the Americans came in, the Nazis took trucks and 
ran over her fa mily and everyone was killed except she. How in the world? How can we forget 
that? And as I said before, these are the very 
same  people, Germany and Austria, and for that 
matter Poland, the Poles did thei r shar e of 
anti-Semitism. They had more churches. The 
Viennese loved music, and they -- 
they -- they produced some of th
e fi nest writers in the world, a 
-- the Germa ns did. And these are the very same  
people who perfected the 
art of killing. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
38 
 
nobody can tell me  that people didn™t know about
 this. When you think about it, hundreds and 
thousands of concentration camps, it took arch
itects, it took engineers, it took builders, 
carpenters, guards, railroad conductors, truck drivers. Millions of people were involved to 
commit this crime. And nobody can tell me  that 
people didn™t know about 
it. They should feel 
guilty. The new generation of Ger mans, I really 
think, is trying to overcome this. The Austrians 
have not learned quite as well. And yet, I find it 
very disturbing that in
 an election not long ago 
in -- in Austria, about 20 percen
t of the vote went to the Nazi move me nt. And that™s bothersome . 
That™s some thing that we  need to be concerned a
bout. I -- I™d like to -- I 
think this could be the 
end of my -- of the interview, unless you have 
some thing else that you want to ask me . I don™t 
know how we as a people can impa rt to others 
that there is so much good in the world, and yet 
there is so much evil. And what is so importa
nt, that the good overcomes the evil. Good people 
can become  bad, and I always say, find the good pe
ople, find those and pr
otect them. But also, 
speak up when you hear bigots. And what we have 
to reme mb er, hatred is hatred. If there is 
hatred against mi norities because of
 their color, it™s the same as
 hatred because of religion. And 
we, as Jews, especially those of us who surv
ived, have a responsibility, we  have a duty, if 
nothing else, to speak up. Speak up and help others
 to overcome this. If there is nothing else 

we™ve done, I think that that -- th
at has to be a mi ssion. So, we ha
ve not lost faith, we have not 
lost faith in people, and we have 
not lost in faith in our religio
n. I feel very good with what I am. 
And I™m ver y grateful. And if my children or gr
andchildren, or great-gra
ndchildren and my wife 
see this, I just want 
you know that I love you.  
Q: I actually do have a few questions. Do you wa nt
 to take a break, or do you want me to -- 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
39 
 
Q: I want to go back to I think when you first 
came  to South Carolina. I know that Americans 
can be insular, and I™m -- and you told me  about
 the -- the really wonde
rful, moving experiences 
you had with some  individuals. But when you came 
into this factory, and 
I suspect especially 
because you did well, did you ever feel resented because you were a foreigner? 
A: No. 

Q: Because you were a Jew? 

A: No. 

Q: I mean you -- 

A: Not in the factory, no. 

Q: In Greenville, it -- I -- I doubt
 there was a huge Jewish communit
y. I mean in -- or even a -- a 
huge European community for that ma tter. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: I™m just wondering what that felt 
like, if you ever felt different, or -- 
A: No, not -- not really. You have to reme mb
er, I would have scrubbed fl oors and sw -- and 
sleep on the ground. I was so happy to be
 there. I never -- I never felt 
-- i-in fact, I mus t  say that -
- I™ll never forget this, I was aske
d to make a talk, just after I™d
 been here a few months, and it 
was to a Masonic group. And I tried to tell them about the diffe
rence between America and what 
happened in Europe. And at the end of the tal
k, they passed a hat. And they presented me  
something like 30 dollars. Well, that  was a lot of
 money then. And they said, ﬁI want you -- I 
want you to have this.ﬂ And I said, ﬁI -- I canno
t accept that,ﬂ I says, ﬁI have a job, and I™m not 
hungry,ﬂ I said. ﬁBut if you let me  give this to a 
Jewish charity, I accept it
.ﬂ And they said, ﬁWe 
are honored to do that.ﬂ I once spoke at a church 
and I -- and I tried to 
bring out the difference 
between America and here, and --
 and some  of -- always was a 
question and answer period. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
40 
 
some body s a id to me , ﬁOh this -- America™s not as free as you think.ﬂ And I said, ﬁThe very fact 
that you can get up and say this without fear of 
being arrested, tells me  that this is a free 
country.ﬂ So, no I -- I -- most pe
ople were -- tried to be very 
helpful. The newspaper -- you 
know, we were an oddity in a way, because we were
 the first refugees, and so the newspaper was 

very interested. One of the pictur es that I cheris
h that I have was a picture with a policeman who 
put his arm around me . That meant a great deal to
 me . Here was a policeman who -- who was my  
friend. We  - -  

Q: So there never was any cultural adjustme
nt, or you were never ostracized, or -- 
A: No, no, no. When Trude and I, after we became engaged, we were looking for an apartment 

and we saw an apartment we liked, and I did not 
hear from the real estate ma n for a number of 
weeks and I called him fi nally. And I says, ﬁWha
t happened? ﬂ And he said, ﬁ Well I don™t know 

how to tell you this, but this ma n will not rent  to Je ws.ﬂ And I was -- I was shocked. I wa s 

shocked. And so, we went out looking for othe
r apartments and we saw one apartment in a 
wonderful section of Greenville, and we went in
 there, introduced our
selves, the lady™s name  
was Keller. And showed me  the apartment, and I sa
id -- and she told me  how much it was, and I 
said, ﬁMy -- we can™t afford that
.ﬂ I think it was like 80 dollars 
a month. And she says, ﬁPay me  
less, because I -- I li -- I want
 you. I want you to be here. I -- 
I like you both.ﬂ And I said, ﬁWe 
are Jewish.ﬂ She says, ﬁThat™s wonderful.ﬂ So, the 
experience I had before was offset by that. So 
there was very -- you know, I had very -- of c
ourse there was anti-Semitism. Some  pe ople had 
never seen a Jew. They thought we wear horns, a
nd things like that, and 
th-there are always -- 
there always will be -- it™s a quest
ion of degree, but no, I -- and when I ran for public office, yes, 
there was some  anti-Semitism, there was no question about it. A lot of it was whispered, and you 
know, people say, well, you don™t want 
the Jew to run this city, bla
h, blah, blah, but 70 percent 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
41 
 
of the people voted for me  and the other 30 pe
rcent did not vote against me  because I was 
Jewish, they voted against me because maybe th
ey didn™t like me , what I proposed. I was very 
open that I was for integration. Totally open. A
nd I -- you know, I was shocked, frankly, when I 
came to South Carolina to find the way it was segregated. Blacks were not allowed to work in 

the same  room with whites. The toilet s were ma
rked white and -- and -- and colored. There was a 
water fountain that the sign was -- said colore
d. I thought it was pink water. And -- and I was 
shocked by that. And when I had -- when we ha
d our own factory, one day I just took down the 
signs. And you know what happened?  Nothing. Peopl
e came to work the next day, they -- they 
sat next to each other in the can
teen, they used the same bathroom
s, they worked next to each 
other. Nobody complained. I think some  people we
re relieved that this was over with. So my -- 
my experience ther e was a great -- much greater shock than any kind of anti-Semitism. A-As I 

said, when I ran for office, I was very open with
 what I want to accomplish. And we integrated 
the city departme nts, we created commissions that
 were totally integr ated
. We  had a bricklayer 
next to a banker and they got along beautiful. Th-T
his is -- this ma de me  feel very good, I me an, 
very happy about that.  

Q: I was going to ask you in terms of your -- bo
th Jewish community and civic work, what you 
feel were your most me a ningful accomplishm
ents. I think especially given your background. 
A: One, I was ma yor. I -- I™ll tell you what meant 
the most to me, that™s -- but -- but -- I get a -- I 
get credit for having a rebirth of
 downtown, and I have -- I can s
how you newspaper articles, and 
people have been very nice, honorary doctorates a
nd all that. What meant the most to me, was 
we had a -- a -- a public bus system. While I wa
s ma yor, the people that ran the company came 

in one day and gave us 30 day notice that they
 were going to quit unle
ss we -- we subsidize it 
unlimited. And I said, ﬁWell we -- we can™t do that.ﬂ
 I called a meeting of churches, and I said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
42 
 
ﬁI know you have buses. Would you lend us some
 buses? ﬂ  And I had more buses than we 
needed. I went to the technical 
school, and asked them, ﬁ Would 
you train people to drive buses? ﬂ  
30 days after they gave me  notice, and they wa
lked out, we had a bus system running. Some  of 
the buses had signs, Jesus saves and all that. Peop
le laughed about it. That Christma s there was a 
parade and I -- I was -- my wife and I were in
 a open car, and what touched me  more than 
anything -- poor people that had to use thes
e buses depended on going to work, and people 
would yell out, thank you for the buses. That real
ly touched the people. Wh
atever else happened, 
of course it was meaningful and I feel good abou
t it, but that was the 
thing that brought me  
closest to the people. 
Q: It sounds like you were al
so active in civil rights
 efforts [indecipherable] 
A: Yes, and I -- and I s -- I still am. Right now I co-chair a small committee, a bi-r acial 

committee. We™ve had some  problems in the jail a
nd that sort of thing. 
Yeah, I -- I™ve always 
been. I™ve been involved in -- I™v
e been -- been involved in edu
cation for ma ny years. Fighting 
for better education. This judge who came to s
ee me was -- became president of a university 
called Furman University, and I™ve been involve
d with them for ma ny years on their advisory 
board, and we have a scholarship in the name  
of the girl that brought me  here. We  have a 
scholarship in the name  of the ma n who brought 
me  here, and we have a scholarship in Trude 
and my na me. And -- and that -- I 
think that™s -- that was important
 to us. Education is. And so 
we continue, we™re -- both of us continue to be ac
tive, and why not?  I live ther
e. This is my life.  
Q: It™s interesting that --  

Q2: One mi nute. 

Q: How ma ny? 

Q2: One mi nute. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395

Q: We ll, one mi nute, we mi ght as we
ll stop. So [indecipherable]. But -- 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
44 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: It™s okay. Couple mor e  questions. We talked
 a little bit about some
 of your political 
accomplishments and what™s meant a lot to 
you. The -- I™m wondering if you were impacted 
slightly differently because of your experience 
by -- by pivotal events of the last 50 years, 
whether it™s the civil rights 
move ment, the -- the wars today, 
the ethnic cleansing today, the 
Eichmann trial. 

A: Mm. M m -hm.  

Q: If any of -- or even th
e -- this -- the [indecipherabl
e] sort of birth of the 
state of Israel, if there 
are any of these events that 
were especially powerful to you
?  It™s a broad question, I know. 
A: Well, let me -- let me start off 
with the birth of Israel, because 
I think that was --  that was the 
turning point for the Jewi sh community of th
e world. I really do. Suddenly, every Jew was so 
proud to be a Jew. Really proud. And the -- there 
were -- people -- there we
re ma ny, unfortunate, 
that were not proud, they -- and 
I can understand that too. They™d
 had nothing to hold onto and 
suddenly here™s a state, a state 
of Israel. So that was -- that 
was a joy. People would come  up to 
me  on the street and congratulate me , as if I 
had anything to do with it.
 We™re so proud. And we 
were so proud, there was -- and -- 
and this is one reason I -- I -- I 
say we must -- we must support 
the -- the people of Israel. They™r
e the ones that fought a battle fo
r us that we did not fight. My 
children and grandchildren have asked me , how
 c o me  you didn™t fight?  
I said, that™s a tough 
question. One grandchild esp
ecially, Danny. And it™s a tough, 
tough answer. And I said, ﬁ We 
had nothing to fight with.ﬂ Nothing. 
We were like cows going to slaughter. And here is this state, 
here this -- this new Jew, who is fighting. So th
at -- that is a great, great
, great happening in the 
history of the Jews, very dramatic. Without a doubt, 
that -- that™s been one 
of the events. But of 
course othe r events in my life are -- are real
ly very personal. Getti
ng ma rried, having children, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
45 
 
having grandchildren, an-and that sort of thing. I 
-- I reme mber at the United Nations there was a 
-- ther e was a resolution passed that
 was very, very anti-Israel. A
nd that particular day -- I was 
ma yor then -- I greeted several thousand Baptists
 who had come  to a convention, and I was a few 
mi nutes late getting there because I listened to 
the news program in the morning. And when I got 
up to greet them, I says, ﬁI have to pour my h
eart out to you. I am late because of what happened 
at the United Nations. How dare they did to th
is remnant of our people? God™s people.ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁYou of all people, you who are good Christians, you have to help me .ﬂ I got a standing 
ovation. And the next day -- and I still have a co
py of it, the newspaper wrote -- had -- had an 
editorial [indecipherable] Heller gives Hell to Un
ited Nation, bravo, or some thing like that. That 
was -- that was a good feeling, to speak up, but it 
was also a good feeling to be supported, then. 
So the -- these are [indecipherable] it™s so -- so 
hard to remember all the different things that 
happened to you. I just happe
ned to think of this. 
Q: I™m just thinking about all of the -- the -- th
e wars today and the ethnic cleansing in various 
parts of the world, does that
 stir up anything in you? 
A: Well, they asked me -- it does -- it does, 
it™s -- it™s just when -- when it happened in 
Yugoslavia and -- and Bosnia-Herzegovina and a
ll that, Trude and I be
longed to a group called 
Renaissance, and we -- once a year there™s a mee
ting in Hilton Head of hundreds of people. In 
fact, President Clinton, this is wh
ere I met hi m the first time. And th
is was -- that particular time  
I -- I was asked to have a -- sa
y something, a speech before th
is group. And what I spoke of -- 
about, this Holocaust, I called it a Holocaust. And I said, just because they are not Jewish, does 

not mean that it™s not a Holocaust
. And we don™t do a thi
ng about it. And this is tragic. And this 
was very, very, very important to me  to be able 
to say that. And there we
re governors there, and -
- and Clinton was there. And th
ere were mayors there, and ther
e were politicians there, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
46 
 
writers there, and it had to be said. This, I th
ink, was a bad thing that 
the United States waited 
that long. Because we of all people, we American
s of all people, must understand that we cannot 
let this happen to others. And I™m not saying 
that you go to war everywhere, but there are ma ny 
ways that we can assert our leadership. We are 
-- we are the leaders of this world, and I get 
passionate about that. There is killings going on 
every day, whether it™s in Rwanda, or whether 
it™s the Hutsies and the Tootsies 
and what have you. And we have
 to do everything we can to -- 
to stop that. That™s an 
obligation that we have. 
We are doing a lot. I w
ould say that the United 
States is really the one country
 in the world that is doing some
thing about it. Others totally 
ignore it, but we don™t, I mean we send help, we™v
e sent our soldiers, we 
-- and we still have 
soldiers over there. But on the othe
r hand we still have soldiers in
 Japan to protect the Japanese. 
We still have soldiers in Germany. We are part 
of NATO. And so when people criticize that we 
have soldiers in Yugoslavia to keep the peace, whyis that bad, and it™s not bad to keep them in 
Japan?  So you asked me  the right question, I guess.
 I -- I really feel very strong about that. 
Q: One more question, it™s this 
-- it™s a slightly different. 
A: Let me  just add one thing -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- but to be perfectly honest, I 
have been upset with some  of 
my friends -- ne -- the -- I™m not 
that friendly any more, that have -- that are im
mi grants like I am, like we are, and when this 

happened in -- in Yugoslavia, who said to me , ﬁThi
s is none of our business. What do we have to 
do with it?ﬂ And I said, ﬁMy God, 
you of all people?  You are saying 
what others said when our 
people were dying in Europe.ﬂ That™s exactly wh
at they sa id. And I-I -- I can™t underst and how 
people that have been through what
 we have been -- and -- and they™ve been through more than 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
47 
 
when I think what others suffered, I -- I did not.
 And yet, they say, oh, it™s none of my business, 
just because they don™t feel the pai
n, and they should feel the pain. 
Q: How -- how do you respond to the conditions in Gaza? 

A: Well, first of all, Gaza, I -- 
let -- let the -- the Arabs have Gaza,
 what™s there?. Wh at is there? 
Nothing. Peace has to become -- has to come to Is
rael and -- and the Arab
 nations. What is the 
answer if it™s not peace? You know, what is th
e alternative?  And how 
long can Israel go on and 
bleed themselves? And they are bl eeding themselves
, when -- when such a large portion of their 
national budget has to go for defense. So peace has to -- ha s to occur. Both Trude and I were -- 

were very, very honored to be asked to be pr
esent several years ago 
at the signing here in 
Washington. And I happened to sit next to an 
Arab woma n, and we both cried. She wa nted peace 
for her people, I wanted peace for my people, 
and there ha s to be a way. Land is not that 
important unless it is part of the national defe
nse. There is no compromi s e  on that. Beyond that, 
it™s only dirt. But the national de
fense without a doubt, and Israel is
 -- has to be realistic that 
Israel is surrounded by -- by ma ny enemies, and it™ll 
take generations, if ever
, that this feeling of 
hatred will change. But there is no answer, other 
than a -- has to be a peaceful solution. I wish 
Solomon wa s back. 

Q: Whatever happened to Mary Mill
s?  Did you stay friends with her? 
A: We ll, at first -- she wrote me  by the way, wh
ile I was still in Europe. I think you know Shep 
Saltzma n wrote me , ﬁI think you should know that 
Mary Mills is engaged to be ma rried this 
fall.ﬂ Most people thought there was a roma nce th
ere, and there wasn™t. I mean, we didn™t even 
hold hands when we wa lked. When we first -- wh
en I first came , her hus band -- her then became  
husband, there was some  jealousy there, I think, 
and -- and when Trude and I were ma rried, we 
didn't -- we s -- once a year we 
would communicate, and -- but ther
e was a distance at first. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0395  
48 
 
then, as we had children, and they had children, 
our children began to meet. And we we re -- we 
became -- we became really good friends. Mary Mill
s died a few years ago. She was my angel. 
The beautiful thing about it, she never realized wh
at she had done. To her it was a very natural 
thing. We ™re still friendly with one of her 
daughters who -- who did live in Greenville, but 
recently mo ved. So she is done, she™s -- her pictur e is
 -- is -- I have a pictur e of my fa mily in our 
bedroom, but I also have a picture of Mary Mills
 in that room. I don™t want my children ever 
forget who she was. I want them to know, t
oo. So that™s what happened to Mary Mills. 
Q: Is there anything el
se you want to add on? 
A: No, really, really not. I -- 
I think I poured my heart out. 
I appreciate what you are doing. I 
think it™s very important. I appreciate what the Holocaust Museum is doing for -- not just for -- 
for Jews, this is a Christian problem as well, 
the problem that we have. This is a Muslim 
problem, this is -- whatever happened to us -- us
 as Jews was -- is also
 a problem of the world. 
And the Holocaust Museum can serve to remi nd peopl
e that there can be evil, but also that there 
can be good. So I -- I want to th
ank you for the work that you do.
