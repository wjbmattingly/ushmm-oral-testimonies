Interview with Jan Nowak  
September 18, 1996 
 
Beginning Tape One, Side A 
 
Question: Why don™t we st
art, if you™re ready. 
Answer: Sure. 
Q: Just by a -- having you say your
 name  and identifying yourself. 

A: Yes, m- my na me  is 
Jan Nowak Je zi oránski. 
The 
No wa k
 is the 
nom de guerre
, and 
my real fami ly name  is 
Je zi oránski. 
Q: I™d like to begin with you telling me
 where you were, and what was happening in 
your life at the end of the war. 

A: Well, I was the fi rst survivor of the 
Warsaw
 uprising who was sent as an emissary 
by the Polish commander in chief 
of the underground army, and of the 
Warsaw
 
uprising to 
London,
 wit h mi crofilms, with the archiv
es of the uprising. And the first 
one who reached 
London
, on 22
nd
 of January, ™45. And of course, I did work for some  
time with the Polish authorities, debr ie
fi ng them, and also British and American 
authorities, lecturing, wri
ting, until I was hired by th
e Polish section of the 
BBC
, in ™48. 
And that was the beginning of my ra dio career. 
[sneezes] 
Excuse me. I was trained in 
my profession as a broadcaster by the 
BBC
, and I stayed with the corporation until the 
end of ™51. And th-then I was appointed the fi
rst director of the Polish service of Radio 
Free 
Europe
 in 
Munich. 
And I had to organize the entire operation, all day operation, 
from the scratch. I was the first Pole who wa
s hired, and my j ob was to recruit people to 
organize the operation, to create, you know
, the schedule, the programming, and all 

that, unfortunately. So I star
ted a sort of a second chapte
r of my life with Ra dio Free
 
Europe
, and this was probably, from the perspec
tive of my life, the most important job 
I had. Much more important than during th
e war, because during the war I was an 
emissary, and I was very active in th
e Polish underground moveme nt. But as an 
emissary I was rather a witness, an eyewitness of the game between 
Moscow, London, 

Washington
, and I saw the moon fr om both sides, from the perspective of 
Londo n
, and 
in 
Warsaw. 
But I cannot say that I did really influence any -- any decisions or events. 
While in the radio, we learned really that 
we have much greater influence that could 
have been expected. And I feel, and this is 
what the audience say, including such people 
as 
[indecipherable]
 opposition leaders, that we did 
have a considerable impact on the 
development in 
Poland
 between ™52 and ™89 when -- when 
Poland
 was liber ated, in a 
way. So this was my mo st important 
period of -- of la 
-- of my life.  
Q: I want to talk about that, I -- I™d like to 
go back to the -- the -- ju
st at the end of -- at 
the end of the war, w-where you were -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- a-and -- and -- and what you were
 doing. I understand you were arrested? 
A: I was -- I was only once arrested by Swiss 
authorities, when my wife and I illegally 
crossed the border. I was very lucky; I was 
never arrested by Gestapo. If I would be 
arrested Gestapo, I would probably not be 
here. But I was very lucky, and never --

never really fall into the ha
nds of -- of Gestapo, but when
 we crossed the border near 
Basel,
 we were imme diately caught by the 
Swiss border guards, and arrested. 
Q: What year was that? 
A: This was the end of ™44. It was just, 
you know, the -- the end of ™44, and the very 
beginning of ™45. And under pressure from Br
itish, we were released by Swiss, and 
allowed to cr oss into 
France
, which was already liberated. And from 
Fra nce
 by the 
military plane, we are -- we were taken to 
London.
 
Q: So when the war ended, you were in 
London?  
A: I was in 
London.
 
Q: And can you tell me  what -- what was going through -- 

A: Well, a-as I told you already, I was -- my 
job was really, to tell British and Polish 
about the situation in 
Poland
. The history about the 
Warsaw
 uprising. This was the 
time before 
Yalta
, and before the formation of the puppet su -- Polish governme nt in 
Warsaw
. So we -- we were at that time deeply
 involved in -- in a very desperate 
struggle to really prevent what happened in 
Yalta
. In other words, to
 s -- to rescue the 
independence of the country. And that took me  my first -- first years in 
London
. And I 
ma inly was focusing -- focusing on what was going on in 
Poland
. I was a kind of a 
advisor to the Polish exiled government, which still existed. 

Q: And whe r e were you living for th
e brief period after the wa r? 
A: In 
London. 

Q: In 
London,
 how long did you live in 
London?  
A: Until ™50 -- until the end of ™51. In 
other words, I spent six years in 
London
.  
Q: And how would you say your life changed after the war ended? 

A: We ll, unfortunately, I was in exile. All 
my plan, my -- really, my -- my  objective, I 
did want to be -- to be a sc
holar, an economist, and I was ju
st on the point of finishing 
my doctorate thesis when the war broke out. 
That was all lost. I had no chance, and no 
wish even, to return to my scholarly 
career. Frankly, you know, the objective was how 
to regain freedom for my country. And that 
was the ma in objective 
and there were only 
two -- two ways of -- of doing 
something. One was to try to 
influence public opinion in 
the west, a-and the governme nts in the west. 
And that was very difficult at that time, 
because immediately after the 
war. Still some kind -- the hopes existed that -- that 

wartime fr iendly relationship with 
Russia
 could continue. And second was, to try to 
influence and educate people in 
Poland
. And the -- the only way of doing it was by 
radio, because in 
Poland
 there was a monopoly of me dia 
in the Communis t  hands. And 
the only way people could learn truth, and lear
n about even their own situation was by 

listening to foreign radio. So it 
suited me very well to join 
BBC
 because I had a chance 

to broadcast to 
Poland
, although the contribution was negligible because the British 
really did not allow so-c
alled exiles to make any 
[indecipherable]
 contribution. Most 
of the programs were written by British, and 
our job was simp ly to transl ate it into 
Polish, and to deliver it.

Q: I could interrupt you for one second, I™m goi
ng to readjust this. So for those six years 
you were working for the 
BBC
 in 
London
, and -- 
A: You know who I was working for s -- no, I -- for the 
BBC
 I wor -- I worked fr-from 
-- since ™48 until the end of ™51, for three years.  
Q: What about the years from ™45, the end of w -- the war 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I already told you that I worked for the Poli
sh governme nt in exile, I mean, this is the 
answer, I mean --  

Q: Okay. Did -- when was the first time you went back to
 Warsaw
? 
A: After 45 years, the fi rst time I was in 
Warsaw
 in a -- a --  at the invitation of 
Lech 
Walesa
 on the 10
th
 anniversary of the Solidarity, or 
Solidarnosc
. And that was at the 
time when the first non-Communist governme nt of 
Poland
 was being formed. So it was 
-- I was there, yeah, I went to 
[indecipherable]
 to see for my self, on 20 -- on 30 of 
August, ™89, after 45 years. 

Q: Can you tell me  what  that was like? 

A: Well, i-it was a very movi
ng experience. For 45 years as 
the director of Radio Free 
Europe
, I was on the top of the blacklist as th
e enemy of Communist. And of course, I 
could not go back. And I never -- I wa s convinced that one day 
Poland 
will be fr ee 
again, because I sensed that the Soviet system
 ha s so ma ny inherent 
contradictions, that 
sooner or later these contradictions will br ing down the -- the system. But I never hope 

that it ma y happen in my  life. And it came 
unexpectedly really, and without bloodshed. 
And the people were -- felt that Radio Free
 Europe
 did ma ke  a considerable 
contribution to this bloodless liberation. And so I went privately on the 

[indecipherable]
 of, I believe it was 
TWA
 plane, or a -- or 
Pan American 
plane, and 
didn™t expect any welcome. I -- I thought some
 me mbers of my fa mily will be  there, bu-
but I didn™t know that Radio Free
 Eu r o p e
 did broadcast the news 
of -- that I will be in
 
Warsaw
, and the time of arrival, the plane. 
So, after 45 years, th
e plane -- I touched 
again the Polish soil, I was very moved, I saw the terminal with the -- this 

[indecipherable]
 
Warsaw
. And I saw ma ny people, crow
ds of people on the terrace 
and around the building. And I ask myself, 
why, how™s it?  I mean, it™s Tuesday, a 
weekday, why they should be there?  And th
ey -- when we we re going towards the exit, 
two Americans were behind me  an
d they said, there must be a 
VIP
 on the 
boat
, because 
a group of people are waiting in front of the 
plane. That was for me . And t he entire 
leadership of Solidarity was in the front of 
the plane, I had fantastic welcome, and -- by 
this hundreds of people who ca me  to the air
port. And the next -- 
I -- the next day, the 
hostess, my hostess, offe red that  she will ta
ke me  to the downt own, to the city. And I 
said no, because after all, I was born in 
Warsaw
, and I would like to be -- to see my 
city alone. I said, you will have a -- it was in 
suburb -- you will have a problem to find a 
taxi, because  they don™t stop, you have to fi
nd the taxi stop. I said, okay, I will ma nage. 
I went to the ma in street, and here was a ta
xi. So I raised my h -- my hand and su -- the 
taxi stopped. So I jumpe d in and the taxi 
dr iver said I know who you are, because you 
were on television, on the evening. Okay, he 
took me to the place which I requested,

and the fare was 
[indecipherable]
 it was 27 cents, because of the dollar was very high. 
So I decided, no, I will gi ve him a dollar at l
east. I gave him a dollar and he  said, keep 
this dollar for yourself. I said, why?  Ho
w much?  He said nothing. Why nothing?  
Because I wa s listeni ng to Radio Free 
Europe
 for so many years, free, wh -- I -- I want 
to give you -- offer you one free drive. And 
that was to me  very moving, you know, this 
one dollar was the best reward I got for 25 years of work 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Did you go back to your ol d neighborhood, or your old home ? 
A: No, 
Warsaw
 was destroyed, the house where I lived was rebuilt, but the place where 
I actually lived, nonex -- was non-existing. Where 
-- so that, no, I could not find any of 

my old places.  

Q: Did your visit to 
Warsaw
 bring back me mori es of -- of the war? 
A: Oh yes, definitely, yeah. 

Q: Can you talk a litt
le bit about that? 
A: We ll, you know, this was th
e city when I spent my ch
ildhood. My school, times of 
my -- my hi gh college, and where I spent my -- the time of -- of my unde rground 

activities, until I left  for the west, 
what ak --  what more can I say?  
Q: Was it -- were they -- the me mories, whethe
r it -- was the feeling the positive, or -- 
A: We ll, the po -- feelings -- th
-there was a feeling of trem
endous happiness, really, that 
I can be back in my own city, among my -- my ol d people. 

Q: In 1951 is when you began -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- working for Radio Free 
Europe
. 
A: Radio Free 
Europe
, right. 
Q: Where were you? 

A: Well, I moved to 
Munich. 
I got the housing there, and since that, until -- 
[phone 
ringing] 
Q: I was asking about your move to 
Munich
. 
A: Yes, well I moved to 
Munich
, it was December ™51, and took over my job and was 
organizing my -- the Polish serv
ice. I was involved in recur 
-- recruiting people. Run, 
dry run, training them, and organizing the 
program. The inauguration of our program 
was on May third, May third, ™52. 
Q: Did your experience in the underground 
help you in your job as -- as -- 
A: Oh yes, well it gave me  a very good 
knowledge of the -- of the situation in
 Poland
. 
Q: And you stayed as director from 1951 -- 

A: From 1951 until first of January, ™76.  

Q: During that period is ther
e -- is there any one stor
y or any one thing that you 
reme mber that stands out the most? 

A: Look, I mean, there were so ma ny storie
s. I -- I wrote the 
book in two volumes. I 
cannot possibly single out one story. There we
re so ma ny. It was a fascinating life, full 
of stories, and full of, let™s 
say adventures, different kind th
at -- during the war. But they 
were adventures. After all, th
e -- we had the -- I had several fronts. I worked with the 

 
Interv iew with J a n No wa k

American manageme nt and had to argue about
 the policy with the Americans. I had the 
-- my team, which was very large one. At one
 mome nt they were more than 100 people. 
And finally, the ma in front was Communi
s m, I had to -- to fight Communism.  

Q: How large was your staff? 

A: It di -- it started with a
bout 80 people, but later on it was much more -- m- more than 
-- more than 100. 

Q: And can you tell me  a little bit ab
out the -- the programming, how ma ny hours a 
day? 

A: Yes, it was the only all time  programming. We did start at five
 in the morning, and 
we ended after mi dnight. It was a sort of 
a continuation of the free Polish radio which 
did exist before the war. And we even adopt
ed some  features of the Polish radio. For 
instance, the cra -- the -- the program did 
end with the Polish national anthem. In the 
mi ddle we had, in the Polish radio at 
noon, they would transmit the so-called 
[indecipherable]
. You know, the very old tune, which was played by trumpeter on the 

top of the tower of the old gothic church in 
Kraków
. We did broadcast this, so in fact it 
was a kind of a substitute and continua tion of the Free Polish Radio. And we had 

everything, first of all news, every hour on 
the hour. 10 mi nutes news so that everybody 
in 
Poland
 knew that when, with the strike of an hour, you can turn on 
[indecipherable]
 
and he will hear the recent news. There were
, of course, political commentari es, round 
table di scussi ons, press reviews, all ki nd of, you know, political future, such as you find 

in the public radio, public tele
vision. But there was -- there we
re also the program for a 
-- for a th -- for the country, for the village, 
for -- for the farmers. And the program for 
women, program for workers. 
There was sport, musical programs, everything that you 
expect from the normal Polish -- normal h-home
 radio. This was, as I say, a substitute. 
Q: We re you yourself on the air? 

A: Oh yes, but not -- not re
gularly. I broadcast when some thing really very important 
happened. I did not broadcast every day, or 
even every month, but when some thing of 
great importance happened, then I wa s on the 
air. And people knew that it was -- that 
there was some -- something important in that time. 

Q: Can you give me  an example of -- of one of those times? 

A: We ll, for instance, in 1956, 
there were a big upheaval 
[indecipherable]
 and the 
Russians did -- or for instance when the Polish 
[indecipherable]
 was arrested, which 
was a big blow against the church, I woul
d go -- go on the air and ma ke my comments 
about it. Wh en they were anti-com -- anti
-Communist party uph
eavals in October ™56, 
then I would ma ke comments about it. So, whenever there wa s some thing very 

important, I was on the air. 

Q: You -- when you went back to 
War s aw
, you understood the impact that you had on 
those lives. 

A: Oh yes, because people were telling me . 

Q: How -- how did you know what impact you had on people™s lives in 
Po l a nd
 during 
the time  that you were broadcasting? 

 
Interv iew with J a n No wa k

A: Yeah. Well, in the fi rst 
place, we did meet people w
ho went to the west. Two, the 
most important indication of 
effectiveness were attacks -- pr opaganda attacks by the 
regime , which were very intense. Attempts to discredit us, discredit me , and 
jamming.
 I 
mean 
jamming 
was a very expensive operation, and the 
jamming,
 that indicated that 
they considered our broadcast as effectiv
e and dangerous. And fi
nally the Americans 
did have a contract with the measur
e audience analysis institutions in 
Demark , 
in 
Austria
, and they were conducting, you know, pub
lic opinion polls among people who 
were comi ng from 
Poland
. So we had pretty good indica
tions of our ef
fectiveness. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And letters, but we didn™t attach
 too much importance to letters. 
Q: We re any other -- did you stay in touc
h with any other me mbers of the underground 
that you associated with during the war? 

A: First of all, there was no underground move ment afte
r the war. There was for 
sometime, and was eliminated by the political  
police. But I had my friends, and some  of 
them would, in great secret, contact me  when
 they were in the west. So yes, I did -- I 
was in contact with my old friends and associates.  

Q: Are you still today? 

A: Oh, by -- by all means. Y -- y -- even mo
re, because it™s no longer any risk to 
anybody. 

Q: Y-You talked about how your experiences
 a -- underground gave
 you experience to -

- to do your job -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- at -- as -- at Radi o Free
 Europe
. Can you -- can you talk a little bit about how you 
applied some of 
those experiences? 
A: We ll, first of all I believed that I ha
d a very good knowledge of
 people, of mood, of 
the situation. Therefore, I coul
d build the program in such ma nne
r that  it is best tune to 
the me ntality, interests, traditions of the 
Polish audience, some thing I could not do in 
BBC
. In the 
BBC
, British were decidi ng what to broadcast and how. Here we had -- 
Americans ga ve us considerable editorial au
tonomy. They believed that only free Poles 
know how to broadcast to their comp atriots.
 And therefore I coul
d use my  knowledge of 
the audience to ma ke broadcast as effective as possible. 

Q: When did you come to the 
United States
? 
A: I did come to 
United States
 in November, ™77. I spent almost two years in a sort of a 

[indecipherable]
 we had a small house in 
Austria
 in the
 Alps
, 
[indecipherable]
 lonely 
house, with beautiful views and we spent al
most two years there, and I wrote my book 
co -- called, ﬁ
Courier Fr om Warsaw
,ﬂ which was later published, in underground in 
Poland
 and here in 
United States
 in English, then also in 
France
, in 
Holland
, in -- in 
Sweden
. And we spend this two years time, almo
st, not quite, simply to -- I -- I wrote 
my -- my wartime me moirs.  

Q: And you moved to the 
United States
 -- 
A: In November, ™77.

Q: And why did you decided to move to the 
United States
? 
A: Because I felt that I stil
l was not old enough to retire, 
that my personal friend, Dr. 
Je zi nski
 was the director of National Security 
Council, and I did decide that I could 
serve my old country by being here and by tr
ying to influence American policy towards 
-- towards 
Poland
 and my part of the world. This 
was an ideal place, close to the 
admi nistration, to the Congress. And with -- as I say, with few influential friends. 
Q: 
Zb i g n i e w  B r ze zi n s k i  
A: Wa s one of them, yes . 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But you see, people whom I knew in Radio Free 
Europe
 when they were very 
young, in the meanti me  they had high positions in the American life, so I had a lot of 
contacts. 
Q: What -- what was your position when you came here? 

A: I became the consultant to the National S
ecurity Council, and I was the consultant al 
-- until the present admi nistration. In ot
her words, to the end of President
 Bush
 term. 
And I became  national director of the Polish 
American Congress, which is an umbrella 
organization. A spokesman for 10 million of
 Ame r ican citizens with their roots in
 
Poland. 
Q: Can I -- can I ask you about your persona
l life, meaning your
 wife, and -- and -- 
A: Well, we met in the underground. She was a 
liaison girl, she was very active in the 
underground. And when I came back
 from my sec r et trip to 
Sweden
, I br ought with me  
the mail in mi-microfilms. A
nd the liaison girl who ca me  to
 pick up this film was my 
future wife. This is where we me t. And we were ma rried during the 
Warsaw
 uprising, 
with the enemy lines only 100 
years
 from the chapel where we married. And since that, 
we are staying together. It™s 52 years. 
Q: Have you had children? 

A: We  have no children.  

Q: Did you leave the Polish American congress at -- at the end of the 
Bush 
admi nistration?  Have you no -- no longer -- 

A: No, because the 
Clinton
 admi nistration no longer con-
continued consultants. There 
were no consultants. I wa s 
de facto 
consultant, and I am still in daily touch wi -- with -- 
with the -- with the 
NSC
, National Security Council. But 
I was -- I am no longer on the 
list of consultant s. 

Q: I wanted to ask you how -- how often 
you think about the experiences during -- 
during the war, and in the underg
round, if -- if ther
e are certain things that trigger your 
me mories, music, or food, or -- 

A: No, because frankly, I wrote my me moirs,
 I wrote my two books about my career in 
the radio, and I hoped that I can put it behi
nd me . Unfortunately, then the -- I had the 
interviews, and people asking, but I prefer to
 think about the present time and about the 
future, rather than about th
e past. It™s not very produc
tive to live in the past. 
Q: So you fe el as though writing your 
me moirs helped you mo ve beyond --

A: I -- I hoped it will be, but the people li
ke yourself come  and ask about my past.  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape One, Side B 
Q: You had said that your time at Radio Free 
Europe
 was the most important time. 
A: It was definitely, by fa r the most impor
tant. Frankly, you know, I never thought that 
the -- the words, as a vehi cle carrying 
ideas and infor mation may have such a 
tremendous impact. A-And first of all, fr
ankly we eliminated effectiveness of 
censorshi p, because it was enough to 
tune
 to us to learn everything that the censorship 
was trying to keep from preventing to know, 
to learn. So we destroyed the monopoly of 
me dia, ne -- monopoly of infor mation and e
ducation. As long as this monopoly existed 
and people were isolated from the outside wo
rld, and flow of information, th-they could 
have been brainwashed. But once they had access to free sources of information, they 

wou -- they rema ined independent in th
eir own mi nd and in drawing their own 
conclusi ons. The -- that was our role. Also, we did play a role of opposition and I 

discovered that the ruling group fights 
the opposition by doing what the opposition 
wants them to do. In other words, the 
[indecipherable]
 when it is widely known, 
government reacts to the opposition. They don™t 
want people to believe in what they 
say. And therefore they try to prove th
at you were wrong by acting exactly like you 
want them to act. We  -- our first rally, proba
bly it was the most important event in the 
history of political broadcasting. After 
Stalin™s 
death, and after 
Beria
 was -- was killed, 
a very high official of the Polish political pol
ice, who had -- knew all the secrets -- all 
the state se crets and pa rty secrets, defected 
to the west. And after being debriefed by the 
CIA
, we could use him and he was broadcastin
g all the secrets of the party. And th-
there were -- the -- the entire
 Poland
 was listening. And political --  they ha d to fi nd 
scapegoats because he wa s revealing all ki nd 
of crimes committed by the leadership. In 

order to defend themselves, they put all th
e blame on the political police and they -- it 
was reorganized completely. And the resulti
ng chaos really -- I mean, decreased the 
terror. You know, people were no longer afra
id because the entire apparatus of the 
repressions was paralyzed. And it was 
bef -- because of the effect of 
[indecipherable]
 
that opposition in 
Poland
 could became  much more artic
ulate. They could speak. They 
could, in a sense, organize themselves
. And that was our ma j or contribution. 
Q: Mm-hm. I -- I was curious
 ha -- how you at Radio Free 
Eu r o p e
 dealt with the issue 
of anti-Semitism.  

A: We ll, you see, right after the war, I beli
eve that anti-Semitism was pretty dorma nt, 
but the regime , which was under great attack
 from the west, for violating democratic 
institutions, for forging the election, in a wa
y that they want to -- to compromi se the 
Polish people, and there are str
ong suspicions that so-called 
[indecipherable]
 was 
instigated by the political pol
ice in order to, you know, compromi se the Polish people, 
but in fact, th-the sad part of the story is th
at this kind of provocati
on is that ther e was a 
provocation, did find a fertile ground. There 
was people who did the

historical fact is that 42 i
nnocent Jews who survived the 
-- the Holocaust and lost many,

ma ny of their relatives and friends
, were murdered by the Poles in 
Kielce, 
and this is 
something that I myself, as a Pole, I am ve
ry a m -- ashame d of. And I believe that we 
should and we did -- 
Poland
 did apologize for it. The
n, you know, there was a anti-
Semitism made in 
Russia
. 
Stalin --  Stalin 
was anti-Semi  -- was anti-Semitic, and 
shortly before his death, he ran so-called doc
tor™s plot, accusing hi
s doctors of Jewish 
background of plotting against hi s life. Andthat was a signal for kind of anti-Semitism 

that was instigated by Russians in orde r to 
divert the attention of people from their 
poverty, from the inefficiency of the Comm
unist regime , and to find a kind of a 
scapegoat. Je ws were to be a scapegoa t. A
nd this was the kind of anti-Semitism spread 

by the Stalinist faction, called 
[indecipherable],
 in the Communist party. And they 
were opposed by intellectuals, liberal inte
llectuals. And a mong the intellectual 
[indecipherable]
 there were many Jews. And this is when we fi rst really started to fi ght 

against anti-Se mitism, ™54 - ™55, after 
Stalin™s
 sudden death, when this was the me ans 
to compromise, liberally mi nded Jews who we
re in opposition to th
e party line, to the 
party system of work. And there were some
 very outstanding intellectuals, who were 
opposing this kind of anti-Semitic trend, and we did a lot to support them t o 

compromi se the anti-Semitism as a -- 
something that is imported fr om 
Russia
. Seeing 

as the people at that time hated Russians, 
this was probably the most effective way of 
fi ghting anti-Semitism. We did -- dedicated lot of time and work to it. 

Q: You had a lot of programming that -- 

A: A lot. Scri pts, they are sti
ll in -- in existence, script s. 

Q: I think you had said in -- in the ot
her interview that th
e -- your time in the 
underground was the mo st fasc
inating time of
 your life. 
A: It was fascinating. We ll, in the undergr
ound I had adventures. There wer -- this was 
a time a -- war time adventures. And the -- in Radio Free
 Europe
, it was much less 
romantic. We were simply broadcasting, writing program. 

Q: What is your attitude now toward -- toward 
Germany
? 
A: We ll, first of all, I hate hatred. In other words, I am strongly against the idea of 

eternal enemies. The Germans inflicted terrible, you know, blows to 
Poland
. They not 

only murdered the -- mo st of the Jewi sh
 population, but the -- but about two million 

Poles were killed in the concentration camps
. The y were executed, or deported. And the 

-- the years of Ger man occupation were year
s o -- of terrible huma n tragedies. So 

frankly, you know, of course I had very strong 
feelings against the Germans. But after 

the war, when I was in 
Germany
, I discovered that you cannot 
generalize, that there are 
also some  Germans who are decent, and who 
would like to frankly, compe nsate in some 
way f-for what they di d to the Poles. I --I -- 
well, this is probably 
a postman. Yeah, I -- I 
can do -- do it later. And ma  -- the only pr
oblem I  had with the Germans is their 
territorial claims against 
Poland
, which were extremely dangerous to our existence 
because 
Poland
 was mo ved westward. We  lost one-th
ird of our territory and our people 
were annexed by -- by the 
Soviet Union
. And we were compe nsated by the big powers 
in the west. A considerable part of former 
Germany
 was incorporated into post-war 

 
Interv iew with J a n No wa k 
 
 
September 18, 1996 
 

 
 
10
Poland
. We  couldn™t possibly lost it 
again, it would be then a sort of a remnant state. 
And so this was the ma in problem between
 the Poles and the Germans, but in 1990, 
Germans recognized the border as final. It wasratified by the parliame nt. And as of that 

date, it was a turning point. And once the Ge
rmans reconciled themselves with the post-
war borders, they are no longer a threat and 
there is a tremendous improvement in the 
Polish - German relationship, which I™m very
 happy about, because I -- I believe that 
hatred is a boomerang. If you hate other 
people, they will hate you. And so the 

reconciliation between 
Po l a nd
 and 
Germany
, which is very real, is probably the best 
achievement of -- of this
 Solidarity governme nt. 
Q: When you see that kind of hatred in -- in 
Bosnia
 and other places -- 
A: Oh, terrible. 
Q: -- wh-what -- what  does it -- 
A: We ll, you know, this is -- you know, the 
hatred brings about unspeakable human 
sufferings, loss of life, tortures, everything. Se nseless. Senseless. 
So ethnic hatred, and 
any kind of ethnic or racial 
pr ejudices are extremely da
ngerous to humanity, and to 
everybody, including to Poles also. So I am very happy that 
Po l a nd
, after it go rid of its 
-- the Communist and Soviet domination is wo
rking towards reconciliation with all its 

neighbors, with Germa ns, with Lithuanian
s, with Ukrainians , Czechs and so on. And 

restored all the mi nority ethni
c rights to -- to the --  
its -- its ethnic mi norities. 
Q: In -- in the video interview you did, you 
talked about how angry you were, that it 
was a crime that the world didn™t do more to 
stop the Holocaust, that it didn™t listen. 

A: Absolutely. You know, this was my very
 tragic experience, because frankly, I was 
again an eyewitness. Of course the Je ws were
 isolated, they were 
behind the walls. But 
we could -- I could still see 
the starving Jews who would es
cape from ghetto and die on 
the paveme nt from -- from starvation. So 
it was s -- it was a tragedy, huma n tragedy 
without any precedent. We did lose two milli
on ethnic Poles, but only Jews were really 

condemned to death simply because they were born Jews, and had no chance to survive. 

And I was the -- the first envoy who brought th
is information about the Holocaust, with 
my colleague , 
Jan Karski
. And then I will -- I followed. I was in 
Stockholm
 at  t h e 
time of the uprising in the 
Warsaw
 ghetto, and I knew about it, and I wrote a 
me morandum to the Polish governme nt that they should exert their influence on the 

British that so me  kind of re
taliatory measures should be
 threatened to stop the 
extermination of Jews. And I know that the me mo randum was passed to 
Churchill
, but 

he was not prepared to any -- to any -- 
the only thing he -- I believe that my 
me morandum did contribute to the decision to
 prosecute after the war wa -- German 
Nazi war criminals, because soon after the d
ecision was ma de to install the tri-tribunal, 
and announcements was ma de that Nazi crimin
als will be br ought to justice. Then I 
came back, it was July ™44, and the ghetto no 
longer existed, but there were ma ny Jews 
in hiding. And I got instructions to pre -- 
to b -- to prepare myself for my  second 
mi ssion to 
London
. And to be briefed, to learn about
 the whole thing, 
so that I could 
again bring about some  me ssage, about what™s
 -- what happened to the Jews. So there 

 
Interv iew with J a n No wa k 
 
 
September 18, 1996 
 

 
 
11
was a ma n by the name  of 
Volitski
, who has his, you know, plaque in 
Ya d  Va s h e m
, he 
-- he was -- who was the kind of a liaison w
ith the Jewish militant  organi zation. I spent 
hours with him. He told me all about the -- 
the uprising and all that. He was himself in 
touch with it. And I got on mi
crofilms the report of the su
rvivor of the Jewish ghetto 
uprising, and also photographs, documen
ts, which I brought in my secret 
[indecipherable]
 as mi crofilms. And I was the on
e who brought this report of the 
Jewish militant organi zation to 
London
. I reached 
London 
in December ™50 -- ™43, and 
th-this report was passed by the Polish govern
me nt to the British governme nt, to the 
organization and I was -- I did see ma ny me
mbers of the British cabinet, members of 
the Parliament, intelligence -- people fr om
 intelligence community, and I was telling 
about what happened to the Jews. And, fra
nkly, you know, as far as the British cabinet, 
there was no response. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And whe n I talked to 
Eden, Anthony Eden
, the foreign secretary, he told me , Mr. 
No wak
, the best way and the only wa y we can he
lp Jews is by winning the war. If we 
divert our limited war, you know, mi litary res
ources to such objectives as bombing the 
tracks, it will delay the end of the 
war. And you know, when I came back to 
London
 
with my wife, when I was writing my me moir
s, and we went to Her Majesty™s records 

office, archives, I found piles of documen
ts concerning my mission, including the 
reports from 
Eden
 to 
Churchill
 about our conversation. Not 
one word about the Jews. 
Not one word. I took to all of them, I raised
 the question of Jews
. And I -- I strongly 
believe that retaliatory measures would have
 offered at least a moral help. That they 
would know they are not ignore
d, that the -- the world is -- 
sees that trad -- trade -- 
tradegy
 -- tragedy. So I feel that 
-- but even Jews would not believe me . I me an, I wa -- 
there was a Polish Jew by the name  of 
Schwar zbat
, who was in the Polish, you know, 
sort of a -- a parliame nt in exile, and he put
 me  in contact with the American Jewish 
organization, 
Joint
 and others. And I spent hours with them, they didn™t believe me . 
When I said that two million -- at  least 
two million Jews were already killed, they 
thought that this is unaccepta
ble exaggeration, and that I 
must have some political 
motives --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- in telling this st ory. 

Q: Di -- it would seem that your frustr ation during that pe
riod ma de you more 
determined in your work later on -- 

A: Absolutely. 

Q: -- to see that changes occurred. 

A: Absolutely. I must say that I used th
is very powerful instrume nt, Radio Free 
Europe, 
to fi ght anti-Semitism. But all -- also we did not generate hatred toward Germans or 

Russians. We were, you know, defending our na
tional aspirations, but the per -- th-there 
was no purpose of really generating feelings 
of hatred, because I strongly believe that 
hatred is a boomerang that 
would hit the Polish people back. And I was pa -- at the 

 
Interv iew with J a n No wa k 
 
 
September 18, 1996 
 

 
 
12
times when you know the -- the -- there was again the outburst of party anti-Semitism. 
In times of a man who was in char ge of political police, poli -- poli --  by the name of 

Motcha
, and he was anti-Semitic. And he re
ally unleashed anti-Semitic propaganda. 
And the 
[indecipherable]
 of Jews, there were ma ny Jews in the governme nt, ma ny 
Jews in the all kind of position, and there 
were ma ny Jews a mong the university youth. 
And h-he star ted a campaign of anti-Semitism, like in 
Russia
. And by discrimi nation, 
by persecution, by threats, he forced th
ese people of Jewish background, who 
considered themselves Poles, to leave th
e country. There was a 
-- an exodus of young 
Jews who didn™t even know they were Jewis
h. They were completely assimilated with 
the Polish culture . And there were Polish writ
ers, Polish scholars. And this was again 
unspeakable tragedy for them. And we were goi
ng out of our way to at least offer these 
people a moral help by condemning it. And 
I had a lot of satisfaction when, for 
instance, a Polish essayist  a
nd -- and writer by the name of
 Ro man Cast, 
who had to 
leave the country under this kind of purge, 
and he became a professor at what it™s 

called,
 Brooks -- Stone -- Stonebrook 
University. He came to mean and said, Mr.
 
No wak
, if not for Radio Free
 Europe
, I and my daughter wou -- would ha ve committed 
suicide. And we were on the -- on the verge 
of doing it. But your broadcast ma de us 
believe that we are not alone
, we are not isolated. That 
our -- and -- and the kind of 
moral comf ort that we got by listening to Radio Free 
Europe
, really, we decided, no, 
we w -- we will leave the country, we -- but 
we -- we -- we will live on with all this. 
And this was for me  a tremendous rewar
d. There were my former colleagues, 
Jan Kott,
 
who is a very highly respected Ame r ican scholar, was my sc hoolma te. He was of 

Jewish background. And they were all really high
ly appreciative of our -- of our efforts. 
Also, during the 
Israel
 six -- Six Days Wa r, we were 
on the air from the morning until 
night, and the 
Israel
 embassy got I don™t know how ma
ny flowers, me ssages, from our 
listeners. Because of cour se, since it was -- since 
Russia
, 
Soviet Union
 was on the Arab 
side, Polish people on the -- were on the Jewi
sh side. So I think it was -- I am very 
proud of -- of this effort, which under my 
leadership was undertaken by Radio Free 
Europe
, in fighting hatred and prejudice. 
Q: Do you think the world is capable of experi
encing a -- the -- the kind of hatred that -- 

that the Germans had, an-and the kind of killin
gs that they carried out during the war? 

A: Well, Germans themselves di d a lot to w
eaken this feeling. After all they -- they 
made the democratic 
Germany,
 did not deny what they ha
ve done -- what -- what was 
done in the name  of Germans, but they were trying to first of all ma ke truth known to 

every German. And they were trying to ma
ke g-good for what -- th
-these are things -- 
nobody can restor e life to six million people. But they have done a lot to recons -- for 

reconciliation with the-- with the Jews in 
Israel
 and in the 
[indecipherable]
. 
Q: But do you think that the world is capable 
of -- of -- you know, 
s -- you talked about 
your frustrations in -- 
in -- in -- inaction -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- for the rest of the world s
eem -- seem
ingly didn™t do enough -- 

 
Interv iew with J a n No wa k 
 
 
September 18, 1996 
 

 
 
13
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- during the war. Do you think that could 
happen again?  Do you think that the world 
could stand by? 

A: Well, you look at 
Bush 
now. I mean, this was ethnic cl
eaning, which ma y be an o -- 
perhaps was not a systematic murder in the f
actories of death, but 
nevertheless, people 
were being killed simply because they happene
d to be born Muslims. Or -- or Serbs, but 
mostly 
[indecipherable]
. This is again the same  trag
edy. The world should really 
encourage by every possible means, exchanges of people, personal contacts, 

reconciliation. And I am
 very happy the Polish gover -- 
government, afte
r the fall of 
governme nts, are doing their best to seek re
conciliation with thei
r neighbors, not only 
with Germa ns, but also with 
pole -- with Lithuanians, for in
stance. So that before the 
war, 
Poland
 was at -- at the war with all its ne
ighbors, no longer so. And I am very 
happy about it. 

Q: I wanted to ask you about one thing you 
said, that you thought 
your report to -- to 
Churchill
 I believe it was -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- helped with the investigation of -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- Nazi war criminals. Can you ta
lk a little bit more about that? 
A: Well, that was not a matter of investig
ation, because Germans were still occupying 
power. But against warning Germans about so
me kind of retaliatory action, that if you 
don™t stop this systematic mass murder of Jews, you will be puni -- punished. And I 

said, you bombed 
Germany
 anyhow, why not to say these 
are our retaliatory measures 
for what you are doing, for instance, to Jews. 
And that was not -- not accepted, this kind 
of 
SOS
.  
Q: I wanted to ask you about, you have these 
pictures around your livi
ng room of -- of -
- o-of you meeting with, I th
ink every president from -- 
A: 
Carter.  

Q: -- 
Jimmy Carter, 
and also the Pope -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and 
Lech Walesa.
 Can you tell me  about those experiences, what it -- 
A: We ll, I really -- as you said, I worked w
ith all of them, and w
ith thei r stuff. And I 
must say that all of them did play a very c
onstructive role in restor
ing democracy in east 
central 
Europe
 and in 
Po l a nd
. 
U.S.
 policy since the end of 70™
s, is a story of success. 
And -- and I am non-partisan and I believe th
at both democratic admi nistrations of 
Carter
, and now 
Clinton
, and of 
Re agan 
and 
Bush
, contributed greatly to rebirth of 
democracy, and regaining sovereignty by thes
e countries. And so to each of them we 
owe some  debt of gratitude. I mu
st say that since the time  of 
Woodrow Wilson,
 no 
other president did more to 
Poland
 than 
George Bush. 
And t his is not my partisan 
view. It™s simply that he was -- 
got deeply involved in support for 
Walesa,
 support for
 
Solidarity, and then he ma
de possible take o
ff, successful take off of the free ma rket

economy, by offering considerable assistan ce, economical assistance, by reducing 
debts. So, I must say that I consider 
Bush
, on the Polish sector as the president who did 
a lot to combat the Communists for the overthr
ow of governme nt, and for installation of 
democracy. Democracy and a free market economy. 

Q: Do you reme mber anything significant th
at -- anything stand out
 from what these 
me n told you? 

A: I would have to -- to th
ink about it. There were some  
stories, the problem is to

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: Can you tell me  about the Presidential Me
dal of Freedom that 
you received recently?  
A: Well, ni -- I wa -- it was a very unexpect
ed honor, which I never s -- either sought or 
expected. But of course, once if -- I got it, 
I am very happy about this. It™s a recognition 
of ma ny years of work and struggle for the 
common values, because since the beginning 
of the Cold War, 
United States
 goals and objectives were identical with our asp -- 
Polish aspirations. We  did want to regain
 freedom, sovereignty and democracy. And 
you na -- it was in the interests of 
United States
, and 
United States
 spent a lot of 

money, a lot of efforts to support our aspi
rations. So whatever I have done for my 
country of birth, I have also done for my a
dopted country. And th -- I am happy that my 
contribution was recognized by the president. 
Q: Would you mi nd reading that? 
A: We ll, you -- you should read -- please do read
 it. I don™t want to read it because I 
don™t want to advertise myself
. If you want to read it, okay, I™m not going to do it. 
Q: Wi  -- it -- the award men
tions your -- your work in the 
underground as well as your -
-  

A: Yes. 

Q: -- work for Radio Free  
Europe
. 
A: Yes. We ll, I guess that even by br
inging, you know, secret reports of our 
intelligence, I did make some -- some contri bution to the w-wartime effort. They were 

important reports, I am told, 
although I would neve
r know the content of
 it. It were -- 
they were hidden in these small objects
, and th-they are -- 
they were a key, 
[indecipherable],
 shaving utensils, and I 
never really read them
, but I wa s told they 
were important. The British gave me  the Ki
ng™s me dal for courage -- King™s Medal of 
Courage, which was very rare decorations, rese
rved to the foreigners who contributed to 
the British war effort. And this is th
e highest civilian 
distinction that 
United States
 is 
offering and I am proud of it, I am very happy a
bout. I did -- this -- 
the decorations we re 
never my objectives. I did not work to get 
honors and positions and 
all that. But when I 
get them, I am very happy. 

Q: What -- i-it -- I keep thinking of how your
 -- your work in -- 
in the underground was 
never your objective. I mean, you were reacting to circumstances, and what happened 

then led you to the path that you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- you took, and had it not been for 
your experiences in the underground, you 
probably never would have -- 

A: True. 

Q: -- gone in the direction. 

A: Absolutely. I think it was a kind of 
interlude. Bi -- I w
ould never get into 
BBC
 
without my wartime record. And then my 
wartime record brought the attention of 
Americans to my person. So, I was -- became pretty well known, and I -- I believe yes, 

the radi o career was a kind of a cont
inuation of my wartime activities.

Q: Can you tell me  what  you™re working on now 
[indecipherable]
 
A: We ll, I -- I am still, infor mally speaking, 
an consultant . I wa s until recently national 
director of the Polish American Congress. I 
was national director for 18 years, and I 
resigned last July, and -- in protest, fra
nkly, because I didn™t like some  kind of a 
statement of the president of 
the Polish American Congress, which in my view had an a-
anti-Semitic undertones. It was in connection with the 
K-Kielce 
pogrom. 
Q: What was the statement? 
A: The statement was that 
Poland
 should not apologize for th
e pogrom, a nd I violently 
disagree on that. I think if you ma de a sin, th
e only way is to admit, and to say I am 
sorry. So I, fr ankly, you know, believe that I 
have to be faithful to my values, and I 
resigned. But I am still very active as a sort of informal consultant , almost in daily touch 
with the 
NSC
, with the State departme nt, with
 the agencies that deal with 
Poland
, and 
with the me mbers of the congress. It™s a 
kind of lobbying. On a -- in addition, I write a 
lot. I have a fortnight -- 10 mi nut
es talks on the Polish radi o in 
Warsaw
. I record them 
every fortnight. And I -- I publish 
a lot in the -- in the Polish media, in spite of my late 
age, in spite of my age. 
Q: Have you been -- 

A: I am -- I am pretty busy, I must tell you. 

Q: Yes. It™s -- it™s apparent. Have  you been to the Holocaust Museum?  

A: Many time s. I was immensely impressed. 
I think Holocaust Museum is fantastic 
success, and it -- first I was really looking at 
-- at the exhibits. But when I went for the 
third time I was not looking at the exhib
its, I was looking at the public. And I was 
impressed by the fact that there were 
crowds of young Americans. There were 
teenagers. And I watched -- watched how i mpressed they were. And you know, they -- 

when they were comi ng, they were laughing, 
they were you know, talking, whispering, 
everything. When they came to see one of these 
exhibits, shoes, total 
silence. They were 
so impressed, they stopped talking. And then
 I overheard one girl telling other, look, 

each shoe is a human being. So I think that
 educational importance of the museum is 

fantastic, and -- and became  a landmark of 
Washington
, I -- I can -- anybody that 
comes from 
Poland
 wants to go to see the museum. 
And -- and I think it™s a great 
success, the museum is a great success, a
nd it -- I hope it will have a considerable 
educational impact on public. 

Q: Right. It was really such a 
short time  ago, I mean it™s -- 
A: Exactly. But it™s extremely well planne
d. I mean, people who were building the 
museum had the imagination, sort of a strate
gic way of thinking, and it is so well done, 
thought out, that it is really one 
of the most interesting things 
that you can see in -- in -- 
in the capital of -- of 
United States
. 
Q: Do you -- have you had any contact with
 -- with survivors of the Holocaust 
[indecipherable]
  
A: Oh yes. They -- I do meet the m, and have very friendly. 
Mice Lederman 
is my 
personal friend. We  are -- we are very close to 
each other. He is a survivor. His wife is -

- is --  is -- was in 
Auschwit z
. As a matter of fact
, I was with Mrs. 
Lederman
 in 
Ausch wit z
, and she has said, this barrack, this is
 the barrack when I and my two sisters 
were living. So I -- I do know 
ma ny, ma ny survivors and we 
are on very good terms. As 
a ma tter of fact, as a eyewitness of the Ho
locaust, I was ma ny times invited by Jewish 
survivors to tell about my story, to tell what
 I saw, particularly 
o -- by -- by the children 
of survivors. There were huge meetings. I was in 
Chicago
, long time ago, in 
Skokie
. I 
don™t know, there were probably 3,000 peopl
e there. Then I wa s invited to 
Los Angeles
 
by 
Simon Wiesenthal 
Institute and they offered me  a kind of a diploma that I am on 
their roll of honor. And I was telling them 
the story. And then I was invited to -- to 
Ottawa -- Ottawa
 in 
Ca nada
. Again, big gathering of survivors. And I -- I always have 
a standing ovation. And I asked, look people, 
I am not telling you anything new. After 
all, y-y-you -- if you didn™t go through it yourse
lf, then your parents who survived, told 
you all about it. Why are you so very interest
ed in?  And they said, because we sense 
compassion in the way you tell the story. And 
we still believe that the worl d is st ill 
indifferent. And when we saw the man who is
 emotionally involved in this, it gives us 

some  kind of a good feeling. 

Q: Hm. 

A: I will ha ve  to finish ve ry soon, you know. 

Q: I™m -- I™m just -- 

A: Quarter to two. 

Q: I™m just about finished myself. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: I -- I™m wondering what kind of affect 
the -- the war experience had on your faith, 
and on -- on your spiritual outlook. 

A: Yes, well I am a -- a Catholic, and I am a 
believer, and I think that the war was just a 
chain of mi racles. I mean, how I survived?  
I was trying to count how ma ny times I was 

one inch from death, and I couldn™t count it, 
there were so many of the situation and I 
always felt that some  invisible hand is real
ly carrying me  through all these dangers. It™s 
-- it™s -- the -- the fact that I 
was never arrested is a mi racle in itself. But also you need 
the -- after the war in ™62, I be
lieve, the governors who had the plan to kidnap me  when 
I was in 
Helsinki
, to watch the festi -- you -- youth 
festival, sponsored by Communists. 
And I believed that the g -- the g -- Ameri
can intelligence intercepted some messages, 
and I was just left -- I wa s warned, go back immediately to 
Munich, 
take the next plane. 
And I did, and there are many indications th
at they were, in f
act, trying to, you know, 
lure me  into a boat, boy scout™s boat, wh
ich -- boy scouts came there and they were 
trying to invite me to visit 
their boat, and of course, I w
ould never go there, I mean I 
realized this is dangerous. So I was mir
aculously saved ma ny times. And I -- I am a 
believer, and I -- I -- I -- I am a Catholic, a
nd -- and I will be  to the end of my life. 
Q: The story that stands out in my mi
nd is -- is when you were helping the young 
Jewish girl -- 

A: Yeah.

Q: -- through some  sort of checkpoint.  
A: That™s right. 

Q: And you were so close to being found out. 

A: We ll, this was again a mi racle, you know?  
The je -- the gi rl was -- had a s -- Semitic 
features, you know?  I wa s crossing the border 
very often, illegally, with the forged 
documents, but it was not written on my 
forehead that I am a me mber of the 
underground. Here was a girl who was obviously
 Jewish, and they were not allowed to 
go outside the ghetto, and to us
e public transport. And they
 we -- she would have been 
executed instantly. But I would be with her, 
this -- with the same  -- sa me  pistol. And 
never in my life I was so afraid at that 
-- this mo ment. My -- my -- my knees were 

trembling when it was all over. But I was 
-- frankly, I was happy I have done it. 
Q: I was going to ask you if there was a
nything that you would have done differently. 
A: You know, I reme mb er one thing that my 
mot her could never forgive herself and my 

brother and I. There were two Jewish child
ren, and probably she was no more than nine 
or 10, and her brother wa s ma ybe four. And 
it was before the ghetto was sealed, and 
they were going from house to house, aski
ng for food. So they were immediately, my  
wife -- my mother immediately invited them
 inside, gave them bread, soup, everything. 
And she said, well ma ybe you -- ma ybe you would 
like to stay tha -- and she said no, 
because the parents are in ghetto. We ha
ve to go back. And what happened, these 
probably poor children were later, you know
, killed, and we always felt we should have 
persuaded them to stay. And my wi - -  my mo
ther would never forgive herself, that she 
didn™t use -- tell them don™t go back, because 
sooner or later you will be destroyed. St ay 
with us, we will put you in -- in hidi ng, we 
will change the color of your hair and all 
that. And we 
[indecipherable]
 to the end of her 
life -- she died 95, she said, why did we 
not really persuade these child
ren to stay?  Yeah, and this 
-- this was the story that  I 
r e me mb e r .  

Q: Mm. 

A: Yeah. But they -- they were
 not -- she was -- said no 
[indecipherable]
 Mommy is in 
the ghetto, y -- and Daddy™s in the ghetto. Th
ey send us for food, but they expect us 
back. 

Q: Do you ever have dreams  about the war? 

A: No, I -- no, I really don™t 
di - have any dreams, and I 
try not to live in the past, 
because it™s -- it™s useless. I wrote down wh
atever I had to, I am telling you the stor y 

willingl y, but I wo -- I prefer to think about
 the present day today, and tomorrow. It™s 

much more productive. 

Q: I™ve asked all the questi
ons that I have, if -- 
A: Okay. 

Q: -- anything else you™d like to -- to
 say that we didn™t talk about? 
A: We ll, I think -- as I say, the Radio Free 
Europe
, I had three chapters in my life. The 
first was underground, the second was radio, the 
third is now. And I be
lieve of all three, 
radio was the most productive, because we 
did support effectivel
y, evolutionary, non-

violent change. And we ar
e told by the people in 
Poland
 that without this
 instrume nt of 
supporting evolutionary changes, bloodless 
changes, there would be no -- no end of 
Communism. And so ma ny peopl e 
wrote me  about it, told --
 Walesa
 was the one who 
said, with a -- if you -- not for you, we stay sy
mbolic because not my work, it™s the w -- 
collective work of all my fr
iend, I would not be there. 
Q: He told you that? 

A: Yes, and so did 
Garamic
 
[indecipherable]
. I was invited to speak before the 
Parliame nt and 
Garami c
 said, here is the ma n, wi thout 
this man we would not be here, 
which is exaggeration, at least in
 this sense, that I was part 
of a collective effort. And all 
the, you know, attention is focused on me , 
but I only personalize the effort of ma ny 
people who worked together, and w
ith the same  kind of dedication.  
Q: All right.  

A: Okay. 

Q: Thank you for talking with us. 

A: Thank you.
