Q: I wa nted to know 
how you got chosen for 
a di ffe rent work gr oup. 
A: Oh, that.  We used to get up in the morning, 
4: 00 i n the morning.  Had a 
cup of coffee.  Had t o  
ma ke c o ffee , you know I  -- You di
dn™t have anyt hing, 
no wood, no not hi ng, so y
ou used to t ake a  
big nail, a he avy one , put it into th
e ele ctricity, and have a little - - so
met hing, you know, l i ke a jar --  
and you put it in in the jar, an
d the water was boil i ng a nd you didn
™t ha ve coffe e, 
but _______, we  
used to call it.  It  is just  like something -- and we
 use d to have  in t he morn
ing, before we  went, t o  
have that, and a tiny little s
lice bread, and go to work. 
 Sometimes we di
dn™t have the bread.  So, at 
least to ha ve  war m insi de.  And I us ed to go out , 
I used to se e the Ba d (ph) Bri gade, but you ca n™ t 
get bec aus e there  was  a whole  lot  pe ople , but  I kne w 
them.  But fortunat ely, 
I used t o be
 lucky. 
Fort unatel y, they use d to pull me out f r om the Good 
bri gade, and take me to 
the Bad bri g ade .  Wha t  
means a Good brigade?
  A Good bri gade means 
you ca n wor k hard, it™s  no 
di ffer ent .   What it i s, 
you are young, you are healt hy, a
nd then you ta ke so methi n g to 
run in, around t he peopl e ther e  
because ______ used to be, and 
sel l  them somet hing --  like a sl
eep, a pl ace ( ph) , a somet hing,  
wh atever you had.  And fo
r that, you used to get some  fo od.  So
 at least -- or used to have some 
brea d.  Butte r?   We di dn™ t know what it means, but te
r.  No butt er, no mil k, no 
not hing.  But  at le ast ,  
wh en you had the bread, you see, 
the coffee, li ke I explained t o yo
u, i t ™ s oka y, you can make it . 
Who kne w what it me
ans, meat?  Nothin
g.  You didn™t have not hing. 
 But pota toe s was ve ry good, 
you know.  A potato you can mix 
up with s o me thing els e or  you 
ha ve t o ha ve .  And you ma ke  
somet hing, a dd meal  from 
that  (ph).  I reme
mber  one ti me, t hat t hey sa
id you can br i ng in food. 
We ll, the Good bri ga de - -  whe n you use d to ha ve  -- 
I used to take off my Star of Da vi d.  I looked 
like a _______.  And I was gone fr om
 one pl ace , fr om one door  to th
e ot her .   Until , you know, they 
use d to gi ve us s o met hing.  Some
 pe ople  sai d, ﬁ We  don™t  ha ve a ny,
ﬂ but  the y just _______ potat o

peels .  I sai d , ﬁIt™s oka y, too.ﬂ  I us ed to take pot
a t o pee l s.  Whate ver we c oul d get t o bring home . 
Pot ato pe els, the y woul dn™t bot he
r you so muc h  -- unle ss (ph) t hey
 used to t hi nk tha t you ha ve  
somet hing el se. 
Q: Now,  wh at wo uld happen if you 
got c aught  bri ngi ng thi s food ba ck?  
A: Terrible, terrible.  They used to 
send you in jail.  That 
-- you were lucky.
  I f t hey se nd you t o jail .  
But some was good for me , you know, wh o wa s th
e brigade commander s (
ph) , you know, wit h t he  
Ger man guards.  There was alr ead y good ones who l et you go to do -- 
some of them wa
s mur dere r s. 
The y di dn™ t.  If they had caught 
you -- it didn™t hurt me so much 
t he way they beat me up for the  
bread -- I didn™t kill th
e pain, but I killed the pain
 for the hunger, to be h
ungry.  For not having, but 
for taking away the bread
 fr om me.  You s ee what I mean?  Yo
u didn™t kill no pain
.  But pain was 
hunger , no food t o eat.  Star ving.  
So when we use d to go t he brig
ade, we used to have a Good 
brigade, so at least you used to ge
t some cl othes t o cha nge for  food. 
 So, when I used t o  come to the 

Chr istians there that knew me alre
a d y, so t hey us ed to gi ve me somet hing to eat, a slic e  bread, it wa s  
oka y, with s o me water. 

Q: Now, di d these  Chri sti ans  -- 
did the y t hink you wer e j ust  
a poor  far mer  gi rl or  wha t ?  
A: Hmm- mm.  The Christians? 

Q: Yeah.  When you went to
 get  s o me thing fr om t h e m. 

A: Well , I us ed to come back -- the y didn™t gi ve you
 for free .  But we wer e lucky that t he y gave us , 
for the cl othes, what they had, 
be cause the y figur ed, t hey s aid, th
at the ghetto -- the models (ph )  
fr om t he clot hes.  Because
 why?   Cl ot hes you coul
d have .  The y di dn™ t ta ke  a way. They took a wa y  
fr om you the books, the pa
intings, the grand 
things.  But clothe
s, as much as yo
u coul d, you could 
take it in.  The fur nitur e, everyt hi ng, you ha ve to gi
ve .  So you see?   So 
when you used to ha ve  
somet hing t o cha nge, why not?   They used t o 
give you, you know?   So t he y us e d to have a

_________, you see .  It
 me ans t hat you used t o have a good 
day wit h the  food, but what you got,  
you are ha ppy.  I wa s ru

the worst thing was 
i f you ca me  t o  
the ghetto, t o the bri gade, you know.  So, i f you 
had a good briga de , the n you go thr ough.  I f yo u 
have Ba d bri gade, y
ou™re  in tr ouble .  
Q: And how did you know 
whic h one  you were  in? 
A: We ll, that™s what ha
ppened t o me.  I was lo
oking for a  good brigade . 
 I knew wher e the good  
brigade was.  And I was mo
vi ng from one pl ace  to the 
ot her , and that ™s what I got ca ught , a nd t hat ™s  
what I got beat up.  But it didn™ t, like I said, it 
di dn™t bother me , it didn™t  hurt me, you know, t h e  
wa y I wa s beate d up, but it hurt me
 why I lost  the bread.  It™s 
ric h pe ople , known people , i n 
Lithua nia, they didn™t ha ve not hi

Q: Wh en you we nt to work, wh

A: My little girl -- I lost her before I got in the ghetto.  My mother, 
she used to take care of my little 
boy.  See, that™s why I c
ould go to work, because I 
know he™s in good hands. 
 But still, the fear -- 
because we used say in 
the other little cities, you know? -- they used to kill the children and take 
the m a wa y from t he pare nts, a nd s o on.  So as l
ong as I ha d my mother, my fathe r , I was strong . 
But the fear inside I 
had . . . if I had come home, I 
hope I could fi nd  my little boy. 
Q: What happened 
to your da ughter?  
A: To my little girl?  She died.  Sh

or mo ney, whate v er 
it is.  But the main thing it is that
 the y wa nt to ha ve , you know - -  fo

and to go and to sell it to the people and bring 
for the pe ople who ne eds t h
e  food.  And now we ha d 
enough food for a c oupl e days , pr obably, enough brea d and so on.  I stopped tal king about the

didn™t care.  Let them sh

 As long I am alive, I™ll 
try to have something,  
the mai n thi ng was , you see, my Ja

  She had a package.  Th
at wa s wr ong.  Tha t  was

to call up to get dr
e sse d a n d get out  and ta ke the m in a  s pecial  place , spe cia l 
fie l d.  Cold, bitter c old, t o test what t he people
 gonna do.  Having my little
 boy, befor e you dre ssed 
hi m -- here you c oul dn™t  see here in t he clot hes.  I 
used to put up everyt hing in his little bed that he 
use d to be --  put up e ver ythi ng t hat i n the morni

 eighteen or ni net een, maybe more
.  Pe opl e there were sleepi ng on  
the floors.  The r e was no be ds, no sofas.  But at
 least we ha d a pillow. 
 And we ha d, you know, a 
_______, whatever .  I t ™s - -
 who can de scribe the horrible t hings 
in the ghettos.  
No ink c a n write , no 
write r can write up what we had to do duri ng t he thr

that it was to me , as I  
told you, t ha t  was  my pe ople  there .  
Q: Let me  ask you two que
stions , oka y?   You okay? 
A: Yes .  

Q: When you were living in the 
ghetto, did you s
till have Chabas (ph)?  Di
d you still celebrate the 
holi days?  

A: The hol idays? 

Q: M m-h m.  Coul d you practice  your  re
ligion while you were
 in the ghetto? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
24 
 
A: Yea h, we  use d to have the holi da y s.  But eac
h holi day, whe n it us ed t o
 come , the Gestapo gave  
you ri ght  a w ay a  holi day -- 
taking people, sending them
 to the Ninth Fort, to ki ll the people there, to 
take off t hei r bodies from 
t he . . . fr om the  ca ve s.  We  ne ver  ha
d a holiday that we should enjoy.  
Because each holiday, when it used 
to come, always used to be b
itter because they used -- they  
always gave you such a ro
ugh time.  Used to take 
our peoples, they
 used to kill th
e people, they 
use d to hang the people. Hone y, I cannot tell you, just 
in the three hours, what they did.  Before they  
went to the airport, they took
 2,000 peopl e -- and it was Rosh Ho
sa nna -- a nd s o me pe ople di dn™ t  
want to go because it was 
the holidays.  And what  
do you think they 
did?  They kille
d t hem.  They 
killed them to show
 them that you must go to
 work, it™s no holidays. 
 So you asked me about 
holidays -- each holiday, no ma
tter what, when used to
 come, always was bitter,
 full with tears, full 
of fear , full of pai n.  
You cannot des cribe , even 
i n Yi ddi sh, whi c h I know 
s o good, I  wouldn™t be  
able to describe it.  But I went
 thr ough, and s o ma ny pe ople  went t h
rough.  But, I 
was fortunatel y 
lucky.  I  a m alive .  There  have
 bee n ot her pe ople  --  no more. 
Q: Let me ask you a little more about
 the ghetto life .  Were there 
-- other than your working, were 
there other activities going on in th
e ghetto?  We re there -- was th
at -- how did th
e children go t o  
school?  

A: I t hink t h e children -- ac
tiviti es t here was, but  for t he chil dr en, 
they us e d t o have  s c hool.  That ™s 
what they had, but  the y didn™t know
.  It was a ll s ecretl y, you see?  
 But t h ey used to have for t he 
childr en a sc hool.  And i t  wa s teac he rs, a nd t hat 
wa s, but t he y di dn™t know.  The Ges t apo didn™t  
know.  But we had activitie
s -- I don™t remember, I do
n™t know.  Because you se
e, I was a slave.  I  
wa s a sla ve .  I use d to go out 
i n the morni ng, come back, see ev
er ybody™s  oka y.  Tire d.  Thi nki ng  
what tomorrow will 
be.  Will you have to get up early in the morning -- 4:
00.  So, I don™t know too 
much about the activities, I™
m honest with you.  But I 
know that they have a sc
hool for the children .

you s ay it -- the Gesta po didn™t come near to the gh

it us ed to c o me  to se lecti on, t h
e fi rst thing was 
the Gestapo.   
Q: The Gest apo ran t he selection. 

A: The Ge s t apo use d to come in 
t h e ghet t o, oh yeah.  The y use d to c o me int o the ghet t o.  I  
remember one t hing t hat  had happen

Q: Did you move around a lot or  did you 
stay in one place the whole time? 
A: Oh, no.  You have to move.  Right now, I™m comi ng -- can I say? 

Q: Please. 

A: So then, he told us, he  said, 
ﬁGet all together in one place, th
at it should look like a big rock.ﬂ 
He hims elf, I shall never forget, got down on 
the ground, and lay down and he said, ﬁThey are 
comi ng.ﬂ  It means the German police -- I don™t k
now who it was.  After everything was over, he 
said to me , ﬁYou know, where should I take you? ﬂ
  I told him, ﬁYou know?   Take me  to 
Pashkovski (ph).ﬂ  He said, ﬁOka

anything to them that I brought 
you.ﬂ  I said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ  He brought us there and he  was waiting until we go inside.  We  got in 

there and knocked on the door.  The dogs was bark
ing and barking and barking and barking and I 
didn™t know what it was.  And I knocked on the door. 
 He got back.  He got scared when he™s up 
seeing me  (ph).  I said, ﬁDon™t get scared.  Do 
you know Heika (ph)?ﬂ  That™s the way they used 
to call her.  ﬁYes.ﬂ   I said, ﬁI™m Heika™s (p

brought you here?   What you got here

said, ﬁPlease let me  in.ﬂ  He looked at me

BUt I told him to remi nd him, ﬁYou don™t reme
mber me, but you reme mber my mother.  Do you 
reme mber when -- Mrs. Preskovski (ph) -- when 
she worked there, in hospital, you know, my 
mother, the way I told you, my mother used to 
cook and come  to be with them and give them 
some  food a nd so on.ﬂ  He said, ﬁYes, it™s true
.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁYou used to come  to our house 
with the horses and buggy.ﬂ  He said, ﬁYes.  Ah-h
a.  So you are Heika™s (ph) daughter.ﬂ  I said, 
ﬁYes.  And that is my husband.  And that is my so
n.ﬂ  I said, ﬁPlease let me  in for a couple days 
until I get in contact with my uncle.ﬂ  And my un
cle told all the farmers where he is and where 
he is located -- not all 
of them, but a few of the m., like that
 Martinez (ph).  He knew everything.  
And he said, ﬁLet me  tell you some thingﬂ -- All to
 the farmers . . . ﬁIf you want to get me  out,ﬂ 
he said, ﬁlet me  tell you one thing.  Not one of you will be left alive.
ﬂ  Because it was not 
allowed to keep Jewish pe ople.  So he  was in 
82 places.  Each time in another pl ace, each time .  
The way people running from one place to the other.
  So, when it happened, that case.  And he 
let us st ay until -- I think six days or seven. 
 And he starts looking around, why the dogs was 
barking.  Why the dogs was barking.  Some thing 
was wrong in their house.  He said, ﬁI cannot 
keep you anymore.ﬂ  I said, ﬁPut us in the pota
toes bin,ﬂ you know, where the yeast is.  Nothing 
doing.  He got in contact with my uncle.  And 
my uncle took us to another place.  To _______.  
And by working over there, we were worki
ng -- I don™t know, a good while -- until we came to 
that farm.  And poor farmer, very poor farmer, 
but very good people.  Very good people.  They 

share with us whatever they had.  And my uncle 
used to come  every week and to bring us some  
bread, milk for my -- for Jay.  And so on, because they didn™t have anything.  They didn™t have a 

cow. They got only one pig, or two, and two sheeps
.  When we came there, my uncle came.  And 
he said, ﬁHere is that place.  Try to be as l
ong as you can.ﬂ  And the farme r s, already, was afraid, 
that in case somebody will gi ve him out.  So all 
the farmers will get killed.  So they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
35 
 
watching already.  You see, they was watchi
ng -- they was watching him t hat nobody should 
give him out, in case or now they™re
 all in trouble.  He came over there.  And my uncle used to 
come  there.  But we have to have a hi ding pl
ace.  Because we heard th
at, you see, the Germans 
are losing.  And that, to make a hiding place to
 be was impossible.  
And what had happened, 
there was two potato pits.  And 
my husband ma de out a grave, and he ma de a tunnel to go in 
fr om one to the other.  And it was no air to breath
e.  He made just a little bitty hole, that  even 
you couldn™t ma tch up a light, a ma tch to light up.  
We  were there for nine months.  The rest of 
my tale is the truth.  Wh atever
 had happened with my husband, he can tell you tomorrow.  I fear 
not the Liberation.  We  didn™t have no 
clothes, no nothi
ng.  Darling . . . 
Q: How did you live in that hole for so long? 

A: How did -- it wasn™t only us. 
 It my uncle.  He had  two ch
ildren, his wife, his sister-in-law 
with a child.  And other people came in, you know. 
 We had maybe about 20 
people hiding there.  
You couldn™t work, you couldn™t _______.  We  we
re like dead people on the floor.  You 
couldn™t stand.  And at night, when it was already 
dark, when they used to go out and catch fresh 
air.  We  were there for nine or
 eight months in
 that grave. 
Q: How did you get food? 

A: It is a question.  No clothes we ha
ve to wash.  I™m asking the same  thing. 
Q: Did you eat? 

A: Yeah, my uncle used to bri
ng some  things, you know, food?    

Q: He would come  and go? 

A: Oh, yes.  He used to come  at night, about 10:00, when it used to get dark.  So he used to come  

at night.  He used to be with us for three hours,
 four hours.  And that poor fellow used to go back 

to his place. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358

Q: So the people hiding with you, 
there was different relatives. 
A: Yes.  You see, that was the farmers, the way 
I told you, that my uncle used to live in peace 
with them.  He used to he lp them a whole lot.  
And my grandmother, shall 
she rest  in peace, she 
used to help them, too.  And that what they
 liked.  ___________, in Lithuani
an.  And that™s why 
they liked him, and that™s why they helped him to survive.  It™s unbelievable. 
Q: What did you do all day? 

A: All day?   Now I can tell you what I was doing
.  I didn™t know what 
to do.  I didn™t know.  I 
was writing some thing.  One day, she came 
in, _________, came in.  And she said, ﬁDo you 
know how to sew? ﬂ  I said, ﬁYes, I 
do.ﬂ  SHe said, ﬁLook, I want to ma
ke Pearl (ph).ﬂ   ﬁBut that 
is name d for  a son, Jacob.ﬂ  I said, ﬁSure, you can
 show me  what you like to do, I™ll help you.ﬂ  
So, she gave me  a needle and 
thread.  And I know how to put
 the _______, not like here.  But, 
the farmers, as long as you got to sleep and a jack
et in that heat, and I wa
s sewing there.  And all 
of a sudden, she shout through the window, she 
got company.  Oh, my
 goodness, that was 
horrible.  Where should I go?   I said, ﬁPut me  
some where.ﬂ  She said, ﬁCome on.ﬂ  She put me 
between, you know, the beets (ph).  And I was hiding 
there, I was sitting there for four hours.  I 
don™t know, there™s so many things to tell you about. 

Q: Now, on a norma l day, when you were in -- 

A: On a norma l day, we used to sit -- oy -- well, you keep, you know, the corn, and when you -- 

and hay and so on in the bottom.  We  used to be
 there.  As long we had, you know, the corn put 
it up, you know, hay, we used to be on top.  Then
, it start comi ng up lower and lower and lower.  
And it was no place left to go.  That was the last 
place, take it or leave it, like some body said.  
And my hus band said they were looking there a
nd said, ﬁYou know, ma ybe the potato peaks (ph)

will be just right because one wasn™t far from th
e other.  And he built 
up a place that, like, he 
would be engineer.  And we had children with
 us.  Four children.  It™s time to go, huh? 
Q: No. 
A: And we had four children, 
and the children, you see, he ma
de a tunnel.  We  didn™t have 
nothing.  No wood, no nothing had to support.  
I don™t know.  The good Lord ma ybe s a ved our 
lives, by going from one  ______ to the tunnel, a
nd not having no support, whatsoever, fall down 
and you can, you know, get killed.  So that saved our 
life.  And we used to
 go out only at night. 
Q: So during the day . . . 

A: So during the day, they used to be th
ere like I told you.  Y
ou didn™t do nothing. 
Q: Now wha t  would happen if the ki
ds started crying or somebody got sick. 
A: Well, it was really a problem.  It was really
 a problem.  I reme mber, Jay took sick with his 
gums.  It was terrible.  But you wouldn™t believe 
it.  So what you did, th
e lady, Proskovski (ph), 
she took onions and garlic and she used to rub 
him, you know.  The teeth, it was swelled up, the 
gums and everything.  And a little at a time, it star
t healing up.  I was sick
 that they wanted to 
take me  back to the ghetto.  The ghetto still was 
running.  And I was sick and they want to try to 
take me  to a doctor.  The way I you, that I l

used to take him out to help to bring the 
corn for the bread.  He

Q: Now, wa s it difficult to know who you 
could trust, who you could not trust? 
A: It is, sure, difficult.  But you see, as long as
 I have my unc le, wasn™t difficult, because he 
knew the people.  And he knew that he can trust 
the people.  And he was beloved by the people.  

They liked hi m because he helped them.  I f he would be a bad far mer, that farm woul d be

Q: But how did you know you were free? 

A: Huh?  

Q: How did you know that you we
re free?   What happened? 
A: What had happened the -- _______.  When th
e war was over, the Russians came in, in 
Lithuania.  Earlier, when the war was end.  You 
see?   SO we got out, I think with six months 
earlier, or  seven months, until the war was to the end. 

Q: When we re you liberated, do you reme mber? 
A: When I was liberated?   1944 between June or July. 
Q: And did the soldiers come  through

against the governme nt,ﬂ or some thing.  It was not

terrible. 
Q: Okay, just a mi nute.  Just a mi nute.  When

And it wasn™t too far from the house where we us

Q: Must have been exciting, yes? 

A: Yes it was exciteme nt, but exciteme nt with fe ar

not say anymore.  I hope I could -- I hoped always
 I was living this for . . . ma ybe I go see my 

people back.  But I never did.  And that was rea
lly again, perhaps you, too. Pray in full.  You 
couldn™t run away from yourself.  Everything you ev

forget.  No ma tter how long you going to live.  Never forget.  Now, I can™t forget what had

A: When I came to the ghetto, I had seen burned 
up bodies, children™s feet, shoes.  People killed.  
They were killed because they was in a bunker.  And they find out, so they burn them up.  I 

cannot talk to _______.  It™s such bad me mories. 
 The crowd . . . I said, ﬁNot that, ________ﬂ  
Such bad memories.  A crowd of people, you know
?   Children™s hands, child
ren™s feet, with the 
shoes on.  Some  bodies were bur
ned up if you didn™t know whose shoes.  Some  of them were 
killed, shot.  That™s what we find out in the ghetto
.  That -- could these hurt
 -- the pictures, right 
now infor med us (ph).  You wouldn™t believe it, 
but we had fear after 
the Liberation.  It is 
unbelievable, unbelievable what they did.  You 
see, some  people had their bunker (ph) -- you 
know what the bunker(ph) is?   Twenty people, 15 pe
ople -- they were hiding.  And some  of the m 
-- I don™t know how you tell them, 
how they get out -- that here is 
the bunkers.  So what they did, 
some  of them got out and they killed them.  Some of them, they put up fire and they burned them 

up.  It was horrible.  It was bi
tter.  It is -- you can
not describe -- you canno
t describe the place, 
what we have seen and what they did to the Je
wish people, to the Jewish _____.  But they came  
in there to see blood all over, li
ke in a slaughterhouse.  It™s 
hard, honey.  It™s hard to tell you, 
these people could be so viol
ent.  And ma ybe worse -- and 
maybe my hus band™s people were 
there, too. 

Q: We re there any living
 people when you went in? 
A: Huh?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
44 
 
Q: Were there any people alive still when you went in? 
A: NOthing.  No people alive, nothing.  It was alr
eady slaughtered out.  I d
on™t know, it™s -- it is 
unbelievable, unbelievable what was going on.   

Q: Did you stay?   Did you 
leave?   What did you do? 
A: We  couldn™t do nothing.  We  went.  We  didn™
t go _____ to Slovat (ph).  And we got in, back 
to Kovno.  In Kovno, there was my husband™s fri
end, a lawyer, a Kirsch (ph).  ________.  And 

they took over there, the _______.  And then, my 
husband got in in a littl
e factory where they 
used to ma ke candies.  So they put him up as a -- 
he was taking care, he wa s there -- the leader.  
And that the way we started up.  And then, I used 
to go sell to the farmers sewing ma c hines.  Oh, 
honey, it™s _______.  It™s so ma ny things what I did 
in my life.  After the Liberation, I used to 
sell them to the farmers -- sewing ma chines -- and on the way back, I used to get money.  ANd 

you know, some times a pig, an already slaughter -- and 
more things than I used to bring back in 
Kovno, counties (ph).  And I used to sell them, a
nd I used to ma ke some money.  It happened 
that I lived there.  I have a girl, but she used 
to take here and collect
, you know, some  money.  It 
was the . . . 

Q: Did the . . .

 Used to sell them, get 
some , beg some -- like I 
said, pigs or a cow or some th

me .  

Q: Did the Christian people, when 
you came ba ck, did they welcome you? 
A: Huh?  

Q: The Lithuanian people, when you returned . . . 

A: Yeah -- oh, they welcomed?  Nah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
45 
 
Q: How did they treat you? 
A: It was no place.  I tell you some thing.  It
 was no harmony anymore between the Lithuanian 
people and our people, because we know that they 
are murderers.  Wherever they can find a Jew, 

they used to kill them to take to the Gestapo.  
I ne ver coul d be lieve  that years, years ago, when I 
used to come  to my grandmother, to the farm and be with them, everything was open wide.  

Nobody did bother you.  BUt since th
e Lithuanians start 
killing the people -- no ma tter whatever 
they found -- they killed them.  They didn™
t save their life, but
 they killed them. 
Q: So how did you -- when you went back, did you -- 

A: I did, I came back where my husband was known, and he was a lawyer there.  And then, he 

see -- he knew some  people, some  good people, 
you know.  Letto (ph) was a new daddy, George 
(ph), he knew the other people. And how he said he
 raised a living, it was very hard, very, very 

hard.  That™s what I told you.  I was taking f
ood and running there to the farmers and selling 
them different things, what they needed. 
Q: Wa s Jay in school?  Did he go to school? 
A: Jay?    No, that™s another point.  Jay, I think, we
nt to school just for a 
year, and then they run 
away.  They have to run away because  our li
fe was very dangerous -- ve ry, very dangerous 
because of the communists.  My husband will tell you more. 

Q: You don™t want to tell me? 

A: He™ll tell you the same
 story a little bigger. 
Q: Okay, why was it so dangerous with the communists? 

A: What you said -- you said WHy?  

Q: Why so dangerous with the communists? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
46 
 
A: Why so dangerous?  You don™t know the communist
 life.  You don™t know.  I couldn™t believe 
either.  I couldn™t believe -- because it™s impossible.
  It wasn™t the ma rket share anymore like it 
was. And they believe on ________, eleven.  There was a Ge orge (ph) , a military (ph) , and -- I 
don™t know.  It™s so ma ny things, honey. 

Q: Are you tired?   Do you wa
nt to take a little break? 
A: I -- 

Q: Do you want to take a break? 

A: Yeah.  It™s already 5:00. 

Q: We ™ll just stop there . . . 

A: Honey, I tell you something. . . . 

Q: After the war, when you were in Kovno, and 
the Communists were in charge, could you be 
Jewish?   Could you practi
ce your religion?  Could you 
observe the holidays? 
A: Oh, yes.  That you could do it.  They didn™t -- 
they wasn™t against you.  But they were against 
-- they didn™t have any democracy the way we have
 here.  There, everything that you used to do 
is under the governme nt.  Here, democracy means 
you can do what it please you.  You can build 
what you want.  You can build a business and ma ke money.  Pay the tax, the governme nt 

wouldn™t bother you.  And you gradually start gr
owing and growing and growing, if you are not 
lazy.  If you work, you make.  You don™t work, you 
don™t ma ke.  Over there, it™s no democracy.  
You ask me  right now about the Communis m.  I di
dn™t want to say anything, but I™ll have to 
bring up and to tell you what had happened, why we
 have to run away.  As you know, I was in 
business.  I didn™t know that much (ph) about th
e Communism.  In our place, where we used to 
live, was a George (ph) from the marines (ph)
.  It was a captain ove
r the eight ________.  You 
know, you heard about _________.  They were r
ough and tough.  The way I used to buy the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
47 
 
machines and different things -- and a knitti
ng machine -- some body wa nt
 to have a knitting 
machine.  And I found some body who had a good knitting machine.  And a machine that you 
don™t have to buy the merchandise, you know, 
but you can ma ke your own wool, you know.  
Okay, they got that ma c hine, and the ma n gave 
us some  money.  And my 
uncle was there, st ill 
on the farm.  And what he gave me  was a hog, 
you know, a cow, a life, 
and some  money -- and 
some  different, you know, food I couldn™t reme mber. 
 I had potatoes and flour and so on.  But as 
(ph) I™m comi ng back, the girls from concentration camp was alive.  But they come  back, they 

didn™t find no children, no husband, no nobody.  So where they used to come ?   To the Ipps, you 

know -- in Lithuanian, Ipp-es.  What I did, I didn™
t have too much at that time.  So I had the 
potatoes, the potatoes and bread.  And I had a bi
g kettle.  Put it up, peeled the potatoes with 
onion, pepper -- and it smells, it was so good -- and 
bread -- and I was feeding them with that.  
What had happened to me at that time -- when I got 
that cow, in that place where we used to live 
__________, there was the officer and the George (
ph).  And more, you know, from t hem.  We 
took that cow in the ________, and we slaughtered 
it.  And we -- like in
 a butcher shop -- we 
forgot to clean up the place.  What had happened, 
all of a sudden that officer has to come  down, 
and he had seen what he take.  And he came to
 me, and he said, ﬁDo 
you know, because I respect 
your husband --ﬂ  I said, ﬁThat w
ould change you? ﬂ   And he said 
he could send me  out (ph) for 
hard labor for five years.  What he did.  
I said, ﬁ________ (even though it was his name ), I don™t 
know.  I have been living in a demo cracy coun
try, you can do whatever it please -- you can do 
whatever is good.ﬂ  I said, ﬁ We will take it out 
right away and we go clean it up.ﬂ  I think my 
husband wasn™t at that time at home .  They send him,
 I think to Beluge (ph), in Lithuania.  And I 
said, ﬁPlease, don™t me ntion it.  Don™t bring any ha
rm to us.  Hitler didn™t kill us.  Pl ease.ﬂ  And 
he used to come .  I used to ma ke the _______, di
fferent things, the Russian food.  But I could 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
48 
 
tell, and he was burning.  But we got right 
away a person who came in and cleaned it up and 
gave them away everything that was there left.  
And he cleaned up and it was beautiful.  He said, 
ﬁDon™t you know that that 
is not allowed in Russian to do
?ﬂ  I said, ﬁ_______  law (ph), how 
should I --ﬂ (You couldn™t ca
ll them _______, you couldn™t call th
em ________.)  I said, ﬁHow 
should I know?   Please reme mber one thing.  We  ar
e raised in a democracy country.ﬂ  I said, ﬁDo 
you see, I don™t have any clothes.  I want to ge t some thing to put on for me.  You see my coat?   

What I was wearing is here with holes in my elbow
s.ﬂ  I said, ﬁI have to do some thing.  This is 
not ma king anything.  I even don™t 
have any coal to heat up the apartment.ﬂ  I said, ﬁPlease 
understand.  Right now, I see the regulations, ﬁ I 
said, ﬁfrom the Russian governme nt.  If you 
could teach me  more, a little about that life, I promise you, I go follow exactly what you go say.ﬂ  

And I was crying.  I was strong, but I start cryi
ng because I was afraid 
for Jay.  And now it™s 
easy to have respect, you know.  But that part
icular _____ Siberian (ph)
 -- where would be my 
little Jay?   And then I have more children who ha
d lost their mothers.  
And I kept them in my 
place.  I had about four.  He said, ﬁOkay.  I wi
ll tell you what you can do.ﬂ  I said, ﬁWhat can I 

do to make a living? ﬂ  I said, ﬁCan I bake a
nd sell, you know, some  little cakes, you know.ﬂ  He 
said, ﬁYes, you can do it.ﬂ 
 We  ma de a little kitchen -- a stove
, a little stove.  And the wood was 
so big, like that.  And in that littl
e stove, I used to bake and make
 cookies.  Different things.  And 
then I used to take that to the 
lady that runs the restaurant.  And 
she used to sell them, and I was 
ma king a little money.  When ______ came back, he 
told him the whole history, the way I did.  
Finally, we became good friends.  And I told him, 
I said, ﬁI go follow all the inst ructions.  But 
you will tell (ph).ﬂ  And that is no monkey busin
ess with them.  They can se nd you away that 
you don™t know where you are.  And they can 
-- you don™t know what you are anymore.  And 
that was the life of them.  Siberi
a.  It came to a mome nt, that wa
s enough.  It was no life.  It was -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
49 
 
- no life.  I don™t know, it™s come  back, ma ybe 
about 100 people, or 200 people.  Jay was -- at 
that time, he was going to school.  Th
ey had the school 
for the children. 
Q: A Jewish school.  A Jewish school? 
A: Yiddish.  Yes, a Yiddish sc
hool.  And he was going there with some  people who survived, 
you know, the way we did survive.  _________.  
It™s _______ mo me nt.  The day my husband 
told me  about the cookies and the candies.  Th
at some body called my husband that he™s against 
the governme nt.  And they have to see outside
, on the ______, you know, that they have to do 

some thing to send him away in Siberia or to puni
sh him, wha t ever he was doing.  ANd that was 

already bitter.  That was alrea
dy bad.  That was before, but I 
want to say something else.  I 
couldn™t handle any more.  I couldn™t produce an
y more.  The cookies was no life -- to stay and 
to cook all day, and then to sell it to ma ke nothi
ng.  Finally, I sold the house that we had.  And I 
ran back to the George (ph).  And I had the --
 I knew some  people who want to sell the house, 
and they need some  money to go in a __________. 
 It™s a pity-case or something, you know.  
And I help them.  But with the help, I shouldn™t 
do it.  Because if they would caught me , they 
would send me  to Siberia anyhow.  My husband kne
w that the George (ph).  And he introduced 
me  to hi m.  When he introduced me  to him, I became a lawyer.  I start doing the papers, you 

know, to sell the papers.  A thousand in one nigh
t.  That™s the way I wa
nt to tell you.  And I 
became -- I used to sell the house.  I didn™t have
 no trouble.  I had the 
secretary.  She knew me  
already. I had the people who want to buy.  And 
a happy people who wants the money to get out 

from Kovno to go into free world.  So i made mo ne
y.  The truth.  I ma de money, I didn™t have to 
work hard.  But, each time I used to have some thing 
else to wear.  I didn™t wear the same clothes.  
[Crying]  Everything that I was doing was fear. 
 Fear and painful.  We
 ma de some mo ney.  I 
made it.  And it came the mo ment where we have 
to leave everything that again I had.  And on

our way, 12:00 at night.  To ma ke a long story 
short, I ran, not to th
e door, but I open up a 
window and jumped out of the window -- jumped out with Jay through the window.  In the back 
yard, was there a ________ truck, y
ou know?   And he took us to vendors (ph).  Between three 
and four mo nths, it took us to get 
in Berlin.  And from Berlin, we
 got in in the American zone 
(ph).  Four months, I forgot my na me.  Jay sai
d, ﬁI don™t know what™s my name .ﬂ  That™s another 
thing -- cannot go on the same name each time.  E
ach time, wherever we  went, it was no flowers.  
They took out my husba nd from the train.  We  di dn™t _______ know about it.  But they took my 

husband because he was wearing boots
.  And all of a sudden, they have seen that he got a watch.  
I thought it™s the end.  But he said, ﬁLet me  go.  
You want my boots?   Here are the boots.  In 
another place, you™ve got your watch.  Let us go 
out.ﬂ  We  ha d been in Nobody™s Land for four 
or five days.  Snow, bitter cold.  Jay got sick. 
 It is just unbelievable, unbelievabl e what people 
can go through -- ma ybe because I was younger.  Well, to ma ke a long stor y short, it wa s in 

Munich, and they had there, my hus band had a job.  Then I want to come to America to see my 
sister and my aunt that was my 
mot her™s si ster.  I wrote them a 
letter that  I want to come to 
America and I need your help.  
Didn™t took no time .  And I told
 them I don™t want to be any 
more on the bloody  earth.  And we got the papers. 
 I didn™t know what to do, which way to turn 
and which way to go.  In Israel, you couldn™t go b
ecause it™s no place with no certificate.   So, 
finally, when we came here, people were warm
, people were nice.  But I didn™t have the 
language.  I didn™t know nothing.  
And my husband has to start out life from the beginning.

Tape 4 
Q: I think I told you what it™s like in [Munich
].  Life in [Munich] was when you had seen the 
people, what you thought they already did.  And all of
 us hadn™t yet seen them.  Survivors.  It™s 
moment that I think, there I am.  In seventh heav
en?   Or in another world?   Or I™m dreaming.  
You can™t tell reality.  It is to describe you 
mo me nts like that -- the 
other people thought the 
same  way.  Oy, you thought that you are dead.  You are 
alive.  I said, Yes, I am here.  It is things 
that you couldn™t believe.  You couldn™t be
lieve and you see some  friends -- _________, that 
they are still come  out fr om the ghettos, from th
e concentration camps.  You feel like one fa mily.  
That™s the way you felt when you have me t the peopl
e from the concentration camps.  We were 
looking at each other and saying, ﬁIs 
that the truth? ﬂ  We  are still 
alive.  We couldn™t believe our 
own self anymore.  And then we used to get 
together once in a while with some  people, you 
know, whom we knew.  They used to be in the -- wh
at you call it -- in other 
places, just like this.  
It™s unbelievable.  It™s really 
unbelievable.  Tears from happiness that the people are alive.  What 
you used to talking to people.  What you used to
 do in Munich.  In Munich,  it was only one 
thing.  How did you survive?   How did you survive in
 places like that -- lik
e in the concentration 
camps.  No food, lice, no showers, no bread.  
And that was the ma in talk, about that.  You 
couldn™t talk about some thing else, but each time, ﬁ What happened to you?  How did you 

survive?   What happened to them? ﬂ   And ever
ybody used to tell you the biography of the war, 
the concentration camps, of the lif
e, what they had there.  And I 
know -- we were in the ghettos.  
It was the same  thing, but not so horribly, like 
in the concentration camps.  So fortunately, we 
were in ghetto.  So that was the life in Munich. 

Q: We re you surprised by what you learned? 

A: Huh?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
52 
 
Q: We re you surprised to learn about the camps?  
A: I wasn™t surprised to know what was going on 
there.  We  knew already, in the ghettos.  But 
when the girls come  back, you know, and we were on the train and in Kovno, they used to tell us 

everything.  And I know what life 
was, and i know what my life was.  So when we we re in 
Munich, it™s no idle question.  Just to go -- just 
to talk about the passing 
time from your life and 
now to look forward for your future.  And we didn™
t want to stay anymor
e in Munich.  It was 
enough.  I couldn™t.  Each day was for me  horribl
e.  We  used to hear Germans ma rching and 
back.  And some times, she used to get in a fight w
ith the Nazi s.  So the only place it was, to go 
to America. 

Q: How long were you in Munich? 

A: How long in Munich?   From 1945 -- about thr
ee years, I would say, cl
ose to three years. 
Q: We re you working there? 

A: I didn™t work there.  My husband was working. 
Q: You were not in the deporting _______. 
A: No, I wasn™t involved because I said Jay has 
to go to school, have to take  him to school and 
he come s back.  And I wasn™t involved in anythi
ng.  Just to watch out that there should be 
something to eat.  

Q: We re there schools for the Jewish people there? 

A: Where? 

Q: In Munich, for the displaced persons? 

A: Oh, it was a whole lot people in Munich, but 
it was a whole lot in the camps, you know.  The 

______ camps. 

Q: Wa s your husband working with those people? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
53 
 
A: Oh, yes.  He was the transport , later, of 
all the trucks, and the car
s, and to give everybody, 
you know, who™s comi ng in if they need a vehicl
e, to help them.  And he  had about, I don™t 
know, about 15 people, chauffeurs, you know, where you 
have to take them in different places, 
in Boslin (ph), and ______.  I 
don™t know, in different places, 
they used to have for the 
________, you know?   He was working and he helped 
them to give them some  trucks.  The 
people who want to -- not to wait for any papers
, but to go out without papers, and to fight, you 
know, to come  to Israel.  So the _______ used to ta
ke care of some  displaced people.  And he 

used give them the trucks and the gears (ph)  
and everythi ng.  He had 
a big position to do.  He 
can tell you more about it. 

Q: Okay.  When you came over to the United States, where did you land? 

A: What I learn? 

Q: No, where did you first come? 

A: The first stop was New York. 
Q: How did that feel?  WH
at were your impressions? 
A: How did I got here?   I had my brother -- I ha
d a brother, too.  He wa
s in Wa shington.  And 
my sister was in Richmo nd, and my aunt.  And 
by comi ng he re, to Richmond, the United Jewish 
Appeals, they used to have the people who help
ed you.  And I was afraid, with the job was that 
the neighbors, so nervous and accepting, they used to come  and tell me , ﬁ  Don™t get upset.  Take 

it easy.  Take it easy.ﬂ 

Q: What I want to know is, when 
you first arrived in New York -- 
A: From Ne w York. 

Q: No, no.  One mi nute. 

A: Let finish.  If not, I™ll forget.

Q: Okay. 
A: When I came to New York, my uncle in Phila

to eat.ﬂ  So he said, ﬁWell, it™

it happened.  So my unc le got in 
contact with Richmond.  My brot
her got in contact with Philadelphia.  And it was going around 

already for a whole day.  Telephone
 calls here and there and here
 and there.  And finally, my 
uncle came from Philadelphia.  And my brothe

picture -- that day, I was sitt

up my eyes and I recognized my brother.  
And when I have seen him, he said, ﬁEdna, pleas
e.  You choking me  up.  Let me  loose.  Let me  
go away.ﬂ  And then, we are going to Richmond.  My brother told me , ﬁI will take care.ﬂ  He 

said they found that they had to 
come  to America, then they™ll 
find that they had to come  to 
Richmond.  He™ll go to Washington, Uncle Bennish
 (ph), may he rest in peace, he went to 
Philadelphia.  And we came to Richmond.  
And it is a __________, a life from the beginning.  
Seeing people -- my sister.  I di
dn™t know my aunt.  Her name 
was Bessie.  I think I found the 
biggest diamond in the world -- having a family. 
 I lost my family, as you know.  But I found 
another family.  They were so nice to us.  They
 were so good to us.  Alright, I didn™t know the 
language.  None of us knew the language.  Bu t Jay was young, and he picked up the language in 

no time, just like that.  You had to see it (ph) to 
ma ke a living.  We  were resting for a week.  And 
he said, ﬁYou know, Edna, I wouldn™t go to college
 back.  I wouldn™t study any more  law.ﬂ  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0358  
55 
 
said, ﬁWhy?ﬂ  He said, ﬁAnd I love law.ﬂ He said 
he had to be born here.  You had to learn the 
language fluently.  ﬁI cannot take
 it anymore, to be a lawyer he
re, and to waste my time and not 
to be successful.ﬂ  So what had happene
d, he said, ﬁYou know why?   I think we go up ______ 
station.ﬂ  I looked at him.  He said, ﬁIt 
wouldn™t be for long.ﬂ  So we opened up a ________ 
station.  I couldn™t stay ho me .  The doctor told me
 to get out from the house because I could lose 
my mi nd.  I was by myself.  And he told him, ﬁTak
e her out from the house, no ma tter what it is.  
She should meet the public, she should meet the people.ﬂ  And it was true.  I me t people.  I was 

there in the station.  I was pumping gas.  I was talki
ng to the people.  I do it, all the work, what in 
a service station has to be done.  And the peopl
e didn™t come, you know, for a whole lot gas, like 
ten gallons, 15 gallons.  They used to come , ﬁOh,  two gallons.  A dollar, a dollar and eight.ﬂ  

And you have to do the work that they should 
come  back, you know, to clean the windshields 
and everything.  And this is the way that they came
 in.  And they came in and they said, ﬁI™d like 
to fill up, I think, with ga s.ﬂ Oh, I said that™s 
a kind person there.  Do you know what I did?  I 
didn™t know how to pump the gas.  So instead, to
 stop the nozzle from the gas -- it shouldn™t go 
in anymore because it was filled up -- I presse
d the nozzle, and the gas flew up ______.  We ll, I 
told my husband, I said, ﬁI™m not a service operator.

 language at that time, I didn™t know even how 
to say even ﬁthank you.ﬂ  Used to say, ﬁSank ye, sank ye.ﬂ 

Q: So you built a life here. 

A: And I was working hard.  But then, it wasn™t ha
rd.  It was so easy.  It was so wonderful.  I 
said, ﬁThe country, it™s so beautif

 said, ﬁI™m s orry to 
hear.ﬂ  I said, ﬁBut I am okay.ﬂ I wiped up my te

people me t each other and they observed me , the wa

ﬁThat woma n doesn™t have no problems whatsoever

 About the kind things.  
Deep in my heart, nobody can ta

Q: You feel at peace. 

A: That peace -- I tell you some thing -- that fr
eedom, who c a n describe to you the way I can 
describe democracy (ph).  Like, some body said to me

million dollar and go back . . .ﬂ I said, ﬁAnd if

Elizabeth and tell me  to go back, I will tell you, ‚K
eep that.  And I want my comfort here.™ I am a 
citizen already.ﬂ  After the citizen papers, when I got them.   

Q: Is there anything el
se you want to say? 
A: I don™t know.  It™s more things -- let™s fini
sh it -- there™s more things, you know, to do.  But, 
like I said, it™s a wonderful country.
