In September
 
1942, the ghetto was liquidated and its 
inhabitants, including m em bers of  David'sf am ily, were deported totheTreblinka killing center.  

T he arrow pointsto T reblinka.  David was taken to Pionki, an industrial complex thatproduced

>> Bill Benson: T hose Passover dishes hadbeen in yourf am ily f orhundredsof  years.
 
>> David Bayer:  Hundreds of  years. All antiques. They tookthe silverware.  Ever ything th
e y 
could. Even the sheets for the bed. Everything.  Tookeverything they needed. And they keep 
com ing back because the house was visible
.  I
t was closef rom  the church. It was a big house. 
 
W ehad abackyard wit h a shop. W eused tohave about25peopleworkin g f or us.  My father 

was selling the shoesall over Poland.
 
 
W e ll ,  
we came inoneday to the house. T
he Germ ans, they 
tookm eto workf or them .  Clean thetruck, take out the battery f rom the truck, which I never 
coulddo that becauseI never had the truck. W enever had cars inour home.  AndI struggled 
to take thebattery f rom undera truckout. They gave m e apair of pliers only.  I was cold.  It 
was Septem ber.  It was snowing, on the ground. I spilled the acidf rom the battery on topof  
m e a
nd made ahole
 
--
 
m y skin was vis ible.  I was cr ying.  And the Germ ans were laughing
 
a
ndtaking pictures.  I begged to gohom etochangem y clothes. They didn't letm e go. Finally 
it was dark until they let me go home.  Nof ood, no nothing.
 
 
T his was going onevery day.  One day they tookm y f ather.  
Cam e intothe house. " Let's go,"  with guns in their hands.  And m y fatherhad been working 
behind the church, covering ditches. My f ather and a lot of other people.  TheGermans were 
laughing andm aking fun of them.  My m other was hom e crying.  She askedm e, "
P
lease, 
exchange yourselff or your father."  T hat's what Idid. I went.  I motioned to m yf ather to sneak 

away, and I took hisplace. I could take it.  And then they let m e goagain.
 
 
T he n
 
they took m y uncle, m y father's brother. Andthis tim e it

was a big Gestapom an who treatedm y uncle very nicel y.  My uncl e was shining his shoes, 
cleaning his room , washing his laundry like a house boy.  Som y uncle asked the Gestapom an 
if  I could be exchanged for him . He agreed,andI went to work f or that German. He was a 
husky, big guy.  He was in charge of the whole area inm y town. 
 
 
T hey kicked out the police outof  the complex.  They tookover 
the whole area
:  f
arm s, cows, horses. This guy was
 
ver y good tom e.  He gave m ef oodevery 
tim e I go home in theevening.  Andalso I was translatingfor himf rom  Polish to Germ an a
nd 
Germ an to Polish.  And one day he putm eto a dungeon, inanother room which 
--
 
with an 
open door and steps going down. T here was a Polish young m an locked up there. He w
a s 
m aybe 18 or19 yearsold.  Young, handsome young man.  He askedm e to translatef orhim .  
T hey accused that boy of having a gun. T hey f indhim  sleeping inabarn. There was 
a  gun 
som ewhere hidden there
, a
nd the Germ ansf ind the gun.  And they accused him  thathehad 
the gun.  He keeps saying this was not his gun.  Hedidn't even know there was som ething like 

this over there.  He was cryin g.  He said
 
--
 
Ididn't know that boy.  He was notf rom m y 
hometow
n.  Must have beenf rom  somewhere else.  Maybethree,four days he was trying.  He 
said this was not his gun.
 
 
Oneday, I went down with him, with the Germ ans.  Germ an took 
a pistoland shot him .  T alked, talk, talk.  Hewould keep saying " It's notm y gun.
" 
 S
o he shot 
him . I had to pickhim up.  Another guy helped me bury him  in af ield.  He'sprobably still there.
 
And this was a good Germ an to me.  He could shootm efor nothing. 
 
 
So thenI stopped work over there. Hem oved somewhere else.

He wanted m e
 
to go with him . I was like
,  
I cannot go.  Ihad to work in an irrigation canal.You 
hadto work for the Germ ans.  If you don't work, they send you away to
 
who knows where
,  to
 
A u sch wit z 
or som ewhere.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to stop youfor am inute.  T here was an incidentthat you told me 
about. I thought it was with the sam eGestapo off icer involvin g the veterinarian.
 
>> David Bayer:  Yeah, Dr.
 
Gonszer.  Gestapo used to com e in. Peoplem akef un of him .  
Jewish people.  One day they brought ina group, maybe 10 or 15 old menand alsoone 
heavy
set guy.  I recognized him .  He was a doctor.  He was a veterinarian. He was nam ed 
D r.
 
Gonszer.  He was a Jew
,  
who in other towns we called him  assim ilated.  He was not 
religious.  He was alwa ys speaking Polish.
  
The Jewish people in Poland had two languages:  
Polish and Yiddish. T his m an only speak Polish.  His wif e isa dentist.  A doctor played tennis.  

Like high society.
 
 
T h is  Dr.
 
Gonszer said, 
ﬁS
o rry, I'm  n o t 
J
ewish, I'm  not Jewish.
ﬂ
  
But they know he was Jewish.  Somebody probably told them he was Jewish.  But he was not 
practicing no religion. And there was one Jewish m an carrying a bible, parchment, Holy Book 
of  Moses. T hey m adehim  dance in thef ire, aroundthef ire. And then they pulled itapart and 
throw it on thef ireandburned it. They m adeDr.
 
Gonsze
r dance, too.  He was too heavy
s e t 
and couldn't do it. He fell on thef ire afew tim es. 
 
 
T hen whenI walked out to see, they grabbed m e andm adem e 
dance around, too. Then my Gestapom an saw m e.  
He right away to
okm eaway.  He said, 

"T
his is m y man.  Don't bother him ."  Itoldhim  about Dr.
 
Gonszer
,  
thathe's a veterinarian.  So

the German came andtook thedoctor away f rom the group andputhim  inthe stables
, 
b
ecause he was a veterinarian, knew about horses and everything else.
 
 
In Auschwitz, you keep com ing back to work ever y day.  He 
cam e back maybe two tim es.  The third tim e he didn't com e backnom ore. What happened to 
him ? He andhis wif eand daughter comm it suicide. They cut theirveins.
  
His  wif e
,  
t he  
daughter was rapedby a bunch of Germans. So Dr.
 
Gonszer was gone. 
 
 
I still worked with that Gestapom an. Af ter that, whenhe left, I 
went to work f orthe canal.  But400 to500 young people were diggi ng a canal, 70
 
k ilom e te rs  
f rom my ho
m etown.  W hydigging the canal? T he Polish governm ent
,  
before the war
,  
starte d  
an irrigation canal becausethe big river in Polandoverf lows thef ields.  So the Germ ans 

continued that
, b
ut with Jewish labor.  A shovel.  No m achine, nothing. W ehave to di
g c an a l s .   
And they gave us a piece of bread, soup. T hat's all. 
 
 
Meantim e,they kicked us out from  our house.  All of the people 
who li ved outside the Jewish neighborhood had to move out toa ghetto.  About 8,000 people 

in a sm all area. W ehave got one room.  My fam ily got one room .  Icouldn't even
 
--
 
I slept on 
thef loor. I had no other placeto sleep.
 
 
T he Germ ans took everything a way. W eonly carry what we 
could carry.  Our m achinery, ever ything was takenaway.  T henf rom there
, 
I went to work in 
t
he canalevery m orning, early in them orning, came home late at night. And one day they 
don'ttell usI cannot go hom e
 
--
 
they tell us, I cannot go hom enomore.  I have to stay atthe 
canal. They builda barrack. W estay there.

W hat happened?T hey took m y whole fam ily, m y hom etown, 
andthey shipped it away to Treblinka. T hiswas Septem ber
 
27, 1942,m y birthday.  My 
birthday, Septem ber
 
27.  Andthis was 1942. They killed m y whole fam ily andall the people in 
m y town. W edidn't
 
believe they were going to kill us.  Nobody believed thatthey were going 
to kill all the people atonetim e. T hey would keep you working somewhere or som ething.  
Nobody believed. 
 
 
T hen I worked in the canal. And every day I slippedaway.  
W her e d i d  I  
go? To thef ieldsto lookfor potatoes. I went tof arm ers, beggedfor bread. And 
oneday when I cam eback to the canal,there was nobody near the canal working.  Only the 

shovels. W hathappened?  I m et thef arm er. He toldm e the Germ ans took everybody
 
a wa y .   
W here didthey take them ? T hef actories inPoland. 
 
 
I didn't know what to do.  I wenttoaf arm er Iknew.  He kept me 
for two days in his barn.  Andthen he toldme that som e people lef t m y hom etown in the 

ghetto, some Jewish people.  So I 
sa i d
, 
ﬁ
T a ke
 
me there.
ﬂ
  
So he arranged for me and he took 
m eto that town. T here was about 30 or40people lef t. T he Germ an lef tthem to cleanup.  

W hat do you mean clean up?  Takeeverything out of the houses.  And the Germans would
 
--
 
for thef arm ers.  Furniture, clothing, whatever.  8,000 people.  Something was lef t.  They sold 

ever ything, gi ve awa y ever ything. 
 
 
Andf rom there I went to Radom , abig city.  The Germ ans took 
ever ybody, cleaned it up, went to Radom .
 
>> Bill Benson:  One question. W hen you went back into the ghettoas they were cleaning it 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

11
 
outand you knew your fam ily were all gone, did you know what happened to your fam ily?
 
>> David Bayer:  No. W eknew they tookthem  away.  T hey shipped them east.  But we didn't 
know if  they tookthem  to an exterm ination. They usedto call it resettlement. You go and 
build houses and resettle.  But this was all lies.  If ind outabout that later.  Right there I didn't 
know. W edidn't believe that som ebody woul d kill peoplefor nothing.  So I wentto work in
 
a 
factory, Pionki. It wasa big complex in thef orest.  I knew it was there, but they build itbefore 

the war.  Abig, tremendousfactory.  T hey m ake powderf orbullets. And I went there to work.  
How did I go there? W hen the Germ ans came topick up young people in the ghetto, I 
volunteered.  But every tim e I volunteered, they didn't want to takem ebecauseI didn't have 
no suitcases. 
 
Ididn'thave nothing to carry.  Ijust had the clothesthat I was wearing.  They 
pushed m e away. 
 
 
One day, a few truc
ks, Germ ans, German soldiers, cam eand 
askedfor volunteers.  So there was a coupleof  elderly people, whic h they didn't want to take 

old people.  Only young people.  Cam e over to me. They knew m e. They knew m y parents.  
T hey said, 
ﬁ
Dave, here, two bundl
e s. ﬂ
  
T hey give it to m e. W hen I walkedover to the truckwith 
the two bundles, the Germ ans tookm e. AndI went to work at thefactory.
 
 
W hat happened whenI came to thefactory? T hey took away 
m y bundles. That's why they wantedbundles.  Every Je w had
 
money, gold, things like this.  
S
o they robbedm e. Inever knew what was i nsideanyhow.  So then I worked in thefactory.  I 
becam eanexpert inmaking powder. T he Germ anstaught me how to makepowderf or 

bullets.

For two years I was an expert. T here was sabotageover there, 
explosions,f ire.T here were things that we did that was unbelievable stories. But Idon't ha
ve  
m uch time to talkabout it, but I will tell you aboutone story.
 
 
T here was one guy who was a smoker.  For cigarettes, would 
gi ve awa y his rations,breads, everything f ora cigarette. And onenight, thenight shif t, hisjob 
was to takethe cotton, which we producedthe powder, putona conve yor
,  
and the conveyor 
was com ing tom y departm ent
,  
which Im ixed in with chem icals.  Hewas sm oking the 
ciga re tte
,  
f ell out of  his m outh
, 
and there wasaf ire. W hy did itfall out? Becausehe was so 
tired.  He worked12hours aday for him self andfor som ebody else who gi ve him  cigarettes.  

Bread or som
ething. He gave awa y his rationf or a cigarette. T hefire went tom y building.  
W estopped working.  T he Germ ans cam e in.  They're going to kill us. T hat's what they do.  

T hey killed you right awa y f or anything you do wrong.
 
 
T here were two Germ ans.  I have to mention their nam es.  One 
wa s  D r .
 
V it
ta, and onewas anotherdoctor. Two Germ an civilians charged in m y factory. T hey 
persuaded the Gestapo not to kill us because we are experts. We know what we are doing.  If 

they kill us, they have to trainother people
, 
and thefactory would not start working.  So they 
saved our lives. 
 

 
In the m eantim e, they
 
--
 
they beat usbloody.  The next day they 
s a id
,  ﬁG
o back to work.
ﬂ
  
So that's whathappened in the Pionki. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  David, two things.  First, thework that you did wasver y dangerous in the 
m unitionsfactory.  Buttell us,also, what yourlif e was like.  How didyou eat? W hat were the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
conditions like there? 
 
>> David Bayer:  Ok. W e worked with civilia ns, Polish people
,  
who were com ing to work in the 
factory andthen would go hom e.W e worked together next tothem .  ThePolish people 
brought their lunch, their f ood. And the Germans gave us only one ration.  In the morning they 
gave you bread. W hen you com ehom eat night, they give you soup.  Butnobody wants to 
keepthe bread because you're scared you wil l lose it
,  
somebody wi ll steal it. So youeat 
ever ything at one tim e.  The wholeday you're starving. 
 
 
But they also gave usclothing, clothing
 
f rom people who they 
k ille d  a
nd we didn'teven know.  Shoes, jackets. Thepeople who the Germ ans took away to 
kill.  So som etim es I got a good coat.  Ihavesold it to aPolish worker.  He gave me 
sandwiches, f ood.
  
And then I met a wom an who was working with the cotton.  She
, 
e ve r y 
once in a while
,  l
ef t me something.  Her lunch
,  
she lef tm e.  She said, "Ibring you something."   
Ever y day she brought m e som ething.  So this m ade strength in working
.  O
therwise we would 
fa ll a pa rt. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  David, you tried to escapef rom  Pionki. 
 
>> David Bayer:  I escaped, yeah.  I wouldn't have time to tell everything.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Noteverything, but tellaboutyour one attem pt to escape with the otherfellow. 
 
>> David Bayer:  Everybody wanted to escape all the tim e. I escaped twice.  One tim e I got 
sh o
t in the leg here.  And I was lying in the snow, pretending to be dead.  And they killed three 
other guys next tom e.
 
 
But onetime there was a guy.  He was a Pol,big guy.  His job 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

was to takeout the chem icalsf rom the tankers, to connect it to thebuilding.  He said he 
wanted to runaway.  
ﬁ
W e have a place here. W e can join the underground f ighters in the

W hen the Russians were pushing theGermans ba

Germ ans tried todismantle thef actory, take them achinery out, ship it to Germany. W e didn't 

go to work anym ore. W estayed in camp. And every once ina while a German with escort

was hiding under thebed. The camp was a trem endous,big camp. 2,000 people in that 
cam p. T he Germ ans grabbed whoever they could.
 
 
Oneday a goodGerman who I used to work with, engineer, a 
civi lian, a nice guy, hecam e in. W esaw him  walkin g in f rom  the gate. W hoever saw him  was 
running tohim .  Everybody was raising their hand, "
T
akem e! T ake m e!"  People were 
stampeding to him
 
becausehe was anice guy.  He pulleda pistol and shot in the crowd.  
Killed am an. This was a good Germ an.
 
 
I toldthat boy that,and theboy was like, 
ﬁ
I don't understand.  I'm  
going to have totalk to m y father.
ﬂ
  
Idon't understand to thisday myself !  Andhe was a good 
Germ an.  He said hello to you.  He said thankyou.  He was polite. He speaks to you.  He 

never hurt you,never kicked you.  He would only take careof  his job.  Sothis was go

Ge rm an . 
 
>> B ill

take you to Auschwitz.

ever ything else. W e were waiting. W ehad nof ood,nonothing. T he Germ ans got the train.  
T hey wanted totake us to Germ any.  They didn't tell us where we were going.  But Ihad to tell 
a story about a man'swif e.  
 
 
T here was one guy cam e in to Pionki whenIwas still working in 
thefactory.  He was in the ghetto, m y hom etown.  He was shippedtoT reblinka with the whole

all 8,000 people."  W e called him  crazy. W edidn'tbelieve him.  Hetold us
 
--
 
" sohow did you 
com e back?"  He saidthe Germanspickedhim  up because he was a tall,handsome, big m an.  
He was loading the trains totake the people to Germ any.  Hehid inthe wagon.  He cam eout, 
jum ped the train f rom  som e
where
.  He came to our camp. Becausehis sister was w
or

there,too.  His namewas Ma x.  He told us the Germ ans killed everybody.  I asked him , "Max, 

did they kill m y f ather, my mother,m y sisters?"   
ﬁ
Everybody.  T hey'r e dead. T hey gassedthem 
in one night.
ﬂ
  
So we called him  crazy. 
 
 
W hen the Germans were taking uson thetrain in Pionki, 
shipping us to Auschwitz, he says, " Iam not going on no train."  He run through thebarbed 

wi re and tried to escape.  They shot him  rightthereand was hanging on the wire.  Dead. This 
was Ma x.  T he reasonI mention hisnam e,I don't want to everf orget about it. 
 
 
Finally we cam e to Auschwitz.  But what happened tom e in the

I still have to tell what happened to me inPionki.  The work I was doing 
was ver y dangerous.  T he gases eat m e up.  My gl

T he Germ ans and Pols were gi ven m asks. W edidn'thave no masks. W e just put rags in our

I hada Poli

Finally he did give m e a job in a locom otive. T ransfer the cotton and put it into rollersf orother

And it cleaned up. 
 
 
T hen theGermans kept me f ora while.  All the b

Germ ans, came and took me to work in a coal m ine. T his was the worst place on earth.  You 

go down eight

100,200 people, 180,150 com eoutalive and you're lucky.  
Ever y day som ebody else died there.  Nof ood. T hey don't give you m uch to eat. They gi ve

And then there was aGerm an supervisor.  A 
Na zi,  a

He used to walk around with a walking stick
 
with a copperhandle.  He
 
was supposed to check.  
But he was

he hit peoplefor nothing.  If you didn't rushfast,hehityou over the head and 
killed you.  He killed a lot of peoplef or nothing.
 
 
T here was a Polish m iner, anice guy.  He was theone putting

W

he was 16 years old when they brought himf rom  Auschwi tz.  He was a replacement

W henever they lookedat him , he whispered in sound.  Prayed all the time, in Hebrew, f

1945, one day in January
 
1945, you were told to come up outof

t he

I came outof  the coalm ine.  And then they li ne us up.  
Ever ybody had to hook uparm to arm  and walk. W e didn't walk them ainhighway. W ehad to 
walk thef ields, country roads, in the snow, January
 
1945.  It was cold and snow, winter.  
People were dying.  T his is what they called them arch, we had tomarch. W enam ed it the 

Death March.  Because if youf alldown, a bullet in your head.  Hundreds, hundreds of 
thousands of people were killed.  My camp was maybe 2,000, 3,000, 4,000.  Idon't kno
w h o w

food."  Sureenough, I crawled over in the ravine
,  
andthere was a deadhorse.  Dogs were 
grabbing pieces ofm eat.  I grabbed apiece of meat, too.  And Rubin, he was a religiousboy, 

and he cannot eat no

only kosher.  You know?  So he said," Godwi ll f orgive m e, t

He toldm e toeat everything.  I said," I know that."  
 
A n d I  at e a

W hat happened to him is another story. W edon'thave enoughtime.

So oneday I see a guy, a German

the German tookhim

put itonf ire.  A lotof people didn't make it out. W e were stuffed in like wood, like straw. The 
barn caughtf ire.  A lot of people got burned. Didn't make it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  David, eventually on this march you would end up at a place called 

Blechhamm er. W hat happened once you got there?

Af ter the war I was f ree.  Sof ree man.  Nohom e, no nothing,no wife, no children,no 
possessions, no nothing.  So I was like abird.  I was everywhere.  I traveled all over Europe.  I 
went to Russia.  I went to France. I went everywhere.  I had nothing to lose.
 
 
In Germ any I lived in a D

the German girls.  I was in my 20's.  Youngman. I was f ree. You know?  So I gotthe whole of  

m y hand.  Am ericans had candy, cigarettes. I didn'thave anything to compete. So I said the 
soldiers who liberated Europe cam e

Am erican soldiers, were

the new ones who cam ein, 
they were com petition.  Me, them , we competed. SoI said, eh, I goto Am erica later. I don't 

need to go toAmerica.  I could have gone to the United States right away.
