Your

he re.
He

back
to
America.
Interviewer:
He

For

maki ng.

Interviewer:
Would

have
been

the
1930s?
Katalin

Earlier,
mu
ch
earlier.
Interviewer:
Before

all
the

Katalin
:
They
had
the
childre n
at
home.
They
came
to
America
to
work
very
hard
to
send
money
to
the m.

Interviewer:
So,
some
of
the
childre n,
the
older
children,
immigrated
to
America
very
early.
In
1910?

Katalin
:
In
1910
mayb
e,

Interviewer:
Before

New
York
area,
yes.
Interviewer:

mon ey
ba ck
to
help
the
f a mily?
Katalin
:
And
the
father
came
over
several
tim es

Interviewer:
Three
tim es?

Katalin
:
Three
tim es
to
visit.
Shove ling
the
coal,
he
di dn™t
pay
the
fare,
he
was
working.

Interviewer:
That™s
very
interestin g.
Do
you
kn
ow
if
he
ever
thou ght
of
bringing
over
the
res t
of
the
family?

Katalin
:
No,
because
a
lot
of
family
was

bri ng
the m
over,
he
co uldn™t
afford
to?

the
fare,
I
wonder,
of
th

other
childr

Katalin
:
I
don™t

I
don™t
know.
Mayb e
they
had
already
the
mon ey
fro m
their

what
he
sent
to
th em.

Interviewer:
So
we™re
talking
about
Ja c o b
Katz,
your
second
husba nd™s
father,
who
visited
several
times
in
the
1920s?

Katalin
:
Maybe
1910.

Interviewer:
But
in
th
e
19
30s,
he
proba bly
di d
not.
Katalin
:
I
don™t
thi nk
so.
Maybe
he
sent
them
money
to
her
d a ughters
to
come
over.
You
see
that
when
he
came
to
A m erica
he
saved
money
and
then
sent
back
to
Hungary
for
her
daughters.
Interviewer:
All
right.
Did
your
husband
ever
tal
k
abo
ut
his
mother ™s
side
of
th e
family
at
all?
Do
you
know
anything

Katalin
:
I
don™t
know.
I
don™ t
know;

28.
Interviewer:
What
di d
he

di
ploma
in?

Katalin
:
From
th
e
Uni v ersity.
Li ke
diplomat
bu t
he
cou ldn™t
get
a
job
be cause
he
was
a
Jew.
It
started
anti
r
Semitic
in
this
time.

Interviewer:
All
right.
Th is
is
importa nt.
So
he
gradu a ted
with
his
diplomati c
degree
when
he
was
27
or
28,
so
it
was
around
19 38

And
he
was
s till
not
able
to
get
a
job
as
early
as
193
0.

Katalin

No,
because
he
was
Jew.
The

it.
And
then
he
went
to
studying
th e
mi ne,
en gineeri ng,
and
th en
he
continued
with
th e
mines.

Interviewer:
So
that™s
very
important.
He
received
his
diplomati c
degree,
but
he
was
unab
le
to
use
it
because
of
anti
r
Jewish
la ws?
Katalin

Righ t.
Interviewer:
Now,
when
you

was
no
synagogue
in
a
small

but
we
had
the
holidays
in
a
very
old
Jewish
couple™s

Except
for
my

and
he
ha d
exa ms,
and
he
