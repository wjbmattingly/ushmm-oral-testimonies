spoke at home, your father™s occupation?
 What can you tell me  about your life 
before the war?  

A: We spoke mainly Yiddish in the house.
 My father had the butcher store, kosher 
butcher store in the town. And as far as re
ligion, we were quite religious. We went 
to shul almo st every mo rning. 

Q: Was it a  Chassidish family?  

A: Yes, well this Œ that time I would not 
know what Œ you know
. But I know we Œ 
somebody used to always call 
[sp eaks foreign language here] 
you know, with the 
five boys. So this is the way the saying 
used to be. So this 
is how I know, and I 
remember that. 
Q: And what type of schooling did you go 
to? Were you at a cheder, yeshiva, or a 
secular school?  

A: We went Œ we went Œ I was too young to
 go to yesh iva. My older brother went 
and we 
[indecipherable]
 town from Œ from Œ from us about six kilometers, w h ich 
we had a 
[indeciphera ble]
 yeshiv a there. My older br
other, I remember, went to 
that yeshiva because he was older Œ older. 
David
. 
Q: And were you in cheder, or Œ 
A: After we finished school around tw o 
Œ two o™clock or thr
ee o™clock, I don™t 
remember, we went straight to the cheder.

Q: And tell me something about the co
mposition of the town. Was it a mostly 
Jewish town? Were there much in the way 
of relationships between the Jews and the 
non-Jews in the town? 
A: Well, it was not Œ it was not Œ I don™t Œ 
I Œ this I cou-couldn™t tell really, because 
I remember when it used to be Christma
stime. We had to close the windows and 

close the doors, and lock the windows for 
the protection, otherwise all Œ all the 
windows would have been broken  from the 
house. Cause this is the way it di Œ 
because th-they demonstrated during the da
y Christmastime. Not the Jews, but the 
non-Jews. And that™s what brought up the ha
tred, a little bit. But th
en during the rest 
of the year, my  father had the butcher st
ore, here was kosher and here was non-
kosher, different part. So they used
 to come and buy meats from us. 
Q: And at school, did th e Jewish childre
n an d the non-Jewish children socialize 
together at all? 

A: This is a hard question to answer, b
ecause when  children get together, you know, 
they love each other, or they not Œ they  hate each other, not e Œ but there was 

nothing really involved that 
we hate each other or something, just fun. But later on, 
you know, when  I was already 12 years, 
13, I remember certain things, yeah, in 
school. But by that time the Hungaria
ns already occupied  us, in 1940.

Q: And in terms of secular languages, di
d the Jewish community speak Hungarian or 
Romanian? 
A: My father spoke Hu ngarian, because he  was in the first World War, and that was 
during th e Hungarian time. And mo st of 
them spoke Ro manian and Œ but that Œ 
somebody else spoke Hungarian, I rea
lly don™t know. You know, it™s tough. 
Q: And extended fami ly, did 
you have an ex tended fami ly
 living in the same to wn? 
A: I Œ y-yes, in the same town, next door
 was Œ lived my father™s sister. And the 
town  next, two kilometers away, lived hi
s brother. So it was always together, you 
could walk Œ Saturd ay you 
could walk the three kilometers and meet, you know. 
Q: And holidays you spent together? 

A: Holidays, sometimes but not really, b
ecause everybody had a big family, and you 
didn™t have homes that big, you know. 
Q: So 
[indecipherable]
 Oh, let me record again. So 
what about your grandparen ts, 
were they in the 
area, in the town? 
A: My mother™s father lived about half a 
kilometer away from us, 
on this side of the 
town , and we lived almo st on this side of
 the town. But the ch
eder was across the 
street from him, the cheder where I went. 
Q: Yeah.

A: And he was a very religious person, you
 know. So  the kids who came into the 
syn Œ to the synagogue Saturday  mo
rning, they were afraid for for 
Selig
(ph). His 
name was 
Selig
(ph) 
Lassa
(ph). Because he just took
 a look, and everybody was 
trembling. 
Q: What was his occupation? 

A: This I wouldn™t know, you 
know, what his occupation, be
cause I think he lived to 
be 80 or 85 or something,
 you know, because he was qu
ite old when  we Œ we knew 
him, because my mother was 
the youngest get Œ to get ma
rried, and she was born in 
1994. 

Q: So let™s fast track a little bit, and I want
 to ask you about 1939
, with the start of 
World War II, did news reach 
Romania
 ab out the invasion of 
Poland
? Did you 
have any knowledge of what was going on in 
Germany
 and 
Poland
? 
A: Mm-mm. 

Q: No. 
A: No, beca Œ not complete
ly, you know. The only knowl
edge we could know, if 
somebody came from that ar
ea, from somewhere in 
[indecipherable]
, because there 
was no telephones in the town
. There was no electricity in
 town, and once in a while 
you just got the newspaper from somewher
e else, you know. So 
it™s Œ and nobody

really knew until later, whatever happened in 
Poland
, or whatever happened 
somewhere else. 
Q: But you reme mb er people comi
ng from other town s, making it into 
Romania
? 
A: Yes, I Œ I remember that, but as a youn
g boy, you™re not that 
much interest what 

he has to say, you know, because
 you wouldn™t understand it mu ch. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: You know, really. I™m telling the truth. 
Q: So 1940 your life changed. Wh at
 Œ tell me about the year 1940. 
A: In 1940, when 
Hitler
 told 
Horthy
, whatever his name was, from 
Hungary
, you 
can re-occupy this area, 
Maramures
, you can re-occupy th at 
you had it the first Œ 
before the first World War. So the soldiers
 came and traveled 
days and nights. You 
know, they Œ they could not have that ma
ny soldiers that they should go around and 
we should see them for two weeks. But we
 saw the same  guys coming th e same day. 
Q: And how did that change your daily life? 
A: It Œ not at the moment, the first year
 it didn™t really change, you know? The only 
thing is, we had to learn a diffe
rent language and we went to 
[indecipherable]
 
school, and we didn™t unde
rstand anything wh at we 
Œ because it was Hungarian 

already, 
Hungary
. So you didn™t understand a
nything, because we went to 
Romanian school as 
children, you know.

Q: Was it the same teachers, or did they
 bring in all new 
teachers who were 
Hungarian born? 
A: I™m sure they ki Œ bro
ught in the teachers, because 
the teachers that we knew Œ 
and I really didn™t know whether theyspeak hungar Œ I know
 my father spoke 
Hungarian for one reason, b
ecause the soldiers must 
have had on their agenda 
certain things that 
Yorel
(ph) 
Pollak
 was Œ was a 
g-gender
(ph) 
urmeshda
(ph) th ey 
call it that time, like a Œ not a general Œ not
 a Œ in the army, like a Œ how do you call 
it? A little officer, you know, in
 the army, in the first W o
rld War. So the soldiers 
who passed through my  town, some of them
 stopped in our house,
 and they  wanted 
to have some wine to drink and this 
[indecipherable]
. So I knew, but we were not 
allowed to go into the room 
when they talked to my fa ther, as childr en. Nobody was 
allowed to know. 

Q: And your father ne
ver told the children Œ 
A: He wouldn™t Œ he wouldn™t 
Œ he wouldn™t hurt us, you me
an, he wouldn™t say that 
that™s what they said, and th
ings like th Œ but later on, we
 felt something is not right. 
But at 1942 already, I had somebody co
me, a friend came from Œ who went to 
Budapest
 a half a year before. 
[indecipherable]
 And he says, 
Ernie
, you™re already 
13 - 14 years old, 15 years old, 15 and a 
half years old. Come to me with Œ to 
Budapest
 and you™ll learn a trade. What are y
ou gonna do in this
 small town? I was

very good with my  hands and making, 
you know, certain th
ings, you know, in 
jewelry or anything. So  he says, co
me, you™re gonna become a jeweler. 
Q: And did you take
 him up on that? 
A: And I went right after 
Pesach
, when he went back. I went back to 
Buda pest 
and 
I couldn™t get anything on th e jewelry, I couldn
™t get Œ so he says, let™s go to a dental 
laboratory, maybe you™re gonna be Œ they
™re going to  teach you to  be a dental 
technician, cause he was there in that place
 also. But he quit af
ter a while, you know, 
so I went in there and I stood th ere til the 
Germans came in, for a year and a half, 
almost two years. 
Q: So w-were Œ from 1942 
to 1944, you™re living in 
Budapest
? 
A: Lived in 
Budapest
. 
Q: And did you have any contact with your 
family, did you know what was going on 
in 
Mamorsha
(ph)? 
A: Yes, because we used to write, we used
 to write almo st every week, you know, in 
Yiddish we used to write the postcard. But 
my  older brother was with me that time, 
because he also wa
nted to come to 
Buda pest
, away from the small town, let™s put it 
this way. 
Q: And was the motivation for coming to 
Budapest
 because they thought it was 
easier to earn a livi
ng, or because Œ 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
11
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ they were politically safer? 

A: No, easier to earn a living, because po
litically I did not Œ I don™t know whether 
anybody as young boys and gi
rls thought about politically at
 that time, but they saw 
that you could sense certain thing. You sens
ed it, but you didn™t make anything of it, 
as long as you were okay. Bu
t to make a living had gotten 
harder in  the town, so I 

figured I got to learn a trade. 
Q: And from the postcards that your family 
sent to you, did yo
u have a sense that 
their life ch anged over those two years? 
A: Yes, the last year especially. 
Q: And how did it change? 
A: Changed Œ they  were not allowed Œ let™
s say, soon as the 
ger Œ soon as the 
Hungarians came in, and my father was a but
cher in the Œ in the Jew Œ in a Œ in a 
strictly Orthodox sense, you know? And a 
Œ and you have to slaughter a cow or a 
calf or a sheep in a certain wa
y to be kosher. You have to slaughter. You have to get 

a 
shochet
, right? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So we used to have our own pl
ace, you know, we were three butchers 
[indecipherable]
. And we had the same  place, we just Œ to take the cows, or the 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
12
calf, or the Œ the Œ to  slaughter. But as s
oon as the Hungarians came in, they fo rbid
 
you. You™re not allowed to get a
 shochet
 to slaughter. How do 
you have to slaughter 
the cow? You got to hit it right here. 
Q: And so wa Œ 
A: Which is Œ that™s ridiculous because 
when you™re slaughtering, the reason why 
you slaughter the cow, because you™re Œ you
™re taking all the veins, which are here, 
and the blood co mes out from the animal. 
So this is what you call it the kosher. 
Noth ing could happen to the Œ to th e Œ 
to the meat, or to 
whatever. So that 
[indecipherable]
 so, right away, even 
while I was still home. 
Q: So did your father th en
 begin to continue on as a 
butcher but fo r non-kosher 
meat, or did he stop wo rking? 

A: No, he st Œ no, no, we still had the meat
, k o sher meat, cause instead of going in 
during th e day to slaughter, you went in two o™clock at night. 

Q: And to provide fo r Œ 
A: And we were hiding it. 
Q: And did he contin ue to sell it to the other Œ 

A: Yeah, we took my  older brother Œ took my  older brother 
Moishe
(ph), and me and 
my father, and we went 
down and we took the 
shochet
 and they slaughtered it. 
Q: And did other Jews in town  continue to buy it Œ 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
13
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ surreptitiously as well? 

A: Yes, yes, they knew it, because the 
shochet 
lived in town, yo
u know, so they 
knew it. But it gotten always a little b
it worse, because when I Œ when 
Hitler
 came 
into 
Buda pest
 in May, I think it was in Œ not in May Œ 
Q: March. 

A: March. March 17. Came into 
Budapest
. I already had letters from my  hometown, 
from my  father, that in Apr
il, and before Ap ril, they
 already gathered them, you 
know, in the synagogue, and they al
ready started the transports to 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: So I wanted to come and 
talk about your experience in 
Buda pest
, but let™s just 
still talk with your parents. So when di
d you find out that yo
ur parents had been 
deported, and how much of your family Œ th
e Germans came in in March, and then 
you said already the next m
onth they were gath ered up? 
A: Th-Th-They came in
 Œ they came into 
Budapest 
in March, but to my hometown 
they came in earlier. This why I said, b
ecause I got a notice from my parents in 
April yet, that we were gathered already 
to be shipped out somewhere, but I didn™t 
know any place where, 
I didn™t know nothing. 
Q: And Œ 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
14
A: Where Œ where my  brother Œ only my  brother who was with me in 
Buda pest
, 
that™s it. I didn™t know nothing what ha
ppened with th em the first two months. 
Q: So who was still in 
Romania
? Was your parents and the other six siblings? 
A: Yes, because they were Œ the four of 
them that were younger, and my sister, and 
they were Œ yeah, my sister 
[indecipherable]
 so my sister was older, but were still 
home, you know. Only my  second, 
the one who was after my sister, 
David
 and I 
[indecipherable]
 the fourth, were in 
Budapest
, the rest, six, were already a-all 
home, didn™t go no place. As a matter of fact
, I found out after the war that my older 
brother 
Moishe
(ph) was going to run over to 
Poland 
and hide
 
some Œ somewhere 
there. But this is what somebody 
told me who I met after the war.  
Q: So, now let™s move to 
Budapest
, and we™ll move back in time. So, in ™42, you 
come with your brother, and you become a dental technician. 
A: Yeah, I worked in a laboratory. 

Q: Now, tell me about the life in 
Budapest 
for you, away from 
your family, for 
those two years before the Germans came in. 

A: It was not bad, let™s put it this way. Re
ally not Œ before the 
Œ before the Germans 
came in, it was not bad.  
Q: And where were you living? 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
15
A: I was living in 
Da butsa
(ph), it was not far from the 
real Œ the synagogue, you 
know, I was living by my s Œ by a Œ by a Œ 
an older couple who rented me a room. 
Not my  own apartment, or my  own 
[indecipherable]
 gave me a room Œ 
Q: And you™re still religious at this point? 
A: Yes. And as a matter of fact, the 
Da ha ni
(ph) synagogue was not far away, and I 
used to go every Frid ay night to listen to
 the cantor. Yo u know, it™s used Œ th ings 
from home, so I Œ so I was going every Frid ay 
night to listen to the cantor because I 
wanted to , and my  older brother did the same  thing. 

Q: And was your older brother living in th
e same house, or he was living elsewhere? 
A: No, no, because they di
dn™t have big room
s enough to have two people living 
there, so he lived in anot
her apartment with 
somebody else, another older couple. 

Q: But you saw each ot
her frequently beside? 
A: Yes, we saw each other frequently, yes.  

Q: And so now, March 1944, 
Germany
 occupies 
Hungary
. 
A: Yes. 

Q: How did your Œ tell me your memo ries
 of the day when 
you fo und out that 
Hungary 
was no lo nger independent. 
A: Well, we looked out of the windows 
and we saw the marching. And each one 
came to sou Œ there™s gonna be trouble, it™
s gonna be trouble. Because a few days 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010

later, they already send out notices to the Je
wish people like no Œ now, if I had to put 
down  a stick here, and start a 
[indecipherable]
 and if somebody killed me during 
the day, he knew nothing is going to happ
en  to him, because the Germans is not 
going to prosecute him, orthe Hungarians, because he 
killed a Jew. So you were 
afraid to go out on the street. 
Q: And you noticed a difference in terms of
 how th e Hungarians treated you, apart 

from the Germans. The Hungar Œ 
A: The Hungarians were almost the same 
way, you know. Almo st Œ almo st like the 
Germans. Now, but that time, I don™t kno
w how mu ch contro l the Germans had yet, 
but the Hungarian army  had a lot of control. I guess 
Hitler
 gave them the Œ gave 
them that they can 
do that. They called 
munka  [indecipherable] zwangsarbeit
, you 
know, forced labor fo
r the Jewish people. 
Q: And when were you called up for forced labor? 
A: For forced labor I co Œ wa
s called Œ even  though you™re 
supposed to be only 18 y 
Œ you™re supposed to  be 18 years old, bu
t I was called up. And you had to wear a 
card with the s Œ with the re
 Œ with the Œ with the yello
w band here, and gather here 
and then they took 
you to forced labor. Because by 
that time, the Americans Œ the 
Americans did a lot of damage to 
Budapest
. They bombed a lot of things, important 
things in 
Buda pest
. And th ey marched us to clea
n up wh atever they  had there. 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak

Q: And was your brother also conscripted? 
A: No, my  brother ran Œ somewhere was hidi
ng. He found a Œ he 
found a family that 
he could hide, you know. And 
he had a girlfriend, you kno
w. And to me, I think he 
disappeared during this time al
ready. I didn™t see him an d I didn™t know where he is, 
because see, either he didn™t want to come 
out, he should be re
cognized. So I had to 
do th ings on my  own, even 
though I wasn™t 18 years old 
yet. But they took me to 
these kind of wo rks. And then , month later, th
is was Œ let™s see, this was May, June, 
July, around July already Œ 
I mean, rumors went down that
 they™re going to  ship us 
away to ric Œ to a camp, right. So, be
cause we lived already in a ghetto. 
Q: And Œ 
A: It™s called a close out there, close ou Œ I 
mean, the streets, just like let™s say you Œ 
you Œ your 
Connecticut
 circle or something like this. So
 this is the streets that they 
have. And that was a ghetto there. 
Q: And so you were in the 
ghetto and then  each day they marched you fo rced la Œ 
A: In the ghetto, each day, 
they knew because 
they came into the hall in the bottom, 
you know, in those Œ because 
the ghetto is, you know you™re 
there, they have the big 
apartments here, and here is
 like a garage you can come in the middle, you know. 
And all you had to see, all the Jew ish 
people should come 
down, you know, and 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
18
they knew who we are. So they forced us
 to the labor camp , because mo st of them 
were Jewish, you know. 
Q: And so when  you were in
 for forced labor, were you
 living in the ghetto? Were 
you already moved to a labor camp? 

A: In the Œ in the Œ in th
e Œ in the ghetto. In the ghe
tto. Because I remember the 
Holocaust Museum™s name, what
 is the street where you Œ 
Q: 
Raoul Wallenberg
. 
A: 
Raoul Wallen 
Œ I saw him.  
Q: So wha Œ 

A: He was still there w h en we Œ he gathered
 us Œ you know, a lot of Jews who were 
below 18, you had to  be still, you know, gath
ered us, because I would have been 18 
in 2,000 Œ in na Œ in Œ in 
September, but that was, I think, a little before September, 
because I think they we
re Œ he came from Œ from 
Sweden
 bu Œ 
Sweden
 bu Œ but we 
didn™t know anything about it. So he told
 Œ spoke to hundreds
 or maybe thousands 
of Jewish boys and girls, 
you know. What was the talk? 
Hitler
 wants the Americans 
should Œ I should 
[indecipherable]
 to the Americans. They
 want 10,000 trucks and 
he™s gonna let 10,000 
boys and girls go to 
America
. Jewish. But the Americans 
refused the trucks, so the Germ
ans came right away to cross 
[indecipherable]
 
Austria

Q: So let me ask Œ move back a little b
it and ask you two questions. One is if you 
can describe a little bit more about the t
ype of work you were
 doing in the labor 
battalion, and th e other is, when you talk ab out having seen 
Raoul Wallenberg
, do 
you know any people who made
 it to the glass house, and were saved thro ugh him? 
If you can address those two areas? 
A: No, no, I don™t know. Really I wouldn ™t know. But you know
, you didn™t Œ you 
didn™t go there every day, because you were
n™t in the ghetto, yo
u know, in the place 
that™s a Œ maybe it was in the shul, in 
the synagogue that he gathered us, or 
somewhere else. But you know 
wh en you™re this age a
nd you Œ one day you come 
and one day you don™t come. It™s
 Œ it™s not something that Œ th
at Œ that Œ that Œ that Œ 
that you believe something is going to ha
ppen, you know. You hope, but Œ and then 
they just disapp
eared, everything. 
Q: And did you have enough to  eat in the ghetto? 

A: In the ghetto nobody had en
ough to eat. That Œ th ey gave us, let™s say, a bread, 
for three days, a pound of bread, or four da
ys. Now, you tried not to eat it, correct, in 
Mauthausen
, you tried to eat every day a piece. But you had to sleep with it, you 
had to hide it, you 
had Œ otherwise somebody stole it from you. 
Q: So after a month, say you left Œ 
you were taken from the ghetto and Œ

A: We were Œ we were Œ we were walked, we
 were not thre Œ we Œ we Œ they didn™t 
Œ see, let™s say this is 
Budapest
,
 Hungary
, and this is the 
border to go to 
Austria
. 
And 
Ma uthausen
 could be here, maybe 500 kilome
ters, or I don™t know how much. 
So we walked from here
, over here and here. 
Q: So Œ 
A: Th-They made us sleep in certain places, I™d say Œ 

Q: How long was the march? 
A: It took maybe a month, or
 maybe six weeks, or maybe two months, I don™t know 
exactly. 

Q: And do you know ab out how mu ch Œ l
ong you were marching each day? Was it 
10 kilometers, 20 kilometers? 

A: This Œ well, you marched, because Œ 
this I wouldn™t know. No , you just obeyed 
orders, you know. 

Q: Right. And but all day long, you 
got up in the mo
rning, walked Œ 
A: Right, right, but Œ but th
e Œ the funny thing is this, because I been saying those 
things too. Once we crossed the border, 
is we didn™t Œ we didn™t sleep outside 
because it Œ the winter started to come, yo
u know, in Œ in Œ in
 September, October, 
there™s cold already. So Œ so, in certain places where they knew 
the Œ let™s say they 
took us into a place like this, which in Œ 
can take in, if you want to sleep 30 - 40 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak

people, so they put in a hundred people.
 So  you couldn™t sleep, you couldn™t lay 
down . You could only stay. Now,
 if somebody died Œ I se Œ 
I been saying this all the 
time, if somebody died, you di
dn™t report it to them, you ju
st took them as Œ as a 
pillow, and you slept on them, you know. So that was a difficult situation, walking 

and stopping, and walk
ing until we reached 
Mauthausen
. 
Q: Who was guarding you wh ile
 you were walking? Were these Hungarians, or Œ 
A: No, once we crossed Œ we went, 
we crossed the Œ from ha Œ from 
Hungary
, that 
was the Austrian army . 

Q: And in 
Hungary
 it was Hungarians? 
A: 
Hungary
 was Hungarians, yeah. 
Q: And when you were walk
ing, what were you wearin
g? Were these the clothes 
you had with  you from the ghetto? 

A: Well, I had Œ no, see, it was too late fo
r that time when we cam
e to the ghetto, or 
the changes, the clothes like you see in th
e movies that you had those stripes and 
[indecipherable] 
no. 
Q: So it was civilian clothes. 

A: We did have Œ we still ha
ve the Œ had the Œ only the clothes that we came with, 
you know. Noth ing else but a 
pair of pants and a jacket an-and a shirt or whatever, 
and that™s it. Cause you couldn™t Œ we we
re not allowed to ta
ke anything with you 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
22
while you were walking, cause you didn™t
 have nowh ere to put it, no place, you 
know. 
Q: And then  wh en did they Œ did th ey 
feed you once a day, or week , or Œ 
A: In the ghetto they fed us once a day, lu
nchtime. So in other word s, they gave you 
a bread for three, four days. 
You had to be your own mast
er on it, to eat it one time, 
or you can not eat nothing fo r the next three 
days, or just cut it, or Œ or tear off a 
piece and eat today and tear off a piece and eat tomorrow. 
Q: And wh ile you were marching? 
A: While we were marching, you know, it™
s Œ it™s Œ it™s gonna be stopped, because 
they have nothing to  feed us wh en we
 were walk. They brought us a soup 
sometimes, you know, later on, because let™s 
say we stopped five 
o™clock, two hours 
later they brought in the 
[indecipherable]
 you know, for every
body something. But 
food, forget it, it™s not really Œ 
Q: And did they Œ 
A: This why people died, mainly cause
 you didn™t have any fo od at all. 
Q: So of your group Œ yo
u started with about a hundred ? About how many people 
died en route, was 
the mortality rate Œ 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak

23
A: I wish I knew, but because y-you know, 
y-you™re talking Œ first of all, you™re 
talking to  a very young pers
on, you know, who did not e
xperience anything of the 
sort. And it didn™t think that it sh
ould go into my 
mind to watch Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: I only think I watched because they to
ld  you when  you walked , let™s say here, 
five people walked in the street, and th
ey announced it in Ge
rman, if somebody™s 
going to  step out, is gonna be shot. So ever
ybody was Œ was very, very alert, just to 
walk exactly behind anybody, not to
 step out this way from the line. 
Q: Now, when you were walk
ing, did civilians, Hungarians or Austrians ever stop 
and sort of look at you? 
Did you ever see people Œ 
A: They stopped, but they didn™t say a wo
rd , you know. They  laug
hed, they didn™t s 
Œ didn™t say a word, I mean, it™s nothing. 

Q: Did they come out thinking that it was so
mething interesting to see, or was it just 
Œ 
A: Oh, they enjoyed it. This is 
the way it looked to us, you know. 
Q: So were you walk ing thro ugh 
towns, or in th
e countryside? 
A: Most of it the countryside, you know
. Sometimes you had to walk through a 
town , because in order to find somewhere to
 put us up, so the towns had Œ either 
they had the churches, or they had other things. 
[indecipherable]
 you could Œ you 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
24
could Œ stalls, you know, from Œ for the cows
. They  took the cows out and th ey put 
us in there for the night,
 you know, things like this. 
Q: And at any point did they th ey
 tell you where you were marching to? 
A: No. 
Q: So eventually af Œ you arrive in 
Mauthausen
, or Œ 
A: Eventually we arrived in 
Ma uthausen
, but 
Mauthausen
 was so full that they 
didn™t have empty space for us where to pu
t it Œ put us. So they  built, you know, for 
the outside, those Œ th-those Œ how Œ th-the
y build now f Œ you 
know, when  Œ when  
the Œ 

Q: At barracks?  
A: Tents. 
Q: Tents. 

A: Tents. Tents, you know, they built for 
Œ they built tents. I 
mean they built not 
small tents, they built tents that 
could take in a thousand people. 
Q: And tell me what your reaction was wh en you saw 
Mauthausen
 for the first 
time. You™ve been marching for a month a
nd then you get to this place. What was 
the first thing th at crossed your mind? 
A: Scary, very scary. You don™t know 
wh at™s hap Œ gonna 
happen. You did not 
know nothing. The only thing 
you heard, a lot of bomb ing at night, because I think 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
25
the Americans already bombed thes
e places. Because they bombed 
Budapest
 and 
the Americans 
[indecipherable]
 was still there. And they 
bombed, you kno
w, so th-
that™s the only thing we could hear. 
Q: And did you get to talk
 to any of the prisoners who had been th ere before? 
A: No. 
Q: So you had no id ea 
what it was, or Œ 
A: No, because there was Jews and non-
Jews prisoners and a lot of Russian 
prisoners in there also, o-on those Œ in 
the regular barracks, you know, it was very, 
very big. 

Q: And when you arrived, did they  issu
e you camp  uniforms, or you stayed Œ 
A: No. This why I™m saying this, I 
found th is picture in my  pocket. 
Q: And did you have any wo
rk  assignments once you got there, or you just Œ 
A: Most of the time no, b
ecause you know, every Œ ever
y barrack had Œ had a Œ a 
ka po
, a leader, a Jewish leader, that™s it. Th e Germans said, you™re
 going to be the 
ka po
, you™re going to be responsible for th
ose thousand people. Th
ey  cannot go out 
unless you take them out. We tell you to ta
ke mi Œ take out 10
 or 20 or 30, and go 
there and there. 
Q: What was your impression of the 
ka po
? 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
26
A: I really don™t know, because m-maybe
 I Œ maybe when you™re younger than Œ 
they were older people there also with 
us. They probably would have known certain 
things or they would have, you know. Bu t 
my a Œ my  impression was to just keep 
quiet and don™t mix in, and do
n™t do ju st you are t Œ what you are told. That was my  
impression and this what I did. 

Q: And so one day was pretty mu ch the sa
me as the other for your last time Œ 
A: Right, the same. Y ou see, as Œ as Œas they came closer, the Germans Œ I mean, 
the Americans, you know, occupy this part of 
Austria
 and this part, they came 
[indecipherable]
 closer Œ I™m talking months later, 
they used to take
 us out to work  
on 
schü tzengraben
. 
Q: Describe that. 
A: 
Schützengraben
. This is for the Œ fo
r the army it was you go
 into  those foxholes. 
Q: So you were digging th em, or Œ 

A: Yep, we are digging, digging and digg
ing, di-digging, and 
digging and digging 
and then  brought back, you know, brought
 back you know, but Œ and then th e 
Americans still came closer, right. So th
is was already January, February. In 
February, I think, in the beginning of
 February they marched us out from 
Mauthausen
 Œ or Œ or in January, I™m not sure Œ marched us out from 
Mauthausen
, 
and they took us to a place, 
Gunskirchen
. 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak

27
Q: And was life there any different than 
Mauthausen
? 
A: Worse. Because that was in ou Œ in 
th e mountains, you know
, and it was raining 
and muddy. You Œ you Œ you co
uldn™t even go and lay down
 to  sleep, you can only 
stay, because the mud was still here. 
Q: To your Œ 

A: In the barracks, with no floors. T
il Œ til May the fourth, of the liberation. 
Q: Describe liberation day. 
A: I talked so much about that liberation 
day. We get up in the morning from like I 
said, the 
ka po
. Me Œ not me, because the older people who were in the camp. So the 
ka po
 going in and out, several 
ka po s
, knock on doors Œ on th er
e. They didn™t know 
what happened. So  I don™t know
, at 10 o™clock 
or 11 o™clock 
[indecipherable]
 
people looked out, they didn™t see any Ge
rmans in the uniforms, they didn™t see any 
be Œ if they saw a German he was running 
this way, you know. So
 they came in and 
told everybody, something is wrong, some
thing is going on, yo
u know. Bu t by two 
o™clock, you know, the 
ka po
 came in, says the German left because the Americans 
are coming. But we have to wait til the Am
ericans are going to come here, because 
yo-you don™t know where the Germans ar
e now. They  are not here. If you go out 

now, you might find a German 
who can do harm to you. So  we were in there, but 
some people, older people, younger people 
Œ I was too weak and to o young to  s Œ to 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak

Œ to think, went out from the Œ from the Œ 
from the barracks, and th ey went to the Œ 
where they  had the fo od that Œ you know Œ a
nd started to open up the stores there, 
whatever they have sas Œ and they starte
d to bring it into th
e camp, you know. The 
reason wh y I reme mb er these things, I was t
oo weak to  go there, so I stood by the 
door Œ my wife, I used to tell her that 
story, and th is was a funny thing, what 
happened. I see one fellow, maybe a little ol
der, a year or two than I, which I never 

knew him, comes in with Œ with so methin
g in his hands like this, a jar like, you 
know. 
A2: Honey. 

A: Honey. I didn™t know it™s honey. So  I j Œ I was laying down th ere and I jump up 
and I grab it. And it made him full of hone
y on his face, and he was very angry at 
me. But I had some honey, and Œ and starte
d eating. An d then I didn™t see him again, 
we didn™t Œ no, we didn™t. But Œ I™ll tell th
is later on. So by f 
Œ I think it was around 
four o™clock, was no Œ who had watches, 
but we just looked at Œ was around four 

o™clock that the Americans came in. And th
ey opened th e door, so they says, you 
can go any place you want. So where do 
you go from d Œ you d
on™t know Œ nobody 
knew where. So they directed us 
to go into the town, it™s called 
Wels
. 
Wels
, it™s 30 
kil Œ 30 kilometers or less than 
Linz
 Œ from 
Linz
. So we all went into that town, I 
don™t know how many thousands of people, 
but a day later Œ we slept outside, 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
29
because there is no place where to sleep. 
A day later and two da
ys later and three 
days later, we were still walking around 
[indecipherable]
, but the Americans came 
with their 
Jeeps
 and grabbed us, put us in in th e 
Jeep
 and brought us to 
Wels
, 
because 
Wels
 had room for thousands of people because it was an 
SS
 camp, 
officers™ camp. And everything was empty, 
so they brought us there, you know. So 
we are there and they didn™t 
know how to feed us, so they
 gave us too mu ch fo od. A 
few days later, I je Œ I remember on a Su
nday mo rning, hundreds of people were 
laying outside hardly  breathing because th
eir stomachs swelled up, you know. And Œ 
an-and I found right there, some o f my
 Œ some Œ two people from my hometown  
laying th ere. 
Q: Had you known they  were in th e camp before? 
A: No, no I didn™t know. What happened to
 them, I don™t know, I think one of them 
died, but what happened to
 the other one, I really 
don™t know. But then the 
Americans got somebody in  and they Œ andthey advised them what to cook and 
what to serve for those people, otherwise 
[indecipherable]
 are gonna die. 
Q: Were there any Aust
rians still in the town? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And what was their attitude to what was going on? 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
30
A: Yeah. They were Œ just nothing, I mean, 
they j Œ th ey just looked, I suppose. I 
mean, nobody had any conversation with th
em. Not me, and not Œ not my  friends 
who were with me. Friends Œ those people 
who came with me. So we just looked 
and looked and looked, you 
know, so Œ but Œ until the Am
ericans came and took us 
into the 
Jeep
, said, let™s go Œ no, come. So, I re
memb er e l se, I™ m Œ  I™ m a week , t w o  
weeks, three weeks, I think after the four
th or the fifth week, I don™t remember 
exactly because nobody counted . I™m in the Œ in the Œ taking a shower, because it 
has community showers, like the people, you
 know, here for the women and here for 
the men. And I™m walking out dressed up to ta
ke a shave or whatever it is, and a girl 
comes over to me. And she looks at me. Sh
e says, I know your name. So I almo st 
dropped dead. You know, she 
said, wh at do you mean you 
[indecipherable]
 in 
Yiddish 
[indecipherable]
 she says, your name is 
Ernie Pollak
. So I figured right 
away somebody knew. Says, 
how do you know? She says, I 
was wit h  your siste r in 
the camp. Her name is 
Bluma
(ph) 
Park
. So I says, oh my God, tell me exactly 
where, you know, this was at Œ it was alre
ady four or five weeks, I don™t know 
exact. So she says to me, she is in 
Bergen-Belsen
. Now, 
Bergen-Belsen
, I don™t 
know how many hundreds of kilome 
Œ kilometers, because it was in 
Germany 
Œ it 
was from there. Now I would not
 Œ I did not expect that I™m
 gonna figure th Œ say to 
my self I™m going to  go to 
Bergen-Belsen
, how am I gonna go to 
Bergen-Belsen
? I 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak

31
don™t know. I don™t have good clothes even, I don™t have 
[indecipherable]
. So she 
says, when I came here, I came from 
Feldafing
, an Œ another 
DP
 camp. She says, 
you come with me to 
Feldafin g
, you know. She came to 
see her brother, she found 
out that her brother was Œ was in 
Wels
 with me. And she™s, you come with me , and 
then from there you gonna go to  
Bergen-Belsen
, which is not that far. So I went to 
Bergen-Belsen
, it took us three months. We got to 
Bergen-Belsen Erev rontef Œ 
Erev 
Ro sh Hashanah . Can you imagine how 
Œ how lo ng it took us to go there? I 
found some people from my hometown, y
ou know, and I started asking questions. 
You know 
Gans
(ph) 
[indeciphera ble]
 his brother, you know? And he says, your 
sister was never here. Whoever I asked, 
your sister was never here. Nobody knew 
what Œ what I™m asking, no
body knew her, nobody Œ so, I 
don™t know why she said 
to me that my 
sister  is in 
Bergen-Belsen
. But I was glad I was there amongst some 
other people that I know from my  hometown.
 And then, a year later Œ and I™m just 
jumping certain things because
 there™s a lot of things from here til the year later, I 
just want to bring two th ings togeth er 
about that fellow that
 I took the honey. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: He came with his sister from 
Romania 
back to 
Bergen-Belsen
, because he also 
said something, because we
 are sitting, you know, in 
Bergen-Belsen
 with friends, 
having lunch or something. 
Ber-Bergen-Belsen
 was also a camp  which it had a Œ 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak  
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
32
A2: A 
DP
 camp. 
A: A 
DP
 camp, yeah, because you know where 
Anne Frank
 was? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It™s jus Œ it™s Œ 
Anne Frank 
was in 
Belsen
. And 
Bergen
 was a Œ was an 
SS 
camp, which it had 10 - 15,000 
officers there, you know. 
And ben Œ berry Œ when vi 
Œ the liberation was, they took from 
Belsen
 th Œ where 
Anne F rank 
was, all boys 
and girls in here to the 
Bergen
 camp, because they had wher
e to live there, but in a 
concentration camp. So it became 
Bergen
-
Belsen
, together. So I sitting at a table, 
and this guy was sitting with his sister, 
you know, I mean that™s much later, about 
half a year later, or Œ or Œ or Œ or 10 mo
nths later. And we are talking, wh at do we 
talk, with him and with him and with hi
m, we telling the stories about camp, we 
telling the stories about camp, we telling wh
at happened  th is. And I happened to  tell 
that story. The guy sitting in front of me, 
he said, you son of 
a gun, it was you who 
did this to me. And 
[indecipherable]
 you know who. 
Q: So Œ 

A: So I apologized, what can I do? But we 
were friends, all the way. We came to the 
United States
 aga Œ together, and he wasn™t Œ he wasn™t in a Œ used  Œ I used to 
invite him to Œ to my Bar Mitzvahs to th
e kids, and th-that. So it worked out, you 
know, thank God, you know. 

 
Interview with Ernie Pollak

33
Q: Now, did you ever find your sister? 
A: Well, in order for me to find my sister 
and the rest of them, it™s Œ it™s a story, if 
you™re ready. 
Bergen-Belsen
 was a camp  for thousands of boys and girls, thousands 
of them. And we Œ you know how it was,
 there was nothing to do. There was 
nothing to do. You go again 
to eat lunch, you go ag ain 
to eat breakfast, you go ag ain 
eat. Was nothing. It was separated by 
Bergen-Belsen
 and five different camps: 
camp one, camp two, camp three, camp f
our. And each one ha
d about a thousand 
boys and girls or Œ or maybe 
mo re. You had to get a bicycl
e to travel somewhere, so 
after I was there six or seven mo nths, the 
Haganah 
came down, the Israeli hag Œ 
soldiers, maybe a hundred of them, dr
essed in civilian clothes, cause 
Bergen-Belsen
 
was under the Œ the eng Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ 
England™s
 occupation. No, not 
American, was 
England
, you know. And they started to get 50 people here in this 
room, 50 people here in this room, 60 peop
le here, or a hundred people here. And 
they used to talk to us
, what you should 
do. And nobody knew
 whether anybody 
survived . So  they used to 
say like this here; you, I™m gonna give you five postcards; 
you I™m gonna give five post Œ postcard
s. Write the name where the postcards 
should go, to your ho
metown; whether it™s 
Romania
, 
Czechoslovakia, 
or Œ o-or it™s 
Hungary
, or Œ or Œ o-or it™s in 
Poland
, or it™s in any of th
ese places. He says, I 
don™t care how long it™s gonna take to get th
ere, just write the name to go there. And

write not the name, just write to the city hall.
 This postcard should
 go to the city hall 
for 
Osovish
(ph) let™s say, to my  hometown. And 
in th e other side write, my  name is 
Ernie Pollak
. The first Jew who comes into the 
town , give him my  postcard. Don™t 
you think I wrote one day, I wrote next 
day. Ab out three months later I get a 
postcard from my  younger brother. 
Q: He had survived  
Auschwitz
, and Œ 

A: No, he was in 
Auschwitz
, but he Œ they  send him from 
Auschwitz
 to a camp, to 
a labor camp. And he says to me, your older 
brother is alive, and your older sister is 
alive, and they are in

had a girlfriend in 
Buda pest 
Œ he found her after the war because they were 
liberated in December, I think, ™44. He 
found her, they got ma
rried and theygot 
home, he went home, December 
[indeciphera ble]
 not in 
Budapest
, it was Œ well 
maybe to her hometown. And she had a baby girl, and sh e got very sick, she fell off 
a table, something with her foot
, she Œ and they had to  go to  
Vienna
. Later on, I 
don™t know when  this happened , maybe 
a year later, she had to go to 
Vienna
 when 
she was a year old, or three years old, in 
order to fix her leg. But while he was in 
Vienna
, he stood th ere already for a while, you know. And then he came to 
Bergen-
Belsen
. I don™t know Œ I don™t even 
rememb er why th ey came to 
Bergen-Belsen
, 
but he came to the 
United States
 after this. 
Q: So, and, of the re
st of your family? 
A2: Never came 
[indecipherable]
 
A: What? 

A2: Never came to Œ never came to 
Bergen  Œ 
I d Œ I don™t Œ 
A: No, I thought he didn™t come to 
Bergen-Belsen
, I don™t remember. 
Q: So, of the rest of your family Œ so that
™s three brothers. Did any of the other five 
siblings surv ive? 
A: No, no. It™s Œ it™s Œ as a 
matter of fact, when I got to 
Bergen-Belsen
, and I met 
him, yost Œ your Œ what™s his name? 
Gans
(ph)
, Gans
(ph), I met, from my

hometown, and the first thing he told me, 
I was with your father, and with your 
brother 
Moishe
(ph) in camp  together, but a few 
days before the liberation, they 
moved us from one place to the next place, 
and we had to walk 
and walk. And your 
brother went out of Œ ran Œ went out of line, 
Moishe
, and he ran to  a store, and Œ and 
the 
SS
 ran after him. But your father ran after 
him also, to bring him back, so I heard 
two shots. So they  must have shot both of them, cause only the 
SS
 came out, and 
your brother and father didn™t come out from 
that store. This is two days before the 
liberation. That™s all I know. 

Q: And the rest of your family you never heard? 

A: Because they were too 
young anyway, because I know
 my mother got killed in 
Auschwitz
 with the rest of the three or four
 sibling, a little girl. Because one was 
born 1930 Œ ™30, one was born 1938 Œ 

Q: And Œ 

A: Œ an-and one was born 1934. 
Q: And 
Bluma
(ph), who Œ she sat Œ 
A: 
Bluma
(ph) got married to our cousin 
[indeciphera b le]
 
Klausenb org
(ph). 
Q: Before the war. 

A: Befo Œ no Œ 
Q: Afterwards Œ

A: After Œ 
Q: Oh, so sh e did su rvive. 

A: After she was liberated, yeah
, after. This what he said to
 me, my ran Œ he Œ he™s Œ 
my  younger brother send me the message, says, 
Bluma
(ph) is home, and 
Dav id 
is 
home, you know. And he ha
d Œ the husband she married had three brothers in 
Israel
, 
so he wanted ju
st to go to 
Israel
. So they went to 
Israel 
Œ I think I was told, I™m not 
a hundred percent sure, I was told th
at she went with the Œ with the 
Ex odus
 boat, 
I™m not a hundred percent sure, but the 
Ex odus
 boat went in 1947. 
Q: Right.
 
A: And they wouldn™t let them into 
Israel
, so they Œ th ey Œ they went over Œ what is 
that Œ 

A2: Cyp Œ 

A: 
Cyprus
, they went into 
Cyprus 
for a year. Then when 
Israel 
became a state, 
they moved them into 
Israel
. 
Q: So when were you able to comm
unicate with her for the first time? 
A: When I was able to communicate with he
r the first time, that Œ I don™t Œ I don™t 
remember exactly when, I must have
, because my Œ yeah, because after 
Israel 
became a state, I was able  to communicate with her.

Q: And let us go back to 
[indecipherable]
 so how long did you stay in 
Berg en-
Belsen
? 
A: 
Bergen-Belsen
 I stood til 1949, September. 
Q: And then  Œ 
A: Then I came to the 
United States
. 
Q: And why did you decide to come to the 
United States
? 
A: Well, to me and my  younger brother, th
ere was somet h ing, you
 know Œ in 1934, 
o n e  o f  my  mo th er™s si sters Œ  my  mo th er
 had four sisters and two brothers in 
New 
York
. One of my  mo  Œ my  brother™s sisters came to my  hometo Œ our hometown, 
because my mother gave birth to a boy an
d she wanted to name him Œ to name the 
boy after her husband who 
died  in Œ in Œ in  
New Yo rk
. But the husband Œ in  Œ not 
new Œ yeah, but her husband 
had a brother in the small 
to wn Œ in the middle time, 
you know 
[indeciphera ble]
 brother. Now in the Jewish re
ligion, if you want Œ if the 
brother is alive, in the Orthodox religion,
 and if you have a boy an d you want to give 
his name 
[indeciphera ble]
 the person, hi-his wife has to get 
Halitzah
, separation. 
So whi Œ she came from 
New York 
to my  hometown Œ to our hometown , and he 
gathered the full synagogue and they made Œ the rabbi made 
Halitzah
, in other 
words a separation from her husband, who 
was dead, and this little boy can be 

named on his name. So this how I knew 
her, and th en you know, we se Œ my

younger brother said look, we
 have very no Œ whoever re
mained alive, your sisters 
went to 
Israel
. We have to wait to go to 
New York
 to see the rest of the family. And 
this is what we did. 
Q: Let me just ask a couple concluding
 questions. You began the interview by 
talking about your life before and that it 
was a very religious home and you were 
going to the synagogue every day. Did you
r attitude towards religion change as a 
result of the war? 

A: It™s Œ it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s a funny thing that
 you ask. We remained three brothers and 
a sister. My brother ma rried a cousin, and he
 was religious, but my  Œ my  Œ my  sister 
married a cousin and he 
was religious, the one in 
Israel
, and they observed 
everything religion Œ quite religion 
[indecipherable]
. My older brother became 
Orthodox also, because he wa
s Orthodox always, and he didn™t leave. So a matter of 
fact, I have a kosher home and sometimes he 
realized and he used 
to come and eat in 
my house. And at one time he realized th
at it might not be as kosher for certain 
reasons, I don™t know. Then  he says, I™m not 
going to  eat in your house again. So I 
went to 
Brooklyn
 and I brought in food fo r him, you know 
[indecipherable]
. But 
my  younger brother, 
Shlerma
(ph) Œ and I used to talk to
 him, you know, but I didn™t 
say anything; he became an atheist. So I says 
[indecipherable]
 someti mes, w h y .  He 
says, if God could stay up there and watc
h tw o million boys and 
girls as young as I

get killed, He didn™t do nothing, he says
, why should I believe in
 Him? I am relig Œ 
I™ll go Œ I go to synagogue, I sometimes re
ad the Torah sometimes here Œ here in 
new yor Œ in 
Wa sh ingto n
. 
A2: 
Leisure World
. 
A: 
Leisure World
. And we observe, we have 
a kosher home, but I™m not as 
religious as I should have been
, or Œ or as Œ and it Œ I f Œ I feel comfortable like this, 
you know. 
Q: And before we ask Œ then 
we ask, is there anything el
se you th ink is important to 
know before we conclude? How your earlie r experiences changed your life after the 
war, influenced the decisions you made after the war? 
A: Well Œ 
Q: Career-wise, family-wise, anything? 

A: Œ I Œ my family is Œ became my first,
 you know. I me t her not even a year I was 
in 
New York
, right? And then  we got married in 1952, yeah. 
Q: And then  we Œ a
nd your wife™s name? 
A: 
Lucy
. And th ank God, you kn
ow, we build  a nice hou Œ home. I have two 
children, a daughter and a son, and I have 
five grandchildren, three boys, and they 
all have a kosher home, you know. And my
 granddaughter in Œ my  Œ my  daughter 
belongs to 
[indeciphera ble]
 and my  older Œ my  gran
ddaughter, who™s already 17
