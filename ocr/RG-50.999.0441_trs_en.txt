T he Lodz ghetto wasform ed in February 1940.  Over 100,000 Jews  were f orced into less than 
two square m iles of neglected neighborhoods in the northern end ofthe city.  In the ghetto,Leon 

worked f orthe postal service, delivering letter s, m ilk and ration cards. T his photo shows m em bers of 
the ghettopostal service.  Leon is in thethird row, and he is right here, secondf rom the lef t.  So 
hopef ully you can seewhere he is based on the arrow.  
 
 
Oneof  Lodz's m ain streets passed through the ghetto and was keptopenf ornon
-Je wish  
comm erce.  So the Jews who lived in the ghettohad to cross that street on bridges likethis one.  
 
 
In 1944, Leon was taken to aforced labor cam p in Kielce, Poland. From  therehe was 
evacuated to the Buchenwald concentration cam p. T he arrow on this m ap of major Nazi cam ps in 
Europe points to Buchenwald.  
 
 
Th
reem onths later, Leon was sent tothe Flossenburg concentration camp. T his arrow on the 
m ap points to Flossenburg.  From there he was sent on adeathm arch.  Leon was liberated by US 
Forces in April 1945.  Weclose our slidepresentation with thisphoto of  Leonposing with friends soon 
af ter liberation.  Leon is on thefar right.  
 
 
Af ter the war, Leon workedf or the US Arm y in Germ any before coming to the United States in 
1949. W iththe $23 that he received upon arri val, hem ade a new life inWashington
,  DC.   He  wa s  
draf ted into the USArm y during theKoreanW ar. Eventually, Leon opened his own restaurant that he 
ranf ora quarter century.  Given its closenessto theW hite House, itwas a popular place, especially 
with the Secret Service who gave him  a party when he retired.  
 
 
Since his retirement in 1993, Leon and his wife Ninahave remainedin the W ashington area.

>> Leon Merrick:  OK. I was living in a sm allcity, the city of Lodz.  The population was 29,000.  3,000 
Jewish f am ilies.  My father was employed in the textile business.  Ihad a younger brother, three 
years younger.  My m other was a housewife. So the war brokeout 
Septem ber 1, 1939.  T he 
Germ ans cam e into our hometown Septem ber 7, only seven days later.  Right away, in Europe you 

start school inSeptember, just like in the United States, like everywhere,but we couldn't go back to 
school. My f ather losthis job. He couldn't go back to the factory.  
 
 
Not long afterwards, an announcem ent came outby word of m outh thatall of  the Jews in the 
city had to reportto the m ain market square. So we didn't know what todo.  My parents thought, 
Should we take clothes with us,f oods with us, are they going to letus comebackhom e? Should we 
takem y younger brother with us or leave him with our Polish neighbors?  
 
 
W edecided to go asafam ily to them arket square. W e walked, we sat down on the 
cobblestones, m aybe an hour o
r so, a guy cam eout, he announcedthis place is to be Jew
-
f r ee .   H e 
gave us threedays to leave.  So we couldn't take any furniture.W etook itto our Polish neighbors.  It 

was the laterpart of Septem ber. W e knew that England, France declared war on Germany, and we 
thought two big powers, Germany won't last long, we'd beableto com e back.  
 
 
Anyway, we called theneighbors, told them  they could have ourf urniture. Anotherneighbor 
hadthe horse and thewagon. W epacked up belongings, m ostly clothes. 
 
W e didn't takeany 
furniture.  And we went to the city of Lodz.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou gave thef urniture to the Christianneighbor, you thought you'dbe back?  
 
>> Leon Merrick: W ith the understanding, when the war is over, we' re going to take it back.  Didn't 

happen like that.

My m other had the sister in the next city, Lodz, L

alongside the wagon. We walked. Came to the city. W em oved inwith m y aunt. Af am ily of four, 
we're a fam ily of f our.  Weslepton thef loorfor six, seven weeks.  W hile we were there,they 
announced they're going to f orm  a ghetto in the city of  Lodz.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout the ghetto, a couple questions for you. W ere all the 

residentsof  your town, Zgier z, were they all sent to Lodz?  Did everybody go?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  No. At that tim e, they announced that theplacehas tobe Jew
-
f ree, everybody 
went his own wa y, wherever they had relatives.  Som e entered the city of  W arsaw.  Atonetim e,m y 

parents were talking about going to the city of W arsaw.  My m otherhada cousin. There is a tin 
factory.  Maybe we'll be safe with him .W e're lucky we didn't go toW arsaw.  We went tothe next city, 
Lodz.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you havefam ily in Lodz?  
 

>> Leon Merrick:  My m other's sister. Maybe her cousins, aunts,m y f ather's sister, all living in Lodz.  
 
 
OK, we went to the ghetto, and then hunger started setting in.  Everybody was hungry.  T he 
Jews started organizing as bestthey could. So they openedf actories, and they had a lot of 

tradesm en, had shoefactories andtailorf actories, we're going to produce materialfor theGerm ans, 
m aybe send in morefood orm aybethey'll leave us alone.  So everybody had to work, andit was 
im portantto work because ina place of em ploym ent you got anextra bowl of  soup.  My f ather knew, 
so he got a job as an orderly in the mainhospital.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he hospital in the ghetto?

>> Leon Merrick:  In the ghetto.  My m other got a job in the orphanage.  She got abowl o
f  soup there.  
I notice young peoplegoing around with satchels, delivering m ail.  Isaid to m y parents, Maybe I can 
do a job likethis. If  I wasn't going to school, Jews were not allowed to go to school.  My f ather talked 
to som ebody, he told him ,W rite 
a petition.  
 
He wrote a letter, Ihave a young son, at thattim e I was already 16 years old.  I was 
called to the personnel office.  Inoticed inthe petition thatthe letter which he wrote a big R initial by 
thehead of the ghetto.  I got a job, so I got extra bowl of
 
soup.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou first toldm e you workedfor the postal service, I was sort off labbergasted 

there was apostal service in the ghetto,becauseI wouldn'thave thought mail could go inandout.  
T ell us what the postalservice did and why
 
there was m ail.  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  OK. Talking about 1940. Thef irstm onthsof 1940. T here was a post off ice, a 

workin g post off ice.  You hada lot of  Jews f rom the city of Lodz wh ere I was born. T hey went to the 
Soviet occupied zone.  At thattim e, if  you know, Germ any m adea nonaggression pact with the 
Germ ans,and with the Soviet
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson: T heywere Allies?  
 

>> Leon Merrick:  Sowe had mail. T henat that tim e, it's bef orethe Germansoverrun France and 
Belgium , theBenelux countries.  Asidef rom  that, when they f orm edthe ghetto, the Germ ans picked 
them ost dilapidated section, rat infested,bedbugs.  Youhad som e Jews interm arriaged to non
-
Je ws.   
T he otherpartners decided to com e into the ghetto too, to be with the spouses.  Def initely outside

>> Leon Merrick:  Yeah, andf rom SouthAmerica, all theseneutralcountries. T hey didn'tdeclare war 
on Germ any. W ehada working post off ice.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You just toldus having a jobwas so im portant in term s of getting that extra bowl of 

soup.  Your brother though was too young towork, ri ght?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  My brother was too young to work, so we had to share with him.  You get a little 

m ore, extra bowl of  soup, so he got an extra

but later he got a job too.  Later on,he gota jobtoo.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou toldm e that atone point there were almost 160,000 Jews com pressed 

into this two square m ile area with over 90f actories producing goods for the Germ ans.  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  Less than two square m iles.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Eventually, I think you said,m orethan 200,000 would pass through there?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  Once the Germ ans overrun the countries in Europe, theBenelux countries,
 
Holland,Belgium , Luxem bourg, they rounded up the Jews in the center, theBenelux countries, the 
center,the Lodz ghetto, it was an assembly pointfor the time being,until they decided to do away 
with the Jews.  
 
 
T hey were taking out transportf rom  the 
ghetto all the tim e.  In 1942, the Germans ordered the 
curfew.  Nobody couldgo in.  You hadto stay.  Nobody could go intothehouses. The Germans went 

f rom house to house, they blockedoff the streets. Everybody had to com e to the courtyards, but if  
th
ere was no courtyard come to the street,and you stood there.  I could see the wom en putting on 
the rouge to lookhealthy.  At that tim e, they took away 15,000 children f rom the ghetto, and elderly.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  15,000 children and elderly.

>> Leon
 
Merrick: T hey took them  to an assem bly point, but we didn't know.  For thef irst tim eI heard 
about the gas cham bers in 1942.  I was worki ng in the post off ice. Iwas sitting there, som ebody told 
the story what he heard.  I don't know where, buthe said
 
he heard it, they take the people,the 
people, they tookf romthe ghetto.  Give them a towel, piece of soap,they go to the showers and 

instead of water gas is com ing out. I didn't think anything about it. I didn'tbelieve it. T hat's what they 
said.  
 
 
Later, in 1943, they had a Catholic church in the ghettoand it was padlocked. 1943, they 
openedthe padlocks,the Germ ans openedthe padlocks,they were bringing clothes to theghetto. 
T hey took the local Jews to sort outthe clothes.  Sometimes a letter fell out, or IDfell out. W eknow 
those are theID cards f rom  thepeople who just lef t the ghetto.  Some clothes were bloodied. T he 
Germ ans took the Jews to sort it out,andthen the good clothes to sendto Germany.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Leon, hunger was
 
so ever present, and you toldm e that som etim espeople would be 
able to geta prescription from a doctor within the ghettof or potatopeels.  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  Yeah. The hunger was sobad, and people lost weight, and they got sick, you 

know.  T hey went to the doctor, if  you know a f riendly doctor, he wrote you prescriptionforpotato 
peels,becausethey had comm unity kitchens. W e had, you got theone soup aday. T hewom en 
usedtof indout which kitchenpeelsthe potatoes thick, sothey went to the kitchen, you wash them  
out,took out the dirt,there wasn't much left.  
 
 
As am atter off act, I saw an accident, somebody cam e outf rom  thekitchen with apackof  
soup, collectedfor his fam ily, then all of a suddena boy jum ped thewom en.  It was a big tussl

W hat happened?T hebowl fell, the soup spilled. On the sidewalks.  The boy just spreadsout,and 
licks up the soup, whatever was left, on the sidewalk.  Hard to believe, isn't it?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Leon, oncethe deportationsbegan, in 1943, and of course theSoviets and the 

Germ ans becam eenem ies andthe mail servi ce stopped, what was your role primarily af ter that time 
in the postal service?  
 
>> Leon Merrick: W ell, we were deliver ing

OK, sof rom  the beginning of the ghettotheGerm ans

bodiedm en to workf or Germ any.  I remember young m en, we had neighbors, get up 
early, 4:00,5:00 inthem orning, they had theGerm anm edical comm ission, and they're looking if  

they're healthy, andthe Jewish comm unity som ehow they paid thefam ilies
 
in Germ an scrip money.  
T hey had their own money.  So we were delivering that.T hen we were delivering notices to report to 

the town square. T heGerm ans always dem anded people. T hey had tofeed theexterm ination cam p.  
You had the cam ps, whatever it is, so we delivered thenotices to reportf or work,f or theassem bly 
points.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're now delivering notices?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  Notices.  Forexam ple, I'llgi ve you an example. It's wintertim e, cold outside.  I 
have a noticeto somebody going to European houses, you had the building, go into the hall way, and 
I have a certainnam es and address. I knockon thedoor,nobody answers.  I heard afaint voice f rom  
behind the curtain,because if the door was, now it's a curtain,because the people took outthe 
wooden doorforf irewood.  There isa curtain there, I hear afaint voice.  I put the curtain aside. I

T hey're hungry.  Nothing to lookf orward to.And I didn't have goodnews f or them . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Leon, your m other, as you said, got a job in the orphanage. Whathappened toher
 
job?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  In 1942 also,m y father
 
--
 
I'm  going back.  My f ather worked in the hospital, and the 
Germ ans cam e and rounded up,tookall thepatients out. Then they went to the orphanage where 
m y m other used to work, took all of the children out. Som y m other had no job there. W edidn't 
know.  T he rum or was going around, they take the sick people to sanatorium or the kids tosendto 
school.W e know now where they took them ,they tookthem all to the gas cham ber, killed them all.  
 
>> B ill B
enson:  You wouldexist in theLodz ghettof oraboutfour years.  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  Yes, 1944.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about the circum stances that led to your removal f rom  theLodz ghetto and 

where you went f rom  there.  
 
>>
 
Leon Merrick:  In 1944, m y job wasn't essential. Atthat time,becausethe ghetto started up with 
161,000 people, thenthey bring in m ore people, atone time oranother, 200,000people inthe ghetto. 
Now they were em ptying the ghetto.  In 1944, the ghetto only had 78,000 people.  I got anotice to 
reportfor a transport.  1944, I was 17 years old, and so atthat time the Soviets already chased the 
Germ ans backf rom  Stalingrad, the Russians, theSoviets are com ing closer to our borders.  Maybe 
one of  thes
e days we'r e going to be liberatedby the redarm y.  Ididn't reportfor the transport.  I was 
hiding.  
 
 
T hen they took m y ration card away. W hatever was lef tover, m y father didn't have the jobin

thehospital anymore, m y mother didn't getthe extra bowl of  soup, so maybe m y parents talk to other 
people,W hat should we do? T hey said,W ell, theboy is 17 years old. T hey're not going to kill him .  
Maybe they only want him  for work.  
 
 
My m other packed upa rucksack, sweater, extra pants,underwear, extra
 
socks, and I reported 
to assembly point. I reported tothe assem bly point, and I got there,I see peoplehurting them selves.  

T hey didn't want to go in the transports. They're walking around to wires, puncturing your eardrum s.  
If you have no hearing, how can you go to work?  Som ebody cutting them selves, maybe making a 
hernia. How are you going to lif t things?  You're supposed to gotowork.  
 
 
Anyway, af terthree,four days, they march us to the train station.  Ihadmy rucksack.  Iputthis 
in the cattle cars.  Closed the trains.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you go on,did you get to say goodbye to your parents?  
 
>>
 
Leon Merrick:  Sure, when I left the house, I said goodbye. Thenm y father came to seem eone 
m oretim e.  I was already behindbarbed wire.  From far away.  It was March 1944.  Still cold in 

Poland.  You had a3/4 pea jacket, high boots, I hadearmuff s. 
 
T hat's the last tim e I have seenhim .  
 
 
Don't evenhave apicture of m yf am ily.  I don't. W hatever I remember the last tim eI saw them 
it's printed inm y m ind.  No picture of m y m other, m yf ather,m y younger brother.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hey locked you in the transport?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  Locked m e in the transport.  Af ter riding several hours, train stopped, opened up, 
we cam e out, guardswere waiting there. T hey told us to climb the tracks.  Ihadthis rucksack.  I said,

I never seen it. W hatever I had onm e, that'sit. T hey took usto a cam p.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had on you som e pictures, right?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  At that time I had everything, pictures, letters,addressesf rom  relatives. My m other
 
hada sister in France,cousins in Holland.  After the war we'd m eet.All in my pockets.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T heir addresses?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  Everything, sure.  So we got to this cam p, they didn't give me the rucksack. T hey 
tookus to the cam p. There were already Jews in the cam p.  The next m orning, they m arched us 
under guard to work, to thef actory nearby. OK? W ecam e in contact with non

Jews over there. W e 
Jews, we cam e underguard every day, work ed inthef actory. W hen the shift was over, the

m archedus back under guard. T he non

Jews went back to their home. W e know what was going 
on. A lot of people were dreading, if  you hada nice sweater, socks,extra pants, a guy canbring you 

a loaf of bread.  I had nothing to trade.T hey didn't give
 
m e ru cksa ck b a ck.  
 
 
W hile in this camp, Iheard about the Norm andy invasion, June 1944.  Iheard about the 
invasion, the Allies invasionof  France.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  How did you hearaboutthat?  
 

>> Leon Merrick: T hey came together with the Poles. Th

Jews.  T hey heard on the radio. In 
this cam p,at that point, it was going backf or the Germ ans, Soviets and the Russians, whatever you 

call them , they're com ing closer to the camp. The guards com eone m orning, they saidpack up. I 
had nothing to p

" You're Jews?  You'rehere to help us win the war?"   
 
 
W hat do we tell them? Keep your mouth shut. T oldthem nothing.  
 
 
T he next m orning, they tookus out to the countryside, they gave us picks and shovels, and we

can you dig ditches?T he guard shrugged the shoulders.W e asked, "W hy can't you takeus back to 
the ghetto we just came f rom ?" T hey told usthe ghetto isbeing liquidated. This in July.  
 
 
W efinished digging, they took ustoanother camp in Poland. W e worked in thef actory 
another couple months.  The sam eas the previous f actory, m aking bootsfor the Germ an arm y.  
 
 
Like Im entioned, the war was going back for theGermans. T he guards came one day, "Pack 
up, on the double, to the train 
station." T heym arched us to the train station. W e canhear the local 
population, they were r unning "The Russiansare com ing!"  InPolish, of  course.W e'ref rom  Poland; 
we understood it.  But we'd beenunder guard.  
 
 
T hey locked us up in cattle cars.  W e didn't know where they were t aking us. W e just hada

Anyway, af ter riding abouteight days, the cattle car stopped,opened thedoor, sun. T he sun

Buchenwald."   I know exactly where I was.  I see the Nazif lag f lying.  Afterf ive m inutesorhe so, the 

guards came out," Onthe double, line up, colum n of f ive."  T hey m arch us to them ain gate, which is 
af am iliar sign, "W orkm akes youf ree."  I didn't getf ree yet.  
 
 
W e're in the big hallway, the hallway was this big thing.  Everybody undress, puteverything on 
the table.  At that tim e, I had addresses, pictures of m y fam ily.  Once I put everything on the table, 
whatever I rem em bered, no pictures, everything on the table, I stood naked, and I told youguys, they 
didn't give us clothing.  I worked in thefactory, the machines, running oil.  I developedblisters onm y

downstairs, they must have had 30 guards there, they all had scissors.  They shaved our head, 
underneath thearm s,ever ywhere. T hey wer e inmates like I was, but they already had a job inthe 
cam p. W e were the new arrivals.  
 
 
Af ter this was f inished, they ledus into another room, and they hadthe big basin, looks like 
disinf ecting water, like pool water. W ehad to subm erge.  Don'tforgetm y blisters here. I submerged, 

it was burning like thedevil.  
 
I stood up, I noticedthe next room ,the door is ajar.  I seeall the shower heads. I'm in a 
concentration cam p, I knew that. I'm under guard. I'm naked,no clothes.  I wentto the shower.  I 
walked in thenext room , the water is not running yet, butthe whole room of the shower head, I stood 
in the
 
shower head,and another guy com es in, he stood, thena third guy com es in.  Now we start 
tussling.  Everybody wants a better spot. T he water starts running,because everybody is burning.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  From the disinfectant?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  From
 
the disinfectant.  Now the water starts running a little bit, so we're happy, 
we're still ali ve at thatpoint. T his wasf inished, I walked into thenext room . There was a guy, he had 
a pad,paper,m y name, he writes out whereI comef rom , your profession.  I said I was astudent,17 
years old.  He writes it all down.  Goes to the third guy in the next room , I guess, gave me ajacket, 
plain jacket, notthe stripedpajam a jackets, just plain.  Gavem epants.  No socks, no underwear.  
 
 
Go to the third guy,
 
I can see he has wooden clogs.  I see one clog is notthe sam e size.  I 
said, when I got to him, "T hey're not going tof it."   
 
 
" I sa y th e yf it. Ne xt!"

com es out, af unctionary in the cam p,not a guard,one of the prisoners too, but he already has a job 
in the cam ps. He says " Forward m arch," andthey led us into a barrack.  It was adark barrack.  One 
windo w, onenaked light bulb and shelves.  At that point,they're looking for volunteers. Two 
volunteers to go tothem ain kitchen andbring soup and breadfor the new transfers. T hatm eansfor

A couple guy volunteers, they're gone10, 15m inutes, come back wi th abig kettleof  soupand

bowl, because we didn't bring a bowl. W ooden bowl with a spoon. Gave a bowl of  soup.  I atethe 
soup.  I thought I'm  going to eat thebread later.  By theevening, I put down m y hand, somebody 
swiped the bread.  
 
[Laughter]
 
T here was nobread. T o this day, I don't remem ber.  I had a regular jacket. I got ahold ofneedle and

the Germansadm inistered the camp, the guards outside. T he main station were the Germ ans, the 

m ilitary, the unif orm s.  Insidethe cam p was run by the inm ates. Talking about the 1937
-
38,  t h at ' s  
bef ore the Germ ans, the European countries were conquered. 
 
So who was in the cam ps?  Jehovah witnesses, Germ an crim inals. W ehad the

up the

Leon Merrick:  In charge.  The commoners had the red label.  AllGerm an. That'sbefore they 
conquered the territory.  Later on, Auschwitz andAustria in 1938, itwas the Austrian population, they 

were old. T he greensrun the cam p, the crim inals.  Som ehow in 1942, the reds took it over.  That

W as that Buchenwald?  Herb Lewis?  
 
>> Leon Merrick:  OK,Herb Lewis, I met Herb Lewis in Poland. I didn't know him before. It was in 
oneof  the labor camps.  He wasn'tf rom m y hom etown.  He was not
 
in the Lodz ghetto. Imet him  in 
the labor cam p.  He cam efrom a different city.  He becam e close,more or less. W e worked not in 

the samem achine,but we workedf or the sam efactory. T hen theGerm ans came to round usup,on 
the double, to the train st
ation.  I wenttogether with him too. W e woundup in the sam e cattle car.  
 
Oncehe gotoff the cattle car, you know how i t is, the guard says, " Column of f ive, 
column off ive,"  he wound up in adiff erentbarracks, I woundup ina different barrack. But I'd see him  
ever y day outside.  
 
 
T hen we had to leaveBuchenwald. W e hooked up togetheragain. W e went together. T he 
next thing, they took us to the train station inopen cattle cars

>> Bill Benson: T he reason they took you out of  Buchenwald, because the Allies are getting close?  
 
>> Leon Merrick: T heAllies are com ing, theSoviets are com ing.  One side beforethe Battle of  the 
Bulge. T he Am ericans are landing.  First they tookout the Jews.  But they saidall the Jews 
assemble. Didn't want to go inthe Jews transport. They said they'll  gi ve you right awa y.  I was hiding 
for two days underneath the barracks.  Somebody caughtm e there,gave m e a kick. Ithurt several 
days.  I couldn't sit down.  Not the Germ ans, butone of the orderlies. They want to save their own 
skin, you know.

they m archedus to the city of W eim ar,nearBuchenwald.  They hadthe railroad through there, put us 
in open cattle car.  Once in cattle car, I couldn't sit down.  All of a sudden, the
 
siren startswailin g, you 
can see the guard. T hen we hearthe clear signal, the train startsmoving.  
 
By that point, we got shot down

Allies planes were all over the trains, shooting down.  
T he guardsencouraged this to wave to the attacking planes. 
 
Tell them the guards are doing the 
shooting.  Even at this stage, we don't want to die. W hoever had a jacket,took off the jacket, waved 
to the planes.  Some people had hats, took itoff  to wave.  T he planes came so low, I couldsee the

Something hit me inmy f ace.  I turned to m yfriend, af ellow walker.  W ebecame close.  I turned to 
him , I said, " Am I bleeding?"   He looksatm e, " No, you're not bleeding."   
 
I turnaround,I see a wooden sign there like crossroador crossing.  I thinkm aybeone of  
the splinters hit m yf ace, but notenough to cause bleeding.

through his pockets.  Maybe
 
he's got cigarettes,m aybe a crumb ofbread, maybe his shoes are better

Ever ybody goes back in.  Then we m ightbewalkin g m aybe another few m inutes, but people are

W ecame to another cam p, Flossenburg.  Not long, two, three days, it was closed,evacuated

couldn't get up. The guard told them ,"W hy don't you wake them up?"  The guard com eswith the rif le

But theAllies were close by.W edidn't know i t was thunder. Peoplewere walking out.  A shothere,a

T he last night, m y knee

Poland, I saidm aybe I should go rest nearby. He said, " You go, you're going to get shot." He said, 
"W hy don't you stay in the m iddle?  Don't go to the side.  Lean on me."  I don't know i
f  i leaned on him

W e walked inthe ghetto.  Cam e in them orning to a village.  T he guards told us,"W e're 
going to arrest you."  They left us in abarn. The nightbefore it was raining.  Our clothes were

Finally, the door opened up, and I can see all, I'm  going out, I see every Germ anhouse

white f lag is hanging.  People, there was a Germ an truck there who followed proper provisi ons, 
followed theGerman guards. People going to the truck,taking jackets, pants, even rags.  
 
I went to thetruck, I took leather boots.  Ihad no socks.  I co
uldn't take them off  later on.  
I had to cutthem off .  At thatpoint, I see a lady with a kid,a Germ an woman, she had a kid.  I guess 
the kid was for protection, because som any thousandsof people just got eliminatedf rom  the 
concentration cam ps.  She h
ad a sm all baby. Has abig blanket.  Everybody stayed in line. She 
gi ves m e a piece of bread.  I go to them ain road, I see trucks, tanks, they're throwing C

Next thing, we're walking and we com e intoa house inthe village.  My f riend says, "W hy

W e're liberated, but I don't know.

All of  a sudden, they took usf irstonassem bly point, then we were ready.  Tookus to the

T hen the ship
 
startsmoving f urther, past theStatue of Liberty, so close I could almost reach her. At
