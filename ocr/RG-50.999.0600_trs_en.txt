presentation to help wi th his intro

Peter Gorog was borninto a Jewish fam ily inBudapest, the capitalof  Hungary, in 
March 1941,as PeterGrunwald. He changed hisf am ily nam e in 1962 toGorog.T he arrow on 

this mapof  Europe points to Hungary.
 
 
On thisnext map,thearrow points t
o Budapest.
 
 
Peter'sfather, Arpad Grunwald, worked as an off icem anager at apublishing house 
while his m other, OlgaSchonfeld, worked asa hat makerand raised Peter.T his was the last 

picture of thefam ily together. Peter was 3months old.
 
 
P e te r's fa th
er was conscripted to work in theHungarian Forced Labor Battalion 
beginning in 1940 because as a Jew, he was considered" undesirable" f orarmed service by 

the Hungarian governm ent.
 
Here is aphotoof  the Forced LaborBattalion. Thearrow points to 
Peter's
 
father, Arpad.In 1942, Arpad was sent to Ukraine to work wit h a labor battalionandhe 
died in Ukraine.Peter andhis mother remained inBudapest during this time.

In March1944, Germ anforces invaded Hungary. Peter and hism other were evicted 
f rom  their apartm ent and went into hiding wit h a Christianf am ily. Afew days af ter, aneighbor 
denounced them .
 
TheHungarian gendarm erie, or police,arrested Peter's mother and puther 
in  ja il.
 
This is an historic photographf rom October
 
1944 of Jewish wom en in Budapest arrested 
by Hungarian police.
 
 
T wo days af terher arrest, Peter'sm other escaped and she andPeter m oved intoan 
apartm ent safeguarded by Swedish diplom at RaoulW allenberg. Later theyf led toa Budapest 

ghetto where they live d with som e of Peter'sother relatives until the end of  the war. In January, 

1945, Budapest was liberated by the SovietArm y.
 
 
In 1946, Peter'sm other m ade plansfor them to em igrate to the United States. T his 
picture isf rom  their passport. In 1949, while they were waiting f or their visa, the Com munist 

governm ent of Hungary closed the borders. As a result, Peter grew up in Hungary.
 
 
In 1980, Peter def ected to the United States.He worked for more than 30 years at 
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center inGreenbelt, Maryland.
 
 
Although 
Peter's Mother had attem pted to em igrate to the U.S. right after the war, they 
were unableto leave and lived under the comm unist governm ent until Peter's def ection in 

1980.
 
W hile in Hungary, Peter was eventually able toattenduniversity and he earneda 
M
aster's degree in Electrical Engineering. He was part of  theteam thatbuilt thef irst computer 
designed completely by Hungarians.
  
 
His educationand experiencem ade itpossiblef or Peter to rem ain and work in the 
U.S.f ollowing his defection until he receivedhis green cardand later becom ea U.S. citizen.
 
Peter, who retired in2014, spent34 years inthe computerf ield in the U.S. spending mostof  

his tim e at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, wherehe worked on 

such m ajor project
sas LANDSAT ,the Hubble SpaceTelescope, the SpaceShuttle,and the 
Jam esW ebbT elescope, which is tobe launched in 2018.
 
 
Following his retirem ent, Peterbecam e more actively in vol ved with this m useum  and 
began volunteering here. He translates docum ents
 
written in Hungarian and video testimonies 
of  Holocaust survi vors and eyewitnesses.
 
Peter is a tour guidefor the museum 'sPermanent 
Exhibition, leading tours for U.S. law
-
enf orcem ent groups, and studentsf rom m any states. He 
describeshis work as "ver y e
m otional."
 
 
Peterand his wif e, Jorgy, li ve in Maryland just outsideof W ashington, DC. T hey have 
four daughters: Sarah,Laura, Anna, and Ilana. They lost their daughter Juliana when she was 

just 2 years old. Peter's daughter, Veronika,from  hisearlier marriage in Hungary, li ves in 

Northern Virginia with her husbandand her two daughters: Monica, age 9and Katalina, age 7. 

T hey are a very close
-
k n it  f am ily.
 
 
In addition to our 
F irs t  P e rs o n
 
program ,Peter speaks publicly at other settings about 
his Holocaust experience. Hehasbeen sharing hisf am ily's history with m ilitary, high school 

and college groups, recently speaking at theUniversit y of  Northern Iowa, anda synagogue in 

Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.
 
 
W ith that, I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our First Person,Peter Gorog.

[Applause]

B ill B e n s o n
: 
Peter, thank you som uch for joining us today and your wil lingness to be here 
as our First Person.W e have just an hour and you have really so much to share with us.W e'll 

try to get to as muchof it as we can while you're here with us.
 
 
Let's startf irst, Peter, talking about yourf am ily and your ver y early life, yourf am ily 
particularly.W orldW ar II began when Germ any and Russia invaded Poland in 

3 
 
September
 
1939. Bef ore we talk about the war and the Holocaustand what happened to your 
fam ily during the war, tell us about yourf am ily before the war, what you can about them .
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
I camef rom  a Jewish fam ily, both sides. On m y mother's side, she cam efrom 
a very Orthodox f am ily. My great
 
grandf atherwas a rabbi in a small town which is now in 
Slovakia. My f ather's side was less observantJewish f am ily, ver y sim ilar to conservative 
Judaism  in the UnitedStates.
 
 
My f ather was born in1907. Heaspired tobe a lawyer. Unf ortunately it didn't
 
happen 
because startingf rom 1920,m uch earlier than in Germ any, there was a very strict restricti ons 

on Jewish persons entering into higher education institutions. He tried and he tried and 

unf ortunately he was not admitted. And theonly reason was because he was Jewish.
 
 
My m other, as you mentioned, was ahatmaker.W ehad a relatively com fortable 
m iddle class lif e in Budapest before the war.Unfortunately the anti
-
Jewish la ws were getting 
stricter and stricter. My father losthis job, so they relied on m y mom 's income only. And later in 

1940,m y m om  was already pregnant with m e when he was conscripted into the Hungarian 

labor
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforewe turn to that, a littlebit more about your mother, if you don't mind. 
You described to me she was the
 
black sheep of  her fam ily.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
I wasn't surethat this wouldcom e up. [Laughter]
 
In a way, yes. As I said, she 
cam ef rom  a very observant Orthodox f am ily. Shenever turned away f rom  Judaism .She just 

didn'tfollow the strict laws. Onef am ily
 l
ore is theday before the wedding she wenttom ake her 
hair prettyf or the wedding f orgetting thatthere is a Jewish custom that on theday of  the 

wedding, the bride goes to the ritual bath where shehas to be immersed into water com pletely. 

So her f ather 
rem inded her
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Af ter she hadher hair done.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Aftershe hadthe beautiful hair done. And it was messedupaf ter it. But there 
was still enough time before the wedding tomake her pretty.
  
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Peter, you described
 
tom e thatf or your parents, they reall y led a very norm al 
lif e up till 1939. T hey had non
-
Jewishf riends. They were active in the com munity.W hat were 
som e of the things they did, f rom  what you know? 
 

>> Peter Gorog:
 
T hey were very acti ve. T hey loved outdooractivities. During the summ er they 
went kayaking on theDanube River. In the winter they went skiing. T hey belonged toa sports 

club which was by that tim e, because of the discrim ination, restricted for Jews only. Jews c ould 

not join any kindof organization which was not set upf or Jewish people.They went to 

theaters, concerts, movies. T hey loved movies.
 
So, yes, they had a relatively norm al life.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A l t ho ugh  
W orldW ar II began in Europe in Septem ber of  1939, thefull brunt of 
the war and the massdeportation of Jews in Hungary didn't occuruntil 1944. Nonetheless, as 

you startedto tell us, conditions hadbeen getting worse and worse for Jews even going back 

to the 1920s. But after 1939 they got increasingly worse, even though thefull b
r u nt of  t he wa r  

didn't come to Hungary, including your f ather beingf orced into a labor battalion.T ell us what 

you can about the circum stancesf or yourf am ily once the war began in1939 andthen your 

father being sent to a labor battalion.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Yes, the Holocausthistory alittle bit differentf rom  the restof Europe because 
Hungary wasn't occupied until 1944by the Nazis. Nevertheless, 
anti
-
Sem itism was as rampant 
in other countries andthe Hungarian government 
" t
ook care"  of the Jews. T he anti
-Je wish  
laws between 1938 and 1940 made life alm ost im possiblefor Jews.
 
My f ather had to go to the 
forced labor camp. Jews were not trusted tohave weaponsor rif les or handguns so they were 

4 
 
doing all the dirty jobs for theArm y. 1941, theNazi Germ any attacked the Soviet Union and 
because Hungary was the ally of  Nazi Germany
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And on that point, Peter, that's a really critical point,the reason that Hungary 
wasn't occupied by the Germans was because they were such a strong ally of  the Naz
is .
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
T hat's correct.T hat they corroborated with the Nazis all the way until the end 
of  t he  wa r .
 
 
So going backtom y father's story, he was taken to the
 
forced labor cam p. He was 
m ovedf rom one cam pto another andanother until 1942.T he Forced Labor Battalionm oved 

into Ukraine with the Hungarian Arm y where outof  the100,000 Hungarian Jewish m en 

between the age of  18 t
o 55, out 
of  the 100,000, 40,000 di
e d.  
 
 
Some of them died becauseof the war activities but many of  them  died because of the 
inhum ane circum stances they were in.W e know f rom the mem oirs and testimoniesof people 

who survi ved that during the winter, the harsh Russian winter, temperaturesa
re m inus 

40
 
degrees, the snow is knee
-
high,they didn't have other clothesorshoes, and they hadto 
m arch in those circumstances andm any of them just were too weak and couldn't m arch any 

longer. If  they stopped m ore than three or f our m inutes, they f roze
 
to death. T hose who didn't 
but couldn't keepup the pace with the troops, they were shot by theoff icers, Hungarian 

off icers, on the spot. So many of  them  perished this way.
 
 
W edon't know exactly what happened tom y father.Inearly 1943m y m om  gota 
not
if icationf rom the Hungarianm inister of defense thatm y f ather was am issing person. And 
later on he was declared dead.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
During the tim ethat you know that he was with the labor battalions, did your 
m other have any ideaof where he was? Tell us about her comm unication with him , particularly 

a little bit about the postcards.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Ihave with m e oneof  them any postcardsm y father sentf rom thef orced 
labor cam p. Idon't know if  it canbe seen. My father tried to jam  as many informa
tion as 
possible into the little spacehehad. He could not wherehe was because it was a m ilitary 

operation.The cards them selves were censored, sohe couldn't write about the circum stances. 

So the only thing he wrote about,how hefelt,how he m issedm y m om  orhem issed me, and 

how he hoped that thegood Lord would help them one day, that we are going to be reunited.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you have several of those postcards.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Ihave several of  the postcards. Iam in the process of  translating
 
it fo r m y 
children. I autom atically plan todonate it to the museum becausethey can take better care of  

it. 
 
 
So is with m y m om 's diary. M y m om  started writing down her m em ories and what was 
happening inthef am ily and specif ically with m e in the hope that one day m yf ather would 

com e back and she was able to recall the little m inordetailsf rom m yf irst words orm y sill y 

sentences, whatf ood I liked and what I didn't.
 
At onepoint, it's very ironic, she wrote that when 
I took abath, I was scream ing and I didn't want to because I was af raid of water. And lateron 

in m y lif e I becam e a com petitive kayaker. I did everything on the water.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That just m ust be so incredibly precious to you to have that.People afterwards 
when they talk to you, when we f inish theprogram , perhapsthey m ight get a glim pse of that. 

On the littlepostcard therem ust be 25 lines,ver y sm all handwriting to get everything your 

father could possibly get on there.
 
 
Onem ore thing about that. Do you m ind,Peter, sharing the
 
term  of endearm ent that 
he hadfor your mother? He would addressthose?
 

5 
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Yes.She was called by m y father" My little squirrel" . In Hungarian,for one 
reason, I don't know, like cats in this country, thatthey are very popular. And that was the way 
he addressedher in the postcards.
 
 
I don't know if  Ihave a little tim e to quotea coupleof  thingsf rom m y m om 's diary.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Absolutely. Please.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
It give s you a little glim pse of people and specif ically m y m om felt throu
gho u t  
those years and alsothe em otional roller coaster she wentthroughfrom  expressing her loss to 

displays, f rom  consolation to hopeand determ ination to survive.
 
 
So with her words,f irst abouther lo
ve
 
f orm y father." Youhave no idea how m uchI 
long 
to see you.T he thought of seeing you and having you next tome drives m e to insanity. 
W hy the goodLordpunishesm e som uch that the oneI adore them ost is separatedf rom m e 

for sucha long tim e."
 
 
Andf rom  love she went down todesperation." I cannot standthis horrible situation 
thatI am having a nervous breakdown. I try to controlm yself. And Itry to believe that you are 

not in any trouble. You haven't hadthe opportunity to write."
 
Obviously she wrote it after a long 
tim e shedidn't hearf rom  him .
 
 
And something which is ver y preciousf orm e. Probably this is wh y I'm  here because 
she hadthis determ ination to survive regardle ss of  the circum stances. And this is what she 

wrote. " Your little girl is  strong and the good Lord listenstom y everyday prayers that we wil l be 

united soon.I have to rem indm yself  all thetim ethat I should not be bitter ordesperate asI 

have tobe strong so our livelihood of  survi val  wil l be secured."
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thankyou for sharing those,Peter.W esaw in the pictures earlier that your 
father was able to come one tim e to see you.Say a little bitaboutthat.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Yes. I was about 3m onthsold when he was 
ab l e
 
to come homefor a long 
weekend. Andthat's when the picture was taken. Unfortunately I do nothave any personal 

m em o r y of m y f at h e r .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Of  course.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
I  ju s t
 
--
 
I don't even rem em ber his hugs and kisses. Butf rom the cards, I know 
how m uchhe loved me and that gave me strength throughout the years growin g up.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And inlight of what your mother was writing, the desperation shef elt yet 
because she was so resilient, she had to continuetom ake endsm eet, provide ahom efor you. 

How did shem ake ends m eet during thetimethathe was goneand,of  course, got word tha
t 
he had died? 
 

>> Peter Gorog:
 
As you said, she was a hatm akerfor ladies. Andhats were very popular in 
the 
`
30s and 
`
40s. Soshem ade a good living. She set up her shop in ourapartm ent.One 
room  was set asidef or her work.
 
 
I do remember
 
--
 
a ga i n,  I  w
as only 4 years old when the Budapest ghetto was 
liberated but I still have personal mem ories that w
hen m y m om  m ade som e beautif ul hats for a 
wedding, I was thef irst one totry it
, p
rance inf ront of them irror. Unfortunately thattim e there 
were no instant cam eras and Idon't have picture of it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Peter,as hard as conditionswere, as you've described it,f or Jews in Hu
nga r y 
generally lif e becam e profoundly worse when the Germ ans occupied Hungary in March 1944. 

Brief ly tell us why they occupied, just very brie f ly, why they occupied Hungary that late in the 

war and then what that m eantfor you and your fam ily.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
It was a com bination of at least two things. Num ber one, by that time the 
Germ an troops were retreatingf rom  thethen Soviet Unionand they had to gothrough 

6 
 
Hungary to get back to Germany. TheSovietArm y was chasing them . But theultimate reason 
was that by 1944,a year before the war actually ended,the Hungarians realized that they were 

on the losing side of this war and they wanted to getout.T he Germans wanted to keepthem  

in. Sothey occupied Hungary and installed agovernm ent which although the previous 

governm ents were very loyal to Nazi Germ any but they
 
--
 
the Nazis l ost conf idence in the 
governm ent andthey installed theirown people.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W as this what they called theArrow Cross? 
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Later on
 
--
 
the occupationhappened in March1944. The situation got worse 
and worse. Andby October, the Hungarianfar right Nazi Part y, theArrow Cross, took over the 

governm ent.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Even m ore extrem e than the other two.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
T hey were m ore extreme. One example is that
 
--
 
astory f rom the Nazi 
occupation continuedwe had to leave ourapartm ent.The Hungarian governm ent, and I 

em phasize that the Hungarian governm ent
,  
forced Jewish peopleout of their apartm entand 
forced them  to go to designatedhouses which were m arked with ayello w Star of  David. And 

people, non
-
Jews, had tom ove out of thoseapartments and Jewish m oved in. 
 
 
So we had to leave our apartment.W e were supposedtom ove intooneof  these 
designated houses but m y mom
 
--
 
I just can'tdescribe.She was a sm art cookie. She knew that 
it's nota good idea tom ove where all the Jews are gathered because then they were ver y 

easily identif iable andsent into the ghetto, sent later onto the concentration cam ps. Sothat's 

when we m oved into the apartment of herm om 's childhoodf riend,a devout Catholic couple 

who took their religion seriously and they took us infor a while.
 
 
Unfortunately, and that's part of the Holocaust history in Hungary, that not only the 
governm ent collaborated but there was a very deeply f ast, his
toric, anti
-
Jewish sentiment in 
Hungary so when theGerm ansm oved in with only 600 people, Eichm ann was able to run up 

hundredsof  thousands of  Jews becausethe neighbors were reporting them, where they were 

hiding, where they wer e staying. And so with the
 
helpof  the Hungarian police they were easily 
identif iable.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Infact, something like 450,000 Jews were roundedup anddeported in abouta 
s ix
-
week periodonce occupied.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
T hat's correct. Adolph Eichmannm entioned in his 
memoir
 
that he was 
surprised at how much the Hungarian
s 
cooperated with them and how quickl y they were able 
to send so many Jews to the concentration cam ps.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You shared with m e
 
--
 
I thinkwhat you said was one of  your own personalfirst 
m em ories was of  yourm other being arrestedby the Hungarian police.T ell usaboutthat.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Ye s.  A s I
 
said, they were collaboratorsand
 
bystanders who were not really 
bystanders because they were actively reported on Jews. One of our neighbors in the 

apa
rtm ent building reportedus to the Hungarian
 
police.T he next day t wo policemen cameand 
arrestedm y m om .And that personalm em ory of m inebecausethe Hungarian police at that 

tim ehad the very f ancy uniform  andI rem ember the unif orm very vi vidl y. T hey ca
me, arrested 

m y m om . I didn't know what was happening.T he host couple were really not telling me the 

truth at thattim e.T hey just said thatm om  goes with the gentlemenand she's going to beback 

in no tim e. 
 

 
She came back inno tim e, practically, next day but it wasn't because it was a casual 
thing. She was taken to one of them ost inf am ous Hungarian jails where people
 
--
 
Jews were 
collected before they were sent to the concentration cam ps. My m om, again, was very alert 

7 
 
and she used
 
--
 
there is a Yiddish
 
word which is wisdom  and chutzpah which is being brave 
enough todo things you otherwise wouldn't do. So this combinationof  the two prom ptedher to 
use thepaper she gotfrom  the Hungarian Ministry of  Def ensethat my father disappeared 

during the war activities and she claimed that she was a war wido w. And war widows have all 

kinds of privileges during the war. But Jewish wi ves of people intheForced LaborBattalion 

were not entitledto this privile ge. 
 

 
Som y m om  went to the 
warden
 
and started, I assum e, scream ing.My m om  didn't say 
but knowing her
,  
sheobviously raised her voice and she told them  that she was unlawfully 
arrestedand they aregetting into big trouble. So they tookher to the Commandantof  the jail.
 
My m om  told the story she wasn't sure w
hether the Comm andant of  the jail had pity on her or 
he wanted to have anexcuse to releaseherbuthedid. She cameback butunfortunately the 

rest of the Jewish ladies you saw in the picture didnot. And that's when we had tom ove again 

because we couldn't risk another 
denunci
a
t i on
. 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W heredid you go then?
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
We
 
went f rom  there to a special apartm ent. 
RaoulW allenberg's nam e was 
m entionedearlier. He's my hero.Actually, I can thank himf or surviving the Holocaust. Hewas 

a  S we
dish aristocrat.He came to
 
Hungary in 1944.T he Am ericanW ar Refugee Board sent 
diplomatsf rom  various countries,m ostly neutral countries, to the occupied Europe,Eastern 

Europe, inorder to save asmany Jews as possible.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
This was very late in the war.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Exactly. T his was 1944, already m illions of Jews perishedbutthere were still 
a lot alive.
 
 
RaoulW allenberg came to Budapest with I think
 
$ 50
 
m illio n ,  wh ic h  wa s  a  lot  of  
m oney. He bought up32 or33apartm entbuildings andhe cramm ed asm any Jewish f am ilies 

as possible.W e stayed in a two
-
bedroom  apartm ent, probably four or five f amilies which 
fam iliesby that tim e were mothers, grandm others
 
--
 
or grandparents and children. And we 
were saved because theseapartm ents wereon the international law, protectedf rom the local 

authorities to enter and to arrest people in those buildings. 
 
 
And that's when the story goes back tothe Arrow C ross takeover.W hen they took 
over the governm ent, they couldn't care lessabout international
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
1944.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
C o rrec t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soeven though international law said these were safe houses, the Arrow 
Cross didn't care.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Exactly.W hat they did was they cam e into the houses and startedto round up 
peopl
e.T hey went f rom  apartm ent to apartment.W ehad to lineupand were led out of the 
building. Fortunately f or us

again, there areall kinds of survivor sto ries.W hether it was 
because of bravery or wisdom  or chutzpah, people survi ved. And som etim es it w
a s,  I
 
c a nno t  
explain any other way, D
iv in e  
P
rovidence.
 
 
W e were not takenout of  the buildingf oronereasonand one reason only, because 
oneof  the HungarianNazi gu y, he was 18 years old, he rememberedm e,that we were 

children
 
--
 
while we we re staying in this apartm ent building, we were playing cowboy and 
Indians in the inner court of the apartmentbuilding.W e used sticksand
 
--
 
b roo m st icks t o  
pretend thatthey are rifles, soundedboom , boom, and we shooteach other and we pretended 

we died.W e didn't know there was a war outside. Again, I didn't know. I was only 4 years old. 

Andfor me everything was excitin g.
 
Anyway, oneday this Hungarian Nazi, young m an, gave 

8 
 
his real handgun to us, fortunately hetook out theammunition, but we were so excited we ha
d 
a real handgun.W e continued to play.
 
 
Anyway, this guy, when we were rounded up, rem em beredme andhe told to his 
f riends to leave little Peter andhis mom alone, we'll go to the next apartment. And so they 

went to the next apartm ent.T hey weren't aslucky as we were. Most of  thepeople were t
aken 
outf rom these protected houses not to the ghetto, not to the railway station, 
not  
to be shipped 
to Auschwitz. T hey we re taken to the Danube. That was October, Novem ber,1944.They were 

led to the banks of the Danube.T hey hadto rem ove their clothes and shoes andthey were 

shot.Their bodiesfell into the river, washed awa y. Nobody knew wh at happened to them . 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And becauseof  what you described, you and yourmom  were sparedat that 
point.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Yeah.W e,f ortunately, were able
 
to escape again.T his time we hadno choice 
but we had to move into the Budapest ghetto. The Budapest ghettowas set 
up by the 

Hungarian governm ent, again, to contain all the Jewish populationof Budapest.Again, the 

Jews of  Budapest were lucky in a sense
 
thatthe Germans were sobusy to roundupf irst Jews 
in the countryside, that by the tim e they cam e to Budapest, it was October, Novem ber
, t
he  
Soviet Red Arm y were ordered intothe outskirts of Budapest. People in the Budapest ghetto 

survi ved because theNazis just didn't have enough time.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
They ran outof  tim e.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
C o rrec t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And now what begins, of course, in latefall of 1944 is the siege of Budapest by 
the Russian Arm y. And you're livin g in the ghetto.And that was anextraordinarily brutal siege. 

T ell us what you can about your lif e during thosem onths, several months, in the ghetto.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Yeah. Lif e in the ghetto, it's very hard todescribe. Budapest was already 
bombed by the Allied Forces, not just Sovietsbut American and British planes came during the 

day.W e spentm ostof the tim e in a kindof  tem porary bom b shelters which were the basement 

of  the apartm ent house we stayed.T hat was actually theapartm entof m y grandparents who 

lived in the historical Jewish district. And that's where theBudapestghetto was setup. Sowe 

spent most of the tim e in the basement, dirtf loor, the basem ent of the apartment houses.At 

the tim ethere was nocentral heating. Every apartm ent hada little stove orf urnace,a
n d 

people stored their coal and wood in the basem ent of the apartm entbuilding. T hat's wherewe 

spent most of the tim e. I do rememberm y m om  put blankets on thefloor and we were playi ng 

with m y cousin.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And these were dirtf loors. 
 
>> P e t e r
 
Gorog:
 
Yeah. Food was practically non
-
existent. Food wasrationed already buteven 
then the shops were em pty.
 
Idon't know how m om  got enoughf ood to have enough energy to 
survi ve the nextf ew months but she did. Idoknow that we broke the very strict Jewish dietary 

laws.W e were not supposed to eat anythingm ade outof  pork. 
 
 
My grandm other
 
--
 
this is how people got food. Many buildings were bom bed outby 
this time. So people who survived went f rom apartm ent to apartment in the bombed houses 

and lookedf orfood, whatever remained.
 
My grandm other was very observant Orthodox Jew. 
She found a slab of  bacon
. Shebrought it back and ate it
 
because we needed
 
every energy 
we could get.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You told me potato skins, which were not really used asfood, becam ea really 
im portant staple in that time.
 

9 
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Yeah.W hen I cam e to the UnitedStates, I was surprised by m any things but 
onething was thathere potato skin was a kind of delicacy served inrestaurants. In Hungary 
we used it for f eeding 
pigs. So it was unheard of that som ebody would eat potato skin. But we 

did because that was the only
 
--
 
m y m om found af ew potatoes andshe didn'tpeel it usually. If  
she did, we ate the peel. And at that tim e it was strangebutthat was the way of life.
W
e didn't 
have water practically. Electricity went in andout.W eused actually our Shabbats candles to 

have light. 
 

 
T hat's,again, an interesting story of how Jewi sh life continuedto strive in the ghetto in 
spite of the circum stances. Holidays were celebrated, traditional Jews celebrate every 

Shabbats Friday evening. W e littwo candles. During the Holocaust in the bomb shelter we lit 

only one candle because we had so save theotheronef or giving us light during thenight.
 
Andeven the one candle which was supposed to burn all the way down was sniff ed aftera 

couple of m inutesto save it for next tim e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Andf or our audience,too, to understandthat that was anespecially brutal 
winter as well. So when you say you didn'thave heat, it was bitterly cold.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Yes, that's correct. And again,m y m emory
 
--
 
during the night we went back to 
our apartment.W e stayed there.Theapartment wasn't heated.W edidn'thave coalor wood. 

So the only wa y to keep ourselves warm , thewhole fam ily gathered in one bedand we hada 

b ig
 
--
 
I don't rem em ber theEnglish nam e.T his big blanketf illed with goose
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Like a comforter.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Like a comforter.So we were on that, the wholefam ily under the comforter 
and kept each other warm  during thenight.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And that lasteduntil January of  1945, I think, whenyou were liberated by the 
Russians, where the siege was over.
 
 
In them eantim e,there's, as you said, buildings being bombed out, they are shelling 
and shooting constantly. So your lif e was in danger in every way im aginable.Tell us whatyou 

know about liberation.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Liberationm eant that life returned to norm al. Normal in 1945, January, in 
Budapest, was nofood, no electricity, no water, no heating. Nevertheless our lif e wasn't in 

danger and that'sthe norm alpart.W e were not discrim inated against because we were 

Jewish. Russian troops came in. 
 
 
I remember,again, 4
-
year
-
old littleboy, very excited to see theSoviet tanks, the Nazi 
tanks, with the big
 
red f ive
-
pointed stars anddifferent unif ormf rom  the Germ ans' unif orm.And 
the Russian soldiers were very f riendly, at least tous children.T hey gave us candy, chocolate. 

W ejust rejoiced inhaving this change in our life.
 
 
Later on I learned, actually 
m uch later on, when the Comm unism  collapsed, thatnot 
ever y Russian soldier was nice.W omen were raped andm utilated.So there are two sidesof  

the story. And thereare two sides of how people look backon whathappened in 1945.
 
 
You used the word liberation.People today, on the right side of  the political spectrum , 
revisionists who try to explain away the Holocaust, say it was one occupation replaced by 

another one, which wa s true
 
--
 
not really started 1945 when the Hungarian Comm unist 
governm ent took ove
r 
--
 
Com munist Party took over the government. Nevertheless,af ter the 
war, that's when Europe was occupied by British and Am erican troops and Eastern Europeby 

the Soviets but that did notdim inish thefact that they were the onewho kicked out the Nazis 

andbroughtf reedom  to us Jews.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you were truly liberated at that point.
 

10
 
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Idobelieve it was a liberation.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ith conditions, even though the warf or you is over, it would continue 
until
 
--
 
in Europe until A
pril of  1945. But as you described, conditions were still awf ul with no 
electricity and running water. How did your m other, you know, this am azingl y resilient wom an, 
how did she setouttofeed her sonand try to f inda way back to som e sense of norm alcy? 
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
W ell, there was a trem endous inf lation. At that tim em oney probably was 
worthless. So every tim e you wanted to getfood, you actually bartered. And in Budapest there 

was nothing tobarterfor. So whathappenedwas that people took the rem aining railway li nes 

and wentto the countryside and tooktheir valuables, whatever was l ef t,and 
bartered it f or 

food.
 
 
I remember onetim em y m om  tookm e, becausethere was nobody to take care of me 
while she had to gotoget food, andI rem ember the railway station. Obviously the cars were 

packed with people som uch because everybody wanted to get outfrom  Budapest
.  P eo p l e 
were sitting on the top of the train. It was f unny f or me thatthey were traveling on the top ofthe 

tra in . I'm  su re it wa sn 'tfu n
nyf or them . Andthen we went to the countryside andm y m om  
bartered away ever ythi ng except her wedding ring.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Except her wedding ring.
 
 
Did any of  your otherfam ily, your extendedfam ily m em bers, survi ve? 
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
My mom had eight siblings.Some of them died during the Holocaust.T wo of  
them  cam e tothe United States.T hey were l ucky enough to get American visa, which was at 

thattim e very hard to get.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That was right before the war?
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
R i gh t  b ef o r e t he 
war. T hey cam e tothe United States.
 
 
T he restof m y father's fam ily practically, completefam ily, perished. T wo of  his 
brothers were taken toforced labor camp andthey diedthere. My gra ndparentsonm y father's 

side, they diedbecause they were old, weak. T here was nofood, there was no medical supply 

or m edical attention. They actually survi ved the war butaf ew m onths later they just diedof  

natural circum stances. Becausea comm on cold could kill peopleatthattime when they we re 

so weak. 
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:
 
You wouldendup living under Comm unist ruleform any,m any years af ter 
that. How did your m otherfare during that time all of those years? She tried to get you outright 

af ter the war. I think the doors essentially closed with the Comm unist complete t
akeover of  the 
governm ent.W hat didyour mother do tohelp get herself and
 
--
 
you described her tom e as 
she was m otivated solely by tr yin g to make life betterfor you.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Yeah. Def initely. That was her determ ination during all of those years 
t o 
survi ve no m atter what. She couldn't gobackto her original prof ession because hats was not 

fashionable af ter the war for obvious reasons, especially during theCommunist system . 

Ever ybody had the sam e Comm unist hatsmade inf actories. So she worked as
 
a se am st re ss 
until she retired.T hat's how we had breadonour table.She worked hard intwo shifts, 6:00
 
to  
2:00
 
or 2:00 to 10:00
 
while I was by m yself  inthe apartm ent.
 
 
In 1953, she rem arried. Typical Holocaust survi vor stor y.W idows hoped and hoped 
ag
ainst hopethat theirbeloved husbands would returnone day but itdid not happen. Som e 
people returned because they were taken by the Soviets as POW sand in 1946, 1947they 

were released.And by 1950 it was obvious thatm y f ather would notcom e back. She 
was  

introduced 
tom y stepfather through a m utual f riend who was one of thefew survi vors of  
Auschwitz concentration camp. He had thetattoo in his arm .
 

11
 
 
 
Again, it's very unf ortunate because it was very t ypical of the time and the placethat 
survi vors didn't talk about their experience during the Holocaust.Everything I know I didn't 
learn in kindergarten. Ilearned af ter I came to the United States, interestingly enough, 

because the Holocaust was not mentioned, was not taught in schools. There were no books
. 
T here were no commem orations,nothing. Asif  itnever happened.W eknew there was awar 

but we didn't know the fate of  the600,000 Hungarian Jews who perishedduring the Holocaust 

out of  the 800,000.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You really learned about thataf ter you def ected tothe United States.
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Correct. Because, again, we were kind of brainwashed. 1949, Comm unist 
governm ent tookover the power, the Comm unist Party took over the government. It was not 

m uch differentf rom  the Nazi regim e in Germany where there was only go vernm ent 

propagandathrough governm ent media whic h atthat time was onthe radio andnewspapers. 

So everything you knew about the world was going to schools runby the Communists and 

telling us that Com munism  is the best thing inthe world and Com munism  and capitalism  is 

dying. T here were two or three newspapers but regardless which ones you bought, you got the 

sam e news what the government wanted you to hear.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I wish we had more tim e to hear Peter's story about theevents leading up to 
his defection and com ing over here and all that thatentailed.W e won't be able to do that.
 
W e have time f or a couple of  questions f rom  our audience.W e'll hear, again, f rom  Peter to 

close our program  in a few m inutes. So we'd like you 
to  
stay throughour question andanswer 
period so that we can turn back toPeter in am om ent.
 
 
W ehave m icrophonesin each aisle.Please,we have a hand up over here, please 
wait until you get am icrophone.T ry tom akeyour question asbrief  as you can. I will repeat it 

as best I can so that we all hear it andthen Peter will respond.
 
 
Ye s,  sir?  
 
>>
 
[Question Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The question is, af ter your liberation
 
--
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Iunderstood. Underthe Comm unist system , religion was not the topic
. 
Religion wasn't banned but was ver y, ver y st rongly discouraged. Priests were arrested and 

sent to labor cam psand other kinds of things. So we didnot know much about what our school 

m ates' parentsdidduring the war or before the war.W e just knew their
 
nam es and wherethey 
lived.W e just didn't talk aboutour personal circum stances.
 
 
Interestingly enough, with hindsight, most ofm y f riends inelem entary school, high 
school, were Jewish but I didn't know it because we never talked about that we were Jewi
sh .  
W etalked about everything but religion. 
 
 
So answering your question, the governmenttook care of the knownNazis. They were 
arrestedand them ajor corroborators were actually executed.Butthe little guys, theneighbor 

who reportedus to the police, I don't know wh at happened to them .T hey lived their lif e.
 
 
And interestingly enough, af ter1989 when Comm unism  collapsed,anti
-
S em it is m 
cam e tothe surf ace again inm any f orm s.By that tim epeople showed their real cause andthat 

is af ar right Hungarian 
neo
-
Nazi party in Hungar y and they got 20% of  the vote in the 
Hungarian parliam ent.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you.
 
 
W ehave one over here.
 
>>
 
I wondered, have you had a chance to return to Hungary and if  so what dateand whatwas 
your reaction? 
 

12
 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
: 
Thankyou for that question.Did you have a chance to return to Hungary and 
when did you go backand what was your reaction to it? 
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Yes, I returned thef irst tim e in 1989 whenI becam e an American citizen and I 
was able to goback toHung
a ry.  A t  t h a t t ime  it wa s  s t ill Co m m un is t
 
--
 
it was the last year of 
Comm unism .
 
My reaction was a kind of bitterness. I was suspiciousof  practically ever ybody
: 
W
ere youa Nazi during the Holocaust? Did 
you 
report your neighbors? 
 
 
T here was anevolution throughout the years how I evaluated Hungarians' role in the 
Holocaust. Andm y m ain bitterness wasf irst because Inever had the real Holocaust story that 
I hatedGerman. I never had German car or appliances though they are the best because in 

m y m indGermans were the ones who killedm y f atherand killed six m illion Jews. 
 
La t e r  on,  a s  
I learned the sto
ry and the history and also hav
ing the privi lege to talk to the German 
Am bassador twice, m y bitterness turnedaway f rom Germany, which
 
actually took 
responsibility for their role in the Holocaust, and they are doing anything andeverything except 

they cannotbring back the dead.Butthe Hungarian governm entunfortunately never took 

responsibility andthere is a revisionist history today in Hungary whi ch tried to describe that we 

were victim s, the Hungarians were victim s of  the Nazis as muchas ever ybody else. 

Unfortunately that's not the whole story. 
 

>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you. 
 
 
I think we're at the end of our program. For purposesof  qu
estions. But when Peter 
f inishes,he will rem ain upon the stage here.If you have a questionyou'd like toask, or com e 

up and just shakePeter's hand, say hi, get your picturetaken with him, please absolutely f eel 

f ree to do that.W e welcom e you doing t
hat.
 
 
It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t P e rs on
 
that our First Person gets the last word. So I'm  going to 
turn back to Peter in just am om ent. Bef ore I do,
 
I want tothank allof youforbeing with us, 
rem ind you that we'll have
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program s each W ednesd
ay andThursday through 
m id
-
August.W e hope that you can return either this year or inanother year.
 
 
W hen Peter's done, Joel, ourphotographer, right here, is going to com eup on the 
stage and take a photograph of Peter with yo u as thebackdrop.W e want you to stay put so 

that you'repartof  this photographfor Peter when we're done with the program . 
 
 
Peter? 
 
>> Peter Gorog:
 
Idon't know if  youalready saw the Permanent Exhibitionor you will see or 
just lookat them useum  website, there is a picture as youexit f rom  the cattle car, which is 

displayed on the third floor, the cattle car which took the Jews to Auschwit z. Across the wall 

thereare pictures of people com ing off the train at the Auschwitz
-
Bi rkenau concentration 
cam p. T here is a picture of  two 
young Hungarian boys, a little bitolder than I was atthat tim e, 
in their schoolunif orm , schoolhats. And thepicture was taken
,  
two hours lateror maybe three 
hours later they were dead. They were m arched straightf rom the railwa y station to the gas 

ch a
mbers.Every tim e I see that picture, asa tour guideor other occasion, I just 
a m re m
inded I 
couldhave beenone of  them . I wasn't. Andfor thatI
 
give thanks tom y m om  and the D
ivin e  
Providence.
 
 
Also, Iam rem inded that althoughthe Holocaust was a unique event in history, the 
consequencesand the lessons we can learn is universal. And that'swh y I'm here in the 

m useum  because there are people who denied thatthe Holocausthappened.They m ay 

acknowledge that Jewish peopledied but because
 
--
 
they died be
cause of starvation and a lot 
of  no n
-
Jews diedalso.Andm y responsibility i s still to really rem ind people wha
t th e mo tto  of  
the m useum  is, " n
everagain." W hat you candom atters. If you lookat the brochures, that's 

13
 
 
what really m atters. Everyone in this room , including Bill and m yself , what we do matters. So 
when we see discrim ination, when we see bullyin g, when we see that peopleare judged 

according totheir religion or the color of their skin, we cannot be bystanders.W e have to raise 

our voice and we have to act. Andthat's what I hope youtake away f rom  themuseum  today. 
 
 
T hank youfor com ing.
