my father was a Russian. He w -- he 
was a Russian citizen. He was born in

Q: How would you describe 
the relationships between Ch
ristians and Jews during 
your childhood in 
Vienna
? 
A: It -- there were no problems, it -- n-naturally 
Vienna, Austria
, the whole 
country was about 98 percent Catholic, 
but I didn™t feel any an ti-Semitism 
personally, and I didn™t hear of any other people talk about it. 

Q: Did your parents ever give you advice

 to yourChristian 
neighbors?

Jewish neig hborhood?

naturally, whatever you -- 
wh enever you visited a synagogue wh en -- it was 
Orthodox. So I didn™t know any diffe
rence until I came 
to this country. 
Q: Did you have a favorite ho
liday when you 
were a child? 
A: Surprisingly, it was Christmas. It was alw ays a lot of fun. 
Q: Can you elaborate what you did on Ch ristmas? 

A: Well, we celebrated like everybody el
se. Was just a -- a -- Jews as well as 
Christians celebrated the holiday. Of cour
se, sometime s,  speaking of holidays, not 
really -- I was ra -- going to school I 
was looking fo rward to holidays because I 
didn™t have to go to  school. 

Q: When -- when you said th at Jews and Christians both celebrated Christmas in 
Vienna
, can you explain what that tradition at
 that time and that place was like, 
cause I don™t think it™s like what most peop
le think of today when they talk about 
Christmas.  
A: Well, it was more or less a trad ition. I 
-- I do remember for in
stance that in my 
uncle™s house -- he was a general in the ol
d Austrian army, in the medical corps, 
and I guess he was exposed to the celebr
ation of Christmas throughout his career, 
and he always had a Ch ristmas tree in hi
s home. And we all got together and then 
celebrated the holiday, 
exchanged gifts like an-anybody
 else. And I was -- to me it 
was just normal. Was not something whic
h was unusual for me to look fo rward to.

But of course, as I got older, I unders
tood more about the difference between 
Christianity and -- and Judaism. 
Q: Did your fami ly observe any Jewish holidays? 
A: The only Jewish holidays 
we really observed were the 
Rosh Hashanah 
and me 
-- and 
Yom Kippur. 
And th at was the only time we did go to  the synagogue and 
we -- well, that™s it. 
Q: Did you have any 
religious education?

ar, elementary as well as h igh school, I 
had two hours a week religion -- relig
ion classes, conducted by a rabbi. 
Q: What else do you remember ab
out your early years in school? 
A: There were good days and th ere were 
bad days. In general I enjoyed school. I 
enjoyed the camaraderie, had many friends, a
nd we played different
 sports together 
and we were very active, and got togeth er
 and went to the opera and went to the 
movies, standing in  line, getting in
to the various -- into theaters.

ttend, was it public or private?

Q: Did you experience any an
ti-Semitism when you were 
little, in school, or on the 
playground, or anywhere? 
A: Not really. There was always friends
hip and th ere were no -- no arguments. I 
mean, I personally stayed away from any ar
guments about religion or any of that -- 
or politics. I never joined any -- any group
, any sp ecial group. 
I stayed away from 
it. I do rememb er one time I was in high school and so mebody made a statement 

which I did not care and we got into a fight right in th e classroom, the benches 
were flying and everything else. But th
at was the only time, and I -- I knew if 
anybody made any comments about Jews or 
religion or anything of that sort, I 
fought back, because I was pr
oud to be a Jew and -- and I didn™t hide it either. 
Q: Do you remember the statem
ent that provoked that fight?  
A: I don™t -- I do not remember, b u t I didn™t like it. 
Q: Were most of your friends Jewish? 

A: It was sort of -- I would say about 50 
- 50. And we got what -- got -- got well, I 
mean, we -- we -- we laughed together, we
 played together and there was n-never 

any expression of you are a Jew,
 y ou are a Catholic, whatever. 
Q: When  you were a child, wh at did yo
u think you would want to do when  you 
grew up? 

A: I was always into science, I lik ed th
at. Yeah, and I also 
wound up doing it.

Q: You told  me some of the things th
at you did for fun when  you were a kid, 
movies and opera. What else comes to your
 mind about some of the things you did 
when  you weren't in school wh en you were a child? 
A: I -- I don™t know, I can™t -- can™t
 separate it for some reason. 
Q: As you became a young adult, late teen
s, early 20™s, what was your social life 
like in 
Vienna
? 
A: Well, social life. We always had par
ties at home, and some -- we -- well, do you 
mean social life as in -- within the family or among friends, or -- 
Q: Both, and I was also thinking in term
s of dating an -and -- just the kinds of 
things that young adults do. 
A: All right. We had always a lot of fun 
together as students, and we went out 
mostly to the opera and the different theaters. And we 
also had parties at home, 
mostly at home. We never went out to -- to
 bars or any of that sort. And it was a 
different life then than it™s t
oday, that -- that I know. We
 le -- we -- w e lived a -- a 
clean and healthier life. We also took a 
lot of trips, hiking trips and mountain 
climbing in those -- in my  day -- young days
. Went skiing away fo r a few days or a 
couple of weeks during the wintertime. Yeah
, I -- we played all kinds of sports. I 
was a member of one of the sports clubs, the 
Vienna 
football club. And I was very 
active in tracks -- in -- in track and -- a
nd in soccer, and was active in the junior

9
league and even won couple first prizes in
 the track. So we were always thinking 
about not just having fun but something s
ubstantial, where you accomplish things 
or wh en you enjoyed things 
like the theater or the opera. 
Q: How much education did you get in
 Vienna
? Ho w high or how far did you go 
in your ed ucation? 
A: I finished the 
[indecipherable]
 technical college in 
Vienna
, graduated in  1936. 
Q: And you were qualified to 
do what with that degree? 
A: I was a civil engineer, and that
 qualified me for quite a few ways. 

Q: Did you follow 
the events in 
Germany
 in the early 1930™s? 
A: Not until 
Hitler
 became chancellor in 1933. Then
, especially the Jewish people 
were aware what™s -- things 
-- what -- what™s going on in 
Germany
. Although, 
times really  got bad for the Jews when 
Hitler
 took over 
Austria
. 
Q: We-We™ll get to that in a minute, but 
you™re -- you™re running 
just a little ahead 
of me. So when 
Hitler
 became chancellor -- you said 
that™s when you first really 
became concerned, what were some of 
the thoughts that yo
u had and what -- do 
you remember any of the conversations that
 your Jewish friends had at -- at the 

time that he first became chancellor? 
A: For some reason we never were -- had any conversation about it, or exchanged 
any views. But -- that -- we always 
felt that it won™t happen to us.

Q: Do you reme mb er reading reports of the 
Reichstag
 fire and -- and the 
emergency decrees that came after that?  
A: Yes, I 
[indecipherable]
 excuse me. Yes, I followed 
the -- the news, of course, 
in the newspapers as well as the radio.
 And something -- as a matter of fact, 
speaking of radio, that™s a radio which my
 father and I put togeth er ourselves. And 
was quite a big success.  

Q: What was going on in 
Austria
, specifically with 
Dollfus
. Can you tell me a 
little bit ab out what was going on with th
e politics of the country in those days? 
A: Well, mostly under 
Dollfus
, things were pretty -- pr
etty steady and were no 
problems as far as anti-Semitism is concer
ned. The administration tried to make it 
as -- as easy as possible for the Jewish popul
ation, and they -- they tried not -- tried 
to make the Jewish population feel at 
peace that nothing would happen to them. 

And he did try to protect the Jewish po
pulation especially, and fought the -- the 
Nazis in the city continuously. 
Q: Were you aware in the early 30™s about the existence of 
Dachau
 and about the 
book burnings and about some of t
hose things that were happening in 
Germany
? 
A: Just was aware of it, but nothing else.

Q: What was your reaction wh en you he
ard about the Nazi boycott of Jewish 
busin esses? Did you have any reaction to th
at or was that something th at kind of 
seemed to fit the same pattern? 
A: Not -- not until 
Hitler 
ma rched into 
Austria
. 
Q: Before he came into 
Austria
, though, did you see any 
of the Nazi propaganda 
that was anti-Semitic? 
A: Oh yes, definitely. You 
know, there were lots of political pamphlets, pasted 
information on lampposts and w-walls a
nd prints and all that. It was very 
uncomfortable too, to see it and to read it. 

Q: Can you reme mb er any of the things that
 you saw or that you 
heard at that time? 
A: Well, as a matter of fact, I was inte
rested in collecting 
all these stickers, 
political stickers. And as a matter of 
fact, I brought it with me to the 
United States
 
and I give it to the Holo caust Museum. 
And they -- they, as a matter of fact, 
displayed it on the th ird floor. 
Q: Did you ever listen to
 Hitler
 on the radio? 
A: On th e radio? Yes, yes, many times. 
Q: What was -- what were your reacti
ons wh en you heard 
him on the radio? 
A: I just -- I think -- I think 
he sounded to me like a crazy man, that™s all I can say.

Q: You mentioned before that the Jewish
 community was a li
ttle concerned. Did 
the Jewish community do anything, or was 
there any activity at that time to show 
that the Jewish community was concerne
d ab out wh at was happening right across 
the border in 
Germany
? 
A: They were concerned, but they
 always felt safe in the city.  
Q: What was happening in  your life during the early 30™s? 
A: You -- the early 30™s? Well, th ere was actually no change. As a matter of fact, 
the only experience I may have had a few times when I went to the college, that 
some of the anti-Semitic organizations, stud
ent organizations tried to start a fight. 
Sometimes they were successful, a lot 
of times they weren™t. But I myself, 
personally speaking, always tried to keep
 out of things, just minding my  own 
business. And just, as I said before, I ne
ver joined any political
 organizations. But 
there were a few scraps between the student
s, whether they were Jewish or -- or 
Gentile, but -- but somehow it didn™t affect 
me in s -- in any way. I was upset about 
it, of course, but nothing I would do ab out it. 
Q: You mentioned before that 
Dollfus
 tried to keep things qu
iet, especially for the 
Jewish population, was fighting Nazis in
 the stree ts. H o w much did you know 
about the Nazi attemp
t to seize power in 
Austria
 in ™34? Did you know anything 
about that? 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

13
A: Oh, in -- that was -- we
ll, that was the time when 
Dollfus
 was killed, and -- it 
was murder, as a matter of fact. No, I 
d -- I -- I don™t -- I was not too much 
interested in that. 
Q: When  
Hitler
 started  moving, before he even came to 
Austria
, what were your 
thoughts, if you can rememb
er, w h en he entered the 
Rhin eland
 back in ™36? Do 
you remember when he entered the 
Rhineland
? 
A: Yes, yeah. Well, it was -- it was just a
nother -- another act of his, and we in  
Austria
 just -- we were more or less like a 
neutral country. We were hoping and 
trying to  -- to stay quiet and -- 
Q: Did you have a sense of increasing alar
m, or was it still status quo wh en he -- 
when 
Hitler
 signed with 
Mussolini
, when they signed their 
Berlin-Rome 
access. 
Were you -- were you begi
nning to get concerned, or
 did you still feel safe? 
A: No. No, no. 

Q: Still felt safe. 
A: Yeah. City was still normal. No changes.  
Q: Did you have any knowledge 
of what was happening in the 
United Sta tes
 with 
respect to the Jewish commun
ity and the protest against 
Hitler
? Did any of that 
news ever filter out to 
Vienna
? 
A: No. Was never anything written 
up in papers or otherwise.

Q: Did you follow the 1936
 Olympics? You were a big athlete, I was just 
wondering if you -- if you followed the 
Berlin 
Olympics. 
A: Yes, we did. Yes, yes, we did. I did 
personally listen to the radio, watching the 
radio.  
Q: Any -- any memo ries of the Olympics that stand out in your mind? 

A: Not really, I -- I knew, of course 
about the -- the black people who -- who 
represented 
United States
. There was a lot -- lot of ta
lk about that, and -- and in a 
way we were glad that they won. We
 were -- were very happy about it. 
Q: Were there any newsreels at th
at time sh owing the Olympic events? 
A: No, not -- not -- not that -- I don™t rememb er.  
Q: It™s okay. What was happening in your life right before the 
anschluss
? What 
were you doing? Were you 
working, were you still a st
udent? What was happening 
to you? 
A: Well, that™s a good question, because as
 I graduate the college, I also had to 
have -- had to serve three months in the military. And it™s like 
an -- like we™d call 
here 
ROTC
. And I reported to the -- to an artillery regiment, which was an 
exclusive regiment at that time, an d my
 uncle helped me. And served for three 
months, going in  in January 1938. AndI was out of town on maneuvers, and 
March the 14
th
 we -- there were rumors th
at the Germans may take over 
Austria
,

and Chan cellor chus -- 
Schuschnigg
 at that time said that he does not want to see 
any blood flowing in th e streets of 
Vienna
, or for 
Austria
, or the entire country. 
And he would not issu
e any -- any orders to fight or an ything. Those were the 
initial orders given, and of course we, 
as a military unit, we were prepared. 
Suddenly, over -- it was a weeke
nd, Saturday  to Sunday, wh en the invasion started. 
And of co urse my  commanding officer knew 
that the -- I -- a-as a matter of fact, I 
think I was the only Jew in the whole re
giment. And he imme
diately notified me 
that I could go take the next train back to 
Vienna
 to see my parents. And that he 
would see me again in the barracks back in 
Vienna
, because they were packing up 
and ready to  go back  to 
Vienna
. And that was one sight I will never forget. When I 
arrived at the railroad station in 
Vienna
, I was in uniform, in 
the Austrian uniform, 
military uniform. When I arrived in 
Vienna
, got off, got out on the street, I 
couldn™t believe that I -- I wa
s in -- in a city where I 
not only was born, but raised 
and went to school. It was a comp letely stra
nge atmo sphere. First of all, there were 
people on the streets. Everybody had either
 a flag or an armband, Nazi armband. 
Flags all over the place, which ne
ver occurred during my lifetime in 
Vienna
. And I 
took the streetcar, go home, and 
I noticed of course at -- at 
that time, at th -- at this 
particular mo ment I didn™t know that they 
were all Jews who were down on their 
knees scrubbing the sidewalks. And I just
 couldn™t -- couldn™t believe, couldn™t see

it. And I got home and met my  parents. 
And my father -- that was on a Sunday 
when I arrived, my father went to the o
ffice the next day on Monday, and wh en he 
got -- got there, there were two Gestapo 
men waiting in front of his office. And 
they introduced themse
lves and said that they were 
here to transfer the business 
over to th e German banks. And as a matter
 of fact it was -- I think it was like a 
contract, that he would be safe under thei
r control until September the first of 1938. 
And they  were mo re or less watching ev er
y move he made durin
g that period, and 
in the meantime, my -- my
 mo ther contacted my  fa
mily in the -- in the 
United 
States
 and started procedure, getting an  affi
davit to get me out. At that time w e 
also unfortunately fo und out that as 
far as I™m concerned, I could leave 
Vienna
 
without any problems as a -- soon as I got 
my  visa. But my  parents, unfortunately, 
my  father was under the Ru ssian quota and my  mo ther came under the Polish 
quota. Both of those quotas were -- were 
closed, and they just could not get a visa 
to get to 
United Sta tes
, so naturally -- we had contacts in 
Yugoslavia
 and other 
places and my parents were able to arra
nge -- leave here now to go first to 
Yugoslavia
. But going back to -- to
 myself, on Monday morn
ing I got back to the 
barracks, to my  barracks, and believe me or
 not, I got into my room and I couldn™t 
find any of the -- my  personal belo ngings
. And, as a matter of fact, the whole 
regiment couldn™t find anythi
ng of their own belongings. 
And what we found out is 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

the German -- Germans moved in. As a ma
tter of fact when I arrived in the 
barracks, I saw the Germans drilling on -- on 
-- on the field, just like it was theirs. 
Q: I have to  interrupt you because -- 
A: Sure. 
Q: -- we have to change tape. Just one moment.

Q: This is a continuation of the

Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with
 Norbert Hilsberg. 
This is tape number one, 
side
 B.
 And you were telling me about the ba
rracks, coming back to your barrack s 
and what you fo und there. And 
if you would, please continue. 
A: As I said, when I came back into th
e barracks, I couldn™t find my personal 
belongings and we later fo
und out that the Germans 
just took over and threw 
everything down  into th e cellar of the barra
cks. So we all had to scramb le and find 
our th ings. I eventually  did. I immediat
ely contacted my  commanding officer about 
the situation, that my  parents a-are going 
to get me out as quick
ly as possible. And 
so he said don™t worry ab
out it. Of course, I also explained to my  commanding 
officer that I couldn™t leave 
Vienna
 until I get my mili -- mil 
-- military passport, 
because those are requirements to get the vi
sa. So he said don™t worry about it, I™ll

take care of everything. I was in the Aust
rian uniform for almost two weeks -- over 
two week s, as a matter of fact, which he
lped  me considerably, moving around the 
city without any fear. And so the da
y when  the commanding officer had the 
military passport for me, he called me in
 the office and sa
id, now here™s the 
passport, but I won™t give it to you. I said
, why won™t you give 
it? He said, because 
I want to make sure that you™re gonna 
deposit th -- in the American embassy, 
where it belongs. I said, well then, let -- ta
ke it out, I™m going to th e embassy right 
now. He said, no, I™m going to  call a taxi fo
r you, put you in the taxi and -- and you 
-- you take it. Which I did, and I went 
to the embassy direc
tly from the barracks 
and deposited a passport in the embassy and 
then went home. Of course, after that I 
had to take off my military uniform beca
use I was not in the military any more, I 
was discharged; although I was, up until 1956
, I was considered a reserve officer in 
the Austrian army, wa -- at that time of
 course, in the German army. And as a 
matter of fact, I still have my military pa
ssport with me. And so a -- twice -- we -- 
we lived in a -- an 
apartment building and 
[indecipherable]
 apartment building 
near the American -- well, wi -- Americanembassy as a m -- as a matter of fact, a 
new American embassy after the war is lo
cated within  a block, walking distance 
from where I used to live. And w -- our
 concierge was very cognizant of the 
situation and always informed us when ev
er the Gestapo came by to inquire about

the Jewish residents, t o  notify us that 
they were here. And so  whenever that 
happened, my parents of course were safe 
because my  father had th e contract with 
the Germans to be in his office until Septem
ber the first, but fo
r me, I had to leave 
the city twice. And just went to
 the far -- far suburbs of do --
 Vienna
, and stayed  
there for about a week, then I came back again. Well, fina
lly I received my visa in 
June of 1938 and packed everything up, 
wh-w hat I wanted. And of course I could 
not leave 
Vienna
 with more than 
eight dollars in my pocket to go to 
United States
. 
And of co urse my  father, being in a ba
nk, he arranged prior, long prior, my  -- 
before my  departure, to  have mo
ney picked up in -- in twa -- in 
Paris
 when I 
arrived there from
 Vienna,
 wh ich I did, was very lucky. Of course, everything -- 
before I left 
Vienna
, my  passage was comp letely paid and taken care of from 
France
 to the 
United States
. And of course I was concerned about my  parents, 
what -- what will happen to them, but luck
ily they were -- th
ey got the visa to 
Yugoslavia
. It™s only for about I think six we
eks. And then they traveled to 
Italy
 
and from 
Italy 
they went to 
France
. And in  the meantime, my  uncle who had -- 
who lived in 
Philadelphia
, and he had contacts with
 the State department, and 
arrangements were ma de that my  parent
s take a -- buy a round trip ticket -- of 
course sh -- that™s the only thing they 
could buy, a round trip ticket to the 
West 
Indies, 
a cruise to the 
West Indies
 and arrive in 
Cuba
. And so naturally my 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002

parents bought s-some cruise tickets in 
Paris, 
and they left 
France
 on that cruise 
ship in 1940. And th ey cruised and of 
-- when they arrived in -- in ha -- in 
Santiago de Cuba
, the port, the representative of 
the American embassy in -- in 
Havana
 that greeted them and took them off 
the ship. And my  parents stayed in 
Havana
 for -- until April of 1941, when they 
finally got their visa to enter the 
United States
, they came. So that is my story.  
Q: I -- I have a lot of question to -- 
A: Sure. 
Q: -- to ask you. If your father wa
s able to get money out before the 
anschluss
, 
when  did he already start making plans fo
r you? When  did yo
ur parents already 
start thinking ab out getting you
 and getting th emselves out? 
A: Ma -- my mother was the driving force re
ally, because my father s-said -- I -- I 
had nothing to say anyway . I was a good boy. 
But my -- my father 
just took it easy, 
he said, well, everything will be go -- will 
go back to normal, nothing will happen. 
And -- but my mother was the driving force,
 and she -- she really did a fine job to 
get us all out. As a matter of fact, there™s a 
very interesting -- very  interesting story. 

Se-September -- September first came, and of course -- 
Q: Which year? 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
21
A: 1938. And my father left -- on that da
y, he left for th e railro -- for the railroad 
station. I don™t know what for, he went 
down town on someth
ing else also. And 
luckily, he called home to te
ll my  mother something, an
d my  mo ther said, don™t 
come home any mo re. And the reason was is while my  father was away, a knock 
on th e door, and a couple men standing out in
 front of the door 
an d th en  my  mo th er 
says, can I help you? And they
 said, I would like to -- we would like to talk to Mr. 
Hilsberg. 
So my mother said, well, Mr.
 Hilsberg
 is downto wn  for a -- I don™t 
know what -- well, when is he coming ho
me? S o  my  mo th er say s, well, I real l y  
don™t know how long he™s going to  stay do
wntown. He said, well we -- we™d like 

to talk to him. So my mo
ther replied -- said, well yo
u know th at we are leaving 
today. So he said yes, we know, 
but we still like to talk to Mr. 
Hilsberg
 b e fo re h e  
leave. So that was it an d luckily my father
 called in the meantim
e. My mothersaid, 
don™t come home. I™ll j u st lock the door 
and I™ll leave the key 
with my neighbors 
and say goodbye to everything. I™ll meet 
you at the railroad station. And that™s 
what happened and that™s how they got out. 

Q: But when  did she start making arrangeme
nts? Do you know when she started ? 
A: I don™t remember the date, or when th
ey received the -- the 
visa to -- to leave 
Vienna
 for yu-yugos -- for 
Yugoslavia, 
but I do know that they were well 
prepared shortly after I left
 Vienna
, where their -- their personal belongs were all -

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

22
- already packed, because arrangements we
re made that they would go to  -- to 
United States
 to live there. So we ha -- I had one uncle in -- in 
California
, and so 
everything was sent -- all th
e crates were sent to 
California
. So -- 
Q: I -- I™m still trying to figure out wh
en your dad got the money sent to 
Paris
 for 
you, because he di -- did he do it before the 
anschluss
? 
A: Yes, yes. As a matter -- that was goo
d question, I™m glad that you asked me. 
What happened is when  th
e word came that maybe -- 
that the Germans may wind 
up and enter the -- the -- 
Austria
, that™s when he felt that 
he better transfer some of 
the -- the money, the family mone
y, as a matter of fact, to 
Paris, 
to the bank, which 
is -- was th e main branch there.  
Q: I do have some other questions -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- about what you told me. The -- the bi
ggest question in my  mind is why would 
your parents -- why would anybody take a cr
uise in 1940? The war started in 1939. 
I mu st be missing something. Was it -- di
d people feel it was safe to take a -- a 

cruise? 

A: That was the only chan
ce for them to leave 
Europe
 and they just took the 
chance, and it worked out fine.

Q: Before you were allo
wed to come into the 
United States
, did you have to take 
any tests, any physical
 or mental tests? 
A: No. 
Q: In the time you were still in 
Vienna
, after the 
anschluss
, had you heard ab out 
some of the concentration camp s and di
d you know anybody who was sent there? 
A: I -- I knew a very close school 
friend, his father was sent to 
Da cha u
. And -- but 
I do -- do know that he was released from
 Dachau
 and came home after a few 
weeks.  
Q: You also mentioned that you packed  up
 your things and yo
u left. What did you 
take with you? What of your personal 
items did you take w
ith you besides the 
stamp collection that you 
donated to the mu seum? 
A: Well, just took my  -- my  clothing, and 
th at -- that™s all, just what™s on your 
back. 

Q: You -- did you take 
any photos with you? 
A: No, th at was all p
acked in the crates.  
Q: How did you personally tr
avel, and did you travel w
ith anybody else, or were 
you comp letely alone? 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
24
A: I was all by my self. I do have -- I do ha 
-- ha -- I did have a second cousin in 
Paris
 I stayed with for about a 
couple weeks before I left 
France 
for the 
United 
States
. 
Q: You said you had an uncle in 
Philadelphia 
and an  uncle in 
California
 and the -
- the crates and everything went to 
California
. Was 
California 
your destination 
also? 
A: I assume it was my parent™s destinati
on, but it has changed because they finally 
settled in 
New York
 and ev erything had to  be sent back to 
New York -- 
California. 
Q: But when you came to the 
United States
, what was your destination? Wh ere 
did you think you were
 going to end up? 
A: I stayed with my great-aunt in
 New York
 for a couple weeks and then -- that 
was in the summer, of course, of ™38. And my  uncle from 
Philadelphia
 picked  me 
up and to ok me to his summer home up in 
New Ha mpshire
 and we stayed there all 
summer, an d then went
 back to -- to 
Philadelphia. 
Q: You told  me to ask you about the hurricane of 1938; I did not forget. Can you 

tell me about the hurricane? 
A: That was quite an experience for me
 because I™m -- I was never in my life 
exposed to it, even 
though it was only 24 years of my  life, but I -- I never -- never 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
25
experienced it myself and I 
certainly did. It was a littl
e -- a home right on a lake, 
and that lake became an ocean. As a matter
 of fact, when I came over on the sh ip 
across the ocean to the 
United States
, I went through a storm. And I just 
reme mb ered  th at mo men t  wh en
 that hurricane came over 
New Hampshire
 and 
that little lake became a -- became an ocean. 
And it was really very tough to get out 
because luckily the summer home was not h
it by any trees, but trees were falling 
all over the place. As a matter of fact, th
e next day, my uncle and I, we had to 
move tree trunks in order to get out to
 the main road from the house. So it was 
quite an excitement fo r me. I -- I -- in a 
way I enjoyed it, but yet I felt very sorry 

for all the damage I sa
w in the way home from 
New Hampshire 
to 
Philadelphia
. 
Q: Did you speak any English befo
re you came to this country? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Where did you learn it? 

A: In school, in high school. I took classe
s in French and in 
English, and through 
my  entire high school I had two hour -- two classes a week, wh ich -- an hour in  

English as well as in French. 

Q: What were your expectations of the 
United Sta tes
 when you first came? 
A: I read a lot about the 
United States
 and I had my family, had family in the 
United States
 and they came to visit us many times in 
Vienna
 and stayed with us. 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002

So I had a pretty good idea
 as to what the units -- 
United States
, especially 
New 
York
, looked like. And I was not a bit disappoi
nted or -- or surprised when I saw it 
myself with my own eyes when I arrived in 
New York. 
Q: What about your expectations of
 the American citizens? How did the 
Americans strike you? 
A: I liked them from the 
moment I arrived in the 
States
. I think it -- I was -- I w as 
used to that type of life and excitement and variety of life in the 
United States
, and 
I felt very quickly, almost immediat
ely I felt like it -- being at home. 

Q: Did you realize at that time just ho
w lucky you were to have gotten out? 
A: I certainly was because as a measure f -- 
as a mat -- as a matt
er of fact, when I 
found out recently that I am 
considered a -- a survivor, I -- I just couldn™t believe it, 
because I personally really did not suffe
r, and for that matte
r, my -- my parents 
didn™t suffer. They su ffered a 
little bit more than I did, bu
t at least th ey made it out 
all right and didn™t have these bad experi
ences. And -- and -- and kept on living.  
Q: When you came to the 
United States
, did people ask you about what was going 
on in 
Vienna
 and what was going on in 
Germany
? 
A: Well, they did, but I didn™t have 
much experience except 
my  just personal, 
couple experiences I had du
ring my -- before I left 
Vienna
. But otherwise no, I -- I 
couldn™t -- couldn™t really tell th
em. I -- ab -- of course 
I was able to tell them the 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
27
story what I saw while I was there, how th
ey treated the -- the Jewish people, not 
only that, but the Jewish owners of -- of 
stores and so on. An
d life really changed 
overn ight. 
Q: Now, you had already left 
Austria
 when a lot of histori
cal events happened, so 
I would like to ask you about a few of th
em, and if -- if you were not aware of 
them, that™s fine, but 
let me just ask you. 
A: Oh, okay. 

Q: Had you heard about the 
Evian
 conference? 
A: There was some written in the 
paper, that™s all I -- I k n ow.  
Q: What was your reaction to the agreement between 
Chamberla in
 and 
Hitler
, the 
peace in our time agreement? 
A: Well, that was -- th at was devastating 
really, because I personally didn™t believe 
in it and it sure proved the point. 

Q: How was that event, this peace in
 our time, that agreement between -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: How was that reported in the 
United Sta tes
 newspapers and on the radio? 
A: I really -- I really don™t -- I -- I can™t
 express my self, I -- I -- I -- I -- I really 
don™t -- don™t know, I -- I do know that everybody was upset, and the -- it was not 

believable.  

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

28
Q: How did you learn about the events of 
Kristallnacht
? 
A: Through the newspaper and radio. 
Q: And what were your thoughts wh
en you read abou
t these events? 
A: I really couldn™t believe it, what they 
have done. And just 
sitting here and -- and 
-- and trying to reminisce, it is just unbe
lievable that in the -- in this world things 
like this can be done, ev
en in th ose days, which was 50 some years ago. 
Q: What was the reaction of the Jewish co
mmunity here and the -- just the general 
American public here to the news of 
Kristallnacht
? 
A: I really, really w-were -- was n o t too mu
ch aware of it except
 for just the news. 
I guess I was too young in the group I was 
with. They  just did not pay too mu ch  
attention to it, except of course that 
everybody was upset what has happened. 
Q: At that time were you still in touch with  people in 
Austria
? 
A: No. 

Q: Can you tell me, besides the hurricane
, what did you do those first few weeks 
and months that you were in the 
United States
? 

A: Well, the first -- first two weeks in 
New York
, I had a marvelous time, I had a 
cousin, the young -- young 
girl who took me all over 
New York
, showed me all 
the sights. And one night, as a matter of fact
, she -- she took me to a café, dancing, 
and she co uldn™t believe that I -- I was up 
to it, to the latest dance available, 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

29
because 
Vienna
 was very cosmopolitan and of course, we just did the same thing 
in 
Vienna
 as they did in 
New York,
 or any other place in the 
United States
. As a 
matter of fact, I also concentrated 
on seeing all the American movies in
 Vienna
 
while I was still living there and that -- th
at helped my Eng
lish also, naturally. 
Q: Were you able, or did you need to ge
t any mo re education in th is country? 
A: No. 
Q: All right, you were here by th e time 
Hitler 
annexed part of 
Czec hoslovakia
, 
and did you think th at that event wa
s reported accurately and well in the 
United 
States
? 

A: I really would not know. 
Q: Do you reme mb er hearing ab out the 
Sa int Louis, 
the ship? 
A: No, I didn™t. As a matter of fact, not 
until the -- the -- I thi
nk there -- there was a 
movie about it? Yes. T h at was actually the 
first time that I really knew what was -- 
really what was happening. Truthfully
 speaking, I didn™t read too mu ch 
newspapers in the begi
nning wh en I was here. 
[indecipherable]
 I had other 
interests. 

Q: Is there anything that -- that we have
n™t talked about that  stands out in your 
mind about the period of time be
fore World War II started? 
A: How -- how do you mean? 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
30
Q: For example, did you experience a
ny anti-Semitism when 
you came here? Or 
any an ti-foreign feeling? 
A: Here in the 
United States
? No.  
Q: September 1
st
, 1939, how did you find out
 that war had started? 
A: A friend of mine and it was on a Sunday, 
he went in the afternoon, in the mid-
afternoon to  the movies in 
Philadelphia
. That™s where I lived
. And when  we came 
out, there were extras, on World War wa 
-- World War II broke out. That was -- 
that™s how I found out that the 
war started, the invasion of 
Poland
. 
Q: Did you still have any family left in 
Lemberg? 
A: Where? 
Q: In 
Poland. 
Did you still have any family left in 
Poland
? 
A: No, no, they™re all gone. 
Q: With the news that the war had begun
, how did the American population react, 
and were you su rprised in any 
way by the American reaction? 
A: No. 

Q: And you had no co rres
pondence with anybody in
 Euro pe
 still, at that time? 
A: No.  
Q: How carefully did you fo llow the war news? 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
31
A: Well, not until -- not until 1941 did I r eally follow that. Course, 1941, that™s 
when I entered the services of the 
United States
 Army. 

Q: Did you have any id ea of how the Jews
 were being treated at that -- you know, 
in ™39 and in ™40? Before you got in
to the military, did you have any idea? 

A: Only from what I 
read in the paper. 
Q: In what ways was 
America
 ch anging in ™39 when  
the war started and into 
1940? Did you detect any ch ange
s in the American community? 
A: No. 

Q: Did you notice any alarm 
in the Jewish community? 
A: Oh, I -- I heard, but somehow 
it didn™t affect me too mu ch. 
Q: And what was happening in your life 
in 1939 and 1940? Wh at were you doing 

before you got into the military? 

A: Well, I graduated in 1936, and I got a j
ob in a research organization, and at the 
same time also, I was always participa
ting during my younger years, growing 
years, in -- in choirs, join
ing choirs and singing in  the 
school, and -- and everybody 
in the family, including my  -- my mother, of course, suggested that I have a 

beautiful voice, and I -- I should try to -- to
 learn, to study. And I just -- I™m always 
up for some -- always up -- ready to do so
mething else, something different. And I 
had a -- a interview with one of the finest voice teachers in 
Vienna
 at that time. 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
32
And he said, my  God, I want you to be 
my  student. And he -- I started to take 
singing lessons. And then he transferred me 
to his assistant, a Bulgarian man, and I 
studied voice and ca -- actually contin
ued studying voice when  I came to 
Philadelphia,
 I went to the 
Curtis 
Institute and studied 
voice there. In the 
meantime also, naturally, I want
ed to be independent so my  uncle got me a job in 
Philadelphia. 
Q: What kind of job? 
A: Well, he was -- had connections with the city solicitor of -- of 
Philadelphia,
 
and of -- my first job we came -- we ca
me back from the hurri
cane experience in 
September of -- September 
of 1938, which was the 27
th
 of September 1938, and -- 
and he -- this man got me an interview wi
th a person in the ci -- in city hall who 
had something to do with th
e library. Apparently they ne
eded some translators. So 
I went up there, was -- had an interview 
at nine o™clock in the mo rning and we had 
a very pleasant meeting. And th e last ques
tion he asked me, he said to me, are you 
a citizen of the 
United States
? I said no, but I -- I alrea
dy -- already applied fo r my  
-- for my second papers. I do -- I do have th
em. So he said to me, I don™t care. And 
he pounded his fist on his table and 
said I don™t care if even President 
Roosevelt 
is 
going to ask me to give you a job, I 
will not. That was that. That was my 
experience, my first experience 
trying for a job in -- in the 
United States
. So I 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
33
went back  home and I told my  -- my  uncle 
about it. He says well, let me call Mr.
 
Sharfson
, and he called him. So the guy says
 to him, well, don™t wo rry about it, 
I™ll get him an -- a job. And sure enough, 
two days later I had an interview in the 
Litz
 department store in 
Philadelp hia
 in  the advertising department. And so I -- I -
- I worked there until I went to
 the service in February of 
™41. And thit -- the what I 
did is, since I was mu sically inclined 
and knowledgeab le in a way, I -- the 
department store had, every Sunday mo rni
ng, a two hour classical music -- a -- a 
mu sic hour, two hours. And I was in charge
 to  arrange the program every Sunday 
morning. So that was a nice, interesting job 
fo r me to do. And of course I had to be 
careful, using th e -- the time properly with
 -- with the commercials and so on. And 
on th e side I have oth-other duties like f
iling and doing things in the advertising 
department. So I -- I liked that, I -- I enjoyed it very much, and --

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Norbert Hilsberg
. This is tape number two, 
side
 A. 
And I™m sorry, we were talking about
 your job and th e concerts, the 
Sunday morning concerts and -- and so me 
of your other duties and responsibilities, 
and you were abo -- you were 
going to finish with that 
and about to tell me  about 
going into the military. And I™d also like you 
to tell me if you were drafted, or if 
you volunteered. 
A: Well, so as I -- as I was saying, I 
was proud to make my  ow -- have my  own 
money and do as I pleased. And in the mean
 -- also, I continued taking my  lessons, 
singing lessons at the 
Curtis
 Institute in 
Philadelph ia. 
And then in Octob -- was it 
October or November of 1940, Congress dr
afted th-the bill for conscriptions. And 
at that time when  -- you had to go to th
e draft board  and report, and -- and they  
gave you a number when you -- wh en -- 
the numb -- yeah, the number was a 
number -- if you had a low number that m
eans that you -- they would call you for 
duty in a -- in a short time. An-And unfort
unately, I -- I h ad an -- well f -- actually 
fortunately I had a low number. And it was, of
 course, winter of ™40 - ™41, and in 
those days, of course, you only served fo r 
one year. That -- that™s the time period. 
So I liked having had the ex
perience in the military in 
Austria.
 Of course, I was 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
35
aware that the summertime,
 especially the summertim
e in the Amer -- in the 
American camps, I -- I found 
out were located, most of 
them in -- in the beginning 
of the -- the war, in -- in the south. So -- and I always hated hot weather. So I 
figured well, if I can -- since I have a 
low number, I found out 
when  they™re going 
to call me, which I did and they told me, 
well, your number would indicate that 
you probably will -- will be called  in April or
 May. So I said, April or May? I said 
-- so I asked him, would -- could they take me
 now if I -- if I decide? But of course, 
I have to check with my  boss first. He sa
id well, if you want -- want to volunteer, 
we™ll take you in  right now if 
you want to. Said no, le-let™s
 wait. I went back to my  
job and I talked to th e boss and he said 
fine, go. If you feel -- if you want to go 

now, go ahead and go into 
the service. We™ll keep the 
job for you. When you come 
back, I guarantee you, you will have your 
job back. So with th
at, I felt good about 
it. I went back to the draft board. That 
was ab out -- mu st have been about January 
and I volunteered for a 
year, and February 18
th
 of 1941, I went to
 the service. I was 
taken to Fort
 Dix
 in
 New J e rsey
 and I had my  physical a
nd I had interviews. I had 
the intelligence test an d during  the intelligence test they
 asked me, do 
you have any 
special -- special unit you would like to jo
in? So I said, well I really -- I really 
don™t care. So the -- the interviewer says
, well, you have engineering background 
and you wa -- do -- what-what else di
d he say? Don™t -- don™t rememb er.

Engineering backgr
ound and what was the other one?
 Oh, the military service, of 
course, in the Austrian Army
. So wha-wh at would you lik
e, engineering? I said, I 
really don™t care. I™ll ju st go in and finish 
my year and that™s al
l I™m interested. So 
they sent me to Fort 
Bell
 wa -- which is -- which is an
 engineer camp , and -- and I 
went there and they  put me 
into mapmaking. And of co ur
se, that™s my -- my forte. 
I like geography and of course, in my  e
ngineering ground -- background helped me 
to learn quickly how to make map s. My ma
th and -- and geology is included in -- 
in that. And I -- I started out as a privat
e in 1941, and shortly I became promoted 
and my commanding officer and the execut
ive officer of the battalion which I-I 
was attached to, came over to the drafting 
room every morning for inspection. And 
as I was sitting in my drafting table a
nd so my  commanding officer and my  b -- 
company officer st-stayed th -- I -- I was th
e only table, always stopped, talking to 
me. At the other tables they just passed 
by. He says well, how™s my little refugee 
feel today? You gain ed some mo re weight
. And so came -- was in November, or -- 

or must have been end of November 
or early December, that was December 
seventh. Yeah, it was December seventh, 
of course. Was December seventh, it was 
in a Sunday. A friend of mine, we took o
ff. I got a pass to go into town. We went 
to 
Wash ington
 and the reason was that th-the 
[indecipherable]
 choir gave a 
concert the Constitution Hall at three o™cloc
k in the afternoon. Well, in those days, 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
37
before the war s -- before the 
United States
 was involved in the war, of course, 
they -- they didn™t care too much for th e soldiers. And -- so we went to the 
Constitution Hall and it was all so ld out, no ti
ckets available. Othe
rwise in the -- in 
the later days, after the war started , well 
they gave you free tic
kets and ev erything 
was available for the -- for the u -- 
United States
 soldier. So we wound up in the -- 
went to the Library of Cong
ress to play so me chess. But five o™clock was the time 
for the Library of Congress to close, so 
we returned the che
ss set, an d the guy 
behind th e counter said, okay, good lu ck 
boys, won™t see you any mo re. I said, 
what -- what do you mean, won™t see you a
ny mo re? That was five o™clock in the 
afternoon, December 7
th
, 1941. So  he said, well don™t you know th at 
Pearl Harbor
 
was -- was bombed? 
Pearl Harbor
 was bombed? Wh at? We went out -- well, it 
was really chaos in 
-- in the city of 
Wash ington
. There were army trucks all over, 
picking up all the soldiers 
from th -- on the streets and 
taking them back to the 
camps. Well, we decided we™re not going 
to get caught. We went through side 
streets and though alle
ys and we wound up at 
Basil™s 
delicatessen on 
Pennsylvania
 Av enue and 
E 
Street, and we figured  we™ll have the last good 
Jewish meal. And we came back -- we took
 the bus back to the camp, to Fort 
Belvoir
 and my  God, everybody was packin
g, everybody was ready to go. But 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
38
luckily our outfit was attached
 to general headquarters in 
Washin gton,
 so -- and of 
course we were not involved in  that
. So that™s -- that™s my story.  
Q: After 
Pearl Harb or
, did your duties or responsibilities change? 
A: Well, it was s-secrecy all around, especi
ally in -- in my job because we -- we 
started to be involved in  prep arations 
for -- for war maps and invasion maps and 
that sort of stuff. So natura
lly, secrecy was all around us. 
Q: When  you first joined the militar
y, what was your citizenship status? 
A: I was still waiting for my 
citizenship. As a matter of
 fact, I did not become a 
citizen until April of 1943.  

Q: I™d -- I™d like you to  tell me about so
me of the changes that you saw unfold ing 
in this country right after 
Pearl Ha rbor
. In those first weeks and months after 
Pearl Ha rb or, 
wh at did you see around you, not ju
st in the army , but did you have 
any contact at all with
 any of the civilian centers, lik
e any of the cities or anything? 
A: No, not -- not at all. I do know one thing,
 that we were very busy in doing our 
job, and there was little time left fo r other 
st -- things to do. And we had very little 
conterwi -- of course we -- we wer -- we we
re told to have as
 little contact as -- 
contact as possible with the outside.  
Q: So tell me what you were doing generally
 or specifically in 1942. Were you still 
-- you were Stateside? You™re
 nodding your head, bu -- 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
39
A: Yes, we were -- we were Stateside, a
nd working pretty hard. We -- I myself p u t 
in anywhere from 10 to 12 hours a day to 
prepare all the maps 
necessary for the -- 
for north
 Africa
 especially at that -- at that time.
 And in 1942, wh en things became 
mo re and mo re involved fo r the 
United States
, our general headquarters decided to 
send us overseas to be attached 
to a general headquarters in 
Euro pe.
 And at that 
time also there was -- they started to prep
are fo r the European invasion, and th at 
would be a good location to  do wh at we ha
ve to do. Unfortunately, or fortunately, 
whichever, I was still not a citizen, and 
even though my comma
nding officer did 
his utmo st to take me along, the war de
partment -- at that time war department 
would not allow me to go because it was t
oo dangerous if I were captured as a -- I 
was still, more or less I -- an Austrian, or 
an enemy, anyway. An
d so they kept me 
here and they formed a new cadre for a 
new battalion for mapmaking, because they 
needed more than one,  so of course I wa
s left back in the 
United States
 and we 
formed a new ou-outfit. And -- and we -- 
we put all these newcomers through basic 
training like I used to go th rough, in th
e beginning. And -- and we work ed. We™re 
still attached to general headquarters in th -- 
Washin gton
. And then come 1940 -- 
™43 -- of course I was a citizen in April,
 but in Novemb er of
 1943, our out -- the 
new outfit was sent to north  
Africa
, and that™s where I left for overseas in 
Novemb er of 1943. A
nd I stayed in north 
Africa
 for about a year. We took over a 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
40
little French si -- town
, little ti -- cher -- 
Cherchell
. And we set up shop there and 
did a lot of work  for th
e invasion of southern 
France
 with the seventh army , and 
also worked for General 
Mark Clark
 in -- in
 Italy
. And started preparing, as a 
matter of fact, started preparing to
 work -- make military maps of 
Austria
. And of 
course, I was in charge, naturally. But we 
did not finish it because we were asked 
to be sent back to 
United States
 and back to  the 
Pacific
, and we went to 
Ha waii
. 
We attached to 
Pacific
 Ocean headquarters and starte
d to wo rk on all the invasion 
maps of the islands and 
Japan
 and so on. And as a matter of fact, on -- on 
V -- 
not 
so 
V --
 no. Yeah, 
V-J
 day, that™s when the -- when 
Japan 
finally gave up. On  
V-J
 
day the war didn™t end for our outfit, becau
se it just so happened th at we work ed 
on 
Tokyo
 bay and General mar -- 
MacA rthur
 would not move in with the 
Missouri
 into the bay, unless he has all the in
formation available to him. He just 
didn™t trust these guys, naturally. And so 
we -- for us the war wasn™t over until two 
weeks after
 V-J 
day. And we finally were finished
 and that was in ™45. And I was 
dischar -- discharged in  Novemb er of 1945
. And when my wife 
picked me up from 
Fort
 Mead
, she told me that ther
e was a letter from the war department waiting for 
me. And of course, I -- at that point I di
d not have any idea wh
at I™m going to do. 
And I -- I would not go back to  
Philadelphia
 because my  wife is a Washingtonian  

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
41
and she has all her family and friends here
 and so I decided we™re going to raise a 
family here, in 
Washington
 area. 
Q: I want to stop you before
 you go any fu rther because I have several questions. I 
don™t even know where to st
art. What was your final ra
nk at the end of the war? 
A: What? 
Q: Your rank. 

A: The rank? Master sergeant.  
Q: While you were still working on maps of 
Euro pe
, whether you were in the 
United States
 or in north 
Africa
, did you have any idea of
 wh at was happening to 
the Jews inside the 
Reich? 
A: Just what I heard on -- on radio broadc
asts, that™s all w e had at that time. 
Q: So you had no maps or no inte
lligence on the camps themselves? 
A: Not on the camps, no. We knew -- we 
knew that there were camps, but we 
didn™t know more about it.  

Q: Were there any reports, either 
in the regular newspapers or in 
ﬁStars and 
Stripesﬂ 
about what was going on wh
ile you were already in 
Ha wa ii
? 
A: Yes, yes, we knew that, yes. 

Q: What -- what do you recall about reading 
ﬁStars and Stripesﬂ
 for example, and 
do you rememb er reading about the liber
ations of some of these camp s? 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
42
A: Yes. But that™s -- that™s just ab out a
ll the -- they were just short reports, there 
were no details.  
Q: You also mentioned a wife. Now, you 
have to back  up and tell me when you 
met your wife and wh en you got married, 
because you kind of forgot that part. 
A: It was -- I believe -- I think it was in 
April of 1942. I -- friend of mine and I, we 
had the early evening off, and we went to
 the movies in a ge -- in a -- in Fort
 
Belvoir.
 And th -- we were at the early show
 and the sh ow was over, I think it was 
nine o™clock in the even ing and my  friend,
 he always went to these dances. They 
brought in girls from the Jewish community  center or from other organizations to 

dance with  the boys, entertain them. And 
on that particular day there was some  
Jewish org -- something of -- I think 
it was from the Jewish
 community center, 
were sent to Fort
 Belvoir
. And my friend says to me, le
t™s go. I -- I want to go. He 
usually went to these affairs, I didn™t.
 And so he said, come on, don™t be a 
spoilsport. I said okay, I™ll do you a favor. 
So we walked into 
the hall where were -
- they were dancing and a buddy of mine was work ing the record play er. So he saw 

me and he called me u p  on the stage and 
said, come on, let me dance while you -- 
if you want to work. I said, sure, sure, I™ll 
ta -- I™ll take over, I™ll play the records. 
And for the rest of the even
ing, was almost until about 10
 o™clock or so, I played 
records. And the dancing -- and I -- I just
 looked and en joyed watching the people. 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
43
And -- and all of a sudden -- it was the last
 dance, all of a sudden I see a girl 
coming by the stage right -- right below me
 and sh -she had a do -- red -- red dress 
on, or was it a jacket or something, but sh
e just hit my eye. So I said, I want to 
dance with  her, and I ju mp ed off the stag
e. And I asked for the dance and that -- 
whoever 
[indeciphera ble]
 passed it on, and we were dancing. And I said -- I said 
to her, my first words -- wo
rds were, where have you be
en all evening? So one 
word  led to another and as a matter of fa
ct I -- I was supposed  to, since I was in 
charge, I was supposed to bring th e record
s back -- back to th
e barracks. So of 
course, was late at night and -- and the reco rds were heavy. So 
it just so happened 
that my wife-to-be had a car with all the 
girls in there. So I said, do you mind to  
drop me off with the -- thos
e records? So she said, I r
eally don™t have any room. I 
really have full of -- they had, you know, 
she had ab out a half a dozen  girls in th -- 
in the car. So, in those days they  had th
e standing boards on the cars, on the old 
cars. So she said, if you want to, you can stand on a -- on a -- on a boar -- on a 
body board, or whatever they called it and 
I™ll take you back to the barracks. So -- 
so she took me back to the barracks and be
fore I -- I left, I said, can I have your 
phone number? So she says, I™m
 in the phone book. Just like that. And that™s the -- 
that™s the beginning of the story a
nd here we are almo st 60 years later. 
Q: And your wife™s name? 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

A: 
Maxine
. 
Q: Let™s go back to the wa
r years. What memories do yo
u have of hearing of the 
death of 
Roosevelt
 and also the death of
 Hitler
? 
A: I was sitting in a 
[indecipherable]
 of -- in the 
Schofield 
barracks in 
Hawaii
, 
writing a letter to my wife. It 
was 11 o™clock in the mo rning, 
Ha wa ii
 sty -- 
Hawaiian time and the news just came over the radio about 
Roosevelt™s 
death. And 
I ex-expressed my -- my sorrow 
and then how I felt in the le
tter to my wife at that 
time. Don™t remember any more of the deta
ils of what I wrote. But that was my 
first moment when 
I found out about 
Roosevelt
. 
Q: When  did you hear that 
Hitler
 had died? When  
Hitler
 died. Do you rememb er 
hearing about it? 
A: Yes, I heard about it, but everybody
 was al -- naturally very  happy, and 
celebrated.  

Q: Where were you on 
V-E 
day when -- when the war in 
Europe 
was over? 
A: 
V-E

45
Q: At the time of -- of 
V-E 
day, did you have any idea at that time again, any idea 
as to the extent of the genocide? 
A: I had the inclination because I believe 
I -- my wife did give me some -- some 
information about it 
in the papers.  
Q: Did you experience any anti-Semiti
sm while you were in the military? 
A: No. 
Q: Is there anything else that stan ds ou
t in your mind about the war years that we 
haven™t discussed, that you™d like to talk
 about now, before we go to the postw ar? 
A: No, nothing really. Nothing I -- 
which was special or anything, no. 
Q: Okay . After you were discharged fro
m the service, what did you do next? 
A: Well this I -- this I mentioned before
, I -- when  I got home and I opened up the 
letter from the war department, th ey offe
red me a professional position in th e war 
department, continuing what I have done
 during my army service as a civilian. 
Q: Was there ever a time, any time in 
your life up until then, where you thought 
possibly of going to  
Palestine? 
A: Not really.  

Q: I want to talk about some of the ev
ents that happened after World War II that 
were related to the Holo
caust. Did you follow the 
Nuremberg
 trials?  
A: I -- I followed it, just reading the pape
rs, not -- not too much into detail, no.  

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

46
Q: Did you feel justice was done? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did you follow the 
U.N.
 debates on the partition of 
Palestine
? Was that 
something th at was of interest to you? 

A: No. 

Q: Did you have any reaction to
 the birth of the state of 
Israel
 in 1948? 
A: Yes. Yes, I was very happy that the 
Jewish people have to -- have their own 
place and live their life, hopefully in peace.
 But th-things turn
ed out differently, 
unfortunately. 

Q: Did you follow the 
Eichmann
 trial in the 
early 1960™s? 
A: Just what was written in 
the paper, just pure curiosity. 
Q: During all of these even
ts, did you get a sense of 
how the American population 
was reacting to the 
Nuremberg
 trials and the partition of 
Palestine?
 Do you have 
any memo ries along those lines? 
A: No, not really. 
Q: You stayed in the 
military after the war. 
A: No. 
Q: Oh, you sta -- in a related 
field, with the mapmaking -- 
A: Yes.

47
Q: Excuse me, I™m sorry. You were in 
Washington
 during th e Ko rean war and the 
war in 
Vietnam
. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Do you have any though
ts about those events in American history? Any -- do 
you have any reaction or an
y thoughts about those even ts. Well, how did you feel 
about the wars at the time? 
A: Well, of course I was involved in -- 
in working on these areas and doing my  
best to -- to help the Amer
ican soldier. Other -- otherwis
e no, I -- I don™t have any 
other reaction. 

Q: As a Jewish refugee, what was your 
reaction to the Civil Rights movement in 
this country? 

A: Well, I was very interested naturally, 
and I felt that it was about time that we 
forget the -- the fights among black and wh
ite or whatev er color is involved. And 
after all, I p ersonally feel that we a
ll equal and deserve the same treatment 
regardless of color or 
religion or whatever.  
Q: The 60™s were a very turbulent time in
 this country . Do yo
u have any thoughts 
about some of the events of the 60™s
, whether it was Civil Rights, or th e 
Kennedy
 
assassination or even  th e sexual revolution. An-A nything strike you as, you know, 

did anything strike home with you,
 based on your life experiences? 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

48
A: The only thing which disturbed me
, and the -- what -- what -- which I 
personally feel caused the -- the 60™s to 
turn out the way they
 did is the drug 
revolution. I -- I personally believe that if
 not for the drugs, things would have 
been more normal than
 what they turned
 out then, and unfo
rtunately continue 
today. 
Q: I™d like you to tell me about your pr
ofessional career over the years. Wa -- 

about your professional career. 
A: Are you speaking of while I was worki
ng for the Department of Defense? Well, 
I continued to -- doing what I was doing in  
the service. Of course we were very 
busy regardless, whether there was no war, 
or -- or peace. We had our problem 
with the
 Sov i et Unio n
 and with -- with the Eastern Bloc.

Interview with Norbert Hilsberg  
 
August 12, 2002 
 

 
 
49
A: Well, it™s -- ma -- in  my profession the 
war still continued as a civilian, and we 
were just as busy as we were during the 
war years, working lo ng hours. We have 
all these problems like th
e Cuban crisis and the
 Bay of Pigs.
 And I was always 
involved in those activities. And kept us 
busy, it was very interesting work, very 
challenging work , tiring at times. And of 
co urse with the revoluti -- revolution of 
the computers, things became easier to 
handle, but yet, they were even more 
complicated than before. I 
personally was very pleased with -- with my  life during 
that period. I feel that I accomplished a lo
t and I was also re-rewarded with nice 
reports. And -- and I continued climbing in 
the echelon of my 
office, and finally 
wound up as a -- in a staff 
position in the headquarters as
 a production 
e-engineer, 
and had additional responsibilities, was 
not involved in doing it myself but 
directing other people ho
w to do it and wh at to do. And th at™s about it. 
Q: You have children? 

A: Yes, I have two daughters, four gra
nddaughters and two gr
eat-granddaughters.  
Q: What have you to ld your
 family about your childho
od and your experiences in 
Vienna
? 
A: Actually very little. We -- just late
ly my family has got more and more 
interested in my life and experiences, espe
cially since I was asked to give this 
interview, they™re very an -- very 
anxious to listen to the results. 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

50
Q: Has your view of religion, of 
Judaism changed since your days in 
Vienna
? Are 
you mo re religious, less religious? Has anything changed? 
A: I™m more conscious of being a Jew, 
and -- although I still don™t belong to any 
temple or synagogue. But I -- I do think more
 about it and I -- I feel a lot closer to 
my people. I feel it™s in  -- in my age it™
s a little bit too late, but I do my best.  
Q: Are you involved with
 any Holocaust related 
groups or institutions? 
A: Well, I™m a member of the Holocaust 
Museum ever since it was established, 
even before -- before
 they started to build the mu
seum itself. And I contributed 
some of my  collections and I also 
contribute every year, as a member. 
Q: Do you or your wi
fe do any work with 
the Holocaust Museum? 
A: No. 

Q: Have you gone back  to 
Vien na
 in the years since the war?  
A: Yeah, I went back three 
times. The first visit back si
nce I left was in 1971 and 
believe me or not, we did not feel -- my  
wife and I, we didn™t feel too comfortable 
there. They -- they seemed 
to feel that th -- we™re Je
wish. They  did not go out of 
their way to help us or talk to us, give us
 service and so on. But I also must sa y that 

I left in ™38 and I came back in ™71, th at the city itself has not changed a bit. 
Everything is the same. The 
streetcars are numbered, they  go in  the same places 
I™m used to, the buses, nothing has change
d. And I was glad to see that, although 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

51
the people were a little bit sour. I don™
t know why. Just because I was there, 
maybe, I don™t know. But anyway, the 
second visit we had is wh en my  
granddaughter spent her college semester in -- in 
Florence
, and we all visited then. 
And that was really a -- the best time I™v
e had with my  children and grandchildren, 
when  we went to 
Vienna
. We met them -- we visited the first -- well, we went to o 
-- 
Vienna
 first and then my  daughter and he
r husband and their three daughters 
joined us in 
Vienna
 when they came up from 
Florence
. And we spen t eight days 
in 
Vienna
 and I took them thro
ugh the whole city, and I took them to the 
elementary school where I used to go to
. But -- this is th
e nice thing about 
Vienna
 
is -- compared to the 
United States
, they™d rather destr
oy and build new in the 
United States
, but in 
Vienna
 they -- they™re trying to -- 
to keep it the way it is and 
maintain it proper
ly. But anyway, 
[indecipherable]
 elementary school and my 
youngest granddaughter was a -- I think ab
out seven or eight years old, and of 
course she just enjoyed it. I took her to 
the classroom where I was sitting for my -- 
my  sec -- my  second grade. And as a matter 
of fact it was a Saturday afternoon. Of 
course, school are still there Saturday -- Satu
rd ay morn ing, half d -- half day school 
on Saturday, so we just arrived there wh
en the children left, and I was waiting until 
they are all out, and then I wa
lked in with 
my family and took th
em into the school 
build ing. And in  the classroom, one of the 
classroom the teacher was still there and

says, I told her, but she just couldn't belie
ve it. She couldn™t believe it. And I took 
her to the apartment where we used to liv e and of course that was a really high 
mo men t  in  my  life, b e cau se
 I -- I noticed the children 
in my family were so 
interested in seeing where I grew up. An
d -- and the third time was in 1990. We 
took a talk tour to ma -- eastern 
Europe
 and we wound up in  
Vienna
 for the third 
time. And as a matter o f fact, I did visit 
Auschwitz
 when I was in 
Poland
 and it 
was devastating really, even now. And I was in 
Kraków
 and I was in 
[indecipherable]
 
Buda pest 
and then I would up in 
Vienna
. And in those -- as a 
matter of fact, I didn™t mention 
that in the second visit to 
Vienna
 with my family, I 
-- that was in -- in ninet -- in 1990 and th
at was a complete tu
rnaround as far as 
being a visitor there. People seemed to be 
very polite, very help
ful, very pleasant 
and it was almost like being 
in any other city in the 
United States
, really. But if 
course, in the back of -- of
 our head there was still -- 
still the past, naturally. And 
bif -- the third time, ju st a few years ago,
 and it was the same. I enjoyed it while I 
was there for about three days. And that™s it. 

Q: I had asked you before, 
and I™ll -- I™ll ask you th is again, maybe I can get a -- a 
different perspective. During the war yo
u didn™t realize the full impact of the 
genocide. When  did you realize just what
 you had escaped, what you -- you know, 
by leaving when  you did? When  did you 
get the full impact of the genocide?

A: Unfortunately, I lo
st all my family in 
Poland
. Had family in 
Warsaw
, had 
family in 
Lódz, 
I had family in 
Kraków
, I had family in 
Belgra de, 
and they  were 
all gone. I tried to -- as a matter of fact, i -- bef-before -- and let™s see, it was -- 
mu st have been in th e 50™s, yes, it was in
 the 50™s, my father -- I don™t rememb er 
how he fo und out that the cousin
 of mine from the family in 
Wa rsaw
 survived. 
And he is in -- he was in 
Paris
, he lived in
 Paris 
and my  father got in touch with 
him and tried to bring him over to the 
States
. He was married at that time alread y. 
And -- but in turn his wife found out that 
her father survived -- I don™t -- I think it 
was 
Auschwitz
, and lived in 
Tel Aviv
. So  naturally they decided that they™re going 
to 
Tel Aviv
 rather than come to the 
United States
. And so at least found out that 
one survivor. Then, a second 
survivor I found out is -- 
I -- I -- I -- throughout the 
years, since that time, up un
til the -- this mo ment, I tried 
to find out what happened 
to them, and I got in touch 
with the international Red 
Cross. And through them I 
found out that my uncle, w
ho lived -- they lived in 
Ló dz,
 he died in the ghetto, 
Lódz
 ghetto. Bu t my  aunt and their son wo und up in 
Auschwitz, 
and of course, 
unfortunately my -- my -- my aunt -- my a
unt, she just didn™t su
rvive the camp in 
Auschwitz
. But my cousin, who was then in hi
s late teens, they sent him to 
Dach au
. And I found out through the Red 
Cross that he was liberated in 
Da cha u
 
and they  gave me all the information av a
ilable, but they could not find out for me

what happened after he was 
liberated. And I™m still trying to -- to locate and find 
out what happened to  him, but no lu ck so far. 
Q: Did any of your 
childhood friends from
 Vienna
 survive? 
A: I have a dear friend, we grew up toge
ther in high school and th rough our late -- 
latter years. He came to philadel -- 
Philadelphia
 too, shortly after I arrived there. 
And once in awhile he -- he goes -- he went back to
 Vienna
 more often. Now, he 
was half Jewish and he was half Catholic
. So  he had the easier rap -- rapport with 
the people -- with our school friends, and 
he saw some of them and -- and he found 
out that some died during the war, were 
killed during the war and other survived 
and they  just make a bare living, whic
h I don™t really care about the ones wh o 
survived, truthfully, as far 
as I™m concerned,even thou
gh I didn't have any bad 
experiences during our time in school, they
 were -- they were fine. It™s very 
possible that they -- they felt bad about it, t
oo, but after all, they
 had to surv ive, and 
they had to do whatev
er they had to do. I do have 
one experience myself. The first 
-- first visit in 
Vienna
, I noticed that a school friend of mine in high school, he was 
the -- the son of one of the big 
precision instrument stores in 
Vienna
. And when  he 
came back, his -- the -- his -- his father™s
 store was located nearby where I lived, 
where I grew up, so we came by and I notic
ed the name -- same name still on there, 
so I figured mu st be the son who is in bus
iness. And so just of
 curiosity I walked

in. He was a Gentile. And I walked in and I w -- I recognized him immediately , 
and he was busy with a customer so I 
stood on the side waiting until he was 
finished. No sooner the customer walk
ed out, he turns 
around, he says, 
Norb ert
, 
where have you been ? Where have you been
; that -- that hit me
. He should have 
known. Bu t anyway, well he welcomed me and -- back , and let™s get together. And 

I said, I™m sorry, I -- it™s my
 last day and I wanted to show my wife some other 
things. So that -- that -- that was 
my  personal experience going back to 
Vien na
. 
Q: Did any of your Jewish
 school friends survive? 
A: I really -- I hope th ey di
d, but I have no -- no contact. 

Q: When  you lo ok back
 on your life in the 
United Sta tes
, what would you say has 
been your biggest disappointment in the 
United States
, or wh at has been your best 
surprise about life in 
America
, or both. 
A: We have no disappointment really. An
d it™s accentuated what I always thought 
about the 
United Sta tes,
 because my original 
plans is -- of course,
 Hitler
 helped 
me -- my original plans 
was to -- to go to the 
United States
 and live there anyway. 
So I just -- just assimilated immed iately,
 just like I -- I al
ways lived in the 
United 
States
. 
Q: September of -- of last year, S e
ptember 11 -- nine-1 1, given your life 
experience, how did you see that 
event and how do you see life in 
America
 today? 

 
Interview with Norbert Hilsberg

A: Well, Americans unfortunately, that™s 
one thing I -- oh, an yway, I was going to 
say, Americans forget too easily, and I fe
el that we are -- little by little we -- w e 
forget about September 11
th
, 2001. And I was very, very  disturbed about wh at 
happened that day, and I just -- I still ca
n™t believe that we have people in this 
world who -- who do such thin
gs in a civilized society. 
I -- as far as I™m concerned 
they™re the scum of the earth 
Q: One or two more questions. Is there a
nything that we haven™t talked ab out that 
you would like to add? I mean, you didn™t 
tell me mu ch about your parents after 
they came here. Would you like to talk about
 your parents a little bit and how they 
managed here? 
A: All right. My parents settled in 
Manhattan
. My father tried to get into -- back 
into the banking business, but he was not 
very successful at that time, I don™t know 
why, but at that time I guess, they just sa
id they didn™t hire anybody and maybe -- 
maybe his English was not too good, I have
 no idea, or the -- they both spoke 
pretty well. So -- but he was always a ve
ry handy man. He made furniture and I 
built radios with him. And so he found 
himself a position in a -- during the war, he 
found himself a position in a naval ordinance factory in 
Brooklyn. 
And he work ed 
himself up to an inspector. An
d he worked hard. He had to
 get up early to get the 
subway to 
Brooklyn
, and came home and he was tired
. But he made a nice living.

And of co urse my  mo ther started to give
 piano lessons and sh e was very successful 
in that, throughout the years. 
Q: Did you ever sing professionally after the war? 
A: No. I -- I do remember 
during our stay in north
 Africa
, in that little town of
 
Cherchell --
 no, no, I™m sorry, not to 
Cherchell
, it was 
Affrevielle
. During the -- 
we -- we became very friendly there, mostly 
Jewish -- Jewish fam
ilies living in that 
little town who escaped from the mainland.
 And we have quite -- we had a few 
Jewish fellows in our outfit and we beca
me friendly with these people. They -- 
they invited us 
for Friday night
 Shabba s
 and Saturd ay and we
nt to the synagogue, 
and -- but we also helped th
e people, the local people ce
lebrate Easter. And so one 
of my  close buddies, he played the piano,
 so he played  the organ in the church , 
they didn't have any orga
nist there. And I sang the 
Ave Maria
. And well, we made 
the local people very  happy, and I enjoyed that. 
Q: And you are retired now? 
A: Now, yes, yeah. 
Q: Yes. Wh-What™s still in store for you?
 What yet would you like to accomplish? 
A: Well, first of all, celebrate my 80
th
 -- 88
th
 birthday and secondly and mo st 
important, cel-celebrate my 60
th
 anniversary, which is on
ly a few -- couple -- two 
or three weeks away from now. And hopefu
lly, hopefully I -- I w

great-grandchildren grow up. Maybe I™ll see th
em in school yet. I -- I hope so. I do 
my best. They -- they keep me
 alive, they keep me going.
