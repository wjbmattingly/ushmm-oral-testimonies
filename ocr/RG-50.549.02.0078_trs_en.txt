Interview with Lucie Rosenberg 
April 16, 2004 
 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Question: This is the United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby 
Herr collection. This is an interview w
ith Lucie Rosenberg, 
conducted by Neenah 
Ellis on April 16
th
, 2004, in Washington, 
D.C.. This interview is part of the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum™s pos
t Holocaust interview project, and it™s a 
follow up interview to a USHMM videot
aped interview condu
cted with Lucie 
Rosenberg within the 
last five years. 
Answer: Yes.  
Q: Not sure of the date. The United States
 Holocaust Memo rial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making th
is interview possible. This is tape 
number one, side A. When 
your video interview ended, 
you summarized a little bit 
about what happened 
to you after your family came to
 New York. But I™d like to go 
back and talk a little bit more 
specifically about some of th e things that happened to 
you and your parents and -- 
wh en you first arrived ther
e. And y-you mentioned in 
the -- in your interview that your father 
went into the mu stard business in Brooklyn. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And tell me a little more about th
at, how did that come about?

A: Well, he and two other people, one, a 
man from Belgrade who was actually an 
electrical engineer, and a man by the name
 of Rolf, who was a Polish refugee, 
decided th at they had to do something an
d this was apparently available. At one 
time my father had a -- wa-was in someth
ing -- I won™t say -- s-say [indecipherable] 
but in the alcohol business -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- and in a vineg -- he had a vinegar fa
ctory in Liubljana. So, he had some notion 
of -- of this -- of a very little. And so they
 were there, I think my father -- I™m not 
quite sure what year 
my father sold it out, but it was 
very traumatic for him, I must 
say. And particularly negotiations 
with the union was quite funny. 
Q: So these three men pooled their 
money and bought an existing business? 
A: They bought an ex isting business, yes. 

Q: What did they call the mustard? 

A: They actually made mustard for vari
ous well-known mustard firms, I -- I -- I 

can™t tell you -- I mean, there were various brands and so on. The thing was called 
Old Du tch mu stard comp any. And as I said
, they -- they -- th
-they -- I guess they 
got the labels and the -- and the -- the 
-- the -- what would you call them, the 
containers and so on and th ey did it fo
r various comp anies that I don™t rememb er 
the name of, but they  were certainly better known than  the Old Du tch mu stard, 

right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
4
Q: Mm-hm. And they did that
 for roughly how many years? 
A: Sic -- I™m trying to think. Maybe five
, maybe s-six, and -- I mean, my father 
bailed out very soon afterward, he couldn™t 
stand it. He couldn™t stand it, he also 
couldn™t stand driving to  Broo
klyn daily, and so it was -- 
Q: Did he go into another business after that? 

A: No, I think he mostly invested in real
 estate and by that time we had already 

gotten -- he -- he™d started working on -- 
on this project of getting -- getting the 
comp ensation from the Yugoslav 
government and so on, so -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- no. 

Q: Can you explain that a litt
le bit, the compensation? 
A: Yes. The royal Yugoslav government 
had deposited in the United States a 
serious sum -- I mean a serious amount of go
ld, I guess it mu st have been ingots, or 
whatever you called gold. And after awh
ile the Tito govern
ment wanted to -- 
wanted to  get this gold back to Yugosla
via and Un ited States said yes, after you 
have compensated United States busin esses 
that were there pre-war, and s-some of 
our -- an-and our citizens, American 
citizens whose -- whose property was 
nationalized . And, as they had nationa
lized a number of things, numb er of 
build ings, numb er of factories and so on
 [indecipherable] Yugoslavia after the war. 
We -- we were within this particular grou
p of people. And this
 went on fo r several 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
5
years and finally -- finally a lump sum came
, and then I guess mo
stly he -- he -- he 
traveled a great deal, he -- actually he di
d the trip around the world with some 
friends, and -- 

Q: And you were in this gr
oup of people because of th
e busin esses that he had? 
A: Also my -- no -- 

Q: No? 

A: -- no. Simply because, for instance my
 -- my -- my mother™s house, which is 
right in the center of Zagreb, supposedly
 very historic, it was built by her great-
grandfather. In fact, this was built -- when
 this house was being built, Jews were 
still not allowed to have
 property, real estate property
 in Zagreb. But by the time it 
was finished -- so it star -- it was b u ilt unde
r the name of the architect, was a very 
famous architect by the name of Felbinger. 
And by the time it had been -- so this 
was known for years it was a Felbinge
r house. But by the time the house was 
comp leted, this law had been  passed in 
Au stria-Hungary  an-and they could, you 
know -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- own the property. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So this was extremely valuable property
 because it™s in the very center of the 
main square in Zagreb, and there™s a great 
deal of -- of -- of -- I mean, this is a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
6
small, this is a two story,
 very old pa -- I mean, hous
e. But the back is very 
valuable, let™s say like some
thing on Times Square, it -- ju
st the main square in 
town and so -- 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: -- just the land itself is extremely valu
ab le and there was another house in the 
back and so -- so that was one
 of the things and also my
 father had -- had some -- 
ano -- some more real estate property in
 Zagreb and other od
ds and ends, and -- 
Q: So he got invo
lved in this comp
ensation negotiation? 
A: Yes, ye -- well, not really. I mean, yes, 
he -- he did, I mean, he and a lawy er and 
so on, it took a great deal 
of time and cu  -- and he had 
to travel to Washington a 
great deal and so  on. Bu t this was done 
thro ugh a lawy er here who -- who -- whose 
name I don™t re-recall right now, but was an
 American lawyer who dealt with this 
and with numerous oth -- not too many, but 
other people who had arrived about the 
same time we did, an d some
 a little earlier. Not many who arrived later, because 
first of all there was this cut-up -- cut off 
date and secondly we arrived just -- we 
crossed the border from --from A u stria to 
Switzerland on the day that the -- the -- 
the -- Belgrade was bombed, 
so you know, if we had be
en caught we would have 
been obviously in bad shape. 

Q: An-A nd was your father successful in that? Did he get his money? 
A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
7
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It was serious mo ney at the time. I don™t -- I -- I don™t rememb er what -- what 
the amount was, but it was a lot of money.  

Q: Mm-hm. And when -- when you were fi
rst in New York, you mentioned that you 
were doing some translating and so
me research at the library -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- when you met someone who was aff
iliated with broadcasting. It was the 
precursor to the VOA. But can you talk a little bit about your 
life when you first 
came as a young person and -- and who were
 your friends and 
wh at did you do and 

-- and were you happy to be there, were
 you -- you know, what -- what were your 
prospects? What did you -- 
A: Yes -- yes -- yes, I was very happy to be
 there because -- in a way, of course I 
was sad, because as so on as we started 
getting news of what was going on, it was 
very painful. But -- but there was a lo
t of hope still going on. There was a 
government in exile which was [indecipher
able] that was in -- 
in -- in London and 
then came back into 
the United States. We th -- both 
my  brother and I thought this 
was really fun. We arrived in New York  an
d we stayed in a -- in a -- a what do you 
call it, an apartment hotel
, it was da -- it was on 57
th
 and Sixth. It was called The 
Salisbury, it was like two or th
ree rooms and a little kitchen in a closet, and a -- and 
of course, you know, they cleaned up an
d gave you th e -- and gave you fresh 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
8
laundry and so on and there were pa -- I 
think there were two bedrooms and some 
kind of a living room and so on. And I re
me mb er going to a five and 10 cents store 
and we bought all of this crazy china, very
 cheap stuff, and like f
our plates and four 
spoons and so on. And it was sort of lik
e playacting almost. Nobody was aware of 
really what was going on and how it was going
 to happen. There was -- we knew, of 
course, that there were Jews being take
n to concentration ca
mps in Austria and 
Germany, but there was no talk of death cam
ps, and there were none at that time, I 
don™t believe. And so, we were there. Also
, at the same time, this gentleman who 
was in the mustard business with my fa ther, who was from Belgrade, he -- they 
came -- no, they may have arrived just a 
little earlier than we did. There was a girl 
who was about, I don™t know, two, three ye  -- two years younger than I am, and a 
boy who was maybe a year or two younge
r than my  brother. And it was fun. My  
mo ther didn™t have the faintest notion abou
t cooking. This very nice Mrs. Shanser 
taught her to cook. By that time w e had 
moved to a nice furnished place in river -- 
in Riverdale in New York. 
Do  you know where that is, 
across from [indecipherable] 
Q: No, I -- mm-hm. 
A: -- but anyhow, it™s -- it™s almo st on the border of Scarsdale and well, 

Westchester county, or what
ever. And they had this ve
ry nice apartment building 
that had a bus taking you to the -- to the 
subway if you wanted it, several times a 
day, and to the little grocery, to -- to
 shopping [indecipher
able] was where my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
9
mother used to go with
 this friend who was teach
ing her how to cook. And 
however, wh en we got there, we discovere
d that there really -- we didn™t have 
enough knives and fo rks and we
 couldn™t fu nction very  well with wh atever we had, 
these four spoons and so  on. And that place 
did not have any tabl
ecloth or any -- it -
- it -- it -- it was the -- it -- actually , the 
furniture was quite nice, and it was large 
and quite pleasant. So then my
 father went to an aucti
on in New York . And th is was 
a extremely  sad thing that I™m still -- that is
 still terribly 
painful to me. He went to 
the New Yo rk docks, wi -- where there we
re numerous cra -- not crates, what you 
call the -- what do you call these things th
at you send large amounts of furniture, 
household goods? 

Q: Containers? 
A: Contains. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Okay. And for non-payment 
of fees at the dock, these 
things were auctioned off. 
So he didn™t really know wh at -- what was 
in it, but they  would say, I don™t know, 
china and silverware and odds
 and ends and so on. And he
 bought this almost sight 
unseen -- in fact, sight unseen stuff, which 
then was brought home and I still have 
it, but this -- now it™s going to go [indeciph
erable]. Very, very elaborate -- if you 
want I™ll show you the thing because it™
s kind of amusing -- china, wh ich was 
obviously bought by a family 
that was moving to the St
ates with you know, what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
10
can we buy that -- that -- of German goods that I -- we™re permitted to take out and 
so on. 
Q: Mm. 

A: So this is just a lot of 
gold and a lot -- I™ll 
show it to you -- thi
ng, which we used 
for everyday use. I think we were cutting 
things and so  on. I mean, our -- our china 
at home was very nice china, but it wasn™t 
elaborate, I mean was -- it was okay, it 
was -- 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- it was a -- we -- we thought this wa
s really fun, both my  brother and I. And 
then one day -- there™s all so
rts of stories about it -- one day somebody said, do you 
know how much this st
uff is worth? I said, absolutely no idea, I 
mean, this is what -
- yeah, this is what we use. Although we 
thought it was quite funny that it was as -- 
as -- as elaborate as it was. So finally we
 decided okay , we need to  do -- put this 
aside. However, later on we did use forslightly better stuff, slightly better 

occasions, this china. And one day -- by 
th at time the government in exile had -- 
from Yugoslavia, had left London or some pa
rts of it and were in London -- were in 

New Yo rk. And as ours was really 
just about th e only family -- 
Q: Intact. 
A: -- intact, and you know, we didn™t live in
 a -- in a hotel, all of these guys whose 
wives were left either in Zagreb or in 
Belgrade and wh atever, would congregate and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
11
come and have coffee with us and -- and 
kugelhupf and things like that. And by -- I 
don™t know, this wasn™t at the time, ye
t maybe it was, that Albina Padovan had 
come from -- no, I™d -- I™m -- I don™t th
ink so. Anyhow, we were having, I 
reme mb er as today, there were about five 
or six various ministers of one kind or 
another. One of them was the mi nister of 
-- of the post office, who was a -- w ho -- 
who -- who had gone to the -- to a -- to a 
Franciscan seminary, 
but who became the 
minister of, as I said, of the post -- of po
st offices in th -- and was a friend, very 
close friend of my father™s from childhood 
days. So he was there, and then  there 

was a guy by th e name of Gavrilovic who wa
s a -- who was the Minister of Finance. 
He hadn™t a been, but I™m -- I think he 
was pre-war, pre -- pre-war, I think he was 
the -- a congressman in Belg
rade. That was Gavrilovic.
 And there were several 
others. And then there were some people
, some refugees who had meanwhile come 
from Belgrade and -- via Cuba, which was 
another way that people were coming in. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: And they  got into -- and I had -- 
this was at the tim
e when there was a 
particularly horrible story goi
ng on with Draža Mihailovi
 and -- and -- and -- and -
- and Tito. And it was at the time wh
en the Germans were killing every 10
th
 child or 
every 10
th
 male in one of the cities. And I 
remember co ming b
ack from work and 
they™re s-standing th ere and suddenly they  got into a horrible fight. One was with a 

cake knife and the other had his -- had the -- 
a chair, trying to ward off -- I -- I don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
12
reme mb er who  was do ing  wh at
. One of them fainted, and my  mother and I ju st 
disappeared  into th e maid™s room and lock
ed ourselves up because we didn™t want 
to be part of this whole story. And in th
e process one -- one of the cups got broken. 
So it™s not an absolute -- 
Q: Perfect set. 
A: -- [indecipherable] set. So -- so, you know,
 we mu st have been
 -- this wasn™t an 
unusual thing, they  were there a lot of 
the time and so that necklace, one of the 
things. And then when we opened this -- this
 case with the set -- 
with -- with -- they 
had between it, and I may s
till have some, little flannel 
dividers with embroidery, 
hand embroidery  around it. 

Q: Wow. 
A: You know, it -- it w as just -- 
Q: Heartbreaking. 

A: -- heartbreaking. It was awful. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: But I don™t even think -- this became h eartbreaking later to me
, th-this -- this was 
still all in the process, okay -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- so you know, maybe they™re somewhere 
else. We didn™t know yet what really 
was going on.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
13
Q: Yeah, and did -- these men were 
coming -- you knew what was going on, 
because you were in touch with these peop
le whose lives and livelihoods were very 
tied up with wh at was happening there. 
A: Sure. 
Q: So you were on th e edge of -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- knowledge. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Was it the assumption at that moment 
in time that y ou were
 gonna go back ? Was 
this a temp orary situation for you? 
A: It was a temporary situation. 
Q: Yeah? 
A: It was so much a temporary situati on that I actually th
ought when I was -- 
married Morris, that he was going back 
on his job and I was going with him. And 
then he had to resign and [indecipherable] 
Q: Well, you™re jump
ing ahead a little bit. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So your -- your -- your moth er and fath
er were assuming that we will maybe stay 
here -- 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
14
Q: -- til things blew over and -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- maybe -- maybe a fe -- years, but -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- we™re going to go back. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. Tell me about your
 job, this job th at you got. 
A: The job was the -- the organization at
 that time was called coordinator of 
information, and Elmer Davis was the head
, the director and whatev er you would 
call it. 
Q: Right. 
A: And at that time I g u ess there was so
me broadcasting going on, but I had very 
little to do with it. What I did was, I wa
s in something called the media analysis 
section and with me it mostly 
consisted of sitting in thepublic library in New York 
doing research on the number of speakers 
of [indecipherable] or -- or -- or -- or 
Serbian or whatever. But I 
remember mostly it was African and -- and -- and -- and 
Asian languages. I wasn 't te rribly good at 
it, but anyhow I did do it. And then this 
mo -- merfed -- morphed, is 
the word, morphed into a -- in
to the -- first it was called 
-- this was only called va -- as I said, coor
dinator -- coordinator of information and 
then it became -- it wasn™t still Voice of Amer
ica, forget what it was called. It w as -

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
15
- that was an in betw een thing. My husba
nd was in the same building and I didn™t 
know him at all.  
Q: And this was in New York? 

A: This was in New York, yeah. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: There wa -- there -- there was broa
dcasting going on mo s
tly from London, and 
there was a man who was a Serb who had 
lived -- a Yugoslav, but he was a Serb, 

who had lived in Paris and ha
d been doing broadcasting in
 a very interesting way. 
We always listened to him in Zagreb, pro-
allies and so on. And as the French -- he 
finally got evacuated and left -- and 
ended up in New Yo
rk  and continued 
broadcasting from -- not Vo ice of America,
 b u t what was the pla -- I™m trying to 
think of what it was called, it wasn™t -- it 
was - it was not yet Voice of America, it 
was coordinator of in formation.
 Office of War Information -- 

Q: Uh-huh, of course, right. 

A: -- was what it was called, yeah, okay. So
 within the Office of War Information, 
then we got Voice of America. Morris was 
in a totally different
 thing and I didn™t 
even know he -- he existed. So this Se
rbian broadcaster ended up in New Yo rk. 
Q: Was this Petrovich? 
A: Yes, it was Peter Petrovi
ch. Ho w did you know th at? 
Q: From your other interview. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
16
A: Aha. 
Q: You me -- you mentioned his name, yeah. 
A: Okay. So s -- Peter Petrovich, who was qu
ite -- I mean, he was very royalist and 
so on, but at that time there was nothing else. I mean, they a -- we just had started 
hearing slowly that there were two move
ments going on in  Yu goslavia. So anyhow, 
I at -- I was -- my  job was translating -- 
I think he -- I don™t know whether it was a 
15 minute broadcast or longer, half hour, 
it seemed endless, I™ll tell you that. I was 

given -- he would -- he would provide a script
. And I had to translate that script and 
this all went into broadcast c
ontrol or whatev er it was called. 
Q: From Croatian to English? 

A: From Serbian to English, right. 
Q: He didn™t speak English, or 
he didn™t -- he would read it -- 
A: First of all he didn™t speak English,
 but certainly he w
ouldn™t have bothered 
translating. I mean he was -- he was some
thing of a -- of a st
ar. And he probably 
would have been bad an yhow. I was -- I 
was employed there, okay, what are we 

going to  let her do? At that time I thin
k I was working for something called the 
Balkan section that was being run by a -- fi
rst by an  Albanian, and then by a Greek, 
there were no Yugoslavs in left or right, ex
cept for me. And I translate at -- at the -- 
get this material and -- and in -- I would 
get it maybe the night before, I™m not quite 
sure. Come in in the morning, I would tran s -- I would read it and then I™d translate 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
17
it and I would -- this was then submitted and 
then he would do hi
s thing. So one day 
he got very sick, he got pneumonia, but they
 didn™t want to st
op the broadcasts and 
he didn™t want to stop th e broadcasts. And 
he wrote the fine scripts and I translated 
them and I voiced th em, saying that I was doi
ng this, you know, in the name of, and 
it always ended with  long live his highne
ss, kin -- King Peter of
 Yugoslavia, along 
with the -- Draža Mihailovi
, I mean, that whole event. So -- 
Q: I™m going to see how we™re doing. 
Okay, we have a couple more minutes. 
A: So this -- this -- this wa
s it. So then finally a sec
tion, a Serbo-Croatian section 
was se-set up and a very ni
ce person by the name of Milan Hatzuk, who was a -- 
originally  from Zagreb, but who had wo rked  
as a journalist in Belgrade for awhile. 
And I don™t know when  he came to the St
ates, I think befo re we did -- who was 
there and got the job. He was not an Amer
ican citizen yet, but almost. All of us 
were, you know, sort of -- nobody knew what
 was going to go, we were we -- so me 
of us were -- of course, I mean, I -- I wa
s about to beco me an American citizen, I 
had, you know, first papers and the works -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- and so on, so I had very little proble
ms, but we had to be supervised by an 
American and that was it. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And there were -- yeah, ye
ah, which I thought was fine. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
18
Q: Yeah. Was it -- w-was it fun work ? Did 
i -- did you really -- did you like it?  
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you feel a sense of -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- importance in -- in it? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. Then they
 had a women™s program finally. 
Q: Really? 

A: Which was kind of fun, wh ich I th 
-- which I actually heard from friends who 
had heard th at I was [indeciph
erable]. I always felt that
 it was pretty stupid stuff 
because -- because, you know, people really
 did expose themselves. They could 
have been killed for listening.
 This -- this was -- this wa
s a very funny thing. This 
was done -- some of them I did, but they
 weren™t very interesting. I mean, some 
suggestions they had, fairly boring. [indecipherable] I used supposedly for interest 

for women. It was very hard to find an
y -- whoever was at that time I think was a 
secretary of -- of labor, a woman in the States [indecipherable] 
Q: Perkins. 
A: Perkins. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
19
A: And a numb er of things of th at kind
. You know, you tried to do something th at 
wasn™t really just stupid, and did it. And 
this was -- this was beamed to BBC. And 
then BBC several hours later would -- would beam it -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- to Yugoslavia. And as I said I hear
d from friends who had heard me and so on, 
although I didn™t go by my name. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And -- 
Q: What name did you use? 
A: Sorell.  

Q: Right. 
A: S-o-r-e-l-l. So then -- which is
 the name that my brother then -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- [indecipherable] And this was kind of
 fun. It was am-amu sing because I would 
come to me  -- I would come home and then
 I would tu rn on th e BBC, I could hear 
my self several hours later, but at that ti 
-- you know, and then we had these things 
of -- of -- of dictation sp
eed because of sunspots. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: You couldn™t broadcast -- 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
20
A: -- at a normal speed. 
Q: Very slow, yeah. 
A: [indecipherable] very slowly
 and th en there were things 
that had to be in -- there 
were some things that were worthwhile
. You would -- you would broadcast, you 
would hear, for instance, wh
en th ere was some kind of important action back , or 
whatever.  

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And you would have reference to it so th
at they would know 
that one knows here 
that this is going on [i
ndecipherab le] business. 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m. L et me
 turn this tape over. 
A: Sure. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: So the na -- the nature of these broadc
asts that you were doing, ev en though they 
were women™s programs -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- you would somehow weave into them war news? 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Because you weren't allowed to direc
tly broadcast war news? Can you explain 
that situation, or what -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
21
A: Not really, because I -- I think it was mo
stly intimations of -- you would say the 
-- the brave fighters in such and such a place, 
that so on, so on, one is aware of it, or 
something like that. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Th-There were intima -- there 
wa -- there was no direct stuff. 
Q: Mm-hm.  

A: So finally tha -- I mean, this was part
 of the stuff that I was doing. Meanwhile 
there was a very nice Yugoslav
 desk that was set up that had a Slovene, a -- the -- 
the head of the desk, who 
was this very nice guy from Bel -- originally from 

Zagreb, but then later in -- who was a jour
nalist in Belgrade, his name was Hatzuk. 
And then  there was a very old lady and sh
e seemed even much 
older than that. She 
was the mo ther of a very famous ballerina
 here, by the name of Pasha Mira. And -- 
a Yugoslav, bu -- good, I mean, w ell-known. 
And she had been  the wife of what 

originally  was the [speaks foreign language 
here] which would be the director of the 

main Zagreb theater -- well [indecipherable]
 let™s say th-the equivalent of the 
director of -- of the Kenne
dy Center, because everythi
ng took place there, drama 
and co medy and -- and everything. So , very 
old lady, who had been  in the States for 
awhile, and she was supposed 
to be translatin g and she wa
s not very good. And then 
we did fu ture stories of unbelievable bored
om to me. And then other things and y-

you used to have -- of cour
se you -- you had a headline 
thing, and then you had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
22
feature and then you had anot
her feature and so on. So fo
r awhile I was -- I was the 
announcer of, you know, I wa
s the in-between person, y
ou know, you have ju  -- you 
have heard Voice of America, huh?  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Okay, that kind of business. And -- and 
I was translating. I was doing a little bit 
of writing and I was doing a lot of transla
ting because whatever we did -- this was 
on ditto paper, have you ever 
seen ditto paper? It was ab
 -- obnoxious stuff that was 
blue, here. And you would type on that and 
then this was taken to some kind of a 
machine and that was -- 

Q: Oh right, yes. 

A: Yeah.  
Q: Mm-hm. Copy paper. 
A: And all my  pants and ev erything th at
 I wore was blue. Underw ear, everything 
was -- you couldn™t get -- nails. Terrible. Th
en a very nice woman -- okay, excuse 
me. [tape break] What can I tell you? [indec
ipherable] Okay , so then a very nice 
woman by the name of Mary Vucedic came 
in . Mary Vucedic ha
d been working for 
whom I had met in Zagreb, who was a few 
years older than me -- not quite a few 
years older than me, who died recently in
 New Yo rk, who was married to a Croat, 
who worked as [indeciphera
ble] a Croat aristocrat
, Lemaniti Vucedic, who 
[indecipherable] her to the n
th 
degree and finally she got 
divorced. And then we -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
23
you know, we went through all of these te
rrib le things. Her father was killed in a -- 
in Rome in one of the pris
ons in Rome, in [indecipherab
le] was that big -- can you 
imagine giving that name to
 a -- to -- to a prison? Okay
. So that™s where he was 
killed. He™s an older gentleman. Her mo
ther survived and I don™t know how, she 
was a very unpleasant and very demanding 
German Jewish person
. Then there was -
- finally we got somebody by 
-- by the name of Robert Ro senberg, who had been in 
the U.S. Army. How he got there, from Tus
ili in Bosn ia, he ended up in the United 
States Army and was -- I think he got TB 
or whatever, he was demobilized. And he 
appeared in our midst and we were told, 
this is a veteran, you give him a job 
whatever he does. And I will not say that 
he was -- he was illiterate, but he wasn™t 
very good either. He was no intellectua
l. And he -- but, he spoke ab solutely 
classical, beautiful Croatian, wh ich he spoke [indecipherable] 
Q: Yeah. 

A: All of those nice places in Bosnia, I mean
, gorgeous. And all of us sort of had -- 
Zagreb  does not have a very nice dialec
t. And although you s
poke standard Serbo-
Croatian, it comes through, you can tell wher
e people are from. Then there was a th 
-- this -- our boss spoke Serbian, although 
he wasn™t a Serb, but he had lived in 
Belgrade for many times. Then there was 
a Slovene wh o had his own broadcast and 
he tried to keep as far away fro
m us as he could, and -- and -- 
Q: S-So me things never change. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
24
A: Some things never change
. And -- but he -- he was okay. But as I said, wa -- then 
there was somebody, a middle aged Croat, he 
seemed very old to me at that time, by 
the name of Gospodin Katosic. And he la
ter became the head of the desk because 
Herzog decided to jo in Ency clopedia Britann
ica films, and did th
at. Which was very 
smart. And this went on for awhile, and al
ways the same stuff a
nd so on. Very -- not 
interesting at all, but very hard. And th en
 later there were various young men that 
took me out. One, you know -- and I™m just
 thinking of what 
-- there was somebody 
by th e name of Duncan  McDougal junior 
from the -- from way 
up in the mountains 
of No rth Carolina, whose a great, great -- 
actually, he was th -- 
my first boss when -
- in the me dia analysis section. And he kn
ew a great deal about jazz, so he would 
take me to the village [indecipherable] and 
all of these nice things and taught me a 
lot of stuff like that. And I™m just thin
king now, two o™clock in th e mo rning he 
would put me -- and I never 
thought anything about it, 
nor did my  parents, on the 
subway in New York, I would 
go all the way to almost the Bronx there, and then I 
would take a shuttle bus to the house and 
it would be three o™clock in the morning 
when I came to work, and i -- nobody ev en th ought that this might not be very 
good.  

Q: Mm. Mm. 
A: That™s how safe New York was. 
Q: Yeah. Hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
25
A: And then  I had a very wo nderful fri
end there whose husband -- whose second 
husband ma -- later became the P o lish ambassador to the United States, and he was 
in the U.N. with a very high job, and 
he was am-amb assador in  London and so  on. 
And she and I would walk th
rough Central Park West at
 11 o™clock at -- I me an, 
through Central Park at the -- in the mi
ddle of the night, from 47 -- I mean from -- 
what was the address on Broa
dway and a -- and -- and 57
th
 Street to her place, she 
was somewhere near, I don™t know, 72
nd
 Street and who knows wh ere on th e West 
Side. 
Q: Is that where the OWI offices were? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: 57
th
 and Broadway . 
A: Right. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Right. 

Q: And you met your husband th ere? 
A: Yes, in a strange way. He had come
 on leave and he came to tell us he was 
working for -- well, it wasn™t e -- it wasn™t 
Voice of America, and wasn™t -- well, i-it 
was OWI in a way, but it -- they were attach
ed to OSS, I believe, and so  they were 
in uniform, these guys. And he -- 

Q: OSS, a precursor to CIA. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
26
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: They were doing Inte
lligence work in the -- 
A: Yeah. I don™t think he wa -- at least 
he never told me, maybe he was. I™m not 
asking.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Anyhow, and he -- 
Q: Don™t ask him, don™t -- 
A: No, no. And he came to tell us how
 w -- how our broadcast works -- were -- 
were -- were deemed by the Serbs, by 
the lo cals one way or another, what we 
should do one way or anothe
r and so on. By that time 
I was engaged to somebody 
very funny by th e name of Ra
ven McDavid, junior, whose father at the time was the 
-- what was he -- was -- he was -- he wasn™t
 the govern or of South Carolina, but the 
first one under, what was the name  of it?  
Q: Lieutenant governor? 
A: Yeah, Lieutenant governo
r. And I had gone there to 
visit and -- and I was taken 
to [indecipherable] to meet the govern
or and so on, I was very embarrassed 
[indecipherable] was terrible. Anyhow
, I was enga -- I was -- I was -- 
Q: You were engaged. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
27
A: I was engaged. I had gone there with 
my uncle, officially, to Greenville, South 
Carolina and so on and I didn™t even [indeci
pherable] the assemble
d guests at this -- 
it wasn™t a banquet, it was serious dinner 
with the na -- with
 the guys ex-nanny 
serving with white gloves s
till, around, and then after th
e dinner he drove her home 
to her place. It was a v ery strange thing.
 He was a very good scholar, he was an 
excellent scholar and he married somebody
 at the Univ ersity of Chicago and I™m 
sure this was mu ch better than anything 
he could have had with me. Plus, my  
mother couldn™t stand him. Okay, and an
yhow I was -- I  was going to marry this 
guy, and then, you know, Mo
rris turned up and we -- we were both thinking we 
were going to go back  togeth er to Belgra
de, he knew a bunch of
 people, you know, 
he kept me ntioning, that I had known  there. 
And told  us what we did right, what we 
did wrong and then  we star
ted going out and we thought
 we were going back, and 
then of co urse it was impossible. I couldn
™t and he -- he quit because I couldn™t go 
back and then he started wo rking -- or no 
-- or -- or -- or trying to find jobs in 
various other places. B u t he was there -- he 
-- he had gone to Bari, that™s where he 
was mostly -- no, that™s where he-he was in 
Bar -- fi-first he was in Algiers. He had 
flown to Algiers and then th
ey bought up th ese various 
broadcast stations and did 
leaflets and stuff [indecipherable]. And G
od, when you think how
 young they were. 
Q: What year did you get married? 

A: 1946, I believe it is. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
28
Q: ™46. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And -- and what -- wha-what did he settle
 on? What work did 
he finally take up? 
A: He couldn™t find a job. It was very, ve
ry difficult to find a 
job. He was told by 
several people to change his name. This 
was a very difficult time fo r -- there was a 
lot of social discrimination. We had one 
of the most awful things that he kept 

blaming himself and [indecipherable] just aw
ful. About a year or so, I mean a y ear 
and a half, my mother was still in mourni
ng and so  [indecipherabl
e] had been sick 
and friends of ours, non-Je
ws had told us why don™t 
you go t -- so and so  in 
Tennessee, there was a very nice countr
y hotel in the -- and 
by that time I was 
married already -- go up there. 
Q: In mourning for your brother? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Then we got there and when  we signed in
 they said they di
dn™t have any room. 
And I -- we had to restrain Morris, he wa
nted to go and, you 
know, strangle this 
poor pe -- person at the desk. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But we didn™t, and fina
lly, you know we left.  
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
29
A: But that was that and th
en you know, there were -- th
ere were -- there were ads 
in the papers for -- that weren™t o-o -- I m
ean, they were obvious
 to who wanted  to 
know, people that -- we at first didn't unders
tand what this was about and if it -- it 
would say, I don™t know, apartment for rent, 
so and so , close to Protestant church or 
close to such and such a place, or close 
-- you know, th at kind of stuff. And so me 
were more obvious, you know, Christians only, or whatever.  
Q: Even in New York? 

A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah . Bu
t I -- you know, it wasn™t very
 hard  to find a place in 
New York where -- wher
e it was okay to live. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And -- but this is something I had ne
ver, never, never in my  life experienced, 
ever, ever -- 

Q: I know, it™s so amazing, actually. 

A: -- ever. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: It was so interesting to me in your last interview -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- Joan asked you time and time again -- 
A: Never. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
30
Q: -- had you felt discrimination. 
A: Never. 
Q: It™s so interesting. 

A: Never. This was completely
 integrated, school, social life, whatever you want. 
There was always -- the odd thing, the only 
person that I had ever heard of anything 

happening like that was a cousin of ma -- 
not a cousin, a second co usin of mine, we 
-- you know, I guess one heard there were 
things going on, po
ssibly because this 
was such an old family, totally integrated, bo
th on my mother™s a
nd my father™s side 
and -- and maybe I don™t like the -- the -- th
e word , you know, it™s none -- the word  
is not important, but the powerful. I hate 
to say it but these were people who could 
probably  -- no-nobody would have da
red to do it directly to me. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Maybe that™s the reason. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: I -- I -- I don™t know, I -- I -- b u t it wasn
™t, I mean I h ave other friends and -- and 
th-these are people, non-Jewish friends 
whom I™ve had from th
e word from when I 
was three years old, and never occu rred to 
th em, to me, to anybody th at anything 
might be different. That -- also I h ad been
 to -- and -- and my parents also, so it™s 
not my  generation. 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
31
A: So this was very, very unusual -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- to us. 

Q: And when -- when you and Morris first 
g o t married and your parents were still 
living in  New York , wh at was your -- didyou know -- did you so cialize with a lot 

of Jewish people, did you go 
to synagogue? Was it -- w as it -- 

A: Never. 

Q: No, never? Really? 
A: No, never, never. 
Q: Really? 

A: Never.  
Q: Hm. 
A: I think it was important 
-- I™m sure it was important to
 Morris™s family that he 
married a Jewish person, but they  didn't 
quite know. They -- they -- they didn™t 
understand really, who we were. I mean, we li
ved in very integrated society. And I -
- there was recently at the mu
seum a very nice guy from Israel who had -- he must 
have had a very, very high
 position in Israel now b
ecause everybody was running 
around him like he was really somebody impor
tant. And he -- we found out that he 
had been in Zagreb the -- this is another 
thing that has very little to do with me, but 
in a way maybe it™s interesting. He camefrom a place called Gradisca originally, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
32
which is in the Burgenland, 
wh ich is on the border of Sl
ovenia and Austria. And it 
is populated mo stly by people who were -- who came, I don™t know in which 
century, probably in  the 17
th
 or 18
th
 century from a very poor part of Croatia to this 
area. It™s on the border, sort of Austria, Slovenia, Hungary. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Okay. And they™re always 
-- they kept their national costume and they kept their 
songs and th ey used to go around all over 
the -- all over cro -- Yugoslavia and in 

other places to sing. These were well know
n minorities who, after I don™t know how 
many centuries still kept their language and 
everything else. So this gentleman from 
Israel tells me that he orig
inally came from there. His fa
ther had a factory in this 
Burg enland and he told me the name of th
e town, I think is Firestaat, I™m not quite 
sure what it was. And he was a refugee wi
th his family in Za
greb and th ey were 
very Orth odox and he told 
me about -- they had a separa
te synagogue, they had the 
separate -- it wasn™t a synagogue, it was a se
parate place where they  went to pray or 
they had that -- I had no idea these people 
existed. I had absolu
tely no idea. In the 
Jewish school where I went, my  grade scho
ol was the Jewish school in Zagreb, 

there were a few Sephardim, very few. An
d there were -- I suspect from the same 
family -- 
Q: From Bosnia? 
A: The Sephardim were from Bosnia -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
33
Q: Yeah, okay. 
A: -- originally, I™m sure. I can™t imagine 
any other place. But some Orthodox Jews, 
because I know that the boys were -- wore 
pants and I think they wore a hat, or a -- 
or a -- or a [indecipherable] or whatever. 
They were very, very poor. These were 
from around Zagreb somewhere and they were
 dressed -- I will not say that they -- 
they weren't -- you know, th
ey were wearing jackets, what kids would wear, 
lederhosen , God forb id. They  wo uld wear 
some jackets and so on and now when I 
look at these pictures I s
ee how they™re really quite di
stinct. And apparently these 
people had a -- had a -- not a synagogue, ce
rtainly a place where they  gathered  and 

so on. So this gentleman now from -- fro
m -- who came from Israel was telling me 
about that. By the wa
y, the museum was fantastically
 helpful to him. They  found 
some books that -- about stuff that his fath
er had told  him originally, and he never 
could check it out and he saw it, tears were
 going down his face, I mean, it was just 
unbelievable. But this gentleman told me th
at he had class and that they were very 
religious, although not weari
ng any kind of garb, and th at he -- he had the different 
rabbi. I mean, he didn't know ab out our rabbi
s, and so -- he was a child there and so 
on. Now wh at I found out la
ter about these peoples -- about this -- this place, 

Gradisca, which now is Austria, is that th
ey had parallel city go
vernments, they had 
a parallel Jewish and non-Jewish police, 
a parallel Jewish and non-Jewish fire 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
34
brigad e and various other things like that
. So during various holidays they would 
spell each other.  
Q: Wow. 

A: So an  -- I had no idea about that -- 
Q: I™ve not heard of such a thing. 
A: -- he told me that. 

Q: Huh. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Huh. Now, this is -- 
A: I also didn™t even know that there we
re that many Jews th
ere. I remember -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- you know, I can think of Croats and 
singing and fo lk costumes, but apparently 
there was a very, very large Jewi
sh community in 
that place.  
Q: Hm. 
A: Strange. 
Q: Yeah. It™s interesting that you were 
in New York at that time, w h ere so many 
Jews had come from eastern Europe. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And you know, starting life all over. An
d -- and you didn't know that many Jews, 
and you didn™t -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
35
A: No. 
Q: It™s interesting. 
A: On the other hand, there was a very ni
ce auth -- actually, I -- I did know, I mean, 
this guy, this Polish person who -- who 
was a -- who -- who was a partner of my  
father, they had come -- but 
I think they had come earlier. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And they were not -- they were not Orth
odox or anything lik
e that. In fact, the 
daughter married somebody, a 
very, very Conservative person, wh ose name I can™t 
reme mb er now, who I think is either at 
Harvard or Princeton who -- who you hear 
every once in awhile, I -- I™ll 
think of the name. But no, 
they -- yeah, then in New 
York there was a wonderful pa
stry shop called Elite. Th 
-- I think it -- yeah, Elite. 
The -- Elite was on 72
nd
 Street between, I think Broa
dway and wh atever the next 
street was, and that™s wher
e everybody got togeth er from various parts of -- these 

were central Europeans, they were not eastern Europeans. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: They were Germans, Austrians, Yu
goslavs, maybe Czechs. And that Austro-
Hungarian pastry was what was -- 

Q: Attracted them. 
A: -- trac -- was there, and I guess maybe 
the owners were there and large coffees 
with heap s of wh ipped cream and so on. Th
ey have disappeared. And they all read, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
36
including my father and so  on, was a -- 
an -- a newspaper called The Aufbau. Have 
you heard about that? It™s a very interes
ting -- it was a p aper people were looking -- 
first of all it was political, it was very 
interesting politically. And secondly you 
would find ads. People look
ing and looking fo r so and so from such and such a 
place, anybody know whether th
is person survived or not. 
This went on for years -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- years. And lots of very liberal ed
itorials and so on. I don™t know wh ether it 
still exists, but it was called The Aufbau. An
d as I said, they all sat around waiting 
for better times, yeah. I™m not quite sure 
when we started hearing about -- about -- 
really. We knew about conc
entration camps, but we 
didn™t know about killing 
camps until fairly late. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Later than we should. 

Q: ™45 -- ™44 -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- ™44. 
A: Yeah, yeah. And there weren™t any, as
 a matter of fact. I mean, maybe there 

were, but they were -- 
they were -- it was -- 
Q: Yeah. You got married in ™46? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
37
Q: And what [indecipherable]  
A: Do you? 
Q: No, I don™t, mm-mm. 

A: One of my daughters doesn™t 
want. Didn™t want and doesn™t. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: The other one has two. 

Q: Yeah. So what was your early -- the earl
y years of your marriage? What did your 
husband end up doing a
nd where did you live? 
A: We first lived with my parents for a 
very short time. Then  we moved one house 
fur -- one apartment building further on, in
 a studio on Riversid
e Drive. We were 
there, I™m n o t quite sure h-how long. My 
husband was trying to find a job, didn™t 
find a job, he -- my father was, I th
ink, hoping that he would be maybe a 
businessman, which was the -- the -- the mo --
 two times that he -- he tried, it w as 
disastrous, and he was ve
ry unhappy, and so th at
 never -- one of them, 
unbelievably, was with a guy who -- who made
 Desenex, if you know wh at that is. 
Q: Oh [indecipherable] 
A: Okay , you can imagine wh at fun th at wa
s. But at that time it was just beginning, 
they™re probably making millions now. 
Q: That™s right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
38
A: Okay. That wasn™t quite his thing.
 Then my uncle go
t involved -- do you 
remember L™il Abner?  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Do you remember the shmo
os? Shmoos were little fat 
things that would -- that 
would swoon and fall on th e st -- on -- on -- 
just to please you and you could eat 
them, and that made them very happy, or
 whatever. So my  uncle started -- I don™t 
know how he got -- I t h ink 
he got connected with Al 
Capp so mehow, and Al C -- 
my  uncle who was a lawyer, who by th at
 time had come from Cuba -- via Cuba, 
let™s put it. He started the shmoo busine
ss and they had little boxes with shmoos on 
it and a tiny little, you know, s -- s -- candy 
in the little boxes, and I don™t know, 
you know, these little rings, or little -- little
 ch arms, or w h atever, were stuck in 
there. And this went for awhile, and th
ey didn™t do very  we
ll, can you well -- you 
can well imagine it. Then th
is fell apart and one of th
e people who had meanwhile 
come from Yugoslavia, via 
I™m not sure how, not easily, had come -- who -- who 
was an extremely well-off person. If I tell you that he owned the salt monopoly in 
Yugoslavia -- 
Q: Oh. 

A: -- and various other odds 
and ends like that. And he 
had two sons, one of them 
was a year, maybe two -- no, two years ol der than me, who -- one time I think the 

families ma y have thought we™d
 get married, but neither he ever wanted to, or I -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
39
mean wa -- not even. And we 
were constantly having -- we
 were -- we were always 
trying to outdo each other in one thing or an
other and th-this started when we were 
quite small and we were both riding, and we 
were supposed to -- to have a -- have a 
-- I don™t know, a trial for a -- for a horse 
show. And, I think I was maybe 11 then 
and we had -- my  mo ther was in Vienna at the time and I had gone with a man na -- 
not with a man, he was the governors by th
at time, to this place where -- where we -
- we were supposed -- supposed  to practice by jump  -- not jump ing, but various 

other odds and ends. And there was this 
very beautiful horse that was very 
unpleasant, very obstreperous and very -- 
not very good. And this -- he said he 
wouldn™t -- he wasn™t even thinking of 
riding this horse, and I was -- and I was 
going to  do some up -- one-upsmanship, I sa
id I would. And I did, and I had an  
absolutely horrible fall, they
 thought I would have had broken everything, I had a -- 
I had a problem. In -- in fact, I think I ha
 -- since that time I have problems with my  
-- not with memory, but with 
other things. It took -- nothing was broken. It was an 
unbelievable thing, but nothi
ng did. And th en this -- his father, the salt monopoly 
person, who I think by that time had changed 
his religion, decided to -- to go to the 
synagogue because it hadn™t -- it was me a
nd not his son who had gotten that fall. 
And -- and -- and what else did he do? Ye
ah, and he didn™t eat on Saturday until 
noon, or some other kind of thing like th
at. But we™ve always been friends. So 
anyhow, this guy arrived with a lot of m
oney and he even tually got a -- not a lot, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
40
well, back some money. Not quite as well as
 we did, because he -- they were much, 
mu ch better off than we were. In fact, 
their house in Zagreb now is the German 
embassy re sidence. No
, Austrian, Austrian. 
Q: Wow.  
A: Austrian. And the guy lives in New Yo
rk and is in not ve
ry good shape. But 
anyhow, my father s -- decided this is 
such a wonderful busin
essman, that Morris, 
who is such a miserable businessman, 
but does speak English and does have 
connections and so on, and cer
tainly knows the south, we went to Athens, Georgia, 
and they  bought --

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Lucie Rosenberg. This is tape numbe
r two, side A. Okay, so you -- you went 
with this fellow who came -- 
A: Yeah -- 
Q: -- to Athens -- 

A: -- his name was [indecipherable] and th
ere were -- there were quotas that were 
available for -- I think it was peanut oil,
 mo stly peanut oil. There were great 
shortages in the States and these people ha
d this oil at -- what you would call it? 
Not a factory, it was -- it was a plant. 
And then they woul
d homogenize some and 
then he would buy futu res, you know, lik
e -- like huge con -- railroad containers 
worth of stuff. And then if you were smart 
you made a lot of money, but they lost a 
lot of money. Drove my  husband up th
e wall and my father was absolutely 
convinced that this very sm
art businessman would do it and th is very nice person 
who could, you know, talk to
 other people, could do anything, fell apart. Morris felt 
awful. We lived in Atlant
a for about a year and a half, I believe, at th e time. 
Q: Hm. Hm. 
A: I believe then we came back to New 
York and I became pregnant. Were -- we 
were -- we lived in a -- a project -- my moth
er said it was a project, it™s supposedly 
very sheik, you know, it was a -- was so
mething called Fresh Meadows, somewhere 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
42
in a -- not too far, let™s say, from La
Gu ardia airport, I would think th at 
[indecipherable] and so on. And still he coul
dn™t find a job and so  on. And then we -
- by that time my family in Venezuela sa
id to Morris -- oh, a
nd then there were 
several, again, suggestions, want you to  
chan ge your name. And he refused to do 
that and my -- up -- people at various plac
es made this suggestion. Well meaning, 
you know, nobody unpleasant. 
He said no, he wouldn™t, his father had come with 
his -- this name and, no. And he didn't wa
nt to find himself in a position wh ere he 
would, you know, not repres
ent himself [indecipherable] 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: He is -- he is so scrupulously honest
 it™s unbelievable, my  husband. I -- I -- I can 
sometimes tell a lie if it™s n
ecessary. No t a lie, but a, you k
now, a social lie, so -- but 
he can™t, he is straight arrow. An d -- as
, by the way, are both my  daughters. I don™t 
know that I™m devious, but under circumst
ances I guess I could tell a lie. You know, 
not -- not -- not for everyday use -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- but I could. So then -- my cousins by
 that time were in Venezuela. They had 
come via concen tration camps in Italy, and 
fo r about a year or so. I don™t know how 
long they were in Spain an
d my  father got them visas.
 They were going to go on 
further, I think, I™m not quite sure where in South America, but they stayed there 
and they  did very , very  well, extremely we
ll. And at the time the place was really 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
43
starting to move, and they asked my  husband
 to come and see if there™s anything he 
would like to do there. He did an d we -- 
I came over and then he -- the AP person 
was kicked out because he 
wrote something about the 
-- the person who was the 
dictator then. And then they asked my hus
band to take his place, which he did and 
then later he turned, he -- 
he was running a -- he and another guy, whose husband 
was -- whose son was just recentl y  with Br
emer, asked for him and he was in -- in 
[indecipherable]. A very nice guy by the na
me of Horand. He and Morris then were 
running an English language page
 in one of the local papers. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And then  a -- he was doing, he
 was working for a fee and -- 
Q: Was this Caracas? 
A: It was in Caracas. 
Q: Mm-hm. And you had a baby by then? 

A: By -- we -- I had gone with a baby. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: With a, I think, nine months old baby,
 with Jane. And my  aunt was there and my  
cousin who is the nearest relative I now 
have, she™s two and a half years younger 
than I am, who had married a guy from 
Belgrade. A sephard -- Sephardi -- but, 
oddly enough he was told by at -- it™s a very
 interesting thing with -- his name is 
Pinkas and when we -- when he got -- yo
u know, wh en  -- when his sons started -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
44
went to the Jewish schooling -- wh ere, by th
e way, my  Jane also went for awhile, 
was a very good school. He -- the director 
of the school said, listen, nobody called 
Pinkas is a s -- originally a Sephardi, 
how did this happen? So  wh at probably  
happened was that th
e mo ther was Sephardic and the fa
ther married into the family 
so all the -- 
Q: Kids. 

A: -- not all the ki -- all the -- all th e 
customs and th e food and everything was 
Sephardic and he considered himself Sepha
rdic. I mean, he had 
[indecipherable] I 
guess. But he also said that
 when he came from the concen
tration camp to Madrid -- 
I think they came [indecipherable] to Madrid
, that it was incredib
le. That it smelled 
like in his mother™s kitchen, that the fo
od had the same names as in his mo ther™s 
kitchen, that it all tasted like that, it was to
tally familiar. They di
d very well, and he 
is su -- they™re very charitable, they™ve 
given money left and 
right and he has now 
paid for th e publication of an ex tremel
y interesting [indecipherable] now it™s the 

second volume, a book -- a book called ﬁM
ismo  Prezimali,ﬂ ﬁWe Surviv ed.ﬂ And 
it™s a -- it™s a collection of stories of pe
ople from all over, from Croatia, from serv -- 

Serbia, from everywhere, who surv
ived  various camp s and so on. 
Q: And what™s their family name? 
A: Pinkas. 
Q: Pinkas. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
45
A: P-i-n-k-a-s. His name is -- his -- his r
eal name is Haim, but he was never known 
as anything but Milat. And her name is 
Mia, Maria. So -- and her -- her maiden 
name was Mueller. And -- wh ich, by the way was the name of one of our 
archbishops in Zagreb. And she -- so they 
-- they had first once 
and then the second 
son and I -- my -- my second daughter was 
born while we were in Caracas, Mary . 
Partly in -- called Mary for Maria my c
ousin, Mia and my  brother, who was Mario, 
and a very  good friend, a Serbian friend 
who was there, who was Mara Sajonski, 
was also Maria, so -- 
Q: What year was th
e second one born? 
A: ™56. 
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: In Caracas. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I love her birth certificate, which is
 in Span ish. And it starts off by saying, 
this day of so and so  presented himself 
before me Morris Rosenberg, a -- a citizen 
of the United States who claims to be the father of -- 

Q: Claims to be. 

A: Yes. [reads Spanish] and so on. 
Q: Right, right, who says he is the father. 
A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
46
Q: Great. How lo ng did you stay then, in
 -- in Venezuela? He was working as a 
journalist. 
A: He was working -- I™m trying to think 
exactly how many years we were there, 
quite a few. By that time my mother had 
died . You know, I don™t know exactly the 
date, I wil -- forget. We were in New York
 when there was some 
-- oh, then what I 
didn™t say was that my husband th en 
-- there w -- there was a weekly English 
language paper, a weekly, called the ﬁCaracas
 Daily Journal,ﬂ which he turned into 
a daily. And it™s not the paper th-that -- page
 that I told you th e English page, that 
was in a place called [indecipherable] I be
lieve. And we were in New York and 

there was -- on vacation visiting my  father, 
to -- getting ready to go to New York, to 
-- to Europe, I believe, when there was so
me kind ofbusiness 
manipulation and he 
found out that it wa -- he didn
™t want to stay there any mo re. They didn™t really oust 
him, but practically. There was a reason. 
I™m f -- I™m not quite sure how -- how it 
went, but anyhow, he never went back. He
 didn™t ba -- go back  for various other 
reasons, and so on. And meanwh ile, a very
 good friend of ours who had previously 
worked for Standard Oil of New Jersey, 
I believer it was, ha
d been work ing -- I 
think he was already in the Ford Foundati
on and he -- he asked him to join as a 
director for east we -- east -- for -- it wasn™t
 east west [indecipherab le] I™m not quite 
sure how. They started at the -- the Institu
te of International Education, and he was 
just started and they  started exchanges wi
th  the Soviet Un ion and Yu goslavia, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
47
they were bringing in scholars and student
s and so on. And then
 he took a group of 
U.S. governors thro ugh a very ex tensive trip through th e Soviet Union, and th ere 
was a lot of, you know, brotherhood and such
 going on. And then  he found th at this 

really bored him terribly because of the di
rector of -- of -- of the Institute of 
International Education said Morris, why 
don™t you present -- you know, do a paper 
on th at or give a suggestion on that and he
 would do it within 48 hours, and the man 
said you™re supposed  to take two months 
to do that. You -- you
™re making life very 
hard for the rest of us. And this went on 
and on and on like that til finally he -- he 
wasn™t very happy about that. I mean, it 
was extremely interesting, but -- and by 

that time students were coming in and 
graduate students mostly from -- from 
Yugoslavia to Russian
, so I was -- I thought it was in
teresting, but it wasn™t fast 
enough fo r him. So meanwh ile, a friend of
 his at the Associated Press said, 
wouldn™t you please join our
 [indecipherable] services? 
[indecipherable] time and 
he said yes. And then  we were in New Yo
rk til -- again, I can™t tell you ev erything, 
we were there for about two years, two and 
a half years. They  -- and then he had all 
sorts of, you know, reporting trips all ove
r the world, you know, mostly Latin 
America. A nd after that -- let me q u ickly 
th ink how th at would -- okay, they asked 
him to go to  Mexico  as bureau chief. And ag
ain, don™t ask me for dates. Where we 
were on and off for, I think six or 
eight years, something like that. 
Q: So, sounds like earl y  60
™s you were in the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
48
A: Yeah -- 
Q: In Mexico. 
A: -- yeah, yeah. 

Q: Mm-hm. Mm. Your mothe
r™s -- when -- before you 
-- when  you were going out 
with this English fellow -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: Your mo ther was afraid that you were 
going to  go off to the colonies and she 
was going to  lose you. 
A: I think maybe England mo re than a
nything. The poor guy was, you know 
[indecipherable]  
Q: But you -- but you ended up 
traveling all over the world. 
A: Yeah, of course. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But the th ing was -- no, no, she thou
ght -- she thought I would be happy in  
England.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: My -- all my things that I had left -- I 
had been in school in
 England, I had left 
there wearing th at disguise, Mother™s house. And I got them after the war. 
Q: Right. 
A: But he was killed, poor soul --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
49
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- in Burma, and it was -- it was pretty sad. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I™m sure it wouldn™t have been  su
ccessful in any way [indecipherable] 
Q: Yeah, yeah. So we™re 
up to the early 60™s, let™s take a break, okay. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Let™s do that. [tape break] Okay, we
™re back. We™re going to make a little 
correction here to some of the dates that
 we™ve been talking about, so go ahead, 
Lucie. 

A: Okay. We arrived in Venezuela in 19
50 because Mo rris couldn™t find an y kind 
of job in New York  and I had family there 
that had just, a few years earlier re -- 
gotten to Venezuela via camps in Italy, vi
a Spain and then arrived th ere, I think 
their destination was somewhere else, but th
ey stopped there and it seemed to have 
been a very good environm
ent for them in every way.
 And Venezuela was really 
thriving at the time in spite of a very u npleasant dictatorship and -- okay. It -- it 

worked. And as I say, I -- I was so me -- not
 some, but I was quite depressed. I di -- 
didn™t speak Spanish. 
I helped myself with a little bit 
of Italian, but there we were 
and Mo rris then found a job with -- with A
ssociated Press eventu
ally, and we stayed 
in Venezuela until 1958. This
 was the time w h en I was teaching English in various 
places. It started out the suggestion of a 
friend of ours who work ed for the U.S. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078

government, was at th e embassy. At that tim
e United States was setting up so called 
bi-national centers throughout Latin Amer
ica [speaks foreign language here] this 
[indecipherable] that. And this particular 
one at the time was in
 downtown Caracas 
in an old, very beautiful colonial house,
 but obviously not meant for a school. There 
was a huge patio with a lovely huge tree in
 which there was a sloth that would turn 
up ev ery so often. An d also a Hungaria
n émigré opened abarba -- opened a 
steakhouse there. It was very nice, on one en
d of it. And th e rest of it around th is 
patio were classes. And I started giving cl
asses to all V enezuelans of one kind or 
another. Also Span iards who came, who 
worked, it was very strange, you would 
have -- for instance you would have Venezu elans who were -- who hardly  had an 

education at all who were very, very tale
nted and learned the language very fast, 
whereas you had Sp aniards who were -- with
 -- with university degrees who were 

really having problems in -- 

Q: Hm, with English. 

A: -- with English. 
Q: Hm. 
A: And this was going on fo r awhile 
among -- there were various American 
companies that sent their -- their -- th
eir employees that needed to learn the 
language -- 

Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
51
A: -- over to the center. So after awhile, a 
large hotel opened up,
 a -- belonging to 
an American comp any, I believe it was Pan American who owned it, but there was 
a hotel called Tamana -- the hotel was calle
d Tamana Cuentos, the large new hotel 
in Venezuela. So these people were comi
ng from the site to this center, which was 
in the center of town. And th
en they decided that this
 was not good for them and 
they offered me a contract 
to simply go to the hotel and sit there and ask the 
employees, got enough time, they would co me
 and get a class. So then I invented 
some kind of very unscientific way of 
teaching them hotel English. Because you 
had to teach a chambermaid some thing else
 than you would have to teach a -- I 
don™t know, a bellboy or something 
like th at, or a waiter, etcetera. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So I made up a lil -- little -- little cl
asses and little phrasebooks for each one of 
them and they would come, and was wonderfu
l, in the middle of a patio with lovely 
flowers around and so on and th ey just 
wait for them. And we found, you know, 
that if they needed 
to  w o rk , th ey  w o rk ed , 
if they could come, they could come and I 
kept -- and I had a flat salary and it was really  very nice doing it. This went on for 
quite awhile, I don™t really reme mber exac
tly how -- for how long. And the rest of 
the time I h ad a very nice time with -- my 
cousins were there, there was a large 
Yugoslav community of one kind or anothe
r there. Mostly ref
ugees, mostly Jews, 
but not exclusive -- actually, not at all ex
clusively, there was a very successful 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
52
Dalmatian entrepreneur who was build in
g bridges and who was importing cement 
and so on. They™re -- th
ey™re still there, they™re very su
ccessful still. He™s in his 
80™s, but he still travels back and forth to
 Yugoslavia [indecipherable] to Croatia, 
let™s say, probably -- I --I -- he
 is from southern
 Dalmatia, I™m almo st certain. And 
then his sister came, an abso
lutely gorgeous wo man. And -- 
Q: Let me -- let me interrupt you, you ha
d this community, some of whom had a -- 
so-some of them were relatives, and -- and th
is is now, we™re talking 10 years or so, 
after the end of World War II. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You know, a lot of people that I talk 
to say that they -- th
ey didn™t talk mu ch 
about what they™d b
een through during the war, that 
these were years when  people 
were just making every effort to starting 
over and build ing a new life and that wh at 

was past was past and there really wasn
™t much talk about it. Was that your 
experience? I mean, you -- 

A: To a certain extent, not -- not 100 percent. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I think th ey talked  among each  other qu
ite a bit. This was a very heterogeneous 
group. I™m just thinking, for 
instance, my -- my aunt™s 
very closest relative was a 
woman, a Serbian woman from Novi Sad, who lost her son, actually, who drowned 

in Lake Geneva when there were refugees
 there. And then he
r husband died very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
53
fast, so you know, she was ab
sorbed into the community. So
me of them had been in 
the same camps in Italy. There -- there 
was only one woman th
at I know who had 
actually been to a very unpleasant, very -- I mean, in the actual k
illing camp in -- in 
Germany. No, I don™t think so. I -- I think th
ey talked. They didn
™t talk -- yeah, th-
they -- they -- they talked am
ong each other the mo st of.  
Q: Yeah. But your experience was qu
ite different from most of them. 
A: Yes, absolutely. 

Q: Because you™d gotten out. 
A: Yes, I -- I didn™t experience any of that, and I -- truly I -- I -- there was a guilt 
feeling. 

Q: You did? 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Hm. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Did your parents ha
ve that feeling too? 
A: I don™t think so. 

Q: Really? 

A: I don™t think so. I think they thought 
[indecipherable] may -- maybe to an  ex tent, 
you know, because my brother 
was killed, and he was a U.S. soldier, but I -- I -- I 
don™t think so. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
54
Q: Talk about that Lucie, how? 
A: Well, he -- he -- 
Q: No, I mean, talk about 
your feeling, about guilt. 
A: You know that you have
 so many of your friends, huge numb ers on all sides, I 
mean, Jews, Catholics, communists, Croatia
n Nationalists of one
 kind or another, 
even Ustaıas, that you know th -th-they
 were -- they -- they
 there were very 
ambivalent feelings there. But I don™t th
ink I was ever embittered. I don™t think 
even my -- my parents were. I™ve heard a 
lot of people who were, I don™t want to 
hear about these people any mo re, don™t talk  to me about it, I don™t care. But I -- I -- 

I -- I never had that feeling. I was always very much connected to it. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Possibly because I wasn™t there, 
possibly because there was -- you know, 
whatever I remember
ed was very nice. 
Q: Mm-hm. Were you in, during those years after the war, a-after you came to the 

U.S., were you in touch with people who stayed? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes. People who 
sort of started trickling back. 
Q: What do you mean, goi
ng back? Going back in -- 
A: No, people -- well, some -- so me went back, and jus -- in a very -- well, this was 

-- some very sad things happened. For inst
ance, my -- not my -- my -- my cousin, 
Mia Bauer Pinkas, she had the large family 
on her father™s side, th-the Bauers. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
55
among th em was Hanitsa Bauer, who -- whose father was a -- not a memb er of the 
communist party, but very left leaning an
d -- and actually  had 
all kinds of trouble 
with -- he -- he had to be very careful 
about it. One member of that family, a 
nephew, this was a guy who was a communist 
who was actually in jail at the age of, 
I don™t know, maybe 18 - 19, pre-war Yugo
slavia and who was killed in -- it was a 
national hero and was killed in -- in th
e jail. His name was [indecipherable] 
Friedman. So, okay, this was a left leani
ng family. Dr. Bauer an
d Anitsa, after being 
an -- in ital -- in an Italian camp went to
 London and sp ent the 
blitz in England. 
They were the first ones to 
go back. Not with the governm
ent in exile, but with -- I 
don™t know, [indecipherable] was liberate
d and there was a government. I don™t 
know whether it was really a government, 
but yeah, it was, formed, he went back. 
He was a -- he was a x-ray specialist,
 a radiologist. And he, I think he was 
[indecipherable] in uniform as a colonel to
 the Yugoslav army, Tito™s army and so 
on and he was on th e on th e 
[indecipherable] for awhile. And his daughter Anitsa 
also went, I don™t know wh at
 happened to the wife, I th
i nk -- I guess she must have 
gone, too. And after awhile they went to 
Zagreb. This was not a good thing. They  
were, after awhile very disappointed that
 -- what was going on. I believe one of the 

sayings were -- were -- were
 you -- you were convenien
tly in London during the 
war while we were in the mo
untains. And I think there may have ev en been some 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
56
intimations of anti-Semitism, but I will not 
swear, I will not say that. They ended up 
by going to Israel. 
Q: Hm. 

A: And then from Israel to Venezuela. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did a lot of Jews from Croatia go to Israel? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Not immediately. 
Q: Right. 
A: Not immediately, but after awhile many did. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And there had been a group already ther
e of -- of real Zionists before -- you 
know, before there was actually an Israel
 [indecipherable] during the mandate, there 
was a -- a k ibbutz of Jews from -- from Yu
goslavia, from that -- maybe early 30™s, 
maybe -- 

Q: In Croatia someplace? 
A: No, no, in Israel they went -- 

Q: Oh, in Israel? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
57
A: They -- that was one of the most horribl
e things that I re -- 
read now when I was 
working in the muse
um, in the Holocaust Museum. 
There was an attempt [phone 
rings] during -- maybe in 1941 -- ™40 -- ™41 or
 ™42 to bring a -- the group of Jewish 
children to Israel via Turkey  -- via -- fro
m hung -- yeah , via Hungary and to Turkey, 
and then  from Turk ey to Pa
lestine. [tape break] I was 
talking about this group of 
Jewish children that were being ev
acuated, su pposedly,
 via Turkey -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- to Israel. And I saw, in the museum
 now, lists -- and I don™t know how this 
came, this was probably st -- 
came with all th -- all -- all 
the papers, all the -- all the 
documents that were photographed in -- 
I me an, not photographed, whatever you 
do, copied  in -- in Zagreb
 from -- from the archives. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Endless lists of what these children ha
ve to  bring along as clothing, and I mean, 
most of them are -- were killed. But the 
list consisted of two pair of pajamas, g y m 
clothes, shoes --that means special slippers
 for gym. For a little gi
rl such and such, 
so many pair of socks, for little boys that
 many underwear. This was absolutely -- 
you know, and that they  were changing 
them, they were not the same. And the 
terrible story about this is that one of th
e wo man, who by the way is part of that 
Bauer family. A woman -- a woman who was an
 entrepreneur by herself in Istanbul 

in the lumber business. I think she wa
s a widow and she was -- she was in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
58
lumb er business in Istanbul. And one of th
e people who was sup
posed to come was 
her grandson, whose name was Fayja, I fo
rget the surname. He™s a boy of maybe 
eight, 10, not sure how -- and -- and I saw him on the list, by th e way. And -- and 
the list kept changing, too,
 you know. I don™t know wh
ether these children have 
been -- since then some were
 -- been taken away, some 
-- th-there -- there was all 
kinds of [indecipherable] going on there. A nd finally this group arrived in Istanbul, 

and -- wh ich was known by th e way, 
Croatia society [indecipherable] 

A: Oh, I didn™t know th at. 
Q: Yeah. And it was met, among other people, by this lady. And th is lady was 
running around and calling this Fayjus™ 
name. And the local boy presented himself, 
but it was not Fayja. And you can im
agine what kind of a scene that -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Lucie Rosenberg. This is tape numbe
r two, side B. But you were saying that 
when this group of children arrived in Istanbul -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- this woman met the group and this 
-- a boy an swered to her grandson™s name -
- 
A: A boy son -- a boy ans -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
59
Q: -- but it wasn™t him. 
A: -- but it wasn™t him. But wh at had happe
ned, this boy died in Zagreb of an 
infectious disease while these lists were, 
you know, still [indeciph
erable]. And the -
- inserted into the group of
 I don™t know, there had to be that many that were 
permitted to go, was a child from Hungary, 
who was told to say he was Fayja so 
and so. 
Q: Wow. 

A: And you can imagine that grandmother 
who thought this child had been  saved. 
And i -- it -- 
Q: Jeez, sh e must have been frantic. 

A: She was totally frantic. By
 the way, there™s a relative 
of this person in  New York  
who™s a -- who came on a totally different 
-- who came with some kind of child 

transport from France, and boy -- and -- and 
to some foster parents in New Jersey. 
And he is a very well-known scientist at
 NYU, and he™s work in
g on that famous 
accelerator in -- in -- in Geneva, or in
 -- on the -- on the border with France. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And this was a -- 

Q: And he was on one
 of those trains. 
A: But not this transport, this wa
s a totally different, this was a -- 
Q: You know what -- 
roughly what year th
is wouldhave been? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
60
A: I think th is mu st have been ™4 1 - ™42. 
Q: Yeah. And were there many groups of chil
dren that went out of Croatia like that? 
A: I only know of th is one, there may have
 been others. I™m -- there were various 
ways of kids being 
pulled out, but this was an official group and th is was going 
through -- through the -- I guess the German
s and the -- the Croatian authorities and 
their -- I™m telling you, there was more pa
perwork on -- on -- on what they were 
allowed to bring with th em, including gym 
clothes. This was very important. And -- 
Q: And did they make it to Israel? 
A: They made it to Israel. 
Q: Yeah? 

A: Yeah. From Istanbul. Amazingly, one pe
rson who actually I -- I don™t -- he -- he 
is not rela -- related to them. There™s a ma
n here who was working at the Institute of 
Peace, who is married to this 
-- let™s see, she™s not a relative of mine, but she is -- 
sh-sh-she is a -- a close relative of a -- of 
-- of my cousins, I m
ean, sh e™s -- she™s a -- 
my  cousin -- they have the same gra
ndmother, let™s put it that way, or great-
grandmother, some -- anyhow, she -- she™
s a blood relative. She™s not my blood 
relative, she™s a rela
tive who went to -- who spent th
e war -- I know I -- probably in 
Italy. Her -- her mother was the sister of 
this guy, Browning that I told you who was 
the -- the famous leftist and -- and -- and a 
national hero and -- in -- in -- in Croatia. 
This m-ma -- this person whose name is Tu
val, who was this professor and -- lately, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
61
but he was at Harvard and he
™s also at -- at th e university in Jerusalem and who 
worked here at the In
stitute of Peace, and this is -- 
is -- is a very wonderful scholar. 
His father -- they -- they had emi -- im
migrated very much earlier from Novi Sad. 
They  were well known Zionists and his fath
er went to Israel. I think they lived -- 
they lived in Jerusalem. A
nd he went thro ugh grade scho
ol and unive -- and th en -- 
and high school and university in -- in Isr
ael o r m -- and then came to the States and 
studied and then went back. There™s a big 
tragedy in that fam
ily, too, but I won™t 
tell you about. He was work ing with a Je
wish a -- Jewish agency , I believe, the 
father. This person was w-working with a Je
wish agency  in Istanbul. And the Papal 
Nuncio in Jerusalem w as th
e wonderful pope, you know, 
the -- John the whatever, 
the -- the -- the super pope. He 
was nice, wonderful pope was -- 
Q: What -- hang on a second. [tape break] 
A: Yeah, well by then already -- but he was Pope John. 

Q: Yeah, 24
th
.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Who helped out with -- wi
-wi -- with all kinds of -- 
of immigration things and 
helped out with the 
Germans and so on, was absolute
ly wonderful in
 every way.  
Q: Mm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
62
A: So, you know, th-ther -- th
ere was stuff going on, ther
e were undergrounds, there 
were -- there were official ways, there -- a
nd, you know, there™s that -- this was the 
time of the mandate, there was no Israel [indecipherable] 
Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do -- wa
s there any -- did your father
 ever consider going to 
Israel instead of the United States? 

A: I -- I don™t think so. He was very touched 
when  he first came to Israel, when he 
visited, he -- he actually felt at
 home. I -- I -- I did not.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I did not.  
Q: In those years after you all came to Ne
w Yo rk and -- and th en when you went to 
Venezuela, were you -- did you keep an 
active involvement in a synagogue, were 
you -- did you consid er yourself active Jews? 

A: Yes, I -- you know, you are what you are. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: This -- this was never a re -- a re
ligious community, bu
t for instance, my 
daughter Jane went to  Jewish gr
ade school in -- in Caracas. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

A: It was a very excellent school and 
ya -- she -- actually she learned to write 
Hebrew and -- and -- and Spanish at the sa
me time, because this
 was bilingual and 
this -- it was span -- it was 
called -- what was it called? Escuela [indecipherable] my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
63
God, how is this, how am I forgetting th
at? [speaks foreign language here] it was 
called. And one of her first teachers [inde
cipherable] was a -- brought from Israel 
and she was of Bosnian descent. 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah. A very nice woman. The other one 
was, I guess, either Russian Jewish or 
Polish Jewish or whatever. It was a very
, very  good school, and it had the regular 
curriculum of the Venezuel
an government, you know, what
ever the Ministry of 
Education had, plus a Jewish curriculum. 
So, you know, there wa -- there was never 

any -- any doubt in any of that. All -- 
Q: What do you -- what do you
 mean, any doubt about what? 
A: I mean, you know, I was Jewi
sh, I was Jewish. It was -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- it was -- 

Q: You weren 't going to turn
 away from it for any reason. 
A: No. 
Q: Many people did. 
A: No, I didn™t 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I mean, how could I when -- no. Also, 
when we got back 
to New York , about 
which we will speak later, my 
father insisted that Jane go to a Sunday school in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
64
New Yo rk, a Jewish Sunday school. And nu
m -- and -- and when we were in -- in 
Mexico, I had -- Mary went off to a Jewish
 Sunday school. Not for long, but she did 
go. And Jane did, and so 
on. But neither of them ar
e religious in any way. 
Q: Really? 

A: No.  
Q: Hm. 

A: That was not a very religious family. 

Q: Your -- your parents? 
A: Yeah. No, no. I mean, ther
e were certain customs that were kept and that was it. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I mean if -- it was like y
ou had dark hair or light hair
 or whatever, it was part of 
your -- your being an d that was it. And that
 had a feeling, you know, that it didn™t 
really require any -- any -- any nurturing. 
I -- maybe that was a mistake, I mean, 
they -- they™re well aware of everything andthen, in fact, Jane married a non-Jewish 

person who then, at his own 
behest became a -- a -- conver
ted to Judaism and in his 
second marria -- marriage, married another Je
wish wo man. I thought that was quite 
interesting. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m, mm-h m.  
A: And the other one, I mean, considers 
hims elf -- he was born a Protestant, but -- 
but he™s totally irreligious and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
65
Q: When  your daughters -- your daughte
rs both knew your father and mo th er. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And I™m wondering how it was explained to
 them how your -- they came to be in 
the United States, how you came to be. Did 
-- did they  know the whole story about -
- 

A: Yes -- 

Q: -- your leaving and -- 

A: -- yes. 
Q: -- and the Holocaust in general -- 
A: Abso lutely. 

Q: -- from the beginning? 
A: From the very beginning. 
Q: It™s been an -- it™s an issue with a lot of people -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- how to tell the young people. 
A: No, we -- this -- this 
was very straightforward. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And they  were among people i -- i -- i 
-- who -- who talked about it one way or 
another. I mean th-this was very fresh in my
 cousin™s memory, for 
instance in -- in -

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
66
- in Caracas. She was surround
ed by people who 
had been in this camp and that 
camp and it was -- it was daily conversations. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

A: And some of it was even fun. 
Q: How so? 
A: For instance, my cousin met her hus
band in -- in -- in -- actually, near 
Dubrovnik, but they were -- they were all 
-- both sent to a camp in Albania and the 
romance developed then  -- then, and th en they
 were sent to a camp in -- in Italy and 
it continued. And when  they 
finally -- this -- this is a
nother thing that very few 
people talk about and has -- has nothing to
 do with my familie
s, but I do want to 
come back to that. You know,
 they -- they -- they had th
eir own social life and they 
tried to cook and so on together. There 
was memories that they talked about. 
Q: Mm-hm. The camps that your cousin we
re in were more like detention camp s 
than [indecipherable] 
what we think of -- 
A: They were concentration 
camps, but they were not -- 
they were not killing camps 
of any kind. 

Q: Right. They were 
forced labor camps? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: No. Maybe detention is more that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
67
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. One of them I for -- one of them
 was in -- in -- under Italian -- this was 
obviously by -- at that time Albania wa
s under Italian occupation, had been fo r 
some time and they were br
ought from the Dalmatian coas
t to -- to Albania and I 
don™t know exactly how long th ey were there,
 but they -- they were then taken to -- 
by the Italian army, or Italian authorities 
to another camp which was called ferra -- 
Ferramonti di Tarsia in -- I forget wher
e -- where exactly in Italy it was. [tape 
break] Think we was talking about the groups and -- no, I don™t rememb er. [tape 

break] -- went over that they -- they -- th
ey came to Spain and from -- and Spain, 
they sent this telegram to
 us and then my father wa
s going around to  find out who 
would give them visas and a
ffidavits and -- and obviously  
deposits at the consulates 
for money and then  that™s how it -- how th ey
 got there, they™re all doing very well 
now.  

Q: Hm. 

A: And they were -- Dr. Bauer actually wa
s a Zionist, was an active Zionist. My 
aunt™s husband. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: My cousin Mia™s husband. 
Q: Mm-hm. But that™s the only one? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
68
A: There -- there were some who were ma
ybe mo re -- yeah. But on the other hand, 
my  cousin didn™t go to Jewish school in 
Zagreb and I did. I did go to  the Jewish 
school where obviously you had the regul
ar Yugoslav curricu
lum for -- for grade 
school, it went from one to four. And -- plus Hebrew. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And actu -- and Biblical 
history. And at that time already, there w -- and I™m 
talking in the early 30™s -- late 20™s, earl
y 30™s, there were, in Croatian, Zionist 
children™s magazines with be
autiful woodblocks in it. And I still remember the 
name of one of them -- an -- of the ma
in one, it was ca-called [indecipherable]. And 
I think it -- they were monthlies. Had st
ories about children, about Israel. About 
Palestine, not about Israel, about Pales
tine. And th ere -- there were people who 
were leaving. There was, in my  class in
 grade school, the son of th e big Zionist 
leader, whose name was Dr. Alexander Le
ite, who -- whose son was in my class 
and sadly the -- he died  at the -- I think th
e age of nine, maybe even 10, from scarlet 

fever. And that was a horrible loss. And D
r. Leite then went and -- and -- and was 
very, very active in -- 
in Israel. I think he -- I th -- I 
think he survived
. Yeah, I think 
he did. He went over there. And there 
was a younger daughter by the name of 
Tamara who may still be alive in -- in Israel. 
Q: Let me ask you about the 50™s. 
A: Mm-hm? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
69
Q: It was -- so Tito had taken power 
and there was so much repression there -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- in the 50™s and people were jailed and -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- still terrible th
ings going on there. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you have -- were you in touch 
with people who were there, who had 
survived in Zagr
eb and -- Jews or relatives who ha
d su rvived and stayed on, and did 
you have any co rrespondence 
or co nnection with them during those first 10 years or 
so after the war? 

A: Yes, we did, but those that survived we
re mostly leftists and those were people 
who would have been -- who 
would have been  partisans. 

Q: And come to power. 

A: And come to power. 

Q: Uh-huh, okay. 
A: And then somewhere, of course, I me
an, as I said, Dr. Richard Bauer decided 
this was not for him and he went --he went
 to Israel. I know a lot of people wh o 
finally did. The person that 
I mentioned to you before, 
aga -- who -- who lives here 
now, she was a little girl, her uncle -- a
nd she -- she -- most of her -- the war she 
spent with her grandmother, she 
tried to go -- they tried to get visas to go to Israel 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
70
and they  could not get a vi
sa and they could not get a visa. And finally they 
appealed the -- the -- the grandmother ap
pealed to one of the politburo members 
who had been in the same -- I don™t know wh
ether cell, b u t certainly in the same jail 
as her husband -- I mean as her -- as her 
son, Branimir. And there was no letter, but 
they suddenly got a permis
sion to leave for Israel. 
Q: Hm. 
A: So. 

Q: Mm-hm. Let™s go back to you and Morri
s are, in the late 50™s, you are in -- 
A: We are in -- 

Q: -- Venezuela. 

A: -- Venezuela. We™re still in Venezuela. 
Q: You go back to 
New York in 1958. 
A: Right. 
Q: For a couple more years? 

A: Yeah. This -- this was so
rt of unexpected, we were supposed to be on vacation 
and then  something happened with Mo rris™s j
ob, which I don™t want to go in to right 
now, it just got to be complicated, and -- 
and -- and Jane developed the measles, I 
believe, or something and we 
could -- we were supposed 
to have gone to Europe 
and we did not. And so he st
arted working for first -- the 
Institute for International 
Education for east west exch
ange. But he found that it 
was going mu -- it was very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
71
slow. I mean, he was given a project that 
was a -- that he finished within, I don™t 
know, three, four days and this was suppos
ed to take several weeks. And he ju st 
couldn™t stand it and then he quit. And mean
while, at the same ti
me, the Associated 
Press asked him to please come back a
nd he did. There was -- he was on a night 
shift or on -- on -- on -- on an awful shift 
and at we -- that was pretty stressful I 
must say. He hardly ever 
saw the children and so on. And -- but he had some very 
interesting [indecipherable] etcetera. A
nd we were there from ™58 to ™61. The 

amusing thing was I, having gone to -- going to
 a private high school in Yugoslavia 
pre-war, there mu st have been something 
wrong with  you. This
 was, you know, you 
-- th-that was -- it was look
ed down  upon in  a very se
rious manner. And I remember 
my  poor brother who had been
 in England and had lo st 
a year™s worth of national 
history in th e croa -- and th e national langua
ge. He, in order not to lose a year in 
high school, went to a private school and it 
-- that was the most dr
amat -- I mean the 
most horrible thing for him, he
 absolutely hated it, yeah. 
Q: I think that -- yeah, you told this story before. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So, you know, you went
 to a public school. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
72
A: And as we came -- as I said, as we ca 
-- as -- as -- when we came to New York I 
insisted that Jane go to a public scho
ol. And we bought this -- and what was 
supposed  to be a very  good public school
 was P.S. six and P.S. six was in an 
extremely expensive neighborhood and the 
only wa-way she c
ould have gone, we 
had to buy a con -- no, not
 condo, what you call, the -- th ese other things. 
Q: Co-op? 
A: Co-op. And finally as we, you know, 
after a year we saw that she was way 
ahead, and so she was taken out and sh
e went to the United Nations school. 
Q: Oh. 

A: Which was very good at that time. Th
e amazing thing was, 
you know, she would 
go there, changing buses twice with a friend. And there was, you know, she was 
about 10. It was very nice, that wa -- th
at was good. The same
 time I ran into 
somebody who had been a very intimate fri
end of mine for years of -- when we 
were both at Voice of America, and he
r name was Mira Mihalofska and her 
husband was the Polish U.N. ambassador there.
 We ran into -- into each other at the 
cocktail party. I had no idea that™s where 
she was. And we™d been  in touch ev er 
since. So one of the boys 
was in Jane™s class at the 
U.N. school, the ol-older one 
was also at the U.N., bu
t -- so that was good. 
Q: So you had three nice years there. 
A: Very nice. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
73
Q: Yeah. 
A: And also my father was there and there were -- and -- and an aunt of my 
mother™s who was still alive, who had su
rvived in the most 
horrifying manner. She 
was in Italy with her husband, who was a 
-- she was born in Hungary and she was -- 
she grew up in Osiek, her mar -- her -- her mo ther married a second time, a 

widower. And they were in something th
at was known as the con -- a confino 
libero. Confino libero consis
ted of you were in a small town  in Italy and you 
reported to  the police, I guess once a w -- da
y that you were there. And th ey were 
staying in a room or two rooms or whatev
er, in -- in some pensionne or wherever 
they were billeted. And that was it. An
d her husband apparently was -- had gotten 
some gold pieces that he must have been 
counting, or somebody was aware of the 
fact that he had them, and they -- some
 -- th-this had nothi
ng to do with the 
Holocaust or anything, these were plain 
old robbers, had killed him and hit her on 
the head and buried them both. And sh e 
woke up wh en  she came to and she was 
buried on top of her husband, and she crawled out. 

Q: Oh my. 
A: And saw the dead  husband there. 
And there was a big -- do I have, and I 
promised the mu seum that I would get all 
of these newspaper clippings in Italian 
and give it to them. Things like beautif
ul Jewess, you know, resurrected from the 
grave, so to speak. She wasn
™t beautiful at all, bu-but 
she was a younger person, so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
74
anyhow Italians were being very  comp limen
tary. And she stayed there and finally 
was permitted to go to Sw
itzerland where she worked as a maid. The Swiss were, 
you know, the Swiss were the 
way they were. And they pe
rmitted her to stay there. 
Again, she had to go, I think 
once a week or so or mayb
e even more often with a -- 
with a little I.D. with her pict
ure on it to present herself 
to the police that she was 
there and sh e worked as a maid, or cl
eaning woman, I™m not quite sure what. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And finally we were able to get her 
visa and sh e came to New Yo rk and she 
stayed with us for awhile. 

Q: Your father brought her. 

A: My mother. This was on my mother™s
 side. Her name was Clara Frankel. 
Q: Mm-hm. You mentioned here in the late 
50™s that your father was still alive. Had 
your mo ther passed away? 
A: My mother passed away yes, in her 
fi -- and we were still in Venezuela, 
somewhere like ™57 or so. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yup, but my father was fir -- h e came to
 us and then  he went
 wi -- he went on a 
trip around the world. And of co urse he™d
 been going back and forth to Yugoslavia 
a great deal. 

Q: Oh, he had? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
75
A: Yeah. 
Q: In the 50™s? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Hm. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What was he -- was he doing busin ess? 

A: No, he was seeing friends. He was workin
g on -- on this restitution that we were 
supposed to get and getting pa
pers together and so on. 
I still keep finding bits and 
pieces of paper that he was working on
. And seeing friends. He would go on 
vacation in the north, on -- do 
you know where Opatija is? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Okay, to Opatija for weeks 
at a time. And seeing friends. 
Q: When  did you finally go
 back for the first time? 
A: I™m trying to think -- have -- I went -- 
I truly -- I do -- I™m trying to rememb er 
whether I went with Morris and my uncle or
 whether I went with my father. I think 
I went with my father. Somewhere in the 50™s. 
Q: In the 50™s? 

A: Oh, yeah. 
Q: You had been gone ma -- no, 10 years? 
A: Yeah. Even less maybe, I™m -- 
you know, probably  10 years. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
76
Q: Mm-hm. And what was it like? 
A: It was sad. It was sad but it was nice too, because I saw friends. I went so see the 
house in the country, which was -- which 
was a ruin then, whic
h didn™t, you know, 
was a ruin, it was a ruin, I me -- I -- I st
arted getting sad and nos
talgic when they 
started rebuilding it, unnecessarily. But that
 -- it was -- it was just the way I had 
been sent photographs. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I saw various friends, some who had 
gotten married. Male friends, boy friends, 
whatever, people like that who I™d been in
 correspondence with all the time, an d -- 
and a few girlfriends. Then -- and -- and my
 father st -- o ddly enough, quite a few 
people that he knew were still aliv e, he
 was seeing them and so on. And by that t-
time -- by that time I think quite a few of 
the -- whoever was Jewish had left, unless 
that had been really very rabid leftists. 
My father™s very in
timate friend for years 
pre-war was the Yugoslav or Croatian, whatev
er you want to call it, sculptor, An tun 
Augustin
i
. And th ey had been in  contact pretty mu ch the -- forever, and he was a 
very close friend of Tito™s 
and he was very high up in 
the government. And I think 
when they were -- Yugoslavia gave as 
a present to the United Nations this 
equestrian statue which is still standing th
ere. When that was being put up my -- I 
don™t know whether Au gustin
i
 stayed with -- I was not, I was in probably -- I am 
-- I am not sure where I was, probably in 
Caracas at the time. He saw my father and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
77
then wh en  the statue was actually brought, he
 also brought the st -- this statue which 
was given to us, wh ich was -- which is part
 of a -- one of those partisan mo numents 
that are all over Yugoslavia and wh ich -- wh ic
h stood in our garden  in -- in Caracas 
and to which Mary referred to as la niña
 boomboom, because she has a -- she has a -
- a -- a gun in her hand, a -- a -- what is kno
wn  as a [indecipherable] in Croatian, but 
it™s -- it™s a submachine gun, as you can se
e. And there are many photographs of 
Mary standing holding on to th e niña boomb
oom in the garden . And that™s going to  
her, now I mean I™ve been dragging her ar
ou -- around the wo rld long en ough, so --

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: -- the holoco -- United States Holocaus
t Memorial Museum interview with Lucie 
Rosenberg. This is tape number three, side 
A. You were telling me  that your father -
- before we get back to  the -- the chronology -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- that your father was going back to Yu
goslavia in the 50™s, 
and that you went 
back for a visit. It™s so 
interesting to hear this, b
ecause you rarely hear it from 
Holocaust survivors -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- who were going back -- 

A: Right, right. 
Q: -- to see friends and -- and -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- what a unique experience for you. 

A: It was -- 
Q: Among survivors anyway. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: The sad part of course was that you 
kept getting details of who did what to 
whom, and that was very prevalent. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
79
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And one of the strangest 
-- I don™t know whether I told 
this story at all, maybe I 
did, if it™s -- came back and I started vi
siting people around th
e place and among oth 
-- and then , you know, Zagreb  is a very 
small town and was a much smaller town 
and suddenly the word was aha, she™s here
. And people started inviting me back and 
forth. So  one of the peop -- two people rema
in in my memory, that was first time I 
went back. One was -- were the parents of
 a childhood friend of mine by the name 
of Zlatan Blinavich. Zlatan Blinavich 
I knew when  he was 10 years -- when I was 
10 years old and he was 11 years old an
d we were sort of -- not childhood 
sweethearts, but anyhow, an interest. And 
we were -- the family was very Croatian 
nationalist, although I would have never th
ought of them as Ustaıa by any means. 
The mother, I believe, was Au
strian, but I™m not sure. 
Maybe German. Austrian, I 
believe. And he and I -- I mean, he went 
all to -- to, say the equivalent of my  
school, the [indecipherable] gymnasia, whic
h was in another part of town. But we 

played tennis together and 
we -- we were very close friends. That sort of -- held 
hands maybe, stuff like that. And he appare
ntly collaborated like crazy. If not more 
than collaborated and immediately after th
e war, took off for Argentina. And I had 
heard that. You heard all sorts of things 
because there was -- in particul -- I -- y ou 
know, it was a very key generation. People
 who were between say 18 and 22 - 25 
when the war started. [cough
s] Excuse me. S o  this lady 
heard that [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
80
and her husband that I was back and sh e as
ked me to come and visit her. It was a 
big story about you kn
ow, he hasn™t been -- he rea
lly never collaborated, he was 
called into the army and he was part of th
e -- he was -- he was not an Ustaıa, he was 
just a foot soldier and so on. But that™s 
not true because if he
 had been  he would 
have stayed and he went to Argentina 
and never came back. And I really don™t 
know why -- why th ey called me, but 
maybe -- you know, 
they knew me from 
childhood on and I felt they probably want
ed to -- they were
n™t -- were they 
apologizing? Maybe. Maybe. 
Q: Mm-hm. Mm-hm. In their gesture. 
A: In their gesture. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah.  

A: And, you know, they -- th
ey knew me from wh
en I was nine years old, so maybe 
that was -- they wanted to 
see who was a -- they were -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- maybe pleased to see that so mebod
y had surviv ed. And I never heard from 
him, but I heard via others that he was in Ar
gentina and died fairly young, as far as I 
know. The other person I visited was the mo
ther of a friend of mine who became a 
great -- he wasn™t a friend of mine, he -- he was a friend of my  brother™s, he went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
81
school with my  brother. Her -- his father 
was a -- one of the few psychiatrists in the 
country and he ran a psychiatric hospital n
ear Zagreb and then after the war he was 
accused of some malfeasance by the commu
nists and he committed suicide. That 
was a horrible story. He was comp letely
 innocent, but they  kept pushing and 
pushing and finally -- and his son was a 
very, very prominent newspaperman in 
Belgrade later on. He™s a friend of ours. 
And th is lady heard that I was in Zagreb  
and insisted that I come and see her, which I di
d. And this -- this is a si -- this is one 
of those things that I never will get over 
with, how are you -- how are you, and you 
know, about the son, who at that time was 
in Belgrade,married 
for the second time. 
And by the way, we were friends in Mexico
, he -- he ba -- he 
ba [indecipherable] 
the corresponding [indeciphera
ble] in Mexico. The lady 
-- I-I walk in and she™s oh, 
how nice to see you, keeps looking at my  cl
othes, and this, that and the other, and 
says, you know, I remember exactly what
 you wore to the opera and tel -- to 
Pacival. And describes this dress to me, I 
had completely forgotten. I mean, here her 
son had gone through par
tisanship, her husband was 
-- committed suicide because 
of -- because of pressures. Her life is 
nothing. By the way, 
one son is a very 
prominen t physician somewhere in -- in 
-- I don™t know, in the -- in the s -- you 
know, the United States, in -- in the middl
e west, I believe. And she™s describing 
my -- the dress I wore, for Pete™s sakes. 
You know, wha-what re
main -- what goes 
on in  people™s minds? I couldn™t te -- I don™
t know, maybe this is some kind of a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
82
defense mechanism because th -- fa -- you 
know, I rememb ered even tually, I mean, 
this was -- as it was I hated all of this ge
tting dressed and dressed up and so on, and 
I hated it. But apparently this was what you did, so -- 
Q: Hm. Hm. 
A: And why was I forced to si-sit through 
Pacival at age maybe 17 or 18, whatever, 
I can™t imagine either. 

Q: You mentioned that your father wa
s friends with a famous sculptor, Au-
Augustin
i
. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And that Augustin
i
 was close with Tito in the mountains. 
A: Very close. 
Q: Did your father
 ever meet Tito? 
A: No. 
Q: No. Did you? 

A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: Yes, I did. 

Q: You did? 
A: Yes, I did. He came on a state visit 
to Mexico and I met him there and I met 
Jovanka there and it was -- I was actually 
-- and you know, he 
was a big hunter and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
83
he was really a tough person. But I saw so
mething that was extremely interesting at 
the time. T h ey put up a bullf
ight for Tito. Tito was a very good shot and a very  
good hunter and so on. And in fact there 
was a lot of stuff go -- you know, that -- 
there™s -- th ere was a -- a state owned -- la
rge estate where there were -- there -- 
there were -- I don™t ev en know what -- or
 how I would go th -- I -- I think there 
were -- an agricultural estate called Bain
ya, and th ey had [indecipherable] went 
there for a hunting, and he 
did too, and he killed a bunc
h of things, and there were 
remarks about how this was brought there fo
r him to be able to cab -- it™s not true, 
he was a good shot, and a good hunter, anyhow
. But he went to this -- I saw this -- 
to this bullfight in Mexico, and there wa
s a very unusual incident where the bull 
jump ed and got caught, you 
know, where this -- this b
lind where the -- where -- 
where -- where the bullfighter hides? 
Q: Comes out? Yes, mm-hm, there™s like a wall. 

A: It™s like a wall. 

Q: And he can hide behind it. 
A: Yes. Well, this bull got caught between 
the wall and was sort of straddling th is 
and -- and he -- Tito walked aw
ay, he couldn™t look at that. 
Q: Hm. 
A: I mean, I wasn™t that close to him to 
have -- to have known the remarks, but I 
was told later on by the ambassad o r, who was a very nice Macedonian, at the time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
84
married to a Viennese woman, and also th
is person th at I just mentioned befo re, 
who became a well-known Ameri
can jour -- I mean, Yugoslav journalist, that -- that 
he got so shocked by th
e brutality of it, he collected himself and left. 
Q: Hm, that™s interesting. 
A: It was very unusual to me, I w as --  
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- I was, you know, this happens. 

Q: Yeah. And he was there 
for a bullfight, after all. 
A: He was there for a bullfight. 

Q: Yeah. Huh. 

A: That was a a very st
range thing, I mean -- 
Q: So you met him at that time? 

A: I met him at that -- 

Q: You said hello? 

A: -- at that -- some kind of a reception -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- that the ma -- the Me
xican govern ment gave and --
 and Jovanka was there and 
this was a very sad thing because Am
bassador Vlahov™s wife, who was this 
Viennese lady -- it™s a funny combination of th-the Macedonian and the -- and th e 

Viennese. She had a hard time ad  -- adjus
ting to Mexico, I remember very well. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
85
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: She developed th at week, a terrible urin
ary tract infection, 
and she had to go by 
car with Jovanka. The men went fr -- went
 -- I don™t know whet
her they went by 
plane or whether they went
 by a special [indecipherable] group, but she was 
attached up to Mrs. Tito. And th ey stoppe
d halfway, I think maybe even overn ight, 
I™m not sure, in a town between Mexico 
and Acapulco. And, 
poor woman, not only 
did this happen to her, but then  they  were
 presented by the governor of this state 
with a beautiful carved box. And in  the box
 was a very fine rebosa. But it was such 
a fine silk rebosa that it was -- it was fold
ed into this box, wh
ich I saw, which was 
no bigger than this. 
Q: Say what that is. 
A: A rebosa is one of those shawls that Mexican women wear. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But there are -- of course there are plai
n ones that are used every day and th is 
was a super gala one, but it was Mexican, it was not liba -- I™m not quite sure. This 
was a -- a specific place where this came 
from, a very famous, very beautiful, 
terribly thin. Almost like -- like -- like an 
Indian shawl, it was.
 I mean Indian from 
India. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
86
A: And Mrs. Vlohov, th e ambassador™s wife 
goes to pick up hers
, luckily it was she 
and not Jovanka, and she gets bitte
n by a scorpion. Oh my. So -- 
Q: Poor thing. 
A: -- it was not only  poor th ing w
ith this urinary tract infection -- 
Q: And she™s trying to entertain -- 
A: -- and -- and she™s trying to -- 

Q: -- as the head of state. 

A: -- entertain that s -- head of s -- I mean, 
th is -- this was really 
awful. So then they 
went -- finally then went to -- then there 
was a huge state reception, with lots of 
mu sic and lots of singing and he -- Tito 
didn™t like -- there was a -- there™s a very 
famous Mexican female singer of folk song
s and there™s a song called Cu  cu ru cu 
cu Paloma. 

Q: I know that song. 

A: Okay. There™s a great deal of Cu cu ru 
cu cu Paloma going on
 and Tito liked that 
very well, and there were a lot of speeches 
and so on, so okay, we were all part of 
this business, not because, you know, Lu
cie Rosenberg of Yu goslavia, but because 
of Morris Rosenberg, 
the [indecipherable]  
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: So -- or maybe not. Maybe a little bit of
 both, because we were -- we were fairly 
close with the Mahoffs, and 
they  lived very near us. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
87
Q: Mm-hm. Lucie, would yo
u have considered  yourself 
a Tito supporter at that 
time? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm, yeah. I mean, at the beginning -- at -- at -- at-at th at time it w as 

starting to look a little less terrific, but I 
-- we all knew what was going on, more or 
less.  

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But maybe by that time no longer. Bu
t I -- we™re -- who were you looking for? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: There was nobody on th e horizon. You 
could get some very unpleasant Serb 
nationalists or very unpleas
ant Croatian nationalists. And were very few moderates 
that you could even  think ab out. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. So you™re in Mexico in
 the -- this is the early 60™s. 
A: Early 60™s. I think 
we got there in ™61. 
Q: Right. And -- and wh ere would -- where did you go after that? 

A: We went to Paris in ™66. 

Q: Mm-hm.  
A: And stayed til ™77. 
Q: Oh my. 11 years. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
88
A: All together. No, but we re
turned to Mexico -- no, we 
returned to Mexico in ™77 
and then ™77 to ™79 we were in Mexico again. 
Q: But those were pretty volatile years in Paris. 

A: They were very volatile. We w ere there 
during the ™68 revoluti
on. It was terribly 
exciting. My  older daughter got -- well, 
I think Mary got gasse
d, too, coming from 
school. Jane was in -- during th is year ab
road, doing the [indeci
pherable] Française. 
It™s the year abroad
. This was called, yeah, it was ca
lled the year abro ad, but what 
was it? Sen -- not senior, was it fa -- it was 
a particular year abroad that universities 
counted actually as a -- as a 
class -- as -- as a -- you 
-- you got credit for it. And it 
was -- she stayed -- I mean, 
she lived at home, but she 
went to the Sorbonne and 
various other places for classes, F rench 
classes and I hardly saw Morris at all 
because he was [indeciphera
ble]. For awhile my father was with us, too.  
Q: What was Morris covering at that time? 

A: He was covering that and then the -- 
the -- and -- and the P
eace talks, the -- the 
Vietnam Peace talks were on -- 
Q: In Paris. Mm-hm. 
A: -- at the same time in Pari
s. But he was bureau chief.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So he was bureau chief for all of Fran
cophone Africa and from -- for France and 
Belgium and Switzerland. So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
89
Q: Wow. 
A: I mean, the Francophone part. And I 
was unfortunate -- I don™t know wh ether I 
should say unfortunately -- yes, unfortunate
ly, I was the bureau chief™s wife an d we 
had V.I.P.s coming in from all of Latin Am
erica, from th e States an d so on and I 
was the taker around and [indecipherable] th
e old-fashioned show, six times of the 
same show. And taking people
 shopping and all sorts of unpleasant things like that, 
it went on fo rever, and everything I don™t 
want to have. I was happy wh en I could 
sit at home and have a meal to -- by my
self with the kids, it was very, very 
demanding. After awhile I got a little tired of
 all of that and I took an -- it -- I -- I -- 

I took several courses. I too -- first I took a 
course at the -- at -- in anthropology, but 
what kind of anthropology
? I did one with Lévi-Strau
ss who was doing stuff about 
that time at the -- oh, what is it called, that
 -- they call it the [indecipherable] which 
was you didn™t get any kind of 
degrees or any kind of a
nything for it, but you sat 

there and this was anthropol
ogy and what this was most
l y  on was -- was northwest 
Canadian Indian s, and was wonderful, ab
out the Inuits, and I had always been  
interested in that. It was a super class, 
except in a -- when you 
think how classes are 
taught nowadays and the way th is wa
s taught it was just incredible. Thank 
[indecipherable] was -- the buildin
g was, I don™t know, probably 17
th
 century and 
nothing functioned at all. We started ou
t by seeing nobody is permitted to use any 

kind of -- of recording device and someone
 actually went around to  see what was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
90
going on. Then, as it was open an d free, all 
sorts of hobos would co me in and just 
sleep in the back there, b
ecause -- because you know, it 
was free, it was warm. And 
then they  had strange old wi
ndows that they always had problems getting th e blinds 
down  and he had a assistant and they woul
d do projections on the screen. And they 
were invariably upside down. I mean, I do
n™t know one time when
 this was straight. 
I mean, this is the leading an
thropologist at that time, 
Claude Lévi-Strauss and it w -
- it w -- had a -- can™t remember exactly ho
w long the course started , who -- I was 
terribly interested in the ma
terial, I actually had Morris 
take me to -- to where -- 
where this was take -- taking place. I me
an, where these Indians were, and so on 
that™s [indecipherable] 
Q: The northwest. 
A: -- Canadian me -- C anadian northwes
t was fairly fantastic. I was doing that. 
Then  I took a course that was being given 
by an -- that was some kind of branch of -
- I don™t wh ether it was NYU, I™m not quite sure -- that was given by th e very 
famous, and this is shameful 
on me, cultural an
thropologist.  
Q: Lewis? Lewis? 

A: It™s American, I should know it.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: Shame on me. He did a wonderful thin
g on five Mexican families or maybe three 
Mexican families at this point. I took that 
with a friend of mine. Then I decided to

91
do a class to teach -- to teach French. An
d this was mostly given by fre -- four 
French secondary school teachers from 
Les Colonie deut la mer. Colonies from 
across th -- I mean, from the other side 
-- from across th e oceans, let™s say. And 
they consisted fi -- of a number of high 
school teachers from Martinique, from very 
-- from African high schools and so on. An
d you know, their -- 
their curriculum is 
exactly, exactly the same in all of those countries as it 
is in France, and you can 
count on it that on the same day the same 
thing, I -- I think it™s still that way. The 
same thing is being taught in -- in -- in  Guadalupe, and who knows where in Africa, 
as it is in France. And the beginning of 
these classes when th
 -- st -- I mean the 
history classes, the history books star
t out by [indecipherable] our ancestors 
[indecipherable]. And I mean, you see these 
black ladies teaching this to these black 
children over there, it™s quite
 funny. But it™s a very rigorous program and -- and this 
was taught as the special sk -- a sp ecial 
course for -- I guess maybe they got a little 
more money for th -- from -- from the Ministry
 of Education, and they  came for this 
specialization in  English. And it was -- this
 was really fun, and I actually got a -- a 
certificate of that. It was super. 
Q: Did you end up teaching?  

A: I taught, but priv ately. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
92
A: Not -- not -- no. By that time the problem became that if you were not European , 
and the union ju st started, 
if you were English you c
ould get permission to teach, 
but not in -- in big schools. 
I mean, in actual classes.  
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Was there 
much -- you™re in Europe 
now in the -- in the 70™s. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: At this time -- in the late 70™s in the 
Un ited States anyway  was kind of a -- in the 
very late 70™s there was a 
kind of a -- a reawakening -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- in this country about the Holo caust.
 It was -- you know, there started to be 
television programs. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Among that young generatio
n -- I know I was in college at that time, a lot of my 
Jewish friends were learning abou
t the Holocaust fo
r the first time. 
A: It™s amazing to me. 
Q: There had been, you 
know, 25 years there -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- when it wasn™t mu
ch discussed publicly. 
A: That™s true. 
Q: Even the most learned academics weren ™t always given a -- a -- a warm 
reception in many places in this country. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
93
A: Right, right. 
Q: People who were studying the -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- the Holocaust. What wa
s the situation where you we
re? I mean, it was a much 
different cultural environment there, and -- 

A: In -- in -- in France, there were two 
wonderful little museums. It -- in -- one was 
in a townhouse, really touchi
ng. Little bits and pieces of artifacts. A book. I don™t 

think there was an entrance fee, but -- 
but one was expected. A few notebooks, a 
few photographs, a few books, this, that a
nd the other. Than there was an extremely 
interesting -- 

Q: You mean memorabilia from 
the Jewish community there. 
A: Ah -- y-yes. 

Q: Is that what it was? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: We did go. The Marais at th
at time was an  actual Jewish district in Paris. And I -
- I don™t like the idea of -- of saying it was a -- it was a ghetto, it was not a ghetto. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But there was a wonderful Jewish delicat
essen, so that was the only place where 
you could get rye bread. And we would go 
get rye bread and pickles and stuff like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
94
that every once in awhile. A
nd in the back of these vari
ous medieval houses were 
Jewish butch ers and people were going around 
with -- with -- in -- in sort of Jewish 
garb, with  hats on an d so on. And the fam
ous one is this golden bird where there 
was [indecipherable]. By this
 time we were already in the States, but sa -- it w as 
bombed one day, and I don™t 
know who was hurt, but there were a few people hurt 
and it was very bad. 

Q: Hm. A terrorist kind of thing? 

A: A terrorist type of thing. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Meanwhile, this was becoming terribly ge
ntrified. Mary actually did a paper on 
it that™s quite interestin g in somewhere th
at she -- probably in the 70™s, I remember. 
I don™t know what she used it for but it wa
s a paper she had to do. And people were 
buying a -- these houses and renovating 
them, the apartments. There were some 
absolutely wonderful,
 wonderful palaces there from 
early French  history. Bu t I 
mean, super-elegant places. One of them 
has since become the Jew ish museum to 
which I had never -- ha
ve never been. And the place is to
tally gentrified and I just -- 
well, when I saw it I w as quite shocked. 
There™s a nice Pica
sso muse um there. 
There was a wonderful museum wh
ich is still there in -- in the same way as it was, 
of the city of Paris which -- with, you know
, signs, butcher stores and so  on, various 
guilds and everything. Beautifu
lly done. That -- that™s still 
there. But they now have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
95
all kinds of super luxury stores and this
 is a medieval, you know, district. And I -- 
just as I said I saw a story 
where people abso lutely shocke
d and horrified and as I st 
-- as they started buying up
 these -- these places and turning th em into condos and 
turning in -- into fancy s 
-- modern stores, these peopl
e were being pushed out. So 
you saw much less of that in -- in Paris. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm -hm. And wh at about 
a -- were you memb ers of a Jewish 
community there? 

A: No. 
Q: No. Because you just neve
r got around to it, or you di
dn™t want to be, or there 
wasn™t -- 
A: I really didn™t want to be because 
you know, I had very 
little in common with 
French people, that experien
ce wasn™t the same. They™re 
very exclusive. The French 
are very exclusive people whether -- whethe
r they™re Jewish or not. We knew of a 
couple of Jewish families. One of them wa
s a family that Morri
s had met, a French 
family who had interests in north Africa a
nd he knew them from 
Algiers, I believe. 
They  were very upper upper 
middle class. Nice people, that died since, both of 
them. And -- I-I -- I™m trying to think. Ye
s, my -- one of -- I found out that for 
instance, our physician who we got by 
recommendation of somebody was -- I think 
he was a Moroccan Jew. My ophthalmologist was a woman 
and from what I can see 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
96
her name is something something bennyshu,
 I think sh e was probably Algerian or 
Moroccan Jew, so-somebody lik
e that, so some part of that part of the world. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But really not. We -- we -- we were not members of the -- 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- of the Jewish community. 

Q: Mm-hm. And did the war -- did Wo rld Wa
r II seem closer in time to you there 
than it did -- 
A: Yes -- 
Q: -- when you were here -- 

A: -- much closer.  
Q: -- in eastern --  
A: Much closer -- 

Q: -- in the States -- 

A: -- much closer. 
Q: -- or Mexico, yeah. 
A: First of all, I would go to -- to -- t-to
 Yugoslavia, I mean, you™d hop on th e train 
and you were there, there was no proble
m. Also, I had a very good friend from 
Yugoslavia, an interesting th
ing, from Zagreb, she used to
 be practically a beauty 
queen , and she was from a mixed marriage.
 And I don™t know ex actly when  she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
97
came to Paris, but she did and she -- her name was Baccichin, but I don™t know 
whether this was a -- a name that had been
 ch anged at one time or another, but she 
is a hugely tall blonde woma -- 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Lucie Rosenb
erg. This is tape number three, side B. She was? 
A: She was from Zagreb. She was -- I knew 
her family pre-war, my father -- she 
was that much older that she 
wasn™t a friend of mine in Za
greb, she™s just a --  well, 
she was ma ybe three years older, maybe ev
en four, and she was th -- one of the 
glamour girls. And she was work ing -- this
 is another interesting thing -- she was 
work ing for a manufacturer, clothing manufa
cturer who produced
 knock-offs of 
Chan el clothes. And she wo
uld buy the ma-material and 
she would, you know, get 
this kind of extra trimming on it and that ki
nd of short or long or whatever it was. 
Beautiful stuff. This was then sent -- this
 -- th ey had lots of American buyers, 
among others, for Sachs Fifth Avenue, wh ere th
e -- at that time the things were sold 
for 700 - 900 bucks, stuff lik
e that. And they were produ
ced in one of -- were in -- 
in where I saw the workshop in 
-- in the center of Paris, but not in a -- some kind of 
elegant district. How this was done was 
incredible. They would bring -- she would 
go ev ery once in awhile to Yugoslavia and 
she would recruit one or two tailors and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
98
they would bring half the village along. No
w this was -- they we
re all working, you 
know, illegally, and every so often the f 
-- the -- the -- the Fr
ench government 
would -- would simp ly raid these places, 
and they would go -- they  would go back. 
And then after awhile another village  
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- yeah. They  were somewh
ere, they were actually lik
e sweatshops, I think, they 
were put up in -- and yet they were very 
anxious to come. This was beautiful stuff, 
you know, silk lined with -- 
fantastically finished and so
 on. I mean, I can™t imagine 
that there were that many 
wonderful Serbian tailors, mo
st of them were Serbs. 
Whole villages would come, and in connectio
n with this there was a very funny -- 
funny, sad incident, what can I say? Ther
e were very many Roma
 at the time, many 
Gypsies in -- in Paris, and they  had an ex
tremely bad reputation because what really 
happened  was a number of Yu goslav or othe
r Gypsies la -- ended up in  Ro me or in 
Italy, and they -- they  were trained by 
-- I gu -- guys who turn ed them into, you 
know, pickpockets and this, that and the ot
her. They lived at the end of the town 
and they really were pretty obvious ev
erywhere, on every street. And wi -- the 
French police is not terribly kind so  they
, you know, everybody 
felt sorry for them 
until they were -- somebody stole somethi
ng from them, lots of kids that were 
pulling at your clothes and so on, and they
 was -- actually trained to do it. They 
would be in Italy and that -- they -- obviou
sly it was so e asy to
 get somebody on a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
99
train, either from Yugoslavia or Italy or 
whatever and they™d 
end up in -- in Paris 
and they  were on the streets and they sl
ept anywhere, you know
, like that. And one 
day, very close to my  house is this pers
on, this Roma woman with a small child in 
her arms, and sh e hands me a piece of pa
per written on the letterhead of a convent 
on th e outskirts of Paris, saying so and so
 has been -- has a very sick husband, or 
has been abandoned by -- by her -- by her hu
sband and we beg of 
you, whoever sees 
this to please help her and so on. This 
was -- you know, a little 
suspicious, anyhow, 
looking, although th e tone was right and th
e -- this was tha -- so
 I read this in 
French and she says the husband -- that
 she came, that she was a refugee from 
Yugoslavia and so on. But 
I read that, I start talki
ng Croatian to her, and she 
practically faints on the street. And I said
, look, I™m not going to give you any kind 
of money, I don™t like the way th is is going on, I mean, normally I would, but I 
really felt b adly about this whole thing. So 
-- as this was just ac
ross the street from 
my  house, I went and I got her clothes fo
r her, I got masses of food, I -- you know, 
thank you, thank you very much
, this is fine. So then 
two weeks later I get a call 
from my friend whose husband was, I thi
nk the ABC or CBS co
rrespondent, guy by 
the name of Bernard Redmont, who lived at 
another part of Paris, totally different. 
And h-he -- they -- you know, they were -- 
Redmont was in a very
 bad situation and 
actually had to leave the -- the States be
cause he was implicated -- I don™t know 
whether implicated, but he wa
s in those McCarthy trials -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
100
Q: Mm-hm, in the 50™s. 
A: -- in the 50™s and they left and they lived
 in France, and so  on
. And we were very 
good friends with both
 of them, they™re in Boston now. 
In fact, he was -- he was the 
dean of the journalism school, and -- at B.U.
 for awhile. So Joan
, who is the naïveté 
personified and very kind says
 to me, Lucie, there i -- th
ere™s a comp atriot of yours 
on my  doorst -- and I said yeah. Sh e [inde
cipherable] her husband, and she read s me 
this letter from a French nun. 
I se -- I said, this is very nice, give her whatever you 
want. She was inviting her in. Then anothe
r day this same friend calls me and she 
said she had a wonderful bargain. There 
was three ladies, Romas, but they were 
called Gypsies at that time 
still, who had come from C
zechoslovakia and they had 
these most wonderful s
ilks. Joan had -- used to have 
her clothes made still, and she 
bought these I don™t know how many cu ts fo
r suits and dresses and so on, all of 
which, you know, had been sm
uggled in to  -- it™s fine, I don™t care, it™s just not a 
problem for me. But this -- th
i-this she was - - she was 
very naïve about stuff like 
that. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: So the -- this was still around there. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: Listen, stop we -- stop me wh en I start digressing like that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
101
Q: Okay. No more talking about Paris and 
those days. So you were in Paris until -- I 
see by your notes -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: You were in until -- you went back to Mexico -- 
A: We went back to Mexico -- 
Q: -- in the late 70™s. 

A: In ™77, yes. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And this was the time wh
en Morris was named, very [indecipherable] Director 
General, or -- for Latin America, for the AP. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Which meant that he was 
supposed  to run the Mexico 
City bureau, mo re or less. 
It was a lot of work. And 
travel a great deal to -- 
Q: Still reporting? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: If he had -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, if he had -- it had been all at 
-- you -- you always report when you™re with 
the AP whether you do or not, but I mean, 
if there had been anything very important 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
102
he would have. But collecting money and 
doing all sorts of -- you know, wo rk like 
that, meetin g with publis
hers, getting new co ntracts, that kind of stuff. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So you
 were back in Mexico. 
A: So I was back in Mexico. By that tim
e my granddaughter wa
s born, they came to 
visit. Mary was still in school, I guess, I me
an at -- at Yale, and we still had a lot of 
good friends in Mexico at 
the time. One of my very intimate friends was a woman 
from Zagreb who -- who is a refugee. She 
had gone again, via Italy to Cuba, to 
Mexico. And her husband, 
her ex-husband had been in  the watch business in 
Yugoslavia. And she had opened
 a boutique for women™s cl
othes, and had stayed in 
Mexico, she™s still there. She™s a few year
s older than I am. Her name is Sophia 
Condon. And she got divorced from her Yu
goslav husband and I think he died  just 
very recently in Geneva. Remarried, and 
I saw her pretty mu
ch daily, because -- 
well maybe not daily, but certainly twice a week, maybe twice a week, yeah. 
Q: So with -- you went back and you -- ju
st the two of you then, your girls were 
both -- one was married -- 
A: One was married with
 a small child and -- 
Q: -- and one was in college. 
A: -- one was in college, yeah. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
103
A: The person who was with us was Celia
 Sadna, who was the housekeeper who™d 
been with us since th
e children were very small, and 
she went to Paris with us, she 
was with us all this time and 
she came to Mexico with us. 
Q: Hm. She Yugoslav? 
A: Basque. 
Q: Basque? 

A: Basque. 

Q: Uh-huh. Celia, I thought maybe -- 
A: No. 
Q: Huh. Interesting. 

A: Basque. 
Q: It™s so interesting to me to hear you 
-- to put together this
 picture that from the 
time you left Zagreb, you lived  in so ma
ny different places, but you kept your 
connections. And I -- and your
 identity as a Yugoslav -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- all throughout that time -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- which so many people did not do. And, you know, people -- others -- 
Holocaust survivors that I™ve 
talked to, they -- 
they didn™t mo re around as mu ch as 
you did. And you al
so were brought up in kind 
of a cosmopolitan atmosphere. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
104
A: Yes. 
Q: So th at was some -- second nature 
to you in a way to
 be moving around. 
A: That™s true too, but I -- there was anot her great plus and th at was that Morris was 
connected to Yugoslavia. He
 had been there during Worl
d War II. He opened the -- 
what was known as the American library 
in Belgrade and in  Zagreb and he had 

many Yu goslav friends. Very many. And th at 
was part of it. He was interested in 
that culture. He -- he was very fond of -- 
of -- of these Yugslav th at he had met. 
And he never really learned to sp eak, but 
he understands quite well and h-he -- h-he 
can get along there. Not grammatically very caref -- ver-ver-very, let™s say 
correctly, but he can make himself understood. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And he™s very attach
ed to the whole place. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It™s a strange thing, isn™t it? 

Q: That™s nice for you, yeah. 
A: Yeah, yeah. So it wasn™t, you know, 
keep  away from these old stories.  
Q: Right, right. So it never really 
disappeared from your life, that -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- that world. 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
105
Q: You were in touc
h with it all along. 
A: No. And there are people, including my
 cou -- my cousin, who thinks that I™m 
too heavily immersed 
in it. And for awhile, you know
, there are -- there are periods 
when -- I mean, obviously I™ll visit my frie
nds that I was in touch with and wh om I 
called in Zagreb, and some were schoolmate
s and some were friends and so on. But 
I never, never lost th -- and my  cousin  says
 that I™m over involv
ed. And I think I got 
specially involved when  I starte
d work ing in the mu seum -- 
Q: Sure. 
A: -- because all of the stuff started sort 
of floating to the surface, and -- and -- and I 
felt as long as I can contribute at least th
e language and some 
background to this, 
that I wanted to. And that™s
 when I started reading more
 and more of the stuff, and 
that™s -- I won™t say I speak contemporary 
Croatian. I mean, I -- I do, but they -- 
they™v e been  changing things around unnece
ssarily lately , I mean they -- there™s a 
very interesting book that Morris just read
, a-about the manipulation of language in 
Yugoslavia, and -- as politics. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: They suddenly, fo r instan ce in -- in -- in -- during 
the Ustaıa regime and then 
during Tudjman, they were inventing word
s from that yid -- not ev en inventing, 
let™s say adapting medieval words to the 
m-modern  language, so you know, this -- 
this was a forced thing -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
106
Q: To make a political point -- 
A: -- to make a political point. 
Q: And the point was -- 

A: And the point was -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- we have a thousand now. 

Q: Now. 

A: Now. Croats have a very exclusive cu
lture that goes back [speaks Croatian here] 
a thousand years culture, and -- wh ich was to
 say, you know, forg et the others, we 

had it. That is [indecipherable] in a way. Or
 -- or -- or as a cousin of mine, as an 

uncle of mine once said, wh at are you ta
lking about? Everybo
dy had an ancestor, 
you kn -- wh en somebody was bragging ab out 
something like that. But there is a di 
-- th-there -- there is ag ain -- they™re co
ming back to this, I mean, after Tudjman 
immediately there was -- there was a little b
it of a -- of a lull, but they™re doing it 

again. They™re -- they™re -- they™re inve
nting word s, ad -- you know, adapting 
medieval words to th e modern language. 

Q: Mm. Let me -- let™s talk about how you 
-- you came back to Wash ington in 1979 
I see? 
A: Right. 
Q: And you™ve been here ever since? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
107
A: I™ve been here ever since.  
Q: At that time, 1979 - 1980, as I mentione
d before, there was this very, you know, 
what I call a reawakening of -- 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- growth , of interest and knowledge 
about the Ho locaust in this country  -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- among Americans. 

A: Yes. 
Q: And did you -- di
d you notice that? 
A: Yes, yes. In fact, I was at some so
rt of meeting when it was -- when -- when 
there were -- was talk of w
ill this Holocaust museum be 
built or not. Elie Wiesel 
spoke. I didn™t know whethe
r I liked the idea or not. I think th ere probably was 
something in me still that 
said low profile is better. 
Q: As a Jew? 

A: As a Jew. 
Q: Self defense, then. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Instinct. 
A: Yes, yes. Is it necessary to put up a 
huge museum like that? Hoo, you know, we 
all know wh at it is, let™s write books abou t it. Is this necessary? I think it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
108
extremely necessary. I think it™s very good. 
It™s very good not 
-- not so much the 
presence, but the -- the schol
arship that™s going on, which would not exist without 
it. I mean, there would be 
people doing little bits and 
pieces without rhyme or 
reason, I th -- I™m no -- rhyme or reason is
 not the word , but I mean it would be -- 
Q: Without focus, wi -- yeah. 
A: -- without focus. I think it™s extremely important. And I d -- I didn™t think so  at 

the beginning, but I think it™s re
ally evolved very beautifully. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yeah, that -- that -- 
Q: So at wh at point did -- do you reme mb
er when  the mu seum opened? Did you -- 
A: I reme mber when  the mu seum opened. Yes,
 very soon afterwards, I went to -- to 
-- to see it. I went with my cousin and 
I rememb er using the computers upstairs and 
I mean, whatever it was that we -- we dr
edged up, Jasenovac, which I believe was 
either misspelled or something was wrong, 
and we were kind of put off. And then I 
went, obviously through them
 -- through the permanent e
xhibit and ev erything else, 
and it was horrifying. I was also, at that tim
e very much upset that there was hardly 
anything on Yugoslavia, very
 little. But then, it 
really isn™t surprising because, you 
know, how many Yugoslav Jews, or how 
many Yugoslavs rea
lly survived who 
went through it, and there was very little le
ft. Now, I did not mention that at the 
very beginning, wh en -- when Yugoslav Je
ws started coming to New York er -- in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
109
the 40™s, they bought a plot in
 the -- in -- in -- in New Je
rsey where they formed a ci 
-- a cemetery, which is now quite full. An
d this apparently is very much what 
happens, because there were groups from 
Germany, from Austria, from who knows, 
the Bukovina and so on, who had plots of 
their own. And that™s where it is, in New 
Jersey, in fair -- fair -- Fairview mew 
-- New Jersey. And there was an association 
of Yu goslav Jews in the Un ited States, which wo rked  on A, help ing people who -- 
who were totally, you know, bereft of ever
ything and try -- got visas, worked with 

the State department, worked
 with various other govern
ments, helped with this 
restitution business that I told you about. And 
then there was this terrible incident of 

Oswego, which I don™t know whet
her you know anything about. 
Q: I don™t. 
A: Okay . It was a group of people who were
 saved in Italy, mostly Yugoslav Jews 
who were brought here. Roosevelt promised
, I don™t know, a thousand people to be 
able to come in and they 
came and they were put behi
nd barbed  wire in Oswego. 
Q: New York? 
A: New York. 
Q: Detained for what reason? 

A: They weren™t detained, they were br
ought here and -- but they were, I guess, 
enemy aliens or whatever they were, and th
ey all -- thi-this was one of the my -- one

110
of the mo st traumatic experiences of my  
life. I don™t know wh ether I spoke ab out 
that, or I ca -- 
Q: Mm-mm, mm-mm. 

A: -- not to you, but maybe in the -- 
Q: Not in the video interview. 
A: No? 

Q: No. I don™t -- I saw that -- 

A: Okay . 
Q: -- I -- I don™t remember this -- 
A: Well, this was a terrible story. One da
y we were told by Voice of America th at I 
should go with a -- w
ith a -- somebody with
 a recorder to the 
dock s in New York 
because a ship was 
arriving with -- 
Q: What year was this, roughly? 

A: ™47, maybe? ™46 - ™47 -- bringing refug
ees who were being given shelter in the 
United States and mo st of them were Yugo
slavs. So I was sent by Voice of America  
with some, as I said -- wa
s about to say cameramen. 
There were some cameramen 
as a matter of fact, too, but mo stly sound 
people. And we got ther
e and this group of 
people started coming out and they  reco
gnized  me, a bunch of them, and they  
started asking ab out my  brother, who -- so 
this was very shortly after the end of 
war, maybe the war was still on. Yeah, the 
war was still -- and -- and I had to yell 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
111
over, you know, hundreds of people to te
ll them there was no Mario any mo re. And 
then another somebody came and so on. And 
they looked like ab
solute hell. These 
were people who had been living in Ital
y and doing quite well. Had already, you 
know, gotten things from the various Jewish
 organizations and had sort of pulled 
themselves together, but here
 was the possibility of goin
g to the United States, so 
wow, great. And it was great, in the end. Bu
t they came and th ey were not allowed -
- we were behind -- we had barricades, 
this was yelling through barricades. First 
thing that happened wh en they  arrived, they
 made -- before they arrived, they made 
them give all the clothes, which these pe
ople had bought with wh atever was left 
over, let™s, you know, do a bella
 figura wh en you arrive he
re. And they were thrown 
into i -- i -- it™s -- i-it to be
 a -- deloused  and [indecipherable]. So you got rags. 
Everything lost its color. They sp rayed th
em with DDT, all these people, I don™t 
know wh ether it -- probably DD T, it was awfu
l, they were delousing them and so 
on. So th ese were people wh
o had been  living a mo re or less norma l life in Italy, 
who suddenly came. So then 
it was this big committee, th
ey took them to Oswego 
into an ex -army camp and put them behind
 wires -- I mean, behind -- behind -- I 
think there was even, if I™m not mistak
en a -- a -- you know, wire. And was a big 
scandal. And I rememb er my father, who at
 that time I think was the vice-president 
or wh atever, secretary of this association of
 Yugoslav Jews that 
were going there to 
try to calm these people down, who were
 ju -- a great ma ny were Yugoslav Jews, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
112
not all, but a great many as this -- you know, they -- they
 picked them up in Italy, 
these -- these people had already been sa
ved, I mean, you know. They were in no 
danger. And so first, you know, this -- this
 was a whole [indeciph
erable] andI don™t 
know exactly how -- well, th
ey fe -- it got to be wh ere the point where Mrs. 
Roosevelt went there to intervene a
nd one day one of these people turned  
themselves up -- turn ed up at our door, one
 of the women who knew where I was, 
about maybe two or three years younger than
 I am. Frien d  of my brothers. Suddenly 
she was at our front door in  New York  on
 Riverside Drive, and she spent the night 
we -- my father and sister, she had to 
go back because otherw
ise she would have 
been, I don™t know, I guess 
a criminal or whatever. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: And finally with -- I don™t know exactly
 how long they stay ed there -- but there 
was a film about them, about 
this ship coming over. Ma
ybe Ruth  Grube or someone 
like that worked on it and th
ey -- as I said quo -- many many of -- there -- there™s 
some of them still here, one of them is 
a woman who lives in -- in Baltimore, who -- 
who was a -- a child then, a little g irl and 
so on. I don™t remember how long it took. 
So that kind of stuff the Yu
goslav di -- association did.  
Q: And I™d -- I would think that would be 
so traumatic fo r you,
 only because here 
these were people you knew, who knew you -- 

A: Yes, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
113
Q: -- and you were on the ot
her side of the fence. 
A: Yes, completely. 
Q: Metaphorically speaking. 

A: I was, I was. 
Q: And literally. 
A: I was. 

Q: You -- you could have been th em. 

A: Oh, absolutely -- 
Q: It must have --  
A: -- absolutely. 

Q: -- mu st have been 
very clear to you -- 
A: Abso  --  

Q: -- at that point. 

A: It was. I mean, this was th-the -- th
e people who were practically -- some my  

age, some a little younger. Maybe a little you
nger than  me. I don™t know what -- I 
told you this was 
the -- my  generation that just went. 
Q: You know, since I™ve seen 
your interview, the first in
terview when you told the 
story about how your father 
got you out and -- and how he
 mu st have been planning 
this. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
114
Q: And you mu st have given a lot of tho
ught over the years to 
what a remarkable 
thing that was, and [indecipherable] -- 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- and you know, wo ndering if you woul
d have surv ived if you hadn™t got out. 
A: I knew I wouldn™t have. I -- obviously I 
was sturdier than I am now and I would 
have probab ly tried to get into the mount
ains and so on. But,
 you know, I -- I was 
well known. No-Not well, I mean this is 
ridiculous. If anybody 
had been after me, 
they would have known how to  get 
me. I mean, I -- I was not anonymous. 
Q: You would have
 been on lists. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: [indecipherable] the whole family. 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: So, how do -- after all these years, how
 do you think about 
that, how do you -- 
A: I think that my father was extremely 
determined and courag
eous, and I think of 
him, you know, as a man in the best years of
 his life, I guess, just deciding so, okay, 
wi -- nevermind, if things wo rk  out, we™ll come back. And I think th is was really 

behind his thinking most of the time. A
nd if not -- and you know, he was terribly 
hurt -- I can™t [indecipherable] I can™t descri
be the trauma of a father losing an only 
son, although I was extremely clo se to my fa
ther, it wasn™t that I felt, you know, in 
any way because I was a girl that -- that
 I counted for any less. But there da -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
115
guess there was planning what was going to be
 with -- with -- with a -- a son and so 
on.  
Q: And a business and so on. 

A: And the busin esses and so on. They  mu
st have been. And 
he was -- he never 
carried on, he -- possibly be
cause he had been  in a wa
r, possibly because so many 
of -- others of our friends on all sides were killed. I -- I d on™t know. 

Q: What do you mean he ne
ver carried on? He never -- 
A: He -- he was -- he -- he was consolin
g us. He wasn™t sitting there, you know, 
shedding tears constantly, constantly, constantly.  

Q: And not bitter? 

A: He was not bitter. 
Q: That™s pretty amazing. 
A: He was not bitter. 

Q: Given wh at he left behind. 

A: Yes. 
Q: And the life he left behind. 
A: Yes. No, I don™t think he ever really wo
rried about that too mu ch. It -- it was a -- 
you know, it was a paternalistic
 st -- society altogether, and I felt strange echoes of 
this much later. I came, for 
instance, to Belgrade and 
we saw Morris™s se cretar y, 
who was an old lady, and wh
o recently died  -- I think she may have been a hun -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
116
just under a hundred. Sh e was the oldest 
person born in Belgra
de who died. So she 
was probably 98 or so. She had been evac uated during Wo rld War I, to England. So 
anyhow, he go -- he -- Morris, 
when they opened 
this reading room there, this lady 
Vera Wynik was one of the secretaries and 
they -- she had a terrible time because of 
the communists wanted -- were -- were thre
atening her in a horrible way. They -- 
they wanted whatever secrets, there were 
no secrets, but they wanted all kinds of 
information, which she refuse
d to give. And they were 
harassing her to an awful -- 
in an awful way, and Morris -- Morris fe
lt -- heard about it la
ter, andhe didn™t 
know, I mean, she was 
about to commit suicide, and it™s a very sad story. So  he was 
very close to her and he -- he was constan
tly in  touch here and we -- she gave me 
some of those icons that were there,
 and -- so, a wonderful woman, whom we 
visited in Belgrade all -- the first time we
 went back. And she said to me, do -- I-I™m 
going back to the paternalistic
 societies that were going 
on then -- she said to me, 
you know, when  your father ca
me to visit me, he -- because my father went back to 
Yugoslavia way befo re we did an d Morris 
said, would you please 
visit Vera Wynik, 
giver her my  love, see what she 
needs and so on. Do th at. Fine.

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Lucie Ro
senberg. This is tape number four, side A. 
A: Apparently, before my father came to 
visit, they already knew -- somebody from 
the secret service came to see her and said
 -- or maybe -- maybe he had just either 
phoned her or they got toge
ther at the very beginning,
 and said I understand that 
Manfred Sternberg has come to visit 
you. What have you got with  Manfred 
Sternberg ? And apparently she said, he is 
the broth -- he is the -- the father-in-law 
of an old friend of ours and so on, who 
was so and so. They knew anyhow. And this 
ke -- person kept insisting and insisting and 
in sisting, a very high
 up person in the -- 
in -- in the Secret Service, the OZNA, wh
ich was the scary thing, I mean that was 
the secret police in spades. Turn s out that
 this was a boy who my  father had given 
scholarships to. He was -- I knew nothing about
 this, absolutely no
thing. He was the 
son of the work man in -- outside, where the 
factory was, outside Zagreb, and he was 
apparently  a talented kid, whom his parents,
 I think after, I mean, four years or fi -- 
of -- of -- or whatever it was, I think mayb
e it was six years of -- of -- of elementary 
school, pulled out of school and he woul
d have probably  been
, you know, working 
on the fi -- in the fields or whatever. And 
my father knew that this was a very smart 
kid, and he apparently  gave
 him a scholar -- gave -- gave
 the parents, I don™t know, 
the money for this kid to go -- go th rou
gh high school. And th is was then some 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
118
great big -- I mean, he went thro ugh th e pa
rtisans and so on. And he kept asking 
Vera Wynik about me, and that if ever Ica -- and the next time, when we came, he 
knew exactly when that we we
re coming and he asked Vera
 to -- for me to get in 
tou -- I -- I had no idea who this was. I me
an, when  I heard the name I knew he was 
somebody from -- from -- from the village. I 
mean, where would I be interested  for 
a little boy who was three or four years yo
unger than I was, you know? He knew 
about my  brother. He knew absolu tely ever
ything. And I found out that my  father 

had sent him through scho
ol, you know, forever. And I know we were never 
permitted to be near anything
 like that with the -- the 
-- you know, they had these 
Christmas things wh ere kids got dressed 
for winter and you kn
ow, and clothes and 
books, and this, that and the other, which 
we weren™t -- had no idea about them. We 
were totally excluded  because these were
 kids, you know, some of them were in 
school with us at the same time, some were younger. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: These were kids that I knew around. 
Q: Right. 
A: Never a word about that. So I™m saying 
this -- this paternalism h ad two sides to 
it, I guess. 
Q: Mm-hm. And he was -- he was just 
questioning her, or in
terrogating her fo r 
some -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
119
A: I thi -- she was terrified -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- because this was the secret police. 

Q: Well, but she -- 
A: Why do they know th at Manfre
d Sternberg is visiting her -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and who is this -- 

Q: But he really had -- 
A: -- and he was interrogating me, and then  
finally I met him. Finally I met him, the 
second time I came back and she was saying 
something to  me that, you know, I was 
a very young woman then. She said -- Vera 
said, you know he™s 
got some kind of a 
notion ab out you and he is su
re to be disappointed. I don
™t know whether you need 
to see him. He is not -- I don™t know, I 
guess maybe he™s still alive. He finally -- 
when I came back the first ti
me to the village, one of 
the village women told me 
that, you know so and so? He™s got a big 
estate up in -- she showed me up the road 
and that™s when I -- when 
I realized that, you know. 
Q: Yeah. What was it like -- I w ant to ask y
ou a couple things, I -- I have left here. 
What was it like for you in the early 90™s
 when  war started ag
ain in Yugoslavia, 
when  Yu goslavia started to break up?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
120
A: I was heartbroken. I thought it was terrible. First of all the violence that, you 
know, the thought that you can™t go throu
gh two generations without having a war. I 
knew it was going to be aw
ful for everybody around. 
Q: Were you surprised? You -- you coul
dn™t have been too su rprised at -- 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: No. 

Q: You™d been going back and fo rth -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and you had a sense of -- 

A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: -- the tension there afte
r Tito died, especially. 
A: Yes, yes, yes. No, I -- I wasn™t surp
rised. What I was surprised at was the 
horrible violence, all th at. 
Q: Yeah, the political breaki
ng apart wasn™t a surprise. 
A: N-No, because -- yeah, I -- I w as read
ing papers, I w -- I was in touch with 
people. Every once in awhile I would -- I 
would hear from frie
nds and th ere would 
be snide remarks, wherever
 I was there were snide 
remarks about Croats. In 
Belgrade there were more than snide rema
rks, in Zagreb  about people in Belgrade. 
Not to mention that I guess whatever wa
s a communist party that at one time may 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
121
have been very idealistic or 
certai n ly, you know, that had 
deteriorated into all sorts 
of unpleasant things. And th ere was some 
really unpleasant consumption goi -- you 
gop -- you know, there -- there was money 
being spen t on -- on -- on these huge 
hotels that were being built in -- in 
-- in -- say in Dubrovnik was importing 
bathroom fixtures instead of trying to, yo
u know, bring your own.
 I mean he -- they 
were spending millions of dinars or what
ev -- yeah, dinars by importing stuff from -
- from Italy and so on and it -- well, you coul
d see that it was going to start falling 
apart and there were constantly in
trigues left and right. It had -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: What I was doing here 
though, for awhile, was teac
hing English to various 
people wh o were going for the State depa
rtment, for the Commerce department and 
so on. No, th e Co mmerce didn™t, mo st of th
em were State department people. There 
were these various language schools, co
mme rcial language schools which had -- it 
was a [indecipherable] thing. You would be
 hired, and you woul
d go there for six 
weeks or -- or -- or three months or wh at
ever and then  somebody said you don™t 
need to come tomorrow any more. And y
ou know, I -- I could 
survive, but there 
were people who were doing th
is who could not surv ive, and they  were all over the 
place. And I taught maybe in th ree or four
 of them anywhere in Arlington, some 
were even further out. 

Q: You were teaching English? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
122
A: It was taught -- teaching English to pe
ople who were going to go for it, mostly 
the State department to Yugoslavia. And 
th ere were a couple of [indecipherable] 
Q: You were teaching it to -- English to who -- 

A: I mean I was teachi
ng Croatian to English -- 
Q: Okay , okay. 

A: -- speakers, obviously. 

Q: Right. 

A: And that was very interesting. Then 
there were a couple of women from -- and 
there the -- the Croatian Serbian, they also
 exploded very  often in  a very strange 
way, because [indecipherable] people 
who were teaching who wa -- who was 
teaching along with me was this -- they
 were teaching Croa
tian and they were 
teaching Serbian, you had both things. Ev
erybody was politically involved one way 
or another and there was a 
young Serbian priest who hara
ssed some  smar t Ame rican 
women who were working in the Defense 
department. He harassed them to the 
point where they were weeping, and -- and 
then went to  somebody and said wasn™t 
work -- couldn™t quite work ou
t what -- what I was, I mean, you™re not a Croatian, 
you™re not na -- you know, like that. And 
very unpleasant things were -- were going 
on. But for awhile I -- I didn
™t feel like, you know, both
ering with this. And then I 
worked for Voice of America again. 

Q: Oh you did? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
123
A: Yeah. 
Q: Here? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: During what years, roughly? 
A: Might be 80™s, early 80™s? Started off a 
very nice guy who became head of the -- 
when  it was still a Yugoslav desk, but then  
it became divided into Croatian, and th e 
Slovenian desk was always apart, but s
uddenly we had a -- a Croatian desk an d a 
Serbian desk and a this and a that a
nd speakers from all over. And I was doing 
translations there. No, it started out as fo
llows, one [indecipherable] this guy, this 
friend of ours had just retired and turned
 over -- he™s a Serb from Belgrade who 
Morris also gave his first job. He was 
a prisoner of war in Germany and Mo rris 
gave him a first job. And th en it turned  ou
t he was one of the best friends of my 
cousin™s husband. He -- he was, for quite
 awhile handled the Yugoslav desk. And 
he retired and th en I started work ing -- 
Q: Do you reme mb er his name? 
A: Yes, Slavko Tutorovich. He
™s alive, he™s -- he™s in 
-- here. His wife was my best 
friend for a long time here, sh
e died unfortunately of cancer and I miss her terribly. 
He -- very conservative person, but neve
rmind, was -- both of them, and now has 
turned out to be really a Serb Nationalist who -- I won™t go into that, we don™t talk 
about that because when we 
go talk about that, that™s
 the end. But -- and -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
124
there™s a lot of conspi -- conspiracy  theo
ry about America rea
lly, I mean, is in 
cahoots with everybody agains
t the Serbs. So, that™s -- I -- I -- I don™t want to -- but, 
we said, the problem is, you know, talking 
ab out something else. But he™s very nice 
otherwise. Anyhow, at first I was doing 
-- I was given the scripts and I was doing 
translations here and just turning th em ove
r to the [indecipherable] just -- I hate to 
say what kind of garb age lot -- I mean, wh
at kind of -- of -- of -- you know, waste 
of time, money, wh atev er you want, these th
ings were. It was just awful, especially 
the [indecipherable]. They™re 
filled with nothing. Like 
for instance -- trying to 
think. A feature [coughs] excuse me -- 
about that movie ﬁOld Yeller.ﬂ [coughs] 
Q: Do you want 
to get a drink? 
A: Mm-hm. [tape break]. You know, 10 mi
nute, 15 -- 10 -- 10 minute feature, I 
think. Very boring. But they were in 
Croatian and I was the Croatian voice, okay ? 
So then after awhile some of
 the women, and I think they
 -- they were right, one of 
the Serbian woman decided that my  voice 
was too old. I can™t agree more. A -- you 
-- you can tell. Although th is was maybe 10 
years ago. But yes, if you listen to it 
you can tell this is not a young person. Ok ay
, doesn ™t matter. It wasn ™t -- it wasn™t 
anything that was -- you know, about ro ck and roll. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And -- although probably 
that should have been done
. Then -- then I did a -- a -- 
a few newscasts and so on. And th en the 
whole thing started exploding and one day 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
125
the guy who -- who succeeded 
Slavka Tutoravich, who™s s
till alive now and so on, 
in fact, we™re about the same age, said 
again from one day to the next, you know we 
don™t have a budget, you 
don™t have to come tomo
rrow. Was hugely furious 
because I think I was -- you know, at leas
t should have had, 
you know, two days 
notice or something like that. 

Q: And this was during the war? 

A: This -- no, I do-don™t know -- 

Q: No? 
A: -- when, no, not necessarily. Bu
t during very  tense times, yes. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: Very, very tense times. You could tell th
at Yugoslavia was fallin g apart, and this 
was very evident on that desk
, I mean, they were in each
 other™s hair in the mo st 
awful way. Although the head
 of, I guess what™s known as
 the Yugoslav desk, is a 
woman by the name of Mya, I forget th
e surname now, who was a Croat. And she 
still is. But obviously with an
 American citizenship [indec
ipherable] and so on. So -
- 
Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to ask you al
so a little bit in more detail about your 
work  at the mu seum and when  did you -- wh
en did you start -- 
it™s volunteering that 
you were doing down there, translating and -- 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
126
Q: Tell me about how yo -- how did you ge
t involved , why did you get involved ? 
A: Well, I received one of the bulletins and I 
saw that they had a grant for a year for 
a young man -- a young schola
r, Canadian scholar who ha
d just come -- who -- who 
was just doing translations and make -- 
no, not doing translations, sorting and 
arranging and trying to get under this 
huge material that they had gotten from 
Zagreb , from the archives of Zagreb, and th is -- I don™t know exactly  how th is 
work ed, but they had sent over somebody 
who -- who had microfilmed or whatever 
all of this material which was then ther
e and it was there and nobody did anything 
with it. I don™t know how long this had 
been  going on. And this young man was in 

the process of publishing a b
ook on the Croatian peasant party, wh ich he even tually 
did in English, and was ve
ry good. I think it was very
 good. And who then went 
back for the museum, I [ind
ecipherable] but I™m no -- yeah, I guess for the museum 
to partly -- to Zagreb, three years 
ago [indecipherable] three years ago. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And was trying to get mo re stuff and 
so  on from the archives. I -- this is a 
scholar and he really doesn™t know how to
 push and penetrate. And wh en he came 
back to Zagreb the 
second time they su
ddenly, the -- the -- the [indecipherable] 
whoever was in charge of -- of -- of perm
itting you to have paper, to have -- to 
microwave, or -- not microwave, I mean -- 
Q: Microfilm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
127
A: -- micro film, or -- o r make copies or -- of
 any kind of m-ma teri
al that you found, 
only permitted them, I 
don™t know, like eight a day or something crazy like that. 
And he is a ver -- not shy, but
 he is a retiring young man, and he didn't know how to 
say listen, I am doing so  and so, this is
 the book I have writte
n now, and so on, I 
want this. He just didn™t do it. And I me
t him on a couple of occasions, I think there 
were other distractions there, but I don™t 
know what they were. And he -- he didn™t 
finish everything th at needed  to be 
done there, I don™t think, for his -- 

Q: Research. 
A: -- for hi -- for -- for -- for -- not for 
the mu seum, but for his own sake. And he 
had met both Go ldsteins, and Ivo Gold stein 
is also a historian and he told them, 
listen, you ju st simp ly have to go ther
e and -- and push and sa
y and get in touch 
with so and so. He didn't do it. He is wo
rking for the Canadian government now and 
trying to get another academic job and I hope 
he gets it. This is a nice young man 
but -- but -- but not sufficiently, let™s say a
ggressive in that way. Also, he asked me 
several times did I know Dr. Mirjana Gr
oss. A-And Mirjana Gross is my  friend 
Faya™s childhood friend. I didn™t know 
her, but I knew who she was. She is the 
professor of history and I think mo stly 18
th
 and 19
th
 cr -- century Croatian history. 
So exactly the -- the -- the -- 
that era that he was writing on and so on, and a great 
expert on the Croatian peasant party and so  on. And I got them together and I 

practically -- and Mirjana Gross had to pu
ll it out of him, she wanted a book, both 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
128
for the -- for the department -- or for the 
-- for the library, and for herself. I mean , 
he had been  asking me for -- and he kept, you know, oh, I don™t know, do I have 
enough, [indecipherable] you know, and sh  -- did -- he did. And th en she said, well 

I hope you™re going to ini -- to initiate it -- 
yeah, to -- to initial it for me and he did, 
finally. He™s just not aggre
ssive enough, but he™s a good
 scholar. He says he™s an 
excellent scholar of Croatian stuff. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

A: Anyhow, I saw that he was here and 
that the stuff was there and I called him 
because I saw he was Canadian and Ihad my doubts about cron -- Canadian 

Croatian scholars, I didn™t 
know what this was. 
Q: Can you say his name? 
A: Ah, wait a minute. This is -- really sh
ould be [indecipherab
le], I™ll get it in a 
second. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Can you -- can you -- [tape break] his book here. 
Q: Okay . 
A: His name was Mark Biondich. He™s a 
very talented young man and did really 
excellent scholarly work
 on the -- on -- on this particular part of Croatian history. 
And he was a scholar in residence for a year 
there, and -- although this -- this really 
wasn™t -- wasn™t his -- his -- his -- let™s sa
y his branch of -- he knew very little ab out 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
129
Jewish history. He knew a lot about -- about 
what the Ustaıa did and so on, that he 
was well informed. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But on th e other hand, he coul
dn™t put a face to any of that. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And he and I together went through 
these documents, through these microfiches 
and ran into absolutely the most unbelieva
ble stuff. I mean the -- whole classes of 
people I knew and friends and schoolmates 
of my  brother™s. And people -- I mean, 
the most unbelievable things. This 
was done mostly alphabetically. 
Q: These were records of Jews
 that had been  rounded up? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Were killed. And in connection with
 this, for instance, later on, we -- 
[indecipherable] who was work
ing on the project kept getting these -- these requests 
from people to see whether 
they knew wh at happened to  their brothers, to their 
parents and so on. And we got a request 
from a woman in California looking for her 
father and her uncles and so
 on. And we immediately fo
und the various uncles and 
so on. And then we fo und her name listed as
 perished at the [indecipherable] place, 
which we sent her. 

Q: Wow. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
130
A: [indecipherable] person. And sh e had been
 -- she had come to Austria, sh -- her 
mo ther had smuggled her out with the help  
of a German officer and so on. I mean, 
she was -- she came fin ally to the museum a
nd it was -- she gave all sorts of mater -
- of pictures and so on and so fo rth. Sh
e grew  up in Vienna without knowing what 
her background was, although her mo ther
 was there and she went through -- she 
was in a Catholic school and sh e we
nt thro ugh co mmunion and everything. 
Q: Yeah. It must have been -- 
A: The mother recently died. 
Q: Oh. It must have been 
quite a bittersweet k ind of 
experience for you to go 
through this material -- 
A: Yes, it was, yes it was. 
Q: -- to relive those days. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And yet, to be able to contribute something. 

A: It was extremely -- I really, I tell you, h onored is not quite the wo rd to  say, but I 
felt it was -- I could contribute some way. I mean, there are not that many Serbo -- 
Serbo-Croat speakers in -- in -- who have th
e time to do it in -- in
 Washington. So I 
was extremely happy. And of co urse, the ma te
rial had just arrived. I mean, this -- 
not just arrived, just been so
rted out up to a certain point. 
Q: And for you persona
lly too, I would think it filled in a picture -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
131
A: Oh [indecipherable] 
Q: -- you know, around the edges, that -- 
A: -- extremely so. There were a number of 
things that I didn™t know about. I also 
found, through some of the recordings, wh
ich I don™t know who paid for, I believe 
the museum must have paid for it -- for 
this. There were some
 eyewitness stori es 
and so on done by a guy w
ho lives in London who™s a Sephard ic Jew. And I can™t 
reme mb er his name right now, but he did 
it for the museum. And he told the story 
of a young man who was my  boyfriend, so to
 speak. I me an, he -- he wasn™t, but he 
was, okay [indecipherable] a very nice 
young man who was a law student, who 
perished in the most
 incredible, dreadful, complic
ated way that one can only 
imagine. He was a law student, he had be
en in  the Yugoslav army , yo- you know, 
you had to do your year. So
metimes it was postponed by a year if you happened to 
be a student, but no, in fact, when we left
 he had just finished his one year, he -- 
swaggering around in  a very elegant unifo
rm, with boots and so on. Very, very  
good looking. And -- although, I really wa 
-- you know, he was decorative, I wasn™t 
in love or anything like that, but maybe he
 was, I really don™t know. I don™t know, 

but you know, he -- we went 
out a few -- we went out, you know, f -- we went out 
from here to there together. It™s th e goi
ng out that was going on and -- and he 
accompanied me under the guidance of every
body else to balls and there™s a th ing 
when you were 18. Until you were 18 you
 didn™t count as a human being. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
132
when  you were 18 you went to the journa
lists ball, and then you were launched. 
[indecipherable] 
Q: Yeah, you mentioned that in your 
other interview, then you hated that. 
A: -- it™s a parade, oh, I hated that. Abso
lutely hated it. But anyhow, he -- this 
young man was a law student, just finishin
g, I guess, not even that. And he was 
caught with the first group of
 people, the first group of 
young Jewish -- and then I 
guess wh atever pro [indecipherable] boys wh
o were there, but mo stly Jewish, I 
believe. And they were taken to a -- to tw
o camp s. But anyhow, he was -- finally he 
ended up in a camp in the Velebit mountains. And he came -- and this was told to 

somebody who was -- who wa -- who was ther
e, he -- this is told by a guy who -- 
Q: Saw. 
A: -- saw it. Who, by the way was a big -- 
became a career Yugoslav officer, he was 
a colonel. And he was a s
ports person in Zagreb, I th
ink he was a skiing champion 
or whatever, something like th
at. So, this group was taken 
to this camp. And as he 
had just pre -- previously been in  the Yu go
slav army , he knew that area and he was 
telling these guys, oh I know where this is, 
this is not bad, lik -- we™ll -- we™ll -- 
we™ll try and get, you know, get together 
and all of these things, and maybe it will 
work  out and so  on. And as he was taken 
to this prison, a fr 
-- somebody
 from the 
same year of law school, not a friend but
 somebody he knew, who became a Ustaıa 
officer, I believe, or maybe n -- anyhow, 
he was there and saw him. And being a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
133
nice person, he wrote his parents say -- sayi
ng I saw Dragon today at such and such 
a place. He didn™t say he™s alive, but that 
was obvious. They were
 a fairly prominent 
family and -- and the parents took a pos
tcard and wrote him 
a postcard saying, 
we™re in Zagreb, hope you™re 
okay, that™s it. Th
e commander of the camp saw  this, 
this was intercepted and brought to th
e commander of the camp , the Ustaıa, who 
said, how come your parents know wh er
e you are? This guy had absolutely -- 
Q: No id ea. 
A: -- I mean this had been -- this had been
 intercepted. He never got the card from 
the parents. He said, what are you talking 
ab out? He says, you 
told your parents, 
you wrote your parents to say wh
ere you were. He sa
id, no I did not 
[indecipherable]. And -- and -- and he exec
uted him right there on the spot, he cut 
his head off. I mean, th is guy 
knows, who told  this story.
 This kind of material I 
was running into. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I mean, this -- this is somebody w
ith -- I was photographed with , you know, 
standing behind me and I guess doing waltzes and stuff. 

Q: Geez.  

A: It -- it w as just, you know. And some of 
it -- y -- all of it was pretty devastating, 
but when  this was some -- and the horrible 
part about this guy was that he begged 

my father the way we -- the day before we
 left, why don™t you take [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
134
we all going to get messed up, you are 
bu -- you know who you
 are, you -- you -- 
you know, you -- I can™t. I would love to, 
I can™t do it, out of the question. My 
mo ther was very fond of him, and I -- I 
was totally uninterest
ed. But I -- obviously, 
if I -- we -- we could have -- 
Q: Saved his life, sure. 
A: -- helped  him and saved, I mean, ev
ery -- everything woul
d have done. And it 
looked menacing, but it didn™t look
 quite as menacing as all that. 
Q: As that, right. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So -- 

A: And another friend like that, the German friend. 
Q: Yeah. So  here you are,
 you know, 50 years later -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- re -- 6 0  years later, readi
ng all these -- findi
ng out things -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- about people you knew and -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- putting together this picture, more 
-- in more detail, be
cause you already knew 
a lot.  

A: I knew a lot. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
135
Q: Because you™d been going back
 and forth all those years. 
A: Yes, I knew a lot, but I certainly di
dn™t know what I found 
out in the museum. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And not even vaguely. Not even vaguely
. We knew that people were starving, 
but we didn™t know to what extent this 
went. We knew that people were rounded 
up. One of the touching stories that -- 
th at ca me fro m th e mu seu m was a wo man  
from a village -- 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the Unite
d States Holo caust Memo rial Museum 
interview with Lucie Ro
senberg. This is tape four, side B.  

A: This woman tells the story. She was 
-- I don™t know wh ether she was -- she -- 
she mu  -- she was probably  a peasant. She says, we were standing th ere, and wo men 
-- and then later I think she 
wa -- she says Jewish women, but I don™t think she -- 

this was her first thought. This must ha
ve been  wh at [indecipherable] I mean 
suggested to her, maybe. She said thes
e women were coming in  and th ey were 

obviously from town because they were
 walking with their pocket -- they had 

pocketbooks. They had never s -- yo
u know, this was not common in 
[indecipherable] where you had things in
 pockets, hidden pockets, or in -- in 
bandanas or whatever, like th
at. But she said these were
 women from town and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
136
were -- they were dressed with hats and -- 
and some had -- this came up later in the 
story, they -- some came w
ith -- with children 
in -- in prams, you know, in -- what 
do you call those, strollers? No, they didn™t
 have strollers, but whatever. They wer -
- had babies in th -- in baby carriages. 
And -- and dressed with hats, maybe even  
gloves, who knows? It™s just -- it™s -- 
Q: She had never seen that. Or sh
 -- or that™s how she identif -- 
A: This -- this is how sh e identif
ied these were people from town. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: The [indecipherable] not at all.
 I mean, she would have been -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- she may not have been weari
ng a -- a full costume, but she was -- 
Q: Right. And what was the 
story she was telling about? 
A: She was staring -- telling the story ab
out women being ro unded -- had been  --  
Q: Oh. 

A: -- that had been ro unded up, being marched into a camp . 
Q: I see. 
A: Or maybe were already in a camp and 
she saw them marching them off to a -- to 
wherever th e -- you know, wh atever their quarters would have been . 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: And they  would have, you know, pe
ople didn™t know, they got dressed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
137
Q: They didn™t know wh
ere they  were going. 
A: No. Pe-People had very little
 imagination at that -- 
Q: You know, it™s so interesting, I keep coming back  to this, about your father 
having th is foresight -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- to get out and in so me ways that, yo
u know, it™s because of the circles that he 
moved in . He knew things. 

A: Yes, he knew. 
Q: But these other people c
ouldn™t have known, or -- or 
would not have known first 
hand and perhaps wo uldn™t have been as re
ady to  believe as he was, since he knew 
these people and he -- 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- sort of --  

A: Yes. 

Q: -- probably had info rmation that other people -- 
A: Yes, he -- yes. 
Q: -- wouldn™t be as likely to believe as he was. 

A: And would not have been -- and you kn
ow, one of his very close friends, and 
this is a very strange story, for years,
 was the Count Joseph Bomb ale. And Jo seph 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
138
Bomb ale was his hunting co m -- they were
 hunting co mp anions. And Bomb ale was 
a much better shot than my 
father, but they kind of -- 
Q: A count from where? 
A: From Croatia. 
Q: Oh, there were counts there? 
A: There were counts -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- galore.  
Q: It was a kingdom, I g -- I for -- 
A: No, no, but this was -- they -- th
ey -- th-this is a Napoleonic one. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And -- and -- and there were counts -- Au
stro-Hungarian, Hungarian, Croatian, I 
mean, counts, barons, plemeniti, what, I me
an, there was -- there w as a hierarchy of 
-- of -- 

Q: How do you say 
count in Croatian? 
A: Grof. 

Q: Grof. 

A: Grof. So this was Grof Joseph Bombal
e, who was a very close friend of my 
father™s. And one of the things, of course, 
was that he was part of that consti -- it 
wasn™t a concern, it wa -- th -- this gro
up of -- of agricultural manufacturers of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
139
alcohol th at were -- that -- that was a -- what
 should I say, I -- it 
was a thi -- wi -- I -
- I will say a -- you know, an organization that
 got together and so on. And he -- he 
was part of it and he was absolutely a mise
rab le businessman and my father tried to 
teach him what business was and so on. And 
he had a particular significance for me 
because I™d known him from, you know, ch
ildhood on. That poin t I was maybe 15 
and came in and we shook hands and he ki
ssed my  hand and I knew I™d grown up. I 
-- I -- maybe I had just come back from Engl
and, maybe I was 16. Boy, I really had 
it. And I thought he was a bachelor the rest 
-- for all my  life, I was very -- we were 
close, I mean, Father was w
ith him all the time. Not all 
the time, b u t often. When 
I™m here at a Slovistics conf
erence, sitting and listening to
 something, and I had my 
tooth pulled just a couple of days earlie
r and I was still under all kinds of -- had 
been taking all kinds of -- of
 -- of -- of painkillers and I thought I wasn™t in my right 
mind. I come to this one room and presen
ting is a Slovistics professor called Joseph 
Bombale. So I said, have I gone out of my
 mind? This was a bachelor when I left. 
He was -- he was killed in Jasenovac also, 
by the way. And rightly so. And I went 
to him, I said, what™s going on? And I sa
id, is your aunt so and so? Co untess Nun-
Nundine? Married a swi -- a 
-- a Dutch wh at would you call it, a dut -- a Dutch 
diplomat. He said yes. I said, is your aunt 
so and so, Josephine? He said yes. I said, 
my  God, I thought Joseph Bomb ale was a b
achelor. And he said, 
that does not mean 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
140
anything. And th en I talked 
some more to him. He knew 
exactly where, what and so 
on.  
Q: Hm. 

A: And there™s a very nice picture of th
e place where they liv
ed, it was the most 
beautiful park in all of Croatia, is a nav 
-- a natura -- a park with fantastic things 
that had been done by his -- 
planted by his grandfather, 
great grandfather, and so -- 
so anyhow, this man, first of all h e was 
taken to jail because he was a Freemason, 
and he was killed. But also, I think, in f
act I™m sure, he was 
being extra smart and 
the Ustaıa were smarter. He had been 
a hunting comp anion of Co unt Charno, who 
was Mussolini™s brother-in-law. And -- whic
h my  father knew, 
that they™d been 
there. But what my father di
dn™t know is that they had 
sort of worked it out that -- 
and in fact this went on for a little while, 
that some Italian pr
ince was going to be 
declared the king of Croatia -- and this went
 on fo r a very short while and then this 
was somehow eliminated. I would have to
 look it up exactly how to say -- how it 
worked out. And this good friend 
of ours was playing two sides. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And maybe less than a week before we we
re to leave, he said to my father, you 
have nothing to fear, I™m here to protect
 you from everything there is. He ended up 
dead. Bu t he was playing tw o sides.  

Q: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
141
A: And -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- he was one of the Croats who -- who was killed in Jasenovac. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And put in because he was 
a Freemason, was the story -- 
Q: Yeah, but obviously  there was a -- 
A: -- but them not looking at anything. 

Q: -- [indecipherable] other stuff. 
A: But there was a lot more. 
Q: Right. 

A: There was much mo re to it than that. 
Q: Right. 
A: And, you know, this was maybe I don™
t know, two weeks, a week before. And 
my father said listen -- 

Q: Before you left? 
A: Before we left. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: My father I know said to him at the time,
 so if everything is fine, we™ll return. 
Q: Hm. 
A: And he meant it --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
142
Q: Yeah. [indecipherable] 
A: -- that -- you know, that wasn™t a -- he
 meant it, he thought 
that he was going to 
outsmart somebody and he was going to be 
doing th is and doing 
that. And later on, 
maybe -- maybe -- I don™t know, six months ago, I read a story in one of the -- 

somebody was doing a reminiscence in one of
 the things p-put out by th e Croatian -
-by the -- by the -- what is it called, by 
the -- by the Jewish Community Center in 
Zagreb, where this ma n™s sister,  who was 
married by that -- that [indecipherable] 
Count Ansenberg -- was it Ansenberg? I be
lieve so -- had been shielding some 
Jewish women some where in
 the house in Zagreb . 
Q: There -- I guess there was never any though
t that you would go 
into hiding, since 
you had a chance to get out. 
A: At that moment there was not. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: At that mo ment. But, you know, I -- pe
ople did go out and I -- the first thought 
for everybody th at I know of who could 
and who had the imagination to  know what 
was going to  happen is to go down  to Dalm
atia. First of all it was u nder Italian 

occupation and it was a different population. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Well, in first place y ou 
would not have been known. 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
143
A: I mean, in Zagreb ever
ybody knew who you were. 
Q: Right. 
A: Probably we would have gone 
down  to the south. Probably . 
Q: If you™d done something sooner, you mean? 
A: No, if we™d done something late, if we had been caught. 
Q: Later, I see. 

A: If we had been  caught there -- 

Q: I see. 
A: -- but -- but I don™t think 
that would -- would have --  
Q: Mm-hm, uh-huh -- 
A: -- been able to do it. 
Q: Uh-huh, I see what you™re saying.
 Let me -- let me -- the -- you have 
grandchildren now? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And how will, when the time comes, how
 -- what -- what about -- what is there 
about your story that you would want th
em to understand and -- and reme mb er? 
A: Tolerance is what I would like them to
 know and I think they  probably are quite 
tolerant, both of them. I -- I don™t -- I don™t know. The boy is a engineer -- you 
know, I keep talking. I thin
k they think this is -- no, 
they don™t think it™s an old 
wives™ tale. He was Bar Mitzvahed and -- but
 I don™t think he™s particularly Jewish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0078
  
 
 
 

 
144
oriented, although he™s well aware that he
 is Jewish. Mya was Bat Mitzvahed also, 
and is a very assiduous memb er of a -- of
 a sy nagogue in Boston with a female 
rabbi. Sh e goes to all services and so on . Good about it. Their name is Lindley. 
They had their father™s name. Jan e was Lindley for awhile too, th
en she reverted to 
Rosenberg. And hi -- she™s much more Je
wish oriented than I am, Mya, and she 

knows what happened, I mean, I keep te
lling them and -- when I get a chance, I 
don™t want to overdo it. I keep showing th
em pictures of one thing or another. I was 
thinking of taking -- I mean, you know, taki
ng them to Zagreb. 
And I probably will 
eventually, the girl, b
ecause I think they need to see 
where this is from. I -- I d on™t 
know, I don™t -- I -- I -- I really don™t kn
ow wh at about that. You know, it doesn™t 
pain me in any way. I would like them to 
know -- to know th eir history, wh ichever 
way it is. On their father™s side it™s a very  interesting -- there™s part American Indian 

there, which I think is very nice, very
 interesting. Part Swiss, a great -- a 
grandmother who came, and I believe she was with one of those she di -- the family 

mu st have been one of those sects, relig
ious sects from around Bern who came to 
Pennsylvania and then went 
on to Ohio . And the other pa
rt was Scotch, English and 
they™re -- for instance, bo -- I think has -- Jo ey has -- is a particular kind of -- of 

way one™s back teeth look, if
 you have any Indian backgr
ound and his are like that 
and there™s some kind of a story about 
a great-grandmother who was an Indian  
princess who has been -- who had -- who wa
 -- who -- no, who was a settler™s child

who had been taken by the -- by an  Indian 
tribe in Ohio and th
er-there where these 
mounds are, near -- near -- in Ohio. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And then returned as -- 
there™s a book ab out her, I don™t know wh at the name is. 
And she -- she ret -- sh e was finally brought 
back to her family, I guess. I -- I -- I 
like these stories.  

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I -- I -- I don™t know -- I d -- I don™t 
know when th ey w
ill be aware of, you 
know, who I really am. I™m Granny. I do have 
to say that -- that -- that I used to sing 
wonderf -- in a very bad voic
e, but some wonderful Croatia
n songs to both of them 
as -- as -- y ou know, lullabies. And my favo
rite one is [speaks Croatian here],  did 
you see my  sli -- son Janko? And it™s a w
onderful story about this mother asks 
people in the village or on the ro ad  or 
whatever, did you see 
my son, Janko? And 
everybody said no, we haven™t seen him, 
but we have heard rumo rs that he was 
accosted by three young Turks. And he said 
-- one of Turks said to him, Janko, if -- 
an-an-anyhow, it ends up by -- by -- by sayi
ng how courageous Janko is and so on. 
This is -- this is -- this -- thes
e were their nursery rhymes, I -- 
Q: Mm-hm, but I mean, they™re
 still pretty young, I mean -- 
A: Not th at young, no. Joe is -- 

Q: Mi -- teenagers?

A: Oh, no. 
Q: No? 
A: No, Joey just graduated, he
™s an engineer, he™s what, 24. 
Q: Oh, graduated from college? 
A: And Mya is 27. 
Q: Oh, oh, they™re -- they™re adults. 

A: They™re adults. 

Q: But do you feel satisfied 
that you have done 
your part to tell them your story and 
to impart whatever lessons 
you™ve -- you would like them to have from -- from your 
experience and -- 

A: Yes, I collar them every once in awh
ile, and -- and try to tell them. And when, 
for instance, when a picture 
comes around, you know, I -- I try to say listen, this is 
so and so , this is a -- y eah, I do -- I don™
t want to overdo it. It™s not that I™m 

reluctant by any means. 

Q: Right. 
A: But usually the-they™re not la -- not arou
nd long en ough. I have to find the right 
moment to do it. But I do it. I mean, they 
know exactly who was 
what in the family 
and how I grew up and -- a
nd how we left and ab out my
 brother and all of that, 
sure. 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m, mm-h m.

A: They know, they know. 
She is -- I mean, not only 
is she politically correct, I 
mean, to an extent, you can imagine. She™s very much so
. And -- and he™s -- he™s a 
nice boy. 
Q: Good. Obviously , you had su ch an amazi
ng variety of experiences and -- is there 
anything you want to br
ing up and talk about that I haven™t touched on? 
A: I don™t think so. I think we™re -- you™
ve been fantastically good at eliciting 
whatever there was -- 

Q: Good. 
A: -- and really not -- 
Q: There™s a lot. 

A: -- and very, very patient. 
Q: There™s a lot -- 
A: Thanks a lot. 

Q: -- and it™s hard to -- you know, I 
don™t know wh at I don™t know, so -- 
A: Ah, you know very mu ch. I do want 
to say that Morris 
has been somebody 
extraordinarily w
onderful and very patient. I -- this 
wasn™t very easy for him, I was 
-- he was constantly  surrounded by -- by my
 family. And you know, we stayed with 
his family and all -- that -- that was all 
wonderful and -- and -- and great, but I think 
we were more with my part of the family
 and I think I™ve always felt like they were 
-- they were -- they were surrounding 
him and telling him and so on. He knew

exactly what was going on, I mean, he was there, among the very  first people who 
came to Yugoslavia after the war, because he
 was in Bari and he
 was waiting to go, 
I believe to Germany and -- and -- and a 
friend came by and said, why don™t you go 
to Yugoslavia? We don™t know
 wh at™s going to happen  ther
e, so first he went to 
Albania and then he went to Yu goslavia. So
, he went to Belgrade right away, so -- 
he wa -- he was taken by the people in 
that country , and ever
ything else, and -- and 
so, he was -- but I -- you know, I d -- I do liv
e in the past to a certain extent. I try 
not to, but I do. And specially now that 
I was so -- so -- not now, I mean, now 
obviously, where you had the patience to
 listen to me, but in the museum -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- when all of the 
stuff started coming by -- 
Q: Well there™s -- so 
much was unresolved. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Yeah. It™s hard to break away. 

A: I mean, you know what so
 and so was killed, but you 
don™t know until you see it 
on a piece of paper where it says the date, or -- or -- or whatever. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. Good. Thank you. 

A: I thank you very mu ch. 
Q: This has been a pleasure.
