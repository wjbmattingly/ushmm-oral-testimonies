Marc el Dr im er was  bor n in Dr ohobyc z, Poland, a small town now part of Uk r aine.  The ar row 
on this  map of Eur ope from  1933 points to
 
Poland.  Mar c el's  father, J ac ob, worked as an accountant in 
a lumber fac tor y while his  mother r ais ed Marc el and his  younger  s ister, Irena.

In this  photo we s ee Mar c el and his  m other  Laura in 1934.
 
 
Germ any and the Soviet Union attacked Poland in Septembe
r 
1939, beginningWor ldWar II.  
This  is an historic al photogr aph of German tr oops  par ading throughWarsaw after  the s urrender of 
Poland.
 
 
On J une
 
22, 1941, Germany violated the Ger man
-
Soviet pac t and attacked Soviet terr itor y.  
Within a few weeks  Drohobycz was  oc c upied by Germ an forc es .
 
 
In 1942, m em ber s of Mar c el's  family, inc luding his  gr andfather , whom  we s ee here, were 
deported to extermination c amps  wher e they wer e m urder ed.
 

 
In the fall of 1942, Marc el and his  fam ily wer e for ced into the Dr ohobyc z 
ghetto.  This  is  an 
his tor ic al photograph of J ews  being for c ed into the Dr ohobyc z ghetto.
 
 
Befor e the liquidation of the ghetto, the family es c aped to a small village.  In Augus t
 
1943, 
Marc el went into hiding with a Polis h
-
Ukrainian fam ily.  Her e we s ee photos  of J an Sawins ki and Zofia 
Sawins ki, the fam ily who hid Mar c el and his  family.
 
 
Marc el's  family is  s een in this  photo taken in 1947 or 1948.  From left

r ight we s ee Marc el's  
Unc le Abraham Dr imer , his  parents , Laur a and Jac ob, and Mar c el's  Unc le Abra
ham  Gr uber .
 
         
 
In 1957, Marc el ear ned a degr ee in m echanic al engineering. He emigrated to the United 
States in 1961 wher e his wife, Ania, joined him in 1963. Soon after arrival in the U.S. he was  hir ed by 

the U.S. Post Offic e Depar tment to wor k  on the des ign of mail s or ters  and c onveyors . After a ver y 

s uc c es sful period with the Pos t Offic e Department, Marc el transferr ed to the U.S. Arm y as  a c ivilian in 
1972. He then wor ked as a m ec hanic al engineer for the Army Corps of Engineers. Although Mar c el 
off
ic ially r etir ed fr om the Ar my in 1994 he r emained a c ons ultant with the Ar my until 2010. He is now 
tr uly r etir ed.
 
        
 
Ania tr ained as a pharmac is t in Poland and c ontinued her profes s ion after her arr ival in the 
U.S. and is  now als o r etired. Mar c el and
 
Ania have a son, Adam , who lives in Ric hmond. They have 
two gr andc hildren, Mar y, age 13, and J ack , who is  15. They are both in the Inter national Bac c alaureate 

program.
 
       
 
Although offic ially Mar c el and Ania are retir ed, they both do consider able work
 
as volunteer s  
with the mus eum. Marc el and Ania trans late doc um ents wr itten in Polis h. They tr ans lated portions  of 

"Em anuel Ringelblum's Notes " from the Wars aw Ghetto" a 25,000
-
page collec tion of diaries and other  
doc um ents  detailing the events  and lives  of thos e who lived in the doom ed Wars aw Ghetto. They als o 

r ec ently trans lated pers onal mem oir s  by two J ewis h young women who s uffer ed terr ibly dur ing the war. 
In appr ec iation for the tr ans lations , the families  of thes e women donated generous ly to this  m us eu
m . 
Marc el and Ania als o worked on the c urr ent m us eum exhibit titled, "Som e Were Neighbors : 

Collaboration and Com plic ity in the Holoc aus t," whic h opened in 2013. To help with the exhibit, they 
r eviewed and tr ansc ribed s ever al film ed testimonies  and made r ec omm endations  about their  potential 
s ignific anc e to the exhibit. They are quite a team.
 
 
I'd like to note that
 
An
ia is  in the audienc e with Mar c el right up front.
 
 
Welc om e, Ania.

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on: Marc el speaks publicly about his  Holoc aus t experienc e in var ious  s ettings. He was  a 

s peaker with Mia Far row at an event in Gettys burg, Penns ylvania, and s poke to cadets  from our four 
m ilitary Ac ademies who were on their way to vis it Aus c hwitz. Marc el als o s peak s  to students  and 
fac ulty at univers ities  and at s ever al feder al agenc ies  inc luding the U.S. Depar tm ent of Agr ic ulture.
 
        
 
Marc el rec ently donated photographs of gr eat s ignific anc e to him as  well as  a ring whic h 
played a role in his  s urvival, whic h we will hear  mor e about today. 
 
 
With that 
I'd like to ask you to join m e in welc om ing our
 
Firs t Pers on

Marcel Drimer.

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marc el, thank  you s o muc h for joining us and for your willingnes s to be our
 
Firs t 
Person
.  Ther e's s o much for  you to s har e with us  and we have a brief per iod, s o we will s tart.
 
 
WorldWar II began in Septem ber
 
1939
,  
when Germ any attacked Poland fr om  the wes t, 
quickly followed by the Soviet Union attacking Poland fr om the east.  Early  in the war  you and your  

3 
 
family lived under  Rus s ian oc c upation. 
 
But befor e we talk  about that time and the events  that followed, 
tell us  a little bit about your  family and your  c ommunity in Dr ohobyc z before the war  began. 
 
> > Marc el Drim er:  My fam ily was s mall.  My father, J ac ob, my mother, Laura, Irena and I.  Fathe
r  was  
the oldes t of five s iblings.  Mother was  the oldest of four s iblings . We were m iddle c las s.
 
 
The population of Dr ohobyc z was  Ukr ainian, Polis h, and J ewis h, about 15,000, 16,000, each 
group.  They were neighbor neighborly.  They were living s ide
-
by
-
s ide.  Eac h of thes e gr oups  had their  
own c ultur al fac ilities .  They had s por ts  fac ilities .  Ther e wer e even s c hools  that they c ould learn
 
--
 
the 
Ukrainian c ould lear n Uk rainian, Pols  and the J ews .  Ever yone would hav e to learn Polis h, of c ours e.
 
It was  a peac eful town
, v
er y nic e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  On Septem ber
 
17, 1939, s hor tly after  Germany invaded Poland, Rus s ia attack ed 
Poland.  As a res ult, you would live under Rus s ian oc c upation until J une
 
1941.  Tell us  what that time 
was  like for you and your c omm unity and your family when you were under Rus s ian oc c upation.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  We, as  J ews, wer e not s pec ific ally pic ked on. We were in as  bad of s hape as 
ever ybody els e.  The Rus s ians  took  away factories .  They took  big farms .  They s ent people that they 
c ons idered enem ies  of the s tate to Siberia.  Am ong them wer e the parents  of m y wife, Ania.  They were 
s ent to Siber ia wher e s he was  bor n during the war .
 
The Germ an
 
--
 
the Rus s ians  tr ied to m ake this  part 
like part of Rus s ia.  They wer en't very s uc c essful. 
 
 
The J ews  of Dr ohobyc z hear d what was  going on
 
--
 
it's  a little too br ight.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'll tr y to get them to tur n them down.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  So we knew what was  going on in the wes ter n part of Poland.  Ther e were s een 

s om e people that managed
 
to get out and c ome to Dr ohobyc z.  We met thes e people.  They s tayed 
with us .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During that time were you able to go to sc hool under the Rus s ians ?
 

> > Marc el Drim er :  I was  ready to go to kindergarten but I had to go to a Uk r ainian kindergarten and I 
didn't s peak  Uk rainian, so it was  a little tr aumatic  but not too bad.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  May
 
1 is , of c ours e, a s ignific ant date in the Comm unist world.  And your  birthday is  
May
 
1, c om ing up very s oon.  Tell us  about the s ignific anc e of your  birthday and that date.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  I was  born in m y gr andpar ents' hous e.  At that time there was  a doc tor there but 
ther e was  nobody to take c ar e of the dates .  My father was  s or t of leaning a little to the left s o when he 
went to the governm ent offic e to r egis ter me, he dec ided
 
--
 
I was  actually born April
 
30 but father went 
ther e and told them that I was  bor n May
 
1.  I was  pr obably bor n 15, 20 minutes  before May
 
1.  
 
 
If you don't s ay, I won't say.

[Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Soon after
, 
Germ any tur
ned on the Soviet Union in J une
 
1941, German troops  
oc c upied Dr ohobyc z and life for J ews  then c hanged dr amatic ally and tr agic ally.  What did the Nazis  do 
after  taking c ontr ol of your  town and what was  the effec t on your family?
 
> > Marc el Drim er:  The Germ a
ns s tar ted r ight away.  They had a bunc h of r ules  for  the Jews , what they 

c an or c annot do.  J ewish c hildren would not go to s c hool.  The J ews  wer e not allowed to walk on the 

s idewalk.  The J ews  had to wear an arm band with the Star of David.
 
 
The Germ ans
 
started ak tion, they would c om e to the J ewis h hous es  and take away whatever  
they wanted to take away.  They would kill people indis c r iminately.
 
On the fir st day of Germ ans in 
Drohobyc z, this was  J uly
 
1 of 1941, they allowed the Ukr ainians
 
--
 
Uk r ainian nationalis ts , to go to 
J ewis h hom es  and take whatever they want to and beat up thes e people.  Well, on that day the hous e 
of my mother's  parents  wer e robbed and m y gr andfather  was  beaten up.  He died in a few days  
bec aus e there was  no acc es s  to the doctors  or
 
to hos pitals.
 
 
When they wer e leaving the house, they took  with them  the album s of photos .  And, of c ours e, 
they wer e not inter ested in the photos.  They wer e inter ested in the albums .  So they s hook out the 

photos  fr om the album s.
 
After the war  my father
 
went there to s ee what's left of the hous e.  A neighbor  
c am e out and gave m y father a stack  of photos .  All of thes e photos  Bill was  talking about, they are all 

now at the Holoc aus t m useum.  The first photo of m e with m y m other was  in that stock .
 
> > Bill 
Bens on:  Otherwis e if he hadn't s aved them , you wouldn't have any.
 

4 
 
> > Marc el Drim er:  No.  Dur ing the oc c upation we wer e m oving plac es lik e 19 tim es but you wouldn't 
worr y about photos.  You had to take with you other  things.
 
 
There was  als o an ak tion like
 
that near  wher e I was  bor n.  It's  a bigger c ity.  My father was  
ther e attending s om e c ours es , univers ity cour s es.  He was  with my Aunt Rivke.  At that plac e about 

5,000 J ews  wer e killed on the fir st few days  of July.
 
 
In Dr ohobyc z, about 200 people were killed and about 800 people wer e wounded for  the fir st.  
The other things  the Germ ans  did in Dr ohobyc z, they s tar ted r ationing food.  The Germ ans' idea of 

dis c r imination of killing the J ews  wer e m ultiple
, t
hey would outr ight kill them .  They would s tarve th
em  
to death
 a
nd hum iliate them .  This was  the life the first few days  in Dr ohobycz.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marc el, you m entioned the ak tions  that the Ger mans engaged in.  Tell us  the one 
involv ing your  nanny.  Tell us  about your  nanny.
 

> > Marc el Drim er :  J anc ia,
 
yes , yes . We lived in an apartm ent that was  for our  sm all fam ily but in our 
apar tm ent ther e was  m y father 's s is ter , Rivke, with two c hildr en, whos e hus band was  taken to the 

Rus s ian Arm y.  There was  this grandfather
, 
whos e photo you s aw.  His  wife died.  
And there was  
grandm other, whos e husband was  killed in the firs t few da
ys .  
 
 
So it was  very c r owded.  Hygienic
 
s ituation was  not very good.  I was  very s ic k , s ickly.  And I 
had a nanny who loved me very muc h.  She would c om e to our hous e and br ing s ometimes milk  and 

s om e food.  She said to m y m other that s he will take m e for a few days  to her hous e, feed m e, giv e m e 

a bath, and bring m e back .  
 
 
So s he took me and I was  there.  And a few days  later my sis ter  started c om plaining that s he 
wants  to play with me, she wants  to go and bring m e back .  So my mother took  off her  arm band and 
went to J anc ia's  hous e.  Exc us e m e.
 
 
When s he c am e ther e, to the hous e, I was  s itting in the c or ner  and crying and J anc ia was  in 
labor .  She was  pr egnant.  It was  an ear ly labor.  Bec aus e ther e wer e no doc tor s, no people that c ould 

help us  s o my mother  stayed ther e.  She did whatever s he could
 a
nd helped the baby to c om e
 
but the 
baby was
 
s tillbor n.
 
 
It got quite late.  The husband of J anc ia
 
--
 
s o we stayed ther e over night.  But i
n the m or ning, 
the hus band of J anc ia c ame home.  He was  wor king the night shift.  And he was  very s ur pr is ed and 
ups et about s eeing us  ther e bec aus e he s ays  that ther e was  an aktion going on in Drohobyc z.  
Germ ans 
would kill people on the s pot
 
or take them  
to the plac e wher e they kept them for  a few days  
and then take them to the c onc entr ation camps , exter mination c am ps.
 
So he s ays  you c an't be here 
bec aus e the Germ ans would s ee you here, they would kill us  and you.  And this was  one of the r ules  
impos ed on the J ews
.  The 
non
-
J ewis h people are not allowed to help J ews .  If you give a J ew a glas s 
of water, you were a criminal.
 
 
So he gave my mother  a piec e of br ead and he says  walk over the road and there is  a wheat 
field and then ther e is  a for es t, woods , and
 
you c an try to hide ther e.  So that's what we did. We started 
walking towar ds  the woods .  And then m y mother found a plac e in the weeds .  It was  Augus t s o the 

weeds  wer e r ipe.  And we hid ther e in the indentation.  Mother  c overed us  with her rainc oat.
 
 
Soon we star ted hearing Germ ans s c r eam ing, "Rous , r ous , s c hnell."  Dogs  bark
ing
, shots 
being hear d, people s cr eam ing of pain.  It would quiet down for a few m inutes  and then over and over.  

It was  like five, s ix times.  My s is ter and I c alled it the s ymphony of death.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  All the sounds .
 
> > Marc el Drim er:  All the s ounds , like a s ym phony of death.
 
 
It stopped about 5:00, 6:00
 
in the evening. We waited another  hour  or two.  We got up and 
s tarted walking towar ds  J anc ia's  hous e.
 
As we ac c es s ed the r oads towar ds  her hous e, ther e was  a 
Germ an s oldier  with a big dog.  He was  jus t standing ther e and looking at us  and we wer e s tanding and 
looking at him.  It s eemed like forever  but it was  probably maybe half a minute.  He just tur ned ar ound 
and walked 
away.
 
 
Now, the rule of the Germ an Arm y or Germ an SS, whatever , was  you do not go hunting for 
J ews  by yours elf.  You had to be with som ebody s o that you wouldn't feel hum an and let the pers on 

live. Well, this guy was  by hims elf and just turned ar ound and walked. Walked away.
 

5 
 
 
We c ame to J anc ia's hous e.  We s tayed ther e for another night bec aus e it was  dar k .  And the 
next m or ning my father cam e fr om the lum ber factor y where he wor ked.  Ther e was  a dorm itory wher e 
the m en who didn't have wives  or  c hildren, whos e wives  and c hildren were killed, s tayed.  He c am e and 
took us to our home.
 
 
When we c am e there, the door was br oken in, f
e
athers wer e flying all over  the hous e, and the 
house was  em pty.  They all were taken.  A few days  later  they wer e taken to Belzec, an extermination 

c am p.  The Germans had conc entration c amps  like Aus c hwitz where people would wor k as long as  
they c ould and then they would be killed and new people would c om e.  Ther e were c amps  like Belzec  
wher e people wer e killed imm ediately, s o my fa
m ily was  killed imm ediately .
 
> > B ill Bens on
:  You would live under  thos e c irc ums tanc es  until the fall of 1942 when then you wer e 
for c ed into a ghetto in Drohobyc z.  Tell us what it was  like in the ghetto and how your family was  able to 

m anage onc e you were
 
forc ed into the ghetto with the r emaining J ews  from  your c omm unity.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  My father was  working at the lumber factor y.  He was  taken fr om the gh
etto every 

m or ning by polic emen
 
and would bring him back  to the ghetto.  So he had a c hanc e to bar
ter for food.  
Food was  not s uffic ient.  Food was  not even enough
 
--
 
and only working people would get a piec e of 
br ead.  Non
-
working people got even smaller  portions .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Meaning c hildr en, like yours elf.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  Of c our s e.  Yes. 
 
 
So my father would 
bar ter
.  He would, for  exam ple, s ee
 
--
 
farm ers  would c om e to the town 
with their goats.  My father  would s ee s om ebody s elling br ead and he would s ay, "I'll give you my 

wedding r ings if you give m e two loafs  of bread."  This  was  a tr ue c as e.  Father would s ay we will not 
worr y about things
; w
e will worr y about being alive at the end of that m is erable s ituation.
 
So this  is how 
father managed to bring s om e food.  
 
 
There were als o ver y frequent ak tions  in the ghetto. We had a hole dug out under our 
apar tm ent.  In the ghetto, in the apar tm ent wher e we were, there was  s ever al families .  We had one 

r oom.  And all four of us  s lept on one m attress  bec aus e the bed was  alr eady taken by the Germans .  
So the s ituation was  very, ver y har d to live.
 
 
Fa
ther dec ided that we s hould tr y to get out of the ghetto bec aus e eventually the ghetto 
would
 
--
 
s ooner or later it would have been
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Liquidated.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  Liquidated and all the people would be killed.  So m y father arr anged with
 
the guy 
that was  guiding all the labor er s out and into the ghetto, he br ibed him.  My m other put men's c lothing 
and got my s is ter under her  arm and father took  m e under his arm . We wer e very
 
--
 
not overweight to 
s ay the leas t.
 
 
So we c am e to the plac e wher e father  would get out of the c olum n and father  would put us 
behind a fenc e or  a place there and took  my s is ter and mother and s aid
 
--
 
father pr epar ed a hiding 
plac e for us in the lumber fac tory.  He loos ened the plank s  of the fenc e.  And he s aid to me, 
"You s tay 
her e.  I'll tak e mom and Irena and then I will c ome for  you."  Father left.  
 
 
I got panicky.  I heard people would abandon their c hildr en.  I got ver y s c ar ed.  Father s ays
,  
ﬁY
ou ar e a man.

I was  only 8 year s  old.  So I was n't a m an.  So I got s cared.  So this  was  the firs t tim e 
and I think  the las t one that father s pank ed m e.  He s aid, "I'm only ups et about the fac t that you would 
think  that I would leave y ou behind."
 
 
And in that lumber factory, we wer e hiding in a plac e where the wood was dr i
ed for furnitur e 
and s o forth.  Father would c om e every night and br ing s ome food and tak e out the was te, like for a 
week or two.
 
 
A fr iend of my father, a Chris tian lady, c om es  to my father and s ays
: 
J ac ob, ther e is  this  
woman whos e name is  Ther es c a
; s
he 
s ays  s he sus pec ts that you have s om ebody hiding here and s he 
is  going to make sur e that s he's  r ight and then she's  going to r eport you to the SS.
 
 
Now, why would people do that?  One r eas on was  hatred.  The other reason was  that the 
Germ ans
 
--
 
the bounty f
or a J ew was  a kilos  of flour  or a kilos  of s ugar.  Lives  wer e very 
--
 
very c heap.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You turn in a J ew
 
--
 

6 
 
> > Mar c el Drim er:  And get a kilos  of s ugar, 2.2
 
pounds .
 
 
So my father got terr ibly ups et.  He had friends there, a doctor at the c linic  at the factory.  The 
doc tor was  educated in Vienna. When my father and m other were bor n, Drohobyc z was  als o Hungary.  
So the people wer e educated in Vienna.  They s poke Germ an.  So this  doc tor cam e with an idea that 
he will pr etend that he is  an SS man on leave and wr ote a letter, anonymous , of c ours e, s aying that I 
am  an SS man on leave fr om  the front and I had an enc ounter  with this woman and s he gave m e 

s yphilis .
 
 
The Germ ans  were very touc hy about that.  Firs t of all, fr ater nization with Polis h women
 
was  
not allowed.  And then syphilis  was  s om ething that they didn't want to s pread.
 
 
So the next day two
 S
S men c am e to the factor y and picked up this Ther es c a and took  her to 
the little c linic  where the doc tor was .  So he c onfirmed that s he had s yphilis .
 

 
So I was  always  wondering about the motto of the doc tor
; 
first, do no har m.  He s aid you have 
to s wear that you will do no harm.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But he saved your fam ily.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  He saved, at least tempora
rily, s
aved my fam ily.  She was n't s een until we were 
liberated.  Father had the pleas ure of telling her who c aus ed that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:
  
So her e you are, your father has  c ons truc ted this  amazing little hiding plac e in the 
m iddle of a lumber  factory.  But that c an't las t.  He's  got to get you out of there.  So that's when he goes  

out to find a hiding plac e for you in the c omm unity s om ewher e.  You ended up with this family, the 
Sawins kis .  Tell us about that.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  Father
 
--
 
again, s ooner  or later it would be
 
--
 
father, you know
, he was  an 
ac c ountant, ver y s oft m an.  He was  a wonderful per s on, r eally, but he was  a lion when it c ame to 
s aving the fam ily.  He dec ided that he has  to go to the plac e where my mother was  born.  It's  pr obably 

now a s ubur b but this  was  a village.  And he
 
would go to s ever al farmer s.  He went to one farm er and 
as ked
 w
ould you hide my fam ily and I would give you whatever I have.  Some people would tell him , 
look, you have a watc h, if you don't give me that watc h, I'll r eport you to the Germ ans .  There were 
bad 
people like that.
 
 
But then he c ame to the Sawins kis  who k new my m other as a little girl, the lady.  And s he 
s aid
 
--
 
again, ther e wer e pr om is es, meals , and s o forth.  And s he s ays , "I will take Laura and Ir ena but 
not Marc el."  Bec aus e the s ituation in
 
Poland was  s uc h that only J ewis h men wer e c ir c umc is ed and if 
the Germans would c ome and s ee
 
--
 
only Irena and m other would be there, they c ould be cous ins  from 
another village.  They both had blue eyes  and blond hair .  But the m en or a boy, it would be a 
dis as ter.  
 

 
The Germ ans  would s ee s om ebody outs ide of the ghetto and didn't think  that he 
looked
 
--
 
thought he look ed a little J ewis h, they would ask him to drop his  pants.  And if you were 
c irc umc is ed, he was  dead.
 
 
So the deal was  that s he will c om e to 
the dor mitory wher e father s tayed.  We c am e from the 
hiding plac e.  And Mr s .
 
Sawins ki c ame ther e.  And we started s aying goodbye.
 
 
The older  of you would pr obably remem ber "Sophie's  Choic e," the m ovie.  The wom an had a 
c hoic e to whic h c hild to save and whic h c hild to let go.  And this  was  my mother, "Sophie's  
C
hoic e."  
 
 
But m y father  was  determined that we had to s ave whoever  we c an s ave.
 
I was  c rying.  My 
m other  was  c rying.  Mr s .
 
Sawins ki was  c rying.  At one point s he s ays , "Whatever  will be, will be.  I 
am a 
m other .  I have my own c hildren and I c an unders tand you.  So whatever will be, will be.  Take the boy 

with you."  And Mrs .
 
Sawins ki took the three of us and we walked thr ough the r ivers  and fores ts and s o 
forth and we c am e to the Sawins kis ' hous e. 
 
 
This  was  a ver y
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You'r e going to describe for us their hous e.
 
> > Mar c el Dr im er:  Right.  It was  a
 
thatc hed r oof hous e.  Ther e was  no floor in the house.  It was  ver y, 
very pr imitive.  So when we c ame ther e, in the beginning we were in the stable, hiding in the stable.  My 
s is ter would look out and there were c hickens playing and s he would s ay, "Why c ouldn't I be a c hicken" 
being allowed to r un ar ound, why do we have to hide.
 

7 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you were hiding, in the stable, hiding in a
 
s pac e between the roof and, a stall, 
s om e s pac e?
 
> > Marc el Drim er:  Right.  Ther e was  no c himney.  The sm oke would c ome out thr ough
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  A hole in the r oof.
 
> > Marc el Drim er:  Right.  The roof.  So this  was  in the winter time when it was  c ol
d.
 
 
And als o, the food s ituation was  ver y bad bec aus e the Rus s ian s ys tem applied to them, too.  
The farm ers  c ould not s laughter an animal without notifying the Germans.  So it was  very har d to get 

food.
 
 
So what they did, there was  a 12
-
year
-
old boy.  His  
nam e was  Tadek  [phonetic ].  He would 
take a c art with a big c ontainer  and go to the factory.  Ther e was  a refinery.  Ther e were oil wells  and 
r efineries .  And the big refinery where my unc le wor ked, he would go ther e and take
 
--
 
sc r ape fat fr om 
the tables  
wher e people ate.  My unc le was  a butc her .  He would give Tadek  a piec e of meat every 
onc e in a while.  But if the Ger mans  would find out, of c ourse he would be killed immediately.
 
 
So Tadek  would c om e hom e. We had the fir s t
 
--
 
before the pigs  got their p
or tion, we c ould 
pic k  from whatever  would s till be edible.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marc el, when you firs t went to the Sawinskis ' home, it was  you and your mother  and 
your  s is ter.  How m any of the Sawins ki family were living in this  c ottage, this  little c ottage?
 
>
>  Mar c el Dr imer :  There was  four c hildren living ther e.  The youngest one was  12 or 13 years old.  I 
s till am  very thank ful that they did not squeal, that thes e young kids  did not s ay anything.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause their lives  wer e c ompletely at r isk .
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  Abs olutely.  Abs olutely.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And not only did you have to wor ry about getting food becaus e they had only limited 
r ations  but if anybody, from  what you told me, neighbor s , were to notic e that ther e wer e m ore people or 

they wer e getting in more food, that would rais e sus pic ions , too.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  They c ouldn't go to a s tor e and buy
 
--
 
ther e wer e r ations  but ther e was  als o a blac k  
m arket that you c ould buy for more m oney.  But if they would go out
 
--
 
there was  s ix of them.
  
I didn't 
m ention that m y father  came ther e, then my unc le.  There was  13 of us.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Yes.  Eventually you ended up with 13 people in this  little c ottage.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  In addition to thes e people.  The s ituation was  ver y
 
--
 
we c ouldn't b
athe.  We bathed 
onc e a m onth.  Ther e were bed bugs , lic e, s ic k nes s es .  Only when m y little s is ter was  s o s ick , we were 

worr ied how would we bur y her  without s howing that s omebody is  there.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause you c ouldn't get m edical c are for her.
 
>>
 
Marc el Dr im er :  Abs olutely not.  Abs olutely not.  So it was
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So s ome of you had to hide in a little attic  s pac e.  And that's wher e the s mok e c ame 
up.  So you'r e 
c
onstantly having sm oke in your fac e from the fir e.
 
>> Marcel Drimer:  My 
eyes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And other s  of the 13 additional people, s ome wer e hiding in a little stable. Was n't 
ther e a hole undergr ound?
 

> > Marc el Drim er:  Yeah.  There was  a hole undergr ound in the hous e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Under their dirt floor.
 
> > Mar c el Dr

the allies
 
--
 
planes would c ome and bom b the factor ies  there.  Ever ybody was hiding. We would come 
out.
 
 
We had to be in a lie down pos ition or  s itting position and we wer e not s uppos ed to talk  loud 
bec aus e it was  dangerous .  This  is  how we lived ther e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  For almos t for a year ?
 
> > Marc el Drim er:  10 months .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  10 months  in thos e c irc um stanc es .
 
> > Marc el Drim er:  Without talking, without pl
aying
, n
o entertainm ent.  Of c our s e, father tr ied to s ing 
s om e s ongs  whis pering.  Can you imagine?  Well, it was  a ver y, very bad thing.

> > Bill Bens on:  So as you wer e des c r ibing, as  the Rus s ians  got c los er , they wer e s tarting to bomb the 
r efineries .  And
 
that's  when you c ould c om e out when everybody els e was  hiding fr om  the bombing.
 
When did it end for you? 
 
>> Marcel Drimer:  The
 
--
 
Drohobyc z was  liber ated by the Red Army in August
 
1944.  I was  10 year s  
old.  I couldn't walk really bec aus e m y mus c les  were atr ophied.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause you had been in the c ram ped pos itions .
 

> > Marc el Drim er:  And lying down.  And I c ouldn't talk  loud bec aus e we were whis per ing all the time.
 
We left the plac e in the sam e c lothes  that we c ame in 10 or 12 months ago, bar efoot.  My father was 

m ade d
ir ec tor of the lumber  fac tory.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  By the Rus s ians .
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  By the Rus s ians .  He had a big desk, s itting behind a des k , but he was  barefoot.  

Some Rus s ian gener als  c am e
 
--
 
the front was  near by.  So fathe
r pr ovided lum ber for  the front.  And the 
general s ays : Wh
oa, you ar e a big dir ec tor .  You c an't be bar efoot.  So they gave him  the soldier 's 
boots, and s maller boots for  m e.  This was  how we s tar ted.
 
 
As  I told you in the beginning, there was  about 15 or 16,000 people in Drohobyc z
, i
n Augus t of 
1944
. M
os t of the s urviv ors  c am e to the middle of the town and ther e was  about 450 of us left.
 
There were s om e that c ame fr om Russ ia that were deported and c am e bac k  from  Rus s ia.  And there 

were s om e that c ame fr om 
the c onc entr ation c amps  and fr om  the Army, Rus s ian Arm y.  So maybe 600 

all that s ur vived fr om the 16,000 of the Jews  in Poland.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marc el, if you don't m ind, you had mentioned that your  uncle, his  forc ed labor  was  to 

work as a butc her, I think , at the refinery.  Eventually he would end up in hiding with you.  You 
m entioned that.  Quickly tell us  that s tor y.
 
> > Marc el Drim er :  This  was  a wonderful stor y.  When he was  in the ghetto, one of the c r ys tal 
c handeliers  fell down and s pr ead the c rys tals around.  So he picked up s om e of the c r ys tals  and asked 
a friend
 
--
 
this  was  in the ghetto, when we needed to hide.  So he picked up thes e c r ys tals and asked a 
fr iend who was  a jeweler  to make a ring that look ed like diamonds.  And he kept that r i
ng.  
 
 
He was  at the fac tory working as a butc her and his  wife was  ther e, and the little c hild.  They 
were taken by the Germans  and taken to a forest where people were killed.  Somebody c am e to him 
and told him  your wife was  taken.  So he knew a German.  He s poke
 
fluent Germ an and told the 
Germ an what happened.  So the Ger man s ays , well, I'll take my motorc yc le and we'll try to c atc h up 

with the tr uck.  They did not c atc h up.  As they c ame to the for es t, the truck  c ame back  with c lothes.  
 
 
When the Germ ans killed
 
people, they asked them to disr obe.  And he looked at the truck  and 
ther e was  the s hoes  of his  little gir l.  He was  terribly ups et.  He dec ided he would not do anything about 

it but s till life is life.  He notic ed a little girl that looked J ewis h play ing 
at the yar d he was  wor king so he 
s aid, 
ﬁ
I want to talk to your m om.
ﬂ
  
So s he took  her
 
--
 
to
ok  him to her mom .  So he s aid 
you c an't have 
that c hild playing bec ause the Germ ans  will take her .  
 
 
Well, anyway, s he was  a s eams tr es s  and worked for the Ger mans '
 
wives  and gir lfr iends.  Her 
hus band was  taken to the Rus s ian Arm y.  And s omebody notified her  that he was  taken POW.  So they 
s tarted living together .  And then when the Germ an woman c ame to her and s aid I need that dr es s 
imm ediately, tom or r ow is  the latest, they r ealized that there's  going to be a liquidation.  So my unc le 
took her  and her little girl and they took  them to the Sawins kis  without notifying.  Maybe they did notify 
before.  And my unc le s aid to the
 
--
 
to Mr .
 
Sawins ki, I have a r ing here, a diam ond r ing, and I'll give you 
the diamond r ing if you will let me and my friend, m y lady fr iend with the daught er, hide her e. Well, they 

agr eed.  And they wer e with us , s afe with us .
 
 
After the war , my unc le m arr ied that woman.  She was  pregnant with his  c hild and her 
hus band c ame.  He was  c aptur ed by the Italian contingent that fought on the Germ an s ide.  The 

Germ ans killed all the POWs who were Jews  but the Italians  did not.  So he c ame.  So this  was  another 
tr agic al s ituation of thes e tim es .  My unc le told her do whatever  you want to.  Bec aus e they wer e 
nor mal, loving c ouple.  She dec ided to stay with m y unc le.  But they were fr iends .  They went to 
Is r ael

> > Marc el Drim er:  With her  fir s t hus band.  He 
remarried.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.  In the little time we have left bec aus e we want to tur n to our  audienc e for som e 
questions
 
--
 
in the beginning we s aw the two photographs of the Sawins kis  that you had.  Thos e have 
jus t com e into your posses s ion.  Tell u
s  about that.
 
> > Marc el Drim er:  Right.  About three or four months  I got a letter fr om the Univer s ity of West Virginia 
that somebody wrote to them  asking how to c ontac t m e and als o the Holocaus t Mus eum .  They 

forwarded the letter s to me.  Ther e was  a young wom an from  Drohobyc z wr iting:  I am a daughter , a 
great gr anddaughter, of the Sawins kis.  My gr andmother, at the time you were in hiding, m y 
grandm other was  in Germ any, for c ed labor , for c ed labor  s lave.  
 
 
And after s he c am e s he learned
 
--
 
we didn't know
 
about this  wom an. We only knew about the 
four c hildren.  And this  was  one and then there was  another  one who was  m arr ied.  She was  s tudying 

his tory and was  working on her family's  s tory.  And s omebody told her about the Sawins kis
, t
hat ther e 
was  a little
 
boy.  They gave her m y nam e and s he Googled and she found m e, you know, at the 
Univer s ity ofWes t Virginia.
 
 
If you Google my name, ther e's  about 10 pages of links .  So it's eas y to find.
 
 
I started corr es ponding with her.  Ther e was  abs olutely no doubt that s he is legitim ate.  There 
ar e som e of the Sawins ki c hildren and gr andc hildr en live in Poland and s om e of them live in the plac e 
that m y par ents lived when they went to Israel.
 
I as ked them if they had photos  of the Sawins kis  
bec aus e the Sawins kis  ar e lis ted as  r ighteous among nations .  These are the people that helped the 
J ews  s ur vive with danger  to their own lives .  But they didn't have any photos .  So I ask ed Maria
 
--
 
the 
gir l's nam e is Mar ia
 
--
 
if she has photos.  And s he s ays , "I do."  And I said
 
I 
would really, r eally like to 
get thes e photos.  And she s end them to m e.
 
 
I didn't s ee the Sawins kis  s inc e 1944.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The firs t photos ?

Having no other  ques tions , I think we'll go ahead and wrap up our progr am.  I will turn back  to 
Marc el.  He will s tay on the s tage after he finis hes  up.  So, again, pleas e feel fr ee to c ome up and 
talk 
to him then.
 
 
I jus t want to s ay that what we wer en't able to c over here wer e obvious ly m any, many, m any 
details .  We would jump over  a year in jus t a c ouple of m om ents, a year in hiding, a year in the ghetto.  

And we als o did not talk about Marc el's  life living under  the Comm unists .  And in 1961 he was  able to 
leave, get out of Poland, c om e to the United States , and r eally begin a r emarkable life her e befor e Ania 
was  able to join him a c ouple of year s later.
 
 
On that note, I'm going to turn it back  to
 
you, Marc el.

bec aus e there are people and organizations  who c laim  that Holoc aust is  a hoax, that it never 

happened; that the J ews  made it up to get money fr

By listening to the stor ies of m y c hildhood you become witnes s es  als o.
 
 
We all have to fight the four  evil eyes :  Intolerance, injus tic e, ignoranc e, and indiffer enc e.  
Thos e are the r oots of man's  m or al c orruptions that followed Hitler and his  helpers  to c ome to power 

and tor ture and m urder m illions  of people he c ons idered not wor th living, not only J ews  but people with

dis abilities , gypsies , homos exuals , and many other groups .  Changing these behaviors  i
s  a path to 
pr eventing Holoc aust and genoc ides .  And this  is what the Holoc aus t Mus eum is all about.
 
 
About indifferenc e, I would like to r ead s omething that Pas tor  Mar tin Niemoller  s aid when he 
was  liberated in Dac hau.
