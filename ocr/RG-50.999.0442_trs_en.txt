>> Manya Friedm an: I was 13 years old when the war started, so Idon'thavemuch life 
experience. I had two young parents, two young brothers.  I had anormal life. I attended 
school in the morning, public school,and in the af ternoon Hebrew school.  Butf or some 
reason 
--
 
it was mentionedthat I was born inChm ielnik, in 
C
entral Poland, a very sm all town.  
Butfor som e reason my parents decided to move to a larger city. W as it f or business reason 

or education, whatever?  
I  
don't know. T he only thing is that the city was notf arf rom the 
Germ an border.
 
 
Should I tell? That was m y lif ebefore the war started.  It was a 
normal teenager's lif e with loving parents and relatives andall of that. 
 
 
A s I m e ntio n
ed
, we moved to Sosnowiec, which was notfarf rom  
the Germanborder. And September
 
1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland.
 
That evening m y 
parents and theirf riends got together to decide what to do.  Everybody was convinced that 
Hitler would be stopped before reaching 
C
entral Poland.  Certainly the big powers l
ik e  
England, France, Russia, and the UnitedStates will stop Hitler f rom continuing.
 
 
T he concept was also,if there is a war, m enwould be involved 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

and womenand children would be lef t alone.  Sothe mendecided to send the wives and 
children back to the sm all town.
 
 
T o tell you the truth, we were quite excited. W e would go back 
andm eetourf riends.  W e gotupthe next morning, dressed in our best clothing, and headed 
for the railroad station.W e were af raid that we wo
uld be separated from  m other, but somehow 
father managed toputus on the trainand we startedthe journey.
 
 
W etraveledf ive m iles, eight kilometers,to the next stop. The 
railroad tracks inf ront of  us
 
stopped.  You can't imagine the comm otion,not know
ing what to 
do. On topof  it, we had the packages. So we decidedto getoff the train.  Because we were 

af raid they m ight bomb the train. But we didn't know what to do with the packages.  I 
rem em ber som ebody stole,begging them to take thepackagesf rom
 
us. She decided we 
should walk back
 b
ecause we didn't know what to do. 
 
 
So Iassum e we were wearing new shoes.  By the tim e we got 
home,ourfeet were blistered. And we were tired.  But we were glad to be home together with 

father and inour own beds. 
 
Thething also was we thought that that's the worst
 
thing that 
would happentous. Little did we realize what lay ahead. 
 
 
T hen the war started on a Friday.  And Monday the Germ ans 
already were in our town.  Atf irst they cam ein and there was comm otion.
  
Som e people 
apparently were shooting at the Germ ans. The Germ ans took everybody outf rom  those 
buildings and shot everybody, even the people that were hiding in the bunkers.
 
 
In the afternoon they decided everybody should step outf rom  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

their houses. T hey selected the Jewish m en,m arched them  to a windowless, airless 
basem ent inthe city hole. T he 
rabbi 
m en should stepforward.  It so happened a rabbi was not 
am ong them . T hey said the rabbi should step forward or 10 Jews wouldbe killed.  So a
s I
 
m e nt i
oned,the rabbi was not am ong them
, b
ut anelderly Jew, in order to save 10 people, 
steppedforward.  He said thathe was the rabbi. T hey took him  out,beat him up, pulledout 

half  of hisbeard, and threw him  back intothe rest of the menand told themto
 
sing the 
m orning's prayer because they were all going to die.
  
So you can't im agine the expression on 
theirf aces when they heardthis. And in them eantim e,the Germ an soldiers were taking 
pictures andf ilm s and having a good tim e. Photography. 
 
 
Of co u
rse, all along they didn't get any foodor water.  They 
spent the night inthatbuilding.  In them orning they were m archedto one of thefactories in the 

neighborhood. W e brought f ood
, b
ut there was a tall wall around thefactory.  All we could do, 
throw
 
it over thef ence. 
 
 
Right awa y deportation started, selection started. The 
businessm en were put in jail.  Maybe som e of them  gotoutfor big bribes.  Others were 

executed.  And peoplewere sent out to work li ke cleaning the streets and what other labor 
they needed.
 
 
W e were standing at the gate waiting for others to com e out.  
Most of thepeoplealready left. W edidn't know what happened tofather, but we had to leave 
because it was gettingdark and we couldn't stay there any longer. 
 
Irem em ber how we 
walked 
home not knowing what happened tofather.  
I
t was alm ost like walki ng after af uneral because 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
8
 
we didn't know if we would ever seef ather.
 
 
I also rem em ber whenwe got hom e, above my parents' bed 
hung two big portraitsof them.  AndI rem ember standi
ng in f ront of  m y f ather's portrait like 
saying goodbye.  Because we thought thatthat's it. Buthedid come hom e later.  It seem ed 
they detained som epeople to build trains.  Butf rom that day on there was no peaceful 
m om ent. W aking up in the m orning in
 
your own bed was like a m iracle because you wentout 
andfoundoutthat your neighbors were taken during the night. And, of  course,all along 

already thedeportation started.
 
 
Actually, theGermans didn't call it the deportation. T hey called 
it " re se ttl
ement."  They told they were going to another place. T hey were even told they can 
bring cots and blankets.  But when the trainsleft, those item s were left behind. And when 

people cam e back, they told us where those transports went.  Notto 
resettlement
 
but to 
A u sch wit z.   

 
W etalk to you about the Holocaust because the Holocaust isa 
warning f or everybody.   It's not that it happened so many years ago you shouldnot think about 

it.  You notice, you cam e in here, the Holocaust Museum.  Any other m useum you 
go t o
, 
people represent scientificexperiences,arts. T hism useum  is trying to portray to you what 

hate and discrim ination and this horriblehuman being cando.  
 
 
It's hard tobelieve even for us how this couldhave happened in 
a country that was educated country, Nazis, i n the world. 
 
How canyou m urder som any 
people, thousands of people, and nobody interf ere?  Nobody says anything.  It's true
, t
he  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Germ ans' aim  was to execute all European Jews, which they did
; 
six m illion. Butthey also 
executed m illio
ns of others:  T he Pols, gypsies, Jehovah'sW itness,homosexuals,any race
, 
w
om en and children.T hey were not killed because of what they had done
 
but because of  who 
they were. 
  

 
W hen we thinkof m illions, we seea numberwith a lot of  zeros.  
But keep inm ind that all of those zeros represented som ebody:  a
 
husband, wif e, f ather, 
m other, sister, brother, child. T hat's why I still have ahard tim eto com prehend how this could 
have taken place. And that's why we're tr ying to teach you, like a warning, what can happen 
when we do not speakup, when we do not get involved.
  
 
 
T rue, asa group we are called Holocaust survi vors.  But each 
oneof us has a separate story, a different story. 
 
 
As it was m entioned before, I was born in a sm all town.  I was 
raised
 
by m y young parents. W hen they took m e, m y parents werestill at home.  It was ve ry
 
--
 
it was ver y hard
 t
o be separated. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Manya, eventually you would bef orced, with your fam ily,
 
into a ghetto. Tell us 
what that was likef or you and you
r f a mily.  
 
>> Manya Friedm an:W ell, as long as we were outside the ghetto,we would exchange
 
s om e  
personal things with non
-J
ews.  But once you were in the ghetto, you could not get out from 

the ghetto intothe ghetto without supervision. It was the Jewish religion that was supervisin g.  
Yes, there was made a Jewish divis ion of  supervisors, but they were  notthere tohelp the 
J
ews.  T he Germ ans gave out orders,andthe Jewish supervision were there to execute them
.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
S
o they were not there to help the Jewish.  And as I said, once wewere in the ghetto, wecould 
not getoutf rom  the ghetto or get in
 
to the ghetto.  So the hunger w
a s i
ndescribable.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e atone tim e thatonce you were in the ghetto, it was really 
im portant to be able to get work
,  
is that that really m attered in term sof  survival.  T ell usabout 
th a t.
 
>> Manya Friedm an:T he sonderkart, what the Germ ans called it, startedactually out by 1940, 
endof 1940. Abouthalfof the Jewish population was already sent awa y.  So Jews in our city 
startedtothinkof  ways  that they could be useful tothe Germ ans, like open shops,m ake 
unif orm s.  Be able to rem ain at hom e.  Of course, atf irst the Germ ans rejected it. 
T
hey didn't 
want to hear about it. But eventually they realized if  they stay, they probably m ight get big 

bribes and they won't be sent to thef ront. 
 
 
So in1941, thef irst shop opened.  And that's where I got 
em ploym ent, in that shop. 
 
To tell you thetruth, I wasn'tm uch of a seam stress but I was lucky.  
I was sitting between two ladies that were prof essional seam stresses.  Like everything in 

Germ any, you hadtohave a quota, you had to produce som any pieces.  Ihate to adm itI 
becam eprof icient enough I couldm ake the quota m yself . But in the beginning those ladies 
were helping m eout. The pay was m inim al. You couldnot survi ve.  
 
 
W e we r e t r yi n g t o  get
 
--
 
[Inaudible]. T he important thing was the 
sonderkart.  You call item ploym ent card.W e called ita way to lif e. Because inthe beginning 

if  theGermans caughtyou on the streetand you could provide that card, they would let you 
go.  But that was only for a while.  Because itlastedfor a while.

I m ight skip som e things.  But one day as ourshift was about to 
leave andthe other shift was waiting to take over, the SS surrounded the building and we were 
all takenf ordeportation.  T hey took us toa place.
 
 
Anyway, m y parents were still
 
athom eat that tim e, with m y two 
brothers. T hey cam eto the place where they keptus. W ecould not comm unicate
 b
ecause 
we were on the secondf loor and they were s tanding inf ront of the building.
  
Theonly thing I 
rem em ber, I rem em ber m y parents standing there and we were looking at each otherand 
probably assum ing that will the futurebe
.   W ill  
there be a f uture?
  
And another thing, we 
thought, will we ever see eachother?  Andas it turned out,that was the last tim e I saw my 

parents.  Andthey took and sent ustoa temporary cam p.  
 
 
Later thebuyers cam e to select us. W e were taken toa place
 
--
 
it was actually a brandnew place thatbelonged to private Germ ans.  It was a com pany that 
was also handling thegold that they conf iscatedf rom  the Jews, t
he golden teeth.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Sam ecom pany?
 
>> Manya Friedm an:T he sam e com pany.  And they were all instrum ental in productionof  
C
yclone B, which was usedagainst thepeople.  But it was abrand new cam p.  It was niceand 
clean. But af ter a while, asfar as life in camp, it was just likeany other cam p. W e were 

awakenedearly in them orning to be counted.  Andf or some reasonthey couldnever get the 
numbers right. W e were standingf or hours to be counted and recounted.  And then we went 
to work.
 
 
You see,most of the tim e youdidn't have tom ake any decision 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
in camp. But you still had todecide when you get in them orning apieceof bread, shouldI eat 
it all now or m aybe save som efor later? T hesam e thing was in theevening waiting f or the 
bowl
 
of  water, soup. Maybe I should try to get ahead andbe luckyenough to geta pieceof  
carrot or piece of potato, turnip or some luck. 
 
So although the cam p was new, clean, but the 
conditions were the same as inany other cam p. 
 
 
Af ew m onths later the SS
 
took us over. T hey installed barbed 
wi res. W ehad to go through showers.  Ourheads were shaved. W e were gi ven wooden 
shoes.  And naked
,  
we had to gothrougha bunchof  Gestapotohave our arm s tattooed.
 
 
I can't describe to you 
--
 
to this day I cannot
 
forget the 
em barrassment.  It'snot like now, girls weari ng bikinis.  In those days I didn't get undressed in 
f ront ofm y m other to take a bath. And that'swh y I say to this day I cannot forget it. 
 
 
T he sam e things, we had to get up inthe morning, wait
 
to be 
counted.  It lasted through January
 
1945. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Manya, tellus, at this camp that youdescribed, Gleiwit z, f irst it was run by a 

private Germ an com pany, thenthe Gestapo took itover.  Tell us about the work that youwere 
m ade to do ther
e . 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:W ell, for som e reason, you know, when If irstarrived, we were s
tanding 
in a row andthe German
 
overseer selectinggirls f or certain jobs. Now I speak,but I usedto 
be a very sh y young gi rl.  Sometim es I would hidebehind a tall person. Butf or som e reason, I 

don't know wh y, I was chosen to be in charge of  a group of girls.  I learned the procedure.  I 
co o ked  
--
 
the big shots, the Germ ans cam e. I don't know if the bosses wantedto show off that 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

they are educated aswell, but I knew ever yt hing, how the factory ran. I could draw you a 
picture. The shop was producing soot, carbon.  You see,everybody wondered what they were 
m akingf or carbon. T he Germ ans were in desperate need.  Becausef rom  it that they were 
m aking synthetic rubb
er
 a
ndf rom  rubber inthe tires f rom  which the m ilitary was running. 
 
It wa s a tf irst ha rd ,e
ven when the private com pany was running, and later when the SS took 
over
, b
ecause everything has to be counted. Ever ything had to bem easured. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And in this cam p, making this soot, I rem em ber youtelling me, Manya, that 

you would get every third Sunday off .
 
>> Manya Friedm an:Right.  Unless we work ed around the shift.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Every single day
 
--
 
>> Manya Friedm an:But Sunday, only get off the Sunday, if  you worked a double shif t.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Only if you had worked a double shif t that day.
 
>> Manya Friedm an:You had to work the Sunday a double shif t to get it.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson: W hatdid you typically do onthatone day you got off every three weeks if  you 
had worked thedouble shif t? 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:My best friend, checking each other's lice. Unfortunately you couldnot 
control them . That'show the sanitary conditions were.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And the work itself  was sodangerous.
 
>> Manya Friedm an:W ell, you see,all along we saw each other,how we looked outside, but 
af ter the war we f ound outhow thataffected our lungs.  Because we inhaled the soot. I was 
about three or f our m onths.  T hey arranged, the Swedish people, arranged like a s
an
a to
ri u m
.

T hey converted the school liketo a sana
to
r i um
. W e were kept there.  In the beginning I 
rem em ber we were lik e in a school.  In thef rontof  the school was
 
--
 
I d o
n't know what they 
hadthere, but peoplewould go out andpeople would bring in packages.  And there was a 
newspaper articlef rom the doctors not to give  us any f oodbecauseour lungs
 
--
 
we were not 
accustom ed to richf ood.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you would continue working, as you said,atthe Gleiwitz cam p in those 
conditions until January of 1945.  Andas theRussians began to getcloser, the Germ ans, the 
Nazis, decided it was tim eto takef rom  youthere. T ellus what they did with you then. 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:W ell, at that tim eI hada very hard decision to m ake.  My bestf riendwas 

gone
 
--
 
in the inf irmary.  AtfirstI decided I leave her there.  And theRussians were liberating.  
But there were cam p
s 
thatthey were going to burndown the cam p.So you can't imagine how 
we were.  And m yf riend happened to be very sick.  But we hadanotherf riend.  She lives now 
in New York
.  
I convinced the other f riend
 
--
 
between the two of  us, we took thatf riend out.
 
 
I have to explain why s he was in the inf irmary. T his was notan 
easy thing.  So we took her out.W e went tothe railroad station.  Each oneof  us got bread 
anda blanket. W e got to the station, but there was no train.  Idon'tknow if  som e of  you 
already went up to the permanent exhibit. You saw the railroad carupstairs. W ell, we went
 
--
 
we were not sent in cars like this. W e were sent in open cars
, t
he type that youtransferred 
coal.  And it was in January.  Believe m e, thewinter in Europe can get very severe.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that was anespecially severe winter.

in the cornerof  the car.  W ithm y handsI was holding on to the railing, and with m y back 
pushing away the crowd so she wouldn't be s
quashed. 
 
 
Should Iexplain aboutthe inf irm ary?
 
>> Bill Benson:  Mm
-
hm m .
 
>> Manya Friedm an:You see, youdidn't goto the inf irm ary if  youwere sick.  Because they'll 

send youaway.  If  youcan't work, they don't need you. T he thing was
 
--
 
that was already the 
second doctor. Because the f irst doctor wassentaway. W e had a lady that was pregnantand 

hada baby.  She was legally
 
--
 
she was m arried,and she was caught by the deportation. She 
was already pregnant.  But the doctor did notreport her, that
 
she was pregnant.  And it so 
happenedour barrackwas ri ght next to theirs.  Could hear through the wall what was goin g on.  
W hen she hadthebaby, right next to us was them en's cam p. And hef ound out that 
som ebody in our cam p had ababy.  So he cam e in, grabbed thebaby, and threw it against the 
wa l l
.  A
nd th
en 
the m other
 
an
d thedoctor wer e sent away because the doctordid not report.
 
 
So the second doctorhappened to be a French Jew.  He took a 
ver y great risk of  keeping m y f riend inthe inf irm ary.  Theonly excuse was we worked with 
soot. And any little cut or scrape, you got an inf ection. Sohe reported her, that shehad an 
infection. T hat's why he was sentaway.
  
And with this other doctor

actually, he didn't have 
any m edication.  All he had w

[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you
 
--
 
with your otherf riends, you were able toget Lolaout of the inf irm ary 
into theopen carsand then you were sentonthis trip in theopen cars in f reezing conditions.  
T ell us where the train went.  You were on the train in theopen cars. 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:Oh.  W e wentm aybe10 days back andf orth.W henever we went, the 

trucks.  Iassum ed they used the trucks to transport them ilitary or so.  W e were not given any 
food. T he snow thatfell on the blankets quenchedour thirst.
 
 
Laterf iguring out thatour destination was north, west, but we 
wound upfor som e reason in Czechoslovakia.  If  you know geography, C zechoslovakia is to 
the south. T he Czech people were ver y nice.  They came to the station wherever we stopped.  
W anted to give us some bread or water,butthe Germ an soldiers wouldn't let them. And they 
were even shooting atthem. Som etim esthepeople would go where there was an overpass 
and just throw som efood down to us. W e traveled like thism aybe 10 days.
 
 
It sohappened, the next car next to us wasf rom our cam p.  At 
oneof  the stations, she clim bedupon the railing with a tin cup andbegged the soldierfor 
som e water becauseone of the girls f ainted. And instead he pulledouthis gun
 
and shother.  
And shefelt down between thetwo trains. 
 
 
T hen we traveled like this until we landed in 
Ravensbruck
.   W e 
landed at night. They couldn't put on the lights because they wouldrealize.

>> Manya Friedm an:Right.  So some of us they put in the showers.  And knowing already 
what showers m eant, you can't im agine how we f elt. Som etim es rem iniscing about it, how we 
were sitting, holding on to eachother and likesaying goodbye.  T hat's it.  But som ehow we sat 
through thenight. T hen we saw the trucks and shades, we're still alive.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Manya, you describedtom e one time at Ravensbruck, where you were now, 

was trul y a hell. Tell us a littleabout Ravensbruck.
 
>> Manya Friedm an: 
 
W ell, Ravensbruck was a cam pthat was built
 
--
 
I don't remem bernow 
thenum bers.  I told you that Idon't rem em ber anym ore. Som ethings.  It was say f ive 
prisoners ineach barrack.  By thetim e we landedthere in 1945, it was maybe 10 times that 
m any prisoners.  So you can't imagine the sanitary conditions there.  You got up in the 
m orning. It was like a fountain,the rain
;  
all you could do was reachoutfor afew drops of 
water to apply to your face to wake up.
 
 
Again, the sam e as the other cam ps
:  s
t an
ding, standing for 
hours to be counted,to be counted.  But onething I remember
 
--
 
it'sfunny, som ethings stick in 
your m ind. You see, we were young. W e wanted to survi ve.  But som etim es you just wanted 
it to end.  You didn't care how.  You just wanted
 
it to end.  But I remem ber Ravensbruck was 
like every other camp.  Stood inthe line in the m orning to be counted.  And I rem ember we 

were standing
;  
we justwanted it to end. I wanted to survi ve.  And that time Ravensbruck had 
a crematorium . They were wheeling by carts with deadpeople, corpses. They were not 

clothed. T hey were just naked corpses. Only the skin was holdingthebones together. And 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

once in a while one of the corpses wouldfall off. T hey just picked it up and put itbackonthe

I remember saying to m yself, I'm  not going to wind up likethis. I must survi ve. W ell, in 
theother cam ps sometim es you just wantedto give up. 
 
 
T henf rom  Ravensbruck they sent us to a smaller camp which 
was a subcam pof  Ravensbruck.  Over there
 
--
 
you 
askedm e what Iwas doing in m y spare 
tim e.W e were sitting.  It was a Sunday. W ewere sitting, checking each 
o
ther's clothing and 
hair if you had any lice.  And one day, one morning as we were
 
--
 
it was a sm all cam p.  Aswe 
were standing tobe counted,one of the Germ an overseers walked up to our group and 
pointed theirf inger at the girls to stepf orward.  I happenedtobe among them . I thought, why 
m e?  How do Idiff erf rom  theothers? Because as I mentioned bef ore, a deportation never 
m eant
 
--
 
t h e y 
sent youaway, they don't needyou.  And all of a sudden a white truck appeared.
 
>> Bill Benson:  
Can 
I interrupt?
 
>> Manya Friedm an:  Please do.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell us what happenedthere, at this camp they had made you work 

there,
 
to o.  So  y
ou had upuntil thatpoint when you worried that they didn'tneed youanymore, 
you hadbeen working at the Re

>> Manya Friedm an:All kinds of things.
 
>> Bill Benson: W orking on airplanes? 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:  Cl
ose toanairplane place.  Not the large one.  But every tim e we were

selecting the bricks which were useable.

>> Manya Friedm an:From  the bom bed houses.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you toldm e
 
--
 
at that tim e, of  course, the war is com ing to a close,and 
thatone of your associations was watching the Germ ans reactto the allied planesf lying over.
 
>> Manya Friedm an:Yeah.  Most of  the Germ ans that were watching us atthat time were 
either old menalreadyor ver y young boys.  So every tim e there was analarm and aplane 
went by, they would lay down, covering their heads.  And we were laying and just looking up at 
the sky getting m ad 
that they don't do anything.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat they don'tbom b you.
 
 
So there youare, youget pickedout suddenly.  And you're 
worr ied, being of course, thatm eans you'reno longer needed. T ell us what happened then
, 

h
ow you were rescued at thatpoin
t. 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:  As I m entioned, they took us f rom the border
 
linef rom  the camp. There 
was a truck out there
, a
 
white truck.  It was mentionedtous to clim b upon thetruck. But we 
were so weak we just couldn't clim bup.  And all of a sudden oneof them  brought a cratefor us 

to step on the crate to get into thetruck. W ethought we were hallucinating.  Youneve
r  s a w a  
gesturef rom  the Germans. Later we found out why.  But when we got on thetruck we we re 
gi ven a carepackage
, g
i ven by the Red Cross, the Canadian governm ent. It wasf ood.W e 
didn'teven know what it was.  It was food. W e started to open.  It w
a s c
o coa  
and sardine
s
, 
m ilk powder, crackers.W e ate it all at once.Af ter all, it was food. W edidn'teven care if that 
was our last meal. Of coursem any of the girl s got sick, not being used to suchf ood.  And they 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

20
 
kept going in the truck.  W edidn't
 
even talk to each other.  Becausewe didn't know what the 
future will be. W illthere be afuture? And we traveled like thisuntil we landed in Copenhagen.
 
 
You see,that white truck was f rom  the Swedish Red Cross. W e 
landed in Copenhagen. We couldn't stay. T he Danish people werever y nice to us, gave us 
food and a place to rest but we couldn't stay in Denm ark because Denmark was under 
Germ an occupation. Then we went out of Sweden.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us the circum stance thatm ade itpossiblef or the Swedish Red Cross to 

c o m e i n t o R e
ch
linandget you. T ell us that story.  How did that happen? 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:T he story was at that tim etheSwedish director of  the Red Cross was in 

Germ any negotiatingwith Him m ler who was in charge of the Gestapo the releaseor the 
exchange of  Swedish
 
--
 
not Swedish, Norwegian or Danish P.O.W .'s.  And since it was theend 
of  A p r i l
 
1945, Himm lerrealized thatGermany has lost the war
; s
o insisted thathe should 
release some prisoners from Ravensbruck. And that's ho
w it a ll starte d . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And why do 
you 
think that you and af ew other Jewi sh wom en were included?
 
>> Manya Friedm an: I don't know why.  T he thing was, the 
m ain 
rescue was f rom 
Ravensbruck
 
becausethey rescued like 10,000 people. W e were just in a little truck.  But the 
rest of the people, they called white busesbecausepeoplef rom  Ravensbruck were on buses. 
 
But then when we came toSweden,that's another story.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what that was like. 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:  W e didn't believe
 
--
 
you can't com prehend it.  But we just couldn't 
believe that we were r eally f ree.  SometimesI say I was looking like a sheer curtain, like I

wasn't invol ved there.  Welooked around.  
ﬁ
Are  we  re
ally f ree?
ﬂ
  
And at night
 
--
 
they put us up 
in a school
.  E
ach oneof  us got am attress. But when you woke up at night, there was always 
som ebody at the window to m ake sure thatwe were really f ree. Of  coursethe 
sick o ne s the y 
took right
 
to the hospital
. 
 
 
Even when they directed us go totake a shower, som etimes a 
young lady f rom the Red Cross hadto go inand show us that water really comes out. It's ver y 
hard to describe how we felt. 
 
And,of  course, afew days later the studentscam e running up 
th e
 
s ta irs  ye llin g "
T hewar's o ver with,"  "Thewar's o ver."  W e didn't have pajam as or night 
gowns. W e slept in our underwear but who cares, the war was over . W e came running out in 
our underwear, hugging each other. Of  course you want to know if  som ebody 
from  the fam ily 
survi ved.
 
>> Bill Benson: What did you dof rom  Sweden, once you recuperated?  What happened to 

you then?
 
>> Manya Friedm an:T he Swedish people were very nice to us. They provided jobsfor us.  
And since I made uniform s f or the Germans, w
hich have to be very particular, I got a job as a 
seam stress
 i
nSweden.  And at night I was going to school.  Andactually I was learning 
E n glis h

>> Bill Benson: W hendid you leave Swedenf inally?
 

>> Manya Friedm an:Five and ahalf  years. Bec

Ihad to wait for thePolish quota.

Poland, there was abig dem and.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us, why did
 
yo u
 
want to com e tothe United States? W hatm ade that your 
destination? 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:T his is another story.  At that tim ethere was what we called 
[Indiscernible]f rom Israel, encouraged us togo to Israelalthough itwas not little transportation
 
b
u t  s t ill.  B
utI rem em ber it so happenedm y fatherhad a sister in the United States.  At the 
turn of the century.  Becausehe was the youngest.  She was theoldest. And his sister 

encouraged our parents to com e tothe United States.  But in thosedays my mother was 
against it because inthose days it was not like now, you jump on aplane and you're therein a 
few hours.  You leftand you never saw your r elatives again.  But they keep still responding, m y 
father and his sister.  And m y f ather would read tous the letters. They were all so
 
wa rm .  So  I 
decided since I don't have anybody
;  
I'll cometo the United States.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you remember her address? 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:No.  I read in the Jewish newspaperf rom  New York about another 

relative.  Because we
 
were reading all kinds of papersand bitsof  news to f ind somebody.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So using the Jewish newspaper in New York is how you were f ound
 
--
 
>> Manya Friedm an:Found som ebody else
, a
 
relative of the person I was lookingf or. And 
actually she thought there was another person by the same name as m ine.  And shethought

do we have another hour?

at thebeginning I 
was ver y m adatm y father.  Butthen I realized m y parentsm arriedfor love.  Becausethe 
otherperson that I met toldm e whathappened. T he older brother andm y f ather separated 
theone line andm y motherand the little brother in another line.  But father didn't want to be 
separated.  So he crossed over.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He went over with your m om? 
 
>> Manya Friedm an:At first, as I say, I wasm ad atfather. Butthen I thought back
 
and 
thought aboutthe life at hom eand I realized that they loved each other. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Manya, we have a littletimethat we could get some questions f rom our 
audience. Should we do that?
 
>> Manya Friedm an:  Sure.

were at Ravensbruck, if you had any observations about thef emaleguards that you 
experienced.
 
>> Manya Friedm an:T o tell you the truth, we were tryin g to stay awa y f rom them , not tohave 

contact with them . The f em ale guards,besides walking around with a stick, they also walked

itm akes it worse because you're constantly thinking about 
it.  Do I 
forgi ve the Germansfor what they did to me andm y f am ily?  No. 
 
 
You see,I don't know ifI'm  rightor not, but Ihave those two

t o  scho o ls.   
They have foreign students. Therotary club, you mentioned.  He said he's a 
Germ an.  He was 5 years old when the Holocaust was.  Anyway, he wants to apologize.  You

in d ivid

ca m p

if  you're cooped up, you got up inthem orning, it was gone. You see, we didn't have

people.  B
ut
 
m ost of the time we

, 
Lola 
rem ained yourf riendfor the rest of your life.
 
>> Manya Friedm an:Right. W e still call each other. She lives in Israel.  I visit her about six 
tim es. She was hereonce. W eare still very close. The way we m et, she was clim bing upone 
endf rom the bed, whatever you call it, and I was clim bing up on theother. We didn't know 
eachother.  And she introducedherself , " I'm Lola."   I said," I'm  Manya."  From then we 
bec
am e very close.

 v

young people
 b
ecause young people are thefutureof  this country.  Andfortunately we li ve in a 
country where we do have a voice, we can speak up. It's the best country in the world, even 

with all the shortcom ings.  So I can say the sam e to you, a little older. 
 
 
Please speak up when you see injustice.  Don't treat the others 
like your enem y.  Be considerate. Don't judge peopleby the color of their skin or their religious 
background. 
 
Ibelievein you, that you'll take the history of the Holocaust, come anywhere, 
anytim e. W ehave to be on the lookout.
 
 
T hank you very m uchfor com ing and listening to m e.
