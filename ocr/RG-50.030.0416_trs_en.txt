A: Yeah, my name  is Andrei Rosenberg, and I 
was born in Uszhorod, that time  when I was born 
was belonging to Czechoslovakia until 1938. In 1938 
was a deal between Germany, England and 
France, and they took it, Czechoslovakia as a [i
ndecipherable] and Uszhorod, they give  it to the 
Hungarians, who were there before. And [indeciphe
rable] was -- it was Hungary this Uszhorod is 
ca -- the name  of the city is [indecipherable] in Hungarian language. 

Q: What was your native language? When 
you were born, what was your first language? 
A: My first language was Hungarian. And -- b
ecause my mother was speaking Hungarian, my 
father not. Let me tell you about my close relativ

Rosenberg. He came as a teenager, when he 
was 13 year old, to [indecipherable] trans-
Carpathian, because it was a war in 19 -- with 
-- the first World Wa r. And the Russian Cossacks 
made some anti-Semitic riots and other things, a
nd they just  decided to come  to Uszhorod, which 
was Russian -- the Russians couldn™t pass the Carp
athian -- pass the mountains, so they came to 
start a living --

away from the Czechoslovakian and Polish border. 
And that time, ma tter of fact, this 
-- it was belonging -- Galicia was it.

Q: And the name  of the village was? 

A: Sokoliki, where he was born. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Besoke Sokoliki. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So my fa ther was an orphan. Wh en my grandm
other got -- gave birth to a second child, she -- 
she got an infection, she died, she 
-- my father was one 
year old only, and that second child died, 
too. So my father, when he was three, four 
year old, he was already looking for her -- the 

[indecipherable] to be -- ge
t --get feet in everyt hing
 [indecipherable] child -- 
Q: He was looking to [indecipherable]

and five mor e  children with -- from t he second 
marriage, which got very good education, they all 

-- an -- and he, as an orphan, the stepmother 
didn™t take care of hi m like she should. And my 
mother be -- come  from a Hungarian Jewish fami
ly. She -- she was an orphan too, and she -- she 
became an orphan when she was 17 year old. She was the oldest daughter. And she got three

brothers and two sisters. A
nd she was looking [indecipherable] how long she get ma rried in 
1923. And these children grew up and they
 start to take care of each other. 
Q: Was she from Uszhorod? 
A: She -- she was born in Uszhorod in 1903, yeah. And -- 

Q: What was your home  life like?  When you were 
growing up, what was your life like pre-war? 
A: I was a ha ppy child because I was very hel-hea
lthy, and I liked to pl ay 
soccer, and my parents 
take care very well of us, despite this -- was 
economi cally very tough that time , and we weren™t 
rich, really. 

Q: Did both your parents work? 

A: No. My mother got, besides me , four more children. 

Q: Wo-ho. 

A: And she couldn™t work, my father was work
ing. W- W- What is different between me  and 
usual -- usual ta -- people or occasions this happen -- this happens to be -- this -- my -- my father, 
he was born in Poland, and he 
couldn™t get his citizenship. 
Q: This would be in Czechoslovakia? 

A: In Czechoslovakia and then in Hungary, the ci
tizenship. And my mother, she -- she -- she was 
a [indecipherable] she got a citizenship, and they 
got already the five children, I was the oldest, 
this was in ™41. So these people in my town st
arted to suffer when -- in 1944 when the Germans 
occupied, and we got three extra years we suffere
d, because they took it -- my -- my father, and 
they decided -- they decided this -- we  have 
no roof over our head. We
 ha ve children, like the 
youngest was eight month old. 

Q: And wha t  year this wa s, 19 -- 

A: In 1941.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: He was eight year -- I mea
n, eight months old. The oldest 
was -- I mean, the next one was 
three year older than hi m, and I not -- the -- the si
ster -- I got two sisters, 
one I still have it. The 
youngest sister, she was three year 
older -- she was about in -- in 
-- she wa s born in ™34, and this 
was in -- in -- in ™41, she was s -- 

Q: Seven. 

A: -- six and a half, seven year old. And I will ne
ver forget, she said -- because my o -- p-parent s 

got a -- an auction to -- to let a
ll go with your father, or stay w
ith your -- with the mother all 
together. If we would go with my father, 
we -- we would get killed in communist 

[indecipherable] in -- in -- 
in -- right away, in 1941.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Like my -- my father did get -- he -- he never -- 

Q: Yes, in 1941. 
A: -- he ne -- yeah, he never returned. He -- he --
 he -- they killed him. They just shot them and -- 
and -- and -- and throw them in -- 30,000 people in 
the Dnieper -- in the Dniester river, in the 
Dniester river. And so he never came back, my father. Economi cally it was very hard because he 
was the only one who was working. 

Q: What was his occupation, 
what wa s his profession? 
A: He was a mover. 

Q: He was a mover? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: That is, he would mo ve furniture, he would move -- 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah --

Q: -- household goods and so on? 
A: -- he -- he -- he got -- he got two horses 
and a wagon. He was a very strong ma n and they 
always ma de joke of him, they s -- nobody can 
compete with him because if somebody should 
charge for moving some thing, he should [indeciph
erable] another helper, and he could do for -- 

the job for two, he got so much strength. So he 
take it one side, and two 
other people the other 
side. And really was a physic
ally very, very strong ma n.  
Q: Do you have any favorite me mori es of your
 father, of your childhood growing up, seeing him 
work, seeing your parent™s home and so on? 

A: Yeah, we -- we got the ritual 
dinners, Friday and Saturday di
nners. My father, he liked very 
much his children. He was very strict if you di
d some thing wrong, but he took care. God forbid if 
some body, a n adult or  a neighb -- ne ighbor would t
ouch you, he was in trouble, because he said, 
I have my children, I will punish them more 
than you do, but don™t raise your hand in my 
children. 
Q: So you fe lt protected. 
A: He protected us. 

Q: And you -- and -- 

A: And I was too, I -- I di dn™t -- nobody bothers me
 too muc h, because I -- I learned from hi m. 
And I couldn™t compa -- co-complain to him. 
He  said, you have no hands
 [indecipherable] why 
you do?  He hit me . So hit him back. That tim
e was a different time, no -- no -- nobody carry a 
knifes and guns, you know, they said, oh, with -- with your fi sts, you couldn™t kill with your fists 

other child, anybody. So my father stop at -- he -- he
 -- he went -- the horse
s left, and the -- the -- 
the wagon left and I was 14 year old and I took over
 these things. I 
quit school and I started to -- 
to partially f-feed my -- my fa mily. Plus --

Q: This is -- you know, I™d like to come  to this poi
nt, but in order for -- in order from some one in 
the future to understand what happened. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: They™re not that fami liar with both the situ
ation in Czechoslovakia about the change of 
Czechoslovakia to Hungary and so 
on. So we™d like to talk a l
ittle bit about before 1941, what 
life was like, what the situation was like in Uszhorod. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And a bit about the Jewish community in
 Uszhorod and then when all these changes 
happened. 

A: Alright. 

Q: That will ma ke more sense. It will -- peopl
e will understand, because for them Usz horod is a 
foreign, different pl ace. 

A: Yeah. So -- 
Q: So -- so perhaps we can -- you could tell us alittle bit more about -- about what the -- was 
your fa mily a re -- was a religious family?  Di

didn™t look at the chi --  the children til three 
months, he didn™t want to -- 

Q: He didn™t want to see the child? 

A: -- s -- s -- play with them, but like a -- but when

 always got one child on his laps, the smallest, 
who -- who -- but he should be at least six m
onths old. How beco -- youngest become  six month 
old, he got. And sure, that time  everybody was re
-religious. And jus -- Czechs -- Czechoslovaki a 
was a demo cratic country.

Hungarians. They -- they started 
not to take to the [indecipherabl

working camps [indecipherable] people. And this 
was a -- we feel the di fference in the --

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So it didn™t change too much. I -- I switch
 it to Hungarian school
. My native language was 
Hungarian, so it di -- didn™t affect me  too much. 
Th-The -- th-the affecti

sn -- he -- as you mentioned before, because he 
had never had citizenship -- 

A: That™s right.

Q: Carpathian Dukla pass 
A: Yeah. We -- we went to Nowy Sacz was the fi

 at age 40, Mengele would set her 
between the workers, and ma ybe
 she™ll survive, ma ybe not. 

Q: So tell me  about that, when the train opened,

because certain people was working and they somehow get connected with each other.

A: No, no. Were -- people were di fferent, fr om my age and up until 50 ma ybe. [indecipherable] 

but h-he was in a good shape. Let me  tell you, a mi
racle happened to me  over there. There was a 
Dr. Orlich, a Czech doctor, and he -- he got authority because  the German™s families were zi -- 

living in th -- in -- in -- in blocks over there,
 outside, and he was like a 
family doctor to them. So

look at the muscles and 
how the n -- if some body was too weak, he took th

And when he meet -- mi ssed me , I made a sour 
face. He said, what, you
™re not happy?  You want 
to go?  I said, sure. I di dn™t know -- they were [i
ndecipherable] were telling this, they go for a -- 

easier work, for a better work. And this Orlich jump
ed right in the mi ddle, He said, leave him, he 
said. This is the only Hungarian
 Jew who never ever attended 
the -- the -- the -- the hospital 
[indecipherable] or any -- and 
never was sick, he can work. A
nd I was saying, what a son-of-a-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416

gun, a Jew, and he -- he  -- he -- he -- he doesn™t 
want m- my l i fe ma ke a little easi er, and he saved 
my life. He knew it. He knew it exactly becaus
e he was an insider.
 He knew it exactly. 
Q: When did you know it? 
A: Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, I find out later -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- much later. I don™t know when, but I find ou
t that he saved my life, Dr. Orlich. He would 
be hundred year old if he would live. 

Q: Did you ever know what ha
ppened to him?  Did he -- 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: A s mall world. Again, I got something with

tion, right -- right here
 -- here is -- 
Q: I see, mm-hm. 

A: -- and he clean it out, this, a

e -- the hallway. So I -- I would 
wash the hallway and when -- in the mi ddle he 
says, come  on on the table. He give me  some  
opium. He took so long to put me  asleep, he said, what are you, a horse or some thing?  And then, 

when I -- he finished, I jumped from t he bed dow
n, and I went to the hallway to finish to -- 
where you are going, he said. I sai
d, I just -- just stopped to wa sh
 the hallway, I go finish it. I 
says, I have a job, that -- he said, you reme mber th
at?  He said, you are a hors
e. In -- in this small

world what I said, when I was in Israel, my uncle 
got a surgery and I told this story, and the wife 
said, Dr. Krause, was he red-haired
? He was red -- he was from this
 city?  Yes. He said, he ma de 
the surgery in the 50™s here, to your uncle. Small world. 
Q: Very sma ll world. Very small. 

A: Very -- I ra -- I give you more small world later. 

Q: Okay, okay. So -- 

A: So -- 

Q: When we  go back again to when that -- when
 you say the German engi
neer found -- told them 
to give you another job. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What was that? What  was the -- what were you -- 

A: Just clean the -- with a [indecipherable]  

Q: But you were inside the coal mi ne? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Inside the coal mi ne. 

A: Yeah, what else in the coal mi ne. The coal
 -- the -- from the coal mi ne is raining. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And you become  so wet in January and Dece
mber and how long you ma rch to the -- to the 
camp, it was a half a mile is -- is like bones, 
is frozen. I never sneezed. [indecipherable]. You 
become  sometimes, you know, so s-strong that you 
wouldn't believe it. Many people just came  a 
-- and once -- once a Russian -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- a Russian prisoner of war, hewas in this camp too, he escaped.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416  
29 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: With the civilians. So they 
were -- they -- they -- they 
-- they were looking for him a nd 
counted us again and again and again. I was thin
king a -- in this cold place, in [indecipherable] 
they call them appelleplatz -- 

Q: Mm-hm, oh yeah, ap
pe l l e pl a t z ,  mm- h m.  
A: And in the appelleplatz, in --in the -- I wa

en I just survived.  
Q: It sounds that first of 
all you had very strong health. 
A: Yes. 

Q: That that helped you. 

A: It helped me a lot. 

Q: And -- 

A: Besides that -- 

Q: Mm-h m?  
A: Besides that, they -- they did love me , peopl
e. I was lovabl e to them, because anything they 
asked me , I did it. I never argue, 
and I didn™t got enemies, it is ve
ry important. I -- I go -- I -- I 
afraid we gonna mi ss a very important parts. 
Q: This is a very important part. 

A: We are still in --  in --  in 
-- in -- in -- in the co
ncen -- in the concentration camp. Then remi nd 
me  how did I escape, how did -- 

Q: Oh yes, oh we come  to that, yes, we will. How you escaped. 

A: How I escaped and -- 

Q: But this, what you™re talk
ing about now, I think, is also very important, how some body 
survives. It™s -- also depends 
on how others react to them.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416  
30 
 
 
A: Yeah, but beca -- well, for example,
 was a -- was there a Pan Traibush.

day he brewed for himsel
f, he was about 60 year 
old ma n, he breweded him two pieces 
of bread with -- with schmaltz. 
Q: With fat? 

A: With fat. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And whe n he sit down to eat he 
always handed me  one, and he eat one. 

Q: Wo w. 

A: Every single day for months. And he™s a 
second one like Dr. Orlich who saved my life. 

Q: So he was the second Dr. Orlich for you. 

A: That™s right. And I didn™t forgot when I c 
-- escaped and I c -- was going home , I ma de five 
[indecipherable] five extra miles to meet this
, and tell him [i ndeciphe
rable] and kiss his hand. 
And he said, Andrei, here is a bread, he said, 
got how much you want. Isaid, I ashame , I can™t 
eat all this br ead. You give me  better a b -- you gi ve
 me a bi-bigger pi ece th
an I ha -- I will take 
it. And he got me  -- he gived me  the -- the br
ead to eat, and I got mo
re bread with -- from 
another resources and I went to 
the concentration camp, and I left 
with him and I told him thank 
you. 

Q: This Pan Traibush, wa s he a prisoner? 

A: No, he was a civilian.

Q: So what was his job in the -- in the camp?  
A: He -- he -- he was a coal mi ner, a real coal mi ner. 

Q: Oh.  

A: He was a real coal mi ner. 

Q: So in a way can you say -- i-is it what you™re
 saying is that he ke
pt you alive by giving you 
that pi ece of bread all the time? 

A: Definitely. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Definitely. And whe n I was coming back, a Ge
rman prisoner of war, 17 year old guy like me , 
he see it -- he was in the same  ca mp and I was, but they divided the camp in two. In one, I was -- 

I was going for the first one, certa
in people was sick and they di
dn™t go with us for the ma rch 
when [indecipherable]. I want to know what 
happened to them. They survived, nobody touch 
them. And - -  and -- and -- and the 
Germans lo -- run away and they 
were alive. And th-the other 
[indecipherable] the other half, they were Germ
a n prisoners of war. 
And to the fence came a 
German 17 year old boy like me  and he -- he gave
 his hand, he s -- ask me  for a piece of bread. I 
break it and I give it to him. And people was tel
ling me , some  people, that you™re crazy, he just 
killed [indecipherable] your people and -- and [i
ndecipherable] not he. 
He didn™t kill. I don™t 
know what he did, you don™t know what he did. Y
ou can™t s -- you can™t say 
what he did or how 
long, you don™t see it. I survived with help of Ge
rmans, Polish people and others, so it was my 
due to ma ke him survive. I -- I didn™t know that
 he is a murder or some thing. Wa s a kid, who 

was drafted to the army. He couldn™t say Hitler, 
no I™m not going, he would shoot him. You can™t 
judge -- you know, you got people like that
, you got people -- you 
know, you cannot unify 
people, th -- ba -- or go by -- 
by nationality or by religious. Th
at™s not the right way to do.

Q: I want to ask you something 
that™s a little harder to ask. 
You -- you™re me ntioning people who 
helped -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and who helped you survive and how you 
helped some body else survive. Did you also 
experience people who betrayed you?  Did you, either in Uszhorod before 1944, or afterwards 

when you were in the camp
s, did you also see that? 
A: No -- no adult. 

Q: No adults. 

A: A -- children I -- I -- I -- I

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: I see it once, a -- a young ma n was beating up
 an older Jew. I was ma ybe 12 year old. I took a 
couple of stones and I threw it on him who was atta
cking a-and I knew it he won™t catch me , he 
was trying to, but I was -- know I-I-I
™m faster. And this o -- that -- that time  this Jew escaped. I 
bring down -- that™s the way I 
could bring down, you know. But if some body -- to me , most of 
the people I would say, schoolma tes and others, we
 -- we got strong relationship, even when I 
returned and before, bec -- I got friends.

Q: That was another question th
at I wanted to ask about your 
pre-war years. We re you -- when 
you grew up, did you grow up in the Jewish community, or did you integrate with Hungarians? 
Did you go to -- did you have friends who were not Jews? 

A: My best friend was that time  a Jew guy.

Q: Hungry. 

A: -- hungry. I didn™t eat too much because I was s

long. The next day they put us agai

we were standing more than -- than we was 
going. They needed for somebody the -- the -- the 
train, they say, get out, get in, you know [indeciphera

then for that, then for that . 

Q: It sounds like chaos. 
A: It was, yes, it wasn™t in no -- they -- they didn™
t got a plan like that, it just turn out that way. 
And [indecipherable] this was the main point,

A: At the back end of the train, and I was in 
the mi ddle and I was thinking I should escape too, 
because I want to ma ke it. And I came  up with 
an idea this, I gonna play dead. I laid down near 
the -- the railroad, and I s -- s -- was waiting wh
en some body will come , I stop my breathing and

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And then he went to the other side agai
n to his friend, and he -- he didn™t go down and up 
from the other side of the train, he sent 
two bullets in my direction. And, because he 
[indecipherable] lay down, I could see with one eye,the ricochet. And then he la -- they left, and 

I was thinking, that™s all -- all takes to die?  I™m 
not feeling like I™m dead, I started to move. I™m 
not dead. 

Q: Did the bullets hit you? 

A: No. No, I wasn™t even -- 

Q: Yeah, uh-huh 

A: -- nothing. And then I get up, and when I heard noi
ses, they -- they -- they
 are shooting in this 
direction, I moved a little 
to the left, or to the right. I was 
oriented [indeciphera

where the SS, who -- who hunting people is.

surviving [indecipherable] too much. 
Q: And they were continuing, and so they we
re telling them march. 
And if some one didn™t 
ma rch, they shot them on the spot? 

A: If some body said he can™t ma rch -- 

Q: No, if he can -- 

A: -- he™s unable ma rch, then he -- 

Q: -- if he™s unable to march th
en they shoot them on the spot.

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- from t hat direction. 

A: In the f -- in the forest already. 

Q: Okay, in the for -- so you were in the forest -- 
A: I went to the forest then.

A: What?  How long I was walking? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I walked every day approxima tely 20 kilome ter,
 which is about 10 - 12 miles, and after that I 
was looking for a place to ask to stay over, a
nd a little food. And people didn™t de ny it in the 
villages. In city, in Kraków they didn™t let me
 use the toilet without --
 b-because I didn™t got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416

money to pay. In the villages, people are good. Ever
ything they got a little pat -- katorshka, was 
potatoes or some thing. 
Q: Potatoes, mm-hm.  

A: They share it with you. They give you a place, and you were staying overnight. Kraków, I -- I 

just get by by Kraków, because -- I told

[indecipherable] city in your apartme nt, or 
-- or nobody will open you the door. And I did -- and 
I understand that, and I did it in th
 -- in the villages. So I would 
say, if I walked about 500 miles -
- I mean, kilometers, I was walking maybe about -- cl
ose to -- I would say cl
ose to about three -- 
almost three weeks. Two and 
a half til three weeks maybe.

A: Yeah. 

Q: It™s -- not even a year ha
s gone by and it seems  like the worl

you were taken from Hungary -- 

A: Yeah, yeah.

Q: Yes? 

A: And they said this boy is a Jewish kid that
 the -- the parents get shot, killed, and he -- the 
German offi cer who was the comma nder of this -- this little town, he took him and he keeped

into this family. 

Q: My goodness. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Now that -- 

A: A beautiful little child that the Germans, they
 j-just -- when they were
 killing people, they -- 
they -- they -- he -- they were just felt sorry for 
him, they didn™t want to see him dead, and they -- 
they raise him for -- for two years. Yeah. And 
th-then, when I passed the -- passed the first 
village was Hanushofser, in Slovakia. 
Q: Hanushofser, mm-hm. 
A: Yeah, in Slovakia. This was already Slovakian
 territory, after the Dukl

it™s not -- I shouldn™t mi ss it, I wa
s going from Kraków in the vill
ages, I knock at the door to a 
woma n. She  let me  in, she feed me , and then
 her husband -- husband, her son, a 25 year old 
strong guy, came in. He ask, who is that?  He said
, a Jewish guy who escaped [indecipherable]. 
He took the -- the butcher knife and he want to
 stab me . The mother was standing between us 
and she said, run. I know hi m, he -- he -- when he -- he -- he is drunk, he is crazy. He  was crazy, 

but not that crazy. I did 
not [indecipherable] too much, he wa
s stronger than I am, he could kill 
me  any ti me  he want to. I -- I just, without hurr
y, I just walked out. And 
I see the next -- across 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416

the street is another house, a cele
bration. I came in in th
is place, they didn™t know where to put 
me . And [indecipherable] th-the be

She came wi th me , she buyed me  a -- the ticket, sh
e gave me  some  zlotys [indecipherable] but I 
couldn™t use it then, no more train. [indecipherable
] was 20 kilome ter, and I continued to walk. 
And what -- what -- what -- a different  -- 

Q: Why is it that you couldn™t 
use the -- the --
 the train?   
A: Because they didn™t run. 

Q: Ah, sorry. Of course. There were no 
trains that were running, of course. 
 A: [indecipherable] doesn™t run.  

Q: Of course, mm-hm. 

A: [indecipherable] Kraków was running 
20 kilome ters. Then I didn™t find anyone. 

Q: But you say, what a difference between the one and the other. 

A: Between peop -- one -- one didn™t know where to
 put me , and he -- he was ready to -- to do 
anything for me , and the other was kill me , so how 
-- how will we put this together? It ™s hard to 
put together? 

Q: It™s very hard to put together.

asked me , are you clean?  You have nothing -- 
you change clothes or some thing, 
[indecipherable] and I should give you some  other things. Yes, 
I™m clean, I know that I™m clean. And she feed

Never ever. I don™t want to see this house, and I 
didn™t want to inherit th-this house. My father 
was working hard, he was crying when he was 
leaving. But I don™t know -- 
I don™t want to see 
this house. I was in Uszhorod for years, and I neve
r went to -- to this 
house, never, ever.  
Q: So, but if you wanted to, you would have a 
claim on the house. You™d have a -- a right -- 
you™d have the property right

A: Yeah, it was a little house,
 not a big [indecipherable]

Q: What did -- what did you start doing when 
you --when you came back to Uszhorod, and you 
at least had a place with your moth
er™s cousin, how did life proceed? 
A: I -- I -- I didn't -- I didn't got pl

 go to the border [indecipherable] and they caught me  and they 
gave me  one  year probation for that.They left -- let me  off of the hook. 

Q: And this was in what year? 

A: In ™46.

A: Yeah. 

Q: Because you know, between East and We st Germ

A: Not there. 

Q: Not there. 

A: No. 

Q: And how is it that -- when did it become part

Q: Yeah, okay, Soviet Union, 
Soviet Ukraine, mm-hm. 
A: -- Soviet Ukraine. It -- it was some times in 
August, I think, or June
 or August 1945. And they 
still keeped the border open for a 
half a year, some thing like that. 
Q: Mm-hm. How did that happen?
 I mean, how did you f
eel it?  As I asked before, when -- when 
it went from Czechoslovakia to Hungary in 1938, 
how did it affect your daily life?  When it went 
from Hunga ry to Soviet Union -- 

A: No, I -- I didn™t -- was thinking 
to stay in Hungary. I 
just needed to get 
out from the  Soviet 
Union -- 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416  
66 
 
 
A: -- and then from Hungary I would go to
 America, to Australia, to anywhere. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: I didn't -- I didn™t -- I wasn™t 
planning to stay over there. So th
ey -- they -- they got me , and -- 
and they holded me f -- until 19 -- four months
, ma ybe, they were questioning me . It was 
[indecipherable] too, when they gave me  this year
 probation. And then they draft me  to the army 
in 1947, where I was more than three 
years, more than three years.  
Q: That™s a long time. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: And whe r e did you -- where did you serve, in
 the same  area, or 
in different places? 
A: What? 

Q: Just asking, post-war, what happened after -- 

A: I -- I -- I -- I was -- I was 
serving first in -- in Lvov.

A: Then in Wl adi mir- Wolynsk.

east?  No, th -- I™m thinking -- 
A: No, that™s here.

A: This is very close to Belarus from -- from Poland. 

Q: Ah, mm- h m.  

A: And Lubomol, in the same area. From the 
beginning to the end I was over there, yeah.

Q: And -- and your job, what was your job?  What

Q: 1973. When did you give in your application 
to leave?  Wa s it in 1973, was it a few years 
before?  

A: No, what, to leave? 
Q: Yeah, to -- 
A: 1973.  

Q: Oh, so you didn™t have to wait very long. 

A: If you would ask -- 

Q: You had to wait -- you had to wait

or so, but no -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. I was applying in ™72. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I was applying. 

Q: That™s what I was asking. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416  
68 
 
 
A: And then they would let me  in ™73, in a six months, some thing like this. They didn™t let me  go 
too easy too, but they let me  go. 
But I -- I was very pushy. I said 
I have to go. They ask me  why, 
I said because I don™t like anti-Semitism. Said, we
 don™t have here anti-Semitism. I says, you tell 
me ?  And he said, if you think here 
is such -- th-the -- the chief of 
the -- of it, he said, if you think 
here is anti-Se mitism, I can make you a Ukra
inian. I can change your name, your passport, 
everything. I -- I -- I -- I asked hi
m, who are you, a Russian or Ukrainian? He said Ukrainian. If 
some body would offer you to change to a Russi
an, would you do that?  He  said no. Why you -- 
why you ma ke -- offering me  some thing to
 do while you wouldn™t -- wouldn™t do it? 
Q: And wha t  was his answer? 

A: He -- he -- h-he --  

Q: He had no answer. 

A: He swallowed that. And then they let me
 go. [indecipherable] I™m -- I™m not coming down 
and pushing and pushing, they let me  off the hook. 
Q: Now we come  to questions that are a little 
bit harder to phrase, but
 the ones -- we™ve talked 
about them in some  point. You went through -- 
you went through so much and in a short period 
of time, but as I said, your wo
rld turned upside down. What woul
d you want Uri or Natasha, or 
your grandchildren to understand about what you 
went through?  What would you want them to 
r e me mb e r ?  
A: This I know, this life is not 
easy and they got a father who wa
s thinking about them, to ma ke 
their life a little bet -- be
tter than he got one. And why -- why 
-- why I -- I -- I wanted that they 
know, because if I won™t let them know, 
nobody gonna give [indecipherabl e] nobody would -- 
her -- heard this, and nobody 
would -- would know this. And this was my decision. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416  
69 
 
 
[indecipherable] I™m al most 75 year old, it can ha
ppens some -- some thing with me , and I take 
with me  in the grave. What don™t ma ke t
oo much sense. We s
hould learn by history.  
Q: What would you hope 
people would learn? 
A: Hm?  
Q: What would you hope 
people would learn? 
A: What people have to learn, if they have a ha
rd life like I did, they le
arn. I™ll give you an 
example. I told you that they liked me, ma ny peop
le from this, I was very -- open up my heart. 
[speaks foreign language here] I don™t know. You 
don™t know?  [inaudible reply] No, staff, chief 
of staff or some thing. 

Q: Yeah, mm-hm. 

A: Correct? Chief of staff and -- and -- wh
ere I was working. And he was a nice ma n. 
Q: Chief of staff in the -- in Sovi
et Ukraine now, you™re talking about? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: He was a very nice man, really. Ve ry kind. In -- 
in the Soviet Union wa sn
™t that easy to talk, 
cause you never know who -- who -- who gonna re
port you or some thing. But I was open with 
him, and he was naïve in some  
cases. Wa s a colonel but he wa s na
ïve. When he retired, he -- he 
came to me , he said Andrei, I w
ould like to see you go and help 
collect -- bring in -- buy some  
potatoes for wintertime for the organizations. I sai
d, I -- I -- I go, but can 
you give me  the order 
this -- and name  of my - -  my boss?  He said 
yes. And what makes you -- 
this different?  Said, you 
are paying here. I -- I said, depending how much
 you have save [indecipherable] for -- for 
business [indecipherable]. If you give -- give  it his order, then I will ha ve a day 10 dollars, if you 

give it to mi ne [indecipherable] you have five 
dollars. He said you are so smart, I even didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416  
70 
 
 
think about it. I said, because you don™t need it. 
You would need it, you would think about it. He 
swallowed that too, but he w-was a very nice 
guy, really he was a ve
ry wonderful guy. He was 
smiling [indecipherable] he had very -- he says, 
I went thinking on about that, he said, because 
you don™t need it. This was -- will teach people. 

Q: That was what I was goi
ng to ask you, is this --  
A: He -- he -- he -- 

Q: -- is -- that -- what you went 
through, is that what it -- it -- it 
-- is that how it changed you in 
some way?  

A: Affect me. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: If not changed me , affect -- 

Q: Affected you. 

A: -- affect. Sure. Sure did. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Because people who have it ve ry easy don™t a
ppreciate it. And hard -- hard working people 
turn out better than people who lives -- the mone
y the -- the parents earn 
it, or the grandparents. 
This -- this doesn™t ma ke you a better person, only worse. 

Q: You know -- 

A: Mostly. 

Q: -- as you were talking before when you -- when 
you had to lift the concrete
 blocks in the coal 
mi ne. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416  
71 
 
 
Q: I was thinking that in some  way ma ybe -- 
ma ybe when you were helping your father move 
things when you were younger -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- that could have helped -- helped you to survive as well. 

A: Definitely, definitely. 

Q: You know. 

A: I wa -- I was so strong when I was 13 year 
old, I could take a bag of -- of 150 pounds and -- 
and go up with in the steps. I got always very 
strong legs. The legs ma ke the difference. When 

you see boxing or some thing, a boxer, when his leg is gone, he is gone. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I played a lots of soccer and -- and 
-- and running around a lot with children, and this 
what made me strong. I want like -- now children 
are living differently. I 
-- I -- I could go away 
for all day long, my mot her know I will be at home
 at -- at -- in time, she never looked for me , 
she was glad she got an extra pl ace in -- i-i-in
 -- in the room. One request  was I can™ t -- I 
couldn™t come  home later than when the light 
i -- i -- [indecipherable] I know, evenings no -- no 
streets for children. 

Q: To go back to your parents, who you™ve talk
ed about. Wh at do you -- you™ve me ntioned it in -
- in certain pl aces in the tape, but what do you th
ink they gave you, that helped you to survive?  

What were the -- what we re those elements, lessons? 

A: I -- I -- I -- first of all, 
everythi ng. Because you inheriting 
br ain, you™re inheriting legs, you 
inheriting muscles, you know, i-
i-i-i-i-if not inheriting, 
they give it to you.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416  
72 
 
 
A: You know, this what it helps. 
I -- my father was always my role model, because what -- what 
he -- he could do, you know, ma de me proud o-of him 
that he -- he cou -- he - he was that strong. 
He -- he passed away he was 40 year old, so li
ke -- just like Mother
. She was born in 1901, and 
he -- he died in 1941, exactly. My mother 
l-lived from -- a wa -- 41 year and he 40. 
Q: Young, very young. 
A: Very young. 

Q: Very young. Is there anything An
drei, that I have not asked, th
at you have -- that you wrote 
down, that you would have 
liked to talk about -- 

A: You helped me  a lot. 

Q: We ll, I really appreciate your 
sharing your story. It™s a real -- 
A: You know, one thing you will always forget in 
an interview like this, and if you forget only 
one thing, you™re very, very good. I™m telling you. Ya -- 
don™t -- I -- I -- I thinki ng this in -- two 

y -- two year later I wouldn™t be able to do that. 
Q: Why?  
A: Because the brain ge tting older, aging. 

Q: It™s funny though, you said before you -- it wa
s some thing that happened five years ago -- 
A:  That ™s -- 

Q: -- you --you don™t reme mber, but 50 years ago you reme mber. 

A: That™s the way it is. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Most of the people. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Ifs, God forbid you forget these things 
too, then you have to worry about Alzheime r. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0416

A: She came  visit us, and my mother was compla
ining, you know, Andrei don™t drink milk at all. 
And she said, ah, that™s not so, cause  I bet I will

 and she counted to five
, the glass was empty. 
Q: She was smart. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: She was very smart. 

A: Yeah, she -- sh-she [indecipherable] it. This
