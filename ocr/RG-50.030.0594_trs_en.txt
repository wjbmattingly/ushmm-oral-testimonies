A: Yes, I have a sister .  
Q: And her name is? 

A: 
Erika
(ph). 
Q: All right, well, can you de
scribe your childhood fo r me? 
A: We had a very happy childhood. My fa
ther was a very productive merchant. We 
had a wonderful family life. My family wa
s very active in our congregation, and our 
congregation in 
Berlin
 encompassed and really was 
the Œ the last of the giant 
synagogues that were built in 
Berlin
. When  I say giant synagogues, I™m talking 
about a synagogue that housed
 in excess of a th
ousand people. But it was the very 
last one that ga Œ its inauguration came a
bout in 1930, the year that I was born, and 
it died, or was extingu
ished in 1938, on 
Kristallnacht
. 
Q: Do you recall the na
me of this synagogue? 
A: Well, the Œ yes I do. The synagogues in 
Berlin
 were not named for a 
congregation whatever the name was. Th
e large synagogues were named for the 
streets that they were on. And the stre
et that Œ that my  synagogue was on was 
Prince Œ Prince Regenten Strasse
, 
Prince Regent Street
. I was about 10 minute Œ 
less than a 10 minute walk from 
Œ from my  home to the synagogue. 
Q: What denomination wa
s it? Was it Orthodox?

A: It was a lit Œ what we call in 
Germany
 was called Liberal. It had a choir, it had 
an organ, it had those things that 
Orthodoxy would not have smiled on. 
Q: You mentioned that your father was a 
me rchant. Wh at was his line of business 
exactly? 
A: My father had a Œ along with his 
brothers owned a wholesale Œ wholesale 

merchant of women™s hosiery. I think that wa
s really the main part of their business, 
and some other accessories in addition ther
eto. But mainly Œ mainly their business 
consisted of wholesale hosiery. Rememb er
 everything at Œ during those Œ those 
years was constituted by Mo
m and Pop businesses, and 
my father was a very 
successful merchant. And also, very sharing,
 very sharing a-as far as his willingness 
to share his good fortune 
with the community. My fath
er also was a front line 
soldier in World War I. And he was active Œ 
he was Œ he was in the Œ he was very 
active in the congregation. 

Q: So, I™m Œ I™m guessing that that means th
at your family didn™t only  go to high 
holid ay services, they would Œ they  woul
d have practiced every week, or how Œ 
how did that work at the time? 

A: I Œ I would Œ I would generally go t Œ wi
th my father almost every Friday night 
to services. Maybe some once in a while 
on Saturday , but Friday  night was a Œ a 

norm for us.

Q: What Œ what did your mo th
er do during the day? Did she have a job, or did she 
stay at home? 
A: My father Œ my  Œ my  mo ther was a home Œ a home-keeper, if that™s the proper 
terminology. We had a Œ we 
had a beautiful apartment and my  mo th er kept things 
flowing. 

Q: You mentioned that your father wa
s a successful businessman. Would you 
describe your family as middle class, upper-middle class Œ 
A: Upper-middle class. 
Q: Can you describe the apartment 
or house that you used to own? 

A: Well, if I took you there I could tell yo
u Œ show you exactly wh
ere it is, as I have 
taken members of my family. Unfortunat
ely it™s not standing any mo re. I can 

visualize the apartment inmy head exactly. My Œ my 
ro om was towards the end Œ 
the rear of the Œ of the ap
artment build ing. I had a balc
ony, and Œ wh ere I raised 
vegetables, tomatoes, occasionally flowers.  We had a lovely residence, beautiful 
residence. 
Q: Was this in the garden, the vegetables and flowers? 

A: No, this Œ this was in a Œ on a Œ 
on the window box in Œ on the balcony. 
Q: Do you recall how many ro
oms were in this house? 
A: Substantial number of rooms, th
at™s all I can tell you, I™ve no id ea.

Q: Did your fami ly have
 any housekeepers or Œ 
A: Yeah, we had a Œ we had a Œ we had a housekeeper. 
Q: Okay , any nannies, or Œ 
A: Yes, I had a nanny. And a matter of fact
, at home, I think we have a picture of 
myself dressed up as little boys were dur
ing that time period, with my nanny. 
Q: Do you recall whether your 
nanny was Jewish or Gentile? 
A: Definitely not Jewish. 
Q: Do you remember 
going to  school in 
Germ any
? 
A: Yes, when my  Œ my  parents en rolled me in public school in 
Berlin
, it was 
decided th at™s where I would go, and I lasted
 in that school for about maybe a day, 

maybe two days, three days, I don™t know. Ve
ry, very quickly, I 
was beaten during 
that time period and Œ because the other boy
s asked me what I was, who I was, and 
th-the minute I said Jew, I was put to 
the test immediately. And my  mo ther was 
called to school, she was told by th e principa
l of the school that it would be best for 

my  Œ my  protection to be ta
ken out of that school. So  I 
Œ my  experience of public 
school may have been  extinguished then afte
r one day, or Œ or two days at the mo st. 
Q: Do you recall what year this
 was, was this first grade Œ 
A: Well, would have been 
Œ it would have been 19 Œ 
ro ughly about 1936, I would 
imagine.

Q: Because you just mentioned that they
 had asked you who they were and you 
replied you were a Jew , I know this might 
be hard to an swer, but did you have a 
sense that this was something you could ta
lk about? Did your parents warn you not 
to say that you were a Jew, or conver
sely did they say that that™s fin e? 

A: I think my  parents tried to protect me  
by not saying mu ch of anything. And I was 

never told  what to say or what not to 
say. But I think I, from that experience, I 
learned rather quickly as to what I was, 
who I was. And I think my  parents shielded 
me from all the discriminatory acts that 
had been ongoing in the mid-1930s. For 

example, I had an  uncle of mine, a brothe
r of my  Œ of my Œ my  mo ther, who was a 
very successful attorney in 
Germany
 and 
Berlin
. And of course he was Œ you 
know, I found out later on why he wasn
™t work ing any mo re, because he was 

excluded from Œ from that po
ssibility. But generally I woul
d say my parents really 
shielded me up to that time period. That™s
 about the best way I can Œ I can put it. 
Q: So you said you were taken ou
t of school almo st imme diately. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And then what happened?  

A: I was enrolled in a school, in a Jewish
 school with obviously, Jewish students, 
but not a religious school, okay ? So, there 
were no Œ th ere Œ there was Œ there were 
no re Œ Jewish religious courses given. It
 was taking the regular curriculum within a

framework of Jewish teachers and Œ and ju
st a framework of Œ of Jews Œ Jewish 
children. 
Q: Do you recall some friends 
or friendships from that time? 
A: Yes, I do. We Œ we get a Œ a bulletin from the municipality of 
Berlin
, where I 
recognized a young lady Œ a young lady Œ a 
Œ a Œ a person™s name, and I wrote to 
her, and she sent me b ack, she recognized
 my name immediately, and I don™t know 
how, and sent me back a picture of our cl
ass, which was unbelieva
ble. So yes, I Œ I-
I think th at™s the Œ the only person that I 
Œ that I have recog Œ I have a me mo ry 
thereof. When we 
Œ when we left 
Berlin
, we had Œ wh en we Œ I should sa Œ correct 
this; when children we
re fortunate enough 
to leave school, to 
go out of the country 
in some fashion or other, we would all 
have little autograph 
books and we would 
sign off on a little note to that 
st Œ t-to that boy or girl. Maybe it was just putting our 
name and saying in German, 
best wishes for the future
, maybe a little poem, maybe 
a little picture. But I do have a book like th
at at home, with about Œ the names of 
about maybe 15 to 20 different student
s, and Œ and likewise a Œ a number of 
teachers who Œ whose classes I 
attended, wishing me well. 

Q: Since you went to a Jewish school, I suppose mo st of your friends came  from 
that circle. Do you recall 
having any Gentile friends? 
A: No, I don™t Œ do not, no.

Q: What are your first memo
ries of Nazis or Nazism? 
A: I th Œ I think probably that experience 
in school was probably  the Œ the Œ the first 
experience that I had at that point. My pare
nts were no longer able to subdue their Œ 
their thoughts as to trying to sh ield and 
protect me. And I do remember very clearly 
that either with my father 
or my mother, I went to a gr
ocery store nearby, and the Œ 
the merchant, the owner of that establishm
ent, who knew my  parents, looked at me 
with my  blond hair at that time, and sa
id, he doesn ™t look like a Jew. And that 
scared the hell out of me, because I knew 
what that meant. And then in 1938, 
obviously th e Œ my  father and Œ and I, ev
ery Sunday would go to  a park that was 
like two or three minutes away from our ho
me, and we would sit on the bench and 
my father would schmooze, if that™s th
e correct word, with neig hbors who would 
come by. And my  father delighted  in showin
g me off as Œ as his son, and Œ and then 
one day we could no longer 
sit on the park bench, we 
had to sit on a Œ on a yellow 
bench, wh ich said, 
nur für
 
Juden
, for Jews only. And several times when we did 
that, we sat down, 
we were stoned. 
Q: That me ans people threw stones at you. 
A: Threw stones, yeah. 
Q: How did your father react, what did he do?

A: My father always said to me, I always Œ 
I told my father the 
last time that I went 
to synagogue with him 
that I was afraid for my life. A
nd my father said to me that 
he had fought for 
Germ any
 in  Wo rld War I, and nothing would happen to me, that 
Germany
 had had waves of anti-Semitism previo
usly, they come 
and they go, and 
because of our Œ of our natu
re, of what my father has 
achieved, what he had done, 
he would protect me, and no
thing would happen to us. Wh
ether he actually believed 
that, I don™t know. It di-didn™t Œ after thos
e words, wh ile they were en couragin g, I 
have to tell you that I honestly
 did not feel very  mu ch better. 
Q: Do  yo u  reme mb er a mo men t wh ere you  st
arted feeling unease, or fear, or did it 
just build gradually? 
A: It built gradually, and I Œ I think it gr
adually Œ and the Œ the Œ the heightened 
mo ment of fear was about a week  or two weeks prior to 
Kristallnacht
, when as I 
said, we went to Œ we, my father and I, 
went to services generally every Friday 
evening. And on this par
ticular Friday even ing, uniformed memb ers of brown 
shirts, black shirts, call it whatever you wa
nt, uniformed Nazis, came into the front 
door of our synagogue, and th
reatened Œ threaten
ed the congregation,
 threatened our 
rabbi, and our rabbi was magnificent in de
fending us verbally, and ultimately the 
Nazis retreated. And at that moment, as 
I said, when we walk
ed home I told my

father I was afraid for my  life. Then 
two weeks later, you know, we experienced 
Kristallnacht
. 
Q: I™m going to ask you about that in just 
a moment, but I™d like to get back to your 
nanny. You mentioned that she was not Jewi
sh. Do  you recall how long she stayed 
in your household, an d when
 she would have to leave? 
A: I Œ I think Œ by th e time I was six years 
old, I did not have one any mo re. So my  

Œ my  recollection of her are mo re Œ mo re 
photographic than Œ than  anything that 
might have transpired between
 us. I will say this, that on
 Kristallnacht
, my parents, 
by so me fluke of miracles, were not with 
me. They  were on vacation, and I learned 
later on that my  father really, physically 
was not doing well. But they were not with 
us, and I was with my  grandmother. My 
grandmother had a non-Jewish wo rker Œ 
servant in the house and I think Œ I certai
nly can recall that Œ that she told my 

grandmother that she needed  to get out of
 the house because something Œ so mething 
was going to  happen that evening. 
Q: So what did your grandmother do? 
A: Really nothing, except to Œ she 
was a very, very tight Œ tightfisted. 
[knocking] 
Q: One moment. 
[break]
 You had said that you were with your grandmother on 
Kristallnacht Œ 
A: Right.

Q: Œ and that one of the people who work ed
 for her had warned 
her that she should 
leave the house, is that correct? 
A: No, that Œ that she was going to leave the house. 
Q: She was going to  
leave the house. 
A: She was not Œ sh e was not going to  stay 
all day, that Œ that she had some ideas 
that something of an Œ she wouldn™t say wh
at, and maybe she didn™t even know, but 
she felt that she should not 
stay there all day, and left
. And my  grandmother was a 
very primped, starched lady, never 
smiled. You know, it™s one of those 
grandmothers that Œ you know. And I experienced 
Kristallnacht 
in her hou Œ in Œ 
in her home. And unfortunat
ely, her apartment that sh
e lived in overlooked the 
synagogue, over Œ was Œ e-even though ou
r synagogue was a bloc
k or two Œ I think 
one block away, I think we were on th e fl
oor where we could 
look and see the top 
of our synagogue. And I could see the Œ you know, I could see the fires bursting 

through the Œ through th e roof. 
Q: So, can you describe basi
cally that day, and/or that
 night to me? What happened 
in the building that you were, an
d what were you seeing outside? 
A: Well that Œ that night I Œ I was in my  Œ my  grandmother™s apartment, I had a 

room that was mine, that was facing out in
 the street, th at overlooked a block away 
that Œ wh at did overlook our synagogue. 
And during th e night, two uncles of mine 

 
Interv iew with J o hnLang 
 
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
14
came. One on my  mo th er™s side, who hid in 
a linen closet, one on
 my father™s side, 
who hid underneath the bed that I was suppos
ed to be sleeping in. And the only th Œ 
only thought wi Œ these are terrible thoughts
 to have Œ the only th ought that I had, 
that if my  uncle is found underneath my  be
d, should th e Nazis come and invade the 
house, I would be taken also. So I really
 hadn™t Œ had little Œ little hope that I would 
live through the night. I heard all the scr
eams of the Œ of Œ of wh at was Œ wh at 
might be or what was going on in the st
reets below us. And Œ and every knock  on 
the door, my  heart Œ was everybody™s hear t in that apartment stopped Œ stopped 
running, because we all Œ always thought 
that maybe the Nazis would come to Œ to 
the door, break in the hou Œ 
break into the apartment, se
arch the apartment and only 
Œ God only knows what would happen at Œ at
 that particular point. It was the most 
horrific night of my  life. I have never, neve
r, never experienced a 
night of fear, that 
I did on that night, never. And I remember it
 to this day, and I will remember it for 

the rest of my life. 
Q: What happened in  the mo rning, and did 
anyone end up breaking in that night? 
A: No, we™re Œ as luck would have it, th
ere were no, other than neighbors just 
checking on us and so forth,
 and my  two uncles, I said
, who came to the door and 
sought sanctuary Œ sh elter. The apartment 
was not broken into. The next mo rning, I 
left the apartment. I don™t know how in  the hell my  Œ my grandmother would ha Œ

would have let me go, but sh
e did. And I walked my self
 back to our home, which 
was maybe five minutes away, to see whet
her our home had been broken into  Œ our 
apartment had been broken into . And wh
at I Œ what I saw – indescribable. 
Q: You were unaccomp anied? You were alone? 
A: I Œ unaccompanied. 

Q: Did you go into
 the apartment? 
A: No, I did not go into th
e apartment. I saw  the door 
was closed, I saw there was 
no damage to the outside of 
the Œ of the apartment. But 
when I came out, we were 
just maybe a hundred yards away from a 
Œ from a square, and I Œ I™ve told my  
children this, there was a huge stain on th
e Œ on the pavement, on the Œ and one of 
the Nazis asked another one, what is that? A
nd he said, that is the blood of a Jew. 
Every store in our Œ in our
 neighborhood th at was Jewi
sh owned had been  broken 
into, had been vandalized, had been  vandaliz
ed, not only broken in to and Œ and Œ 
and Œ but it was painted Jew, star of 
David
, and it was Œ it was the mo st Œ and Œ and 
people were cheering. That was the beginning of death. 

Q: Were you still alone at this time on the streets? 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Where did you end up going? 
A: I think ultimately I went back 
to my grandmother™s apartment.

Q: Did you find memb ers of your family there? 
A: No. My Œ my Œ in the m
eantime, I think my  Œ my  Œ my  mo ther and father had 
called, because they had heard Œ I don™t 
know where they were, 
but they were on 
vacation. They had heard what had gone on
, and I think my  grandmother told  them 
to stay away and not come 
back from where they Œ and 
they did not come back for 
several days later on. 

Q: How were you reu
-reunited with an adult at that point? 
A: Well, I stayed with my grandmother 
until my Œ until my pare
nts returned from 
wherever they were. 

Q: What happened when 
your parents returned? 
A: For me it was just a continuation of f
ear. And I think Œ I think at that time, I 
think we Œ I think my  parents showed fear
 for the first time as well. Openly. I™m 

sure they were Œ they were 
Œ they were in fear previous
ly. My father, as I found out 
later on, had to take on a non-Jewish part
ner into the business,
 in order for the 
busin ess to continue. And th at happened  mayb
e a year or two year
s even before that 
time. I didn™t know the reasons for it, w
hy someone else had to be taken in th e 
business. But these were things that were 
kept from me, to shie
ld me as much as 
possible from a family, a Jewish family
, that was descending into hell. 
Q: How soon after Œ 

 
Interv iew with J o hnLang 
 
 
October 15, 2010 
 

 
 
17
A: I do know Œ do know one 
thing. That during this 
time period, my father was 
always was Œ was cognizant of the need to 
help those that were less fortunate, that 
could not help themselves. And I remember
 o n  several occasions, my father would 
ask my  mo ther to load up a ba
g of groceries, as me to u 
Œ to take some of my  best 
toys, and he had a list of Œ of
 names of people that we 
would driv e to, and we would 
walk up in the apar Œ to
 the apartment dwellings, and be greeted by name, 
sometimes just with smiles, and my father
 would always hand them an envelope, 
and I knew that that was mo r Œ was mone
y, and you know, these people were so 
thankful. And I™m sure none of them survived. 

Q: At this point, were you still living 
in your apartment or
 house Œ at home? 
A: Yes, yeah. Immediately after my Œ my 
parents returned, which was within days 
after 
Kristallnacht
, I returned and we lived in our apartment until Œ until I left 
Germany
.  
Q: When did you first hear that you were
 leaving? How was the news broken to  
you? 

A: Well, let me take you back  in time a little bit. 
Kristallnacht 
was November 9
th
, 
1938, and I don™t know the reasons for it, but in Œ sometime in December of 1938, 
on a winter day, I was walking with my
 sister, not far from Œ from where our 
apartment was, and something within me, I la
shed out Œ physically I lashed out at a

Œ at a member of the 
Hitler
 youth who was collecting money fo r whatever, 
whatever the purpose was, I have 
no idea, okay, for whatever the 
Hitler 
youth was 
collecting money fo r. And wh en I say lash
ed out, I™m talking about physically 
assaulted. And inflicted damage to the unif
orm, inflicted damage to that person. My 
sister dragged me home, told my  Œ my  Œ 
my  parents. I guess th
ey found out very 
quick ly who it was, that individual that 
I had accosted. I cannot
 give you th e reason 
for it, I don™t know. And at that juncture
, the Œ my p Œ my parents, my mother, 
contacted th e parents of this individual. I 
can™t even tell you whether it was male or 
female that I accosted, but 
I do know the individual 
was a good Œ good head taller 
than I was. That I can tell you. My mo ther
 promised to pay wh atever damages they 
Œ they wanted to have 
for this incident not 
to be reported to the 
Hitler
 youth leader, 
which could possibly lead to my  being 
taken away permanently. That did not 
happen, and a week or two later, I found 
myself with my mother. We went to 
what™s considered a cour
t in this Œ in this

 youth leader™s home, where I was

A: Yes. Tha-That Œ I heard my mother 
screaming, crying, pleading, begging and 
myself sitting silently in an
 Œ an outside room, because I was not immediately in the 

room. I cannot tell you the Œ the wo rds th
at were exchanged, but certainly the 
description I™ve given 
you is accurate, I know that it 
is. And then after a while, I 
was called into the room, and my mother said  Œ I was told in advance that if I h ad 

the chance to apologize,
 to do so, and I apologized in 
the mo st profuse manner that I 
could, and my  life was spared. My 
mo ther gave me my  second life. 
Q: What happened next? Did y
our parents get a sense that they needed to leave? 
A: I think I Œ and again, here™s where th
e guesswork comes in. An eight year old is 
not told  too mu ch, an eight year old, and maybe today they are, but in those times 

an eight year is told what 
to do and when to do it andhow to do it. And at that 
point, I am sure my mother and father mu
st have thought how they were going to 
get me out of Œ out of
 Berlin
, and do it fast, before anyt
hing changes, before Œ 
before somebody in the 
Hitler
 youth group that had decide
d Œ by the way, my Œ my  
parents, my  mo ther dis Œ paid a Œ a very
 substantial fine, I was told Œ before

Œ my  guesstimate is that I got onto th e 
Kindertransport 
list possibly a little faster, and ma
ybe I got onto the list at all 
because of Œ of this terrible incident. And I left Œ I left

towards the end of January. So  roughly about 
a Œ within four weeks after this Œ  after 
this incident, I was out of Œ out of 
Berlin
. 
Q: What were you to ld, wh ere were
 you going to  be 
going and why? 
A: Well, we had Œ we had 
had papers to come to 
America
 for some time, except 
that they were taken out rather late. My Œ 
my parents, or my  mo ther had a third or 
fourth cousin living in 
America
, somebody who I™d never met, some body whose 
name I™d never heard of before. But anyw
ay, they had given us the affidavit to 
come to 
America
. What was lacking to come to 
America
 was the quota number, 
because my parents, my moth
er, my father, I guess, always believed to the end that 
things would not get to that 
point in time. So we Œ we ha
d the affidavit, but no quota 
number to come to 
America
. Had we stayed and had I stayed in Œ in 
England Œ
 or 
had I stayed in, excuse
 me, had I stayed in 
Germa ny
 for my  quota number to 
appear from the American consulate there, 
I would have been de
ad. So I went to 
England
, and my  Œ my  Œ my  family did have Œ 
did have Œ we did have family in Œ 
in 
England
, but I was bounced around all 
over the place in Œ in Œ in 
England
, 
including I lived with a wonderful Christia
n family in a small town about two and a 
half hours north  of 
Londo n
 for about half a year or so
, and went to church with 
them. They shared what they 
shared with Œ what
ever they had they  shared with me. 
They  were wonderful, caring, giving people
, and only a year ago,
 did I lose contact

with Œ with that family . We would exch
ange Christmas cards or Thanksgiving 
cards, and it was only last year that I fina
lly failed to get a card, and that Œ as a 
matter of fact, only recently, I wrote to 
the ca Œ the munici
pality, asking whether 
they had any records as to what might ha
ve happened to  this, 
you know, person of 
that Œ of that family. So I™m Œ I™m ve
ry, very  grateful. And you should know 
Kindertransport
, I mean, people tell you, 
Kindertransport 
came about because of 
a group of Quak ers persuading Parliament
 to take action, and Œ wh ich Œ that 
allowed 10,000 un-unaccompa
nied children to enter 
England
. So Ch ristians have 
been very, very good
 to me, and I have a great love and admiration for Œ for 
Christians. And to this day, where I participate in a lot of Christian activities. 
Q: We do want to h
ear about your time in 
England
 and exactly how that unfolded, 
but let™s go back a bit to the 
Kindertransport 
itself. Do you recall the date? 
A: End of January , or Œ and 
it Œ wh en I say end, ro ughly of Œ I™ve tried to look that 
up several times. To the best of my abilitiesto come up with records, it looks like 

the third week in January. That™s why 
I said roughly about a month after this 
terrible incident, which was an act of sheer 
stupidity on my  part. It wasn™t bravery, 
it was stupidity that could have cost me  
my  life. I Œ I should have wo und up in 
Theresienstadt
 or in  one of the Œ probably  in 
that camp , and Œ and that only the 
love of my  mo ther pleading kept me from that.

Q: Do you recall the train itself? 
A: Yes, I remember standingon the platform in Œ in 
Berlin
, on the 
Ha uptbahnhof
, 
and that Œ and th e Œ the Œ the Nazi offici
al calling out the list of name s. And I 
reme mb er t h at my  n ame was n o t  immed i
ately  called on the first go-round. All the 

other names were there, and I started to cry,
 because I knew down 
deep in my  heart, 
that if I didn™t get out, it would cost me 
my life. Now that™s a 
hell of a thought for 
an eight year old to have, but those were
 my  thoughts. And Œ and I cried, and my  
mother and father who I re Œ I already se
parated from, they were standing on one 

side, and I was on th e other side, we had 
already had our goodbyes. And my  mo ther 
said, he doesn™t want to leave us. And I di
dn™t have the courage to tell her that the 
reason I was crying because my name wasn
™t Œ was not on the list, and my life 
wasn™t going to be saved. And then  the s
econd go-round, my Œ my name was ca lled. 

Yeah, it was Œ it was a horren
dous Œ horrendous day at a train station, parents and 
children were Œ were kissing, hugging. Mo st
 children would never see their parents; 
I was fortunate to some degree, but nevert
heless, whatever the circumstance was, 
for the child and parent, it was traumatic. Ab
solutely traumatic. What Œ what parent 
today would part with their seven, eight year
 old, nine year old, 10 year old, no,

that it might be the final goodbye hug or 
kiss that they would Œ wo

 tell you, I Œ we were allowed Œ 
Kindertransport 
told us that Œ that each child 
could bring along one specified size 
suitcase. I should tell you ab
out two weeks before that tim
e, my father took me to 
the leading store in Œ in
 Berlin
, and bought every suit that 
he could Œ that I had an 
eye on, and he was going to  deck  me out in as many suits and coats and jackets as 

he could find, and Œ 
and ultimately it was all reduced 
down to nothing, because all 
those things had to be left behind. 
Q: Did th ey have to be le
ft behind before you packed
, or was it somehow on the 
train Œ 
A: Yes, yes, this all had to Œ the train 
Œ the only thing we could take on th e train 
was one small suitcase, that 
was it. Whatever fit in that
 suitcase was fine, but seven 
or eight suits were not going to  fit into th
at suitcase. So Œ but my father always 
wanted to do the best for 
Œ for Œ for me, all the time. 
Q: Once you™re on the train, what was 
happening? How many kids were around 
you? 

A: I Œ I would s Œ I would say Œ well, the tr
ain Œ we Œ we sat in a Œ each Œ ea Œ the 
train was sectioned off with little compar

six or eight chil Œ six or eight people, in

all I can tell you is that I think we all sa

say a word, either to

each other, or to anyone. We were told to  be as quiet as possible, not to say 
anything, not to say anything at all. And it wasn™t until we crossed the border into
 

Holland
 that some words were said
 to Œ between each other. 
Q: So you were aware of the border crossing? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Do you Œ 

A: And we were aware at that point before 
Œ before Œ obviously befo re the train left 
Berlin
, and the train, in going across the borde
r at that Œ at both junctures, Nazis 
came on, and Œ to inspect our Œ our docu
mentation. Which was also a terrible 
moment because God forbid 
they™d saw something that we were unaware of, that 
might cause you to be pulled off the train. 
Which did not happen, to the best of my  

knowledge, but that tho
ught was always with us. 

Q: What happened once the tr
ain was in Dutch territory?

crossing a Œ a rather Œ I would say Œ not a 
dangerous body of water, but certainly 
a body of water that was not smooth. 
Q: Do you reme mb er arriving in 
Britain
? 
A: Yeah. From there Œ from Œ again, I don™t 
know the Œ the name of the port that we 
arrived at, but from there we took a train to
 London
, and where we were welcomed 
by lots of individuals, or
ganizations, people. You know,
 little bit of normalcy crept 
into Œ there wasn™t any nor
malcy in our lives, none.  
Q: Di-Did you know 
anyone on the train?  
A: No, nobody. I should say Œ 
or, I ta-take that back, my 
sister  was on the train. But 
I don™t rememb er whether she sat with 
me in my  comp artment. I don™t know. 
Q: We haven™t spoken about your sister

A: Yeah, she™s seven years older. So as far

 do. And a Œ an English lady stopped, with

her Œ with  her little Œ little daughter, maybe 
two or three years even younger than Œ 
than me, and asked me Œ cause I couldn™t 
speak English very well at that point, 
cause nobody gave a damn  whether I learne
d the English language or not Œ asked 
me what was wrong, and in  my  halting Engl
ish I explained to he

lost I was. And that was Œ she was the first 
p erson that Œ that offered a shoulder to Œ 
to cry on, and Œ and gave me some hope
ful encouragement. An
d wh en she Œ when  
she left, sh e put a couple of coins in my 
hand, wh ich I thought was so gracious, and 
so nice. It was the first person that really s
howed that they Œ they really did care. So 
most of that time, I was w
ith my Œ lived in 
my  uncle™s home. I was moved around 
from school to school, I can™t tell you why. 
No body really gave me any Œ any real 
instruction on th e English la
nguage. We were told to 
be quiet, not to Œ not to 
complain, not to speak
 German loudly or an ything lik
e that. And weeks before the 
war, and maybe Œ maybe a mont
h or so befo re the war broke out, my  parents were

Berlin
, came t Œ came to e Œ to

English kids to be evacuated. 

Q: At that point were you pl
aced with a family, or was 
it an institutional situation Œ 
A: I was Œ and Œ wh en I was Œ  

Q: Evacuated. 

A: Œ I was placed Œ all I know Œ remembe

door of a home and say, we have a boy, or

 he wasn™t getting his licks in on me, and 

he called me a dirty Jew. And he probably
 regretted that, because his face was a 
bloody mess within Œ 
within less than a minute. I pi

said,

end, and I threw him down on the

Q: Was she there in 
London 
at that point? 
A: Yes. I can™t tell you, I don™t know. Ma

Q: Do you recall the bombings?

Germany
 to ok  Œ  actu a lly  my  mo th er an d  my fa Œ  my  Œ  my  Œ  my  mo th er and  my

Germa ny

months or so  in ninet Œ of maybe Œin 
Œ in the beginning of 1938. They would

might until I came to

mimi c th eir  wo rd s, mi mic th ey  Œ  th e way  th
at they pronounced word s. When  I came 
out of the Œ th-the mo vie theater, I would tr
y  to  rememb e r  th e wo
rds that I™d heard, 
that some which I did not know, and Œ 
many which I did not know. And wh en Œ 
when  I went to school th e following Mo nd
ay, I would try to memo rize those word s 
from the movies, and Œ and then  I would look them up in  the dictionary. So  I 
learned Œ I-I would say my Œ my prime teachers for the Englis
h language were the 
stars of the Œ of the 1940s
, and the best of them. 
Q: So you said you were in 
London
 during the blitz Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ is that correct? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And that™s when yo
ur father passes away? 
A: No, he didn™t pass away. He™s Œ my  fath
er lingered for a long time, a long time. I 
would say from some time in Œ sometime in
 1940 to 1941. So I™d
 say my father was 
par-paralyzed, incapacitated Œ totally incap
acitated during this whole time period, 
and did not pass away until I wo
uld say maybe three, four 
months, five months after 
I came to 
America
. And then one day my  au nt told me that she had to sit down and 
tell me something rather seriously, and I kn
ew already what it was, and it wasn™t a 

great big shock, even  I was, at that tim
e I was Œ I was 10 year
s old. You know, it

was Œ it was sad news for me, but what was sad really was Œ the saddest mo me nt for 
me in  
England
 really was separation from my fath
er, because at that point when  Œ 
when  I was suppos
ed to come to 
America
, I was taken to the hospital. And my  
father could understand, but he couldn™t ta
lk. My father was told
 that I was going to  
America
 the following day, and this would be the last time that he would Œ th at I 
would be in his presence, or that I woul
d be able to see him. And – my  father 
placed his hand on my Œ on my head. I di
dn™t know what that meant, and Œ and I 
didn™t have Œ eight, nine year olds, 10 year
 olds, don™t ask anything, we just listen. 
And then , when  I was 13, I was Bar Mitzvahed in 
New York
, and a rabbi put his 
hand on my head, and I knew what my fa
ther was doing. That probab ly was the 
saddest day that I had in 
England
. And  my  mo th er came to  
America
. My mother 
stayed in Œ in 
England
 with my father obviously, to
 the end, which was maybe a 
half a year or so after I came to 
America
. At that time, even as I came to 
America
 
on a ship Œ and I have the 
Œ the boarding pass still at 
home, and I even have a 
picture of the ship which one of my  assist
ants dredged up fo r me from the internet. 
That was a ship that took me from 
Liverpool 
to 
Montreal
. Took about 10 days, 10 
- 12 days. We were in a convoy for about 
the first two or three days. We were a 
relatively modest sized ship, passenger cargo 
ship. Had a Œ as I said , a convoy for 
the first tw o or three days™ time, which y
ou Œ wh ere you felt relatively safe, because

the destroyers were throwing depth char
ges around, and you never knew wh ether 
they were firing at somebody Œ something in 
reality, or just as a Œ a precaution. And 
then maybe on the th e third or fourth 
day, th e convoy was gone, and you were 
alone. And there you were in the north 
Atla ntic
, and as I found out later on, maybe 
only 30 or 40 percent of the 
ships that sailed on the north 
Atlantic
 during th at time 
period actually got through. I was de Œ cert
ainly much aware of the fact that th e 
chances of getting th rough we
re Œ were at best 50 Œ 
50, and a life jacket was 
something th at was on me continuously , but he
ll, if that ship wa
s torpedoed, I knew 
that we were gone, all of us were gone. 
Q: So I™m very interested 
in exactly what you knew at 
the time as a child, and going 
back to when 
you™re still in 
Lo ndo n
, how was the decision ma
de that you were able 
to get to 
America
? Ho w mu ch  did you know in advance that you were able to Œ to 
do this and where were you sp
atially, were you still living at your uncles? Were the 

bombs co ming down , did you need to go u
nderground? Can you 
describe that for 
me? 

A: I™m going to take it back to 
Kristallnacht
. I was eight years, eight and a half 
years old on Novemb er eighth. On  Novemb er ninth I was 18 years old. I had 
peripheral vision at that point. I could s
ee what was going on. I had fear built into 
me. There wasn™t anything that I was not prep
ared to do or see. So I did not Œ I was

not any more Œ and I don™t want to use th
e word normal, I was not normal any more 
at that time. And there was Œ you know, I 
Œ I could Œ I did things Œ I™d experienced 
life as no other eight year old ever had, an
d as a result was able to cope with life on 
my  own in a way that no eight, nine or 
10 year old ever would. During the time 
period of the 
Lo ndo n
 blitz, I was with Œ I lived w
ith my Œ with 
my mother and 
father, and it was my Œ there was Œ the b
litz started every Œ every evening, every 
night time from Œ from as soon as it got dark
, til early in the morning, four or five 
hours of intense bombing. It was unbelievabl
e. As I said the Œ 
you know, you could 
hear the Œ the roar of the planes, it was 
Œ it was frightening, it was dreadful. In the 
mo rning you could see the glow, you coul
d s Œ buildings woul
d sh ake around us. 
You could see buildings that
 had been b-bombed out, 
you could see fires on the 
street. All the Œ all the wreckage Œ the 
only thing that was not wrecked was the 
spirit of the 
London
 people, who always remained 
calm,  and had their brooms in 
hand to tidy up the best way they coul
d. They were Œ they were miraculous. 
Abso lutely miraculous. Once 
in a while we did s-sleep in
 the Œ in the undergro und, 
which was deep underg round. Undergro und
 being subway, but which protected us 
from Œ from bombs up above. And once in 
a while Œ actually I rememb er one day 

when  I went to school, that the air raids st
arted in Œ in  the day time, and that was 
unusual because most of the 
bombing runs, the air raids st
arted in the Œ in the early

evening. And at that point I was in a bo
mb shelter from early 
in the morning to 
middle of the afternoon. I rush
ed home, and within an  hour
 later, I was back in the 
bomb sh elter. So I spent maybe 20 hours th
at day in various bomb sh elters. So I 
don™t get too excited any mo re about peop
le saying th at you kn
ow, you don™t know 
Œ you don™t know what it like Œ what it™s 
like being bomb ed, I certainly do know 
what it™s like. And I do know 
what it means to have fo ur or five, six, seven, 800 
planes overhead in 
London
, bombing the Œ th e 
[indecipherable]
 city to daylights. 
Was unbel Œ unbelievable. And then one Œ on
e day I was told by my mother that Œ 
that my  papers had Œ that our papers had come due to come to 
America
, and I 
gather they came due faster
 than Œ than people had 
thought. Because basically, 
people were being erad icated, or people were not able to leave 
Germany
 because of 
the war, they had Œ th ey Œ they  might ha
ve had papers also, 
or they were in 
concen tration camps now, and as a resu
lt our Œ our numb er Œ our quota numb er 
came up somewhat faster than Œ that had 
been  an-anticip ated, and say my  Œ our 
quota numb er came up in September, October of 1940, and that™s when  I exited 
from Œ from Œ from Œ from 
Lo ndo n
. And my  mo ther would have been free to go, 
had she decided to Œ to Œ to

A: I would say somewhere between 10 an
d 14 days. It was a Œ it was quite a 
voyage, quite a voyage. And as I said, the 
Œ the lifejacket, this cork lifejacket, 
bulky, was part of Œ pa
rt of my Œ my attire. Almost th
a Œ or certainly all day, and at 
night it was always right there for me to 
wear. But it was frightening as all hell to 
think that Œ that death would await us in 
the water, which it certainly was a Œ a great 
possibility of that happen
ing. Ships were being to
rpedoed left and right.  
Q: Were you many Œ were you one of 
many ch ildren, or were you the only 
unaccompanied child at that point? 

A: My sister was on that ship. How many 
passengers on the ship, I have no id ea. 
Q: So at this point your sister is 1 7 ? 
A: Yeah. My sister™s always seven years ol
der than I am, okay? If I am 10, she™s 17, 
if I Œ she™s always Œ she always is ah
ead of me, and as I said, there is no 
relationship per se, between a 10 year old an
d a 17 year old. It™s a Œ it™s a different 
element. 

Q: Did you know where you were going? 
A: To
 America Œ
 yes I did. I knew that we were goi
ng, that this cousin, this third or 
fourth  cousin who I had never heard of befo
re, who was kind enou

to 
America
 from 
Germany

America
. And that™s where I was 
bound for. So I landed in
 Mon t rea l
. I should tell 
you wh en  we Œ wh en I Œ the 10 hours or 
so, six hours prior to landing, somebody Œ 
somebody said, it smells differently. And 
it does smell differently on the water, 
when land is nearby. And ultimately so
mebody said, land. 
And you c
ouldn™t Œ 
couldn™t believe the cheers that went up fr
om all the people on deck. And of course 
me, being the internal pessimist said 
Jesus
, ships can get torpedoe
d just as easily fro 
Œ you know, five or six hours away from s
hore, than Œ than Œ than out on the Œ 
further out on the waters. And ships actua
lly were torpedoed 
closer, I found out 
later on. And we Œ we went to Œ to 
Mo n t real
, exited the ship in 
Montreal
, took a 
train from 
Montreal
 to 
New York
, and we Œ we was welcomed by my  uncle and 
aunt, as I said, third Œ th ird or f
ourth cousin s, who welcomed me to 
New York
 and 
tried to, you know, who accepted me, 
who Œ who cared Œ 
who had no other 
children, who cared for me. They had ve
ry limited means. My Œ my uncle was Œ 
these Œ these people had a Œ a small dry 
goods Œ they had a 
successful dry goods 
operation in 
Germany
, I™m not quite sure where, I think in 
Stettin
. And came to 
America
, realized what was happening, and 
my father Œ my Œ my uncle rather, 
became an elevator operator, local 
32B
. And ran an elevator in a Œ in a freight 
build ing. My  aunt did so mething that 
you probably  don™t 
even know, called 
piecework. Wa Œ were Œ meaning that she 
embroidered sweaters.
 And I would help

43
her to embroider these sweaters, and a result,
 at the end of the week I would get my  
dime allowance, and I would sp end that on
 the movies. And after I felt a little bit 
sure of my self, I would use some of that money for a comic book. And I graduated 
from Œ once I Œ once I mastered the art of 
comic books, I then graduated to real 
books, and that™s how I learned to read, wr
ite. I had some wonderful teachers in Œ in 
New York

decided I wo uld Œ should go back a

that for about oh, several months™ time.
 And then they  decided I was ready, 
language-wise, skill-wise, and they move

I™ve Œ we moved in to a Œ an area of

 called 
Washin gton Heights
, which 
many ca Œ many people called what the Œ the

were so many Germans Œ German Jewish peop
le living up in that area. And then I 
got moved around.

Q: What was 
America
 like for you? What does Œ wh at did it seem like? 
A: Well, 
America
 was very scary for me, it was Œ it was a-adjusting to a Œ a brand 
new environment. Give you another Œ a
nother aside. Obviously I-I gravitated to 
some children, Jewish children that were in
 my school to play with after Œ after 
hours. You know, we play on th e street a
nd play some games. And that happened 
for about a week or two Œ two, and those 
children, those boys 
asked me how Œ who 
I was and told me Œ asked me about some
thing about my background. And I told  
them very freely and o-openly where I came
 from, what I had experienced, the war, 
and so fo rth and so on. And one of them
 said, well why don™t 
you come up, my  Œ 
my  parents would like to meet you. So I we
nt upstairs to their apartment, and spoke 
to the parents, father, and again I rep
eated, you know, my Œ what we had gone 
through, and wh at life was like. And th e ne
xt day the boy came to me and said, my  
father doesn ™t wish Œ wish me to play wi
th  you anymore, because your stories are 
not believable, and they ™re t
oo dark. And from that point on I grav i Œ I stayed away 
from Jewish children altogether. And my be
st friend during this time period, that 
was 
New York
, before I moved elsewhere, was a Methodist family, who almo st 
adopted me. Took me wi Œ on Œ I lived 
with th em after school, and observed 
holidays, they bought gifts for 
me at Christmastime. They 
made me feel as part of 
the family. They were Meth
odists. And again, non-Jews
 had more compassion for

45
me than Jewish people. And th at Jewish people here in 
New York 
could not have it, 
could not find it in their hearts to belie
ve what I was talking about, I found it 
indescribable. It Œ it really was destroying 
to me. But I said at that point in time, I 
would not Œ I would not play with
 a Jewish child again, period. 
Q: When  did your mo th
er come over to 
United States
? 
A: Well, after about Œ living here in 
New York
 for about, I would say maybe eight, 
nine months or so, my  aunt and uncle here in 
New York
 had a rather small 
apartment, and actually my  Œ my  bed was 
a collapsible one that was set up in the 
kitchen. And it became more a
nd more difficult for my aunt
 and uncle to take care 
of me, I think financially as well. And an 
uncle Œ another uncle 
of mine, during this 
time period had Œ had gone
 Œ had emigrated from 
Berlin
 to
 London
 and then from 
London
 to  
California
, and it was decided th at I would move to 
California
. And I 
did something th at probably  no 10 year
 old had ever done before, and probably 
never will, I flew Œ my uncle
 paid for me to fly to 
California
, and th Œ and to  fly to 
California
 in the year 1940 was 
a Œ was something, very, 
very, very exceptional. 
Took about almo st 18 hours to fly to Œ from 
New York
 to
 California
. My uncle, as 
I said, had been a successful lawyer. He
 had a very lovely apartment in Œ in 
Los 
Angeles
. I was enrolled in school in 
Los Angeles
. My uncle had a Œ had some 
wonderful, well-to-do friends. I learned how
 to live a little bit again, I learned how

to smile ag ain, a little bit. My Œ my  uncle 
was Œ was a Œ had a great love of classical 
mu sic which I Œ wh ich I Œ not ad opted, bu
t wh ich came off Œ 
which rubbed off on 
me, which I also, I think received from my fa
ther, going back  in time. He too, had a 
great love of classical music. And Œ but I 
did learn something in
 addition to that. I 
learned how to live Œ I learned how to  ta
lk with people, and I learned something 
about finance in my Œ in that early age, 
because I Œ my  Œ my  uncle would be glued 
to the Œ to the Œ to the radio every afternoo
n to listen to the outcome of the financial 
markets. And from that, I would listen to my
 uncle with Œ with 
bated breath, as to 
what was going on in the financial mark
ets Œ didn™t understand it that well, but 
became very interested in it, and I believe 
because of that interest, it undoubtedly 
sparked my further interest into seeing what
 went Œ what was out in this Œ in this 
world, which had served my  uncle so we
ll, and which ultimately has served our 
family well, because that Œ 
that became my profession.

America

things of that sort. But it was fantastic, seeing 
America

Q: Did you feel that you felt differently

Americans, or was that

 though I am not afraid of anything, I 
am Œ I am very tenuous about th

 going to say, or what I 
might say or not say and do. But it will be an
 exciting evening, and we do have a Œ a 
substantial number of people coming to th at dinner. 
A2: A record number. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you went back  to 
New York
. What happened next? 
A: When I came back to 
New York
, we moved Œ wh en  I say Œ at that point, my  
mother took an apar
tment in Œ in uptown 
Washington Heights
. It™s an Œ an area 
known as really 
Inwood
. 
Inwood
, 
Washington Heights
. My mother went to work 
doing factory wo rk. Had never done this Œ ha
d never done the kind of work th at she 
was now doing. She was work ing 10 - 12 h
ours a night, in the mo st menial position, 
to sustain us. And I moved into  the apartm
ent Œ we moved into an  apartment house, 
I said, in 
Inwood
. And there were many families, like families of our Œ called 
refugee status, or whatever. And I formed 
a bond with  three other boys, very  close 
in age proximity, not all having gone throug
h a similar type of ex perience that I had 
to undergo, but boys that also 
had fled with their families from 
Germany
. And we 
formed a very close bond, and we calledourselves the boys of 1815, because it was 

1815 
Riverside Drive
. And it was Œ unfortunately, the 
last one of those boys Œ the

last one is me, but the last other one pa
ssed on last year, which was a very sad 
event. And we would wo
rk together in the 
Catskills
 and 
Fleischmanns
, 
New York
. 
We made our first Œ first money, we becam
e rich, at least tho Œ so we thought, 
earning 500 bucks for the Œ 500
 dollars for the season, in 50 cent and dollar tips. 
But it gave us our first entry into  earning some money. 
Q: What year was this? When 
did you earn your first dollar? 
A: I would say Œ I would say the minute Œ I 
Œ I would say, when  I was 14. I Œ I told 
Œ I told a Œ the Œ the hotel Œ hotel people
 I was 16. I did. I Œ cause you weren™t 
supposed to work at that time Œ at that Œ 
at that age yet. You 
could not get work  Œ 
not get work ing papers, but
 still you weren™t Œ you were only supposed to work 
limited number of hours, and you had to fu
dge the truth. Not lie, fudge the truth. 
There™s a difference. So we 
Œ we work ed in  Œ in Œ in  
Fleischmanns New York
. It 
was a hell of an experience, and we Œ we
 gained financial independence from our 
parents, which was very important. 
Q: I suppose you were aware of the fact that 
America
 had entered into the war? 
A: Yes. 
Q: How did you feel about that? 
A: We followed the n Œ the Œ th e news of 
America™s
 involvement in the war. I 
probably  could Œ could show you the maps
 of what was happening with greater

accuracy than any otherAmerican, because I knew 
Europe
. What I could not quite 
understand, is at the onset of the war, wh
ich was still the Œ the end of the Great 
Depression here in this country, and people
 again in th is country, who really did not 
quite fathom the depravity 
that had occu rred in Œ in 
Euro pe
, and how bad Œ how 
badly things had gotten, and the reason I 
really mention this, because there were 
still people here in 
America
 that were striking for be
nefits. And looking back on Œ 
on the scene now, I coul
d understand what was ha
ppening here. People were 
concerned about eking out a living here. Th
ey were Œ they were more concerned 
about that until really the onset Œ once war 
broke out, then I think the country really 
became Œ became Œ the country became unified
 as nothing I™d ever
 seen before, the 
same way as it would happen in 
England
. 
Q: Were you able to be in touch with anyone back in 
Germany
 during those years, 
or al-all ties were severed at that Œ 

A: All ties were severed. All ties were se
vered. I did have family remaining in 
England
, and I would say contact was at best
 intermittent. Letter writing was still 
something th at went on, and 
Œ and who wants to write le

Œ we went back Œ we had been
 back Œ we™ve gone back  to

 rather quickly, I 
would say probably  within five or six year
s at the end of the war. We™ve been back 
to
 Berlin
, I would say at least Œ at least ever
y two years™ time, from the 50s on, and 
as recently as Œ as th
e Œ the commemoration of 
Kristallnacht
, the 70
th
 anni-
anniversary. We Œ we were in Œ in  
Berlin 
with Chancellor

 at the

children Œ I shouldn™t say my children, I to
ok my  daughter Œ we have three children, 
I took my daughter, my son-
in-law. They had been  to 
Berlin
 with me previously. 
And I also took one of th
eir children who was free at that time, a young lady. And 
we went to the ceremony. That Œ th at was a

that ceremony was all aided by the consul
 general™s office, who we got to know 
very closely during that time period as an
 extremely fine gentleman. And he aided 
us to make sure that we were included 
in that Œ in that ceremony. Wh en I say 
included, being able to attend that cerem
ony. And we spen t a day with Œ with our 
children, showing th em where our synagogue
 had been , what had transpired, and I 
stood at Œ at the site where my  synagogue
 was, where there is now a large bronze 
plaque, which I say unashamedly 
is there because I asked the 
[indecipherable]

. There had been a Œ there ha

years ago I had contacted the 
Berlin 
authorities, asked them to renew that plaque 
with an Œ with one that 
really was more mean ingful
, which they did almo st 
immediately. Germans are the Œ are the most
 thorough people, and the mo st Œ they 
are the most willing to Œ to please, and 
they are most willing 
to understand what 
transpired. Chancellor 
Merkel
 spoke at Œ at that ceremony sp oke about the past, 
Jewish relationship, the present, of neve
r having something like th at again, spoke 
about the future, of Œ of Isr
aeli German relationship and of the danger of the Iranian 
situation. So  she covered all the bases,
 spoke eloquently about them. And I again 
saw Chancellor 
Merkel
 in a rather small ceremony, ro ughly about a month ago, 
when  I was asked to attend a ceremony at the 
Leo Beck Institute
 in 
New York 
City
, where Chancellor 
Merkel
 was given the 
Leo Beck
 Medal of Freedom, which 
is a very high co mmendation. And I 
later found out that ch Œ that 
Leo Beck
, a 
wonderful, distinguished rabbi, theologian, 
rabbi, was the guest speaker in 1930 at 
the synagogue that I™d men
tioned to you previously, my
 synagogue was inaugurated 
by cha Œ by chancellor 
Leo Œ 
Rabbi
 Leo Beck
, which I found an absolutely

Q: So, I™d like to know a

A: Yeah, well, at Œ at that time, in  Œ in

 joy on my part when I heard that 
Dresden 
was Œ 
was carpet firebombed, that 
Berlin
 was firebombed, that other cities were 
firebombed. Remember, I was in Œ in Œ in 
England
 when  
Coventry 
was leveled,

okay? And I saw 
Lo ndo n 
being leveled, and 
Coventry  
being leveled because there 
was a church there they wanted to Œ to 
bomb . So I had no Œ I had ab solutely zero  
compassion, zero heart. I wanted 
to  see as mu ch destruction of 
Germ any

possible, as mu ch destruction. And the firs
t Œ the first time that we were back in 
Germany
, you know, you Œ I could

amputated limbs. And I knew what were 
they from, they we

Either they Œ either
 they had fought in the war, th

they had been com Œ had been civilia

you had no co mp assion fo r them, yet you went

 five or six years after the war. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What was your mo tivation to  go back ? 

A: I survived. I had survived . I am not a religious Jew, but I will tell you, ev ery time 

that we go back to
 Berlin

 Berlin
 is over the 
Sabbath. And I insist that we always, 
that anybody who™s w

you also something special. There™s a

the

result, the synagogue was 
ransacked, but not burned do
wn, because had it been 
torched, buildings and surro
unding buildings would have
 also gone down ; they 
weren™t going to  do that. I found out later on here in the

that was a synagogue that my uncle, a Œ 
a brother of my  father, had been the 
president of in 1930s. And from a diary,
 from a written  diary of my grandfather, 
that my  grandfather wrote that he celebrated his 75

A2: Wh en  we were in

Christian, okay? They 
are so important in my life. A Ch

area had set up a storefront and bo
arded it up and put
 on a Star of 
David
, and c-call 
it
 Jude
, and Œ and desecrated the fr
ont of a Œ of a storefront as a kind of a replica as 
to what we had endured during that time 
period. And I found that touching. And as 
my  Œ my  wife said, on the lampposts ar
ound Œ around the park wh ere we lived, 
there were signs as to what had transpired 
against Jews in that period. What I also 
found very interesting is that two bloc
