Question: This is a United States Holocaust
 Memorial Museum in
terview with Charles 
Barber; Jason DeRose, interviewer.  Toda
y is August 9th, 1996, and we're in 
Washington, D.C.  This is tape 1, side A. 
Could you please say for me
 your name at birth, 
your birthdate, and your place of birth.
 
Answer: Sure.  My name is Charles Barb
er.  I was born in Budapest in 1932.
 

Q: Could you tell me some of your ear
liest memories of ch
ildhood growing up in 
Budapest?
 
A: The time I was born, my  father was runni
ng a liquor store and we were living in the 
back of the store, and when 
I was about 5 years old my  pare
nts sold the store, and they  
moved in to a building which was originally  ow
ned by my  gran dparents.  And th ey left 
one third of that building to  me and two thirds
 to two of their sons.  And we lived there 
when  I was 5 years old on.  My  earliest me
mory, I would like to talk about that just 
before I was going to grade school, one of 
my friends in the building said, oh, I know 
someone who will go to  the same class as you do
, but he will never talk to you.  I said, 
why not?  Said his father is an officer in th
e army, and they wouldn't 
talk to a Jew.  And 
this came really as a shock to me, you know. 
 I didn't know th at    why an ybody wouldn't  
want to talk to me.  So this is my earliest
 recollection that it was something wrong to be a 
Jew in Hungary.  And even when
 I went to school, I found that person, and he never, ever 
said a word to me.  And somehow I had the 
feeling that when so
mebody is an army 
 
officer, it might be a danger to me. Then I di
dn't  really have too mu ch trouble with my  
other classmates in school, but 
when we started to go to diffe
rent    to learn religion, 
which was    everybody had to take religion in school. 
 
Q: Was this a private school or a public school?
 
A: No.  Public school.  It was a public school, 
but it    everybody had to take religion.  So 
the Catholic kids went to a Catholic, you know , and we went to learn Judah    to learn 

Judaism and learn the Hebrew alphabet.  An d 
from then on, my  relationship with the non 
Jewish students started  to get bad.  They    
one of    one of my classmates said that, you 
people killed Christ.  I knew I didn't, you know, 
so ... But that's how it started, really, to 
be bad in school.
 
Q: Were there other Jewish st
udents at the school with you?
 
A: There were several,  yes.  But there were not enough to have relig
ious studies just for 
us, so we were meeting from other class, 
you know, and -- to make
 up en ough students.  
 
The only thing I can rememb er now, when  the war broke out, it was 1939, and I 

remember when the first bomb, which was dr
opped in Budapest, it was seven odd blocks 
from our building.  And I later heard that it wa
s really dropped by th
e Germans, and they 
said it was the Serbians to br
ing in Hungary into the war 
against Yugoslavia.  And my 
father then was called in for labour duty. 
 
Q: How old were you at this time?
 
A: I was born in '32.  I was about 7 or 8. 
 
Q: How did that affect your family, 
your father being called into th e war?
 

A: My mo th er origin ally was making    was a 
tailor    yeah, a tailor, and she was sewing  
 
at home to make a living fo r us.  But I knew th
at, you know, my mother    my father went 
in, and I knew that ma ny othe
r people were called in, so it 
was not discrimination, you 
know, I felt, although my father wasn't ha
ving a weap on, and he had a yellow arm band 
which showed, you know, that 
he's a Jewish labour camp, y
ou know, memb er.  The first 
bad thing wh at happened in th
e family, my father had a young
er brother.  He became    I 
don't know    a Catholic or Luth eran or someth
ing, and he felt that that way he can have it 
easier.  And he volunteered to the labour ca
mp .  The only difference it was from my  
father that instead of a yellow arm band, th
ey had a wh ite arm band, but they  did the 
same thing.  And wh en they marched into Ru
ssia, the Hungarian an d German troops, they 
sent him there.  And in about tw
o months we got a note that he
 died.  So this was the first 
real shock, you know, 
what happened to us.
 
Q: And how old were you at that time?
 
A: I would say 10.  10 or 11.
 
Q: Do you have any early me
mories of your father at 
home, sort of family life?
 
A: He    at that time he 
came home, you know, for a few days.  And one time he was sick 
and he was home for a few months, but it was not a normal family life, no.
 
Now I am thinking.  In about 1943, it had to
 be, my mother got a telegram from Gestapo 
that    I don't know the exact 
time, 24 or 48 hours    she mu
st go to  the headquarters at 
Hotel Majestic.  I don't know
 why they did that.  Maybe
 somebody in the building 
reported that maybe we were listening to BBC 
or    I don't know.  But she called up one 
of her sisters.  She had two sisters living 
in Hungary.  One marri
ed a Gentile, and sh e 
became a Gentile herself, you know.  And after sh
e left h o me to go to  the Hotel Majestic, 
the sister's husband, who was 
a Gentile, picked me up and to
ok me to a woman who used 
to do housework for them.  And 
she left me there.  And I have a feeling    he left me 
there.  I have a feeling that they 
probably gave her mo ney to keep  me. 
 
Q: Was she Jewish?
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No? So was that the la
st time you saw your mother? 
 
A: No.  I will come to it.  Then later on    
I don't know how many months later, you know    
the Jews had to wear a star, a Jewish star, a
nd that woman got scared 
to keep me.  So my 
uncle by marriage came, picked me up, and to
ok me to another relative who were Jewish.  

And by that time the buildings 
had a Jewish star on it. Oh, one thing I wanted  to mention 
what happened before
 I left our house.  One of my
 friends came to me -- I had a 
collection of picture cards -- and said, wh
y don't you give it to me?  Whatever will 
happen to  you, you will have no use to have 
those cards.  You know, and this really got to 
my  mind, you know.  I didn't answer, you kn
ow, because I was afraid. So, anyway, I go 
back to it, that I -- I was take n to the relative of mine.  A
nd a few weeks later my mother 
was taken to a Hungarian camp which was ca
lled    I    I say it in the Hungarian 
pronunciation    Kistarcsa.  That was a camp  for -- I don't know -- political prisoners or 

criminals.  I really don't know.  And th ey
 let her out after    I don't know how many 
months. Maybe eight months.  And sh e came to
 me, to this building,
 to live there with 
that relative. And I remember one day the leader 
of Hungary     his name is Horthy    made 
a radio speech that Hungary lost the war, so
 did Germany, and we 
stop every fighting.  
And, oh, we were so happy, you know.  We 
thought that we will no
w survive.  By the 
evening, the biggest Hu ngarian Nazi took over
 the government, and several days later my 
mo ther told me we are going to  move to anot
her house. We went to
 another house with a 
yellow star, which was very near to  wh ere her Ch
ristian sister lived.  And her other sister 
was there too.  I don't reme mb er how many da
ys we were there.  One thing I remember 
which makes me feel very bad, th at I told 
my  mo ther that I am hungry, and she didn't 
answer, you know.  No food.  Anyway, one mo
rning around 4 o'clock, a bunch of Nazis 
with arm bands came to the building and th ey made
 their gong, what they
 u s ed  w h en  th e    
the air raids came, you know, and they sa
id, every Jew come downstairs to the 
courth ouse.  We went there, and we had to 
stand in  one line, and th ey  made two groups 
from that line.  Before I was separated from 
my mother, she handed me whatever money 
she had, and she couldn't look at me.  They took
 her away.  That's  the last I ever saw her.  
She was with her sister .  About 
two days later, my Christian 
uncle came into the building, 
which was locked, an d told me he would try to
 take me somewhere.  At first, you know, 
we took a streetcar, and he tried to put me  
  how you call it where the Catholic priests are 

living?  I    I    
 
Q: A monastery?
 
A: Some kind of a monastery.  
And th ey wouldn't  take me.  
So he took me back to the 
build ing. The next following day he came again, 
and he took me to a building which was    
I would say the Hungarian ring, you know, a ma
in thoroughfare.  It had a Swedish flag.  
And he deposited me there.
  That's where I stayed. 
 
Q: In the building you were living at befo
re you moved to the 
Sw edish build ing, who 
were you living there with?
 
A: Whom I was living with?  I was in that 
house alone till after they took my mother 
away.  I have to acknowledge that one Chris
tian family fed me one evening.  They knew 
what happened, and they took me and fed me. 
 But I was alone for about two, three days. 
 

Q: And how old were you?
 
A: I was 12.  12 years old.  This is already 
'44.  It was about in Novemb er.  We could 
hear the Russian artillery  in the evening, they 
were so near.  So later on I heard that that 
build ing had something to do with (?troulvo
nneberg?), and there was a man standing in  
front with  a Nazi arm band, whom I hated,  and later I found out he was Jewish, you 
know.  So after I saw the first Russian, I cam
e out, and I was so weak.  We had no food. 
 
Q: How long were you 
in the Swedish house?
 
A: From November, December, for the  
  may b e the second week of January.
 
Q: Can you tell me about living in th
at house?  Who was there with you?
 
A: Children.  There was one person who I thi nk was a rabbi, and I reme mb er he tried to 
teach some children Judaism.  
But they were so hu
ngry that the only 
thing was in their 
mind to eat. And we got a slice of bread every 
day, and sometimes we 
got a little beans.  
That's  all.  So by the time the 
Russians came  in, I was re ally 
starved.  And after I saw the 
first Russian, I went    oh, one thing I forg
ot.  I was very, very hungry, and one day I 
sneaked out from that bui
ld ing, and I had seen on the wa
ll a warning:  Any Jew found on 
the street o u tside the ghetto w
ill be killed on the spot.  And I 
am reading it, and I tried to 
sneak back  to that house to find some food. 
 And I went back.  An d, you know, it was so 
near to my  aunt who was a Christian, you 
know, and her husband, and I wouldn't go there 

because I knew that I would brin
g danger to them.  So I went back to that apartment, and 
I found one jar of marmalade, 
which I took.  And I went back
 to the building, you know.  
And on the way back, another 
kid about my  age stops me, looks at me and says, aren't 
you a Jew?  How can you be on the street?  M y  
   I thought my heart 
will jump out.  I just 
kept walking without looking back.  
Noth ing happened , you know, but    
 
Q: How old was this other person?
 
A: Could have been the same age as me. 
 
Q: 11?
 
A: About.  11, 12.  And the    at that 
time there were so many 
caricatures of Je wish 
profiles that I guess he just recognized my  no
se, that I must be Jewish.  And I was lucky 
he didn't scream too, he is a Jew, because
 I don't know what   
 you know, they would 
have killed me.
 
Q: Were there a lot of other people on the streets?
 
A: Not too many, because by th at time Russi
an mortars were coming down, you know, 
on the city.  But there were people.  There 
were people.  Not too many.  And you could 
see bombed out buildings, and you could see in
to homes, that people didn't go down  to 

the baseme nt and th ey were de
ad, you know.  But that happene
d to everybody that time.  
Not only to us.
 
Q: Besides the rabbi in the Swedish house, 
do you rememb er any specific people?  Did 
you talk to other people
 in the Swedish house? 
 
A: I can't recall by name.  There was, you know
, two or three boys that I got, you know, 
talking to, but I really do
n't remember their name. 
 
Q: What did you ta
lk to them about?
 
A: About our parents, our family, about food.
  You know that after the war, for years 
when  I saw people eating, I was drooling lik
e    I don't know you heard of Pavlov dog, 
you know?  I just looked at some
body eating, and I was drooling.  
 
So after the war, I went back
 to my aunt, who survived. 
 
Q: The Gentile?
 
A: Yes.  They were not that good to me. 
 
Q: Can you tell me    b efore you tell me a
bout going back to your aunt, can you tell me 
about actually seeing the Russian  troops come and liberate?
 
A: Sure.  Sure.  I    not only the Russian tr
oops.  At one day, we 
were in the basement, 
and build ings, you know, were co
nnected to  each other; so if one collapsed, it can go to 
the next building.  And a group of Nazi sold
iers went through that
 building, and they 
were regular soldiers.  And wo
uld you believe that one of th
em gave two or three candies 
out to Jewish children?  I wasn 't
 lucky to get one, but I saw him. 
 
Q: Were these Russian soldiers?
 
A: These were Germans. 
 
Q: Germans.  
 
A: They were Germans.  But y
ou asked me about the Russians.
 
Q: Hold on one moment. [Tap
e turned over] This is th
e United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum interview with
 Charles Barber.  This is 
tape 1, side B. You were 
going to  say about seeing the Russ
ian troops for the first time.
 
A: Sure.  Sure.  The first wave of Russian tr
oops were not Europeans.  They were, most 
of them, Asiatic.  It looked like that althou
gh th ey talked  about equality, the first wave, 
which were in the biggest danger, they didn't
 send the European s, you know.  Bu t I loved 
them, you know.  They     they
 were really stealing, robbing,
 raping, but at least they 
didn't  discriminate against us, 
you know.  So th ey did that 
to everybody.  Bu t the second 

wave which came in, they were
 Europeans.  And when I we
nt over to my  aunt, about 
three of them came into the 
apartment, and one of them was Jewish, and believe it or not, 
my Christian aunt could speak a little Yiddish 
and was talking to the Jewish soldier.  And 
he said, I don't care what happens, I am here 
now, I will not stop till I get to Berlin.  You 
know?  And I rememb er they set up antiaircraf
t batteries every corner because then the 
Germans started to come and bomb.  But as I to
ld you, no matter what they did, as far as I 
was concerned, they  couldn't do anything bad. 
I don't know wh at else can I tell you.  
After the war, you know, my  aunt first 
gave me out to the Red Cross.  
 
Q: Your Christian aunt?
 
A: Yes.  I was there for about three months.  
They sent me back.  A few months later sh e 
sent me to an orphanage wh ich was run by a 
Zionist organization in another city.  And I 
remember in that city that I 
   my  mo th er h ad so me co u sin
s living, and wo
uld you believe 
it, I found them?  They just 
came  back fromTheresienstadt, 
and about a month later they 
took me out from the orphanage, and ab out two 
months    yeah, they took me out from 
the orphan age, and th en  I finished high sch
ool there.  And then th ey decided to  go to  
Israel.  And I returned to Buda
pest, and I went to wo rk in a big factory, wh ich was in the 
news recently because General Mo
tors bought that factory that 
I worked, Tungsram, and    
 
Q: So where was it that you were 
when you were in high school?
 
A: It was called the town of Szeg
ed.  It's famous for 
paprika.  Yes, that's where    I was 
there maybe a year and a half, and then I went
 back to Budapest.  And it looked like they 
thought I had too much    more ability than to work 
in the factory, and they sent me back 
to school. 
 
Q: Who sent you?  The supervisors of the factory?
 
A: The factory.  And then I went to law sc
hool.  And came 1956, the revolution.  I had 
guns, you know?  We all had guns.  And then
 a man comes in, an older man, and they  
said, boys, I think you need some pointers wh
at we should do.  He said, you know th at 
who brought about the communists?  The Jews.  I had a gun in  my  pocket, and I had the 
urge, the shooting.  I didn't.  But I decided 
the first chance I get, I get out from there.  
And then I came to America.
 
Q: So did th is happen while
 you were in law school or 
had you finished law school?
 
A: I was in law school.  I was in my third 
year of law school when  it happened .  And I 
never finish ed that.  Came the revolution, and th
e    I took a train near to the border, and I 
just walked to Austria.  And I had an uncl
e, my father's brother, wh o wanted to  be a 
doctor back in Hungary.  But 
because they had a law, which 
is called ﬁnumerus clausus,ﬂ 
they would take only a certain 
amount of Jews.  He couldn't
 get in.  So he could go to 
Vienna, but he had to  sign that after he be
comes a doctor he cannot practice in  Austria.
 

So he couldn't practice in Au st
ria, couldn't practice in Hungary .  He came to America.  So 
I went to him when I came out.
 
Q: So was he here for a while before y
ou were here, before 
you came to America?
 
A: He came to    out in '38. 
 
Q: Oh, okay. 
 
A: In 1938, just before the war.  And    
 
Q: So how did you go about leaving Hungary?
 
A: Believe it or not, I just
 walked through the border. 
 
Q: Into Austria?
 
A: Into Austria. 
 
Q: And then  how did you ge
t from Austria to America?
 
A: In Au stria they already set up the Red 
Cross, you know, camps for fleeing Hungarians, 
and they  allowed me to send a telegram anywhere
 in the world, and I sent it to my uncle.  
And he told me, come.  And I came out in a 
   it didn't cost me money, you know.  
America to ok in, I think, 20,000 Hungarians, a
nd we came in a World War II    not World 
War II    Korean war troop carrier, ship.  And we came to Camp Kilmer, and my uncle 
picked me up at Camp Kilmer.  A nd    
 
Q: What did you do wh en yo
u got to the United States?
 
A: I went to wo rk.  And later on I went ba
ck to school, and I became an accountan t.
 
Q: So you decided not 
to finish law school?
 
A: You see, there are two different type of 
law systems.  In Europe, they use Napoleonic 
Code.  In America, they ha
ve the British common law.  So
 I couldn't get no credit for 
anything.  So I -- it was easier to became [sic
] an accountant.  And 
I was working during 
the day and went to college at night. 
 
Q: Where did you work  during the day?
 
A: I worked at a transportation compan
y, wh ich since went out of business. 
 
Q: And where did you go to school?
 
A: I went to first Queensborough Community  Co
llege; then I went to Bernard Baruch in 
New York. 
 
Q: And you studied accounting there?
 

A: Yes. 
 
Q: Once you graduated from ther
e, where -- what did you do?
 
A: I worked at the same 
company as an accountant.
 
Q: At what company?
 
A: It was called ABC Transnational Transport.
  We had a terminal
 out in Washington, 
D.C., too.  And I worked about 30 years there, 
the same company. I   
 the first time I got 
married was about seven years ago.  I never 
got married before.  You know, I never quite 
got over, you know, wh at happened.  There we
re some people wh o could pick up th eir 
life, you know, like nothing happened.  It was 
not the same with me .  As of today, you 
know, I wake up at night and have nightmar
es.  So I think I was about -- functioning 
about sometimes 70 percent, 80 percent, and I 
still made it, you know?  But I don't think I 
ever was 100 percent, you kn
ow, my adult life.  But I gu
ess even the 70 percent I was 
able to finish my education and work.  If th
ey kept me for 30 years, I mu st have done 
something right.
 
Q: Where did you meet your wife?
 
A: I knew one of her relatives who got very  
sick, and I offered to take her radiation 
treatment, an old lady, and she knew that sometim
es I lik ed to go out 
to the races.  And 
my  wife just lost about a year ago her firs
t husband.  And she introduced me to her.  And 
I took her out to the racetrack, you know, an
d she had a somewhat similar background.  
She was born in Vien na, which is not too far 
from Budapest.  And wh
en the Germans, the 
Anschluss came, she escaped wi
th  her parents to Yugoslavi
a.  And that's where she 
survived.  So we had a 
lot    a lot in common.
 
Q: Can I ask you a few questions about back  during the war now?
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: Were you raised in a religious household?
 
A: My parents were not very religious.  My 
father was somewhat religious.  His family 
were kosher, but he wasn't.  And my  mo ther
 wasn't very religious, but, you know, I 
studied religion in school, and I remember 
lighting candles Friday night, and I prayed  
every night when I was a child 
till age 14.  And when I lost 
my parents, I lost my faith.
 
Q: Were you bar mitzvah'd?
 
A: You know where I was when  I was bar mi
tzvah'd?  I mentioned before -- when I 
should have had my  bar mitzvah.  I told you 
that my aunt send to the Red Cross.  They 
gave me out to peasants, and the day I would 
have had my  bar mitzva
h I was herding pigs 
in a field.  How could I have
 had a bar mitzvah?  Those people didn't even know wh at it 

is.  And my aunt certainly didn't  care at th
at point.  And I liked her husband much better, 
who was Ch ristian.  He was a good man, but 
unfortunately my  aunt
 wore the pants and 
not him.  I don't think he woul
d have given me away.  But she 
did.  I have a feeling that 
there was a certain rivalry, sibling rivalry,
 between my mother an
d her, you know.  Bu t 
the only thing th at my  mo ther didn't go by hers
elf.  She had her youngest sister with her.  
And as of today, I don't knowwhat happened to her.  I knew 
what happened to  my  father.  
I was still at my aunt when someone came to
 the apartment and my  aunt sent me out, and 
later she told me that this 
man is a survivor and was ther
e when my fath
er died in 
north ern Hu ngary    northwestern Hungary , a
nd he brought a picture to prove it.  And 
then my aunt told me that 
if I go to the Jewish cemetery,
 they brought back all the 
remains of the people who died in that ca
mp , and they  put up a memorial.  And I went 
there, and I saw my father's 
name in the memorial.  And sh
e also claimed that someone 
saw my mother and her siste r 
the day before Bergen Belsen 
was liberated.  But she never 
came home.  But I know that many people died 
even after the liberati
on.  So th at's my  
story.
 
Q: Have you been  back  to Europe 
at all since you left in the '50s?
 
A: One time. 
 
Q: Where did you go?
 
A: We went first to Vienna, and we went to 
see my  wife's old building wh ere she used to 
live.  Then we went to Budapest.  And I 
went to see the build ing wh ich I owned one 
third, you know, and they took
 away from me.  They can keep
 it, you know.  Then I went 
to see my  Christian aunt's da
ughter, who is my first co usin
, and when I knocked on the 
door, she acted like she didn't know me.
 
Q: Had you known her 
when you were young?
 
A: Sure.  I lived with her for 
quite a while.  I guess she    th
ey expected that when I came 
to America, the country of gold, 
I will make them rich.  {Laughs}
 
And she just didn't want to talk to me.  In
 fact, her husband said, you don't know them?  
And she said, oh, we met before.  So I look
ed at her.  I said, God bless you.  And I 
walked away.  So    
 
Q: Did you go to see the -- where -- the site 
of the Sw edish safe house that you were in?
 
A: We walk ed by it, yes.  And 
I pointed out, my wife, that th
at's where I survived.  And I 
showed all the places where I used
 to live in Budapest, yes.  
And we went to the building, 
and there was a store in the building, a tobacco 
store, and I went inside and I talked to th e 
present owner, and I to ld her, 
the person who owned this stor
e before you wasn't a very 
nice person.  And I showed, right here she ke
pt a big, big picture of Rommel till he was 

winning in Africa.  Then when
 he started to lose, she took
 it off, the picture {laughs}.  
And, you know, I    she was a 
me mb er of the Nazi party.  And I am not sure if she didn't 
cause my  mo ther's arrest, you kno
w, because she was a big Nazi.
 
Q: So where else did you go when 
you were in Europe visiting again?
 
A: Really, I don't know anybody.  I had a friend 
in  law school, and I couldn't locate him.  
I had his name in the phone book, but when  
I called up, it was a lawyer's office, and he 
wasn't working there anymore.  And my  wife wa
nted to leave fast.  
So we just went for 
another week to Lake Balaton.  We just to
ok a week vacation at Lake Balaton, and we 
came back.  We drove back to 
the    Munich, where we re
nted the car originally, and 
came back.  And we both decided after a wh
ile that that's all 
for us for Europe.
 
Q: Are you glad you went back?
 
A: Somehow I am, that before I die, you know
, I went back to that building where they 
took my mother, with 
a camera to take a picture of th
at spot.  And somebody walks by, 
and they  says, that's not a tourist place to take
 a picture.  And I said, but this place means 
something to  me to ma ke a picture, you kno
w?  It was an old building, and somebody 
sees obviously an American.  To take a picture,
 it sounded    you know?  And    oh, and I 
took my wife to a place.  I said I want to
 go to a little place wher
e they have excellent 
cake, because my mother took me there once, yo
u know.  It was still 
in business, and we 
went there.  So for this little
 remembrance, I was glad I went back.  But I wouldn't want 
to go back again.
 
Q: You said that your first c
ousin was not happy to see you. 
 Did you get the feeling that 
there was a lot of anti Semitism still in 
Budapest and in Hungary in general?
 
A: Oh, yes.  I have no question about it.  In
 fact, it came to my 
mind that she married a 
man whose name sounded very 
aristocratic, and I wouldn't 
be surprised that she didn't 
want    she doesn 't -- h e doesn't k n ow that 
she 's half Jew ish, and, you know, it came to 
my mind that this is w hy sh e didn't want to 
acknowledge me, that she was afraid that her 
aristocratic husband will find ou
t that she is half Jewish a
nd will divorce her.  And when I 
took a cab to the cemetery 
-- you know, the only cemetery  I can go to    to my 

grandparents, and so I went to see my  grandpar
ents.  And when I told 
the cab driver that I 
want to go to the Jewish ceme
tery, he looked  at me, you know
    you know what it is 
having an  antenna?  My antenna 
said that's an anti Semite 
too, you know. And one other 
thing I wanted to tell you, you kn
ow, this is    with all thos
e things happening to me, that 
being Jewish, you know, felt like being    
I don't know what.  Do  you know that for a 
long time, when someb
ody asked me, are you a Jew, the bl
ood rushed up to my face like 
I was caught in -- my  hand in
, you know, the cookie jar, or being a criminal, you know?  
It took me a long time, you know, to look somebod
y in the eye and say, yes, I am.  It took 

me a long time.  And it's so stupid.  Even th e God whom they pray  was born a Jew.  And 
I had to be ashamed, you 
know.  It's ridiculous.
 
Q: Have you ever gone back to Israel?
 
A: I never been in Israel.  And maybe I will tr
y to talk into my wife.  You know, she    
she's so much afraid of viol
ence, you know.  She's just t h
e opposite of me.  You know, 
with me, after what I went th
ro ugh, you know, I am not afra
id of anything, you know.  
The bombing.  Every moment, you 
know, you could be killed.  If not by the bombs, but 
by th e Nazis.  But she's afraid, you know.  Bu t I    I will try to talk 
her into it one of these 
days.  I would like to go there to see Israel.
 
Q: How aware of you    how aware were yo
u of the creation of Israel around the time -- 
you were already in the United States?
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No?  You were in Hungary. 
 
A: Sure.  What was it?  In '52. 
 
Q: Yeah, in the early '5 0s.  So -- and you came to
 the United States in 
the mid to late '50s.  
So how    
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- how aware were you of what was going on in Israel?
 
A: Very well.  In fact, I was praying for Is
rael, and in th e beginning th e newspapers were 
sympathetic.  But later on they were very anti
 Zionist, you know.  
But, you know, in the 
beginning --

Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview w
ith Charles Barber.  
This is tape two, side A.
 
A: You know, I wanted to believe them beca
use they saved my  life.  But anybody who 
had any intelligence and was reading later 
on, you know, it was not a very logical 
ideology, and it didn't work , and it was cruel. 
 In fact, would you believe that later, you 
know, in the '50s, I was afraid
 to go back to the building wh
ere we originally were living 
because I owned one third of 
it, and th ey would have calle
d me a capitalist, you know?  
So I was actually afraid to go near to that building.  And th
en they asked what my father 

was.  I    I had to lie.  I said he was empl
oyed in  a liquor store as a bartender, because if I 
would have said he owned that liq
uor store, oh, forget it.  So in
 order to be able to go to 
law school, I had to peddle wh at th
ey wanted me to say, but I rea
lly wanted to  get out of    
from there as fast as I could.  
And in '56, I could.  I left my
 education and    and came out. 
And now I think I    even 
though I cannot forget, but my 
life i s very much normal.
 
Q: You were showing me the picture that yo
u have of your fathe
r.  Do you have any 
pictures of your mo ther?
 
A: I do.  And in  fact, I mentioned that my  mo th
er was take    the Gestapo arrested her and 
put her in a    gave her to a Hungarian camp. 
 I have a letter that she somehow was able to 
give to somebody and sent it to her sister, and 
I have that letter in my  packet.  It is written 
in toilet paper.  I    I can show it to you.  
Oh, you asked me about -- this was my mo ther 
and father, when they got married. 
 
Q: This is their wedding picture?
 
A: That's their wedding picture.  And look 
at this letter.  This was sent from that -- 
Kistarcsa to her sister, and she writes about me, 
to take care of me.  When  I read, I -- it's 
in Hu ngarian, you know -- my  heart is breaking. 
 
Q: Do you still speak Hungarian?
 
A: Sure.  Sure.  I was 23 when I came out. 
 
Q: What does the letter say?
 
A: She's thanking her sister   
 a p ackage, what she was sendi
ng to her, and she says that 
she feels very, very lonely without me and 
she's the one who gives me the strength to 
survive, and please take care of him and please ta
ke care of my     me too.  And sends her 

kisses to everybody, and    again, in the 
next little piece o f paper, again asked them to 
take care of me -- her sisters.  And in one 
corner, she writes, pleas
e pray for this, her 
sister    the same sister w
ith whom she was taken away .  And they  died togeth er.  I don't 
know what to do with
 th ese, you know.  I don't think 
that they could use these letter.  
What's    w h en I die, what will happen to it, 
you know.  I    I woul
d have given it to them, 
because how long will I live?  Nob
ody has any use for it.  I even have    this is a picture 
of the sister with whom she 
was killed -- this is the Chris
tian sister -- and this is her 
daughter who didn't recognize 
me.  And you remember I men
tioned the first casualty?  
That was him, my  father's youngest brothe
r, with the other brother who came to the 
United States. 
 
Q: The one who helped you when you    
 
A: Yes, when I came out.  Yes.  He died about ten years ago.
 

Q: Well, I'd  like to thank you very much.
 
A: Oh, if anybody, 10 years fro
m now or 50 years from now, le
arn    learns something, 
then maybe it was worth [sic].
