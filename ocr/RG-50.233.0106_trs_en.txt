 Testimony of Moses Rechnitz
 
 Interview conducted: July 12, 1992
 
 
000Born in Poland, June 3, 1923 in a town called KAT
OWICE.  Originally my fa mily lived in a 
town called BEDZIN, which was 
about 15 miles from KATOWI CE. 
 
 
A ma jor population of Jews and a 
smaller population of Poles.  It was by Polish standards, a 
pretty good sized city.  It had stre
et cars, it had stores, it had 
a ma in street, it had I believe a 
couple of movie houses.  It had an old castle th
at belonged some where in
 the Polish history.  
 
 
Where is Benzin near?
 
 
Bendzin is in the Southwestern part of Poland, a
bout 10 miles for m Katowice in Silesia, which is 
predominantly the coal and steelw
orks region of Poland.  It is al
so I think about 50 or 60 miles 
from Krakow, which is one of the oldest cities 
in Poland and is known as 
the University city of 
Poland.
 
 
Did you live with your mother and father?
 
 
I lived with my mother and fath
er on the third or fourth floor 
of a building.  I reme mber the 
water system was on top of the building and we were
 getting the water in our
 sinks and toilets by 
gravity.  It seemed like it was 
pumpe d to the top of the building.
 
 
And when did you move  from Bendz in?
 
 
We moved to Katowice where my father had a whol
esale leather store, in about 1930, I believe.  
It was a relativel y short trip between Bendzin an
d Katowice which one could take a train to and 
from, which took about 25 mi nutes of a ride.  Th
e town in between Bendzin and Katowice was 
Sosnowiecz, another town that was also populated by a lot of Jews.
 
 
What was your father's name ?
 
 
033 My father's na me  was Bernard, and they used to call him BEREK.
 

 
Did your father's  parents live in Benzin as well?
 
 
Yes, they did.  I reme mb er visiting them al most
 every saturday with the rest of my fa mily.
 
 
Do you remember their name s?
 
 
No. 
 
 
Do you remember your grandmother's on your fa ther's side's ma iden na me?
 
 
No.
 
 
On your mother's side, what was your mother's name ?
 
 
My mother's  name  was Rachel, and she was called Ruchla.  Her ma iden name  was Lejzerowitz.
 
 
And what about her parents?
 
 
I only reme mber her father, which was my grandfather, and his name  wa s Abraham Lejzerowitz. 
I don't reme mber my gra ndmother on that side be
cause I understand that originally my mother's 
mother died, and he rema rried again, and I do not reme mber his second wife's  na me .
 
 
We there relatives of your mother's  also in Bendzin?
 
 
Yes, there were relatives in Bendzin and that 
areaon my mother's side. 
 She had a brother who 
had two children.  I do not reme mber his name , a
nd my grandfather on my  mother's side, after he 
got rema rried, had a child whose name  was Fisie
k.  He was about my age.  I always joked, 
because everybody was telling me  that Fisiek was 
my uncle and he was really my own age.  I 
could never accept the fact 
that he was my uncle.
 
 

Did your mo ther have sisters?
 
 
057 Yes, my  mother had a sister
 by the name  of Pola.  She wa
s ma rried to my uncle, whose 
name  was Max Bolimowski.  And I know they 
had two children, one boy and one girl, and the 
boy's na me  was Ziggy and the girl's name  was Lusia.
 
 
Did your mo ther have any other sisters?
 
 
I don't reme mber.
 
 
So we know that your mother had one brother 
and a sister name d Pola, and you don't  reme mber 
the brother's name.
 
 
Right...
 
 
What became of your mother's sister
 and brother and their children?
 
 
As far as I reme mber during the war, before th
e war my uncl e , who was my mother's  brother, 
divorced or separated fro
m his wife, and he had two sons.  One son's name  was Vovek and the 
other's was Ebek.  Ebek was the older of the sons
, and before the war started he was forced to 
join the Polish army.  Vovek was a few years younger and because of the problem within the 
fa mily Vovek came to live with us for a couple of
 years in Katowice, when we moved there, in 
about 1930.
 
 
Vovek's last name  was Lejzerowitz?
 
 
Right, and he was a couple of years older than
 I was and we got along very well when he was 
living with us in Katowice .
 
 
What eventually became of
 Vovek to your knowledge?
 
 

Vovek survived the second world war, and I me t hi
m a couple of times afterwards.  He lived in 
Constance, Germany.  When I became  a ware that 
he was alive, I ma de a point to go and visit 
him.  He eventually emmigrat ed to Australia 
and he married a girl in Germany still who also 
survived the war and whose name , fi rst name  was Mirka...
 
 
Vovek's brother?
 
 
Vovek's brother, never surfaced after the end of
 WWII, and I believe that he must have... the 
rumor is that he died somewhere in Russia dur
ing the period of WWII.  Nobody heard from hi m 
again.  The same  goes for Fisiek.  Fi siek ran 
away when the Germans were advancing, he ran 
away towards the Russian border.  We heard fr
om hi m a couple of times through the mail, during 
the early part of WWII, but 
we never heard anything about him again, and I don't know what 
happened to him.
 
 
Let's talk about... if that is th
e end of your mother's side, wh
at about your father's side...
 
 
099 I don't reme mber how ma ny brothers or sister
s my father had, but I can think about one 
sister and one brother.  One brother was a furrier
 in Benzin and the sister's name  was Sala, and 
she was probably in her late 30's or early 40's when she... when a ma tchmaker found a husband 

for her.  And I reme mbe r  as a child of 10 or 12, 
that the wedding took pla
ce in our apartment in 
Katowice.  I also reme mber that when the war 
broke out, she was pregnant, and she did have a 
baby, and after that because of wh
atever happened during that period of time , she vanished, and I 
never heard what happened to her.  But I'm pretty
 sure that she died during the war, as did her 
husband.
 
 
Her name  was Sala Rechnitz, and you don't re me mber her ma rried name ?
 
 
No, I don't.
 
 
113  What about your father's brother?
 
 
I don't reme mber.  
 
 
Any other cousins, etc...
 

 
There was... Ok, my father had a sister, I don't re
me mber what her name was, she was married to 
an intelligent Jew... she lived in Sosnowiecz. 
 Her ma rried name  was Wi ederma n.  He  was the 
director of a high school [her husband, Fevek].  
Fevek was the director of a high school in 
Sosnowiecz that was attended only by Jewish chil
dren.  They had two children, one whose name  
was Oleg, and I don't reme mber the other one.  I know
 that all of them pe rished during the war, 
except my uncle Fevek, who wrote a book about th
e period during the war in Sosnowiecz.  He 
was hidden there for a number of years by a janitor of the high school.  And he survived the war 
and then came  to America and wrote the book.  It's  in the Library of Congress.
 
 
What about the grandparents?   
 
 
I do not remember much... my mother's father died 
before the war, and my  father's father lived 
with us at the beginning of the 
war  in Krakow, where we moved to before the very beginning of 

the war, and he died a natural death.  The 
rest of them I have absolutely no idea.
 
 
Let's talk about your mo ther, what wa s she like?
 
 
My mother was a very progressive wo man from 
what I can judge, now and even then... she was 
very active in Jewish organizati
ons like Hadassa and Wi so... she 
was very socially active, she 
belonged to a lot of philanthropic 
organizations and social organi
zations and she was really, in 
my opinion, very advanced in her thinking for that age.
 
 
Didn't you say some thing about your mother going to the world's fair in 1939?
 
 
Yes, in 1939, I believe, my mother went to the worl
d's fair in NY.  And after the trip to NY, she 
came back to Poland, we were ma king plans to emmigr
ate to Israel at that time.  My father was 
in the wholesale leather business in Katowice. 
 He was doing financiall
y very well and he was 
very respected in the community 
and contributed money and here 
and there he found hims elf in 
the position of having to help out
 some of the members of the family.  I became aware a couple 

of times that when he was walking home  from his businees, he got accost ed by some  Polish 

youth... and on a couple of occasions he either got 
beaten up or chased... or some thing like that.  
And I believe that that experi
ence prompted him to start maki
ng arrangements to leave Poland 
and emmi gr ate to Israel.
 
 
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
 

 
I have one sister who has gone to Israel in 1936.  Sh
e is five years older than I am.  He r name  is 
Genia, and she was at the last stages of getti
ng her musical education on piano, and she attended 
the conservatory in Tel Aviv.  A
nd lucky that she did because of th
e fact that she lived in Israel, 
she was really not caught up in WWI I .
 
 
And what was your childhood like, 
school and things like that?
 
 
177 My childhood seemed like a very trouble free ch
ildhood.  I was a very norma l, pretty strong 
kid, who ma naged to survive by hims elf, although 
there was no big question 
of survival in the 
early years.  But I mi xed very well with ev
erybody else, and after attending Polish grammar 
school and also a Jewish Cheder in Katowice, 
I started attending a Polish high school in which 
there were only like three or five Jewish pupils
.  I became aware of an
tisemitism at the early 
stage when one of my teachers st
arted ma king fun of me  because 
I had the same last name as 
another ma n who was building a hug
e building in Katowice, and he
 was always deriding me  and 
trying to poke fun at me  because of that relati
onship.  I was really a rebel at heart because I 
wouldn't take any pressure from anybody, neither
 from the Polish kids... and I was involved in 
quite a few fights in school, but eventually they
 started respecting me  and I got along very well 
with them.  Although the teachers didn't like me a
nd didn't like the idea that there was a Jewis 
boy who fended for hims elf.  I reme mber at the end 
of the year they called my mother in and told 
her that unless she ma kes sure that I go to anot
her high school, they would not pass me to the 
next grade and I'd be for ced to repeat that
 same  grade in that 
high school in Katowice.
 
 
202 Why do you think that they did that?
 
 
Because of the fact that I was Jewish
, and they were going to cause trouble.
 
 
Tell me  a little about the fact th
at you me ntioned that you're ba
sically taller and stronger... and 
the business about your father letting you be an apprentice...
 
 
Before I go to that I just want to
 me ntion that as a result of th
e pressure being put on my mother 
to take me  out of that high school, I ended 
up commuting to the high school in Sosnowiecz, 
where my uncle was the director of the high scho
ol.  I did very well in that high school.  My 
grades were good and the only pr
oblem was that I had to commute by train to Sosnowiecz and 
back, which of course took quite a bit more time.
 
 

214 During the summer my father always ma de
 arrangements for us to go on a vacation 
some where in the Southern part of Poland in 
the mountains, and until I 
was about 14 or  13 I did 
that and I had a lot of fun... you know being on vacat
ion and doing things in the countryside or in 
the mountains that you couldn't do in the city... this
 obviously appealed to me
.  But when I got to 
be about 14 or 15, it didn't  appeal 
to me  any more, and I talked my 
father into letting me  work at 
a garage in Katowice, because I was always in
terested in mechanics.  And he made an 
arrangement for me to work as an apprentice. 
 And my father had to pay the German owner 
money for me  to be an apprentice. I enjoyed it ve
ry much and didn't mi ss my
 vacations at all.  I 
felt that I was doing something that
 I really liked.  I learned how 
to drive a car at a very early 
age, and I wa s very proud of myself
 when I was 15 and could drive a car.
 
 
So you grew up essentially in Katowice.  What was it like there?
 
 
233  We lived in the city in a nice apartment 
house that had three bedrooms.  It was a stone 
building in an area of the town that wa
s considered upper class, so to speak.
 
 
Wasn't  that Jordana st reet?
 
 
Yes, the street's na me  was Jord
ana, I believe the number was 17.
 
 
Under what circumstances did you leave that location?
 
 
Before the war started, while my father was ma
king arrangeme nts to go to Israel, he sold his 
wholesale store and we moved to Krakow.  My mo
ther and I already lived in Krakow while my 
fa ther was still active in Katowice trying to wind
 up his business deals.  We packed all our 
belongings to be shipped to 
Israel.  When the war broke 
out on Sept. 1, 1939, most of our 
belonging we re already at the ra
ilroad station at Ka towice, on 
their way to being shipped to 
Israel .
 
 
Why did you move from Katowice to Krakow?
 
 
I really do not know, except that it was supposed to
 be a very short-term move.  Whe n the war 
started we were obviously caught in Krakow.
 
 

What was it like in Krakow
?   So you lived there but
 didn't really know anybody?
 
 
I didn't know Krakow at all, because I lived th
ere very shortly.  Although, as a kid a roamed 
around and thought it was a very inte
resting city, from a lot of pe
rspectives, and for a boy of 16, 
with all the castles and the history and the ston
e walls and everything else
, I thought it was very 
interesting.  I didn't have any frie
nds in Krakow because of the ve
ry short time I spent there.  I 
never started school or anything 
else in Krakow, because we we
re ready to move, and the war 
broke out in September before th
e school year started.  When the Germans moved in... we lived 
in a fairly well to do section of Krakow.  About
 2 or 3 months later, 
they took over the whole 
neighborhood for the military, or military families' 
personnel and forced us out of our apartment.  
As a result of that, my father found a place fo
r us in Wi eliczka, which was known all across 
Poland as the salt mi ne town of Pola nd.  And 
we  found an apartment in Wi eliczka, which was 
just about 300 feet from the entrance to the sa lt 
mi nes.  That's where I spent the first year and a 
half of the war.
 
 
282  At that stage we were forced to do forced-l
abor for the Germans in ma ny ways, and in order 
to keep out of the German control, so to speak, 
I joined a group of people that commuted to work 
near Krakow.  It was a project whereby the Ge
rmans were building railroads to bypass Krakow 
itself, and the spur bypassed Krakow heading towa rds the Ea stern front, towards the Russian 
border.  I was taking the train 
to a place called Krakowianka (sp?) right on the outskirts of 
Krakow.  It was forced-labor, but I di d it volunt
arily, because some how the arrangeme nt was, as 
long as you worked for a German company or for 
a German project, the Germans left you alone.  
My father and mother lived in Wi eliczka, they 
had nothing to do, no work or
 anything else.  And 
the way we survived, or tried to survive was 
by selling off gradually everything we had to get 

cheese and butter or bread and anyt
hing else like that.  Of course
, whatever we owned was very 
little and things were really getting pr etty tight
.  At one point, the Germans decided that they 
don't need any more Jews in Wi eliczka, or they
 don't want any more Jews in Wi eliczka, and 
surrounded the town, and they were going to evacua
te all the Jewish popula
tion in Wi eliczka.  
Because of my work that I commuted to, and 
because I got along very well with one of the 
German foreme n, I asked a Polish woma n to go to him and to tell him that the town was 

surrounded, and would he please try to get me  out of th
at town.  As a result of that he sent a truck 
to Wi eliczka and I managed to get my mother, 
my father, and myself and about 30 other people 
on that truck, and we drove out from Wi eliczka,
 and we ended up on the working project itself.  
Some how we ma de our home  in a brick factory, 
or a kiln... I reme mber we spent the first few 
weeks practically in that kil
n, all on our own.  There was no 
question about running away or 
doing anything else, because it was almost i mpossible, because  of the attitude of the Polish 
population, that we would get any support at
 all even if we tried to run away.
 
 
328 In order to keep the Jews working on that 
spur project, the Germ
ans started errecting 
barracks.  And as a result, my 
mother my father and myself ev
entually moved to one of the 

barracks, and were working for the Germans in diffe
rent capacities.  I, because of my mechanical 
backround, got a job driving a narr
ow gage locomotive with wagons 
that was bringing up dirt to 
build up the railroad spur.  I don't remember wh
at my mother or father were doing, but I know 
they were also doing physical work.  At one poi
nt in that I understand 
I got very sick, and I 
believe it was Dyptheria.  My arm wa s very very
 swollen, and I had drains in my ar m, a lthough 
there was no me dical care of any kind to speak of
.  Some how, I had drains in my ar m,  and I was 
delirious for quite a few weeks before I started re
cuperating.  I was very lucky in the sense that I 
grew up with both Polish and German, and... I s
eemed to be liked by some of the German 
fore me n, which ma de life a hell of a lot easier, and I 
attribut e that to the fact
 that  despite the fact 
that I was sick, somehow I survived that or deal. 
 For a period of time myself, there was a small 
quarters on the location of the job, and I had the 
priviledge of sleeping 
over at those quarters 
with my father and mother.  Unfortunately, and 
there were like another 40 people doing the same  
thing, which means we did not have to go back to
 camp every night and go back in the morning 
to the job... However, there was an accident, a
nd the barn where the lo
comotives were stored 
caught fire... everybody started running and doing wh
atever they could.  And I jumpe d into one 
of the diesel locomotives and got it out of the ba
rn before it burned down, but as a result of that 
in the morning, a contingent of SS me n ca me , a nd they decided that it wa sn't  an accident, that it 

was sabotage.  They lined up everybody and they 
started pulling people out
 to be killed.  I 
reme mber that when the SS ma n got to me , that the German forema n intervened and said, leave 
him alone, that's one of my best men... and that
's  really why I think... one of the few things 
during the war, that resulted in me  surviving th
at war.  Because there were a lot of incidents 
during the war, that for all practical
 reasons, I should have been dead.
 
 
Where exactly was this?
 
 
That was in Krakowianka, on the job.  They lock
ed about 10 or 12 of us survivors in a shed 
overnight, and of course before they locked us
 up, we watched the SS shoot all the people that 
they pulled up of the line up.  And we were convin
ced that come  morning, we'd be s hot just as 
well.  In the morning, they ma de us load the bodi
es into the Lories that
 were used on the narrow 
railroad spur and bring them out to a location wher e they were going to bring in fill.  And we 

dumped those bodies in that location, and I can st
ill reme mbe r  that there must have been at least 
one person who was still alive, b
ecause his hand, was being raised 
out of the sand... but of course 
there was nothing that anybody could have done, 
and we had to go back to the original 
workplace.  I am sure that those bodies are 
st ill there, and nobody will ever know who those 
people were, or what those people we re.  The onl
y incident I vividly reme mber, is that there 
happened to be a couple of young child
ren in that work camp t hat st
ayed overningt with me , with 
their parent s.  And because the ki ds were rela
tive ly young, 8 or 10 years old, they di dn't  have 
anything to do... so the rode with me  in the loco
motive that I was driving... and during the line 
up, the SS pulled those two children and the father
 and the mother went absolutely crazy, and 
they were told by the SS ma n that if they don't 
keep quiet he'll shoot them too... and of course 

they didn't, and as a result the mother the father 
and the two children were 
shot right in front of 
me .
 
 
What happened next?
 
 
Next, after the fire, of course there wa s nobody 
who could stay on the job or on the premisis 
exept by comi ng in the morining and going back at 
night, to the barracks, the barracks base.  
 
 
425  Life went on from day to day, hoping that 
the Germans would start 
losing eventually and 
ma ybe that would be the end of our mi sery there,  but unfortunatelly, it la
sted and went on and on 
and on... Across the road going from Krakow to 
Wi eliczka, there was another camp called 
Jerozolims ka, and in that camp there was another 
large group of Jews.  Jerozolimska used to be a 
Jewish cemetary, and the function of those Jews 
living on the other side of the highway in the 
camp called Jerozolimska, was to dig up the corpse
s and retrieve the gold
, whether it was teeth 
or rings or any kind of jewelery from the corpses 
that were buried there already for a long time.  
That was the only thing I reme mber abtout Jerozo
limska.  I have never been there, but you could 
see it from our camp because it was on a hill going up and you could observe it some times, as far 
as the activity that was going on there.
 
 
448  After building the spur around Krakow, we, 
as a group of people forced to work were 
moved to Skarzysko-Kami enne.  It was a place 
where the Germans took over a munitions factor y 
and they were adding to the capacity of the m
unit i ons factory.  When they unloaded us at 
Skarzysko-Kami enne, there were three camps al
ready in existence: camp A, ca mp B a nd camp 
C.  Ca mp C was considered, after a short time  
aft e r they unloaded us
 from the train... we 
understood that camp C was the worst camp of a ll th
e three of them.  It was the worst because 
that was the facility where the ar tilery shells 
were being filled with 
the powder, and it was a 
yellow powder and somehow the people must have
 absorbed the powder through their skin... and 
at the beginning it was really weir
d because their color was yellow. 
 Of course, it was a chemical 
reaction that ma de those people 
look yellow, and I understood that
 their life span was shortened 
very much... so when they lined us up, after they
 unloaded us from the tr
ain they started sorting 
us out.  And they started asking for people w
ho are electricians, people who are mechanics, 
different professions.  The mi nute I heard some bodyaskinf for an electrician or a me chanic, I 

raised my hand and I was selected to be moved 
to the other camp.  I didn't know which one, A or 
B, but it ended up being, I believe, A.  My fath
er and mother, unfortunate
ly got stuck in camp C, 
and while we were being led out by a German gu ard from ca mp C on the way to camp A, which 
was only a couple of mi l e s away, the comment by 
the German guard was "Well, you got yourself 
another extention of your 
life be leaving Camp C."
 
 

497  I arrived at camp A and we were put into 
barracks.  Our job was to help building a new 
facility where munitions are going to
 be produced.  I lost 
track of my father and mother, with the 
exception that once a month, there was a delousing 
facility at our camp, and different groups of 
people were comi ng in to be deloused.  So once a 
month or so my father or my mother came  to 
our camp to be deloused, and because I knew when they were comi ng, I always ma de sure that I 
had the opportunity to see them.  This experience 
kind of splits into two, because of the fact that 
there wasn't  enough food to satisfy the people's hunge
r, and because of the fact that we had a 
number of Polish employees working at the fact
ory also... that was alre
ady producing artilery 
shells, just the casings... I felt that it was 
a good opportunity to put in ma ybe a few extra hours 
for the Pole, and as a result, he'd give me  bread or
 anything else to eat.  A
ll of that worked fine 
until I realized that with a
ll the additional food and worki
ng all those additional hours, 
physically, I wasn't  gaining anything... as a ma tter 
of fact, I was getting 
weaker.  And I came to 
the conclusion that that idea wasn't  
such a bright idea.  So I gave up the idea of trying to work an 
evening shift, besides working myself duri
ng the day.  My job during the day was hooking up 
different ceme nt machi nes to the electric wire
s.  I don't know how or why, but I became  very 
proficient at it, and as a result 
in the later stages I was getti
ng extra food so there was no reason 
for me  to work for a Pole or anything else to 
get extra food.  The second 
part of it was that my 
mother and father were obviously stuck in camp 
C and suddenly I realized that the people that I 
was friendly with kind of... you know didn't communicat
e with me  as they used to before.  And 
before long I realized that some
thing happened, and I found out that
 my mother got hurt because 
one of the people working in Camp C dropped a load
ed artilery shell, and the shell exploded and 
quite a number of people got injured, among the m, 
my mother.  Because there was absolutely no 
me dical care at all, although he injuries today wo
uld have not been considered very serious, or 
she would have had a very good chance of survival
... Because of no me dical care or attention she 
was having a very hard time , and my  father, in orde
r to be as helpful or 
to do whatever he could 
for my mother, went to the extr
eme of having his gold teeth extrac
ted so he could sell the gold 
and buy my mother the proper nurishment.  All 
of that did no good, and eventually, my mother 
died.
 
 
Where?
 
 
Skarzysko-Ka mi enne.  I know my mother died 
at Skarzysko-Kami enne.  I know she was buried 
in a ma ss grave.  I really have no idea where 
or what or how, but I guess she's one of the 6 
million Jews that vani shed and that died duri
ng the war and nobody will ever now where she is.  
I'm glad that I know as much as I know about it, because my father survived, and it's from hi m 
that I learned all the details about what 
my mother went through before she died.
 
 
588 I don't reme mber precisely how long I stayed 
in that camp, but eventually the Russians 
started advancing and the Germans got really worr
ied about it.  So they shipped all of us out, 
which was quite a number of people, to the East
ern part of Poland--I know it was early fall or 

late summer --to dig ditches in th
e form of a "V"... they were qu
ite big, to prevent the Russian 
tanks from c o mi ng across.  We were living very
 pr imitively, and we had relatively ve ry poor 
shelter for the climate, and it was lucky that it 
was late summer  or ealy 
fall, otherwise it would 
have been horrible.  They were happy having the 
kind of tank traps that we  built.  They moved 
us from there to Czestochowa.  They also had a 
munitions factory in Czes
tochowa, and they also 
had two camps.  And I ended up in one facility and 
my father ended up in the second facility.  By 
comparison to Skarzysko, Czestochowa wasn't  that ba
d at all.  I was active, I joined a group that 
was rebuilding the engines for the German Tiger tanks...
 
 
[END OF SI DE A, TAPE 1]
 
... back from the Eastern front that broke down or
 needed rebuilding.  A
nd I was assigned to a 
group of Germans that was assigned to testing th e engines after they were being rebuilt.  The 
system was that the whole engine was taken ap
art, and every part was measured, and only the 
good parts were going to go to the ne w engine... or 
replaced by new parts.  The rest wa s thrown 
out.  Because  I was working with some  Ger man sold
iers, they were kind of taking care of me .  I 
got along with them very well, and they were br
inging me  sandwiches, and 
I even enjoyed what I 
was doing, so as a result of that, I had absolutely
 no complaints about that period of time ... and 
contrary to a lot of other people I looked like 
a very well nourished me mb er of the camp.  My 
father happened to be in an ajoining camp also in
 Czestochowa, working also in some  kind of a 
munitions factory.  Occasionaly, he had a chan
ce to come over to the 
camp where I was living, 
and we had a chance to see each ot he r.  He seem
ed to be dealing pretty we ll with the overall 
situation at that time .  Some ti me  at the e
nd of '44 and beginning of '45, the Russians were 
advancing from the East.  And in January of '45, t h
ey were getting pretty close to our area, and 
the Germans decided to evacuate us.  One day they
 just ma de everybody walk out to the railroad 
spur and loaded us on the freight wagons, and we started moving We st.  They emptied 
completely the camp in Czestochowa.  While we
 were travelling through the night, towards the 
West fr om Czestochowa it was al most ironic th
at at one point we were passing the town of 
Katowice, where I was born... of course that brou
ght up an awful lot of emotions that I went 
through in that period.  We ended up in Buchen
wald after a few days, and Buchenwald was a 
huge concentration camp that was in existence al
ready, from what I understand, from before the 
beginning of the second WW.  There were rows and 
rows of barracks, and we were ma rched into 
the camp and were allocated into
 a wooden structure of a barrac
k.  We  lived on straw ma tresses 
and two me a l s in the day -- in the morning and in 
the evening.  And we real
ized that the war isn't 
going to last too long, so everybody's hope was that
 the Germans will ge t conquered and that we 

will be liberated.
 
 
037  What did you eat?
 
 
Well, we had mostly... soup and a quarter of a Eu
ropean type bread, a German type of military 
bread.  However, fortunatelly, during that period, 
either the Americans or the British had bombed 

Wei mar, which was a city not too far from Buche n
wald, and had done an awful lot of dama ge in 
the residential areas, so the German
s took us out to the town of We
i mar in order to help clean up 
the dama ge that was caused by the bombardment. 
 We  were also... we were going to Wei mar by 
train and comi ng back to the camp by train, but be
ing outside of the camp gave us an opportunity 
to get some  extra food that traditionally the Germ
ans were storing in the cellars, like potatoes 
and jams, and ma ybe a piece of bacon, which obviously helped everybody to get more 
nourishment than they we re getting in the camp.  My father also ended up in Buchenwald in an 

adjoining barracks, which was separated from 
our s by a fence, and because I was getting enough 
food during the day while I was working in cleani
ng up the destruction, I wa
s able to give him 
some of the food that was allocated to me in th
e evening when I came  back from work.  Because 
not everybody was able to go to work in the city to
 try to clean it up.  Ther
e were a lot of inmates 
in Buchenwald that did not have a chance to get 
extra food and I was aware 
that a lot of times the 
stronger inma tes were trying to take away the food from the weaker ones... and it was like a 

death sent ence because the weaker ones could not defend themselves or could not have  enough 
food in order to survive.  I defi
nitely was a witness to the fact 
that every day there were a number 
or corpses that were taken out 
of the area of people that did 
not have enough strength or who 
could not survive under those circumstances.  
 
 
065  The Russians still kept advancing and at one
 point, the Germans deci
ded to evacuate all the 
Jews from Buchenwald.  At that point I d
ecided that being a Jew would probably more 
dangerous than not being a Jew.  As a result, I 
ma naged to take and armband that belonged to a 
Frenchma n who happened to be in Buchenwald w ho was dead, and I took his armband and put it 
on my arm a nd I got rid of my ar mba nd which desi
gnated me  as a Jew.  And I tried to blend in 
with the rest of the different 
nationalities that were  left  in Buchenwald after the Je ws were 
evacuated.  Two or three days 
after the Jews were evacuated 
from Buchenwald, the Germans 
decided to evacuate the whole camp again.  They lo
aded us on freight cars and they happened to 
be open freight cars.  And on every freight car, 
on top, was sitting on each end a German soldier, 

and I'm stressing this particul ar point because 
three or four days out of Buchenwald, going 
towards the Czech border, we were attacked by 
British airplane s on a huge railroad spur , and... 
the train contained like four or five thous
and people from the Buchenwald camp, and I 
understood later that apparently the British pilots
, seeing those soldiers sitting on top of those 
freight cars, thought that 
that was a convoy of Ge rman soldiers, and they strafed us with ma chine 

guns and small bombs that also disrupte
d the railroad system at that point.
 
 
089  A lot of the people that were in those trains go
t killed as a result of 
that incident.  And after 
everything quieted down, we were forced to put th
e bodies of all the people
 that got killed into 
the last three or four railroad 
cars, and there was really a.. ju
st bodies, piled one on top of the 
other, and the rest of us got into
 the rest of the railro
ad cars and we continued on our trip towards 
another camp in Czechoslovakia, I'm sure... I don'
t re me mb er the name of that camp, but it was 
on the German-Bavarian border, and we were there 
for a few weeks, and then again just before 
the end of the war, which was th
e end of April, the Germans d
ecided to march us out towards 

Dachau.  We ma rched during the night and we rest
ed during the day, hidden in the woods so we 
would not be spotted by any airpla
nes.  It was Spring and the rain
 was pouring.  It was very cold, 
and a lot of people could not keep 
up with it, and every so often, I 
heard shots in the back [of the 
line? ] and the Germans were killing the people th
at could not keep up or fell down and could not 
walk any more.  I was determined to do the best to
 survive, and I always as a result of that tried 
to stay up front of the column.  The c olumn wa
s a long column of the prisoners from t he camp 
on the Czech border.
 
 
How old we re you?
 
 
At that time I was 22 years old, and 
I could feel that the 
end of the war was near.  My father who 
was in Buchenwald, and they had no choice or di
dn't think of a better 
solution, was evacuated 
with the Jewish group a fe w days before myself and the rest of the camp of Buchenwald was 
emptied out.  On one of those nights on the ma rc
h toward Buchenwald [sic? ] we were supposed 
to rest during the day, but the Germans apparent
ly knew that they were being advanced on, so 
they got us out of the woods and put us on th
e road to ma rch towards Dachau during the day, 
which was totally out of style for the last few days.  We  were 
ma rching for about an hour and a 
half or two hours, and suddenly I realized that
 there was some  kind of a  commotion on the back 
of the column and I saw that the column was ki
nd of splitting, and a tank 
appeared on the right, 
and it had a white star on it.  In the beginni
ng I thought it must be the Russians, but then I 
realized it wa s an American tank.  And then th
e second, third, and so on... the guards that were 
walking along side on both sides of us starte
d taking off for the woods
 and the tanks were 
shooting at them, and you could s
ee the tracer bullets tryi ng to ge
t them before they ma naged to 
disappear into the woods.
 
 
135 At that point of course ever
ybody realized that this was the 
mo ment that we'd waited for for 
years.  And although there was not a spontaneous
 rejoicing because ever
ybody was really very 
weak... we were not fed during that ma rch, excep
t a cup full of grain... 
otherwise there was no 
bread and no drink except water.  When that fi
nally happened, the only th
ing I can recall now is 
that a lot of the Russians and people that were 
really in good physical form, took off aft e r the 
Germans and immediately the revenge for all that 
suffering and all those years of mi s e ry came to 
the surface.  The first and second tank were s
hooting at the Germans, and the third tank was 
taking pictures of what was happening.  The rest 
of the tanks were throwing out army rations, or 
camp rations, or sea?  rations, which were packag
es of food which were very well preserved and 
could last a very long time .  
Obviously everybody pounced on the rations that were being thrown 
out by the American crew of the tanks, because
 everybody was really star
ving at that point.  
And... people were just sitting on the sides on th
e ditches and most of them were totally 
exhausted, a lot of them were crying, and of course
... if you had the appetite to eat at that stage of 
the game , you started opening up the package and ea
ting some  of the food th
at was contained in 
those packages.  It was like little cans of sc
rambl e d eggs, little cans of SPAM, some  crackers, 

and I reme mber there was a package of four cigarette
s as part of that whole package.  I tried to 
light up one cigarette and I almo
st fainted because I hadn't smoked for a few years, and those 
cigarettes were very strong a
nd they almost knocked me  out.
 
 
165 It was mi dday by the time everybody realizedthat we we re free and we started looking 
around as to what to do with ourse
lves the first day of being free.  We  were not too far from a 
small village so a number of guys and myself a
nd a couple of other people who were kind of 
hanging on to me  for survival during the last coup
le of weeks, we decided to occupy a German 
far mhouse.  And we, the Germans disappeared, 
there was nobody in the house.  It was a 
far mhouse with animals, pigs, chickens and stuff 
like that.  So we organized ourselves and we 
decided that's where we were going to stay over ni
ght and decide what we  were going to do after 
that.  A few of the Polish people that joined us 
used to be cooks at the camp.  They said, don't 
worry, tomo rrow we are going to eat sausages.  A
nd they caught a pig and all I know is the next 
day we were having sausages from the pig that they ma naged to kill overnight, and it seemed like 
we were going to have a feast.  And one of the ma
in things that I reme mbe r  is that they took a 
frying pan through and a piece of lard or fat from 
the pig into the frying pan, and when it got hot, 
they started putting eggs into it, and the eggs 
of course were boiling in that fat, and everybody 
thought it was wonderful, including 
myself, and I... of course those eggs were really fa t... 
because they were practically fried(?).  I don'
t know how many I had but I had a few of those 
eggs for breakfast and as a result of
 that I had the worst diarreah in 
my life that last ed for fi ve or 
six days because my stomach was not us
ed to that kind of
 food at the time.
 
 
194 We  stayed at the farmhouse for about five or
 six days and tried to recoup some  of our 
strength.  It was very nice to have finally a roof over your head 
and be free to do whatever we 
wanted to do.  And then the decision cameas to where we would go from here, because 
obviously, we were not going to stay at the farmhous
e forever.  We  started on a trek to a small 
town in Bavaria called Sc hwandorf.  And in Sc
hwandorf, because a lot of the Germa ns were 

either absent or ran away or whatever it was, we found also an empty hous e on the outskirts of 

that town and we kind of organized ourselves an
d tried to shed our concentration camp clothing 
by trying to find whatever we c
ould find that would not identify
 us as concentration camp 
inmates.  We basically tried to join the 
civilian life, and tried to norma lize our life...
 
 
213 In that town in Schwandorf, the military pol
ice establishe d a headquarters and because I 
started English in high school in Poland, I kind of
 struck up a conversation with some  of the 
MP's and also a unit of the counter-intelligence corps, had a headquart
ers in that city of 
Schwandorf.  I eventually joined the CIC, becau
se I spoke German, Polish and English, and they 
incorporated me  into their group, gave me  an
 ar my uniform, a  PX card, and all kinds of 
identification that I was part of
 that group.  The function of this
 unit was to try to find the 
Germans that were active in Poland during the wa
r and were in charge of the concentration 

camps, were in charge of the forced labor camps
, and particularly the ones that were really 

abusing their power via the prisoners, the people 
in the camps... because a lot of the construction 
companies that were working in Poland originated
 in Bavaria, we ended up going to the offices 
of the different companies and found the name s and 
addresses of the particular people that were 
really taki ng advantage of the power that they
 had during the war in terms  of persecuting and 
killing some  of the prisoners.  As a result of th
at  activity a number of th
em were found and were 
returned to Poland for trial and I understood that
 quite a number of them were found guilty and 
were given the death sentence and we re
 executed in Poland during 1946 and 1947.
 
 
244 During my activity in Schwandorf, my father 
ma naged to realize that
 I was alive and in 
Schwandorf, and at the same  ti me  I also realized 
that he survived the war.  A lot of lists were 
published all over Germany of the names of the su
rvivors, and this is how I found him and he 
found me  on one of the lists.  
WE were reunited about two or three months after the end of the 
war and needless to say it was a very very joyous
 occasion.  The only sad part of that whole 
period was that my mother did no
t survive the war.  My sist er, which spent her time  in Israel  
during that period, obviously did no
t suffer as a result of the war,
 except she was mentally very 
distressed because she di d not hear of her parents or her brot he r, being me , and she suffered 

terribly because of what she 
knew the people in Europe were 
suffering while she was living in 
Palestine during those years.
 
 
After working with the CIC for close to a 
year , I was employed by the UN Rehabilitation 
Organization, which was very active in Germany. 
 I moved to Regensburg and the unit that I was 
active in the UN Rehab. Org. was part of the Unit
ed Joint Appeal.  And 
I was very active in 
Jewish cause s, going from displaced persons cam
p to DP camp.  I worked originally with a 
fellow from the states by the name  of Joe Levi
ne, who lives now in Fort Wayne, Indiana and is 
also very active getting all the f
acts during the war together.  He's  
active in the Jewish historical  
society in Fort Wa yne, Indiana.  Eventually, to
wa rds the end of 1947, my 
father emmi grated to 
Israel through an underground orga
nization, and I followed, myself, at
 the end of 1948 to Israel.  
I lived in Israel for five years before I came to th
e states.  As far as I know, before the war, there 
were about 40 me mbers of our immediate family
 -- uncles, aunts, cousins -- and the only ones 
that I am aware that 
survived was Max Bolimow
s ky, my uncle on my mother's side, and Fevek 
Wi wer man, whom I me ntioned before who 
was my father's brother in law.  
 
 
296 To fill in some  of the details, I be longed to 
the Ha'Noar organizaton in Poland when I was a 
young kid, and that organization was active in all kinds
 of Zionist activities, including collections 
of money to buy land from the Arabs in Pales
tine at that time .  There was also another 
organization called Beitar, to which I did not 
belong.  During my growing up in Katowice and 
the time  that I attended the Cheder, I spoke Polish, German, I  took English in High School, and I 

also spoke Yiddish, and of course I 
learned to read and write Hebrew.
 
 

You didn't me ntion mu ch a
bout your hobbies growing up...
 
 
My hobbies growing up were a lot of different 
types of sports, includ
ing ice skating, skiing, 
bicyling, and one of the other activities wa
s boxing, which I ended up with a broken nose.
 
 
You wanted to me ntion some thing about the UJA... shipping packages...
 
 
After the war I joined the United Jewish A
ppeal organization and I was working with a 
representative from the United States, Joe Levine and Abe Cohen from Detroit who took Joe 
Levine's place eventually, we used to receive an
 enormous a mount of packages from the Jews in 
America.  The packages included all kinds of cl
othing which was definite
ly needed because the 
people who were liberated from ca mps had absolutely
 nothing that belonged to them in terms of 
clothing or any other posessions. 
 
 
 
The other thing... the connection of th
e musical talent of your fa mily...
 
 
The musical talent  in my family originated with
 my mother who was also a pianist, and because 
of her my sister was attending th
e conservatory, learning the Pia
no in Poland and that's  why she 
ended up in Israel to finish her studies in the 
conservatory of Tel Avi
v.  As a result of her 
background, her son now, whose name  is Ra mi  
Barniv, is a fa mous pianist who travels around 
the world giving concerts in classical music.
 
 
This is all that I have to say for now about my
 early life, and the year
s during the war.  Even 
though it sounds very cut and dry, du
ring narration, I must admit it 
is a very unnerving emotional 
experience to recount those days in detail.  I hop
e this tape will be of good use to the Holocaust 
Museum.  Thank you.
