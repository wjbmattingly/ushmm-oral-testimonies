LILLYAN ROSENBERG 
 August 31, 2006 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust  Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan 
Rosenberg, conducted by Amy Rubi n on August 31
st
, 2006. This interview is ma de possible by a 
grant from Carole and Maurice Berk. This is ta
pe number one, side A. Mrs. Rosenberg, could 
you please begin by telling me  your full name  as 
it is today, and also wh
at was your name  at 
birth? 

Answer: My name  is Lillyan Rosenberg, and I 
wa s born Lilly Cohn in Halberstadt, Germany. I 
now live in New York in Beechhurst, Queens. 

Q: When we re you born? 

A: January 30
th
, 1928. 
Q: And tell me a little bit about your fa mily. 
A: My fa mily lived in Halberstadt for ma ny, ma ny
 years. In fact, my grandfather was already 
born in Halberstadt. So we have
 a history of about 300 years and I have some  very old papers 
that go back to my grandparents 
living in Germany and they lived 
in Halberstadt all these years. 
And my co -- fa mily was very comfortable, a
nd had a very cultured, lovely life in my early 
childhood. 
Q: Who was  in your imme diate fa mily? 

A: My immediate fa mily in New York? 

Q: No, in -- in Halberstadt, when you were a child. 

A: When I was a child, I had one brother. My
 brother™s name was Vanna, Vanna Cohn, and he 
was born in 1923, and I was born in 1928, so my  parent
s just had two children. My father™s name  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510

was Ernst Cohn, my mot her™s name  -- ma iden na
me  was Margaret -- Mar
guerita Marcuza, later 
on Marguerita Cohn. And my grandfather™s name , 
who was also in Halber
stadt, was Hugo Cohn. 
He was ma rried to Zelma  Lusch. 

Q: Tell me a little bit about the personalities of your parent s. 

A: My father had a linen factory, and we had a 
very good sized store in 
the same  building where 
we lived. The store was downstair
s and had ma ny employees. The articles that were sold were 
mostly very elegant linens. In fact, when my pa
rents sent me  to England as a little girl, my 

suitcase has many linens fr om my parent™s home, and I™m still using them today. 

Q: And wha t  about his personal
ity? Can you describe him to me ?  
A: My father was a very jovial
 person. He was a happy person. I reme mb er ma ny parties at our 
house and my parents were good dancers. And the 
parties which my parents gave is some thing 
that always rema ined with me , because it was a 
very comfortable, lovely home in my early 
childhood. 
Q: And your mother, your 
mother™s personality? 
A: I think I™m a lot like my mother. My mother
 was born Marguerita Ma
rcuza in Stargard, and 
the area was called Pommern. Stargard in Pommern is now Polish. My mother was a very 
hospitable person, and as I reme mber, there were ma
ny cultured type of affairs such as music at 
home . There was always piano pl
aying and entertaining, 
and these were the early me mories that 
I have.  

Q: What about me mories of your fa mily at hom
e?  What are some of the earliest me mories you 
have of your fa mily all together? 

A: We ll, the synagogue played 
an important part. Every Frid
ay night the me n would go to 
synagogue. I think my mother was home  on Friday
 night, and then there wa s the usual Shabbas 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
3 
 
 
dinner. And I do have a picture 
of the dining room table on a re
gular Shabbat evening, with the 
candles, and the challah, the kidd
ish cup, and my grandfather, w
ho lived upstairs, would always 
be at our house every Friday ev
ening. This would be routine, a
nd then on a Shabbat morning, we 
always went to synagogue. The synagogue play
ed a big role in my childhood. The me n and 
wome n wer e  seated separately. The me n were dow
nstairs and the wome n were upstairs like in a 
gallery. The children were with the wo me n and we
 would look through this little fence-type 
thing and go downs -- look downstairs at th
e me n. And I would look forward to the one 
particular time that the children were allowed 
downstairs in the ma in synagogue, and that was 
Simc has Torah, when they had s-sweets and ca
ndies for the children. And I even reme mber 
playing a prank here or  there in the synagogue by putting some  bread -- breadcrumbs or cookies 

into some  men™s jackets. My fr
iend Ruth Oppenheimer, her name  then was Ruth Lindheimer, but 
she also lives in New York, and we are still ve
ry, very good friends, I talk to her daily, well she 
and I played this prank and we 
put these cookies, or crumbs in
to me n™s suits and pockets. And 
eventually we had to go and own 
up to it and apologize. We  did. 
Q: Do you reme mber the name  of the synagogue? 

A: I only reme mber my [indeciphe
rable]. I don™t know if 
it had a particular name . The r e was one 
-- this was the ma in synagogue, and then there 
wa s another little synagog
ue called Klaus, and 
that was for those who were super, super Ort
hodox. And there were quite a few Jewish fa mily 
who were very, very Orthodox. And in the buildi
ng which used to be the Klaus synagogue is 
where they are now having the new little museum 
to comme morate and try to show what Jewish 
life was like before Hitler. 

Q: And wha t  about your fa mily, would you cons
ider your family Orthodox?  Your family in 
Halberstadt? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
4 
 
 
A: No, my family in Halberstadt was not cons
idered very Orthodox, although we had separate 
dishes for milk and meat, and by American standa
rds, I would con -- probably say it would have 
been Orthodox. But by the standards of Halberstad
t, it was not considered to be so, because 
people were either extremely Orthodox -- and I 
reme mber my mother saying [indecipherable] 
kosher, which means we are new kosher, and 
that meant we™re not so terribly strict. 
Q: So, can you describe to me  a little 
more about the town of Halberstadt? 
A: It was a very charmi ng town of mostly half
-timbered houses. Half-timbered me a ns it™s sort of 
cement and wood together, with a great deal of de
tail of wood. And I remember some  of the old 
buildings, one having a statue on th
e outside, and that is the town
 hall. This statue was called 
Bucco, and we learned a little poem as childr
en, which says Bucco von Halberstadt [speaks 
German here]. And it means, Bucco from Halber
stadt, what will you give  our children?  Will you 
give them a new pair of shoes?  Yes, that™s 
what your children shoul
d have. And I remember 
some of these children™s songs and some of thes
e children™s poems, because I was 10 and a half 
years old when I left Halberstadt. 
Q: And how large of a Jewish commun
ity in Halberstadt, would you say? 
A: I really don™t know, but there were hundreds of fa milies, but I do not know the exact number. 

I am sure that that could be found at the me
w -- new museum, which is now called the Moses 
Mendelssohn Academy. They would have
 all the exact figures and details. 
Q: What was your sense of things, was it a -- a fa
irly large Jewish community for the size of the 
town?  

A: Yes, I believe it was. As a 
matter of fact, Halberstadt was well renowned in the Jewish circles, 
because of ha ving a large community and a ve
ry active synagogue, and a very active Jewish 
community life. I have noticed that in some  of thos
e old papers that I have, and the ones that date 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
5 
 
 
back about 300 years, they were written in He
brew, so we had some  of those translated. And 
they -- it said for instance, that many businesse
s were conducted while in
 s -- during or after 
synagogue when people -- it was a meeting place, 
so it was a very active Jewish community. 
Q: And wha t  about your fa mily?  Do you reme mb er
 if it was mostly Jewish friends that your 
fa mily had, or also non-Jewish friends in the town? 
A: I do think that my -- the majority of my pare
nt™s friends we re Jewish. Also, the children I 
went to school with, since I wa
s at the Jewish school, they we
re all Jewish, and the parents 
would be fren -- friend
lyfor ma ny, many years. 
Q: And can you describe to me  a little more 
in terms of a physical description, your home? 
A: Our home was a rather elegant home . It was s
ituated right above these stores, which were at 
ground level. My grandfather owned the property, a
nd there were at least th
ree to four bedrooms, 
a large living room, then there was -- the livi
ng wa s qua -- w-was -- the efs -- there was [speaks 
German], which is a smoking room. So it™s 
a dining room, living room, s moking room. My 
parent™s bedroom, my brother™s bedroom, a
nd mi ne, and there was a guest bedroom. And 
everything was rather elegantly furnished. We  
had a ma id who took care of my brother and 
myself. Her name  was Alvina, and she was with 
us for ma ny, ma ny years. I have a picture even 
now of Alvi na and my brother 
and I being at the wedding and I 
was the flower girl, age about 
four or five years old, with little flowers in th
e hair. But I do have th
e picture of Alvina. She 
ma rried a man who was a carpenter, and my parent
s asked this ge -- this gentlema n to ma ke a 
copy of our kitchen, so I had a small kitchen, a re
plica of my parent™s ki
tchen, and as a child I 
played with that a gr eat deal. A
nd when I went to England my pa
r -- parents actually sent that 
children™s furniture to 
England. What happened 
to it, I don™t know. 
Q: What are your earliest me mories as a child? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
6 
 
 
A: They were happy me mories and I reme mber 
the first day of school, where my friend Ruth 
Lindheimer [indecipherable] and I 
started school together. And child
ren at school get like a big 
bag, like a huge cone out of cardboard, and that is 
filled with candy and toys and pencils. So that 
was a very happy kind of me mory. That was appr
oxima tely 1935, and I was at the Jewi sh school 
until the school was closed, and that  was after Kristallnacht - Crystal Night. 

Q: So one of your first me mories is -- is probabl
y the first day of school, and -- and tell me  more 
about school, other me mories you have of
 the early days of being in school. 
A: I guess things were still quite norma l in the 
early days. For instance, Hebrew was taught from 
the beginning on, like a foreign 
language. Later on I would learn a foreign language by 
translation. And so we translated prayers, and 
not only learned to translate word for word, but 
also how to ma ke little se ntences, so that we 
had a fairly good knowledge of Hebrew. I can still 
read Hebrew, although I must say that when I left
 Germany, I had little
 contact later on with 
Jewish people. 
Q: So you were at a religious school? 
A: Yes, the school was religious and the headma
ster™s name  was Luntner, Herr Luntner. That 
fa mily had five children in various ages from
 -- some  -- the older one was called yo -- Jota, and 
she came with me  to the train station on the day I left Germany. But school was a happy time, 

and it seeme d perfectly normal, we did the usual 
things, like gymnastics. 
I would walk to school, 
it was not very far, probably a 10 mi nute walk. 
And having been back in Germany a c ouple of 
years ago, I saw the building again. 

Q: Do you know the name  of the school? 

A: Yeah, this was the Juda [indecipherable] in 
Halberstadt. The Jewish 
school in Halberstadt. 
How ma ny c hil -- students were there, I don™t kno
w, but I do have a picture of all the students 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
7 
 
 
together, taken in Halberstadt at
 atime  when my brot
her and I were at school together, and my 
friend Ruth, and her present husba
nd Henry are also on that pictur
e. There are appr oxima tely 40 
students on that photo which I have. 
Q: Now tell me a little more about your brothe
r, hi s personality and when you were very young, 
did the two of you get along, did 
you fight?  Tell me  about him. 
A: We ll, my  brother was, as I said, five years ol
der than I, and he seemed to be very proud of 

having a little sister. He often 
told me later on as we were growing up that he said [speaks 
German here]. In other words that means I or -- 
put in an order for you. So he was very proud of 
having a little sister. Although, as I grew up, I th
ink I was sometimes a bit of a burden when my 
parents said they had to take me  along, and 
I would drag behind all these boys, who were 
teenagers by then, and they had to take along th
e younger sister. So it wasn™t always great fun for 
him, but perfectly norma l. However, my brothe
r took great responsibilit
y for me . Obviously, my 
parents must have said that he 
should keep an eye on me  always
, and he always did because the 
two of us were in England, even
 though we were not together. 
Q: And wha t  about, since you were at a Jewish
 school, I™m imagining the other students are 
Jewish, did you have any non-Jewish frie
nds in the town of Halberstadt? 
A: I can™t reme mber any discrimi nation, but I ac
tually don™t think that among my circle of 
friends that there were non-Jewi
sh friends, because they were probably children I went to school 
with, and children whose parents my  parents 
knew. So I don™t have 
any real co
llection -- 
recollection of anyone non-Jewish. 

Q: Now, when the Nazis came to power, you we
re very young. And tell me  what your very 
earliest me mories are about the begi nni
ng of the Nazis and the Hitler regi me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510

A: You know, times we re not lik
e they are today where you put
 on a television and you see 
instantly what is happening in so
me  other part of the world. And 
I think my parents shielded us 
from any extra worries, or extra concerns. Howe
ver, I do reme mber seeing signs in the windows 
that sa id, Juden [indecipherable]. That means, 
Jews are not we lcome here. And I would question 
that sort of thing by -- because I coul d r
ead by then. In 1933, Hitle
r came to power on my 
birthday, January 30
th
. Other schools had a holiday because 
Hitler was in power, it was a day off 
from school. Not in the Jewish school, we went to school. And then one day, comi ng from 
school -- and this would be closer to like 1938, 
other kids would call across the street, look at 
those Jews, look at those Jewish 
children, and the kids would thro
w stones at us. And I said -- I 
could not understand, why would they be throwi
ng stones at us, we weren™t doing anything. And 
you™d run home  as quick as possible. So thes
e are my first bad feelings on knowing that 
some thing was going on beyond our control. 

Q: We ll, you would run home  and you would proba
bly talk to your parents about this. What 
were they telling you? Do you reme mber any 
of the discussions with your parents? 
A: I was aware that there was a Nazi party, be
cause the other children, who were not Jewish, 
belonged to an organization calle
d the Hitlerjugend. The Hitler yout
h. And of course, my brother 
did not belong to the Hitler youth, who would ha
ve been ma ybe 14 or 15 at that time . But the 
Jewish youngsters ha d their own organization, the 
Maccabee or  some  other clubs that they would 
have. But the Hitler youth were very visible in Ge
rmany, and of course I was aware of that. But 
it was not a ma jor discussion in my parent™s hom
e until the night of Kristallnacht, when the 
Nazis came to our home in the mi ddle of the ni
ght, and they knocked 
at the door, and if -- 
everybody was sleeping, it was an ordinary night,
 no one expected anything unusual. And there 
were two men at the door, and they said, we 
are here to get mi s -- Mr. Cohn, Ernst Cohn, my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510

father. And he had to get dressed very quickly,and the two me n marched 
downstr -- the street. 
Our home is diagonally across from the main post 
office. The ma in post office is still there, our 
home  is not. And as we looked out, we could 
see other Jewish me n, each one with two SS me n, 
they™re -- the Nazis. And they walked them off,
 we did not know where they were going. They 
took them and put them into a prison in Halber
stadt. And a couple of hours later they knocked at 
our door again, and they said, we came  to ge
t the other Mr. Cohn. And my mother said, you 
already took him, he™s gone, he -- he left. And 
they said, there™s anothe
r one. We ll, my brother 
was hiding in a closet or some where that same
 night. And she said, the only other Herr Cohn is 
upstairs, but you would have to carry him because he 
is an invalid and he  is very ol d. They said 

no, that™s not the one, and they 
left. That way my brother was 
not taken. My father was then 
taken to Buchenwald, a concentration camp. 

Q: Can you -- can I ask you, what was this like?  
You were very young, and -- and was this very 
frightening, that night 
that this happened? 
A: We ll, I realized that things were terribly, te
rribly wrong, and it™s a -- an
 extraordinarily scary 
event for any child. I did not know the multitude
 of significance of what was happening on a 
worldwide ba sis at  the time . My fa ther was in Bu
chenwald for a little over five weeks. We  did 
find out where he was. I don™t know whether it wa
s Red Cross letters, or -- by some  way, my 
mother knew where my  father was. And he cam
e home after five weeks, a good five weeks in 
Buchenwald, and his hair was shaven from his head
 completely, he had lost a lot of weight. And 
my father, having been on the road as a sale
sman for ma ny years, said, I always brought you 
some thing home , well I brought you some thing. And 
he had dry bread in his pockets that was 
very, very hard, but he said, I brought this for 
you. It was then, when my father came home, that 
my parents decided they must do something to re
scue the lives of their children, for my brother 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
10 
 
 
and I. And they then registered me  for the -- or
 both of us for the kindertransport. My brother, 
however, was 15 at the time , and I was 10, a
nd at 15 they no longer took children on the 
kindertransport. They took them from four to 14, and he was a little too old, so he was not able to 
have guardians in England like I did. 

Q: Now, let me  ask you, before Kristallnacht, 
did you notice -- do you reme mber other things 
that were happening and changing?  Did you ask any -- you know, additional questions of your 

parents? Do you reme mb er anyt
hing else going on even befo
re all of this happened at 
Kristallnacht? 

A: We ll, they came to every Jewish ho me  and 
collect -- dema nded all silver and gold. So my 
parents had to give up the jewelry, and I believe 
they must have hidden certain things, they did 
not give up everything. But they hi
 -- picked up sil -- silverware
. You were allowed to keep two 
sets of silver per person. So I 
don™t know just how ma ny things my
 parents were able to save 
legitimately, but I remember them c o mi ng to ev
ery Jewish home  and collecting these items . And 
of course my father™s store was closed. You we
re no longer allowed to have a store, to run a 
business, which my -- was in my f -- grandfathe
r™s hands, and then my fat her™s hands for ma ny, 
ma ny years. There was this line and fabrique Ha
lberstadt. But it was cl
osed, and I think my 
father took a little suitcase, and 
traveled with this su
itcase to some  of his customers who were 
located in the country -- countryside some where,
 and he would continue doing some  business, 
going by train. 

Q: What happened to that shop once 
it was shut?  Did anything else 
happen there, did others take 
it over?  

A: Others took over the store, and I don™t reme mber
 exactly who owne d it at that time. But at -- 
the building always belonged to my grandfather,
 and bef -- tween the ma in building, there was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
11 
 
 
yard in the back of the main
 building, and then another hous
e, called Hinterhouse, like the 
second row of houses, and that had te
nants in it. So there were a lo
t of people living in that small 
area. Unfortunately, just to
wards the end of World Wa r 
11
, the whole property was bombed, and 
there™s none of that left, and when I went over 
there for the first time , I thought I would feel 
terrible about seeing my parent™s 
home , but it™s no longer there. So I 
did not have to feel terrible 
about a building I had ne ver seen before, built by the Russians. 
Q: Now let me  also ask, what was happening 
among your school friends?  We re -- were other 
children leaving the town even before Kristalln
acht?  What -- what did 
you notice about any of 
your friends during this time?  

Q: The friends -- circle of friends grew s maller 
and smaller. Gradually families emigrated to any 
country which would offer them asylum. My pare
nts had a quota number to come to America. 
And I know the quota number was 51 thousand and 
some thing and it would have taken one to 
two years before that quota number would come
 up. Meantime , though, othe r families emigrated 
to Chile, to Argentina, to Palestine, to any pa
rt of the world that would take them. And it was 
very hard to find a country that
 would take in a Jewish fa m
ily. For instance, in America you 
needed to have some one who w
ould guarantee that they would ta
ke care of you if you did not 
have employment. We had an unc -- my -- brot
her of my mother, Hans Marcuza was living in 
New York, and he filled out all the necessary pa
pe rs for our family. But the quota number which 
we had would not have come  due for at least a ye
ar or two after the war had started. So in the 
meanti me , my fa mily, my f -- mother and father deci
ded that it would best -- 
be best to send us to 
a safe area anywhere, and then th
ey filled out the app
lication at Bloomsbury House in England to 
-- for the ki ndertransport. 

Q: Can you explain what Bloomsbury House is? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
12 
 
 
A: Blooms bury House was the orga
nization in England, simi lar to 
HIAS in America. A Jewish a 
-- organization that sponsored particularly Je
wish children. And they 
took an -- not only an 
interest, but followed each child
 who was able to come  to England, they would follow their 
progress, and you had some thing to fall 
back upon, which was Bloomsbur y House. 
Q: I think I™m going to 
turn the tape over.  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning of Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan 
Rosenberg. This is tape number 
one, side B. Okay, if you want to continue with what you were 
saying before. 

A: We  were discussing the kindertransport a
nd Bl oomsbury House. It was summer vacation 
time, and it was, of course, afte
r Kristallnacht, so the Jewish
 school was closed. There was no 
more official school, but it was the height of summ
er, and my  mother and I always went to visit 
her mother, her parent™s home . And that was in 
St argard in Po mmern. So my mother and I were 
spending a week or two vacation in Stargard when
 my father contacted my mother and said we 
have to come  home right away because Lillyshin 
-- they called me little Lilly has guardians in 
England and she™s leaving for England next week. 
So we packed up, we left Uma in Stargard. Of 
course, this was the last time I saw her. And we 
went via Berlin to Halberstadt, and my mother 
sh -- did a great deal of shopping for me . Little 
[indecipherabl e] dresses with ma tching aprons, 
and we had a seamstress comi ng into our house, 
that was the norma l thing. She ma de a couple of 
dresses and clothes for me for the de
parture, which was the following week. 
Q: Can we back up just for a mo me nt ?  I think th
at you started to keep a diary even before you 
left. Do you reme mber when you started keeping the diary? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
13 
 
 
A: Yes, I do reme mber the diary. For my 10
th
 birthday I got a diary from my mother, and on the 
fr ont page it says tagabu, which is diary, given 
to me by mutti, by my mother, for my birthday. 
And I wrote about every day life in 
Ha lberstadt, and the little pra
nks we played as children, and 
the norma l life, really, because I was a pretty 
happy-go-lucky child, and 
did not have all the 
burdens of the world on my shoulder. So I kept this
 diary, and the first part 
of it is all written in 
German, however when I left Germany to go to
 England, being on the train and feeling very 
much alone and knowing no one, I 
wrote into the diary, and I ev
en wrote into the diary in 
Holland, which is the route we took from Holla
nd to -- from Hook van Holland to England. And 
since there was nobody for me  to communicate wit
h, and I didn't realize that suddenly I was 
really alone and on my way some
where, not knowing where I was going, I guess it became  a bit 
scary, and so I wrote into the diary. 

Q: Even before you got onto the train head
ed, you know, to Engla
nd, eventually, on the 

kindertransport, what were your feelings at the 
time  that you heard -- you were on vacation at 
that time, I believe -- what were your feeli
ngs about hearing that you were going to leave? 

A: Since that was my pa rent™s wish, to have us 
in a safe place, my parents were actually very 

clever, because when I think about how my pa
rents handled discussing this with me , I only 
realize how very wise they we
re. For instance, both my parents said, look how lucky you are. 
You will be learni ng anot her language, you will be 
seeing new people. And they just  ma de me  

feel like I was very special and ve
ry fortunate, so I believed that 
and -- and left quite happily, not 
realizing then that I would neve
r see my parents again. And of c
ourse, I must add that we were 
all in hopes that we would be 
reunited in the United States. If
 that quota number had come  
through and had not been a war declared, eventua
lly my parents would have gone to America, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
14 
 
 
and we would have joined them. And that was the 
fact with many of the other children who ca me  
to England like I did. I was not
 one of the fortunate ones.  
Q: Now before we get to the day of your departur
e from Halberstadt, can 
you tell me what else 
you reme mb er having happened at the time of Kr ista
llnacht in the town?  Were there other signs 
of things that had happened that night?   
A: Those are all very unhappy me mo
ries. I know that ma ny Jewish 
fami lies, whoever were there, 
it was the wome n, came to my parent™s home, wh
ich was alwa ys a very gracious, open house, 
very ha-happy place for people to congregate. So 
people came there just  to be together. And I 
know that eventually they all had to give up th
eir apartments and homes and I heard that ma ny 
fa milies mo ved in with my parents, and that was 
after I had left . But my me mories of the time 
when my fat her was in concentration camp, it wa
s a terrible time and great insecurity. We did 
not know if my father would come  home, if he
 would survive. We  we
re already aware that 
terrible things were happening to Jews ever
ywhere. So these were unhappy me mories, and my 
parent™s effort was to save the life™s of their children.  
Q: What other efforts do you reme mber them ma
king for the whole fa mily to emigrate?  We re 
they still trying to do that, or they tho
ught that that was not possible any more? 

A: At that time it was very diffi cult to get acro
ss the border anywhere. I believe my father would 
have had the opportunity to go to Cuba, but he di
d not want to go alone, he
 would not have left 
my mother. So unless they could have gone togeth
er, my father did not want to go alone. I was 
told that, and I think that happened after I wa
s already in England. Now, I only know that the 
fa mily I me ntioned before from the headma ster, 
those children, there were five children, would 
have had an opportunity to go to 
England on the kindertransport, but
 Herr Luntner said, either we 
all go, or none of us go. And that
™s the choice that people had. So 
that on the monument which is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
15 
 
 
today in Halberstadt at the place where all the Je
wish people had to assemble to be deported, all 
the Jewish people, and on the me n -- monume ntare the name s  of the people who were deported, 
and it has the father and mother of the Luntners 
and all five children. My parent™s name  is also 
on the same  monume nt, and I know that if my pa rents had not sent me  to England, my  name  

would have been there. 

Q: Now, when you were on vacation with your mo
ther, and you learne d that you would be going 
to England soon, what did you learn at that time
 about the people you would go and stay with in 
England?  

A: Well that™s an interesting question because my
 father™s si ster, my Aunt Lucy, Tante Lucy 
Spear was in England. In Germany she was a 
very wealthy woma n, married to a banker in 
Frankfurt, Ulya Spear. Now she became  a cha m
bermaid in England, in Manchester. So my 
parents wrote to Tante Lucy and said Lillyshin is
 going to England next week, this is the address 
of the fa mily, Mr. and Mrs. Allen, and the 
address in Rochdale, Lancashire. My aunt 
imme diately contacted the Allens, and visited the A
llens, and they were very gracious to her. So 
we had a little knowledge about the family I w
ould be going to. My aunt then wrote to my 
parents and said that I would be 
very lucky to be with such a w
onderful family and that they are 
very, very anxious to have me  come . And so we 
had a little knowledge ab
out the family I would 
be going to. 

Q: And you know, how did the ma tch 
get ma de with this family? 
A: The ma tc h was ma de through Bloomsbury House.
 People who applied wrote in about the age 
of the children, and a photogra
ph, and a little about the family and fa mily background. The 
Allens actually had tried for a different chil
d, but -- her name  was Erica, and it did not go 

through for some  reason because Erica had other fost
er parent s who would take care of her. I me t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
16 
 
 
Erica much later when we  were at school together. 
I saw -- I had seen the picture of her, and now 
I met her, so I took the place of that child, 
Erica, and they chose me  by the photograph and 
backgroundof my fa mily™s history. 

Q: Did your parents have to put up money for this? 

A: I really don™t know. If so, it probably was very little. 
I think I read some where that they put 
up some  money, but it would not ha
ve been very much. I think that
 we were just told what we 
were allowed to take with us on the train, whic
h was a rucksack and a small bag that you could 
handle by yourself. 

Q: Did you have other items sent to you, or wa
s that the only -- were those the only items you 
took from your home?  

A: After I got to the Allens, my parents send th
e little kitchen I had, out of wood. It was about 
the size of a -- the height of a dining room tabl
e, it was a good size little
 unit of a dishwashing 
sink and a little tabl e and chairs. 
And my friend Ruth had the same  
thing ma de. So they sent that 
and a very large steamer trunk. And in that steamer
 trunk was, at the very bottom, an Oriental 
rug, a runner, and a lot of linens. And of course
 I couldn™t understand why I should have all these 
linens, but they™re beautiful works of art, all 
handma de, and of course 
that was my father™s 
business. And I have always kept these linens and 
I™m using the pillowcases to this day. They are 
just very, very beautiful, and they wash b
eautifully, and it™s a constant remi nder of my 
childhood. There was also an accordion when these 
things arrived. At customs they s -- thought 
that the accordion was sent as a valuable item that
 one could se ll as an inve stme nt, so they said, 
can I play it? So I said sure. So I reme mber ri
ght ther e in the customs, where some one fr om the 
Allen™s family took me, and I took the accordion a
nd played quite well. So they were -- I was 
able to keep the accordion.

Q: We ll just going back a little, 
were you musical as a child in 
Halberstadt?  Did you play music 
or have other hobbies that you pursued? 
A: Yes, I did have piano lessons as a young child 
in Halberstadt. I had piano lessons in England 
and played Chopin, Schubert 
and Mozart and Beethoven.  
Q: Any other hobbies or interests you reme mber 
as a small -- as a young child in Halberstadt? 
A: Art was always my hobby. If I had a choice to go to a toy shop or a dress shop or a place for 

pens and pencils and paint, I w
ould certainly choose whatever ha
d to do with art. And that has 
rema ined with me  throughout my life . But then, my mother was an artist, so ma ybe I  saw her 

painting and I just took to it, and it™s some thing 
that I have enjoyed, and I have enjoyed being 
creative. 

Q: Did your mother wo
rk outside the home? 
A: I know she would not have a job, but I think sh
e was in the store downstairs for a certain time , 
but there was some one taking care of us, Alvina wa
s always there. So she mi ght have helped in 
the business, but art was my mo
ther™s hobby, and I just reme mber
 her painting a great deal.  
Q: So now let™s talk a little b
it about the -- the day -- 
the days leading up to your departure from 
Halberstadt, what you reme mber about either 
the preparations, any fa mily discussions you 
r e me mb e r .  
A: The preparations were pretty
 frantic because it was only on
e week and there was the shopping 
and the packing, and then of course my mother
 sat down with me  and said, you know, there ma y 
not be anyone there who will expl ain the facts 
of life to you. And little did I understand what my 
mother was talking about. She said, you know, you™re
 a pretty little girl, and don™t sit on a ma n™s 
lap and don™t let a ma n get too close to you. And 
I couldn™t understand what
 she™s talking about. 
I said sure, sure. I didn't realize 
until I was in my teens di d I k
now what my mother was talking 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
18 
 
 
about. She also explained me nstruation, not to be 
scared if that should ha
ppen. And of course at 
the age of 10 it™s very early to be speaking abou
t these things, especially since I wasn™t aski ng 
these questions, but my mother probably antici
pated that there ma y not be anyone there who 
would explain these things. And itwasn™t until much later that I 
really understood what that was 
all about. But my recollections in getting ready we
re all positive, because I was told how lucky I 
am and you see this [indecipherable] Ruth I was ta
lk about, she doesn™t have guardians -- she did 
eventually, and she also came to England. But 
at the time , each child who was lucky enough to 
go was considered ve ry, very fortunate, becau
se -- and by that time everyone was trying 
fr antically to get out, just to 
be secure and to save lives.  
Q: And do you reme mbe r  any discussions with your 
father as well, or mostly with your mother 
as you were leaving -- ge
tting ready to leave? 
A: The discussions were mostly with my mother, 
but the letters are more for my father because 
they were typewritten letters 
that came to England. And they
 were always good humored and 
good-natured. In none of the letters
 did it ever say, your room is
 empty and we mi ss you. It was 
always, look how lucky you are. And in my first 
letter to my parents, I wrote that ma  -- the 
guardians wanted me to call them Pop and Ma, a
nd I didn™t want to do that. But my father wrote 
back -- no, it was my mo ther who wrote, you s
ee how lucky you are, you al
ready have two sets 
of parents and I had to wait until 
I was ma rried to have a second se
t of parents. So you™re very 
fortunate. Go to them and give them a hug and tell them you l ove them, and always be gracious 
and be grateful. So my parent were extremely 
positive about everythi ng and that made me feel, 
well they know what is right and -- for me . 

Q: Do you know how it is that they wound up being 
so positive?  Do you have any perspective at 
this point, or insight as to how
 they were able to do that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
19 
 
 
A: I think it™s -- you just have to 
have very strong character to be 
able to do that. And now that I 
am older, and have children of my own, I have of
ten thought that if I were
 in that same  position 
to send children away, I™m quite su -- I am not su
re that I would have done
 that, because I think 
it is a terrible thing for parents to part  with thei
r children. As I said, there were some  who said we 
will all go or  none of us go, and it™s a dreadful d
ecisi on for parents to have to make. And I am 
not sure that I would have 
done what my parents did.  
Q: So what do you reme mber about the 
actual day that you left Halberstadt? 
A: I played the piano in the morning, and I play
ed a German s ong that I know, it™s -- what was 
it?  [speaks German here]. Because I played the pi
ano quite well, that means, do I have to go, do I 
have to go out of this town. That™s the name  of
 t hat song. And I just t
hought it was very fitting. 
And I took my diary with me , and a sandwich, wh
ich was in the rucksack. And my parents and 
my brother and Yuta, some body we knew from ve
ry good friends, came to the train station. And 
Yuta took the picture of my depa
rture at the train station. So th
e whole family, my br other, my 
parents and I are on this picture 
at the train station in Halber
stadt. And today you can see the 
same  water tower at the train st ation in Halberstad
t. It was not bombed, a
nd it™s still there. When 
I was in Halberstadt a few years ago, I went b
ack to the same  spot and had a picture taken. 
Q: So this was in the mo rning you went to the train? 
A: Yes, we went to the train from Halberstad
t to Hanover. Hanover was the next bigger town. 
And in Hanover my parents were no longer allowe
d to go onto the train st
ation, to the track to 
say goodbye. They kept parents away 
at that time. That™s why I th
ink the picture of my parents 
and I at the train is a rather rare pictur e, and 
it is used a great deal
 for teaching purposes in 
American schools and schools in Germany. So that pa
rticular picture was ta
ken in Halberstadt at 
the train station, but not in Hanover. There 
was one other boy who went with me  on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
20 
 
 
kindertransport, his name was David Wi nter. He was in England with
 me , and eventually went to 
Israel . 
Q: So your parents were able to
 travel with you fr om that trai
n platform where the photo was 
taken, to Hanover, and then that™s where they 
had to say the final goodby
e. And tell me how -- 
how was the final goodbye at th
e train station in Hanover? 
A: Well, I n -- I think my mother was sort of hidi
ng under a big collar of coat, and it™s just a very 
heart wrenching time in everybody™s lives, and suddenl
y fi -- I found mys e lf 
sitting on a train -- 
in the train with other youngsters, nobody knew 
each other, and it was a very, very strange 

feeling. I guess I looked 
out of the window and at that poin
t there was no one 
there, and I -- it 
was the first time I realized that I™m really
 alone, and where am I off to?  However, the 
kindertransport was well organized. It was a 
locked train, Nazis came in, they would ask 
questions. Do you have rings, do you have a diamond, do you have a watch?  They would ask all 

kinds of questions, but for secur
ity reasons I think everyone was ve
ry careful with their children. 
Parents would not put their childre
n at risk, so -- but they wo
uld be walking around, and finally 
we came to Holland, and suddenly the older children 
were very jubilant and so happy. They said 
that we have left Germany. This is the -- th
is is an upsetting time
, having left Germany. 
However, people got onto the train once we got 
to Holland, and they brought cocoa and cookies 
and apples, and the older children, who were 
mor e  aware of what was going on, were very 
jubilant and they sang He brew songs, the sort of
 songs they would sing at a club or at a party. 
And it was only then that I realiz
ed that we are really out of 
Germany. From Holland we got onto 
a ship, which took us across the En
glish channel. And we we re as
signed certain berths. My berth 
was the upper berth. And I had never slept in abed that was ma de with sheets and blankets, 

because in my parent™s home  we had a feat
her be d. Wa s like a huge pillow, and you got under 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
21 
 
 
the -- under the feather bed. We ll, 
I didn™t know what to do with th
is. I slept on top of the bed, I 
did not know that you had to get in between. And 
I thought it was a rather strange way of living, 
but -- so I did all the 
things that were expected and re
quired, and by morning we arrived in 
England. I believe it was Harrage. And we were all herded off the ship, and were taken to a huge, 
huge hall, with lots of benches. And we all 
had a tag around our neck with a number, like a 
cardboard tag with a ribbon. And 
you -- each per -- kid had a different number, and then you 
waited until some body c a lled your number. I guess they 
did it in English and 
German at thetime, 
just the numbers. And when my number came up, th
is -- to me  she seemed like an elderly lady, 
she was probably in her 40™s, and that was Nel
lie, Nellie Mills, the pr ivate secretary of Mr. 
Allen. He sent his private secretary to pick me
 up. And Nellie Mills was 
always very, very kind 
to me and very good-hearted. I 
had great respect for her.  
Q: So what was the first 
me e t i ng li ke  t h a t  da y?  
A: Well, Nellie told me later on that of course 
she couldn™t speak to me  in German a nd I -- cause 
I was babbling away in German, and whatever sh
e said I couldn't understand, but by my actions -
- she knew that I was wiggling around, and that I 
needed a bathroom. So t he first thing she do -- 
did, was to take me  to the bathroom, and eventu
ally we ended on another train which took us to 
Manchester, took us north, and from Manchester 
we went by car to Rochdale. And Rochdale is 
where my guardians lived. So Ne
llie was the one who took me  to my guardians. And was a very, 
very lovely house, and Mr. and Mrs.
 Allen were very anxious to ha
ve a little girl there. It was 
only later on that I found out their reason why they 
wanted to have a child in their home. It was a 

very gracious, beautiful home . They had seve
ral cars, a Rolls Royce, and a Lady Austin, a 
private chauffeur, and Mr. Allen owned a bus 
company. In America we would call such a 
company like Greyhound. It was privately owned, calle
d Yelloway. So he was the owner of this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
22 
 
 
particular bus company that rode buses from Manchester to London, or Ma
nchester to Liverpool, 
long distance bus lines. They were quite wea
lthy people. And the Allens have a son called 
Hubert. Hubert was already grown and he was in 
his 20™s. So he was about 25 years old when I 
came to them. So, you know, he couldn™t really 
be bothered with a youngster too mu ch, but he 
was always very kind to me . We
 had a very nice relationship. They told me that™s my big 
brother.  
Q: Do you reme mber -- do you reme mber the addr
ess where -- where their house was located? 
A: Yes, I do know, it was on Bent Meadows in Roc
hdale, and this county is called Lancashire. 
Lancashire is known for linens, but ha -- the 
bus company was one of the big businesses in 
Rochdale. Mr. Allen owned the company until after 
the war. It was his son who ran the Yelloway 

bus company later on.  

Q: And also, just to go back, do you reme mber
 the address where you lived as a child in 

Halberstadt? 
A: Yes, it was Halberstadt, Lilly Cohn, Vestendo
rf [speaks German here]. Vestendorf is the 
name of the street, it™s still 
called Vestendorf, 34A and B. Th
ey were two houses that were 
attached, two houses in the front and two houses in
 the back. Yes, I do reme mber the address and 
I still reme mber the telephone numbe r in Halberst
adt. [speaks German] 26
-38. But one learns it, 
you know, in German, a nd that™s why I said it 
that way, that™s the way I reme mber it.  
Q: So your first impressions, arriving to th
is ne w place in England, what do you reme mber? 
A: Well, I was shown to my room, and I cried a lo
t. I know I cried a great 
deal, because I think it 
was only then that it hit me  that no one could 
understand me . Of course, they knew why I was 
crying, because I was home sick and it was, I™m sure
, quite normal. The Allens did have my aunt 
come  to visit, because  my aunt who lived in Ma
nchester, who had a job there as a maid, sh-she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
23 
 
 
came to visit and of course that  was very exciting for me to have someone to talk to. But very 
soon the Allens sent me  to school. And they were
 very smart, because they chose the convent 
high school in Rochdale. The c
onvent high school was run by nuns, and these nuns were from 
Germany, so they all spoke German. It was a Germ
an order. And since no one could speak to me  
at the Allen™s house, as soon as I went to school, they could speak to me , and they were very, 

very kind to me , the nuns. And I wrote to 
my parents, of course, and by pa -- 
End of Tape One, Side B

24 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is a United Stat es Holocaust Memorial 
in -- Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg. 
This is tape number two, side A. So you were 
beginning to tell me  about 
the school you attended, 
and your parents corresponding with 
the nuns, I believe, at the school? 
A: My parents wrote to the nuns in Rochdale, and sa
id to them that they 
should please not try to 
change my religion because my religion would be
 very important to me , a nd my parents begged 
them to honor my background. And they did. Of 
course, it was a Cat
holic school, and every 
morning -- they would have prayers in the mo
rning and when children knelt to say certain 
prayers, and I know all of them, beca use after all,
 I me morized them in the name of the Father, 
and all these prayers that I know, but I would not 
kneel, I would sit. And no one would ever say 
anything. And eventually they actually let me  ha ve some  lessons with the Father, who was 
assigned to the convent, and the Father knew He
brew. So I had the [indecipherable] with me  
from Halberstadt, and the Father and I would sit 
in this big room with the stained glass windows, 
just he and I, and he would continue tran 
-- letting me translate what I was learning in 

Halberstadt. But that just
 lasted a little while. 
Q: Do you think religion was impor tant for you at
 this stage, this tr
ansition as a -- as a 
youngster?  Did it help you? 

A: Religion was already very deeply imbedded in
 my life, so that I knew I was different. The 
Allens were not religious people, they just kept
 the big holidays like Chri
stma s, there™d be big 
parties and certain time s. But they were not pe
ople who would to go a church, and I never went 
to another synagogue. I don™t think 
there was one in Rochdale. But the nuns were very kind to 
me  in ma ny ways. For instance, when Mrs. Alle
n was -- Mrs. Allen was rather sickly. She had 
me ntal problems of depression, and sh -- at tim
es she could not put up 
with a child around. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
25 
 
 
mi ght be doing some thing perfectly normal, what I 
would consider normal, playing with a ball or 
some thing, and that could upset her terribl y, wh
ich I couldn't understand until many years later, 
when they explained to me  that she was havi
ng me ntal problems. And that was one of the 
reasons why they thought that having a child in 
their home would be good th
erapy for her. But it 
isn™t such good therapy for a child, because I coul
dn™t understand these things. So I would either 
live with Nellie for awhile, or I 
would live with the nuns. And with
 the nuns I would frequently 
have religious debates at a very young age, becau
se I knew a lot from Halberstadt, being that it 
was a rather religious community, I was pretty we
ll versed in the Bible, 
and the -- what I have 
learned from home . So you could not change 
me , I was pretty -- pretty strong-willed. 
Q: What kind of debate would you have?  
Do you reme mber any of the specifics? 
A: No, I -- I don™t know the specifics, but I know 
that I would stand my point, I would say no, 
no, no, it couldn™t be  that way because God did it this way, or  God spoke to Moses or whatever. I 

was pretty strong about the things
 that I had learned. And I never 
did have to participate in the 
New Testament, only in the prayers that they 
had every morning. And as far as the English 
language is concerned, I l
earned English very quickly. I would 
think that within four weeks, I 
was able to understand the Allens, although I tho
ught they spoke too quickly. But within two 

months I was able to do all the 
schoolwork, like all the ot
hers, and I was on an even level as far 
as ma th and other subjects were concerned. I 
had no difficulty in catch
ing up with the English 
children. I wore the uniform of the convent, a navy
 blue uniform with a wh
ite collar, and a blue 
and red hat, and blue and red scarf, and I was dr
essed like all the 
other children in the convent 
and ma de fri e nds there, and that seemed to be 
a normal life, which I became  accustomed to quite 

quickly. 

Q: We re you the only Jewish child in the school? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
26 
 
 
A: As far as I know, the only Jewish child, yes. 
I never me t anyone Jewish while at the Allens. 
And I had very little cont act with my  fa mily, because eventually my brother came to England, 
but by that time  the Allens really wanted to keep
 me away from the family, because they wanted 
me to feel that I was their little girl. 

Q: We ll, let™s go back. First of all, what
™s the date when you arrived to England? 
A: In July, 1939.  

Q: And whe n did you brother come  to England? 

A: Approxima tely four or five weeks later, I go
t a letter from my pare
nts saying, guess what, you 
are very, very lucky, your big brother is going to
 come  to England. And my brother did not get 
out until just before the war st
arted, and he got onto a boat in 
Holland, but he was able to ma ke 
it. And he was not nearly as lucky as I was, 
because at the age of 15, he found himself alone, 
where I had some one to take care of me . He kne
w some  English and was able to get around, and 

my aunt was in Manchester, but he had a difficult 
time to just survive. But he got a job, and then 
another job, and he did very well. 

Q: So you occasiona lly saw him, but not very much, it sounds like.  

A: The Allens did not encourage me  to have any c
ontact with my aunt or my brother, and by then 
the war had started. And when the war started, th
ere were no more letters from my par ents, 
though -- the contact between Germ
a ny and England, there were no ma il -- there was not the 
usual ma il service, was completely stopped. Eventu
ally my parents would write to some one in 
Switzerland who they knew, who readdressed the 
letters to England. So they would go from 
Germany to Switzerland, Switzerland to England. We
 still ha d letters from my parents for a year 
or two. 

Q: What were they writing about, do you reme mber? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
27 
 
 
A: Every letter was a very unhappy letter. It wa
s always, can you do some thing to help us get 
out. This and this person has left Germany, we 
can™t get out. The old people were taken to a 
nursing home, so I think my grandfather was no l
onger living upstairs. And it must have been a 
very desperate time . And of course they w
ould write, why haven™t you written, and can you send 
us a picture? And this is, you know, several year
s like that. Eventually 
there were Red Cross 
letters. A Red Cross letter was 25 words. 25 wo
rds from my parents, and they came like a 
telegram, and you were allowed to write back 25 
words, and it goes back to the sender. So that 
was the only communication during the wa
r that was official communication. 
Q: Now, can you give me a better description, 
a sense of the Allens?  
Coul d you tell me each of 
their first name s, and -- and their pers
onalities, even physical description. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: Tell me more about them. 

A: Okay. Well, when I first ca-came to the Allen™
s house, Mr. Allen was sick at the time, so he 
was bedridden with something, no-not on a perman
ent basis. But he was a very patient and kind 
man, so I spent a lot of time at his bedside, a
nd he would teach me  English. He would point to 
the ceiling and say cei
ling, I would say ceiling. He would pa 
-- point to the fl
oor and say floor, 
I™d say floor. And I repeated everything that he sa
id and then he would point again and see if I 
would reme mber it. And I did fairly well. Then he
 went t -- he asked me  to bring his wallet, I 
brought his wallet. And he took out
 all kinds of change. And he 
said, this is a penny, that™s a 
threepenny bit, that™s a sixpen
ce, that™s a shilling. And so 
I said, a penny, a threepence -- I 
couldn™t say threepence, that was very hard, beca
use to put your tongue between your teeth to do 
a t-h, doesn™t exist in German. So I probably said
 tripence, but it™s threepence, three pennies. 
And sixpence, a shilling and I think 
that™s as high as it went. When I had it all correct, he said I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
28 
 
 
could keep it, it™s mi ne. That I understood. So 
I thought I was very rich, I now had all this 
change, which of course I wrote to my parents.
 I wrote, I have a penny, 
a threepence, sixpence, 
and a shilling. And my father, which I have in the 
first letter said, now that you are so rich, shall 
I send you the safe which we used to have?  Y
ou see, we no longer had the store. He said, 
because you need to put all that money in a safe
 place. So my father™s good humor always came  
through. But Mr. Allen was very, very kind and ve
ry patient, but he was a true businessman, 
very, very successful. Hubert, the son, who was in
 his early 20™s, was one who played cricket. 
He had this cricket outfit, and at Christma stime 
would sing in the Christma s carols, there were all 
these young me n, they were there. They were all a 
lot older than I was. But he was very, very 
nice and very kind to me . He was already active 
in the business at Yelloway. And Mrs. Allen 
was the typical English housewife. When I look b
ack on the times with Mrs. Allen, she was very 
spoiled, because she had everything done for her. 
She had maid service a
ll the time, she had a 
chauffeur just to take her around. And she lived
 -- could live very gr
aciously, but she had 
phobias. She thought people were laughing at her.
 I could not understand these things, because a 
youngster does not understand that. But she was a very
 kind person, and as I said, they told me  to 
call them Pop and Ma, which I did. And Hubert, 
who was the big brother. And I was very happy. 
It became  a new home  for me . By now the war 
was on one year, two years, and a ve -- at one 
time, after Mrs. Allen had been sick again a
nd hospitalized, she got a 
shock me  -- treatme nts, 
several time s while I was there. So they told 
me  that they would send me  away. And I couldn™t 
understand that. They said, well we did not know 
that the wa r would go on so long, and we will 
always take care of you, and they gave me  all th
ese stories. But I was extremely upset. I think it 
was much more upset--ma ybe more upsetting fo
r me to leave the Allens, because it was a 
second, complete upheaval. The firs
t one I was well prepared for. 
The -- leaving the Allens I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
29 
 
 
not prepared for, and I didn™t have
 that security behind me  as ha
ving parents, real parents. So 
they sent me  to Tunbridge We lls, which is in th
e south of England. Tunbri
dge Wells in the state 
of Kent. And that was a -- don™t remember the 
exact year, but probably 1942. There was still a 
letter from my parents saying th
at I should not leave the Allens, 
please stay with the Allens, but 
this was beyond my control. 
Q: Did you talk to the Allens?  Did you tell
 them that you were unhappy?  Do you remember 
conversations at the time? 

A: You know, this was like a fait accompli, they 
n -- this was it, I could not argue with anyone 
about anything, because they ma de the decisions. 
They told me  how mu ch they loved me , and I 
have all kinds of letters from th
e m, how much I meant to them, a
nd they wanted to have a child 
of their own, but I would have to be of their relig
ion and they fou -- noticed that they could never 
change my religion, I was probably too old and t
oo strong for that already. And eventually I was 
sent to Tunbridge We lls. 
Q: What was their religion? 
A: Protestant. Church of England. 

Q: And can you tell me  what -- what
 are both of their first name s?  
A: Margaret was Mrs. Allen, Margaret Allen, an
d Herbert Allen was Mr. Allen, and Hubert, the 
son. Now, the son eventually got ma rried, and I -- 
and has a d -- one daughte
r, and I am still in 
touch with the whole family. 

Q: So you were probably with the Allens for at
 least a couple years,
 or what do you recall? 
A: Two to three -- two to three years, I don™t 
know the date exactly, although in my di ary it 
mi ght record what date I went to Tunbridge 
We lls. Tunbridge We lls had a school, and I presume 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
30 
 
 
they ma de the arrangements through Bloomsbury House, because all the children who were 
refugee children were sponsor
ed through Blooms bury House. 
Q: So what age are you at about this time? 

A: By then I was 12. 12 to 13, ma ybe 13 when I got to The Beacon. The Beacon was the name  of 

the school in Tunbridge Wells, and The Beacon has b
een a ve ry big part of 
my life. Of course, I 
didn™t realize that at th
e time, I was unhappy getting there, bu
t then I suppose every other child 
who was there probably felt the same  way about 
leaving their guardians. Ca use every child who 
was at The Beacon had a guardian some where. A
nd suddenly here we were, we found ourselves 
all together. There must have been maybe 50 ch
ildren or more, of different ages, who had all 
come  to England on the kindertransport. But now 
the war was in progress for a couple of years, 
and the guardians did not realize 
that they would have these children for so long, and sent them 
to this particular school, called The Beacon. Th
ey -- the children there were in age from 
approxima tely six to 16. When I first got there 
I was a juni or. Later on we -- we became mi ddles 
and then we became seniors, depending upon 
your age group. And we shared one large 
dormitory room together for at least 12 or more girls in one room. And we  got to know each 

other very, very well. The same  girls who were 
at The Beacon then are st
ill my closest fr iends 
today. Some  of the girls stayed in England when 
the war was over, and others went to different 
parts of the world. A few were fortunate enough to
 be reunited with thei
r parents. Some  kne w 
that their parents were alive. I was among thos
e who were hoping that the parents were alive. 
But, to no avail.  

Q: Do you think you stayed pretty optimistic
 throughout this time 
period of your life? 
A: Yes, I believe so. I think I have always had 
an optimistic nature, that™s probably inherited. But 
I don™t think I ever thought about 
not seeing my parents. I just pr
esumed that when the war was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
31 
 
 
over, I™d find them some where. We  did not know th
at they were transported to Wa rsaw, not until 
several years after the war.  
Q: So tell me  about the physical 
surroundings. What -- what was the --
 set the scene a little bit at 
The Beacon. 

A: We ll, The Beacon was an old ma nsion ma ny, ma
ny years ago, and when I think about it from 
America, I think of it as a huge, huge building. 
When I went back there for a reunion after 50 
years, it™s not as big as I thought it was, it™s
 just an average big house. But it was a gracious 

building, and there was lots of 
laughter and lots of -- of good 
fun a mong the girls, although we 
lived under pretty meager conditions. This was, 
after all, wartime. Food was rationed, and we 
had a cook at The Beacon, her name  was Mrs. Ha
yward. That name Hayward was important in 
my life. Mrs. Hayward was the cook, and we had 
certain assignments to help. To either peel 
potatoes or help with the dishwa
shing. After all, there were ma
ny, many children there. The food 
was ma inly boiled fish, boiled cabbage and boi
led potatoes. So you weren't really hungry, 
because you could eat more potatoes, and you could eat more potatoes, but it was pr etty awful. I 

mean, it was very healthy food because everyt hi
ng was boiled. They did not have fats. You did 
not have oil, you didn™t have butter. These thin
gs were highly rationed 
during the war. And we 
did not see fruit, but vegetables were growing 
in the area, and there we
re beautiful, beautiful 
grounds attached to The Beacon, with three what 
we called lakes, but they were really puddles. 
What we thought was a lake, we took an old beds
tead and thought that was a boat. We  paddled 
around in that. We  i mpr ovised with everythi ng. O
ccasionally clothes came  
from America. There 
would be a bunch of shoes, and you could try them
 on, and i f a pair fitted you, they were yours. 
So we had a lot of clothes like that. Sc hooling 
was at The Beacon, it was not too great. Later on 
they sent us to a school in the town and it was call
ed Holy Trinity. It was worse. It was really not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
32 
 
 
a good school at all. I was able 
to take an exam for a special high school. Like in New York we 
have Stuyvesant High School, Bronx Science, a speci
al school. The school would have been in 
Tunbridge, we were in Tunbridge
 Wells. Tunbridge was maybe 10 
miles away. I passed the test, 
but then they -- the gover nment said I was not a Br
itish subject is what  they called it, so I was not 
able to go to the school, but c
ontinued at Holy Trinity, which was not muc h of a school. But I 
read a lot and eventu
ally, at the age of 16, I was 
still there, we all had to
 choose a career of some  
sort. Most of the girls went in for nursing. A
nd I said no, I didn™t want 
to be a nurse. And how 
about a secretarial school?
 I said no, I didn™t 
think I would like that. Th
ey said, well what would 
I like to study?  So I said art. So I di -- t
ook some  kind of art exam, probably drawing some thing 
very basic, and I was able to go to the art school. 
So I went to the school of arts and crafts in 
Tunbridge Wells, and loved it. We  drew from th
e skeleton, and Michelange
lo, and nude figures. 
And I think I did quite we ll, bu
t one of the ladies from the 
committee who took care of The 
Beacon girls said, you have to learn a profe
ssion where you can earn money. I hadn™t really 
considered that, seriously. So they told me
 that I should concentr
ate on dress design and 
dressmaking, and they did teach that at the school
, at the art school. So 
I learned how to draw 
dresses and how to ma ke patterns, very basic patt
erns. And I took an exam while at the school of 
arts and crafts for the [indeciphe
rable] of London, and I got a degr
ee in fashion at the time. I was 
still very young, and enjoyed doing that. However, 
after about two years at
 the school, they said 
you now have to take a job and earn money. And 
that™s rather difficult in the fashion field, 
especially when you have no background. So one 
of the ladies from the committee of The 

Beacon in Tunbridge Wells had dresses ma de at
 a very fancy couturier shop in London called 

Jaquemar. So I had -- they told me I would ha
ve a -- get a job at Jaquema r in London. And my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
33 
 
 
brother lived in London by that time, so that was a 
very good thing for both of us, because that -- 
from that time on, my brother and I were alwa
ys in touch, I think we saw each other daily. 
Q: Now, just to go back, when you arrived to The Beacon, were most of the other gi rls at the 

school Jewish? 

A: All the children were Jewish, all the children 
were refugee children like myself, a nd they all 
had different stories to tell. Some  were with 
very good guardians and some  were not. So we -- 

we knew all about each ot her, we were like a group 
of sisters, and I wouldsay we still are. Half 
of them now live in England, and ha
 -- maybe half in America, and 
a few are in different parts of 
the world. But th -- all the children had a similar 
background. Now, the interesting part is that I 
had a friend in New York, her name  at The Beac
on was Sylvia Balbera. Her ma rried name  was 
Schneider, Sylvia Schneider. And she lived in Ne
w York until last year, she passed away. If you 
asked Sylvia about the years at The Beacon, sh
e would give you a compl e tely di fferent story 
about how dreadful it was, not only the food, 
but the way we were dressed, and that nobody 
loved us, and nobody cared. And yet, I look at the 
same  years as saying they were productive. 
They made us realize what is im
portant in life and what is not so
 important in life. Cause we had 
next to nothing, and yet we had each other. I thin
k it taught us a great deal about the va lues of 
what is important  and what isn™ t important. 

Q: Did you also feel more comfortable being 
around Jewish friends again?  Did that ma ke a 
difference to you at the time ?  

A: I think it gave all of us a 
certain comfort knowing, for instan
ce, on a Fr iday night we could 
have prayers over the bread and wine, and basic 
things that I reme mbered from home . I  think I 
was pretty much the leader. They said I was ve
ry much of a leader type person. Whe n the s-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
34 
 
 
superior there said that to me
, I didn™t know what she was talking about, but in life she was 
actually quite correct.  
Q: So, while you were at The Beacon, what did 
you have to -- you -- you started to talk about 
how you eventually learned you needed to ma ke 
money, but while you were still studying at The 
Beacon, what -- how were you taken care of in te
rms of mone y?  Were 
the Allens sending you 
money, and -- and what did you need in
 those days in terms of money?  

A: I don™t reme mber receiving money from the 
Allens, although I visited them, I would say, 
about twice a year. I would go 
to get to London -- you had to 
get pol -- permission from the 
police departme nt that you were leaving your re
sidence, since we were known as enemy aliens 
all during the war. All the children were enemy 
aliens, cause  we were not British subjects. But 
that was not difficult, to get the permit to go. 
So I would go to London and from London I would 
get on one of their buses, to go to Rochdale, to
 go to Manchester, and from Manchester to 
Rochdale. And most of the drivers knew me  from
 the time I was a little gi rl. So I di d visit the 
Allens on a some what regular basis, and they 
always wrote to me . But now The Beacon really 
was our home. The one  thing I need to me ntion is th
at when I was told that
 I need to have a job 
in London, Mrs. Hayward, who was the cook, had he
r son and daughter-in-law as visitors most 

weekends. And they came  there by bicycle from London with a young couple, to stay with her 

because there was a lot of bombing going on. 
This was the height of the wa r, and the 

doodlebugs, which are one kind of bomb, would 
come  over the area of Tunbridge Wells, and 
they had balloon barrages up to prevent the pl anes from reaching London. However, this couple, 

Hayward, Alec Hayward -- Alec Ha
yward, right, and Agnes, would come  to Tunbridge We lls 
most weekends. And Alec was an artist. So he and I would do some  sketching together. We  

would draw The Beacon, or we would draw a tree
, or whatever, and I go
t to know this couple 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
35 
 
 
quite well. So Mr. Hayward, this is the young Mr
. Hayward, said to me , where are you going to 
live when you go to London?  And I said I don™t know 
yet. I did not know. So he said, well if you 
would like, you can live with us because we have 
a small house in West Wi ckha m, which is just 
outside of London, and we have an
 extra bedroom, and if you like 
you can stay with us. And that 
is what I did, I then lived with the Haywards
 in London. I did not ma ke enough money to pay for 
the train fare, and I paid a little 
bit to the Haywards for room a
nd board, it wasn™t very much. But 
the Bloomsbury House helped out
 at that point. So Blooms
bury House paid the ou -- the 
Haywards some thing towards my ke ep. And I earn
ed 35 shillings at Jaquemar, and I learned the 
dress trade fr om the bottom up. I started by picking up the pins off the fl oor with a ma gnet, and 

then they let me  put in some  ba
sting threads, and take out bast
ing threads. I was allowed to do 
little things, but gradually I le
arned more and more. And in E
ngland one learned a profession by 
being an appr entice. It™s not necessarily a school
. At the school I had learne d the pattern ma king 

and design part of it, but --

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan 

Rosenberg. This is tape number 
two, side B. I wanted to just 
go back a little bit and ask you -- 
back to your childhood me mories in your hometow
n of Halberstadt, can you tell me  -- I know 
you me ntioned a little bit about going to synagogu
e, but in the home, what are some of the 
favorite holidays that you reme mber ?  Do you 
have vivid me mories of holidays at home ?  
A: Oh absolutely. The holidays were really cele
brated and we looked forw
ard to them. The dress 
would be made for what to wear on a high hol
iday such as Rosh Hashanah or Yom Ki ppur. 
Course, a child is growing all the time, but it was 
a very festive time for a
ny of the high holidays. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
36 
 
 
But every Shabbat was a high holiday in my pare
nt™s home because Shabbat is every week, and 
everybody would get dressed accordingly, and even
 the photo that I have, the me n are wearing 
ties, including my brother, and I would be aske
d to sing a certain song, which is from the fr -- 
prayer after meals [indecipherabl
e] and I would sing that on a Friday night, and that was 
entert ainment for my parents. But holidays were 
always celebrated, whether it was Purim, where 
children get dressed accordingly 
and have these Purim parties, 
the story of [indecipherable]. I 
reme mber all these things from Halb
erstadt days, it™s a long time  ago.  
Q: And you reme mber Passovers as well? 
A: Passover, my mother would st
art a week before, getting out th
e new dishes, the other dishes 
that would be used only for Passover. They were
 white with just a navy blue frame and a little 
gold around. They would just be used for Passove
r. And I remember my gr andfather, Opa, going 

around the house with a feather, 
and going into the corners to s
ee if there™s a crumb anywhere. 
These are childhood me mories from way back, and 
I™m surprised that after 70 - something years 
I still reme mber such little details. But the ho
lidays were really some thing to look forward to. 
The various holidays, the Simc has Torah, wher
e children get candies in the synagogue, and 
we™re allowe d to come  downstairs to be where the me n are, which was a big treat. And that same  

synagogue today has just one wall left, but they™re 
picking up the pieces a
nd trying to reconstruct 
whatever they can of 
the synagogue the way the original synagogue was. 
Q: And I think you me ntioned this
 in one of your other -- excu
se me  -- interviews, but I was 
curious, could you tell me a little bit about wh
at your parents ma ybe sa
id to you about being 
Jewish. Did you feel special, did you
 feel different in some  way? 
A: We  were always told that we are special, 
and I grew up feeling that way. There™s no way 
anyone could have changed my religion, even though 
I was just a little over 10 years old when I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
37 
 
 
left my parent™s home. But I knew that that was a 
very important part of my life, and I also knew 
that I would never ma rry anyone who was not Je
wish, because I could not br ing up children in 
any other faith. It was already deeply imbedded in -- as part of my life. 

Q: And wha t  about -- I believe you wore the St ar
 of David around your neck and can you tell me  
what happened when you moved to England? 

A: I had this little St ar of David, Mogen Dovid 
in silver , silver filigree, it™s quite small, 

insignificant, on a silver chain. And I wore it wh
en I left my parent™s home, when I left  
Halberstadt to go to England. Of course, when I 
started going to the convent high school, was the 
name  of the convent I we nt to where my guardians
 sent me , they of course realized that the 

Mogen Dovid was not appropriate to
 go to a Catholic school. So I wa
s told then that I could not 
wear it at all, and I never did, but
 I always kept the Mogen Dovid. 
So I had it for years and years. 
Whenever I would look at it, it brought back me
mories, of course. Many years later, it would 
now be 19 years ago, our son Steven got ma rri
ed to Susan, Susan Soto. Susan was not born 
Jewish, but she became Jewish before Miranda th
eir daughter was born. So when j -- when Susan 
converted to Judaism, and that is in Fl orida, 
I don™t know the exact year
, but it is 19 years ago, 
Susan went into the ocean with her husband, 
our son Steven, because there was no mi kvah in 
Palm Beach, so the rabbi was there at the o
cean with Susan, who was pregnant with their 
daughter Miranda, and St even said, you know, my wife
 is pregnant, I can™t put her in any further. 
And the rabbi said further, she has to go downmore. She had just had her hair done for the 

wedding. Said further, she has to go down further. 
And Susan went to the so-called mi kvah in the 
ocean, she was converted to Judaism, and Susa
n received the Mogen Dovid, which I was not 
allowed to wear as a child. And Susan has the 
Mogen Dovid very proudl
y, and will pass it on to 
Miranda one day. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510

Q: That™s so nice. So, now when you are at The 
Beacon -- I know that™s wher
e we left off, with 
you at The Beacon, and I wanted to just try to es
tablish, what were some  of the other kinds of 
changes. You told me  about the air raids, I be
lieve, or ma ybe you mi ght want to speak a little 
more about that, but what other changes sin
ce the war had started, how -- how were things 
changing with -- with the war going on? 
A: The war was a very difficult time  for everyone
 in England. In London they had the ma jor air 
raids, where huge areas were bombe d. But Tunbridge
 We lls was in direct line from Germany via 
Tunbridge Wells, to London. So the bombs and th
e planes, which were called doodlebugs -- they 
didn™t have pilots, it was just a pl ane with 
a bomb that would come over. In the area of 
Tunbridge Wells and surrounding fa rm country, they
 put up these huge lines on different levels, 
and balloons, this cal -- they were called ba
lloon barrage, hoping that 
they would entangle the 
flight of any one of these planes so that they
 would not reach London. And 
indeed, quite a few f -
- fl -- planes were intercepted. 
Another thing which was typical 
of a doodlebug is that it would 
go so ma ny miles and we would hear this droning
 voi -- noise. You knew what it was, but when 
the noise stopped, that™s when the agony went of
f in all of us, because
 we didn -- it was comi ng 
down, but we didn™t know where it would come  dow
n and explode. It was really meant to go 
another 35 miles to London from where we were
. But the wa y of life for everybody was very 
difficult. We  had the air raids at night or during 
the day and people would rush into shelters. And 
the food was rationed so that it was very mi ni ma
l, what everyone received. But being at The 
Beacon, the food was less than mi nima l. They did not
 give us, I think, what we were entitled to, 

which was maybe one egg a month, because I don™t 
remember ever, ever eating an egg, or ever 

seeing fresh fruit like an orange 
or banana. I did not see those thi
ngs all the war years, not until I 
came to America.

Q: And wha t  about the correspondence with your pa
rents? If you can sort of characterize what 
that correspondence was like 
through this time  period. We  talked
 a little bit about, I think, the 
early days with the Allens -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- but going from the Allens to The Beacon, 
and when you heard from them, and then when 
you didn™t hear from them. 

A: There was very, very little in
formation for my  parents. The letters dwindled because they 
were still sending them to Switzer
land, and they would be forwarde
d to my brother or my aunt, 
and then eventually they would come  to me . Th
e letters were al ways sa
d, it was always we are 
trying to get out, we are trying to
 get by. And my  mother would us
e the phrase very often lorg 
zundt, only -- only good health. In 
other words, she was hoping that
 they would stay healthy. I 
know that because I donated all the letters frommy parents, the originals, to the museum in 

Washington, D.C., and -- except for the first and 
last letter, which we kept. My daughter-in-law 
in Florida has the fi rst and last letters. The fi rs
t one was particularly m
eaningful to me , and the 
last letter from my parents said
 we have to be at the dorm in 
Halberstadt -- the dorm being the 
big church in the center of th 
-- of town, at some thing like five o™clock in the morning, or 
some thing -- some thing very early, and we ma y 
take with us only a rucksack. And I understand 
that all the Jews assembled there, and that was in
 the last letter  fr om my
 parents. They had to 
then give up their keys, their house keys, and th
ey were deported. This was all unknown to us 
because my brother and I were in England and we
 only heard about that later on, after the war, 
and fr om the little museum in Halberstadt, and 
they have the infor mation from some  of the 
soldiers in Halberst adt, and that is how they
 received the name s of 
all the people who were 
deported. But you know, the Germans were very accurate about their recordkeeping, so they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
40 
 
 
have records of na me s and so forth, and that
 is all recorded now on that monume nt in 
Halberstadt. 

Q: When did that last letter come  to you? 

A: I believe it was in 1942. And then from wher
e they went we never 
heard. Maybe there was a 
Red Cross letter, but I™m really not
 sure. I™m only aware of this part
icular letter from my parents. 
And we were hoping that when the war was over,
 we would find them maybe in Russia, in 
Siberia, or so meplace, but it never happened. 

Q: Did you -- did they seem to know
 at all where they were going 
to be sent, in that letter? 
A: I don™t think so. I don™t
 think they knew where they were go
ing. They just wrote that they all 
have to be there early in the morn
ing and that was the fine -- the 
last  letter that I have. So the -- 
those two letters are in -- with our
 son and daughter-in-law in Fl orid
a. All the other letters are in 
Washington, D.C., and wis -- the y-young lady in
 Germany, J utta Dick, who runs that little 
museum, called Moses Mendelssohn academy, she as
ked for copies of all those letters, and 
received them with my okay. So
 she has the details of all of 
these letters, which I never read 
again. 

Q: Never?  

A: Never, no. Only the first and the last. So, I did 
not want to read all th
ose letters. I found them 
to be very depressing, and it was a subject th
at in our home, we ju
st did not discuss. 
Q: And wha t  -- what about keeping your diary?
 Did you continue writing in the diary when you 
were at the Allen™s and at The Beacon?  What
 do you -- what do you reme mber about the diary? 
A: The diary, which was started in German, fo
r a long time all the wri
ting was in German, in 
green ink, and then it continue
d later on in blue, I believe, in
k, and a comp letely different 
handwriting. You would not thi
nk it was the same person, and now
 it™s in English. And very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
41 
 
 
positive, that was at the time  I was at The Beacon 
already, when I wrote just  a few more pages in 
very good English and a completely different 
attitude, a much more positive attitude. 
Q: And also at The Beacon, were you intere
sted in boys at this
 time of your life? 
A: Oh, we had a lot of fun with the local boys, 
we really did. The Beacon girls were ve ry popular 
with the neighborhood village boys. 
The Beacon being rather an is
olated building on a hill, the 
area is called Rusthall in Tunbridge Wells, and 
it™s still called The Beacon. It is now like a pub, 
and a bed and breakfast both. So it™s well take n 
care of by a young couple at this time , because 
after our reunion of children 
being in England for 50 years,
 we went onto The Beacon, and 
visited The Beacon. And at that time some  of the 
village boys were invited to come  over. These 
village boys are now in their fi -- 60™s, but we
 knew them as kids. And they would come  and 
visit us by climbing through the baseme nt window,
 which was ground level. And when we heard 
a ma tron comi ng down the stairs, they would jump
 out of the window and 
disappear. So we had 
a very good, but very innocent time . 
Q: Okay, so now I think we™re caught up, and we
 were last talking about The Beacon and your 
transition from there to London. Do you know when 
that was, and ma ybe now you wa nt to just 
start over and talk about living 
with the Haywards, I believe. 

A: I believe the year would have been 1946 appr
oxima tely, because I was now out of the school 
of arts and crafts in Tunbridge We lls, and 
had to take a job in London. And the young Mr. 
Hayward, who was this artist, said to me , would I 
like to live with them -- of course with the 
okay of his young wife. And I didn't know where I was 
going to live, so that sounded fine to me . 
They said they would live -- they
 were living in the vicinity of
 London, a little on the outskirts. 
So then I started my job in London at Jaquema r, this very, very fancy dress house, which gave 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
42 
 
 
me  a very, very good background in basic knowledge
 of dressmaking, which came  in extremely 
useful later on in my life.  
Q: So this was -- this was actually al ready after th
e war, or is this while 
the war is still going on?  
Cause you -- 

A: The war was -- the wa r was still going on, yes. 

Q: Okay, so probably not ™46, so
 it must have been earlier. 
A: Maybe fort -- ™45 to ™46 th
at I stayed with the -- with th
e Haywards. I don™t know the exact 
date any more, but I was with them when the war ended, so I was still going to work in London, 

and being that I was working in London at Ja
quema r, my brother was also working in London, 
not too far away, and we would le -- meet at lunch
time, and we would meet at a restaurant called 

Lions, Lions Corner House, and my brother woul
d always pay for my lunches. I really d -- 
earned very, very little money. It
 wasn™t even enough to pay for th
e train fare and staying with 
the Haywards. But the Haywards had a very pos
itive influence upon my life. For instance, I had 
had piano lessons in Germany, and t hey felt that 
I should continue with my knowledge of music, 
and ma de arrangeme nts for me  to have piano less
ons every week, which I did, and I went to high 

s -- to further my education in art, I went to 
an art school at night. So
 I would work during the 
day, commute, and then go to an evening art sch
ool. So they really influenced my life  in 
continuing my education, and I was very happy stay
ing with them. They were not at all wealthy. 
They bought me  a me n™s bike. I know because it ha d 
the bar in between, and we used to visit The 
Beacon, now from London, and we used to bicy
cle there. It was 35 
miles each way. And Alec 
and his wife Agnes had a tandem and I had the 
single me n™s bike. So they were slow going 
uphill, where I would be ahead of them and going downhill they would be much fa ster. And 35 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
43 
 
 
miles in one direction is quite 
a good trip, but we did this quit
e regularly and it helped me  in 
having very strong legs to this day. 
Q: And that™s still while the war was going on? 

A: Yes, the war was still going on, and when the 
war was over, I was still with the Haywards on 
the outskirts of L
ondon. And I must say one day when I was s
upposed to take the 
train after work 
from Charing Cross to West Wi ckham where th
ey lived, I missed the train, which could happen 
when you work in London. And that train was hi
t by a bomb, and they thought I was on it. And I 
guess the good lord felt that I wa -- he wasn™t re
ady for me , so here I was saved once more, and it 
was the train that I had taken on a regular ba
sis, and that day I 
mi ssed it, the trai n.  
Q: And that™s before the war ended? 

A: That was before the war ended, yes,
 and I wa s still with the Haywards. 
Q: Did these sorts of things scare 
you at the time, or did you take th
em in stride in a certain way? 
A: When you live in London during the war, you 
just never knew where the bomb would go off, 
or when a doodlebug stopped whether it would hit 
you, or the house next door, or -- it would be 
nearby, but you were just lucky if you ma de it. A
nd we spent ma ny, many ni
ghts in the air raid 
shelter. The Haywards had a shelter in their home , 
in the hallway. It was a
bout the size of a ten -- 
ping pong table, but out of iron, and you would sl
eep under that ping pong table the mome nt the 
air raid si ren went off. And it was routine. That  could be daytime or nighttime. Of course, 

everything was a blackout at all times. No light
s from the outside, you co
uld not see which house 
had a light on. And they had air raid warden
s walking around, checking each of the houses. It 
was a way of life. And in London, ma ny peopl e ju
st bedded down in the underground, which is 
the subway system. They had bunks, one on top of 
the other, and parents,
 rather than dragging 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
44 
 
 
their children out in the mi ddle of
 the night, would just put them to bed in the subway. And they 
would be there every night, occupying these be
ds. There were hundreds and hundreds of them. 
Q: But still, you some how weren™t te
rribly frightened, it sounds like. 
A: Yeah -- no, I think I took the li
fe pretty much in stride, like 
that™s the way it™s meant to be. 
And I think even to this day, we 
are planning to go to Israel next
 week, and it™s not a very safe 
time, since we just got over this war maybe two 
weeks ago. And I feel whenever the hot time is 
to go, that™s it. Meantime, I™m positive about livi
ng -- about living every da y to the fullest.  
Q: So what do you reme mber about the war comi ng to an end? 

A: I reme mb er the huge celebrations in London, but 
I was not in -- in th
e center of town then. 
My only recollection is really that
 my brother said to me, it is time for us to go to America. Our 
parents said that we will meet 
the m again in Ame r ica. And we were still hoping that there would 
be a sign of our parent s some where. We thought
 because of lack of communication during the 
whole war, that ma ybe they were hiding some wh
ere. Maybe in Russia or Poland, or some where. 
We did not know. But we were not fortunate. Ho
wever, ma ny of The Beacon girls were reunited 
with their parents. Some  in America, some  
in Aus t ralia, and different parts of the world. 
Q: How did you feel about the possibility
 at this stage, going to America? 
A: By now I felt very English. I really didn™t wa
nt to leave England. But my brother had this 
attitude of being responsible for me , and he said, 
this is what our parents 
wanted, and that™s what 
we™re going to do. He really did not
 give me  a choice. I was about 
18 by now, and he said, this is 
what my par  -- our parent ™s wishes were, and 
we™re able to go because now the quota number 
had come  to pass. In other words, we are enti
tled to go. And my uncle who was in New York had 
given us the appropriate visa a
nd my brother ma de the arrangements for us to go, and I believe 
that Bloomsbury House paid for part of the voyage by boat to come  to America. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
45 
 
 
Q: When did you leave for the U.S.? 
A: It was in 1946, that I came to
 America. I came on a ship called the Drakninghome , and fell in 
love on the ship with a man from Canada, whic
h sounded very, very far away from Ne w York. 
But he was much older than I, but it was sort of 
a quick roma nce, but that™s as far as it went. 
Q: What was his name? 

A: Bill, yes. And my husband when he heard abou
t Bill, and that Bill was co mi ng to visit me, 
was very upset. 

Q: So you reme mber the journey fondly, going to America? 

A: Yes, the journey was a very happy crossing 
for me , it was a very broadening experience to 
say the least, however I was still listening to my
 mother, which I learned later on what that was 
all about. The journey though, was a very happy one
 and we finally reached New York, and my 
brother was here to greet me , he came before I did, 
and an aunt of mi ne were at the ship when I 
arrived. And I spent the first couple of days at
 my  uncle™s house in Wa shington Heights. The 
uncle is my mother™s brother, Hans Marcuza. 
Hans Marcuza was ma rried not too long, and had a 

little girl called Barbara. So now I met my firs
t cousin for the first time , and she was just a 
couple of months old. 

Q: What were your very first im
pressions comi ng into New York? 
A: I was not too pleased. My brother was showing me  the skyscrapers and the Hudson and 

saying how wonderful and how beautiful, but I wa
s used to a simple life in Tunbridge We lls, 
really the -- a country life, 
and I found all the brick and st
one and the ma sses of people 
overwhelming. 

Q: After that, how did you assimilate and 
adjust to being a new immi grant here? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
46 
 
 
A: I soon realized that I could not stay with my 
uncle too long. I think I 
stayed with him at the 
most for two weeks. At the time there was a newspa
per in New York, and I believe it is still in 
existence, called Aufbau, A-u-f-b-a-u. The Aufba u 
also played a role in 
my life. First day I found 
a furnished room in Wa shington Heights, which 
cost five dollars a week. So, it was a walk-up 
apartment and I just had this tiny little room there on 180
th
 Street, with a family. And of course, I 
needed to look for a job. So I went to an une
mployment agency, the regular U.S. une mployment 
agency, and there was a very nice gentlema
n there who was sort of fascinated by my 
background, which I did not find particularly fascinat
ing at all. And he helped me  to get my first 
job in sketching bridal gowns. S -- my  first job was on 85
th
 Street, very near the mu -- 
Metropolitan Museum of Art. And people would expl
ain to me  what they wa
nt, a dress with lots 
of buttons down the back and puffed sleeves orwhatever, and I would sketch it. And I was a 
pretty good sketcher, and I had a -- quite a ni
ce background from the school of art in -- in 
Tunbridge Wells. And there was a showroom and 
people who would ma ke the dresses, but my 
particular job was to sketch. Later on I would 
get a second job, and a third job, and each one was 
an improvement over the job I had before. I al
ways earned more money, and I did quite well 
money-wise. I know I started with 
35 dollars a week, and my brot
her and I thought that that was 
incredible. We thought we were so well-to-do. At
 that time I guess it was not too bad, because 
my room wa s only five dollars, so we did fine. 
And my brother and I sa
w each other regularly. 
He also took a furnished room in Wa shington He
ights, we were near each
 other. And we were 
always very, very close in our loving each other,
 and -- but my brother felt responsible for me . 
And it wasn™t too much longer, when I visite
d my other uncle, Dr. Friedel Lusch, he was a 
gynecologist in New York, on 92
nd
 Street and Columbus Avenue. 
And I went to visit Friedel 
Lusch, Uncle Friedel, and there were other peop
le there, a Mrs. Lowenstein and her daughter, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
47 
 
 
and a young ma n, and this young ma n was Jerry. I t
hought he mi ght be the husband of the other 
young woman, turned out that that wa
s his first cousin, and that was 
the aunt he lived with when 
he came to America, also on the kindertransport.
 And that™s where I first me t my hus band Jerry, 
and I was only here ma ybe a month or not much mo
re and Jerry has not left me  out of his sight 

fr om then until today, and we are married 58 years. 

Q: What year did you get ma rried? 

A: We met in ™46, got married in ™4
8, had our first child in fi -- 
End of Tape Two, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan 
Rosenberg. This is tape number 
three, side A. As you were saying before, a lot of things were 
happening to you in your first years in the U.S., right? 

A: I came to the United States in 1946, and that 
is when I met my husband-to-be, Jerry. And in 
1948 we got ma rried. In 1950 we had our first so
n, Steven, and in 1952 we had our second son, 
Ralph. So every two years, an important event happened in our lives. 

Q: So it sounds like you adjusted pretty well 
to your new life in th
e U.S.. Would you say so? 
A: I got used to life in America quite quick
ly, even though my first impulse was not so 
enthusiastic, I got used to the life
 here, which is of course, mu ch more pleasant than the life that I 
had been accustomed to in England for all the wa
r years. I had never seen
 such an abundance of 
fruit and flowers, and wealth that I had seen 
here, because we grew up in a very modest way, 

which I™m not too sorry about because I believe it
 has give n us a different perspective in life, 
knowing what is an important 
thing in life, and what isn™
t. And it™s not the wealth. 
Q: So at this stage of your life, would you have fe
lt more German, or mor e  British in your sort of 
national identity or  -- or background, if you will. 

A: I never really felt German 
any more after I lived in Englan
d, I got very used to living in 
England and would have rather stayed there,
 but my brother insisted upon comi ng here. 

However, once I me t my husband and we were ma
rried, I was able to become an American 
citizen because my husband was in the American
 army during the war, and I became a citizen 

within the first year of our ma rriage, and I w
ould not change that fo
r anything in the world. 
Q: Can you tell me about the reunion I thi
nk you had, back in England at The Beacon? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
49 
 
 
A: I don™t reme mber the exact year, but after 50 
years of children comi ng to England on the 
kindertransport, Bertha Leverton 
wrote t -- an article in some  
newspaper, saying she is looking 
for contributions of letters from youngsters who 
came  to England on the kindertransport, and she 
put together a book. The book is called, ﬁI Came  Alon
eﬂ and it has stories of
 at least 300 children 
within that book. And sh -- then 
she decided that we should give
 some  sort of acknowledgeme nt 
and thanks to England for having brought us to 
England for our safety, because without that, 
none of us would have survived, or ma ybe very
 few. But this way, whether we were happy or 
not, cause some  children were and some  were
 not, I was among the luckier ones, but some  
children while they were in England were used as
 ma ids, some were used as sex objects, they 
were not all very lucky, and -- with the choice of
 their guardians. But I go
t accustome d to living 
in America a -- quite quickly, and 
that has become  our wa
y of life, and of c
ourse our children are 
born in New York, and they don™t know anything else. 
Q: And how did it feel to go back to th
is reunion? Wa s it emotional for you? 
A: It was emotional for ma ny of us, because it br
ought back things that we would just as soon 
not think about. Everybody was talk
ing about their past, they had 
groups together who lived in 
different parts of England so that they woul
d have a chance to meet again. And people came 
from different parts of the worl
d to this particular reunion in
 London. And that was the beginning 
of other chapters of the kindertransport starting 
up. There is an organization in New York called 
kindertransport link, I believe. They have a news
letter for all the people who were children who 
came to the New York area. But that happened also
 in California and in Florida. So they have 
different groups of people getti
ng together on a regular basis, w
ho were all children who came to 
England with the kindertransport.  

Q: And whe n you were back in England for this reunion, di d you go to The Beacon?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
50 
 
 
A: We  did. Those of us who were there from 
The Beacon, that mi ght have been about 12 or 15 
Beacon girls and their husbands, because now, mo
st people were ma rried and with children at 
this ti -- point. So, ma ny husbands came  along, a
nd we all visited The Beacon for one day. It was 
closed to the public, and of course it was wr
itten up in ma ny newspapers. But The Beacon still 
exists, and it brought back a lot of me mories, b
ecause that which are now elegant dining rooms 
with tables and white tablecloths, and very, very
 pretty, and a beautiful
 setting, that was our 
dormitory, that was our room, and that™s where 
the Rusthall boys came to visit us. So it brought 
back a lot of me mories. 
Q: How ma ny girls in total were at Th
e Beacon when you were there, do you know 
approxima tely? 

A: At least 50, in different -- different ages, a
nd they were divided up into junior, mi ddles and 
seniors. I started as a mi
ddle and ended as a senior. 
Q: Now, when you arrived to the U.S., were 
you still hopeful that you would find your parents, 
or hear from your parents? 

A: By the time  I got to the U.S., there was little hope, because we had not heard anyt hing. But 

we heard from s -- some people -- I mentioned the 
name  Rut h Lindheimer in Halberstadt, the girl 
I went to school with, she was in England also w
ith the kindertransport, but her father was in 

New York, and he was in the American army, he 
served in the war. And Ruth™s father knew of 
other people from Halberstadt w
ho are also living in New York, 
so he had some  contact with 
other people. And they some how 
received a list which was published in the Aufbau newspaper. 
And in that list, which a soldier 
had on him, the soldier had the lis
t of these people, an American 
soldier, I believe, and he gave 
it to the Aufbau, the Aufbau publis
hed it. It had the name s of all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
51 
 
 
the people who were transporte
d to Warsaw, which we did no
t know, we never really knew 
where they were transported to. 
Q: So this is the fi rst concrete information -- 

A: Mm-hm, right.  

Q: -- and then, did you know where they ma y ha
ve gone, or -- when did you find out anything 
else, or did you find out? 

A: [indecipherable]. We  actua
lly never found out anything else
. We  don™t know a specific date 
when they were possibly killed, but we  just don
™t know. All we know is the monument which is 
in Halberst adt at the dome where all the Jewish 
people had to assemble to be deported, and it has 
the date of birth, and it does
n™t have a date of death. 
Q: And so it sounds like that transport, did a
nyone ever find out if that transport when to 
Auschwitz, or it went  some where else? 

A: We nt to Warsaw. It went to Wa rsaw, they a
ll went to Wa rsaw, that™s all we know. What -- we 
-- we don™t know any details after 
that and I don™t think that th
ere were even any Red Cross 
letters, any more fr om the camp. But in my -- the la
st letter from parents, they wrote that Oma in 
Stargard, the -- that™s the other 
grandmother, and her daughter, we
re also deported to Poland, but 
we don™t know any details. We  also don™t know what happened to Opa in Halberstadt, the one 

who lived above us. I believe he was sent to lik
e a nursing home , but we 
were trying to find his 
grave when we were there a few years ago, and 
we could not find it. We  found the grave of his 
wife, Zelma Cohn, and it™s in the Jewi sh cemetery 
in Halberstadt. It™s written in Hebrew, and a 

rabbi, a present rabbi from Berlin ma de a rubbing 
of the gravestone and sent us the translation, 
which was really quite warm a
nd heartwarmi ng. So that was Ze
lma Cohn, born Lusch. And that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
52 
 
 
gravestone is there in Halberstadt, but we c
ould not find Opa, Hugo Cohn, we don™t know where 
he was buried.  
Q: But your grandmother, when did she pass away? 

A: When I was about two or three y
ears old. So that was a normal burial. 
Q: So was there any point at which it really 
sank in for you that you wouldn™t see your parents 
again, and when was that? 

A: There wasn™t really any one particular day 
or one particular time . 
The only thing that we 
know concrete is the list of na me s that they were
 deported. So we know they were there, and we 
know very few survivors came from 
Wa rsaw. We just never heard. 

Q: And so the last time that you saw 
them was at that train station? 

A: Mm-hm, yes. The last picture I have is the pi
cture in Halberstadt on the day that I departed on 
the kindertransport. And my pare
nts came  with me until Hanover,
 where the actual train, which 
was a locked train, they just took the children fo
r the transport, no parents were allowed on the 
platform at that time. 

Q: Now this photo, plus I know othe
r photos are items that you™ve been
 able to hold onto for the 
rest of your life. 

A: Right. 

Q: Can you tell me , just about the photos right 
now, how it is that you ma naged to do that, and 
that one photo from the train st
ation, did you have that throughout
, or was that sent to you at 
some point? 

A: My parents sent it to England ju
st as soon as I got there. They 
sent it to the Allens, and I left 
Germany with a considerable number of old phot
ographs, family photographs. They have been 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
53 
 
 
copied and reproduced, and a -- the 
copies are in the little museum in Halberstadt at  the Moses 
Mendelssohn academy. But I have the originals right here. 
Q: And so you probably always 
felt that it was very importa
nt to -- to hold onto these 
photographs. Did you feel that fr
om a very young age already? 
A: Yes, I always felt that that is my heritage, th
at these were the most pr
ecious things to me , and 
these are items that cannot be reproduced, I mean, if I would lose them. 
And I thought I did this 
year, because I had the young lady from Halberst
adt visiting us here in Ne w York, we were 
sitting at this same  table in our apartment, a
nd we went through my history and so forth. And 
when she left, I was looking for the family album, and I couldn't  find it. So I called Ge rmany 

frantically, and yes indeed, she took the whole albu
m, with all these origin
al pictures, and I was 
very, very upset, and told her so, but she said, 
well I needed to ma ke c
opies of them, a nd how 
else could I ma ke copies?  She took the whole book, 
and I™m glad to say, it™s back in my hands. 
Q: And wha t  other objects -- when you did come  
to the U.S., what other objects from - -  from 
your past did you bring w
ith you at that time ?  

A: The diary which we referred to before, I fo
rgot that I had that, and it showed up quite 
unexpectedly about -- what it™s -- 1987, that™s ma
ny, ma ny years after we -- 
I was in America, I 
came over in about ™46, I came to America. So 
until ™87, we moved into the present apartment 

where we are, and by -- in the move, I came acros
s this diary, which I had forgotten that I had, 
and I though to myself, oh gee, 
if my children ever see this old book, and the hat I wore when I 

left my parents on the day I came to England, 
I kept the diary and the hat. Why, I don™t know. 
And I showed it to our children on a particular 
Passover when the whole family was together, I 
said, ﬁI came across these items and someday you
™re going to say, why did my mother keep this 
old hat?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell that™s the hat I wore when
 I left Germany.ﬂ And I donated that hat to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
54 
 
 
museum in Washington, D.C.. I understand it™s on s
how there with the picture of my  wearing the 
hat. 
Q: And were you surprised when you re-read your
 diary? Was there anything in there that 
surprised you, or you hadn™t reme mbered? 

A: Yes, I am not one to go back over old letters
 or old things too happily, because it some ti mes 
brings back unhappy me mories. So I would just as
 soon not really read 
the old letters, but one 
day I translated the whole diary 
into English, because if my c hildren wanted to know what it was 
in that diary, they wouldn™t understand the Germa
n. So I translated it page for page, and ma rked 
each page with the number where you can find it in the actual diary. 

Q: Wa s that a difficult process for you? 

A: We ll, the English and German is not a proble
m for me  be cause both languages are identical. I 
have no problems speaking either one, but emotiona
lly it brings back things
 that I™d just as soon 
not think about.  
Q: Do you think that™s helped you in a way, not 
to dwell on the me mories, the bad -- the -- the 
difficult me mories? 
A: I believe so. I don™t believe in dwelling on di
fficult or bad times. I would rather think about 
the positive, but that ™s the wa
y I am, it™s the -- my nature.  
Q: And wha t  about with your ch
ildren?  Did you talk much about  your experiences as a youngster 
with your children?   

A: No, didn™t talk about it at 
all. Our children were born in Ne
w York. We  lived in a small house 
in Middle Village, and they grew up with all 
the other neighborhood Amer
ican children. We nt to 
school at the public school in -- in the park, 
very close to home. And 
actually the conversation 
never came up, even though my husband and I both sp
eak Ge rman fluently, we really did not use 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
55 
 
 
the German language. My husband was also born 
in Germany, he was born in Göttingen, but at 
home  we just spoke English, with one excepti
on. When Jerry™s mother, my husband™s mother 
came to America after the war a
nd I me t her, she didn't speak English, she would speak German. 
And I always understood it, but I hadn™t used th
e language for so ma ny ye ars in England. So she 
would say well, why don™t you answer me  in Germ
an?  And I really hesita
ted to speak German, 
but the more she insisted and the more sh
e spoke German, I unde
rstood everything, and 
eventually I would speak to her, 
so the children would hear a little
 German here and there, when 
-- you know, when the grandmother came to visit, which was every weekend. But my husband 
and I only speak English at home. But a ga --
 regarding whether we spoke about our childhood 
and kindertransport, I didn™t. I don
™t think the children were even aware of any of this, except 
that we visited the Allens with the childre n when 
they were about five and 
six years old, we went 
to England and visited the Allens, who were, of c
ourse, very, very proud to have me  back and to 
see our children, and they were ve
ry, very kind to us. And at one time they came to America and 
visited us in our little house in Middle Village
. So there was always this connection, and I told 
you that I am still in touch with
 the granddaughter, very much so. And just a year ago the 
granddaughter, with her seven children, came to vi
sit our son in Connecticut, and then to our 
house. So it™s like part of my lif
e is definitely in England. 
Q: Why do you think you didn™t ta
lk much about this, or at 
all, with your own children? 
A: I don™t know that it was deliberate, except for 
the fact that I wanted 
the children to have a 
very happy childhood, and I didn't believe in bur
dening them with anything that was an 
unpleasant past. But the time  did come when they
 started posing questions
. And the first question 
I reme mber, the boys are only 14 mo nths apart in 
age, one of them saying at Thanksgiving time, 
they were now in public school, saying, ever
ybody is going to their grandmother™s and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
56 
 
 
grandfather™s house, why don™t we have grandpa
rents?  So now the question came from the 
children, and I told them in short that there was 
this bad man in Germany, and because of that I 
came to England, and I said, you know, Pop and Ma 
in England, and of course they did, because 
they had visited and they knew th
em very well by now. And I sai
d, well that™s why I came  to 
England. But I would ma ke it very short, I neve
r dwelt on it, and neither
 did my husband. It was 
just, when they asked a question they got a real 
answer, but we never talked much about politics, 
we just wanted them to have a happy childhood. 
Q: So now if you would tell me  
about what happened with the othe
r items, this sort of surprise 
phone call that you received, other items  that 
wound up being -- belonging to your family, and 
that you didn™t even know about. 

A: All right. Well, it
™s just a -- a little over a year
 ago, in 2005, and we™re now in 2006, I 
received a phone call from this woman in Halb
erstadt, Jutta Dick at
 the Moses Mendelssohn 
academy, and she said, ﬁLilly, I had a phone cal
l from somebody called Horst Hesser, do you 
know Horst Hesser? ﬂ And I said, no, I don™t. She sa
id, ﬁDo you know Horst? ﬂ So I thought about 
it, and I said, ﬁWell the only Horst I know is th
e doll I had. My little doll I played with in -- in 
Germany was a boy doll, and his name  was Horst.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁThat™s the only Horst I know.ﬂ But I 
must have called that Horst after -- that 
doll after some body, some body 
I liked, but I couldn™t 
reme mber. She said, ﬁWell, Horst Hesser is trying
 to reach you, and he says he has some  items  
that belong to you.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, that can™t be
, I -- I just don™t know anybody.ﬂ So she said, 
ﬁ Well, he said he has certain belongings from yo
ur parents and he has looked for you all his life, 

and he just found you through the in
ternet, through the computer.ﬂ 
We ll, apparently Horst Hesser 
has a son-in-law and he is very creative with th
e computer and Horst has said to him at various 
times, could you put in the name  of either Vann
a Cohn or Lilly Cohn and see what happens. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
57 
 
 
over the years, nothing happened. And Horst said th
at when he went to Halberstadt, he would 
always ask, what happened to that family, C
ohn, and anyone he would ask would say, we don™t 
know, or we™d rather not talk about that. So this time  this son-in-law put in the name  Lilly Cohn, 
Halberstadt, and it came  out that it said, Lilly 
Cohn, Halberstadt is now Lillyan Rosenberg, tour 
guide in New York. So he was extremely excited a
nd went to see his father-in-law and told him, 
I think I found her. So one thing 
led to another, they contacte
d the guide association in New 
York and said, do you know Lillyan Rosenberg?  
And they said, oh sure we do, because  of 
course, they speak different langu
ages and I did tours in German. 
They said she was president of 
the multilingual guide association. He said, well how
 can we reach he r?  So they told him how 
they could reach me , and that is how Horst calle
d Halberst adt and she told me to get in touch 
with Horst. So now I called him, and one f -- mo
r ning I called, and of course my Ger man is 
fluent, and I said to him, ﬁHere is Lilly Cohn.ﬂ
 And he said, ﬁAre you the little girl I played 
with? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI don™t kn
ow, I can™t reme mber.ﬂ He said, ﬁWell,
 if you are the one,ﬂ he said, ﬁour 
parents were very good friends and they used to
 have coffee and cake at
 your house, and you and 
I would play under the table and do 
some  crayoning or play.ﬂ I must 
have been all of seven years 
old at the time. And sh -- he said, ﬁWhile I am 
speaking to you, I have pain
tings in front of me , 
and these paintings were done by your mother, andthey have your mother™s signature.ﬂ And so I 

said, ﬁThat can™t be.ﬂ He said, ﬁYes, I have several items from your parents.ﬂ And he told me  

that his father and my fa ther were doing busine
ss together. So I believe that after my father™s 
store was closed, he still sold linens by going to
 people™s houses, or business, I don™t know. But 
with a suitcase I rememb er him getting on the train and that was after the st ore was cl osed, 

before concentration camp. So apparently he
 knew this fami ly well. So ma  -- now -- 
Q: And whe r e -- and where were
 they, where did they live? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
58 
 
 
A: They now live in a different town called Schwer
in, but at the time , his father and my parents 
lived like 10 miles apar t. He -- the father of Hors
t and fa mily, they lived outside of Halberstadt, a 
real farm country. Like we ha
ve Pennsylvania Dutch, real country. There™d be one house here, 
and a half a mile away, another house. That™s 
how his parents lived. So apparently, during the 
war, my father said to Horst™s father, would 
you come  and ge t some  of our precious belongings 
in case we ever have to leave our home  
and would you hold them for safekeeping?  So 
apparently, Horst™s father, at gr
eat risk to his own life, came in the mi ddle of the night with, I 
think a horse and buggy, and took furniture and carp
eting and silver and paintings, a s -- little 
statue, and various items from my par ent™s home, and he drove them during the night because 
nobody would see him where they live, and he hid them in a barn. So these items were hidden in 

a barn all the war years. And of
 course, eventually, my parents 
had to leave home, their ho -- our 
home . And after the war, Horst™s fa ther said to 
his two sons, who were now teenagers, ﬁWe have 
belongings fr om a Jewish fa mily, the fa mily 
Cohn, and I™m trying to find them, and if I don™t 
find them, I want you to promise me
 that you will always look for 
them, and we have to return 
these items to that family.ﬂ So I couldn™t belie
ve what was happening. But 
it was just a year ago 
in July that we ma de arrangeme nts then to co
me  to Halberstadt and that Horst and his wife 
would come  to Halberstadt, and then my husba
nd was comi ng with me , of
 course. And the two 
sons said, ﬁWell then, we™ll go too, because
 if you™re going, we™ll go.ﬂ And the three 
grandchildren said, ﬁWell if you™re
 all going, we want to go, too.ﬂ So
 on July of nine -- of 2 - 
‚05, we all arranged to be in Germany. So it was 
the two sons, one daughter-in-law, and the three 
grandchildren and my husband and I, we all went
 to Halberst adt and we met Horst and his wife . 
They are also in their 70™s, like I am, but he™s
 a little bit older, and they™re a very charmi ng 
couple. And we spent a few days with them in Ha
lberstadt. And there were
 great festivities, if 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
59 
 
 
one ma y call it that, because there was the press,
 and television and newscasters, all at the 
museum where this took place. And some student
s, and outsiders. It got a tremendous lot of 
publicity and Horst returned the paintings to me, a
nd a whole set of silverware with the initial C 

for Cohn, and a little statue. It took quite awhi
le, but eventually it re
ached our home in New 
York, and we are now blessed to have the paintin
gs and the silver and th
e statue in our home . 
Q: I want to ask you first of all, when™s the fi
rst time  you ever went back to Germany after the 
war?  Te ll me  a little bit about that.  

A: We ll, I was once in Germany whe n I was worki
ng at the German national tourist office, and I 
acco-companied American tourists to Germa
ny, and I was more or less the interpreter. 

Q: And whe n was that? 

A: In 19 -- approxima tely 1974. I worked at the ge
r -- Germa n tourist office for five years and 
gave advice to American travel agents and t
ourists who were thinking of going to Germany. Of 
course, I don™t reme mbe r  Germany as such, 
I only know the ma p, and I s t udied that. But 
eventually I had to take American
 travel agents to Germany, and 
I would have a local tour guide 
over there explaining things to me  in German, 
and I in turn interpreted it into English. 
Q: So tell me , how did it feel the first time 
you were back in Germany, how did that fe el? 
A: I decided that I will think of 
it as if I was in Scandinavi a,because it was all strange to me 
anyway, and I did not like the 
idea of going to Germany, and on 
my own, I would not have gone. 
But that was business, and I did what
 I had to do, and it was successful. 
Q: Did you feel uncomfortable aroun
d Germans, especially if they
 were of a certain age, old 
enough to have been active during that time ?  

A: At times very much so, because -- 
End of Tape Three, Side A 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
60 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan 
Rosenberg. This is tape number 
three, side B. So you were telling me  about your interaction with 

every day Germans, I guess whether that first trip
 to Germany, or tourists who ca me  here and 
any of the discomfort that you ma y have fe
lt in the earliest times that you can recall? 
A: I did not go to Germa ny voluntar
ily, but since it was part of my 
job, I decided that if I didn™t 
do it, some body else would be doing it. And we visited a synagogue in Worms in Germany, and 

my question was to the guide who showed us
 around, who was wearing a yarmulke, you know, 

skullcap, a-are there any Jews who ever come  
here?  And he said no, there were no Jews who 
came to Wo rms, but they built a token syna
gogue like a goodwill, restitution thing. But the 
synagogue is used at times by American soldiers w
ho are stationed in the vi
cinity. So it was used 
there, but otherwise there were
 no Jews who ca me back to Worms, which was a very active 
Jewish community before the war.  
Q: So that was your trip in
 the 70™s, is that right? 
A: Right. 
Q: And then you were starting to tell me  about
 perhaps feeling uncomfortable, even German 
tourists -- did it ma ke you uncomfortable some
time s to meet Germans who you wondered about 
what they had done during the war time?  

A: We ll, very often they would ask me political
 questions. Now that I was dealing with them -- 
with Germa n tourists in America. But I -- I 
would turn that around very quickly by saying, my 
job is to tell you about America, and I want to 
tell you about the Empire State building, or the 
Chrysler building, or whatever, and I never real
ly went into my background. It was only once, 
when Ger man tourists introduced themselves on 
one of my longer tours, where I have people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
61 
 
 
comi ng up to the mi c, and they say, I was a teache
r in Frankfurt, and the other one says, oh I™m 
also from Fr ankfurt, so they got to know each
 other. And this one woma n said she™s from 
Halberstadt. So that took me  by surprise, and I di
dn™t know just how to handle that. And I did not 
tell her that I was born there unt
il the last day when I took them 
to Kenne dy airport. I decided on 
my way there that I would dec -- would tell her ab
out it. And I asked her what kind of work they 
were doing, and she said, we ma de uniforms in Ha
lberstadt. So I wasn't  too happy, and I did not 
want that to be the conversation on the whole 
tour, because I™m dealing with Germans, and 
Australians, or Austrians and English, they coul
d all be in one bus, but I really didn™t wa nt to 
have that as a conversation piece. So in genera
l I avoided havi ng these kind of conversations. 
Q: Now whe n™s the next time you we nt to Germa
ny, and what were the circumstances of that 
journey? 
A: We got this letter from Jutta Dick from
 the Moses Mendelssohn academy in Halberstadt, 
Germany, sa ying we would like to invite you to
 come  over to -- to Germany, and this was 
approxima tely year 2000, approxima tely. And she sa
id, would we be willing to address some of 
the students of the vicinity, and it was ma inly b
ecause of the diary I kept, because I sent a copy 
of the diary, I think it™s about 66 pages, I sent
 a copy to the museum in Ha lberstadt, because 
they™re trying to show what life was like in th
at community. And that ta
gabu, this diary of mi ne, 
which I have  right here, became a textbook for the student s in the area. And they studied my 

background and the way of life in Halberstadt. 
So she asked if I would address students and 
come  over there and s -- that 
they could a -- meet some body a nd 
speak to me directly. So my 
friend Ruth Oppenheime r , who I me ntioned befo
re, and her husband, and my husband Jerry and 
I, and one lady from Israel, her naveda -- name  is
 Judith Beerun, and she goes to Halberstadt fr -- 
quite frequently from Israel, she is older than I 
am. We were allin Halb
erstadt together, and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
62 
 
 
had interviews, mostly at the museum and some
times at a school where students of a -- an age 
about 16 to 20 -- not the youn -- ve
ry youngest, could ask questions
, anything they wa nted. And 
being that my German is  quite fluent, they -- 
they would speak to me  
and give -- and I would 
answer their questions. I also offered them that if
 they had any questions th
at they could write to 
me  and I would answer their lett
ers, which indeed I did. One of 
the letters which is outstanding 
in my mi nd is where a young student wrote to 
me, of course all in Germa n, I was born in 
Germany, a nd wherever I go in the world, wherever 
my parents and I travel
, people always refer 
to us as Nazis. What can I do about it?  After a
ll, I wasn™t even born. What can I help what my 
grandfather may have done, and so
 forth. So I gave it quite a bit 
of thought how to answer such a 
letter. And I wrote back and I answered every lett
er, but this came  up in several versions. And I 
said, you know, you are not responsible for thin
gs that happened before you were born. But 
you™re very responsible for all th
e decisions you make in your lifet
ime. And therefore, all I can 
tell you is that you do not have to
 feel guilty for things that ha
ppened before your time , but be 
very sure that whatever decisi
ons you ma ke in your life will be
 the right decision, and not only 
because of the ma jority doing it. So I ho-hope 
that I gave the youngsters the proper advice.  
Q: Did you feel -- on these trips to Ge rmany, didyou feel a certain inevitable resentme nt toward 

Germans, to ward Germa ny? 

A: I must carry on for what I just said. I feel
 that the young people are not responsible for that 
which happened before their time. I look at the ol
d people in a different wa
y. And yet I feel life 
must go on, and we must be positive. I cannot say 
that one can ever forg
et the type of childhood 
that I had because of the loss of
 my parents. I cannot forgive th
em for that, but I cannot hold it 
against all the Germans, because I 
think they™re doing the best they 
can to help Israel, and I have 
found ma ny, ma ny positive things, 
including some  very, very good pe
ople, including this Horst 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
63 
 
 
and his wife. They had, for instance, the various
 pieces of silver for my parents, which my 
parents mi ght have hidden some whe r e, I don™t know, and that was distributed among the various 
me mbers of the family. And yet when they heard 
that we were comi ng to Germany, they all gave 
it back and we have all these things from 
all the various me mbers. So there are ma ny good 

people, and we have to realize that and go ahead. 

Q: What about Horst hims elf?  During the war ti
me, was he of age to be in the German army?  
A: I believe he was first in 
the Hitlerjugen -- youth -- 
children™s you -- Hitler youth, and later on 
he was in the German army, and he was imprisone
d. And he is quite a character, and when we 
visited him in Schwerin, which is where they live 
now, there™s this old cas
tle, and he showed us 
the castle, and he said, I was imprisoned in that 
castle and I jumped out of the window over there 
and trotted for miles and miles and miles along th
e train track. And he told us the weirdest 

stories. I mean, he™s quite a character, but they
™re very, very good people. Yes, he was in the 
German ar my, and it wasn™t until the war was over that his father told his sons that they have the 
items belonging to my family. 
Q: Now, in particular, you said there are paintings by your mother. Can you describe the 

paintings that you received from Horst? 

A: We ll, when I first saw the painting, when we 
me t Horst last year, I realized that I had a 
photograph from my par ent™s home, because I ha
d quite a few old photographs, but on that one 
photograph is the living room of 
my parents, and in the corner
 of the living room, on t he one 
corner, is this big painting, and that is the paintin
g that he had, and another, smaller one. Also, I 
had one painting in my suitcase for the Allens, so 
it was a pr -- a pr -- a pr esent from my mother 
to the Allens when I came to England, so ther
e was always one small painting, which is in our 
son™s house, the Allens gave it to me . And now we
 have the two big paintings which Horst gave 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
64 
 
 
us, and of course it has change
d our whole atmosphere in our ho
me , they just look like they 
belong there. 
Q: Describe them. What are they 
paintings of, the three in total? 
A: The one which my son in Connecticut has isof the Hartz mountains, 
and it™s a river and going 
over a lot of stones and just countryside. The other 
one is -- the very large one, is a big church in 
Stargard in Pommern. Hors
t™s wife did some  research by going
 to vari ous libraries to locate 
which church could that be, and 
she located it as the church in
 Stargard in Pommern. And the 
smaller picture is the fish ma rt in Halberstadt, 
which is still there now. 
There is a round fountain 
in the center of town, and that seems  to be qui
te a landmark with Bucco fr om Halberstadt in the 
background on the new town hall. Because the new 
town hall was bombed, but they must have 
had Bucco hidden some where, Bucco is still there. 

Q: How did it feel for you to be in your hom
etown?  I guess the first time you were there was 
2001?  Or -- 
A: No, just e -- no --  
Q: -- you didn™t go back. Describe when you first -- 

A: We ca me from Berlin a -- because we met our
 children in Berlin si nce the whole family was 
joining us to meet Hors
t. I had never been back
 to hal -- oh no, I had been in Halberstadt when 
we spoke to the students, and I was very much af
r a id that I would feel very badly when I would 
see my parent™s home. But when we got to my parent™s home , and they told me  this is 

Westendorf, and the exact address, the post office is
 still there, but vis-à-
vis the post office where 
my parent™s home was is now a very ugly build
ing which was built by the Russians in their st yle 
of building, which was very unattractive. Like a 
factory type house. So I 
did not associate with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
65 
 
 
that building at all. I had no feeling for that build
ing at all. So that whic
h I was afraid of, never 
happened. 
Q: Let™s see what other questi
ons I wanted to ask you. So, on 
-- is there anything else you 
wanted to mention in terms of the reunion with 
-- with Horst?  Anything 
else that -- that we 
haven™t covered?  Cause I know that was a very
 -- I mean, this was really a dramatic 
development, I mean something that just
 really took you by surprise, it seems. 
A: Absolutely. And it --  it was an absolute surp
rise, but I must say, it was one of the more 
pleasant surprises in my  lifetime. Cause no one 
could have ever predic
ted that over 70 years 
would -- would come  -- go by and some one woul
d come  up a nd say, I have belongings from 
your parents. I mean, it was some thing that I 
could not have even dr
eamt up. It™s just so 
unpredictable. And then they turn
ed out to be such warm and ki
nd people. So that I speak to 
Horst every week, even it™s a year now that we
 are back from over ther
e. And his son-in-law 
writes to us on the email, so we know what is 
happening. In fact, my hus band and I are trying to 
figure out what we can do for them, a nd we™v
e come  up with various suggestions. We ™d like 
them to come and visit us, for instance, in New 
York, but he has said it™s too far, his doctor 
would not let him fly that far. So then we cameup with different suggestions, but we have not 

gotten together yet. I think eventual ly we will 
fl y to Germany and invite them some where, or 
maybe meet again in Halberstadt, something like that. 

Q: Do -- does this episode in any way change ju
st some  of your feeli
ngs about going back to 
Germany again?  You say ma ybe another future trip? 

A: Mm-hm. Yes, I feel much more relaxed a
bout going back to Germa
ny. By choice I would 
have never gone, but when we were fir -- invited 
to go ther e to speak to the student s, I felt that  
that could be my contribution to history. To do some
thing, to let them know th
at this is not just a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
66 
 
 
story, that this is indeed true
, cause here I am, and you can speak
 to me. And I told the students 
then, if it had not been for Hitler and the Nazi 
period, I would be one of 
them. I woul d have lived 
here possibly for the rest of my
 life. But because of destiny, it was different, and I had no control 
over that. 
Q: Because, of course, your fa mily felt very German, right? 

A: Oh they -- my fa -- father said, nothing canhappen to us. After all, I served in World Wa r 
1
. I 
was on the front, I was a -- a soldier, I fought fo
r the Fatherland. That couldn™t -- nothing could 
happen to us. But we all know that 
that™s not the way it was, but they
 felt very German, just like I 
feel I am an American, and I™m sure that my 
children feel a hundred percent American, they 

were born here. But our parents felt the same  wa
y about Germany. They di
d not feel different. 
They had been in Germany for hundreds of years. And they felt that n -- they -- they were 

Germans, just like we are Americans.  

Q: Now, I think there is one othe
r item that was in your fa mily™s 
possession, that there™s another, 
separate story about this item, because it was no
t returned by Horst, but 
it was still -- still 
some where else. Can you tell me  about that? 

A: Yeah. We ll, when I me t Horst, I said to hi m,
 the only picture I actually reme mber from my 
childhood is a picture of Moses. 
And to the best of my knowle
dge, the whole picture, in my 
mi nd, was done in Hebrew letters. Because I can 
reme mber standing in front of that pi ctur e, 
since I was always interested in art, sayi
ng how can some body ma ke a picture by using only 
letters? So that™s what I reme mbered about th
e picture. So he said, ﬁOh, you mean the Moses 
picture with the 10 commandments?ﬂ I said yes. 
I said, ﬁThat™s the only thing -- I wonder where 
that is, because if it™s only 
in Hebrew letters, there can™t be
 ma ny of those around, it must be 
some where.ﬂ So he said, ﬁOh, my sister had it. She 
gave it to the Jewish museum in Be rlin.ﬂ And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
67 
 
 
that™s the old Jewish mu seum, not the [ind
ecipherable], it™s called -- has another name, 
some thing or other [indecipherable] in -- in Be
rl in it was behind the wall when the wall was still 
up. So -- 
Q: Does it -- is it still ther e, or
 were those items taken to the new Jewish museum in Berlin? 
A: No, it was at the old j -- at the old synag 
-- at the old synagogue, the alt [indecipherable] 
Q: The new synagogue? 

A: Not the new one. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Not the new one. It™s a combination of s
ynagogue and museum. If you want I™ll look up the 
name  of the mu -- museum late -- of the synagogu
e later. So, I contacted 
that particular museum 
and was in touch with Dr. Simon and told him that
 I am the sole survivor of my parents fa -- 
direct family, and I heard that the picture has 
been donated to the synagogue, or the museum, and 
I would like them to know that I 
am here, and I would like to have
 the picture returned. He was 
very, very evasive. Eventually I ma de an appoint
me nt with him to meet with him while we were 
on our trip to Europe last year when we me t Hors
t. And I made a date to meet him at the museum 
with Jutta. And I spent a whole 
hour with him. I said, look, I have
 sent you my birth certificate, 
which is from Halberstadt and you know that 
my  parents are Ernst, 
Marguerita Cohn, and you 
know that the picture was given to you by Horst™s 
sister. And he never deni
ed having the picture, 
but for almo st a year we have been talking back 
and forth. And he told me  then that the museum 

has never returned anything to anyone, because if
 they would return that pi ctur e, then other 
people would re -- want  their belongings back, to
o. I didn't see it in the museum because I think 
they had it in a cellar some where, it was not exhib
ited. We  tried very, very hard for him to give it 
up. Jutta would go over fr-from Halber
stadt and collect it, and there we
re all kinds of legal things 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
68 
 
 
back and forth. Eventually our son from Flor
ida contacted his senato
r, who contacted the 
American consulate in Berlin. And the American
 consulate in Berlin contacted Dr. Simon and 
said, why are you not returning this to Lillyan 
Rosenberg?  She is an imme diate he ir of that 
painting. Then he softened a little bit, he di
d not want to have problems with the Amer ican 
governme nt, because now the governme nt got in
volved. And a little while ago, approximately 
four weeks ago, he said it -- a yo -- to the ma n at
 the American consulate in Berlin that all Jutta 
has to do is ma ke an arrangeme nt with him and 
come  and pick it up. So Jutta has picked it up, it 
is now in Halberst adt and will be on view at
 the little museum of the Moses Mendelssohn 
academy for  awhile, and then we will ma ke a
rrangements to have it shipped to our home. 
Q: So -- and tell me  a little of the history. This is not some thing your mot her created. 
A: No, this -- no, this is not 
done by my mother, it™s just a pict
ure that I reme mber from my 
parent™s home . And the picture is not the pictur
e the way I reme mbered it, but you know, I was a 
child and it™s ma ny, ma ny years ago. But I do re
me mber the Hebrew, and the 10 commandments. 
So I am not sure that this is the picture that
 I was describing. But we 
decided my parents could 
have more than one picture which they have give
n away, and -- so we -- we d -- I don™t know for 
sure if that is the picture th
at I had in my mi nd. It is, howev
er, Moses and the 10 commandments. 
Q: And obviously, it sounds like it™s
 -- it™s important to you that it
 be on exhibit in -- in the 
museum in Halberstadt, right? 

A: Yes. And this way it gives some  publicity to
 the area. And the little museum is doing very 

well. It ™s getting tour ists fr om all over the world. 
And one of the things th
at  the little museum has 
been able to do -- for instance, when Jutta was 
here in New York about four weeks ago, and she 
stayed with us, she told me  that one of the pr
ofessors from a university here in New York, her 
fa mily is from Halberstadt, she thought she 
was alone in the world. 
Her back -- background, her 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
69 
 
 
fa mily name  was h -- Hirsch. Because there was 
Hirsch Kupva and Hirsch some thing else in 
Halberstadt. So when she got in touch with Ju
tta, Jutta told her, 
you know, you have a lot of 
me mbers of your fa mily in Israel, which she 
did not know. So this woma n by the name  of 
Hirsch, here in New York, did not know that sh
e had fa mily in Israel. They all me t again in 
Halberstadt. So the little muse
um there is getting people together from different parts of the 
world. And this year they invited grandch
ildren, that would have
 been like our age 
grandchildren, to come  there and write about gen
ealogy of their family. So they™re doing a lot of 
good things in this little town. 

Q: And so there were a number
 of survivors, ma ybe mostly 
children, but it sounds like there 
were survivors of Halberstadt. 

A: In different parts of the world, yes, and all ov
er. I mean, they are just  scattered. I believe the -- 
a fa mily from the Rabbi Owerbach, that family is 
in Israel. But of course
, I™ve lost contact with 
most people, but through a reuni
on in Halberstadt, or the ki
ndertransport reunion, people do find 
each other. 

Q: Okay, and let me  see if I have any other quest
ions to ask?  Did you keep this baby doll that™s 
name d after Horst? 

A: No, unfortunately I only have 
the picture of the doll called Horst. And one of the newspapers 
in Florida put the title, a doll called Horst, and 
had two full pages on the st
ory of the reunion with 
Horst and myself. 

Q: How doe s it feel, this me dia attention you™ve 
gotten here, and Germany, is it -- is it also a 
surprise, or -- or how has that been for you? 

A: I look at that as though my life, which I di
dn™t think was so -- so unusual, because when I 
have a -- neighbors here, and they say, oh you have
 such an interesting life, and I™d say where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
70 
 
 
were you from?  Brooklyn. I™d say, I wish I was 
born in Brooklyn. I don™t want such an 
interesting life. But now that it is
 the way it is, I would like it to 
be a contribution to history, so 
that no one will ever  doubt what has happened to children like myself. And on a positive vein, I 

would say that of all the peopl
e I know who have grown up under very difficult conditions and I 

s -- look at their family and their children, they 
have all done a very good j
ob with their sons and 
daughters, and most of them are professionals an
d doing very, very well. So I believe we™ve been 
able to teach them very good values.  

Q: Do you -- for yourself, would you say that -- that
 is a direct result of
 the way that you had 
your own childhood and the ha
rdships of your childhood? 

A: Yes, I believe so, even though I think children
 of kindertransport parent
s feel that they are 
overly protected. That is a complaint we get fr
om all the childr en. They will say my mother 
wants to know where I am, my father wants to k
now where I am, they™re always keeping tabs on 
us. That mi ght be some  of our insecurity of people like myself. But when I watch my children, 
who now ha ve teenage children, they™re doing the sa
me  thing with theirs -- children, they™re 
bringing them up the same  way, andI must say I™m glad about that. 
Q: Do you fi nd it difficult to remi nisce and to 
remember all these details about -- about your 
childhood? 

A: I would say yes, because it™s not a subject th
at I dwell upon at all, 
I look at the future. 
Although, we already pretty old, there prob -- I d
on™t know how much fut ure there is, but we 
look at it in a positive wa y. And the past seems to
 have its very emotional mo me nts. I know that 
when we spoke about the time I was told to l
eave the Allen™s house, how upsetting that was for 
me . I think that that was equally up
setting as leaving my parent™s home. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0510  
71 
 
 
Q: And has religion played a very
 important part in your
 life, in part because of -- of what you 
went through, would you say? 
A: I don -- I cannot really answer that with a 
yes or no ques -- statemen
t. I know that I feel 
absolutely Jewish, you could not change me . But I 
think we™re also very tolerant of all other 
religions. We have the two sons, one became very
 religious, and one ma rried a gi rl who became 
Jewish, as I told you. So we brought them up in 
a modest way, not in a kosher home, but they 
learned about their background by going to Hebrew
 school. They were Bar Mitzvahed, they had 
Jewish weddings. They keep a different kind of
 home , the one in Connecticut, Ralph and his 

wife, they have a kosher home . Steven and Susa
n and Miranda have the average kind of home  
like we have. But we do keep all holidays and we tr
y to get together as a family at least once a 
year and that is on Passover, so 
that we are at one table with bot
h sons. That was my request to 
both daughter-in-laws when they got ma rried. 

Q: We ll, I want to thank you very mu ch for agreei
ng to be interviewed, and 
just wanted to see if 
there was anything else you woul
d like to contribute or share 
before we end the interview. 
A: I think you have delved into my life quite deep
ly, and if I can be useful  to othe rs because of 
my past, then I will feel it™s my little contribu
tion to this world, apart from having a wonderful 
husband and two great sons. We ™ve ma de the best
 of every possible situation. And I thank you 
for the time you™ve spent with me . 

Q: Thank you very much. This concludes the
