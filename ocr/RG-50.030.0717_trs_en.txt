Question:  So this is a United States Holocau
st Memorial Museum interview with Harold 
Burson conducted by Mike Ab ramo witz on 
Novemb er 19th, 2013, at the Meyerhoff 
Theater at the Holocaust Museum in Washington,
 D.C. So welcome, Mr. Burson.  Nice to 
have you here.  
 
Answer:    Nice to be here.
 
Q: So you're from Memphis, Tennessee, correct?
 
A: Originally.  
 
Q: Okay .  
 
A: But I've been in New Yo rk since 1942.
 
Q: All right.  Well, tell us a little 
bit about growing up
 in Memphis.  
 
A: All right.  
 
Q: Tell us a little bit about your pare
nts and where you went to school.
 
A: My mother and father came to  the United 
States about a year before I was born, in 
1919.
 
Q: Where did they come from?
 
A: They came from Y o rksh ire, Leeds, England.
  So I grew up in the South, but I didn't 

grow up in a Southern household.
 
Q: I see.  And you went to
 public schools in Memphis?
 
A: I went to public schools in Memphis.  In fa
ct, I went to the same high school that Elvis 
 
Presley went to.
 
Q: Which high school was that?
 
A: Humes High School.  I was 13 years ahead of him.
 
Q: Did you ever meet Elvis Presley?
 
A: I never met him, b u t we are both
 in th e Humes High Hall of Fame.
 
Q: Congratulations.  And your
 parents, what did they  do?
 
A: My father had a hard ware store that went 
busted during the depression, and my  mo ther 
ended up supporting th e family by selling clot
hes doortodoor in  in black neighborhoods.
 

Q: Now, would you describe your growing up as
 being in a  being pa
rticularly poor, hard, 
or was it more middle class?  What wa
s  how would you describe growing up?
 
A: Well, I  I never went hungry, but my mother 
thought that people were
 rich if they paid 
the rent on time.  Now, money 
was always a problem.  I kne
w that I had to pay my  own 
way through college, and I gradua
ted from high school when  I was 15.
 
Q: That seems very unusual.  How did that
 happen?  You mu st have been precocious. 
 
A: That happened because my  father was an
 omnivorous reader, 
and according to my 
mother, he taught  started teaching me to read
 when I was three years 
old.  So I went to 
school when  I was six.  In those days scho
ols in Memphis did not have kindergarten, and 
so I started in the first grade 
when I was six.  I stayed in 
one room for about two days and 
someone came and took me to another room a
nd th at was the second grade, and I stayed 
there about a week and th en they took me to another room
 and that was the third grade.  
So I started school in th e third grade.
 
Q: Okay .  And how did you end up at Ole Miss?
 
A: I ended up at Ole Miss because I could pa
y my  way through sch
ool by writing fo r the 
Memphis Co mmercial Appeal, which 
was the big regional newspaper 
 
Q: Did they have a bureau in Jack  was it Jack son?
 
A: They have a bureau in Jackson, but I had 
nothing to do with th
at.  Commercial Appeal 
served not only Memphis, but west Te
nnessee, northern Mississippi, and eastern 
Arkansas.
 
Q: I see.  Were you the stringer for the paper?
 
A: I was a stringer for the paper at 14 cents a 
column  in ch.  I had been  a copy boy there 
for two summers, and the man who really gave me the idea of going to Ole Miss was 
what they called a tristate ed
itor, and he knew that I needed
 the money to go to school, 
and he said, "If you go to Ole Miss, you can have
 the stringer job."  And he said, "I'l l see 
that you get enough published to
 pay your way thro ugh school."
 
Q: What are the kinds of stories you wrote about?
 
A: You know, everything th at goes on on a co
llege campus.  There would be lecturers 
who would come on the campus, and I would write
 a stor y that said that so and so was 
going to  come and speak on such and such  a da
te, and then that wo uld be three or four 
weeks  or three or four months befo re he ca
me.  And th en the day before, I would say  do 
another little story and say he 
was going to be here tomorrow,
 and then I would do a story 
on what he said.  So I sort of
 wo rked out the system, and mo st of that stuff got published, 
but the  I guess the outstanding accomplishmen
t was I did an interview of Faulkner, and 

when Faulkner returned
 from Hollywood back 
to Oxford, I had the 
first interview with 
him, and it was  I was asked to do a rewrite 
for the AP  and also fo r the book section of 
the New York Herald Tribune.
 
Q: I see.  And how did you find Faulkner?
 
A: How did I get in touch with 
 
Q: How did you  what were 
your impressions of Faulkner?
 
A: Oh, my  impressions of him?  It was a co
ld winter day, and I went out to his home, 
which is called Rowan Oaks.  It is sort of
 a stately Southern mansion.  And he was 
writing when I got there, and he did all of his 
writing in a woodshed that had no heat in it, 
and he came back into the house and so rt of ru
bbing his hands, and he  he was  he seemed 
to me, he came across at the beginning as
 very shy, you know, like a deer in the 
headlights, and seemed ill at ea
se, but after maybe three or 
four minutes he loosened up 
and  I think one of the problems was with th
e interview, as I go back and look  read it 
from time to time, I really didn
't  know enough ab out wh at he 
had done as a writer.  I had 
not  I had read one of his books, so it is  it 
is not a really penetrating interview, but it  it 
did get a lot of attention, and 
 and the biggest news out of it 
was that he told me that he 
was going to  do this trilogy on Yoknapatawpha Co unty.
 
Q: It is amazing that for a 16yearold 
 
A: Well, I was  I was in about  th
at was my  junior year.  I was 18.
 
Q: 18.  Okay.
 
A: I was 18, yeah.
 
Q: So what did you study at Ole Miss?
 
A: I majore d in economics and 
English, had a double major.
 
Q: Okay .  And you continued to write
 for the paper all the way th rough?
 
A: All the way through.
 
Q: And then  I also read that you had been ap
pointed by the presidentof the university to 
run th e news bureau?
 
A: Run a college newspaper, which was 
 
Q: Tell us a little bit about that?
 
A: The  the man who preceded me got fired.  
I had been  at school for twoandahalf years, 
I was in the middle of my  junior year, and by
 that time I was regard
ed as probably the 
best news person on the campus.  At that 
time it was a v ery small school, it had 1600 

students, and  and I had this unique situa
tion where I knew the chancellor extremely well 
and he knew  me, and the news bureau office
 is a place w h ere they had correspondents 
from the Jackson newspapers, New Orleans Ti
mes/Picayune Herald  correspondent, and 
that was our place where they assigned us spa
ce.  And, also, there was an FDR new deal 
program called the National Youth Ad ministrati
on, wh ich was intended to get money in to 
the hands of college students, 
and so they  they had about 
five job allocations, and these 
people went around the campus and gathered
 news, and they woul
d put out what we 
called "hometowners."  Suzy  Brown got electe
d presiden t of a sorority, and they would 
write that paragraph, and th en an other pa
ragraph ab out what a great university the 
University of Mississi ppi was,
 and they would send th em out
, and the local papers in 
Mississippi would run them.
 
Q: I see.  S o  your job was to run the news bureau?
 
A: Yeah, run the news bureau.  And I was at that time 18 years old.
 
Q: I see.  S o  is that like the public 
relations department for the university?
 
A: That was a public relations part, and  
 
Q: And you work ed dir
ectly for the president?
 
A: Yeah, the chancellor
 
Q: The chancellor.  What was his name?
 
A: Butts, Butts.  Alfred B. Butts, 
Butts.  He ended up running th e 
 
Q: Can we pause for one minute.  
 
  (Interruptioninproceedings.) 
 
Q: So this is a continuati
on of a Holo caust Memo rial Mu
seum interview with Harold 
Burson. So, Mr. Burson, we just
 were talking about your tim
e at Ole Miss, and it sounded 
like you always wanted to be a writer, that th
at was something you were good at, and was 
that something that you wanted to 
 
A: That's  that's true.  And I 
wanted to come to New York   
 
Q: Okay .
 
A:  from the time I was 10 or 12 years old.
 
Q: Okay .  So  after you gradua
ted, you moved to New York ?
 
A: After I graduated, I went to work for th
e Commercial Appeal.  I was a reporter.  And I 
had this crazy notion that someone was going 
to discover me and take me to New York, 
and it happened six months later.  And the 
circumstances of it were that Congress had 

passed a selective service bill in
 August of 1940, and that set off a very large construction 
program, particularly so in the south/so uthwest, and I got the story that the war 
department was going to build a large shelllo
ading plant, ammunition plant, about 85 
miles from Memphis.  I met the contractor 
representatives early on, established a good 
relationship with them, and it was apparent 
from day one there was going to  be a major 
labor problem, and the problem was that a uni
on shop contractor was hired to build the 
biggest project that had ever happened in th
e state of Tennessee in a nonunion area, and 
they were going to have to 
negotiate some way that these 
nonunion people could wo rk at 
this  on this construction job.  And the head
 of the  the owner of the engineering and 
building company that built it, the company 
that had headquarters in New York and 
Cleveland, was a very farsighted individual, 
and he knew that this was going to be a 

major story because it was the first time in
 the war construction program that this 
situation had been  enco untered, and th is was goi
ng to  be the paradigm of projects of that 
kind, and he asked me if I could get a le
ave of absence from th
e paper to help him 
through this crisis they were going
 to have, and he asked me how  
 
  (Interruptioninproceedings.)
 
Q: So this is a continuation of a United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 

with Harold Burson.  So
 we were just talking very brie
fly about your move to New Yo rk 
to work for a construction firm.
 
A: An engineering/building firm, one of the larges
t in the country.  And after  I did go  he 
asked me a question, he said, "How mu ch do 
they pay you?"  And I said, "$25 a week."  
And he said, "Well, we will double that."  A
nd he said, "Do you have
 a car?"  And I said, 
"No, sir."  And he said, "Well, we will get 
you a car."  And I knew that at some point I 
was going to  get drafted, and also I knew in  
the back of my  mind this guy's offices were 
in New York, and if I played this right, I might
 be able to get myse
lf jumped up to New 
York.  And so the labor problem was settled 
in five or six weeks, and I was not doing 
anything, and his people knew  
senior people knew that I was sort of anxious and itchy, 

and they told him, and he called me and said
, "Sit tight until I come down."  And he came 
down , and he said, "We would lik
e for you to be a permanent part of our comp any."  And 
he was farsighted en ough to  know that the 
construction engineeri
ng field was going to 
have a lot of new competition because the 
war was going to make small companies big 
comp anies, and he said, "We are going to  have
 to pay more attention to public relations, 
marketing," so forth and so on, and he said, 
"Our people think that you might be good fo r 
that job," and 
 
Q: What was the name of that company?
 
A: The H.K. Ferguson Company.
 
Q: The H.K. Ferguson Company.
 

A: At that time it was one of the larges
t engineering/building companies, industrial 
build ing, and 
 
Q: Now, did you have any doubts about movi
ng from being a  from covering the news to 
representing the news makers?
 
A: No, I had no doubts, no problems.
 
Q: That's what you wanted to do?
 
A: Yeah.  Well, I  I figured it would make use 
 I've always considered that my basic skill 
is writing, and so I felt that I would, very fra
nkly, make mo re money if I did it as a public 
relations person than  as a news person.  I wasn't
 really very purist on
 that issue.  And he 
said, "The best way for you to learn our busine
ss is to travel with 
me for awhile," so I 
traveled with this man for two 
 
Q: He was the CEO of the company?
 
A: He was the owner of the company.
 
Q: Owner of the company.
 
A: For twoandahalf years, and based in New York , and we would travel for two weeks 
and I would be in New Yo rk for two week s, 
where I started automatically doing publicity 
for the company.  And I got 
to know the busine
ss press and the trade press extremely 
well.  I could  I had an unlimited expense accoun
t.  Of course, back then it didn't cost 

very mu ch  to take somebody to lunch or to
 dinner, and I would have
 a lunch date every 
day with some reporter or editor, and dinner 
with them, and so that continued until late 
1943.  I was getting automatic deferments becau
se this was an essential war contractor.  
And from the very beginning, I took th e positi
on I'm not going to  let the war end without 
my being in the Army, and so I told him to
ward the end of '43 that, "Don't apply for a 
deferment for me anymore because I'm going 
into the Army," and I called up my draft 

board , and they obliged  me by drafting me.
 
Q: And your draft board  was in Tennessee or in 
 
A: In Tennessee.
 
Q: Okay .  And so you got drafted in 1943?
 
A: End of '43.
 
Q: End of '43.  And  
 
A: And I went into an engineer  they 
put me into an engineer comb at group.
 
Q: Okay .  And wh at did you do 
for the engineer comb at group?
 

A: I was sort of in operations.  We were 
doing bridging, road repair work , demining, 
taking mines out of everything.
 
Q: Were you based in  the Un ited 
States or did you go to  Europe?
 
A: No, I was  was in one week  or two weeks,
 rather, after I finished basic training, I was 
put on a boat in Boston and went
 to Europe.  I went to  first we landed in England.  I was 
in No rmandy ab out eight weeks after the i
nvasion, and we pulled mines out of the 
hedgerows.
 
Q: I see.  S o  you went in 
after  after the DDay invasion?
 
A: Yeah, uhhuh.  No  well, 
I went into Normandy after 
DDay, yeah , but I had basic 
training at Camp  McCoy, Wisconsin.
 
Q: And so your assignment when
 you got to Europe was demining?
 
A: That was the first.
 
Q: What are some of the ot
her kinds of th
ings you did?
 
A: Bridge construction/repa
ir, road repair, supporting.
 
Q: All right.  So I'm curious since we are goi
ng to talk about Nure
mb erg, did you  had 
you heard of the Nazi atrocities?  Had th
e GIs  had many of yo
ur colleagues had any 
sense of what the Nazis had been 
up to behind  behind the lines?
 
A: I  you know, I was aware of the concentra
tion camps when   wh en I was in Europe or 
even  even probab
ly before I went to Europe, but I ha
d no idea of the magnitude of them.
 
Q: So you jo ined  an
 outfit called the Ar
med Forces Network?
 
A: American Forces Network.
 
Q: American Forces Network? 
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And when did th at happen?
 
A: That happened right after 
the war in Europe was over.
 
Q: So that was like in th
e second half of 1945?
 
A: Well, in May.
 
Q: In May.
 
A: May 1945.  
 

Q: And were you sent to Nu remb erg at that point? 
 
A: No, no, no.
 
Q: What were some of the storie
s that you worked on?  First of
 all, actually  excuse me.  
Let me backtrack for a second.  Tell us about the American Fo rces Network?
 
A: American Fo rces Network was arguably the 
best radio network that ever existed, and 
the reason for that is that not 
only did they  have some of 
the best Hollywood producers, 
directors and so forth, and also some very ex
perienced news people, but we were able  we 
got all of the programming from the four Amer
ican networks.  There were four radio 
networks back then, and ou
r Sunday night lineup would 
have Jack Benny, Jimmy  
Durante, Bob Hope; wh ereas, the other networks
 back  in the States, they had one of them 
on each.  And, also, we had a repertoire theat
er that had such people in it as M arlene 
Dietrich, Mickey Rooney, Celeste Holm, w
ho would co me visit us when they  were 
between assignments for USO, things like that. 
 It was a very professional operation.  It 
had 63 stations 
in Europe, and 
 
Q: And where were you based wh
en you were working for them?
 
A: Well, when I started, I started in Paris, 
which was also one of the great attractions at 
that time.  Americans we
re loved back then , and 
 
Q: And what were some of your assignments?
 
A: Well, I  I didn 't cover anything until Nure
mberg.  I did  we di
d news shows, 15minute 
news on, you know, 12, three, six, nine, an
d fiveminute summaries at
 the start of every 
hour, and I was on th e rewrite desk to update those news shows.
 
Q: I see.  S o  you were a writer for the news shows?
 
A: Yeah, that's right.
 
Q: Did you ever  
 
A: No, I never did 
 
Q:  appear on line?
 
A: No, my voice was not a radio voice, and al
so I had more of a Southern accent than I 
do now.
 
Q: Okay.  So you were writing for the news shows  
 
A: Yup.
 
Q:  based in Paris?
 

A: Yeah.  And  and one day around th e 1st 
of November, I got a message from  to go up 
and see the colonel who was running th e AFN, 
and he said, "We are going to  really do a 
first rate jo b of covering the Nuremberg trial,
 and I want you to take on th e assignment."  
And  and there were two I think basic reasons
 why I got the job.  One was that I came 
into the Army late, so I knew 
that I was going to be there 
for about a year after the war 
was over, so  and the people who had been 
at AFN were leaving 
because they had a 
number of points to go home.  And the Army 
did a great job of de
mobilizing the troops, 
and you knew almo st at the 
end of World War II in Europe
 when  you were going home, 
and you could figure it within a week almo st, 
and so I knew it was going to be in May of 
'46 that I was going to come home, and I ta
lked to my  commanding officer about it, and 
he was an old AP guy, and he
 got me appointments at Stars 
and Stripes, Yank, and AFN, 
and AFN offered me a job, so I moved from 
Germany down  to Paris and stayed there 
four or five months.
 
Q: So you were in Germany 
with the engineering corp s?
 
A: Yeah, yeah.
 
Q: Moved to Paris to work for AFN?
 
A: Yeah.  And  and as I 
say, I just did updates on 
 
Q: What was it like living 
in Europe at that time?
 
A: It depended on wher
e in Euro pe you were.
 
Q: For you.
 
A: For me, it was  you know, Europe  if you were
 in  I spent  mo st of my  time was in  we 
were holed  up in  an area on the border wh
ere Germany, Belgiu
m and Holland come 
together.  And Atkinson 
does a great job of talking about
 that battle, which was one of 
the decisive battles of the war.  And so  the 
people lived fairly we
ll.  You know, they 
didn't  have any  there seemed to be enough fo
od.  You know, the area that we were in had 
not been devastated at all.  We were base
d in Holland, actually, 
about two miles from the 
front, and, you know, it was  you 
 about  we were in front of the artillery, and so you had 
to get used to the sound of 
shells going over your head  ev
ery night, but the people, you 
know, learned to live, you kn
ow, without recreational stu
ff, without amusements.  You 
know, people hadn't had any new clothes for five 
or six years, so  but the wo rst part of it 
was when   on living things was watchi
ng how the people in Nuremb erg lived .
 
Q: Right.  So you were assigned to cover th
e trial in the fall of 1945, and you moved to 
Nuremberg?
 
A: Yeah.
 

Q: And, again, your job was writing 
scripts for the correspondents, right?
 
A: No, a script that would be delivered
 just like an evening news show here.
 
Q: I see.
 
A: Yeah.  
 
Q: I see.  
 
A: But it was only on one subject.
 
Q: Right, only on one subject.  So did you  
did you attend all the proceedings at the time 
you were there?
 
A: I attended all the  every proceeding fo r five  for five months.
 
Q: That mu st have been  an amazing experience. 
 
A: It was.
 
Q: Did you have a sense of the 
history wh en you were doing it?
 
A: Oh, yeah, uhhuh
.  Yeah, yeah.
 
Q: And tell us a little bit about ho
w you wanted to cover the tria
l?  Did you  did they give 
you any direction of wh at th
ey wanted or did you have 
a lot of leeway on your own?
 
A:   Well, the direction I got was we want a 
straightforward account of what went on in 
the courtroom.  And your audien ces, you have
 two prin cipal audiences.  One were the 
million or so American soldiers who were s
till in Europe; the othe
r was Englishspeaking 
Germans.  And one of the re
asons for that was that th
ere were surveys of where 
people  Germans got their news and credib
ility were done, and the American Forces 
Network was the mo st credible news source 
in Germany for several years after the war, 
and the reason for it is, is the Germans felt th
at the Americans would not lie to their own 
troops.
 
Q: So th is is really  you had a rea
lly good audience for your broadcasts?
 
A: Yeah.  Oh, 
yeah.  Yeah.
 
Q: And did you wo rk  can you 
tell us anything about the correspondents you wo rked   or 
not the co rrespondents, but did you wo rk w
ith anyone in particular for colleagues?
 
A: Well, I  yeah, Howard K. Smith an
d I got to be very  close friends, and 
 
Q: Was he covering this for CBS?
 
A: CBS.
 

Q: He mu st have been  a young reporter then?
 
A: Yeah.  Well, he was  Howard was in his la
te thirties then, probab
ly 37, 38.  He and I 
would swap things.  You know, we weren 't 
competitive.  And he became one of my 
closest friends for the rest of his life.
 
Q: I think  did William Shirer ever cover the trial  
 
A: Shirer  Shirer never covered th e trial, no.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: No, huhuh.
 
Q: Okay .  So it was Howard K. Smith.  
Were there any other household names of 
reporters who covered the trial?
 
A: Well, Walter Cronkite was with United Press,
 and he was  they had a fourperson news 
team there, and he was the mo
st junior of four people. 
 And when  I saw him on TV, I 
couldn't  I just couldn't recogni
ze him because he was sort of 
a mousy kind of a guy wh en 
he was at Nuremb erg, and, you know,  but 
he came a cross with su
ch great confidence 
and  and so he  I remained friends with him until he died.
 
Q: Do you reme mb er talking to  him at the time?
 
A: Oh, yeah, yeah.  We weren 't 
really close.  I got to know
 him more after the war than 
before.
 
Q: But Howard K. Smith was one of your closest 
 
A: Yeah, Ho ward  K. Smith I would say was one of my  closest friends.
 
Q: And by the way, wh ere were you in  the 
courtroom every day?  Where was the press 
gallery?
 
A: Well, they had a balcony that sort of ov
erhung the co urtroom, and the balcony is here, 
and the ju ry  I mean, and th e defendants were down right below us.
 
Q: So you saw the back  of their heads?
 
A: No, no, I saw the front.  I 
 
Q: So they were facing you?
 
A: Facing us.  And I'd say  suspect I was 
not more than 30 feet away from Goering.  
Goering was on the end of the bench and 
 
Q: So which  wh ich of the Nazis were you pa
rticularly interested in?  I me an, obviously  
they are all fascinating in a terri
ble way, but who did you focus on?
 

A: Well, of course, Goering.  They  there 
 
Q: Well, tell us about Goering a little bit.
 
A: Well, Goering, you know, had  the Amer
ican press, you know, during the war  you 
know, after he didn't w in the Battle of Brita
in, he  his Air Force 
did nothing 
in DDay, 
so  he, you know, was the anoi
nted successor to Hitler from al
most the start of the party 
until those events, and he lost Hitler's favor, a
nd he started on narco
tics, got fat, and he 
was sort of portrayed in the American press 
as a buffoon.  He, you know, actually  you 
know, he won th e equivalent of the Medal of
 Honor twice in World War II  World War I, 
and fairly well educated, and 
 and, you know, was one of 
the members of that 20 group 
who was mo re upper middle class than mo st 
of the people there, and he had this 
commanding, almost charismatic
, personality that you knew 
who the most powerful guy 
in that room was.
 
Q: By the way he carried himself?
 
A: By the way he carried himself.  And, 
you know, he  he sort of dominated the 
courtroom.  Everybody looked at him, you 
know, wh en  something happened.  But  and 
he was extremely articulate, very credible.  
He  he wanted   his big objective was to 
protect his honor as a soldier, and  and he 
was on record as sayi
ng he knew he was going 
to get executed, but he wanted
 a soldier's death, and th at meant a firing squad, and th ey 
weren't about to do that, and so he obviousl
y arranged to do otherwis
e, took this arsenic 
tablet before he 
 
Q: Were there other  any of the other defe
ndan ts  did any of the other defendants, you 
know, stick out in your mind at the time?
 
A: Yes, but not very positively.  Most of th
em were  well, practically all of them were 
depressed; particularly the m
ilitary people.  Schacht, who was a finance minister and who 

was one of the three people acquitted, he was 
upbeat most of the time; obviously a very 
bright guy.  I'd sa
y about half of them, you know, yo
u would think was a plumber or 
something like that, you know, read wate
r meters. Of course, you know, Streicher 
was  you know, he was sort of the scum of th
e earth not only to the 
 to the people in the 
courtroom, but also to his fellow defendants.
  They  the military 
people, you know  I 
think, you know, acted like they
  they were order takers, th
ey weren't going to ch allenge 
anybody, they were interested in
 their military careers.  They 
 of course, Hess was sort of, 
you know, the light comedy touc
h, you know, sort of like crazy like a fox, you know, and 
he would carry on with little 
antics every now and then.
 
Q: Were you  did th ey come
 across as mass murderers?
 
A: No.  No.  There  there were a couple 
of them, like a guy named Sauckel, who ran a 
labor force, and Kaltenbrunner, were 
like thugs.  You know, he  he did 

not  they   probably the mo st elegant of the 
people there was Speer, who was the architect.  
He was going to  rebuild Germany.  And, y
ou know, he has been probably  the my stery 
person of the whole thing becau
se he came from a welltodo family, and he was just like a 
28 or nine year old arch itect, 
and Hitler took a liking to him, 
and eventually he headed  up 
all the industry manufacturing groups, but he  
a lot of  since, you know, the last 30, 40 
years, there have been several books on  very
 critical of him that he
 should not have got 
in bed with Hitler.  It was 
totally out of his character and his family and so forth.
 
Q: You know, the other great character in th
e news room  in the courtroom was Judge 
Jackson.
 
A: Justice Jackson.
 
Q: Justice Jackson.  Do you
 reme mb er the opening statement  the fourhour opening 
statement 
 
A: Oh, yeah.  I thought he did a magnificent
 job.  Jackson I think made a mistake in 
doing th e crossexamination of Go
ering, and in my script I 
don't treat him too kindly.  
And I remember the morning af
ter, Tom Dodd, who was Jackson's chief of staff, later 
became senator from Connecticut, I just happe
ned to pass him going into the courtroom, 
and he said, "You were pretty 
rough on the chief last night." 
 And I said to him, "Didn't 
you think he deserved it?"  An
d he just  but what happened
 was  what Jackson's problem 
was, that he didn't know enough of the histor
y, and he would ask a 
question, and Goerin g 
would usually find something wr
ong with  his question, he got some of the facts mixed 
up, and, you know, he 
did not do well.  He di
d well in  I wasn't there, but I read his 
testimony  I read  his closing sp eech wa
s a good sp eech, he did very well, and I 
understand he wrote mo st of the stuff hims
elf, but  but Jackson himself, you know, was 
the architect of the whole show.  He was the 
one who really pushed it in the direction that 
it went.
 
Q: Did  did you ever have an opportunity as 
a reporter to meet privately with any of the 
prosecutors, you know, for a briefing for them 
to explain what you were going to see or 
was your only interaction seeing what
 happened in th e courtroom itself?
 
A: Mainly what happ
ened in the courtroom, because, ag
ain, Jackson did not encourage 
his staff to talk to the mediA:
 
Q: Did any of the other prosecutors?
 
A: I  I don't know what happened , you kn
ow, with the French 
or the British.   
 
Q: But you had en ough material ha
ppening right in front of you? 
 

A: Oh, yeah, right, yeah.  It was  it was 
happening, you know, 
and almo st every day 
I'd  there were very few days when I had 
trouble figuring out wh at am I going to  lead 
with.
 
Q: It was interesting reading a few of your scripts how detailed they were.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: These were  these were not just wire serv ice stories.
 
A: No.
 
Q: You had a lot of detail about wh at was happening.
 
A: Yeah.  And I  I took copious notes, a
nd I  when  I got the assignment, you know, I 
started reading about  I went over to the International Herald Tribun
e _______, and I just 
went back to the thirties, some of the big 
events that happened, 
like Kristallnacht, and 
some of the earlier reporting on concen trati
on camps, and so , you know, I  I tried to 
prepare myself as much as possible.
 
Q: All right.  Now, did you  
were you su rprised by the extent of the Nazi deprav ity?  
Because you mentioned you had sort of a ge
neral sense o f what had happened, but the 
details were quite astonishing.
 
A: Yeah.  Well, they  you know
, the  the first time that the 
pictures of the concentration 
camps were shown was Nuremb erg, and, y
ou know, it was horrend
ous, you know, and 
the whole courtroom, you know, y
ou could just hear the gasps, you know, and it really  it 
was really the magnitude.  You know, we knew 
they did these things. 
The  the other point 
that  about the trial itself
 and the fairness of it, the Germans convicted themselves 
because of their documentation.
  And I'll give you an example of that.  When Goering 
was being questioned by Maxwe
llFife, MaxwellFife said, "What is the first duty of a 
prisoner of war?"  And Goering said, "To es
cape." And th e Luftwaffe, Goering had had 
responsib ility for running th e prison camps for a
ll captured Air Force people.  They didn't  
go in to the general Army  pool 
of prisoners of war.  They we
re in they called them Luft 
stalags.  And Goering said, "To escape."  A
nd he said  pulled out a document, and he 
said, "Do you know  have you ev
er visited this Luft Stalag," whatever the name of it was, 
and Goering said he was there once or twice.
  And he said, "Hav e you ev er heard the 
names," and he read four Eng
lish pilots; and Goering said, "N
o, I never heard of them."  
He said, "Well, were you aware that they tr
ied to escape and were captured and brought 
back?"  And Goering said, "I d
on't know anything about that." 
 And he said then they like 
three months later escaped again, and they
 were brought back, and he said, "Would it 
surprise you if I told you that they were 
executed?"  And Goerin
g said  and he said, 
"What would you have done if 
you knew th at?"  And he said
, "I would have reprimanded 
those who were responsible for doing it."  And 
he pulls out this letter, and it is asking for 

permission to execute them, and Go ering not onl
y says "okay," or th
e equivalent, but he 
says, "This will show the others what will 
happen to them if 
they try to escape." 
 
Q: You watched this in the courtroom as it unfolded?
 
A: Yeah.  And Goering was just 
crestfallen.  That's the only tim
e that he really was  just 
didn't  know what to say.
 
Q: Did you recall at all being struck by the So
viet judge or the Soviet prosecutors?  Do 
you recall what kind of
 role they played?
 
A: Very neutral.  They  you 
know, they were there along just
 for the ride, and they  you 
know, I don't think they took it 
really seriously.  The  the most
 I got in contact with, at the 
castle where we stayed, they ha
d converted one of the rooms in
to a very nice little bar, 
and in th e evenings it was  the bar was pre
tty well full, and there was one Russian who 
was a jolly sort of a guy, didn't speak any 
English at all, but he was fascinated by th e 
different kinds of glasses that different 
drinks came in, and 
so he would line up 
everything from Cointreau to 
Tom Collins practically, like si
x or eight glasses, ten 
glasses.  And Russians, you know
, didn't have any mo ney, and 
drinks were like 20 cents, 
so the Americans, you know, would toss mo ney 
into th e pot, and he 
would drink all these 
drinks, and he did 
it night after night.
 
Q: This is one of the prosecutors?
 
A: No, no, no.  This wa
s one of the news men.
 
Q: One of the news men.
 
A: One of the news men.  Yeah, one of the 
news men, yeah, yeah. 
 But, you know, most 
of them couldn't  speak English.  There were
 a couple of them who could, but they were 
very circumspect.
 
Q: Put yourself back at this 
time.  Did you feel like you we
re watching a process that was 
fair, that seemed like  you know, it may not 
have been perfect just
ice, but that rough 
justice was being done at the time?  
What was your feeling at the time?
 
A: It was as close as you could come when 
the winner tries the loser.  And one of the 
questions that we asked Jackson was, "Why 
do you say that they ar
e being given a fair 
trial?"  And he went into  great detail and 
says, you know, "We let 
them choose their own 
lawyers, and so if they want
ed a Nazi for a lawyer, we a
pproved that.  We paid the 
lawyers.  We gave them a place to work and 
fitted it out for them.  We gave them copies 
of all the documents before we introduced 
them."  You know, they
 did whatever they 
possibly could.  And, also, the  the judge  Ju
dge  they could object, and a lot of times the 
objections were sustained.  So  I think it ca me as close as you could get to, you know, 

AngloSaxon type justice.  And the other th
ing about it that I think speaks in favor of 

what  of a fair trial is there was a good d
eal of variation in the sentences.  You know, 
there was 11, I think, of the 20 
 
Q: And some were acquitted, too?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: And some were acquitted, too?
 
A: Three were acquitted.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: Three were acquitted.  One 
of them should never have b een tried, Fritzsche, who was 
Goebbels'  he was like the four
th  ranked guy under Go ebbels, 
but  but there was  none of 
the rest of them were left, so he  he got it.
  And so  they  and the ju dges, you know, saw 
that, you know, he was not really part of th
e group, so  he was onl
y about 38 years old, 
too, I think.
 
Q: Tell us, by th e way, speaking of media 
people, Streicher was 
obviously  convicted and 
later hung.
 
A: Hung, yeah.
 
Q: What were your impressions of Stre
icher?  He comes across as a thug. 
 
A: Oh, a slob.  You know, just an uncouth individual.
 
Q: But did it seem to you th at he was on trial,
 too, even  though he was, you know, a  you 
know, a publisher, he wasn't actually a part of the Nazi apparatus?
 
A: You know, he had very little power, prac
tically no power, as far as running the 
country is concerned, but  but I think  I thi
nk it was great symbolism 
to  to include him, 
because he was so, you know  
you know, back duri
ng that period there was hardly a week 
or two or three weeks that you didn't read 
about Streicher in the American press as to 
remarks that he had made or things th
at he had done, antiSemitic stuff, you know.
 
Q: So he was really co
nditioning the public for 
 
A: Yeah, yeah.  And so I  I would assume 
that Streicher was there more for public 
relations purposes than the fact that he was 
one of the perp etrators of starting the war or 
even wh at he did during th
e war, you know.  He  but 
 
Q: Do you  were you at all 
censored by your  by your bosse
s or did they let you pretty 
much write what you want?
 
A: You know, as I've gotten older, the greatest 
surprise that I think as I've thought over 
this thing, and particularly 
the way the info rmation policy of
 the Army is now, is that 

literally no one read my  script before it went 
on the air.  I read it, 
and I showed it to my 
announcer, and ev ery now and th en they woul
d say, you know, you 
are tangling me up in 
the stuff and could I make the changes, but 
 and  and no  I never 
got a negative comment 
from any of my chain of command.  In fact
, the only time I ever heard from them was 
when I got the Jackson thing.
 
Q: When  you really kind of ex
plained how Jackson had messed up?
 
A: No, no, no, no.  When  when  
we got the interview.  It was a 
 
Q: Oh, you had a oneonone in
terview with Justice Jackson?
 
A: Oh, yeah.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
 
Q: I did not know th at.
 
A: Yeah.  And where a guy that was at 
 
Q: Tell us about that a little bit.
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: Tell us about that interview.
 
A: Well, Jackson at the beginning made a statem
ent that he didn't want to make a circus 
out of this, and that he didn't
 want any second guessing on ea
ch day's testimony, so he, in 
effect, you know, admonish ed hi
s own staff, and he said he
 would give no in terviews 
until the trial was over.  I knew his press secr
etary  or got to know him, Gordon Dean, 
and I said  you know, I tried 
to get through that, and he said, "No, the boss doesn't want 
to do it.  He is afraid if he does somethin
g with you, that will br
eak the line."  And one 
night I got th e idea that the approach should  be 
that he owes it to the 
soldiers who are still 
there to tell them what he is trying to do, 
and I told  called my   went up to  see my friend 
and told  him, and  and he went and told J
ackson what my argument was, and he says, you 
know, they are talking about people who foug
ht this war who some of them, many of 
them injured, all of them lost friends, a
nd th en Jackson agreed, but he wanted  the 
questions submitted in 
advance.  And he di
d not change  and he didn't change the 
questions either.  He 
 
Q: Do you recall the most  
do you recall any of the mo st 
interesting comments he made 
that stuck with you?
 

A: Well, I guess the mo st quotable thing wa
s that, "These people are being tried not 
because they lost the war, but 
because they started the war."
  And it was  the interview 
was mo re scholarly than sensational.
 
Q: But was it the only interview that
 Jackson gave during the trial?
 
A: Yeah, uhhuh.
 
Q: That was a big scoop then. 
 
A: Yeah.  Oh, y
eah.  Yeah, AP 
 
Q: Did it get picked up by 
 
A: AP picked it up, and my  hometown  newspa
per pick ed  it up, and, you know, said, you 
know, "Memphian Harold
 Burson," you know. 
 
Q: It was a radio interview, not a  
 
A: A radio interview.
 
Q: Not a written interview?
 
A: Yeah, radio, yeah.
 
Q: We are going to  try to wrap up pretty quickly.
 
A: No, I have time.  I have a 5:00 plane.
 
Q: Okay .  Let me ask you a couple other qu
estions about Nuremb erg befo re I move on.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: At the time of the trial, did you feel that 
th is was a break through in legal affairs, that 
this was something that was goi
ng to really deter future 
 
A: I, like a lot of other people, was fairly na
ive about this, and, you
 know, the world was 
hungry for someone to assure 
them that there are not goi
ng to be any wars like this 
anymore, and, of course, you 
know, that was Roosevelt's 
line, you know, in getting the 
United Nations off the ground, and one of
 the things that Nocera pointed out 
 
Q: This is Joe Nocera?
 
A: Joe Nocera, yeah.
 
Q: He interviewed you years later?
 
A: Yeah.  Well, two years ago.
 
Q: Yeah, two years ago.
 

A: And that's  why  what brought 
 
Q: Yeah, this brought this all in play.
 
A:  this interest up, huh?  Otherwise, it was 
still sitting on a shelf.  
Jo e said that  I guess 
the way he put it is that there was a refresh
ing naivety and th at reflected world  the 
sentiments of a lot of people in my scripts 
is one of the reasons he did the article, and 
the  but, you know, in ta
lking to reporters, I didn't  find much cynicism.
 
Q: So people thought this 
would be a huge advance in 
 
A: Well, let me put it this way.  Among th
e British and the Americans, that's the only 
ones that could communicate with the media, I 
didn't find mu ch cy nicism in the thing, in  
the feelings about the trial.
 
Q: All right.  So people felt it was fair?
 
A: Yeah, yeah, people felt it wa
s fair.  Well, a lot of people
 felt it w as more fair than it 
should be.
 
Q: Right.  And people felt th
at it was going to  stop fu ture 
dictators or people who wanted  
to commit genocide?
 
A: Yeah, that  that  that Kosovo wouldn't 
happen, you know, or Rw
anda wouldn't happen.  
And, you know, you'v e got to remember th
is was part of a buildup for the United 
Nations.
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: And so  but  but I  I think the trial was as
 fair as it could be wh en  the winning nation 
won, and I don't think 
any other co untry would have gone 
as far as the United States did.
 
Q: Let me just think of one or two other ques
tions.  One thing about your reports is that 
they are really written in a very
 plain way, not a lot of highfa
lutin language.  It felt to me 
you were almost trying to talk to the GI.
 
A: That's w h at I  that was my audience.
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: That was my audience.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And I was, you know, close enough to 
them to  to be able to do that.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And the  you know, I've often 
wondered if I could do it again.
 

Q: Now, did you  were you disappointed to  leave the trial midway?
 
A: Huh?
 
Q: Were you disappointed to
 leave the trial midway?
 
A: No.
 
Q: You were happy to  go home?
 
A: I was happy to go.  I wanted to get on with my  life.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I wanted 
 
Q: And tell us just briefly  so 
you missed the final judgment  
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q:  and th e end of the story?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Okay .  And if you could, because we just
 have a minute left, just tell us a little bit 
about  this could be a threehour discussion,
 but just tell us a little bit about how you 
founded your  you know, did th is play
 any role in your future life or  
 
A: Well, 
 
Q:  or did you ju st kind of just put it away  
 
A: Well, Nuremb erg didn't play a piece of it. 
 What happened  the 
reason my life turned 
out the way it did is my boss at the construc
tion co mp any died wh en 
I was in the service.
 
Q: I see.
 
A: I did not want to go back 
to the company as an employee.
  I was wellconnected with 
the management of the comp any, and the grea
t my stery that I have not been ab le to 
explain fu lly is, you know, wh en  I was trav
eling with Mr. Ferguson, I was 21, two and 
three, and I was his gatekeeper.  I contro lled hi
s schedule to a large ex
tent.  I  I received 
his mail.  And the fact that I 
 
(End of videotape, inte
rruption in Proceedings.) 
 
Q: Okay.  This is a continuation of the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Harold
 Burson. Mr. Burson, you just we
re talking a little bit about your 
life after the war.
 

A: Yeah, right.  Well, yeah, I  when he was trav
eling, I  all the stuff came to me first, and 
the fact that I didn't piss off a lot of people is
 so remarkable to me th
at I  you know, I just 
can't explain it, but  in fact, you know, I had 
a lot of people who would  you know, were 
happy that I was there so that 
I could, you know, expedite what they wanted to  do, and it 
was just a very unique relationship.
 
Q: So you didn't  want to go ba
ck  just to being an employee?
 
A: Yeah, that's right.
 
Q: Does that mean you wanted to start your own firm?
 
A: So what I did literal ly the 
day the war was over, May 8th, 1945, I wrote a let ter to the 
then head  of the comp any and said, "I just 
don't feel like coming back as an employee, 
but I do want to maintain a relatio nship with
 th e comp any, and I want to start my  own 
public relations firm when 
I get back, and I want Fergus
on Company to be my first 
client."  And about three weeks later, 
in a crayon he wrote, "We'll d o  it."
 
Q: So that was your first client?
 
A: That was my first client.
 
Q: So when you got ba
ck to the stateside  
 
A: Actually, I stayed home for a couple months
 in Memphis, and then I came up here to 
New York, and I was in business, and I go
t another client, a former employee of 
Ferguson with another comp any,
 and he gave me  
Ferguson paid me 750 a month, and the 
other one paid me 500 and gave me office sp
ace, which was pretty
 good for, you know, 
twice  25 at the time, and  a
nd up until 1953, '52, I had five
 people working for me.  And 
BursonMarsteller started because a friend of 
min e fro m New Yo rk  T imes call e d  me an d  
said, "There is this guy Marsteller from Chi
cago who has got an ad
vertising agency and 
wants to hire a PR firm for a client, and I'
ve recommended you."  And I called Marsteller, 
and it was  the company was Rockwell, and 
Al Rockwell had bought
 a helicopter, and it 
was going to  be the first helicopter used for 
corporate executive travel, and he thought it 
should have been 
on the cover of Life magazine, so I got the assignment.  It never made 
the cover of Life for the helicopter, but  
the helicopter got delayed because of the 
Vietnam War  no, I mean the Korean War.  A
nd I suggested that he let me work on a new 
home wo rkshop power tool that they had deve
loped, an d I got him three pages in Life 
Thanksgiving issue, a $289 item, and they  ha
d to go into double shift to satisfy the 
demand, and they became my  first r
eally big client.  They paid me 
 
Q: So th at's  when  you decided to  go 
into business with 
Mr. Marsteller?  
 

A: Marsteller, yeah.  Well, a
nd then he got me another clie
nt, and I thought this was so 
good that we should get togeth
er, and 30 years later we became 
the largest PR firm in the 
world.
 
Q: Well, that's for another time.  L et me ju
st ask you one final que
stion.  Wh at did you 
learn from having witnessed and havi
ng co vered the Nuremb erg trials?
 
A: That's a good question.  
Well, the one thing it did, it gave me a lo t of confidence.  
Here I was covering this thing, they  and 
part of my audience wa
s arguably 200 of the 
most competent correspond
ents in the world, and they appe
ared to be  to treat me as a 
peer.
 
Q: But did it tell you anything eith
er about human nature, or the nature of evil, or some of 
the big questions?
 
A: Oh.  Well, I  you know, I guess it taught  I 
came out of it feeling I didn't  realize that 
human beings could be as depraved
 as they are.  I didn't come out of it with an up  upbeat 
as far as the situation was concerned, but it  
I think it really gave me a lot of confidence, 
as like when I started my  busin
