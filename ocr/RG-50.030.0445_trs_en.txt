" What  are  you laughi ng mis t er? "  I

i mpos ing and I tol d hi m the st ory.  And he sai d, 
" Why do you s end that  wo

clear he r mi nd and tell her what is wh
at and why is why.  This  is not 
a sic k ness , thi s is what you ar e  
bor n wi th, period.  And there 's no
 question about it."  I said my 
friend was ver y, how shall I s ay, 
bac kward, you know, he  ne ver...  
So  I said, "Doctor, wo uld you do
 me  a  big fa vor? "  "Certai nly, 
what is it?"  "Send a letter to that
 woma n and just  te

and I woul d be  ve ry, ve ry happy a n d a ppr eciat e  it 
no end."   " No questi on a bout it , t o morr ow t he 
letter goes out."  So the next Fr
iday evening we ca me to Emil's( ph)
 pare nt s for dinner and she ca me  
in.  She di dn't speak t o 
hi m, she spoke right a way
 to me, " What did you do

do?"  " Well," she says, "I got a lett
er."  I  sai d, " A nd does that  clear 
up your mind?  
Does t hat make 
you fe eling better? "  "It 's unbelie
vable what you did and why you di

 Emil so muc h  and he was  so depr

out  once and for  all and t hat 's wh

l d a nd he se nt you t h e lette r a nd 
that shoul d clear your mind, peri od
."   So his mot her sai d, " W hen Ro
l f tol d you what he just tol d  
you, isn't t ha t  enough for  
you?   Don't  you have  to go on? "  "I ha

we  were , how shall I  sa y, 
not very frie ndl y all  t he ti
me , you know, til  we l e ft. 
Q: I ha ve a questi on bec a use you st
art ed to tell us t hat s he propose d

well known.  So that made
 her, I t hink, she had t he idea that he
 coul d do somet hing 
about it.  But he,  
s mart ma n a s he  was , t ol d her ri ght
 a wa y, this  is  not a si cknes s, t h
ere  ca n be not hing done  about  it, 
this i s s o me thing that you're bor n wit h, peri od. 
 And t hat 's  why he wr ote her t he letter on my  
account .  But she was stil l not  100 
per cent satisfied, but I  di dn't car
