In 1951 Kurt was drafted inthe U.S.Arm y. He was severely injured during artillery 
training and was hospitalized for a lengthy period. After hisdischarge in Novem ber of 1953, 

Kurt attended the University of  Pennsyl vania'sW hartonSchool of Business, graduating with

Services. Although Kurt
 
was intervie wed about his Holocaustexperience by the Steven

W ith that I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our First Person,Kurt Pauly.

[Applause] 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Hello,Kurt. Kurt, thank you so muchfor joining ustoday and being wil ling to 
notonly be our
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
today but being wi lling to do thisfor yourf irst tim e. So thank you.
 
>> K u r t  P
auly:
 
I'm very pleased to do it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W eare honoredtohave you.Wehave a very large c rowd, so this is terrif ic.
 
You have som uch to share with us. 
 
 
Adolph Hitler cam etopower when you were j ust 6 years of age when you left 
Germ any with yo
ur
 
parents in 1936. Before you turn to your parents' decisionto leave 
Germ any and what that meantf or youand yourf am ily, tell us what you can about yourf am ily 

andtheir lives prior to Hitler and the Nazi Party taking control of Germany. 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
W
ell,both of m y parents livedfor quite som etim e inGerm any, m y m other in the 
Aachen area,m y father in the southern partsof  Germ any, Bavaria. Andhis fatherhada sm all 

hotel in auniversity town. T hen when hem arried m y m other, he went to his new f athe
r-
in
-
l a w' s  
business which was a butcher. He tried to expand thatbusiness.T his was shortly bef ore the 

Nazis cam e in.And then when the Nazis cam e in, they forcedhim to close someof  the 

businesses andeventually he thought it was best to leave.
 
>> B ill B
enson:
 
Beforewe go there, Kurt, a coupleof  other thingsf oryou to share with us. 
W hen did yourf ather become a chef? 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,he becam e a chef  actually before the FirstW orldW ar. He was in the First 

 
3
 
W orldW ar. Sincehe cam ef rom  Bavaria andhe was a cook,a chef,he was assigned to the 
s t af f  of  th e  
k
i n g 
of  B
avaria. Atthat time therewas still a king of Bavaria. He was on the staff 
thereas a cook. I suppose that was better than being onf ront lines.He saidat least they were 

never hungry.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell usa little bit before yourm other.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
My m other'sf am ily, of course
, 
lived in theAachenarea for a long tim e. Had 
m any relatives there, including the one you just ref erred to. Mrs.
 
Frank'sm aiden nam e was 
Ho ll
a
nder. And 
they had also lived in Aachenfor quite som e time. Itwas a sm all Jewish 
comm unity, so the people were ver y close. Even second cousins were pretty close.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Speaking of  second cousins,how large of anextendedfam ily did you have? 
 
>> K u r t  P a u
l y:
 
I  re a lly
 
--
 
I don't know. M y m other had three siblings.My m other was a twin. Her 
twin sister died inoneof  thef lu epidem ics af ter the FirstW orldW ar. The older sisterm arried 

and was also living in the Aachen area.She had a brother,m y Uncle Alf red, whose son, m y 

f irs t  c ou s in ,  is  st ill livin g in  I s ra e l.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 O k.  
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Theyf led Germ any right afterKristallnacht when m yuncle was arrested and put 
in jail. The way he got out of  jail was that youcould show that you were going to leave the 

country. This was when the policy of  theGerm an governm ent was just to get the Jews out of  

Germ any. T his was before
 
--
 
later,of  course,they ran into the problem  of thef inal solution.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ouldyou say, Kurt, that in the time bef ore Hitler cam eto power that your 
fam ily enjoyed a relatively comf ortable lif e?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Yes. Yes. Yes. They were integrated well into Germ an society.T heyfelt very 
m uch athom e. Although there were always s om e elem ents of anti
-
Sem itism  underlying, you
 
know, but they were not so disturbing andnot as violentas what happened later when Hitler 

cam e to power.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And once Hitler did come to power, soon after that your parentsm ade a huge 
decisionto leave Germany. W hat can you tell us about those circumstances that com pelled 

them  to want to leave? 
 

>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,my f ather was, as I saidbef ore, was in the FirstW orldW ar, was very 
m uch concerned about where to go. He came to the conclusion that it was not enough to leave 

Germ any, that we
 
hadto leave Europe. As he said inam ore colorf ul language, we have togo 
across the waters.
 
Hehadanolderbrother who had come to the states bef orethe FirstW orld 
W ar. My father had visitedhim  several tim esaf ter the FirstW orldW ar, beforehe was m
arried.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In the United States?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Yes. He lived in New York, actually. And he hada butcher store in Manhattan. 
But sometime between
 
--
 
so m yf ather hadbeen exposed to the United States. He thought it 
was a place hem ightwant to go if he hadto leave Germ any. Unfortunately som etim e between 

last seeing his brother and the time Hitler cam e intopower, UncleMax had died. Som y 

parents had no other contacts in the UnitedStates.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothat option was closed.
 
>> K u r t  P a
u l y:
 
Yes. Fortunately m y m other had relatives in Palestine. They had been Zionists. 
Had nothing to do with Adolph Hitler.T hey had gonethere before Hitler ever cam etopower. 

Shehad two sets of aunts anduncles, a handful of  cousins there. And they infor
med my 
parents of anagreement thathad beennegotiated by the Jewish agency in Palestine with the 

British and with the Germ an governmentstoallow Germ an Jews to em igrate to Palestine 

under moref avorableconditions than if they went otherplacesat that 
time .
 

 
4
 
 
At the ageof  6, of course, I knew nothing about that.I learnedabout that, actually
,  
in  
m oredetail when I becam e a volunteer here in the museum. And inoneof our history courses 
the volunteers took,one of the historians was talking tom eona break and askedm ehow I got 

here andI explained it to him  andhe said, 
ﬁO
h, you went under theagreem ent.
ﬂ 
So  tha t's 
when I researchedthat.
 
 
Actually, about10,000Germ an Jews got toPalestine under thatagreement.What 
happened was there was a lot of ob
jections f rom  the Arab population in the area about all of  

these Jews com ing in.And theBritish cut off the imm igration.
 
One of theother benef its was 
you would actually becom e a citizen of Palestine after two years under this agreem ent. Since 

the Jews had losttheircitizenship in Germ any, that seemed to be a plus, of at least you would 

belong som eplace.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And itwi ll turn out later
 
--
 
you wil l talk m ore aboutthat.
 
 
Kurt, a coupleof  things about your period in your early years bef oreyou went to 
Palestine. Do youhave memories of that time living in Germ any before you lef t?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Yes, I have som e. Of  course,when we started
 
--
 
whenm y f ather started to think 
about leaving and then when hedecided to go
 
--
 
that he would go to Palestine, he tried to 
convince many other m em bers of ourfam ily to em igrate also because hef elt it was getting 

m oredangerous inGerm any. However, they were not really preparedf or it yet.They didn't 

think it would be so bad. Many of  them  wereoptim isticthat
 
Hitler would,perhaps, be voted out 
again or whatever.
 
 
T he older people
 
--
 
m y father's mother was li ving andm y m other'sf ather, so those 
were m y t wo li ving grandparents when I was born, theyf elt they wer e too old todothat and 

perhaps they m ight join us later once we gotacclim ated to a new country. Butat thattim e they 

said, well, we're old and retired, what are they going to do tous
.  
Little didthey know. Nobody 
suspectedanything like that. I'm  sure.
 
 
So the only other person
 
--
 
we ll,  a c t u a lly t wo
 
m em bers of ourfam ily ended up in 
Palestine. One was this cousinW alter who had precededus by about a year orera andahalf  

in Palestine. He was more like an uncle to me becausehe was somuch older. I was 6 years 

old. He was getting ready to get married. As you saw in the picture,he was anadult. 
 
 
And thenm y m other'sbrother, m y Uncle Alf red, who was a teacher in Germ any, was 
arrestedduring Kristallnacht and ended up injail. T he only wa y thathe would get out was if he 

could show thatthey would leave Germany. That I was ver y com m on thing thatthe Nazis did 

a t tha t tim e .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Imprison you andthen say ifwe let you out, youhave to leave the country.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
That's right. And m y aunt, hiswif e, started wondering where they could go. She 
had some relatives inPalestine as wellf romherf am ily's side. Andwhat they did was they went 

to the British consulate in their areaand just convinced them  to give them visitor visas to go to 

Palestine. Andthese visas were goodf or
 
--
 
I don't rem
ember exactly but it was less than a 
year period.
 
But they got to Palestine as visitors. 
 
 
And then when the visa started expiring andthe British started looking for them to 
have them  leave, they had gone into hiding. And the British couldn'tfind them. And then the 

war broke outand they were in Palestine. And that's what saved them .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
K u rt ,
 
you hada nanny in Germ any. Can you tell usa little about her?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Yes, yes. But m y wif e as you
 
--
 
I m ean, m y mother, as you noted, was also
 
in  
thebusiness. And,of  course, she was busy during the day. Shehired a young wom an to look 

af ter m e.
 

 
5
 
 
One tim e we were invit ed back to Germ any, to the Aachen area.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
1996 I think?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Yes.W e were invited by the Historical S
o ci
ety of Eilendorf .W e went there.And 
they hadf oundm y nanny. She was still in thearea.W ehad a reunion. Im ean, I hardly 
rem em bered her that well.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Righ t .
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Because I was so young then. But she rem emberedm e very well and act
u ally 
gave m e som epictures that we didn'thave of ourf am ily that shehad.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And she also shared with you som e things about what happened to thefam ily. 
Righ t ?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Ye s .  Ye s .  Ye s .
 
 
Anyway, we ended up
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
On the nann
y, when you went back in 1996, shetold you about seeing the 
brown shirts. Tell us about that.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,of course,m y m other was notas anxious to leave as m y father atf irstbut 
when oneof thebrown shirts appeared outside the store in Eilendorf, discouraging people 

f rom buying f rom  a Jewish store, shedecided thatm aybe things were really getting wors e than 

she hadthought. And it convincedher to go along with m y f ather's plans of leaving Germ any.
 
 
His experience of theFirst W orldW ar was 
t
hat he saw theGermanArm y
 
occupying 
the surrounding countries very quickl y. Although the FirstW orldW ar the Dutchhad beenable 

tom aintain independence and were not pulled into the war. Butm y father was concerned that 

another war m ight break out and if
 
you wentto oneof  these surrounding countries, you would 
f ind yourself  under Nazi domination again.
 
 
And this is what happened, of  course
, 
tomany people, including theFranks, Anne 
Frank's parents who went to Hollandfor just
 
that reason
, d
idn't consider that, didn't come to 
the same conclusion as m y father.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforeyou leftf or Palestine, you started school.W hat do you remember about 
your school experience?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,that was af unny thing. Although we already had ourpapers a
nd  
ever ything hadbeen arrangedf orthe trip to Palestine, the law was at the age of 6 youhad to 

go into school.
 
At thattim e, if I'm not m istaken, the school year started af ter Easter. So when 
I  
--
 
so in March, when I becam e 6,I had to goto school. Fortunately there was a Jewish school 
in Aachen. So I didn't have to go to a public school whereas someof  the children at that tim e, 

Jewish children were already beginning to have problem s. But Ihad to take thetrolley into 

Aachen to go to the school f rom Eilendorf . And m yf ather was sometim es concerned. You 

know, a little boy
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
On the trolley.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
On thetrolley all the way to Aachen. Although nothing ever happened,but he 
was ver y concerned. And he would som etim es follow the trolley ona bicycle to make sure that 

ever ything went sm oothly.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hy do you think he didn't ride the trolley with you as opposed tof ollowing you 
on the bike?
 

>> Kurt Pauly:
 
I think because he didn't want tof rightenm e, I suppose, partly.
 
 
So
 
I wentto that school. I didn't rem em ber the school. I had some pictures inmy 
m indaboutthat school. I rem em berthef irst day, I walked into the classroom and there was a 

picture on theboard that som eone had drawn in colored chalk of a little boy com ing to school 

 
6
 
on his f irst day.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yo u  r em em be r  t h at .
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
I rem em berthat. Ialso rem em berthat the urinals were in the courtyard outside. 
And if  it was raining and you had to go to oneof  the urinals, you'd get wet.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>>
 
Kurt Pauly:
 
I got wet several tim es. [Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Kurt, even
 
--
 
although you were just 6 when you lef tGerm any for Palestine, 
you recall leaving and that it was diff icultf or you.T ellus what you can about leaving and 
saying goodbye to your
 
fam ily m em bersand then going to Palestine.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,once we haddecidedand adate was set
 
--
 
m y f raternal grandmother
 
--
 
paternal grandm otherwas not in the Aachenarea, so we had to gotoW urzberg, where she 

was still li ving. And the picture you saw bef ore,m e in front of thef ountain, was taken on one of 

those trips. She lived on the square.And in the center of the squarewas the fountain.T hat's 

where that was taken.
 
 
As I said before, neither she nor m y grandf ather, m y m other'sfather, f
e lt
 
--
 
would go 
with us at that tim e. And, of course, what happened was they were caught up in the war.W e 

know what happened to them . T hey were both caught up in Jews sent to
 
T heresienstadt
. 
M y 
grandm otherdiedthere, according to the records. My grandfat
he r  w a s  s e nt  on  t o 
Mauthausen, 
oneof  the killing cam ps and of  course was killed on arrival.W e know that happened.
 
 
And thenm y m other'selder sister, Rose, who had three children, two girls and aboy 
who was aboutm y age, the youngest
 
--
 
we found nothing
 
in the records of  what happenedto 
them .T hose records were perhapsdestroyed.W ho knows? 
 

 
T he Germ ans were ver y good at recordkeeping. T here was nothing found on them. 
Except this tripthat we tooktoEilendorf  I justdiscussed before,the local histori
ca l so cie t y 
invited us, when we got hom e we received a letterf rom Germany and it was f rom a wom an 

who wrote tous that she had been af riend of m y cousinIlsa, whowas the oldest girl in my 

aunt'sfam ily. And they had beenat school together. And she want
ed
 
--
 
she thought perhaps I 
would like a picture of her. Shehad a classpicture which includedmy cousin. And she sent 

thattous. And she said when the Jews were segregated, these two girls, who were ver y cl ose 

apparently, would clandestinely m eet in apublic park and they would seta datef or thenext 

m eeting.T hat way they kept in touch. And she saidone time, the last time that they had set a 

m eeting, she went tothe park andm y cousin never showed up. And shenever knew what 

happened to her. Probably,
 
of  course, they were picked up in someaktion.
 
To this day we 
don't know anything that happened to them  specif ically.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Kurt, yourf am ily, before they left Germ any f orPalestine, sold thefam ily 
butcher businessandsold it, I think, to your
 
father or grandf ather's apprentice.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Yes.W ell, they soldthe business in Eilendorf . Because it was in the housethat 
they owned.T he othershops were rented. By thattim e there was nothing else to sell. It was 

sold to the apprentice. 
 
 
W hen
 
we returned to thathom e,many years later,m y cousin, whowas the son of 
m y m other'sf ather, Uncle Alf red, was in Germ any with the Israeli Foreign Service. T hat was 

his career. He ended up in the Israeli ForeignService. Andat thattim e Germany was stil
l s p lit  
between eastand west and the tem porary capitalf or west Germ any was Bonn, which was not 

toofarf rom  Aachen. And that's where he was.W e got together
 o
n one of ourf irst trips to 
Europe after the war. Weactually m adearrangem ents to go to thathouse. It was a bitof  an 

experience.
 

 
7
 
 
Jill was along with us on that trip, of  course.W eled Jill
 
--
 
we thoughtm aybe it would 
be easier when we knocked if  there was a wom an there to talkto,tothepeople who were 
living in m y house who were descendants of
 
this apprentice.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So the sam e f am ily in the house. 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
The a
p
prentice was not living anym ore,of  course.But hisdaughter and her 
husband were living in the house and the son, their son, was running thebutcher business.
 
W e knoc
ked on the door and Jill explained who we were. T hey invit ed us in. Jill always says, 
when she starts to speak tothe wom an, thewom an replied
 
--
 
said it was like a recording that 
she had in herm ind as to what to do if  this ever happened. Because she just
 
seemed to let it 
all come out, thehistory that she knew about. And we spent some tim e with thatfam ily.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And they were able to tell you things about you andyour f am ily.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Yes. They told us something about what happened to our
 
grandfather. T hey 
said when Mr.
 
Herz, yo u know
 
--
 
they tookthe old people andputthem  in whathad beenan 
o ld
-
aged homefor Jewish citizens in the city of Aachen. And he was sent there. Unf ortunately, 
of  course, they didn't get very suff icientf oodwhen
 
the war brokeout and she said heused to 
com e the back way and they would gi ve him foodbecause, of  course, they felt sorry, which  

was a great risk on their part as well. Because if  they hadbeen spotted, they could have gotten 

into considerable trouble.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That must have been very powerf ulf or you to be there.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
It wa s.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Having this man whohad been a child who now live d in what hadbeen your 
fam ily's home telling you what happened to your grandf ather.
 
>> K u r t  P a u
l y:
 
Yes, yes. It was very disturbing, of course.W hen we left
 
the house, all of us 
were quite disturbed.
 
 
I had rem em bered the house somewhat.I had som e 
m em ories of  a bedroom and 
looking outthe window. There was a gardennext door which I could look into.W hen we went 

to the house, I saw that gardenas well.
 
And then when we got back, af ter we had gone to the 
house and were talking with this f am ily, the m an turned to m e and said
 
--
 
he said,I saw you 
when you came to thekitchen
 
--
 
you saw what change we m ade there. And the story there is, 
oneof m y earliestm em ories was of m y running in thehouse andthe kitchen was sunken.It 

was a sunken kitchen.It was down a stepf rom  the rest of the house. And 
I 
fell down that step. 
I was a little boy andfell flat on m yf ace. And I bled like a stuck pig, as they say. And when I 

walked through the kitchen, it wasn't sunken. 
 
 
I mu st ha ve
 
--
 
I rem ember thinking
 
--
 
I sa id , W
here did that m em ory com e f rom ? 
Somehow I rem em bered. And he saidhe saw m e react. He said, ﬁY
ou 
saw what we did in the 
kitchen.W e evened out thef loor.
ﬂ 
So it was the right kitchen
 a
s it turned out.
 
 
But we lef t very disturbed, all three of us, when we left thathouse.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Kurt, tell us about going to Palestine. First, how did you get there? And what 
wa s  it  lik e ?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
For a 6
-
year
-
old, it was ver y e xciting.W e were going to go on abig ship. And, 
of  course, we had all of these tripsback tomy f ather's mother several times. Andm y father still 

tried to get them, convince them  to
 
go ,  bu t  no su cce ss.
 
 
Finally it was tim e to leave. It was summ er tim e, aboutm iddle of the year, when we 
left.W e sailedf rom  Franceona ship to Haif a.W eended up living in  Haifafor a tim e.
 
 
My f ather also
 
--
 
besides m y mother's relatives, I said there
 
was m y cousinW alter. 
And that's how he got into thetrucking business. He hadbeen in com munication with his 

 
8
 
nephew,W alter, and said, you know, 
W
hat can Ido in Palestine?W e'renot going to have 
enough money toopen a restaurant. AndW alter said, 
w
e ll,
 
we couldgo into the trucking 
business because this is a burgeoning econom y andm aybe we can m ake a living on that.
 
Som y f ather senta truck
 
--
 
boughta truckand had it sentto Palestine. You could do this 
under this agreem ent.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You could
 
buy a truck in Germ any.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
You could buy things in Germany and ship them . Even as late as when Jill's 
fam ily left Germ any, which was m uch later, Jews could still buy things if  they hadfunds, stove, 
som e, and ship them  to where they were going
.  
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soused a German truck to start his trucking business.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Right. And I can remember going on thattruck. Sometim es whenI wasn't in 
schoolor vacation tim e or whatever and they went out.They sometim es tookme along.
 
A  lo t of 
their businesswas sof tdrinks.T hey would transport sof tdrinksf rom Haif a to 

surrounding areas.I would getone of those drinks. [Laughter] I can rem ember that.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Despite starting the truckingbusiness, it wasn't enough businessf orthem to
 
do italone. Right? 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell, it turnedout that it wasn't quite enough to support two f am ilies. Andthen 
m y f atherthoughtm aybe he should leave Palestine. My f ather was notanardent Zionist.He 

hadnothing against Zionists. Andhe was very happy to be in Palestine and not in Germ any at 

thattim e. But he saw that it was getting very different. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
He tried other things as well, right? T o earn a living. He took
 
--
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell, yes, but it was not suff icient.W hathappened was, in thetim e that we 
were in Palestine, another brother ofm y f ather's, m y Uncle Theodore, got to the United States 

through his wife'sf amily. M y Aunt Julia'sbrother had com e to the UnitedStates long before the 

war, as a very, ver y young man,had gone into business andmarried. He marrieda wom an 

also of Germ an extraction.Their parents, whom  I still m et, were quite elderly at the tim e,had 

com e to Cincinnati as little childrenf rom  Germ any. And they were li ving in the UnitedStates. 

Now, these people
 
were not Jewish but they, of  course
 
--
 
but this was fam ily for them. Notus 
but thethree sisters.This m an hadthree sisters and he thought it was time to get them  out of  

Germ any andbroughtthem  in.And thesepeople were then willing t o sponsor us as we
ll.  T h e y 

were very nice people.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sponsor you com ing into the United States.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforewe talk further about that, just a couple of other questionsabout your 
tim e in Palestine.
 
Youwent to school.W hat was it
 
like f or younow in the school? 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell, initially, of  course,I didn't understand a word of Hebrew. So I was a little 
concerned. My m otheralwa ys told me I'd come hom e crying f rom  school, complaining," I don't 

even understand theteacher."  But at that ageyou learn languages very quickl y.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W as language a problem  foryour parents in Palestine?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Yes, yes it was. T hey were m uch older, of  course.T hey were notf luent in 
m odern Hebrew. So Iguess I was really theonly one who spoke itver y well, with m y cousin 

W a lt e r .
 
 
Inf act, we were in touch with his children. Asa little aside, somehow I think m y 
fam ily andW alter lostcontactf or some tim e.I don't know what happened. I was too young, I 

guess to know about it. Butthere must have been some kind of littleconf lict andthey were sort 

of  separated.Oh,I was already a volunteer at the museum . I gota phone callf rom  the 

 
9
 
m u s eum
 s
om ebody is inquiring aboutm e.
 
W hat happened was, the children, thetwo sons, 
were tr ying to
 
do a genealogy on theirfather's fam ily.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W alter's son?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W alter's fam ily,W alter's sons.I didn't know them .W e hadn'tm etW alter
 
--
 
we  
hadm etW alter, Jill and I, buthedidn't talk to us muchaboutthat and we didn'tm eet hi
s son s.  
So som ething had happened there.
 
 
Anyway, I got the call from  them useum  som eone isasking whetherwe know about 
you. Andnow what happened was, them useum hasa lotof  things that we had contributed, 
including a lot of pictures of  whathappened to
 
ourfam ily. And they were in the archives, 
including the picture that you showed aboutm y parents' wedding. T hey were looking f or 

Paulys. And with com puters today they ended upon them useum 's site.T hey put inPauly.And 

pictures cam e up, including thep
i c t u re
 
--
 
andthey said, well, it was Aachen. You know, their 
father cam ef rom  southern Germ any, asm y fatherdid.Thought it must be the wrong Paulys. 

Sof ora long tim ethey didn't call. But they couldn'tm ake no other contacts.T hey couldn'tf ind 

anybod
y else. So they decided to call. Andthey called the museum , of  course. Becauseour 

name andnum bers isnot on the site. Andthe museum  calledus and we said, well, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That's us.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
That'sus. It's ok to give outour number.And one day I get aphone call andthis 
is m y co u sin
 
--
 
he explains who he is. He's now li vin g in Calif ornia.Oneof  them  is living in  
Calif ornia.T he other is livin g in Israel. And this is how we contacted
 
--
 
just recently we got 
another comm unication
 
--
 
>
> Bill Benson:
 
Yesterday.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
From this cousin. Yes.Sothey had com e to our house to gather information for 
the genealogy, visited us som e years agonow. So at least there's som e contact. And,of  

course, I'm  in contact with m y cousin that I talked about before, Uncle Alf red's son.W ehave 

been in touchf ora long tim e. In f act,his lastvisit was this spring. He came to visit us again 

when they go to Europe, he andhis wif e go to Europe, and he decidedto come early. He visits 

h is co u sin
 
--
 
he has another cousinhere f rom his mother's side.Sohe has visited usm any 
tim es.And we have vis ited him  inIsrael.W ewere in touch.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell usabout com ing to the UnitedStates.So yourfathernow has Ithink 
another brother in the United States who is willing to sponsor you.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell, these Am ericans
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
TheAm erican side.Sothey're will ing to sponsor you.T his is 1938. So thewar 
has not yet happenedor started. And you cam eunder not a German quota, undera 

Palest
inian quota. Am I right about that?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,I don't know which quota we cam e under, really. ButI do know that on the 
pictures
 
--
 
Im ean,onour naturalization papers where it says previo us nationality it's 
Palestinian.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Because
 
as you said, you lost injure Germ an citizenship, went to Palestine.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
And we recovered that Germ an citizenship, later. But that's another matter.I 
really don't know the details. I was too youngto be interested. Andnow it's a little late. I
 
gue s s  
I could research that and find out.ButI didn'thave the urge todo it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So your parents makea second big decision tom ove to yetanother continent, 
com e tothe United States.What was that like for you to pick up stakes and move? 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,acouple of things. Firstof  all, we talked aboutm y f ather wasn't making 
toom uchm oney. He had enoughmoneyf or two tickets.
 

 
10
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
T wo
 t icke t s? 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
T wo tickets acrossthe Atlantic. He didn't really want to ask thesepeople, if he 
could avoid it
,  
to payf or our tickets as well. T hey were already doingquite a bit.T hen they 
rem em bered,m y parents rem em bered, when they came to Palestine, they had gone to som e 
cooperative that said they could geta jobf orm y f ather.
 
But they had tom ake a small paym ent 
to them, to the coop
,  
for them  to do that.W ell, it turned out that they never got any jobfor my 
father andm y parentssaid maybe we'll get thatm oney back that would help us. So they went 

to the officesof  the coop, who were not atall receptive topaying them themoney back. 
 
 
So what to do? My m other cam ebackthenext day and she was cryi ng to get the 
m oney back andtheystill wouldn't do it.W ell, she came day af terday. And they just got alittle 

t ire d  of t h is  la
dy com ing in and crying in theiroff icesand they ga ve her them oney back and 
now we had enoughfor three tickets.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you could come.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,I don't know who they wo uld have left.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
But we cam e. I rem ember thetrip ver y well. I was 8 years old. Almost9, infact. 
W ecame in the wintertim e, Decem ber.W e wentby shipf rom  Haif ato Marseille, the reverse of  

what we had doneearlier, crossed Franceby train, had to spend afew days in Paris waiting 

f o r t
he shipto come.The ship was the Queen Mary. T hat was a big shipf oran8
-
year
-
old.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Infact, once the war began, it becam e a troop transport ship.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
And now it's a hotel in Long Beach, Calif ornia. And one of m y business trips 
to 
Calif ornia I said, I'm  going to stay at theQueen Mary hotel. It was close toLong Beach.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you remembered that trip?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Oh ,I rem em be r. A sa  littl
eboy, I ran through that ship. Ihad a wonderful tim e. 
My parents were ver y
 se a sick
. It was December. Andeven on theQueen Mary, ooh, it was 
really rocking. [Laughter] But I didn't get 
se a si ck
. I remember that ship ver y well.
 
 
So I'm  walking down to the room s in thehotelwith the bellm an
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In Long Beach?
 
>> K u r
t Pauly:
 
In Long Beach, a young m an. And he turns
 
--
 
and the f irst class cabins arethe 
hotel room s. Andhe says to me, 
ﬁH
ave you ever stayed with us before?
ﬂ 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
And I said, 
ﬁW
e ll,
ﬂ 
I sa id, 
ﬁ
I was on this ship one of the times when it was 
crossing the Atlantic.
ﬂ 
Andhe looked at me like I was Julius Caesar, ancienthistory
, 
I didn't 
know anybody was ali ve.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
He was just speechlessafter that. Hetook me to this very lo vely cabin.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Probab
ly not the cabin you came over in.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Not at all. I was ver y im pressed by the cabin. Ita wonderf ulbathtub. You could 
get sea water orf resh water depending on what kind of bath you wanted.T hat was quitea 

memory. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You shared with m e earlier thef irst time you ever had a Brussel sprout I think.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Ye s, tha t's righ t.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But you got to the United States, stayed in New York  City a short period, and 
then went to Cincinnati.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Very short, justa
 
f ew days. And then we took the train to Cincinnati.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ha
twas it like to adjust toyet
 
another country, culture, language?
 

 
11
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell, you saw m e in class in thef irst picture we saw. Of course I spokeno 
English. I always tell people I'm an expert infirst grade education becauseI've been tof irst 
grade in three countries with three different languages.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
At diff erent ages. [Laughter]
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Different ages. Andhere I arrive in December. By thetim e school st
arts again it 
was reall y January. The teacherdidn't speakHebrew or English
 
--
 
I m ean Hebrew or German. 
Andfortunately in the class there was a lilt boy who cam ef rom  
--
 
a  little  bo y, little f irst gra d e r, 
who cam ef rom ahome that also spoke Germ an, which in Cincinnati it's not thatunusual 

because they have a long history of  Germ anim m igration. He spokeGerm an. He was m y 

translator. I very quickl y learned English.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Then you got to getout of the f irst grade.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Ye s. B y th e tim e
 
the year was over, I was in second grade, still one grade 
behind but I caughtup with that eventually.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How diff icult was itf or your parents to re
-
establish them selves and earn a 
liv in g?  
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,  itwa s  d if f ic u lt . T h e  
e c ono m i c
 
conditi
ons in the states at this time 
were 
deteriorating a littlebit and Depression cam ealong quickly. M y f ather tried to get a job and 

f inally got a job ina large caf eteria operation,not cooking but justpreparing vegetables.But it 

was a job. You know, he gotpaid something, so he took it.And he said the job had one great 

advantage,healways hada seatfor him self on the trolley going hom e becausehe sm elled so 

of  onionsnobody would sit next to him . 
 
 
Oneday he was walki ng to this jobagain, and suddenly hehears avoice calling his 
name," Hugo." Im ean, here we are, strangers in paradise, in Cincinnati, and he hears 

som ebody calling him . He turnsaround.And this is am an when he studied to be a cook, 

studied his trade, he had gone to Switzer land
 
to study his trade and this manhad been in the 
sam e group learning this tradeas he was.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In Swit zerland.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
And hewas now a chef  in one of  the large hotels in Cincinnati. He saw m y 
father. So m yf ather explained, you know, all his problem s to this gentleman. He said, "And 

you're doing what?" Preparing vegetables. He says that'sterrible. He says, ﬁMeetm e in the 

Union Hall next week.
ﬂ  
They m adea date. He said, 
ﬁ
I'll see that youget a job.
ﬂ 
And he did.And 
m y f ather got a job
 
asa cook very quickl y. 
 
 
T he restaurant happened to be two Jewish brothers.It was a businessm an's 
restaurant, sort of .They ver y quickl y recogni zed histalents. And cooking is not theonly 

im portantthing when you're inthe restaurantbusiness. If  you'rea chef , order is thefood, you 

know. T hat's very im portant.If  you order toom uchf ood, you know, you'll go broke, possibly, or 

at least you're not going to m akem uch prof it.Andm y father was ver y good at that,ordering. 

He knew hisf ield.And he very quickl y became the chef  in the restaurant. 
 
 
As late as
 
--
 
Oh, before we left
 
--
 
well, he went out of that businessand started a 
bakery with ano
ther f riend, som eone he 
knew, who was a baker. And, of  course,he knew how 
to bake,m y father. In thosedays when you became a chef, you notonly had to cook, youhad 

to learn about baking as well. T hen when he retiredf rom  that, we m oved.W hen I graduated 

f rom high school, that's when we m oved to New Jersey.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
During thattim e, bef ore the war began in
 
September
 
1939,had your parents 
been able to be in touch with fam ily m em bers in Germany either in Palestine or in the United 

States? 
 

 
12
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,Palestine, yes. Of  course m y mother's brother. I don't know about W alter 
but I guess they had som e contact.T here was some comm unication with Germany until the 
war started.W e were there in Decem berof 1938. Next year, 1939, the war doesn't start until 

September
 
1 when Hitler invades Poland. Sothere was com munication. 
 
 
My f atherand his brother, Theodore, comm unicated with thefam ily. Of course they 
would have been allowed to get outbutthis tim ethings were really going from  bad to worse 

but there was som e com munication.And then, of  course,that stopped when the war started. 

W ith Palestine it was another matter. My m other's brother was there and they were saf enow in 

the war becausenobody was going to send them back.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But asfar as comm unication with thef am ily in Germany, as of Septem ber
 
1 , 
1939
 
--
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
P re tty m u ch p
et e r e d 
out.T here was still som e comm unication through the Red 
Cross and soforth and so on, but we didn't know what happened tothefam ily which was ve ry 

disturbing tom y parents.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hendid you learn? 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell, whenthe war was over, you know, they beganto lookf or people. It turned 
out
 
--
 
of course, we learned about m y grandfather andm y grandm other very quickly because 
there were records. And m y mother's brother, Uncle Alf red, had gotten informationout of those 

records about what had happened, which I explained to youbefore.
 
 
My m other's sister, who I talkedaboutm y oldest cousin andthis wom an who 
informed us about
 
herexperiences with m y cousin
 
Ilsa. My parentshoped against hope that 
som ebody, m aybe theoldest girl, would
 
have s
urvi ved but wef oundnothing about them . And, 
of  course, we f ound nothing
 
--
 
later we had som e comm unication with a second cousin of 
m ine. Herf atherhad beena cousin ofm y m other.T hey survi ved. T he father did not survive , 

but they hadf led to Belgium . 
 
 
And they had thisonegirl, Mar got, and she was hidden in a convent during the 
SecondW orldW ar and that's how she survi ved. Andherm other cam ebackaf terthe war to 

pick her upf rom  school. Of course, now she had grown up in the convent and here com es t
h is  
wom an who is
 
her 
m other and she was ver y unhappy about leaving the conventatf irst.But 
eventually that workeditself out and they came tothe United States.I was in fact, in contact 

with them .And herhusband, who was also asurvi vor, died very young. He was my bestman 

at our wedding. Butthere was ver y little contact.
 
 
T here was another cousin of m y m other's who had beenanopera singer. She 
turned up one day with  us. Cincinnati didn'thave an operahouse,opera company, but in the 

summ er they had what they calledthe Summer Opera. And singerswould come in the 

summ er and she wassinging. She was in the choir.And she looked usupand foundus,a 

distant cousin of m y mother's.
 
 
Otherwise, we f ound really close relatives
 
--
 
nothing, really.
 
>> B ill B
enson:
 
W hatdo you know
 
--
 
I know yourf atherdied relatively earl y.W hat was the 
im pact on your parents when thef ull realization of  whathad happened tofamily
 
--
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
It was very heartbreaking for them, on both sides,my f ather'sf am ily andmy
 
m other'sf am ily. T his is probably a pretty comm on experience.
 
 
Most of m y parents'f riends in Cincinnati were also refugeesand had comehere. So 
it was not uncom mon in the comm unity m y parents lived in that these things happenedaf ter 

the war. People wouldtry to f ind eachother.Sometimes it could work, othertim es. But the 

odds were against you becausethe greatestnumberof  Jews, particularly f rom Germany and 

 
13
 
sof orth, were dead, were killed.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W e have tim e to turn to our audience f or a f
ew questions. Does that soundok?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 O k.  
>> Bill Benson:
 
I have m any more to ask you but I think I'll give our audience an opportunity to 
ask you a couple of  questions.
 
 
I'm  going toask you,one, if would stay through the questionand answer p
eriod 
because I will turn back to Kurt at the endof  the program f orhim toclose the program f orus.
 
If you have a question, we ask that you use am icrophone.T here is a m ic coming down either 
aisle.T ry to m ake your questionas brief as you can. I'll dom y best to repeat the question so 

thateverybody, including Kurt and I, hear thequestion.
 
 
Anybody have a question they would like to ask Kurt?Otherwise I'll j ust continue. Is 
therea brave soul? Not yet. Oh,there we go. Ok. 
 
>>
 
I would like to know how
 
you were receive d in the UnitedStates.How did Am ericans
 
--
 
what did they think about what was going on?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The question, 
W
hatdid Am ericans think when you cam e here
? W
hat  d i d t he y 
think was going on and how were you received?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell, we were received by people who were some related to us,even distantly. 
My parents acclimated to the
 
states quickly. T hey didn'thave much choice.But it worked out 
pretty well. And, of course, atthat age I 
a
cclim ated very quickl y.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you were in a comm unity that had a large population
 
--
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
As I said,m ostof m y parents'f riends were people who were like them , 
im m igrants.I went to school, so I was exposed toa broader spectrum of friends. Ihadf riends, 

s o m e of t h em  we
re imm igrants and some of them weren't. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Ok. Do we have another question? 
 
 
W hile we're waiting, I wanted to ask you,Kurt, Jill, your wif e, has been with us each 
year since we began the program  in2000. So many tim es we've had a conversati
o n  wit h  Jill.  
T his is yourf irst tim epublicly speaking.W hatm otivated you todothis? 
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell,I've heard Jill speak about her experiences quite afew tim es
 a
nda lot of  
otherpeople in thism useum. And I guess
 
--
 
I know that a lot of  those 
people whohad spoken 
in the past aren't here anymore.W e're all advancing in age very quic kly and I decided maybe it 

was tim e f or m e to put this on the record for us, f or m y f am ily. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thankyou for doing that. 
 
 
Oneother question I have for you. Youm entioned early, and we saw in the 
photographs, you're related toAnne Frank. I'm  sure ouraudience would love to hear a little bit 

m ore about that. 
 

>> Kurt Pauly:
 
W ell, whathappened, of course, was, as I said, Mrs.
 
Frank's grandf ather, Anne 
F
rank's great grandfather, were m arried to som eone inm y m other's fam ily, an aunt ofm y 
m other. And it was a sm all Jewish community, relativel y speaking. T hey were ver y close,even 

as cousins. Som y m other knew them  quite well.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Do you have any recollection?
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
I really don'thave any recollection
 
of the  fa m ily 
m yself . My m other always sa id 
that sometim es when they would com e backfrom  Holland, I had played with Anne.She was a 

little bit older thanI was. But I can't really say that I rem em ber that. Although sheexplained a 

lot about thef am ily to me which we foundout was pretty reliable what she told me.W e'veseen 

thebiographical record onherf am ily.W hatever m y m other said seem s to be quite accurate. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Before w
e close, I think probably like ever ybody in the room , we have to really 

 
14
 
sort of  grapple, think about thef act that you've pieced together inf orm ation about what you 
went through, through different happenstance wa ys, going back to Germ any, seeing your 

home,
 
andf inding outthatpeople that live there could share with you things, coming across 
thenanny again af ter all of these years
,  be
cause of technology, family m em bersbeing able to 
f ind you orat least inquiry are you f am ily. Soall of  these years latery
o u ' re  s t ill f illin g in  m an y,  
m any details. It's pretty rem arkable,pretty rem arkable.
 
 
It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t P e rs on
 
that our First Personhasthe last word. SoI will turn 
back to Kurt to closeour program .Before Ido, I want to thank all of you for
 
being with us. I

>> Kurt Pauly:
 
Ok. I gu
ess I, of  course, feel
 
--
 
I'm  kind of split. On one sideI have this 
experience of having f led and growing up asan imm igrantand soforth. On the other side, 

we're Am ericanand I grew up that way. I went to schoolhere in this country. As youm entioned 

be
f ore, I was drafted during the KoreanW ar.I always tell the world I gave Uncle Sam two 
years of  
m y 
life and then he gave m efour years of  an ivy league school.

G.I. B
ill.

And being a disabled veteran,fortunately nottoo disabledbut somewhat, it 
doesn't bother me now but it did when we f irst got m arried, still noticeable. A lot of people
 
--
 
their f athers have to pay their tuition.
 
Inm y case m y rich Uncle Sam
 
paidfor m y tuition. And I 
really enjoyed that time will. I took advantage of  that.
 
 
W efeel, Jill andI, we have thism ixed thing.Our childrenare,of  course, 100% 
Am erican.T hey were born here. Butthey know aboutthis as well, so I think that kindof  

broadens their perspective a little bit in the world to know what happened, what their parents 

went through andtheirancestors who are no longer with us. SoI think that probably has som e 

eff ect on the way we li ve in this country. 
 

>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
 
And, of course, the museum  has been a wonderful contact for us. W e really 
enjoyed all of these years that we've worked with the museum . 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Spent a lot of  tim e here.
 
>> Kurt Pauly:
