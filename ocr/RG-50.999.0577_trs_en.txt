Es telle Laughlin was  born in Wars aw, Poland, on J uly
 
9, 1929. Poland is  highlighted on this

And Wars aw is  highlighted on this  m ap of Poland, als o in 1933.
 
 
Es telle was  the younger of two s is ters. In addition to her parents , her family inc luded many 
aunts, unc les , and c ous ins . The Nazis  invaded Poland on September
 
1, 1939. Soon after the invas ion, 
Es telle and her fam ily wer e for c ed to m ove into the Wars aw Ghetto. This  photo was  taken when Es telle

In 1943, the fam ily went into hiding in a bunker in the ghetto.
 
The Wars aw Ghetto Upr is ing 
began on Apr il
 
19, 1943, and c ontinued until the final liquidation of the ghetto on May
 
16, 1943. J ewis h 
fighter s fac ed over whelmingly s uperior forc es  of the Germ ans  but wer e able to hold them  off for  a

When Estelle, her s is ter  and mother arr ived in New York in 1947, they had $30 between them. 
Es telle and her s ister  went to work in the garm ent dis tr ict. She m et her husband, who was  a s urvivor

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Estelle, thank  you s o muc h for joining us and for your willingnes s to be our Firs t 
Person. Today we have jus t a s hort hour and you have s o muc h to s hare with us , s o we'll s tart right 
away.
 
 
You wer e just 10,
 
living in Wars aw, when Wor ld War II began, Germ any's invas ion of Poland 
in Septem ber
 
1939. Befor e we turn to what would happen to you and your  fam ily during the war and the 
Holoc aus t, s tar t, fir st, with telling us  a little bit about your  fam ily, your c ommunity, your life in Warsaw 
before war began.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  I was  born in Warsaw, Poland to a m iddle c las s  fam ily. War s aw was  the c enter  of 

m y univers e, in m y s elec tive memor y in golden radianc e of lilac  tr ees agains t open blue skies, r ic h 
s ounds  of
 
good neighbors , kindnes s and trus t and love. Magic  train rides  thr ough the c ountry with 
family bec ame s helters  in m y m em ory. As  a m atter  of fac t, when I los t ever ything, thes e memories  
bec am e my pos s es s ions.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You s aid to me "When I think of that time, I think of loving neighbor s , tr ains  to the 

c ountr ys ide, time with fam ily and friends. Ever ything was  br ight and wonderful." That was  your  life in 
thos e days .
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Yes. Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us a little bit about your father . Fr om what I've r ead about him in your book  and 

what you've told me, he was  a remarkable m an.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  My father was  m y [Indis c ernible]. He was  a wonderful m an. He taught m e the 
values  that helped m e s urvive with a lot of s uffer ing with love and c om pas sion and love for hum anity 
and joy for life. Life s hould be lived joyfully.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  m other , s he had fled from violenc e and anti
-
Semitis m in Rus s ia. J ust s ay a 
little bit about her , too.

> > Estelle Laughlin:  Well, unfortunately the J ewis h his tor y is  ver y c om plic ated. While the Holoc aust is  
the m os t horrendous
 
--
 
I don't mean to c ompar e but ther e wer e inquis itions, pers ec utions of J ews . And 
m y m other was  born in a s htetle in Belarus, in Rus s ia. And s he was  c has ed out by the Cossacks and 

then s he c ame to Poland, toWar s aw, married a m an that s he was  ver y muc h in love with, was very 
pr oud of her two c hildr en. And the s ec ond war , s he was  per s ec uted again. And I hope never, ever  
again.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ger many invades  Poland, beginni ngWor ldWar II. They attacked Wars aw that very 
day. What do you remem ber of that day and then of the s iege ofWar s aw?
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Imm ediately my life c hanged beyond rec ognition. Actually, it s tar ted out 
Septem ber
 
1. And suddenly we hear d this trem endous  explos ion and then s uc h s ilenc e as though all 
the air was  s ucked out of the univers e. And then the s irens and we hear d on the r adio that Poland was  
attacked, that bom bs wer e dropped on Wars aw without dec laring war. At that m om ent I s topped being 
a 
c ar e
-
fr ee c hild and took on the heavy burdens  of s uffer ing and war .
 
> > Bill Bens on: Wars aw held out for  a month following the German invas ion of Poland. You wr ote that 

the German Ar my marc hed intoWar s aw on October
 
1, 1939, and that imm ediately "My life 
c hanged 
beyond imagination." Tell us  about thos e c hanges onc e the Germ ans oc c upied Wars aw.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  They c ame to the hom es, streets , c ut off elec tr ic ity, r ationed all food, m ade books 
illegal, they c los ed s c hools . They then ver y s oon is olated us in a s m all ghetto. They built a thick  wall 

ar ound us. They filled the ghetto with dr oves  of Jewis h people dr iven out from s urr ounding ar eas . Ther e 
was  not enough food. There was  not enough c lothing. People wer e dying of star vation and c old and 
illnes s . 
They c over ed the bodies  of c hildren with pos ters s aying "Children ar e the hol
i
es t things. Our 
c hildren m ust live."
 
 
And yet, in this  inferno, people gather ed all the c our age that was  r eally in us  and fought s o 
her oic ally. Originally ther e was  a mor al r es istanc e. Imm ediately the J ewis h c omm unity in the ghetto 
organized its elf in a s elf
-
aid c enter. Everybody who had a little bit more than their neighbor s helped. 
There was  not a c hild in our  building.Wars aw was an anc ient c ity. And mos t people lived in apartm
ent 
buildings . Ther e was  not a c hild in our building over the age of 10 who did not in s om e way c ontribute. 
Ever y building had a kitchen for  the star ving neighbor s . So we would s tir the pots to help in the kitchen 

or  peel potatoes  or  we would c ollec t c lothing. We put on fabulous s hows  for  neighbors and c ollec ted 
m oney for the m or e needy ones .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Estelle, when you wer e forc ed to move into the ghetto along with s ever al hundr ed 

thousand other Jews , in a c om pac t area, a wall built around the ghetto, des c r ibe a little bit about that 
and what it looked like.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Well, ther e wer e 400,000 people liv ing in an ar ea appr oxim ately 1.3
 
m iles . So the 
c ongestion was enormous . In s om e buildings , 11, 12, 15, s ometim es even m or e people lived in
 
one 
r oom. There was  squalor. Ther e was  poverty. Ther e was  c hildren with bare feet on their knees begging, 
m any or phans. The squalor  was  terr ible.
 
 
You know, I s aid that
 
--
 
it's  very im portant for  m e to s har e the
 
her oism  of the people in the 
ghetto. Someti
mes  people ask me why didn't you fight back , why didn't the people in the ghetto fight 
bac k . But they did fight bac k . So ver y, ver y bravely. To own a book was  an ac t of defiance, c apital 
punis hment, punis hable by death; yet all over the ghetto ther e wer e sec r et libraries . My father had a 
s ec r et stas h of book s  by Yiddis h writers , Shalom Aleic hem , Shalom As c h, Is aac , at night with c overs  to 
keep our exis tent s ec ret in a small room  illum inated by a flickering lantern. My father  would pull out his  
books and r ea
d to us . Our  room felt like a c aps ule of par adis e s eparating us  fr om the silenc e, c urfew 
s ilenc e, outs ide our windows .
 
 
You know, all over  s c hools  wer e folded yet all over  the ghetto ther e wer e brave, unem ployed 
teac hers who r isked their lives  and met with
 
c hildren in sm all rooms  and taught them to hold on to their  
imagination and faith and love.
 
 
We even had theaters. Imagine theaters  when ther e was  no bread. There was  a ver y 
wonder ful and remarkable his tor ian in the ghetto whos e name was  Chaim  Kaplan. And
 
he s aid that it is  
as tounding that at a time when we don't s eem to need it at all, we need poetr y m ore than we need 

4 
 
br ead. And it is  true. The s oul needs to be nourished as  muc h as  the body does . I think  our ability, our 
c r eative ability, our  ability to 
t
hink  for  ours elves is  our Godlines s  and this  was  our  way of holdin
g on to 
our  culture, to our  Godlines s , to our humanity.
 
 
So thes e wer e s om e of the examples  of the squalor , of the pers ec ution, of the indignities , and 
the way that we held on to our dignity. And I feel that this  is  reflective of all of us ; that goodnes s  and 

love for beauty and love for humanity is  part of us.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wr ote in your  book  that c hildr en followed adult examples  to res is t bar baric  laws . 
"In our apartm ent c omplex there
 
was  no c hild over  10 who did not have some public  duty." J us t s ay a 
bit about that.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Right. In m y book  I des cr ibed how we put on the s ecret plays . You know, we 
c hildren had to hide our  books under our c lothes  to go to our s ecr et c las ses . Well, that took  a lot of 

c our age. As  a c hild, I don't think that I ever s topped and gave mys elf c r edit for the c our age it took  but 
now I s ee that it did take s uc h c our age. And c hildren are very wis e. In the pr oc es s of wr iting m y book , 
s eeing the c hild 
that I was thr ough the eyes  of an old wom an that I am now I s aw the wis dom of 
c hildren. I s aw how c hildr en know right fr om wr ong and how they m ak e c hoic es  and good c hoic es .
 
 
And for the c hildren in the audienc e her e, I feel self
-
c ons c ious about s har ing s om
e of the 
c r uelties  that I will be s haring but I want to r eassure you that if you hold on to that whic h is  bes t in you, 

you will always  be all right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Estelle, the Nazis  s tarted deporting large num bers  of J ews  out of Warsaw to death and 
c onc
entr ation c am ps in 1942. For a s ubstantial per iod of time, your  family was  able to avoid being 
deported. How did your par ents m anage to keep you from being taken by the Nazis
? 
How were you 
able to s urvive dur ing that tim e? 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  In July of
 
1942, the month of my 13th birthday, things bec am e even more 
grues om e. This was  the beginning of theWarsaw Ghetto Upris ing. We didn't have the faintest idea that 

the depor tation meant death. Some J ewis h people wer e forc ed to write fals e letter s to
 
famili
es  inviting 
them
 
to go to differ ent towns  where they were s helter ed and fed and c lothed. So you c an im agine that 
the famis hed people, the homeles s people, that m any people m arc hed unwillingly
 
--
 
I mea
n 
unknowingly and willingly to Umsc hlagplatz,
 
a deportation s tation and loaded on to fr eight trains  and 
dis appeared from our exis tenc e.
 
 
My fam ily
 
--
 
not everyone mar c hed. Many people, I don't know if mos t but many people, hid. 
Now, where does  one hide in an apar tm ent building
? 
Pr etty m uc h wher e I played with my grandc hildr en 
in hide and go s eek, between
 
--
 
behind c ouc hes , behind c hair s, under  beds .We hid between 
m attress es  and box s prings. Any c or ner  we c ould find, hoping that we would not be found. 
 
 
My family hid in a r oom . They obs c ured the door  with a wardrobe. So while we wer e hiding, 
people wer e m ar ched out of our life.We never  hear d from  the people who were taken away from us but 
s om e people, s omehow, managed to either hide under c or ps es or in s ome way avoid, at that point, 
being destroyed. And they c ame back  to the ghetto and they told us about thes e horr endous tr ain rides  
to a plac e c alled Treblink a, where our people were gas s ed.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Estelle, at som e point the Nazis  dec r eed that all c hildr en under the age of 14 were 
us eles s  to them . You were 13 at the tim e.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What did that m ean for you?
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Well, c hildren under  14 wer e c ontr aband and I was  13. I was  petrified that I will 
be
 
--
 
m y biggest fear was  to be separ ated fr om  my family. That was  very s trange to m e. I c ouldn't quite 
unders tand it. But I had one important wis h, that if I make m y trans ition to death, that I hold on to the 
hands  of my par ents. So I was  ver y fr ightened of being s epar ated from  them .
 
I had braids , s o m y 
m other  c ut m y braids, put m y hair  up, and dr essed me in more adult c lothes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To m ak e you look  older .
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  J ust to m ake me look older. And I asked m y father
 
--
 
I s aid to him , "What will y ou 
do if they c om e and get me?"  And he s aid, [Indisc ernible]. I believed him
; t
hat I was  loved, that I was  
s afe, if only in his  love.

> > Bill Bens on:  By Novem ber of 1942, 3/4 ofWars aw's  J ews  had been depor ted and killed. You and 
your  s is ter
,  
Fr edka
, 
were two of the 1% of c hildr en that wer e left in the Wars aw Ghetto. Almost devoid 
of c hildr en.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Right. We were among the 1% of c hildren. Can you im agine a wor ld without the 
s ounds  of c hildren
, w
ithout the pres enc e of grandm other s  and gr andfathers
? 
Bec aus e c hildr en and old 
people wer e
 
the fir s t ones  to be depor ted. It was  s uc h s ilence. Ther e was  s uc h, s uc h dr ead. There was  
s uc h emptines s.
 
 
I r em ember when I would walk up to the window or walk up to the gate of our  building and 
s tick m y head out hoping that I would hear a s ound of life and only s ilenc e c alled to m e. It was  s o 

palpable.
 
 
It's  amazing what hum an beings c an endure and rem ain hum an. It is really one of the r eas ons  
why I s hare m y story. And I'm s ure this is  one of the reas ons why you ar e all her e, to be rem inded that 

hum an beings ar e c apable of gr eat evil and then rec ognize the im portanc e of love and harmony and 
dignity of ever y individual.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At the s tar t of 1943, you went to work in a factor y, a German fac tor y. Tell us about that.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Well, be
fore that
 
--
 
oh, right. All the J ewis h people
 
--
 
ther e was  only a handful of 
people who r emained towar ds  the end of the liquidation of the ghetto. Very few thous and J ewis h people 

out of the 400,000 wer e still alive. Only the people who wer e us eful to the N azis  had a right to exis t. 

They were like demagogues. They dec ided who was  to live and who was  not to live. So ther e was  jus t 
a s m all gr oup of people who wer e per m itted to liv e provided they were not old, provided they wer e not 
c hildren, and provided thatthey were useful. Therefor e, to pr ove their us efulnes s , if they c ould find 
em ploym ent in thr ee fac tories , thr ee German factories , that were stationed in that s m all s ub ghetto. 
 
So ever yone
 
--
 
to get perm is s ion to wor k  in that fac tor y was  a lic ens e to live.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And in truth, you were a little gir l now working in a factory.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Right. Right. Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But having to pretend that you wer e older.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Oh, abs olutely.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you would c ontinue doing that not too terribly long bec aus e you wer e there during 

the r em arkable War saw upr is ing and then the horr ific  obliter ation of the ghetto.
 
Tell us what happened 
dur ing the upris ing with you and your fam ily par tic ular ly.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  So I s har ed with you that s om e people m anaged to com e to the ghetto and tell us  
about the horr ific tr ain rides  and about Tr eblinka. When the remainder of the Jewis h people, the sm all 
group of people, bec ame awar e of Tr eblinka, they began to organize thems elves  into arm ed res is tanc e. 

My father was  a mem ber of the arm ed r es is tanc e, too.
 
 
They s tarted to build bunkers  in the bas ements, a network of bunker s. They dug tunnels  s o 
that they c ould navigate between the bunkers and als o a tunnel under  the wall to be 
able to get to the 
Chr is tian s ide and get fr om the Polis h underground s ome am munition to fight with.
 
Unfor tunately not all 
the amm unition was  deliver ed and not all the ins truc tions were delivered either , s o you c an im agine 
thes e wer e warr ior s s o needy of ins truc tion and they didn't quite get it. So we had the bunker.
 
 
Events  er upted with Germ ans  entering the s mall ghetto. They enter ed with tanks and arm or ed 
c ar s  and lots of planes . There was  a big announc ement, humungous louds peakers, s aying that 

ever yone better repor t for  res ettlem ent. Of c our s e we knew what r es ettlement m eant
: o
r  they will 
des tr oy everyone. And when we hear d that, we had the bunker.
 
 
We used to live on the sec ond floor but we moved to the ground floor
, a
 
five
-
s tory building 
with four block
s.We were the only family. So there was  no is s ue. It was  eas y to find an apar tm ent on 
the ground floor. When we hear d that we better  repor t im mediately, we had the bunker and a s ecr et 

tr ap door in the powder  room  floor , the c om m ode lifted. We pulled the tr ap door down. I stepped down 
into the dam p, dank underworld whic h was  to be m y world for  who knows  how long. The c eiling 
pr es sed down on m e. The dam p walls  c los ed in on m e. The flickering of the light was  the s ubs titute for 
the s un. The c licking of the c lock was  our only c lue when morning was  r is ing and when s un was  s etting. 

6 
 
The few people who were in the dunker with me wer e m y whole nation. How I longed for  the open 
hor izon or  the blue cris pnes s  of day.
 
 
Should I pr oc eed?

F
ac ing 20th Century, arm ed from  head to toe, fac ing arm ored c ar s, fac ing flocks
 
--
 
the sky was  blac k  
with airplanes , bom bs dropping all ar ound us. It was  a small band of freedom fighters  poorly c lad, 
poor ly fed, poor ly ar med. They c lim bed up on rooftops . They s tepped in front of windows , opened the 
windows . They das hed out. 
S
ewer s  were als o a very es s ential way of c omm unic ation without being 
s een. They das hed out from the tunnels , from the s ewer s , and they lobbed Molotov c oc k tails , hand 

grenades , and whatever amm unition they had.
 
 
You know, it is really notewor thy that it took  this  handful of band of fighter s longer to fight than 
it took  for  Poland and Franc e to c apitulate.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  For one full month they held out.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How were you dis c overed? 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  At som e point a gr enade was  thrown into our bunker . We had no cor ner to hide 

anym or e. They dr agged us  out in the str eet. We did not march like a s warm  of nam eles s  people. We 

were people with nam es, with love. 
 
 
Sometim es c hildr en ask ed me how did you feel and I tell them I felt
 
jus t lik e you feel ins ide. 
They asked me did you feel ins ide. I tell them I feel
 
--
 
I felt jus t like they feel ins ide. I, too, wanted to 
c atc h a ball soaring in th
e air; I, t
oo, wanted to feel gr as s under m y bar e feet; I, too, wanted to take m y 
family, m y
 
par ents and friends  for gr anted. The only differenc e, the big differ enc e, was  that I c ouldn't do 
it and the c hildren then couldn't do it and m y grandc hildren and childr en today c an do it. And that's the 

way it s hould be.
 
 
So they dragged us  thr ough the bur ning ghetto. Flames , enormous  flames , were licking the 
s ky and painting it an outer  worldly c olors  of iridesc enc e. Plumes  of s m oke. Our lips  were c happed. 
They mar c hed us  to Ums c hlagplatz
 
and loaded us  on the freight tr ain.
 
 
In the m or ning we woke up, we 
ar r ived in Majdanek , an extermination c amp.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And I know that ther e aren't the wor ds  to des cribe it adequately her e but tell us  about 

Majdanek, whic h you went to with your  parents and your s is ter  and you would los e your father there.
 
>> Este
lle Laughlin:  Majdanek  was  s urr ounded by an elec trified barbed wire fenc e. There were 
c olumns
 
--
 
tower s  wher e the guards watc hed us. Every s tep we went with beam s  of light. In the c enter 
of the c amp was  a gallow from whic h the gibbets, our  fr iends  were dangling. I don't know why they 
needed to s c ar e us m ore and punis h us  s o m uc h mor e.
 
Within s ight ther e was  the gas  c hamber with 
the c himney. We worked. It was  c om pletely us eles s .We dug up dir t from one plac e and replac ed it and 

planted it in another place. 
 
 
You know, even in Majdanek , indes cribable inferno, we s till c ompos ed s ongs and poetr y. Of 
c our se, wom en
 
--
 
ther e wer e no c hildr en. There wer e no old people. Men wer e s eparated.
 
Ac tually, we 
knew that our exis tenc e there was  only for  one pur pose. We wer e waiting to be gas s ed, whic h leads  
pr obably to the next ques tion if I may jum p.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Pleas e.

> > Bill Bens on:  Fir s t, when did you know
 
--
 
when did you las t s ee your  father? 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  The las t time I saw my father was  when we were s epar ated. My father was  s itting 

with a group of m en. I was  s itting with a group of wom en. The childr en
 
--
 
ther e wer e just a few c hildr en 
that we kept in hiding in the ghetto, not to be s een. And they wer e dragged out. They we
r e in this little 

plac e that looked like a stable.
 
 
My father was  s itting with the m en. He was  s itting in front. He was  very s ic k . He had TB. His  
blood was 
cr im son
. He sat in fr ont of the r oad. Looked s o s ad. I was  s o used to looking into m y father 's 
eyes  
for  r eas s uranc e, for s teadines s, for love, and there he was  looking s o m iser able.
 
When the guar ds  

7 
 
walked pass ed u
s, I dashed in fr ont of him. I k neeled
 
down and I s aid, "Tata, don't wor r y, they won't get 
m e." I turned the lapel of my c oat
 
--
 
we had c yanide
 
s ewn into our lapel. I said, "Tata, they will never  
get m e. Rem em ber, I have c yanide." My father looked up to m e and he said, "No, darling. You must 
live."
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had a photograph of your  father  that you los t.
 

> > Estelle Laughlin:  Mm
-
hmm .
 
>
>  Bill Bens on:  Tell us how it was  taken from you. 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  When we ar rived in Majdanek  and I was  alr eady s epar ated from my father, was  

with m y m other and s is ter . My s is ter was  a year and a half older, was  als o 14 year s  old. We were 
m ar c hed, 
s ur e that we wer e marc hed to the s howers . And we knew what the s hower s  m eant.
 
Now, I 
s till had m y c lothes  on. I had one tr eas ur e that I hid under the lining of my s hoe. That was  m y father's 
photogr aph. A Ger man soldier  s topped me and he s aid, "What do you have hidden?"  He pr obably 
onc e hoped I had m aybe s ome gold or  s ome jewelry hidden. And I as s ur ed him , I s aid, "I have 
abs olutely nothing." He said, "Yes, you do." So quic kly was  thinking that the photogr aph
 
--
 
if he finds  
me
 
--
 
I didn't want to lie. So I thought if I show him  the photograph, it's s o us eles s  to him . I s aid, "I have 
one thing hidden." And I pulled out the photograph. And I s aid, "This  is my father. Can I have it?"  And 
he s natc hed it away. And that was  the las t pos s es s ion that I had. Yeah.
 
>
>  Bill Bens on:  Estelle, now it's  you, your s ister and your m other. In the time we have left, you would 
be at Majdanek  for a while, then m ove to s everal other c am ps . I know it's ver y hard to c om pr es s it but 

tell us  what happened to the thr ee of you fr om th
er e.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  I'm going to have to abbreviate ver y m uc h.
 
My m other and s is ter  and I had a pac t 
that if one of us would be s ent to the gas c hamber, all thr ee of us  would go. 
 
 
My m other, by the way, was  the only m other in the entir e c am p. All the other  mother s  were 
killed, to the bes t of m y k nowledge. We were the only family of three to the bes t m y knowledge that 

lived in that cam p. So ever yone els e pr actic ally was  alone. So we c ons ider ed ours elves  to be ver y 
fortunate.
 
 
My s is ter was  beaten very, ver y s ever ely. And the following day when we were to r epor t for 
work, s he was  not able to s tand up. I des cribe in my book the circ umstances . So we hid her  under the 

bunks.When m y m other and I c ame back  from  work, m y s ister ran up to us  and s he s aid
 
--
 
this is  the 
end. My s is ter  felt s o indignant about the hum iliating c onditions  of our  exis tenc e. For  instanc e, we didn't 

even have bathr oom s in Majdanek. Ther e was  one ditc h at the edge of the barbed wires  that was  an 
open pit. And the humiliation to go to the bathr oom with the guar ds standing guar d above. My sis ter 
s aid, "If they want to kill us , let them kill us ." So she s aid
 
--
 
s he jus t s ai
d 
I don't want
 
to live with s om e 
hum iliation.
 
 
While we wer e away and s he was  hidden, s ome German s oldiers c am e to th
e c am p and 
anyone they found they put on the lis t. So they put m y s is ter on the lis t. The as s um ption was  beyond 
any s hadow of a doubt that that m eant that s he's going to go
 
--
 
that s he was  on the lis t to go to the gas  
c hamber. So the only logic al thing to do was  for  my m other and me to trade plac es  with other two 
women who were on the lis t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To go to gas  c ham ber  with her.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  So that we go to the gas c hamber along. Thes e two other women traded plac es  
with the hope to s ee another sunr is e.Well, the following mor ning when they were c alling out the names  
and they c alled out my s is ter's  name and the names  of these two people that we, my mother  and I, took  
their names. So we repor ted. They put us on a train and we wer e s ent to Skarzys ko, whic h was  a s lave 
labor  c amp. There is  a s light differ enc e between exterm ination c am p and s lave labor c am p. An 

exter mination c am p was  a factor y, a m odern, humungous factor y of killing people. A s lave labor  c amp 
was  a plac e where you worked prac tically to death. And Skar zys ko and then later Czes toc howa. We 
worked in an amm unition factor y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to ask you
 
--
 
ther e's s o m any things that we don't have tim e for  you to tell. 
The fact that you and your  mother got on the lis t thinking
 
you wer e going to go to your death and that 

8 
 
ended up s aving your  life there. Shortly after on your  way to Skar zys ko on the train, the train s topped 
and, again, your  lives  were s aved there. Tell us about that.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Well, you know, sur vival
 
was m ostly r andom luck. 99% was  r andom  luck  and 
m aybe .5% was  
f
eis tin
ess
. But without the 
.
5% of feis tines s  you wer e 100% dead.
 
 
When we wer e on the tr ain, ther e was  one pit stop. My s is ter had to go to the bathr oom.We 
pleaded with her  not to go. She s ai d, "But I have to." So we were like one organis m . Wher ever we 
went, we went together so that if we live together  or die together . So m y mother and s ister
 
--
 
I and m y 
m other  followed m y s is ter. Then the guns started to pop. They c has ed us on to the train. Instead of 

going into the s am e tr ain that we were, we boar ded another  wagon.
 
> > B ill Bens on:  By mis take.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  We wer e jus t running from the bullets  flying ar ound. The for tunate thing was  that 

that train, that wagon, was  unloaded. In Skar zys ko there were thr ee branc hes  of am munition factor ies . 
And one br anc h was  wher e they were working on gunpowder  without any mask s  and for the whole day. 
And the people jus t turned, within a couple of m onths , abs olutely yellow, the c olor of the gunpowder . 
Th
eir lungs , they jus t s uffoc ated to death s o that coinc idenc e s aved our lives .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It's s uc h an under s tatem ent from reading your book  and having the opportunity to 

lis ten to you on a c ouple of oc c as ion that your m other was  jus t a r emarkable wom
an. Tell us  about the 
inc ident at Skarzys ko where your  m other  c onfronted a r eally brutal guar d, if you don't m ind.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Yes.Well, we hardly ever  s aw day light. You know, in this  mus eum, there is  the 

glas s dome. It's interesting, the ar c hitect, the reas on why he m ade the glas s  dom e was  bec aus e when 
he interviewed s urvivor s , they were s o awar e of the sky
 
--
 
whic h r em inds m e
 
--
 
I'm s orr y for digr ess ing 
but we mar c hed ever y day, of c ours e, to work and back to our barracks. And the one thing whi
le we 
were marc hing that I was  aware of was  the patc h of sky. So onc e we were marc hing like this , one kapo 

s tarted to beat another  one of the people, one of the J ewis h people. Of c ours e, ther e wer e always  
dogs. To this day I am afr aid of dogs . And my mother  stood up, the other woman, s tepped out of the 
m ar c hing of the s lave labor  people and s he s aid "Blood and m y grave will follow you for what you'r e 
doing to our people." So m y s is ter and I wer e s o afraid that they will s hoot us  on the s pot but they 
didn't.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think it was  at Skar zys ko that you and your  s ister and m other wer e r efer red to as the 
three m onkeys .
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Yes. Endear ing.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was  the or iginal title of your book , an affectionate term. Why did they c all you that? 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  We wer e s o c los e. We didn't take the instant for  gr anted that we had one another . 
And, of c ours e, we wer e all c overed with lic e and mange. And the lic e itc hed and you s cratc hed. There 
was  no medic ine, just s cabs  oozing. So we would just s it c los e together and pick lic e
, l
ike m onkeys . So 
our  friends , the people, would c all us the three monkeys  in an affectionate way.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the s um m er  of 1944, you wer e forc ed to move again, taken by tr ain to yet another 
c hamp c al
led Czestoc howa. That's where you would eventually be liberated fr om. Tell us a little bit 
about Czes toc howa and then your  liberation.
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  Well, Czes toc howa was  es s entially like Skar zys ko. It was  als o an amm unitions  

fac tor y. We wer e s o is
olated. It was  im pos s ible
 
--
 
we might as well have been on a differ ent planet. It 
was  impos s ible to im agine that only a f
ew r
abbit hops  away fr om us  people wer e s ailing on s ilver  lak es  
and c hildr en wer e s itting around tables  and having m eals as  c hildr en s hould. We had no idea if the 
allies  wer e winning or  losing. Here one night we're lying on our bare planks and we hear a rumble of 
planes . And we s ay, "Could it be?"  After all of thes e years
? 
Now, don't forget, this was  from  
September
 
1939 to J anuar y
 
1945. 
And then bombs  s tart dr opping. It was  like fr om heaven, to die by an 
allied bom b would be s uc h a dignified death. We wer e pleading, God, don't let them  s top bom bing. We 

were liberated the following day.
 
 
In my book I desc ribe what liber ation was  like. I ass ur e you, it was  not at all like anything you 
ar e likely to im agine. Very little has  been wr itten about liberation.
 
It was  J anuar y. Poland is  c old. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that was  an es pec ially awful winter. 
 

9 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  1945. It was  ver y c old. All we wore was
 
--
 
no under wear, no stockings, no 
s weaters , just wooden c logs. So I des cribe how the gate opened, how we s huffled out, how we s aw the 
Rus s ian s oldier s , how we r an up to them s aying, oh, like messiah was  here. And they put up their 
hands  and s
aid, ﬁ Sorry. We have a war to fight.ﬂ 
 
And, indeed, they had. The war  didn't end until May of 
that year. They gave us a s lab of br ead and they s aid be s ur e that you find s helter before nightfall. 

Curfew was still war . So we s huffled thr ough, starving.
 
 
Our
 
firs t m eal

s ome other people fr om  the c amp that m et us told us down the s treet there 
was  a pic kle factor y and ther e wer e windows  br ok en s o we c lim bed through the windows  and our firs t

them raw. Am azing how m uc h human beings c an endure and remain human and rem ain

And s uffering does  not have to drive you to des pair  and hate. It c an teac h you to love

that our Fir s t Per son has the las t wor d s o I'll tur n to Es telle to c los e it.
 
Once s he's finis hed two things  as  
fir s t question is  
c oming to the micr ophone. Two things , when Es telle is  done, our  photogr apher , Miriam, 
is  going to c om e up on the s tage and take a photograph of Estelle with you as  the back gr ound. So I'm 

going to ask  you all to s tand s o that we c an do that. And then we're 
going to tr y to get Es telle off the

Let's go ahead. We have two people br ave enough to ask ques tions.
 
> > Hi, Es telle. Thank  you for being her e today and pres enting us with the s tor y, first of all.
 
My question 
that I've had for  a long tim e is:What did you think  of when you were first told that J ewis h childr en 

weren't allowed to be played with, c ouldn't go to sc hool, you know, c ouldn't s hop in other stores and
 
other people c ouldn't s hop in the J ewis h s tores
? 
What did you think of the J ewis h
 
--
 
or the Ger man 
people at that time? 
 
> > Bill Bens on: What did 
you 
think of the Ger mans  when you wer e being told of all the things that you 
c ouldn't do as a c hild? 
 
>> Est
elle Laughlin:  What was  I thinking
? 
It was  incr edible. I had this impuls e to walk  up to a s oldier  
and s oldiers  and s ay: Don't you have a m other and a father  and c hildr en
? 
How c an you do it? 
 
Some par t in me believed that there was  humanity in their  hearts. I s till have to believe that it m us t be 
s om ewhere. It mus
t have been. It was  inc r edible. I c ould not understand. If you cannot tr ust 
adults
 
--
 
thes e were adults . I was  a c hild. If a c hild c annot trust adults, who can you trus t
? 
It was  ver y 
fr ight anythin

fr ightening.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.We have a young m an here with a ques tion.

d
, who were you liberated by, the Amer ic ans or  the 
Rus s ians ?

> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you. I think we have one more her e.
 
> > [Ques tion Inaudible]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The ques tion
 
was , was your fam ily a r eligious  fam ily
? 
And how muc h r ole did faith play 
in your life during that tim e? 
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  My fam ily was  not a religious  family. I'm not a r eligious  pers on. But I c ons ider 
m ys elf a very s piritual per s on. I feel c onnec ted with ever ything and
 
--
 
that is  living. I feel ver y m uc h par t 
of everything that is living. And m y family was  very humanis tic , ver y c onc er ned about kindnes s about 
c har ity, about hum an dignity.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you very muc h. 
 
 
I'm going to tur n to 
Estelle to c los e our pr ogr am. I think  where we left off, unfortunately, ther e's  
s o m uc h more to tell us with liberation and in early 1945 the war  would c ontinue, a time of c haos  and 
yet Es telle, her  s ister and m other went through unbelievable things after 
that
 o
nly to finally, two year s  
later, mor e than two year s  later, m ake it to the United States in 1947.
 
 
E s telle?
 
> > Estelle Laughlin:  I want to thank you all very m uc h for being in the mus eum here and for lis tening. 

Seldom are people willing to lis ten or
 
s peak  of s uc h experienc es  bec aus e it gener ates  s uc h pain; yet 
we have to be r em inded fr om  tim e to time what can happen us and to c ivilization. When we 

ac c ommodate ours elves  to tyranny, what it does to the cons c ienc e of a nation, what it does  to love, and 

what it does  to tr us t.
 
 
Your  being her e gives  me faith. My mother, in fr ont of the cr em ator ium , s aid "The world has  a 
c ons c ienc e. You will s ee if we s urvive that the Ger man c hildr en will be as k ing their parents  how c ould it 
have happened
. 
Wher e was  your  c o
ns c ienc e? 
And you know
? 
She was  r ight. Ger man people are now 
as king how c ould it have happened in our  c ountry. And I feel that we are all left with the legac y to 
unders tand that human beings  ar e c apable of cr uelties  and to unders tand the im por tanc e of love
, the 
impor tance of human dignity, everyone's  dignity.
 
 
Thank  you, again, s o very m uc h.
