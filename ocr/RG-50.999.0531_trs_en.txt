[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Anna, thank  you s o m uc h for  joining us  and for  being willing to be our  First Per
s on 
today.  Thank  you for that.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Thank  you.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Anna, you have s o m uc h to tell us  and we have just an hour s o we'll get started.  You 

were jus t 13 when World War II began with Germany's  invas ion of Poland in September
 
1939.  Bef
or e 
we tur n to all that happened you and your fam ily dur ing the war  and the Holoc aus t, let's start first with 
you telling us  a little bit about your  family, your c omm unity, and you befor e the war began.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  Bec aus e I have a very s hort tim
e to tell my story I'm going to try to tell the most 
impor tant things  that happened.
 
Befor e the war we lived in peac e in Rom ania.  My father was  a m erc hant.  My m other had to 
deal with the s ix gir ls.  From the s ix gir ls , two were in gymnas ium in the next city and the res t, we were 

in s c hool.  We had a really good life bec aus e we did not have a financ ial pr oblem .  My father was  not a 
poor  m an.
 
As  Bill s aid befor e, the good life ended in 1940 bec aus e then the Germans  invaded Romania.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you talk about that, c an I as k  you a c ouple of other  questions ?  You told me that 

both of your parents  wer e very well
-
r es pec ted in the c omm unity.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes, they wer e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Will you s ay s om ething about that?
 

3 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  They wer e res pec ted becaus e my father  was  an educ ated m an before the Fir st 
WorldWar.  He fought in the Hungar ian Army.  He bec am e an offic er , a lieutenant.  But after he 
m arried m y m other in Romania
 
--
 
he r emained in Rom ania bec aus e
 
--
 
he marr ied m y m other  bec
aus e 
he fell in love after the war  c am e to see us.  He fall in love with m y mother  bec aus e s he was  beautiful 

and [Indis c er nible].  [Laughter] 
 
So we lived a good life befor e that
 b
efor e 1940.  1940 c hanged our  life com pletely.  Not until 
1942 bec aus e two years  we lived a regular life, lik e we us ed to.  We didn't feel anything that our  life had 

c hanged.  But 1942 s tarted the humiliation.  They took  the lic ens e of our  store. We got the yellow star.  
We c ouldn't go to the street bec aus e we were J ewis h. We lived about two years  like that.
 
So after  two year s
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Anna, if you don't m ind, I'm going to ask you questions  from  tim e to tim e.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Sur e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was n't too long after the war began, I think when you wer e 14, that you c ould no 

longer go to school.  Is  that c or rect? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  When the Hungar ian occ upied Trans ylvania
,  
they stopped J ewis h people to go 
to higher s c hools .  It was  at that age that I had to go to higher sc hools  but they did not let J ewis h 

peop
le go ther e.  So I rem ained without an educ ation and m y younger s is ter s  als o.  Only the older 
s is ter s went to high s c hool and c ollege bec aus e Romania
 
--
 
Romania left that to it.
 
So in 1944 happened the tr agedy.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we get to that a few m ore ques tions, if you don't mind.
 

> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  Sur e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So after you los t your s tor e and your  vineyard, how was  y our fam ily able to m ake ends  

m eet and feed the family ?  How were you able to do that?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Well, it was  very
 
har d.  Som ehow we sur vived it.  We got s om e food by tickets .  My 
father stor ed s ome food for  us.
 
But in 1944
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we get to 1944
 
--
 
I don't want to skip over everything.  Your oldest s ister, she 
had gotten m arr ied and
 
--
 
your  oldest s ister had gotten m arr ied and had a baby.  At one point s he 
m oved back hom e with the family.  Why did s he m ove back hom e? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Bec ause her hus band was  s ent to for c ed labor. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To forc ed labor.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  And they took  their  lic ens e als o.  So s he c am e home with the little 2
 
1/2
-
year
-
old baby.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And one of the things you told me, that dur ing that period even though you'r e under the 

Hungar ian oc c upation and the war  is going on fr om  1940 to 1944, in that time, I think  you told m e you 
never s aw, at that time
, 
a s ingle Ger m an s oldier .  It was  the Hungarians  that were bas ically oc c upying 
you.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And c aus ing all the ver y diffic ult tim es .
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Only the Hungarians .  Not German
s. 

> > Bill Bens on:  And befor e the Germans oc c upied Hungary in 1944, was  it r ight before then that your 
father als o had to leave? When did that happen? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  They took  him in 1942. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In 1942.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Befor e the family.  
Before us.  In 1944, they c am e and all the J ewis h people fr om the 
town they put them in a synagogue and they kept us  ther e for about thr ee days .  I r em ember it was 205 

people ther e but all c hildr en
 a
nd wom en
 b
ec aus e the men wer e in for c ed labor .  So we were s taying 
ther e for  two days  in the s ynagogue.  After one wom an had a little baby ther e in the s ynagogue, they 

took her  als o.  They took  us in a ghetto in Satu
-
Mar e, 37
 
kilom eter s from  our little village.
  
We did not 
s tay too long ther e bec aus e Hungar y was
 
the last c ountry that the Ger mans  invaded befor e other  
c ountries in Eur ope.  So they had to finis h us  befor e the war is  finis hing.  That was  1944.  
 
In 1945 alr eady the war

> > Bill Bens on:  Anna, tell us , do you r emember going into the ghetto?  Do you 
remem ber going there?  
Even though you wer e there two or  three week s , what was  it like for you and your  family in the ghetto? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Well, we took  s om e food with us bec aus e other wis e we would not have.  All the 

37
 
kilometers , people s et in a wagon with horses but I walked the 37
 
kilometers.  We s topped only for  
one night s itting on the floor  going there. 
 
In the ghetto, m any families  in one plac e s o we had to s leep on the floor.  But we were waiting 
that we s hould go out from  there bec aus e that was  not
 
--
 
we thought from  this  c annot be wors e than 
this .  But later  we s aw that ther e is  muc h wors e than that, than jus t s leeping on the floor. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And Anna, when you were in the ghetto, your  father, as you told us, had been taken 
away in 194
2.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Had you hear d from him ? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Onc e we hear d from him.  He s ent a pos tc ard that he's  a tr ans lator  in a c amp near 
Budapes t.  But after  that we never  hear d of him.
 
After a few days , they took  us  on the tr ain
 
and they put us in wagons .  I was  the 92nd pers on in 
that wagon.  What happened in that wagon, it's unbelievable.  There were c hildren, old men, s ick  
people
.  C
hildren c ried
.  P
eople pr ayed
.  P
eople c urs ed. We had no room there.  It was  one place in 
the 
c orner wher e we had to do our things  ther e, you know.  And fr om tim e to time the train s topped and 
they emptied ther e.  And then they asked who has  money or jewelr y.  People wer e afraid bec aus e they 

s aid if you don't give it to us  now, when we ar r ive they will s ear c h you and s hot you.  So people, what 
they had they gave the jewelr y and the money but they s till s hot them. 
 
So after  that happened, we went back in the wagon.  I think  for four days  we were on that train.  
We arr ived in Aus c hwitz at night.  We wer e dizz y and tired and c ouldn't even think.  They put us  five in 

a r ow, all of us.  The dog barked.  It was  a neon light.  It was  mus ic , als o.  Som e J ewis h haftling, they 
c alled us
.  T
hey played m us ic . We were s o mixed up at this .  I c ould not think what
 
happened to us . 
 
So we s tand five in a r ow.  An offic er c ame later.  They s aid that he's Dr.
 
Mengele.  You go on 
this  side.  You go on the other s ide. 
 
My m other, my older  s is ter and her baby and m y younger s is ter, 
the s ixth s ister, they went on one s ide and I and thr ee other s is ter s  were in the other  s ide.  We never 
know what happens
. B
ut they took  us in a r oom  and they s haved our head and anywher e wher e it was  
hair.  I r emember I had four br aids  and they put it s eparate.  Probably they us ed it for s ometh
ing. 
 
After that
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Anna, I'm  going to ask you one question befor e you c ontinue.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Sur e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When the s elec tion took  plac e, tell us  what you told me about one of your  other sister s  
was  holding the baby and s om ebody s aid, "Is that your baby?"
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  One of m y s is ters hold the baby befor e we got off from the tr ain.  Som ebody 
as ked, "Is  that your  baby?"  And s he s aid, "No."  Then the m an s aid, who was  a J ewis h man who 
worked ther e, "Give it to her  moth
er ."  Bec aus e otherwise who had the baby in their hands, they put it 

as ide bec aus e c hildr en would make c haos .  They take away fr om their mother or parent. 
  
S o m y 
s is ter 's  life was  s aved bec aus e s he gave the baby to her m other. 
 
I have to c ontinue there.  They put us in a room after they s haved us .  And they dis infected us  
with s ome white dus t.  We did not rec ognize eac h other , the four s ister s.  Bec aus e we looked terr ible 

after  we wer e s haved and we had white dus t and all.  And they took  us in a plac e.  I think  it was  a hors e 
s tall.  We s pent the night in that hor s e s tall.  And in the mor ning we c alled eac h other  by name becaus e 
we c ouldn't r ec ognize eac h other the way we looked after the four days  on tr ain tr aveling and after 

s ha
ved.  So we c alled eac h other by nam e. 
 
After that they took  us in Aus c hwitz in barr ack s  where ther e wer e bunk beds  there.  Nothing 
els e to c over  us  or s om ething.  They gave us  a gray dr es s  with a number on the s leeve bec aus e they 
did not have tim e to tatt
oo us .  
 
So after  we stayed in Aus c hwitz there for a few days , we thought this  is terr ible.  The food was  
terr ible, terr ible.  It was  always  s om ething in the food bec aus e they didn't wash the c arr ots, potatoes  

5 
 
and beets.  And we had to drink one after  the other .  By the time the dis h got to the s ixth pers on, ther e 
was  nothing in it.  So nobody wanted to be fifth in that line. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Anna, as  you just told us, they didn't have time to tattoo you.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  No.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that was , in large part, bec aus e they were br inging in s o m any hundreds of 

thous ands  of J ews  fr om  Hungary that it was  jus t way too many for them to do them.  That's why they 

put the number on your sleep.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Exac tly.  Yes. 
 
So after  we wer e there for  abo
ut
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One mor e question.  At that point, after  you were ther e almos t a week , did you know 

what had happened to the rest of your fam ily?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  We did not want to believe it bec aus e there were 
Czec hos lovakian
 
gir l there and 
we as ked wher e are our  parents and she s aid ther e, there, in the flu, you k now, you c r azy, you idiot.  

How do I s ay that?  How c ome you got here?  Didn't you know about what happened to us ?  You idiot.  
 
 
And we s aid we didn't know nothing about that.  And even if we would know what happened to 
you, what would m y mother  do with the s ix girls  and one granddaughter  when m y father was  not hom e?  
We didn't know how to hide or s omething. We did not believe what happened, that our par ents are 
the
r e and the c hildren in the crematory.  Ther e was  a smell there.  It was  always  dark  there.  In that 

Aus c hwitz.  We lived in the barracks number 10.  And s om e friends  of ours lived in bar racks number 
12.  Came one day that they s elec t people, young, str ong people, and they take them to work .  So we 
thought anything c an be better than staying her e.  Twic e a day c ounting us, in the morning and at night.  
We c ouldn't r un away any way from there.  But they did that.
 
 
They s elec ted all the time who was  very 
sick o
r  very fat.  They put them as ide.  You don't 
know never what happened to them.  I m ean, we knew later. 
 
 
We went from  barr ack s  10 to 12 bec aus e you wanted to be c hos en for  wor k .  All the four  of us 
went ther e and we wer e luc ky
; 
we wer e c hos en bec ause we wer e all healthy looking, healthy gir ls.  So 
they took  us  fr om there, from Aus c hwitz, in another c am p. We s tayed ther e for about two, thr ee days .  
 
 
And fr om ther e they took  us  to the plac e where we were going to wor k .  It was  a huge farm.  
We c ouldn't 
s
ee 
the end of that far m.  We had to build an air port fr om  that farm .  But first we had to 
take out the c arr ots and the beets and whatever it was  in the farm .  And whoever  tr ied to pic k  up a 
c ar r ot, eat it, or  a potato or s om ething, they took  the num ber  fr om  h
er e, the guards who c ame with us , 
and gave it at night over to the r egis ter, a huge wom an at least 300
 
pounds , and another  one.  And they 
were punis hed, 25 
las hes  
on her  back , lower  than the back . 
 
And next day s he had to be at wor k .  
Other wis e they would send back to the c los es t c rematorium .  And, of c ours e, everybody who got that 

punis hment, they tr ied to go the next day to work.
 
 
I left out s om ething.  When we s tarted to work in that c amp, it was  not ready, the cam p, yet.  
So we had to go for about a mile and a half with s traw, c arr y it on our back , and put it in the barracks 

bed there.  And we did not have water yet.  The fountain was  not ready.  It c ame r usty water  fr om it.  No 

food then.
 
 
So we did that the fir st day.  It was  ter rible.  Like yes ter day,
 
over  100
 
degrees.  And there was  
a girl, the dr es s did not cover all of our  body, only to here, and lower  than the knee.  So they put s om e 
paper on it in whic h fir st was  c ement in that paper to pr otect the legs.  When they finis hed, they took  off 
the paper  but it c am e off with the skin bec ause it was  hot.  
 
 
So what did they do?  We wer e 800 wom en ther e.  They s ent back to the c r em ator ium , whic h 
was  very c los e to that plac e, and they brought other  people, healthy people bec aus e it had to be 

c om pleted with 800 people.  Our work  was  that we had to fill c ars  with s and.  And one thing came after 
the other to fill it.  It was  thr ee people at one c ar .  It had to be filled by the tim e the other c ar was  filled 
and the other train c ame. 
 
So we did that all year.  That was  our work. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So filling thes e tr ain c ar s  filled with s and bec aus e that would be us ed to lay the 

foundation for the airfield.
 

6 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  And the Frenc h were pr is oners .  They built a hangar where the planes  go in, a 
big hangar .  But we were not c los e to the Fr enc h war pris oners .  J us t s aw eac h other when they get 
hom e or we got hom e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thes e wer e Frenc h pr is oner s of war ?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yeah.  They were Frenc h pr is oners  of war.  They did the hangar and the c em en
t.  We 
only filled the c ars with the s and.
  
So that's what happened all year .  
 
 
I'm going to make now a big step.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you tell us that, you wer e there in hot weather and c old weather .  You told m e 

that all you had
 
--
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Ye
s.  We did not have under c lothing, jus t the dr ess . Wintertim e they gave us  a 

heavier dr es s  but summer  tim e we had the gray, thin dress .  But wintertime they gave us  the s triped 

dr es s but it was n't
 
--
 
all wintertime we c ould not was h our  dr es s bec aus e it wouldn't dr y.  Summ ertim e 
we was he
d our  dr es s .  We wer e lucky that we had a was h room.  Not every c am p had a was h room .  

So we had the was h r oom . We was hed our dress  and s lept on it to get dry until m or ning.  And we 
s leep two people in one bed bec aus e that was  even war mer.  But winter tim e we c ould not was h our  
dr es s. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, Anna, of c our s e, as you des c r ibed, you wer e doing
 
--
 
you only touc hed on it
 
--
 
this  
pr ofoundly hard labor  you were doing.  What was  your food s ituation like ther e?
 
>> An
na Gros z:  The food s ituation was  always  the s ame, exc ept one day.  It was  always  c ar r ots, 
tom ato, mos tly beets s
oup
.  And it always  r em ained s and in it bec aus e they did not was h it r ight.  The 
s and always  r emained in the dis h ther e.  We got in the m orning
 
a s mall piec e of bread with a ver y s mall 
piec e of m argar ine and a little named c offee.  Hot water  or  s om ething like that. We all los t weight.  We 

all were terr ible looking.  But we s ur vived.  I don't know how but we s urvived. 
 
 
Now I'm  going to
 
--
 
not to
o muc h time fr om  now.  I wanted to tell s om ething that was  m y luck 
that I'm still alive. 
 

 
Chr is tmas tim e the Ger mans  wanted to do a party for  them.  I m ean, the guards  who were 
taking c ar e of us.  They s aid, well, in 800 people there were talented people:
  
s
ingers , danc ers .  So we 
went to their  party.  
 
 
Yes , I left out that we had a guard who c am e fr om  Romania.  He was  a Germ an Romanian.  
He was  a nic e, good m an.  He liked me to s ing for him Rom anian popular  s ings.  And anytime he was  

our  guar d he made m e
 
to s ing for him. We not bec am e friends.  He never  gave me a piece of bread 
m or e or s omething but he knew about us that we ar e the four s is ters , the Romanian s is ters . 
 
 
So when it was  the party for  the Germ ans, we s at
 
--
 
who was  not partic ipating in the 
e
ntertainment, we wer e s itting in bunk beds, like that.  And I was  on the top of that bunk  bed.  He came 
to me and he s aid
:  W
hy did not you c am e to s ing?  And I s aid
 b
ec ause I don't think that I had that 
m uc h talent that I s hould sing her e in
 
front of the 
public .  He s ays :  No, you just c om e bec aus e I want 
you to s ing Rom anian.
 
 
So while I wanted to c ome, off the bed I fall.  I br oke m y leg. What happened to the s ix people 
ther e, they s ent back  to the c r em ator ium and br ought s ome other people ins tead bec aus e we have to 
be 800 c om plete always .  I thought now is  m y end.  And m y s is ter, my other , went to that
 
--
 
he was n't 
even an offic er .  That happened Chris tmas night, Dec ember. 
 S
he went and begged him that they 
s hould not s end m e back  to the c rem atorium becaus e the older , a big woman, was  his  girlfriend.  So he 
went to the gir lfr iend
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  She's  the one who las hed everybody?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  She's  the one who las hed, and another one als o, yes .  And m y leg was  put in 

cast, 
not s ent back  to the c los es t c rematorium.  That was  a mir ac le, r eally.  I never  hear d that a 
Germ an, was n't even an offic er
,  
to s ave a life for a J ewis h h
aftl
ing, pris oner.  So they put my leg in a 
c as t.  It wasn't a doctor who did that.  It was  a nur s e
, a
 
m an.  And m y leg
 
got s o s wollen that they had 
to take it off, no injections, no put to s leep or  anything.  They took it off bec aus e m y leg got very, very 

s wollen.  So they put another c as t on it.  
 

7 
 
 
That was  in J anuar y.  They took  off the c ast from  my leg bec aus e I had to
 
go to work  after 
that.  But the war  was  already known that it's  lost fr om the Germ ans .  And the Ger mans  did that fr om 
ever y c amp.  They did not have the time to put them in c r emator ium s becaus e they were always  
working, working.  And to put the people also who wer e wor king, they did m ar c hes.  They marc hed.  
 
 
It was  Febr uary.  The s now was  ter r ible.  
W
e had the s hoes
 
--
 
the bottom  of the s hoe
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on: Wer e they wooden? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  I'm having a s enior m om ent.  I don't rem em ber .  [Laughter]
 
>
> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  That happens  to me very often.  How do you s ay
 
--
 
> > B ill Bens on:  Clogs? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Huh?
 

> > Bill B ens on:  Clogs.
 
>> 
With wooden.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Wooden!  That's  what I didn't r emember . Wooden.  Yes .  So the s now stick 
to that 
wooden, you know.
 
 
So the tim e c am e when our  c amp had to marc h als o.  And the people who c ouldn't walk, of 
c our se they c ouldn't go to the mar c h.  I c ouldn't walk that far with m y broken leg but thr ee of m y s is ters , 

they had to m ar c h.  They had to g
o. 
 
I think  one of the most ter rible day or tim e in my life was  when m y 
thr ee s is ter s  left and I r em ained in that c am p by mys elf.  
 
 
They took  off m y shoes bec aus e they s aid you don't need s hoes  anymore.  Shoes  ar e for 
people who m arc h. 
 
So I was  s itting in the s ide of a bed with no s hoes .  My  s is ters  are gone.  I don't 
know about m y par ents.  I felt it's  better to die now than to live m or e.  But ther e wer e m ore s ick  people, 
at leas t m aybe 20 more, 21 with m e.  So the r est of the 800, they left.  They m ar c h
ed.
 
 
I r em ained ther e.  One pers on c ame to m e who k new me before.  She ask ed m e
 
--
 
oh, I'm 
s or r y for you becaus e I k now your  three s isters left and do you know s om e s ewing, to do sewing?  And 

I s aid yes .  I really did know how to s ew.  My m other want the u
s all to learn a little s ewing.
  
So s he took  
m e with them .  They were otherwis e als o in the kitc hen.  They took in the kitchen.  They made the 

c ivilian outfits  for the Germ ans , the guards  who were ther e.  They prepared them if they have to r un.  
 
 
So I was
 
ther e with them s ewing the c ivilian outfits  for the Germ ans.  I had the r ight to go into 
the kitc hen to br ing out water bec aus e they knew that
 
--
 
at the s am e tim e, they jus t c am e and cam e, 
the walking people, you know, m an
 
--
 
m os tly man, ver y tir ed and ver y s ic k .  Every day died I don't know 
how m any.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So, Anna, thes e wer e people on Death Mar c hes c om ing and they would s top there.  

Many would die.  Then they would move to the next plac e c los er to Ger many.  But you s tayed behind 
with this  gro
up of women in the c amp.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes. 
 

 
So they m ade a big hole.  They put the people who died, just thr ew them  ther e.  Every day I 
s aw a m an put them in a little c art or s omething.  He was  the one who put the people in that hole. 
 
For  two or thr ee
 
days  I didn't s ee him .  I 
s aw
 
that he was  in that c ar t.  So they took  him in that hole. 
 
I c an't tell how m any died bec aus e they were s o exhaus ted and sick  that they died. 
 
 
The day c ame
 
--
 
very c los e
 
--
 
a few more m inutes I have.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You'r e 
ok .
 
> > Anna Gros z:  The day c ame when the Germ an guar ds who were with us , they were pr epar ed, they 
took alr eady the outfits  from  what we m ade with the other  five people there and they wer e r eady to go 
to leave the cam p als o bec aus e the Rus s ians wer e alread
y very c los e.
 
 
The air port that r emained, it was  bom bed, a plac e fr om a distance.  One day I hear d that they 
all went in the whole air por t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Germ ans  blew up the air por t?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  They blew up.  It s hould not r emain for the Rus s ians  or whoever would have it. 
 

8 
 
 
After that, it was  quiet for a day or s o.  One of the gir ls  who I was  s ewing together c am e to 
m e, that this  night we are going to leave the Germ ans.  They want us go to protect them
 b
ut you will 
not
 
--
 
don't c om e with us .  You s tay here and you pr obably will be liber ated. 
 
 
I r em ained ther e with who were alive.  And when the bom b blew up, it was a few
 
--
 
s ix people 
in the barr ack s .  They died.  But we had time to run away who c ould r un.  And I run into a bas ement 
ther e where they us ed to keep the food for us.  A few mor e like me were in there, in the bas em ent. 
 
I c am e out from that basem ent and I s aw a Ger man c arr iage with a Red Cr os s , the last German 
c ar r iage.  
 
 
After that it was  quiet.  So we s tayed ther e one day.  We s till wer e afr aid to come out fr om  
ther e.  We c ame out.  I saw two little dots from  far away.  I don't know why I felt dizz y but later I found 
out.  I s aw thos e little dots  c om ing clos er and c loser and they wer e two Rus s ian s oldier s .  So we all 

c am e out fr om the
 
bas ement.  No Germ ans ar ound.  But they s till were looking for Germans , you know, 
for s oldiers .  I felt dizz y.  I got Typhus  ther e in the bas ement.  Who knows
,  
it was  in m e befor e. 
 
 
So the Russ ians cam e.  They photographed the hole, us , ever ything.  So they took  me in a 
hous e.  They s haved my hair  again bec aus e
 
--
 
I had s hort hair.  It was  all blond from  the s un.  It was  s o 
hot in Gdansk was  this  cam p of ours .  I woke up without hair again.  I didn't know what happened to m e 
for at leas t two weeks  I didn'
t know.  I was n't c onsc ious .
 
 
After we wer e a few there, we didn't know what to do.  The Germ ans  wer e gone.  The 
Rus s ians  were in but they did not c are of us bec aus e they still have a war going on m any plac es.  They 

took us in
 
--
 
not a c ar.  Again a s enior
 
m om ent.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Like a truc k?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Tr uck!  [Laughter]
  
And they took  all day long about the tr uck. We wound up in the 
s am e plac e that we wer e.  [Laughter]
 
 
So they took  us to the tr ain s tation.  We s lept on the floor ther e.  It took almos t two months to 
get hom e because nobody c ared about us.  We went to Polis h people to as k  for food.  They s aid they 
don't have them s elves .  So I don't know how we s ur vived fr om  one tr ain to the other.
 
 
I m et ther e people who s aw my two s is ters  after the liber ation.  They pr oved to m e that it was  
m y s is ter s.  I r ec ognized them.  And I ask ed wher e is  m y other sis ter , the older  s is ter .  They s aid my 
two s is ter s, when they cam e hom e and m et at home
 
--
 
they never  told me but they thought s he died in 
a hos pital but s he was  shot with the other  people who c ouldn't walk in the day of the liber ation.  She 

c ouldn't take it anym ore. 
 
 
S o I m et
 
--
 
after that wandering all over Poland
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  For almos t two months
 u
ntil you got hom e.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  
Alm os t two months.  
 
 
When I was  liberated, I was  not happy at all
 b
ecaus e I did not have not m y three s is ter s, not 
m y parents .  I realized it was  tr ue what the people told m e.  I thought: Why s hould I go home?  That's  
har d to under s tand.  I don't wis h anyone to have that feeling what I had then
, t
hat I was  liberated and 
not happy.  But I found out that only two s is ter s are alive fr om the whole fam ily.  We were nine people 

in the fam ily, m y father , m other, the s ix gir ls, and one gr anddaughter .  And the three of us met after we 
got hom e in Rom ania.  They got hom e s ooner than I with about two or  three weeks .  They went thr ough 
all that I went thr ough.  They c ouldn't get home.  Nobody c ared. 
 
 
And the other  terrible day that was  in my life was  that we had to g
o in our  hous e, r obbed from 
ever ything, em pty. We had a big hous e, s ix big r ooms , two kitc hens.  No fur niture.  Nothing.  J us t the 

three of us  to s tart a new life now. We wer e not trained for life bec aus e we wer e too young for that but 
we had to start a new life.  And that was  m y m ost ter rible day in m y life
, w
hen we had to s tar t a new life. 
 
 
And c ame a pr oblem after  that.  All the forc e labor men, they were killed before they got to 
Aus c hwitz.  The Hungarians  did that to them.  So w
om en 
went hom e and we
 
did not find m en to mar ry 
them.  We wer e thr ee big gir ls  ther e.  My s is ter was  20.  21.  I was  19.  And Clar a was  17.  
 
 
Des tiny works  s ometim es .  I think  all the tim e destiny wor ks .  Som ehow my older sis ter, we 
got a dis tant c ous in who had a dis tant c ousin and we brought them together  with my s is ter .  So s he got 

m arried.  To your father.  And we had a m an!  And he handled all the vineyar d, the things he had.  But 

9 
 
m y new brother
-
in

law did not want to s tay ther e in that village.  He wanted to m ove back where he 
c am e from, from another village.  But he c ouldn't do that bec ause I was  ther e and m y younger s ister  
was  there. 
 
 
Well, I had to get m arr ied.  I just c ouldn't find a man.  [Laughter]
 
I was  already 19, 20 year s 
old.  I felt like an old m aid.
 
>> 
[Laugh
ter] 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  No m en around.  It's a tr ue story, you know.  All the people got marr ied.  My friend got 

m arried.
 
> > B ill Bens on
:  An entire generation of m en killed.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  An entir e gener ation.  A few c am e hom e.  For exam ple, a fr iend of m ine who 
was  als o 20 like me got married to her br other

law who los t his  wife and two c hildren.  He was  40 
year s  old and s he was  20 year s  old.  And they got married.  Becaus e they had no c hoic e. 
 
 
So after
 
--
 
nobody was  in the village but I was  the
 
only one who didn't get m arr ied. 
 
One day I went to the c los es t c ity.  I found a fr iend
 
--
 
I m et a friend ther e who was  together  in the 
c onc entration c am p.  She was  alr eady pregnant.  She s aid, "How c om e you didn't get marr ied?  You're 

not too ugly."
 
>> 
[
Laughter] 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  And I said "Bec aus e no m en around."  She s aid to me, "I know a m an for you.  My 

hus band has a cousin who is  30 year s old and he wants  to get m arr ied bec aus e he needs  s omebody 
als o."  And I s aid "10 years  differenc e does n't m ean a
nything.
ﬂ
  
If he's not c rippled
 
--
 
or even if he's 
c r ippled, I'm going to m ar r y him .  That's  all.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Anna Gros z:  [Laughter ]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you did.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.  I went to m y fr iend's  house.  He c ame to my fr iend's  hous e ther e.
  
And I m et a 
hands om e, tall, good
-
looking m an.  [Laughter] 
 
And I was  thinking
;  W
ill he m arr y m e?  I c over ed my 
legs bec aus e I always  had heavy legs .  I took a long dres s that he s houldn't s ee it you know.  He didn't 
s ay a word.  He was a very quiet m an.
  
And I wanted alr eady to ask  me to mar r y him.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  And
 
--
 
no.  This  is  a tr ue s tory.  Believe me.  [Laughter] 
 
He went home without s aying 
one wor d. What's going to happen to m e? 
 
 
So he c ame back the next week.  I thought, oh, he's  still interested.  He said that he has  a 
br other
-
in
-
law who c am e hom e fr om the c am p with her s is ter 's hus band and he knew our fam ily, m y 
par ents who were ver y r es pec ted people in the town, and he knew that we wer e not poor people so he 
was  very poor . 
 
So he s aid you marr y that gir l with c los ed eyes  bec aus e I k new her  parents .  Did 
you 
like her ?  Is s he good
-
looking
?  H
e s aid
, ﬁ
Yes .
ﬂ
  
My hus band s aid yes .  So he c ame.  He did still not ask  
to marry me.  I thought now what I'm  going to do now? 
 
 
So I wen
t home.  Befor e I went h
ome
 
--
 
he invited me to his  hous e bec ause his s is ter  was  
hom e and the brother
-
in

law.  So I went to their hous e.  I s aw a ver y little hous e.  There were s even 
c hildren at hom e.  Six c am e hom e from the c onc entration c amp.  One was  killed in Budapes t, the 
younger  brother .
 
 
So he took me to the tr ain s tation.  He pr es ented me to the pr ies t, "This  is  going to be my 
futur e br ide."  Then I knew that I'm going to get mar ried.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  [Laughter ] 
 
But he did not get on his  knee to ask  m e to marr y him.  I would marr y him  
any way.  [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So, Anna, of cours e, you did marry him.  You had Alex and Andrew.  You would remain 

in Romania fr om 1945 to 1964.  Thos e were hard years .  You don't have tim e to tell 
us  about them  but 
one of the things that you s aid to m e was  that everybody was treated pr etty equally but onc e you were 
known as  wanting to leave, you were put on a lis t and things got ver y difficult but eventually you were 

able to leave Rom ania with yourfamily.  You were able to c ome to the United States.  Tell us  in the little 

10
 
 
tim e we have left what happened to your s is ter s.  It was  just the three of you.  Wher e did they go?  You 
all eventually
 
--
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Oh, yes, yes .  My s is ter got the pas s por t
 
before m e, my two s is ter s .  I r em ained with 
m y hus band.  Yes.  So after  we got m ar ried, we had two boys , Alex and Andrew.  Fr om Romania, they 
did not let out the J ewis h people only after  a while when Is r ael and Amer ica paid for  the pas s port.  So 
we have to stay for  19 year s  in Rom ania.  My c hildr en grew.  They had to go to high s c hool.  Bec aus e 

we wer e on the lis t that we wanted to leave the Com munis t Rom ania, lik e the Hungarians , they couldn't 
go to high s c hool. 
 
 
So finally we got the pass por t, left Romania in 1964.  At that tim e Alex was  14, Andrew was  
12 year s  old.  Not knowing the language, none of us , and with four  s uitc ases  they let us  out fr om 
Rom ania.  We c ouldn't bring anything els e from  there. 
 

 
We stayed in Italy for half a year .  Am eric a wanted
 
to c heck  us , if we were Communis t or not.  
So my c hildren lear ned a little Englis h ther e in the s c hool but we wanted to s ee Rome not
 
go to s c hool, 
m y hus band and I.
 
 
So after  s ix m onths ther e we arr ived in New York .  Bec aus e m y hus band and I did not know 
the language, we went to wor k  whatever  c am e.  He wor ked in the garm ent c enter in New York as a 
c utter  and I worked in a fac tor y putting zippers  in s mall jack ets.  When I got home, m y fingers wer e all 
bloody.  But we were fr ee.  And fr om  the m
oney that we earned, we c ould live.  The c hildren wer e very 
am bitious  in s c hool.  And we s tarted to live a good life. 
 
 
My hus band had a s ister her e.  Befor e us s he c am e her e.  So Alex bec am e an attor ney.  He's  
s itting ther e.  He's r etired.  Andr ew is  a geologis t.  I ha
ve four gr andc hildr en, one gr eat grands on.  And 
God bles s Amer ic a.  Becaus e they have us

helped us  to do that.

Thank  you.  Thank you.

> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Unfortunately we c an't do that.  But what we'd like to do is if you had a ques tion you 

wanted to ask, when Anna finis hes  her  final c omm ents and after we've taken a c ouple of photographs , 
pleas e feel fr ee to c ome up on the stage and talk  to Anna, ask  her a ques tion, get your  photograph 
taken with her, whatever  you want to do. We invite you

you will.
 
 
When Anna's done, Miriam, our photogr apher, is going to step on the stage here
,  
m om entar ily

and take a photogr aph of Anna with you as  the back ground.  It's  just a wonderful 
photogr aph.  So at that tim e we'll ask you to stand s o that it c ompletes  the pic ture, if you don't m
