s lide pr es entation to help with the intr oduction.
  
 
We begin with this s c hool portrait of Albert Gar ih taken in 1945.
 
 
Alber t's parents , Benjamin and Claire Gar ih, were born in Constantinople, Turk ey, but m oved 
to Paris in the 1920s.  Albert and his  twin brother, who died in infancy, were born on June
 
24, 1938, in 
Paris , joining older  s iblings J acqueline and Gilberte. We s ee all three s iblings, inc luding Albert with 
long hair, in this  1943 photogr aph.  Alber t's father wor ked in a garm ent factory and the family lived in 
the janitor's apartm ent ther e.
 
 
In May
 
1940, Germ any invaded Fr ance and oc c upied Par is .  The Gar ih family fled s outh but 
they s oon returned to Par is  where they were s ubjected to Franc e's  new anti
-
J ewis h legislation.  In 
1943, 
Albert's father was deported to a forc ed labor c am p and Alber t's m other and the c hildr en went 
into hiding with Madame Galop and her hus band for  the next six months.  When they r etur ned home in 

1944, polic e were s ent to arres t the Gar ihs  but agreed to s ay i
ns tead that the fam ily was  not home if the 
fam ily would leave im mediately.
 

2 
 
 
Alber t was  placed in a Catholic  boar ding sc hool for boys and his s is ter s  in one for gir ls  in a 
nor theastern s uburb of Par is .  When Par is was liber ated in Augus t
 
1944, Albert's mother  was  able to 
br ing her c hildren back  to the c ity.  Claire and her c hildr en ar e s hown together in this photograph.  
Alber t's father, releas ed fr om the labor  c am p, walked from Belgium  to Par is , returning to his  fam ily in 
Septem ber
 
1944, on Rosh Has hanah, the J ewis h new year.
 
 
The Garih family r em ained in Fr anc e after  the war. Alber t r ec eived his  Bacc alaureate degr ee 
in 1957 then ear ned a degree in Englis h and Spanis h to Frenc h tr ans lation from the Sc hool of 

Advanc ed Trans lation and Inter pr etation studies  at
 
the Sorbonne in 1962 and im m ediately began his  
c ar eer in trans lation, whic h he c ontinues  to this  day, 53 years  later .  His early wor k was  tr ans lation of
 
s c ientific  and tec hnic al doc um ents  and public ations  and later  trans lation of politic al and ec onomic 
doc um ents .
 
 
Alber t's wor k  took  him from  Fr anc e to Cameroon in Afr ic a, to Montreal and then eventually to 
the United States .  The organizations  for whic h he worked inc luded, am ong other s , the International 

Civ il Aviation Organization, the Inter
-
Americ an Developm ent Bank, the Wor ld Bank and the United 
Nations . His  work with the Wor ld Bank brought him  toWas hington, D.C. in 1976. His  c urr ent c ons ulting 

work is  for the United Nations .
 
 
In 1967 Alber t m ar r ied Mar c elle Ohayon who had moved to Franc e fr om Moroc c o in
 
1960.  
Alber t and Mar c elle have three daughters, J udith, Dalia and Noém i. Their thr ee daughter s have giv en 

them 11 grandc hildr en, 
 
 
For  pleas ure, he des cribes  hims elf as a r eal m ovie buff, loves  photogr aphy and to read, and 
he loves  to tr avel.  Alber t and
 
Marc elle went to China in 2012. he vis it the South Afric a in 2014.  This  
pas t s pring Albert traveled to Fr anc e, a ver y s ignific ant tr ip for him  that we will likely hear  m or e about 
today.  Albert s peaks  Fr enc h, Spanis h, Englis h and J udeo
-
Spanis h.
 
 
Alber t volunteer s her e at the Mus eum  with Vis itor  Servic es  working at the vis itor  des k  and he 
leads  tours  of the Perm anent Exhibition and the spec ial exhibition, "Som e Were Neighbors ." He als o 

gives  talks about his  pers onal exper ienc es  as  a child s ur vivor  at the Mus eum and around the c ountr y.
  
 
 
Alber t's c los e friends Is aac  and Aviva are here with him today, here in 
the front row.  
Welc om e.  We're glad to have you.
 
 
With that I'd like to ask you to join m e in welc oming our first per s on, Mr .
 
Albert Gar ih.
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Albert, welc ome and thank  you s o m uc h for your  willingnes s  to be our 
F
irs t 
P
er s on 
today.  It's good to have you here.  You have a great deal to tell us  s o we're going to jum p r ight in, I 

think .
 
 
WorldWar II began in September
 1
939 with Nazi Germ any's attack , invas ion of Poland.  The 
following May, 1940, Germ any attacked Fr anc e.  You were near ly 2 year s  old at that time.  Befor e we 

turn to the war years  and what it m eant for you and your fam ily, why don't we s tar t with you tellin
g us  a 
little bit about your par ents  and what their life was  like befor e the war  began. 
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  My par ents  were born in Constantinople, whic h bec am e Is tanbul later , in Turkey
, a
t 
the beginning of the c entur y.  The language was  J udeo
-
Spanis h.  Th
ey are Latino, pr operly nam ing 
Latino.  They lived there.  Turkey was  part of the Ottom an Empire whic h m ade the wrong dec is ion of 
s iding with Ger m any dur ing the Firs t WorldWar.  
 
 
So at the end of the war , the Ottom an Em pir e was  dis mantled and s trong m an 
c am e to power  
in Turkey by the nam e of Mus tafa Kem al Ataturk
,  
whic h means the father of m oder n Turkey.  And at 
that point, the J ews  in Turkey wer e not feeling quite c omfortable bec aus e they had s een what 

happened to the Arm enians .  Ther e was  a genocide of the Arm enians at the beginning of the c entur y.  

And then the Greeks wer e living in a port c ity in Turkey, fled, and went back  to Greec e.  
 
 
So the J ews  thought maybe they would be next, s o m y par ents
 
--
 
they were not m arr ied at 
that tim e.  They didn't know
 
eac h other when they lived in Turkey, but they both em igr ated to France in 
1923 Mus tafa Ataturk  c am e to power.  They s ettled in Fr anc e.  They m et in Fr anc e and got mar ried in 

1928.  My s is ters were born in 1930, Jacqueline and Gilberte, 1933, and I was  born in 1938.  I was  a 

twin.  My twin br other  died in infanc y at the age of 6 m onths. 
 

3 
 
 
At that point, m y par ents, you know
 
--
 
the r eas on they c am e to Fr anc e is quite logic al bec aus e 
they wer e educated in Turkey, in an inter national organization that was  s pons oring s c hools all over  the 
Ottom an Em pire where educ ation was  given in Frenc h.  So m y par ents  were perfectly fluent in Frenc h.  
It was  the s ec ond tongue to them next to J udeo
-
Spanis h.  And they har dly s poke
 
--
 
they s poke very  
br oken Turkis h, ac tually.  S
o when they dec ided to leave Turk ey, Fr anc e was  a natur al destination for 

them.  That's when they emigrated in 1923.
 

 
My father was  working as  an acc ountant in a garm ent factory.  He was  doing the payroll, 
ac tually, of the em ployees  ther e. We were not very r ic h to s ay the leas t.  My father  was  wor king two 

jobs  at the s ame tim e.  He was  working full
-
tim e dur ing the day in that garm ent factor y and he was  
r unning another job, going to a m ovie theater  in one of the m ain areas in Paris .  The m ovie theater, he 

w
as  tearing tickets  at the entranc e, like you have people doing that.  So he was  r unning two jobs at the 
s am e time.  And m y m other stayed hom e bec ause s he had to r ais e three c hildr en, three young 
c hildren.
 
 
The garment factor y wher e m y father  was  wor king, t
he owner of that factory was  J ewis h.  He 
allowed my father  and my fam ily to live in the janitor 's apartm ent of the hous e, of the factory.  We wer e 
s or t of the c oncierge of the factory, ac tually, to s ave on the r ent.  So I tell you, it was  not wealth or 
any
thing like that.  We wer e rather  poor , ac tually.  So m y father  was  r unning two jobs and on to
p of that 
he was  s aving on the 
r ent.
 
 
We stayed like that until 1939, even later .  In 1939, the war  br ok e out, firs t in Poland.  In 
May
 
1940 there was  the invas ion
 
ofWes ter n Europe, inc luding Fr anc e.  And at that point when Paris  
was  invaded, when Franc e was  invaded in J une
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you go on to that, let m e jus t ask  you a c ouple of ques tions .  What was  your  
par ents' c itizens hip s tatus ? 
 
> > Albert
 
Garih:  Good ques tion.  My parents  had lost Turkis h c itizens hip at that time.  They were 
s tateles s.  My father  had s tar ted the pr oc es s  of getting a Fr enc h natur alization but at one point in the 

`
30s , for  whatever  reason, all the applic ations  were fr ozen so they were s tateles s , whic h m eant that 
they wer e m or e expos ed to danger than Frenc h Jews .  I'm going to explain that.
 

> > Bill B ens on:  A little bit later.  Ok .
 
 
Another  ques tion.  You were born in 1938.  That was  a year that was  pivotal to the power of 
th
e Nazis .  Your parents  des c ribed
 
--
 
or you desc ribed that as an ominous  time.  Do you think 
1938
 
--
 
do you have any idea if your  par ents were really s c ared or  frightened about what the futur e held 
as  you wer e c oming into their life? 
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  I don't k now.  I never asked them  about that but I think  they m us t have been 

c onc er ned about, you know, the wave of anti
-
Sem itis m and all the meas ur es  that were taken in 
Germ any to deprive the J ews  of their bas ic  rights.  But in Franc e we wer e not yet affec ted
 
by that.  It 
c am e a little later when Fr anc e was  invaded.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Whic h was  May
 
1940.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  May
 
1940.  In J une
 
1940, there was  a battle.  The French Arm y was  defeated.  The 
new government
 
--
 
the Fr enc h governm ent r es igned and a new gover nm ent was  form ed under Mar s hal 
Petain, her o of the Firs t WorldWar, a notorious  anti
-
Semite and c ollaborationis t.  They form ed th
e 
gover nm ent.  They
 
--
 
the statute
 
of the J ews  bas ed on the
 
Nur emberg Laws  depr iving J ews  of mos t of 
their basic rights . We had the s ame r ules starting in 1941.
 
 
In 1942
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we go ther e, I'm going to s tay back  in 1940 for  just a little bit.
 
> > Albert Garih:  Yes ?
 

> > Bill Bens on: When Ger m any invaded Fr anc e and
 
as  they advanc ed on Par is , there was  a m ass  
exodus  of people fleeing Par is , per haps  as  m any as  80% of Par is ' population.  You s aid to me that for  

your  fam ily, quote, it all began with the exodus  fr om Par is .  Tell us  about the exodus  and what that 
m eant fo
r your family
, w
hat the exodus  was , s o people unders tand. 
 
> > Albert Garih:  When the Germ an Arm y de
feated 
the Fr enc h Arm y in June
 
1940, and they s tar ted 
m ar c hing
 
--
 
they marc hed into Par is , ac tually.  The people of Par is got s c ar ed.  They all fled s outh, 

4 
 
towar ds  the South of France.  Fr anc e was  divided into two zones .  You had the oc c upied zone in the 
nor th and the free zone in the s outh.  The new gover nm ent s et s hop in Vic hy, under  the dem arc ation 
line in the free zone.
  
So a lot of people tried to c ros s  that line but m y parents  didn't go that far.  
Ac tually, my father didn't even leave
 
--
 
he stayed in Par is . We fled with m y m other.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You left.
 
> > Albert Garih:  My m other , sis ter s  and I, we fled.  We went down to the River  Loire whic h is  fa
mous  
for its  beautiful chateau.  We s pent a few nights  in the c hateau.  But it was  m or e s leeping on the floor , 

on s tr aw.  I was  2 years old.  It was  J une
 
1940.  I was  jus t 2 year s  old.  And my m other  had nothing to 
feed me.  I was  crying all the time.  I was  bothering all the people who were ther e.  At one point my 

m other  told m e
 
--
 
all I am telling you now about that per iod is  what I got fr om  m y m other.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  She s aid that I was  bother ing people s o m uc h that at one point
 
ther e was  a soldier, 
one of the Frenc h s oldiers  who had fled, es c aped being taken pris oner, gave her a bottle of Sc hnapps  
and s aid "Give him s om e Sc hnapps
.  T
hat will c alm him down."  So I had my first s hot of Sc hnapps  at 
the age of 2.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bi
ll Bens on:  My im age of the exodus  is  what we've seen in movies , and that is  thous ands and 
thousands  of people fleeing on bikes, in c arts , in car s .
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  It was  a total c haos.
 
> > Bill Bens on: With Ger m an planes  diving in. 
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Ge
rman planes , Italian planes  strafing people.  Actually, that's  how my mother  lost her 
m other , grandm other , a brother , a s ister, and two nephews  when a bomb fell on their c ar on the bridge 
c r os s ing over  the River Loir e.  That was  the fir st tragedy that s tru
ck us , ac tually, dur ing the war
, m
y 
m other  lost her  mother
; 
I los t m y grandm other
 a
nd an unc le, aunt, and cous ins .
 
 
Eventually, having nowher e els e to go 
--
 
we didn't have any c onnec tions outs ide the c ountr y, 
didn't have any money so eventually we went back  hom e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you were des c ribing for us  the divis ion between Vic hy, Fr anc e, and oc c upied 

Fr ance.  So you returned to Paris .
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  We r etur ned to Par is in the oc c upied zone.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What did that m ean, the oc c upied zone?
 

> > Albert Gar ih:  The occ upied zone m eant it was oc c upied by the German Army. We had Germ an 
s oldier s  all over  in Fr ance, in that part of Franc e, ac tually.  So it was  ver y s c ar y.  And the Germ an Ar my 
was  impos ing demands under  Vic hy gover nment.  They s tar ted rounding up people.  In 1941 they 

s tarted rounding up people.  That star ted in 1941 and las ted until 1944, actually.  76,000 J ews  wer e 
deported that way.  They wer e arr ested, r ounded up, arr ested, and s ent to Aus c hwitz
 b
y way of transit 
c am p in Par is , north of Par is .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Until that tim e when the mas s  deportations  began in the sum m er  of 1942, you 
c ontinued to live with your  fam ily in their apartment during that time.  Right?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes .  But in J uly
 
1942, that's when it started to
 
get wors e.  Ac tually, that's when the 
bigges t roundup of all, wher e 13,000 people were r ounded up and s ent to Aus c hwitz inc luding 4,000 

c hildren who didn't c om e back.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Until that tim e was  your  father  able to c ontinue to work and feed your  
family?
 
> > Albert Garih:  My father  was  working, yes .  But it was  getting wors e and wor s e.  For ins tanc e, the 
fac tor y wher e m y father was  wor king, his  bos s was  J ewis h s o the fac tor y was  confis c ated.  They put an 
Ar yan m anager.  My father's bos s had to go into hiding
, actually. 
 
 
So at that point we had to vac ate the apartment, the janitor's  apartment, and wer e to find an 
apar tm ent in no tim e, in J uly
 
1942 fr om  then on all I am  going to tell you is  my r ec ollec tion bec aus e I 
r em em ber viv idly when we m oved int o that tiny apar tm ent I still remem ber the wall paper  on the walls , 
ac tually. 
 
 
So, yes , we had to
 
--
 
at that point with people being rounded up all the time, m y par ents  were 
very c onc er ned.  They wanted to pr otect us  fr om the danger of being arr ested
 
and 
taken away.  They 

5 
 
s ent us to a
 
far m outs ide of Par is  in a plac e whic h today is  famous for the park.  It was  farmland.  My 
s is ter s and I s pent the fall and winter of 1942, 1943 on that far m.  That farm  was  run by two ladies .  I 
never s aw any m an in that far
m .  I gues s  the men
 
--
 
m en may have been taken.  Maybe they were 
POWs s om ewher e.  I never  hear d
 
--
 
I never  s aw any man in that far m.  It was  only two ladies .
 
 
My s is ters  would go to sc hool.  I r em em ber  that winter was  very c old.  We had a lot of s now.  
A l
ot of s now.  I was  s taying behind
 
--
 
I was  4 year s old.  So I was  s taying behind with the two ladies
 
w
hile m y s is ters wer e going to s c hool.  And m y parents had not told the ladies  that we wer e J ewis h.  
They jus t s aid that they put us ther e in or der  for us  to be better  fed.  You k now, ther e were s o many 
r es tric tio
ns .  Ever ything was  r ationed: br ead, butter.  Butter was  a luxury item.  So m y par ents us ed that 
pr etext to s ay we are going to s end our  c hildren to a farm  wher e they ar e going to be better fed.
 
 
And ac tually, we were.  It was  not exactly c lean but it was
 
--
 
we wer e not hungry ther e.  Thes e 
people were r ais ing
 
--
 
thes e two wom en were rais ing pigs, I r em ember, and r abbits.  It was  fas c inating.  
I was  fas c inated, playing with the rabbits  in their boxes .  That's what I r emember.  But, you know, as 4 

year s  old, I had no idea what I s hould say, what I s hould keep for mys elf.  And onc e in the c onver s ation 
I told the ladies  that we wer e J ewis h.  And thes e ladies  didn't want to have anything to do with the 
Jews 
or  anything.  Maybe they  were not anti
-
Sem itic but they wer e afr aid of the danger s  of hiding J ewis h 
c hildren s o they s ent us  right back  to our par ents .  That was  in the s ummer of 1943.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you're back in Par is .
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Back  in Paris  in this  tiny apartment.  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One of the things  you mentioned is  how s c ar y it was  for your parents bec aus e the 
r oundups  wer e going on, partic ular ly it was  danger ous  to go on the Metro, the train.  You told me about 
one partic ular  i
nc ident.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  That inc ident, that's s omething that m y m other told me bec aus e I had no rec ollec tion.  
I mus t have been too young for  that.
 
 
One day s he had to r un an err and into Par is .  We were liv ing in a s uburb adjac ent to Par is, 
about one mile away from  Par is.  One day s he had to go into Paris and we had to take the s ubway .  It 

was  very danger ous  for J ews  to be c aught in the s ubway bec aus e if ther e was an identity c heck and 
they would find on your  identity c ard that there was  a J or m arks J ewis h on it, they would take you r ight 

away, put as ide and s end you 
to 
a tr ans it c amp and fr om ther e to Ausc hwitz.  And one day my mother  
had to take me on the s ubway.  When we got to the end of the line, ac tually, ther e was  an identity 

c heck.  So that m eant
 
--
 
whether  it was  Fr enc h polic e
 
--
 
it was  probably Fr enc h polic e or  m ilitia, whic h 
is  even wor s e.  The militia, they were vehemently anti
-
Semitic, thes e people.  So they were c hecking 
identity.  So m y mother  took  me in her ar ms and pr etended s he was  looking in her pur s e for identity 

c ar d.  She walked between two guards.  They didn't s top her.  If they s aid, 
M
a'am , I want to s ee your  
papers , I wouldn't be here today.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So s he was  able to es c ape.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Somehow
 
--
 
s he walked between
 
two guar ds and s he managed to es c ape that way.  
But that was , you know
 
--
 
I don't know what to c all it.  I don't like to us e the wor d m irac le but to me it's 
alm os t mir ac ulous that she was not stopped.  As I s aid, you know, other wis e I wouldn't be here tod

> > Bill Bens on:  As you said to us earlier, by that tim e thous ands  and thous ands  of J ews  had been 

taken and deported fr om Paris .
  
In September
 
1943, your father  was  tak en for forced labor in the 
Channel Is lands between England and Franc e.  Soon after that your  m other, s is ter s  and you went into 

hiding.  Tell us what you c an about your father being taken and being forc ed to go away and then about 
your  mother 's effor ts to find hiding plac es for you.
 
> > Albert Garih:  My father  was  s ummoned to go to a s lave labor c am p off the c oast of Norm andy, 
ac tually between the Channel Is lands .  It was  between the Fr ench and Britain, actually.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Germ ans  had oc c upied those is lands .
 

> > Albert Garih:  The Channel Is lands  was  the only Britis h terr itor y un
der  Germ an oc c upation.  The 
Germ ans dreamed of tak ing over Gr eat Br itain but they never did.  All they c ould do was  to bom bard 
London
 
--
 
but they took  thes e ter ritories .  They wer e building what they c alled the 
Atlantic Wall
 
to stop 

6 
 
an invas ion fr om the Allied For c es at that point.  So m y father was  one of the s lave laborers who was  
working on the 
Atlantic  Wall
.  He ac tually had a ter rible ac cident when he was  ther e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we talk about that, you rem em ber  him  leaving.
 

> > Albert Garih:  Oh,
 
yes .  Yes , yes , yes .  Actually
 
--
 
I was  a kid.  I was  5 year s  old at that time.  My  
father had been given a gas mask.  They had the rec ollec tion of the Firs t WorldWar wher e they wer e 

us ing gas  in the tr enc hes.  So m y father  had a gas m ask.  I r em em ber  as
 
a c hild 
--
 
it was  put in the 
bathroom .  I us ed to put it
 
--
 
I us ed to play with that gas m ask.  So when he left, he had to take his  gas 
m ask  with him  and we walked
 
--
 
as I s aid, we were living about a m ile away fr om the Metr o station.  
There was  a bus taking us  ther e but we didn't tak e the bus . We walked all the way to the Metro s tation 
to s pend a little m or e time with my father .  I r em ember when he left, he took  the Metro and he went.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did he or  your  m other
 
--
 
do you k now if they had any idea wher e he was  going? 
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  I don't k now.  I c ouldn't
 
--
 
I don't know.  All I know is  that in a way in his  m isfortune he 
was  very for tunate to end up in this Channel Is lands  bec aus e if he had been s ent to the east, to 
Eas ter n Europe, he probably would not have s ur vived.
  
In that c am p he managed to s urvive.  
 
 
Although, as I s aid, he had a terr ible ac c ident.  He fell off a c liff at one point.  He was  injur ed 
on the head.  He was  left like that.  He fell off a c liff.  There was  a sc affolding. 
 
He stepped on a loose 
bolt and the bolt c ame r ight to hit him and he fell down the c liff.  He was  pic ked up a c ouple of hours  

later by the s oup truck .  My m other when s he hear d about that, s he thought we would not s ee our  

father again.  But m y father  was  a very s tr ong man, muc h s tronger than m e, ac tually.  I don't think  I 
would have s ur vived the exper ienc e that he went thr ough but he did s ur viv e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you and your fam ily walked your  father to the Metro for him to leave to go into 

s lave labor, your  m om is  now alone with thr ee c hildren.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Thr ee childr en.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What happened then?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  She was  terr ified bec aus e s he k new they were r ounding up people.  They c ould come 
at any mom ent, in the m iddle of the night. We would hear the boots of the Germans or the Fr enc h 
polic e banging at the door and taking people away.  That's how they would do that.  So s he was  
terr ified about that.
 
 
One day, s om etim e, you know, s he m et this  lady at the str eet m arket.  She thought s he c ould 
open up to this  lady.  She told her her  story that she thought we might be taken away at any m om ent.  

This  lady, M
adam
e 
Galop, went back  hom e, told her  hus band.  The hus band the next day c ame with a 
c ar t and we took  whatev er  personal effects  we could with us  and we went to live with the Galop fam ily, 

in a sm all hous e, ac tually.  We s pent about s ix, seven m onths with them.  
 
 
And that was c ur ious ly enough the happies t tim e I had during that per iod. 
 
The Galop fam ily 
were abs olutely c har ming people.  They wer e a pr otestant family.  They had two daughter s .  I was  5.  

The two daughters  wer e 4 and 3.  So I had playmates .  Gabr iel, Mons ieur Galop was  a s c ulptor.  He 
was  making s ets for  m ovie s tudios .  They had a warehous e in the back of the hous e wher
e they were 
s toring all of these m ovie s ets.  They wer e great hide and s eek  parties
 
there with the two little gir ls.  
Monsieur was  very funny.  He was  always  telling a s tor y.  He had this  very war m  ac c ent, s outher n 

ac c ent of Franc e.  They were abs olutely d
elightful people.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  the r isk  to them for  taking you in? 
 
> > Albert Garih:  I don't k now exac tly how muc h r is k  they were taking but, you know, when people wer e 
c aught hiding J ews , either  they might end up being deported with the J ews
 
or they m ight be exec uted.  
And they had two young daughter s, two young c hildr en.  Thes e people were abs olutely her oic .  To m e, 

this  is  beyond belief, actually.  I c an't im agine.  I have wondered very often s inc e then whether I would 

have had the c ourage 
to do what they did for  m e
f
or  other people.  You know, that's  a big c hallenge.  I 
don't know.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you wer e s aying to m e before we s tarted, bec aus e you were s o little, you wer en't 
awar e of the ter ror as  muc h as  the adults  were.  What was  that time like, do you think, for  your  mother, 
living in hiding with the Galops , and your father's  gone?
 

7 
 
> > Albert Garih:  My m other  was  in c onstant fear  of us being denounc ed, you know, repor ted by some 
neighbor s.  We wer e living in a small
 
--
 
you know, the
 
Galops  wer e living in a smaller  str eets.  There 
were about 10 hous es  ther e.  It was m ostly artis ts, painters , s c ulptor s, and the Galops.  One of the 

ar tis ts , a painter , his  wife was  a s ym pathizer of the Reic h
, a
n anti
-
Sem itic .  One day s he went to the 
Gal
ops  and s aid, "When ar e you going to get rid of that s c um ?" We wer e the s c um.  At that point we 
had no c hoic e but to go back  home. We c ouldn't s tay with the Galops anymore.
  
So we went back  
hom e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Back  to your apartment?
 
> > Albert Garih: 
 
To the s m all apartm ent, yes .  And s ure enough, a few weeks later , a bang on the 
door .  It was  always  ear ly in the mor ning.  I don't know why.  8:00
 
in the mor ning.  I was  s till in bed.  I 
was  jus t about 6 at that time.  It was  in J une
 
1944.  Two Fr enc h po
lic e ins pec tors.  "Madam  Garih, we 
c am e to take you away."  I c an't im agine my mother 's
 
--
 
legs s tar ting to s hake.  "Don't be afr aid. We'r e 
going to report that we didn't find you.  But you mus t leave your apartment imm ediately bec aus e we're 

going to repo
rt we didn't find you.
ﬂ
  
They'r e going to s end
 
--
 
whether it's  the other  polic e or  the Gestapo, 
I don't know who, they're going to put s om e s eals on the door.  If they find you ther e, they're going to 

take you away. 
 
 
So I was  awakened by the c omm otion, actually.  I was  s till in bed.  My mother  dres s ed me 
very quic kly and with m y s is ters we went out. We went to s ee a s oc ial wor ker .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you tell us about this, why  do you think  they did that r ather  than take you as 

they appar ently had come to do?
 
>> Alb
ert Garih:  You k now,
 
that's  s omething that I ver y often wonder ed, whether  thes e people were 
r eally hero
e
s  or jus t pragm atic and were realizing that they had lost the war
 
--
 
Fr anc e had lost the 
war
 
--
 
Germ any had lost the war and they were on the wr ong s ide.  I don't know.  I don't know what 
their motivations wer e but I know that other people were ar res ted the s ame day, actually, and never  

c am e back.  I don't know what was  the motivation of thes e people.  All I know is  that's what they told 
m
y m other, you have to find another plac e to s leep
; y
ou c annot stay in your  apar tm ent. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So your  m other, who is  alr eady ter r ified, now it's even wors e.  They've c om e and said 

you've got to get out of her e.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Can you imagine the adr enaline at that point?  Yes .  It mus t have been pum ped up, 
ac tually.
 
 
So s he went to s ee this soc ial worker  who told her a story.  The s oc ial work er s aid, you know, 
I need a few days  to find a plac e for  eac h one of you, a hiding plac e for  eac h one of
 
you
 b
ut in the 
m eantime you mus t not s leep in your apartment
; t
r y to s ee if you c an s leep at your  neighbor's .  That's 
what we did.  Ac tually, we had next door neighbors , a c ouple
 
--
 
it's funny.  The Galop fam ily was  a 
pr otestant family.  This  couple next 
door wer e a Com munis t c ouple, work er s .  They had a little 
daughter, about m y age.  My mother  and I, we s lept in their  apar tm ent.  My  s is ters  s lept downs tair s  at 

the lodge
 
keeper™s
 
apartment.  The lodge keeper
 
was  als o a woman
 
--
 
her hus band m ust have been 
als o am ong the s oldier s  taken pr is oner .  I never saw a m an ther e.  She had three c hildren
:  tw
o s ons  
about 13 and 12 and a little gir l about 5 year s  old.  And my s is ter s  s lept at the lodge
 
keeper
™s
.  And we 
s lept at the inn next door.  
 
 
It was  c onvenient.
  
They were work night s hifts .  She was  a pr inter, working pr obably for a 
news paper .  I don't know exac tly.  So s he was  working at night.  So we would s leep in their bed during 
the night.  And in the mor ning when they would come back , we would leave their bed and they would 
go to s leep.  So we stayed like that for a few day s .  I c ouldn't tell you whether it was  a week.  I don't 
know.  A few days .
 
 
After a few days , the s ocial wor ker c ame back  to my mother and s aid, ok , I found a plac e for 
eac h one of you.  And my m other was  plac ed as a governes s  in a fam ily of eight or 10 c hildren.  There 

was  a bunc h of c hildren in that fam ily
, n
ear the Eiffel Tower, actually, in the heart of Par is .  I'll c ome 
bac k  to that later.  We were put in a Catholic  boar ding s c hools  in a s ubur b northeas t of Paris, 

Montferm eil.  
 

8 
 
 
Montferm eil was  made fam ous  in "Les Miserables
.
" 
 F
or thos e of you who may have read "Les 
Mis er ables ," that's where J ean Valjean meets Cosette when s he goes  to get water at the
 
well.  That's 
wher e we s pent the
 
s umm er of 1944. We wer e in Catholic  boarding s c hools .  So as I s aid, we were 
hidden by a pr otes tant family a Com munist couple, and then Catholic  boar ding s c hools .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you and your s ister s were not in the s ame s c hools .
 
> > Albert Garih:  No.  My  s is ters  wer e in a boarding s c hool for gir ls  and I was  in a boar ding s chool for 
boys
 b
ut in the s am e ar ea, in the s am e s ubur b, Montfer m eil.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Up until that tim e when now you'r e all in hiding in differ ent plac es , had your  mother  

been able to m aintain c ontac t with your father at all? 
 
> > Albert Garih:  While we were in the boarding sc hools , we had no c ontac t with my father.  But before 
that, yes .  Actually, in that c am p it was  not as  bad as  in the death c amps in Poland or  anything like th
at.  

They do c orr es pond.  One of the pic tures  that you s aw of m y m other and m y s is ters and m e was  taken 
in the quar ter  in Paris .  And m y m other
 
--
 
that was  another one.  The other one wher e m y m other was  
s itting and I was  with my s is ters and m y m other.  She had this  pic tur e taken by a photogr apher becaus e 

in this  thos e days  we didn't have c am er as . We didn't have s m artphones or anything like that.  We 
c ouldn't take pic tures .  A c am er a was  a luxury item .  Ok?  So we had to go to a photogr apher to have a 
pic t
ur e taken s o that s he c ould s end it to m y father who was  in c aptivity.  So they c ould cor r es pond.  
And I s till remem ber the letter s  that we r ec eived from  him.  I still r em ember vividly the s tam p
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Postage m ark?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  The s tam p
 
whic h was  with the eagle and the s was tika.  I was  fas c inated by that.  I s till 
r em em ber thes e letters.  I don't know for what r eas on.  My parents  got rid of them.  They threw them  

away.  I would have loved to have them  to be able to give them to the m us eum.  Unfortunately they 
dis appeared.
 
 
But, yes , I rem em ber.  We wer e able to c ommunicate.  But when we wer e in the boar ding 
s c hools , we had no c ontac t with our m other.  And m y mother  was  taking care of eight or 10 c hildren in 

that fam ily and s he c ould not get in touc h with her own c hildr en.
 
 
And m y m other was  on the fr ont r ow to witnes s  the liberation of Par is.  The liber ation of Par is 
took plac e in Augus t
 
1944
.  
Augus t
 
25, 1944, Paris  was  liberated.  Ok?  My mother was  on the fr ont 
r ow.  She s aw the fights  between the German Arm y and the res is tanc e, the underground.  There were 
s om e people who wer e k illed in the s treets .  She c ould s ee that fr om the windows .  We w
er e in that 
boar ding s c hool in the s ubur b east of Paris .  So we wer e liber ated a few days  after Paris. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before talking about liberation, do you know anything about what your life was  like in 
that Catholic  boar ding s chool or  what your  s isters' life was  like, wher e they wer e? 
 

> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes .  I have a better  m emory of that
, m
y life in that boar ding sc hool than my s isters .  
My s is ters  wer e c omplaining.  Appar ently there wer e s om e fruit tr ees in the backyard of the sc hool and 

they wer e not even allowed to pick up the fruit.  And the fruit would fall and r ot on the ground and they 
were not allowed to eat them .  And we wer e s tarving, you know, all the time.  We wer e always  s tar ved.
 
In my c as e it was  not any better.  We didn't have fr uit trees  s o we didn't have that problem but I 
r em em ber the food was  terr ible.  I r emember partic ularly the rotten beans.  We were fed r otten beans .  I 
was constantly sick, actually.
 
 
One day I had a feas t.  The pries t in that Catholic  boar ding s c hool was  s uffer
ing fr om a s ort of 
c anc er , stom ac h c anc er or  s om ething like that.  They managed to get a c ouple of potatoes  and a little 
piec e of butter and they m ade him s om e m as hed potatoes .  And even that he c ouldn't s wallow.  So I 
was  fed the leftover s of the pr ies t's
 
m as hed potatoes .  That is  a feast.  And to this  day I love m as hed 
potatoes.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Albert, do you know from what you've learned fr om your  par ents later that when you 
were in the Catholic  s c hool and your  s is ter s were in the s c hool they wer e in, who knew that you wer e 
J ews  in thos e s c hools ? 
 
> > Albert Garih:  I don't k now but I s us pect that the head m is tres s  in the boarding s c hool wher e I was  
knew and maybe als o the priest.  They wer e probably the only two who knew.

> > Bill Bens on:  The other  students wouldn't know.
 
> > Albert Garih:  The other  students knew nothing.  I had lear ned my les s on.  I didn't s ay anything 
about that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you had the ear lier  time.
 
>>
 
Albert Gar ih:  Yes .  The head mis tres s  was  ver y nic e to me.  I have fond memories of that.  I would 
have loved to have her recognized as  a r ighteous am ong the nations but unfortunately I tr ied to find her 
nam e and I c ouldn't find it.  I was  the youngest. 
 
I was  jus t 6 year s  old.  The c hildren were 7 to 14.  I 
was  really the youngest.  I alr eady knew how to write and r ead at that tim e but s inc e we wer e in the 

s am e c las s , with differ ent rules , different gr ades so I was  with the babies  and I was  doing s trokes
 
like 
that when I c ould write and read, actually.  But they didn't want to m aybe em barr as s  s om e older 

c hildren, I don't know, but they put m e with the babies  doing s tr okes. 
 
> > Bill Benson:  So Augus t
 
1944, Paris  is  liberated.  Your  mother's  liber ated befor e you are.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on: What did your m other do then?  Now s he's  liber ated. What did that mean?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  As  s oon as  Par is  was  liber ated and the train s ervic e was r estor ed, m y m other was  on 

the fir s t train to c ome to s e
e us .  And c urious ly enough
 
--
 
it's  s trange how a young c hild may quick ly 
forget about his loved ones, actually.  One m or ning
 
--
 
well, befor e I tell
 
you
 
that, I want to tell you how 
we witness ed the liber ation.  Bec aus e a few days  after Par is , we were liber ated.  We learned about that 

by one of the s tudents  who had run away from the s c hool and c ame back  and s aid
, 
"The allies ar e 
c om ing."  So we all went on the 
m
ain 
s
tr eet and we s aw the jeeps, the tank s , the s oldiers with different 
helmets.  It was  not the Nazi helm et.  And friendly fac es giving us choc olate, giving us  c hewing gum , 
even c igar ettes.  Not to me, but.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had to be 8 for  that.  Right?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yeah.  [Laughter] 
 
Anyway.  So that was  one of the m ost wonde
rful mem or ies  that I 
have from that per iod.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you told m e that
 
--
 
you had hear d of the Br itis h and you had hear d of the 
Rus s ians  but you hadn't even hear d of Am eric ans.  Right?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  No.  I had no idea who the Am eric ans  w
er e.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They s howed up.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  I heard about the Rus s ians, the Germ ans, of c our s e, the Italians , Britis h, the Frenc h.  
The Am eric ans ?  Where do thes e people c ome from?  I had no idea.  But needles s  to s ay I fell in l
ove 
with them right away, ac tually.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So, your mother c om es  to get you.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  So as  soon as  the train s ervic e was  r es tored, my mother was  on the first train.  She 

c am e.  And one m orning after we had been liberated,
 
m y s is ters c om e and we wer e in the playgr ound 
in fr ont of the s c hool and it was  hot.  I was  ver y weak .  I had no str ength, ac tually.  I rem em ber
 
--
 
I'm 
going 
to 
s par e s om e details  but s ometim es  I didn't have time to go to the bathr oom whic h was  on the 
oth
er s ide.  So I was  in bad s hape. 
 
 
Any way.  There was  a sm aller s ide door on the wall to the boar ding s c hool and I s een m y 
s is ter s.  They c om e and they s ay, "Gues s who is  her e."  I was  6 years old.  I had forgotten about my 
m other .  Thinking
:  W
ho c an be here?  So I m ove m y s is ter, I pus h my s ister as ide and I s aw m y 
m other .  Then, of c our s e, I jum p into her arm s.  
 
 
But, you know, I was  not thinking about m y mother  anymore.  I was  6 years  old.  It was  a new 
life for m e.  My m other was  no longer part of m y life.  I had to readjust.  Of c our s e, it was  ver y quic k  and 

very eas y but for a while I was  not thinking about m y m other.  When they said "Gues s  who is  her e," I 
had no idea.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you said to us, you had been s tarving for  s o long and now you'r e in ver y poor 
s hape.  What happened to you?

> > Albert Gar ih:  Well, my m other when s he s aw us  and s aw m e partic ularly, I was  par tic ularly skinny, 
s he took  me home r ight away.  The next day s he went to pick up m y sis ters .  When s he c am e, s he had 
the r ati
on stam ps , coupons , actually to buy bread.  She bought a loaf of bread with the r ation tickets  
and we s wallowed the loaf of br ead in no tim e.  We were liter ally s tarved.
 
 
So s he took me right away hom e.  Of c ours e s he had nothing at hom e.  We didn't have a
ny 
r efr igerator.  A refr iger ator  c ame m uc h later in this  our lives , ac tually.  So we had nothing.  The only 
thing we had was  a gr een apple.  I was  left under the s uper vis ion of our next door neighbor, the 
Com munis t lady.  She had the key.  I just finished eating the apple and I was c leaning m y teeth lik e that 
with m y finger s  and s he s aid, "What did you eat?"  I s aid, "I didn't eat anything.."  She s aid, "No.  You 
ate s omething":  So s he found out.  She was  appalled bec aus e
 
--
 
I was  very weak and I had c ons t
ant, 
you know, s tom ac h ups et.  So that was  the las t thing I s hould have eaten but it was  the only thing that 
was  available.  So I ate it.  We s tayed star ved like that for s om e time.  But ever ything was  rationed, for 
m any year s , actually, even after the war
. 
 
 
I 
r em em ber, for ins tanc e
 
--
 
I'm a trans lator.  The Frenc h gover nment wanted to or der  s om e 
wheat to make br ead bec aus e we had stale br ead
; 
it was  dark br ead, it was  s tale.  They even s aid that 
they wer e m ixing s awdus t with the flour.  It was  terr ible.  Anyway.  The Frenc h governm ent plac ed an 

or der for wheat to c ome fr om the s tate.  But you k now, from  England, wheat is  c alled c or n.  So they 
plac ed a huge or der of cor n.  So we had mais  instead of wheat and for  s ix m onths , m or e or les s  for s ix 

m onths, we had m ais  bread.  It was  yellow br ead.  I rem em ber it was not ver y good but it was  s till better  
than the dark bread that we had during the war .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Albert, your  father, of c ours e, he had been s ent away.  So in September
 
1944, after  
liberation, I
 
think  that's  when your father was  able to c ome back .  Tell us  what happened to him.
 
> > Albert Garih:  Yes .  My father was  in the Channel Is lands .  Somehow
 
--
 
the allies , when they wer e 
pr epar ing for D
-
Day, they wer e trying to c onvinc e the Ger man Army that
 
the invas ion would take plac e 
in the Str aits of Dover, the s hortes t dis tanc e between Britain and Fr anc e, about 25
 
m iles , 35
 
kilometers, 
s o they wer e bom bar ding there.  So what happened is  in May
 
1940, just one m onth befor e D
-
Day
 
--
 
or 
1944, I mean, May
 
19
44, they evacuated the inmates  from  the is land and m oved them to the Straits  of 
Dover .  
 
 
I r ealized that s ever al years  later , I would s ay even dec ades  later
.  
I remember my mother 
m entioning in the convers ation at one point dur ing that tim e that they had 
bom bar ded Boulogne
, a city 
near  the Str aits of Dover , and s he m us t have known that m y father was  ther e at that tim e.  To m e, I jus t 
r ealized, put two things together, and I c ould figure out.
 
 
So my father was  in that r egion of Calais  and B
oulogne 
and ther e
 
were c ons tant 
bom bar dments .  My father  told m e at one point when there was  a bom bardment, they would lay flat on 
ground and ther e was  a raid and there was  a bombar dm ent, they were str afing people.  When the raid 
was  over , my father got up and there was  a German s oldier next to him who didn't get up.  He was  
dead.  He had been killed.
 
 
I would s ay ar ound the end of Augus t, when Par is was  liberated, the Ger man Army was  
m oving
 
--
 
the allies  were pus hing eas t towar ds  Germ any and the Ger man Ar my was  m oving back
.  A t 
one point they put all the inmates  that they had in the Straits  of Dover  on a tr ain bound for Germ any.  
We don't know whether  they would have us ed them in s lave labor, fac tor y in Ger many, or m aybe they 
would have been s ent to a death c amp.
 
> > Bill B e
ns on:  Right.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  I don't k now.  Maybe that would have been a m or e likely alternative bec aus e they 
were not in good s hape so m aybe they would have exter minated them.  
 
 
They were on a train.  The tr ain was  s topped in Belgium  by Belgium 
partis ans , r es is tanc e, 
underground.  They had blown up the railr oad or  s om ething.  There was  a battle.  And in the c onfus ion 

the Germans releas ed the inmates .  There were 900 and a few m ore on the train bound for Germ any.  
They were released.  That was  in norther n Belgium .  So they had to walk ac ros s Belgium to Fr ance.  It 
was  about 200
 
m iles .  He arr ived the m or ning

> > Bill Bens on:  He walked that whole dis tanc e?

> > Albert Gar ih:  He walked.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And he is  not in good s hape. Was  he?
 
>> Albe
rt Gar ih:  No.  He was  not.  He was  not at all.  As  I said, he had this bad fall and he was  s ewn, 
you know.  To the end of his  life he had big s c ars .  He was  bald, s o you c ould s ee all the s c ar s  on his  
head of his  injuries  dur ing that per iod. 
 
 
So he walked all the way  from northern Belgium to Par is .  He arr ived the m or ning of Ros h 
Has hanah.  Rosh Has hanah is  the J ewis h new year.  My m other was  dr ess ing us , you know, for the 

fir s t tim e we were going to go to the s ynagogue for  Ros h Hashanah for the s er vic e. 
 
Onc e again at 
8:00
 
in the m orning
 
--
 
this  time it was  a happy time.  We had a knock  on the door.  It was  my father.  It 
took m y m other a few s ec onds  to rec ognize him.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  She had no idea he was  c om ing home of the r ight?
 
> > Albert Garih:  No, no.  She knew, yes .  My father  was  s ent to that c am p with a c ous in of his.  His  

c ous in had c ome back alr eady.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Albert Garih:  So his c ous in told my m other that m y father was  on his  way home but s he didn't know 
when he would s how up. 
 
So he c ame back the mor ning of Ros h Has hanah.  He was  in terr ible s hape, 
of c ours e.  He was  like a skeleton but he s urvived.  
 
 
That's it.  That's  the whole s tor y about our family.  We wer e reunited.  The fam ily was  intac t.  
As  I s aid before, m y m other los t her m other, br other, s is ter , and s ome nephews  plus  s om e c ous ins  who 
were taken to Aus c hwitz who never c ame back .  But our nuc lear fam ily was  intact.  My father, mother, 
s is ter s and m e, we s urvived. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you were liber ated, when your father  c ame home in the fall of 1944, of c ours e, 
the war c ontinued until May of 1945 s o it went on for  a good while longer .  Were people afr aid that the 

Germ ans m ight c ome bac k  o
r did
 
you
 
feel c om pletely liberated at that tim e?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  You k now, as
 
I s aid befor e, I was  too young to be afraid.  So I don't r em em ber  that we 
had that fear that they m ight c ome back.  I thought pretty muc h onc e Par is  was  liber ated, for  us  the war  
was  over .  The war  was over  in 1944.  And October
 
1, 1944, was  back

s c hoo
l day and I was  all too 
eager to start at the age of 6 to go to elementar y s c hool.  I was  a highly motivated s tudent.  My

[Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to ask you one m ore que
s tion
; t
hen we'll have tim e for a few questions  from  
the audienc e.  J us t a few months  ago or in this  s pr ing you returned to Fr anc e.  Tell us  about that.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes .  Ac tually, I wr ote a story about that.  It was  a tr ip down m em or y lane.  I went 
to all 
s or ts of plac es  in Fr anc e.  Firs t of all, m y
 
nephew is  an interpreter in Paris .  He had been hir ed by the 
m em or ial in Paris  for a confer enc e that inc luded a vis it of the trans it c am p from where the people wer e 
s ent to Ausc hwitz.  So he invited m e to
 
join him to that vis it.  So I vis ited.  Then when I visited m y sis ter  
in the c enter of Fr anc e, she was  living not far  fr om
 
Or adou

s ur

Glane, 
 
a sm all village whic h was  
c om pletely destroyed by an SS divis ion, tanks.  They wer e going north.  It was  after D
-
Day.  They wer e 
going north to fight the allies .  And on their way they s topped in that village.  They killed everyone in the 
village and they put ever yone in the c hurc h and they s et the c hur c h ablaze.  They burned the whole 
village.  And today this  village r em ains  as it was  after that.  So it was  r eally down mem ory lane.
 
 
But then fr om  ther e I went south to the South of Fr anc e.  I was  reunited with the 
granddaughters  of the Galop family.  The Galops  were no longer alive and neither were their two 
daughters
 
who were my playm ates during that period.  They both pas s ed away a few years  ago.  But I 
was  able to rec onnec t with their da
ughters , the grand
daughters of the Galops .  We had a beautiful 

r eunion ther e.  They had br ought s ome pic tur es  from  that per iod of t
heir grandpar ents, their par ents 
and m others, ac tually.  Thes e wer e the two girls  that I was
 
playing with at the age of 
5.  They were the 
mi
ddle of the righteous .  I m anaged to have the Galop fam ily, the next door neighbors, the Communis t 
neighbor s, rec ognized as  righteous  among the nations .  So they c ame to s ee m e and they br ought the 
m edal.  It was  a ver y emotional m om ent.  Ac tually. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm glad you were able to do that.  I know you told m e on the phone that was a very 

em otional, profound experienc e.
 

12
 
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  A ver y m eaningful moment, actually.  They wer e eager to hear bec aus e they didn't 
know muc h about the details , how their grandparents , what the
y had done.  They k new that they had 
taken a fam ily in hiding and they knew they had been rec ognized bec aus e there was  a c er em ony.  It 
was  in 1992, 23 year s ago, in the South of Fr anc e.  And they were there.  They wer e m uc h younger.  
I  
had never  been in touc h with them  s inc e.  So they were eager  to hear more about how we lived dur ing 

that per iod.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were able to give them a firsthand ac c ount of what happened.
 
> > Albert Garih:  Exac tly.  For  them it was  very meaningful and for m e it was  nice to be able to s how 

s om e gr atitude.  My gr atitude has not dim inis hed over the generations.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Let's  turn to our audienc e for a couple of ques tions .  If you have a question, we'r e 

going to hand you a mic rophone.  If you'll us e the m ic rophone,
 
pleas e, make your question as s hort as 
you c an.  If need be, I'll repeat the question to m ake s ure ever ybody in the r oom  hear s  it befor e Albert 
ans wers .
 
 
We have a hand up right her e.  Here c om es a mic r ophone to you.  
 
 
Thank  you, Mitc h.
 
>> 
What were your
 
interac tions , if any, with s oldier s  of the Frenc h
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Interactions  with s oldiers of the Fr ench r es is tanc e? 
 
> > Albert Garih:  In exis tenc e.  You know, first of all, the people who were in the r es is tanc e, it was  a 
s ec r et Arm y s o they wer e not public izing their  actions  or  anything like that.  So, no, I didn't k now 
anyone in the r es is tanc e.  
 
 
But, ac tually, the Communis t neighbor had been s um m oned to a m ilitar y labor s er vic e in 
Germ any and he had not r epor ted for  duty s o he was  als o wanted by
 
the Ges tapo.  So he was
 
--
 
that 
was  his  form of r es is tance.  And the Galops  family by taking us into hiding was  als o a form  of 
r es is tanc e.  But that's the only c ontac t
 
I had with r es is tanc e
 b
ec aus e the people who were fighting, the 
par tis ans, fir s t of all, they wer e not
 
--
 
as I s aid, they were not public izing. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.  
 
 
A c ouple questions  r ight down here and then one over  there.  We'll get a mic r ophone to you.  
Pas s  that down.
 
>> 
Do you have any mem or ies  of, lik e, bom bs falling or 
thos e terrors that you see in films, for example, 
Ar m y dr agging people away or bom bs falling fr om  the sky?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  I don't have m em ories of s eeing bom bs  falling from the sk y but I have m em ories of 
r aids .  When ther e was  a raid, we had to go to the s helters . We had the s iren that was  blas ting, 
announc ing the r aid.  So we had to r un into a s helter.  And I remem ber once I was  walking in the street 

in Par is , we wer e walking, and ther e was  a r aid.  And that was  very dangerous  als o bec aus e you had 
peop
le in plain c lothes  who c ould stop you, gr ab you like this, ask  for your paper s.  If you s howed the 
paper, identity c ar d with a J  or  J ew marked on it, they would put you as ide and s end you to Aus c hwitz.  
It was  very dangerous.  That's what I rem em ber.
 
 
I a
ls o rem em ber that when I was  in that boar ding s c hool, we would go down the underground, 
the bas ement, of that school, ac tually.  And one of our  favor ite games , at the end of the r aid, onc e the 

s iren was  blas ting again to announc e the end of the raid, one o
f our  favorite games
 
--
I  
was  not the only 
one who did that
 
--
 
was  to go to the playgr ound and pick up s ome s hrapnel.  I had a big c ollec tion of 
s hr apnel that my m other  hur ried to throw away when we got hom e.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  But I had this .
  
I r emember they were very s car y.  You know the fr enc h fries, like an 
ac c ordion
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Cr inkles.
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  About that big.  It was  c as t ir on.  It was  ver y heav y.  If you get one like that in your 
body, you were in bad s hape.  So, yeah
.  That's  what I remem ber about the r aids .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Several hands  up.  I think we c an get a c ouple mor e in here.  Mitc h, you rais ed one 

r eal quickly.  I'll get you.  Then I think , Claire, c an you go here in the thir d row?

Let m e just m ention that
 
when we're done here, Albert will s tay behind and abs olutely c om e 
up and ask  him questions  bec aus e we're not going to get to all of you.
 
 
Alber t, you'r e prepared to s tay and ans wer ques tions .  Abs olutely.
 
 
Go ahead.
 
>> 
So you wer e ins ide dur ing this period but how long did it take to go on with your  life after  that?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How long did it take for  you to get on with your life?
 
> > Albert Garih:  It c am e back ver y quickly.  As I s aid, Oc tober
 
1 was back
-
to
-
s c hool day.  I was  all too 
eager to start 
a normal life.  So when I went back to s c hool at the age of 6, to me
 
--
 
but I remember 
May
 
8, 1945, whic h was  the end of the war , the capitulation, unc onditional c apitulation of the Reic h, the 
s irens  blas ted als o.  It was  11:00
 
in the m or ning.  I was  playi
ng downs tairs  with s ome fr iends.  I was  
weak.  I was  not ver y fast
 
--
 
I was  not a s peedy r unner but I r emember
 
--
 
we lived in a long building, like 
that.  We were at the end of the building.  And I rac ed with a fr iend of m ine who was  muc h faster than 
m e and that day I beat him .
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok . 
 
> > Albert Garih:  That I rem em ber .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you. 
 
 
Yes ?
 
>> 
I was  jus t wondering, ther e ar e many people like you who wer e killed and they are not alive today.  
So what do you think was  the key that you are alive now?  Maybe you're luc ky or it was  just 
ac c identally?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Let me repeat that.  Maybe everybody didn't hear that.  The ques tion was :  You 
s ur vived.  Obvious ly many, m any other s  did not.  So what would you attr ibute your s ur viving to?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  That's a ques tion that I've asked mys elf very often.  Why me?  Why not this  little guy?  
Why not
 
--
 
and how many little guys  who would have been m aybe geniuses , you know, would hav e 
m aybe given a lot m or e to the wor ld t han I ever  did
?  Why
 
didn't these people have a c hanc e to 
s ur vive?  That is  one ques tion that is  always  bothering m e.  I always  wonder  about that.  But I was  
luc ky.  They were not. 
 

> > Bill Bens on: We'r e going to stop now bec ause it's tim e to end our pr ogram.  We will end in a few 
m inutes with Alber t c los ing our progr am.
  
I want to thank  all of you for being with us  today.  I remind you 
we'll have a
 
Firs t Pers on
 
pr ogram  eac h Wednes day and Thur s day until the m iddle of August.  So I 
inv ite you back if you c an do it or look  to our pr ogram again in 2016.
 
 
It's  our  tr adition at
 
First Per s on
 
that our F
ir st 
P
erson has the last wor d.  So Alber t will c los e our 
pr ogram . When he's done s peaking with his  las t wor d, Mir iam , our photogr apher right her e, is going to 

c om e
 
up on s tage and she is  going to take a pic tur e of Albert.  I'm going to ask you all to r is e when s he 
gets  up her e becaus e we'd lik e to have a picture of Albert with you as  the bac kdr op.  It's very s pec ial.  

We'd like that very muc h.  Again when we'r e done, Albert will r em ain behind up her e.  So we inv ite you, 
pleas e, if you have questions , and s everal of you had ques tions we c ouldn't get to, c om e up on s tage 

and talk to him  or get your  pic tur e taken with him , just s ay hi, whatever you want to do when he 
fi
nis hes.
 
 
Alber t?
 
> > Albert Gar ih:  Yes .  Som etim es  people ask m e why do I s peak  at the mus eum. What is  m y 
m otivation about that?  I think  the ans wer is  you jus t have to look at the situation of the world today with 
the terroris m all over, people being decapitated in front of c am er as and things like that.  I think we ar e 
not out of the woods  when it c omes to atroc ities and all of that.  It's  ver y important to pass  the mes sage 

of the danger s o that people are aware of what is  going on and m obilize in order to fight agains t thes e 
danger s .  That's one of the r eas ons why I'm s o eager  to s peak to you and to other  people. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you, Albert.
