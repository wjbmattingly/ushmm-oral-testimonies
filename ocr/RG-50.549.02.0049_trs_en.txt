Q: Okay. What -- You mentioned in your firs
t interview that you 
moved to  Belgium -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- up -- a couple of  years after you 
were born. Why did you family move from 
Czechoslovakia to Belgium? 
A: I really don™t know. Children were not info
rmed. I -- I -- Lot of -- There were a lot of 
immigratio n into Belgium to wo
rk the coal mines and the -- I 
think my  father mu st have 
ended up in a steel factory. Why, exactly, I 
think -- I really don™t know, I mean, we never 
ask, we were never told, so I really don™t
 know wh at the reason was. But instead of 
coming to the States, we just 
-- we moved to Belgium, I guess.
 We went to Belgium on -- 
we arrived in Liège, Belgium, on May eight,
 1929. I came to the States, landed in New 
York , on May eight, 1946. 

Q: Do you -- Do you do anyt
hing special on that date, or 
do you always remember when  
May eighth rolls around? 
A: I reme mber May eight, because the war started about that day. The Germans invaded 
Belgium. Yes, I remember May eight, becaus
e that™s when I lan -- I always remember 
May eight, when I landed in th
e State ands can™t forget it. 
Q: Do you do anything to memo
riali -- anything kind of -- do you
 have any kind of ritual 
that you do to memorialize that, o r is it 
just something that you rememb er and keep  

[indecipherable] 

A: That just something 
I reme mb er. No, I don™t do anything sp ecial, no.

Q: Okay . Had your family had a long history 
in Czechoslovakia, in 
S a latv en -v en a, b e fo re 
you left? 
A: My grandparents came from Salitva, on both si
des. Both my parents came from that 
city and all the f -- so far as I know, from bot
h sides, mo ther and fa
ther, they both were 
from that town. I don™t know 
where they came from before, my son is trying to find 
ancestry and so far, on my  father™s side, he 
can™t -- on th e Ad ler, he cannot find anything. 
There are only four of us left
 on my father™s side. Two cous
ins in Belgium, one male, one 
female. One in Israel, he was bo
rn there, on my father™s y
oungest brother, and me in the 
States. On my mother™s side, 
there are quite a few cousins 
all over. One of them was in 
Equador, died about a year ago. Canada, th
e United States. They™re
 all over and I -- I 
didn™t know most of them, until 
I came to the States an d then 
they came later than I did, 
but some in Israel, they™re about all over, on
 my  mo ther™s side. But no one seems to be 
able to tell me where we went 
back further. I tried to find ou
t what my grandparents died 
of, but by the time it d awned on
 my  to find out, all the peop
le from that ag
e -- from that 
era, were gone, so I have no idea. I think I 
was told my  mo ther™s 
father, after World War 
One, develops wa -- wa -- I don™t know wh at ki
nd of disease, diphtheria, whatever went 
around. I understand he worked for the railroad, that™s all I know. But we di -- we don™t 
know.  

Q: What were your -- your parents names, 
and -- and what did they do fo r a living? 
A: My mo th er™s maiden name was Esaacovic, and she learned man™s tailoring wh en she 
was a young girl, that much I know. My fath
er -- they were orphaned, they were both 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

orphans when they were
 married. My father, I understand, came from a very poor family. 
There were seven children left, and th ey did th
e best they could, I guess, to support the 
children. On ce you were poor, you were poo
r, I guess, there. And maybe that™s what 
brought them to -- you know, what -- that™s wh
at made them -- wha -- to go to  Belgium, 
and I -- he -- I know he lost his -- his job and 
I think he was in a stee -- in a -- a steel 
factory, because Belgium had that coal mines 
and steel factories. And then my  -- what 
my  mo ther did, she picked up th e tailoring, 
but they -- she did it at home, and she did -- 
she worked for several tailors and made the pa
nts. They cut and then we used to roll it up 
and bring it to the house, and -- and then ev
entually, she brought in somebody to  help 
with the sewing, is the way -- 
and my father slowly did -- 
you know, yo-you iron with a -
- with an iron that was heat -- that was heat
ed. And he did the heav y work  for her. And he 
eventually went into that, becau
se after the war, that™s what 
he did. My father™s brother, 
one of the younger brother, also
 went to Belg ium, and he was a tailor. And I guess he 
went into  business after the war, to manufactur
e, instead of individual suits, that they 
went into  manu -- quote, manufacturing, not to
 the -- to the extent that it was in the 
States, but that™s what they 
did is, they went into manufact
uring men™s clothing, is what 
they did. 

Q: So, your family was somewhat struggling 
financially, in those early years, is that 
right?  

A: As far back as I can remember. We didn™t
 feel it. I had wonderful parents, I -- they 
w o rk ed  v e ry  h a rd , my
 mo ther work ed very long hour
s and I rememb er wor -- I guess, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

during th e -- what you call season, she work ed 
very , very  long hours, is -- is what I 
remember. We -- If w -- If they 
struggled financially, we di
dn™t get the brunt of it. I 
mean, I can™t place my self missi
ng anything or -- or -- or bei
ng in need of anything. My 
father had a sister who did men™s shirts, you 
know, individual. All our clothes were made 
by dressma k ers. The suits were made by my
 uncle, and she -- I re
memb er my  aunt did 
nightgowns for us. So, we were very well 
dressed, I don™t reme mb er ever hav -- going 
hungry, so whatever
 they did, th ey provided
 for the children, we didn™t feel any need, or 
any loss, or -- or -- I don't recall anything like that. 
Q: You mentioned the importance of their lo -- 
of your parents love and support for you, 
in helping you get through, afte
r the war. What were their wishes for you, or what were 
their -- what do you think their goals were for you as -- 
A: Yeah, I didn™t want to -- I didn™t want to 
go to school. We didn™t have to go to high 
school, and I wanted dressmaking and dress de
signing, and they  insisted that I get a high 
school diploma. So I was forced in going in to  high school. And in -- when th e Germans 
invaded in 1940, they -- in 
Liège, I found out in -- I ta
lked to someone who was from 
Antwerp they started sooner. But in Liège, 
wh ere we were, they -- I continued going to  
school until 1942, and I -- just before I was to 
graduate, get my diplom
a, that™s when they 
start -- they didn™t allow Jews
 to go to school, and -- but wh
en the war started, my parents 
kind -- bent, and I stayed in the same school
 that I went -- wha -- what do you call it? 
Instead of going at -- academically, I went 
into a school where I was taking pattern 
making and dressmaking. They  said -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

Q: Vocational s -- 
A: The vocational school, they  said it™s all 
right, as long as I get a high school dipo -- 
diploma, is -- is what happened. And I reme
mber, couldn™t get fabrics, because it was 
war, and I remember d istinctly, my si -- my 
middle sister had entered high school, and I 
took a coat that I had, took 
it completely apart, pressed, 
laid it flat, and learn -- and I 
made a -- cut the coat to fit her, to learn to
 ma ke it. So I did not get my  high school 
diploma, but I was just before graduation, so 
I was able to go to school. And then -- We 
spoke Yiddish at home, of course, until my pa
rents learned French and even after that. 
We had a private tutor that cam
e and taught us Yiddish, and I us
ed to write the letters to 
the rest of the family, I guess, in Czechoslova
kia, but I don™t remember how to read, or 
how to write Yiddish . I speak it,
 I understand it, but I can™t -- 
no longer read or write it. 
Q: So when you lived in  Lièg
e, did you speak just Yiddish 
and French, or did you sp eak 
any other languages? 
A: No, no, f -- Yiddi -- We -- We spoke 
Yiddish and French. My  parents spoke 
Hungarian when  they  didn™t want us to 
understand something. Otherwise, they -- 
Otherwise they -- what we -- we spoke Yi
ddish, I mean my -- my parents came from 

Orthodox background, and in 
Salitva, I guess the way of life was the -- th-the way of 
Jewish life in the calendar and ev erything. 

Q: Will you tell the names of your -- your two 
sisters, and -- and tell us something ab out 
each of them? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

A: Okay, my middle sister is Berta, she was 
-- we were two and a half years apart. She 
was -- loved dancing and whatev er, but my  pare
nts didn™t go for the arts, for some reason 
or other. They felt education, 
that did not include it. And 
my little sister, Nellie, I don™t 
know wh at was wrong with her, 
I know she was very fragile at first, and of course, being 
the youngest, she was spoiled. 
That™s how I remember, I  used 
to get angry at her, because 
everything I did, she wanted to do. I didn™t lik
e chicken so up, so if I didn™t eat it, she 
didn™t want to eat it, an d I was told that 
I would get it for both of us, because she did 
everything I did. I was a very 
finicky person, even in thos
e days. For instance, I had a 
bicycle, and Berta had a bicycle, and then she outgrew that bicycle, it went to Nellie, so 
she -- Berta and I had to share a bicycle and 
if it rained on it, I would wipe it and take 
care of it and sh e was ma -- much
 more li -- much more rela
xed about it. She was a very 
warm, very outgoing person. That™s 
-- That™s about all I can tell you. 
Q: Okay, I™m just going to ask some ques tions about -- about th
e chronology of your 
wartime ex periences. Okay, we know that th
e Germans invaded in ™40, and that from -- 
that -- that there were restrictions and so
 forth, and -- instituted sometime after the 
Germans started -- after the Germans occupied
 Belgiu m and Liège. And then , in 1942, 
you just mentioned that you -- you stoppedhigh school. And then  at some point, you 
mentioned in your first interv
iew that your father was calle
d to Dunkirk, to -- to build -- 
A: Well, we do -- that™s -- that™s was the rumor. 

Q: Okay . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

A: The first thing th ey did is call young people.
 I looked at -- at -- in
 an encyclopedia in 
the library and they did not 
mention the -- the -- the f -- th
e young people, because the 
two very close friends I had we
re called. And then later, th
ey called men between certain 
ages, I -- I don™t rememb er. And the rumo r was,
 I don™t know how true it was, that there -
- we™re going to build fortifica
tions in Du nkirk. Whether that was true or not I don™t 
know. And my father was called, and I™ll neve
r forget him because it was a Saturday and 
I can see my father coming up the stairway, we
 lived on a -- above a -- a business, and he 
had his hair shaved, and my  mo ther said -- 
asked him where he wa
s going, and he said, 
ﬁI™m going to report, because they say if th
e men go, they won™t touch the rest of the 
family.ﬂ And my  mo th er said, ﬁI don™t believe
 them, I don™t trust th
em.ﬂ And that™s when 
they decided -- it was a matter th
at I remember, of either tryi
ng to go acro
ss to France, 
which was very serious, because my cousin -- 
I -- my father™s sister
™s boy, who was eight 
at the time, his mother had died, the father ha
d remarried, and his wife ha -- his -- th-the 
woman he had remarried brough
t -- sh -- he™ll -- he left th
e woman with two children and 
she brought my  cousin to us, so there were 
six of us to cross a border. You had to pay 
somebody to  get you across. You didn™t know if
 you would make it. And th en they turn ed 
to this Catholic family and 
that™s how we got the house wh
ere we went into hiding.  
Q: Okay. So, your father just di
d not -- he evaded the call to go? 
A: Right.  

Q: You wanted to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
10
 
 
 
A: Yeah. [inaudible]. Yeah, th
at, see? According to my notes, 
it star -- it started -- th-they 
called it a labor draft. I didn™t know at the 
time that™s w h at it was called, and it was in 
July, 1942. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And d -- as a matter of fact, the couple who 
came in to join us in hiding afterwards, he 
was a friend of the family, he was the same 
age as my  father™s brother, who had also 
moved to  Belgium, and she had wo rked  for 
my  parents in, you know, helping with the 
sewing. He had gone on the train. 

Q: And what was his name? 
A: Shlumalvit -- shl -- sh -- his name was Ya
nkel Sh lumavitch, Jacques. And they had a 
little boy, a b -- a baby, I don™t even think he 
was a year old. She was five years older 
than I, and -- and he went on th e train and th
en this is how we knew -- I guess I don™t 
know to -- at which point we -- we went in
to hiding and I guess the 
-- the conductors, the 
people who worked on 
the train -- don™t forget these we
re Belgian citizens, opened the 
doors and said, ﬁYou™re going into,ﬂ -- I thi
nk Germany, or Poland, it was before they 
entered Germany -- ﬁwhoever wants to run, 
run.ﬂ And a lot of the young man who had 
gone, got off the train and went into 
hiding, but my father hadn™t gone. 
Q: Okay . So, Yank
el Shmulavits -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- was married to Rasha? 
A: Rachelle -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
11
 
 
 
Q: Rachelle. 
A: Y -- That™s right, you are right. 
Q: Okay. And -- And yo-you all we
nt into hiding at -- in this -- 
A: They joined -- Rachelle and Jacques and th
e baby joined us to -- i-i-in hiding. They 
were in the same house, we were in hiding. 
Q: Okay . And do you -- the -- the Catholic  family to whom the home you -- you were 
staying in belonged, do
 you know their names? 
A: No, it -- the person who got -- who got us th
e house, okay -- we lived across the street 
from a church. Now, that part of Belgium is 
very, very Catholic, an
d there was a family -- 
it™s a long story -- one part -- one memb er of 
the family lived upstairs of us, and they 
were very close with the church. I mean, 
there ™s Catholic, and, you know, no matter 
which religion, and wa -- one of the -- one of
 the sons was a Trappist. One of them had 
gone i -- was in the service, but came back 
and had gone to the country, and my  parents 
turned  to these people, and the one who had 
gone to th e country knew about the house. 
The house belonged -- The hous
e belonged to a -- was a guard  house for the castle. And 
we -- I don™t know if these people knew we
 -- we occupied, you know, if the owner™s 
knew, that I don™t know. I know -- I reme
mber, somehow or other f -- I knew that we 
paid the rent for six months. And after that, 
I don™t know what happ
ened, I don™t know if 
we didn™t pay or anything, because I-I really 
-- I really cannot tell you, it was not brought 
up, so -- I did -- we did not know who -- we 
never met, we never knew who the people 
who owned the land, because it was on land that
 belonged -- is it a -- was it a count or a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
12
 
 
 
duke? I really -- I really can™t remember, beca
use we never met him, didn™t even know he 
-- I don™t ev en remember their name. I don™t even 
know if they knew, at first, if it was a 
Jewish family. I don™t know ho
w we got the house, I don™t 
know what information they 
gave us. The farmers around us, in no time 
at all, they knew we were Jewish. I mean, 
there was no -- no way of -- of hiding it, but as 
far as the owners, I have no idea, no idea. 
Q: Was there a name of -- of the town  wh ere you were staying? 

A: Yeah, Gomzayodomon, yeah, Gomzayodomon. 
Q: How far was it from Liège? 

A: You know, that™s a good qu
estion, I don™t know. We used to ride it by bicycle, my 
sister and I used to go in to Li
ège by bicycle, and when  I went later on and became a maid 
in the city, that™s how -- that
™s why I went -- did 
not go out with my  fa
mily. I used to go 
home by bicycle. It -- It was hard becaus
e it was hilly, but otherw ise, I don™t know. I 
really, really -- I never looked into it, neve
r asked. You know, we didn™t ask questions, I 
never -- even when I went back, I never aske
d how far it was. I did go -- I think I wen -- I 
don™t rememb er if I went by bus, or if my  un
cle had a car and took me there. I don™t even 
reme mb er. But, you know, Belg ium is a small c
ountry , so -- at the -- at
 the time it seemed 
big, but it™s a small co untry, next to this one.  

Q: And you were staying at this 
place for 22 months, is that right? 
A: Well, I was not there the whole time, because
 I eventually went to
 Liège, some -- into 
the home of -- this woman was a widow to  
a coal mining engineering -- engineer. And 
she had a son who was an Ob/Gyn, and he wa
s about 40 years old,
 and you know, they  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
13
 
 
 
used to receive patients in their home, a
nd they needed a maid
. So, they knew I was 
Jewish and I went to Liège, and walked arou
nd with a false ID, went home, traveled by 
bicycle and I was there wh
en the Gestapo came -- 
Q: Okay . 
A: -- to arrest the family.  

Q: And do you know -- reme mb
er their name s, the name  of the -- of the woman and the 
son  
A: [indecipherable] Dr. Bastin, 
B-a-s-t-i-n, I think, yeah. 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah. 
Q: All right. And so that was the son, and then -- 

A: And -- And the mo
ther, yeah, yeah.  
Q: Okay. So, somehow I™d seen
 the figure of 22 months -- 
A: Well, we were in hiding 22 months from 
the time we went -- that -- that the -- the 
Germans started deporting the Jews from Li
ège until -- until liberati
on in September, so 
you count 22 months, is the way they co unted it. 
Q: So, it was around July ™42, til around May -- 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: -- May ™44? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
14
 
 
 
A: No, the allied troops came into Brussels, in
 September 1944. I remember it was just 
before my birthday, yeah. So I think the -- 
I think that whoever -- whoever counted  the 
hiding, they  figured 22 months. That
™s all -- That™s all I know, yeah. 
Q: So, do you have a se
nse of the approximate time when 
you started to wo
rk  as a ma id  
for the -- for the doctor? 
A: I -- I was 16 years old, I remembe
r, because three days before my 17
th
 birthday, wh ich 
is September 14, I was allowed to go home 
every other weekend, meaning Saturday to 
Sunday, that was my ti
me off. And I -- of course, I trav
eled by bicycle, and I don™t know 
what the trucks ran on, but not on gasoline a
nd they were very slow
 going up the hills, it 
was a butane -- whatever comes -- smoke comes 
out of there, and it was -- we all did this, 
we hooked onto the truck. You know, it was an 
open ta -- panel truck. I™ll never forget it, 
I had a -- a skirt and blouse on, the -- the skirt,
 we used to call it jep aison, it was gathered, 
something like a trundle skirt and it had a bi
b, you know. And I -- 
There were two -- was 
it one or two guys on th e back of the truck, 
and it had like a pole, and I hooked on with 
my left hand, to the pole, to go up the h
ill. And the wind was blowing, and my skirt 
caught on to the truck, and I gu
ess I lost -- I got panicky, I di
dn™t want to tear the skirt, 
don™t forg et you -- you couldn™t -- you couldn™
t replace clothing, and I fell to my  right 

side and broke my  right collarbone. And they
 put me on the truck and I rememb er saying 
very distinctly in Fren
ch, for some reason or other, this 
sticks very clear in my mind, I 
said, ﬁDon™t let me die three days before my
 birthday.ﬂ So I knew I fell September 11, 
that™s how I remember. And th
ey brought me home and I had 
to stay home and all they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
15
 
 
 
did is take gauze bandage and put my  arm --
 you know, no sling, no 
anything, and I have 
picture, I think they  took it wh en they did the --  
Q: Mm-hm, yeah -- 
A: -- yeah -- 

Q: -- it was on your video -- 

A: -- yeah, and -- 
Q: -- yeah. 
A: -- that -- that -- that wa 
-- that was in September, yeah. 
Q: 1942, it would have been, righ
t? That was going to  be your 16
th
 birthday? 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no. Th
at mu st have been ™43, because you know, I didn™t keep 
track of wh -- of when we went, I -- I never 
knew that these things were going to come 
up, but no, I was in the house at
 first, for quite a long time.  
Q: Yeah, okay. 
A: And I was 16 -- between my 16
th
 and 17
th
 birthday that we were in there. 
Q: Okay. So that, when you
 broke your col-collarbone a few days before your 17
th
 -- 17
th
 
birthday? 

A: Three days before, I say, ﬁDon™t let me 
die three days before my birthday.ﬂ That I 
remember distinctly. 
Q: And you didn™t get any 
medical treatment at all? 
A: Yeah, there isn™t anything they can know, I 
ma -- my bone -- my bone is still not set 
right. I don™t feel it, I have no pain. I was told  that I would suffer the rest of my life with

arthritis. I don™t even  know that it™s broken. 
I don™t feel it, I don™t know. I think it™s not 
until year -- not that many years ago th at they
 came up with something to  set collarbones, 
there isn™t much 
they could do. 
Q: Okay, that -- that makes it cl
earer, and then -- let me just pause for a second. As far a -
- d-- so you mentioned that you 
had false identification papers? 
A: Yes. 

Q: So did you have ex tensiv
e contact with the undergro
und while you were there? 
A: I? No. I think my father did, from what 
came up afterwards, but we were not told. I -- 
I don™t know. I don™t know, everything was d
one to protect the ch
ildren and I guess they 
didn™t tell us too much. All I -- I -- I really
 don™t know, because you know, it™s not like 
today wh ere the kids know everything, and 
-- but we didn™t know, I don™t know. I -- I 
have a feeling th at my father, I-I -- I don™t know
, he either went to the farmers to get food 
for the underground -- I really couldn™t tell 
you, I have no idea of wh at my  fa-father 
might have done or not 
done, as far as the underground. I have no id ea. 
Q: Okay . You got word  at so
me point, that your mo th er 
and your sisters had been -- 
A: Arrested. 

Q: -- deported -- arrested. You -- At that tim
e, I assume you were working as a maid, 
still? 
A: Yes, I was -- I was in Liège, I was with
 Madam Bastin, the do -- and Dr. Bastin, and 
that was the weekend I was to
 go home. And I got a call, a
nd it was code -- a coded, so 
they didn™t say the Gestapo arrest your fa
mily, cause you had to be careful what you

talked on the phone. And I di
d understand wh en they  told  
me not to go home. And my  
father was in the hospital, that™s w hy my 
father was not deported. And I™m trying to  
think. I have to remember in 
French. Hopital de Labarvare, 
I think it™s called, and he had 
entered the hospital on Friday. He had either an
 ear infection, an eye infection, I don™t 
know, and th e doctor felt he should go in the 
hospital. And my  sister Berta was supposed 
to bring in shaving cream and 
soap, you know, they
 didn™t provid e them. And I got ahold 
of Dr. Bastin, of course, and he had my  father
 released from the hospital, and we got on a 
bus to go home, to go b
ack to that -- to the house, and 
that™s when we 
found out exactly 
what happened, they ca
me at five o™clock in  the mo rni
ng. And the farmers tried to save 
the children, my mother tried to
 save the children. From one of
 the farmers we -- we were 

told that one of the Gestapo as
ked my little sister -- and they 
didn™t ask -- he asked -- they 
ask where my father was, and my little si
ster answered, ﬁHe™s in the hospital.ﬂ I 
understand he slapped her beca
use she was lying, which was the truth. That™s what we 
got from the farmers w ho were there. 

Q: Was it a farmer who had called to -- to
 give you in  code, the info rmation? 
A: No, no, I -- you know, I cann
ot -- it sounds terrible, I ca
nnot rememb er who called me. 
It might have been th e same 
man who help ed us with the pa
pers. I really don™t know, I 
cannot remember who calle
d me, cannot remember. 
Q: Okay. Going to f
lip the tape over. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

Q: This is tape two, side B, of an interv
iew with Frida Wallenste
in. And -- And th en you 
mentioned in your video interv
iew, it™s -- le -- correct me if
 I™m wrong, but it sounded as 
if the Bastin -- Dr. Bastin, and -- and Mada
m Bastin, thought that it was too dangerous 
for you to stay with them any more.  
A: [inaudible] 

Q: And then  you went -- yo -- did 
you -- wh ere did you go from there? 
A: I went -- I went, very temporarily with 
Monsieur, Madame Liba
re. They ha -- They 
were the ones we communicated with w-whil
e my  -- my  -- you know, while they were all 
in the citadel, on the outskirts of Liège. There were packages that went and notes slipped 
in. Don™t forget the -- the civ
ilians worked and went back an
d forth and they were very 
anti-German. And I went there, but at that ti 
-- I don™t know, I must
 have stayed a very, 
very short time, maybe a couple 
days. Monsieur Libare had been
 called to go to wo rk to  
Germany, because they were losing on the Ru
ssian front at the time, and they called -- 

we™re talking Gentiles, Catholic where I was, 
to go to work the fact
ories. They needed 
manpower while their man went on the front. 
And wh at happened is these -- these men -- 
my father was also called on his false ID wi
th it, and the -- I guess, quote, the mayor, 
from the village, who had -- where -- we had 
ID™s where we were registered in the 
register, so in case they
 took the ID™s, they could check 
we were there. He notified them 
that they made a mistake on 
my  father™s age and made -- they made him 10 years older, 
so he didn™t go. Bu t, wh at happened with th
e other people, and in -- like with Monsieur 
Libare, the -- the man would go on the train, 
hand in their papers, 
a-an-and get off the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
19
 
 
 
other side of the train and go
 home. So you had a lot of th
e Gentiles, who were, quote, 
hiding, th -- i -- were n o t legitimate -- were -- 
were hiding at home, so when I went there, 
they were afraid they would 
co me for him and find me, or th
ey™d come for -- for me, and 
f-f -- and -- and you know, find him, 
so I stayed there, and then -- 
Q: Were they in Lie-Liège? 

A: Liège, yeah, that was in Liège, and th
en  Madame Bastin had a daughter, very, very 
nice, who was married t-to a lawyer and they
 had a little boy called Jacques, I remember 
he used to  come in the kitchen and I used 
to help him with my  homework -- with his -- 
my  home -- with his homework. And I guess it™s 
through them, that th
ey found a lawyer, 
it was a woman lawyer, and I went to her house 
and stayed with her for a very short time, 
because then they
 took the Jews from the citadel a
nd sh ipped them to Marlene, where 
they gathered the Jews from 
Belgium, to ship 
them out. And that™s when I went to 
Brussels.  
Q: Okay . How did you get word  th
at the Jews -- that -- that --  
A: That they went with -- from -- 
Q: -- finch -- that you -- that they were deported? 
A: How did I get -- 
Q: That your -- That your moth
er and sisters were deported? 
A: Well, we knew, somehow, that they were sending them to Marlene. As a matter of 

fact, they kept it from my fathe
r, because my father just want
ed to go out 
with his wife 
and the ch ildren. My  father just never was 
the same afterwards. And who it was, I don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

know, but somebody kn
ew that -- well, it™s li -- you kn
ow, like the -- the man who got on 
the train and somebody said, you know, ﬁY
ou™re -- You™re bei
ng deported, whoever 
wants to run, run.ﬂ I have no idea who -- y
ou -- words got around. It
™s like, when there 
was sabotage, it was --  word 
spread like wildfire that -- 
that the people were being 
stopped, there was a sabotage and people were
 arrested. I don™t know, we -- all I know, 
that we knew they were going
 out t-to Marlene and that™s 
when I went to Brussels, and 
stayed the last thr
ee months of the war. 
Q: Wh -- And how did you know where to 
go? How did you make
 arrangements of 
where to stay in Brussels? 
A: I stayed in Brussels with a couple by th
e name of -- his name was David Friedman. As 
a matter of fact, his family
, same family, owned a Bu ick 
agency here. I mean, I™m going 
back to the original 
owner in Cleveland. And, as a ma
tter of fact, he was a brother to 
Jacques Slomovitch. Why th ey had different 
names, I never unders
tood, but they  were 
brothers. And he was in bru -- in Brussels, 
and his home was never 
touched, because he 
had married a German woman who was not Jewi
sh, and he -- they had a son, yo -- yo -- 
yo -- Hakeem, I don™t know how to pronounce it 
in English. And I went there because I 
wanted to send packages to -- to
 -- to my family 
in -- in -- in Marlen
e. But they didn™t 
stay long enough fo r me to send any p
ackages. And I don™t know, it was Madame 
Friedman, I don™t know how she knew, she said
, ﬁNo,ﬂ she said, ﬁthe
y™re -- they™ve been 
de -- they™re -- they were deported.ﬂ And I never sent packages into 
ma -- into Marlene, 
because Marlene was close to Brussels, a
nd who would have take
n the package. You 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
21
 
 
 
know, the -- all this was kept qu
iet, so I re -- I have no names, I have -- I have no idea 
how she found out, I have no idea. I remembe
r, because she forced me
 to go to the show 
at the time. I don™t -- You know, we didn™t 
know ab out the concentration camp s the way 
they were, with the gas cham
bers. I remember crying like cr
azy and she forced me to go 
to the show with, I think y-yo -- Hakeem, 
with her son. That™s how I remember.  
Q: But you had -- you had no -- 
it sounded like you weren™t sure about wh at deportation 
meant at th e time. 
A: Right. We didn™t know -- We didn™t kn
ow the gas chambers, we didn™t know the 
torture. I didn™t know anyway. There were
 Germans who had es -- Jews, and who had 
escaped from Germany, into Belgium, but the 
-- the concentration camps as far as the gas 
chambers, not th -- in -- if my parents knew, 
they didn™t tell us. I 
didn™t know. I didn™t 
know.  

Q: And during the time that you were in Br
ussels, th -- I -- I -- you se -- mentioned in 
your testimony that your father was arrested at some point -- 

A: Poin t. 

Q: When  did that happen? 
A: It happened right after my mother and si
sters were arrested. I understand he went to 
the police and he said -- I don™t know th e details
, that he had stolen -- I guess what they -- 
what -- what the underground di
d -- is -- you know, farmers ha
d to turn in  their quotas 
whether it was wheat, eggs, butter. And what 
they -- what the unde
rground would do is 
go to the farmers and get load
s of stuff, that found it™s way on the Black Market, found 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
22
 
 
 
it™s way -- you know, you had -- 
I remember the two amer -- th-the plane that fell, and I 
know they never caught whoeve
r was in -- in the plane and 
we were told there was an 
American plane. Then  you had the undergro u
nd, it had to be [indecipherable] and th ings, 
and then the -- the farmers would call and sa
y they were robbed, and I don™t know if 
that™s what my father particip
ated in, but they arrested him 
and they put him in jail. And 
he would come up fo r trial and I -- he hired a 
lawyer and I went and 
I told the lawyer, I™ll 
never forg et it, ﬁGet my father liberated, or
 freed, whatev er,ﬂ and I said, ﬁI™ll k ill you.ﬂ 
Because I knew that he would have arrested 
him and deported him. So, he would come 
up for trial, they would postpone his trial. 
And then wh en war was over, I had to get a 
lawyer, because we were foreign citizen, we 
were not Belgian citizen, and because he had 
committed a crime, I guess, they 
were going to deport 
him. So it took a 
lawyer. I turned -- 
I think I went to -- to -- to Madame Bastin™s 
son-in -law, yeah, to have him -- whatever he 
did, he did. I -- He never took a fee or a
nything, and -- and my  father was let go and 
stayed in Belgium. 

Q: Let me make sure that I understand why 
you told the lawyer, ﬁYou free my father or 
I™ll kill you.ﬂ 
A: [indecipherable] 
Q: Is the -- because -- 

A: Be-Becau-Because, he was going around, and I 
guess he wanted to -- to -- to be with -
- with -- with my mother and with the children and I guess 
that™s what it was. I don™t 
know wh at else, he was trying every wh ich way 
to -- to -- to -- to fre
e them. As a matter 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
23
 
 
 
of fact, there was somebody -- I think it™s pretty
 true that he paid to  have my  mo ther and 
the children out of -- out of the citadel and th
en it never work ed out because I think it was 
true that there were -- we™re talking German soldiers, we™re not talking Nazi, we™re 
talking German soldiers, who would take mo
ney and be bribed and let -- you know, help 
people escape from there. I don™t know deta 
-- you know, this was all -- all hush hush and 
I left right after the war, so I never found out 
a lot of things. But you 
have to realize that 
he -- in the citadel, you had people who we
re accused of -- of sabotage and things, and 
they went into the citadel, not just Jews. So
, I know when I saw Rachelle years later in 
Israel, she told me that a -- 
a German soldier pa -- brought 
her milk and passed it through 
the bar to give to the baby. So, there was so
mething going on that 
the detail -- y ou know, 
nothing was talked about and I left shortly 
-- a year after the war, when  it was still war 
torn and people were co ming ba
ck, so I never got details. An
d I guess I never went into 
any details. I didn™t ask. 
Q: So it was your concern that if your fa
ther was freed, he would just get hims elf 
deported? 
A: Yeah, you got it, that™s right
. Whatever that meant, I don™
t know if I realized the f -- 
the full meaning of it, I don™t know. I -- 
I really don™t know. I have no id ea.  
Q: But you had the -- th e -- 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: -- impression that your father was not s-stable. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
24
 
 
 
A: Oh, that™s right. He didn™t care what happ
ened to him. He didn™t care -- for -- after 
that, he -- he didn™t care. As a matter of f
act, when  he died 10 years later -- he had 
remarried, and I did see his widow, and sh e to
ld me he never -- he never overcame the 
loss of my mother and the si -- 
and my  sisters, he never. He didn™t care, because he had a 
-- a blood clot, a thrombophleb
itis, thrombophlebosis, whatever
 it is, and he was told to, 
you know, flat in bed,
 you know, to -- until the -- all th
e clot dissolved, and he didn™t 
care, and that™s why -- my  unde
rstanding was that™s why he died
, the -- that the blood clot 
traveled and killed him. 

Q: When was that, that he died? 
A: 19 -- November 18, 19 -- whata -- ™55. 
Q: Okay, all right. 

A: Yes.  

Q: Not -- Not so long after the war ended. 
A: Well, 10 years.  
Q: 10 years. 

A: 10 years, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: 10 years. 

Q: So, it sound -- my  impression is that you 
were -- you had been, as a girl, fairly 
sheltered by your parents, and they  had prot
ected you, and -- and y
ou -- and you had not -
- you hadn™t been rich, but you 
had been well taken care of -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
25
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And now, all of a sudden
, towards the end of the war, 
after your mo ther and sister 
were deported, you were -- you were like th
e head of the family, and the kids -- 
A: I was left alone, I had to battle for mysel
f. I had money; we each 
had 200 dollars sewn 
into our coat, and my aunts address in Clev
eland. And I found my self completely -- I 
guess completely grown up. I mean, I was left
 alone, I mean I was -- I don™t know. I -- 
Well, actually, we matured -- we call it matu red,
 when  we went into  hiding, and when  I 
was a maid  in -- in the Bastin™s house. She wa
s not a very nice person. He was. He was -- 
I -- He married, years later, my school friend 
wrote to me. She -- She was not very nice to 
work for, she -- first o f all, I was a liv
e-in maid and there was a woman who was 
supposed to come -- I don™t 
remember, two times, or three 
times a week, and she quit and 
I was doing the work  of two people in a house that was kept immaculate, with -- don™t 

ask. So, I had to fight her off, too, I mean
, sh e was very demandi
ng. You know how i -- I 
-- I was -- I was a -- I was a kid, I was 16 year
s old. I look at my  grandchildren and I 
think to myself, oh my God, I were -- what do
 I -- how was I doing at that age. This is 
what™s happening to  me now. 
Q: How did you adju st to that roll that had su
ddenly  been  thrust on you of just being so 
responsib le? Did you -- Was it -- Were you ab le to do it? 
A: I -- I guess I had no choice and then I went 
back to live with my 
father, my aunt and 
uncle -- my father™s brother and his wife, w
ho had managed to go to -- to -- to France, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
26
 
 
 
came back with two children. And I fought, a
nd my  father and I fought and that™s why I 
came to the States. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah, you talked  about that some in 
your first interview, of that difficulty -- 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- with your father. 
A: He was not the same any more. I just -- It
 was his idea to come 
to the States to my 
aunt, you know, it was not -- i-it -- it™s so ha
rd to go into those details, you know. My 
cousin, who was deported with
 my mother, is -- the fath er
 came  back, made it through 
Switzerland, because his wife was pregnant a
nd Switzerland allowed, I think that™s what I 
was -- we were told, the pregnant women. A
nd he came back and he blamed my mo  -- 
my mother, my father for th
e boy going out with 
my mother. And I was so mad at my 
father because he let him live with us. And we
 were very cramped, we had three rooms, 
my  aunt and uncle came and I could tell you stor
ies, but it™s not -- it really isn™t worth it, 
it just -- it was not the same life, I mean we
 had a makeshift apartment, we were bombed, 
we were -- you couldn™t get places to live,
 and I don™t know, wh atever. And my cousin, 

who is now in Paris, was left alone and she ca
me to live with us for 
awhile and my  aunt -- 
my aunt -- don™t want to go into it, in case sh e 
listens to it. It was not pleasant, it was very 
-- it was very, very difficult. It™s -- It was 
not normal life, although 
my  father did get food 
and we never went hungry, but
 otherwise, it w as no life. It wasn™t the same any more. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
27
 
 
 
Q: And this was in bru -- did you stay in Brussels? 
A: No, no, in Liège. I went ba -- I c -- I ca
me -- I came back. I wa
nted to be with my 
father for my 18
th
 birthday and I got on a train in Bru
ssels, got as far Louvain, couldn™t 
go any further, because I didn™t realize they 
were still fighting, I guess, arou -- in the 
outsk irts of Liège, and we got on a ni -- I 
don™t know how many of us got -- got on a -- on 
a American jeep and we finished and went 
into  Liège, and I went to Monsieur and 
Madame Libare, and stayed there until I got to
 -- my father was freed and I went to live 
with him. 
Q: Where did he live at that time? 
A: Who, my father? 
Q: Your father. 

A: Yo -- Yo -- Well, we got a pla -- we got a qu
ota half a house, or whatever you want to 
call it, and we got together. I stayed with
 Monsieur and Madame Libare until then. 
Q: Was there any issue of property that you had lost? 

A: No, no, no, we -- we didn™
t own -- we don™t -- we didn™t 
own property. We wal -- We 
always rented. And I don™t kn
ow who took -- who t -- who em
ptied the belongings in th e 
house in the country. I have no idea. There™s 
so many -- I -- I -- I didn™t inquire, I didn™t -
- I didn™t dig into it. I guess -- I don™t know
, if I think back, who knows what I was 
thinking? I really don™t know. I really don™t know. Didn™t ask. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
28
 
 
 
Q: And at that time, w as -- were y ou all -- 
you and your father still
 holding out some -- 
some hope that even though wh at you knew 
that you thought maybe your family would 
come back? 
A: People -- People were coming out of the 
concentration camps. As a matter o f fact, 
Rachelle is the only one who surviv ed. And he
 would go to fortune te
llers, he kept hoping 
and hoping, and I rememb er 
some guy came out of the concentration camp, and I 
remember him s -- telling my father, ﬁDon™t 
hope, I took the bodie
s out myself from the 
gas chambers.ﬂ It was somebody who wa
s from Liège, who knew them. And then 
Rachelle came back, and I did see her. When 
I saw her in Israel, man y  years later, she 
couldn™t remember th at I saw her before I came 
to the States. And we didn™t talk in the -- 
they didn™t talk in those days. And I left, but
 w-wh at I understood afterwards is my  father 
blamed Rachelle for  my moth
er being exterminated, becaus
e when they went into the 
camps, they didn™t know -- they were sepa
rating the wo men and, you know, with 
children, and the story I got is 
somebody told Rache
lle to hand the baby 
to  my  mo th er. S o  
my father felt that she went 
into  the gas cham -- because,
 immediately they went in, 
because she handed the baby to
 my mother. The story I got 
when I went back is, they 
didn™t know wh at was happening and she ha
nded the baby to my
 mother not knowing 
that that was going to happen.
 My cousin was then 10 year
s old, and I was told -- and I 
can™t remember who said, that came out of th
e concentration camp, said that my sister 
Berta was given the option of going with th e 
women or to go with
 my mother, and she 
chose to go with my mothe
r. How true, who knows? But th
at™s what we were told. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
29
 
 
 
Q: And this was Auschwitz, yes? 
A: Auschwitz, yeah. 
Q: Do you -- So, when Rachelle
 came back, you -- she didn™t talk to you at 
all about what 
had happened? 
A: Nope. No. 

Q: Do you remember seei
ng her ag ain, and the -- 
A: Oh -- 

Q: -- just about that mom -- 
what that moment was like? 
A: She -- I -- I -- I can see her, but I can™t thi
nk of wh at we talked 
about. I know she was 
sterilized by Mengele. She couldn't have childre
n, or something. And I don™t even know 
if I understood the feel -- full meaning of it. Don™t forget, we were -- we didn™t have sex 

education and war, y-you do -- yo
u don™t appreciate the full me
aning of it. I -- Even when 
I saw her a year later -- years 
later, when I went to Israel 
-- I have a letter from h er, too, 
because I -- that™s how I found 
out the dates and the details and she says this was very 
hard for her to talk about. Th
at™s all I know. I never dug into it, I never faced th-the -- 
what really happened
, until many years later, until I went 
back to Belgium and my aunt 
told me, but I -- I didn™t want -- I guess now that
 -- in retrospect, I didn™t want to know. I 
was one of these people who didn™t want to know. 

Q: Were you having hopes for the future 
at that point? Were you th inking about that? 
A: Noth ing, nothing, absolu tely nothing. I ha
d no thought of future
, had no thought of 
anything, just a ca -- I guess day to  day. Yo u
™re asking me things, 
you know, and how did 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
30
 
 
 
I feel? In those days I just -- nope, absolute
ly nothing, and was -- my father, or some -- 
we contacted my aunt in Cleveland and 
I came to Cleveland, is what I did. 
Q: Mm-hm. You di -- Did you have an
y preference of wh ere you would go? 
A: I had no choice, because my  -- the only re
lative we had in the States, was my aunt in 
Cleveland. And I -- She signed the affidavit fo
r me, so I had no choice, I had to come to 
Cleveland, I had to come to her. 
Q: How long did you stay 
in Liège before leaving? 
A: Well, we were live -- the war was over in 
September ™44, and I left Belgium, I got on 
the boat in LeHavre in May one, 1945 --  ™
40 si -- wait a minute, I came in ™46 -- ™46, 
yeah, and that™s when I left. 
So I stayed in Liège from Sept
ember 1944, to just -- well, I 
left Liège, because I st
ayed overnight in Pari
s, to the beginning of 
May. I left -- I left 
May one from LeHavre and arrived 
in New York May eight, 1946.  
Q: So that year before you left Liège, yo
u -- you™re living with 
your father and -- and 
with -- can you tell me the names 
of the other people you were  
A: Well my -- my father™s brother Josef a
nd his wife Hosa, and their two children, 
William an d Mary, who were little tots. And I saw 
them again as teenagers, I went back a 
year after my father died. Th
en  I went back  once mo re and then  two years ago, I went 
with Elder Hostel to France and my  cous
in Miriam, who™s a ma
rried woman with two 
young adult children, came to Paris and we spen
d the day together. So, that what was left 
in Liège, and then I -- my fa -- one of my 
father™s brother, Gesa, w e made contact with 
him, through my cousin from Is
rael, and he came to the St
ates via his wife, because on

my father™s side, there was no 
one. And I remember before I left Belgium, we heard from 
him, and he had applied to come to the St
ates and I was going to  wait for him, and he 
says, ﬁNo, you go ah ead, and I™ll join you afte
rwards.ﬂ He came about two years later, 
and he went to New York, and I practically 
ran to New York. I got on the Empire State 
train and I went in on a -- I th
ink it was a decoration weekend, 
or Fourth of July, and boy, 
that Grand Central Station was mo bbed . He r
ecognized me for some 
ra -- reason or other, 
because  he used to travel a
nd he used to come to Liège 
-- I mean, my mo
ther, th -- the 
whole fami ly adored  my  mo ther, and he was 
in New York, and th en  he had TB of the 
spine and moved -- was transferred to Denver, 
to the National Jewish Hosp ital there. And 
he -- he was the only one, my  uncle in Lièg
e died. He had a heart murmur or something 
when he was a kid and he died of a heart 
condition. My uncle, my father™s -- I guess -- I 
don™t know if he was the youngest or -- or 
his sister was the youngest. She died of 
childbirth [indecipherable] abortion. Th-Th-The 
brother, Libou, was sent to Israel, he was 
11 years old, and we heard from him after th
e war, and he was killed with a shrapnel in 
his yard, he was on -- I don™t know, he was on 
the kibbutz, or they had sent money to him 
already. When they were figh ting -- they had the war to beco
me Israel, and I™m in touch 
with my cousin still yet, who was born you kn
ow, in -- in Israel, he
 lived in Denver, so 
that™s the four of us left, but otherw ise there 
is -- there™s no one left 
on my father™s side.  
Q: Was there any possibility of staying in 
Liège, or was that 
out of the question? 
A: I don™t know. The papers were made. As a 
matter of fact, if it would a happened later, 
this is -- was a f -- cousin of my father, he
 was the same age as 
my  Uncle Josef and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
32
 
 
 
came up through Italy with the Jewish Brig
ad e, and somehow or other was -- knew we 
were in Liège, and he found us
 in Liège, and as a matter of 
fact, he stayed with me in 
Brussels until I got on the train to go to Paris 
to come to the States
. Had it happened later, 
he probably would have arranged for me to go to -- to wh at was at the time, Palestine. Th 
-- Could have very easily ended up in Israel, as we
ll as in pa -- as -- as well in -- as in the 
States. I me an, it was just timing I guess, because when  -- by the time he came to 
Belgium, I -- the -- the paperwork had already 
started to come to the States, and I never 
reversed it. I wasn™t thinking, really. I got co
ld feet. When I got off 
the boat, I was one of 
the last one to get off the ship. 
Q: [inaudible] 
A: Yes, yes. Everybody was off but me.  

Q: Just going back fo r a minute. Did -- Did 
you have any Zionist 
feelings at all? 
A: Nope. I think as a kid, you know, you re
memb er vaguely, I mu st have belonged to 
something th at had to  do with th e Zionism, but
 I don™t remember -- it just something very 
vague. Vi -- I don™t even know the name of 
the organization, I re
member little si -- I™m 
go -- I rememb er going to meetings, but it™s so vague, I couldn™t even tell you. 

Q: Okay . 
A: I just couldn™t even tell you, because th
e only one who went to
 -- to, at the time 
Palestine, was my father™s brother. 

Q: Mm-hm. You mentioned that -- that your
 family was -- was relig ious and -- and --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
33
 
 
 
A: They came -- They came -- 
My -- Both my [indecipherable
] that was life in the -- in 
the country, were Orthodox, bu
t in Liège, they didn™t keep
 it. They a -- a small Jewish 
community. My father was not a believer. We went to services and was because of my  
mother. My father was not into 
it. I reme mb er he used to  talk and th ey gave him a hard 
time for Bar Mitzvah, because he couldn™t a
fford a new suit or so
mething like that. My 
father was not into it, and then my Uncle Ge
sa, who was a waiter, and travel and used to 
come to Belgium, I guess he didn™t keep ko
sher and fo r whatever reason or other, I don™t 
think we kept kosher any mo re. And th en we
 had the war. But I kn
ow my mother, even 
when -- because we had food on
 Black Market in Belgium, 
would not touc
h, like pork. 
She could not --  She did not touch it. I don™t th --

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: No, you can never predict who™s going
 to be interested , and who isn™t. 
A: But see, my  son was not -- didn™t dig into it
 either, and then he wa
s going to dig into  it 
with my -- my -- my late uncle
 in Denver, and my uncle died
 of a heart attack, so he 
never got -- he wanted  his experien ces. 
Q: Mm-hm. This is tape number two, side 
A, of an interview with Frida Wallenstein. 
Before we go on to talk about
 your journey, I wanted to  
ask you ab out Judaism after the 
war. We were just talk ing about how -- what 
your family™s religion was before the war. 
Did Judaism play a role right after the war ended? 
A: Not one bit. I -- The -- We had a synagog
ue, Orthodox of course, and the rabbi had 
gone to Russia on a visit and got caught duri
ng th e war, so we didn™t even have a rabbi. I 
went to the synagogue because I knew I had a 
male cousin and I had 
two female cousins, 
and I thought maybe I would run in to their hus
bands, which I never did. My  cousin Louie 
was in Manila. I don™t know where Al was,  the one -- I-I-I can™t remember. S o  I never 
found them, but there was, I guess soldiers, so
mebody gave money. I had never heard of 
Hanukkah , not that I rememb ered giving mone
y for the kids. I never saw anything, I -- 
the only reason I went to se -- to the synagog
ue was to see if maybe I could tu rn up one 
of my cousins. But there was no contact with
 the religion, at least on my -- on my part, 
and on my  father™s part, 
I don™t rememb er anything. 
Q: Okay, so you left from LeHavre 
on wh at boat? And -- And around when ? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
35
 
 
 
A: Oh, okay, I left le -- I went from Liège to 
Brussels, war torn -- first of all, I had trouble 
getting a passport, because Czech -- where I wa
s born became Russia, and we were told 
we could remain Czech or beco
me Russian, and we found out 
my father could not remain 
Czech because he had not served in the arme
d forces. So I had to go to Brussels, and I 
don™t rememb er who suggested I go to  the Office of the Foreign Ministry in Brussels, and 
I had to get papers to prove that I was no lo
nger a Czech citizen. And I didn™t get what a 
passport, they call it a laissez-passe, which me
ans let through, transl ated literally, good 
for one year, and so I could put my visa on. I 
had to go to Antwerp 
to get my visa, and it 
was through a school friend, not a Jewish gi
rl, whose father worked
 downto wn , next to 
the town major™s office. He didn™t speak Fr
ench, he didn™t -- a-
and my -- my friend™s 
father didn™t speak English and they wrote aletter to the embassy an
d I got a visa mu ch 
sooner than -- than if I would have waited on
 a regular basis, because after I came to the 
States, my father told me that I g o t calle
d to go get my  visa. And you couldn™t get  
passage because the GI™s were coming back, 
the war brides were coming. And I can still 
see the travel agent. I was at a friend™s house
 and he says, ﬁI got passage for you.ﬂ And I 
found my father, he had to bo
rrow money to -- to pay fo r my  passage. And I went from 
Liège to Brussels with my fath er, and this cousin from Israel
, and I remember he told my 
father, ﬁYou go back, I™m a so
ldier, I™ll be able to get transportation.ﬂ And I think it took 
me longer to go thro ugh the bord er of Belgium,
 France, than it took me
 to travel, because, 
you know, it was still after the war. France 
was still war -- we had everything, food, 
everything, France didn™t. Stayed overn ight 
in Paris. I met a woman on the train, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
36
 
 
 
somebody on th e train, a French woman -- 
there was Black Mark
et going on between 
Belgium and Germany, Belgiu
m and France, and she picked
 up th e Belgian accent, and 
wanted to  know if we had Belgian money -- 
and stayed  in Paris overnight. And there was 
a young girl who had married 
a GI, and th is woman was very sophisticated, and we went 
to LeHavre. War -- Was in ruins, I remember
 the debris and ev erything. And I came on a 
boat, that I used to call a ship
, called the SS  Uruguay. And 
we were 10 in a cabin, and we 
landed in  New York  on May eight, in 1946. 
Q: Why didn™t your father go with you? 

A: There was no reason for him to come to th
e States, I mean, he didn™t have anybody. It 
would have had to be 
my aunt, was my mother™s sister, 
would have signed 
the papers, he 
-- he -- I don™t know, I never asked. 

Q: But he thought it would 
be better for you to go? 
A: It was bet -- It was better, it ju st -- it just -- I wou -- I -- I was a y o ung woman, he -- he 
just -- he just didn™t know how 
to handle it. We were fighti
ng, we were arguing, we were 
-- I remember he didn™t allow me to wear lip
stick, I was 18 years ol
d. Lots and lots of 
reasons. I just -- It -- It™s very
 hard to go into it, and very
 personal, so I -- it just didn™t 
work out. I don™t even realize what I was doing by coming to the 
States, truthfully. I 
don™t know. 
Q: What were the thoughts in your head in
 the time that you were in -- on the ship? 
A: What were the thoughts? I think I was bla
nk. I -- I -- I don™t think I thought anything, 
all I -- the -- the only thing I 
remember, I saw  raw celery for 
the first time in my life, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
37
 
 
 
served on the ship, and I th
ought, ﬁWho eats raw celery?ﬂ 
And I think maybe I realized 
what I did, is when I went -- when we 
landed, when -- you know, when -- when we 
docked, I should say, and my  au nt, my  uncle 
and my  co usin Louie had a ca -- my cousin 
Louie had a car, drove to New York. There we
re two families who ha
d known my mother 
back in Czechoslovakia, who 
had migrated to New Yo rk ye
ars ago, and they  left my  
mother about the same age I came, and I guess they must 
have -- th -- th -- my aunt and 
uncle came -- came to the dock where -- wher
e we -- where we docked there, and my  
cousin had just borro wed a ha
t from one of the people on -- on -- on the thi -- because 
they couldn™t imagine what was 
happening to me, and I think 
I was afraid to get off the 
boat. I really was afraid to get off the boa
t. I -- I know they were cleaning -- I think 
maybe the whole boat was cl -- w as cleaned by 
the time I got off. And 
I think that™s when 
-- I think that™s when I got scared, but until then
, no. First of all, I w as a little seasick, not 
too much, I remember, and you were with te 
-- you know, nine other people in the cabin 
and I don™t   -- I think my  mind didn™t even  pr
oject into anything at all. I mean, I didn™t 
even think of language barrier. 
I didn™t think of anything. I -- 
Q: Did you speak any English? 
A: I did a little bit, because I had studied Engl
ish six years  prior to coming to the States, 
and maybe I have a knack for languages. I mean, it came out upside down an d 
everything, but I managed -- I -- I-I remember 
sitting down and writing 
letters in English, 
with the dictionary. I don™t know
 how, because two years is not
 a lot. But, what saved me 
with my  aunt is I spoke Yiddish . See, 
she spoke Hungarian, but I was able to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
38
 
 
 
communicate fluently in Yiddish, 
so that I was able -- I h ad no
 problem at home. I had no 
problem whatsoever. And 
then -- And then I found myself 
living -- I di -- I didn™t think of 
anything. I don™t rememb er even being conc
erned about language barrier, I didn™t even 
think of it.  
Q: And so you got off in New York , 
and then traveled to Cleveland? 
A: By car, yeah. We stayed in
 New York overnight. I rememb
er my -- they took me to a 
store and they bought me a coat and I thought
 it was the ugliest thing, but it wasn™t -- you 
know, don™t forget, the styles were entirely di
fferent. I came with a coat, it used to be a 
navy blan ket, and my  uncle was a tailor, you k
now, he had come back, and he made it for 
me. I mean, you couldn™t get fabrics, you couldn™t 
-- this is how y -- this is war torn, this 
is -- and I remember it was a fuchsia coat, I™ll 
never forget. I think I have a picture in it, 

with black lapels and a ba -- a belt. And I 
wanted bananas, because for money you could 
get just about everything in  Belgiu m, and the fi
rst boat, the banana boats came in just as I 
was leaving, and I remember my aunt eventua
lly hiding the bananas, cause she was afraid 
I would get sick. And I reme mb er distinctly, I 
had a soft boiled egg, and I had never seen 

this, where they crack the egg, 
and put it in a little dish. I was us
ed to eat it in the shell, in 
a -- in an egg holder, and I 
thought my  stomach was going to  turn, and I couldn™t say 
anything. Bu t wh at saved me is, you know, es
peci -- and with the 
p -- even the people 
who knew my parents, it -- to fa
milies, is -- is the Yiddish, 
I was able to communicate in 
Yiddish. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
39
 
 
 
Q: What was your au nt™s name? 
A: Lana Bern, she -- yeah, Lana
 Bern. She had three children,
 one daughter in California, 
one daughter who was married already, in Cl
eveland. She lived a -- wait a minute, Edna 
li -- no, Edna lived upstairs, yeah. She had a tw
o family with a third floor, and my cousin 
Louie wasn™t married and 
was still living with her. 
Q: Ah, just backtracking for a moment, wh
at -- do you remember what your first 
impressions were of New York ? 

A: Of New York  itself? No. The im -- what a -- what really impressed me is, y ou know, 

we drove back from new -- we drove from Ne
w York to Cleveland, so we™re through 
Pennsylv ania, and I just looked at the vastness 
of this country , I just -- I think I was awed, 
I was numb. That im -- New York, I don™t 
remember an ything from New York, I mean, 
as far as the city, I mean, we didn™t -- we
 didn™t sightsee, I mean, these people were 
anxious to see me  and to learn and -- and thin
gs like that. What awed me was the country, 
and my  co usin Louie was teasing me, some th
ing about the mountain
s and going thro ugh 
it, or anything like th at. I mean, the ten -- 
there was the Pennsylvania Turnpike, but not 
the Ohio Turnpike, and then it 
turn ed dark and he continued 
driving, but during daylight, 
I just looked at all that Pennsylv ania count
ry  and I just -- I wa -- just awed. Bu t New 
York? No, I didn™t remember 
New York, I didn™t -- I didn™t 
go -- I don™t even remember 
which store we went to go shopping for my  coat. 

Q: Did -- Did you talk to your
 near relatives at all about where you had co me from, what 
had hap -- just happened to you, 
what you were going through? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
40
 
 
 
A: What -- What happened when 
I came to my aunt, okay, is 
there is a -- a -- quite a 
community from Solo
tvona in Cleveland, and people ca
me to see me, I was -- there was 
one guy, I don™t know ho
w he got here before me, becaus
e he was a DP, he had been  in 
the concen tration camp, and he came to see me
 also. And people came to get information, 
news, and I kept saying -- I guess I mu st have
 been quote boatlag, I don™t know, is there 
such a thing? And I kept saying, I don™t kno
w anything, because I was in Belgium, so I 
could not bring them 
any news or anything from before
 the war from Solotvona, because 
I was two and a half years old when  my  f -- 
you know, wh en we left to Belgiu m. I had 
distant cousins who came, I m
ean people came because they 
wanted -- they wanted news 
from Solotvona, and I -- and I remember k -- 
kept -- in Yiddish kept -- that I remember 
distinctly, I kept saying, ﬁI don™t know an
ything, I wasn™t there,
ﬂ and you know, and -- 
and what saved me again was the Yiddish 
because these people, from that generation 
came and -- and spoke Yiddish, and I couldn™t
 give them any info rmation, but nobody 
asked me information about 
Belgium because they came 
-- they came from -- from -- 
from Czechoslo -- fr -- Austria, Hungary, Czec
hoslovakia, whatever it was when they 
came. 
Q: Did you feel that you had an
yone who was really interested
 in -- in you and wh at you 
had been through? 
A: No, no. As a matter of fact
, what I had is I found myself, for the first time, in a Jewish 
environment. Grew up in a Catholic environm
ent. And I remember di
stinctly that even 
with my  aunt, that I had to defend the Cathol
ics. I had to tell them th at Catholics saved 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
41
 
 
 
my life. Catholic risked their 
lives to save my life. Catholic s were to rmented, especially 
in Liège. I don™t know -- I don™t know abou
t the other part, I just me t somebody from 
Antwerp. The -- The walone, th-th-the -- the Fr
ench ones were very, 
very anti-Germans. I 
didn™t know from -- I didn™t 
know any anti-Semitism, unt-un
til Hitler started in ™42. And 
I don™t think they -- they -- they
 comprehended that. That is 
something I really -- th-that™s 
what came up, is Catholic helped me, Catholic
 risked their lives. Ca
tholic were persecu -- 
not to the extent the Jews were. You know, they didn™t -- they couldn™t take the whole 
country and send them to the concentration 
camp s. That™s what I had -- Wh at happened 
to me? I -- I ha -- trying to remember my -- 
my  au n t knew by  th en  th at my  mo th er was 
gone, but I don™t think they br
ought up too much at that 
time, of -- y ou know, America 
was getting over, I guess, depression, the wa
r, the bo -- the boys were coming back from 
the service. And it™s someth 
-- it™s not something th at was 
talked about that much. I 
remember, I don™t know if I was setting the table, clearing up the table or what. My 
mother -- My aunt, excuse me, my aunt said
 something about milladec, faishadec, you 
know, dairy made, and I said, ﬁWhat™s that?ﬂ 
And my  aunt said, ﬁWhat do you mean, you 
-- what™s milladec and faishadec, didn™t your 
mother keep it?ﬂ Oh, su
re, my mother kept 
it, four years of war, two years in hiding
, how are you going to  keep  the -- the -- the 
kosher laws, she didn™t even keep them befo
re -- before the war. That I remember, and 
it™s interesting, because I -- my aunt lit candl
es on the Sabbath, on Friday, and it came -- I 
had forgotten about that, it -- it™s interesti
ng what you rememb er distinctly, what you 
reme mb er vaguely. I had co mp
letely forgotten about candles and blessing the candles, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
42
 
 
 
and then I remembered  when I saw her doing it,
 and then  wh en girlfriend of mine did it, 
and it just -- I can see my  mo ther lighting th
is -- you know, and -- and blessing this -- the 
Sabbath candles, but I had completely forgotte
n about it. And I never kept anything, to 
this day I don™t. 
Q: Did you start going to services? 

A: Nope. I don™t -- I™m not practicing, I™m not a believer. I keep 
-- I -- Rosh Hashanah 
and Yom Kippur is something that is ve
ry vivid in my  mind. I don™t rememb er 
Hanukkah, I remember one seder. Rosh  Ha
shanah and Yom Kippur, I will not -- you 

know, I -- I -- what I do at home is my busine
ss. I didn™t go to work. I go for the holidays 
because I have very close friends who are tr
aditional and I go for breaking the fast and I 
go for this, but I am not -- I -- Passover, I d
on™t observe. I respect, but I don™t observe. 
What I do at home is my business. I™m not -- 
I™m not into it. I -- Wh
at happened to my 
mo ther shouldn™t have happened  
if religion was supposed to be
 what it™s wa -- that™s the 
way I feel. 

Q: Was it -- It sounds to me like an interesti
ng kind of role  reversal
. I think people would 
assume that having lived  in Europe during 
the Nazi era, that you would be especially 
aware of anti-Semitism, and that the people 
in America, would be
 oh, you know, we -- 
we don™t live in an anti-Semitic
 country, but it sounds like it 
was kind of opposite of that 
and that you came into a commun
ity that was -- that was very 
aware of their Judaism, and 
-- and very aware of -- of anti-Semitism. Was 
it difficult for you to ma
intain your identity 
of not -- not being oriented toward s J
udaism? Was that a conflict at all? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
43
 
 
 
A: No, it wasn™t. I mean, I remember -- you kn
ow, I made friends right away, all -- they 
were all American girls, they
 felt sorry for me. I still see th
em to this day, they had a 
sorority from high school. We just had a re
union because somebody 
came in from out of 
town . And I reme mb er going on the high holy 
days with a girlfriend, and we went from 
one synagogue to th e other, but as far as religi
on, religion for me to 
keep, that™s not what 
directed me, I did what everybody else did.
 I will -- do remember d istinctly, when came 
Yom Kippur, and my  aunt wanted  me to go to
 synagogue to say yi
sker for my mother, 
and I refused. I said, ﬁThat means I™ll bury my
 mother.ﬂ That I reme
mber distinctly. In 
retrospect, I think I did not accept for -- what 
really happened. First of all, I didn™t know 
the details. People didn™t talk 
in those days, right off, and re 
-- you have to realize I -- I -- 
I didn™t associate with the 
Europeans, with the DP™s w
ho came. Cousins came -- I had 
made American friends, and I went with th
em, and these were 18 
year old girls who -- 
who I don™t think talked  about
 -- who talked abou
t the Holocaust, outside maybe of the 
DP™s who came, I have no idea because I had 
no contact with them. I worked the sewing 
factory and they came there, but nobody talked
 about it, so religion-wise, no, I had to 
fight and say again with the Ca
tholics, I had -- I had to tell them that I did not face anti-
Semitism, and I think -- I think that was some
thing that was hard for them to accept until 
I left my aunt, and then inna -- it wa -- it wa
s n ever talked about. 
I worked in the sewing 
factory, there were all American girl -- girls,
 until the DP™s came, a
nd we had, I think, a 
Hungarian forewoman, and I don™t speak Hu
ngarian. I just found
 my self mo r e  in  
common with the American girls. Maybe I

whatever, whatever, and all th
e people that affiliated with even the factory, were not 
Jewish. Fa -- The friends that I made were 
Jewish, but the enviro
nment where I worked 
was not Jewish. And even wh en  I changed fact
ories, I think I was the only Jewish girl 
working there, when I went to
 Prinz beeterman. I never fe
lt out of place working among -
- among non-Jews. I would never -- never felt 
out of place, never felt different or 
anything.  
Q: Did you ever experience any 
anti-Semitism in this country? 
A: No, no, no, because 
I worked in the sewing industry,
 which was Jewish owned, but I 
had heard at -- over the years, as the girls we
nt out for jo bs, I heard about discrimination 

in hiring Jews, some of the 
comp anies. But I personally, no,
 no, never. I was very good 
friends with -- when I was at Prinz beeterma
n, pe-people of Catholic-Polish extract, I 
mean di -- didn™t talk religion, religion di
dn™t come into it. I -- I -- I -- I -- I never 
experienced it personally, no, nowhere. 

Q: What were y -- What were your -- your 
-- you™re starting to get settled in the 
Cleveland area, you™re starting to get familiar
 with -- with this 
new country. Wh at -- 
A: Very difficult. I said I was a dressmaker. 
I have wh at they call golden hands, meaning 
I™m very, very good with my hands. And Clev
eland was a center for the manufacturing of 
clothing. To -- My aunt took me to Lampoles
, and of course I was grabbed off, and I was 
in shock, because they had rows of sewing m
achines. I was not used 
to it. And I tried to 
tell them that I had gone to scho
ol, that I wa -- I was eight -- 
I was almo st -- just about 20. 
And I told th em I was a high school graduate
. I was -- I wasn™t graduated the high s -- it

was easier to say that I was educated. Look
ed like kid, didn™t speak English but very 
little. And for some reason or ot
her -- the only thing years late
r I could think of is, the 
environment I found my self, I could take 
my aunt -- even my parents, how much 
schooling did they have? And I 
think they put us all in the 
same package. Now, the DP™s 
who came, also didn™t have the education,
 because Germany inv
ited -- invaded, you 
know, much earlier, and th
ey looked at me, and I guess th
ey thought we were stupid, and 
they just put us in the same pot of the pe ople who ga -- don™t fo
rg et, during World War 
Two, there was no immigration, and they  pu
t me to put piecework. And -- And I was 
raised with clothes handmade, hand finished
. And I wanted to go 
back, but I couldn™t 
because my laissez-passe was good for one year 
and it was hard. It was very had to -- t-to 
adjust to the way of life. I had trouble with so
me of the foods a little bit. I didn™t have the 
best facilities living with my  aunt, because my
 cousin was still living at home, he wasn™t 
married and I slept on the couch. I lived w
ith my aunt for thre
e months. And then  I 
moved in with a couple, she was British, he wa
s a soldier in England, and he had married 

a British girl. I eventually no -- moved with them. In those days, girls didn™t rent 

apartments. And he was the brother of a very 
close friend of mine, to this day, I™m very, 
very close, it™s like family with me. And I liv
ed with them, but the 
facilities, don™t want 
to go into detail, couldn™t -- i-it ju st -- just 
for a short time. And I had been  introduced to  
a -- a girl two year -- Esther, Esther Berkow
itch, two years older than I was. And sh e 
knew of this couple who had a two family o
ff Kinsmen, 154 in Ki
nsmen, and they had 
two rooms that they rented. Like I say, they 
didn™t have apartments, we rented rooms, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
46
 
 
 
they were -- oh, I think they
 were about 80, even
 in those days, and they were ru -- 
Russian immigrants, spoke very 
little English and they hesitated 
in taking in a girl in the 
room, because, you know, werl washes her ha
ir, puts bobby pins, in 
those days. But I did 
move in with them, and I found a family, re
ally. I got very  close with one of their 
daughter-in-law, and I lived there. I was dati
ng very  heavy and it work
ed out very nicely, 
because I spoke Yiddish fluen
tly. And I went to work on 
the streetcar, and lived with 
them until I got married, really. Until I got ma
rried in 1948, in N
ovember 1948, and I 
lived with them. And I ad
justed. First of all, I did try to 
go back to visit my father, but 
after the real hard adjustment was over, coul
dn™t get a passport, cause I was not a Czech 
res -- citizen, I was not a Russian citizen, 
and I was not an American citizen. So I 
couldn™t -- I couldn™t get a pa
ssport, I couldn™t travel.  
Q: How did -- So you had this pass to stay 
for a year, what happened after the years was 
up? 
A: Oh no, no, it was good fo r one year, it couldn™
t be renewed, it couldn™t be renewed. I -
- I mean, th ere was no way -- there was no way 
I could renew it, and -- and it was a te -- a 
t -- a temporary, quote, passport. I mean, 
only cer -- because I was mi grating to  the 
States, so I couldn™t get a passport. 
Q: Okay. So -- So the idea was 
you were to stay in the Stat
es until a certain amo unt of 
time, when you would get -- be 
-- you said [indecipherable] 
A: [indecipherable] become an 
American citizen, which I couldn™t wait, and I -- because I 
married an American citizen, if you were in
 th e States one year, and married to an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
47
 
 
 
American citizen one year at that time, you co
uld become a citizen so
oner than  the five 
year wait. So I got -- I became an American c
itizen in four years, as opposed to five 
years, is w h at I did. But I was -- I came,
 what they call in 
French Sol nationalite 
determinet, which means I ha
d no nationality. And I -- That 
was it. So I couldn™t get a 
passport to go back and then I 
adjusted, and I made friends. I 
went to sorority meetings, 
didn™t understand a word, and co ncentrated on
 trying to understand. And I rememb er my  
girlfriends used to burst out laughing every so
 often because of my French -- very, very 
French pronunciation. I -- What
ever it came o u t -- I found out years, years later, I met a 
young woman here in the comp lex  who was 
from France, and she came for a short time, 
and for the -- bud -- my -- a few years ago, I 
was already speaking English fluently, even 
lost my French accent, and I heard her, with
 her pronunciation, and I says, ﬁNo wonder 
my  girlfriends used to burst out laughing.ﬂ
 I learned -- I remember when I learned -- I 
used the wo rd douche the first time. In 
French , a shower was a douche, so I took a 
douche, and they were laughing, and I --

e [indecipherable] because I went to school, 
and became a secretary. 
Q: Oh, okay. Wh en did you do that? 

A: I married in ™48. When my son was born 
in ™51, we moved to  Sandusky, Oh io, wh ich 
is not far from here, Aceder Point, and we
 lived there for seven years. My husband

became ill. I was working in 
the factory until shortly befo
re my son was born. I had 
female trouble, he was born early, I had a 
difficult pregnancy. We
 moved to Sandusky, 
and we struggled . Financially, emotionally, bu
t we made very good friends. I made some 
very, very good friends
 in Sandusky. It™s mu ch developed since then. And th ere was no 
pla -- we didn™t have money, so
 we made friends, we babysat
 for each other. Spend -- We 
had friends, we went for Christmas dinne
r, Easter dinner. There was a sma ll Jew ish 
community, we were not active with it. We we
re turned down to go 
to services because 
we didn™t have money. That was also a slap 
in the face. And my hus became quite ill, was 
hospitalized, and I moved back to
 Cleveland. Tried to get ba
ck into the se
wing industry, 
went to Prinz beeterman, but the place had 
ch anged, ended up doing 
alterations in small 
stores. My son was young, went to Jewish Fa
mily Service, got no help. I very hurt 
feelings and very -- not bitter any more, but -- 
and I went to work in small stores with 
alterations, which paid very, ve
ry little. My husband came out 
of the hospital, went into 
practice. I went to work for him, then he
 was hospitalized again fo r a very, very  long 
time. And I worked with a Social
 Worker, to cope with his illn
ess, to cope with my child. 
I was very, very concerned abou
t my child, and I wo
rked with a Social
 Worker, and then 
eventually  with the child psychi -- my  son wa
s alright, but it was to help me cope, and to  
try to keep him as even as can be. And it was 
through the help of a 
Social Worker, at the 
VA, that I had the guts to go to school, and ta
ke classes to become a secretary. I saw the 
writing on th e wall, I didn't know how long my 
husband would be ill, and I couldn™t stay 
in the sewing industry, I worked
 for a small store, there were long layoffs, there were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
49
 
 
 
short hours. And they  didn™t have the So cial Se
curity laws where you get Social Security 
for -- for an ill person, it came later. And I went -- 
I went to Dyke first, and then I went to 
Tri-C, because Dyke was expensive, and I fi
nished off there. And I was working half a 
day, going to school, borrowed a 
tape machine, and I™m talking an  old tape, to -- to do my 
shorthand, which I never used even tually, 
anyway. Was very nervous, was very self-
conscious, and it was through th e help of 
a So cial Worker that gave me enough 
confidence to say -- you know, I was a forei
gn background, my accent
 was much heavier. 
I spoke English fluently, but I ha
d never had real formal English.
 I went to Tri-C, took an 
English class. Got me more confused th
an anything. And I e
nded up applying at 
University Hosp itals, couldn™
t pass the typing test, I was 
so nervous. I did pass the 
spelling test, but in those days I used to go -- 
in French they spell it 
this way, in English 
it™s this way, I was still, because I hadn™t 
worked with the Englis
h language. And I -- You 
have to be at the right place at the right 
time, and they  had someone who took care of 
secretaries. I was coming out of school, I me
an, I -- I had -- I had the certificates for 
passing the typing and everything, and I gue
ss I made -- not I guess, I made an 
impression on th e head of personnel at the ti
me. I was a foreign bac
kground, I was in the 
sewing in dustry, and in those days, adults didn™
t go back to school, ve
ry, very few, and I 
went to Tri-C, I think I met one or two adu
lts who went to school. And th e doctor who 
hired me, he -- they told me
 later they felt sorry for me
, because I guess I was v ery 
scared, I was very self-conscious. I was sel
f-conscious of my  English, and I thought I 
would go to work. Ev
en though I didn™t pass the typing 
test, they se nt me to three

interviews. I never made the third one, and I took this one. And I went -- I worked for 
him for 10 years, because he 
left University Hosp itals, a
nd I was going to work three 
years and better myself financially, but the wo
rk was so interesting, because there was 
research, because of the aff
iliatio n with Case West -- well,
 it was W estern Reserve then, 
Case Western Reserve. And he left, and I stay
ed on for three years,
 and I julo -- just 
loved my  wo rk, the best thing I did was l
eaving the sewing industry. I was way down  
financially when  my  husband 
got sick. I -- His brother saved me with a few dollars. I 
didn™t have money to feed my  kid at the tim
e. I -- The sewing industry, I struggled -- I 
did get some money, was it Social Security 
at the time, a little bit, an d I managed to 
survive. And once I went into 
become a secretary, my  su -- I was divorced, my  husband 
wanted to  -- the divorce, and my  son went to
 live with him, and I got on my  feet. And th e 
best thing I did was to leave the sewing indus
try. My mo th er used to say, ﬁIt™s much 
easier to workwith
 your brain, than to wo
rk with your back,ﬂ whic
h I couldn™t see at the 
time. And I worked in an envi
ronment that was intellectual, 
even though I was not much 
of an intellect, but I learned a lot. We had 
a lo t of people coming and going and I just 

loved my work, because those 
were the days of the typewr
iters, we typed 
and we typed 
and we typed. And it so happened that everyb
ody was foreign. The director was foreign, 
the associate director was -- he was f -- grew
 up in Austria, the associate director was 
from Yugoslavia. We had a technician from 
India, with -- one time there was -- the 
supervising technician was the only one who 
was an American person. And I ended up, 
for some reason or other, my  English was ve
ry, very good, and I 
started slowly editing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
51
 
 
 
the manuscript. We™re talking technical manus
cript research. And first with the commas, 
and with the this, and slowly 
but surely, over the years, I 
edited from one paragraph to th e 
other, from one part to the other, and I didn™t
 allow him to put my name on as whatever 
he produced , and produ -- the only place Iallowed him to acknowledge me, he wrote a 
book on babies born with birth defects in 
the brain, because I was secretary to the 
Division of Neuropathology. And that™s th
e only place my -- that I allowed him to 
recognize m -- I used to tease him, I says, ﬁI 
don™t want to be affiliated with this.ﬂ And 
the work was very, very in teresting. He left -- 

Q: What was his name ? 
A: Reinhart Friede. It was very interesting, 
because my name is Frida, but his was F-r-i-e-
d-e, and only twice was there a mi-mix up, be
cause I didn™t hear the doctor in  front of 
Friede, otherwise -- an d I spell mine F-r-i-d-a
. But, we -- only twice it happened that the 
names were confused . And he was a very straight  faced, he looked  ve
ry stern, but oh, did 
we have fun. I mean, we had technicians who we
re a lot of fun. I never lost a day™s pay. I 
learned to get on my  feet, I learned to invest
 money, in a small way. And I ret -- And 
then, they had a new director who came, w
ho was a complete opposite, Dr. Gambetti. P. 
Luigi Gambetti, with su
ch different personality, I thought
 I would never make it, and for 
three years, it just didn™t work, and his wife
 wa -- he™s an MD, his wife is a Ph.D., and 
she came, she™s from South America, and it took 
th ree years to adjust, and to this day, I 
go and I visit with them, I inv
ite them for dinner. Their da
ughters came in from out of 
town, I went. And I was able to say, ﬁDr. 
Gambetti, I don™t understand Italian.ﬂ And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
52
 
 
 
was able to close the door and say, ﬁYou 
have to hear me,ﬂ because his mind was 
someplace else, and I was handling a lot, a lo
t of money on grants. And I retired from 
there just in time, before -- as
 the health industry is changi
ng, there™s no mo re Division of 
Neuropath ology, as far as the 
hospital is concerned.
 I had hospital work, and bulk of my  
work was Case Weste rn Reserve University, be
cause of the research, 
and they eventually 
hired another secretary, she took my place as
 a matter of fact. And I ended up handling 
grants, and I kept screaming, ﬁI trained to 
be a secretary, not a bookkeeper.ﬂ Finally got 
the stuff on the computer, and it was dou
ble work , because the computer did not 
communicate with the accounting department of
 Case Western Reserve University. So I 
was projecting on the computer, and multiplyi
ng, but then I still had statements every 
month. And I just didn™t like my work any 
more, because I didn™t do the manuscripts. 
You know, the word  processors
 came out. I didn™t read them over and over. Today they 
are all type, they are all manuscripts mo re 
or less, change them, you know, on the wo rd 
processors. So it just wasn™t
 the same and the set up with
 the administrators who are 
changing, and I got out just in time. I don™t th
ink I could have surv ived it. But I learned a 
lot, my  mind was wo rking and he gave me 
a party when I retired
, Dr. Gambetti. No 
secretary had what I had. He -- Dr. Russman
, the ass-associate di
rector, had a daughter 
who was doing, on the side or second job,  or whate -- she did cat
ering on her own, and 
we went to the conferen ce room in one of 
the -- in the Bowwell Center. And he gave me 
a going away party with beef tenderloin, wh
ite wine, flowers, you name it. And I know 
what disp leased me is I had to invite ever
ybody in the -- in the Institute of Pathology, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
53
 
 
 
even the people I didn™t care. I had to think 
of people from Case Western Reserve that I 
had a lot of contact, from the hospital. I thi
nk I had ab out 100 - 110 
people. And we had a 
storm that day. My  girlfriend from Beria neve
r made it, they were iced in. And they 
presented me with a gift certif
icate that just about covered a 
cruise, because I told -- I was 
so tired, I was trying to  wind up ev erything, 
not to leave loose ends, be -- by the time I 
left, and it didn™t work out. Everything chan
ged afterwards, anyway. And that™s the going 
away he gave me. I went shor
tly after, with a tray of candy 
and was able to write a note, 
ﬁI know it™s because of you that I had this.ﬂ
 Today they c
ouldn™t do it, becau
se the money 
isn™t there, but that™s -- that™s what I got 
as a going away for retiring. It was such a 
different environment than the sewing industry, 
especially in the small shops. I work ed in  
-- in the sewing industry I worked with, at th
e time, man y  Polish immigr -- DP™s actually, 
who had gone through anti-Sem
itism, the camps. A
nd when  you sew, your mind is not 
occupied, so they would tr -- 
you know, they would talk abou
t different things. And they 
-- I was raised whatever I do is good enough, a
nd I was not afraid of anything. I mean, tar 
-- I was a shy girl and everything, I mean, ta
lk about what was left, after that I just 
blossomed out until I wasn™t afra
id of anything, and I wasn™t 
afraid to speak back. And it 
-- the store I worked in, it wa
s the couple wh o owned it. He was low key, she was -- I 
don™t know why these people were afraid of
 her, she used to come down  and I don™t 
know. The bookkeeper was 
an American born American
, and she thought she was 
something better th
an anybody else. 
Q: You™re talking about the alteration store? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
54
 
 
 
A: The alterations, and the store, she -- I me
an, I faced her -- I -- I was not -- I was not 
concern, I mean I just put her straight. And 
I used -- I remember one time, I say, ﬁWhat 
are you afraid of?ﬂ I says, ﬁWe all leave, they 
can™t keep  the store going, th ey need us.ﬂ 
You know, there was six or seven of us wo rki
ng there. So, when I left there, my  biggest 
pleasure was, as I was going to  
school and wo rking th ere, and I decided I had to give up 
the work ing, ya -- because I couldn™t practice 
my  typing. I did well in
 shorthand, but not 
in typing, and I just couldn™t keep up. My
 husband was hospitalized out of town, and I 
was driving back and fo rth on th
e weekend. And my  biggest pl
easure was when I went in  
and I was hired, through University Hospitals
, I bought a used car, and I went in, because 
I had befriended -- her name is
 -- was Litta Ridman, she wa
s 80 years old at the time. 
And I came in with the keys, and I said -- not
 knowing what I was walking into, I said, 
ﬁI™m secretary to the professor of neuropath
ology at Western Reserve Un iversity,ﬂ and 
was it Fran, the bookkeeper or was it th
e owner Mr. Philips, who say, ﬁWhat™s 
neuropath ology?ﬂ An d as a foreigner, it made me
 feel so gra, because I don™t know why, 
in the small stores, they just 
-- they try to -- to make you 
look down. And the head fitter 
was a German woman, Jewish wo man, who kne
w less than I did in alterations, I guess, 
for some reason or other, she had learned, an
d really was -- at times she was alright. She 
had a husband who had MS or so
mething. She had problems, but
 I just put my foot down, 
because I said, ﬁShe has problems, so do I.ﬂ
 And I remember a co
uple times, I took a 
gown  and I threw it at her, because I knew mo re
 than she did as far -- nobody could take 
away the sewing from me. Took me a hard ti
me struggling to become
 a secretary because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
55
 
 
 
I was confident in sewing, but not as a secret
ary. B-Yet after worki
ng th ere, it work ed out 
all right. I mean, I was confident, I was comfor
table, I was respected and I worked in an 
environment that, you know, th e hospi -- it 
wasn™t even the hosp
ital, it really is 
pathology, neuropath ol
 -- you know, you get cornered in
 one small division -- where I 
was respected, and th ere -- there -- there ca 
-- there th -- you had MD™s
, Ph.D.™s, and very 
play -- you know, nobody put on
 the air, you were accepted, on -- on -- on -- on a same 
level. So I -- I worked myself out, and I starte
d, quote, living. It™s not a full life. My son 
went off to Kent, married. I have three beau
tiful granddaughters. On
e just graduated from 
high school. She is off to college in va --  
in Virginia, she™s off to
 college. Alicia just 
turned 18, Whitney wi
ll be 16 in September, and Erica,
 the little one, just was Bats 
Mitzvahed in May. And I hoped to go back  
and forth to Virginia, 
really. Besides, I™ve 
been traveling on a trip, a big trip once a 
year. And it™s hard to see my  grandchildren 
grow up, because I look at them and think to
 myself, ﬁOh my God, 
that™s the age I was 
that Germans walked in on 
that time.ﬂ And things are surfacing, I guess, that maybe I 
pushed back, that I didn™t want to face. I ha
ve guilt feelings, when things are very, very 
bad for me. Not lately, so much
. When I™ve gone through diffi
cult times, I have felt that I 
was being punished , that I deserved it, becaus
e I didn™t suffer the same as my family did. 
And it -- it just happens every so often, and I 
think wh at I™m going to 
do now is try to call 
it quote, finalize. I™m going to look into a tr
ip to go [indecipherable]
 feeling -- and I know 
there™s nothing there, to go to
 yadva -- to -- not to Yad Vash
em, to Auschwitz, just to get 
it out of my system. And fo r many years, I tho
ught, oh maybe my sister is f loating around 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

someplace, and doesn ™t know wher
e she is. And I think, as I get older, I realize how alone 
I am. I have no sisters, I have no nieces
. My husband comes from 
a ra -- broken family, 
and I have no nieces and 
nephews. The fe -- cousins that 
I have -- I have one that I™m 
pretty close with. But he™s quite
 ill now, is -- as it is, their 
children live in the same area 
where my son lives, all three of them. But I ha
ve, as far as family, family, but I ha -- I 
have no close ties. But I have -- still have fri
ends from -- I met when I came to the States. 
My girlfriend Esther, with wh
om I™m very, very close, died many, many years ago, of 
breast cancer. Many years ago. And I have tw
o of the -- the girls that I met fro m the 
sorority that I consider fam ily. I g o  there -- I -- I™m not i
nvited, I™m expected. Bu t wh at 
happens, we™re all getting older, so now th
e children are doing th
e holidays and it so 
happen they™re out of to
wn. So, my life is changing a little 
bit, you know, as far as that™s 
concerned. But they ™re 
-- they™re two friends -- I have ot
her ones too, that I can depend 
on, and I consider fami ly, but
 you realize, I don™t know wh
y, it scares me some times, 
because I don™t want to get depressed, I don™t 
want to run into -- to the elderly lev -- you 
know, left alone or something like that. 
And -- And to  feel, you know, I do -- I do get 
down, but everybody does at one time or ot
her. I seem to  overcome it, and I™m very 
thankful for what I have, really. I™m comforta
ble financially. I take 
one big trip, at least 
once a year. Went to the -- a national parts la 
-- parks last year with a friend. The year 
before, I was in France. I have plans to go 
to Iceland in September. I™ve gone with Elder 
Hostel, and I go for short trips to
 an Elder Hostel with a frie
nd, or I™ve gone by my self. I 
went to Equador by myself, had a strange room
 mate, the same thing 
to France, and that™s

about it, really. But the guilt 
-- the guilt -- the guilt is there,
 the guilt is. Although I don™t 
face real hard times, like wh
en my husband was ill, and 
things came up, and it™s a 
terrible, terrible feeling. I used to also shu
dder when I used to hear
 the airplanes, when 
they had the propellers, but now they have th
e jets. But I -- When the airplanes used to 
go, I just -- just absolutely 
shuddered, but now with the pr
ope -- with the jets, you don™t 
get it, so I -- I don™t feel it any more. I don™ t quite have the nightmares I used to -- to 
have. I guess I™m settling, I gu
ess. Trying to en joy my  gra
ndchildren. Not one of them 
belongs to me, they all take after the father™s
 side of the family, their grandfather, and the 
middle one takes after her mo ther™s side of th
e fami ly, because one is strawberry blonde, 
two redheads. And the eyes and 
th e shapes, there isn™t one that belongs to my  side of the 
family, nothing™s come out. But, make the be
st of it. So, I™m not unhappy, it™s maybe not 
a full life, but I™m contented, make the best of it, you know. 

Q: I have few questions. One is, if you™re 
-- just talkingabout 
your idea of going to 
Auschwitz to get -- to get it out of your system -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and I -- and I -- it reminded me of what you said about after you arrived in the U.S., 
and -- and your aunt had 
wanted  you go and say yisk
er for your mother -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- and you weren™t ready, becaus
e you didn™t want to bury her. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Is this kind of like saying I™m ready to
 -- to bury her, or di
d that ever happen?

A: I -- I™m -- You know, first of 
all, when I went back to Be
lgium, 10 years after I came -
- a year after my father died, my aunt brough t up some of the ho-h
orrors, which I didn™t 
want to listen to. And then people started ta
lking about the Holocaus
t. I never -- When I 
talked about it, I talked abou
t my  years in hiding, things 
like that. I did not talk about 
what happened in the concentration camps. Wh
en it really, really su
rfaced is when I was 
interviewed for the mu seum, and I had to bring 
all that up. I had to  dig in on -- oh, and I 
saw -- I saw Rachelle in Israel, sp ent a -- a ni
ght -- a day with her. I dug into   a lot of 
things, and then I worked w
ith a young man, I can™t think -- I have his name written 
down , and he sent me -- I havethe papers that show the numbe
r of th -- their records that 
were kept in  Liège, of the numbers of 
the transport. And I 
guess -- No, I think I™ve 
accepted it, I just -- I just -- th
ere™s some -- I don™t know if I™l
l go, but I™m going to look 
into it, just to -- I don™t know
 what good it™ll do just to -- 
I don™t know why, I mean it™s 
not going to do any good. Ther
e™s very little left, I™m aware of it. And maybe go and see 
eastern Europe, I don™t know. I don™t know why 
I have to do it. But 
I™ve accepted a long 
time ago, if you can accept some -- somethi
ng like that, there™s sti
ll -- I don™t know, some 
feelings or something. And now, with the 
grandchildren sometimes asking questions, it -- 
it has -- it has to -- it has to be accepte
d. I me an, there™s no tw o ways about it. 
Q: What do your gran dchildren ask you? 
A: That™s interesting. No
t much, not much, not much. 
Q: You were mentioning earlier that -- that 
one of them is particularly interested. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

A: The little one has asked me -- excuse me -- 
more questions. Sh -- I had her in the car 
with me, by myself, and sh e sa
id, ﬁYour mother died,ﬂ or 
something like that, and she 
started asking me -- when she ju st did a -- a pr
oject on immigration, and I gave her all the 
papers, and she did ask me why I left my fath
er, which was very hard for me to explain. 
You know, there™s -- th ere were such hard fe
elings, there™s no -- no need to bring it up 
any more, it™s in -- in the past, and I just told 
her my father thought it was better for me to  
be with my aunt. Sh e™s asked me mo re questions. Alicia, I guess through projects in 

school, I remember I h ad to tell her somethi
ng, and I can™t remember what. Whitney, the 
middle one, has never asked me 
any questions, but that does
n™t mean anything. My son 
never asked questions either. I did hide the pi
ctures, because everybody had died, and yet, 
when he le -- heard about -- that™s how I fo
und out about the mu seum, and he told me 
about it, he apparently  was very well aware of
 it, and what™s interesting is he named -- 
Whitney , the middle one -- I don™t know how yo
u -- they ended up with Whitney after 
my  mo ther, he said that it should always be rememb ered. And even  when  the girls have 

the Bats Mitzvah, he does bring up that my
 family perished in 
the Holocaust. It™s 
interesting, because I was never very trad itional. He was not Bar Mitzahed, but he 
became very close with the temple, and the -- 
the girls are very -- course, well, he became 
involved  somehow or other, ev
en though I never 
pushed it. And I di
d all this for my 
children, so lot of things su
rfaced when I did the interviews
, and things. As a matter of 
fact, my son, when he was in Kent -- I didn™t 
mention it, when  he went to Kent, they had 
the Yom Kippur war, and he raised money fo
r i -- for i -- for Israel. He and his room 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

mate, they lived in th
e Hillel House, the Hi-Hillel had re
nted a house and he -- and he™s 
still friends with this guy, o
ccupied the third floor, the upsta
irs. And they raised money 
for Israel. They made the national news as a 
matter of fact, because they raised money fo r 
-- he had -- it was a ham operator and when he 
told me was president of Hillel, I almost 
flipped because, I mean, you know, so I gue
ss even though I wa
s not traditional in 
keeping the holidays, so
 to speak, and things like that
, there™s some Jewishness in him 
and the girls are -- went through Bats Mitzva
h and everything like that, so some thing is 
projected on him. And it™s hard to tell with 
Alicia how mu ch she feels or how mu ch she 
does or -- you never know, and fi
rst of all, they live long dist
ance. Maybe if they lived in 
town , it would be different, I don™t know. Wh
itney™s the only one who never asked, but 
she™s the quiet one. I don™t know.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is tape number three, side A,
 of an interview wi
th Frida Wallenstein. 
A: -- and so, you know. 
Q: You™re doing very well, but I know it™s hard
. I appreciate you doing it. I wanted to ask 
you about -- about speaking, too, because 
you were mentioning about your -- the 

testimony th at you did for the Holo caust 
Museum. I believe that was in 1990. 
A: I think so . [inaudible] 
Q: And -- And you mentioned that it was -- that
 it was difficult to talk
 about it. Was that 
the first time that you had sat down and -- and 
tried to tell your story, through, of wh at 
had happened? 

A: Yes, that was the first time. That was the 
very first time, and I really had to dig, and 
you know, sh -- I remember he
r saying, ﬁHow did you feel?ﬂ I had to stop and th ink, I 
mean, how did I feel? I don™t know, it™s not thin
gs that I think ab out. So you have to dig 
up all these memories and all these feelings
. How did you feel? I -- I don™t know how I 
felt, I had to stop and th ink. Was I scared? Sure
, we were scared at times. What did I feel 
when my mother -- when I 
found out about my mother 
being deported? I rememb er 
crying in Brussels, I 
remember, an d Madame Freidman fo
rced me to go to -- I hated her, 
but she forced me to go to
 the shul, she thought it would be better for me. You float 
around, you have no thoughts. Why I came to
 the States? Who knows? I have no idea -- I 
really don™t know, you -- you 
do things, you -- you don™t th
ink. I -- I didn™t have an 
average teenage life. I mean, I look at my  gr
andchildren and I don™t know wh at I would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
62
 
 
 
have done. Of course, no matter what war, no
t war, every generation i-is different The 
kids are so much more aware than we were
. There™s television, there™s e-mail, there™s 
internet. I mean, they™re -- we didn™t know. We  didn™t -- We didn™t question, we didn™t 
ask. I mean , children were to be seen and 
not heard, so I don™t know, don™t rememb er 
anything. So , I have to dig in, to really st
op and th ink, and rememb er things. I know -- I 
don™t even know if we were really cousin, my  c -- we refer to her as cousin, her name is 
also Frida. She lived in
 Belgium. I came to the States, a
nd I found out years later that she 
went to Israel. She married -- She married a F r
ench Algerian and she 
lives in Paris, and 
I™ve seen her twice, and then
 we dig into th ings and so
me th in g s sh e reme mb ers  an d  
some things I rememb er. But the first time 
this came about -- I don™t think it did the 
second time, she -- she had to wake me up du
ring the night because I had nightmares. 
When  I was in Paris two years ago, and my  
cousin Miriam came in  from Brussels, we 
spend the day togeth er, she had questions abou
t her father and thing. And I had to stop 
and think, because we grew up as -- we
 didn™t question, yo
u know. Turn it off. 
Q: Is th -- Have you -- Did you find, when
 you did your testim
ony for the Ho locaust 
Museum in 1990, was it important to you in
 so me way, to have talked about it?  
A: I did it originally to -- to 
-- what made me  do it, because my
 son wanted me to do it. I 
think until then, I did not appreciate the impor
tance of having tes
timonies, you know, so 
that, well, the non-believers will never belie
ve it happened, but that there should be 
something that -- from su
rvivors, t-to prove that these 
things really existed. I never 
thought of it in those terms before, never th
ought of it until Mark called me. As a matter 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
63
 
 
 
of fa -- I didn™t think th ey would take my  -- 
my  -- my  story, becaus
e when he first told 
them, I say s, ﬁMark, they won™t be interest
ed, because I was not in the concentration 
camps.ﬂ But apparently it was more than ju
st for -- from people in the concentration 
camps, so -- but I didn™t -- I didn™t see th
e importance of it until -- until then. And -- And 
now, with the girls getting older, the gran
dchildren getting older 
and asking questions, 
and things like that, I feel it™s imp o rtant 
that there™s testimony, what it -- what will 
happen years later, I don™t kn
ow. Look what™s happening in
 Yugosla -- it still goes on, it 
doesn ™t stop it, but at least there™s proof, w
hoever wants to believe it, to know that it 
really happened. And we™re slow
ly dying off, so there isn™t 
-- you know, a lot of people 
have died since, and cannot testify. 
Q: And for yourself, personally, was it 
important in any way, or is it not? 
A: I never -- I never thought of it as being im
portant for me. I only thought of it as being 
important for my -- for my son, and for my gr
andchildren, is -- I fe
lt it was important. I, 
for myself, I mean, no, I didn™t -- I didn™t th
ink of it that way, anyway, no. And I™m doing 
this also because of that, b
ecause it™s very difficult, you have
 to dig up memories that are 
very difficult, you have to di
g up feelings, you have to ex
pose your feelings. I don™t 
know.  

Q: [indecipherable] You were 
talking a little earlier about 
your -- your work, in the 
doctor™s office, and I just wanted to know wh
en -- when you started that work, and -- and 
when you retired? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
64
 
 
 
A: I retired December, 1991, the 
end of the year. I worked for 
27 years. When did I start? 
1975 - 1976, is when
 I started, yeah.  
Q: And then -- And then, before that, yo
u were talking about how you had -- you™d 
worked in the -- in -- 
in alterations, and that
 you had had trouble w
ith -- when you were 
looking for work, is it -- as a 
seamstress, was it the Jewish So
cial Services, or -- did you 
find that -- that, during that 
time when you were struggling 
to find work, were y -- did 
you feel that you were being discriminated agai
nst in some way, or not respected, or wh at 
was -- 
A: No, no, y-you mean, the 
w -- to find work? I had no
 trouble finding work  in 
alterations. That was wide open. There was no 
money in it, that™s w h at made me leave. 
Bec -- I didn™t go for the department stores fo
r some reason or other.
 I went to the small 
shops, and sewing in dustry is predominan tly 
Jewish, and I work ed w
ith, you know, a -- in 
-- in those days, DP™s. I mean, to day it™s entirel
y different. I left because first of all my 
mind -- your -- y-your mind is not occupied, 
so you talk, and you 
bring up th ings. I was 
having problems because my husband was ill at
 the time, and -- and 
y-you have too much 

time -- y-your mind is free. In other words, 
your hands are busy, but not your mind. And I 
needed a better income
 than doing alterations. As a matter of fact, I just bought 
something in  one of the department stores, a
nd I had a pair of pants shortened, because I 
don™t have the -- the mach -- my
 machine is old and it doesn™t 
have some of the stuff that 
I need. And I -- I don™t sew any more, and I did talk to the -- the woman who fitted me. 
It™s -- I ask ed her -- she™s from Greece, I don™t kn
ow what her background is, and I let her 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
65
 
 
 
know that I was a fitter, cause the first one 
I had was terrible, was somebody new, new in 
the country and I knew she was not a fitte
r. A nd I asked for a real fitter. Anyway, she 
came and she said she was from Greece, and 
I let her know the training, and you know, 
my background. And I said I lu
ckily left it, because they  didn™t pay. And she did tell me 
that it pays mu ch better. I says, but not as 
well, probably, as the tailors, because the 
tailors supported the families, 
even if they did alteration, and she said yes, it was on the 
same par. So I guess things have changed. I 
don™t know which -- at 
which point in life, 
but at the time -- at the time I did alterations, I even -- I did well. The dress shop wh ere I 
had worked before I went to sc
hool, I -- they were paying a 
dollar and a quarter an hour, I 
got a dollar and a half. I ti -- he asked me to
 come and help. And I went -- A friend of 
mine, who was a secretary says, ﬁFrida,ﬂ 
she says --I was very nervous, very self-
conscious about becoming a secretary, I -- my  
foreign background, a
nd th is and that. And 
she said, ﬁGo on temporaries, that™s a good way 
to start.ﬂ And I got a job for one day at -- 
at a TV station. And I remember -- What 
did I make? In -- th -- Mr. Philips called me 

back. Oh , and I said, ﬁUnless you pay me two 
dollars an,ﬂ -- oh yeah, they were paying 
me two dollars an hour, temporary. I didn™t kno
w -- I didn™t do anything, I di -- and he -- 
he never -- he never took me, so -- and there 
were long layoff seasons. They weren™t fair 
in the way they were laying
 off people. M -- Talking small store, an d if I was five 
minutes late, I lost the five minutes. And I 
went to work for Univ ersity Hospitals, for 
some reaso n  or other, I don™t remember what 
I paid for bread yesterday, but I -- that was 
two dollars an hour, even at
 40 hours, which I didn™t put
 in, it would have been  80 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
66
 
 
 
dollars, and I was --what did I earn? Oh, wait a minute. I want -- I wa -- I was earning so 
much more it was unbelievable. I mean, ther
e™s no comparison, and like I say, and a -- I 
retired with a pension, which I -- I don™t know 
if the stores do it, and the small stores are 
slowly disappearing. They can™t
 su rvive with all the -- all th
is -- chain stores, so that™s 
what made me leave, I knew I had to support 
myself in a different way and I said, I don™t 

care what I do, I never, never want to face what
 I faced when my  son was seven year old, 
where I did not have money to 
go buy food to feed him. And 
it never happened  again, so 
I -- I -- I had illnesses, I had surgeries, I ne
ver lost a day™s work which wouldn™t have 
happened  in  those days in the sewing industry. 
And th e factories, th-the sewing factories, 
the garment far -- factory had sl
owly, over the years, moved 
south for -- for lower wages, 
and now, of course, they come from oversea
s, so I had to get out of -- of that 
environment. And whether the department 
stores pay better, I don™
t know. Sometimes I 
think I should wan -- go back fo
r a little bit part time, just to
 learn to deal with the new 
fabrics, and the new things. I still -- I still, 
I think, have a touch fo
r it. I went through a 
period where I sewed all my clothes, I™m very had to fit. But you can™t get the fabrics in 

Cleveland any mo re. There™s one fabric shop le
ft, but you da -- can™t get the fine wools, 
and the silks, and the -- I can™t even knit, 
because there are no knit shops. I can™t get the 
yarns, or anything like that. That
™s what I miss. But I have no regret that I went to -- to 
where -- to what I did, the environment was entirely different. 

Q: What year was your son born ? 
A: October 14, 1951. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
67
 
 
 
Q: And you were
 married when? 
A: I was married novem -- wait a minute, 
I was married Novemb er nine, 1946.  
Q: How did you meet your husband? 
A: A girlfriend went someplac
e, and my  husband was there and I don™t know, somehow 
or other, something came up about my  speaki
ng French , and he had 
studied French, and 
that™s how -- he called me, and that™s how
 I met him. I was goi
ng with someone from 
South Bend, Indiana at the time. I remember g o
ing by train to South Bend, Indiana. I had 

a distant cousin there, where I had spent so
me time, and I had met somebody. That™s how 
I met my husband, to a girlfriend -- through 
a girlfriend. And he called me because he 
had studied French, and he remembered. He 
has a fantastic memory. And that™s how I 
met h i m. 

Q: What was his profession? 

A: He was podiatrist. He was in school at 
the time. He was in school, he had two mo  -- it 
was supposed to be one year, a
nd the year he was there, he 
-- they extended
 the class to 
two years. And graduated, and 
he went into  podiatry. But in those days they were called 
chiropodists, and they didn™t 
have -- they were very limited
 on wh at they could do, you 
know. No su rgery, they couldn
™t even prescribe an aspirin 
or anything like th at. And we 
moved to  Sandusky and then ju st -- no matter 
how hard  he tried it, it never -- it never 
took off. That™s why we came back to Clev eland. His illness, and then whatever. And 

then I couldn™t go to work  in
 Sandusky because I was marri
ed to a doctor and I didn™t 
have a profession. And it was through somebody I had befriended th ere, that she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
68
 
 
 
suggested I do alterations at home, and I sa
ys, ﬁWait a minute, I don™t do alterations, I™m 
a dressma -- I know how to make a garment, 
but I don™t know alternations.ﬂ And it was 
through her -- I would make hems
 and things like that, and I ma
de a little bit of money on 
the side. And th at™s how I went into alterations
 when I came back to Cleveland, because I 
tried the sewing factory, but the sewing indu
stry was not the same, I couldn™t earn money 
or -- or anything like that. And I couldn™
t ear-earn enough to support my son. And 
eventually, the Social 
Security laws came out, so I was 
able to earn, and I got Social 
Secur -- just as I got my job at University Ho
spitals, I got Social Security for him and for 
my son, until he reached, you 
know, age where they didn™t gi
ve it. So that helped me, 
because I couldn™t -- I couldn™t survive on wh
at I was making. I was a -- making 80 -- 80 
something dollar -- 80 -- was it 8 6  dollars a we
ek, or something. 87.50, now I reme mb er, 
a week. As opposed to a dolla
r and a quarter, or a dollar a
nd a half an hour. And then I 
had benefits. I had sick days. 
And when -- I used to get sick
 every three weeks, not every 
month, I needed a day 
off. I was, you know, in bed. So, 
a-all together, it worked out very 
nicely. And it was a dif ferent environment. I 
never thought of going 
into an intellectual 
background, but it was marvelous. I mean, it wa
s very en lightening. We had wh at they 
call now Research Associate they call them. 
People who came from different countries 
for two years, to do research. 
So you had a very di
versified background, and it was very -
- it was very good, it was very enlightening,
 it was not backbreaki
ng, you know. If I had 
stayed in the sewing industry, I™m pretty sure
 I wouldn™t be even 
living here, even though 
it™s not high rent or anything. I would -- I w
ould be on subsidi -- I wo
uld have to be in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
69
 
 
 
subsidized apartments. Nothing wr
ong with it, I know a lot of people in it, but at least I™m 
free to come and go, and -- as I wa
nt, and live where I want, and --  
Q: [inaudible] 
A: Course, yeah, that came out of my tape, I know. I did not feel different at any time for 

being Jewish while I grew up in Belgium. 

Q: Mm-hm, yeah, that did come out. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: That did come out, because that is very true. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Go ah ead. 

Q: Well, I -- we were just talking a little bit 
off tape about your ex
perience in coming to 
the -- to the U.S. and I wondered if you woul
d talk a little bit about 
that again, about the 
religion question. 

A: Oh. Oh, I -- I knew I was co
mi ng to  a melting spot. I mean, I didn™t understand the -- 
the -- the real details, o r anything like that. I 
knew, even with the -- 
with the slavery, but 
didn™t understand the full extent of it, until 
I lived with it and was exposed to it. And 

when I would go someplace and fill out a -- wh
en I went to Lampole, which is -- was a 
sewing factory, one of the big 
ones in Cleveland, and I was 
shocked that they ask wh at 
my nationality was. And when
 I told -- I don™t remember who I told, my family, 
somebody, I said, ﬁI marked Czechoslovakia.
ﬂ And they said, ﬁYou 
should have said 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
70
 
 
 
Jewish.ﬂ I says, ﬁJewish is a religion, it™s 
not a nationality.ﬂ I had to argue wh-why are 
people so conscious of what religion so mebody 
is. I will discuss the differences if I have 
a-an -- an intelligent co nversation. I worked w
ith an Indian girl, you know, from India. I 
worked with a Black 
-- what they call a-an African Am
erican girl, and that was the 
beginning of -- where the -- the Blacks were, 
you know, being absorb ed, and things like 
that, and talk openly -- I will 
talk about it. But, people w
ill say to me ab
out somebody, 
ﬁAre they ja -- is he, o r is she Jew ish?ﬂ
 I says, ﬁIt never entered my  mind to ask.ﬂ 
Because I take a person the wa
y they are an-an-and I -- and I 
don™t think what are they. I 
couldn™t understand, also, why they  went into
 ethnic backgrounds, but I™m learning, I™m 
learning. It™s interestin g to find what is 
their background, you know, where their parents 
came from, because those are cu
ltures. That I can understand. We™ll discuss the -- I -- I 
would like to take a class in comp arative 
religion, because I don™t know anything ab out 
the Islamic religion, and I think 
it™s very interesting, they all have their points. And that is 
something that really amazed me, w -- and at
 the time, I did not 
understand what™s the 
difference what my nationality is, but now I understand. It™s just -- 
I just took a class on 
immigration, through th e elder campus atTri-C, and th e professor was very, very 

interesting. He happened to be Slov-Slov
enian? Yeah. And he had taught at Case 
Western Reserve and ev erything. And we 
reached a point about th e bilingual, the 
Span ish. And I told  him he opened my  eyes. 
I always felt, wait a minute, I spoke French, 
nobody bothered to have things
 translated in French, explai
n -- I had to learn English. 
Everybody who came had to learn English. And 
he pointed out to -- to
 us that Spanish,

you take Mexico, Texas, they were the Span
ish people, and the British were stronger, so 
the -- the English wa -- language prevailed,
 and ev erything Anglic
an took over. And I 
looked at him, and I says -- he said, ﬁOh, 
they didn™t emigrate. Th
ey were forced into 
becoming part of the -- you know, of ameri 
-- part of the United St
ates, and the English 
language was dumped into them, but that™s ta
king away what is right for them.ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁOkay, now I understand, now I™m willing 
to  accept that it should be, if necessary, 
bilingual.ﬂ First of all, it wouldn™t hurt, but 
you think, ﬁWait a minute, I barely spoke any 
English, I had to learn English.ﬂ But I can see 
their point, and I knew that the streets were 
not paved with gold, th at mu ch I knew. Ho
w hard it was to work, I don™t know, I was 
never made to [indecipherable
] work, the factory flabbergas
ted me, because there were 
rows of machines, and it was pi
ecework, and I was used to ha
ve one garment at the time, 
hand finished. I remember goi
ng with my  girlfriend Elaine shopping for clothes and wh at 
I used to do is turn everything
 inside out to see if it was fi
nished. And she didn™t want to 
go sh opping, because even in 
those days, everything, you kn
ow, was -- was u n finished on 
the inside. And I learned to -- to do piecework
. And th en you had the oil that went around 
constantly around the machine.
 They also had -- They  didn™t have a lunchroom, per se, 
they had a room wh ere you brought your lunch,
 and -- and you ate in that back room. But 
you have to realize in the sewing factorie
s, in the summertime,
 you work ed on winter 
clothes. Wool, the lint. And we always ch an ged clothes. I had wh at they call wrap 
around, they don™t see them any more. And I 
was just flabbergasted that that were the 
circumstan ces. I wanted to take up dressm
aking and dress designing again, and the

foreman, Mr. Harris, I reme mb er his name, sa
id to me, ﬁFrida, don™t waste your time in 
Cleveland, you have to go to
 New York .ﬂ And then I met 
my husband and I got married, 
so I never went thro ugh w
ith it. But I had learned thro ugh so mebody ab out Prinz 
beeterman. They  made suits and coats, and th
ey made a better garment. Some things were 
still finished by hand. And I had put an appli
cation in and I think I had put an application 
for hand sewing for some reason or other, 
and they never called me . And somebody -- I 
ran into somebody who said they were hired.
 So I re-contacted Prinz beeterman, and I 
went to work there where th
e conditions were much, much
 better. I made a lot more 
money by the hour. I was making a dollar someth
ing at Prinz beeterman, I went -- I mean 
at Lampoles. Went to Prinz beeterman, and I 
went up as high as three dollars something 
an hour piecework. And we ha
d a lunchroom and everything.
 So the -- the environment 
was entirely -- entirely different. It was white
r, it was cleaner. And you have to  realize, 
you wo rk ed in the sewing factory, sometimes
 it r eached a hundred 
degrees in the work  
room. I think one of the -- it was 
a si -- a knit factory, I can™t think of the name, they were 
not far from where we were on Euclid, and they
 moved in the suburbs, and they had air 
conditioning, but we didn™t. And then I was to ld at -- how bad it was -- I don™t know what 
years it was, where they had the fire in New 
York , in the garment factories, because of 
the condition and they didn™t car
e about their people. 
So these are the thi
ngs that -- I think 
that awed me that -- I 
don™t know. And then I used to th
ink, oh, I reached
 a point in my 
life I used to think, wonder what my life w
ould have been if I would have stayed in 
Belgium? I don™t think I would 
have struggled as hard as I did after I came to the States.

The hardest part, financially, 
was when my husband was ill a
nd hospitalized, first for six 
months, then he was all right for three years, 
went back into practic
e. I worked for him. 
An -- B-But the first time with no money -- 
I mean, no money. Two months behind in th e 
rent, utilities, you name it. And I 
had no one to turn to . I must
 say that the small Jewish 
community in Sandusky rallied, and so mebody cam
e to my -- to the house and ask me if I 
needed anything. As it is, I didn™t need it, 
because my husband™s brother gave us 500 
dollars, we -- which helped me overcome the 
worst of it, and then 
I sold the house. I 
didn™t make any money on it, but I salvaged
 some money and moved to Cleveland, which 
a -- I figured, I wonder -- the rent was 90 - 96 
dollars, and then th ey
 raised it 10 dollars. 
And I figured, as long as the money lasts, I™ll
 stay there. And it tu
rned out all right. My  
husband came out of the hospital, went into
 practice and we got on our feet, quote, 
financially, and managed to surv ive. And th en
 -- I wasn™t wealthy, but I was -- I had my 
head above water. And my concern was always
, I left an eight year old child at home 
alone wh ile I went to work . He had no way of
 reaching me at the fa
ctory. And luckily, it 
was through some friends who lived in the same
 complex, that I knew
 they kept an eye 
on Mark. Like, he came home for 
lunch, and I would prepare 
his lunch, and I had a little 
TV tray -- table so he could have it, and ye
ars, years later, I -- some people would made 
comment because he went to Kent State Univ
ersity, and when he™d come home, I would 
have a glass of milk, and I would have a sa
ndwich wrap ped, and pe
ople used to make 
comments about it, and I said, ﬁYou didn™t have
 what I had, where I had to leave a child 
to come home to an empty house.ﬂ I hate wh
en -- I -- I like when people have comments, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
74
 
 
 
and my  daughter-in-law teased for the long
est time, because Mark was terrible in the 
mo rning, I couldn™t get him out of bed. And th
e only way I could get him to sit up wa -- I 
used to squeeze fresh orange juice, and I 
would go and say, ﬁMar
k,ﬂ and I would hand 
him a glass of orange juice. And that got -- 
that got him sitting up in bed. But the -- the 
financial difficulties w ere really, really bad. 
I don™t think I thought 
of that time o f even 
going back or anything. I also -- There were 
some hard feeling that I n -- that I never, 
never cleared my mind, is my father adored 
children. He never came to see his grandson. 
I did want to go back , and they  offered me 
the fare for a boat or so mething, but I never 
told my  father that I didn™t have any mone
y and how badly I was 
struggling financially. 
When I went back a year afte
r he died, my uncle -- my father™s brother Josef was still 
living, and she said, ﬁWhy didn™t you ever
 tell your father?ﬂ And I guess I had too mu ch 
pride. I never told him, I never -- and I 
understand he died, he
 had established his 
business. My father died a well-to-do man, 
but I never -- I never asked for anything. I 
guess we were raised -- 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: Did you -- This is tape number three, side
 B. Did you ever see yo
ur father again then, 
after you left? 

A: No, I didn™t. It was a Friday, early in th
e mo rning, we lived in Sandusky, and I got a 
phone call, it was the telegram office. Didn™
t speak French. My uncle was sending me a 
telegram, and they said in Fr
ench, ﬁTon pere decee,ﬂ and th
at™s when I screamed, because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
75
 
 
 
they were saying my father was deceased, 
and I screamed, and my husband came to the 
phone. I had no money, I had no passport,
 and I never went, I never saw him again, 
never. And I went back a year later. And I we
nt -- I saw his widow. I found out that my 
father was very unhappily married. He ha
d imported a woman from Czechoslovakia. You 
know, must say this, when I 
came to the States, the Amer
icans thought Europeans were 
not discriminating because, well, we had a co
uple African from Belg
ium Congo, but you 
didn™t have the discrimination ag ainst the 
Black population, like here. But you wo nder 
why there is a war going on in Yugoslavia? 
My father wouldn™t have touched a Polish 
woman. The -- The Czechs di
dn™t like the Polish, the 
-- the Polish didn™t like the 
Lithuanian, I mean the -- i-i-it™s th -the ethni
c background, it™s amazi
ng, it does exist. And 
she told me he never wa -- ca
me. He walked  around with my
 mo ther™s pictures and my  
sister™s pictures. And I went in to see her 
because my  father had 
a ring from my mother, 
and I wanted it. And I thought, if she™s wear
ing it, I was going to take it. She wasn™t 
wearing it. And they had a couple things 
that were salvaged 
from -- I guess when my 
mo ther was taken away . I don™t even know 
who stored them, neve
r found out, never 
asked. An d I guess everything came, and I took the train back  to Brussels because my  

Uncle Josef had moved to Brussels, and the on
ly family I had was in Brussels. But I had 
gone to Liège because
 my father, very shortly, maybe 
two weeks before he died, had 
made out a will leaving everything to his 
wife. And I found out that in Belgium you 
cannot disinherit a child. S -- Th
r-Through a school friend in Liège, I -- with whom I was 
still corresponding, she got me a lawyer. I go
t a few dollars, not mu
ch. I did go back to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
76
 
 
 
Belgium, but I had to go to Br
ussels, because my uncle was th
ere, but the lawyer was in 
Liège. And of course, I walked in on my 
father™s widow, and she did not know I was 
coming. And I guess walking and seeing just
 a -- a couple personal 
belongings -- she did 
give me the linens my mother had made by ha
nd, I still have them, as her trousseau when 
she was a young girl. And I™ll never forget I 
went back  to Belgiu m and it was dusk, and I 
was sitting in the living room, and I was cryi
ng. And my aunt came in, and she says, 
ﬁWhat are you crying like an imbecile?ﬂ And I ju
st could not -- I could not relate to her. 
She™s -- I don™t know, she raves 
about her -- she™s crazy about her son, her daughter, I 
don™t know. And th -- She doesn™t have the 
warmth. And she went through -- after they 
started picking up th e Jews, they ended up in 
southern France. They  
did have a hard time, 
they didn™t go out to camps, because -- I reme
mber they said in on
e camp  they deported 
the Hungarians, so they said th
ey were Czech, and then  the other camp  they said deported 
the Czech, so they said
 they were Hungarian.
 So they managed to survive. They had two 
children. And I don™t know what kind of camp
s they were, because I never asked. Her -- 
My aunt™s family, she had a mother, a fa
ther, two sisters and a brother. When  the 
Germans invaded Belgium, they got on a train 
-- see, we tried to go to -- to France, we 
didn™t know they were going to invade Fran ce, her family got on a train, and the whole 
family was killed from the bombi
ng, from the Germans. But yet,
 when I fell apart at the 
seams and came back to Brussels, and I was cryi
ng. I just couldn™t -- I couldn™t explain to 
her, I was exposed to -- t-t-to -- to  -- to my wa
r years, to -- to -- to 
-- you know, living in  
the States, I put everything 
in the back. I -- I -- I guess ma
ybe I did it intentionally, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
77
 
 
 
didn™t think of those things. You push somethi
ng out of your way, push
 things out of your 
mind, didn™t face what really happened in th
e camps. And here I was, and I went back 
and all this faced me, and ev erything su rfaced,
 and she just couldn™t -- I don™t think she 
could appreciate it. So that™s the hard time 
I went thro ugh. And I did tell her -- she 
wanted to  know why I didn™t come as soon as
 my  father died, because we had a business, 
and his widow emptied th-th-the stocks and th
ings, so she didn™t pay the taxes the way it 
should, and I -- who even thought of it? As diffi
cult a ti me as I had with my father after 
the war, he was a fantastic father as childre
n. During the war he -- he -- we -- w e had 
everything. My father did Black Market. We ne
ver went hungry. He -- 
When he used to -
- to go to the farmers and brin
g eggs and butter and salt on hi
s bicycle, and -- and sell it. 
We never -- We never went hungry. So , what 
happened after, was the 
effect of whatever 
happened  to  him that maybe didn™t appreciate 
at the time. Now that I have th -- what I 

know is guilt feelings, because
 you survived, I th
ink maybe he had guilt feelings of 
having su rvived untouched. Maybe it would have 
been different if he had gone out to the 

camps and survived, I don™t know. But as I 
matured and got older 
and faced the truth 
what happened, maybe he had guilt feelings. I 
don™t know, he never talked about it. And 
then, when my Uncl
e  Gesa came, and I used to visit 
him quite often, I used to go to 
Denver about twice a year. Went
 with Mark, then went by 
myself. After surgery I went 
there. And I used to say to him, ﬁWhy didn™t he come to the States to see his grandchild?ﬂ 

And he ju st raised his shoulders and neve
r answered, so I don™t know -- I don™t know 
why he came. As a matter of fact, my cousin 
Miriam told me in Paris that he was very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
78
 
 
 
good to her. He was very good
 to her, and what happened, 
I don™t know. As children, I 
mean, we were provid ed fo r, we had caring pa
rents. I don™t wish  a
ny mo re on any other 
child. Financially, we didn™t have mu ch. I di
dn™t know what a doll was, I don™t think th ey 
ever bought me a doll. I th
ink the dolls I got was from th
e schools. The schools, at 
Christmastime used to give -- I remember I h a
d a doll. You have to  reme mb er they were 
the breakable dolls. And I rememb er I put it on 
the window sill, and there were some lu -- 
leftovers from the sewing my mother did, an
d the thing pushed th e doll away  and th e doll 
broke, but they never replaced it. Bicy
cles we had, because we need ed it for 
transportation. And after my accid ent -- I had an
 accident before we went into hiding. I 
went out to the country with my sister Bert
a and another friend, and I don™t know wh at 
happened, we went ou -- I re
member going uphill, and we had to walk and it was a hot 
day, and I wanted to  sit down, and I -- I can™t pl
ace it th is time if my 
sister said it, or the 
other girl said it, they say, ﬁOh, Frida, now the hill goes down.ﬂ And 
I got on the bicycle, 
and I rememb er as if yesterday -- I don™t reme
mb er if it™s my  sister or the other girl, 
yelled, ﬁFrida, you™re losing your pedals.ﬂ I 
fainted and I went down the hill in a fainted 
state. I guess th-the power of rolling down . A
nd I went into -- I don™t know if it was -- it 
was a building, I don™t know if it was a cas
tle. And it was somebody of aristocracy, and 
they brought me back 
with their chauffeurs, to the house. And I remember they gave my 
mother smelling salts, because one side of my
 face was damaged, and I must have had a 
slight brain concussion, because if somebody 
moved a chair or something, I couldn™t take 
the noise. And my  mo ther didn™t wanted me to 
ride a bicycle. My father went -- somehow 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
79
 
 
 
or other found a second hand bicy cle, so, 
you know, things were not produced , and I got 
another bicycle. So I had that accident, and then I had an  accident three days befo re my  
birthday, my  17
th
 birthday. Bu t wh atever could be pr
ovided fo r us, schooling, we had 
private tutors to help us more, but not the arts
, or mu sic or anything. 
First of all, I was not 
interested. Berta was, but I gue
ss they felt that it was not important, so we didn™t have it. I 
remember going to an opera with a neighbor. 
I went to see Faust. But they did not 
participate in the arts in any way.
 I never questioned it, never knew. 
Q: Is that an interest of yours now? Are -- Are you interested in -- 
A: Oh, I -- I like classical mu
sic and th e person who got me 
into it is my  husband, he™s 
very mu sically oriented. He play s the clar
inet. And he would put on classical music. 
When  I went to high school, I went to the 
extension, because the school was crowded, 
and behind us was the Co
nservatory of Music, it™s well 
known  in Europe. And then we 
would hear the students who we
re just learning. Do  you know wh at it sounds like when 
they learn? I had no desire, I had no intere
st, but now I do enjoy classical music , to a 
certain extent, I don™t like chamber music, I 
never learned to appreciate it. I haven™t 
learned to appreciate opera, 
although I did go to one at th
e Institute of Music, with 
somebody who lived  in one of the other build
ings here. But I ushered at Severence Hall 
with -- which is the -- you 
know, the Cleveland orchestr
a? And I do enjoy classical 
music, I go to it. I go to the art museum whenev
er there is an exhibit,
 when  we had the art 
shows, I love to walk  outside. If you have
 en ough time, you should go see the -- the 
museums, because Clevelandha
s a beautiful, beautiful Muse
um of Art, and Severance

Hall they™re just remo deling. I just signed up
 to volunteer when they reo -- they™re -- 
they™re going to  be playing downtown in one of
 the halls, but i -- they™re moving back in 
January, after the remodeling, a
nd I signed up to volunteer, so 
I am into classical music. 
My son played the trumpet, quite musically 
oriented. He gave it up when  he went to 
Kent, don™t ask me why. On e granddaughter is
 interested in dancing and mu sic, and she 
does play  the flute. The other ones, no. Bu t me
, I have no desire to play an instrument, 
and I enjo y certain types of mu sic, but it was 
not in our education or in our backgrounds 
or anything like that. 

Q: Did you go back to 
Belgium any other time? 
A: Yes. When my  uncle died in Denver, and tw
o years later, my  aunt 
died. I didn™t know 
at the time, but I was the execu
tor for both wills. On
e of the heirs, my aunts nephew, was 
in Bratislava in Czechoslova
kia, who was Communist at th
e time, managed to manipulate 
the money so the mo ney didn™t 
go into Czechoslovakia, and 
I was in correspondence with 
him. And somehow or other, I 
decided to go to Europe. Dr. 
Freide was in Switzerland at 
th -- at the time, in a -- in
 Zurich. And I was in correspondence with  him because there 
were still some strands left behind, and so 
on. And I wrote to him 
I was going to go to 
Czechoslo vakia, and he said, 
ﬁIf you go to Czechoslovakia,
 stop in Zurich, we™ll show 
you the mountains.ﬂ So  wh at I did, I traveled 
on my own. I went to
 Zurich. He did offer 
for me to stay with 
them and I said no. They got me 
a little hotel you don™t get through 
the travel agencies here, and Switzerland is ve
ry clean, so I got a room, and you could tell 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
81
 
 
 
the shower was added on. And I had breakfast 
and I took a couple trips. So I stayed in 
Zurich fo r two days, took so me 
trips, went to Bratislava. 
Q: What year was this? 
A: When  did my  uncle die? Let™s see, 20 -- [i
ndecipherable] died about 20 -- 22 -- about -

- a good 20 years ago. I don™t have my  pass
port and I don™t rememb er exactly the year, 
but it™s t -- about 20 years ago, and I went to
 Bratislava, which is 
Communist at the time. 
I had to have 10 dollars per day, couldn™t sp
end it, the stores were empty. And I stayed 

with my -- with Eugene and Magda, my a
unt™s nephew and niece. Didn™t see much. Sp en t 
a week there. Went from Bratislava to Bru
ssels, which was a waste of time. Willy, my 
cousin, took me to see the c
ity. I had spent three months in
 Brussels, I had no desire to 
see it, I didn™t do -- oh, I did take a trip into  the Flemish part, on my own. It was -- I have 

no -- I grew  up feeling as a Belgian citizen
 cha -- chain -- sang the national anthem, and 

then after I came to the States, I realized 
I really would have 
never been a citizen, 
although my father died shor
tly before becoming a citizen of
 Belgium. You don™t become 
automatically like in the States. A nd then I went from Brusse
ls, I went to Paris to see 
Frida and spend a week with 
her. And then I -- And then I 
came back here. And then, 
let™s see, did I go b
ack again? No, I was out, I never we
nt back. I have no desire to go 
back. I know Miriam said to me, ﬁWhy 
don™t you go work  for the common market. 
You™re bilingual.ﬂ By
 then I was losing 
my Fre -- when I say 
losing my French, I 
excelled in French, but to sp
eak two languages, and translat
e, are two different things. 
You need  a training and a background, and I 
have to stop and th
ink, ﬁHow do you say 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
82
 
 
 
that in French?ﬂ I finally met some people, qu
ite by -- was just a freak, I took the Rapid 
to go downtown and this woman sat next to
 me and she had a little 
brochure, and I says, 
ﬁOh, I didn™t know the Americans were in
terested in Moliere.
ﬂ And she happens -- I 
don™t know where she learned French, but she 
introduced me to a group, and they™re 
strictly women, we get -- they get together
 twice a month, at Beechwood Place, and from 
10 to  12, and then on Friday they  get toge
th er at somebody™s home, and ev erybody brings 
something, just for the purpo
se of speaking French. So I™v
e gotten back into speaking 
French, and it™s not a word of 
English, until you turn to so
mebody who just came back 
from France, who has close cont
act, and you say, ﬁHow do 
you say such and such in 
French?ﬂ No body could rememb er how to say fl
ush a toilet in French. And I read French 
books. I go down  to 
the library about once a month. Cleveland library downtown, the 
main library is magnificent. I have -- going to
 go down next week, I 
think, because they 
built a new building, and they 
re-did the old building, whic
h was closed, and I got to 
know -- they had a -- the foreign literature 
lib rary, and she just sent me a book. She 
knows the authors I like, or if she sees a 
book on Belgium, she™ll send it to me. One of 
them she sent me was all about the percentage
s of Catholic -- Cath -- Catholicism. Still 
have some word s with trouble. So I do th
at, and I do have the opportunity of getting 
together with people to speak French. And 
my granddaughters are taking Sp anish. Bu t 
they™re long distance, you know
, so it doesn™t make any differe
nce. As a matter of -- th -- 
Alicia called me, she said, ﬁI have to take 
a language, I don™t know what to take, maybe 
German.ﬂ And I didn™t want to tell her don™t.
 I did say, ﬁOh, [indecipherable] you don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
83
 
 
 
want German.ﬂ I said, ﬁ[indeci
pherable] to take French,ﬂ I 
said, ﬁbut take Spanish, it™s 
much more useful, you know, in the States.ﬂ
 So I don™t know wh
at she™s going -- she™s 
going to  do what she wants to do. She said 
something about taking Japanese, but she™s 
not going in to something where it would be 
required, so I don™t know. But I do speak 
French. I have very little opportunity to speak 
Yiddish, and I trip on 
my words, bring in 
the English words, because the older genera
tion is dying away, so the young people -- 
I™m sure my little sister probab
ly didn™t even speak Yiddish,
 probably unders
tood it, but 
the young generations don™t speak Yiddish. We
 have a lot of Russian emigrants, but the 
Russians are like the Germans, th
ey don™t speak Yiddish. Best 
of all, they couldn™t. Every 
so often I find th em, and I™ll say, ﬁDo you 
speak Yiddish?ﬂ So I can communicate with 
them. And maybe I™ll break down -- I think Wo
rkman™s Circle has classe s in Yiddish. 
Maybe I should go back to it, maybe it™ll come
 back. I just rememb er a couple letters of 
the alphabet. Don™t know what go
od it is, but I did read articles 
that in Israel th ey™re te -- 
teaching Yiddish . In my generation they al
ways said, ﬁA Jew can go anywhere, he™s 
never lost, as long as he speaks Yiddish .ﬂ Bu t it™s not true any mo re. In my  generation, 

when  I was young, yes. It did come in handy. 
I went to Israel twice, the first time on my 
own. I was going to  take a tour, and so me re
ason or other, I remember
 my cousin, the one 
who was in Belgium, as a so
ldier, I reme mb er his address. They  were pioneers on a 
kibbutz. And I wrote to him, and I said, ﬁI want
 to come to Israel, I want to take a tour, 

but I™d like to see you again and meet your fa
mily.ﬂ And he said, ﬁDon™t take a tour, 
come to the kibbutz.ﬂ So I went on my  own 
to  the kibbutz, I arrived on a Frid ay, before

sundown, and on Saturd
ay, my mother™s side of the fami
ly came. M y  mother had a niece 
in Belgium and she went to Is
rael. And through the family I 
got her sister™s address and 
they all invited me, which I didn™t accept, but they grabbed me off, and I was taken to -- 
to visit Israel. I took one tour, that was it.
 Everybody else took me around, and then I 
went on the kibbutz and lived on th e kibbutz, and got a taste, if you can, on a couple days 

at the kibbutz. Then I went back  a number of 
years later -- oh, that 
time I traveled by bus 
everywhere. It was marvelous, because you meet more people, you learn more. And I 

took a bus back from ji -- di -- fro m Jerusalem to the kibbut
z, and they dropped me off 
into the kibbutz, and my  uncle had shown -- my
 cousin had shown me, ﬁSee F rida, this is 
the street I live on.ﬂ And I said, ﬁSfee, you wa
nt me to remember? It™s in Hebrew.ﬂ So 
when I got off on the kibbutz,
 there was a man with a bicy
cle and he was a-a-an older 
man, and I looked at him, and I took a chan ce
, and he was one of the European s from that 
generation, who had gone to Israel, and I was ab
le to speak with him 
in Yiddish. So he 
took me to my  cousin™s house. The sec
ond time I went, I went as a volunteer fo r the 
army. I didn™t like the experience, and the thi
ng th at saved me is every weekend we were 

off, so I went to the differen
t -- to the various members o f the family . I didn™t tour as -- 
that much, this time. 

Q: A volunteer for the Israeli army? 

A: Y-Yeah, uh-huh. They needed  volunteers. That
 started during the -- one of the wars or 
something, where all their people were fighti
ng, and th ey need ed people, and things like 
that. And I ended up wo rking -- I ended up be
ing placed on a ca -- on an  army  camp  that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
85
 
 
 
was -- packed medical supp
lies for the soldiers. My cousin from Belgium, her 
granddaughter happened to be in  the army , ri
ght on th e next camp , next to it, where the 
soldiers were. Teela. She was an officer. A
nd she came and sh e found me, because I had 
written to them that I would be
 there. And we got a ride back to her house and then 
coming back we took a train a
nd we took a bus. Some experi
ence. So I stay
ed there for 
two week s. I didn™t extend my  trip, but I did go
 to my cousin™s kibbutz. And I just had -- 
something came up in Denver, and I was in c
ontact with what I call my  sabber cousin, 
who lived  in Denver. And he called me twice. I 
recognized his voice, they have a definite 
ang -- you know, they speak En
glish fluently. And he says
, ﬁWhy don™t you come to 
Israel?ﬂ I says, ﬁYou know, maybe you make me
 feel like going, but I want to see areas 
where I™ve never visited befo re.ﬂ So I decide
d to go to Iceland in September. I don™t 
know wha -- what I -- I understand is very beautiful terrain. Equador was very 

enlighten ing. People say Equador? What™s in
 Equador? Well, it™s d ifferent cultures. And 
that™s what I like to do. And whether I™ll go 
to eastern Europe, I don™t know. One t -- One 
-- One step at a time. F irst of all, I have 
to make sure -- I™m getting older. That™s why I 
walk, to keep my legs ac
tive, and make sure -- 
Q: Very lively. 

A: To a certain extent
, to a certain extent. 
Q: What year was it that you went to
 Israel, volunteering with the army ? 
A: You know, you™re aski -- I would have 
-- I think maybe my passport shows it. Let™s 
see, I went to France last year, da --

Q: Ball park figure. 
A: Yeah, okay. Maybe five years ago. 
Q: And did you -- did you s -- s -- tell me a
bout your visits with
 Rachelle when  you 
returned. 
A: Ah, the first time I went. Wh
at happened is, I went to Isra
el the year after I went back 
to Belgium again. When I went Switzerland, 
and that. And my aunt in Belgium was the 
same age as Rachelle. My aunt didn™t like Ra
chelle either. And sh e gave me Rachelle™s 
name -- she had remarried, and her address. A
nd I wrote to Rachelle, and some reason or 
other -- trying to  reme mb er if I didn™t get an
 answer, somehow or ot
her, I got the answer 
three months later. I found the letter after I 
came back. And everywhere I went, I kept 
saying, there is somebody I want to see, but 
I can™t read the Hebrew  telephone books. 
And I ended up at a cousin™s house that I 
had not met before. They  were brothers and 
sister s from the one who lived 
in  Belgium, and I didn™t know th ey were brothers and 
sisters. And I was at Leelee -- Leelee™s house, 
on th e outskirts of Tel Aviv , as a matter of 
fact, and I says, ﬁLeelee,ﬂ I says, ﬁI need -- I 
want to get in touch 
with Rachelle, but I 
can™t read the telephone,ﬂ and she says, ﬁOkay.ﬂ Somehow or other, I don™t know if she 
called information, she looked 
in the phone book, I don™t re
member. And I say, ﬁI can™t 
call on my own, because I don™t speak Hebrew
, and th e Europeans who had gone, did not 
speak English.ﬂ Now they all -- all -- all the 
Israelis speak English. And she got on the 
phone one evening, and in Hebrew, and sh e sa
id, ﬁFrida, it™s the right Rachelle.ﬂ And I 
got on th e phone, she was crying. And wh at I di
d is I took a bus and I stayed with her. I

did not sightsee, I did not do
 anything. And I remember, h ad a dress with a little breast 
pocket, and I was going to a kibbutz on th e ou
tskirts of Jerusalem. These close friends 
that I have, who live on the west side of Clev
eland, had two daughters
 who were in Israel 
for several months on kibbutz, 
and I had to ld, I says, ﬁSally,ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t care what, I 
want to see Cindy and Sharon.ﬂ And one lived 
in a remo te kibbutz that was just being 
established. My cousin Sfee borrowed a car a
nd to ok me there and just visited for a short 
time. But Sharon was in a kibbutz where I had 
access with a bus, and Rachelle put me in 
a cab, and I reme mb er she gave me money to 
pay fo r the cab, and I says, ﬁRachelle,ﬂ I 
says, ﬁI™m not a child any mo re
, I™m an adult. I have money,
 I can afford.ﬂ She insisted. 
And she spoke -- I don™t know if she picked  up
 some Arabic, or it was in Hebrew, she put 
me in cab to Tel Aviv
, because all the buses leave from 
Tel Aviv. And I got to Tel Aviv, 
it was -- my son had warned me, it was like letti
ng lions out of a cage. Saturday evening, 
the Sabbath is broken, and all the buses were 
lined up right behind 
the other. I mean, the 
station has been remo deled since, when  I we
nt the second time. And I had th e name of 
the kibbutz written down on a piece of pape
r, until I learned to say kibbutz malach 
hameeshem, but at the time I couldn™t. And 
I missed the bus. With all those bus, you 
know, with the cab driver dr
opped me off, and I guess I miss
ed my bus. And this soldier 
approached me, it was very interesting even
t. The soldier saw me, 
y ou know, with a little 
suitcase, an d he approached me, and I told 
him where I was going. It happened to be he 
was in the -- once they se
rve in -- they have to back in 
the reserve once a year, until they 
reach a certain age. He was a young French
man who as a -- who had survived a war

younger than I wa -- he was younger than -- 
you know, about my  ag
e, I think. And he 
went to Israel after the war, and it s -- turns out
 that his wife™s name was also Frida, and 
he stayed with me in Tel Aviv, until I got on 
the next bus. Told th
e bus driver where I 
was going, and what happened, 
the kibbutz as a business had a -- a mo tel. Well, the bus 
went to the mo tel and they had a cop --

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: So, tape four, side A, and 
you just -- I have a cramp in 
my knee. [indecipherable]. Do 
you want to finish that story? 
A: All right, I went -- I went to the -- to 
the American wi -- common because I had told 
Sharon, I says, ﬁGet me a room at the mote
l.ﬂ She says oh, she went and th ere was a 
room available for me. Didn™t have a closet
, the shower -- the wa
ter was cold. And the 
next day, I went to take a bus to sightsee 
Jerusalem, because I only had one day, and I 
missed the bus to take me 
into Jerusalem. And there wa
s a man there who was from the 
outsk irts of Detroit, and he had lived at 
the kibbutz for ab out seven years, and I got 
talking to  him, waiting for the next bus. And he 
said he took groups of students o-on -- on 
-- sightseeing and th ings like that
. And he had an appointment,
 and I met him -- he says, 
ﬁI™ll meet you at the bus station at 11 o™clock,
 and he walked me for 
three solid hours, in 
Jerusalem.  And the one day I didn™t sights
ee was when I spend th
e day with Rachelle. 
When  I went back th e second time, I wrote to her, never got an an swer. I told somebody 

her address, couldn™t find it, and I know the let -- I don™t know wh at happened  to  

Rachelle. Have no idea, have no idea what ha
ppened to  her. It breaks my  heart, because 
he husban d had died. Her -- Y
ou know, the man she -- she marri
ed  in Israel. S o  I don™t 
know what happened, I tried in
 the worst way. I don™t know if I could have contacted an 
agency or what. I still
 -- I still have her address and n
odob -- nobody seemed to locate the 
street or anything. So  I™ve lost contact with  her. I still have contact with my  aunt in 
Brussels. I send her Jewish New Year™s card. I™m
 in touch with Frida 
in Paris. And I do -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

I have contact with my mother™s
 side of the family, the daug
hter of the cousin who lived  
in Belgiu m, I send a New Year™s card. As a 
matter of fact, my  granddaughter Alicia, the 
oldest one, went to Israel, and she did spen
d time -- her name is also Rachelle, my dau -- 
my  cousin from Belgium, her daughter, she 
spent some time with 
her. My cousin Ahoud, 
and Ruth , my  sabber cousin, happened  to be in
 England at the time. I wrote to them, and 
then I got a letter from England that he was 
stationed th ere on his job for a couple of 
years. And I told her I™ll neve
r forgive her for not going to 
see my cousin Sfee, because 
he™s elderly, I™m the only relative he has.
 But it™s not somebody I cou -- have lot of 
correspondence, and I can™t get 
through to -- now that they ha
ve telephones in -- in the 
kibbutz, I did call one time, and for some
 reason or other, I don™t know wh at has 
changed, I can™t get -- I can™t get ahold of 
them on the telephone. 
And my  sabber cousin, 
Ahoud, is the same cousin as I am, and 
I -- I should ask him for his phone number, I 
don™t know. I have to call him one of these 
days and see if he can give me a phone 
number. 
Q: What™s Sfee™s last name? 

A: Well, Nishri, N-i-s-h-r-i, and you know, agai
n, we go back ma -- not asking questions 
now. He is a first cousin to my father. He le
ft at a young age, he married a woman, I think 
she™s of Polish background. I never asked 
him about my  grandparents. I would assume 
that his last name, European, was Adler. I mean
, he™s on my father™s side of the family, 
but when  I was there, his hearing was going, 
his eyesight was going. He was sti ll clear  
minded. I haven™t heard anything, his wife wa
s still very active. She was a mid w ife, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049

he -- when I went there, he used to go to -- 
to the fields, and bring food to th e people wh o 
worked t-the fields, a-at the kibbutz, and I we
nt with him. They treat
ed me -- I mean, they 
didn™t know wh at to do with me. If I had a 
-- a -- you know, they  have the main meals in -
- in -- in the common dining ro om, but Ahoud 
and Ruth  came, and sh
e served some soup, 
and she used to bake. If I as 
mu ch as picked up the cup to put it to the sink, she would 
slap my  hands, she wouldn™t let me do anything.
 She was so glad that
 I was in touch -- in 
touch with them, and that™s the only contac
t I have. And Miriam I d on™t hear from. She 
was in the States on business, and she was 
in New York, but she 
didn™t tell me until the 
last minute, so I couldn™t go to New Yo rk, 
and I did get a letter from her mo ther, saying 
she was due to come to the States, I don™t know
 if it was Chicago or what, and I had told  
her, I says, ﬁMiriam, if you let 
me know ahead of time, then 
I™ll come, I™ll stay in a hotel 
and I™ll spend time with you.ﬂ Well, I don™t kn
ow if she didn™t come, she didn™t contact 
me. She did contact me when sh e was in Ne
w York. And I had it to -- a hard ta -- she 
kept changing hotels, so I had a hard time tr
acking her. My  aunt came to the States one 
time, many years ago, when  my  son lived  in 
Connecticut, and he and his wife went to 
New Yo rk, they drove and met her, because 
she went to  visit somebody from Belgium, 
and the woman spoke English, and I guess Fren
ch, and she was a tran
slator. And th en she 
came -- it was interesting, sh
e came a second time, but she 
didn™t tell me until the last 
minute. She went to Florida, to somebody. 
And I say, ﬁWhy didn™t you tell me? I was 
going to  Florida once a year to visit friends.ﬂ
 But I never saw her. It was too late, and I 

wasn™t going to pay the high fare of the last minute fares to go to -- to -- to flori -- she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
92
 
 
 
was in Miami and I was going to Fort Lauderda
le. So I have no contact with any of them. 
I had a cousin in Los Angeles, I vi -- my a
unt, the one from Denver™s daughter, lived in 
Los Angeles, I spend time with her. I have a 
cousin too, that I met after the war, who 
lived in eng -- in Cleveland, 
went to Los Angeles, and I do have contact with one of the 
cousins in Canada. But otherwise 
-- and one of them here in -- 
two of them, I -- actually I 
somehow or other re-made contact with Lana™s
 daughter, to a certain extent. Louie died  
many years ago, with  a -- of a brain tumo r, so
 -- but from my father™s generation, from -- 
you know, from -- there™s 
a -- Sfee™s the only one in Israel  from that generation, really. 
There is no one else left, no one else. And on 
my mother™s side -- o n  my father™s side, 
that generation, everyone was gone. On my  
mother™s side -- oh no, wait a minute, on my 
mother™s side, one uncle had re
ma ined, their two girls and my  cousin Paul in Cleveland. 
And I understand he was one of the oldest 
survivors of the camp , and he stayed in 

Czechoslovakia, Romania, every time there™
s a war, and every time they divide the 
country, it becomes another country. I wa
s Russian after  World War Two, now it™s 
Ukraine. And he eventually cam
e to the States, but his mind was not -- he was in his 70™s, 
he had gone through World War 
Two, he was in a nursing home. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: Izaquavic. What was it? Oh, all of a sudd
en I can™t think of his name, and I met him, 
and he -- the only way 
he could know who I 
was is by telling him whose daughter I was. 
You -- Because he remembered my
 moth -- you know, that™s th
e way they said, they said, 
so and so ™s daughter, so and so™s
 son. Oh, all of a sudden -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049
 
 
93
 
 
 
Q: How --  How was he related? 
A: My mother™s father. 
Q: He -- Oh. 
A: My mother™s -- excuse 
me, my mother™s brother. 
Q: Oh, okay. 

A: Yeah, he was the only sa -- survivor on
 my mother™s side, from that generation. 
Q: And when you said he was one of 
the oldest survivors of the camp -- 
A: Of the camps, he -- 

Q: -- which camp -- which camps? 
A: Who knows how many camp s he was in, I have
 no idea. I think he ended up in -- I -- 
he might have been in  Auschwitz when  he 
was liberated, I -- I -- I -- I don™t know. You 
know, these are the thi
ngs we didn™t ask. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: You know, this is going back -- oh, I know
 what his name was. The Jewish name was 
Moishevolv. No w I rememb er. And I met him, but 
he could only relate to me  of saying I 
was Hya™s daughter. And he stayed
 with the su -- with -- with
 the -- the son, he stayed 
with the -- with the daughter. I 
don™t know, he died, I think of a heart attack. He was in a 
-- on a picnic or something like that, so he 
didn™t live very long after he came to the 
States. And that™s about it, 
I mean, nothing else, really.

Q: Is there anything else that you -- that you 
want to say in conclu sion? I mean, I™m just -
- I™m thinking of one statement that you said th at sticks in my  head , is that you said, you 
know, that you haven™t lived a full life, a
nd I -- I wondered what you mean by that? 
A: You mean a full life now? Well I -- You 
know, my -- my -- my 
children live out of 
town, and you know I was raised 
to -- to -- to be a mu -- to be married, to have a -- a-and 
be a mo ther and everything, and so I live al
one, so I don™t ha -- well, I don™t have the 
male comp anionship. I dated. I -- I went out 
a lot, I -- I had male 
companionship for -- for 
quite a number of years. You reach my age, 
and I™m too active for some of them. I™m still 
fairly active. And I™m thankful that I have th
e friends that I have, that I can keep busy. I 
volunteered. I just lost my  job vol
unteering, I have to find another one. I did date entry. I 
go back to the hospital and talk
 with Dr. Gambetti. I keep 
active and I keep busy, what 
can I tell you? And I started taking classes beca
use I want to keep my  mind work ing, and 
I have to find a niche for my 
volunteer work, because the woma
n I work for is fantastic. I 
still have contact with her, and 
I go there for the holidays. As
 a matter of fact, she called 
me this morning and I said
, ﬁThe museum?ﬂ I says, ﬁWe
ll,ﬂ I said, ﬁI wanted the 
mu seum, there™s an exhibit.ﬂ And I say I want
 to go down to the 
library, because I was 
not available the day they had the grand open
ing fo r the old library
, they remodeled the 
original building. So we™re goi
ng to the library w
ith her. So I™m thankf
ul for the -- that 
I™m quote, healthy. That I have the friends th at I have and I™m not isolated, and if I don™t 
have to sp end 10 years in a nur
sing home, I™m fi -- I™m fine 
financially, too, but I™m tha -- 
can™t worry about it. And my son is doing 
well, and the children are growing up, away

from me. T h at™s the thing, that I missed it. No
t now so much, but when
 they were little, is 
to see them, you know, grow up
, but they were here four tim
es a year, and I went there, 
so -- and I went wh en Alicia had -- the oldest
 one had her tonsils out. But I missed a lot 
of the little things, you know, affairs in sc
hool. Oh, Whitney was acting in  some plays, 
and I went because she had a play, but it™s not
 -- it™s not as often as I would have liked. 
But all that is gone, so ha
ve to take it from here. 
Q: Anything else you want to ad d? 
A: No. 

Q: All right. Thank you so mu ch. I think 
we could probably go
 on all day, but -- 
A: No. 

Q: I™ll spare you from that. 

A: Yeah, yeah, well you™re th
e one who keeps bringing all th
ese things up. I don™t know 
how you do it. Aren™t you tired? 
Q: Endlessly curious. 
A: You mean, you™re going ba
ck tonight? You™re goin g --
