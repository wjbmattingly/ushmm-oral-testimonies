Tape 1 
Question: Good morning.  
Answer: Good morning. 

Q:  It™s finally ni ce to see you here in Wa sh
ington, after all these mont
hs of waiting. So, thank 
you for coming. Lucille, let™s just start ve
ry simply tell me  when you were born. 
A:  February 1
st
, 1925. 
Q:  And where were you born? 

A:  I was born in Ha mburg, Germany. 

Q:  And your name  at the time  of your birth. 

A:  Cecilia Landau. 

Q:  So, it was Cecilia all through your 
childhood. When did it become  Lucille?  
A:  When I came to New York, and the abbrevia
tion for Cecilia was Cilli
e, and in English it 
sounds ﬁCillieﬂ. So, somebody talked Œ talked me  
into changing the name  to Lucille, Cecilia, 
and I should have just left 
it Cecilia, but it was too late. 
Q:  So, do you think of yourself as 
Cecilia when you think about yourself? 

A:  No, not really, but some times when s o me body sa
ys, ﬁLucille, come  here.ﬂ I don™t hear it. If 
some body would say, ﬁCeciliaﬂ I would hear. 
Q:  So, should I call you Lucille? 

A:  No, Lucille is fi ne. 

Q:  Okay.  

A:  That™s fine.

Q:  Lucille, let™s talk a little
 bit about your fa mily. Tell me  about you™re growing up. So, first I 
want to know what was your fathe
r™s name  and your mother™s name? 
A:  My father™s name  was Benno Landau, short fo
r Benjamin. My mother name was Sala Landau 
before that it was actua
lly Sala Baumwollspinner. 
Q:  Very long name . 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  And where did they meet? 

A:  They met shortly after the First World War,
 in Cottbus, Germany, where my mother™s older 
brother had established a wine import-export
 business and wa s very successful. And, my 
mother Œ my  father was already in Vienna a
nd in Germany. M y mother came  from Sa mbor, 
Poland, because she was already in her late 
20s, and there was no suitable suitor who came  
knocking. So, my grandmother sent her Œ she was 
the youngest of eight or ten children Œ to 
Cottbus hoping she would find a husband. 
Q:  And she did? 

A:  She did, because my father worked
 for her older brother as a salesman. 
Q:  Tell me  wha t  growing up with them was like. I know you we re born in 1925. So, you don™t 
have to talk about the first couple of year
s unless you actually have a me mory. What was 

home  life like for you? 
A:  It was very predictable. 
It was very mi ddle class. It was very secure. It wa s very 
unpretentious, although there was a ma id for the 
children and a ma id for the house, and we 
went on nice vacation. There were music less
ons and English lessons and dancing lessons. 
But we took it for granted. My parents were rath
er strict Œ strict in
 terms of schooling, of 
grades, strict when I didn™t practice violin. Ch
ildren had to be seen 
but not heard. When my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417

parents discussed personal things or business events, they would speak Polish. I did not 
understand. When they talked to me  and later on to my sister, it was in German. 

Occasionally, they would speak French, but not
 ve ry often. It was Œ it was a nice childhood. 
The me mories I have until 1933, when I was eight, are warm and they are loving. I really 

could not fault my parents for anything other than 
that were really very, very strict and very 
dema nding. It was very important 
that a report card had an ﬁAﬂ, ma ybe a ﬁBﬂ, but anything 
below that was not acceptable. 
Q:  What would happen to you if–? 

A:  Nothing would happen, but there would be re
primand, there would be a conference with the 
teacher, and after ™33, when the grades slippe d 
considerably, then there was a different tutor 
every afternoon Œ one for German, one for Math
, one for English, one for French, and the 
grades did improve. Wh at my parents did not 
consider was that the outside world had an 
influence on children. They told 
us that things would change. 
It would not rema in this way. 
The neighbor™s children would begin to play wi
th us again. The boys would no longer beat us 
up on the way to school. It would Œ life woul
d norma lize. They didn™t say exactly when, but 
they were very reassuring and very convinced 
that there would be a pol
itical change. And my 
parents, of course, could not
 vote in German elections. Th
ey never became naturalized 
German citizens. They didn™t want to. We  went 
to Poland quite frequently to see the family, 
to see Grandmother, and what I heard in 
Poland as a very young child was that you, in 

Germany, are complaining about anti-Semitis
m. You don™t know what it™s like in Poland. 
Your economic conditions do not compare to ours. To me , it did not ma ke sense. 
Q:  You didn™t understand what they were saying? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417

A:  No. I could not comprehend. My grandmothe
r spoke Polish. She spoke Yiddish to me , and I 
answered in German, but  I really did not comp
rehend. The family in Poland was well-off, but 
nothing compared to life in Germa
ny. For instance, the streets in 
this little town were not Œ 
the streets were dirt streets, and when thepeasants were pushing their wagons through the 
main street of the town, they took their shoe
s off because it was muddy, and I could see their 
feet with the Œ with the mud 
oozing through the toes. When we 
arrived by train in Poland, we 
were picked up by a cousin with a horse a
nd buggy. We ll, I would not go into the buggy Œ 

not with a horse in front of it that was moving. I 
was used to a black taxi
 with white stripes. 
So, these things I reme mber. I reme mber them 
warmly. I Œ I reme mber that, and I appreciate 
that, I had a part of that cu
lture, because it ended too soon. 
Q:  Your father rema ined Œ he was in the wine 
business. He was a wine importer. Was he home a 
great deal, or did he travel? 
A:  No, he didn™t travel at all. 
Q:  He didn™t travel? 
A:  No, no. He had traveling salesman, and he 
was home  continually. He came  home for  lunch 
time. He went with us on vacations every summe
r. It was usually a month or six weeks. How 
well the business did, I never knew. I was never 
told. I had a small allowance, probably of 50 
cents a month. I didn™t need anything, and I 
was not allowed to buy frivolous items. The 
clothing for the kids was custom ma de.  
Q:  Was that unusual?  Th
e mi ddle class that you were- 

A:  Middle class and upper-mi ddle 
class it was custom ma de, yes. In those days, a ma n did not 
buy ready-ma de suits. There were ha rdly any. I 
we nt to a pr ivate Jewish school. The teachers 
were Œ at that time  Œ in their 
late 50s, and to me  terribly old. 
They were very strict and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
5 
 
 
were very orthodox. You had to adhere to the 
rules and regulations. On Saturday, you didn™t 
take a streetcar. You didn™t write. You did 
not carry a purse. You pinned your handkerchief 
to your jacket. You learned Hebrew
, post-modern Hebrew. You learned 
Humash and 
Gemora
 and you had to translate. 
It was ma ndatory, five days
 a week. School was not a 
happy experience. It was very rigi
d, very regime nted, very Ge rman in spite of the fact that 
the teachers were all Jewi sh, very dema ndi
ng and it lacked compassion, understanding for 
the children. We  were told going home  on the str
eetcar to stand in the back, to be quiet, not 
to talk loudly, not to draw 
attention, and I reme mber sayi
ng one day, ﬁThey want us to 
become  invisible. How does one do that? ﬂ 
Q:  And who did you say this to? 
A:  I said it both to my parents and to 
some friends, because I could not understand the 
restrictions. I could no
t understand what I had done to 
deserve the punish
me nt of being 
beaten up on the street or having stones thrown 
at me  or obscene name s. I did not Œ I did not 
realize the impact, and I believe d at th
at point, that it would change.  
Q:  So, is your me mory that 1933 creates a real 
change for you, when you™re eight years old?  Is 
that how your me mory-  
A:  It™s between ™33 and ™36. 
It was over a three-year period. 

Q:  Let me  go back to your pare
nts for just a mo me nt. Did you feel
 closer to one
 parent more 
than another?  Or were they both very similar for you? 
A:  They were very similar both in backgr
ound, in education, in upbr
inging. I would say my 
mother was more reserved. She never contradict
ed my father. She agreed with all of his 

decisions. I think I can only recall two times 
when she disagreed. She came  home one day 
and had cut off her long black hair which was ti
ed to the top of her head, and she came home 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
6 
 
 
with a fashionable bob. And the other thing sh
e did Œ which was before I was born, but I 
heard the story Œ during the inflation, under the 
inflation of 1922, she pawned her silver to 
keep the business afloat, and she did not ask pe
rmission. Aft e r the business prospered, she of 
course got it back, but I think 
during the mi ddle ™30s, early ™30s, 
she deferred him in all other 
decisions. I did not know at that time that my 
father bought commercial 
real estate. It was 
never me ntioned. The decision was ma de betwe e
n my father and my mother™s brother, 
younger brother, who was an associate, but we 
had no idea about it. We  mi ght have picked 
up a word or two, but we would have
 never asked. That wasn™t done. 
Q:  So, when you would sit at lunch Œ I assu
me  you ate lunch together with your parents. 
A:  At two o™clock. 

Q:  At two o™clock, or dinner, would you Œ and af
ter your sister was born and she became a little 
bit older, she was born in 1930, I think- 
A:  Right. 
Q:  Were you supposed to sit there very quietl
y and they would carry 
on the conversation, or 
would people ask you questions abou
t what had happened at school?   
A:  There were very few questions
 at the dinner table. The ma id 
would some times bring in a dish 
or plates, and then the language would imme
diately switch to Polish. We  were asked 
questions about school, but not ne
cessarily at the dinner table. It was when it came time  to do 
home work, or when you wanted to postpone ho
me work and the answer was, ﬁNo, home work 
first.ﬂ It was a typical education of the ™30s wh
en you had to be within 
the role of a child, not 
have the freedom of being light-hearted or 
joking or tell funny stories. It wasn™t done. 
Q:  But you seem to reme mber it very fondly. 
A:  Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417

Q:  In spite of the restrictions. 
A:  Yes because it was very secure. It was very 
predictable, and it gave us a sense of belonging. 
It gave us a sense of being cared for. It ga
ve us a sense of neve
r mi ssing anything. Anything 
that was necessary for a norma l life or a sati
sfactory life was provided. You didn™t have to 
ask for it. 
Q:  Were you happy when Karin was born? 

A:  Yes, I was delighted. 

Q:  Did that mean that you had a place, even
 though she was so much younger, to laugh and be 
liked?  I mean, did it give you so
me thing that you hadn™t had? 
A:  We ll, I wanted a sist er, and I put a cube of
 sugar on the windowsill so the stork would come 
and take the sugar and bring 
a sister. Yes, we played, even though there was a five-year 
difference. She was very fast, very bright, and 
very pretty, and when she started school, I had 
to listen, ﬁWhy can™t you behave like your sist er?  Why can™t you be as intelligent as your 
sister?  Why do you have to talk out of turn?  
Why can™t you bring home  A™s like your sister? ﬂ  
And that was a little diffi cult. 
Q:  So, were you a little bit re
bellious in that household? 
A:  Maybe not in the household, but definitely at
 school. At school, I got
 into trouble here and 
there. 
Q:  How so? 
A:  I would talk out of turn and we organized 
some  pranks for teacher. I could think of putting 
thumb tacks some  place, or put some  glue on the chair. Or, when it™s later on, when the 

physics professor said, ﬁTurn the Bunsen burne
r on low,ﬂ I turned it on high, and all the 
windows blew out, and my dad had to pay for ne
w windows. So, I had my  share of troubles.

Q:  Did your parents explain about
 the Nazis, or simply said there was a change of governme nt?  
Did you see things in the street? 
A:  Yes, I saw the uniforms - first the brown uni
forms with the red arm bands and the hats, which 
was called the SA. We  s a w the children in 
uniform, young children Œ white shirts, brown 
skirts or trousers, and sort of a brownish n
ecktie. We did not see ma ny other uniforms at that 
point. The green uniforms ca me  much later.
 The local police wore greenish uniforms. 
Q:  Wait one second. The noise is rea
lly too much. Okay, I™m s orry, go ahead. 
A:  The precinct police wore green uniforms and 
those silly helmets, but
 they were separate. 
Each precinct had a Œ each living area had a 
precinct and it was ma ndatory that when you 
moved into an apartment or into
 a house that you register at 
the precinct Œ name , address, 
occupation, tax id number, and religion. When 
you decided to move from A Street to B 
Street, you went back to the precinct. You to
ld them where you™re moving to. You went to 
the new precinct, and you went through the pr
ocedure agai n. This system still exists in 
Germany and in France, and this was probably on
e of the reasons that you could keep tabs on 
people. 
Q:  But you clearly experienced a difference in te
rms of when you said that you felt, on the one 
hand, you™re invisible, on the other hand, pe
ople know you™re Jewish, and you™re receiving 
all sorts of punishme nt of one 
sort or another. So, you™re both 
invisible and not invisible at 
the same time. 
A:  Well, I was visible, but the 
adults wanted me  to be invisi
ble, not to draw any attention. 
While, on the other hand, we took the punishme
nt regardless of where we stood, where we 
walked or what we did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417

Q:  And when you would come  home having b
een taunted or beaten
 up, your parents would 
know this?  
A:  Yes, and could tell it by the dirty clothing 
because it was soiled from the stones and from the 
dirt that they threw at us. Some
times, it would be a black eye.  
Q:  So, it was really bad. 
A:  It got pr ogressively worse.
 At first it was taunts and remarks, and then it became physical. 
But they tried to comfort  us, but I think, as ch
ildren, or as growing children, we were afraid 
and became subsequently more so.  
Q:  So, you became much more afraid? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  Of a lot of things, right? 

A:  Yes, yes. 

Q:  So, did you then retreat into yourself?  Di
d you stay at home more than you used to? 
A:  I stayed at home  more, or
 some body had to bring me  to a friend™s house or pick me  up. I 
started to draw and paint a great deal. My grades
 slipped terribly, and that™s when mos t  of my 
spare time  was occupied with tutors. The 
grades improved, but I don™t think the happiness 
changed or the unhappiness changed.
 I would have like to leave 
the country like ma ny of my 
school friends, but my parents saw no reason to 
leave because, in their eyes, we were for mer 
nationals. We had the protection of anothe
r governme nt and we were untouchable.  
Q:  Did they say this to you? 

A:  Yes, yes.  

Q:  Now, how was Karin, your younger sister, 
responding?  Equally f
earfully, or was she- 
A:  No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
10 
 
 
Q:  She wasn™t? 
A:  She was not. She was some how able to ignor
e it, to shut it out, and she was probably less 
molested because she wa s blond and curly-haired at
 time s. I had dark hair. I was older. It did 
not seem to bother her, or ma ybe she was so
 muc h younger that she did not get the impact 
from the beginning. She grew into it. When she star
ted school in ™35, this is
 the way it was. It 
hadn™t just changed overnight. 
Q:  Did you talk with her, 
once she started school?  Did you ta
lk about what was happening? 
A:  No, I never did. We  talked about the teachers.
 We talked about grades. We did silly things. 
We would hide things or play tricks on our 
parents, or when my 
mother was looking for a 
pair of shoes, and one shoe was mi ssing. We  sh
ared a room. The two beds were divided. In 

the mi ddle was a big wardrobe. We  had dolls an
d dolls™ carriages, and we played like norma l 
children in a home . She had her friends. I had 
mi ne. But as we grew older, there was less 

interaction. 
Q:  How did your fears affect you, besides the grad
es?  We re you able to sleep?  Wa s it disturbed 
sleep? 
A:  I was dreaming a great deal. When my parents 
would go in the evening to
 a concert or to the 
theater, to the opera, and the ma id
 would stay with us, they normally took a streetcar or taxi. I 

would not sleep until they got home, and it 
was sometimes one o™clock in the morning. I 
couldn™t. It was just fear Œ f
ear of some thing that I could no
t verbalize. I thought maybe the 
streetcar would crash, or the taxi  would have 
an accident . There was no coherent explanation 

of why this terrible fear.  
Q:  Did it affect your eating? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
11 
 
 
A:  Yes, I was a very poor eater, and the sc
hool doctor recomme nded that I go for summe r  
vacation to a children™s ho me  so I could recupe rate
 a little bit, and my father had to convince 
them that we went on vacation every year, 
and it was, you know, there was no shortage of 
food, and they didn™t have to worry. And I ne
ver did go. I would not go away from home 
alone.  
Q:  Do you think your personality changed as you were by yourself a little bit more and you™re 
painting?  
A:  No, I don™t think at that point
, not at that point, probably la
ter, but not at that point. The 
change that I reme mber took place in 1938. 
Q:  When your father is- 
A:  No. 

Q:  Was taken? 

A:  Yes, when my father was taken to Poland, a
nd then, of course, when I walked to school on 
Nove mber 10
th
, after the Night of the 
Broken Glass, and I saw the synagogues burning. I saw 
the stores vandalized, and we turned around a
nd went back home . That™s when it really 
became clear to me that this was not a place to 
stay or to live, but since I had no influe nce, 
there was nothing I could do. 
Q:  And, you™re over 13 then, 13 a
nd a half or some thing right? 
A:  Yes, right. I could have g
one on a children™s boat to Engl
and, but I would not go alone, not 
without - 
Q:  Not without your sister? 

A:  No. 

Q:  No, just alone, and you wouldn™t do it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
12 
 
 
A:  No.  
Q:  Tell me  about your nightmares. 

A:  Then or now? 

Q:  Then. Now we™ll do later. 

A:  My nightma res then were of accidents, of ve
hicles crashi ng, of streetcars de railing, of trains 
catching fire, because they had old-fashioned lo
comotives, of catastrophes. I was worried in a 
thunderstorm. I was petrified of lighten
ing and these were the nightma res. 
Q:  And you™re in these situations all the time? 

A:  Right, right, I was there. 

Q:  Do you survive them or you don™t survive them in the dreams ?  Do you reme mber? 

A:  I know that I talked in my dreams and I know
 that I screamed in my dreams, and I know I 
woke. 
Q:  Now, before  your father 
is sent to Poland, in 1937, you l
eave the place where you™ve been 
living all your life. Am I correct? 
A:  In 1937, my father voluntarily closed the business. I assume d the reasons to be because we 
were Jewish, but it really wasn
™t the ma in reason. The ma in reason was that he didn™t need 
the business. There was enough money. There wa
s enough income . There was sufficient real 
estate. So, why bother?   
Q:  So, he was getting sufficient income  from the real estate. 

A:  Right. 

Q:  I see. 

A:  And he just voluntarily
 liquated in ™37, and his brother in Pa
lestine, who left  fr om Berlin in 
™34, asked that we come , and they said, ﬁNo, 
we are not comi ng.ﬂ And 
the letter that my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
13 
 
 
father wrote to my uncle, which was lost but I 
know of the letter, was if he can eat doves in 
this country, why should we come  with a Buns
en burner to Palestine?  So, that was never a 
consideration of leaving the country. 
Q:  Although you had it in your head? 
A:  Yes, because my class mates left, and it was 
an adventure. I did not know what it me ant to go 
to Palestine, or to the USA. It was a cha
nge. It was an adventure. Everybody was doing it. 
Why shouldn™t I do it? 
Q:  Did you say this to yo
ur parents? Did you say- 
A:  I said, ﬁWhy can™t we leave?  Everybody else
 is leaving.ﬂ And they
 said, ﬁDon™t worry, don™t 
worry. It™ll be Œ it™ll be okay.ﬂ  
Q:  So, in ™37, you don™t leave the apartment, you stay there. 

A:  Towards the end of ™37, we lived in a condom
inium, and the whole comp lex Œ and the street 
is still standing Œ made it clear that  the six 
or se ven Jewish fa milies who occupied I would 
say a total of probably a hundred condominiums, 
they were no longer desired, and would we 
please sell our interest and m
ove. And we move d to another apartment that was owned by a 
Jewish attorney in a not-so-nice area, but 
acceptable area, and all I reme mber of that 
apartment is that it had a tiny little ort
hodox synagogue in the backyard. We never went 
there, but there was one, probably a hundred 
me mbers at the most. The other thing I 
reme mber is that on November 10
th
 or 11
th
, we had a knock on the door at four in the 
morning, and there was my mothe
r™s brother and his son and his 
wife, and they had spent the 
night in a train from Cottbus to come  to Ham
burg to escape the arrest 
of all ma les which took 
place on the 10
th
 of November. So, they were hiding out
 in that apartmen
t for a couple of 
weeks.

Q:  But that™s after your father™s gone. 
A:  My father was already in Poland. 

Q:  Now, let me  ask you some thing that I forgot
 to ask you about. Wa s yours a religious home  in 
any way? 
A:  Yes. It was religious because both my fa
milies came from an orthodox home. All the laws 
were observed. There we re some  rabbis in the 
family on my mother™s side. My grandmother 
wore a wig, and I found that very amusing becau
se she would lift it like you lift a cover on a 
pot of potatoes, and then she™
d put it back. And Œ but when 
my parents came  to Ger many, 
they somewhat Œ they became some what more lib
eral. The congregation they belonged to we 
would call today ﬁconservativeﬂ rather than 
ﬁorthodoxﬂ. The home  had separate dishes. 
Kashrut
 was observed, but I would say looking back
 probably not a hundred percent, only 80 
percent, but as far as school
 was concerned, it wa s very orth
odox. So, they tried not to upset 
me  with giving me  two sets of
 values Œ the more liberal 
value at home and the orthodox 
value at school, but yes, it was a religious household. 
Q:  And that was comfortable for you? 

A:  I never questioned 
it. It was customary. 
Q:  And were most of your
 friends orthodox, as well? 
A:  Yes.  

Q:  Okay, let™s go back up to ™37-™38. How is it 
that your father is take
n?  Does he receive a 
notice? Does some one c o me  to the door and 
say, ﬁYou™re a Polish natio
nalﬂ?  And why aren™t 
you all sent out, why only your father? 
A:  The Polish Consul in Hamburg was supp
lied Œ wa s supposed to supply a stamp or a 
validation on all Polish passports, those of 
Jews and non-Jews, except there happened to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
15 
 
 
no non-Jews. But, for some  reason, he refused. Wh
ether the reasons were anti-Semitic or not, 
he refused, and I only know of one or two 
cases where bribery worked, which was very 
unusual. The mo ment he refused to validate 
the passports, the Germ
ans s a id, ﬁYou™re no 
longer a valid foreign national living on Germ
an ground.ﬂ At five-of-one in the morning, 
they rounded up Œ they came to our door. They 
rang the bell, and it wa
s local police. And 
they said, ﬁYou have to come  with me  because
 of the ma tter of the stamps, and we take you 
to a schoolyard downtown.ﬂ And 
my father said, ﬁMy wife just had surgery three mo nths 
ago. Can she stay with the children?ﬂ And my si
ster and I stood in the hallway and listened, 
and since he was a local policeman, he said, 
ﬁAll right. You come  with me, and I let the 
fa mily stay.ﬂ By afternoon, we heard by phone 
that this was done th
roughout the city, and 
they had rounded up several thousand people, or
 ma ybe in Ha mburg alone it was not quite as 
much, and that they were held in a schoolya
rd, and some body suggested
 that we bring my 
father a suitcase with some clothing. But they al
so said for my mother not to go because they 
would keep her. She packed a suitcase and I 
insisted to take it down. It was heavy. I took 
public transportation. I took 
the subway Œ the underground and the above-ground, and I 
dragged that suitcase all the wa
y down to the schoolyard. The 
gate was open and I started 
looking for my father, but there were a gr
eat ma ny people Œ me n, wome n and children, and 
he found me . I gave him the suitcase, and I re
me mber distinctly saying to him, ﬁCome home 
with me . The gate is open. There is no guard. 
There are no people. Just come  home and we™ll 
hide, or some thing.ﬂ And my father looked 
at me  and he said, ﬁThat wouldn™t be the 
honorable thing to do.ﬂ I did not
 understand what he meant, but my father played by the 
rules. When the law was published that you were 
not allowed to have foreign currency or to 
have currency in a foreign country, my fa
ther took the mone y th
at was in Holland and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
16 
 
 
brought it back to Germany. So, you played by 
the rules, which I learned ma ny years later 
that you don™t have to. He could have just wa
lked out. Nobody would have
 said a thing, and 
some  people did, but very few. He was pushed 
over the border. The Poles pushed back, and 
the Germans pushed him in. They got to Zbaszyn, from Zbaszyn he went to Posen. He stayed 

there two months. He tried to come  back to 
Germany. He couldn™t get 
an entry visa, and he 
went to Sambor, to mother™s family, and 
he stayed there until May 1940, no 1939, excuse 
me , when he got permission to come  back fo
r four weeks. In the meanti me, my mother 

decided to liquidate the household and to ship
 all that was contained in an eight-room 

apartment in huge containers to 
Palestine, to my father™s br
other. She handled the shipping. 
She handled the packing. She handled the Gest
apo who ca me  to watch, and tried to approve 
every single item that went out 
of the country. She put a bottle 
of wine and two glasses on the 
table, and she refilled it with
 two or three more bottles, and 
they drank a great deal and we 
packed fast. 
Q:  Who drank? 

A:  The two Gestapo. 

Q:  The two Gestapo, not your mother? 

A:  No, no, no. She just talked to the packers, ﬁH
urry up, pack.ﬂ We did not
 take anything of any 
particular value, just the furniture, clothing, 
linens and silverware, jewelry Œ whatever we 
norma lly had in the apartment, but the faster 
the better. The two crates we re packed. They 
were picked-up, and they were shipped to Triest
e. We, in the meanti me, had to give up under 
new Ger man laws the apartment and we were a
ssigned to a room on We rd
er Street Five. In 
the meantime, my father was granted permi
ssion and he came back. I think the permission 
partly was through the inte
rventionof my mother w
ho hounded the Gestapo in the 
Staathaus
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
17 
 
 
in Hamburg. She wrote. She went in. She talked
 to them. They threatened with arrest. She 
didn™t give up. I never thought 
that a quiet, reserved woma n 
would do what she did, and it 
absolutely amazed me . When my father came  bac
k, we started to work on an affidavit for the 
United Stat es, and it certifi cate for Palestine. 
The four weeks ran out. My mother got an 
extension for another four weeks, and anothe
r four weeks, and one morning, on September 
1
st
, the doorbell rang at fi ve in the morning, six 
in the morning, and two me n appeared with 
hats and long, black leather coat
s, and it was September. It was warm. And they asked for my 
father, and they said that Germany is  at wa
r with Poland. We  have invaded Poland. You are 
an enemy alien, and you have to come  with us
. And that was the first day of the Second 

World Wa r. He was first sent to a prison in 
Fuhlsbüttel, which late
r became a concentration 
camp, and we were still allowed to bring every 
week a briefcase with 
laundry and take home  
a briefcase with dirty laundry fo
r about two or three weeks, but Poland lost the war for all 
intents and purposes within two weeks. They ha d pockets of resistance, but not of war, and 
the mo ment that became a fact, my father wa
s transported to Berlin to Oranienburg, to 
Sachsenhausen, and the ma il stopped comi ng. It wa
s sort of an aerogram with one sentence: 
ﬁI™m fine. I hope you are fine. Love, Ben.ﬂ These letters became  less and less frequent, until 

one arrived from Dachau. We  had never heard 
of the place. My mother ma de, I would say, 
twice monthly trips to the 
Gestapo in Ha mburg, in the 
Stathaus
, pleading for release, trying 
to work for an exit visa, trying to work towa
rds immigration papers, a
nyplace, writing a letter 
every week to the head of the Gestapo. The end result was that they br ought my father to 

Gestapo headquarters for an hour™s visit. He 
had on a grey and blue striped prison uniform 
and ma tching cap. We  were sitting on opposite si
des of the table, no touching. We  talked but 

nobody could talk. My mother assured him sh
e would try. It was a Catch-22. To go to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
18 
 
 
Shanghai, you had to have 400 Ame r ican dollars
, but you weren™t allowed to have American 
currenc ies, and we had nobody who would give it
 to us. Our accounts had been blocke d. Our 
money had been confiscated. We  got a hundred dollars a month allowance to live on, no 
more. We  had to move to the apartment next 
door, number seven. I still went to school. My 
sister still went to school. We  went to the 
Jewish Community Council, who was headed at 
that time by a Doctor Plaut (ph). Doctor Plaut at
 that time  was  a ma n in his early 50s. He  was 
unma rried. You had to wait for an audience,
 like you wait for the pope. We pleaded for 
papers because it was an emergency because 
some body was sitting in a concentration camp, 
and he shrugged his shoulders and he said th
ere wa s nothing he could do, but he became  very 
well known for the fact that you could buy 
favors, but that was 1939, 1940. We  heard 
rumors. He married a very much younger woma
n with two young children, and he rema ined, 

as I™m told, in Germany and was exchanged for a German I believe in Yugoslavia, pretty 

much into the war ™43-™44. He ended up in Palestine. My father rema ined in Dachau and one 
ma n was released, and he had papers, first for 
Italy and then for Pale
stine, and my mother 
and I went to see him one evening after curfew
, and we saw this six foot tall ma n who was a 
skeleton Œ no front teeth, shaven head Œ and 
when my mother asked him, ﬁHow is Benno? ﬂ 
He said, ﬁFine.ﬂ He ma naged to leave Germ
any with his wife and two children, and he 
promised to help once he would be outside. Goin
g back to ™39, when my 
father returned from 
Poland, he talked to the Italian Consul and th
ey were on friendly terms, and he offered my 
father a three-day visa to Italy, and my father
 said, ﬁAnd what do I do 
after the three days?ﬂ 
And being Italian the ma n said, ﬁGo, and wo
rry later.ﬂ My father wouldn™t go. He was 
murdered in Dachau in February 1941. The Gest
apo did some thing that 
the very rarely did. 
They brought us a cigar boxes with ashes. Whose  ashes?  We  will never know.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
19 
 
 
Q:  Who was at the door when they - ? 
A:  I opened the door. 

Q:  You opened the door. 

A:  And, they said, ﬁMrs. Landau?ﬂ And I took th
em to the kitchen, and they threw the box on 
the tabl e, and they said, ﬁAshes, Benjam
in Landau.ﬂ And my mother screamed, and 
some thing on the stove was burning, and they left, and that was February ™41. I went to 

school in the daytime. I did homewor k, sewi
ng at night because we needed the money 
desperately, and we had to move to another furnished room. 
Q:  Let me  ask you some thing. When these me n come  in and they throw this cigar box on the 
table and your mother screams, what do you do? 
A:  Nothing. I stood frozen. 

Q:  You just stood there. 

A:  I just Œ I couldn™t compr ehe
nd. First of all, I didn™t know wh
at cremation was. I had never 
been to a cemetery. I didn™t know what ashes mean
t at this point. It was a concept that was 
not within the Jewish reli
gion. So, it took mi nutes or Œ 
I don™t know how long it took to 
really comprehend what it was. Some body called 
the chief rabbi, which was Josef Carlebach, 
and it was an orthodox burial although it was not
 in accordance with law. And we never 
found out whether those are really
 his ashes. The body Œ the ashes 
were buried in the Jewish 
cemetery in Ha mburg, and we ma naged to save
 some  money and give it to a non-Jewish 
business acquaintance to set a stone, and the ston
e still st ands. We lived in this apartment 
until Fall ™41, when we received notification for resettlement, and all it said was ﬁEastﬂ 

nothing else.

Q:  Okay, I want to come  back a little bit.
 I™m assumi ng that the luggage, when you went down 
the first time, when your father was take
n in ™38, was a fairly piece of luggage. 
A:  It was actually a big suitcase. 
Q:  You, who talk about being so frightened th
rough this period, all of a 
sudden, you™re going to 
take this luggage because you know it™s too dang
erous for your mother. Were you frightened 
when you went? 
A:  I didn™t think. I knew I had to deliver it, one 
way or another, and I ju
st Œ I couldn™t carry it, 
either. I dragged it, and luggage didn™t have
 wheels in those days. No, I wasn™t Œ I wa s 
probably apprehensive , but not fright ened. I knew
 I had to take it someplace, and that was all 
that mattered. 
Q:  And when you saw your fa
ther, did you hug each other? 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  You did? 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  Were you annoyed with him, angered with him?  

A:  No, I cried. 

Q:  Frustrated with him that he Œ you cried. 

A:  I cried.  

Q:  And he cried? 

A:  No. 

Q:  No?  And when he wouldn™t come  with you? 

A:  Well, he pushed me  towa rds the gate. He
 turned me around and said, ﬁPlease go.ﬂ And I 
went. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
21 
 
 
Q:  And did you cry all the way home? 
A:  I tried not to. 

Q:  Did you walk or did you take the subway? 

A:  It was too much to walk. I took the subway again. 

Q:  You said you were surprised at how your mother behaved. That she seemed to change from 
the woma n you had known, so that once her husband was gone, she took over as the head of 

the household. 
A:  Right, right. 

Q:  And fairly easily I gather from what you- 

A:  Well, she felt driven. She felt if she didn™t 
do it, who would do it?  And she believed truly that 
she could get my father released.  
Q:  Now, when you came home  that day, did you wa
nt to fall into your mother™s arms crying, or 
did you go to your room?  Do you have any recollection? 
A:  I think that night we Œ my
 sister and I Œ slept in the bi
g bed in my parents™ bedroom. 
Q:  With your mother? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  Did your mo ther cry? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  So, that must have been very hard on both of you. 

A:  Very hard. 

Q:  Did you know what to do?  I mean, there™s nothing. 

A:  There was nothing. There was nothing to say or nothing to do. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
22 
 
 
Q:  Did friends come  over?  Ot
her wome n who had also lost their husbands, or who hadn™t but 
were friends with your mother? 
A:  No, because everybody stayed at home  by the phone hoping. So, nobody came over, but the 
phone lines went back and forth, ﬁHave you 
heard? ﬂ ﬁWhat do you know?ﬂ ﬁWill we get the 
stamp in the passport?ﬂ ﬁWill they let them 
come back next week?ﬂ It was conjecture, 
nobody really knew.  
Q:  Right. Now, during this peri
od, before your father returns for that month and then another 
four weeks and another four weeks, the money 
that you have as far as you know is the same  
amount that you have had before. They 
haven™t confiscated the money ye t. 
A:  No, they didn™t get around to th
at yet. That only happened after the 1
st
 of September when 
Poland was invaded. Until that time , we had fr
ee access to bank accounts, to anythi ng within 

Germany. 
Q:  Right, and your mother didn™t move money some  place. 
A:  No, it was unthinkable. 
Q:  Unthinkable to do? 

A:  It was unthinkable. I know sufficient peopl
e moved it to Switzerland or to Holland or Œ no, it 
just was illegal, and you 
didn™t do things
 illegal. 
Q:  Right, and you™re smiling. When your father 
is taken the se cond time, does this feel more 
ominous to you?  You™re older now of course and you do- 
A:  No, it did not, because he  was treated for 
the first two weeks under the Ge neva Conventions 
as an enemy alien, and believing, or having le
arned about the Geneva
 Conventions, I me an, 
after all it couldn™t be bad. You could bring 
laundry once a week, and pick up laundry once a 
week, and do the same  over again. And I don™t th
ink we even contemplated the end of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
23 
 
 
war or Poland losing the war. I think we na
ively anticipated a settlement, international 
intervention, or some thing of that sort. 
Q:  So, when did you start to worry?  When he™s taken out to Oranienburg? 
A:  Yes. Once they shipped him to Sachsenhaus
en, Oranienburg, and Dachau, then we began to 
realize that there is a concentration camp. 
Q:  Did you expect him to return in
 your head or were you pessimi stic? 

A:  My mother did. I did not. 

Q:  And how do you know she did?  She said it? 

A:  She talked about it.  

Q:  And you never said to her–? 

A:  No, because there were other me n taken at th
e same ti me, I either knew their sons or  their 
daughters, and several of them perished or we
re murdered, and I did 
not believe that there 
was escaping Dachau. 
Q:  And now the money is–? 

A:  Blocked. 

Q:  Blocked. And you get a hundred dollars a month from where? 

A:  Out of our account admi nistered by the Deutsche Bank. 

Q:  I see.  

A:  And by the Gestapo, under 
supervision of the Gestapo. 
Q:  So, life is getting narrowe r a
nd tighter and harder for everyone. 
A:  Very hard. 

Q:  We should take a break 
now, the tape is running out. 
End of Tape 1 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417

Tape 2 
Q:  Once your father is taken away and ends up 
in Dachau, and your mother is now again the 
head of the household, because I imagine when 
he returned even for those 12 weeks, he 
became head of the household again?  
A:  Right. 
Q:  So, then it come s back to her. 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  And her spirits keep up because sh
e™s fighting to try to get him back. 
A:  Yes, because our neighbor next door had a 
typewr iter, Mr. Berman, and he would write the 
weekly letters to the Gest apo to release my father. 
Q:  And she would dictate them?  

A:  Well, she would tell him what to write, and 
she would sign them and either deliver them or 
mail them week after week. 
Q:  Now, you™re old enough to notice some  cha
nges. When your father come s back, does she 
change?  Does her personality seem to change? 
A:  A little bit. Not entirely to what it was 
before. She was very reassuring that the certificate 
from Palestine would come . She was very s
upportive. But any initiation, any discussion, any 
plans were ma de by my 
father, and she agreed. 
Q:  She agreed? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  So, he didn™t change very much. 

A:  No. 

Q:  That you noticed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
25 
 
 
A:  No. 
Q:  When you saw him whe n he had been taken 
the second time, you saw him in the prison, and 
then you saw hi m later, did he change significantly? 
A:  He lost a lot of weight. 
He was always slim, but not gaunt
, and he was gray. His skin was 
gray and gaunt.  
Q:  Did that frighten you? 

A:  Yes.  

Q:  So, it must have been tough when you folks left him and you go back with the me mor y of 
what he was looking like and where it was. 
A:  Yes, but we still believed ther
e was a chance to get him released. 
Q:  Would little Karin go with you, too?  

A:  Yes. 

Q:  She was by then eight, nine Œ nine years old. 
A:  Uh-huh. 
Q:  Right, so you would all go together? 

A:  Yes. Yes. The building where we saw him 
still st ands. And when I come to the corner, I 
cross the street. I 
just don™t want to walk past it. 
Q:  What was the funeral like? 

A:  The funeral was small because there were
 few people left. It 
was like all the orthodox 
funerals. It was a plain, pine co
ffin. The rabbi cut the lapels of
 the coat, and I really don™t 
reme mber much. It was an open grav
e. There was a seven-day shiva.  
Q:  There was?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
26 
 
 
A:  Oh, yes. There was really nothing to sa y because
 there were so few Jews
 left or so few Jews 
willing to come out to the cemetery. There was 
a mi nion. The r e were some  visitors to the 
house during the week. It didn™t 
seem real. It seemed like you ha
d seen a film, but it really 
didn™t happen.  
Q:  Did you notice a change in your mother? 

A:  Yes, she was very withdrawn, very quiet, very disinterested in the daily routine. We  had to 
shop in special stores, food stores. The food c
oupons had a ﬁJﬂ on them. The rations were, of 
course, smaller. And she, in a way, sent me  out to do the errands.  
Q:  So, did you then have to take 
more responsibility in the family? 
A:  Yes, I did. 

Q:  Did you understand that? 

A:  Yes, I understood it to the extent that I went
 to the largest departme
nt store who, before the 
9
th
 of November was Jewish but no longer, and 
I said I could sew. Could they give me  
dresses to sew at night?  And th
ey said, ﬁYes.ﬂ And they gave
 me the design Œ a plain shirt 
top with a pleated skirt. And 
I was sewing at night after school. I was sewing on Saturdays, 

and my mother didn™t say a word that you don™t sew on Saturdays. And I got paid once a 

week in a little brown envelope, and after six 
weeks the lady in charge said, ﬁThe skirts are 
crooked and the sleeves are backwards and the co
llar doesn™t close. I™m s orry. We  can™t use 
you.ﬂ I mean, I was Œ I had taken a course in
 school, but I wa s not a seamstress. I was 16 
years old. 
Q:  But, you certainly were trying, weren™t you? 

A:  I was trying. 

Q:  Were you disappointed? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
27 
 
 
A:  Yes, I was heartbroken. I was later on told 
by a lady that I should ha
ve tried in the infants 
departme nt. It would have been so much easier,
 but that of course had never dawned on me , 
and by then you couldn™t ge
t jobs for anything. 
Q:  And how wa s Karin during this period?  Did sh
e understand that your father is gone forever? 
A:  She understood, but on a different level. Shealso came with Scarlet 
Fever during that time, 
and she had to be put into a public hospital be
hind a fence. We could talk to her through the 
fence, but it was highly contag
ious. In those days, there wa
s no me dication. And after six 
weeks she came  back home . She understood that
 he was gone, but she didn™t understand for 
how long, or why, or how permanent 
it would be. That came later.  
Q:  And did she ask you where he was? 

A:  No, she didn™t ask because
 she was at the funeral. 
Q:  So, she knew in some  ways? 

A:  She knew on some  level that there wa s a grave and there was some thing in the grave. She did 
not understand about the ashes. Why would a human
 being become  ashes?  That did not ma ke 
sense at all, and I couldn™t 
explain it. I just couldn™t. 
Q:  This is a strange question I 
just thought of, but I™m going to 
ask it anyway Œ did they put the 
cigar box into the coffin? 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  Just as it was? 

A:  That™s Hallakik (ph) Law, yes. I me an, 
cremation is not Jewish. You don™t do it. And they 
did not know how to handle it because I don™t think the rabbi, who was probably in his 60s, 

had ever had any experience. He was a very 
learned ma n, and he ma de the decision and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
28 
 
 
said he would defend it and _______ if necessary, a
nd the box, the way we received it with a 
rubber band, was put into the coffin. 
Q:  So, that was- 
A:  That was February 1941. 

Q:  So, you go from February ™41 until October 21
st
 when you get the notification. So, you™re not 
working. 
A:  No. 

Q:  Your mother™s not working. 

A:  But I™m going to school. 

Q:  But you™re going to school the whole time. 

A:  Uh-huh. 

Q:  And your mother gets more 
and more reserved and withdrawn. 
A:  Withdrawn, quiet, resigned pr
obably is the proper word for it. 
She still talked to people. We 
still occasionally saw an old family friend, 
but there was no Œ no joy. There was no laughter. 

There was no Œ there was no plan for any kind of a future. 
Q:  So, when you would eat together whatev
er the very small amounts of food you had, 
conversation? 
A:  No. 

Q:  It was always quiet. 

A:  Quiet. 

Q:  And did you play with friends still? 

A:  Yes, I still had friends. There was stilla youth organization. There was still a so-called 
ﬁHouse of Cultureﬂ for Jews, and there were f
ilms; some time s there were ping- pong game s. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
29 
 
 
I belonged to Bar Kochba. There were even danc
e classes. And I went dancing with the son 
of Rabbi Callabah (sp) who wa
s a Hassidic Jew in New York.  
Q:  Right.  
A:  But he used to dance, when we were 13. 

Q:  So, do you recall any mo me nts of ple a sure dur
ing that period. I me an, were these ki nds of 
things in some sense a relief? 
A:  No, they were a relief, and there were mo
ments when you just lived
 that mome nt. You did 
not think about it, but when 
you went to them, you felt guilt
y, and yet the following week, 
you went back again. You probably Œ I probably kne
w that this was not th
e thing to do, but I 
did it. There were light mome
nts. They were cheering when Bar Kochba won the ping-pong 
game . I re member my ol d fashioned record pl
ayer the Andrew Sisters. I reme mber some  
American jazz, which was not permitted, but fo
r five dollars you could ha ve a copy ma de on 

a wax platter. So, we learned to dance swing, 
which was the latest rage. There were even 
fashion trends. The boys would wear trench co
ats and those sloppy hats with the wide brim. 
The girls would wear pleated skir
ts and thick rubber soles, white or beige rubber soles. That 
was the style. Stockings were no longer av
ailable so you painted your legs and you put a 
black line on the back. Silk stockings were uno
btainable. And if you had a pair, you had them 
forever repaired. Clothing coupons
 Jews did not get. If there 
was clothing available in the 
store, we couldn™t buy it. The 
children or the young people di
d not mi nd. It wasn™t that 
important. What was important wa
s to be with other young people. 
Q:  Did your mo ther not want you to
 go, or she didn™t say anything? 

A:  She didn™t say anything, but
 they Œ I had the impression that she felt that it showed 
disrespect. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
30 
 
 
Q:  That it would show disrespect to go? 
A:  To the year of 
mourning for my father. 
Q:  I see, but you obviously were not
 going to respond to that some how. 
A:  She did not say so. She did re
quest that we observe the first 
30 days, and after that she did 
not say anything. 
Q:  And, when you were with young people, I im
agine you talked about what was going on in 
some way, or am I wrong? 
A:  We talked about those people that had good ch
ances of leaving Œ how, when, where, by what 
means. Do you take a boat to Shanghai or do 
you take the overland railroad?  We  talked about 
Palestine. We talked about the small groups 
that were smuggled into Yugoslavia and that 
made it as far as the Mediterrane
an and then swam into Haifa, and they were put in Turkey 
prison. We  knew of course that England was he
avily involved in the war. We  were being 
bombed during that time. We  had to go into ai
r raid shelters, and Jews had to be in one 
corner. Not that there were ma ny. But I think we 
were fairly aware of 
the fact that England 
couldn™t possibly win the war. 
It was too small a country, t
oo far away, and there was no 
more Czechoslovakia. There was no more Aust
ria. There was no more Poland. Holland was 
overrun. We  did not see any hope. There was ta
lk of Madagascar, of settling us in 
Madagascar, and then it tu
rned out it was a joke.   
Q:  And how did you hear about Ma
dagascar? From the other kids? 
A:  Yes. I reme mber my mother going to Ber
lin when Molotov was in Berlin and signed the 
agreement with Hitler. The reason for my mother
 going was that the city
 of Sombor became  
Russia. It wa s the first town on the Russian 
border. And she thought that by going to Berlin 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
31 
 
 
ma ybe she could get a temporary passport, or ma
ybe there would be a possibility to go there 
Œ all sorts of unreal scheme s, but you tried 
anything. And I reme mber the visit to Berlin. 
Q:  You went with her or no? 
A:  I went along and we had to stay with a 
girlfriend of an old acquaintance of the fa mily 
because you couldn™t stay in a hotel. 
Q:  Was that an expensive trip? 

A:  No, you we nt by rail. It took four hours. We  
went third class because a) we didn™t have the 
money, and b) you™re less conspicuous. I reme mb
er when we used to travel to Poland, we 
traveled first class and the 
upholstery was red plush and it itc
hed when you sat on it, and at 
night the porter would ma ke our beds. S
o, the Berlin trip was quite different. 
Q:  Do you still have a radio in your house? 

A:  There was a radio in the apartment and a te
lephone, and I think the 
radio and the telephone 
belonged to Mr. Berman because he had privile
ge s by reason of an intermarriage, and two 
sons Œ I think they even were on the 
Wehrmacht
, if I™m not mistaken, la
ter in the war, and so 
he had the privilege of radio, 
but it was not a short wave. It 
was just local stations. And I 
think he had a telephone. 
Q:  Did you ever hear Hitler speaking on the radio? 
A:  Yes, ma ny time s. 

Q:  Many times. 

A:  I even saw hi m once. 

Q:  Where did you see him?  

A:  We went downtown, and that was in the mi d ™
30s, into the district wh
ere all the departme nt 
stores were like a small Fifth Avenue. And 
all of a sudden, the SS and the SR were pushing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
32 
 
 
the people from the sidewalk f
acing the street on both sides, 
and a motorcade appeared, open, 
and Hitler was standi ng with his right arm ra
ised, looking right, looking left, and everybody 
raised their right arm. And I st
ood in fr ont of my mother Œshe 
was a little bit taller than I Œ 
and she put her right arm on my he ad instead of
 raising it over me . She put it on my head. 
We  were afraid. 
Q:  And what did you do? 
A:  I just sort of squeezed 
in between the other young people. 
I just, nothing. I was petrified. I 
heard him speak many times, or rave, it was not 
speaking, but that™s the only time I saw hi m.  
Q:  And what did you think or feel when
 you Œ I gather you heard him on the radio? 
A:  Yeah, right. 

Q:  Did he ma ke  you nervous?  Did you think he
 was just crazy and this couldn™t last? 

A:  I ŒI just couldn™t understand this ranting 
and raving because even to a young person, it ma de 
so little sense. And then when he talked about 
race and Jews and the in
ternational conspiracy, 
and Jews own all the mo ney and all the ba
nks. I once asked in school, and the ma n who 
taught history was Professor Eunice,
 and I said, ﬁWhat is the per
centage of the Jews living in 
Germany? ﬂ And it was less than one percent or 
some thing, and I said, ﬁBut we can™t own all 
that they say that we do 
own.ﬂ It didn™t ma ke sense. I could not comprehend. 
Q:  Did you have non-Jewi
sh friends at all? 
A:  No. 

Q:  For childhood? 

A:  No. 

Q:  None. 

A:  I had neighbor kids, upstairs, downstairs, 
and we would play before
 ™33, but that was it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
33 
 
 
Q:  But that was it? 
A:  Yeah. 

Q:  So, you actually never had a conversation– 

A:  No. 

Q:  –after ™33– 

A:  No 

Q:  –with someone who wasn™t Jewish? 

A:  No, my mother occasiona
lly with a neighbor. My father 
occasionally over the phone with 
business associate of some  sort, but very cautio
usly, very carefully, and not really detailed.  
Q:  And when you would walk on the street, you 
would see police, soldie
rs Œ would people move 
away from you?  I mean, you didn™t have any - 
A:  If I went by myself, I could pass. If the 
SS walked by Œ ma inly the SR, the brown shirts, I 
could just sort of blend in, so to speak. If
 I was walking with some body else, I was out of 
luck. I mean, it was immediate. I don™t know how
 the Poles today can 
tell that I™m a Jew. 
When I go today to Poland, they say, ﬁOh, a 
Jew from America.ﬂ How they can tell I don™t 
know, but the Germans could, too. 
Q:  The Germans could? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  How would you hear about restrictions?  We re
 there curfews, places where you couldn™t go?  
Were their notices in Jewish newspapers? 
A:  There were notices on the movies, on the park
 benches. It was in newspapers, ﬁJews are no 
longer permitted on the st
reet after dark.ﬂ There was a newspaper called 
Der Stuermer
, which 
was the official organ of the Nazi party, with di
storted pictures of Jews. One of them had my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
34 
 
 
uncle in it, the one who had the big business in 
Cottbus. No, the restrictions were publicized 
ma inly in newspapers or, for instance, on st
ores. Early on, ﬁDon™t Buy Here. It™s a Jew.ﬂ 
Later on, when they were taken over by non-Je
ws, it was no longer an issue because the 
name s were changed. We went to a park in wi
nter and people would slide down the hill, and 
that was no longer permitted, ﬁJews No Entrance.ﬂ
 In summe r , in that park on every be nch, 
ﬁJews Forbidden.ﬂ I don™t think 
you could hire a taxi as a Jew.
 It was no longer possible. It 
was dangerous. 
Q:  And could you ride on th
e subway or the train? 
A:  We did during day hours, but towards the lastyear that we lived in 
Germany, we did not ride 
together. We would take the train, but ever
ybody would take a different compartment or a 
different train. Not that two or 
three people would sit next  to each
 other. I would take the first 
train. My mother would take the second trai
n, and we would know where we get out. We 
went out once after curfew, one tim
e only, and we almost got caught.  
Q:  Why did you ride separate trains? Were you al
ready conscious that you 
could just be picked 
up? 
A:  Yeah. And later on trains were no longer allo
wed for Jews, and Jews had to turn in cars, 
those who had cars. The Jews who were Germ
an nationals had to 
hand in their gold and 
silver  after the Kristall Night, to pay for the da
ma ges. It was strange going into a store where 
you had gone all your life to buy some  material 
for a dress, and all of a sudden you felt like 
everybody was looking at you. Or you were 
afraid they woul
d call the police. 
Q:  Because you weren™t allowed there or because–? 

A:  We were not supposed to be there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
35 
 
 
Q:  I see. At this period, did 
you begin to regret that you had 
not gone to England alone?  Did you 
think of that? 
A:  No. 
Q:  You didn™t think of that. 

A:  I regretted that we did not go when we coul
d have gone to Pa lestine 
in ™34. That I regretted. 
But going away alone, I never regretted. I would 
have never done it. And while all of the 
children Œ 10,000 of them Œ that
 did go from Aus t ria and Germany survived, except my 

girlfriend who was hit by a bomb in mi d-town
 London, they came out ve
ry bitter and very 
resentful elderly people. Ther
e™s now the organization of 
Kindertransport
 and they™re very 
angry. 
Q:  Why?  

A:  They feel there is compensation due them 
which they never received. They feel they were 
used as ma ids or taken out of school at age 14, a
nd sent to learn a trade 
rather than study at a 
university, and they feel that they suffered unj
ustly and they ne ver received an apology. They 
never receive d compens a tion. It™s a very vocal or
ganization, at least in 
California. And I can 
fully understand where they come  fr om and why th
ey feel this way, but it is now the year 
2001. They left in ™39. Most of them lost thei
r parents, not all, but
 a great ma ny. What are 
they trying to accomplish with the 
bitterness and with the publicity? 
Q:  So, are you glad that yo
u didn™t become  one of them?  
A:  No, the only reason I™m not one of them because
 I was just fearful of leaving. It ha d nothing 
to do with that. I was in Washington once for 
the meeting of Hidden Children, and they are 
very, very angry, and very bitt
er, and very Œ  I would say almost Œ for them, it™s almo st 
impossible to cope with these tw
o or three years in which they were hidden in France, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
36 
 
 
Belgium, Poland, wherever. So, there is a lot ofdama ge. It™s a ma tter of degree. I think we all 
sustained some , more or less, but
 it™s strange that 
it took 60 years to surface. There were no 
social workers. There was no psychiatric hel
p. There™s he lp given now, but what good will it 
do an 80 year old person
? Too little, too late. 
Q:  Your furniture was packed up and went
 to Trieste in order to go to Palest ine? 
A:  Yeah. 

Q:  And did it get there? 

A:  No. 

Q:  No. So, why didn™t it get there? 

A:  It got st uck in the harbor  in Trieste un
til 1945. In 1945, my uncle from Hai fa paid the st orage 
and had it shipped to Haifa. One of the crates 
Œ well, it was a container, it wasn™t a crate Œ 
was broken into, and it was the one container th
at contained my mother™s silver and jewelry. 
While they didn™t empt y it out, I don™t have one 
place setting. I™ll have one fork and I™ll have 
two spoons, but I won™t have any knives. My uncle
 received it into ™45 
or ™46 in Haifa. He 
asked me  what he should send me  Œ oriental rugs
 or silverware, whatever. I said, ﬁI want the 

pictur es that were in the crate. And if there™
s any jewelry of my moth
er™s, I would like it, and 
everything else please do whatever you think you
 want to do with it. I don™t wish to.ﬂ  
Q:  So, your understanding of what™s happening, on
ce your father dies when
 there™s this period 
of a number of months before you get th
e notice, do you expect to be deported? 
A:  No. There was no rumor. 

Q:  Nothing? 

A:  Nothing.  

Q:  So, when - 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
37 
 
 
A:  We assume d they would use 
us for workers in factories. 
Q:  In Germany ?  
A:  Yes. Especially the young me n.  

Q:  So, is your fear level gone down some ?  Are 
you getting used to it, or is it very high? 
A:  You get used to fear. You get used to looki
ng over your shoulder. You get used to limitations 
such as rationed food and living in a small r
oom. You adjust. You accept whatever is given 
you, but then there was a war, and there was a 
glimme r of hope that ma ybe Germany would 
lose the war, even in ™41.  
Q:  Okay. So, October 21
st
, 1941, you get a relocation notice. 
A:  Yes, we each had a suitcase. 

Q:  Well, what happened?  Y
ou got something in the mail? 
A:  Yes Œ no, it didn™t come in the mail.  

Q:  They delivered it? 
A:  Some  ca me  delivered and some  ca me registered. 
Q:  And who de livered it. Do you reme mber? 

A:  Gestapo. 

Q:  Gestapo delivered it?  And how did it come
 to you?  Some one delivered it to the door? 
A:  Yes, I believe some body delivered it. I don™
t know who took the noti
ce because there were 
about eight families living in that one apartment.  
Q:  I see. 

A:  And we read the notice, and everybody sa
id, ﬁThere™s nothing you can do. Pack what you 
can. Take three suitcases, and the rest just l
eave. We™ll give it away or whatever.ﬂ There 
wasn™t muc h. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
38 
 
 
Q:  Left anyway. Right. 
A:  No. No. And we reported. 

Q:  So, what did you take? 

A:  I took a coat. I took some clothing, but therewasn™t much. I took what little I had. And I had 
a little small briefcase, and I put 
some stationary into it, and so
me  addresses, and some letters 
I had received from friends in Palestine, and th
at I carried with me  and everything else was 
checked. And after two days or a day and a half, then it was called Lódz, and it still stands 

and I was inside in September, and I asked th
e director, ﬁDo you know wh
at this place was? ﬂ 
in 1941, and he knew. There were 1,100 of 
us Œ me n, wome n and children. The Jewish 
Community sent some  representatives to tell us 
that it would be okay and not to worry. There 
were some prominent leaders of the co mmunity on that particular list. It was the fi rst 

transport. We were put into cars, railroad 
cars, with wooden benche
s. And after two days, 
two and a half days, we arrived in a very
 sunny, dusty place Œ no railroad station, no 
personnel, nothing. 
Q:  Excuse me, what was the trip like? 

A:  The trip was quiet except for whi mpe ring 
children. There was more children on there or 
young people on that train. 
Q:  This wasn™t a cattle 
car with nothing in it. 
A:  No. 

Q:  This had benches? 

A:  Benches. 

Q:  On the sides of the cars? 

A:  No, the way Œ regular wooden benches Œ the 
way you have them now in an upholstered train. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
39 
 
 
Q:  And was there a toilet? 
A:  Not that I recall. 

Q:  Did you remember how one–? 

A:  I don™t know. I think they had buckets in 
the hallway, and each compartment had a sliding 
door. The windows were locked from the outside. 
So were the doors, and on the outside were 
German sol diers riding along the guns. 
Q:  And did you bring food as 
well?  Or did they feed you? 
A:  No, no. We  brought little ca
ndy, a few pieces of bread. It was a custom in Europe anyway, 
when you went on a train, you packed your own f
ood. You never went to the dining car. So, 
we did take some  food, and the lady next to
 us gave us some  candy. And that™s all I 
reme mber Œ I reme mber about the ride. Nobody r
eally spoke because the uncertainty and the 

bewilderme nt was still strong that 
you couldn™t put it into words.  
Q:  Did you meet some body name d Julie and Julius? 
A:  Yes, they sat next to us. 
Q:  On the train. This couple sat next to you. 

A:  Next to us on the train. 
We started to talk, and she as
ked me , ﬁDo you know the Rosenbergs 
in Hamburg? ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, Latti went to sc
hool with me . We were good
 friends.ﬂ She said, 
ﬁDid you know her ten year older brother, Howa
rd? ﬂ  I said, ﬁYes, I™ve met Howard once, but 
he didn™t talk to little girl
s ten years younger.ﬂ She said, ﬁO
h, my husband was a friend of 
Howard™s.ﬂ I said, ﬁThat™s nice.ﬂ  
Q:  And that was it? 

A:  That was it. 

Q:  Did you like her? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
40 
 
 
A:  Yes, she had red hair that was turning gray. She was chubby. She had a wonderful smile. She 
had teeth that had never been corrected that we
re spaced too fa r apart. It was said later on 
that she was called as a young girl ﬁRed Foxﬂ
 and she supposedly was a beauty. And her 
husband was small, bald, chubby, and a littl
e bit crumpy (ph) and quiet, but nice. 
Q:  And was she the age of your mother? 
A:  No, much older. 

Q:  Much older. 

A:  My mother was born in ™92. She mu st have be
en born at least six, seve
n years earlier. Maybe 
ten year s earlier. 
Q:  I™m going to suggest that we take a break 
now, and when we come  back we will begi n with 
the entrance into Lódz. Okay? 
A:  Okay, fine. 

Q:  Lucille, there™s one piece 
of the earlier stor y that we ne
glected. There ma y be ma ny pieces, 
but one piece that I know about that we neglect
ed. Na me ly the putting on of the Jewish star. 
And you do have a story of taki
ng it off and going some where. 
A:  Well, we were ordered to wear the star Œ le
ft-hand side, not on the b
ack, just in front, and it 
was 1941. I think it was September. And you we re
 very conspicuous, mo re so than ever, 
which was not a happy situation. And we had a ne
ighbor in the apartment in which we lived 
who was half Jewish. She had some  privileges 
that we did not have, but she was kind. She 
was quite elderly probably in he
r late ™60s, and very plain-looking, almost like a woman from 
the country, and she didn™t have
 to wear a star. And since I 
loved opera since I was about 10 
years old, she suggested one 
evening that we go to the 
Staats
 Opera in Hamburg, and I told 
her that  I could not with my star. I was not pe
rmitted. And she said, ﬁJust take it off. You go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
41 
 
 
with me , and we stand in the last ro
w, standing room only, and nobody will know the 
difference.ﬂ It didn™t ma ke a difference. We enjoyed the opera, but I really worried a great 
deal. 
Q:  And what was the opera? 

A:  It was a German opera. I think it could have been the 
Freischutz
 by Karl Maria Von We ber, 
but I wouldn™t swear to it. 
Q:  You™ve liked opera since you were 10? 

A:  Yes, my parents took my first to the easy 
ones Œ Magic Flute, La Bohe me  Œ the French and 
the Italians. And since I played
 music, it Œ I was not fond of 
a concert, but I loved opera. 
Q:  Really? 

A:  Yes, and I still do. 

Q:  So do I. Wh y didn™t you like concerts? 

A:  Because when I grew up, a lot of the concer
ts were composers that I was not too fond of, and 
I preferred chamber mus i c. It™s more intimate. 
You get more out of the mu sic. I like baroque 
music. I recently listened to Malas (ph) Sym
phony, and I enjoyed it, but it was Œ it was hard 
work to listen. 
Q:  It™s interesting because chamber mus i c is
 often a taste for some body who™s much older. 
A:  I grew up with it. I grew 
up with it. Both my kids play woodwinds, or used to play 
woodwinds, baroque flute, piccolo, clarinet. 
So, chamber mus i c was very much taken for 
granted. My husband loved chamber music. He loved Telema nn, and I never asked why or 

how come, it just was natural. 
Q:  And did you conti
nue to play violin? 

A:  No. I gave it up with
 the deportation to Poland. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
42 
 
 
Q:  Okay. 
A:  And I never touched another- 

Q:  Another instrume nt? 

A:  Another instrume nt, no. I would never go back to it. 

Q:  Why do you think? 

A:  Well, first of all, I had to give up the inst
rume nt itself, which was 
not a Stradivarius, but it 
was a good instrume nt. And some thing about the orch
estra Œ two of my frie
nds played in it in 
Auschwitz Œ ma de me  decide not to go back 
to it. I also would never buy a pair of boots. 
Boots became  very fas hionable a few years ago. I 
can™t buy a pair of boots, but that™s another 
story. 
Q:  We™ll come back to that. 

A:  All right. 

Q:  So, now we™re going to enter Lódz. 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  When you think of the first mo me nt that
 you got off the train, what did you see? 
A:  I saw the German soldiers lined up. The railro
ad cars were opened. We  
were ordered to come  
out. We  were ordered to line up in rows of fi
ve, a nd we saw a whole group of me n in black 
jackets, black trouser, a black hat with an oran
ge band, an orange arm band with the Star of 
David, and on their jackets were also yellow 
stars. The Germans hande d us over to these 
me n. The na me  given to them was ﬁghetto po
liceﬂ. The ground was sandy. It was dirty. It 
was not a railroad station. We  saw a wagon 
drawn by two horses and our suitcases were 
thrown on that wagon. The Germans went back
 into the trains, and the ghetto police 
explained to us Œ mostly in Polish, and hardly
 anybody spoke Polish Œ that we had to walk 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
43 
 
 
into the ghetto. My mother, who stood next to
 me , asked the first available policeman in 
Polish, ﬁWhere are we?  What is the ghetto?  What
™s going on? ﬂ  And on the hour and a half or 
two-hour walk, and it was very warm and there were ma ny elderly people, he explained to 
my mother that it was the city of Lódz, whic
h was fa miliar to her. It was the ghetto, which 
was an area that was totally enclosed. And as 
we kept on walking, we saw people that didn™t 
look at us. They looked ragged. They looked ti red. They looked ill-f
ed and ill-dressed. And 
we saw buildings that were dila
pidated. Some  were Œ some  stre
ets were paved; others were 
not. We  saw no vehicles. We  saw no automobiles. 
We  saw no trucks. But 
he explained to my 
mother, and she translated, that the ghetto wa
s an area that was fenc
ed in and guarded by 
Germans. There was no into the ghetto; there 
was no out of the ghetto. And my mother ma de 
a very flippant rema rk, ﬁWell, if you want to 
get out of this situat
ion, you always can.ﬂ And 
he said, ﬁHardly.ﬂ They walked us to a sc
hool on Mlynarska Street. This school evidently 
had been abandoned, and they housed all 1,100 of 
us on two, possibly three, stories in what 
used to be classrooms, lecture rooms. We even
tually got our suitcases. We  put our coats or 

whoever had a blanket on the floor, and that™s ho
w we lived for six weeks. The Jewish ghetto 
admi nistration sent in a kitchen 
detail once a day to bring soup. 
This soup was ma inly water, 
very little else. In the mornings, we received 
someti mes a slice of bread and a liqui d that was 
bitter tasting and supposed to look like coffee, 
but it had a grainy substance. It had no coffee. 
And at that point, most of us still had some
 money, which we had brought from Germany. 
Some  of it sewn into shoulder pads, into belt
s, into shoes. And those of us who had some  
money Œ some  more, others less Œ you could 
go into the courtyard 
and the people who had 
lived in the ghetto since 1940 when it was first 
closed would sell out of
 newspaper a little 
piece of bread, a chunk of ma rgarine, anything ed
ible, and we would buy it with this German 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
44 
 
 
money, not realizing that the currency in th
e ghetto was not German mone y. It was special 
ghetto-printed money similar to Monopoly mo
ney, and that we were by far overpaying. 
When we ran out of the money, we would sell so me  of our so-called ﬁwesternﬂ belongings Œ 
a silk blouse, a silk scarf, an alligator pur
se Œ whatever any family had brought along and it 
was deemed no longer necessary, superfluous, and it brought in some  food. These things 

were not sold for money. They were bartered
 for food. I reme mber seeing my mother in the 
courtyard bartering for bread and ma rgarine against a silk blouse. 
Q:  How big of a Œ lik
e a small pi ece of bread? 
A:  Oh, I would say ma ybe 200 grams Œ a small 
piece of bread. The ghetto bread was about Œ it 
was a round loaf of bread. It had to
 last at that point a week, a
nd we cut it into seven or eight 
wedges once we got our permanent food rations. And I took my mother™s example, and I had 

a purse. And when she did not realize it, I did 
the same thing. I traded
 the purse for some  
bread. It was traded to a young 
woman a little older than I 
was, who came with a very good-
looking gentlema n probably ten years older who ha
d a briefcase, and he wanted to give me  
one piece of bread and I said, ﬁIt™s too little.ﬂ 
And they laughed. They didn™t speak German 

and I didn™t speak Polish, but we ma naged. A
nd I stood there for two hours and eventually 
they came back and I got two pieces of bread. 
But even that had limitation because you ran 
out of tradable goods. Nobody had jewelry. That ha
d to be left for the Germans. And what 
was left was really the bare essentials, not more
 than that. After six weeks, we were assigned 
to various rooms. 
Q:  Stop for a minute. What happens to washi
ng and sanitary conditions? There™s no bathrooms 
in the pl ace. There™s no showers, bathtubs, nothi ng. So, what happens to you physically? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417

A:  There was a pump in the courtyard, a
nd if you knew some body with either a bowl or a 
bucket, you would borrow it. In the beginning, we
 had some  soap, but you use up soap and 
then you ma ke do without soap. This school had outhouses in the backyard. The outhouses 
were used by 1,100 people. They were filthy. They were unsanitary. People got sick. There 

were accidents. You washed and we used to ca
ll it a cat™s wash because you really couldn™t 
wash. There was no privacy. There was no place.
 There was no room. I reme mber standing in 
a corner holding up a blanket. My mother was 
behind the blanket washing and vice versa. So, 
sanitary conditions didn™t exist. At night, we sl
ept on the floor. In the daytime, we sat on the 
floor. Crowded, one body next to the other. An
d eventually, six weeks later, we were 
assigned to various rooms througho
ut the ghetto on both sides of the bridges. The older part 
of the ghetto was the Balut, the former slum of
 the city. It used to house Jews and non-Jews, 
but had been vacated for Jews only. We were 
fortunate enough to be settled in the little 
newer section on the front side of the bridge. 
We  shared a probably 10 by 10 foot room with 
four other people. We  had two or three wooden 
cots. My mo ther brought a little wardrobe so 
we didn™t have to hang the clothing on the da
mp  walls. The view out of the window was a 
barbed wire and the red century house with 
a German ma rching up and down. So, we  did not 
go near the window. At night, you had to put a bl
ack sheet over the window so no light could 
come  out because it was wartime. And the room
 had a little cast iron stove, but there was no 
lumber. We  slowly took out of the wooden cots on
e board at a time, cut it up for heat and for 
cooking. We  were issued ration cards, and the 
food distribution centers
 were throughout the 
ghettos. The intervals of the spaces between them were several kilometers. When a food 

ration was announced or posted on the walls, it gave
 a date when it would be available, and 
how much, and what items. You had to bring yo
ur own containers, and during the first week, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
46 
 
 
you stood in line for about three hours until you got your food. If you waited beyond that, 
there were no more lines but some times the food ran out.  
Q:  And this was hot food.  

A: No. 

Q:  No, this was- 

A:  This was a little bit of brown sugar at a time,
 a little bit of what they called ground coffee, a 
loaf of bread for a certain period of time , 
some ti me s there was flour. Once I got horsemeat, 
but only once. And it was not really enough to 
sustain a huma n being. And the conversation 
wherever you went centered around food. The hous
es had no running water. You had to carry 

a bucket up and a bucket down with dirty water. 
There were no bathrooms. The toilets were 
outhouses in the backyard. There were no showers. There were no bathtubs. There was no 

transpor tation within the ghetto to get from one 
place to anot he r. There was an internal police 
force. There was a fire br igade. I don™t think it was ever used, and aside fr om the police force 
there was a 
Sonder
 force, that meant special police with speci al or ders, with more diff icult 
tasks which larger, with larger food allotmen
ts, and some  of these me n were decent, and 
some  were brutal. 
Q:  Lucille, let™s stop now and change the tape. 
End of Tape 2

Tape 3 
Q:  Lucille, I usually don™t do this, but I wanted
 to give a sense to those people who will watch 
the interview that, as far as 
I know, there were over 31,000 departme nts in the Lódz ghetto, 
and a little over 700 had running water. Just fo
r a people to get a sense of this population of 
over 200,000 people, what you were living in, in 
terms of the sheer physical conditions let 
alone everything else. 
A:  None of my friends or ac
quaintances had running water. I ha
d one friend that I did not know 
until after the war who lived in the parsonage 
of a church and there was running water, but 
nobody knew. There were houses out in Marysin,
 where Rumkowski lived, they had running 
water. It was the slum of a city. Running water 
was not the customary thing to have. The city 
also didn™t have a sewer system. The sewage 
ran between the street 
and the sidewalk, raw 
sewage, and you jumped over it as you cr
ossed the street. There was no underground 
canalization like for instance in Wa rsaw or 
in Paris or in Rome . It didn™t exist.  
Q:  So, the stench must have been unbelievable. 
A:  So, was the typhus Œ the stench, the typhus, th
e summers, the snow and frost in the winter, 
and people just dumped their buckets and it didn
™t ma tter. It Œ you had ceased to care, to 
observe sanitary conditions or 
laws. There was really no way one could solve this problem. It 
was Œ it was not solvable. 
Q:  So, I™m just trying to get a sense of time . 
Those first six weeks, th
is is the most shocking 
thing that happens to you Œ I m
ean, other than the shock of the 
death of your father, but that™s 
a different kind of a shock. This
 is a physical as well as a ps
ychological shock to you to be 
taken to Lódz and to be livi
ng under conditions that you™ve ne
ver come  Œ you™ve never lived 
like this. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
48 
 
 
A:  Nope. It was a shock, and yet we believed, 
in the first six weeks, that once we get housing, 
once we get a room in a building, be  it wood or concrete, conditions would be more 
norma lized. It never really occurred to us that
 most buildings would 
not have a bathroom. I 
thought there would be ma ybe a bathroom on ea ch
 floor or a shower. The ghetto did have a 
bathhouse, but you needed a coupon to get i
n. The ghetto had a laundry. Once I had a coupon 
and I bought some  sheets, and it took me  six mont
hs to get them back. They were sort of 
washed, but six months because the laundry did 
work for the Germans and for the higher-ups 
within the ghetto. So, while some  of the civi li
zed amenities were within the ghetto, they were 
far and in between. 
Q:  And, during this, before you moved to Pawia St
reet, these first four 
to six weeks, do you see 
Œ you™re living with 1,100 people in a very small building. Do people change a lot? Do 

people start fighting with each other?  Do you se
e things even amongst the three of you where 
there are changes and it™s difficult? 
A:  It was stressful. People di d argue. ﬁThis 
was my space and why did you take my space?ﬂ And 
ﬁtake this away and put this th
ere.ﬂ It was community
 living at its worst. It brought out the 
very best in very few people.
 It brought out the worst inmo st of us. And I don™t think 
anybody was really to blame because to come  
out of the normal life into conditions of 

deprivation, of inhuma nity, dehuman
ization Œ it™s indescribable. 
Q:  How™d your mother change? 

A:  She became very quiet. When we first cam
e into the ghetto, she thought, because she spoke 
Polish, she had lived among Poles, she had lived
 among Jews in Poland, she was educated in 
Lwow, she thought it would be ma nageable. It w
ould be possibly a little 
bit the way her life 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
49 
 
 
had been before the first World Wa r. But I don™
t think she fully expected the hunger, and the 
filth, and the sickness within the ghetto. That
 was some thing that was incomprehensible. 
Q:  Your sister is 11, and you™re 
16. So, what is it for her?  Is it 
harder for her because she™s so 
much younger?  Or is it not harder? 
A:  No, it wasn™t harder for her. She just t
ook it more or less in stride. She didn™t quite 
understand what this was all a
bout. She once asked about the ba
rbed wires or the soldiers 
with guns. She rema rked once on the lack of a 
playground. Or she wanted a little roll with 
butter and there were no rolls in the ghetto. But 
she did not Œ it did not have a full impact on 
her, not at that point. 
Q:  Did she have friends? 
A:  No, nobody. 

Q:  Nobody had them. 

A:  Nobody. 
Q:  So, the kids did not play. 
A:  There were very few kids. There were ma
inly elderly people. There were quite a few 
teenagers, but kids eight or 10 far in between. 
Q:  What about you?  What happened to y
ou during those first couple of months? 
A:  Well, I went throughout the building to s
ee if there was anybody I knew. I me t a couple of 
classmates, schoolma tes. I looked at the young 
people who brought the soup, and laid out the 
portions. And I was guessing or thinking how doe
s one get a job like th
at, but I had trouble 
with the language. I could understand some  of
 the Yiddish, and Polish I had probably a dozen 
words, no more. So, there was no communication. There was no possibility to ma ke any 

connection.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
50 
 
 
Q:  But, there are, I don™t know
, at least a few thousand Germans who went into the Lódz ghetto, 
am I right? 
A:  Over a period of time. 
Q:  But not when you came?  

A:  Not when we came. Later on, there were tr ansports Œ several from Berlin, several from 
Vienna, five from Prague, one 
from Frankfurt. I think ther
e were in excess of 20,000 people 
brought in from what wa s called ﬁWe s tern Europe.ﬂ At that time , we were told we didn™t 

read it and we didn™t hear it, of a speech 
ma de by Rumkows ki that 20,000 Jews had been 
brought in from the We st and there was neit
her enough housing for them, a nd the Germans 
would ma ke no allowances for it, and there wa
s not enough food for them. It was considered 
a tremendous burden on the already existing 
ghetto population. And we we re very 
unwelcome . We were ma de fun of. We were the 
ones from the  We st, the spoiled ones, the 
arrogant ones. And in a way, it was true. The ma jo
rity of the German Jews especially, not so 
much the Czechs, came with the idea, or at least 
if they didn™t come  with
 it, it started within 
the ghetto, ﬁWe will teach them how to do things
 here, and we will change things in the 
ghetto. And we will run the ghetto the way we ar
e used to running things in Germany.ﬂ And 
that turned out to be a big mi stake.  
Q:  Because ther e was a lot of hostility? 

A:  There was a lot of hostility, and you can™t 
walk into some body else™s house and turn it 
upside-down. And of course, the Polish Jews woul
d not hold still for it, which resulted in the 
fact that there was no employment for us. We  
wer e  by and large disliked. We were called 
name s, not nasty name s, but not flattering na
me s either. You felt almost like an outcast 

among your own people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
51 
 
 
Q:  So, you were in Œ it™s not the same  situat
ion you were in Germany with the Nazis or the 
German non-Jews against you. But th
ere™s somewhat of a similarity
 within the c
ontext of this 
horrible situation. 
A:  Yes, but I was used to this situation. I we
nt to a German-Jewish school. And the school had 
about ten children who had Polish parents. And 
when this became known, the parents of the 
Œ of all those students said, ﬁDon™t play withthose Polish Jews .ﬂ So, it was Jew against Jew 
on the one side. It was the same  again now. And 
that, at that very beginning, some thing told 
me  that you were sitting again between two chai
rs. If you want to live here in any way and 
get work, you have to learn the language - Yi
ddish and Polish. And it was hard; there was no 
school. 
Q:  So, how did you learn? 

A:  By listening and by talking. And I made horri
ble mi stakes but people smiled. They thought it 
was very cute that a 16 year old would at leas
t try. It took me six months and I spoke Polish 
gramma tically incorrect. I didn™
t know if two houses were ma le or fema le, but it didn™t 
ma tter. People found it amusing, and it helpe
d. It gave me  a chance at communication. 
Q:  And, your mother could speak. 
A:  My mother was educated and sh
e spoke Polish, and French, and German. 
Q:  Did she try to get a job or wa
s she Œ or did she not even try? 

A:  She tried at very first, but nobody would hi
re in 1941. There was not 
enough work within the 
ghetto to fully employ everybody. Work was not 
ma ndatory; it was not considered forced 
labor. You worked and you received the noontim
e soup. But you didn™t have to work if you 
didn™t want to. It afforded you no other privileges. 
Q:  Except the noontime soup. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
52 
 
 
A:  Right, because money was very little and wort
hless. So, she tried for a while in the felt shoe 
factory and in the hat factory, 
but they wouldn™t hire her. 
Q:  So, the people who are wo
rking are getting noontime soup plus
 the rations that you are all 
getting. And you would cook these rations 
in your little room Œ or try to. 
A:  If we had enough ma terial to
 hit the little stove 
because sometimes you got items that weren™t 
even combinable or cookable, but we  would tr
y in the evening. And if
 you shared a room, 
and you had a corner for your food supplies or a 
shelf, it very often ha
ppened that by evening 
some thing had disappeared. Some body in the room
 was so hungry, they couldn™t resist. That 
was very, very common.  
Q:  So, how quickly did you f
eel that you were starving? 
A:  I think with Œ within two months, ma ybe two 
and a half mont hs. We  were definitely starving 
by the end of the year, before Christma sti me. 
Q:  And thirsty, I would imagine, or not? 
A:  We did drink the water. 
Q:  You did? 

A:  Yes, that™s why we got typhus. It wa s really 
not much else to drink because it was difficult to 
heat up water, to bring it to a boil, and to ma ke
 this so-called coffee th
at we were distributed. 
I reme mber one ration and it was four pounds of 
salt. I reme mber a ration of a half a pound 
of citric acid. Citric acid thrown into a pot of
 raw vegetables ma kes it 
boil faster, but what are 
you going to do with that quantity. It was a sens
eless type of distribution, but the food was 
distributed the way it came  into the ghetto from
 Germany. There were, we heard, other items, 
but they were in small supply and they went to
 the elite of the ghetto admi nistration, not to 
us. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
53 
 
 
Q:  I™m worried about the sound. Is
 that going to be all right?  
[Break in tape] 

Q:  Could you take some  of these rations and go 
to this ma rket Œ there was an outdoor ma rket, 
and try to get some  food of some
 kind, or was there very little? 
A:  Again, during the first si
x months there was an outsid
e area where you could buy a rotten 
apple or frozen potato, or whatever anybody else
 would like to sell. 
You could trade. You 
could barter, but it was pretty senseless. 
You didn™t gain much by it. And the ma rket 
eventually just closed down for lack of
 interest and for lack of supplies.  
Q:  So, let me  ask you some t hing. So, you™re in 
Pawia Street, in the e
nd of November, beginning 
of December? Some
thing like that? 
A:  Yes.  

Q:  Now, your mother™s 50
th
 birthday is January 5
th
. 
A:  Right. 
Q:  1942. 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  And she™s beginning to de
teri orat e at  this point. 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  With a disease or by starvation, her body is–? 

A:  Well, starvation takes a strange form. Your body swells. Your legs 
and your feet become  
double its normal size. It is difficu
lt to walk. You can™t get into 
a pair of shoes. Those are the 
first signs of starvation. It does ul
timately affect you in other ways, 
as well. It is just that the 
body responds to lack of nourishment. 
Q:  And this is what was happening to her? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
54 
 
 
A:  This was happening to her and thousands of others. 
Q:  So, what could you do for her?  Wa s there 
anything that could be done?  Did you try with 
some  desperation to get food, to get more food, rather? 
A:  The only thing that I could 
try is sell whatever of my clot
hing I did not need or I did not 
want. And that I gradually sold for food, but I 
didn™t have much clothi
ng to start out with, 
and I only had two pair of shoes in not very
 good condition. Shoes would have brought a lot 
of money. The stockings were in such disrepai
r that the repairs on the back of the heel 
reached halfway up to the knee. We kept re
pairing it with thread
 because you couldn™t buy 
new ones. But you could buy a lipstick. 
Q:  What? 

A:  The ghetto had a little cosmetic store half
 a block from Balutaring. 
And I guess the lady must 
have had a cosmetic store before the war,
 and you could go and buy powder or lipstick, and 
on the corner was a hairdresser and you could 
get a permane nt if you had the right currency 
or enough food. 
Q:  And there were enough people to keep ope
n this cosmetic store who would buy things? 
A:  I do not how much rent they paid. I don™t 
know who owned the building. 
It was a little shack. 
There was dema nd. The ladies or wome n who we
re in fact within the ghetto were well-
dressed. They wore hats. They wore decent boots
 or shoes, and they wore cosmetics. The 
ghetto had several tiny little hol
es in the wall and you could ge
t a ma nicure for one Mark. 
But you had to have the Mark. 
Q:  And I gather you never did that. 

A:  I did it once. 

Q:  Did you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
55 
 
 
A:  Yes. I once had a Mark. I just 
wanted to now what it was like. 
Q:  Because you had never ha d one before? 

A:  No. 

Q:  And what did you think? 

A:  I think Œ I thought it was totally
 superfluous. It wa s ridiculous, 
but I liked to see people with 
that bright red nail polish, which I™ve never worn
 since. And it was very fashionable because 
wome n, Jewish wome n i n Lódz, were very eleg
ant, emancipated, very We stern, very anti-
religious customs, and quite differe
nt from what I had expected.  
Q:  So, they were more modern in 
some ways than where you came from. 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  If one wants to use that kind of terminology. 

A:  But, then, I also was older than Œ than I 
observed the same  circumstances as a child. So, I 
was more aware. 
Q:  Did you ever buy lipstick? 

A:  My mother had a lipstick that she had bought 
in Paris during the Worl
d™s Fair. I think it was 
™36 or some thing like that, 
and I used that lipstick. 
Q:  So, you did use lipstick. 

A:  Later on, not right away
, later on as I got older. 
Q:  Did your mo ther ma ke-up he
rself so you would look better? 
A:  Before the war, she used lipstick but then
 she rubbed it off so it wouldn™t be so obvious. She 
had her hair done once a week. 
Q:  You™re talking about Germany now. 

A:  Yes, and she used powder and other cosm
etics, but it was of no interest to me. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417

Q:  So, when your mother begins to take on the 
symp toms of wha t  one mi
ght call the disease of 
starvation, the diseases that come  with starvati
on, do you kids sit in the house Œ the apartment 
with her? 
A:  We did at first, and then
 one evening we had knock at the 
door. It must have been around 
January. And in walked a shor
t little man by the name of Ad
olf Goetz, and he had lived 
around the corner from us in Hambur g on Holle 
Street. We  lived on Braumsen Way (ph). We  
didn™t know him but we™d wave from the back 
window. He had a short little wife with very 
curly hair and she used to shake out her rugs
 off the balcony. And he came in with another 
ma n and he used to be a dentist in Ha
mburg. I think it was Rosenblum. And he had 
reme mbered us and he said to my mo ther, ﬁI 
have been given permission to open an office. 
Would you allow your daughter to work in that 
office? ﬂ My mother said, ﬁSure.ﬂ ﬁWell, she 
doesn™t get much mone y. You know
 how it is, but she™ll get a da
ily soup.ﬂ Adolph Goetz had 
a terrific sense of humor. He was probably not ev
en five foot tall. He wore glasses, and he 
had a funny face that you would expect to see in
 a cartoon, a very pinched little face. He had 
been a playwright. He had been an engineer. 
He had a son in South America some  place, and 
he convinced Rumkows ki that the ghetto ne
eded improve me nt and beautification. And he 
hired probably a dozen architects and engineers 
that had come  from Prague on this so-called 
Intelligenz
 transport, as they called themselves because everybody had a college de gree, 
among the m the general director of Schoda 
(ph), which was Dr. Reich. And they were 
supposed to draw up blue prints with parks, w
ith schools, with trees, 
with playgrounds. And I 
was supposed to do some typing, but I couldn™t type
 very well, and write the explanations to 
these blueprints. And every once in a while 
Adolph Goetz would take the blueprints to 

Balutaring, to Rumkows ki, and Rumkowski seemed enthused. And we got the mi dday soup. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
57 
 
 
The office was on Rybn, 8. And oh, Adolph must have
 been in his late ™60s at a guess, and 
for fun he wrote poems and he wrote stories. A
nd he would make little airplanes out of them, 
and just sort of fly the m over the office onto 
my desk. That went on for several months. I 
didn™t know what to make it, but it was sort of
 funny. But he complained bitterly about the 
lack of food, but the office rema ined for a
bout six months, and then he was summoned by 
Rumkowski, and he was told, ﬁI™m terminati
ng the office. I™m closing down the office. And 

all of you can look for other jobs
.ﬂ In the meantime, he had 
gotten double rations, which of 
course I didn™t know. And he was really unha
ppy for hims elf and for us, as well. And 
everybody tried to get a job some place else. Dr. Re ich went to work for the lumber 

departme nt for Goodma n. Some  others found 
e mployment some place else, and by then it 
was July. And my mother died on the 30
th
 of July 1942 of hunger. 
Q:  Were you with her? 

A:  No, I was not at home. It happened in the 
afternoon, and the next da
y the black little wagon 
with the white horse came and picked up the d
ead bodies throughout th
e ghetto. We  did not 
hear. My sister and I walked to the Jewish 
cemetery in Marysin, about a two-hour walk. And 
in the burial hall, we went through hundreds of bodies. And most bodies we re between two 

boards, wooden boards, tied together with a st
ring and a name tag. We  found my mot her™s 
body. And we took two shovels. And we looked for 
a plot and there were no more plots left 
on the cemetery. So, we found a walkway, and we 
spent that July day digging a grave until it 
was deep enough to bury her. We  put a wooden ma rker on it. We  scratched the name  with a 

stone on the ma rker, and we walked back. Fr
om that day on, I think, my sister stopped 
talking. 
Q:  Stopped? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
58 
 
 
A:  Talking. I couldn™t get through to her. I l
ooked around for a school for 
her. I couldn™t find a 
school. But I heard that one of
 the factories in the back 
room employed children, but it 
actually was a school. I tried several. And I was 
asked by the directors of
 the factories, ﬁIf I 
give you a pl ace for your sister, what will you give  
me  in return? ﬂ  And I explained that I had 
no jewelry nor did I have money. And the answ
er was laughter. I did not comprehend. In the 
end, I did find her a place. I asked her if she en
joyed it, if she learne d Polish, if there were 
other children Œ she wouldn™t 
answer. And, I, in the meanti me , looked for work. I found 
some  work in the factory sewing ladies™ dresse
s, but it was a two hour walk to Marysin. And 
I worked at a machine for a while. And the in
teresting part in that factory was that it 
employed young people my age, a little older, an
d they were very intent on striking, on 
asking for more food. One young woma n na me d Fajg
a ma de us walk, those willing to walk, 
around the courtyard, ﬁNo food. No work.ﬂ It 
took an hour, and the police Œ the Jewish 
ghetto police Œ came into the cour
tyard and took her away. She re
turned the next day a little 
bit black and blue, and she laughed. 
Q:  She laughed? 
A:  She laughed. She had a boyfriend and she sai
d, ﬁWe™re not going to give up. We ™re going to 
organize for food.ﬂ By that time , I got afraid. But there were brave souls who still ma rched, 

ﬁNo Food, no soup, no work.ﬂ ﬁNo food, no workﬂ 
in Yiddish and Polish, and she was taken 
away a second time. The first time  she was warned to cease and desist, not by Rumkowski, 

but by some one who was sent by him. And whe n she was taken the second time, she didn™t 

return for a week. She came back in very bad 
shape: black and blue, a mi ssing tooth, and she 
no longer demonstrated. By then it wa s September, and the announcements were of the

ghetto Œ No, first Rumkowski made a speech th
at the Germans had demanded that the ol d 
and the very young be deported from the ghetto, a
nd he had to comply with German orders.  
Q:  Can I - because these are the big de
portations Œ can I go back a little bit? 
A:  Yes, there wa s one in May that I had skipped. 
Q:  May of ™42, before your mother died. 

A:  Yes, and that took out most of the elderly Je
ws that had come  from the West, most of them 
with very few exceptions. We  were on the list
. And I took our three Polish passports. And I 
went from one admi nistration to the other to 
convince them t hat we were not German. And 
some body i n the admi nistration who worked for Ne
ftalin, his name  was 
Kaplan, finally, after 
two days agreed to delete our name s and we st
ayed. That was in May before my mothe r  died. 
Q:  And did you have an instinct that anot
her deportation couldn™t
 possibly be better? 
A:  We had the instinct Œ here we knew of the 
mi sery. If you go some place else, what is going to 
await us?  We  had no idea. And I would say 
by an old Jewish saying, ﬁWhat you have you 
have. You know, you know your enemy. If you go
 someplace else, what will you have?ﬂ We 
did not know. So, the instinct Œ our instinct 
was Œ I don™t know how other people felt because 
we had very, very little contact
 with other Jews that had come  from the West except for the 
Eichengreens, who really didn™t care. 
They thought it couldn™t be worse. 
Q:  This is Jules and Julius. 

A:  Right, and Œ but, we decided, my mother 
and I, that it would 
be better to stay. 
Q:  And your mother by then 
is not very well, anyway. 
A:  No, she was not well. It was my doing that 
we were permitted to stay, because I ran around 
with these Polish passports speaking German. 
And people just looked at me . They just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
60 
 
 
laughed. It was a joke. It couldn™t be for r
eal. Some body who has a nati
onality can speak the 
language, but in the end, they agreed. We
 could stay. After my  mother died– 
Q:  I want to ask you a question. It™s very unusua
l, I think, for two childre
n to not me taphorically 
bury their mother but to really bury– 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  –one of their parents. 

A:  You never forget. 

Q:  I would imagine. It must have been one of the worst days of your life in your me mory. 

A:  I have not been back to a funeral for 50 y
ears. And I™ve had friends 
and relatives die, and I 
could not go. I could not go to my father™s gr
ave. I couldn™t go in a cemetery. It was not 
feasible. 
Q:  How did you do it, the two of 
you?  You carried your mother™s body? 
A:  Yes, with those two boards. How di
d we do it? I really can™t answer that. 
Q:  And did you say to each other, ﬁWe have to bury her.ﬂ 

A:  We didn™t speak. 

Q:  You just did it. 

A:  We just did it. 

Q:  Did you see anyone else doing that? 

A:  No. It was a hot July, on the 20
th
 of July, ma ybe 21
st
. We  didn™t see a soul. There was no 
caretaker. There were no gravediggers. There was nobody. 
Q:  Were you crying when you were digging? 

A:  No. 

Q:  You were just digging. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
61 
 
 
A:  No tears. 
Q:  And did you say prayers? 

A:  No, no prayers. 

Q:  You just finished and left? 

A:  And left. 

Q:  And did you and Karin hold hands walking back to hold on to each other. 

A:  I think we did because it was a long walk. 

Q:  And did you go back home?  

A:  We went back to the room. 

Q:  Ho me . 

A:  Yeah. 

Q:  And clearly you did not whatever 
sitting shiva would be, you did not. 
A:  No. 
Q:  So, there™s no Œ you can™t mourn, you just have to- 
A:  No, there was Œ whether you shut out the feel
ings consciously or whether there just we re no 
more feelings left, I will never know. 
Q:  So, you never cried. 

A:  Not then. 

Q:  Not then. And Karin simply stops talking. 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  I mean, really physically- 

A:  Really physically stopped ta
lking. ﬁYesﬂ and ﬁnoﬂ was about 
the most I got out of her. 
Q:  And do you know whether she was talking 
when she went to school, or did she–? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
62 
 
 
A:  I assume  not, but I never went to the school 
because I had to go to work. I assumed she didn™t 
talk. 
Q:  And of course in that circumstance so ma
ny people were suffering, who™s going to take care 
of this little kid?  
A:  Right, and then there were other 
little kids. She wasn™t the only one. 
Q:  Now, you tell this st ory about this person 
who says, ﬁWhat will you gi ve in exchange?ﬂ You 
did not understand. What do you understand now?  What was he doing? 
A:  Well, I learned in three years in the ghe
tto, that you pay for sex Œ you pay with sex for a 
favor, but I did not understand it then. 
Q:  So, you came to understand that
 this was not an unusual feat
ure of the ghetto for women? 
A:  Not within the next Œ wi
thin the following two years. 
Q:  You learned that. 
A:  That I learned, but not in 1942. In ™43 and ™44, yes. 
Q:  Okay, so September come s– 
A:  And the first I heard from a young me ssenger who delivered me ssages from the 
admi nistration. She was a dwarf Œ crippled, Jewish, grew up in the orphanage. 
Q:  In the old orphanage? 

A:  Yes, yes. 

Q:  Where was it? 

A:  Helenowek. 

Q:  Helenowek. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
63 
 
 
A:  She was very, very poor. They lived in one 
room in a little suburb. She had a brother and a 
sister olde r, no mother, and a father, and she to
ld me  that Rumkowski had ma de a speech that 
morning, or would ma ke a speech the next morning. 
Q:  Now, this is Branya. 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  Okay. 

A:  The essence of the speech was that th
e Germans had dema nde d 20,000 sick, elderly, and 
children, mo st of them c hildren to be sent out
 of the ghetto. And the wording of the speech 
was, and that I think is a ma tter of record, ﬁM
others and fathers, give me  your children so 

that the rest of us ma y live 
and survive.ﬂ There were outcrie
s, ma ybe a s t one or two were 
thrown, but police was pr esent. He tried to ex
plain that he tried to negotiate that they 
wouldn™t take children over 11 years of age, but 
they would have to take the sick. He got the 
number decreased by a thousand 
and various other justifications. Those who heard the speech 
and those who found about it were appalled. It
 wa s Œ the concept was unthinkable. During 
the process, that the deportation was announ
ced by Rumkowski, and by the time he had the 
lists on the streets of the pe
ople written up, the Germans got angry and impatient. They 
enforced a curfew of seven days starti
ng in September, I believe it was the 7
th
. We were not 
supposed to be out on the street for seven days
 and seven nights. The Germans ca me  i nto the 
ghetto with trucks, with dogs and with guns. They
 went from street to
 street and from house 
to house, and the square area of the ghetto 
was not very large. And it went house by house. 
They came to our street. We had a neighbor si
t on the roof and look out. And when they 
entered the courtyard, they shouted for ever
ybody to assemble in the courtyard. And then 
they went into the building and found those w
ho had hidden. They beat them and put them on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
64 
 
 
the truck. And then the looked at the rema inder 
of those standing in the courtyard, probably 
60 people, and within five mi nutes, they sepa
rated the old and the young from the more fit 
huma n beings. My sister, although she was 11 y
ears old, not 10, was taken. I tried to go onto 
the truck with her. The guns stopped me . The 
truck drove off. My neighbor™s mother was 
taken Œ ma ny people out of the building. He was a policeman. He couldn™t get his mother 
released. We never found out where they were
 taken, what was done with them, wher e they 
supposedly were resettled, in wh
at labor camp they mi ght have been sent. But eventually, a 
few packages of clothing came back into the 
ghetto. And supposedly Œ I did not see it Œ some  
of the clothing was blood-stained. Actual note
s or actual letters I don™t believe were found. 
Nobody could give us an answer. We  hoped that 
they were alive Œ some place, some where. 
And the curfew was lifted after seven days, and lif
e continued for the rest of us. It was almost 
as if we had been hypnotized, as if we just Œ we
 just went on. We went 
to work. We  collected 
the soup. We collected the food 
ration. It continued. We  had been robbed not of our children, 
but of our feelings, of our compassion. Some  
children were hidden, but very few. How he 
could have asked to hand over the childre
n, I did not understand at 16. I don™t understand it 
now. Did he have a choice?  I would say so. C
zerniakow had a choice. I mean, his life was 
not so precious that he could not have said no. 
He  could have refused to obey the orders. He 
would have paid the price, but to ask this of
 the community is unthinkable. I was fired from 
the dress factory. I don™t know 
for what reason, probably incomp
etence. I did not sew very 
well. And I went back to the office on Rybna, 
8 because I knew a woma n there from Vienna. 
And by then it was October, and it was cold, 
and we stood around the 
stove and I said, ﬁI 
need a job desperately.ﬂ And her boss, who sat 
a desk in the corner, came  over. He started 
talking to me, and by then I spoke Polish and 
Yiddish, and he said, ﬁI™ll give you a job.ﬂ I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
65 
 
 
said, ﬁDoing what?ﬂ And he said, ﬁWe have recei
ved truckloads of for ms t o be completed for 
the Germans in Germany for their coal rati
ons. And the forms  have to be fi gured and 
completed. And you™ll sit in the office. I need 
300 people. You write down the name s. People 
will tell you they™ll work here. Y
ou just get their addresses, a
nd you just do it.ﬂ I said, ﬁOkay, 
I™ll do it. A job is a job.ﬂ His boss was Henryk Ne
ftalin, the attorney, who was in his late 30s. 
A very fair ma n. A very able ma n. I had me
t his mother when I was running around with 
those passports a year earlier. And he was much
 admi red. The strange thing was that he had 
Rumkowski ™ s ear. When he would go to Rumkowsk
i, he mi ght take some abuse, but in the 
end, he would argue. And half the time, Rumk
owski would listen. So, he was much admi red. 
His girlfriend worked in one of
 the admi nistrative offices. Her 
name  was Klatalka (ph). And I 
worked in that office, I would say, until ™43, end of ™43. And one day Bernard Fuchs decided 

Œ he was the head of the Departme nt of Labor 
Œ that too ma ny people worked in that office, 
and he needed people in the st
raw shoe factory for the Russian front. And the commis sion of 
several dignitaries came, among 
the m Rumkows ki. And it was ag
ain a selection of who goes 
and who stays. And I hid pretty muc h to the 
bitter end until I was cal
led, because they had 
my na me  on the list. And Rumkows ki sat on a ch
air. He had taken off his hat and his coat, 
and he had his cane in his right hand. And for 
a minute, heremi nded me
 of a fairy tale Œ a 
king sitting on a throne. He spoke
 to me  in Yiddish and he as
ked me my name, whether I had 
fa mily, where I had come from, and in the e
nd he said, ﬁLittle Germ
an, you ma y stay, and 
you™ll hear fr om me.ﬂ He took a 
lot of people out of that offi
ce at that particular time. 
Bernard Fuchs threw out the list as he had dr
awn up previous deportati
on lists. I had gone to 
his office when I was jobless and asked hi
m for employment  because he was born in 

Hannover, Germany, a nd he spoke German. And afte r my third visit, he lost his temper, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
66 
 
 
he said that he had not jobs, th at I was a pest, or the equivale
nt in Polish. He opened the door 
and he yelled like a German, ﬁ
Raus!
ﬂ 
Q:  And when did this happen? 
A:  Before I got the job- 

Q:  With Goetz? 

A:  -with Goetz, and then again after I lost the 
job with Goetz, twice. And then there was a third 
time when I lost the job in the clothing f
actory. I saw him throughout the ghetto, some times 
in a carriage, some ti me s not. He knew me  
because there were not ma ny people who came 
from Ha mburg who had been to Hannover, w
ho could speak German. I also went for an 
interview to Balutari ng with his si ster Dora 
Brooks. She wouldn™t hire me , no reason given. 
Q:  She was the executive secretary to Ru mkowski, so she had a very high position. 

A:  She was mo re than that. She was his ears 
and his mouth because Rumkowski could not speak 
to the Germans in any language. She could speak
. She could speak Polish, and by then, with 
the same accent I had, and she could speak Germ
an. I went to Walchovna (ph). I went to a 
whole variety of wome n who were
 in factories. And there were ma ny that were capable, that 
were intelligent, but they wouldn™t hire a 
woman. That was competition Œ a man, yes Œ a 
woma n, no. So, I went back to work, and a few 
weeks later, my boss Henryk Neftalin called 
me  into his office and he said, ﬁI™m transfer
ring you to the Statistical Departme nt on Plac 
Koscielny, 4.ﬂ I didn™t want to leave because I™d
 become  very friendly with Spiege l and I did 
not like the unknown. But you didn™t argue with 
Henryk Neftalin. He was fair. He was 
decent. What his reasons were, I neve r knew. They could have  been several. It could ha ve 

been that he wanted me  out of Rumkowski™s reach
. It could have been th
e fact that I came to 
work one day with a very bloody face when I 
had been sent to the Kripo because some body 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
67 
 
 
said I had a radio, and I never did have a 
radio. And he saw my bloody scars, my bloody 
face, my bruised eyes. He  transferred me  because
 in essence he  was the actual head of the 
Statistical De partme nt. He had the first word 
and the last word. It 
was a long way to work 
over the bridge. And in winter it was hard to 
walk, so they unshoveled snow on the bridge. 
You slid back rather than forward. Hundreds 
of people cross the bridge every morning, and 
you were afraid that somebody would carry lice 
and they would jump over on your clothing. 
That was the greatest fear because they carried typhus. The office– 
Q:  I want to stop. I don™t like doing this, but 
I want to go back because you™re now moving 
much too fast, and I really don™t have much
 ti me . So, I™ll tell you what we™re going to do. 
We™re going to stop the tape. And then, I™m going 
to come  back and we™ll go a little bit more 
slowly. 
A:  Okay. 
End of Tape 3

Tape 4 
 
Q:  Lucille, I want to bring us  back 
because you move d much too quickly for me. 
A:  I™m sorry. 
Q:  Don™t be sorry, it™s fine. You said whenKarin was taken away, you all Œ and Karin is, well, 
she™s going with children. There™s also 70,000 pe
ople, I think who™s in these deportations 

during this couple of mo nths. Am I not right? 
A:  No, I don™t think 70. I think it was in May 
around 15 or 20, and then again in September, 
there were a lot of smaller deportations in 
between a thousand or 2,000. The actual numbers I 
don™t know, but the ghetto at any one time had roughly 160,000 people. 
Q:  But, it was a few thousand people over the course- 

A:  Over the course, yes. 

Q:  You said that people went on, and what you lost
 in some  ways was your feelings. So, in order 
to go on, you clearly didn™t forget Ka rin, but 
you couldn™t respond to 
her going, I gather, in 
some  way. 
A:  Well, I reached out for her. I tried to go w
ith her. I was not allowe
d, but life in the overall 
ghetto went on. People even went so
 far as to use, at least for 
a week or two, the ration card 
of a person who was deported. So, there was no 
Œ there was no feeling. There was no Œ there 
was a sadness, but there was not a deep desper
ation and there should have been, and that, I 
think two or three years of ghetto
 life killed that  within us. 
Q:  Did you use Karin™s ration 
card?  Did she have one even? 
A:  Yes, she had one. 

Q:  She had one. Did you use it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
69 
 
 
A:  No, I did not. My neighbor asked whether sh
e could pick up the breadon her card, and I said, 
ﬁNo.ﬂ And I handed it into the coupo
n departme nt and let it go at 
that. I just couldn™t because 
I had read a story, and supposedly it was ficti
on of children looking acro
ss a barbed wire at 
the Fehk Etta (ph) bread store 
and there was one across our str
eet on the other side, and they 
looked from the attic down into the bakery a
nd they were talking about the bread and how 
good it smelled, and it went on for quite awhile, 
and then came  the deportations. And, just for 
the deportation, the father was so hungry that he
 stole a pi ece of the children™s bread. And the 
father was deported. The mother and the two 
children hid and rema ined in the ghetto. The 
mother kept the card. She collected the father
™s bread. I don™t know for how long. She gave it 
to the children, and she says, ﬁC
hildren, eat your father™s bread.ﬂ
 And that™s the end of the 
story, and the story was written by Spiegel in the ghetto. It has b
een translated into English. 
Q:  And you knew this story. 
A:  He read this story to me  
when he wrote the first draft. 
Q:  And that was later? 

A:  That was after the Œ it wa s 1943. 

Q:  So, what was it that ma de you not use the 
coupon?  Was there something immoral about it to 
you? 
A:  It was like robbing a grave, ma ybe. I don™t know. I don™t know Œ it wasn™t mi ne to use. It 
wasn™t mi ne to give. It was hers. I 
can™t give you the reason. I do not know.  
Q:  So, she™s taken away in September. 

A:  Yeah. 

Q:  You work for Goetz ends when in October? 

A:  No, it ended before deportation. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
70 
 
 
Q:  Before deportation. So, you™re four to six w
eeks without a job before 
you get the job Œ before 
Spiegel meets you. 
A:  No, I first go to the clothing factory in be
tween and then I go back to Rybna,8 , and Spiegel 
gives me  a job. That was pretty muc h the end of ™42. 
Q:  So, you start working ther
e, working on these forms. 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  You™re filling in forms. 

A:  The coal rations for the German population. 

Q:  And, these coal rations from the Jews- 

A:  No. 

Q:  How does this work? 

A:  This is paperwork. It has nothing to do with 
Jews. It™s like an audit 
at the Internal Revenue. 
He goes over the figures. We  got forms, let™s sa
y, from the city of Berlin, and Mr. Smi t h 
lives in an apartment with four other people. 
He was entitled to a hundred kilo of coal, and 

we had to figure that out. Four times 50 or f
our time s 25 is 100. Then there is Mr. Joe who 
has eight people living in his apartment. Each 
person gets 25 kilos. So, we had to come  up 
with the figures, and there 
were thousands of these for m
s brought into the ghetto in 
containers, and we went through box after box 
doing the clerical work and having them 
shipped out of the ghetto again to Germany, so th
ey could take the forms, give them to their 
people, and have them collect the co
al. All we did was clerical work. 
Q:  I see. So, this had to be a fairly 
quick turnaround, so pe
ople could get there– 
A:  Yes, it had to be a few months, or it 
was for the following year. That I cannot say. 
Q:  So, who are you actually working for?  Spiegel works for Neftalin. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
71 
 
 
A:  I work for Spiegel. 
Q:  And, you work for Spiegel, and are there ot
her people working for Spiegel, or just you? 
A:  The office had about three or four people,
 one of whom was Pushovsky (ph), one was Œ the 
other one wa s Spiegel, I think there was one 
mor e  ma n. I™ m not sure. But there were 300 
people in the office. 
Q:  In the whole office? 

A:  In the whole office doing nothing but these form
s. And while they did the forms, there were 
supervisors, but they all di
rectly worked for Spiegel. 
Q:  So, what did you think of Spiegel when you first me t hi m?  

A:  Well, he wore glasses. He  had slicked-back
 black hair. He walked very deliberately, very 
slowly. He always carried a briefcase. He 
was very absent-minded, and he was always 
writing, in Yiddish, because I peek
ed and I couldn™t read because he wrote very fast. He was 
also quite sure of himself. He had publishe
d already at the age 
of 22 in the Yiddish 
Bletter
 in 
Warsaw. He had taught school for aw
hile. What did I think of him?  
Q:  What did you notice him?  Did you k
now that he was a published person? 
A:  Yes, but I did not pay much attention. He 
was Œ you would call him today a little stuffy, and 
he wore these little black horn-rimme d glasse
s or  wire glasses Œ me
dium height, medium 
built, wore a suit unpresse d. The shirts were a little rumpled. I mean, it wasn™t some body 

who would particularly strike 
you in a crowd, not in a ghetto. 
Q:  So, does he begin when you first start worki
ng there, to come  over to you and ask you read or 
he™s going to read to you?  How Œ because 
you begin a relationship together, how does it 

begin for you? 
A:  He asked me to stay after wor
k, and work ended at eight or nine.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
72 
 
 
Q:  Eight-oh-nine? 
A:  Eight or nine at night. 

Q:  Sorry. 

A:  And the janitor whose name  was Betczak was 
a little bit retarded 
but very sweet, would 
sweep the office. 
Q:  One second that noise is
 really Œ close the door.  
[Break in tape] 

Q:  Lucille, I™m really sorry, there was an awfu
l lot of noise outside. You won™t be interrupted 
again. So, you were starting to 
talk about how you began to have
 a closer relationship with 
Spiegel and you™re talking about the janitor, Betchak? 
A:  Betczak like a bed, Betczak. And, he would 
come and sweep around the offices and he would 
sit there at ten at night or  whatever time it wa
s, and Spiegel would read his drafts on which 

he worked most of the daytime although he wa
sn™t supposed to, and Œ in Yiddish Œ and he 
told me  wha t  to think about them, whether 
they were good or not so good. And I listened, 
and some  of his poetry is very beautiful. And 
the short stories really took me  very mu ch by 
surprised. They were fiction, but they were the 
story of the man who lo
st his horse to hunger, 
or the Germans killed an animal, or the father who stole br ead from the children. He wrote a 

book during the ghetto time that was called ﬁMal
ches Ghettoﬂ Œ ﬁKingdom Ghettoﬂ, and it 
gives a story of the church on the Platske Ch
ernya (ph), and the peopl
e who go in and who go 
out. He had a facility to describe people, and 
the description ran seve
ral pages. It remi nded 
me  of Thomas Mann and the 
Buddenbrooks
. It gave the background of the story, the smell, 
the atmosphere, the air, the grass, the sky. It
 Œ to me  at age 17, it was very impressive.  
Q:  Why did he have to tell you what to think? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
73 
 
 
A:  Because I wa s very young and really didn™t 
know very much. And we sat until ve ry late in 
the office and when the janitor finally had to lo
ck up, he walked me  back to Pawia, 26, and 
that became a habit, a custom. It was noticed in 
the office. It was talked about in the office. 
Some  people ma de fun of it because the age di fference was tremendous. 
Q:  And how different was it? 
A:  It was 20 or 22 years, and I found it very aw
kward. I really didn™t know how I felt about him. 
I admi red him as a writer, or I liked his stor ies. I did not even know whether you could say a 

writer. I did not think that the 
stories would survive the war or 
we would survive the war, and 
then he began writing short poems, 
and I think there are eight or 
nine of them, and they were 
written to me. They were published after the wa
r, and that™s when he said, ﬁIf your mother 
were alive, I would ask her to ma rry you.ﬂ He to
ld me  that he had a daughter, Eva, who died 
in the ghetto at not even a year
 old, and that™s when I found out that he had a wife. He was 
separated from her. I saw once or twice. Some body pointed her out. He  had a couple of 
sisters, several brothers, and ve
ry, very old parents. They prob
ably weren™ t as old as they 
looked old. The father could r
ead and write Yiddish. The moth
er took in laundry for people 
before the wa r. She washed the laundry. She 
hung it up on the roof, and he
 had to sit on the 
roof to watch that the laundry wouldn™t be 
stolen. The poverty in which he grew up was 
incredible. I had never heard of
 such poverty, and I believe that the apartment Œ and I was 
there twice Œ in which hi s parent s lived, and th
e apartment which he shared during their time 
was theirs be fore the war. It was tiny. It was 
dark. There was hardly any furniture. It was the 
kind of poverty that you read a
bout, but you never see it. By 
Spring or Summer in ™43, I was 
taken to the common law police, severely b
eaten, and when I came back to the office, 
nobody said much, but I found out that I ha
d been denounced for having a radio. The 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
74 
 
 
Germans who beat me  up told me  that a wo
ma n had denounced me , and e ventually being a 
ghetto and being a very small area, it becameknown that she had given my name  to the 
common law police. 
Q:  It was his wife? 

A:  His separated wife. 
We  never spoke about it. 
Q:  You never told him.  

A:  He saw it. You couldn™t escape it. My left side
 Œ the whole left side 
of my  face was for weeks 
a me ss, but we never spoke about it. He kept 
bringing me  ba ck to Pawia, 26. He read me  

stories. He wrote more stories. And the followi
ng week he wrote a poem and he wrapped in 
an orange roll with a ribbon 
tied around, and the poem started 
ﬁThe eyes are green.ﬂ The 
poem has be en published in Israel and in Po
land, and in one other 
book is a whole section 
and it says, ﬁFor Cilla.ﬂ This fr
iendship, I wouldn™t ca
ll it a love affair. It was in between the 
two. On one hand, he was selfish. He got from 
Neftalin two weeks™ le
ave to work in the 
bakery, which meant he could eat as much bread as
 he could absorb, but it
 also meant that hi s 
bread ration was not needed by him during the two 
weeks. I™m sure it went to his family, but 
he never offered me  a slice. It hurt. Then I move
d to Lutomi erska, and it was then that he told 
me  that he had written a poem ﬁRaisins and Almo ndsﬂ. The poem was set to music by 

Beigelma nn (ph). It was performe d in the ghe
tto at night, clandestine in a baseme nt. 

Rumkowski read about it because it says in one
 of the voices that ﬁWe are so hungry we have 
nothing to eat. What should the poor child do?ﬂ 
Rumkowski took offense, and he threatened 
deportation, and he said, ﬁAs long as I am here
, you will write no more.ﬂ Neftalin intervened 
with the understanding and the promise that th
ere would be no references to Rumkows ki in 

anything and there weren™t from that point fo
rward. He hated the ma n with vengeance, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
75 
 
 
he always said, ﬁIf you ever get to know hi m, 
be careful.ﬂ I don™t know
 how to translate it, 
probably the closest would 
be, ﬁHe is a pest,ﬂ a 
par c h
 in Yiddish. 
Q:  He spoke to you in Yiddish. 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  So, what did he say to you in Yiddish? 

A:  Spiegel? 

Q:  Yes, what did is say about Rumkows ki? 

A:  ﬁRumkowski is a 
parch
,ﬂ P-A-R-C-H, I think. He would not
 say anymore. He told me  the 
story about the baby™s song. It™s
 a lullaby, so to speak, and 
around that time, Rumkows ki 
came to the office. He did see Spiegel because  he
 sat in the main conference room, and they 
did not look at each ot her. Neftalin took over, 
and he took a lot of people out of the office 

into the factories, st raw factory 
ma inly, and he told me  that I would hear from hi m. And that 
evening, Spiegel again warned me , and in a 
way he was angry because I had done nothing, 
but some how he felt it was partly my fault.  
Q:  About the song? 

A:  No, that Rumkowski had said I will hear from him.  

Q:  So, he saw that scene? 

A:  He saw that scene. And Fuchs didn™t say anyt
hing. He was present, Bernard Fuchs, and then 
Neft alin transferred me to the Statistical 
Department, and Spiegel picked me  up every 
evening. He went over the bridge, picked me  up, 
went back over the bridge to Lutomi erska, 
went back over to the bri
dge to his parents™ house. 
Q:  But, in this period, you™re working there from
 October ™42 until the end of ™43. Is that right? 
A:  No, I would say the mi ddle of ™43. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
76 
 
 
Q:  Okay. So, it™s a number of months. 
A:  Yes, six mo nths, seven months. 

Q:  Now, is there Œ Soon after he starts walk
ing you home , does he take your hand and hold your 
hand? 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  And, is this– 

A:  And, there was on Pawia, 26 Œ and that™s in
 a book, in a poem Œ there was a covered well, 
and the well was covered with a wooden lid, quite 
large, and we would stand on that lid with 
our gloves on and our scarves and our hats a
nd we  would kiss, and there is a story of ﬁ
Der 
Tot Brunnen
ﬂ, ﬁThe Dead We llﬂ, because the well wa
s no longer active. My feelings were 
strange, I could not decide. He would say odd th
ings. After the war, you would be married to 
a fa mous ma n. He was very sure of hims elf. 
Q:  Meaning hims elf?  
A:  Yes. 
Q:  I see. 

A:  He was very sure of himself, very much in 
love, and yet very frighten
ing, and it told me  not 
to worry about the divorce. Now, a divorce co
uld only be granted by Rumkowski, and that 
was not in the picture. I know wh
at my mother would have said. 
Q:  There™s a growl from the world. How bad is that?   

[Break in tape] 

Q:  Okay, well, we™re finally back after this
 long break, and I believ
e where we ended was you 
were going to Œ some body™s whistling Œ is this
 all right? Œ what your mother would have 
thought had she been alive and you told 
her that Spiegel wanted to ma rry you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
77 
 
 
A:  I think she would have told me  that I had 
lost my mi nd, that he had lost his mi nd, and she 
probably would have locked me  up a nd thrown the key away. 
Q:  And why? Because of you or because of hi m?  
A:  That I even dared to get involved, which 
was my  fault, and because he wa s in no way 
suitable, not age-wise, not professionally, 
not Œ she would have 
considered him a ma n 
without a conscience, becau
se he wasn™t divorced. 
Q:  And were these things 
you thought about at the time?  
A:  Mm-h mm.  

Q:  So, you were very- 

A:  I was brought up very proper. 

Q:  So, if that was the case, what in your
 mi nd was going on when you spent evening after 
evening with him and you knew that he was in 
some  way falling in love with you, I suspect, 
no? 
A:  Well, it was the loneliness of being alone. It was a feeling of having some body care for you, 
but on the other hand, I di dn™t talk much. I listen
ed. I didn™t talk because there is a poem and 
it starts, ﬁ
Wer Stricts der ausoy forbissen
ﬂ (ph). ﬁ Why are you so st
ubbornly silent?ﬂ Because 
I was very insecure. I was not comf ortable. In some  way, yes. In some  ways, no. 
Q:  Did he ever ask you a question? 
Or was he always talking at you? 
A:  He was talking at me  Œ very few questions. 
He wanted to know about 
the parents. He wanted 
to know about the home. But they were almo
st scientific questions. They were not 
particularly personal or info
r mative or desiring to know. 
Q:  Is it the case that at some  point he said 
that he wanted to live 
with you if you couldn™t get 
married? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
78 
 
 
A:  Yes, he did say that, and I 
said I would not consider that, es
pecially not in the ghetto, where 
all these various affairs were public knowledge. 
I was brought up too strict and too proper to 
have thrown all caution to the wind. If I had 
known then of the duration of the ghetto, of 
Auschwitz, of Neuengamme, or Bergen-Belsen, 
I mi ght have said, ﬁWhy not? ﬂ But I didn™t 
know then. 
Q:  Was he your first boyfriend, in some  way? 
A:  Yes, first love.  

Q:  And you do consider him a first love? 

A:  Yes, because  I cared. It was not Œ it was not 
like being madly in love. It was more like being 
loved by some body who cared, bu
t not having to be alone. 
Q:  But you were a very innocent young woma n?  

A:  Yes. 

Q:  Did you nevertheless see that there we re 
a lot of affairs going on Œ that people were 
coupling? 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  Did you think of that as be
ing a kind of desperation, that people thought they mi ght die? 
A:  No, it wasn™t out of desperation. It was Œ it wa
s like in any society wh
ere people live in close 
proximity that these connections are made. The 
director of the corset factory and another 
factory, they had a 
ménage-a-trois
, and it was common knowledge 
in the ghetto. They lived 
in one room, in one bed, everybody laughed. It wa
sn™t funny. It was actually sad. Dora Fuchs 
was ma dly in love with the Auday Yakobov
itch (ph). Yakobovitch was ma rried. There are 

hundreds of these stories. Some  
were true love stories. Some
 survived the war and lasted 
long beyond the war, and some  brok
e up with the end of the war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417

Q:  Were wome n Œ if you knew this at the time and ma ybe you c a n only know this on refl ection 
Œ were women in some  sense in a more vulnerable position because more me n had jobs and 
more me n were in a positi
on to give wome n things? 
A:  No. 

Q:  No?  

A:  No. It varied from case to case. It depended on the individual. If a ma n was in a powerful 
position, yes. He had the power and the clout 
to dema nd, but so did the wome n in powerful 
positions. It  worked both ways. They™d pick the ma n that they wanted. 
Q:  And there were a lot of wo
me n in power, as far as you know? 
A:  As far as I know, in the ghetto for the firs
t time, women wer e not onl
y nurses or teacher or 
home ma kers, there was a woma n a year older 
than I who ran the ma ttress factory, and she 
had her pick of the crop, as you would say. Ther
e was Dora Fuchs, for instance. There was 
Val Kovner (ph). There were ma ny, ma ny, and t hese wome n were very capable. They were 
powerful. They were very smart, very 
intelligent, but very tough, very tough.  
Q:  And you knew all this when you were there? 
A:  I lear ned all this- 

Q:  Later? 

A:  Slowly. 

Q:  Slowly. 

A:  Slowly, ™42 Œ ™43 Œ ™44.  

Q:  Was this shocking to you? 

A:  Yes.  

Q:  Why?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
80 
 
 
A:  Because I had no idea. I had a read so me  tran
slated French literature that was risqué, but I 
really did not know what to ma ke of i t . If the 
director of the evening kitchen had an affair 
with a police Œ with a Jewish po
lice, kept in only on the dini
ng table in the kitchen, and it 
was common knowledge in plain view, it was shocking beyond words.  
Q:  Did you ever see anything that 
was shocking to you in that regard? 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  You did? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  So, you saw things Œ people ac
tually coupling in public places. 
A:  Yes, yes, public pl aces. There was a woma
n in charge of the recovery home  where you 
would be sent for two weeks if you were a dese
rving worker, but you had to be of fairly high 
rank, and it was out in Marysin, 
and Spiegel we re walking, and 
she came  over. She was twice 
my age, ma ybe more, and she ma de  an open proposition. 
Q:  To him?  

A:  Yes, while I stood there like 
the fool that I was, and he sa
id, ﬁLet us stand here. You can 
come  back later,ﬂ but he didn™t.
 So, all this was very shocking. 
Q:  I could imagine. 

A:  And then towards the end, 
after the evening kitchen, Spiege
l just stopped picking me  up. I 
asked him why. He didn™t answer. He mi ght ha
ve gone back to his wife. He mi ght have 
stayed with his parents, but 
we never spoke again. In January
 ™44, I was on a deportation list, 
and my friend Elie went to him to get me  off 
the list. He went to talk Podlowski (ph), who 

had influence, and my na me  was deleted, but 
I never saw not until 1963, when he picked us 
up at the airplane. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
81 
 
 
Q:  You and your husband? 
A:  And my two children. 

Q:  And your two children. 

A:  In Tel Aviv. 

Q:  So, when Neftalin sends you to Oskar Singer,
 you still see Spiegel 
throughout that whole– 
A:  He picks me  up every evening. 

Q:  So, tell me  about working Œ where you glad to go? 

A:  No, I was heartbroken. 

Q:  You wanted to stay in that office? 

A:  Yes. I have no interest in 
statistics. I had no interest Œ I 
had no knowledge even that this 
office was of any import a nce or prestige. I did not
 particularly wanted to work for a Czech. It 
was a very stuffy office with very few e mploy
ees and everybody was at least 50 or 45. I was 
mi serable, but it was not something that I co
uld question or refuse. It would have been 
dangerous. 
Q:  And why would you have thought
 that Neftalin sent you there 
in order to get you away from 
Rumkowski, since Rumk owski could go anywhere? 
A:  He mi ght have also wanted to get me  away
 from Spiegel. He mi ght have. I will never know 
because he was killed in Auschwitz. I would 
have  asked him. I don™t know, because he knew 
his former wife. 
Q:  I see. So, that
™s quite possible. 

A:  It is possibl e. I will ne ver know. It could be one of two reasons.  

Q:  What kind of a person was Singer?  Di d you get to know hi m?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
82 
 
 
A:  Yes. Singer spent his day ma inly on the street, or away from the office seeing people who 
had some  knowledge, who had some  influenced, 
who had important jobs. I would pick up at 
the bottom of the bridge in the police station fr
om Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics Œ so 
many people died, so many people co mmitted suic
ide, so ma ny were deported. When Singer 
came back into the office, he would write or have
 us take notes and eventually, he produced a 
tremendous amount of material, b
ecause the chronicle of
 the large ghetto is not all Singer™s. I 
think several hundred pages at l
east, and that™s a forthcomin
g book now. He was a journalist. 
He had worked as a journalist in Prague. He
 had a tremendous insight, and norma lly, I was 
able to understand his writing except for one tw
o-page Œ I couldn™t even
 call it a report. It  
was more like a love letter to Rumk owski. If  you want to read the German version, I can get 
it for you. It™s available in Lodz and at the 
University in Giesse
n. It does not fit his 
personality. It does not fit his othe r reports. It
 does not fit the ma n because he very well knew 
and realized that, on some  level, Rumkowski 
was collaborating. He followed orders. Whether 
he followed orders because he really believe
d it would buy us life or time, or whether he 
didn™t have the courage to do anything else, 
because he ma de it very clear any kind of 
resistance would not be apprecia
ted is a mild word, would not be
 tolerated. So, this last entry 
to Rumkows ki could have only meant that he to
ok it there and got some  s ort of a reward, 
which meant additional food, a loaf of bread, 
whatever. His daughter was my age and I me t 
her through him, and his son was two or three ye
ars older, and he cult
ivated the girls whose 
father belonged to the police and to other im
portant ghetto institutions. He worked in the 
bakery as an electrician. Stra
ngely enough, Dr. Singer, a very educated ma n and so was his 
wife, did not send either one of his kids to coll
ege, and he could have because Prague was not 
Germany. Whether they would not have been 
college ma terial, I really cannot judge. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
83 
 
 
both had trades. The daughter was a seamstress 
and the son an electrician. The wife came 
from a German-speaking fa mily in Prague, a ve
ry bright, very nice woman. His sister was in 
the ghetto. Her husband had been
 arrested after Prague was 
occupied, and one did not know 
his whereabouts, and she had a longstanding, ongoing connection with the director of the 
electrical component f
actory. And then there were two el
derly ladies living in the same  
household. They had almost a small apartment 
on Zgierska St reet. It was very clean and 
when I could not keep my bread for eight or 
nine days, I™d give it to my  friend, and she 
would bring me  a portion to work everyday. So, I 
trusted her with my bread. What else can I 
say of the Singer?  The two old ladies, especial
ly one of them, was his landlady Roztoky, near 
Prague. No children, very wealthy. 
I think the husband died or was 
killed Œ or he died in the 
ghetto. In the ghetto, these two ladies ma de out
 a last will and testament in favor of Dr. 
Singer. I was, about six years a
go, at Sonoma  State University, 
and the director of Holocaust 

Studies is John Steiner. John is only very par
tly Jewish, but he ma de it through Auschwitz in 
spite of the fact that he never knew he was a Je
w. It turns out that one of the ladies living 
with Dr. Singer was his aunt. 
He knew Dr. Singer before the 
war, and his daughter was his 
girlfriend. So, I told him the story about the will,
 and he™s now Œ I mean, the will was lost in 
Auschwitz Œ he™s trying to regain the house n
ear pa rk, and there was also a bank account by 
the same  aunt in Switzerland, but the name  a
nd the numbers have never appeared. So, after 
50 years, to come  across this little old lady ag
ain is very strange. I found it in a way strange 
only it was resourceful that Dr. Si
nger asked the two ladies to 
ma ke out their last will. On 
some level, he must have thought that he w
ould survive the war, because otherwise, why 

would you do it?  His son had, at time s, a radio. 
It was in poor shape, 
it needed constant 
repair. We  o nly got the BBC and the progres
s of the war Œ nothing about Wa rsaw, nothing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
84 
 
 
about our ghetto, nothing about Auschwitz, 
no idea. No me ntion was ever ma de by Dr. 
Singer of a place like Auschwitz, like Bergen-B
elsen. No me ntion was made by Neftalin, by 
Spiegel. It just was not me ntioned. So, it can 
be assume d that we really didn™t know. Maybe 
some body knew, but I don™t know. 
Q:  And nobody me ntioned Ha mburg? 
A:  No, that you saw from the letter which I 
got in ™47 where it stated
 they were killed in 
Auschwitz, and it turned out they
 were killed in Ha mburg. So, th
at is mu ch later information. 
The work for Dr. Singer was effortless. It wa
s boring. It was dull. I was a clerk. It was a 
large, dark offi ce, and it was terribly lonel
y, whereas the pr evious offi ce had people. Until 
one day when I got a phone call, would I pleas
e appear in police h
eadquarters outside the 
Balutski Renneck (ph), and there was Rumkows ki,
 and he told me  that I would work in the 
evening kitchen together with 40 other young wome
n my age who had been for six months in 
the wome n™ s police corps, and they wore uni
forms just like the men. They were mostly 
young women who had finished 
matura
 (ph) either before they ghetto or in the ghetto in ™40, 

and they strutted around the ghetto in their polic
e uniforms, gray with an orange band, and it 
was a police corps that lasted
 probably eight months.  
Q:  In 1943? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  I™m looking surprised. 

A:  Yes, I™m surprised that you™re 
surprised. I thought it was common knowledge. 
Q:  Well, ma ybe  for some , but has not been for me . 

A:  Well, there are some of these wome n still alive. 

Q:  Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
85 
 
 
A:  Yeah, and all of these went to work in the 
Kuechenuhr kueletini
 (ph) evening kitchen, which 
was used for a two-week period for deserv
ing workers on a coupon which gave them an 
evening meal, a little vegetables, sometimes a 
little starch, and some thing that looked like a 
hamburger, but it was round. What it contained, I 
really couldn™t say. I ripped mi ne up and I 
gave it to Spiegel when he picked me  up. Ru
mkowski knew about Spiegel and he threatened. 
Q:  Threatened you or threatened Spiegel? 
A:  Threatened me  for seeing him. He told me
 that he knew. Wh o had carried the information, I 
don™t know, but it was common in the ghetto to
 trade information, to talk to the 
admi nistration about anything or 
to denounce people, to no partic
ular gain other than ma ybe 
you got a little reward for it,
 but just to carry gossip. Th
e young policewomen were all 
waitresses. 
Q:  Let me  stop you for a mi nute. Is this 
the time  when Spiegel stops seeing you? 
A:  No, that was before Œ af
ter that, he stopped seeing me . 
Q:  After he stopped seeing you? 

A:  End of ™43. 

Q:  So, perhaps he stopped because he 
wa s frightened, or you didn™t tell hi m?  
A:  I didn™t tell him.  

Q:  Is it possibl e that Rumkowski went to Spiegel and said, ﬁStopﬂ? 

A:  Anything is possible. I d
oubt it, but it is possible. 
Q:  And, how did you Œ that™s a question you can™t 
answer. All of these wome n who were in the 
wome n™s police who came  in and you™re the only 
one who™s in another Œ was in another job? 
A:  I was in the office. 

Q:  Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
86 
 
 
A:  If we receive d 50 kilo of carrots, and we had to serve 400 meals, how mu ch did each person 
get in terms of weight?  So many grams, and I 
had a little trouble with the arithmetic. They 
kitchen was run by a ma n of the name of Minsk. 
He was sort of grandf
atherly and kind, and 
he ran the kitchen. He was the Œ 
there were four of them. He ra
n this particular one, and he 
brought in a young ma n who helped me  with th
e figuring. I couldn™t ma nage it. I could 

ma nage it now. But in the afternoons, he wa
s ordered to leave because this was done 
clandestine. Rumkowski did not 
know, or if he knew, he did not let on, but I was a clerk for 
that kitchen. 
Q:  All right, I want to go back
 to being in Singer™s office for 
a mi nute. Did you learn anything?  I 
understand it was boring, but you didn™t 
have colleagues on a regular basis. 
A:  No. 

Q:  But did you learn things about
 the ghetto from being in that
 office that you would not have 
known otherwise or that you di
d not know before about how 
things were operating? 
A:  Yes. You found out if a factory changed 
ma nage me nt. You found if somebody was replaced 
by some body else. You found out if people were 
in the ghetto yesterday. You heard a rumor, 

true or untrue, that Biebow tried to rape 
Dora Fuchs. You heard Œ you heard all sorts of 
rumors in that office, some of which you di
dn™t dare put down on paper because there was 
always the chance of censorship by the German
s, and censorship by the Jews. There were 
some ti me s stories about food rations to be and 
they never ma terialized or vice versa. The 
information was accurate to the extent that you 
couldn™t substantiate very much. I me an, even 
when I picked up the daily statistics, so ma ny di
ed in the hospital, so ma ny jumped out of a 
window, of course, no births Œ ther
e were hardly any births, even
 these statistics they were 
kept, but the question arises 
how accurate where they. There 
were quite a few suicides 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417

especially from Œ commi tted by people comi ng 
from the west Œ some  were doctors, some 
were lawyers, and they must have brought so
me thing along to ma ke suicide possible. There 
was a rumor  that the ghetto had some  docto
rs. There was a lady by 
the name  of Krona n 
Burke (ph). There was Dr. Miller, who was Ru
mk owski™s favorite doctor, but no me dication. 
There was a lady dentist who opera
ted a drill with a foot pedal, like an old fashioned sewing 
machine, and you heard about them. You heard, fo
r instance, that if you 
were jaundiced or if 
you had hepatitis, atropine would help, an injecti
on of atropine. Whether this is true today, I 
do not know. Atropine could be somehow s muggle
d into the ghetto if 
you knew a German of 
the guard. These things you heard in the o
ffice, but you could never vouch for honesty or 
credibility.  
Q:  And did Singer write down mo
re than ever went into the 
Chronicle
? He had ma ny more Œ 
because I™m sure when he  went out to talk wi
th the people, he  must have taken down notes.  
A:  He took very brief notes, but then- 
Q:  He would write– 
A:  Then it got– They™re all typewritten on an
 old-fashioned manual typewriter. They have 
some  errors. All of his entries will be out inJanuary in German, and if
 you™d like it, I™ll get it 
for you. His counterpart was Oskar 
Rosenfeld, also from Prague, 
and his Œ he had not nearly 
as ma ny entries. He was much older. He had 
a very young wife in England and he was very 
grandfatherly, very sweet, very
 ki nd Œ a totally different style because when I was at the 
Justice Liebzig University, they gave  me  a stack of these reportages and they asked me to 

identify them and said, ﬁHere is Singer™s.ﬂ A
nd I went through them. I said, ﬁNo, this is not 
Singer. This is Oskar Rosenfeld.ﬂ And it was co
rrect Œ totally different
 style. I didn™t know 
him as well as Singer because he worked in 
the office, but I didn™t work for him. His book 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
88 
 
 
supposedly was just published in English by 
Hanna Levy, either Frankfurt at the Bauer 
Institute in Fr ankfurt, or it came out in Be
rlin. I™m not sure whic
h. And Hanna Levy did the 
editing and it supposedly came out in English. I ha ve not seen it. And I™m not as familiar 
with his entries. 
Q:  So, you didn™t type these reports? 

A:  Some  I did type wherever there was a typewr
iter available, but there was only one and I was 
not the only one who had access to it. 
Q:  So, when you say you were clerking, what would that mean? 

A:  I would transcribe some  of
 Singer™s notes in longhand. I woul
d file things. I 
would give him 
the daily statistics. I would do very me nial wo
rk Œ nothing of any consequence or substance, 
but I did read what he wrote becau
se it was an interesting style. 
Q:  So, you weren™t completely, given the kind 
of job you were doing, you were not completely 
unhappy going to the kitchen. 
A:  No, because it meant an extra meal. It was from five to seven in the evening. People lined up 
and had a coupon, and, well, Rumk owski came almo
st every evening, and the apron of the 
waitress, if the bow in the back
 was not straight, he
 would hit her with a cane. He carried a 
cane. He threatened a couple of 
them with dismissal. In the fr
ont sat two ladies who clipped 
the coupon which had to be counted every 
morning Œ two ladies?  Two young wome n. The 
cooking was done by a couple of lady chefs. 
Q:  Let™s hold here. We  have to change the tape.

Tape 5 
 
Q:  Lucille, we™ll talking ab
out the kitchen, and you were me n
tioning, before we were talking 
about the actual cooking, there were people at
 the Œ wome n at the door clipping coupons. 
Where did people get the coupons? 
A:  You got them in the factory, you got them
 in an office, if your boss decided that you 
deserved a bonus. And of course it wa s Œ th
ere were never enough coupons to go around the 
ghetto, but it was an incentive or  a gift  fo
r some of them. There 
was a lot of fa voritism 
involved as to who got them. I f you were we
ll connected, you could be sure to get the 
coupon. It wa s Œ it was an original idea to reward 
a worker because it wa
s said the straw shoe 
factory rewarded 12 workers, not bosses, but 12 
workers, or the uniform factory rewarded 10 
workers. It was supposed to be an incentive to 
work hard, to try to top the quota, and in the 
end to please the Germans. 
Q:  One dinner for one coupon? 
A:  Yes, one dinner for one coupon, but you got 
a week at a time . You could come  for seven 
days. So, you got seven coupons. It was one 
coupon and you cut off seven strips. At one 
point, they tried to do it for 
two weeks, and then some body else got a turn. How it was 
decided, admi nistered, as to who got them, or 
which factory Œ that was done behind closed 
doors, I do not know, but there was 
a lot of protection involved. 
Q:  And your job was figuring out the ma thematics of we have this much food and how much for 
each person? 
A:  Well, we had this much food for the wee
k, divide that by seven, 
and then divide by the 
number of clients or  the number of dine
rs who would come , and how mu ch each person 
would consume in gra ms . For instance, it would 
be 50 grams of meat which equals about an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
90 
 
 
ounce. It would be so much red beets, but 
the figuring was complicated. There was no adding 
machine. There was no calculator. I had to ta
ke a pen and pencil and you had to convert the 
kilos to pounds and the pounds to grams, and in Poland they used the word ﬁdecaﬂ which 
meant ten grams. So, it was a little overwhelmi ng 
for me . I mean, I was n™t bad at math, but I 
wasn™t that good. 
Q:  And who de cided what the me nu would be? 

A:  That depended Œ well, the Œ Mr. Mintzer was 
in charge of the kitche
n, and it depended on the 
supply. They would Œ they would send Œ they would come  on a horse-drawn truck, sort of 

like a flatbed truck but horse-drawn, and they w
ould either unload or sack or a crate or 
sometimes it was fl our, sometimes it was carrots or
 beets or turnips, very rarely potatoes, 
someti mes meat, and fr om the looks of it, it wa
s horsemeat because it was very dark red, and 
it was all served on one plate, in little porti
ons, and the portions were pretty much equal, 

almost if you would take an ice cream scoop. We 
were entitled the same  me al an hour before 
our guests would appear with the rule that no
thing was supposed to be taken out, but we did 
anyway. 
Q:  And how many people per evening usually? 

A:  Well, the so-called dini ng room
 was filled up. I would say probably 200. 
Q:  That™s a lot of people. 

A:  150-200, but not for a ghetto of 160,000 people. 

Q:  Was there a large kitchen, or wa s it a very ma keshift kind of thing? 

A:  No, it was a large kitchen. It
 had big kettles. The cooks were
 ladies, and they were standing 
on a platform stirring ferociously at those kettl
es, and we would come  in and look and they 
didn™t like it, and in the back of
 the kitchen was a storage room
, and the storage room had the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
91 
 
 
supply. The young woman who ran the storage room was some what older than we were, I 
guess, close to 30. Her name  was Meyerowitz, an
d she carried the key 
to the storage room 
around her neck, and you were not allowed to go 
over the threshold into
 that storage room. 
She would reach Œ she would weigh, count, what
ever, and she would reach the food out, and 

I was a little friendly with her, and if I woul
d come near the entrance she would say, ﬁStop, 
stand there and talk to me. Don™t go further.
ﬂ Because I mi ght touch some thing or take 
some thing. She was very me ticul
ous for reasons of her own. 
Q:  And were you also the youngest
 person working in the kitchen? 
A:  No, there were two or three 
people younger than I. Most were
 older than I, but there was a 
young woman that Œ three young wome n who we
re younger than I am, but not by much. 
Q:  Rumkowski came in every night Œ to eat? 

A:  Al most every Œ no. No, he had decent food. 
I mean, if you look at his prewar picture Œ his 
rumpled shirt, his rumpled pants, his dishevel
ed hair Œ he was a poor ma n. When he showed 
up in the ghetto, he was pressed and tailore
d, immaculate Œ boots, he wore boots Œ SS-type 
boots Œ shined. Lodz had very good ta
ilors. I think the best in a
ll of Poland. His top coats, his 
jackets were out of Fifth Ave
nue Œ unbelievable, elegant.  
Q:  So, he come s in and he™s sort of a mo nster to people. 

A:  Well, he come s in Œ he was very pr
oud of his achieveme nt, and I guess it was an 
achieveme nt, but the people Œ the young people 
who worked for him were petrified of hi m 
because he would beat them and if he was disp
leased, he would dismiss them, and that was a 
risk you took. A couple of girls I knew were
 dismissed. One  of them ma naged through 
connections to come  back. It was a good 
job, but it was a risky job in some  ways. 
Q:  Were you frightened of him?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
92 
 
 
A:  Yes, I was. I was. 
Q:  Were you frightened based on what 
you saw or what you had been hearing? 
A:  Both. 

Q:  Both? 

A:  Both. 

Q:  Now, I™ m a little confused about time fra m
e when it come s to the various conversations you 
had with people about Ru mkowski. Spiegel says th
ings to you Œ that he™s a pig or a pest, and 
that one has to be careful of hi m. You m
eet other people Shlomo
 (ph), Branya, Luba. 
A:  Branya I me t while I worked for Spiegel.
 She came  into the office as a courier. 
Q:  Okay. 

A:  Luba worked in the Statistical Departme nt. 

Q:  When you working with Singer? 

A:  Right. The woma n who worked at the orphanage , the teacher. 
Q:  Dorka? 
A:  Dorka, she lived in our building. She was an unmarried woma n and she was deported 
together with my sister 
to Chelmo. Yulik (ph), I me
t after the war in Paris. 
Q:  And Shlomo , when did you meet Shlomo 
Œ Shlomo Hect (ph), he has the pushcart. 

A:  Oh, I me t him at the very beginning, 
when I come into the ghetto in ™41. 
Q:  So, right in the beginning you hear stories because he tells you- 

A:  Right. 

Q:  -about Sergei- 

A:  Right, who was his friend. 

Q:  -who was his friend, and was investigating Rumkowski. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
93 
 
 
A:  Shlomo be fore the war had a store that sold
 yarns and fabrics and things like that. He  had 
pushcart on corner Rybna and Lutomierska St reet
 and it sold Œ he sold
 needles and thread 
and other small items. I think he was an educat
ed ma n because he spoke German. He talked 
to my mother in the very beginning, and he talk
ed to me  Œ as long as he lived and he died 
shortly after my mother Œ he talked to me in
 bits and pieces. On the outsi de, on the street 
corner, when the weather permitted. When it got
 very cold and I could spare the time, I 
would drop in at his room. He ha
d a daughter about my age, a y
ear older, and he would talk. 
He lived on, I think, Narutoviska (ph) Street 
before the war as did Sergei. Sergei was a 
bachelor until quite late, and he worked for th
e city council in Lodz. He was a short man. He 
was heavyset. 
Q:  This is Sergei? 

A:  Yes. I me t him only after the war, and he ha
d a brother. I never me t him. He perished. And 
he was a friend of Shlomo™s, and he heard th
e story about the complaints. He tried to 
investigate. The first time the accusations were
 thrown out for lack of
 evidence by the Jewish 
Council. The second time was just before the start of the war. Supposedly, the complaint was 

filed. Rumk owski knew about it. Sergei escape
d to Russia to Œ through Russia, I think he 
went to Yugahama  (ph), then to Canada, then
 to Los Angeles. I me t hi m in 1975. Rumkowski 
looked for him all through the war. He thought he
 was hiding in the ghetto. Sergei eventually 
went back to school and became a social wo
rker, but while he was working on the city 
council, he worked in the Balut. He knew the 
thieves. He knew the thief in charge. He knew 
the underworld, and when his silver watch wa
s stolen, he complained and it reappeared. 
There was a young woman in the ghetto. She also
 worked in the kitchen, and she once took 
me  home, and I me t her mother Œ a tall, well-dre
ssed woma n, heavyset, and the father is sort 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
94 
 
 
of s mall and shifty-eyed gentlema n, and he aske
d me where I come from
 a nd what my father 
did, and his only answer was, ﬁF
ehﬂ I didn™t know what to ma ke of it. The apartment in the 
Balut had all the prewar furniture, rugs, glassw
are, crystal, and it tu
rned out he had lived 
there before the war with his family as had 
my co-worker from the kitchen. She was very 
pretty, very blonde. I don™t thi
nk she could count to five, but 
she was very popular. She had a 
couple of sisters, a brother-in-law, and when I 
asked the father, since he had such contempt 
for my fa ther™s work, what did he do before the 
wa r, he said, ﬁA little of this, and a little of 
that.ﬂ But the rumor in the ghetto was that 
he had an older daughter
 and the daughter was 
sold to a brothel in South America. And 
it was common knowledge. But he had underworld 

connection before the wa r; during the war,
 I don™t know. His children survived. What 
happened to the daughter in South America, I 
do not know. He and his wife did not survive. 
His daughter is still living.  
Q:  How does it come  that Shlomo tells you about
 Sergei™s investigati
on of Rumkowski?  Is it 
just because Rumkowski is part
 of a lot of conversation? 
A:  Yes, yes, because he used to drive by in
 this horse-drawn buggy. Ev
erything was signed with 
Rumkowski ™ s name  from the mone y, to the announcements, to everything else. He was 

envied, envied partly for power, ma i nly for 
food. I mean, it™s almost like saying, ﬁWhy was 

Kennedy talked about? ﬂ  It was a person who wi
elded enormo us power, and who did not live 
the life of the average ghetto dwel
ler. He lived a di fferent life.  
Q:  So, Shlomo tells you about four children 
or three children?  He  
tells you about Branya. 
A:  He me ntions the four children. 

Q:  Including Branya and Dorka.  

A:  Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
95 
 
 
Q:  So, you have a sense of what Rumk owski wa
s doing in an orphanage to little children- 
A:  Well- 
Q:  Or not?  

A:  No, I didn™t have a sense. I had never heard of 
such a thing, and it didn™t 
Œ it didn™t really fall 
into place.  
Q:  But, he tells you he takes child
ren into a room and undresses them. 
A:  Yeah, or mo lests them. 

Q:  Or molests them in some  way. 

A:  And Œ but, to me , I me a n I was 16 years old. 

Q:  So, it™s just a story. 

A:  It™s just a story, and I must
 have found it frightening but I coul
d not Œ I could not really relate 
to it. 
Q:  When you meet Branya, who was the first pers
on who actually experiences this and is still 
experiencing it in the ghetto- 
A:  Right, and she cried and she couldn™t talk. 
She started a sentence and never finished it. 
Q:  So, you never found out from her, as 
much a story as you heard from Shlomo? 
A:  No. I found out bits and pieces
. I found out that he r food ration was considerably be tter than 
mi ne. She was a very - well, she gave the 
appearance of a very happy person, but she was 
very, very unhappy because her family used 
her, and she had a mi serable childhood, and she 
had a mi serable ghetto life. 
Q:  And then Dorka, who tells you 
about this little
 child, Manya. 
A:  The child with a violin. 

Q:  Who he mol e sts- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
96 
 
 
A:  Yeah. 
Q:  And she runs away fearful. 

A:  She runs away and she hits the barbed wire
 and gets shot, but it wa
s never publicized. It was 
never spoken about. Nobody dared because there we
re ma ny killings along the barbed wire. 
That was very, very common. Luba was much 
more outspoken. She was very worldly, very 

wise. She was an orphan from a very young age. 
The man with whom she 
lived used to run a 
food distribution center and he was caught st
ealing, and he ended in prison, and she had 
Rumkowski release him under the conditi
on that he would not get a job.  
Q:  And then she continues in some  way going to Rumkowski. 

A:  Yes, she got- 

Q:  But she was in the orphanage before the war. 

A:  Oh, yes. 

Q:  So, she was molested as a child and then 
as adult woman she agrees
 to do it in or der to 
protect this- 
A:  This ma n and to get food, and she got a 
beautiful apartment out near Marysin with the 
promise that she would get ma rried and th
at Rumkowski would perform the ceremony, and 
she always postponed it. She postponed it thr
ee or four times. I don™t know why, whe t her he 
didn™t want to get ma rried or she didn™t
 want to get ma rried. I never found out.  
Q:  Did he know what she was doing
?  Her Œ the man she was living with? 
A:  I don™t know. 

Q:  You don™t know. 

A:  I never knew hi m well enough to have a conve
rsation with him. We said, ﬁHelloﬂ and ﬁHow 
are you?ﬂ and small talk
 but we never talked. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
97 
 
 
Q:  Now, you meet Luba in ™43-‚44 
A:  ™43. 

Q:  You™re a little older now. Do you now 
begin to understand what he™s doing? 
A:  No, what I understood is that Luba had to 
have an abortion. That she was living with her 
boyfriend. That I understood. I knew that Luba wa
s really wise and very worldly and she 
played the game  by her own rules. How much 
I  related to it, or 
how much I understood, I 
don™t know. 
Q:  You liked her? 

A:  Yes, because she was very friendly, very boi
sterous, very outgoing, and very attractive, but 
not pretty. She was short. She was plump. She 
managed to buy clothi ng from recent arrivals 

because she had the means to purchase. I liked 
her. There was Œ there was a charm about her. 
There was a will to live. She could be a lot 
of fun. She could laugh about anything and there 
was really not much to laugh about. But I liked her. 
Q:  Did she work in the kitchen also? 

A:  Yes, she clipped coupons. 

Q:  I see. So, you and she 
moved into that position- 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  -from the Singer job, as well. 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  I see. So, are you Œ I don™t know if it™sunconsciously nervous about Rumkowski because he 
in some  sense pointed you out to 
hims elf, ﬁI will see you again.ﬂ 
A:  Yes. It ma de me  nervous. On the other ha
nd, I thought ma ybe I will ge
t more to eat, in an 
innocent sort of way Œ maybe some body 
will be kind and give me more food. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
98 
 
 
Q:  So, you are a still in an innocent way. 
A:  The strings Œ the strings I 
didn™t attach at 
that point.  
Q:  So, then what happens? 

A:  Well, he came  into the office. One of the fi
rst proposals were that he would rent Œ he would 
rent! Œ he would get a room above the kitchen so
 he can come  anytime, and I started to cry 
and I said, ﬁI want to stay where I amﬂ, et ceter
a. He got angry and he beat me  with his cane. 
He came ba ck in subsequent weeks and months
 and it was a matter of molestation. The man 
was impotent, but he did not like to know that
 or hear about it, and to me  it was utterly 
frightening because at one point I wasn™t ev
en quite sure how you become  pregnant until 
Luba told me.  
Q:  Did he undress you? 

A:  No.  

Q:  So, he didn™t - 
A:  It was just a ma tter of touching. 
Q:  Touching him?  

A:  Yes, and it was disgusting. The fear was trem
endous. Not only the fear 
of the beating, but the 
fear of his power. The fear that he could decideover life and death, that he could deport, that 

he could denounce to the Germans, t hat he 
could do just about anything. That fear was 

overwhelming. He wanted to know about my fa
mily. He wa nted to know who was living in 
Palestine. He  wanted to know if they were well
-off. He made me promis
e that after the war I 
would see to it that th
ey would help him, both to get to
 Palestine and to give him money 
because I owed him that. And he made one remark
 that struck me  then, it strike s me  now. ﬁIf 
I can save a hundred huma n beings, 
it will have been worthwhile.ﬂ 
I tried to figure out the ‚it™ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
99 
 
 
in the sentence. He spoke Yiddish. What would 
have been worthwhile? The death of so ma ny 
others, the collaboration, the 
cooperation with the Germans, 
a hundred huma n beings out of 
150,000?  It Œ it shocked me . That 
and the children, ﬁGive me  your
 children.ﬂ Those rema rks 
I could neither forget nor forgive.  
Q:  When he beat you the first time , he never beat you again? 
A:  No, he beat me  several time s. 

Q:  He beat you several time s? 

A:  With a stick, over the shoul
der, over the head. He was not as
 steady on his feet as a norma l 
65 year old, ma inly because he probably wore th
ose crazy boots and it wasn™t easy to walk 

with boots up to your knees. You just know that
 when he was displeased he would beat 
people. Whe t her those were the gi
rls in the kitchen or anybody el
se, it really di
dn™t ma tter. If 
you were lucky, you flinched and 
you hoped there were no furthe
r consequences. But he was 
every bit as frightening as an SS Œ I f
ound out later Œ as an SS man in unifor m. 
Q:  He locked the door- 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  -to the office when he came . 

A:  Yes, absolutely. 

Q:  Did you scream when he hit you? 

A:  No. 

Q:  You didn™t cry? 

A:  No. 

Q:  Why?  

A:  I cried. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
100 
 
 
Q:  You cried. 
A:  I cried. You didn™t hear a sound.  

Q:  Did he beat you more when you cried? 

A:  No, he just Œ he vented hi
s anger or his frustration, and if
 I cried, so I cried. That didn™t 
bother him. 
Q:  Did he try to kiss you? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  And he kissed you? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  Yes. Do you have any idea why, when you refu
sed, he said, ﬁYou can™t refuse.ﬂ He wouldn™t 
have said, ﬁYou can™t refuse me . I™m going to
 mo ve you into an apartment.ﬂ Because he 
clearly had the power to do so. 
A:  He had the power to do so. My crying proba
bly stalled for time , or gave me  ti me , and the 
time was the food ran out and the kitchen had to 
be closed, and everybody in that kitchen was 
transferred to the leather f
actory, to the Saddlery. So- 
Q:  So, you don™t know what he would have done? 

A:  No, but there was one woma n about ten years 
older than I who took him up on the offer of a 
room on the other side of the kitchen, but sh
e didn™t care. She was only stupid enough not to 
cover the windows, and she was dumb enough to talk. But she was muc h older Œ much, much 

older, at least ten years older. 
Q:  So, clearly this was happ
ening with a number of wome n- 
A:  Right 

Q:  -in that kitchen. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
101 
 
 
A:  Right. 
Q:  You were not the only one pointed out. 

A:  Yes, he also went into
 the storeroom where the provisi
ons were kept and the door was 
locked. That™s all I know. 
Q:  So, how long were you working in this kitchen. 

A:  I think it lasted about 
three months, four months. 

Q:  And how oft e n did he try to come  and see you? 

A:  Every other day, at least. 

Q:  Really? 

A:  Yeah, because it was hi s accomplishment, his pride and joy, his Œ his child, I mean, this 
brainstorm of having a kitchen for deserving work
ers. I mean, what else could he give them?  
Money didn™t mean a thing. The only thing that 
meant anything was food. So, he came just to 
ma ke sure that everything was running properly, 
because there was a lot 
of theft, there was a 
lot of corruption, there wa s a lo
t of dishonesty, and we all knew. It was unavoidable. It was 
understandable. So, for at least three months, 
he came at least every other day. You never 

knew when he would come . You could hear th
e horse™s hooves outside
, the clicking, and 
then, who else had a horse?  And, then in the ha
llway, you could hear his footsteps because he 
walked very unevenly and very noisily. 
Q:  Approxima tely how ma ny times did he come  to see you in particular?  Do you reme mber how 
many? A few times a week, once a week? 
A:  Oh, it would be at least two or th
ree times a week, at 
least twice a week. 
Q:  Did you talk to Luba about this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
102 
 
 
A:  No. She had an idea because she was much 
s mar ter than I was, and I did ask her about 
pregnancy, and she laughed. She laughed so 
hard, and she said, 
ﬁDon™t you know how you 
get pregnant? ﬂ  And I really didn
™t know, and Œ but, that really 
didn™t change anything. I went 
once to see Dr. Kronenburg, and she looked at me  as
 if I was a little bit 
out of my mi nd, but 
she was kind, and she said, ﬁGo back; don™t worry.ﬂ 
Q:  So, did you explain to th
e doctor what was happening? 
A:  Uh-huh. 
Q:  And she said you don™t have to worry about pregnancy. 

A:  Don™t have to worry, she said, ﬁBesides, you™re not me nstruating. Why ar e you worrying? ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁWhat does that have to 
do with it?ﬂ It was very complicated. 
Q:  Did you me nstruate 
at all during the ghetto? 
A:  Nobody did. 

Q:  Nobody did? 
A:  Nobody did, lack of food. 
Q:  Had you me nstruated before? 

A:  Yeah. 

Q:  Of course, and you just stopped. 

A:  It just stopped.  

Q:  Was she, the doctor, shocked at what you told her about what Rumkowski was doing? 

A:  I don™t think she was shocked. She was an 
older woman who probably 
had children my age. 
She was well-known. She was an MD. She was not a 
felczer
, because the ghetto had a lot of 
doctors that were Œ like, what
 should I say Œ first-aid ma n, or me dical corpsman and they 
were called a 
felczer
, from falsifying the word come s, but
 they were called doctors because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
103 
 
 
there was a scarcity of doct
ors and hospitals otherwise, and she was too smart and too 
intelligent and probably sli
ghtly amused. I don™t know. 
Q:  Amused? 

A:  Yes, that I would be so stupid, a
nd she said, ﬁIt™s all 
right, child, go home.ﬂ 
Q:  So, she didn™t ask you anything abou
t what this was doing to you or what- 
A:  No. 

Q:  - because  this was not relevant? 

A:  No, it wasn™t relevant. You Œ the ghetto 
did not have time, compassion, or patience for 
anyone™s me ntal well-being. That did not exist, 
and didn™t exist during mo
st of the war. It 
didn™t even exist in 1946 in New York. So, th
is is human nature. You just shrug, and you 
figure it out by yourself. 
Q:  And, even Luba laughed because of your thinki ng that you could pregnant from this. 

A:  Yeah. 
Q:  Did she say anything else to you about? 
A:  No. 

Q:  About Rumkowski? 

A:  No. 

Q:  So, you didn™t talk- 

A:  She told me  that she had known hi m si
nce childhood, since the 
orphanage, but their 
relationshi p, their talk was so 
relaxed and so easy, it wasn™t on 
the basis of ﬁSir.ﬂ It was on 
the basis of ﬁyouﬂ, and you don™t call the pr
esident ﬁyou;ﬂ you call 
him ﬁMr. President.ﬂ 
Even in Polish. So, it was fairly obvious th
at there was a connection, somehow, some where. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
104 
 
 
Q:  Did she in so me  sense after all these years,
 gain some  power, now that she was a woma n and 
not a girl, with him?  
A:  Well, the power she gained was the additiona l food, the apartment, those were the obvious 
gains. She ma naged all sorts of strange things. 
She lived in a small room, a small apartment, 
and it was cold and you couldn™t heat it, but you 
could get the element, which is the spiral 
that fits into a heater, for instance, and she 
strung it across the room from r i ght to left, but 
you couldn™t hook it up to me ter because the Germ
ans would have known. So, she got in an 
electrician to hook it up above the me ter, so it 
would not show the numbers on the individual 
room me ters. I mean, she knew things that nobody knew. She knew how to survive.  
Q:  Actually, what I meant was that in so
me  way she had a certain kind of power with 
Rumkowski. 
A:  She didn™t use it. 
Q:  She didn™t use it? 
A:  No, on the contrary, she was very re
laxed and she was very sweet, very smiley. 
Q:  To him?  
A:  Yeah, very outgoing, jovial, joking, 
because in the end, she got a reward. 
Q:  So, when this is happening, that he™s 
forcing you in essence to ma sturbate him.  
A:  Yes. 

Q:  Where are you in your head?  Do you go some where?  Do you leave? 

A:  Fear. 

Q:  You™re in fear. 

A:  Fear, just  fear, cold fear. 

Q:  And it™s the same thing each time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
105 
 
 
A:  Over and over. 
Q:  And it only stops because  the kitchen is closed. 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  You think? 

A:  Yes. Maybe he would have found anothe
r toy, but the kitchen closed on Monday and on 
Tuesday we were working in the Saddlery, all of us.  
Q:  Was that hard work? 

A:  Yes, it was sewing the metal frames that go 
around a shovel that a so
ldier carries on his belt 
to dig a trench, and those 
were sewn on a goat or a 
causa
 (ph), as you say in a Yiddish. That 
means you s it on a bench and in front of you is like a head with a vice, with a wooden vice, 

and you put the leather into Œ th
e two pieces of leather into th
e wooden vice, you have  an awl 
to punch the whole, and then you have a long stri
ng with two needles, one right, one left Œ 
and you sew a double stitch like this, and it wa
s pi ecework. I mean, they counted it, and once 
in a while, there were ten strips to a unit. Once 
in awhile, we were a strip short, and then you 
had to go to the forema n, who was a young ma n our
 age and you had to do a lot of explaining 
and a lot of excusing, and then
 you would get another strip, 
but they were counted out 
carefully because the Germans had shipped them
 carefully. The reason my strips disappeared 
is I stole them. I stole six strips because my s
hoe s had no soles, and I put them in the top of 
my boots, and I walked through the inspection; 
it was like at the airport. They would tap you 
from neck to the bottom. Occas
ionally you had to undress, and I only told about it after I had 
all six out. Nobody knew, and people thought I mu
st have lost my mi nd, but I had no soles 
for the winter. 
Q:  And, then you get some body to fix them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
106 
 
 
A:  I got a shoemaker to sole the shoes, and th
e reason he didn™t talk is because he could keep 
half of the strips, and he coul
d sell them for bread. 
I think it™s about th
e only time I stole. 
That™s why I never bought a pair of boots, never. 
Q:  And you didn™t buy a pair of boots because Œ we
ren™t these boots some thing that were ma de 
for you. 
A:  The boots came from an old hatbox that my 
mother had, and when I had them made, I gave 
half the hatbox to the shoema ker. And in Po
land, there are two shoe ma kers; one who ma kes 
the uppers and one who ma kes the bottom. One 
ma kes the uppers are the kupita (ph), and the 
bottom is the shaftsa (ph), and it™s two pro
cedures. It™s like a desi
gner, designing the upper 
part, and then putting the sole on 
it. And the reason I got them ma de
 was  that I left them have 
the box, half the hatbox because it had a top and a 
bottom. The side were sort of stiff, and Œ 
but they only lasted one winter or ma ybe a 
winter and a half and I came through the soles, 
and I had frostbite, and they were pull up boots in
 sort of a nice brown leather, but much too 
soft for shoes. They were for a hatbox, not 
for shoes. But I had enough room below the knee 
to get a thin item into it like a st
rip of leather, and those I stole. 
Q:  So, why is that you™ve never 
bought a pair of boo
ts since then? 
A:  Because I reme mber those boots. 
Q:  And never wanted another pair of boots? 

A:  No. I couldn™t, because my mother used the 
box for hats before the war. I never bought a pair 
of boots. 
Q:  It™s good you liv
ed in California. 

A:  Probably, but in California th
ere were boots. It™s fashionable. 
Q:  That™s true. So, did these Œ when
 they fixed the boots, it was okay? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
107 
 
 
A:  Yes, but the frostbite rema ined. I saved the to
es, but barely. And once in
 awhile, they lose all 
circulation and they turn greenish-blue. But I ke
pt them. I me a n, I didn™t lose any toes. They 
thawed out. 
Q:  And how long were you work
ing in the leather factory? 
A:  Until deportation out of the ghetto in fall of ™44. 
Q:  And you get there a few months before. 
You worked there a few months or longer? 
A:  Yes, I worked there a few months. 

Q:  And, Rumk owski doesn™t follow you? 

A:  No, never Œ never saw him again. 

Q:  And, do you ever talk to anyone 
else before you l
eave the ghetto? 
A:  No. 

Q:  Does it in some  way leave your mi nd or does it wear on you? 

A:  Nothing. If you went through the war, nothi
ng leaves your mind. It™s 
filed away under Z or 
Y. You don™t think of it every mi nute or ev
ery day, but once in awhile, some thing come s 
back. I was at the airpor t in M
unich in September, and it was 
of course after New York, and 
there the Germans stood in their uniforms and th
eir black boots, and one of them started 
yelling, ﬁYou can™t use this door. Use that door.ﬂ And nor ma lly I don™t understand German, I 

just understand English, and it brought back, ﬁW
hat are you, Gestapo? ﬂ I 
just Œ it just came 
back. I didn™t do it on purpose. There areflashbacks when I™m under stress, but not 

otherwise.  
Q:  And when you wrote the fi
rst part of your autobiography, 
From Ashes to Life
, there™s a hint 
of this Œ what happened with Rumkowski. 
A:  Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
108 
 
 
Q:  Why did it take you a few years mor e  to decide that you would write about this? 
A:  Because it™s difficult to admit this. The 
times have changed. We  hear now of abuse of 
children. We hear now of abuse of
 wives. Twenty years ago, we 
didn™t talk about it. It™s very 
painful to go public with some thing you™re 
not proud of. Wha t  should I have done?  Maybe I 
should have run away. Maybe I should have sl
apped him. I don™t know. Maybe I should have 
done some thing. It™s difficult to say, and that™s 
why I didn™t write it. Th
e other reason I didn™t 
write it is because my mother used to say, 
ﬁIf you can™t say some thing good about a huma n 
being, don™t say it.ﬂ And I agonize
d with that for years.  
Q:  Do you think that in some  ways it helps 
people to understand some thing about Rumkowski 
that they couldn™t understand otherwise? 
A:  I don™t know whether people now really can 
understand our past. I think you have to have 
lived through it to understand 
it emotionally. Intellectually,maybe Œ I can™t expect my  
children to understand th
e past or what it was like. It™s
 not possible. The Holocaust has 
become  a matter of scholarly re
search, of history, 
and it is viewed differently than it is 
viewed by those who were there.It is unavoidable, and it will change more in 20 years when 

we are gone. 
Q:  For me , if I can just say this, in my i
nnocence, I would have thought
 that some one who took 
care of children in an orphanage was a diffe
rent kind of person. Ev
en knowing all I know 
about child abuse, and knowing this ma kes 
it mu ch more understandable how he becomes 
such a dictator within the context of Lodz. 
Because it is a very odd move, it would appear. 
A:  Yeah, but look at the people who work as 
nurses in a hospital and kill people by injection. 
Wouldn™t you expect that 
their training, the intellect Œ after all, they went to college Œ and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
109 
 
 
their me dical knowledge, to do just the opposite. 
And what is it in human nature that ma kes 
us inhuman? I don™t know. 
Q:  Maybe being huma n. 
A:  Maybe.  

Q:  Do people believe you? 

A:  People believe me , except for Germany, wher
e I was told, ﬁWe are having a problem with 
the subject of all the Jewish elders.ﬂ And I 
cannot understand why. As I explained to them, 
politely at first, ﬁIf you had not invaded Pola
nd, if you had not created the ghettos, if you had 
not kept us prison within the ghettos, we w
ould have had no Jewish elders. So, you shouldn™t 
have a problem because these are facts.ﬂ If
 you question the honesty, I can only say, ﬁWere 
you there?ﬂ If you were not there, it™s easy to ta
lk. So, that™s the only 
thing I encountered, in 
Germany, not in this country. 
Q:  Not even with scholars? 
A:  No. 
Q:  They accept what you say. 

A:  They would like to see evidence. They 
know of other quotes in 
other books, of other 
paragraphs. They know of the dismissed complain
t, which happened in the mi d ™30s. It is not 
some thing that appeared out of nowhere. The 
indications were there. The knowledge was 
there, but in the ™30s, for a 
Jewish community to admit some
thing like this is overwhelming. 
You couldn™t do that. The publicity would have 
been devastating, and it wasn™t done. I me an, 
there were a lot of taboos in the ™30s, and lo
ts of things that were never mentioned. 
Q:  I™m trying to figure 
out where to go right now. 

A:  All right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
110 
 
 
Q:  Because it™s late, and I know that you™re
 after the deportation from Lodz , you were a couple 
of weeks in Auschwitz, and then you moved to Ha mburg. 
A:  Dessauer Ufer. 
Q:  Right, to do heavy construction? 

A:  Yes, which was a camp, and out-, a sub-cam
p of Neuengamme, and from there they moved 
us to Sasel, to build temp orary housing for 
the Germans for the bombed out Germans, and 
from there to Bergen-Belsen. 
Q:  And, you were in Bergen-Belsen in ™45? 

A:  Yes, March ™45. 

Q:  So, you™re there for about a month before the British come . 

A:  Just about, and I wouldn™t have ma de it much longer. 

Q:  It was horrible. 

A:  The dead were not buried. The dead were lying on the walkways. Typhus was rampant. The 
dead were not even thrown into the pits. Th
ey we re decaying. People died by the hundreds. 

The Germans did not enter the camp any longer.
 They rema ined on the other side of the 
barbed wire. The camp was guarded from wa
tchtowers by Hungarian Œ by soldiers in 
Hungarian uniforms  who were vicious, who shot
 a great deal, and I th
ink another three to 
four weeks and Bergen-Belsen would have 
been empty. Nobody would have survived. 
Q:  And were you ill by this time? 

A:  I had typhus and just before, and my friend w
ho was killed in Sweden at least gave me some  
water. I had jaundice in the ghetto. I had liver 
problems in the ghetto. I had kidney trouble, 
and a few other little things. 
Q:  So, did you think that it c
ould worse after leaving Lodz? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
111 
 
 
A:  No, I didn™t think so. 
Q:  But it did? 

A:  Yes and no, because Lodz  lasted three full years and the horror was overwhelming. Bergen-
Belsen was as horrible, ma ybe more so, but 
of shorter duration. So, the impact for me was 
the ghetto and not Bergen-Belsen because by Be
rgen-Belsen, you really didn™t care anymore. 

There was not enough energy left to care. 
Q:  When you™re deported from Lodz, do you know 
what™s going on in the war?  Have you heard 
any-?  
A:  No. 

Q:  So, you know nothing. You were so- 

A:  We were in cattle cars and looking through 
the slits above. You had to stand on some body™s 
shoulders. You saw troop trains on adjacent tracks
. You saw other trains with me n in stripe d 
gray and blue uniforms that were shouting so
me thing at us, which you of course could not 
hear. I sat in a corner together with Dr. Singer,
 his sister, his wi fe and his two children. The 
last time I saw him was in Auschwitz. How he 
died in Auschwitz, I™m not sure. Some body in 
Germany claime d he wa s shot. I rather doubt it.
 I think he was very gaunt looking and he 
looked muc h older than his age. I think he just
 we nt to the gas chamber. I spent the whole 
rest of the wa r with his daughter partly with hi
s wi fe. His wife died right after liberation of 
Bergen-Belsen. His sister survived and died in
 London. It™s really imma t e rial how he died. 
He didn™t ma ke it out of Auschwitz. 
Q:  But all during that period, from end of August, September when you arrived in Auschwitz in 
September of ™44 until April of ™45, you were
 not sure what wa s going on Œ who™s winning, 
who™s losing, how it™s going. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
112 
 
 
A:  We heard some  distant air raids in and ar
ound the city of Hamburg, but it was not the ma jor 
attack of ™43. We  heard rumors because adjacent 
to us were some  Italian prisoners of war and 
in Neuengamme were French prisoners of war.
 We heard rumors, but we had heard rumors 
for five years. We  had no idea. 
Q:  I know that we can go on for a few more hour
s, which we will not do now. But what I would 
like to do, and maybe well just ta
ke one more tape Œ ma ybe we™
ll stop now. I™ll tell you what. 
What I think I would like to do because I would like to end this on a very sweet, roma ntic 
note.  
A:  All right. 

Q:  Okay, and what I™d like to do is tell a
bout the story about meeting your husband, which 
ma kes a really wonderful ending, even though there™s so muc h more you can cover. So, let™s 

stop the tape now. 
 
Tape 6 
Q:  I changed my mi nd. We ™re going to go back to
 your deportation from Lodz. I™d like to have 
some  description of that deportation and the trai
n ride as far as you reme mber. Just describe 
it some. 
A:  The deportation was by street. The streets were
 posted which were off limits as part of the 
ghetto. My street was very early on the list. That
 meant if you did not va
cate or if the Jews 
did not vacate that street, the Germans would take
 us out or shoot us. I™m not sure which. So, 
you took whatever you could carry, and you v
acated your rooms or room, and you could 
walk to the other side of the bridge if you 
knew some body t here and stay there for awhile if 
they would let you in, or you coul
d go voluntarily to the railroad
 siding. I started walking and 
I knocked on Luba™s door because she was on the other side. Her boyfriend answered the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
113 
 
 
door. I told him who I was, and he said in Poli
sh and not very politely, 
ﬁGet lost.ﬂ He didn™t 
open the door. I knocked on another door. A friend Œ a coworker who was living with her 
elderly mother and whose boyfriend had died
 Wa rsaw of typhus, probably about 1940, but 
they shared the apartment 
with the captain of the 
Sonder
 police and his wife and I think a 
child, and when I knocked there, the captain from
 the other side of the door told me , ﬁYou 
either leave or...ﬂ. So, I had no c
hoice left but walk, and it wa
s very warm, to the railroad 
siding in Marysin, and there were quite a lot of
 people milling around with 
their little bundles 
or suitcases. I had a little su
itcase and my father™s brief
case, and the briefcase held 
documents Œ papers, passports, whatever. And I 
saw to the left of me  Oskar Singer and his 

fa mily, and they said, ﬁCome on over. We™ll 
go together.ﬂ We  stood there probably for a 
couple of hours in the heat. The Germans put up 
the ramp to the cattle 
car. We  each received 
a piece of bread, a half a loaf
 of bread, some  received a whole bread, and so me  received 
some  sort of a sausage, but we did not Œ nothing 
to drink. We  entered the cattle car, and I sat 
with Oskar™s fa mily in one corner . There were 
the two old ladies, Oskar and his wife, his two 
children, his sister, and I. And, when we asked 
him, ﬁ Where are we going? ﬂ  He shrugged his 
shoulders. He  said, ﬁProbably west for labor.ﬂ 
That was the best guess. The cattle cars were 
closed from the outside, and they mo ved in stops
 and starts because th
ere were other trains 
on the same  siding that were give
n preference. Either they were 
prisoners from other areas or 
they were troop move ments. We  we re never sure
. We  tried to yell over to a different car, but 
of course that doesn™t work. We  sat in these 
hot cattle cars. So me  people cried. Some  people 

fainted. There was a bucket in the corner. Th
e bucket soon overflowed. You couldn™t lie 
down. You could barely sit. And there was re
ally no energy to think, ﬁWhat next? Where 
next? ﬂ  At one point, some body spoke of jumping 
out of the car, but th
e doors never opened. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
114 
 
 
There was no jumping. The next time the door op
ened was four in the morning two days later 
with a concrete platform, brightly lit 
and dogs barking, and SS shouting commands. We 
scrambled out of the car, and we stood. They s
houted orders, ﬁMen to the left. Wo men to the 
right.ﬂ And I stood with the wome n, with the si
ngle wome n. Oskar and his son went to the 
other side. And they were soon ma rched off 
into the distance. We  don™t know where. We 
don™t how they were sepa rated again, because 
at this point there was no separation between 
young and old. We  lined up, and I held the briefcas
e. I held onto that briefcase with the 
papers. Having grown up in Germany, papers
 are very important. And the command was 
shouted, ﬁDrop your belongings.ﬂ Wh ich mean
t a knapsack, a bag, whatever you had, but I 
wouldn™t let go of the briefcase, and an SS wa
lked towards my friend, Dr. Singer™s daughter, 
and towards me  and he s houted again and she 
took the briefcase and to
re it out of my hand, 
and he shouted back, ﬁYou saved yourself a beating.ﬂ 
Q:  So, who tore it out of 
your hand Œ Singer™s daughter? 
A:  His daughter ma de me  drop it. She just tore
 it and dropped it. She probably saved my life. A 
little further down the road, the separated 
the old from the young. In back stood a woma n 
who lived also on Pawia Street, and that™s anot
her story, with a four year old child, a very 
ugly child and I™ve never really 
seen an ugly child. The child wa
s locked up while the parents 
went to work in the daytime. The child whined. The child was hidden behind a chimney 

during the selection, during th
e curfew for hours alone, and 
in Auschwitz, she stood behind 
us. She was ordered to let the child go b
ecause she was probably in her ™30s, and she 
wouldn™t let the child go, and the SS ma n hit th
em between the two hands holding onto each 
other, and they didn™t let go. 
The child screamed terribly, but
 they wouldn™t let go, and his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
115 
 
 
last rema rks were, ﬁYou ma y both go to the ga
s chamber.ﬂ And they were ma rched off with 
the old people. 
Q:  You heard that? 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  And what went through your head? 

A:  Nothing, what™s a gas chamber?   

Q:  It didn™t ma ke any sense. 

A:  No, it didn™t ma ke any sense. By eveni
ng it did, when I saw the smoke and when the 
grapevine carried the words forward. 
Q:  But not then? 

A:  No, and one was so bewildered by this whole 
scene that one didn™t thi
nk. We heard that there 
was a fa mily camp in Auschwitz which we never 
saw. We  heard that there were gypsies. We  
never saw them. We did see Hungarian wome
n. There was a young ma n in a striped uniform 
with an armband ___, red, and he spoke Polish 
to us and he said, ﬁWhere are you from? ﬂ  
And we said, ﬁFrom Lodz.ﬂ And we asked him,
 ﬁWhere are we?ﬂ And he said, ﬁAuschwitz.ﬂ 

And, my friend asked, ﬁWhat™s Auschwitz? ﬂ  He
 said, ﬁYou mean to say you don™t know? ﬂ  
ﬁNo, never heard of it.ﬂ He said, ﬁI™ve been he
re a year and a half, two years.ﬂ He didn™t 
come from Lodz. He came from someplace else. 
He couldn™t understand, but he did ask us 
whether we knew his sister who 
mi ght have been in our transport. And there was a wo ma n 
who recognized a mother who had been there 
a while, and she brought extra food, but that 
was already the next day. From there, theyma rched us those that were fit-looking or not 

elderly or not children anymore,
 into a barracks. We were as
ked to undress, drop all jewelry, 
fold the clothing neatly, and then they took us 
to another barracks and they shaved our hair, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
116 
 
 
and Dr. Singer™s daughter asked, ﬁCouldn™t we ra
ther have a nu mber?ﬂ and, the answer was, 
ﬁHere you take what you get. You don™t ask for anything.ﬂ  
Q:  Where did she get the idea to ask for a number?  Do you know? 

A:  She saw some  wome n kappa 
with numbers who did the actual
 shaving under SS orders. And 
as we were walked out of that
 barracks, the upper half ofthe door was glass and I saw my 
head mi nus hair and two big ears and it looked 
like an egg and I starte
d to cry. It looked so 
horrible that today I™m asking myself, ﬁHow coul
d I have been so stupid and so vain?ﬂ But I 
was. We  we nt into some thing called showers,
 into another barracks, and they were one 
adjacent to the other Œ without shoes, without 
clothing, and by then the gr apevine had said 

some thing about gas and we looked at the 
showerheads and we didn™t know what a gas 
chamber would look like and whether gas would 
come out of these things on the ceiling, and 
the little wetness dribbl ed down, very little, 
and we were pushed forward and we were each 
thrown one piece of clothing, whethe r it was a 
dr ess or a rag or a house robe, one piece, 
nothing else. One woma n in our group was thrown 
a pair of Dutch wooden shoes, the rest of 
us were barefoot. It was hot in Auschwitz Œ 
being called out in the morning, it was freezing 

cold. Being called out in the afternoon, it was so 
hot that the rims of my e a rs were burning, 
my scalp was peeling. That™s how hot it was. We
 were given a slice of bread a day and some  
brown liquid to drink, and in th
e evening there was supposed to be a soup but we were given 
no utensils. So, Alice, who had been in the 
ghetto, who had come  from Vienna, took off her 
wooden clogs and we each took one of them, 
filled them with soup, drank the soup, and 
handed it to the next in line, but we guarded 
the shoes like yo
u would guard Fort Knox. We  
were afraid some body woul
d steal them and run.  
Q:  So, none of you got shoes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
117 
 
 
A:  No, there were close to 500 of us in that 
barracks, and the barracks 
Œ there were no cots. The 
floors were concrete floors and they were di
vided into oblong squares, oblong sections, and 
each section had to have five human beings, but 
there wasn™t room for five. So, at night, we 
would Œ one would sit against the barracks wall,
 spread the legs and the next one would 
move in, until all five of us could sit that wa
y, and in order to sleep, you would lean against 
the neck or the chest of the person in back of
 you. The corner Œ the cen
ter of the barracks had 
a raised platfor m, and the barracks had a coupl
e who had been in Auschwitz quite a while, 
she had hair. She was Jewish by the looks 
of her. I don™t know where she came from 
originally, not from Poland. And she had a cubicle 
in the corner that was sort of parceled off 
Œ it was sort of hidden away with 
a st ring that was attached to the 
right and left of the wall. It 
was a dirty old blanket, and occasionally we™d 
see an SS ma n come  to visit. She screamed a 
lot. She beat us, if we weren™t fast enough. 
I don™t think she killed
 anybody. Her name  was 
Maja. She mi ght have been from Roma nia. I don™t know. She did not come  with us, though 
she told us after a couple of weeks that there wo
uld be an inspection, to 
undress, take off the 
rag. There would be an SS inspection team in the center of the counting area. We  should put 
the dress over the right arm, a
nd wal ked passed the three SS ma n as fast as possible, and one 

of them mot i oned with a stick or a riding whip, 
a leather whip, right left
, right left. We later 
found out that one of them was Dr. Mengele, wh
ich we did not know. We had never heard of 

him, and it had no meaning to us until it was expl
ained probably several years later, or a year 
later.  
Q:  You mean that some one explained to
 you a year later that it was Mengele? 
A:  Yes. No, they said that one of them was 
Dr. Mengele, but we  did not know who he was or 
what he was, and we were given another rag a
nd a pair of random shoes. I got a size eight 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
118 
 
 
shoes; I wear a six. And we were put into catt
le cars, and when they stopped two or three 
days later, I stood on Dr. Singe
r™s daughter™s shoulders and I 
looked out through the little slit 
in the cattle car, and I said, ﬁYou know what?  
We ™re near Hamburg.ﬂ And then she we nt up 
and she looked and she said, ﬁNah, just green
 landscapes; nothing 
Hambur g here. You™ve 
lost your mi nd. It™s been hot too long.ﬂ And th
e cattle car opens up, and we were housed in a 
warehouse of the outer harbor that housed C
zech wome n on the other side. It housed some  
me n from va rious occupied countries, and they
 were all used for forced labor in the 
Deutschebef Blomenforce
 (ph), the defense industry shipya
rds, cleaning up the bomb dama ge 
in and around Ha mburg. And even Dessauer Uf
er was not a concep
t because it was the 
address of a harbor area which to me  had no me
a ning. It was not residential. But when they 

started us by truck or ma inly in
 the subways in a corner, taking
 us to the worksites, and we 
had on these rags and across the rag was a ye
llow painted-on stripe, and underneath the 
fabric was cut out so you couldn™t run away
 Œ no stars, no nothing. Some had a purple 
triangle, but very few. That I realized that 
indeed it was the surroundi
ng of Ha mburg, and for 
a mi nute I thought, ﬁSince I know the area, I c
ould get away.ﬂ But how?  To whom?  Where?  
Food?  And then I realized that this wa s ridicu
lous. So, they then transferred us to another 
camp and in a now very fashionable area in We
del where the mayor of the city lives, and 
there is one of these temporary houses left 
as a me morial, and we were guarded by 42 SS 
me n and wome n. They needed people in the office
 to keep records of the SS personnel and of 
the people in the camp. There was a young lawyer
 from Pola nd, Sophie Kalishinska (ph) and 
I, we spoke German, who got se
nt to the office. We had the 
disadvantage that the commander 
of the camp came from Southern Germany and us ed
 to be a gardener in
 civilian life, was 
vicious. He would come  in and he would kick
 us with his boots. We  had bloody legs and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
119 
 
 
bloody arms , but for a while we didn™t go out to 
work in the rain, but we took a daily beating. 
The SS wome n had no compassion, no understandi
ng. There was no typewriter. Everything 
was written manually with a pencil, not with
 ink. I do not know why. Most of these SS 
people had been drafted late in
 the war; they had been civil service employees before the 
war. For the most part, they were uneducate
d. The wome n we re vicious, some  of the m. The 
me n Œ some  were vicious, some  were not so 
bad. They brought in three wo men from Prague 
to be in charge of the camp, to be kapos
. They couldn™t speak Polish, but they ma naged 
German, and the story of these three wome n is
 another story. They brought in one woma n 
who was tiny, it™s also another st
ory. We couldn™t te
ll how old she was. She probably was in 
her late ™30s, but she ran around 
like a frightened mouse, and 
rumor had it that she was an 
MD by training. She came  from Roma nia, and sh
e was in charge of the hospital room, but 
nobody dared ever use it. It was used once for an
 abortion for a girl w
ho became  pregnant on 
the worksite, and Dr. Gisa and I me t in the la
trines where we would talk a few mi nutes, and 
then she would go her wa y and I would go my way. She had worked for Mengele in 

Auschwitz, and she did the aborti
ons at night so the wome n c
ould live and the babies died. 
Q:  And her name  again? 

A:  Gisa Pearl. 

Q:  Oh, Gisa Pearl. 

A:  Yes, she was in the sa me camp, and there we
re 500 of us. She came to New York, and I saw 
her one more time after the war. I know she 
went to Israel, and Iknow she died. The camp 
was not the worst possible place. One of 
the SS women took the young woman who cleaned 
the SS barracks and me  in a truck to Ha mbur
g to pick-up provisions. We  saw the bombed 
city, and she stopped at a building 
in front of the building that 
used to be upper-middle class 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
120 
 
 
neighborhood apartments Œ wrought iron balconies a
nd a lot of stucco wo
rk, very pretty. And 
she told us curtly to get out of the truck, move
d us towards the entrance, all the way back and 
down into the baseme nt, and she knocked on 
the door and the door opened and it was her 
mother. And the mother apologized for not 
having food, and the young woma n who c l eaned 
the barracks would come  from Lodz with us. Sh
e was very small, very tiny, but very friendly 
and very obliging. She told her 
to lie down on the couch and she covered her up and she gave 
me  a chair to sit on, but not a word was s
poken. We  had an hour of rest and nobody spoke. I 
mean she spoke to her mother, but we didn™t 
speak and she didn™t speak. We went back to 
camp. We didn™t tell, and we coul
dn™t quite figure out what the st
ory was. I think that was the 
only kind gesture on the part of a German that 
I can recall. When they evacuated Sase l and 
put the gypsies there, they took us to Berg
en-Belsen. Except for the overcrowded barracks 
and the dead bodies, I only reme mber two mountai
ns of shoes at the gate, just empty shoes Œ 
old and new and worn, huge mountains, and wh
at crossed my mi nd was, ﬁWhere are the 
feet? ﬂ  But it didn™t ma tter anymore. After Bergen-Belsen was taken 
over by the British, I 
worked as an interpreter and translator. 
Q:  Had you given up in Bergen-Belsen? 

A:  It was hopeless. I mean, we saw the dead bodi
es. We  saw the typhus that was ravaging the Œ 
we only saw the women. We did not see th
e me n. There was no possibility you could live 
another month in Bergen-Belsen, and food wasn™t important anymore Œ not the soup, not the 

bread, nothing. And one day we saw the Germans 
with white bands on their arms  sort of 
tight, white rags. We  couldn™t figure out why, a
nd another few days passed and then on April 
15
th
, the British stumbled upon the camp advancing towards the Elbe River to cut off the 
Russians, and they ma naged, but they found us, as
 well, and they were not prepared for what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
121 
 
 
they found. I worked for them al mos t  from the fi rst day, although I was sick a great deal. I 
had a very good boss. He was a ma jor. 
Q:  How did they found you with the thousands of wome n there? 

A:  In that small group that ma naged to appr
oach the second tank, some body asked, ﬁWhere are 
we?  What is this?  Who speaks English? ﬂ And th
ere were very few people who spoke English 
because, comi ng from Poland, you speak French, not English. So, there we re five or six of us 

that knew. 
Q:  And you we re one of the ones approached? 

A:  I said, ﬁI speak English.ﬂ And we showed
 them around the camp. In the evening he asked, 
ﬁ What can I give you? ﬂ  I said, 
ﬁCigarettes and some biscuits.ﬂ
 And the only thing they could 
find for us to eat were two pound cans of pork 
and lard, and they handed them out, and we 

opened up those cans with stones, with me tal, whatever we could find. We  had no can 

openers. Most of us ate that st
uff. It was half lard and half pork, and probably came from an 
occupied country. By morning, hundreds of 
people were dead, among the m Dr. Singer™s 

wife. His daughter and I ate the 
biscuits and smoked the cigare
ttes. I continued work and I 
didn™t know when to come  to work. I was allowe
d to pick out a watch from the storehouse in 
the camp where they had items sorted by watche
s, rings, pearls, jewe
lry, teeth Œ gold teeth, 
and I picked out a little silver
 watch. The back was rusted. It
 had a black leather band. And I 
wore the watch, and I thought, ﬁIf only some
body would say, ‚You wore my watch,™ﬂ but 

nobody ever did. And a few days later, my boss a s ked, ﬁWhat can I do for you? ﬂ And I said, 

ﬁI would like a shower.ﬂ And he provided se
veral of us with a Red Cross woma n, a little 
piece of soap and a towel. I thought I could wash
 away the past. I coul dn™t. Eventually, we 
were given clean clothing. It 
took about four weeks. The barr
acks had to be burned down in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
122 
 
 
very short notice. They burie
d the dead with a bulldozer. 
The ma ss graves are there, 500,000 
Œ 5,000 Œ I think in all, they buried 10,000 people 
when I was there in September. The terrain 
is immense, the terrain of Bergen-Belsen. I 
would say probably bigger than Birkenau, but 
nothing remains standing because of typhus. I go
t one picture of one barracks and I think you 
have the or iginal in DC. And as I worked 
for the British, my boss asked me , ﬁ What did you 
do during the war?  And where did you work? And with whom did you work? ﬂ  And some how 
I me ntioned those two months in the office a
nd he said, ﬁWhat did you do? ﬂ  I said, ﬁWell, I 
worked on name s and addresses and kept a roster
 of the SS and a roster of food supplies, and 
how ma ny wome n went to each wo
rk detail,ﬂ because the shipyards where we worked had to 
pay the governme nt for our labor. This is what is
 in dispute now, if you ever see it. And he 
said, ﬁYou worked in the office, and you wrote 
down their name s?  Do you reme mber any?ﬂ I 
said, ﬁAll 42 of them.ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, can™t 
be.ﬂ And he gave me  
a pad and pencil, and I 
wrote them down Œ first name , last name  and address. 
Q:  And address? 

A:  And address because it was in and around Ha
mb urg. It was very easy. I had lived there. I 
knew the place. I spoke the language. He didn™t 
believe me . It took a few weeks. He checked 
it out, and he found out that it was correct, and th
ey took the truck or lorr
ie, as they called it, 
and gradually we picked up one 
after the other, 40 
of them, in and around the city, and they 
all said, ﬁWe never did anything bad unless you
 deserved it. We never beat you. We  never 
did anything.ﬂ Two of them we
re with the Americans in Southern Germany, and they were 
brought up, and I rang usually the door bell, a
nd I asked, ﬁIs Mrs. Miller home ? ﬂ  And then 

her father would yell, ﬁElse Miller, some body 
here for you.ﬂ And, she would come  to the 
door, and the British were righ
t behind me . I had nothing to sa
y. I asked that I could walk 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
123 
 
 
passed the prison, Munsevan (ph) Prison. I just wa
nted to see them behind bars, and they all 
begged for help, and ﬁWe™ve never done anyt
hing,ﬂ and ﬁWe ™ ve always liked you.ﬂ I don™t 
know what else they said. I didn™
t hear a thing. I was once taken to
 the city of Saale (ph) near 
Bergen-Belsen, and it was some  sort of a preliminary deposition. I was asked whether I 
would speak German or English, and I said En
glish, and I had gotten a blouse and a brown 
skirt and I wa s driven in a staff car, in an E nglish car. I don™t reme mber the questions. I don™t 

reme mber the answers. I don™t know what I said
 Œ probably two hours. They thanked me , and 
they rema ined in prison, and a few weeks la
ter I received little notes under the dormi tory 
door where we were housed thre
atening my life. The first one
 was nothing. The second one 
was worrisome, and the third one, I was hysteri cal. Three days later, the British dr ove me 

across the Dutch border into Belgium, into Br
ussels together with
 three other young wome n, 
and from Br ussels to Lille, and the captain whos
e drive drove us. We  we
nt out for dinner in 
Lille and there wasn™t much to eat in ™45 in
 Lille, food was rationed. They had survived a 
war. We ate some chicken, but it tasted like 
leather. I forgot. He was engaged to a young 
woma n. It turned out he was Je
wish and he had been born in 
Berlin, and he put me on the 
train in Lille for Paris, and he gave me the ad
dress of the Centre de Coeur, the youth hostel, 
at quatre bis rue des Rosiers. The me tro opened 
two hours after I arrived in Paris, and I saw a 
Polish officer in the army, and I asked him in Polish, ﬁWhich subway do I take?  How do I get 

there?ﬂ I had only been to Paris once as a 
child. I had no idea. And he told me  and he 

accompanied me , and I was back in the dormitory
 youth hostel, but this time  it was Paris Œ no 
food, the food was rationed. The little clot hing 
I had I had to sell because I needed money. 
And I started visiting the Amer
ican embassy. They saw me  c o mi ng, ﬁThere she is again.ﬂ I 
made a nuisance of myself. I™ve never hated a place as much as I hated Paris at that point. It 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
124 
 
 
was no impr oveme nt except it had no German
s, but living was horrible. I met a young 
Hungarian woma n there which is
 again, another story, who had 
been ma rried in an Or thodox 
ceremony at age 12 to a young man, but it 
was a civil ceremony. It wasn™t a 
chupah.
 That 
was to come  later, but in the eyes of the law, 
she was the legal wife of that man who lived in 
Williamsburg, New York. She eventually married 
him in Wi lliamsburg, but that ™s a totally 
different story. I™ll ma il you that story. And we lived
 six of us in that ti
ny corner on cots with 
an outhouse two stories down, and for a bath in
 Paris you had to pay 2 francs and go down 
the corner to the bat
hhouse. It was 1945, ™46. 
Q:  And the Brits gave you no money? 

A:  No, of course not. They gave me
 food Œ all starchy, I weighed 140 pounds.  
Q:  So, you™re dying to get out of Paris. 

A:  I™m dying to get out of Europe. I got papers 
from a for mer classmate in New York, and I got 
papers eventually for Palestine from t he Br
itish because I was s
howing that letter of 
commendation wherever I could. There were no 
photocopy machines. They wanted to keep 
it, and I didn™t want to let it 
go. It was a big battle. And I got the two papers w
ithin two days 
of each other, and the family decided that my
 cousin who was in the British brigade in 
Einhofen was supposed to ma rry me  Œ ma rry me
 for real. I said, ﬁNo, I™m not comi ng to 
Palestine-ﬂ 
Q:  This is your fa mily who™s in Palestine. 

A:  -I™m going to New York.ﬂ And I paid $500 to get on a me rchant ma rine boat. 

Q:  Where did you get $500? 

A:  My uncle in Palestine sent it 
to a cousin in Belfort, France an
d it got to me. I repaid it, but a 
long time later, with a refrigerator because th
ey couldn™t get refriger
ators. It took 22 days 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
125 
 
 
from Bordeaux to New York because  it was Marc
h, the hold was empty. There were ten of us 
on the boat, and they were all, they were the 
Polish ambassador™s sister-in-law, there was the 
fiancé of a lieutenant colonel. They were peopl
e with consider able clout
 and we landed in the 
Fulton Fish Market after 23 days
, and I was sick all 23 days. A
nd my friend, her parents kept 
me  on their living room couch for a week, and they
 told me  to get a job in a glove factory and 
get myself a rented room. I earned $30 a week 
piece work, $5 went for taxis. I paid $8 for 
rent, and I was ready to go back to Europe. 
I hated it. There was nothing in New York that 
even remotely appealed to me . 
Q:  Really? 

A:  Really. That™s how lonely it was, how isolat
ed Œ I mean, I spoke the language, but there was 
nothing there. Everythi ng I knew, everythi ng that was fa miliar was in Europe. God did I hate 

that work in that glove factor
y. I loved leather, but I hoped I™
d never see leather again, and I 
worked. 
Q:  Where did you live?  Where did you get an apartment?  

A:  I didn™t get an apartment. I got a fu
rnished room on Long Island, on Wo odside Avenue. 

Q:  Really?  And you commuted in? 

A:  I commuted in for a nickel on the subway, a
nd for another nickel, I bought sort of a chocolate 
square, chunky-some thing. That was breakfast. For lunch, I we nt to Chock-Full-o-Nuts, and I 

bought a cream cheese sandwich and a coke and it
 cost a quarter, and any money I had left 
over went for clothing. I went abso
lutely clothing crazy. I didn™t ca
re if the dress cost $10 or 
$15, I just Œ I just had to buy it. So, anytime 
I™d save some  money, I would buy a dress, and 
I™d buy shoes in the cheapest shoe st
ore, it was a chain in New York. 
Q:  Bakers? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
126 
 
 
A:  Bakers Œ very high heels, and I bought them
 a half a size smaller instead of buying a six, I 
bought a five and a half. Why?  I will never know. 
Q:  Didn™t it kill your feet? 
A:  Of course it did. I bought several pairs over 
a period of time, and then my  friend who had 
sent the papers invited me  Œ rather her moth
er did Œ for Friday evening Shabbat dinner 
because my friend™s father was some what cons
ervatively religious, old-fashioned Œ not very, 

but a little.  
Q:  Could you stop for a mo me nt?  Can we stop the tape?   

[Break in tape] 

Q:  Okay, we™re back. I™m sorry for that interr
uption. So, you™re going to
 this house for dinner. 
A:  And there was my friend and her husband Œ sh
e had married early, I th
ink at 17 or 18 Œ and 
she was quite disturbed at the time. I don™t 
know what the problems were, and nobody ever 
asked me , ﬁWhere have you come  from?  What had you done?  Where had you worked? ﬂ  
Nothing Œ the past was a taboo in New York. It
 wasn™t me ntioned. It wasn™t addressed. 
Nobody wa nted to know. They saw the newsreel, nobody spoke. And at that party wa s my 
friend and her husband, her brothe
r and his wife, and her brother™s friend. And we had dinner 

and I guess we were introduced, and at one point  
his last  name was dropped because at first it 
was only fi rst names, and when I heard ﬁEichengreenﬂ, the name was familiar. I had met the 

Eichengreens on the way to the ghetto. 
Q:  This is Julie? 

A:  And Julius, and they had spoken of a son 
who was in Cuba and would go to the States. I 
asked him about his parents and 
the answer was very evasive. 
He had just come  out of the 
army, and then several weeks later he called Œ 
or he called my  friend™
s mo ther and he asked 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
127 
 
 
where exactly had I come from?  Or was I in
 Hamburg?  Had I hear
d anything about his 
parents? And I called him back and I said, ﬁPro
bably.ﬂ And I me t him ag
ain for dinner at that 
house, and after dinner we walked from Sunnys
i de, Long Island Œ no, it wasn™t in Sunnyside. 
It was in Rego Park Œ we walked back to S
unnyside. It was about a three-hour walk and I 
told him the whole story. It was, I think, the 
only time we ever talked about it. We  started 
dating, and that must have been April or May. 
Q:  Lucille, let me  ask you some thing. What™s
 going through you now Œ thinking about telling 
Dan about his parents? 
A:  The waste Œ the waste of a 
fa mily. We started dating in May 
and he ma de me  go to evening 
school. At least I learned to type
 and take some  shorthand. In July, we went to see his cousins 
in Los Angeles, and I liked them, cousins on bot
h sides of the fa mily, on the mother™s side 
and on the father™s side. The mother™s side is 
partly Dreyfuss and Reinsburg and the father™s 
Eichengreen. And on the train from New York to
 Los Angeles, he proposed, and I said I had 
to think it over, and I thought it ov
er and I said yes. It took a fe
w days, but his aunt and uncle 
in New York and his ma ny cousins in New Yo
rk made one statement which they haven™t 
lived down yet. ﬁWe don™t need an Eastern Eu
ropean Jew in the family, and we don™t need 
some body from the camps.ﬂ The irony of that re
ma rk was that all the other cousins married 
Eastern European Jews, but ma ny 
ye ars later. I wa s just the first one. And of course, there 
was no contact. I did not want to see them or 
visit them. There was very little cont act. 
Q:  Are these the same  people who ma de  dinner for you? 

A:  No, those are strangers in the famil
y. The fa mily lived in Wa s hington Heights. 
Q:  So, you never saw them. 

A:  And at 69
th
 Street. Very rarely, once when they ca
me  to California, but not Œ basically no.

Q:  So, you were still 
Ostjuden
? 
A:  Of course, we are still. When 
we go to Berlin today, we are still 
Ostjuden
. There™s a decided 
difference. I spoke to people now in Germany 
whose parents came from Lodz, but they were 
born after the war like my child
ren. They consider themselves German, a nd I said, ﬁJust 
scratch the surface. You™re a Polish Je w kid.ﬂ  
Q:  So, tell me , there are at least three ot
her me n who said they wanted to marry you. 
A:  No, they didn™t really sa
y it, but they were interested. 
Q:  They were interested. 
A:  They were interested. 

Q:  When did you fall in love with Dan?  Did you 
fall in love before than he asked you to ma rry 
him?  
A:  No, about the same  time. He was very well 
read. He was very well educated. He saw that I 
read all the right books at the 
right time, and he brought them. 
He worked for Baker & Taylor 
in New York, which was the largest book 
distributor on Fifth Avenue down on 14
th
 Street or 
some thing. He was an export ma nager. He took me out for dinner. I could eat decently rather 

than ma keshift. He took me  to Carnegie Hall. 
He took me  to the theater. He took me  to the 

opera. And I took him to the Yiddish Theater on 
Second Avenue. I think it was the first time 
he heard of Saul Toma s zewski. His gra
ndson now conducts the San Francisco Symp hony Œ 
Tilson Thomas Œ still To maszewski. 
Q:  So, did Dan also ma ke you like New York? 

A:  Yes, life changed. We  found an apartment. 
We  pa id key mone y or black money because you 
couldn™t get anything. We starte
d out in a room the size- 
Q:  What does that mean ‚key money™? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
129 
 
 
A:  After the war, there were no apartments in
 New York. You Œ we paid about $75 for a little 
glass enclosed porch and could use the kitchen 
and the bath of the la
ndlady, and eventually 
some body t old us, ﬁThere™s an apartment 
vacant in Sunnyside, and if you give the 
superint endent $500, he will let you have the apar
tment.ﬂ And we did. It was a lot of money 
Œ it was a lot of ar my pay. We  got ma rried in 
Wa shington Heights in the rabbi™s house. Dan™s 
fa mily did show up. Only an old friend of 
my mother™s showed because there was nobody 
else, and my classmate, and we went for thr
ee days in a hired car to Goshen, upstate New 
York, because we had to get ma rried on a Thursday because we had to go back to work on 

Monday. 
Q:  And the date of your ma rriage? 

A:  Nove mber 7, 1946. 

Q:  And this is Nove mber 7, 2001. 

A:  We Œ I changed jobs, and I started to work 
for Lionel. Do you reme mber those big toy trains? 
Q:  Absolutely. 

A:  That whistled when you threw a little pill 
in it, and it smoked? And it went around the track?  
I worked for the export departme nt
 of Lionel. I learned to type. 
Q:  So, did you type well finally? 

A:  Not–90 words a mi nute. 

Q:  That™s very good. 

A:  I learned to operate a Di
ctaphone. In those days we had 
Dictaphones, no computers, and I 
worked there from ™46 to ™49, and then an ol
d friend colleague of my hus band™s came to New 
York, and he had started a small business in 
San Francisco, and he said, ﬁPack up your car 
and come  out. You will work for me  and I™ll gi
ve  you $75 to start with a week,ﬂ which was a

lot of money. And we picked up the Pl ymouth and we drove out. First we had a ™39 
Plymouth, then we had a ™45, ™46 Plymouth.  
Q:  Moving up. 

A:  And we drove in three days from Ne w Yo
rk to San Francisco, day and night. We  drove 
straight through. 
Q:  You didn™t even stop to see the scenery? 

A:  No, we couldn™t afford to, and the whole back wa s all full of whatever we had in clothing, 
and I had a little portable sewing ma c hine fo
r some odd reason, and a portable typewriter, 

which with covered key, I™d le
arned to type. I got a job in 
San Francisco at We stinghouse, 
and I needed FBI clearance because  they were 
dealing with turbines and ge nerators and 
whatever we had to use against the Russian
s in those days, and 
it was a very uptight  
organization. There was not another Jew in th
e whole organization, but it was pleasant and I 
think I ma de some thing like $300 a month which was a lot of money in 1950, and Dan 
wanted children very much, and I was very undecided, but we  had the first child in 1952, and 
I stopped working for a while. 
Q: Were you on the fence about having children, br
inging children into the world, or being a 
mother?  
A: I didn™t want to. 

Q: You didn™t want to brin
g children into the worl d? 
A: No, not into this world, and we bought a lo
t in Be rkeley because Dan™s boss lived in 
Berkeley, and we build a two-bedroom house Œ 
a redwood house with a view of the Golden 
Gate Bridge, and then we decided we ought to 
have at least two child
ren, and then we add 
two rooms a nd a bath. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0417  
131 
 
 
Q: And were you then - it wa
s okay to have children? 
A: Then it was okay. 
Q: Why?  

A: Because life had meaning. Life had norma lized. 
I accepted the past. I resent ed the past, but I 
accepted the past, that it was a part of me , a
nd I asked myself whether I could live without 
the past, and I couldn™t. So, it was all right. The 
kids grew up in Berkeley, and I went back to 
school. I went first to the colleg
e of arts and crafts, and then 
went to Contra Costa College, 
and then I we nt to UC. It took a long time. A
nd then I went to Golden Gate College, and I 
finished the business courses, and I got a job as an insurance broker, and I worked there for 

about 20 years, which made it possible to send 
the kids through college without having to 
take out a loan. It gave the kids music less
ons, tennis lessons, riding lessons Œ you name  it, 
they had it.  
Q: And what is Dan doing all th
is time? What™s the business? 
A: Dan worked for this old friend. It was a fa
irly successful busine
ss. They ma de modern 
fireplace equipment. They ma nufactured it. 
It was a very time consuming job, a dema nding 
job because the ma n was  very difficult, very 
uneducated, very unschooled, from a very poor 
fa mily in Germany. The father rolled cigars fo
r a living, and he also 
was an alcoholic. The 
mother was Orthodox. But some how the contrast
 between these two me n ma de the business 
work, because Dan was level-ha nded. He was volatile. He also became an alcoholic as he 

became affluent, and Dan had to carry him to 
bed when they went on a business trip. We 
went a couple of times to New York because th
ere was a show at the Œ Columbus Circle I 
think. And life turned normal. 
Q: You found a  very good person.
