 September 14, 2005 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Me
morial Museum interview with John Meyerstein. 
Answer: Stein. 
Q: John Meyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on Ju
ly first, 2004, in Wa shington, D.C. This is 
tape number one, side A. Just for the recor
d, would you tell me your name , where you live now, 
and when and where you were born. 

A: Okay. My name  is John Meyerstein. I was or
iginally called Hans Meyerstein, but when we 
arrived in England after the St. Louis voyage, it wa
s suggested to my parents that -- that they 

give me  an English first name , and the name  John was chosen, I™m not sure how, and it™s -- from 

that mo ment onwards it became that, and my par ent
s never used any other name  but that, at the 
time. I currently live in Oakville, Ontario, which is
 about 20 miles west of Toronto. I was born in 
Halle, Germany, on the 21
st
 of March, 1935.  
Q: Mm-hm. Tell me, do you have ma ny me mori
es of those first years in Ge rmany? 

A: Truthfully I have to say no. I know that some
 people say that they 
can reme mber everything 

when they were in a pram, or a cradle. I have to
 be truthful and say I do 
not recall those sort of 
things.  

Q: Okay. Tell me  about your parents, th
eir name s, and where they were from.  
A: My father was Ludwig Meyerstein. He wa
s born in Rosslau, Germany in -- on March the 10
th
, 
1893. My mother was Alice Meye rstein, born Ali
ce Eisner, and she was born in a -- a place 
called Gutentag, in Upper Silesia, Germany, on the 29
th
 of June, 1910.  
Q: And do you know wh-where they me t, a
nd how -- how they came to be ma rried? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487

A: How they me t I don™t know, I rather suspect it 
was one of these arranged ma rriages. Both my 
fa milies --  both my parent™s families were fi nancially very well off, and I can only conclude that 
it was assume d that this would be a good way of 
having a marriage. My mother never discussed 
it, in fact she probably talked to my wife year
s later on things which she didn™t discuss with me . 
But how they actually met, and -- I don™t know, I 
rather think it was a -- an arranged ma rriage, 
but how that was done, if -- if my assessment is correct, I have no idea.  

Q: And your father served in World War 
1
, I understand. 
A: Yes, he was -- he served in 
-- four  years in -- in World War 
1
, together with an older brother, 
who also served fo -- four years, and a younger 
brother, who was also in -- in World War 
1
, but 
who did not come  back, he was killed in -- in 
1918, I think, a week or two before Armi stice Day, 
and was listed as mi ssing in action, and never -- ne
ver found again, actually. 
So there were three 
brothers, of which my fa ther was one, went to 
the wars, in 1914 - ™18, and only two came  back. 
Q: You know what -- what kind of service 
your father performe d, or whe r e he was -- 
A: My -- I -- I -- I think my fa
ther™s younger brother was in an in
fantry regime nt. My father and 
his elder brother, Hugo -- and I should say that
 my father™s younger brother, the one who was 
killed in 1914 - ™18, was called Hans, and that wa
s why I was originally called Hans, because my 
grandmother wanted to have a -- a grandson follo
wing that name . My father and his elder brother 
Hugo both served in cal -- cavalry
 regime nts to begin with, and 
I s -- I don™t know how far the 
cavalry went, because as you know, things change
d, and cavalry re -- regiments then became 
extinct almost, and presumably went into infant
ry regime nts. My father™s elder brother Hugo 
came out at the end of the war as a captain, and 
my father ended the war, I think, as a second 
leftenant.  

Q: Do you know where he served, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
3 
 
 
A: No. 
Q: -- did he see combat? 

A: I -- I -- I think they both di
d, I do not know where they served. I believe it was always on the 
western front, because  I think that my  father w
ould have me ntioned some th
ing if -- if -- if it had 
been elsewhere on the eastern front at that tim
e. I have my father™s military b-book, you know, of 
the class of -- of 19 f -- I can™t think what they
 call it now, class of 1914, or -- or some thing like 
that. But it doesn™t show exactly 
where all these things were, it wa -- just  like a military record 
book, which I had years later in the British army, wh
en I was drafted. But I™ve also since, in the 
last -- si nce my father™s death, found my grandf
ather™s military book, and he was in the class of 
1879, in the militia, in an artillery regi me nt. So, 
on my father™s side of the fa mily, military 

activity was not a -- an unusual 
activity, despite what the -- the Germans said, that  ther e were 
that few -- not that ma ny Jews volunteered or f
ought, that was totally inco
rrect. I do recall that 
my father mentioned to me  that 
he provi -- that his father, my 
grandfather, provided the horses, 
and gave them money and so forth, because in th
e units which they had to serve, particularly 
since they ultimately ended up in -- with -- in
 the commission rank, that
 required more funding, 
and my parents were obviously in -- in a position 
to -- to -- to -- to -- to
 -- to provide that. The 
other thing which I found rather inte
resting, contrary to what I some
times read, is that my father, 
on one or two occasions, and these were things whic
h we could always disc uss, said to me  that 
when he entered the -- the cavalry regime nt, or 
was in -- was -- w-was organized to go to this 
unit, that the -- the colonel of 
the regime nt said to him, ﬁ Well, Meyerstein, you can™t say that 
there are any anti -- anti-Jews 
here, otherwise you wouldn™t be
 here.ﬂ So again, I find it 
some ti me s a bit awkwa -- difficult to understand wh
en I read various documents, as to what took 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
4 
 
 
-- actually took place. Obviously there were anti
-Jewish Germans, and there were Germans who 
didn™t view this in any shape or form. Whethe
r that™s normal, I can™t
 say actually, you know.  
Q: Right, right. 

A: And they -- and my brother -- and one other 
thing which I think you mi ght find interesting -- 

and this was apparently -- this wa -- gi
ven to me  by my mother, who had a very good 
relationship in terms of - -  of f-friendship w
ith my father™s br other, is after World War 
1
, when 
the German army was reorganized -- this was told
 by my Uncle Hugo to my mother, they got in 
touch with my Uncle Hugo, who obviously hada very good military record, and said, ﬁ Why 

don™t you come  back into the German army? ﬂ  And he said, ﬁWell, you know, I™m Je wish.ﬂ And -

- and apparently they said to him, ﬁWell, w
hy don™t you just say you™re 
Christian, it won™t any 
difference,ﬂ and -- and left  it. He didn™t, of cour
se, do that. Wh at I™m getting at it™s so peculiar 
and so strange in what s
ubsequently took place.  
Q: What business was your father™s family in? 
A: My father™s family had a -- what you would 
call a small departme nt store in Rosslau. They 
were the only Jewish fa mily in this entire co
mmunity. In fact my grandmother, my f-father™s 

mother, was also born in this -- in Rosslau, a
nd I have the documents, th
e birth certificate, and 
the ma rriage certificate to my grandf
ather, also i-in -- in my fi le
s. And apparently he wa s quite 
successful in that respect, and -- and was con
tinued, I think, until the German -- until the Nazis 
came to power, and of course ultimately 
that was all taken away from them.  
Q: They were the only Jews in that town? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Huh. So there was no synagogue 
or communit y there that -- 
A: No. No -- not at all. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
5 
 
 
Q: Were they just full assimilated [i ndecipherable]  
A: Absolute -- I -- I -- I would 
have to say yes, because I have  -- if you look at the bi rth 
certificates, and the ma rriage certif
icates of both sides of my gr
andparents, you will find that the 
name s are all traditional German name s. M-My fa
ther is Ludwig. My elder -- his elder brother 
Hugo, my -- hi-his younger brother Hans, the on
e who was killed, and who I was name d a f -- 
Hans. My grandmother was name d Rosian, which li
terally trans --  mean little rose. My -- my 
grandfather was Max. If you look at
 his parent™s birth certificates
, it™s Magnus, which is really 
like a Latin name , and the grandmother, I think 
was -- great-grand -- was Regina. But this also 
applies to my father™s -- grandmother -- my mo
ther™s grandparents in 
like ma nner. So when 
people say to me , well what Jewish name s did th
ey have, I have to be honest and say I don™t 
honestly know. My mother, for exampl
e is Alice, spelled the same  way 
in English as it is in -- in 
-- in German, except in German it™s a different
 pronunciation. So the documents which I have 

finally found among my father™s papers, after a l
ong time, so far I™ve -- I™ve sor -- deciphered 
that they™ve gone back to about 1822, and they™r
e all -- the Christian na
me s, the first name s, 
were all literally almost -- you could say either 
they were English or they were Germa n, but 
totally integr ated. And I suspect that that -- 
the shock of what subs
equent happened, they 
probably couldn™t believe wh
at was taking place.  
Q: Yeah, yeah. Your father™s family, you sai
d, had a department store in that time  -- 
A: Well, I would call it a department store in th
e like ma nner, and I have seen pictures of it a 
little bit.  

Q: And your father worked there? 

A: No, my father -- my father became a barr
ister and a judge, moved to Halle, where I was 

ultimately born, practiced criminal law. And ironically -- Halle is a very big chemical loca -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487

area, even I think to this day. 
And i-ironically, which I didn™t real
ize, he never discussed it, but 
my mother me ntioned it to me , and also my cous
in who lives in Australia, whose mo ther is my 
father™s -- was my father™s sist er, told me that he
 was also the outside counsel for I.G. Farben, the 
big German chemical company, which ultimately 
ma de the -- the ma terial which was doing the 
gas chambers. Course, this all -- we™re not talkin
g about that particular 
period, we™re talking in 
the -- in the 30™s and so forth. So my  father 
had a very successful, an-and according to my 
mother was a very well known cr
iminal barrister i-in Halle.  
Q: And he would have been there through the 20™s? 
A: Ah, yes. 

Q: An-And then you were born there in 1934? 

A: ™35. 

Q: ™35 - ™35. And what about your mother™s fami
ly, what business were th
ey in?  You said that 
they were also -- 
A: My -- my  mother™s parents lived, as I menti
oned, in -- in Gutentag, wh
ich is an interesting 
name  because it means good day, or good morning -- in Uppe r Silesia, almost on the -- on the 
Polish border. My -- she had one 
brother called Lota, and her father was Ludwig Eisner, and my 
grandmother, my mother™s mother, was Rosa 
Eisner. They owned what you would call a farm 
equipment wholesale business. And I have pict
ures, I found pictures. I have no idea how they 
ma naged to keep these particular pictures, or 
br ing them with them considering all the other 
problems which they were experiencing. Where my 
grandfather had -- you could see the trucks 
outside his -- th-the fi -- th-t
he fami l y business and home , with the telephone number, and on the 
truck, branded name s of things like percil and 
so forth, even American products. They did farm 
equipment, I would sort of say, you know, whic
h supplied the farming c o mmunity, which was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
7 
 
 
predominantly Polish speaking, although this Uppe
r S-Silesia was of course Germany, and had 
been for 150 years or so. And very successful as well. 
Q: So let™s start now with -- 
with -- your father wa s arrest
ed, I understand, in -- in 1938? 
A: Well, actually, he was initial -- he was arrest ed tw
i ce. The fi rst  ti  -- my  
fa -- my father™s si ster 
emigrated with her husband to Australia as a resu
lt of fr iends which they
 had who -- who helped 
them there. And one of the -- also from Ger man
y, also German Jews. And one of the German 
Jews had some  business things which were required 
to -- to be handled, and I believe, and this is 

only -- I™m only surmising this, cause we never di 
-- I only heard this from 
my  mo t h e r ,  my  fa t h e r  
took over some  activities. This was, or been public
 perhaps early ™38 or so. And for some  reason 
or another, you know, at that tim
e, the -- the German governme nt wa
s already starting to try and 
take money, or -- and various other things from 
- -  from Ger man -- from German Jews, and their 
businesses. And he was arrested and held for 
six weeks in Halle -- but
 it was obviously nowhere 
near anyt hing which subsequently took place -- and 
was released. And then, I think after Kristall 
night, which was in the latter part of 1938, my fath
er was arrested and taken to Buchenwald. My 
mother™s father was also arrest ed and taken to 
Buchenwald. My father™s -- my mother™s brot her, 

Lota, was also arrested and taken to Buchenwa
ld. And they found each other there, of all -- I 
mean, most incredible, found each other. All three got out. Now, you have to reme mb er, my 

father was a first World War veteran, my grandfat
her, my mo ther™s mother -- father was also a 
veteran. And I have subsequently read books an
d documents which indicate that the Germans 
basically said to some  of these people, ﬁBecau
se of your activities as, you know, in World Wa r 
1
, 
we™re going to let you go. But you have so ma ny da
ys or weeks, and if you are still here in 
Germany, then we -- if when we re-arrest you ag
ain, we™ll never -- you™ll never get out.ﬂ So I 
believe my father must have got out, proba
bly in early 1939. I don™t 
know which day, and my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
8 
 
 
grandfather. My Uncle Lota also got out, 
but I don™t know exactly when, and under what 
conditions, but they did, and I ha
ve proof of the fact, perma -- doc
umentation that my father then 
applied for visa to the United States in, I thi
nk, Fe bruary of 1939. So be
tween Kristallnacht and 
entry into Buchenwald, and now it must have b
een somewhere between that time, and shall we 
say the end of January, or -- so he was ra
ther lucky to get out at that time .  
Q: Let me  go back and ask you when your -- your fath
er™s sister left Germany to go to Australia. 
A: That would have been some
where in 1938, I go -- I believe. 
Q: [indecipherable] in the same  year, then. 
A: But before Kristallnacht. 

Q: Before? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And it was an escape in a sense, a sense of
 -- of being unsafe for Jews and the decision to 
leave [indecipherabl e] 
A: We ll, I -- yes, I -- I think you™re right, but Ithink the motivating factor mi ght have come  more 
from my aunt™s husband, as distinct from other 
things. My mo ther has mention -- mentioned to 
me  on several occasions as a boy when I asked qu
estions, that I think sometime in ™38 -- when, I 
don™t know, I think be fore Kristallnacht, okay, thatthe families got together. My father™s family, 

of which really, was really in my grandmother,
 because my -- my grandfather on my father™s 
side, died in 1929, so th -- you know, none of this 
would have applied, got 
together, and sort of 
said what we  could -- what -- what should we 
do, because at that time you still, from what I™ve 
been given to understand from my mother, 
you could still take out
 all your money and 
belongings without any problems. But they coul
dn™t come  to any conclusion. And you have to 
reme mber, from my father™s side of the fa mily, 
it was -- I have the documents to the early 1800™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
9 
 
 
and my father always used to say to me  it wa
s even before, you know whe -- they were more 
German than the Germans. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Okay, if you want to put it this wa y. Now, I don™t 
th -- I don™t thi
nk that that was quite as di -- 
as long on my mother™s side of the family, b
ecause I understand that from their aspects, my 
mother™s grandfather, m- my gra -- my great-grandfather came from Poland in the days when 

Poland was under Russian law, and rode across the 
border into Germany, into -- into Silesia. 
Because in those days the Russians used to call 
people up for military service, and it wasn™t just 
a two year stint, it was 20 years before they were
 released. So I suspect th
at they -- his parents, 
great-great-grandparents, sort of said you™d bette
r get out and -- and -- and go some where else. 

But, if you follow what I™m getting at, it™s that de
pth of -- of period. But my parent, when they 
had the meeting with -- with the two fa milies, 
obviously couldn™t come to lo -- to a conclusion. 
We™re sitting here toda y saying why not
?  I can™t answer that question.  
Q: Yeah, yeah. [indecipherable] interesting to kn
ow what that conversation was like, what the 
arguments were [indecipherable] 

A: I -- I get the impression from her mother th
at  -- th-the -- the women 
on the one hand wanted 
to go, and the me n -- you have to remember that my father was a very successful barrister, even 

though things had already declined, I don™t know 
to what degree how far. Everything which I 
read, where everythi ng is stated, 
regulations do this, yes it™s true , but things still some how, how 
did they ma nage to survive and live with no 
income  comi ng i n?  Because although things were 
tightening, you could still 
spend money, if you had it. 
Q: Yeah, right. 

A: And, you know, perhaps they just thought 
that this was just
 an aberration.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
10 
 
 
Q: Yeah. And the wome n wanted to go, the women were clearer -- 
A: We ll, I understand on my mother™s side, he
r mother, and my mother wanted to go. My 
father™s mother was not enthusiastic, but I don™
t know that, I™m just giving you comments which 
my mother said to me. 

Q: Right, right. So your father
comes home from Buchenwald, 
do you have any me mo ry of that? 
A: No. I can only tell you that my mother went 
to pick him up, so she mu st have been notified. 
And she had to go by train because Ha lle to Bu
chenwald is not, you know, a -- a bus ride. And 

my mother said that nothing happened to her physi
cally, they were just, y
ou know, they just told 
to go sit in a corner in the -- of the waiting room
, or wherever. Of the entrance or whatever it 
was. Nobody bothered her, but nobody was very
 -- nobody was terribly polite, but nobody was 
terribly rude, they just  said go sit over  there, a
nd -- and -- and that was it.
 And I have to assume  

that it was done by train. My mo
ther said that, you know, from th
at day onwards, my father -- 
there were no -- no more argument about leaving. A
nd I have to conclude that -- that my father 
was too stunned and shattered at what had happe
ned. And even though he™d been four years in 
the first Wor l d Wa r, I have to conclude that
 there was -- the -- what -- what  he saw and 
experienced in Buchenwald had no comparison to 
what we read about, what took place in World 
War  
1
, where it was st ri ctly military and -- and not the ot her scenarios, but he was on th -- we 
never discussed that, he -- he -- 
he could not -- he could not -- 
Q: Talk about it. 

A: No, or he wouldn™t talk a
bout it, let™s put it that way.  
Q: We ll then, we™re comi ng close to the time  
when you -- you and your mother and father, and 
your grandfather, you mother™s father, left
 together to go on the [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
11 
 
 
A: Well, that ™s an interesting aspect, yes. My 
grandfather, on my -- ma  -- my mother™s father, 
had some  relatives who had emigrated to the United States. I think it would have had to be in the 
very late 18 -- the la
tter part of the 1800™s. Ho
w they got in touch with 
these relatives, I really 
don™t know, but they di d. And where the exact relationshi p was I don™t know, because I 

ultimately met these people in the United Stat
es, and they were the ones who provided the 
sponsorship bond documents. And they
 couldn™t really explain the ex
act relationship as to how -- 
whether it was their mother, mother™s moth
er or so. And as you know, when people went 
through Ellis Island, name s got changed, or people 
married each other on th
e boat, I -- I really 
can™t te -- I™m sorry, I really ca
n™t tell you how that happened, othe
r than that two 
of the relatives 
-- and I have [indecipherable] gave me  so
me  of the documents, which I didn™t know  
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah. I don™t -- I™ve me t the m. Y
ears later I me t the m, a nd they viewed me  as very distant, we 
viewed each other as very distant cousins, but
 none of us could exactly explain where the 
connection -- the third person shown on those do
cume nts, I have no idea, other than it was 
obviously a very generous individual.  
Q: Let™s look at that, as long as we™re talki
ng about it, because we can me ntion the name s on 

tape, because I have those document here as 
well. This is the one 
you™re talking about. 
A: Yes. Edna Cohn, when I me t her was already in 
her -- I -- either late 
60™s or early 70™s and 
we™re now talking over 30 - 40 years ago, almost 
-- or -- or longer. Edna was not ma r r ied, and 

apparently she spent her life in --
 in a stockbroking -- most of her 
career in a stockbroking office. 
When we met it was in California, not in Chicag
o, they™d retired for health or weather reasons. 
Sa muel Fox was ma rried to Edna Cohn™s sister, 
Miriam. Sa muel Fox was not a relative, or any 
connection, but he was ma rried to Miriam, and ha
d been a pharmacist in [indecipherable] and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
12 
 
 
and had his own business in Chicago. Aaron Stei
n, also from Chicago, who is the third affiant 
here shown in the documents, I don™t know who th
at is, other than obviously a very generous 
person. They put up the money for the bonds, whic
h enabled my parents and my grandfather, 
where the connection was, Ludwig Ei
sner to -- to put applications 
in, and I believe the -- the sort 
of certificates, the -- what do they call them, vi
sa application numbers are the ones shown here as 
well, for the three of us. This
 document also shows Ludwig Eisner, which the museum here 
didn™t know who it was, although it 
was -- he was listed in all th
e -- the museum documents. But 
he happened to be my grandfathe
r, and he™s shown here actually. 
Q: Uh-huh, they didn™t know that. 

A: And they didn™t know that. They do now.  

Q: So these three people put up the money, and -- 

A: These three people, yeah -- 

Q: -- presumably had never me t your parents? 
A: Didn™t even know my
 parents existed. 
Q: Didn™t know they 
existed until they -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- presumably got a letter fr
om some one, ma ybe your father. 

A: Not my father, would have had to be from my
 grandfather,because he
 -- Ludwig Eisner, my 
father™s father-in- law. 

Q: Right. That™s amazing.  

A: Yes, and I -- how that ever happene d, how they 
got th -- th -- how they traced each other, I 
don™t honestly know. 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
13 
 
 
A: And they didn™t know themselves, when I me t 
them years later. And -- and the re -- the 
relationship was -- was tremendous. And years la
ter Edna Cohn and her sister Miriam Fox, 
visited England, and at that time  -- to see my pa
rents, and at that time
 my parents financially 
were in a position to repay -- 
Q: The bond. 

A: -- the bond. And I have comment s -- I have lette
rs in my -- in my father™s papers, which I 
found in -- in -- really in the last year or so, 
because where my  parents -- my father died six 
weeks short of 93, and my moth
er subsequently, almost 20 y
ears younger, died two ye -- in 
2001, at 91 and a half. So you imagine, I had almost a hundred years worth of com -- 

amalga ma ted documents to look through, that wh
ich had survived, and so forth. And I found 
letters which Edna Cohn [indecipherable] written to 
my father in England, to
 sort of say -- they 
were still sending them some  money, not to worry about that, so I imagine that must have 

depressed my father considerably.  
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: But they were able to repay that. 

Q: They pa -- have repaid the bond, how much was it? 

A: I™ve no idea. 

Q: Yeah. Interesting. 

A: I -- in -- in terms of -- of today™s currency, 
I don™t know what the cost, the Holocaust Museum 
probably, would know what a bond for a visa -- I mean, it was a standard, I would imagine, a 

standard visa bond. What it was, I don™t really 
know, translated into 2004 currency valuations 
today, I would imagine is -- mi ght be some what 
more expensive, I don™t know. But it was very 
generous of them. And if it hadn™t been for th
em, we probably wouldn™t ha
ve been sitting here.

Q: Right, right. I™m going to flip this tape 
over, while we™re at a 
breaking point here.  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John 
Meyerstein. This is tape one, si
de B. So tell me  now what you 
know about the -- the decision to 
leave, and the purchase of the tic
ket, if you know anything at all. 
A: Okay. I don™t know a great deal of how it wa
s done. I can only conclude from my mother™s 
comments, that the mo ment my fathe r  was releas
ed from Buc henwald, and them -- and i-in -- in 
similar manner, I suspect, al
though probably not on the same day, my gra ndm -- my mother™s 
fath -- my grandfather on my mother™s side. Th
ey didn™t really have mu
ch choice about leaving, 
because that which I™ve read in more recent times
 would indicate that they were probably told 
you have a mi ni mu m pe riod of time, and if we find you again, you have to go. We ™re -- we™re -- 
we™ll arrest you and -- and you™ll ne
ver be let out again. How they 
got tickets on the St. Louis, 
who organized that, and in what ma nner, I don™t 
know. I do know that my  parents -- and this is 
only what my mother told me , that they already 
knew that they would have to leave, even though 
my father and my grandfather were in Buch
enwald, some thing would have to be done, or 
imme diately after Buchenwald. And my grandmot
her -- my -- on my moth
er™s side, came down 
from Gutentag, presumably to Halle, and they
 went -- they bought th
ings, including jewelry, 
which they sewed -- from what I™m told, stitched 
into furnitu -- into the furniture, cause in those 
days, and this is where the anomaly is so incred
ible is, you could take everything that you had, or 
you could buy it. So they took two complete cont
ainers, which I would be
 -- the equivalent of 
say -- I don™t know what a container in those da
ys would be viewed. Today, two con -- small 
containers would be 20 foot containers, which I ga
ther was furniture, stove, fridge, whatever. In 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487

fact, I™ve often wondered about it, and said to my
 mother, why on earth would you take electrical 
appliances, that don™t apply when we ended up in
 -- in -- in England, and -- and so forth. Clo -- 
everything which they had. And these all came on 
board the -- the St. Louis with us. We  never 
got them at the end, but I mean, that -- that™s 
a different story, and we 
can get to that in due 
course. How they did that, I don™t know. I thi
nk the jewelry, and it was viewed as being a 
dangerous thing, but they didn™t think that peop
le would -- the -- the Germans would be tearing 
open the -- the -- the -- the furniture and so 
forth. They mi ght  check your clothing, but they 
wouldn™t do anything else. And that
 was -- they hope would, if they
 got to wherever they were 
going, they could then sell those things and wh
ich -- provide some mo
ney. Because as you know, 
when we left on the St. Louis, I think -- I don
™t know what the amount wa s, probably, you know, 
five or six U.S. dollars at that time -- or I 
don™t know, not much more. 
So in other words, you 
had money when you -- before you left the ga -- 
the dockside, you climbed on the St. Louis, and 
you had nothing left at the time, so we -- we ha
d no money on -- on that. Everything had already 
been paid for on the St. Louis. But how that ac
tually happened, I really
 don™t know. At th -- it 
was never explained to me , and I -- I™ve asked my 
-- I have some  cousins in Australia from my 
mother™s side, and they don™t know. They know even less than I do. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Do you have
 any me mory of the ship? 
A: Not a great deal. I -- I gather
 that I was apparently -- I go
t lost on -- it was -- it was like a 
luxury liner. Perhaps the word luxury™s a bit too st
rong, but it was -- it was 
a very pleasant cruise 
ship. It was like -- for b -- I -- 
a-again, and it™s not some thing that my parents discussed with me , 
but what I™ve subly read is, you know, it was us
ed for -- people would, in better time s, go on 
holiday. And apparently I 
-- I got lost some where, and that ca
used a great panic for my  mother, 
and then they found me , or my 
grandfather found me , and with no 
problem. But that™s about the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
16 
 
 
only thing I can reme mb er. I™ve got 
one or two pictures, but they re
ally aren™t -- three or four, 
that you wouldn™t know it™s the St. 
Louis, it -- a-and they™re not in
 groups of people, and quite 
frankly, I don™t -- I don™t have
 a big recollection on that. 
Q: Did your parents take 
those photographs?  Do you know? 
A: I don™t know. I™m not convinced th
at they did. I think my father
 -- I think my father was too 
stunned.  
Q: Stunned, yeah. 

A: I ga -- the pictures which I have, and there ar
e only about two or three, I can see a cor -- wh-
whe -- when -- when people were taken to Buchenwald, s -- as I understand it, you know, it was 

like a -- you know, it was already -- it
 wasn™t a death camp as they subsequent became, but it was 
already a death camp, so everybody got shaved. And 
I -- and when we -- the pictures on the St. 

Louis with my father, you can see his hair growi
ng back again, but he looked still, quite gaunt. 

My grandfather was alwa ys bald, and so you can™t tell from those pictures. And of course, 
they™re all dressed again in -- in clothes and su
its and ties and so forth. But you can see in my 
father™s pi cture, at least I can, perhaps to me, th
-the trauma  of what had happened, and I™m not so 
sure that he took them. He -- he -- for years he
 didn™t want to be photogr
aphed, and whether that 
was a remi nder of the way these things happe
n, I don™t know. Even in better time s, you know. 
But I™m not sure. I don™t think so. He wouldn™t 
be standing around. He -- 
he was not the -- he 
was not an outward going person. My mother was, 
he was more reserved. Perhaps it related to 
his profession, perhaps it related to his -- he was a 19
th
 century person, having been born before 
the turn of the centur
y. And I -- I -- he once sa
id to me  that, you know, he -- he didn™t like the 
20
th
 century at all, which of course is understand
able. He was much more comfortable in -- in 
that er a. And wit -- wi -- refl ects itself in the -- 
the relationship which we ha
d together. It actually 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
17 
 
 
changed a little bit when we ha
d grandchildren -- when I had gr
andchildren, which of course he 
always used to say to me  he never thought he w
ould have because he was so much older in that 
respect. And he lived long enough to s -- to see 
my eldest daughter go to university, which of 
course was a great thing for him.  
Q: Mm-hm. So the -- the storie
s that you ma y have from the voya
ge, are all things that your 
mother -- 

A: Correct. 

Q: -- and par -- and father -- 

A: No, my father discus-- 

Q: No -- not your father. 

A: -- scussed not a single thing. 
No, we could never talk on thos
e matters, and my mother asked 
me not to. I tried once as a -- as a mi d-teenager, 
and my father started to get emotionally very 
upset. And my mother came in the room, and -- a
nd saw what was happening, gathered what was 
happening, and just pulled me  to one side and sa
id, don™t ask, and stop it, and I said I™m sorry, 
and he calme d down and that was the end. We  c
ould talk on other ma tters, prior to 1933. Now, 
the -- the horrendous things didn™t 
really affect -- didn™t happen till some what later, but in 
looking back it™s that period which he -- obviously 
he could not look. But he ca -- but as time -- 
as the years went by, he me llowed -- not that we
 could talk about thes
e things, whereas my 
mother still retained the emotional problems wh
ich I suspect she experi enced having to wi -- 
watch this in a more active ro
le than I did, as a small boy. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So the -- whatever stor
ies then are from your mother, from the 
[indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
18 
 
 
A: Entirely from -- entirely answers to questions 
which I posed over a few -- period of few -- of a 
few years. Now, in England, when we had -- and 
we can come to that later, but in England, 
where we ultimately ende d up at, there again was 
not a Jewish community per se, and there were 
also a few other German refugees. Mostly wome n whose husbands had -- had -- had been left 
behind, or couldn™t get out, and they got together
 -- and because my moth
er was -- I was a small 
boy, and you -- you know, the days of leaving with 
babysitters was unheard 
of, so I was always 
carted around, and then put in a 
corner and given a book to read. So I would some time s  hear 
some  of these things which they would talk about
. And -- and of course all these things also got 
played out, so it was comme nts as a result, a
nd further comme nts, and answers to questions 

which my mother gave, among a group of three or f
our other ladies, some a 
little bit older, with 
no children, but in the same
 sort of situation. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So what -- what stories do 
you have of the voyage itself, that in -- 
A: My mother told me  -- well, apparently up to 
the -- up to the arri val in
 Cuba, it was -- it was 
very -- seemed to be very pleasant, in fact unbeli
evably, I me an, not that she said that, but when 
you read the background, you have to really ques
tion yourself. Here they are forced out of a 
country, and suddenly being, you know
, provided with -- with -- w
ith a staff, you know, waiters 
and everything else, at beck and call, considering 
what was taking place. Bu
t I think a great deal, 
from what I™ve read, or what I™ve heard, would i
ndicate that the captain of the St. Louis was an 
extremely decent individual, and dete
rmined to -- he was determined to
 -- to have this as if there 
was no -- no animosity against anybo
dy in particular. And I believe 
the -- the Israeli governme nt 
honored him with a -- with a -- with a me dal after th
e war, and I™ve also read that as a result of 
his activities, he was relieved of command when th
e St. Louis ultimately returned empty in --  in -
- to Germany. Never given another command, a
lthough he was a career naval officer from World 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
19 
 
 
War  
1
 days. But he was left alone, 
which is always again, you do -- 
you™d have thought he™d have 
been put on trial for being decent to Je ws. That 
did not happen. So I think a lot the -- the -- the 
way the -- the -- the staff and thecrew of the St. Louis conducted themselves, probably in my -- I 
can only surmise, was the way the captain felt they should handle themselves. So I think the 

voyage to Cuba probably was very pleasant. The 
voyage back from Cuba was not so pleasant. 
My -- my mother told me that things started 
to go downhill emotionally for people. And I -- I 
don™t know the name , I can™t recall 
the name of it, I™m sure it™s 
listed some where, there was one 
person who threw hims elf overboard in -- off the 
St. Louis in -- in -- in
 the harbor. I think, you 
know, t-trying to commi t  suicide, you know. And my
 mother knew the wi -- or had met the wife 
of -- of that ba -- if -- if --
 if my me mory is correct. Ya 
-- people talked among themselves 
some ti me s, but to what degree I don™t know. On 
the voyage back, they apparently had to have 

committees, which were -- the captain requested the 
me n to form, if they were willing, various 
committees which would -- which would sort of pa
trol  the decks, certain
ly during the night, or 
during the day and night, to avoid people from tr
ying to commit suicide, and my father -- my 
mother told me that my father was -- was a 
me mber of one of these committees. I don™t know 
what my gra ndfather, whether he was that way. 
It™s just that she res
ponded, or she me ntioned 
that to me, because there was serious -- a -- a 
serious thought by various pe ople that others would 
perhaps do this. Whether that™s right or wr
ong I don™t know, actuall
y. I™m not aware that 
anybody did do it, but there was that 
particular feeling. And of course there must have been, and 
I suspect, although my mother didn™t me ntion it,
 a tremendous apprehension as to what was 
going to happen, because if the sh
ip really returned to Hambur g again, then -- or wherever we 
sailed, the re -- the results w
ould have been extremely dire. 
Q: Sure. An-Anything else from the time in Havana, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
20 
 
 
A: We ll, we were never in Havana -- 
Q: Right, I know, in the harbor. 

A: You know, in the harbor. 

Q: Right. 

A: I don™t know whether the passengers at the 
time  kne w what was taki ng place, and I -- I-I™ve 
got to be careful here now in how I respond to
 you, because I could be ma king comme nts about 
what I™ve read. 

Q: Right. 

A: My understanding is that the 
Jewish relief agency in -- in the s -- in the United States was 
trying to negotiate -- 

Q: Release. 

A: -- the -- with -- with the mexi 
-- with the Cuban authorities, or
 the Cuban president, because I 
-- I gather  -- and this is only wh
at I™ve read, is that the -- the en
try certificates were not signed by 
the president, but they were sign
ed by Benito, if that™s the -- 
o-or whoever was the immigration 
mi nister, and were already ada -- you know, 
illegal documents, before we ever sailed. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Okay. And I don™t know whether -- what would 
have happened if people had known that. I™ve 
also read that one or two passengers, who had 
tickets, Jewish passengers, never believed these 
tickets were valid from the Ha mburg American line
, and went to the Cuban 
authorities in Berlin 
or whatever, and got landing vi
sas separately, on their own, befo
re they ever doc -- you know, 
boarded the ship. And the -- and 
th-these were people who were, 
in fact, allowed to land. But 
how far that™s accurate, I don™t know. I suspect 
-- I can only cou -- my mother certainly had no 
idea, and I could never ask my father, that, you k
now, they were not going 
to be -- and all I™ve -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
21 
 
 
to be allowed to land, and all I™v
e heard is that there were ne
gotiations on -- whether they knew 
that, on board, I don™t know. The vessel cruised up
 and down the -- the eastern seaboard. And I 
think that wa s done deliberately by the captain fro
m what I™ve read, in the hope that some thing 
would ma terialize. I gather it was really a nego
tiating tactic, with the -- 
again from what the -- 
what I™ve read or seen published, 
and that the -- the then pr esid
ent of the -- of Cuba couldn™t -- 
wouldn™t -- you know, wanted mor e  money and th
ere was a negotiating thing, and then suddenly 
the negotiation dropped down. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: What would have happened ha
d one lump sum been offer e d at that time, and they accepted, I 
don™t honestly know.  

Q: Right. 

A: You know, it™s very hard to 
determine at this juncture.  
Q: Right. 
A: Nobody™s alive today. I don™t know. 
Q: Right. The -- there™s sort of fa mous me mories
 about people being able 
to see the lights of 
Miami. Did your -- 

A: Yes, my -- my -- 

Q: -- did you mother me ntion that? 

A: -- my mo ther did me ntion that, yeah. It was 
close enough to do that, yes. But I presume that 
had to be on a clear night. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Okay. I mean, I don™t know. I 
don™t recall being taken out -- 
Q: But she did reme mber that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
22 
 
 
A: She reme mbered that, yeah.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, she reme mbered that, yeah.  

Q: Yeah. And did she have any -- did she talk 
to you about, you know, wh
at their daily routine 
was like?  Did they -- what they did duri
ng the day to pass the time, or do you know? 

A: The -- the half dozen photographs which I™ve di
scovered, or not even th
at, would indicate that 
people lou -- walked along the deck, lounged on th
e deck chairs, read books. That™s about all I 
can -- she didn™t discuss that in gr
eat deal -- and I have to be h
onest and say I don™t think I ever 
asked her what did you do all day long. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. But other -- and other than that
 incident when you got 
lost, you have no me mory 
of -- 

A: No.  

Q: -- of anything?  If it wa s -- 
A: None at all. I have to assume  that
 a -- life was rather  enjoyable for me. 
Q: It must have been, or -- if it was trauma tic -- 
A: You know, playing around with othe
r kids, and -- and not a problem. 
Q: Yeah, or otherwise you would reme mber, yeah.  

A: And -- and perhaps my parents -- we were obvi
ously all in one cabin, 
my parents and myself, 
and my grandfather in another ca
bin. I have to assume  that my  
parents perhaps ma de a point of 
not discussing these satter
 -- these matters in the evening or 
with myself in 
-- present, you know?  
Otherwise, perhaps I mi ght have remembered that. 

Q: Right. So the -- the ship eventually goes back across the ocean and -- 

A: Docks at ham -- at Antwerp. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
23 
 
 
Q: At Antwerp.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: Some  people get off there. 

A: Well -- 

Q: And apparently your parents ha
d a disagreement,
 I understand -- 
A: No -- 

Q: -- about where th
ey would get off. 
A: -- what happened was, from what my mother 
told me  is, when the ship docked, I think it was 
Antwerp, or we -- perhaps it happened before Antw
erp. My mother indicated to me  that -- that 
tables were set up on the deck of the St. Louis,  everybody but -- now then, 
at that juncture, knew 

that there we re a number of countries in Europe
, western Europe who were
 going to -- to take. 
My understanding was -- a th -- and my mother sa
id to me  there were tables set out. You know, 
table to England, table to France, 
table to Holland, takin -- table to 
Belgium, or whatever it was. 
And that you could -- you know, it wa
sn™t a lottery where name s were
 put into a hat. My mother 
said to me  that she perhaps, without ra -- you kn
ow, thinking and -- about 
it, said that she mi ght 
have been tempted, if it had been her choice, to 
try to go to France, because as a young teenager, 
her father had sent her with her brother to do 
a tour of Europe in the summe rti me. Lucky for 

them, they had the money to do it, and that sh
e™d gone to France, and she™d gone to Italy, you 

know, as a young teenager, perhaps in her seven -- at
 the age of 17 or 18, a
nd because of that -- 
and she™d learned French at school, not Englis
h [indecipherable] that 
that would have been, 
because she™d been there once or so, it would ha
ve  been nice. My father, apparently, pa id 

absolutely no attention to this, and wa lked to 
the English table, and sign up, for which there was 
not a -- initially, not a big dema nd. 
Now, my father could speak a 
little bit English. He ma de a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487

life and death decision, either comprehending a lit
tle bit of what mi ght happen, because war talk 
was already in the air, you have to reme mber
. We™re talking now begi
nning of June, okay, and 
war didn™t -- took place in September. 
Q: September. 

A: Okay. Perhaps -- and I™ve often pondered abou
t this myself, m- my -- my mother certainly 
couldn™t give me  an answer. And I thought mys e lf
, perhaps my father, from his four years in 
military expe rience, thought that perhaps being -- th-the 20 miles of channel mi ght be some  

diversion. I don™t really 
know. He made that decision, and ob
viously not one in which he was 
forced to do it, but voluntarily. And it was a life
 and death decision. So we then ended up in th-

the -- in Antwerp, okay. The St. Louis didn™t take
 us to England, another vessel took us, called 
the Rocosus, if I am not mi staken. My parents 
belongings, in these two co
ntainers and everything 
else, were offloaded from the St. Louis, th
e Hamburg American line, and dumped on the 
dockside. The Rocosus -- and I don™t -- and 
obviously was not -- I don™t know, it was not a 
Ha mburg American line, or it didn™t ma tter, woul
dn™t load them onto the boat to Southampton, 

they dema nded money. And my parents, or my 
father had absolutely no money. And so these 

containers rema ined behind. So other than our 
cabin luggage, which was put on board, all these 
things, and I just have often pondered what my 
parents thoughts were, se
eing these, and knowing 
what was in there -- 

Q: And the jewelry that she had sewn in -- 

A: We ll, that™s what my mother told me , yeah, ye ah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Which would have helped. And having no ability 
to -- to do anything, must have caused my 
father even bigger depression, I 
suspect, you know, or stunned silen
ce. We™ve -- I was able to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
25 
 
 
talk to my mother about this years later, and we
 just hope that if they were left there, that 
ultimately they got bombed. If they were taken to Germany when the Germans marched into 
Antwerp, and they were put into some German  storage houses, hopefully they got dama ged and 

burned, because they would never have know
n what they were sitting on. You know?  
Q: Right.  

A: So I -- I don™t know. We™re la
ughing about -- this wasn™t a 
laughing ma tter, I don™t doubt, at 
the time . 

Q: I™m sure, yeah. 

A: And then we took the boat to Southampt
on. We arrived in Southampton as far as I 

understand, and were taken by train. And this is 
really me mory -- not really such accurate 

me mory other -- you know, I™ve read about this. 
And we arrived in London. And we at -- we 
ended up in a s -- the four of us -- I™m includi
ng my grandfather now, Grandfather Eisner, my 

mother™s father, were put up eith
er in a two, or three,
 and I really don™t 
know -- certainly not 
more -- upstairs in a house, in a -- in a -- in 
an area of London called Camden town. The only 
thing which I really reme mber about this is th
at directly opposite the 
front of the house was a 
small park on the other side of th
e street, and that I -- my parent
s allowed me , or I was  able to 
play there. It -- it was in summertime , we arrived 
in June -- all the time . And I think that™s where 
I learned my  English. Very quickly, because when
 -- children have that
 ability, I think, if you 
follow what I™m getting at. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And obviously my pa rents were in no mood to 
sort of say to me , let™s go sightseeing, let™s do 
-- I™m sure they -- I don™t know why. So I was able 
to play there, and that
™s a recollection which 
I have, obviously a pleasant one. And I have to c
onclude that that™s where I learned English, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
26 
 
 
m- my -- my mother has said to me  that within 
about four or six weeks, I was fortunate enough -- 
and I then began to act as an interpreter -- 
Q: For them. 

A: -- for them, you know. Not with understanding, 
but to respond to the English questions an -- 
and so forth, if required, if required. I don™t know
 who really paid the rent, or provided my 
parents with funds, or my grandfat
her. My mother alway -- I -- I™m
 aware that the Jewish relief 
agency would -- did -- did provide
 some funds, but my mother al
ways spoke very highly of 
Quakers in -- in -- in England, and liberals. No
w, when I say liberals, 
I don™t think she meant it 
in the -- a political context, you know
, liberal being democrat or -- 
or -- or whatever. I think she 
meant liberal in the sense that th
ere were decent liberal people who 
felt that yo -- that either  part 
of their life was to be -- certainly not Jews, 
I -- I -- you know, the Jewish
 relief agency was doing 
one thing, Quakers obviously were -- were not Je
wish. I think she me ant 
decent liberal people 
who felt a -- a sense of -- of -- of desire to he
lp people who were in less 
fort unat e  ci rcumst ances. 
And she always talked very highly of that, and 
they provided some  means , but to what -- what 
extent I don™t know. But the Quaker thing, my 
mother always spoke 
extremely highly of. 
Q: What do you know about your father™s being ta
ken to the Isle of Man, your father and your 
grandfather? 

A: Oh, okay. We ll, I think I have to go
 a little bit -- back
 a little bit. 
Q: Okay. 

A: We were all together  until war was declar ed -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I-In September. You ma y be aware of the fact 
that after the war was d
eclared, the -- the -- the 
eng -- British governme nt ma de a suggestion that 
children in -- living in
 the London area mi ght

wish, depending upon their parents, to be boarded
 int -- more into the countryside. Be -- I 
suppose they assume d that London was going to be a ta
rget area. And they also said that mothers 
could go with them if they wanted to. Now how 
t hat was conveyed to my  parents, I don™t know, 
but that™s what happened to us. My mother and I 
went on one of these trains, together with other 
people re -- other ordinary pe
ople from lon -- from the London area. Nothing connected with 
Jews or Germans in any shape or form. And I 
don™t know exactly when, whether it was the end 

of the year, or the beginning of 1940, we ended 
up in a place called Bedford, which is 50 miles 
north of London. And we rema ined there ever si -- you know, my parents rema ined there ever 

since. Now, I don™t know when my father and my 
grandfather -- they weren™
t -- they never said 
they were arrested, they were interned. It
 was not like a German arrest, and it was not 

specifically geared to Jews. It 
-- all aliens. German aliens, and 
other ali -- I mean, other aliens, 
Austrian aliens, all connected with -- with Ge
rma ny, were imme diately rounded up, for want of a 
better word. Some  went to the Isle of Man, some
 went some where else. My father, and I believe 
my grandfather, went to the Isle of Man. In 
what particular month 
or -- or period, I™m not 
absolutely sure. It must have been -- I™m -- perh
aps end of sep -- end of 
™39, perhaps early ™40. 
Q: You™re not certain that
 your grandfather went -- 
A: No, I don™t -- I kno -- he was there, 
but I don™t know in what period of time. 
Q: Your grandfather? 

A: They were both together, interned there. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: And I™m not sure that they al
l turned up released. It
 was not over but -- for my father and my 
grandfather, I -- I get the impre
ssion it was not a long internment. 
And that™s the one thing which 
my father, he never referred to 
it as an arrest. He was able to 
comment to me  about that, and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
28 
 
 
said it was really like being in a barracks in th
e military, and I think he was tryi ng to compare it 
to World War 
1
. And he never spoke ill of that situati
on, and I suspect if you compare it to what 
happened in Buchenwald, there were -- you know
, there was no comparison whatsoever. I™m 
sure they were interviewed, perh
aps several time s, and I™m sure
 there mu st have been other 
German aliens, who may well have been German sp
ies, who lived in England for ma ny years, o-
or what have you, and they had to be weeded out.
 But I don™t recall my grandfather or my father 
ever me ntioning anything of what you would cal
l an ill nature. And, you know, the -- the fact 
that they were sleeping in a ba
rracks or -- or being in
terviewed, it was not in any shape and form, 
from what I gather, similar to what would ha
ve happened, or did happen in Buchenwald, and 
what subsequently happened. 
Q: Right. 

A: So I never -- and they certainly when I 
came out, there was no -- it didn™t look -- you know, I 
mean obviously it™s like being in an army ca m
p, but it wasn™t in any other way. And ultimately 
they both joined us in Bedford. When, I don™t kno
w, and where they came together, I don™t -- I 
can™t really recall. If 
it wa s 1940, then I was already five. And in those da ys, you went to school 

at the age of five in England. So
 my concern-- my ma -- mot her™s
 concern wasn™t getting me  off 
-- off to school -- and you have to reme mber, by this time  I was speaking English already, and it 

was not a long distance away, but 
again my mother spoke that th
e Quakers in Bedford, it was not 
a Jewish --

Q: Okay, this is a United States Holocaust Me
morial Museum interview with John Meyerstein, 
conducted by Nina Ellis on July first, 2004, in Wa
shington, D.C.. This is tape number two, side 
A. So we™re in -- it™s 1940 now. Your 
mother and you are living in Bedford. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And presumably sometime your father and 
grandfather come  back during that year. 

A: Yes, yeah, I don™t know exactly what -- when 
that year. The one thing which is interesting, 
the -- the -- the -- the German air raids on Britain
 at that time , had re
-really started, and I 
reme mber my mother had a school friend, some what
 older. I used to call her Aunt Margot. She 
was not ma r r ied, but she was more like a sister to
 my -- in other words they were school friends, 
but the relationship was almost 
like sisters, okay. And she had fa
 -- I can™t tell you how, but she 
got to London on her own, and she was living in
 London, and my mother apparently contacted 
her and said, ﬁ Why don™t you come  a nd live in Be
dford?  You can get a job in Bedford. And -- 
and come stay with me.ﬂ I think my mother 
was worried, you know, with
 the air raids, and 
nightly bombing, my father not there, my grandf
ather not being there. And so Margot Lewin, 
who had a brother in New York, a
nd was also, I think, hoping to get a visa to the States, which 
ultimately came  through, but not until World Wa r  
11
 was -- was over, and so
 forth, said all right, 
apparently, and -- and came  to Bedford, and ve
ry shortly got a job in a ma jor ma nufa c turing 
company, an ironwork company in Bedford, as
 a secretary. She obviously knew enough English 
to be able to do these things. A
nd she actually lived with us, and 
we all lived in one room. And I 
think it made my mother feel a little bit more 
safe and secure. I would 
call her Aunt Margot, you 
know, and she really became  more of an aunt th
an a real aunt would have been, if you follow 
what I™m getting at. And you know, we had nightly bombing raids at -- you know, some ti me s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
30 
 
 
two or three times during the nigh
t, and ri -- my mother -- my 
-- and we were living on the top 
floor of a -- of a building, of 
-- of a three story ap -- house, 
okay?  And my  mother -- you know, 
you get very tired when you have to get up and dr
ess and all the rest of
 these things. And my 
mother said to me  -- said to us, and I think it
 was a general agreement, not bu -- I mean, they 
didn™t ask for my approval, I was -- that they we
ren™t going to get up any 
more. If it was -- if -- I 
think my mo ther said if it was God™s will the bomb was going to go down, it won™t ma ke any 
difference if we™re upstairs or down in th
e cellar. It™s going 
to take us all. 
Q: Right. 

A: So we ended up just sleeping through all this
, not getting up any more. And we would be 
woken up by the air raid warning to say that this
 was -- the -- the planes 
were comi ng, or the all 
clear siren, when they were all gone. But, you know
, we just didn™t get up any more. My -- my 
mother just  ma de that decision, she sa id ge -- you
 kill yourself, I think -- or  we will -- we will -- 
we will die out of sheer exhaustion, you know, 
or I don™t know quite, you know, how it™s -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- anyway, they stayed -- they were -- they were 
ther e together, and if fact
 I visited my aunt in 
New York -- not -- she™s not my real aunt -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but if you understand what I mean, ma ny years 
later, as -- as a ma rried person, when I was 
already ma rried, and she in fact -- and I then bro
ught her from New York in
 -- in -- in a car. I had 
a business ve -- trip, and I drove to Ne w York 
for that specifically, picked her up from her 
apartment, drove her back to Canada, to Toronto. 
She stayed with us for two or three weeks, and 
then we put her on a plane back to -- to New York. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
31 
 
 
A: And you know, she was -- she was the type of 
aunt that, you know, if 
I needed pocket money, 
she was the one I would turn to. 
And years later, when I was in
 the army overseas, after I was 
drafted in England, she would write to me , and wh
enever she wrote, she would always put some  
money in from New York. So I was exchanging 
dollars. And she would al
ways put some  money 
in it -- she didn™t have an
y sons or daughters -- 
Q: Oh, I see. 
A: -- if you understand what I mean. 

Q: Right. 

A: She only had nieces, and -- and to her I 
was really her nephew in that context. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: She was that close to my mother, you see. 

Q: To your mother, right. That must have b
een a great comfort to 
your mother, to have a 
companion, sure. 
A: I think so. And it was a gr -- and -- and you know
, it was very nice. She was the type of aunt 
who was the accommoda ting type , in the sense that she ma de no dema nds on me . If anybody 
ma de any de ma nds, it was me  on her. And -- and sh
e was always obliging with -- with -- with so 
forth, so I have my -- my  me mories of her were 
-- were -- were very good. Then my fa ther was 
released from the Isle of Man, and at that junc
ture we obviously couldn™t
 live together. And then 
we -- we then moved to another -- 

Q: Because you didn™t ha ve enough space? 

A: No, well, we were in one room, a nd w -- a
nd my -- and -- and my mother™s school friend -- 
Q: Was there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
32 
 
 
A: -- was there. So we had to move, and it was -- a
nd we needed a bit more space, or wer -- we -- 
you know, the landlady was not exactly the greatest. 
I -- I don™t -- she was 
a -- she had a temper, 
I don™t mean that she was anti-Jewish, I think 
she was just a -- not a ve ry accommoda ting person. 

She rented rooms out to various other people. An
d I reme mbe r  my telling how that one of the -- 
there was an old ma n living on one of the rooms, 
and he said, ﬁDon™t take 
any attention to Mrs. 
Morgan, she™s just naturally irritable.ﬂ You know
?  So it wasn™t anything -- if -- if you understand 

me , it wasn™t anything bi -- against that. 

Q: Personal, yeah. 

A: She was just ma king money renting out rooms,
 okay. And -- but I think 
the rooms were -- bu -
- that money came in from either the Quakers, or 
other liberal people in th
e -- in -- in Bedford, in 
the sense of decent people, actually, until such 
time. And then at some  point, and I don™t know 
when, probably some time in the 40™s, my father
 came to Bedford, was released, so did my 
grandfather. We -- my mother ma de arrangements 
to move to another place where the three of us 
could be together, not far away from where we 
were staying. My -- she also ma de arrangements 
for my f -- grandfather to have a room by hi
ms elf some wher e, in another house. And Aunt 
Margot, quote, unquote, also got a ro
om for herself, and we went, 
and we progressed from there. 
My father then got a job. The one thing which I 
have always found very interesting is that we -- 
my parents did not, neither my father, my mother, or
 my grandfather, particularly after they ki -- 
were released from -- from the Isle of Man were
 not request -- did not 
have to go to the police 
station daily or weekly or monthly in any shape 
or form. And I gather th
at  that was a -- I -- I 
could be wrong, but I read some whe r e years late
r, that that was a decision ma de by Prime 
Minister Churchill to say, look, if we™ve checke
d these people out, let™
s not create a problem. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
33 
 
 
We™ve got more important things to do than wo
rry about having people go -- but whether that™s 
accurate or not, I don™t know. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But I™m not aware that my parents or my fath
er, or my grandfather had to report on a regular 
basis to the police. And we we
re left alone. Nobody ever bothered us. Nobody ever bothered us. 
In fact, it -- you -- it was perhaps typical En
glish, you™ve got your freedom, you™re on your own 

now. Which I found rather in
teresting in today™s context, wher
e immi grants in various countries, 
when they arrive, want -- ma ke de mands on all 
sorts of things. We  were just only too happy. I™m 
sure my parents, you know, depressed, stunne
d, whatever, but they were left alone.  
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: They did not have to worry
 about being knocked up in the 
mi ddle of the night by a police 
warrant or -- or what have you. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: And I think that -- I know from 
my father™s point of view, that that impressed him, years later. 
We didn™t actually talk about that, but I think he 
-- he -- his indication was 
that that -- that was 
something which made him, I susp
ect, feel a little bit better.  
Q: Yeah, I -- 

A: He was left alone. 

Q: -- my guess though, is that for a while -- it w
ould take you a while to relax, and even though 
you were in a safe community, to feel secure, es
pecially after what he
™d been through. Even 
though nobody was -- 

A: I think this is -- 

Q: -- bothering him.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
34 
 
 
A: I think you™re right. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But it mu st -- yeah, let me  -- I can -- I™ll gi
ve you a very funny situ
ation [indecipherable] I 
think you -- it™s -- it™s germane 
to what you™ve just said. We  
were 50 miles from London, and on 
-- on occasion some  -- during the war years, we 
would take the train to London, my mother and 
I, my father was working, just for a day™s outing.
 I mean here I™m still at school. I reme mber we 
were walking down -- this is quite clear to me -- 
walking down Oxford Stre
et , which is like Fifth 
Avenue in New York. It™s a bustling communit
y, you know?  It wasn™t exactly empty of people, 
even in war time. And s uddenly we saw, what
 my mother explained to me, an extremely 
Orthodox, pious Jew, with a beard and a hat, and 
I mean, the complete regalia. And my mother 
stopped to look around, and I had to
 stop and she said, ﬁLook at
 that.ﬂ And the only people 
stopping to look were my mother an
d myself, and I said, ﬁWell, wh
at is it? ﬂ And she said, ﬁBut, 
that™s an Orthodox Jew.ﬂ And I didn™t quite know 
what she meant at that time . Well I think 
afterwards, years later my -- I -- we talked abou
t this, my mother and I, is that it was so 
incredible, nobody paid the slightes
t attention. It was not an unnatu
ral event. They -- people just 
all were passing back -- my mother thought it was 
so unnatural in the -- in the context of what 
she™d left, to see this. For me , I didn™t really th
ink about this until years later, when I began to 
understand what she really meant. But I reme mb
er her saying to me , ﬁThat™s a very Orthodox 

Jew.ﬂ But I think she, a-as I say, she was wonde
ring whether people would accost hi m, or -- or  
affront him, or some thing. But he just walked
 on, and nobody paid the sl
ightest attention, other 
than ourselves. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
35 
 
 
A: You know. And other people must have looked 
at us to see [indeciph
erable] why were we 
turning to -- looki
ng at some body else? 
Q: [indecipherable]  
A: So that, I think, in answer to your comment, 
perhaps was the thing which ma y ult -- ma y have 
ma de my fat her -- my father never read a Germ
an newspaper any more. He only read an English 
newspaper. We talked in English and German, an
d as the years went by, we talked mor e  English. 
My father never wrote a letter to me , other 
than in English. Neither did my mother. Mind you, 
you have to reme mber I couldn™t, if they™d have 
written a letter in Germ
an I couldn™t have read 
it, because until I went to school years later, wh
ere -- where I had an option of learning -- I had 
to do French, but I also had an option of doing 
another foreign language, so I took German, but it 
was just school reading and writ
ing. And that just -- that™s ho
w it -- you know, my parents never 
talked to me  -- 

Q: It™s pretty rema rkable that, I mean, your fath
er was in his late 30™s,
 almost 40 years old by 
then. 

A: No, whe n -- in that period of 
time, my father was born in 1893 -- 
Q: ™93. 

A: -- so we™r e talking let™s say, in -- 

Q: He was almost 50 years old. 

A: That™s right.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: And I was a small boy, I mean, he could have had a grandson by that time . 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
36 
 
 
Q: And to -- you know, to turn away from his na
tive language at that age is quite rema rkable. 
A: We ll, yea -- this is a little bit off -- off the th
ing, but I think it™
s -- again it™s -- it
™s relevant to 
your question. Years later, when 
I had -- I made a business trip 
ma ny years later to Germany -- 
on bus -- you know, to -- for the 
business discussions. And I thought
, well I™ll bring him back a 
decent German newspaper, me -- meaning a quality
 pa -- newspaper. And I™ll -- and I sat in 
[indecipherable] bookstore, a book in
 German, which related to th
e -- to the period prior to 
World War 
1
, and I bought it, thinking that he would 
like it. He  barely scanned the paper. He 
looked at the book. I still have the book, I don™t have the paper, but
 I still have the book. And he 
looked at the book and the pictures
. I think the title of the book 
was sort of, you know, Ger many, 
pre-World War 
1
 days, you know, of how people lived a
nd so forth, which he would have 
understood. He scanned it, put it 
awa -- he never read a German book, you know, he -- it was all 
English books, history and everythi
ng else. And he -- that was a pe
riod he -- I don™t mean that he 
physically thought about it, and wi -- and ma de a -- an
 effort to show people,
 it just that he did 
not pay attention any more. He didn™t listen to
 Ge rman news casts on the BBC, it was always in 
English. Of course his English continued to impr
ove, as you can appreciate, but as far as he was 

concerned England for him was, I suppose the 
equivalent of heaven at that mo me nt. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: In relationship to what he™d experien
ced, because nobody ever bothered. They didn™t ask. 
English people generally, bit more reserved, so 
didn™t ask questions. And he
 wasn™t the type to 
want to answer, so he was just left alone. 
They thought he was a very nice person, he was 
courteous and pleasant, but he wasn™t forced to
 express himself to anybody. I think that ma de a 
ma jor differ e nce. 

Q: What kind of work did he get when he
 get when he -- when he [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
37 
 
 
A: We ll, he couldn™t practice law because Engl
ish common law, like American common law has 
absolutely no relationship to German law, so 
he could never practice his profession, and I think 
he was too old to -- to start all over again. You 
have to reme mber he™d been a judge, and he™d 
been a barrister. And there was no relationship, 
and w -- and we didn™t have the funds, anyway. 
And -- and so he took a job in a factory, a
nd you know, he -- but rea
lly, I suppose any job, you 
know, beggars can™t be choosers, to put food on th
e table, and pay the rent, and -- and -- and so 
forth, and th -- perhaps the one thing which one ca
n say is that  whilst he 
was free to do what he 
wanted, or was free to -- to live quietly, with
 nobody bothering him in En
gland, that didn™t me an 
that the English governme nt was going to help him get a job. 
Q: Right. 

A: Okay. 

Q: Did your parents ha ve much of 
a social life?  Were friends over, 
or visiting ot her people, or -- 
A: We  lived in a one bedr -- one bedroom apartm
ent with a little -- w
ith one gas ring. You don™t 
have people comi ng over, if you understand what 
I mean. We ™ d had mone y. For a long time we 

were -- my mother never had to do this, of course
, but I can still reme mber -- in fact, after my 
mother died, and I went through her personal eff
ects, I found the book -- she used to buy little -- 
little booklets, you know, and inside she daily jotted 
what she had bought in terms of groceries or 
so forth, because she had to ma ke sure that we had enough money for rent and so forth. She 

couldn™t stop herself afterwards, even when -- wh
en it wasn™t necessa ry. They -- it didn™t say I™m 
doing this. They [indecipherable] no, you know, I m
ean, it wasn™t exactly a happy thing when I 
went through these things. I -- I 
understood what she was about.  
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
38 
 
 
A: And if I asked for any money, she™d have 
to look through her purse and then check the book, 
and -- and say so forth, so no, we 
didn™t have -- yeah, people mi ght 
come  for a -- an hour or so, 
my -- my gr andfather would come  and -- and -- and 
so forth. But he didn™t have very much, and 
so my mother -- my mother had to go out to
 work as well, to do housecleaning for people. 
Mainly because t-to bring some 
money in. And my f -- my grandf
ather couldn™t work, he was too 
old, or it wasn™t possible. His English was 
not that good, so she would provide -- give him 
money for -- he was -- he smoked cigarettes an-a
nd -- and -- and so forth, but we didn™t -- to 
answer your question in a nutshell, did we have 
a social life?  No. I think my mother, she knew 
more people as a result of my going to school, becau
se she met other mothers in the process. But 
that wasn™t what you w
ould call a social -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- although those -- those -- those acquain
tanceships continued for ma ny years, if you 
understand what I™m getting at, but they were 
not really what you would call -- where people 
would socialize, invite each ot
her. We  didn™t have the funds and -- and m- my father certainly w-
would not have -- he was -- he was too -- he was wh
at I would call today in 
a clinical depression.  
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: That™s quite understandable. 

A: Yeah, and I think that that we
nt -- I didn™t realize that unti
l many years later, until I was an 
adult, and even then, it wasn™t until I got much ol
der that I -- I -- I begin 
to thi -- thought about 
this, and understand now. He went into depressi
ons at weekends more than during the week. And 
there were several times a -- I -- I 
rather think that my mother thought
 that he was going to try to 
commit suicide. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
39 
 
 
Q: Oh boy. 
A: He didn™t. But he would leave the house 
on a Saturday morning some times, you know, he 
worked from Monday to Friday. He™d get up in 
the morning, no breakfast -- this didn™t happen 
all the time , there were -- it was like a sort of
 periods, for no reason, and you have to reme mber 
his brother was still there, his mother was there.
 His -- his sister was in
 Australia, so that was 
okay. And he would go away. Now, we lived in a 
town where there was a -- a -- a river, was a 
very nice little country town, 
bit like Alexandria down the road, 
but a little bit broader, with 
bridge and a ma jor rive r running 
down, where every summer they™d have a huge regatta, and still 
do to this day. Think it was the th
ird biggest regatta in -- in E
ngland, and every year. And it was 
sort of three miles on one side of the embankme nt
, we™d call it, and three 
miles on the other. And 
in summertime it was very nice, with benches down
 there, and I -- I can reme mber they used to 
have a -- a ba ndstand, and you know, they™d pl ay 
military marches. I mean, that was to keep 
people™s spirits up, you know?  And he™d go out, and 
come  four o™clock, or
 so, 3:30, my mother 
didn™t know where he was. I don™t know why sh
 -- the population was what, between 50 and 
80,000. Still really not much more than 80 or 90,000 to 
this day. It™s the -- it™s the county town of 
-- of Bedfordshire. And I don™t know where my  -- 
where my mother got the idea that I would 
find him, and I didn™t know where to look, but 
perhaps it oc -- I don™t know why, it occurred to 
me  on -- once, that perhaps he mi ght want to 
go and sit down on the -- on 
the bench, and perhaps 
that -- I didn™t know where to go, up and down 
streets, you know, [indecipherable] find -- and 
sure enough I found him there. He
™d generally si t there on a be nch. He would just be  sitting 
alone. And I™d come  up, and he still wouldn™t talk, 
and I™d say, well it™s time  for -- for supper, 
you know, for dinner, or supper or some thing like th
at. Mom said it™s ready, you -- and he -- we -
- we got up and walked, but we 
didn™t talk. That happened on seve
ral occasions. I don™t me an, ru 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
40 
 
 
-- you know, every other month. That happened on 
several occasions over a period of about -- 
perhaps between nine and 11 or so. And severa
l, I don™t mean a huge amount, perhaps two or 
three or four times. 
Q: But over time, enough for you to -- 

A: But that actually woul
d da -- yeah -- no --  
Q: -- understand that was going on for 
[indecipherable] period of time. 
A: -- I didn™t really quite know
, no, I just thought my father was a moody individual -- 
Q: Yeah, at the time you wouldn™t know. 

A: -- I mean, I -- I real ize, of course, it wasn™t actually. 

Q: Right. 

A: But that gradually eased to the point th
at eventually that never happened any more. 
Q: What was it like for you in school?  Did you ha
ve any particular trouble in school, or -- 
A: Yeah, the first school I went 
to was like a -- like a 
typical public school here, you know, grade 
one, two. Two -- I think grade -- grade one we went
 in at five, and then at age 10 you went onto a 
-- what would be the mi ddle school, or some thing 
like that, okay. Yeah, I did, but it wasn™t an 
anti-Jewish thing, it was because of my na 
-- m- my Ger man surname. I me an, John was, 
everybody understood that, and I™d occasionally get called, you know, German sausage or 

some thing like that, you know, but I mean thes
e things happen. And you know, there was a time 
when I was probably having a fistfight, but not 
because it was anti-Jewis
h. I™d reached a point 
where I wasn™t going to take this
, or couldn™t take this any lo
nger. And you know how kids are, 
they can bully. Now you ha -- you -- you either 
come  to a conclusion that you have to -- you 
have to face this up, and -- and I 
ne ver discussed this with my parents, you know. There wasn™t 

much point, my father was working, my moth
er was working, he was going to, you know -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
41 
 
 
Q: What are they going to do, right. 
A: -- and but you know, there was a -- there was a pe
riod where I sort of had regular fights, but it 
was -- but I wasn™t the only one having these, th
ese characters were doing 
this with other kids 
that -- you know, for whatever reasons. And it re
ached a point where ultima tely, I mu st have 
obviously defended mys e lf on my own sufficiently, 
that you become  friends with the bully, and 
years later we would say hello to each other. Y
ou know, bullies, when they get take n on straight 
in, and not backing off as well, they go to the -- to
 the weakest. I think it 
was really a choice of 
either taki ng a -- a whacking each time , or ha
ving to try and see if you could defend yourself, 
and I -- I -- I -- I™ve told my wife this, I had to
 know I -- whether I -- 
whether I hit and bit and 
kicked to the point where they 
didn™t want that happening, and gr
adually, over a period of time, 
th-that was left alone. That didn™t continue
 indefinitely. But it 
was no -- I suppose a bit 
understandable. Meyerstein, that™s a Germ
an na me , Ger man sausage, you know?   
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  
A: You know, not a Jewish thing, because you k
now I don™t recall having
 that -- that --  
Q: Right, right. You me ntioned earlier that while
 your father was at the 
Isle of Man, and you and 
your mother and your mother™s friend were there 
in Bedford, living on the third floor, did bombs 
ever drop in your neighborhood? 
A: Yes. 

Q: They did? 

A: They did. When we moved -- 
when we moved to -- you have to reme mber this is not a big -- 
Bedford was not a big town. Lewton, which wa
s 20 miles away, was the home  of Ge neral 
Motors, okay, but Bedford was the hub of a -- had a 
ma jor railway station, it was a hub area for a 
lot of trains comi ng in and out, and I think th
ey were always trying 
-- and about 20 mi nute -- 15 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
42 
 
 
mi nutes away by car, was the intake for all th
e RAF -- Air Force personne
l, enteringthe -- the 
RAF, you know, if you understand what 
I™m getting at. So there were -- 
Q: Targets. 
A: Targets. And some times, of course the -- the 
-- the air raid warnings 
would come  on if they 
heard planes flying overhead, even if they were
 not been a target, Bedford. And there was one 
occasion, not when we were on the third floor, bu
t when we were on the second floor m -- of my 
-- just before my father came to join us, I -- I 
think, cause that™s the time  we would have moved 
there, there was one really ma jor bombing rai
d, and they were obviously
 going for the railway 
tracks. And the landlady and my 
mother, and I -- and this wasn™t
 a big house, all got up and -- 
and we went into the living room, and you know, 
they had these old antiq
ue dining tables, round 
dining tables, you know, solid, you w
ould probably need six people to
 lift them. And I  reme mber 
my mother pushing me under the table, and she 
and the landlady got underneath, because the fe -
- the -- the -- I think the f
eeling was, if the ceiling was co
mi ng in, the table was thick enough, 
and heavy enough to absorb this. But nothing ha
ppened, other than the house shook. But there 

were time -- but you know, you get used to it. Y
ou know, I don™t say that that™s a great way of 
getting used to things -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but we got used to -- you can™t 
panic, that™s -- what can you do? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And there were one or  two occasions when I 
would walk to school. In fact, my da ughters both 
called me  at the time  after 9-11 [i
ndecipherable] and they were livi
ng there in the States, and said 
to me , ﬁDad, what happened when you were a yo
ungster?ﬂ You know, and I said, ﬁWell, I went 
to school.ﬂ And I said, you know, Grandma wa
s working, Granddad was working, and I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
43 
 
 
closer to school than anywhere 
else, what was I going to do to get home, I couldn™t have got in 
anyway. I didn™t have a f -- a key. So I just ra
n on to school, but I mean, what can you do?  You 
know, they™re high up in the sky, you know. For youngsters
 some ti me s that™s -- it™s a bit of an 
adventure. I -- I don™t mean to de
mean that, your question or answer. 
Q: Of course. 

A: This didn™t happen every day. But, I mean, 
you get used to it. What could I do anyway? 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Ya -- you -- I think people ha
ve to le -- do learn to contro
l panic now, obviously some  people 
ma  -- take it more seriously than anything 
else. But this wasn™t a daily occurrence. 
Q: Right. 

A: But people do -- it was a war time, that™s why 
when I me nt ioned it, I thought my father was 
very heavily depressed. In today™
s context, that would probably 
be referred to for di -- for 
me dical reasons. You have to reme
mber Britain was the only country
 left in Europe, alone, and a 
-- a -- America didn™t come into Wor l d War 
11
 until ™41, after Pearl Harbor . And that was 
towards the end of ™41. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So, you know, people didn™t have time to 
worry about were you depressed or --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- or worried. They had far more worries on 
their mi nd. I know that my mother -- if anything, 
my mother™s worry, where we stayed. W- We lived in
 this place that she -- the landlady was very 
pleasant. Her name  -- Mrs. Duncan, I reme mber 
her name . And she had a -- her son was a pilot 
flying Mosquito bombers over Germany, and my  mo
ther was always terrib
ly afraid that if 
some thing happened to him, Mrs. Duncan w ould turn on my mother, you know, he didn™t, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
44 
 
 
know. I -- I don™t know [indecipherable] she was ve
ry concerned. But I reme mber one day -- my 
mother told me  this, and I would have been, 
well, around six, yeah. One day my mother was at 
home , and there was a knock on the door, and a young 
army officer bi -- was at the door, and my 
mother opened the door, and he saluted her a
nd said, you know, ﬁIs Mrs. Duncan in?  Mrs. 
Duncan?ﬂ And my mother said,ﬁS
he™s not in.ﬂ And he said, ﬁO
h, could you tell her, I™m her 
nephew.ﬂ You know, also in the military, but in the army side, you know? Saluted her, and wal -- 
and said, di -- ﬁWould you let her know I passed 
by, I™m on leave,ﬂ or some thing like that. ﬁShe 
knows where I am.ﬂ And [indecipherable] for my 
mother to understand. But I think my mother 

could never get over the fact that
, you know, if it had been a German
 offi cer, he would have sort 
of kicked the door, or -- or I don™t 
know whether -- what she assume d. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It™s just she couldn™t understa
nd the courtesy with which -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- she was wi -- she wa s treated, you see. No, so
 that was a sample of 
little -- little me mories 
of -- of -- of which I have. 
Q: Right. Do y -- 

A: They both survived, and I me t them years late
r as I was growing up a little bit, actually, you 
know. 

Q: Oh. Do you have any r-recollection 
of the end of the war? V-E day? 

A: We ll I -- no, my rec -- not 
really, you know my r
ecollections of D-Da
y were greater -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- because when you look -- well, for the simple reason that when you went to school -- and 

whe -- when I got up in the morning, there 
was a ma ss -- and looked out the window, we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
45 
 
 
couldn™t help it, the planes were enor -- cons
tantly, the sky was full of planes, so everybody 
knew some thing was happening. That, to me , was 
far more -- far more -- you know, I mean, the 
place was dark with planes, 
all going in one direction. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. So, yo -- and -- and I bet that 
you -- your father probably followed that very 
closely in the papers, an
d I™m sure everybody did -- 
A: Mm, yes, yeah. 

Q: -- at that  -- at then -- in those time s 
it was quite -- quite mo me ntous for everyone. 
A: Yes, I think he did, yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I -- I would imagine so. We didn™t discuss it, 
I don™t recall that -- I -- 
th-the one thing which, 
again, which is interesting in the context of how 
one views refugees today, when we arrived in 
England, they -- and I have these docume nts still,
 or booklets, wa -- they -- I don™t know whether 
wh -- whether the Jewish agency gave them out, or 
whatever. They just sa id to the --  to th --  
everybody got them, and I found them just recentl
y, that, you know, don™t congregate together -- 
and they™re in engla -- in English, but to -- I 
think to German refugees in particular, don™t 
congregate together, don™t speak loudly, don™t sp
eak in German. Keep -- keep your head down, 
and -- and -- and pay attention to what™s going 
on, and -- and go about things, and do your work, 
and -- and don™t get in a -- don™t cr
eate problems. And I be -- perh
aps I™m a little cynical, and I 
view other refugees, you know, wh-who come  to ot
her countries and almost dema nd -- perhaps 
an exaggeration, but expect things to be ha
nded over. My parents didn™t expect anything. 
Some times I wonder, when I look at this and sa
y to myself, you know, we 
were [indecipherable] 
they did what -- they did that, they -- they 
kept away from public -- you know, they wouldn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
46 
 
 
have gone out in the streets to celebrate, because fi
rst of all, with accents, 
they would have had to 
explain themselves, they were
 just probably thankful.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: But that didn™t rea
lly mean verymuch. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Because at that juncture, my father pr
obabl y wouldn™t have known what happened to my 
father -- to my mother -- to his mother, and to
 his brother. No idea, you see. Although we had 
Red Cross letters from my grandmother, up to 1942. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And -- but he had no idea, he -- in 1939, when we -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: I™m going to ask you to star
t again with th
e telegram.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: This is a continuation of the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John 
Meyerstein, this is tape two, side
 B. You -- you were me ntioning -- 
A: In 1939, from what I understand, from what my
 mother told me, my
 fatherreceived a 
telegram from his -- from his brother Hugo, pres
umably in ger -- in Germany, I -- I™m not -- I 
assume  so, or from some where, saying can 
you do anything to help me ?  He was ma rried, no 
children. Well, my father had no mo ney, and no influence, no way -- and wouldn™t have known 

where to turn, let alone anything else. So pres
uma bly that cable never got answered. I don™t 

know where the cable is, I™ve never seen 
it -- you know, I™ve not found it among the papers. 
Q: It must have been a heartb
reaking thing for your father. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
47 
 
 
A: Exactly. The other thing, of c
ourse, you have to understand is that my father had the problems 
of his mother and his brother. My mother 
and my grandfather had the problems of the 
grandmother, you know, my mother™s mother. 
Q: She was still there, she was still there. 

A: My f -- my mother™s brother, Lota Eisner wa
s also at Buchenwald, also got out, and we me t 
each other in London before the war started. And he
, for some reason or  other, got a permit to go 
to Palestine. How it happened, I™ve no idea, he ne
ver explained it to me. We met years later and 

he -- I -- I™ve spoken to his children, my cous
ins, they don™t know how. And he went to 
Palestine, and ended up in the British army, jo
ined the British army. My m -- the --  I -- my 

mother tells me that the reason -- or  told me th
e reason that her mother didn™t leave wa s that he 
hadn™t left before we™d left. So 
she was concerned that her only son would be left behind, so she 
wasn™t going to go, so she put -- forced my f -- ha -- my grandfather to go with us, but she wou -- 

didn™t come. I don™t know, it -- it 
-- it™s a strange story, okay? 
Q: It is interesting, yeah. 

A: And I™ll include this to you because I think yo
u™re going to find this rather interesting. She 
was left behind, but her son got out
 before the World Wa r. Well -- 
Q: Right, say -- say her name  again. 

A: Her name was Rosa Eisner, okay?   

Q: Right, Rosa Eisner. 

A: She™s in Gutentag, still 
in her own home , hadn™t been 
confiscated or anything, you know. 
Now war wa s declared in ™39. We  were all out, 
she was alone. That must have been a real 
problem for my father -- for my
 mother, and for my grandfathe
r, with no means to do anything 
any more. Pondering, I suppose, and no communication, as far as I know. She got out on a vessel 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
48 
 
 
which sailed from the Baltic during the war. 
Whe n exactly, I don™t quite
 know. I don™t know the 
name  of it, I know it™s in the Holocaust -- Holo
caust Museum, people know about it. It sailed, 
and ultima tely ended up with all refugees, the pl
ace was packed to the gunwales, I gather, with 
refugees. I don™t know who the skipper was, it wa
s not a -- I don™t know, from some  --  I don™t 
know. Anyway -- or how the crew was hired, or 
what have you. It was li
ke a tramp vessel, I 
suspect. It ended up in Haifa wate
rs. They didn™t want to let it enter, so the vessel bl ew it itself 
up. My grandm -- mothe r  was on deck when th
ey blew it up, had no idea this was going to 
happen, they didn™t tell anybody. I m
ean, that th-the -- the Jews d
ecided it™s the only way they™re 
going to have to get ashore. So they blew itsel
f up, the vessel started to sink, or capsize. My -- 
my grandmother told my  mother, and my mother
 told me , they -- and even my cousins don™t 
know the full story. My grandmother was thrown 
overboard. She was on deck luckily, not below 
deck or anywhere. And couldn™t swim, and the ca
ble, as the ship was turning over, cable came 

down -- you know, these things don™t happen in 
seconds, and she hung onto this, and you know, 
of course, as soon as the vessel bl ew itself 
up, the military all came out to pick everybody up, 
you know. Picked her up, you know, and picked up 
the survivors or some thing, and put them 
into a military barracks. God knows 
how -- I don™t know, she said my name  is so and so, I have a 

son who is in Palestine. They checked the reco
rds, found he was in the 
Br itish army, contacted 
him, and said get here, is this your mother?  Hegoes down to the barracks as his -- my mother 

explained, to where they were all interned. I me a
n, it™s like a barracks, I me an, with clothing and 
stuff like that. And he says, ﬁYeah, that™s my mo
ther.ﬂ And they said, ﬁTake your mo ther and go, 

and don™t come  back.ﬂ  

Q: Unbelievable. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
49 
 
 
A: Yeah. So that™s another story, so we all surv
ived, in that context, except my grandmother on 
my father™s side, and my 
father™s brother, you know. 
Q: Right. 
A:  But  t hat™s a di ffere
nt story altogether. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we didn™t discover that 
until years later. My cousins, 
to this day, don™t quite know how 
this happened. Now, why my grandm
other left, and this is perhaps 
an even stran -- 
equally story, 
they were in Gutentag. It was a predominan
tly Catholic communit
y, not a big community, 
Gutentag was not a big -- you would hardly fi
nd it on the ma p, and I don™t know what the Polish 
name  is now. The -- a very rural farming commun
ity, which is why I think my grandfather must 
have -- or his father actually
 st arted the business, this -- 
Q: Farm i mplement. 

A: -- farm implement, you know, which grew in
to quite a sizable establishment. And everybody 
spoke Polish. The farming -- th-the Poles, alt
hough they were German -- born on German soil, 
still predomi nantly ethnic Poles, okay. I think 
Si lesia was taken by the ger -- Prussia in 17 -- 
mi ddle of the 1700™s or so. Anyway, predomin
antly Catholic. My mother™s there -- my 
grandmother™s there alone, as my mot her -- moth
er explained to me , and 
the Catholic pr iest  -- 
there™s a na -- come  -- in the mi ddle of wint
er, and I don™t quite know when, ‚40 perhaps. 
[indecipherable] must ha ve been, perhaps ‚40, I pr
esume. Yeah, would have been -- would have 
had to be ‚40. Ag -- dub -- my -- as I understand it, 
and this is what my 
mother [indecipherable] 
it, there was a knock on the back door, and you ca
n -- must have been after dark. So you can 
imagine that must have been a major shock to
 my  grandmother, you know, in the -- to get a 
knock -- it™s bad enough to get a knock on the fr
ont door, but to get a knock on the back door. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
50 
 
 
She opens the back door, and it™s the parish priest
. He come s in, they™re all in darkness. He says, 
ﬁDon™t put on the lights.ﬂ And says, ﬁYou know, th
e Gestapo is comi ng tomorrow morning t- to 
arrest you, or to pick you up.ﬂ He had obviously hear d this from either his 
parishioners, or some  
who were in -- who were Catholics, but were in 
the Gestapo or whatever. Ye -- ye -- there were 
Germans there as well, but it was a predom
inantly Catholic community, okay. And you -- you 
better be going. Yo -- I suggest 
you -- you -- you™re not here.  
Q: Wo w. 
A: And -- and don™t le -- when -- 
and they talked for a few mo re mi nutes I presume, or for 
whatever period of time, and then he left again by
 the back door. Apparent
ly then -- no lights on, 
you know. So apparently she -- it was 
in wintertime, so she got on -- 
a-as my mother explains it, 
she dressed in my father -- grandfather™s trouser
s, heavy sweater and ever
ything else. It™s snow 
on the ground. And -- and in those 
days people had th -- what they
 call rucksacks, what we call 
these little -- 
Q: Backpacks. 
A: Backpacks, actually. As much as she coul
d pack together, take whatever she could 
[indecipherable] docume nts, money, whatever she ma
y have had, and in the mi ddle of the night, 
walked away. 

Q: Geez. Geez. Alone, she™d been alone. My goodness. Woul d you like to take a br eak?  Yeah 

[break] Art e v -- 

A: Okay. 

Q: And so where -- we™ve talked about the war is over -- 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
51 
 
 
Q: -- and you™re in school, your parents wo
rking. You -- you graduated from high school 
[indecipherable] 
A: No -- well, not -- not in a 
different way. I -- I can give you a 
better an -- a -- a different a-
answer to that. M-My father™s ma in concern was 
to ma ke sure that -- always was I would have 
the best  education he  could possibl y provide, whic
h was pretty limited in those days because we 
didn™t have the money. Now, Bedford had a --
 was a small community of between 50 and 80,000 

people, and it™s not much more than 80,000 or 90 
at the most today. But it had a reputation for 

having the two -- in England they call them public
 schools, but they™re like private schools, of 
the Ivy League type, and two girl
™s schools like this, and a convent,
 which went up to university 
level. And ma ny peopl e sent children as boardi
ng children to these schools, because  of the 
educational -- Bedford had a reputation for havi
ng an excellent educational system, a private 
educational system. And my father, having no mo ne
y, nevertheless, wanted to see if he could do 
the same -- give me that -- or give me that oppo
rtunity, and we nt to see the headma ster, or the 
principal of one of these two boys
 public schools, there were no gi
rls, I mean, they™re separate 
actually. These are both Anglica
n, high Anglican schools, if y
ou understand high Anglican in 
that cont ext. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The principal was in fact, an Anglican priest, 
but a teacher as a career
, but had -- but had also 
been a -- had also become  a prie
st. And my father had a private 
interview with hi
m, I understand, 
explained the circumstances. The principal said, 
send your boy in. If he takes a test like anybody 
else and passes it, we -- it woul
d -- it™s -- it wa -- it was one of
 these schools which had a great 
alumni, which -- 

Q: Endowment. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
52 
 
 
A: -- yeah, and it was a 400 year old school. I pa
ssed the exam, which I don™t think was that high 
a standard, nevertheless, and at
 the age of 10 in 1940 -- in -- 11
 in 1946, I entered the school. I 
used to walk to school every day, I wa s a 
day boy, and the school never sent a bill. 
Q: Wow. What was the name of the school? 
A: The school was called Bedford Modern School. 
It was first chartered in, I think, 1566 by then 
Lord Mayor of London, who had been born in Bedf
ord. The school still inhe
rits the -- the rents 
from the land which this for mer Lord Mayor en
dowed to the school, together, so that™s where 
they get all these -- you know, the o 
-- the -- plus the -- the other al
umni scenario, and not a word 
was ever me ntioned or raised. 

Q: Wo w. 

A: And nobody was dis -- it was never 
discussed in the school, and -- 
Q: You weren™t singled out in any wa y? 

A: Never singled out in any way. 
Q: Hm. Fabulous.  
A: And I think there were about -- in total about
 two or three other Jewi
sh boys at the school. If 
you -- if you did not want  to attend an-and that wa
s the type of school where it still does, I think. 
Well, I™m not sure whether it does it any more now. The school had about a thousand -- between 

700 and a thousand boys at all time . Every morning 
at nine o™clock, the ha
ll was filled with a -- 
this is really -- and you™ll find this interesting 
-- was filled with the boys and the masters. Th-The 
-- the headmaster, the principal, would walk
 with cap and gown, ev
erybody [indecipherable] 
ma sters in caps and gown, would walk through 
the center of the hall, and the whole school 
would ri -- ri -- stand up bec -- in -- in cour
tesy to the headma ster, and he would go up on the 
dais, and then there would be a small readi
ng, and a small two or three mi nute sermon, some  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
53 
 
 
discussions, and a prayer which act
 -- ironically was always interdenominational, it di dn™t really 
have any great things, and then it™s [indeciphe
rable] been, you know, after that was done -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- and if you wanted to attend, you could. If -- nothing was ever said if you didn™t wa nt to 

attend. Everybody did. We all did. Cause there wa
s really no reason not to. There wa s -- you 
know, we -- and nobody ever attempted to proselyti
ze, or to try and convert, it was just -- 
became a matter of courtesy that we all a
ttended. And -- and I mean, nobody knew who was 
who. 

Q: Right. 

A: If you understand what I mean. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I™ve gone back, visited the school from 
time to -- I mean, in odd years over the years, 
and -- and -- and they™ve told me  that they so
me times find parents who -- who™ve come in and 
said -- cause now the fees have gone up much hi
gher than they are a -- and I said, ﬁWhat happens 
if parents can™t meet the fees
?ﬂ You know, and he said well, we
™ve had some  [indecipherable] 
one of the bursars in the school, 
not now any mo re, but about 10 y
ears ago was in my class. And 
he, for some  reason decided that he ™d continue 
to do these things. We  -- so we knew each other 
on first name  terms. And he said to me , well, 
he said, that™s actually
 happened, with this 
downsizing, rightsizing, outsizi
ng thing in the late -- 
in the 80™s, early 90™s, and so forth. And he 
said, but we -- we just  told pare
nts the endowme nt will take care of that until such time  as you™re 
in a position to. So the school still continues that. 

Q: Has that traditi
on, that™s wonderful. 
A: Yeah, as a tradition.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487

Q: I say high Anglican, only because the -- the 
-- the principal was a high Anglican, a -- a -- you 
know, a priest. And he™s the one, when you got to th
e last two years of sch
ool, he -- he -- w-we -- 
they -- they had the what they would call Divini
ty class, 40 mi nutes once a week. But his -- and I 
did attend it, and we all did. It 
wasn™t a religious conversion, it
 was a discussion of religious 
philosophy. And each student in a cla
ss had to -- in -- in alphabetical
 or de r, had to take the notes 
so that they could be -- and 
they would have to stand up and 
-- and repeat that the following 
week to the princi pal, the headma
ster, to bring him up to date as to what had been discussed the 
last time. Did you understand what I™m getting at? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And it became -- so if I had to do it, there 
was some body else there the next week, that -- 
sitting next to me , taking, ma
king sure -- they would have to
 stand up and take the notes. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And you had to do that -- it was his Divinity 
course, but it was really
 courses in religious 
ethics for 40 mi nutes once a week. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: Years later, when he retired, I came  back. 
M y parents were living in
 England, I was ma rried, 
already had a daughter, and I was working overseas
 and was a me mber of the Rotary club. And 
for some  reason or another my -- I met some body 
from the school who was in fact involved in 
the Rotary club. And the priest of 
another parish on this little outsk
irts of the town, who had also 
been to --  to the school, but much earlier than 
I, but who was the person in charge of getting 
speakers, somehow or another was gi ven my name
, and wrote me  a little note, and said, ﬁWould 
you mi nd speaking?  You -- I -- we understand yo
u™re working overseas, could you -- would you 
like to talk on this one?ﬂ And so
 I said yes, and he said, ﬁOh, by the way, the Reverent J.E. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
55 
 
 
Taylor,ﬂ you know, he™s retired, he™s your 
-- your -- your headma st
er, you know, ﬁhe is a 
me mber of our club, and he ha
s volunteered to introduce you.ﬂ 
Q: Oh, how great. That™s great, yeah. 
A: And the -- what was even more interesting is
 they had the local me mbe r  of Parliame nt for 

Bedford, turned up that day, who happened to be th
e former -- former Chur
chil l  -- former Pri me 
Minister Churchill™s son-in-law, 
and of course I ended up getti
ng preference. He sat, you know, 
on one side, but th -- they weren™
t -- this --  they weren™t there -- 
he wasn™t there to give them a 
speech -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- you know, just I wa s there to speak for 20 mi nut
es, and -- and the -- and the -- th-the -- that 
the -- that my for mer headma ster, principal, you 
know, spoke very -- ma de no reference at all to 
how my father mi ght have come to see him or some
thing, other than that this
 is one of my for mer 
students, and he did this and this
 and this and this and is now th
is, and I™m delighted to introduce 
him. 

Q: Interesting, interesting. 

A: You know. 

Q: Huh. Yeah. You graduated from there? 

A: Yes.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: In the -- in 19 fo -- I -- I graduated in 19 fift 
-- I went to school in ™46, 
to this particular school 
I told you about, graduated in 1953. In 1948, my fa
ther became a British citizen, my parents 
became British citizens. Because my father became
 a British citizen, that automatically made me 
a British citizen, I did not have
 to apply, I was a mi nor, did not
 have to apply, okay. But on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
56 
 
 
documents, I became. That meant that at the age 
of 17, I had to regi ster for draft. Now, in 
England in those days, the draft continued I think 
until some time of the 60™s. Britain was in the 
same boat as America is now. Whene ver there 
was a call to do some thing, they had to send 
troops. And in -- at the age of 17, 
it was published in the newspapers
 that in alphabetical order, 
dates and so and so, and you went to the near
est ma npower office, and 
you registered, okay. And 
you s -- you explained where you were, what you 
were doing, were you at school, when did you 
anticipate leaving school, did you plan to go on earl
y -- to further studies? If so, when and how. 
And you had to do this, it was a ma ndatory call up
 for all ma les between the ages of 17 and a 
half and 35. Now you could have defe rments, but
 you couldn™t get out of it unless you were a 
Conscientious Objector, okay. And then you had to -- you would have had to go before a 

tribunal, and that whilst -- th
ey wouldn™t have let you off, but
 you could have [indecipherable] 
away for that. So at the age of 17 and a half, as 
I say, I -- I had to regi st
er. And I never finished 
my last day at school, because at my last day of
 school, I went to a -- I to
ok the train to another 
balan -- 40 mi nutes away to another community, wh
ere I was -- I™d been sent documents, this for 
my medical exam, because I had mentioned that I 
would leave in -- in July
 19 -- or I -- I -- in -- 
in ju -- in -- in 1953 I would be 
leaving school, and I™d ma de the deci
sion not to -- to -- to do the 
call up earlier than later, not really u
nderstanding the consequences of I --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- about what that would really mean. So I ne
ver finished the last da
y of school. Did the call 
up, where you have an interview, and they ask y
ou what you™d like to do, would you like to go in 
the army, would you like to go in the navy, would 
you like to go in the air force, and I said, 
ﬁWell I™ll -- I™d like to go in the ar my.ﬂ I think 
really because my grandf
ather, on both sides, my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
57 
 
 
father, his brothers, my uncle, all been in the 
ar my, so I -- it was -- it was like it was like a 
tradition. It was now my  turn. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I said army, and the fellow said to me , 
the -- the interviewing officer, obviously a retired 
serving officer, said, ﬁMo -- any 
-- any particular preference?ﬂ 
And I still reme mber this, and I 
laugh about it. I must have been quite arrogant in
 [indecipherable] days, and I said I™m here -- I 
am now, you know, it -- I™d -- I™d turned 18 now
, understand. I said, ﬁI™d like to go in the 
Intelligence Corps.ﬂ And he said, ﬁWell, why 
would you like to,ﬂ -- you know, ﬁwhat ma kes you 
say the Intelligence Corps?ﬂ And I said, ﬁWell,
 I studied Latin and French at school, and I 
thought I was pretty good, you know. And he 
nodded, and didn™t say anything. And you know, a 
few days -- a couple -- two or three weeks later, I 
get a letter and it says report to the follow -- to 

the infantry unit in my -- in my home tow
n. You know, which -- so obviously, if I had said 
infantry, I mi ght have got in
to the Intelligence Corps -- 
Q: Intelligence. 

A: -- but here, that™s how the military sometimes worked. It di dn™t matter, okay. My mother was 

not terribly happy about this. My 
fa -- and -- and -- and me ntion this, and said she was going to 

call -- you ha ve to reme mber my par e nts are now Br
itish citizens, and sa -- so my mother said 
she was going to -- didn™t like this one bit, 
because it was a pr etty 
sure thing -- I wa -- 
[indecipherable] it was pretty -- there was a good 
likelihood that I™d be sent overseas. You know, 
Britain was involved in -- in -- in Germany, Midd
le East, the communist upr
isings in -- in -- in -- 
in Malaya at that time, which was British te
rritory. The Korean war, you know, where Britain 
had, as is normal these days, when America calls -- 

Q: Britain follows.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
58 
 
 
A: Britain usually ca -- Britain
 usually accedes, and sends in troops as we ll. Quite a strange, 
rema rkable situation. Painful for 
a lot of people, no doubt, I don™t --
 I expect, but it seems to be 
that way, and was then. But it was Br itain really 
in the ma jor role, and not quite the other way 
around. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So my mother, I think, was very concerned, 
and said she was going to
 call the Member of 
Parliame nt. Now, I don™t know whether she meant 
that, or whether she really was trying to 
express her irritation. I reme mber 
my f -- I reme mber my father 
just looking at her and saying, 
that™s end of conversation. You know, in this fa
mily we don™t -- we don™t talk like that, you 
know. Really -- I mean, you know, it™s the first time  I 
actually heard my father talk to my mother 
-- if they talked like that togeth
er, it wasn™t in my presence, that™s the first time I heard my -- I 
heard my fat her being quite curt about this 
thing. And sure enough, of course, what happened, 
much to my mother™s horror, I suspect, I did my si -- infantry training, and before I knew what 
was happening, they™d sent me  on three weeks emba
rkation leave, and -- 
to -- to join another 
adjacent battalion -- infantry battalion in a
nother county next door. You know, it™s like  
[indecipherable] Alexandria to -- to some th
ing, you know, else. Wa  -- you™re on your way to 
Korea, this bat -- battalion had been chosen to
 -- to go to Korea. You know, all people below 18 
step back. I reme mber we -- I came back from w
eekend leave and we had a morning parade, step 
back, you -- you are not going, all those 18 and a
bove, pick up your three week embar kation 
leaves, and sign your -- sign your -- 
to the effect that if you are late from - -  from -- from three 
weeks leave, you are no longer classifi ed as ab
sent [indecipherable] if you™re late, you™re 

classified as a deserter, because you™re going ove
rseas as a ba ttalion, and b- by the way, before 
you leave today, sign your -- all of you sign your 
wills. [indecipherable] you know. So here am I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
59 
 
 
at the age of 18, signing a will, 
which I didn™t have anything sign 
on, but I think it™s done for 
pension, or if some thi
ng should happen you know. 
Q: Sure, sure. 
A: And I come home, and I tell my parents 
[indecipherable] you know, and I™m on three weeks 
embarkation leave, you know. We ll, there was not
hing they could do about that. On the morning 
which we left, I got up early. My father wa -- bef 
-- we had breakfast together, and then he went 
to work, but we shook hands. And his only comment 
to me  -- he didn™t hug 
-- we didn™t hug each 
other, it wasn™t -- that wa
sn™t -- it wasn™t his -- 
Q: Style, yeah. 

A: Style. We shook hands, and he just sai
d, ﬁDon™t do anything to dishonor our name .ﬂ  
Q: Oh. We  c a n stop for a second.  

A: And we shook hands, and I say, my father 
said, you know, don™t do anything to ho -- dishonor 
our name , and off he we nt to work. My mother came to the -- decided she™d come  to the railway 
station with me , f -- on the way back to camp, 
and she gave me  a s mall plaque, with the 10 
commandments. And now she was very qui -- I thi
nk she -- she got more religious as time  went 
by, and -- and I think she just said, ﬁT
his is going to take care of you.ﬂ  
Q: Huh. 
A: Now, I don™t quite know wha -- why. And she sa
id, ﬁYou take it.ﬂ So I put it in my wallet, 
and obviously it did take care of me . 

Q: Yeah. Which leads me to ask, in all those year
s, or even -- even before they left Germany, 
were -- your parents did not live in a Jewi
sh community, but were they religious?  
A: I think -- let me put it this 
way, I don™t know how re
ligious my father r
eally was in Germany. 
Th -- in Halle there was a germ -- a Jewish 
community, with a jewi
 -- with a synagogue. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
60 
 
 
Q: Did they attend? 
A: I f -- I -- I think they did. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I -- I think they did. But how
 -- how, you know, religious they 
-- they were, I honestly can™t 
tell you. 

Q: But it wasn™t some thing that
 was discussed regularly -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- so if they were, it was -- they kept
 it to themselves, or between themselves. 
A: No, I won™t say that, it™s just
 that my father was 
not what you would call a religious person to 
discuss religion.  

Q: I see. 

A: You know. I -- I don™t know, at
 -- it yo -- it™s an interes
ting question. He and I never 
discussed religion. 
Q: Mm-hm. So then there™s no way to know, in
 a sense, what kind of impa ct this whole 
experience had on his belief.  
A: I initially thought, for a long time , that his 
belief -- that he™d gone the other way. That, in 
other words, he just didn™t 
believe in anything any more.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And sometimes I had the feeling that he did 
things because my mother was a little bit more 
keen and enthusiastic, and that in order to stop gr
umbles, he -- he went along with things. He did 
not attend a lot of -- in
 the early stages -- you know, it was 
a small -- there were about half a 
dozen, my me mory of t here were about half a 
dozen English Jewish pe
ople living in Bedford, 
where we g -- where I grew up. Most of them
, I t hink, had been born in London. They were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
61 
 
 
English -- born in England. My mot her -- we woul d go to the services, they were usually held in 
some body™s house, at the -- at -- 
two or three time s in the year, okay. And I did have a Bar 
Mitzvah, but it was in some body™s house, cause
 there™s no synagogue, there was no Jewish 
community, and there isn™ t to this day. 

Q: Was there a rabbi? 

A: They would try and get hold of a rabbi, I 
believe, from London. If not, then whoever was 
most conversant and fluent, mi ght take the 
service, if you follow what I™m getting -- 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: During the war, ther e were -- my mother a
nd I would go to these things. My father was 
working, and he couldn™t afford to take off the time .  

Q: Right. 

A: It was too important, it was just, you know. 

Q: Right.  
A: You know. So it wasn™t a very big -- it was no
t a big thing. And the other -- in fact, the -- 
there were several othe
r -- I think I mentioned this to you, 
there were several other Jewish 
refugees. I recall perhaps one or two who were quite
 elderly, and there were some  -- three or four 
ladies, women, who were ma rried, but whose husba
nds weren™t -- and who husbands never got -- 
came out, and -- and were killed, 
unfortunately, in the death camp
s. And as a result, they, to 
some  degree, adopted me, if you -- if you follow what I™m getting at. You know, they would -- I 
want to say that they were all -- I became  -- th
ey were all mot hers, but they looked upon me  -- 
they would always ask, where is -- where 
is John, or where is Johnny, you know. You know, 
these ladies -- these women lived in -- by themselves
 in rooms. Some  had to work -- they all had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
62 
 
 
to work, but they try -- you know
, they -- I -- I think 
they all came from reasonably well-to-do 
circumstances. Nobody really asked anybody to -- 
End of Tape Two Side B

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John 
Meyerstein. This is tape three, side A. These wome n?  
A: Yeah, these wome n, and yo -- as I say, you 
can count the numbers who I can reme mber, 
barely on the fingers of, you know, two hands. A
nd perhaps the ones I™m thinking about, not 
even that ma ny. And they rema ined in Bedfor
d long after the war was over, and they would 
always ask my mother, you know -- an-and I can re
me mber someti mes meeting for a cup of tea 
in downtown Bedford, you know, in a restaurant 
or a café or some thing, even during the war 
years, th-th -- two or 
three would get together
, and I™d come  along, and so how™s John, or how™s 
Johnny, and -- and so forth. And -- so they, in thei
r own way, I suspect, were almost adopting me  
without saying so. And I don™t mean that in any,you know, affect -- loving way, but just -- it was 

-- to them, that meant something. And another th
ing which I thought was rather interesting was 

that the mo ment I was called into the military se
rvice, my parent™s stock went up in the world. 
People sa -- if -- you have to reme mb er, I grew up 
in -- in the ca -- in a pl
ace -- in England, in a -
- in a -- in a community, pa
rticular ly after World War 
11
 -- now we™re talking for -- World War 
11
 
finished in ™46 -- ™45, I™m talk
ing now ™53, I-I™m on a -- I-I™m in the army on a way to -- to 
Korea. That™s only eight years. On the street 
in which I grew up, or everywhere, there wasn™t 
some body who didn™t have a brother, an uncle, a 
father, a grandfather, a nephew, a niece, 
somebody who hadn™t served in the -- in the -- in 
the British military, of which most would have 
had to be sent overseas. Very similar now to wh
at I -- what we read 
and hear and see happening 
to Americans. So now my pare
nts, people who -- English people
 would say, what™s happening to 
John?  So my parents were not long 
-- refugees in that context. 
Q: Uh-huh, they were full British citizens. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
64 
 
 
A: We ll, they were now viewed as being in the si
milar vein, and I think my
 parents -- I th -- not 
that we discussed it, but I™m 
looking back now, people would say, oh I met so and so, he wanted 
to know how you were doing. My mother in partic
ular, my father didn™t -- wasn™t that way 
inclined, but my mother, among, 
you know, other English people, neighbors and so forth. And I 
think that that had some thing to 
do with these other now elderly la
dies, or quite older ladies, who 
again would sort of say, what™s happening. It -- 
it seemed to raise the level. They weren™t 
refugees from Ger man oppressi
on. So me body was doing equal things. 
Q: Right, right. It™s interesting how -- 
A: If that mean -- if -- if you understand.I don™t know whether it has any me aning.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: I think it had meaning. 

Q: To them, sure. 

A: To them, yeah. 
Q: Sure, sure. 
A: It gave my parents status. 
They could talk on equal terms. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And in some  instances, of course, on more 
terms, because some  of my peer group ended up 
not going overseas. So here was I now doing 
some thing which was far more serious -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- than, you know, being posted to Scotland or  some place like that. 

Q: Right, right, right, right. And how long did you serve? 

A: I came out in ™55. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
65 
 
 
A: I came out in ™55, yeah, we -- I came  back on a troop ship, you know came back, and was 
then -- and then ended up in a -- what is like
 -- you would have to 
call now like the National 
Guard. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Not from a voluntary point of 
view, but the system was, when 
you did your two ye
ar™s stint in 
-- in dr aft --  National Service it was called, Englis
h -- but it™s the same  thing as the draft, yeah. 
You then went into -- they call it terr itorial 
army, which was like the National Guard, and I 
would -- I had to do five weekends, and one fort
 -- two we -- a two or 
three week camp every 
year. 

Q: Mm-h m 

A: We ll, this was in ™55, and I was living at
 home with my parents, looking for a job. The 
situation was a little bi
t different. What I™d seen and witn
essed, and been involved in was now 
totally different from my peer
 group at school, who™d ri -- 
who™d gone on -- who™d never gone 
overseas. We  were all the same  age level, but
 me ntally I was far removed, if you understand 
what I™m getting. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: It took me a little bit -- it took me several mo
nths to wind down from t h
is -- this scenario, if 
you understand what I™m getting about. So I do unders
tand of -- I -- I -- I 
-- I have a lot of 
understanding as to what™s taking place right now, from an I r aq point  of view -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- with the United Stat es forces, particular ly at that same age level. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
66 
 
 
A: Cause I came  back -- now, was a very funny s
ituation, I came back -- I came out, and I wasn™t 
even 21. Now, in England at that time, you coul
dn™t vote if you™re 21. You had to get permission 
to get ma rried if you were -- if you were less th
an 21. You couldn™t buy ciga
rettes if you were -- 
unless you were 21, and you couldn™t go into a bar, or
 a pub, as they call it in England, and order 
a drink if you were under 21. So, when I came out, 
when I was released, I was released -- my 
parents came to the railway station to pick me  
up. We  -- we came off the boat, took the train to 
Bedford, and my parents came to me, and they™d
 already called the -- 
the -- the -- the -- the 
regime ntal depot to say, you know, when are they  comi ng in, and they™d said, oh, you know, he™s 

-- he should be arriving at th
e railway station, and so on. They
 said, can we go and see him?  
They said yeah, but have to reme mber, he -- they
™re going to come  into the -- we™re gonna -- he™s 
going to have to come  to the -- he can say hell
o to you, but he™s got to come  to the depot, but 
they™ll be -- he™ll be going on l
eave later on this evening, okay. Bu
t we -- we need to do some  
for ms, and it™ll be for three weeks, and then he
 goes back for a couple of days, and then it™s 
release, you see. So my parents had told me  th
is was happening. So, I was not 21 yet, but I was 
on three weeks paid leave, but still in the military. So I arrived at home in uniform, and you 

know, for three weeks I was running around in civili
an clothes. And one evening I went to a pub 
nearby to get a drink, and I -- you kn
ow, I had to get a packet of 
cigarettes. And I walked in -- 
and -- well, but I™ve told this st
ory [indecipherable] parents and to
 my wife and to my  kids, and 
it™s hilarious. I walked in, and I went to the bar 
and I said, ﬁI™d like a half
 a glass of beer, and -- 
and a packet of Craven A cigarettes.ﬂ And the 
barman looked at me  and said, ﬁHow old are you 
sonny?ﬂ You know, and -- and the -- and the older peoplesitting at the bar, I could hear the little 

titters of laughter, you see. He
 says, ﬁYou come  back when you™re 21.ﬂ You know. So I walked 
out of the bar in a real high state. You have to
 reme mber, I™d come  back from Korea, you see. I

walked home, I went upstairs -- this in my parent
s house, and I got out of 
my civilian clothes, 
and -- 
Q: Put your uniform on. 

A: -- put my uniform [indecipherable]. And they sa
id, ﬁWhat™s the matter?ﬂ I said, ﬁI went to get 
a packet of cigarettes and they turned me  dow
n.ﬂ I put on my uniforms, which had my ribbons on 
it, everything else. And I -- I-I think I run b
ack to the pub, you know, got [indecipherable] stood 

outside, and sort of got myself 
organized, and I walked in. Ther
e was the same  bar ma n and the 
same  group of people, it wasn™t very far away. And 
I said, ﬁI want a glass 
of beer, and a packet 
of Craven A cigarettes.ﬂ And the barman had a straight  face, and he pulled this beer out for me , 

and he said, ﬁ Which cigarettes 
did you order?ﬂ And I said, ﬁA packet of 20 Craven A.ﬂ And 

there wasn™t a sound from 
the -- from the other -- 
Q: That™s a great story. 

A: -- you -- you know, from the other -- you know, who we
r e  still sitting on the bar, so they were 
looking at me, but not more titters, you see. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And I thought this was 
-- I was so annoyed, you see. 
Q: That™s a great story. 

A: And that was the end of -- I mean, of c
ourse, nobody said anything, and I know -- I drank my 
beer, smoked my cigarettes, which you know, 
obviously didn™t do me  any good, I don™t smoke 

[indecipherable] 

Q: Right. 

A: Just to prove a point. That had not
hing to do with religion, of course -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
68 
 
 
A: -- I was just so ticked off, you know, I was re
ady to take the par -- th-the pub apart, you see. 
Q: I bet. 
A: Not that that would have 
happened, but nobody said a word -- 
Q: Yeah, yeah, that™s great. 

A: -- they just all looked at me , and -- and th
en tol -- turned and drank their beer again. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: And I™m sure that same  situation is going on -- 

Q: Everywhere. 

A: -- right now, here.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: In ™56 -- and I™m still -- I turned 21. In ™56, 
Britain, with Fr ance went 
into the Suez, and if you 
reme mber, Israel attacked from the other side, 
because Egypt had taken ov
er the Suez canal. In 
™56, I was -- I forget which day it was now, I wa
s in London on a in -- going -- going for a job 
interview, or so. And I came  b
ack -- I™d taken the train up in the morning, and I™d come back in 
the -- be fore suppertime -- it™s only an hour each 
way by train. And my mother said to me, ﬁI 
think you better stay home  this evening.ﬂ And 
I -- you know, not with a happy look on her face. 
And I said, ﬁOh, why? ﬂ And she said, ﬁ Well, th
e police came  round this afternoon. They want to 
give you some thing.ﬂ And I -- so I said, ﬁWell,
 why didn™t you take it? ﬂ They said, ﬁNo, no, 
you™ve got to sign for this.ﬂ So they -- I said, ﬁW
ell, what did you say? ﬂ They said, ﬁWell, I told 
them you™d be back -- you were in London for the day, you™d be back.ﬂ They said, ﬁWell, we™ll 

be along tonight at nine o™clock.
ﬂ So I said, ﬁAll right.ﬂ They 
said -- my mother said, ﬁYou™d 
better stay at home  for this.ﬂ I said [indeciphe
rable] not go out or [indecipherable] that™s okay. 
Sure enough about nine-ish in th
e evening, police car turn up at 
my -- at our door, and -- and a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
69 
 
 
knock on the door, and you know, ﬁJohn Meyerstein?ﬂ 
I said, ﬁYeah.ﬂ They said, ﬁWe got a 
document.ﬂ And it was in one of these buff colored envelopes, and in those days it was on Her 
Majesty™s Se rvice, you see?  You™ve 
got to sign for this thing. And 
inside was a call-up notice to -
- to -- to me , to say that if I move from th
e house for more than 72 hours, I was t -- it wa s -- in 
those days they didn™t call it Departme nt of Nati
onal Defense, it was War Offi ce, to say that the 
document was headline -- headed th -- you know -- 
letterhead was Wa r Offi
ce, to say that if I 
move from t his -- my place of residence for mo
re than 72 hours, I was to notify the Wa r Office, 
and I was to hold myself in r
eadiness for an imme diate call-up
, you see?  So I -- I d -- well, I 
don™t quite know why, I™m not a re
servist, th -- you know, I -- th
e reservists were people who 
didn™t do anything, but they got paid
. I was not a reservist in that
 way, I was in the territorial, 
which was like the National Guard. So the next 
morning, I called the -- the -- the depot where I 
u-used to do th -- for the traini
ng. It was the same ba -- regime nt
al battalion which I™d started off 
with, you see. And I said, you know, I just had th
is call-up [indecipherable]. ﬁ Well,ﬂ they said, 
ﬁyeah you -- there™s nothing you can do about it.ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁ Well, what do you mean? ﬂ  They 
said, ﬁWell, you served in Korea, so on your f
ile -- we don™t have to 
train you again, you™ve had 
training for all these things.ﬂ And 
of course, in between that 12 
months, I had -- I™d done s-some  
-- locally, some parachute training, because it ga
ve you extra money, and the wings looked pretty 
good on your battle dress, you see. And they said, 
ﬁ Well, you™ve got all these things, they don™t 
have to train you. There™s nothing you can do, you know
, it™s -- it™s -- it™s been -- it™s flagged, 
you know, that you™ve served in a -- in a combat z
one before. It™s different
 if we have to get 
some body a nd we™re going to train them. We don™t 
need to give you 16 week
s training,ﬂ or stuff 
like that, in much the same way as
 it™s -- it™s -- to some  degree 
it™s happening here, as I read in 
the papers right now. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  
A: So, of course, I showed this to my parents,
 and of course nothing wa
s said, there™s nothing I 
could do about it. Now, it ma y have been that my
 mother wasn™t so -- don™t forget, Israel was 
now on the other side. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So -- so there was a different s -- a very -- 
it wasn™t the Israeli army
 calling me  up, it was the 
British army calling me up. And then I got a job 
interview. I got a job application, you know. 
And I took it, and that™s -- and the company wanted
 me  to s -- go overseas 
to -- to -- to Singapore 
on their behalf. And I called the 
depot -- depot, and said, you know 
-- I didn™t hear anything for -
- for awhile. And I -- I called the depot and said, 
ﬁI™ve got this job.ﬂ They said, ﬁWell you take 
the job, you™ve -- I mean, you™ve just been -- you™v
e just been put on notic
e. If -- you know, if 
they™re going to do something, they™re going to 
get in -- they™ll getyou wherever you are,ﬂ you 
see. I mean, that is how it™s d -- I don™t know it™s
 done in -- in the st -- in
 the United States, but in 
Britain they would know
 wherever you are. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Okay. So I went to -- I went to Singapore to 
work, didn™t hear any more
 about it. About a year 
after -- all this is ove
r in ™56, I get a notice from the depot, 
ﬁPlease report for -- for -- for the two 
or three weeks annual -- annual ma neuvers,ﬂ or 
whatever it is, you see. So I wrote immediately 
back and said, ﬁI™m in Singapore, you want -- 
you know, you™ve sent me  the thing here, could 
you send me  a travel warrant,ﬂ which it was the st
andard thing to do f -- t -- from Singapore to 
London and London back to Singapore, or how do you 
wish me to proceed?  I got -- never got an 

answer back. I never got -- I 
never had another letter.  
Q: Never -- never noticed.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
71 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Huh. Huh. Who knows 
what that was about. 

A: We ll, I think some body laughed -- looked at
 it, I mean they would all know this -- 

Q: [indecipherable]. Right. 

A: -- and the people, because in a small comm
unity like that, everybody 
know it -- my mother 
knew the wife of -- of one of -- of the people w
ho worked in the -- in the depot, or some thing, 
and they would have known this is going out. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And -- and so they probably sa
id, oh, this is nonsense and -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- what do we call John back for, we™re 
gonna spend mone y on an air ticket for him. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: You know, the -- the -- the battalion™s not goi
ng to fall or -- or br
eak because he™s -- 
Q: On this guy. 

A: -- he™s not here. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So those are --  those are some rather interesting military experiences. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And wha t  is interesting is th
at that battalion, grandfathered in
to different name s, was the first 
battalion sent by the British army to Kabul to pa
rticipate with the united 
-- or to Afghanistan 
with the -- 

Q: Afghanistan. 

A: -- with the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
72 
 
 
Q: Intere sting. 
A: -- with the -- with 
the American forces -- 
Q: Intere sting. 

A: -- actually. Interesting to this day, yeah. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: And I know this because the --
 the ba -- the regime nt, the ba
ttalion, the -- the 
[indecipherable] 
regime nt still sends me , every three or four mont
hs, a little brochure of up-to-date happenings as 
to what is -- is going on, you know, and what th
ey™re doing, because of what Britain is doing 
now in Iraq, as well as in -- in
 -- in -- in -- in 
-- still in Afghanist
an [indecipherable] 
Q: Right, right, right. I™m going to
 try and ma ke a jump here now, in terms of our narrative, back 
to ma king some  connections with the St. Louis e
xperience, if I can. You -- and I don™t mean to 

dimi nish the in-between years, but
 we™re really lo
oking to talk -- 
A: I understand. 
Q: -- to relate to -- to this 
subject. You end up in Asia -- 
A: Working. 

Q: -- working in Asia, married? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And your parents are s
till living in England? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. And -- and they live 
to quite -- both of them, quite a -- quite an old age? 
A: My father lived to --  died in
 -- at  -- in I th -- my father -- 
my father™s birthday was March the 
10
th
, he died at the end of 1986, which would have ma
de hi m,  I think at that
 -- at that period if 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
73 
 
 
I™m not -- yeah, I think I™m right, 
si -- about six weeks -- almo -- 
or six or seven weeks short of 
93. And he™s buried in England. 
Q: And -- and your mother? 

A: She died in Decembe r 2001, and shelived to 91 and a half, exactly.  

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m. An d -- a
nd where is she buried?   
A: She™s buried next -- they -- when they -- they 
bought graves in a d -- in a -- years be -- before, 
in a Jewish cemetery, outside Bedford, betw
een London and Bedford. They bought two graves 
and they™re lying side by side w
ith -- each with their own headstone. 
Q: Mm-hm. And did she 
die in England also? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, so sh -- 

A: And -- and -- and -- in -- in -- in -- in p
eace and -- and -- and n-no -- no pressure, you know, 
no ha -- peace and quiet, let™s put it that way. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And -- and -- in their last ye
ars of their lives were you -- did you see them a lot, or -- were 

they reflective a-about their experience, or ha
d they kind of moved ahead and looking straight 
ahead -- 

A: My father never discussed it.
 Again, I have to tell you that. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: A-And my father™d become  -- we didn™t talk a
bout that period at all, but he™d become  a little 
bit more mellow. My mo ther, I think, emotiona
lly, was still a little 
bit more, you know -- could 
really not forget th
ese things, you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
74 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Despite the fact that, you know, from a physical
 point  of view, because one can say me ntal 
stress could be equally as ba
d as physical stress, you know.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: She, I think, coped with it harder. She di
d not bury it to the same
 degree, but, you know, and 
I™m not sure how one -- how one copes on this 
thing, you know. Individual people have different 
situations on this. They -- my mother went to 
Israel twice to see her 
mother. My father went 
once, and they both came to North America to s -- to visit me . 

Q: Because you ended up in Canada. 

A: Because I ended up in Canada, and of c
ourse we had two grandchildren of that 
[indecipherable]. And my mother ev
en then flew, while she was in Canada from Toronto to New 
York to spend a week with Margot -- Aunt Ma
rgot, quote, unquote, as I me ntioned to you before, 
earlier in the discussions. 
Q: Her friend from school. 
A: Yeah, and spent -- and stayed with
 her and then came back again, you know. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I did ask my parents -- my mother was quite k
een to come  and join us. My father -- we went 
for a walk, and you have to reme mbe r , my father 
was already now in his 80™s, or just -- yeah, 
beginning his 80™s. And I asked him, and he said, ﬁN
o,ﬂ he said, ﬁI -- I™m 
too old.ﬂ He says -- he 
looked upon North America, he liked everythi
ng which he saw, but he thought it was a younger 
person™s country. And for him I think it would ha
ve been re-rooting another tree, took him long 
enough to plant in England, if you 
want to put it that way. I thi
nk that would have been too 
much. My mother, I think, was interested in th
at time. I think my father found his English 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
75 
 
 
solitude  comforting. He -- he was ve ry much an is
land unto himself. You 
can™t really live that 
way, but he tried his utmost to -- 
to -- t-to -- to activate that so
rt of situation, I think. But they 
didn™t come again -- he didn™t come
 a gain, and -- and -- and that™s 
quite an effort. In those days 
they really wanted, you know, they
 didn™t like if -- people who were
 quite old to fly. I mean, he 
was physically fit okay, but I mean, he was in 
his 80™s. I mean, can you imagine wha t  would 
have happened if he™d had a heart attack or some thing, you know? 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And -- an -- as you were then left home , and had your own life, and 

children of your own, how did you integrate your ear
lier experiences with 
your later life, and -- 
and were you able to move ahead, and did it 
motivate you in any way, either socially, or 

politically, or  rel -- in a --  in 
a -- in terms of a religious comm
unity, can you -- are you able to -- 
to sort of understand how those earlyyears formed you and affected you later? 

A: I think -- that™s not an
 easy question to answer. 
Q: I know, it™s a hard -- it™s 
very hard as a -- it™s a -- 
A: I certainly think that the -- th
e early years ma de me  much more self sufficient, or reliant upon 
myself. My parents didn™t, for a long time, di
dn™t know a lot of people 
-- and I™m talking about 
people in England, English people to whom they 
could ask questions and 
-- as to what one 
should be doing, how should we do it. So everyt
hing which I thought about, or wanted to do, I 
would have to sort of glean for myself thr
ough my questions, wondi -- wondering whether that 
person would know wha t  I was talking about or so 
forth. So, i-it ma de me stand on my own feet, 

equally so. My military experiences certainly he
lped in that, because in those days when you 
went for a job interview, more or less any comp
any would ask, have you been
 in the mi litary?  In 

England, what sort of school did you go to, and have you served in the mi litary and the third 

question was, have you served overs
eas?  And I think the reason for that
 was that they felt if -- if 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
76 
 
 
those three things all tied together, they had 
a reliable, disciplined pe
rson, who would understand 
what to do, okay. Now whether that™s true today, I 
suspect not to the same  degree at all. M-My 
father being so much older, was -- wasn™t -- wasn™t 
that easy to relate in terms, I mean, when I -- 
I watch -- I go out to watch our grandkids play 
soccer or  some thing like that, and we -- and we™re 
not close together, we -- they live very far apar
t, but when we do -- or we™ve done for our own 
kids when they were doing that. Girls play soc
cer these days now. I don™t mean that in a silly 

way, but -- 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: -- but my father didn™t have the time  or the energy. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, af -- and probably was still too de
pressed. And my mother was also working in 
whatever shape or form to bring some  extra 
money in. Not the nicest of jobs, you know, cleaning 
floors, and washing clothes in -- in a -- in so
me body™s house is not exactly what she was used to, 
but it paid the -- it paid bills, and eventually sh
e di dn™t have to do that. So, I didn™t really have 
that -- that cl ose-knit relationshi
p. I was very grateful to my father for ma king sure, and going 
out of his way, with all his efforts to get me  
a good education, and -- and a certain standard of -- 
of -- of decency, and -- and -- and how to live,
 and how to behave. And the -- and that -- you 
know, the behavior -- to him, be
havior and dignity were terribl
y important, which I think you can 
understand. My mother was a much more emo
tional person, I think be
came some what more 
religious in later years. But we didn™t talk a great deal about it. It -- 
perhaps that was the way 

German Jews, who had lived in Germany for such
 -- and I don™t mean that in any demeaning 
way, had integrated so much that they did not view
 themselves so much as Jewish as they viewed 
themselves as Germans of a Jewish
 religion, i-if you understand, actually. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
77 
 
 
Q: Quite a different thing, sure. 
A: Okay?  

Q: Absolutely. 

A: And we didn™t talk about
 that. Nobody ma de any dema nds upon anybody. And it™s very hard 
for me  to understand that. When I went to get a j
ob interview, when I was 
being inter -- in -- and 
I™m only speaking about my experiences 
in England, nobody ever asked, you know, what 
religion are you, i-if you unde
rstand what I™m getting at. 
Q: Yes, mm-hm.  

A: I mean, just to give you an illustration 
of how these -- I™m only speaking now from the 
English point of view. Years later I™m living in
 Canada, I™m running a business of my own, and 
dealing with British companies of quite si zable 
renown and -- renow -- reno
wn in -- in their own 
fields. And suddenly I™m asked -- I get a call from
 -- from -- from a senior army officer from 
England saying we™re going to be 
in eng -- in Canada in a short 
period of [indecipherable] we™d 
like you to consider being an 
honorary defense industries repres
entative for us. It™s purely 
honorary, it doesn™t pay anything. 
Would you be interest
ed?  And I thought to my -- well, I -- I 
said yes, you know, I mean, no re
ason. And I thought to my self -- he
 came  and in typical English 
way we me t, had a meal, some  drinks. He knew 
exactly what school I™d been to, where I™d done 
my service, who I was representing. I have to as
sume  that some  of the companies from England, 
who deal with Departme nt of National Defense said
 we have so and so. And they want -- and he 
said it™s purely honorary, but it opened the doors to
 a lot of scenarios. And I said to my wife 
after, isn™t it funny a German Je
wish refugee, sitting in Canada 
now, has been asked to be an 
honorary situation in this way, where I™d come , you see.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
78 
 
 
A: And I -- I mean, this is ma ny years -- a number of years ago. And I thought, what an 
achieveme nt for myself, you know, i-
if I can view it in that way. 
Q: Sure. 

A: I just thought it was 
a great -- it wa s an honor.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I don™t know how much 
it really benefited me, but it was 
-- I thought it was an honor to me , 
as to how far I™d come , and the 
-- and the -- the -- the feeling of 
-- of -- of being able to have 
some body a sk that, and not sort of say, where are 
your antecedents, and --
 and -- and -- and so 
forth.  

Q: Right. 

A: And so these things had -- but nobody said to
 me , are you Jewish?  Wh
at religion 
are you?  Are 
you a refugee?  We re you the son of a refugee?  No
w, why would they ask in the first pl ace, but 
my parents didn™t talk about the St
. Louis to other people. They talked perhaps, to other Jewish, 
in that little group -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- about it. And if some body who had an unde rstanding, like yoursel
f, they mi ght -- my 
mother -- certainly my father w
ouldn™t have discussed it with you. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know. And -- but beyond that, that was an er
a which had gone, from my father™s point of 
view. I don™t think he would have
 appreciated it. I don™
t know how best to 
answer your -- your 
question that way. I-I don™t know. I -- I went to -- 
I went to visit Israel in 1967 -- ™67, yes. And I 
talked to my  mother™s brother. I 
stayed with my uncle and his wife. 
Q: Lothar? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
79 
 
 
A: Lota, yeah. His wife was Laur
a. She ran a flower business and 
had the contract to supply the 
Israeli parliame nt every day with flowers. And 
she -- and I had the chance -- she took me with 
her, and I had a chance to see the 
-- the Israeli parliament and to 
explain various other things and 
so forth. My uncle was also very much an inte
llectual, eve -- you know, in his own way. Also a 
lawyer, but never practiced law.
 Too late for him, you know. 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  
A: And never practiced it in Isr
ael either. And worked at the -- 
the la --  the library in --  in 
Jerusalem or some thing like that, you know, he li
ked -- he was great on books. And he told me  
quite frankly, he said, ﬁI™m -- I™m an agnostic.I™ve -- I™ve become  an agnostic.ﬂ And I said, 

ﬁ Well then, do you go to the synagogue?ﬂ He and I 
were just talking alone quietly. And I said, 
ﬁ Were you always an agnostic?ﬂ And I think he sa
id to me  no, not initially, but he said, ﬁIt 
wasn™t a very deeply religious household in whic
h we grew up in,ﬂ for whatever reasons, we 
didn™t go into that detail, and I don™t know, you 
know, because what is one ma n™s viewpoint -- 
personal viewpoint, not -- mi ght
 not necessarily reflect 
what actually did happen 
[indecipherable]. And I said, ﬁSo, do you go on th
e Jewish high holidays to the -- to the 
synagogue?ﬂ And he said, ﬁ Well,ﬂ he said, ﬁI do, but
,ﬂ he said, ﬁbut that™s really to please your 
aunt.ﬂ But he said it doesn™t do any harm to s

sitting down there. But 
he said, ﬁAre you asking me  would I go voluntaril
y?  No.ﬂ But he said, ﬁWhat difference does it 
ma ke? ﬂ  He said, ﬁI go. So, after all, I™m free to 
do what I want.ﬂ So I don™t know how best to 
answer that  situation ther e. 

Q: And wha t  about yourself, do you go?

Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John 
Meyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on July fi
rst, 2004, in Washington, D.C. This is tape 
number three, side B. 
A: I -- I -- I -- I™m not -- I can™t 
say that I™m an agnostic, or an atheist, because I wouldn™t have 
made the same comment to my uncle. And by the 
way, my uncle always wrote to me  in English, 
you know, from Israel. I would send him books, a
nd he would send me  a recommendation on 
books. Course, his recommendation on books were 
based on his time at the university, you 
know, when he was studying in Germany, okay. Whereas my books would be on more current 
affairs, you know, current affairs, politics, North 
America, British, or  something like that, he -- 
he loved that. And I would send him the books, and he
 would read that. In fact my -- my -- my -- 
my cousin, his son, he had two children, a -- a bo
y and a girl -- his son, when his father died, 
when my uncle died, called me  up to tell me  
what  had happened, and I -- you know, and I -- and 
we were talking and he said, ﬁYou know, I™ve suddenly discovered all my  father™s papers. He 
ma de a photostatic co [indecipherable] a duplicate 
copy of every letter he wrote to you, and he 
kept every one of your letters.ﬂ And he said, ﬁI
™m looking at a pile of books, now.ﬂ We were on 

the phone, and he said, ﬁI™m looking at a pile 
of books. I had no idea that you™d sent him these 
things.ﬂ There™s a bit of an age gap between us
, you know, he™s about 50, 
and -- and I™m -- I™ll be 
70 next year. And he said, ﬁI had no idea that he
 kept all the,ﬂ -- we 
didn™t know this, you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
81 
 
 
He said, ﬁI™m going to have to 
go through all this,ﬂ and 
-- and -- and this is very important, it was 
more important for him to tell me this than 
it was for me  to mention it to him, you see. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: But, going back to you -- to the -- is it a quick
 -- that was a quick assign
me nt, ta -- to say to 
you is my -- my children keep in touch with them
, you know, and last year my wife, just a -- and 
this is rather interesting thing, last 
year my -- my wife had a -- a f -- a 50
th
 cli -- university cl ass 
reunion in Bath, England. And it was time for me
 to do the headstone for my mother, cause you 
generally don™t -- it™s in the -- in the grave, you 
don™t put a headstone in 
in the first few months 
or a year because the ground tends to move, a
nd the stones can fall over. So I™d had the 
headstone ma de, ma de arrangeme nts for the people 
in England to carve the headstone to ma tch 
the duplicate of my father, an-and 
to have it in there so for my 
arrival, so I could combine the 
trip. My wife  was very keen, cause this is a on
e off thing, and if she di
dn™t attend there™d be no 
second 50
th
, you know, reunion in Bath, England, cause she 
we nt t-to study home  economi cs in -
- you know, in Bath, a-as a -- as a student, oka
y. And -- and she™d been
 to Wa shington long 
before I ever got here. She -- after she™d finish
ed u-university studies, she came  to visit, her 
father sent her through the United St
ates to have a -- to -- to -- to
 see North America in general, 
actually, long before I ever got here. While she 
was at school studying, I was in Korea, you see. I 
always say to her, my taxes, she got a -- got a 
free education. But anyway, and we did all this, 
you see, we -- we went to -- and of course she ca 
-- we went together to bury my mother and -- 
and so forth. My children are awar
e of this. Last year when we we
re back, my cousin, the older g 
-- my uncle, a girl. She now has four children of
 her own, and more grandchildren than I™ve got, 
you know. In the last month she™
s just had two, suddenly. But sh
e turned up with her husband, 
with her daughter. She wa s comi ng on a business tr
ip to Europe, but she wa s comi ng to England 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
82 
 
 
because she™d found out that I was comi ng -- we 
hadn™t seen each other fo
r years -- but -- with 
her husband. Her daughter was living -- was spe
nding some  time in England. Her son, who was 
ma rried, was spending some  time in England as 
well. We all met in London for a meal, for 
lunch. And we spent the whole -- we -- I think we
 met at 12, we didn™t br
eak up until six o™clock 
in the evening. And it™s very f
unny, her -- she is now e-mailing me almost on a regular basis, 
which hasn™t happened. Her son, who™s -- is e-ma
iling me , who I -- the youngest son, w-which 
we™d never me t before, I had no idea what he 
looked like and so forth. 
And it -- I don™t know 
why, whether it™s because I™m now t he oldest, 
we™re a much closer 
relationship, although we 
never discussed religion, you see. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So I don™t really know how fa
r -- how religious they are. We
 talk on the phone perhaps once 
every six months or so. I™ve -- I™ve pon -- we -- 
for -- for -- let me  put it this way, I don™t know, 
and I™m not sure whether this is -- whether I™m
 writing this. We hadn™t met -- and I have met my 
a -- f -- my -- my -- Daniella is her first name. 
We  hadn™t me t for 35 - 40 years. No, 35 years sa -- 
easily, in England, cause one of her children was actually born in England when I 

[indecipherable] not while I was there, but [inaudibl
e]. She is now, I think in her early 50™s or so. 
I don™t know whether I™m viewed now as being a 
rock. And I don™t mean that in any arrogant 
way. I™m -- I -- ma -- my -- my f -- agrees with me
 on this, we™ve talked about this, in fact my 
daughters also, I™ve discussed this with my da
ughters, who were -- you know
, my eldest daughter 
is 42, and the other one will be 38 this year, 
both married with children. I don™t know whether 
my cousins are -- view me  now as a sort of ro
ck, because of the worries which are going on in 
Israel. Do you follow, I™m the -- I™m the person 
living outside, not under these pressures, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
83 
 
 
there -- do you understand?  It™s almo
st like my -- am I the person they
 could turn to if some thing 
went wrong? 
Q: Oh, interesting. 

A: I -- I don™t know, I -- I don™t 
even know whether I™m -- I™m th
eorizing correctly or -- or 
incorrectly.  

Q: Right. 

A: But suddenly, there is an overwhelming desire 
on their part, it wasn™t on my part, initially, do 
you -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- you know, when -- when you™ve sort of grown apart. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I™m much closer, I™ve been always much
 closer with my cousin in Australia. 
Q: Mm-hm, interesting.  
A: And whe n, as you know, the -- the -- the German
 governme nt ha-have agreed, in more recent 
times, to -- to honor claims which the insura 
-- Ge rman insurance companies have, you know, 
confiscated from -- 
Q: Jews. 

A: -- from J e ws, and others, but Jews as -- in 
particular, and those ar
e now being checked out. 

And -- and as you know, the Swiss, you know -- 
you know, looted all the accounts. I, by sheer 
coincidence, not without any de
liberate scenarios, ha
ppened to hit a website about a year ago, 
and up popped my grandma -- parent™s names on my 
mother™s side, and my father™s name , my 
mother™s name  and my name , with
 all the right birthdates, pl aces
 of birth and the time of -- you 
know, th-the -- the date of birth, with the exac
t name s. Now, I  don™t know where they got these 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
84 
 
 
things from. So, I called my cousin in Australi
a, and it was agreed th 
-- that we would put a 
claim in for property -- we alrea
dy had that done before -- we  woul
d put in another claim, and we 
would also put in an insurance claim. And ri
ghtly or wrongly, I™ve no 
means of knowing. But my 
cousin in Australia said, ﬁJohn, will 
you take care of this? ﬂ  So I sa
id yes. Now, she physically is 
not so well any more. I mentioned the same -- I cal
led my t wo cousins in or -- in Israel, cause 
they™re the di rect grandchildren, like I am, of 
our grandfatheron my mo
ther™s side. And said, 
ﬁI™ve seen these name s, and I™v
e seen your father™s name  on th
eir as well, and my mother™s 
name . Not my na me , not your name s, but our 
-- I think you should -- did you notice?ﬂ ﬁNo, we 
didn™t notice.ﬂ They didn™t even know about this. 
I said, ﬁI think you should put some  -- a claim 
in.ﬂ And both of me  -- he said, ﬁJohn, you take 
care of it -- will you take
 care of it?ﬂ I said, 
ﬁ Well, I -- a-are you quite happy with this?ﬂ Be
cause in the applicati
on forms -- I™d already 
downloaded them from the computer, and I™d read
 them through. And of c ourse, don™t forget, it™s 
all in English, the applications have to be in 
English, and they™re not no
rmally speaking English 
at the -- so, it would -- that™s 
another reason they probably mi ght
 have thought let John do it, 
cause he understands the language 
better. And I said, ﬁAre you ab
solutely comfortable,ﬂ because 
I said that I will -- I si gn as 
the appl icant, and I ha ve to st
ate, which I would, and give your 
addresses of any other relatives 
who mi ght, should a claim ever be 
honored, if the -- if
 there is -- 
it ever come  up, that I undertak
e to insure that you were [i
ndecipherable] no question, no doubt 
in my -- please take care of it, I 
said, ﬁI tell you what, in that case
 I will do it, but I will give you 
copies of everything,ﬂ which I did, and to my 
cousin in Australia. But I said, ﬁRecognize 
some thing, our chances are less than
 one percent. If you look at it 
in that light, 
then you won™t 
get upset. If nothing happens, if it come s, whic
h we -- I doubt very much, then wh -- we™ll see 
what happens. But if you™re comfortable,ﬂ -- and 
they said, ﬁWe™re very comfortable.ﬂ And from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
85 
 
 
-- and, you know, and some how or another that s
uddenly -- and I™ve wondered to myself whether 
psychologically they look upon me  now as some
body who if some thing devastating we re to 
happen -- and I mean, unfortunately they are in an
 area of the -- of the world where, you know, I 
mean, things can happen elsewhere, but where 
things are not the most pleasant for everybody -- 
whether they don™t somehow look upon me  as be
ing somebody who mi ght be in a position to 
help, were some thing to go wrong. 

Q: Yeah. History has a funny way of
 ma king circles, doesn™t she? 

A: Mm. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, I wondered about that. Now, I don™
t know whether -- whether I™m exaggerating 
some thing, or whether -- 

Q: Well, if --  if they™r e not making that assumption -- 

A: I never have asked that -- 
Q: -- intellectually it™s easily, it™s -- 
A: -- it™s just a question -- I found it a b
it difficult to understand why they suddenly -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- after all these years -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- with complete families and 
grandchildren of their own -- ma
 -- my -- my -- th-the son, Uri, 
he has two daughters, they™re not ma rried yet. 

Q: Right. 

A: My cousin, the older one, the -- th
e -- a girl, is already a grandparent. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
86 
 
 
A: Whether there isn™t some
thing in what I™m saying. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: D-Do you follow what I™m getting at? 

Q: Yeah, yeah, think so. 

A: In other words, whatever -- and it seems to
 me that whatever deci
sions they™re now ma king, 
they call now to ask what my views were, wherea
s over the last 30 years, we barely exchanged 
cards. It™s almost as if they™re 
-- we™ve got to check to see -- 
Q: Got to have a plan, sort of. 

A: Or -- yeah, now I -- 
I hope that™s not -- 
Q: I hope for their sake that that™s not the case. 

A: -- that -- that I™m -- you know, I™d rather I was completely wrong in this. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And hopefully I am, that nothing is going to 
happen. Or whether it™s they™re worried about -- 
because they have parent s and grandparents who went through this. 

Q: Right. 

A: Now, I asked both my  -- I asked my cousin 
over lunch that time , you 
know, did -- did your -- 
did -- did y -- did your father, my uncle and your 
mother talk to you about all this?  They said 
ﬁNo, not really. In fact you™re telling us more. 
Things which we had no idea. And I™m,ﬂ she said, 

ﬁI™m going to tell Uri,ﬂ her brother, ﬁthat, 
you know, you™ve got more information than any,ﬂ 
they have more pictures for some  rea -- don™t as
k me  why, they have more pictures. I don™t -- 
perhaps my mother -- my grandmother put thos
e pictures in a rucksack. She couldn™t take 
anything else, perhaps she took some of those so
rt of things, you know. But I found that rather 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
87 
 
 
interesting. But again, to answer 
your questions, I -- we never talk
ed about these things. Perhaps 
we™re a bit more peculiar in
 that respect. I don™t know.  
Q: Let me  a sk you another question, comi ng back to 
the St. Louis -- and it™s a 
-- it™s -- I -- I ask it 
because I feel compelled to ask it, but given th
at we™ve just spent so much time talking about 
your whole life, and -- and understanding that yo
u -- that experience on the St. Louis, number 
one, is some thing you don™t reme mbe r  personally, a
nd was just one small part of a huge journey 
-- 
A: Four weeks, or thereabouts, yeah. 

Q: -- that your fa mily has taken. Nevertheless, I 
feel like I need to ask the question. There -- 
there -- when we look back at hist
orical events some times 50 years,
 60 years later, we™re -- they -
- they gain importance, or lose importance, 
depending on the perspectiv
e of the people who are 
looking. And here we are now, looking back to this
 event that happened in 1939, in an institution 
where an enormous a mount of huma n energy has 
been devoted to docume nting this period, this 
event and the period surrounding it. 
That aside, how do you look back
 on the St. Louis?  Is it a 
tiny blip to you, or do you have feel
ings about it, attitudes about it,
 in terms of in pol -- ma ybe 
political attitudes about it. And 
in terms of, you know, could ther
e have -- more been done?  And 
God knows that the f -- the entire course of 
your fa mily history would have been changed. 
A: Hm, no, I  -- that™s a fair question. 

Q: Or do you s -- or do you stop and think about it? 

A: No, I think, no, I think I can answer that. As far 
as the -- the me mories of the -- of the -- of the 
St. Louis, I would really just sa
y to you again, I was only four.  
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
88 
 
 
A: Okay. We™re talking 1939 
in May, I™d only turned four in March, so we  left in May, in June 
we arrived in England, okay. 
Q: Right. 

A: To me  that™s a very short period, and obvious
ly nothing untoward happened. I certainly don™t 
recall -- and I don™t hear my moth
er -- I don™t think my 
mother ever me ntioned anything of any 
problem with me, other than th
at one thing where I -- she --  
Q: Got lost. 

A: -- I got lost on the -- or some  -- or appeared 
to get lost in the [ind
ecipherable]. I do recognize 
though, I think, and I™ve often w
ondered why, you know, mor e  consideration could not have 
been given either by the U.S., and also Canada, 
Canada turned them down as well, no question 
about it. And Canada turned them down with mu
ch greater veheme nce, I think, indirectly, than 

let™s say other countries ma y have
 down. Just said no. I™ve read certain docume nts, or papers 
which -- in books, which indicate that there 
was a reason for it, Quebec being French, and 
Catholic, and you know, not keen to want anything to
 do with Jews at that time , had influence on 
the federal governme nt, I don™t know. Could some thi
ng have been done at this end?  Yes, I have 
to ask myself that question. Could, you know, could the federal governme nt, in it™s wisdom, 

ignore -- could the president of the United States 
or whatever, have ignore d the political antennas 
around him and said, for huma nita
rian reasons it™s a me re 1100 pe
ople, 1200 people or whatever. 
I think they could have done. I mean, when I 
see the way things are happening today. Would it 
have ma de a difference to my parents?  Hopefull
y it would have done. At least they would have 
had some  relatives like these people here -- 

Q: In Chicago. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
89 
 
 
A: -- in Chicago. How much they could have 
done to help beyond, I don™t know. It would have 
been a point of reference, I would imagine we w
ould have attempted to -- to go there, that™s the 
only point, just out of sheer gr
atitude, and they -- probably kn
owing them -- th
ey™re long dead 
now, and I honor them accordingl y, I™m sure they would have done everything possible to -- to 
help us, or to put us up, or it w
ouldn™t ma tter what it would have 
been. Ye s, I-I -- that™s always 
been a disappointment to me. Politics being pol
itics, I™m -- I™m logical enough to know that, you 
know, some body would argue that, you know, what 
are a thousand people in the context of a 
country™s overall requirements?  Wha t  did that 
German military storein
 Klausowitz say?  You 
know, war is just anot her name  for -- and a tactic
 of politics, or  some th
ing like that, I think you 
understand what I mean. I don™t know. I -- I -- I -- I 
certainly don™t think that
 Canada came out of 
it any -- in any great honor, notw
ithstanding what they mi ght do t
oday. Say certainly there were 
people who did go to the Prime Minister in Cana
da at the time, and say please do something, and 
I don™t mean just Jews. Could America have 
done some thing?  I don™t know. I don™t think the 
European countries who -- who gave sanction -- sa
nctuary to -- to the -- to us, whether it was 
England, or that -- did it with 
great enthusiasm, but they did it, you know. For which, certainly 
from England™s point of view, I™m
 eternally grateful, actually. A
nd I think I™ve repaid my s -- my 
score on that by -- by my  military service for U.
K. And I suppose in fairness -- and my parents 
are buried there, and all the benef
its I™ve gained, in -- from a bu
siness, or other point of view, 
have come  from the U.K., and were -- it never 
gonna happen, but were England to call, I would 
have to assume  that I™d have to do some thing, mo
re than for anywhere else, because of that. But 
do I believe they all did it because they thought
 we were the greatest thing, no, I would imagine 
they did it because we were a damned inconveni
ence. But it was -- but they were good enough to 
do it, in whatever way. And whether some body pe
rsuaded them, or some body put some  pressure 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
90 
 
 
on, doesn™t ma tter. It only requ
ires good people to stand up and some thing can happen. The other 
argument, if good people stand up and do nothing, bad things happen.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Right. I would imagine I™m being very, perhaps 
coldly logical in --  an
d -- and -- and in ma ny 
ways I can follow that because I an -- my fath
er was, you know, very Prussian in hi s ways, you 
know, really. And I can understand those feelings, b
ecause actually I was born in -- in what was 
Prussia then, because Prussia didn™t become a non
-country until after the war, I think ™47 or ™48, 
when they decided to eliminate the country as a c
ountry. So I can feel these things. This is not an 

inheritance of one generation. We
™re talking back generations he
re, you know. When I got called 
up, my mother -- my mother sort of said, ﬁYeah, 
that™s that German instinct,ﬂ you know, got to 
go back into the military again. And my father 
said nothing and we all 
laughed, but underneath 
it, perhaps my mother had a point, y
ou know. I didn™t go unhappily, you know. No -- 
Q: You didn™t try to 
be singled out -- 
A: Not a chan - not a way. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was my turn now, and to b -- as -- you know,
 so I -- and I don™t want to mi nimi ze that, I™m 
not talking glory here, but this was different. Do 
I think these things can happen again?  I suspect 
so. Do I feel that things could have been done
 better?  Yes, I do. How 
can I change that?  I™ve 
taught my kids about that.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I™ve not -- I™ve never tried to impose too much 
on it, I wanted them to have a norma l life, as 
norma l as I could ma ke it, and as normal as I got 
it. And I am grateful to 
my parents, or to my 
father in particul ar, for not putting me into th
is position of having to try and almost rethink 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
91 
 
 
everything [indecipherable] continuous, as we talked
 about earlier. But I™ve always said to my 
kids, you know, my daughters, if 
you have to do some thing, don™t do it at the last mi nute, do it 
when it™s easy, when there™s no pressure, if that
™s what you want to do. Cause some times when 
you want to do some thing, it ma y not be possible.  
Q: [indecipherable] wait. 

A: Yeah, don™t wait and -- to have some thing done. 
If it™s importan
t -- if you think it™s important 
enough. I find it some time s very hard to understand how my  -- my fa mi l y, my father™s family 

and my mother™s family, male and female, male
 more than anything else because they™re the 
ones who had the -- the greatest education, and I 
mean a really good education, could not have 
seen the writing on the wa ll. I mean, I have in 
my father™s docume nts, I found them, the date on 
which he was ma de a barrister, or sign [indeci
pherable] under Prussia. The date when he was 
ma de a commissioner of oaths and all these. A
nd attached underneath, the date when he was -- 
the -- the -- the -- the --
 Hitler, under governme nt regulations, 
starting in 1933 to ™34, rescinded 
all these things. And I™ve of
ten askedmyself, my God, 
if you saw that, what -- 
Q: F-Four or five years went by. 

A: That™s right. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Exactly right. My -- my fath
er was a lawyer, my Uncle Hugo, 
his eld -- my father™s eldest 
brother worked in the financial institution, in 
a bank. I -- I don™t know the name  of the bank. My 
mother™s brother was a lawyer, although he neve
r practiced law, per se. But I think he got a 
doctorate in law as well, he was a -- he -- he 
liked studies [indeciphera
ble] and my daughter 
seems to take after that as well, my eldest
 daughter. Anyway, I -- 
and sud -- funny enough, so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
92 
 
 
does my young daughter now graduall
y, it di -- just takes in diffe
rent ages [indecipherable]. But 
how could they not have seen this?   
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: My mother tells me  that they had a meeting, 
but I wasn™t part of th
at meeting, you know, I -- I 
was born, but I wasn™t like we™re discussing here, so
 I can™t really say what actually took place. 
You know, how did they discuss it, what did they
 discuss?  I suppose the 
question probably was 
raised is what are we going to do?  And where 
do we go?  One thing is, I suspect, when -- when 
we didn™t get into the United States
, or United States ma de no effort
, or -- or Canada, because th 
-- they were the next two -- the tw
o countries closest, is that the 
Germans must have chuckled to 
themselves and said, ﬁWell, you see, if they don™
t let them in, there™s only 1100. And then what 

you -- you -- no wonder what we™re doing is right.ﬂ 

Q: Right. 

A: Okay?  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Then I have to ask the question, we ll why 
did the other countries 
do it, okay?  Holland™s 
always had that reputation for gi
ving sanctity to -- sanctuary, I be
g your pardon, to -- to refugees. 
The -- France, I™m not quite sure, 
even to this day in
 my mi nd -- I™m a bit ambivalent about 
France, I can -- was it Belgium agreed as well? 

Q: I think so. 

A: Yes, I™m not quite -- I don™t know enough about 
Belgium. Britain always opened it™s doors to 
refugees in the old days. Course the old days were
n™t so old any more at that time , oka y, but they 
did it. For whatever reason, they did it. Nobody 
else did it in Europe. And the Germans must 

have been saying to themselves, well hoora
y, we can go full steam ahead, cause nobody™s gonna

save these guys. Is that a co
rrect assessment?  I do
n™t know. I have pondered about this. I would 
have to tell you that I became -- I™ve become very
 cynical about platitudes of all descriptions. 
I™m skeptical. I want to see the deeds done. And 
of course there are good
 me n who stand up. But 
some ti me s they get overwhelmed by other people
 who say, it™s not my business, it™s not my 
affair, and really, I don™t want to get i
nvolved. I don™t know the 
answer to that.  
Q: But the -- 
A: You know, and -- and -- and -- and it™s, you 
know, not sure whether that™s answered your 
question correctly. I -- I -- I don™t
 think the St. Louis is the on
ly motivating factor in my 
comments to you. I could say to you that nobody came up 
to my parents or to my fat her and said, 
I know you were a barrister, now you can™t practi
ce law -- this was after they got in England -- 
I™ll help you get a job. Which must have been
 very tough for him. But on the other hand I 
recognize also that we landed, were accepted,and left alone. Nobody bothered us, nobody threw 

stones at us. Nobody bis -- painted signs on the -- 
on the doors. Th -- the -- the homes we all 
lived in, or rented, were all 
owned by non-Jews. Nobody ma rched out
side to chastise that person 
or us.  

Q: No. 

A: Not that that would have 
happened anyway, the police would have been round there norma lly 
in those days, even to this day. But what I™m 
getting at is people c
ould turn around and say, you 
were lucky. And I suppose we were, because I 
suspect strongly that those people who, for 
whatever reasons, went to Europe, to the count
ries, all of which were overrun by Germany, not 
all of them survived.  

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
94 
 
 
A: In fact, I would have to anti
cipate, I don™t know the figures, and 
we did talk about this earlier 
yesterday, I have a very great fee
ling that most of them -- there 
are survivors, but
 I don™t think 
they survived in -- I mean, from
 my perspective,we didn™t ha
ve a lot of money, but we had 
clothes, and sho -- and en-enough food to eat, whet
her it was -- whether we had -- we didn™t have 
meat every day, but we were on rationing like ev
erybody else in England. But it didn™t seem to 
affect my health. I was accepted at sc
hool, nobody questione d me , nobody criticized me , no 
teacher made derogatory remarks. And when my
 parents in -- or my mother in the begi nning, 
went to see a teacher in her broken English, nobody 
laughed at her or  -- or denigrated her, or 
talked about her. So perhaps we ha -- we have so
me thing to be grateful for, but have I become  

cynical?  I suppose so, a little bit. More so 
than the St. Louis, do you understand?  Cause we 
survived the St. Louis. 

Q: Right. 

A: I -- I -- it™s -- it™s -- 
Q: It™s hard to pull that out and -- and -- and is
olate it, and asking to form a n opinion about that. 
A: I wasn™t -- 
Q: I understand about -- 

A: -- yeah, you see, I™m sure that it must have b
een terrible for my parents, and my gra ndfather, 
not knowing in those -- in that pe
riod when the ship turned aro
und and we arrived in England, or 
it was finally determined that we could go. A
nd obviously, when my fat her ma de the decision, 
my grandfather must have ma de the s -- followed. I mean, it would have been ridiculous if he 

had gone some where else, but he could have 
done, I mean, he was his own ma n. He didn™t. 
Thank goodness. He -- we all -- perhaps they disc
ussed it, and my -- or my father may have 
talked to my  father -- grandfather about it, a
nd said, ﬁI™m going, we™re going to do this.ﬂ And he

mi ght have said -- they mi ght have agreed on th
at. I don™t know. It was never discussed. But it™s 
very hard for me  cause I was not part of th
at conversation, and you ask me  perhaps -- and you 
started off at the beginning by sort of saying some
times parent s try to shield thei r children, what 
could I have contributed to it, you know?  I™m sure
 my father didn™ttalkto my mother about 
Buchenwald, or what little --

Beginning Ta pe Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continue -- this 
is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John 
Meyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on July fi
rst, 2004, in Washington, D.C. This is tape 
number four, side A. 
A: I can recall that on odd occasions -- certainly not by my father because he never di scussed 

those things, but my mother, when we talked abou
t the St. Louis, or she me ntioned it to other -- 
generally Ge rman refugees earlier in the war, 
when they got together in -- in Bedford, you know, 
three or four people, or some thing, they would -- 
or they would talk to each other and -- and the 
St. Louis mi ght well come  up. I don™t recall my mo
ther ever saying to me , or in her presence, 
because they were always -- and I was always 
taken along at these things, because they had 

nowhere to leave me , my  mother, and didn™t want
 to leave me  anyway. And -- and so she would 
be talking in German, and when she me ntioned th
e St. Louis, I don™t ever recall her saying that 
she had, on the St. Louis, an unpleasant experience
, any of the crew, or the staff, or anybody was 
rude to her. Now usually, if some body was rude, 
or crude, or showed impatience or some thing, 
I™m sure she would have ma de a comment about
 that. My mo -- my mothe r  was rather me-
me ticulous a-about that sort of 
thing. I never heard her say anyt
hing which was like a derogatory 
scenario. Obviously, of course, it was from the --from the point of view of where we were going 

to land, was serious. But I don™t reca
ll her ever mentioning that -- th
at the people as -- the staff of 
the -- of the crew, either
 on the way out, or on the way back to
 Europe, were unpleasant, as far as 
she was -- a -- as some thing which she could ha
ve said had impacted upon her. Now, whether 
that happened with -- you know, in the same  wa
y to -- to 999 other pa
ssengers, I don™t know, and 
I can™t say, you know. But in that context, that™s 
perhaps another way of 
trying to explain to you 
that, you know, the -- for me  -- for -- I think for my
 parents it was always the question of where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
97 
 
 
would they end up. Because don™t forget, my fa ther probably -- I mean this is not a -- we don™t 
have a piece of paper saying that, but I™m pretty 
sure that for my father, he was under notice, as 
must -- must have been my grandfather, if you 
are not out of Germany within some  things, we 
will be back for you and Buchenwald will be even worse than it already is. Now, on the other 

hand, I have the Red Cross letters, of which my 
gr andmother on my father™s side was still alive 
and writing to us in April of 1942. We received it 
in June ™42, okay. Now, in the same  year, in 
September, she was transported to Theresienstadt
, and died a month late
r, we just got that 
confirme d yesterday, okay, here. I just had 
that -- your -- your -- your -- your colleague 
downstairs, Steve oh, whatever it is, found it out
. And it™s taken me  a long time, you know. How 
ma ny -- over half a century to find that out. So
 how did these things happen, it™s -- it™s 
conceivable that the people would have rema ined
 where they were for awhile, before all these 
really horrendous things, in te
rms of transportation, death cam
ps, came along. In other words 
was building up, but it didn™t happen in -- in one
 month. I™m not trying to mi nimi ze that, okay. 
So it™s possible that my parents c
ould have lived in Halle from so
mewhat longer. But I think that 
my father was under sent ence, if you follow what I™m getting at. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I™ve often wondered how he got out of Buch
enwald. You know, y -- I -- and I -- I -- I™ve -- 
I™ve -- I -- I -- the only rea -- a
nd there™s nothing on paper, and 
he never discussed it, but I™ve 
read documentation to say that, you know, World Wa r 
1
 veterans were -- were released with an 
understanding. However, I™ve also pondered my fa
ther being -- having been the outside counsel 
for I.G. Farben, and knowing so ma ny people in 
Halle, in -- in -- where 
his career was. And my 
mother would tell me  that even in -- even in -- 
in the period between hi -- ™33, and perhaps up to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
98 
 
 
-- up to the -- ™38, they would have like -- they ca
ll it in -- in German -- in -- in -- in German, it 
was like a -- the equivalent of 
Bridge scart and once a week -- 
Q: The equivalent of what? 
A: It™s -- it was a car
d game , like Bridge. 
Q: Oh. Oh, oh, oh.  

A: And per -- I don™t know whether it™s weekly or
 monthly, my mother would have -- the -- it 
would be arranged that my parents -- a combin
ation -- my father had his business on a fourth 
floor of an apartment building. Half the fi -- a 
-- the floor, was the apartment for living and the 
other half was his private practice. And the -- yo
u know, this would be a table of four and six, 
and she would have a buffet done. This is afte
r Hitler still is around, can
 you beat this, you know. 
And I s -- used to ask -- I asked her [indecipherabl
e] I said -- I said, ﬁAnd they were all Jewish 
people? ﬂ And is -- no, there mi ght have been 
a couple of Jews, and the rest were, you know, 

people from either a judge or 
some body else, who were not Jews
. And my -- my -- I do recall my 
father saying to me , that had things got very 
bad, he had already ma de arrangeme nts with people 
he knew, who would take me  -- and they were 
obviously all known Jewi
sh people, and -- but it 
never came up, okay. Now who they were, what they were, I don™t know. And I™ve often 

wondered whether some  of these people ma y 
not have -- you know, they were not, you know, 
they were pretty senior people in the city of -- I suspect [indecipherabl
e] people who were known 
in the city, you know, if it was -- 
if it was legal or otherwise, wh
ether that didn™t help him get 
out, you know. You can™t tell, you know. It™s 
-- it™s a strange -- I don™t know.  
Q: These are questions 
that you™ll always have. 
A: Yeah. And I don™t know the answers -- 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
99 
 
 
A: -- to those, and then 
nobody™s alive to
 this day. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. I wanted to ask you about this 
-- this is sort of a museum kind of centered 
question, but since you received this notice that 
this search was going on for survivors, and 
you™ve come into contact with all this informati
on and been thinking about it, and ma ybe in -- in 
a different kind of way, or thr
ough a different kind of lens, and come  here to Wa shington, and 
you™ve answered this question partially, but how
 has this brought you either any kind of new 
understanding, or specifi c kind of infor mation a
bout your family that otherwise ma y not have 
happened to you? 
A: That™s it -- you™ve got -- there™s seve
ral questions in that one question. 
Q: I know, I know. 

A: New und erstanding? 

Q: No. 

A: I™d have to say no. I can™t understand it to this day.  
Q: Okay. 
A: Okay. What I -- what has happened is, in co
ming here, and -- and -- and through the generous 
help of people like yourself and others, I™ve managed, after all these ye
ars, on behalf of my 
cousin in Australia who is in he
r 80™s now, to get closure on my 
grandmothers. I have a -- I have 
a -- a date on which she died. So we now know where she died, and on the day in which, cause 

you know, it -- it turns out the Germans were
 me ticulous, it seemed, in stating -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- where the dates are. That was my ma in r
eason, I have to be truthful with you. I can™t do 
anything about the St. Louis. I didn™t initiate 
the project, you™re initia
ting the project, or the 
museum, and I think it™s great. A
nd it -- and -- but I have to say 
to you, there™s not muc h I can -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
100 
 
 
Q: Gain from it. 
A: -- gain, because even though I was on it, fr
om my personal experience it wasn™t horrendous. 
At least I don™t think it was. I can™t answer 
for my parents any more, because they™re dead. 
Whether I ca -- and they really ma de no reference to
 the St . Louis -- St. Loui
s, other than it was a 
voyage. And they couldn™t get into Cuba, and they
 couldn™t get into the States. We ll, Cuba was 
really their -- the -- the -- the -- the we igh station, if you want
 to put it that way. I don™t know, 
you know, beyond that I don™t know. I -- I™m glad that
 I -- I got acquainted 
with you all, because 
the -- the people here at the muse
um are doing their best to answ
er some other questions. I got 
my first answer yesterday. I think I posed three qu
estions -- actually four, but three of the more 
serious ones. My fourth question 
really was to the museum, what 
are you planning to do with all 
this, you know, as far as the St. Louis is concerned, 
but that™s not a -- that
™s not a -- a -- a family 
issue, okay, in that context. I had three se
rious questions. The fi
rst one got answered. 
Q: About your grandmother. 
A: About my grandmother. And was -- my cous
in, I al-already guessed, we had no closure date. 
So this means I don™t have to -- to 
-- to -- to -- to have a -- a wh
at do they call it, a plaque put up 
some where else to do th -- I do now know where sh
e is, okay, and I can, in -- in -- in any little 
fa mily book, I can put down died so and so, oka
y. How she died, I don™t want to think about. I 
suspect that there™s a -- she was 
only in her mi d-70™s, people live 
to much older ages these days. 
So why should it have happened, how could it have
 happened?  I don™t even ask those questions, 
cause I won™t get any answer, a
nd all I™ll do is ma ke myself an
gry. If you -- if you understand. 
Q: Sure. 
A: Okay. So I™ve got closure. What I really w
ould like to do, perhaps on my father™s behalf, is 
find out what happened to his 
elder brother, and that™s 
going to be a lot harder. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
101 
 
 
Q: Hugo. 
A: Yeah, now he obviously died early in -- and 
in -- where, and under what circumstances, we 
don™t know. My mother always said that he had sort 
of fled eastwards. But if he fled too far east, 
how did he end up getting a cable -- how did he 
get to find out where we were in London to send 
us a telegram?  And why did he end up comi ng back 
the other way, and dying in
 a -- as a result of 
quote unquote, the term hospitalizat
ion which my grandmother, well, it wa s typed out for her, 
and we have to ask what that means. How would 
she have known about that so early in the war, 
okay?  So where was he, if she™d have known 
that. I mean, I can™t 
believe that everybody 
[indecipherable] these unoccupied 
territories would have been so 
keen to start sending out. And -
- and I think the museum has me ntioned that it™s 
really more in Germany t hat all these things 
were kept me ticulously, you know. Ju
st as well they were now today, because that me ans we can 
trace them, and we can complain about them, a nd -- and -- and quote for some  people, perhaps it 

may give them some cla i m in their old age wher
e they mi ght need the restitution which they™re 
entitled to. But I don™t know, 
that™s really what I™d want to ge
t out of this thing, and I™m not -- 
and because if y -- I hadn™t been made aware of
 this, and I didn™t even
 see it in the -- I -- you 
know, the Washington Post isn™t read daily by ev
erybody overseas. And it isn™t read everywhere 
daily in the United States, you know. 

Q: That™s right. 

A: We  winter down in Houston in -- for three months with our daught
er, younger daughter who 

lives there permanently, and we had the Houst
on Chronicle delivered to us every day, so you 
know, I wasn™t rushing out to get the WashingtonPost. And I didn™t -- wasn™t aware of it, even 

though apparently it was advertised in other papers
, and a friend of ours, who is actually the -- 
the godfather of our younger daughter 
in Houston, who lives in -- he
re in -- and worked as a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
102 
 
 
we met each other years ago in -- overseas, and he became -- he and his wi fe became godparents 
to my daughter. He was in the foreign service, 
and we™ve kept in touch over the -- over the time , 
and he called me , and said, ﬁDid
 you know about this?ﬂ I said no. 
He said, ﬁYou haven™t seen,ﬂ -
- I said, ﬁWe ll, I don™t normally take the wa -- Wa
shington Post.ﬂ I said, ﬁThe easiest one to get, 

where we are, is actually the New York Time s, actually.ﬂ 

Q: New Yor k Time s.  

A: And I™m not trying to denigrat
e the Wa shington Post. But I sa
id, ﬁI didn™t see anything like 
that in the Wall Street Journal,
ﬂ I get that every day on my doorst
ep at six in the mo rning at 
home , and -- with our other papers -- and he sa
id, ﬁI™ll send it to you.ﬂ A
nd that™s where it all 
started. But for me  at that junc
ture, it was important because your colleagues here all offered to 
be of help if they could, which was very gene
rous and I appreciate that very much. The other 
thing is, it wasn™t until my mo
ther died, in 2001, that I got 
a chance to go through all these 
papers, cause up to that time , she wa s really 
-- kept them boxed, bagged, and everything else. 
And it was quite a di fficult process, because when you consider when th -- their ages when they 

both died -- so the Germans didn™t win that 
game  -- it was almost a hundred years of 
documentation. And the very serious things were 
all in Germa n, and in 
all German writing. You 
know, not the Roma nized way we see it today, y
ou know [indecipherable] we™re talking about. 
And I™ve had to really, pi ece by pi ece, and it wasn™t 
until last year that I we
nt -- that I took back 
with me , or went through the li -- in Engla
nd, the last box of papers
 and pictures, which 
some body very gener -- kindly and generously ke
pt for me , you know. You know, it™s -- it™s not 
easy to take things back in bags, 
and all the rest of this, you know -- 
Q: No, I can™t imagine it, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
103 
 
 
A: -- you understand. And so that has, to some  de
gree, sparked off. And then when my cousins 
asked me on both sides to submit these claims, I then
 really had to dig into this ma terial. Luckily, 
I had it now, but it™s still very time  consuming, be
cause the answers aren™talways there. So then 
when this thing came up, at the end of last year, 
al -- I thought to myself
 -- perhaps I™m being a 
bit selfish here, perhaps this is 
a way in which I can get some  answers, not so much for claims or 
anything else, but on what happened to my gra
ndmother, which I did. Wh at happened to my 

Uncle Hugo. Those were the two -- 

Q: Right. Pressing -- pr
essing questions for you. 
A: -- priority questions actuall
y. I am a little skeptical about 
what I get [indecipherable] mi nd, 
because even downstairs in the museum, the peopl
e who deal with that, the ones who found what 

happened to my grandmother said it™s very -- th
at could prove to be 
very, very difficult, you 
know. And why would he have been rounded up
 imme diately, that™s you know, do you under -- 
do you follow? 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: You know, the real serious round
-ups -- I me an my grandmother wasn™t -- wasn™t deported to 
Theresienstadt until 19 -- 1942. The war broke out 
in ™39, if Hitler was pu
tting all the Jews in, 
why didn™t they all go in wa -- in one fell swoop? So
 I don™t know. It™s -- it™s very confusing. But 
who s -- who knows what [indecipherable]. I -- I -- 
I don™t know how other 
than to answer you -- 
that question, and then put some
 of these things to rest.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: I™m -- I™m not a great believer in dwelli
ng indefinitely on these things, me ntally and 
physically, it doesn™t do you well. 
I can™t -- I couldn™t stop it the
n, I can™t stop -- stop it now. I 
don™t want to leave my daughters 
with an inheritance of trying
 to find some thing. They know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0487  
104 
 
 
where they came  from. They know how they got fr
om A to B, they know who their parents are, 
they know who their grandparents are,
 they both me t the -- one set 
of grandparents, okay. They -- 
they know from pictures and everything else wher
e they came from, and how far they can -- they 
can trace back their particular roots -- 

Q:  Pret t y  far. 

A:  Pret t y  far. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So they really don™t need to do chasing. It
™s not easy, and some ti me s 
it™s really quite -- how 
can I put it?  Draining. You know, fo
r the simple reason that readi
ng or looking at these things 
can ma ke people very angry. And I must admit 
it causes me some anger. Other people view it 

differently, so perhaps I™m being a little bit self
ish in having the museum 
do these things for me . 
If this is a way in which I can, from my point of
 view, to aid what you™re
 talking about, do this 
oral history, of which the St. Loui
s is a part, then it™s -- it™s 
my way of saying thank you very 
much. And I think it™s worthwhile, but how much 
the contribution is to future generations, I™d 
like to believe that it will be, but
 I™ve lived and worked in quite a few parts of the world, and I™ve 
had to step in ironically on behalf
 of others, purely as a westerne
r in some  parts of the world, for 
people who came -- I someti mes -- I -- I™m perhap
s -- I say to myself 
-- you know, I -- let™s hope 
that these things don™t happen ag
ain, irrespective of -- 
to whichever group of people or otherwise 
-- and that™s about as much as I can say to you. 

Q: Okay. Well, thank you. I wish you 
good luck on the rest of your search. 
A: Thank you. 

Q: And this concludes the United States Holo
caust Memorial Museum interview with John 
Meyerstein. Thank you.
