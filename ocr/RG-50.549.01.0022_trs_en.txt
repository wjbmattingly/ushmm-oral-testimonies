Q: Okay.  If you want to
 st op the tape at any time, just let me know.
 
A: Oh that's okay.  I'll manage
.  I'll manage.  I didn't talk 
for many, many years.  I did 
not talk .  When my kids starte
d to understand, more
 or le ss, I just did not talk what I 
went through.  I tried to have 
good times.  I tried 
to forget.  I tried 
to, I blocke
d out.  I 
just didn't want to in
flict the pain.  I was 
in so much pain, deep-knee, that I didn't 
want t o inflict on my c h ildren.  I s uf f er ed 
so much as a child and
 when the k i ds wer e  
born, t h ey were my whole lif e
.  I didn't expect to
 be aliv e, I didn't expect to ge t 
married, I didn't expe
ct to have children.  And when 
this, God gave me two kids, it's 
just, why should I put the pai
n on them?  It's not enough th
at I we nt through?  This  
is  all I have now.  I lost 
my m ot her , my s i st er, a brot
her who wa s one 
year younger, 
a s ist er who was fiv e year s y ounger than I wa
s.  And j ust t o put 
this kind of pain on 
my children, I said no
.  When they'll grow up, they'
ll go to school, I 
raise them as 
Jewish.   I'm not orthod
ox but I am very much Jewish or
ie nt at e d, a l l m y  lif e in t h is  
country.  I gave my li
fe to Judaism.  I work for the ZOA.  My name is quite known in 
the ZOA.  Florence Ei
sen, Fanny Eisen.  I give big donat
ions.  I love Is
rael, it is my 
life.  Anything that was for 
Israel I raised millions of 
dollars for Isra
el, for bonds, 
UG A, they all know me.  Bu
t t o t e ll the c h ildren about 
t he ghetto and t h e war,  and 
what I went through, I just, I 
stopped right there.  I didn't want
 to do it.  I couldn't.  I 
couldn't put this  pain
 on t h em.  I  want  t hem  to gr ow
 up not t o know what m o ther 
went t hr ough.  But t o be happy.  To gr ow
 up as Am er ic an, no
rmal children.  I was 
not normal.  I didn't grow up normal.  I 
didn't have a normal 
upbringing.  From 
twelv e y e ar s of age, s i nc e 1939, and I j u st 
wanted, that's all I ha
ve is  my kids, an d 
to let them lead a normal li
fe.  Let them grow up like
 all the other Am eric an next-
door c h ildr en.  Not by  a mo
t her who is always wor r ied. 
 I did put m y ov er pr ot e ction 
ov er t h em.  I did.  I didn't  le
t them  swim .  I didn't  let them
 play ball.  I didn't let them, 
food wa s always eat, eat, eat.
  Push, put on them.  I kn
ew my abnormality.  I knew 
it, but I couldn't help 
it.  Now, they're now in scho
ol, and then they went to High 
Sc hool and college, th
ey know Grandmas, they call 
me Babba, overprotection of 
them.  Ev en up until now, I st
il l don't wa nt them to ride a 
bike.  I just can't bear for 
them to get hurt in 
any way.  I n any way 
I can't bear for them 
to get hurt.  Now I 

have grandchildren 
s o I am even mor e ov er prot ect i ve.  
 But now we talk
 about it.  As 
soon as my kids, my 
grandchildren, not to my children.  They st
art to go to school 
and of course it  came
 out, schools talk about 
it.  I was able more 
to talk about it. 
They called me, there'
s not, my children live in Conn
ecticut and when they started 
High School, even, when 
_________ public schools th
ey wr ote about their 
gr andm a.  In s c hools,  and I'm  s u re y o u k
now that they say, you know, you have 
grandparents?  Tell me a
bout you're grandpa
r e nts.  They always say t hat my 
grandparents are survivors but 
I don't know much 
about them.  They 
called me into 
Connecticut, to schools.  I talk
ed a little bit about it.  I 
told them.  Th
ey wrote about 
my life.  They always
 got A's,  always got A's.  When 
t hey gr aduat ed,  my older  one' s  
bar m itz vah, and it was like 
some kind of  a Fr
iday night, they ca
lled me, I wen t  
there.  I t old them what I 
would like to do.  Th
ey brought the whole school children. 
I told them that I want to te
ll t h em  how luc ky they are t h
at they were born here and 
rais ed here and educ
ated here.  They didn'
t have to go throug
h what gr andm a wen t  
thr ough.  And how ov er prot ect iv e  I am ov er
 them.  Wit h  bot h boy s I did t hat, bot h 
boys .  And really t h ey t a
k e pr ide in me.  They ta
k e pr ide in m e for that.
 
Q: Let's talk about you're children
 and you're family life a li
ttle bit later 
on.  Let's go 
back  to t h e stor
ies that . . .
 
A: To the ghetto?
 
Q: . . . now you're be
ginning to talk to them about 
t h es e st or ies.   W hy  don' t  we 
start ?
 
A: St art to talk about the children?
 
Q: Yes, st art when y o u were a c h
ild.  Let's talk of you're
 experiences in the ghetto 
and j ust giv e, f irst of all, 
you're name then, how old you 
were, and a little bit about 
you're family and 
then we can talk about the ghetto.
 
A: Okay.  Actually the war 
for me started in 
1939 when the Russian
s came in.  I n  
1939.  I was born in
 1928.  My name 
then was Fagel Giterm
an.  Fagel was my 
Jewish name, Giterm an was my father's name.  A family of  five, my father , my 
mother, three children.  I'
m the oldest of the three. 
 My br other  was one year  
younger, my sister five year
s younger.  Also 
lived with us a gr
andma, my father's 
mot her , who was an old, love
ly lady.  And in 1939, w
hen the Ru ssia
ns came our 
lives started to change.  
My father wa s a barber, 
he gave the kids a good 
educat ion, he wor ked ver y, v er y hard.  M y
 mot her nev er wor k ed.   In Eur ope, in 
thos e year s ,  wom e n didn't  wor k.  They t ook
 car e of  the childr e
n and we lived in a 
small stet-ill (ph) by 
the name of Lock-mul
 (ph), not far from 
Pease (ph), from Mun-
yeah-yetz (ph), itâ„¢s
 a stet-ill (ph) 
but a nice stet-ill (ph), wi
th a beautiful you-gont 
(ph), beautiful, beautiful young crowd of peopl
e wh ich, I didn't even know them yet 

bec aus e I was what ?  I was 
born in 1928 and 
this  was 1939, I 
wa s eleven years 
old, right ?  About elev en y ear
s old.  And t he war st art e d al
ready.  They sent us to 
school.  They put us lik
e a year younger.  I felt as a child
 that life starte
d to be hard. 
Any w ay, t w o y e ars t he Rus s ians were ther e.
  It wasn't too bad. 
 Then, in
 1942 I 
think, the Germans came.  
As a child, I was a curious 
child.  I us e t o, we had a 
radio.  So me people didn't have
 a radio, we did have a ra
dio.  We use to sit, my 
fat her  us e t o sit by t h e radio and listen wh
at's going on the wo rl
d.  And I was hiding 
and listening.  I was unhappy.
  I was very unhappy.  
It made me very
 unhappy.  I 
cr ied a lot.  Then they started to talk abou
t t hey ar e going to go 
to a ghetto
, they ar e 
going t o put us  in a ghett o. 
 We lived like, we 
had our own house,  and we lived lik e  
outs kirts of  my town.  And t h
ey are going t o  put us lik e  
in t h e m iddle of t he t o wn.  
They divided the ghetto, this  
is only what I 'v e hear d t a
lk ing fr om  the gr own-ups.  
Like their going to divide th
e town, not the town, but in
 the m iddle of the m ar r ick  
(ph) they use to call it, middle of the city 
or  t he town or the st et- ill ( ph), and t h ey 'r e 
going t o put us in t h e ghetto.  I  remem ber
 what they gave us , a buggy and a hors e .  
They didn't give us, my fa
ther had to borr ow it  from
 the next door, a peasant, non-
Jewish people.  But they had a 
good pull you put on it and 
I walk ed in the back.  I 
look ed at  my house.   I cr ied.  I r em emb
er like now.  This  wa
s 1942, I m u st hav e  
been fourteen I guess. 
 I cried my eyes out. 
 I look ed t o the hous
e.  I said, "where 
ar e we going" ?  Any w ay,  they 
took us ther e.  My father
 had a st epbr ot her in t h is  
partic ular ghetto.  T
here wer e t w o ghett o s s p lit in ha
lf and we were 
in one ghetto, 
not far fr om  the Shul ( p h).  
And he had a big hous e, but t h
ey gave us a small room. 
And t h is s m all room,  ver y sm all, tiny, m a
ybe, my father made
 bunk beds.  And 
there wer e  fiv e people, and my  gr andm a 
was s i x, and t h ey put an ot her c ou p le 
there, an elder ly c o uple, and they  als o 
had like a bunk bed.  
An d that's how we 
liv e d ther e.  We wer e t here fr om, it must
 hav e  been ar ound Pac er side ( p h), bef or e  
Pacer side (ph).  So  Pa cer (ph) is usua
lly Apr i l s o met im es, t he end of  Apr il 
probably.  And I didn't know, there wa sn't e
nough food.  I heard my
 father talk about 
trying to get together a you
ng gr oup of people t hat, they  
ar e going t o m ak e lik e  an  
upris i ng and t hey are going t o
 go to t he ot her ghett o.  
I was always kind of, as a 
child I was hiding and crying
 and hiding and reading what
ev er I c ould put m y hands  
on, some books, reading.  
And m y mot h er nev er t a lk ed a 
lot.  She was a nice,  quie t  
lady.  My father was a barb
er and he wa s a good barber. 
 An d him I think, and the 
guy, the other couple that wa
s with us, they ope
ned up a barbers
hop special
 for the 
Germ ans and als o f or the non-J
ews outs ide of the ghett o. 
 And he worked there. 
So he use to brin g in, probabl
y smuggling, hiding, a piece 
of bread, a pi
ece of fish 
or a piece of _________ becaus
e whatever the ra
tion they gave to you it wasn't 
enough.   I  r em ember  a
fter quit e a while,  my  mot her ' s 
walk ing ar ound wit h a pair o f  
swollen feet.  I said, "Ma, wh
at is  it ?".  "O h, 
nothing my  kin, not hing.  Don't worr y  
about, I'm fine."  Later on I 
found out it was from lack of
 food.  She didn't eat. 
What ev er little food s h e had 
she gav e it t o the childr en.
  And she didn't e at it,  she 

got swollen.  She was only th
irty-six years when she went 
to her gr ave.   W h en t he y  
killed her.  Thirty-six years 
old.  And then old 
grandma was with us
.  I was never in  
the kitchen.  I wa s never,
 there was one kitc
hen, it couldn't have been for te n 
family 's  maybe,  I was never in somebody el
se's r ooms.   I  couldn't,  I was just  in 
pain, pain, pain, pain.  I coul
dn't, I was mainly in my ro
om.  I don't even remember 
play ing wit h  childr en.  I don'
t know why.  I was 
just trying to get 
books and read and 
read and stay in bed 
and read.  There was no school, 
of course.  I never went to 
sc hool t h er e in ghet to.   And 
my little sister, I don't reme
mber.  I c a n v i sualiz e them  
very well now, but I never we
nt t o sc hool in 
ghetto.  Maybe ther e was some school, 
I don't thin k so, if  there wa
s any schoolin g there.  And on
e day, they use to send 
people to work.  What 
was the work?  Later 
on I found out, at th
e end.  That they 
us e t o t ak e  a bunch of  people 
from on ghetto, send them 
to a different, out of town  
plac e or out of this, t o anot
her town, dig graves and that's
 how they use to kill the 
people.  They didn't know about us.  Th
ey wanted my mother
, my mother was a 
ver y br av e wom a n, 
and one German was li
k e  aft er  my m ot her .   So inst ead of 
sending my mother to 
work, work means to 
dig the graves for ot
her people, I went. 
I went t o dig thes e gr av es and I  remem b
er  the grav es , they 
was like long, deep 
gr av es.   I was in one gr av
e, digging, and there were 
some other people digging, 
and on the way back they bro
ught us home in tr
ucks.  And it was 
like in the middle, 
this work was always
 done like in the middle of th
e night, like from suppertime 
ar ound, bef or e it got dark, unt i
l lik e t he m i ddle of the night.
 
Q: Did you know w
hat you were doing?
 
A: No.  I really didn
't  k now what  I was  doing.   Bec a us
e I, I had a hunch
 maybe,  but I 
really didn't know.  I 
had no c h oic e .  What ev er  it was 
I had t o dig the gr av e, I wasn' t  
the only one.  Not 
directly, I didn'
t know that this is really  for killing peopl
e, to throw 
people in there.  An d we ca
me home, it must 
have been about 4 or
 5 o'clock in th e 
mornin g.  The ghetto was al
ready rounded, all around.  
There were tr
ucks, there 
were soldiers.  It was like
, t h e ghett o was bar b wir e d 
all ar ound and we looke d  
around and one German
 said, "Well, you're going to
 be killed toni
ght."  And the 
people that were with us, they said, "This 
is it.  I thin k we'r
e going to get killed 
tonight. "  T hey dr opped us  off .   We went
 into the ghetto.  
Everybody was up, it  
start e d to get lik e a litt le light er, ev ery
body was up.  My mot her was  up.  Ev er y body  
was crying and scr eaming.  Bu
t they didn't take anybody 
yet on the trucks yet.  I 
said, "Where's my Dad?
".  Dad wasn't ther
e anym or e and my br ot
her wasn't t here .  
And I c ouldn't stand t he cr yi
ng, t he y e lling, the s cream i
ng.  So I went out of  the 
house and,  exc u se m e for t h e expr ess i on
, to go to the bath
room they had lik e 
boot hs out side.  And you go 
int o  that booth and it was  
like a hole with a seat in 
there so when they dr
opped this  cam e down, and I hid ther e.  I hid, t h at' s why,  
when I saw Shindler's Li
st, I saw myself, that li
ttle girl. That little girl
 who dr opped in 
the, excuse me, in th
e droppings of the people.  I was 
there.  And when 
I saw this, it 

just, I was screaming.  I was yelling, I was cr
ying.  When I saw the movie.  It's true, I 
was t her e.  And I went  in lik e half w ay, I ju
st want ed to dr own and I couldn't dr own.  
All of a sudden, my mother
 came running after me, grabb
ed my hair, pulled me out 
and said, " Y ou c an't do t hat, y ou 
can't do that."  I said, "Ma,
 I can't go on that truck. 
I don't want to be 
killed.  I can't do th
at."  Anyway, she sc
hlepped me into the 
house, she washed me off and
 I hid under the pillows.  
I went into bed and I hid 
mys e lf.  I  c ov er e d my  ey es  and I put t his 
blank et ov er  my ear s.  She s a id, " N o, you 
come out of there." 
 She schlepped me out of there.
  She dressed me and she put  
som e c lot hes on m e and s he s ay s, " L isten,
 my child.  You're 
father and you're 
br other  went t o t h e ot her ghet
to.  They might survive.   Th
ey might not su
rvive.   But I 
want you t o  go t h ere.  Get 
dr ess e d fast."  She dr ess e d me, s h e put som e s hoes on 
me, s h e put a sc hool t h ing on m e  and I st ar
t ed t o r un t o  the ot
her ghetto.  Now why 
didn't I say, "Ma, come with
 m e. "?  W h y didn't I say it
 to my s is t er ?  She was  
running after me.  She said, 
"Take me with you."  I sa
id, "I don't k
now where I'm 
going, I don't know where I'm going."
 
[Mrs. Eis en ov er whel med at 
this point, unable 
to make out what she is saying]
 
She c ont inues:  Who' s going 
to take care of  you're si
ster, my great grandmother, 
old grandma."  Sh e said, "You
 go.   Maybe you' ll s av e yo
urself, maybe."  Anyway, I 
start e d to r un.  The ghett os 
we re closed, they w
ouldn't let me throug
h.  I start e d t o  
beg,  "Let me through, let me
 through.  My father's th
ere."  So one guy opened the 
gate, I was the last pe
rson crossing from 
one ghetto to the ot
her.  And they opened 
the gate, I crossed the street, 
the only one, and they wouldn'
t let me in there.  So I 
started to scream and banging 
and knocking and th
ey let me in.  I went into th e 
other ghetto, ten minutes late
r the ghetto exploded, like ex
ploded.  They started to 
shoot int o t he ghett o.  The hous es wer e on 
fire.  I saw my first 
cousin, he lived in a 
house in the other g
hetto, in the Rabbi's house, I 
saw the Rabbi st
anding, wr apped 
in a talu s (ph), his li
ttle children next to 
him, with their heads 
up.  My cousin, her 
mother was in the ba
ck yelling, "Schmish
-oil, Schmish-oil, Schm
ish-oil" (ph).  There 
was anot her guy next t o him bur
ning, on fire.  And they 
s t art ed t h e s hoot i ng.  T he 
shooting came in like a 
hail.  I didn't see my father.  I 
didn' t  see m y br ot her.  I didn' t  
see anybody.  All of a sudden, 
I got killed.  I got killed, I 
fell and I see people, I loo k  
around me.  I see people lyin
g dead wit h open m o ut hs. 
 Children, blood, flesh, 
piec es r i pped apar t.  And I 'm jus t  lay i ng t her
e.  I said, I touched myself, I said, No, 
I'm aliv e.  I'm not dead.  I fe
ll, I don't know why,
 but I fell and I touc
h myself.  I got up 
and a bunch of yo
ung,  Jewish guys, I t h ink you have
 it  o n t h e r e
cord, somebody 
who was  in the fr ont  t h er e, 
r i pped the gate and t h ey  st ar
ted to run through the town 
into the gardens, straight to
 some woods.  Ev erybody ra
n.  I was  running, I was  
running, I was strong.  I got 
weaker.  I still didn't know
 what happened to me.  And I 
was r unning.  I was r u nning aft er ev er ybody,
 I'm look ing,  may b e I' ll see my f at her, 
my brother, nobody.  I knew
 my mother's not there, th
is I knew.  An d I passed my 

house, we passed the 
house where I lived in
, I looked at it.  
And I ran.  And we 
cam e t o a place by the nam e of Prepitc
h (ph) and I said 
to myself, there's 
som et h ing running in the ba
c k of me.  T h er e' s s om e thing not r i ght about, my 
shoulders are getting weaker, I'
m getting dizzy a little bit. 
 I said, my back is  wet. 
And I looked, I touched my back,
 my behind, and I'm full of
 blood.  A girlfriend who 
liv e d next t o us c am e ov er and s he look ed
 at me and said, " F
anny, you know yo u 
are wounded.  What's the ma
tter?"  I said, "I don't know
."  Sh e said, "You're whole 
wet back is  ripped, the clothi
ng is ripped, I could see an 
open f les h there. "  I s a id,  
"Well, I must have got 
hit in the ghett o by a, y ou know
, when they hit me."  She took 
off her ker chief fr om  her head, she t o ok  
off her shirt, she had
 that little shirt 
under neat h .  Ther e was water ther e, the 
name of the place called Pr epitch (ph). 
She dipped this in the water,
 she wiped me arou
nd, she cleaned me off and she put 
this around me and I 
was okay.  I mean, there wa s a 
wound there.  I didnâ„¢t know 
anyt hing else anym or e.  And 
that 's it.  And I was on t h e 
Pr epit c h (ph), unf ort un at ely  
people are cruel, I guess when th
e Mo-ha-movis (ph) is  in fr
ont of you you're trying 
to save yourself not some
body else.  And the grown up
 people took off.  No bod y  
wanted me.  I was very skinny
.  I didn't look like, I wa
s thirteen-and-a-half I think, 
nobody wanted me.  I was runn
ing after the young males, 
you know, they said, "My 
sist er, m y br other, m y  fat her , my  mot her
, they ar e going t o die and I c an't s c h lep 
here wit h me, I can'
t save m y own lif e.  Go hom e.
"  I said, "W hat  do y o u mean go 
home,  the ghett o was  on f ir e, where am  I 
going t o go?  I  c a n'
t go anyplace, it 's 
burning.  Wher e am I going
 to go?"  Anyway
, I was on my own 
t h er e with s o me,  
one guy who had two small 
children of his own took 
me under his arms.  And 
anot her two k i ds, t hey ar e all aliv e, he 
died, never, 
he shouldn't have died, he 
should have lived foreve r.  An d he got in to
uch with some kind of
 peasant guy.  We 
were there for ab
out a week on 
this Pr epit ch (ph), for ab
out a week.   Do y ou want  
me to . . .?
 
Q: So how many people, let 
me just go over, when you 
lef t  ther e,  when you ran 
from the ghetto, how many
 people wer e y ou wit h ?  
Wer e t her e ma
ny people 
running?
 
A: Running, they were runni
ng for about, out of the Prepitch (ph) there must have 
been around 500 people wh o 
ran away from the ghetto.
 
Q: And did people scatte
r?  Did you go . . .?
 
A: But t h ey  scatter e d all over
 the places, all over the places.  Some, then quit e a 
few weeks later, I was 
traveling, we had t o cross  the 
Prepitch (ph) wi
th some kind 
of a k a yak or som et h ing, ot her wis e we c ouldn
't be over.  And th
is guy who took me 
under his wings, he h
ad two small kids of his own, 
one is  my age and one a bit 
younger.  And he said
 to him, "Well, if 
you're going to take
 care of _________, 
you're going to 
_______ us a little bit. 
 I have li ke a big pot
 of gold hidden behind 

my house.  When the war 
is over, I'll give
 it to you."  It's true, 
he gave it to him, but 
this poor peasant got 
killed for saving Jews
.  They killed him. 
 And we were there 
for about eight days.  This pe
asant use to come, 
lik e ever y body t o ok  off  in diff er ent  
directions, nobody wanted the 
kids.  I'm talking about 
the Jewish people.  Nobody 
want ed us.   And he use t o brin
g,  ev ery day,  lik e a litt le 
fish, cooked fi
sh.  A small 
piec e of br ead.   It m u st ha
v e been f or about 7 or 8 k i
ds  ther e and t h is  gr own- up 
man.  And this is  how we 
survived this  Pr epit ch (ph)
.  And then he said, "Over 
there, on the ot her s i de of t h
e Pr epit c h (ph) ther
e ar e part is ans.  I ' ll t ak e y ou t here ,  
but one at a time."  
It was like a kayak, a 
metal kayak.  And he
 started to, one day, 
like a week later, 
with that whole week.  And th
e G er m ans was lo
oking for us. 
Ther e was  one inc ident.  W e were
 laying, all of us
 together, in the 
woods.  I lost my 
shoes when I was running
, my feet were swolle n.  At  th
at time they ta
ke off, like the 
cor n, a nd it  is s o h ar d,  it 's
 like needles.  And when you ru
n, when I  was r u nning, it  
lik e went through and thr ough
 my feet, and my feet were
 huge and swolle
n.  And it  
was cold already, it was S
ept em ber I think, it
 m ust hav e been Se
pt ember.  When 
did t h ey t ak e off t h e c o rn?  Sept ember, r igh
t?  Af ter the ghetto already, you know? 
So, it was t he end of Septem ber, or Oct
ober, no, September, 
the end of September 
I think.  And he s a ys, and 
I was laying there 
hungry and so
me kids were swollen 
already too, and he said, "I'l
l tak e y o u ov er  there. "  And he t ook  lik e t w o, t hr ee 
people on this  little  kayak and 
he took us over on
 the other side.  Little  by little, it  
must have been abou
t  7 or 8 k i ds.  T h is gr own up 
man, and he should rest in 
peace, he saved my 
life.  Because nobody 
wanted me.  My own 
people, they knew 
me.  "W hy ar e y ou r u nning aft er me?  Go ba
ck to you're mot h er. "
  I said, "I don't 
know wher e t h ey  ar e.   It' s burning, how c
an I go back there?"  
Twice they left me 
sleeping.  I shouldn't 
say it but it's the trut
h.  They left me on a 
stack of hay.  I wake 
up in the m i ddle of the night, 
there's nobody there.  I'm la
y i ng t h ere all by my s elf, on 
the Pr epit c h ( p h), I 'm lay i ng 
t her e all by m y self.   I got up
.  It's dark.  Where am I 
going to go?  I donâ„¢t know, 
so I was listening quietly.  I'
ve heard some 
talking but I 
didn't know for su
r e if  it  wa s G e rma n or
 Yiddis h, but at t h at part ic ular point , I  
couldn't care less.  So I fi
gured if it's Germans, they 
kill me, it's enou
gh.  If Jewis h , 
let' s s e e what' s going t o happ
en.  I followed the vo
ic
es and I got it 
there.  It was th e 
same people who left me la yi
ng under the stack 
of hay.  Twice lik
e this I survived, 
twice.
 
Q: How did you meet up wi
th you're 
father again?
 
A: This was quite weeks la
t er.  I wa s la y in g  in som e
 woods.  Some people went 
away, some people got 
connected with some other gr
oups.  There 
wa s a lot of 
traveling Jews  from different towns.  
Some grown-ups.  They
 knew the wa y and 
they went to look for part
is ans.  I was lay i ng t her e 
wit h anot her woma n and s h e 
had, like a little chil
d, a litt le boy.  And 
I think this, Romanofski's
 (ph) his name, with 
the two girls.  We were
 laying there in a ditch in the 
woods, and of c o
urse I had a lot 

of hair, I had long hair.  Sk
inny I was all my life.  And 
now, aft er week s 
of not eating, 
I could hardly move.  We were
 laying ther e.  "Momm y' s dy
ing."  Al l of a sudden we 
hear, some people hear 
s om e t a lking, either  Yiddis h 
or  Germ an.  So we gav e up ,  
figure, look, whoever is 
going to be there, it 's going to 
be there.  If it 's going to be 
Jews, fine.  If not, if 
it's Germans, you're 
going to be d
ead.  T h ey ar e 
going to shoot 
us out like worms in
 t h is  dit c h and put us t h er e, y o u 
know, get it over with.  And they 
came closer and closer
 and closer.  I can 
hear now, the echo
 in my head.  And they 
were Jewish.  And this Jewis
h,  and ther e was  a m an, ju
st a man.  A f e w men .  
Ther e was a wom a n wit h one c h ild
, I think, too.  And they 
c ame c l oser and I look ed.  
I didn't know if my fa
ther ran.  I knew he
 was  in t he ghett o wher e it was t h e upr is ing,  
but I didn't know if he ran 
away or he survived or he got
 killed running.  Nobody saw 
him running, you know, and n
obody knew if , nobody saw hi
m.  I mean, I didn't see 
anybody.  All of a sudden I 
see my father.  I start yellin
g in Yiddish, "De-tock-n-key, 
de-tock-n-key (ph)".  He 
backed it  up and he looked, he 
didn't recognize me.  He 
said, "De-t o ck- n-key?".   "Don't you recognize
 me?  It's Fagel, you'
re daught er. "  He 
just didn't recognize me.  
He gr abbed m e and t ouc hed 
me and opene d up t h e hair  
ov er m y f ac e, t ook it away, and look ed at 
my face and he started 
yelling, "No, this is 
not my Fagel."  And he passed
 out.  I said, "Oh my God, 
finally I found
 him and now 
he got a heart  attac k and he died. "  He
 didn't recognize me
.  He just didn't 
recognize me at all,  I was li
ke a skeleton.  And lots of 
ha ir , t he  ha ir wa s a l l c o ile d,  
like all over my face.  And 
he pas sed out.   He
 pas sed out, of  c o urs e, we st art e d t o  
yell and scream and pu
t some, ther e was no water ther
e.  I remember we use t o  
squeeze down our food and
 take some moisture out of it
 and t hat ' s what we dr ank .  
We survived, we 
didn't get poisoned.
  And t h at' s what we di
d,  and we tr ied t o,  and  
he wo ke up and he recognized 
m e , of cour se.   And t his is
 how he found me, this is 
how he found me.  An d then he
 said he knew his wa y a litt
le bit around and he said, 
"Well,  let's see what you can 
do now."  And we started to 
walk.  And in the morning, 
when it was light, the 
peasants, they go
 to the fields.  It was field time.  And they  
leave the house open.  So we 
use to go in to the house, 
grab a piece of bread, you 
know, steal.  Steal a potato
.  Sometime we we
nt in, lik e during t h e day we would 
pass by s om e fields  and t h is was lik e 
Septem ber, there wer e  lik e beet s  and 
potat o es and carr ot s.  So we us e to steal
 from the fields and sometimes we stole 
from t h e hous es .   If  we sa
w a house standing 
there, nobody was th
ere,  we ran in 
and we stole a piece of pancak
e, what ever it
 was on t h e t a
ble.  And this is  how it 
was for quite a whil
e, for quite a few months.  And t
hen my father ha
d a prof es sion.  
He as k ed me if  my  br ot her  
wa s running too.  He thou
ght maybe he wa
s running out 
of t h e ghett o, m ay b e he sur v iv
ed.  All his life he wa s look
ing for him, but he didn't 
surviv e.  Later on we found 
out what happened to my brothe
r.  He was running.  He 
ran from the ghetto.  He 
got wo unded very, ve
ry badly.  Worse 
than me. 
 And a 
Germ an c a ught  him  and he s a
id to him, "Run.  Maybe 
you could save yourself .  
Run. "  My  br other  was work ing 
in a st able wit h hors es  in
 the ghetto, so he use to 

bring in like little 
t h ings  fr om an or ange,  a piec e 
of  bread.   And thes e Ger m a n s  
recognized him.  And he st
art e d t o  run and he was weak
er and weaker and weak er  
and he c a me to, like clos e t o my hous e
 wher e he was born, and t h e peas a nts  
recognized him.  And believe 
it or not, they fini
shed him off with st
icks.  They killed 
him with sticks, they fini
shed him off with sticks.
 
Q: At  this point how much 
informatio n did you have when
 y ou f o und y ou'r e fat her 
again and between . . .?
 
[End of Side 1 of T a pe 1]
 
A: . . . to my ghetto.  When
 I walk ed out of ther e, when 
I went out of that ghetto, 
what they did.  Like I di
gged graves for other towns. 
 They, some ot
her towns dig 
gr av es f or my hom et o wn.  And what they di
d, they put all thos
e people on trucks. 
Whoever survive.  I n my gh
etto there wa s not killing, 
I  mean,  in t h e ghett o,  ther e 
was no f ire there.  What they
 did fr om my s i de of t he ghe
tto, they took
 those people 
lik e m y m o ther, my  s i ster,  my gr andm a, 
m y  aunt s, m y  unc l es
, they put them on 
those trucks.  They to
ok  them  t o  this gr av e.   They
 put them, they lined them up 
close to the grave.  They to
ld them to put their clothes 
off and, an old lady of over 
eight y year s of age.   Why ?  
 You ask why?  They t o ok o
ff their clothes, they shoot 
them and they threw them in, 
lik e  ro ws an d r o ws.  Th ey  thre w in o ne r o w, t he y p u t  
this disinfectant stuff, 
I don't know what it 
is, like a white type of
 thing, they put it 
over, then another.  They 
killed another row of Jewish
, all, they had to get 
undressed.  An d shoot them ou
t, throw them into this gr
ave.  This was going on. 
Whoever was there, th
ere must have been about 2 1/2 
thousand people.  I think in 
thes e grav e, I think in t h is gr av e, t her
e is about 1,900 people in t h is gr av e.
 
Q: When did y ou, how did y o
u find out this  inf orm at ion? 
 When did you find that 
out?
 
A: After the liberation, after 
the liberation.  My 
father also knew, li
ke through the war 
we didn't know ex
actly, but my father knew from 
some peasants.  They saw it. 
They were standing there 
wa tching.  There was a lo
t of peasant people standing 
and wat ching.  And t h ey  s a w 
exactly what they were doing.
  But, either they were 
afr a id of  their own s k i n or t h
ey were happy about 
it and they didnâ„¢t
 care.  And what 
could they do if they did 
care?  They'd shoot.  But they saw something like this  
going on, t h ey could have be
en dead too.  If they would 
say one word for the Jews, 
he would have bee
n dead too, the peasant. 
 And t h at 's,  they f i nis h ed it off.   T hey  
said t h at t h e gr av e was up 
and down,  r a is ing, f or  thr ee 
days.  This grave was like 
br eat hing f or t hr e e days,  up
 and down, up and do
wn, up and down.  After the war I 
went  t o t hat  gr av e.  
And it wasn't, it was like droppe
d already, fell already.  Me an d 
some, another two girls.  And we started 
to clean up around and 
I saw these shoes,  
baby's shoes, 
baby's clothes, baby'
s, just like they 
le ft  it  th er e, t h at' s h o w it was  

there.   T h e peasant s didn't t o uc h, t hey h
ad the goym (ph),  they wer e afr a id to c o me 
close to it, I don't k
now.  And we star ted t o
 clean it up and we put  it in bags and 
then I saw little bones and I t
ook off.  I took o
ff.  I left my hometown.  I lived in 
Swooz-k a ( ph) aft er t h e war, I was liber
at ed by Swooz-k a (ph), a town.  It  wa s  
Russian there, like where I 
wa s born it 's li ke the bo
rderline wa s.  Poland and 
Russia.  So I was like
 on t h e Polish s ide of t he bor der
.  And Swooz - ka ( p h) was o n  
the ot her side.  And 
I was liberat ed ther e,
 in Swooz-k a (ph).
 
Q: Let's talk about liberat
ion.  What were you doing?  
You were with y
ou're father? 
Tell me about what you we
re doing, what they daily 
life was like leading up to 
liber at ion?
 
A: Well we were walking.  
We were looking ac
tually for the pa
rtisans because th e 
peasants said that there ar
e part isans .   And being my 
f at her was a bar ber and he 
knew a little bit ho
w to sew, he didn't 
have ammunition on hi
m.  And we wer e  
Jewish.  And we had no ot her c hoic e.  
I mean, we walked 
and we ca
me across 
som e groups and, say they we
r e part is ans,  and he got  in t ouc h with them, he go t  
connected with them.  And they said, well, they
'll take in my father.  At  first, like the 
partis ans in  that area, they 
were organized from Moscow. 
 They use to, they had to 
obey Moscow's orders.  An d in 
real life they were
 not allowed to kill
 Jews, but if the y  
caught the Jews they killed them.  They k
illed a lot of Jews, t
he partisans, a lot. 
And we we re wa lkin g and walk ing and wa
lking, my father 
with his ___________, 
but when he found 
me I was full of lice.  I was like one
 lic e fr om t o e t o head.  And in 
the middle of the night, I re
member like now,  we we nt 
in to somebody'
s house and I 
started to cry, this  is  afte
r he found me, he sa
id, "I have to save my child."  She 
look ed at me, she said, an older  lady, she sa
id, "Oh my God, my 
child, my child. 
What is it ?  What's happening 
to you?"  I was sw
ollen here, I wore 
the same outfit, 
you know, it was hard already fr
om the blood.  And full of
 lice, I had a 
big head of 
hair .  She t ook m e in.  She 
was a nice lady.  An
 older la dy.  She had
 lik e a big,  ho w 
you c a ll it ?  Made out  of wood where 
y o u bat he s om e one, bat he the c h ildr e n or  
bathe a pig, who k nows ?  S
he put in som e wat er t here. 
 My father had
 his, this 
machine that you cut hair off. 
 First of all, the first thi
ng he did he cut off my whole 
head of hair.  The 
li ce were gone.  They put me
 in this ______
_____, how you call 
it ?  In the v a l- it (ph) we us e 
to call it.  And they
 gave me a bath, he
 said, "But I have 
nothing for you to wear
.  I can't giv e y ou anyt hing t o we
ar."  Sh e said, "I'm going to 
giv e y ou some of m i ne."  
So she gav e me s om ething to
 wear, s o met h ing what s he 
was wear ing.  Ev eryt hing, I m e an, pant
ies, those __________ 
panties.  And sh e 
gav e m e a pair  of lop-c hess  
(ph), it 's made out 
of  str a w t o  put on 
my feet.  And she 
said, "I hav e not hing els e.  
It's cold.  How could you wa lk
 on t h at ?"   So s h e wen t  
into her stable and t
here was a big pig ther
e.   And t h e pig was 
covered with a big 
blanket,  it' s lik e a burble, how y ou call it ?
 

Q: Burlap?
 
A: Burlap.  She took it o
ff.  She said, "This 
will keep you warm."  
And she gave this 
to m e, they  gav e me a bat h,
 they cut off my hair.  An
d she s a id, " B ut y o u have t o  
liv e. "  And she gav e m e s o
mething to eat, and 
s h e s a id, "But you have t o leav e my 
house.   You hav e t o 
go.  Go, go, I d
on't want to see 
y ou.  You wer e nev er in m y  
house.  J us t  tak e off bec a us e t hey ar e go
ing to kill me.  The 
Germans are going to 
kill me."  And we 
took off.  That little 
old lady, I'll ne
ver forget too. 
 And we walked 
again, t h e t w o of us , and t w o m or e people.
  And we  wa lked and
 we walked and we 
walk ed, and my father wh o use to walk 
daytime, we use to hide at night.  We 
walk ed and stole a potato.  We
 stole carrots, in 
the woods, I mean in
 the gardens. 
And he used to give the pe
asants a haircut because in  th
os e y ear s t hey 
didn't have 
thos e aut o mat ic r az or s and how to take a hai
r cut.  So they had pi
ty, kind of, for us, 
som e of the peas a nts,  non- Jewis h people. 
 And we walked and
 we  wa lk ed a n d we  
walk ed until we came
 to this particular
 place, close to __
__________, it  took us 
months.  And the 
name of it  wa s Lublin.  And he 
said, "Look, I have a pr of ession. " 
They said, "Do you have ammuni
tion?"  He said, "No.   I d
on't have nothing.  I don ' t 
have a pistol, I don't 
hav e a, I have not h ing. "  He sa
id,  "But  I hav e  a pr of es s i on.  I  
could give you haircuts.  I co
uld s e w.  I ' ll m a ke y ou ja
ck ets ".  You k now,  what ever ,  
jackets from the ship things.  
He said, "But I have
 a child with me." 
 He  s a id , "No.  
We'll take you __________
."  They want
ed to take hi
m in, but not the chil d.  He 
says,  "Well,  I'm  not  going wit h
out the child.  Either you take us both.  I'm sure she 
could be useful, she could 
work."  They had kitchens.
  T h ey  had, we liv ed 
underground, like
 they call it in Russian 
_______________, under
ground.  And 
there were only left over 
soldiers from Russi
a that they took
 off.  When th e 
Germans passed by th
ey were going and there wa s 
no war there actually, th e 
Russians they we
re running, in 
the Ru ssia and the 
G e rmans j u st t ook it  ov er, that' s  
it.  It wasn't any shooting 
ther e.  And s o t hey s a id, y
ou know what, they said, "We 
have a town that, the part
is ans own it .  There's no _
__________ there.  We are 
going to put you're dau
ght er in one of t h os
e houses.  They are 
going to keep her. 
But we're not going to 
tak e her in."  T h ere was no c h ildr en t her e.   And t h ey  did.  

They put me in this 
peasant's house.  For 
some reason,  I must 
have been there for 
quit e a few mont hs, I don't r emember not h i
ng of t h
is part ic ular hous e and wha t  I  
did.  I must have been, I cl eaned probably.  I go to the fi
elds.  I went, as my father 
us e t o tell me lat er on, why 
I bloc ked t his out  I cannot un
derstand.  I ju
st remember 
I slept on t op of an ov en.  And it was s o hot .   Like, th
e cook ing was in
 t he m i ddle 
and t h e ov en was lik e br ic ks.  
And this heat ed of f the whol
e house.  I slept on it.  It 
was impossible.  This pain and 
this burning in my flesh I'
ll nev er  for get.   And als o  
this  hous e had c oc kr o ac hes.   Lot s of t h em. 
 Lots of cockroaches. 
 This I  remember.  
But the r est  of it, what I ate, how I  ate, I 
r eally don't r em em ber.  But of c o urs e they  
needed m y  father f or hair c uts.  He us e to 
se w s om et h in g, f i x s om e th in g.  S o the y  

kept him and he was  
of c our s e  after t h em  to take m e int o, t o br ing wit h him,  
bec aus e who knows?  Here I 
am ok ay wit h t he peas ant s, a m i nut e later t h ey coul d 
give me out.  You know, a German co
uld come in or, 
but ____________ was 
owned by the partis ans.  This 
town wa s owned by the partis an
s.  So I was kind of in 
a safe way but my father wasn't sure.  
And there was no tr ans p
or tat i on.  I didn' t  
know wher e he was, wher e he is
, if he's going to come back to
 pick me up or if he's 
going t o leav e m e t here.  
Bec a us e I saw on the Prepit c
h ( ph) how running people 
left their children to die.  I saw it.  And th
is was in my mind.  
Some of t h em  wer e 
wounded, some of th
em were not wo
unded.  And they left 
them and the parents 
took off.  And this
 was in my mind all my 
life, even when 
I came here
 to this country, 
that my father's going 
to leave m e.  W h ic h he nev er did.
  He was the best father. 
He saved my life.  Not just
 this time, there was other 
inc i denc es, and t he par tis a ns ,  
true, they wanted to kill me
.  And he said no.  But th
is was in my mind because 
what  I  s a w on t he Pr epitc h  (
ph).   T he parent s left t heir c h
ildren.   And o
ne day, all of 
a sudden a buggy came with
 a horse and two sold iers 
and they came
 into the 
house.  But  I stay ed.  And he
 brought me like a 
little, he made it, he
 put it together 
for me, from wool, sheepskins. 
 Like a little jacket.  And 
he br ought  me a pair of, put  
toget her fr om litt le boot s, y ou k now?  And 
he put me on that w
agon and he took  m e  
to the partisans.  I was usef
ul there actually.  I peeled 
potatoes.  I we
nt into the 
kit c hen, t hey had an or ganized k it chen for t h
e soldiers.  I went in
to t hat k itc hen at 2 
o' c l oc k in the m or n ing, 1 o' c l oc k,  peeled potat oes.  Served them.   Food I had  

enough already, I had en
ough food.  I wasn't 
hungry anymore
.  I use to knit  for the 
soldier's gloves.  They got it 
s om e how, wool.  I use t o k n it
 for them gloves.  I use to 
knit  for them socks.  I use 
to sew up certain things that
 they were ri
pped on them, 
you k now?  Of c o urs e,  I was un
der t h e pr otection wit h my
 father.  Otherwise, th ey 
would have raped me, 
they would have killed me, th
ey would have ne
ver taken me 
in.  They didn't need me.  
Bu t they needed my 
father.  Sometimes 
I use to even go, 
they t a ught me how t o us e a,
 not t he piec e of rif l e gun, 
but the long ones.  The . . .
 
Q: Rifle?
 
A: The r if l es.  T h ey taught
 m e how t o us e it in c as e
 somet h ing comes up.  They 
didn't wa nt me, but there wa
s other two Jewish girls ther
e.  One was older t h an I  
am and one was younger.  Al
so bec a us e of t heir  brot her s
.  They had br
others.  An d 
th is is a l l, t he r e wer e thr
ee childr e n, J e wis h k i ds.  Ther
e was no f em a les at all, t hey  
were not allowe d to 
have any female s there.  It 
wa s a regular army, organized 
army.
 
Q: And what was life like with the partis
ans?  Like, how many
 people we re there? 
Did you travel?  Was their fighting?
 
A: We traveled, they were 
f i ght ing.  T hey were not  s o
 many fighting, they were 
bombing us.  The G er m ans k new that t h e 
partisans ar e there bu
t it was t o wn a nd  

towns and miles with partisan, soldiers, 
ar mies,  t hat  t he Rus s ians left t h er e when 
they t o ok of f and t h ey r an.  And t h e G erm ans,  they wer e 
so bus y wit h t he Fr ont and 
with the fighting, it was a r
eal organized group, thousand
s of partisans, thousands. 
And t h ey use t o, my f at her knew mor e, un
f ort unat ely my fat h er 's  dead.  But  the y  
us e t o put bombs, when th
e Germans use to send, let's say ammunition to the 
Front, into deep Ru ss
ia, the par tisans knew about i
t.  And t h ey us e to put bom bs  
under the trains and stop them and just 
explode them.  They 
shouldn't be able to 
tak e it  t o t h e Fr ont,  t h e am
m unit i on and t he s o ldiers . 
 They killed thousands and 
thousands  of t h em,  thous ands of  Ger m ans .  
 They never made it
 into deep Ru ssia 
bec aus e t h e part is ans  really, s o
 they tried to bomb us out. 
 They tried, 
they kept on 
constantly bombing.  
And in one of these bombings we 
ran and I lo st my father.  I 
lost my father.  I was one who always wa
s  running in the fr ont for s om e reas on.  
And my father, he wa
s only thirty-six years old so he
 still was a young man, but for 
some reason, I was younger of co
urse, and I lo st him.  I lo
st him and I couldn't find 
him.  And we pas s ed by a r iv e
r.  We pass ed by a r iv er, I 
was like in th
e front.  The 
part is ans, what t h ey did, in or der for th
e ot her to cr os s the r iv er,  because it  was 
really burning and bombin g 
heavily, they put li
ke ropes.  Some partis ans swam 
through and they 
put a rope and two ropes
 on t h is s i de and t h is
 is how y o u pass t h e 
river.  A f e w of them 
passed, it was, of cour
se, I think it must ha
ve been a very, ver y 
hard thing to do,  and having partisans with 
ammunition.  I got hold
 of this thing and I 
started to walk over, they 
grabbed me and they wanted to
 pull me back.  I didn't let 
myself and I knew my father
 was like a few f e et in t h e 
back of me someplace and I 
started to pass by and th
e bombin g got closer and cl
oser and they
 dropped the 
ropes and I fell into t
he river.  But I was alr
eady not in  the middle 
of the deep river, I 
was like closer on the way out. 
 And they saw me fa
lling into the river. 
 I fell into the 
river.  Ther e' s some Russian
 soldiers, the Chin
ese I guess from, they called them in 
those years, I remember, Ta-tongs (ph), I don
't know how you call
 them now.  They 
schlepped me out, they pulle
d me out.  And of course
 I had nothing with me, 
whatever I had, clothing on
, but they pulled me
 out and I was tryi
ng myself  to be 
close to them.  I saw that they took  off, 
I don't have my father
, I'm either 14 or 15 
year s of age, s k inny like a toot hpic k, y o u k now
?  That ' s it, t h is is the end of me.  
And my father didn't want to
 leav e.  He k new t hat I am
 in t h e wat er s om ep l a ce, s o  
he said, "I'm not going."  
They said, "Well,  you're 
daughter's dead.
  I saw her 
falling."  Which is true, they
 saw me falling in, he said, "F
orget about it."  I have a 
blouse from thi
s incident, a
nd he said, "No, y o u'r e daugh
ter's not alive.  You're 
daughter fall into the 
water and who's going to
 save her?  Who's 
going to take care 
of her ?  She fell int o t he 
water.  She got drowned.  Sh
e's dead."  But I didn't.  I, 
these two Ta-tong (ph) from 
deep Russia, they really  took 
care of me.  
They really 
took care of me.  I was luck
y.  They, I gave th
em haircuts.  I also
 was working with 
the partisans with the mach ine, they had a ma
chine and shaving,
 so they needed 
me in a way.  And they
 really took care of me.  They really took care of me.  If they 

were st ealing some f o od, bec a
us e the part is ans, t he gr oup 
fell apart.  The majority 
group was left behind.  I wa
s with just about a doze
n people, maybe two dozen 
people.  Nobody wanted to take
 care of me, 
to give me a piece of
 bread, nothing.  
But these two partic ular people,
 t hey j u st f e lt  s orry  f or m e.  W h atev er t h ey  got  they 
shared with me.  An d one ni
ght  we were lay i ng ther e in
 the bushes, it was cold 
already, it was close 
to winter.  All of a 
sudden somebody 
stretching like that, I said, 
Oy-vey, what am I going to do
 now?  It's going to, and he's
 sort of laying completely  
like, freezing.  They took 
off their jacket s, he covered me.  He covered me with 
whatever he had, his jacket. 
 There's some good people in
 this world, there really 
are good people.  And then 
I walk ed with t h em, I held on t o them  and they were  
watching me.  Until 
the other group of the partis
ans, the bombing stopped and we 
got reunited.  But my father couldn't fi
nd me, he really  couldn't find me.  Do you 
want to hear the story, 
how he found me again?  And 
we walk ed and we  walked 
and t her e was a, you walk dayt ime, nigh
tt ime and y o u st ay hidden, and t hese t w o 
people shared with me th
ey're piece of
 bread.  There 
wa s not really a partis an here. 
The real partisans were left 
behind.  And we came to a 
town and I  was  wit h  them  
and t here was a doct or, not a doct or, it 
was a felc her (ph), a 
doctor.  And people 
started to get sick on typhus,  stomach typhus.  I wa s the on
ly girl.  I wouldn't say a 
woman, I wasn't a woman, th
e only girl.  And this doctor
 said to me
, he said, "You 
know what?  I'm going 
to show you how to ta
ke care a little bi
t of sick people." 
People st ar ted to get s ic k on t h e typhus, 
t h ey  were j ust dy in
g under you're hands, 
under you're feet. 
 He said, "This town is
 fr om part is ans ,  it 's a part isan t o wn.  Let' s 
see what. "  And s om e
 ot her part is ans c am e and I wa
s with this doctor and he wa s 
telling me how to put a b
andage on, how to gi
ve him, there wa
s no medications, 
there' s s o me t e a.  And we
 weren't, and the 
bom b ing s t art e d again.  T h is  was  
already a few weeks later.  
And the bombing started again.
  And a bomb, I wa s with 
the typhus people, I got sick
 on typhus.  I got sick on
 typhus and th
e temperature 
was running high an
d then when the, and they we
re la ying on bridges kind of, 
soldiers.  Some 
dead, some aliv e, some
 dead, some alive.  An
d I put myself at the 
ver y, v ery end.  T h ey  wer e not allowed to
 t o uc h me r eally be
cause it was against 
the law.  So I wa s, and 
then there we re so many 
young, beautifu
l women, young 
women, in the towns that, 
y o u know, look at  me?  T h
er e' s no woman, t here was  
nothing.  There was a skin and
 bone little girl.  And they
 wer e not allo wed.  So I  
slept like against the wall most
 of the time but wi
t
h the r est of t h e peop le, t h ey were  
sick on typhus.  And I got i
t, I got it.  And I started to
, I rem ember on c e they ev en 
br ought, t h ey  f lew down fr om Mos c ow, 
packages of m
edications.  They had 
connections with Moscow.  
And lay i ng ther e and they 
put out all the sick people ,  
outside.  Bombing started again.  And th
ey schlepped, we schlepped all the sic k  
people out, they put them out
side in barns, some
 dead, some alive.
  I was crawling 
a li ttle bit and this house wa
s burnin g and I got out of t
he house and I wa
s laying in 
the back of  the hous e.   And t he hous e is alr eady on f i
r e and I was lay ing t here t o  

die.  All of a sudden, my father
's here.  It's just
 like a miracle, a real miracle.  Ho w 
did you get here?  When they 
were walking from the other 
s i de of t h e river  and then  
they  cr os s e d t h e r i v er and then t h ey  c a
m e, t he bombing st opped,  and th en whe n  
the bombing started again and the town wa
s burnin g, he kept 
on yelling, "I had a 
daughter someplace, I 
had a daughter so
meplace.  Maybe you sa
w a little girl?" 
And t h ey k ept on telling him, m a ybe s h e' s 
her e, maybe she' s ther e, may be it 's i n  
this  house.  And until 
he came where I was la
ying under this  buildi
ng.  But I couldn't 
walk.  I was like dead,
 half -dead.  He schlepped me, 
he put me on his back.  This 
was j u st befor e t he liber at ion I gues s, t h is 
must have been like 
six mont hs before 
the liberat ion.  And we ha
d bom b ing and bombin
g and the part is ans m or e or  less  
had started to fall apa
rt.  But we  belonged to the group 
yet, and they wa
nted to kill 
me, the partisans.  He wa s 
schlepping me on his back and 
he said, "Well, if you 
drop her and any Germ
ans get her, she might talk  a 
little bit.  Maybe she knows 
anyt hing, I mean, she knows so
m et hing."  And t h ey j us t  want ed to kill m e.  And I  
heard that, I wasn'tunconscious.  Maybe so
metimes.  And he sa
id, "No, you will not 
kill my daughter.  If you want 
to kill her, f irst y
ou hav e to kill m e 
so I wouldn't know 
it.  Then you could kill my
 daughter."  And th
ey didn't.  And he
 schlepped me, he 
schlepped me on his back.  I was walk ing wi
th a big, not a cane,
 but a big stic k of 
wood, and aft er the liber at ion y e
t I was walking with that stic
k .  I couldn't walk.  And 
this is how he sav ed m y lif e
.  We were liberat
ed not far from So-y
ou-sk (ph).  When 
we got  t her e, t h ere was no gov er n ment at al
l yet.  They didn't 
have any go
vernment 
yet.  But there 
were no Jews ye
t.  There wa s, for about th
ree or four days, there 
was no gov er nment at all.  
It was like, the Germans took
 off and t he 
Russians came 
in and there was no government yet.  
And finally I guess 
t h e gov er nm ent go t  
or ganiz e d, the Russ ians, and t h ey.  I r em e
mber walking with th
is st ick, wit h my 
fat her ' s help of c our s e,  and t h ere was t e le
phone poles and on ev
ery  pole t here was  
hanging a German with his head
 down.  On every pole.  I 
don't know if  I should tell 
this  or not.  On every pol
e.  The partis ans 
cut some Germans 
or some peasants 
that were involved, who wa
s a policeman and he killed 
Jews or he was a policeman 
and killed partis ans, who 
was a guy who was with the 
Germans, you know?  They 
caught him and they hung 
him up.  They were hanging
.  I remember when w e  
cam e  to Sloo-sk ( p h) t hat wa
s the fir
st day I think, but we just  walked in there an d 
they had c a ught s ome Germ ans, t he part is
ans I guess, Germans,
 Poles, t h e ot her s  
who were involved in the 
German government, and they 
threw them all, certain 
things I remember we
ll, certain things I 
don't, I just don't re
m e mber, but  t h is I 
remember.  They pu
t them like in one, bi
g mountain of people, living people, aliv e. 
They were crawling on each 
other like worms. 
 Some wo unded, so
me healthy.  And 
the partisans said to 
my father, they said to him, "Y
ou know what ?  You hav e t his  
rifle.  Why don't you hit them
?  Hit them in there.  Give
 them for you'
re wife, for 
you're son.  Give it
 to them."  My fat
her gave one hit and he 
passed out.  He can't 
do it.  So they said, "Come 
on, how about you?  You're a 
young girl."  
I must have 

been c l os e to 16.  "F or  you're f at h er, f or 
y o u'r e mother.  You we
r e t here.  You sa w 
them doing that to you."  I couldn't, I wa s lik
e num b.  I look ed at t his .  I got s ic k  to 
my st omac h, I st art ed to thr o w up.  I coul
dn't hit one German.  I just couldn't.  And 
then my father got to 
his feet, he passed ou
t.  He gave one hit 
and he couldn't do it. 
These are Jews.  Jews are 
not fighters.  Thank God now
, t heir F at her s in Is rael ,  
thank G o d.   But those year s we
re just, I couldn't.  What 
they did t o me, what I saw 
with my own eyes.  This is 
j ust  a fr act i on of m y st or
y, what I saw when it was 
burning.  I got caught once, I ran, I wa lked
 out of the ghetto a
nd I was going to my 
house.  I got out, I j ust s
neaked out.  An d I asked for so
me food.  On
 the way back 
they didn't give me.  On 
the way back, I passed by a 
garden and I 
was, maybe I 
took out a few scallions ther
e, I don't know.  
They caught 
me.  They beat the Hell 
out of me.  They threw me 
back into the ghetto, they 
could have kille
d me on the 
spot.  T hey  thr e w me back int o t he ghett o 
wit h a s w ollen f a ce, 
beat up.  Not the 
Germans beat me up, the Po le
s.  An d here I couldn't hi
t one German.  I couldn't. 
My father couldn'
t, he gave one hit and 
he passed out.  There 
is  Jewish people for 
you.
 
Q: Let's talk a little 
bit about how you got 
to the DP camps and what they were like?
 
A: Well we were libe
rated in Swoot-ska
 (ph) and my father 
was always a Yiddishist 
and he s a id, "W ell let 's go t o 
my home town."  He met a 
woman in Slot-s
kol- sa (ph)  
and we knew that my moth
er's dead, and we 
went  to my hom et
own and t hen he 
went  t o a bigger  town in Pi
ns ke (ph) to look for some more Jews.  Pins ke (ph) , in 
Pinske (ph) a few people surv
iv ed, not too many people. 
 And another 
town by the 
name of W o- nin- y etz ( ph) and t hey wer e 
talking, there was t
he hagga-nah (ph) and 
there was the Br ig-ha (ph) 
sneaking and looking and tryi
ng to organize Jewis h  
sur v iv or s.  My f at her , I  r
eally  don't know how he foun
d out about it, 
he found out 
about it  and he go
t in touch with some 
people and he said, "You
 know what?  There 
is a way, t h ey ar e going t o 
tak e us to I sr ael f r om her e.
  There is the Bra-han (ph), 
the Haga- n an ( ph),  ot her I sraeli or ganizat i
ons .   And t h ey ar e going t o s om e how ge t  
us out of her e and we'r e going t o  go t o I s
rael.  My father had
 t w o s i sters and a 
br other in Am er ic a.  But he didn't r em e
m b er the addres s, he
 didn't remember 
nothing.  I mean, he lost ev
er ything t h at was left in the 
house before we went int o  
ghett o.  And ther e wa
s no way of getting in  touch.   But wit h the Hagga- na ( ph) ,  
Abra-ha (ph), I really don't k now whic h one it was, they 
organized t h e left ov er J e ws  
who ev er  sur v iv ed.  
And they were going 
to send us, we had 
to go I think to 
Bialystok, t o som e or ganizer.
  This was the main place w
her e they tried t o get som e  
Jewish names and Jewish people and he went
 there and he re
gistered kind of 
there and then he came back,
 t h is I rem e mber, and t hen
 we went, th
ey smuggled 
us, it was 1945 y et.  W e wer e liber at ed in 
1944, in Sou- ls ka ( ph)
, a year before the 
regular liberat ion.  And they
 smuggled us as Greek Jews
 t o Lodz .  We c am e t o  
Lodz, very well organized, 
they put us in a Kibbutz (
ph) being we were partisans 

and soldier s.  T h ey put us 
in a cam p by t h e nam e of 
Ba-hack (ph).  It was not a 
cam p r eally, it was m or e lik e a gr oup. 
 And we c ame there and were regis t er ed 
there, they br ought us there.  
I think they gave us papers . . .

Q: This is interview with Florence Eisen, t
ape 2.  Ok ay,  we wer e just t a lk ing abou t  
after liberation.
 
A: Yeah.  And fr om t here t h ey sm uggled us
 in, we're not allowe
d t o s peak any ot her 
language but Hebrew, I 
guess.  I was the on
ly one who knew a li
ttle  Hebrew, how t o  
speak Hebrew.  But by 
then already my fath
er remarried.  He 
got married in Swiss 
gov er nment, a J e wis h woman wit h a c h ild.  
More or less my age
, so we were the 
four of  us.
 
Q: Who was s h e?  How did 
he meet he
r and where?
 
A: He m et he r in Swo o
-sk (ph), he met her in
 Swoo- sk (ph) r i ght af ter t h e lib er at ion .  
Some J e ws st art e d to com e in fr om ev er
y part of Rus s i a.  
They came from, sh e 
was born and raised 
in Swoo-sk (ph) but 
in the war her hus
band got killed right 
away, I guess, they killed hi
m.  And they kind of, I don't 
know how they 
got to dee p  
Rus s ia.  But aft er t he war, it was  not af
t er t he war t he war wa
s still going on for a 
whole year, but in that area,
 in Swoo-s k ( p h) t he war wa
s over.  So 
she came with 
her daughter, also a son but
 the son was in the army, 
and my father
 was a young 
man, t h irty- six year s old, 
a lonely person with
 a child, and he me
t her.  She just  
cam e fr om,  I think she was 
around Moscow som
eplace, and he me
t her.  An d she 
was also a young woma
n, lonely.  And they got marri
ed there.  Sh e knew that my 
mother's dead, I mean, 
they knew my mother is dead. 
 And he m arr ied her.  So we 
were lik e f o ur of us.  She wasn't a go
od stepmot her .  She was a mean st epmot her  
to me, like in the books.  I 
had another war with 
her.  T h is wom an 
really didn't give 
me to eat, that's how mean 
she was to me.  Le
t her rest in  peace now.  And she, 
we tr av eled from Lodz thr o
ugh Cz echoslovakia, 
through Germany, 
into a displace d 
cam p not f ar fr om M unic h by t he name of
 Poke-ing (ph).  They
 brought us there, 
they gav e us c lot hes,  they s anit iz e d 
us, t h ey c leaned us up
.  We were clea n 
already more or less, 
more or less we were
 clean.  And they star
t to give us, it was 
an organized camp for mispla
ced people.  They gave us
 packages of food.  And 
they star ted to leave, m or e or less, they 
gav e us a r o om.  I t  was like a barrack s and  
like little rooms,
 so they  gave us  a sm
all room.   T h ey gav e us
 enough food.  An d, of 
cour se,  my  fat h er  alway s had a pr ofess i
on, he was a barber.  
So he started right 
away to wo rk in the camp 
as a barber.  We were free
 already, of co
urse, and we 

were there.  We came in
 1946 in January and we 
left and they closed this  
misplaced, the DP camp, th
ey became like in 
1948.  I got marrie
d there, met my 
husband there, got married th
er e, had a nic e wedding.  Bu
t then when Po -king (ph) 
got c l os ed, they send us t o anot her c am p
 by  the nam e of F e
ldaf ing wher e m y s on  
was bor n, my son was bo
r n t her e in F e ldaf ing.
 
Q: How many people were 
in t h e cam p ?  W e re t here m a ny ot her c h ildren?
 
A: It was a big camp, yeah.  
Whoever had survived.  I me
an, t h ey  get at us, they  
took us to a place in Me
chelen and Salt zheim (ph) 
and they _______
_ at us, I 
guess they sent other people 
to different camps too, but 
this wa s all organized from 
Israel.  Hagga-nah (p
h) , Abra-ha (ph), I'm not sure wh
ich group did it, but that was 
well, also from Hi-yas (ph)
 already, we were supported 
from the Hi-ya
s (ph) from 
the United St at es.   They f o
und us, my father 's two sist er s.  Unfortunately the 
br other j ust  died when we c am e, but the t w
o sisters they found 
out for us.  It was, 
the food and everything, th
e clothing and food wa s ma
inly t hr o ugh t he Had- das a  
(ph), Hi-yas (ph), excuse me, 
not Had-dasa (ph)
, Hi-yas (ph).
 
Q: And what did people do du
ring the day?  What did 
people occupy themselv es 
with?
 
A: What did people do?  We st
art to get organized, like I 
knew like a little He brew. 
Ther e was kit c hens.  T hat ther e wer e c oo
ks and brought in food
 and whoever didn' t  
have any food to eat, yo
u came there, you ate in 
the kitchen, in the __________ 
kit c hen.  O r  lik e we had 
like a family , my st epmot h er 
and m y fat h er, they gave us  
care packages and my 
stepmother cooked for us.  My 
f a ther is being a barber.  He 
started to work right away 
as a barber.  There were 
or ganized, t h ey  st art to 
organize like schools fo
r children.  I was li
ke a kindergarten so 
I was teaching, I was 
talking, I had to talk Hebr
ew to the kids and I knew
 som e Hebr ew s o I s p ok e 
Hebr ew to the c h ildr e n.  I 
hav e pict ur es,  I hav e a pic t
ur e fr om it .   And I gues s 
whoever was a tailo
r and whoever was 
a shoemaker, ever
ybody started to 
reorganize their lives a little 
bit, in that camp even.  We
 had, next door to us, we 
had a Club wit h mus ic and t h
e y o ung k ids us e to go danc
ing t her e, next door.  W e  
were liberated, we
 were free.  We were 
already free.  And this 
was, and we start to 
correspond with my father's two sisters.  
They send me package
s, clothing, food, 
money.  We had enough food. 
 And we were there from a
bout 1946 of January.  In 
March my husband came wit h 
his group and we me
t and we were co
urting for ov er 
thr ee y ear s .   And in
 1948 we got married.
 
Q: How did you m e et y ou'r e hus band?
 
A:  Yo u know, the Jews som
ehow they are, they know 
how to live and they are 
sur v ivor s.  So as soon as we got  t here it was a gr oup 
like actors and I 
wa nt e d t o  b e  

an actr ess.   So I went  over
 there and I said, well I coul
d dance, I could sing, take 
me in, this kind of st uff.  And they put 
up a show, ther e was li
ke 7,000 Jews maybe 
in that camp.  A 
show, _________ 
___________, an old, ol
d Jewish show.  And 
they gave me a part in the ot
h er,  int er v ie we d me, t h is gu
y and they gav e me a part  
in there.  So they put 
up like a _________ 
___________ and after 
the show, there 
was dancing.  So I was in the show.  I pl
ayed my part and aft er the show I was h e d  
my face, whatev
er the make-up was on
, and I went down and 
was danc ing.   And 
this  y o ung man c am e ov er t o
 me and asked me 
to dance.  I said 
okay.  And onc e  
or t w ic e, we wer e bot h v ery good danc er s
, and t h is is how we
 met.  And we ne v e r  
left each other again.  It was ju
st instant lo ve, in
stant love.  And th
at's how we met 
and we were going st eady
, and then when they clos
ed the camp, I got married 
there.  W e  went t o, they s e nt us to a 
camp, I wa s pregnant.  
They send us to a 
cam p by the nam e of Fohr enwal
d.  I was there, I gave bi
rt h t here.  Meant im e, the 
family of my father, the tw
o sisters, especially  one si
ster, was working we should 
come to Americ a.  She ju
st wanted us in Am eric a, 
it 's a good 
country and she 
want ed ev ery body.  She want ed her br
ot her, his wife and s t eps i ster, me, my  
hus band.  But my fat h er didn't t e ll them t hat 
I  got marr ied.  So they send us , at that  
it was aff i davit s, it was not contr act s yet, 
it was aff i dav its .  T h ey made up paper s  
and they were goi
ng t o take us fr om Po- k ing (ph)
 t o Am er ic a.  But meant im e I  got  
married and I put anothe
r name on the contract, on the,
 later on it  
was contracts, 
aff i dav its, whatever.  And t h en, all of a s u
dden, I got pregnant.  And they had to put 
som ebody els e on it, on the, s o any w ay
, when we moved to 
Fohr enwald t hey, m y  
stepsister, she says s
he doesn't want to go 
to Am er ica.   She does n't wan t  to go t o 
Am er ic a.  She got up and s h e went to I srael
.  She went to Isr
ael and m y father 's  
sister started, I shou
ldn't go to Israel.  
I should come to Am eric
a.  They didn't hav e  
any children.  They wa
nted me as a child, t
hey will do for me, they
'll give me, they'll 
give my husband a good job.
  He had no prof
ession, he was 21
 years old when he 
marr ied m e , he had no pr of es s i on.  We had 
no skills.  I was alr
eady with a baby. 
We took some lessons in camp
, in English, how much do 
we know English?  Ye s or 
no, m ay b e thank you, that' s 
about the whole thin g.  Bu
t  my st epm o ther, be ing her  
daughter, at that time it wa
sn't legal to go yet, being 
that the daughte
r's already in 
Israel, she wants to go to Is
rael too.  So  she schlepped 
my father to Israel.  This 
was in  1948, must 
have been the end of 
1948 because I got ma
rried the end of 
August, and a month late
r the
y  left to Israel.  So he 
saw what was go
ing on t h er e,  
bad.  Mo-mish (ph) people 
were starving a
nd the wars and he 
kept on writ ing 
letters, please my kin (ph) 
don't come here
.  I know you don't 
want to be without 
me, all those years, but now it â„¢s
 a diff erent world, it â„¢s  a fr
ee wor l d.  You'r e going t o  
see, I never wa nted to
 leave my father fo
r one day.  It's _______
__ in the partis ans, 
there were a f e w c h ildr en a
nd wh en the plane came, they 
want ed to take them to 
Moscow.  I said, I'm no
t going.  Either I'll 
live with my father or
 I'm going to die wit h 
my father.  They left, they we
nt to Moscow by plane, they
 took them.  I didn't want  

to go.  I said, no
 way am I going without 
my father.  Whatever it
 will be it 
will happe n  
to t he t w o of us.  I 'm not leav ing m y fat h er. 
 So he said t o  me, "I
t's not the partisans, 
it 's not t he war.  The war is ov
er.   Go t o my sist er 's.  You'
ll have a good 
life.  You'll 
come here with 
a husband who has no sk
ills, who does not 
know a word of
 English. 
Believe me, we ar e st arv i ng.  T h er e' s no 
apartments.  You can'
t get an apartment. 
He does n â„¢t hav e a pr of es s ion.  I hav e a pr
of ess i on.  I c ould work as  a bar ber , bu t  
you're husband 
doesn't have a profession
.   He has nothing."  
Anyway, I let him, he 
said, "If you're co
m i ng ov er I 'm  going t o c om m it s u ic
ide.   And then 
you're not going 
to have a father all 
together.  Go to Am erica."  A
nd that's wh at happened.  They 
send, but then al
ready the contract s came in.  They
 s end t h e aff i dav its and they  
made affidavits for me, for my husband and fo
r my son.  Then t h
ey had to r e- do it 
bec aus e by  the t im e t h e aff i dav its  cam e 
my son wa s born and 
they had to change 
everything around again, yo
u know?  And I said, well, le
t' s go t o Am er ic a.  My  
husband had a fam
ily there, they didn't 
want him to go to Am
er ic a e ither.   Bec aus e 
they wer e going to go to Is
rael.  My mot h er- i n- law had t w
o s ist er s in Isr ael.  So we 
were kind of wr itten aside, I 
won the case.  And we went  
to America.  It just turned 
out that I took my husband's w
hole family to Americ a.  A 
year later his br ot her c am e 
with his wife and a dau
ght er.  And a y e ar lat er, two- an
d-a- half y e ar s lat er, we took  
ov er his m ot her, she still stay ed in F ohrenw
ald and his  marr ied s i
ster with her two 
children and a husband.  So I wo n the case.  I took them al
l to Am eric a.  Thin k that 
I'm no sorry, it 's a beautif
ul country, we've had a good life
 here.  My husband works 
hard.  An d then my father, af
ter quite a few years, her d
aughter went to Montreal. 
She got married in Is
rael and her da
ught er went  to Montr eal
 and I couldn't bein g 
him here yet.  So she 
took him to Montreal
.  Unfortunately he 
died when he was to o 
young, he died of c
ancer, he was fifty-six years old. 
 But the time ca
me that I could 
have enjoyed my fa
ther and be with him 
and give him a little 
na-has (ph)
, he died.
 
Q: Before we talk 
about life in Americ a,
 just  again, the cam p s.  How much was it ,  
lik e, did it f eel at all lik e a 
sor t  of like a real lif e?  You 
s aid ther e wer e c l as ses, t here 
were schools, there we re dance
s, there were plays.  How 
was it like a, how do you 
kind of build back a lif e?
 
A: To me I knew it 's not 
a real life yet, bu
t it was good.  It 
was heaven.  I had 
enough food.  I had friends.  Now I remember 
my friends ,  and the 
r e st of t he fr iends 
I jus t  block out, I r em e mber not
hing.  But in camp, 
in Po-king (ph) it
 was a good life 
for us.  It was, but we
 weren't, if  we had fr
om 1939 until 1946 already it  wa s, it was 
already after the war, it  wa
s heaven.  They gave us th
e hi-y as  (ph) and ther e' s 
enough packages, 
enough food.  It was 
kitchens, whoever 
couldn't cook for 
themselves they took care of 
us, they give us clothing.  
It  was a lif e.  What we had 
in the war, this was a good 
life.  Some people fr
om, survivors, they went to tow n s, 
they went t o bus i ness  ev en 
t h ere,  they  got  m arr ied t her
e.  I mean, lik
e in Minute-
hen (ph), Deblin, 
and those big cities, so
me of them  got re-est
ablished there too but 

my fat h er was a, had a job 
and this was his pr of es sion 
and we went to this cam p  
and we  had it  pretty 
good.  But we k
new that sooner or later 
we would have to go. 
This is not  a place to finish, to make a life, 
t h e r est  of our liv es.  
It was, mainly it was 
Israel.  Mainly our aim was to go to Israel
.  But being of his two 
s i st ers  an d alarming 
and coming and being, he wa
s there befor e me and lif e
 was tough and lif e  was  
hard and lif e was  r eally ha
rd, you know?  So 
we said good-bye 
and life in camp 
wasn't a ________ ________ camp.  Ev
erybody had enough
 food to eat.
 
Q: What did people talk
 about in 
the camps?
 
A: It depends.  We ca
me out like from cage
s.  That's all we w
anted to do, is  have a 
good time.  We went to work, we came ba
ck from work.  I was wo
rk ing as a, fir st I  
was working as a Hebrew teac
her, no, first I wa
s work ing in a plac e wher e t h ey us e 
to make, it â„¢s a fact ory you ca
ll it.  They us e to make li
tt le s weat er s  and glov es for  
Am eric an, this was done throug
h the Hi-y as  ( ph). 
 So I k n itt ed, bei
ng I knew how to 
knit, I knitted the litt
le sc arv e s, s w eat er s, lit t l e boots
, glov es , and t h is  wa s s e nt to  
Am er ic a.  Wher e it was, I t h
ink t o Texas someplace, I d
on't know.  So, for this we 
work ed and ev ery week we got a c ar e pac k
age for that.  No mo
ney.  Just a car e  
pack age of  food we got .
 
Q: So we were just talk
ing about work ing and t he 
daily life in the camp?
 
A: Yes, and the daily lif e, we
 as childr en, we had s om e 
friends.  Once or twic e a 
week we went dancing
.  We belonged to th
is kibbutz (ph), Ba-
hach (ph), wh ic h it  
was f or left ov er part is ans and s o ldier s.  As
 a m att er of  fact, t hey send us, be in g I  
knew a little  Hebrew, they send a group of
 us  t o a diff er ent cam p, Ba- dr ac k-en- hive 
(ph) to organize.  It was also 
a DP, there for misplaced peopl
e.  They send us to re-
or ganiz e Ba- hac h (ph) , to open
 up a new kibbutz (ph) and th
at's what we did.  As a 
matter of fact with some of
 the people I am still friendly 
up until now.  
Lovely people, 
intelligent people.  We were 
there for almost a 
year.  And then th
at group, the y  
send him to Israel and I didn
't want to go and they wou
nded up in the Cypr ess,  an d 
I went back home to my fath
er, in Po-king (ph).  It was,
 for a DP camp it was a 
pretty good life wh at we went 
through.  Food, we
 had.  Clothing, we
 had.  We went 
danc ing.  T he Ha-y as s  (ph) t o
ok  c ar e of us.   I  had f am i ly
 in Am er ic a,  they  s e nd  m e  
packages.  But our aim wa
s to go to Israel.  This was our  
aim, is to go to Israel.  But 
being for my fat h er' s t w o s i
st er s, they were y e lling an
d s cream ing, we s hould com e  
here.
 
Q: And y ou wer e s ay i ng bef or e t h at in 
the camps, people mo
stly talked about?
 
A: They talked about 
the past.  They 
were still looking if an
ybody surviv ed.  They 
were still looking if 
anybody, someplace surv
ived.  So they
 use to go 
to different  
misplaced camps and look around
 there.  They were lookin
g, they were lookin g for 

family.  There wa s 
one from here, 
one from ten people, one
 from seven people, 
mostly from concentration ca
m p s.  Most of  them.   W it h
 the numbers.  And what 
could they t a lk ?  What we went thr ough, and
 now what are we go
ing to do now with 
our future?  What we going 
to do now?  And broken up
 families.  If there was a 
family.  My father made 
a f am ily  bec a us e he m arr i
ed that woman and she had a 
child, and me, we were
 like a family.  But 
most it was like on
e person, one person, 
one person.  Br other 
and sister?  Not too many.  
Unless people wh
o came from 
Russia, who had a fe
w families where they came fr
om deep Russia a
nd they were 
like a few families t
ogether.  But most of them, they
 were lonely, lo nely people who 
tried to f i nd a mat e and ge
t m arr ied and hav e a, t o 
be wit h s om ebo
dy, not to be 
lonely.  Ev en some men who didn't know 
if t he wif e sur viv ed and t hey got married 
and t hen t h e wif e c am e, fr om someplace, 
who knows where?  Th
er e was tr ouble in 
this area.  But we  
were two young kids wi th my fa
ther, my stepmo
ther and we had 
like a little  home, you know
?  In one room.   And t hen 
we went danci
ng, we were 
laughing, we we re playing card
s, it  was a pretty normal 
life in  this DP camp, yes.
 
Q: Did people have much info
rmation about what had happe
ned to their families or 
their neighbors or their town s?
 
A: They did and they didn't.  It still was 
unbelievable that
 something like this could 
have happened.  I went home
, I knew wh at happe
ned to my mother
 and my sister 
and my brother.  I knew it 
bec aus e t he peas a nts t o ld us. 
 They we re watching.  And 
from this side of the ghetto
 nobody surviv ed, n
obody.  From the ot
her side where it  
was t he uprising, lik e me, 
survives.  And some ot her 
people survived.  500 people 
run out of t hat ar ea.  But 
s ur viv e?  M ay b e 125.  Som e
 of them got st arv ed from  
hunger, some of them got kill
ed, some of them go
t killed in the part
is ans.  Some of 
them got lost.  Some of them
 remained in Ru ssia
.  But the majority
 of people of my 
homet o wn went  to I s
rael.  The majority.
 
Q: So let's talk abou
t c om ing t o Amer ic a.
 
A: So this was my life in Germ any.  Go
t m a rried t her e and t hen r i ght away I go t  
pregnant and I had a li
ttle boy, whic h was like a miracle 
happened.  I jus
t, a miracle. 
I couldn't belie ve it.  As a ma
tter of fact, when 
I got pr egnant I was only 20.  I was  
20 when I got m arr ied.  And I 
went  to t h is doct or, t he G er m an doctor ,  and he s a id t o  
me, "You are pregnant."  I sa
id, "Well,  yeah I'm marrie
d and now I'm pregnant." 
And he said, "You shouldn'
t have gotten pregnant, you're 
not even developed yet. 
You're not a woman, 
you're a child."  
I didn't even have, ex
cuse me, my period 
normal y et.   I was 19 and I st
ill wasn't normal.  So he 
said, "You'll never have this 
child.  I don't know what's 
going to happen to 
you but  you s houldn't h av e gott en 
pr egnant."  I had a t o ugh t i
m e, I  really had a 
tough time.  In th
is country I would 
hav e had a c es ar e an, but t hen they s c hl
epped t h em out, they
 ripped 
me apart, 
ripped me in pieces. 
 He was born in a ca
mp by t h e name of 
Fohrenwald and I was 

four days in labor.  This do
ct or was r i ght, I  wasn't develo
ped,  I j us t  didn't gr ow as  a  
woman.  I was still, I 
was undernourished
.  I ' ll giv e y o u, food 
was good but it wasn't 
such a v it a mins and s uc h, good f ood.  Ev
en in the DP camp, 
like we had the can s  
of Spam, c ans of, it was n 't t he r i ght f ood 
f or a c h ild to eat and t h e r i ght  v it am in food ,  
you know?  But t h en, of c our
se, we got the pape
rs and we immigrated to Am erica, 
the thr e e of  us.  Me and my 
hus b and and m y s on.
  As a matt er of fact, m y Uncle,  
they paid up that we 
shouldn't go by boat so he paid up 
to fly in here.  We should fly 
to Am er ica.   W h en we got he
re t h e Ha-yass (ph)
 gav e us back  t he money.  And we 
stay ed, we cam e the thr ee of us , without 
la nguage, without real
 c l ot hing, withou t  
knowledge of anything.  I 
mean, just young.  
Very young.  My 
husband was 21 and 
I was 20-something, not even 
21 when I gave bi
rth t o him.  And we stay ed wit h m y  
Uncle and my Au nt, they we
re pretty good to 
us.  It wa s my 
father's sister.
 
Q: Wher e was t h is ?
 
A: It was in the Bronx
, East Bronx, Fran
klin Avenue.  But to me
 it was heaven.   As  
meager  ev eryt hing was 
and we  lived with them
 and to me it was,
 I was free.  But I 
had a problem sleeping.  I 
heard the plane and I was 
flying but when I heard a 
plane I was flying ou
t the window.  This  wa s going on 
for years, for years.  And I 
tried not to think and I, wh
atev er,  for som e r eas on th
e bombing made such a big 
impact on me, left 
me with such a, I was te
rrif ied for planes
, terrified.  I 
didn't fly for 
many, many years.  Though I fl
ew in here.  But 
I was like, I had lik
e anxiety, when I 
hear d t h e plane f l y I  had an 
anxiet y attack.   And I was f l
ying through the window.  I 
was cold, I was relaxed, when
 we started to go
 to the _________ co
lonies.  When I 
was in the woods and I could ru
n, it 's like, always I could 
hide and run in the wo ods. 
I was not safe in a buildin g.  
I  was  afr a id of buildings.  I 
was afraid of planes, of the 
bombing.  Bec a us e t h ey  tr ie
d to bomb us out a lot, a 
lot.  And this 
was my, I got 
anxiety att acks.  I almost
 got k illed if my hus band 
wouldn't have 
grabbed me, I 
would be out the window, flying
 out the window.  The only
 time I felt good, I felt 
rela xed, when I was in the country,
 in  the __________
, in the _________ 
__________, I was in  the woods
 and I saw the trees and 
I knew I could run.  I 
mean, it was still in my mind
, of running.  I'm going t o 
r un,  I'm  going t o r u n, I 'm 
going t o r u n.  Though I was s a
fe but I wasn't sa
fe psychologically.  
I just couldn't, I 
couldn't, it was still in my 
m i nd, I ' m going t o run.  T h at
's it .  For ma
ny, many, many 
year s.  M any years.
 
Q: What did you and you're 
husband do when y o u f ir st  
got here?  Work?  Did yo u 
find an apartment?
 
A: Well we  got here.  
My family  picked us up.
  W e st ay ed wit h 
them.  It was very 
hard in  1949, it was very 
hard to get an apartment. 
 It was im pos s ible t o get an 
apartment.  So we lived wi
th my Uncle and Aunt, they 
took us in.  They had a 
priv ate house on Franklin
 Avenue.  We live 
with them.  They ga
ve us food
.  They 

gave us a little spending mone
y.  And then we 
knew there was a ha-
yass (ph).  My 
husband use to go, I had a 
baby already, and he star
t to go to school, learn the 
language, went to 
ha-yass (ph), got some 
informatio n.  They tr
ied to give him a job 
but he had no skills.  
So he was, I had a cousin 
who was a painter, he painted  
apartm ents .  He gave him a j
ob as a paint er.   But bef or e 
that he was a carpenter. 
He didn't k now how t o  keep 
a hammer in his  hand, he was 
a car p enter.  T hen they  
put him, he got a j o b, it 
was  M o is her' s ( p h) Superm ar k e
t.  He got  a j o b t h er e in 
Mois her's (ph) Supermarket, he
 us e t o put t he c ans on the shelves.  And th en m y  
cous in t o ok  him in as a, t o
 teach him how to paint, paint
 apartm ent s.  He was ver y  
good at that, once he le
arned how to paint, and he le
ar ned and he paint ed and he 
made s om e m o ney.  We st ay ed wit h m y 
f a mily  f or s i x  mont hs, wit h m y Aunt  and  
Unc l e.  And t hen t h ey  got  
us an apartment, also not 
far from Franklin Avenue, I 
remember the address
, 638 Catona Pa
r k Sout h, Eas t  Br onx
.  They got us a n  
apartm ent.  My family paid $600. 00 under  
the t able t o get m e 
this apartment.  But 
they were very nice, they were not poor
 people, and they go
t us this apartment, 
came with some furnit ur e.  And my Uncl
e bought m e a br and new bedr oom s et, I ' ll  
never forget, if I would have 
that s et now it ' s an antique.   
I could have m ade a lot of  
money.  So I, beaut if u l two- bedr oom apar
tment, it was on the second floor, two 
bedr ooms.   But t h e r ent was  
expensive, $42.50 a mo
nt h.  So what di
d I do?  A lot of 
_________ came in there and 
there's one single guy who 
I knew him from Po-king 
(ph).  I rent ed t o him as a bo
arder.  So he lived, I rent
ed the apartment to him an d 
he gav e m e lik e, $25. 00 or $3
0. 00 a m o nth, so t h at was  a big help wit h pay i ng rent . 
And then a year late
r,  to m e it was  heav e n on ear th
.  If I could 
go to _______ _  
Av enue shopping, buy food, I di
dn't have to buy 
expens iv e f o od, in thos e y e ars  we 
didn't know about cholesterol, but if I co
uld mak e them a c h ic ken, three m eals,  
whic h I did, I was alwa ys a big with 
bala-boosta (ph).  I 
learned from my 
stepmother, she was a _______
__ bala-boosta (ph).  From 
my Au nts.  And I didn't 
know how to cook, but I le arne
d.  I wanted to learn.  I wanted to take care of my 
family.  And I lo ved every minut
e of it, from the day I came 
to this countr
y.   Because 
I was free.  I was free, exce
pt when I was on the plane f li
ght, I was free.  And I had 
food, I had enough food.  I had
 my own refrigerator of 
food.  I opened up and I 
bought bread and milk and I baked cakes an
d I went out with my
 kid to the park 
and, I was afr a id to go.  I 
was looking wit h kind of  a, 
I was always su
spicious, but 
you get us e to it.  And then 
a year later, we brought hi
s brother and his wife and a 
child here.  And he wo
rked, being my husba
nd wor ked a litt
le bi
t by Moisher's (ph) 
Supermarket and my br
other-in-law who wo rk
ed in Germany, he 
was in a different 
cam p  in G erm any, also with t h is kind
 of a supermarket go
ods, and they were 
think i ng of going int o bus i ne
ss.  No pr of es s i on, what 
do you do?  Yo u go into 
bus i ness.  So they st art, t hey
 look ed int o it and t hey  
bought like a small, little 
gr oc ery.  M oney we didn't hav e.  And m y
 Uncle said to me, 
"Hum ph, I gave you 
everything.  I'll give yo
u a business?  What does 
you're husband know about 

bus i ness ?  Was he ev er . . .[ En
d of s i de 1 of  Tape 2]. . .  
but t o giv e  us m o ney ?   To 
go into business.  He said, "You're not, yo
u'r e  st ill gr een horns.
  You have to bring  
your self  up first  bef or e  yo
u go into business
."  Anyway, we borrowed here a few 
dollar s, t her e a few dollars, 
and he worked.  Those years 
he made nice money as a 
painter.  And we saved up.  He didn't 
even know, I saved up 
$1,500.00.  And then 
when he went t o bus i ness , wher e ar e we 
going to get  the m o ney ?
  I took out th e 
$1,500.00, I said, " H er e' s $1, 5 00. 00."  
He s a id, "W hat ?  Wher e did you get  the 
money ?"  I saved it up.
  And his br ot her br ought a set 
of Rosenthal (ph) dishes from 
Germany, he sold that.  An
d they bought like a small, 
litt le groc ery.   And t h e y  
cheated us from t o p t o bottom,
 from top to bottom.  We co
uldn't make a living out of 
it.  Not two families. 
 I remember they
 started to take out, li
ke $30.00 a week, and 
some food when they could.   By then already I had a 
beautiful apartm
ent, they had 
an apartment.  The ha-y
ass (ph) helped with apartmen
ts, a lot of people, a lot.  I 
was lucky t hat I had my Uncle, my Aunt,  
my f ather 's  s ist er s 
helped us.  But the 
other newcomers, _______
 t hey us e t o c a ll thos e y e ar
s, the ha-y as s ( ph) helped.  
Help with money, paid for ren
t, gave money for fo
od, for a while.  Until you got jobs. 
They tried to give y ou jobs , they got you 
jobs.  An d lu ckily, as
 I said before, my 
family  wa s very helpful.  
They gave me kosher dish
es, they gave me ________, 
they gave milk, they 
gave ________, I 
was kosher in those year s, very kosher.  And 
this is how we bought this 
little store and they chea
ted us.  They were _________ _ 
green, they were
 green.  But they ne
ver gave up.  They di
dn't give up, and the n  
there was, they st art e d t o 
build  a huge, big building on 
the concourse.  The stor e 
was lik e off  the c o nc ours e and they st art e
d t o build like a big 
building with a hug e  
supermarket on th
e bottom.  Well, they got panicky.
  If t h is huge s u permar k et goe s  
in, we are completely
 out.  At least, legally we 
push through days
 and months 
think i ng what to do for  the 
future, but now with this su
permar ket coming up, forg e t  
it.  So they looked at ea
ch other, the two brothers, and they sa id to themselves, 
how do we get t h is  s uperm ark et ?  We c oul
d buy it.  But we do
n't have any money. 
What ar e we going to do f or money ?  Ther
e' s no m o ney.  My  
Uncle says he's not  
giving me any money be
cause you're going to
 lose it, he said, they cheated you out 
of this litt le stor e and now their going t o c h eat
 you again.  He wouldn
't giv e it to us .  
Here I have already 
another child was born
, my daughter wa s born
 in 1952.  Wha t  
are we going to do?  We st
arted to talk to Green-na 
(ph) and Green-na (ph) are 
really helpful, you know?  And they lended us money,
 they got $2
,000.00 here, 
$1,000.00 there.  Mayb
e we
 got something for 
this litt le st or e her e, I don't know ho w 
much.  My husband ma
ybe knows more about it.  An d 
believe it or not, we bought 
this Supermarket.  They went
 to the people that
 put in the electr
ic supply and they 
went to the people that ga
ve us the food, you know
?  Am I correct, Heshew?
 
Heshew: About what?
 

A: How we got into the supermarket, to th
e big s uperm ark et ?  It was t h e f irst air  
conditioned supermarket in
 the Br onx.  I thin
k in Ne w York, maybe.
 
Heshew: Yeah.
 
A:  The first air conditioned su
per m ark et.   W e hav e  pict ur
es.   T her e was  a line when 
we opened up, there wa
s a line around the co
rner coming into th
e store to buy. 
And we  worked hard, 
I mean, they worked 
hard.   They worked 
very, very hard. 
They still took out very
 litt le money ,  and t o pay up a
ll the debt s, t hat
 we owe peop l e  
money.  And the busin ess, I 
was in seventh heav
en.  I have enoug
h food.  I could 
give my kids food, f
ood, food, food.  
Until now, my gut obsession
 is food.  Just to 
have enough food 
for my children and for 
my grandchildren.  
They are alwa ys right 
about m e.  Why is  my  Babba 
so obsessed with food?  So
 I explained it  to them, 
how m any year s I was  
hungry.  That I ha
d raw beets and raw 
potatoes, and now I 
hav e food and I don't want m y k i ds t o ge
t hungry.  We're not 
going to be hungry, 
don't pus h  on us.   And t h ank G o d t h e 
store was good.  An
d we  saved and we 
saved.  W e lived ver y, how 
you say it ?  W it h in splash, 
with lots of money.  An d 
________ they had and they worked 
very hard.  In those 
years the su
permarket s  
were open seven days a week
.  And later 
hours.  He hardly saw 
the children.  By 
the time he came home 
the kids were already in bed, 
lik e 7 or 8 o' c l oc k.  Unt i l 7 
o' c l oc k the stor e was  open, Fr iday unt il 9 
o' c l oc k, I th in k it wa s .   An d S at ur da y,  
Sunday, it was seven days a 
week.  And then they open
ed up another st ore.  On 
Kingsley _________ Av enue,another supermarke
t.  In the beginning it wasn't 
good, in the beginning it
 wa s really, it was bad.  But t
hen with hard work
 and a little 
by little it was good
.  It was good.  He
 made money, we ma
de money and I had my 
home, which I didn't have a 
hous e but apart ments, which 
I was always in seventh 
heaven.  I kissed the 
gr ound in t h is  c o unt ry.   I  had 
my family, I had 
my food, I ha d 
my FrigidAir, I had
 my home.  What ?
 
Heshew:  She had 
nothing else to do, 
just kissing the gro
und.  Her husband was 
slavin g and she was 
k i ss ing the gr ound.  Not a bad idea.
 
A: [Laughter]
 
Q: You were making hi
m do all the work?
 
A: Yea h.
 
Q: What sort of net wor k wa
s t her e am ong Jews in gene
ral and Jews from the war?
 
A: Her e?
 
Q: Here.  In the 
neighborhood or?
 

A: W e ll her e we st arted lik e
 accumulating together.  Li
ke all the survivors.  One 
family  wa s looking for anothe
r one.  We got together.  
We had our own groups.  I 
really didn't, I only mingled 
with my family, which I had 
f am i ly, cousins,  they were  
very nice to me, very nice. 
 I had a big, beautiful family
 and t h ey  took m e in wit h  
open arms.  But 
concerning the _________, 
that we were calledall those years, the 
newc omers ,  the s ur v iv ors, we got  toget her. 
 We had our groups.  We start to play 
car d s, we let a norm al
 life.  Tried to lead a normal 
life.  Of course
, the past, you 
cannot f or g et.  And you c annot just let go. 
 It's deep in you're
 mind and in you're 
heart.  I think of it
 until the day you die.
  It will never, never, 
never leave us for one 
minute.  Those years back,
 even up until now we 
have the same organized 
organizations, wh ich is only 
by survivors.  We have Ne
w Year s Ev e part ies .   I got  
involv ed, years la
ter, I got involved 
in the ZOA.  We had 
a group, then we  moved 
to, this was many years late
r, t o Pelham Park way.  I got inv o lv ed t h er e.  I wa s  
Pr es ident of the __________, 
it 's  a Chapt er  from the Z O A.  Distr ict 20.  And we 
made like a Ladies Auxiliary, it
â„¢s a chapter of
 it  and I was Presiden
t for ten years.  I 
worked very hard, of course
 no pay.  And we raised mo
ney for Israel.  Our lives 
was quite normal.  I still did 
not talk about what I went th
rough to t h e k ids.  Unt i l m y  
gr andchildr en st art ed t o gr ow up and under s
tand what means, t hey
 st art t o lear n in 
sc hool and as k quest ions, t h en I st art ed t o t a lk
 about it.  Bu
t our life here
 was pretty 
good, I can't complain real
ly.  I never compla
ined and my husb
and worked very 
hard.   I never work
ed.  To me the kids were my f irst priorit y.  
And I t ook c are of  t h e 
kids, I didn't trust any babysi
tter s.  For five years I never saw a movie in this 
country.  Any place I 
went  t her e were t he k i ds  and t h
e kids and the ki
ds.  Later on, 
when t h ey  got a litt le older , 
I put my emphasis on 
education.  I tried 
my best t o pus h  
my kids through schools.  If they were weak, 
to, never had a babysitte
r in their lives.  
To, how you call it, someon
e to help my kids with e
ducat ion bec aus e I was n ' t  
knowledgeable enough 
in this  country to learn English.
  I never went 
to school here.  
What ev er I  lear ned, whatever I 
k now in wr it ing or r e ading,
 is only from reading.  I 
read a lot in those years, an 
awful lot.  And this 
is what  I tried t o pus h on m y kids.  
Send them to Hebrew
 school, send them 
to, I led a pretty no
rmal, Jewish life. 
Goin g to _________ 
___________ even when
 they, when my 
husband we nt to 
work I took both ki
ds, schlepped them
 to school
.   Of course
, the holidays, I was 
ver y c l os e wit h his family .  
He had a, t hen two or t w o-
and- a- half year s lat er,  after  
we came to this country, 
I t h ink two- and- a- half or 
three-and-a-hal
f year s,  we 
brought his mother, his sist
er with her family, a husba
nd and t w o k i ds, t o this  
country.   And I c o ns ider ed my self extrem el
y blessed and very lu
cky to be into a 
family.  Because I didn't 
have anybody from my mother
's s i de or my, I had my 
father's two sisters and some 
cousins here, but t
hey were very good, but surviv ors? 
I was the only one.  There wa s an
other sister of my mother 
with five kids.  They  all 
got killed in Lack-ma (ph).  In
 my town where I was born, 
the name of it is Lack-ma 
(ph).  They all got killed.  So I considered
 my s e lf v ery bless ed and v ery f ort unat e t o  

go into a full family.  They all came from
 Russia.  My husband lo
st his father right 
when the Germ ans came into their town, th
ey killed him immediately.  No, they 
didn't.  They took hi
m into a camp and t
hey burned him, to 
Be lz ec.   An
d he got 
burned, t hey bur ned him.  But  t he two br ot
hers and t h e sist er and t he m other  ar e 
ver y, very close.   All t hes
e years, they were in busi
ness together, we
 lived in the 
same area together, more or
 less.  I lived 
in ___________, the Pa
rkway, they lived 
on the Concourse and 
then they moved to
 ___________ Parkway, 
and then we all 
mov e d to Pelham Park way.  
And that' s wher e we liv e d fo
r eight years until I moved 
in here and I cons
id er e d my s e lf v e ry lu ck y t o be  in 
a family like this 
and my life here 
was quite normal.  
My hus band tr ied t o be in bus i ness
 all their lives, on his life.  He 
worked himself up. 
 Thank God he 
made a good living, al
ways.   M oney was n o  
pr oblem.  When I had 
the supermarkets, food, I always
 had galor e.  An d we wen t  
into real estate litt
le by little.  And thank God fi
nancially we did pretty well for 
ourselves.
 
Q: What s ort of t hings bec am e im port
ant to you based on 
you're experiences 
during t h e war?  Yo u said f ood, f or one.
 
A: My family.  My children. 
 To raise my children, maybe 
in a lib er a l way, m ay b e to o  
muc h  liber al.  M ay b e t oo m uc h of  liber al.  T o
 raise my kids, to give it to them, they 
shouldn't be hateful. 
 They should love all kinds of
 people.  They 
should be good 
people.  They should have 
professions.  They should
 have a profession and God 
forbid a war comes over or
 whatever, they should have
 somethin g to fall on. 
Bec a us e m y fat h er, if not this pr ofes s ion
 wher e he was  a bar b
er, we would never 
hav e s ur v iv ed.  See, I  wanted m y k i ds 
t o have som e kind 
of a prof es s ion.  O f  
cour se, I didn't want t hem 
to be a t a ilor  or  a c ar p ent e
r because this is not the 
Jewish m o ther' s t hing for c h ildren.  W hat
 does a Jewis h m ot h er want, is  her  
husband?  Her children s
hould be a doctor, a lawyer, a te
acher, at least a teacher. 
So I was pushing for te
aching for my kids.  
So bot h of my k i ds act ually, or iginally  
they bec am e teacher s.   My s on was a s p
ec ial educat ion teac her and my daught er, 
she wanted to be a veterinari
an when she was a li
ttle girl, but she 
was raised in the 
1960's.  She was not really a 
full fledged hippie, but kind of  on the very liberal side.  
She went to Binghamton, 
to school, ________ wa
s _________.  And what I said, I 
was pushing for teaching.  
No w she became an Anthropology
 teacher, she's a very 
br ight  girl.  And s h e was  
teaching anthropolog
y for a full year 
and then she came 
home and said, "Ma, I donâ„¢
t  lik e t h is pr ofess i on.   I don't  want  to be a n  
anthropologist."  I said
, "What do you want to be?"  "I want to be
 a doct or."   I  said,  
"You're cr azy.  Now,  af ter so
 many year s, so much work 
you put in being a teacher, 
now you want to be a . . ."  
"I want to be a v et er inar i an. " 
 Well, she's very bright.  I 
was against it.  The truth is sh
e took crash courses in Itali
an.  She was sh
ort in Bio, 
sh e wa s s ho r t in Ch em istr
y, and she went to Italy
 and she becam e a doctor  
veterinarian.  And s
he's practicing now.  And she's doi
ng very we ll.  She has her 

own place and she is  a ve
r y good vet er i nar ian.  My s o n bec am e a spec ia l 
educat ion t eac her.  And after 
a while he didn't like teachi
ng either.  He didn't want 
to be a teacher.  And he 
got hooked up with a friend 
and somebody 
else, I guess, 
and t h ey went int o Nut r a Sy st em Diet Cent
er s.  And t hank G o d,
 G od was good t o  
them.  He did very well.  
Very well.  He ma
kes a good living
.  Now the Nutra 
Sy st em is not s o well, t he Diet Cent ers, bu
t he makes a living, th
ank God.  He does 
pretty good.  She's also a teac
her, his wife.  A lo vely, love
ly Jewish girl, very nice. 
An angel of  a c h ild.  And t h ey gave m e t h
ree beautiful grandchild
ren.  And this is 
my whole life, I live for them.  I lived for th
em.  And I still do.  I 
still do live
 for the 
children.  This is my
 whole life.  Nothing else matters to me.
 
Q: An d you were talk ing about discussing the 
stor ies fr om the war 
with you're kids. 
I mean, did you discuss, did you talk abou
t it  with you're hu
sband?  Did you talk  
about it with other people?
 
A: With my husband, we talk
ed, yeah.  I talked
 to m y hus band, also not t o o muc h .  
Also not too much.  He never talked at al
l.  But also not too 
much.  I wa s going on 
with my daily  routin es of li
fe.  Getting up
 in the morning, cleani
ng, see that the kids 
should go out for fresh air, 
taking them to schools, ba
king, being with his family , 
being wit h my f am ily.  And 
this was more or 
less my life, was 
wrapped around this 
here.  Not  too m uc h  talk ing.  I star
t e d to really open up m or e when my  
grandchildren started to a
sk questions because it  wa s, 
when my kids went to 
school they didn't talk too 
much about 
the Holo caust.  They re
ally didn't.  Not in 
schools.  But at home, 
I couldn't  talk.  I didn't want to put this  pain on them.  But 
only when my grandchil
dren in Junior High Sc hool, I thin
k, started to ta
lk about it. 
And then they kept
 on asking questions 
and I really  started to
 open up to them. 
And I was sitting with 
them, they were writin
g and telling what I to
ld them and I told 
them what  I went t hr o ugh.  
They do know.  I don't know 
if they know every, little 
detail, but most of it.  They
 do, t h ey k now what I went  
through, yes, th
ey do know.
 
Q: How did you talk to your 
own kids?  I m e an, y ou'r e 
son was born in one of  the 
DP camps.
 
A: ___________.  He
 knew that I am a survivor and 
I went through Hi
tler and I lost 
my mot h er,  my sist er, my br ot her .   I surv iv
ed.   And that 's  how I 
met his father.  He 
knew that he wa s born in 
this DP camp in Fohrenwald,
 he knew about all thos e 
things.  Whic h is not, it 's painful and as 
a child they cannot rea
lize what this means 
and how much pain his 
mother went through. 
 And even, I don't k
now if  they know 
even the lo ss, if  they could 
feel what I lost.  If they 
could feel my loss and my 
mother.  I was raised withou
t a mother prac
tically.  When I n
eeded her the most s he 
was n 't t her e anym or e.   And I  
had to t ak e c ar e of ot her pe
ople all my life, in order to 
sur v iv e.  T h is was in t he part is ans, ev en 
aft er the war, when my f a ther married my 
stepmother.  Sh e wasn't a 
good woman and I had to pr
ove myself, to be good an d 

to be, and to do thi
ngs.  I always took care of so
mebody, all my 
life I, nobody, 
except I happen to ta
ke care of me, 
but I always did 
for people that my
 life should 
be eas i er or t o be good or t o impr es s 
people.  They shouldn
't  hurt me, they 
shouldn't leave me.  The 
fear of leaving wa s in
 me a lot, a lot.  Li
ke especially fear 
with my father of leaving.  
It was really k i nd of a, painf ul
 to me.  Ve ry painful.  Ev en 
here, being in this country, 
and he didn't liv e  her e.  T h
is  feeling went a w ay when he 
died.  It's like it was wiped 
away, like I wa
s  r eliev e d.  And up un
til then, until the day 
he died, just either I was holding on to 
him __________.  When he
 died, I wa s sure 
that, you know, God took him 
away and I cannot 
even explain.  I 
cannot explain the 
feeling of it .  T h e f e ar  that
 I'm going to be 
left alone.  But when
 he died, it s like 
something, a clock in me sa
ys well, this is, if he le
ft you and he will never come 
back and y ou hav e to tak e c ar e 
o f  yo urs e lf a nd yo u 'r e fam i ly.  T h is  is y o u'r e f a mily .  
You're father is go
ne, you cannot lay on 
him  anym or e.  You c a
nnot depend on him 
anymore.  He cannot save yo
u anymore.  These fears for 
some reason, it  wa s, it  
was a terrib le, frightening thin
g.  Maybe if  it was just 
me, maybe other 
people didn't 
have this, I don't 
know.  But I had this pain,
 I had this terrible pain.
 
Q: Before you're father died, 
what was you're relationship 
with him?  After the war, 
did you talk to
 him about that?
 
A: Unf ort unat ely, y eah,  we t a lk
ed, I talked to my father, y
eah.  I was like his life.  I 
was, I  am  by nat ur e, I was a str ong, s e lf- c onf
ident person.  
My father gave it to me. 
He was the one 
who inflict e d t h is on m e.  You ar e 
beautiful.  You ar e the smartest. 
You know how t o do t h is an
d he gav e me t h e c onfidenc e 
in him, in 
me.  He made 
me, what ev er I am now, he made m e.  But unfort unately,  c ir cum st anc es aft er  the 
war ripped us apart.  He went 
to Israel.  I went to this 
country.  Then he couldn't 
come here.  And 
he went to Cana
da.  As soon as he got to
 Canada, he was, from 
Israel he t r av eled t o Argent in
a, he had a s is t er t her e.  And fr om t here he c ouldn' t  
come to straig ht here
, but to Canada, 
through Italy, so he wa
s in Italy.  And I was  
always of cour se in touc h wit h him, c l os
e in touc h with him.  But really, bein g  
toget her he should s e e me grow
 as a wom a n, gr ow as a 
mother, grow as a wife. 
Having a family that, he ne
ver saw it becaus e he wasn't
 with me.  That's bother ed 
me a lot, it still 
does.  _______________
___, but when 
it came to 
_______________, for so
me reason it didn't work out.  
So then he li
ved in Canada, 
in Montr eal.  And I us e to go t here c o ns
t a nt ly, he us e to c o

_____________ __________ __________ when 
my son was born.  
It's not like you 
could hold his ______
_____ for my child. 
 It was just the ci
rcumstances didn't 
happen, it  just didn't ha
ppen.  I use to go a lot 
to Montreal, I open him a 
barbershop, I didn't have to
o much money then but I di
d my best.  
I opened him up 
a barbershop to make him happy.  They  wa nted to be there.  And then, 

unfortunately, he got sick.  
He got  sick.  He got sick a
nd I us e t o s c h lep him h er e,  
schlep him to doctors

had eleven surgeries, 

he had cancer in  his testicle

six or seven years.  Now, 
he would hav e been s av e d bec a us e m edic i ne

Q: Did you look back on the 
wa r together though?  Did 
those things you talke d  
about, were they
 about the war?
 
A: Yeah, we talk ed
 to each other, yeah. 
 With him I talked a lo
t, yeah.  But he was 
also one of those people who c
ouldn't  s e e m e  s uffer.  So 
he would start to talk, and 
he said , take her arou
nd it, around it, don't talk.  Do
n't aggravate your
self.  You'r e  
here.   You hav e a good hus b an
d,  y ou hav e a beaut if u l f am i
ly.  Don't go 
back.  No. 
Before he died, he called in
 m e and m y Unc l e and my 
Aunt, and he said, "Look to 
the High my kin", he 
said.  "You went thr
ough a lot.  This is 
you're firs
t _________. 
I'm dying.  I'm not going 
to make it, but I want yo
u to have a 
_____________ the 
way.  The way, 
___________, the 
way you want it.  That's
 you're first symbol in 
you're life.  Make a big ba
r mitzvah, make a 
nice bar mitzvah". He though
t that I 
was rich because I us
e to help him a lot and give him 
a lot.  I had e
nough.  Never 
complained on money.  An d he 
said, "Don't worry.  I'll be 
wi th you.  I'm going to be 
there every minute of you'
re step, watching 
you.  ______
_______, enjoy it."  And 
that's wh at I did.  I made 
him a big bar mitzvah, I had 
to give him __________, I'll 
have the music and I had 
____________ because 
he didn't trust me.  I had an 
extr em ely c l os e r e lat i ons h ip wi
th him, c l os e.  Bec a us e t h is
 is all I had, you know? 
And I s a w wher e other father s 
left their children, he didn
't.  He was re
ally watching 
ov er m e. He us e to wak e up in t he middle of 
t he night , touc hing t o s e e if I' m  th ere .  
If not, God forbid, some
 soldiers grabbed me
 som eplac e,  to rape m e  or som et h ing. 
He was  s o  ov er pr otect i ng m e. 
 He did.  He pr ot ect e d m e . 
 There's no en
d to it.  It's 
just, it was a time
 period in my life, in 
t h is c ountr y, t hat  I ha
d good times.  I rais e d  
my kids.  I was in volved in
 the ZOA.  I had the ______ 
club, rais ed money.  An d I 
was kind of  a very, very happy person.   No
w,  it  comes with age.   I think more than 
ev er.  W hy me?  Why did I no
t take my sister?  Why didn
't I sc hlep my mot h er wit h 
me?  M ay b e t hey would hav e s ur v iv ed.  It ' s
 like conscious.  I'
m not  blam ing m e, bu t  
act ually my  mot h er saved m y
 lif e.   She pus h ed m e out  
of t h e s e cond ghett o.  But  
maybe my sister would 
have surviv ed if I 
had grabbed her 
hand and take
 her to t he 
ot her ghett o.  W hy didn't I 
do that?  It's, I have more
 time on my 
hands now and 
many t im es  you don't s l eep at 
night, you t h ink.   A
nd I cry a lot.  I do 
cry.  And if I'm  
by m yself, I  say, why didn'
t I do this?  Why didn't I do 
t hat?  M a yb e t hings wou l d 
have been different.  
But I g
uess I'm not th
e only one.  I read a lo
t about it.  I read  
the book about the children, su
rvivor's children.  I think 
ev er ybody feels this way. 
I'm not the only one.  I hav
e a girlfriend, __________, s
he's going for therapy.  I 
mean, f ift y year s lat er.   And she just st
art e d to go f or ther apy bec a us e s h e c a n't  
cope with it , she can't live with it.  After fift
y y ears.  T h is is one of t h e gir ls,  s h e liv e s 

in New Jersey, that
 we s ur v iv ed toget her.  Her f at her
 actually saved my life up in 
____________.  He gave 
me this piece of fish and she 
is a very educa
ted girl.  She 
came here single, she went 
to school, she was a teache
r  at  St iv er son High Sc hool,  
and she just, now, _____________,
 she's not old, I mean, she just can't, why did 
she do this  and why didn't 
she do it  and why her sister
 got killed, he
r m ot her  got  
killed?  Three kids got 
killed.  Maybe she is blaming her
self a lot.  It's kind of lik e  
she went bac k to Lock -ma (
ph).  She went bac k to Lock
-ma (ph).  She's, her fear 
just in this age, she 
lives with this fear.  
I lost the fear.  I don'
t have this fear.  Oh, 
when I hear something happens to Israel
, I get panicky.  I'
m, you know, I get 
scared.  But the fear 
of bombing and 
running, it's gone.  This is gone.  You know? 
But we are, I think each and
 ever y one of t h e s urv ivors,
 is, h ow co u ld yo u s a y  it ? 
Very, very unhappy people. 
 With all the happiness, 
with all the money they made 
for all those y ear s, wit h t he c h ildr
en and t he gr andc h ildren and the homes,  
financia lly okay, I have
 this home, I  have a 
home in Florida.  Bu
t deep in you, there 
is certain pain that is unbelievable.  An
d each and ev ery one of
 us, whoever I talk 
to, it just, I think 
it  will go t o gr av e or  tak e it wit h 
us.   T h is  k i nd of thing that  we' v e 
been through.  It's no
t just sometimes a pe
rson is being killed.  To blame yourself, 
you blam e y our  f ather, y o u blame your  m o
t her,  y o u blam e the wor ld.   It ' s  just, 
________ at least you'
re aliv e and none of us is goi
ng to die young, but our whole 
lif e was k i nd of a, in pain
.  We lived in pain.  With 
t h e m oney ,  wit h the homes. 
Ther e was lik e  a c a nc er in y o
u t h at at e y ou up.  T h is  is  
life.  This  is our, even the 
times that we blacked 
out, we didn't wa nt to
 think about it, we  di
dn't wa nt to talk 
about it, this guil
t.  Guilt of dancing, guilt
 of drinking, guilt, we
 are guilty t o hav e a 
good time.  Why me?  Why 
not my s ist er ?  Why not my
 br ot her ?  She was  eight  
year s old,  t hat litt le gir l .  
An old lady  of  85, m y grandm a.  
 Had to get un
dressed?  In 
front of so many people and 
shooting, blowing her brains
?  Why?  Just because 
she was born a Jewish woman?
  So, as I say,  with al
l those richness that our 
________ have now, surviv or
s.  With all the good ti
mes, and we do have good 
tim es,  we go, we danc e, we
 sing, we have wo
nderful times.  Bu
t there's something 
that is eating you up in side. 
 Eating you up in side, like a 
cancer.  And it just, I think, 
it's me, I think.  
The older  I  get t h e wors e it ge
t s.  Ov er pr ot ect i ve of  my 
grandchildren.  Or if my so
n is  flying.  My gr
anddaughter is flying
.  My grandson is  
fly i ng, he's going by c a r, he' s
 going to come.  It'
s j u
st, what I went 
t h rough, m y son ,  
my only son I guess, I have
 a s on and a daught er.  It 
wa s in the 1960's and he 
was n 't a good st udent and I was 
afraid by 18 they'll take hi
m to Viet nam.  Well,  this 
was the last thing I would have
 done.  I would have
, but I went to, no
t to in order for 
him, he shouldn't go.
 
End of Tape 2.
 

 Tape3
 
A: I just couldn't see,
 God forbid, they will 
take him to Vietnam, 
to another war, h e  
could get killed.   And I  couldn't
.  I just, I went from doct or  to doctor, trying to ma ke 
him sick.  I tried to, he s
houldn't go to the, 
not to the __
______ army, but I forgot 
how you call it.  I pushed 
him into a school in Louisi
ana.  He was such a bad 
student.  I mean, la
ter on he picked up 
and he really  is  a 
great guy, a very 
successful businessman
.  And he, we  pushed 
him into a school in
 Louisiana and h e  
was there and he was doing bad
 and I wa s afraid, if  he's go
ing t o  dr op out, t h ey  ar e 
going to gr ab him int o  the Army
.  He had to stay in school
.  I went, at that time he 
developed some boils from ne
rves.  He wa s never away fr
om me too, he wa s like a 
mother's little boy, you k
now?  I was always protective, 
t he Jewish mot her .  Iwent  
to doct ors,  t o skin doct ors,  th
is is like I'm sa
ying it here, off the re
cord.  I almost took 
him out  for $10, 000. 00 in t h os e 
y ears.  I cr ied m y ey es ou
t.  I told him my story, I 
said, I cannot afford to
 lose him.  I almost say yes,
 I almost paid so
mebody off for 
$10, 000. 00.  I was going t o 
get him out.  Becaus e I c oul
dn't afford, otherwise if I 
wouldn't be able to do this  
I would grab him and take hi
m t o c ountr ies or of f t o  
Canada or someplace.  He  w
ould have never we nt in to 
the Army, never, never. 
And I wa s running from place to place to pl
ace, telling my stor
y, why I cannot  send 
him to the Army.  Why it 's not fair.  I lo
st so much, wh y should 
I lo se another child 
now, t h is is all I hav e.  And, 
but luckily, I mean, lu
ckily all of it was 
v ery f i xed, I ' m not  
sure, but the numbers ca
me out.  I don't 
know if you know this 
story, in the 1960's, 
they drew lott ery num bers.  And his num ber 
was t he f ir s t one t o be out.  Then I  was  
safe with him.  Then
 I was safe with him. 
 I never gave my kids
 swimming lessons.  
Now my grandchildren have 
ev er ything bec aus e they d
on't listen to me.  They 
swim , the big ones swim 
too, but I  was pr ot ec tiv e.  I  wa
s ver y, ver y, ver y protect ive.
 
Q: Do you t h ink you cr ea
ted, I  mean, is it,  
c a n y o u creat e s om et h ing of an ord i na r y  
lif e like ev eryone ar ound you 
wh o didn't go through the ex
per ienc es of the war?  I 
mean,  what  ot her t h ings s ort  of color you'r e
 experiences, as youâ„¢
re creating you' re 
family?
 
A: You mean an eff e
ct  on my children?
 
Q: T he eff e ct on t h e f a
mily  that you built ?
 
A: I'm sure it  did.   I'm sure.  There's 
a lot  of  book s now wr
itten, especia lly my 
daughter I thin k.  Sh
e's a rebel.  She ma
rried one non-Jewis h 
guy for no reason at 
all.  Then she divo
rc ed this one aft er t e n y e ar s an
d she married ano
ther non-Jewis h 
guy.  T h ough I hav e a good re
lat i ons h ip wit h  her, she love
s us very much.  She is a 
ver y br ight,  v ery  pret ty  c h ild.   But  may b
e she pick ed up here and ther e about  what  
Jewish people go through and sh
e married these non-Jewish
 people.  Maybe that' s  
a reason to it.  An d my son now almo
st always says, _
______ _____
____ ____ 

________ _______, 
they're sick in the h
ead.  All ________
 children.  Bu
t I think you 
ar e norm al,  you ar e okay.  It di
dn't effect you.  He said
, but lu ckily you didn't talk 
about it.  Because I hav
e a niece here wh o, she's not cr
azy, she's very br ight.   She  
has her pr oblem s I t h ink a
nd s h e blam es t hat her m o th
er talk ed too muc h.  She 
hear d t h at her m other  talk ed
 about the, what she went 
thr o ugh, t hat s h e wasn' t  
__________.  I was not 
in a concentration 
camp or Dachau or 
Auschwit z.  Her 
mot her  was  a Russ ian and s h e blam es, s h
e was married, she 
was divorced.  She 
is not stable.  Very bright 
gir l, v er y br ight.  She blam es
 her par ent s  of talk ing t oo  
much about the Holoca
ust.  That's why she's screwed
 up.  She does.  An d there 
are a lot of books wr itten about 
this  kind of a thing, the ch
ildren of surviv ors.  That 
they do have problems.  So, 
I don't know.  I don'
t think, I donâ„¢t think so of my kids, 
that they r eally have pr oblem s bec aus e of th
at .  I really don't t h ink s o.   My daught er,  
may b e s h e' s a litt le r e bel,  s he m arr ied 
one non-Jewish guy on 
top of anot her no n-
Jewish guy.  Maybe this has an
yt hing to do with t h at.  Bu
t  I don' t  s e e my s o n or my  
grandchildren, any effect of 
the war.  Maybe they don't talk
 about it and tell me, but 
I don't think so.  I really d
on't because I didn't 
show.  I didn't show, I didn't talk, I 
didn't act.  I was always vivaci
ous, outgoing pers
on.  Always.
 
Q: Did the war change y
ou're views on you're connecti
on to Judaism 
and later to 
Israel and even to
 religion and God?
 
A: Yes.  Yes.  I ca
nnot  be part ial t o non-
Jewish people.  I don't 
trust them.  I donâ„¢t  
believe in them.  I j ust, for 
Israel, I would give my life
 of cour s e.  I work ed non-
profitable organizations only to rais e money 
and t o send to Isr
ael.  When it comes 
to non-Jewish people, I donâ„¢t 
have any confidence in them
.  I don't trust them.  I 
don't.  Be cause we lived 
next door to non-Jewis h people.
  The same non-Jewis h 
people who robbed my house.  
Grabbed my brother's vio
lin.  Killed my brother. 
And I s a w what they did.  
Ho w could I have co
nfidenc e in t hem ?  How c o uld I t r ust  
them?  T hey us e to c o me in
to my  fat her' s barbers h op,  
eat and dr ink, and into my  
house wher e we liv ed.  My father ' s best fr
iend.  And t hen when 
I came to them to 
as k for a piec e of br ea
d, they t hr o w me out 
of  the hous e.   On t
op of that, they wer e  
the worse killers in the ghett
o.  The worse killers.  How 
could I have 
confidence?  
How c o uld I trus t them ?  None
 of them.  None of them, 
unfortunately, I don't trust a 
non- J ewis h per s on in relat i on to Judaism.
  I don't.  I' m a good Jew.  I 'm no t  
religious.  I'm not saying 
religio us Orthodox religious.
  Deep in 
me I have a 
conv ict i on,  you k now?  I 'm Jewis h.  Tr adit i
on.  I love th
e Jewish tradition.  And I 
gave my kids a Jewish tradition.  No t 
religio us maybe, I should have and mayb e 
this  wouldn't have 
happened with my 
daughter, I don't
 know.  But I'm not a young, 
Israel person.  I'
m not.  I am a, I wouldn't 
say a liberal.  I try to 
teach my kids liberal. 
Liberalism.  I tried. 
 They, m a ybe not to hat e eac h ot
her.   Bec a us e it
's wrong.  It's 
so wr ong.  That one 
r ac e s h ould hat e t he ot her like t
hat.  It's so wrong.  It doesn't 
br ing any, ev en now, when 
I see wh at's going on in Bo
snia, I can't 
understand.  

Why?  Why can't everybody, you' re Jewis
h, be Jewish.  Yo
u're Moslem, be a 
Moslem.  Don't hit me, I wouldn'
t hit you.   You do your  ow
n t h ing.   I' m going t o do  
my own thing.  I can't unde
rstand this.  Why hate each ot
her li ke that?  For what 
reas on?  I  hav e a r i ght to pr
ay for my prayer, bu
t as long as I'm not
 hurt ing you.  I 
don't care if  next d
oor to me lives a __
________, but donâ„¢t hit 
me, don't hurt me, I 
shouldn't be afraid of you. 
 Be my neighbor.  Be a good 
person to co
me into my 
house, we' l l have a c up of c off ee, we' l l ta
lk  about business, ab
out the children. 
Why hate me only becau
se I'm Jewish or you ar e blac
k ?  God cr eat ed us like that  
so why hat e each ot he
r lik e t h is ?  F or what  r eas on? 
 I  c an't under st an d t h is.  And I  
taught, I was teaching my kids
 t he sam e way.   But st ill, 
I didn't trust them.  Because 
for all t h e 2,000 year s we ar
e being, we are the one, now 
we have in Bosnia, it's 
__________, it 's different re
li gions, but those, way ba
ck, you didn't have those 
things.  T h ey  always,  ev er y r e
ligion hat ed t h e Jews.  Ev er
y religion hated the Jews . 
From 2,000 years ago.  Why? 
 If you believe in God, God 
made it this 
way.  Jesus  
is  not  t he God, G o d made J es u s, yeah? 
 Jesus made himsel
f as a, Jesus was 
Jewish t o o.   So why hat e eac h
 ot her?  We work har d.  We
 came to this country.  
We were never on 
relief.  Never on 
footsteps.  I had
 neighbors, nice 
people.  So my 
husband went to work, he
 scrubbed herring.  Came
 home, he was smelling of 
herring.  Never saw his chil
dren go to bed and
 get up in the mo
rning.  We worked 
hard for my _______, fo
r our money, very ha
rd.  Why can't othe
r people do this ? 
Why hate the Jews
, bec a us e t hey ar e har d work ing 
people?  The truth is, I have the 
highest respect fo
r the Oriental people.  I love th em.  They are good people.  They 
don't bother me. 
 We have them in my
 building.  They go, 
they work, 
they work 
seven days a week just like
 my husband worked.  The fa
milies are the back of the 
room.  T hey eat  what ev er is left ov er, 
whatever my husband had
 left over in th e 
supermarket, he brought 
it home, I made a me
al out it.  They do
 the same thing.  
They are beautiful peopl
e.   T hey hav e a r i ght to liv e 
like anybody else
.  They work 
for t h eir money.  T hey ar e fam
ily orientated people.
  And that' s what  
I tried to instill 
in my k i ds, this k i nd of a liber
al way of life.  But it doesn'
t work.  It still doesn't work. 
One bad t h ing about t he Je
ws, and boom, ever y body' s on t h e Jews.  Ev er ybody ' s  
on the Jews.  A plane's going to explode, t
hey ar e going to blam
e t he J e ws.  T hat' s 
why I would lo ve to ch
ange the world.  They
 should be one race.  
If there's a lot of 
races, to teach them how to
 get along t oget her.   How 
to live together.  How to 
compromise.  But I gue
ss, I don't know how. 
 I'm not, I'm too old 
and maybe if I had 
been born here maybe I would hav e som e 
kind of knowledge.  
But I, so I guess I 
am in a wa y a liberal.  That I donâ„¢t tr
ust in non-Jewis h peopl
e against the Jews , you 
can't blam e me f or t h at.  W h at I  went th
r o ugh.  What  I saw 
with my own eyes. 
Though,  s o me Chr ist ians ar e v e ry nic e t o
 me, very nice.  Th
ey gav e m e f ood .  
Gave me a haircut.  Gave me 
shelter.  So, but the maj ority
 in this worl
d is against 
the Jews.  The majority of 
people are against the Jews.  I 
can't straighten this out.
 

Q: You s ay that y o u'r e Jewish c u lt
ur ally, but may b e not religious l y?
 
A: Yea h.
 
Q: Were you rais ed religiously ?
 
A: Not really, my fat
her wa s a liberal.  He  couldn't ca
r e  less  t hat  he
's a, we  had a 
kosher home.  W e had a gr andm a in t h e hou
s e, in t h os e y ears, we had t he kosh er  
home.  My father went to 
Shula (ph) ever y Saturday , bu
t not really Orthodox.  I 
nev er had non- k os her  food in m y  hous e. 
 My mother came from a more religious 
home than my f at her.   They cam e  from  t w
o differ ent  back gr ounds.   My f at her  c am e  
from working people.  As  
a matter of fact, my father
's also a musician, wa s a 
mus i c ian.  Ther e wer e  ten c h ildr e n in his f am i
ly.   T h er e were four  boy s and s i x gir ls.  
And my grandpa wa
s a musician.  As  a ma
tter of fact, they 
took everything away 
from me, I would have shown it  to you.   
I have a picture and one
 of the books  whic h 
was cr at ed by Bashevitz Si
nger (ph) and he has my gran
df at her t here play ing t h is  
fiddle, t h at I  gav e t he men. 
 He was playing the fiddle, 
what I gave to this Museum 
now.  But they have everything
.  They still didn't send it
 back t o m e.   I should really 
be aft er t hem.  So they  were all f o ur brot he
rs,  they were musicians
, all of t h em.  My  
fat her play ed all t h e instr um e
nts,  you j ust nam e it, pian
o, just natural, naturally 
came to them.  I don't think 
that, none of them 
knew how to play by
 notes, they all 
played just from their heads. 
 I was trying to br
ing something up, bu
t I  f or got  what  I  
was going to say.
 
Q: Oh, we were j ust talkin
g, I guess I was wondering w
het her y o u' re exper i enc es  
during t he war c h anged y ou'r e f eelings on
 being a J e w in this
 country and other 
places?
 
A: Well I was a child ye
t.  I really  didn't know much a
bout any religious, religions of 
the wor ld.   I had a k os her home,  as  I said.  
 And my  m o ther us e to
 bak e br ead.  It  
was a small town and holly 
and ________ we ate toget
her, Frid ay night we at e 
together.  And ___________. 
 We were not like a young
 Israel, I wouldn't say 
young Israel people. 
 More tradition with a kosher
 home.  Jewish traditionally  
establis hed people.  But no
t _______, no.  We
 were not _________.  An d I still am 
the same way.  Same way.
 
Q: Have you gone back 
to Poland or hav e y o u had any des ir es ?
 
A: Yeah, I do hav e a des ir e. 
 I do have a tr em e
ndous desire.  I wo
uld like to be in 
this grave.  I was in this 
grave right after the war and 
I saw the big gr
ave.  Through 
all t h os e year, whoev e r s urv ived in I sr ael,  th
ey really worked on
 it and they mad e  
the ____________, now ther
e's no more Communism, 
but when it  wa s the 
Communism even, there was a ni
ce gr oup of Jewish, if  I w
ould have been in Israel, 
I would have been over there many ti
mes, in Lackenbach
.  But in here, 

unfortunately  there's not too 
many people in  Am eric a.  Th
ere wa s one girl wh o lost 
her husband and one woman, wh
at I was telling you, that
 she has some problems, 
mental pr oblem s and she st il
l, now she's going through 
gr oup t h erapy, s he' s go in g 
to a ps yc hiatr ist, like t he whole t h ing cam e 
back to her, you k
now?  It wa s like, she 
can't live with it, it
's  just t orm ent ing her.   T h e past
 is t o rment ing her.  And I don' t  
hav e any b ody t o go wit h.  But from I sr a
el they go constant
ly.  They put up a 
gorgeous monument, gorgeous.
  Even for the Ru
ssians, yet.  A big monument wit h  
all the parades and all the, whatever has 
t o be done, and all 
the names.  W hoev e r  
is lay i ng in this grav e, my mot h er,  my 
sister, my br ot her,  my Aunt s, my gr andm as ,  
ev er ything is wr itt e n down.  A big,  big,  
beautiful monument.  A
nd many times, they 
go like ever y year, when it  was fiftieth, th
ey  ar e t h er e s inc e 1942
.  So they had like 
a m em or i al ther e and ev er ybody  from I sr a el
 went.  I had to go
 fr om Am er ic a.  I  
hav e a bac k problem and I ha
ve this  anxiety at
tacks, up until now
, but in different 
ways.  And from this, I had nobody to go
 with.  Last year I wanted to go, my 
younger grandson 
want ed t o go wit h m e, and f or  s om e
 reason it didn't work out.  I 
hav e also a stom ac h problem, 
I have a terrible case of colitis.  So I get nervous.  I 
sit  on t he bathr o om mor e t h
an I'm outside.  And my 
husband says, well, you're 
going t o  go by your s elf.  Ho
w are you going to 
tr av el?  You hav e  
to either go to 
Israel, go with t
hem  to Israel or you hav e to go t o
, m eet t hem in Wa
rsaw.  He didn't 
want t o go,  he' s not a well
 person.  He had two open-he
art surgeries already.  So  
he s a id, I c annot go wit h y o u.  And m y f a
m i ly s aid, Babba, why are y o u going to 
go?  You hav e plent y of aggr av
ation, you still talk
 about it, sleep with
 it, why?  Don ' t 
go.  But I'm dying to go.  I am dying to go
.  I wa nt to go.  But I don't know how to 
work it out.  Maybe 
to go to Israel and go with them to Israel.  Fr om ther e to go.  But 
from Isr a el,  they  are going c o nst a nt ly.   Ever
y December ther
e is  a big, big, beautif ul 
monum ent.   They t a ke ver y well
 c ar e of it.  And m a ybe s om e
day, if I leave, I'll go.  I 
will.
 
Q: Yo u mentioned before that you find your
self thin king about 
those events more 
and m or e ?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Do you have any sense wh
y?  What that's happening
?  And did you not thin k 
about it f or a while as y o
u were living
 your life?
 
A: I wasn't thinking for a wh
ile.   T h er e was  quite a num ber
 of  y e ars  in bet w een that I  
really didn't think.  I wa
s so involved with the ZOA 
and raising money for Israel,  
buy i ng bonds, s e lling bonds, gett ing dr es
sed up, playing cards, rais ing my two 
childr en, t h at I r eally didn't 
even thin k about it.  
I didn't thin k about i
t.  I just kind of 
lik e  blac k e d out.  Somet im es  we got t o get he
r, you know, a bunch of us, survivors, 
and we talked about it and then
 when I left I had a normal 
life.  Now it 's kind of like 
more and more on top of me.  More and more
 r em i nder s of  it.  I 
think more about it. 

I am more in the house by 
mys e lf, the k ids ar e out of my lif e, t hank G od t hey'r e 
doing well.  I don't know, but I ask some pe
ople, s urv ivor s, as a matt er of f act I  
guess I 'm not the only one.  Becaus e t hey
 opened up her e on Pierc e Blv d. gr ou p 
therapy of sur v ivor s.  Just survivors.   
A whole bunch of them
.  And hund
reds of  
people are going there.  And I wa s 
thinking maybe I s hould go there too.
 
Q: And how does it come
 back?  I mean
, do you think 
about it  at ni
g ht,  dur ing t he 
day?  Just certain im ages
 come back or what  come
s back int o y
ou're mind?
 
A: Images.  What I we nt thr
ough.  How I went out of this 
ghetto.  It bothers me a lot 
that my s is t er, at least  my sist er, my mo
ther was only, I didn't realize how youn g 
they were.  My mother 
was thirty-six years old.  I didn't
 r ealiz e t h at, I ' m miss ing, lik e  
I'm m is s i ng that s i de of the 
family.  I think about what 
I  went thr ough in part is ans  
and my father died so
 young and he really
 didn't have enough 
time to have na-has 
(ph) from m e.  And we 
ta lk no w, we g et t og e
ther, our survivors, we
 t a lk ab o ut it.   Do  
I have maybe less
 to tell than the concentration 
camp people, then from Au schwitz, 
Treblinka, My-don-ick (p
h), you know they had it  wors
e.  T h ey had it wors e than 
me, as bad as I had
 it they had it  wors e.
  And we  talk about it
, we do talk about it 
and it  bot h ers  me m or e, it
 bothers  me m or e my  s is t er, t h at m y brot her didn't  
sur v ive.  You think what yo
u went t hr ough,  you 
see on tele vision certain things. 
You see t h e m is p lac e d people, 
it comes back to you.  It
 com es back wit h and you 
feel sorry for those people.  
But now they are being helped
 from people all over the 
world.  I say, wh y wa sn't we
 helped?  Maybe it would ha
ve been different by us if 
people in the world would r
ealiz e what's happeni
ng to us?  Maybe we would have 
had some help like t hos e, I 
s e e t he c h ildren, it r eally
 br eaks you, you know? 
Though t hey ar e not J e wis h, but
 it doesn't matter.  They
 are people.  They don't 
deserve this kind of a trea
tment.  They are plain, diff
erent, ordinary people, why do 
they hav e t o get involv ed in 
t h is  k i nd of a way  of lif e? 
 And then you know, your own 
lif e c om es  bac k, those y ear s, and t h ey 
s ay, well now at least they ar e lucky ,  
everybody's trying to help 
them and fight for them.  No
body fought fo
r us.  Nobody 
heard about us.  Some
 may think, well ma
ybe they were 
happy to kill 
us out once 
and for all, the Jews, and get 
rid of them.  But they didn
't, thank God.  So , I don't  
know.  Every chance I have 
now I run t o the kids, m y gr
ands on, m y whole life, my  
whole pleasur e, I r u n t o t he k ids.  You t h ink 
I make this punch here for myself?  No. 
For the kids.  All for the ch
ildren.  An d this is my li
fe, the kids, now.  __________ 
not going to die anymore, I 
would like to __
_______ in the hous
e from the kids 
bec aus e they ar e good k i ds, t hank G od.  Ve
ry pr otect i ve ov er m e , ver y pr ot ectiv e  
over me.  Babba don't do this
 and Babba don't do that and 
very proud of me when 
we go places, they 
introduce us.  We we
nt to my grandson's co
llege graduation, I 
didn't stop crying for one minute.  I said
, this  happened to me. 
 I lived to see a 
gr andchild gr aduat ing college? 
 It's just unbelievable.  It's
 just like I'm pinching, I'm 
alive, I'm dead, I got 
killed in the partisans, 
I got killed in the g
hetto.  This is my 

child?  This  is my grandson graduating from co
llege?  I lived to see it ?  Yes, I did.  
Yes I did.  It's  just sometimes you wake up
 and you say, no, that
's not me.  That's 
not me, that's really not me. 
 M y daught er' s a doct or ?  I s a
id, no.  I don'
t deserve it. 
Why God chose me to 
have a daughter a docto
r?  Why did he ch
oose me for that? 
What did I do right?  I didn't do anything right.  I didn
't _____________, now 
through the years I pr
obably did plenty of 
wrong things but by 
then I was twelve 
year s old.  How much wr on
g could I hav e done?  W hy 
did He choose
 me and not 
my s i st er or  my br ot her ?  So all t h os e t h in
gs take you ba
ck for some reason, it just 
takes you back.  I have one son, my 
grandson is in No
rthwestern, such a 
pr est i gious sc hool.  O n the ot
her hand I'm so
 t hr illed t hat it 's a fr ee country ,  that 
being J e wish t h at m y kids c oul
d do what ev er they want to 
do.  I didn't, 
at least they 
could do.  And t h ey c ould ac com p lis h and 
they could go to the best schools and we 
could afford to pay fo
r them.  So I'm bles
sed, I'm blessed but 
probably I took away, I 
took with me the blessings for my family
,  for m y br ot her.  
W hat ev er belonged to 
them probably, I took it away.  I wasn't self
ish, it wasn't up to
 me.  See, we are 
screwed up people.  With all 
the best in our lives.  We
 are still screwe d up people 
and t h at' s it .  I mean, s i x y ear s is a long t ime
 to suffer, a lo
ng time.  I tr
y to be goo d  
to people, I give a lo
t of charit ies, a lot. 
 I help, try to be help
ful to people, doesn't 
matter.  Whoever comes in, 
they are homele ss, I feel 
sorr y for t he hom eless.  I  
alwa ys give them somethin g.  
For Israel, for ZOA, forget 
about it.  Ha- d as s a (ph).  
A l wa ys  in v o lv e d in s o met h in g.  It mak e s me  ha p py.
 
Q: Well, thank you very 
much for talking and 
sharing your stories.
 
A: Your welc om e.  Well, at 
least t h is is I guess some of
 it, I think I'm sure there' s 
more to it.  And when you thin
k about it  and you sit and say,
 if I did not 
tell this, why 
I tell that?  But it wa
s funny, it 's vague, it 's
 mental even.  I wa s 
laying down in front 
of t h is building, t h e build
ing was burning, 
I was halfway uncons
cious and here I 
have my father standing in 
front of me.  I me
an, what is it?  
Fate, somebody was 
watching over me?  Well, he 
was asking people and they to
ld him that this group is 
here and t h is  group is there,
 look here, look here, look 
there.  And he was lookin g 
all over.  The building was 
burning and out of 
t e n m i nut es I  would hav e been on 
fire.  All of a sudden, 
he' s ther e r i ght in fr ont of m e.  
To schlep me on
 his back.  To 
save me.  And there's othe
r things, who remembers all 
those things?  But I was, 
from 1939 until really we ru
n out of ghetto, I just, I was 
a s m art  c h ild.  I didn't  want  
to play with children,
 that's all I did, is  reading, 
reading, reading, re
ading.  Polish, 
Hebr ew t hen and Rus sian, fr om my par ent s .  
 I didn't play wit h childr en.  Ev en f o r  
the two years when the Ru
ssians were there, I was 
also very u
nhappy.  And 
though, in Am er ic a I am a 
happy person.  People thin
k I'm a very happy, outgoing 
person.  But certain things 
I don't remember.  
I was six months wi
th those peasants, 
when my father was in the 
partisans, and I re
member nothing.  I 
don't know what I 
ate there.  I don't 
remember, I just remember sleepi
ng on that oven and burning my 

fles h, was burning.  But th
e r est of it, and then when t h
ey cam e t o  pick m e up.  I  
don't ev en rem ember wh
en they left me ther
e.  I don't r em ember what I at e, what  
did I do?  They didn't 
k eep m e f or nothing, I must ha
v e been either  wit h the s h eep 
in t he f i elds  or helping,  do
ing s om et hing wit h the k i ds.  
I must have.  Nothing.  And 
chunks like this of my life, 
like they are just out.  I don't
 know why.  Completely out.  
That 's t h e stor y of a s urv ivor, my  dear.  
But  unf ort u nat e ly, ev er y wee k is diff er ent  
funerals.  If Hitler would come up, would wa
k e up now, and see 
that we still, we 
hav e a lot  of  gr een- na ( ph) , s u rv iv ors,  
who liv e d a long,  l
ong age and
 lived a 
beautiful generation
, left a beautiful generation of
 people, lawy ers, doctors,  
politicians, on television, he
 would drop dead again.  
And every time, I use to have 
a speech, I'm good in
 those things, I have 
to get it out now.  If Hitler would wake u p  
and see what we are doing 
here and the genera
tion we left.  We
 left, believing 
beautiful people behind us.  A 
beautiful gene
r at io n.  T h is is j ust
 t h e first gener at ion ,  
how about the second generat
ion?  That will co
me up also, doctors and la wyer s 
and reporters and in volv
ed in polit ic s.  A really big, 
m ost  of  our  k i ds  ar e ed uc at ed 
people.  Ninety-nine percent of
 our surviv or's children ar
e very highly educated.  At  
least a t eac her, many mor e, many ar e a t
eacher.  So I guess 
we' ll never go.  The 
Jewish faith, the Jewish relig
ion and Jewish peopl
e will survive, will 
survive.  They 
are supposed to be t
he chosen people, but I don't 
see it.  Why pay such an 
expensiv e pric e, I can'
t understand either?  
But Hitler didn't wipe 
us out.  No way. 
No way.  No way.  
They are going to be alive and fr
ee and now we ha
ve to work for 
Israel.  No w we'll have to se
e that our generation and ou
r second generation, thir d, 
they should be all Ju
daism, should be aware, and real
ly stand guard.  I don't know 
how,  but they are educated
 people, like, God should 
give, Swen-ton Da-Yah-ho 
(ph) is a young powerf ul ma
n.  God s hould give him the 
wisdom and lead us on th e 
right track and Israel should surviv e.  
And we are human peopl
e and we are people 
in the world, the people wh
o come up with us, that 
we ar e a Nation, we ar e a 
People.  And we hav e t o s ur viv e like any b od
y ,  lik e any ot her Nat i on has t o s urv ive ,  
who G o d cr eated.  It does n't m a
tt er, black, white, gr een or
 r ed.  If G od put us her e  
we should surviv e.  And one 
should not kill the other.  
We should help each other. 
So now we'll have see 
that Isr ael s hould s ur v ive, t h at
's all.  Thank you very much.
 
Q: Thank you 
very much.
