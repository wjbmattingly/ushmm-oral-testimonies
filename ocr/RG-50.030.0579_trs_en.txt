Q: And how and why di

A: I got a letter, it said  greetings. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But before that, another 
friend of mine, we graduated in 1940, we tried to enter 
the service then, in 1940. 
He went, and I couldn™t go cause I wore glasses. 
Q: I see.

were your attitudes regarding the wa
r, how did you feel about the war? 
A: Well, at that time, we™re 
young. And when  they bomb ed 
Pearl Harbor,
 made us 
kind of mad. We took it as a joke, tell you 
the truth. And we Œ 
and after we started 
reading stories about it, 
and stories about Œ about 
Germany
, and it turned us, 
started turn us. And, wh en the Œ 
I went in there, down to Camp  
Forrest, Tennessee, 
went through training down there. Then I 
went through training 
up at f-fort Œ Camp 
S-Salano
(ph), 
Kansas, 
up at Camp  
Phillips. 
From there we sent us out to 
Yuma, 
Arizona 
to desert training. Then  they sent us to
 New Jersey. New Jersey
, the

training there was about how many bars 
you could go down th e street without 
getting drunk, from the camp. 
Q: And how long in  Œ how lo
ng did that training take? 
How long of a period of time 
was that? 
A: Oh, let™s see. Was y ear and a half in training. 

Q: Right. And was that all statesid e, 
or Œ wh at happened  when  you went to 
Euro pe
? Was there more trai
ning in  Œ in Œ in 
Britain
? 
A: In Œ in a Œ we got to 
England
, was there about four
 weeks, picking up 

ammunition and waiting fo r our turn to  go
 across the channel. We did some tr-
training over there, ni Œ mo stly night trai
ning. But the nights over there are not too 
long. 

Q: Right. 

A: Right, okay. And Œ and then  we
 left there, went down through 
Southa mpton,

Southampto n
 to 
Utah 
Beach.

U-Utah 
Beach. 
Q: When  Œ when  did you arrive there, at 
Utah
? 
A: Boy, that™s a hard date to find. I can™t remember the date. 

Q: Okay, no worries. Do you fe
el that Œ all of that traini
ng, did it adequately prepare 
you for comb at?

A: I was in regimental headquarters, a
nd mo st of the people in regimental 
headquarters are specialists, one way or 
the other. I was in communications. And 
then Œ 
[background voices] 
Yeah, 15
th
 of August, that™s when I got over there. 
That prepared us, I think, that year and 
a half, compared to 
what they™re training 
now, you know, weeks. They
™re not getting enough traini
ng. And Œ and we got in 
France
, and we do Œ was in the war.  
Q: Right. And you said you were
 a radio lineman, is that right? 
A: No, I was a wireman. 
Q: Wireman. 
A: Wireman. 
Q: Okay . 

A: In the wire section 
the Œ in communications. 

Q: Right. 
A: And I said that most ever
ybody in that regiment headqu
arters were specialists in 
something, radio, telephone, and my  
R 
and 
R 
platoon, and they were specialists 
their own about seeking out the men Œ en
emy. And actually, the training was 
enough, cause we knew how to string a line, we knew how to make ties in the line 
for communications, and go out and repair 
them after they get Œ get shot up or 

broken up, and that™s what we did. 
Q: What Œ can you tell us about 
your first combat experience?

A: First comb at experience, I took a Polis
h prisoner, first day. He was wearing a 
wine colo red suit. He was a Œ he was ope
rating a machine gun. He wasn™t pulling 
the trigger, he was just loading them. And the 
SS
 officer was abou
t 50 to  75 yards 
in back of him, with a st
ring tied to the trigger of th
e machine gun, and he pulls Œ 
pulls the string for that machine gun to op
erate. And these guys were supposed to 
stay there and load it up when
 it™s empty, load it up. If th
ey didn™t, he™d shoot them. 
And the Œ this man come out of the wo ods 
there, put his hands 
up when  he saw me. 
And so I called the Œ our sergeant, pa Œ 
Sa wyer. 
He was from 
Sewickly
, he was 
Polish. I says, what™s he talking about? Well,
 he says, he™s been in that Œ been  in 
that position for two days now with no wate
r and he wants a dri
nk. He says, don™t 
give him anything. I gave hi
m a slug of water out of my
 canteen, and he was very 
grateful for it. And that was my fi
rst combat experience right there. 
Q: Yes. And did you Œ were you at all involved in crossing th e 
Moselle
? 
A: How™s that? 

Q: Were you at all involved in crossing th e 
Moselle
? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And can you tell Œ tell us about that experience? 
A: We crossed the 
Moselle
 on September the 12
th
, and that was me an and nasty 
fighting down th ere. And th at™s where I got
 the Bronze Star first Œ I mean, first 
time. And what happened wa
s, they put us down in
 a defensive position at 
Dilliard
(ph). As a Œ right above a church, a ro 
Œ dirt road went up
 the church, went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
8
 
 
up th e 
OP. 
And they had shelled the 
OP
, and quite a few of them were killed up 
there. And they™re sending an ambulance up 
there. And they told us that the Œ we 
had to stay there in this pos
ition. So I start digging a little
 bit. And the first time the 
88 co me in, and I digging Œ started diggin
g faster, you know, I was really shoveling 
dirt there. What happened was that that, th
ey had notified the guys in back  of me, I 
was a Œ oh, about Œ about 50 yards in front
 of them. And they 
rolled back under a 
big apple tree, and I was out in that bend in the road that goes up the hill. A 
Dilliard 
there from 
Dilliard.
 And I happened to look across th
e field, here come a German 
patr Œ patrol across the field. And there 
wasn™t supposed to be a German on that 
side of the river. I saw  they™re getting clos
e, closer and closer 
to our position, and I 
start cuttin g loose at them 
when they got too close. 
Q: How were you armed? How were 
you armed? Wha-What weapon were you 
carrying? 
A: The 
M1 
Q: The 
M1 
A: 
M1. 
Q: The carbine or the full sized? 
A: The Œ the Œ the full 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Right, good. 
A: Yeah. And th en I knocked off the la
st three in that patrol, there was 
approximately nine of them. 
And I knocked off the last 
three, and I thought, it™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
9
 
 
funny, I don™t hear no shots behind me. He
re what happenedwa
s the sergeant come 
up and ordered the men under the tree to fa
ll b ack. And they forgot to tell me when 
I was up there digging. And th
at really made me mad. 
Q: I can imagine. 
A: They left me there by myself. I knocked 
off the first three, and the rest of them 
gave Œ saw the three were 
being knocked off, they disa
ppeared. And to this day, 
when I talk to 
Felix
, he was down in a building in  there, and they  said he™s Œ he said 
it™s all the same patrol. That™s another Œ 
he™s over there, and so th en, actually, I 
wasn™t supposed to be doing that work. I™m
 Œ I™m a Œ I™m a wire
ma n, but I had to 
defend my position, and I did. And not on
ly it happened then, it happened during 
the whole war, especially in the Battle of 
the Bulge. And from 
then on, when we Œ 
well, after Œ after 
Argentan
, 
Argentan
-
Falaise
 Gap, that battle up there in 
France
, 
that was the beginning of it,
 and then when  he got to 
Moselle
 river, which driving 
across 
France, 
you know, 50 - 60 mile an hour, ho
w fast you want to go, until we 
got to 
Orleans. 
And I got a picture of 
G 
Comp any in
 Orleans.
 Did you ev er see 
that picture? One guy was carrying a sniper rifle. And then the 
[indecipherable]
 got 
to 
Moselle
, that™s Œ that™s where what, 317
th
 lost 300 and some Œ 365 men, wasn™t 
it? Across that river.  

A2: The battalion, the battalion. 
A: Huh? 
A2: The battalion lost that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
10
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, we lost 365 men right ther
e at crossing. And wh ich I thought, and 
some others too say 
[indeciphera ble]
 you know. Back in Œ 
back before this war 
started, when I was in school, I studied  hi
story. My family goes back as far as the 
year 1205. I™m entitled  to wear a deer™s head 
[indeciphera ble]
 with a dagger 
through his head. You know wh
at that means? It means yo
ur ancestors fought in the 
Crusades. And I had a relative fig h t in all wars, from 
[in d ecipherable]
 World War, 
Civil War, Span ish War, American war, and the Œ like, I had a uncle Œ great-uncle 

was killed in World War I. He got the 
DSO
 for what he did, but he died for it. He 
rescued two of his buddies out on the fiel
d, and he got machine-gunned. And th ey Œ 
they named a street down in Fort
 Bennin g, Brockman
 Way, because he got the 
DSO. 
And Œ so our family™s been
 in a Œ wars, all wars. 
Q: Can you tell us about the battle Œ your 
ex periences at the Battle of the Bulge? 
A: Cold, cold, let™s put it that way. We we
re gonna left Œ I was gonna head to Œ was 
heading to 
Beechy
, out of 
Saint Avold,
 
France
. We got down th ere about 11 
o™clock at night, and we was to go across into 
Beechy, Germany
 there. And they 
said, never mind. There™s trucks up there, 
get on them, you™re going for a long ride. 
So we took the lo
ng ride up to 
Lux embourg
, a hundred  Œ hundred  mile way. And 
the first stop in 
Luxembourg
, there™s a bend in the road going from 
Luxembourg  
city, up to 
Mersch
. There™s a big bend road . The Œ in
 the middle of that bend is a Œ 
is a bar, a café. And that™s when
 we first got our first booze in
 Luxembourg
. We 
got 
Luxembourg Œ Mersch,

don™t know who kn
ocked that out Œ knocked out tank 
there. And I knew th en something™s wrong up
 here, we™re just going up here for a 
holid ay. But we got up to 
Mersch
 and then  we head
ed up north to 
Ettelbruck
. 
We™re still going riding
, riding at night. 
Ettelbruck
, we took the ba
ck road above
 
Ettelbruck
, and it circled down  around 
Oberfeulen
 and we went into  
Niederfeulen. 
And that™s where we stopped for a couple weeks right there, 
Niederfeulen.
 And then from 
Niederfeulen
 we went to 
Heiderscheid
, 
Heiderscheid
, and then there was a lot of 
towns, small towns around there.
 Tadler
 
and 
Kehmens
(ph). And from there we went to 
Wiltz. 
A fter we hit 
Wiltz
, it w as 
miserable cold. And we™re going up to  
Buchholz
, and that was cold. The wind was 
blowing like crazy. And the town where we 
stopped, that was it. And they put us 
back on th e trucks again, and 
they took us down south to
 cross into Œ over to the 
crossing to 
Depburg.
 What was the name of that river? 
A2: 
Sauer

over there, first trip when I went back wa

stopped there at 
Diligen
(ph). It™s a Œ where we cr Œ wh
ere they had the bridge head, 
that was the Œ some farmer. And he wa
s mad at us, even then. Because the 
engineers come in a
nd knocked his barn do
wn to make a crossing. And I still ta Œ I

didn™t do it, you know? And then , 
we crossed there, and then into 
Bitburg
, and 
come back down. Back
 down, we come back
 down in to Œ to 
Luxembourg
, and 
from 
Luxembourg  
we crossed over the river again, 
and we stayed over there, that 
si Œ this time, we stayed 
over there. We went into 
Saarburg,
 
Saa rburg
 and up to 
the t-town, little town of 
Oberzerf
. That™s where 
Turner
 got his medal, 
Oberzerf.

A: Well, who got Œ who got the

Oberzerf
? 
A2: I don™t know.  
A: Ri-Right there, we crossed there, at 
Ze r f
, and
 Oberzerf
 was before 
Ze r f
. And 
that™s where they throwed these Screaming 
Mimis
 at us, in this town. And it hit the 
General 
McBrid e™s
 
Jeep
, flatten ed it flatter th
an a pancake. And the 
communication officer, Officer 
Dolka
(ph), well, anyway , he got his 
[indecipherable]
 blown off, and that™s the last I sa
w of that guy. A
nd Œ and then we 
went thro ugh th e wo ods to 
Gemirth
(ph), and we stayed in a cellar which was a 
grocery store above us. And 
I went down th e cellar, that
™s where they got all the 
bottles, and the whole platoon stayed 
down in that cellar that night. 
Q: What did you select? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
13
 
 
A: They couldn™t get out, we couldn't ge
t out because they was throwing mortar 
shells on us. And so we Œ we was drinki
ng schnapps, chasing 
it down with white 
wine. Don™t ever do it again. And from then
 on, we went down  through th e Œ those 
woods, 
Gemirth
(ph), and what was the name  of 
that town? If I had my map here 
I™d tell you. That we went to 
[indecipherable]
 and from 
Kashdra
(ph) we went 
north  to 
Ma in z, 
crossed the river 
Mainz
 and from there up to 
Kassel
. And went up 
to 
Kassel
 and Œ and then we headed down  to 
Eisenach. Gerdt
, 
Netbray
(ph), the Œ 
Auto ba hn, 
on the 
Auto ba hn, 
and we got to 
Weimar
. And it™s four of us in the 
picture there. We just decided we need 
some drinks and we 
asked these people in 
Weimar 
wh ere it was. And the one man says, yo
u go up this road, he says, it™s two 
farmers up there, and they make good schn
apps. So we went up that road, and we 
got within about thr
ee miles of the camp. Now, we di
dn™t even know the camp was 
there, we didn't know anything about thos
e camps. They never told us about the 
concen tration camps. And we Œ I was drivi
ng the truck, we had a three-quarter ton 
truck, a 
Dodge
, and I was the driver. And I asked 
Billman
, Corporal 
Billman
, I 
says, do they  have mo nkeys over here? He
 says no. I says, well look up in  them 
trees. And there was the inma
tes.  They saw us coming fi
rst, before we saw them, 
and they  went up in  the trees to hide. And 
one of them was Italian, and the guy from 
Œ 
Siberelli
(ph)
 
from
 Altoona
, he™s Italian and he can sp
eak the language. We asked 
him about it, what Œ wh at you™re doing th er
e? And they told us
 about the camp. We 
didn™t per Œ still didn™t believe them. So we  took them up the 
ca Œ road up there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
14
 
 
What™s the name of that mountain up th er
e? Well, anyway, we took them up that 
camp, and we drove in the front gate. There 
wasn™t a guard around, in fact they had 
disappeared  about three days befo re, a
nd th e Americans or anything else, six 
armored Œ they heard the six armored ta
nks coming, and they took off. And we 
went in there, and we saw the sights, we 
saw the bodies, the piles of bodies were 
right there, and that was it. And it made us kind of mad. I™m gonna speak a little 
rough now. And we stayed th
ere Œ we got there on the 11
th
, we stayed there in 
Weimar
 on the 12
th
, and th e 13
th
, 14
th
 we left. We started going east then, we had Œ 
was ordered to le-leave. And well, we went 
back over there, this past year, on the 
Holo caust day. The people, 
I kept asking them, all over the city, you know, I says, 
you tell me  why you was Œ why the camp  wa
s there. We didn™t know it was there. 
So, that made me kind of mad. I just told
 them, I says, you™re full of shit. I says, 
your kids were playing up in  that camp 
during the war, the whole time, the kids 

were up there. They knew it was there. An
d you could smell it. You could smell it, 
the camp, from miles away. That™s six 
miles up there t Œ from the downtown, and 
you could smell it. And so then , when  I come th Œ was up th ere on the 12
th
 of April 
this year, they had the ceremony ab out everyt
hing up there, and was greeted by this 
man  fro m 
Ukraine, 
a Russian. And then wh
en Œ when the book 
I got, it™s in my 
case here. Okay. Yup, yup. It was Œ no, th
e little black book in the case. Little b lack 
book. These are the pictures 
we took over there. This wh
at my  daughter made up. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
15
 
 
This book I brought over there. It™s in Englis
h. That™s got the pictures of everything, 
Buchen wald
. 
Q: Mr. 
Brockman,
 let™s Œ let™s back up to the 11
th
 of April, 1945. You said you 
weren't told about the concen tration camp s 
and about their existence. Yet, as you Œ 
when  you Œ you first made contact, what 
did you th ink you were seeing? What did 
you think you we
re taking in? 
A: The Crystal Night, I read about 
that before, back here in the
 States.
 And I 
always was a reader, and a history man. A nd I read about that Crystal Night, and I 
just wondered, you know, why the people 
let them do that. And you figure you got 
a guy with a black mu stache on, he™s the bo
ss, period. What he did, wh at he said, 
what he ordered, if you didn™t do it
, you Œ you were s
hot, you know. These 
SS
 guys 
will sho Œ sh oo Œ shoot you.
 I had a run in with a 
SS 
man where this picture was 
taken here of that Œ that there. We were
 talking to those two 
Po lish prisoners. That 
was in the middle of some town after we left
 Weimar
. That™s where we Œ where it 
is. Those guys were walking home 
from that part of the country to 
Poland.
 We told 
him stay still, you™ll get transportation, 
you know? No . But anyw
ay, they was in a 
house. They were in a, like a slav e labor
 camp. And was four wo men, three story 
house, four women. And th is one come 
down, when we go in to
 the town, she was 
covered with blood. She had 
a broken nose, busted jaw, her body was beat up. And 
I says, what happened to you? 
And she told me. She said, the 
SS
 man  ov er th ere, 
she says, he tried to rape me. I 
says, you mean that private, the 
SS
 private? He says, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
16
 
 
he™s not an ess Œ he™s not a private, he™s 
a captain. I says, you™re
 sure about that? So 
she called her other girlfriends out of the 
house, and they  says, yes, he™s a captain. 
And he beat hell on her, cause he tried to ra
-rape her, right then and there. And well, 
he got four 
M1s
, right quick  like. Four of shot him, because he had no right to live. 
Q: Were you speaking to the wo man 
in English, or did you have a Œ 
A: How™s that? 
Q: Were you speaking to the wo man in English, or Œ 
A: English, yeah. 

Q: What town was that, do you recall? 
A: A town? 
Q: Yes. 

A: That Œ I don™t re-recall that town. If they
 bring that Œ that book wh ere they took 
that picture, I would know. Bu t we run acros
s several of them going down  si Œ when  
we left Œ left Œ we left the Œ the air Œ area there 
Gera. 
Now we were south. And we 
ran in Œ across several of those camps. 
Labor camps, I mean
, there wasn™t the 
killing then, there was just Œ 
Q: Work ing. 
A: Œ u Œ use their bodies, that™s 
it. And then  we got down  to 
Austria ,
 we stopped at 
the 
Enz 
river, that™s Œ couldn™t get no further 
cause we™re supposed to meet the 
Russians there. They took three or four da
ys getting th ere. But I Œ that Œ now, when  
this first started out, my  daughter says, 
why don™t you go? I sa
ys, no, I says, I Œ I

said, I had enough of it, and I didn't want 
to be reminded. You don™t lose sight or 
track of it in your mind, of wh at went on
 over there, during 
the whole war. You try 
to, try to move ev erything back here. Bu
t di Œ you don™t, you can™t. And some 

people say they do, and I don™t know, I™m 
aware they™re li Œ they can™t. Because it™s 
something th at happened to 
you. It turns you. And then, 
when we got these camps, 
we got the 
Buchen wald
, we got the other camps, that 
really turns y
ou off unto the 
German people. Although, th
ere™s a town up in Œ above
 Hannover
, 
Germany
, it™s 
called
 Brockmanville. 
Due to the fact we had Œ the 
Brockmans
 were kicked out of 
England
 way back befo re th Œ it was Crus
ades times. And th ey went to 
Germany
, 
lived in 
Germany
 fo r 200 years. And they  come back over to 
England
 and they 
come back to 
England
, then from there 
they went to 
America
. I got a great-great-
grandfather Œ well, a couple mo re 
greats, he™s buried down th ere in 
Chester
 county, 
phi Œ 
Philadelphia
. He was buried down there in 
1690. That™s how old we are. 
Q: Sir, you said it Œ th-the whole experience in  
Buchenwa ld
 and the other camp s, 
did it change how you felt about the war, 
and why you were fighting it, and your 
role in it? 
A: Yes, I Œ it did, du-due to the fact th
at I was always a happy
-go-lucky guy, e-even 
during th e war. We got through 
France,
 I was still a happy-go-lucky guy. But th en 
when  I saw the 
Buchen wald
, and I saw the bodies, and I saw everything there, it Œ 
and then  you get to thinking 
about it, it™ll change your 
mind real quick. You™re not a 
happy-go-lucky guy, you™re a killer then. Ev
en though I was a wireman, I sti ll had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
18
 
 
to get rid of some guys in our way. And,
 well to this day, my daughter still don™t 
know. All she knows is 
[indecipherable]
, and who was the other woman? And she 
started putting everything together. This pi
cture here, this guy, that™s him right 
there. That was taken on the 12
th
. 
Q: You said it changed Œ the experiences
 in the camp changed th e way you felt 
about the Germans and the German people. 
A: Yes. 
Q: 317 stayed on a little bit in 
Germany
 after the war was o
fficially over. Did you 
stay on as well, for Œ 
A: It was official over on Œ 
on the seventh. May the eight
h was the official day. We 
pulled out of there, was it the Œ was it Œ 
Kurtsdorf
(ph)
, Austria.
 And then  we went 
over to 
Spital
 
am Pyhrn, Austria. 
We stayed there, I think 
about two, three weeks. 
Then  we moved down to
 Füssen,
 
Germany
, down  that part down there. And I liked 
that part down there, because  that™s where they sent a
ll the women, down there to 
get away from the bomb ing. So  
Œ but anyway, on June Œ June 23
rd
, I think it was, or 
24
th
, I got a letter from my aunt, and sh e pa
ssed away now, but I got a letter from 
my aunt saying my brother had been killed over in 
Europe
. He was killed on May 
the 10
th
. That™s two days after the war he wa
s killed. He was ground crew chief on a 
B17
 out of 
England
. And their plane was flying ov
er, dropping Care packages to 
Holland 
and  
Belgiu m.
 He was dropping Care packag
es there. An airplane was 
coming in, another plane wa
s taking off, they come t
ogether. Two planes ti Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579

comp letely burn up. The only 
way you could identify him is
 by his teeth, after the Œ 
and he was buried in the ceme tery, 
Cambridge, Eng la nd. 
And then my  uncle was a 
grange man, and he says, let™s bring him b
ack over to sir Œ so we got him arl Œ he™s 
buried in 
Arlington
 now. And my sister,  she was a Œ 
she retired as a lieutenant in 
the
 WACs
, she spent her time down in 
Japan 
wh en
 
occupation. So then, wh at did 
upset me about my  brother, because they 
didn™t no Œ the govern
ment didn™t notify 
me, which they should have. And, we brought
 him back. But just a lot of things you 
Œ people ask me different questions, and th en 
it starts coming back just plain as day. 
And I kind of hate that a little 
bit, because I was trying to 
forget it. But when I come 
back, I was Œ we come back 
on a Wednesday, but Œ see, 
my  daughter had to go with 
me, she had to be my  caretaker, you know, on
 the trip, on that trip. And, well, she 
wanted Œ so then, we flew b
ack. We just got back in ti
me when that volcano blew 
its stack over there, out there, you know. 
And so we made it in
 time. Well then, the 
next day, on Thursday, th
e ra-rabbi from synagogue in 
Wa-Washingto n, PA,
 he 
called. And he™s a jolly fellow, real fat.
 Beard. Very jolly. And don™t ask me his 
name, I can™t remember. He says, would y
ou like Œ would you speak in front of the 
congregation on Friday? I said , all right. So I got over ther
e, I got to talking to him 
before he had this Œ we had the service on 
Friday night. And he 
says Œ and he Œ he 
made his talk at the service about us sold
iers. He says we should talk and tell about 
the war. He says, when they don™t, then Œ 
th en his whole sermon was about that, we 
should talk. Well then, he 
introduced me, and I asked him, I says, how long you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
20
 
 
want me to talk? He says, about 15 minutes
. It was two and a half hours befo re I got 
out of there. Them people have all ears 
and everything else. And I passed out there 
Œ I passed 150 of these out to them. And 
my daughter got them, where she did I 
don™t know, don™t ask. But I™m Œ so then he
 called me again, he said, why don™t you 
come back over and do it agai
n, and he says, we™ll tape 
it. He got Œ so I started, 
from the time I went in the 
service to almost what™s Œ 
I come home. Took two and a 
half hours. I didn™t cover all of it, but I cover mo st of it. And then  the Œ what was 
the name of the lady? So unds like tobacco. 
Judy
, that was it. She called, she wanted 
me and my  daughter to come over and have
 lunch with them. So we went over 
there. And it™s quite Œ quite interesting. Es
pecially doing the service. And th e book 
was in English, so it™s Œ songbook.
 I sang right around with them. 
Q: You said Œ you said th
at you did not speak to you
r daughter about it, did you 
speak to Œ about Œ did you sp
eak to anyone in you
r family about your experiences in 
the war? 
A: I talked to no one. 

Q: And why is that? 
A: Not even friends, not ev
en when I go down to  Americ
an Legion or the vets, I 
never told about war. I never said that wo
rd  to anybody. And, I had a good friend, 
by th e name of 
Worth
, 
Da nny  Wo rth
 from
 Washington, PA.
 Not 
Washin gton 
state. 
Danny Wo rth,
 he™s buried over there in 
Lorraine
 cemetery. At 
Sain t Avold,
 
he was killed 
[indecipherable]
. They had an  88 up the ro
ad, straight up the road, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
21
 
 
and I told him, I says, we go
tta get in this other house, cause they got a better cellar 
in there. It was brick 
[indecipherable]
 brick and that. And he
 never made it. That 
88 come down and took his throat right o
ff. Now here™s a guy that when I go down 
to 
Columbia, Tennessee Œ 
you know what 
Columbia, Tennessee 
is noted for, 
besides mu les? And 
Lansing, Michigan 
the same way. They got the prettiest g irls 

in the st Œ in the cou Œ in the 
United Sta tes 
there. And I drove a truck to 
La nsing ,  
Michigan 
before the war, and then Œ then I fo
und out. But he would be s Œ he 
would actually blush walking do
wn the street with a girl. That™s the type of man he 
was. He never swore, he never cussed or anything like that. He was a radioman in 
the Œ in the comp any, and th at Œ he™s sitting in the 
Jeep
 wh en a shell come in, took 
his throat off. He™s buried over there. Now 
here™s a guy here, he went to church and 
all this. An old reprobate like me is still 
alive andhe™s dead. 
Can you figure that 
out? Why the good persons go? I can™t.  

Q: Let™s back up a bit to 
your actual training, when you
 were in training. Do you 
recall anyone Œ do you r
ecall anybodyvisiting your 
training camp? Was there 
anybody important who visited your camp? 

A: We had the President 
Roosevelt
 down there, driving through. We spent three 
days out in the drill Œ drill field putting up 
a pump that™s Œ and everything was lined 
up with a string, all the way down throug
h that whole camp , the whole division, 
that™s 13,000 men. And he drove th rough th
ere with that cigar in his mouth, that 
cigarette lighter Œ ha Œ holder, rather. He
 drove through that camp, boom, about 90 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
22
 
 
mile an hour I would say, you know. An
d that™s the only one Œ so, like that. 
Roosevelt
, that™s the only one come down sa Œ we saw. 
Q: Was that a thrill for you? Did you enjoy seeing him, the president? 
A: Well, I™m not a political 
man, I never liked politics.
 And, course they got 
politicians at home now, th
ey™re giving me awards an
d decorations, by a dozen 
now. I said Œ I just got one from 
Tim Murphy
 over here to Œ House of 
Representatives, and his secretary was there 
ya Œ last night, wasn™t it? Yeah, yeah. 
She was there. And she hand that to me. I say s, oh-oh, I says, did 
Barba ra
 have 
something to  do with  that? That™s my  daughter. And sh e says, yup. And 
Mu rph y , 
Tim Murphy, 
because he™s House of Representatives. 
Q: I™m Œ I™m sorry to keep 
coming back to the issue of
 the camps, but after having 
seen the camps, labor camp s, did it change
 how you interacted
 with the German 
people? 
A: I can™t tell that story, no. 
Q: Tell us. 

A: No. Yes, it did. It changed. Like, we 
mo ved in their houses, you got 10 minutes 
to get out of here, we™re ta
king over. And we ha
d one town in  a part of the country 
of Œ part of 
Germany
. It™s where the people were ger 
Œ women wear their hair in a 
knot on top of their head. And 
I think it™s above Œ it™s up around 
Kaiserslautern, 
Neustadt.
 And this wo man says, what are you 
doing over here to us? We were at 
the door, told her we will like, tak e your
 house, you know, and this. And she says, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
23
 
 
what are you doing here? We didn™t ask you 
to come over here. She never made it. 
She got a .45. That™s when it 
start turns. And, if they didn™t get out of our way, we 
knocked them out of our way.
 And we had to let them k n
ow we were soldiers, and 
we let them know th e hard way. We got down to
 Austria
 in 
Spita l am Pyhrn
. We 
got in a house down  there, and they had r
oom for us, we didn't have to kick them 
out. And the one girl™s name 
Heidi
, very beautiful blonde. And she was Œ I™d say 
she was strictly a Nazi to
 begin with. Her mother was Swiss, her fath er was 
German, and he owned about 
two or three blocks of 
Berlin
 up there. That™s where 
she™s born and raised, in 
Berlin.
 And I asked her, I says, 
did you go out there and 
heil
 this that, 
heil 
this, the guy there, and the Œ wh en th ey had the big parade? Sh e 

says no, I says, I don™t believe you. Well,
 we left there and I come home, I got a 
letter from her. And she™s telling about, 
you know, she™s having ro ugh time. So we 
collected a box of clothes, and my  wife se
nt her her mother™s je Œ coat, with fur 
around th ere. We sent the clothes over to 
her. And we was friends with her for all 
these years. And when we 
went over there Œ I™ve been
 over there seven times. We 
went back  first time over in ™72. And we 
went over there, we would always look her 
up. And she took us into 
Austria
 this last time we saw her, and her mother is in a 
nursing home, at that time, 
I think she™s dead now, in 
Austria
 down at Œ at 
Kitschdorf.
 She had nice apartment, balcony overlooking the 
Alps
, beautiful view 
from across that valley for 
Kirshdorf 
there. And it cost her 28 dollars a month to 
stay in that apartment build
ing. And th at™s going down st
airs to the kitchen to eat, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
24
 
 
you know, free of charge. But it start Œ I st
arted relax a little bit then when I got 
there, because the war was over then. And Œ 
but she also give me a good wine to 
drink too, when  I want a dr
ink of wine, or Œ she give 
me good wine. That™s why I 
become friends with her. 
[indecipherable]
 Bu t it™s hard to say, you know, if I could 
do it over again, I probably would. 

Q: Why? 
A: Well, the same situ ation, everything el
se, I™d Œ being now, do it over again, you 
know something. You™re a 
little bit sharper on what™s
 going on in the world. 
[coughs]
 Excuse me. Then, when 
I read that book about the Crystal Night over 
here, well that start tearing me right then
, you know, could peop
le do this? And then 
it started Œ the other book I 
read about the Jewi
sh population over there, how they 
were be tr-treat like that. And I was never 
taught to be another nationality, or to be 
mean to them or anything like th at. My 
mother was Irish. If I was Œ did anything 
wrong, I got clobbered. I mean, I got the pa
ddle, mo re than once. And that kind of 
straightens you up a little bit. But then th
e Œ when the Œ is 
Œ in school, when 
ﬁLife
ﬂ 
magazine come out, first come out, and they
 had some pictures about over here, at 
that time, and I Œ I couldn™t understand 
it, why people could 
do th at. And that™s 
what I told these we Œ people from 
Weimar,
 I couldn™t understand. That™s where 
Hitler
 got his start, out in 
Weimar
. That the hotel was in, he did his speaker out of 
the balcony that hotel. That was Œ that wa
s nice hotel. My daughter, she don™t eat 

fish. First night was over there, she went 
like this to the waite
r, you know. And she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
25
 
 
says, I don™t eat fish. Well, he got another pl
ate. Boy, did she get a plate. Everybody 
says, we want that too. And so that go on 
for about three days lik
e that, my  daughter 
call him over. If she didn™t like 
stuff, they™d change it. We
 got treated royal. So I 
called them over, I got my finger going, I 
called him over one da
y Œ one night. And 
I says, we can have anything, and you™ll 
get anything for us
? Anything you want, 
we™ll get for you. I says, I want a 
Mercedes 
van. I says, I want a 
Mercedes
 van. I 
didn™t get it. 
Q: Do you remember hag Œ r
eceiving your orders to go home? 

A: I was down
 Füssen, Germany
 in the in 
Schwangau-Horn Schwangau,
 that™s 
where I was at, and right below the castle neu, the 
Neuschwanstein 
castle. We had 
a whole hotel down there to ourselves, our
 communication wire section. And we 
was going Œ going out on a wire trip
, was driving. And th ey say, 
Brock
. I says, 
what? They says, pack up, you™re going 
home. And it hit me real quick. I was 
surprised. I thought I was going to 
Japan
. Says no, you™re going home. And to tell 
you the truth, I was really sad. Those guys were down in that truck, which I had 

been driving all that time, 
and they™re going out on a job,
 and I™m not going. It upset 
me. I was, I was Œ upset me. I never saw 
them guys until the-th
ey come home. Was 
after they had families and everything else. 
This one had about fo
ur or five kids.
 
Siberelli
(ph) had about four or five kids. 
Billman
 had three. And I drove up there 
and saw them one time, and that™s the last
 I saw of them. And one of the guys from 
the 80
th
, he said he was from 
Williamsport. 
He says, I think
 Billman™s
 dead , 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
26
 
 
because he remembered 
reading a story about a 
Billman
 in the paper. And I know 
Siberelli
(ph) probably dead, because he was a big drin ker. And 
Harry Eckrel
(ph)
, 
I don™t know too mu ch about him, cause he was a nut. 
Q: What was acti Œ wh at was coming home like when  you actually arrived 

stateside? 

A: When I come home, I left 
[indecipherable]
. They says come ba
ck, come back in 
five days, there™s too many of 
us, they couldn™t take care 
of us. So I went ma Œ went 
back to my  hometown. You know, I didn™t
 get a handshake, a greeting? Because I 
was coming home early, and their husbands we
re still in the service, they were a 
little mad about that. So then I got a job 
the next day after I was discharged, on 
October the 25
th
. I got Œ come home, next day I went and got a job in the mine 160 
for 
Consolid ated Coal. 
And I™ve Œ a year later I got married, I raised a family. I 
didn™t cry in the booze about anything Œ 
ab out anything, cause I got a job. And Œ 
which was a good th ing I got that job, cause
 my  wife is handicapped now, she can™t 

walk. She™s down th ere now, 
riding around in an electri
c wheelchair. She™s no Œ has 
no knee on her left leg, it™s a Œ it™s 17 inch es
 of steel plates. And she come up to the 
place I was staying with Œ people I was stay
ing with Œ my mother
 died when I was 
16, and I lived with this other cou Œ 
family. And she come up there. She™s a 
hairdresser and she™s dressing this woma
n™s hair. We become friends, we got 
married. Cause the boy where I was stayi
ng with, he come home from the service, 
and he had to have a place to 
stay with his wife, they were
 si Œ raising a family. So, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
27
 
 
I says, we might as well get married. She 
was a telephone operator, worked  out of 
Delaware
 during th e war. 
Q: This interview that we™re conducting is Œ is for future generations. What would 
you mo st like future generations to
 know about what you experienced? 

A: Boy, that™s a rough questio
n. I would like to have th em experience that I had, so 
they know what war is abou
t, then they™ll know. Same
 experience. Maybe there 
won™t be no more wars then. If everyb
ody Œ everybody know
s about them. But 
we™re not Œ we™re not go Œ we™re gonna ha
ve wars, always. We™ve got it right now 
o-over there now. Now we got to worry ab out 
China
. They™ve got a 
rocket going 
off and it goes 900 mile, knock out a ship 
out, out in th e middle of the ocean. What 

are they gonna do about that? 

Q: Is there anything you™d like to say in cl
osing, sir? Is there 
anything you™d like to 
say in closing? 
A: Oh, I don™t know. Like this rabbi says
, you should talk about it. If I had some 
maps here, you™d be here 
a couple days. So  I™ll s Œ I™ll say to each and everybody 
else, stay out of the war. That™s the only
 thing I can say, stay away from war. It 
don™t do you any good. Physically, and 
mentally, it knocks ya. And you th ink 
sometimes you might fo rget about it, but 
then something happens, or you read 
something in  the paper, or a magazine, it brings the me mo ry back ag ain. Course in 

my  house, I™ve got books after books about the war. And 
DVDs
, now it™s
 DVDs, 
and I got a big stack of them. But they, like 
Ba rbara 
said, my  daughter says, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
28
 
 
never tell me anything about the war. 
[indecipherable]
 I got the books, and the 
DVDs
 and all that, reading about it t
oday. I watch everything th at™s on 
TV 
about 
the war. War as I knew it and everything else, those programs. And I cuss some of 
them, I says Œ that was my  big mistake, you know. It was a big mi stake in certain 

parts of the battle. When we crossed the
 Moselle
 river, we lost all those men due to 
the fact one man, he come down from divisi
on and he ordered a third battalion to go 
and attack at three o™clock in the after
noon. You don™t go and 
attack three o™clock 
in the afternoon, you wait til 
morning or night. Broad da
ylight he ordered attack 
third battalion go in there. Colonel 
Roberts. 
He blamed Œ blamed the big wh eels for 
that. He™s dead. And there™s certain inst
ance like that happen
ed during the battle, 
the whole time. The mistakes they made, I don™t care if 
[indecipherable]
 was 
O.C.S., 
come out of there, in 90 day wonder
s. You wonder how 
they got that, the 
rank. And they didn™t know any better wh
at I Œ wh at I know. Cause I had a high 
I.Q.
 When I went in to the Œ took the 
I.Q.
 exam out of Fort
 Mead, 
mine was very 
high. They says, oh you™re Œ you
™re goo Œ eligible to go to 
O.C.S.
 And the one 
sergeant says, well, you can™t go, you got 
glasses. Well, you see this medal right 
here, the one in the middle? 
Q: Yes, sir. 

A: That™s a Good Conduct Medal. I got th
at the last day I was discharged. The 
sergeant says, you don™t have a Go od Conduc
t Medal, I says, no, I wasn™t too good. 

Q: We thank you for the interview, sir. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 
29
 
 
A: Yeah, I Œ 
Q: Thank you very much. 
A: I still say that Œ that we have the leader
ship, we won™t have this trouble. But we 
don™t Œ we don™t have our le
adersh ip any more. If we had good leadership in Œ in Œ 
over there in Congress and that
. They™re sitting on their bu
tts, that™s it, they™re not 
doing anything. We™re going to get into it 
somepla Œ I guess. It™s gonna happen. I 
don™t know, I™m 90 now, and I Œ I won™t Œ 
probably won™t be around to see it. I™ll 
try to stay around, 
but I ca Œ forget it. 

Q: I hope you do. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Thank you, sir. 

A: Thank you. 

Q: It is 14:22 hours. 
Conclusion of Interview
