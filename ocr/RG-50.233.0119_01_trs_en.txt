Interview with Norman Salsitz 
Re: Family Members 
 
A: So you asked me , July the eighth.  No, wait, 
wait, the month.  In poem you wrote first the 
month.  {Female voice: The date.}The da
te, yes.All right, it was March 7, 1930. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: {Fe male voice continues: This is machine? } 

 

Q: Oh, it™s okay. This is just for some  of --. 

 

A: All right, March the seventh 1930. 

 

Q: And we™re using Shulim not Shalom?  Right? 

 

A: His name  was Shulim actually, not Shalom. What do you have? 

 

Q: S-H-U-L-E-M? 

 

A: No,L-I-M,Shulim. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: Because with the ﬁeﬂ it would have been Shul
em.  No, Shul im. This is how you would read 
Shulim? 
 

Q: Ye s, this is right.  He was born in Kolbuszowa? 

 

A: Kolbuszowa. 

 

Q: Someday I™ll pronounce that right. A
nd, okay so this was Leibush™s son? 
 

A: This was Leibush™s, Leibush™s oldest son. 

 

Q: How ma ny c hildren were there in Leibush™s family? 

 

A: He had, well the first one was born and he died
 after a week.  So, three children, Shulim was the 
oldest, you want the children™s  names? 
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: All right, the second one™s name  was Shlomo, 
he was born September the twentieth, ™31. And 
then was the daughter Raisa, how do you say?  {Rose.}We ll, Rosa; she was born February 15, 

1933.  See, because I don™t know if you™ll use this
, but I have pictur es, so I will gi ve you the 
pictures.  So this was from the next batch. 
 

Q: And Leibush, he at this time ow
ned his own sales general store? 

 

A: Leibush, he owned the same  store as my father
, I mean the same  kind, wh
olesale general store. 
 
Q: I reme mber you saying Leibush was a big fellow?  

 

A: We ll, he was not so big.  In Kolbuszowa 
he was considered big, but he was known -- everybody 
is known for some thing and he was known for his strength.  He was the strongest ma n, if 

some body wanted to give an example he strong, so th
ey said he™s  as strong as Leibush.  So he 
was very well known, not that he used his strength for some  fight or some thing, but he was 

known as the strongest ma n in our town. 
 

Q: Is this some thing Shulim would have been proud of? 

 

A: Ye s, I was very proud of it, because nobody woul
d start up with me  but he never got involved, 
but he was, I was always be proud. And also 
when Jews never stood up against anything what 
was done to them, Leibush was one, he wouldn™t ta
ke abuse. And there was one I write in the 

other book, once there was a draft commission, you 
know a draft commis sion came to our town 
to take the boys who had to go to draft, so they came  a fe w high Polish offi cers and a military 

doctor, and they conducted the draft.  So on
ce when Jews had to go to ______ to the bigger 
town, they went by wagon, they went by autobus. 
 The autobus went once a day, eight in the 
morning to _______ so when the Jewish people, 
some  Jewis h people wanted to go on the 
autobus, so those officers were standing by the door
, they didn™t  let in Jews and Leibush --.  I 
can, stop it––where were we? 
 

Q: We  were talking a little bit about Leibush. 

 

A: Okay, he had the store.  I started to tell you a
bout-----so those two offi
cers, the three officers 
were standi ng in the doorway they didn™t let in nobody, no Jews because they wanted to go to 

the big town. And there came also was st
anding a young woma n and she  had a sheitl a wig, 

because they were very religious, so when she wa
nted to go in they grabbe d her by the hair and 
they pulled down the wig, she was very embarra
ssed because  they were shamed. When my 
brother saw that they don™t let 
her in, they pulled off the wig, and he was this time , I would say 
about twenty years old, or twenty-one years old.
  But he went and he wanted to go and he 
pushed the officer, and it was a high officer, he pu
shed him so fast, he was standing there, that 

he fell on the other one and the 
other one, they all, three or 
four, they all fell down. And 
naturally he was afraid, so he run away, then 
the police came and they arrested my brother and 
there was a big case and they t
ook about four, five years. This was taken to J_________ to a 
superior  cour t and they made a big issue because
 who would touch a Polish officer? The ma in 
thing, after he knocked them down a ll the Jews 
went in that car, but they had my brother 
arrest ed. But the ma in thing was that they as
ked the woma n to be a witness who was pulled 

down the wig, and she didn™t want to be a witness, 
she was afraid.  But then later we had to hire 
big lawyers and it cost money and 
this was, but he was known about
 his strength. When he was 
younger, I wa s a very poor eater so my mother 
used to say ﬁI never had trouble with Le ibush, 
because Leibush, when put down for breakfast  
a bread, he finished the whole bread.  He 
finished the whole loaf.ﬂ  So they ask Lei
bush, they ask him, ﬁ When do you know that you have 

enough?ﬂ  He was not fat, when do you know it™s enough
?ﬂ  So he said, he never said when he™s  
full or some thing, {when the muscles} 
not the muscles, how you call this? 
 

Q: Jaw? 

 

A: The jaw. When the jaw starts to hurt you, 
then he knows he has enough. And there were other 
cases that, the peasant people they always wanted
 to show off their strength and there was one, 
he was known as strong.  So he came over once and 
said ﬁLet™s  wrestle.ﬂ   My brother said I 
don™t want to wrestle, I™m not a wrestler.  He said
 ﬁLet™s  wrestle.ﬂ He wanted to show he is 
stronger, so my brother didn™t want
 to bother, and later he bothered
 him a nd he said ﬁOkay, let™s 
wrestle.ﬂ  So they took off  their jacket, the 
other guy took off his jacket
.  It took a second, the 
other one wa s stretched out.  So then he said th
at he approved he™s  the strongest. And then he 
was with me  in the woods after a year and we escaped from the camp.  But  in the end he died of 
a heart attack, actually he had cancer in his mout
h and then they gave him so much cortisone 
that, awful big dose, that he went for a visit to 
Israel and while he was on the visit to Israel he 
died and the dead was a heart attack, but this 
was caused by the cortisone.  So this is about 
Leibush.  Now, about Shulim, now you have written down here, I don™t know, you have the 

record–.. 
 

Q: I have the copy back in my office. 

 

A: Shulim, here is not pronounced right, it™s 
not __________ theA is not important. All right, so 
this you have corrected.  Now, you want me  to r
ead this over and corr
ect it what is here? 
 

Q: We ll, let™s see. 

 

A: Let™s see what is important, what™s not important. Now this was written on the ID, let™s see what 
we can correct.   He™s  a very beautiful
 boy, my nephew, I don™t see that this uh–.. 
 

Q: Yeah, I think we™re not going to use that 
voice. You know, it™s going to be written. 
 
A: Hi m.  Right, so he cannot say I™m a very b
eautiful boy.  He is three years old, his parents 
dressed him in a player ™s show, cut his hair for 
the first time  and brought him to the teacher at 
the religious school, at the cheder.  His father 
can hardly wait for the day when Shulim will 
begin his public school education.  I think 
this is very–..it™s not the right language. 
 
Q: Okay. 

 

A: So they can get better langua
ge, ™39 the Germans have taken over our town, Shulim nine years 
old, knows that he no longer goes to school because all the Jewish schools have been shut 

down.  He didn™t have no Jewish schools, th
is was public schools and Jews couldn™t attend 
public schools anymore, not that the Jewish sc
hools were shut down. And he cannot walk on 
the sidewalks, this was not right in the beginni
ng, Jews could walk on the sidewalks, but this 
was not the main thing because he is a Jew.  
But he doesn™t  understand what lies behind these 
rules because I think the whole thing is, he coul
dn™t  go to school because  Je wish schools were 

shut down; all schools were shut down.  In 
1944 Shulim turned twelve in 1942 the Germans 

were, we can say we were at this 
time in the ghetto in Kolbuszowa. 
 

Q: In™42?  

 

A: In ™42, because the ghetto was established in 
July ™41. The Germans 
law was that all Jews 
twelve years and up had to wear the yellow ar
mband. We  didn™t have a yellow armband. The 
white with the blue St ar of David.  Had to w
ear the white and blue armband, there was nothing, 
and register for work. This is
 okay, we had to register from
 12 to 60.  Getting the band was 

such a proud mo ment for  Shulim, to him it mean
t he was now a ma n, that he was growing up to 
be like his father. He never realized that it was pa
rt of the Nazi, I don™t us
e the word Nazi, as the 
Germans plan to kill the Jews.  I don™t who th
e Nazis, Shulim and Germa n, ma ybe we can say 
the picture, because we™ll take out _______, the pict
ur e that he asked me , or he can say I asked 
my uncle to ma ke a picture  and I have
 a picture the day he put on the armband. 
 
Q: I know that picture. 

 

A: The picture, and when he shows off the band, 
because he was so proud of it so ma ybe this can 
be incorpor ated. 
 

Q: So he asked you? 

 

A: Ye s, he bothered me . 

 

Q: Uncle Naftali, can you ma ke a picture of me  with the–.? 

 

A: Yeah. Then I ma de the picture and I took th
e other children also and he showed the band. 
 

Q 

; He put it on the other arm?  

 

A: We ll, no he had it on the right ar
m.  He had it on the right arm, but he pulls out the arm to show 
the picture; he was so proud of it.  Shulim was tr
ansported with his mother, brother and sister to 
Belges death camp where he was killed in July 1942. Now, s hould we–.. 
 
Q: July19? 
 

A: No, July, I don™t know the date. 

 

Q: Just July, 1942. 

 

A: July, 1942 because I don™t  know because they we re kept  in the trains, but in July he  was killed.  
Now I don™t know if we should write anymore about hi
s father, that his father survived, or just 
to let it go. 
 

Q: Probably just let it go. 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: What else do you reme mber about Shulim as a child? 

 

A: Well I remember–. 

 

Q: Did he like certain things? 

 

A: He was a very good- looking boy, he was real
ly very -- and he was a very good student, when 
he started to go to school.  Because after all he
 went already three years in public school was 
from six to nine, and he 
was a very, very good student. 

 
Q: So he went to public
 school and also to–..? 
 

A: Ye s, he went to public school and after public sc
hool he went to cheder
, to a Jewish school, like 
everybody else.  From eight to twelve or one, we
 went to public school. Then in the afternoon, 
from two on, I think we went to cheder. And 
when the war broke out there was nothing left 
anymore, what else, there is nothing. 
 

Q: Did he ever help on the work detail? 

 

A: We ll, when he started, when he was twelve 
years old, he was sent out
 like everybody else, work 
details.  It was arranged by th
e Judenrat, by the Jewish Council for the Germans to come and 
grab people from the streets, th
eir houses, so it was arranged how ma ny was in the work force 
from the ghetto, so everybody got a card that this 
and this day he has to report to work.They 
worked, they sent them out, since he became 12, 
he worked, came out two or three times a week 
to go to work, in the winter mostly by snow a
nd the summer on the roads and other things. And 

we lived together because in the ghetto we moved in the apartment where Leibush lived; so 

happens that this apartment was in the place where 
the part of the ghetto was at. And we got the 
room and we worked together, we lived togeth
er.  He wasn™t , it wasn™t  so bad because my 
brother he was a me mber  of the Judenrat, th
e first Judenrat and he was selected by the 
________ about which we will talk la
ter and then later he wa s arrested but, in the book it™s 
written how he was released because  only three Je
ws were released from jail, the rest  were 
killed, the whole Judenrat.  Leibush™s father is 
still in the ghetto, he had his store because this 
was the place that he was not thrown out.  S
o, how much he could buy 
and ma rket things and 
this way he was not bad off in the ghetto. They ha d enough, everythi ng.  Until it was the 

transport to J_________ and J_________to Belges
 and then they were killed. 
 

Q: So they lived in an apartment, that™s what they had? 

 

A: We ll, they ha d an apartment, the apartment wa
s of two large rooms and a  large kitchen, so when 
we moved into the ghetto we took over the larg
e kitchen, I say we, I me a n my father, my 
mother, and I and two sisters.  So we had the 
kitchen, and he with hi
s three children had the 
bedroom, so we lived together what we used the 
same  kitchen and they had this one room.  But 

he also had, in the basement, he had the stor
e still, there was not too much me rchandise, but 

how much he could buy from black ma rketeeers, so he had, and he was busy in the store. 
 

Q: So he lived above the store? 

 

A: He lived above the baseme nt, yeah, and we lived in the same –..and he was lucky in this time 
that his apartment, his store was in the ghetto. Li
ke for us, they threw us out from our  house and 
to go into the ghetto, but he was th
ere, so we came  to live with him.  Now, if we wouldn™t live 

from hi m there would be other people, but this 
way when we took it over, so nobody else came  
in the house.  But the ma in thing is from Shu
lim, also here you have written down 1945, Shulim 
was born the same  year as Richard, my older br
other ™s son, but Richard was born inAmerica.  
My brother had moved t here afte
r a pogrom in our town in 1919. 
 I always think of these two, 
Richard now a doctor inAmerica, Shulim killed 
in Poland at 13, not 13 but 12.  See the people 
are so stupid, they know by he was born in 1930 a
nd he was killed in 1942, but here they ma rk 
down 13.  So he was born when he was 12 years ol
d.  So this, I think, this is a very nice 

sentence, that to compare those two, Richard no
w a doctor inAmerica and Shulim killed in 

Poland at the age of twelve.  So, what you can 
wr ite too much, but I think what you have is 
enough ma t e rial. 
 
Q: Anything distinguishing about 
his mother that you reme mber ? 
 

A: We ll, his mo ther was a housewife and she took 
care of -- nothing distinguished.  She took care 
on the house and Leibush took care on the store, 
but nothing special.  But ma ybe to mark down 

that Leibush survived the war.  
That Leibush survived the war with me  in the woods and died in 
America in 1960.  Okay, now we have this, we ha
ve this and they will be the same  kind of 
passports, the new ones? 
 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: Well that is a very nice format, it looks very
 good. The only thing it should be correct. 
 

Q: Exactly. 

 

A: No who do we go now?  To_______________ 

 

Q: Yeah, that would be very interesting to do. 

 

A: Passports come  out, send the corrected passports 
this way.  I want to keep it, I have alwa ys 
collections I would like.  Now Na ftali you went 
over mi ne, so we don™t have to add anything on 
mi n e .  
 

Q: No,no. 
 
A: Now, what you want Dr.Anderman.  His name  was LeonAnderman. 

 

Q: A-N-D-E-R-M-A-N? 

 

A: A-N-D-E-R-M-A-N, yeah.  LeonAnderman, he
 came to Kolbuszowa from uh, it came out the 
book, All Physicians in Poland and he was a me ntion 
to that I dated back to my nephe w but that 
was written the year when he was born, the date. Anyway, he came to Kolbuszowa in the early 

20™s and he -- well not in the 20™s mark down in th
e 20™s, I don™t know if th
e early twenties.  So 
cross off the early twenties.  He became  the phys ic
ian of Kolbuszowa. There were in this time , 
there were two doctors in Kolbuszowa; it was th
e county doctor, the official doctor which we 
called the physic, and then there it was this priv
ate doctor.  Mostly Jews used him, he was 
very–.. 
 

Q: UsedDr.Anderman? 

 

A: Dr.Anderman, yeah.  He was a very assimilate
d Jew, he didn™t have a
nything to do with the 
Jewish causes, he never stepped 
in the synagogue, and so was hi
s wife. They had one son, he 
was about two years younger than 
I was; his name  was Jurek, J-U-
R-E-K.  He was -- he never 
attended a cheder, or to a Jewish school. His wi
fe had never any contac
t with Jewish wome n. 
He was very respected by the Polish community as 
he was an officer in the Polish army, in the 
reserve army, he was also an officer yet in theAustrian army. 
 

Q: Where was he from originally? 
 

A: He was originally from a town nearTa rnople, 
this is near St anislovov this is near the Russian 
border, there was a few brothers he was originally
 from there.  He started me dicine inVi enna, 
because this belonged to ---. Too bad I don™t 
have the book because in the book it™s written 
exactly the date when he was born, when he graduated. 
 

Q: Is it a ﬁWho™sWhoﬂ of ---? 

 

A: Only doctors, a book about physicians in Poland. 

 

Q: Ohreally? 

 

A: Who died, who were killed.  It™s  a thick book, 
if you want to know I ca n find out exactly, you 
want to know about this, is it important? 
 

Q: Yeah, I™d like to try to get his birth date. 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: I ma y even be able to find this book at the Li brary of Congress. 

 

A: It™s book, he has it, so I™ll give
 it to you.  Give Kevi
n the information, I™ll tell him to ma ke a 
copy–..informa tion of Dr.Ander man.  It™s also, cer
tain things is not correct also.  Somebody 
who wrote it didn™t know. We ll, anyway he, said
 he never bothered with Jewish causes when 
the first time  when they threw out the Jews
 from Germany in __________ this was the first time  
that he came. They organized a committee in ev
ery little town to help the German Jews who 
were thrown out  and we  organized in Kolbuszowa 
also and this is the first time he took part for 
it. And I reme mber the first time that he attend
ed shul when he spoke about giving money to 
this organization to help.The 
second time I reme mber he came to shul to speak that when 
before the war started and the Polish governme nt 
saw t hat there have to be a war, so they 
wanted the citizens should donate money to b
uy airplanes because the Polish air force di dn™t 
have too ma ny airplanes; they had a few.  So, they
 collected money so I re
me mber he, this is the 
second time  he came to shul, he spoke to the Jews
, naturally he spoke Polish.  Spoke to the Jews 
willing to gi ve money, and I reme mber his wo
rds, he said, ﬁToday we beg you to give the 
money, but in a few months, I am afraid they will
 take it without.ﬂ  He meant the Germans, they 
would take it without begging you, without aski
ng you.  He asked the people for money, and 
then this was the fi rst two times, when the war started he was drafted as a reservist, as a doctor 

to the army.  He was take n to a pr isoners™ camp in an officers™ prisoner of war camp. And then 

later he was released, short after he was released and see, in this book was written exactly 

where he was interned. 
 

Q: This was after the German invasi on? 

 

A: After the German invasion, he was in the army, 
they drafted him,  they drafted all the doctors  
and he was a reserve officer, being a doctor so th
ey drafted him.  And t hen he was taken as a 
prisoner of war, and he came back to Kolbuszo
wa he started to run his office. When the  
Germans ordered the Jews should ma ke a Judenrat
, that means a Jewish 
council, and there was 
one Jew who right away volunteered. As the Germ
ans came in he started to be an important 

man by the Germans, he started to co me to the co
mmandant and he started to tell them all kinds 
of stories.  He was not a very person, this–.. he
 started to tell them 
which Jews have hidden 
me rchandise, as a ma tter of fact my father suffered
 very much from this Jew.  Like he came to 
my -- the Germans liked ________ coffee, coffe e beans.  He came to my -- and we had coffee  

beans hidden so he came every day for coffee bean
s. Today he wanted two kilo, the next day 
three kilo and then four
 kilo–.and then my fat her told hi
m how much can I give you, I me an 
we don™t have new shipme nts.  He said to him a we
ll, if you take so much
 water out it will be 
dry.  So he said well if
 you don™t want to give mo
re I will take it, so he
 went to the Germans and 
he squealed that my father has hidden me
rchandise. They came over and they took away 
everything we had.  I reme mber it 
was three days that they went
 and loaded everything we had 
because he squealed. 
 

Q: Not just coffee, everyt hing? 

 

A: Everything, they took everythi ng, they took ev
en personal things, everyt hi ng because they said 
that he ---. They took away everything, we ha
d a lot of merchandise be
cause this merchandise 
could be sold and we could have mo ney, but th
ey took away everything.  My father ran away, 
and then because he was afraid that  they will arre
st him, I run away and this time  I run away to 
Russia, which later I came  back. And he, and th
is man wanted to become  the president because 
the Germans said you have to orga
nize a Jewish council, 
but the Jews knew if
 he would become  
council, it would be very bad for the Jews b
ecause he was, like I said.  Before the war  
everybody knew some body wanted to have a witness in
 court, if there was a court case and they 
needed a witness, he would always be a witness fo
r money, naturally.  So even there was here in 
America there are sayi ngs if I speak to some people from Kolbuszowa and I ask them 

something and they don™t want to tell me a  lie, so they said, what do you think, I am this and 

this?  I don™t want to me ntion his na me  because he ha s hi s fa mily.  So they say, what do you 
think I am him?   He wa s known that he is Œ for 
money he can be a witness.  So then we Jews  
knew that if he would become  the president 
it would be bad for Jews because he would 
collaborate with the Germans.  So the Jews st
arted to speak to prominent Polish Catholics, 
especially to the ma yor, who we told him that we
 are very concerned that he would become  the 
president, not only this, because if he will be 
president he will pick out me mbers, his friends, 
his like, and then it will be bad. We  the Jews, I say we, I say the Jews themselves, say the only 
one who could actually be strong
er than him is Dr.Anderman, he
 didn™t look Jewish, I me an he 
didn™t have a beard, mo st of the Jews had bear
ds and he spoke beautiful German because he 
started inVienna and he was a pr
oud ma n and he would never -- he
 would be able 
to protect the 
Jews. A group of J e wish people went to
 hi m and they said to him he should 
become __________ so he said, I was never involved with Jewish things, I am a doctor.  I don™t 

want to be a politician, and I don™t want to have a 
job like this. The Jews begged him, they told 
him, look if you don™t do it, you are the only one, can
 protect us from this ma n and he knew that 
this ma n is no good for the Jews. We ll, anyway, after a few times. I reme mber my father went 

to him and others, he said al l right, I will do 
it against my judgment, I will do it, only on one 
condition.  If I will -- he had to pick out ten or tw
elve me mbers of the council, -- only if I can 
pick out the people I wa nt.  So, he ma de the 
list and he picked out mostly younger people, 
mostly people without beards, a
nd that shouldn™t be, again, the Germans shouldn™t dislike them 
and also, people who we re in the 
Jewish community leaders before 
the war. They were people,  
respected citizens, and people w
ho were quite well off and he pi
cked out this Jewi sh council 
which included my brot her Leibush, and my
 brother-in-law Sh_____, well younger people. He 
organized the Jewish council whic
h was a blessing for Kolbuszowa because before the Germans 
used to grab people from the streets from thei
r houses for work.  He or
ganized and made lists, 

and everything that had to be done was done t h
rough the organization.  If you want more  
details, in the book I have more details aboutAnderman. 
 
Q: So around July ™41 he became the head of the Judenrat? 

 

A: No, no.  He became head of the Judenrat in, be
fore the ghetto, he became head of the Judenrat 
in the mi ddle of ™40.  In the mi ddle of ™40, ev
en earlier, I would say in spring of ™40, spring 
1940, yeah. And then he ran the Judenrat and it was run very -- he was very just, and if they 

had to take money because they needed for certa
in things, he always took it from people that 
had money.  If you want a few details you read 
the book about this chapte
r,  you™ll see he was a 
very fair man, and I liked him very much.  La
ter he  opened an ambulator ium, a free clinic 
because he was a doctor and he knew a lot of 
people don™t have mone y, so my  sister and the 
brother- in-law who was also a me mber of the J
udenrat, had the empty st ore because he was in 
the flower business, and in the war they didn™t have flower, so he opened in his store the 

ambulatorium.  He was there two or three ti
me s a week in the afte
rnoon, and everybody who 
was sick, especially the poorer pe
ople came there and he treated them without fee.  He needed 
help so he asked me  with other friend of mi ne
, a nd he became  -- we worked and he started to 
teach me  how to dress wounds and how to clean 
boils and all these things and I was very good 

as I always wanted to be a docto
r, I was very good at it.  I went
 ther e and for this, because I was 
with him, this work released me  from going to
 work on the roads or some thing and I worked 
with him for over a year in this ambulatorium. 
 

Q: When did that open? That ambulatorium?  

 

A: This ambula t orium opened in the mi ddle of ™
40, yeah, I would say in the summer of 1940. And 
I worked with him with my friend, we––..Then la
ter mor e  and more, I was more skilled, so a 
lot of things I could do, special with w
ounds and dressings and all those things. 
 

Q: You saw Poles and Jews there? 

 

A: No, no only Jews.  No Poles, th
ey had their doctors there, he wasn™t  allowed to treat Poles;  the 
Germans forbid a Jewish doctor to
 treat Poles. Then also he 
gave me  a job, before the war I 
was the buyer for my father ™s stor e and I used to
 go to different towns. They needed somebody 
to bring in the flour and other f
ood what Germans gave on carts to
 the Jews, and this had to be, 
we had to bring it from Jeshup, from other towns.
 Also we  had to buy 
a lot of stuff from the  
black ma rket, like potatoes, they didn™t  give 
us enough, other things that
 we needed we opened 
a public kitchen, a soup kitchen in -- he organi
zed a soup kitchen.The kitchen needed certain 
things that the Germans didn™t give us, so I -- th
ey picked me up and I went out twice a week to 
different towns.  I got a pass and I could go ou
t and I could travel, an
d I brought in all those  
things that the Jewish co mmunity
 got officially from the Germans. By going out and having this 
pass, I  also could buy a lot of black ma rket fo
r the Jewish -- for the soup kitchen we needed, 
and also I bought on the black ma rket for mys e lf
, for my fa mily.  I brought in stuff and they 
sold it so they could ma ke some thing out of it,
 my fa ther.  So this was how we worked with 
Anderman and I became very, very friendly with
Ander man and I admi r e d him because he was 
very fair. There was some thing, a question about 
having privileges, the 
people who were in the 
Jewish council, they wanted to take advantage, 
he always was against it. Again in his book, you 
have the stories about it. Then they organized the ghetto, they organized the ghetto so he was  

responsible for the Jewish should ha ve where to 
live.  He built a house a year before the war, 
and this was the most exclusive, the most beau
tiful house in Kolbuszowa
 very ---.  It was a 

modern house, this was the only house what 
had electricity and was the only house who had 
indoor plumbing. You see, he had a, not compre
ssor, what you call it, to ma ke electricity. 
 
Q: Agenerator? 

 

A: He had a generator and the ge
nerator produced enough el
ectricity to take care on the toilets, 
with the water.   It was a beautiful house, 
it had nice furniture, so this _________ the head of 
the county, the Ger man who was ver y vicious, 
his na me  wasTwardon. AndTwardon wanted to 
take over his house for himself because it was in a nice section.  So he urgedAnderman to take 

over an apartment in the ghetto, in
 the place where the 
ghetto is.  He said to him,  you take, 
because you are the head of the Jude nrat, pick 
out the best apartment for yourself. Anderman 
said I will not pick out an apartment until the last Jew has a roof over his head. And if the Jews 

will be settled, then I will take it.  See, he wanted
 to move in his apar tment, then later said to 
him, I want to move in the apartment but he
 wanted a Jews should 
give him 10,000 zloty to 
renovate the apartment.  He said renovate it, it™s
 just a new house, it™s  just a year old. And 

besides, why do you have to renovate, you wouldn™
t live long in this house, the war will end 
and I will go back to the house. 
See, he didn™t lik
e these answers. 
 

Q: That™s a very bold thing to say. 

 

A: Yes, yes, well he didn™t like these answers, so on a certain day this wa
s about, I would say about 
two weeks after the ghetto was 
established,Twardon came and he arrested the whole Judenrat, 
everybody in the Judenrat.  Besides the Judenrat 
he also arrested about ten more people, and 
naturally for the town it was a very big shock th
ey arrested, butAnderma n was free.  Everybody 
saidAnderman he™s the father of us and he will try to go out and try to see that they should be 

released.  He  went and spoke to thisTwardon so tw
o days later, or a day 
later he was arrested. 
Once he was arrested we  felt th
at the situation was very grave 
because he was the only one who 
could --. They were in jail in
 Kolbuszowa about two weeks. 
 

Q: So the whole Judenrat except him was arrested first? 

 

A: First, yes, and then later he was arrested, two 
days later.  So, he -- now
 my brother was arrested, 
my brother-in-law wasn™t  arrested, because my
 brother- in-law, I™m writing also in the book, 
there was before the ghetto was established they 
took a certain a mount of Jews from t he ma rket 
place and they sent them away to
 have less Jews by us.  He wasn™t
 there, so they didn™t arrest  
him. Later though he came  back, we  paid money,
 he came back, so there was no Judenrat.  Now 
we were alone so naturally the police started to 
come  in and the police started to ma ke orders 
but then he said he™s looking for a new head of 
the Judenrat. While they were sitting in jail, 

they were also sitting two brothers, their 
name  was Rappaport,Ya nchi Rappaport and Pashi 
Rappaport and they were Jews without beards, 
they were young, they were educated Jews. 
They had their business before the war that they 
used to send pigs to Katervitz it™s a big town 
near the German border, this was th
eir business, soAnderman said–. 
 

Q: Pigs they sent? 

 

A: Yeah, this was their business.They bought pigs, 
they sent them out, they slaughtered them, the y  
sent the meat to this town and they had this 
business.  It was a very
 unusual business for Jews 
but they were not observant Jews, so this iswhat they did. Anderman knew -- we knew that  

Twardon™s looking for a new ________ but he wants to 
have someone with authority, so even in 

jail, because in jail they lived 
in one big baseme nt, it was not li
ke a regular jail, but they kept 
them in the baseme nt from the ma gistrate build
ing.  SoAnderman said that if he would ask 
some body t o become ________ the president of Judenr
at everybody should refuse. This way if 
everyone would refuse and to say that they cannot
 take care on this onlyAnder man can. This 
maybe will force them to let outAnderman.  Me
anwhile this Rappaport who was there he didn™t 
listen to him and he told his wife to go toTw
ardon and tell him that he
r husband, this Pashik 
Rappaport is willing to become  Judenrat. That
 he™s young, he™s energetic, he™s good looking 
and the German would like him, and he speak
s good German and they 
have a business in 
K________.  He looked at her, she was a good looki
ng woman and one day the police came and 
they took out this Pashik and they saw that he 
--. They take him away to the office where the 
____ so right away Jews started to suspect bu
t he said oh nobody will become  the ald____. 
Anyway he spoke toTwardon and he toldTwar
don he would be a good Judenrat ma n and he  
will serve the Germans and all these things and he released him and his brother fr om jail, and he 

ma de the president and his brothe
r the assi stant.  Once this 
happened,Anderman said now we  
have lost everything. We  didn™t believe that a Je
w would do it but he did and this man started to 
pick out me mbers of the Judenrat.  Naturally 
he pi cked out differen
t kinds of people that  
Anderman wanted.Anderman wanted the best qua
lity and he picked out from the people that  
they were servant.  He was in the cattle busines
s so he took a few people who were in the cattle 
business and a few black marketers.  He made a 
new Judenrat.  Now the ne
w Judenrat started to 
work and then the Polish population wanted to 
take awayAnderman. Anderman could go out 
because, as a ma tter of fact, pract
ically every night he went out to sleep in some  Polish house. 
This was wa tched, this jail wa
s watched by the municipal police.
 They knew him so they let 
him out and the next day before dawn he came  
back. The Polish people begged him not to go 
back.  Eventually they would do something with t
hose people, they will not keep them forever.  
He didn™t listen; he said that the Jews cannot 
take care.  I am the one who can speak to the 
Germans for them; they listen to me.  He didn™t 
run away and then one day they came  and they 
took all of them away to J______.
 They let out only three Je
ws, they let out, my brother 
included.  If you read the book you will know the reason why.  My brot her-in-law came  back 

from J____ soTwardon said that there are some me
mbers of the first Judenrat, they should take 

them in. They became in the second Judenrat.  
They were in J____ about 
two weeks. After two 
weeks they took all of them toAus c hwitz and 
this time Auschwitz was not so prominent as  
later. They took them toAuschwitz and as th
ey took them t oAuschwitz, the families start to 
receive telegrams. They said this one diedfrom cancer, this one died on pneumonia, this one 

died trying to escape. 
 

 Let me flip the tape. 

           END OF SIDEA,TAPE 1 

 

Q: Ve ry good, yeah. 

 

A: Must be -- because I bought 
one, it™s not very good.All right 
so there came the telegrams and 
always the telegrams had some thing to say. Th
ey had to sign, some bod
y died, let™s say on lung 
cancer. Wh y they had to sign that he suffered 
from lung cancer a long time . Why they did it, 
why they make so evident a ----
--; somebody died on some other sic
kness, that he suffered from 
it. Then a week after they r
eceived the telegrams and you coul
d see the postman came in went  
into a house, that right away you 
could hear the crying 
and the screaming so we knew that he 
comes with a telegr am. About two weeks later, the same people 
received bills fromAuschwitz 

with bills to pay for the cremati
on with some ashes.They had to pay for the cr emation. This is 
howAnderman was gone.  Meanwhile when he wa
s arrested, his wife and son were left in 

Kolbuszowa with non-Jewish friends. They we
nt toWa rsaw and they lived thisAryan as 
Catholics inWa rsaw.  His wife survived but the son was an officer in the Polish underground 
when it was theWarsaw uprising.  Not theWars
aw uprising but the Jews 
of the generalWa rsaw 
uprising, he  was killed in the uprising.  His wife
 survived and after a while she came  over here 

an old broken woma n. She died here inAmerica.
  ForAnderman, when he was arrested so the 
Polish people, even the ma yor who was in _____ 
went toV_______ and told them he should be 
released if he says the Polish patriot and he is 
such an honest ma n.  He
 says this is why we 
arrested him, he was too honest.  I 
think that thisAnderman t hat wh
at he did for the Jews that he 
never, never associated with the Je ws, that he  wa
s an exceptional ma n.  I always say if the Jews 
would ever have saints like th
e Catholics have saints,Anderman should have been a saint. 

Because he could have survived, he had a possib
ility; he had help from the Polish people, he 
was considered to be a Polish Catholic.  He said ,No, I cannot do it, I have to stay with the Jews  

because the Germans listen to me and they respect me. 
 

Q: Do you think he just went a l
ittle too far with the Germans?  
 

A: He went a little too far. 

 

Q: He was a little too resistant? 

 

A: We ll, he tried because he  saw that they respecte
d him so certai n time s he went a little too far. 
He was not a person that we call it like a Jew-
boy.  He  always had his pride and for the 
Germans, he was not good.  If you read the 
book, you will see a lot of things that I ga ve 
examples of what he did. It wa
s a little too much so he died. 
 

Q: When you were part of the Polish army you we
re able to go toAuschwitz and you found those 
photos ofAnderman? 
 

A: Yeah, well I didn™t found it in this
 time . Later, a few years later,
 usually --.  No, the photos of 
Anderman I had because I save th
em. This is one photo, I think from the thirties and one what I  
had when he built the new house was few years, a year before the war. 
 

Q: Sitting outside the house? 

 

A: Sitting outside the house, I have it. Then I 
got a photo of his son.  Hi
s wife gave me the photo 
when she was here.  Now his photos fromAuschwitz, now usually the Germans di dn™t ma ke  

mug shots from prisoners. They had millions and millions, I don™t know what they di d,______. 

Now the pe ople who were selected to be, to 
go the gas chambers. As  you know, about 85% 

right away went to the gas ch
ambers; about 15% they went 
to the camp. So the people who 
went to the gas chambers didn™t get the tattoos.   
Only the people who went to the right or to the 
left  like they had the selection.  But very
 few,Anderman naturally was not -- all the 
Kolbuszowa were not gassed right away. This time, there were no transports toAuschwitz. 

This was a camp where they took mo stly Polish people were in the underground or were in the 

black ma rket. Jews who were called for one reason 
or another, like the Judenrat.  So they didn™t 
have selections; they were in the camp, some  a 
week, some, some were tw
o weeks.  Because he 
was doctor, and because he was an important person, 
they made him mu g shots. This is the first 
time I saw that somebody got out. The mug shots th
at I got out about ten 
years later, about ten 

years fromAnderman. They keptAnderman, fo
r this I have the number and the triangles 
because they have two kinds of triangles.  Jews have always had triangles, if he was a criminal  

or political , the Jews usually had two. They ha
d political and Jews so the triangle made like a 
myogen Da vid. So one was a red one which was a 
certain other transgressions and the other one 
was the yellow, the yellow was for Jews. 
 So I got later fromAuschwitz.    
 
Q: What was his, do you know? What triangles
 did he have?   Do you know the colors? 
 

A: Usually Jews had red and blue.  One was political and one was Jewish. On this, it™s black and 
one, so I don™t know.  But this is probably what Jews had. 
 

Q: Once he was deported, you ne
ver heard from hi m again? 
 

A: Once he was taken to Czechowi
ce.  He was in Czechowice about 
two weeks. When he was in 
Czechowice together with the othe
r people fr om Kolbuszowa; this time they arrested not only in 
Kolbuszowa they arrested in other towns fr
om the section where Czechowice was the head 

town. We used to come to one place every week
 with packages for them because there was one 
of the guards that he could be bribed. We  
ga ve him money and he took the packages with 
letters for them.  If they arrived, I don™t know. Because I had a pass to go out from the ghetto, I 

told you I went two, three times to buy, to bri
ng the stuff, so I was the one who brought over the 
packages.We met in one place and there I met 
people from all other towns from around us. 
Everybody did the same thing. They brought th
e packages and later this German, some body 
came. They took the packages, th
ey got paid and he supposedly 
gave them the food.  But we 
never found out because he never brought back lette
rs. We send them letters.  He could take the 
money, take the food -- but so
 long as there was hope, every
body sent them. I think once they 
came in, that they brought back 
letters.  He was there about ten 
days or two weeks. After two 
weeks they send both toAuschwitz. 
 InAuschwitz, after a few w
eeks, I think after two weeks, 
the telegrams started to co me. 
 

Q: Did you know what hi
s said, his telegram?  
 

A: I don™t know because hi s telegram didn™t arri
ve because there was nobody to send a telegr am. 
 

Q: Because his wife and son had left? 

 

A: His wife disappeared. They disappeared the 
day he was arrested.  But the other people, the 
telegr ams came and I saw the telegrams.  Mostly 
the telegram says that we want  to let you 
know that your husband, this
 and this day, he died of cancer or
 he died on lung failure,TB. She 
had to sign that he suffered fromTB. Then some they were killed while trying to esca pe.  But 

this was not --. 
 

Q: You suspect he was gassed at 
Auschwitz versus being executed? 
 

A: No, they were all gassed, they were all ga
ssed.  But in the beginni
ng, we don™t know because 
this was in 1941. This was towards --. 
 

Q: They were still building the crematorium?  

 

A: They were still building it, 
so I don™t know if this were 
gas or executed, we don™t know.  I  
would suspect that there was one --. The cremat
orium was already there.  But the gas chambers 
I don™t think were there.  I never looked into it but I should have because after the war I was on 

the commis sion. There was a commission that st
udied the crimes for the Germans.  I was a  
me mber of this commission which was headed 
by Hewlett Johnson (?). He was the Dean of 
Canterbury.  {You have photos of him, don™t you No
r man? } Yes, I have photos of him. The  
Archbishop of Canterbury and he was thehead. The me mbers of this commission were 

professors of universities from all over the world. There was anAmerican, a Russian and I was 

sent from the Polish governme nt. There were tw
o delegates from the Polish government.  I was 
one and the other one was, his name  was Meega.  But his name  was not Meega, he was a lawyer 

from Cracow, his name  was Dissenfeld.  Later he 
lived in England.  He wa
s a lawyer before the 
war. 
 

Q: AJew? 

 

A: A Jew, yeah, distant.  But then he ma squera
ded as a non-Jew.  His name , he changed it to 
Meega. We  were both sent but 
we were sent as me mbers to th
is commissions, from the secret 
police.  Because they wa nted to know what cont
acts they had, this delegation. They didn™t trust 
nobody.  So this Hewlett Johns
on who was quote a ﬁRed Dean
ﬂ because he was very pro-
communis m.  He was archbishop. 
They wanted to know what 
connections he had with the 
Polish underground, with all those things. We  were 
sent and officially we were me mbers of the 
Polish delegation but our mi ssion was completely di
fferent. This Hewlett Johnson, the reason 
they called hi m the ﬁRed Deanﬂ was because when 
it was the KoreanWar, he went to Korea and 
he wrote how theAmericans behaved and what th
eAmericans are doing, ve
ry pro-communist.   
Then later I wanted to go and I we nt over to one
 commentator and wanted
 to tell him how he  
was mi sled.  How we arranged his meetings with 
the Polish peasants, with the Polish patriots so 
that everything was such offici
ally done and everything was lies.
 That the governme nt did it 
just to show him. Then later, he said to 
me , listen they won™t bother you, don™t start because 
you came over here. They will ask you how you know
 those things and --.
  So I let it go. I 
went, his last name , his name  
Barry Gray.  He was a very out
spoken commentator
, I went to 
him.  He said to me , you come  over here, you had 
so much trouble.  Don™t go into mo re trouble. 
I could find out fromAuschwitz in the beginning
 everything because I was the authority but 
there were so ma ny things. The wa r was still go
ing on that this was secondary to --.  But I 

ma de pictures inAuschwitz, I have the pictures
 still today. You don™t have all because we 
didn™t come  yet to those pictures.This is -- I 
ma de a list, the pictures that I gave you.  Is 
supposed to be 150 but actually it wa
s 153 because some  were ma deA.B.C. 
 

Q: That™s right. 

 

Q: So this isAnderman. Ta ken in --.  I have the date but I don™t know if you want to have the date  
for the pictur e, no? 
 

Q: No.  Just need their birth dated, approxima tely. 

 

Q: Birth dates I don™t know.  Let™s s
ee, if they were three and a ha
lf years old and it was ™38, ™39, 
™40, ™41. They were born in the second half of 
™38, both of them.  I don™t reme mber the dates. 
 

Q: They™re the same age? 

 

A: They™re the same age, yeah. The difference wa
s in about a month, I think.  Now she was older,  
her name  wa s Blimcha. 
 

Q: B-l-i-m- i-c-a? 
 

A: B-l-i-m- c-i-a.. You got it?   B
limcia.  Lische,  L-i-s-c-h-e.  

 

Q: Her father was Moshe? 

 

A: The father?  No.The father was Shayadovid; th
e mother was my second 
sister, Malcia, M-a-l-c-
i-a, Malcia.This was Blimcia. The other ™
s name s was Henoch, H-e-n-o-c-h, Kornfeld.You 
know how to spell Kornfeld.  His father ™s name  
was Moses, Moshe, we called him Moshe.  His  

mother ™s  name  was my third sister Lieba.  How you spell Li eba? 
 

Q:  L- i - e- b- a?L- e- i .
 I guess for Lieba. 
 

A: L-i-e-b-a.  {Just L-i, some  
people could read it Lyba.  So it™s 
better L-i-e that™s  Leeba.} So 
Lieba and my second sister, born the same . 
 Oh, you have the machine going?   good. 
 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: Now, there were, what I can tell you. They are beautiful, they were beautiful children. Will you 
ma rk down t o send me  the ma p?  
 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: Copy of ma p.  Now you can ma ke
 two, three, ma ybe I will need
 it. They were beautiful 
children, happy children, playing around like children 
did. What the question?  You want to ask 
if --? 
 

Q: Were they religious families? 

 

A: Ve ry religious, very religious. 

 

Q: Hasidic? 

 

A: Hasidic, yeah.  Like Lische who was a grands
on from a very famous dyna stic rabbi which is not 
important which one it is.  Kornfeld was a graduate of theYe shiva Hach______ Lublim. We  

spoke about it before, theYe shiva Hach_____Lublim
. We  changed there but I think --.  How 
did you ma rk down? 
 

Q: H______Ye s hiva. 

 

A: Is wrong, should beYe shiva Hach_______Lublim. You will reme mbe r, 
Ye shiva__________Lublim.  It me ans theYe shiva 
of the Smart ones of Lubli m {The wise 
me n}. The wise me n of Lublim.  M a rk dow
n that this is the 
correct for Kalman. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: You have it there?  If you ma rk down, it doesn™t  get lost? 

 

Q: No, I™m ver y good about this. 

 
A: Good, so you correct it because now it™s 
wrong there Hach___Yeshiva Lublim, it™s wrong. 
Ye shiva Hach___Lublim. So he was a graduate
 of this yeshiva and he was religious. 
 

Q; What did they do for work? 

 

A: Okay.  Lische Shadovid had a whol esale flour bu
siness.This was my fa th
er gave him over part 
of our store.When he came  in, he was never a bu
sinessman so he took a pa
rt of the store, flour, 
and he used to sell to stores and to bakeries, 
the flour. Moshe had a wholesale of textiles, mostly 
crude textile for underwear. 
 

Q: Wa s this also set up by your father? 

 

A: Ye s. All through my father, yes.  He  was al
ways -- my father bought them houses and he set 
them up in business.  Now what else would you like to know? 
 

Q: Did they have br
others and sisters? 
 

A: Ye s.  Blimcia had one sister, a year and a ha
lf younger and her name  was Dobcher, D-o-b-c-i-a. 
 

Q: One and a half years younger? 

 

A: One and a half years younger, she was killed 
when she was two.  I think two years younger. 
Henoch had a brother the same  age, one and a ha
lf years younger, his name wasYussel. Moshe, 
you know the business. They were with us toge
ther in ghetto. They lived together in one 
apartment, consisting of two rooms.  In the ghe
tto, Shadovid was a me mb er of the Judenrat and 
then later he was sent away. 
 
Q: After being arrested, he wa
s sent away withAnderman? 
 

A: No, he was not arrested because he was away. 

 

Q: He was away?  that™s  right. 

 

A: He was away; for this reason he was not arrest
ed to be sent away. Then later when he came 
back, Fathering said to accept hi
m.  Moshe worked like everyday jobs what they sent out people 
to work.  Nothing --. {Slave wo
rk}. The children pl ayed in the ghetto, they had game s like 
children game s.  But one, an exceptional game  , 
which I want you should put it in, which this is 
very important.The Henoch, he was like the ringlead
er, was very sma r t for his age. When he  
lived before we went to the ghetto, we lived not far fr om the German police. We knew the 

German commandants of the police. Everybody 
knew them.  One was good, one was bad, one 
was worse. There was one ma n, his name s was Hare
nbeer. Habier is H-a-b-
i-e-r.  He had a face 
like very, very like a bulldog.  His face was not r
eally a human face and he was ve ry vicious. 
He killed a lot of people. The children knew about it and their game i n ghetto was that this 

Henoch and Blimcia took together a few other ch
ildren.  Henoch stood in front of them and he  
spoke to them Ger man because he  heard about it.
  He us ed to ask them, he had in his hand a 
piece of wood pretendi ng this is a rifle. 
 

Q: The German he spoke wa
s just what he heard? 

 
A: What he heard, how could he speak real German.  He said Bi st Du Juden?  That me a ns are you 
a Jew? To the children.  No w this was a ga me
 and children answeredYa vol, yes that we are 
Jews.  He said, _______. Because you are a Jew, you 
are dead.  He took th
e rifle and started to 
pretend, poof, poof, one after the ot
her. After he pointed the rifle,
 he said poof, they fe ll down, 

pretendi ng they are dead. This was their ga me .  
It shows you that the tim
e the children of three 
and three and a half years had those game s.  Ev
ery time . the same  game, got together, he was 
the policeman.Yeah, also when he
 said, first introduced hims elf wh
en he got the job.  He said, 
Ich ben Habier, he didn™t know the Habier.   He said
 he heard it so he said I am Habier.  Bist Du 
Juden and this was the game.  I think because they had such beautiful children, I think a picture 

like this with this st ory --.They were sent  in
 July, 1942, they were sent with their families to 
Belzec death camps. 
 

Q: Right from - -? 

 

A: No, from Kolbuszowa, everybody was sent to C
zechowice.  But in Czechowice they were there 
about a week or two weeks. Because what they did, the gathered the people from all the small  

towns in one place. They wanted to have in one place. 
 

Q: They liquidated your ghetto? 

 

A: They liquidated mi ne. Then once they had them 
in Czechowice, then they ma de big transports. 
They made five transpor ts. With the first trans
port, I have the date, they were sent to Belzec, 
this was July 7. They were sent to Belzec, t
ogether, in this day they send out 12,000 Jews.  Six 
were killed in a nearby forest 
by Glowkoff G-l-o-w------ We ll, 
I described this
 in the book. 
They sent 6,000 elderly were killed in prepared
 ditches and the rest we
re sent to Belzec. 
 

Q: So, 6,000 were killed at Glow
koff and another 6,000 deported? 
 

A: Deported to Belzec, yes.  But at this time --. 

 

Q: And they were de
ported, these children? 
 

A: Together with -- yeah.  Because only elderly and 
crippl ed were killed in Gl owkoff.  In this time, 
they were so busy with the transport in July that
 they had to wait sometimes three, four days in 
the cattle cars till it was pr ocessed this arri val.  Sometimes they waited two, three days.  
 

Q: Once at Belzec, they would sit? 

 

A: They would sit there on the ra
ilroa d trac ks. A lot of times this was in the summer, there were 
ten carloads.There were French cars, cattle cars a
nd they were ma de out of heavy tin. The heat 
without water; some times they 
opened the doors, half of them 
were dead. They had to wait 
someti mes two, three days till there was place to pr
ocess them in, to take them down to undress 
and to gas them and the n later to cremate them
. Well, actually in the 
beginning, they were not 
cremated. There were ditches which they filled the ditche s, this was near the Russian border, so 

there were ditches made, anti-ta
nk ditches.  I have a complete description because when I went 

there, I arrest ed one
 of the engineers. 
 

Q: Do you remember like what co
lor hair and eyes they had? 

 
A: Oh, yes, sure.  Blimcia, she looked like an ange
l.  She had light blonde curly hair, all curls. Her 
eyes were watery blue. You know some ti me
s some body has blue and they are like watered 
down, very, very bright, light bl ue. And always 
had a face, she was chubby, had a face always 

smiled.  Like she smiles in this picture.  Now 
Henoch, his hair was darker
.  It was a dark blond 
hair and dark eyes.  He had a more olive comp
lexion and he was alwa
ys more serious than 
Blimcia.  She was always happier than -- so this
 was --. {How about some  chocolate to stick in 
your mouth?} 
 

Q: Just--. 

 

A: I don™t know if I should describe Henoch™s brot
her. {You™re not writing about him. Just the 
name  is enough.} 
 

Q: What do you reme mber about how your si
sters we re with these two children? 
 

A: What do you mean? 

 

Q: I don™t know, anything special a
bout the way they
 treated them. 
 

A: They treated them like a mother treats a child. 
They were crazy about th
em.  Not only for them. 
You see, those children, they didn™t have one mo
ther. They had five, six mothers because my  
grandmother was --. They were mo re in my house than they were in their house because we 

lived not far.  Blimcia™s girls, thei r house was 
next to our house so a 
whole day she was by us. 
She ate by us, she went home to eat, to sleep.  
The other one also, they were more home. All  
my sisters, the other si sters considered them 
our  children.  Special with me , I was the closest 
with them. 
 

Q: Because you were the youngest? 

 

A: No, not only the youngest.  I was the one, especi
ally in the war, that I used to go around in 
different towns for me rchandise.  Every time  I cam
e, there was not a time
 that I shouldn™t bring 
some thing special for them.  If it was candy, fru
it about the first cherries
, the first apples, the 
first pears -- every time  if I could only buy a few,
 it was for them.  It was also, that we  always 
laughed, that they knew that I am away in anothe
r town and I have to 
come  back.  Usually I  
came back on a bi cycle; they always used to wa
it.  By Jews there is a saying when you me ntion 
Sabbath, you always say Shabot Kordish.  It means the Holy Sabbath.  She hear d the Shabot 

Kordish, there was another expression that when ch
ildren came  to their grandparents or to their 
aunt, every Saturday they ca me for Sabbath fruit. 
They gave them a treat.They used to come in 
and they used to say Shabbos Optz.  Optz means 
in Jewish, fruit. They
 used to give to ess 
Shabbos Optz to get some thing. When they 
waited for me to bring something, somebody 
me ntioned oh you waiting for hi m because he™s going to bring you Shabbos Optz. This girl she 

reme mbered some thing but she didn™t  reme mber  ex
actly so when I came in, so she came  to me 
and she said if I brought her Sha
bbos Kordish.  It means the Ho
ly Sabbath because she didn™t 
reme mber the expression.  Since then she knew every time I came so both of them wait and 

they say give me  the Shabbos Kordish, it me ans the Sabbath fruit, the Holy Sabbath.  But 

everythi ng for us, we had something.  Naturally th
ey were the first one because we were a very 
close family and the children from my sisters, 
were our children, were th
e same  thing.  It didn™t 
make a difference who the mother was, her mother, 
his mother loved us as much as her, and her 

mother loved her --so it™s always 
the same .  If my mother in th
e ghetto, if she had some thing, if 
I brought her some thing special or some thing, they we
re the first one to have it.  I remember we 
once received a package fromTurkey.  In th
e package was a salami , a Swiss cheese and a 
package of chocolate.All kinds of goodies that
 we didn™t  have it in ghetto.  My mother, 
naturally took it, it was some thi
ng, she divided it in small pieces 
and they were the first ones to 
get it.  Later when I came  toAmer ica so I asked my brother, we got once in ghetto a package  
fromTurkey, did you send it?  He said I didn™t se
nd it but there was once an
 ad in the paper that 
said when you pay in fift een dollars, aTurkey company will send to any place in German-

occupied Europe, a package. So he went, he sent in $15.  
 

Q: This was your brother in Palestine? 

 

A: No, my brother inAmerica.  He sent in the $1
5 and we got it.  It was 
the highlight  in the ghetto 
to get a package for those things.A box of ma rgar
ine, a box of crackers, a box of tea, coffee. 
Then I asked him how ma ny packages did you send 
in?   He said once.  I  asked why once, we 
got it.  He said why didn™t you send it every day.Ye s, he could afford it.  Every day, send in 

$15.  He  said well I didn™t get a receipt that you received it.  I said, how c ould you get a receipt? 

We were in the ghetto.  But to take a chance, ma
ybe 99% it will ge t lost 
but 1% it will come in, 
why not?   So -- it was late.  I reme mber when
 we got those goodies, my mother divided and 
every day they came and they got the piece of cheese
, they got a piece of salami . We were very, 
very, very close and naturally the children we re everything.  For this reason, now I have 

grandchildren their age.  I look
 at the grandc hildren and I see thos e children and how those 
children were undressed. Th
e mot her had to take them in to a gas chamber. The y had to be 

killed being two and three and a half years ol
d. The mi nd cannot absorb it.We  cannot talk 
about it because there are no words to talk about it a million and a half children.  
           Those were such beautiful, beautiful
 children. They didn™t ask 
nothing from the world, they 
only wanted to be alive.  Naturally they didn™t 
realize what™s  going on. This is how they went. 
I think that f you will write about them, you™ll put 
them both together not separate because they 
were -- they lived together -- they were the same 
age, they lived in the 
same  house.  Everything 
I reme mber when they came  to our house in the 
ghetto, they always came together.They were  
beautiful, they were nice dressed and --. 
 

Q: They lived apart from you in the ghetto, otherwise? 

 

A: They lived, before the war, this Blimcia lived 
next door to us because my father bought them a  
house next door to us.  He lived away, I would 
say about 200 me ters.  During the day, he ca me 
over.   During the ghetto 
we lived on this stre
et, we lived far away, ma ybe 100 me ters.  Only 
they had to go all the way to us.  So they 
were by us practically every day, all day. 
 

Q: When they were deported to Belzec, they were with thei r mothers?  

 

A: Yeah, with the mothers. 

 

Q: And who else? 

 

A: They were with thei r mothers and fa thers. 

 

Q: Andfathers? 

 

A: And fathers, the whole family was deported to
gether. You see, when you get a transport like  
this with children like this and special to tell the story, thei r game. They didn™t play ring-a-
round-the-roses or some thing pick
ing up flowers.  In their mi nd 
this was some thing important. 
This Habier went out and he killed Jews. Th
ey turned around in a game .  I witnessed a few 
times, I was standing there, I coul dn™t  grasp it. He tells and he imitates this German, he said 

when you are Jewish you are dead.  Everybody know
s that when he ma kes poof, they fall down. 
 

Q: Do you think they ever saw that? 

 

A: No, no, they just heard talking about. They heard 
talkings that Habier kill
ed today a Jew.  They 
didn™t see it no, but they heard talking about it. 
 

Q: This was the German pol ice? 

 

A: This was the German police.  He was like a me
ister, like a sergeant with the German police. 
Especially he was in this time, a very vicious 
ma n.  He always walked around with his face, he  
always had a big German shepherd on the leash.
  Because mostly German police had German 
shepherds. 
 

Q: Did he work withTa rnoff? 

 

A: What?Tr adon. Tr adon, no.  Because whenTr adon --, well he  worked, he was the police.  But 
then later he was transferred. When the ghetto wa
s there, he wasn™t  ther e anymore. This was 

before the ghetto. They were transferred, you 
know. There was a other guy who worked with 
Tr adon, I describe it in the book, his name  was Smic
her. This is the one who came  to beat up 
my brother and then later he took him out from jail. 
Then later -- so he was also there.  It was 
special certain German policemen that they 
were exceptional vicious. They were known for  
their viciousness. There were some  who were ni
ce.  Nice, it doesn™t  mean that if they would 
catch you without a band on the street, that they wouldn™t arrest you or shoot you.  But they 

didn™t go out of their wa
y to do mor e  harm than they were 
supposed to do. There were a few. 
There was even one I also described in the book, th
at one who was also a sergeant, a meister. 
He used to go for vacation home and he always us
ed to br ing stuff that my brother asked him to 
bring like saccharin and other things which was 
illegal but he brought it
 and my brother bought 
it by him.  He ma de money and my
 brother made money.  Now this is the one, he told us to go 

with the transport the first day. 
 Because he said, we don™t contro
l, the Gestapo controls it and 
you never know when the Gestapo changes from one day t o another. We went with the first day 

with the transportation.  So 
we had Blimcia, who else did we have to have there? 
 

Q: When was his birthday, approxima tely? 

 

A: My father was born 1882 in a village called Dubas, D-u-b-a-s. 

 

Q: InPoland? 

 

A: Poland, this was five ki lome ters from Kolbuszo
wa.  His father whose name  was Na ftali, I am 
named after him, was the manager of a very big 
estate of the whole village because the village 
belonged to our me n.  It so happened that 
the owner was Jewi sh too. Wa nt his name ? 
 

Q: No,no. 

 
A: Now my fat her when he was a teenager, my gr
andfather sent him to Ko
lbuszowa to study in the 
yeshiva.  He rema ined there and ma rrie
d my mother when he was 18 years old. 
 

Q: Wa s it an arranged ma rriage, do you know? 

 

A: Yes. Every marriage was an arranged marriage.  
He re ma ined in that town.  His own brothers 
and sisters, seven brothers and sisters came toAmer
ica before the turn of the century.  We even 
ma de  now a  gathering of the 100
th
 a nniversary of the fa mily comi ng over.  He  was the only one 
who didn™t go because he was so religi ous. 
 

Q: Where was he within the brothers and 
sisters?  Wa s he one of the older --? 
 

A: He was the second from t he youngest. 

 

Q: Were they well off? 

 

A: No, no.  He was a ma nager in a village so he
 had enough to eat and everything.  In the second 
book, I™m writing everything about this fa mily, the 
whole life.  Now he ma rried my mother and 
he started a business in Kolbuszowa.The FirstWa r ruined, he went away. Then he came back, 

they started again and in 1919 was a pogrom. 
 

Q: He fought in theAustrian-Hungarian army?  

 

A: He went but the Jews didn™t fight. They had a 
regime nt that the Jews w
ith beards that usually 
they had guards, guarded trains. He wasn™t  long, 
he came out because he had a lot of children so 
after a short while he came  back.  He was, I think, in the army only six months. 
 

Q: Wa s it called theAustrian-Hungarian army or --? 

 

A: Austrianarmy,Austrian-Hungarianarmy. 
Then later was the pogrom, then later --. 
 

Q: That was in 192_? 

 

A: May 6, 1919.  I cannot forget May 6 because
 I was born May 6, about a year later. 
 

Q: They ma naged to get out before the pogrom?  

 

A: So__. 

 

Q: They ma naged to leave the town before the pogrom?    

 

A: No, no, he was in the pogrom. 

 

Q: Hewas? 

 

A: They were hiding. They went to a Polish acqua
intance that she board by us so that when the 
pogrom started, they ran away with
 the children. They were ther
e three days hiding in the attic 
until the pogrom finished and then they came  b
ack.  But later he starte
d a g a i n t h e bus i ne s s a nd 

he started to become  successful. 
Little by little he  enlarged and 
he became  a wholesaler. Then 
in ™20, I wa s born so he had nine children.  
When I was born, my olde
st brother left for 
America. 
 
Q: It™samazing. 

 

A: He was devoted, he was a Hasidic.  He was a  follower of the ______ Rabbi and he was  
involved in everything what went down, in Jewi
sh and non-Jewish organizations.  He always 

was in the mi ddle of e verything.  He was very 
active, for a while he was a me mber of the  

Jewish Council and he was also deputy ma yor  of
 the town which a Jew could never be the 
mayor. 
 

Q: Why wasn™t  he part of the Judenrat? 

 

A: Myfather? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: We ll, he wasn™t  part of -- first 
thing he was a Jew with a long beard. 
 

Q: AndAnderman didn™t want him then? 

 

A: AndAnderman didn™t want him. They took my  
brother didn™t  have a beard. You see a Jew with 
a long beard was like a red clot
h towards a bull.  So he didn™t 
take those people.  Now before 
the war, olde r people like my father were the 
leaders butAnderman w
ouldn™t accept him.  He  
didn™t have in his Judenrat one 
ma n with a beard.  He was succe
ssful in business, every time  
better and better.  More details about the busine
ss, about conditions I™m wr
iting this out of the 
book. When the war started, we lived in our house 
then later we went to
 the ghetto.  In the 
ghetto, in the 18
th
 ofApril, the Gestapo came in and they
 had a list of 20 Jews because there 
were 2,000 and they said they going to kill one pe
rcent.  But the end was they killed 22 Jews. 
One of them, my  father was on the list. Theykilled him while we were in our house and the 

details are in the book. 
 

Q: Yeah, I know this. 

 

A: Yeah but the significance of hi m being killed is 
that before they shot him fi ve times, the last 
time, his last words were 
 

 (END OF SI DE B,TAP E 1)  (ON THIS  TAPE 2  WI FE IS  PRIMARY ONE B EING 
INTERVIE WED.  HUS BAND™SWORDSARE IN BRACE S.) 
 

A: My father was born in Delatyne. D-e-l-a-t-
y-n-e in P _____, eastern Poland. {This is the same  
section where this other guy from __.}Al most, but
 this is eastern Pola
nd.  In November, in 
1895.  He attended agricultural school and also 
yeshivoth so he was very knowledgeable in 
Judaic studies and secular studies.
  His hobby was a painter. As a 
ma tter of fact this saved him 
when he was in theAust rian army. When theydrafted him, he used to caligraph to write, to 

ma ke all the posters. {Not a painter of rooms but --}. 
 

Q: Calligrapher or artist? 

 
A: Artist, this even saved hi m when he was drafte
d to theAustrian army that he was assigned to 
prepare posters or to paint posters and what el
se they had, proclama tio
ns, whatever. {I have 
beautiful pictures from the three brothers what 
they were taken to the army.  I think I showed 
you.}. Then we went into the lumber business. 
 

Q: After he got back from the army? 

 

A: Did I tell you that he was Dovid Mendel?   Or 
I didn™t say it, just my 
father, how did I start? 
 

Q: I just have David Petranker. 

 

A: Yeah, he was actually name d David Mendel Petranker. 

 

Q: M-e-n-d-e-l? 

 

A: Ye s.  But he was known as David 
Petranker. But when he signed he
 had to use it.  In the lumber 
business and when he married Freida Ginga Pe
tranker, he settled in S_________ and worked in 
lumber business. 
 

Q: Did he work for a private --? 

 

A: With my  grandfather, now they have their 
private business until I think, ™37 or ™36 when he 
became the vice-di rector of --.  {In 1937, all the 
forests in this section were nationalized}.  By 
the governme nt. {By the governme nt
. So when they were nationalized and they created a  
Ministry of the Forestry.}. My father was a Jew,
 so he couldn™t become  t he director. { Because 
he was a Jew, he couldn™t be head of the Ministry of the Forestry so he became the assist ant. 

They picked out some  fi gurehead, so he shoul
d be --}.This ______ that they write in the book 
who helped me in the war very much.  He was th
e director, my father was the vice-director. {He 
was his assistant of the Ministry
 of Forestry because he was 
a Jew but this was a very high 
position.  Besides this he had his own business 
too.}. He was an ardent Zionist, Hash ___, like a 
move me nt you know, that they believed in Hebr
ew and they studied Hebrew and wanted to 

ma ke sure that his daughters, 
you can see that he adored us.  
He was a very devoted father -- 
that we got the proper Jewish as well as secula
r education.  When the Russians occupied our 
town in 1939, I think it was the end of Septem
ber, something, end of September, he was 
demoted from his job.  He had to work as a labo
rer, physical worker in scrap iron. Then thanks 
to an acquaintance, he got a job in a chemical 
laboratory, analyzing ___; you know they used to 
use it for heat.  Peat, yes. The Russians so this is how he wor ked.When the Germans came in -- 

I don™t want what we went through, it was very hard because the _____ is not very important 

what we went through. When the Germans came, 
he was assigned as slave laborer to work on 
the railroad and in 1942, in October, they took 
-- gathered or took all the laborers who worked 
outside the ghetto, also in the railroad authority 
and they shipped them all to Belzec.  On the 
way, on the way to Belzec, he jump ed. You can even describe how he pried the boards of the 

floor of the cattle car with his hands, no tool 
nothing and he jumped out of the running cattle 
car.  Only one girl, age 17 from Kolami a joined 
him. The rest I guess, they didn™t  want to 

separate. They jumped and successfully reached
 a peasant house on the outskirts of Halech. 
Again I was sitting there, this terrible, I was 
one hour walking distance and my father knew I 
am alive and then he went for me i n ghetto. 
 Reached a Ukrainian peasant™s house who gladly 
employed them as field hands because her husband 
was in the army in Russia and she needed. 

But my father didn™t see me  at 
the transport, didn™t  see his da
ughter Amaria, who™
s still -- you 
must put those people in
, his daughterAmaria who was the last
 survivor of the whole fa mily in 
the transport.  
 
Q: Whichtransport? 

 

A: ToBelzec. 

 

Q: The one he was on? 

 

A: Yeah, because they took fresh from the ghett
o. Then they brought from the working places  
wherever there are slave workers, they gathered t
ogether and they loaded on the cattle car.  He 

didn™t see me.  I don™t want to go there because 
we had an agreement in case we are separated, 
it™s all in the book. 
 

Q: Right, I remember. 

 

Q: But what I -- what you write. Although he foundsafe haven, he decided to go to the train and to 
go back to the ghetto to look 
for his daughter which meant de
ath sentence if he would be 
caught.  On the train, an Ukrain
ian architect who bought lumber fr
om him and befriended him -
- I™m sorry this was an Ukrainian.  I can™t  help
 if people write what  th
ey want. Wh o befriended 
him,  pointed hi m out t o the Gestapo because in
 each train was a German police and Gestapo, 
pointed out. 
 

Q: He knew this ma n be fore, dealt with him in business? 

 
A: He used to come , dealt business, used to come  
for tea to our house. We  
were very friendly.  I 
know the name  too, I don™t want to use because it was 
told to me later.  Pointed out to me later.  
{Why don™t you use the name? } IsuzanWi zy. 
 
Q: I don™t know how to spell that. 

 

A: L-y-s-y-j. 

 

Q: L-y-s-y-j? Okay. 

 

A: Pointed hi m out and he was taken back to St ei
nswadoff to the Rudolph™s Mill, this is flour mill, 
Rudolph™s which was a gathering pl ace for the Jews
 who were supposed to be sent to Belzec. 
You know the gathering place? 
 

Q: Ye s. And so they waited in a warehouse there? 

 

A: And then they were shot, ye
s. Without food, without nothing. 

 

Q: He was shot at the mill? 

 

A: Yes, he was shot at the mill.  So you see this 
is supposed to be told because first of all, the 
devotion of the parent, to show even if you™re safe, the irony of fate is that I was just one hour  

walking distance from where he was. 

 
Q: Mundich had found you? 

 

A: Mundich told me .  Everybody told me  that so
mething they caught a Jew, like here somebody 
would catch a killer or 
G-d knows what. You caught a Jew a
nd what happen.  My father was 
just one hour walking distance.  I don™t know that he is there and he didn™t  know where I am. 

He thought I am in the ghe
tto and I thought that he was sent to
 Belzec, I didn™t 
know.   He told 
me  that he would get in touch with me, within th
ree weeks if he ma nage d to get off the train.  I 
didn™t hear from hi m so I assume d that he is 
dead.Therefore I let myself be persuaded by the 
car ride to go to his house.  
So when this happened he heard 
about it, Mundich, but he didn™t 
want to tell me  until after months later, what ha
ppened to my father. By the way, the girl who 
jumped with him,  survived. M
undich told me .  She was by the peasant™s house and then she let 
herself be caught as non-Jew to a slave labor a
nd she survived inAustria because she got in 
touch with this Mundich. Told
 Mundich the whole story.  
Also she needed some body like I  
needed somebody, when you are ma squerading as a ge
ntileAfter all you have to have fa mily, to 
get some  mail.  So Mundich used to write to 
her.  He just doesn™t  
know when the war ended, 
what happened to her.  But he told
 me  he used to get letters from her fromVi enna. This is the 
story. I think it is very important, devotion, courage, no nothing to be packed like sardines; to be 

able to pry the boards; to jump 
out of a running -- a
ny train to jump.The poi
nt is that you only 
have slightly bruised knees. The girl was not harmed at all.  
 

Q: Did he break through the 
bottom of the train, do you know? 
 

A: {They didn™t jump, they didn™t jump. What 
they did, the train has a floor. The floor are  
grooved boards so he pulled out two boards. Wh
ile the train was running, what they did, they 
let themselves down, through and between the wh
eels and the train went and they were not 
touched.} I mean he had only the he
ight, the bruised knees I was told
 and the girl not at all.  I 
think a story like this again, it™s
 unusual, hair-raising, 
courage and devotion should be told.  It™s  
not only because he™s my father but this shou
ld be told the same  thing about my sister. 
 

Q: What was his father ™s  business?  
 He was in the lumber business?  
 

A: No, no.  Be fore the FirstWorldWa r, my  father
 was from a very wealth
y fa mily.  He used to 
have forests and they used to have mills.  During the FirstWorldWar --. 
 

Q :  L u mb e r mi l l s ?  

 

A: Ye s.  During the FirstWorldWa r, it burnt down. 
They rema ined only with an inn and a grocery 
store. This what remained and they were not anym
ore so rich. The point is also that his mother  
used to say always you see, ma terial things you 
have, you can lose.  She believe very much in 
giving education to her ch
ildren and all her children got educati
on. This is why my father too, 
he say, I prepare dowry for you, he had hard rea
lty but I don™t know if 
he would if he would 
also foresee if I would be able to take adva
ntage.  So let me  give my daughters the best 
education that I can because with
 this they will be able alwa ys
 to ma ke a living.This why, do 
don™t forget, this is from 
kindergarten, he paid --. 
   

Q: How ma ny J e ws, did you go to private 
school?  to primary?  to kindergarten? 

 

A: No, I didn™t.Then secondary school gymnasiu
m was very expensive and he had three daughters 

only one year apart.  He sent us all to all this and don™t forget that th
e earning possibilities in 
Poland were not the same like in the United St ates.  
To be able to afford it, means that he had to 
deny himself certain things to be able to do it.  
After all, he was not a m
illionaire, he was not the 
richest man, he was comfortable but not the richest,
 but you always have pr
iori ties. With him, 
priorities was education. 
 
Q: Do you remember, did he ever paint in the house? 

 

A: Oh, yes, this is good you told me .  He ma ke murals
, he liked also to ma ke enlarged portraits.  I  
reme mber Hertzel and others and also he always lik
ed to study.  He learne d French by himself. 
He was an avid reader; he liked the history 
of _____ in German. Actually he could quote you 
from the big German poets, Heine, the same 
way like fromTa lmud. Bec a use of it, you know the 
Jews did not like to go to courts when they had 
a dispute. They rather 
settle among themselves. 
My late father was chosen to be the judge because of his knowledge.Actually, I wrote it in the 

book but they took it out. I don™t know why.  They 
didn™t allow me  too much space in this book 
but he read.  But this is very important.  So 
he was chosen to be ar
bitrator because of his 
knowledge.  Between the me rchants, business pe
ople and the people in the lumber business. 
 

Q: Just among Jewish me rchants or --? 

 

A: Yes, Jewish merchants. They didn™t like to go 
to courts, also the expens
es and also they didn™t 
like to run always to the rabbi and the rabbi had 
like a judge. They rather settle in their own 
line of business, they thought th
ey would be better unde
rstood than the othe
r party. The two 
parties used to nominate, choose like a judge, it™s
 called b___.  My late father was chosen many 
times. 
 
Q: He wanted to emigrate to Palestine hi mself?  
 

A: He saw that there™s no future for us in Poland. 

 

Q: This was after everything was nationalized?  Is that when he became --? 

 

A: No, even before because of the anti-Semitism. 
 He saw that {Nationalize was nothing against 
him because he wasn™t  --}.  But he saw that ther
e™s no future. Therefore he planned to emigrate 
to Palestine at that time ..  He felt that he wa
nts to give us educati
on and save enough money.  
Because in or der to go to Palestine, you need
ed at that time, I think, 10,000 zlotys, not per 

fa mily, per pe rson. {5,000}. Fa milies, 10,000 and this was a lot. 
 

Q: For a family? 

 

A: At that time it was a lot of money.  So he wa
nts to give us education, 
therefore he taught us.  
Made sure that we knew Hebrew
 and as our foreign language in gymnasium, we had a choice 
between French, Germa n and English. We  have c
hosen English so we have to prepare it, to 
prepare us for studies in Palestin
e and to emigration to Palestine. What is if you want to know , 
it™s very unusual also about him.  He  didn™t ha
ve any sons so you know we took from the family 
--. You saw the family picture, ma ybe you reme mber. 
 

Q: Ye s, he had that adopted son? 

 

A: A boy from that family, yes.  He raised us like bo
ys. The bad part is which later turned out to be 
the good one, is that every Friday evening, he made
 us study with him after dinner. We  had to 
study with him wintertime so called bocherash ____ this is tracked from our sages and the 
_____, that means the sa_______.You know in the Bible 
each week is differ
ent.  Imagine three 
girls to keep us and to study and G-d forbid 
if we didn™t know it.  In summertime when my 
friends used to go to the park for a walk or to
 the movies, we had to study with _______.This is 
also the things of the sages and the wi se me n. 
 If one of us didn™t know, he deprived us of 
allowance to go to movie. You know there wa
s a carrot and stick; a 
lot of laugh, a lot of 
devotion, attention, strict like boys.  He raised us
 like a Pr ussian officer. You know girls like it 
more easy. Thank G-d my mother was a very 
sweet, easy- going woma n.  
With my mother we 
were like friends, she was also 
very young mother. With him, 
also he laughed and he bossed 
around four wome n in his house. 
 

Q: When did you adopt this boy? 

 

A: My parents took him in, I think, in 1935. 

 

Q: Who was he ? 

 

A: He was my mother ™s  kid, fi
rst cousin.  His father died. 

 

Q: Your mother ™s first cousin™s child? 

 

A: Ye s.  He died. At that time  he was, I thi
nk, five years old when they took him.  My father 
________him over.  His name  was Manasha. The 
same  thing, my father sent him to the 
Hebrew school, extra expense. extr
a clothing and everythi
ng.  He still wanted very much a boy.  
Actually this is why he had thre
e daughters because he tr
ied twice. Then he said the third time  
must be boy and it wasn™t .  Now between you and me , it was ______ in his fa mily. All the 

sons, all the brothers had daughters,
 all the sisters had s
ons.  It™s  unusual but this is how it was.  
My father was the second eldest or the third elde
st child in his fa mily, the second or the third. 
 

Q: The second eldest of three? 

 

A: No, wait a mome nt.  How ma ny there were.  Five
 sons and three daughters.  So he was the --. 
 

Q: So eight children altogether? 

 

A: Ye s, I think so.At least alive, because they had 
so me children when they died in infancy.  But to 
my knowledge, eight and he
 was the second oldest. 
 

Q: We re they a religious family, do you know? 

 

A: My grandparents were religious, not as religi
ous as Norman™s fa mily. As a ma tter of fact, 
surprisingly my paternal grandmother was very we
ll educated in Judaic studies.  She had done 
with her children the sa me thing what my fa ther 
with us. They lived like in a summer resort.  I 
reme mber when we used to come  there and his brother from Germany us ed to come , she used to 

ask them questions.  If some body didn™t know, sh
e didn™t hesitate to punish them by slapping 
their face.   I reme mber this as a child when we
 went there.  But the sisters went to school, the 

sisters used to all play mando
lin, progressive. So the brothers
 nod their heads, progressive.  

They were progressive, Jewish, trad
itional.  I think about my fath
er, what to think but the most 
important is really the episode -- . 
 
Q: How he escaped to come  back to find you? 

 

A: Devotion and also the courage. Again he didn™t 
go like sheep to slaughter, it™s very important .  
{To pull out boards --} Unfortunately he gamble
d, he should really not gone for me . But he 
couldn™t live with the thought. 
 

Q: Withoutknowing? 

 

A: He didn™t --  how will I manage to shelter a ch
ild. He was saved by this woma n, this peasant.  
She didn™t ask any questions.  By the way, he
 didn™t look Jewi sh.  He was blond, green eyes. 
 

Q: That benefited you later in a way? 

 

A: But my father was young. 

 

Q: In terms of having a look that di
dn™t look Jewish, that helped you too? 

 

A: No, my father looked less like Je wish.  I had 
Semitic eyes don™t forget. With me, really was 
luck that the Germans thought I™m Polish and 
the Poles thought I™m Ger man but no one took 
me  for their own, you know.  My boss questione d my
 eyes, Semitic eyes.  In college, I was 
always on the offensive instead of being on the defensive. You know the book when the 

policeman followed me  and I wanted to know if he™s
 just a wo ma nizer or really --.  He followed 
me  to the ladies™ room.  Instead to shiver and 
to feel defeated, I jump on him, what right do you 
have to follow me? This is -- af
ter all I knew who he is. This put him off!  He was a police and 
like nothing he would have given me  away.  In al
l instances like my boss, I start to say no and 

to deny and to be caught and to blush, I said 
most probably my grandmother was Jewish.  He 
thought it™s  the best j
oke.You know this is how I was able. We  saw now a movie and I told 
Nor man, it was very similar I acted.Which was it,
 Norman, the last one that we saw?   Oh, you 
didn™t the movie ‚ShiningThrough™? 
 

Q: No,no. 

 

A: When she acts like a spy. 

 

Q: Right, I saw the comi ng attractions. 

 

A: The same . Don™t forget I didn™t have any e
xperience and I was 17, 18 but
 some how my logic in 
this dictated me  to act like it is.  My father
 had a good chance.  He had a very good command of 
Polish and because we didn™t speakYi ddish, he didn™t have the singsong like I don™t have.  I 

don™t have in my Polish and I don™t have in my E
nglish. This helped a lot because if you have 
the singsong, imme diately they recognize it.  Ma
ny looked not Jewish but they couldn™t do it.  
So please put
