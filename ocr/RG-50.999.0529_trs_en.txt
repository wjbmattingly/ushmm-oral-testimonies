F
ir s t 
P
ers on today.  Thos e two
 
lights  will remain but we'll try not to look at thos e.  I'm  glad you have 
family m em ber s and friends  here with you today.
 
 
Manny, you wer e born in Riga, Latvia, in 1936 but
 
your  family s tayed ther e and c ertainly yours  
was  a s hor t one befor e you m oved to Budapest, Hungary. War began in Eur ope when Germ any 
invaded Poland when you were 3 years  old.  Before we turn to the war  years , let's  start with you telling 
us  about your  family, why your parents were in Budapes t in the years  leading up to the start ofWor
ld 
War II and the Holoc aus t. 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Well, m y parents are both ethnic ally Hungar ian.  My father fr om eas ter n Hungar y 

whic h you m ight know par tic ular ly as  the hom e bas e of one Count Dr ac ula, nam ely Trans ylvania.  My 

3 
 
m other  is from s outhern Hungar
y whic h then later bec am e that whic h we us ed to know as  the former  
Yugoslavia.  It is  all formers  bec aus e c ountries have c hanged.  The ethnic ity was  Hungar ian.  
 
 
My father wanted a job in Budapes t.  Bec aus e of c ertain c onditions and som e of the, what 
was  
c alled, Numerus Claus us , the Hungarian Nazi laws , he had a diffic ult tim e getting working papers  
in Hungar y
 b
ec aus e he had s er ved in the Czec h Arm y.  Now, under stand he's  born in a village in 
Hungary.  It becom es  Czec hos lovakia after the Firs t World War
.  
Th
r ough no fault of his  own it is now 
the Uk r aine.  So as a Czec h c itizen, bec aus e he was  in the Arm y, he c ouldn't get papers.  He found a 
pos ition that he wanted to have in Riga.  And you have to be bor n where your mother  is s o I was  born 
in Riga.
 
 
As  a c
ons equenc e, as  soon as he was  able to get paper s  to, in fac t, be in Hungar y, we 
m oved.  And that happened months  after I was  born.  He r ec eived thos e papers  s om etim e 
in 
ear ly 
1936.  I know that I was  told
 
--
 
obvious ly I don't rem em ber
 
--
 
that my mother
 
--
 
he m oved to Hungar y in 
per haps  J uly and then two, three months later I moved when I was  old enough to travel by tr ain.  My 

two unc les
, 
m y m other 's  brother and her br other

law
,  
c am e to Riga to help her  m ove me in a bas ket 
on a train to Hungar y wher e I lived until I was  depor ted in 1944. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Manny, I think your grandfather , who was  a r abbi, s tepped down fr om  the pulpit 
bec aus e of c hanges in the pr evailing language due to politic al leader s hip changes.  Can y
ou s har e a 
little bit with us  about 
that?
 
> > Manny Mandel:  As  I s aid, the former Yugos lavia, whic h was  par t of Hungary at one tim e, my 

grandfather was  the r abbi of a c om m unity in Yugoslavia c alled Novi Sad.  Cities  had multiple names  
bec aus e it was  m ultiple cultur es  and m ultiple governor s 
or gover nm ents .
 
 
My gr andfather, in 1918, at the end of the Fir stWorld War, when Yugos lavia was  c reated, the 
language of the 
c ountr y went fr om Hungar ian to S
er bo
-
Croatian.  My grandfather dec ided
 
--
 
this  was 
par t of his  str angeness , I s uppos e but he dec ided that he c ould cer tainly deliver  s erm ons  in Hungarian, 
Yiddis h, Ger m an, per haps in Hebrew, I'm  not sur e
, b
ut he did not s peak  the Cr oatian well enough to 
s atisfy 
him
s elf s o he s aid if I c an't deliver a s erm on as  I think I s hould, I will s tep off the pulpit, whic h he 
did.  He bec am e the adm inis tr ator of the loc al c om m unity and lived there until deported to Aus c hwitz in 
1944.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before that
, 
your  father
 
--
 
I'm s orr y.  Your father  had been an im portant c antor in 
Budapes t.  How did he get to
 
that pos ition?  It was  a s ignific ant pos ition.
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Well, he was  a s ignific ant
 
--
 
cantor of signific ant r ank , if you will.  He trained in 
Vienna at the then wel
l-
k nown c antor ian s c hool that
 
folk s  know nothing about and I only know from 
s torie
s.  The job he had in Riga was  an im portant job als o bec aus e of whom he s uc c eeded, a man who 
had been the c antor of Riga for 35 year s.  And thos e wer e his  c ompetition.
 
 
In Riga, my father rec eiv ed the
 
--
 
got the job.  He c om peted with two other gentlem en. 
 
One of 
the gentlem en was  a native of 
the 
c ity of Riga and had jus t c ome back fr om the United States  wher e he 
was  a leading tenor at The Metr opolitan opera.  He was  als o a c antor .  The other  was  a well
-
known 
c antor in the c ity of Hannover  who later had a long c ar eer  in South Afr ic a, J ohannes burg.  So this is  

very high
-
level s tuff that goes on that today does not exist.
 
 
So my father, when he found out there was  a job open, one of four  chief cantor s in Budapest, 
he applied for it and he was  s elected.
 
> > Bill
 
Bens on:  If I under s tood correctly, onc e he ac c epted that very prominent pos ition, he felt, in your  
words , he had hit the big
-
tim e.  But he had been offered c antor pos itions in other  c ities, I believe, prior 
to that.
 
> > Manny Mandel:  In his  s earc h to get
 
to Budapes t, he had had thes e auditions , they wer e c alled, in 
Holland, in London, in a number of plac es .  He was  very well rec eived but his  own notion was  that what 

he was  waiting for is , in fac t, Budapes t, whic h he r ec eived.  Thought he had ac hieved the 
pinnac le of 
his  s uc c es s, a lifetime pos ition.  And exc ept for the
 
m ustac he he would have been
 
[Inaudible].
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The full forc e of the war and the Holoc aust would not hit your  c omm unity, in Hungary, 

until 1944.  Ther e wer e m any diffic ulties  onc e
 
war was  underway in Europe in the fall of 1939.  Tell us  
about the c irc umstanc es for your  family and for you in thos e earlier years  of the war .

> > Manny Mandel:  I don't have first pers on rec ollec tion of 1939 and 1940.  I c an tell you anec dotally
.  
F
or  t
hos e of you who have either been through the Mus eum  here, the permanent exhibit, or ar e going 
through, towar ds  the end ther e is  a s ection whic h has  to do with r es is tanc e.  In that s ec tion ther e is  a 
s er ies  of photogr aphs of a woman c alled Hannah 
Szenes ,
 
a 
Hungarian woman who with two other s 
par ac huted into Hungar y in or der to try to help promote the c aus e of the allies .  Their partic ular 

qualific ations was  not as s pies  but they s poke Hungarian whic h is  not an eas y language to s peak .  

They were all c aptured and s hot.
 
 
The reas on I m entioned this  is  Hannah 
Szenes  
wanted to learn Hebr ew befor e she, in fac t, 
went to Pales tine.  Her  teac her  was  my unc le, my father's  younges t br other, who lived with us  as a 
s tudent at the Univers ity of Budapest.  And in 1939 or s o
 
s he would c om e to the hous e for les s ons.  
And s he would s ay hello, nic e little boy, tap m e on the head.  So s he k new m e.  I did not know her.  I 
know this  whole thing only bec aus e I've been told.  I don't r emember he
r, n
ot fr om  the age of 3. 
 
A  little 
lat
er  on I will pr obably get to that, the Pogr om in Novi Sad happens  when I'm  5
 
1/2.
 
 
Life in Budapest is reas onably ok bec aus e 
--
 
you folk s  need to know that Hungar y is  an ally of 
the Nazis .  As a c ons equenc e, we did not s ee a Nazi or a Germ an s oldier on Budapes t ter ritor y until 

1944.  Ther efor e, 1939, 
`
40, 
`
41, 
`
42 are r easonably ok fr om day

to
-
day, partic ularly for a little guy like 
m e at the time who was  pr otected and kind of s helter ed in a bubble of s orts  by his  par ents.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  As you jus t s aid,
 
you didn't see German tr oops  ther e until 1944.  Tell us  who the Arr ow 
Cros s  were.
 
> > Manny Mandel:  As  you know, the Nazis  wer e a politic al party, the national s oc ialis ts  and s o forth.  

Hungar y had its  own ver s ion.  Their s ign or c all s ign was  not the s was tika that you're familiar  with but 
c r os s ed arrows  fr om  the Hungar y word 
nyil 
having to do with arrows .  They were probably as  vic ious  as  
the Nazis  but had les s power .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you m entioned, ear lier, the Hungar y pas s ed their  own vers ion in the 
`
20s.  What 
were s om e of the restr ic tions  impos ed onc e the war  began?
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Em ploym ent, wher e you c ould work , how you c ould work, who would go to s c hool.  

The Num erus  Claus us by tr ans lation r eally m eans  a numeric al quota s ys tem  in they r estr ict ed what you 
c ould and c ould not do depending on who you were.  That would not affec t a 4

old.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In 1942, you wer e for c ed to wear  yellow s tar s . What do
 
you
 
r em em ber  about that? 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  The r ule was  that we had to put on yellow s tars .  Everybody did it.  If you wer e 

c aught without a star and you s hould have had one, you wer e s hot on the s pot
 m
ost of the time.  I 
thought the yellow s tars  wer e terr ific.  But here I was  a little guy, 6 years old, les s  than 6 yet and was  

jus t like 
all the adults.  They had yellow s tars  and s o did I.  
W
oopy
-
doo for m y s ide.
 
 
The point is, I did not unders tand this was  a m ark  of dis tinc tion but a target.  And let me 
illus tr ate that in a differ ent way.  Som e
 
time when I was  7 or 7
 
1/2 or  something like
 
that, I s aid to m y 
father:  I wonder  if it's  time for you to buy me a bicyc le.  I had kind of a large tric yc le but I was  big 
enough to ride a bike.  Not a full
-
s ized one but maybe an 18
-
inc her.  I s aid, "Would you do that?"  He 
s aid to me:  Of c our s e I wo
uld exc ept for two r eas ons .  One is a m inor reas on but the other is a major 
r eas on.  
 
 
What ar e the r easons ?  Num ber one r eas on is you s aw in the pictures before, we lived on the 
fifth floor of the apartment building.  We had an elevator  but
 
the building was  50 years at the tim e, 100, 
120, s o was  the elevator.  And parts  broke.  And the factor ies that m ade the replac ement parts  for 

elevator s  wer e m anufac tur ing militar y har dwar e.  So the elevator  parts becam e ver y m uc h low on the 
pr ior ity pole of when the elevator would be fixed.  It 
would 
work  for  a week, out for a m onth, work  for a 
m onth, out for a week .  
 
 
So he s aid to m e I would have to truck the bic yc le down for you five flights  and up again 
bec aus e I was  not big enough to do that. 
 
He 
would do that.  M
y father was  a ver y powerful, young m an 
in his  30s .  That was  not a problem.  But there's a different pr oblem.  And this  is  through the yellow 

s tars.  He s aid, well, we ride the bic yc le in the park .  And in Eur ope that's what you do.  And if you're 
r iding 
in the park  and I'm r unning behind you and you're out of m y s ight for 12 s ec onds , s om ebody 
c ould whack you on the head not bec aus e they want to take the bike but bec aus e the yellow s tar
™
s  the 

5 
 
target that s ays  it's  open s eas on to whac k  the kid in the head. 
 
And that's the a r isk I'm not going to 
take.  Therefore no bic ycle.
 
 
I began to understand that m aybe this  yellow s tar was  not a m
ark of d
is tinc tion but a target 
whic h was n't
 
--
 
I was  not ac c os ted but m any people wer e.  And I could have been.  But I was n'
t.  
Maybe I was  luc ky.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During that time were you able to c ontinue your s c hooling?  If s o, what was  that like for 
you?
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Well, s c hool was
 
--
 
I began s chool at the age of 6 and 42.  As  it happened, we lived 
on the s treet that
 
we lived a num ber of the hous es , num ber 13.  The s c hool was  at number 44.  Now, 
think  about 
it.  We're talking two bloc k s  away.  Yet with the yellow s tar
 
--
 
I'm told on oc c as ion I would 
have s om ebody follow m e to s c hool depending what the news  was  bringing.  If there was  a r as h of 
people being whacked on the head, s omebody would follow me to sc hool.  I didn't k now this .  Not 
nec es s arily m y par ents .  So although
 
--
 
interes tingly, our apartm ent was  on the c or ner  of the building.  
My par ents  c ould s ee the s c hool from  their bedr oom, number 44.  Yet s omebody would follow me.
  
 
 
So I did not exper ienc e any s ignific ant kinds  of things but then I'm  6 years  old.  The r ealization 
of the star was  not as  muc h of a m ark  of the distinc tion.  It happens  later.  But m y life c ontinues  very 

m uc h in the bubble that they c r eated for me, in my apartm ent, som e friends , that kind of stuff.  I had 
s om e friends on the s ame floor.  One floor  below.  The only kid I rem em ber  vis iting outs ide of the 

apar tm ent was  a kid around the c or ner
 
who was  my friend.  But life was  fairly plac id.  And though it 
was n't for the adults , it was  for  m e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Speaking of adults, your  father was  as s igned to a labor battalion.  What did that mean?
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Hungarian m en were in the Ar my.
  
They wer e in the Russ ian front.  The work that 
had to be done by m en who were not ther e was  perform ed by thes e legions, battalions , of labor for c e of 
J ewis h m ales  who wer e not Arm y eligible.  So they would be out
 
--
 
m y father  would get a note or a 
p
hone 
c all or a vis it that s aid on Tues day at 3:00, you'll be at the tr ain station.
  
You'll be gone for a day 
or  a week or  an indefinite am ount of tim e.  He was  home and away with inc redible frequenc y to the 
point I didn't r ealize when he would be home and not at hom e.  I c aught him  with the bic yc le dis c us s ion 
on one of his hom e s tays.
 
 
They did m ining.  They did agr ic ulture.  They did repair of r oads, repair fr om  bom bings , heavy, 
phys ic al work for whic h none of them  wer e qualified but they lear ned. 
 
They were young enough to 
withs tand 
that.  Food was  not a m ajor benefit but that was  going on in Hungary partic ularly.  Mos t of the 
people that I knew, my unc les , were all in labor cam p exc ept for  the youngest who was  with us , who 

taught Hebr ew bec aus e he
 
was  s till at the univers ity.  He was able to finish the univers ity with a yellow

> > Bill Bens on:  In Dec em ber
 
1941, your fam ily 
had a hor rifying exper ience while vis iting your aunt in 
another c ity.  Tell us  what you c an about that.
 
> > Manny Mandel:  We talked a little ear lier about m y gr andfather, my mother 's father.  He lived in, 

again, in Novi Sad, whic h is  down the Danube from  B
udapest
, m
aybe three hour s or s o by train.  So in 
the winter , Decem ber of 1941, my parents  dec ided to go down to s pend the week with my grandparents  

on a vis it.  I was n't in s c hool yet.  My father had the time.  So we did.
 
 
My m other had two s is ter s  in Novi Sad, both of whos e hus bands died in labor  c amp a little bit 
later during the war , both of whom  s ur vived but their  hus bands didn't.  We s tayed in the home of one of 
them.  I have no rec ollec tion s pec ific ally of what I did
.   All I 
do r em ember m y unc le own
ed, ran or had 
par tners hip in a c ork  fac tor y.  He took  me ther e.  He had a s pec ial bic yc le with a s eat built on the 
handle bar s  that was  s afe for  a c hild.  We r ode to the 
factor y.
  
I'm reminded I did that. What I s aw I 
c ouldn't tell you. 
 

 
That was  the s econd or thir d day. We heard there was  some c ommotion in the s tr eet.  Within 
five minutes  of that c omm otion, two polic em en came upstairs to the door, knock , knock .  Rather gently
, 
t
hey s aid, "Ladies  and gentlem en, you need to dres s  war mly.  You need to go outs ide. We have to 
c onduc t a c ens us ."  
 

6 
 
 
We all know what a c ensus  is . We have one her e every 10 years .  We had one in 2010.  The 
Germ ans and the German minions  and their buddies  and what not kind of felt if you do a c ens us  ever y 
15 m inutes , exagger ation, but ever y 15 m inutes, then you knew wher e ever ybody was .  If you knew 
wher e people wer e, you c ould c ontr ol them .
 
 
Well, it's  logic al, as  tr agic as  it bec om es .  We're told to c om e out to the str eet.  My m other, m y 
father and I and m y m other 's younger sister.  There wer e three s is ter s all together, both younger than 
m y m other.  We wer e told to turn left and to walk in that dir ection.  I know that we walked for s ome tim e.  
I walked.  My father c arr ied me.  My mother c ar ried m e.  We were warm .  It was  winter
tim e.  There was  
s now on the ground but it was n't bitter  or a ter rible day.  But we wer e well dr es s ed.  
 
 
After m aybe a c ouple of hour s , I don't know exac tly how long, we arr ived at a plac e whic h I 
r ec ognized.  It was  an eight
-
foot s tockade fenc e on the left and we were walking along this fence.  I 
r ec ognized it bec aus e the pr evious  s umm er jus t a few months  before I had been there.  In Eur opean 

c ities  whic h are not on the lake or not on the oc ean but ar e on the r iver , the river bec om es  a beac h.  
The people build wade pools , hot pools, therm al pools , c old pools, res taurants , amus ement parks along 
a two, thr ee, four
-
m ile stretc h along the Danube r ight in the c ity.  And ins ide this  fenc e about 200, 
300
 
yards , m aybe m ore, wer e thes e partic ular developm ents , these entertainm ent c enter s .  
 
 
So I r ec ognized it.  My parents, of c ours e, did bec aus e they had lived there befor e.  I had no 
idea why I was  there.  Nobody knew why we were there. We wer e jus t walking along this  stockade 
fenc e. We notic ed after  a while, I don't k now how long, that a piec e down the road, the fenc e gates, 
enor mous, big s tock ade wooden gates, wer e open and people wer e turning left towar ds  the river .  We 
kept m oving along.  My gr andpar ents  already joined us .  Some other people. We wer e in the g
roup of 
m aybe a dozen to 18 people, kind of 
addling
 
along.
 
 
As  we c ame to m aybe 100, 150 yar ds  from  the gate ther e's  a polic em an on the right who s ays  
to my father, "Mis ter  what are you doing her e?"  My father s aid, "I'm vis iting with my fam ily," in
-
laws , 
s o 
forth.  He s ays , 
ﬁT
at's  not what I mean.  That's your bus ines s.  But he s ays , what are you doing her e?  
You're not from here.  Therefore if you c ounted in the c ens us, you'll m ess up the num ber s  in s o m any 

ways .
ﬂ
  
It saved our life.  He s aid "Step as ide."  We all s tepped as ide.
 
 
I'm s ur e by c oinc idenc e, within m inutes of the stepping as ide, a s taff guard c am e down the 
r oad, the guy c am e up in the uniform .  I don't even know what kind of uniform he had.  He had a 

pow
-
wow with the offic ials  ther e
 a
nd announc ed on the bullhorn, "Ladies  and gentlemen, the 
r equirements of the c ensus  have been m et.  Pleas e go home."  There's a s c hool on your way a s hor t 

dis tanc e
; 
ther e's hot c offee and hot choc olate.  Have s ome if you like.  Go home.  Whic h we did. 
 
 
What we did
n't know
,  
what we didn't know, was  that everybody who turned left in toward the 
r iver  walked out about 300
 
yards  of whatever .  The r iver was  fr ozen but it had been blas ted open that 
m or ning by c annon fir e bec aus e the ic e was  thick .  Thes e people were s hot in the back, into the r iver , 
and they were found, if found at all, when the r iver  thawed in Mar c h or they were never found at all.  
350 people
 w
er e killed.
 
 
When I s aid the guy s aved our life, I mean it.  He didn't know it but that's  what he did.  He s aid 
he rec ognized my father bec aus e he was  a foot patr olm an in our neighborhood in Budapes t.  My father 

walked around the neighbor hood lots of times to var ious  plac es , offic es and s o forth, and he rec ognized 
him .  I gues s he was  r ecognizable.  And bec aus e he did, and he s aid that, we wer e s aved.
  
We went 
bac k  to m y aunt's  hous e and m ade imm ediate arrangements to leave the next m or ning fir st thing.  
 
 
A s ec ond befor e I get there.  The other  aunt, m y m other's other  s is ter, lives  on the other part 
of town.  We sti
ll had telephones .  We wer e talking with her.  She s ays , 
ﬁW
her e were you
? W
e had 
plans  for the day?
ﬂ
  
I forget what they were.  She s ays , 
ﬁW
ell, two polic emen c am e to my door at 7:30 in 
the m or ning and s aid they had s ome ques tions.  I did what I would normally do.  I invite them
 
in and 
gave them c ake and c offee.
ﬂ
  
When this  aunt gave s om ebody c ake and c offee, and they're people who 
know this  aunt, they would have 17 
c offees
, 19 c akes, and a kitc hen full of dis hes .  
 
>> 
[Laughter]

These gu

a little bit

In any c as e, in any c as e, the next m orning, very ear ly, m y father or der ed a taxi and we went 
to the tr ain s tation to go b
ac k  to Budapest.
  
I need to tell you
, 
for  a kid that age, 5
 
1/2 years  old, the taxi 
was  a great s ur pr is e and a ver y exc iting idea becaus e we got a one
-
hor s e
-
powered taxi.  
 
 
Any idea?  
 
 
It's  a s led.  In Novi Sad in the wintertim e there were taxis  with wheels  and engines  and als o 
s leds  were taxis .  For  a reas on I c an't tell you, the one that showed up, that my father  c alled, on a 
dis patc h, was  a one
-
hor se s led.  Put the s uitcas es in the taxi and took  us  to the train station.  But to me 
the adventure was  the
 
hor s e
 n
ot the rest of the dis as ter that took  plac e the day before

before.

Abs olutely.

how did c irc um stanc es  change s o dr am atic ally onc e they were ther e? 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  There ar e two parts  to that dis c us s ion or that ans wer.  One is  that the allianc e 

between the Germ ans and the Hungar ians  br oke down.  The Ger mans  were no longer  an ally. They 
would oc c upy.  The other s ide, in 1942
 
--
 
again thos e of you going to the museum or have been there, 
you will see an exhibit.  There is  theWars aw Ghetto.  Dir ec tly befor e there is  an exhibit about the
 
Wanns ee Conferenc e.  In 1942, the head of the Nazis  in eas ter n Hungary in Czec hos lovakia, mem bers 
of [Indis c er nible] who was  later as s ass inated in 
P
r ague, c alled a confer enc e for  the purpos e of 
es t
ablis hing the final s olution to the J ewis h pr oblem .  And you know what the final s olution was .  And 
they appointed an offic ial to, in fact, do the mec hanic s  on that final s olution.  The offic ial's  nam e was  
Adolf Eic hm ann.  You r ec all the nam e? 
 
 
Eic hmann comes  to Budapes t the 19th of Mar c h 1944, having s inc e 1942 done all of the other 
c leanout of all of the other countr ies.  Hungary, having been an ally, is the las t to get the benefits  of his  

s er vic es .  He arrives  on the 19th of Marc h.  The depor tations  begin at the rate of 12,000 a day.
 
 
Can I go on to the Kas ztner
 
bus ines s ?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Pleas e.  Yes .

whic h I s aw earlier this  s ummer  bec ause we vis ited there
 
--
 
two men, kind 
of a s elf
-
appointed res c ue c omm ittee, two J ews , ins is t on appr oac hing Eic hm ann.
 
 
Now, ladies  and gentlemen, in a ver y different way, thes e people went to see Eic hm ann muc h 
as  if you went to Rome and s aid
, 
"I wan
t to s ee the Pope."  It's not s om ething you can do.  I'm not 
talking about it's the s ame s ituation but you don't approac h Eic hmann and s ay I ins is t on s eeing him.  
They did.  He rec eived them.  And they dis c us s ed m ethods  by whic h they c ould pos s ibly m ake s
ome 
kind of a deal whic h would benefit both s ides .  
 
 
This  was  the beginning of the deal
 
--
 
Bill m entioned this  ear lier  in the intr oduc tion. If Eic hm ann 
were to tak e one m illion J ews  fr om the available c onc entration c am ps, they would supply him with 
10,000
 
tr uck s  to be us ed agains t the eas tern fr ont.
 
 
Now, there wer e two m ajor pr oblem s with this  propos ition.  One, ther e wer e no m or e million 
J ews  to be had.  Two, thes e guys  didn't have a bic yc le pump
 n
ot 10,000 truc k s .  This  was  all 
phony
-
baloney. 
 
 
One of the two was  s ent to talk  to the Br itis h about tr uck s .  He was  arrested in Syr ia, s pent the 
r es t of the war  in a pris on in Cair o as a s py.  He s ur vived the war but that was  as  far  as he got in 

negotiating for trucks. 
 

 
Thes e negotiations  c ontinued.  The man who s tayed in Budapes t for the negotiations  was  a 
lawyer  by the nam e of Kas ztne

they wound up at the point of the s elec tion in s ome m agic al way of 1,700 people to be put on

port, or a neutral port, in exc hange of whic h Eic hmann and his  cr onies  
would r ec eive s ignific ant, s ignific ant item s to be carr ied in suitc ases.  You c an im agine what they wer e.  

Money was  us eles s .  Unles s  you had Americ an dollar s  or Britis h pound sterling whic h nobody had.  But

jewelry and other  kinds of things of this natur e amas s ed into s ignific ant dollars in thos e days , the

if you r ecall, wher e was  
E

If you believe that, I have s everal more
 
$3 bills  I can give you. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you go on to tell us about that, I was  going to go bac k  and ask you a c ouple
 
of 
other ques tions. 
 
 
Onc e Eic hm ann was  ther e in Mar c h 1944, I think you very quic kly los t your grandparents . 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Well, my gr andparents  lived in Novi Sad, wher e I des cribed, whic h is , as I s ay, 
about four hours s outh of Budapes t.  The grand
par ents were deported as wer e ever ybody els e as  you 
c lean out.  But inter esting, the grandparents  wer e deported with the grandpar ents, the two aunts whos e 
hus bands  wer e already in labor c am p, and the daughter of one of the aunts , my c ous in a year  younger  
t
han I.  They wer e tak en to Aus c hwitz.  And in Aus c hwitz the s elections  took  plac e.  The grandpar ents , 
old, in their ear ly m iddle 60s , and the c hild who was 7 went this  way.  Pr obably dead within two hour s .  

The two aunts, the s isters , went this  way
, w
ent to half a dozen different c am ps , worked like hors es .  But 
they wer e young women, healthy, and they s ur viv ed the war  and died later of var ious  other  c aus es  
having little to do with the s pec ific s of the war . 
 
 
My other grandpar ent, my grandm other , my father 's
 
m other
 
--
 
I told you we wer e on the fifth 
floor of the building.  Air  raids  were onc e or twic e a night.  She had a difficult tim e up and down the 
s tair s.  You c ouldn't us e the elevator.  My father  and his  br other dec ided maybe s he would be better off 
in t
he village wher e they were both bor n.  The village was  a primitive plac e but no air raids.  What ther e 
was , Eic hmann c am e and his  minions  and s he was  deported to Ausc hwitz.  We're not too s ur e
 
--
 
we 
were pr etty s ur e when the other  grandparents  went but not
 
this  one.  My three gr andparents , a bunc h 
of unc les and s o for th went.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you m entioned a little while ago, onc e Eic hmann was  ther e, J ews  were 

deported at the r ate of about 12,000 a day.
 
> > Manny Mandel:  From  Budapest.  Yes.
 
> > Bill 
Bens on:  If I r em ember c orr ec tly, the s peed was  jus t alm ost unimaginable.  I believe within s ix 

weeks  alm ost half a million J ews  wer e depor ted.

, h
ow many tim es  it m ay take to get to 
400,000 whic h is  about the num ber .  Yes. 
 
 
We wer e then, in J uly of 1944, par t of this tr ain.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of the 1,700.
 
> > Manny Mandel:  How we got into it I c an't tell you bec aus e I don't know.  Maybe bec aus e of a 
c er tain pos ition, holdings, or c ertain ec onom y.  But m y m other, and I and my unc le, the youngest unc le, 
were part of the three of the 1,700 or s o people.  But ins tead of being taken to a neutr al por t we wer e 

told we wer e going to stop in this plac e whic h nobody knew, honestly, and I c ertainly didn't k now
, for  a 
three
-
day R & R after  a nine
-
day tr ain r ide befor e we board s hips .  The name of the R & R enc am pment 
was  one c alled Ber gen
-
Bels en.  Bergen
-
Bels en was  not a terminal killing cam p as other s were in 
Poland but it was  a c oncentr ation c am p.  It was  c er tainly a death c amp but not a killing c am p.
  
We wer e 
ther e.  And after s ix weeks after 
additional 
negotiations, about 350 other people of this  gr oup were
, 
in 
fac t, taken by Germ an troop tr ain to Switzer land.  I was n't par t of it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Given you were s o young, do you rem em ber  arr iving at Bergen

Bels en?  Can you tell 
us  anything about what your  time ther e was  like?
  
And for the audienc e mem ber s, they m ay know that 
as  the plac e wher e Anne Frank  died.
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Yes .  I will talk  about that.  I was  not part of the first gr oup.  I s tayed a full s ix 

m onths almost.  I r emember arr iving ther e, stepping out of the boxc ar s  of whic h one you'll s ee upstairs
, 
a
fter nine days . We were in the boxc ar s  for nine days .  This  is J uly. Weather was  good. We c

s leep outs ide under  guard.  But during the day we wer e in the c ar s. We arrived at this platform . We 

9 
 
m ar c hed not a trem endous ly long dis tanc e from the platfor m to our partic ular  barracks.  And we wer e in 
the bar r ack s .
 
 
I'll talk  about life in Bergen

Bels en in a minute.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok . 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  The ac tivities  of the c amp c ons is ted mos t s pec ific ally, 
again
, of a c ens us.  Ever y 
m or ning we wer e told at dawn to be outs ide to be c ounted.  They came to c ount as any time from  5:00, 

6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 9:00, 10:00, or 11:00, whenever their  mood s aid s o

ntil a different officer said 
I

;  
I will be her e at 8:00
 
and you c an c ount on m y punctuality.  I don't c are if you're her e at five 
m inutes befor e 8:00
 
but at 8:00
 
you better be here.
  
We wer e there pr obably at 7:30.  But it was  a m uc h 
better deal to be out 7:30 to 8:00
 
than fr om 4:00
 
to 11:00.  
 
 
Was this  hum anity?  I don't know. Was  it effic ienc y?  I don't know.  But the bottom line was  
we wer e in som e way s aved from c ertain phys ic al kinds  of pr oblems in the Germ an winter whic h was  
r ainy and m is er able and m uddy and s o for th.  That took up m ost of the time.  The r es t of the tim e was  
m ade up
 
--
 
I'll talk  about that later. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was your father with you?
 

> > Manny Mandel:  Nope.  My father was  in labor cam p.

> > Manny Mandel:  Des cr ibed befor e
.  B
y this time he was pr obably in the Ukr aine.  My fath

We reunited.  But he was  not in c am p with us.  Had he been in Budapest, he would have been part of 
the group but he was  not.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Continue telling us  about Bergen
-
Bels en.
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Bergen
-
Bels en was  a c amp that its heyday was  about 25,000 people.  It was  
m os tly a labor and trans it c am p.  In other wor ds , people were br ought
 
in and m oved over to s omeplac e 
els e.
 
 
As  it happened, bec aus e of the s pec ial nature of our  group
 
--
 
r em em ber , we were either  the 
golden eggs or the goose that laid the golden egg.  They wer e s om ewhat m ore gentle with us  becaus e 

they knew if we die, the bargaining pos ition als o dies .  The s uitc as es  full of valuables  wer e not 
deliver ed all at onc e before we left.  They deliver ed dur ing.  They wanted to be s ur e to get whatever the 

whole total am ount would be
.  
So we were in a sens e in reas onably good shape.  The weather  was  
poor .  The c onditions  were poor .  The food was  poor.  But we wer e not being either beaten or s hot 
ever y day.
 
 
You had m entioned Anne Frank .  There's an interes ting kind of emotional connec tion.  You 
r ec all that Anne Frank  was  tur ned in, in Am s terdam , s ent to Aus c hwitz.  And from Aus c hwitz s he was  

s ent to Bergen
-
Bels en
 
ar
r iving there in August
 
1944.  I arr ived in July of 1944.  I was taken out of 
Bergen
-
Bels en in December  of 1944 and s he stayed there until Marc h when s he died, weeks before 
li
beration.
 
 
The reas on I have a c er tain c onnec tion 
Œ 
I 
never knew the woman.  She would have been 
m uc h too old for  me any
how.
  
I was  8.  She was  15.  Old lady.  But the really im portant point is  I had 
this  kind of feeling for  about four m onths we br eathed the s ame air.  She was  ther e.  I was  here.  We 
were in the s ame plac e at the s ame tim e.  I feel a c ertain sens e of kins hip to that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  If you don't mind, tell us about your  unc le who was  ther e with you telling you
 
to
 
get 
your  s hoes  fixed.
 
>> M
anny Mandel:  He got them fixed.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok . 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  European s hoe manufactur ing was  not what it is  today.  You didn't go to a s tore 
and buy a pair of ready
-
m ade s hoes . We didn't.  Shoes  were m ade for you.  And before we left, s inc e 
my
 
par ents  didn't quite k now exac tly wher e, how, and who, they thought a good pair of s hoes would be 
a good idea.  Yes.  So they had m ade for  m e a pair  of kind of 3/4 boots with thick  s oles
.  I
n thos e days  
they would 
s ew 
the s oles on the s hoe and then put dowels  in it, wooden, lik e m atc h s ticks.  You 
knock ed them in ins tead of nails  bec aus e nails  would r us t.  The dowels  if wet would expand and hold 

10
 
 
the s hoes together.  But after  they expanded for days  and hours s tanding in the mud for  thos e 
c ens us es , they fell out.  So the s hoes  par ted this  way.
 
 
Now, you might find it either  amus ing or  str ange that one of the things that happened in 
Bergen
-
Bels en within weeks of our arrival, and I m ean weeks, is busines ses  opened up, bus ines s es
.
  
They were not quite the bus in
es s es  that you folk s  m ight be involved in

ut we had s om e tin c ans with 
us  from whic h we took  food we were told to take along for the r ide.  People m ade jewelr y out of them, 

br ac elets, ear rings , necklac es  whic h they would tr ade for  two c igar ettes , whic h they would trade for a 
hairc ut
, 
whic h they would tr ade for a s hoe r epair .  
 
 
My unc le was  able to talk  to one of his whatever  who, in fac t, was  a c obbler and had tools  with 
him .  Don't ask  m e why or how but he took his tools  with him
, at
 
leas t enough to be
 
able to fix a pair of

m y unc le s aid, 
ﬁW
ell, I got your  s hoes  fixed, kid.  Now s top r unning ar ound.
ﬂ 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Manny Mandel:  I'm 8 years  old.  It was  a bless ing with a double
-
edged s wor d.  I had s hoes  in whic h 
I c ouldn't r un ar ound.  What els e c ould I do? 
 
> > Bill Bens on: While you were there, I believe y ou got ver y ill with pneumonia.  Your m other was  able 
to get s ome c are for  you. 
 
>> 
Manny Mandel:  Well, we had about 35 doctors  in the gr oup.  Only pr oblem is , you know, 
pneumonia is  a bacter ial infection and you c an c ure it with a s hot of 
penic illin
 
or a c ouple of pills .  
Nobody had pills .  
P enicillin
 
had jus t been dis c overed.  We were 
not the firs t to get it.  So pneumonia 
was  a dis ease that was  to be c ured by the body or you died.
  
The other  c onc ern was  they c ould have 
given m e s om e medic ations  but it would have r equired m e to leave the c om pound to go to the post 
hos pital run by the Nazis .  My mother  was  ver y c onc er ned if I ever  were to go ther e, I may never  c om e 

bac k .
  
So I s tayed in the bar r acks.  I was  exc us ed from being outs ide for  the c ens us.  
 
 
And the only thing they could do for  m e was  s omething I will never  forget.  As  a 
pallia
tive
 
form 
of treatment, m ake you feel better  not c ur e you, m ake you feel c omfortable, they wr apped bur lap in 
m us tard s eed oil.  Wher e they got it I
 
don't know.  But it ac ts like Bengay
 
or Vic k 's.  You put it on your  
chest cr oss
-
wis e and heats  the ches t.  It makes you feel better .  It does n't c ure the infec tion but when 
you're br eathing in pneum onia, it makes you feel like you're not going to die every tim e you take a 

br eath.  That was  m y tr eatm ent.  My m other arr anged for that.  Ther e was  nothing els e s he c
ould do.  
That was  pr imitive tr eatm ent of thos e days .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  After about six months  in Bergen
-
Bels en in Dec em ber of 1944, you were s ent to 
Switzer land.  Tell us  about how you got there and what that m eant. 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  We wer e upgr aded fr om
 
c attle c ar s to m ilitary tr ans port c ar s.  But they had s eats  in 
them.  I don't r emember  how long this  was  but I do rem em ber that we went, 1,300 and s ome of us , the 
r em ainder from the 1,700.  We enter ed Switzerland near the German part.  We were taken to th
e 
gym nas ium of a s c hool or s om e large auditorium.  The fir s t thing they did to us  is they dec ided we had 
to be fumigated.  Bec ause the c am p was  full of lic e and ver min of that s or t.  They wer e m uc h too clean 

to perm it that to c om e in s o they fum igated us and then s ent us to the Frenc h part of Switzerland.  
 
 
Thos e of you who know the c ountry, it's  a small countr y.  Above the c ity, near  Geneva, was  a 
lovely vacation hotel, beautiful hotel, that the Red Cr os s had taken over .  It's in a plac e c alled Caux 
wher e
 
they kept us  for sever al weeks , fed us lots of potatoes .
  
We wer e not star ved. We were not the 
s keletons  that you s ee but we all c ould us e a c ouple of pounds .
  
 
 
After that they had to divide us  up bec aus e other  people were c om ing in from var ious  plac es.
  
The Red Cross  had this s ys tem working.  So they had to s end people.
  
There were 20 kids ages 6 to 14 
s lated to go to a c hildren's  hom e.  It's  like a boarding s c hool in the Ger man part, in the Pr ovinc e, in a 

c ity c alled Heiden.  You s aw the pic tur e, my mother , I, s ome of the kids  in the pos ed photogr aph in a 
c ity in Heid
en.  It was  ver y nic e. We lived in like a boar ding sc hool.  
 
 
The reas on my mother  went along
 
--
 
Bill s aid m y m other had been a teac her .  She was .  They 
had to s end s omebody along who, firs t, s poke Hungar ian bec aus e we s poke nothing els e, s poke 

Germ an whic h s he s poke quite well, and had a good am ount of Fr enc h.  Mos t of the staff and mos t of 

11
 
 
the kids ther e were fr om Belgium and Fr anc e. We c ould not s peak  fluent.  We lear ned Germ an but 
ther
e had to be s om ebody who c ould s peak with us  and be the teac her for  kids of age 6 to 14.  People 
knew my mother  had been a teac her.  They s aid, well, s he'll go and s he'll be the c ar etaker , guar dian, 

teac her, whatever  els e.  Whic h m ade it ver y interes ting f or me.  When your  mother  is the teac her, either  
the world is  the best wor ld or the wor s t world. 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Both took  plac e.  If anybody did anything wr ong and the adminis tr ation found out, 

gues s who got a little bit of a 
f
lecking in 
the m orning.  Me.  But it's  s urvival.  That was  not ter rible.  I 
m ade s ome fr iends .  One of thos e kids  I m et m any year s  later on here.  He bec ame a Ric e pr ofes s or at 

the Univer s ity of Mic higan State.  Unfortunately he died of c anc er.  Another one bec am e an
 
Olym pic  
athlete who lives  in Is r ael.  I s aw him this  pas t year.  He becam e an Olympic  wa
lker .  You k now thos e 
guys  who w
addle? 
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Manny Mandel:  That's  what he does.  He's now 79 year s  old and walk s  79
 
kilometers .  Next year  
he's  going to w
alk 80.  He does  this  on his  birthday. 
 
> > B ill B ens on:  Do
 y
ou rec all what the emotions wer e of the adults ?  Here you've been in 
Bergen
-
Bels en a concentration c amp, s egr egated in a s ec tion for you bec aus e of your  s pec ial status  
but nonetheles s , as  you s aid, a c onc entration c amp.  You c ross  the border in Switzerland.  The war  is  

abs olutely s till on.  If you have any s ens e of that, what was  the em otional res pons e?
 
> > Manny Mandel:  I c an des c ribe what I rem em ber  and that s hould give y ou a s ens e of emotional 
differ ence. 
 
 
We arr ived on one s ide of the tr ack s with the Germ an tr oop train, dark, dingy, half the 
windows  s hot out.  I've been told
 
--
 
I don't k now if this  is  acc ur ate
 
--
 t
hat the Germ an gauge of r ailr oads  
is  differ ent than the Swiss .  So the German trains  c ould not run into Switzerland therefore c ould not be 
invaded.  Don't know if that's tr ue but it's a good idea.
 
 
We arr ived on one s ide of the platform from this dingy, dirty, whatever  c ar s
 
and on the other 
s ide of the plat
for m s it
s 
this  big, beautiful, war m , lit Swis s  c ars .  The emotional reac tion was  to go fr om 
this  to that.  It's exemplified to me by the two kinds  of c ars .  That took  us  to Sungala
 
( phonetic )
 
to the 
fumigation, 
 
eventually to Caux and eventually Heiden.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Onc e in Switz
er land and then going on to the home in Heiden, was  your  mother able to 
es tablis h c ontac t with your  father  who I believe was  s till in Budapest at that time?
 
> > Manny Mandel:  My father was  able to get bac k  to Budapest with s ome other  people before the end 
of the war or befor e the Rus s ians  liber ated Budapes t.  The Rus s ian liberation was a pec uliar kind of 

liberation.  It was  a liber ation, yes , and subjugation,
 
yes
,  
at the s am e time.  But he's  back  in Budapes t.  
He is  trying to c ontact us bec aus e the group was  known.  So he was  tr ying to find out. 
 
 W h
en he got back  to Budapes t, we wer e s till in Bergen
-
Bels en.  But my mother and father  
r ec alled or in s ome way that m y father had a c olleague with whom he went to s c hool.  My m other 

c ontac ted this  man who was  able to c ontac t m y father in Budapest not by phone but probably s ome 

kind of c our
ier or c ontac t that
 
had.  He was  living in Switzerland.  He had negotiating pos s ibilities .  My 
m other  didn't. 
 
 
So my mother talks to this
 
--
 
not talks  to but c ontac ts  this  m an, vis ited with him, who was  in 
touc h with m y father , m y father  in touch with him  who was  in touc h with my mother.  So they 

es tablis hed c ontact
.  My
 
m other  was  asked by m y father to c om e back  to Budapes t.  She refus ed.  She 
s aid
, ﬁ
I will never s tep foot in Hungary again.
ﬂ
  
And s he didn't.  She went bac k  to Yugos lavia and other 
plac es  in Europe but not Hungar y for the var ious  reas ons .  We c ontinued what was  our  or iginal 

des tination in Palestine.  We ar rived in Septem ber
 
1945. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: 
 
Was your father with you when y ou arr ived there?
 
> > Manny Mandel:  No.  About a year later.  An entirely differ ent
 
s et of
 
adventur es  having to 
do with the 
imm igr ation bus ines s  he bec am e part of.  He ar rived in Augus t
 
1946.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your father, I think , was  involved in s ome undergr ound activities  befor e the end of the 

war.  Can you s ay a little bit about that?
 

12
 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  How muc h undergr ound I don't know but when he c omes  back
 
--
 
m y father, as I
 
told you ear lier, was  Hungarian.  Spoke the language
 n
ot only m agnific ently but ver y well.  He had an 
ear thy, street Hungarian as  well as  a literary Hungarian. 
 
He was  a s hort, s tocky m an with big 
s houlder s .  He gr ew his  m us tache into 
big 
handle bar m ustac he.  Got himself a sheep sk in coat, the 
s heep skin on the outs ide.  He 
--
 
if you saw his  pic tur e, he's  got a r ound fac e.  He c ould eas ily pas s  for 
a native Hung
arian. 
 A
s a c ons equenc e he took  the r isk  of walking
 
s tr eets and bec am e a
 
c our ier  
between the Swedis h litigation,Wallenberg active, the Swis s  Hous e, the em bas s y or the c entr al 
loc ation of the c hurc h, and he bec am e a r unner in between.  Had he been c aught 
anywher e
, 
he would 
have been s hot in the street.  He was able to get away.  That was  his  c onnec tion to the underground.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ser ving 
as  
a runner, c ourier.
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Between the plac es .  Right.  This  is  the ghetto in Budapes t.  He was  on
ly there for 
s ix weeks .  Our apartment apparently was  ther e.  It had had s om e bomb dam age but nothing s er ious .  
So that's what he did until he was  able to find s ome way to begin to leave Hungar y to, in fac t, alm os t 
liter ally walk to Italy to one of thos e ships  that becam e the illegal s hips , whic h is  a whole differ ent stor y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It's quite a story, as a m atter of fac t. When your father finally ar rives  in Pales tine in 

1946, how did you get from  ther e to the United States ?  What c aus ed that to ha
ppen?
 
> > Manny Mandel:  Well, we were ver y happy ther e.  My father had a s is ter .  There were s even of them 

or iginally.  Two of the wom en died in the 30s  of var ious  c aus es.  Thr ee of the br other s
 
--
 
two of the 
br others  died in labor c am p.  The youngest br other , the one I s pok e about befor e, dr opped dead, 
eventually, in 1948. We were s till there.  He died after we left.  But my father had a s ister in 
Philadelphia.  She was  dis patc hed to Philadelphia in 1914 to r educ e the bur den on my gr andfather's 
inability 
to feed the family.  She c am e to Philadelphia to a cous in.  She stayed in Philadelphia, becam e 
a cigar  m aker , m et a c igar  m aker whom s he mar ried.  They had thr ee c hildren.  They lived a nic e, long 
life in Philadelphia. 
 
 
My father hadn't s een his s is ter for 40 years.  He wanted to c om e to the s tates
, to
 
vis it with my 
Aunt Helen.  As he c ame her e thr ough a s eries of c ir c
um stanc es he found that m aybe he c ould 
s ec ure 
a pos ition her e whic h might be a pos ition that's a more liking to him and more s ucc es sful than the one 
he had in Is r ael.
  
He wrote us  and s aid
 
--
 
he c ame in 
`
48.  In 
`
49 we c ame.  That's  how we c am e.  
People s aid, how did you get here?  I s aid
, ﬁW

ﬂ 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Unus ual.

Cons tellation, for you aeronautic  fans , a Howard Hughes C

, 
a beautiful plane. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think we have tim e to tur n to our audienc e for  ques tions.  What I'm going to ask
 
--
 
if 
you have a
 
question, pleas e rais e your hand. We'll get a m ic r ophone to you.  We'll have mic s  on either

Let's s ee.  You have one back there, Clara?  Ok .  Thank  you.

When your  dad was  gone, did you m is s  him ?

--
 
to the point 
that m y daughter's  brother  is  named David
 
--
 
m y wife and I dec ided if we have a s on, we will give him  
the nam e David.  We were not going to give my daughter the nam e Davida or s omething like that.  But 
we had a s on David.  He was  c lose to me for  a long tim e bec aus e m y father  was n't ar ound.  And David 
was

you don't mis s  it. 
 
 
My father from 1946 on and I s aw eac h other  all the time.  We got r eacquainted.  I no longer

The fumigation s ounds  s c ar y.  Can you elaborate about that, how long it took , what was  involved in

What did that mean?

What happened to your Un

be wer e to be m ar r ied.  They had papers.  They just hadn't yet gone and done the c er emony.  
She was  depor ted to Aus c hwitz.  David was  with us .  But as luck  would have it and as life is  m uc h 

s tr anger than fic tion, they both m ade it to Pales tine.  And they m arr ied.  And they had a s et of twins .  

And he got the job as  a teac her
 
in
 
one of the fines t high s c ho

at
 
the age 
of 34 or 35 or  som ething like that

>> 
Thank you for  s har ing your  s tory.  You mentioned that you used to have a yellow
 
--
 
us ed to wear a 
yellow s tar .  I wonder , is  that your firs t r ec ognition that you wer e being treated differently?  If not, what 

14
 
 
was  your  r ealization that, hey, I'm being tr eated, me, other s  like m e, politic ally, r eligious ly, ethnic ally, 
whatever  the c ase m ay
 
be wer e being tr eated differ ently than others ? 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  I would think that the yellow s tar m ay have, in fact, been the first of thos e whic h I 

thought was  a m atter  of pride and I lear ned it was n't.  It was  the first vis ual, you know, kind of c ons
c ious  
way of being told.  Bec aus e prior to that the c ity of Budapest was  20%, 25% Jewis h.  My life was  

am ong the c omm unity in whic h I lived.  I had no inter action nor des ir ed inter ac tion with 

anybody
 
--
 
although, you may r ec all I s aid on the s am e floor wher e I lived, r ight next door to us  on the 
r ight side was  a family with two girls , one older than I, one younger.  Both went to Catholic  sc hool.  But 

our  buddys hip was  not affec ted by that.  
 
 
So the fir st s ign that I was  differ ent
 
--
 
and they didn't give a 
hoot if I wor e a yellow s tar  or not.  
They were my fr iends .  I was  their fr iend.  We played together, whatever the hell 6
-
year
-
olds  do, we did.  
I don't think  I want to mention.  But whatever.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Manny Mandel:  In any c as e, yes , I think that
 
would be 
the 
first point that I c ould think back and 
c ons c ious ly rec all that as a, hey, you're differ ent, we are making you different. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'r e at the end of our  progr am.  As  Manny s aid, I'm going to tur n back  to him for what 
we c all the las t wor d.  It is  our tradition that the Firs t Per s on has the las t word.
 
 
Befor e I do that, I 
want to note that ther e wer e s everal folks who had questions  we didn't get 
to. When Manny's  finis hed, he's  going to s tay up here on the s tage.  So we invite you to
 
c ome up and 
talk  to him if you have a question to ask  him.  That's an oppor tunity.  Or if nothing els e, just to s hak e 
Manny's  hand or get your  photogr aph taken with him  if you want. We'll have that opportunity when he 
finis hes.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being her e.  I r emind you that we have

On that note, I will tur n it over  to Manny.
