people from 
White Russia
, and when I told them that I know 
Nesvizh
 they were 
very excited and they  send me photographs of
 Nesvizh, 
how 
Nesvizh
 looks now. 
And they called 
Nesvizh
 the pearl of 
White Russia. 
Q: And why is it so? Why Œ why is 
Nesvizh 
so special?  
A: I think that mostly than
ks to the family of the 
Radziwells,
 because they heard in 
Nesvizh
 there might be a big palace. I don™t know if there is a second su ch in th e 
former 
Poland
. And around the palace was a beautiful park. And the Catholic 
priests brought Italian artists, 
who painted the churches in  
Nesvizh. 
So, it was a 
small town, but some very excellent in arch
itecture, in culture, and in Jewish life, 
too. 

Q: In what way Œ what was 
special in Jewish life in 
Nesvizh
? 
A: In Jewish life, the most of
 the people were intelligentsia.

A: Because in
 Iwje
 she had enough patients, and Œ 
Q: It was okay. 
A: Œ it was easier than in 
Vilnius
. 
Q: What happened to  her? 

A: She was killed by the Germans. I re
ceived a letter from a Jewish doctor 
Melamed
(ph) from
 Iwje
, and he wrote, kill the Germans, kill the Germans. Your 
mother, together with othe
r intelligentsia went to someplace Œ I don™t remember 
what is the name of the place Œ and was executed. 

Q: Where were you when yo

A: In
 Leningra d
 all the time. 
Q: In aw Œ in
 Leningra d
 the whole time. 
A: Yeah, all the time. All 
the time of the blockade. 
Q: So were Œ this was Œ you go

A: It was already the blockade, because when  the Reds came to

Q: Œ it got ex Œ yeah, it got extended.  
A: Finished, miss 
Poland. 
Q: Now, here™s a question. You mentioned your father was the head of the Zionists 
in 
Vilnius. 
A: Yes. 
Q: As you were growing up, 
in your ch ildhood, in your 
Œ in your teenage years, did 
you have any political intere
sts at all? Were you inte
rested in politics? Did you 
identify yourself to a
ny particular group? 
A: My beloved 
organization was 
Hashomer Hatzair. 
From
 Hashomer Hatzair
, 
mo st o f  th e 
Shomerim 
took part in every fight against 
Hitler
. And how you see on 
many of the photographs, I am with the 
Hash omer. 
This is my political 
organization. 

Q: Tell us Œ tell us a little bit more about 
these organizations, so
 that people who are 
listening to this in the future 
would understand wh at they were. 
A: 
Hash omer Hatzair
 was beloved by my  father beca
use he was a Zionist, and th is 
was the mo st developed youth organi
zation fo r Zionists. So he loved 
Ha sho mer 
Hatzair
. And he told my mother
 that it is a good place for your son to be a 
Shomer.

First she said, ah, I don™t know
 wh at kind of youth is ther
e, that is different youth, 
good and bad and all that. But when he told  her, she took it Œ 
Q: Seriously. 
A: Yes. And I was very close to 
Hashomer Hatzair
 because my father was the 
head of the Zionist organization. 
Q: Did you have any other close relatives
 as you were growing up, with you? To 
me, I get the impression that it was only 
your mother and yourself, as a team. 
You™re the geographer, she™
s the dentist. Were there any other people who were 

close to you at those years? 

A: I will tell you, there is, in my biograp hy a lot of details. But I will repeat the 
most important. My mother™s sister
, Mina
(ph) was a massage-ist i n  the 
Druskininka i
. That™s why almost every 
year I am comin g  to the
 Druskininkai
 for 
two weeks, and I see some of the forest ther
e, and for me is a great, tragic pleasure 
to see it. So, I went to the cemet
ery of people who were killed in 
Druskininkai
. 
Most of the people were Russians, 
and there was written their military Œ 
Q: Rank. 
A: Yes. And they saw that some other ma
n is going on the same  cemetery and is Œ 
he reads the inscriptions on
 the mo numents. Well, I began to speak with him and he 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski

said that yes, I am from
 Druskininkai
. I was a partisan  against 
Hitler.
 All the Jews 
from
 Druskininkai
 were taken to 
Gro dno
 and ex ecuted. 
Q: That would mean your aunt as well. 
A: And among them was my mother™s si ster,  t h e massage -ist, 
Mina
(ph). In 
Nesvizh
 
my  mo ther had a brother, 
Za h a r
(ph). 
Za h a r
(ph) was killed in 
Nesvizh
 very fast, 
because the Germans had the impression that 
his son has sympathies for leftist. So 
he was executed almost immediately,
 maybe the second or third day in
 Nesvizh
. He 
was a composer, and I have probab ly here 
some notes that he composed. And so me 
of his songs, I know from my memory, and I 
would want to Œ to Œ to  make some Œ 
some use of that.
 
Q: Could you sing somethi
ng? Would you mind singing on
e of those songs? Do you 
mind singing one of them right now? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Please? 
A: Not th e easiest songs. 
Q: Okay . 

A: The texts are Polish.

A: It™s understandable.

Q: Thank you, thank you, I know it™s not 
easy. But we care ve
ry much about the 
music that people created. An
d when Œ this is the music 
of the boy who was killed, 
then, almost immediately. 
A: It was the 
[indecipherable]
 killed. His name is
 Salomone
(ph)
 Za r h e
(ph). 
Q: 
Salo mone
(ph)
 Za r h e
(ph).
 
A: Yes, 
Salo mone
(ph)
 Za r h e
(ph). 
Salomone
(ph), we called him 
Moniek
(ph). 
Q: 
Moniek
(ph). 
A: 
Moniek
(ph) 
Za r h e
(ph). Everybody knew
 him, because in 
Nesvizh
 he was the 
director of a dancing 
and singing ensemb le. 

Q: When  did you Œ when you fo und Œ do 
you rememb er when 
you found out about 
these different things? Was it when you were in

your mo ther. I me an, your mo th er is, you 
got th e letter, but the other people who 
were close to you and dear to you, wh
en did you find out about th eir fate? 
A: Something I found from letters, like Dr. 
Melamud™s
(ph) son from 
[indecipherable]
. Somebody I found in 
Druskininkai
 already lately Œ 
Q: Mm-hm, recently. 

A: Yes, that they saw that a
ll the Jews were executed in 
Gro dno . 
From many 
people, I know who survived 
Nesvizh.
 For instance, I write to 
Isr ael
, to a very old 
friend. The old friend fought with me under 
Lening ra d
, against
 Hitler
, but I didn™t 
know about it, because under
 Leningra d
 you had a half m
illion soldiers, wh-wh-
who knows? And this was the photograph of the 
Radziwells
. His father was 
photographing everything what ha
ppens in the palace of the 
Radziwells
.  
Q: I see. 

A: And the
 Radziwells
 was not simple 
youks
, but they had people in the royal 
family of 
Poland
. 
Q: Yes. 
A: So it was a very special 
family. For instance, around
 Nesv izh
 they had over a 
million hectares of ground, except the pala
ce, with the park, w
ith everything. Now, 
from 
Nesvizh Œ 
so, I receive letters un til now from the friend from
 Israel.
 He was 
very hard Œ

Q: Wounded, or something? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Wounded, was he wo unded, did he have in juries? 
A: He Œ he Œ he couldn™t wa
lk, al-al-al-almost Œ almost he couldn™t. His wife died a 
short time ago, she was a survivor from
 Romania
. So, from him I know a lot. A lot 
I know from the book, from Dr. 
Shalom Ch olawsky. 
Dr. 
Shalom Cholawsky
 
wrote about Jewish partisans who fought ag ainst 
Hitler
. And he was one of the 
heads of the Jewish partisans. And he™s Œ 
here is his photograph with his rifle. Dr. 
Shalom Ch olawsky.
 So, from such Œ 
Q: Sources. 

A: Œ sources, I know something. 
Q: So, let™s go back now to
 Leningrad
. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And tell us Œ tell me about what was your experience there. What was it like to 
be in the siege of 
Leningra d
? What kind of fighting happened ? 
A: You have to take 
[indeciphera ble]
 something, that™s my
 mother finished a 
Russian high school, and 
a Russian university in 
Kharkov,
 in
 Ukraine. 
And 
Russian, she said to everybody that 
Russia
 is my  homeland. So I had some 
sentiments to Ru
ssian culture, to 
Tolstoy,
 to Œ to 
Chekhov. 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski  
November 24, 2009 

 

 
 
29
Q: Of course. 
A: It is under-understandable. So, when 
I came to the Russian army , I found people 
who speak almost so well, how I 
am speaking Russian. And born in  
Nikopol™
, so it 
is 
Russia
. So, to en Œ together I am theirs
, y ou know. So I ha
ve very strong 
sentiments to Russiancultu
re, to the Russian people , but not to the Russian 
[indecipherable]
. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: Because politics are very different, with
 a lot of facts, subjective facts. The 
Polish look different today, different they lo
oked 15 years ago, so
 I try to be very 
neutral, and my politics is the politics of
 America
. 
Q: But in 
Leningra d
 in 1941, that™s the story I wa
nt to capture. Of a young man 
who™s 20 years old, or 19 years old, w
ho™s in the Soviet army , and li Œ and you 
know, it™s hard time. I want to 
learn about what that was like. 
A: Yes. In the gymnasium of 
Slovatski
(ph) in 
Vilnius
 was a 
legya
(ph), 
legya
(ph), a 
legion of young people who had a military tr
aining. But not all the Jews were there. 
Some, if they were 
[indecipherable]
 but if they were young 
[indecipherable]
. 
When they came to the Red Ar
my , it was a training shooting. And I shot three times 
and I make 29 points. 
Q: Is that good or bad? I have no idea. 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski  
November 24, 2009 

 

 
 
30
A: It is a very high result. 
Q: So th at means you™re a good marksman. 

A: Yes. A man who speaks Russian
, and who shoots 29 from 30 possible 
theoretically Œ 

Q: Points.  

A: Oh, okay. It was anothe
r training, who will put his 
gasmask faster than any 
other. So  many made it in five seconds, in 
seven seconds. I made in one second and 
four. Ay. So they gave me on a good artille
ry position, thanks which I don™t hear 
you too well. 

Q: If you had gotten 20, and not 30 - 29, ma
ybe you™d hear me better, is that what 
you™re saying? 

A: Probably , probably. Or not Œ 

Q: Or not. 

A: Œ or not. 
Q: You never, never know. 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: So, you were in the artillery, 
so  that means front line, yes? 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski  
November 24, 2009 

 

 
 
31
A: So, it was artillery against German bom
bers. And sometimes we shoot well, and 
sometimes we shoot very badly.
 The first day, we shoot in
 Œ in Œ in a Russian plane 
by mistake. 
Q: It happens. 
A: It is different, you k
now. And when the Russians, 
at whom we shoot, found 
themselves a piece of a forest and were hidi
ng, so we gave a commander to Œ to Œ to 
shot better. And they came to the 
[indecipherable]
 to our battery, and they said, no 
more planes.  

Q: Good that they surviv
ed. At least that much. 
A: So, was th-the Œ the begin of our great
 training. Bu t, because we shot bombers, 
the head of our unit said, we
 anti-aviation artillery-ists, w e are living a long time, so 
he said. Because, you know, they bombard  
a factory, and they don™t look on the 
battery of artilleries, th ey don™t need a batte
ry of artilleries, they 
need a Œ to destroy 
the factory, or to destroy the civilian p
opulation in this city, on the market or 
something. So, the Œ the head 
of the unit told the truth. I think that he is still alive. 
Q: Did you eat well during the siege? 

A: This was the most terrible thing. At home I 
weig hted
 66 kilograms. In the army, 
I 
weig hted
 39 - 37. I looked mo re like a dead ma
n. The hunger was terrible. It is 
terrible. It is weeks and weeks and mont
hs and months, almo st nothing eating. I

have an ex cellent book, he has the book, wh
ere the author wrote the true face of the 
blockade of 
[indecipherable]
. It is the one book where th
ere is no subjective to Œ to 
much moments. He wrote how it was, ever
ything. It is Œ it is terrible. You are 
walking thro ugh the streets and you are s
eeing dozens of dying people. This author 
said that in the hunger in
 Leningra d
 died one million popula
tion. One million; not 
military, civil population. And 
he said that the history 
doesn™t know a second such 
case that 900 days you 
don™t give up, and 
Hitler
 can™t take 
Leningra d
. The 
marshals of 
Hitler
 came close the gates of the city, 
and they brought even stones to 
build  a monument for
 Hitler
, for their fuehrer. And we 
did, 20 years old guys, we 
said no. No. Ended. No  was true. 
Q: No stones for Œ yes. So wh at was it that you did eat? What was it that you did 
eat? 

Q: This author wrote exactly, I will tell you 
for an example. 15 grams sugar, it is not 
a full teasp o on. Around 20 pounds fat, but w
ho knows what kind of fat it  is? F rom a 
dog, or from a Œ from a cow? Who Œ who 
Œ who knows what it is? No bread, but 
instead of bread, 
sukardi
(ph). It™s made Œ it means piec
es of bread baked on Œ on Œ 
on fire, you know. So people sa
id that the material for th e 
Œ for the bread is the rest 
from food for horses, for ca
valry. But the horses died 
from hunger a long time ago, 
and they  make Œ made bread for th e population. What is there mo re? 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski

33
Q: I™m tal Œ but you, is there something 
you remember eating? This is the same 
thing Œ 
A: This is Œ this was my Œ my eating, but
 it came a better time, as they send my unit 
to the lake of 
La do ga . 
Q: Where is that? 

A: 
Ladoga 
is the largest lake in 
Europe. 
It is between Finland and between Ru ssia. 
The Finnish said that all 
Ladoga
 has to belong to  them, and the Russians say that 
all
 Ladoga 
has to belong to the Russians. On the 
Ladoga
 were points where trucks 
winter were going thro ugh the snow and th e ice, through the 
La dog a
, through the Œ 
with some food. And we didn™t have a lot wo
rk to fight to the Germans, so we had 
enough time to help the civil population. So, we could Œ 

Q: Get some food. 

A: Œ something wh at fell on the Œ on th e gr
ound, or something to Œ but to take 
something from a truck, dead. Ever
ybody knew, don™t touch it. The 
Ladoga
 has 42 
kilometers, such trees were 
from a Œ one side were the Finns, and on th e other side 

the Russians. 

Q: And were you shooting at 
each other at that time, the 
Finns and the Russians, or 
not? 

A: What? 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski  
November 24, 2009 

 

 
 
34
Q: At that time, when you were in 
Ladoga
, were the Finns shooting at the Russians 
or not, and the Russian
s shooting at the Finns? 
A: I would say that the Finns
 wanted to look mo re gen
tlemen than the Germans. I 
feel so, that they threw le
ss shells on the Russian terr
itora Œ territory than the 
Germans. I have a such feeling, because in 
Leningra d
 was inscriptions on th e 
walls, where is safer to  Œ to walk. So, if 
you look what is written, it is written so, 
like most of the shells
 would co me from the 
dort Œ 
from the Finns. Less from the 
Finns and mo re from the south. 
Q: From the Germans. 

A: From the Germans. I have a such impr
ession. And the author
 of the book writes 
that the dictator of 
Finland
 was a administered by the tsar in 
Russia.
 So, he even 
told Œ maybe it is a fantasy, but he toldthe Finnish army  that he was the dictator, 

but don™t touch 
[indecipherable]
. 
Q: Ah. 
A: So, it was some easier situatio n. 
Q: How long were you there, at Lake
 La do ga
? 
A: A winter of minus 
40 Celsius, minus 47. 
Q: Oh yay, oh yay. 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski  
November 24, 2009 

 

 
 
35
A: That™s why I pray from Œ for 
Roosevelt.
 He gave us warm shoes. It was more 
important than anything else. 
Churchill 
didn™t do it, but 
Roosevelt.
 So, with the 
good shoes, we ate a little more, and so
meday I was taken, togeth er with 15 Œ 16 
other Po lish Jews, and sent back to th
e city to Œ sent to the city of 
Lening ra d
 back. 
I came back, it was after a winter of
 La do ga
, I came back to a reserve unit, and the 
reserve unit, some people 
who didn™t like too mu ch 
amho Œ 
too much Jewish 
people. Ah, they are all Polish, send them to 
Poland
 back. We™re organizing a 
Polish army, a leftist army. So
, in the reserve unit I was taken to, after a winter of 
Ladoga
, and I came to the Polish army, and in
 the Polish army  I fought in many 
places. 
Q: Such as? 
A: In such places like Œ I didn™t sleep too much. 
Schneidemühl. 
Q: Was that already east 
Russia
? 
A: 
Schneidemühl
, it is in western 
Pomerania
. It is the western part of today™s 
Pola nd . 
Q: Yes. 
A: On th e
 Baltic
 Sea. So, the Germans, 
when we was closer to
 Berlin
, being 
stronger and stronger, and they  took already 
all the people to the army  an-and Œ and 
too young, and too old, a
nd too Œ everybody understo
od that the end will come.

Now, and with the Polish army, 
I took part in the fight for
 Warsaw
, until ™45, May 
two, I fought in 
Berlin. 
Q: Wow. 
A: Yes. 
Q: What are your memories from there? 

A: Mm? 

Q: What can you tell us about your experience there? 
A: The Germans had a very strong disciplin
e in the army. Very 
strong discipline. 
And the 
Hitler
 youth organization elevated them
, the young people was tigers. 
Young girls 14 years old, were standing 
in  the windows and shooting into  the 
Soviet tanks. But 
Zhukov
 had this time more force, 
more planes, more artillery . I 
was an inspector over in the Œ in the army
, so I was sent to different units, and 
among th e units were such shells and artillery
, that when you s Œ closing to the Œ to 
the gun, it was a hundred thun-thunders,
 not one thunder, a hundred thunders. 
That™s wh y my  hearing is a such one, but 
when I was still young, it was okay. When  
I became very old, is not okay. 
Q: Tell me, the Soviet army Œ you were in
 the Polish army, not the Soviet army. But 
the Soviet army  did not have the best re
putation as it went westwards, dif Œ firing 

on th e retreating Germans. And the bad 
reputation was generally borne by the 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski

37
female civilian population. The Soviet 
army had a reputation of raping its way 
westwards to 
Berlin.
 Do you know, did y
ou see any of that? 
A: I saw many such cases. 
In comparison with what 
Hitler
 did in one 
White 
Russia
, can you forget about everything 
else? Because they didn™t leave
 White 
Russia
 at all. No one house was in Œ in a 
normal shape. Noth ing was. It Œ it was 
Sahara .
 So, to Œ to compare if a young Russian 
tried something, yes, it is very bad, 
sure, sure. And 
Zhukov
 gave very hard penalties fo
r such things, very hard 
penalties. The head of our unit and Soviet 
chemical specialist ha
d something to do 
in 
Warsaw
. In 
Poland
 the Œ they behaved a lo t better than in other places. So he 
got three months in a Œ i-i-in a special Œ 
Q: Prison? 
A: In a special unit. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Where th e unit was all the times sent on the front, you know. And he came Œ 
came alive. It i Œ it is Œ it is a Œ a very
 big problem, but ev
ery war brings true 
crimes. Every war. 
Q: Did you, as you were Œ 
before you went into the 
Po lish army , or as you were 
going westwards, di
d you go th rough 
Bela rus
, did you see 
Nesvizh
? Did you see 
anything of your former life wh
ile you were still in the army? 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski

38
A: When I was in the army, I didn™t se
e exactly the places where I was before, 
because w-we went around 
Wa rsa w
 and from
 Warsaw
 in 
Pomerania
, close to the 
Baltic
 Sea, I was never there before. So, I can
 tell only like about this author of the 
book, and about Ru ssian people, who to
ld me what there was. In Œ in 
White 
Russia
, if a Jewish partisan was caught, th
ey killed all the village, burned all the 
village, and their pro-pro-pro-pro-pro acquaint
ance were killed. It is impossible to d 
Œ to describe. One word, and you 
perished, you know. And I saw in 
White Russia
 
[indecipherable]
 I didn™t leave any, but 
[indecipherable]
 didn™t exist. Didn™t exist 
absolutely.  

Q: Yeah, I know.  
A: And, when after the discipline, the Ge
rman discipline finish
ed, oh, we like every

 I wa Œ I was one moment the commander of the first Polish army, 
send me to find Greek prisoners. Where to
 look for them? Nob
ody knows. Okay, 
bu-bu-but Œ 

Q: Where were you Œ wher
e were you? Were you in

 then, or in Œ 
A: It finished the war, maybe 
a week after finishing the war. 
Q: And you were in

? The week after you finish

Q: Oh, let™s Œ oh, but Œ but if you were in

I was just trying to get a sense of where

A: Na Œ here is
 Berlin. 
Q: Yeah, yes, I know. I don™t have

under the pressure of the American

 there. Okay. So I 
told in Greek to 
Mita la s

The Iliad

Homer?  
He said, now is a big difference in 
the Greek pronunciation and Greek spelling,
 and I don™t know it, he said. Ancient 
Greek, wh o knows Œ knows? Only  a great ar

Q: Did you ever go back to
 Nesvizh 
after the war? 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski

46
A: No, my friend, but I have with 
Nesvizh 
very strong contacts. Dr. 
Cholawksy
, 
and one of the main workers 
in the Œ the Hebrew organization. An  organization who 
has to do with 
the Holocaust Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ is there, from
 Nesvizh
. And another 
schlar
(ph) was in gymnasium in 
Nesvizh 
together with me. 

Q: Did you Œ I guess my  larger question is
, did you go back to 
any of the places, 
whether it was 
Wilno
, whether it was 
Nesvizh,
 whether it was the various towns 
you had been with your mo
ther, after the war, to s
ee what they looked like? 
A: In general, not. But I was close to 
Ponary
, and 
Pona ry
 is a station close to
 
Landwarów
. 
Q: 
Lentvaris. 
A: 
Ponary
 is from 
Vilnius
 nine kilometers, and 
Landwa rów
, 18. How they  say in 
rail line. So, in 
Ponary,
 the mo st Œ you can™t imagine what talents were destroyed. 
Poets and writers, and Œ and Œ an
d Œ and Œ it i Œ it is impossible to Œ to Œ to  Œ to  Œ to 
imagine. It is the Œ the grain 
of th e Jewish family, you know. 
Q: And you saw it right after the war? 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski  
November 24, 2009 

 

 
 
47
A: Yes, yes, yes. And when I go to 
Druskininkai
, 
Vilnius
 was the Œ 
[indecipherable]
 in 
Vilnius
 were destroyed by General 
Chernikowski
(ph). 
Chernikowski™s
(ph) a Jewish guy. 
Q: Oh. 
A: Yeah. Bu t this is not the Œ the 
Œ the clue, you know. So , I came to 
Vilnius
 six, 
seven years ago, 
Chernikowski™s
(ph)
 
monument, hoo, and another monument is 
there. I go 
[indeciphera ble]
 but wh at is Œ what kind of ornament is it? On the street 
Mickiewicza
 is Œ on the wall of the court before the war in Œ in 
Viln ius,
 the Polish 
court, are names of young people who were 
killed. By whom they  were killed, what 
is it? And the Jewish guy explained me, that
 the Lithuanians said 
that the Jews were 
criminals. That they kille
d the Lithuanians because th
e Lithuanians were Soviet 
spies. But I imagine that when
 the Polish Jewish Jews in 
Vilnius
 came back to their 
houses, and they knew fro
m the population, from Œ from many other sources, who 
was the real spies for 
Hitler
, they came to the Soviets, 
and the Soviets do what with 
the young, what they could do
 with somebody else. Or t h
ey could do 
with Œ with 
Russians, who were under such 
suspicion, you know. So, in 
Vilnius
 in 
[indecipherable]
 city on the street 
Mickiewicza
 is a such mo nument. So, you 
know, how controversial all Œ 
all that is, you know. How Œ

Q: When  did you find out Œ you see, when 
you were talking to me before about how 
Belarus
 was no more, that it was a 
Sahara
, that could be Œ that Œ that shows 
German brutality, Nazi brutality, collaborat
or brutality in war
time. When did you 
learn that there was something particular
? When did you learn of the Holocaust? 
When did you first see the results that th
is was against the Jews, that this was a 
genocide? 

A: Okay, I am very glad that you ar
e asking about that. I™m very glad. The 
Holocaust was in several act s. Someti mes 
very late, and sometim
es immediate. The 
immediate are 
Pona ry
, the 
Jerusalem
 of
 Lithuania
. The immediate was
 Nesvizh, 
because in 
Nesvizh
 was a very hard Jewish co mmunity. An intelligent Jewish 
community in
 Nesvizh. 
And in 
Nesvizh
 they collected all the population on the 
market, maybe two weeks after 
[indecipherable]
 
Nesvizh
, and they killed 
everybody. There is maybe 
Œ maybe 10 people were Œ 
Q :  S u rv iv ed . 
A: Survived. And the White 
Russian peasantry was a lot more sympathetic to Jews 
than Polish. So, is it Œ so th
ey destroyed almo st all the 
Nesvizh
 community. And in 
one en try of a Œ of a very poor house in 
Nesvizh,
 stood a lady and took a girl from 
the Œ 

Q: Line? 

 
Interview with Norbert Krasnosielski

A: Œ from the thousands who 
were pushed like animals to 
[indecipherable]
 you 
know. And the girl was saved by the 
lady who took her. And 
she was married by 
my  friend who is 
Yad Vashem ,
 who is working there. An
d thanks her, he is still 
alive. He is over 90. 
Q: Oh my, oh my. 

A: Yes.  

Q: But my  question is again, a personal 
question. Wh en  did you personally, where 
were you when you realized that this 
was a genocide against 
the Jews? When did 
you find out, when did you re
alize this was not just war, and horrible war, but this 
was also a genocide? 
A: First I have small signals. In the Soviet 
press, in the military Soviet press, a little 
about. And I slept with a Jewish guy, 
Schlitzer
(ph) was his name. And 
Schlitzer
 
shed Œ said, do you know th
at the Germans are killing all the Jews? I was very 
careful. All the Jews? Yes, all the Jews. Ye
s, I believe. I believe that they could it 
do, because I am from a clas
sical gymnasium, and I know 
that the Latin poets said, 
horro r 
Germ anicus
(ph)
. 
That the main feelings in 
Germany
 is horror 
Germanicus
(ph). The Belgians are very nice 
people, but the Germans are a horror. 
Two thousand years write a Latin words that
 the main characteristic of Germans is 
horro r.

Q: Why were you careful around him, or 
why were you careful 
when he said that? 
A: I told you yes, it is possible. It is po
ssible. And it was finished, the dispute. If he 
was a 
schmekel
, so he told somebody else about
 speaking with me. He was not a 
schmekel
, so I told him the truth. It was the first 
klagator
(ph). 
Q: Yeah, the first notes. 
A: But when  I heard more and more a
bout that, and people are Œ are writing fu ll 

pages and all that? Hey. So it is absolutely
 true. And when I ber 
Œ began to get news 
from Dr. 
Cholawsky
, and news from the guy whose wife
 saves him, his life, and all 
that. So naturally it is
 absolutely true, and th e news 
were brighter and brighter and 
brighter. And I came to 
Druskininkai
, and from 
Nesvizh
 people told me that 6,000 
Jews in 
Nesvizh
 were killed. It means hundred percent. 
Q: Again, you learned that 
recently, you say, and I™m interested in after the war. 
Did you, in 
Kato wice
, when  you met your future wife
, did you already have an  idea 
that this Œ that this was comple
te, that this was a full genocide? 
A: In time of war? 
Q: Right after the war, yeah. 

A: Or Œ immediately after the war? 
Q: Yeah.

of all the Polish intelligentsia. And all the professors of 
Jagiellonian

was on the conference, and immediately 
after the conference, they were to
 
Sach senhausen. 
And he is sitting there because he was Œ

A: O-O-O-On th e Œ on the conferen ce. 
Q: That™s the scene, I don™t know if you seen the movie, ﬁ

 You should see

in the film of professors from

then being arrested and taken to

So I Œ when I saw it, I did not

you introduced into a film. And your gran

my Œ my mother™s brother was shot. His wife

 Mo n iek
 the composer was shot. So, this is
 the most terrible memories, w h en 
has come the moment and I see my moth

Well, a patient was coming to her, 
and the patient was a poor man. I

from gymnasium still, and she wrote letters to me and Œ okay. The 
United States
 
has an 
[indecipherable]
 of a demo cratic country. And 
Roosevelt 
was a super 
intelligent man. He was sick, he couldn™t 
do everything what he
 would do. But you 
can imagine what is it to defend
 Moscow
 
[indeciphera ble]

raw materials, and a lot of ships were 
destroyed by th e Germ
ans. And we™re going 
to 
[indecipherable]
 I know that 
America
 has for me an opinion of a truly 
democratic country. Okay, we
 will try. And I was happy th
at they Œ a moment that 
they will send and push 
with their leg, the Œthe Jewish from Œ from
 Pola nd
. And 
especially who had military jobs and all Œ all Œ all that, or professors or something. 

And I went to a guy in 
Warsaw
, connected with the police probably. And they  had 
the anti-Semites, an opinion that every 
Jew has diamonds in Œ in his pockets. 
Noth ing else. No diamonds. Do  you have

Rome. 
In
 Rome
 are bureaucrats who help the Jews to make all the formalities 
better and Œ and faster, and Œ 
Ro me
? I am a classic. Why not? We went to 
Ro me
 
and we were there a half year, in 
Rome.

 America
? I laughed,

[indecipherable]
 
Greta Garbo

Marlene 
Dietrich.
 Without that we can™t live. And they
 laughed . And where did you want to 
Œ to live in
 America
. I know b Œ ab out the 
United Sta tes 
something, I have some 
education, okay. Hm, what do you want? I wa
nt a city where there is a university, or 
there are cultural organizations, because I 
am a humanitarian. I will find something. 
With English is with me bad. But I Œ I wa Œ I will Œ I will do it. 
Philadelph ia
 would 
be good? Yes. And I came to 
Philadelphia. 
Came to
 Philadelphia
 and we are 
living Œ I Œ I lost in my fa
mily 29 people. If I would co unt
 better, maybe there is 39. 
It is hard to Œ to Œ to
 Œ to tell, because in 
Warsaw
 was a tragedy. My father died, 
the Americans stopped to send the money, and a guy from 
New Jersey
 came and 
said, I give you so much dollars, but no 
more. To work. So. A
nd I never lived so 
excellent like in the 
United Sta tes.
 And I have such sentiments to
 America
, if I 
would be a young man for

America
 with 
arms in hand, because I unders
tand something in Œ in Œ in

anything else you would like to add th at 
we didn™t cover in this interview? 
A: Thank you. I am very glad th at I h
