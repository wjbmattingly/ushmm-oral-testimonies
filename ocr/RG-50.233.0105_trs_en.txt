April 14, 1992 
Huntington, Long Island, NewYork 
 
 
Today isApril 14, 1992.  I™mAnthony Di Iorio a
nd I am at the home of Mr. Fred Raymes in 

Huntington, Long Island, NewYork.  I™m here on be
half of the United St ates Holocaust Memorial 
Museum to interview Mr. Raymes about his experien
ces and his recollections 
of the Holocaust.  Good 
morning, Mr. Raymes. 

 

 

A: Hello.  How are you? 

 

Q: Fine.  How are you? 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: Feel like reme mbering? 

 

A: Not really, but I™ll gi ve it a try. 

 

Q: Okay. Whe n were you born? 

 

A: I was born in February 6, 1929 on a very cold day I™m told. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. And where? 
 
A: InGermany.  

 

Q: InGermany.  

 

A: In a little village called Hoffenheim 
near Heidelberg in the province of Baden. 
 

Q: Supposedly it™s a nice area. 

 

A: Well, it–.I  returned there recently and I was su
rprised how charmi ng it is. Yes, I must admit, it 
is very nice. 
 

Q: Do you have any me mories of growing up in this town? 

 

A: Oh, yes.  I re me mber a lot of things.  I lived 
ther e until I was ten or eleven years old so I have a 
lot of good -- eh -- 
a lot of me mories. 
 

Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters? 

 

A: Ye s.  I have one brother name d Men
achem.  He currently lives in Israel. 
 

Q: And he was the younger brother? 

 

A: He was younger by three years, yes. 
 

Q: And how about your parents?   Can you tell us some thing about your parents?  Who they were, 
what they did? 
 

A: Ye s. We ll, my mother was a typical housewife 
of its day.  My father was in business as a 
butcher. And they tried to ma ke a living to 
support us as long as they ma naged to do it. 
 

Q: Your father was a butcher in Humfenheim?  

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: Did you live in an apartment or your own house? 

 

A: We ll we lived in an apartment and then as a sort of -- because  the Jewish community was very 
small there, on the time we were deported there wa
s as few as ten families, my father acted as a 
cantor. Whe n the regular cantor left or died, 
I™m not sure, we ended up in an apartment which 

was adjoining to the synagogue.  So we lived th
ere until the Kristallnacht
 when, of course, the 
synagogue was destroyed and we had to move out 
of the apartment very quickly. We  moved in 
with an uncle who lived in that same  town. 
 

Q: So you lived in three differen
t apartments in a short period? 
 

A: Well, as I can reme mber, it was over a ten -year period.- 

 

Q: So your father ™s  butcher shop, that wa s se
parate, away from th
e apartment buildings? 
 

A: Yeah,correct. 

 

Q: Both of your parents were Jewish? 

 

A: Ye s, they were. 

 

Q: We re they Refor m, or 
Conservative, or Orthodox?  
 

A: Gee, I really don™t know.  But I think 
it™s a typi cal German traditional, I think. 
 

Q: MostlikelyConservative? 

 

A: I don™t believe we ate kosher in 
the latter years.  It ma y well be 
that in early years we were but 
I™m really not aware of it. 
 

Q: Do you remember what these apar
tments were like 
that you lived in? 
 

A: Not in any great detail.  I -- the only vague 
me mory I have is when I was perhaps three years 
old, and I believe it was about the 
time  my brother was born.  I reme mbe r  very vividly a mouse 
playing under his crib, 
that I kept watching. 
 

Q: A real mouse? 

 
A: A real mouse. And that™s about all I can reme mb er. 

 

Q: And he wasn™t  your pet mouse? 

 

A: No.  I don™t know where the mouse came from. 

 

Q: Did you have any pets? 

 

A: No, I didn™t, no. 

 

Q: Hobbies? 

 

A: No, not really.  By the time  I, you know, 1933 
wa s not very far away, I was four years old, and 
the little kids in the street very quickly stopped 
playing with us and would rather beat us up, so 
there was very little time  for hobbies.  
 It was more a question of protection. 
 

Q: Did any of the kids ever beat you up? 

 

A: Oh yeah, quite fr equent ly and I learne d to run as fa st as my little legs could carry me . 

 

Q: You me ntioned that there were 
very fe w Jews in this town and I imagine half of them were 
relatives. 
 

A: Not really.  I think we, my brother and I, a
nd another girl were the 
only children that I can 
r e me mb e r.  
 

Q: And you had at least one uncle. 

 

A: Ye s, but he didn™t live in that same  town. 

 

Q: No? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Okay.  Did you ever get to go to school? 

 

A: Ye s.  I started school when I was six, which I guess means 1935, and went to school for about 
two years, till --- or perhaps it was three, I™
m not sure.  No, it was two years. Till they 
prohibited Jewish kids from going to the public sc
hools. And I was then enrolled in a Jewish 
operated school in Heidelberg. And every morni
ng I had to get up about six and take a train all 
by myself to go to Heidelberg and in the eveni
ng I returned home .  I did this for one or two 
years, well until the Kristallnacht, and then I th
ink that sc hool closed. One or  two years, yeah. 
 

Q: How was it like going to school as
 one of the few Jewish kids? 
 

A: I don™t have very much me mory of t he school, 
except that there was a lo
t of persecution.  I was 
asked to leave the room when they talked about
 Nazi indoctrination, whic
h of course ma de us 
little Jewish boys stick out like a sore thumb. A
nd of course, whenever the kids could catch me  

they would either  push me into the --- some --- 
the embankment that fell up from the road, or 
beat me  up otherwise --- anythi ng they could do.  
Recently, I returned to Germany. This is an 
aside. And the semi nary student, who is 28 year
s old wrote a thesis on 
the life of the Jewish 
community in this town. And he found a lot of
 details about the history of the community, and 
myself and my fa mily, and so on. Things that 
I didn™t know, I had forgotten. And, in fact, he 
found my sc hool records. And I had forgotten 
all my grades, but I can tell you they were 
terrible. 
 

Q: You were a terrible student? 

 

A: We ll, it™s  not surprising. 

 

Q: Or, how did the teacher
s treat you? That was my
 next question, anyway. 
 

A: Howwhat? 

 

Q: How did the teachers treat you?   Some ti me s people had terrible grades but they were good 
students. 
 

A: Well, I really don™t remember.  I think all the te
achers were Nazis, ultimately.  Otherwise I don™t 
think they could teach. And I think as long as he
 had to put up with me  he did, and when I was 
prohibited from attending, I guess --- I really don™t
 know.  But I was surprised to find my grades 

after about 50 years, you know. Wa sn™t
 particularly paramount on my mi nd. 
 

Q: No.  Even then. 

 
A: I have the piece of paper, if you want to look at it. 
 

Q: That piece, his thesis
, oh, the book, the research.  
That would be interesting. 
 

A: It™s  quite amazing.  It™s  quite an experience to 
meet these Germans.  In fa ct, it™s  some thing I™d 
like to talk to you about later. 
 

Q: The rest of the town, were they, uh, was it mo
re of a Protestant town
 or a Catholic town? 
 

A: I don™t know what the percentages was, but
 I have the impression it was maybe 80/20 
Protestant, but I can™t  tell you. There was one church each, of course. 
 

Q: Did you have any, I hesitate to say 
friends, but any non-Jewish acquaintances? 
 

A: Yeah.  I don™t reme mber really playing with a
ny particular kids. When you ask that question, 
the image comes to mi nd of the first funeral I 
went to.  One of the non-Jewi sh kids died of 
some thing and the whole class, I 
was still in the public sc hool, we
nt to the funeral. The fi rst 
time I™ve ever been in the cemetery. And I vivi
dly reme mber the open grave and the casket in it 
and every kid was supposed to go by and drop a fl
ower on top of this casket. And I was so 
scared, I just couldn™t do it. That™s all I reme
mber.  Now whet her this kid was a particular 
friend of mi ne, I don™t know.  I don™t have any vivi
d me mory of ever really playing, or really 
having a good time to tell you the trut
h.  I, or perhaps I and my br
other, but my brother was so 
much younger, were always too busy fleeing from being attacked.  I remember the streets were 

full of pretty large rocks. Th
ese were not paved roads, they 
were dirt roads with rock over 
them. And I  always had bloody knees because I al
ways kept st umbling and falling as the kids 
would pursue me  or they would throw rocks.  
They were very handy little mi ssiles, you know, 
pick them off the floor and star
t throwing.  So my me mories were
 not particularly happy ones in 
that town.  
 
Q: These were kids that
 were roughly your age? 
 

A: Yeah, of course. 

 

Q: You didn™t have teenagers for exampl e going after you? 

 

A: No, they didn™t  bother with me .  Not that I re
me mber.  I think that some
 of the older people in 
town, in the time of higher excitement, particul
arly after, maybe Hitler ma de a speech, and we 
would venture out in the street
, in those days they still ha
d horses and wagons, you know.  I 
reme mber vividly one particular ma n who liv
ed close by comi ng down that street on a wagon 
and taking his, what do you call this
 thing that you hit horses with? 
 

Q: Thewhip. 

 

A: Yeah. Ta ke the whip and try to catch me  wa
lking in the street. You know, with the whip. 

 

Q: Crack the whip. 

 

A:  Cracki ng--- 

 
Q: Cracking the whip in your direction? 
 

A: No, not in my direction.  He hit me . 

 

Q: He got you? 

 

A: Yeah.  But I think in general 
that, kind of, was the exception. 
 

Q: It must have been lonely not having ma
ny kids your age that
 you could play with? 

 

A: I guess so.  I really don™t have
 any strong me mories of that. 
 

Q: How were you informed that you coul
d no longer go to this public school? 
 

A: I don™t reme mber.  I think just that one da
y, I think, my parents told me  I was going to 
Heidelberg to continue school. And they woul
d buy me  a ticket, a monthly commuter ticket, 
just like the Long Island Railroad. And every 
mo rning, I would end up on that train with a 
school bag on my back and a big thermos bottle 
in the school bag with the books, that was my 
lunch. 
 

Q: Did you know any Nazis? 

 

A: Well I think the village was full of them. A
nd based on what this fellow wrote in his thesis, 

more recently, apparently, he tried to interview so
me of them even as late as last  year. They 
threatened him with ma yhem if he ke pt up the research. 
 
Q: There are Nazis st ill in hold? 

 

A: Of course we observed ma ny of the, we saw ma ny of the Nazi festivals, and so on, going on.  
But, you know, the Nazis were, as usual, disciplined, and they would only take over the action 

when it was sanctioned like, Kristallnacht, and 
so on and so forth.  Otherwise, because, 
presumably, my father --- not presumably, but my father was a soldier inWorldWa r I.  He had 

some what higher stature, if you like, in hierarc
hy of how they were treat
ing the Jews and some  
others.  Of course in the final 
analysis it didn™t  do him any good. 
 

Q: And your father was in the German a r my inWorldWa r I? 

 

A: Yeah, he was in the German ar my for four years. 

 

Q: Adecoratedveteran? 

 

A: Yeah, he had a cross of this, 
a cross of that, which I reme mbe r
 he dramatically threw at the 
Gestapo agent when they eventually deported us. 
 

Q: In1940? 

 

A: In1940. 

 

Q: `This may come as a surprise
 to you but you were a privileged 
child because your father was a 
war veteran --- 
 

A: Is that  really ---? 

 

Q: --Apparently you were able to go to 
public school longer than the other kids. 
 

A: Wa s that so?  I had no idea.  I see. A little dist
inction. Yeah, they did ma ke a little distinction. 
 

Q: Ye s, two or three years. 

 

A: Ye s and I reme mber when the --- after the Kris
tallnacht, he was arrested and he was sent to 
Dachau like most of the ma les, if
 not all of them.  He was privile
ged.  He was let out four weeks 
afterwards and some  other people 
had to wait a li
ttle bit longer. 
 

Q: So he was able to return home after this fi rst trip? 

 

A: Yeah, well I think most of them returned home. 

 

Q: Yeah, what was his crime? 

 

A: His crime?   I guess being a Jew. 

 

Q: Being a Jew, that was it, right? 

 
A: Ofcourse. 

 

Q: He hadn™t done a thing. 

 

A: Well all the males were arrested, after the Kr
istallnacht so the reason,I don™t know what they 
are, logi cal, or if they needed any. 
 

Q: You reme mber Kristallnacht fairly well? 

 

A: Yeah, but before we talk a
bout it, I™d like to tell you one in
cident which was --- and I don™t 
reme mber what year  it wa s. We  lived in this little town called Humfenheim, essentially an 

agricultural town.  In those days some farmers st
ill lived upstairs and the cows lived downstairs.  
I mean that™s how close they were. And, the 
regional town called Si nsheim is about four 
kilome ters from there. And for some reason or
 another, my brother and I were walking to 
Sinsheim I don™t reme mber why, and one of the pl
easures along that road was that the road was 
lined on both sides with apple trees
.  It must have been the time  
when the apples were just about 
ripened, but they weren™t ripe yet. And to this 
day I love green apples. We  ate a lot of green 

apples as we walked along that 
national road, a two-lane road. A
nd we™d take a bite out of the 
apple and we  would throw the rest of the appl
e at whatever car was speeding by. We  would 
mi ss most of them but this particular car, we  hit right smack on the door and the whole apple 

splattered. The car came to a grinding halt, back
ed up, and it turns out that the apple had hit the 
SS sign of this particular car which was on th
e road.And the SS guy comes out of the car. ﬁWho 
threw the apple? ™ And we both denied it, and of
 course he knew we were lying.  He took our 
name  and didn™t say anything more. That night 
we  came home and our father says, ﬁI had a 

call– I was visited by the police. What did 
you guys do?  You were throwing apples.ﬂ  ﬁWe 
weren™t throwing apples.ﬂ  And he hi
t us across the face, I can still– 
 

Q: You lied to your father? 

 

A: I lied to my father. 

 

Q: He believed the SS over you? 

 

A: Well, I was so scared.  I reme mber that very
 vividly.  So when you 
say did I encounter any 
Nazis, well that was a very close encounter. 
 

Q: That™s a ve ry close encounter.  SS. 

 

A: I would guess it was 1938. 

 

Q: After you had stopped going to public school? 

 

A: Probably, yeah, probably. 

 

Q: And you didn™t know it was an SS car? 

 

A: No, no, we would throw apples at any car. 

 

Q: You hit the jackpot. 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Did your father have any non-Je
wish customers, I would think? 
 

A: I presume he did, as long as it wa s all right to buy from a Jewish shop. 

 

Q: Do you recall how his business fared after the Nazis came  to power? 

 

A: We ll, I think it quickly we nt to pot, but I don™
t really reme mb er the de
tails, really, I had very 
little to do with the stor e. 
 

Q: So you wouldn™t know whether there was boycotts? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Shunning and so on? 

 

A: No, I really don™t know.  I think it probably follo
wed the typical German history of this time.  
These villages were surprisingly proactive. A
nd based on what this fellow, recently has told 
me, it™s still true. 
 

Q: In general, the Nazis were much mor e
 popular and stronger in
 the small towns. 
 

A: Oh is that so, I see, I di dn™t  realize that. 
 
Q: The smaller the more likely– 

 

A: Oh. 

 

Q: Big cities tended to be Re d. 

 

A: Yeah, well because everybody knew everybody and of course the Jews stuck out like a sore 
thumb I suppose. 
 

Q: Even though there weren™t very ma ny Jews. 

 

A: No, but at least you knew who they were, and of
 course–An interesting incident that this guy 
told me. There™s a bakery there 
in this village, today, and would you believe that every Friday 
they bake and sell challah? And 
he told me that they do this
 because I guess the Christ ian 
population loved the challah, even
 though it was Jewish bread, right. And today, they have 
forgotten what the history, he told me, they for
gotten the history of why is this bread baked the 
way it is. 
 

Q: And when. And when. 

 

A: Yeah. This generation at leas
t, has forgotten.  It is amazing. 
 

Q: And yet they do it on Friday. 
 

A: Oh yes, yeah, for the weekend, in other words.
 That™s amazing I thought–here is archeology in 
action while I™m still al ive. 
 

Q: Do any other incidents leap to your mi nd?  

 

A: From that time ?  

 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: We ll, one memory is the–all of these villag
es had communal gardens– and if you didn™t, most 
people didn™t have a lot of land on 
their own, they lived in these 
villages, you could get a little 
plot from the community, raise your own vegetabl
es and of course, you take that home . And I 

reme mber my mother working inthiscommuna
l garden, you know. And we, as kids, would go 

to the local river which flows right by, which when
 I look at it now is about three feet wide, at 
that time it looked terrifying, and take water out a
nd put it in the garden.  I™m still afraid of 
water beca use we used to swim in this water, 
or try to, and the other 
kids would like to drown 
us. And I™m still terrifie
d of the water.  In fact, I™m a very 
poor swimme r,  I think as a result of 
that. 
 

Q: You live on Long Island? 

 

A? Yeah.  Incidents, and I am a sailor too.  I–On
e winter, we, I had some  s ort like a snow- suit on, 
very warmly dressed, it was very cold there.  
And in the kitchen we had a cooking stove which 
was fired, I think, by coal or wood, probably co
al. And a big pot of soup was bubbling away. 
Someone accidently turned that soup over and 
it landed on my leg.  I got a tremendous burn 

over here. This was the time  when Je ws coul
dn™t receive me dical atte
ntion from non-Jewish 
doctors and there was no Jewish doctor in th
is town. And I almost
 died because they– 
Eventually the doctor that delivered me  in 
1929 who ca me  from anothe
r little town, this 
Sisnheim I was talking about, snuck into the house at night and provided some  li mited 
            amount of me dical attention.. I reme mb
er that particular incident. 
 Of course I™m carrying that 
scar around 
      

 

Q: Wa s he a Jewish doctor? 

 

A: No, he was not.  He was a Chri
stian doctor.  I don™t reme mbe r  hi
s name  but he was a nice guy.  I 
reme mber a time, you probably know the year, when 
they insisted that all of the Jewish boys 
and girls get a Jewish identity card. When is that ™38? 
 

Q: ™38. 

 

A: ™38.Again we had to go to this 
(unintelligible ) town and get the ca
rd, get the picture.  In fact I 
have the picture here in my file, and from
 then on I had a mi ddle name  called Israel. 
 

Q: And if you has a sister? 

 

A: She would have been Sarah. 

 
Q: Do you remember your parents talking about 
politics or talking a
bout the Nazis in the 
household? 
 

A: I don™t have any real recollection. They must
 have been so preoccupied and so overwhelmed 
with the day-to-day problems of making a livingand ma king ends meet that if they did talk 

about it ma ybe they talked about it when I wasn™t present but I really don™t know. 
 

Q: Do you remember whether your mo ther was allo
wed to tend her garden until the deportation? 
 

A: I don™t reme mber how fa r that went, or
 how long this lasted.  I have no idea. 
 

Q: And Kristallnacht you reme mber? 

 

A: Yeah,vividly. 

 

Q: Vi vidly? 

 

A: Vi vidly. 

 

Q: Can you describe what you saw? 

 

A: Yeah, what I saw.  I went to the train that 
morning, and went to school in He idelberg. This 
didn™t happen in the night of the 
9th to 10th in this village. 
 

Q: They were behind a day? 
 
A: Yeah, I guess they didn™t get the me ssage or some thing.  Even though, you know, this was a 
particular  (unintelligible) what was hi s name? Wagner, I think, who apparently was more rabid 

than most. And apparently he was a ma jor fact
or behind this. And the first thing I knew is 
when I got to Heidelberg and got to school, in 
the school, they told a lot of kids to go back 
home  because some thing was happening.  Or ma ybe they told us what was happening.  I don™t 

reme mber the specific event.  I we
nt back to the railroad station. 
 

Q: This was at the Jewish school? 

 

A: Ye s. The Jewish school.  I went back to therailroad station and caught 
the first train I possibly 
could. This was not exactly on the half-hour.  
And as I was walking out from the railroad 
station and looking up the so calle
d main street, right by the little
 post office I suddenly saw my 
parents pushing a very large push
cart with whatever, in retrospect
, they could save from this 
apartment which was right adjoining the synagog
ue I was telling you about. And pushing it, 
you know, to my uncle™s house where they had ma de 
room for us to live with them. They did 
not, as I remember, they didn™t burn that synagog
ue. They literally took axes and hammers and 
kind of destroyed it bit by bit w
ithout setting it on fire. When
 I was in Germany about a year 
and a half ago, for the second time, the local mi ni
ster walked me  around the village. This is a 
whole separate subj ect. And he took me  to 
the place where the synagogue was, which I had a 

little trouble reme mbering and, well,
 there it was. They had mana
ged to put a little plaque up 
which said ﬁfor me r synagogueﬂ. They had, of cour
se appropriated eventu
ally the real estate, 
and a pharmacy had been built on that lot.  So ther
e™s no evidence. That™s really all I reme mber 

except my father being arrested, sent to Dach
au and came back, I believe about four weeks 
later.  It was snowing. This was November so
 this would ma ke sense. December, January or 
some thing like that.  He was limping very badl
y, had a red bandage, a red kerchief-like tied 
around foot, you know, ambling into the house.  I reme
mber that particular scene. That™s about 
all I can remember. 
 
Q: Kristallnacht, you never returned to the ap
artment?  Your parent
s had basically left? 
 

A: That™s  right.  It
 was all destroyed. 
 

Q: The apartment was gutted? 

 

A: Yeah, all the furniture wa s destroyed and wh
atever belongings we mi ght have had were 
destroyed except what they coul
d ma nage to get on that cart. 
 

Q: The pushcart was there at that time? 

 

A: Yeah,right. 

 

Q: And your younger brother was with your parents? 

 

A: I believe so, yeah. He was too 
young to go to school at that time . 
 

Q: Do you remember anything else on that day? 

 

A: Not really, not really. 
 
Q: Just walking into your uncle™s apartment. (? ) wasn™t  there either. 

 

A: We ll, no, he was also at Dachau, so here you 
had all the wome n and child
ren living in this one 
place.That™s the place where I got burned so it 
must have been ™38, ™39 it must have be en.  
That™s  right. 
 

Q: Do you remember anything your father 
said when he came back from Dachau? 

 

A: I really don™t.  I think it was – I think 
I reme mb er tears but I don™t reme mber words. 
 

Q: How was life the next few years? 

 

A: It™s a blank.  I don™t remember what life was lik
e the nest two years, except that my father ™s  
brother, wi th his wife and daughter, the (?) th
at was me ntioned earlier. We  lived in South 
Birken which is more or less on the border with 
Fr ance.  I guess they were forced to evacuate 

because Jews couldn™t live too close to the bord
er, I suppose, and they also moved in with us, 
with that uncle.  So now a fa mily of two s
uddenly became fi ve and now suddenly became eight.  

And of course, the house got 
a little tight with eight. 
 

Q: Were these uncles all br
others of your father? 
 

A: No. Yeah. The uncle we  moved in with was the uncle of my  father, not my uncle. 

 
Q: Oh.  It was your father ™s uncle? 

 

A: Yeah.  I think the two brot
hers were brothers of his. 
 

Q: Grand (? )And then the one from St arboken? 

 

A: Ye s, he was the true uncle to 
me .  He was my father ™s brother. 
 

Q: It was crowded? 

 

A: Yeah, it was crowded. 

 

Q: Did you continue going 
to school in Heidelberg? 
 

A: No, I don™t believe so.  I™m not sure, I™m not sure. 

 

Q: So you don™t know whether that school or whether– 

 

A: No I don™t know what happened to that school.  I reme mber the teachers names(? ) . 

 

Q: Reunion two years later?   Do you reme mber a
ny changes when the war broke out?   In ™39 or 
™40? 
 

A: Not really except that you know that the war was so favorable to the Germans so qui ckly they 
were all elated and I think the happier they were the more anti-Jewish they became.  I mean it 
just were a way of beating up on some body.  I r e
me mber vividly, I must have gone to school 
because I was in Heidelberg, and they had a bi
g exhibition under a tent in the mi ddle of the 
town square of some  of t he war booty that they
 had captured in Poland 
and France.  I think it 
was French equipment, ma ybe also British 
equipment from Dunkirk.. And of course, 
theoretically, only Germans were allowed there. 
At that time we couldn™t go to the movie– 
I™ve never seen a movie in Germany,  no we couldn™t go to the movies– 
 
Q: Notallowed– 

 

A: And, I always passed myself off as a Germ
an, you know, or a non-Jew. And, I would Heil 
Hitler up and down that tent, you know, and look at
 all that equipment, you know. All the ki ds, 
all the boys are interested 
in guns and stuff like that. 
 

Q: And they didn™t know you–? 

 

A: Of course they didn™t. 
 I had no trouble passing. 
 

Q: We re you proud as a German regarding these victories? 

 

A: I really don™t know.  I don™t think I thought of my se
lf as anything other than.  But I really didn™t 
have any of these philosophi
cal opinions at the time. 
 

Q: But you know, some time s kids, especially boys
, are impressed by military trophies, military 

weaponry– 
 
A: We ll, I reme mber Heil Hitlering, you know, just to
 get by, because it seemed like the thing to do 
(? ) I had blond hair in those 
days, I still have blue eyes. 
 

Q: You still have blue eyes. 

 

A: I didn™t have a problem. 

 

Q: You were anAryan. That 
brings us now to October 1940. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: How did you find out about this new voya
ge, this new trip of yours to France? 
 

A: We ll, as I can reme mber it, the police came to the door and they told us we had two hours to 
pack some  mi ni mu m a mount they allowed us to 
carry, I forgot how ma ny kilograms it ma y have 
been.And we went.  One of them sta yed with us. 
 

Q: One of the Germans?  

 

A: One of the Germans.  

 

Q: Police or storm troopers? 

 

A: I really don™t know.  I thought he had a black un
iform on but  I™m not sure.  I know he had a gun.  
Guns were still some what unique. And he kind 
of rested his hand on the gun, I think it was just 

a way of kind of resting his hand, I don™t thi
nk he meant anything. And frankly, I don™t know 
what the reaction of my parents was. Except 
that there was a lot of scurrying around and 
grabbing suitcases and so on and so
 forth and stuffing in rather ir
relevant things I™m s ure.  In 
fact, I know it was irrelevant because 
later on I found some of those things. 
 

Q: Did you help pack? 

 

A: Huh? 

 

Q: Did you help pack? 

 

A: I don™t think so, no, I don™t thi
nk so. And that™s  one incident 
I reme mber when my fat her had 
some  words with the policema
n. He mi ght have known hi m.  I don™t know whether he was a 
local guy or not. And, kind of threw him or hande
d him his Iron Cross fromWorldWa r I. The 
next thing I reme mber is we walked through the st
reets, I believe, down to City Hall, where the 
bus, some  s ort of bus or perhaps truck was wa
iting and they put us all in this truck, with 

whatever bags we had. The local Ge rmans were
, of course, were looking around their curtains, 
of course, and their doorways and what not. I don™t reme mbe r  anybody saying anything. And 

they trucked us to Heidelberg. To the railroad
 st ation. Where we boarded a waiting train. This 
was not a cattle car train, this was a passenger co
acher, and there we sat, probably waiting for a 
number of other people comi ng in, and eventually
 the train started to move.  I reme mb er an 
incident  where the accompanying Germans, I presumed they were Gestapo but I really don™t 

know, asked for all valuables. And I presume, as good Germa ns, we probably handed them 
over, I really don™t know. That™s  about all I can 
reme mber from the trip except eventually we 
stopped at the German border, and I™m al
most 100% sure it 
stopped in Mullhurst. 
 

Q: Mullhurst?   Did it? 

 

A: Yeah, yeah because I reme mber, I think I saw th
at name  on the station. And it stopped and went 
and it took a rather long time and eventually it en
ded up in some  siding. We  had no idea where 
we were because nobody told us where we weregoing. And they took us off the train and I™m 

quite sure it was raining and we ended up on du
mp trucks, I know these were dump trucks.  
There was a lot of mud, a nd they trucked us, I gue
ss, from (? ) railroad station (? ) into what 
turned out to be Gurst (?).  I had no idea where th
ey were taking us.  I me a n I had no idea what 
was going on. We just–it™s almost like being asl
eep walk at this point.  I don™t know what the 
adults were thinking. 
 

Q: Even though you were going to France? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Beforeyou– 

 

A: No.  I had no idea. 

 

Q: Nobody– 

 

A: I had no idea and I™m not sure they told this
 to anybody till eventually 
they ended up in France 
and of course they probably could see and read
 the signs at that time
. We  knew nothing about 
this Madagascar business and so
 on that eventually developed. 
 

Q: You all sat together on the train? 

 

A: Family? 

 

Q: Yeah? 

 

A :  Ye s . Ye s .  

 

Q: As far as you could tell of the Jews, all of 
Jews that you knew from your  town were on this 
train? 
 

A: We ll, I presume so. Yeah.  I knew all 
the Jews were deported at the same time– 
 

Q: Yeah.Yeah. 

 

A: –and I presume we were more or less in the same carriage.  I imagine they loaded those as 
people came along, I really don™t know. 
 

Q: What did you take?  Wh
at did your parents take? 
 

A: I really don™t know. But, I know that after 
my parents were re-deported from Gurst to 
Auschwitz eventually, my mother left  behind 
one of those suitcases which some how reached 
me where I was and it had a lot of bed linen in it. 
 
Q: Nobeds? 

 

A: No beds.  No.  But be
d- linens. At long last. 
 

Q: How were you treated at Gurst? 

 

A: We ll as you know Gurst was divided and me n an
d wome n wer e  separated.  Both of us ended 
with the mother. We  were in (?) if I reme mber right. You know being curious boys, this was all 

new. There was naturally a fence around it. Th
ere were barracks, completely bare.  I don™t 
believe we had ma ttresses.  I don™t reme mber that
 when we moved in there. And all the people 
were just kind of laying like stack
ed wood, one next to the other. 
 I saw my first death there one 
morning.  Some one who was laying near me , pe rhaps not next to me , passed away during the 

night and my mother rushed me out of the room, 
the barracks, as quickly as she could. This 
was October/November, and as you know was rath
er mi serable weather. Very muddy, very 
rainy, rather cold.  I don™t reme mber the barrack
s being heated, but they mi ght have been.  It 

was a rather, you know, difficult situation. The toilets were communal and washing area was 

communal where everyone washed in a long tro
ugh with, I believe it was a pipe that had a 
bunch of holes punched in it and some one turned the faucet on and the water came  out. 
 

Q: Coldwateronly? 

 

A: Yeah.  I believe so, yeah.  I don™t believe there 
we re showers.  I can™t  remember any showers.  
But then as a boy I wasn™t  too anxious to shower 
anyway.  I reme mber the toilets. They were 
surprisingly mechanical. You climbed up a bunch of
 stairs and there was a platform. And they 
had the fifty gallon barrels under the big hole an
d you did your thing and then it plopped into 
the barrel.And the–the small narrow range railroa
d, railway, rail line, circled the camp and 
they would move these barrels on 
top of some  sort of flatbed car
 like affair, and they would 
push it to wherever they would dump it. That™s
 how they moved it.  
I don™t reme mbe r  why I 
would know that detail. As kids, we would– th
e camp of course was not guarded by Germans.  
This wasVi chy France, guarded by French sold
iers who were relatively loose.  I don™t know 
how, but, we as kids, ma naged to crawl under the fe
nce and go to visit our father in the separate 
part of this camp.  My fa ther lucked out because he was a butcher, they thought he would ma ke 

a cook. And he ended up working in the kitche n. And he would sneak us an extra piece of 

bread or whatever he could lay his hands on.  
I have some  vague me mory of going– Some  of 
the older boys would sneak into 
the local town, which was about– 
 

Q: So you could get out of the outer fence too? 

 

A: Yeah. And I reme mber buying some pate, in 
a tin can.  I don™t know where we got the money, 
and going back to camp at night.  I reme mb
er one guard, oh yeah – we had a very good 
looking redhead in this barracks and– 
 

Q: That™s  right, you were in the wome n™s – 

 

A: Yeah, I instantly fell in love with her.  I 
don™t know how old she was, she must have eighteen, 

twenty. Wi t h long reddish hair.  I™ve had a red 
hair fetish ever since. And, I reme mber 
watching her ma king love with that Fr ench soldie
r, that French guard.  She wore a cross and 
obviously she was half, so-called, half Jewish. 
 
Q: She never reciprocated
 interest in you, though? 
 

A: No.  I was too young.  I saw my father ™s?  brothe
r there a few times.  I saw the other uncle, my 
mother ™s  brother.  I don™t  reme mber s
eeing my grandmother, who died there. 
 

Q: You didn™t attend her funeral? 

 

A: But she died after I left. The mud is the most 
me morable thing I think.  It
™s an incredible ma rk, 
it™s very deep. We , somehow, we, many of us 
ended up with galoshes, which is, you know, sort 
of a rubber shoe. If you stepped in 
that mud and then tried to pull 
it out, the suction of that mud 
was such that you could lose your shoe. And I re
me mber ma ny older people, falling in that mud 
and having a hell of a time getting back out of it.
 And if you went to help them, they would pull 
you in the mud. And so for ma ny months (?) st
ruggled with that mud.  I don™t know why that 
sticks in my head, but it seems to have been a ma jor problem– 
 

Q: That seems to be a major me mory 
of all the people w
ho were at Gurst. 
 

A: I reme mber getting some terribly strong vaccina
tions and believe it or  not I have a certificate 
from (? ) signed by the doctor at (?) against typhoi
d, diphtheria, etc. etc. Apparently these things 
developed in those great environments very quic
kly and they inoculated, 
I guess, all the kids.  
And I presume many of the deaths which occurre
d there, pr obably occu
rred due to some  of 
these epidemics that developed that 
you mi ght know more about us than I do. 
 

Q: When you weren™t eating pate, what were you eat
ing in this camp, what did they feed you? 

 

A: The standard fare seemed to be just some  sort
 of a soup with some  vegetables floating in it, 
that™s all I can reme mbe r. 
 

Q: Not especially tast y?  

 

A: Not particularly. The French eat
 a lot of beets, at least we ende
d up with a lot of beets, and (? ) 
we called them. 
 

Q: How about quantity? 

 

A: Oh I think we were always hungry. 

 

Q: You were always hungry? 

 

A: Yeah.  I don™t reme mber any particular packages
 comi ng in fr om the SalvationArmy or the Red 
Cross and so on.  I know these peop
le in later years, I found out 
they were quite active, but I 
wasn™t  particularly aware of that activity.  It 
doesn™t  mean that it didn™t exist. As I said we 
ma naged to get some  extra pieces of bread from
 my father.  He would 
hold it at the end of a 
long fork against this open fire where they
 had these big, tremendous
, fifty- gallon drums 
bubbling away with the coup of the day and he woul
d toast it. And they had these, ma ybe five 

gallon drums of fat standing there, and he would 
spread that on the toaste
d bread and that would 
taste like heaven. 
 
Q: Not a kosher kitchen? 

 

A: No, I don™t think there was any attempt at that. 

 

Q: Wa s there any cooking outside of this 
central kitchen where 
your father worked? 
 

A: Not that I™m aware of
, not that I™m aware of. 
 

Q: Now, earlier, you me ntioned that you
 saw your teacher from Heidelberg. 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Wa s there any attempt to resume  schooling, have classes? 

 

A: I don™t believe so, not while I was ther
e, no.  I have no recollection of that. 
 

Q: Now the time you were there. What did you 
do during the day when you weren™t sneaking out 
under the fence? 
 

A: I really don™t know.  I don™t know how we spent the time. 

 

Q: Not much to do? 

 
A: I guess, you know, kids at that age, as long as 
they are in reasonably 
good health, I guess we ran 
around, we probably became very rowdy and non-cont
rollable, I suppose.  
I really don™t know 
what we did. 
 
Q: I™m sure you tried to stay warm, this was winter. 
You had gotten there just in the nick of time as 
far as winter is concerned. 
 

A: I imagine I blocked out quite a bit of these ne
gative part, I only seem to reme mber the better 
parts, I guess. 
 

Q: Did anyone have any idea what was to b
ecome  of you?  Where you would go or how long you 
would stay or why you were there? 
 

A: I have no idea.  I don™t what the adults knew.
  I had no idea what they talked about.  I don™t 
know if they, me n and wome n, ever got togethereven for talking purposes. All I know is that 

one day my mother and father both said that 
they had volunteered us to be taken out of the 
camp by some organization and I don™t reme mbe r
 my reaction.  I don™t know whether I was 

delighted or reluctant.  But we found ourselves
, I guess, again on the truck with forty-seven 
some  other children, fifty children were taken 
out and we eventually ended up in a French 
orphanage, near that camp. 
 

Q: Do you remember when this was? 

 

A: Ye s. This was in 1941, February ™41. 
 

Q: February™41. 

 

A: So I was in that camp about three to four months. 

 

Q: You were taken to an orphanage nearby? 

 

A: Yes, so my brother and I, with
 the other kids, were taken to th
e orphanage and it turned out later 
on that a br anch of theAmerican Quakers, 
theAmerican Friends Service Committee, acting 
through the Swedish chapter, had ma de arrangement
s with the French government to take these 
fifty children out. The French inWorldWa
r 1, you know, had lost ma ny me n, so there were 

millions, I guess literally millions, of households 
without ma les.  So they built a whole number 
of orphanages – (side one of tape 
ended, pick up with side two) 
 

Q: We  were talking about the orphanage – 

 

A: Yeah. And this was now roughly twenty years 
later. The orphans of course had grown up, the 
orphanages were relatively empty and, I guess, 
some body was smart enough to realize that here 
was a possible place where, at least you could 
put some  people.As I understand it, the Quakers 
committed themselves to feed the whole orphana ge if they took these fifty Jewish children – 

So we ended up in this orphanage in a little pl
ace calledAspet,A-S-P-E-T, in the Haute Garron 
(? ) departme nt.  Near – 
 

Q: TowardstheAtlantic? 

 
A: No, no, no. This was right at the foot of the Pyren
ees.  It was not too far from (? ).  It was near a 
larger town called Saint Grodance (???). 
 
Q: But it™s toward the wester n part, that  woul
d be rather than towards the Mediterranean. 

 

A: I guess so.  But it is quite close by. We  ended 
up in this orphanage.  I believe it was a two or 
three st ory affair, there was a sort of a classi ca
l institutional looking affair. These German kids, 
of course now we were Germans, we weren™t Jewi
sh, in this French institution. The French had 

just lost the war so they didn™t have a lot of l
ove for the Germans, right.  So we were the (?) no 
ma tter how you looked at it. The director
 of the camp was an interesting ma n – 
 

Q: The director of the orphanage? 

 

A: Of the orphanage, and he had some  wome n who 
helped him. They organized us like little 
soldiers and that™s how – there 
were roughly half and half boys 
and half girls in this little 
group of Jewish children. 
 

Q: Keptseparate? 

 

A: We  were kept separate. As I reme mber we di
d not go to German schools, French schools rather. 

 

Q: The nationality of the director – 

 

A: He was French. 
 

Q: He was French. 

 

A: Ohyes. 

 

Q: And these Quakers – 

 

A: The Quakers just came  and went. I mean th
ey came perhaps once every few months and see 
how we were doing and then left.  I guess they 
pr ovided food in part for the whole institution.  
There were of course other Fren
ch children ther e.  It was a fairly self-contained community 
relatively speaking. They had their own fields wh
ere they raised vegetables.  I reme mber they 
had a ma n on the horse who did the plowing. They
 had an infirmary there. And I guess they 
tried to bring us up as sort of 
little bit like French kids would 
be. They walked us around the 
hall some what on a military side, but I guess that™s the only wa y you could control fifty kids. 
 

Q: They didn™t give you wine though? 

 

A: I don™t think so. 

 

Q: So you weren™t 100 % French. 

 

A: No.  I don™t think we had wine. 

 

Q: The nationality of these Quak
ers, was it Swedish orAmerican? 
 
A: Swedish. 
 

Q: Swedish. And aside from the schools was ther
e anything else that you had to do?  You didn™t 
work in the gardens or anything like that? 
 

A: I think we did some  chor es and at some ti me  
they brought in a Jewish couple who lived in the 
village and I think he would come  in and give 
us some  modicum of inst
ruction.  I doubt it was 
particular ly effective but they made an attemp
t when he was till busy hi ding of course. This 
wasVi chy France at the time. The only me mories
 I have is this farmer who took care of the 
fields where they grew the vegetables, one 
day they decided, some body decided, they were 
going to kill the cows so they could feed the ki
ds. And it™s an indescribable scene on how this 
cow was killed.  I don™t know if you want to hear about it.  For the hell of 
it I™ll tell you. There 
was a ma nhole cover right in front of the so-cal
led cafeteria, or the Refectoire, as the French 
called it, and they tied the cow down on this ma
nhole which was of course steel and relatively 
heavy, by the horns, so the cow was now sort of – 
 

Q: Nose to the ground. 

 

A: –Nose to the ground. And this guy, was a big gu
y, would take a pickaxe 
and would literally hit 
this cow between the horns.  It seems like hund
reds of times till even
tually, I don™t know how 
long it was, but it was too long, ev
entually the cow got on his knees and just died. The French 

eat blood sausages, are you fa miliar with that? 
 

Q: Ye s. 
 

A: Or blood, it™s  not even sausage. They take th
e live blood and bake it, I 
forgot what it™s called. 
 

Q: They put it in soup basically. 

 

A: Not soup, no.  It become s almost like a jello.  It
 become s, yeah. And th
at™s the first thing I 
reme mber them feeding us. And well, that™s one thing I can reme mber. 
 

Q: You scooped all of this up of course. 

 

A: Huh? 

 

Q: I mean did you really
 feel like eating this? 
 

A: No.  I have had an aversion to blood ever since. 
 But to the French this was fairly routine. If 
they killed a sheep, which was fairly routine, th
e blood would be collected
 and that was one of 
things – 
 

Q: And meat was a luxury. 

 

A: Oh yeah. We ll that was rare.  Every afternoon 
it seemed like they would insist we would walk 
in fairly ordered fashion through the villageand through the surrounding countryside, which in 

retros pect was quite beautiful. And they would 
teach us French songs and we would ma rch to 
these songs and that™s  how we got our fresh air. 
 I reme mber when we first got there, I guess we 
had a lot of lice and all the boys 
got their hair cut down to the s
calp, including myself.  I have a 
pict..they took a set of I.D. pictur
es of every kid.  I still have one
 of them from that time. There 
was a lot of bed wetting, I reme mber and I thi
nk I was one of them. And they shamed us – 
 

Q: Unintentiona l. 

 

A: Oh yeah. We ll I think all of the kids were obvi
ously disturbed. And that
 went on a long time.  I 
reme mber, I don™t know why, I reme mber the toil
ets, the typical Frenc
h, just a hole in the 
ground, with an appliance over the hole and youput your feet on either side and you crouch 

down and do your thing.  Paper was very rare an
d ma ny of boys would wi
pe their behind by just 
cleaning their finger on the wall. And one of the j
obs that we had was to clean the walls. We ll 
we tried to instill in the kids
 to stop doing that but one kid w
ould continue to do it and we 
couldn™t find out who it was.  So we decided to 
stake out the toilets. The toilets had fairly hi gh 
walls but they were open on top and on the botto
m.  So we put two kids on top of the wall 
watching, and this one kid would come  into the 
toilet and he did his thing and wipe his finger 
on the wall and of course we 
beat the hell out of him.  
 

Q: And made him clean it – 

 

A: And you know what his nickname  was for 
the rest of the time we were there? 
 

Q:  (? ) 

 

A: No. The name  for (?)  is (? ) in French.  Hi
s nickname  was (?). You know when you wipe your 

thing?   His name  was (?). 
 
Q: You didn™t ma ke hi m cl ean it? 

 

A: We ll what™s amusing is that in 1972, I believe it 
was, my wife and I went back and retraced all 
these steps I was just talking about. And we we
nt to this little v
illage ofAspet and the 
orphanage is still ther
e and it™s now a home, they told us, for disturbed children.  Of broken 
ma rriages, you know divorces are also rampant in Fr
ance. And I wanted to go see the toilets.  
And would you believe they are st
ill there and they™re 
still the way they were and the doors are 
still as high as they were, 
it™s amazing nothing has changed. 
 

Q: And the walls need cleaning. 

 

A: No, that I don™t reme mbe r. 

 

Q: Wa s your wife, you me ntioned you went back w
ith your wife, was your wife there as we ll? 

 

A: No, she was born inVi enna,Austria and she camehere in 1938, a day or two after Kristallnacht.  
And she lived in the St ates and I me t her here in the 50™s. Wh at else do I reme mber ofAspet?   

Not very mu ch except we  were there until 1942 and we had, the kids who had come  out of 

Gurst had not seen their parents for almost two 
years. We  were busy trying to, we were saving 
bread from our ration in shoeboxes because we we
re all excited that we were going to have a 
temporary visit with our parents, 
who at that time  had been transferred to (?).  I don™t know if 
all of them had but mi ne had. We  of course 
would get correspondence fro
m the parents, regular 
letters, my brother has most of these letters.  
And one day a car came, we were going to go there 
inAugust as a ma tter of fact. 
 

Q: So you were going to go to the (? ) 

 

A: –of ™42, right. A car came , a Gestapo car came.
 We  never saw a Germa n in that place. The 
Gestapo showed up. They went to see the director. The director called two kids in and said 

your parents are going to be transf
erred and they asked that you go with them.  Pack your things 

and go with these people. And they left.And I st
ill reme mber the name  of these kids.  He was 
one of my friends. And I had imagined that 
the worst had happened to him.  I told you 
downstairs that my brother is writ
ing a history of all of these kids
. Well he met this guy, he told 
me  last year.  He ended up after the wa r in Ea
st Germany and had a whole history of his own on 
what™s  happened in East Germany to him.  So 
he never ended up inAuschwitz. That™s what I 
had imagined.  I don™t know how he  eventually 
escaped. At any rate, to make a long story 
short, they prevented us from going to (? ) because, unbeknownst to us, that™s  when the 

deportation started. 
 

Q: That™s right. 

 

A: –re-deportationstarted. 

 

Q: That™s  right. The first 
deportation was toAuschwitz. 
 

A: And we stayed there for, up to the time, I beli
eve, when the Germans occupied all of France.  
Wa s that in ™43? 

 
Q: Nove mber of ™42. 

 

A: ™42.  So it wa s only a month or two later, right,August, September– 

 

Q: Yeah, a couple of months. 

 

A: And I guess at that time  they passed some  sort 
of law that Jews couldn™
t live within 20 miles of 
the Spanish border or some thing like that, and we 
were closer than that to the Spanish border 
and some  magic hand, I don™t know who, the Quaker, 
the Ouzay (?), or whatever it wa s, took us 
out of this camp and sent up temporarily toToul
ouse, where we were in some  sort of a school.  
And within a month or two I ended up in another 
town called Montsac (? ) which is in a town (? ) 
departme nt. And there was a children™s home th
ere which wa s run by a Jewish organization. 
 

Q: Ousay? 

 

A: It could have been Ousay (? ) and it was on the 
principle of the boy scouts)
 That is the life of 
this organization was, it sort of as 
you lived there a boy scout 24 hours a day. 
 

Q: Jewish boy scouts? 

 

A: Jewish boy scouts.  French Jewish boy scouts.
 Which is fairly prominent organization.  In 
Toulouse as I reme mber it, somehow my brother 
got separated from me. 
 I don™t know if it was 
on purpose or otherwise and he ended up in Switzer
land and spent the rest of the time, his time, 
in Switzerland. 
 
Q: But you didn™t  know that until after the war? 
 

A: I knew we were separated. 

 

Q: Yeah.  No, but you didn™t know that he had ma de  it to Switzerland? 

 

A: I don™t know whether I knew that or not.  I we
nt to see him a fter the war in Switzerland so 
some how I knew or found out where he was. 
 

Q: So the group of 48 transf
erred out of the orphanage – 
 

A: Yeah, but then we were – 

 

Q: And then you were broken up. 

 

A: –broken up. Yeah.  Different people ended up in
 different places.  So that takes us to 1943 or 
so.  Life in Montsac was quite different. This
 now was an openly Jewish life.  I wouldn™t say 
religious but observing. We  all joined boy scout 
troops, we ma de our bed, 
we did kitchen duty.  
They had some  sort of a schooling organized a
nd had organized a number of trade schools there 

where you could learn to become  a carpenter, a cabinetmaker, an iron worker, and so on and so 

forth.  Not terribly practical trad
es today but in those days that
 was the thing to do.  Not unlike 
the kind of preparation, I think, for people who mi ght
 want to emigrate to then Palestine. You 
know, they™d teach you a trade. That lasted for about a year. 

 
Q: These are all boys? 

 

A: No.  Boys and girls.  It was 
strictly co-ed. The girls were on
 one floor, the boys on the other.  
And we were getting through the pu
berty stage and in fact therewere some  that were eighteen, 
perhaps twenty. And you know, any number of girl
s got pregnant.  It was not unusual.  But it 

was fairly, you know, it was a decent life. 
 

Q: We re here boys and girls from other parts of France? 

 

A: Yes. They were French Jews and there were people fr om Belgium. These were families that 
mi ght have moved to – children who ended up from
 other countries in France before the war, 
didn™t have, necessarily French 
passports, you know, so all kinds of mi xture. There were not 
that many German Jewish children there. 
 

Q: They would probably come  from (? ) 

 

A: Ye s.  Btu they mostly, only, talked Fr
ench there.  By that time you either – 
 

Q: You knew French by then. 

 

A: We ll, yes, more or less.  I™m sure with a very heavy accent. 

 

Q: And ironically all of this wa
s under direct German occupation. 
 

A: Yeah.  By that time  it was. This hom
e started before the occupation of France. 
 

Q: You got there and it was early in ™43? 

 

A: Yeah. Ye s.  I™m quite sure that I ended up in early ™43. 

 

Q: Wi nter.  It seems like you™re ma king all your moves in winter. 

 

A: We  were there for perhaps a year, ma ybe more than a year when it was obvious that the 
Germans now had cleaned all the concentration cam
ps of the Jews they already had captive and 
they were starting to arrest other Jews including the French Jews. And whoever this ma gic 

hands was, decided we better move all thes
e kids so called underground, so to speak 
underground. And we all received French iden
tity cards, phony identity cards.  My name  
became Marcel Mant ue (?)And I ende d up hidden in a county seat called (? ) where Fr ench 

children would go to school duringthe school year from the far ms, they would stay in the 

school like here in the, you would have
 dorms  in a college and you would stay – 
 

Q: Boarding school – 

 

A: Yeah.  Like boarding school.  But public –Ad
 then during the vacation 
of course they would 
go home . And I bluffed myself throu
gh that school, hiding my identity. 
 

Q: So you had to hide your iden
tity from the other students? 
 

A: Yeah. 
 

Q: No one had to know.  

 

A: Yeah. That™s right.  I don™t reme mbe r  how su
ccessful I was. And during the summer, the same  
invisible hand had ma na ged to ma ke arrangementswith a number of farms in the area to take a 

number of children who had no other place to go. 
Whether these people knew we were Jewish 
or not, I have no idea and I spent either one or
 two summers  during the 
su mmer vacation that 
way on the farm. Guarding sheep. Ve ry useful, 
typical Fr ench far mhouse.  Probably ate very 
well. 
 

Q: Is this still the same  part of France, in the south? 

 

A: Ye s,it™ssouth. 

 

Q: Southwest? 

 

A: All southern France. While we were in Montsac, of course, in the boy scouts we would camp 
during the summer. We  would, in fact we camped 
some where near (?) in 
that French, in that  
partisan village we were talking about earlier.  
We  would celebrate the Jewish holidays. We  had 
a chorale , a singing chorale, which wa s 
presumably quite good, led by a young guy who 

became quite fa mous and lived in Geneva, Switzer
land, pe rhaps (? ) and a chorale director.  It 

was in retrospect, an interesting life. 
 

Q: Yeah.  I see smiles on your face.  It wasn™t  all bad. 

 
A: Yeah. There were some  tense mo me nts while we were underground, you know, as I guess we 
moved into 1944. 
 
Q: Is this when you were on a shepherd, 
or a farmer, or already before that? 
 

A: We ll, I don™t reme mber exactly. There was one summer when we ended up in some  other 
arrangement and the Germans, I guess, had found out that there mi ght be either some  Jews 

hiding or some  (? ) fighters hiding 
and they raided this place and 
we had to disappear into the 
woods rather hurriedly. We  heard machine 
guns of course and a number of people were 
arrested but some how I ma naged to get away. 
 

Q: Did you know anyone who was arrested? 

 

A: Oh yeah. Yeah. 

 

Q: Jews, Jewish refugees or rescuers? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber.  I guess there was more c
oncerned for fellows who were eighteen, twenty, 
twenty-five years old.  I was s
till fourteen, fifteen at the tim
e.  On the assumption you could 
hide your identity. You know, if you didn™t regi
ster for labor in Germany and so on you were 
subject to arrest even if you we
re French. We ll that™s how we some how got through the war.  
We  some how heard about D-Day. And eventually
 we all ended up back in Montsac in this 
home . The home  now took over a building, 
a relatively new building that theVi chy 

governme nt had built for physical education b
ecause they were going to develop their own 
ma ster race.  So we ended up in this rather pos
h building which today, incidentally is a hotel 
which I slept in when I was back
 there in 1972. It was a time-war
p experience of it™s own. And 
– 
 
Q: Do you know when you were liberated?   Or where you were? 

 

A: I don™t reme mber exactly where I was. 

 

Q: Summer of ™ 44? 

 

A: Yeah.  Must have been in the summer  of ™44. 

 

Q: Did you ever see combat troops, either German orAmerican? 

 

A: The only real me mory I have is seeing a big pi
peline with a lot of gaso
line leaking out of it and 
I™ve never seen red gasoline before
, it was all red, on some  of 
the ma jor roads we were hiking 
on.  I think, of course, that happened while we we
re in the boy-scout camp
 since they landed in 
June. This all happened during the summer so I 
presume we were not in school at that time. 
 

Q: The landing in Normandy was in June. The la
nding in the Mediterranean
 was inAugust. You 
were kind of in the mi ddle. 
 

A: Yeah.  So I™m sure I saw the pipeline that came
 out from probably Marseilles or (? ). There 
wasn™t  any significant fighting as I reme mber it in 
that area.  I think most of the fighting was up 
north of course and it didn™t take too long for 
the Germans to all hustle themselves north and 
east trying to– 
 

Q: Avoid the trap– 

 

A: –to defend the Normandy part of the inva
sion.  But I don™t think there was any fighting. 
 

Q: In your area they were in ri
sk, they were in danger of bei
ng cut off from the Mediterranean 
operation up the Rhone valley linking up with th
e operation north which would have cut off all 
the forces to the southwest. 
 

A: I see.  I see.  So what we saw more of
 was the (? ) taking revenge on the local French, 
particularly, I reme mber rather vividly the 
wome n who had so-called fraternized with the 
French, getting their hair shor
n, that was more prominent. 
 

Q: Those were the quite fortunate ones. 

 

A: So we ended back in Montsac and tried to return
 to norma l. The school st
arted again etc. etc.  
Some how I believe this was a Quak er (? ) some how got in touch with me . They wanted to know 

if I knew anyone in the United St ates and whether I 
wanted to go there.  So I said, ﬁWell, yes I 
reme mber my parents telling me  about an uncle in 
the United St ates.ﬂ  In re
trospect, it wasn™t  an 
uncle, it was a second cousin of my grandmot
her ™s.  It was a ma n who ha d come  over in 
some thing like 1908.  In fact, he was a brother of
 the ma n we moved in with after Kristallnacht. 
(?) and they placed an ad in the paper, in th
e NewYork area, and he had over his ma ny years, 

sponsored maybe some thing like 20 or 30 couples to 
come  here (? )And he told me  in retrospect 
he got a lot of calls. 
 

Q: So you didn™t have to be a cousin, or– 

 

A: On this ad. Well, at this time they were curi
ous  on who survived.  None of his fa milies. And 
he asked me  whether I come  over. And I said ye
s.  I reme mbe r  receiving a very large package 
with, I believe a salami  that looked like it was 
three feet long but ma ybe it was only one foot.  
And I reme mber standing at the children™s home, 
in my room which I shared with a number of 
other boys, and slicing salami  for two or th
ree hours because everybody™s comi ng by getting a 
piece of salami . After about a year, well, in f
act it was December ™46, I 
eventually came  over. 
 

Q: To the United St ates. 

 

A: And I came over early, be lieve  it or  not, because  I was not on a Jewish quota.  I was now on a 
German quota. And the German quota was unders
ubscribed because during the war, obviously 

did not come  to the United St ates. 
 

Q: It was unused? 

 

A: Yeah, and since I had so called – in the eyes 
of theAmericans I was a German, so I could get 
in under the German quota.  Irony, isn™t it.  So
 I ended up in Manhattan.  I came  over on the 
Nor mandy (?) 
 

Q:  (? ) 

 
A: No, I stayed here five years and I had a dying 
to go to California and I did.  I ended up in 
California for 15-16 years and came back 
here in 1970. And here we are in 1992. 
 
Q: Your brother who escaped to 
Switzerland, he went to Israel. 
 

A Ye s, I went to visit him after I had agreed tocome here to talk him into comi ng with me .  He 
had come  under the influence of very religious
 Zionist organizations, I don™t reme mbe r  who it 
was.  He was only about 11 or 12 and he was going 
to go to Pa lestine.  He insisted. And I said, 
okay, if that™s  what you want to do.  So he ende
d up in Palestine before the state became  Israel. 
 

Q: You were never tempted to go to Palestine? 

 

A: I mi ght have been but, I guess, not enough to do it. 

 

Q: We re your parents especially ha
ppy with (? ).  Did they ever ta
lk about or think about leaving 
t h er e? 
 

A: Ye s, they wanted to come  here. And as a ma
tter of fact they had a quota.  Believe it or not I 
reme mber the number. Not exactly, but it was some thing like 16,000 something, and they were 

waiting for an affidavit from this same uncle.  
And perhaps had the affidavit, I don™t know.  But 
obviously you couldn™t go until your number wa s up. 
 

Q: And the deportation of course.
