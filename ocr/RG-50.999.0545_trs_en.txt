Margit was  bor n Margit Mor awetz on Februar y
 
26, 1922, in Inns bruck, Aus tr ia
. 
When Mar git 
was  a baby, her family m oved from Aus tria to Pr ague, Czec hos lovakia
. 
The arr ow on this  m ap, the firs t

a
r row, this map of 1933 Europe
, 
points  to Austr ia and our s ec ond m ap points  to Czec hos
lovakia
. 
Pr ague is  identified on this  m ap of Czec hos lovakia.
 
 
Her e we s ee Margit at the age of 3
. 
She was  the younges t of four c hildr en born to Gottlieb and 
Lily Mor awetz
. 
Gottlieb was  a banker from a religious  J ewis h family.
 
 
Her e we s ee Margit's  fam ily a
t the 
L
ido, a beac h r es ort in Venic e, in 1926
. 
Fr om  the left are 
her  br other Felix, c ous in Er ni, her  brother Br uno, her mother  and father, Margit is c ir c led, Mar git's  
governes s, Yeya
, 
and her  brother Paul
. 
 
 
Margit's  father Gottlieb pas s ed away in 1932 when Mar git was  10
. 
In 1938, when Mar git was  
16, attack s  on J ews  in Centr al Eur ope es c alated and her m other dec ided s he s hould leave
 
s c hool in 
Pr ague.
 
Margit was  s ent to Paris to live with a French family where s he s tudied 
dr es smak
ing
. 
In 
Marc h
 
1939, Margit's
 
m other joined her in Fr anc e
. 
This  is  Margit with her dog Flippi, just befor e leaving 
Pr ague in 1938.
 
 
As  the Germ ans  were advanc ing on Paris, Mar git's  m other was  or dered to report to an 
as s embly point in the s outh
. 
Margit bought a bike and fled with other
 
r efugees  to the South of Fr anc e
. 
 
 
Margit found out that her mother was  at the Gurs  Detention Camp in Souther n Fr anc e, s hown 
her e in this  photograph
. 
She eventually got a tr ain ticket to a town outs ide of Gur s .
 
 
When Fr anc e s ur render ed to Germ any in J une
 
1940, Margit's mother was  able to leave Gur s 
in all the c onfusion and join Mar git
. 
The two fled via Spain and Portugal to the United States where they 
s ettled in 1941.
 
 
In this  photo, we s ee Mar git in 1941, s oon after  she arr ived in the United States.
 
 
Upo
n her  arr ival in the U.S. Margit found employm ent as a dres s finis her on Madis on Avenue 
in New York City. From  ther e s he attended Black  Mountain College in North Carolina and m arr ied three 

days  after Pearl Harbor. Mar git would later  work  for  the Offic e of War Inform ation, s pend tim e with 

MGM Studios  and bec aus e of her language abilities  work  for  the U.S. Army of Oc c upation in Germany 
re
-
educ ating Hitler Youth. 
 
 
We c an't do justic e today to des c r ibing the remark able journey her life would take from ther e 
bu
t it inc luded many stops  in the U.S. and abr oad. Margit would eventually s pend 20 year s with the 
Montgomery County, Mar yland, public  s c hool s ys tem  s pec ializ ing in dis ability is s ues . She r em ains  on 

the board of an organization whic h s he helped found 27 years  ago that helps  youth with dis abilities  
obtain em ploym ent after graduation from  high s c hool.
 
 
Margit lives  in Bethes da, Mar y land. She has two c hildren and two grandchildr en. Her daughter  
Anne lives  nearby in Silv er  Spr ing, Maryland. Margit's  s on Paul is a
 
hos pital planner  at Montefiore 
Hos pital in the Br onx. Sinc e Mar git's  par tner , Ervin, pas s ed away in 2008 at the age of 97, Mar git's 
fr iend, now husband, J ohn
, 
takes ver y good c ar e of her.
 
 
Margit leads  tour s in all thr ee of the mus eum's exhibits  and s peaks  in var ious  s ettings  about 
her  Holoc aus t exper ienc e. Rec ently, s he s pok e in Congres s to c all attention to Syr ian refugee cr is is . 
Margit als o works  in the mus eum's archives  tr anslating doc uments  from Czec h and Ger m an to Englis h.
 
 
In 2003 Mar git's  autobiogr
aphy, 
ﬁ
Margit's Story,
ﬂ  
was  publis hed
. 
Imm ediately after  today's  
pr ogram  Margit will be available to s ign c opies of her autobiogr aphy, which is als o available in the 

m us eum bookstor e.
 
 
With that I would like you to join me in welc om ing our Fir st Per s on, 
Margit Meis s ner .
 
>> 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Thank  you very muc h.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Margit, thank  you s o m uc h for joining us today and thank  you for being willing to be our
 
Firs t Pers on
. 
We have an am azing c r owd for our firs t day of live
s tr eaming ove
r the internet
. 
So you'r e 
our  Fir st Pers on for us to do that with.
 
We have so m uc h for you to tell us  about in a s hort tim e s o we'll 
s tart
ed
 
r ight away.
 
 
Although you were born in Aus tria and your fam ily  moved to Pr ague, Czechos lovakia, when 
you wer e very young, you lived there until 1938 when your m other sent you Paris  at age 16
. 
Let's begin 
our  conver s ation today with you telling us , Margit, about your fam ily, your  com m unity, and yours elf in 
thos e years befor e you went to Paris when your life would c hange
 
forever.

> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, I was  the younges t of the c hildren, as  you s aw in the pic ture
. 
We wer e a 
very well
-
to
-
do fam ily that was  ver y intent on keeping up the dec or in whic h we lived
. 
As  the younges t 
of four c hildren and the only girl, I was  always  cons ider ed a little doll
. 
And I did not like that.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  They jus t wanted to hug m e and really sor t of play with m e
. 
And I thought it was  
not a good idea to be a girl and to be s o young
. 
Of c ours e, now I don't have this  pr oblem anymor e.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Margit, tell us  about your brothers .
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  I had thr ee brothers, as you s aw als o in the photograph
. 
The interesting thing 
about them is  that eac h one eventually s ettled on a different c ontinent
. 
My  oldes t br other, Paul, found 
r efuge when Hitler entered 
Czec hos lovakia
 
and Aus tralia
. 
My sec ond brother, Felix, had c om e to the 
United States  before the beginning of the war
. 
And my thir d br other, Br uno, bec am e a Canadian
. 
And I 
bec am e an Am er ic an
. 
So 
that was  r eally due to the fact that nobody in the wor ld wanted to give as ylum  
to penniles s  r efugees  and we jus t had to find it wher ever  we c ould.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You los t your father ear ly
. 
Do 
you 
r em em ber  m uc h about him? 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, unfortunately I don't remember much about him at all
. 
Bec aus e in the kind of 
world that I lived, c hildr en were the work of the mother
. 
And I prim ar ily had a governes s who really  
br ought m e up
. 
So m y father was a very dis tant figure but I knew that he was  an im
por tant m an and 
that one had to r espec t him.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  After your father  died you told me that you were put on a guardian
. 
What did that m ean 
to you and your m other? 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, m y father , I think , didn't believe that his wife, m y m other, was  able to handle 
financ es
. 
Bec aus e in that wor ld women were not expec ted to know anything about money
. 
So when my 
father pas s ed away, in his  will he decided to leave his  as s ets  to a guardian.
 
So, although we wer e a 
well
-
to
-
do family, my mother  did 
not have very muc h m oney with whic h to run the r ather c om plic ated 
hous ehold.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In 1938, after Hitler  annexed Austr ia, your m other and you m ade a momentous 

dec
is ion to s end you from
 
Prague to live in Par is
. 
Tell us  what c onvinc ed you and your
 
m other to make 
that dec is ion, why you chos e Paris , and what your life was  like onc e you wer e there.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, it was  a mom entous dec is ion, c ertainly
. 
But in the envir onment in whic h we 
lived where we really had no idea what was  going on in the world, it didn't seem s o m om entous
. 
I was  
in 10th grade
. 
I was  a good s tudent that pas s ed tes ts
. 
I was  not inter ested in s c hool bec aus e I was  
interes ted in boys .
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  And when my m other s aid you s hould leave her e, I thought that was  a good idea
. I 
was  pr oud that mother  had c onfidenc e in me at age 16 that I c ould take care of m ys elf in a for eign 
c ountr y
. 
And I knew Fr enc h bec aus e we had had a Fr enc h gover nes s  at hom e, s o the language was  
not a pr oblem.
 
 
I was  going to go to Par is  to s tudy 
dr es sm ak
ing
. 
Now, why 
dr es sm ak
ing?  You have to 
unders tand that in 1932 if you wanted a dr es s, you didn't go to the department s tore
. 
You went to the 
dr es sm aker
. 
S o 
dr es smak
ing, s ewing, was a very res pec table profes s ion
. 
And I thought the 
idea
 
--
 
bec aus e we knew that the J ews  los t all of their as s ets  if they wanted to em igr ate from Germany
. 
So if we los t ever ything, then I would have to be able to make a living s omeplac e
 a
nd the s om eplace 
was  very unknown with a language 
that I might not know
. 
So if I had a profes s ion like a lawyer or a 
doc tor, I would need to k now the language but as a 
dr es smak
er, I could make m y way in any c ountr y.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you were in Czec hos lovakia, before going to Paris , you were at all times an 

Aus trian c itizen
. 
What s ignific anc e was  that?
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, the s ignific anc e of that at the tim e
 
--
 
when I was  little it didn't make any 
differ ence
. 
When Austria was annexed in 1938, that bec am e a ver y important point
. 
I think if I had
n't 
been an Austr ian c itizen, if I had been a Czec h c itizen, my mother wouldn't have felt as  frightened
. 
But 
bec aus e Aus tria was  now part of Germ any and bec ause the anti
-
Semitic laws  in Ger many were ver y 

4 
 
threatening, she thought I s hould get out of that en
vironm ent.
 
When we c ame to Fr anc e, it s tar ted to 
m ake a huge differenc e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And we'll hear  m or e about that in a few m inutes
. 
Did you or  your  m other  k now the 
family that you went to in Par is ?
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  No
. 
Mother found this fam ily  w
ho was  willing to take m e in
. 
It was  a very good 
c hoic e
. 
They were lovely  people
. 
The
r e wer e young people, m y age, who took me in r ight away
. 
And it 
r eally was  not a diffic ult trans ition.
 
 
I think  for  m ost refugees  who had to leave their hom e, it was  a very traumatic  decis ion but I 
was  not the father of a fam ily who had outstanding in the c omm unity
. 
I had no standing anywher e
. 
I had 
not left anything behind
. 
So for me to leave was  rather an exc ur s ion
. 
I had no idea that I would nev er 
s ee 
P r ague again, my fr
iends
. 
It was  totally unpredic table.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At that tim e was  your mother  able to travel to s ee you in Par is ?
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  At fir s t s he was n't but then she dec ided to c ome and s ee me
. 
And during that tim e 
all of Czechoslovakia was  annexed
. 
So bas ic ally s he had left Pr ague as  though s he had gone on 
vac ation
. 
And when s he was  in Fr anc e, s he was not able to go back
. 
All that r em ained of all of our 
pos s es s ions  was  a little s uitc as e with whic h she c am e
. 
And from  one day to the next we really bec
am e 
penniles s
. 
Whic h was  a huge is s ue bec ause until then mother had been able to s end m e a c ertain 
am ount of money ever y m onth to pay for my expens es
 a
nd now that was  all gone.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we turned to what life was  like for  you in Par is and then in France, you 

m entioned Hitler annexed Czec hos lovakia
. 
That m eant es s entially that he took  c ontr ol of 
Czec hoslovakia
. 
And this  was  before the war  began.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Corr ec t
. 
That was  in Marc h of 1939
. 
It was  a huge dis appointment for 
Czec hoslovakia bec aus e Aus tr ia was  interested in being part of Germ any but the Czec hs  were really 
enem ies  of the Germ ans and they felt that the world had abandoned them bec aus e the Frenc h and the 
Br itis h m ade a pac t with Hitler to hand over  parts  of Czec hos lovakia without c ons ulting the Czec h 
gover nm ent
. 
So this  was  fam ous  appeas ement at Munic h whic h nowadays s ometim es you hear 
m entioned when ther e are dis c us s ions  about our dealings  with Iran
. 
They s ay this  is  going to be 

another Munic h, whic h m eans  we ar e going to be s old out again.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So Mar git, as you were beginning to tell us, your  m other did c ome to Paris
. 
So once 
ther e, you lived together for a while
. 
What was  your life like together ?  What did you fac e? 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  We had very little m oney, s o we lived in a r ented room
. 
I went to 
dr ess m ak
ing 
s c hool, ver y happily
. 
It was  fun
. 
At the beginning I was  a ver y bad s tudent but then I c aught up with the 
r es t
. 
I think I bec am e quite a c ompetent patternmaker and 
dr ess mak
er.
 
 
Then one day
 
--
 
then, of c our s e, Wor ldWar II started in September of 1939
. 
Bec aus e Austria 
was  part of Germany, Franc e was  at war  with Ger m any, I bec ame an enem y alien
. 
That bec ame very 
unc omfortable bec aus e the Fr enc h in general didn't want to have refugees there and
 
c ertainly they 
didn't need any for mer  Aus tr ians who were now Germans. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did your mother and you have the sam e status ? 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, it tur ned out that we didn't
. 
When war  c am e c los e into Franc e, my m other  
was  not perm itted to
 
live in P ari
s  wher e we had this  r ented r oom
 
s o s he had to m ove to the 
c ountr ys ide, a few miles  out
. 
And there, one day as  the war was  appr oac hing, s he rec eived notic e to 
pr es ent hers elf at the polic e s tation with three days ' wor th of food, whatever s he c ould c arr y on her 

bac k , and two blankets and s he would be evac uated, whic h bas ically was  the buzz wor d for being 
deported.
 
I took her to this  bus  station
. 
When I asked the people why are you deporting her and wher e 
ar e you taking her, they s aid, "None of your bus ines s
. 
Go home."
 
So just in the very las t m inute befor e 
m other  boarded her bus  s he took  out of her pocket a s ignific ant amount of money, whic h I didn't know 

s he had, and s he gave it to m e with thes e wor ds
. 
"It's now up to you to get us  out of here."
 
 
Now, I never found out what that meant but it c er tainly m eant that I had to get bus y to find her, 
to get her  out wher ever  she was , and to get both of us out, away from  the approac hing Germ an Arm y.
 

5 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, of c our s e, the Germ an Army did approac h in June of 1940 when they attacked 
Fr ance
. 
You'r e s eparated from your mother
. 
And you were for c ed to flee Par is
. 
What did you do?  Tell 
us  about that.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  In
 
--
 
I didn't have any friends in Fr anc e
. 
Mos t of my fr iends  were fr om 
Czec hos l
ovakia
. 
They were not enemy aliens  and they were able to leave without any pr oblem
. 
I had to 
go to the polic e every other  day to s how m y fa
ce
. 
They always  s aid
, ﬁI
f you do anything illegal, we will 
imm ediately arr es t you
. ﬂ  
And, of c ours e, I was  very thr eat
ened.
 
 
The c rowds  wer e s treaming out of Par is , away fr om the Nazi ons laught
. 
So I went to the 
polic e s tation to get perm is s ion to leave
. 
And when I got to the polic e station, the polic e station was  
opened
. 
The polic em en had fled, s o there was  nobody there
. 
So I couldn't get per mis s ion
. 
But I had an 
alibi that I thought I'd at leas t tr y to get perm is s ion.
 
 
And in my des pair, when I s aw all of thes e cr owds  walking, walking, I dec ided to take the 
m oney that m other  had given me and bought m ys elf a bic yc le
. 
A nd 
I found the only bic yc le that was  
available in Par is , I think , on that day
. 
And it had men's r ac ing bike handles , thes e kinds of handles
.I 
was  not a good bic yc lis t but I jus t knew
 
how to ride a bic yc le.
 
 
So I bought that bic yc le
. 
I had with me a little c ase for  the back  of the bic yc le whic h c ontained 
a s et of under wear, a c hocolate cr ois s ant, and my 
dres s mak
ing notes becaus e now that would be 
impor tant
. 
And then I had a c as e of oil paints
. 
Bec aus e as a dres s des igner , I had to be a
n ar tist
. 
S o it 
was  impor tant that I had thes e oil paints.
 
Now, when I think  about this today, it jus t s eem s  abs ur d.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that was  the s um total of what you had with you when you dec ided to flee Paris  on 
this  bike.
 
>> Margit M
eis s ner :  Absolutely.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Let me go back a little bit right before that
. 
You wer e out on the s treets  of Par is
. 
You 
were telling me you s aw ever ybody around there, their  fac es c overed in blac k .
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  That was  a s ign that the Germ
an Arm y was  appr oac hing
. 
The day before when I 
went to the polic e station to get perm is s ion, I s aw the people in Par is  with blac k  fac es and I c ouldn't 
imagine what had happened
. 
And then when I c am e hom e, I had the s ame black fac e
. 
So it s eems that 
the Fr enc h Ar my had put a sm oke s c r een acr os s
 
--
 
to be able to evac uate the Frenc h tr oops  acr os s the 
r iver  befor e the Germans approac hed
. 
So that was  a s ign that the Germ ans  wer e r eally at the gates of 
Paris  and that I had to leave.
 
It was  very frightening b
ec aus
e ther e were str eam s  and streams  of people 
all going in one dir ection, whic h I as s um ed was  going s outh
. 
They didn't have m any belongings
. 
People 
dr ove c ars that they didn't know how to dr ive and they got stuck
. 
It was  a tremendous ly c haotic

ill Bens on:  And literally thous ands  and thousands  and thous ands of 
P
ar is ians  on the r oad and 
ther e you ar e on your bik e with your  little provis ions .
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  All by mys elf, always  wondering wher e am I going, what am  I doing
.
  
Am I doing 
the r ight thing?
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Did you have an idea wher e you wanted to go?
 
> > Margit Meiss n
er :  I had wanted to go to theW
es t
, N
orthwes t of Fr anc e bec aus e the only fr iends I 
had in Paris  that were als o Aus tr ian, they als o fled and we s aid we would m eet on t
he nor thwes t cor ner 
of Franc e, near England.
 
 
As  I was  going on my bic yc le, I was  just r iding
. 
I didn't know wher e I was  going
. 
I was n't tir ed
.I 
was  not hungry
. 
I just kept bic yc ling.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You s har ed with m e that at fir st on the bic yc le you wer e ups et about being on a 

bic yc le, I think  becaus e young women your age weren't on bic yc les . 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Of c our s e, I was  c ontinuously c onflic ted about not only whether it was  the right 

dec is ion but whether a young lady in m y s ituation c ould r eally do s omething that unus ual, whether it 
was  pr oper
. 
 
 
Ever ything in my life had to be, quote, proper becaus e that is the kind of world that I gr ew up 
in
. 
And if you r em em ber  the fir s t pic tur e that you s aw on the s cr een was  of me of a little gir l with whit
e 

6 
 
s ocks
. 
Well, thes e white s ocks  were really impor tant bec aus e I went to the park  with m y gover nes s with 
white s ocks and the big is s ue was  that I s houldn't s tep in anything and make my white s ocks dirty
. 
S
o a 
pr oper little gir l could walk in pr oper white s
ock s
. 
So that c onc ept c ontinued throughout my 
adoles c enc e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So her e you are on this  bike riding all day with thous ands  of people
. 
What happened at 
the end of the firs t day?
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  At the end of the first day a polic eman m otioned to me as it was  getting dark  and 
s aid, "Come c los e."  Of cour s e, I was  s ur e he was  going to ask  me for my papers
. 
I didn't have the 
pr oper paper s
 a
nd he was  going to arr est me
. 
But he s aid, "Madam , tak e your bic yc le
. 
You c an s pend 
the night in the s chool in the next block  and you can lie down on the c las s room floor and s pend the 
night."  So I took  m y bic y c le and went to the s c hool
. 
 
 
And when I laid down there, it occ urr ed to m e that I had a letter in m y pocket, a letter whic h I 
had r ec eived just 
before 
I l
eft the hous e and hadn't looked at bec aus e I didn't rec ognize the 
handwr iting. I looked at the letter  and it was  from  s om ebody who m y m other  had been able to tell that 
s he was  in a concentration c amp, in a Frenc h c amp c alled Gurs
. 
Now, nobody had ever  h
ear d of Gur s 
but I knew
 
--
 
it s aid that it was  c los e to the Pyrenees  at the Fr enc h
-
Spanish border
. 
So at leas t I had an 
idea where Gur s was  and wher e I c ould m aybe find my mother .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That was  day one
. 
What happened on day two?
 
> > Margit Meis s
ner :  Then on day two I c ontinued r iding
. 
Now I had a destination, although it was not a 
des tination that I had or iginally thought becaus e I was  going west and now I was  going s outh.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And now you're going to Gurs .
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  So I c ontinued riding
. 
I fell off m y bike
. 
I collided with another wom an
. 
We both 
looked at the bike, looked at the dam age of the bike
. 
It was n't s everely enough damaged that I c ouldn't 
c ontinue r iding s o I c ontinued riding.
 
 
A few m inutes later a young m an app
roac hes  me
. 
And, of c ours e, I got frightened
. 
What does 
a young man want from m e?  He s aid, "Madam , madam, you c an't c ontinue riding; you are going to 

los e too m uc h blood."  And he pointed to my leg
. 
And, indeed, I had a very deep gas h in my leg that 
was  b
leeding heavily but I didn't r ealize it
. 
I just kept on going
. 
I didn't look .
 
Now that he told me that I 
had a gas h in m y leg, now it s tarted hur ting
. 

>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  He als o s aid ther e is a drug s tor e not far from here, go there and s e
e whether you 

c an have the leg bandaged
. 
So I went to the drug s tor e
. 
The dr uggis t look ed at it and s aid you have to 
go to the hos pital, it has  to be s ewn up
. 
I s aid, "I can't go to the hos pital
. 
I have no paper s
. 
J ust 
bandage it."  Then he s aid to me, "Why ar e you riding a bic yc le?"  I s aid, "Bec aus e ther e ar e no tr ains  

in Fr anc e."  The r eality was  there wer e no tr ains in Par is but further s outh there were trains
. 
So he said 
go to the train station
. 
 
 
So with a bandaged leg I went
. 
And there was  another c haotic s ituation with hundr eds  and 
hundreds  of people were waiting for trains to arriv e
. 
It was  r eally c haos  with wom en fainting and 
c hildren c r ying, old women sitting there whimper ing
. 
It was  r eally a ver y c haotic  s ituation.
 
 
In the m iddle of this, after  I had waited s everal hour s  to approac h the window, ther e was  an air 
r aid alar m
. 
Ever yone went to the bas ement. 
I viewed the s ituation and dec ided I was n't going to the 
bas em ent
. 
I s tayed up on top and I watc hed the bombs  c oming out on both sides of the rai
lway s tation
. 
And fortunately they did not c atch us .
 
 
What I didn't know at the tim e was  that the s c hool where I had s pent the night a few hour s 
after  I left, bec ause I left at day br eak , the s c hool was  bom bed to sm ithereens
 
and I wasn't ther e 
anym or e
. 
So 
I was  ver y, very luc ky.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In fact, your dec is ion to not go to the bom b s helter at the train s tation m eant you wer e 
at the fr ont of the line when the air r aid was  over and you wer e able to get a ticket.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Corr ec t
. 
I was  
able to get m y ticket
. 
I was  able to r egis ter my bic yc le
. 
But I never  
r ode it again.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Where did you go from ther e? 
 

7 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, then ins tead 
of going to the W
est, the tr ain that I was in was  going s outh
. 
And when I got out, it turned out I was  in a town wher e I had fr iends, near the Pyr enees
. 
And when I 
told m y fr iends  wher e my mother was , they s aid it is  12 kilom eter s from Gurs
. 
So this  was  an inc redibly 
luc ky c oinc idence.
 
 
So the lady who took me in went to the c amp to see whether  s he c ould find m y mother  but 
s he c ouldn't find m y m other
. 
This  was  the day before Fr anc e c apitulated, s o there was  bas ic ally no 
m or e gover nm ent working
. 
She c am e back  and said, "I c ouldn't find your m om
. 
I left a m es s age
. 
She's  
m os t likely not going to get it s o I don't know what we're going to do."  
 
 
So I didn't expec t her
; t
hat Franc e had c apitulated and I was  not knowing what to do. One day 
I was  s itting in the yard
 a
nd fr om far  away a wom an c om es  up and waves  at me
. 
I didn't wave bac k
.I 
didn't
 
know anybody who c ould wave at m e
. 
And s he c ame c los er  and c los er
. 
She kept waving m ore 
energet
ic ally
. 
I still didn't res pond
. When s he c ame r eal c los e, it was  m y mom
. 
She was  s o thr illed 
to 
have found her c hild because s he didn't know where I c ould be
. 
S
he had no idea that I had bought a 
bic yc le and tried to leave
. 
She was  afraid I was  in Par is .
 
I was  s o s tunned to s ee her that I didn't even 
r un to em br ac e her
. 
And the one thing s he s aid about her c oncentr ation camp experienc e, bec ause s he 
never talked about it but the one thing s he s aid
: h
er e I found my c hild and s he was n't even c om ing to 
welc ome me.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we c ontinue, I want to ask  you a c ouple of ques tions
. 
When you finally got off 
the tr ain r ide, the train and into this  little town, what did you do when you got into that little town?  And 
one of the things I want you to s har e is  you ended up being taken to the polic e s tation.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  I went
 
--
 
I knew that I had fr iends
. 
I went to my friends ' hous e
. 
They were very  
welc om ing
 
but I c ouldn't s tay ther e
. 
Bec aus e there was n't r oom
. 
But they knew of a peas ant woman 
who lived on the other s ide of the squar e where I c ould maybe find a plac e
. 
So I went ther e
. 
It was  
3:00, 4:00
 
in the after noon
. 
I had not s lept yet
. 
I don't know whether  I had eaten anything
. 
I don't 
r em em ber that
. S
o the lady took  me in and s howed me the room  up under the roof and I laid down, 
finally s or t of thinking now I c ould r elax.
 
 
A few m inutes later
. 
I don't know how muc h later
. 
All of a s udden there's a knock at the door 
and two polic em en c ome in
. 
And the lady, the peas ant lady who had taken m e in, obvious ly thought 
ther e was  s omething s trange about me and s he alerted the polic e that I had c om e
. 
And thes e two 
polic em en took  m e by the arm and s aid, "We'll take you to the polic e s tation."  And, of c ours e, I was  

totally s tunned.
 
In this  town ther e is  this  big, huge c obbles tone square
. 
And two polic emen walking next 
to me and I thought the end of the wor ld had arr ived
. 
I started to c r y.
 
 
And then they took  m e to the
 
polic e s tation
. 
And the polic e c hief took  one look at m e and s aid 
to thes e eager polic emen, "Let her go."  So that was  a gr eat thing bec ause he realized that I was n't the 
s py they were afr aid of
. 
 
 
That was  befor e my mother  c ame
 
I had that exper ienc e
. 
And, of c ours e, it was  a ver y 
fr ightening exper ienc e bec aus e I was  nowhere, I didn't know what was  going to happen and it was  s uc h 
a chaotic tim e for ever ybody bec aus e the gover nm ent had just fallen, and no new gover nment was  in 

plac e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When your mother  did ar rive, s he had been in this c am p that people who didn't k now 

about, Gur s, but was  notor ious
. 
What kind of c ondition was  your m other in?
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  I r eally don't know very muc h about this exc ept that she s pent m os t of her time 

outdoor s
. 
She was  s o s unb
ur ned
. 
It's one of the reas ons  I didn't r ec ognize her
. 
She had lost s o muc h 
weight and s he was  s o sun
bur ned
. 
I think  that was  a reas on I didn't r ec ognize her .
 
 
She s aid it was  an unbelievable experienc e
. 
And s he r eally didn't talk about it
. 
But muc h later 
when s he was  at our house, when my c hildr en were little, when my c hildr en m ade a fus s about eating, 
s he always  s aid, "You s hould have been at Gur s
. 
You would eat whatever was  put in front of you."  
That was  the one thing she kept saying about Gurs , that they really didn't have enough food.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you told us , Margit, the Fr enc h gover nm ent had now c apitulated to the 
Germ ans
. 
You wer e in what's known as  the oc c upied zone.
 

8 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  The oc c upied zone
. 
So now
 
we had to get out of the oc c upied zone into the 
unoccupied zone if we wanted to leave
. 
Of c ourse we wanted to leave
. 
Ever ybody wanted to get out of 
the war zone.
 
 
We didn't have permis s ion to leave
. 
Mother, of c ours e, had no papers  and I did not have the 
r ight kind of papers
. 
We left our belongings
. 
I still have the little box on the bac k of my c ar  and mother  
had the backpack  with whic h s he was  arr ested and we gave that to a farmer with a wagon to take it to 
the other s ide, to the unoc c upied zone of Fr anc e
. 
And we walked out of the oc c upied zone as though 
we wer e just taking a walk
. 
And ther e was  no bor der there but people knew where the bor der was
. 
Ever y s tep was  fr ightening bec aus e we didn't know whether  they would find us  whether they c ould s ee 
us , what they would do with us
. 
It seemed like a ver y s im ple ac tivity that was  very s tr es sful.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Is that when you fell in with a group of Lutheran pastors ? 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Yeah
. 
That was  another  tr emendous  c oinc idenc e
. 
We found an abandoned hou
s e 
on the other  s ide of the div ide
. 
It was  an abandoned hous e that had a roof, it had windows  that were 
c r acked, and it had s ome beds tead
. 
So we dec ided that was  better than nothing s o we ins talled 
our s elves  there
. 
I c an't rem ember what we ate but we must have eaten some of the vegetables  that 
were ar ound.
 
 
A c ouple of days  later, a few gentlem en who wer e pr oper ly dres s ed
, 
who didn't s eem to be 
r efugees, c am e to this hous e
. 
And when we s tarted talking to them, it tur ned out that they were from 
Czec hoslovaki
a
. 
Im agine the c oinc idenc e
. 
And they were pas tor s  in the Luther an c hurch
. 
And they 
were als o fleeing from the Germ ans
. 
They were going to Mars eille, on the c oas t, on the Mediter ranean 
c oas t of Fr anc e from where they hoped they wer e going to be able to 
leav
e Eur ope.
 
They s aid to us, 
"You c an't s tay here
. 
You als o have to go to Mar s eille."  
 
 
It would have never oc c ur red to us  to go to Mar s eille if it hadn't been for thes e pas tor s
. 
S o 
again, tr em endously luc k y and c oinc ident.
 
So, indeed, we then tr ied to follow them but our  tr ip was  very 
e
ventful bec aus e we always  tr ied to avoid the polic e that were s earc hing the trail
. 
So when we s aw the 
polic e c oming, we tr ied to get off the trail, go back  on in the car in whic h they had been s o that they 

would not find us.
 
 
When we got to the polic e station
 
--
 
the r ailr oad s tation in Mar s eille, they wer e c hecking 
papers
. 
And, of c ourse, we didn't have paper s s o we waited until everybody was  gone, the polic e was  
gone, and they weren't looking anymor e
. 
So that's how we got into Mar s eille.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And once you wer e in Mars eille, fr om ther e you wanted to get out of Mars eille and get 

out of Fr anc e
. 
You and your  m other's determination to es c ape the Nazis  and to flee Europe would then 
take you on a jour ney over  the Pyrenees
 
m ountains  into Spain and eventually to Portugal
. 
How did you 
do that? 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  My m other was  c ompletely pas s ive
. 
This ver y, ver y c ourageous , energetic  lady 
didn't want to do anything
. 
She s aid to me, ﬁI
f we ar e going to leave here, it's going
 
to be up to you to 
do it bec aus e don't expec t m e to do anything.
ﬂ 
> > Bill Bens on: Was s he just wor n out at that stage?
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, s he was  s hocked by the exper ienc e
. 
She just didn't want to have any 
r es pons ibility and m ake any dec is ions .
 
 
So I bec ame very ac tive
. 
It was  r eally a r ole r evers al
. 
I bec am e the mother and s he was  the 
c hild
. 
I found us
, 
through c irc uitous ways
,  
a Spanis h and Por tugues e tr ansit vis a whic h meant we 
c ould
 
go through and wher ever  els e.
 
The Frenc h would not give peopl
e like us  exit perm its
. 
They didn't want 
us  there
. 
But for  s om e reas on they had pr om is ed the Germ ans they would hand over all the J ews  so 
they didn't want to give us  exit perm its.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you had trans it vis as  that would allow you to tr avel but
 
the Fr enc h wouldn't give you 
an exit vis a to allow you to us e the tr ans it visas .
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Exac tly
. 
So the exit vis as  wer e good
 
--
 
th
e trans it vis as  wer e good for a month
. 
And the month went by and we c ouldn't get the Frenc h exit permits
. 
So 
the las t day of the validity of the 
vis a we m et a gentlem an in the s tr eet who we barely knew and he said, "Yes ter day they let people like 
you c r os s  the bor der
. 
Go to the bor der ."
 

9 
 
 
Now, to take this  advic e fr om s omebody we har dly knew was  r eally not a ver y 
s m art thing to 
do but we did it
. 
We c ame to the border
. 
And everybody had to get off the tr ain bec aus e they had to go 
on to a different train
. 
And ever ybody left and we were left behind bec aus e the bor der polic e s aid you 
don't have an exit permit, go back .
 
 
So, again, it s eem ed the end of the wor ld had arr ived
. 
But ther e was  a porter  ther e to whom I 
c onfided our problem
. 
And he s aid, "Well, m aybe I c an help you
. 
Maybe I c an s how you how you c an 
walk acros s the bor der ."  Walk up on the Fr enc h
 
side and down on the Spanis h s ide
. 
And I s
aid
, 
ﬁO
k, 
how do we do that?
ﬂ
  
And he explained the way to m e ver y c arefully
. 
So I s aid to m other 
let's go
. 
 
 
And it was  r eally, if you think about it, it was  a lovely exc ur s ion because the weather  was  good 
and the c ountryside was  beautiful exc ept we wer e, of c ours e, tr emendous ly s c ared and s tres s ed
. 
But 
we walked and I knew exac tly wher e I was  s uppos ed to go
. 
But we los t our way.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Pyrenees has  peak s  as high as 11,000 peaks.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  It was  not that high but we los t our way and got c aught by the Spanis h polic e 
bec aus e although we had a valid vis a, we had c ros s ed the border at an unauthor ized bor der cros sing 
point.
 
So, they took  us  in
. 
This  was  a sm all border
 
--
 
r ailroad s tation
, to
ok  us  to the r ailr oad 
station
. 
And 
then dec ided they wer e going to take us  to the next town wher e ther e was  a polic e station, to arr aign 

us
. 
And I r em ember s itting at this  little r ailr oad s tation with two polic em en at either  s ide and my m other  
on the other  s ide and thinking that's the end.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  After all you had been thr ough, this  is  the end.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  So, we went to the polic e station
. 
It was  night by then
. 
There were lots of other  
r efugees at that polic e s tation
. 
It was , again, ver y c haotic  but not as c haotic  as  the railroad station in 
Fr ance
. 
They had taken all of our belongings, my box and my m other's backpack
. 
So we had nothing
. 
 
 
There was  a Fr enc h
-
s peaking polic eman whom  I appr oac hed and s aid, ﬁ Look , nothing is  
going to happen here until tomorrow m orning when the polic e station opens
;  
why c ouldn't we go 
s om eplac e and s pend the night?
ﬂ
  
And a few m inutes  later  he c am e back to me and said, "Follow me."  
So I thought he was  taking us  to s omeplac e where we wer e going to s pend the night
. 
Indeed, he did
. 
Bu
t that plac e tur ned out to be a pris on
. 
 
 
So now we wer e in a Spanis h prison that was  part of the F
r anc o fas c ist r egime
. 
That was  a 
very s c ar y plac e
. 
And the only other people who were in jail at the tim e wer e teac hers, bec aus e the 
Fr ancis t
s 
didn't think  the teac hers would ever  be dem oc r atic
. 
And the other group that was  in the pris on 
wore pr os titutes  bec aus e pr ostitution was  for bidden.
 

 
So ther e was  a huge hall where there were pr obably 60 beds
. 
The beds  wer e about this  s ize, 
half a yar d with a s tr aw m at on s om e kind of str aw on the iron s prings
. 
And that was  the bed for mother 
and m e
. 
And the light was  not turned off
. 
It was  very br ight
. 
And this  was  right next to the latr ine
. 
And 
the stenc h was  really awful.
 
 
In the m or ning we c ame to the polic e c hief who
 
looked at us and s aid, "So you ar e 
ex
-
Aus trians  whic h m eans  you're Germ an s o we will inform the Germ an author ities in Spain and they 
will c om e and take you over."
 
 
So all of this  whole tr ek that I jus t des cr ibed we did in order to avoid the Germ ans and then we 
were going to be tur ned over to the Germ ans in Spain
. 
But, you s ee, fortunately I am  here.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How did you manage that? 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, another  c omplic ated s tor y
. 
That's  why I wrote this book.
 
>> 
[Laughter and A
pplaus e]
 
>> Bi
ll Bens on:  In the little time we have left
 
--
 
we want to ask our audience to ask you s ome ques tions  
but you m anaged to get out of that
. 
And the book  tells  us how
. 
You made it to Portugal.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Made it to Por tugal
. 
And ther e I becam e a 
dres
s m ak
er
. 
So the idea that I would 
bec ome a 
dres s m ak
er without knowing
 
--
 
without having to k now the language was  c orr ect bec aus e 
her e I was  in Portugal, didn't know the language, but there were lots  of refugees now fr om  

Czec hos lovakia that had als o los t all
 
of their c lothing s o nobody had anything to wear  and they were 
delighted that they had a 
dr es smak
er to whom  they c ould s peak  in their  language
. 
So that was  ver y 

10
 
 
fortunate
. 
And I bec ame the 
dr es sm ak
er to the refugees
. 
I had to learn Portugues e ver y fast bec ause I 
had to go to the market and I had to go buy fabric  and it was  a ver y fast lear ning experienc e.
 
 
I had a ver y good tim e in Portugal
, m
ainly bec aus e I was not a young Por tugues e gir l
. 
Portugues e young women of a c ertain c las s  were never per mitted to walk in the s tr eets  by them s elves  
bec aus e it was n't pr oper
. 
They had to have an esc or t, a br other or a parent
. 
I was  not a Portugues e girl 
s o I c ould walk in the s treets  fr eely
. 
And the Portugues e young men all wer e im pres s ed that there was  
a young girl 
walking alone
. 
So they would s tart talking to m e
. 
And if I like the way they look, then I 
talked to them
. 
If I didn't like them , I s aid I don't s peak  Portugues e.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  In the very end
 
--
 
I made fr iends  with a c ouple of Por tugues e young men who then 
the day befor e we left for the United States took  m e to a res or t area to s how m e parts  of Por tugal
.Of 
c our se, we had no money, no time to be tour is ts
. 
We jus t had to sur vive ther e
. 
But it was  very ego 
s upporting to always  be ac c os te
d by young men whether I liked them  or  not. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Por tugal was  a neutral countr y s o it was  a s afe harbor for you
. 
But fr om there you 
m ade it to the United States
. 
Y ou c am e to the U.S. on a s hip.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Yeah
. 
Really quite r emarkably and unexpec tedly we wer e able to get an Amer ic an 
im migration vis a
. 
And then there were no boats to be had bec aus e ther e was  war and ther e were 
s ubm arines in the Atlantic  ocean
. 
So in the end, the only boat that we c ould find was  a Por tugues e c ork 
fr eight
er, c ork s  for bottle c ork
. 
That took about two weeks
. 
There were about five other people on the 
s hip
. 
I was  s eas ick c ontinuous ly bec aus e the boat was  very light
. 
And if I was n't s eas ick, I us ed to play 
ping
-
pong with the c r ew
. 
So I bec ame a ver y good ping
-
pong player
. 
And I als o learned a lot of 
Portugues e talking to the c r ew on the s hip.
 
 
When we c am e to the United States , one of m y brother s , who had been her e before, c am e to 
pic k  us  up
. 
Of c ours e, we did not arr ive and s ee the Statue of Liberty bec aus e we
 
ar r ived in a small port 
on the Ches apeake 
B
ay.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And here you are today.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Yes
. 
V ery lucky.
 
>> 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Thank  you.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We obvious ly c ould s pend hour s and hour s and hour s here with Margit and I wis h we 
c ould do that but we aren't going to do that today
. 
We have time for a few questions
. 
We'r e going to 
s tart first with taking ques tions  fr om  our  web audienc e on Twitter
. 
Then we will tur n it our live audienc e 
her e in the auditor ium to see if you have any questions .
 
 
Let's take that first ques tion that we have online
. 
I think  it's  back  ther e.
 
 
Car oline O'Neal ask s
:  
Margit, why do you think regim es c ontinue to target their  own people 
like thos e in Rwanda and Syria?  How is  this  still pos sible 70 year s after  the Holoc aus t? 
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, this is  a ver y im portant question
. 
I think as  a Holoc aus t s urvivor , I would 
have never  expec ted that s uc h a thing
 
c ould
 
happen again
. 
I very naively thought that if one had s een 
Hitler  and the 
per s ec ution of the J ews  on televis ion, the world would not have per m itted it
. 
So I was  
very naive and unfortunately I was  wr ong
. 
Regimes  s till persec ute their own people for r eligious  or  for 
politic al r eas ons and they ar e as  vic ious  as  the Ger mans wer e aga
ins t the Nazis
. 
 
 
I think  the Syr ian refugee c r is is  is an enorm ous  cr is is
. 
There are m illions  of people who ar e 
dis plac ed inside Syr ia and m illions  who ar e trying to s eek  r efuge abr oad and the wor ld is  not really 
interes ted in helping them or in helping them well enough and in unders tanding how to deal with this  
c r is is
. 
It's a m ajor  is s ue
. 
I have been s peaking about it at what Holoc aus t s ur vivor s  feel when they s ee 
thes e many, m any refugees  who have no plac e to go.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you, Margit.
 
 
I thi
nk  we have tim e for a c ouple of questions  fr om our  audienc e her e in the auditorium
. 
I s ee 
a hand here
. 
We'r e going to ask you to c ome to the m ic rophone if you don't m ind just bec aus e it's s o 
big and that way ever ybody c an hear it
. 
Try to make your question
 
br ief, if you c an
. 
And then I will 
r epeat it as best I c an just to make s ure everybody, inc luding Margit, hear s your ques tion.
 

11
 
 
 
Yes, sir? 
 
>> 
How do you feel that any of the r em aining Nazis  today
 
--
 
if they s hould be punis h
ed
 
or not?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How do you feel about any remaining Nazis today and whether or not they s hould be 
punis hed?
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, I think  m ost of the per petrators of the Holoc aus t ar e not alive anymor e
. 
Really mos t of them  are dead
. 
I r eally do not feel any animos ity towar ds  Ger many bec aus e the pr esent 
generation Germans r eally had no res pons ibility for  what happened
. 
The Germans wer e r es pons ible for 
having a gover nm ent like Hitler and for letting that government pers ec ute Jews  bec aus e they wer e not 

watc hing what the gover nm ent was  doing
. 
They were jus t letting it happen
. 
They were not anti
-
S em itic  
m aybe thems elves  but they wer e als o not willing to be active and do anything agains t the Nazis .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To stand up
. 
Thank you ver y m uc h.
 
 
Do we have another  ques tion? 
 
We have
, 
I think
,  
a young man her e and then a young woman 
in the middle.
 
 
Can you go to the m icr ophone?  You're going first
. 
You're like Mar git, walk ing on the r oad by 
her s elf.
 
>> 
What ar e your  thoughts  of Hitler ?
 
> > Bill Bens on: What are your  thoughts o
f Hitler
 
after all of this time?
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  I think  Hitler  was a der anged man who was  very clev er  and ver y c har is matic  and 

he was  able to per suade a large group of Germans  to follow his  way of thinking
. 
I am  a pers on who is  
not inter es ted in veng
eanc e
. 
I don't believe that that gets  you anywher e
. 
I think perpetrator s s hould be 
punis hed but one s hould not as c ribe r es pons ibility to bas ic ally innoc ent people who s tood by
. 
I wis h 
that he hadn't exis ted.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you, Margit.
 
 
I think  we 
have time for one m ore question
. 
You had your  hand up
. 
Now you'r e s tanding up
. 
There you go
. 
A ll right.
 
 
I'm going to als o s ay that Margit is going to stay
. 
She c onc ludes  the program in a few 
m om ents
. 
Margit
 
--
 
no, you have to s ign your book
. 
That's right
. 
So that might be an opportunity to als o 
as k  Mar git s ome questions .
 
 
Yes ?  A young m an her e. 
 
>> 
How d
id
 
you feel when your  mother went on the bus  and you didn't know wher e s he was  going? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Say that one more tim e for us . 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>>
 
Margit Meis s ner :  Right?  How do you feel
 
--
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How did you feel when your m other went on the bus , when s he went away?
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  That's a very good question
. 
Bec aus e I felt terr ified
. 
I didn't know wher e s he was  
goi
ng
. 
And you have to under s tand that one didn't know what was  going on in the world
. 
There was  no 
infor mation
. 
There was  no way for me to get any inform ation
. 
So I was  pretty terr ified
. 
On the other 
hand, s he had s aid to me it's up to you to get us  out of here s o I c ouldn't jus t be ter r ified
;  
I had to do 
s om ething
. 
I was n't s ure what I was  going to do but I went back  home and thought, now, what am I 
going to do
. 
So I think  that helped me over c om e the ter rorized part.
 
It was  a very tough moment
. 
 
 
I have to c ongr atulate you that you c aught that
. 
That was  very per c eptive of you.
 
>> 
Thank you.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being her e
. 
I r emind you that we'll do
 
First Pers on
 
pr ogr ams  eac h 
Wednes day and Thur s day until the m iddle of A
ugust
. 
For Apr il and May we will be lives tream ing them 
over  the inter net s o you c an watc h that way
. 
They are going to be ar c hived
. 
You c an look  at them  later
. 
So a lot of opportunities  to see our
 
Firs t Per s on
 
progr am.
 
 
It's  our  tr adition at
 
First Per s on
 
th
at our firs t pers on has  the last wor d
. 
So I'm  going to tur n to 
Margit now to c los e our progr am
. 
Then as s oon as  s he's  done, we want her  to m ake her way up the 
s tair s s o that she c an get up to wher e s he will be s igning c opies of her autobiogr aphy, "Mar git's
 
Story."  

12
 
 
And as  you c an s ee, there's  a lot of details  that we wer e not able to hear today that I think all of us 
would want to hear about.
 
> > Margit Meis s ner :  Well, the impor tant thing that I have to leave you with is  that you s hould not be a 

by
s tander when you s ee injus tic e in your own c omm unities
. 
When you s ee bullying, when you s ee 
s c apegoating, prejudic e agains t people who m ay be differ ent, don't jus t stand by and s ay I'm jus t a little 

per s on; I c an't do anything
. 
That's not r ight
. 
I think  what eac h individual does really does matter
. 
And 
the Mus eum's logo is  "What you do m atter s ."  I really believe that
. 
I try to live that way bec aus e 
--
 
I think 
that I c ontinue wor king here bec aus e I would like to tell people like you all how im por tant it is that you 

s hould be infor med about what goes on in the wor ld and in your  c ommunity and that you s hould be 
ac tive and s ee whether you c an m ake the wor ld a better wor ld, better place, where violenc e is  not us ed 
as  a m eans of s ettling problems
. 
So I'd like you to r em em
ber  that.
