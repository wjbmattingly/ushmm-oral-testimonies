>> Al Munzer: T he wor ks of  Sigmund Freudto the United States, was born in the same town that m y 
father was born in. His nam e was Abraham  Brill.  And anotherm ancam ef rom my m other's 
hometown, Isidor Rabi, and Isidor Rabi went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics in 1946. So here 
you have a very, ver y sm all town, but some people com ingf rom there.  
 
 
B u t afte r th e
 
FirstW orldW ar, conditions in those towns for Jews, really, becamef airly bad.  
T here was a lot of anti
-
Sem itism  andthere were lim ited opportunities.  So m y parents both lef t their 
homes when they wer e in late teens.  My f ather went directly
 
--
  
>> B i l l
 
Benson:  Separately?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Separately, right.  My f ather wentdirectly to the Netherlands, wherehe started a 

m en's clothing business, and m y mother when toBerlin to join some of her older siblings who had set 
up homes inBerlin. Berlin was the capital,"T he" place to goto inthe late 1920s, evenearl y 1930s.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Cosmopolitan?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Very m uch. It was am ajor changef orm y m other. Her m other, my grandmother,did 
not want to part with her.  Shefelt m y mother belonged in thebeautiful rural setting,f lowers, grass, 
not what she called the grime of  the city.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid your m other gotoBerlin?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  My m other cam eto Berlin probably about 1928.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just before Hitler began?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Just before Hitler really began his assent. She lef t Berlin in 1932to join m y father.  
T hey hadbeen childhood sweethearts. And they were m arried in Holland in 1932.

>> Bill Benson:  You even said to me thatall m y ancestors were tailo
rs. W as that true on both sides 
of  thefam ily?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  I think so.  It was really both sides of thefam ily.  There is a story told aboutm y 

m other's hometown, where af am ous Hasidicrabbi religious leader had theaphorism ,he said, " Never 
s p o il w
hat is new, always m end what isold." It was sort of  an indication thattailoring even got into the 
re ligio n .   
 

>> Bill Benson:  Al, you mentioned to me that your grandparents keptf ew of  their possessions, cash, 
furniture. W hy was that?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  T hey knew there was a history of  persecution in Poland.  Jews were not particularly 

welcom e there. And so they alwa ys m adethem selves ready to leave atam oment's notice. T hat's 
wh y they kept mostof  their possessions in cash or things that couldeasily be negotiated or carried 
with  th e m .  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith anti
-
sem itism  on the rise in Germ any with theassent of  Hitler to Germ any, what 
were the Netherlands like for Jews?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  T he Netherlands was a very welcom ing place. Jews had lived therefor many, m any 
centuries.  Actually, the sam e was true, until 1932, inGermany aswell, where there was 
--
 
Jews were 
fully integrated andeven assim ilated into theGerm an society.  Then in the case of Holland, into 

Du t ch  so ciet y.   
 
 
My o wn uncle,m y m other's brother, who lived in Berlin, was m arried toa wom an who was not 
Jewish, was Ar yan, if  you will, and that was very, very com m onplace in Germany.  
 

4 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T

Certainly, in Holland, you know, the Jews had religious f reedom form any, many hundredsof  
years, and weref ully integrated into Dutch society.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did other members of the extendedfam ily also go to the Netherlands?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, unfortunately, m ostpeople either rem ained athome
 
--
 
it's hard to part with the 
comforts of your own hom e, so som eof  them , m y m other's siblings,m y f ather's siblings, rem ained in 
those small towns in Poland.  Of course, eventually, all of them  were killed. Only oneof my m other's 
brothers ended up survi vi
n g.  T he brother who's actually in Berlin managedtoescape to Bolivia.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You still have relatives in Bolivia?  
 

>> Al Munzer:  As a result of that, I still have relatives in SouthAmerica.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Septem ber1,1939, Germ any in vades Poland andW orldW ar II begins. The 

following Ma y, 1940, the Germ ans invade Holland, France, what areknown as the Low Countries.  
T ell us how that affected yourf am ily and how quickl y was the effects f eltonce the Germ ans rolled in 
in May of 1940?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, all of the rules, all of those measures of persecuting Jews, isolating and 

persecuting Jews that hadbeen put in placeover several years inGerm any were reall y put inplace in 
the countries that they conquered in very, very short order. So,for example, oneof  thef irst things that 
happened in the Netherlands was banning ritual slaughter of anim als, which is required for kosher 
m e at.  
 
 
Now, that seem smaybe a hum ane typeof  thing, m aybeperceived that way, certainly a ver y 
benign m e
asure atf irst.  But then, you know, Jews had to register, and there was a census taken to 
determ ine exactly who was Jewish and who was not.

>> Bill Benson:  And where you lived?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  And where you lived, exactly.  T henpeople, just like in Germ any, had to take anew 
m iddle nam e, astheir identif icationpapers clearly showed who was Jewish and who was not.  
 
 
T hen Jews began to lose their citizenship rights, and they were no longer, for example, 
allowed to teach in theuniversities.  I've been
 
translating docum ents, as you indicated,f orthe 
m useum , andone of them  isa diary of a professor or teacherat thegym nasium in Holland.  He 

described what it was like tono longer beallowed to teach. He taught Latinand Greek.  He just lost 
his job. 
 
 
Jews had to register their businesses. Then,of  course, you hadto conf iscate
 
--
 
r e gi s t r a t i o n of 
property, andf inally confiscation of property.  So a very quick, over about a year, year anda half, 
tightening of the screws.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Inf act,
 
I read som ething that you wrote, you said that on March12,1941,all Jewish 
property is Aryanized.  What did thatm ean? 
 
>> Al Munzer:  It means Jews no longer owned property, that it now becam epart of  the state, it was 

owned by the state.  
 
>> B ill B e
nson:  As you say, that's a little less than a year after they actually occupied thecountry.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Yes.  One of the otherm easures was banning Jews, for exam ple,f rom being in public 
parks.  My m other describes the im plicationsof  that. You know, initially, people really did not obey 
those rules. Itm adeno sense at all. So shetooka baby carriage into apark,and a German wom an 
who worked f or the Nazi governm ent in Holland approached the baby carriage, and she lookedat the 
baby, andm y m other's heartalmost stopped. Andthe wom an suddenly said
 
--
 
she saw blue eyes, 

6 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  A VE R B AT IM  R E C OR D
 
 
blonde hair, " Ah, you can tell that's goodAryan stock."  Of  course, that was the last tim em y m other 
ever setf oot in that particular park. Af ter that, sheobeyedall of  the rules.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Eitherright bef orethe Germans cam e in or right af ter, I think your parents provided 

refuge toa Dutch official. W ill you tell us a little aboutthat?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Sure. T his was in May 1940. May 9, May 10, 1940,m y parents had been asked to 

hosta man who was part of the Dutch resistance against the Germ an Nazi invasion, and he had with 
him  a brief case containing plans to preem ptivel y destroy them ajorrailroad
 
center in Holland, in a city 
called Utrecht. The idea was that this wouldprevent the Germ ansfrom  using the railroads in Holland 

when they invaded. 
 
 
T hem orning of May 10, m y parentsand their visitor listened to the radioandthey heard that 
th e  city
, the port city of Rotterdam had been bom bedand really destroyed.  Shortly thereafter, the 
QueenW ilhem inaof  the Netherlands cam eon the radio and basically announced that Hollandhad 

surrendered. She called on people to do their duty wherever they happened tof ind them selves.  
 
 
T he reactionof m y parents' visitor was in Dutch "T hankGod it's over."   For him this meant, 
yes, we're goin g to be an occupied country, the endof a chapter, anew chapter in history i s about to 

begin.  Butfor m y parents, they
 
knew, they already had learnedenough about what happened in 
Germ any to their own relatives andhow they were being persecuted, and they knew andfelt 

suddenly ver y, ver y m uch alone, asalone with their two sm all children, my two sisters, wh o were born 
in
 
1936, 1938.  
 
 
T here are all sortsof  intersections between history in general andf am ily history.  M y parents 
were m arried virtually t he sam e date that Adolph Hitler became chancellor of  Germ any.

My oldest sister was born during the infam ous Berlin Olym pics, which were turned into am ajor 
item  of  Germ an propaganda.  
 
 
My second sister,Lea, was born Novem ber 8, 1938,Kristallnacht, the Night of  BrokenGlass, 
which I'm  surem any of you have seen the effects of in the Permanent Exhibition.  
 
 
So you have
 
af am ily trying to keep itself together as they read newspapers of all the terrible 
things that arehappening around them, and trying to continue leading a normalf am ily lif e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Shortly before you were born, your parents, Ibelieve, started to enroll your sister, 
Eva, in a Catholic school.  What prom ptedthat?  
 
>> A l Mu n ze r:  W ell,  t his  wa s
 
--
 
f irst, two reasons, really.  My sisters were enrolled ina Catholic 
school. One, they wer e bannedf rom attending public schools.  Jews were no longer allowed, 
Jewish kids were no longer allowed to attendpublic school.  
 
 
T he second was really, this was theirf irst,m y parents'f irst, attem pt at hiding m y sisters' 
Jewish identity.  They felt by enrolling them  in a Catholic school and having them par
t ic ip ate  in  a llof  
the things that students did inthe Catholic school,perhaps this was one way of protecting them and 

hiding their Jewish identity.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In light of that, and som e of the other things you wer e saying a m om entago about 
the intersections with history, your parents are well a ware what's taking place inGermany and 
elsewhere.  You wereborn November 23,1941. About19m onthsaf ter the Nazis occupied France.  
Your parents' joy in having a new son m ust have been tem pered insom e way by theirf ears, prof ound 
fears about what was going on aroundthem .  Any thoughts about that, in retrospect?

>> Al Munzer:  Yes.  Actually, it beganas soon asm y m otherfoundout she was pregnantwith m e.  
She went to see an obstetrician andthe obstetrician advised her, very strongl y, to have an abortion.  
He toldher that it would be com pletely im m oral tobring another Jewish life into the world.  
 
 
My m other, at thattim e, turned to the Biblefor advice.  And she readthis story of  Hannah.  
Hannah
, youm ay remem ber, was a wom anwho desperately wanted tohave a child and would go to 
the templeevery year and pray that shem ight conceive.  She madea silentpledge, if the Alm ighty 
wi ll gi ve m ea child, I will gi ve that child to theAlm ighty's service
 
all the days of  his life.  
 
 
It was in reading that story thatm y m other decided she couldnotpossibly have an abortion.  
So that was really
 
--
 
that was thef irstfear, if  you wi ll, thatm y parents had, andprior tom y birth.  
 
 
T hen,of  course, another
 
--
 
Novem ber 23, 1941, when I was born, just bef orePearl Harbor, 
another intersection,my parents had tom akeanotherm ajordecision.  Jewish boys, as is inthe Bible, 
are usually circum cised atthe eighthday of  life.  My parents'f riends very strongl y advised against it, 
because that would mark m e asbeing Jewish.  
 
 
In thatparticular case, it was a worried look of a pediatrician that sort of  changed theirm inds.  
My f atherturned to this pediatrician,he said,"W hyare you so concerned?"   He said, "W ell, it's nobig 
concern, but your sonwi ll need a m inor operation, calleda circum cision."  
 
 
My f athertoldhim about Jewish custom of  having a circum cision cerem ony, and that 
ceremony, probably one of the very last held in thef am ily setting, occurred eight days laterin 
Holland, inT he Hague.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Lastfor a number of years.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Quite a few years.

>> Bill Benson:  Over the next 10m onths, af ter your birth, by Septem ber 1942, conditionshad grown 
so f ar worse, so m uch m ore worse
 
in Holland, and that was a tim e when your parents began tothink 
about taking m ore dram atic stepsof  going into hiding. Tell us whatreally prom pted them  to take 

those kindsof  steps, because they're suchmajor life
-
changing steps to take. Whatprom pted
 
th e m ,  
andthen what can they do to m ake it happen?  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell, this was aboutthe timewhen the Nazis, German invaders were taking the next 
step, which was to callup Jewsf or labor duty, a deportation if  you wil l.  
 
 
Som any Jews began to think of  ways to avoid that.  Myf ather was called upfor laborduty, 
m anaged to def er thefirst tim eby undergoing a hernia operation, which hehad postponedfor a long 

tim e,and that gainedhim  a little bitof  tim e.  
 
 
But then m y parentsdecided that really
 
we needed to take stronger steps.  Andfam ilies in 
Holland hada choice. Jewish f am ilies could either go into hiding as a group, likethef am ily of  Anne 
Frank, they all went into hiding, into an attic in Am sterdam ,or othersdecided thatthefam ily would
 
be 
split up.  
 
 
Inm y case,m y parents decided that, asaform  of insurance so thatif one personm ight be 
taken, deported,at least 
--
 
killed, at leasttheothers who survived wouldhave a chance, so they 
decided thatthefam ily ought to splitup.  
 
 
So  
thef irstone to go into hiding was actually m y father.  He went into hiding in a psychiatric 
hospital af ter apretended suicide attem pt.  And that gained him  adm ission to apsychiatric hospital. 
T here were m any other Jews in hiding in thathospital.  
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  He actually attempted itas an actto get intothe hospital?  
 

10

>> A l Mu n ze r:  E xa ctly, th at's righ t, right.  
 
 
My t wo sisters were pl aced with a very devout Catholicf am ily.  T hewif e in thefam ily actually 
hada vision or dreamof  the Virgin Mary telling her to take in Jewish children,and she'sthe one that 
t o o k in m y t wo  sist e rs.  
 
 
Jewish boys were m uch harder to place, because they couldbe identif ied as being Jewish. My 
m otherf inally persuaded her neighbor, a wom an named Annie Madna, 
to ta ke me  in . B ut th en  afte r 

that, m y mother actually joined m yf ather in the sam epsychiatric hospital, but in her case working 
thereas anursing assistant.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith your two sisters being put into hiding with a Catholicf am ily, was your
 
m other 
ever able to share with you how she arranged that, how she made that possible? Youm entioned that 
the wom an hadhad sort of a vision she hadto do this. 
 
>> Al Munzer:  Right.  There were two Catholic priests, Jesuit Catholic priests who were ve r
y 
instrumental inf inding places where Jewish children couldbe hidden.  My mother's neighbor, one of 
theneighbors who was Catholic, very religious, ver y invol ved in a local church, she talked to these 
two priests, and they'r e the ones who really found this woman,thisfam ily willing to take inm y two 
sist e rs.   
 
>> Bill Benson:  In both your sisters' case, of course,as well as your own with the Madnafam ily, 

food was rationed,food was scarce.  Now you have extram ouths to feed.  Do you know how that 
wa s  
handled?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Initially, as I said, I was placed with m y m other's neighbor,Annie Madna. She got 

scared,passedm eonto her sister.  Her sister got scared,broughtm eback to Annie.  Finally, Annie, 

11 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T
 
NOT  A VE R B AT IM  R E C OR D
 
 
who was di vorcedf rom her Indonesian husban
d, passed m e on to her Indonesian husband, Tole 
Madna, and he also had custody of  their three children, so he hadanannie who took careof  the kids, 
a nanny by the nam eof  Mima Saina.  
 
 
My m other hadm ade sure that Annie had gotten ration cards and things like that, to carefor 
m e, but the Madnafam ily never asked, really, where they would getf ood, who would pay for this 
extra m outh tofeed.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hey just took iton?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  T hey just took it on.  Mima Saina was really an am azing woman.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we com eback to your stay at the Madnafamily, you mentioned that your 

m otherfound refuge by taking a job inthe sam epsychiatric hospital that your dad was in. W hat do 
you know about their tim e together in thathospital?
  
He  a sp a tien t,he r a s pa rt of the  staff.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  T his was m y m other'sf irst exposure, really, to mental illness. T his isa
 
--
 
mental 
illness was a m uchm ore severe problem , in the sensethere were really no drugs to treat patients.  
Nonetheless
, she really f elt that, with what was happening in the world, and contrasting that with what 
was happening in thehospital and the patients, she wondered how sanity really was going to be 

def ined. Crazy things were happening in theworld that really hadn
o explanation, no rationale behind 
th em .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Outside thef acility?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Exactly. T hey weren't in the psychiatric f acility all that long, but on Christmas Day 

1942,m y two sisters were brought to visit them ,at least, so they had a little bitof  a reunion right in 

12 
 
R OUGH DR AFT  T R AN S C R IP T

thepsychiatric hospital.  Major risk, but still, itwas their last chanceto see their two daughters.  So a 
s m a l l  pa r t  of  t he fam i l y go t  t o ge t he r .   
 
>> Bill Benson:  On Christm as Day, 1942?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hen the next day something dreadful happened?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  T he next day, the psychiatrichospital was em ptiedby the Germansof all patients who 

were there, and staff.  Thishappened in thatparticular city and inmany otherpsychiatric hospitals. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthesam e time? 
 
>> Al Munzer:  At the sam e time, in Holland. My parents were f irst takentoa prison inT he Hague, 
then on toa concentration cam pon Dutch soil,W esterbork, in northernm ost Holland.  Just like many 
others, in oneof  thediaries I've translatedfor them useum ,there's the story of a young wom an, abou
t 
19 years old, who work ed as anurseapprentice in oneof  thepsychiatric hospitals, and she was 

Jewish, and this was a Jewish hospital,and she starteda correspondence with a girlf riend.  I've been 
translating those letters.  Mostof  the letters are just girl talk, but then there are other things 
intervening, and the very last letter is just incredible.  She says, youknow, I have a choiceto make 
tomorrow.  I caneithergo into hiding like m any of m y colleagues and try to disappear,or I can stay 
wi t h  m
y patients, who really desperately need m e.  And this young wom anm akes the choice of  
actually staying with her patients,and of course, a week later she'skilled in Auschwitz.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your parents,as you said, went toW esterbork, thento anoth
er c am p.   
 
>> Al Munzer:  T hen they went toanother cam p, where they did slave labor, called Vught,the 

headquarters of the Philips Electronics Com pany in Holland.

>> Bill Benson:  Slave laborers there?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Slave laborers there.  Eventually f rom there, takento Auschwitz, thenm ultiple other 
cam ps af ter that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had toldm e that, som ething your m other whodid survive told you later, that 

when she was working at the Philips Electronics factory, in orderf orher tobeable to stay alive and 
work there, she convinced this them that shewas an expert in assem bling radiotubes, which she'd 
never done inher lif e. 
 
>> Al Munzer:  Never done in her lif e. Her neighbor, she learned very quickly ho w to dothis.
  
T h is  
little taskof  assembling radio tubes keptheralive in thatparticular slave laborf actory.  Later on,af ter 
she was taken to Auschwit z, then to anotherelectronicsfactory, Telef unken, which is now Siemens, 
there shedid theexact same thing, and it's what kepther alive.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou said she'd heardthrough the grapevine that being able to do that work 

was your ticket to maybe survivin g?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Absolutely.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  She took the risk, said" I cando that" ?  
 
>
> Al Munzer:  Sure.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your parentsdidn't get a lastchance to see you, you are with the Madnafam ily.  Tell 
us about your lif e with the Madnas.

>> B ill B e n s o n
:  She was the nanny?

>> Al Munzer:  She was the nanny, born in Indonesia, spokeno Dutch, was completely illiterate,but 
had really a heartof  gold, and she would walk m iles every day just to get somem ilkf orm eor 
persuade neighbors to provide some mi
lk .   
 
 
She kepta knife under her pillow, vo wing
 
--
 
a nd I slept in her bed wi th her, she vowed thatif  
any Germ an, if any Nazi would com e and try to get me, she would kill them . That'show strongly she 
felt about protecting me.  
 
 
T he house was searched several times by the Germ an occupationforces, and I had to hide in 
a cellar at times. W hat I do remember, someof m y earliest memories, is that's where Christm as 
decorations were kept.  So I rem em berplaying with the Christm asdecorations.  It wasn't all bad.  
 
 
Som y m em ories,being in the Madna household, are really, really very, very good ones, in a 
sense.  
 
>> Bill Benson: Whoelse was in the Madna household?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Mim a Saina, then threeolder children, Davey,W illy and Robbie.T hey were t
he three 
childrenf rom T ole Madna's m arriage. T he youngest was Robbie, who was younger than Iwas.  All 

theothers are considerably older.  By the way, I'm  still in touch withmy foster siblings, with the 
Madnafam ily.  Now wi th the advent of the security, as of  afew days ago we're now Skyping.

Bill Benson:  Here you are, this young Caucasian child, living in a household of anIndonesian 
fam ily, we saw the photograph there.  How is it possible tonot haveyou attractattention insom e 

wa y?  I know you were  hidden,but even neighborsm ust have had som e inkling potentially.

1945, you're still with the Madnafam ily, was an

In August, you were reunited with your m other.  Tell us about theevents during that time, your 
m other's liberation, what happened to yourf ather, and what it was like for you to be reunited, asbest 
you know, with your mother,particularly in light of the lossof your sisters.  
 
>> Al Munzer: W ell,my m other was actually l iberated through the intervention of the headof  the 

Swedish Red Cross,am an by thenam eof  Foulke
 
Bernadotte.  Henegotiated the releaseof  several 
thousand wom en, with Him m ler.  My m otherwas in thatparticular group. This was just before the 

endof  the war, April, 1945.  
 
 
My m other describes arriving at the border,actually, of  Denm ark, between Denm ark and 
Germ any, and com ing off the train andbeinggreeted by thisSwedish nobleman.  
 
 
She said, you know, he insisted on em bracing, hugging each one of theprisoners. T heyf elt

they didn'tfeel clean, didn't have the right clothes, they were ver y co ncerned about that. But this was 
how she was f reed.  Itwas obviousl y an incrediblem om entf orher.  
 
 
She was then taken toSwedenf rom  Denmark, toSweden to recover. T hen in August1945, 
she returned to Holland, where shef ound that her two daughters
 
had been killed, but where she 
found thatI had survi ved, and I was reunitedwith m y m other. 
 
 
It's one of the earliestm em ories, clearm em ories thatI have.  I was asleep, and oneof m y 
siblings cam eout to wakem eupbecausethere was som eone in the living room .  
 
 
I was a child, typical child of  about 4
 
1/2 years old, cranky, crying.  I was taken into the living 
room  where the wholefam ily was sitting in a circle, andthey passedm ef rom lap to lap. But there 

was one lapthat I wouldn't sit in, and that lapwas m y o wn m other,because I did not know her atall,

andasfar as I'm  concernedI already hadam other, Mima Saina. She was the one whohadtaken 
care of me, and who had becom em y m other.  
 
 
My m other realized that it would be very, ver y diff icul
t ,  i nf a c t,  t o s e par atem e f r om  M im a ,  so 
she arrangedf or Mim a to live with us, and soMim a would continue to carefor me while m y m other 

would go out,trying to f ind work.  
 
 
Unfortunately, Mim apassedaway about twom onths later. She suffered a cerebral
 
hemorrhage anddiedver y, very suddenly.  And I really have nom em ory of  Mima.  It's really am azing.  

All I remember is being taken to visit her grave many, many tim es. Som uch so that whenI returned 
to Hollandm any years later, I came to the cem etery, I was im m ediately able tof ind the place where 
Mim a was buried.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because you had been there?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  I had been there som any times before. Unf ortunately, m y father's story is a different 
one.  My f ather,m y parents were separated in Auschwit z, andm y father was sent on,f irst to 
Mauthausen, a very inf am ous camp, you will see a very part of the exhibit upstairs, where they had 
these hugeblocks of Jews, and the inm ateswere f orced to carry.  
 
 
From  there,he wasf orced to threemore camps in Austria,finally ending up ina camp called 
Abenzai, inthe Alps,and there in abandoned salt m ines,the Germ ans were assembling V2 rockets.  

My f atherdid slave labor there.  It was oneof the worst cam psoperatedby the Nazis.  My father 
su r
vi ved to see liberation by the 80th US Army, actually, but he was so ill, so weak that hepassed 
away.  He died two m onths later.  
 
 
About two years ago, actually through them useum, Im et a womanwho was a US Arm y nurse

who m ay well have taken care of m y f ather when she was there with the US Arm y. T hat was very 
im portanttom e, knowing thatthere had been a person who actually took care of him , having a 
chance to thank herf or the care that sheprovidedtohim and toother Jewish prisoners who were 
there.
  
It was very, ver y im portant tom e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather was liberated,and theref ore when he died he was in Alliedhands.  He 

was able tohave aburial place, which you told me about.  
 
>> Al Munzer:  Yes.  Yes.  People have asked me how I feel
 
aboutm y losses, how they have an 
im pact on me,and it's difficult to describe,becauseI was born into the Holocaust. T om e,having 
playm ates who were orphans, or living in thecity that was all reduced to rubble, was just part of  
normal life. So I didn'tknow any other world.  
 
 
T his sounds terrible, Iwas even jealous ofmy sisters as a young child, becauseeverybody 
would tell m e how wonderful m y two sisters were.  I had no understanding ofthe terrible things that 

had happened to them.  
 
 
So it's diff icult to talkabout.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  For your m other, she lost her husband, lost two of  her daughters, was separated 

f rom  you through the years, she went to Auschwit z, survi ved it, senton a death march, ended up at 
som e horrif ic cam psbefore she was liberated. W hat was it likef orher to survi ve and cope af ter 
those years?  
 
>> Al Munzer:  I really don't know how my m other was ableto copewith her terrible losses.  Theonly 

thing that I can come up with, that's what shetoldm e,that knowing m e, having m e survi ve was ver y, 
ver y im portant to her.

You know, one thing that Idon't think Im entionedearlier, was this circumcision cerem ony, 
there were som ephotographs taken,and two ver y sm all prints of those photographs, about1 x 1.5 
centimeter, or an inch in size, were with m y mother, kept throughoutthe concentration camps.  She 
kept them  hidden on her body, thosetwo small photographsof m y circum cision ceremony.  Shefelt, 
she haddeveloped this idea, this superstition, if you will, that if  she ever lost those photographs, it 
would m ean that I had died.  
 
 
S o  I rea lly, I th in k, wa s th e

Alm ighty all the days ofhis lif efor service, all thedays of  his lif e.  She rem indedm eof
 
that pledge, 
and it became an important part of m y life.

>> Al Munzer:  T here's actually som ewhat ofa m isconception about Holland.  Yes, we arever y 
fam iliar with all the good storiesabout Holland, and the Jews who we re saved and people who went 
into hiding.  But actually, next to Poland,the highest percentageof  Jews who lost
 
--
 
who were killed 
during the Nazi era wa s in Holland.  So Holland doesnot quite deserve the reputation that it has 

gotten, it has gotten over the years. It'sonly recently that Holland has come to term s with that. 
 
 
Holland actually had the second largest Nazi party in Europe,and there were a lotof  
co
llaborators in Holland.

I m entioned som eof  the neighbors,and one 
wom an, som ef ew years ago when I was back in Holland,
 
said tome, she said, "You drank m y 
m ilk ! "
 
I didn't know what she was talking about. T hen she described how every day schoolchildren in 

Holland would be given a little bottleof m ilk. Her m other told her to keep half the bottleforthe 
baby next

door.  
Sothis wom an,at a very, very young age, learned to be really a good 
neighbor andparticipate in a very im portantact of  rescue. 
 
Young children can learn a lesson very early.  Oneof  theamazing diaries I've translated was 
f rom a young wom anwho described what itwas like to attend school in Germ any in the1930s, 
during the Nazi era.  She said thata Nazi off icer would come into the classroom  every day, 
takeall of  the Jewish kids out, thena whole hour of  Nazi indoctrination would take place,then 
the Jewish kids would be asked to come back into the classroom .

those two rows of  those non

Jewish kids, and non

Jewish kids were told to spitontheir 
cla ssm a te s an d
 
yell out, " Youare poison tous!"
 
         
It's aterrible, terrible story, but whatmakes ita good story, and a true story, was that 
there was one little girl, 10 years old, by the nam e of  Hadwick Ashen who refused to 
participate. She said m y Jewish classm atesare as good as I am . W hat you aredoing is 
shamef ul.  And I'm not going to do it.

Shealso is a remarkable woman,translating the Bible into many of  the African languages.

Do we have another question?  Right here, young man right here.  Chris? 
 
>> Did you actually know what was going on when you were in hiding as a child?  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he question is, did you know what was going on while you were in hiding?  
 
>> A l  M

was happening tom ewas just part of norm al lif e.  Ididn't know anything any different,excepthaving 

to go ina cellar to hide periodically.  But I had no idea why that was,andI f rankly also saw absolutely 
no difference between m e and the other kids in the household who looked very, ver y diff erent,as you 
saw the photograph. To me, there were no differences.  I was really just part of thef am ily, and

>> Al Munzer:  I tried to visit m y f osterf ather, Papa Madna, periodically. W e always corres ponded.  I 
went to visit him , infact towards the end of his lif e, he lived well into his 90s.  People saidthathe 
stayed alive just so that
 
I could visit, he could visit with m e one last tim e.  
 
 
I came to visit him  in Holland, and we talkedfor quite a while, and I'll never forget his last 
words to m e.  His lastwords to m e is, "Takecare of  yourm other."   I'll never f orget that. T hen after
 
that, as we were leaving the house, he stoodat the window and took outa handkerchief and waved.  

T hat was the last tim e I saw him  alive.  He was well into his 90s. T othis day, I'm  still in touch with his 
fam ily.  He rem arriedaf ter the war, had threem ore children, and the only time all six children would 
com e together was wh en I was there. I was sort of the bridge, or the glue of  thefam ily thatkept the 
two sets of  kids together.  That happens, justas I said, up until now.

tom e isto see the number of people visiting this m useum , which is going to shortly be

My hope is that intelling m y story and the museum telling the story of m illions of others who 
went through the same thing that perhaps we canm ake adiff erencein the world.  Perhaps them ost 

im portant lesson is really that hatred can do som e terrible,terrible things and can leadto som ething 
like the Holocaust ora genocide. But at the sam e time, thereare people in this trem endous seaof  
evil of  the Holocaust who did atremendousam ountof  good, andpersonally I alwa ys f eel that the
