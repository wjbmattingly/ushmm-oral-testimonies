May 19, 1997
 
 

Question:   This is the United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum interview with 
Herbert Bitter, conducted by Gail Schwartz
 on May 19th, 1997, at the Holocaust 
Museum. This is Tape Numb er 1, 
Side A: What is your full name?
 
Answer:  Herbert Jerome Bitter.
 
Q:   And where were you bo
rn and when were you born?
 
A:   Born in New York
 City, August 4th, 1919.
 
Q:   Let's talk a little bit a
bout your family background.  
Where did your family come 
from?
 
A:   My parents came -- My biological pa
rents came from Romania, which I understand 
is now Austria.  And then 
my father remarried.  My ot
her mother came from Russia, 
Minsk in  Ru ssia.  Both came over about Œ all three of them came over about the same 
time, 1914, 1913, something like that.
 
Q:   Did you have any brothers or sisters?
 
A:   I beg your pardon?
 
Q:   Did you have any brothers 
or sisters?  Do you have any?
 
A:   I have one brother, who is  84 years old, in Florid a; I ha
ve a half sister who lives in 

New Yo rk; and then  I had a stepbrother who 
passed away about seven, eight years ago.
 
Q:   Let's talk right now a little bit about 
your childhood.  When 
you said "New  York 
City," whereabouts
 in New York? 
 
 
A:   Manhattan.
 
Q:   And wh at kind of
 schooling did you have?
 
A:   I went through high school, and th at's
 as far as I went.  
Abraham Lincoln High 
School in Brooklyn and Jame
s Monroe High School in th e Bronx.  Those were the two 
high schools I went to. My parents kept m
oving around because my  father was a grocer, 

kept selling one store, moving to anot
her borough, and so on and so forth.
 
Q:   How would you describe your 
family?  W as it a very close family?
 
A:   Not close, but a loving family.  My fa
ther -- my mother passed away when I was five 
years old and my  father rema rried two years late
r.  So there were two years that I was sort 
of kicked around from relative 
to relative.  And so me of them didn't want me because I 
wasn't a very nice child, actually.
 

Q:   What do you mean by that?
 
A:   Well, I was a little wild, a little cantanker
ous.  As a matter of fact, my mother always 
used to say, "Don't worry, you'll have childre
n." I had a son who was just as wild as I 
was.
 
Q:   How religious was your family?
 
A:   My mother -- my second
 mother was a Hebrew school 
teacher.  And the truth is, I 
got so mu ch  of religion that as soon as I gr
aduated -- rather, had my  bar mitzvah -- I quit 
the synagogue.  And that was it. That 
was the end of my  Jewish education.
 
Q:   Did you have any other feeli
ngs about being Jewish at that time?
 
A:   I didn't like being Jewish.  I really didn
't. Only  because I had so mu ch of it.  And I 
went to a Hebrew school wh ere the old peop
le used to look at young kids as Americana 
failed.  I don't know if you unde
rstand Yiddish.  Wild animals.
  Because we want through 
the halls of the Hebrew school.  And I just 
couldn't  wait to get out of there. So my  
Hebrew education was very, very nil until I got in
to th e service.  There, I found out that it 
was pleasant.  We discussed history with th
e chaplains and I began to find my  religion -- 
not that I was ever religious, but I began to 
find out a little bit about Judaism at that time.
 
Q:   When  you say you went to Hebrew scho
ol, was that an after-school Hebrew school 
and you went to regular elementary school?
 
A:   After-school Hebrew school.
 
Q:   What languages did you sp eak at home?
 
A:   My parents spoke Yiddish, and of cour
se I never knew I could talk Yiddish until I 
got into the service in Germany.  And that's
 where I began to speak half German, half 
Yiddish.  That consists of my  Yiddish today.
  And it was only because my  parents used to 
speak Yiddish in the house all 
the time that I sort of picked
 it up without realizing I could 
talk Yiddish.
 
Q:   Did you have friends
 that were not Jewish?
 
A:   Some.  Not too many.  I lived in Jewi sh neighborhoods mo st of the time, but I did 

have some.
 
Q:   Did you experience any anti-Semitism as a child?
 
A:   Not really, because living in a Jewish  neighborhood, I thought the whole world was 
Jewish.
 
Q:   All right.  Well, let's move on now.  
Did you have any other in
terests,  any hobbies, 
any sports?
 

A:   Well, in school I was on track, baseball,  the usual things.  Nothing outstanding.  I 
was never a real good athlete, so to speak, but I enjoyed athletics.
 
Q:   Were you close to your siblings?
 
A:   No.  My  brother, who's six years older 
than I, lived his own life.  He was always 
single.  He just got married maybe 15 years ago.
  He was always with the social bit.  And 
we were never a close family. 
 It was only after I got marri
ed that I began to have a 
family and a close family, my 
wife's family, my own family.
 
Q:   Now, you've graduated from high school?
 
A:   Yeah.
 
Q:   And wh at did you do?
 
A:   I went to work carrying the bags of
 a jewelry salesman.  And it was quite an 
experience, and I did that for about a year or 
two.  And then I went 
to work for a jewelry 
comp any.  And for the beginning of my  life be
fore the service, that
's about all I did, 
working for jewelry companies, 
because that 's where my experience lie.  And then I went 
into the service.
 
Q:   We're talking now prob
ably  around 1937, I guess, wh
en you graduated from high 
school.
 
A:   Yeah.
 
Q:   What was your knowledge of Hitler at 
that point, or what wa
s your knowledge of 
what was happening in Europe?
 
A:   Very little or nothing at all.
  I only realized -- that's v ery 
interesting.  I only realized 
what could be going on in Europe when  I was 
in the service. And I remember sitting in a 
Jeep and reading the Stars and Stripes newspa
per that they found out Œ I think it was in 
Poland, that they realiz
ed that Jews were being tortured. 
 And they  began to ex plain to us 
as to how the torture was going to  be.  And I 
read it.  A nd I'm Jewish. And I put the paper 
away and I went about my business.  It neve
r had any effect on me whatever, at all, until 
of course I went into the concentr
ation camp. And then I became Jewish.
 
Q:   So you were not aware of restrictions
 in Europe on the Je
ws in the mid '30s?
 
A:   Some.  I mean, I can 't say I w as comple
tely ignorant of what was going on.  I knew 
that the Jews were having trouble.  As a ma
tter of fact, we had re
latives in Europe, my 
father did.  I'm close to them today, as a ma
tter of fact. And my  father was trying to help  
them come over and so on and so fo rth.  Bu
t I don't know the details because I really 
didn't  care at that time.  I was too young. 
And I was worried about myself.  I was worried 

about my  well-being, so to speak, and findi
ng a job. Those days, it was important to find 
a job and support yourself and move ou
t of the house, which is what I did.
 
Q:   How old were you when  you moved out?
 
A:   Just before -- not long before I got ma
rried. I got married at 24.  I must have moved 
out at 21, something like that.
 
Q:   All right.  So now you had been wo rkin g.
  And you said you move
d out of the house.  
And then  wh at happened?
 
A:   Then  the draft came along.  I just want to get my  facts straight.  The draft came 
along, and I figured that's the greatest way out.  
That's  the best thing fo
r me.  I didn't  join 
because I was Jewish or because 
I looked to save the world.  
I joined to change my life. 
And this is the truth.  I was rejected six tim
es because I had a hernia.  And each time I'd 
go down  there in the hopes that they would let 
me get in. Finally they  wouldn't let me  get 
in, so I went for an operation, a hernia opera
tion.  It cost me $250, wh ich I saved up. And 
was it the sixth time I went down there?  I was 
rejected because of my eyesight.  I was 
put on limited service.  But the seventh time I 
got in. And as a matter of fact, I remember 
that first night in the service.  I had already 
met my wife.  I was going
 with her and so on.  
My first night in the service, they put me 
in a barracks with maybe
 100 other guys, and I 
was on th e top bunk. And there I was, lying on 
th e bunk.  And I'm looking at the ceiling, 
which was like a foot or two aw ay.  And I'
m saying, "What am I doing here?  Who need s 
this?  And I volunteered for this?"  And 
that was my  introduction into  the service.
 
Q:   What month and what year?
 
A:   1943.  I got out in '45.  Two and a half
 years I was in .  I'm trying to think of the 
month.
 
Q:   What time of year?
 
A:   I guess spring.  Yeah, it mu st have been
 spring.  Early spring
 o r  su mmer, so meth in g  
like that. If I had my discharge in front of me
, I could tell.  But I don't really remember 
the date.
 
Q:   And did you have any sp
ecific feelings about Hitler or what was happening at that 
point?
 
A:   No, not really.  I just 
heard ab out it but very vaguely 
from -- I read newspapers.  I'm 
an avid reader in that 
context.  And it didn't aff
ect me one way or another.
 
Q:   So where did you first go when you were drafted?
 
A:   I went to Camp Upton, New York or 
New Jersey, I forget wh
ere.  And we stayed 
there -- I was in the states for 
less than six months.  From th
ere, we went to Plattsburgh, 

New York, where I got 
married. And then we came down 
to Elkins, West Virginia. And 
then we went right to the po
rt of embarkation in a period of about six months.  And I 
went overseas to a place called Conington, E
ngland.  Spent a nice time there.  Never 
worrying about what the war was goi
ng to  be like or anything like this.
 
Q:   Let's b ack up a little bit.  
Why did you try to keep volunteering?
 
A:   I was a patriotic American.  T h at's 
the only reason.  Not because -- I had heard 
things, but it didn't affect me  
that much.  I felt that it was my job. I had heard about 
Hitler; I can't say that I didn 't. But it didn't af
fect me that much only because I didn't  pay 
too mu ch  attention to  any of that. And I was in
 there because I wanted to change my life, 
for one thing.  And for another thing, I wa
nted to get into the service.  I wanted 
something different. I wanted so
me adventure, so to speak.
 
Q:   Was your being Jewish a factor in volunteering?
 
A:   Very little.  And it all goes back to
 my mother who kept drumming my being 
Yiddish, my being Jewish, ov
er and over and over again un
til I just couldn't take any 
mo re. So I tried to be as -- not that I tried to
 be a goy, but I tried to be as non-Jewish as I 
could possibly be.  And I got along with mo
st everybody.  I never suffered any real 
discrimination, although so me of
 the boys who were in my  out
fit were religious and they 
took Fridays off and that sort of thing.  
And they were discriminated against, not me.
 
Q:   Had you talked in detail with your pare
nts about what was happen
ing -- this is before 
you were drafted -- a
bout what was happening?
 
A:   Never.  This is solely my own doing.  
The only one I talked to 
really about it was my 
girlfriend, who is my  wife now.  And my  pa
rents just wouldn't -- didn't understand.  They  
were Euro pean people. My mo ther, who is my
 second mother, was just as good to  me as 
my original mother, who I bare
ly reme mb ered.  And we had no 
rapport with each other.  I 
couldn't talk to them.  My father was busy in
 the grocery store.  My second mo ther was 
there helping him. And I never saw my  father, 
really.  H e 'd  go into the store before I got 
up, come back from the store after I was in be
d. As a matter of fact, I remember one time 
I walked into the house and I l
ooked into their bedroom as I pa
ssed.  It was a railroad flat.  

And I looked into th e bedroom and th ere was 
my father in bed.  I had never seen my 

father in bed.  And I looked in
.  I says, "Hi, Pop.  How are 
you?" He says, "Not so good." 
I says, "What's the ma tter?"  And I sat down. 
And it was like almost the first time I ever 
sat down with him.  I says, "What's the matt
er?" He says, "I hurt 
my back and I can 't 
move." And then I said to him,  "Pop, this is the first time I have ever seen you in bed 

sick."  I says, "I'v e never seen you that way be
fore." He says, "Herbert," he says, "I can 't 
afford to be sick." Wh
at I'm trying to bring out is, that 
was my  upbringing, the wo rk ethic 
and so on and so  forth.  But close to my  parents, I never was.
 

Q:   Let's jump ahead a little
 bit.  You were drafted 
and you're now
 in England.
 
A:   England, a place Conington.  We spen
t about three months there.  Very, very 
pleasant experience. And then
 we moved down  to Southa
mp ton, which was a staging 
area for the invasion of Europe.
 
Q:   What unit were you in?
 
A:   628th Light Equipment Engineers.
 
Q:   Of?
 
A:   Well, we were switched from army to 
army  because we were a small outfit, about 
100 men.  And we worked the shovels and the 
road grad ers and the bulldozers, and so on, 
clearing roads and so on.  We were doing th
at in England as well. And we were moved 
from the -- we originally went
 over, I think it was the First 
Army.  And th en we were 
transferred as we went down to the Third Ar
my .  And then  in Europe, I think we wound 
up with the Seventh Army .  I'm no
t quite sure of these details.
 
Q:   And now you're in Southamp ton?
 
A:   Southamp ton, waiting for the invasion
.  We were in Southampton I guess it must 
have been about a mo
nth until the invasion.  And we we
nt over about D-plus 10, 12, 
something like that.  D-Day plus 10. I wasn't
 part of the initial invasion.  But it was a 
little harrowing.  And we got stuck on a sand 
bar. And finally they got us off and they 
were bombing us and so on and 
so forth. From there, we la
nded on Utah Beach.  I didn't 
even remember the beach
 until I sort of looked it up for my  company.  Utah Beach.  And 
then from there, we sort of went in
land through th e hedgerows and so on.
 
Q:   At this point, did you 
know anything ab out wh at was happening to the Jews or did 
you know anything about camp s in general?
 
A:   Absolutely not.  We were so busy embroi
led in what we were 
doing because we were 
under fire here and there, bombardments and 
so on.  And I didn 't have time to worry 
about anybody else bu
t myself, actually.
 
Q:   What was it like for you to
 see dead bodies at that p o int?
 
A:   Oh, that 's when we went into Ge
rmany.  We had gone into Germany through 
Aachen.  I rememb er that.  And somebody sa
id to us, "Hey, fellows, you better get up to 
this camp.  There are a lot of dead bodies 
up there."  A civilian to
ld us. And we went 
there.  And those are the pictures that I show
 you of what we actual
ly saw.  They never 
even had a chance to pi
ck up th e bodies.  The bodies di
dn't even smell ye
t because they 
were so new. The Germans had left voluntar
ily because they were afraid of who was 
coming.  And they took off.  A
nd we got there about an hour 
after they had shot a lot of 

the people.  And we saw ovens -- I saw them my
self -- w ith bodies piled in front of the 
ovens.  The ovens seemed to be too small for 
the bodies. But then there was a ravine with 
a bunch of bodies in that they
 had spread lime on.  And then it began to dawn  on me what 
I was looking at.  And then I became a Jew.
 
Q:   We'll talk about 
Ohrdruf in a moment.  Let's go back
 a little bit to France.  Anything 
else -- any other combat experiences or any 
fighting that you went through in  France?
 
A:   Well, we were bombarded.  And during th
e Bulge, the Germans we
re really shooting.  
We weren't an infantry outfit; we were an engi
neer outfit.  And we had to move back into 
France until the invasion was over, the German
 invasion was over. And then as they 
cleared it up, we began to move in.  And when
 we first got into Germany, it was -- really, 
there were snipers firing at us and so on and 
so forth.  But I was never in any real hand-
to-hand or person-to -person combat per se.
 
Q:   Did you see any dead bodies at that point?
 
A:   Oh, all along.  In France we always sa
w dead bodies.  I'm ta
lking about dead bodies 
of Germans.  And all the way th ro
ugh, we had seen dead bodies.
 
Q:   How did you feel about seeing a dead body?
 
A:   At first, I was appalled.  And after 
that, strangely enough, 
you get used to seeing 
bodies.  You don't pay any attention to them.  
And if there's an odor, you walk  over to the 
other side, but you leave the bodies there. We we
re just -- it's a matter
 of survival, really, 
being in the service under those conditions. An d you'r e worried about yourself.  That is, 
until I got to the concentration camp.
 
Q:   Was your unit made up of other Jews?
 
A:   We had some.  We had a few Jews there.
 
Q:   Did you stick together with them
 or did you mix with everybody else?
 
A:   Not really.  I had two basic friends
 who were Jewish -- three.  One was the 
lieutenant.  The other was -- the other two were
 buddies of mine.  And we sort of -- the 
three of us stuck out together.  The lieutenant,
 he was sort of in another category.  And 
we went places together.  We 
did things together and so  on.
 
Q:   Did you ever talk among yourselv
es about wh at was happening to Jews?
 
A:   No.  And that surprises me.  I'm so dedi
cated now to that sort of thing.  I wasn 't 
before.  I really wasn't.  And it's  been sin
ce the site of the holocaust, since being in the 

concentration camp, that I really became Jewi
sh.  As a matter of fact, my  son didn't want 
to be bar mitzvahed, but I made him become
 bar mitzvahed and so 
on.  These two girls 
that I brought with me
 are fairly religious.
 

Q:   All right.  Now you'v e cro
ssed over the border into Germany.
 
A:   Well, I think the first town I rememb
er was Aachen.  And then  we moved past 
Aachen and we were told about the concentration camp wh
ich I just told you about.
 
Q:   Who told you ab out the concen tration camp ?
 
A:   A German.
 
Q:   A German person or a German townsperson?
 
A:   Yeah.  See, I can understand German a 
little bit because I spoke a little Yiddish.  And 
I was amazed to find out that I could talk
 German. As a matter of fact, I became the 
interpreter between the German
s and my outfit because the 
boy, "Hey, Bitter, he talks 
German."  I was really talki
ng Yiddish. That's  where we fo
und out, and that 's w h ere we 
went to the concen tration camp .  There we
re a few of us. I don't rememb er who th ey 
were.  I know th at my  two buddies were am
ong th em but I don't rememb er who else. And 
then we saw the bodies --
 
Q:   Wait.  Let's back up a little bit.  All 
right. This German townsperson tells you that 
there is a camp.  And so what 
was the next thing that you did?
 Did you report this to your 
superior?  What happened?
 
A:   No, no.  We just -- a bunch of us went 
to where we -- he said 
there was a lot of dead 
bodies there.  We didn't know whether they
 were Germans or Jewish or Americans or 
anything, so we went there.
 
Q:   How could you leave your unit?
 
A:   Well, we were all spread out.  We 
were in various vehicles and so on.  And 
reme mb er, I was in an outfit with 100 men and 
we were attached to various divisions.  So 
it was no problem.  They just told us 
where it was, and we drove up there.
 
Q:   What was your rank at the time?
 
A:   Corporal. And we drove up there.  And there was --
 
Q:   "We" being who?
 
A:   The two buddies that I had, 
Jewish boys, Elliot Bass and Abe Corn.
 
Q:   Why did you want to go there?
 
A:   Only to see what was there.  We were to
ld there were bodies.  And we had to find out 
what they were, whether they
 were Americans, whether th
ey were Germans, whether 
they were -- we didn't know
 anything about, really, the c
oncen tration camps.  We did not 
expect a concentration camp per se.
 

Q:   What was the name or what were yo
u told that the name of this location was?
 
A:   He just told us where it was.  He di
dn't give us any name or anything like that.
 
Q:   How did he describe the location?
 
A:   He says, "There's a camp with bodies 3 
miles away up this road."  He says, "Why 
don't you go up there and lo ok at it." See, th
e Germans were terribly afraid of us. They  
didn't  want to be tortured.  They  thought th at maybe we would co me in and torture them.  
And of co urse, we weren't looking to cause a
ny havoc.  So  we wanted to see what the 
bodies were that were up in this camp.
 
Q:   What date was this?
 
A:   I don't remember the date
.  It was right after we went into Germany, after the -- better 
still, it was the daybefore 
Eisenhower, Bradley, and --
 
Q:   Patton?
 
A:   -- Patton were there.  Of course, they came later.
 
Q:   So this mu st have been Ap ril 11th because they came on Ap ril 12th, 1945. Did you 

know the name of the place before you went?
 
A:   I found out later.  And that's one of th
e things that bugged 
me because we didn't  
know where we were, just that we were past
 Aachen and that there was this camp.  And 
the pictures will show you exactly what we 
saw as we went through the fences.  There 
was no resistance.
 
Q:   Okay.  You are three young soldiers in a Jeep?
 
A:   Yes.
 
Q:   And you are driving up this road .  What's the first sight that you see?
 
A:   We saw this fence, which was a barbed
 wire fence.  And as we drove in, we saw 
bodies lying all over the area.  And we coul
dn't believe it.  We didn't even know th ey 
were Jewish or anything like that.  We just 
saw the bodies. And then  we went in.  And 
there were a number of people who were alive.
  A number of people.  And th ey began to  
yell in Yiddish to us.  And I 
understood Yiddish.  And I bega
n to talk to them and they  
began to tell us what went on, what camp  it 
was.  And this was all new to us.  We had 
never experienced anything like this. And th
ere was one Polish boy in that camp who 
spoke Yiddish.  And surprising
ly enough, he had a bicy cle.
  And he held onto  that 
bicycle.  And he was the one 
that showed us around from 
place to place, showed us 
where they slept, showed us where the bodi es were.  And we were just absolutely 

appalled.  That was a real revelation.
 

Q:   You had a camera with you?
 
A:   Yes.  I always carried a camera.
 
Q:   And you so you took pictures?
 
A:   Oh, yeah.  It was after an hour or 
two of being th ere that we took th e pictures 
because this Polish boy wanted 
food or whatever he wanted.  
And he took us around to 
the camp.  And we wanted to 
see what it was. I had my camera with me all the time.  And 
he took us into a -- these long co ttages where 
they slept. Unlike what
 I've seen in the 
movies, these were like stalls for cattle, real
ly.  And there was a wooden bar in between 
the stalls.  And they were pack
ed with hay. And th at's where 
they slept.  They slept one 
right next to another.  You co
uld barely move in the stalls
.  And we went up and down. 
And then  we saw the bodies in the Œ outside the 
ovens. I didn't  see a 
crematorium there.  I 
didn't  know whether they were gassed or -- we
 didn't think of asking these questions.  
And then  he took us to this pit where ther
e must have been 500 
bodies, something like 
that, covered with lime. And what they were 
going to do with these 
bodies is throw them 
into the pit because th
ey couldn't  burn all of them.  
They were going to throw these 
bodies into the pit, but they
 didn't have time.  There wa
s no time because the Americans 
were there.  And they  didn't know who we 
were.  All the Germans knew was that the 
Americans are coming, let's get out of here.  
And there wasn't a Germ
an in that camp as 
we walked in.  But we see the Jew s firsthand.
 
Q:   What was your feeli
ng wh en you first heard Yiddis
h word s from these prisoners?
 
A:   I'm just trying to think.  It was -- I wasn
't really affected yet, but I began to talk to 
various -- and of course, there was some 
communication problem because a lot of the 
Yiddish that they spoke, I didn'
t speak. For example, one of 
the Jewish guys we had with 
us, we used him as a KP.  And he said to 
me one day -- we gave 
him a room when  we 
came into this town.  And he said to me
, "Do you do you sp eak Yiddish?  All right. 
Komm zu mine Zimmer."  He said, "Come to
 my room."  He wanted to show me 
something because we were Jewi
sh, and so on and so forth. 
And I says, "Okay.  I says, 
"But was is dat Zimme r?"  I had never hear
d of the word "Zimmer." He says "It's 

Zimmer," and he showed us.  A
nd he took me up to th e room that he was staying in. And 
I says, "You mean a room?" And this is th
e truth because there are certain idiomatic 
expressions that pick up the language.  I never knew th at a room was a Zimm er.  And so  

that's the kind of Yiddish.  I spoke a fractur
ed Yiddish but enough to understand what 
was going on.
 
Q:   How did you feel when  they  spoke Yi
ddish and you realized that these prisoners 
were Jewish?
 

A:   It didn't quite hit me immediately or anyt
hing like that, but I began to feel it.  And it 
was only wh en I met these girls that I began to
 realize w h at had -- the bodies, of course, 
you can't misinterpret.  But I began to underst
and what was going on in this place, what 
was going on in  Germany.
 
Q:   What was the condition of the bodies
?  Had they  looked like they had endured 
starvation?
 
A:   We didn't look that closely.  They were
 dead, and they weren't dead very lo ng.  We 
assumed that they had been shot.  They  may ha
ve been shot just befo re we came there.  
But they couldn't  get rid of all of them. An
d that was not a big camp .  It was a small 
camp.  But there wasn't enough 
time to get rid of all of them.
 
Q:   When  did you know th e name of the camp ?
 
A:   I'm not quite sure.  I think it may have been  wh ile I was there somebody may have 
mentioned it or something like that.  I'm not 
quite sure where I lear
ned the name.  But I 
never heard the name after I left until I began 
to ask people and try to research and find 
out whether there was a camp like that.
 
Q:   And the name of the camp ?
 
A:   Ohrd ruf.  O-D-H-R-U-F, something like that.
 
Q:   So you learned the name of it, you sa
id, when you were ther
e, that it was Ohrdruf?
 
A:   Yeah.
 
Q:   All right.  You have seen these bodies
.  You walk  around.  Any other impressions 
that you can talk about?
 
A:   Well, we were there just a good part of 
the day.  No w, it wasn't our job to remove the 
bodies or do anything else.  
We had to contact I think it was the civil govern ment of the 
U.S. Army.  They would come in and take care
 of the government and so  on and so forth.
 
Q:   But you said that there were a lot 
of other American soldiers already there?
 
A:   From my company.  We were the first 
company to walk 
in there.  There must have 
been -- in my comp
any, there mu st have been  25, 40 guys.  And of course, the word  
spread after that that there 
was this camp.  And that's where Eisenhower mu st have found 

out about it and so on.  But they  came the next day.
 
Q:   How do you know that?
 
A:   I saw them.  I was there.  In other wo
rds, we went back.  We didn't stay far from 
them because we were bivouacking, actually
.  And we went back.  And we didn't know 
they were co ming. And all of a sudden the 
gates open up and an en tourag e comes in, 

maybe 100 or 200 people.  I do
n't know.  And of course th
e bodies had remained there 
overn ight.  There was nothing we could do.  
And they came in and they were looking 
around and the cameras and all th
at sort of jazz. And th ey went through the place.  And 
somebody was explaining to them what had ha
ppened and so on.  
In other words, the 
hierarchy of the military had 
come in, and they learned ab
out what happened and they 
were showing it to the general. And I believe 
that was the first camp , maybe the only one, 
that the three generals were there.
 
Q:   So you actually 
saw General Eisenhower?
 
A:   General Eisenhower, General Bradley. 
 I'm not quite sure about Patton.  He was 
there, but I didn't  quite see him.  He was so
rt of walkin g on his own, mo re or less. But 
Eisenhower and Brad ley were together. Wherev
er they went, they we
re together with a 
bunch of colonels and 
military muck-mucks or whatever 
they call them.  And they were 
explaining to the general what had happened  
there.  They had heard it from one of the 
boys. So then they repeated to
 the generals exactly what ki
nd of a camp it was, what it 
was, and so on.
 
Q:   I'm sure you're aware of the famous 
quote from General Eisenhower that he wrote to 
Churchill -- and I'd just like to maybe read it a 
little bit and see what your reaction is to it 
-- that he sent in a letter to
 Churchill after he had been at
 Ohrdruf. "The things I saw 
beggar description.  The visual eviden ce an
d the verb al testimony of starvation, cruelty, 
and beastiology were overpoweri
ng.  I made the visit deliberately in order to be in a 
position to give firsthand evidence
 of these things, if ever in
 the future there develops a 
tendency to charge these allegatio ns merely
 to propaganda." Wh en he said he saw 
evidence of starvation, cr
uelty, and beastiology --
 
A:   I don't know about beas
tiology, but I know cruelty, star
vation.  That's  something I 
had never mentioned, the fact 
that they were emaciated pe
ople. These people were skin 
and bones.  And we tried to help  them, but we
 didn't have food with us.  We had some K-
rations and so on.  We did th
e best we could. And that's why we decided to come back 
the next day, to see if we could be of a
ny -- we didn't k n ow that the generals were 
coming.  And we brought back 
some food and so on and so fo
rth, but it didn't amount to 
anything. And we were just appalled by wh at
 we had seen. And really, I can 't h onestly 
say that it sunk in at that particular time. 
 The bodies, had they not been Jewish I would 
have felt the same way more or less at that
 time. And we went through.  We were 
interested in seeing. We couldn't believe th
at something like this existed, that people 
could be so cruel as to shoot them, starve 
them, hang them, which is in those pictures.  

We just couldn't  believe it.  And if anybo
dy tells you he realized what it was -- maybe 
Eisenhower did, but we didn
't until it began to sink in.
 

Q:   What did you say and what did the Je
wish prisoners say to you?  What kind of 
thoughts? 
 
A:   They were all anxious to tell me their 
stories. Strangely enough, Jewish people love 
to relate their problems and wh at had happened 
to them.  And those that could -- a lot of 
them were too weak to
 even talk. You know, 
they told us about wh
ere they came from, 
what had happened to  them, and so on.  Bu t th
ere were so many stories that one story ran 
into another. There were so many terrible stor
ies.  And they 're all mo st willing to talk 
And as a matter of fact, what I really found ou
t more than anything else were the girls.  I 
don't want to get too far ahead.  I really fo
und out what really ha
ppened.  They were 
explicit and they were able to
 explain. But as far as I wa
s concerned, we heard so many 
stories at the same time, all terrible stories. 
 And it's like somebod
y pricking your finger 
here, here, here, here, and yo
u couldn't  know where it hurts only because there are so 
many different spots that it hur
ts. And we had heard so  many 
terrible stories that there 
were too many to affect us, so to speak.  
I don't know if you can understand that.  But 
after a while, we began to understand what was going on.
 
Q:   Did your other -- the other sold iers that
 you were with speak Yi
ddish , the two others?
 
A:   No.  I was the only one that spoke Yiddish , so to speak.  And therefore, I was able to 
relate to so me of these people better than some 
of the others.  Of course, a lot of them just 
didn't  understand.
 
Q:   Did you touch an y of them?
 
A:   Oh, sure.  I held their hand.  I spoke 
to them. I sat with them
.  We were there for 
hours.  And then strangely enough, here 
are people who are dying, who -- we pick ed 

ourselves up and we left. It's a terrible thin
g not to realize the degradation that went on 

and the cruelty that went on. After all, we we
re in a war.  And yet we
 were able to pick 
ourselves up and leave.  I don't know if I coul
d do that today, leave back to th e bivouac 
area knowing th at we were going to come back 
the next day with wh atever we could.  
And it wasn't very much.  But 
then the military government m
oved in right after we left, 
and I guess they took care of them.
 
Q:   How did you know that you we
re the first Americans to come in?
 
A:   There was nobody else th
ere.  I'm sorry.  There was abso
lutely nobody 
else there.  
We walked in through the gates, opened up th
e gates.  They weren'
t locked. Rather, the 
gates -- the barbed  wire gates.  We opened th
em and walked right in.  We could see the 
scenes of the dead from outside the gates.  A
nd we just went in. An
d there was absolutely 
nobody there.
 
Q:   Were you frightened wh en you fi
rst saw the piles of dead bodies?
 

A:   No.  We had seen dead bodies all along.
  And we came in and we were just curious 
to know what it was th at we were looking at.  We really didn't  know what we were 
seeing, at the beginning.  And then  we rea lized. I may be contradicting my self but the 
thoughts are coming so
 quick and so fast.
 
Q:   This is Tape 1, Side B, of the intervie
w of Herbert Bitter. Before we continue, I'd like 
to clarify some facts that we talked about on 
the previous side.  You 
had said that you had 
come over the border 
into Germany into th
e town of Aachen.
 
A:   That's correct.  And th
en from Aachen, I just don 't re
member where we went because 
I was completely unfamiliar with Germany.
 
Q:   And then you eventually
 got to the vicinity of the 
Oh rdru f camp, and you said you 
were staying in a village and that a man to
ld you there's a camp 3 miles down the road.  

Do you remember th e name of the village?
 
A:   It might have been Erfurt
 or Aachen.  I'm not quite sure.
 
Q:   Not Aachen.  You mean --
 
A:   Excuse me.  
Erfurt or Ohrdruf.
 
Q:   Ohrdruf.  And then the other point we 
should clarify are the dates when you got to 
Ohrd ruf camp  and when you saw Eisenhower. 
 Because it is understood that Eisenhower 
was there on April 12th, which was the date th
at President Rooseve
lt died. Do you have 
anything to say about that, 
about when you were there?
 
A:   I certainly do.  I believe if I g o t ther
e on April 4th, which I think I got there, the 
following day, Eisenhower and Bradley came to
 that camp.  That was the very next day 
because the bodies were still 
there as we saw them the da
y before.  And they came and 
they looked over, and they had a small continge
nt of people with them.  I don't rememb er 
who they were.  And then they 
left. Now, th e next thing I know
 is that I saw pictures of 
the fact that Eisenhower was th
ere.  There seemed to be a 
lot of people there.  And th e 
day that Roosevelt died, he was supposed to 
have been th ere or Br
ad ley and Patton were 
supposed  to have been  there. Now, on the 
day that Roosevelt died, I was in Dresden.  
Now, I had seen the concentration camp on 
April 4th, I believe honestly, so that 
Eisenhower and Brad ley were there the day af
ter I was there.  And then they may have 
come back with photograp
hers and with whoever.
 
Q:   Okay.  Before we leav
e Ohrdruf, I just wanted to 
ask you again some of your 
impressions and other sites that you saw. Did you
 have a sense of the layout of the camp ?
 
A:   More or less.  As we came in, we sa
w the bodies.  To the right of the gate -- I'm 
trying to recall because these are things you r
eally don't forget -- were the barracks where 
the sleeping areas were laid out like in stalls
, like cattle, only they we
re low 2-by-4s that 

separated each bunk.  And that's 
all they had.  And they were
 filled with straw. And then 
we went from there.  We saw an oven, and 
there were a bunch of 
bodies piled up outside 
the oven.  However, the ovens s
eemed to be too small to handle the bodies. And as we 
went further, we saw t h is long pit where 
there must have been hundreds of bodies 
covered with lime.  And eviden
tly they were preparing to la
y the bodies into the pit so 
they could bury them and bodi
es above that and so on.
 
Q:   You are 25 years old, a young man, a
nd obviously not prepared
 for this.  How did 
you handle this or do you rememb er what 
thoughts were going th
rough your mind when  
you saw piles of bodies and ov
ens and lime pits and so forth?
 
A:   Well, it didn't quite hit me at that 
time, only because going th rough Fran ce and the 
invasion and everything, I had seen a lot of b
odies.  This was a terrible, terrible thing.  
And then of course we realized that they 
were Jews.  W e felt a little bad. But you must 
understand that it doesn't hit you su dden ly.  
You're looking and you 
say "That's a terrible 
thing."  And then you go on an
d so on. It's only after visiti
ng there, after being away from 
there that I began to realize.  And it was onl
y after I spoke to some girls who told  me 
what they had gone through that 
I began to realize that th is is 
true.  This is a holocaust.  
And it gradually over a period of time began to sink in .
 
Q:   Did you have any trouble sleeping  that night after you saw these sites?
 
A:   No.  Peculiar thing to say, I had no tro
uble at all.  Because re
me mb er wh en  y ou 're  in  
the service you're worrying about your own bei
ng, and nothing is important as taking care 
of yourself.  And I felt badly.  I can't say that
 it just passed over me. 
 We started to talk 
about it, some of the boys and us, and then  we began to  realize how terrible a thing it 
was. That's why wh en I see people who are not
 Jewish or people wh o don't care, they 
can 't believe it.  And I can understand why they
 can't believe it because it's too much to 
believe.  It's too mu ch to take in at once.
 
Q:   Did you feel any kind of ki
nship with the Jewish prisoners?
 
A:   Always.  Because I met 
Jews throughout Europe, I met 
refugees, I met a lot of Jews, 
and I spoke to some of them.  As a matter of 
fact, we had one Jewish refugee that we took 
with us, and he served as a KP, a kitchen pol
ice.  He served as a KP for us.  And I 
befriended him and we talked quite a bit, but 
we never really talked about details. He may 
not have known about all of thes
e things.  He was just a ref
ugee.  And we talked quite a 
bit because I spoke -- I was one of the only 
people in my outfit that spoke Yiddish, and 
that's why I was able to communicate.
 
Q:   How old was he and wh ere did you find him?
 
A:   He mu st have been  ab
out 35 years old.  We found hi
m walking along th e road.  And 
he asked if he could be part of
 our outfit.  He wanted to get 
to Israel.  And we said, "Well, 

we're not going to Israel.  We're going in the 
opposite direction." He says, "Can I go with 
you?"  He says, "I have to ea
t."  So we gave him an Ameri
can unifo rm.  We set him up.  
Nobody knew who he was.  And I communi
cated with him on a regular basis only 
because of the Yiddish.
 
Q:   And wh ereabouts did yo
u find him?  What country ?
 
A:   I'm not quite sure.  It may have been in Fr
ance, but I'm not quite sure
.  It's just that he 
was with us for quite a length of time.  And ac
tually, when we came ba
ck to Marseilles to 
go over to the Ph ilippines for the invasion, we 
had to get rid of him 
because we couldn't 
go aboard  ship with him. So we had some of
 the boys put him in a truck, took him down 
to the shipyards in Marseilles. 
 They put him on a ship that 
was going to eventually wind 
up in  Israel.  And I never heard from him after that.
 
Q:   Do you remember his name?
 
A:   Meischer (phonetic).  Th
at 's a s mu ch  as I  reme mb er.
 
Q:   Had you heard of a place called Bu
chenwald when you 
were in Ohrdruf?
 
A:   No.  As a matter o f fact, I didn't know it was a satellite until I went to Yad Vashem, 
and they told me it wa
s a satellite of Ohrdruf.
 
Q:   Of Buch enwald?
 
A:   Of Buchenwald.  Excuse me.
 
Q:   How many days were you at -- in the Ohrd ruf area?
 
A:   Several days.
 
Q:   And how many times did you go back  to the camp ?
 
A:   We went back th e next day and possibl
y once mo re.  And then  we had to  move on.
 
Q:   Did you say that y
ou had brought food back?
 
A:   Yes.  We brought whatever we could br
ing back, but it certain l
y wasn't enough.  It 
was a drop in the bucket.  And we knew that
 the civil police were coming behind us 
because they had been notified 
and they had been to
ld about what we had found.  I didn't 
do th e notifying my self, but somebody di
d.  And I guess they eventually came.
 
Q:   So just to clarify, you're saying th at y
ou were one of the first 
to come into the camp 
because there were no other soldiers around?
 
A:   I think we were the first because there 
was nobody in  that camp when  we went in.  
We opened the gates -- the ba
rbed wire gates and we walked
 in.  And this is what we 
saw.  Those pictures that I showed you are what we saw.
 

Q:   Were there any dead SS?
 
A:   No.  Only civilians.  Only people who were
 either shot or died 
in some way, and then 
the few that were just wandering around the 
camp with no place to go and nothing to do.  
They were sort of lost
.  They were in a fog.
 
Q:   Did you feel any differently after 
this ex perience at 
Ohrdruf than before?
 
A:   I felt a kinship and a compassion.  But as I said, it didn't hit me until I had left the 
camps and I had spoken to some -- the Jewi
sh girls that I had met along the way.
 
Q:   Well, let's move on.  So you th en 
were ordered to leave that general area?
 
A:   Yes.
 
Q:   And wh ere did you then move?  Did you go eastward?
 
A:   Well, we went toward Cologne becaus
e I remember being in Cologne.  And the war 
was beginning to wind down. And on the way -- 
and I'm not quite sure
 where this factory 
was -- we came across a factory.  And really, 
I didn't come across the factory.  One of th e 
officers came to the h
eadquarters and said, "Hey, Bitter, 
are you Jewish?" I said, "Yeah." 
He says, "Boy, you're going 
to have a good time." I says, 
"What do you mean?"  He says, 
"I found a factory full of Jewish broads," a
nd that's  exactly the wa
y he put it.  And he 
says, "They can 't talk to anybody."  He said, 
"I can't talk  to them."  He says, "Let me 
drive you there and I'll pick you up." I say, "C
an  I be there that long?" He says, "I'll pick 
you up.  I'll come and I'll wait for you."  He
 says, "But Have a good time."  He was being 
very facetious. And we went there and the pict
ure that I brought with  me, the picture of 
the four girls standing outside th
is factory. And I went up to 
the, girls knowing that they 
were Jewish.  I said [Yiddish/German expr
ession] which means, "What are you doing, 
girls?" And they were so excited at the fact 
th at there was a Jewish soldier there.  They 
had never seen an American-Jewish soldie
r.  They had not seen
 anybody. They knew 
they were liberated because the Germans had 
left. And they grabbed me, literally grabbed 
me, pulled me into the building, and to ok me
 to the second floor.  And I heard screaming 
and yelling of the girls. And they  put me up on
 a -- almost like a stage.  And there were 
girls coming from all over the building. I swear 
to you, there mu st have been 100 to  200 
girls, all disciplined.  All sat down.  Th
ere was one girl who to ok charge, and she 
explained to them who I was. And we spoke in
 sort of Yiddish .  And then she said, "I 
want you to" -- in Yiddish she said, "I want you 
to hear the stories of some of these girls.  
I want you to know what we went through.
" And I says, "All right." And I sat there for 
the next two or three hours just listening.  An
d each girl, she said, "Yanni  (phonetic), get 
up and tell your story.  Myrtle, get up and te
ll your story." And one
 by one, there must 
have been 20 girls, that ha
d -- and they to ld how they  had been raped and taken 
advantage of and all of that. 
 And I began to feel.  I wa
nted to kill somebody after 

listening to these girls. And finally they fi
nished.  They said, "Do you want to hear 
mo re?" I says, "No.  That's enough." And of 
course, I had to get back.  And the officer 
was waiting for me.  So I says, "Maidloch  (p
honetic), I'll be back tomorrow."  I says, 
"What can I bring you," 
I says, "in the way of food?" She 
says, "Food, we 're all r ight on."  
She says, "But can you bring 
us a few sidurim," prayer books. And I says, "Well, we 
don't have many, but I'll pick up every one 
I can find." And I went back and I got about 
three or four from the boys in the camp.  An
d I went back  the next day with some food, 
whatever it was, and the girls just couldn't 
get over me.  I was a hero.  I was the first 
liberator that they saw. And I spent a good part of the day w
ith them. I took my  own Jeep.  

And we spent some time, and then
 I left.  And of course, I took a picture with the girls or 
all the girls.  Here is th e Jewish girls liber
ated from the German factory, slave labor.  And 
it was interesting.
 
Q:   Now, can you tell me again where this factory was?
 
A:   It was after Aachen.  And I cannot re
member the distance.  
I can't rememb er the 
factory or what they  did in the factory, as
 a matter of fact.  But the whole building was 
full of girls.  Only girls.
 
Q:   How much later after Ohrdru
f did you come across this factory?
 
A:   Several days.
 
Q:   And were you head in
g eastward or westward?
 
A:   We were heading eastward.  We were 
heading eastward toward -- we wound up in a 
place called Weida, Germany, which was in th
e Russian section.  And we spent quite a 
bit of time there.  And then of course  we doubled back to go to Marseilles.
 
Q:   And you don't know wh at kind of factory it was?
 
A:   No, I have no idea what they  made. 
 They were so busy telling me about their 
experiences, not what they were, not -- but
 they  wanted people to know how they  
suffered.  And believe me, they let me know 
how they  suffered. And it was then that the 

whole thing was coming togeth er, that I began to 
realize what was going 
on in there.  It's 
not one incident that sets you ap art.  It's all 
of these incidents togeth
er.  And you begin to 
realize there's a pattern there.  And that's wh
at I began to realize. As a matter o f fact, I 
my self -- I don't know if I told you, I was s
itting in a Jeep in Fran ce.  And th ey had 
liberated some camps. 
 I think it was in Poland or somewh ere else.  I don't know.  And I 

read the article in Stars and Stripes.  And I 
read about how these people suffered.  And I 
closed the Stars and Stripes, put them away
, and I went about my  business like it didn't 
affect me in any way. 
 It does affect me now.
 
Q:   How long did you 
stay in that area of the labor factory?
 

A:   Two days.  I was there the first day.  I 
had to go and get on with the outfit.  So I was 
there the first day.  And then the second da
y I came back by myself with the sidurim.  
And I spent a good part of the day.  I had my
 own Jeep.  And then  I went back  to my  
outfit.  And that was it.
 
Q:   Did you talk about this with the -- Was 
there a chaplain that you could talk things 
over with ?  And if so, did you?
 
A:   No, because we had to m
ove on.  There was nobody I coul
d really talk to because we 
were an individual outfit.  We were -- we had 
to be attached to vari
ous armies t o  do the 
work for them and so on and so  forth.  So 
there was nobody I could talk to. And I knew 
that behind us was a civil a
nd military governments who we
re cleaning up and taking 
care of whatever we saw. And of course, 
the Germans didn't know any of this was going 
on.  None of it.  And they were very, very 
happy to see the American
s because they didn't  
want to see the Russians.  So they were very
, very happy to see us
 and welcome us.  And 
they had wh ite flags outside of all the build
ings.  And it was a very, very nice thing.
 
Q:   Why do you say that your experience 
at the women's slave labor factory made an 
 
A:   Because they were individual stories.  "I
t happened to me
," they say.  "This is what 
happened to me."  And then 
another one said, "This is what
 happened to me." And when 
you hear so many individual stories, not a gr
oup of people talking with one story, there 
are a group of people talking with many, ma
ny stories, that has to affect you ev en  if 
you're not Jewish.  And it affected me.
 
Q:   Were these women wearing yellow stars?
 
A:   I have to look at the picture.  No, th
ey weren 't.  Evidently 
the war or the Germans 
were in such retreat that they weren 't afra
id any more because the Germans had left.  
They were frightened, they di
dn't know wh at was going to  happen to them, and they 
began to run.  And basically
, they weren't wearing stars.
 
Q:   And then you left this factor
y.  And th en where did your unit go?
 
A:   And then we went on to Dresden, as
 I mentioned before.  And we wound up in  a 
place called Weida, W-E-I-D-A:  And we were
 bivouacked in a schoolhouse, and we 
spent the balance of the war th ere.  That's rig h t. Because we had to go from there to 
Marseilles. And in Marseilles,
 we were going to be put 
aboard ships and go to the 
Philippines for the invasion of Japan.  And I ha
d enough points to ge
t out and I was very 
mad and we were very irritated and so on and 
so forth. But while we were there -- we got 
aboard the ship, and we'r e all 
-- pardon me -- bitching.  An
d the ship took off.  And this 
was after Roosev elt had died. And Truman 
took over. And while we
 were aboard the 
ship, Truman declared all ships 
that are headed for 
foreign ports, military
 ships, to turn 
back and go to the n
earest American port. And I was one 
of the first troops to get home 

after we hit Newport News, VirginiA:  I was one
 of the first American soldiers that came 
in.  Excu se me. The war in Japan had ended, 
so they felt they didn
't  need us there any 
mo re and they didn't  want to an y mo re troops th
an they needed, 
so they sent us right back 
to Newport News. And I called my family 
and I told  them I'm home.  They never 
expected me to be home.  On ly my mother said, "Don't  wo
rry.  He'l l come home."  And I 
did. And I called the house and told them I woul
d be home in a few days.  They told us 
they'd  give us leave. So I said, "I'l l be hom
e in about two or three days." Unfortunately, I 
got what they call imp etigo, which comes from di
rt and filth.  So they had to change my 
unifo rm and put me in quarantin e.  And my  family had put up a sign, "Welcome home, 
Herbie."  And they had to ch
ange the sign because I didn't co
me back until a week later.  
And it said, "Well, come home, Herb
ie."  And that was it basically .
 
Q:   When  you got home, did 
you talk about Ohrdruf with fa
mily?  Did you talk about the 
labor factory stories?
 
A:   No, we didn't talk about 
mu ch of anything.  It came  out
 over a period of time.  I may 
have mentioned it but never an
y details.  I didn't want to talk about my time in the 
service.  I h ad so many other things that I 
wanted to do that I wasn 't  going to start -- 

actually a new life. I w as already married.  I wa
s married in Plattsburgh while I was in the 
service, which I didn't mention.  And I wa
s busy looking for a place to live because in 
those days you couldn't find an apartment at 
all in New Yo rk. And it was only gradually.  
I never spoke about that to my parents, for 
some reason or another.  Never. I sort of felt 
they wouldn't understand.  I may have mentioned one or two things, but I had spoken  to 

my  wife.  She would be the only one.  And my
 children. My children
 were the ones that 
were affected by this more 
than anybody else th
rough me.  And every time they went to 
school and they spoke about th
e holocaust, they insisted on ta
king the pictures.  That's 
why I have so few pictures left.  And th ey 
were more affected. That's why my daughter 
called you because she had heard these stories over the years.
 
Q:   Did you show these photographs that 
you had? When you first got home, did you 
show them to anybody?
 
A:   No, not really.  The only people that 
saw them was when  I we
nt to Israel and we 
went to Yad Vashem, they asked me -- when we
 found out that it was part of Buchenwald 
and so fo rth, they asked me whether I had 
pictures.  And they said, "Would you send me 
pictures?" And I made copies
.  Somebody had a machine that
 made copies, and I sent 
them the copies.
 
Q:   Did you show your wife these pictures
?  I'm talking about in
 the 1940s.  I'm not 
talking ab out later.  I'm saying wh en you firs
t came home.  Did you show your wife the 
photographs?
 

A:   She had seen them, I'm su
re.  It's just that I don't kn
ow the period of time that had 
elapsed.  I wasn't hesitant to talk about it.
  I just didn't want to go into any detail, 
basically. So my wife saw all the pictures. 
 And she speaks Yiddish
 pretty well so she 
understood basically what I we
nt through.  And I didn't 
talk about any gory details 
because I wasn 't interested 
in my family reliving it with
 me or anything like that.
 
Q:   Why not?
 
A:   Because I had lived it.  
They had seen the pictures.  Th
ey knew what I went through 
over a period of years.  We had always been
 talking about it. And I didn't sit them down 
and tell them -- first of all, they were too yo
ung, but it was over a period of years that we 
talked about it, we discussed it and so on.  So
 they know ever
ything that I went through. 
It's just that we didn't  do it in  one session or anything like that.
 
Q:   Did what you go throu
gh affect -- you had alluded to 
this before -- affect your 
feelings about being Jewish?
 
A:   I became more Jewish.
 
Q:   Why?
 
A:   Because I began to realize what thes
e people had gone through, and I began to see 
with my own eyes. And I told 
you, over a period of time it just
 sort of built up in me until 
I really began -- any ch ance I had to help holo
caust victims or whatever it is, we did. And 
we're very active. We have our own ch avur
ah, wh ich is a group of friends that get 
together that are all Jewish.  And my wife is
 very active in Hadassa
h, in all the Jewish 
organizations in Dallas.  And it's a difficult pl
ace to be Jewish, in Dallas, a difficult thing 
to be Jewish in Dallas, especi
ally when we first moved there.
  So she's very active there.
 
Q:   Can you just summarize what happene
d after the war, professionally wh at you did.
 
A:   After the war, I got myself a job and an
other job and a third job.  You know, I was 
sort of trying to find myself.  At the same
 time, I had a child a year after I came home. 
But then I worked for 
a large jewelry organization, and th
en I got a job with the PXs in 
Europe.  And we went to Japan with my  fami
ly.  We lived in Japan for several years, 
belonged to the Jewish Community  Center in
 Tokyo.  And we lived  in Yo kohama, and 
we spent three years in Japan. I came back
, went to work for 
a company that was a 
manufacturer's representative all over the world b
ecause I was used to tr
aveling.  I'm just 
trying to think -- Let's see.  Yeah.  After th
at, I went into business for myself, made a 
success of t h e business, and retired several year
s ago.  And basically, that's the story of 
my life.
 
Q:   Do you still thi
nk about what you saw, 
the sites that you saw?
 
A:   Always.  It takes the slightes
t thing to  remind me of what I saw.
 

Q:   Such  as what kind of things remind you?
 
A:   Well, when I hear abou
t the holocaust -- and in Dalla
s, in the Jewish Community 
Center, they have a holocaust mu seum.  Nothin
g like this.  But I go down there once in a 
while and look at the pictures. And a friend 
of mine -- I have several friends who are 
refuges who were in concen tration camp s.  An
d they'r e constantly ta
lking about it and so 
on.  And they make various talks throughout th
e schools in Dallas, trying to have people 
to be cognizant of what went on and so
 on, but there are s
till a lot of skeptics.
 
Q:   Are there any sights that trigger what 
you saw? Any sights that
 you see today that 
would trigger anything about Oh rdruf?
 
A:   Excuse me.  Mostly Eu rope.  When I see certain area
s in Europe, I think of the 
holocaust.  I think of wh at I saw.
  I'll never forget what I saw.
  In fact, what I've told you 
these are the only basic things that I rememb
er, but so mu ch mo re happened and so mu ch 
more that I went through that 
I can't rememb er.  And I wish I 
could.  That's why before I 
came to see you I wondered what I'm going to 
say to you.  I didn't realize I knew this 
mu ch .
 
Q:   You said you had kept a 
diary when you were a soldier.
 
A:   I had a diary.  I had a little desk that the carpenter in the outfit made for me.  And 
each day I wrote into this diary.  And then fo
r some reason we had to leave quickly, so I 
locked up the desk
 because I couldn't carry 
it with me.  And they 
were supposed to be 
picked up by a truck.  I 
never saw that desk again.
 
Q:   Where did you lose 
your desk and your diary?
 
A:   Probably in -- we left from Weida, Germa
ny, I think.  And it's w
ith the -- whatever is 
left of the 628th Light Equipmen
t records.  It should be w
ithin th at, and written by me.
 
Q:   So you wrote about what y
ou saw in Ohrdruf in this diary?
 
A:   I wrote a lot of what I saw.  A nd I do
n't rememb er exactly wh en  I stopped writing.  I 
just remember the desk  was gone.  I thought I would see it when I got to Marseilles, but I 
didn't .
 
Q:   Was it a release for you to be able to
 sit down and write about wh at you saw that 
day?
 
A:   Yes.  I began to reali
ze what I had saw -- seen, but for some reason or other it did not 
sink in until days, weeks later.
 
Q:   After the war and you were back here 
in the United States a
nd word  came out about 
the camps and there were more and more pict
ures, how did you respond to th at when  you 
saw the ma gnitude?
 

A:   That's when I began to realize.  That
's when I began to understand what was going 
on.  And the sights plus what I began to re
ad  about it all came together. And suddenly I 
began to realize what this was 
all about.  You just
 can 't look at it one time and say, well, 
this is a terrible thing.  It is
n 't that simple. It's 
something th at has to 
build up within you. 
And now nobody can tell me  it didn't happen or I 
don't believe it.  I know I saw it.  What 
I went through just trying to 
find out whether there was such 
a camp .  At first I began to 
say there had to be an Ohrdruf. 
 I was in there.  And every
body in Dallas, they told me 
no. The first trip to Israel th
ey said they don't k
now of such a camp. 
 And you know they 
have all the camps laid  out on a map.  
Never saw Ohrdruf until I went into the Yad 
Vashem.  Until they sh owed me
 the books. And they had th
e history of the camp there.
 
Q:   And it's a subcamp of Bu
chenwald and referred to as S3?
 
A:   Yes.
 
Q:   The first photograph th at one sees in th
e permanent exhibit here at the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum is a picture of 
Ohrd ruf.  Do you feel that's  appropriate?
 
A:   I don't quite understand you.
 
Q:   When the public comes 
to the permanent exhibit here 
at the United States Holocaust 
Memo rial Museum and they get off the elevat
or, the very  first photograph is of General 
Eisenhower at Ohrdru f and the scen e of the 
bodies at Ohrdruf.  
Ho w do you feel about 
that?
 
A:   I didn't see the picture, number one.
 
Q:   But the idea that that's the first one.
 
A:   Oh, yeah, because I knew he was there.
  Nobody could deny it, the fact that 
Eisenhower was there on th e second trip, I belie
ve.  Nobody could believe that this thing 
went on and yet people will still look at that 
picture and say, "It can 't be that bad."  They 

still do that today.
 
Q:   Is there anything else you would like to add?
 
A:   No, nothing.  If my memory im
proves, maybe I'll come back again.
 
Q:   Do you think you could 
have been prepared by anybod
y else for the sights that you 
saw?
 
A:   No, absolutely not.  Nobody -- I've told
 you, I read it in the Stars and Stripes.  Not 
that I didn't believe it.  It just didn't sink in
.  And th at's what happens -- and I'm talking 
about Jewish people as well. And 
everybody seems to sa y, "Well, 
it's not that bad. It can 't 
be that horrible.  There are a few bodies and 
there were some mean people there." But it 

existed.  And it existed on a mass scale b
ecause I saw how organized that was.  And 
believe me, the Germans know how to orga
nize anything.  And th ey organized that.
 
Q:   You said something that was very touc
hing, which was when  you went into  Oh rdru f 
and you spoke Yiddish to some of the surv
ivors and you sat down with them and you 
held their hand.  
Why did you do that?
 
A:   Well, only because I was curious to kno
w what went on.  We 
knew so little.  There 
was no history, you know, when I went in th
ere.  We knew so little.  So as I spoke to 
them, I was holding one of them and because 
he was an individual, not because he was 
Jewish, not because he was a
nything.  But because he wa
s a man who had su ffered and 
who had been hungry  and who was emaciated 
looking.  And these are men that needed 
somebody to talk to them.  It's
 just that I couldn't stay there too long.  That was the only 
thing.
 
Q:   Were you ev er concerned about your own 
health in these camp s with diseases and so 
forth?
 
A:   No, not at all.  We didn't think of any.
  We just saw what we saw.  We saw what was 
happening to somebody else, not to us.  And 
we looked  and we saw. And it was just -- it 
was a terrible sight.  I only wish I could have
 realized it then, but maybe I wouldn't have 
slept.  Maybe I would have 
been upset.  Maybe I would ha
ve become a nervous wreck. 
So maybe nature has it s way 
of comp ensating. That could be it. Of course one mo re 
thing.  When I go to Israel, I see so me of my
 relatives, my father's 
family.  And we talk 
about it.  And we talk about it, and we talk
 about what they went
 through. And they had 
left before the concentration camp business. 
 They all went to Israel.  And they all 
became very successful doctors and so on and so
 forth.  And we discuss it very rationally.  
They don't prefer to talk to
o much about it because they'r e 
doing well and they  don't want 
to be reminded.  Bu t they we
nt through quite a bit as well
. And I remember th e first time 
I went to Israel we took two bags of clothi
ng to bring to th em.  No
w they don't  need my 
clothing.  They're doing very  well.
 
Q:   Any message you want to
 give to your grandson or 
any sp ecial message to your 
family?
 
A:   The truth is that my grandsons got the me
ssage by virtue of the fact that I g ave them 
the pictures to take to school.  My children,
 my  grandchildren all took these pictures to 
school.  And wh at they did in school and how 
they reacted, they a
ll know exactly what 
happened .
 
Q:   Well, thank you very much for doing the interview. This concludes the interview of 
Herbert Bitter.
