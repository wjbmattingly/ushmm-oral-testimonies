Septem ber 1939.  You were 3 years old 
when war cam e to Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941.  Bef ore we turn to that time,tell usabout your

fam ily, your comm unity, what life was like in those years leading upto not justthe war, butwar in 
Yugoslavia.  
 
>>
 
Dora Klaym an: Tobegin with, I was born in Zagreb,and m y paternalf am ily was in Zagreb.  My 
m aternalfam ily was in the sm all town of  Ludbreg, which is im portant, because that's where I ended 

up. In Zagreb m yf am ily hadn't been there very long, but it's
 
the capital of  the city, hada vibrant 
Jewish population, very well integrated and highly educated, and not terribly Orthodox. T here was an 

Orthodox f action.  However, m y f am ily, I would say, were what we wouldnow call m odernOrthodox.  
 
 
My f ather, m yf ather and hisbrothers, especially one brother, werever y good at leading 
services in the synagogue, and so I thinkm y father cam eas such as a cantor, m aybefor high 

holidays to the sm all town of Ludbreg, and that's how he probably m etmy mother. T hough
, I'm  n o t 
to ta lly su re  of th at.  
 
 
My m aternal side of thef am ily in Ludbreg had beentheref or a very long period of tim e.  My 
grandfather cam ef rom what was C zechoslovakia, Ithinkf rom Slovakia, actually.  Becausethe 

comm unity, a small com munity, wantedandneededa rabbi. By the end of his life, which was in 
1942, he would have served as a rabbi of that congregationfor 40 years.  
 
 
He was, again, very well educated, hada doctorate, spokem any languages.  What is very 
unusual about that com munity, as
 
well as the com munity in Zagreb, is the sense of integrationand 
the sense of participation inthe com munity.  I'm  always struck by som eof  thephotographs, which 

ever ybody can get to see actually online, of my m other in a tennisoutf it with ver y m any non

>> Bill Benson: T he sam e school together? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: The sam e school, yes. The Jewish com munity was sm all.  I think at the time of 
thebeginning of the war, there about less than, orfewer than40fam ilies.  At one tim e, ithadbeen 
larger. W hat was happening in the Jewish comm unity as they wer e doing well, getting educated, they 
would go to the capitalcity or they would
 
--
 
many of  them actually em igrated,and so that the 
population kindof dim inished before,before the war.  But it was a totally integrated comm unity.  
 

>> B ill B e n s o n : T e ll u s a  lit t l
e bit about your father and mother's occupations.  Your f ather, I 
m entionedhehad a brush business.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasm uch more than that.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: It was a smallfactory, whi ch he had begun andwas doing well. 
 
I think there were 
som e 11 em ployees,and there was 
--
 
I sortof  remember the space, butnot very well.  T here is a 
photo, I think online also, of him sitting with the em ployees,but he him self  was in theoveralls and
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Manufacturing.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Manufacturing it, yes. T hey were m aking all kinds of diff erentbrushes.  
 

 
T he other,his other brothers,one who unfortunately did not survive,  was a ver y well
-
kno wn 
cantor. And one whodid survive, who played a large role inm y lif e later, Joseph, workedwith the 

Jewish Com m unity Center, which was af airly substantialorganization and still exists in Zagreb tothis 
day, in am uch sm aller form .  
 
 
By the time these people were adultsand wor king, theirf ather hadpassed away.  T hen the
 
m other,m y grandm other, actually passedaway of natural causesduring the war.  I think very early

during the war, and she is actually buried in Zagreb, and I canactually visit her gra ve.  She's theonly 
one.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he only f am ily m ember you
 
have a grave to visit?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: The only fam ily m emberwhose grave is in exist ence.  After the war, som e of the 
survi vin g m embers put a stoneupfor all the rest of the mem bers who had perished.  
 
 
Anyway, that's thef ather's side of thefam ily.  My m other was, in a sense, unusualfor the 
period in that she was a very good student, and she was sent ontoschool and shebecame a 
teacher, andactually workedfor abit of time in a sm all village where  there was an elem entary school 
near Ludbreg.  And asa teenager I wouldof ten run intopeople whowould say, " Oh, I know who you 
are.  Yourm other taught m e."   It was sort of  very nice to know that.  
 
 
She was very good at languages. She went to a teachers' college in a town that was very 
c l o s e  t o t he
 
Hungarian border.  It was the bilingual town. T here are a lotof  Hungarian spoken there. 
I hear shehad learned ver y fast to speak Hungarian.  
 
 
My grandfather, whom I mentioned before, who was the rabbi, was very good at languages, 
andhe served as a court translatorf or Hungarian and Germanform any years. Maybe I have 

in h e rite d tha t little tra it.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Five or six languages yoursel f .  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  YourAunt Giza and Uncle Ljudevit were essentialto your surv
i va l.   T e ll u s a  lit t le b it  
about them .

>> Dora Klaym an: That's an unusual story in that there we were in a small town and the oldest 
daughterof m y grandfather,m y grandparents, Giza, she was 15 years older than m y mother.  She 
was actually born in Bratislava, and m y mother later on in Croatia. 
 
 
She too was educatedto work in a bank,andthere shem et Ljudevit, who was 10 years older 
than she, and theyf ell m adly in love, andhe,as everybody else in Ludbreg besidesthe Jews, was 
Ca t h o lic .   
 
 
S o  it  w
as a rom ance that didn't seem  to com e to af ruition exceptm uch later. So they were in 
love, andf rom what I gatherm y grandf ather didn't allow them arriage tohappen.  However, in 1940, 
when they already knew what was happening in the restof  Europe,m y 
grandfather consented, and 
they went to Hungary and got married. W hyto Hungary?  BecauseYugoslavia did not have the 
institution of a civil m arriage, but Hungary did.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Only religious m arriages?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah, only religious m arriages.  But Hungary hadf rom  the old Austro
-
Hungarian 
system , they did allow civi l weddings, civil m arriages, so they went to Hungary to get married.  
 
 
So it was very late.  I think their courtship was about30 years long. 
 
[Laughter]
 
But they lived in a very sm all town.  I'm  sure they saw each other a lot, but I'm notasking any 

questions.  
 
[Laughter]
 
Interestingly enough, m y uncle, I asked him m any times,henever said it was my grandf ather who 

didn'tallow the marriage.  I heard thatf rom  other people.  He neversaid that.

>> Bill Benson:  Never said that?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  No.  He always said, Shewas quite happy living with her parents, and Iwas quite 
happy li ving with m y m other, it was f ine.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Dora, when Germ any launched itsattack on Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941, you 
happened to be away from  your parents in Zagreb on a visit with relatives in Ludbreg.  Tellus about 
the circum stances, to the best you can,about your being away at that time, and what happened once 
t
he Germans entered Yugoslavia.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, it was in the winter of 1941 that I was sent to visit with m y grandparents and 

m y aunts who lived inLudbreg.  I don't know to thisday exactly wh y, except som e neighbors of  ours 
were visiting, and m y m other said " Could you take her?"
 
So I rem ember the train, somehow, and I remem ber saying goodbye, and that was f ine.  
But I'm not sure whether they had suspectedthatthings would happen,or whether I was just sent on 
a vacation.  Because,at that tim e m y m otherhada baby, and soI was 3 years old andm y brother 
was a baby, and somaybe it was a nice tim e for me to go away f ora while.  I don't know.  
 
 
T hen in April, Yugoslavia was attacked, andbasically f ell apart within six days.  Alm ost as 
soon as 
the Yugoslavia arm yf ell apart,the king leftf orLondon. The arm y was justf alling apart 
totally,everybody was goingever y which way. 
 
 
A t tha t tim e , the  p ro
-
Nazi ri ght win g Ustasa cam e topower. T hef irst thing they did, because 
they came to power wit h Germ an help, thef irst thing they did is startthedeportations.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right away?  
 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

10
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Mm
-
hmm , pretty much right away.  All the laws were all of a suddenbeing 
passed, and it was all of the laws that Germ any had on the books, and so they just were com plying 
with  a ll o f th at.  
 
 
It was basically a gove rnm ent that was
 
--
 
people thathad been in Italy f omenting andf iguring 
outhow to get inpower, it was the right wing group, called Ustasa.  
 
 
W hen they came to power, one of the things that they did was startfollowing all of  the laws, 
the German laws. T hey im m ediately started som e deportations.  At that time, the cam ps hadn't even 
been built. T here were camps here, camps there, sortof  short
-
term gatherings or killings, but not the 
kind of organized thing that happened very shortly af ter.  
 
 
My parents were am ong the very earl y people who were arrested, and m y mother took the 
baby with her, and they were in basically in a jail in Zagreb. Therewas the place where Jews would 

b
e gathered.  And then a housekeeper of ours came to see if  she could take thebaby, andthey 
allowed thebaby tobe given toher.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  She went to the jail to see if  she could get your brother Zagreb?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah,m y brother. T henshe called the relatives in Ludbreg, and
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: W hich, of  course, is where you are.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W hich is where I was.  Thenm y Uncle Ljudevit, went to getmy brotherand 

brought him  back.  
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Before we go onf rom  there, thefact that your unclecould come to Zagrebandpick 
up your brother, was itbecause that he was a Catholic was the reason he could probably saf ely 
travel?  Do you know?

>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, yes, andof  course, I didn'ttalkm uch about him f rom before the war and 
about thatfam ily.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Chance to dothat, yes.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Let m e backtrack a little bit, yeah.  
 
 
So he was an incredibly well thought of, consideredperson in that town.  
 
>
> Bill Benson:  Pillar of the comm unity?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: The pillar of that comm unity.  He had served as them ayor.  Hehas a high 
position in the bank.  His fam ily hadbeen theref or quitea bit.  Hisf ather was already afairly 
we l l
-
known and respectedm em ber of the com munity.  And hism other'sf am ily was what they call sort 
of  am inor aristocracy.  So she hadactually inheritedalso somem oney.  So they were well
-
to
-
do by 
local circum stances, and educated.  
 
 
My uncle hadbeen sent away also to school, and he had adegree in econom ics, a version of  
it, I can't really translate that so well, but basically som ething like that. And he was also very m usical 
anda part of the comm unity asa whole.  He was part of everything.  He startedthef ire departmen
t.   
He ran a salonf orm usic.  He playedthe violin and conduct an orchestra.  He just was into 
ever ything.  
 
 
So he also was oneof the very f irst in Croatia to have a car. 
 
 
Going backhow to getto Zagreb,I don't rem em ber whether he still had his car or not, whether 
he took somebody else's or som ebody elsewent, butthis is what, in a way, allowed him  to
 
--
 
and he 
was Catholic, of  course, sothat allowed him  to travel and go there and get something.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  At that tim e be f ree of  harassm ent
?

>> Dora Klaym an: At that time, yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had other relatives in Zagreb, too, atthe sam etim e. Were they all rounded up 
at thatpoint?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, actually, one of m y uncles
 
--
 
no, they were not roundedup.  Andwh y no
t?   
Because they were, in a sense, roundedup. Oneonm y m other's side, theonly person who was 
there,and oneof m y father's side, they hadbeen in the Yugoslav arm y.  So they were taken as 
prisoners of war.  So they survi ved as prisoners of  war within Germany, actually.  
 
 
My t wo aunts, yes, they were taken,but I'm not sureat what tim e.  Ijust don't know thatpart.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had oneaunt I wanted to bring up. W as itAunt Blanca?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: That was in Ludbreg.  
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
I wantyou to talkabout her whenthe time com es.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  That was my m other's sister. T here was one uncle who survived because he was 
workin g f or the Jewish comm unity.  T he interesting thing is that the Germ ans, the Germansandthe 
Ustasa all keptthe Jewish com m unity f unctioning.  I'm  talking about the officeof  the Jewi sh 
comm unity, not the Jewish com m unity, but the off ice of the Jewish comm unity.  T hey kept it 
functioning because it was apparently a wa y they could keeptrack of things.  T h
at's where he 
worked, andhe worked there until 1943. T hat's a separate story.  
 

>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: I'll talk aboutthat story.  
 
 
Back to m y Aunt Blanca, if you wantm e to. That was in Ludbreg.  She was my mother's sister.  
She 
was married, andthefam ily ran a storeof textiles. T hey had two daughters,m y cousins. T he

four of them atone point lef t Ludbreg and could have saved them selves, as some otherpeopledid.  
Becausem any peoplewere escaping to Dalmatia.  
 
Da lm a t ia is  
the area, Ithink, theaudience probably has heard.  If anybody ever hears 
anything about Croatia, they always hear about Dubrovnik.  Youask anybody in Croatia, Have you 
been to Dubrovnik? That part near theAdriatic Sea,that's Dalmatia.  That was neith
er part of  the 
so -
called IndependentState of Croatia, nor was it Germ an.  It was Italian.  Italian in allof  this 
parcelling of  parts of the country, Italians got thatpart. They were in charge until Italy abdicated.  It 

was 1943.  
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Did n
'tyou tell m e that at one point
 
--
 
>> Dora Klaym an: They went.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywent, and Ustasa saidcom e back.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Nothing wi ll happen.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You'll be safe, come back.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: And they cam eback. T hey had been so well ensconced there.  They lived there 

all their lives.  They couldn'tfathom  som ething would happen to them . Everybody was believing 
things. T he Rom a,also persecuted, they wer e told they were going to be given new land,andthere 
were m any
 
Rom a around there.T hey justall nicely went, sat there and collected.  People believed 
th em .  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now, let's go back to you.  Your brother Zdravko isbrought back with your uncle, 
now you're in Ludbreg.  W hathappens then?

Dora Klaym an: W e're shuffledbetween the grandparents, aunts, unclesand soon,until 1942.  
1942 there was a big raid, andbasically all of the Jews were taken awa y.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In Ludbreg?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: InLudbreg.  Exceptfor my aunt, who
 
was m arried to am an who was Catholic.  
She was not taken in that raid.  Everybody else was.  And of  course, m y brother and I were not. And 
this is always a question:  Why weren't we taken away?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because everybody in the com munity knew you wer en't their children.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Everybody in the comm unity.  Ludbreg is a very sm all town.  It's af ew thousand 

people. Everybody kn ew there was only onesynagogue, one rabbiwho li ved there 40 years.  
Ever ybody knew who we were.  Yet, I was never taken. A., it's a miracle.  B., I think thatm aybe 
because it was not the local Ustasa, the localpeople who were doing the raids,but som ebody who 
had come. All of a sudden it was a garrison there,and they were st ationed thereand in charge of
 
t he  
raid.  
 
 
I thinkthey went by lists.  Since we were notfrom  thattown, we wer e not on the list. This is 
m y assumption. T hose two kids running aroundthere, they were lef t behind.  
 
 
I ver y clearly rem em ber.  That'sone memory I have. This was 1942
.  B y th a t time  I wa s 5 . I 
do rem em ber everybody leaving and cryin g and hugging and saying goodbye and carrying little 

satchelsand pillows.  We were lef tbehind.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Sof orthem om ent, you weresaf e. But thenalso, I think in1942, thepi
l l a r  of  t he  
comm unity, your uncle, who is taking careof you, he isarrested.

>> Dora Klaym an:  Hewas arrested too. W ell, in that town, one of the things happening inthat tow
n 
is that
 
--
 
oh, it was happening in the country, is that the partisanm ovem enthad begun to gather 
people.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he resistance?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Resistancem ovement, yes. T here were so
-
called partisans. There were people 
who just did not want to see what they calledtheoccupator succeed. T here were people who were 
comm unists, who when Russia was attacked, they certainly were going to go do som ething about 
that. T hey were sort of not communists in the wa y that we thought about it after, during the cold war, 
but the kind that people there thought in kindof  idealistic term s.  
 
 
Jews, people were gathering in the mountains and trying to get whatever arms they could,and 
tryin g tof ight.  And Ljudevit, among other people were accused of sy
m pathizing with the m ovem ent, 
which of  coursethey did surreptitiously, at one point they decided to gather some of the pillars of  

comm unity and sendthem to whatalready was now established asa big camp, which was a horrible 
place, Jasenovac.  It was a horrible place.  
 
Most people know Auschwitz and Machausen, but this was small incom parison to those 
cam ps.  It was ver y lar ge for that area, in thenumberof  people killed there. It's not known by m any 
people. But it was one of them ost vicious adm inistrations that ran that camp. People were being 
killed in every which way.  
 
 
I'm  told that when m y grandfather cam ethere, that they didn't even come to go through the 
gates.  Somebody hit him  on the head and killed him  right there.

People talkabout, youknow, slashing throats andhitting people with shovels.  It was justan 
awf ul cam p.  People were starved to death, worked very hard.  My uncle ended up there.Diff erently 
f rom  Jews who were herded in and killed, som eof  the Catholic Croats who went there were accused 
of  som ething and told they would have such

>> Bill Benson:  For your uncle it's more like a prison? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: It was aprison.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  He gets a sentence. OK. 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Sowhen he gotthere, they f igured out thathe was abanker, and so they put him  
to work in a place which actually allowed him to survive, which was s om e kindof anoff ice. It was still 
he was hungry, buthewas al ways ver y f rail, andhe wouldhave never sur vi ved hadhe been doing 
what m y f ather was doing.  
 
>> Bill Benson: Who was also there?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ho was also there.  My m other died very early,  apparently, I think of typhus.  My 

father survi vedf or a very long period of  tim e. Uncle Ljudevit who wa s there
 
saw m y f ather. W hen he 
returned, he did return, he toldus thathe saw m y father, who was working very hard, carryi ng bricks 

andthey were building things.  
 
 
T he prisoners had to build their own furnaces and do all kindsof other work.  So I know that 
m
y f ather was there,and I know that m y uncle was thereand that he managed to survi ve thatperiod 
of  time with som epeople who were fairly kin d tohim , who ended up in prison after the war.  They

You had to goout of the houseand openthedoor and godown intothe cellar.  T he cellar had 
earthenf loor, and shelves, shelves full of  drying f ruit, mounds of sand where you bury potatoes and 

carrots. T here were big barrels, because wehad a vineyard.  The vineyard produced grapes at the 
endof  the year, they would press the grapes,put the wine inthese barrels.  There were barrels full of

were thick walls, and the tiny windows were all the way high up. So you were pretty saf edown there.

Dora Klaym an:  Right.

>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, eventually, as I said, sincem ostof  the Jews were gone, they wer e gone, but 

there was som ebody at one point that denouncedm y aunt. T here isa thought that we knew who that 
was.  Eventually later, on, m y uncle tried to do som ething aboutthat person, but unf ortunately he was 
able to run toAustria after the war and savedhim self .
 
Somebody denounced her, andthey cam eand 
arrested her.

what happened to youand your brother?

T his isaf ootnote I'm going to say now, because we didn'tever talk about it bef ore. 
 
Bu t after 
m any,m any years, I just got that back. W hy? W hy didn't Ihave it bef ore?  Because after the war, 
the comm unist governm ent had conf iscated it, and then it was conf iscatedf or all these years, and 
then now the governm ent recently, like maybe 10
 
years ago, after thefall of  comm unism  startedto

Serb Orthodox. W ehad som eSerb Orthodox villa gers, who im m ediately all joinedthe partisans.  
T hey were sort of in that area. They also,m any, m any SerbOrthodox people in larger num bersthan

, OK .  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: They knew who we were, and they knew it was pretty dangerous tohave us.  But 

because it was not allowed to give shelter to Jewish children or anybody, but they were wi lli ng to take 
us in. It was a couple with three children, who
 
were m uch older than we.  Theoldest, they were 
teenagers, two teenagers.  The oldest one was def initely a teenager, andthere was a courtyard that

I don't know, children seem  to be

to do so.  So I knew, Iwas old enough to know if  anybody was there that we didn't know, Iwould call 
her mom, but if  she
 
had ever gone, I would call her Mrs.
 
Runjak.  My brother, who was m uch young, 
three years younger, he couldn'tdistinguish onef rom  theother.  Sohe always called hermom . T o 

his dying day. W e'll get to his death.  Anyway, healways called herm om .  
 
 
T hey were ver y kind, wonderfully kindf am ily.  Mr.

>> Bill Benson:  Atone point, you were baptized, right?

Dora Klaym an: The Runjak fam ily, because they were ver y close, very devout fam ily, apparently 
thepriest said to Mrs.
 
Runjak,according to this oldestdaughter who is still alive, or she was in 2010

Dora Klaym an:  Right.  Right. I don't know how exactly it went, Inever questionedm y uncle later

Giza and he's not able to do soand save her,he com es back.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hat happens then?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Som ehow we m uddled until the end of the war.  Ludbreg was liberated af ew 
tim e s. I th in k t
here were these constant battles.  Some of the battles were pretty awf ul, and som eof  
them  were still while m y aunt was alive.  T hat's wh y I rem em ber so vividl y, becauseour house was 

across the streetf rom  another house that was two stories, and there were people shooting, one 
group shootingf rom  our backyard and theothers shootingf rom  that secondfloor, and thebullets 
were f lying through our windows.  T hat was the time we were not

m y uncle cam

to see, to comf ort me, andthe bulletf lew righ t intothe window and right throughhis head.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W here hehad justbeen?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  Ina way, that saved his life.  After the war, you can take a look at our 

house, there were
 
holes everywhere in the living area. W ehad thisbig Europeanarm oires and they

were pierced with bullets.  If  youtook out atablecloth or sheet, it was like when childrentake a 
napkin, you cut it up, that's what this looked like.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said to me when wef irst m et that,for you asachild, yourf ear was getting shot 

and killed in battle, asopposedto worries aboutdeportation,because it was so tangible and real.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  That was ver y tangible, ver y real. W e lived with it a lot. T herewere reall y 

badbattles. There was one on m y street.  My street eventually got named after that one 
neighborhoodthat got decimated. The Ustasa and Germ ans had som ehow surrounded a brigade of  
partisans within the street,and they fought andf ought andfought,and at the endthey ran
 
--
 
the 
partisans ran outof m unition. They took the last bombs they had, and detonated them amongst 

them selves, and we knew in what house.  It was sort of a last houseon the street.T hey just 
co mm itted
 
m ass suicide.  So that street was later on renamedthe 17thbrigade.  
 
 
T hen in them orning you would wake up, youdidn't know who was in  charge.  You looked 
through the shutters to takea look,f igure outwho was there.  Ihave terrible memories of horse
s 
pulling cartsf ull of bodies justpiled up,nakedbodies piledup.  So there were just thesebattles.

Changed ina sm all way.  I thinkthey were two periods of afairly long periods, 
m any months, that thepartisansheld the town. T hat was very nice.  Toward theend there was a 
re a lly
 
--
 
they were reall y starting to f igurethey were losing.  At one point,
 
they invited the headto 
com e totown, and of course,everybody was going to go and see what's happening.  I remem ber 

wanting to go, and I wasn't allowed to go. Infact, I could justhear out through the window.  
 
 
Oneof  the things that was interesting aboutm e standing out, andm y brother, and how 
m iraculous it was that no onetook us ever, Im ean sentus away, kil led usor whatever, that both of 

us, you can't tellnow, but I was a bright redhead.  So was m y brother.  It's very unusual in Croatia.  
T he r
e are really no redheads.  W e really stood out.  
 
 
I remember when Pavelic came, I was told not to go out anywhere without a hatonm y head.  
It was summ ertim e. You just had to keep out of  their way.  T hen doever ything you were s upposedto 
do, even when 
there was school.  I was tryin g to go to school at theendof  the war, and Ihad to go to 
church on Sunday, I would m arch in and try to remember some songs or som e prayers, which, of 

course, they taught me.  So there were periods it was OK, and thenperiods where it was very 
f rightening.  But you kind of muddledalong.

T here was one on m ym other's side of thef am ily, the only survi ve on m y mother's side of thefam ily.  
On m yf ather's side of the fam ily one member survi ved.  Both of them  survived as prisoners of  war.  
 
 
I was told,m y uncle said, W ell, it's up to you.  Here I was 7 years old, and I said, I'm  not going 
away.  Because I didn't know who thesepeople were.  I love m y uncle.  He wasf antastic. He was
 
--
 
it  
was obvious he lovedus very m uch. W e were all he had left. Oneof  the things I
 
hadn't said bef ore is 
thatthis wonderfulf amily of  his,his aristocratic m other,they all diedyoung, ever ybody.  T here was a 
hugef am ily, andtheyall diedof  tuberculosisor inf ections or something.  
 
 
He was actually the only sur vi vor in thatfam ily. 
 
So he certainly was n't

didn't want to give m y

of m y uncles lef tf or Israel. T hey both remarried. W ell,one rem arried, his wif e was killed. T he ot
her 
hadnever m arried before.  Hemarried, alsoa Yugoslav sur vi vor.  
 

 
T hey all left. So that was just thethree of us lef t,and unfortunately my brotherdied in 1946, 
ver y suddenly, like within three days, of  scarletf ever, because we had really noanti
biotics and he 
apparently had a weak heart, and that was that.

Because I was a kid of 9, andI don'tthink I quite understood.  Butto him, it was am ajor loss and 

he

My brother was a very cute kid, andI think probably

wh y I didn't grieve so m uch, I was so jealous.  He was younger, but he was very sm art, very cute, and

It was a great loss,and it was a great losstom y uncle. On theother hand, he never rem arried, and 
so it was we hadm aids, housekeepersand housekeepers andm aids.  Som e of  the housekeepers 
were reall y ver y interesting andeducated people who, after the war, had losta lot, losttheir fam i
lie s .   
T here was one in particular who was highl y educated lady, who had taughtme myf irst piano, taught 

m e German. I was always afraid m y uncle would marry one of them , buthenever did.W erem ained

If you have a question, please make it asbrief as you can.  I will repeat it so everybody

Dora Klaym an: The Serb Orthodox comm unities, Idon't really know how these particular villages 
were Serb Orthodox. T hey were obviousl y Serb people who had com e, who had emigrated tothat 

part of the world.  Much ofthe Serb Orthodox comm unity in Croatia
 
did not live in that part of the

world.  T hey lived through where, during this1992 war, there was alot of talk about wherethe 
m ajority lived, and it was mostly on the border between Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia, goingm uch 
furthereast.  But Idon't know
.  
 
 
T here were m any, m any Serb f am ilies that lived in what was Slavonia.  If you think of Croatia, 
sort of  likethe lay of the land is sortof  likea crescent,then inthe crescent that's very closeto Serbia, 
thatpart, where the east
-
northeast, that are
ais on theborderof  Serbia. T here were many Serbs 
living there.  
 
 
So in term sof  thedeportations, the Ustasa were deporting whole vill ages.  If  youtake a look at 
like when there was awhole archive at the Holocaust Museum thatcam ef rom the Jasenovac
.  T ha t's 
an interesting story in itself .  I was looking through that,and there are whole villages, a list af ter list 
af ter list of people that were deported. That'sbasically where they were.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  All right.  Do we have another question?  If you don't, Ihave tons.  Yes, sir?  
 

[Audience question]
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W hat was the relationshipbetweenm y aunt

wh at was the relationship to m y 
aunt who took me in? She was m y mother's older sister. There wer ef our children in thatfam ily.  
Th
ree girls andone boy.  Thef ellow was theone who did survive the was, butthe three wom en were 
killed. T he oldest one was Iza, that one. My m other was 15 years younger, andthen Giza's 

husband, Ljudevit, with whom  I lived, was 10years older than his life.  So imagine when I was 
gro wing up with him , itwas reall y
 
--
 
he was born in 1885.  I was really li vin g with som ebody who was 
m y grandfather's age.  W ould have beenm y great
-
grandf ather's age.  I shouldn't say that. He could 
have beenm y grandfather, because he was 25 years older than I. That sometimes was a diff iculty as

I was gro wing up, because I always used to think, oh, he doesn't understand, he doesn't understand

[Laughter]
 
>> D o r a
 
Klaym an: Peopleof ten ask me thisquestion, you know,W hat was it like living wit hout your

couldhave done. Hewas a fantastic person, ver y loving, and Inever lacked for love, which probably 
m akes me sanethesedays, as saneas can be, because Idid not really sufferf rom that kind of  
deprivation.  
 
 
On the otherhand, when I was growing up, I would say, oh, well, he's tooold,and if  Ihadm y 
parents
, well, you know, it would have beenthis, this,and that. Of  course, that's not true.  I was just 
objecting to having to cleanupm y room or som ething.

Bill Benson: T he question is because of how young you were, did you really understand all that 
was going on, wh y you had tom ove around,wh y you had to sort ofkeep your identity quiet? W hat 
did you actually understand, or were you shieldedf rom it?

> Dora Klaym an: I probably didn't understand very m uch. It was m ore like almost sometim es likea 
gam e. Like, you know, OK, youhave to go tothebasem ent,or OK,get ona train, don't say this, 
don't say that.  Ididn't know what the consequences could have been,nor did I
 
--
 
I certainly didn't 
understand the larger question of what was going on,I don't think. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Onem ore question, right here.  
 
>>W hen you were livi ng with thef am ily, you were li ving with a Catholic family and were bapt
ized, 
hadto go to church.  Did that affect your belief  system  at all, anddidit make your transitionwhen you 
cam e your uncle cam e home,backto yourfaith, diff icult ordiff erent?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  No,no, it was on them ic. It's OK.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, m y uncle, I sortof  became,for a while, very Catholic, becausemy f riends 

were very Catholic, and there were no Jewis h children.  So, you know, I would follow up and do 
ever ything that they did.  But then, very shortly, you know, we went under a 
comm un ist  syste m .  I  wa s 
7 years old. One period ended, the otherone began.  Not quite in the sam e way.  Under the 
comm unist system ,If ared reasonably well in term s of what happened to some otherpeople.  
 
 
Of course, underthe communist system all religion was taboo,basically.  So there goesm y 
Catholic belief s. I knew nothing about Judaism ,nothing at all. 
 
 
One thing we never got to, of  course, because there's som uch to say, is that whenI was 16 
andI was in high school, I hadtobe senttoanother town to gotohigh school to a nearby town.  I 
went to an academ ic high school,and I was boarded. Then m y uncle in Switzerland, who survi ved, 
theone working f or the Jewish comm unity, he survi ved, he went to Bergen
-
Belsen, they survi ved, 
they went to Switzerla nd,and he established contact with m e. T hey wrote ever y once ina while.

T he otheruncles kindof f orgotaboutm ef ora while, buthe wrote to me. They invited, he and 
his wif e invitedm e to visit with them  in Switze rland. At theage of 16,
 
I actually went to Switzerland, 
which was unheard of in Yugoslavia at that tim e.  You just didnot go toa foreign country under 
comm unist system . You couldn't get visas, you couldn't do anything.  I was considered what the 
Yugoslavians called a victim  o
f  f a scism .   
 
 
So I got a passport and visa, and I could take $5,and I was allowed.  And I went by train. My 
uncle waitedfor me on the border, and we endedupat their house. If ound myself in an Orthodox 

Jewish f am ily.  I'm  like, what is this?  You know?  I knew nothing. Absolutely nothing.  
 
 
T here was one Jewish fam ily thatdid come back toLudbreg, but they were nonobservant.  
T he only thing I knew is that atpassover, at this tim e it would a year, I didn't know exactly what it was, 
we would gets matza to eat. That'sabout it. T he Jewish community would send f rom someplace, I 
don't know where, probably f rom the States,we would get afew boxes of matza.  All of asudden,I'm  
in this Orthodox Jewish fam ily, but I was likefull of  wanting to learnth
in gs, so
 
--
 
and I liked them  very 
m uch, and really we discovered we really lo ved eachother.  
 
 
I went backhom e, butthey said,W hen you are atuniversity wh y don't you come study here for 
a while.  So I want topoint out that in your notes over there, there isan error. It says that Lozan is a 

sm all town in Croatia.  Nothing like that. It isaf airly large town in Swit zerland.  
 
[Laughter]
 
T hat's where Iendedup atthe university, m y second year.  First year I was in Zagreb, second year at 

Un ive rs it y o
f  Lozan studying French.  It's between Croatia,between Yugoslavia and Switzerland. 
T hat's how I m et m y husband.

>> Bill Benson:  I thinkwe probably shouldbring it to a closebecause ofthe time. Thank youfor the 
questions. The last question was a wonderf ul wa y to get in som ething we weren't going to get in, so 
I'm  gladof  that.  Before I turn itback to Doratof inish up ourprogram , I want to shareonething with 
you, becauseI want to share it with you. W edon't get tohear about af ter what Dora
 
just told about, 
she's now out of com munist hands and her uncle is still there, he was notable to leave.  But because 

Dora hasthism arvelous faculty with language, she is on atrain and there's some Am erican, 
Englishm en and others talking in English. One said" Oh, look atthat beautif ul redhead."  And she 
heardand understood.  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: I had been studying Engli shf orf ive years. T hatwas in high school I was studying 
English, but I didn'thave any chanceto talk to anybody.  Here are these guys in the hallway, 
discussing.  It was about Little Rock. I don't know if  the young generation remembers, thatwas a 
horrible time inthe United States when Governor Faubusdidn't allow black children to attend public 
school. Everything in Europe heard,
 
like, God, how horrible.  
 
 
T here was a discussion of that.  My husbandwas explaining, all Americans are like that,and 
so on.  Anyway, we m et, andtalked about various things, and sangMozart, did not exchange that we 
were both Jewish.  Henever expecteda Jew in Yugoslavia, and I never thought in those term s.  
 
[Laughter]
 
Because I knew nothing.  So thenI went to Swit zerland, he went to the States. W e corresponded. 
And throughthe letters we discovered who we were and got very cl ose through letters. 
 
I know that's 
hard inthe days of e
-
mail andf axes and tweets and soon. 
 
[Laughter]

So Ihave still a pile of  letters, which people who are tweeting wil l never have.  
 
 
So he cam e backandwe were m arried inSwitzerland in an Orthodox cerem ony.  
 
 
I 'm  b
ack to observing being Jewish, and I belong toa synagogue, andm y grandchildren were 
in barm itzvah, and I'm studying Hebrew.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wantto thankall of  you. W e have a 
F i rs t  Pe rs o n
 
program  everyW ednesday and 
T hursday through August.  Plea
se com e back. W e have a traditionthatour 
F i rst  Pe rs o n
 
gets the last 
word.  On that note, Iwill turn it backto Dora. W hen she'sdone, she will step off  the stage over here.  
If anybody wants to ask m ore questions, chat with her, just shakeher hands, I'll take a photograph, if  
you've got a cam era. Whatever you feel likeyou want to do.  Dora?  
 
>> Dora Klaym an: It's wonderful tohave youall here,and I want tosay that I have really appreciated 
workin g at thism useum , because I dof eel that the experiences we have had needtobe told and 

retold andthat we need to keep them em ory of  those who lost their lives ali ve, we need tokeepthat 

m em ory alive.  And we need to know what happened, sothat, hopefully, it won't happen again.  
 
 
Sometimes I doubt t
hat that is possible,and other tim es I'm  very optim istic.  Most of the time 
I'm  very optim istic.  I still believe in thebasicgoodnessof m an,andI thinkhaving you all here always 

reinforces that optim ism  of m ine. 
 
 
On the other hand, som etim es I f eel
 
Idon't really want to talk about m yself , and yet when I'm  
here Ifeel it was worth while and I hope youfeel sotoo.  It was good talking to you. T hank you for 

com ing.
