JAFFA MUNK
 
October 8, 1996
 
 
 
I: what was your name at birth? 
 
S: My name at birt h was Noemi Donath 
 

I: and where were you born? 

 
S: I was born in Onod, which is the county of Borshod(?). It is about nine kilometer or 
nine mile from Mi shkoltz. 

 

I: And what was your date of birth? 
 
S: My date of birth was April 10th 1931 

 

I: Would you talk about your childhood?  
 
S: Yes, I grew up as the daughter of a rabbi, m y father was a rabbi and twenty six little 

towns belonged to his congregation. I had a beautiful childhood growing up among three 
brothers and sisters. The name of my brother was Joseph, and my sister is Esther who is 
alive and is living i n Montreal. My parents were very educated peopl e and the y l ooked 

into it that the children should be going to the best school s. I attended a Lutheran school 

because there was no more Jewish school at the ti me that I grew up. However, we had 
been learning Jewish st udies in the afternoons. Also I had a private teacher who was 
teaching the German language. That was t he language that more advanced people, more 

intellectual people had been learning and m y father was originally from Bratislava 

Czechoslovakia and he wanted his children to be very cultured. And we were alwa ys 
going to the library, picking up books. My father would see what we are reading, he 
would discuss with us. I come from a very reli gious background but yet very open 

minded. We had lot s of celebrations. The holidays, Purim, everybody would come to the 

house. 
 
I: Everybody. Who? Relatives, friends– 

 

S: Friends. Friends and people who lived i n the town. The whole town had only fift y 

2 
 
Jewish families.  
 
I: And how many. How large was the town? 
 

S: The population of the town was less than 3000 people. And from t hat about 300 were 

Jewish people. Fifty famil ies, but you know, large families. Most ly t he Jewish people in 
the town, they were store keepers. A lot of the people, the y had bi g farms. There were 
doctors, 
somelawyers, but mainly reallyshopkeepers.
 
 

I: And your father was the rabbi in the town? 
 
S: My father was t he rabbi of the town and they really loved him. He had a special  school 

for big boys, which is what we call ed yeshiva. And I remember very clearly the beautiful 

times when they were baking the matzah near to the house, you know, singing and I used 
to love as a young kid t o walk around and all t hese lovely boys used t o pet me and I used 
to tell them leave me al one. So they named me ﬁleave me al oneﬂ in Hungarian.  

 We had a beautiful house. Lots of fruit trees. About fift y fruit trees. My momma 

used to cook all the fruits. You know it wasn™t  like toda y you go to the store and buy the 
canned goods, she would be putting into jars, making her own jams and prewn-
de
-qua(?), 
all these things, it was all a lot of fun. At the end of our house was a river named Sha yo. 
And we used to go to t he bank of the river. It had a lot of grass, and cousins would come 

from the bi g city of Budapest and we woul d gi ggle there. And we would be danci ng 
there, going swimming there. So we had a lovel y upbringing.  
 I remember t hat my mother used to bring a sewing lady and she would be sewing 

for us beautiful outfits for the holida ys. She was a very devoted mother to her children. I 

used to tell  ﬁmama you need also somethi ng newﬂ but first was her three children. She 
had a lot of pride, and t wo daughters. My sister™s name is Judit Esther and m y brother™s 
name was Joseph. And my brother was educat ed in the bi g city in Budapest. And we used 

to love when he came home and he told us beautiful stories about his experience i n the 
big city. I can thank him for who I am toda y because he was always t he one introducing 
me to a lot of things about science, and books. He would come home and he would 

encourage that ﬁwhat ever you have you can lose one da y but what  you have in your 

mind, that nobody can take awa yﬂ. So that was our life in the small t own. 
 We had been very friendl y with the gentile people. 
 

I: You went to a Lutheran school  

 

3 
 
S: I went to a Lutheran school. And we were very friendly with the minister. We were 
very friendly with t he doctor of the town. We were very friendly with our si mple 
neighbors too, who would love to come. And m y mother was call ed t he midwife of the 
town because when anybody gave birth t o a child m y mother was rushing and helping. 

Warming water for them, giving them some kind of food. 

 
I: So this was not just Jews, but also genti les 
 

S: Also gentiles, we were very friendly, we went to schools. A matter of fact I happened 

to be in m y childhood very good in arithmetic. And there was the daughter of the so 
call
ed ﬁmayorﬂ of the t own, she had difficulty and I used to go to her house, or she woul d 
come to our house. There was no separation between us except religiously. They went to 
their church and we went to our temple. But there was such a friendship. 

 Or we would go to the farmer to fetch our milk, because i n those days you didn™t 
have milk in the st ore. So we would go and we would sing with them while they were 
mil king the milk. Or they would come over to us and taste the cookies. My mother was 

an excellent baker. And we didn™t  feel that there was any kind of hostility between us and 

our gentile people i n the town unti l about 1942/43 when the y started to throw bad words 
towards us. 
 

I: Now before 1942 were you aware that there was anythi ng different going on? 

 
S: No. Nothing t hat was going on except a certain kind of restriction such as that the 
Jewish people coul d not anymore have beef because the y did not allow any more to kill 

cows according to the rituals of the Jewish faith. So that was the veryŠ 

 
I: So this was the Hungarian government that said you can no longer kill cows according 
to the Jewi sh faith. 

 
S: That™s right. That was the very first thi ng that I recall. And then later on when we 
started to feel that there is somethi ng goi ng on, us as children, we went on Shabbat 

Saturda y afternoon we went for a walk and we were singi ng some kind of Jewish song, 

and the first ti me that l ots of the town people started to scream ﬁdi rty Jew go to 
Palestineﬂ. At that t ime Israel was called Palestine. 
 

I: Were these people that you knew?  

 

4 
 
S: These were not people that we really knew. These were people, you can call them 
someti mes, hoodlums who were i n the street. So we didn™t pa y too much attention to that. 
Yet I have t o state it, that m y father had brothers and sisters living in Bratislava 
Czechoslovakia and he used to receive some letters from t hem. I as a young chil d, who 

had to be hardly ten years old at that ti me, I remember hearing m y father ﬁoh poor brother 

of mine, he has to be in a bunker.ﬂ Or ﬁpoor brother of mi ne, the y don™t know where he 
is.ﬂ 
 But I think being t he youngest of the family. Or ma ybe if I woul dn™t be the 

youngest, maybe they wanted to shield us chil dren and the y were not much talki ng about  

what was going on in t he world. I remember very vividly that m y father used to li sten to 
the secret radio. There were certain channels t hat brought  news from out of Hungary. 
And the y would come home and tell ﬁoh thank goodness the Americans are advancingﬂ 

or ﬁthe Brit ish are advancing, the y are hoping the y are goi ng to succeed to win t he war 

against Germany.ﬂ That I remember. But being a young kid, the y did not involve to much 
into the politics. But here and there I gathered that there must be something goi ng on and 
must be very important  that the German people should not be able to capture more and 

more countries.  

 I also remember, that is already in 1943, that a lot of people smuggled into 
Hungary Jewish people from Poland. Not in smal l towns, because in a small town they 
right away would  noti ce if somebody is foreign. But we had relatives. My mot her had 

two brothers and a sister in the city of Budapest and the y wrote that ﬁwe have some guest 

from a different country and the y are telling us terrifying storiesﬂ. But what exactly the y 
were telling, my momma and father woul d not tell us. So I assume, remembering these 
little episodes that m y parents were to a certai n degree aware of it. That there is 

something bad goi ng on in Poland and Czechoslovakia.  

 Also in 1942/43 a lot of girls came over from Czechoslovakia who escaped from 
bunkers where the y were hiding and could not  hide anymore certai n relatives who arrived 
to the big city. And that was the ot her sign that something was going on there. That the y 

had to run away from home and abandon even their own family  
 
I: Now you said that you would not be abl e to hid Jews i n a smal l town where you lived. 

If a Jew had suddenly shown up and started to live in your house what  would have 

happened?  
 
S: Well they, the local police would come, and the y would arrest them. Now when we are 

talking about hiding in a small town, now this is really a story for later on but this is 

related to this. In 1944 when the Germans marched into Hungary, m y parents approached 

5 
 
the catholic priest ﬁwould he hide the chil drenﬂ. So that i s also telling that m y parents 
were aware that somet hing bad was waiti ng for us. And at first the catholic priest was 
thinking of it, that he would hide us children, and then he said ﬁhow can I do that, the y 
would right awa y know that these are the chi ldren of the rabbi.ﬂ That™s number one. 

Number two, he sai d ﬁI have no wife, I have no children. How can I have children 

suddenly in my household.ﬂ But m y father told hi m ﬁafter all, you can have some 
studentsﬂ. But the end of the story is that he refused to hide us. 
 

I: So back i n 1942 if extra Jews had appeared would anybody had done anything about i t 

then?  
 
S: Yes. Yes, in ™42 already. 

 

I: But your family, as Jews were li ving as they had before? 
 
S: We had been livi ng as before. 

 

I: But if knew Jews would arrive something would happen? 
 
S: Something would happen, the police would arrive. The y would have to identify 

themselves, who are they. A matter of fact, in 1942, we had a cant or who was singing i n 

our temple, and since he had no Hungarian nat ionality.. In Hungary it 
takes much longer 
than in America. In 
America
 in five years you can become a citizen. He was not a citizen 
because it takes 25 years, I™m not sure what the laws are toda y, but in those da ys you had 

to live in Hungary25 years in order to get citizenship. And this fellow was from Poland. 

And he had no Hungarian citizenship. He had t o leave the country. And we were cryi ng 
that he is leaving the country and where is he going. He went to Palestine. And toda y he 
is alive wit h all his famil y and wit h grandchildren and so on and m y family is in ashes. 

So in a wa y it was luck if you were not a citizen and you had to leave, but that was the 
law. If you were not a Hungarian citizen you could not live in the country.  
 

I: If you were not Jewi sh you also could not li ve in the country? 
 
S: If you were not Jewi sh, also.  
 

I: So it wasn™t just Jews who had to.. 

 

6 
 
S: Well I don™t really know what happened wi th the people if you were just a temporary 
citizen you were allowed to live except if you were a Jew. If you were Jewish 
and you 
did not have a citizenship, that was the first thi ng that came out in 1942, that you had to 
leave the country. 

 

I: So that applied t o Jews only. 
 
S: To Jews, yes. Only. Yeah only t o Jews. 

 

I: So you were sayi ng that you were aware t hat something bad was happening. 
 
S: Yes I was sensi ng. I was sensing the tenseness. I was sensing that m y father was 

always secretly talki ng with momma. And when the y noti ced that t he children are coming 

they would change the subject. I was noticing that m y parents were shielding us more 
than before. If it was going to the streets, or traveling. They were much more alert  to 
what was going on than before. Until 1942/43, we were a fairly free happy life, traveling, 

go to the t heatre, going to the circus. Anywhere we wanted to go. Then later on, I am 

aware of it, I mean I remember it, the parents did not want the children too much to be i n 
the streets and not t o go to public places. We were not questioni ng why. But that™s you 
know, what I remember.  

 

I: And what do you remember next? 
 
S: The next thing that I remember, in 1943, September, my sister, my oldest sister. I was 

the youngest in the family. She went to st udy also in Budapest in a special school, and 

m y brother was awa y also in a special school. And I remember that the parents were ve
ry 
worried ﬁare the y ok?ﬂ. When before, the y were also awa y, except till this ti me t he y were 
not so concerned if everything is going ok wit h them. And in 1944, when the Germans 

marched into Hungary, m y parents wanted the children to come home. There was a 
restriction, the Jews could not travel anymore by train. We were very worried if ever my 
siblings would be able to come home. One morning m y father was stepping out from the 

congregation, the temple, and here is m y sister. ﬁHow did you get  home from Budapest
?ﬂ 

And she told us the story that m y aunt had dressed her to look li ke a gentile because the 
gentile people were a li ttle differentl y dressed. We were a little more fashionabl y dressed, 
the Jewish people. She should look more like a peasant. It™s really not right to sa y gentile, 

should say she should look more li ke a peasant girl. And she shouldn™t be too att ractive, 

she was a very beaut iful girl. 

7 
 
 And m y father was asking ﬁhow did you get homeﬂ? And she said ﬁlets go home 
quicklyﬂ. And she went  home and she told us the story that her relatives put her on the 
train and luckily it went smooth. When they saw her looki ng like a little peasant girl the y 
didn™t approach her. When she arrived, well  there was no train station in Onod. It was 

about seven kilometer from us a train stati on. And when she unboarded, when she came 

down from the trai n, she thought ﬁit™s night, what do I do? A young girl? How do I get 
home? I can™t walk t his in the night.ﬂ She remembered that  there is a Jewish family near 
by. She knocked on the door. Low and behold there was the headquarter of the German 

SS army. She™s opening the door and sa yi ng ﬁoh I™m so sorry, I don™t  want to di sturb you. 

I just wanted a little bit of water.ﬂ She quickly went out. Here she™s wandering and 
wandering and suddenly she remembered t here is another Jewish famil y living i n the 
town. She went there, and they tol d her ﬁ you sl eep overﬂ. The next morning the y brought  

her home. So that™s how my sister arrived. And later my brother arrived home too, also in 

a very s
pecial way. He got some papers from a gentile friend and he arrived too.  
 At that ti me we already knew that we were occupied by the Germans i n Hungary
. 
Yet Horti, who was the head of the Hungarian government  was refusing to let to do 

anyt hing t o the Jewish people. But it didn™t take too long. The Germans override hi m. 

The y fought against that. The new decree that  came out was that we had to have the 
yell ow star on our clot hing, that we are not all owed to be on the street, only at certain 
times of the day. The gentile peopl e are not allowed to sel l us any merchandise. We are 

not allowed to hire any non-Jewish people working for us. And slowly and surely later on 

came out that we have to make an inventory of whatever we have in our house and 
submit it t o the mayor of the town.  
 I remember t hat my mother was taking out  from t he closet a beautiful tablecloth. 

In those da ys, years before a girl was married they were embroidering and having the 

monograms on the tabl ecloths and on the bedsheets and the pillowcases. Each one that 
she was folding and writing down, her tears were running from her eye. And m y brother 
was helping her to make the invent ory.  

 
I: And you were watchi ng? 
 

S: And I was watching all this because I was a very curious little girl. I think that I did 

not grasp it in the dept h that this is not going t o be ours any more. I was just admiring to 
see 
the beaut iful colors and the beautiful embroidery and the counting. And m y brother 
was sa ying ﬁmomm y don™t worry, we come back I will buy you the most beautiful 

linensﬂ. That is ringing in my ear t o this da y. 

 

8 
 
I: He said when we come back 
 
S: When we come 
back. That ti me I understood that it means we have to leave our house 
and hopefully we woul d come back. I have to tell that m y father has been chosen to be 
the head of the ghett o, which one was locat ed not far from Mishkoltz. Called the place 

Diossjer. It  was a t own that the y had factories for iron. The y empti ed t he worker™s 
houses. That was very poor, like one room and kitchen kind of apart ments and t he y had 
to organize that place t o become the Jewish ghetto. At the ti me when we were doing this 

inventory m
y father was awa y because he had to go and organize this ghetto in Diossjer.  
 
I: Do you know how they chose your father to be the head of the ghetto? 
 

S: I have no idea why he was chosen to be because not only people from Onod but from 

all the surrounding towns. Except that he was the chief rabbi for all these towns. So 
ma ybe that™s the reason they had been choosi ng him to be the head of the ghetto. And we 
were expecti ng the father should come back from there after he is doi ng the job 

organizing t he place.  But he never came back from the ghetto. After a few days t he 

inventory was made. My mother succeeded to take a few precious pictures from the 
family and us children and a few tablecloth and a few silverware, such as which one she 
was lighting the Shabbat candles some Ki ddush cups, some silver cups, one of them I 

happen to have it here. To our neighbor, who was very devoted neighbor to us as well we 

were very devoted, good friends helpful for each other all the ti me. And she asked her 
ﬁdo me a favor Martha, put these things away. And we have to most probably leave the 
town. But when come back, you will give these back to me. And if I am not coming back, 

then please would you give these t o m y children.ﬂ 

 So all these little t hings indicate that m y mother and father, the y were informed 
somehow that elderly people are kil led or that elderly people the y don™t make it. The y 
had prayer and hope that the children will remain and she wanted us to have some 

mementos. Something that is from our household.  
 
I: At the time you did not realize what your parents did but looking back on what  the y 

said, you can see what they knew.  

 
S: At that ti me I couldn™t understand why mot her was hiding jams in the attic. Why was 
she putting awa y certain things or giving awa y some money to another gentile family in a 

small town who came to see if we had everything. I mean they, we call them ﬁchasidei 

omot ha™olamﬂ we call them the righteous gent iles who were worri ed and they 

9 
 
understood and endangered themselves, such as that family from a little town Hi dveg, 
coming in and bringing some potato knowing that we can™t any more buy food.  
 
I: and this was before you went to the ghetto 

 

S: Before we went to t he ghetto. Before we went to the ghetto. So that family, m y parent s 
used to have a collection of silver coins. You know toda y people are i nvesting in stock or 
putting in bank. In those days if you had a little mone y you put t hem in silver coins. The 

value didn™t  go down. For the chil dren, education later, or if a child has to get married. So 

m y father had a collecti on of silver mone y and he gave it to this gentile family.  
 Shortly after we had been submitt ing the i nventory, giving to our neighbor certain 
items to keep, it came an enouncement. In t hose days it was in the market place, the y 

used to announce i n a l oud speaker: ALL THE JEWISH FAMILIES. THEY HAVE TO 

PACK UP. THEY ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE ONLY CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 
CLOTHING WITH THEM. THEY HAVE TO GO INTO THE GHETTO. 
 Now we had to pa y wit h our own mone y, horseman, buggy, pack up and go. We 

had to leave the ke ys and all the inventory at t he house of the ma yor. We had to be at 9 in 

the morning, in 1944, end of May, I don™t exactly remember completel y t he date, but I do 
remember it was in May, we had t o go int o the ghetto in Diossjer.  
 

I: Now the ma yor was the father of your good friend, is that right? 

 
S: Yes 
 

I: Now what happened to your friendship with her? 

 
S: We were friendly until the last minute. However, at the ti me when t he yellow star 
came out, t hat we had to wear it on our clothing, our relationship was off. And the last 

thing that I remember him saying, the ma yor, was that ﬁI am sorry, I am not in a position 
of helping you.ﬂ In other words, he must have had some kind of emotions, and yet he was 
really, maybe in a posit ion where he was watched by the German occupying arm y. That 

he could not do anyt hing. Since he was the onl y one i mportant person in the town. So I 

am not able to blame hi m. It hurt at the time. But you have to put yourself in the shoe of 
the other person. And I have to stat e here that the Hungari an police depart ment, the 
Jundermaren, the y were worse than the Germ ans. The y were more brutal. 
The y were 

more beating us up. They were more hostile. In every wa y. 

 So we hire the buggy. We packed up my mot her took wi th her one chicken. You 

10
 
 
have to understand that  we lived in a town, and in the backyard my mother was growing 
chickens and ducks, and turke y, and somehow she was so senti mental with her little 
chickens that one chicken she wanted to take with her. So she took a basket, she took 
some straw, and she took one chicken with us to the ghet to. Some dishes, some l ittle 

leftover potatoes, some flower, whatever we had left in the house. And we each of us 

packed up some sui tcase with some clothing and here we went wit h t he buggy arriving to 
the ghetto.  
 

I: And did you take some favorite things t hat you wanted? 

 
S: Only our personal jewelry. But we were not  allowed to. We had to leave everything. 
Such as clothing, books. It had to be in the inventory. We had to write down how many 

books we had, or how many lamps we had. How many furniture with us. But we could 

not take wi th us.. 
 
I: You coul dn™t take a favorite book. 

 

S: No, we couldn™t take a favorite book. The only thing we took wit h us was really our 
personal jewelry and my father took with hi m, at the beginning he went, he took some 
books, to study. When we left the house we had to leave everything in the house, and the 

officers statement of the German was: you wil l come back, and that™s why we are doing 

the inventory, so you can clai m when you come back, what is missi ng from the house. It 
was known that behind all these decrees, and t he organization of the German Jews to go 
into the ghetto in 
Hungary was
 Eichman. Eichman was in Budapest, and he was the one 
who was organizing the departure of the Jewi sh people from Hungary
. Andthe inventory, 
and what you can take, and what you can™t take, this was all from the Eichman office. 
And the Jewish organization was hoping to have some kind of dialogue with him, some 
kind of agreement with him that if people are going to give you a certain amount of 

money, would you leave the Jewish people to sta y in the ghetto in Hungary. Or some of 
them even i n their homes.  
 We arrived to the ghett o and we were shocked to see how many Jewi sh people had 

been occupyi ng already. And the headquarters that was given to us was at one t i me a 

small room, with a tiny eenc y teenc y little kitchen, and yet I have t o say that ours was a 
luxurious apart ment compared to many ot her people who had to sleep together, t wo three 
families in one room. 

 

I: And do you thi nk thi s was ma ybe because your father was the head of the ghetto? 

11
 
 
 
S: Ma ybe. And ma ybe the y felt after all, ma ybe a rabbi is still somebody i mport ant. I 
really think that was the reason for it. My mot her placed the little basket with the chicken 
in the kitchen. This way she felt that there was some part  with her from her childhood. 

She was brought up, she was born in Onod, she was the the daughter, her father, my 

grandfather was the previous rabbi  before m y father became the rabbi there. So 
everything from that town, the river, the grass, the chicken, the fruit. Everything was a 
part of her life. So this piece, the chicken, reminder her. And the chicken is a very special  

story because usual ly chickens, the y la y eggs every other da y. Except toda y when the y 

are in incubators and the food is different. But in the primitive wa y of feeding them and 
raising them, chickens used to la y egg every other da y. While we were in the ghetto, that 
chicken laid an egg every single da y. And I remember that my mother would sa y ﬁthis 

egg is for m y youngest daughter because she is so skinnyﬂ. (Hahaa in t hose da ys). She 

should be eating, and I refused. So someti mes she made a scrambled egg and I divided it  
between all of us. Someti mes she collected at least two eggs and she baked a cake with 
the little left over flour that she brought with her. And then we celebrated shavuot, which 

one is the holiday of receiving the Torah from sinai, mountain Sinai. We celebrated. That 

was the last  holiday that I was with my parents together. And before that there went a 
whole discussion:  what  should we prepare for the holiday? We were used to have nice 
meal. My mother started to cry and she said ﬁshould we kill the chicken and I make a 

nice meal? or should we keep the chicken?ﬂ.  

 So the deci sion was that the y killed the chi cken because you don™t  know what will 
be really our fate. Apparently the y sensed, again, it™s an indication which at that ti me I 
didn™t understand, but l ooking back. And mother made from that one chicken, you name 

it, everythi ng. She made chicken soup, she made roast chicken, she made hamburger 

from the white part. And that was t he last chicken soup t hat m y mother made.  
 
I: And what was your religious life like in the ghetto? 

 
S: In the ghetto the reli gious life was that m y father had a special room where the people 
went to pray, andŠ 

 

I: This was for everyone in the ghetto? 
 
S: For everyone in the ghetto. But it didn™t take too long, and the Hungarian police came 

to the ghetto and the y came to pressure and question the people where did the y hide 

things. And where did you put cert ain things. You didn™t have everything in the 

12
 
 
inventory. We know that you had more sil verware, we know that you had some silver 
money, we know t hat you had a st ore. Where i s all the mone y that  you had been 
collecting al l these years? And many times they would very brutally beat up people, think 
that if they are really hi ding some things, seeing that the y are so tortured, the y wil l give 

in and the y will tel l. And the headquarters of the police depart ment  was behind our 

window. And m y mother used to hear the screaming of the people when the y were beaten 
up. And she just fainted, she just couldn™t take. She grew up wit h all these peopl e, from 
her childhood on. Seeing them, t hat the y are blue and that  the y are losing blood and the y 

are beaten up so severel y she just couldn™t take it. Either she was sitting and pra yi ng. Or 

she was cryi ng. And once I remember when she fainted. I do remember when that took 
place, when our doctor who was helping t he whole town. Giving birth to children, he was 
everything. A general doctor who helped heal children and birth children and what not. 

He was beaten up very severely. To that extent that m y father had t o i ntervene and had to 

get permission to t ake him to a hospital. Unfortunately he died from t he beating.  
 So that was the ti me my mother.. we used to li ve next door to the doctor. This was 
the height of what she could suffer, m y mother. After being in the ghetto about t hree 
weeks the new decree came out that we have to leave the ghetto. 

 
I: Going back to the room your father set up.. did that room remai n set aside for people to 
pra y the whole ti me that you were in the ghett o? 

 

S: The whole ti me that we were in t he ghett o. 
 
I: And were there servi ces held that people could come? 

 

S: Yes, yes. Three t imes in the da y and m y fat her conducted the prayer. 
 
I: Every da y, three ti mes a da y. 

 
S: Yes. As well my fat her was correspondi ng with the Jewish organi zation in the big city 
of Budapest who were in contact with Eichman, trying to ease the life of the people in the 

ghetto. Questioning them, what is our fate. What do we have to do? Do we have t o listen 

to all this? Or should we rebel? Should we organize something to escape, or just follow 
orders. And that I recall, that the order came i n from the Jewish organization in Budapest 
that ﬁEichman is promi sing that we will be taken to a working camp. And nothing is 
going to happen to any of us. And that we should be obe yi ng all their laws and al l their 

decrees because that™s t he only wa y that everyt hing will be smooth and everything will be 

13
 
 
good.ﬂ 
 
I: So you remember your father talking about t hat  
 

S: Yes, yes. That I already remember very well from the ghetto.  

 
I: And the services your father conducted in your room.. did the police ever try to 
interfere with that? 

 

S: No. 
 
I: Do you think the y knew about it? 

 

S: They knew about it and that was not their concern. Because, as far I remember the y 
said ﬁlet them do what they want t o do, it won™t last too l ong anywa y.ﬂ That was t heir 
approach. So they did not interfere with it. 

 From the ghetto, first of all they collected al l able working men. At that ti me, it 

was my father taken from the ghetto and my brother and all the people that I could call 
from age 16 till about 45, 50. All able working men has been collected and taken away 
from the ghetto. It was very sad kind of farewell from each other, departing. We did not 

no where they are taking them and what will be our fate. All women and children and 

babies, we are remaining and the old people. But the y said that t he y need some workers. 
So we hoped that it was true, that the y were needed for work. 
 

I: Did you sa y they took your father? 

 
S: Yes 
 

I: So he had been t he head of the ghetto, so he was no longer 
 
S: no longer head of ghetto, no longer organized things i n the ghetto, no more praying in 

the ghetto. The men were taken. Two days l ater, the y said that all t he people who 

remained in the ghetto, they have to march seven kilometers, which is approximately 
three miles in our measurements here. Into a brick factory in the city of Mishkoltz, and 
that from there, hopefull y in a short time we will go to C zechoslovaki a where they need 

working people. And we will be transported to that place, the working camp in 

Czechoslovakia in a short time. So we are walking, and at that ti me, not only Hungarian 

14
 
 
police men
 but also the SS soldiers were going with us, marching wit h us. And if you 
were going slow the y were beating you up and the y were hollering that you ﬁgo faster! 
we have no ti me!ﬂ and we arrive to the brick factory which consisted only from a roof. 
No walls. Nothing on the ground except some leftover bricks. And as we are arriving to 

that place we hear some men screaming to us. We thought that we hear the voice of m y 

father. But we couldn™t recognize him. Low and behold he was there. They sheared his 
beard, the y took off his hair completely. He did not have anymore his nice suite. He was 
in a pants and a shi rt. Then we got united. 

 We were in that brick factory, not doing nothing, except crying and starving for a 

few days.  
 
I: Did you have anyt hing to eat? 

 

S: Only some leftover bread that momma baked in the ghetto. Ma ybe a few potatoes. I 
remember that m y mother went out on the ground and she collected some woods and she 
had still with her one pot. She cooked some kind of a potato soup but it was more water 

than potato or anyt hing else. But at least it was warm. Really what  we ate, mainly it was 

stale bread t hat we had still with us. One da y the German soldiers came in and said that 
the y need some few hundred girls to work in t heir headquarters. To clean and 
to shine 
shoes. So my mother thought that here m y girl s are going to die from starvation, let them 

go to work, maybe they will be fed, ma ybe they can bring home some food for the rest of 

the family. We were taking with army truck. My mother gave a whole speech, be careful, 
you™re going with soldi ers. And the y said t he y™d bring us back in an afternoon. We went 
with the soldiers t wo ti mes. Two da ys. And our work was to clean di shes, to wash 

clothing, t o iron for them, to shine their shoes. The y threw us some bread and some 

cooked potato, whi ch was luxuri ous for us. And we brought home, we hide it in our 
pocket a few potatoes, a little bit bread, and we brought it back to the factory. The third 
day we were waiting and waiting that the y come to pick us up again because at least we 

were occupied, we were doing something. Plus to eat, we were given a little something to 
eat. They didn™t come, and instead of that, again, the y announced that  we have to march 
from the factory, which was very cl ose to t he railroad. We have to march to the rai lroad. 

We can take as many things we have still  left over, and we are now going to travel to the 

real good pl ace, we are going to travel to the factory in Czechoslovakia. To a camp, a 
working camping, not t o a factory but to a working camp.  
 So little we understood, or really we really knew what it meant to go to the 

railroad. Again the Germans with their huge dogs this time, they were the ones who were 

taking care of us, watching over us. Whoever who was collapsing, the dog woul d just tore 

15
 
 
it apart. We were walki ng, you know, rushing. Rushing to where? Rushing to the 
railroad. And we just couldn™t bel ieve in our eyes, what kind of train was waiting for us. 
It was the cattle train, without window. They pushed us in, 70 people into one cattle train. 
The y gave us two bottles, in one was water, and the other one instead of bathroom. Old 

people, screaming and crying, squeezed like sardines. The y closed the door. 

 Here we are in the cat tl e train. My mother and father was sitting next t o each 
other, and it  was ni ght t ime. And I heard my m other crying, and m y father said ﬁI wish 
that at least the chil dren should remain ali ve.ﬂ So again, I am sure they sensed it, the y 

knew it, the y had kind of information. They were fearful, their instinct, wh
atever. But 

they knew t hat this was not going to a good pl ace. You don™t take people in a.. 
 
I: And what about you? Do you remember what you were t hinking at the ti me? 

 

S: At the t i me I was just thinking where could I have some air. Where could I have 
something to drink? How could I calm the younger children that were crying? 
 

I: So you were thinking about the i mmediate present and not thinking about what was 

going to happen so much. 
 
S: No. I was not t hinki ng of.. For sure I was thinking of m y mother, because I saw that 

she is really not feeling good anymore. I was very close to m y mother. I used to pet her 

and calm her and say t o her ﬁGod is with us and it will be goodﬂ. And m y mother woul d 
say ﬁfor sure you will yet have yet a beautiful l ifeﬂ. And she woul d overcome her sadness 
just to reassure her children that everything will be ok.  

 When we got to the cit y of koshitze, which is a border city between Hungary and 

Czechoslovakia 
 
I: What was the name of it? 

 
S: Koshitze. They opened the wagon, the train, the cattle train. And they said that one 
person can go down and fetch some water and empty the bathroom bucket. So nobody 

was daring to do that. They thought that this is some kind of a trick. That the Germans are 

tryi ng to have some person to go down and they will kill that person. My brother 
volunteered. He went down, and he looked around and he saw that we are in a city. From 
the train station he could sense it or recognize it. He fetched the water. We asked ﬁaren™t 

we getting all off from the train?ﬂ 

 The German soldiers said ﬁno no no, we are not yet in the place where your 

16
 
 
working camp is, it™s taking a little bit longer.ﬂ Before they really cl osed the door they 
asked that, ﬁif you still have on you any jewelry please give it now, you will get  it back 
but because we are goi ng over a border it™s not good, it might get lostﬂ all kind of stories. 
The y took away the last jewelry that we still had. By the wa y I forgot  to tell that before 

we went awa y from the ghetto the y already took away all t he Jewel ry except each one of 

us was tryi ng to hide a memento. A ring. Or my mother, her wedding band. Or my father 
had a very special gold watch that he had in hi s pocket. The y came and the y screamed 
and said ﬁyou better gi ve it because otherwise we beat you to deathﬂ. So everybody got 

scared and t he last jewelry, the last possession that we had we gave it right awa y. The y 

closed the door and the train was going li ke mad, was rushing. Where is the train rushing 
so much? The noise was tremendous, and the cryi ng. People died. Old people in t he train. 
After three days, three and a half da ys actually, traveling i n a not normal  kind of 

situation. The bucket was full with what peopl e made. The smell, t he starvation, the 

crying the screaming, on and on. People were completely washed out. Some old people 
who died, they smelled. Suddenly they open the train. We are in Auschwitz. 
 When we arrived to Auschwitz, first the German soldiers with their dog the y came 

to the door. And they said that ﬁyou have to get off very fast from the train because you 

are going to start to work. Leave your belongings, that will be shipped to your camp, why 
should you carry it?ﬂ Then there were some st riped clothed men who were screami ng 
also that ﬁgo fast, you have to line up five in a row.ﬂ And in between screaming to us 

the y talked to us in Yiddish. A few words in the Jewish language, sa yi ng to us that ﬁdon™t 

go the mot hers with the babies. Gi ve the babies to the grandmothers.ﬂ And we thought 
they™re craz y. Why are the y saying this? Why should a mother gi ve up her child and give 
it to an old grandmother who hardly can walk anymore. We all looked pale, hungry, tired, 

the un-none(?). The mental facilities were not working properly anym ore, when you™ve 

starved for such a long time. When you suffer with the darkness. We didn™t want  to 
believe what they are saying to us. Or to do what they are telling. There were people 
though whose mi nd was ma ybe working better, who took the babies and gave it to the 

grandmother, which saved many people™s lives. But we didn™t want to depart from 
momma. The y said ﬁdon™t go families togetherﬂ. Then the y would hol ler in German. But 
in between, each ti me they would give us some little advice. Something that later on we 

understood how much they wanted to try and help us and t o save us. Then when t he y 

noticed that  the German soldier with the big dog is coming they woul d holler ﬁschnell 
schnell, los losﬂ. You have to go fast and li ne up the men separate from the women.  
 We lined up and we were 
standing mommain the middle, mysisterand meand 

then two other girl s from our home town. And the men in a separat e l ine. I remember m y 

father screaming m y name. He was very worri ed because I was the youngest.  

17
 
 
 
I: So you were then about 13? 
 
S: Yes, an d I was very very skinny girl. The y used to send me to resort place to gain a 

little bit of weight. When I was a child I just happened to be very slim. And m y father 

was screami ng m y name and I turned around and he said ﬁwhatever happens, wherever 
you go, you conti nue to believe in God.ﬂ And that™s the l ast words of m y father. That™s 
ringing each ti me in my ear. Apparently he knew that terrible things are coming and he 

wanted to reassure. That we should conti nue that the faith should give us strengt h.  

  
 
I: you were talking about the last words your father spoke to you at the entrance of 

Auschwitz  

 
S: Yes. Then we were walking and there was a huge tall beautiful man in arm y uniforms. 
He had white gloves on his hands. Shiny boots and a silver stick i n his hand. When our 

turn came to approach him he pointed m y mother to the left. Me and my sister and the 

two other sisters, Solomon, from my home town, to the right. When I noticed that my 
mother was pointed to t he left I grabbed her skirt and I wanted to pull her. My mother 
who spoke beautiful German, she said to hi m, ﬁplease mister, I am capable of working, I 

am a young woman, may I go to the other side?ﬂ  

 How she knew that left means not to go to good side, I can™t tell. Most probably 
she saw that more young people are put to the right. Or she just wanted to be wit h her 
children. But I remember her words, that she said ﬁI am capable of workingﬂ. And he 

became so angry that with his beautiful shiny boots he beat into m y m other and he throw 

her to the left. I still was holding her skirt  and tryi ng to pull, but he pushed her so hard. 
That was the last time I saw m y mother.  
 As I know, m y mother was gassed that very same da y in Auschwi tz.  

 We were taken to a big huge place where there were beauti cians, quote unquote, 
waiting for us. The y sheared our hair off completely. The y said that we have to take off 
our clothing, we are traveling for a long ti me, we have to have some shower. We should 

pile up nicely our cl othing. We were taken i nto a shower, when we came back, no more 

clothing was waiti ng. We were naked. We had to stand. German sol diers came t o count 
us, naked, without  hair. I remember screaming, ﬁEsther! Esther!ﬂ. That™s the name, 
Yehudit Esther m y sister. She said ﬁI™m standi ng next to you.ﬂ I coul dn™t recognize her 

without hair. Without clothing. And after the y counted us, then they t hrew us each one, 

some kind of an old shoe and an old dress. Then when we were about dressed we had to 

18
 
 
march, again five in a row, and there was a pai nting lady who had a red, can of red paint 
and she painted in t he back of our dress. I remember that I felt that the paint goes into m y 
body. Why are the y pai nting our dress? Well, in case we might in some miracle try to 
escape from Auschwitz we can™t because we will be noticed from far away that we are 
inmates from Auschwitz.  

 From the bathing house we were marched into Birkenau. Which was the camps for 
the women. That™s a sub-camp of Auschwi tz, Auschwitz Birkenau. We were given to go 
into a huge bunk. It was about the length of two, times three ti mes m y living room. 

Where we had been pushed in one thousand girls. No beds, no bl ankets. Nothing was in 

that room. They again called us to stand for ﬁseil aperﬂ which is roll call. I happened to 
want to make, and I asked the head of the camp where can I go, and she said ﬁin the back. 
But do it fast.ﬂ So until I find it, and until I made it and I came back and the y were 

already comi ng the Germans there again to count us, she became very angry and she gave 

me. She beat me up in m y face that I could not see for days. I got so swollen in my face, 
because she is blamed that there is missing one person from the counti ng.  
 Then I was standing in the row and the y count ed again and everything was ok. We 

were given food and the food consisted of black coffee and a little piece of bread, the size 

of half of my pal m. We ate and we asked ﬁwhere are we goi ng to sl eepﬂ. So the head of 
the bunk said to us, ﬁwhat do you think, you are in Budapest? What do you mean beds? 
You go and la y down on the bare floorﬂ. And she threw for every t wo girls a blanket. 

And she said ﬁthat is it, that™s for covering and whatever you want to do with it.ﬂ We 

were so exhausted from t he trip, from the separation, from the shearing our hair, from the 
starvation, that we all fell asleep with the blanket, two to one blanket. 
 The next day they t ook us to a different bunk and that bunk had some kind of 

preach beds. Like how you call, children have those kind of bed.. 

 
I: Bunk beds? 
 

S: Bunk beds, that™s right. So we were taken there and again counting, and this counting 
business went sometimes three four ti mes i n a day, sometimes we had to be standing 
outside early in the morning. And in Auschwitz even though it was June, when we 

arrived, the nights were very cold. Sometimes we were standing for four hours. Until t he 

Germans, they arrived and counted us. The dogs surrounding us. Jumping. If the y saw 
someone looked to them t oo pale or too skinny t he y would call out. At that time we did 
not understand where they are taking them. Each da y we were less and less. This was a 

camp that it™s called ﬁfirnektuslagerﬂ, which means ﬁeli mination campﬂ. Nobody was 

working, nobody was doing nothing. Every day, less and less people remained in the 

19
 
 
camp.  
 Opposite of our bunk was a so called ﬁhospit alﬂ and if somebody was sick and did 
go to that hospital, never returned back from there. My best friend from m y childhood, 
her name ﬁAniko weissﬂ, who came down wit h scarlet fever after a few da ys we were in 

Auschwitz. We tried to hide her. We tried to hold her. We tried to massage her. We tried 

to give up our little bit of warm stew that we were given j ust to make sure that she should 
not go to t he hospital. But nothi ng helped, one da y she collapsed from the high fever and 
she went over to the hospital. But  luckily there was one German nurse who had pity on 

her. She was a very beautiful 13 year old cheerful little girl, whose mother happened to 

be with us. And she tol d her ﬁyou are enough good, go back. Don™t st ay here in the 
hospital.ﬂ 
 We used to see trucks coming and they would pile on the trucks sick people. We 

used to ask where are they taking them? The answer used to be that t hey are taking them 

to the hospital. But they never came back. So we underst ood that it couldn™t be t he 
hospital. After we had been ma ybe, two three weeks in the concentrat ion camp, l ager B3 
Birkenau, t he y announced that all t hose children who are under the age of 16. From age, 

whatever, the y will remai n alive, they should be lining up, the y will be united with their 

parents, they will be given better food, they are going to have mil k and cake and bread. 
Who didn™t  want to be united wit h the parents? We did not know yet, that nobody from 
our parents is any more alive, or if even alive, we will not  be unit ed with them. We lined 

up, happily. We are going to a better place. 

 
I: Now was Esther under sixteen al so? 
 

S: Yes, Esther is t wo years older than I am. So we lined up. The two other sisters, the 

Solomon sisters, 
who were members of m y father™s congregation. They said, ﬁoh you are 
going awa y, we wil l remain hereﬂ because t hey were older. One of them was already 
married and the other one was 22, 23 years old. And they said ﬁoh we will miss you so 

muchwhy are you go
ing?ﬂ But we said ﬁbut we will be united wit h the family and we are 
going to be served bett er foodﬂ so we lined up. 
 Here we are lining up, five again in a row, they again counting us. Around us all 

the ti me SS soldiers wi th their huge big dogs that we god forbidden we can™t move now 

any more from the row. As we are standing, and the y are counting, I hear a voice sa ying 
ﬁgo back, don™t go wit h this group.ﬂ And I was looking who is talking to me? I believe 
that the German lady soldier, she would be saying this t o me? Why i s she sa ying this t o 

me? Now until thi s da y I don™t know if she was the one who was talki ng, or it was an 

inner voice, instinct or the soul of my mother. The end of the story is that I grabbed m y 

20
 
 
sister and she was very annoyed ﬁwhy, we should be going, we will have goodﬂ. And 
when I heard this voice three ti mes sa ying to me ﬁjust get out from thisﬂ. I took her, and 
the German soldier, the lady, with her dog, did not interfere, she let  us go out from the 
row and we walked back to our bunk. The whole group was taken, not  to be united with 

the parents in this world but to the gas chamber.  

 Many ti mes, until this day, I feel guilty. Why I have been t he one who was told if 
it was by the German soldier or by the soul of m y mother or by an angel, or whatever. 
Why the ot her girls had to go to their death. But that™s fait, and perhaps god had a special 

reason to save us from that ti me from the death. So a lot of miracle things happened in 

Auschwitz
. 
 
 After a while we were t aken over in the same camp to a different headquarters and 

one night, I would never forget that, we heard tremendous screaming. There were no 

windows. Only through the cracks of the wooden bunk we could be looking out. And we 

saw a lot of fires and a lot of smoke going. All the gypsies who had been also taken to 
Auschwitz have been gassed that night. And t he gypsies were very di fferent in that 
mat ter. The Jewish people, when t he y were taken to the gas chambers the y were singing, 
ﬁshema yisraelﬂ they were saying t heir pra yer. The gypsy people have no religion. The y 

very pri mitive people. The y were tryi ng to fight. The y were trying to take their nails and 
attack the soldiers. It was such a night that  it™s still ringing in my ear the screaming of the 
gypsy people who were gassed that night. And the fire that we saw was their bodies that 

were burned to ashes. That was the very first time that we really saw with our own eyes, 

that there is a gas chamber and that there is fire. And from that day on we knew, that if 
you are taken from t his camp you are taken to the gas chamber and you are being burned. 
So we were very much aware what i s going on in Auschwitz.  

 In about end of August , beginning of September, because t he dates are not so 

clear, you know. Except that through some miraculous wa y,  we were aware when is our 
holida y coming. There was alwa ys one girl , if we were marching, t hey used to take us t o 
the bath, to the collective bath, we would march near to the men™s camp. The y would 

alwa ys used to scream names ﬁmaybe there is one relative, did you see this, did you see 
that?ﬂ They would also scream to us ﬁdid you know tomorrow is Shabbat?ﬂ Or ﬁdid you 
know that tomorrow is the new year?ﬂ  

 One day we were marching, and one of m y uncle was screaming and asking if we 

saw his wife Olga. So we knew that he is still alive. The mens were mai nly in Auschwitz 
and the y had been a litt le bit worki ng. But what their work was exact ly i t™s hard for me to 
know.  

 In about the beginning of September the y call ed again that they need some 

workers for a factory. But the ent ire camp has to line up in a very empty field and the y 

21
 
 
are going to choose some people for work. I had no choice because t his ti me not age not 
group, not one part of the camp but the enti re camp had to be naked, stand, and the 
German soldiers, and t he head of them, Dr. Mengele that we called the Angel of Death, 
he came. He started to count and after he was counting the entire camp, that was a few 

thousand girls. He started to point  to the right again and to the left.  

 
I: How did you know t hat it was Dr. Mengele? 
 

S: We know it because when we arrived, the striped soldiers, the striped inmates, the y 

told us that there is a doctor whose name i s Dr Mengele. And then later on the head of the 
camp, who happened to be a Jewish girl, who was worki ng for the Germans, she used to 
throw this ﬁoh wait till you meet t his Dr. Mengeleﬂ. So we knew t hat was Dr. Joseph 

Mengele. He came and he started to point people, but thi s ti me t he left meant that you 

remain still  in Auschwi tz and the right is t he group that is going to leave the camp and is 
going to be taken to some kind of a factory to work. They said soldiers are very busy on 
the front, the y are fighting the war, and there are no more able people working in the 

factories.  

 So my sister has been chosen to go to work, and I to remai n in the camp. Well I 
didn™t want  to get separated from m y sister and somehow I felt that if I were to remain 
here I woul d not be able to endure anymore. B eing together gave strength. Each one was 

strengtheni ng the other. We were each of us gi ving faith and strength to continue. So 

what should I do? I started to crawl on m y stomach towards the group that has been 
chosen. One of the SS soldiers noticed me and beat with his bayonet  on m y back which 
one there is still a mark of it. And he said in German  ﬁuver fruchte yuden so vi vosh 

tardﬂ. ﬁYou devil jew, you will anyway die. Go where you want to go.ﬂ I crawled i nto the 

group and again they st arted to count and count. Somehow I was very lucky that even 
though they had counted again and again there has to be only three hundred in the group, 
how it happened it was three hundred with me together. Now if somebody left because 

her sister was.. I can™t t ell you. At that ti me they took us to a trai n and we left Auschwitz .  
 The y planned to take us to a factory but the allies were by that ti me bombing. 
American
 and Briti sh soldiers were already heavily fighting. And I remember that the 
train was going back and forth and back and forth. The y couldn™t  reall y go adv
ance 

because each time when the bombing was they would ship the t rain backwards to 
Auschwitz. So we didn™t know, is this a new method of killing us? Because in the train 
we again didn™t have ai r, didn™t have food. And we thought that we are going to die and 

no one will ever know what happened to us because we are in the trai n. However after 

three four da ys of being shifting back and forth we arrived to a camp called Bergen-

22
 
 
Belsen. And when we arrived to Bergen-Belsen that was exactly a day before our most 
holy day of the year, Yom Kippur. Yom Kippur is the atonement of the Jewish people, 
and we made a decision that we are going to fast.  
 

I: You and Esther 
deci ded
 
 
S: That™s right, and a few other friends who were with us i n the camp. And the German 
people there in Bergen-Belsen, the y didn™t  do really nothi ng with us. No working, not so 

much roll calls. But in Bergen-Bel sen the other problem existed t hat a lot of people came 

down with typhoid fever. Dysentery. The food was a tiny bit even better than in 
Auschwitz. The da y we requested t hat we want  to fast, would the y give us two portions. 
The y said, what are you craz y? Where you t hi nk you are back in Hungary? However, we 

fasted. We were in Bergen-Belsen sleeping on the bare floor. Little bi t of straw somehow 

we collected, and I rem ember that I came down with infection of m y gums. My whole 
face was swollen from it. Yet I did not dare go to the infirmary because by that t i me we 
had enough knowledge that if you go to t he infirmary that™s the end of you.  

 

I: Back to Yom Kippur, so you and Esther and some friends fasted, and did you observe 
in any other way the fast? 
 

S: No we couldn™t. Except there were a few prayers that we remembered. Some older 

girls who remembered some little part of the prayer. We would be singing toget her, or 
sayi ng together. On Yom Kippur. And we remained in Bergen-Bel sen for a couple 
weeks. And then at last  we were taken to another camp called Rochlitz where there was 

really a factory, and it amazes me until thi s day that not only that they t ook us to work, 

but the y were teaching us certain technical measurements. We were schooled. They were 
hoping, the Germans, that the war would t ake such a long time, or that they will be 
enslaving us for such a duration of time, or just this is the way of the Germans to educate 

all the ti me, it was amazing. Every evening we were taken t o a school for two weeks and 
we were learning speci al kinds of measurements of little airplane appliances. The factory 
where we were working was doing all ki nd of little tools and gadgets for airplanes.  

 In that factory we worked three shifts. Each ti me eight hours. Sometimes in the 

night, someti mes i n the da y, somet i mes in the evening. And the foreman, who happened 
to be a German fellow, was having such a pitty on me, and I am until t his day very 
thankful for him that he used to cal l me in into his office, and close t he door, and give me 

a little bit of his fareena. He was always eat ing cooked fareena in t he morning. So I 

alwa ys looked forward to the shift when I worked in the morning because that da y I new 

23
 
 
that I am going to have something in my stomach.   
 One day while I was in his office, eating the farina, the German soldiers who came 
once in a while to observe if we are working, if we are producing, if we are doing our job 
comes. And she sees me inside. He quickly grabbed the pl ate and t hrew it down. He 

started to scream at me ﬁso tomorrow you know better how to measure the appliance that 

you have to do!!?ﬂ I understood that that was a cover up. He hi mself could be in trouble 
favoring or doing anyt hing for me.  
 While we were in that camp, it came our holi day Hanukah. The holiday of lighting 

the menorah. We want ed so much to light because we were so broken by then. 

Spiritually, mentally,emotionally,physically. We thought
 that maybe that would cheer 
us up. That would give us some kind of a hope. Thinking how the war between the 

Greeks and the Jewish people took place many years ago. Maybe that light would bring 

in some ki nd of warmt h. But where do we have, where do we have a menorah? Where do 

we have oil? What can we do? 
 There were girls who were worki ng in the kitchen, that was cooking for us that 
little bit of food. And one of the girls said, ﬁyou know girls let™s not t alk about it. I™m 

going to bring home some kind of potato. We will cut the potato and carve it and make 

from it a menora. Low and behold, every evening she put one potato until she had four 
potatoes, cut it in half, scooped it out. I don™t know how we did it but we did it. And now 
is the problem where we have to get some kind of an oil to light the menorah. So the 

other girl who was working, she said ﬁjust don™t talk about it, I™m goi ng to find 

somethingﬂ. She found an old bottle, she filled it in a little bit of oil that was used for 
cooking. So now we have potato and oil but we don™t have the wicks. What are we going 
to do? So we tore from our one dress that we had. We had no underwear. We tore and we 

made wicks. And we put it in the oil. Dipped i t. We had no matches. There was one 

soldier who every evening used to come and go by the lit tle houses and the ti me we were 
put up four to a litt le house. This was a camp that was taken away, a working for a 
summer camp or some sort of thing. It had small tiny litt le houses and four girl to each 

tiny little house. And t he soldier used to come to see if it was qui et if everybody i s doing 
what the y are supposed to do. I went out and I said to the soldier ﬁyou know what? I need 
desperately j ust one match if you would give me.ﬂ 

 He sa ys ﬁfor what?ﬂ I said ﬁwell don™t ask too many quest ions, could you give me 

one match and he threw his match. We lit  the Hanukah candle the next evening. And we 
were all crying. And the whole camp came t o that one house and the y said ﬁhow did you 
get this? how did you make it?ﬂ And we rem embered one Hanukah song and we were 

singing the song and that gave us strength. We are human, we are celebrating a holiday. 

We are not completely oppressed.  

24
 
 
 And the soldiers who came to check this evening was a different one. Wel l he was 
hi mself, a few came started to knock on the door. ﬁWhat are you doing? Where do you 
think you are? You are inmates. This is an N. O. No you can™t have Hanukah candleﬂ. 
The y didn™t  sa y Hanukah candle, the y said you can™t have fire in your house. Out. Out. 

 And we had to kneel on our knees for four hours as punishment that we dared. But 

we were all smiling to each other. Never mind this kneeling. What we did, we showed t o 
the Germans that we are still human beings. And what they are aiming, to completely 
destroy us, our emotions, our spirit, the y did not succeed.  

 Many ti mes when I am asked ﬁwhy didn™t you revolt?ﬂ Our main revolt was 

showing t hat we are human. Physically we couldn™t. We were surrounded with barbed 
wires with electric wires. We could never escape. But we alwa ys t ried to remain human. 
To help each other. To try to celebrate here and there a certain holi day. This wa y 

revolted, we showed to them that as much you try to destroy us, you can™t completely 

destroy our spirit.  
 
I: so your religion reall y helped you to keep going?  

 

S: A lot, a lot.  
 
[break] 

 

I: You were talking about how i mportant religion was for helping you survive 
 
S: well all the ti me that  we had been in the camp, religion gave us a lot of strength. And 

the devotion to keep rel igion, and the devotion to each other, the helpfulness of one to 

another gave strengt h. And wherever we coul d observe any of the customs or holida ys, I 
think that spiritual ly, mentally, emotionally, gave us uplift and strengt h.  I remember 
there was in Bergen Belsen a girl who was with us remains in Jerusalem, who would 

collect in an old broken can some rain water in order that she coul d wash her hand to that 
little rationed tiny bit of bread and bless over i t so she can thank god for sustaini ng her 
life and giving food. I remember celebrating in Auschwitz the da y that we call tisha be™av 

and we are remembering the destruction of the holy temple in Jerusalem. We fasted. And 

being able t o do all these things gave us a lot of emotional strength as well spiri tual 
strength. I would say that most of the people who had faith, who had religion, who tried 
to say certain pra yers t hat the y remembered or here and there smuggled in people a 

pra yer book. And we were at least once in a week sa ying some ki nd of a prayer, they 

were the ones who coul d take the suffering. And the y were the ones who were able to 

25
 
 
overcome a l ot of the hardship. I would sa y that people who had no faith, and mainly 
people who came from very spoiled backgrounds, very well to do people who never 
knew any kind of hardship, the y were the first one. At least from m y experience, the ones 
who came from mi schkoltz, who came from Onod, if i look and I see who remained from 

the holocaust. Definitel y from m y hometown all the girls who came from very well to do 

families, not one of them came back. Even t hough that I come from a middle class family 
and I had a maid. My mother alwa ys made sure that we have some kind of job such as 
making beds, washing t he dishes, and we al ways used to ask her, why not morishka our 

made? Why do we have to do? And mother said you never know when you will need it. 

 And I am very thankful for her, having this foresight. If it was for Auschwitz or 
for my life later on, I think it was very beneficial and very special. I thank for m y parents 
that they rai sed me t o have faith in god and whenever anything very bad happened I knew 

always to whom t o turn. It was my god. 

 Now I am going to go back to m y camp where I had been working and where we 
celebrated Hanukah. In the middle of January, one da y we were just roaming around in 
the camp. The group that was in the factory was in the factory. The girls who were 

working in the kitchen. And the group that was off, we were just roami ng, trying to 

breath a littl e fresh air. Suddenly from far away we see a column of men marchi ng. And 
the y were very very t ired, very weak, some of them in striped clothing. The y were 
screaming, the ﬁwar is over.ﬂ We thought t he y were crazy. How coul d the war be over if 

we are still in a camp and the y are marching? But they probably had some kind of 

knowledge that the allies are advancing.  
 The y passed by, we didn™t know nothing what their fait was. We conti nued to 
work. However, about two three weeks later, we were tol d we have t o empty this camp 

and we are to be taken to a new concentrati on camp. We were taken t o a new 

concentratio n camp cal led graslitz.  
 Graslitz was a jailhouse. We were put up, it was emptied or it was an old jailhouse 
I do not know. But we were 1800 girls. We were put up in a jail house. They had bunk 

beds. We were given very meager food there. Only twice in a day. The German soldiers 
kept on sa yi ng ﬁwe don™t have any more food either so we can™t provi de for youﬂ. Every 
morning the y would march us a few kilometers awa y from the jail house under the 

supervision, the guard of the SS soldiers to a huge mountain. We had to chainline from 

the top of the mountain to the bott om of the mountain. On the top of the mountain was a 
huge pile of stones. We had to take those stones down. B ut how? One was throwi ng it to 
the other person. And i f you dropped it, you were beaten up. 
And we thoughtat leastwe 

are instrumental, we are going to help to build something, that™s why we are taking the 

stones down. But the next da y came our surprise, we had to pile t he stones and take up 

26
 
 
from the bottom to the top of the mountai n. And this went on for a couple of weeks. It 
was just to destroy us. Cause even if you are enslaved and you work and you see that 
something is growing from it something t his built from it , you have a certain kind of 
meaning, satisfaction, you feel that you are instrumental. But just to work, to make fun of 

us, to belit tle us, t o make a mockery of us was very bad for our morale. And some of the 

girls said ﬁi wish i  collapse already, who want s to live anymore? there is no end to this. 
we are not going to make it, we have no family anymore.ﬂ  
 We have been in that camp and doing this work about mi ddle of march, end of 

march. One da y the SS group of soldiers comes in and the y said stand up next to your 

bed, we have to have a serious talk. We thought that the y are going t o shoot us. Why 
don™t the y take us t o work anymore. They sai d ﬁwell we have to t ell you you have a 
choice. either you stay in this jail house, but we leaving the buildi ng, and we don™t 

provide you with any food or guarding you. What will happen to you will happen to you. 

Or you line up five in a column and you march with us. We have to leave this place.ﬂ 
 We didn™t understand why they had to leave the place. Why the y are offering for 
us that we can stay. No one of us dared to remain. Because who is going to provide us 

food? They may lock t he door, we won™t ever be allowed to go out. The windows had 

iron bars. The door had iron bars. If they cl ose us we will suffocate us. So everybody 
marched out, one thousand eight hundred girls and the y were marching with us, which is 
called the death march. For six weeks. Marching every si ngle day. Someti mes 40 

kilometers, someti mes 35 kilomet ers. And we were someti mes sleepi ng outside on the 

bare ground, someti mes I remember this was sude deuitchland this was the cold still in 
March and i n April fairl y heavy. Someti mes on the top of the snow we went to sleep. We 
were licking the snow because we were not gi ven any kind of drink. No food. We were 

collecting some of the grass. 

 Once in a while the y would take us to a bi g barn where we were gi ven some straw. 
The ani mal s on one side and we on the other. And I don™t have to describe to you what 
smells we had there. And we went  to sleep. We collapsed, hungry, wet, someti mes from 

rain or snow. Without food. In the morning many times I wanted t o get up when t he y 
called us to get up and I couldn™t move. Peopl e laying on me. I woul d call ﬁplease would 
you get up, would you move, we have to li ne upﬂ. The y don™t move, the y are dead. Each 

day, less and less of us remained. My sister, who was two years older than I am. She just 

asked me ﬁplease leave me here, I don™t want t o go anymore.ﬂ Her leg was all swollen, 
she lost her shoe. She had swollen legs, she had pus in her leg. She couldn™t move any 
more. I used to grab her. I the young one t he skinny one. But very det ermined. My 

personality I am very active, until this day. I used to put her on m y shoulder and a little 

bit carry her and I woul d sa y to her ﬁI can™t carry you more but you have to go because 

27
 
 
we will go back, and we will tell the story and we will remain in life, and god is with usﬂ, 
and again going and going and going. Thi s went on every single da y. If we were lucky, 
once in a while they would be able to ask the farmer if they have some leftover potato 
that they cook for the pigs. And we woul d be jumping on it. That  would be a feast for us. 

Many ti mes we were given flour and we woul d just lick the flour. Once I remember we 

were going, marchi ng and by the roads in Germany, in sude deut chland there are ditch 
next to the road and we would find some rotten apple we would pick up and we would be 
just eating. Someti mes if the Germans, the y noticed that you went off from the road even 

for one single minute t o grasp an apple, the y would shoot the person. If some person 

could walk any more, couldn™t march, the y would be shooting the people.  
 One evening we arri ved to a farm and before we were even given t he opportunity 
to go to sleep in the barn, one of the German soldiers and the rest somehow, they were 

not there. One of the soldiers, a very handsome young fellow, he start s to talk to us. 

Before they wouldn™t t alk to us we were li ke dogs in their eyes, even the dogs the y were 
talking bett er than to us. But this time he comes over and he sa ys ﬁI have to tell you a big 
secret. I am actually Jew. My mother was a Jewish person, m y father was a German. And 

I enlisted to the SS in order that I can help you.ﬂ 

 We were shocked, you know, ﬁ you helped us? you used t o beat us up? you used t o 
shoot the girls who were standing who could not move any more and now you are telling 
us.. what is the reason you are telling us that you want so much for us to find favor in our 

eyes.ﬂ But we could not think anymore clearly. He said ﬁbut I am going to get for you 

tonight also food. And I am good, right I am good to you
?ﬂ
 
 So we were not responding to it. We just wait ed if he really is going to give us 
food. At that moment the only thi ng that we wanted was to drink something to eat 

something and to be able to go to sleep a bit. So low and behold he brought us again 

some 
kind of cooked potato that was half rotten, was cooked always. Those days that™s 
what the y fed usually t he pigs. We ate and we went to sleep. 
 The next da y we were marching and in the morning we l eft that barn and we went 

by a bridge. And we looked, how beautiful that water and how lovely it would be to go 
down and j ust wash our face. We are full wit h lice, our clothing i s full with lice, we are 
dirty we haven™t been drinking, we haven™t  been washing ourselves for weeks already. 

Could we go down? No, the German soldiers are surrounding us wit h their huge dogs and 

they are keeping us, telling us go fast, we have to march, we have t o get to a place. We 
are marching, and then towards the evening we see that we are back i n that very same 
place. And this went on a few days, that they surrounded us in t hat very small spot maybe 

two three li ttle towns but each ti me we are back to the same spot. So we started to think it 

must be something goi ng on that the y can™t take us further awa y. But  still we di dn™t 

28
 
 
believe that the end of the war is coming. That time I think we were al ready left ma ybe 
four hundred girls. The rest collapsed either di ed during t he night in the barns or were 
shot by the Germans.  
 

I: Esther was still with you? 

 
S: Esther was all t he ti me, and the two sisters. That what I think gave a lot of strength to 
each other. That we remained all t he time from da y one t o the end of the war together. As 

we are walking, each one of us feels that any minute we are going to collapse. And what 

will happen to us if we collapse, we will be shot or we wi ll expire anywa y from no food 
no strength nothing. One of the Solomon sisters, the older one, Mindy, she said ﬁI am 
going to sit down in the ditch. If the y kill me t hey kill me. I have been married already, I 

tasted life already. But if they don™t shoot, then you all come and join me later.ﬂ So she 

sits down in the ditch, and no German soldier is coming back or shooting or counting or 
seeing who is here. And we don™t see the German soldiers. The y went ahead of the 
column. So we went back and we sat down wit h her. And we™re sitting all four of us in 

the ditch next to the road. We hear some shooting and we got very scared. We thought, 

oh, this is a trick they just let us to sit but the y will return back and they are going to kill 
us. So we look around, where can we go? Who will take us? There are no houses. 
Opposite of the road we see a little forest. We say lets go into the forest and hide there. 

We go over the road. We go into the forest. We are hiding in the forest. 

 This is late afternoon, Ma y 7th 1945. We are sitting there and we are starved. 
What will happen t o us if we are not going to have any food. That wi ll be our end. But 
the first thing, we l ook around in t he forest. Maybe we find somet hing, grass an apple, 

garbage. Nothing we find. We shake out our blanket, which was full with lice and lets si t 

down. Because if we are going to walk around we are wasting what little strengt h we 
have. We sitting down and we hear some ki nd of little noise. So we see a little creek. We 
went, we drank from that water. We washed our face. We started to say a little pra yer that 

we remembered by heart. We sat down and we started to cry. What wi ll be our fait? What 
will happen to us? As we are sitting, and we are quiet holding each ot her hand, suddenly 
we hear a rooster and t he mooing of a cow. So my sister said ﬁli sten girls, we must be 

close to a farmer. If we hear so vividly, so clearly a rooster we must be close to a house. I 

am going t o go there.ﬂ 
 Suddenly she™s strong, suddenly she™s willing, suddenly she™s abl e, suddenly she 
wants to do. ﬁI™m going to beg for foodﬂ. So we said ﬁare you crazy? they™re German, 

they™re also going t o shoot you.ﬂ She said ﬁI am not going to tel l. I am going to tell them 

that I amﬂ we spoke very well German ﬁI am going to tell that I am a refugee, m y house 

29
 
 
has been bombed, m y parents died, I happen t o be outside, I remain in life, I have 
nobody, I am an orphan, would you give me some food?ﬂ 
 So one of the Sol omon sisters said ﬁI won™t let  you go alone. I wi ll go with you. 
But how will we find back the wa y to the forest?ﬂ So like in the story of Hansel and 

Gretel we tore from our dress, tied to a few bushes and we were in the beginning of the 

forest even, not goi ng in deep, you know? And the y were going according to the noise of 
the cow. And thank god that it was not far reall y, it was at the edge of the forest, a little 
farm. And they went and they begged and they got some mashed potato and in a little jar 

a little bit of milk. They came back, we had a feast. We sat  down and we ate and t hen we 

made a decision that we can™t sleep all in one time because just in case we hear that the 
German™s coming back we have to go more deep ma ybe we have t o hide whatever, two 
each ti me was sleepi ng, two each ti me was sitt ing and waiting. We rotated. It was early in 

the morning, about 4:30, 5:00 in t he morning. It was still dark outside. Suddenly we hear 

a tremendous noise bet ween the trees. We hel d each one the hand and set out our little 
pra yer ﬁjust god please help usﬂ And suddenly we thought this is our end, maybe a beast 
ma ybe a lion, who knows what is in the depth of the forest. And he smelled human being. 

And he™s coming and if we were not killed by t he Germans we will  be killed by a beast. 

But low and behol d, suddenly a huge tall soldi er is standi ng in the front of us who 
screams to us in Jewish language and sa ys ﬁchi ldren don™t be scared, I am your brother, 
you are liberatedﬂ. It was Ma y 8th in the morning. The R ussians capt ured that part of 

Germany and the y knew that there was a group of inmates who were marching and the y 

were looking for girls where they are. And he was searchi ng in the gutters and i n the 
roads and i n the forests and in the woods wherever to get. He sa ys ﬁget up don™t stay 
here, you go into the town, it™s very close by. And any house that you want, you go in 

and you sa y that the Russian occupying arm y said to put you upﬂ.  

 We had no strength to walk. We walked a littl e bit, the second house we saw we 
opened the gate and a priest comes out and greets us ﬁhell o who are you?ﬂ We told hi m 
we are inmat es and t hat  we are going to be here by you because that™s what the R ussian 

arm y told us. He said ok, and he points to the barn that we should be going there. 
We 
didn™t want  to go i nto t he barn so we went into the yard and we sat down in the grass. 

The woman who was his cook, she brought out again mashed potato and this time warm 

mil k and we eat and we very happy and we sitting in the fresh air. 

  
I: What was the name of the village? 
 

S: The village was Jatetz. We are sit ting outsi de very happy. Later on we went to sleep in 

the barn. It was a clean barn, it had ha y. It didn™t smell, because apparently he di dn™t have 

30
 
 
any more cow there. We slept. In t he morning we getting up and we sit outside. We 
wanted just  to be i n fresh air. She brought  us some bread with a lit tle bit of butter on it, 
and again some kind of milk. If I recall, I think she made us some cooked farina. About 9, 
10 oclock i n the morni ng. The same Russian soldier who came in to the forest comes to 

check on us. ﬁSo gi rls how are you doing?ﬂ We said fine. ﬁHow was your sleep.ﬂ Ok. 

ﬁWhere did you sleep?ﬂ So we show hi m the barn. He rushed int o the house and he said 
to the priest ﬁexcuse me you have such a huge house, and you put these girls who went 
through a whole year of troubles, and you™re putting them in a barn to sleep? how about 

you sleep i n the barn and these girls insi de?ﬂ 

 So he gave us a room. He slept also in there, another room. He real ly had a big 
house. From that da y on he became a different person. He realized t hat this is what his 
mission is now t o help the refugees to come to certain kind of health and strength. He 

gave us beds, she gave us beautiful kinds of pillow and cover and feather in those da ys 

the pillows were. I just couldn™t sleep in the bed. So I had to go down on the floor and 
sleep cause I just was not used anymore after a whole year. It was t oo soft, I just couldn™t 
find m yself. For a few days until I got used to it, first the pillow and slowly I got  back 

and I slept i n the bed.  

 About three days later unfortunately m y sister came down with a very high fever 
and the two other sisters. All three had to be put in leibeshitza, a nearby city. And they 
had to be put up in a hospital, the y all came down with typhoid fever. And I started to 

gain weight  and my hair started to grow and I started to l ook human. These priest was 

very kind, every da y he wanted to learn wit h me. He was learning with me Hebrew. He 
said ﬁhow about you become my daughter, you become catholic. I will provide you with 
everythingﬂ. I told him I really appreciate everyt hing but I am the daughter of a rabbi and 

I promised m y parents that whatever will happen I will remain faithful to m y own faith. 

From that da y on he never bothered me, he was very kind to me. Then there were 
Czechoslovakian soldiers in the town who had a special headquart er and you could go to 
their headquarter if you were a refugee, if you were an inmate from a camp and the y 

would give you a little bit of clothing. The y would direct you a lit tle bit. I told them only 
one thing t hat I am requesting is if I coul d get a bic ycle so I can go in to the other city 
where m y sister and my friends are in the hospital so I can go and visit them. Low and 

behold the y gave me, how the y got for me a bi cycl e I really don™t know. The y gave me a 

bicycle, they gave me a scarf that until this da y I think I never got such a scarf in m y life. 
I started to put around my head, around m y neck. The humanity started to come back. 
The woman in me. To look decent, to look human. The lady who was the cook of the 

priest, she would bake with me cookie that  I should take to the hospit al. I was at first 

shaking, how can I ride the bike? I haven™t been riding the bike for over a year. 

31
 
 
 But god was good to me and I started first around in the yard, and then I went and 
I was on the road on the bike going every da y to visit the sick. Until one da y I felt this is 
quite dangerous on the road. There were stil l Russian arm y coming i n and they were not 
the nicest. Except this one fellow who liberat ed us, the rest were not  so nice. There™s a lot 

what to talk about. I just felt very bad, also m y sister was very very sick. Her mind wasn™t 

anymore there. So I begged the head doctor if he could gi ve me some job in the hospital 
so I can be near to m y sister. I told hi m otherwise she will die.  
 

I: you were talking about asking for a job in the hospital where your sister was 

 
S: so the doctor looked at me and he said ﬁwhat do you think, you look skele
ton, you 
want to have a job?ﬂ I explained to the doctor the need that I have t o be near to m y sister. 

He told me that it™s ok I can be in t he hospital, I can be in a– he said to me ﬁI understand 

the need for you to be near to your sister and I tell you, t here is a littl e porch that is 
enclosed. I am going to provide there a little bed. You be there, you don™t have to work 
here, unless if you want to cheer up the sick people here. I see that you have some special 

ability in you, and that you are a very cheerful t ype of a personﬂ. I sai d ﬁ yes indeed I 

should be cheerful, do you know what I went through and look, I am here and I am 
normalﬂ. So they made me a little room and that was very near to the bed of m y sister. 
She was unconscious and yet I used to rub her feet. And I used to talk to her, and slowly 

and surely she came back to her self. The other two girls also got bett er. I used to go to 

the other sick peopl e and sing for them songs that I remembered from my childhood. My 
sister got better. 
 When she was released from that hospital the y told us we are not allowed to leave. 

Going back, we wanted to go back to Hungary, we wanted to see maybe somebody 

remained from the famil y. We hoped for m y brother, who was the oldest, he was 17 years 
old. We thought that maybe he came back. Maybe our father because he went from 
Auschwitz to M
au
t hausen. We didn™t know that he perished later on. Ma ybe someone is 
alive, but they said that  we can™t travel, she™s much too weak for such a trip. How the y 
organized it I really don™t know, but we were given a room and a kitchen and every few 
days we had to go back to the hospital to check up with m y sist er. At that ti me I came 

down also with some kind of, I had stapyl ococcus infection, all over , all kind of things 

on m y body. The Russian doctor came, and wi thout any anesthesi a wi thout anyt hing she 
came and cut , I have marks. Painful, but at least I got healed. About end of august, we got 
the permission to l eave Germany and go to Hungary. The Czechoslovakian organization, 

the arm y, gave us some mone y to purchase tickets with t he train and we went to Prague 
first. The capital of 
Czech
. There the joint, the 
American
 Jewish organization had already 

32
 
 
a headquarter. The y had already a list of names of people who perished, not correct yet 
com
pletely but the y had plenty. Unfortunately that was the place where we find that 
neither one of our parents, and not our brother remained from the war. We were very 

torn, didn™t want t o stay t here. Ma ybe some cousin, some uncle, somebody remai ned. 

Let™s go back to Hungary. We took the trai n from Prague, we went back to Budapest. 

Low and behold we found that we had two uncles who remained, one of them was in the 
Swedish house of rockelenberg who gave them papers. Two of them were in the Jewish 
ghetto. In a miracul ous wa y they remained with their whole family. But they didn™t have 

place for us because after the war, everybody was living together. There was shortage of 

apartments. Or maybe shortage of good will t oo. I don™t want to go i nto it, it™s a painful 
kind of thing.  
 We were put into an orphanage home. Our education began right away. It™s 

amazing how peopl e survived and were right away active and organized schooling for 

children. We both went to school. Although my sister had to be in a 
sa
natorium for a 
couple more months but once she was released from there, you see the t yphoid fever was 

so strong t hat once it at tacked her lungs and she had to recuperate full y from the sickness. 

We both had been i n school. In 1946 at the beginning of the year, they were talking about 

that all the orphan children shoul d go to Israel  because the memori es are much too heavy 
to be in Hungary. We can™t return t o our hometown, we have no parents. Ma ybe if we are 
in a new environment, maybe if we are in a new country we will be easier to forget, 

psychologically it would be easier to transit ion from the terrible experience that we went 

through. I didn™t want so much to go yet because I wanted at least t hat one school  year to 
end. I felt that it was deprived so much from my education. However t hey said that even 
though I di dn™t finish t he year, since I was doi ng very good, the y are going to give me 

credit for that year.  

 In 1946 about Ma y, we went with an illegal boat to Israel. Which was occupied at 
that ti me by the British. Even though the Britains knew what we went  through, they were 
not much fond to admit us to Israel . We were a lot of orphans and a lot of broken people 

and we went on the deck of the boat and the British boat came to great us. They wanted 
to send 
us to 
Cyprus. We begged t hem that please we are so broken, we need to get out 
from here. We need t o be in the country. After a whole long discussion they admitted us 
to Israel. We were put in a camp again for three weeks. But then some teachers from the 

Jewish agency came and released first the young children, and I arrived in 1946 in June 
to Jerusalem. I was put up in an orphanage home and I went to school.  
 Most of my educat ion i s really from Israel. I have m y B.A. from the Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem and I became a certified teacher over there. Then I conti nued 

there in higher universi ty i n Allentown.  

33
 
 
 
I: How did you get to t he states? 
 
S: To the states I came as an exchange teacher. To New York, to Brookl yn Flatbush, to 

yeshiva of Flatbush. The principle visited, I was teaching al ready, I was newly married 

and I was teaching i n Israel when he visited me in the class. And he asked me if I would 
want to come for a little bit and teach here. I had m y only sister, Esther, was married and 
she lived in America. I thought to m yself, for sure I want to go, this is m y only family I 

have and for two years is not so terrible. The t wo years last for thirty eight years and I am 

very happy to be in this country. 
 So now I would li ke to tell, I have first been in the ghetto in resjur, then I was in 
the brick factory in mishkoltz, we were taken t o Auschwitz, I was in t he Birkenau lager, 

and the camp was nam ed B3 which one was meant a camp of elimination. Every da y the y 

eliminated it was called the fernichtemslager, it was death camp. From t here, luckily it 
was the end of September I was taken to 
Bergen
 Belsen. In December from Bergen 
Belsen to rochlitz where we worked in a munition factory. We made l ittle appliances for 
airplanes, from rochlitz we were taken to graslitz. Graslitz we were in a jailhouse and our 

work consi sted of piling stones from the t op of the mount ain down and up and down. 
Then for six weeks the death march and liberat ed in nearby to leibeshi tze jatetz, 
leibeshitze t hat™s sude deutchland, by the Russi
an
 army. Living by a catholic priest for a 
while. Then in the hospital, then in a little apartment in the city of jatetz and from there 

we returned to Hungary. I can thank to m y parents that I was able to hold out in the depth 
of the darkness and the most difficult days due to their upbringing and due to the special 
supervision of god, who even at a t ime that there is darkness in the world he wanted 

people to remain, perhaps to tell t he story of what took place. I am very happy, I have a 

nice family, god was very good to me, I have four lovel y children and thirteen beautiful 
grandchildren who know what I went through and the y are really trying in each day and 
in each moment to sweeten my life. 

 
I: and you married a rabbi? 
 

S: and I married a rabbi who happened to be m y teacher in Israel. And we got married in 

Israel and had two chil dren there and two i n t his country. 
 
I: Your name when you were born was Naomi. Now you use a different name? 

 

S: My name was.. well you see in t hose da ys Jewish people gave a Jewish name and the y 

34
 
 
had to give also a name that was accepted by t he country t hat you lived. My Jewish name 
was Sheindi which means pretty and m y Hungarian name was Naomi, spelled in 
Hungarian N
-A-O- M-I. Naomi. When I arrived to Israel t he peopl e thought that I was not 
Jewish. I was blonde, very fair faced. The y asked me what is your name. So I said to 
them Naomi because in my papers it said t he official name. The y said ﬁoh this is not a 

Jewish girlﬂ. And I sai d ﬁwhat do you mean, I have a Jewi sh name, m y name is Sheindlﬂ. 
ﬁOh shendl ! that means ‚pretty™, why should you have that name? That name in Hebrew 
is Yaffa. Yaffa means pretty. In Yiddish, sheindl means pretty.ﬂ So t hey said ﬁ from now 

on your name is Yaffaﬂ. From then on in all my papers is both of m y names ‚Yaffa 

Naomi™. The only name I do not carry any more was given to me in the Jewish l angauge 
ﬁsheindlﬂ, by my parents, which was translated into Hebrew. That™s why the difference of 
the name. 

 

I: I also f orgot to ask your father™s name 
 
S: My father™s name was Phillip Donat. 

 

I: And your mother™s name. 
 
S: And my mother™s name was Olga Donat , who was born Schick. My grandfather, rabbi 

Schick was a very great rabbi who establi shed a very speci al kind of a school. One of it™s 

kind in Hungary. Where they not only learned bible but t he y learned.. It was like a 
vocational school, they learned also some kind of trade. Either being a tailor or being a 
shoemaker or carpent er. My grandfather bel ieved that a person should have some kind of 

a trade. Not depend on it that somewhere he is going to have an i ncome. I am very proud 

of him, that™s how I thi nk we should be in life, combining the two. It™s one thing not 
enough. You have t o have both. My brother™s name was Joseph Donat, whose perished in 
the holocaust. My sister, Esther Yehudit, she™s alive and she lives in Montreal. That™s my 

name now, is munk. I am married t o a rabbi Yona Munk.  
 
I: Your story is very important, thank you so much for giving your t estimony 

 

S: 
thank you for your ti me 
 
[new interview session] 

 

I: Mrs. Munk when we had the interview several months ago we l eft off about the ti me 

35
 
 
that you and your sister Esther went to Prague for a day and then t o B udapest. Can we 
pick up there and then you tell what happened when you arrived i n Budapest? 
 
S: First I want to go back to a minute to Prague. The main reason t hat we went back to 

Prague (A) it was on the wa y but mainly because that was a center for information, who 

the people survived. There were charters already put up i n the Jewish center and t he 
temple there and we looked if our father and brother survi ved. Somehow we knew that 
mother perished at t he very beginning there in Auschwitz. However we didn™t find their 

names and we still had slight hope. We di dn™t want to spend any more time in Prague. 

We took the very first opportunity of train and we went to Budapest. As we arri ved to 
Budapest by the train st ation was big trucks waiting for the survivors, which was 
organized by the joi nt. Joint is an organization from 
America
, Jewi sh Organization 
helping refugees. I real l y don™t know the details of the name, but it™s a well known 

organization. It™s in exi stence until  this da y. They help out in the diaspora in many m
any 
other countries people who are in need of help. The y greeted us, t he y took us to a 
headquarters that they established in a school for the refugees that came back and had no 

family. As we were goi ng through the streets of Budapest, suddenly I noticed th
at  we 

were passing by the house where m y aunt lived and I started to scream t his is ‚hunadeter™, 
this is the street where my aunt li ves. However the y did not let anybody to get off 
because the y were not sure that anybody survived in that address, if that aunt is really 

alive. So we continued and we went to that  place that was established for the refugees 

and after a day somebody from that orphanage home visited the place, her name i s Esther 
Eckshtein who today is still alive and lives in Israel in the city of Bnei Brak. She was the 
head of that orphanage home and she made every effort to collect as many Jewi sh girls 

who remained after the holocaust and try to bring them to the orphanage home that she 

established in 
Budapest immediately after the l iberation. To try to reeducate again those 
people who lost over a year, some of us more of schooling. So t he orphanage home was 

located in Budapest  and she took us, not only me and m y sister, but a lot of girls who 

arrived in the transport back to Budapest and we were put  up in t he orphanage home 
where we had regular schooling during the day. How she organized this, from where she 
got the mone y and the energy, herself a survivor, who was for many years first hiding in 

Budapest, then caught and sent to a concentrat ion camp in Theresi enstadt. Upon her 

return, that was her ai m and dream that as many children that survi ved she wants to see 
them being educated again. 
 In that orphanage home we had very meager, but we had some food. We had very 

si mple headquarters for sleeping and resting. We had excel lent teachers. In Budapest 

many of the professors and teachers from the gymnasium remained ali ve thanks to 

36
 
 
Wallenberg or some of them just i n the ghetto who were hiding or with false papers. 
The y also felt that t his much what the y could do to educate the generation who remained 
alive. So we were st udyingŠ 
 

I: How did that feel to you to be in that situati on? 

 
S: In that situation, in a wa y I was missing the home at mosphere.  Having m y home. Also 
I have to tell you, two uncles and one aunt  remained alive in Budapest. I had been 

visiting them once in a while. We had free ti me we could go visit ing museums or books 

in the library. Each ti me that we had that ki nd of period I would j ump over and go to visit 
m y aunt. It was very traumatic to see that t he y lived in their own home, they had t heir 
own furniture, it was a family life. Here we had no family life whatsoever.  

 

I: Did you wish that your aunt would invi te you to live with her? 
 
S: Not really. Because not being in the camps, she had not enough understand what we 

went through. In a way I cherished that I am together wit h people that had the very same 

fait that we had.  We had more understanding of our moods, our crying, our not  being 
able to cope someti mes with the regular daily situation. Because we were together. We 
had all together that very same background that very same kind of fait and we helped 

each other to overcome.  

 
I: What were the moods and the crying and the difficult y coping l ike? 
 

S: well it was very difficult, we had no mommy with whom we could discuss. In a simple 

way our menstruati on our monthly period did not return yet back because of our 
starvation and the medi cation that we got in Germany. It would be lovely to talk over it 
the mommy and to hear from a mother, don™t worry event ually it will  happen. Or 

momm y would say lets go to a doctor. We had to deal wit h all little and big problems by 
our self . Even though we had teachers and the mother of the orphanage home. But it™s not 
the same wi th talki ng to your own mother. 

 

I: So you were able to t alk to these people but it was not as helpful as talking to your own 
mother. 
 

S: It was not as easy. Maybe helpful it was because the y did seek out doctors to take us 

and have checkups but it wasn™t the same l ike talking wit h your own mother. You are shy 

37
 
 
more and there are cert ain things that you were just keeping to yourself and you wouldn™t 
want to share because even they were trying and very warm, nevert hel ess it wasn™t the 
same. So we were missing family very much so. In the light that Budapest 
family life 
more or less returned to normalc y, because the ones who remained, remained int act. To 

see was a contrast to the life that we maintained in an orphanage home. But really I have 

to praise that there were three teachers beside this Esther Eckshtein, whose name today is 
Esther Weinberg. There were two other teachers, who she really recruited them, very 
knowledgeable girls and the y all are still al ive. One of them in Brooklyn New York and 
the other is in Israel.  

 
I: Do you have contact with them? 
 

S: I do have contact wi th them. In fact this past summer I was in Israel and Esther, who 

was the head teacher and the head of this whole organization of the orphanage home and 
seeking, looking after us. She put together an evening in honor of m y visiting Israel. It 
was very moving because some, very few who remained still from that school that 

orphanage, came to greet me. I am in very strong contact with Est her. However t he other 

teacher, Rachel, was al so there. The third one, Miriam Gross, she is less involved with 
the group. If it has to do with it t hat she moved awa y from the circle of the girls. The 
maj ority of the student s from that orphanage home are living in Israel. But I visit often 

Israel so I am in touch with the teachers. Each ti me very i nteresting remi nder of the era 

that we all went through together after the war. 
 
I: Is it partly upsett ing t o you to visit agai n with them? 

 

S: Really not. In fact as the years pass by I am more and more admiring their mission 
their undertaking and all the effort and attention they gave us. For inst ance I remember 
that Esther went to a sewing lady and ordered for all of us beautiful blouse and beautiful 

skirt in honor of one celebration. To give back to us a feeling of humanity. To feel good 
about our self and to look good! Which was very i mportant we had no clothing. We came 
back from the concentration camp, a matter of fact m y wi nter coat was a German soldiers 

arm y coat that I shortened and somebody helped me to change the buttons that I shoul d 

feel a little bit better. Here was a woman, you have to understand that at the time the 
situation in Budapest was very difficult. I™m talking about ti me t hat it was still under 
regi me of the Russian arm y. People were st anding for bread in the street. Clothing was a 

rarity. So we didn™t feel that outcast with out poor clothing, and yet she was drivi ng and 

doing everyt hing t o get  for us some dresses some blouses some skirt t hat we should be 

38
 
 
looking more decent.  
 
I: Aside from standing in line, were you aware of any abuses from the Russian soldiers? 
Personal abuses? 

 

S: I personally not , but on the train traveling here and there I used t o see them seeking out 
nice looking girls. Just stopping when the train stopped, stopping these girls of continuing 
their trip. Grabbing them and taking them down. Whatever they di d with them, t hat coul d 

be understood.  

 
I: Were you frightened to travel by yourself on the train? 
 

S: Very much so and I rarely traveled if at all. The only trip that I took once was with my 

aunt to Onod. I don™t know if I told you this that m y mother before we left, she hid some 
of the family pictures and some si lverware by a gentile lady. My aunt  wanted very much 
that we should have some mement os from our parents. So we traveled together and my 

aunt was putting a babushka on me. I should not look decent, I shoul d look very 

frightened, very skinny which I was anywa y, and very pale. But she was protecting me. I 
don™t think that ever I would travel by m yself, at all in those days. 
 

I: When you had ti me off by the orphanage di d you walk by yourself to your aunts. 

 
S: We walked, but never alone. Never alone. We would never wal k alone. Never in the 
evening. It was mai nly in the da yti me. Luckily it wasn™t too far from my aunt. If I visited 

m y aunt I would alwa ys watch my watch t hat if it™s starting in winter already to be dark, 

we would be heading t o go back to the orphanage home.  
 
I: So you were very cautious. 

 
S: Very cautious, yes. 
 

I: And when you went back to Onod with your aunt to see if you could find the mementos 

what happened? 
 
S: When we went back to Onod t o find the mementos we came in and she was a neighbor 

of us and she greeted us very friendly. When my aunt sai d ‚menomka(?)™ you know m y 

sister who you loved and loved you, she left with you a few very i mportant items, would 

39
 
 
you be able to give it back? This is a child that survived.ﬂ My si ster was in a sanatorium 
so she coul dn™t travel with us, she wasn™t wel l yet. She said, ﬁwell I am very sorry. I 
know she gave us a lot of things. I was very happy to do t hat for her but the Russian 
arm y 
passed by here and t hey came into the houses and emptied everything and they took.ﬂ 

 Somehow, looking around it didn™t seem that the house was robbed by t he Russian 

arm y or that anythi ng was emptied from t here. So m y aunt told her ﬁwe™re very thirsty, 
would you go out and fetch some water?ﬂ Because there were no faucets inside i n those 
days yet. We™re talking about 1945. She went out to pump some water from the well. 

While she was gone, my aunt went and opened up her drawer, low and behold there it 

was. When she came back she was white. She said ﬁoh gee I really didn™t know that the 
things remained.ﬂ 
 

I: So your aunt showed her that she found the things in the drawer. 

 
S: Yes, yes. She found the things and she said ﬁoh I am so happy t hat you did find it.ﬂ If 
it was really true that she didn™t know, that it wasn™t emptied, all the drawers, or it wasn™t 

all. At any rate we got back. That™s how I have some pict ures of my fami ly. 

 
I: How did that feel? 
 

S: It was very very moving. Very moving moment to see my parents again even if the y 

were not alive. But I thought to myself, no cemet ery, no anything to remind of m y 
parents and here I am looking and seeing m y beautiful father and mother and my brother. 
It was a great moment. Each time I am taking out the pict ure I feel like I am close to 

them.  

 
I: How did it feel that t he woman was deprivi ng you of ..(?) 
 

S: Well at t hat moment I felt a little angry at her. I felt if she couldn™t keep the silverware, 
but pictures? If she wanted to have the silverware because she needed mone y, t hat™s one 
thing. But at least the pictures. That  somehow I couldn™t grasp it. Why would the Russian 

arm y take pictures? I do know that the y took usually wat ches or jewelry that the y were 

looking for. But the pictures I couldn™t underst and. But I think that she felt that if she™s 
looking in the drawer for the pictures then other things will come up, I really can™t figure 
out exactly, I don™t want to accuse. I felt at that moment that the whole world changed, 

apparently. That people who have been very friendly and very hel pful. Once the y used t o 

come and shovel our snow because the snow was so high that we coul dn™t open our door. 

40
 
 
We would go and help them in any kind of situation especially m y m other who was the 
midwife of the town, so anywhere that the child was born she was there. It didn™t matter 
if Jewish or not Jewish. Poor or rich. She woul d go and help. Warm water, bathe the 
baby. Cook a meal for t he mother after the chil dbirth. Here we are comi ng back and the y 

are so cold, so to say. 

 
I: This was the woman that your mother had selected, someone she could trust. 
 

S: Yeah. So it™s hard to know. It puzzles me somet imes, but having the nature that I don™t 

want to hate people or be angry at people. Perhaps she really want ed to keep those things. 
It™s possible, you never know. 
 From there we went  back to Budapest and I remained in t he orphanage home 

almost a whole year. From September 1945 until Ma y 46.  

 
I: Now Est her 
was ina sanatorium allthat ti me
 
 

S: 
Most of the ti me. After January 1946 she was let out from the sanatorium, she got the 

ok from the doctors that she recuperated and she joined us in that  orphanage home. So I 
do have some pictures of celebration, that we are together already i n the orphanag
e h ome.
 
 
I: Now where were the Solomon sisters that you were with? 

 
S: The Solomon sisters, they went back to Onod. The y did find their little home. They 
were somehow not afraid of living in the hometown. One of them who was marri ed found 

her husband. He came back. So was a man protecting them. You know it was a very 

different kind of a situation. The y lived together the husband and the wife and the sister. 
Eventually after a very short time being in Onod the y moved to a bigger city called 
Mishkoltz, which is the nearest city to Onod. There were many Jewi sh  people who either 

came back and found someone of the family or they establ ished again a family life. Some 
people got married a couple months after the holocaust. The y were at the age of marriage 
and the y wanted to have some kind of a famil y life. A home life. So in Mishkoltz there 

was already a fairl y dynamic Jewi sh life again. The y established school, the y had a 

temple, the y had a visit ing rabbi. I never participated in any of the acti vities there because 
I was in Budapest, but even until t oda y there are a few families who are in Mishkoltz who 
happened to be from Onod and survivors. They still have a templ e. I don™t think they 

have any 
Jewish schools now anymore.  

 

41
 
 
I: In a previ ous interview you talked some about your faith, but what was your religious 
life like now in Budapest? 
 
S: In Budapest the orphanage home was an orthodox religious home. We had been 

conducting the same type of life that I was brought up at home. Pra ying, blessing over t he 

bread, rest according to the code of the religion. It was more or less t he very same one. It 
is really amazing because a lot of people who survived the y like, so to say, turned awa y 
from God. Asthe head of yeshiva university,
 Dr. Lam, once I had a very interesting 

discussion with hi m, and he said to me ﬁ you know Yaffa, I am not  surprised the ones who 

turned awa y after the holocaust. To me it i s most surprising the ones who remained 
faithful such as you.ﬂ Many of them who real ly completely turned away eventually 
recovered from the traumatic experi ence and slowly came back to the  realization t hat 

even though this terribl e thing happened, still t here is God. It coul d be that for some kind 

of a reason he turned away. Or he let things to happen in the worl d. But definitely there is 
a God. Unfortunately a lot of people just can™t cope with it. They have so much anger and 
so much disappoi ntment in God t hat the y can™t return back again. I feel very lucky and 

very fortunate that it di d not effect me and I remai ned the same faithful person that my 

parents brought me up. I pity the ones that can™t recognize the hand of God because I 
think that i t gives me a certain strength. In m y whole life, if it has to do with copi ng wit h 
what I went through or the daily life toda y. To see the creati on and not  to believe t hat it 

was created by God. To see a beaut iful day li ke toda y, the sun i s shi ning, the renewal of 

nature. How all thi s is t aking place, yes science has to do with it, but definitely above all 
is God. I pity the ones who can™t see and recognize his presence. 
 

I: How do you explain to yourself all the terrible things t hat happened? 

 
S: You™re asking me a very difficult question because I am all the t ime trying t o answer 
to myself this tremendous puzzling question. Why it took place. Why I had to l ose m y 

parents. Why 6 millionJewsand so many gentilesandso many gypsieswhowere 
innocent. Mainly t he most hurting and pai nful for me is whenever I think of the 1.5 
mil lion children who were completely innocent. Even if we want t o blame or put any 

kind of pressure on people, or to sa y it came to them because they did something, but 

what did children do, they are innocent. So that is most puzzling. The only wa y that I can, 
is that it™s above my human understanding. Because there i s no explanation for it. The 
greatest nation, the most cultured, the most educated peopl e were t he Germans. The 

people of science, the people of so many good things, music, you name it, the y really 

knew. That the y could go down to such a level and to be so cruel and so systematically 

42
 
 
and in so organized a way, to kil l out so many people it™s be yond my human 
understandi ng. I feel that is for me the best  answer. There are things t hat we know, we 
have a great sage, his name was Rambam. One of our great scholars i n Judaism who said 
that ﬁ you are allowed t o search the wa ys of God, but when there is no answer that means 

that it™s above a human ability to understand.ﬂ I can cope with that answer. I don™t buy 

any kind of answer that they were mad, that they killed the Jews because the Jews were 
rich or all kind of other explanation. They t ook away their jobs.. There is no justification 
whatsoever to kill so many million people in such a cruel wa y except this is one of the 

things that  we don™t understand. 

 
I: So your very strong faith continued throughout  
 

S: I think so, that that helped me all  the time. Wherever I have been I always felt the 

presence of God. All the miracles that happened to me during the holocaust and after. I 
feel that he was watching over me. We all survivors have that ki nd of question, why me 
and not others? It™s not  alwa ys the easiest thing to live with that kind but you have to 

believe that there is a special reason. Why some of us and so few of us remained after the 

holocaust, perhaps to tell the story, to teach people to be careful. When you are angry you 
have to cal m down. It™s a lesson. If it™s not  tak en as a lesson for humanity, to be careful 
and to know how to conduct yourself in daily life too, with your neighbors with your 

friends, with your fami l y, then the holocaust was in vain. If we learn from it if we better 

our way our wa y of life and the whole of humanity is learning from it than at least  it 
wasn™t completely i n vain. Otherwise, why so many peopl e?  
 

I: So that™s part of what we™re doing toda y.  

 
S: Yeah. 
 

I: So you were in the orphanage unt il about  May ™46?  
 
S: Until about end of April. It was very int eresting, teaching a little bi t, even though I was 

fourteen years old, but what I learned I was teaching to younger children. In the 

orphanage home. 
 
I: What subject were you teaching? 

 

S: All kind of subjects, mai nly math. From chil dhood on I was a very good student in 

43
 
 
mat h. I remember in my hometown the mayor™s daughter who had di fficult y in math, I 
used to teach her pri vat el y. I must had been maybe 10 years old. It  just so happened that 
was my best subject. So I was teaching to the younger group and then one eveni ng they 
gathered us in our soci al hall and t he y said that there is an organized group that is going 

to Palestine, who would like to join? They told us that it™s a difficult journey, it™s not 

legal, the British people don™t want Jewish people to come to Palesti ne but we are going 
to organize and you wil l be put int o schools and orphanage home. It was somet hing that 
appealed very much to us. You have to understand that wherever we t urned it reminded 

us the host ility and the abandonment and t he cruelty of people. How did the y let  all this 

to happen? Why di dn™t the y try to hide us? Why didn™t they try to go against the German 
regi me? Why didn™t they t ry to fight for us? So we were not happy to be in Europe. We 
wanted to get awa y from t here. It reminded us too much. Wherever we turned. I 

remember going in the street and suddenly crying, why? because I remembered that the 

last ti me that I was in Budapest was when my father and mother took me to the big zoo. 
In a wa y we were happy because we had clothing, we had food, we had good friends, we 

had been in school. But everything reminded us of the tragedy that  had happened to our 

nation. We arranged just to leave. So when this announcement came t hat we can go to 

Palestine, we were very happy. 
 The y organized and prepared us that it won™t be an easy journe y. We will have to 
go through borders, through Hungary to Romania in the night, have to hide, they are 

going to try to get the boat from C ostanzo, that ™s the port city of Romania. From there to 

go to 
Israel. Wejoined it.
 
 
I: Who was organizi ng this group? 

 

S: It was a zionist group organizing this group, based in Budapest. 
 
I: The y wanted to help children get to Palestine. 

 
S: That™s right. The y knew that emotionally, i t would be the best for the children. To be 
away from all the environment that reminds them constant ly of what t ook place. To go to 

a new count ry where most of the year is spring, that alone, being more free. 

 
I: The group was going to be all children.  
 

S: The group was mainly children or young people. The el derly peopl e, the y were sick. 

Very few remained except in Budapest. No elderly people came back from the 

44
 
 
concentration camp. They organized this t rip. I remember bringing very few items with 
us. We didn™t have too much anyway, but because we had to be in a truck. They put some 
benches in a truck, closed the truck with blankets. During the night we went through the 
border. I real ly don™t know how t he y arranged this with the Romanian government that 

they closed their eyes that these refugees are going through the border. We were stranded 

then in Bucharest, which is the capi tal of Romania, for about six weeks. Also in a Jewi sh 
organized home. Again, just girls together, and our teachers were wi th us. We continue 
even on the truck, we were continuing learning. The y were very much into that  that the 

kids shoul d not suffer any lack of education. That all what had been deprived from us 

during the year or some were longer in the  camp, should be given back to them, to 
educate again, in a way to be also busy wi th knowledge i nstead of too much ti me 
thinking. 

 

[break] 
 
I: You were talking about stopping in B ucharest for six weeks, and how the lessons 

continued during the trip. 

 
S: Yes we had been stranded in B ucharest because the deal ing wit h the boat company 
took a long time till they organized and purchase the boat, till the y find a person who was 

ready to maintain the boat and take the group t o Palestine. 

 
I: How many were i n the group? 
 

S: We were 1800. Half of it or the majority of it were girls, and the other group was boys. 

We joined t ogether wit h another orphanage home which was boys home. The y were 
outskirt of Bucharest in a little city, put up. After six weeks of living in Bucharest where 
we constantly conti nued to learn, and all the time looked for it that life should be as 

normal as i s possi ble for us. We were told one day that at last we are going to the port 
cit y and we are going t o board the ship. I can™t tell you how joyful it was for us. We were 
looking forward of living. Not knowing where we would be going, and how good it will 

be or how bad it wi ll be. Difficult, or what is waiting for us. 

 
I: Did you have some imaginings of what Israel would be like? 
 

S: Very lit tle, except the uncle who lived in Jerusalem and during the war when we were 

still living in Onod, he would writ e to us and he would describe the mountains of 

45
 
 
Jerusalem, t he beauty of the country. So we had a little bit  of desire. Also the y were 
teaching us in the school songs about Israel. Or the y would be telling us stories about the 
prophets who used to walk in the streets of Jerusalem. Or the temple that was in existence 
once upon a ti me and t here is a remaining wal l. So a little bit of a tast e or a little bit of an 

understandi ng we had. However, I wouldn™t say that we were very knowledgeable about 

what life is there. Nevertheless we had underst anding that  the Jewish people who were 
present at that ti me in Palestine, which is called toda y Israel, that they were seeki ng the 
Britains to leave the country and t hat there is conflict there. Because I don™t think that at 

that point we wanted to go to anywhere where life would be a conflict  again or war again, 

or hostility again. What  we wanted was to be j ust in nature and to see positive things. To 
see 
peacefulness among people, and love. Mai nl y really what we were seeking for was 
that the people love each other. Because a lot of us lost that faith that people can still 

love. That people care for each other. Except the united-ness of our people here and there 

during or after the holocaust.  
 That boat was waiti ng for us at the port. One t housand ei ght hundred people in a 
big ship, which was not actually a ship for transporting human beings. It was a ship 

transporting goods or ani mals. But we were delighted that we are heading to Palestine. 

The singing, the lectures on the boat. Somehow just to go and renew life in a different 
place, it was connected with a lot of hope. We were hoping that we are going to establish 
a new type of life. We are on the boat and wat er is coming in to t he ship, we are 

frightened we are goi ng to sink. They tried to fix the boat while we are in the boat and 

then one day after traveling they said that all the young people should go on the deck of 
the boat. We are encountered by the British. They don™t want to l et us into Palestine. 
 

I: Now how long had you been on the boat?  

 
S: About one week. Lots of us are sick, sea sick. 
 

I: Were you
 sea sick?  
 
S: No. I am alwa ys the lucky one. 

 

I: Was Esther sea sick? 
 
S: Yes sure. Yes she™s very sensiti ve until this day. We went on t he deck of the boat and 

we saw a huge mili tary boat greeting us. They were screaming to t he head of our boat, to 

our organizers that we should turn back t o Europe. So we started t o cry. We didn™t want 

46
 
 
to go back t o Europe anymore. Whatever i s waiting for us, just not back to Europe. So we 
were begging. Each one of us had the opportunity to speak in the loudspeaker and beg to 
the Britons, we are refugees who lost everybody. We suffered so much. We have nobody. 
We want to come to thi s country, we want to start a new life, please l et us in. So this went 

on for three four hours, the yelling, ‚yes™ ‚no™. Are you having a lot of mens? Are the y 

mil itary people? Do you bring any kind of ammunition. The y were frightened that the 
Jewish people would be strong and the y are going to oust the Britons from Palestine. 
After four hours about, or ma ybe it  was a l ittle bit longer, the y agreed that the y let us int o 

Palestine. The boat came to the port of Haifa. Just from the deck to see the beautiful 

mountains of Carmel, which is a huge mountain in Haifa, was very moving, very 
emotional. The nature. It was springtime it was end of Ma y. It™s beautiful in Israel, all the 
flowers are blooming already. As we came down from the boat our people, the y were 

greeting us and they were throwing to us all kinds of bags of goodies. The singi ng and t he 

hugging. Some people found some relatives, some friends. But t he Britons did not allow 
us to go out to the city. We were put  in a camp, which was not a concentration camp, it™s 
named Atlit. It was surrounded wi th gates and fence. It was a fenced in camp wi th army 

barracks. It was a very emotional kind of arrival to Israel which represents in our e ye the 

freedom. That™s what we are dreaming that  now we are going to be free from soldiers and 
from being observed al l the ti me, and here we are again encl osed in a closed camp 
situation. 

 

I: So what did that  feel like?  
 
S: It brought anger. It brought anger because we felt that the worl d still did not learn from 

the experience and from t he tragedy. We felt that we are people who actually all of us 

needed to be pampered, needed to be loved, needed so to say, in a resort place and given 
all what we could be gi ven and here we are i n a situation where we are closed in, we have 
no contact with the out side world again.  

 
I: So again you hoped, and again you had been disappoint ed. 
 

S: In a wa y, yes. Still, i t™s not to compare. Because we knew that eventually the y are 

going to fight for our freedom. They, the peopl e who organized thi s tri p. It™s called the 
Youth Aliyah, the Yout h ‚going up to Israel™. Lovely movement who wanted to save the 
children from remai ning in Europe with t he memories. The y felt that that™s the ri ght thing 

to do for them. 

 

47
 
 
I: So you had confidence they would be able to do this for them? 
 
S: Yes we had confidence. Still, we could move in the premises, we couldn™t leave the 
camp. It™s not to compare to the camps in Germany. We were given food. Some people 

had visitors. We slowly contacted our uncle in Jerusalem who sent is son in law and he 

sent goodies for us and he brought  us m y very first silk scarf. I got from m y uncle who 
sent it through the camp to us. He wanted that  we should feel human, we should feel as 
girls shoul d feel that you beautify a little yourself so he sent a scarf for me and for m y 

sister. I by nature cheri sh every lit tle new t hing. I don™t have to have big things. Every 

little new t hing I can be happy. In those da ys for sure that scarf meant so much. I was 
trying to put it around neck and my head and around m y face. All  kind of different things.  
 

I: What color was it? 

 
S: It was a blue wi th white and pi nk. I remember because I had one nice dress and it 
mat ched. The dress was blue. So we were in that situation but not too long because then 

from the Jewish agency, which has branches in America too, and it™s subsidized I think 

the mone y from here as well from Palestine. They came in and the y demanded from the 
British that young chil dren shoul d be let out. After three weeks bei ng in that camp we 
were let out.  The y gave us some ticket for a bus that woul d take us to Jerusalem. Because 

the y asked ﬁwhere is your destinat ion, where do you want to go?ﬂ My uncle who lived i n 

Jerusalem, he corresponded with my uncl e in Budapest. Prior to m y t rip in Palestine the 
two of them made a decision, since we had no parents, that we shoul d be attendi ng a 
certain kind of religious school in Jerusalem. That school happened t o have a dormitory. 

In that dormitory were the refugees, the survivors, the orphans. It was a kind of 

orphanage dormitory, still you didn™t feel like you were in a real orphanage home. It was 
more like a school dormitory. 
 

I: How did you feel about that decision? 
 
S: Well, in a way I felt that it was somebody that was making the decision I didn™t have 

to break m y head where to head and what to do. Later on, I wished that they wouldn™t 

make that decision for me. Perhaps I would have chosen a different school. This was a 
little bit more religious than I. It was a little bit  too pious, you know what I mean. It was 
a 
little bit too strict kind of a school. I wanted to go to a lesser. It™s l ike you go to a regular 

public school, or you go to the church school. This was more like a church school. Very 

restricted, orders. Very restricted how, code of dressing and code of behavior.  

48
 
 
 
I: What kinds of behavi or and dress? 
 
S: Very lit tle freedom in the evening, you coul d not leave the premises. You had to be 

home a certain time. In school you had to go with long sleeves and l ong skirts. 

 
I: Were there any boys in the school? 
 

S: No, only girls.  

 
I: You had to be very covered. 
 

S: Very much so, yes. So I woul dn™t have mind a little bit less st rict kind of situation.  

 
I: Was there more rel igious traini ng? More services? 
 

S: Yes, more than I was exposed at home. Though I am coming from a rabbinical family. 

But this was a littl e bit more to the right. But t he learning was on a high level. So I can™t 
complain. Because educationally I got what I wanted. I wanted very much to further m y 
education. In the beginning we had difficulty with the language.  

 

I: You and Esther. 
 
S: Yes me and Est her. 

 

I: And the language was Hebrew.  
 
S: Yes 

 
I: Were the other girls i n the school survi vors, or some of them not survivors? 
 

S: The majority of the students were local. Who lived, who were born and raised in 

Israel. In that ti me it  was called Palestine. The refugees were trained by private teachers 
in order that the y can cope with the material t hat the rest of the group was learning. They 
subsidized our learning sessions by taking us out some time from the regular class then 

privately teaching us. However, i n many things such as science or math or geography, we 

were ahead of the Israelis. Apparently the education in Europe was on a high level in 

49
 
 
certain areas and the religious education was much behind. So we needed mainly in 
language and religious studies such as the bibl e or the prophets, we needed a lot of help at 
the beginning. Or Jewi sh history. But in many other subjects we were much ahead of the 
local people.  

 

I: You had told me in an earlier interview that your father had arranged Hebrew lessons 
for you and your si ster and brother. Did that include spoken Hebrew?  
 

S: That included spoken Hebrew but that was so little. It was really.. We knew certain 

expressions, you know. But we were not able t o converse i n Hebrew.  
 
I: So not only did you have trouble with the cl asses because of spoken Hebrew
, butwas it 

hard for you to make friends also because of t he language? 

 
S: It was i n a wa y maybe, but it wasn™t really because the girls were very outgoing. I 
remember being invited to several of m y friends who were very outgoing to help us and 

to try to make us feel good and bei ng in homes sometimes. Not only to be in the 

dormitory. W
e were invited to their homes.  
 
I: Were they day students or boarder students? 

 

S: They were da y students. Only the refugees were the ones who l ived in the dormitories. 
Only the orphans. It wasn™t easy at the begi nni ng. Certain subject s took us a long long 
time to be able to j oin in with the rest of the group. But t he y made us feel good that in 

other subjects we were ahead. Such as mat h or science. The y alwa ys used to sa y ﬁwe 

teach you 
Hebrew, we teach you prophets, and you teach us other thingsﬂ. 
 

I: Did you have much contact with your family at that poi nt, with your uncle? 

 
S: With m y uncle we were most of the ti me on the Shabbat, on the hol ida y, visiti ng here 
or there for a meal. We never slept over by m y uncle. For different reasons. The boarding 

school didn™t like t he idea that we are not back in the evenings. Also, the y lived in a very 

poor condit ion. Housing was very difficult in those da ys in Israel. My uncle who had 
three children lived in a two bedroom apart ment. It would mean that we would be living 
or sleeping in the li ving room, which we didn™t want to cause such a commotion in the 

house. But  we went usually for a meal here and there. It was very refreshing. My aunt 

was a highly intelli gent  woman. My uncle was a rabbi in Frankfurt amei n. The y alw
a ys  

50
 
 
tried to tell us things what a parent would guide us.   
  
I: So your uncle before the war was a rabbi in frankfurt amein, was he a refugee before 
the holocaust? 

 

S: He went  in 1939, he got certificates from the Britons, which meant he was invited, 
allowed citi zen to enter Palestine. They had certain quotas. I remember that in this 
country also you have quotas, how many people can come from Hungary, how many 

refugees can come from other country. Now l ot of times we hear other stories. When I 

came to thi s country I also came on a quota. So m y uncle went from Frankfurt amein to 
Palestine in 1939 right after Kristal Nacht. They were also not too long in the country. A 
few years. But the y established a nice kind of a life. It was very refreshing to talk with 

m y uncle. He woul d tel l us beautiful stories about our parents. He remi nded us those da ys 

we came to visit. 
 
I: So you had known hi m before. 

 

S: Yes. We had known him. Both of them very outstanding peopl e, I remember that one 
day m y uncletook me and mysi
ster to a store in Jerusalem and he bought a pocketbook 
for us. There were more i mportant  things ma ybe, but he wanted so much to give us the 

feeling that we are girls. That we are human, t hat we have a pocket book just like every 

other girl has.  
 
I: So that was very important to you. 

 

S: It was very. I have a picture standing by the store when we went  out. Believe me m y 
uncle wasn™t well t o do, to buy thi s kind of things. Yet for him it  was very i mport ant to 
give as many things as we could in order t o make us feel that yes we live a normal life, 

and we are human beings, and we are just l ike all the other girls after t he war. We walked 
with that pocketbook so proud. I wish to see today teenagers woul d cherish something 
that we get as we cherished those pocketbooks. For years, I think only a couple years ago 

I gave it awa y. I kept t hat pocketbook even though I was not usi ng it because I couldn™t 

depart from it. Because it was so meaningful, so special. That was the very first, the scarf 
that he sent to the cam p. Then this pocket book were the very first thi ngs as a young 
teenager I had, and I wasn™t different from others.  

 

I: So where did you give such a special thing?  

51
 
 
 
S: Where di d I give it? I gave it to a girl who was visiting me from Poland. In fact, it™s 
not for the tape but we have now also a girl here who came to study from Poland. I am i n 
contact wit h a girl who the parents were survi vors and the y went back to Poland to live 

and this girl is a young girl, her parents are not  young people you know, and she™s here to 

study and she™s so determi ned so it brings back to me so many memories. How 
determined how she wants to live a normal life.  
 

I: Does it remind you of yourself? 

 
S: A lot. 
 

I: So this is important for the tape. 

 
S: Oh. If I should put this story i n.  
 
I: Did you know her parents? How did you find each other? 

 
S: She was visiti ng a librarian from the school where I am teaching. She goes to a school 
in Silver Spring, and the daughter of the librarian of m y school goes also to that school 

and the y invited her. So she said ﬁYaffa I think that for you it would be a very 

meaningful experience to meet wit h this girlﬂ. And low and behol d it was a very 
meaningful experience and I want her to come for a meal to visit me also. 
 

I:Had you wished that someone 
would do that for you when you first arrived in Israel? 
 
S: Very much so. 
 

I: So giving her the pocketbook was really very meaningful for you.  
 
S: Very much so. Very much so. I always wanted that somebody woul d appreciate as 

much as I appreciated. It would be used by somebody that it would be meaningful for. 

 
I: So you feel you found the right person for the pocketbook. 
 

S: I think so. Back to Jerusalem. 

 

52
 
 
I: Who paid for the school that you were going to? 
 
S: It was paid by t he Jewish agenc y. I remember one thing that I want ed to tell, when we 
were let out from the camp, we were just given money to take the bus to Jerusalem. There 

was no straight bus from the camp situated next to Haifa to go to Jerusalem. We had to 

stop over in Tel Aviv. As we are standing wai ting for the connecti ng bus a lady 
approaches us, she heard me talking to Est her i n Hungarian, she approaches us and she™s 
sayi ng ﬁwho are you?ﬂ We told her our story, we are children of the rabbi of Onod. 

ﬁWhere are you going?ﬂ ﬁWe are goi ng to Jerusalemﬂ. This was before a holida y. She 

says ﬁwell I knew your family from Europe, I am here in t his country a few years, do you 
need anything?ﬂ We said ﬁno we don™t need nothingﬂ. However she ran and she bought 
for us some cake and she bought for us some candy and chocolate and she pushed into 

our pocket a very small amount of mone y but that was the very first mone y that we had in 

our pocket. She hugged us and she said ﬁgod bless you, thank god I see some young 
people who survived the concentrati on campsﬂ. A million ti mes I wanted to find out who 
this lady was? What was she doing at the bus stop? She wasn™t travel ing. Later on when I 

told, many times when I repeated thi s story because I was very moved by it, that 

somebody specially found for her task to go to stations of bus or shi ps or wherever, 
ma ybe ma ybe she will find some survivors and she would be able to give them a few 
things to cheer them up. Once I tol d this story to a cousin of mine and she said, ﬁ you 

know who this was? this lady was a sister i n law of m y si ster who died after the war in 

Budapest.ﬂ She didn™t know that we are related, I mean it™s not real relation there is 
contact whatever. Many ti mes I learned from t his, not many ti mes, but I learned from this 
I also like to go places where I know there i s a need to cheer up peopl e, if its an old age 

home or an orphanage home because I always feel I remember. It was little, it was smal l, 

but it was very much on time. That little bit of package that  she had given to us and the 
few
 pennies that she put in our pocket. So I hope that I wil l be able for many years to 
cheer up people and continue to do what I learned from that one experience. 
 Back to Jerusalem. I had difficulties learning in the beginning but slowly it got 
each ti me better thanks to lots of the girls who came and learned wi th us and invited to 
their houses, it was not only the learning session but being invited into normal homes and 

seeing that there are families. That not everything had been wiped away during the 

holocaust, gave us a lot  of strength. A good meal here and t here sometimes because it 
was a very poor ti me in Israel. The food in the orphanage home was again fairl y meager. 
But we ate, we ate bread. Here and there some potato. It was very hel pful to be again 

among people who were cheerful who were happy, seeing children, seeing babies. I 

remember that I was very moved when I saw t hat babies are so pretty and that mommi
es 

53
 
 
are pushing carriages. I thought that the whole world had been wi ped away and that only 
a few of us remained. But I saw t hat life was going on and famil ies were together and 
they built homes. The y were worki ng and t he y were learning. It was a normal kind of a 
life. Unfortunatel y I had to go through again a war in Israel in 1947. The independence 

war of Israel. Then t he British were ousted and the Arabs attacked us. I have been visiting 

a friend of mine in Jerusalem and as I was returning back on the road to the orphanage 
home, I see that somehow the street is empty. That was very unusual for a Saturda y 
afternoon. People used to stroll in the street, that™s the da y of rest. I hear boom boom 

boom, and I don™t see nobody. So I ran to a dit ch in the road and I was just hidi ng m yself 

there knowing this kind of things from t he experience in the holocaust. Then I hear from 
one window somebody screaming ﬁcome in! come in!ﬂ So I went into the house and the y 
took me down to t he basement whi ch was a semi-kind of a shelter. They told me that I 

can™t continue to go. ﬁYou can™t go back t o your orphanage place, the dormitory because 

the Arabs at tacked usﬂ. So I went through a di fficult time in Israel very shortly after our 
arrival.  
 We arrived in ™46, ™47 already. Started wit h the British with the Arabs and then t he 

Independence war. Jerusalem was sieged. There was no water. There was no wa y to get  

out from the city to come back. And yet, I don™t know, with all that suffering I never gave 
up. And it wasn™t so depressing, 
because you weretogetherwith many people. Yousaw 
families. It wasn™t t hat we had to be surrounded. It wasn™t  that we had to be hearing the 

gas chamber or smelling the smoke of the gas. Here we were fighting for our own 

independence. It was a very different kind of a feeling. It wasn™t easy. It was not pleasant . 
But not to compare. 
 

I: You didn™t feel helpl ess as you had? 

 
S: No. Not helpless, not at all. We had faith in our soldiers. We had faith in Hashem, in 
God you know. But it was difficult. Food was very poor. The main problem in Jerusalem 

was water. The y used t o give out a bucket of water per family. That™s how difficult it 
was. For the ti me being, school was closed.  
 

I: You were still li ving in the orphanage. 

 
S: Still in the orphanage. 
 

I: But yo
u weren™t havi ngclasses. 
 

 

54
 
 
S: We had no classes because we were attacked and they were afraid to have chil dren in 
the street. In those da ys children were walki ng to school. Even on the bus it was not safe. 
But after a while they reopened back the school. I left Jerusalem during the siege with an 
armor car. They took down some children to Tel Aviv because the y felt that it was very 

dangerous to be in Jerusalem. Esther, m y sister, by that ti me was working in Tel  Aviv. So 

I went there.  
 
I: So she was not i n school. 

 

S: She wasn™t in the school with me. She was only for one year and she learned to sew. 
She went to a vocat ional school. I went to regular gymnasium.  
 

I: So Esther did not go to the same school in Jerusalem that you did. 

 
S: No. Not to the same school.  
 

I: But she was in Jerusalem.  

 
S: She was in the same dormitory. The y established for girls who were unable to do 
spiritual ki nd of things or scholasti c kind of things. Who were more broken from t he war. 

Esther was, even though she was much bri ghter, for her learning is very easy, I had to 

work on my studies all the ti me all my life. Sti ll she just couldn™t go back to the books. 
The y found that it™s the best thing for certai n girls to be busy with thei r hands instead of 
being busy with their minds. 

 

I: So you were separated from Est her again. 
 
S: I was separated from Esther. The first time separated after. Because after the camp she 

was in a sanatorium but I was not really separated because we were both in Budapest. 
Here we were also not separated, we lived together in the dormitory. Then we were 
separated because once she learned her profession, sewing, she got a j ob and she went to 

Tel Aviv. Also you have to know t hat after a certain age the y did not keep the girls in the 

dormitory. 
 
[break] 

 

I: You were talking about Esther in Tel Aviv and you were still i n Jerusalem, and that 

55
 
 
was the first time that you were separated. How did you take that , bei ng separated from 
Esther, even though you knew that  it was important for her to be doi ng what she was 
doing?  
 

S: In a wa y it was very difficult because I had nobody except her. Bei ng the older sister 

who all the ti me felt a certain kind of responsi bility and being a substitute mother in a 
way, as much she could. But by t hat time, perhaps due to m y friends that were very very 
careful and very giving and very supporting, it was a little bit easier t o take that 

separation. We were i n constant touch wit h each other. But then when Jerusalem was 

surrounded I could not leave and she could not come to visit. That  was a little bit  
difficult, because the fear was there. There was hope but there was a fear too, who knows 
how long will be t his separation and when wil l I be able to see her again. She was the one 

who initiat ed that I should be leavi ng Jerusalem. It wasn™t easy because you coul d not as 

a civilian leave the ci ty. Soldiers were going i n secret ways and the y organized that once 
in a while to unite sisters or unite families they would take each ti me a few people. So 
happened that she made this arrangement with a convoy of soldiers I went from 

Jerusalem. Which was kind of a dangerous tri p to do, from Tel Aviv. She made 

arrangement in Tel Avi v for me that I coul d continue in the same kind of school setting 
that I had been attending in Jerusalem and also in an orphanage home. There were 
orphanage homes established by t he Jewish agenc y in different cities all over in Israel. So 

I went back to school. I continued m y learning. Esther was visiting me on a daily basis. 

She was learning a little bit of mone y so she bought a blouse for me or some ext ra little 
food. Eventually after being in that orphanage home for about a year, we rented a little 
room with a privilege of using a little bit a kitchen. We joined together again and lived on 

our own. This was about 1948.  

 
I: So you were 16. 
 

S: Yes. I continued to go to school and Esther continued to go to her work. We li ved by a 
family who rented out one little room and we were able to use one lit tle burner in our 
room. Make once in a while food or a littl e bi t of soup. It was an interesting kind of 

situation because we felt that we are again i ndependent. That one l ittl e room, even though 

it was a rented room. But we felt that we are no more orphans. That we are like living a 
normal life like other people are living. We were very friendly with t he people who 
rented us the place out. The y were very nice to us, very intelligent people who helped me 

a lot with my learni ng also. Then we made friends, neighbors. There was a piano teacher 

who was very much looking out t hat we shoul d come to her house, that we shoul d be in a 

56
 
 
family envi ronment once in a while. She li ved with her mother, she had two young 
children, and I loved to go to visi t there. She had a brother who was a teacher, a matter a 
fact I wanted to learn a little bit English because by that ti me I had a command of the 
Hebrew language. I wanted some other foreign language to learn because I alwa ys 

wanted to be a teacher and I knew that eventually need more languages to know.    

 
I: Did you assume that you would live in Israel for the rest of your life? 
 
S: At that ti me I assumed that I would be i n Israel and I am going to establish a family 

life eventually. It is very i nteresting to not e that he was teaching me and he was always 
looking m y handwriting. This is t he brot her of the music teacher who were the neighbors 
of where we had been l iving. It™s outskirt s of Tel Aviv, outskirt between Tel Aviv and 

Ramat Gan. 

 
I: So you were goi ng there for English lessons. 
 

S: For English lessons. Free of charge. Just me. Whenever I came he used to be amazed 

with my handwriti ng. I don™t know, I was young and very foolish. I didn™t notice that 
actually he is teaching because he i s in love with me not because he really was interested 
to teach me.  

 

I: Why did you thi nk he wasn™t charging you? 
 
S: I thought that so many people wanted to help, all the refugees i n many different ways. 

Some who could help financially, some who could help educating them. I thought this the 

other, yes. I was real ly not interest ed in that ti me yet to get married. Nevertheless if IŠ 
 
I: Now you™re about 17 

 
S: At this point 16 17, going on 17. He wanted to take me to a theatre. It™s not only that  I 
wasn™t interested because humanity came back to me and for sure I was the age of sixteen 

and a half, seventeen something is moving in you, and you do feel you are a girl and this 

is a man. B ut he was not attractive at all. I reall y didn™t want to be too much in his 
company. I enjoyed learning, but t hat™s about i t. Later on he was expressing that he wants 
to really dat e me, and t hat he want s to go with me and I said that I™m too young yet. 

 

I: How old was he? 

57
 
 
 
S: He was much older, he was much older. He must have t o been 28, 29, much older than 
I. Many many years later when I was already a momm y of two children and I visited in 
Israel I happened to be in the temple with his mother, who loved me very much so. Later 

I understood why t he y were so much invit ing us to the house because the y had a plan in 

their mind for the son t o marry me. She said t o me ﬁnowﬂ later, years later ﬁnow you can 
tell me, you are married and my son is married, why didn™t you want  to have Sully for 
your husband?ﬂ I said to her ﬁdon™t ask me such questions.ﬂ But  I know what I was 

thinking at  the age of 16 and I didn™t want ed to tell her that he was not attract
ing me, you 

can™t sa y that to a mother. But I started wit h hi m t o learn, and wit h the sister I was 
learning a li ttle bit music. I wanted very much to get back to all the thi ngs that m y parent s 
wanted to give us. Unfortunately i t was interrupted by the Germans. But it was very 

difficult because we di dn™t have the means financially that  I could go study music or take 

private lessons in Engli sh. So here was the opportunity but that had to stop after I learned 
that there are other alt ernative mot ivations than just giving us t he extra lessons.  
 

I: So after you figured out what was going on you stopped the lessons? 

 
S: I stopped the lessons. I stopped the lessons.  
 

I: Was that hard for you to do? 

 
S: It was because I wanted very much to further in any wa y, in every way, my education. 
But I was involved in the school and event uall y I learned a little bit music from other 

sources. I finished t he high school. Not t oo many years after it I met my husband and I 

got married withhim.
 
 
I: How did you meet hi m? 

 
S: My husband was livi ng by the principal of my school. In Tel Aviv. I was in Tel Aviv 
at school.  

 

I: What school? 
 
S: In Tel Aviv, it™s call ed Beit Yakov. My husband was living in their house and one da y, 

she said to m y husband. He was a boarder t here. People used to take rooms by families. 

He said ﬁI have a lovely girl, and I think that t his girl is just for you. She has a very 

58
 
 
si milar kind of a background.ﬂ Alt hough m y husband was in Israel from 1939 and I only 
came in 1946, but the background i s very simil ar.  
 
I: In what way was it si mil ar. 

 

S: Si milar because he comes from Czechoslovakia from where m y father was, in the very 
same city. He went to t he same school that  m y father went before he went in many years, 
but it was t he same kind of setting. More or less from the same type of religious 

background. Educat ionall y the same type. Financially, everybody was so called ‚middle 

class™. But what did we call ‚middle class™, if you had a room and a bed that was called 
‚mi ddle class™ in those days. So he was in the arm y at that time and he had furlough, a 
few days of vacation from the army and he sai d ﬁif you come to t he school I will  

introduce to you the girl that I am mentioningﬂ. My husband knew me from before. 

Seeing me in the st reet of Tel Aviv. He used to walk with his buddy from the arm y. He 
would sa y to hi m ﬁ you see that girl  that blonde one, I will take her out ﬂ. He knew me 
from even before when we attended the weddi ng of my teacher Esther Eckshtein, who 

was my teacher after the war. She i s related to m y husband, she™s a second cousi n. Which 

I didn™t know unti l the wedding. I went as a st udent of her to the wedding. He went as a 
relative. I was introduc ed to her at the wedding. But nothing more than this is one of my 
students.  

 So when he was on vacation from the army he went to the school and I was called 

out from the class t hat I have to go to the office, the princi pal want s t o see me. My heart 
was beating, I thought ﬁgod, did I fail in t he past, did I do something wrong? why am I 
called to the office?ﬂ She said to me somebody wants to meet you. Here on the porch of 

the office building is a soldier in uniform and he tells me ﬁI have t wo da ys off from the 

arm y, I want to take you to a night outﬂ.  
 I said ﬁI have to ask my sisterﬂ. I was, you know, I had no parent s, with whom am 
I talking anyt hing over? I said by t he way, you know, m y sister is ol der and she has to get 

married before me. Low and behold, I don™t want to elaborate on thi s story but  slowly 
from this, within a year it developed a friendship to an ext ent that we got engaged and 
married.  

 

I: So how old were you when you met? 
 
S: Nineteen. Eighteen in the school. I was at t he age of nineteen when I got married. 

 

I: And you were sti ll in school. 

59
 
 
 
S: I was still in school. I continued to.. 
 
I: This was the equival ent to a coll ege. 

 

S: This was already then, yes. It was a teacher seminary. Which we don™t have a l ot 
today. 
 

I: We used to have a lot. 

 
S: Yeah, but we don™t have anymore. I know that near to Allentown. Kutstown. Has a 
teacher™s seminary. But it™s very very rare now. I think t hat it™s something that I™d like to 

see that it™s coming back again. 

 
I: So you were still in school and he was st ill in the army when you married? 
 

S: He was still in the army when I married my husband.  

 
I: You were then ni neteen.  
 

S: Yeah. And it wasn™t an easy life, but we were very happy. We lived in one room 

apartment which was our living room and dini ng room and later on when my baby came 
it was even the baby room. We were very happy. Very happy. I™m very t hankful for 
everything. This was the first baby, m y son, that was born in our fami ly. The first child 

after the holocaust. Very very moving moment . I remember when from Yale they 
interview me for the holocaust test imony and t his was the highli ght of m y life when this 
baby was born. Because that minute I felt that there is cont inuation and that the nation 
and the people are renewing and getting back t heir strength.  

 
I: And what did you name hi m? 
 

S: I named hi m after my husband™s father who perished al so in the holocaust, Gabrielle. 

We wanted, while I was pregnant we were discussing all the ti me. Each one of us lost 
both sets of parents and each one of us lost a brother. So as many children we will have 
we would l ike that in t hat wa y their name should not be forgotten. So we will name the 

children. I wanted t o be a good wife and I said if it™s a girl I will  name it after my mother, 

if it™s a boy it will be after your father. So i t was a boy. This one that is getting now 

60
 
 
married is named after m y mother. But we have four children, and it™s after the four 
parents.  
 
I: So you have two boys and two girls.  

 

S: Two boys and t wo girls. Now t he life was not easy. I have to sa y to you, after the 
holocaust. We were in Israel even after we got married. We lived i n one room. We shared 
a kitchen three famili es together. It was an apartment of three rooms and in each room 

one couple was livi ng and the kitchen we divided and three women were sharing t hat 

kitchen. But there was a lot of happiness, there was a lot of positiveness. There was a lot 
of sharing and doing together things, and respectfulness, trying to cheer each other.  
 

I: Were the other wom en older than you? 

 
S: Yes. I was the youngest.  
 

I: Before we started the interview we were talking about your learning to cook and how 

you didn™t have a chance for your mother t o t each you and that when you were married 
you didn™t know very much about cooking. You lived wi th Esther. Did you learn 
some of 
that cooking when you lived with Esther? 

 

S: Well, when I lived with Esther, Esther was mainly in charge of the cooking. I was 
mai nly in charge of cleaning and ironing. I was not so much interested in cooking. I was 
more into books in those days.  

 

I: How was it after you got married in those days? 
 
S: After I got marri ed i t was difficult. I remember that once I tried t o make a cake 

because my husband said that it would be nice on the da y of Shabbat to have a cup of 
coffee with a piece of homemade cake. Bakeri es were not in exist ence. It was too 
expensive if it was here and there a bakery. Who could afford? I attempted to make a 

caked. It was a yeast cake and it wouldn™t rise. So what should I do? It™s already 

afternoon and it™s nothi ng moving, it™s soon the holiday coming, t he Shabbat, I am not 
able to bake anymore. So I took t hat dough and I put it i n the garbage can, and one thing I 
forgot was that I should have been wrapping it or hiding it more, that  was the task of m y 

husband that he came home that he helped me to take down the garbage from the 

apartment and into t he dumpster to put it. As he was throwing it he saw the dough, he 

61
 
 
didn™t say nothing. Shabbat morni ng I was serving coffee and I had a piece of chocolate. 
He says ﬁah it woul d be nice to have a piece of cake but what can we do it™s in t he 
dumpster.ﬂ So I knew that he noticed the dough. But slowly, I don™t know, very little. I 
am not a big cook today ei ther. I am admiri ng how m y daughter i s cooking, she is a really 

gourmet cooking. I do si mple things. The tast e I think came back, remembering from the 

home. I remember how it tasted, a good potato soup. I remember t he dill that mother was 
using, or t he petrosil. Or seeing her doing things. Eventually, certain things come back t o 
you. And from experience. As my husband says I experi mented on hi m. He had to be the 

one to eat certain foods that was not so good. But thank god, he survi ved. Forty seven 

years we wi ll be married in April. So apparentl y something went good.  
 
I: So back t o your schooling. You were in school when you were married. 

 

S: I was in school after I got married. I was in school for a very long t ime, and at the very 
early age I was still in school and married. I went to teach in outskirt in Tel Aviv. At that 
time the head of the country of Israel was Ben Gurion, which is a known name. He asked 

all the students who went to teach a seminar, t o volunteer and go out to teach because the 

influx of the immigration was so high and Israel was not ready and prepared with enough 
teachers
. So it was counted to a cert ain degree as credit towards our learning. We went 
out to teach in remote places, outskirt, m y job was in a sl um area of Tel Aviv, m y first 
job. I had forty two students in the class. Not being an experienced teacher was not re
ally 

an easy task. I was t eaching first grade. Reading. I remember, I counted that at least thirty 
different countries were the children from and many different languages. But I still 
cherish that year. Because it was not only teaching those children, but  helping them to 

adjust to a new life again. Later on I was teaching, mainly that the y came from Morocco. 

I remember, I wasn™t  yet married when I was already helpi ng out in that special 
observation center t o teach children and I used to take home to bat he children. I was not 
only teachi ng, but I was teaching t he parent s because the y came from Morocco from 

caves that they lived in and the y had very l ittl e knowledge to maintai n hygiene l ife at 
home. I used to take home children for the weekend, that they should have a little bit 
better food, better home. A matter of fact I got sick from one of the children, they had a 

lot of problems wi th e ye infections. Trachoma. And I developed from this one lit tle 

gorgeous beautiful chil d a bathed her, I put  her next to me in bed, I didn™t have extra bed 
anyway, and she was sl eeping with me. So m y husband i s always teasing me that  when I 
said to hi m ﬁ yes I marry youﬂ, I was not seeing well because I had that sickness of m y 

eye. 
 
 But it was pioneer years. Everyone was doing. Everyone was helpi ng. So even if 

62
 
 
we had a lot of difficulties, we felt that we are all together building back a normal kind of 
a life. A new home for all of us. That we are establishing back a nation that has been 
destroyed. Until this day when I see a pregnant woman I bless, because it means that one 
more life is coming to t his world. It™s strengthening again the humani ty. There is one 

more instead of the ones that have been wi ped. We have to replace t he ones who we lost. 

So it was a very, it was like the spring. The springtime is the time when everything is 
starting to come to life. That™s how those years will be al wa ys remembered by me. 
Difficult, in one way it was very lit tle income, it was very hard to find a job to have 

normal livi ng quart ers or any luxurious condit ion. Who had a car, who had.. we walked 

to places, and we never minded because we were all determined to try to prove t o us, t o 
the world and to humanity that with all we went through we are back to humanity and we 
are building back a normal  kind of a life.  

 So I think that gave us a lot of courage, a lot of strength, and a lot  of hope, seeing 

that things are getting back to normal.  
 
I: So this year when you were teaching in t he outskirts, you had finished school. 

 

S: I finished school two ye ars after I was married. I was t eaching more. I was teaching 
and going to school at t he same ti me.  
 

I: Your school was training elementary education? 

 
S: Element ary education. Yes, I alwa ys wanted pri mary grades. Until  this da y, it™s fort y 
years that I am teaching and alwa ys, always, young children.  

 

I: So you finished going to school , and you had finished when you had been marri ed for 
two years.
 
 

S: I had been married, in fact I had been pregnant. And I had been teaching and going to 
school. I continued even after I had a baby. I went to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. 
Ihave m y B.A.in the 
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. 

 

I: Did you transfer or finished one school 
 
S: I finished one school  and then I started t he other school at the 
Hebrew
 University. 
Then we came to thi s country as exchange teachers.  

 

63
 
 
I: And then your husband was out  of the army. 
 
S: My husband was out of the arm y very shortl y after we were married. Very shortly I 
was pregnant with my first son after he was out of the army. He went back to his 

profession. He™s a high school teacher. He was back to teaching. 

 
I: What was his subject ? 
 

S: His subject was 
Talmud
 and bi ble and prophets and we were both a couple of teachers. 
Then we came as exchange teachers. 
 
I: Why did you decide to do that? 

 

S: Teaching?  
 
I: No to come as exchange teachers. 

 

S: Because Esther, my sister, got married about a year and a half after I married. She 
married a rabbi from America in Israel. He was visiting in Israel and he met her, and the y 
got engaged and the y got married and she had to wait for papers t o joi n him here back. 

He was a rabbi near to Pittsburgh  named a place Braddock. She came out, and we didn™t  

see each other for a couple years. When this opportunity came that I could come to the 
state as an exchange teacher I was very happy to do that because I wanted to see m y 
sister.  

 

I: So you t hought  you™d be able to spend some time. 
 
S: Yes. We came for t wo years teaching i n a school named Yeshiva of Flatbush. One of 

the best Jewish 
da y schools
 in this country, in Brooklyn.  
 
I: How many children did you have when you came? 

 

S: I had two sons when I came. I came with two sons, the y are Israeli born, m y boys. 
Citizens of America because after a while, you get your citizenship here. Esther moved at  
that ti me to New York, and I was in New York and we saw each other al most on a da
ily 

basis. She had children so we, the cousins, played together. After the two years we 

wanted to return, as exchange teachers. We were asked in Allentown Pennsylvania 
was a 

64
 
 
school established a couple years prior to our coming to this country, and they asked us to 
help them out. They had problems with the principal with the teachers, and the y said to us 
ﬁknowing you as pioneer kind of people who l ike to buil d and want t o do, could you do 
us this much a favor that you extend your stay. We make the arrangements for you, and 

stay.ﬂ Low and behold we stayed ten years i n Allentown. Ten years until we established 

that school and it™s a flourishing school. We are still in contact wi th some people, it™s 
already over twenty five years that we left that place. We st ill have some people that are 
in touch with us. 

 

I: When did you decide to sta y permanently in the United States? 
 
S:About 27 years ago, 30 yearsago.
 
 

I: How did you make that decision. 
 
S: Well I tell you, I love Israel, but I am very t hankful to this country. It has been very 

good to us and I li ke the education that m y chi ldren were acquiring here. I felt that after 

Europe this is a country that gives a lot of freedom. I wouldn™t go back to any of the 
countries in Europe. I am amazed whoever is able to live t here. There are people who 
went back. But this country is really a home to me. 

 

I: You talked about  Israel as though you might have felt at home t here. 
 
S: Well Israel or America. These are the two places that I can see m yself living. But that 

time the decision to remain was mainly t hat m y kids had very good education and I felt 

that I can gi ve them University education here much easier. If I made the right decision. 
Thank god I raised four very beautiful and very well educated chil dren who cont ribute to 
the country as much the country has contribut ed to us.  

 
I: So your children were feeling at home here and were get ting plugged in to things. 
 

S: Yes. And then I went also to the high university in Bethlehem, that ™s near Allentown 

and I got m y master degree in children literature there. It™s very hard t o jump one place to 
the other place. We spent a lot of time in Israel , we have a l ittle condominium in 
Jerusalem. As much we can we spend. When I got there I try as much I can to be with 

young children. This whole desire of being with children and teachi ng I think comes from 

the ti me that we were in the cattle car and we were going towards Auschwitz, and the 

65
 
 
crying in the night of the children, which is still ringing in m y ear. I was very young but 
yet ther
e were younger children who never made it. I tried to sing to them, I remembered 
a lot of stories. Our house was a house where momma was into poetry and m y father was 
always readi ng to us in the evening. Or wal king with us near to t he bank of the river. He 

would alwa ys tell us st ories. So I used those st ories and cal med the children. And the y all  

took to me during the trip of the few days. At that time I somehow, it  went through m y 
mind that ma ybe one day that would be my profession. Even though m y parents 
encouraged that I go into medicine. But ma ybe that woul d be bett er for me. So when I 

came back from the war, I started. I alwa ys have been tutoring younger children or 

helping the ones who needed in certain areas. It came to me very nat urally. 
 
I: So teachi ng has always been an i mportant part of your l ife, and you go back to the time 

you were in the cattl e car with the children. You™ve been t eaching for most of your life I 

gather. 
 
S: That™s very right. I have been teaching for most of my life, and I hope to cont inue for 

many years. What I like, that I want to give to m y students, not only knowledge, but 

strength, and hope and stamina, just to teach t hem. That t he y should alwa ys cheri sh the 
positive and not to dwell on the negative. I thi nk that comes from my experience as a 
holocaust survivor. And to tell them the story on their own level. 

 

  
I: Well I thi nk you have lots more to tell us. I think we will concl ude this intervi ew with 
you and then pick up on another day with more of your st ory. Thank you very much, Mrs. 

Munk for giving your t esti mony t oda y. 

 
S: You are very wel come and I look forward to being wi th you again and tell as much I 
can for the future generation to know.  

 
I: This concludes the Holocaust Memorial Museum interview wit h Yaffa Munk.
