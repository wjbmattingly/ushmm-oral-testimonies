After Hungary allied its elf with Nazi Ger many, Is tvan and Margit los t their jobs  due to new laws  
r es tr ic ting the par tic ipation of J ews  in the ec onomy.  Istvan was  then consc r ipted into the Hungarian 
labor  battalions.  German troops  occ upied Hungary in Mar c h 1944, and the Pic k  family was  first forced 
to move into buildings marked with the yellow s tar, like that seen in this  photo.  That fall the fam ily went 
into hiding.
 
 
But the Pick family was  dis c overed.  The c hildr en were taken and George was  plac ed in a 
hom e with 500 other c hildren.  George and another  boy es c aped and went back  to their hiding place 

wher e George was  reunited with his  parents.  Two weeks  later  the entir e fam ily was s ent to the ghetto.  
They were liberated from the ghetto by the Soviets  in J anuar y
 
1945.  In this  1946 photograph we s ee 
George with a gr oup of sur vivors , all of with whom  the Pick  family had been in hiding.  The c irc le is  on 

George.
 
 
Following the war, George lived in Hungary, where he earned a degree in engineering, until 
late 1956 when he esc aped from Hungary and m ade his  way to the United States to live with his  unc le 

in New J er s ey.  After working as  a laborer George got a s cholar s hip for an intens ive Englis h language 
c our se at Tem ple Univers ity in Philadelphia.  He then went to work  for Wes tinghous e as an engineer.  
George would later  teach engineering at
 
the Catholic  Univer s ity of Am er ic a here in the Distr ic t of 
Columbia.  After earning his  Ph.D., he worked for  the U.S. Navy as  an aeros pac e engineer fr om

V ir ginia.
 
 
While George c ontinues  to do c ons ulting work, a great deal of his  time is  spent working on two 
books.  He recently c ompleted his  autobiography and is  c urr ently looking for  a publis her.  The s ec ond is  
a s c holarly wor k about the his tor y of 40 J ewis h c om munities in a partic ular r egion of Hungar y that he is  
c urr ently wr iting.
 
 
George and his wife, Letic ia Flores  Pick , who retired fr om the Mex ic an For eign Ser vic e, live in 
Ar lington, Virginia.  Letic ia was  unable to join us today but us ually we'll find
 
her at George's  s ide.  
George perform s s ever al r oles as  a volunteer
 
here at the mus eum.  He s peaks frequently, es pec ially at 
loc al high sc hools  and univers ities , for the Speak er s  Bur eau.  He has  als o s poken at s uc h plac es as  the 

National Defens e Univers ity and the Departm ent of Defens e's Offic e of Inspec tor General.  George als o 

works  for the m us eum's  Educ ation Departm ent and Vis itor  Ser vic es .  You will find George here ever y 
other Sunday wher e he wor ks  with the m us eum's Movie Ser ies .
 
 
George als o is  a professor  at the Enc ore Lear ning Center of George Mas on Univer s ity wher e 
he just finis hed a s even
-
par t s er ies of lec tur es  entitled "Adventures  in Sc ienc e."  Beginning in October 
he will teac h a s er ies on the Holoc aus t. And when he has s pare tim e on his  hands ,
 
George als o works  
with ReSET, an organization of volunteer s  that teac hes  s c ienc e.  Over the pas t c ouple of years George 

has  taught 4th gr aders  in the Bar rett Elem entary Sc hool in Arlington, Virginia.
 
 
With that I would like you to join me in welc om ing our
 
First Per s on, Mr .
 
George Pick.
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
> > George Pick :  Thank you.  Thank  you.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  George, thank  you for joining us  and your  willingnes s  to be our Firs t Pers on today.  

You have s o muc h to s hare with us .  So we'll jump right in and get 
s tar ted.
 
 
You wer e nearly 4
 
1/2 years  old when Germ any invaded Poland in September
 
1939 and 
WorldWar II began.  Befor e we turn to the war  and the Holoc aus t, tell us  about your fam ily and your  
c om m unity in the year s  leading up to the war . 
 
> > George Pick : 
 
My family 
--
 
and I have s ome doc um ents  to s uppor t this 
--  
had been living in that ar ea 
whic h his toric ally was  the 
Au
s tr o
-
Hungarian 
E
m pir e for  over  250 year s .  My gr eat grandparents and 
great, gr eat grandparents  had lived ther e as profes s ionals , as well as
 
m y grandpar ents  and s o forth
; 
m
os tly in the fields  of law, m edic ine, bus ines s, and other pr ofessions.  They dis pers ed in that area.  
Some people lived in the north.  Som e people lived in the s outh.  In the turn of the c entury, m y four th 
great par ents  move
d to Budapes t.  So my mother  and I were born in Budapes t, and many other  
s iblings .
  
Mos t of the families  at that tim e, as traditional fam ilies , had many c hildren, nine and 12.  So 
m y gr andpar ents on both s ides  had m any s iblings.
 

3 
 
 
After the em anc ipation of the J ews, 1876, J ewis h c om munities  had thrived.  My par ents  and 
m y family were am ong the m iddle c las s and thos e who were s ec ular .  I didn't have too m any people 
who were ver y r eligious , inc luding m ys elf.
 
 
Dur ing the Fir s t Wor ldWar, both my grandfather s had s er ved with dis tinc tion and m any of 
their siblings s er ved with dis tinc tion in the Aus tro
-
Hungar ian Arm y.  And after the war  was  los t by the 
em pir e, Hungary was  c arved up, m any of my family m em bers  ended up in what is  now Slovakia, 
Rom ania, Ser bia.
 
 
One of the tragic c onsequenc es  of the war was  that a r ather anti
-
Sem itic  government had 
taken over.  The fir s t anti
-
J ewis h law in Europe was  exec uted in Hungary in 1920.  And this  law 
es s entially excluded J ewis h s tudents  from the univer s ities .
 
 
I had an unc le, for example, who was  a third
-
year s tudent in a m edic al s c hool and he was  
beaten up.  He and his  friends  were es s entially kic ked out of the s c hool.  So many of them dec ided to 
leave Hungar y, among them  m y unc le.  He went to Italy.  It took him eight year s  t
o get his  degr ee.  
Then he worked in various  parts  and then eventually c am e back to Hungar y in 1936, 
`
37.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I want to ask you a ques tion about that.  With your  unc le attending medic al sc hool in 
Italy, that was  one of the r eas ons  why your  mother  worked, as  I remem ber.  Explain that to us .
 
> > George Pick :  Yes .  Well, tr adition was  that the m ale brothers would be going to higher educ ation 

and the females  would get what they c alled c omm er c ial educ ation, whic h was  s e
cretary
 
type of work.  
S o my m
other went to work at age 16.  My grandfather was  not a r ic h man.  He was  a c hief engineer 
but he didn't make enough money for his two s ons , the doc tor , and another one who bec ame an 

optic ian
, 
to get higher educ ation
 s
o my m other  had to help out.  So s he went to work.  And eventually, 
as  you mentioned, s he bec am e a s ecr etary, a legal s ec r etar y.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  George, you als o mentioned that you c ame from large, extended families  yet you were 

an only c hild.  Was there any r eas on for that?
 
>>
 
George Pick :  Yes .  The reas on in one wor d or two wor ds , I think , is the 
d
epr es s ion.  I was  born in 
1934.  So people, inc luding all of m y c ous ins , wer e only c hildr en.  People c ould not afford m ore than 
one.  So very quickly thes e large families  s hr unk  dow
n.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It m eant, though, that you still had lots and lots of relatives  at that time.
 
> > George Pick :  I s till.  Yeah.  I have pic tures of m aybe 20 r elatives  gather ing together for  a birthday.  

They and their s pous es c am e and c hildr en.
  
Even in
 
m y m other 's generation, there wer e no mor e than 
two.  In m y generation ther e wer e only one.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  George, while the full br unt of the war would not c om e to Hungar y until 1944, the lives  
of J ews  in Hungar y, inc luding in Budapest, would c hange s ignificantly with the beginning of the war.  

Tell us what you c an about your fam ily and your c ir c um stanc es during those ear ly year s  of the war that 
was  taking plac e r eally els ewher e in Eur ope. 
 
> > George Pick :  Right.  Well, Hungar y was , for a politic al r ea
s on, was  an ally of Germany
 e
ver s inc e 
1937, 
`
38.  The Hungar ians  were a funny ally.  They wer e not r eady for  war at all.  So although the 
Germ ans from 1933 on, the Hitler regim e had s ys temic ally made laws agains t the Jews  whic h r es ulted 
in m as s em igr ation
 
on one hand and 
population
 
on the other  hand.  There was  a large J ewis h 
population ther e, r oughly about 800,000.  They wer e not ready to do too muc h bec aus e the J ewish 

c om m unity was  quite impor tant for s oc iety.  They wer e the ones  who r an the factories and owned the 
fac tor ies  and m any bus ines s es  and s o forth.  So the Hungarians  had their r eas ons  not to be very hars h 
with the J ews .
 
 
Now, in m y family, m y father
 
was  unem ployed during the D epr es s ion and m y gr andfather was  
able to get him a job as an engineer .
  
Unfortunately he was  ther e only for a year  and after whic h he was  
laid off for the s ole reas on that he was  J ewis h.  The fir st anti
-
J ewis h law whic h was  s or t of the offic ial 
anti
-
J ewis h law c ame in 1938
, i
t es s entially s aid that no m or e than 5% of em ployees  c ould be J ewis h.  
And s inc e my father  was  relatively junior then, he was  the first to get r id of.
  
Les s than a year  after this  
ther e was  a s ec ond J ewis h law whic h r es tricted Jewis h em ploym ent
 
or employ ing J ews  or an em ployer 
of Jews.  It restricted them
 
further.  So a lot of people los t their  jobs.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was that the straw m an s ys tem ?
 

4 
 
> > George Pick :  Well, the s tr aw man s ys tem  s tarted then.  But the mor e im portant part was  with the 
s ec ond J ewis h law, they had a par t to it, a s ec ret one
, 
whic h
 
s aid that people who ar e not tr us twor thy, 
inc luding the J ews , the com munists , the s oc ialis ts, they would not be inducted to the Ar my but they 

would be induc ted into what they c alled labor  brigades  but in fac t they wer e s lave labor brigades.  This  
s tarted 
in 1940.  And my father was  am ong the firs t who was  induc ted into one of thes e s lave labor 
br igades.  He was  s ent to what is  now in Uk raine to build roads  with ver y s im ple ins trum ents  like 
pic kaxes  and things like that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Shovels  and pickaxe
s. 

> > George Pick :  Shovels  and pickaxes .  He was  luc ky
, n
umber one, bec aus e the people who wer e 
s upervis ing this gr oup wer e hum ane.  They were Chr is tian, very hum ane.  So thes e people
 
--
 
m y 
father, for example, was  39 year s  old and phys ic ally, relatively,
 
fit.  But I have pic tur es  wher e I c an 
s how you that they wer e overweight, older  people, doctor s, lawyers , etc ., who had to be c arrying heav y 
piec es  of m ater ial and they wer e not r eady to do that.  It is  lucky that nobody got hurt.  The c onditions  
were rather poor. Fortunately m y father  was  deactivated after thr ee months .  
 
 
Now, after this, I was  already enrolled in a J ewis h elem entary s c hool.  This  was  1940.  
Hungar y was  a neutr al countr y until J une
 
1941.  I had this  doctor unc le who was  the only per s on i
n the 
fam ily who c ould for es ee the futur e
 
and despite many people who tried to dis c ourage him, he was  able 
to manage to get to the United States .  So imm ediately after getting here he was  tr ying to get us  out.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I have to have you s ay one thing that I enjoyed when you told me. When your unc le 
dec ided to c ome to the United States , part of the pr oblem  was  that he c hos e the United States.  Tell us  
what your father or  one of the r elatives  s aid.
 
> > George Pick :  His  father , m y grandfather, wr ote 
him a letter  s aying I don't under stand why you want 
to go to the United States, they are gangs ters , Indians  and why would you want to c ome here
.
  
Why 
wouldn't you go to a place like Bulgaria?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  A c iviliz ed plac e like Bulgaria.  [Laughter]
 
>>
 
George Pick :  I have that letter, ac tually.  It's  amus ing.  Anyway, he c ame.  He was  trying to get us  
out.
 
 
Now, the paperwork whic h the Am eric an governm ent put up, es pec ially the quite anti
-
Sem itic  
Depar tment of 
F
or eign 
A
ffairs, made it im pos s ible to get
 
a paper fast.  Although, the number of people 
who would have been by law allowed here, they wer e never allowed her e.
  
So what happened is  we got 
on the waiting lis t.  It s aid in 1943 we would be eligible to com e.  Well, this was  1940.  Ever ybody 

knows  tha
t by 
`
43 the war  was over. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So it was  a thr ee
-
year  wait at that point.
 
> > George Pick :  Three
-
year  wait.  Exac tly.
 
 
So in 1941, in J une, Hungary, up until then whic h was  neutr al, got into the war  when the 
Germ ans invaded the Soviet Union. 
 
And, of c ours e, after  that Hungar y was  one of the belliger ents . 
 
At that point ther e was  a s ituation whic h you probably would like to k now of how the J ews  m ade som e 
m oney.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How you m ade a living.
 
> > George Pick :  Exactly .  So the way they did it was  a s ys tem  whic h was c alled a str aw man s ys tem.  

The s tr aw man s ys tem  is as  follows .  If you had a fr iend who was  a Chr is tian, he or s he c ould take out 
a lic ens e to do bus ines s
 
and under that lic ens e
 
the J ewis h per s on would work as a worker for  th
at 
per s on.  That was  allowed. 
 
That's  what happened in m y father 's c as e.  We have a s uper by the name 
of Dudek
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As in a superintendent? 
 
> > George Pick :  Right.  Right.  Right.  And he was  able
 
--
 
m y father asked him to do it.  And the straw 
m an ess entially gave them  their  nam e and their  lic ens e and in exc hange they would get s om e money, 
s om e s tipend, fr om the per s on who ac tually wor k ed for them.  So my father  did that between 1941 and 
`
44.
 

5 
 
> > Bill
 
Bens on:  
`
44.  And, George, as  you explained 
to us , in, I think
 
` 42
 
Hungary dr ops  its  neutral 
s tatus, joins  the Germ ans .  That c hanged things even more dramatic ally in Hungar y.  You s aid to m e 
up until that time des pite all of thes e things  you des c r ibed it was  r elatively peac eful for  you.
 
> > George Pick :  Corr ec t.  In 1941, the third anti
-
Jewis h law c am e into effec t which was  s imilar to the 
r ac ial law whic h the Germans  pas s ed in 1935, the
 so-
c alled Nuremberg L
aws  whic h was  c haracteriz ing 
the J ews  as  a r ac e
 
r ather  than a r eligion.  And after  that things wer e m uc h wors e.  People were horrors 
and s o forth.
 
 
One inter esting thing what happened is  things were m uc h wor s e in Aus tr ia and in Slovakia, 
Rom ania.  We had relatives , as  I mentioned, becaus e of the c hop
- u
p of Hungar y.  They c am e, a few of 
them c ame, fr om Aus tria, one fr om Dac hau.  He was  ar res ted and s ent to Dac hau.  He was  a r ic h man
.  
He
 
was  able to pay his  way out and he got a vis a to Hungar y.
  
 
 
I had other relatives  who lived in Br atis lava, now the c apital of Slovakia.  They c am e illegally.  
And both of them  were telling us  what had happened to the German J ews  and the Austr ian J ews  and 

the Slovak J ews .  They were taken to c onc entration c am ps.  They wer e depor ted.  They wer e 
ghettoized.  It was  inc r edible, inc r edible for  us.  We wer e liv ing, as  you s aid, r elatively well.  We lived in 
the s ame plac e.  We had went whenever we wanted to.  People wer e talking to us .  It was  no problem.  
And we c ould never  imagine that it would happen in Hungary.
 
 
So thes e people c ame and liter ally our  family was  hiding them.  They had illegal paper s.  They 
s lept ever y day in another  plac e.  They s lept in our  plac e als o.  We wer e ver y ner vous  and c areful but 

we managed to hide about a dozen people
 o
f our family.  But we never  thought that this c ould happen.
 
 
Now, in 1942, the Hungarians  r eluctantly fielded an Arm y, the s ec ond Army
; w
ith that, 50,000 
J ewis h s lave labor er s  as well.  My father was  a year  older than the upper age when they would have 
taken them, induc ted them .  But the number of relatives , unc les  and so forth, they wer e young and they 

were s ent to the Uk r aine.  It was  a tragic  thing.  It was  
the 
first s ign that things are going to go bad.  At 
leas t 50,000 people, m any of them were very, ver y badly treated.  And s o
m e of the s uper vis or s , Army 
people, wer e told that
:  U
ntil the last J ew is  alive y ou ar e going to stay in the Ukr aine
; i
f you get rid of 
the las t J ew, then you c an c om e hom e.  So obvious ly they had a r eas on, quote/unquote, to do all s orts 

of horr ible things.  They s ent them out naked in a m inus 40
-
degree weather  to fr eeze to death.  They 
gave them no food.  They gave them  the m ost danger ous  m is s ions like m ine picking.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To c lear m inefields .
 
> > George Pick :  To c lear m inefields , exac tly.  Out 
of the 50,000 only about 5,000 s ur vived.  Two of my 
unc les  s urvived and three of them did not.
 
 
So this  was  a horr ible thing.  We didn't know, of cours e, about this.  There was  no 
c om m unic ation, you know, the pr opaganda s howed that we wer e winning.  In fact, the whole Ar my was  
wiped out in les s than a week and with it m any of the s lave laborers , by the Rus s ians  in J anuary
 
1943. 
 
Then, my father was  induc ted again.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Des pite his  age.
 
> > George Pick :  Des pite his  age now he was  induc ted but he was  s ent to a labor c am p in what is now 
Transylvania, in Romania.  And, again, he was  luc ky bec aus e the people who had s upervis ed them  
were dec ent people.  They were Chr is tian and they wer e very decent.
  
After thr ee m onths  he c am e 
bac k  hom e.
 
 
Even in 1943,
 
jus t to illus trate how c om par atively fr ee we were, we wer e able to take a 
vac ation.  This  is 
`
43, after  half of the J ewis h people in Europe wer e already gas s ed and cr emated and 
we wer e s till able to take a tr ip.  The only bad thing about that trip was  that we walked ar ound in a nic e 
little for es t and we bumped into thes e Hungarian Nazis .  At that time the Nazis  wer e illegal, r eally, in 

Hungar y.  But the Hungar ian Nazis  still was  a ver y fr ightening thing.  My mother  and I s ort of wer e 
c onc er ned.
 
> > Bill B en

>> G
eorge Pick:  When the Ger mans  c am e.  And then everything c hanged.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about what you rem ember about the arr ival of the Germans and then what 
happened s o quickly in the afterm ath of their  arr iva
l of M
ar c h 1944.
 
> > George Pick :  Yeah.  M
ar c h 1944 was  a Sunday and we were walking bec aus e the Germ an tanks 
were rolling into Budapes t. We didn't know anything what was  happening.  But what did happen was  

that Horthy was  c alled by Hitler to c om e out of Hungar y and dis c us s things  with him .  Horthy, in 1942, 
was  as ked by Hitler to turn over the Hungarian J ews  and he dec lined.  He was  the only one who was  
an ally of Hitler  and dec lined to deport the Jews  at the tim e.  So that's  why we wer e s till m or e or less  
intac t in Mar c h 1944. 
 
So what happened is  he was  out of the c ountry when the Ger mans  occ upied the 
c ountr y.  He was  c ut off c ompletely.
 
 
Now, the Hungarian Army was  always  
pr o
-
Nazi
.  A lot of officers were 
pr o
-
Nazi
.  So not a s hot 
was  fir ed when the bor der  was  c los ed by four or five divis ions  of
 
Germ an s oldier s .
  
What we found 
our s elves  in was  a s ituation whic h is , up until then, unthinkable.  We wer e under an oc c upation in forc e.
 
 
Now, Hor thy c am e back a day later .  He formed a government whic h was  
pro
-
Nazi
.  About five 
or  s ix days  after, m y 10t
h 
bir thday, whic h was Marc h 28, as you m entioned, we were for c ed to wear  the 
yellow s tar s.  That was  the first thing.  And what took  Germany five years  took  roughly a m onth in 
Hungar y to have quote/unquote legis lation, anti
-
Jewis h legis lation, enac ted.  Dozens  of them  a day 
inc luding taking the telephones , the bic ycles , the c ars, all c ommunic ations .  We were c ompletely cut off.  
So we did not know what was  happening in the Provinc es  of Hungar y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So jus t outs ide of Budapest.
 
> > George Pick :  
Outs ide of Budapes t.  It m eant over  a hundr ed of our relatives  were c om pletely cut 
off.  We didn't know anything about them .
 
 
Eic hmann was an infamous  man who had been in c harge of organizing deportations .  Now, he 
c am e in with 120 m en.  
Th
e unfortunate th
ing was  that the 30,000 s trong gendarm e in Hungary

> > Bill Bens on:  That's  the Hungarian polic e for c e.  Right?
 
> > George Pick :  Hungary r ur al polic e for c e.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Rur al.  Ok.
 
> > George Pick :  They were m or e than happy to do things .  So they c ooperated fully with the idea that 

all J ews  would be c onc entr ated into a relatively few lar ger  plac es.  Ever y J ew from little villages  was  
tr ans ported to a bigger  c ity and fr om a bigger c ity to an even bigger  one
 w
hic h were clos e to the 
r ailroad s tations .
  
So in a m onth or s ix weeks , actually, between the 15th of Apr il, less than a m onth 
before the Ger mans  c ame in, until the 7th of J uly, 437,000 J ews  wer e depor ted in 154 tr ains.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Over  a six
-
week period.
 
> > George Pick :  Over  a s ix
-
week period
,  
whic h was  a r ec ord.  The people who wer e looking at this , 
the high
-
up Nazis , c ould not believe this .  And 95% of thes e people wer e s ent to Ausc hwitz
 w
hic h 
tr ans lates  into r oughly 12,000 people a day to Aus c hwitz.
 
 
Now, Aus c hwitz was  a lar ge
-
s c ale death 
c am p and a fairly lar ge
-
s c ale work  c amp as well.  
They c ould not handle that m any people.  90% of thes e people were s elec ted to be gass ed and burned.  
And the c rem atorium worked s o muc h that one of them  blew up.  Over  a hundr ed of m y r elatives  ended 
up in 
the gas c ham bers
a
nd died.
 
 
But we didn't know anything about this . We knew one thing.  We k new that m y father  and 
ever ybody from 16 to 60 were induc ted, all the J ewis h men wer e inducted, into s laver y brigades .  And 
m y father was  s ent to the wes ter n edge of Hungar y.  He was  wor king on fortific ations  bec aus e 
obvious ly the Germ ans figured that Hungary is  going to bec ome a battleground.  He was  ther e. We 

didn't hear muc h about him .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did you even know where he was  s ent?
 
> > George Pick :  No.
 
>>
 
Bill Bens on:  I rem ember you telling me he just pretty muc h dis appear ed.  He was  gone. 
 
> > George Pick :  Yeah.  All the m en from Budapes t and all over Hungar y, m any of them , had 

dis appeared like that. 
 

7 
 
 
So we didn't know what was  going on.  We didn't know
 
anything about the deportations .  The 
one whic h we knew was  we got an order to m ove from our apar tment to what they c alled J ewis h 
houses .  Thes e J ewis h hous es
, as
 
you s howed in one of the pictures, had a big yellow star .  And 
Hungary or  Budapest had about
 
185,000 J ews  at that point, 20% of the people who lived ther e at that 
tim e.  And the J ews  wer e c onc entr ated into 5% of the living s pace. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So 20% of the population in 5% of the living space.
 
> > George Pick :  So what happened is  we had to move bec aus e our  house, our  building, was  not 

qualified as a J ewis h building.  So we m oved in with my gr andm other's s is ters .  And the rule was  that 
four people had to take a r oom.  So this was a two
-
r oom apar tm ent.  You would c all it a one
-
bedr oom  
her e but it was  two r ooms .  So we moved in. We c ould not take any fur nitur e exc ept our  beds  and 

s om e belongings. We had to leave ever ything ther e. 
 
 
This  worked from J une
 
27.  And the way it was  done, it was  r eally mini ghettos.  Eac h building 
had a s upervis or, superintendent, and his  bus ines s
 
--
 
he was  a Christian pers on.  His bus ines s  was  to 
loc k  the door s and for 22 hours every day we were locked in and we had only two hour s  to get out to 
buy food.  And
 
the two hours  were between 2:00
 
and 4:00
 
and by then the f
ood was  gone and m any of 
the m er c hants would refus e to s ell to J ews .  So it was  not an eas y thing to find. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And for thos e that wer e in that s ituation with you, it s ounds  like it was  m os tly wom en, 
c hildren, and the elderly.

Yes .  All of them, all of the above, yes .

this is  May, J une, J uly of 1944.  D

Day oc c urr ed on 
J une
 
6.  Allied bombing began over  Budapes t.
 
> > George Pick :  Right.  O
n
ly a week after  we moved in
, 
ther e was  what they c alled s atur ation bombing
 
r aid of Budapes t.  This  was  J uly
 
2.  What had happened, it was  a thr ee
-
hour bom bing r aid.  We wer e 
extremely luc ky to s ur viv e that bec aus e there were four  bom bs  whic h dropped within a few hundr ed 
yards  of where we lived.  And the whole building was  s haking. We had a bunker .  Ever ybody went 
ther e.  But ever ything, all the elec tr ic ity went out.  It was a terr ible nois e.  Ever  s inc e, even today, I get a 
little bit r attled if I hear a s har p nois e. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I rem ember you telling me that the door fr am es on your  building wer e buckled from the 
heat.
 
> > George Pick :  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr om the bombing.
 
> > George Pick :  Yeah.  The door fr ames in the bunker, they were steel but the s hock wave of the 

bom bing buckled the
m , es s entially.  You c ould see what was  going outs ide.  I got alm ost hys ter ic al.  My 
m other  put a big pillow over m y head.  And for  30
-
odd years  I c ouldn't s leep without a pillow over m y 
head.  Even now I am using ear  plugs to s leep bec aus e I jus t
 
--
 
I get
 
very
 
--
 
not frightened but.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The bombing was  s o intens e that, as  I r ec all, that led to the end of the deportations  for 
a per iod of tim e.
 
> > George Pick :  Yes .  What happened after  this , this  was  a m es s age to Hor thy.  First of all, r emem ber
, 
30% of the c ity laid in r uins .  It was  a mes s age to Hor thy.  Not this .  There were s ever al other 

m es s ages.  Roos evelt sent him one.  The Swedis h king s ent him  one that unles s  the depor tation stops  
this  is  going to c ontinue.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And we'll pul
verize
 
Budapes t.  In s om e histor ians' minds , Hor thy did not know about 
thes e deportations , which, to m e, is  impos s ible.  But they ar e trying to r ewr ite history rec ently.  So this  
was  one of the things .  And as  soon as Horthy found out, he would s top the deportation.  And that was  
J uly
 
7.  And this  was the s ame day when 3,000 of the gendarm es had s hown up being ready for the 
deportations  from Budapes t.  It was n't just the depor tations .  They wanted to over thr ow the region.  And 
ther e was  only one of the m any
 
Hungarian divis ions  who was loyal to Horthy.  And they were able to 
put down this  coup
 a
nd stop the depor tation.  And that, of c ours e, was  a great deal.
 
 
My father's  unit was  brought back  to Budapest.  And a new governm ent c ame in c om pr is ing of 
s enior  gen
erals.  Things  were quieting down.  We did not know this  but thes e things c ame up 
after wards .
  
This  went on until the 15th of October.  And the 15th of Oc tober was  the day when Hor thy 

8 
 
very belatedly dec ided that maybe he needs to do a gesture and he pr oc laim ed Hungary a neutral 
c ountry out of the war. 
 
 
Now, Oc tober  was  about thr ee months after the Romanians  alr eady s witc hed s ides  and 
tr apped a large German Ar my.  And now they wer e fighting with the Rus s ians  agains t the Hungar ians .  
This  c oup or attempted coup ended in two hours .  Hor thy was arres ted and his  fam ily deported to 
Aus tria, ac tually.  And the Nazi Party
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Arrow Cr os s .
 
> > George Pick :  The Ar row Cr os s  took  over.  And the deportations began in 
ea
r nest.  Eic hmann, who 

left Budapest in J uly, c am e back  and the firs t thing was  10,000 younger  women in about s even days  
after  this  failed c oup were round up and deported for  work, s uppos edly.  One of my aunts  was  depor ted 
at that point.  She was  29 years  old.  She died right befor e the 
liberation
, i
n Ravens bruck.  And my 
m other  was  for tunately older than the age they wer e looking for.  They were looking until 40
 a
nd with no 
c hildren.  And m y m other had one.
 
 
So the deportations  s tarted in earnest.  And m y father's  unit at the end of Oc tober was  told 
that they would be s ending them to Ger m any as worker s.  My father was  luc ky again.  He had a
 
c om m ander who was  a dec ent m an.  He had a J ewis h 
fiancÃ©e
 
who lived in our building.  He gave 
ever ybody a 24
-
hour fur lough.  So m y father  had that plan
 
whic h didn't work out.  He went to a friend of 
his  who was  als o known Jewis h, a bus ines s  par tner , and told him, "If I s how up at the railroad station 

tom orr ow mor ning at 7:00, I'll be deported.  Can you do s om ething?"  And he s aid yes .  He gave him  a 
piec
e of paper and s aid to go to this  addr es s , go in and talk  to the c omm anding offic er there.  And this  
addr es s  was  a textile factory of whic h allegedly m ade uniforms for  the Hungar ian Arm y.  So m y father  

went ther e and they let him in.  It turned out that the c ommanding offic er  was  als o a J ewis h guy and 
this  whole plac e was  jus t c amouflaged as a factory.  It was
,  
in fact, a plac e wher e 60 or 70 J ewis h s lave 
labor er s  were able to esc ape wor k.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And pose
d 
as  textile worker s making uniform s .
 
>> Ge
orge Pick :  Right.  Right.  My father had this little paper.  I still have it.  It s hows  that he was  
working ther e in the textile factory.  And this  was  a pr ior ity fac tory with all the s tam ps.  And ther e was  a 

guy in front who was an arm ed Hungar ian s oldier with uniform, arms.  Of cours e, he was  als o
 
a 
defector .  But that's bes ide
 
the point.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  as tonis hing that this  rous e, this  fak e fac tor y, 
if you will, was
 
c r eated.  And ther e 
were s everal other s, right?
 
> > George Pick :  Three others. 
 
Altogether  ther e wer e r oughly 1,100 people.
 
 
Now, we got in there also about a week  after my father did.  They had good intelligenc e.  And 
this  was  a large organization.  And the organization was  m os tly J ewis h but not jus t J ewis h.  Imagine 
feeding a lot of people.  You needed logis tic s.  So many people c ooper ated.  And they had intelligenc e 
als o with the Army
.  
So 
--
 
even ins ide the Arrow Cros s .  
 
 
So they found out that our neighbor hood was  going to be depor ted in the beginning of 
Novem ber.  My father s ent a mess age that we s hould im mediately come and join him .
  
My m other was  

r eluc tant bec aus e m y grandm other and her three s is ter s  lived in the s am e plac e and it was  s tric tly don't 
tell anybody, jus t you and George.  So we went.
  
 
 
Ever ybody's  family, by the tim e we got there, there were about from 70 to 170 people ther e.  
We lived ther e.  It was  a very tric ky s ituation.  Num ber one, this was  a factor y, an alleged fac tor y.  And 
what do s o m any people do? Well, you c ould s ay, well, m en and wom en worked ther e but what do the 
c hildren do
? 
> > Bill Bens on:  Yeah, you don't have kids  running ar ound a fac tor y.
 

> > George Pick :  Exactly .  So it was  very iffy.  We knew that this neighbor hood was  extremely, 
extremely Nazi.  So we wer e ver y s ur e that ther e was  no light after s uns et.  We were living in this  k ind 
of bunk  beds, thr ee at a tim e.  We had some food, as  I mentioned.  They brought food in.  As ide fr om  
the fac t that we wer e having bom bing r aids  twic e a day, it was  ok .
 
 
One of the interesting par ts was , of this s tor y, is  that ther e wer e five very young men, Zionis ts .  
They got uniforms, Nazi unifor m s, and m ac hine guns  and they had fals e paper s  that they c ould go out 

9 
 
to the depor tation tr ains  and pick off people s aying we have an or der to arr es t this per s on and we
 w
ill 
br ing them  to the Nazi headquar ters .  And, of c ours e, that per s on was  us ually a young woman or  a 
young man and they br ought them back  into hiding.  Roughly 20 people s aved like that. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  George, at s om e point, though, you would be r aided, denounc ed and r aided. What 

happened then?
 
> > George Pick :  Well, we were denounc ed.  I found out this long after the war
 
--
 
long after I left.  We 
were denounced and the leader  of the gr oup who was  with us  at that time was  denounc ed.  So they 
r aided th
r ee of the four plac es , the Hungar ian
 
Ges tapo did.  When they c am e in with mac hine guns and 
s or ted the women and children on one end and the men on the other, we thought it was  going to end 

up in a bloodbath.  This  was  Dec em ber
 
2.  I remem ber the date very
 
well.  
 
 
And this  par tic ular group, they wer e not s tupid.  The Rus s ians wer e 20
 
m iles  away.  It was just 
a m atter of maybe a week  or two befor e the Rus s ians  would c om pletely enc ir c le the c ity and there 

would be a s iege.
  
So we had fortunately people who had m oney and they wer e able to bribe these 
people.  So after half an hour of negotiations  they told us that we no longer  under  their  c ar e and 

pr otection. 
 
 
The little c ommittee who was  running our  loc al hideout dec ided that the 22 c hildr en who wer e 
in this
 
plac e would be s afer if they wer e s ent to an or phanage, Swis s  Red Cr os s orphanage.  The 
people were not happy with that.  They were very
 
--
 
ther e wer e very little babies  ther e, 6 months old.  
And ther e was  one woman who was  a mother  and s he s aid
:  W
ell, I
 
want to go with my baby.  Ok , fine.  
 
 
I was  one of the older ones .  So we wer e taken to a Red Cros s building in the middle of the 
c ity.  This  hiding plac e was  s ort of out on the outskirts .  When we got ther e, there were 500 kids.  They 

were dir ty and cr ying and hungr y.  Very few adults .  We look ed ar ound.  I had a fr iend who was  m y age 
and we dec ided to es c ape the next m or ning.  And we did. 
 

 
The building was locked. When the worker s c ame in, in the m or ning, we as ked the woman to 
take us out bec aus e we wanted to buy food for  our s elves .  She took  us out and we r an away. 
 
We went 
bac k .  It was  a r ather high r isk  s ituation.  Of c our se we didn't wear  the yellow s tar.  But they had Nazi 
patr ols  all over the s tr eet.  They wer e pic king people up.  It was  a four
-
hour trip befor e we finally got 
bac k  to wher e we c am e from, the hiding plac e.  Unfortunately a week  later most of thos e c hildren were 
taken tots  Danube and shot, s hot into the Danube. 
 
 
So we es c aped that.  About 10 days  later, 10, 12 days  later, two polic em en s howed up and 
told us  that they opened the ghetto at the end of Novem ber.  And the Gestapo m an s aid that we would 
be better off being in the ghetto than in her e bec aus e s om e of the extr eme Nazis  wer e about r eady to 
m as s acre us.
  
So ever ybody left.  T
he two polic em en gave us
 
--
 
a hundred and s o people s ort of 
dis appeared.  The polic e didn't s ay anything.  They looked away.  
 
 
65 of us  ar rived in the ghetto.  My father  and my mother  dec ided that there is  no way to hide 
any wher e.  So we got into the ghetto. We got hous ed in a plac e whic h als o hous ed an old age hom e, a 
J ewis h old age hom e.  So ther e was  a lot of old people there, and s ick . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  George, now that you're in the ghetto
 
--
 
this  is  Dec em ber
 
1944
.  I
t's winter
.  I
t's  c old.  
As  you said, the Rus s ians  ar e about to enc irc le the c ity and the s iege of Budapes t would begin.  In the 

tim e we have left, tell us what it was  like for you in the s iege of Budapest and then your liber ation.
 
> > George Pick :  Y es .  Well, the s iege of
 
Budapes t started on Chr istm as Day, Dec ember
 
24, 1944.  
Until then m any people wer e depor ted s till.  But thos e in the ghetto were relatively s afe.
 
 
Now, in the ghetto ther e wer e plac es where food was  available.  The problem was  when the 
s iege began, they had shar pshooters
 
ever ywher e.  They had als o people who were s hooting into the 
ghetto
, n
ot just from  the tops
 
but 
e
very wher e
 a
nd then
, 
of c ours e, bombing.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Ar tiller y.
 
> > George Pick :  Exactly .  So what happened is  ver y few people were willing to volunteer t
o get the 
food.  So we were s tar ving.  And not s o s lowly people, four , five people a day died of starvation.
 
 
When ther e was  a lull in the fighting
 
--
 
our building was  next to the c entr al s quar e of the 
ghetto.  They took  the c or ps es  out and thr ew them into
 
a hill of c or ps es , m aybe 3,000, 4,000 people 
alr eady dead.  The winter  was  ver y, very c old s o the c orps es  alm os t ins tantly bec am e piec es of ic e.  

10
 
 
They fr oze.  And that was  pr obably lucky bec ause we didn't have Typhus  alr eady.  But what we had 
was  lice becaus e now ev erybody lived in a bunker.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And the bunker  was  es s entially a dirt plac e at the bottom of a building.
 
> > George Pick :  Right.  It was  an old building. We had dirt floors.  And that was  als o fairly luc ky for us 
bec aus e we had to h
ave s omewher e to go to the bathr oom s o we had a latrine in the m iddle of this  
plac e
.  B
ut it was  very clos e to wher e we were
 
--
 
the r oom was  les s  than this  and we have 200 people 
ther e.  So we wer e s ide
-
by
-
s ide.  It was s tinky.  Ther e was  no water  no elec t
r ic ity.  We wer e s itting 
ther e and s lowly s tar ving to death.
  
I didn't have too many young people ther e.  I had a couple people I 
was  talking to and playing with and s o forth.
 
 
And then on the 4th of Januar y, there was  a gr oup of people, younger people, who wer e 
br ought in.  Then we found out that theWallenberg project, whic h was  to s ave J ews  in Swedish 

houses , they decided that 10,000 people would be s afer in the big ghetto than in that s o
-
c alled 
pr otected hous es . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So they br ought in another  10,000 people.
 
> > George Pick :  They br ought in another  10,000 people out of whom  we had probably another 50.  So 

that's  when we found out about this. 
 
 
There were people who s urvived year s  of war in the Ukraine and they were not about to die 
jus t a fe
w days  before liber ation.  So nobody volunteered.  People jus t died.
  
My m other  lost and my 
father los t a lot of weight. 
 
So when the Rus s ians  c am e, whic h was  in J anuar y
 
1945, we wer e skin and 
bones , ever ybody who was  alive was  skin and bones .  There was  a
 
str ange quiet there.  Then we 
looked up in a s lit window up there and we s aw jus t s hoes  and they were not German s hoes  but they 
were Rus s ian boots .  So we knew that something happened. 
 
 
We wer e not c elebr ating.  Ever ybody was  jus t looking ar ound and tr ying to figure out what to 
do.  My father  dec ided around noon time that we s hould go back  to the plac e where we wer e thrown 

out fr om, in the pr ior  J une.  We went thr ough the c ity whic h was  under  s iege and you c ould s ee the 
dem olis hed buildings , people dying, hor s es  of s om e Rus s ian s oldier s.  And by then the s iege
 
of the 
Pes t
 
par t was  liberated.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Budapes t was  divided into two places .
 
> > George Pick :  Right.  And bridges  in between over  the Danube, of c ours e.  All the br idges  wer e 
blown up. 
 
It took us  about three hour s to get hom e, through the rubble and the dead bodies and s o 
forth.
  
When we got home, Mr .
 
Dudek, the s uperintendent was ver y happy .  Mos t people wer e not.  
They thought they wer e s eeing ghos ts.  We look ed like ghos ts.  But a num ber of s ympathizer s
 
were 
worr ied we would point them  out to the Russ ians . We did not.  But at that point, you would jus t point at 
s om ebody and there was  no tr ial; the Rus s ian would just s hoot them.  That was  
the 
las t thing on our 
m inds .
 
 
My gr andmother came bac k .  My gr andpar ents sur vived als o.  But m ost of m y family didn't.  
So that's how it happened. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  George, there's s o m uc h m ore for you to tell us but we'r e at the end of our tim e.  I did 

want to ask  you, though, if would s hare with us
 
--
 
we s aw s ome just wonderful photogr aphs of you as  a 
c hild.  How wer e you able to hang on to thos e photogr aphs thr ough all of that? 
 
> > George Pick :  Well, that's an inter esting stor y.  My mother valued thos e photogr aphs above anything 
els e.  She found that you c an r eplac e jewelry, you c an replac e c lothing but the thing whic h you c annot 
r eplac e are pic tur es .  So we had a little s uitc as e whic h I eventually c arr ied fr om the ghetto back home 
full of photographs .  Thos e photographs you s aw were part of that.
 
>
>  Bill Bens on:  So every where you went.
 
> > George Pick :  Ever y wher e we went, in hiding, in the ghetto.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were the guar dian.
 
> > George Pick :  I was  the guar dian for the fam ily memories.  I think  that s he was  r ight.  I think that 
thes e pictures ar e pr ic eles s  and irr eplac eable.  I gave m os t of it to the m us eum c ollec tion, of c our se. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  George, of c our s e, if I remem ber r ight, you then
 
--
 
your  fam ily tried to get out after the 
war.  And, of c our s e, you r an into quota is s ues  agai

> > George Pick :  Exac tly .
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was ther e a 10
-
year  wait at that point? 
 
> > George Pick :  At that point there was  a 10
-
year  wait but
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was n't going to happen anyway .
 
> > George Pick :  It was n't going to happen bec aus e the Communis ts took  over the c ountr y and s o we 
were bac k  into another totalitar ian r egime.  
 
 
I went to a gymnas ium or high sc hool, finis hed in 
`
52.  And des pite of all expec tations  that I 
and m y c las sm ates would not be allowed to the univer s ity bec aus e it was
 
a Jewis h high s c hool we 
were and I was  able to finis h m y m echanic al engineer ing degree jus t a m onth or  s o befor e 1956 
r evolution at whic h time I was  fighting agains t the Rus s ians .  That was  the only r evolution in the whole 
Com munis t wor ld.  Not s inc e and after was  ther e an armed upris ing agains t this .  And, of c ours e, after  

that I and many other  people would not want to stay.  In fac t, 200,000 Hungarians  am ong them about 
20,000 Jews
 
left.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you had to esc ape.  You did not jus t ask  perm is
s ion.
 
> > George Pick :  No, no.  I didn't ask per mis s ion.  No, I walked and a c ouple of friends walked about 
three days  on the fr ozen ground and we were able to go acros s.  Now, it was  a ver y r is ky bus iness  
bec aus e in the Soviet empire, at the ends, at the 
parts  where the empire ended and the fr ee wor ld 
began, there were m inefields  and watc h towers .  Fortunately 
- -  
we didn't k now that but the watc h tower  
per s onnel als o defected jus t the night before.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That gave you your  opportunity.  The guar
ds left.
 
> > George Pick :  We didn't know whether  we were going to be s hot from behind or not but we took  the 

c hance
, a
nother c hance. 
 
 
The ironic  thing was  when we looked back, when we went over
 
--
 
went over to the Austrian 
bor der and looked back and looked for the Hungar ian flag, we didn't s ee one.  It was  a Rus s ian flag.  

That was  my las t m emory of Hungar y.  It is a long s tor y, of c ours e, how we went thr ough thes e three 
days .  But in thr ee week s  I
 
was  here.  My uncle then c ould help us a great deal.
  
So 
Dec ember
 
19, 
1956, I was  her e.  So the next year
 
--
 
59 this  year .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I wis h we c ould keep you, and all of you, for  the afternoon to hear the many details  and 

other things  that we were not able to hear.  Thank  you very muc h, George, for that.
 
 
I'm going to tur n back  to George in jus t a mom ent to c los e our pr ogram  bec aus e it's  our

Thanks for  being here.  And, George? 
 
> > George Pick :  Thank you.  Well, I would like to r ead this  bec aus e in the pas t I had s tated that we 

s hould be toler ant of each other  and res pec t eac h other as a r eligions , c ulture, and ethnic  differ ences  
and for  year s  this  was  my ans wer  or  my final c omment but now I feel that in the light of what is  
happening now in the wor ld, I s ay toler anc e is  not enough.  We mus t be proac tive and vigorous ly fight 
agains t anti
-
Semitism and other types  of hatr ed that is  s pr eading worldwide.  In many plac es this  hatred 
has  turned into violence, mas s acr es , c ivil war s , and genoc ide.  Thes e are unac c eptable.  
T
hey mus t be 
fought with ever y m
eans available.

That I would like to be the las t m es s age
 
I would like you to abs or b bec ause it is not enough 
now to just be pas sive.  We have to be ac tive.  The wor ld is  turning r eally bad and you know that, too. 
 
Thank  you ver y m uc h for lis tening.
