, an d they used  to have
 to write a letter to 
Marshal Pétain
. And Œ and th en 
he used to  send th-the kids a picture on 
a white horse. And also the Œ the letter was 
to go to 
Marshal Pétain
 was also Œ in secrets, they 
used to know how many kids go 
to school, what their names was, and ever
ything. It was like Œ like a giveaway. So Œ 
so everybody wrote a letter and I wrote a 
letter too, but I never got an answer, 
because the principal must 
have torn up my letter, because he was Œ Mademoiselle
 
Milan
(ph) had a Œ used to know him very good
, and she mu st have told him, don™t 
send a letter from the kid to 
Marshal Pétain
, because, you know, it™s gonna be a 
giveaway . So wa Œ I never got a picture from 
Marshal Pétain
. And as a kid I felt Œ 
I felt bad, so the prin cipal gave me an extra letter he had, and it Œ it was a Œ was a 
picture wh ere it had on the Œ on the Œ 
Marshal Pétain
 on the white horse. When

 then, a little bit later is Œ 
Cossionair

 the French army, and he was a 
prisoner in 
Germany
, and the German govern ment released a lot of Œ a lot of 
French prisoners, all the offi

 he came back and we had

And wh en we picked  him 
up, he came with other prisoners, but their un

 up, they only had 
one unifo rm. And when they were in camp  in 
Germany
, they wore that uniform. So 
when  he came home, his to Œ his uniform was all torn up. And I rememb er that, that 
we picked  him up and we brought him back 
home. At home he took off his uniform 
and he wo re regular clothes,
 and he could play piano. 
On  the weekend he played

with the Œ the Œ the Œ the bi

 for Œ in the summer, he 
had no school. He was Œ he wa

couple weeks later, a k id came from Œ he 
was a son of a French officer, a navy

I got friendly with him, and he saw that I 
have friction with 
Bernard
. So he said, well Œ well, wh

say, he wants to be the boss. He said, 
leave him up to me, you know. Because there 
was a Œ a girl came from 
Paris

the kid from the Fren

Bernard
 got mad at

Bernard

Bernard
 became like a Œ like a lamb, he didn™t

week, you know, we used to 
get the shower. And the rest of the week

father used to write to me letters. It

 So I used to get those letters 
from him, and th en Œ and Œ an

she joined my
 father in 
Tresse
, and I was then Œ I was Œ they brought me back to Œ

thought I was her son after a while. 
She™s a Œ knit things for me, sweaters and ev

Marseilles
 to pick me up with 
Lucie

couldn™t Œ I had forgotten the Jewish Œ

to Yiddish, to speak, becau
se my mother didn™t speak
 Flemish, she spoke only 
Yiddish. I spoke Flemish because 
I learned Flemish as a kid in 
Belgiu m
 in school. 
So Œ so I came Œ I came to 
Tresse
, and in 
Tresse
 Œ I Œ I went to school in 
Tresse
. 
And I had to Œ I Œ my  Mademo iselle 
Milan
(ph), they spoke of Œ her Œ th-they had a 
Parisian accent in their French

Parisian accent, the kids 
used to make fun of me like I™m a Parisian. 
So it took me months to get back to Œ to 
get Œ to get back the 
accent of Œ to get the 
Marseilles
 accent, you know, like the 
kids in school. And then I was part of th
e kids in school, you know, the Œ the French

Tresse 
I stayed, since I 
came back from 
Madame 
Milan
(ph), maybe four or five months, and th en the

Marianna
(ph). And up there was a ni

used to go to  the b
each to swim. But we had no fo
od, it was hu Œ we were hungry. 
And at the beach, we used to
 wait for Œ French couples 
used to come on the beach, 
and they  used to have melon. And when  th
ey li Œ left the plac

the blanket and ev erything, they  left th
e melon, you know, cu
t, the melon. And 
when they cut the mel
on, they just cut the top, and 
there was like melon left. So we 
used to take that and eat that. That was Œ 
that was a Œ a big thing to us to grab  the 
melon from the people when they 
le Œ when they left. And in 
Sa n Ra pha el
, we Œ 
we used to go to  school, we had to marc
h to school, maybe about four miles every 
day to school. We had to march in Œ in step
s. If you didn™t march in steps, the Œ the 
cadres
(ph) who used  to wa-watch you, they  
used to hit you, you know? On e day I 
had the fight with one of the 
cadres
(ph). Because I wasn™t in step, he got mad at me 
and we had a big fight. And another 
cadre
(ph) came and he fou Œ he helped  him hit 
me, you know, like Œ had like a big fight with
 him. And in  school, we used to eat 
lunch in school, we used to br
 Œ they used to give us a sa
ndwich in school, used to Œ 
used to take with us a sandwich. And in school there was the kids who came from 

the farms, and th ey had big sandwiches. So 
we used to give them marbles sometime 
and they  used to give us a sandwich, be
cause they were not 
hungry, the kids from 
the farms. So I used  to have a kid who used
 to give me his sandwich. And I used to 
give him marbles, different things, bells. And then finally one day he came to 

school, he wouldn™t give us
 his sandwich. Cause the sandw
ich, I used to split it with 
my other buddies from the 
Œ from the Œ from the Villa 
Marianna
(ph). So Œ so  he 
[indecipherable]
 I say, why didn Œ why didn™t you 
give us sandwich? He said, my

22
mo ther says I shouldn™t give to m Œ th
e sandwich to strange kids, because you 
people are not French, she say, you know, 
like he was a little ra
cist. So Œ so, when 
he threw aw ay the sandwich , I got him, and it was like a big barrel in the yard , and I 
Œ I pushed his head in
 the barrel, you know, in order to
 get the sandwich. So he told 
his mo ther that I roughed him up, because 
we took the sandwich from him. So the 
mo ther came to school. In those days ther
e was no gasoline, they had horses, and 
the mother had a nice carriage with a horse
 like a racing horse, and she had a wh ip, 
an umbrella, and she had her Œ her father
 on the carriage too. But the father was 
senile, he was very old. He was on the hors
e too. And she went to the principal, and 
sh-she argued with the principal that 
we beat him up, the kids from the Villa 
Marianna
(ph) beat him up. So  I had to go 
to see the principal. So the Œ the 
principal said to me, what™s the matter?
 How come you hit hi
m beca Œ and took his 
sandwich? So I said no, he gave us his sand
wich, then  he didn™t want to give us his 
sandwich no mo re. So we Œ we were hungry,
 so we took the san Œ so the prin cipal 

explained to the mo ther that the kids in Œ 
in the Œ in the home, they don™t have too 
mu ch food, so they dependen
t on that sandwich. And he Œ 
he gave a Œ he gave them 
the sandwich and then he stopped giving 
us the sandwich. So  the principal made 
before that, all that stuff happened, he 
made conversation with me, and he was in 
the second World War in 
Belgium
 as a soldier, a French so
ldier. And he was very 

 
Interview with Andre Za lc

friendly with me because h-he knew 
Belgium
. So he explained to the mo ther that 
she gotta speak to the son, 
it™s not Œ they™re not malicious
 kids, they™re like hungry, 
you know? So the mo th er changed Œ ch ange
d, and she told the 
kid to give us a 
sandwich. So, since that time, we used to 
get a sandwich from the kid. It was a big, 
big country bread. Th-T he French used to 
make bread, ro und bread like that, like 
the Italian country bread, y™know? And the m 
Œ he used to give us a sandwich, and 
ri Œ in the beginning we didn™t want to ta
ke a sandwich, we didn™t want no trouble 
with him. He said, no, no, no, the pr
incipal knows about it, you can take the 
sandwich and have your sand
wich. My mo ther said I should give you th e sandwich. 
So there was a Œ a success 
there with the sandwich, you
 know, in that school. And 
then a Œ and then a Œ at Œ I 
stayed there maybe another month, and then I went back 
to 
Tresse
, to my Œ to my father 
and my  mo th er. And Œ and I used  to Œ I used  to go 
see my fath er in the mounta
ins, you know, wh ere he us
ed to cut the woods? And 
that became like the Œ the resistan ce. It b
ecame like a stronghold 
of the resistance. 
And then  one day Œ my  mo ther used to gi
ve me food to bring to my father, you 
know, like food that she ma
de that he liked. And I w Œ I was on th e way to leave 
town to go to the mo
untains, a German patrol were
 in town, German troops. And 
the patrol, they went with me for awh
ile, you know, and th ey ask me where I™m 
going. I said to, you know, my  grandmother, I™m going to see my  grandmother. So,

th-they walked a little bit with me. Maybe 
somebody squealed that I™m going to see 
my father. So Œ so the Œ th
e German patrol, the German 
officer heard like noise in 
the bushes, because there was a lot of lizards
 there and even snakes. So he says in 
German, I understood what
 he said, he says 
[speaks German here]
. Let™s Œ let™s go 
back. Let™s not go with them
, because it™s dangerous areas, like a jungle, he said. 
[speaks German] 
It means it™s like a jungle. So he 
Œ th-the German patrol stayed in 
town, they ac Œ they 
walked a little bit with
 me, maybe 200 meters, and then they 
went back. So I went by myself up to 
the mountain. It was a big climb, was like 
maybe four or five hours until I got up th
ere. And at that time, they derailed a 
German train. And when they derailed the 
German train , there were sardines, they 
captured a lot of sardines and we
ap ons. There was trains going to  
Italy
 that they 
derailed. And th ere were Œ there were Œ 
the train had sardines and sweet milk, 
because the German wome
n who used to go to 
Italy
 to  meet their husbands, who 
were in the German army, used to have sw
eet milk for their babies. And when they 
derailed the train, the French resistance 
captured a lot of sard
ines and the sweet 
milk. So up there I used to eat bread with
 sweet milk and sardines. And then my 
father gave me some sardines
 in a jar, in a jar, sardines
, because he didn™t want me 
to bring the cans in to
wn, then th Œ th Œ if
 they find the cans,
 they will know that 
they derailed the train. So he says, and 
when you™re finished eating the sardines, 

 
Interview with Andre Za lc

you bury the jar. So I did that, I buried 
the jar. But I didn™t bury the jar deep 
enough, so the next week, German troops
 came and they surro
unded the town, and 
they made Œ they to ok us all on the 
Place de la Gare
 in the town, a
nd th ey used to 
search the houses for the Œ search the houses for weapons, becaus
e they know in the 
town there™s resistance who 
derailed the train. So th Œ 
so I buried th at Œ the jar on 
the Œ on my  landlady™s yard, next to us wh
ere we lived. And he used Œ he went with 
the dog on the yard, and the dog
 smelled the sardines, so th
e dog was barking. So he 
didn™t want to dig up th e yard, you know, th
e sardine there, so 
he says to the dog, 
du verrückt hund
. It means, you crazy dog, why are you smelling here? 
[indecipherable]
 and he kicked the dog. And Œ a
nd the dog cried a little bit, and he 
l Œ he left with the dog. But if he would every 
undug
 that place, he would have find 
the jar from the sardine, and that could ha
ve been dangerous. So
 the Germans, all 
day they  kept the people prisoner, and they  
searched the houses, but they didn™t find 

nothing, so they left, 
they left. And then Œ 
and then we st Œ in 
the town we ast Œ we 
Œ we stayed under the German occupation.
 And th ey came Œ they didn™t come all 
the time, th e German, they came once in 
awhile, and they Œ but a lot of Germans 
went thro ugh to wn  to go to  
Italy
, the German convoy

Italy
 to fight

San Tropez
, and 
they Œ and they came 
up towards Œ towards 
Tresse
, but they stayed  on th e national

Tresse 
was liberated by the resi

[indecipherable]
 papers 
[indecipherable]
 you called, that the people shou
ld go to  the mo untains, should go 
to the mountains becau
se the town is gonna have Œ can
 be fighting in the town. So 
the entire population went to the mountains
, the civilian population. But the people 
went to the mountain, they 
had fo od with th em. And then  we went too, my  mo th er, 
my two sisters, my fat h er was in the mountain, he didn™t 
go with us. So we went to 
the mountains. So we stayed there about two days, and 
we had no more food, so my 
mo ther says, take the wheel carriage from 
your sister, you know, the carriage, and 
go to  town an-and get us Œ bring so me food
. In the Œ in the cl

until Œ until the liberation, you know. So I got to town, 
and as I got to town  with a friend of mine, 
a kid, he came with me, the town was all 
empty. It was like a no man Œ like a Œ like you see from the Œ in th e town  of th e 
cowboys where everybody

and we got to the house and 
we loaded the wagon 
with the food, the melons and the Œ and the beans, and as we 
want to go get out of the h

 They ripped  the doors open and th ey 
take out the drink and they
 put the table outside and 
they  start drinking, the 
Germans, you know? And they  were the Germ
ans who were supposed to protect the 
town , maybe about 30 Germans with Œ had 
Œ with the machine guns, the Œ all, you

 friend say, wh at we gonna do now? We 
can™t get out. He said, we stay here until 
night time, at night time, we™ll get out of 
the town at night time. So we
 stayed there until it got dark
. And as I walked out, the 
Œ the carriage made noise, because there was 
no oil. It made eh, 
eh, eh. So Œ so he 
says, what are we gonna do, it makes too mu
ch noise. So we Œ 
we picked up the 
carriage and we dragged it a little bit, but
 then we let it down again, and it made 
noise. The Germans heard the noise, they
 came running with the machine guns in 
the dark. We saw them. As kids, you can see 
good at night. So Œ 
so w-we walked up 
the hill, we had to Œ from the fountain,
 we had to walk the hill towards the 
mountain. So we saw the German pointing at 
us, and he Œ he starts shooting. So we 
left the carriage go. The carriage went agai
nst a tree, th Œ and broke and the melon 
starts rolling. So  the German starts shoot
ing at the melons, he didn™t know what it 
was. He starts shooting at the melo n, an
d we escaped, you know, we got up in  the
