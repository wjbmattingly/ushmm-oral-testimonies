ICEK BAUM 
July 5, 1994 
 
 
01:00:40 
 
Q: I need to begin by having you state your name  as it was then, the date of birth and where 
you were born.  
 
A: My name  is Icek Baum. I'm born in Wa rsaw the first of January, 1925. And this 
neighborhood where I was born in Warsaw, it called Powisle, this was just on the river 
but Poland the big river is Vistula, ma ybe you know, and that neighborhood was called 
like that. And my father was a tailor for the army, and so far my father was not alive. He 

was not bad but he died. I was very young. I don't reme mber. It could be 1934, '33, '34, 
some thing like that. And my mother she was with seven kids. It was very, very hard. So 
that's the beginning of a very, very hard life for all of us. I was very young at this time, 

maybe ten-years-old, maybe younger. Maybe a little bit younger.  
 
Q: Were you the mi ddle child, older brothers and sisters?   
 
A: Yes. I have older brothers. I was the second youngster, so I have three sisters, it was three 
sisters and four brothers. So I was the more youngster, the second youngster.  
 
Q: Now, your life was difficult because your mother had so ma ny of you to take care of, but 
perhaps you have good me mories before the war?   
 
A: Good memories, yes, good memories, little bit, yes. And time when my mother couldn't 
support everything and I was -- it was time to go to school and first time I was in Polish 
school. In this neighborhood there was no Jewish school and Polish and I was there but I 
was ma ybe lucky, ma ybe my mother was lucky. She sent me  to Dr. Korczak
1
. I was in 
orphanage by Korczak. Maybe you know about Korczak, some thing like that.  
 
Q: Now, let me just hear a little bit more about your lifestyle first, and then I do want to talk 
more about Dr. Korczak. You went to a public school?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And ma ny of your friends and neighbors were Christian?   
 
A: Most of them was Christian, yes. Perhaps some  Jewish too, but just in this neighborhood 
where we were living there was not ma ny Jews, was most Christians. And we was living 
-- like I can remember -- it was good because even I don't know what different between 
Christian or not Christian so. I remember just once when it was holidays, Passover, so we

had change and we give them ma tzos, and they bake beautiful nice cake. And this was 
the difference between a Jew and non-Jew and that's it.  
 
Q: So you had a good relations?   
 
A: We  had a very good relationship, yes. And I think my father, my mother, she have too 
good relationship with these peoples.  
 
Q: Did you do anything that was very uniquely Jewish, other than the holidays?   
 
A: Yes, because we went before to go to the public school my parents would send me , send -
- us, brothers too, in the Jewish cheder
2
. Maybe you know. This is most religion school. 
So that's the one that was really different between the Christians.  
 
Q: So your parents were fairly religious?   
 
A: Not very religious, but like maybe more than in this time. But my father keep always the 
Sabbath and my mother she prepare always for the Friday, like a Jewish home.  
 
Q: Did you experience or were you aware of any antisemitism before Hitler came to power 
or before the war?   
 
A: Yes, lot. Yes. This would be after my father die, so you know when we becomi ng older 
already say we understood more and even on the street ﬁJew, Jew.ﬂ It was always the 
young people, they beating us and they ma ke all kinds of stories, all kinds of things, 
because we was Jews. I didn't see any difference, but ma ybe they saw the difference 

between Jew and non-Jew.  
 
Q: By these were the same  people that you were friendly with?   
 
A: Yes. But when they are comi ng older maybe they was more antisemitic Œ that™s one of 
the reasons. Maybe the parents teach them like that. Maybe when in the churches, when 
they go to the churches the priest say, ﬁDon't buy by Jew. Don™t–. Kill the Jews. 
Because they killed our Jesus Christus.ﬂ That's it.  
 
Q: So this was at a time when Hitler had come to power in Germany but before the war?  
 
A: That's when all before the war -- far before the war. This one, like I say, it was between 
1930, '35, ™34, ™33, ™34, ™35.  
 
Q: And these were the same  people that you said a few mi nutes ago you went to school 
with?

A: Yeah, we went to school. But even in the school when we went the first time and I was in 
the public school, so it was always that the -- but in Poland the people were very religious 
and when it™s comi ng the time to religion -- we don't have to --  but I went out, out from 
the classroom, and so after ﬁJew, Jew, Jew,ﬂ and if they couldn't, they beat us because 

look, we was just couple youngsters. Not so ma ny like them. We  are scared from them 
and they take advantage of us, that's it. It was very, very hard this time. So even like 
youngster, and believe me  I don't know, I couldn't understand why, why?  Because I'm 

Jew?  And I don't see no difference because I was the same  thing. We  don't have no horn. 
We  don't have nothing. We  took the same  language. We  eat the same thing. And they was 
so -- they kill. If they can't  kill, they beat us. They make all kind of trouble. Sometimes, 

we saw, they break the windows. They break all these things. Why?  Because they were -- 
they'r e Jewish family, and believe me at this time we were very, very poor. I remember 
mi ne house. When my father died we were very, very poor because we had my mother. 

She was with seven kids and support seven kids wasn't  easy. She have a very, very, very 
hard life. Very hard life.  
 
01:08:50 
 
Q: What did you know about what was happeni ng in Germany before you were invaded?   
 
A: Lots of things. I don't know. The truth, just what we read some times in the paper, you 
know. The Nationalsozialistische Partei
3
, they win, you know. At this time it was 
Hindenburg
4
 -- Hindenburg lose the power and the German took the power. So when the 
-- 1939 -- just when it was Rosh Hashanah is decreed the war was starting. So the 

Germans start to come into Poland. I remember when the Pole -- I never want to believe 
that the Poland going to lose the war. But at this time I was very young so maybe I don't 

understood very well, but I reme mber once my mother told me  Œ she told us, ﬁYou know 
what, you™ll see, when the Germans come in here, I don't think they are going to handle 
with us very badly because they not the antisemites like the Polacks. Because,ﬂ she say, 

ﬁI reme mber in the war in 1914-18  they were very friendly, because we Jews are 
speaking Jewish
5
, and the Jewish is a lot like German so we could understood 
altogether.ﬂ And it wasn™t -- was like she was saying. 
 
01:10:13 
 
Q: So, you all knew what was happening in Germany but you thought that it wouldn't 
happen to you in Poland?   
 
A: What happen German, I don't know exactly. Because ma ybe I know what we read in the

papers, but, you know, we couldn't have no radi
os, no TV™s and the me dia was not strong 
like today. So we don't know exactly everything. But one thing I reme mber is when 
Hitler is comi ng on power, they send out most the Jews from Germany. And the Jews, 
they come  into Poland and lots comi ng to Wa rsaw and we was talking with them and 

they tell us what kind of pogrom was there, you know, with the Kristallnacht and the 
beating and the -- don't let live the Jews. The Jews have no right, the Jews was second, 
even not the second citizen. They couldn't work. They couldn't have absolute nothing. So 

we know already there is trouble.  
 
Q: Do you reme mber the first day of the war or when Poland was occupied, do you 
reme mber what was happening?   
 
A: When the -- first of all, the Polish people, the Polack, they keep the fight one month, 30 
days. And this was a very, very badly because we was in Wa rsaw and I reme mber it was 
when shrapnel -- you know what the shrapnel -- it was ma ybe two, three windows away 
from our apartment. So in the house if you run down, all my mother she prepare for 

everybody, pullover, you know, some thing to put on clothes. So we run to the shelters. 
So after ma ybe one or two hours later we go out. We  went back to the apartment and we 
eat what we have. We  don't have much but we eat everything. And just the second day, I 

think, they started again and it was fire bombs that fell in the house where we was living 
and everything was burned. And we don't have
 time to take nothing, nothing, we run out 
just what we have on our back. And everybody -- all these houses, all of Wa rsaw was 
burning. So we have nowhere to go. That's what I reme mber and it was on the same  street 
it was a bath -- public bath. So we went there. We have a little. We took a little broom 
and my mother she was living, sleeping in the bath tub. That's what I remember. And 

when the Germans come  in, the first thing what they do they start to give food for the 
peoples, soup and bread. So it was not bad. But after they doesn™t Œ they start with the 
Jews. No Jew have right to have bread. No Jew have nothing. And some times my mother 

-- she was blond, she wasn't  very dark and so it was not so easy to recognize her like a 
Jew, so she went and have bread. But some times, next day or two days later when she go 
again, some Polack recognize her and they say, ﬁAh there™s a Jew, there is a Jew.ﬂ And 

they throw her out so we didn't have nothing.  
 
Q: So this was in the bath house?   
 
A: That was in the bath house.  
 
Q: And there was Polish people and Jewish people?   
 
A: All together, yeah. But as soon as the German come  in, you know, they saw what is all 
the difference. We were treated a little bit better because from the Jews, but we were 
always scared to go out because it was not very, very pleasant. Not easy.  
 
Q: How long were you in this facility?  Do you reme mber?

A: I can't  tell you exactly how long because--  
 
Q: Days, weeks?   
 
01:14:50 
 
A: It was couple, ma ybe one or two weeks until we find a shelter very, very far out from 
town and there we was ma ybe the whole time until -- this was 1939, and 1939, '40 the 
winter was very, very hard winter so we stay there until it makes 1940. I think 1940. So, I 
was, I was by Korczak.  
 
Q: Let me  just ask you a question and then I want to ask you about the orphanage. When you 
were in this bath house, wasn't  there any feeling of -- I don't know -- camaraderie, 
between the Polish people and the Jewish people because, in fact, you were all being 
invaded by the Germans?   
 
A: Not special, not special. No. Because first of all, I don't know, we was scared. If the 
Polish people was scared from the Germans, I don't know. But it was, there was a 
distance between the Jewish people and the Polish people because the German they start 
already -- the Jew. They take away everything from the Jews and they start to talk about 

the ghetto and they start, you know, every Jew have to have, you know, the Jew shtern
6
. 
So we -- there was a certain distance between the Polish and the Jews.  
 
01:16:22 
 
Q: Maybe the Polish thought they could protect themselves by separating?   
 
A: You know, it's very hard to tell you, because the Polish people -- I going to tell you just 
once. The antisemitic by the Polish people -- by the Polish woman there was already 
inject in the breast of fr om the woman and they give it to the children. But the children 
took the breast from their mothers and start to give them the milk. They give them the 

hateness for the Jews. And it was all over, all over, every time you have always, you 
know. There was terrible. Even sometimes you know this day I remember I stay up about 
two, three o'clock in the night to ma ke a line to have a piece of bread. And when one 

Polack or some body see a ma n what is a Jew, they threw him out. They kicked him out. 
They beat him.  
 
Q: And yet your early memories were good. Early memories everybody was friendly. It all 
changed. 
 
A: That doesn't  change. And I think nothing change today. I don't think some thing change

today.  
 
Q: But what I am saying is when you were young you lived around a lot of Polish people 
and everybody was friends?   
 
A: Yes. Because, you know, everybody was friends because we was young, little one. I was 
very young. So we don't see the difference but in the mome nt when we come  just to the 
reason, the mome nt when the brain start to work, they change. They change today 
because maybe, like I say, maybe the churches, maybe the priest, maybe they put the 

poison in this brains. Maybe the brainwash you, I don't know what. They always know 
that they pretend always, ﬁThe Jews they kill Christus -- Jesus Christus.ﬂ What I have to 
do with 2000 years with all this thing?   
 
Q: At what point were you sent to the orphanage and why were you sent there?   
 
A: I was sent to the orphanage because like I say we was poor. It was very hard and this 
time, it was time when I have to go to school and it was maybe very hard to my mother, 
you know. So some body give her the address from this orphanage and she put me  there.  
 
Q: Do you reme mber what year this was?   
 
A: This should be about '35, 1934, '35, ma ybe '36, in this year.  
 
Q: Can you tell me  in a full sentence what that is 1934, 1935 you were sent to the orphanage 
and tell me what it was called?  
 
A: What you mean it was called?   
 
Q: What was the name  of this orphanage?   
 
A: This was -- I'm sorry  Dom Sierot
7
. It was Polish this is orphan home for the orphanages 
and this was a  private -- not private, but we have to pay. But  I think they reach people 

from Warsaw who support themselves  and this was the hope -- the director -- maybe  for 
her was Dr. Janusz Korczak. His really name   is Henry Goldsmith. He was a doctor and 

they  have the Mrs. Wilczynska
8
, she was the  director too because Dr. Korczak doesn™t 
was always  there. I think he was busy, you know, to  collect the money, to collect all the 
things for  us. And he have always an audition on the  radio. He talk on the radio once a 
week, I think.

Q: He was well known?   
 
A: Yeah. And they call him the stary
9
 doctor, the old doctor. And I remember he took me 
once with him to the radio and he was -- moment I was I think, in September, October it 
was cold outside. He talk about the flu, and there was a mome nt I have to cough and I 
forgot to cough and he say ﬁCough, cough, cough.ﬂ And then I did it. He was a very, very 

nice ma n and we was there 107 children, 56 girls and 51 boys. My number was 46.  
 
Q: How old were you?   
 
A: Bitte
10
?  
 
Q: About how old were you?   
 
A: About six, seven years.  
 
Q: No, no, how old were you when you went into the orphanage?   
 
A: Seven years, ma ybe.  
 
Q: Oh, you were young?   
 
A: Yes, yes. They don't took old people because when you were 13, 14 years, you have to 
leave -- to live -- you have to go out because they took somebody else in your place.  
 
Q: Now, did your brothers and sisters go with you to the orphanage?   
 
A: I was alone but sometimes, every Saturday I go home to visit my parents and there, I was 
there a whole year. But in summertime we have a camp they call Kolonia Rózyczka
11
 and 
it was a vacation. I'm sorry. So when I come in they took me out from the school the 
Christian school and they send me to the Jewish school, not the Jewish, but it was a 
public school but it was most Jews was there. That was there. So when we have vacation 

so we went to the kolonia
12
 for two months and I have my little brother. So it was hard 
for me . It was so nice. It was so good that I have food. I have nice bed I have everything. 
He have to stay home, so I ask, I ma ke questions and they allow him. So I went home and 
he was in my place for one month.  
 
Q: Wa s this after you went to the orphanage, or before?

Q: The school you were talking about, was that part of the orphanage?   
 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  
 
Q: And the other thing I'm confused about, if you don't mi nd is -- now, you were born in 
1925?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And your father died in, around ma ybe 1935?   
 
A: I don't know.  
 
Q: You don't remember exactly?   
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you went to the orphanage after that. I was thinking you would be a couple years 
older?   
 
A: Maybe. 
 
Q: You don't reme mber exactly how old you were?   
 
A: I don't remember.  
 
Q: Okay. But your parents sent you?   
 
A: My mother, yes.  
 
01:24:00 
 
Q: Can you talk about life in the orphanage?   
 
A: Life in the orphanage, it was very nice. First of all, we, you know, everybody have his 
bed. You have to, like you say, sleeping places for the girls, for the boys, everybody have 
his own bed. And I think, like I remember this day, it was six, six-thirty in the morning. 
We  have to be washed, clothed and we have
 a breakfast and everybody have to prepare to 
go to school. We  went to school so we went to different schools. And the school --  I 
remember the first couple years when the first I start from the third degree because I was 
already-- so after school start one o'clock to six afternoon. So before we have breakfast 

and everybody have to ma ke his bed and we have to clean the beds. And the -- we have 
to ma ke the homeworks, and after we have lunch and then have to be dressed, shoes

shined and we went to school. And we have some  people, some  children who start the 
school at eight o'clock in the morning until one o'clock.  
 
Q: Did you -- was there a certain organization in the orphanage?  Did you each have 
responsibilities or --  
 
A: Yes. Everybody have his responsibilities, they have to take care. First one, the oldest take 
care the youngsters. So when you arrive about 10 years, 11 years and when a youngster 
come  in, so you take care of him. You teach him. You say the rules for the orphanage, 
you know. Until a certain time you was responsible for him. If he do something that not 

supposed to be, you be punished. Not him. But this guy, what was responsible for the 
child, he was punished. But children thinks it was very, very -- but still -- and you know, 
we have like supper all together. It was about seven o'clock supper and we could play. 

We  have ping pong. We  have a piano and we have lessons every day you could. They 
teach us to play ma ndolin if you want to or the piano. They teach us Hebrew always 
when you want to. Nobody force you to do some thing. And you know, they have all kind 

of -- wintertime, we went out and we play with winter things and we have, we can go ice 
skating too. So it was very, very nice, very pleasant. But Saturday after dinner everybody 
could go home to the parent or visit the parent or something like that, and sometimes we 

make a play in the orphanage and we would invite the parents and they come. We invite 
the parents and they come to ho
 see how the play.  
 
Q: Now, were the people -- the kids in the orphanage -- were they Christian or Jewish?   
 
A: No, no. It was just Jewish.  
 
Q: Just Jewish. What were the ages?  
 
A: The ages were from six to 14; 13, 14 years.  
 
Q: And how long did you stay in there?   
 
A: I was until the war, 1939, even I was longer. When I finished the school they find -- 
summe rtime and place I was working in an office. The office, the factory they ma ke all 
kind office supplies like pens, like all these things, and I was in the office there and this 
was summertime because my brother was in kolonia, so it was until 1939, until the 

Germans come  in. When the German come  in, so the owner from this company they give 
it over to peoples. I think they was swear in or something like that, and they go in. And 
when they swear and they go in, every Jew have to go out. We  Œ I was laid off from 

there. And at this time, like I say, I went back to the kolonia -- to the camp because in the 
wartime the peoples they steal the beds, and the mattress and the all the extras that we 
have there. So we call the police and they went with the police, to the houses, and take all 

the things back. So when the all the people, all the children going back to Warsaw 
because they think the school going to start. So we was three or five still there in the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
10 
 
camp to take care of that because we have -- it was a very, very big place. So this was 
until maybe -- ‚til 1941. I remember it was, I remember it was a winter there to take care, 
and after the Germans come and they make a ghetto for this camp because there was lots 
of barracks there. They have like sleeping block. Block for the boys, sleeping block for 

the girls, with a very big dining room. Have a kitchen. We  have a very big washroom, 
you know, to take showers and all this thing. And so Germans come  in. They took this 
away and they ma ke a ghetto. Because there was in town is called Wa wer, and they took 

all the Jews to put them, and they make a ghetto. And they started again with the killing 
there and with the shooting. All the things. So I was there a little time.  
 
01:29:00 
 
Q: I'm sorry to stop you, but I want to talk a little bit more about the orphanage before we 
talk about the ghetto, if you don't mi nd. So in the orphanage it sounds like you had a 

good time?   
 
A: Very good time.  
 
Q: Sounds like you had a good time. And tell me a little bit more about Dr. Korczak. What 
was he like?   
 
A: Dr. Korczak was a terrific ma n. He was good. This ma n was, I can't  describe you. He 
didn't have no hair. He have a little beard. He was a beautiful, good ma n. He was a 

doctor. He was a very, very good ma n, and he kiss everybody. He was so warm -- is very 
hard. Some thing wonderful, some thing terrific about this ma n and I wonder because 

nobody talk about him. They ma ke a movie but is far away from what he was really. He 
was a doctor -- really, really, really, really, good. He was like more than a father. He was 
a father to 107 and ma ybe Œ what do I say -- yes, 107 children -- but you have some 

teachers there, about 120 peoples.  
 
Q: It sounds like he was quite a character. He was going out and getting money. He was all 
over the place. He had Polish friends and Jewish friends?  
 
A: Yes. First of all, I don't think so. I don't know exactly, but I don™t think so. The Polish 
people, they wouldn't accept him like a Jew because his name is -- Korczak is really 
Polish name -- but his name is, was Henry Goldsmith. This was his really, really, really 
name . And I think he was from a very nice family and he travel very much before the 

war. He was in Berlin, he was in Austria and even the German, lots of German know 
him.  
 
Q: How was he able to accomplish all of this?  
 
A: I don't know. I can't  tell because unique. He was very, very nice and every time when 
some body was sick or what, he was always there. When we need him he was always

there.  
 
01:33:45 
 
Q: Do you have any other real distinct memories about him like the radio show?   
 
A: He was -- I reme mber once, like I say, he went once with him out in Poland and he had 
on always his uniform -- because he was ma jor in the army in the Polish Army. So you 
have the uniform and I tell him, ﬁDoctor, please, why you put the uniform?  It's so 
dangerous, it™s so dangerous. Why you don't take them out? ﬂ  He say, ﬁOh, no, this is my 

uniform. I'm a Polish soldier. I'm going to keep the uniform.ﬂ And I reme mber when we 
was in the camp, some  Polish people, wome n, come  in and ask for the Doctor, ﬁDoctor, 
please, my child is sick,ﬂ or something like that. It doesn't  make no question what kind, if 

it's Jew, if it's not Jew. What happened?  He took -- I remember he had a little, little bag. 
He took his little bag. He went to the people and doesn't  charge, doesn't  take any money. 
Don't take nothing. I don't think so, for this ma n he was any difference. He was -- he 

don't think any difference if he™s a Jew, if he™s not a Jew -- a human being, a child. That's 
it.  
 
Q: I understand he wouldn't wear the Jewish star?   
 
A: Bitte? 
 
Q: I understand he wouldn't wear a Jewish star?   
 
A: I don't think so, no. I don™t think so, I don't know if he speak Jewish. He never -- with 
other Jewish, if he speak Jewish, he never speak Jewish. Some thing like that, he was a 

human being. A 150 percent human being. I don't think so you can find me n like that 
today. He was...  
 
Q: Now, you were there for several years until the war?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you left, and at that point were 
any of your brothers and sisters also in the 
orphanage?   
 
A: No, no, no. It was just my little brother. He wasn't  in the orphanage. It was just in the 
vacation and camp there, but not special. He don't know his name, so they call him 
ﬁMaly
13
  Icekﬂ -- the ﬁLittle Icekﬂ. Because that's -- he was always one month, because, 
you know, vacation time, like here, they'r e vacation took two months and one month I 

was home and he was there.

Q: Now, you didn't really have to leave during the war because the orphanage stayed 
together, but were you at an age where you were ready to leave the orphanage?   
 
A: Yes. Just in the wartime in 1939 I was age, you know, to live there, but I couldn't come 
every day or once, twice a week to eat no supper, the meals with the friends all together 
until 1939, until the war. That's when the war, yes, 1940, until the war. So they need help 
because the camp was empty. Everything was stolen and the children, they was too 

young to go. So they ask me  if I would, I would and I say, yes, I -- and there was nothing 
to do there, the school. We  have no more school because the Jews, you couldn't go 
nowhere. So I went and I was there and then -- in the camp until the Germans make a 

ghetto. And after when they start with all this shooting and all this thing.  
 
Q: So you helped out with the orphanage a little bit when you were older?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ma ke good friends in the orphanage?   
 
A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I have very good friends I have even, yes, a little girlfriend -- very nice. 
She not survive. She go over, over with Korczak to the oven. 
 
Q: Do you reme mber what your duties were in the orphanage?   
 
A: My duty, yes. My duty was after breakfast I have to go and, you know, we have passages 
between the beds, and I have, I think, two passages to clean, with the broom and the floor 
was polished. That was my job and some times we change. So I have to wash the cups in 
the morning after breakfast, and there was a girl, Ewa Zylberberg, she is no more there.  
 
Q: She was your girlfriend in the orphanage?   
 
A: Yes, young love.  
 
Q: Veryyoung. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
01:39:00 
 
Q: Did the girls have different jobs than the boys or did everybody --  
 
A: Yes. It depends. They have to, but most of
 the girls were working in the clothes shop. Not 
the shop but, you know, like to sew the numbers, and some times they have, the socks to 
repair and to see after our clothes. Something like that.  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
13 
 
 
Q: Everybody had numbers on your clothes?   
 
A: Oh, yes. Everybody.  
 
Q: Why is that?   
 
A: Because not to mi x them, because I say I could have ma ybe 10, 11, 12 years and there 
was a little one who was six years who was ma ybe short, too high, so everybody have his 
clothes. So when they come  from the washing, everybody knows this one was his. 
Everybody know there one was his and there was one was hers -- everybody have a 

number and my number was 46. So, you know, if you go to take showers you have to 
change underwear, so the underwear was there. So I don't want to take some body else 
because I know my number is 46. So I have to take number 46, the socks were 46. 

Everything in the -- everything was marked.  
 
Q: Were there other ways in which the girls and the boys were different in the orphanage?   
 
A: There was girl and boys, yes. There was difference but, you know, we were -- they 
handled us exactly the same thing. They have tables, you know, the table -- I think we 
was six children, I think. So there was boys and girls together for the breakfast, for lunch 
or something like that. They was all together. There was no difference.  
 
Q: You just had different jobs?   
 
A: We  had different jobs. Even we went to 
school together, everything. Even in the same 
class together. We  was together but, you know, when it was time to go to bed, that's only 
difference. That's it.  
 
Q: It sounds like it was a really nice experience.  
 
A: I think it was one of the nice, this time in young. It was the nicest time, the best time in 
my life -- this time, you know, if you don't have no war. We  have everything. We  don't 

have no war. We have everything -- and you can™t imagine -- something is comi ng like 
holidays. When I say "holidays" the Christian holidays. So we have -- we receive 

oranges. It was some thing. You -- this was some thing in Poland for the war, an orange 
was some thing. You can't  dream about that. And this comi ng from Israel, you know, from 
Palestine. This time it was market; Jaffa oranges, bananas, all kind of fruit. Was 

something. It was amazing. Nobody can dream about this, in this time and it's as poor 
who we was.  
 
Q: How was Korczak able to get the money to do all of this?  
 
01:42:40 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017

A: Like I say, this guy, he doesn't  rest. He run the whole days and like I say -- there was 
very rich people in Poland, in Wa rsaw, and poor ones too. Wa s Jewish people, and they 
support and I think the Jewish organization from Israel to help him, lots of them. Because 
you know Mrs. Stefa Wilczynska, I think she went to Israel. This was ma ybe '36 or '37, I 

don't remember exactly, and the plan was to take all the orphanages, all the children to 
Israel. But no time. And after, when I was there, you know, when the German come  into 
Wa rsaw, they ma ke a ghetto. How we come  in it, I don't know. There I was in kolonia 

but I know it was very, very big problem. My brothers, my sisters, my mother, she 
doesn't  have food, she doesn™t Œ nothing to eat absolute nothing. So when they ma ke the 
ghetto in the camp. So I know a ma n, he was a butcher. So he come  to me  and say, ﬁYou 

know what, if you want to ma ke some  money, you can earn some  money. Like you have 
a face nobody can say you a Jew. You take meat. You go to the ghetto. You sell the me at. 
I give you the address, everything and you have some  money. You help me , you help 

yourself. You can help your family.ﬂ So at certain time every day in the morning, about 
five o'clock in the morning when the first streetcar pass -- because in the ghetto, Warsaw 
ghetto, it was a streetcar passing by the ghetto, but nobody can go down. It pass just the 

ghetto and it was from one Christian side to the other. Nobody can see go in, because 
there was police there and they take care. So I have every day, every day I have my 
shoulder -- I have in back, and I have meat. I don't remember exactly, maybe 25 kilo, 30 

kilo, and I have, a band with the -- and this one I took it. I have it in my pocket. So, he 
told me , he teach me , he say, ﬁYou know you go there and when the streetcar, it pass, it 
turn to the second street he slowed down, and this time you go down and you go in the 

house. You put on your things and you go, and this and this address. You said it, you™re 
going to have it.ﬂ But I say, ﬁbut the police!ﬂ  ﬁSo the police Œ don't worry, the police 
going to turn his back with the hand behind and you push in some  money and doesn't  see, 

doesn't  look at you.ﬂ It was to every day, every day.  
 
Q: This was the Jewish police or the German police?  
 
A: No, no. Polish police.  
 
Q: Polish police.  
 
A: Every day I go down and it was very -- at home -- that was nothing to eat, nothing, and I 
had to help them. And this one the of the reasons. That's why I help them I go over this 
meat.  
 
01:46:12 
 
Q: So you got on the streetcar?  You took off 
your armband and you went out to the Polish 
side to meet with --  
 
A: No. I go out from the camp. I was on the Polish side, so I don't have no band. Off. I went 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
15 
 
                                                          
to the streetcar. Off. I pay my streetcar and I have to take in correspondence and second 
ticket. And when I come in the street and I take the streetcar, the same streetcar, it pass 
the ghetto from the other side of the ghetto to the Polish side. So I go in and the 
policeman was there with his hand behind his back, I give him some money. I jump 

down. I put my armband and I was a Jew and nobody see. And when I sold the meat. I 
give the meat, I have some money so I could buy something, potatoes or something like 
that. I took it home. I give them and I go out and I wait exactly the same place. When the 

streetcar is comi ng, take off my band, jump on the -- and I was a Polack again. One day 
in this ghetto there was a man, a butcher too, he was killing the cattles so he say, ﬁyou 
know, I going to give youﬂ -- I remember very, very, well, ﬁ25 zlotys.ﬂ It was very, very, 

much money -- ﬁwhen you bring me  my knife.ﬂ You know, the ma n have a special knife 
to kill. So I say, ﬁokay.ﬂ You know, young, no brains, I don't see the danger what I going 
to do. So he give me  the address and when I go down with my meat, I sold the meat. I go 

to my mother, give her the money. So I go in this place and I think he going give me a 
little knife. She give me a knife like that, so I say, ﬁI promise, ‚I™m going to do it, I™m 
going to do it.ﬂ I put the knife -- it was in box -- I put it in here between my shirt and my 

body. I put it there and exactly the same thing. Jump on the streetcar. But I don't go in the 
streetcar. I was just in the front by the driver and when I was there, two Gestapo come 
out. They doesn't  talk to me. I don't talk to them. I was quiet do nothing and I went ‚til 

the end on the streetcar until the terminus of the streetcar. And I bring him the knife. And 
he was wondering, ﬁHow you do that? ﬂ   He give me  25 dollars. You can imagine what 
this 25 dollars in this days, lots and lots of money. And when they start, you know, with 

the Jews and they start to make trouble, and they start to take the Jews to the 
concentration camps from Wa rsaw. And I say ﬁStop, I have to go.ﬂ  
 
01:49:25 
 
So I run away and I was ma rching from Wa rsaw to Plonsk -- that's about 50 kilometers. 
There, my older brother was there, my mother was there, and there it doesn't  -- was, you 
know, Poland was split. The Generalgouvernement
14
 and the annexed territory and there 
was territory Œ so I want to go there, and I was walking two days and when I arrived there 

so. It was okay the first time. There was no ghetto there and they was living not so very 
well, but okay. We  was in little room, like here would be ten peoples, but it was okay and 

I start to work by turps
15
. You know what turps?  Turps, that's when they take a piece out 
from the air and when it was dry the people burn that, like coal. And I was working very, 
very, very hard when I was working there and I --  
 
Q: Can I stop you a mome nt?

Q: First of all how are we on tape?  I want to ma ke sure we have enough tape. I want to just 
go back to the ghetto a mi nute. I'm sort of curious about what it was like in the ghetto and 
how your life changed and how your family lived and what a day was like?   
 
A: Oh, God.  
 
Q: I know it's not a happy me mory.  
 
A: First of all, they took all the Jews.  
 
Q: Can you start out by just saying in the ghetto?   
 
A: In the ghetto, exactly what happened in the ghetto, I can't  tell you. I was not very long in 
Warsaw in ghetto, but I know everytime -- when I come there, I see people lying outside 

starving. The German come  in, they laughing, you know, they ma ke all kind of pictures 
from the poor peoples and it was is very, very hard to explain you. It's not a life. The 

people you have -- the people are dead, all dead. You don't have nothing there, nothing 
there. No food, cold. Peoples was outside begging you for pieces of bread and some , they 
have children they go in the past the wall, you know, to the Polish side to take some thing, 

to have some  potatoes and when they was chased fr om the Germans, they kill them, they 
shoot them, I -- you know, I can't  explain to you. I can't  explain.  
 
01:52:40 
 
Q: Did you ever see this happen?   
 
A: I saw, yes. I remember once like I said, you know, one time I have my meat on my back 
and I have to go, and I couldn't go down because they have a German soldier, German 

gendarme was in the tram. I couldn't go down. I have to go ‚til the other side. When I 
arrived there it was just in cemetery, in Jewish cemetery. To go to the ghetto, I have to 

pass the cemetery and I arrive in the mi ddle from the cemetery. They start to shoot. I 
hear, you know with the machine gun, and I was there. So I said, ﬁNow is finished.ﬂ So, 
you know in this time there was so ma ny dead people, because by the Jews you have no 

right to make the grave before you have the body at the cemetery and the preparer of the 
holes. One thing that I have to do is I have to jump there and I have lie the whole night 
between two deads -- and I hear what the shooting, what the machine guns around and 

they was walking over my head. So you can imagine. It was the whole night there in this 
hole.  
 
Q: Should we stop and change tape?

Tape #2
 
 
02:00:39 
 
Q: All right. So let's just talk a little bit more about the conditions and in the ghetto and the 
structure of it. What was going on with the Jewish council and the Jewish police?   
 
A: It was the Jewish police to take care and sometimes they make -- they took the peoples go 
out from the ghetto, you know, with the Germans to work. All kind of work. Like 
wintertime to clean the snow, clean the highways and all kind of things like that. And 
some times they took them to work, you know, to ma ke the uniforms for the Germans. 

But there was nobody have the chance to have some thing and it was very, very, very, 
hard in Warsaw. In the street and every place, you have dead peoples, and peoples 
begging. It was, you know, horrible to see. Really is very, very hard to explain. It's just -- 

I can't  believe that I passed there. I saw all this. It's no human nature can see this. You 
know, I saw lots of things but it was, it's really terrible. I can't  understand, you know, 
because the Germans they are cultivated people and they couldn't do things like that. I 

can't  understand it. I can™t, I can't  understand it.  
 
02:02:20 
 
Q: Were there activities going on? Was there any semblance of real life in the ghetto? Was 
there music?  Was there school?   
 
A: Yes, school. Nobody school, you know, when some times you have the teachers, the 
Jewish teachers were teaching in the school before the war. They'r e teaching their own 
children. They can do that for nothing. Nobody want to pay. And every time when the 
Jewish community, the community when the German make and they™re always -- they 

ask for money and they ask the peoples to work and they send the peoples, you know, to 
the different camps to break the stones to ma ke highways, and all kind of things. Because 
the Germans, they was the was the worst. The work -- they need the uniforms. They need 

everything, so the Jews was very cheap labor. So they took the peoples and that's it. 
Sometimes, I remember, my brother tell me once he was Œ they took him in school, in a 
big school, and they give him brush, teeth br
ush to wash the floors. And there was the 
ladies™ room, they have to take off pants and to clean it. It was terrible.  
 
02:03:47 
 
Q: Now, weren't there also more secretive activities going on? Weren't there youth 
organization and schools and cultural activities?   
 
A: Nothing. You have some times, but you need money for clubs. We  have some  clubs. We  
have some  singers. We  have some  players. But you need money to get in. Where you 
going to take the money?   

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
18 
 
 
Q: So there wasn't  so much?  
 
A: There was nothing, most of nothing. It was ve
ry hard for the living, very hard. And after 
they start to evacuate the ghetto, to take to Majdanek, to Treblinka, and the peoples they 
start to know they kill these people. So it was the ghetto uprising. Maybe you remember. 
Maybe you hear about that. It was too something terrible and this people inside, they 

begging outside they ask to help. They ask the Russian, they a and the American, they 
ask the German. I think the English to help to send some  weapons, send some  
ammunition. Nothing is comi ng, absolute nothing, nothing, nothing. So what they do?  

They kill out -- they killed everybody and they burn. The whole ghetto was destroyed. 
Everything was destroyed.  
 
02:05:27 
 
Q: But there were youth organizations that were involved in the resistance there?   
 
A: The youth organizations doesn™t help us
 with absolute nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, 
nothing.  
 
Q: There was --  
 
A: They couldn't help.  
 
Q: It didn't work, but there was resistance?   
 
A: There was Resistance, yes, and the underground too, but the underground was from the 
Polish people, and some  people, some  Jews, they was escaped from the ghetto, escape 

from the uprising. They went to the partisans, you know. And that's all, I think.  
 
Q: Well, there was also resistance within the ghetto?  
 
A: The what?   
 
Q: There was also resistance effort inside the ghetto?  
 
A: Inside the ghetto, but not in this time. It was when they start to evacuate this ghetto 
because nobody, nobody can imagine they going to send peoples -- they going to burn 

their whole family. They are going to kill their whole family, and the killing going on and 
going on and going on, until they come , until to Wa rsaw. There was the uprising, but 

what could they help?  They had nothing, no rifles, no absolute nothing. They have little 
bit, but absolute nothing.  
 
Q: Now, I think we were talking about this off camera, so I just want to ma ke sure you say 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
19 
 
this for the record, that where was your family and where were you at this point?   
 
A: What?  
 
Q: I just want you to say what you told me  for the record, which was essentially, that your 
family was in the ghetto, you, one of the youngest, were out doing things. How did all of 
this happen?   
 
A: You know, when we was in shelter after, when the Germans come  in, and because the 
apartment we was living was burned up. We  had absolute nothing. So we went to the 

bath house and we find a shelter, but when the Germans come  in we have to move from 
there to the ghetto. I was with Korczak at this time. This was in 1940, '41, I think.  
 
Q: You need to explain to us that you were no longer really in the orphanage at this point. 
You were at --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were at the summe r camp?   
 
A: At this time I was -- this was in summer. I think in summertime they move fr om Warsaw 
to the camp. And they ask me , too, if I want to go to the camp. I say, ﬁyeah,ﬂ because I 
didn™t have nothing to do there, and they start the ghetto in Warsaw. All the Jews have to 
go to the ghetto Œ towards the ghetto, and this time even my mother say, ﬁWhat you 

going to do here?  Go to camp.ﬂ I went to camp and how to come  to the ghetto, I don't 
know. I know once, you know, they give me  the address. I knew they was in the ghetto 
and there was very, very bad situation. Very bad situation. They was hungry. They have 

nothing to eat, and ﬁthis,ﬂ I decide ﬁthis time.ﬂ So I have possibility to help them and this 
was my opportunity to help them, risk my life to help them.  
 
Q: And this was because you were outside of the ghetto?   
 
A: Yes, that™s right.  
 
Q: But you moved pretty freely between the ghetto and outside the ghetto. You seemed to 
get back and forth pretty well.  
 
A: Yes. I have to go and I was feeling very angry because I saw the Polish people, the Polish 
boys in my age they running free. They eating. They have everything, and I have to 

hiding myself all over. Take care. Doesn't talk, doesn't  speak, doesn't  go nowhere. You 
keep yourself. You just -- you know, because don™t forget one thing, ﬁYou a Jew, you a 

Jew, you don™t have no right to live.ﬂ  
 
Q: Did you pretend you weren't a Jew?   

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
20 
 
                                                          
 
02:10:00  
 
A: I pretend I wasn't  a Jew, but one thing I know. I say to myself, ﬁIf this was finished, I 
don't want to be any more a Jew. I don't know why they hate me . I don't do nothing. I 
can't  understand. I don't want to -- I want to be free. I want to eat. I want a piece of bread 
like everybody. I don't want to hate you.ﬂ This was in my mi nd.  
 
Q: This is while you were still a boy before the camps?   
 
A: Before the concentration camp -- ma ybe not. When I escaped from Wa rsaw, I went, you 
know, to my family. There I know there was Jew. It was hard for me  too, some times I 
think about not to be Jew, but I born a Jew, I couldn't help it.  
 
Q: So when you were helping your family, they
 were in the ghetto. You were on the outside. 
When you were on the outside, did you talk to people, did you pretend you weren't a 

Jew?   
 
A: I don't talk to nobody. I was scared, very scared, you know. Each time, if some body 
recognize me or what, because first of all, with the meat. Second, if a Jew, they kill me -- 

they kill me one hundred per cent. Not scared Œ yes, I was scared but it was, I say, look, 
like what they can do to me?  Kill me, that™s it. Not kill, but hang me? That's it, you know. 

Because they say if you™re a Jew, a bullet too expensive. I couldn't help.  
 
Q: Did you ever spend much time in the Warsaw ghetto?   
 
A: Every time a couple hours, but really long time, no.  
 
Q: Wa s there any sort of confinement or ghetto up at Rose Camp
16
?  
 
A: No. I don't think so. One thing, I was very happy when I went out. I feel a little bit, I'm 
free a little bit, but outside. But inside, you know, my heart was beating very, very -- 
every time when I was in gendarme -- in the German gendarme I said, ﬁOh! You finished, 
you finished.ﬂ Like the same  thing when I have the knife in my back and why I go on this 

streetcar. Just the two Gestapo come  in, and I don't want to say they followed me , but in 
the way Œ they went in the same  way that I was. Believe me , you know, if I'm today alive, 
I don't have a heart attack this time, oh, I was very, very strong. So when I come in I give 

him this knife. I say to myself, ﬁIf I can do that, I can do some thing else.ﬂ  
 
Q: I thought you said there was a ghetto up at the camp also.  
 
A: Yes, yes, yes. So I was there and so, you know, they have some  peoples in the ghetto, but

they have family in Wa rsaw and they was young peoples, and they ask me  if I want to 
bring them to the ghetto. And I say, ﬁLook, I can™t go.ﬂ So I go with this peoples. They 
pay me  but it doesn't  pay very much. They pay me  just, you know, they pay me  just a 
dinner or something like just for survival, but nothing special. I make it because I can 

help. But nothing special. But to understand this, that the shooting and the killing there 
and my family was already dead. As I say, ﬁStop, is enough, you have to run away from 
here.ﬂ So I go away and, you know, it was about 70 kilome ters. I went there and I was 

wandering two days without food, because when I come  on the border, was -- on one side 
was the Polish police, and on the other side was the German police and, ﬁHalt, where are 
you going? ﬂ  ﬁI go working to the farm to keep the potatoes,ﬂ because it was not me 

alone, but some Polish people did traveling, too. So I listen to him. I say, ﬁI go for the 
potato.ﬂ So, ﬁI go for the potatoﬂ and I was a young boy, so they let me  pass. And I have 
some  couple money. They took away the money but I don't care. I went, and we have to 

pass a bridge and I say, just two Germans gendarmes. And they go just to me , and I say 
ﬁAy, ay, two gendarmes, it™s finished with you.ﬂ But behind me  was an old woma n with a 
little boy and they stopped the woma n, and I pass.  
 
02:15:40 
 
And I come  on the road and it was two gendarmes and they threw out a family from this 

house -- ma ybe they want to take the house -- and they threw out and they say ﬁHey, 
come  here.ﬂ And they say, ﬁhelp,ﬂ and I help these people to put on the wagon. And I 
remember it, was a bread, a big, big bread and the bread fell down and the hard side fell 

down. So I take the hard side, I put it in my jacket and -- because eight days I don™t eat 
no piece of bread -- and I help them, but this piece I hide for me. And I sit on the wagon 
and they bring me to a little point because they turn and I have to go straight and I go 

straight. And I go to the farm and I ask, ﬁMaybe you have place to sleep? ﬂ  So it's an old 
farm. They say, ﬁLook, I have one place but here you can sleep -- there is a lady laying in 
bed -- if you want.ﬂ So the lady in one side and I was on the other side. The whole night I 

eat this bread. The next day, in the morning, I say, ﬁoff.ﬂ I go to the town and I was in the 
family. But in certain time the peoples from this town, they need papers. I don't have no 
papers and the paper was, you know, the fingerprint and this one is the Bloody Sunday. 

The Gestapo come  in, in this town and they throw out -- everybody have to go out, and 
they start to control the papers. I don't have no papers. My brother doesn't  have papers. If 
he don't have no papers, so they have to start to hit the stakes over the head, over the 

back, all over. Because if you don't have paper, you have to go on this side. If you are 
going to see my brother Œ he has here, on his lip, was open fr om hitting him.  
 
Q: This is the town of Plonsk,  
 
A: Plonsk, yes. And they put us and they going to ask you for the bloody Sunday. I'm going 
to tell you about this. They put everyone on a field. I don't know, ma ybe a thousand 

peoples, on one field and we stay there two nights, one night or two nights, I don't 
remember. And they put us in a camp. They will call Pomi echówek and this was a really

death camp. And there we was, I think, six week. I can't  explain the trouble what they 
have there. It was those barracks, stone barracks and was so many peoples. We have to 
lay down on the floors like the herring, you know, in the tins. If one want to turn, 
everybody have to turn. Soon it was dark until morning. You have to stay there. It was 

very, very hard, but one thing it was not German, I think, it was Germans but it was the 
SA. Maybe you hear about SA -- Sturma bteilung
17
 -- that's when the Germans with war, 
the brown shirts and with the Hakenkreuz
18
. It was very, very bad peoples. There was, 
there was Volksdeutsche
19
, it was most of the Polacks, but there was maybe Germans, I 
don't know what kind. It was very, very bad and they was very bad peoples. They hit us. 

We  don't have no food. And I can't  explain what kind of trouble what -- I don't know how 
we survived there. There was hundred and hundred of people and, you know, we couldn't 

have no washroom, nothing. So they ma ke a grave in hole with a stake and everybody, 
wome n, me n all together, we have to go there, if we need to go. And some times a passing 
German push in. I can't  explain. And was always one, he pass in the barrack and tell, 

ﬁYou stay up!ﬂ  When you stay up is okay. When you kind of stay up so fast, so he have, 
ﬁYou sick. Take out to kill.ﬂ And they shoot every day, every day, you hear the guns. 
They shoot these people something terrible. And my little brother, Erwin he was there, 

but he escaped. And how I come  out from there, I don't know. I don't know, I don™t 
remember. I know once my brother told me I was sick. I had typhus and all these people 
that have typhus they have to be killed. And I remember one time I was laying on the 

outside to wait until they going to shoot me. So I know once my brother, the oldest one, 
come  and take me  on his shoulder and put me  in a wagon. They run away and they pass, 
and we have to go, they send us back to Wa rsaw to the ghetto. Before comi ng to Wa rsaw 

to the pass the, the front, they make a big fire, and all these people have to pass this fire. 
The other side there was the ghetto, the free, but we have to pass this fire. We have so 
ma ny -- you feel it. You pass on the people that first down. They couldn't survive.  
 
Q: You went through the fire?   
 
A: Through the fire.  
 
Q: It was a big fire?   
 
A: Was a big fire and my brother, I don't remember, but my brother told me because we 
pass. I know I have smell the burn, smell the burn.  
 
Q: So you had to walk through this fire to get to the ghetto?   
 
A: Wa lk the fire, pass the fire to go in the ghetto, back to the Wa rsaw ghetto. And when we 
arrived in the Warsaw ghetto, I don't remember exactly what happened, but once I was

laying on the floor, and I was in a hospital and they wash myself and they put me in a bed 
in the hospital. And there was maybe one or two days and I start to cry, because they put 
some body in the bed with me . And so there was a nurse come  in and she ask me , ﬁWhy 
you crying? ﬂ  So I say, ﬁI don't know, they put some body in ma ybe he have typhus. I™m 

going to have too.ﬂ So she say, ﬁWhat you think what are? ﬂ and they let me there a 
couple days. A couple days, ma ybe one week, and when I was already health more, so I 
went out and I reme mber it was just a wagon come  in with stones. The me n, they ask me , 

ﬁHey, you want to help me  to put down the stones? ﬂ  I say, ﬁyes.ﬂ They give me  50 cent 
and I buy pickle, a sour pickle. And I found my brother. We don't have no place to go. 
We  don't have no place to sleep. We  don't have no money. Absolute nothing. So my 

brother told me , ﬁWhat you going to do? ﬂ  So, you know, in Poland in the houses there 
was the stoves and they have in the ovens, they have the doors. There was like a cup and 
the houses that was destroyed. So we took that and we sold it. We  have some  money. We  

pay a guy Œ and we go out from the ghetto and we have just enough to pay to buy a 
bread, because we want to go back to the same  town where my mother and my sister. 
 
Q: And this is Plonsk?   
 
A: Yeah. And we have just enough money to buy a bread, but from there we have to pass a 
bridge to the station and from the station we have to take a little train to, I don't 

remember. And this town a little bit closer to Plonsk. So we go to the, into the train. We 
have already tickets -- no. There was -- we was waiting outside because the train -- 

some body come  I don't know, it was a Polack, I don't reme mber, a woma n or a man Œ and 
she say, ﬁDon't go in because they can recognize you, you a Jew and they going to send 
you back or they going to arrest you.ﬂ So I say, ﬁBut we want to go.ﬂ So he or she, I 

don™t remember, ﬁGive me your money. I will go buy tickets.ﬂ So we give him the money 
and he buy tickets for us and we have the tickets. We go in the train. We sit on the train 
and this train start to go. So he™s comi ng, the control man for the ticket, so he looks, ﬁAre 

you Jews?  I going to call the Gestapo.ﬂ So I start to cry, ﬁWhy you going to call the 
Gestapo?  We  don't do nothing. We  want to go.ﬂ ﬁNo, no, you Jews. You don't have the 
right to go. You don't have the right to be here.ﬂ So I say, ﬁWhat can I do? ﬂ  So he say, 

ﬁPay me .ﬂ So I say, ﬁWhat can I pay you?  We  don't have no money. We  don™t have 
nothing.ﬂ One thing my brother say, ﬁMaybe you going to give him a gown.ﬂ I reme mber 
I had a gown for my sister, a nightgown. So I tell him, ﬁLook, I have a nightgown. If you 

want to, I give you the nightgown.ﬂ He said, ﬁyes
.ﬂ I have to go to the end train, take out 
the nightgown and give him the nightgown. So, he let us go. So we went a couple miles 
and we go down. We  don't have no money. We  don't have nothing to eat. We  have to 

live. We  have to do some thing. So actually, you know what, we go here we go begging. 
So I took to the house and some body give us some  beets. So we have beets. We eat the 
beets and we sleep outside. And we stay and 
we go again, and they stay and we go again. 

This time we walking again. We  want to go to this town and it's very hard. It's not so 
easy, so --  
 
Q: You™re walking to this town?

A: Yes. 
 
Q: How far is it?   
 
A: About 70 kilome ters and we was running with the train, ma ybe 10 or 15 kilome ters. But 
there was some body. He ma ke travel past the peoples. So we ask him, ma ybe he want to 
travel, to help us to travel. So he say, ﬁYes, but you have to pay me .ﬂ But we have 
nothing. So I reme mber when I was in camp I receive a pair of boots from UNRRA
20
 or 
the Jewish Committee
21
 -- I don't remember. So I say, ﬁYou know, that I have boots. I 
can give you -- you take my boots.ﬂ And we past there. And we was together certain time 
and after they took us to the concentration camp, so they start there with the 
concentration camp. Exactly the same  thing, you know.  
 
02:28:07 
 
Q: Now this Bloody Sunday in Plonsk, going back a little bit. Did this take place in a lot of 
towns at the same time?  
 
A: I don't know. I know it take place -- one second, I think it take in two or three places in 
Plonsk and it was a couple kilometers was in town, the same thing, the same thing. That™s 
the Bloody Sunday.  
 
Q: Is it unusual that you went from ghetto to a camp then back to the ghetto?  Is that 
unusual?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Because generally when the people leave the ghetto they leave for good, right?   
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You were very resourceful.  
 
A: What?  
 
Q: You were very resourceful.  
 
A: What can I do?  I have to. I can't  help. And then after when we was the last ghetto the last 
time. So, you know, the propaganda was from the German and they say, ﬁDon't worry. 

The oldest people, your old people, you're 
going to work.ﬂ This was the propaganda.

ﬁTook what you can, warm clothes most important. Took it to a Jew and you're going to 
work, okay?  The youngest people, they are going to work. The older people they'r e going 
to keep the children and the household.ﬂ So this was the reason. Most the Jewish people, 
they go, but nobody can imagine -- but when, you know, they going die it was already 

too late. They'r e already there. They couldn't help. So first I know when they start to send 
tickets. ﬁThis family, this family, this family.ﬂ  
 
Q: I'm sorry. Were you at this point?   
 
A: In Plonsk. Now, I told you Wa rsaw was already liquidated. It wasn't  completely 
liquidated but is started.  
 
Q: What year do you think this was?   
 
A: This was 1941, 1942.  
 
Q: But was Warsaw ghetto wasn't  liquidated that early, I don't think.  
 
A: They start, I think, but the uprising was in, I think --  
 
Q: '43?  
 
A: '43. So they start -- first of all, in Warsaw, there was a big ghetto. There was lots of 
people and there lots of Jews was working for the Germans and the factories, like the 

tailors for the uniform. And so this when they start already to evacuate.  
 
02:31:12 
 
Q: To evacuate?  
 
A: And to evacuate it. And first one -- the policy from the Germans they say, ﬁWhy do we 
have to kill them? They are going to kill themselves.ﬂ And that's true. The people 

starving on the streets, no food. In the wintertime the people was freezing completely, 
dead freezing, dead. They have nothing. So they don't care. So they just to help so they 

evacuated to Treblinka. And Treblinka, soon they come in and the older people, the 
woman, the older men and children, they put them on the trucks. The trucks come into 
the crematorium to say, ﬁYou go to bath. You going to take a shower.ﬂ But the shower is 

gas. That's it. And there in Plonsk they start to send people to get this family and this 
family and that family. They have to be at this time and that time, and that time they have 
to be at the station. On the grand Platz
22
 was the place they have to be there. At this time 
my mother and the younger brother and the two sisters -- my sisters receive the paper. 
My brother and I were supposed to stay there, but -- and they took them back. So after,

you know, he™s comi ng, an officer and he say, ﬁWho want to go to have place?  Who want 
to go? ﬂ  So, I say to my brother, ﬁWhat they going to do here? ﬂ  The ghetto was -- this 
town was three-quarter empty. ﬁWhat we going to do?  Come , we'r e going to work. Come  
we'r e going, too.ﬂ So we going and this was when the family was together. My mother, 

sister, my little brother was together until they send us to Auschwitz and this took, I 
think, three or four days just traveling.  
 
Q: What was it like on that train ride?  
 
A: We  was packed. Peoples was crying, you know, packed. No food, no water. Absolute 
nothing. But the one chance it was in, I think, in fall, so it doesn™t was very hot. So you 

don't feel this so thirsty like in summertime and that helped, a lot. So we arrived, I 
remember we arrived in Auschwitz. It was at night or very early in the morning, and 

when we go out from the trains they start to beating and to shoot. So I say to my brother, 
I say, ﬁCome, we have to go fast so we don't be beat.ﬂ So we was all together and he is 
comi ng, the German, and they start, ﬁMen, and wome n on the other side.ﬂ  
 
02:34:25 
 
Q: I'm sorry, may I stop you?  I want to hear a little bit more about the trip on the train. It 
took several days. Did you know where you were going?   
 
A: No, no. We  know we want to go to work. And when we went in the train, so, I think, I 
was young, but I think peoples in mi nd couldn't imagine this finish. We  go to death.  
 
Q: Had you had any information on the camps?   
 
A: No, we didn't have -- like I say nothing. They say always, ﬁDon't worry. Everything be 
fine. You go to work.ﬂ But when we was on the train, the train was blocked, nobody can 
open. But now it was too late. But for me , I don™t know, I couldn't believe, could happen 
things like that. So I say to myself, ﬁThey told us, we going to work, okay?  We 'r e going 

to work.ﬂ But who couldn't believe from, we know. Every day the German was a very 
polite people. The German was very [unintelligible] people. Who couldn't imagine. They 
imagine and kill machine like that. It's impossible. But then we go to -- when we arrive in 

Auschwitz and they separate me n and wome n, children with wome n. So I say, ﬁOh, this 
smell not good.ﬂ And comi ng Mengele
23
 and he come in and he start, ﬁMenﬂ -- all like 
the young men, like I and my brother, healthy, from the regular to the bigger Œ so ﬁright.ﬂ 

ﬁLeftﬂ and my little brother have to go the women. And like I say, I was feel like 
some thing wrong. So we was there and we was the first of the first, because I say, always 

you have to be careful not to be beaten. If not
, they kill you with stakes, with pipes, with 
rubber, with all this thing?  So I he come  and, you know, the German was like that. He 

was tall. He jumped between his legs and come  in my side, and I was there with a friend -
 
23
 Josef Mengele (1911-1978? ), German docto r and SS officer. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
27 
 
- my, my friend live today, is in Toronto-- they lift him little bit and he started to look, 
start to -- it's too late. They don't see him and we was together.  
 
02:37:00 
 
Q: So you were able to have your little brother come with you?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, how did you know this was Dr. Mengele?   
 
A: I recognize him after because he came to our camp. I saw him many time because when I 
was already in camp, they ma ke selection, you know, about selection. Yeah, the one have 
to die. The one have to go to the gas chamber. So we have to unclothed, take out the 
clothes and we have to pass like in barrack and the barrack was -- it doors. There was two 

doors. One there was no the block, the chief block and they have to get the prisoners first 
in the second, so it was to the -- so we have to go out from one door and down, and 
Mengele was there and we pass by him and he look at you, and the chief on the block, 

you have -- a card -- you don't have no names. We have just a number and he have the 
card, you know, and we pass. So I know. I see him ma ny times and peoples out there, 
they know him before, ﬁthis one is Dr. Mengele,ﬂ and so...  
 
Q: So you got off the train and there was a lot of shouting?   
 
A: A lot of shouting and separation and crying and all kind of things. And after you pull 
together and after we went on ma rch to Auschwitz and went into concentration camp. 
From the station in Auschwitz we went to concentration. The first thing that we saw, you 
know, they bring us just on the wires, electri
fied wire, doubled wires, and we saw some  
people hanging on, so he say, ﬁYou see that?  In case some body want to escape, he going 
to have exactly the same  thing.ﬂ So they put us, you know -- first, there was outside ma ny 
couple hours. After we have to take off our clothes. We  went to the barber to cut the hair 

completely, and showers. After the showers we have to go to the room. And they ma ke 
the numbers, and they ma de the numbers, you know, the numbers with little point and 
they, I don't know what with, a pen or some thing like that. And they make the numbers.  
 
02:40:00 
 
Q: Did it hurt?   
 
A: Oh, yes. But a couple days later it was okay.  
 
Q: Did you still think you were going to work?   
 
A: To work?   

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
28 
 
 
Q: Did you still think the reason you were going there was just to work?  
 
A: At this time, no. At this time I thought I was finished. This time I was finished and the 
peoples, you know, because it was -- already people was prisoners in Auschwitz and this 
I always say, ﬁDon't think you go some  place to work. Once you can go, you see the 
chimney there? ﬂ  We saw the chimney -- the smell, the smell. ﬁThis what I told you. See 

the chimney?  That's where the crematorium.ﬂ The first time, I didn't know what he mean 
and he, ﬁburn the people.ﬂ And so I ask, ﬁBurn alive? ﬂ  And he said, ﬁNo, no, no. First, 
all the people go in the gas chamber and from the gas chamber they go in there.ﬂ  
 
Q: Now what year was that?   
 
A: The what?   
 
Q: What year do you think this was?   
 
A: I don't know.  
 
Q: Do you think this was about 19-- 
 
A: What year?  I'm sorry. It was beginning '42, I think, beginning '42. Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. So after you're showered then you're tattooed and you're with your brothers?   
 
A: The two brothers, yes. And we still together. No food, nothing. And we have to go to the 
tailor room with the numbers and they give us numbers to put on. They give us the 
uniform. Some  uniform is too long, too short, and they took away the shoes. They give 
you some  wood shoes, and here was some  stuff, tissue, and wood shoes, they are very, 

very hard to walk. And one moment we lose my brother, the older one. The little one is 
still with me. And we was there in Auschwitz about three days, I don't remember exactly 
how long. It always was the same . We  have to go to tailor. You have to put your number 

on your pant and on your jacket, and they took us  to Buna I.G. Farben district. And this 
was about three kilome ters from Auschwitz. So we go there. It was, I think, at night. I 
don't reme mber exactly because we have to pass the town in Auschwitz. Maybe he 

doesn't  want the people to see the prisoners. I don't know exactly. And there we go to 
Buna there. We arrive there and we went to quarantine.  
 
Q: What was that?   
 
A: Quarantine. 
 
02:43:18 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017

Q: Why is that?   
 
A: Quarantine. They think ma ybe we are sick or we have some  typhus or some thing like 
that. So if some body going to be sick, they have to kill all the peoples. So we was there 
six week. It was very, very bad. Every day we have to ma ke some  exercise. Every day it 
was the same  thing. The hanging and killing and beating and every day. Sometimes, you 

know, they hang us with the hands in the back and they hang us just like that. And, you 
know, who was the chief, it was the murder -- German murder. No one else but the 
murderers. But the Germans, they was maybe condemned to death. The place to kill 

them, they put them in concentration camp and it was the chief of the Jew, from the 
Jewish Häftlinger
24
. And this was six weeks there, and after six week, we have to go to 
work. They send us off and we went to the camp where all the peoples. And ma ybe this 

time the whole camp was ma ybe six, 800 people. And we when there just to build this 
concentration camp, and we start to work there and we make the wire and the barracks, 

because every time when the camp was ready, they was comi ng always new prisoners 
from all the countries. From Poland, from Belg
ium, from Czechoslovakia, from all over, 
all over. And then in the end, I think there was about 15 or 18,000 prisoners there in this 
camp. And there was a, ma ybe you read about the I.G. Farben industry, and they have a 
factory. They ma ke all for the war. They ma ke ammunition. They ma ke even gasoline for 
the planes.  
 
Q: Wasn't  this a synthetic rubber plant?   
 
A: It was a plant.  
 
Q: For rubber?   
 
A: What?  
 
Q: For rubber?   
 
A: No you take -- some  peoples was working you know in the coal mi ne. So from the coals, 
they take out and make the gasoline and they make all the things, and we build it all 
together. And it was exactly the same thing. And after, they bring over there maybe, you 
know -- in the end it was in this I.G. Farben ma ybe one million people was working 

there. All kind of nationality you can imagine. Even the war prisoners from Americans, 
English peoples, French peoples, all of the soldiers that was taking --  
 
Q: How long did it take you to do this construction, do you reme mber?

A: We  work always. The construction take about two, three years to build up everything, 
that the kind of work. And it was very, very hard. Every day we lose lots and lots of 
peoples dying there, by working very hard job. Very hard labor -- very hard job. You 
have to stay up about five o'clock in the morning and it was Appellplatz
25
, cold winter.  
 
Q: Tell me a little bit about the Appell
26
?  
 
A: It was a very, very big place and there was the barracks, and in each barracks was the -- 
depends, 100, 150 me n and we have to go up, you know, in the morning. Some times they 
give you a little bit of coffee, water, and you have to go to the Appell.  
02:48:00 
 
Q: What time was this?  
 
A: They count so ma ny, so ma ny. They have to. They know exactly how ma ny peoples. And 
it was a block -- block one to 53. I don't reme mber. And each block you have so many, so 

ma ny peoples, and so we have to stay to five and they count every block in the morning, 
so much and so ma ny, and they look on the list. If exactly number people what there are, 

even dead. Even some body die, we have to take him out, you know, to -- he count like 
prisoner. It was very hard in the beginning. I was Œ you know first, I don't understand 
German at this time and they talk always German. And like soldiers, so in the morning 

when the German pass, so you know, they give orders the ﬁMützen ab!ﬂ
27
 -- that mean 
take off your. And first of all, you have to be straight out, it was two words, it was very 
hard to understand for me, ﬁrichtet euch!ﬂ
28
  You have to be, stay nicely, and you -- after 
you say, you can stay. Just like that and this -- I was mi xing up. I make always upside 

down. So you can imagine. They beat me  so much until in the end I understand already 
what they mean.  
 
Q: Why was the Appell so awful?   
 
A: The what?   
 
Q: Why was role call so --  
 
A: We ll, you know to take respect for the SS.  
 
Q: But why did people think this was such a terrible thing?   
 
A: They was the rules. Like you say, because Jews don't have right to live. The all day, you

listen, you hear, just what; ﬁIhr verfluchte Jude,
29
 dirty Jew, you Christus, you murder,ﬂ 
and all kind of things. I can't  remember all the things, but in the end they say always, you 
don't hear about, we was used to that. Okay. You talk because ma ybe in an hour they 
going to shoot us. Maybe in an hour we going to be dead. So we don't care about that.  
 
02:50:20 
 
We  never, never, never one mi nute never think about survive. And my, my policy, and I 

say always, ﬁI have to do all mi ne better. I have to try to survive.ﬂ And we was this 
struggling there was until January 18, January 1945 and 18 and 17, January, so we start 
already, we listen already, you know, the bombardme nt. So we say you, ﬁOh, oh, 

some thing's wrong.ﬂ and before you -- yes -- before you know, it was already alarm, fleet 
alarm the bomb, the American flyers comi ng and the Russian comi ng at night, American 
day. And was all day, you know, they destroy completely, the I.G. Farben. But the 

crematorium and the gas chamber, they never destroy because Churchill
30
 say this one is 
not a military object.  
 
Q: Let me  see, how we are doing on tape?   
 
A: The what.  
 
Q: I have to check on the tape.  
 
A: So ma ybe I don't have to say that.  
 
Q: No, no that's okay. Let's get back to the building part. Do you reme mber how you felt 
about the work you were doing?   
 
A: Yes. We  have all kind of work. First one was the old building was in concrete, okay. And 
I remember it was, trains come in with stones and sand because is not like today with the 
big trucks with the mi xer. We  have to ma ke ourselves, so my job was to put on the 
wagon stones. So much, so much stones, and so much, so much sand and there was two 

of them. We  have to push the wagon to the machine. We  have to turn the machine and to 
put the stones with the sand in a mi xer. Not a mi xer, but it was in back in big box and the 
guy what was working the machine was a German guy. He put the cement and he lift this 

in the machine and they mi x it. On the side was again two peoples like we was and the 
cement, the concrete fall in and we have to go with them to the building to the builders 
that build and -- to put like today, you know, the concrete fall down and they make it. It 

was a very, very hard job. This was my job, my job, and we have to go fast and 
sometimes the cement, they use very much cement and sometimes cement is comi ng, you

know, with trains. The same thing, except they comi ng at night at this time.  
 
02:53:50 
 
So, what do we hear, ﬁJuden raus
31
,ﬂ where we have to out from the block and five they 
count so much, so much, and we have to go to take out the cement from the trains, from 
the wagons. And I was, this time I was ma ybe, I don't reme mber, ma ybe 16 years, 15, 16 
years and you have to, you know, put on your shoulder in back of ceme nt sack, and it was 

over 100 pounds. And you have to run with that and some times when the Germans when 
the SS, they outside they start, ﬁschnell, schnell, schnell
32
.ﬂ They want to go home so 
they put two and you can't  run, so they hit us with the rifles. And one German, he hit 

ma ny, ma ny times and he smashed my kidney, and they have to take out the kidney. So I 
have just one kidney. But what can you do?  I couldn't say nothing because if some body 

doesn't  listen, if some body fall down with Œ so 
they call ﬁHey, take him.ﬂ If not, if he 
doesn't  want to, so he shoot him on the spot. You have them carried to the camp dead. So 

what -- I couldn't do nothing.  
 
Q: This is probably a strange question, but 
when they took out your kidney, was there any 
relief that you were in a hospital for a few days?   
 
A: But, no the kidney was removed after the war.  
 
Q: Oh. 
 
A: But, you know, I was suffering from the kidney in camp, but I was scared to go to the 
doctor at the camp because they send me to the gas chamber. But this one was in the 
beginning. But after -- so when you are already an old prisoner, you know a little bit the 
rules. So I couldn't ma nage to not go to this work first of all. Second one, you know, the 

camp was already built and the buildings was already built so, you know, we don't ma ke 
any cement. But in this time they start to make like professionals work. Electricians, 
carpenters, painting, because all everything have to be paint and you -- they make some 

peoples -- they have to work for the -- to put on the Skelett
33
, you know, for the building 
that™s from the ironwork, you know, the big things. So, you know, it was very, very hard, 
but we don't have to. We don't have to carry the cement, all this thing and first of all, and 
second, I was already an old prisoner so I know this rule. So we can ma nage, you know, 

to not to work so hard. So I manage to be an electrician.  
 
Q: Okay. I have got to stop you because I think we'r e out of tape. We 'll pick up when you 
become an electrician.

03:00:42 
 
Q: When we stopped we were talking about your work --  
 
A: Yeah, by the cement. When I went it was already a longer, little bit longer then camp. So 
we start to know the rules first of all. Second one, when I was 79,000 but at this time, 
after -- first of all, when the building was already finished. We was-- 
 
Q: Now which building was this?   
 
03:01:16 
 
A: Any kind of building. There was ma ny buildings and they start to bring in from the east 
like civil peoples. [Technical conversation] So -- and this time, this was maybe two years 

after, maybe, they start to bring in all kind of peoples Ostarbeiter
34
. That mean the people 
fr om east, like the French workers fr om Belgium, civilian workers. They was going in 

freiwillig
35
. That mean they go for themselves because they ma ke big propaganda ﬁCome 
to work for Germany. You going to be fine. You going to be good.ﬂ And the same  thing 

was from Poland, from France, from Belgium, from the Russian, from Ukraine, from all 
over, all over Europe and this Buna works and this Buna I.G. Farben industry they ma ke 

was at least one million of workers. We was in the concentration camp already, I don't 
know exactly, ma ybe 12 or 15,000, but you have and -- after this comi ng all the prisoners 
from war, from the English people, the American soldiers, the French sol-- you know 

they -- what was the prisoner from the war. There was -- they have on the back marked 
ﬁPY
36
,ﬂ prisoner of war. There was two there so, you know, this work, it was already -- I 
don't want to easy, but it was a little bit easy. And at this time I was already an old 

prisoner so I know the rules. So I don't want to work. It's too hard and I think sometimes 
in my mi nd I say myself, ﬁThe world have to finish once. Maybe, we going to be free or 

maybe we going to be dead.ﬂ So I say, ﬁI have to try to survive long as I can so I try not 
to work too much.ﬂ And I become  in a Komma ndo
37
. A Komma ndo, that mean every 
prisoner was to the Komma ndo, and Komma ndo does what kind of work?  Some  people 

was electricians, painters, was builders, was carpenters and I was younger this time, so I 
don't have no trade. So I have a Kapo
38
, you know, the Kapo. That me an it was he 
organize, not organize but he take care on a certain group of people for the work, like a 
ma nager for work. So I ask him, ﬁMaybe you want to take me  to your job,ﬂ because it 
was not so hard.

03:04:26 
 
So I was a Komma ndo 120 Œ 800 Œ 28. I was electric Komma ndo specialist, you know, 
the work was already little bit easy. First off all, I don't have to carry nothing but, you 
know, some times we have a pliers. Some times, you have a case and box with tools or 
little wire or little cable, and even when we have to pull cables there was a special 

Komma ndo, Komma ndo nine and they pull the cables, and there was that Komma ndo. 
There the peoples not survive no longer than four, five weeks.  
 
Q: Why was that?   
 
A: Because it was very hard. First, they were big cable and it was hard and they were very 
big. And the Kapo was very bad ma n. He was from Austria. But I never want to go. I take 

care always not to fall in, in this Komma ndo because that finished. So I in was 
Komma ndo 128. It was very -- not easy, but it was easy. And one day the chief of -- the 

German chief come  in and I was working with two Polish guys. They was in 
concentration camp too. But they was okay. So I was the helper. I have to help them. I 
was carry tools. I was carry the box and they was my chiefs, my ma nagers. So the chief 

come  in and say ﬁLook, you have to go in this, this place, you have to connect the cable 
to 4000 volt.ﬂ I remember very good.  
 
03:06:12 
 
So it was in, Tadek and we have to go there. And it was a big cable and there was a box, 
you know, for the fuses and it was the long fuse. And on the top there was power and on 
the end there was no power, because you have to put the fuse and you have to connect 
this cable. So we put the cable in this box and he say, ﬁYou know, what?  I'm going to 

push him. You push in and you ma ke the screws and we™ll be okay.ﬂ And so, he was 
stronger for me, and after the cable I screw a little bit. Not so much because I was not so 
strong like him. So he say, ﬁYou know what?  Now, you come  lift little bit the cable. I™m 

going to screw.ﬂ So I have -- the box was big -- I have my face always in the box and I 
keep this cable. And he took a key, a me tal key and turned the nuts, you know, to close it 
very fast. And in the mi ddle it turned and placed from down to up and from up to down, 

and it make a short and there was a flame and I have it all, everything in my face. The 
whole face was burned and he have, you know, split his hand and I think I was burning, 
so I wipe up and I take out all this meat, all the skin to the bones. It was, first of all, it 

was hell. So I look at him. So I say, ﬁTell me , what you do? ﬂ  When he saw me  he say, 
ﬁWe have to go some  place.ﬂ So we run to the comma nders place where the SS was there 
and we arrive there. So, I remember the SS, they say, ﬁWas hast du -- Icek, was hast du 

gemacht?ﬂ
39
  What you are doing?  So I say I was in -- meantime there was no power in 
the center there. So, they call to the -- we have in Krankenbau
40
 and like a little hospital, 
 
39
 ﬁW hat have you Œ Icek, what have you done? ﬂ (German) 
40
 Infirmery (German) 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
36 
 
and they say for me , ﬁHe was wounded -- he was burned. You have to come  and take 
him.ﬂ Because I can't  see any more, nothing. So -- but the SS still, they give me cigarette, 
ma ybe they have pity for me , I don't know. And it is comi ng with the table. Put me  on a 
table I went to the hospital and I was there. So I say -- it was a doctor, it was Polack -- I 

say ﬁLook, I hope I can go out tomorrow, day after tomorrow.ﬂ So he say, ﬁYou crazy?  
Even in 15 days, you can't  go out.ﬂ And, you know, every day the doctor come  and take 
out the dry skin. But I was so bad burned so they have to put me  some  place because 

Mengele come  in every time to looking after, and when he find me , he send me  to the gas 
chamber because I was very sick. So they hide me at certain time. I was covered with all 
kind of things -- he doesn't  see me . And I was in the hospital for ma ybe six weeks. After 

six weeks I come out and we start to work again. So no more electrician.  
 
Q: So they let you stay in the hospital six weeks and not many people they let stay six --  
 
A: Oh, no, oh, no. Because every day, every day you have peoples comi ng in truck and take 
them out and they send them to the gas chamber.  
 
Q: And these doctors were nice and they hid you?   
 
A: He didn't see me . I don't know how they ma nage it. But they -- because of, I don't know. 
Maybe they like me . Maybe I was lucky. And it was a very nice ma n. The doctor was 
very nice. He clean it every day. He take out the dry skin. It hurt very much.  
 
03:10:38 
 
Q: Now where was your brother at this point?   
 
A: My brother, he was in Birkenau. They take him away to Birkenau.  
 
Q: Did he start at Buna with you?   
 
A: He start at Buna with me and this I want to see before my accident. The burn accident. 
The transport from the same town when I was in Plonsk is comi ng, the next transport. It 

was my oldest brother come in and he took the place, the transport took the place from us 
in the quarantine. And in quarantine they find out one or two, they have typhus, and they 

take the whole transport and they send them to Birkenau. And they went -- most of them, 
80 or 90 percent from this -- they went to the gas chamber. And my brother was between 
them.  
 
03:11:49 
 
So we have to Œ you know, in column -- we was always -- all this was about four or five 

o'clock afternoon. When the war was finished, the day war was finished, we have to walk 
to the camp. We never walked when it was dark, not in the morning, not at night. We 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
37 
 
                                                          
have to come  into the camp when it was lights. So when I come  -- when my Komma ndo 
come  to the camp, so I saw the whole column from my brother and he saw me . He say 
me , he say me  ﬁGoodbye. We  doesn't  see you -- We  don't see us anymore.ﬂ And this was 
the end.  
 
Q: Your brother waved goodbye?   
 
03:12:40 
 
A: And my little brother was already in Birk
enau. He find, ma ybe next day he find his 
clothes.  
 
Q: Now, when you were building over at Buna, what were you building?   
 
A: Blocks, buildings, all kind of buildings. Because like I say --  
 
Q: Can you just begin that thought with, when
 we got to Buna we were building?   
 
A: First of all, we building the camp because it was not camp. It was just empty, not empty 
places, just a couple barracks. It was not the wires, the electrified wires. We have to build 
that. We put it --  
 
Q: The barracks?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Your own housing?   
 
A: We  have to ma ke that. And we ma de it because -- first of all, we ma ke the holes to put 
the Beton
41
, you know, around and after we have to pull the wires the, you know Œ how 
do you call -- what they make on the prisons, the wires. You can't  pass there, the wires. 

And after they have the wires electrify with -- I think, 220 volts around, and something 
we have to put on this one. We have to put barracks because every time, every time there 

was newcomers, newcomers like from all kinds of Jews. Most, they comi ng from all over 
from Greece, from Yugoslavia, from Belgium, from France, from all over, all over, all 
over, and we have to build a place for them. So this was the building. After, when the 

camp was built, so we went in certain group. We nt out to the Buna Œ work -- we start 
exactly the same thing to build it. Carpenters to prepare to make the things for, to make 
the Beton, the concrete, and some people like electricians to build all this building. And 

we have the masters, the masters -- the chiefs, they was Germans. Germans engineers, 
Germans architect, all the Germans was -- and we was just, we made just the dirty work, 
the hard work.  
 
41
 concrete (German) 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
38 
 
 
03:15:27 
 
Q: So you build your part of the camp?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then after all this was built, did you stay at Buna?   
 
A: I stay always at Buna, yes. Until the end. Until the 18th of January, 1945.  
 
Q: Because you were there at the beginning, did you have a good sense of the layout of the 
camp and how everything was organized?   
 
A: Layout of the camp, no. But one thing we know, we don™t going to survive there. They 
have to -- first of all, you know, when you fall sick, was finished. And they have to every 
day, every time, they have to kill in certain number fr om this prisoners. There was this 
policy, the German policy.  
 
Q: Did you work in the German industry as well?   
 
A: The whole camp was German industry.  
 
Q: But in the -- did you work in the coal mi nes?  Did you work in the munitions?  Did you 
work in the rubber ma king?   
 
A: We make, yes. I was working there and in the industry because it was our job. Like I say, 
I was working like electrician and we always have to be ready, because we make 
sometimes, you know, they have some trouble with the electricity. There was the, you 
know, how can I explain you?  It was in building 700, and this 700 they ma ke the gasoline 

for the planes and there was a roll, and under this it was like a carpet, long carpet. It was 
rolling and over there they put some, not coal, but cox.  
 
03:17:53 
 
You know what cox?  Cox is coal. You take out the coal Œ you take out the gas from them 
and from them they took out, they ma ke gasoline and this have to run the whole day. You 
put it in the machine to take out the stuff, and we have to always take care of that, to 
repair. Sometimes it was mi ssing. Sometimes it doesn't  work. Sometimes it was a fuse 

was burned up or some thing like that, and we have to be always there. They run 24 hours 
a day. So this one is the job I was working there.  
 
Q: How long were you in that job?

A: This was ma ybe about two years.  
 
Q: How ma ny workers were over there?   
 
A: In this whole company, they all I.G. Farben industry, was about, I can't  lie to you, about a 
million something, a million people.  
 
Q: In the part where you were working?   
 
A: The part I was working was about, ma ybe 35 peoples. Just my Komma ndo for me . This 
was just the prisoners.  
 
Q: We re there wome n working at Buna?   
 
A: No, no, no. There was wome n, yes. But there was no prisoners with us. There was the 
civil workers, the Ost
42
 workers from east, from east, from Poland, from Ukraine, from 
Russian, and some times there was even the prisoners from the war, from American 
prisoners, English prisoners, Australian prisoners. They all take part in the war. They was 
there in this I.G. Farben industry.  
 
Q: And you're calling all these prisoners of war?  These civilian workers, even though they 
were prisoners of war?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how was this organized?  You did certain job and they did certain jobs?   
 
A: Yes. We  have -- first of all, we don't have no right to speak with any kind of civil 
workma n. When is a German we have like chief German, German chiefs, like architects, 
like engineers.  
 
03:20:25 
 
When these spoke there was a Kapo, they take care of us. So he was talking with him and 
he give us orders, but personal. I don't have no right to talk with any kind of civil worker, 
any kind of civil business. Nothing. If they catch me , they hang us, you know. We  have 
every day, every day there was before supper, supper what we have. We  come  in, and we 

saw already the thing was ma de and today th ey going to hang one or three or five or 
something. I remember, there was one bombardment and there was a young man -- I don't 
remember how old he was --  He eat his piece of bread that he receive for breakfast, and 

the German SS take them and they put him in jail. They make a jail, a hole. They put him 
in jail and the next day they hang him, and because they say he was stealing bread. And

time from the bombardme nt was not good, and I reme mber young ma n was ma ybe 17, 
18-years-old, he begging them officers Œ Ober
sturmbannführer -- and they begging him, 
they kiss his boot, ﬁPlease, it™s not true, I don't do nothing.ﬂ He doesn™t help, absolute 

nothing. They put him on -- they put his cut on his neck and he poor guy, he couldn't die. 

There was a guy -- a Rackers
43
, terrible bitch an German, took his feet and pull him so 
down to die fast. And this one was the order for the day was, ma ybe every day, every 
second day. One day we comi ng up, we comi ng to the camp after the work and they saw 
already, in each place from the Appellplatz was the German with the rifle, with the 

machine gun, and we say, ﬁOh, oh, some thing happen.ﬂ And three young boys was 
hanging because he say they want to escape from the camp. That wasn't  true and they 
hang him. So I reme mber one scream, ﬁKopf hoch, Kame rad!ﬂ

 -- he say, ﬁup his headﬂ -- 
ﬁwe are the last one.ﬂ And the last one he say, ﬁLeben die Freiheit!ﬂ
46
 ﬁlong life and 
liberty.ﬂ They hang three young peoples for what?  Did exactly the same thing, pull them 
by the legs because they couldn't die. And some times even to die, even to hang, you have 
to know how to hang. And some times, you know, you have to -- they think, you know, 

they have to put it here just to break the neck. But he just put on the thing and put here. 
This guy don't know how the neck, so he pull on the legs to die. How did they do that?   
 
Q: What were you thinking as all of this is happening?   
 
A: Every day, every day, every day was the same  thing. Every day we saw it and some times, 
some  days, we talking about it and I have it before my eyes. I saw the young boys, and 

after we have to ma rch, you know. You know was about 12 or 15,000 peoples, I don't 
reme mber. We  have to pass by them and have to look on them, how they hang dead. 

Something terrible.  
 
03:25:28 
 
Q: Did you feel terribly isolated?   
 
A: You see in a moment there -- sometimes I wake up at night, you see, 50 years after and I 
say, it was impossible. Is dream. I dream about that, but it's impossible that things happen 
in the 20th century and peoples, like Germany, they are cultivated people. So organized 
people doing things like that. It is something impossible. When the-- you know,

liquidated the ghetto there was the German to go to take out the peoples, took the little 
children, little babies by their feet and they smash their heads on the wall and -- and the 
governme nt doesn't  know, the United States governme nt don't know, the governme nt 
from England doesn™t know -- they know everything but nobody lift their little finger, 

because maybe, because they are Jews, but maybe -- they don't kill not just Jews. They 
have Christian too. And nobody, nobody lift. Nobody say one word because, you know, 
and God, where was God?  God. And the Germans have this belt was ma rked God, God is 

with us. The Germans not with us. They kill people. They kill rabbis. They kill priests. 
They kill everybody. Where was God?   
 
Q: Where did you think God was at the time?  Did you think there was a God?   
 
A: No. Even not today, no. Look at what happened. That still, but still is not ma ybe a 
Holocaust, but they kill. They still kill all those people. Why? Why did they kill? Okay. I 

going to say they kill the oldest people, ma ybe they going to do some thing, but the young 
babies, the old men -- I had an uncle he was over 100 years. They kill him. Why?   
 
03:27:54 
 
Q: Do you reme mber if you prayed at all when you were in the camp?  Did you pray?   
 
A: Did I pray?   
 
Q: Did you pray?   
 
A: Pray to who?  No, no. Even not today, no! Because to who I going to pray? To kill me  a 
little bit faster?  I like to believe Œ I like to believe, I'm a Jew 100 percent. There is no 
question. But pray for who?  For who?  Where is he?  What to do?  God, I see with my 
eyes. We was wondering there was a priest, an older priest and he fall on his knees by the 

Saint Maria in Poland. You know, there was the Christ and all these things, and a 
German come  in, a young German kill him on the spot. And there is nothing there. Even 
this guy should -- his hand should be paralyzed and, you going to tell me there is a God?  

There is a priest. There is a Pope, all these things, but, nothing is not true. Is nothing 
there. Even today in the 21st century we believe, make such a thing as murders, killing 
little babies, little children. Why? What differen
ce? Jew, not Jew? We all the same. They 
have the same  blood. Why?  Who you going to ask?  Who you going to ask?  Who we 
going to ask?  Stop it. What are you going to say?  I have the same  thing.  
 
Q: Let me  ask you, was there -- did you ever feel like you would get out of there?   
 
A: No, no. I know once in 1945 in 18 of January. So we don't go out no day before. Two 
days before, we don't go out to work. The Komma ndos were a little, you know, some  no 

problem, but the Germans was very hard, so I say, ﬁUh-oh, some thing happen.ﬂ And this 
time they start to ma ke the bombardme nt on the camp. You know, the I.G. Farben was 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017

bombarded. The repair was bombarded. It was some thing. So on the 18 of January there 
was an order, we have to go together and we was out. The camp was liquidated and the 
Buna. We  have to go out. So we was walking the whole night until a certain camp, 
Gleiwitz.  
 
03:31:03 
 
So we was in camp. We  went to the camp. We  stay over night and the next day they 

come  in. We  have to go to the train station. And in this gruppe
47
, I was most of the last 
one. And we have to take out the peoples what was first in the Krankenhaus
48
, in hospital 
there. So we have peoples. There was a little, not all young. They was a little sick, you 
know, and we have to take them out, and they sit outside the place. It was -- I saw was 
one or two SS, they shoot them, they shoot all those people. There was a river from 

blood. I couldn't -- we go to the station and they put us in trains, you know that. They put 
in the beast, you know, the cows. They put us in the trains, and it was ma ybe eight days 
long. It was a ride ma ybe eight kilome ters up and down, up and down, and everything 

was closed. We  don't have no water. It was wintertime, no water, no food, nothing, but in 
the trains, in the wagons there was a -- you know, between the wood was little bit open. 
So we have the air. So we comi ng back to Gleiwitz and I was hearing an order is comi ng 

from the Germans, and they say, ﬁSS abrücken, Häftlinge stehenlassen.ﬂ
49
   
 
03:33:03 
 
So the SS have to go away but they have to leave the prisoners in the wagons. So one 

officer say, ﬁNo, we have to take the prisoners with us. They was a -- they going to 
protect us.ﬂ And they open the wagon with the machine rifle they start to shoot them. I 
have just one. I received here. I don't know if you can see. (Indicating.)  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: So I fell down and have to roll. I don't know how long. I don't reme mber because it was 
just shooting and lots of dead, and we was walking in the bushes, and from both sides the 
SS with machine rifles they shoot. It was lots of people run away, run to the bushes. I 
don't know if they catch them or kill them. And we are were wandering the whole night. 

We were walking until the next day. We come in the morning. We come in the prison, 
and we fe ll on the fl oors, and we sleep on the fl oor until next day. Next day we have to 
walk. And we walk 2000 kilome ters from 18 of January until ninth of May, 1945. And 

we was by streets, all kind of towns, and some times we have a place to stay, in place one 
day. One day -- it was in March -- we come in a place. I don't remember anymore the 
place, and there it was, a camp just for the Polish people. I don't know if it was

concentration, if it was a work camp. And so the SS, I hear what they say, ﬁWe going put 
the prisoners there and we going to have a rest for one or two days.ﬂ Because, I think, 
they was tired, too. But the chief in the camp, he doesn™t want to let us in. And in this 
town it was a mountain, a little mountain and they make a tunnel -- you know what a 

tunnel is -- in case the fliers come  in to bomb. And so the people from this town can go in 
and to be safe, but it doesn't  ma ke it right through. And the chief say, ﬁOkay, we going to 
put the prisoners over there.ﬂ They put us there and it was not so very high and so it was 

cold. Everybody go on the end but it was closed. You couldn't go nowhere because it was 
not finished, it was not finished.  
 
03:36:27 
 
The compress us. All the things was outside, so I went there too, and it was a little warm 
but after I say, ﬁIs little bit but no air. I want to go in the fr ont.ﬂ And they wanting the 
chief, the comma ndant in this camp. They ma ke soup, you know, liquid soup. So I have it 
was a part with me, and I say I going to go in the front every time and I going to take a 

little bit. I have to eat, so I take one and I say I going to take one, and I have a nice time. 
In meantime we start to mi ssing air in the end, no air, no air, and everybody want to go in 
the front. So like here, you have the door. When you open the door, it was a place -- 

ﬁThis one for me  -- a good place, I gonna go there, I go to hide there. Nobody going to 
see me  and I have the fresh air.ﬂ And the front was two SS and every time when the 
peoples want to go to the front, they shoot them. They kill them and they kill lots of 

peoples. And they put in -- there was a wagon outside and they put a wagon in front so 
nobody can go in. What I going to tell you?  I can't  describe it. There was screaming and 
crying and the peoples, they running to the walls. They licked the walls because it was 

wet from the no air, and you see the oxide comi ng out. It was there in March. It was 
about six o'clock. It was dark and the front was the SS. They let nobody out. We  have to 
stay inside until the next day in the morning, and the morning was lights come in, maybe 

eight o'clock and they called all the SS to come in, and they let out the people that was 
still alive, and the firework was comi ng. They couldn't go in. They had to take the gas 
ma sk, they couldn™t go in the end and from the end they took out peoples there. Dead. 

Maybe 100, 150 people was dead. And some  peoples could survive on the end, comi ng 
out after five, six mi nutes they outside, they fell down and die because the lungs, they 
couldn't support.  
 
03:39:26 
 
And I was there ma ybe couple days, and they took the dead peoples put between the 

barracks outside, they all frozen. Food, no question about food for us there. And about 
eight days later we have to go away. And we start again to walk, and the order was to 
shoot the people, to kill us. But they couldn't kill us in town because it civil people there 

and they couldn't -- they doesn't  want to give us to deliver to the Russian, because the 
Russians comi ng from the other side. And they don't want to give us to the American 
soldier, but the American was too far. So we was between and we was walking every

44 
 
                                                          
day. Every day we was walking. It was a couple SS and they pull out peoples and they 
shoot. So I say, ﬁGod, some thing happen. I won't survive.ﬂ So I have -- on my side it was 
a little SS. He was -- I don't know if he was from Yugoslavia, an older ma n, ma ybe 60, 
ma ybe more, and he have on backsack. So I say to him, ﬁLook, you not a young ma n. 

You know what?  Give me  your back. I going to carry them.ﬂ So he say, ﬁWhy you want 
to do that? ﬂ   ﬁI want to help you. You tired. I want to help you. I think that's good.ﬂ So he 
take out -- he give me the thing he was walking just on the side from me. So every time 

they eat, they have food, they have bread, so he give me  just a piece of bread for me . It 
was good and I can walk, first of all. Second, I was sure no SS going to come  and grab 
me to kill me because I have his things, and he going to take care of it because he want 

already Œ I have Œ SS they want to come  in and grab me  he say, ﬁUh-oh, don't touch it™s 
mi ne.ﬂ So I was already okay, and when I was doing that so ma ny peoples, not ma ny 
have prisoners like me to do that. There was about five, six that we carried the SS sack. 

And in summe rtime, so we find a wagon. We  put all these goods from the Germans, from 
the SS, on the wagon, and we was pushing the wagon. And we was okay. We  didn't have 
food, but at least I was sure -- I was not sure -- but I was sure I was going to live until 

night. I don't know what going to be next day. So they put us in all kind of place to sleep, 
and in the morning we see one dead on one side, one dead on other side Œ the people 
dying like nothing. And it comi ng May 9, 1945 about seven, eight o'clock in the morning, 

and it was not far from Friedland in Sudetenland. There was still a little SS come into me 
and took me  by the arm.  
 
03:42:45 
 
He say to me  in German, ﬁGo hin
50
, where you wollt
51
, aber lasst euch ja nicht erwischen 
bei unsere Brüder.ﬂ
52
  ﬁGo where you want, but take care the Germans doesn't  catch 
you.ﬂ And this was my liberation. The Russian come  in there and this was May 1945, and 

I was with my friend from Holland. My fr iend and we was running, running, and we saw 
already, you know, the Germans was sitting the rifles and all these things, all on the side. 

No more. And one mome nt everybody who running -- the Germans was running, all the 
soldiers was running. So I was on the highway and I stay and I wasn't  German, and I say, 
ﬁHey, why you running so fast? ﬂ   So he say, ﬁFast, fast, Ivan come !ﬂ  And the Russian 

comi ng, this was the liberation. He was lucky he was the first officer that I saw. It was a 
Jew, Russian, Jew, Russian, and this when was the liberation. So you can imagine.  
 
Q: Could you believe this was really true?   
 
A: No, and the first thing that he say, ﬁYou go back about five or 10 kilome ters because here 
we have to find, it still the Hitlerjugend
53
ﬂ -- was still in the bushes was hiding and Œ ﬁwe 
have to clean it up.ﬂ But this was impossible -- I couldn't believe it. I was at this time, I

was ma ybe 30 kilos, about 60 pounds and eating -- I don't have eat maybe, one or two 
weeks and it was very hard not to eat, but in this time, you know, the snow, there, it was 
me lted, it was blackened, and this is what we ate. This was our nourishment.  
 
Q: You ate the snow?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, did the Russians then come  back and take care of you?   
 
03:45:28 
 
A: Yeah. The Russian was there and we going back, and I was -- we went to Ringelshain in 
this one -- in Sudetenland, you know, and Czechoslovakia and I was there. I was there a 

little time and I don't know nothing about my brothers. Because all this time I think 
ma ybe they are all dead. So one thing that happened, you know, there was lots of people, 

watch us passing in this town, and so there was boy. He was passing and I was talking 
with him. So I told, I ask him, ﬁWhere you going? ™  So he say ﬁOh, I don't want to stay 
here. I go to Germany. From Germany I go to Belgium.ﬂ And I say, ﬁMaybe, ma ybe, you 

saw my brother.ﬂ I don't know. But this guy he went like say, he say, he went to Germany 
and from Germany he went to Belgium and he go exactly the same  place where my 
brother was. So the same thing I ask him a
nd so he say, ﬁI saw your brother. Yes, your 
brother is dead.ﬂ So, I receive a letter from him. I receive a letter, I say, ﬁI don't have 
nothing to do here.ﬂ So from Czechoslovakia I went to Germany and I go to Munich, to 
Germany, and when I arrive there so, you know, we have all over friend. I have all over 

people I know from camp. So I saw one, he say ﬁAye, look, your brother is looking after 
you.ﬂ ﬁMy brother is looking after me ? ﬂ   He say, ﬁyes.ﬂ ﬁHow is looking, my brother? ﬂ  
He describe me completely like my older brother is -- he went to gas chambers Œ so I say, 

ﬁLook, I think you ma de a mi stake.ﬂ And he say, ﬁNo, I don't ma ke a mi stake, I think 
he™s younger from you.ﬂ He told me , ﬁand is that and that and that.ﬂ ﬁYou have the 
address? ﬂ  And he say ﬁNo, I don't have the address.ﬂ So we took a taxi. We  run the 

whole day over all Munich and that night I 
find him, and he doesn™t know from me , and 
he doesn™t know from me  from my brother -- that was in Belgium. And I said ﬁLook, 

Aaron is alive and is there and there.ﬂ And we send him a telegram. He went from 

Belgium. He come  to Munich, to Germany and from Germany went to Belgium. We  were 
all three together, and after my two brothers, they went to Israel. From Israel they went to 
Belgium and from Belgium to Canada and here I am.  
 
03:48:24 
 
Q: So the three of you were together?   
 
A: Yes.

Q: And how come  you didn't go with them?   
 
A: Because I was married in Belgium.  
 
Q: Did you have a difficult time getting to Canada?   
 
A: I don't have no difficult in Canada, but I have very much difficult in Belgium, yes. 
Because they ask me  always papers Œ and we don™t have no papers -- you couldn't stay in 
Belgium. And we want to stay in Belgium. We  don't have no right to work, no have to 
right to ma ke business, and every three months we have to go to the police. And, you 

know, to present, to say, ﬁI'm here,ﬂ and always was the same  question. ﬁWhat you doing 
here?  And why you stay here? ﬂ   So the one thing I say is, ﬁfor the mome nt I want to here, 
but we want to go to Israel, to Palestine.ﬂ And he gave me , you know, for three months 

and again for three months and -- but before, when we arrived in Belgium, we was in a 
home for old peoples, like an orphan house, but it is not for young but was already old, 
17, 18 years. But before that we have was ma ybe, you know, Namur.  
 
03:50:23 
 
Namur was a priest, a very, very good ma n, a very fine ma n, and have trouble with the 

police because they doesn't  want to let us be there. So the gendarmes, the Belgium 
gendarmes they want to take out to pass the border. So they took one, they put on the 
truck, and time they want to take someone else. They escaped. It was the priest. He say, 

ﬁStop. I going to take all.ﬂ So he took all the peoples in the church. Jewish people went 
all there until a Jewish chaplain from the American Army, he know about that, and he 
took the Œ all this people, Brux-- Linkebeek.  
 
03:51:25 
 
And it was a home there. It was in Linkebeek in this home, and we was support by the 

Jewish committee until a certain time. After they liquidate this home and everybody have 
to go to work, but we have some  trouble with the work and we need an carte d™identité

just use fingerprints. And we have trouble to stay there. We never could be a Belgium 
citizen. So the best way is to go out. And we start, you know, to ma ke the registration to 
Australia, to New Zealand, and to Canada. So the first thing my brother, the younger 
brother, went to Canada here and after we come .  
 
Q: But I thought he was already in Israel.  
 
A: No. From Israel he come , you know, he ma ke his service, military service.  
 
Q: He came back?  
 
A: Came  back from Belgium. He come  here to Canada.  
 
Q: So you applied to various countries and Canada accepted you first?   
 
A: Yes. Now Canada is my home.  
 
Q: We re you in the DP camp in Czechoslovakia long?   
 
A: There was no camp.  
 
Q: There wasn't  a camp?  
 
A: No, I was not in camp. I was in private home. I was in Czechoslovakia, about a year, a 
year and a half because I have to find somebody. I couldn't imagine the whole family, 
nobody dead. So I travel. I want to go to Poland but when I come  to Polish, on the border, 
Polish-Czechoslovakia they start to take us to the army. So I say, ﬁHold it, stop. First of 

all, I can't  kill nobody. Second, I am no good for the army. I was already five year in the 
concentration camp.ﬂ Not for me, the army. So, I remember very well. It was the German 
prisoners, the sick, wounded prisoners that was from the war. They was in train this pass 

from Poland and Poland Czechoslovakia and most of prisoners from the Russian front 
from the German. They pass Czechoslovakia, Poland, Czechoslovakia. So the first thing 
at night there was a train. I jump on the train and I went in Czechoslovakia because 

Czechoslovakia was the maybe, is today I don't know, it was the one civilized country 
from the old eastern country. First of all, no antisemite is there. There are very, very fine 
people. There are today very fine people, very good, and they help lot, they help. Red 

Cross, they help me  and after I went to UNRRA and I was very good there. But soon I 
receive a letter from my brothers. I say and the same thing and this time, you know, I 
don't know if you know, Masaryk
55
 was the president fr om Czechoslovakia, he kill 
himself and this started the trouble with the Communists.

And I say, ﬁI'm not a Communist. I was in diktature
56
 already long enough. I want to be 
free. I want to freedom so nobody can tell me  what I do, what I -- nobody can do what I 
have to say. What I have to do, what I have to say. I want out.ﬂ So, the first thing that I 
do, I take my friend and we went to Prague and in Prague was just -- you know, I listen 

by the radio. It was the Nuremberg process. So they make the process and the next day 
we smuggle the border, and we arrive to Germany and then München, you know -- not 
München, but it was in We st Germany. And from the We st Germany I say, ﬁNow I am in 

a democratic country.ﬂ The American was there. I don't care but I don't stay not long, 
because we went to Belgium. Belgium we have trouble but the government doesn™t let us 
there.  
 
Q: You're with your brother at this point?   
 
A: I was always with my brothers, yes. And that's the way was. Look, we go to United States

Q: I'd just like to finish up what we were talking about earlier, which was I was asking you 
how the Russians who liberated you, how they treated you.  
 
A: Very, very good. First of all, they know already because before they comi ng to us, they 
pass already Auschwitz and Buna there, and the whole way that they ma ke from the 
Russian country ‚til us. They liberated 100 different prisons and they saw all of that, and 
they saw the crematoriums, they saw all these things. So when they arrived on us, they 

saw this. They know about us. They know, and I reme mber when the Russian arrived, the 
officer, the first thing what he gave me  a piece of bread. And he have a motorcycle and 
he told me , ﬁYou know what?  You sit on the side car. You going show me  all the 

Germans that kill, that was bad.ﬂ And, you know, it was the first soldier that comi ng and 
it was always with motorcycle and on this motorcycle was a machine gun. And, you 
know, they was in the mi ddle and all the soldiers, the German soldiers have to be on the 

side because, you know, they was the Russian soldiers come  in, and they took them all to 
the camp. And I, so far I remember, I was Œ gun -- I saw a gun and I start to play with it 
and the gun start to shoot, and maybe I kill some Germans. I don't know.  
 
Q: Did you want to?   
 
A: No. I can't  watch them. I know it was and I say, ﬁHey, hey, stop it. I don't know how to 
stop it.ﬂ But it doesn™t take time, it was so fast. And I remember we comi ng back, I don™t 
know if he was talking Russian. Meantime, they take away all the Germans, all the SS 
with the Germans, they took to the camp.  
 
Q: What camp did they take them to?   
 
04:03:45 
 
A: The prisoner camp, and after they separate them, SS one camp the Wehrmacht
57
 in 
second camp, and the wome n was to the SS wome n was– and I reme mber it was an 
officer with a motorcycle come  in. He want to pass, and on his motorcycle have a 
machine gun. So the Russians, the Russian officer, he say, ﬁhey stop, go down and come  

in.ﬂ And the officer was saying -- and he talk to his soldiers, ﬁTake him, bring him there.ﬂ 
He doesn't  want to. He stay up. He want to take the gun, so they kill him. They shoot him 
and the first thing that I do -- I have no shoes -- so I take his boots. They were beautiful, 

nice boots, and I take his boots and I look in his pocket. Maybe he have bread or 
something like that. So I take -- and I find a piece of bread and a piece of soap. The first

time. So the Germans, they give us, you know, machorka
58
, it was the tabek
59
 -- to things 
-- and bread, and we have some  meat. Not meat, but salami , the Russian salami . And they 
say, ﬁgo backﬂ and we went back. So we went back ma ybe about 10 kilome ters, back. We  
have meantime, I have a car. I have a horse. I have a bicycle. I have a car. I don't know 

how to drive, but I drive a car a little bit. But so far, so long we have gasoline. We don't 
have no gasoline, and after I have a horse, but the horse was more tired than me so I leave 
it there, until I have a bicycle. And we went to a town, a town called Ringelshain and I 

saw a little house on the mountain.  
 
04:05:48 
 
And I say to my friend Jackie, I say, ﬁYou know what, Jackie, we are going up there. We  

are going to try to pass the night over there, but here on the road is going to be very noisy 
because the army pass.ﬂ And so he say, ﬁokay.ﬂ So we go up the little hill and it was a 
little house, and we knocked. There was two old, one ma n and one woma n and I was 

maybe crazy, not crazy but I very polite, and they were German too. And I say, ﬁI'm 
sorry, we comi ng from concentration camp. We ™re very tired -- so, maybe we can pass 
the night here?  I don't want to stay here, but maybe you have a shed or something like 

that? ﬂ   So he told us, ﬁLook, we are not farmers. We  don't have nothing. But thereﬂ -- he 
show me over there -- ﬁis a big farm, over there you can go and you can pass.ﬂ In 
meantime there was a young lady stick out her head and she say, ﬁHey, hey, come here. 

How you talk?  You speak Russian? ﬂ   So, I say, ﬁYes.ﬂ But you believe me , at this time 
believe me or not, but at this time I was talking about -- speaking about seven language. 
But I was with all kind of people. We  have French -- not English -- French and Russian 

and Yugoslav. All kind of the slavish tongue, and we have Hungarian. We  have Greek. 
And this all you have to understood all together, so for each language you take a couple 
words and you learn. So I say, ﬁyes.ﬂ So she say, ﬁYou want to come  in because some  

Russian come  in and they ma ke us some  trouble, and we can't  speak with them. Maybe 
you can speak with them.ﬂ So we go in and first of all, we was so dirty. So we have to go 
and wash up and they give us, I remember she start to cut bread, but little slices. So I say, 

ﬁOh, no. That™s not for us.ﬂ I took a big slice of bread. And the first time after so many 
years, I sleep in a good bed. And the next day we go out and we were looking for brother, 
ma ybe a sister. Maybe was and we went to the Russian comma ndant too, and they give 

us all kind of things too and it was very, very nice. Very good.  
 
04:08:45 
 
Q: Let me  just go back a mi nute to the camp and ask you a few questions. One is, when you 
were in Buna, did you have much connection with or much knowledge about was 
happening in the rest of the complex?

A: What?  
 
Q: In Birkenau?  
 
A: Yes. We  have all the news. We  have all the news because it was every day, every day 
was the same  thing. Because first, you know, Mengele was, most of time, he was in he 
was camp in the morning, when we was ma rching out from camp to work he was there. 
He was there with a little stick, you know, and when he showing some body, ﬁthis guy 

have to be take out,ﬂ and he went, you know, in a special block and they put them, they 
put all of them. There was the bed, three beds, but they took out the wood between and 
they close them like a box. Inside they put in these people and the next day they come, 

you know, with the truck and to put all these people in that. They want to send to the gas 
chamber. So we know that because we knew every day, every day. It is not just sick 
people. Even the healthy peoples.  
 
Q: But did you know sort of what the structure of the other camps were or did people come 
from those camps to you and tell you what it was like at the different camps?   
 
04:10:44 
 
A: Yes. My brother, when he was taken away from Auschwitz they send him to 
Jawischowitz, and Jawischowitz was a coal mi ne. Now, in Buna, if some body have a bad 
record, like in Kapo, you know, a Kapo he went to the jail, to the SS, and say ﬁlook, this 
guy is not a good worker,ﬂ or some thing like that. So he doesn't  kill him, but they send 

him to a very hard job and in the coal mi nes. They have, you know, it was punishme nt. 
So they send him for eight days -- not eight days, ma ybe three weeks, four weeks in coal 
mi ne. In coal mi ne like my brother told me , he was there, he was working on his belly, so 

deep, they have to shovel the coals it was so deep. So it was very, very hard. And how I 
know?  Because this guy, he was strong, so he survive. And after surviving he come  back 
to us and he give me  news. He say, ﬁLook, I saw your brother. Your brother is in 

Jawischowitz. He work there.ﬂ So I ma ke all my possible. He was a guy, he was Erwin, 
called him -- he was an Altreich
60
 Jew. 
   
04:12:07 
 
He was an Rapport-Schreiber
61
. He was working in the offi ce with the German for the 
worker. If some body change the comma nder or some body go from one block -- the first 

thing, I was in block four. After they send me  to block 14. After from block 14 they send 
me  to block 51. And this was the, like I say, an accountant. And they ma ke all the 

paperwork. So I was talking with him, and I tell him -- I beg him, ﬁLook, I have my 
brother. He was working there and there and ma ybe you can do some thing. Maybe try.ﬂ

So he promised me . I say, ﬁMy brother™s a barber. He, you know, he going to shave you.ﬂ 
I promise all kind of thing, so he say ﬁI going to try to do that.ﬂ So he so that,  So he 
make him like an electrician, special electrician, special. So, I think it was end of 1943. 
My brother come  to my camp in Buna camp. I was in Buna and he was the same  

electrician. I was electrician. He was elect
rician, so you can imagine what kind of 
electrician we was there. So these people they told us everything that happened there, like 
some people comi ng from Birkenau, they took every time to put is called a 

Sonderkomma ndo
62
. That mean, I don't remember exactly how many, but these people, 
they took out when the people was gassed dead in the gas chamber. They took out these 
people, put them on the wagon and push them to the oven. But these people don't do long 
time because -- I'm sorry -- they put out the dead peoples and they put on the wagon. And 

most of them, they put two me n and one wome n because the wome n, they burn faster and 
better for me n. And they put them off a little wagon and they push them in the oven to be 
burned. And these people doesn™t work long. Maybe after two weeks, they are gassed, 

killed, because they don't want nobody to have to live. Can't tell nobody what happened, 
so they kill them. And we know that. Then they have special peoples. They was very 
good traitor. They received very good food, but eight days later, two weeks later, they 

have to go, and they took some body else. And we know that. Exactly the same  thing. 
They took the Russian prisoners, the wome n prisoners. They took out the ma rrow from 
the bones to put to inject the German soldiers. We know that. The experiments, because 

something the doctors tell us the same thing.  
 
04:15:52 
 
Q: The doctors told you?   
 
A: They talk together and they have peoples, like I say, they go into this camp to take the 
clothes from the dead, because they don't have so ma ny. But in the end, like 1945, 
beginning -- not '45 but mi ddle '44, so before the end '44, we don't have any uniforms, 
like with the stripes. They don't have anymore. So we have civilian clothes, but we have 

to put a patch on the back so you know yellow or other kind of patch. So they know they 
are prisoners.  
 
Q: You were in the hospital for a long time. We re you aware of any me dical 
experimentation?   
 
A: No. In Buna there was no medical experiments because the hospital was not very big. But 
once I remember, I was passing there, and I saw it was a very special place where they 

put the dead peoples there, and I saw two doctors. I can say it was Mengele and 
some body else and they was playing with human brains. The door was open, there was 

human brains.

Q: You saw this?   
 
A: I saw it with my eyes, yes.  
 
Q: Could you hear what they were talking about?   
 
A: I have to run away because I was scared for them. They was looking for pistol or for gun 
or something like that.  
 
04:17:47 
 
And once when my brother come  in camp, you know, from Jawischowitz into my camp -- 
he was a muselman
63
. He was very skinny, and so I try to help him. So he was working 
for the Komma ndo, for the Luftgaukomma ndo
64
 -- that mean they make the graves and 
the holes in the special machine guns against the planes, and they receive very good food, 
the Germans -- but he was in the commander and they have a couple men with him. And 
the Germans received this food. But always in the cans they leave a little bit of soup and 

before these cans have to go back to the camp they have to be washed. So they give him, 
they say, ﬁHey, you, you come  here. Take the soup but wash the cans.ﬂ But the cans was 
washed with iron brushes, and he was always hungry, he doesn't  see -- so ate the soup 

and he swallowed a piece of wire. One Sunday he come  to me  and he say he was -- it was 
after, so you have to be a barber and so he shave this guy and some body else and he say, 
ﬁI have such a pains in my stomach. I don't know what happened. I have lots of pains.ﬂ 

So I say, ﬁYou know what, come , I go with you to the hospital.ﬂ But I know this chief of 
the doctors for the hospital. So, I say ﬁStefanﬂ -- he was a Polack -- ﬁStefan, look, my 
brother have pains. You come see something.ﬂ So he put him on a bench like that there. 

Wa s ma ny doctors comi ng in and he was saying appendix. He had such big pains, so they 
put him at night -- not at night -- to operate
 him and I was on the other side. I was hiding 
but I saw everything that happened. So it was Dr. Mengele's, because even between the 
prisoners, there was some  good doctors and they worked in this hospital. And they want 
to operate him, so they open the belly. In meantime everything was open. There was an 
alarm, you know, the planes. I don't know if English or Russian planes come  in. No 

lights. He was laying down with open stomach. It just take I don't know, very long but 
the lights comi ng back. And the doctors comi ng back. I was behind. I saw that. I saw Dr. 
Mengele come  into him and say on his shoulder, ﬁJude, when you live now, you going to 

live long time.ﬂ And they operate on him. But they pull out all the intestine together very 
badly and he have very big trouble today, and they can do absolute nothing. Even when 
eat a little bit too much, they have to put him to the hospital, they have to take out 

everything. He was very, very sick.

04:21:19 
 
Q: But were you aware of any other weird medical experimentation in the camp?   
 
A: By us, I can't  say, no. And I was scared. I never want to go there because I have enough, 
and I was burned because everything was gone. So I don't want to know. I don't want to 
go there.  
 
Q: So you really didn't know that there was much medical --  
 
A: I know that they ma ke some  but I don't think so that they ma ke by us, no. But I know 
they ma ke with the Gypsies. I know because
 -- and I know they ma ke with the Russians 

ladies, the prisoners. I know from the Jewish people, Jewish woma n, they was sterilized.  
 
Q: How did you know this?   
 
A: They told me after the war.  
 
Q: How did they know?   
 
A: The Jewish wome n, they alive today. They have in Canada and Montreal. I have one. 
They can't  have no children and -- .  
 
Q: So this was information you got later on?   
 
A: In camp. I have from people that comi ng from Auschwitz, and Birkenau and the other 
camp because --  
 
Q: Did anyone say, ﬁI have had some  injections? ﬂ   
 
A: No, no, no. Like I say, I have an injection in my breast. It was so thick. What that mean 
this time, I don't know. What kind of injection and I have experience with my tooth. 

What this means, I don™t know. 
 
Q: You don't know what it means?   
 
A: It was take a little time and it was gone. Maybe some people have a reaction, but I don't 
know. I don't know because there was so ma ny peoples.  
 
Q: So they gave you an injection. You don't know what it was?  And a few days later you 
were okay. 
 
A: I couldn't -- and because if I ask, I have a slap in the face.  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
55 
 
Q: They didn't say, ﬁWe're giving you a shot for the flu? ﬂ  
 
A: No, no, no. They never, never say for what. But we know, we have an injection and 
ma ybe one or two days we going to die. If not, lucky for me .  
 
Q: So they just said, ﬁCome, we'r e going to give you a shot? ﬂ   
 
A: They say, ﬁJuden have to go there and there and wait.ﬂ Or some times they say, 
ﬁKomma ndo this number and this number Komma ndo, have to go there.ﬂ Because, like I 
say, there was ma ybe 12 or 13,000 people. So they couldn't give in one day the injection 
for everybody, so they take a certain number of people. Like a block. Like I was in block 

51, it was ma ybe a 100 people, 120 peoples and other block was exactly 220. So they 
take about 200 peoples and, or 150 peoples, and this where you go there, and this was if 
an experiments, it's possible.  
 
04:24:34 
 
Q: Were you aware of any significant attempts in the camp to resist or sabotage the 
Germans?   
 
A: I reme mber once, it was short before the end. They threw out everybody from the 
barracks and it was a block resistor. There was a guy, he was responsible for the block. 
He was a Holland ma n, Bernard I think -- and they took him away. And they look in 
every bed, under the bed, every barrack, supposed to have some  weapon in camp. This I 

know, positive. If they find some thing, ma ybe. I can't  say because we don't see this guy 
anymore. Not just him. Some  people, couple peoples, but he was in Holland. I think he 
was some body. He was from the army and big ma n, but was in concentration camp. But 

why, I don't know. And he was, you know, already in block he was some thing special. 
And they took him away. I'm sure they took him away to Auschwitz and the Gestapo, and 
over there they make some questions and pop -- that's it! Because I know in Auschwitz it 

was in block 14, block 14 was, and in that block everybody would have to Œ be shot. 
They took him to the block 14, and from block 14 was finished. Nobody can go out. 
Because by us in Buna, they doesn™t shot -- they shot, sure -- but no some body wasn't  

tried to the Gestapo. Maybe tried to hang. This was most of time, almost every day -- it 
was not news. So we know when we come  into the camp, we saw in Appellplatz, 
Appellplatz, we saw soldiers come  in, in every corner, soldiers with machine gun and, 

ﬁOh, some body is free today. He going to have his freedom.ﬂ That™s it. 
 
04:27:20 
 
Q: You weren't aware really of a lot of efforts for people to try to sabotage the Germans in 
the factory or --  
 
A: In the factory, special work we didn't have. They don't trust us. We make -- like I say, we 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0017  
56 
 
make all the dirty jobs, the hard jobs, but special jobs they don't trust. They have their 
own peoples. Like they have the Hitlerjugend, they have the old people, the chiefs, the 
engineers, the architects were all the foreign German peoples, even the women --  
 
Q: How do you think you lasted so long?  How did you last so long?   
 
A: I was young. And, you know, this one was ma ybe my luck because we don't see the 
danger and we try to keep -- the first thing what I know, I remember when we arrived to 

camp after the quarantine and we went outside, we were waiting because there was a 
table. There was all the Gestapo and they ma rking down what kind of trade you have. 

What you can do?  
   
04:28:58 
 
So there was a guy -- he's already dead a long time -- he said -- Chaim Komslowski -- 

and he come  to me , he say, ﬁLook, I can't  understand why you are here.ﬂ I say, ﬁWhy I 
here?  The same  thing why you are here -- I'm a Jew.ﬂ But he say, ﬁBut nobody can say 
you are a Jew.ﬂ But the first thing he say, ﬁLook, if you are -- I give you a little advice -- 

if you want to live, try to avoid any beating. Tr y to avoid not to drink water, and if they 
going to ask you what you can do, what kind of trade you have, you say you are a 
carpenter.ﬂ I never was a carpenter in my lif
e. I was 14 years. How could I be carpenter?  
So it comi ng my time, you know, to go before Gestapo, and, ﬁYour number, name ? ﬂ   ﬁNo 
name,ﬂ I say, ﬁ79630.ﬂ ﬁWhat is your trade? ﬂ  So I say, ﬁI'm a carpenterﬂ so the Gestapo, 
the Gestapo say, ﬁWhat?  What?  You are a carpenter?  You so young. You™re a 

carpenter? ﬂ  I say, ﬁI'm sorry. I was learning carpenter.ﬂ So they put me with the 
carpenters. It was good, but I have a couple Polack, the son of a bitch -- I'm sorry -- some 
murderer. So I go to the, you know, to the barrack to work things like a carpenter, and 

they give me  a stick and they say, you ma ke a broom. I don't know how to do that. I 
never saw a carpenter, like, you know, how to ma ke it round. I don't know how. So, 
nobody want to show me  because they were scared and this bitch come  in and he say, 

ﬁYou not a carpenter. Youﬂ -- and they start to hit me, to kick me, to hit me. There was -- 
an SS was sitting there. So he come  in and ask him, ﬁHey, why do you hit him? ﬂ  So he 
say, ﬁBecause he was lying. He is not a carpenter.ﬂ So he tell him, ﬁYou let him go.ﬂ So 

he called me  and he say, ﬁHere, you have the cans, you are going to wash the cans. You 
can clean the toilet.ﬂ And this was my luck. So times like I say you have some Germans 
that was....
