Beginn ing Tape One, Side A 
 
Question: This is the 
United States
 Holocaust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with
 Richard Peterson, 
conducted by
 Gail Schwartz
 on 
April 6
th
, 1999 at the 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum. What is your 
full name? 
Answer: 
Richard William Peterson
. 
Q: And where were you born
 and when  were you born? 

A: In 
[indecipherable] Iowa
 on September 29
th
, 1925. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit about your ch
ildhood and your fam
ily. Who made up the 
memb ers o f  y ou r  fami ly ? 

A: My father, 
Henry K. Peterson
 was a lawyer. Mother, 
Laura May Peterson. 
I 
had two Œ two others, my  older sister 
Josephine,
 who was 11 years older than  I, 
and my  brother 
Robert,
 nine years older than I. 
Q: And you spent your child
hood in this one location? 
A: Exactly, yes. 

Q: What were your in terests as a young ch ild? 

A: I had, oh I think a variety of th
ings. One thing I think Mother and Dad 
encouraged a lot of reading, we did a lo
t of reading at home. The usual childhood 
sports, I think. I think beyond th at also 
Mother and Dad encouraged  collections of

things. Stamp collections, that sort of th
ing basically that was of interest. Music 
was always a part of our home. Mother sa
ng beautifully and sh
e played the piano, 
we had th at sort of thing. Interestingly 
too at home, I think th
ough, we had quite a 
bit Œ because on my father™s side, Danish
 background, as the 
name indicates. On 
my mother™s side the fa
mily went way back from 
New England
 Yankee people. 
So on Dad™s side we would 
have my  grandparents who 
lived just a block away, 
we™d be often times in their home. We 
learned little bit of Danish, used some 
Danish in the home place, and my father had not spoken Englis
h until he was five. 
On Mo th er™s side we had a lot of Ci
vil War background because she had three 
uncles who were in the Civil War. We had 
a lot of Civil War songs and a lot of 
that sort of thing basically. So there was 
a kind of a developing interest of history 
as well too, during that time. 
Q: What kind of physical condition were
 you in? Were you a healthy child? 
A: Yes, yeah. Oh I had the usual, I th
ink, ch ildhood diseases
 basically and th e 
scrapes and bruises, that kind of thing. 
Bu t no, nothing unusual. It was Œ it was a 

good Œ good ch
ildhood, healthy-wise, you bet. 
Q: And were you small for your
 age or tall for your age? 
A: Right about averag e I would 
think, yeah. I think average. 

Q: Uh-huh. And did you have
 any religious training? 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999

A: We were Baptists. The Baptist persua
sion is that there is no baptism until you 
reach what is called the age of believer. 
I was baptized wh en I was nine years old 
after some instruction, basically. And of 
course in the Baptist church that™s by 
imme rsion. Mother Œ D-Dad was very ac
tive. Not only his 
profession but in 
community life and religious life as well too.
 He™d been  the past president of the 
Iowa
 Baptist Association. Mo th er was even
 a stronger Baptist than he was. She 
was what was called a deep water, loud 
shouting Baptist and she en joyed the reli Œ 
so we had Œ we had a Œ a good Œ 
good Œ good religious background. 
Q: Did you have many friends? Were you a so cial child? 
A: Yes, I think so. Neighborhood friends, 
quite a few of those. The neighborhood 
quote gangs, end quote, I s
uppose. Then farther along in school we lived just 
within a Œ oh, a block or so of 
[indecipherable]
 school where I attended, and we 
had a lot of friends at school, I Œ I think so, yes. 

Q: Mm-hm. Was your family a very emo
tional family? Did they encourage you as 
a boy to show your emoti
ons, or to keep them in? 
A: There was never direct lect Œ any Œ 
any limitation of Œ of showing emotion. 
Dad was quite serious just by his demeanor
 basically. Mother Œ Mo ther had mo re 
expression I think basically and she en
joyed things mo re. She was a Œ a Œ a 
delightfu lly humorous person, a lot of fun to
 be around. Dad, as I say, was more 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
6
serious, but he was a very, very, very fi
ne person. And looking back, too, in the 
home, as I said, it was a lot of enc
ourag ement of reading and a lot of 
encouragement of motivati
on to do th ings. Dad was very active community-wise 
and he urged all of us to 
Œ to be involved in high schoo
l activities, o ther activities 
as well. An interesting thing about the fam
ily, though, you see, we™re almost rather 
like two families. My Œ in the sense that 
my sister was 11 years older, my brother 
nine, and I, as Mother said, the side di
sh that came on orders was that much 
younger, you see. So I Œ they were
 up and growing, my  Œ my  sister
 Josephine, 
brother
 Robert, 
they were kind of on a different level by the time I was Œ I came 
along. So  I was home quite a bit my self, in those later years.  
Q: When  did you star
t becoming aware of 
Europe
? 
A: I think because of the interest in read
ing we had, we were really quite young, 
because Mother™s tw
o spinster sisters had both been to 
Europe
. Quite unusual at 
that particular time is th
ese young women, they were 
teachers, basically, they had 
both been  in 
Europe
. My Aunt
 Ag nes
 had Œ had been in 
Germany
 a number of 
times and studied there. Aunt
 Belle
 had been with her al
so. But we would have, 
when  Aunt
 Belle
 and Aunt Œ Aunt Agnes 
were there, talks about 
Europe 
and 
visiting about 
Euro pe
. So really as younger people 
we were aware of at least 
Euro pe.
 Not the rest of the world, but 
Europe
, certainly. And I™m speaking now

of Œ of ages probably  of 10 and 
12, maybe eight, we were aware of 
Europe
. 
News-wise, later though, because it wasn™t
 of course until I was getting in to later 
grade school that the world news became more and more important. 
Q: Did your parents talk that over with
 you? How aware were you of the situation 
getting worse in
 Europe
? 
A: We were aware because first of all we had the ﬁ
Des Moines Register,ﬂ 
the 
state paper that the folks r
ead avid ly, they  would discuss it. We had radio news 
basically as well, too. So I think proba
bly as Œ as thingswere beginning to 
develop, I rememb er discussions of the Sp
anish Civil War, that would be wh at, in 
the late 1930™s. And then of course when 
the war itself b egan in the first or seco nd 
of September 1939, why, we were mu ch, mu ch aware of it.  
Q: What was your personal reaction when  
Œ in  September ™39? Do  you rememb er 
that? 

A: Yes, I remember quite clearly becaus
e that morning, I re
me mb er co min g  in to  
the kitchen, the paper was th
ere and Dad was very disturbe
d, having read the Œ the 
war that Œ the word had come that 
Œ that of course as we reme mb er, 
Germany
 had 
moved in to the Œ in-into Œ into  
Danzig
, and then that the British gave the 
ultimatum and I remember the talk, we all heard 
Neville Chamberlain
 saying that 
they were given ultimatum, we have rece Œ 
[indecipherable]
 undertaking, so

we™re therefore at war. I reme mb er Dad bein g disturbed, Moth er to a degree too, 
but I-I think Œ I think maybe Œ maybe 
Dad was more evident about it.  
Q: And you were in what grade? 
A: Well, I would have been at that time,
 which was 1939, in Œ I™d bega Œ I began 
school as a five year old in 1930, so I 
Œ I would have been 
about the eighth or 
ninth grade at that time, or in that period. 
Q: Did you feel threatened at all by that news? 
A: Not really, not really. That came a bit later. 
Q: Okay , so you continued 
to go to school in 1939. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: And your life did no
t change immediately? 
A: Correct, correct, but the real Œ the real 
change came in Ap ril of 1940, the next 
spring, during th e first 
[indecipherable]
 of course it was the so-called static w ar, 
nothing happening basically. But it was 
in April, the next April, when 
Germ any
 
moved in to first 
Denmark 
and then  the Scan dinavian co untries, and that was very 
Œ very  meaningful because I reme mb er 
so well of going over that mo rning to  
Grandma and Grandpa™s, they™re
 still living. This time they
 were in Œ in the 80™s. 
But I can picture just as we
 talk right now, Grandpa 
Peterson
 sitting there in the 
sun in th e early mo rning as if he were stunned. The war did come. And I said in

Danish,
 Bedstefar [Danish]
. Yeah, da Œ I™ll put it sa Œ put it in Danish again. 
[Speaks Danish here]
 The Germans have 
Denma rk
. And th en in English he says, 
poor little 
Denmark,
 she couldn™t do a thing. She coul
dn™t do a thing. And he just 
Œ he™d been in the German
 army, you se Œ oh, I™m so
rry, the Œ the Danish army. 
And of co urse it was a great history 
in the 1860™s wh en Grandpa was in 
Denmark
 
growing up, of the first Œ you 
know, th-the first war with 
Germany
. And th en of 
course the World War II is Œ World War Œ wa
r was there also, but this was a really 
traumatic thing for them. And we Œ we sensed
 that, we could see that in Œ in Œ in 
their Œ in their make-up, wh at was happening.  
Q: And did you respond in an
y way, did you feel threat
ened then, because of the 
connection to your family? 

A: Oh, I think Œ I think not too much at th
at time. We knew things of course were 
getting much more so because foll
owing that of course we recall 
Norway 
fell, and 
then of course 
Germany
 moved into Œ in to the low 
co untries and on and then  of 
course there was a lot of 
awareness when the German 
[indecipherable]
 went 
through the 
Ardennes
, to the great Œ the great shock an d surprise of the French 
and British. And then of course 
the Œ the escape of the British at
 Dunkirk
 to get 
across, we Œ that was a lot in the news
, we were very, very aware of that. 
Q: So th is is a young Œ as a 
teenager, you fo llowed in the news. 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

A: Quite a bit, because in school we would also Œ not by tha Œ by this time we™re 
getting in to Œ into Œ into  high school. I 
would have begun high
 school Œ I began 
high school, it would have been in Œ it had 
begun in 1939. I begun 
just that fall. In 
high school the current affairs ma gazines,
 the teachers were visiting about it back 
and fo rth, even though 
the war was still in 
Europe
, of course, basically. But we 
were quite aware of it, yeah. 
Q: Up to  that point, did you have any 
Jewish friends, were there any Jewish 
families liv ing in your town? 
A: Yes. Yes. Polish friends as a matter of fact. I was in grade school with 
Ma rvin
 
Richards, 
with
 Stanley
 
Krazney
(ph), both  of Jewish Œ and some Œ and some 
girls, too. So  we Œ we Œ we had good 
friends that were, yes. We were just 
youngsters, of course, but then  on into hi
gh school we Œ we ha
d number of Jewish 
families in 
Council Bluffs
, yes. 
Q: And did you read anything in th e ne
wspaper about what was happening to the 
Jews in 
Germany
 in the 30™s and so forth? 
A: To my recollection, nothing that I 
recall, no.Although I 
do recall Dad brought 
ho Œ brought hom Œ brought home a story 
once from the office, very facetious, a 
fun story. He had some Jewish clients 
and th Œ interesti
ngly enough, h Œ Dad 
represented one side, the other attorney  in
 his o Œ the other pe
ople, and th ey were 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

11
visiting back  and forth, the Jewish gen
tlemen ga Œ came quite involved back and 
forth. And finally as they left, the firs
t group left, Dad™s client remained, leaned 
over and says, can you blame 
Hitler
? Can you blame 
Hitler
? But that Œ that was a 
kind of a Œ of a joke sort 
of thing. But there had been
 word obviously at the time 
that things were happening in 
Germ any
 as far as anti-Semitic
 things basically, but 
no greater awareness at 
the time, I would say. 
Q: And no evidence Œ 
A: As far as I would Œ 
Q: Œ of an ti Œ and no eviden ce 
of anti-Semitism in your town ? 

A: No, I think not. We had at that time a 
synagogue. The buildin
g is still there, the 
congregation no long Œ but the Œ i-it wa
s a fairly active synagogue. And I don™t 
ever, ever recall at home any Œ any su gges
tion of anti-Semitism 
at all. The wa Œ 
ma Œ dad Œ Mother and Dad we
re both very, very liberal 
in attitude, and very, very 
tolerant. Matter of fact we had Jewish ne
ig hbors lived  right next door to  us. And 
there Œ there was never, to my recoll
ection, any reflection about them as 
individuals. 

Q: Okay , so I assume then 
as things go on, you™re a student at school, you™re 
following world affairs and then
 when  Œ what happened wh en
 Pearl Harbor
 
occurred? 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

A: We got the word, of course, that Sund
ay  afternoon at home. They™re saying, we 
interrupt this news 
[indecipherable]
 and so forth. A grea
t Œ a great shocking 
thing. At this time, age 16, realized that not fully as yet, but it was going to affect 
us. The next mo rning in  the 
ﬁDes Moines Registerﬂ
 there appeared a Œ a Œ the 
name was 
Ding Darling
, he was one of the leading ca
rtoonists in the country , and 
here was this Œ this drawing. It was of Uncle
 Sam
 kneeling, holding in his arms  a 
sailor with a knife in his back. And Uncle
 Sam 
was looking up in  fury and anger, 
shaking his fist at the departing Japane
se aircraft. Powerful thing. I remem-mem-
member very well, and that™s one of the 
first times I ever re
member seeing Dad in 
tears, at that. And that was now Mo
nday morning at home. At sch ool, 
Abraha m 
Lincoln 
High School, our principal Mr. 
Kern, Gerald Kern
, a Œ a very fine 
educator and he ran a tight school. He called the entire school body togeth er, we 
were in the Œ the big, large audito rium. 
He perceived in his wisdom how he™ll be 
affecting us, and he had brought Œ he br
ought in a large floor model radio wh ich 
was up on th e stage. And I can see him ye
t. The auditorium, large but couldn™t 
take all of them, so there were other stude
nts in the aisles, the balcony, the whole 

thing. And we sat there in
 dead silence, and Mr. 
Kern 
turned on President 
Roosevelt™s
 war message. And how interesting. 
I thought about it over the years. 
Over Œ over the Œ the Œ the stage, on the 
proscenium of the stage, in large gothic

letters in high school were, ye come to 
learn , go forth to serve. How rather 
prophetic looking back, huh, at those tim
es. That was Monday an
d then of course 
during th e week, difficult. To drop back  a 
bit though, the week befo re had been  a 
tense week because I reme
mber th-the Œ the Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 this country as 
we recall, as the special en Œ envoys, em
issaries and there were big pictures of 
them in the paper, them smiling and very
 Œ you know. And th en came the word 
about it. But I rememb er wh
en, during the end of the we
ek as we™re reaching Œ it 
would have been in probably De
cember fourth or fifth Œ thir
d, fourth or fifth, that 
the word came that the y  were re-reaching so
me kind of an accord
, they thought Œ I 
remember saying to Dad, Da
d, how lucky Œ a war with 
Japan 
would be terrible, 
wouldn™t it? And then of course, came th
e events of Sunday 
and th en Mo nday, of 
course, war was declared. 

Q: And so you went on with life as
 usual at Œ in Œ in  high school? 
A: To a degree, but it was changing, beca
use we realized things were indeed 
happening, and they  already had, to  th
is extent. The National Gu ard had been 
already brought into  federal service by that 
time. I thi Œ I think that our local unit, 
which was the 168
th
 infantry of the na Œ 34
th
 division had been  mu stered in in 
January the year before. And we were aw
are of it because a number of the high 
school student seniors were in the Na
tional Gu ard and they were gone. And I

reme mb er then, it was in the Œ May of that year, which would have been 1941, 
before the war, but here they made arra
ngements and I rememb er being in Œ I was 
in the band and orchestra, and it was al
ways typical that we would play, the 
orchestra, we would play Œ our Œ our school march was 
ﬁThe Pilgrim™s Chorusﬂ 
from 
Ta nnhäuser
. And Œ and Mr. 
Kern
 liked it, it was very
 good. Much better 
than ﬁ
Pomp and Circumstance.ﬂ
 Bu t I rememb er being th Œ we were practicing 
and in came the high school seniors and 
I remember I was so, as a youngster, 
moved, because here were four, five or
 six of the high sc
hool students now on 
active duty, they were there in uniform, th
ey came back to graduate. So that was Œ 
so we were very much aware of it. And 
to drop back to  your other question, how 
did it change? We were mu ch aware, the Œ the high school paper, ﬁ
The Echoesﬂ
 
began having items more and more of clas
smates we had, or students who were 
now in the service, in the 
military, back and forth. As 
well, at our high school we 
had
 ROTC, 
junior
 ROTC
, we were all in it, even
 band Œ band people had a 
military band and the whole thing. So th
ere was more emphasis all the time. I 
mean that things are going 
to happen, young people and 
you™ve got training that™s 
going on here, it™s going to be helpful to 
you. So the Œ the hi
gh school paper as I 
said, was carrying more and more news 
about people who graduated, and wh ere 
they were training and so forth, so we™re 
very mu ch aware of it. And, may I add, 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

15
the school activities b egan to be directed
. Junior Red Cross, for example, was 
having mo re projects. As Œ as youngsters
, I was involved with the Boy Scouts, the 
Boy Scout project even at that time was 
collecting aluminum, s-scrap aluminum to 
get for the war effort. So we Œ we
re doing, things were happening. 
Q: Did you ever picture yourself in
 the army when 
you were young? 
A: Not immediately. You sudde
nly began realizing, as the 
senior class ahead of us 
graduating, they were going in , that this
 was going to  be happening to you. So 
gradually we recog Œ it was a part of it, 
and we were expected to do it and we 
knew it was coming by that time. 

Q: Was it a frightening prospect? 
A: No. I Œ I think at that time there was 
so much Œ so much 
patriotism. You know, 
reme mb er 
Pearl Ha rb or
 and so forth, and of course 
Germany
 declared war right 
away too on this, as you recall Œ as one re
calls. So, I don™t think Œ I don™t think wa 
Œ it was a fearful project. Our feeling was 
everybody™s in it, we will be too, and 
it™s a part o f party responsib ility. It™s a gr Œ 
a gr Œ a great sense of patriotism at that 
time. 

Q: So would you describe yourself in th
e later high school years as a mature 
young person? 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
16
A: I think fairly so. 
[indecipherable]
 to this. I had been  the quote baby unquote at 
home. 
Josephine
 and 
Robert
 were up, they were in co
llege and so  forth. And of 
course, you touch upon them actua l
 Œ the war touching us, brother 
Robert
 was 
finishing University of 
Iowa
 in law. He had finished 
in 1940. He we
nt into the 
FBI
 initially, for a time, and 
then because he had an 
ROTC
 commission from
 
Iowa
, he got a deferment and had 
a special service with the 
FBI
 overseas, but we 
were aware of the war going on, very mu
ch indeed . So  Œ and Œ but I, in my  
situation, Moth er always Œ she was very ca
ndid about it, she said
 that I needed to 
get out more and so forth. And it Œ I-I was, 
I think, a little bit sh
eltered at the time. 
Q: Did you talk about th
e war with your friends? 
A: Yeah. We Œ we did quite a bit. To dr
op back now, we™re talking now ™41, you 
see the first real involvement that we kn
ew ab out, was when  the Marines landed in 
Guadalcana l 
in August of 1942. That was the firs
t real, as I recall, over action by 
the nation as far as being on the attack, th
at I remember offhand.
 So we were much 
aware of that basically. Things were happe
ning then too. And of co urse, as well, 
the National Guard unit that I spoke of, the 168
th
 regiment, 34
th
 division was at 
Camp
 Claiborn e, Louisiana
 and they were one of the 
first to go overseas, which 
was a Œ yeah, they went over, went to north
 Ireland, 
I think it was in January of 
™42. So the result is that all the homet
own people were aw are of their Œ their Œ 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

17
their sons, their husbands, brothers were
 Œ in the National Guard now Œ now were 
overseas now, so you began to feel it mu
ch more locally, that here were local 

hometown boys that ha
d already gone over. 
Q: Had you heard anything in 1
942 about camp s, labor camp s Œ 
A: Not a bit. 

Q: Œ other kind of camp s? 

A: Not a bit. As I recall Œ it™s hard to 
loo Œ think back on th
at, and I don™t think 
no-no-not a word  about labor camps.  

Q: Had you heard about Œ 

A: And even  about co ncentration camp s, 
I don™t Œ I don™t recall any awareness of 
that. 

Q: Had you heard anything about ghettos? 

A: Ghettos, yes, because of our history 
study basically that we knew Œ we knew 
historically, I mean, of the Œ the existen ce of the Œ the older 
Œ the European cities 
of Œ of ghettos, oh, I Œ I 
think particularly in Œ in 
Germany
, the German ghettos. 
The 
Rothschilds,
 it was a wonderful, interesting, th-the
 R o th sch ild
 family. The 
film, 
George Arliss 
was in it. They Œ we™re talking th e mid 30™s now. And that 
began in the story of a Œ in Œ in , I think a ghetto in

was new then, but we began reading ab out 
it, so we were aware of it on the matter 
of Œ matter of wh at it 
was, what they were. 
Q: Okay , now you™re what, a senior in
 high school? And an
ything special about 
that year? 
A: Junior, I mean basically then, I would 
have been, you see, a junior Œ yeah, I 
would have been a senior, y
ou™re right in 1942, because 
then, all into the rest of 
the year and then graduated 1943. I became 
Œ yeah, 17 in September of ™42, th at™s 
right. 

Q: And what was your senior year like? 

A: We were getting closer to graduati
on obviously . I think, looking back, the 
courses that we had, there was a real 
awareness of may b e boning up on your 
mathematics and so forth, that kind of
 thing basically because you might have 
military. In the 
ROTC 
units, as I recall having a lot Œ a lot of training. If nothing 
else, we learned at least close order drill 
and the manual of arms, if nothing else. 
So that was it. And also, in school we
 were getting recruiting requests from the 
navy, the army  and so fo rth to get signed up
 to take tests basically, see if you Œ if 
you could qualify maybe for some kind 
of a Œ of a Œ of a military education 

program, which there was a number of th
em. The navy had them, the army  had

19
them and so forth. So we
 took tests now during th at year to see if you could 
qualify for that. So we were 
heading in  that direction. 
Q: And did you qualify for any of that? 
A: Yes, the way it worked, graduated in 
June of 1943. We™d heard nothing back 
from the tests at that partic
ular time. Some of our clas
s, for example had already 
done Œ signed up for submarine officer tr
aining and so  forth, some for the air 
force. I did not. I went to 
Drake
 University in June, just
 after graduation fo r about 
Œ it was about a month, six weeks. 
Drake,
 because it had been  Dad™s school, it 
was a good school in 
Des Moines
, and Dad™s thought was, get as much education 

as you can before the military, which was 
exactly right. And then , after about six 
weeks there, I got word that I would be e
ligible for the Army 
Specialized Training 
Reserve Program, 
ASTRP
. Reserve being for those who had not yet attained age 
18 and you coul
d go into the enlisted reserve, start off. A nd then, after finishing 
one™s first term, and wh
en you reached your 18
th
 birthday or past it, then that term 
would stop in school, you wo
uld be s Œ be Œ you would be
come a part of the army 
itself, be sworn in, have y
our basic training, then the 
program wo uld come back to 
school afterwards. All right, to drop back 
now, my  particular group that I qualified 
for, we were Œ I was still in
 Des Moines, Drake
 University. Down, I remember 
going down town at the directi
on, and I had all the papers and so forth, I Œ in Œ 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999

went into  the enlisted reserve, took the 
oath  basically and so forth. And then  
terminated my work at
 Drake, 
went home and oh then  two or three weeks 
afterwards reported to  then 
Fort Crook
 for induction into the actual Œ the actual 
service itself. Our group went to 
Kansas
 University at 
Lawrence, Kansas. 
And 
we began our first tour of 
ASTRP
, all reservists, we had Œ we had uniforms,
 
ROTC 
uniforms basically, the first part of Augu
st and we were there then with the 
first term o f just basic engineering be
ginning supposedly, 
until we™d accomplished 
our 18
th
 birthday. Mine was September 29
th
, you see. So I finished the first term, 
and then  those of us that had reached ag e 
18 then went home for a brief furlough, 
we reported to Camp  
Dodge
 in  
Iowa
, then  sworn into  the army  itself, huh, and 
then began our real army experience, be
cause after the initia
l beginning in the 
army  you have just your uniform, your 
shots, your medical, the whole thing, 
[indecipherable]
 orientation, then  you are sent to a basic training camp. And that 
would have been then  Œ that was just 
about the middle of Novemb er of 1943. 
Q: And wh-where were you sent for basic training? 

A: 
Fort Benning , Georgia.
 That was the training Œ th -the training camp . First of 
all, that was the so calle
d infantry  school for the 
United States
, th-th-the Œ for 
historically that had been the Œ the headqua
rters of infantry training basically and 
General
 Patton
 had been there basically, earlier years, quite well known. We went 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
21
there and began our basic tr
aining then, that would have
 been the first part of 
December of 1943. 
Q: And still, had you been awar
e in the previous spring, the 
Warsaw
 ghetto 
uprising in April ™43? 

A: I don™t recall it at all, no. That was 
in the spring of ™43? No, I don™t recall. 
Q: Okay, now you™re in 
Georgia
. 
A: Yes, ma™am. Yes. 
Q: And can you just tell us a little bit about that. 
A: It was cold and damp, I recall that 
quite a bit. But it was something else 
because now we were in uniform full tim
e. We began our act
ual basic training 
which at that time was a 17 year Œ a 17 
week  course. You be
gin the whole thing 
again. Now, we™d already had, to a degree 
we™d had some military training at Œ in 
high school we had some, w-we had Œ we™d  had some at 
Kansas
, 
KU
, at 
Lawrence.
 So we had the basic, we had alr 
Œ been through clos
e order drill, we 
had the manual of arms degree, but then
 you go through the whole thing and now 
for the thirst Œ the first tim
e you™re in the barracks and 
so forth. Non-coms were 
okay, we were learn Œ our training co
mpany was in the area called the 
Harmony
 
Church area, which was the training area that we had for the 
AST 
people. We 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

22
were there and week by week the traini
ng went on basically, and we got underway 
in pretty good sh ape. 
Q: And then  wh en you comp leted basic training?  
A: I had a mishap. I™ll tell you. Measles wa
s quite viru lent. I never had measles. 
And I reme mb er I got we Œ I Œ and this Œ 
we were pretty well down the line, we 
had Œ we had Œ we had 
got rid of our training rifles, we had our new 
M1s
, training 
further with them. And then the next Œ th
e next program was that we would hike 
out to, call it 
Caramouche, c-a-r-a-m-o-u-c-h-e 
range. It was a Œ oh, about a 10 
mile hike. We hiked out and we had a week
 tha Œ actually I think a week on the 
range itself. And we had just finished Œ a 
week  or 10 days Œ we
 had just finished 
the last exercise, which was the infiltra
tion course, where you crawl, you know, 
under the Œ the firing machine gun bullets a
nd so forth. A lot of very vigorous, you 
know. That next mo rning I woke up and I was just speckled with 
[indecipherable]
. And I rememb er th-that my non-com was there, I se Œ I s Œ I 
said, corporal, what Œ he says, 
Pete
, you got measles. In to the hospital. Now the 
rule was that if a perso n , a trainee lost fi
ve days or mo re of basic training, he had 
to go back  into an earlier training cycle,
 of people who had begun later, you see, to 
pick up the time.

Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Richard Peterson.
 This is tape number one, 
side
 B. 
And you were talking about the 
measles during basic training. 
A: Into the hospital, a fairly high feve
r, but I made it by about four days okay , 
back in, but because of tec
hnicality I had Œ I was told I 
would have to go back into 
an earlier cycle. I was devastated. Here I wa
s, I™d been with th
ese Œ most of them 
my friends from 
Kansas
 and all fellows I™d known basically now Œ in basic, 
literally, fo r over the last 10 weeks or so. 
And it was very Œ a re
ally tough growing 
up process because these are 
the folks I™d come to know 
and so forth, that I was 
taken aback. But anyway, transferred back
 in to another Œ another group basically, 
and we completed it. But then, the next thi
ng that happened was 
this, we were just 
barely finishing it up, word  came from
 Washington
 that the 
AST
 prog Œ 
P
 
program was being eliminated
. They needed people ca
rrying guns, not books and 
the result was that not only the 
ASP  Œ  TP  
was being washed out, but also a 
number of Air Force cadets that had only got
ten to a certain level, were also into 
the infantry. Result was then that we were 
much Œ a lot of turm
oil what™s going to 
happen. Mother learned about it, shewas terribly upset, she wrote the 

congressman and so forth, as if an ything 
could be done. But that™s the way it was 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
24
and so we got packed  up, we
 had finished pretty mu ch 
of our training and we were 
then shipped to the 86
th
 
Blackhawk
 division, then training at Camp
 Living ston, 
Louisiana.
 So the trip 
then was from
 
Fort
 Benning
 to Camp
 Living ston.
 There 
we were met and greeted basically and then
 Œ and then  began our training with the 
86
th
 division. 
Q: At that time you s Œ obviously spoke Da
nish, did you speak an
y German at that 
time? 
A: A little, not Œ not much. 
My Œ my Œ actually, the few words I had I learned 
from Aunt
 Agnes
 who had been a German teache
r, as I mentioned. My really 
second language if I have it was Span ish. B
ecause I™d had Œ well, 
first of all, I had 

two years of Latin, wonderful background 
and then tw o mo re years of Sp anish in 
high school. So I could get along to a 
degree. My Œ and my  Danish, I Œ I was 
rapidly fo rg etting, because that drifts away. 
Q: Okay , now you
™re with the 86
th
 in wa Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: And you were trained to do what? 

A: Infantry. We were assigned to 
A 
company 342
nd
 infantry. We were a Œ wh-
which is Œ which, as I shou
ld add, a rifle company. To
 explain a bit further, in a 
division, infantry, about 15,000 men, one-h
alf of those are infantry themselves, in 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

the form of three regiments. We were in 342
nd
. The 
Blackhawk
 had regiments 
341
st
, second and third. And every regiment
 then would have three battalions. A 
battalion would be composed of a headquar
ters comp any of the co lonel, lieutenant 
colonel ba Œ of the lieutenant co lonel ba
sically, of the Œ of the battalion. The 
headquarters comp any had staff and there 
was a reconnaissance patrol and so me 
other service. Then, in each 
Œ in each battalion beyond th
at, there were three rifle 
comp anies and a weapons comp any. And I 
Œ and I give this because it gives a 
better background for the future I think, 
too. A rifle company had approximately, 
in wh at was called the table of organization, 
TO, 
about 180 men commanded by, 
normally, a captain. And then there woul
d be a lieutenant, who is called the 
platoon leader, for each of the four platoo
ns. The Œ the three rifle platoons and the 
weapons platoon. And sometim
es there would be another 
Œ another officer who is 
Œ be assista n t Œ the assistant company 
co mma nder. In our comp any it was Captain
 
Mitchell
, and th en we had the Œ th-the Œ the f
our lieutenants. Basically Œ trying to 
recall base Œ the names we ha
d ba Œ there was Lieutenant 
Hess, 
Lieutenant 
Budman
(ph), Lieutenant
 Greenburg
(ph). And those were basically the officers 
that we had. Each platoon, rifle platoon 
was composed  of three squads of 12 men 
each. Was the platoon sergeant, a platoon 
guy, like an assistant, the assistant 
person. And then, for each s
quad, the squad leader was 
a staff sergeant, which is 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

26
the three chevrons and then
 the rock er underneath, an assistant squad Œ squad 
leader, who™d be regular 
[indecipherable]
 and then the balance of the men will be 
12 
[indecipherable]
. Be two scouts, two patro Œ two 
[indecipherable]
 of two 
squad scouts, a 
Browning
 automatic rifleman  basica
lly and other riflemen down 
the line, too. So therefore each Œ each
 rifle platoon had those people. In the 
weapons platoon. separate, those Œ thosewere the light machine guns, and th ere 
were two sections of those basically, w
ith machine guns each 
and also mortar s, 
which is 60 millimete
r weapon, the tubes that fire 
the rockets, those thi Œ that 
would be a rifle company. There was also
 each ra Œ in each battalion, a heavy 
weapons comp any, which would be the Œ 
wo uld be the Œ th e Œ the water cooled 
heavy machine guns, and the 
81 millimeter mortars. A nd 
so  that was basically the 
structure of Œ of a regi
ment. And then we were 
A
 comp any of that, and I was in 
the first squad, third platoon. I was a scout, okay. 

Q: And so th en you were trained to be
 a scout and then  you continued on to 
where? 

A: Exactly, we finished training, provisio
nal training in Februa
ry, March. Picture 
changed because all of us recognized th
ere were more people. Air Force people 
coming in th at had been  washed  out of Œ 
ne Œ not wa Œ that™s the wrong te Œ but 
they Œ they™ve been transferred out of th
e infantry. So  we began getting a lot more

27
people in and really the company was pr
etty much complete
, the way it stayed 
pretty mu ch thro ugh, by probab ly
 May, June. We were then 
Lo uisiana, 
Camp 
[indecipherable] 
until Œ through July, went on 
maneuvers for the month of 
August and then the 
word came down that we we
re going to be transferred 
probably out to 
California
, the whole division for amphibious training, and th at™s 
what happened. 
Q: And? 
A: To 
California
 in  September, we had about Œ been probably  a span of two 
months of amphibious trai
ning, wh ich was getting us ready fo r the south Œ th e 
Pacific
. There™s the small landing craft you see in the pictures of basically, you 
know, like fre Œ quite a bit 
mo re. So we had a training 
camp , comp lete amphibious 
training. We finished that training at 
San Luis Obispo
 by mid-November. 
Q: 1944. 

A: 1944, exactly. Waited and then back after
 San Luis Obispo
, we™ve been in 
southern 
California
, basically in 
San Diego
, December 17
th
 began the Battle of 
the Bulge, which changed the picture tr
emendously. Word came down we were 
going to  probably be going to
 the east coast, going to 
Europe
. The requirement 
was they needed more troops in
 Euro pe 
because of the impact of the bulge. 
Q: You are now 19 years old. 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
28
A: Yes. Important because at that tim
e you had to be 19 to be qualified for 
overseas training. And interestingly enough
, back in June, those who™d already 
attained age 19 of our group, privates, 
wer-w ere transferred out, more people 
brought in. But that was the 
rule at the time. S o  we we
re 19 at the time, exactly . 
The division got the information, we we
re put on a Œ on an emergency basis of 
packing. We were put on sp ecial details, cu
tting wood and so  forth to get all the 
crates together, to get all the material
 crap together, put together. That was 
finished up by probab ly about mid-January  
and we were on the troop trains headed 
east to our division the 
end of January of 1945. 
Q: And then ? 
A: And then  we went east, and we Œ ou
r particu Œ all Œ all of our regiment, 
basically, went to Camp
 Miles Standish, 
which is about 30 miles Œ was about 30 
miles south of 
Boston
. Coming from 
California, 
bright, pleasant, into the snow of 
Massachusetts,
 quite a change. New equipment, 
we got some new uniforms, more 
additional equipment than we had basica
lly. We were there 
probably staging for 
about a week, 10 days, and then  early in 
February, onto  the trains, down to th e port 
of 
Bo sto n
 and we sailed from
 Boston 
in ab out Œ oh, th  Œ maybe the second week 
of February.

Q: By th at time had you he
ard of anything Œ any news
 about labor camps, work 
camps? 
A: Not a bit. 
Q: Death camps? 
A: Not a bit. On the matter of orientation,
 we all received from 
time to time, all of 
us have, the so-called why we fight series. T h at was a 
Walter Huston
, as I recall, 
was involved very much in that. And they were Œ they 
were Œ the first was w hy we 
fight generally and the whole hist
ory basically of the rise of 
Germany 
and Nazism 
and so fo rth. And th en they would take 
it country by co untry, go into  it. These 
would be a series of documentary films we
™d have, as well as other films we were 
having on training, gas traini
ng and so forth, and f Œ and firing. But th is was an 
orientation series as I read it no
w, that really had been acted by 
Walter Huston
, 
directed by 
Capra, Frank Ca pra,
 he developed the whole series for the army , as I 
remember. So we learned why we were with
 England
 fighting, why we were 
basically the free Fr
ench, the Chinese 
[indecipherable]
 and the Russian. And 
these were all good guys. And then the ba
d guys, of course, were th e Japs. The 
militarism of th
e Japanese, and 
Pearl Harbor
 all over again and then of course in 
Germany
 the rise of 
Hitler
 and all the Œ the nasty Nazis and so forth. 
Q: Were you eager to go abroad? 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
30
A: I don™t know about eager. We were r
eady. We had trained comp letely and the 
time had come. And I don™t think that ther
e was any question of eagerness. It was 
a part of it. Maybe in the sense that we
 had friends and relatives and my  Œ my  
situation. My brother was by that
 time in military intelligence in 
South America
. 
He had acquired marvelous Spanish a
nd so  he became m
ilitary intelligence, 
however Œ in the Œ in  the Œ in th e army . So
 we were ready, let me Œ let me put it 
that way. And maybe the time had come, I Œ I™m not sure. There was a lot of Œ get 
a lot of Œ of patriotism about 
Œ to Œ to a modified degree
. We Œ we were still in the 
army, we complained a
nd bitched, pardon the expression,
 but that was a part of it. 
But our friends were over there, brothers, 
relatives overseas, so it was a part of it, 
it was expected. 
Q: Did you feel very old th
en? Older than your years? 
A: I felt Œ I felt more mature. I w as no longe
r the baby of the family. I was one of 
many, many people by that time, others of 
my  Œ my  Œ my  peers, huh, and I was ar 
Œ I think probably mo re self c Œ more se
lf confidence in my self and I know 
looking back that the army 
made all the difference in the world to my  growing up. 

By that time, we™re talking now, as I said
, February  of Œ of 1945, I Œ we had our 
friends in our unit, good buddies and so
 forth. There was a lot of togetherness 
about the whole thing.

Q: And where did you dock? 
A: Our trip over was ab out 10 da
y Œ about 10 days, 
we Œ right at 
LaHavre. 
By 
that time it had been secured, you se
e. Earlier it had to be brought in by 
[indecipherable]
 but this was right Œ right in 
LaHavre
 itself. 
Q: And then  wh ere did you go? 

A: We arrived Œ we debarked late at ni
ght, I recall, down onto th e dock into  great 
big Œ big, huge trucks, la
rge trucks. And I recall very well as we came down, 
we™re getting in . I went past the truck we 
were getting into. It happened to be the 
one where our co mp any co mmander, then Captain
 Mitchell
 was seated. And I 
recall seeing Captain
 Mitchell
 looking up at the windshield, there was a bullet 
hole right through th e windsh
ield of the truck. Intr
oduction. Before we had 
debark ed also, the guys, very juv Œ some
 are throwing candy bars over, and the 

soldiers on 
[indecipherable]
 said, keep your candy, you™re going to be dead in  
three days. Well, ah Œ okay. All the truc
ks black at night, we drove over some Œ 
this is now 
LaHavre.
 We went, as I recall 
[indeciphera ble]
 and then on north to 
the area called 
Old Gold.
 Now there were staging areas in 
France
 named for Œ for 
Œ for cigarettes. 
Old Gold, Lucky Strike
, not as Œ but a large area. We were in the 
Old Gold
 area, which was right up Œ 
it was north of the town of 
Yvetot, y-v-e-t-o-
t.
 The home of Madame 
Bovary
 in the novel, hm. Not Œ not 
Proust
, but anyway Œ 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

32
Madame bo Œ however, we were abou
t oh, eight or 10 miles north of 
Œ
 of 
Yv eto t
 
and as Œ right near a small French village called 
Normanville, n-o-r-m-a-n-v-i-l-
l-e
 in large tents, large, large squad tent
s, cold and chilling. 
And we were located 
there, staging fo r probably 10 days, two 
weeks, getting ready to
 go up to th e front. 
Some mo re equipment, some mo re training.
 As is Œ as a Œ as a squad scout I was 
sent with my fellow scouts up to so  called mi ne, m-i-n-e school, up at 
Sassentot, 
s-a-s-s-e-n- t-o-t
 to learn about German mines. Th
e teller, t-l-e Œ t-e-l-l-e-r mine, 
that was like a plate 
[indeciphera ble]
 plate. The shoe mine, that™s what you have 
a Œ a variety of them. German explosives, 
Primacord
, tetracord. Not th Œ we 
would have mu ch, but at Œ we theo retically, 
the scouts, you see, go out in front of 
the squad to study the terrain and so fort
h and then th e squad leader in charge 
behind you contro ls your ac
tions. So we had th at, we 
were finishing that up and 
we got the word, okay men,
 fold up your tents, we™re
 going back, we™re going to 
be moving out, you™re up to mo rrow to 
the front. Back we went, down to 
Normanville
 and got ready to leav e. 
Q: And you then went? 

A: Beg your pardon? 
Q: And then  you went? 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

33
A: We left, of all things, down to 
Yvetot, 
loaded onto 40 and eights, the old World 
War I style 40 and eights, 40 
men or eight horses, yeah. 
Quarante hommes ou 
huit chevaux.
 In the boxcars, they were 
[indecipherable]
 sma ll, str ewn with 
straw, wonderful, because you could sleep 
on the straw, but there we were. So we 
left by this Œ by the train. Some units I gue
ss went by truck, but we went by train, 
up th rough 
Amien
, on up to  
Na mur
. Now by this time we™re up in Œ getting up 
toward 
Belgium.
 This Œ this took two or
 three days, long time. 
Namur
, 
Liège.
 We 
went thro ugh ju st a very small part of Œ of the 
Netherlands
 at 
Maastricht, m-
double
 a-s-t-r-i-c-h-t
. And then I remember we got 
really, really something to 
think about because boy I 
rememb er going through 
Liège, l-i Œ l-e-i-g
, I think, 
l 
or 
l-i,
 whichever. There on a Œ on a fencepos
t was a German helmet, just stuck on 
top. Hm, first evidence. Then we began seei
ng signs of Œ of a lot of damage, either 
artillery or Œ or bombing 
damage of the city. There was Œ of course, 
Liège
 was one 
of the early areas where f Œ where fightin
g took place. And then really, because 
that particular day twilight was fa
lling, we had alre
ady gone through 
Maastricht, 
and were there stopped when  there was a Œ a 
Œ at least a false alarm,  they thought 
of a German, an air attack, because our an
ti-aircraft guns, which were out near the 
Œ near the Œ near the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ th
e train yard Œ railroa
d yards, began go Œ 
in an action getting Œ nothing 
happened , but they Œ we Œ 
we saw they were there.

But then at Œ twilight came and then 
it became dark and we went through 
Aa chen
, 
which had been terribly destroyed. The mo
onlight, I rememb er driving on Œ riding 
on th e train basically, lookin
g out and seeing all of th
ese ghostly wh ite buildings 
out there, just Œ just the ruins, 
huh, of th-the Œ the destruction of
 Aachen.
 We Œ 
Q: What does that do to a 19 year old from 
Iowa
, to see that kind of destruction? 
A: You Œ it™s pretty spooky. That was our 
first major di Œ war damage we™d seen. 
It was pretty spooky. I think we were ge
tting pretty silent by that time, watching 
what was going past. I was on guard that 
night, which meant that you Œ the sentry 
seated there on the Œ tha-that
 open doorway, basi
cally. And I saw a lot of it as we 
went thro ugh and I think we had two ho
urs basically and Œ but you watched and 
went through. Still awake and I think it 
was probably mid-morn
ing, black of the 
mo rn Œ I mean, by Œ by two or three in th
e morning. We arrived at the city of 
Duren, d-u-r-e-n
 in 
Germany, 
we were in 
Germany
 now. Off the trains and on 
the big trucks, which we call six 
by sixes. Six wh eels and all six 
[indecipherable]
, 
th Œ we call them six by sixes. Out of 
the trucks and head
ing then  Œ we left
 Duren.
 
And they pointed out to us as we went th
ro ugh Œ went through 
a Œ a city square, I 
don™t know who pointed out to us, a statue
 there of a Œ of Œ I don™t know what it 
was. But earlier bombardment had been so
 intense that the statue, th e bronze 
statue had comp letely turned  around. It
 had been facing one 
direction and now it 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

was facing the other direction. 
[phone ringing, tape break]
 On the statue, which 
was of a bro-bronze, as near as we could 
tell, it™s s-still dark 
in the morning, but 
there Œ there were Œ there Œ there were truc
k lights. They pointe
d out the fact that 
it had apparently orig inally been facing 
on Œ to Œ t-to the west, but the Œ the 
arterial bombardment they had had in 
Duren
 was so intense that it had just shifted, 
the statue was facing east. Weird, weird. 
So here was dark, middle of the mo rning, 
cold, chilly. We Œ we were Œ we were cour
se in Œ in-in-in March now. And out of 
Duren 
we drove, heading east toward 
Co log n e. 
Q: What was it like to be in 
Germany
 wh en you put your foot down on German 
soil? Did that have any kind of feeling for you? 
A: One had a Œ one had a diffe
rent feeling. We were there first time again on re Œ 
you know, on Œ on Œ on Œ on en emy soil.
 Lot of curiosity wh at it looked like 
Strangely , in my  situation I kind of Œ coul
d kind of relate back because of the tales 
of my  Aunt 
Agnes
 and being in  
Germa ny
 and so forth and Œ 
and Œ and Œ and what 
little German she had, there were the signs
 and so forth we would see, you know, 
the directional signs. I didn™t know mu ch German at all. I have a little more now, 
but not that much. Then, of course, in
 the morning it began getting lighter, you 
know, eerily mo rning. And began reli Œ we
 were driving through an area now 
heading east on the Œ a main, a 
fairly main roadway toward 
Co log n e
, w h ich  I

think probably was about, I™m gu
essing 30 - 40 miles east of
 Duren
. But here we 
were, of course, basically in a truck goin
g on east. We had seen, oh, forests to one 
side and then buildings. Then began to se
e a lot of bomb  damage or some kind of 
damage to build ings, basically. A
nd th en we prob
ably got into 
Colo gne
, I™m 
guessing, in the con Œ with the truck con
voy by Œ by seven, eight o™clock in the 
mo rning, I™m guessing. And that was something else. The Œ 
Cologne
 had been  
badly damaged, and yet, way up ahea
d were th e two huge spires of the 
Co log n e 
cathedral. Some damage, but they were sta
nding, they were still there. And then 
off Œ truck stopped off into the house, and 
then in Œ into houses, apartments w h ere 
we were being billeted. So
 then we were there in 
Colo gne. 
Now, at that point 
something different happene
d. These were apartment 
houses, people™s belongings, 
I mean their furnitu
re and so fo rth. And someb
ody, strangely  enough, began 
tossing the contents out of the window
s into the central courtyard, just 
indiscriminately. And, was it the result of
 being in  a foreign country, the enemy 
country? A strange thing but it just seemed
 to catch on and Œ a
nd on just a Œ still I 
look back  and why in th e wo rld that was done
, but a Œ just tossed to get rid of it, I 
guess, stuff out of th e Œ out of the rooms, 
into the courtyard th
a Œ then emptied the 
rooms out and we cou Œ we slept in them. 
A strange thing. I Œ I still wonder why it 
was done.

Q: Did you see any civilians, any townsp
eople? Were they affected by the war? 
A: In 
Co log n e
, people were all, I presume had 
been  evicted or gotten out of Œ 
before we came in. I d on™t remember seei
ng a lot of civilians in ca Œ where we 
were in 
Colo gne 
itself. Later, yes, bu-but not in
 Co log n e
 itself. 
Q: Okay , and th en ho
w long did you stay? 
A: We were there, I™d say oh, maybe oh, a 
couple days. I remember of that that we 
were begin getting Œ we ge
tting broadcasts from the 
BBC
 because their signal Œ 
well, we had Œ some guys had radios, I 
vi Œ it was that the Œ that tune about 
Bow 
Bells
, 
bum bum bum bum bu
m, buddle um bu
m, bum bum bum. 
That was the 
signal of the 
BBC
. 
[indecipherable]
 the 
Bow Bell, 
whatever, yeah. And we Œ then 
we got the news from 
England
, British accents and everything, oh yeah. Getting 
things ready, I remember basically we 
were told we™d be there a few days. I 
remember the day before we left, they took 
us all up, we went up to the Œ the attic 
area, huh. It was a la Œ fairly large area
. And there we were briefed in. We had 
been designated as taper 
red able. Taper red able,
 
code word. Taper was the 86
th
 
division. Red, the 342
nd
, able, 
A 
comp any, hm. So that was the designation and 
they told us what to expect. Th
ey meaning, I think it was Captain
 Mitchell
 and na 
Œ cap-captain Œ then Lieutenant 
Greenburg
(ph), who we met. We were going to 
be assigned, said they, up on the 
Rhine
 river, in of all things, the 
Ford
 factory. 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

Was a majo r factory before the war that 
Ford
 had built and we were gonna be sent 
there as our Œ as our location up on the 
Rhine
, okay. Left fairly Œ as I rememb er 
we Œ we left fairly early because we went
 in at nighttime and 
we relieved the eight 
infantry division, wh ich was already th er
e, the men were there. And I remember 
going in to th e bunkers and we Œ and Œ an
d with Œ was Œ was rather wide-eyed 
because here were their old veterans, I me
an you Œ they ™d been Œ th -the eighth had 
been in combat quite awhile. And differe
nt. They were a pretty rough, tough 
outfit. And amazingly, the first real eye 
opener when we got there, one of the 
medics was there. Now, the medics, ever
y platoon had a Œ had a Œ had a medic, 
hm, and they  were not armed, their helmets had great big red Œ wh ite circles with 
red cross. The medic that was with that 
particular group, in the Œ in the bunker 
[indecipherable] 
with eight Œ eighth Œ with the 
eighth Œ of the eighth division, 
strange guys. Projecting out of his aid 
kit was Œ was a bone. Whether it was an 
animal bone, but you know, that Œ that Œ 
well, really, where are we, what are we 
doing here? Any even t, the eighth then 
Œ th e eighth Œ the men of the eighth 
division pulled out and we were then in place in the 
Ford
 factory. And th at™s 
where we saw our first Œ th
e first beginning ev iden ce th
at we™re having and that 
we™re in combat.  
Q: And again, up to that point yo
u hadn™t seen too many civilians. 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

39
A: A Œ hadn™t seen what, I™m sorry? 
Q: Civilians. 

A: No. Some, but not Œ not Œ not Œ oh, 
maybe some people walking on the street, 
that kind of a thing, but no-nothing 
Œ nothing to get tha Œ no, that™s right. 

Q: And then you stayed there? 

A: We were in the 
Ford 
factory, I™m guessing probably about a week. That™s 
when we first began to realize we were
 there because the Germans were our Œ on 
the opposite side of the 
Rhine.
 Now we Œ we™re now on the left or th-the Œ the Œ 
the west bank, all right. Germ
ans on the east side. And the 
Rhine
 at that point, 
very sizeable. I™d say the 
Rhine
 was probably maybe a half a mile wide. It was 
wide. And we could 
look over and see there was a 
village over there. And we 
would go up in the Œ 
in the Œ in the Œ in 
the structure of the 
Ford
 factory. It was 
just as if the workers had 
walked away, there were bi
g Œ there were rather big 
assemb ly lines, there were engines on th
e assemb ly lines being put together, but 
they were all gone, but Œ and walked in, there was a great big 
[indecipherable]
 
inside. 
Colo gne
, thanks to the second armored 
division, they™d  already bi Œ 
somebody painted it up there 
[indecipherable]
. We were there, I™d say, about that 
length of time, but from time to time 
we were getting artillery coming in, just 
nuisance that the Germans had put across.
 Our fir Œ introduction to th e 88, wh ich 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

was the 88 millimeter ca Œ a re
markable weapon 
the Germans had. First of all, it 
was Œ it was began, it was ta Œ it was te
sted in the Spanish Civil War by the 
Germans. It was anti-aircraft, could reach way up 
[indecipherable]
. It could also 
be a 
Howitzer
, which is a Œ and a flat trajectory.
 And I remember that™s the first 
experience, I remember we would Œ the flat
 traje Œ that was re
ally spooky because 
the Germans would fire in and this sharp 
crack and that™s the first you knew it™s Œ 
it was there. And it was Œ it was Œ it was frig h tening. That was our first 
[indecipherable]
 mm-hm. Okay. 
Q: And then, to continue.  
A: Yeah. We were there for about a week . Then we were told we™re gonna be 
pulled out and indeed  we were. 
We were replaced by the 82
nd
 airborne division, 
now that had had experience already during
 the war. And as we Œ I remember as 
we were walking out, marching out past th
e Œ past the cut Œ en-entry kiosk they  
have there, in were coming men of the 82
nd
, we were on the outside, yes. And I 
reme mb er walking past, looking up and th er
e was this great big, tall, tall soldier, 
two big stars. It was General 
Gavin Œ Gavin.
 We saw him. Then we were pulled 
out into  trucks and dropped, taken back 
into a German town 
some distance back. 
Now there we did see civilians for the first time. We were moved into the house, 
we were supposed to be there for a da
y or so, something,
 til we™re moved on

farther. But there was the conversation, wh
at little German I had with Œ with one 
of the ladies there, because she Œ she 
was very upset, very unhappy. This is 
[indecipherable]
 this is your war, this is 
nicht unsere. 
This is not our war, this is 
zin e
(ph) war, this is your war, she was sayi
ng. Bu t she wa Œ she was very, very 
upset about things. We didn™t accept it of
 course, but that™s the way it was. We 
were there a limited time only and then we
 were take Œ put Œ back on th e buses Œ 
on th e bus Œ on the trucks again, six by si
xes, and this was the long trip we had. 
This was really, now will take us into 
Germ any
 itself, okay. We left that suburb 
o-of 
Co lo gne
, but not until after we became aware 
of the first fatality we™d had in 
our co mp any. We had some injuries beca
use as the Germans were dropping these 
shells across, one shell I recall, an 88 fell 
right into th Œ into
 the kitchen area and 
injured, didn™t Œ not badly, some of th
e cooks, shrapnel. An
d Œ an -and you had to 
watch it because you could sometimes hear
 th e shells coming 
in and you™d duck. 
And that was pretty unnerving fo r Œ this was our first 
[indecipherable]
. But then 
we had learned and got the whole story, 
it was a Œ it was a bad situation, unhappy. 
Somebody, an officer had determined it wa
s necessary to have an reconnaissance 
patrol across the 
Rhine
. Why, I™m not sure, but there Œ maybe to make a record or 
something, but they  saw a set up and 
A 
company supplied Œ I was not in Œ 
A 
company supplied a number of the men, a
nd went off at nigh
ttime, boats, rubber

boats across the 
Rhine
. Lieutenant
 Henry, 
who Œ fine, he was a good man, of the 
first platoon, was in charge. The patr
ol was probably  ab out Œ I™m guessing 
probably , I understand about 15 or 20,
 two boats. They got across and as 
reconstructed later they came back. Tell Œ 
the story came back and we were told 
that they got over to the other shore, dark
. Apparently there was Œ there had been a 
lot of firing and there was smoke drif
ting back and forth.
 And Œ and what 
happened  was Œ was one of those drastic, 
terrible things that 
happens in comb at. 
The two scouts moved out ahead. They  were
 probably, as we 
get, maybe 10 or 15 
yards ahead of the patrol itself. 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Richard Peterson
. This is tape number two, 
side
 A. 
A: The scouts had gotten out ahead, maybe 10
 or 15 yards or so, and as we get the 
story, the main patrol was behind them
. The main patrol saw then, two figures 
coming at them in the dark. They  gave
 the password. The challenged party is 
supposed  to answer. The parties did no
t answer. Somebody in  the patrol opened 
fire, only to discover afterwards it was 
the scouts coming back, our own people. 
And 
Co rny Rippo n s
 was killed, he was one of them
, the other I™m not sure. They 
tried, apparently then, to carry
 Corny™s
 body back. They  couldn't get it all the way 
back and they had to leave him over there, basically, back they came. But that was 
our first Œ one of Œ one of those terrible
 thi Œ I mean, you know, the matter of the 
so-called friendly fire
. As I think General 
Schwarzkopf
 said once, once the 
missile leaves the barrel, it™s no longer frien
dly. Bu t it was a bad thing, so we Œ on 
that Œ on that note then, we learned about 
that basically. And then
 Œ then after that, 
the next day or so came our
 continuing trip on into 
Germany
 farther. To go and 
pick that up, we left during the day, six 
by sixes again, the same tru cks, parallel 
down  through 
Cologne
 itself and then on south to 
Bo nn. 
And we™re going th rough

Bonn
, later of course, the capitol of the west Œ 
West Germany
, a ba Œ interesting 
old town. I remember from Aunt
 Agnes™ [indecipherable] 
that was the birthplace 
of
 Beethoven
, here are these things coming back. We wo und up someth Œ south of 
Bonn
 and th en onto a pontoon bridge to cross the 
Rhine
. We crossed the 
Rhine 
then at a pontoon bridge. We could se
e to the south what were called the 
Drachenfels,
 that™s part of that Œ tha Œ of th
e other Wagnerian business. And there 
were Œ there were Œ there were barrage 
balloons farther south. We learned later 
that™s the point where the first br
idge had been cap
tured across the 
Rhine
 at 
Remagen
, it™s quite a way south, but we sa
w the balloons. Then Œ now by th is 
time we were really now on the east side of the 
Rhine
 and moving deeper into
 
Germany
. We crossed several remarkably interesting roads, because they were 
a u to ba hns
 that had built, you know, by the 
Reich
 in Œ and the Germans in the 
1930™s as Œ as big work  projects. We cr
ossed them. So we got the ti Œ we got the 
word 
autobahn
 right away. But farther into 
Germany
 we began seeing mo re 
signs of combat. There were dest
royed tanks, American tanks and 
[indecipherable]
 tanks, too. We went thro ugh,
 oh I would say some 60 miles or 
so east, a major town called 
Siegen, s-i-e-g-e-n
, and th en we turn ed north  up into 
what was called the 
Ruhr
 pock et, called that because about a week  or 10 days 
before, two major American armored thru sts, armo red divisions had moved east 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

45
parallel to each other, about 
60 - 70 miles apart, betw
een them being the German 
Ruhr,
 which was the great industrial area, and is, actually. 
Düsseldorf, Duren, 
Essen 
and so forth. Then, as these two armo
red thrusts went east, they began to 
come together in out at area called 
Paderb orn, p-a-d-e-r-b-o-r-n-e
. They joined. 
That became within that
, what was called the 
Ruhr 
pocket. Then the plan 
apparently  was that they would Œ Amer
icans, we would bring in reinforcing 
divisions along wh ere those two big pincers Œ 
p-i-n-c-e-r-s 
had come together. 
The divisions would then, on the south side 
turn to the north, on 
th e north  side turn 
to the south and gradually converge to co
me together to eliminate th e pocket. We 
were one of those divisions. 
Other divisions were the 78
th
, the men of the eighth 
division, I™ll come back that, that we had 
re-reinforced Œ repla
ced, they come into 
the pocket. The 97
th
 division was there, on the sout
h side. We were taken to a 
small town called 
Zi m m e r s b a c h
(ph) 
z-i-m-e-r-s-b-a-c-h Œ z-i-m-m-e-r-b-a-c-h
. 
Small, tiny, tiny town. We were billeted 
in a house, a great, huge manure pile out 
in front, typically of Œ of a Œ of a Œ of a German peasant area. A comfortable 
house, so we Œ we Œ it was good becaus
e we Œ the guys could find eggs and we 

fried eggs and so  we were there a ma
tter of two or three days getting final 
togetherness and getting thin
gs ready. I remember nearby, it was a Sunday, we 
attended church, and one of the medics
 we had was a Œ a very accomp lished

organist who played  the German organ 
there. I remember seeing in the front 
cemetery of the church there was some 
Œ some Œ some graves wh ich had been  
obviously German soldiers 
buried there, I mean they 
[indeciphera ble]
 where they 
were buried. Then Œ then we 
left that area, April eighth 
of 1945, we were taken by 
our six by sixes in the final Œ the final st
retch Œ or we™re Œ we
™re hiking, we™re Œ 
we are on foot, into a wooded area, because
 we™re getting ready to take off, as we 
say, if we jump off in th
e attack the next day. So 
we™re rowt Œ right up Œ right 
practically at the front. And spent the night 
there in bivouac, not tents, we just s-
slept outside, basically. And then early th
e next mo rning we Œ we jump ed off in 
the attack. That would have been April 
ninth now, of 1945. 
To th e north  Œ nor-
northwest actually, into th
e pock et. Then, next seve
ral days, our first major 
incursion into the area,
 the area was called 
Sauerland, s-a-u-e-r-l-a-n-d
. 
Sauerland
, o n e  wo rd , 
l-a-n-d
, because apparently the soil was Œ was Œ of all 
strange things to know Œ but it was ve
ry rugged country
, wooded. I-I-In the 
infantry we say, excellent defensiv e 
terrain for the defender, huh. We moved 
through it. Not much was happening, 
however. The Germans were pulling back, 
there was some occasional firefights ther e, not much. And I remember several 
times there, we Œ we did experience Ge
rman mortars coming 
in as they were 
defending, but not Œ not a great deal. It 
was a fast push, beca
use we would be on

the way most of the time. We Œ at nighttime we™d grab a few hours sleep if we 
could, maybe in a Œ in a Œ in a Œ I reme
mb er sleeping one night on the Œ on the Œ 
on th e Œ on the kitchen floor. Another nigh
t we were Œ and that was lucky, we 
were in a barn, and they had some straw.
 But pretty mu ch we were pushing. And 
that would have been Monda
y we jumped off, Tuesday th
at way. And then it was 
on Wednesday, wh ich was April 11
th
 wh en we began Œ I si Œ reme mber seeing a 
sign in gothic print, 
Attendorn, a-t-t-e-n-d-o-r-n
, three 
k-ms
 ahead. And that was 
when  we began really approaching 
Attendorn
 and that™s Œ that was our first major 
combat. 

Q: And you Œ 
A: We were on the reverse, or south side 
of a hill, in strength,
 meaning we were Œ 
we were Œ we were actually well re
inforced, the whole thing. We Œ 
A
 company at 
that time w as the Œ was in the lead. To explain, I am the lead. Normally in a 
battalion, if the battalion, for example is
 committed, two companies would be side 
by side, the third in reserve. And the same
 with two bi Œ there might be two ba Œ 
battalions there, and the third in reserve. At that time
 A
 company then, we Œ we 
were leading in the attack
 into this town called 
Attendorn
. And the result was, up 
the hillside, I remember th
en around the c Œ as we ma
de the curve on a roadway 
and began work ing thro ugh the trees
, we looked across and there was a 
treeburst
 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

on the distant hill. Let me explain 
treeburst
. Artillery shells are so constructed, 
either number one, they™re 
solid shells, or secondly 
explosive shells. Explosive 
shells are o n es that have a very sensitiv
e tip on the end. And the minute that even 
touches any object, even a twig, it would e
xplode. Very  sen Œ and in a fa Œ in an 
artillery barrage, if the barrage is going in
to wooded area, as it 
would hit the trees, 
it™d break and th at™s called a 
treeb u rst
. Very, very dangerous because of the Œ the 
shell Œ shrapnel just spins right down. Th
at was at a distance though, but Œ I™m 
speaking to you. Then we cam
e around the top of
 the hill and then 
ahead of us, red 
tile roof and so on, was this very sizable town, which was 
Attendorn. 
We came 
up th rough Œ I si Œ the comp any, I mean 
basically, I remember we™re coming past 
some of the units of our cannon comp a
ny, the cannon comp any and Œ the cannon 
company is a large, self prope
lled, it™s a one-oh-five. Lieutenant
 Greenburg
(ph) 
of our company at that particular time
, was our assistant comp any co mmander, but 
he also has some direction and co ntro
l over the fourth platoon, the weapons 
platoon, he was helping on that too.
 Weapons platoon then  began setting up 
machine gun for so-called covering fire 
because then we got the order and our 
platoon, third platoon bega
n going down a rather steep hill on the run, on the 
double, rifles up well, ther-there ha Œ we call 
porter, 
to attack the town. And then 
we began getting a lot of fire from the Germans 88s. We learned afterwards that

the entire 
Ruhr
 was so much attacked by allied airc
raft th at they had a tremendous 
amount, the Germans, of anti-aircraft mate
rial. 88s and 20-20s. When  there were 
no longer these air attacks because the 
stage the war, they would simply level 
those and use against the aca Œ ca Œ oncomi
ng Americans. So we had a lot of Œ a 
lot of 88s coming in, artillery. There was a 20 millimeter 
ak-ak
, and as we started 
down the hill, 3
rd
 platoon began taking casualties.
 We had a sergeant who was 
killed, our lieutenant was injured. Several ot
hers were injured do
wn the late Œ way, 
too, basically. This was, as I said, our fi
rst real experience of combat. And it™s a 
strange thing. You™re there, it™s happening
 to you, and yet fo
rtunately, because of 
the discipline you™ve had, you Œ you™re 
scared, right down in  the pit of your 
stomach, but Œ but y-y-you do 
it, you go on. Then  into  th
is house right nearby Œ I 
sa Œ I say, then, a numb er of us. And th en 
Dave Sargent
(ph) Œ Sergeant
 Dave, 
a 
sergeant, I remember, was outside, he said
 okay, because then the next thing we 
had to do out of the house, 
Dave 
directed us down  the hill, we went on down  the 
hill to cross a river, a small stream, wais
t high. Cold, though. Up the other side 
basically and I Œ I Œ I™d had Œ I for
got, basically, but my  sergeant says, 
Pete
, 
you™re the first one across. So I crosse
d the river, up onto the other side, cold, 
rifles held high to keep them dry, a
nd there was sniper fire coming in over the 
railroad. Then across the railroad, we go
t across okay, but you get Œ for the first

time you™re getting some vicious snapping
 Œ you know, th-the
 Œ or sniping, 
around. Then it seems that the German
s mu st have pulled out. We learned 
however, later on, that one of our men, f
ourth platoon was asked and did, because 
he had good German, go in  w
ith a white flag and their 
at Œ their Œ see if they 
surrender. The co mp any man who thought th
ey might. They  wouldn™t. The name 
was 
Bob Oelke, o-e-l-k-e
. The Germans ignored the white flag, grabbed him, 
tossed him in the cellar. With presence 
of mind he went into the next room, 
because they tossed in
 some grenades after him, he was alright, he later escaped. 
But that we learned later. Into the town
 and then we began moving th rough. We, 
meaning the third platoon, we were still 
there. Now, at that time, as we moved 
along, by this time it™s prob
ably  three, four in  the afternoon. Cobblestone streets, 
rifles on the ready, covering each other. Th
is is called a mopping
 up operation. But 
the Germans seemed to have pulled out Œ I mean, I don™t reme mb er anything mo re 
at that time. And it was then, as we were going up this cobblestone street 
[indecipherable]
 that we approach ed a factory 
area. Obviously th ere was some Œ 
and then  behind this barbed wire fenc
e were these people, unkemp t, dirty, 
emaciated and 
Mac Œ
 I™m sorry, 
MacGilvery
(ph), in charge, I was behind him, 
went up and opened the gate. Now, at th
is point I mu st explain th at for some 
reason, for some reaso n , I do not personally recall 
Mac 
opening the gate, but I

have talked to him, I say
 Ma c 
is Sergeant 
MacGilvery
(ph) of 
Dallas, Texas.
 He Œ 
he had detail Œ details I™d forgotten. Stra
nge about memory, some
 things you Œ but 
Mac 
is very explicit that he™d
 opened the gate. The peop
le were in there. They 
realized apparently we™re Americans, uni
fo rms ra Œ they began crowding out and 
Œ and Œ an d Œ and Œ and trying to embrace 
us, and Œ and Œ and kiss us apparently. I 
don™t recall that. But one thing that wa
s pervasive apparently, and this was 
confirmed by Œ by sar Œ
 Dave Sargent, 
there at the time
, 
sergeant
 
and later on by 
Lieutenant Œ then Lieutenant, now Captain
 Greenburg
(ph), horrible, heavy, heavy 
stench and odor. Again, I Œ this I didn
™t recall and I™m surprised because I™m 
normally pretty aware of olfactory things. Bu t it was there, amb Œ obviously. Wh at 
I do recall though now, very clearly, my se
lf. We had gone into a nearby building, 
because 
Ma c™s
 determination was we gotta Œ go
tta watch out for whate Œ there 
might be 
kra u ts
 around. 
Kraut 
being the derogative name for German. There 
might be 
kra u ts
 here, they gotta check it out. 
And I reme mb er stepping in to the 
build ing now, and I think it Œ it was a la
rge room, maybe 50 by 50 or so. And I do 
remember there were Œ there were some
 bodies lying around and I rememb er 
Mac
 
started to walk over across the room
. Now, in his detail, Sergeant 
MacGilvery
(ph), 
Ma c
 said that there was a skull that he recognized, it Œ he Œ he™s 
from 
Texas.
 It was horse™s skeleto n . And walk
ed over. This I remember too, beca

Œ he walk ed  over and there was an old Œ 
to me appeared to be an  old wo man, 
crouched down , holding so mething. And Œ and 
Mac
 was over there, paused for a 
moment, came back, fury in
 his eyes and said, now I™m being explicit. Those 
goddamn fucking 
krauts,
 look how th ey treat these poor
 sons of bitches. The lady 
is scraping out that horse™s 
skull for food and eating it. Gee, well. He also said, 
forget about the goddamn  horse, they™v e sc
raped all the meat off th at too. There 
was a heavy Œ I remember it now, this at 
Œ there was a heavy odor and Œ and we 
walked past and Œ and there was a body. I™m 
not sure dead or a
live, but Œ but Œ but 
Mac
 pointed out the face and he Œ he Œ look at
 that poor son of a bitch™s legs, they 
were Œ they were apparently gangrenous 
and this heavy odor mu st have been 
putrid-putri-putrefaction, I™m guessing. Back
 out into the stre
et, fresh air thank 
God, because all the other Œ and on back 
out and I remember we got back out in 
the street and as our patrol got back ou
t there, somebody behind me was throwing 
up, one of our guys 
be Œ just Œ just the impact of it. And 
Mac
 said, and I did 
remember this, that a lot of Œ they we
re laborers mostly, 
whatever, you know 
[indecipherable]
 people were out in the street, th
ey just kind of wandered out, the 
gate was open. A Œ an  officer came along 
an d advised that we had to  get them 
back inside because they needed attention, whateve
r. And they could not be 
wandering the street b y  themselves, so 
some how, and I don™t recall, they mu st

have been herded  back  in, because after 
that then we Œ we moved ahead and we 
were on our way after that. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit more about th
at experience before we move ahead. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you try to talk to
 any of these prisoners? 
A: Not Œ not that I remember. N o w, in 
my  Œ in Œ in  my  notes Œ and I mention 
notes because Œ I-I mu st go ahead, I™ll fast
 Œ fast forward a moment. When we had 
gotten back from 
Europe
, we had a 30 day Œ a 30 day fu
rlough. We were the first 
division back from
 Europe
, big welcome, but we have 
30 days. And during that 
time I sat d o wn and typed out my Œ a log. No
w in Œ in that log that I have Œ I-I got 
it Œ well, of course, it was so fresh then
. I c Œ I could do it day by day and th e 
towns, the names of towns and guys names. 
I showed  basically in that Œ and if I 
may refer for a moment to this. This Œ this
 isn™t my  original log. And tu rning now 
on it to April 11
th
, and here we are at 
Attendorn
. I am showing here things that 
I™ve touched upon quite a bit before, some othe
r details that don™t relate to this, but 
as to this particular matter, through th e h
ouses, as we™re going up the street, into 
the town . Pillbox warehouses, first platoon to
 our right flank, went through houses, 
capture of a German 
ak-ak
 crew in the photo shop. 
West and south along the

the factory into Œ I 
[indecipherable]
 a Russian prisoner enclosure. Now, whether 
we were told they were Russians, I have
 no recollection o-of the Œ I wouldn™t 
know Ru ssian probably, well if I Œ you kn
ow, I could guess, but Œ wh en I™d heard 
it basically. And I don™t recall a
ny conversation with the people. 
Q: Did any of them try to touch you? 
A: I don™t Œ I don™t recall that, but 
Mac
 in his recitation says that they were trying 
to grab us and so  forth. We probably pu
shed them off. Again, this heavy, terrible 
odor, and Œ and Œ and Lieutenant 
Greenburg
(ph) who was there at the time, an d I 
hadn™t realized this, he said it was cau
sed probably , mo stly
 from lot of Œ the 
latrines. The latrines w ere only ditches dug 
there, said captain, about 30 - 40 feet 
long, full of excrement and Œ an-and Œ an
d other elimination that caused this 
terribly heavy odor that was there. But as
 far as Œ I don™t recall the touching, but
 
Mac
 says that they were
 trying to grab us. 
Q: Were they wearing civilian clothes? 
A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Th-These were not
 Œ these were not prison type uniforms 
at all. They just seemed to be, as I re
member, just civilian clothes, but rags Œ 
ragged, torn and so forth. 

Q: These were men and women. Were 
there any young people, or mo stly Œ 
A: I do not recall Œ 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

55
Q: Œ age-wise? 
A: Œ seeing any 
young people. Now
 Ma c
 mentions that there was an episode, a 
part of that we left there, said he that
 there was a woman who apparently it was a Œ 
had been a prisoner, who Œ who apparently
 was Œ was getting at
 and be-beating up 
a German woman who may have been a guard.
 Now, as near as Œ apparently there 
were both men and women th
ere. Whether they were housed together, I-I have no 
idea. 
Q: How long were you there? 
A: Not lo ng. My own recoll
ection was that Œ that our Œ our going into  the room 

where the Œ the horse™s skeleton was, probably three, ma ybe five minutes at the 
outside, because it was, as I  said, 
Mac
 got right over, saw wh at
 it was, and we just 
left pretty quickly. There were no German 
soldiers at all to run Œ th ere Œ there Œ 
there Œ the Germans had pulled out apparen
tly Œ apparently. So we were out of 
there within oh, I™d say probably five 
minutes. A little longer, then  probably  get 
out of the compound
, back out on the street a g ain. 
Q: Did you try to feed any of
 them? Give them any food? 
A: Not too my  knowledge. No
t to my knowledge. The s
ituation has been really 
defined by Lieutenant, now Captain
 Greenburg
(ph) quite well. When, as we look 
at it in the contex t of that whole day, we
 had had a drastic experience coming in. I

56
mean, the Œ we Œ th-the fighting and so  
forth, and the weapon
ry. And Œ and Œ and 
this was just one other part of it, and 
Œ and it did not really assume any great 
importance until a more recent time, wh
en we realize now, seeing what was 
happening elsewhere in 
Germany
, the scenes we™ve seen
 of the death camps. 
Now, there were Œ I™m told Œ historians
 Œ a good friend who™s 
an historian says 
that there were no death camps up in the 
Ruhr.
 Slave labor camp s only, wh ich Œ 
which apparently the German
s had established the industry to set little satellite 
areas where prisoners would be
 required that th Œ th-the labors to build parts or 
something of that type, which would then
 be taken in and used by the German 
industry in the 
major cities of 
Düsseldorf,
 whatever. But that was a part of Œ of the 
whole program. But, backing in to their 
appearance, there was emaciation basically 
and Œ and Œ and Œ and Œ but 
the Œ but the Œ that the cl
othes, they were wearing 
rags, tags, but they were not uniforms, 
as I recall. Just n o t uniform types. 
Q: Was it a frightening experience for you to
 see people in this kind of condition? 
A: Very different. Different. I don™t know
 that it was any mo re frightening th an 
what we™d  already had, I mean in the co
mb at side of it, you know, from the firing 
and so forth. I-I think Œ I think it was ju
st, we accepted it, but without really 
paying a great deal of attention to it at th
e time. I mean, it was there, we saw, it 

was there basically it was bad, it was horrible. 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
57
Q: Did it make a difference to 
you that these were civilians? 
A: It was different in the sense that th
e Œ the Œ these were not comb atants, not 
combatants, and how they could be used 
that way, later on upon reflection, you 
realize, yeah. At the time, 
that™s the way it was, but th
en you begin to think about 
it afterwards and yeah , there™s a part of th
e Œ the incongruity of 
it, I mean, the fact 
that they were simply 
civilians, I would say.  
Q: You said wh en you walked out, one of
 your fellow soldiers got nauseous. Did 
you all talk about wh at you had just seen
? Did anybody say anything to the other 
person? 
A: Oh, th e usual. The usual oaths and so fo rth and expressions of you know, to put 
it bluntly , 
Jesus Christ
, what the hell are we seeing, what was Œ well, all Œ all Œ  all 
Œ all Œ without going Œ becoming too explicit,
 but you get the idea, I mean, gee, I 
mean, my God, it Œ it was Œ it was an incr
edible thing, yeah. I suppose the Œ the 
passage of years puts a Œ puts a different 
comp lexion on it. I know that Œ that as 
far as other parts of combat, guys were kille
d, we recognized it, accepted it. And I 
realized, it wasn™t until maybe after getting ho
me, the 30 day span of time, it really 
began to come back of what we had been
 through and seen. I wonder if probably 
in that situation you Œ you 
Œ you develop a sort of an 
inurement to that. I-I know 
that was our discipline, held us together
 despite the fear, the terror. And Œ and Œ

and Œ and Œ and to be, for exam
ple in a Œ in a -- an artiller
y barrage is a Œ is Œ is Œ 
is Œ is a gut grinding Œ yo
u know, experience. But we we
re there, and Œ and Œ and 
it was a part of it. Some guys Œ we ha
d a few that Œ that chickened out, that 
couldn't handle it. My sergeant 
Œ not Œ not Œ well, not Œ not 
Ma c
, he was fine, but 
my  own squad sergeant, we got through 
Attendorn
, if this is a part of what you 
want, we were talking about, we got through 
Attendorn
 to the other side, came 
back on th e same railroad 
again, dropped down  to 
take a few minutes break 
basically, and then Sergeant 
Ma rkso n
(ph) from
 Iowa
, good chap, and my own 
sergeant, 
George Evans
 just flopped down . 
George 
was ashen. He said, I can™t 
take this shit, he says, I Œ I can™t do it. 
Bud 
came down pretty Œ he said
, George
, 
God damn it, you got the stripes, this is our
 job. And maybe that did it, but Œ but Œ 
but Œ but he Œ geor Œ he was out of it. 
Now, I think he got put back  togeth er 
himself a lit Œ later on. But Œ but at the 
time, he couldn™t. It
 happened, and you 
couldn™t Œ from unexpected persons, it ha
-happened. You woul
d have expected 
some others, who you think mi
ght be washouts, did well. It Œ it Œ it Œ th-there™s no 
rule of thumb. But that was a particular 
experience at that time. You speak about 
the matter of what we had seen and so fo
rth. I-I don™t know, there wasn™t a lot of 
discussion afterwards, we went thro ugh it, that was it. Other things were taking

priority. I mean, you know, your own safe
ty and your own welfare and what was 
going to  happen next.  
Q: And then  wh at did happen
 next? You left the town  of
 Attendorn
 and then  
what? 

A: We stayed there that night. We finish
ed through the town 
probably by six, 
seven o™clock. We were assigned there and 
the next thing that they Œ that the Œ 
Captain 
Mitchell
 did was to establish a guard 
perimeter around the hills around 
the town. So the no
r Œ the north  hilltop. And Sergeant 
Ev ans
 and my self and 
Frank Horn
 went up to one hilltop and were th
ere that night. And that-that was 
the night later on that we got machine gun 
fire in the black of
 the night and Œ and 
in the topography of it, on the hilltop,
 George
 above me and to th e north , 
F ra nk 
Horn
 above me a bit and to  the south,
 and I was down. Machine gun fire, 
George 
was Œ was killed almost immediately and 
Frank
 so badly shot up in th e back, he Œ 
tha-that Œ that Œ back  to battalion aid and 
died several days later, I guess. All I got, 
a Œ incredibly fortunate, just
 a flesh wound in my Œ in the Œ my Œ in my left leg . 

Q: You are 19 years old, ho
w did you feel Œ ho
w old did you feel after that day 
and that night? 
A: I didn™t realize what had happened ab out getting a Œ th-th-the 
[indecipherable]
 
my leg, until the next morning. We came 
off the hilltop that ni
ght. Our Œ our Œ our

d. My captain, Captain

 with me, we™ve had 
[indecipherable]
 we talked about that this 
mo rning. He was describing some of the th
ings that happened to him, so Œ these 
close calls. Friend he had been in  
OCS
 with was killed with a 
treeburst
 about 
three or four feet away from him. And as 
I told him, I said, Captain, I can Œ I can 
sit here and right now, I ca Œ I can hear Œ I can hear 
George
 gurgling as he was 
dying. I can hear Œ I can hear 
Frank
 Œ wh en

 That Œ th at was a mo rphine

 it Œ he Œ he co Œ he could name it

 right there. So, it could co me right back, I don™t know th at there 
was any particular sig n  of aging at the

Richard Peterson.
 This is tape number two, 
side 
B.
 And you were talking ab out your re
action to the Œ that day and night. 
A: A-As commented, I think Œ 
I think that at the time there is a Œ there Œ there is 
an insulation, I suppose, that is given yo
u by your Œ your disc
ipline that you have, 
to a degree. Other things become so dras
tic that you Œ something I suppose, maybe 
mentally helps block them out. To get 
through them you have to. Maybe, as I 
suggested, it was only after getting back  in
 a peacetime setting like the Œ our har Œ 
our months furlough. And I remember it 
happened wh en  I was home, after we™d 
gotten back from 
Europe
, th-the month between, we we
nt back several times, I ca 
Œ I kind of Œ and I-I-I know that the 
death of a couple guys swept back. 
George, 
Frank™s
 did, some others we had then too, the Œ just the Œ the Œ th e Œ the 
immensity of it. After those experience
s, you™re do Œ you do have dreams and 
nightmares. I had Œ it™s diminished greatly 
over the years, but after first getting out 
of the service, an-and let me just finish 
perhaps by the German experience, we had 
that then. Then we also ha
d some more drastic experience. We were the second 
company, the second Amer
ican company in the wh
ole army to cross the 
Da nube
 
farther south. A comp any from the 103
rd
 division to th e southwest, crossed in the 
mo rning of the 26
th
, and we crossed the night of the 26
th
, so by Œ by an English

[indecipherable]
. And we lost a number of people 
there, and a lot of Œ quite a few 
wounded. So me wounded. But it™s after 
then as I discovered, getting back over 
there, I would have occasi
onal dreams that would be 
quite frightening. I™d wake. 
They ™ve diminished. And yet even now I do 
have a recurrent dream which is that Œ 
either Œ I™m either going to 
be going in to the army  again,
 or I™m in the army again. 
And I find that I have a feeli
ng of concern, of fear, if 
you please. And terribly glad 
to wake up to realize th at it is not ha
ppening ag ain. That i Œ that has come 
sometimes. The most drastic thing rece
ntly was to have seen the movie ﬁ
Sav ing  
Private Ryan.ﬂ
 Now, I™ve talk
ed to my company Œ Captain
 Greenburg
(ph), he™s 
seen it too. Every Œ every comb at veteran I™ve talked to has had a similar 
experience, some more, some less, but Iremember, to see it, the first oh, five 
minutes is in the cemetery, but then Œ th
en  you begin Œ then 
one begins seeing the 
beginning of 
D-Day
 with the small craft, the la
nding craft coming in. Now, we 
were not 
D-Day
 of course, but we did have th
e training in amphibious. And it was 
a remarkable thing because as I w atched th
at in the darkened theater Œ my sa Œ 
Pat 
wa Œ wife 
Pat 
did not go. As I watched that and 
Œ and Œ and Œ and the camera, for 
those who will see it recall that you saw 
th e boats from the side and then th at 
moved over and panned righ
t into the boat itself, and 
you™re looking at the men.

was like it was our platoon goin

ro wing up around you. The gear all just 
the same, basically. And I began to cry, 
just this weeps and 
then when, in the 
picture, the craft hit th e shore, the ramp 
went down, typical training, and then  the 
German artillery, the mortars opened up,
 machine gunning the whole Œ I found 
my self audibly crying, I couldn™t help 
it. And I Œ I™ve Œ I Œ I Œ I have a free 

sample, Ca ptain
 Greenburg
(ph) who you 
[indecipherable]
 have met said he had 
the same experience. That he Œ he had th
at happen. He Œ he 
w Œ he was weeping. 
And to drop back to our experience, 
the lieutenant who had taken the platoon 
across the 
Rhine
 th at I spoke of earlier, who 
had both the command responsibility 
of that group, a terrible burden to  ta
ke back. After our first reunion of our 
comp any, he attended, it wa
s back in Œ okay, it was 
Council Bluffs
, my home. We 
had them there in 90 Œ ™95 and ™9 7. In 
™95 fo r the first time, cap Œ Lieutenant
 
Henry 
came. Now a doctor in 
Dallas
, a Œ a very, very fine, but rather sensitive. 
And we visit a lot and he talked about 
that experience, the patrol across the 
Rhine
. 
I had for Lieutenant
 Hen r y ,  
after he got back home, a very gracious letter 
thanking us for Œ my  wife and I. But he went on to  say, the value it was to him to 
visit with comrades-in-arms of years ago, 
to just hear about, that Œ th at it Œ he 
understood things better and that it relie
ved from his should 
Œ from his shoulders

the burden of guilt that he™d felt all thes
e years. One good thing about reunions, 
they helped. I talked to him, we were 
at ak Œ our division reunion in newy Œ 
Louisville
 last September and he™d  seen the 
movie and he said it Œ I shouldn™t 
have, he said, it put me back again. So I 
think seeing the par Œ again, after all these 
years, it comes back. And you 
wonder Œ what little I read 
of psychology on it, they 
Œ we™re told  in psychology that Œ that thes
e memories are latent, th at certain things 
can trigger them off. Example, the Œ th
e Œ the smell, the odor. I can stand on a 
street corner today, pass those Œ a diesel
 bus and th e diesel fumes take me right 
back to our training days when  the Œ the 
diesel of the outfit. And yet on the other 
hand, come back to it, I don™t remember
 anything about the terrible stench at 
Attendorn. 
Strange. And I don™t know. My one 
thought, it might be that Œ who 
can tell about these things? It may have be
en  a reaction to wh at Œ that night, later 
on when  we were close to death, or the ot
hers were close to death and sa Œ I Œ I 
don™t know. I-I Œ I-I do not have the wisdom to answer that. 
Q: Your Œ you™re saying 
th at one may have superseded  the Œ the fo llowing? 
A: I Œ I Œ yeah, I Œ I Œ I Œ I don™t know. I don™t know. 

Q: Where were you when President
 Roosevelt 
died? 
A: Very interesting question because we 
learned about it, it was the day after the 
12
th
 of course, after the night the bad Œ we 
were Œ we were in Œ we were in Œ in

reserve at that time in 
Attendorn
. And I remember that they
 Œ th ey kind of got us 
all together basically and we
 had the Œ had this word th at Œ that he died, and I 
remember it was, who the hell is 
Harry Truman
? I didn™t ta Œ he™s our new 
president is who he is. We know Œ we di
dn™t know mu ch about him basically, but 
it was Œ it was Œ you know, it Œ it was Œ it wa
s different. Of course you Œ I™ve seen 
Œ we™ve all seen the pictures of, in this 
country when all the Œ all the Œ the Œ the Œ 
the Œ the weeping, I mean, and then Œ an
d the Œ and th e sorrow and so forth. I 
don™t think, frankly, it made a lot of di
ffer Œ I mean, he Œ so be it, I mean, it 
happened Œ 

Q: Wasn™t a sense that you had lost your co mmander in chief? 
A: No, I Œ no, no, no. Things
 were gonna go 
on, you know. 
Q: And then  wh at Œ wh at did happ
en to finish up your experience? 
A: We had passed that in 
Duren
 and then as I said, we 
were transferred then, the 
pocket was finished, closed. We went by mo to r march at night. We were 

transferred from the first army
 to the third. And the firs
t night going down in the 
black of the night, one of the trucks we nt off the road, not ours. We had several 
men killed quite a few injured on the 
[indecipherable]
 down and then we went to 
Œ in the area called 
Franco nia
. Went thro ugh 
Würzburg
 in 
Franconia
. We™re 
there and then we Œ then we 
jumped off in the 
attack again. By this time we were

in 
Patton™s
 third army, transferred. Went do
wn through the area, cities of 
Eichstätt
, to 
Ingolstadt. Ingolstadt
 was more trouble, was difficult. The back  Œ 
Q: As you were m
oving, did you see a
ny civilians, any Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ 
DP s
, any Œ 
A: Quite a bit. 

Q: What was that like for you? 
A: 
DPs
 as well, too. As we move
d farther down and got into
 Bavaria
, we saw 
quite a few mo re civilians. And saw 
quite a few displaced persons, as you 
mentioned. On th e roads, moving, traveli
ng, wh erever they  might be going. At the 
city, the town of
 Eichstätt
, different because our comp any co mmander Captain
 
Mitchell
 was ill, and then Li
eutenant not Captain
 Greenburg
(ph), then age 22 
took over the company, and he had th
e responsibility of 200 men there were 
[indecipherable]
. And we had Œ we had it
 
Œ a Œ a bad time at 
Ingolstadt
 Œ I take it 
back, at 
Eichstätt. 
Got Œ got quite a bit of Œ of resistance there. Then on down 
towards the major city of 
Ingolstadt,
 which we were told was the hometown of 
Heinrich Himmler
, expect defense. Well, it Œ I™m not sure if it w as with 
Himmler
 or not, but there was a Œ going in to 
In go l s t a d t
 was not the bad, but 
that™s the night we crossed the
 Danube.
 There was resi st ance 
there and that was a 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

67
Œ a pretty drastic night, to get in and get 
across basically, cross 
the river. As I said, 
we were th Œ we were the Œ we were 
the second co mp any of the Americans to go 
cro Œ I mean, a Œ the whole American ar
my to cross, apparently. We got a 
counterattack that night, got some Œ oh, we
 had a number who were killed, two or 
three killed, I think, and quite a few wo
unded. And that™s one of the nights one 
realizes how thin is the veneer of civ
ilization, by which I mean this. I remember 
that I was the Œ I was the platoon runner
 by that time, sort of ran messages 
between the company command posts, 
CP
 and our Œ where we were, some Œ oh, 
some blocks away. In the black of the ni
ght the Germans had co me in, and the ka 
Œ and then  several were wounded. And I 
rememb er going past and this Œ this 
German was crying, he says, I am 
blessé
, well, French for woun Œ well, be Œ any Œ 
and I remember I Œ I said Œ I just Œ I said, 
[speaks German]
 shut up. I mean, I Œ 
no co mp assion at all on my  part, huh? Yeah , I mean, you know, just Œ that was it. 
And you realize that yeah, I suppose that™s
 our training and to 
Œ basically we Œ we 
couldn™t Œ couldn™t take a chance, that ki
nd of a thing. Maybe he was Œ maybe he 
was just a Œ faking it, who knows? I couldn™t take a chance. That was 
Ingolstadt
 
and then we were there brief, and then afte
r that really, the war was really finish 
up because by that time we were just on 
the move in Œ in Œ or sometimes Œ 
sometimes we were riding tanks and going ou
t ahead, other times mostly in trucks.

Then, within a matter of 
a week we were down in
 Austria,
 we crossed into
 
Austria.
 We Œ we stopped, oh we were
 pro Œ at a small town  called 
Perwang
, 
which is about 20 Œ 
p-e Œ p-e-r-w-a-n-g
, about 20 kilometers north of 
Sa lzburg , 
we were in 
Austria
. And there Œ we were there wh
en the word that the Œ it was 
May seventh or May eighth, take your c
hoice, the war was over. And immediately 
rumo rs began coming, okay you guys, you™re
 already Œ there Œ you™re going to the 
Pacific.
 My God. Well, the thought was bad, 
but in the meantime we realized we 
were gonna have some time at home. So 
indeed that™s what 
happened. We came 
back by truck back to  
Mannheim. 
We were there in
 Man nh eim
 for a time, 
probably  just a few days only in 
Feud enheim
 then truck again back  across 
France
 
to the same tents we were 
in when we first came, in
 Old Gold
. And then Œ th en we 
got new uniforms, got the co
mbat jackets. Pretty spi
ffy stuff, we thought. And 
now getting ready for hom
e. Trucks down to 
LaHavre
. I was mentioning to  
Captain
 Greenburg
(ph) when we talked today, as we were leaving 
LaHavre
 now, 
some roma ntic soul put on the loudspeaker system 
Debussy™s Clair de Lune. 
That was a nice departure. A week back to cross the 
Atlantic
 and then came this 
tumultuous arrival at h o me, because we
 were the first division back from
 Europe
 
and we had the grand welcome. Blimps 
in the sky, fireboats in the Œ in 
New York 
harbor. Great big, huge banner across a 
hill, well done, welcome home. And off Œ

off the ships. Our ship 
had on a great big panel,
 ETO
 to
 Tokyo. 
Well. But we got 
in and my  captain, Captain
 Reed
(ph), we were still 
[indecipherable]
 tell me that 
he Œ his home was 
Hoboken. 
His parents had learned of 
our return and his father 
was able to get around over to the 
Manhattan™s
 ri Œ we Œ I think he s Œ I the 
captain said pier 77 or something. 57. Go
t off and his father was right out there. 
Father shoved and pushed, he Œ right past
 and he bay Œ they 
kissed. Marvelous, 
huh. And even the rest of us, it Œ it 
was treme n dous to come back, our own 
country ag ain. Amazingly Œ I have it here
, but amazingly there were Œ we had 
dignitaries and well wishers, but a lot 
of media. Reporter Œ a reporter from the
 
ﬁDes Moines
 
Registerﬂ
 was there and we had a grea
t big feature, which I still 
saved at home basically, the Œ the 
Blackh awks 
back again and th ey had the Œ the 
name of every Iowan who was coming back
 and Œ and so there were many, ma ny 
happy families. We knew from the 
Register
 at home they knew
 we™d been in 
combat, that™s the fi
rst word, because that had a little
 feature, what they™ve done. 
And they had in the 
Register, 
toward the end of April that the 86
th
 was in combat. 
Course, folks were just terribly tied 
up, terribly tied up. An  amazing thing 
happened, a tragic thing. 
When I Œ we got back to 
Ma nn h e im
, got our mail for the 
first time. My mother had written that sh
e met a good high school 
friend of hers of 
Council Bluffs, 
now in  
Omah a
, th ey got talking and 
her son was in the 86

[indecipherable]
 together, his name was Œ was Captain 
Bruce McAllister
, o f our 
K 
company 
[indecipherable]
 in our regiment. And I remember as clearly sittin g 
as we™re sitting here. I remember sayi
ng to one of our Œ I said, my gosh, 
Wes, 
I Œ 
I™ve got to  look up th is Captain 
McAllister
. He says, 
Pete
, you™re too late. He was 
killed two weeks ago, do
wn on the Œ on the 
[indeciphera ble]
 down the 
Danube
. 
So those things happen. That was Œ now Œ 
Q: When you were leaving 
Europe
 and you were going towards 
LaHav re 
and 
you were Œ 

A: Leaving 
LaHavre
, yeah. 
Q: Yeah, no, but on your way. 
A: Oh, way in, yeah. 
Q: On Œ on Œ on those weeks getting back
 there and you saw civilians and again 
DPs
, and Œ  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ were you aw are of the extent of the 
damage of the war at that point, or were 
you Œ 
A: Well, 
LaHavre Œ 
Q: Œ or ag ain Œ or ag ain aware of the 
camp s? Were you ex  Œ aware of the Œ 
A: Oh, 
LaHavre
 was badly smashed, badly smashed.

Q: But even  on the way to there, you kn
ow, as you were going thro ugh other cities 
to get there. 
A: You mean ye Œ on the way back , you mean Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Œ from Œ yeah. 
Ma nnheim Œ
 well, let me b ack up. War finished we were it Œ 
we were north of 
Sa lzburg .
 Back then by the 
a u to ba hn
, from 
Salzburg
 up to 
Munich Œ Munich 
was badly smashed. I rememb er driving and we™d go over in 
the trucks and Œ and we Œ in Œ in 
Munich
, just Œ 
Q: I Œ I mean the terrible human toll. 

A: Oh, I see, yeah. We were Œ a lot of pe
ople Œ you feel particularly sorry for the 
old people and ch ildren, who are the Œ the 
innocent, I Œ truth is, much as it can be, 
but the children 
[indecipherable]
. And yet interestingly as we™d drive Œ I 
reme mb er driving along in  the trucks, th
ere would be childre
n watching us and 
they would be giving the Nazi salute. Th
ey were taught Œ we were sold Œ they 
didn™t know, we were soldiers, and that 
was enough. But to the civilians we would 
talk. Now when  we came back to 
Feudenheim , 
a suburb of 
Mannheim
, where we 
were billeted, the Germans were there a
nd they Œ they Œ they were all right. I 
mean, they were very sub Œ subservient. 
Get along basically, and of course, what 
little was that there were Œ you never Œ yo
u never met any who were ever Nazis.

Down the street, I heard 
[indecipherable]
 but we were not Œ w-we were not 
political, huh? Typical, typica
l. Whatever Œ how did
 Hitler
 ev Œ ever come to 
power, you™re thinking. None of them, no
ne of them. But it was there, you know, I 
s Œ you know. 
Q: Okay  Œ 

A: O-Other Œ other people Œ let me back up
, if I may. Another experience that I 
remember that was such a re
markable thing. I remember we were on trucks after 
we™d gone through 
Ackstatt Œ Eichstätt,
 heading toward, and 
su ddenly realized 
that Œ that the trucks were being su rro
unded practically by th is wild horde of 
persons in green uniforms. They™re Ru
ssian Œ Russian. Th
ey were Russian, 
released Russian Œ Russian appar Œ I™m so
rry, Russian prisoners of war. And my 
first rec Œ these are like Chinese. Mongo
lians, the whole thing. My Œ my first 

realization, I mean, you read of Œ of wh at 
Russia
 was, I mean, all th is Œ this 
variegated population, in a
ppearance, I mean, the-these were Orientals, basically, 
huh. Then  they moved on b
ack basically, we go to the Œ we would see again Œ a-

again also Œ we came across a number in 
Bavaria
 of allied prisoners, British, who 
were out of ba Œ sent to wo rk on farm
s, huh. Course you know, th -they Œ they  
were Œ they were lucky to be in the co
untry so they had fo
od, you know. Others

didn™t. I don™t rememb er though Œ there were quite a few displaced persons 
moving back. It™s hard to
 get a count, basically. 
Q: Did you see anybody in prison camp
 you Œ concentration camp  uniforms? 
A: No. The on Œ th-they were 
just civilian clothing, basically, that we saw. Now, 
to back Œ go back  to the death camp si
de, though. After we Œ our division, 86
th
, 
was in Œ we were down in 
Austria
, our engineer battalion, I understand, was sent 
over to
 Dach au
. And I had a friend in it, and he Œ 
he Œ he said he Œ again, he™d  
never such  terror in his Œ that™s where you 
had that Œ of course, the slave was bad 
enough, but of course there were others wh
ere you™ve seen the pictures of, they are 
just incredible, incredible. 
Q: By May of ™45, June of ™45,
 had you heard of a place called 
Auschwitz
? 
A: I don™t think that we got the na
mes until later. None 
of them, to my 
recollection, none of them. That seemed to
 come later. B u t then of course, by Œ we 
learned mo re of it during th e fall. By that
 time we had been back home, furlough, 
trained again briefly at 
Gruber
(ph) then came to 
Baums
(ph) and we were sent out 
to the 
Philippines.
 We were in the 
Philippines
 now when the war trials, the 
Japanese were going on. General 
Hawla
(ph) for example, was being tried there. 
We saw a lot of the Œ of the Œ the tales 
of atrocities committed by Œ and they were 
Œ by the Japanese, as they were leaving the 
Philippines
 and that was really Œ that 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

74
was bad. And Œ and of course the same 
time, I™m not exactly
 sure, I think the 
Nuremberg
 trials were in October November, 
maybe, of ™45, right? And so we 
began seeing mo re of Œ in just general,
 news about the information coming out. 
Th-That Œ so mu ch was new that I Œ incredib
le. But I don™t recall prior to that time 
any of the names, basically. 
Q: How long were you in the 
Philippines
? 
A: We got to the 
Philippines
, we Œ we Œ to draw back. We were at Camp
 
Gruber
(ph) for a couple weeks, and then th
e bombs, what was it, like Au gust 6
th
, 
August whatever it was. And naga Œ fi-first of course 
Hiroshima
, then
 Nagasaki
. 
We were on Œ we were on the train s
hortly after that by order. We got to 
San 
Francisco. 
We sailed to 
Sa n F rancisco  
about the last week Œ ne
xt to last week in 
August. Got to the
 Philippines
 about three weeks later and we were there from 
late in September. And the program was this
, that as you were in longer, there was 
a point system, so many points for so ma
ny months. Comb at infantry badge gave 
you 10 ex tra points, a Purp le Heart gave 
you fi Œ by the point system then, you 
see, our particular group was ready to co
me back, and we did, we left in March 
from
 Manila
 to come back, March o-of ™46. We were home a month later. 
Q: And then  wh at did you do? 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
75
A: First of all bought a suit of clothes. No, 
beyond that it was fla Œ great to be back 
home again, of course. Planned to go,
 and I did then begin school. My 
summertime was open. Began school at the Un iversity of 
Iowa
 in Œ in  September 
of ™46, right away. And I finished my  schooling th ere. 
Q: So you went four
 years of university? 
A: I had to go Œ yes Œ es Œ 
I Œ I had Œ well, I had a little bit of a credit from Œ from 
Kansas
, in
 Drake, 
not much. But result was that 
I Œ I took what is called a 
combined schedule of liberal 
arts and law. Your first Œ yo
ur first three years are all 
liberal arts. Then your first year law, 
combined with Œ with
 the other. So you 
actually had the whole thing six years. 
Q: Six years. 
A: I had Œ I went thro ugh th e summertime basically 
[indecipherable]
 so I Œ then I 
finished Œ I finished my  Œ the law s Œ 
law school in June ™51 and to ok the bar. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Then wh at did you do? 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 I went home to 
Council Bluffs, 
I entered my father™s firm. 
Dad was still practicing at the time. And 
practiced with the firm then following 
that time. Met my wife at 
Iowa
, 
Pat
 and I were married in Œ mustn™t forget this, 
August 14
th
 of Œ of Œ of 1949. So 
we has the last two years of school togeth er and 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

76
then came back home and our
 first child was born Octo ber of ™51, and been 
practicing law since that time. In Octobe
r Œ November of 1955, Dad, my father 
was appointed to the 
Iowa 
Supreme Court. After which time then, I was in the 
firm, of course, continued that basically
. And then I made some career changes 
over the years, but I practiced law ever si
nce that time. All Œ all Œ practice of law 
all the time. 

Q: And you are curre
ntly still working? 
A: Yes. 
Q: In a private firm, or Œ 

A: No, no, I Œ well, yeah. I, for a variety of
 reasons left the Œ 
Dad™s law firm, h e Œ 
he was long since gone, in 70 Œ ™75, and 
th en I was a trust officer of Œ of a bank 
for two years. Then 
back in the practice, I practiced
 since that time. First on my 
own, and now with another firm which is 
Telpner, Peterson, Smith and Ruesch
 
in 
Council Bluffs. 
Q: And you™re also a magistrate ju dge? 

A: I™m a part ti Œ i-it™s called 
United States 
Magistrate Judge exactly, it™s a part 
time position. And have Œ and a-actually, in
teresting because I™m Œ  last June I 
finished 40 years of federal service, l
ong. And I think probably  my position is 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

77
going to be fazed out. 
The picture changes. Quite alright, but it™s been Œ it™s been 
fine, so Œ yeah. 
Q: And how many chil
dren do you have? 
A: Three. Daughter in the 40™s, married of
 course. And then th ey
 have Œ they have 
three children. The older son, married and they  have three children and th e 

younger son, married with one child
. So I have seven grandchildren. 
Q: Can we now talk a little bit about some 
of your feelings and reflections about 
what you went through, tho
ugh you have alluded Œ you ha
ve talked about some of 
it already. Do you think you are a diffe
rent person today because of what you 
experienced during the war? 
A: Oh yes, no question. 
Q: And if so, in what way? 

A: As I mentioned before, I think my Œ I 
do not ha Œ had had a rather sheltered 
life, even through high school. I was the 
Œ the so Œ the youngest in the family 
basically and so  forth, and I Œ I think pr
obably  looking back, indulged to a degree. 
But I was typical growing up. There is 
no question though, that being in th e 
military, you™re on the comm
on denominator with a lot 
of other people of all 
different backgrounds, sizes, 
shapes, tempers, the whole th
ing. It™s a very Œ to me 
a very valuable experience. Require a lot of
 self confidence about it, but you get to 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
78
assume mu ch Œ realize so mu ch mo re about people and understanding people 
hopefully. And having served 
as we had in the military, too, it™s a Œ it™s a source of 

satisfaction, and Œ and Œ and 
not to be nostalgic or sentimental about it, but I think 
to me there is a Œ there is a great Œ  a gr
eat value and a great importance of serving 
one™s country. And I think all of us fe
lt that, at least the World War II people 
pretty much. I can™t sp
eak for the other Œ in  
Vietnam, 
different things basically. 
But I think for us it was a source of gratif
ication, satisfaction. I Œ I Œ I know, in 
answer t Œ to answer to the question presen
ted that it Œ that it was a very valuable 
experience for me. 

Q: When your children were 19 and 20, 
the age Œ 19, th-the age that you were 
when you experienced su
ch life threatening ex  Œ you know, mo ments. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Did th at bring back to you in those 
years, when your child
ren were that age, 
what you went through? Did it trigger memo
ries or thoughts of those times? When 
you looked at your 
son and he was 19. 
A: Yeah. I didn™t think that
 much about it. When sons
 were that age we were 
fussing around with  rebel without cause
 kids. We were fussing around with 
musical colleges, what to do. And Œ and at
 that time too, concerns about what life 
was doing to  them, with exposure to drugs an
d so forth. Fortunately that Œ not, but

it-it™s a concern for parents. That wasn™t 
happening th en, I Œ and I never really Œ I 
never really equated them with my  expe
rience very mu ch. And I knew Œ I talked 
to a degree military, the importance of my 
Œ of my experience basic Œ we never 
talked very mu ch about it, though, I 
mean as far as what had happened. 
Q: That was going to be my  next ques
tion. Did you share with them those Œ 
A: Wife 
[indecipherable]
 she would make occasional re
ferences to it, but I Œ all 
to a degree they knew abou
t it, but not until several years ago, which was the 50
th
 
year after 
Attendorn
, the rite of peace, which I ca
ll Œ and then only because I felt 
the time had Œ some Œ generally sp eaking th
ese are things you visit only with your 
buddy Œ your Œ your Œ your 
Œ your immediate friends ab
out. Other veterans to a 
degree too, yeah, but you can really shar
e with those that you served with. You 
have your own
 lingua franca  
that you can go back and 
forth with. And you Œ you 
can share with them, say a 
certain thing and a whole pi
cture comes back. One of

like watching a broken mirror, in the sense 
that the mirror is broken and there are 
certain shards of memory th
at come back. Shards of me
mory like I™ve talked about 
here. Sometimes incomplete. We see Œ we se
e this broken mirror, each of us in a 
different way, because in our combat expe
rience, some of what Œ had the things Œ 
some, for example, what Sergeant
 Mac
 in great detail, hm, things that Œ that for 
some reaso n  or another, now whether Œ wh

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes
 Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with
 Richard Peterson
. This is tape three, side
 A. 
A: We have spoken about my  friend
 Jim McRandall™s
(ph) an alogy of the Œ of Œ 
of Œ of the broken mirror and th e 
shards of memo ry, and Œ and says 
Jim,
 just as 
you cannot effectively reconstruct that mi
rror with the broken sh
ards, some pieces 
are mi ssing, some pieces are quite sharp, to carry on th e Œ the Œ th e metaphor of it. 
But to all of us, to all of us, we can go ba
ck , and in our experien
ce, in this Œ in the 
world in which we live, the Œ the Œ i-in 
my  terms, the crucible of contra Œ of 
combat, you can see and remember the e
xpression a certain fellow had, one of 
your Œ one of your 
G.I.
 buddies on the street corner at a certain time. You can Œ 
you can see or visualize a hillside, or a certain setting where you were and what 
was happening at the time. You can still 
recall the thunk of
 a mortar in the 
distance or the rattle of machine gun fire. 
And they bring back  Œ they Œ they  can 
bring back these things, in
 some bizarre, strange way, but can never be fully Œ 
never fully reconstructed, just as Œ as 
a broken mirror can not be. And what you™re 
seeing in the broken mirror also many times 
is Œ and results of 
being distorted in 
some ways, you know, th-th-the Œ th e diffe
rent angles you™re seeing of it. And Œ 
and Œ and that™s why 
you get with different veterans 
different views of things. The 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

82
Œ the famous story of Œ of the Œ of th
e four blind men blindfolded with the 
elephant. On e, the one leg and th e trunk an
d so forth. And you 
Œ then that™s very 
mu ch the way it is. And Œ and in  Œ in a comb
at situation, the first thing you realize 
is there™s begin Œ it-it™s confusion. I have 
here our division histor
y. And as I read it 
through there are many areas 
Œ history is hard Œ is hard
 to recover accurately and I 
find many th ings that I Œ I ca Œ I describe 
as being garb led in this. It depends who 
one talks to, it depends how it™s reconstruc
ted, and it Œ wh-while there™s a lot of 
good work, at the same time 
there are things that do come
 off wrong. But so be it, 
I mean, tha-that™s a part of the 
problem of reconstructing history. 
Q: Speaking about different perspectives
, do you think it Œ it was an advantage 
that you were so young when  you went th
ro ugh th is, or Œ or would it have been  Œ 
been better to be older? 
A: I think Œ I think better to
 be young because we were young, impressionable, but 
we learned. We did not have
 intense, deep preconception
s of things and we would 
accept discipline better as younger people, I 
think, basically a
nd could be trained 
better, seems to me . And Œ and Œ and Œ an d 
war is not a thing for anybody, but less 
I think older persons than younger. I thi
nk you maybe adjusted better. There was 
so many descriptions of it. One of the best, 
of course, is course the old orig inal, the 

wa Œ the time honored  one of Œ of
 Sherm an
. Another one too that Œ that to Œ to be 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
83
in comb at is looking like Œ you are looking 
like in a window into  hell. A variety of 
things, the base Œ I think maybe as young people we can hopefully, maybe accept 

them more easily than we can a-as older 
Œ I™m not Œ I™ve not followed that too, too 
much, but certainly it Œ it Œ it™s 
for young people. If Œ if Œ if
 you have to be there, a 
younger person.  

Q: Have your Œ or do you 
th ink your religious views are Œ or were in fluenced by 
your brush with death and 
what you saw, the sights yo
u saw during the war years? 
A: I Œ I will say this, I mean, we were Œ 
we Œ we had religious training in the 
background basically, but you have the impon
derable question, in our experiences. 
You™ve got people killed right
 beside you, the Œ the Œ 
the question, why them and 
not me? It™s an unanswerabl
e question and Œ an-and still 
after all these years, I 
puzzle. An-And th-there is no solution 
to that, no answer. I-I think maybe the 
religious faith, you know, faith in God, of 
course, in the hereafter if we™re going to 
accept that, is important. S Œ 
but apropos of the matter of
 Œ of how to reason it out, 
it ca Œ it cannot be reasoned out. You see 
too many things wh ere there is no reason 
of why things happen or shouldn™t happen in
 combat. You see brutality where it 
shouldn™t be. You see incredible cruelty. 
Yo u see some of the best guys are Œ are 
taken, killed, and other dunde
rheads, pardon the expression, seem to skin through. 
Th-There Œ there i Œ there is no logic to it.
 And yet, and yet ther
e is an incredible 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

84
attraction to it. Strange, isn™t 
it? We Œ we™ve seen the movie
 ﬁPatton
ﬂ 
[indecipherable]
 well, we don™t love him, but 
Œ but it™s undeniab le and many, 
many, many people feel this, that
 there is an incredible th
rill in that situation, if 
you come through. If you come through. We
 can look back and see things, there is 
Œ there can be Œ there can be, strangely, a gr
eat exhilaration in Œ in Œ in a firefig h t, 
it™s strange. People inflicting death on ot
hers, and here again, the veneer of 
civilization, the old tradition th at when  you
 get your blood up and so forth, it™s the 
strangest thing. You Œ you wa
nt to deny it to yourself, and yet contradictorily it™s 
still there. Strange. Not often, but Œ but mo
re often it Œ more often is a Œ come Œ 
comes the feeling of Œ of the futility of 
it and the Œ and th Œ and the Œ I remem-
memb er co min g  ho me in  my  fu rlo ugh  and  
Œ and during that time, I reme mb er we 
lost some of these guys, tha-that Œ 
that brought me to tears. I think 
[indecipherable]
 good guys, wonderful guys. Why, why, why, huh? Huh? My 
good friend Sergeant
 Smith
, 
Smitty 
was our re Œ machine gun section. They  were 
just laying down  field of fire 
as we were heading down into 
Attendorn
. An 88 
round came in right through the center of 
the house they were in, took th em all out 

and they  were all badly injured. 
Smitty 
partic Œ badly bu Œ 
very badly inju red. 
And of co urse he later on learned 
of our Œ my experience at night.
 Smitty
, in
 
Rochester M-Minnesota
 now, a great, wonderful guy,
 very devout Catholic, go Œ

goes to mass daily. Has had Œ has had some
 bouts with cancer, we™re in close 
touch. We always talk and 
we will talk next Monday on 
Attendorn
 day, the 11
th
, 
we™re there. It™s kind of a contest who calls who first. I-I Œ I catch him before 
mass,  his morning mass, but we talk about 
it a bit and I Œ and I recently said last 
time, I said, 
Smitty
, how you doing with the cancer? He says
 Pete,
 doing fine, but 
he says every day, every day y
ou Œ you Œ you and I have after
 Attendorn
 is a plus. 
That™s right. That™s right. 

Q: What else do you do special on Ap ril 11
th
, besides call him?  
A: Oh, I think that™s basically it. N o , that™s
 the big thing is that, that™s Œ but that-
that-that™s the day. How much l
onger it will happen, I don™t know. 
Q: You also had mentioned that you do
 think about what 
had happen ed mo re 
frequently now. Is that tr
ue as you™re getting older? 
A: I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I think so, yeah. I think that Œ oh, I suppose we get older, maybe 
we begin reflecting more about it. Hate 
to call them the twilight years for gosh 
sakes, but Œ no, but maybe 
Œ and then you re Œ go back  and reflect upon these 
things and Œ and Œ an d rec
ognize what a full life a person™
s had, but Œ and Œ and Œ 
and interestingly enough too, 
Oliver Wendell Holmes,
 the justice, a Civil War 
veteran, combat veteran, injured three tim
es in the war, in the 1890™s was asked to 
give a Memo rial Day talk. And in that Œ a
nd in that he touched upon Œ made this

comment, may Œ maybe you™ve read it before, 
[indecipherable]
. It was our great 
and good fortune that in 
our youth we learned that life was real and life was 
meaningful, powerful 
[indeciphera ble]
 thing. I™m not sure 
about the great good 
fortune, but Œ but so be it, we can™t chan
ge that, but it™s a part of our lives and 
always will be and Œ a
nd as I say, I mean, 
Smitty
, Go d bless him, with his 
comment that whatever happens, every day,
 every day after is a plus. And th  Œ i-
it™s a good thing to rememb er sometimes 
when you get, yo
u know, down or 
depressed or something, it™s Œ it Œ it™s Œ we™re lucky. 
Q: Ho Œ did Œ has your expe
rience, those few minutes in that labor camp assu med 
a mo re prominent part of your memo ries in recent years Œ  
A: A-Ans Œ  
Q: Œ than it did at the time? 

A: Œ answer yes. I-I think the comment made by Œ by
 
Captain
 Greenburg
(ph), we 
touched upon earlier that at th
e time it was just a part of the whole thing. Now, 
having seen  the unfo lding history, and we 
see here is about the Œ th e death camp s 
as well as the slave labor camp, it assume
s a different importance basically, an Œ 
an importance, because it Œ it Œ it Œ it™s a Œ 
war itself is bad, but that Œ that, to 
evidence the cold bloodedness, and the Œ 
and Œ a-a-and th -the deprav ity of what 
this Œ this remarkable nation 
Germany
 Œ I say remarkable, it™s Œ has a Œ of

culture, of art and beau ty and 
[indecipherable]
 all pluses, had sunk to . A-And I 
think probably the Œ th
e Œ the mission of the Œ o-of
 Œ of your institution, the 
Holo caust here, to let it not be forgotten Œ 
if I may add though, I™m interested too, 
I Œ I read an interesting piece by 
Leon Uris
(ph), who would certainly be qualified 
to speak, on the matter Œ on
 the m Œ on the matter of Œ 
of the Holocaust. It was 
following the publicity on 
ﬁSchindler™s List.ﬂ
 And he touched 
upon it, he Œ he 
said that Œ hi-his thought was 
this. He said, it Œ it™s a cri
tical part of our Œ naturally 
of our human, but let it not obsess us. Let it not obsess us because, he said, we Œ 
we become sickened by it a
nd we are limiting ourselves a
nd our capacity if Œ if Œ 
if Œ if we take a narrow view, hm. Int-Inte
resting point. Now ag
ain, it™s difficult to 
judge wh en you™re not in the other person™
s mo ccasins, so to speak and you think 
of all the people, I™m sure that you Œ that
 Œ that Œ that it Œ an interviewer must

 their experiences.  
Q: What is your feeling about 
Germany
 to day ?  
A: Now? Interesting, after the war we ha
d a number of good German friends and 
my  mo th ers say s, wh y in  
the world do you like thes
e darn Germans so much? 
Especially my  Danish background,
 my  Œ cause the Dani Œ all Œ 
Germany
, 
interesting, we do have some good German
 friends. And th ey have a long difficult 
job ahead with the reunification to blen
d it togeth er, but I think it can be an

88
interesting country, and yet 
Œ and yet Œ and yet there ar
e still people that have the 
feeling should they reunite it 
because of in the past what 
Germany
 has done. The 
old saying, forgot who it was, Germans are ei
ther at your feet or at your th roat. I Œ 
I can™t answer Œ generalizations are al
ways a little bit dangerous, I mean, you 
know, you can™t follow it that much, but we™ve been in 
Germany
 a number of 
times, enjoy it, beautiful country,
 good friends. And yet, and yet.
 
Captain 
Greenburg
(ph), ther Œ they™re both
 Jewish and his wife 
Phyllis 
will not go to 
Germany
. Will not go to 
Germany
. For my own part we Œ we Œ as I said, we 
have good friends in 
Germany
, we enjoy having been 
there basically. We™re 
thinking now about maybe this Octobe
r, October ™99 with a good friend from 
home who has lived some length of time in 
Germany
, has good German, of going 
back. I™d like to begin, if 
we go back in October, at the 
Margraten
 cemetery, 
American cemetery where my Œ where 
George Evans 
is buried. Then up into the 
Ruhr 
again to see it an d 
then down into 
Bavaria, Eichstätt, Ingol Œ
 and I don™t 
know, just Œ interesting. We™ll see. We™ll see.  
Q: You said that you Œ you father was 
a lawyer and th at you studied law quite 
soon after you got back. Was any of Œ as
ide from those aspects, do you th ink your 
choice of law was influenced ag Œ also 
by the war experien ce
 and what happens 
when the rule of law gets distorted? 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson  
 
April 6, 1999 
 

 
 
89
A: That-That™s a very idealistic an d appr
opriate thought. I-I don™t think so . I once 
said to Dad, practice law Œ he practiced 
law for Œ he began in 1908 and there until 
he went into court in 1955. I said, Da
d, why did you become a lawyer? Oh, he 
chuckled 
[indeciphera ble]
 said, you know, he said, I 
was in grade school at home 
with a young kid, he used to Œ I™m gonn
a be a lawyer, I™m gonna be a lawyer. He 
said, I got thinking, maybe I should be. A
nd so I did. I said, what happened to  the 
other guy, Dad? He said, I think he became 
a housepainter. But we kind of in th e 
family, Dad, my  uncle in his firm, my  brother was a lawyer and of course, I am 

too. I don™t know, I Œ we just always seem
 to  head that direction, and it™s been a 

very fulfilling th ing. I don™t know, and I Œ 
I Œ I appreciate your comment about the 
Œ the benefit of the rule of law. That™s qu
ite idealistic. I d on™t 
think we think it, but 
we see it, as we get older and have lived
 a lifetime of law, it Œ it™s our discipline 
and of cour Œ there™s no question about th
e Œ the importance of it, because we saw 
in 
Germany
 wh at h a pp en ed  wh en  Œ  w h en  Œ  
when  the Œ when  law vanished. I 
mean, proper law vanished. And it wa Œ it was abused by the Œ by the German 

system, yea h . 

Q: What are your thought
 when  you pick up the ne
wspaper today and you see 
people fleeing from

A: 
[indecipherable]

Q: Œ for instance, and yo
u Œ you, 50 years ago saw 
people on the streets. 
A: Yeah, yeah, it Œ again, I Œ I-I would 
have great compassi
on and Œ and Œ and Œ 
and Œ and sorrow for the Œ the old people
, the young Œ the ch
ildren, for heaven 
sakes, you know. 
Q: Does it bring back memories to you? 

A: I-I thought about it some, yeah, I™ve 
seen them, yeah, yeah. Especially Œ 
especially the Œ the ch ildren. I Œ I cannot 
Œ I do not have the wisd
om to sort out the 
right and wrong of it, I mean I Œ I don™t 
know, I Œ I Œ I Œ I can™t answer that. My 

inclination is Œ is that maybe it has to Œ 
has to happen, but even so , the Œ the side 
effects, and that™s not the correct word really, for a wa
r, the Œ the consequences of 
it to Œ to the un Œ to the peop
le who had Œ were not really
 involved in causing it, i-
is terrible, is terrible.
 We read the book of 
Job.
 Why? Why do these Œ these Œ I Œ I 
have no answer. It™s ju st a part Œ a part of
 Œ a part of the life we lead, apparently 
it™s gonna happen, unfortunately. Until we
 find so me way to conquer all these 
things and get over and get th
 Œ get past them, but not in  our li Œ not in la Œ maybe 
your lifetime, not in mine. No, we™re too 
far Œ we would do all we can to help, but 
I don™t know what we can do. 

Q: Why did you feel the need, when you 
had that 30 day furlough and you came  
back to the 
United States
, why did you feel the need to  write a diary, a log? 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

91
A: It™s a most interesting 
question, yeah. It™s a most, 
most interesting question. I 
don™t know why, unless it was still vivid 
in  my  mind. Looking back, I™m glad I 
had the foresight to do it, 
because t-to look over here
, and touch these old, now 
semi-yello wed pa Œ piece Œ paper, with so
me additions on the end in my almost 
undecipherable hieroglyphics, of each da
y down  the line. I Œ I Œ I don™t know. But 
I can go th rough here and pull things out basically and I™m glad that I did. I d Œ I 
don™t know. Wha Œ why Œ why do
 we do some of the things
 that turn ou
t to be so 
good and other things Œ and overlook th e 
things we don™t? I 
don™t know, tha Œ tha-
that™s interesting, I never thought too mu ch 
about it, but I felt it had to be done. In 

addition to this I have quite a few items 
of memorabilia in a great, big scrapbook 
that I have at home. Clipping from 
papers, a variety 
of postcards from 
Germany
, 
a leaf Œ leaflets that the Americans dr
opped. A variety of things, you know.  
Q: I had a Œ a Œ just a small factual ques
tion to  ask you. I noticed in some of the 
reference books, wh en I looked up the 
Attendorn
 labor camp that 
it said it was in 
the British zone, but this was the American army. 

A: It Œ it probably would be now, becaus
e that was actually
, has beco me the 
British zone, but we took it, you see? I mean, the Œ the Americans to ok it.  
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 

 
Interview with Richard Peterson

92
A: I have to Œ I™ve Œ it would be the Britis
h zone now, that™s right, yeah, because 
that would be the area that 
they Œ that they did take. 
That the a Œ that™s correct, 
that™s correct. 
Q: So they came in after yo
u is what you™re saying? 
A: Yes, because the division a-aft-after th
e complete Œ the complete conquest of 
Germany
, then Œ then came the impact and 
the Œ and the implemen tation of the 
[indecipherable]
 agreement, which made the divisi
on, as I re Œ as I understand it, 
with the Œ and th e Œ 
within the country. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Is there anyt
hing we haven™t touched on Œ 
A: Well, in Œ 
Q: Œ that you would like 
to say Œ talk about? 
A: Œ I Œ I Œ it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s been very, ve
ry, very, very well as
ked, very, very well 
done. I-I think basically that Œ that would 
cover it. I mean, le-let Œ to review – I-I-
I pause because Œ because I™m trying to  Œ to
 th ink base Œ basically of what else 
could be contributed  on the matter of the Œ of the individuals that Œ that were 
released that day. I wonder sometimes what 
their fate was, if they were ru Œ were 
Russian, probably a bad fate. What we read, 
at least about the prisoners of war, the 
Russians, they were 
not accepted back or they were, if
 they were taken back they 
were Œ brutal thing. As far as the civ
ilians, I Œ I Œ I™ve Œ I sometimes wonder what

happened  to  those people, a-again, you kno
w. Didn™t think at the time, but after 
the pass of years you wonder about it, ba
sically. Interestingly also, I did some 
checking out Œ I had occasion to read Œ 
check back in to 
the records of the 
Nuremberg Œ Nuremberg. 
Novemb er, it began. On e of 
the major cases was that 
of a Field Marshal

m-i-n-l Œ m-i-l-c-h, Milch
, who was a subordinate of 
Albert Speer, 
and that was the

. He was one was responsible for 
the Œ the so-called forced labor, alright
? And in the exhibits presented at 
Nuremberg
 in his behalf were requirements by th e 
Reich 
supposedly that these 
people wo uld be adeq uately fed and care
d for. Not humanitarianly-wise, but to 
insure the fact they could 
do th e work  they  were going to
 do, huh. The other was Œ 
simply seemed secondary, basically. Andof course in the case of these poor 

people, in ha Œ admittedly 
now, probably the logistical
 system had broken down, I 
mean as far as food, but that does not s
till explain in a Œ in any way excuse the 
way they were being held. Read, as we have, 
Manchester™s 
book, 
ﬁThe Arms of 
Krupp
,ﬂ
 
and th e Œ and the Œ and th-the treatment to which the 
Kruppianer
 
subjected all their force people, huh. It™s an
 incredible thing, in
credible living in it. 
And Œ and what we saw that afternoon, I 
mean, the way these th
at Œ the way these 
people were. As
 Mac
 said, look what these fuck
ing German Œ terrible.

Q: You are rightfully proud of your Danish
 ancestry. What do you attribute th-the 
difference in their response in the war?  

A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: The Danish people. I said you were ri
ghtfu lly proud of your
 Danish ancestry. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: And we know what the Danes did during the war. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: To wh at do you attribute that to? 
A: The Danish experience? 

Q: The Danish experience, 
as opposed to the German. 
A: Well, it™s quite inters Œ it™s quite in
teresting. Nu mb er one, there had been a 
great Œ a great tradition, history of tolerance in 
Denmark
. Smaller countries 
[indecipherable]
 also. But early enlightenment, which began in 
Denmark 
in the 
1820™s - 30™s, they had Œ 
they had left the mo narchy
, I mean the Œ the actual 
absolute monarchy and into more of a 
constitutional monarchy, th-that helped. A 
smaller country, as I mentioned again, a
nd beyond that, I™m not
 sure, except that 
there was Œ it was indeed a safe haven. Now, as to how the wo nderful escape took 

place in October, several things I Œ I read Œ as we read it. Number one, there had 
been the great feeling of 
the Danish people. The-The-
These are not Danish Jews,

it™s Jewish Danes. A subtle distinction,
 but it™s interesting. Secondly the war 
situation was turning against 
Germany
. Allies were in north
 Africa
 by that time.
 
Stalingrad
 had been co mp leted. The genera
l feeling was Œ was different. The 
proximity Œ the proximity of 
Sweden
 now, made it possible, which might, in a 
landlocked country not have 
happened, huh. And the willingness of the Swed es to 
accept it. There™s a wonderful story told ap ro
pos of that, about the Swedish side of 
it now. When the time came that was realized
 the Germans were going to move, to 
take the Danish Jews, time was sh ort. It
 was a matter of days, but they  had to 
somehow Œ they meaning th e Danish pe
ople under their leadership and the 
resistance g et them out. But they 
had to have the agreement of 
Sweden
 to take 
them. They could not deal with 
Germa ny
 and say Œ because th
at would tip it off. 
So what was determined, from 
what I read, was this, they 
realized that the Danish 
leadership, they had to ge
t the agreement of the Swedish crown. The arrangement 
was made that they, the Danish people wo
uld select, hopefully, that Œ a leader of 
the Danish Jewish comm
unity to hopefully vis
it with the King of 
Sweden
. It was 
arranged. And th e person selected was 
Niels Bohr
, the great atomic 
[indecipherable]
. The story goes on to  say that in Œ in 
Bo hr™s
 wo rds he said Œ he 
said, I™m a scientist, n o t an advocate, he 
said, why Œ well, they
 said you have th-
the standing, the name, the King will Œ 
all right. It was arranged remarkably

. Then, in just a matter of hours they  set this up and apparently 
then, either Œ either by boat Œ they™re 
not Œ they™re Œ they™re Œ they™re still Œ

 Bo hr 
was taken to 
Stockholm, 
to probably 
Drottningholm
 and the palace, 
the story is told. He said, in I went, to 
this massive palace. Re-Realized what was 
on my  sh oulders to try and get this done, 
to persuade the king. I was shown in to 
the room. Had a room and th-th-th-the ki
ng™s attendant was there, basically very 
fine, he said Dr. 
Bo hr
, please wait. Then  he said the mo ment came, he said 
[indecipherable] 
here Œ here Œ here I am ju
st becoming mo re tense by th e 
mo ment. The door opened and th ey said, Dr.
 Bohr
, the king will see you now. He 
said, I step ped in and here was this very
 pleasant looking gentleman, it was the 
king, King
 Gustav
. 
Gu stav Aroff
(ph) I think it was. And he said, I-I have some 
Swed ish. And he said, I explained in 
[indecipherable]
 as best I could the plight of 
our people, what was going to  happen and Œ 
and that we desperately pled fo r help. 
He said, the king, very  cour
teous, stood up. He said, of 
course I stood up too. The 
king walked to thewindow, looked out. He said that Œ I can 
[indecipherable]
 it 
was probably all of ma ybe 10 seconds
, but he came back and said, Dr. 
Bohr,
 your 
people will be welcome in 
Sweden
. And that was it, laid
 the foundation. So, a 
comb ination of things put together, you se
e, and of course th

mean there were Œ there were some prob
lems to getting them Œ getting the Danes 
across or getting the Œ the Œ the Jews acro
ss,  the Jewish people. Some Œ some boat 
people did charge, others 
did not, back and forth, but it still was a remarkable, 
remarkable thing, 
huh? Incredible. 
Q: Anything else before 
we close, any message?  
A: I Œ I Œ I Œ 

Q: Any message to your grandchildren? 
A: Beg your pardon? 
Q: Any message to your grandchildren? 

A: Keep the faith. No, oh I Œ I Œ no, th-t
he Œ th e kids are doing fine. And I have 
one of my  Œ my  good Jewish 
friend who i-i-is very Œ is 
very much invo
lved in his 
persuasion, which is fine. Bu
t he often repeats the fact, 
he says, how fortunate we 
are a-a-as Jews to live in th
is country, this is Œ to be a part of this great country . 
That™s very true for all of 
us. Apologize, I didn™t mean to get all Œ but Œ but it™s Œ 
it™s a Œ you know, I come to 
Washington,

country and Œ and Œ 
and I still Œ don™t we all Œ get a look,

put on our packs, grab up our

will move off, my Œ
