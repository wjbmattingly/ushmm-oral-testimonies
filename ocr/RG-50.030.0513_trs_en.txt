was very smart woma n, down to 
earth. She was a mother with a full heart. Some time  -- when my brother was born two years 

later, he was born in December 14, 19 fi -- ™36, two years later, and I was jealous of the attention. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So -- a -- we lived in one room in Warsaw, 
a big room with a kitchen stove and this. When 
my mo m wa s cooking dinner, all of a sudden she 
hear a baby crying. And I was nowhere to be 
found. So she said, [speaks Yiddish
] in Yiddish, what happened?  I 
didn™t say anything, then I 
came out very much ashame d, and I say, ﬁI scratc
hed my brother, I don™t want him.ﬂ My mo m 
say, ﬁWhy?  He is your brother, you have to love 
him.ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t want him,ﬂ so I scratch a 
little bit his eye, and with some thing -- there 
was some thing, a fork or some thing, I don™t know, I 
took from the kitchen, from my mo
m™s and I did it. I was very mi sc
hievous and -- but later I love 
my brother, we were unseparable. And during th
e war, everything, we worked together. He was 
very handsome. He had curly, beau
tiful brown hair like a cherub. 
Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513

A: A full face, like -- like a bubele. I loved him 
ve ry much like a -- a doll, you know, when he 
was little. And he ate good, and -- but always looked 
up to me to take him, to go with him, so I 
took care. And my mo m was happy. We had a lot 
of fa mily living in the same  corridor in 
Warsaw. Different apartments, but my Buba Chana,
 t h at  w a s  my  mo m - -  my  fa t h e r ™s  mo m,  s h e  
was little, she was wearing a shei
tel, a wig, you know, because in 
those days they were very 
religious. And Chanaleh, Buba Chanaleh was little and she was widowed when very young, and 

the kids were little. She had siv -- seven kids, 
six boys, and a daughter Reisl. Beautiful, she was a 
seamstress with very curly hair, 
and she loved when I touched her 
hair and I did like with the 
hands, I did her curls up, brown hair. And she 
was singing and dancing, she had four children, 
ma rried, her husband was Herman. And they all lived one next to another, the same  corridor, 

different apartments in Warsaw. 

Q: And -- and -- and you were a kind of 
favorite child amongst all these?  You -- 
A: I was very outgoing always. I liked to sing, I like
d to dance with them, and they -- and I used 
to come  -- I™m very friendly with everybody, childre
n or adults, and young or old. So I used to be 
there always, eating together, pl
aying together with the children. And I didn™t feel anything 
special, they were also. And there was an-another -- there was another younger brother, my 

father™s brother that his name  was Schloime , 
and he ma rried a nice woman and they had one 
daughter, Sabina, very chubby, very beautiful 
girl, younger than me , and we were playing 
together, we were hide and seek from one ap
artment to another, running, you know, everything 
was open like one big family. 

Q: So you were very free as a young girl -- 

A: Free, very free.

A: Yeah, yeah. And then the wate
r was never in the house, we don™
t have water, running water in 
the house, it was in a corridor farther up, some ti
mes there was no water supply, so we went with 
my mo m, there was, not far from our house were
 Pawia Street, and -- and we live on Pa wia 82, it 
was not far so we took two buckles, I had a sm
all pail, and brought wate

was nice and good. I have -- I had c
ousins also. My father™s older 
brother, Yukel, he almost 
survived the war. He had two children, Luba, my
 cousin Luba and Mord
echai. All the males 
from my father™s side, because he -- his father
 died young, and his name  was Mordechai, so all 
the -- all those male and each of the br
others was name d Mor dechai Szlinger. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Hm. 

A: So I have a Mordechai Szlinger in Kibbutz Dafna 
in Israel. He is older than me . And they run

in Russia and my Uncle 
Yukel died in Poland 
comi ng back from Russ ia. 

Q: After the war. 

A: After the war. And we came a mo nth later and we didn™t find him alive any more. 

Q: I see, uh-huh. 

A: He died before we came . But he is buried in
 Wr oclaw and I visited on the Jewish cemetery, I 
visited the grave of my Uncle Yukel. His wife Ge
itel died in Russia. She was a very sick person 
before, and she died. So, when the war started -- 

Q: Can -- can -- can we go back a little bit? 

A: Yeah.

A: I was a tomboy, and everything had to be my wa
y. We play games, I ha -- I always disagreed 
with them. I say no, it has to be this, but not -- 
the children didn™t want th
at. So I did something, 
you know?  Like I did -- my scratch my
 father™s -- my brother™s eye, 
and things like that. I didn™t 
want to have a brother, I told my mo m. So 
-- but she always was explaining, she never yelled. 
My mo m died in ™97. 
Q: Really? 

A: She was 97 years old. 

Q: Oh my. 

A: I was my  mo m™ s favorite, and I -- my mo mwa s my best friend. I could tell my mother 

everything and anything, she understood, and I mi
ss her very much. When I moved to America 
and she was in Israel, always sent tickets for 
her to come . She was three time s in New York 
visiting us for months, and we took -- and she 
was very excited, we t
ook her to Niagara Falls, 
and [Ms. Zelazny quotes her mother, speaking in 
Yiddish.], she say, ﬁIs th
is true?  I™m here, I™m 
here? ﬂ  I say, ﬁYes Mom,  here is
 the [i ndecipherable], this is Ne
w York, the big buildings.ﬂ [Ms. 
Zelazny quotes her mother, speaking in Yiddish.] Sh
e never saw them -- this 
is so beautiful. I am 
so happy to be -- and I tooked he
r to museums. She -- she was ve
ry -- she didn™t study, they 
didn™t have the right, Jews, to study a lot. Two, 
three grades. She knew to read and write Yiddish 
and Polish. My grandfather, her father, Todres
 Weinstein came  from Ki ev. He was a young ma n, 
came to -- you know, to peddle, he wa s a peddler. 
He was selling shoelaces, [indecipherable] 
ma terial for -- for sewing. And he knew Russia
n, Yiddish, and then he learned Polish, and he 
was a very, very interesting ma n, and he taught
my mo m. My mo m was 
talented, there were 
ma ny sisters and brothers on my mother™s side
, there was seven. My grandfather me t this young 
woma n with a child on the ca -- ma rket. And he
 was selling ribbons and all kind of things,

accessories. And she came, and he looked at her and he said, buy this, buy that. So she say, ﬁI 
don™t have enough money, I™ll come  another day.ﬂ He 
said, no, ﬁI™ll give you this and then when 
you come another time, you pay me.ﬂ And he as
k a question, ﬁWhere™s your husband?ﬂ Think 
she say, I™m a widow with a child. Her son™s name
 was Natan, Nute in Yiddish. And they fe ll in 
love. He was a bachelor and he ma rried her, and 
he raised his chi -- my -- my Uncle Nute was a 
big ma n, tall. And the Polish people were very
 prejudiced against Jews, and if some thing 
happened, they say oh, dirty Jew, in Polish, or they 
beat up, or they bothered the girls, the Jewish 
girls. So my Uncle Nute beat them all up. And when he was comi ng, they yelled, Natan is 

comi ng, Nat a n is comi ng, so they knew to run away. 

Q: Right. 

A: He was like a fighter, he pr
otected every girl, everybody. Was ta
ll, I reme mber him. And then 
they have seven more children, my buba alte. They
 call her alte, in Yiddish alte is too old. Why 
they gave the name , I ask. Alte m
eans old, and she should grow old -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: To live and grow old. I don™t know the name s  
why they gave, but this was this. And they 
lived in a different suburb in Praga. Poland had 
-- Warsaw had a few suburbs. We  lived in the 
Warsaw area and they lived in Praga, be -- a li
ttle bit fart her by tramway 
or bu -- to go. So they 
visited once in awhile, and I reme mb er Zaide To
dres, he was the only zaide I had, grandparent -- 
grandfather, because the other one died young, my 
father™s side. So I had two bubas, granddau -- 

ba -- mothers, they were wonderful, the fa mily 
was wonderful and we we
re all living together, 
and happy. And Chanukah or other holidays, Jewish
 holidays, they gave us a lot of gifts and 
sweets, and we were happy.

Q: We re you -- bef -- by the time  you were five
 years old, we re you very conscious of yourself 
as a Jewish child? 
A: No. 

Q: You were not. 

A: No. 

Q: So there™s -- 

A: There was no difference, we never discuss th
at we are different, or whatever. They spoke 
Polish, we spoke Jewish, but I was home .I never went to a kindergarten there. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because they decided we don™t have money, t hey
 poor people, they rais
e the childr en in the 
house, and there was a buba to -- to look after 
us, and there was an uncle [indecipherable] who 
lived together in the same 
area, so I never went then. 
Q: And it was there that people became much mo
re conscious of the religious differences? 
A: Yeah, when I became conscious, when Ger many invaded Poland, and they bombe d Wa rsaw. 

Q: Do you reme mber that time ?  

A: Yes. 

Q: What -- what -- what do you remember as a

boots, they had the high --

11 
 
 
Q: Boots. 
A: -- leather boots, and holding the dog next t
o. And we -- when Wa rsaw was bombed, we didn™t 
have electricity, didn™t have wate
r in the apar tment. So we were 
going -- first of all, my father 
was very active in a Jewish Bund. 
they call it, the organization, that
 he was always being arrested 
before the first of May or  whatever, because they
 ma de riots. It was very political orga nization, 
used to wear a Jewish uniform.
 And he knew what™s going to 
happen, and said to the family, 
ﬁWe have to leave Wa rsaw, we have to go away, they™re going to kill all Je ws, because Germans 

kill -- Germans do all that atro
city, I see and we know it.ﬂ But nobody was expecting anything. 
My grandmother Chana and the other brother sa
ys to my father, du me shugener, Moishe. ﬁYou 
crazy. Why you going away, why you want to r
un away?ﬂ He says, ﬁI have to.ﬂ So my 
grandmother says, ﬁBut we have the war before
,ﬂ 1914, the far -- first war, World Wa r, ﬁnothing 
happened, they da -- we were hungry, we di
dn™t have food, but nothing happened to us, nobody 
killed us. Just people who were on the front, in 
the line, they were kill
ed sometime, but nothing 
will happen to us, why to run away?ﬂ He said, 
ﬁI am going away. I take my wife and the 
children. Who wants to come  with me ?  I™m goi
ng to hire a buggy with a horse, and we™ll run 
away from Warsaw.ﬂ Nobody listened.  

Q: Did you hear these conversations, Sarah? 

A: What? 

Q: Did you hear these conversa -- 

A: Yeah -- 

Q: You did. 

A: -- they talking -- 

Q: They talking in front of you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
12 
 
 
A: They were talking in fr ont of me , a nd I wa
s asking later questions 
when I understood more, 
why, and this and my father came -- well, first I 
want to tell you how I got
 encountered with the 
German, with the atrocity. 
Q: Mm. 

A: Since there was no water in the house, we ha
d to go with pails and get water on the ceme tery, 
not far, they call it Powanski, the cemetery in 
Warsaw. So we have to get water, there was a 
pump, and water running. So people stood on line a
nd got water in pails. 
So I had a little pail 
also I was carrying and my mother had two. We  
brought water, whatever we could we gave to 
the buba, to everybody. They also went to get water.
 So what I seen, young German s oldiers with 
the dogs, with the shepherds, with
 the big stick wi  -- you know, lik
e a big pole and a rubber, very 
heavy rubber. They put a Jewish ma n that was 
walking, with a beard, you 
can see it™s a Chassidic 
Jew. They grabbed him, and the Germans said 
[s peaks foreign language here] you dirty Jew. And 
took a knife out from his  boot, and cut it with --
 not just the beard, w
ith the -- it was running 
blood, he touch his flesh, and pushed him aside, he
 fell. So ma ny things that they stepped with 
the dogs, you know, like very vicious. And my fa
ther saw that, and I was crying and my mo m 
said, Surele -- I was holding her dress because sh
e -- her ha nds were busy w
ith the two pi -- pails 
of water, I was holding her dress, and she said to
 me  in Yiddish Surele [speaks Yiddish here], 
close your eyes, my child. Surele she called me  a
ll the time, and I loved that name. And she said, 

Surele [Yiddish], don™t look. Pleas
e let™s go fast home . And I sa
w that horses lying, electric 
poles, because they bombed Wa rsaw. So whatev
er there was bombing, houses destroyed, sa -- 
the streets, there was a chaos. People didn™t know where to go, what to do. So one evening my 

father decided to bring a carriage with a horse, 
and he said to my mo m 
[speaks Yiddish], take 
whatever you can, but not [indecipherable]. Th
ey sew in, because they
 had nice jewelry, nice 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
13 
 
 
clothe -- my father was dressed very
 elegant, in suit. I used to shine his shoes, it has to be like a 
mi rror. In Poland still as a big 
girl I did that. He taught me . 
Q: He taught you to do that. 
A: He was so pedantic, so me ticulous. 

Q: But you were not a wealthy family. 

A: No. 

Q: But -- but ther e were some things that -- 

A: Some  things that -- yeah. My mother had 
a few rings, a wedding band, and a few rings, my 
father too. They sew it into the clothing, you know?  
They had dresses, a coat in winter. It was 
September, Nove mber already, it was cold and rain
ing, so we gathered all the warm clothes. My 
mom had a few s mall suitcases with food for us. So
 my fa -- my si -- brother was dressed very 

nice, he had a -- a gray coat, a small, with a l
ittle heart, you know, you g 
-- pull it, close it here. 
He was so cute. And shoes, and they put us 
-- everybody cried, and nobody wanted to come  with 
us. 

Q: We re you frightened? 

A: Yes. I cried, too, and my mo m held my eyes 
so that I should not see. It was nighttime and 
they were running and the city of Wa rsaw wa
s burning. And people running and noises all over. 
I never forget that. And I ask a question once, 
my mo m and dad -- we spoke mostly Yiddish at 
home -- 

Q: Yes [indecipherable] 

A: -- but we knew Polish, too. I say [s peaks fore
ign language here], ﬁWhy is this happening?  
Why?ﬂ So my father say, ﬁBecause we are Jews. B
ecause Germans hate us, they want to destroy 
us.ﬂ I said, ﬁBut why?  What did we do diffe
rent. We are living here

 in apar tments and th
ere was like a hallway. 
Q: Right.  

A: And in the hallway there was pump with water.
 So it was not running wa ter in your kitchen or 
[indecipherable] we have to carry the water in pails, bring it to the apartment to kitchen, and use 

it. Or washing whatever you have to
 wash -- we didn™t have showers. 
Q: Right. 

A: Not even a bathroom in the room, we had to go outdoors. 

Q: You have to go outdoors for the bathroom. 
A: Yes, yes. And a -- a funny story. 
Q: Yeah?   

A: The bathroom thing that they used, my grandm
other Chana used to take a pail of all the dirty 
stuff, that we peed, or other things and throw 
it out at night some where 
on a corner that doesn™t 
touch nobody or will not smell some in the mi ddle of
 the street. So I -- she was very superstition. 

So, she took me  with her some ti me  and some ti me
 my mom. I  didn™t under
stand then, but I will 
tell you what she did. They were so superstitious 
then that they believed that dead bodies, dead 
people walk at night around us, but we don™t see them
. So she used to say, before she spilled that 
dirt, she used to say, ﬁScheidem, scheidem,ﬂ -- 
scheidem is like dead bodies, ﬁScheidem, gay 
avek, gay avek.ﬂ

Q: Go away. 
A: Go away. We  have things to do, go away, don™t 
stay in front of us. On all four sides. East, 
west, south, no-north, wherever. Four sides 
she turned, and she say the same  thing -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- scheidem, scheidem [indeci
pherable], please excuse me , go away. And then, after she went 
to all the four sides, she did the business, she 
threw it away. And I was st
anding, and I was really 
afraid. I didn™t know exactly what scheidem is, 
but she explained like dead bodies and this. I 
didn™t associate with d-dead bodies then, I di
dn™t see too ma ny. So I couldn™t understand, but 

when I got older, I know the superstitious, you 
know, people had in the old days, everybody is 
superstitious. So I understood the way they treated th
e dead bodies with respect, that they mi ght 
be hurt by her. This is a very funny thing. 

Q: Right. 

A: There are ma ny things. I used to -- my Aunt 
Reisl, which is like a -- a rose, yeah? She was the 
only sister of six brothers. She was beautiful
, she was a seamstress with her husband also, 
Herman.  

Q: This is the sister of your father? 

A: Of my fa ther. They had four children. Two 
o f  t h e  n a me s  I  r e me mb e r
. One, the name  -- the 
first born by everybody in the family Szlinger wa
s Mordechai, Mijatek. Okay, in Polish, Mijatek. 
Like a translation from Yiddish Mordechai. And 
the baby girl was Bronia, Bronka they call. And 
the two others, younger, I don™t reme mber. They 
were all redheads. We  were a family of 
redheads and I had a lot of
 fr eckles. I still have -- that hair, 
it™s colored, I™m not red originally, I 
have gray, and then my hair become  very dark, afte
r they were cutting my  hair in Russia a lot, so 
it became s black, really changed the color. But 
it was a very happy fa mily. They were not rich, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
18 
 
 
but happy together and singing and dancing, all the 
movies they saw they were singing the songs. 
That™s what I talked about Molitik -- a
nd how do I know Molly Pickens? From the m. 
Q: Right. 
A: And then I saw her movies. I saw her 
in Yentl in ﬁFiddler on the Roof.ﬂ 
Q: You did, yes, in New York? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: When -- when you -- you and your brother and your
 mother and father get on this horse and 
buggy, yes?  And there™s no other 
family me mbers, those -- 
A: They didn™t want to. 

Q: They wou -- they wouldn™t go. 

A: No. My father came at night, 
and he prepared us before, told
 my mom to do some gathering 
things, clothing, food for the children, everything.
 It was fall, Nove mber was already cold and 
raining. And he asks the brothers and the sist
ers, also he can get 
some  horses and buggies, 
renting for money, and run away. So my grandmothe
r Chanaleh -- Chana and others say that my 
bro -- my father™s a me shugener, a crazy. Wh
ere you taking young children in such a cold 
bitterness, you running away, why?
 He says, ﬁIt™s going to be wo
rse. Germany is going to kill 
every Jew, and they going to ma ke camps.ﬂ So my buba Chana say, ﬁYou crazy. Before, in the 

14™s, there was a war, nothing happened, we we
re only hungry. But nothing happened to Jews.ﬂ 
So he said, ﬁWho wants to come  with us?ﬂ He 
has a premonition or he knew some thing from the 
organization what™s going on -- to happen. And seei
ng dead body in the streets, and dead horses, 
and German running with German Shepherds,
 and beating every old ma n or young ma n, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
19 
 
 
taking Jewish beards and cut them with blood ru
nning. He saw that it™s not good, so he brought 
that at night, the horse, and 
my mo m was ready. We did not 
understand anything 
then, I didn™t 
know what™s going on. I cried, my brother crie
d, we were -- you know, hushed up by my mo m, 
my father, and we left. We left 
Wa rsaw burning, Wa rsaw was burning. 
Q: Do you re -- 

A: I reme mb er the fire. 

Q: You do? 

A: Like, do you see, ﬁGone With 
the Wi ndﬂ, the burning of Atlanta? 
Q: Mm-hm, yeah. 

A: That™s how -- 

Q: That™s how it looked? 

A: -- I remember that, too. 

Q: And the smell. 
A: And the smell and everything and the danger.
 And the sme ll of dead bodies, and Germans 
standing all this, and Polacks st
anding, you know, they think that 
never happen to them, and they 
were happy, smiling, they showing like this. Li ke
 they going to be slaughtered like this, you 
know?  They were happy. 
Q: Did you see -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- Polish gentiles doing that -- 

A: Yeah, yes. Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: -- around the neck?  Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
20 
 
 
A: Yes. So, at night we didn™t know where 
we running. We ™re running and running a few days. 
We went -- my father told my mom in Jewish
 that we™re going to a border between Poland and 
Russia. There™s ma ny borders. We  went to a pl ace 
called Zaremby-Kosci e lne. It™s a Polish -- it™s 

a -- Koscielne means churches, a pl ace of church
es. There were probably a lot of churches in 
that, that™s why it™s called Zare
mby-Koscielne in Polish. Kosciel is me  -- is Polish, a church. So 
we went to Zaremby-Koscielne. It was raining, 
cold. We  ha d some  clothes, some  this, but it was 
wet, we were soaked wet. They -- the horse
 and buggy -- the buggy wa -- the carriage was open, 
we didn™t have any cover, only a -- the blankets wh
ich were soaked already, and we came  to that 
place. It was woods and a big fi
eld, raining, dark and -- and gr a
y, very bi tter cold, and we 
stopped there. The German -- that
 was a border between Russia a
nd Polish. I don™t know exactly 
the geography, but it™s -- was some where in the s
outh, it™s -- was -- bete -- we were supposed to 
go to Bialystok. It was Russian border th
en, now Bialystok is back Polish.  
Q: Right. 
A: Bialystok means a white mountain, Bialyst
ok. And we stood in Zaremby-Koscielne, Germans 
were around us with dogs, of c
ourse, and from the trees, the pine trees, my father made like a 
chalash, like the Indi an live in this. But the rain 
pe netrated anywhere, so we were wet there, the 
bedding that they brought, everything was soaked, 
we were cold, my feet were frozen, and my 
brother cried, my brother cried, he wa s always
 hungry. He was a baby, he didn™t understand. One 
day they took everybody out on the field, like 
gathering together. My 
father was holding my 
brother on his ha -- in his hand. I was holding my
 mother™s hand, nothing else, and the Germans 
came like making an ins-inspection. 
Who this and this and my brot
her cried, Mordechai cried, so 
my father held him like this and said, shh. So 
the German ca me over with this stick, the rubber 
stick, slashed my father™s face with it, and 
with such a rage. I don™t know why, there was no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
21 
 
 
reason. He just beat him with that and cr -- a
nd here was open and blood was running his -- over 
the -- his face, so my -- we all cried. I cried, my
 mom cried and my brothe
r cried very much. So 
the German, zai schtul, ma s schtul, be quite. An
d we stopped. So the German ca me , one German 
had a piece of salami  like the [indecipherabl
e] thing, he gave it to my brother. 
Q: Gave him a piece, or  gave him th
e whole thing? A -- a little pi ece. 
A: Like -- like this length, yeah -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- a narrow piece of good wurst, salami . And my fa
ther took and shared with all four of us, we 
ate. And he says to him, you have very nice ch
ildren, but don™t stay here. That means he was 
huma n. He had to do his job, the German, but he to
ld us, my father especially not to be here, 
because Germany is taking young men to the country 
and they started already, they prepared for 
concentration camps. We didn™t kno
w that then, but now, after th
is, you know the history, they 
prepared that in Poland, the rail
roads and the barracks, they we re
 built before the concentration -- 
years before, they prepared. And I don™t understand one
 thing. Did they not realize what is it for?  
Nobody spoke about it, nobody knew about it?  That™s
 a puzzle to me , because it was done 
before, years before. All the barracks, all the rail
roads to go from all -- it was a big, big project to 
do, from all over Europe to bring trains to
 this place. To Treblinka, to Auschwitz. 
Q: You think they ma de new tracks? Uh-huh. 

A: They prepared long time  be fore they starte
d to do it. And I think th
e Polish governme nt knew 
too, but it was not a Communist governme nt there, it was other. So, when -- 

Q: So he warned your father to go away. 

A: -- when -- when the German gave us 
salami  and everything, where everybody was happy, 

they say go to your places, my father said tomy mom -- I knew later, I didn™t know as a child 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
22 
 
 
what happened, that you stay with the children, try 
to break the border. Go
 to Russia, and I am 
running to Bi alystok and I will wait for you in 
the synagogue. There was a big Jewish synagogue 
in Bialystok. And over there we will meet
. I don™t know when we will come . My father 
disappeared the next day. We  
didn™t know anything, we cried. 
My mo m s a id, shh to me . My 
brother didn™t understand, he was little. But she 
told me , ﬁSurele, don™t cry. Your father will 
come . We will meet with Father. Just  be good gi rl.ﬂ  We  didn™t have food, but the German didn™t 
bother then so much, so my mo m we nt -- she le
ft us alone with some  other older people to 
watch, and she went to work. There were a lot of Jewish Polish families living there in Zaremby-

Koscielne, and she went to look for work, what
ever. She could cook, she could clean, she could 
do anything, watch childr en, and she found a little 
job by very rich family that they came from 
Russia pal -- they -- they se
nd them to this place like, you know, a punishme nt, some t hing, the 
Communists or whatever. And she cleaned there,
 she cooked and she brought some  food for us, 
whatever leftover, potatoes, a l
ittle bit chicken, whatever, brea
d. We  were happy to have that. 
Q: Where are you stay
ing?  Are you outside? 
A: On the field. 

Q: On the field, are there other -- 

A: On the field as a -- for long. 

Q: -- refugees there? 

A: Refugee -- like a refugee plac
e. It was not wired, nothing. It wa
s [indecipherable] from all the 
sides surrounded. It was like a fi
eld, open field between woods.  
Q: And you™re outside, you have no shelter? 

A: No, nothing. 

Q: Nothing.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
23 
 
 
A: Nothing, that -- the pine trees my father 
cut that they put toge
ther like in a V -- 
Q: In the V. 
A: That was all. 

Q: That was all. 

A: Everything. When was nice weather my moth
er took out the -- the 
goosefeathers, you know, 
the blanket from goosefe a ther, very heavy. Th
ey call it a perine in
 Yiddish. It™s like a 
goosefeather blanket, ve ry heavy. I still ha ve
 one. It™s good for the wint er, it™s light . 
Q: And wha t  did she do, put 
it outside so it would dry? 
A: To dry, yeah, and then to cover us at night th
at we don™t feel cold. My feet were swollen from 
cold, I couldn™t walk. My toes, still today when it™s bad weather -- 

Q: You feel it. 

A: -- I have my big toes swollen 
bigger, and they itch. Before, I had blisters, it was swollen from 
the cold and I had blisters, I couldn™t even walk. 
But there was no me dication to -- to heal it, just 
time did it, but I still feel when
 it™s very cold I feel they bo
ther me  like needles comi ng through, 
and -- and psychological -- psychologically I will always reme mber this thing what happened, 

because it was a tremendous impact on my lif
e as a child, to go through this and not 
understanding why. Now I know why. I know the 
politics, I know what happened, now I know 

why. But then, what the German did to children 
and later on with the camp
s, that was terrible 
what they did. That was the worst part. These were intelligent, educated people. Germany was a 

very advanced -- with everyt
hing, technologically, a
nd a -- and how could a nation do that to 
every people in the world, and not just Jews
, to Russian, [indecipherable] and Gypsies. 
Q: How do you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
24 
 
 
A: Exterminating millions and millions and th
e whole world stood stil
l. Why?  Nobody cared. 
Nobody said anything. So when we tried to smuggl
e the border, my mother
 tried every evening 
to -- there were the booths, and there was a Po
lish soldier on this side
, Russian soldier -- you 
know, they like -- on the border they
 had a booth, yes, one Polish 
flag and one side the Russian 
flag, and soldiers in their uniforms. The Russian
s stood with the rifles, an
d the Polish with the 
rifles. So my mother took us every day, some ti
me in the evening, some time in the afternoon, but 
not at dark, and she spoke Russian and she spok
e Polish to the other. I reme mber the Russian 
soldier got upset, he took the rifle and say in
 Russian, ﬁDavai na zad.ﬂ Go back. My mother 
didn™t want to move back, and she started to beg 
and cry. He pushed her with the carabine -- with 
the rifle, with the other side, with the wooden si
de, pushed her in here and my mother fell, and 
she didn't move. And we thought my -- the mother 
is dead. Me and my br other started to cry. 
Momma, M o mma, we s poke Polish. Momma stin
e, Momma styoff in Yiddish. Get up, get up 
Momma. You not dead, you not dead. And the -- my
 mother was like fainted or whatever, she 
didn™t move. So the soldier came over, the Russia
n, yelling at us, davai 
na zad, but we didn™t 
know what davai na zad is. Go back, go back. 
But s -- I cry, I say Momma , Momma. And they 
spoke Polish on the border, the Russian spoke Polish. I said to him in Polish, ﬁMy mo m is dead?  

My mo m is not living? ﬂ So he say, ﬁYour mo m i s
 going to be fine.ﬂ He went down, I don™t know 
what he said to her. She later told me . When she 
came to herself, sh -- he picked her up, he -- her 
-- she was all in mud, it was muddy, rainy, and we  
went back to our place. And she tried again. 
With the Polish soldier nothing, th
ey -- they were very rude, th
ey couldn™t do it. One day -- she 
kept separ -- now I understand she kept secrets fro
m me or brother -- my brother was little. She 
couldn™t tell me . And she said one 
day to me , ﬁSurele, ga ther ever
ything what we have the little 
bundles, put everything together a
nd we go for a walk in the even
ing.ﬂ It was a nice evening, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
25 
 
 
was not raining and it wasn™t cold, it was dr
y. And we walked. I was holding my mo m by the 
skirt because she was holding my brother, he
 couldn™t walk too much. And Mordechai, my 
brother, the chubby guy, always
 was hungry, alwa ys. He liked food and was hungry. He was 
crying because he was hungry. And wh
enever I had a piece of bread 
she gave us the same  ration, 
I cut a pi ece for him later. I knew he will cr y, so 
I gave him my share. One evening we went to 
the woods, didn™t tell us anythi
ng. She say we going here, ma ybe we™ll find some thing to eat, 
some  grass growing or mushrooms, you know, wild
 mushrooms, wild grass, and we™ll find. And 
it was dark, it was twilight, you know
, it wasn™t light any mo re. But 
we could still see, and we 
were walking along the line and there was a 
wire, you know, there were -- it was wired, the 
whole thing. And all of a sudden 
my mom says, ﬁSit here, let™s sit 
here.ﬂ We sat on the grass, my 
mother went to the wire to the gate, and undern
eath she pushed it up, there was like a hole. Later 
I find out that the soldier, when 
he beat her and she was laying like that, he told her, at night you 
go here, and there is a open wire. And you go to th
e woods. And he told her what to expect. She 
didn™t say anything to us, nothing, 
we were too little, and we coul
d tell. So what happened?  She 
digged a little bit, she pushed my brother undern
eath, fine, she pushed me
, and then she ma de a 
little higher, I was holding up the wire
 a little bit, lifted it as much
 as I could for five years old. 
Q: Right. 

A: So we went through, and we ha
d a little thing,
 my mother was holding my brother, I was her 
skirt, because she needed two hands, always with
 her skirt, she was wearing a long skirt, warm. 

And we™re walking, and it™s dark and I used to hear
 stories about wolves and -- and wild animals, 
that they going to eat us up, and my mom sai
d, ﬁDon™t worry, nobody is going to eat us, there™s 
nobody, it™s too cold.ﬂ All of a sudden -- we walk, 
we walk maybe an hour or more, I see some  
light. I had very good vision, I see 
some  light far away like a litt
le light. I said, Mama , Mama  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
26 
 
 
[speaks Yiddish] in Yiddish, I said to her, ﬁLook
, there™s some  light.ﬂ She says, ﬁShh, don™t say.ﬂ 
She knew where we going. We  ca me closer, there™
s a little wooden shack, like, and lights. We  
came in, we knocked into the door, a older woma n opened the door. And there was a ma n -- I 
feel chills when I tell that, because  I reme mber th
at stor y well. And the woma n said to her, to my 
mother, in Polish, ﬁWho are you? ﬂ  Kto ty jest?  
So my mo m says, ﬁI™m running from Warsaw, 
the Germans killed my f -- husband, he is not alive.
 I have two sick children, please help me .ﬂ So 
she say, ﬁCome in.ﬂ Inside there was that wo
ma n, an older ma n, probably her husband and a 

young woman, ma ybe the daughter. They
 gave us food, they washed us, and they put us on the h-
hay, there was hay on the floor. And she give us c
overs to cover ourself 
for night, and she says, 
in Polish she said to my mom, ﬁDon™ t say anyt
hing who let you through. This is the border 
between this -- we live here ma ny years, we spea
k Polish and Russian. This is our home , but this 
is the border between Poland and Russia.ﬂ 

Q: We  need -- we need to change the tape, so 
we™ll continue this stor

Q: Okay. Sarah, you were in this little house? 
A: Hut, hut. 

Q: Hut, it was really a hut. 

A: It™s a wooden hut. 

Q: And -- and they put you on hay, and gave you some  blankets. 

A: Yeah. That was th -- 

Q: And is your mother laying there as well? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: The three of you were laying there? 

A: The three. We  were not -- never separated. I 
clinged to my  mother, my
 mother took care of 
the brother, the little baby boy. 

Q: Boy. 
A: And because he always cried, he  was not lik
e I. I don™t understand myself how I was patient 
at this age of five, five and some thing, that I 
never cried and I never as
k for anything, I always 
held my mot her™s skirt. Be -- I -- I was afraid 
to be separated because people used to run and 
losing one another and yelling 
and not finding one another. Th
at was terrible show. But I 
reme mber. So we slept, they ga
ve us food in that little shack. 
Q: So they were nice to you? 
A: Yes. And they gave us  dry clot hes, you know, 
like a bi g rubashka, she will ask what it is, like 
a nightgown -- 

Q: Uh-huh.

28 
 
 
A: -- but ma de of cotton, rough cotton, you know
, with long sleeve and long -- it was too long 
for me , for my age, but I kept warm. I was so warm, it was so good and dry, you know? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And she dried our clothes, a
nd the next day she said to my
 mom -- my mother™s name was 
Perele in Yiddish, but the Ru
ssian call her Perla.
 Perla like a -- a -- a d -- no, Pearl. 
Q: Right. 

A: A pearl. 

Q: Right. 

A: So she said to my mo m, ﬁPerla, you can not 
stay here. This is a border gathering. The Russian 
sold -- soldiers come here to warm up, to drink 
some thing, to eat, and they
 leave. In the morning 
you will have to leave.ﬂ So my mo m cried, she 
said, ﬁWhere would I go with the little sick 
children?  My child™s legs are frozen, Sarah™s legs
.ﬂ So she say -- she gave me  some  bandages to 
cover the wounds and she gave us food and my
 mom took out her wedding band and gave it to 
them because we didn™t have money to pay. She di
dn™t want  to tell -- take it, as -- and Momma 
says, ﬁTake it. Maybe one days you will help some
body also. You need that.ﬂ In the morning we 
were sleeping very comf ortable then all of 
a sudden we woke up to light. There was like a 
flashlight  comi ng down [indecipherable] on the floor, flashlight came to our face. I opened my 

eyes and got scared. And my mo m say vynish, vy
nish, don™t cry. And the Russian ask my mo m, 
ﬁYou a Russian?ﬂ Because her father came from Ki
ev, he taught her Russian, Yiddish, write and 
speak. My grandfather Todres from Kiev, he wa
s an educated ma n. And she spoke to them in 
Russian, they spoke Russian and he ask her [ind
ecipherable] and I remember he ask where are 
you from, why are you running, where is your husban

German killed him.ﬂ And I looked, I -- I di dn™t 
sa y a word. And he ask me  [speaks Russian

29 
 
 
here], in Russian. ﬁGirl, come  here, come  here, 
we™ll give you some  candies,ﬂ and this, and one 
of the soldier took me  and he hugged me . He say th
at I have nice long hair, 
curly hair. I™m a nice 
looking girl, and my brother, he
 was holding us, gave us some
thing to eat. And he say in 
Russian, ﬁWhere is your father? ﬂ
 I said, ﬁI don™t know 
my father.ﬂ I started to cry, ﬁI don™t 
know, the German took him.ﬂ So he says, ﬁOkay.
 We  ca me  with the wagon, with the horse and 
we™re going to tel -- take you to the border. Whatev
er you have, gather. In a half an hour we™re 
going to take you away from here. You cannot stayhere.ﬂ So the woma n, that Polish woma n told 
Mom in Polish that -- don™t be af
raid, these Russian soldiers th
ey don™t wa nt any spies in the 
border because Russia was 
not at wa r then -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- with Ge rmany. But  they were very careful. So they took us on a horse and buggy, and -- 

over the woods, it was still twilight -- it was 
like not yet day, you know, like four o™clock, five 
o™clock in the morning. And my 
mother was sitting in the wagon, also spread with the hay, and 
the horse took us and the soldiers
 in front with the carabine, y
ou know, with the rifle, and we 
went. How long I don™t reme mber, it was long en
ough, over the woods, then we came on the sk -
- on the skirts of the woods. There was a city. I 
see a city because I reme mber Wa rsaw was a big 
city, big houses and people running, this and 
that, and he brought us to the synagogue in 
Bialystok. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. We came with the Russian
 soldiers, with this, to Bi al

know, and -- and they were look
ing. And my mom started to ye

Moishe, you know, his name . And all of a s
udden somebody came to my mom and say, ﬁ Who do 
you looking for? ﬂ [speaks foreign language he

Szlinger,ﬂ she said. ﬁOh, Moishe Szlinger, I kno

husband.ﬂ ﬁI saw him.ﬂ He called another ma n, and 
he says, ﬁDo you know where Moishe Szlinger is
?  That™s his wife and children.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁMoishe, yeah, he has to come . He went some wh
ere, but he has to come .ﬂ Anyway, my father 
appeared after awhile, and we were all crazy 
crying. I hugged him by the feet because he was a 
tall ma n. And he -- he held my brother in 
his arm, and my moth
er, crying, everybody hugging, 
happy that we are alive. And he said, okay, now 
we going to stay here, we™ll find a place. After 
two days my  mo m find a job. There wa s a lot of
 Polish and Jewish rich people in Bialystok. 
They spoke Yiddish, Polish and Russian because 
it was on the border. To tell you the truth, the -- 
Bi-Bialyst ok Jews, according to my mom and fat her™s
 st ory, were not pleasant to us. They call us 
in Russian the runner ise -- th
e runner ups, the runners. They
 call it biezency in Russian. 
Biezency is people who are running. Biezency. So 
my mo m find a job in a very good fa mily. She 
was cooking, cleaning, washing, 
and we were staying with 
them. My father left -- 
Q: Again? 

A: -- again. My father was invol
ved with politics, he knew what
 was going on, that the German 
are still looking, you know. Bialystok is still Polis
h, but any day it can beco
me  either Russian, or 
Germany comes there. So --  

Q: So the Russians had not occupied it yet, nor the Germans. 

A: No, the Russians, no. The Russians were in 
between, you know?  So it was like already end of 
1939, winter. We  stood there a few months and then
 they -- there was rumors, there was writings 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513

that if Jews from Poland want to go to Russia to
 work for a year, they have to sign out papers 
that they going to be in Russia working, and afte
r a year if they want to stay, they become  
Russian citizens. 
Q: Excuse me . Uh-huh. 

A: My father came to my mo m and say, ﬁPerla, 
what do you mean?  To go or not? ﬂ  She say, ﬁI™m 
going. I don™t want to come to Warsa w because I 
don™t know if they are alive. Let™s sign.ﬂ So 
they signed. There were people around us, Polis
h, Russian speaking, and they signed like an 
affidavit to become  Rus s ian citizens and work in Russia. So they took -- 

Q: So this means that  the Russians are actually in Bialystok? 

A: In Bialystok, yeah. There was a border be
tween Poland, and it was like a neutral city. 
Everybody was there. So, there was a big gatheri
ng and my father discussed it with the mo m. 
Q: And did you hear that conversation? 

A: I hear -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- but I didn™t comprehend what is -- I -- later, 
when I became  older, I 
ask all the question and 
we talked about it. 

Q: Right. 

A: How we came, why we came. 
So my father said to me , we came and we saved our lives. 
Q: Right. 

A: And all my brothers and si
ster we nt to the ghetto. Butthat™s later, I will tell you -- 
Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
32 
 
 
A: -- how we found out. So we signed and they send us
 to a border town, it™s called Ufa. It was -- 
I don™t know what kind -- because they have the 
oldest countries in Russia separated by this. 
Ufa, you ca -- spell it U-f-a. 

Q: Right. 

A: It™s [speaks foreign language here]. Because
 there were ma ny ethnic pe ople in Russia then, 

after the revolution. 

Q: Right. 

A: They each had their own like, unity. So we we
nt to Ufa for a year. They signed to work. We  
came there, it was bitter cold, winter, snow up to
 -- over the head. They took me  and my brother 
to like a kindergarten. They c -- it™s a center fo
r children, it™s for six da
ys a week. The seventh 
day they could take the children to their homes 
and return them the next day. We  had food and 
clothing, whatever. There were ma ny orphans ther
e. They call it Yasly, 
Yasly like a kindergarten 
for younger children, you know, not -- th
ere is another word for that,too, but it™s for little kids, 
you know?   

Q: So how did your mother and father explain to you, because you™ve not -- you™re not used to 

being away from the m at all. 

A: I said, we cried. 

Q: You cried. 

A: We  cried.

she used to carry this heavy stuff to put it away. 
And my father worked also

Q: So -- 

A: Probably it was military, I think. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It was a secret, but I assume d whe n we were
 talking, there was then
 a secret, my mom was 
carrying bricks, and this, and once 
the brick fell on her leg and sh

cast. And that was for one year. And I reme mbe r
 on Saturday night they used to pick us up. 
Saturday afternoon after work, and the road was 
full of snow, and there was a railroad in the 
mi ddle, we were walking on the railroad. 

Q: On the tracks?  

A: Another railro -- road, regular railroad, a

mountains of snow all over, that -- my father 
was tall, he couldn™t reach
 the top of it, you know?  
And they used to carry us, my mom, and my br
other and I was holding their hands. And all of a 
sudden you hear [indecipherable] was the -- the 
locomotive, toot too, like a long -- they knew

 saw from far away the locomotive comi ng, he 
threw me  on the slope of the -- of the snow, and my brother -- 

Q: On the other. 

A: -- to the other si de, and they were standi ng

through, the wagons, everything. We  were freezin

such a prince. He -- he was al
ways uncomfortable, always hungr
y. He could not take anything 
different, you know, that™s it™s discomforting. Always 
crying. So when this is -- we were used to 
it already because it happen all the time, they
 threw us over, you know, on the snow. And they 
lived in a little room with a kitchen, so we had 
food, and this, and the next day they took us when 
they were going to work, they took us back to
 that kindergarten wher
e all the children were. 
Q: So what did you do with your parents on the da

with you?  Did -- do you reme mber? 
A: We  didn™t have toys. 

Q: Right. 

A: They fed us. We  -- we -- they told stories, we
 were singing. My father 
liked to sing and dance 
and my mom had a won -- beautiful
 voice. And I s -- we sang all the Yiddish Polish songs with 
them. Me, I loved them. And the next day they we nt to work, they brought us back. Th-The --

Tata.ﬂ And they look at me , I have no hair. Th

 I was too fast a -- an adult, grown-up child. I 
was small and short and skinny, but my

 of perfect time . 
A: Oh my, you will have a lot of tape. 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
43 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Sarah, before we get to where we actually en
ded on the last tape, I wanted to ask you about 
ma laria. You said that you kids were lo
cked in a room, and you were just alone? 
A: Yes. 
Q: How in heaven™s name was that -- 

A: We ll, my  -- we were -- it was in Ukraine, in D
onbass, and we lived at this little room from the 

Russian old lady who rented to 
us, and me  and my brother got
 sick. And all of a sudden -- 
ma laria is like you have the chills, and you st
art shivering, and you shaking, your body™s shaking 
and then you cannot even say a word. Your teeth 
are teetering. And all -- when the temperature 
goes away, you feel cold, norma l. It™s only wh
en you have the high fever you start shivering. 

And my mom didn™t have 
a choice, she had to leave us alone
. Actually, I di dn™t st ar t fro m the 
beginning. It was 1941 in Ukraine when my fatherwas taken to the Russian army, to the front. 

Mom and us  two children were left in Ukraine, and she worked and we got sick. 
Q: Oh, you got sick af
ter your father left. 
A: Yes, yes -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- yes. We got sick, and she had to work. So
 the babushka, the woma n, the older lady that we 
called Babushka, it™s like grandma, she was ve
ry good to us. She used to bring water, or 
whatever she could give us, a li
ttle bit soup to eat. But we act
ually stayed by ourselves in the 
room. And I cover -- when I was sick and shiv
ering, my brother covered me , and I covered him 
when he needed to be pampered. A
nd we stayed alone. We  stayed alone. 
Q: How long did it take before you got
 better?  Do you reme mber?  Weeks? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
44 
 
 
A: Maybe a -- weeks -- ma ybe weeks, yeah. Wh en 
we got better, the temperature broke, we were 
very weak, and tired, and sick. We  couldn™t wa
lk. It was very har
d, and we didn™t have 
me dication. They should give us canine -- caneen? 
Q: Quinine. 

A: Quinine. 

Q: Quinine, right. 

A: Qanina they call it in Russian. Once my mother 
got a dose of that from a doctor they gave us, 
but that was all, we -- we just
 had to recover by ourselves. Dri
nking water, or crying and that was 
all. 

Q: So how long did it take before you could wa
lk again, and you weren™t so weak?  Do you re -- 
A: It tooks week -- weeks. Slowly we ma de st
ep by step in the house holding by the furniture, 

like this, holding on, standing up, walking. And 
my brother was alwa
ys holding me  by my 
clothes, or I hold his hand. He 
never was separated, never. And 
since his death, I mi ss him very 
much. We  were very close. We  had a lot 
of good me mories, and he called me  Ma ma .  
Q: He did.  

A: He called -- 

Q: As a -- as a child, too? 

A: As a child. And I beat him up. I say, I™m not your ma ma. 

Q: You beat him up?  

A: Yeah. I say, ﬁMordechai, don™t call me  ma ma , I™m not your ma ma .ﬂ You know, I was seven, 

eight years old -- 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
45 
 
 
A: -- how can I be your ma ma?  You called me  
mama . So I was angry, and as a child, I -- I 
wanted to defend myself to be more ma ture. 
I don™t want you to call me ma ma, I™m not your 
ma ma. I™m your sister, Sarah. We  s poke Russian 
then. We -- with my mom we spoke Yiddish 
and Polish and with him,  he was little, he didn™
t know Yiddish or Polish then, spoke Russian to 
me . So we s poke Russian. 
Q: So did he change?  Did he call you 
sister?  Or did he 
always call you mama ?  
A: Oh yeah, later on, yeah.  

Q: Yes.  

A: He -- you saw the pictures, a very big ma
n, very caring, very love
ly, good looking ma n. He 
has -- I -- I mi ss hi m ve ry much. M y brother died 
of cancer of the liver, and he had diabetes. And 
the last time  I visited Israel in 
November, and I si -- I took him to th
e Dead Sea, to -- I knew he is 
sick, to gi ve him some good time together, becau
se my younger sister, who was so spoiled by us, 
we were taking care of her as a child, has no feeli
ngs. And she doesn™t even 
talk to --  she didn™t 
talk to my brother, and doesn™t talk to me .  

Q: Mm. 

A: I don™t understand. We are from the same  
parents, and everybody has a different attitude. 
Maybe because me  and my brother were always a
ttached to the hip becaus
e of the war, because 
of being by ourselves. We didn™t 
have any trauma , no -- no problems to be with one another, 
always looked for me . Even when I was 14 - 15 in Poland, used to go out with boys, and have 

friends and he always wanted to come  to me . I 
chased him away. I said, ﬁGo home .ﬂ ﬁI will tell 
Mom that you™re going out with boys.ﬂ I said, ﬁA
ll right. I™m going out with boys, these are my 
friends, you go home .ﬂ It was very 
hard to separate
 him from me. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
46 
 
 
A: But we were very close all the time, even t
hough I went to America, and he in Israel, we 
always kept in touch. 
Q: Right. 

A: He ma rried twice, he had th
e first wife, that™s -- you saw th
e picture, Tamara, she™s from 
Morocco Jews, Moroccan Jews, a nice family. They have two children, a daughter, Anat, she™s 

now 46 or some thing, and name d a son, Moishe, af
ter my fa ther, Mojes -- Moishe in Hebrew. 
And Moishe has two beautiful daughters. A
nd now it was born on my 
brother™s birthday, 
December 14, 2006, a boy was born, looks exactly like my brother. 

Q: Really? 

A: And they call him M ordechai Eli, and I spoke
 to them, they say that he is a copy of 
Mordechai. I hope to see them. 

Q: I hope so too.  

A: I hope to see them. Very lovely, I love them
 very much, and I am a very fa mily oriented 
person. I love my fa-fa mily, I like my child
ren, my grandchildren, 
everybody. I don™t have 
grudges against nobody because my life was hard a
nd I now will not concentrate on being angry 
at some body or being against some body or hating so
me body. I always find love in my heart for 
other people to be helpful. And I mi s s my brother.  

Q: Right, I bet you do. 

A: I mi ss him very muc h. 

Q: Do y -- do you reme mber the day your father left to go to the Russian army?  

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: What was that like? 

A: We  didn™t understand too much. My mo m cried. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513

Q: You were six. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: 1941, right?  So you -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- were six years old. Or five. 

A: He was a tall, nice looking ma n, slim. And he
 said to us not to cry. He hugged me , my 
brother, my mom, he said it wou -- ﬁThe war will 
not last long, and I will be back. You just be 
good to one another, help your mo m, and be good to 
your brother.ﬂ I say, ﬁYes, I will, but I want 
you to come  back.ﬂ He say, ﬁI will.ﬂ So, when
 he left for the army, we di dn™t know anything 
where he is, what he is doing, no letters, nothi
ng. We  did not receive. 
So, when my -- the war 
started in ™41, we stayed a few mont hs with the -- in the Ukra
ine with that woma n, Ba bushka we 
call her, grandma. She was a very nice person, 
but my mom say, ﬁI™m not going to stay in 
Ukraine.ﬂ I -- she say, ﬁWhy Perlina?ﬂ Perlina -- 
she was Perla in Yiddish, but in Russian they 
call he r Perlina. And -- ﬁWhy?  Stay here. We ™
ll take care of the children, you will work.ﬂ My 
mom say, I have -- she told me  later, ﬁI have me
mory from my father, born in Kiev, and telling 
me  stories about anti-Semitism in Ukraine, how
 much they were agains t Jews.ﬂ And they 
collaborated with the Germans, Ukraines, a lot 
of them. So my mother
 reme mbered that, her 
father™s st ory, and she evacuated. There was like a Jewish Polish organiza
tion that they provided. 
So we were staying in a differe
nt place, and I don™t reme mbe r
 exactly, not long. And then we 
find out -- oh, my father™s brother, Yukel, a
nd his wife, and daughter 
and son were living in 
Magnito Gorsk. It™s in Ur al. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513

A: They found that my father was wounded, a
nd he was living in Sh
chyokino, two -- near the 
forest --  
Q: Near Tula. 

A: Tula. 

Q: Right. 

A: So, some how he -- he tried, my mother tried 
to write and there was li
ke a Polish organization. 
There was a Polish writer woma n, was name d Wanda Wa szylewska. You call it with a W, 

Wanda Waszylewska. She was a writer and very
 active for Jews and 
Polish people to come  
together to live like a Polish
 society. And through her we find 
where my father is and through 

my -- my uncle that they were keeping track of Jewish people and Polish people from Poland. 

And we traveled, and my mo m, my -- me, my -- 
my brother in trains, it was very far away. 
Q: Yes, I imagine, from -- 

A: Yes. We travel ed all over Russi
a. They were not elegant trains, 
it was like cattle trains. Hay in 
the mi ddle, and there was a little stove, not to k
eep -- to keep warm, not c old. So one day we had 
bread that wa s like put in the 
oven, and like toasted. Dry bread to
asted in a sack. And we were 
transferred from one train to a
nother, and Mom gave me  the sack
 to hold on my back, that sack 
with bread. It was not that heavy because it 
was dry, it was not heavy. And pef -- people were 
running and pushing to go into the trains, and -- 
cattle train actually, 
it was very high up, there 
was no steps down, nothing. They did not provide 
any luxury for the refugees. And I reme mber 
some body pulled me  up to the train and my mo
m was behind and pushing 
my brother up. So I 
held my brother™s hand and in one hand I had the 
sack. All of a sudden I feel light, there is no 
sack. Some body took it away, we never find it. 
We  cried. We  didn™t have our chlebushka, you 

know, like my brother cried, Mama , chlebushka? 
Mama , give me  bread. He was always hungry 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
49 
 
 
and he always cried. Chlebushka. I call him ch
lebushka always, you know?  That -- that was the 
Russian word for bread, but in a very nickname
 like -- like endearing. 
It™s called chleb in 
Russian. 
Q: Bread. 

A: But chlebushka is some thing like -- like some body you love, you call babushka, like this, you 

know, they -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- add. So that was chlebushka for him, and we
 didn™t have it. Imagin
e in such a situation, 
people running, hungry, some body st eals from a child, th
at sack with the -- we call it suchary, 
suchary, that dry bread. And we 
didn™t have what to eat, and 
the train was going and going with 
no stop. We  didn™t know where we going.  

Q: Oh, you weren't sure where you were going? 

A: Mm- mm, we didn™t know. And when it stoppe
d, everybody run out, because people -- excuse, 
were relieving themself
 on the hay there. 
Q: Right. 

A: On the straw. So when there™s a train stop, 
we have to get -- jump down and go pee or do 
some other things. And sometime the 
train all of a sudden start moving. 
Q: Right. 

A: So my mom threw me to 
one wagon, my brother too, and some body grabbed her by the hand 
to pull her to another wa gon. 

Q: Into another wagon.  

A: And the train goes and goes, how long we
 don™t know, and we cry, Mama , Ma ma , we both 
cry. And finally, after a few hours it stops, so my
 mom ca me  r unning to us, hugged us. We cried, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
50 
 
 
because we were happy to see. So my mo m sa
y, never again we go, we always keep hands 
together. Whatever happen, happen. And the trains,at the station, they had 
hot water. They call it 
in Russian ki piatok, kipiatok it™s like boiling wate
r. And we get the hot water and whoever had a 
piece of bread put it in that water so we have 
some thing warm to -- to have for the stomach, you 
know?  So -- 
Q: But you didn™t have any food? 

A: No. But they gave us some , Russians. 

Q: They did? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: A piece of bread a day, or whatever, they ga ve  us some , so we save for the next  day. I always 

saved bread. I cut like a small piece and put under 
the pi llow, it was not a pillow like here, soft 
and comfortable. Some thing that you put under your
 head, and I always kept a piece of bread 
hidden. And when my brother cried for chlebushka, 
to get bread, I always got a piece and gave it 
to him, and he was satisfied and happy. We  were
 very attached to one another. And then we 
come , after months of traveling, we come  to Tula. 
That™s the city not far 
from Moscow, that city 
Tula, and from Tula the organizat-zation, a Poli
sh organization brought us together and they 

transfer us to Shchyokino, wh
ere my  father was, you know? 
Q: So your father was not in Tula -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- he was in Shchyokino. 

A: It was cold in the Russian Gora Shchyoki
no, the city of Shchyokino, and Tulskaya Obles, 
Tula like -- like Wa shington [indecipherab
le] Maryland, yeah?  That was the region.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
51 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: Tulskaya Obles, the -- the suburbs or whatev
er, of Tula. Tula was not far away, but it was a 
nice, big city, because later we went there. A
nd my father lived in a place called in Russian 
obszy zycie, it™s communal life
, communal life like a community in barracks. Everybody had a 
bed like two, four or five people in one room, 
with a small petition lik
e in the hospital, you 
know, they have this curtain -- 

Q: Curtain. 

A: -- on the bed, and -- and we didn™t see our father
 for a long time, I didn™t recognize him. He 
got -- he was wounded in the -- in his leg, so he li
mped a little bit. But he got skinny and not the 
father I remember. And we were also children th
at grew a little bit and 
got skinny, without hair. 
Q: So you -- 

A: So we all cried. We  cried. It was like kind of
 frightened of him, the wa y he looked. And he 

cried to find us and my mom. 
And life started. So, as a family, we got a little room, separate 
from the place where he stayed single. We  got a 
little room, a long, little
 co -- like the same  
width, but longer, with one window, two beds with
 straw mattresses and a stove in the mi ddle, 
like they call it [speaks Russian here], the Ru
ssian stove that you burn on coal or wood, and no 
gas. And no running water, never in the house, not -- 
Q: You haven™t had running wa
ter for a very long time. 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: We used to carry, my mom 
-- in the Russia, if you see Russi
an old movies, you have like a -- 
a wooden [indecipherable] like 
it™s half round and it has two hooks, one hook for one pail, and 
the other, and you carry it on 
your shoulder like this, with th
e -- I used to carry that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
52 
 
 
Q: Really? 
A: Mm-hm. But smaller buckets, you know? 

Q: Right, because you were smaller.  

A: I used to sit down, kneel it -- kneel, and then
 pick it up with my shoulder, and stand up. And 
of course the water was -- because I was shaking,
 not steady on my legs, so this was spilling, you 
know, spill. But I run, barefoot, and was summer
time, and we didn™t have clothes enough and 
my mo m, fr om whatever she could do over her 
clothes she sew for me  like a sarafan, you know, 
like with no sleeves underneath, you wear a bl
ouse and whatever. And that™s what -- and 
barefoot all summer long we run ba
refoot, and I had a glass splinters
 in my legs, and wood in my 
legs, and you ask he -- I looked li
ke a tomboy. I was very active. My
 hair was shaven, still cor -- 
short, didn™t have hair. 

Q: Right. 

A: Just a little bit in fr ont, like here, and straight
, with fr eckles. I still have fr eckles, I cover them 
with -- 

Q: Not too ma ny. You cover them up. 

A: -- with ma ke-up a little bit. With fr eckles, my
 brother also had freckle
s. I even have on my 
hands freckles. But -- and then we were 
happy to be together 
with my father.  
Q: How long did it take you to ge
t used to your fa ther again? 
A: Oh, it took awhile, months. 

Q: It did? 

A: I -- yeah. And he -- 

Q: We re you frightened of hi m in some  way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
53 
 
 
A: No, we were not frightened. It just -- he wa
s not the same  person like we reme mb er, warm 
and loving. He was like keeping distance from 
the army, from being wounded, and he start 
drinking, and the -- they taught hi
m how to drink alcohol. He star
ted to drink, so -- he worked 
very hard, he  worked with iron. They were me
lting iron in a big factor
y, and ma king like all ki nd 
of -- I don™t know, a mmunition or  whatever, parts or
 whatever. He worked very hard, and they 
were rationing us with bread. So while he was wo
rking very hard, a physi
cal job, he got a ration 
of bread daily, a kilo bread. Kilo bread is li
ke two -- two and some thing pounds. A kilo bread. 
My mo m ha d a half of it, half a 
kilo bread, and we got together, me
 and my brother, half a kilo. 
So we had two kilo breads, which you will think it™s a 
lot, yeah, it™s like a 
loaf of bread for four 
people. But except bread, we didn™t 
have anything to eat. We  didn™
t have butter, we didn™t have 
ma r malade, we didn™t have any butter or whatev
er. And my mom used to say, in Yiddish she 
say, ﬁGod, when I am going to eat a piece of white
 br ead with butter? ﬂ I looked at her, ﬁMama, 
what is butter? ﬂ [speaks foreign language here].
 You know it?  That™s what she wanted. White 
bread -- 
Q: Bread with butter. 

A: -- with butter. Then I went to school -- 

Q: Tell me  some thing. Were you sick at 
all, you and -- besides the ma laria -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- because of not getting proper nutrition? 

A: That™s right. At this place, we got sick with 
the eyes. My a -- my eyes and my brother™s eyes, 
when it come evening, we  didn™t see anything. Why 
-- and his eyes got swollen with a lot of pus 
comi ng out, like -- like this, like balloons. My -- we 
didn™t see, we were walking like blind, like 
this, you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
54 
 
 
Q: At night? 
A: In the evening, yes. 

Q: Evening. 

A: Stretching my brother behind me , holdi
ng me like this, and I was walking like -- 
Q: What was [indecipherable] 

A: -- like a zombie. We didn™t know
. Later I find out. My mother took 
us to the doctors there, to 
a clinic and they used to put ve
ry strong drops into our eyes. It
 was burning like hell. We cried 
just that when she touched us. They put drops 
and she washed our eyes with some  lukewarm 
water, with the nice cleaning, you know, ma  -- fabr
ic. So she wiped our eyes. During the day it 
was fi ne, we could see. When evening came -- 
they call it in Russian 
-- I will say and then 
translate kurina slepota. Kurina means chicken b
lindness. That™s how they call it. It wa s not a 
professional me dical name . 

Q: Right. 
A: But that was the symptoms that a lot of pe
ople, usually children, had because we didn™t have 
vitami ns, we didn™t have pr
oper food and hygiene, nothing. 
Q: Right. 
A: So that™s -- children we
re dying like flies there. 
Q: Of that? 

A: Yeah. Not just from that. 

Q: From other things. 

A: They had brain sickness. They were swollen. 

Q: They had what sickness?  Whe -- 

A: Brain. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
55 
 
 
Q: Brain. 
A: The brain -- was attacking the children™s br ain,
 they died like flies. We -- remember  that 
every othe r day we lived in a barr ack, it was --  each one had their own, like  30 fa milies and we 

knew one another. Every other day 
there was a -- a funeral for th
e children. And one fa mily, two, 
three kids died. They got swollen and this and br
ain dama ge or whatever, fever, and they died. 
And you know, out of this sadness, we run to th
e cemetery because there was a tradition that 
when they buried some body, they gave you a little
 bit -- a small pi ece of bread with honey. And 

this for us, it™s irony, it™s sad, 
was like a holiday to get a piece
 of bread with honey, we never 
saw honey. 

Q: Right. 

A: And that was a tradition. And they were buried, 
a lot of friends I reme mber, in particular one 
little girl with blue eyes, her name  wa s Nina
. And then her brother, younger brother died, too. 
But life mus t  go on. We  had -- I went to school -- I 
went to second grade, 
third grade. I learned 
very fast Russian, to write in Russian and rea
d. We didn™t have books, or didn™t have paper to 
write, like you have nice paper. My father cut 
up from the newspaper the white side, sewed it up 
with the needle and thread and I used to writ
e on this my home work and everything. I-It™s not a 
fairy tale --  

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- it™s the truth, I reme mber that. And -- 

Q: So he sewed these strips
 of paper together so -- 

A: Yeah, this -- the white st
rips from the newspaper. 
Q: -- so that you woul
d have a whole -- 
A: Yeah, that I could write, you know?
 It was clean, narrow and long -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
56 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- so I could -- and we  had not a pen that you ha
ve ink inside. We  had a 
inker, a little thing 
and we put the pen into the ink -- 

Q: Right, so you write. 

A: -- and write til it end. And we put spots on 
it, you know, they were spreading li -- 
Q: Right. 

A: We  call it clocks 

Q: Especially on the newspaper it would spread. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: We  have to stop the tape.  

A: Okay. Oh my God. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
57 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: We  ended where you were going to school, but I 
want to go back to a
ll of these sicknesses 
and the children dying. 
A: Okay. 

Q: Wa s this very hard on you -- 

A: Very. 

Q: -- to see all these children? 

A: Yes. 

Q: We re you -- 

A: We  were actually very scared. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And especially my pa rents. You couldn™t 
help it, what™s -- was happening, it was like an 
epidemic. 
Q: Right. 
A: And young children were dying. Nobody could expl
ain why and how it come s, they just got 

swollen, got high fever, like a brain fever or what
ever, and then the next day or two they were 
gone. And was -- 

Q: So it was really fast, also? 

A: It was fast, it was fast and 
there were too ma ny children age 
six, seven, like that, died. And 
out of that tragedy that I understand today, we were
 happy to run to the cemetery to get this piece 
of bread with honey. 

Q: Yes. So it was -- 

A: Can you imagine -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
58 
 
 
Q: Yes, I can imagine -- 
A: -- that  survival  -- 

Q: -- what survival does. 

A: -- that survival does. We were crying. I reme
mber that Ninotchka -- her name  was Ninotchka 
with blue eyes, blonde hair, Russian child, was 
beautiful, always playi
ng, she was chubby. And I 
was the skinny one and the mother some time br
ought me  a piece of potato, like baked in the 
oven. They call it kartoshka in Ru
ssian. And they were very nice people, Russian people, the 

peasants or whatever. They were very hospitable. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Very nice people. And we live like
 brothers and sisters, we  played. 
Q: Then she died. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. 
A: A lot. And then her little brothe
r died, too [indecipherable]. I reme m -- 
Q: We re you scared? 
A: Of course. 

Q: You were scared. 

A: But we didn™t understand about dead too much, b
ecause they said -- they were very religious, 
the people, the Russian and they 
said that they go to heaven. 
I ask my mom what is heaven 
because we were not religious 
at all. We knew Jewish, we kne
w we Jewish, and my mom say, 
ﬁIn heaven it™s a pl ace of like beautiful trees, be
autiful green flowers and 
nice weather and all the 
people are happy and playing together
, children, so she went to heaven.ﬂ So one day I cry, I say, 
ﬁI don™t want to go to heaven.ﬂ She say, ﬁW
hy? ﬂ I say, ﬁBecause she™s not around here. I mi ss 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
59 
 
 
her and if I go to heaven I will not see you or my 
brother.ﬂ I already st arted to think about things 
like that. I say, ﬁI don™t want to go to heaven, I 
want to be here with you.ﬂ And my mom hugge d 
me , she say, ﬁOkay Surele, you™re not going to heav
en. You™re growing old here, and this is the 
hell.ﬂ So we live -- we are in hell now.  
Q: Did you get sick again, or was it the eye sickness, ma ybe -- 

A: No, after the eye si ckness, we were eating 
better, because my mo m worked and my  father 
worked, and they had a lot of -- we didn™t 
have enough bread probably, but there was on the 
ma rket always, potatoes, or a carrot to
 buy and this, and she cooked soup, you know?   
Q: Mm. 

A: She cooked a lot of soup with bread, if you can.And so we put a piece 
of bread like this, in 
the spoon like that, it wa s dripping -- 

Q: Dripping onto the bread 

A: -- so we don™t lose the liquid, so it went 
on the bread, and then the bread was, you know, e-
eaten. 

Q: Right. 

A: It was very dear, like a commod
ity. If you give me  today gold, I wi
ll not cherish that like that 
piece of bread and soup. Then my si ster came . We
 did not know that Mom is pregnant and I di d 

not understand. I was already nine years old. 

Q: Right. 

A: It was ™45, ni -- April of ™45, and my mo m got
 sick. We  thought that my mo m is going to die, 
me  and my brother, we cried. We
 didn™t know, they didn™t tell us what sh -- what is -- I saw my 
mom a little bit rounded like she is gaining we
ight. Looks good, and she worked, and that was 
all, you know?  In the meantime, in the summer, I 
was running with the girls, dancing, they had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
60 
 
 
music or they play and dance, you know the Russi
an folks dances, they --
 they sing chastushki, 
chastushki means like the -- the 
couplets, like the words that -- 
the folk songs about girls and 
boys loving one another and this a
nd singing. I reme mber the songs.  
Q: [indecipherable] can you sing one of them?  
A: Yeah. 

Q: All right. 

A: [sings in Russian] 

Q: So what does that me an? 

A: Oh, that™s what -- like pay attention to th
at song, put your ears on t
op of your head so you 
hear better, because they going to
 sing that folk song chastushki 
-- there is no explanation what 
chastushki is, so it will be -- you will be very 
happy about that. And then
 you ma ke ee-ee noises 
and dance and you™re like this, like that, you know
, the Russian folks dancer, have you seen 
someti me Russian folk dancers -- 
Q: Really [indecipherable] 
A: -- or th-they™re -- they™re
 very like country songs. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Right, like square dancers?  That
™s -- that ™s what , very ni ce, and 
I was an expert in that with 
the girls. Always Szurka, Szurka, they call me  
Szurka, [indecipherable] go dance. I say no, I was 
shy in the beginning. But then I -- I dance and sang. Barefoot, of course. 

Q: Always barefoot. 

A: We  didn™t have shoes. So, it was very happy, 
and there were bigger girls, and in summertime 
they had woods, beautiful woods -- forest. They us
ed to go summertime to the forest, the girls, 
like they were ma ybe 12 - 14 or older. Nice Russian 
girls, only girls, going to the woods to pick 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
61 
 
 
berries, they had white berries, 
wild. Wild nuts growing, with th
e green things. And some ti me s 
we had, like in the spring, on the fields, some  potat
oes leftover from the previous years, so they 
were frozen from the winter, we picked. So I to
ld my mo m, ma ke a sack. From a sac k, ma ke like 
a -- a -- like a rucksack, to have strings here -- 

Q: So you can put them in a bag. 

A: -- so put it together, string it
, and I have it on my bag, whatever I pick. And then she gave me  
a big container with the cl
ose-up, you know, and a mu -- a long one, like a pail, and 
[indecipherable] in the summer, four  -- four o™cloc
k in the summer, the girl
s didn™t want to take 
me  with them. They were older and they were afra
id that  I will star t cr ying, I will be  tire d, so 
they always when they saw me , Szurka, go home .
 You not comi ng with us to the woods. We ™re 
not going to take, there is a bri
dge to cross, there is water,
 you can fall in. We don™t want you. 
But I will pick for you. I will help you pick berr
ies, everythi ng. Please take me. I will not cry. 
No, you go home . So what I do?  I 
told my mom, I was crying, I 
say ﬁThey don™t want to take 
me .ﬂ And she say, ﬁThey™re right
. You a little girl and you don™t go 
there, we don™t need that.ﬂ I 
say, ﬁMom, I am going.ﬂ So what I did, I woke 
up earlier, like two o™clock in the morning. I 
didn™t sleep probably a whole night
, and it was like grayish outside, in the summer, i-it™s like 
April, May, some thing, I was going. I went by myself.

It was like 24 hours, from time whe n he went 
to work, it was like 24 hour
s, then he came home . 
He was earning good mo ney, and bread, you know. Ther

my mo m start to moan and she woke me  up, Su

she spoke to me  in Yiddish, not in Russian,

ﬁGo and bring that babushka.ﬂ There was an 
old lady. It was like from our place to go through 
a railroad that was a slope going up -- up, and 
there was a railroad and then you go down to 
the village, and I knew where she lived, the 
babushka. So, it was almost three in the morning, I 
run, and it was April. It was raining before, it 
was mud all over because the roads were not paved, 
there were no roads in the village. And I put 
my mother™s shoes, of course, her size was, I 
think, 39 then, and I was little. I put my mother™s

, I don™t reme mber what I put, something, and 
I running and crying, running and crying. And that

should not die, my mother is sick. I go fast to
 -- to get babushka, she will help her. So, the 
babushka lived in a small hut also, nobody had 
a hou -- tall houses, nobody. 
It was a barrack, one 
room and that™s it. No luxuries. So I knocked in
 the window, in the babushka™s window. M -- she 
was prepared. She told my mother, if some thin
g happened to you, send Szuritska -- send Szura to 
call me, and I will come. So, I knocked in the 
window a few times, nobody answer, and I start 
screaming, ﬁBabushka, Babushka, come , my mo m is
 dying.ﬂ In Russian [speaks Russian]. I -- I 
thought my mom is dying. So she say, Szurka, lik
e this, she was an old woma n -- I don™t know, 
ma ybe she was not old then. She was wearing that
 scarf on the head. A short woma n, blue eyes, I 
reme mber her. We call her babushka, we didn™t 
know the name . And the babushka came  out, she 
said to me , ﬁRelax, what happened? ﬂ I say, ﬁM
ama is dying, Mama is in pain, Mama is dying. 
She send me  to you to come .ﬂ Okay. So we™re ru
nning, running, and there is water, dark, and my 
mother™s shoes were stuck in the mud, and I left it 
there. I didn™t have time
 to go ba ck to ge-get 
it, so I took the other shoe off, I™ m barefoot, I 
run, and I reme mber where that shoe is, you know?  

So, my mo m™ s shoes, and she came to the r
oom, she saw my  mother, she took me and my 
brother out, pushed us out of the door. And sh

come in.ﬂ We don™t know 
what happened to Mom, we crying. My brother 
even more than me , he was crying. He say, 
ﬁ What happened to mo m, she is going to die.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁDon™t worry Mordechai. Stay put quiet, be 
quiet. We  won™t -- we don™t know, ma ybe she w
ill not di e. The babushka will help.ﬂ We -- I 
don™t know how long we stayed, a few hours.

coat. Covered, we only see the face. Is me owi
ng like a kitten. Meow-ow. Sh-she was born very 
little, very weak. My mo m didn™t have what to eat.
 So she said, the babushka, ﬁThis is your little 

sister.ﬂ Now we -- we were happy that Mom didn™

When there was, in the mi ddle of the night, if there was special

May fifth, 1945, and the speaker is d

But he announced during the war and after, all the news, what™s happening on the front. So he --

about the war, do you also hear 
about camps, do you hear about death factories? 

A: Yeah, yes. 

Q: You do?  In -- in Russia, you do? 

A: Yeah, yes. People actually came  before th

community that we lived, and I was going to sc
hool, and there were also Russian propaganda, 
and they were telling about 
concentration camps, I knew a
bout Auschwitz, Dachau --

not understand exactl
y, as a child, what it is the atrocity. 
Q: But you -- but you knew the name s. 

A: I knew. 

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: And whe n we came back to Poland after that
, and we came in July of ™45, we came  to Poland, 

it took a few months after the war, not too long, 
because of the organization and w-we came to 
the city, not to Warsaw where my -- my father
 and mo m was born, we came  to Wr ocl a w, it was 
before Germany -- 

Q: Breslau. 

A: Breslau. 

Q: Right.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
71 
 
 
A: Th-They call it [speaks foreign language here] 
taking over land. It used to belong to Silesia. 
In Silesia they call it 
Shlonsk in Poland. There™s upper Sile
sia and mi ddle Silesia in German, 
there™s a higher and lowe r Sile
sia. It still now belonged to 
Poland. That™s why we ca me. We  
came to Wr oclaw, a torn down, burned down city, huge city in ruins. We  came because my 
father™s brother Yukel with his family was ther
e. They me t us , Luba, my c ousin, his daughter, 
Yukel™s daughter, and the 
boy, Mordechai me t us. So my father ask, where is my brother, Yukel?  
So she burst into tears and she said that he is 
no more. He died a month 
ago. He had tuberculosis, 
he was very sick and hi s wife  Gitl died in Russi
a before that. So he cam
e to Poland with the two 
children. Luba was a lot older th
an me, 10 years older, and Mordechai, my cousin is two years 
older than me. So we came and the two, girl 
and boy had an apartment where they live and -- 
with the father. We came  to thei r apartmen
t, the four of us, how ma ny -- five of us. 
Q: Five of you now. 

A: Yeah, my sister was there, 
the baby, a few months old. She was 
born in April, that was July 
some thing, so she was a few months old, and 
we came to live with them. We didn™t have 
anything, no clothes,
 no nothing, no shoes. 
Q: So you came very quickly after the war -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- you didn™t wait in Russia. 

A: My father didn™t want to stay one single day 
longer and my  mo m. They 
wanted to come  home 
and seek if some body is still alive, because we  corresponded with them. They got letters in 

Russia from Warsaw up to 1943. They were writing 
-- that™s what my mom 
told me in Yiddish, 
that they have to leave their apartments, and they
 going to give them another apartments, all Jews 
together, it™s -- it was a ghetto creating in Wa
rsaw, but they didn't know a ny better what will 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
72 
 
 
happen to them. So don™t worry about 
us, the apartment that you left 
with the things is intact. We  
closed the doors and everything is being ch
ecked, and nobody touched anything. That was so 
important to them, the apartment with the furniture. 
Q: Right. 

A: To us it was not relevant 
then. What we went through, runni
ng away and leaving things -- 
while running you leave the heavy stuff because you cannot carry it. So -- and that was the end 

and we did not see one of them, nobody was aliv
e. They all perished in the Wa rsaw ghetto. 
Q: Did you go to war -- did your parents and you go to Wa rsaw first -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- and then -- and then brat -- 

A: No. First we came from Russia to Wr oclaw to 
live with his brother, and we didn™t find my -- 
my uncle alive, so we took another apartment ne
xt door, to live separate, and my cous in Luba, 
his -- Yukel™s daughter -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- was older, she was 18 or some thing, she wa
s working. A beautiful girl. And Mordechai, my 

cousin, was 14, and then they were creating 
kibbutz™s -- kibbutz fo
r young Jewish people to 
emigrate to Israel. Si nce he didn™t have a father
 and mother, at age of 14, when we came  we me t 
Mordechai, my cousin, very lovely, he was in a 
kibbutz already, Shomer Hatzair, they called the 
kibbutz, and he was on his way to emigrate to Isra
el. The sister, Luba was older, she didn™t want 
him to go, but he didn™t want to stay in Poland an
d he emigrated to Israel
, is still til today, he 
lives all his life in a kibbutz. He ma rried ther
e, he has a daughter, and he lives now in Golan 
Heights, Kibbutz Dafna. 

Q: And did he go before the State of Is
rael was formed, or after?  Do you know

ndecipherable] they were -- they ve
ry politically inclined, th-t hey 
were ma ybe brainwashed to go, young children -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- didn™t know any be
tter what Israel is. 
Q: Right. 

A: But they were fighting, and I know a lot of boys 
that volunteered to go 
to Israel to fight, and 
they nev -- I™ve never met them agai
n. They di -- they were not alive. 
Q: By the time  you ca me, mm-hm. 

A: They all perished there. But they were hero
es. They fought for the Eretz -- Eretz Israel, for 
their country. They were very patriotic, young people.
 We  settled in -- in Wr oclaw. I went to a 
Polish school nearby because I didn™t know to wr
ite and to read in Polish, only in Russian. 
Q: And you had gone t -- up to what grade in -- 

A: Three. Third. 

Q: Three?  

A: Mm-hm, third gr ade. 

Q: Third grade, and you were now 10 years old? 

A: 10 -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
74 
 
 
Q: 11 -- 11 years old. 
A: -- 11, yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Thir -- I went to Polish 
school, I didn™t know Polish, only Russi
an and Yiddish. And that was 
nearby, like second street from our
 house, and my mo m sent us to school because it was close, 
and that she didn™t ha ve to take us far away b
ecause she was working and my father. So we live 
in one room apartment with a kitchen, but ther
e was running water in th
e house, and electricity. 
Q: Oh, really, runni
ng water -- really? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Ever after the -- ev
en right after the war? 
A: Yeah, after the war, it was -- Wr o c law was avery beautiful German city. After the war was 

taking over, and I saw German people being thrown
 out from the apartments, took whatever they 
could with them. It was a long, 
long walk. And I stood with tears 
in my eyes, although Germans 
did a lot of atrocity to us, but they were chil
dren and old people, mostly, because young Germans 
were killed in the front or wh
atever. They were orphans with 
grandparents, walking and pushing 
the pushcarts in a long line. As a child that we
nt through a lot, I felt ve
ry sorry. Some  Polacks 
threw rocks at them. Farflucta ju -- Deutsche, 
they called them dirty 
Deutsch like they called 
farflucta Juden to us, the Germans.  
Q: Right. 

A: And at school, in the Polish sc
hool, I felt terrible. 
First of all the Pol
acks are all blonde 
mostly, blue eyes. I had dark hair. They pulled 
my hair all the time. Oh, look at that Jewess. 
[speaks Polish here]. You know in Polish [Polis
h] in a nice wa y, that Jewess has dark hair. 

Where did you come  from?  You killed our Jesus.
 I didn™t know what Jesus is, what religion, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
75 
 
 
nothing then. In Russia there was no religi
on, nobody talked about anything. I came home 
crying, dirty Jew, dirty Jew [Polish] like in Po
lish the parshiva like some body has a disease, you 
know, uncurable disease. I never 
seen such hatreds 
during the war with the Russian like I 
encountered in Poland. They were so against 
everything and everybody, es
pecially Jews. Jews 
killed Jesus, Jews are bad, we have to kill the 
Jews. I said to my mo m, I™m not going to that  

school. My mom said, where would 
you go?  It™s far away, this is 
close. I said, I™m not going to 
that school, they call me  name s and I don™t know 
even why. One day she went there and there 
was a priest, a young priest and she spoke to that
 priest. He was teachi
ng religion. I approached 
that priest, I said in Polish --I learned fast, I said [speaks 
Polish] you -- like your highness, 
priests, in Polish there™s an expression, ﬁCan 
I stay on the lesson when you teaching religion? ﬂ 
He say, ﬁWhy?  You not Catholic.ﬂ I says, ﬁWhat™
s the difference?  I want to know why they call 
me  dirty Jew, can you explain that to me ?  Am I 
dirty? I have dark hair, but I went through the 
war, and I am surviving, and now I came to free 
Poland, and I am a dirty Jew.ﬂ He said, ﬁ Well, 
I™ll give you a book about the New Testament, and if you don™t understand some thing, you ask.ﬂ 

I read that Ne w Testame nt, about how the worl
d was created, and about Jesus, where he was 
born and the Holy Mary. I see they are Jewish too, you know, they came from Israel, from 

Nazareth, from the -- Jesus Christ came from
 the dynasty of David the King. King David. I 
started to analyze, I said, ﬁWhy am I a dirty Jew?  
You also Jewish.ﬂ I asked the priest -- I started 
to -- to be more political. You also Jewish, becau
se  Jesus Christ and Holy Mary was Jewish. And 
I read the Ne w Testame nt, but I don™t know 
the Old Testament. I 
don™t know anything about 
religion because in my house they told us we 
are Jewish and that wa
s it. We didn™t go to 
synagogue, my parents didn™t go nowhere. There 
was later, a Jewish synagogue, beautiful, built 
800 years ago by Germa n Jews in that city, and Hitler used to come  to Wr oclaw and had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
76 
 
 
speeches in a big hall, which is st ill there. It™s
 a beautiful city. I star ted bec -- I became very 
conscious of ma  -- about my past, and who a m I.
 I ask question, Mama  -- in Polish then -- who 
are we?  We  Jewish, you say. Why don™t we go to
 pray?  Why the Polacks have churches, and 
they call us dirty Jew, why?  Always why. M-My
 mom said, ﬁI cannot an
swer you all this. They 
don™t like us and that™s all, because they claim we 
killed Jesus Christ.ﬂ I sa
y, ﬁBut that™s not true. 
He was Jewish.ﬂ And then there were the Ro
ma ns . You know, I know very well the history, and 
I just pushed them like this. 
Nobody can win with me . I said, ﬁI am who I a m and you are who 
you are.ﬂ You have to be human. And I found out th
at there is opening a Je
wish school, but it™s 
very far away from us, where we live. And I said
 to Mom, ﬁM ama, I™ m going to Jewish school.ﬂ 
She started [speaks foreign language here] ﬁWhe
r e  are you running? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI™m going to a 
Jewish school.ﬂ And while we going to a Jewish
 school, they will not cal
l us dirty Jew, and no 
anti-Semites, and I don™t want to see them. And besi
de, they going to feed us there. Food is very 

important. They going to give us lunch at school. 
What I did, like I am a organizer that they call 
me  always, commander, my friends, I™m a very organi
zer, so I said to my fr iends at the street, 
Jewish chi-children, ﬁYou know wha t?  Let™s go re
gister.ﬂ That was summerti me . We go to 
register to a Jewish school, a
nd it™s very far away, we have 
to take two tramways, there was 
electric s -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- streetcars, and then the communication of 
buses. It took like an hour 
to get each way. I got 
all my friends, my Jewi sh friends from this street
, from the other street, we went in the summer, 
we registered. And now is a prob
lem. The school starts. All of 
the children speak Russian, they 
came from Russia, different ages
, nobody knows to write or read Polish or Russian, and we s -- 
all speak rush -- Polish or Yiddish, and we speak Russian. It™s like [indecipherable]. So, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
77 
 
 
teachers were some of them older, some of them -- and they had a dilemma with different ages, 
how to place the children in classes, according to their brain and intelligence, everyt hing. They 

put older children, like 10 - 11, beca
use we™re -- I was in the first gr
ade. I was a big girl, and they 
were little kids. I was embarrassed. I was taller 
than them. I said, ﬁI™m not going to that class.ﬂ 
So what they did, very good thing, they gather a
ll the older children that 
they don™t belong to the 
first grade, 10 - 11 - 12 even, and we got into 
one class, it was intensive study, because we had 

background in Russian, we al
ready knew how to read. 
Q: Right. 

A: To study Yiddish and Polish. And it to -- th
ey call it a chong. Chong 
means to pull, you know, 
pull everybody out. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they call it the chong, and we studied fo
r a year, very intens
ely. I knew mathematic 
better than everybody because I was th
ere in third grade, in Russia. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I knew how to multiply and this, they didn't know how to put one and one together. So, I 

was good, and then we studied Polish and Yiddish
 to write alphabet and everything for a whole 
year. And then, according to ages, they placed us in 
different classes. I went to the fourth grade, 
so I didn™t lose too much. 

Q: Right. 

A: So I studied history, Jewish hist
ory, I still have -- it was then in
 Polish history [Polish] I have 
that book, the history of Jews. 

Q: Of Jews, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
78 
 
 
A: Yes. I have that book. I brought it with me  
always. And -- and we were very happy there. 
First of all, they gave us lunch in the Je
wish school. We  studied Russian, Polish, Yiddish, 
history, geography, whatever other gr -- inthe same  grade. Mathematics, and I knew 
ma the matics good because from Rus sia. And we were very ha ppy. 

Q: Did you sign up Mordechai as well? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So he went too?  W- With you?  

A: Of course. 

Q: Course.  

A: Mordechai was like glued to my hip. 

Q: But he couldn™t be in your class. 

A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: He was not. 
Q: Right. But that was okay. 

A: But he went -- he  was, accordingly to his age -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- he learned Yiddish 
and Polish [indecipherable] 
Q: So how did you get there, it
 was so far away?  By tram?  
A: By tram.  

Q: By tram.  

A: Two tramways we took, and you know, switched?  It
 took like an hour and a half to get each 
way, but we didn™t mi nd. We  walked home , back, if
 we wanted to save money to see a movie. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
79 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: Mama  couldn™t give us money to go see a mo vi
e. It was not that expensive, but for them it 
was, so we always sneaked in without money. 

Q: But you also told me  off ca me ra th
at you snuck into all sorts of things. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Opera -- 

A: Opera. 

Q: -- concerts -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- the theater. 

A: Yes. 

Q: For nothing. 

A: For nothing. 
Q: And how did that happen? 
A: I don™t know, I just looked at them, all the cashiers or whatever, people were standing in the 

door, and I was looking at them like w
ith some  expression like for longing. 
Q: Mm. 

A: So they knew me, I was comi ng all the time. 

Q: And they™d let you in. 

A: And the guy saw me  th -- th -- when they star
ted, he just made with the hand, a gesture with 
the hand like come  in. And I was happy. 

Q: That was great. 

A: And my mom used to say, you 
bring a bed and stay there -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
80 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- in the theater. 

Q: Right. 

A: I say, no I™m very happy. I used to go to concer
t, I used to go to Jewish organization. They 
taught us Hebrew, you know, the songs and dances. They want us to belong to kibbutz, but my 

mom didn't  let us go to ki bbutz because she said
 they will br ainwash you and all the children will 

go to Israel. I don™t want to lose you. I went 
through the war with you an
d Mordechai, you™re not 
going to a kibbutz. 

Q: Going away. Wa s your father po
litical  after the war?  Did he -- 
A: Yes and no. He still belonged to the Bund. 

Q: Mm. 

A: But he worked and he  got disi nterested because
 my father started to drink after Russia and he 

drank. 
Q: He kept drinking. 
A: Mm-h m. And my mo m 
had a hard life to hold us together
. Didn™t want to leave him and my 
father sometime got violent with me. 

Q: Really? 

A: Because I answered hi m, he beat me  up. He used -- 

Q: Often? Really?  

A: Not too often because I tried to
 learn not to get into his way. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: He used to come  home drunk, some ti me  went
 to sleep, didn™t bother with us. He was not 
interested what we do, how we learn, how we -- 
never. Only my mo m. And my sister was very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
81 
 
 
small, sickly, so my mom was working. I used to ta
ke her to the doctors to 
give her injections, to 
take care of her, to take her to a movie, for 
a matinee for children™s shows. She called me mama. 
Q: Right. 
A: When I was 14 - 15, she called me  ma ma . I sm
acked her. I was very angry, I say, Ruja -- 
Rosa in Polish, Ruja, I™m not your ma ma, I™m your
 sister, I™m your older 
sister. Don™t ever call 
me  ma ma . You e mbarrassing me . 

Q: Right. 

A: But wi -- I took her to a doctor, I say you™re 
going to get an injection, squeeze your hands like 
this if one hurts you too much. She listened.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I bathe her, we went to movies together, me
 and my brother. We  were always together.  
Q: Right. 

A: Always. 
Q: So your father -- I me an, your father
 changed a great deal after the war. 
A: Yes, yes. It -- 
Q: Do you think it was also fighting? Being in the army? 

A: Yes. Russia they were giving them -- he
 said, before they going to the -- fight. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They used to give them vodka to drink, in or
der not to get, you know, scary or whatever, they 
became alcoholics. So my father drank. But my 
mom started to control him. She say, you drink 
at home, I™ll prepare [indecipherable] you and you 
drink a little bit, like 
a small glass of vodka 
and don™t drink more, and that™s it. And 
tomorrow you™ll have another. That™s -- 
Q: And he did that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
82 
 
 
A: He did that, but some time he had money, he we
nt with friends and believe it or not, Jewish 
men from our streets. We, when we meet with my
 friends in Israel, my best friend Miriam, we 
joke about it, but we laughing with
 tears, that all of 
them were drunks. All the Jewish me n that 
came from army a fter the war were alcoholics. 
And you couldn™t help it. That™s how they were. 
In Israel, he  was not too much drinking, because 
it was hot, the climate was hot. He worked with 
a horse and buggy. He had to deliver goods to stores
 and this, so he dra
nk a little bit. My mo m 
prepared for him dinner, and he was sitting at 
home. There was no television in those days, in 
Kiryat Shimona we lived -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- on the border in Galilee on Golan Heights. 
And we saw the Katyushas running, the Russian 
Katyushas at us from Syria, ™67 -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- when there was a war, and I brought my father
 to burial from Haifa at
 this day, June fifth, 
1967, he died in the hospit -- 

Q: In ™67?  

A: Mm-hm. That the war started in Is
rael with Syria and Lebanon and Egypt. 
Q: So he died quite young. 

A: Yes. He was 66 and he had cancer.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. He died in Ramba m in Ha ifa. Very 
hard. He suffer e d. They lived in Kiryat Shimona, 
that was quite a way -- 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
83 
 
 
A: -- from Haifa, and -- and that was a stupid sy
stem, I still don™t understand. If you died in this 
hospital, and you live in a different
 city, you have to be buried according to the district of that 
city you lived. Unbelievable. Th
at™s a story I never forget. 
Q: Mm. 
A: Me and my cousin Luba took him out, the b
ody, from the hospital, it was six o™clock in the 

morning, June fifth, ™67. We  are going for an hour 
and a half, and all of a sudden there™s sirens, 
all over tanks and soldiers, Israe
li soldiers, heading the same dire
ction toward the Golan Heights. 
They stopped the van, and the ma n fr om Hevra Ka
disha, the religious ma n, wants to go home . 
He said, ﬁWhat -- what™s going on? ﬂ We heard in the radio, eight o™cl
ock that there is a war. That 
Egypt, Syria and Lebanon, and others attacked Is
rael. And the soldiers came, he say, ﬁ What are 
you doing here? ﬂ  I say, ﬁ Well, we bringing my father
 to burial.ﬂ He looked
 at the back, he see 
the body. I say, ﬁWhat can we do?  We -- he lived in
 Kiryat Shimona and that™s where he had to 

be buried.ﬂ So he says, ﬁOkay, you follow us, you co
me  in the mi ddle. We will protect the van.ﬂ 
The driver was a religious Jew with
 a beard. He says, ﬁI™m going b
ack.ﬂ I said to him in Hebrew, 
ﬁThis is [speaks Hebrew here]. You cannot le
ave a dead body unburied. You have to follow and 
bring him to rest. And beside the army is
 protecting us, you have nothing to fear.ﬂ 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I was a young woma n telling th
e religious ma n what to do. 
Q: Yes, you were 23, or 24?  23 years old, I guess. 

A: Oh, you know to count. 

Q: We ll, a little bit. It™s 24. I think we  have to stop the tape. 

A: Stop. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513

A: So I think that --

Beginning Ta pe Seven 
Q: Sarah, when did you start dating? 
A: Oh. 

Q: In Poland, you started dating, were you young? 

A: Of course, of course. I had 
a love of my life when I was 14. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. That was -- my parent
s and his parents were friends 
in Warsaw before the war. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: After the war, they met and they survived, th
e parents, and they lived in a small town in 
Poland after the war, and we lived in a big city, in Wr oclaw. 

Q: Right. 

A: Which was a Jewish population. Th
ey had Jewish theaters, Jewish club and Jewish library and 
school, everything. He was two years 
older than me , his name is --
 still is Joseph Holtzman. He 
was good looking, he doesn™t look ev
en Jewish. He had blonde hair
 and blue eyes, and very 
handsome a nd tall. At the beginningI didn™t like him when he used to come  to us because I was 

more cultured girl from a big city -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- going to theaters, behavi
ng nice, talking quiet. He came 
fr om this small town and 
[indecipherable] yelling, screami
ng, gesticulating with the hand
s, and this, running. And I was 
embarrassed to go out with him. The n -- he used 
to come , not too often in the summer, to stay 
with us with his father because hi s father and 
mother and my parents were the best  friend in 
Warsaw, Poland. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
86 
 
 
A: We  kind of grew up together, but I did not 
reme mber. Aft e r the war he used to come  to 
Wr oclaw, I used to take him to movi e, we went 
together. We  used to sit in the park and kiss and 
hug. And of course we didn™t do anything, we were
 very naïve children in
 those days. But he 
called me  my sweetheart, and my sunshine, and 
I was embarrassed to hear that, you know?  So -- 
Q: That was too open for you, or some thing? 
A: Too open -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- too open. I was very naïve. 

Q: Mm. 

A: I liked him, but I never showed that before. 
So one time in summertime , my father, me , went 
to thei r town, that -- called Jawor -- Jawor. It 
by train like two and a half
 hours from Wroclaw. 
They lived there in a beautiful apartment, there 
were a lot of green. It™s different, i -- like a 
country -- 
Q: Mm. 
A: -- place. And he had a lot of friends, Jewi
sh children, girls and boys. And we went swimming 
and I didn™t know how to swim, he
 s t arted to teach me  swi mmi ng. And then, in the evening we 
used to sing together, all boys a
nd girls and he called me  my dove. In Polish, it was golabek, like 
a white dove. 

Q: Yes. 

A: I was embarrassed. 

Q: It™s very sweet. 

A: But I was very shy then, and he say, oh, when 
we grow up, we get ma rried together. I say, we 
still have time  to think about it. And all the ti
me he used to come  to Wr oclaw when he had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
87 
 
 
vacation, and I finished sixth grade, eighth gr ad
e, you know. And he came to visit me . I took him 
around in Wroclaw to show theaters, movies, and 
we went to parks. We  were sitting, hugging 
and my mom always sent
 my sister with us. 
Q: She -- she was your chaperone? 
A: A chapero -- yes. And my sister was a bi
g mouth. A terrible gossiper. She was little. 
Q: She was very little.  

A: Yes. But he liked her, he used to put her on 
his knees, and he liked her, he carry her because 
she didn™t have too much strength to walk with us. 

Q: Right. 

A: And -- 

Q: What was she, three year
s old, or four years old? 
A: No, if I was 14, and she was 10 -- she was four or five, like this. 

Q: Yes, okay. 
A: Five. And she used to say, I don™t have streng
th to walk. She pulled out her hands. He picked 
her up, you know?  But she has a mi nd of a ma ybe t 
-- more than 10 year olds. When we came 
home -- 
Q: Yes? 

A: -- she used to tell my ne
ighbors and my mo m and dad -- 
Q: That you were kissing. 

A: -- that Joseph was kissing Sarah, and he -- 
and he was holding her and hugging her, and she 
didn't say anything. I used to beat her up. 

Q: Yeah? 

A: I™d say, I™m not going to take you anywhere with me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
88 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: Don™t tell anybody, th
is is embarrassing. 
Q: Right. 

A: He likes me , I like him, he is my boyfriend, but
 that™s it, we are friends. She used to tell 
everybody what -- we didn™t do anyt
hing, of course, in those da
ys there was no sex around or 
nothing, we were very innocent. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I was studying and he had a friend in Wr ocla
w, and -- a ma le friend and this fr iend had a 
sister, and they grabbed him, because the sist
er is -- was not so good looking, but they had 
money, or whatever. So the friend grabbed, and 
then her mother grabbed him in, you know, like 
a child, so he used to come , and I got very hurt.  

Q: Mm. 

A: I was very hurt, and I was very stubborn 
and I™m vicious. If some body hurts me , I will go 
away quietly without a scene, but never again see th
at person. He went to the army at the age 19. 
I was going out with other boys, I wa s performi ng in 
Jewish theater in Wr oclaw, and he wrote to 
me, my mo m read all the letters 
before me , of c ourse, she wa s very curious. You couldn™t teach 
her anything. And she say, why are you not talkin
g to -- why are you doing this?  He said he 
loves you, this -- I say no, ﬁHe hurt me , I don™t wa
nt anything to do with him.ﬂ And some ti me  
being stubborn, I still til today regret that. 

Q: Mm. 

A: But I did it my way. 

Q: Right. 

A: So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
89 
 
 
Q: So you never answer him?  
A: He lives in Brazil. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: He ma rried that girl that I know very well. 
We  went to Israel, I ma rried in 1957. I -- we went 
to Israel, I ha d my Isaac, and that was the end of 
the stor y, we worked hard in Israel. They had a 
store, a grocery store. We lived in Kiryat Sh
imona. But my he art always belonged there, and I 
was thinking there. And his wife once called, she came to New York in ™83 or some thing. And 

she called, she found some  friend that they knew where we are. We  received her, my husband 

and I went to Brooklyn to pick her up, her name  
is Marla. And I took two days off from work, I 
took her around to Manhattan, show her, she want ed shopping because she had already two 

children. One was studying to be a doctor, and she 
say, come to Brazil, to Rio de Janeiro, they 
have nice -- I say in the meanti me, I don™t know. 
And then my friend from Los Ange les came, 
and she™s going to Brazil with 
her husband, to Argentina and Br
azil. I gave them his telephone, 
their telephone, I said, ﬁCall up a
nd see if they wa nt to see yo
u, a friend of mi ne, you know, just 
say.ﬂ She did. And they me t her at the hotel 
where she stayed, and I got a beautiful letter 
[indecipherable] a gift from them -- from hi m, 
them. She brought it to me , I was wearing -- my 
husband didn't  know that™s a gift from her, we 
were like conspiracy between me  and Nina. And 
she say that cost 80 dollars, my husba nd gave her 
the money, she gave it to me  back. That was 
the first time I lied to my  husband. Maybe it™s 
not nice, but I didn™t wa
nt a scene or scandal 
because he was very jealous
 of him, he knew him. 
Q: Right. 

A: And whe n my husband passed away in ™86 
-- ™89 -- ™89, my husband passed away of lung 
cancer, he was 52 or three, I wrote a letter to them
, and pictures, and I would like to visit Brazil, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
90 
 
 
but I don™t know the -- and I heard 
that the woma n alone should not travel. The travel agent told 
me  about it. You should not go to Brazil, it™s ve
ry violent there. If you have some body, so go. I 
said, I will write, I have fr iends. I wr ote, I send pi
ctur e, I would like to -- I will st ay in a hotel, 
and I would like to meet you. There was no answer. I 
don™t know if he got th
e letter or not, there 
was never an answer. 
Q: So you didn™t go? 

A: Probably. And I didn™t write 
and didn™t call. I still have th
e telephone number in Rio de 
Janeiro. It™s written in my little
 book of telephones. I never called. I 
have my pride. And it™s late, 
you know?   

Q: Right. 

A: I™m a wi dow already 16 years. How long?  Seven -- 18. It will be 18 years. 

Q: That™s a long time. 

A: My husband died young, and -- 
Q: So, how long after you decided you weren't 
going to see this boy when you were 14 or 15, I 
don™t know when you stopped, did you meet 
your husband to be?  How did that -- 
A: I knew my husband before that, but we werenever friends. He had a different group of 
people. He was three years older,
 but he acted much older than 
me . I have my crowd of people, 
he didn™t study in the Jewish school, only in
 the beginning. I knew hi
s younger brother who was 
singing, my husband was playing piano, he was a st
udent, he was very talented ma n, musician, 
he played beautiful the piano, the accordion, but
 I never was in the same  company with him.  
Q: Oh. 

A: He actually was going around with non-Jewish
 girl, I used to m
eet him on the street 
some ti me , you know?  But he never paid attentio
n to me . The n, I was performi ng in Jewish

theater, and he probably saw me  on the stage, 
and one day in my house, it was a Sunday, I was

the door, my sister says, some man is  looking 
for you. And my mo m opened the door, yes [indeci

live?ﬂ This we never communicated. He say, ﬁI f
ound out and I would like to talk to you, ma ybe 

you want to go to a movie?ﬂ And my sist

Q: Yeah. 

A: She already sat on his lap and telling him 
stories, that I go out with this friend, I

A: Oh, ho, no. Til today, she te

Q: I see, right. 
A: I say okay, so we took her with us. Of course
 she was ma -- ou -- my c haperone, my sister 
always. 
Q: Right. 

A: If I didn™t know a boy, or ni

Q: It™s a good idea, sure. 

A: Yes. And we went to a park, he bought her 
ice cream, bought me  ice cream, and started -- and

Q: Wo w. 

A: I had to bury my son, and my husband. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I don™t want any more to ma rry nobody, not 
because I™m not interested. I just don™t want 
to be in pain again. I am meeti
ng with this ma n who is a Holocau
st survivor from Auschwitz. He 
has two daughters, one is ma rrie
d, one divorced, and his wife die
d. She was from Ri ga. And they 
are na -- my neighbors, I know them for a long 
time , belonged to the same synagogue, but he 
never paid attention to me , he 
never knew me . And we went at 
the Jewish organiza tion in New 
York, it™s called Hidden Children. There was a 
Ha nukkah party in December three years ago. 
And some  fr iend brought him over to our table.
 I looked up, I say, ﬁI know you, sir.ﬂ He  say, 

ﬁYou know me ? ﬂ  I say yes. You live on this and 
this street, you go to this synagogue where I 
belong, and my na me  is Sarah. Then he left. 
I didn™t give him my 
telephone, nothing, you know, 
no address. 

Q: Right. 

A: And three months later he called me  up. He 
found out from the synagogue that knows Sarah, 
who lives not far and they gave him tele
phone number. And well, we are good friends. 
Q: Right. 

A: We  travel together, we  go out
 things together. He is very 
good ma n, and I showed him how to 
live, where to go, he never traveled, only worked
, worked, worked. He™s an electrician, very 
efficient, very talented man, and good ma n. 

Q: Mm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0513  
94 
 
 
A: No grandchildren, so I said, my grandchildren 
will be, so my children invited us last year of 
Hanukkah. 
Q: Right. 

A: We  were there. And I™m happy. I have my
 children, grandchildren. My younger grandchild, 
18, Gabriel is going to college in Ohio. He was 
accepted to a good college , I forgot, and June is 

going to be his graduation, we™re going to go. A
nd June fifth is my son™s and daughter-in-law 
25
th
 anniversary, wedding anniversary. 
So we going to celebrate that. 
Q: So how do you put together this difficu
lt childhood, in a way no childhood. A childhood of 
trying to escape and not be murder
ed, with this person who enjoys lif
e a great deal, that it did not 
see to enf -- o-or is it mi xed up in some  way? 

A: It™s a good question and it™s ha rd to answer
, because it™s probably because of my attitude 
toward life. What I went through, all the hardship
s and suffering, I still have a thirst for life.  
Q: Mm. 
A: I enjoying life, I enjoy pe
ople, I am outspoken, outgoing, lovi
ng culture, reading a lot, and 
that™s why I™m looking forward for good things to
 happen. And bad things that happen to me  I 
reme mber. I don™t want to bury them. I reme mber 
the day of my son™s death, I put candles, and 
my husband™s Yortseit, the comme m oration of the 
dead, and what I went through, I cherish life, 
and I am still looking forward to be around and 
enjoy and travel and see people, me t people. 
Maybe of my curiosity of other people™s life, 
and I™m a very open-mi nded and curious person, so 
that™s why I am coping. It™s very
 hard. Some time at night I cry 
for no reason. There is reason, but 
all of a sudden I get moody, or whatever, I start 
crying by mys e lf, I cry alone. And after that, I 
think there is still life 
and still hope and good life ahead. And I 
want to enjoy my children™s life,

my son and my grandsons. See to their wedding
s and graduations, Bar Mitzvahs already went. 
So I™m looking forward to new things. 
Q: Do you think you got some  of this from your mother? 

A: Yeah. A lot.

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: My mo m was my best friend. We  both suffer our 
father™s decline and be
ing an alcoholic after 
the war. He was good man before, but he probably c
ouldn™t help it. My mother stood with him to 
the rest of her life.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And we too. We  spoke to my 
father, but he couldn™
t help it. I always protected my mom.  
Q: Mm. 
A: She died at 91. 
Q: Right. 

A: She lived a long life, very good. She rema rried, and my fa -- 

Q: Oh she did? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: At the beginning my sister and my brother 
were very skeptical a
bout it, and I said, Mom 
should not be alone. It™s good, he
 is a good ma n, he is a Polish
 Jew who [indecipherable] and 
very good children and grandchildren, good fa mily a
nd he loved my mother. He died -- he had 

heart problems, and they had a good life together. 
And she was living nice. And then my brother

order tickets and to stay in the Dead Sea for six da
ys with my  brother. My 
sister doesn™t want to 
see me . My little sister, Shoshana

the days that we were there 
for her. She was not good to my mom. She was not
 good to my brother, a
nd now she doesn™t talk 
to me . I don™t know why. 
Q: It™s di fficult. 
A: It™s very painful. I love them all. She ha

daughter with a child, and 
a son. And I happen to be a good friend with he
r ex-daughter-in-law and the mother of the 
daughter-in-law. They™re good friends from Israel 
and I -- a very intellig
ent girl. She rema rried 
after the di vorce, and I™m fr iends with them. Ni
ce ma n. And they have a little baby girl now. So 
it™s beautiful. I send them a gift with a card, an
d they call me Safta number three, grandmother 
number three, because they have two grandmothers. 

Q: Right. And you™re the third one. 

A: And I™m the third one and I™m very happy. He
