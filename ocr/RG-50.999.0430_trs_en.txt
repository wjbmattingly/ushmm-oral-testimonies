Gerry has been associated with this museum since bef ore it

Heinrich Mann.  In addition to his work translating for the Museum , Gerry spent 10 years 
translating works of the renowned Austrian psychiatrist Alf red Adlerthat had not been 
previously translated. Gerry and Vivian loved to sailand did sof orm any years.  Af ter they 
sold their boat several years ago

Gerry, you were born in 1925, before Hitler and the Nazis' rise to 
power.  Before we get into thebeginning of your odyssey leaving Ger m any, tellus about those 

early years, the years before

when you wer e a youngster,before the Nazis came to power,

about yourf am ily andyour com munity.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau: I grew up in sortof  a m iddle class, maybe lower m iddle class 
neighborhood. T he only thing it had that wasreally worth while living there was abeautif ul 
park.  Eventually I would go backto that.
 
 
My f ather changed hisjob.  Just cam e out of the Arm y.  He was 
a soldierforf our years for the Germ an Arm y. He received the highest awards for his work. He 
happened to be a heavy m achine gunner. And when I went into theArm y, I alsobecame a 
heavy m achine gunner.  I don't know how that ever f itstogether, but theremust be som e gene 
som ewhere. 
 
 
 
I grew up as a child, and I had a very early a nd happy early 
childhood. I went to public school.  My teacher was a ver y nice guy.   I remem berhim to this 
day.  Even know his nam e. T he name of one of ourfootball coaches some years ago. 
Howe ver that cam e together. 
 
 
I enjoyedm y schooling.  I was not a top student.  My father 
rem inded
 
m e of that whenI would show m y report cards, which I kept. There was interesting 
little inf orm ation Ihave there, testam ent, of whathappenedtom e over the years.
 
 
In 1936, the 
N u r em bu r g

to separate the German peoplef rom ever ybody else.  His idea was that Germanshave 
a pure blood,unlikeany other people.  Hepersuaded a number of people ofdoing that,that 
this was ok.  And since Jewish blood was notthe same asGermanblood
,  it wa s  im p o s s ib le 
fo r
 
Jews to have any 
--
 
impossiblefor Jews to have any contact with Germ ans.  Hem anagedto

m ake people believe this.  Iam surem ost of thepeople didn'tbelieve him. T hey sort of  went 
around with it because it was just too dangerous
 
to have your own i deas.
 
 
T his idea, in 19
30
 
--
 
and then these Nurem berg L
aws
,  
which 
were designed mostly to eliminate everyone else who's not German,they dictated what your 
lif e is going to be like.  Andamong those things were thata Jewishchild could no longer go to 
public school.
 
 
T hen in 1936, I hadtogo to a Jewish school. 
 
And you can 
im agine allof  a sudden, all of these kids coming to the sam e school. T here were few, not 
m any
,  
because notm any people wentto Jewi sh schools.  Allof  a sudden they were f looded 
with people who they never expected to get. It was not a comf ortable time.
 
 
In addition to that, lif e becam ea littlebitm ore tense. I know that 
because I looked back on m y report cards, and I got worse and worse marks. T he only way 

that canbeexplained is that the tension that I had athom e kindof  seeped intom
e , 
and I was 
also affectedby it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  If  you don'tm ind, let me take you backa little bit and ask youa coupleof other 
questions,before we get to that point. T ell us a littlebit about your mother.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:My m other was
 
--
 
yo u
 
want to hear the whole story?  My m other was 
born
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ido,actually. 
 

[Laughter]
 
>> Gerald Liebenau: 
T a llin n,  t
he capitalof  Estonia.  Her parents
 
--
 
they had m oney.  T hey had 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

a beautiful home.  In addition tothe house
,  
they li ved in the city. W e used to goand visit there 
because they had beautif ul beaches. It wasm y f irst exposure to really nice beach weather.  I 
becam eaffected by that f orthe rest ofm y lif e.
 
 
My m other began to study piano.  Eventually she studied
 
in  St. 
Petersburg, which was  sort of the cultural center of  Russia. W hen the revolution started, her 
m other told her to come hom e.
 
 
My f ather, who was in the Germ an Arm y, was stationedas an 
occupation soldier. He went to services at the synagogue.  At theend of services a man said, 
would you like to com e to m y homefor supper? W hich apparently was done in thosedays.  
My f atherdid,and saw that beautiful girl there who hefell in love wit h and eventually they were 
m arried. She at one point decided thatSt.Petersburg was not good enough. She wanted to 
go to Berlinbecause that's where m yf ather was.  So they got together in Berlin.T hey wer e 
m arried in 1922. T hey lived a ver y nice life together. T hey hada very nice lif e. 
 
 
My m other was also,because of herm usicalear, a genius at 
languages.  My father,who tried to learn English, never really could learn English.  My m other, 
on theother hand,picked itupas if  it were part of  her nature.
 
 
T o go backto where Iwas before, tension grew in m y f
am ily.   
And there are two ways I could tell this.  Onewas thef act thatm y f ather trying English, whi ch 
was a hopeless task. You couldnot tune in to any station that was nota German station. He 
hadto listen to aLondon station because it was the only
 
way he could hear any English, but 
thatdidn't help him  either.

It was a tense situation.  I knew som ething was happening in m y 
fam ily.  My m otherbecam e more agitated. W e had oneother outletwhich was quite im portant 
tom y f am ily.  My f ather was a sportsman. He was an athlete.  He rowed.  He was
 
a m ember 
of  a Jewish rowin g club.  There were several of  those in Berlin.T he club hada large
 
--
 
m os t  
im portant, it was located right on the river, the river that goes through Berlin. Learned to swim  
there 
and swam  therefor m any years until I learnedhow. 
 
 
It sohappens, this was long before they started cleaning rivers 
anddoing som ething about the environm ent. Right acrossf rom where we were swim m ing was 
a chem ical company.  I have no doubtthat they dum ped the chem icals into the same river i n 
which I was s wim m ing.  And if I lived a long life, andam fairly healthy, I imagine I was 
im munizedf orall of  these diseasesthat people go to the doctorfor to be immunized.
 
 
I noticed that the adults in that
 
c lu
b started talking about
 
how to 
get outof  Germany.  This was the subject taking on increasing im portance in the Jewish 
comm unity.
 
 
You m ight wonder why is it that the Jewish com munity didn't 
catchonearlier?  After all, Hitler cam e into power in 1933. He
 
let everybody know what his 
idea was.  He wrote abook, "
M y S
t r u ggl e
,
"  in which he told everybody, we're goin g to get rid of  
the Jews, get rid of  the Pols, allof  these
,  
he told people.
  
Butnobody believed him .  T
he 
Jewish com munity in Berlin felt very saf e. T hey f elt saf e because they li ved therefor so long.  

T hef irst Jew to come to Berlin was in 1712 or something like that, on the records, walked into 
Berlin. T hey've al wa ys been there.T hey've alwa ys been part of thecomm unity, part of

so cie t y.   Th
ey were part of  the governm ent.T hey had senior governm entoff icials who were 
Jewish.  T hey couldn'tbelieve that som ebody would actually do something with all of  these 
clever peopleand all of this knit com munity that Germ any was that they would listen t
o a guy 
like Adolph Hitler. And yet, they did. 
 
 
Adolph Hitler had onesecret.  He had probably the best 
propagandam achine anybody ever had invented. Many others came af ter along with him . 

Soviets did som e sim ilar things.  But theGerm ans were unique i
n 
m aking it a science. What 
they had to say aboutJews, their blood, their physical stature.  Upstairs, thetopf loor where 

you begin your tour, you'll see doctorsm easuring kids' headsbecause they could tell a Jew 
f r om  th e  s i ze  of  h i s  hea
d and how the bones were 
structured. That's how m uch they 
penetrated the science and the culture of theGerm an people.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Gerry, you m entionedthat there were Jews in the government.  You 
witnessed an incident at the justice. W ill youtell us about that?
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:Yes.  Thank you. T hepark that was across the street fromm y building
 
--
 
I lived in anapartm ent block. T he entire block was practically one building, one right next to 
theother,f our storieshigh orf ive, and we had an apartment way at the top.  My playing 
ground was thepark. T hat's where I went. Ididn'thave to gofar, across the street into the 
park. W eplayed the gam es Germ an kids played, Cowboys and 
I
ndians.  That's all the 
Germ an kids wanted to play. T o this day, yo u have
 C
owboy and Indian clubs in Berlin that 
people actually dress in exactly the sam e kind of  clothing thattheywore when there was real 
Cowboys and 
I
ndians in the wild west.  It'san enorm ous industry, this cowboy business.

Oneday we were playi ng.  All of
 
a sudden there was a lot of 
people gathered inf ront of a courthouse, a
 
huge courthouse, at the endof  thepark. All of  
these people were com ing together, which not usually happened. As kids, we wanted tosee 
what was going on. W e went over thereandsaw af ter a while that the whole place was lined 
by storm  troopers. Storm  troopers were the active gu ys who were actually charged with 
m aking sureeverybody stays in line.
 
 
T he doors open.  A whole lot of m en indark suits and brief cases 
in their hands walked out of the building.  I went by these Nazi storm troopers. T hen I knew 
som ething was up. Because it turnedoutthey were all Jews.  And it was the beginning of  the 
segregation of the Jews of alm ost everything that was going on in Germ any.  It was par
t of th e  
Nurem berg 
L
aws.  Germ an Jews, Jewish children couldno longer play with non
-Je wish  
children.  Jewish doctors lost their license to practice.  Germ an doctors were not allowed to 
treat Jews.  It was one of  thosethings that covered ever ything, including eventually that Jews 
no longer couldusethe public transportationsystem .
 
 
T here was other increasing pressure on the Jewish com munity.  
So thistalk thatI saw in the club m yf ather took us to alm ost every weekend in the sum mer 
was beginning to make
 
sense tom e.  As a young boy of 12 years, Iknew m ore or less what 
was going on.
 
 
T he businessabout leaving Germ any was alm ost im possible. It 
couldhave beendoneearlier in the Nazi period bef ore they got them selves organized.  But by 

the tim e people b
eg
antof eel what was going on intheir lives, they were no longer able to get 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

out.
 
 
T o com e to the UnitedStates,for exam ple, you had to have 
som ebody in the United States vouch in a little document known asan affidavit that you would 
not only becom e a 
charge of the U.S. governm ent, that you never will be needing helpf rom  the 
U.S. governm ent. And for som ebody todothat with two kids, a husband, wif e, that's quitea 

big job totake on.
 
 
I was lucky.  M y m other, who was a typical Germ an housewif e, 
only 
job was to play the piano
 
--
 
and she practiced allday long, I think.  She supervised the 
m aids, the cooks. She m ade sure everything was going f ine whenmy f ather was out.
 
 
He, by the way, by this tim e became a textile m erchant, a
 
new 
job he learnedbecause he couldn'tbelieve that anybody could work as a window decorator in 

thehot summer or the cold winter.  It was nota jobfor an old man. 
 
 
So  m y
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T his is when your m other, I think, began to thinkabout relatives in the United 
S ta te s.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:Yes.  Thank you.  Sometim es it slides 
of f .
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:My m other, she hadno real responsibilities
,  
but all of a sudden she 
began to realize that she hadanuncle, herfather's brother, who
 
was somewhere in the United 
States.  Shehad no idea where he was or whathis nam e was.  Becausehis name didn'tsit 
well, so he musthavechangedhis name. She wrote a letter to herfather with whom  she was 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
in contactand said, 
B
y the way, what is your brother'snam eand where does he live?  Andas 
luck would have it
,  
heknew who it was.  The guy was now nam ed Morris Miller
,  
and he was 
living in Scranton, Pennsyl vania, where hehad abusiness.  As luckwould have it, he alsohad 
a son who just graduated from law school.
 
 
So the affidavit was som ething that he coulddo.  My m other 
wrote a very appealing letter. She could do that. She couldm ake tears comeout of  your 
eyes.  She told him 
ﬁP
lease save us,
ﬂ 
because there was noother way we could ever leave
 
Germ any without their help. 
 
 
Sure enough, he did send anaff idavit.  Andm y m other, who 
was al ways sort of a leader when 
it
 
came to talking wit
h people, took 
it
 
to the U.S. E
m b a s sy.   
T he  
attaché
 
who was in charge looked at theaff idavit and said
: T
h a t' s  
not good enough.  Why 
isn't it goodenough?  W ell, he has hisbusiness.  Can'tm ake thatm uch money in that 

business. T he business was secondhand clothing store on LackawannaAvenue. T hat was 
about as low as you could get.  Notm uch money was being m ade 
there.  But
,  
obviously
,  
he 
hadenoughm oney tosendhis boy to law school. But that was notsatisf ying the council.
 
 
At that tim ethe U.S. governm ent, the U.S. State Departm ent
,  
was notf avorably in vi ew of the Jews.  T hey didn't liketo see Jews com e into the United 

States.  Andthere was a lot of pressureonthese people who were issuing theexit perm its, 
actually the visas,f or people to come to the 
S
tates, to give the Jewis h 
people as hard a time 
as they could.
 
 
By this tim e you'retalking 1938. W e're getting close to theend

of  any departure f rom  Germ any.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Gerry, I think you told me at the rowing club when they would start
 
--
 
t he  
conversation turned tom igration, because the U.S. was so diff icult to get to,that they were 
talking about destinations like Argentina, China, places like that. 
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:T here were ver y f ew countr
ie s
 
that actually had an open em igration 
policy.  China was one of  thefew countries that did.  And, yes, there was a Jewish com munity 
in Shanghai,of  which there was anexhibit in this building, how they m aintained their identity 
andeventually m any ofthe Chinese cam e tothe UnitedStates.  Many of the Jews who li ve in 
China, survi ved in China, came to the United States.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fortunately
,  
because yourmotherhad the relative,you were able to get that 
aff idavit.  But as you were saying, it wasn't good enough.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:  My f ather, who still has this idea thatthe Nazis were looking only f or 

m en, he couldn't conceive of the idea that wom en and children would also be included inthis 
beginning of  taking
 
--
 
[Inaudible].
 
 
In thistextile business, hehad customers in England. The 
m anuf acturing of  certain cottons were done in England.  Hehad high
-
quality m aterial.  And I 
guess becauseGermany neededforeign currency, they were able to take a business trip, 

which was lim ited in tim e, several m onths.  Allowed to go toEngland and purchase these 
te xtile s so  tha tm o
ney would startf lowing into Germany, which you would have to give up in 
Germ any for marks.  My f ather had no intention of  getting backto Germ any, knowing f ull well 

he no longerhad a chance to survive in Berlin.

T hat leftm y m other and her two children
 
t o t ak e  c a r e of  
ever ything thathad tobe done, to leave ahom eand move somewhere else.  Except she 
couldn't go anywhere else, except she alsohad this idea if  she could persuade s
om ebody in 
the American Em bassy that all she wanted to do was visit her husband andthe children, that 

som ebody m ight allow.
 
 
Luckily we're talking about hum an beings
,  
because they're all 
different. Som epeople meld together.  Others will do whatever they can to helpotherpeople.  
T his tim e she saw somebody who actually let her have a visa for us to visit my f ather. I'm  sure 
they knew 
--
 
knew exa ctly what we were doing.  But in this case them an apparently was 
conscious of  the plight that m y f am ily was in. 
 
 
Some tim ebefore that
, 
the Nazis cam e looking f or m y fam ily.  
And this is an interesting story because it tells you a lotaboutpeople. T he Gestapo people, 

two of them  who cam e into the house,the building, f irst went to the custodian. The custodian 
alwa ys had a little room  on thef irstf loor where you come in, checked everybody out when you 
walked through. They stoppedand said where was thefam ily.  Andshe said, without 
hesitation, "T
hey're not thereanym ore.  T hey left."  And since it was fourf lights up, they 
decided it's not worth going to. So they didn't.  If  they
 
had com eupstairs, they would have 
found us.  Not m yf ather, but m y mother, sister, andm e. So it was interesting, Germans 
housing people. There were several of them ,probably m any of  them who would have done 
differently f rom  what the Nazis asked them  todo. But they had no choiceeither.

a sense to pay a transportation com pany tom ove ourfurnituref rom  Berlin toScranton, 
Pennsylvania.  Hepaid for it. Gota receipt. And totally unexpected, one day a hugem oving 
truck with thesemassive
 
containers, used toship things in, pulled up atm y apartm entbuilding 
and started taking our furniture out to be shipp
ed to Scranton, Pennsylvania, which tells you, 
again, that's not what the Nazis wanted you to do. T hey wanted totake that stuff and ta
k e  it  
som ewhereelse and sell it to somebody so the Nazis couldm ake more money or whatever  
they wanted to do.  But this worked.  He waspaid. He hada job todo.  He did it.

young Polish man living in Paris who 
had
, 
obviously

somem ental problem s became angry becausehisfam ily, in Germ any
 
--
 
all 
Poland was sent into concentration cam p.  He shot aGerman Foreign Service Off icer.  He was
 
caught. There was a lot of to
-
dom ade about it, but the Nazis tookthatact as a starting point 
for theirown f inal solution. They beganburning down every s ynago gue they could 
a
nd
 
e ve r y 
synagogue that was not next to abuilding close enough to start af ire.
 
 
T he synagogue that I attended, m yf am ily attended, it 
wa s  
com pleted building in 1930.  1938 it was burned. It started again with a caretakerf or the 
building who calledup the rabbi and said
, O
ur synagogue is burning.  The rabbi, who was

we l l

known, a ver y talented and very gif ted speaker, rushed to the scene.  He senta letter to 
m y f am ily m any years af ter this telling him this story exactl y as I'm telling it to you now. T he 
le tte r 
is now in this museum.  He said," I came toa scene, and there were thesefiremen 
hosing down all the buildings in theneighborhoodtobe sure that they don't catchf ire while the 

Nazis kept stoking the firethat made surethe building woul
d burn."   I saw that building i
n 1946.  
I went toBerlin.  I was stationed in Vienna, and I went to Berlin.  I visited the site of the 

synagogue.  Sureenough
,  
it was burned down.  Ever ything that could burn burned in that 
building.  It was an imm ense building.  It was la
r ge r
 
--
 
it could accom modatem ore people than 
this room  has. It was a majestic building.  And there it was.
 
 
But you know what?  Ever y single building in thatentire 
neighborhood was bom bed to pieces. There m ust have been af light going over that street 
and lef ta stick of bomb on every building.  Som ehow all these businessestrying to save their 
buildings didn't quite work.
 
>> Bill Benson:  On that nightof  
November
 9-
10, Kristallnacht, Night of  theBroken Glass,for 
yo u
,  
I think you told me that you were com ing hom e or som ewhereand you saw an art store 
thatm attered to you, and that was destroyed
, 
and that's when you realized what was going on.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:Yeah.  I was not therewhen the synagogue was onf ire. ButI went to 
school that day because nobody knew what was going on anyhow.  But suddenly I came to the 
corner of the building of the street I lived on and a large art supply store had been totally 
sm ashed. T he windows were broken. All thethings that Iused to look at
, 
because I really 
liked those things, liked the paper,the pens,all the crayons, all theparaphernalia that goes

with m aking pictures. And I saw thatbuilding totally
,  
the store, destroyed.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jewish
-
owned business.
 
>> G e r a l
d Liebenau: Jewish
-
o wned business. T hat was only oneof thousands of businesses 
that were destroyed.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So soon after that
, 
you started to tellus you then were able to get to England.  
T ell us what happened to you
, 
how you got out of Germ any and what happened when you 
crossed theborder into the Netherlands.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:W hen you got to the train station
 
--
 
we did get on.  Ourtickets were 
good.  Again, som ehow this was m y f ather'sbusiness as well to see that we get tickets. My 
mo
ther andm y sister and I were already thinking we' ve m ade it. W e're on the train. Thetrain 
is m oving in the right direction. But suddenly at the Dutch border the train stopped. Everyo ne 

was told to getout.  Atthatpoint m y mother lost it.  Shehad all the courage and knew exactly 
what to do at all times, really thought this wastheend.  And she could have thoughtthat way.  
W hyelse would they take us all off the train?  They put us into a hotel.  I never shallf orgetthat 
night.  Ihad totell m y m other to please calm  down, never m ind m y sister.  It was a moment I 
hadto grow up all of a sudden.
 
 
T he next day, withoutany explanation, we were told to get back 
on the train and continued into Holland. W ecam e toEngland.  My fatherhad a sm all 
apartm
en t
,  
a very sm all apartm ent.  Apparently it wasn't big enough to accomm odate allf our of  
us, soI was selected to be handed over to anotherf am ily, a very O rthodoxed Jewish fam ily
,  
andI was notanOrthodox Jew, but I knew enough to say I'll m ake ago.  They were wonderful

people.  They took m e in.  T hey treat
ed
 
me
 
lik e  t he ir s o n
.  
And above all, they said, you
 
k n o w 
what, you have tobecom e barm itzvahed because you'returning 13 years old. At that po
in t, 
ever y Jewish boy has to be b
a r 
m
itzvahed orhe does
n't becom e an adult or som ething like 
th a t.  
Sure enough, asit turns out
,  
if Ihad wanted to come
 
--
 
they said they don't know how to 
do that in the United States. You can't trust it.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:
  
If they had only known how m uch they saved my lif e.  Ididn't have to 
learn whole portionsof the 
B
ible. I didn'thave to have abig party.  My parents must have 
been glad. Butthey were very, ver y decentpeople.  I guess this isan aside.  T he Jewish 
co
mm unity in Berlin was very self
-
contained.  They thought they we re thebest. 
 
 
Letm etell you about the Jewish com munity.  Som etim e in 1931, 
the Jewish com munity felt som ething had to be doneto let the Nazis know that the Jews in 
Germ any were an im portan
t part of the society,
 
that
 
they hadm oney, they were well
-
educated, 
they had big nam es.  Af ter all, Einstein was in Berlin.  You really shouldn't throw all of  these 

people. They're too good. They're too im portant. 
 
 
So this book
 
here 
--
 
t h is  is  lik e  a  t
elephone book 
--
 h
as the nam e 
of  every Jewish household,and it gives the address. I don'tthink
 
itgi ves the telephone 
number.  T
heir address. T hey gave this book outto let people know not only how m any 
people were in Germ any
 
--
 
rem em ber, it's difficult to come by.  But by 1938, they said there 
m ay have been160,000 Jews in Berlin.
 
>> Bill Benson:  All listed there.

>> Gerald Liebenau:  Hm m?
 
>> Bill Benson:  All listed there.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:T his was given out to ever ybody who had access to it.  I 
am  sure this 
m usthave helped theGestapo greatly tof ind all the Jews.  It was like a guidebook of how to 
f ind Jews in Berlin. Little did they know putting this
 
--
 
but it shows yo u they had nofear. They 
were not concerned about their lif e.T hey wer e sure that their lif e in Berlin was as saf e as 

anywhere in the world. 
 
 
Let m e put this book up. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Gerry, you were in England.And then eventually, of course, you wouldm ake 

it to the UnitedStates.  How were they able to m ake thathappen? 
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:T his is kind of amurky chapter inm y history.  My parents now actually 

hadtwo aff idavits.  The secondaff idavit was f rom af riend of Morris Miller, m y uncle.  And this 
was by a Jewish fellow who was not related to us, whoowned movie
 
theaters.  Movie theaters, 
you could get20people in. They were all over town.  All you saw was cowboy movies.  I 

guess this affidavit also was written by m y cousin, the lawyer.  Andwhen my mother took that 
to Berlin, he also said
, 
ﬁT
h i s  i s  no t  go od  en
ough because he's nota blood relative.
ﬂ
  
So twi ce 
he turned them down.
 
 
W hen they got to England, they now had two aff i
d a vi t s .   T hey 
we n t to  the  U.S . E
m bassy.  M y m other did this again.  I tell you, withoutm y m other, I don't 
think we would bealive today.  Shem usthave talked the guy into believing these two aff idavits 
are excellent.

And,again,hum an beings are not
 
all the same. T his guy said, 
ﬁS
ure, f ine.
ﬂ
  
And we got our visas, and soonwe were on our way to  the 
S

W e were traveling on a shi

-
st a cke r,  loo ks e xa ct ly like  
theT itanic.  Nothing happened. W ehad to be in the lowest class,third class, whatever itwas, 
wa y down in the bottom .  But we were treated well, f ed well.  It was all very nice.  And one 
day
 
--
 
we couldn't go anywhere.  It was not like today when you're on a cruise, you go 
ever ywhere you want to go. There were ver y restrictedplace
s 
that people f rom  birth there 
could go to. But you could alwa ys go
 
--
 
back in the boat there was lots of space. People could 
wa lk.  I 
usedto go there.  One day I saw a kid aboutm y age, nicely dressed, suitand tie. 

People dressedup when
 
they traveled anywhere at that tim e. T here was no sport clothesor 
sneakers.
 
 
So I wentup to him and I said, 
ﬁW
heredo you live?

I had 
learned by this time a little English because Iwas going to school inLondonfor a month or

>> Bill Benson:  One thing I'd like you 
to  
share with us before we talk about
 
--
 
a l
it t le  b it of  tim e  
we have lef t 
--
 
about when you got tothe United
 
States.  Yourfather had beena very avid 
stamp collector.  Andthose stam psactually became really im portant to your journey.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:W ell, it was thef irst clandestinedoperation I ever sa w.  I was not a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

21
 
participant in that.  My father was a great stam p collector. He knew stamps. He knew what 
k in d
s 
were valuable. He had them.  He wasfairly m eticulous in putting these stamps intoa 
collection.  His books looked perfect. Every s tamp was covered.  Every stamp was perfectly 

put in.  Hehopedhe could takethis stamp collection and take it with himoutside andthensell 
it  in  t he  
S
tatesandm aybe have somem oney.  But Germ ans wouldn't let him
 
--
 
you couldn't 
keepanything.  So hedecided he'd sm uggle som e of those stampsout. He hada cousin
, a  

relative of som e sort, who was a m anuf acturer of  album s. And these albumshad thick covers.  
You couldopen theback of  itand put things in there.  He put a good part of his collection into 
these album sand glued it back together andsent itas a package to af riend of his in Mexico.  
It worked. W hen we got back to the 
S
tates, he got the stamps back.  I'm not surethat he sold 
m uch.  He kept collecting stamps. And collectors don't sell. They're collectors. They don't 

sell.  But I guess it didhelp
 
in afew instances.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas your f irst clandestinedoperation.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you arrived in the UnitedStates.  Oneof  thethings I wanted you to tellus 
about, you'renow in the United States and they put you in the second grade.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau: In thosedays they hadno use of Englishforf oreign speakers,this sort of  

thing. T hey putm e in the second grade. I was 13 years old.  I was yay tall.  I swear to thisday 
they putm e in the secondbecausethef irst grade didn'thave a chair big enoughfor me. So I

psychological sort of  infusion whenI was in Germ any.  I justhad to get out of there. I didf ine. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You ended up being class valedictorian
, d
idn't you? 
 
>> Gerald Liebenau: I was one of the class speakers.  My accent was horrible.  But Idid talk 
about patriotism andfighting.  Becauseas soon as I gotoutof high school, I was in the Arm y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had m etVivian by this tim e, in high school. You were supposed to
 
go t o  
your high school prom , r

>> Gerald Liebenau:T his isa terrible story. 
 

[Laughter]
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:Yes.  I did meetm y wif e,m y f uture wif e.  By this tim e we m oved to 
N

London, Connecticut. New London, Connecticut, is a wonderf ul city.  They have beaches.  
T hey have all the summ er entertainment you would ever want. W ewere very happy in 
Am erica.  And that's where Imetm y girlf riend.  It was on the beach. I went tothe beach.  
T here was this gaggle of girls.  I believed they m ust have pulled straws as to who's going to 
get this guy com ing down.  Andm y wif e won.  That was in theArm y. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You can talk som em ore.  I'll let you know when you can't.
 
>> Gerald Liebenau:People who want jobs, listen to this. W hen I was in the Arm y, I was a 

heavy m achine gunner.  T hey sent me to Italy
, a  
littlebit northof  Naples.  It was a terribletim e.  
T hey gave us unif orm s and clothingfor hot Italian weather. It was cold.  It was them iddle of 

winter.
  
I've never been so cold in m y life.  And all we did was takeour heavy m achine guns

and walk upand down into little villages.  I was getting ver y tired of  that. 
 
And one day 
som ebody told me, 
ﬁY
ou're going tohave to report to somebody in Naples.
ﬂ
  
So  I
 
said, 
ﬁS
ure.
ﬂ
  
I put on aunif orm
.  I
n thosedays every soldier had a unif orm.  Not justf or keeps. I repor
t  to  
this guy.  He said tome, 
ﬁW
ould you like to jum p out of  airplanes
 a
nd kill Germans behind the 
lin e s ?
ﬂ
  
I thought f or a m inute.  
I was told that them achine gunner could live about10 seconds 
bef ore
 
everybody kills him . I said
,  ﬁI
t  
m ust take longer than10 seconds to jum poutof an 
airplane.
"
  
I never hadeven been in an airplane. The ideaof  jum ping out of it was totally 
absurd.  But what should I do? I said yes.  
 
 
T he next thing I knew, I was
 
--
 
I li ved in atent. T he tent had 
cots.  It was cold,drafty, and awfully uncomfortable. So when I got to thisnew outf it whichI 
just joined, I was taken to a villa.  I was on the seashore.  Had it
s own beach, had m aids and 
cooks. I said, I'm  dead and I'm in paradise. That's how we got into the OSS.  Didn't tell me 

what it was until I had enough clearances tobe told where I was.  And I was actually going to 
be sent with a team  toAustria.
 
 
T hose 
of  you who saw "
The G
lorious 
B
astards,"  thatf ilm  depicts 
the team  that cam eout of m y unit. W ehad the sam e comm anding off icer.  I was going to do 
exactly the samem ission. But I since learned these m issions are rarely s
u cce ssf u l,  
and the 
head of that team  was ver y successful.  He was an outstanding soldier
, a
 
wonderful operator.  
He did save the city. He simply talked the mayor into letting the city go as an open city.  By 
t h is  t ime
,  
Patton was very close to Austria
,  
and that helped. It was an am azing stunt. So Iwas 
ready tof ight. It was one of thosethings where theoperation succeeded beyond belief .

>> Gerald Liebenau: I was too busy being a soldier.  Ihad really novision of m y past.  I 

becam e an American in a m inute,
 
a second,whatever it took. 
 
 
T he whole idea of why we're here today, that there was
 
a 
horrible thing going onin Germany, thatm illions of  Jews were being killed in cam ps, that was 
notnormal.  Infact,m ost peoplenever even talkedabout it.  Ihad som e
 
inkling of  that when I 
was stationed in Vienna with the OSS.T he war was over.  I couldn't go onmy mission.  So 

they took 
me
 
toAustria in a jeep.  It was very nice. T he Austrians were justas happy to see us 
as they were when Hitler came into Austria.
  
T hey couldn't benicer.  And I really had toom uch

som ething happened about which they knew nothing.  I was aware of  it because in Vienna 
there were Jews who had been rescuedby va riousf orces, U.S.forces, who came back to 
V
ienna. There was a service at Passover.  Iwent there
 
--
 
well, we had lots off ood in ourplace 
anda lot of  liquor. So I took som e with me, took it to them . That was thefirst tim e I met 

people who actually had gonethroughthis. And they were still looking like they had never 
com e out. They were haggard, old, sick.  It was a real revelation that this was the lef tover of  
the Jewish com munity of  Germ any.  Austria.

s a w t h
ese Germ an kids in uniform , blackpants, brown shirts, leather belts, marching down the 
street. I was jealous.  I felt thatthey had something Inever could get.  But I was also aware of  

thefact that these were pretty rough kids.  Fighting startedbetwee

you see, oneof  the 
things that Hitler was able to do was to makethe Comm unist regim e thealternative to history.  

He said to the Germ an people, 
Y

they knew nothing about Nazis, they sure
 
knew about socialism  andComm unism . And that 
was a fearm ostGermans had.  One of the things, tactics, he usedto put him self  intoan

Gerald Liebenau:W hat is it I can learnf rom this?  My only thought is that we do have the 
best system in the world. W ehave a constitution thatprotects us. It's up to us now tom ake 
sure that we are aware of the f reedom s and those whichm ight im pede 
us.  T he Germ ans were 
not.T hey saw their rights being taken away.  T hey didn'thave the gum ptionto stand up. They 
were m isled terribly.  Wehave totake a lessonf rom  that.  It happened in Germ any.  It was the 
m osteducated,m ost advanced nation, among
 
the mostadvanced nations in the world.  If  it 
can happenthere, could it happenhere?  Hopef ully not.
