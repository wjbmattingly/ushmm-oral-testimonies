biography of  today's guest, Mr.
 
MartinW eiss, as well as other materials to explore related to 
this history.
 
 
T od a y we  will lis t e n
 
a s  Ma rt i n

Ma rt y
,  
as we aff ectionately call him here
 
--
 
a s  Ma rt y 
shares his story with us for about 45 m inutes.  Af ter that we'll have an opportunity for you in the 
audience to ask questions. But before I invite Marty on the stage to join me, we've prepared a 
b rie f  s lid e
show to orient youf or the conversation. 
 
 
As muchas the story ofthe Holocaust is history writ large, it is the story of  individual 
experiences. Today we're going to talk about one boy caughtup in this history.
  
Here we have 
a picture of  MartyW eiss in 1946, the year af ter his liberation.
 
 
Marty was born in thecountry of  Czechoslovakia ina town called Polana
 i
n 1929.  
T here's Czechoslovakia on the map. 
 
 
In 1939, Germ any occupied one half  of Czechoslovakia and Hungary occupied the 
o
therhalf . Af ter the Germ an invasion of theSoviet Union in 1941,conditions inPolana 
worsened.  By 1944,the arrow here indicatesa town of  Munkacs
.  
Ma rt in ' s  f am ily wa s  
transportedtoa ghetto in the nearby town of Munkacs.
 
 
In May, they were deported 
to the Auschwitz
-
Birkenau killing center where Marty and 
otherfam ily m em berswere chosenfor slave labor. Later Marty andhisf ather were senttothe 

Mauthausen concentration cam p in Austria. This is a photographof  rocks that were taken out 
of  t he  qu a r
ry by sla ve laborersat the Mauthausen camp.
 
 
Showing you here adocum ent that was uncovered only recently in our archives and 
which was new to Marty even though the docum entdescribeshim as a prisoner. T his 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

docum ent is a Prisoner Registration Card which
 
ref lects Marty's transfer f rom Auschwitz on  
Ma y
 
21, 1944,to the Mauthausen camp.  Hisprisoner number appears in the upper right
-
hand 
corner where that redcircle has appeared, along with the abbreviation U
ng
-
Jude, which is the 
abbreviation for Hungarian
 
Jew.  His name isin the upper right
-
hand corner if  you can see it 
along with his birthdayand otherf am ily inf ormation.
 
 
So with that background in m ind, we are very,  ver y pleasedtohaveMarty with us 
today andfor his willin gness to talk.  Marty, I'd like to ask you to join m e, please,on stage.
 
 
[Applause]
 
 
I'd like to beginby m entioning that Marty hasbeen a volunteerhereat themuseum  
for, what, around 13 years?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Something like that.
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  And Marty and his beloved late wif e Joan, whom  we're missing very 

m uch, had two children and four grandchildren. 
 
 
Let's begin with your own youth, Marty.  As Im entioned, you were born in Polana, in 
Czechoslovakia.  Tell us a little about your fam ily, please,and lif e in your hometo
wn .  
 
>> MartinW eiss:  My youth, when I was younger, actually, we
 
--
 
C ze choslovakia was a 
democracy.  By the time I was like 7,8 yearsold, I remember we we re ver y proud to be a 
democracy.  Now, thereasoneven at that young age itm ade an impactonm e, I
 
had older 
siblings.  T here were nine:  
f
o u r gi rl s
 
--
 
f ive gir ls andfourboys.  I was num ber seven.  So I 
re a lly
 
--
 
when you have older siblings, you sort of  look up, seeking the word through them .
 
 
Oneof  the reasons I rem em bered we considered ourselves ver y luck y, lif e was 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

looking good, we hadhigh hopesf orthef uture and soon.W e weref or the firsttim e hoping to 
go to higher education and so on, which before it was alm ost non
-
existent. 
 
 
Our neighbors
 
--
 
Poland was next door to us.  They didn'thave
 
the dictatorshi
p at the 
tim e. Hungary was a feudal
 
system , though it wasn't a bad country at the tim e. Oddly enough
,  
they had a good am ount of Jews living in Hungar y.  Andm ost of thetim e,I'm always surpri sed 

to thisday, that people don't realize if you wer e Jewish, if you lived
 
--
 
whatever country you 
live d  in
 
--
 
like the Germ ans, the Jews in Germ any or Hungary, we were very lo yal citizens. W e 
were reall y ver y proud.  In Germany, the Germ an Jews were extre m ely loyal citizens
 a
nd the 
sam e thing with Hungary.  T hey would insist speaking Hungarian and soon.  Yet, yet, because 

of  prejudice,they always had problem s. T here were problem s all the time.
 
 
Now, we were luck y, li ke I say, because it was a democracy already. W ef elt more 
f r ee  an d  so  on .  W hen
 
the war came around,all things changed.  My brother was li ving in the 
city already.  T hey wen t to lookfor work.  My sister was going to school, to college inthe city.  

Not too many people,by the way, at that time ranaway f rom hom eto school
; a
n oddit
y.   V e r y 
few peopledid. She was the only one that went to collegef rom town
 w
hether it was boysor 
girls .
 
 
Anyway.  So we had this tasteof  theoutside. Plus we were ver y luc ky
.  W
e had a 
summ er resort in our town
; a
 
real nice one,too. It was owned by
 
one of m yf ather'sf riends.  
W eattracteda lotof people. T hey cam ef rom  all over because we hadthe mineral baths. So 

this man that owned it really built up a nice
 
--
 
it was som ething eventoday he would beproud 
of .  So a lot of  people from  Hungary, f rom different places.

1937, 1938, especially 
‚
38, Hitler startedm aking a lotof  noise aboutgoing to war.  
Andeverybody knew a lready thathe was going to go to war. W e were hoping that things are 
not going to bethat way, aren't going to happen. Soeverybody just couldnot believe it.  I 
rem em ber even though I was young, what I rem ember, are mostof us could not believe that it 
could happen.
 
 
W hen Hitler started, the f irst thing he did, he took part of Czechoslovakia
 
--
 
n o w, I 
alwa ys had a problem  wit
h this because thiswas a very well
 
--
 
h o w 
can 
I put it
 
--
 
e c on om ic a lly,  
it was one of the bestparts of the country.  Most of the populationthere were Germ an. But 

they lived in Czechoslovakia.  It was a democracy, so they had theirown schools. They 
tr
eated them  like everybody else.
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  Meaning
 t
hey were ethnically Germ an.
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Right.  Hitler startedm aking a lot of noise.  He wanted totake partof  
Czechoslovakia.  They said,oh, yeah, we are German
;  
we want to 
belong to Ge
rma ny.  H i t l e r 
s a id
 
they're Germ an
;  
they belong us.  So he just took it.
 
 
Andby the way, not toget intopolitics, but Cham berlain, theprim e minister of England 
at that tim e, literally signedaway C zechoslovakia, gave it tohim asa present. Af ter that,
 
guess what
.  O
nce he took thathedecidedhe wants the whole country.  So he tookthe whole 
country. T hey were no m atch to him  because he was well
-
arm ed.  He had a big Arm y wher e 
the Czechs were well
-
arm ed but they were not big
; a
 
sm a l l  co u nt r y.  
 
 
Mo s t  o
f  th e  time
 
--
 
I would like to stress before I gofurther that Germ any or Hitler 
didn'tdoeverything on his own.  Nom atter how strong they were, they couldn't have done it on 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

their own. T hey had alot of allies.  Andm any tim es in history, I hate to say it, even while we 
a re  s t ill livin g,  h is t o r y a lwa ys  
le t s
 
th e m off 
s
c ot
-
f ree.  I'll nam e you a couple
:  
Hungary on top of  
the list, Romania, Bulgaria
, C
roatia.  You could go down the line. W ithout them, he could have 
never achieved what he did.  
 
 
W hat wa s  
sadder still is whatever country they occupied,they had 
lots of  people, 
whether it wasW estern or Eastern countries
 
--
 
like today you hearabout the Ukrainea lot. He 
hada lot of  collaborators in those countr
ie s
 
that joined the Nazis.  Most of the time 
people 
don'ttalk about this.  But m ore than that theallies, Hungary was one of  them
 
--
 
I ' ll ju s t  s t ic k t o  
thatfor a while.  They occupied our area in 1939, March 1939.  So it was much before the 

Am ericans known thewar as 
‚
41. W e were occupied already in 1939. 
 
 
Atf irst, we knew already we were in big trouble because they were  part of the Nazis 
organization.  So we knew.  By the way, theHungarians were well
-
known to be very 
anti
-
S em it ic
, l
ike  I sa y
, b
ut they're Jewish citizens. They were ver y p roud to be Hungarian.  
T hey still are, som eof  them .
 
 
Anyway, I alwa ys hada problem with thatbecause if a country doesn't treat me well, I 
don'tthinkI would be so proud.
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  How did lif e changef or yourf am ily after 
H
ungary? 
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
  
F i ne
.  C
hangedf irst slowly.   You learn to condition yourself .W hathappened 
is for thef irst year or so we were getting used tothem or they were getting usedto us also.
 
By 1940 they mobilized.  W hat they did is they took in thism ost of the young men
 
into the 
Arm y.  They were f ighting along the Germ ansagainst the Russians.

Howe ver, the Jewishm en what they did, they inductedthem  into the service f rom 20 
years old to45.T heywere kept in civilian clothes
u
nder Arm y jurisdiction.  They called the
m 
labor battalions. In English translation it comes out to labor battalions.  In Hungarian, you 
would not understand. 
 
 
Anyway, once they we re drafted in, they were  under m ilitary rule. T hey used them  as 
slave labor.  Andby labor I m ean
 
--
 
by the way, them ountains, a lot of  forests.  And the 
forests,believe it or not, go through Poland,Ukraine, and Russia.  Ever ything is f orests
; a
 
lo t  
of m ountains, hills, and forests.  So they usedthem  to cutdown, believe it or not,
 
the  tree s, a ll 
the trees in
 
t h e 
f orests.  And everybody was com plaining about it becausethey were 
destroying nature.  But they did it so thatpartisans couldn't hide in theforest.
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  And your older brotherswere f orced into theseslave camps.
 
>> Ma rt i n  W ei s s :   My t wo  o
lder brothers immediately drafted into it
;  
r i gh t
, l
ike all the young 
people.
  
I don't want to spend too m uch timeon this, butm y brothers endedupon the Russian 
f ron t.  
 
 
By the way, it was hell on earth.T hat was the worst place tobeevenf or a German
 
soldier, 
t he
 
worst place to be. Sofor them itwas m uch worse.  And they were right behind the 
lines. W hat they were using them for was f orm inef ields,bury the dead and so on. And som e 
places they were cutting down f orests and soon.  
 
 
I of ten wondered why they didn'tescape.  They were not lockedup like in the 
concentration cam p, locked up underelectricbarb wire and so on
, c
onstantly under guard. 
No t .
  
I'll tell you the reason
 s
ome of  you may never have heard.  They worked up a system that 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
9
 
i f  so m
eone escapedf rom the com pany, thef irst thing they did
, 
they lined them  up the next 
m orning and just tookevery 10thperson andthey shotthem . 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: Take your time. This isnoteasy to talk about. 
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Obviously that's enough toputanend toanybody.  But more thanthat
,  
we  
were al ways ver y observant.  Like today most of  the Jewish people, like myself, are not very 
observant
 
bu
tat thattim e we were observant. 
 
 
W hat happened inoursystem of  learning, the f irstthing you learn isto preserve lif e.
 
>> Edna Friedberg: They didn't want to be responsiblefor som eone else losing his life
, o
f 
course. 
 
>> MartinW eiss: T hat m eantthey couldn'tbe responsiblefor som eoneelse's lif e so therefore 
they didn't.
 
 
Anyway, I don't want to waste too muchtim e on this. But just to give you an idea how 
lif e shapes. As it turned out, they were on the Russianf rontall the years.  I had onebrother
;  
he was theref or a very long tim e.  Heeventually got over to the Russian side.  And guess 

w
hat.  He got over tothe Russian side
;  
f or whatever reason the Russian accusedhim of being 
a Germ an spy.  So guess what they did. T hey put him  in theprison with all theother Germ an 

prisoners. W edidn't know he was alive
 e
ven af ter we cam e back f rom  th
e cam ps. T wo years 
af ter the war they released him .  He was in the coalm ines in Asia and Russiaf or all that tim e.
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  He was lost to yourfam ily all those years.
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Right.  Finally we f indout that he was released two years after the war. 
 

At any rate, eventually we got the Czech Republic
 
--
 
I'm not going to go into thedetails, but he 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
f inally m ade it to the Czech Republic where Ihada brother still.  Hesettled theref ora while.  
T henaf terthat he em igrated out of the c
ountry.
 
 
T he point I want to show you is ever ybody's lif e is a little different.  But getting back to 
our area, about thefam ily, we lived under Hungarians
 
--
 
actually, by and large we were getting 
by.  T he only thing that they did was take away all the Jewish businesses.  T hey took away the 

license.  You couldn't be inbusiness.  
 
 
Some places they threw you outof  thehouse.  Som e off icial wanted your house, they 
took your house. T hat doesn't happentoo of ten, toom uch, in ourarea,but it didhappen.  I
 
hadanuncle, he was very sick at the tim e, and they actually took away all his property, his 

house, andhehad to get out.  He didn't evenhave a place to live.  This is what they did.They 
did whatever theyf elt like. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  Letm e interrupt youa second to ask. W hatdid your father do before the 

war?  And then duringthis period, how was he supporting his wif e, all of these kids?
 
>> MartinW eiss: W ewere very luck y, m y f am ily, because m yf ather hada business.  Hewas 

in the meatbusiness.  W e also hadfarm land.  So we used tof arm  our own land. And thatwas 
a big, big thing, especially during the war.
  
Now, we wereraised 
as soon as 
we were big 
enough, you know, we helped on thefarm .W e cutthe hay, all kinds
 
--
 
potatoes, wheat, just
 
about everything.  Soeven during the war we were lucky, we hadall that we needed.
 
 
Just to give you
 
--
 
couldn'tf ind a barof  soap. My m otherf igured out how to make 
soap.  My f ather was in the meat business.Used thefat to make soap
.  S
o it  ju s t  sh o
ws yo u .   
But we were fortunate.

11
 
 
By that tim e there was already a shortage. And I'll tell youhow m uch of  a shortage 
there was lateron in the war.  In the spring ofthe year, I rememberwe plantedpotatoes
, 
s
eedlingsf orpotatoes.  And peasant
s 
used to c
ome in thenight anddug up the potatoes. And 
I remember saying
:  O
h m y God
.  W
hat kindof  thieves?  How could they be like this? I was so 
innocent so naive, I guess.  How couldthey do this? W ell, they needed something to eat.So 
they dug up the potatoes.  At the tim e I didn't see it that way, I have to adm it. 
 
 
In the comm unity, we got alongf ine.  By thewa y, all our neighbors, m ost of the 
comm unity f rom  town, were Russian. T herewere 40 Jewish fam ilies. T here was m aybe, like, 
2,400 people in thetown or whatever. W e got along. W e never had any problem s. W e did 
business with them .  In fact,many of  them  used to com etom y father for advice or help orm y 
uncles. So we hadnoproblem  asfar as getting along.
 
 
W hen the Hungarianscam e in,all of a sudden a lot of peoplethat had all of  a sudden 
hatred in them
,  
all of  asudden joined in and they were doing the sam ething.
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  Your neighbors?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Yeah.  Some of them
;  
notm any.  Butby and large we got along.
 
 
As time progressed, we kept on hearing stories about all kindsof atrocities in this 
Poland and Ukraine especially and so on. W e kept on hearing the atrocities.  They were s o 
gross, so terrible, that I rem em ber m yf ather discussing it with his f riends. W e would hear
 
a ll  o f 
these stories.W e know they're true, buthow could we believe theGerm ans could be likethis?
 
 
And I m ightadd, Germany was ahead in justabout
 
--
 
they were ahead in science, 
m edicine, literature, ahead in music. They we re ver y proud of that.How could they possibly 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
be suchm urderers?  And this is what we hada problem toprocess.
 
>> Edna Friedberg: W ere you hearing aboutm ass shootings?
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Mass shootings. W e kepton hearing
 
--
 
you go upstairs, you'll f ind out they 
had what they 
calledEinzatsgruppen, killing squads. T he Germ ansadvanced into Russia.  
T hey were going through all of  those countries like Ukraine andall of those countries.  
W herever they went, as they advanced, they hadEinzatsgruppenf ollowin g them and they 
would 
just go and pickup all the Jews in thearea.  Didn't matter if  there were five f am ilies in 
the town, one
;  
itdidn'tm ake adiff erence if  itwas 20,000. T hey wo uld pick them  up, takethem  
to the woodsand just shoot them . T hey woul d dig m ass graves.
 
 
B y 
the way, they had to do it them selves.  And inm ost cases whatthey would do
 
--
 
m ind you, this isEastern Europe during the winters
; c
old weather. Believe m e,Eastern 
Europe could be very t erribly cold.  Even where we li ved it was ver y cold.  Andthey wou
ld  

have them undress. W e camef rom  a culture where am an didn't even see his wif e get 
undressed inf ront of him , especially childrenwould never see theirm other, like in the United 
States, undressor som ething like this. Andthose men,espe
c ia lly a  lo t  
of  the older m en, 
O
rthodox, ver y observant.  Even today if yougo to
 
a Jewish area where there are O
rthodox 
people, they don't even lookata wom an. T hey go like this. T hey don't shakehands,nothing.  
 
T hey have to getundressed and march to their death. Then they wouldm ow them  down with 
m achine guns in themass shootings.
 
 
I'm  just showing you that how could an educator, so
-
called leaders of the world, have 
a population that could do this? Ordinary people
 b
ecam eextraordinary m urderers. This is

noth
ing this day I couldn't understand it.
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  I'm  going to interruptf or a second tom ake sure everyone understand
s 
the 
paradox.  SincetheW eiss fam ily was li ving u nder Hungarian ruleand Hungary was an ally of  
Nazi Germ any, paradoxicall y you
 
were shelteredf rom  som e of thisworst atrocitiesf or several 
years.
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Several years.  For a while.  LikeI say
 
--
 
by the way, f rom  other countries, 
like f rom  Germany
 
--
 
by the way, a country nobody ever talks about, Slovakia. T hey were p
a rt  
of  Czechoslovakia.  Right?  Slovakia joinedthe Nazis im mediately as soon as Hitler stepped 
into Czechoslovakia.  Slovakia was so cooperative they not only joined the Nazis
 
--
 
our section 
was taken by Hungary
, 
Czechoslovakia, the Czech part, taken by Germ any.  Slovakia joined 
the Nazis with suchf ervor that they were thefirst ones to ship out allthe Jews f rom  Slovakia.
 
 
By the way, like 90% of them never came back.  Ok? 
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  So to get back to yourfam ily's story
, o
n 
M
arch 19,1944, Ger
many 
invaded Hungary, its ally.
 
>> MartinW eiss: 1939.
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  Right, but they invadedHungary.  And then your lif e changed in your part 

in  
‚

ever y so of ten we heard rumors that they wer e going to pickus up and ship us out, too.  
Already now, af terhearing those rum ors
 
--
 
not rumors, all the information, we f iguredour tim e 
is  c o m in g.
  
Every so often there was a rumor, whatever you want tocall it, that they were going 
to pickus up ina month or next week or whatever.  It passed.
 
 
Finally, one day, by 1944, it was late in the war
 
--
 
by the way, by that tim e the 
Germ ans were losing the war.  That we knew. T he Russians were already pushing back.  
W hat t he y d i d  i s  t hey cam e o ut
 
--
 
it was like an Easter.  One day they announcedeverybody 
should be ready tobe
 
pickedup. The Hungarian police came inthe next day, everybody up.  I 
hadanuncle, he hadT.B., was in a sanitarium . They pickedhim up by the stretcher.  He 
would have diedanyway.  Nobody was lef t behind. W ehad noplace to go. We didn'thave 
the 
m eans. It wasn't like in the UnitedStates you could goto work and get on a train.  Under 
the Nazis whether it was Hungary or Germ any you couldn'tm ove wi thout being checkedfor 

papers and soon.  You couldn't go anyplace.  Of  course, if you didn't have 
the m oney
 
--
 
som etimes if  you had them oney, you couldbribe som ebody or something.  But if  youdidn't 

have all the means and all of this stuff , but there was no place to run. We were sitting ducks.
 
 
So cam e next morning.  W e packed ourbags. T hey took usto a ghetto.  Andfromthe 
ghetto we were therea ver y short tim e withoutf ood, without anything. W e were in a brick 
factory.  Literally, if it was raining, we laid in the m
ud
. 
 
You have to remember, we were all ci vilians.  Ever ybody had had lots of  sma
ll 
children because we had fam ilies. InEurope, people hadfam ilies between three and12 
children. Sothere wer e lotsof  babies
, 
a  lot  of  sm a ll k id s.

Now we were preparedf or anything because of  the stories we heard. W e were there 
a shorttime.  Oneday the train 
c am e 
up withthe cattle cars.  They put usonthe train.T he 
tim e I went, there were 125 
of 
them  in aboxcar.  Som e of them had25 to 135people inthe 
boxcar.  They had several trains running aday.  And I rem ember the trains were like 100, 1
20 
boxcars on the train.  
 
 
So ask yourself
,  
how coulda locom otive pull that?  A locom otive in thef ront andback.  
T he reason I
 
know that
 
notbecause som ebody told m e. W hen we wentaround a bend, there 
was a little crack open in the door and we wer e able to see the end of the train.  So we saw the 
locomotive f rom the back.  That's why I know.
 
 
Anyway.  By the wa y, the Hungarians did 
su ch
 
a good job
 
--
 
it wasn't the Germ ans 
doing it. T wo months they shipped out 450,000 people. Think of the logistics
: 
 4
50,000 
people
.  N
ot only thatbut there was only one railroad going through our area to Poland
, t
o 
Auschwitz.  T hey tiedup them ain rail lines with us, with the Jews to Auschwitz, insteadof  
carryin g m aterial for the Russian f ront f or the troops.  Ok?  I could never understand that 
either. I wish somebody could explain it tome. 
 
 
Anyway, we got to Auschwitz.  In our case 
i t  wa s  a
round m idnight.  T he m inute the 
train stopped, thedoors opened up and there were big flood
ligh t s lik e in  a ba llpark
 s
urroundin
g 
our perim eter.  It was not abig perim eter. They were surrounding us with these lights. They 

were shouting, "Schnell!
  
S c h ne ll! "  
 G
et out
!  Ge
t out,fast. T here were guys in striped 
unif orm s, theprisoner uniform s, with sticks like broom sticks, threatening you to hit you and all 

of  t ha t .  W e found  ou t  
later they were kapos and the
y 
were other prisoners except they hadto 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

16
 
do this job.  If they didn't do it, they were in trouble.  So they scaredever ybody.
 
 
So we got onthe ground.  And before you know it, there were soldiers surrounding us 
with rif les, literally their f inger on thetrigger.  Not only that but they had some nasty, nasty 
police dogs, really nasty ones. T hey were growl ing.  T hey were like you never saw.  T hey 
would tear anything apart.  T hat's how nasty they were.
 
 
Here we are, motherswith children, sisters, ever ybody was holding on to eachother 
not to lose som ebodybecause the crowd was big.  Before you know it, they had us separated, 
m enf rom  the wom en. In short order, we have tom arch
 
through

there 
was an off icer standing in shiny boots,beautiful outf its, clean. 
H

that.  If  you wentto the right, you went to work.  If  you went to the lef t, you went to your death. 
Very sim ple.
  
Of
 
course, we didn't know all of that. T he rum or was thatbecausepeople that 
would work, that would pay for the wom en and children and so on. W ehad no way
 
--
 
there 
was no choice.  You were hoping, ok, it was so. 
  
 
 
Because we knew they were going to ask
 
usgo to work

I was not ver y big actually.  
T o show you I was notver y big

all m y f riends diedf irstnight in Auschwit z and Ididn't.  Ok?  
T here were anotherf ive boys. T hey were aboutm y height andm y size that made it. But 

actually, technically, they were a year older than I was
.  S
o I was the youngest one that 
survi ved f rom  the whole town.

Because Ihadm y f ather, m y brother, Ihad abig brother. I went with them

And I passed.  Now, Ididn't know it at the time, but that was

two sisters. T hey went to the gas chambers 
im mediately.  Howe ver , I had some cousins
.  T
here were seven children.  Ok? T wo of them  
survi ved.  They were m y age, actually.  Oneof  them ended up working in a crematorium . 

Eventually he was killed as well.  Only oneof them  survived. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: W as your father with you also? 
 
>> MartinW eiss:  My father
 
--
 
anyway, once we were separated, men 
from  the women,picked 
for work, we were sitting
 
--
 
we were standing in ahuddle. And the wom en were separate.  
T hen there was a group not f ar, just a short distance, a very short distance, em pty space. I 

noticed m y mother and m y two younger sisters.  So
 
decided
 
--
 
I told m y f ather
:  Y
ou know 
som ething, I'm  going to go and run across that space, join them
.  B
ecause this way
 
--
 
I  wa s  
older, I'll be able to gatherf oodor som ething.  It would bem uch easierfor them. 
 
 
My f ather saidok.  So I tried to make
 
a runf or it. W ell, guess what.Oneof  those 
guys in the striped uniform s, very nasty, grabbeda hold of any 
neck
, the back of m y shirt, back 
o f  m y n
eck, threw m eback.  He says, " You can't go there,"  threaten
ed m e
 
with  stick.  I we n t 
back to m yf ather 
and com plained.  
 
 
Guess what. Af ter we went through the showers, got the unif orm s, they took 
away 
clothes, wooden shoes and soon, came to the barracks.  By that time it was dawn.  And then I 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
18
 
found out what happened to the otherpeople.  And I realized that man savedm e
, s
aved my 
lif e . 
 
So that was m y introduction into Auschwitz. 
  
 
 
T here's always an elem ent of luck in life.  I didn't stay in Auschwitz too long.  I was 
thereonly a week or 10 days. W e were toldwe were going on a transport
.  S
o t he y b r o
ught 
our boxcars. W e
 
--
 
even thoughthis tim eonly 50 people inthe boxcar. W e have to sit 
cro ss-
legged.  By thewa y
,  
two guards.  I don't know why they needed guards. W e were 
locked in anywa y.  But we were not allowed to talk,m ove. W e weresitting li
ke Indian f ashion
, 
o
ur legs crossed. W ewere not allowed to move anything.  I don't rem ember what we didfor a 
bathroom .  DidI tell you?  I don't rem em ber. I just don't remember that part at all.
 
 
Anyway, we got on the train. W e went
 
--
 
this tim e we f i
nd out we're going westward.  
Each tim e the train stopped, som ebody f igured now they're going tokill us
, e
ach time.
 
 
By the way, when we cam e tothe barracks
 
--
 
If orgot to tell you. W hen we came to 
thebarracks after the showers, thef irstthingwe saw,
 
not far, afew hundred yards away, it 
was a row of  pine threes.  Andunder the pine treesthere was a big f ire.  I'm talking like the 
size of  a f ootball f ield.  Ok?  T he width of  a football f ield
, b
igf lam es. Thef lames were so high 
they were going up to
 
the height of the trees.  W etried to makeout what it was.
 
 
In the m eantim e
 
--
 
by the way this was Auschwitz.  It was dawn. W e saw thesebig 
chim neys, f ive or six chim neys going straight  up very high, like industrial chim neys
, b
la ck 
sm oke spewing out. And the one thing I'll tellyou, if there's such a thing as hell thism usthave 
been

if an artist hadto paint hell, he couldn't have done any better.  It was very dingy,

black smoke, was rising.  Thesef ires under the trees were going.  W e were like, didn't know 
what to makeof  it.
  
O ne  of  t h e 
kapos that was therealready told us
:  S
ee thosef ires?  Your 
fam ilies are right there now.
 
 
W hat happened, the crem atorium s couldn'thandle the volum e. T he 
H
ungarians 
shipped out, likeI say
,  
in two m onths,450,000 people. T hey were k illing 10,000to12,000 
people daily.  Of course, we didn't know that then. T he Holocaustdoes research and wef ind 
these things out.
 
 
W hat
 
really gets m e about it
t
his was done byordinary, so
-
called ordinary, people.  
Andby the way, in thecrem atorium s, who do
 
yo u
 
think thepeople were helping the Germ ans 
that were part of it? Li
thuanians, Latvians, Ukrainians
, younam e it. All the count
r
ie s
 
tha t 
Germ ans occupied were willing helpers.  Of  course after the war they were all victim s.  Butthe 
pointI'm trying to say, you f ind inevery populationthat people are capable of doing it
, 
u
nf ortunately.
 
 
So we got onthe train.  W e were going westward.  T he train stopped on the Danube.
  
>> Edna Friedberg:  Danube 
R
i ve r .
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Right.  By the way, Viennanotfar off. W e were able to see the city.  Even I 
could recognize it f rom picturesprobably, wh atever.
 
 
T he train stopped at the water. W e heardall kinds of storiesabout them throw
i n g 
people into the 
r
ive r,  Uk
raine and so on. W ef igured:  Aha,they're going to throw us into the 
ri ver. W etried to reason.  If  they did that, they couldn't have bring us here.T hey could have

there. So you argue with yourself .

Anyway, we went a little farther. W e came

the train stoppedalongside of thishuge 
m ountain.  It turned out to bea stone quarry, but it was ahugem ountain. They disem barked, 
m archedup them ountain. W e came to the top of them ountain.  Itwas a big cam p.  It was 
called Mauthausen.
 
 
It turnedout Mauthausen was also a very, ver y
 
--
 
if  you get on the internet, you'll read 
up on itand see whatI'm  talking about. They didn't kill outright in gas chambers. T hey ki
lle d  
yo u
 
--
 
they hada system . They worked it out.  Again, wef indthis outf rom the Museum. They 
killed you with attrition
, b
y work ing you so to death and notfeeding you.  You only had a 
certain am ount of  lifespan.  Ok?  So this was their program.  And
 
it worked.  Because people 
did not survive too long in Mauthausen or any
 
--
 
b y the way, Mauthausen had lots of  sub
 
cam ps.
  
W e were told there were 40 sub
 
camps, but the Museum  foundout later,the last 
couple of  years, therewas som ething like
 
80 to 100. 
 
T h is  is  ju s t  in  
Austria.
 
 
Anyway, Mauthausen was
 
--
 
m ost of  thepeople that stayed in Mauthausen,they 
worked in the quarry.  By the way, Mauthausen was built alloutof  stone.  Like the gates, the 
wa lls
 l
ooked like like if you look in them ovie 1500England or som ething
; th
e b ig,  t h ic k  wa lls .   
T hat's how Mauthausen was built.  Alldone by the slave labor.
 
 
One thing I will tell you about Mauthausen
 
--
 
and sofar I was talking about Jews.  
Right?  Once we cam e to Mauthausen, Mauthausen had a variety of peo
ple, nationalities.  
T hey hadpeople,even Germans.T hey hadGerm ans. They had Pols, lotsof Pols, lotsof  
Ukrainians, lots of  Russians, Russian POW .
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  As prisoners.

>> Ma rt in W eis s :   Righ t
.  S
o we were processed in Mauthausen. Then we
 
were shipped off  
im mediately to a working camp. T he cam p Iwent to was Melk.  Now, Melk was a sm all cam p.  
It was about 12,000, 13,000 population. T hework was very, ver y hard also. 
 
 
I stress Mauthausen
 
--
 
by the way, we were al l considered political p
risoners.  W e all 
hadm arkings. W ehad markings wh y you were there.  Most people at Mauthausen,the 
Mauthausen cam ps, were considered political.  However, there were a lotof Germans, like 
prisoners, sentenced 15, 20 yearsf orm urder, robbery, rape, whatever.  So they were there 
also. T hey were usually the kapos because they were rough.  If  you live in prison 15 years, 
you're tough. So they turned out to be the kapos. The kapo inm y barrack was one of those.  
W hen Ifoundout he was am urderer, I said
: 
O
h m y gosh. But youknow something?  Made it 
m y businessnever toface him . I always avoi dedhim .  Actually turned outnottobe so bad in 

hindsight com paredto other kapos who were m uch worse.
 
 
Anyway, we went to work. W e worked inbuilding tunnels. I can't go into details 
because of tim e. In less than a year we hada populationof  12,000, 13,000
.  W
e built seven 
tunnels.  Andthe reason they need the tunnels, they wanted to putall the factories 

underground becausethe allies were bombing them .  
 
 S
o we were under constant
 
--
 
by the way, we worked with cem ent, gravel. W e hadto 
lit e ra lly m i x it  wit h  a  
pail of  water, alm ost like in a house, your own yard. W edidn't have any 
m odern equipment or anything. W e worked with dynam ite. W e had to blast into the ground

you thought about

So Hungary
 
--
 
I foundout this, too, came through the Museum .W ehadno ideaof  
calories. W e lived between 300and 700
-
calories a day.  Hard labor.  Plus we had to march in 
all kinds of weather to andf rom work.  I remem ber we were so tire
d that I rem em ber literally 

falling asleep walking.
 
 
Anyway, I'm  not goingto go into detail but toshow you how in lif e som etimes you're 
lucky.  I was actually lucky m ore thanonce. W hile I was workin g in the tunnel,on thenight 
sh ift, Ih ad  to go  to th
ebathroom .  So I cam eoutof  the tunnel. I went to the latrine.  I came 
back af ew m inutes later and there was this big black sm oke com ing outof  thetunnel
, r
ea l  
heavy black sm oke. Turned out a cable
 
--
 
they have those big cables
, l
it e ra lly t h is  t h ic k
,  
c
aught onf ire. Inafew m inutes the whole tunnel gotblack. Only thing in the tunnel was we 

had light,naked light bulbs, sm all light bulbs. That's theonly light they had inthere. T he 
sm oke, you couldn'teven see the light bulb. Literally within m
inutes 65 or 70 people died just 
in our own tunnel in that one tunnel. And I happened to be outside.  By the tim eI cam e back, 

it was over.  T his was like afew m inutes later.  Shows you how sometim es you can be lucky.
 
 
Again, because of time I'm  not going to go into too muchdetail, butanother tim e it 
happened,I worked again anight shif t.  Mostof  the people in the cam p
 
--
 
they had, like, Arm y 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

23
 
barracks, individualbarracks.  I lived in whatyou call, m ight say, headquarters buildings.  It 
was m ade out 
of  concreteand stone. The kitchen, som e warehouses
 
--
 
sleeping quarters 
were on top.  It was made literally
 
--
 
I think bef ore that it was usedfor amm unition depotf rom  
what I was told.
 
 
Anyway, we were
 
--
 
the building was long.  So 600 on one side and6
00 on the other 
side.  Onem orning, again with luck, they needed somebody tof ill acertain
 
--
 
they called it 
comm andos, working group
.  I
n this case it was maybe 20 people or whatever they needed 

som ebody.  Regardless if you worked thenight bef oreor whatever, they didn't care. They just 
grabbed you, you go
.  A
nd they grabbed me. Even I went to this com mando group. T his
 
wa s  
thenicest job Ihad in all thetim e I was there.  I went about two, threem ilesf rom  the camp.  

T hey had to cleanup the grass.  It was spring.  T he twigs and stuff.  It was the nicest jobIhad.  
T hat was like apromotion.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
So I rem ember, it came lunchtime. W ebroke for lunch.  It was so nice.  I remember it 
was sunny.  T he grass was green. W e laiddown on the grass. 
 
I mean
 
it wa s  lik e
:  M
y God.
 
So while we were doing this, all of a sudden thesebom bers cam e,English bom bers came in.  
T hey honed right on the building,our barrack.  They dropped 15bom bson that building
, o
n 
one side of the building, actually.  Because
 
very strong.  It was m ade out of what they call
 
--
 
they had a special nam e for it. It was built with iron cem ent
, 
so they had a special nam e for it.  
I can't remember exactly
 
in Germ an what it was.  Anyway, it was a very, very strong building.
 
600 people

Ok?  I was not there.So, you see thesethings just happened byf luke, God, whoever. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg: W hen you were in Mauthausen, were any otherm em bers of yourfam ily
 
with you? 
 
>> Ma rt in W eis s :   Ye s .  A c t ua lly
,  
when I came to Mauthausen, it was m y father and Ihad a 
couple of uncles.  One uncleandm yf ather were in the camp I was in.  However, we didn't see 
eachother toom uchbecause we haddiff erent work shif ts.  Besides, I was onone side of the 
cam p. T hey were on the other side of the cam p.
  
Occasionally we were lucky enough that we 
were able to f ind each other, otherwise we never knew
 
--
 
we hadnowa y of  connecting toeach 
other.  T hen one day I found out m y fat
her had died.  He had pneumonia. He died. My uncle 
did survive.  And another uncle came to Mauthausen with us but went to adiff erent camp.
 
 
It just so happen
, 
in this camp also I hada cousin
; a
ctually two cousins
,  
two brothers.  
Oneof  them  the work was too hardf or. He died there.  Hisbrotherwas lucky.  He was an 

orderly f or the kapo.  He was m y cousin. W ewere there together inthe same barrack.
 
Now we had to be evacuated because the Russians were closing inf rom  Hungary.  The 

H
ungarians were pushing in to Austria. 
 
 
And guess what the Hungarians were doing. Insteadof  releasing the labor battalions, 
guess what they were doing. T hey were taking this testim ony with them.  T hey brought them  
into Austria andputthem  intoa concentration cam p with 
u s. 
 
Now it just so happened when it cam e

when they evacuatedus,they tookus back 
to Mauthausen.  Andf rom  Mauthausen they sendus on af orced march, now they call aforced

tim e.W e went on theforced m arch.  I'll tell you why it's called theforced march.
 
 
By the way, by that time, there was nofood
, n
othing. T he only thing we had, if  youa
re  
strong enough to stand in 
line
 
--
 
by that time ever ybody was the walking dead, literally.  T he 
food they gi ve you, like sugar beet soup. 
 
 
By the way, all along that's all we got.  Instead of  coffee,they give you this sugar beet 
broth. It was made out of som e kindof a beet they usedf or cattle. They made it intoa te
a .  
So you got a little bit, half apintor a pint, whatever.  Like a cup.  You got that. They usedto 
gi ve you a chunk of breadonce aday.  Right? 
 
 
T h i s  tim e
 
--
 
by the way, the bread was m adem ostly outof  sawdust. So when they 
tried to cut it, the bread literally, because it was old and sawdust, it literally crum bled likebread 
crum bs.  So I rem em ber literally putting out your palm of  thehand. T hey would put it into the 
palm of  your hand.  T hat was the rationfor the next 24 hours
 a
nd that littlepint thing.
 
 
By the way, we cam eback f rom Mauthausen. T hat's what we were gi ven already.  So 
that, af ter living like this, we had to go on a march.  Consequently, you realize most people 
were not able to march.
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  You're talking aboutm arching for days not hours.
 
>> MartinW eiss:  By the way, it was blue and white and green,m ildew chunks literally.  
Literally chunks. Like the size of a pea. Youknow what I m ean?
  
And guess what.  You ate it. 
 
 
One thing I would like to say about Mauthausen, too. W hile we wer e in Melk, the 
workin g cam p, we were a m ixed com munity. Like Im entioned before
, 
there were Pols, 
Russians, Greeks, Italians, younam e it
, 
Serbians,all kinds of people f rom all over, whereve r 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

26
 
the Germans were occupying.
 
 
W e came to
 
Mauthausen.  First thing they did was separate the Jews f rom the 
non
-
Jews. T hen they figured, aha, this is ourend. W hy would they separate us out?  Here 
until now we were all together. Sothey put us on the sideof  them ountain outsidethe camp.  
T h is
 
was a very neglectedarea, full of brush
; l
ike thorn bushesand stuff likethat. W hile we 
were there, by now we  were hardly getting anything.  If  you got what I just mentioned you,you 

were lucky.
 
 
Oneday, I can't rem em berhow long, but we had beenon t
his f orced march.  The 
forcedm arch consisted of  literally just m arching.  Most of the tim e they took usthrough country 
roads but we were going, we were told
 
--
 
the rum or, nobody told us
 
--
 
to the Swiss border. 
T hey're going to change us for Am ericans givi ng trucksf or us.  Now, I was like 15 years oldbut 

I was not af ool.  I said
:  W
ho's going to give trucks for us? W eareuseless.  Heapsof  nothing. 
 
 
So what happened,aswe m arched, if  som ebody fell down,f irst thing 
the 
guard would 
pick upthe rif le
 
and 
shoot him  right there.  T his wen
t on the whole tim e we were m arching.  I'll 
gi ve you an incident. W e were on a country road. There was apotatoon the ground.T here 

was onef ellow saw the potato.  He leapedfor it.  Anotherf ellow jumpedfor the same potato.  
Noticed itat the same tim e. They startedf ighting over the potato.  Guess what. The guard 
just picked up his rif le and just aim ed at hisface and shot him in thef ace.  Just like that.  
Shows you how lif e was.  Not tofor the sakeof  time. 
I ' m s o rry.  
 
>> Edna Friedberg: W e needtof inish up soon, yeah. Sorry.
 
>> MartinW eiss:  Ok. I'm  going tohave to skip som e.W e cam e toGunskirchen. There was, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
27
 
again, anew camp,f ive barracks.  I'm  tellingyou, f ive barracks. W e had to go in.  By the way
,  
in every cam p you went in, you have to stay outsideall day, rainor shine. You have to go
 
--
 
a t 
night you have to get into thebarrack. 5,000 m en ina barrack.  Im agine.
 
 
So we went in.  Literally, I'm  not exaggerating, we have to stand up like t
h is. It wa s 
squeezed like sardines.  You couldn't evenmove.  But I was younger, so I was able to sortof  
like jiggle down a little bit and sortof  squat. That's how you spend the night.
  
In the m orning, 
by the way, the placewas quite a num ber of bodies
 
every m orning.  People just didn'tm ake it. 
 
 
By this tim ealready we were in ver y bad shape. But here, again, luck.  I mention
 
--
 
the reason Im entioned work battalions, Hungary, they brought them in when they evacuated.  

W ho d o 
you think
 
--
 
I wa s  in  Me
lk,his brother, we got separatedona transport.  First day I 
cam e there I run into his brother.  He was in the Hungarian labor
 
--
 
he was pretty good with 
conditions, so were his friends
;  
so two buddies.  I hooked up with them .  Butm ind you,out of  
12,00
0, 13,000 
pe o
pleand walk intohim and see him . 
 
 
Anyway, I was ver y, ve ry happy that I saw him . If elt a little more conf ident now.  But 
here things are so bad that literally people were literally f alling onthe ground 
an d
 
just couldn't 
get up.
 
The last 
lin e . 
 
 
Oneday we were toldwe were liberated, that theAmericansare there.  Ididn't see 
Am ericans. W ethought it was a trick
; t
hat we would go outside the gate, they'll have m achine 
guns and mow us down. This ishow you think af tera while. 
 

 
So guess what.W e didn't leave. W e stayedan extra night just to make sure. T he 
next m orning we realized thatthe guards were goneand we are ok. So we started looking for 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
28
 
fo o d. 
 
 
Again, I'm going to sort of  just get to the point. W e lookedforf ood.Oh, we
 
came to a 
f ield. W efoundthis truck.  It was an Arm y truck but sort 
of  i n  
a ditch, in af ield. We lookedin 
thef rontof  the seatof the truck and there was a big tub of lard.  Just open tubof  lard.  And 
lard, what are we going to eat? W e were hungr y.  Lard would kill us.  Right?  First of all, how 
you could eat lard? 
 
[Laughter]
 
But ithad som ething to do withf ood
.  S
ooneof  the guys, like I say, they were in f airly good 
shape yet because they were just inf rom  Hungar y
, t
ook his f ist right through 
the glass. All the 
glass went into the lard.  W e took the lard on the grass and we scoopedout with the palm s of  
our hand, scooped outthe glass and saved the lard.
 
 
Now we were really excited. W ehad som ething to go on.  Right? So then before we 
le ft w
e looked in theback of  the truck and we discovered a goldm ine. W hat was it?  Leather 
hidesall ref ined already that we coulduse.W ereally got excited because we knew we'l l need 

shoes.  During the war  there was nothingfor shoes
, e
specially in Europe.
  
Nothing we hadfor 
anything.  So we got excited.  Each one of us rolled up.  Couldn't carr y too muchbecause I 

was ver y weak.  I rolled up afew of them .  Everybody had whatever they could carry.  
 
 
W e went and saw a f arm house not f ar away.  W e come to the f arm house.
  
T h is  is  
som ething, I'll be honest, when I started speaking, I spokef or3, 4 years andforgot this story.  

Now I have to include it each time.
  
It ca me
 
to th e  
farmhouse. Mindyou, we were full of hate.  
W ehated Germans like 
you 
would not believe.  I'll speakfor m yself .  I hated Germ ans likeyou 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

29
 
couldnever hate anything m ore than Idid
. 
 
I rem ember that these guys were
 
in
 
f airly good 
shape. T hey were pretty strong.  T hey were big gu ys. W e cam e tothe door and knocked on 
the door.  Instea
d of barging in like hoods, we knockedonthedoor.  Som ething aboutus to 
this day I don't know why we did that. 
  
 
 
So we knocked on thedoor.  Lady cam etothe door.  Sheopened up the door a little 
bit.  I guess she was afraid.  She was hom e alone. W e
 
asked her for some eggs, f lour, and 
water.  T he lady ran back in the kitchen. Shecam e tothe door.  She gave it us. W e never 
went into the kitchento cook the stuff. W e just took it.
 
 
Shehad abarn in thebackyard.  Shehadone of those iron kettle
s 
that you see,the 
rustic kettlestoheat up water for the Cowboys, whatever
, t
he same thing. So we builtafire 
underneath. One of the guys m ixed up the ingredients.  He made dum plings.
  
That was our 
f irstm eal.  Inf act, one of  the guys ran into one of  his uncles,an older m an, about 50 probably.  
He was a rare thing because m ost in the50sdidn'tm ake itby then. They couldn't take the 
stress.  Hedieda couple of days later because he ate a little more than he shouldhave.
 
Anyway, so we m adedumplings. W e had really a good meal. I rem em berf eeling very, very 

content.
 
 
T henone of the guys suggested
:   Yo
u know som ething, what we should do is take
 
--
 
eachone take som e 
hides
 
and give it to the lady.  Not oneof us com plained.  Nobody 
objected.  W e just
 
d id  it. 
 
 
T he reasonI'm m aking a pointof  this
, it's on ly af te rI sta rte d  
speaking three,four years 
later Iforgot this. Now I like to include it. I could never understand to thisday wh y we acted 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

so noble.W e never, never entered herhouse, never pushed her around, never did anything
, 
b
utactually ga ve som e paym ent. Theonly thing I could say that we were raised a certainwa y 
with certain values.  Ok?  And the reason I'm proud of  it is becausewe didn't loseour 
humanity.  Because by that time Ididn'tf eel like ahum an being anym ore.  Ok? 
 
 
So I'll end it right here, too,ok? SoI just wanted to bring that up.  How you raise your 
childrenm akes adiff erence.  Even under these circum stances
 
--
 
and believem e,af ter it was 
over I still hated Germans
 
for a long tim e.  Idon't now
,  
but I didfor a long tim e.  It took a long 
tim e to get itout of m y system .  But I realized by hating them  I hatem yself  as well.  And I 
learned not to do this. 
 
 
I'll stop right there.

>> I just wanted to know if these early experie nces in your development,how it m ight have 

aff ected later lif e choices and educationandcareer. 
 
>> Edna Friedberg:  Could everyone hear her?  Ok.
 
>> MartinW eiss: T hat's a pretty good question. I'm  very lucky.  I handled it, with hindsight, I 
th in k p retty 
good. By the way, when we came out, we had no place to go
; 
nom oney, nothing.  
I was literally on m y own. 
 
T hree weeks af ter liberation
 
--
 
some people stayed in Germany or 
Austria, wherever.  They stayed in the cam ps and soon. I chosetogo and lookfor
 
m y s ib lin gs  
because I knew if Im ade it,they made it. SoI picked m yself  up at my cousin's that Im et and 

we went backto our hom e area.  
 
 
It just so happened
 
--
 
little detail about it. We cam e back.  All thebridges were 
bombed out so we had to get ona train, get off a train, go through the gully and out tothe 
other side, catchanother train and so on. Anywa y, we got to the city of  my area. This was a 
big railroad station, m ind you. Again, luck. Out of all thepeople I ran into
 
--
 
m ind you, I wa
s 
15,16 years old
 
and I ran into a man I recognized
, i
n abig station.  I'm  talking like G
rand 
Central Station.  I asked him if he ran acrossm y brothers. And he said yeah. He says:  Y
our 
brotherescapedf rom the Hungarians, set uphousekeeping but not in your town.  He already
 
--
 
he was already married.  So he hada housein a different area, a different county
, e
n t ire ly 
different area. I was never there.
 
 
By the way, in the United States, 15, 16, you're knowledgeable. You see television.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
32
 
W e didn't k
now
 
--
 
you were af raidto go to
 
a city.  You just were notusedto it.  He toldm ethis 
information.  And guess what.  I started going tom y hometown.  I madeupmy m ind I would go 
to see where m y brother is.  Ifound him  there. T hat was m y f irstbreak.
 
 
Anyway, we stayed there for a little while.  By the way, the Russianswere there. W e 
realized the Russians were not going to leave. T hey were not going back to Czechoslovakia.  
So we escaped very early.  I could give you lots of details about it but I'm not. Anywa y, so we 
we
nt to the Czech Republic.  W efound a sister also survived
, o
ne sister.  One sister died.
 
 
From  thereon I justpicked up lif eas it came
, n
ever interested psychiatrist.  Asfar as 
educati
on, that's onething
 
that bugged m e because I 
couldn't go to school.  I came to the 
United States very early because
 
--
 
hada sister lef t two weeks before the occupation. Sheleft 
for the United States.  She was able to get an aff idavit. W e were able to come outa year later 
to the United States.  So I came here early. 
 
 
T hem inute I got here, again, I was independent. I gota job.  I gotm y own place to 
live.  I lived on m y own.  Althoughm y sister lived nearby so Ihad lots of  support.  From  there I 

went on. SinceI actually couldn't go to school
 
because 
--
 
I literally startededucating m yself.  I 
usedto go to night school f or years. It was just onpiecem eal.  Never complained toanybody.  

Never cried to
 
anybody.  Never went to a psychiatrist.  
 
 
I didok.  I raiseda nice fam ily.
 
 
[Applause]
 
>>
 
Edna Friedberg:  Question here.  Is thereanother question? 
 
 
I can say that Marty isver y beloved by all of  us hereat them useum . He is not

Are there other questions?  Yes,one right there. 
 
>> Have you ever taken your fam ily, your chil dren,and your

or your grandchildren back to

down. 
 
>> Is there anything that your neighbors thatwere non

Jews could have done?
 
>> M a
rtinW eiss:  Not really.  I'll tell you what.  They were not in a position.  First of all,m ost 
hadnothing.  Ok? T hey couldn't have done anything.  
 

 
By the way, the Hungarians didn't like them  either because they wer e Russians
 
--
 
n o w 
they 
c
a ll t h em  Uk ra
ines. T hey were good people,hard
-
working.  T hey didn't have much. T he
y 
were scraping a livin g.  The Hungarians looked atthem as just like the Germ ans did
 
--
 
h o w 
can 
I put it? Inferior.  So they didn't even consider them  as people. T hey just didn't
.  
Y
ou have no 
ideahow it is.  Thereare som any things that
 
--
 
when som ebody thinks they're so high above 
you, they just don't see you.  I can'texplain it. They didn't like the 
H

was ver y little they could doeither way.

T imefor one last question.  One second so everyone canhear you, please. Thank 
you.
 
>>W hat were som eof the custom s that your fam ily practicedthat would go away in 
that 

childhood with such values
 
of how you lived through it and where you are today.
 
>> MartinW eiss: T hevalues we had are notcom plicated. T hey're ver y sim ple.  My f ather was 

a stern man.  Fath

what do
 
you 
ca ll it
 
--
 
I guess the teachings of the Bible, if  you 
w
i l l .  W e ad
here to it.
 
 
One thing you learn, the first thing, you respect your elders, your parents, respect 
other people. 
A n d 
f ortunately m y fam ily, we were all like this.  But it's not justm e.T hese 
fellows, thef irst supper, nobody objected.  Here is a Germ an wom an we hated.  Ok?  
D
id
 I 
really hate her?  Butbecause we were so dehumanized we didn'tf eel like we were part of  the 
human race. But the population,the 
Hu
ngarians, looking atthem
 
--
t
hey didn'tarrest them
, b
u t 
t
hey looked down on them. T hey were not nice to them  because they were Russian, Ukraine, 
whatever you want to call them .  Hungarians were here and they we re here.
 
 
T ha t ' s
 
--
 
by the way, that tookm e a long tim etof igure out. That's why they were able 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
35
 
to do it. W henthey com m itted thoseatrocities, they didn't see you as a person,as human 
being. T hey saw you
 
as som ething else. If  you hada bunch of  ratsin a barrel and you just 
shoot them .  And this is the way they lookedat you. Andthis is why they were able to do it.  

T here's no other explanation. 
 
 
N o w,  wh y
 
do 
people get like this?  I don't know.  But my upbringing, m y whole fam ily, 
they were big gu ys but they were not brutal.You know, they were ordinary people. T hat'sthe 
difference and I'm  proud of  that.
 
 
By the way, I raised my kids that way.

In closing,
 
I would liketo thank you allf or being here and listening to m y testim ony.  It 
is ver y im portant that deniers of the Holocaust don't succeed.  
S
ix m illio n ,  1

were m urdered in them ost brutal 
f ashion
b
y oneof  them ostm odern and enlig
htened 
countries at the tim e
 t
hat gave usf am ous philosophers, scientists
;  
were also capableof  the 
m ostatrocious acts in history.  All those killed have no gravesite m arkers.  Instead we have the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum ,a memorial museum
 
that serves as theonly 
m em orial andused as
a  
teaching tool to stopbigotry and hate. Even today thereare groups 
and countr
ie s
 
that teach hate to children often in the name of religion.  
 
 
In Hebrew 
Scriptures
 
there's a saying, "
Repair
 
the world."   I'm
 
very proud as all of us 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

should be
, 
that the United States HolocaustMem orial Museum  exists.  Iteducates people f rom  
all over the world to repair this world.  By thewa y, the translation torepair the world m eans 
thatevery person is responsible to leave abetter world than hefound.  So we takea lesson 
f r o m  th a t.
 
 
I will also, if  you don't mind, I speak

I'm telling you, they all behavef antastic. T hey care.  
You'd never know we have bigotry in our own country.  They are really terrif ic to see thatour
