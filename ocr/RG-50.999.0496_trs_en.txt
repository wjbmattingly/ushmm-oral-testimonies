1940.  In 1941, Germ any attacked Yugoslavi a and itsally Hungar y occupied Steve's town.  Lif e 

changed imm ediately for Steve andhisf am ily.  Jews in Subotica
 
were subject
 
to Hungarian 
racial laws which were m odeled af ter those inGerm any.  From Septem ber
 
1940 to May
 
1944, 
Steve'sf am ily li ved in one corner of their apartm ent.
 
 
in May
 
1944, Germ any
 
occupied Hungary and Hungarian

occupied territories like 
Suboti

1944, Steve and som e ofhis fam ily

Norm a, if you would give a little wave.  T hank you.
 
 
Stevef irst began speaking about his Holocaust experience in the late 1970s when 
he becam e the f ou
nding presidentof a Holocaust Survi vors' organization in Pittsburgh.  Upon 

his second retirement from  the NationalInstituteof  StandardsandTechnology in Decem ber

about hism other,a graphicartist who perished inAuschwitz, and som e ofher work that was 

rescuedduring the deportations. Steve's granddaughter, Hannah, agraphic artist herself ,was 

thedesigner of the book. Copiesof  thebook are available in the Museum 's storeor you can

W ith that I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our 
F i rs t  Pe rs o n
, Steve Fenves.
 
 
[Applause]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Steve, thank you som uchfor joining us andbeing willing to be our
 
F i rs t  
Person
 
and to be the f irst
 
F i rs t  P
erson
 
live
stream ed. Pretty remarkable.  Youhave som uch to 
share with us ina short tim e so we'll start right away.
 
Steve, you were nearly 10 years old when the part of Yugoslavia wh ere you lived 
was occupied. And,of course, yourfam ily's life changedforever af ter that.  But before we turn 

to that tim e, why don't you tell us about yourfam ily, your com munity, and yourself in thosefirst 

10 years of  your lif ebefore the war began.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Ok. Thank you.  Suboticawas part of  Hungary until the
 
end of W orld W
a r 
when thenew country, Yugoslavia, was f ormed; that portion was turnedover into this new 

country. W e lived a very norm al life. Thefact that we spoke Hungarian at home and learned

Serbian in school didn't bother anybody.  Everybody li ved that way.  W elived a very 
comfortable, upperm iddle class lif e.  
 
 
My f ather, as Bill said, was m anager of the printing plant.  Andthenwhen his 
brother, whof ounded the paperpassedaway, hetook over theeditorship.
  
My m o the r, at tha t 
tim e was not very acti ve in doing art but shedid some comm ercial work, som epaintings. Our 

f a m ily wa s  we ll o f f
; 
am aid, a cook,and what was ver y im portantto the generation of m y 
parents, a governesswho taught us perfectGerm an because at that level of  

Hungarian
-sp e
aking society, you had to speak perfect Germ an.
 
 
Religious observances were sort of m inimal butm y parentsattended regular 
services, holidays, festivals, etc.  And we as children attended religious school after regular 

school threeaf ternoons a week.  And
 
then on Saturday af ternoons since regular school went 
till noon onSaturday,Saturday right af ter lunch there was a youth service run by the students.  

T hat was m y religious education.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Steve, you said to me that yourfam ily was highl y ass
im ila t e d.   Can  y
ou say 
m ore about that?
 

>> Steve Fenves:  I don't like to use the term assim ilated.
  
I like to use the term  cultur
ated 
because nothing was given up in order to be accepted. But, yes, thefam ily was ver y 

m u ch 
--
 
felt very conscientious of  its Hungarian culture and leadership in the Hungarian 
culture. Thenewspaper that m y uncle and thenm y f atheredited was the largest circulation 

daily in Hungary, welcom ingm any journalists who were f leeing Hungar y as it was becom ing 

m ore and more fascist.
  
Sothat kindof  leadership position in the culture was ver y m uch a part.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather'snewspaper was ver y inf luential,as you've mentioned.  Your 

fatherf oundhim self  just right up to the edgeof  what the Serbian censors would allow.  Ri
ght?
 
>> Steve Fenves:  I remem ber the paper was completely composedandactually put on the 

rolls of the printing press.  And thenone copy was run and that was taken to the censor's 

off ice. And the censor would strike out whatever he didn't like.  If itwas a full page,then the 

page appearedblank. If it was sm aller than apage, it was just chiseled outby them echanics 

right on the press.  Yes, Yugoslavia was a m ilitary dictatorship.  Hungary, Hungarian
-
speaking 
people were subject to censorship.
 
>> B i
ll Benson:  Ihave to bring thisup, Steve.  Your years as a child, you m entionedtom ethat 
W ednesday af ternoons was a tim eoff for the govern
e ss 
and m aids so you had f ree reign with 
your seven cousinand you did terrible things.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> S t e ve  
Fenves:  Yeah.  Seven cousins living in Subotica,one livin g in Budapest who 

occasionally joined us.  And we were deposited at our grandmother's house, which was an old 

peasant
-
style house with a large garden andshed. W e were let loose. W e were pretty l
oose.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Imust adm it, I being the youngestof  seven or eight, was alwa ys delegated 

to do the nastiest parts.  And I willingl y did it. 
 

 
For exam ple, in society where there'sno ref rigeration andeverythin g for the winter 
has 
to be canned orpreserved, we went in our grandm other's pantry, soakedoff  all of  the 
labels f rom  all of  the 
ca n
 
and jars, and random ly replaced them .
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Steve Fenves:  That's what kids do.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ittranscendsthe generations.

Steve, in 1941, Germ any invaded Yugoslavia  and Germ any's ally, Hungary, 
occupied the part of Yugoslavia where you lived.  From thef irst day of  their occupation your 
fam ily and community were imm ediately subjected toprof ound upheaval.  Tell
 
us what 
happened to yourf am ily afterthe Hungariansarrived.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Onthe very f irst day of occupationm y father was forcedout at gun point 

f rom his off ice, thenewspaper and the printing plant conf iscated by themilitary, turned over to 

an 
Aryanm anager who def initely intended to bankrupt thefam ily.  Oneof  hisearly actions was 
to block access tothe fam ily banking accounttom y auntand m yf ather and then charging the 

entire payroll of that plant to thatpersonal account.  Som y f ather's wealth lasteda week.
 
>> 
B ill B e n t o n
:  Andhe was now out of work.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  And he was now out of  work.
 
 
Sorry to correct you on your introduction.  Hungary f ree of Germ any in many 
anti
-
Sem itic laws but in one case preceded that.  Hungary introduced a law called Num erus 
Clausus which restricted thenum berof  Jews in higher educationtothepercentage of Jews in 

the total population
.  
Higher education starting at 5th grade.  So theGerm an scheme operated 

in Hungary as well.
 
 
So one of  the f i
rstthings I hadtodo was to cram for that entrance exam .  My f ather 
having nothing elseto do that summer coachedm e,and I was oneof  the nineoutof 40 or so 

kids who was accepted. 
 
 
Half the apartment was taken away, housing.  Off icersfortunately
 
--
 
junior off icers of  
ver y high rank were using this as a secondhom e.  From that pointonf or thenext three years 

ever ything depended on m y mother who quickly f ound out that her knitting work could be sold 

by m y aunts living in Budapestatm uch better price
 
than she could sell in Subotica so she 
developed am ajor enterprise, cousins,f riends, etc., doing knitting.  So we leave everything to 

m y m other's design wh ich then was taken toBudapest and sold. That was a large part ofour 

income inaddition to selling things like m y stam p collection.  
 
 
Yes, I know.  I was very proud of m y stam p collection.  My f ather instructed all the 
local editors and localdistributors of the paper to correspond with the newspaper not with 

regular stamps but with whatever special
 
stam p was available at the post off ice which Imade 
the grand tour of all of the desksand collected all of these stamps ever y week, soaked them  

down, packaged them , and instructedm y father whenever he went to Belgrade and Budapest 

to trade them for stamps that Ineeded. So that was one of the early things that went, 

silve r wa re , e tc., e
t c.
, etc., everything went.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentioned youhad aGerm an governess. Onthe very f irst day of  the 

occupation she lef t.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Right.
 
>> B ill 
Benson: W hywas that?
 
>> Steve Fenves: W ell, I think the very f irst day of occupation the current law of  Hungary was 

announced that gentiles were not perm itted to work f or Jews.  But the governess who was 

Germ an national didn't even wait for that order. 
 
She announced that she wasn't going to 
spend onem orenight in a Jewish house.  She justpacked up and lef t. That was the greatest 

liberationthat m y sister and I experienced.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that time, what happened with your educ
ation?
 
>> Steve Fenves:  As I said, I had academ ichigh schoolbut Jews sat in theback, never 

addressedby the teacher.  There was nopoint raising your handsfor theanswer because the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

teacher was never going to even look at you.  I guess I got a goodeducation.  But notf rom the 
teachers
 
--
 
I can't tellwho was m ore anti
-
Sem itic, the onesbrought inf rom  proper Hungary or 
the locals including som e who had workedfor m y f ather who hadpositions in thehigh school.  

Ever y day was a hum iliation.  My parents
 
hadtof orce me to go to school. My sister just 
absolutely refused to go to school
, t
o academic high school in thoseterm s. And she was 
accepted in aparochial school run by
 
--
 
I don't know theorder butthe Catholic schools 
including the off shootof the Jesuit schools.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywere will ing to open their doors.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You,of  course, told us that on the very f irst day of  the occupation, yourf ather 

lost his newspaper. After that there was a trial over the
 
newspaper. Can y
o u  t e ll u s a  lit t le 
about that?
 

>> Steve Fenves:  I don't know the date, 
`
42, 
`
43. T he takeover had to be legalized.  So there 
was a trial of  all them isdeeds that warrantedthe conf iscation.  My f ather andm y aunt just 

refused to attend
.  Ithink m y sister attendedoneday.
  
My f atherand aunt were heart
broken 
because people who had workedf orthem  were m aking incredibleaccusations.  Oneof  the 

accusations was that disrespectfor Christianity by having the worker s work on Sundays to 

p ro
duce Monday's paper. The fact that every other paper
 
worked on Sundays toproduce 
Monday's paper didn't count. T his was one of the indictm ents that justif iedthe conf iscation of  

the paper.
 
>> Bill Benson: T his obviously was just a terrible timef or your
 
father.  You said tome that 
coaching youm usthave beena big source ofem otional outletfor yourf ather.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  I'msure of that.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ill you say a littlebit more about that? 
 
>> Steve Fenves:  My father valued hiseducation.  He was valedictorian of his high school 

class, which m eant when thatoccurred that he had to give his speech in Latin.  He never said 

anything specif ic, Idon't rem ember. ButI'm  sure that it was a source of prideand a source of  

satisf action thathe could help me.
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that period leading upto 1944, of course events elsewhere in Europe 

were horrif ic and the Holocaust was underwa y.  Did you have any idea what was happening 

elsewhere in Europeduring the war?
 

>> Steve Fenves:  I had som e
 
inkling.  Som e news, som e people f leeing from Poland.  There 
were warnings but m yfam ily
 
--
 
the upper crest of  Hungarian Jewry c ouldnotaccept thatthis 
was happening because they were so closely associated with Hungarian and German culture.
 
 
Just as an 
exam ple, two of m y cousins were drafted intothe Hungarianf
o rc e
d  
labor 
service which was theequivalent of m ilitary service.  T hey used theseforced laborers in 

horrendous,horrible conditions.  Many, m any died including m y m iddle cousin. I think there 

w
as such a thing as leave.  They were homeat leave. They went to theirm other and said the 
partisansare on theother sideof  the Danube.  Atnight they would swim  across the Danube 

and join the partisans in the woods. And sortof  the controllingf orcein the wholef am ily, just 

went ballistic.  No self
-
representing Jewish boy will s wim  across the Danube at nightand join 
those people in the woods.  She nixed the whole thing.  Her m iddle son died under really 

horrible conditions on the Soviet f rontandf orced labor cam p.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Despite how bad all of thesecircum stances were, they were about to turn 

inf initely worse.  In thespring of 1944 with Hungary about to capitulate to the allies Germ any 

m oved quickly to occupy Hungary in the areas
 i
t 
had oc
cupied, including your town.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Conditionsf or yourf am ily turned worse immediately.  T ell us whathappenedas soonas that 
happened.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Ok. 600 Germ an soldiersconstituted the total occupation of Hungary.
 
>> Bill Benson:  600?
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Yes.  W ithinfour weeks 400,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz.  No w, 

ask yourself how 600 soldiers can marshal thef acilities to take 400,000peopleoutof  their 

homes,m ove them  in tem porary quarters, dothe logistics of getting trains in place,and
 
pack 
these people on trains in boxcars to Auschwitz.
 
 
T he answer is that there was no onearoundwhen we were deported. T he 
Hungarian 
state police 
--
 
if  you go to the collaboratorsexhibit, you'll see them . Black hatswith 
blackf eather.  Had the plans ready. T hey just needed the Germ ans' authorization and the 

entire thing was organized, perf orm ed, andexecuted by the Hungarian
s
. T hat was the extent 

of  the occupation.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hathappened to yourf ather?
 

>> Steve Fenves:  My father was taken very early by Hungarian detectives in civil ian clothes, 

deportedtoAuschwitz long bef ore us. T hreeweeks later we were put into thesem akeshif t, 

horrible makeshif t, quarters for a couple of weeks
;  
then to another makeshif t arrangem ent.  A 
s m a ll villa ge  w
a s c
onverted to a concentration cam pandf rom  there on loaded on boxcars and 
shipped to Auschwitz. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyour f ather was taken,did your m otherhave any idea where
 
--
 
>> Steve Fenves:  No. No.  No.  No idea.  No comm unication whatsoever. 
 

>> Bill Benson: W henthe rest of thef am ily was thenforcedto go into the ghetto, you 

described tom e that that day is oneof your
 
gri m me s t m em o ri e s .
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Very m uch so. W e lived on the secondf loor.W e had the orders to move 

out with whatever we c ould carry.  By that time the word got around.  I don't know how but the 

entire hallway and theentire stairwa y was lined with people waiting to enter and ransackthe 

apartm ent andas we were leaving, yellin g at us, scream ing, spitting in ourface
 
as we lef t.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And som e of these were people you knew.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Yes, including people whohad workedfor m yf ather.  But among them  was 

ourf orm er cook that we had to let gofour years earlier because wedidn't have the money and 

because the law said that we had to letthem go.  She lined up with the looters, gothold of m y 

m other's cookbook and a largefolder and stuffed into it all of the artwork on paper that she 

couldf ind andtook it. She kept it.  She returned it to us when we returnedafter the war.  She 

sent ittous when we cam e tothe states. The cookbook isat theexhibit down the hall.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And som e of those piecesof art?
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Those pieces of art,f inally under pressuref rom  children, grandchi
ldren,
 
and 
particularly two daughters
-
in
-
law who threatened to do it on their own, I produced them .
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwas it like f or youandyour f am ily when you were f orced into the ghetto?  

W hat were conditions like?
 
>> Steve Fenves:  T wo, threefam
ilie s  in o
ne room, no sanitary conditions,m i
serable food, etc.  
I was oneof  thefew people who were allowe d out of the ghetto as soonas theoccupations.  I 

started working in amachine shop of aformer em ployee who happenedtobea Serb
 
and 
therefore was discharged by the Hungarian adm inistrator.  I worked in his machine shopand 

hada pass to exit theghettoevery day.
 
 
So onm y 13thbirthday, on June
 
6, 1944, through the BBC broadcast we heard that 
the invasionof  Norm andy had started. And I presum eI
 
must have been the f irst person to

bring thatnews back into the ghettobecauseby that tim e radios were conf iscated years 
earlier.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You described that tom e asa terrif ic birthday present.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Oh, yes.  Def initely.
 
>> B ill B
enson:  Steve, you weren't in the ghettofor very long bef ore you were f orced out and 
sent to Auschwitz.  T ell us what you can about going to Auschwitz a nd what happenedonce 

you arrived there. 
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Boxcars were lined up, Hungarian ge
ndarm es
 
pushed you in, 60, 80 to a 
boxcar, one bucketforsanitation, which, of course, didn't last very lo ng.  Peoplebarely able to 

sit down atf irst. Nofood, nodrink, nothing. I don't know the exact tim ebut it musthave been 

four orf ive days and nights.  People goingm ad.  People dying
 w
hich  m eantthat you could 
stack them in one corner andf ree up a little spacefor sitting down.
 
 
W e,of  course,didn't know where we were go ing.  T his incredible thing facing you.  I 
think thef irst thing I rem em ber was the
 
sm e ll, th e sten ch
, t
he stench of  burning f lesh.  The 
sm ogf alling down including small piecesof prayer books burnt.
 
 
T he next thing was this wave of  SS and cam p inm ates throwing you outof  the 
boxcar.  Those of youwho have seen" Schindler's List" may rem ember the nice gentle ramp 

on which the childrenwere allowed to 
descend
 
with dignity f rom the railroad. T here was no 
such thing.  You hadtwo choices.  You jum ped outor you were thrown out. Lined up, 

thousands and thousands of people, wom enon one side,m en on the other side.  It was my 

last lookatm y m other and sister.  Men,four tof ive abreast inf rontof this Germ an officer.
 
 
No w, m o st of 
t he  
people you interviewed will have told youat this tim ethat

selected them.  I can't make that statem entbecauseIwas not introduced to the 
gentleman. He waved m ethis way
 
o r 
that way.  T hat was m y total interaction with him .
 
 
But anyhow, we wound up in this hugefacility, stripped naked, shaving off  all hair, 
disinf ected with stuff
, h
ours later given som e tattered clothing and broken
-
down shoes.  No 
underwear, no socks,no nothing like that.  Eventually you could trade with each other to get 

som e shoes that wereuseable.  Marchedat running speeds into the compoundthat you 

showed.
  
T he f ollowing 
m orning, linedupfor the firstfood in six or seven days which untilyou 
hada cup, you took it in your hand.
 
 
T he conditions were horrible.  One day a week
 
--
 
one occasion a day to go to the 
latrine.  Older inm ates advised you totakeapebble so youhave som ething to wif e yourselfat 

theend of using the latrine because toilet paper was not oneof  the things provided. 
 
Food, 
horrible.  And very soon, understanding that the other sidem eant the gas cham ber and the 

crem atorium.
 
 
Auschwitz, in addition to being an exterm ination cam p was also an enormous 
holding pinfor potential slave labor. T hink of the stockyards in Chicago or other places inthe 

Midwest.  Living beings boxed in waiting to be selected. T hat was Auschwitz. 
 
Germ an 
c ivi lia n s ,  m ilit a ry,  c a m
e ona regular basis selecting workers f orfactories, quarries, roadwork, 
whatever. 
 
 
T he trouble isthat Iand m y buddies were placed in what was called theboys 
barracks.  Most of uswere under the ageof 13 to 15 or thereabouts.  People whoneeded 

s l a ve
 
labor never stopped to select f rom  that crowd be
cause they wanted laborers. So you 
would just die in the spot.  Yourbody diesbefore your m ind dies.  You could see these people 

shuff ling around totally aim lessly, eyes turned in, no senseof  wherethey were, dragging 

them selves throughout the day.  In the morning when crews cam etocolle

night, as likely to pickup these half deadpeople and throw them onthe cart and take them  
directly to the crematorium withoutbothering to take them through the gas cham ber. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You arrived atAuschwitz with  your m other, your sister, and your grandmother.  

W hat ha p pe n ed  to  t hem ?  
 
>> Steve Fenves:  My grandm otherm issed one leg below the knee.  She was gassed right 

away, I'm  sure.  My mother was very tired, had asthm a. I am absolutely sure
 
--
 
I have no 
direct inf orm ationabout passing away but I'm sure that she was oneof  these people who just 

deterioratedtothepoint where she was carted away with thedead. 
 

 
My sister, we'll get to in a m inute. I hadthe opportunity tom eet her 
in
 
Auschwit
z 
which was not a com mon opportunity.  She eventually was sent out, worked in afactory 

threading f ilam ents in light bulbsand eventually was liberated inBergen
-
Belsen.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You ended up getting chosen tobean interpreter.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Y
u p.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us how thathappened.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  The overseers were German crim inals brought in f rom prisons to serveas 

overseers; ver y cruel, terrible people.T hey spokeGerman. T he inm ates spoke Hungarian.  

So they needed an interpreter.  I spoke better Germ an thanhedid.  Didn't take long to 

convince him topick me asan interpreter. T he benef it was thataf ter the inmates weref ed,I 

hadthe opportunity to scrape out thebottom of  the barrelsf rom  which they were f ed. 
 
 
T he  C
om p ou nd
 
C  wa s  we l l
-
known, wel l
-
known in the Holocaust literaturebecause 
one quarter of it was 
o
ccupied by gypsy f am ilies, not labor
-
agedm en but older men, wom en, 
children. One night they were exterm inated.W e were locked up inour barracksbut we could 

hear the scream s, theyells, the shouts. Andthenext m orning there was this deathly quiet.  As 

an interpreter, I hadaccess tothef ront of thebarracks, so I could peek out and I saw inm ates 

em ptying the barracks and whitewashing the insideandoutside. I saw a new set of  

supervisors.  
 

 
T hef irst thing I noticed, that instead of the green of the crim inals they had red 
triangles of  political prisoners. One of them  cam e over.  Heneedednow an interpreter who 

spokePolish, Hungarian,and Germ an.  Ihad never heard a word of  Polish in my lif ebefore 

but I knew that it was a Slavic language so I volunteered.  At 13, inthese conditions,a lot of  

people have reported that childrenhad abetter chance to survive than adultsbecausethey 

hadnot yet learned the kind of things that a culturedperson doesn'tdo.
 
 
So I volunteered. Turned out Polish was tougher than I thoughtbuteventually I 
becam e

duration of the hostilities that didn'tm atter. They had a comm on enem y.
 
 
Oneof m y jobs was tointerpretfor people com ing to selectprisoners, m eetthem at 
the guard house, escort them , interpret, lie when I could
 
when I hada sense of what kindof 
people they were intervie win g, thenI could certainly translatethe answers of  theprisoners of  

the inm ates in am orefavorablef ashion.  So that was m y job. But this was the Auschwit z 

resistanceorganization.  Ihad a chance to participate.
 
 
Oneof  our activities was the roof repair detail.  Miserable woodenbarracks.  I'm  very 
unhappy with the barrack that's reproduced on the thirdf loorbecause it looks so cleanand 

spacious.  It wasn't at all that way in particular.  Roof s were leaking, winter was com ing.  So 

the SS allowed this roof repair detail with a cart, with a barrel and ro
ll
s of  tar paper to gof rom  
com pound to com poundf ixing roof s. So thatwas an activity.
 
 
W e visitedm any of the wom en's com poundsfor the very sim ple reason that the

overseers, those com pounds were girlf riends
 
of  ours.  So there was lots of repeat visits to 
som e of the sam e compounds. 
 
 
In oneof  those, Im etm y sister.  You could see on theopening
.  S
he was alwa ys 
known for her reddish,long braids. She now hadabouttwo centimeters
-
long red hairs just 
st ick
ing out. This was already Septem ber,Octoberand in a sleeveless sum mer dress.  But 
she's the one who inform edm e what she had heard about ourm otherf rom others. 
 
She was 
dueto gooutona transport and so I cashed in all m y blackm arket goodsto gethe

anda sweater bef ore she left.  
 
 
B la ck ma rke t
ee r
in g
 
wa s thebig activity.  It's am azing how little it took to bribe 
guards, including SS soldiers.  SS off icers you didn't bribe but SS soldiers.  Everything wa s on 

the black m arket.
  
In particular, we also wentto the compound called Canada, the warehouses 
were inm ate women sorting the goods takenoff f rom  theprisoners,arriving, sorting them for 

packages to be sent to Germany. T hat was a great sourcef or blackm arket goods. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T here are several other things I know you want to share with us.  You were in 

Auschwitz f or I think about f ive m onths.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In anabsolutely astonishing wa y you lef t Auschwitz.  Can y
ou tell us about 
that? 
 
>>
 
Steve Fenves:  Latef all things were getting ver y tough.  Oneof  the crematories was blown 
up. There was news com ing in that the Russians were closing in. The cam p was sort of  

closing down.  Selections becamem uch more severe. T he Polish 
kapos
 
who prom ised to 
guardf or the rest
 
--
 
until we were liberateddecided to sm uggle m eout on an outgoing 
transport.  Ihad never been selectedto go towork.  So they pushedme in the line.  I got 

tattooed.  At thattim e, in Auschwitz, by that tim e incom ing inmates were not tattooed. T here 

were too many of  them.  Just those who were going out. T attooed. T he 
kapos
 
had som e 
better
-
f itting clothesthan what was handed out. W e were put on a train
,  
three days of train 
ride. W e wound up atthis small village, sm all town called Nieder Orschel.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatkind of welcom edid you get at Nieder Orschel?
 

>> Steve Fenves: W edebarked. Railroad signing.  T he SS off icergave a talk. T he plant 

foreman gave atalk. The Hungarian interpreter
 
--
 
I guess the interpre
ter.  And just before we 
were dism issed theforem an walks up tom eoutof  a transportof  300
-
some people
, 
"W
hat  a r e  
you doing here?  I didnot select you."  
 
 
It happened thatI was his interpreter when he was in Auschwitz selecting workers. 
 
W ell, the 
kapo
s 
in Auschwit z coachedme the wa y you hear on the news when presidential 
candidatesare coached by their stafffor anyeventuality that may com e up.W hatever they 

could think of they coachedm e about. T hisnever occurred to them .  SoI was entirely onm y
 
own.  I thoughtfor am inute.  And I said, "
W
ell, sir, with thatm any new inm ates they thought 
that you needed another interpreter."  The 
guy shook his head.  He said, "That sounds good"  
and walkedaway.  T hat was the easier part.
 
 
W e were led intothe barracks, seated atbenches, tables which we hadn't seen for a 
long tim e, handed some warm f ood which we hadn't seenfor a long tim e. And the Hungarian 

interpreter satonm y lef t, another on the right, squeezing m e inandstarted questioning m e.  

W ho a r e  yo
u? W hereare youf rom ?  How com etheforem an knows  you?  How com e your 
clothesare so muchbetter f itting than others?  And really grillin g m e. 
 
 
T hat nightI was led in the 
kapos
 
r o om .  T
hisparticular overseer was a Germ an 
political prisoner, in cam p since 1933.  Andthis was 1944
 s
o you can im agine what the 11 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
years do toa person. And the questioning resum ed.
 
 
Oneof  theorderlies was a gypsy.  He hadheard rumors, wanted toknow what I 
know.  T his cam pandthis cam p Jewish inm ates were together with Soviet prisonersof  war.  
Germ any did not observe the Geneva Convention with respect tothe Soviet Union.  So a 

representative of  the Soviet POW s, Ukrainian off icer, whenheheard that I spokePolish,for a 

m inute we attempted to converse inPolish.T hen we both realized that Russian is
 
--
 
Serbian is 
m uch like Russian and 
n
either is Polishand switched.  Sothe conversation wentm uch more 
sm oothly.  But most of the night I was grilled.  Sort of the terrain changed becausethey 

realized thatI knew a lot m oreabout Auschwitz than normal.  90% of the people who survi ved 

Auschwitz was theref or four days or less.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you had been thereforfive m onths.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Forfive months. So I was accepted intotheir organization.
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  Steve, I know I'm  jumping aheadherebut
 
yo u
 
would stay at Nieder Orschel 
for almost six m onthsuntil April of 1944 when you were forcedona Death March. Tell us 

about thatm arch andabout your liberation.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Ok.W ell, just am inuteabout Nieder Orschel.  Itwas a factory owned by 

Messerschm itt producing wings f orf ireplanes.  I guarantee you we did not collaborate with the 

enem y becausenotone of those wings ever f lew.  T his was a last attem pt by Germany to 

disperse its industries. This village was upon the railroad line.  Material com ing in, wings going 

out.T he railroad line was bom bedat both ends so we were sort of doing nothing. Anyhow, 

they collected us.
 
 
W hen they announced
 
--
 
we knew that the march was com ing because the same 
kitchenproduced the guards'food as well asours.  Andthe inmates take food to the guards, 

saw them  packing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Saw the guardspacking.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Saw the guards packing.  The younger
 
--
 
without a call,all of  us in the 
o r ga
nization were in the 
kapos
 
room  in less thanam inute.  The younger people wanted to 
stage af ight. W e hadkeys to all the guards'room s including the weapon room.
 
 
Question.  How do you get a set of counterfeit keys in this situation? It's pretty 
sim ple. You take a piece of bread and chew it in your mouth until it's m alleableand the guards 

who take theirf eed
 
--
 
the inm ates who take the food tothe guards just makean im pression.  
T here were plenty of locksm iths,plenty of material outof  which tof ashiona blank key, plenty 

of m echanics and stolen files tof ashion keys. 
 

 
Anyhow, the older people didn't want to go along.  So we m arched. 11days on the 
road. Out of 700 I think 300 arrived to Buchenwald.  Foodf or a whil e, there was som efood.  

T
here was nofood either.  People being shotforf alling behind.  People attem pting escapeat 
night, som eof  them  successf ul, some of them shotas they went along.  Most distressing was 

in the morning, localpeasant
s 
bringing attempted escapes back, proddin
g t hem  wi t h  p i t c h  
forks, leaving big gashes in their backs and covered with barbed wir e leaving m ore gashes but 

they delivered them back to the
 S
S guards.  So that's how we lived for 11days.
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that march you had your arm broken.
 
>> S
teve Fenves:  I had m y arm  broken. BecauseI talkedback to a guard.  At 13 I should 
have known not todo.W e m ade it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He hityou with the rif le butt?
 
>> Steve Fenves:  Hitm e with the rif le butt. Eventually the road was going up the hi
ll.   
Eventually I couldorient m yself f rom  the guards talking
, f
rom  what inm ates described, andwe

arrived in Auschwitz.  I can'tbe 
a great
 
wi t n e s s
 
for the liberationbecauseI just conked out and 
som ebody woke m e up two days later to say thatthe Am ericansarrived.  And that was that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you went pretty quickl y to af ield hospital.
 
>> Steve Fenves:  I went
 
--
 
didn't go. T hey carried m e. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Steve, so muchmore I would like toask you but we have afew minutes.  I 

think we
 
should turn to our audienceand askif  we have som e questionsf rom  you.
 
 
W ehave m icrophoneson both sidesof  theaisle.  If  you would, try to m ake your 
question as brief as you can.  I will do m y best to repeat it just tomake sureeverybody, 

including Steve,hearsthe question.  So I think we can get afew in if we can. 
 
 
So right here imm ediately. 
 
>> 
W here is your sister now?
 
>> Steve Fenves:  My sister, we got togetheraf ter liberation. W e both went back to 

Yugoslavia.  My f atherwent back,as Bill said, passed atf our months and died. W eescaped 

together, cam e to the statestogether.  She lived
 
--
 
she passedaway two years ago but we 
kept very close.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you.  Right here.  Andthen I'll com eover here.  Yes,please.  Yeah.  

W e ha v
e am ic com ing to you. 
 
>> 
I'm  not sure if you can answer this question easily.  But atage 13 I can't believe what 
you've been through or what you were li ving t hrough.  How did you survi ve, just m entally?  

How did you get through what you got through?
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  Asa 13
-
year
-
old young, how did you get throughm entally, how did you 
survi ve? 
 
>> Steve Fenves: W ell, I connected with thePolish overseers. I was certain that I was going 

to be carted away.  My sister chastisedm ef or having said that.  She said she was always s ure 

that she was going to survive.  So thef irst couple of months there was nothing todrive m e. I 

was m entally and em otionally dead like everybody else. Once I was associated with the 

political prisoners, everything changed. Survi val was not guaranteed but there was a chance 

of  survival and there was a reason to survi ve.  There were def inite things you could do towards 

im proving your chances of survival.  And that's how I survi ved. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Do you have a question?
 
>> 
W e'
ve got people tweeting at us all over the place, students watching in California, in 
Georgia, and Pennsylvania. One person wants to know
:  W
hat's the m ost important thing you 
want young people today listening to your story, what do you want them to know and what 
do 

you 
w
ant them  to takeaway f rom  watching you today? 
 
>> Steve Fenves:  That's always the closing comm ent thatBill asksm e.  Always asks m efor a 

closing comm ent. That's always it. 
 
 
You have tobeon guard for any f orm  of discrim ination, inequality, persecution.  
Th
ey
 
m ay sound insignif icant to younow.  Th
ey
 
m ay sound likeafun thing todo on tweeter or 
other social media, but they can just as likely escalate into more serious things.  And whenit 

was supported andauthorized and even abetted by the governm entandthe police, then it 

leads to genocideandworse.  T hat's what I wantpeople to rem em ber. 
 
 
On one side the Holocaust isunique,as theMuseum 's statem ent indicates.  T he 
Jews were specif ically picked to be annihilated because they were J ews.  But the Holocaust 

also has an enormousuniversal signif icancebecause oncehatred,persecution, intolera
nce 
arises, it is very easy f or it tobe channeled intom ore severe things including murders. That's 

what I hope to transm it to young people.

oneoff icer. Im mediately the next day hundreds and hundredsof  peoplemarched to the site of
