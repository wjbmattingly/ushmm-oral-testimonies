Answer: Formally, it™s
 Rochelle Ann Rothschild Sherwin
. In college -- where I 
work, it™s 
Shelly Rothschild Sherwin. 
Q: And when were you
 born and where? 
A: I was born March third, 1951, in 
New York City. 
Q: Were you named after so
mebody who died or was mu
rdered during the war? 
A: Yes. 
Rose 
was my father™s sister who died, and 
Ann,
 my middle name, was for 
my mother™s mother. 
Q: Were you told anything about them? 
What do -- what -- what does it mean to 
you to be named after somebody? Is
 there any particular significance?

A: Well, a-aside from it being Jewish traditi
on to  be named after a dead relative, I 
hope that I live up to what I -- the 
stories th at I™ve heard about them. 
Q: Give us an example.  
A: My mother™s mother was a woman of 
great breeding and taste and refinement 
and culture, very family oriented. Very mu
ch in love with life and society and busy 
with philanthropic intere
sts and family affairs. 
Q: I know, of course, that memory goes only
 back so far, but it would be nice if we 
could go back into your ear
lier childhood and gets a sens
e of what -- what family 
life was, w h at -- what do you remember a
bout your parents. So my  first question 
would be, give our listeners 
who don™t know your parents 
a sense of who they  were. 
Your father -- who did you 
see o-of -- ho-how did you see your father when you 
were younger, and how did you see your mo ther?  

A: Well, my mother stayed at home, so I 
saw a lot more of her than my father, who 
w o rk ed  v e ry  h a rd . M y
 father, I always knew had fam
ily. I never met anyone of my  
mother™s family until I was eight years old 
and we met an aunt 
through marriage in 
Germany
. I know that my mother 
took me abroad 
when I was, I believe one year 
old, but of course I don™t rememb er havi
ng met her then. But I never knew family 
from my  mother™s side, which was a treme
ndous loss th-that I felt as a child. I knew 
that there was a huge, huge part of child
hood experience, havi
ng gran dparents and

aunts and uncles and cousin s missing from my  life. I was very keen ly , keenly  aw are 
of it. 

Q: Did you -- let™s -- b e-before -- well, let™s 
-- let™s follow up on 
this then, before I 
ask you again a little bit more about the pe
rsonas of the -- the persons that your 
parents were. Ho-How did -- how -- did you
 -- how did you ask th em about it? Did 
you ask your mo ther, how come I don™t 
have grandparents? How -- how did this 

evolve? 
A: My father came before the war, 
so his experience was growing up in 
America
 
from late teenage-hood on, here, as his brot
hers and sisters, who had been farmed 
out from 
Germany
 before the war. And th ey all had international experiences, 
some went to 
South America
, some went to
 Palestine
, some -- I mean, every 
brother and sister was sent to a different 
relative around the wo rld. His parents both 
died before I got to know th
em, his mother outlived his fa
ther, and was alive when I 
was born, but also died when  I was quite 
young. My mother™s side of the family  
only came through me -- to me verbally, 
because there were no -- no pictorial 
histories or scrapbooks, or mementos hand
ed down . So it was only her stories and 
my imagination that gave th
em any kind of reality.  
Q: How would she talk about them? 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001

A: She talked about holiday
s that she remembered when
 she was growing up, what 
her family life was like. The talents 
of the various people. The intellectual 
capabilities, the accomplishments. Her fam
ily  was very accomplished in many 
different fields. Sh -- and I think that™s 
why she had great hopes that I would be a 
pianist like one of her cousins who was wo
rld renown ed. That didn™t do t -- I didn™t 
do too well there. Maybe a dancer. The Ru ssi
an -- the Russian balle
t instructor told 
my  mo ther, save your money. So th -- so 
-- so there were -- there were quite a few 
talents that I did not pick up from her fa
 -- family side, but reading and education 
were certainly something that she impr
essed upon me and I develo ped my  own 
curiosity in pursuing. 

Q: Do you remember the circ
umstance of when you so rt of first became aware of 
your mother™s experience during the war, 
when you realized she was a Holocaust 
survivor, although at that time you would not
 have thought about it in those terms, 
probably . 
A: No, th e dawn ing was gradual, but the 
visual indicator was always there. My 
mo ther was always physically very diffe
rent than other mo thers. Her physical 
disabilities worsened as I grew up, and 
it was because her condition was becoming 

mu ch mo re visible and apparent to the out
side world th at then I came to understand 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
5
that she had been born perfectly normal
, but because of the beatings that she 
received in the camp, it was the cause of
 these physical abnormalities worsening. 
Q: How did -- how did you learn ab out that
, though? Did you as
k her questions, or 
did she under certain condi 
-- circumstances talk about that? Ho-How did you learn 
about it? 
A: There was never a special day that I reme
mber, that was set aside to say this is 
what happened to me. It was, I think, alwa
ys part of my consciousness. I think -- I 
reme mb er one thing, one day I rememb ered
 seeing one of my  friend™s parents who 
had a number on their arm, and I asked 
my  mo ther why she didn™t have a number 
on her arm. So I knew that 
there was a commonality of e
xperience that my friend™s 
parents had been in camp s, and my  mo th
er had been in  camp , but there was a 
difference. And I think that started  the storytelling a bit more. 

Q: Did you have -- you just mentioned you
r friends. Did you ha
ve Jewish friends 
and non-Jewish friends, or pretty mu ch Je
wish friends and were there si -- children 
of -- of survivors, other children of survivors among th em too? 

A: The area that I grew up in in the 
Bronx
 was a terrific mix of Jewish, Italian, Irish 
and in high school, black. But fo r th -- my  
earliest school experiences, I would say 
95 percent of my  classm
ates -- at that time 
New York
 used to place you in a class 
of your ability, so the classes were numbered 
one, two, three, four, so if you were in

the first grade in the first class, that me
ans that you were the most academically 
superior. So always being in that first 
cl ass, it  seemed th
at the make-up was 95 
percent Jewish at that time. 
Q: Did you talk -- did you 
have close friends, like r
eally very close friends? 
A: I still have them to this day. 
Q: Oh, you do? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Did -- did you talk to them -- were th
ey children of Holoca
ust survivors too, by 
any chance? 
A: The three friends that I have from wh
en  I was 10 years old were all American 
born and their parents were American born, 
so no, they -- they 
didn™t experience the 
particular childhood that I did. But I had ot
her friends in the second circle of my -- 
of my associates that had 
Holocaust survivor parents. 
Q: And did you talk to your
 friends about it, and to  your best friends about -- about 
that in some way, did you feel that you wa
nted to? Did they ask?
 They probably got 
-- came home -- 

A: Sometimes I remember there were discu
ssions at -- at -- at lunch about parents 
having nightmares and we would only di
scuss it amongst ourselves. My mother 
wasn™t one of those, but -- but I had a friend, 
Ma ry  Chewbo wski
 who used to tell 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001

me about her mo ther™s nightmares, and we 
were very protective of each other. It 
was almost a different circle of friends, 
the immigrant kids, then the other Jewish 
kids who really didn™t have any way of re
lating to what it was like to have to be a 
nurturing support to your elder parent. It
 was -- it was a role reversal even at a 
younger age that some  of my  friends had. My
 mo ther at that point was stronger than 
some of my  friend™s parents, who were mu
ch more emotionally crippled at that 
stage, at that stage. My mo ther was st
ronger, but the years have taken their toll. 
Q: Let™s stay in the earlier years a little
 bit. W h at do you remember from your 

family life? What di -- what did you do? Wh at was the relationship between you 

and your parents?  
A: I was an only child. I was told very ea
rly on th at my  mo ther had lost all her 
family, and when the doctors to
ld her that she was not supp
osed to have a child, that 
her response was that she di
dn't survive the war not to
 have a child. So no matter 
what the physical cost wa
s going to be -- which put a little guilt on me because I 
knew that she was taking a risk and did 
damage her condition further by bearing 
me, but that she felt th at she lived for 
a purpose and the purpose was to have a 
family, and that was me, but there was only 
just me . So I didn™t have any brothers 

and sisters. I didn™t have any gran dparents
 or cousin s, or people from her side that 
she could relate to.

Q: When  you lo ok back, wh at kind of 
a child do you think 
you were? How do you 
see yourself as a -- as a -- as a younger ch
ild? I don™t want to lead you, just how did 
you see yourself?  
A: My mother will probably 
say that I was spoiled, and 
I don™t think so. My -- I was 
-- I was -- I will admit that my parents were
 extraordinarily generous of their time 
and the amount of input that they put into
 my cultural awareness.
 I grew up in the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art, I tel l ever
ybody that I did. I 
-- I spent more time 
going to  botanical gardens and zo os and Radio City Music Hall, and shows wh en I 
was young. And I turned around and did 
th e same thing for my  daughter because 
my -- my life -- my childhoo
d was so full of extraordinar
y outings, that I couldn™t 
wait to turn around an d do that when I had 
a child, so I -- my -- 
my social activities 
with my parents were extrao rdinary. Maybe that was to 
make up for lack of family 
affairs. 

Q: I take it from your -- from what you just
 said, that you did not experience that 
necessarily as -- as a pressure, but more as
 an opportunity, or 
was it a lso someti mes 
a -- a -- a pressure behind this to -- to
 -- having to fulfill certain expectations? 
A: No, I wasn™t -- I wasn™t exposed to 
these things necessarily to have them 
drummed into my  psyche that this is wh
at you mu st know in  order to be a cultured 
person. Everything was on an
 equal basis. Going to  the movies, or seeing the

Rockettes was on the same leve
l as going to a ballet. So 
everything was done with a 
sense of -- of fun and a special occasion,
 and dressing up and 
going downtown to 
Manhattan
. So it was -- it -- it w as never an e
xpectation that I would be able to 
then recite to impress anybody what I ha
d been  exposed  to. It was just something 
that would cu -- just culturally open me up 
to the rest of the world, outside of 
New 
York
.  
Q: When  you went to the 
-- to the homes of your friends, did you perceive 
differences? Was your upbringing a different one? And if so in wh at -- in what 
way? 

A: I always believed my  parents to be mu
ch more strict th an
 my mu -- than my 
friend™s parents who were American born
. And we™re talking about my  Jewish 
friends. Some of their parent were the -- 
brought up in  the 40™s here, very liberal, 
virtually leaning on the Communist way, so 
that they were allowe
d to stay out late 
and make decisions for themselves when  my
 parents said, we have to know where 
you are and who you™re with and what time 
you™re going to come back, and so  I felt 
that there was much stronger
 bungee cords on my freedom 
than my par 
-- than my -
- my peers experienced. Now that I™m a 
parent, I don™t know whether it wasn™t a 
good idea, cause I prob
ab ly  mimi ck ed  mo re 
than I -- than I want
 to admit. But no, 
my parents were more strict than my fri
ends. And ma -- and my
 friends used to 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
10
push me and my  parents would explain to my
 friends why they did what they  did. 
And ma -- and my friends respected and 
still respect my parents for doing that. 
Q: Are your parents very different from 
each other? Are they -- how -- do you see 
them very differently? 
A: Entirely differently. 

Q: Describe the -- 

A: Entirely differently. My 
mother is the inte
llectual. My father is the very 
easygoing sense of humor. My mo ther is ve
ry nerv ous and ferociously protective. 

My father was strict, but yet,
 not as verbal about it as 
my mother was. But I didn™t 
want to cross any lines with my father. 
Q: Let™s talk about your education a little 
bit. You -- what kind 
of schools did you 
go to  in the beginning? 
A: I went to public schools, 
New York 
public schools were wonderful at that time, 
and then  to, as I said, keep broadening my
 field of reference, my  parents would, on 
a very meager income, sacrifi ce a nd send me to Swiss schools for the summer ti me. 

I always say that there was a finishing sch
ool and th-they finished  me off but good. 

I™m very polished, highly polished, to a g -- a great gloss.

Q: I detect the irony, of course, but -- but 
si -- say -- say a little 
bit more about that. 
Was it -- I mean, it was obviously a ve
ry different cultural experience 
[indecipherable] Euro pe. 
A: Yes, I mean they sent me to -- they
 sent me to sleep a w ay camps in the 
United 
States
 and -- when I was younger. Some of th
em were Jewish, some of them were 
not Jewish. My memories of them are that 
I -- I know that they
 sent me away from 
the city so I didn't have to bear the city heat. My -- befo
re I was sent away to camp, 
we always went away -- my mother and I went to the 
Catskills
, and my  father 
would co me up week ends, just like the othe
r fathers would come up and visit, so 
that my summers were very pleasant. But th en when I became of
 an age where there 
-- they wanted to also have some kind 
of growing experience, or benefit to be 
derived from a summer away, that™s wh
en they  looked into these schools in 
Switzerland
 for me, and I went to the same
 one for two summers in a row. 
Q: Did you thi -- when you were in -- 
how old were you when  you were in 
Switzerland, 
roughly? 

A: I believe 14 and 15. 

Q: Did th at subject ma tter ever come up, being in
 Europe
? I mean, 
Switzerland
 
was neutral at the time, but sort of th
e Holo caust, did that ever come up? 

 
Interview with Shelly

A: The ho -- interestin g, you know, the 
Ho locaust itself did not. There were some 
Jewish children who came from v ery 
nouveau riche 
families in 
New York
, and 
there were Arab children there as well wh
ose -- the younger ones were being trained 
to hate anyone Jewish. The older ones my  ow
n age were a bit more tolerant. This is 
-- you -- you know where -- this was close to wh en 
Israel 
had been  founded, so 
there was some leniency and understanding 
with the children my
 own ag e, but the 
younger ones were already be
ing disciplined to avoid us, 
and they  called us -- they 
called me the enemy. I re -- I remember 
that distinctly, that
 the younger wa -- 
younger ones would come up to th e table wh
en I was sitting with friends and they 
would say, how could 
you sit with the enemy? So it wa
sn™t the Holocaust, but it was 
being Jewish.  
Q: Do you think it was difficult fo
r your mo ther to let you go?  
A: I™m -- I™m sure -- I™m sure fo -- for any 
mother of a single child, it™s difficult to 
let a child go, but you g -- you get trem
endous satisfaction fro
m seeing your child 
come back glowing with th
e experience. If they™ve had 
an  unhappy experience, of 
course you carry that guilt with you also. But what could 
be terrible about spending 
the summer in 
Euro pe
? So I had -- I had fabulous tim
es, and it -- it certainly ma de 
a seed germinate that I wanted to study in  
Europe 
later on, wh ich I did in 
university.

Q: Let™s stick with being a teenager a little 
bit. You so rt of came of age in a kind of 
an interesting time. I mean, the 60™s were
 rolling around. What -- what had impact? 
I mean, there was so much happening at 
that time, what -- what -- what had an 
impact on you? What kind of mu sic did 
you like? How were you as a teenager?  
A: I was a very -- I was a very typica
l teenager. I was as crazy about the 
Beatles
 as 
everybody else in 
America
. Some of my American seco
nd generation friends were 
experimenting with drugs, and this is where 
the strictness factor came in with my 
parents, they -- they practica
lly used to sniff out the ba
ckpack s of my  friends when  
they came in, were very, ve
ry protective about what wa
s coming into  the house, and 
-- and what was be -- what activities were be
ing engaged outside of
 the house. So I 
was not as brave, or as adventurous as 
some of my American friends because I 
didn™t want to upset my  parents. 
Q: In terms of social movements, was ther
e anything that kind of had an impact on 
you, that sort of was important to you? 
A: I wanted to belong. As an only child, I always want
ed to belong. And wh en I 
started university, I thought I would pledge 
a sorority. And at the same time, at -- 
literally, simultaneously, at th
e time that I w as going to be sworn in a secret 

ceremony into the sorority, there was a huge anti-war protest on my campus. And it 
was one of those lifetime awakening moment
s, and I said, you know what, what I™m 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
14
doing right now is ridiculous
. What™s happening outside is mu ch mo re important, 
and I walked away from the sorority
 and I join ed the an ti-war movement. 
Q: What did you do fo
r them, or with them? 
A: I -- I joined the studen
t protests. I worked for 
Eugene McCarthy
. I worked for 
Bobby Kennedy 
on -- especially  when he was s
hot, I started my own initiative for 
gun control and I -- and I took ar-around apetition for signatures and then sent it to 
Washin gton.
 That™s when I started becoming po
litically engaged. I was just on the 
young end of being mo re ra
dically involved in the anti-war movement. I was, but I 
certainly wasn™t the leade
r, I was more of a follower. 
And then as I became a bit 
more informed, I started work
ing within political moveme
nts rather than the more 
radical ones that were ha
ppening on co llege campuses. 
Q: I know of course that things don™t alwa
ys work  on that kind of simp listic, linear, 
logical order, but do you th ink that the experience of your -- that your awareness of 

your mo ther™s past and of the Ho locaust 
and so on, and second Wo rld War had kind 
of sensitized you in a different way, or is 
that no -- is -- is that not -- set apart from 
it? 

A: The -- the 
Vietnam
 war was affecting my friends, and I didn't see it as a 
corollary to World War 
11
. I mean, yes, if you want to
 take war is a b ad thing in

general, but that was really so subliminal
. It w as -- it was affecting my friends, my 
friends were having to go 
th rough the draft. So it was a close, personal fear.  
Q: Okay , let™s talk about your ed ucation 
a little bit more. So what did you study, 
and when -- we have to -- I -- I w ant to get 
a few figures in there, so that we don™t 
get totally lost in -- in -- in where 
we are. You -- you went to college? 
A: I went to college and then I went to
 graduate school as well, and I got my  
graduate degree in English, I specialized in 
Shakespeare. 
Q: When  was that? 
A: Not very commercial. Not 
very marketable. Let™s see, I graduated very early, I 
skipped a grade in junior high school, I ente
red college at 16, wh ich is very early, I 
graduated when  I was 20. That -- that is ve
ry young, that is very young. I wouldn™t 
encourage many people to do th at. 

Q: Why not? 

A: There were some th ings that I missed
. I was -- I was rushing through school so 
mu ch that when  I graduated early, I didn ™t get to attend the graduation ceremonies 

with my friends because I was already at 
the next level. So when  I graduated high 

school in January  and was in college, I di
dn™t go back  in June for my  high school 
graduation. When  I graduated co llege in Ja
nuary, I didn't go back in June for my  
high school -- so I have no pictures in 
a cap and gown, even 
though -- even though 

 
Interview with Shelly

I™m -- I am s -- I have so many degrees, I 
don™t have one picture 
in a cap and gown. 
When I got my Master™s in 
England
, I alre -- I had already moved to the 
States
, so 
I didn't go -- I don™t have a picture of
 my  Master™s graduation, either. 
Q: You™re pictureless. 
A: You j -- you just have to take my  wo
rd for it that I have all these degrees. 
Q: So when did you -- okay, I have to -- I 
just really want to get a few figures in. 
When  did you graduate? You said 
[indecipherable]
 
A: ™72. 

Q: ™72. When 
did you go to  
England
? We have talked about 
Switzerland, 
but not 
about 
England
. 
A: I had a -- a political science professor who saw something in me that -- I don™t 
know, one of those little flickering flames
, and he encouraged
 me to go for a 
summer program to 
Imperial 
College in 
Lo ndon, 
and that™s where the passion for 
Shakespeare 
was ignited. I came back and did my
 -- because everything was on a 
half -- because I had come in early, I wasn
™t on a normal September to June, this is 
my freshman year, this is my
 sophomore year. So I did my
 last half of my freshman 
year and my  sophomore year back at 
Hunter
 College. I did my  junior year at 
Leeds
 
University, thrown in
 with the English students, with
 none of the background that 
they had. American college 
at that time was extraordinar
ily different than English

university where they make you speciali
ze in one field. They will pay for your 
education in a field that you have demonstr
ated talent in. When  I was in school in 
the 
States
, they make you take two years of ever
y kind of course under the sun, it™s 
like a smorgasbord, so that you become out 
-- well, more rounded, rather than have 
a very gr -- huge grasp of one field in pa
rticular. And then I did my Master™s in  
England
 at the 
Shakespeare 
Institute. 
Q: Culturally, did you feel 
that you were -- that you fit in, or did you feel very 
different, or what was the -- sort
 of the situation, how did -- 
A: I™m a hypocrite. I married an Englishman
, but the English students in general -- I 
got out -- I got along with them, and I -- an
 I -- and I™m an anglophile, I consider 
myself an anglophile, but they always ke
pt me a little bit at arm™s length, they 
always used to call me Yank. Which to 
me was distancing. You know, there was 
always, you know, we™ll have the Yank co
me along. I-It wasn™t that -- and I made 
friends, and I made very good friends, but 
it was always just that, you know, I was 
the colonist. They were the 
-- they were the Royalists a
nd I was the colonist. And it 
-- and it -- that was all the way through sc
hool, it never changed. And then I ended 
up marrying an Englishman. 
Q: Before we get to the Englishman, let 
me just ask you one question, then  we 
should probably  change th
e -- the tape. What -- huh. Well, since I forgot the

question, let™s change the tape right away. 
I™ll remember it. This is a continuation of 
the 
United States

Shelly Sherwin. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
Shelly Sherwin
. This is tape number one, side 
B.
 So here comes the 
question I forgot before. Back in school again,
 in -- in -- in history class, or what did 
you have, political science or something? 
Did -- did -- did the Holocaust come up in 
-- in a way that -- that was compre
hensive, profound at that time? 
A: It certainly didn™t have the emphasis th
at it has now. I think th ere™s a -- a -- a gru 
-- a greater sensitivity to the teaching ofthe Holocaust. I think we learned more 

about World War 
11
 than the Holocaust, now that 
I think about it. It wasn't as 
specifically  defined. It was a factor, but 
it wasn™t taught as a ma jor portion of -- it 
was just one -- another fact that you learne
d. You know, there were so many camp s, 
there were so many killed. The -- the camps 
were located here and there, and really, 

the French came in here, the French gave up this. It really wasn™t -- it wasn™t 
emphasized by itself.

Q: When  you talked  -- did you ever go 
to your mo ther and ask her specific 
questions, because my -- my -- 
my guess is that -- that th
ere -- there must have been 
questions. Did -- did you go 
and ask her, or was it mo re of a -- or did she tell you -- 
A: There -- there -- there were times in -- in
 -- in the natural flow of conversation 
when  we would be speaking about her fam
ily, and I -- I certainly always wanted to 
know when she was separated from her family , what happened to 
this part of the 
family. I-If she talked 
about say, the concert pianist, 
what happened to
 him? But it -
- it -- it wasn™t that I was asking her for 
a -- a history course on the Holo caust, it 
was in -- in th -- in the form of just mo re nor -- normal conversation. 

Q: Was it difficult for you to hear or to as
k about specific things that had happened 
to her? Was it -- I mean, she was your mothe
r, was it difficult to -- to -- to -- to hear 
specifically  what happened in terms of -- 

A: I never -- it was a v ery fine line that I 
felt that I walked. I 
never wanted to  ask 
her things that would bring back very 
painfu l memo ries. I had a visual reminder 
every single day of what happened to her. 
Every time I look at her now, the entire 
Holocaust experience is enca
psulated in when I look
 at her. So knowing the 
specifics was not as important as grasping  the entire experience. And it happened i-
in the smallest things. When I had to go 
sh opping with my  mo ther and nothing ever 
fit because her deformity is so limiting in
 what she can and cannot even try on. I 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
20
was aware of it on so many different levels
. Her physical limitatio ns, her lack of 
energy, her -- the pain that sh
e™s in, the brace that she has to decide whether to put 
on or take off. If I have to take it now an
d -- and wash it, how 
gentle I am because 
there are no people left that we can find
 who can duplicate the making of these type 
of handmad e corsets because now everything 
is corrected very early on in surgery 
so people don™t have to suffer the type of
 scoliosis that she ha
s. So when I would 
ask her, it really was a familial re-memor
y -- memory that we would talk about 
rather than the brutal beatings. I -- it was 
hard enough for me to look at her without 
having to know exactly ho
w it happened. And 
-- and -- and it™s still very difficult 
for me to imagine someone do
ing to my  mother what had to have happened  to  her. 
Q: And you couldn™t really bear to hear it, rig h t? 

A: No, no. I have -- I have a very heighten
ed sensitivity to film
s, to photographs, 
because I don™t have, as I said earlier, any 
scrapbooks of family pictures. Every face 
could be a face of a relative. So there 
can be -- even though the number of my 
mother™s family is finite, when I see pictur es of hundreds, they all become related to 

me in a sen se because anyone of them coul
d have been a true 
family  member. I™ll 
never know which ones were. It -- on rare
 occasions my mother has found books 
and she has found not Holo caust photograph
s, but from before the war, photos of 
people who were in her family
, in very formal, stylized por
traits. And I look at them 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
21
almost like I look at
 a picture of Queen 
Victoria
, there™s -- it™s such a far relation, 
it™s saying my  goodness, this is a pers
on who was in my family. It™s -- it™s 
extraordinary because 
there wa -- there was such a stop
, there™s such an abrupt halt 
in any kind of family continuity  becaus
e there are no letters or photographs or 
visual sightings, or meetings or anything. It
™s rela -- it™s trying to relate something 
personal to a picture of an entire stra
nger. So my sensitivity
 towards Holocaust 
materials is -- I f -- I find as I™m getting olde
r, it™s harder and harder
 for me to -- to 
look at the stuff. 

Q: How did it make you feel -- how did y
ou feel about the perpetrators? How -- 
how did you feel at that -- at the earlie
r time? Did it make you angry, sad? What 
was sort of the overriding response? 

A: To be brutally honest I have tremendous
 reserves of hate. It™s geared towards the 
older generation. I don™t know who is inno
cent and who is guilty, 
I just know that 
guilt by silence is as damning as guilt by pa
rticipation. In my work on the college 
campus with the Jewish student group, we
 have our Holocaust memorial serv ice 
every year, and the 
Martin Niemoeller 
poem,  when  it™s read every single year, is 
more and more tellin g. When they cam
e for the Communists and no one -- and -- 
and I didn™t say anything, and th en they came for me. No one said anything for my  

family, no one hid an yone from my  family. 
My family -- my mo
ther™s family was 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
22
not lucky. My mo ther was the only lucky 
one, and she doesn™t feel lucky in having 
survived. She feels gu
ilty because there were so many shining, singular individuals 
in her family and she feels that w hy her, 
and -- and why did they  perish and why did 
she survive? So, it™s -- it™s very
 difficult for me to try, I -- I try to be as open minded 
and tolerant as I -- and give the benefit to
 everyone of a younge
r generation, but to 
my  mo ther™s generation, I don™t want to ha
ve anything to do with them. I™m just too 
suspicious and too an gry. 
Q: And does your mo ther feel the same wa
y, do you th ink? Did 
you talk, or did she 
ever talk about that? 
A: We talk about it sometime
s, and I -- I think -- I thin
k I™m -- my  mother really 
tries to be forgiving, it™s -- it™s getting 
hard er, because wh en we
 talk about it when 
there is a rise in neo-Nazism in 
Germany
 now, what has the 
country learned? Why 
should we be -- be more fo
 -- mo -- why sh ould we be
 more forgiv
ing when the 
country is opening itself up to th is type of ha
tred again? It™s -- it™s too threatening to 
be able to say that the country has learne
d its lesson and it™ll ne
ver happen again. It 
could. I™m not sa
ying -- I™m not saying a Jewish 
Holocaust will happ
en again, but 
that kind of -- of rise o f th
at party is very disturbing.

Q: We will maybe come back to so mething 
[indeciphera ble]
 it™s kind of awkward 
now to go back, but I would 
like to keep the 
chronology a little b
it alive. So you 
went to the university even
tu ally? You -- you studied 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I was here -- here -- here and there. I was in 
New York
 and then back and forth 
in 
England
. 
Q: Okay , and you me -- and you had the 
id ea of becoming what, professionally? 
A: Well, if I hadn™t met my husband, I 
was going to continue on and do my 
PhD
. in 
Shakespeare.
 I had a professor whose best friend was 
Lawrence Olivier. 
So I had 
my -- my 
PhD.
 dissertation practically writte
n for me, I was going to do 
Olivier 
as 
a Shakespearean interpreter, and have fu
ll access to his library and notes and 
movies and -- and then I fell in love, a
nd married my  husband and moved back  to 
America
 and th at was the end of that. So th
at™s -- that™s one ro ad not taken. 
Q: Let™s talk about your husband then, a little
 bit. When did you meet him, what is 
his name, why did you like him? 
A: Let™s see, we -- we met and fell in 
love and became engage
d within one week. 
We just had our 27
th
 anniversary. If my  daughter told me that she met somebody 
and was getting engaged in on
e week, I think I™d kill her. But -- we didn™t announce 

it until the third week, we thou
ght that sounded very matu
re at that time. And my 
mother was on the next plane after I told 
her that. Talk about protective. We met

three weeks before our final exams, he 
was in law school there, I was doing my  
Master™s. We both could have
 done better on our exams if we had stared at the 
books instead of into  each 
other™s eyes. I don™t think eith
er of us have any regrets 
about either not doing so well on our ex am
s, or -- or getting married, and ge -- or 
getting en gaged, actually tha -- as quickly  as we did.  
Q: What was the attraction, apart from the eyes? 

A: My husband has an extraordinarily ke
en mind, and a very dry sense of humo r. 
And I knew that as loquacious as I am, th
at I needed  someone wh o would give me 
space and listen to me. My mother says, yo
u always married your husband because 
he gives you center stage. Which is a very 
acute assessment. My husband is -- is an 
attorney and only really spea
ks wh en he need s to. So  we
 are -- we are very opposite, 
very, very  opposite. I™m very outgoing, 
he™s much quieter. But when he says 
something it™s so incisive, and so  intellect
ually challenging that there are few that 
I™ve met th at intellectu ally excite me
 as much as my 
husband still does. 
Q: Is he -- is he Jewish too? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What about his fam -- he was -- you met him in 
England? 
A: I met h i m in  
England
. 
Q: And he is -- he is British? 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
25
A: Yes. 
Q: So, how did you negotiate where you wo uld live? 

A: I said as long as I was goi
ng to get dressed up and be a 
bride, that I wanted to get 
married in 
New York
 and have the few distant relativ
es that I had grown up with 
participate in my  wedding. And we decided to  come to 
California
 on our 
honeymoon. And wi -- the decision was re
ally very  easy, when my  husband saw 
that it didn™t rain for three weeks straight
, he said, why go back. So -- so he came 
here before I was finished 
with my actual dissertation,
 so we got married and we 
were separated for three months in our first year of -- of marriage. S o  he came here 

and petitioned the 
California
 bar to be able to take -- ta
ke the exam. And I stayed in 
England
 and finished up my  dissertation, a
nd then came back an
d joined him in 
California
 and we™ve been he
re ever since. 
Q: Did you want to have children? 

A: Oh yeah, there was never any question. 
It was only after I had my  daughter, and 
she was a c o lic, she sc ared me off having
 more. But my husband
™s an only child, 
and I™m an only child, and I guess we didn™t
 want to feel outnumbered. So we were 
very -- we -- we both knew our -- our values
 are so in sync with each other, we 
knew that we wanted  to give her every oppor
tunity in the world, 
soif it meant study 
abroad, if it meant a
ll the shows in the worl
d, like I had gone to in  my  youth -- we 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
26
wanted to  not spoil her, but certainly expose
 her to as rich a childhood as I had had. 
So we made the decision ju st to have one. 
Q: So th at was a conscious decision? 
A: It was a very conscious decision. We
 wanted -- we had always, from when she 
was, I think, in her crib, we had always fe
lt that if she was intellectu ally capable of 
going to  a wonderful university, that no ma
tter how it -- we -- we would have to 
sacrifice, we would send her to the best 
one that she got into, and she got into 
Duke
 
University. 
Q: What is her name and when  was she born? 

A: Her name is 
Alexis Danielle Rothschild-Sherwin
. 
Alexis
 is also for 
Anna -- 
Hannah, 
my father™s mother, and 
Sa rah
, her -- her -- her -- her Hebrew name is 
Hannah Sarah
, wh ich is a blending of from my  
family and my  husband™s family 
deceased relatives. 
Alexis
 comes from 
Abraham
, who is the distant relative who 
was partly responsible for bringing my 
mother over after the war. And he was the 
only grandfatherly figure -- he wasn™t 
a grandfather, obvious, but the only elder 
figure that I grew up knowing as a lovi
ng relative and so wh
en my daughter was 
born I wanted to honor him because he had 
taken my mother into his family after 
the war. 

Q: Were you a work ing mo ther, or did you -- did you stay home? 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
27
A: I work ed very  hard at being a mo ther, and as my  child grew an d was in school, I 
work ed very hard  in her school s -- becau
se of the pub -- the state of public 
education and th e lack of funding for the ar
ts. I always took it upon my self to teach 
the -- the subjects that they didn™t have mo
ney for, so in terms of cultural and -- and 
creative enrichment, I would create programs
, get grants and then bring them into 
the schools. And I did th at
 all through high school. 
Q: So education in your fam
ily then, is a very important 
thing too. Education, arts, 
culture. 

A: Nobody had a choice in the matter. Yes, 
w h -when given the choice, if -- if I -- if 
-- if I don™t ask for jewelry, then I always as k to have tickets for a show. It™s -- it™s 
the creation of a memo ry that™s lifelon
g. O-Other things, cars and clothes and 
names on handbags, or things like that, neve
r meant anything to me. E-Even now, i-
if I wanted to and could afford it, I -- it 
-- it wouldn™t mean any more to me th an 
anything else. But going to  a show with my
 family and enjoying that experience, 
that™s what we enjoy doing. 
Q: So what -- let™s 
talk  a little bit about 
Alexis
 then, and then we sort of mix 
everything up ag ain and touch 
on a few other issues. What
 was her education? You 
-- she -- did she go to  public school, too? 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
28
A: We™d -- we™d -- my husband is a produc
t of English public education, and I was 
a product of American public education. And even though we 
live in a very upper 
class area of 
Los Angeles
 where many, many children, ev
en more so 
now, go to 
private schools from the earliest ages on, 
we decided that we wanted her in the 
public school with children from the ne
ighborhood. And that™s
 why I worked so 
hard to try and make the schools have as 
well rounded an approach  to the education 
that the funds would allow. And she 
went th rough public high sch -- public 
education all the way through high sc
hool. And th en when she got into 
Duke
 
Univ ersity, we said, well that™s your dream
 school. It was her number one school, 
and she was -- she had an -- an ex
traordinary experience there.  
Q: So describe her a little bit. Are you clos
e to her, first of all, and secondly, what 
kind of personality -- person is she? What ar
e her interests? Where is she -- where is 
she going, as far as one can tell at this point? 

A: Is -- is -- as -- she wa
s an only child, for the first 
half of her life she was my  
husband™s personality, very introverted, ve
ry shy. I kept on sa
ying, you know, how 
did she pass through this 
body and not pick up any 
of my  genetic material 
whatsoever. And then we did make a -- a c
hoice in terms of high school. Sh e could 
have gone to the very  close, local pub
lic high school, or she could go to a brand 
new high school wh ich was 24 miles away in 
Ma libu, 
also public, but they  wanted 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
29
to start a high school out there. And fo
r the very reason because her personality 
seemed to be -- she was in awe of other ki
ds, and I remember feeling, in my school, 
that I wasn 't the top student,
 so that the expectations we
re always that these are the 
top students, and I know wh ere I belong in  
the pecking order. I didn™t want her to 
face that same kind of glass ceilin g. So we 
made a choice to send her to this brand 
new public sc -- high school, wh ere there 
wouldn™t be any expectations and there 
wouldn™t be any reputations that she woul
d have to face or undo. She was allowed 
to reinvent herself. And she metaphysica
lly changed. Sh e became -- immodestly, 

she became me. She -- she b
ecame political. She became the president of the entire 
high school. She -- whatever was going on 
in that school she became involved in . 
She invented the traditions that are now 
being passed from cla ss to c lass. She was 

allowed to express herself without fear of 
being pegged  as one of the lesser students 

trying to  wo rk th eir way up. And so she wa
s one of the golden ch ildren at this new 
school. That completely made her so c
onfident of herself and her abilities that 
there™s no stopping her now. It was a very
 seminal decision. Sh e hated the traveling 
part of it, because it -- it entailed being on
 a school bus for an hour each way every 
single day. She -- she didn™t go with her 
friends from junior high school to the -- 
some had already siphoned off into  the priv
ate schools in the area, the others were 
going to  this public school. Bu t we thought 
that she would get lost in a school that

large. It was -- it was a high school of 
almo st 3,000 students, and the new public 
school, she was in a class of 120. And they
 were the first grade that went year by 
year through. So  she was th
e first ninth, the first 10
th
, the first 11
th
, the first 12
th
. So 
it made her who she is now. It absolutely ch anged her. 
Q: Is she close to her grandparents
? And to her -- to her grandmother? 
A: She™s -- she™s my best friend, and I rea
lly know in my  soul that she would say 
the same of me. We talk daily
, if not more -- more than 
daily, several times a d ay.  
Q: That™s all right -- 

A: Sorry. 

Q: -- some--something fell. You want to 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Something -- 

Q: I™ll pick it up. Okay. So you talk 
-- you talk several times during the day 
sometimes, every day? 

A: Yes. Everything from soulful revelati
ons to ethical decision ma king, to just 
general, this is what happene
d to  me today. Ever sinceI had my  surgery in August, 
she has ma de me feel that I don™t miss anyt
hing in  her life. She is the first one -- my  
husband is my rock, but if I need to talk to someone
, I talk to my daughter. 
Q: You also talk to your mother a lot. 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
31
A: I talk to my mother, but what I -- I fi
lter what I tell her now because there™s only 
so much that she can handle. 
Q: But you used to talk, I m
ean sh -- is it true, she told
 me that for -- for many years 
now you almo st talk every single day, that -- 

A: Oh, we still do, we still do, we still do. 
And also sometimes several times a d ay, 
too. But I don™t tell her quite everything. 
She can™t -- she can™t emotionally handle 
it. If I™m going through something, if 
my  -- if my  husband™s going through 
something, and he™s diabe
tic, but thank God, he™s very healthy, but -- or my  
daughter is going th rough so me unhappy ro
mance or something like that, we don™t 
tell her all the details because that™s what 
she feeds off of. And 
so metimes that kind 
of negative information w
ill not be good for her. 
Q: I was just reminded, when 
I talked to your mother in
 her interview, and I asked 
her about her family -- not -- not the later 
family, but her earlie
r family, she -- she 
said there was a very close relationshi
p between her and her mo ther and her 
grandmother. And it seems to me  almo st
 there is now another mo ther and 
grandmother and -- and gran ddaughter situ
ation, wh ich is ki
nd of interesting 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, I-I find fascinating the fact that
 my daughter is able
 to more objectively 
talk to my  mo ther about th
e Ho locaust than I am. In the last couple years, I have 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
32
evaded -- I will listen to my mother tell 
me whatever sh e wants to tell me, but I 
don™t want to dwell on it to the extent because -- and I have been the one who has 
been instigating my mother
 cutting back on her speaking engagements because I 
know emotionally what it takes out of he
r. And so I™m taking on the protective 
mo ther stance, saying, every time you go to
 another high school or university and 
give a talk, the nightmares come back, th
e memories come back, it takes a physical 
toll on you, I wish you wouldn™t do it. Yes,
 there is a need for these stories to be 
told, but I feel that my mo
ther has fulfilled her obligati
on to her family. And so I™m 
the one who says no to her. My  daughter
 is the one who does the research on her 
own. My mother tells my daughter, and we
 -- we both will sit th
ere and listen, but 
my -- it™s n o t that my daughter is not unaware
 of the emotional toll that it takes, but 
her insistence in knowing overrides someti
me s, her pulling back from asking just -- 
just one more question of my mother, while I will stop. 
Q: How old is she 
[indecipherable]
 
A: She just turned 22. 

Q: Maybe it™s harder at that age to -- to 
understand that too, wh
en  you yourself are 
so energetic and used to -- 
A: In the -- in the last -- I would say in
 the last two years, she has become mor e 
aware of my mother™s vulnerability and 
so in the first co
uple years when my 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin

33
daughter was at 
Duke
 University though
, she was responsible for bringing my  
mother out as a speaker fo
r the Holocaust, and it was very widely attended. And 
then my  daughter took a Holocaust studies
 class and had my  mo ther come out and 
speak specifically to the class 
as w ell as the rest of the 
university. And I think that 
sometimes her -- the mixture of pride and 
objective academic curiosity in wanting 
to know everything for herself is -- is he
r mo tivation. And I™m watching my mother 
get older, and weaker, and so it™s mu ch hard
er for me t-to go 
into those areas.  
Q: Do you -- do you feel that what™s call ed Ho locaust education now, or awareness 
of the -- of the Holocaust in th
is country, is going in the 
right direction, or is it still 
not -- not presented profound -- deeply e
nough, well enough, or is it at times 
overd one, or how -- how do you feel about wh at -- what™s happening -- 

A: Not having -- not having gone through 
a formal Holocaust education course, I 
know bits and pieces from my dau
ghter. The teacher that she had at 
Duke
 
Univ ersity was a graduate student who 
was making her life work doing Ho locaust 
studies. And she was very sensitive because 
Alexis
 was the only one in the class 
who had a survivor as a grandparen t. The 
other children came to it from an entirely 
different perspective. And 
so she would always say, 
Alexis
, you know, today is 
going to  be kind of tough, we™re going to
 watch this kind of footag e or examine 
this, you know, are you going to  be okay w
ith it. And my dau
ghter, 99 percent of

the time was able to stick it out. Whether it 
got to her later on in th e day, she was 
able to stay there for the duration. Ther
e was just one or two times where it just 
became overwhelming and she couldn™
t stay in the classroom. Sorry. 
Q: No, I wasn™t -- it sort of in general, 
just do you think th at sort of Holo caust 
education in this country is 
going in the right direction? 
Is there enough of it, too 
mu ch of it? Is it doing wh
at it should be doing? 
A: If it was going in the direc -- in the -- in 
the direction intended, then I think there 
would be a lessening of -- of ethnic cl
eansing and wars. Ob
viously it™s not 
achieving its ultimate goal, which is what
 the survivors, I think, who tell their 
stories, would wish. I think the -- their pur
pose in telling their stories is not only a 
testament to their survival, but also as gui
deposts to the future. So  we shouldn™t be 
seeing the pictures on the television th
at we™re watching on a daily basis. 
Q: I think this is a good time to stop.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
Shelly Sherwin
. This is tape number two, side
 A.
 Let™s come t o  sort 
of a -- a few issues that are potentially very
 large, but I would like to leave it up to 
you how mu ch you want to respond to it. A
nd the first question is, what kind of role 
does your Jewish identity or 
faith play in your life? 
A: I wouldn™t be anything else but Jewish, given a choice. I love being Jewish. I 
think being culturally Jewish is a tremendo
us part of my personality. I don™t know 
who I would be, or what I would be like if 
I wasn™t Jewish. I m
ean, it™s that much a 
part of my  psyche. And on the other 
hand, wh en it comes to pure religion and 
observance, I™m mo re observant than my
 mother. My husband and I made that 
determination when  we had our daughter, th
at we wanted religion to be a spiritual 
backbone. Not strict, not stri
ctly enforced, but certainly 
the spiritual foundation that 
it gives someone in terms of an identity. Th
at she would feel as comfortable in her 
skin being Jewish as I was, but I had the un
ique experience of growing up in a very 
Jewish community in 
New York
 
City
, so that™s why it™s also interwoven for me. 
And my husband grew up in a Jewish area in -- in 
Lo ndon
. But i -- but a -- a 
New 
York 
Jew is an entity unto itself. What you see 
on television is what I g -- is w h at -- 
is what my life was growing up. My -- 
my  daughter wh en she was going th rough

school -- it™s interestin g, in my parent
™s house they did not speak Yiddish . My 
mother™s family in 
Poland
 did not speak Yiddish because her mo ther™s side of the 
family was Sephardic and that was the -- 
obviously  the s -- the Spanish side, it was 
not -- it was the 
Ashkenazic 
that spoke Yiddish in the 
house. And I had a summer 
job once, wo rking fo r a doctor in  the 
Catskills
, and I picked up a tremendous 
amount of Yiddish, because it was with an el
derly Jewish clientele, and I brought up 
my daughter with these little Yiddish expr
essions. And she felt so comfortable in 

her Jewish skin, that she would routin ely 
use them in her compositions in school, 
and sometimes get comments on the t -- on th
e papers from the teacher saying, I 
don™t understand this word . So  I encouraged
 her creativity and said, if that™s the 
word  that best describes how you™re feeli
ng, then just put a f
ootnote at the bottom 
of the page, which is wh at she started doi
ng in grad e school. If -- if a Yiddish  word  
sufficed, she would use it, and then put a 
footnote in fo r those people who didn™t 
understand it. And so ev en when  we conver
se now, it™s not that either of us are 

fluent Yiddish speakers, but th -- there are certain expressions that we do use 
routinely. So that™s -- that™s where I fit in
 in terms of being cu
lturally how I identify 
myself, and in terms of personality. I cannot
 split where my Judaism leaves off and 
where the rest of me b egins. They™re -- they™re 
inextrictably
 entwined. Religiously 
is a different story. In -- in following th
e rituals, when my daughter was going to 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
37
Hebrew school in preparation fo r her 
Bat Mitzvah
 and my  husband and I started a 
temple with 18 other couples,
 it was an extraordinary life 
changing event to be in on 
the -- on the formation of a temple. I -- we 
never work ed  as hard, we never sat on as 
many committees, we never had 
so little free time as w e did, and yet we look upon 
that as the mo st golden period in our liv es because we did something really so 
constructive. But wh en it got down to  actua
lly being alone with 
my thoughts with 
God, it™s a love/h ate relationship. My mo th
er came out of the camp s questioning her 
faith. She will tell you now th at if she wa
s given a choice she wouldn™t come back 

Jewish. My father loves temple an d lo
ves being su rrounded by th ings that are 
familiar with him, he™s -- he™s -- he™s trad
itional and a little bit old-fashioned in that 
sense, he doesn™t like female cantors. He
 likes that good old solid, you know, 
Jan 

Pierce
 type of voice, that -- that brings him 
to his spiritual sati sfact i on. When I was 
diagnosed with cancer in -- breast cancer in
 aug -- in July, sorry
, in July, I had my 
surgery in  August, I didn't question why it ha
ppened to  me, and I wasn™t as angry at 
God as I have been about why my  mo ther
 had to suffer through the Holocaust. I 
could accept my fate more eas
ily  and hopefully with more 
grace than I™v
e ever been 
able to accept what happened to my mother
 and her family. And 
so when it -- when 
I think in terms of blind faith, I don™t ha
ve it. I know that Judaism is built upon 
equal parts of blind faith and questioning,
 so that you come to a -- a soulful 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
38
understanding of your relationship in -- in 
the world, and with God as a Jew. And 
yet, the Holo caust puts a -- a huge road
block that sometimes prevents me  from 
attaining more spiritual insight. I™ll never be
 able to get past that. Sometimes I have 
a very accusatory tone in my
 thoughts when my 
mother is suffering the way that she 
does. I never had a normal mo ther. I neve
r experienced a mo th
er without pain, 
without even the uns
poken kind of neuroses that 
the Holocaust caused her to 
develop in her personality. She is an inte
llectually brilliant free spirit, and yet the 
Holocaust harnessed her intelligence and imprisoned her in this 
failing, tortured 
body. And so I™ve been  very  angry at God for a long time.  

Q: I meant to ask you what
 impact did the Ho locaust have, or your mo ther™s 
experience, on you. And that, of course, is
 a major answer already, that you just 
gave. Is there anything else that you could ad
d to that if you think about, in terms of 
different perspectives on so mething. If 
you think about that experience, your 
mother™s experience on you, on your
 life, on your outlook on life. 
A: I™ve always tried to be the best daughter that I could so that 
A
, I wouldn™t cause 
my  mo ther any unhappiness or unnecessa
ry disappointment. Of course, you know, 

I™d be superwoman if I never disappoint
ed my mother. But I™v
e -- I™ve carried the 
weight of trying to keep my mother happy 
because of all the unhappiness in her life. 

It™s a tremendous burden. I feel that I pa
y for the Holocaust in many ways. Because 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
39
of what happened to my mo
ther, I live my life in a way 
that is encumbered by it, 
rather than being free to have experienced 
a mother who aged gracefully without all 
these extra layers of mental and physical
 pain that were artificially -- s-she was 
subjected to. Unnecessarily objected to -- s
ubjected to. It™s -- it™s -- it™s a -- I feel 
that -- I can™t say it any mo re strongly, I 
feel that I am paying for the Holo caust 
every single day. 

Q: Fr-From your perspective, is y our mo
th er paying fo r the Ho locaust every single 
day? Is she, however reluctant a little bit to 
-- to make too much of 
that in -- in -- in 
her public presentations and in terviews, 
maybe? Do you see -- how do you see that? 
A: For posterity, I will tell you, and I hope 
my mother will not hear this because it 
would bring her pain. My mother will not 
admit to the world at large -- terrible -- 
terrible an -- analogy, but what a -- what
 an overw helming cross she™s had to carry 
every day, every step, every time she puts 
on her iron brace in the morning, it™s the 
Holocaust coming back 
into her life again. Her coping 
system -- if -- if one of us 
has a cold, or the flu, or anything normal,
 it™s magnified 10 times because nothing is 
allowed to happen to her 
family any more, because ev
erything happened  to her 
family before. So h -- there™s no sense of 
normal perspective or proportion in what 
goes on in our lives. The joys are -- are 
tremendous, wonderful, sweet joys. What 
could be just a minor disa
ppointment, because her life is so limited now by her 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
40
physical limitations becomes magnified 
10 times more, because
 sh -- because she 
doesn ™t have the outlets that a physical 
life would allow he
r. And she has nothing 
left but this interior life.
 Everything is magnified.  
Q: How -- how does your father fit into all of this? 
A: My father doesn™t have the -- 
the -- there™s a -- there™s a more 
laissez faire 
quality to my father™s life. Things happen,
 and he can accept them. And my mother 
will feel more the injustice, or -- or -- or 
more protective, or -- I think that she feels 
that she paid with her fam
ily so dearly, that we should be spared. And my  father 

understands that nobody -- in -- in the norm
al run of life is spared from everything, 

and yet it -- it become so ta
xing. I mean, when I was diag
nosed with this, I was m -- 
we -- we carefully orchestrated an entire sc
enario around telling my mother that I™d 
been diagnosed with cance
r. I was more concerned telling my mother -- even 
though it was in the earliest 
stages, that it was entirely curable, that it was not going 
to affect my quality of life, I was more 
distraught in having to tell my mother, and 
that was one of the only times that I br
oke down. It was up to  my  husband an d my  
daughter and my  doctors, who are friends, wh
o sat and told my  mo ther. I was out of 
the house. I couldn™t physically be in th
e house because I thou
ght I™m bringing her 
more pain than she n
eeds. And I felt guilty. The cancer 
didn™t bother me as much as 
I knew that it was going to hurt my mother.

Q: Do you want to stop for a moment? We
 will stop for a moment. So we were just 
talking ab out how difficult it is to -- i-it wa
s to -- to let your mo th er know, and so 
that she wouldn™t worry too 
mu ch about your health, but 
is that also very difficult 
for you, not being able to 
-- do you have to censor a little
 bit what -- what -- what 
you are saying? 
A: By nature I™m very spon
taneous. My husband is the chess player, my  husband is 
the -- is the bridge player. My mother is 
an extraordin ary bridge player. That all 
involves strategy. That always know -- thos
e people have a talent for knowing when  
and where to say and do the right thing. I 
don™t have that particular capacity. So 
usually something happe
ns to me and it™ll come straight through me without a filter 
or -- or a censor. It™s not that I™ve tried to
 learn how to strategi
cally tell my mother 
things. It™s just that someti
mes now I spare her. And it™s not that I don™t want to be 
honest, it™s just that I don™t want to burden
 her. It™s -- it™s very different. There are 
things that she has to know
, that sometimes you ju st can™t sugarcoat. But there are 
times when I have wanted to be entirely 
candid at the mo ment that things were 

happening, and her responses were such th
at, oh, but I went through something so 
much worse. Or but, you know, if you™re da
ughter is unhappy at this age, where do 
you -- wh at do you think I felt when I was he
r age? So I can™t be 
involved in this 
kind of one-upsmanship and I can™t co
mpete, no one can compete with her

42
experiences in the Holocaust. And yet it™
s unfair to hold the Holocaust over my 
head as prev enting me from being entirely 
open with my mothe
r. So sometimes the 
easier route is just not to tell her everything
. It™s not that she™s not sympathetic, it™s 
just that, look what -- what -- what I went 
through, this is not a reason to co mp lain. 
And yet, everybody -- in everybody™s life 
there are things th
at happen on an 
everyday basis which are bothersome or ann
oying, or distressing.
 And no, they have 
no co mp arison, there is no relevance to th
e Holocaust. And yet, the Holocaust is 
used -- I don™t want to say as a battering 
ram, but as this stick that we have to 
measure our experiences against -- versus 
hers, and sh -- her -- she tops everything. 
I mean -- 

Q: Was there any patience then, with the 
trivial childhood probl
ems that one tends 
to have, like with yours? Was -- how did sh
e deal with that, when you were young, 
and -- 
A: She was much stronger 
when I was younger, the Holo
caust didn™t factor in m-
my  -- I went only once to a Second Generatio
n meeting, and I felt that it was one of 
these group hug type of 
California
 groups because some one stood up and said, if I 
came home from school with a grade that was 
less than stellar, my  mo ther would 
say, is that what I ho -- 
survived the Holoca
ust for? And I never experienced that, 
my mother never did that to me when I wa
s younger. I mean, if I failed a math test 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
43
it was because I was lazy. It had nothing 
to -- it had no reverberation, or -- or 
association to -- you know, 
you should have done better 
because of what I went 
through. And I didn™t want to have to 
live through these other people™s nightmares 
of wh at they went through with  their pa
rents, because I thought it would -- because 
my  childhood had been  so happy. My mo th
er was stronger when she was younger. 
It™s now that she™s older and becoming mo re
 fragile on so many different levels that 
the Holocaust is becoming a factor in da
ily life and conversation when we talk 
about normal experiences. But when I wasyounger, it just -- it wasn™t used as a 

motivation that some of these people had 
as their parents. And my mother didn™t 
have, or didn™t use me  as a buffer in real
 life when I was younger. Some of these 
people also say that their parents woul
d wake up with  nightma
res and th ey would 
have to comfort their parents, kind of almo
st like children of alcoholics that have to 
parent their -- their parents. And I didn
't  have that experience. I had wa -- 
considerin g what my  mo ther went through,
 I think I had an ex
traordinarily normal 
childhood, and it™s just change
d in the last co uple years. 
Q: Why did you go to Second 
Generation in the first place,
 was that -- was there, in 
spite of the experience afterward, sort
 of a genuine need  to maybe comp are 
experiences, or to even get advice, or 
to exch ange experien ces, or were you 
prompted  by somebody, or was it a -- a curiosity thing? 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
44
A: M-My mo ther had heard about it and sh
e wanted to  -- wanted me to go and see 
what it was all about. Because my bac
kground, my ch ildhood was so normal, I 
mean, you know, there aren™t normal chil
dhood groups. Nobody goes and seeks out 
a normal childhood group, so I -- I didn™t 
think that there was any particular reason 
driving me to go to a Second Generation gr
oup, be -- be -- because I -- and -- and I -
- it was borne out, my  speculation that th
ese kids didn™t have a normal childhood, 
and so th ey did need  a -- a support group,
 where they could sh
are what they went 
through. I probably need it now mo re th
an I did years -- then. But I™m more 
concerned with dealing -- being a mo ther ofa 22 year old, and being a mo ther to my  
mo ther who is 70 plus. So I™m in the middl
e right now, and don™t particularly feel 
that I have the time or the -- or the emoti
onal energy to go to 
one of those groups 
right now. And plus I™m -- plus dealing with
 the recovery from my
 surgery is pretty 
time consuming. 

Q: Did you ever want to go to -- did you ever go to  
Poland
? 
A: No. And it™s not that I didn™t want to. 
My husband™s a stick in the mud, and we 
didn™t leave the country until our 25
th
 anniversary when we
 went to visit our 
daughter in 
Italy
. But he™s always had this ext 
-- extraordinarily 
heavy work load 
that we just didn't do any international tr
avel and now after this -- this brush with  

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
45
the hint of mortality, we™ve made a promise 
that we will travel more extensively. So 
I don™t know if 
Poland
 is my first destination, but who knows? 
Q: What is your relationship to 
Israel
? Have you ever been there? 
A: I -- I was there when I was 19. And I™m
 -- I™m the one who is responsible for 
sending, not all of them, but many, many 
students on an international program 
that™s free for 10 days to 
Israel,
 that™s an extraordinary e
xperience. So I™m reliving 
the wonder of my  ninet 
-- when I was 19 an d went there and -- and having th e 
privilege of sending these young people there. 
Israel
 was part of that education th at 
my parents gave me when I was younger. I 
did it in a summer when I went to visit 
friends who I™d made in high school, from 
Swit zerla n d,
 and they lived in 
Istanbul
. 
And they  said, if you™re coming to 
Israel
, then you better stop in 
Turkey
 cause 
otherwise you never will, and 
they were right, I™d never --
 I never went back an d so 
I got to see 
Turkey
, I stayed with them for thre
e weeks and then I went to 
Israel
 for 
three weeks. 

Q: I seem to recall that your mother said
 that your daughter has a very special 
relationship to 
Israel.
 Has she been there many tim
es? Or do I recall it wrong? 
A: No, no, she was there on the very
 first trip, this exa -- this hello
 Israel 
birthright 
trip that I™m talking about, 
she was sele cted to go from
 Duke 
University on their 
inaugural trip, it was over the millennium. And you do everything from 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
46
archaeological digs to climbing 
Masa da
 at dawn, to camel rides and 
Bedouin 
dinners, to floating in th e 
Dead Sea
, to meeting with Palestin
ian leaders. It™s a very 
cerebral and spiritual experience. There is 
no emphasis placed on religion itself, it™s 
just that the reasoning behind this trip
, there are three multibillionaires who are 
underwriting the cost of sending 50
,000 students internationally to 
Israel
 free for 10 
days. And they just felt that this 
generation didn™t have the bond with  
Israel
 that my 
generation and my  parent
™s generation had. So they ™re tr
ying, in hopes to foster this 
type of link with 
Israel, 
and it™s working. 
Q: What kind of relationship 
does your husband have to yo
ur parents? Or -- an d to 
your mo ther? 
A: Well, my mother wishes that my hus
band would speak mo re. But after 27 years 
of marriage she should know
 better. The -- if you don™t 
ask my  husband something 
in question form, you™re not going to 
get an answer. But my hu -- I think my 
husband is a wonderful son-in-law. He care
s deeply about my 
mother™s welfare, 
both mentally and -- and phys
ically, and is very solicitous of her. And fo r as 
emotional as an Englishman can be, he tries,
 he tries really hard. He™s -- the greatest 
thing that my  husband ever did was in
tro duce my  mo th er 
to the computer. 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
47
Q: Oh, I have to talk to her about that. Is
 there anything else that you would like to 
say to -- to round this out that I haven™t as
ked, or that -- that came up in  the process 
that you would like to so rt of say? 
A: I hope a Holo caust never happens again,
 not only for the peop
le who are directly 
involved, but for their descenda
nts. There is such a lingeri
ng affect of this kind of 
devastation. It manifests on so many differe
nt levels. It affects the way people react 
to each other. I wish that lessons could be
 learned from the Holocaust. I wish that 
people who are in my position could also 
affect a change, but sometimes you™re so 
busy dealing with th e victims, that you don™t 
have time to take care of the rest of the 
world. I try on a small basis to interact w
ith my peers on an international basis. And 
yet, I would be less than human and less th
an my  mo ther™s daughter if I didn™t say 
that her experience has shaped
 my world view. I try -- I try on a daily basis to be a 
better person. Sometimes I succeed and some
times I™m not as forgiving as the ideal. 
Q: Okay , well, thank you very 
much for the interview. This
 is the end of tape two, 
side 
A
 interview with 
Shelly Sher -- Sher -- 
I™m sorry. 
Shelly Sherwin,
 thank you. 
I would like to just follow 
up one more time, so this
 was not the end of the 
interview. I forgot to ask 
what your profession is righ
t now. You™re working at a 
college, university? 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
48
A: I work at a community college, 
Santa Monica
 College. I™m the 
Hillel 
director, 
which is the Jewish student group, and cr
eate a program of activities, everything 
from virtual bowling to  having intellectual,
 philosophical, ridiculous conversations. 
Activit -- all kinds of activities. T h ese ar
e college students and they™re looking to  
have fun and they™re looking to  bond with th
eir peers, and so I™ve been doing that 
for 10 years. And -- 

Q: You like teaching? 
A: I like being the boss. And th e other thi
ng that keeps me very busy, because I do 
love writing, I -- and I™ve -- I™ve free-lanced
 on a book, and I just enjoy the process 
of writing, is that I have a business w
ith a partner for college admissions, we™re 
college counselors. And I wo
rk  both with high school 
students and then college 
graduates on their admission application essays. We help  them from the entire 
creative process of formulating their ideas to
 the finished produc
t of the essays. So 
it™s a very creative and involving and so
metimes nerve-wracking process, waiting 
for those acceptance letters to come. But 
it -- it keeps me very involved with 
students from high school age th ro ugh grad uate school students. 

Q: So of course now I have
 one very last question. Wh
at are your hobbies, what do 
you do fo r fun when  you ha
ve time to have fun? 
A: Let™s see, does -- does eating 
chocolate count as a hobby? 

 
Interview with Shelly 
Rothschild-Sherwin 
March 15, 2001 
 

 
 
49
Q: Yes, it does. 
A: Okay . 

Q: No, it doesn™t actually, but -- that™s
 a preference, that™s a fun thing. 
A: Okay, well theater certainly is a priority
. Since we had the chance to travel two 
years ago to 
Italy
 when  my  daughter was doing a st
udy abroad, that 
re-sparked my 
wanderlust, which I had before I married my
 husband, and he has promised that he 
will take off some time a
nd we™re going to go back to 
Euro pe
 again. Museum trips 
are still a -- a very constant feature of life here in 
Los Angeles. 
Reading, I™m a great 
reader, I always have. Music, 
I -- I keep a little bit of my 
youth in my tastes with -- 
still listening to the 
Beatles,
 but I find that classical musi
c is more satisfying now as 
I™m getting older, especially driving in  
LA 
traffic. And love my  dog.  
Q: All right. And this is the ve
ry end now of tape two, side
