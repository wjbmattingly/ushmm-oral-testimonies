Interview with NormanSalsitz 
July 5, 1999 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, 
this is an interview with No rman Salsitz, c
onducted by Regina Baier, 
on July fifth, 1999, 
in Mr. Salsitz™s home. This is a follow up 
interview to a USHMM 
videotaped interview 
conducted by -- with Norman Salsitz on May 12
th
, 1990. The United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum gratefully acknowled
ges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this 
interview possible. This is tape numb er one, 
side A. So -- any my 
first question would be 
when  were you born, and where? 
Answer: I was born May the sixth, 1920, in 
a small to wn in Pola
nd, southern Po land, 
named Ko lbushova. And th is -- people think 
that this -- well, this was known as 
Galeetsia, b ecause before 1918, this belonged 
to Austria, and now as a section of Poland 
was called Galeetsia, so there where I was 
born. Then it became Poland, and it -- the 
section was called min o r Poland. So, it was a 
very small town . It -- the town  had 4,000 
people, and from the 4,000 peop le, 2,000 were Jews, and 2,000
 were Poles -- Catholics. 
We only had Catholics in our s
ection. Protestants, we didn™t
 have any Protestants there, 
so all Jews, or Catholics. 

Q: And Norman, you have diffe
rent names. One name you 
were born with, a name -- 
certain -- several names that you used during 
th e war, and a name now. Could you give 

us first, all of these names?

A: Yes. I can give you the names, because so
metimes w h en I -- on th
e street, or when I 
am in New York, and there are people who call me when they see 
me, and they call me 
different names, and I know from th -- wh
ere they know me. Well n o w -- will tell you th e 
-- the names. So for -- I was born as Naftali 
S alishitz. Salishitz was like -- is pronounced 
as a ger -- German name, because we were in 
Austria, with a u -- umlaut, and this how I 
was born. In the war, I became the first one th
at it was changed. It 
was Tadosh Yadduch. 
Tadosh Yadduch is when I jo
in ed the Po lish undergro und,
 the AK, which is the home 
army , and in Po lish it™s armia kryova. They  di
dn™t accept Jews, so I had to get some 
papers, and I masqueraded as a Polish Catholic, 
and with my  papers, my  birth certificate, 
which we will talk about it later, was Tadosh Yadduch, so my name was -- this was the 
name, and also, my  friends called me Taddek.
 This is from Tadosh, is Taddek. So for 
this, if I hear somebody calls 
me Taddek, so I kn
ow they know me fro
m this town. Then 
my name was, when I was there, so my 
name was -- became, in one part, it became 
Lazerosh Spillman. I had to do a certain job, a
nd I had to be a German, so I had a friend, 
his name was Lazerosh Spillman, I took his na
me, and -- and this was for a short time, 
because Spillman is G erman, Lazerosh [indec
ipherable]. Then I wer -- I -- my name 
became Anatoli Sherberkof. Anatoli Sherberkof 
is when I joined th
e r -- Russian group, 
and there were Russians, and again I had to  mas
querade as a -- as a -- as a Russian, so my 
name was Anatoli Sherberkof. Th
en when I -- after the war, af
ter I was liberated, I joined 
the Polish army . I volunteered for the Polish army , and my  name became Tadosh 

Szaleski, because Tadosh, I liked
 the name, and Szaleski is 
because it™s a very -- it™s a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052

nice, Polish name, with the s-k-i in the end. 
And th is -- I used this name during my  time 
in the Po lish army , which I had a very, very  im
portant position, until I escaped. Also -- so 
now, when I see a person calls
 me Taddek, and so I know
 from where. And calls me 
Naftali, so I know he knows me from hom
e. And then, my name was -- I was called 
Lotchik. Lotchik in Russian mean s a pilot,
 because when I joined the army, I w as 
accepted to the air force, and everybody e
nvied me, because very few people were 
accepted to the air force. So 
in po -- Russian is called Lo
tchik, so people called me 
Lotchik. No w ev en today, wh en  I see some fr
iends from this time, they say, ﬁOh, Lotchik 
is calling.ﬂ Yeah. And then 
when I came to America -- so
 I changed my  name from 
Naftali, because I came to America on my real
 name Naftali Salishitz. So I changed my 
name to Norman Salsitz, because my family
 thought that this is
 a -- all my family 
changed their names, and I pick ed  out Salsitz
, and nor -- and there is a whole story about 
-- about how I would change, but 
this is not for now. I have the story in my  ne -- coming 
book how my  name was changed.
 So I remained with na -- w
ith Norman Salsitz, and this 
how I am today. 
Q: We™ll talk about that story 
a little bit later actually, on th
e tape, too, but let me ask you 
this, who was Naftali? 

A: Now -- 

Q: Who wa -- who was the man that the -- th
at they would rememb er, and who was the 
boy, or th e young man that you rememb er? 

A: Well, you want to know why I™m named Naftali? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052

Q: No, I wanted -- I wanted to 
know what your dr -- what yo
u™re dreams were, that wa -- 
A: Oh. 
Q: -- who were you at that
 time, as a young person? 
A: Well, Naftali -- I was the youngest in my
 family, which means all my sis -- I had five 
sisters. My fif -- sisters were older, and I was 
very, very  spoiled, because all of them, as a 
matter of fact, til I was three, four years, one 
sister, which I liked ve
ry much -- I liked all 
of them -- I called her mama til 
I was four years old. They ac
tually raised me, because my 
mo ther had nine children, so it was very hard 
for her. We lived in one room in this time, 
and there was -- I was born after the war. So I 
was very spoiled. And then later, nothing 
was impossible for me, because the family al
lowed me for a lot of things. And later, 
when I was older, I was not an angel. I did cer
tain things that my father didn™t like. 
Naturally, I didn™t do bad things, but I was -- 
I was a re -- always 
I was a rebel. And I 
always, if I -- I always reached higher, that
 my -- my kind of pe
ople, or my family 
expected, especial later, when I started 
to go out with the girl of my  dreams, 
[indecipherable]. I always wanted something 
higher, and I -- in school, I was a very -- I 
was, in my class in the public school, I wa
s always the best student. And I have all my  
report cards. I have the report cards from the fi
rst grade to the last grade, I saved them, 
together with my photos. And I ver -- it wa
s very unusual for a 
Jewish boy, who had 
sidelocks, and was reli -- and was dressed as 
a -- as a Hassidic boy, to have good report 
cards, because the teachers all were Poles -- 
Catholics, there was not a Jewish teacher, 
and they all hated Jews. Because I would say 
-- oh, maybe it™s not the right expression, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
6
 
 
 
but I would say 95 percent they hated Jews, 
and especial they hated a Jew who was a 
religious Jew. We were different. So -- to -- fo
r a Jew like this, to get a report card with -- 
from top to bottom excellent, it was very unusua
l, but I have the report cards. Now, I 
went also to a Jewish school, we called it 
Yeshiva -- Chadda -- or
 Yeshiva, where we 
learn Jewish subjects. Now, I was not so good
 there, and my father always -- always ask 
questions. ﬁHow comes in the Polish school 
you are the best, and here you are not such  a 
good student?ﬂ Well, I didn™t have so mu ch inte
rest in it. I had interest in geography, in 
history. Even today, so many 
years later, if y ou will ask me -- there was the river Vistula 
in Poland, which was the ma
in river. And the main river had so many small rivers 
running into the main river, to
 ma ke it a bigger river. And it started in the Carpathian 
mountains, and it ended in the Baltic Sea, in 
Danzig. So I can today 
mention all the rivers 
who fell in from the Carpathian mountains to 
the Vistula, the left and th e right side. I 
remember it, because I was very
 interested in it. Poland ha
d 40 kings, and if you will ask 
me, I will mention all the 40 ki
ngs, when they became kings, 
when they died
. I remember 
those things, because I had an
 interest in this. And -- 
Q: Tell me two. 
A: Two? 
Q: Just as a  test.  

A: Well, I would -- I would tell you, just as a 
test, I will tell you the first and the last one. 
Maybe this will be the [indeci
pherable]. The first one was Meershko Peervsha. It means 
me -- his name was Meershko, and he was th
e originator of the Po lish kingdom, before 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
7
 
 
 
Poland didn™t have a kingdom
, didn™t have a country, ther
e were tribes. And Meershko 
Peervsha was the first king, and he was al
so important, because in 966, he accepted 
Christianity for the Polish 
people. So 966 was very impor
tant. And the last one was 
Zigmund Au gust Po rniatofsky. He was the last king, th e 40
th
 king. So, h-he -- the -- 
Zigmund Au gust Po rniatofsky, there are rumo rs
 about him, that he was a lover of the 
Russian, and -- the czarina, and then -- and Po
land didn™t like it so 
much. Well, so those 
things were very important for me. Like, for 
instance, the mountains in Poland, th e rivers 
in Poland, I remember it, becau
se I loved it. So for this reason, I was a very good student. 
Q: Wh-W hy did you love it so mu ch
? What was so important to you? 
A: I loved it for -- for a few reasons. The fi
rst thing it was to me
 -- w h en I lived in 

Poland, I considered myse
lf a Pole, a patriot. I say, we live
 in this country -- Jews lived in 
Poland fo r a thousand years. My town  exis
ted since 1773. So  it me ans oma -- over two 
hun -- 200 years. So I always said, if I live in
 a country, I -- this is
 my country. Naturally, 
in this time -- and so I loved it, and I love
d ev erything, and also literature. If you will ask 
me about Polish writers, and Polish literature
 -- literature, I remember important poems. 
And -- and I -- I liked it. Where 
the Jewish learning, I did it because my  father wanted me 
to do it. I was proud to be a Jew, but I wa
nted to show, because 
I lived in Poland, and 
because the peep -- 
Polish people didn™t like us, so I 
wanted to show that I am a good 
Pole. And so  was my father. My father was, 
I would say, the bigges
t Polish patriot in our 
town. He was a Jew with the lo
ng beard, and -- and very  relig
ious, very learned, but he 
was one of the few who spoke Po lish beautiful
. He spoke Polish with out a Jewish accent, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
8
 
 
 
correct grammar, ever -- he spoke -- now, as a 
matter of fact, if sometimes they had to 
send a delegation to  the Polish peep -- to the go
vernment or something, my  father went as 
a spokesman, because on account of his lan
guage. And when there were some national 
holid ays or something, my  sp
 -- father spoke about -- spok
e, because it was unusual to 
see a Jew with a long, gray beard speak Po
lish. Now, there was a reason why he spoke 
good Polish, and if later -- if you will have 
time, I will tell you th e reasons. So I li -- now, 
for instance, there was a peas
ant movement in Poland, whic
h 90 -- I would say 75 percent 
of the population were peasants
. And th ey were not very  well 
off before the war. They -- 
the government didn™t treat them very righ
t, because where -- because the government 
was run by the nobility, and by 
people who were educated, and 
the peasants didn™t have a 
chance. Now, my father was the only Jew in our
 town  that he belonged to this movement. 
And when the peasants used to
 make gatherings in our town, wh ich th e government was 
against it, and th e thousands of thousands of 
peasants came to the marketplace to speak 

about the unjustice, what the 
government is doing ag ainst the 
Poles, against the peasants, 
all the meetings, everything was done in our 
house. Now, he did it 
because he believed in 
it, and also he did business with the peas
ants. Our business -- he had the wholesale 
grocery store, and the wholesale -- the groc
ery store was not a grocery, it was like in 
America you have a general store; we sold ever
ything. We sold in a -- grease for wagons, 
and we sold kerosene, and we sold flour -- wi
 -- everything was in our store. So the small 
stores in the villages came to buy by us, becau
se we were the wholesaler. And so this 
way he had the contact with the people. Also
, he had the contact because he was born in  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
9
 
 
 
that village. He was born in that village in
 1882, in a village called Dubass, which is 
about five kilometer from Kolbushova. His fa
ther was the manager of the village. Now, I 
want you should know 
that a village isna -- wasn™t lik
e it™s now, which is everybody land 
-- owned land. A village belong
ed to one person. In old -- 
it was a serfdom, it was a -- so 
then the -- all the people work
ed for this person, and my 
grandfather was the manager. 
When to cut, when to
 gather, when to sell, he was th
e ma nager. And in Poland he had -- 
in Polish he had a special name, they called 
him Veeairnick. Veeairnick in Poland means 
a man -- a trust -- a tru stee. It means that 
you believed him. So 
the man who owned the 
village trusted him, and he was managing, an
d naturally the profit we
nt to the owner. So 
maybe this is the reaso n  my father had a little
 connection to the land,
 to the people, and 
naturally, they didn™t reciprocat
e, they didn™t pay him back th
at they loved him, because -
- maybe they liked him, but they  di
dn™t love him because he was a Jew. 
Q: So you gave us a little b
it of an understanding of wh
ere you came from, and who you 
were when you were called Naftali. Who we
re you as a person wh
en you were Taddek, 
and -- was it Lotchik? 
A: No, no. Taddek Yadduch. 
Q: Not [indecipherable] 
A: Taddek  Yadduch. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Taddek. This was -- 
Q: Or Tadosh when  you had the other -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
10
 
 
 
A: -- Tadosh, right. 
Q: -- the other identity. 
A: Tadosh I became, is after I went throu
gh -- the Germans came in  -- after I went 
through the ghetto. I went through three camp
s, from which I escaped, and I went in to 
the underg round, to the woods. We had a Jewish
 group. In our Jewish
 group, we had 120 
-- this is a long story -- we -- I describe 
it in my books. We ha
d 125 members in our 
group, Jews. We started to get arms, guns, and th en later, I was shot by my  -- one of my  
best friends, he shot me four times, three 
bullets entered my  neck. And th is was a man 
who was the head of this Polish underground
, AK, armia kryova, the home army. And he 
was a friend, we went to school together. 
Bu t nevertheless, I was a Jew, and th e armia 
kryova, the home army didn™t accept Jews, a
nd when  I came to him that he should 
incorporate my group -- because later I b
ecame the commandant of
 my Jewish group. 
Now, we had -- the highest number of our gr
oup was 125, but in this time we had about 

69, because we started to be killed, killed, 
killed. Not by Germans, 
we were mostly killed 
by Poles. So when I saw that we
 are being killed, and I find out 
that he is the leader, so I, 
through messengers I sent him, 
I want to have a me eting w
ith him, and when  I had the 
meeting, I offered that we have al-almost 70 
people, young people, and we want to join  

his group, and I even  to ld him that he can use 
us to the most danger
ous -- [clock chiming] 
Q: That™s the clock here
 in the room, but -- 
A: So -- so he can use us to
 the mo st dangerous actions, because we didn™t have for to 
lose. But we would be pro-protected from th
is Polish underground. So I figured because 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
11
 
 
 
he was my schoolmate, and he™s the leader, so
 I will have a chance that he will accept us. 
And we -- this is also a long story, I have 
it in the book, and we had the first meeting. 
When  we had the meeting, he shot me from be
hind, he shot me fo -- his brother, actually, 
with him together. They shot me four times
. Three bullet entered 
my neck , one in my 
hand, I fell down, that I™m -- and I was sure th
at I would be dead, that I am dead, I felt 
dizzy. And -- and -- so then, wh
en I came -- when I -- the -- 
Q: Bird is singing [indecipherable] 
A: So -- so, okay? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So -- so when I came -- a
nd so when  I came to him, I had already a false document 
which I got from a mo nsignor, and my  name 
became -- a-a-again -- after -- now, people 
ask, ﬁYou were shot, so what happened?ﬂ 
I said, ﬁWell, I was not dead, otherwise I 
wouldn™t be here.ﬂ So, but I killed him. Layi
ng on the floor, I shot him, and his brother, 
and then  later I knew I cannot be any mo re wi
th my  group, because th
ey started to look 
for my group, and they -- and I thought my 
group would suffer on account of me, because 
they knew I did it. So I went to a differe
nt section, and I became a member of this 
organization with my  name
 as Tadosh Yadduch.  
Q: You were a changed man at that time? 
A: Changed in what? In what -- in what way? 
Q: In the way you felt about things. Revenge 
seems to have become an important theme 
at this point. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
12
 
 
 
A: Yes, yes. Revenge was very important 
for me, and the revenge was important for a 
few reasons, but the main reason was, when
 my father was shot
 in the ghetto, the 28
th
 of 
April, 1942, I witnessed it. And 
wh en he was shot by the Gesta
po, before he died , he said 
what a Jew usually says before he dies, Go
d is [indecipherable], we call it the shema 
Israel. And then he said -- 
the last word s were, ﬁNakuma, nakuma, nem nakuma.ﬂ It 
means, revenge, revenge, take 
revenge. Now, he said it in su
ch a voice, that it was not a 
natural voice, it was something that it came 
from heaven, an unnatural voice, which I -- 
til today, it is already almost 70 years, I can 
still hear his voice yelling to take revenge. 
And this gave me stren g th to su rvive. I said
, ﬁI must survive to ta
ke revenge.ﬂ For this 
reason, revenge was so important for me. So
me people say so what is revenge? Revenge 
is nothing. Not for me, ben wh en  you started to
 think, everyone wh o has a family, and if 
he would started to think that
 all his family were killed by 
certain people, and they were 
not only killed, before they we
re killed, they were tortured. Hunger, beating, starvation, 
and then finally killed, and you will say, ﬁW e
ll, if I can get these men, I am going to kill 
them.ﬂ Sure now, in 1999, you don™t think 
ab out it, because we are normal people, la -- 
we live in America. B u t in this time, the only 
dream I had is to take revenge. And for this 
reason, revenge was so important. Only -- also, 
this was my father™s 
-- the legacy what I 
got from my father. Also, revenge was important, 
I had five sisters.  My five sisters were 
married. They had little children. I was very cl
ose to the children, we
 lived together. And 
when I started to think, there™s a little girl
, her name was Blimcha, she was three and a 
half years. She was like an angel,
 with gold curled hairs. And 
if I start to think that this 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
13
 
 
 
girl had to be killed, and the 
others, I had 21 peop
le. Why were they killed? For no -- not 
because they were bad, they 
were killed just because they 
were Jews. And if I survived, 
and if I wouldn™t take -- I was the only survi
vor, and maybe if they are in heaven, I don™t 
know, they would s -- or -- or 
before they were killed, they
 knew, because I always was 
the one who went down  from the ghetto, brou
ght food, and brought them candy. And if 
they would be killed, they 
would say, ﬁWell, Naftali w
ill take care on it.ﬂ And they 
probably thought about it, that I w ould take
 care on it. If they are in  heaven, which I 
don™t know if they are, this is a different st
ory, if they are, and if they look down , and 
they said -- and they  looked at me and said
, I was the survivor, th
e survivor to  take 
revenge, and if wouldn™t take revenge, I will be a traitor, I would be a disappointment for 

them, because I was the only 
one. So I had to ta
ke revenge. Now, after the war, after I 
came to America, I still take revenge. But I can
not go out, take bodily revenge, physical 
revenge. So my revenge is that
 I survived the war to
 tell the story, to tell the cruelties, to 
tell the murdering things. This is my reveng
e, and maybe this is the reason I survived. 
Otherwise, why did I surviv e, why not the ot
her people? But this is the reason that I 
survived . In the war it was a physical reveng
e. Now th e revenge is, like I™m speaking to  
you, I give other testimonies, I go to school
s. I go -- people ask me -- if some body asked 
me to speak about the Holo caust,
 I am always ready. I never took a penny, people want to 
pay me, I said, ﬁNo, this is not a thing that I wa
nt to get paid.ﬂ Y -- I 
have to do it, so long 
as I am aliv e, because in a few years there 
will not be survivors. And who knows? If now 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
14
 
 
 
we have deniers, where we are still alive, what
 will be a few years late
r? So my duty is to 
tell and retell the cruelties. To tell the storie
s, because I was a witn
ess. I was the re.  
Q: We will talk about that mo
re, about your work, your legacy
, a little later. Let me just 
ask you this, in your videotaped  interview, 
you also gave another 
reason that might have 
helped you to -- to
 get through this. 
A: Yes. 
Q: A letter from your -- from your mo ther. 

A: See, well people ask me -- everybody had 
a reason why he surviv ed, had a legacy. I 
had two legacies, and I said I must survive. 
The first legacy was th
at my father said 
revenge, revenge, reven -- this I said, I must
 live to take revenge, because if -- if my 
father is in heaven , as we believe, how would 
I be able to face him, h e ask me, ﬁDid you 
do so mething, did you take re
venge because they shot me?ﬂ I did. Maybe I didn™t take 
enough revenge, looking back, I didn™t take en
ough, but I did. The second legacy was 
wh en  my  mo th er was tak en  
from the town of Jh
eshuf, from the ghetto, cause we were 
taken from Kolbushova, from a small town to
 a larger town, to Jheshuf, where they 
gathered more Jews, to be able to send them
 to a death camp . And when  she was taken to 
Belzyce, to the death camp, with all her five
 sis -- daughters, with the son-in-law s, with 
her grandchildren, somehow she gave someb
ody a letter. She could give a letter, and I 
was on th is time in a camp , and they brough
t the letter to me. And I reme mb er -- I don™t 
have the letter, I would give everything to 
have the letter, but I don™t have it. But I 
remember the words. And she wrote to me, ﬁY
ou are the youngest of my  nine children, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052

and you know always
 the youngest is the smartest, ﬂ in
 t h eir eyes. ﬁYou are young, you 
are strong, you are smart. You go and surv
ive the war, because af
ter the war, you go to 
America, and tell to El,ﬂ I had a brother alr
eady in America. ﬁTell to El,ﬂ his name was 
El, ﬁwhat the murderers did to 
us. Go to Palestine.ﬂ I had a 
brother in Palestine, David. 
ﬁGo to David, and tell him what the mu rderer
s did to us. Go to th e world, and tell the 
world what the murderers did to us.ﬂ She se --
 she also wrote, ﬁLet your bein g an orphan  
not break you. Go out, 
fight, be strong, and survive.ﬂ Th
is gave me a o-other s -- reason 
to survive, and for this reas
on, from the first minute when 
I was liberated, when people 
didn™t want to tell stories about the Holocaus
t, from the first minute, I spoke. People, in 
the beginning, didn™t like it. They
 looked at me and 
they saw this is an
 obsession, that I 
speak about the Holocaust, but I spoke. Peopl
e who surviv ed, they  didn™t want to speak. 
It took a long time til they started to speak 
in the 60™s and the 70™s. I spoke ab out the 
Holo caust in ™45, and ™46, but
 people didn™t want to liste
n. When I came to America, 
when I told the people, they th
ought I™m crazy. They
 didn™t want to listen. This was the 
legacy from my mother. So thos
e two legacies were the most 
important thing. It wasn™t 
important that if I am alive, and not alive.
 So other men will s -- survive. I never -- I 
never thought that being alive was such an im
portant thing as a personal thing, that I am 
alive. But a pers -- the important thing were
 those two legacies that I could fulfill. 
Q: Maybe we should flip the tape
 over at this point. So this is

End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview 
with Norman Salsitz. This is ta
pe number one, side B. I woul
d like you to -- to go back to  
the time just before liberation. When -- when
 was that, where were you, and what kinds 
of state of mind, and physical health were y
ou in at that time? J-Just before liberation, 
wherever you want to go. 
A: Well, before liberation -- this was in July
, 1944. Now, we were left from 125 Jews -- 
I™m not talking about the town
, the town was gone. The to
wn was liquidated July the 
seventh, 1942, they were take
n to Jheshuf, and Jheshuf to Be
lzyce, they were killed. But 
then later on we get some people togeth er, 
and finally we were 125, and from the 125 
they started to kill us, and 
mostly Polish people killed us. 
And in the book I describe 
there some raids they made on 
us. And in -- in July ™44, 
we were left only six people 
from the whole group. 

Q: Who were they?  

A: The six people -- this was -- I was there 
with my  brother, my  older brother Lyeb ish. 
He was 16 years older. Then  were two brot
hers, Lybovitch. One was Lyba, and one was 
Herschel. And the Lyba actually
, if not Lyba, we wouldn™t surviv e, because he was a 
village Jew, and his profession was he was a 
trapper before the war, and he knew the 
woods. And I described wh at things -- he liv
ed l-like a woodsman, and to me he -- his -- 
his -- he was like a -- a deer. He was -- he wa
s like -- lik e a animal. 
Not an animal in a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
17
 
 
 
bad sense, but he knew  all t
hose things, h-he could [indec
ipherable]. So, on account of 
him, we could surv ive. And his older brother 
was with him, so there were Lyba and his 
brother, I and my  bro -- and there were tw
o from my town. One wa
s Lyeb ish Nestel, one 
was Connor. And th e -- and the tw o were cousin
s, and they survived 
with us all the war. 
So happens that they 
were -- the -- the other one was 
Naftali Connor. And they were 
religious Jews. During all the 
time when we were -- they were
 with me in the ghetto, they 
were with me in the ca
mp, they were with me
 in the woods. And dur
ing all the time, they 
didn™t eat anything that it was not kosher -- it 
means it w as not for Jews
. So they only ate 
a piece of bread, some fruit, vegetables if they
 had. If we had meat, they wouldn™t eat it. 
If we killed a deer, or we killed a rabbit, they
 wouldn™t eat it. But 
anyway, they
 survived. 
And after, when they -- the -- wh
en -- when we were liberated 
in -- in the end of July, so 
they said, ﬁWe -- we are liber
ated. No more Germans. We
 are going home.ﬂ And they  
thought they would come home,
 they will be look
ed on like on heroes
. They survived 
from the whole war -- Jewish community. And 
they came home to my town three days 
after they were liberated, this Polish AK, th
e Polish underground, to
ok them, they wer -- 
they saw them. And they took 
them, and they shot them. Af
ter going through hell, losing 
their family , starving, everything, they we
re killed. And they were killed by very 
prominen t people, not peasants. By two peopl
e -- and I know the people who killed them. 
One, his name was Vladiswav Kishel. He wa
s before the war, dir -- director of the 
internal revenue in -- in Kolb
ushova, for te -- the text dire
ctor. Intelligent person. The 
second one was Jellinsky. Jellinsky had a bus co
mpany in our town. He lived all his life 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
18
 
 
 
with Jews, because the Jews
 were traveling in the bus
. They belonged to this 
organization. This organization 
took over the leadership for th
e first few days, before the 
Russians organized their own leadership. And they saw the two Je
ws, and they killed 
them. From the whole group, so we were
 left only six. Now, I -- I ga -- 
Q: How -- how did you hear about that? 
A: Well, I heard it right away, 
because when they went -- came to our town, they -- I told 
them not to go, because I kne
w that nothing good -- because 
they killed so many during 
the war, and when they went 
there -- then later, the Polish 
people between themselves, 
everybody knew about it, because this was not 
done in secret. They
 took them openly, 
and they  took th em to the river by the ce
metery, and they shot them. And -- and the 
people who were in my -- in 
our town, they told 
me this [indecipherable] not only one, a 
few of them. There were some people who we
re very sympathetic, and they told me. 
Now, the reason, later -- and I wrote this in
 my  book, and naturally the people are very 
angry in -- in my  town why I wrote it about it, and they  said to me, ﬁYou shouldn™t have 
write it, because in case this book will be -- w
ill be translated into 
Polish, this Kishel 
has,ﬂ -- he™s now 85 years, he lives in 
the town, he had grandchildren. So th e 
grandchildren will find out that their gra
ndfather was a murderer. So I shouldn™t -- I 
should retract it, I should write 
a article that is not true. They
 said he killed doesn™t mean 
anything, but the children shoul
dn™t know that he was a mu rd
erer. This what they wrote 
to me when the book came out. Now, I fou
nd out -- the reason why, which I understand, 
the reason why -- why in this Kishel, who was 
the director of the internal revenue, he 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
19
 
 
 
volunteered he should kill them
, because there were the group of the ar -- of the AK 
members, and when they cau
ght the two Jews, he voluntee
red to kill them. Now, why 
should he volunteer to
 kill them? The -- the --
 the -- the reason was that this one of them, 
Lyeb ish Nestel, he was such a nice person,
 a scholar. You see, both of them were 
rabbinical students, they were
 very intelligent people. So 
before the war, when the war 
blew out, he was in the active Polish army, a
nd his unit, his regiment was sent over to the 
German border, because they had to protect 
Poland. And he was, and he was a very good 
soldier. Now, also Kishel, the director of the internal revenue was in the reserve, he was 
an officer. And he was also in the same un
it. And when the Germ
ans attacked Poland, 
naturally the units started to pull back. And 
they came to a small 
town in -- near the 
German border, near Katovitz. And this was -- mostly there were Jews, so the Kishel 

knew this Lyebish Nestel, so he said to him,
 ﬁWell, why don™t you go to the Jews, where 
you are a Jew, and get two Hassidic coats 
[in d ecipherable], and 
we will change our 
uniform, and we will go home.ﬂ To change as 
being Jews. This what he told to Lyebish 
Nestel. So Lyebish Nestel said to him -- a
nd this was his officer -- and a Po lish guy, a 

patriot. So Lyebish Nestel told
 him, ﬁI will not do it. I am
 in the army. I came here to 
protect my  country, to fight for my  country . 
I wouldn™t do it.ﬂ Kishel looked at him, and 
that™s -- this was it. T w o days later, Kish
el disappeared. He didn™t know what a -- 
probably he did it on his own, 
he run away. Lyebish Nestel wa
s fig h ting, fighting, til they 
came near Lublin. This was de
ep into the Polish
 countryside, and he was taken as a 
prisoner by the Germans, as a 
soldier. Somehow, usually if Je
ws were taken as prisoners, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
20
 
 
 
they didn™t survive,
 because the Germans 
killed them. Somehow he run away. He run 
away, he came to our town, an
d he told everybody the story.
 He told the story how is it 
possible that Kishel -- and Kish el disappear
ed , nobody knew wh ere he is -- where he was. 
Naturally, Lyebish was with me in the ghetto, he was with me
 in the camp, he was with 
me two years in the woods, and he got killed.
 Kishel disappeared. 
After the war, Kishel 
became very important because he was a lead
er in the AK, in th
e underground, and he 
was not any more inter -- internal revenue, he
 was older, he had got married. He -- he had 
children. He lives now in a to
wn  in Po land. And I wrote his stories. They  are now angry 
why I told his story. I told his 
story because this is the truth.
 So those two were killed. So 
from the six, only four
 survived. Now, from th
e four, from the four, six months later, 
Lyba, who was our savior, who was the tra
pper, was poisoned in our -- in the village, 
there he was -- there he was poisoned, he di
ed . His brother Herschel was older, he went 
to Palestine before it -- Israel, and he died
 in Israel. Lyebish, my brother, came to 
America, and he died  in 1965, as a -- got th
e heart attack, he died. So  I am the only one 
alive from our group, and there were very, ve
ry seldom places that
 Jews organized. So 

happens we organized in the woods, nobody su
rvives that. I have to tell those stories. 
Now, I know every one who got killed. I even
 wanted to write a book that everybody™s 
dead. How it was, how he was killed, how he 
was betrayed -- mostly 
they were betrayed 
by Poles. Maybe I will do it yet. Why? Beca
use I™m the only one w
ho wa -- I™m alive. 
And if I would not be alive, 
nobody would know the stories. 
I tell to the fa
milies. If they 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
21
 
 
 
have somebody [indecipherable] how they  we
re with me in the 
woods, and how they 
died. So  from the 125, I am only one alive. 
Q: Let™s go back then , and talk a little b
it about your personal 
liberation. How did it 
happen, and wh at -- what did you do afterwards? 
A: Well, when my bi -- liberation is, that wh
en it was -- this was after -- after I had to 
escape from the AK, because lik e I said to you, I was a me
mber in the AK, and there 
were a few things, I don™t know if you want
 me to tell you why I left the AK and came 
back to my  brother. So 
the -- this -- this was -- okay, 
so -- so I came back, an -- I was 
about a week or two weeks, bu
t we already saw that it is th
e end. Why? Because we saw 
Ericthsook. We saw that the Germans soldiers
 are coming, and they -- the army, and th-

they occupied the villages with their equi
pment. Every day more
 and more and more 
German soldiers. And we were 
in this time in hiding, becaus
e we didn™t have a group any 
more. So we knew -- and then we started to
 hear cannons. In every -- the night, the 
cannons were louder and lo uder, so we knew th
at this is the end, but how can we survive 
til the end, because in the last min u te -- we su
ffered for six years, in the last min u te we 
will be killed. So my brother, 
with one of those Lybovitch we
nt to a friendly Pole, that 
we used to go once in 
awhile to hide there, and they 
were with them, and I went with 
Lyba to look, to see, to different peasants
. Because we didn™t know exactly, we knew it™s 
coming, but we didn™t know exactly. So I we
nt with Lyba to a p
easant, his name was 
Yanhodor. I had described him, he was very 
good, he was very friendly, he and his 
children. So we went to his house, and th
en we went -- we s -- we heard a unit of 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
22
 
 
 
Calvary, German Calvary is going t -- he was -- 
the road was right next to his house, near 
the woods. And the Calvary is going, you coul
d hear the chains, and the horses. So we 
run in -- in the -- in the barn, 
or wh ere they was -- the hay, and we buried ourselves under 
the hay, and then we -- so we heard that th
e soldiers coming in, ope
ned the door, and they  
taking out hay fo r their -- for the horses. So we
 were afraid that they would take away 
everything, we will be discovered. But we were not discover
ed, and after the -- the calva 
-- the units went, so we came out. We s -- we di
 -- we wanted to ask how the war is going 
on, but he wasn™t home, because
 when he saw that it is alre
ady so bad. So he, with his 
family, he took the few cows, a
nd they were run in to
 the forests to hide
. So they were not 
home. So, when we went out -- so we said, ﬁWe
ll, we have to go to see what our brothers 
are doing,ﬂ because my brother was with his 
brother, but the woman, her name was Mary 
pren -- Prenetta. So we went -- we went to go
 out to see. As we came out from the woods 
where we were, and there was a big clearing, 
and we had to go over to the other side, 
where my  brother, with his brother were. As we
 came out on the clearing, people started 
to shoot at us from both sides. Here in this  side for where we liv
ed, were the Germans, 
and the other side of the clearings were al
ready the Russians. And when  they  saw two 
people, they didn™t know who we
 are. And both started to 
shoot millions of
 bullets. And 
this was at night, and I just see bullets like
 -- like slow bugs, red, light [indecipherable]. 
And so, we were afraid, so st -- luckily ther
e was a small -- not a river, it was some water, 
we jump ed in in the water. 
And the -- the -- the -- the shooting stopped, and there were 
haystacks, because this was in 
the time when they cut the hay,
 this was -- so we went in 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
23
 
 
 
in the haystacks to cover our
selves. The shooting stopped, 
and then we didn™t know 
where, what, when. We knew that there is 
a shooting betw een us. So  wh en -- sudden ly 
there were two horses -- two ri
ders on one horse, from a distan
ce, and it was at night. So  
Lyba, my friend, says, ﬁOh, I know those peasan
ts.ﬂ And he even said 
to me their name is 
-- one name is Poslooshnid. And he rememb ers 
even the horse, because
 he sold them the 
horse before the war. Now, ﬁGo,ﬂ he said, ﬁa
sk them. Because if I™m going to ask them, 
they know I am a Jew,
 they could kill me. But you go, 
they don™t know who you are.ﬂ 
And I was dressed like a peasant, no shoes, w
ith a jacket, and -- and I run up to them, and 
they were on a -- two on a horse, and I -- I co
uldn™t see who they  are. And I started to y -- 
to yell, Parnyi Po slooshnid, Po slooshnid. Th
ey  heard me, they stopped. And when I run 
to them, and I come to them, and I saw on th
e horse, there are two SS men on the horse. 
And they -- and naturally they 
were dr-dressed, with the helm
et, but in the distance I saw 
a silhouette. So wh en th ey saw me, I s -- I didn™t know wh at to do
. To run away it was 
too late, ba -- so they jump
ed down from the horse, right 
away took out their guns, and 
they start asking who I am. Now, I didn™t want to say that I speak German, because 

usually Jews spoke German, not peasants. And 
I started to tell them with a crying voice, 
you know, what will I do, my wi
fe is  in the woods, my ch
ildren in the w
oods. They say 
the Russians are raping the women, and I start -- so I could see that one of them 

understands Polish. Probably he
 was from Salazzi or something, and I could hear that 
he™s translating to th e other sold ier what
 I am saying. And when I saw that he™s 
translating, so I started to cry more, and I 
said, ﬁHelp me, help me. We were with the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
24
 
 
 
Germans, nothing happened to 
us, an -- and now the Russians 
will come in a,ﬂ -- well, so 
he said -- the [indecipherable] he listened to me
. So then he said to his -- so the other man 
said to him in German, whic
h I understood, he said, ﬁNow, we don™t have to go.ﬂ 
Because they were a patrol to see wa -- fro
m where the Russian. We don™t have to go -- 
because they were afraid for 
themselves, too. Let™s take him to our headquarters, and he 
will tell us everything what
 we have to know. And they said
 to me, the guy, in Polish, to 
go in front of them into -- they will take me. 
So -- and they went back on the horse, put 
back their revolvers in their holster, th
ey had rifles, they 
were back in the 
[indecipherable] and I had to go 
in front. Now, I knew that if 
I would go there, I would be 
killed. Why? Because I had a jacket, and un
derneath the jacket I had a belt, and on the 
belt I had the revol -- I had the revolver, I ha
d hand grenades, I had 
a hatchet, I had a 
bayonet, I have a flashlight. I have everythi
ng I had on me. Now when  -- they didn™t see 
it, because it was the -- the 
jacket covered it. But I alwa
ys had a revolver, and the 
revolver with the long barrel, 
remember, parabellum, I had. No, it wasn™t a parabellum, it 

was a -- a revolver. [indecipherable], and I always
 had it not in my  holster, but I have it -- 
had it in front of me in my  belt, stuck in my
 belt. And as they went
 back on the horse, I 
figure -- I said, ﬁThis is my chance.ﬂ I tu
rned around, pulled out
 the revolver, and I 
emptied right away, all seven bullets to them
, they fell down dead . And as I started to 
shoot, then you could see millions of bullets
 came from b o th sides.
 They didn™t know 
who is shooting, they saw shooti
ng. So, you could see it. But lu
ckily, they didn™t hit me. I 
w -- I bend down , I had an even  -- I [indeci
pherable] took aw ay their revolvers, and -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
25
 
 
 
and -- and I took the horse, and I kept th
e horse from th e side where the bullets are 
coming in case a bullet will h
it, it will kill the horse, and I 
moved over to the side, not 
from where I came, but I moved over to the 
opposite side. And I went over because I 
figured why should I go here, 
here are the Germans, and there who know, maybe the 
Russians. I went over there, and as I came 
closer to the woods, and I saw a few came out, 
is a -- Russians, said to me to
 lift -- to raise my hand, and th
ey looked at me, and they ask 
me who I am, so I said, ﬁI am a Polish par tisan.ﬂ I spoke Russian. And they took away 
the revolvers, and they said, ﬁWe have to 
take you to our comman -- commander.ﬂ And 

we went to the comma nder, and 
I told him the whole story, 
and he was very -- see, I 
didn™t know if they would believe me, so I sa
id, ﬁI have a friend he
re, I have to go, and 
we have mo re people. I have to tell them wh
at™s going on, that the Russians are here.ﬂ 
And I still didn™t know if they believed me. 
I remember even I asked them -- I ask them 
to give me a star, what they have on th eir hearts
 a star, to  give me a star to show it to my 
friends that I met the Russians, because they
 [indecipherable]. They gave me back my  
revolver, and they -- and I said I will go back
 with them. And when
 I went away from 
this [indecipherable], I was sure
 that they would shoot me. I 
was sure they don™t believe 
me. And in ma -- I remember wh
en I walked, it™s like I w ould 
walk on air, so that I knew 
that I -- any second a bullet will come in. But 
they didn™t shoot me, and I went back to 
my  friend, he was laying th ere in the haysta
ck. Wh en he saw me, he started to kiss me, 
because he heard the shots, and he thought th
at I was shot. He didn™t know that I shot 
them. And -- so we already knew that on th is
 side are the Russians, on this side are 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
26
 
 
 
Germans, so he took me -- he had the old 
friend, a wo man -- a old woman, and he said, 
ﬁLet™s go to her.ﬂ And we went over to her, 
and we went up on th
e attic, nobody saw us. 
And in -- before -- before, in the morning, he
 -- we hear the door opens, and a Russian 
soldier comes in with a -- w
ith a pat. And he comes in, 
and -- and -- when we saw -- I 
saw a Russian soldier, I jumped
 down. He said, ﬁI came here
, there™s a cow I want to 
milk for some -- I want to milk the cow.ﬂ And 
I grabbed him, and I dance with  him. I said 
[indecipherable]. He said, ﬁYes, during the ni
ght, my unit came into this village, and we 
occupy this village, my unit is here.ﬂ And he
 -- -- an-and we have the -- so this was the 
moment that I knew that I am lib erated, the 
Russians are there. Now, I went right away 
with him. I said, ﬁAnd you take me to yo
ur commander.ﬂ And I told him I™m from a 
Jewish group. Him, I was not afraid any more
 to say [indecipherab le] I didn™t say I was a 
Jew. But Lyba, he didn™t go w ith me. He still was afraid, he
 was very, very careful. He 
said, ﬁI will not go w
ith you,ﬂ and he was still on the a
ttic hiding. He was hiding I don™t 
know how long, and I went out,
 then later I called him, and 
then we went to see -- this 
was already the territory liberated, and I went
 to see my  brother. And I came, and I saw 
my brother sitting with his brother, but they 
were not any more on the attic hiding. They 
were sitting in the kitchen with their [indeciphe
rable], and there in the kitchen were also 
about four or five girls, uniforms, Russian
 officers, because they had a field hospital 
there, and with the fee -- and they were doctors 
in the field hospital, a
nd we started to talk 
in between the -- the four or five girls, two 
of them were Jewish. And we told them that 

we were li -- we were in this, and we -- we
 were and this was how we were liberated. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
27
 
 
 
But, I didn™t go back to my town, because I 
knew that if I will go 
back to my town, I 
would be killed, because they
 knew that I killed those tw
o Augustin brothers. That I 
killed them in my self defense, this didn™
t mean anything. So, I didn™t go back to my 
town. The other two went, and 
they were killed, and we we
nt on, my brother and I, we 
went to Jheshuf, to a larger
 town, where Jews who were 
liberated, came from different 
villages, from different towns, and they ca
me with a guard up there. Now, Lyba and 
Herschel, the two, they didn™t 
go with us, because they were
 village Jews. So they still 
remained in the village to be there living with the peasants. 
This was the day, the night I 
was liberated. 
Q: Before we go on to talk
 a little bit more what -- wh
at happened then, what did 
liberation feel like to you? There was 
the mo ment of joy when  you saw -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- the Russian soldier, but it 
was not that simple, was it? 
A: Well, when it was -- when I saw the Russian
 soldiers, it was a moment of joy that I 
was liberated. But a moment later, it was a v e
ry sad mo ment. And the sad mo ment was -- 
I actually started to cry, the sad moment wa
s, I am liberated, but what happened to my  
people? Where are my sisters? W h ere are my 
whole family? So I am liberated , so I will 
be fr -- see, my personal life was not so im
portant. Important was that they were not 
alive, and specially the childre
n. So  my  brother was with me
. Now, I couldn™t -- I -- I -- I 
thought about the people who were killed, 
but I also thought how my brother feels, 
because he lost the sa
me family, but he also lost a wi
fe and three children. So he was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
28
 
 
 
much more in pain, because his wife and th
ree children, which he loved very mu ch. And 
there were a child from 12 years, child from 10 years, and a girl from seven years. So he -
- but he didn™t talk too mu ch about it. The pa
in he kept inside. And this was a very bad -- 
to me, I had to go through it more. Th-the
 pain was when I was libera -- it was n o t a 
glorious time, because I couldn™t believe that I 
am alive, this is the first thing. I -- it -- it 
was like -- like my mind was someplace else. I wa
s glad when I came to Jheshuf, if I -- 
some people survived . It was not a happy time,
 because everybody started to speak what 
we lost. Now we are here, what now? Wh at 
do we do now? We are single people, without 
the family, and naturally we 
moved in. On e of our friends 
was from this to
wn, we took 
over his apartment, an d we all 
moved in with him. We live
d together because nobody had 
a fami ly. And th ere were two Po lish women wh
o help ed them surviv
e. So they became 
the -- the -- the persons who cooked for us, 
and we lived together for a short time. 
Q: What -- what kind of -- were you in half
way decent physical shape, what -- how -- 
A: In physical shape, I was in
 physical shape. The reason 
why I was in physical shape 
was -- the others were not in physical shape.
 I was in physical sh
ape for two reasons. The 
first thing is that I just came back from th
e AK. In the AK we had everything. When I 
was in the woods with my gun, as a Jew, 
I had to -- I only could go out when  it was a 
heavy rain, and blizzard, snow. I never walk
ed out when the moon was 
shining. The 
moon was our biggest enemy. So -- but then  
later, when I came to the AK, I was a hero. 
When we came to the villages, 
the girls kissed us, the girls br
ought us the most best food, 

and the people. We were heroes
, we were the -- we were the 
same  people. We wanted to  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
29
 
 
 
fight the Germans the same way.
 So there I had a lot of food, and not -- and -- and -- and 
I was not in bad physical -- I had to dress -- I 
had in this time, a -- a 
jacket, pants. I -- I -- 
I -- it was n o t so bad. Well, before I left
 for the AK, we were
 infested with lice 
[indecipherable]. But then I could go out, 
and I could wash. My 
brother was by this 
[indecipherable], but he was a very strong ma
n. He was exceptional.
 By us, in our town, 
before the war, if somebody 
wanted to give an example of strength, they always 
mentioned him. He was very strong boy. No
t that he was a fighter, but he was known 
[indecipherable]. So his physical was not ba
d. Wh at others who surv ived , they came out, 
they™re like skeletons. They  were laying underg
round for -- for a year, two years, like in a 
-- like in a -- in a grave. And th-they had a 
little food what somebody 
gave them, if they 
didn™t kill them. So mostly people came, and some couldn™teven walk. They walked -- 
when  they  walked, th ey walked
 like -- like on all four. They
 were -- because they were 
not used to work , because they were laying 
in a grave for two years. And wh en th ey 
suddenly  had to go up, and to stand 
up on their feet, they couldn™t.  
Q: When  you say in  the grave, do 
you mean from concentration camps? 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no. I™m
 not talking now concentra
tion camps, I™m talking now by 
people who survived in hiding
. I™m not talking concen tration camps. So wh ere they were 
in hiding, la -- the people came out, from 
the first few days, where -- who were the 
people? They were the people who were -- ha
d some friendly -- or for money, who were 
hidden. So they came out
. So we gathered in 
this town. Then, we didn™t have yet people 
from concen tration, because the concen trations 
were not liberated yet. We didn™t have the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
30
 
 
 
people who were -- survived in
 -- in Siberia. They didn™t come yet. We had some people 
who survived like my wife, on illegal papers
, and now the Russians 
came out, so they 
came, they saw Jews that th
ey came. They still were on ille
gal papers. They didn™t want 
to come out, because they di
dn™t know what will go on. Bu
t they came to i-indentify 
themselves, but most the people the first fe
w days, mo st the people were people who 
came out from hiding.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a conintua -- this is a continuation of a Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum interview with Norman Salsitz. This is
 tape number two, side A. So, how -- how 
long, approximately, did you remain in that 
town or village, and wh
at happened -- what 
happened then? 
A: Well, this was not a village, it was a town
. As a matter of fact, now it™s a very big 
town, and it™s the head of -- the capital of
 a state, Jheshuf. Now, I was there -- 
Q: Just one second, I have to rearrange the 
microphone ju st a little bit, so -- just one 
second. Okay, yes, that™s good. 

A: We lived there a few weeks. We didn™t ha
ve money after we came out, so my  brother 
started to do business, he started to make
 some money. And -- but ma -- with me, I 
always wanted to fight, to be involved in 
the war, so I -- I went, and I volunteered. I 
volunteered t -- it was very unusual for a Jewi
sh survivor to voluntee
r, because Poland in 
this time, nem -- organized -- the army  was organized Ru ssia, but Po land 
[indecipherable]. They to
ok in   my years -- where they 
-- they were born in 1920, to the 
army , but they didn™t take Je ws. Not because they didn™t wa
nt to take Jews, but they 
didn™t have no ev iden ce about the Jews, they
 didn™t know who survived, and very few 
survived. So actually, th
ey didn™t mobilize, they didn™t
 draft the Jewish boys. But I 
wanted, definitely to be part of it. So -- an
d also, it happened once, it a -- it was a -- a -- a 
episode that I went in to a barber. I have this
 story in the book. I went into a barber, and I 
-- I suspected everybody was a k
iller. Like naturally, if I woul
d be the ge -- in Germany, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
32
 
 
 
when I was in Germany, I lo
oked on ev erybody, and ev ery
body I thought, ﬁWas he the 
killer of my mother, of my sist
ers?ﬂ But in Poland, 
even, they were so 
against our groups, 
that they -- I suspected that the majority, they
 didn™t like Jews. So 
wh en I went over once, 
to a barber, and there were -- there were pe
ople -- there were people sitting there and 
waiting in line for the barber, and I looked at
 them, and I looked at
 the faces, I didn™t 
know them. So I looked at the faces, and I 
thought they all looke
d at me that they 
recognize I am a Jew. Maybe 
they  recognize, maybe I was not dressed the same  way as 
they. And -- and this was after I came out 
from -- from the woods. And -- and I -- I s -- I 
start to think maybe I made a bad mistakes, th
at I came over here to
 this barber, and who 
knows what they will do to me
? And little by little, the fear built 
up, in -- in -- in me, and 
when I t -- came my m-mind that 
I should go to the ch
air to be shaved and cut the hair. So 
-- but I went over there, and then later -- he cut my hair, and then later we star -- he 
wanted to shave, and he put in some cream, or some soap on my 
face, and when -- when 
he took the -- the -- to -- to 
cut -- to shave me, the blade -- th
e razor blade -- I thought that 
I see that all the people who are sitting around 
the chairs, that all ar
e winking to him, and 
they said, ﬁNow, now.ﬂ It was 
so the fear, this was when I 
came out, and -- and I was sure 
that this what they are doing, 
which later I fin d  out they didn
™t. But I though
t so. An as -- 
as he -- he was finish with the -- with the cr
eam on my  face, and he 
took the razor blade, 
and he wanted to shave me, he started to sh
ave my  neck, I grabbed his hand, and -- and I 
stood up, and I run out. Even my face was -- 
was filled with -- was -- now I run out, and -
- and -- and -- and when I -- when I came out, 
and I ran a -- where we 
lived, and I said to 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
33
 
 
 
my brother, who was -- like I sa
id, I am going to the army, I 
want to be one mo re day, 
because this gave me so much
 fear. Now later, I was -- when 
I was in this town, later I 
was ashamed to go to pass his store, because
 I was ashamed what I did, because I knew 
that this was not -- but they were sitting th
ere, they couldn™t u
nderstand why 
I had run 
away in the middle. But to da -- we will -- I 
lived with so much fear, because everybody 
was killed. 
Q: Did your brother want to 
join you with the army, too? 
A: No, no, my  brother never 
thought -- and don™t forg et, he
 was 16 years older, and he 
was not a man like to join, he was not like a 
-- a -- advent -- to like adventuristic, what I 
am -- he -- he had a wife, with three children, 
they were killed. He was not -- so he was -- 
he started to do business. And then  I went
 -- I went and I volunteered, and because I 
volunteered, I had a choice to pick out the -- 
the part, which unit I want to be, and I 
wanted to be a pilot, because
 I thought being a pilot, I w
ould be able to
 bomb German 
town s, and to take mo re revenge. So beca
use I was a volunteer, they gave me some 

certain test, in front the whole group, a few of
 them were accepted to
 them -- to -- to the 
air force school, which was in 
this time in Quibishevo, in Si
beria, they didn™t have in 
Poland, they  had this air force military school. 
So wh en -- when th ey picked me out, I m -

- asked the doctor -- there was a young, Russian
 doctor, and I asked him how come that I 
was -- I pass all the tests, when they were 
such strong Polish boys
 who never had hunger, 
and this and that, and they were
 not accepted, and I was accepted. He said, ﬁWell, this is 
the reason, because you went through so 
much, and nothing bothe
rs you.ﬂ And I was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
34
 
 
 
accepted, and I was sent over a few days late
r, where I got orders to go -- to go to q -- 
Quibishevo, which first we ha
d to go to  Lublin , wh ere in 
this time w as the temp orary -- 
the temporary capital of Poland, and there we 
gathered togeth er the whole group, I think 
it was about 400 from the whole to -- country. 
And then we waited for 
a transport to go to 
Quib ishevo, to go to  join this officer™s school
, which, th ere is a -- [clock ch iming]. But 
that is a other story why I didn™t go, and I™m 
writing this story that I didn™t go, but I was 
in the army, and I was transferred to a differe
nt, special unit, and -- because they  wanted 
that -- I told them from where I am, so th
ey wanted I should 
be in the -- in the 
intelligence, in this section, because I knew the territory, I knew the people. And I was 
sent back to Jheshuf, he ripped up the pape
r, this man who was in -- who was a colonel. 
He said, ﬁDon™t worry, don™t go,ﬂ I was afraid  
that I will go to jail, that I don™t go where I 
was sent. So he said to me not to  be afraid, and [clock chiming]. 

Q: The clock is really getting us here. 
A: It™s alrig h t. So -- so -- and then I was sent
 back to this town, a
nd th is is how I became 
a member of this intelligent group. 

Q: T-T-Two questions. You were
 there with a Polish identity? 
A: Well, when I -- no, when I 
joined the army -- when I went
, and I volunteered, I alre -- 
I took back my own identity, 
and I took my own identity as
 Naftali Salishitz, where I 
figured the war is ended, that™s it. But, 
when -- when I changed -- I waited for this 
transport to this air force group, and th ere is
 -- it™s a long story, if you in ter -- I™m j -- I 
just wrote an article about it. And a girl sa
w me there, she recognized I™m -- I™m a Jew, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
35
 
 
 
whate -- and she took me to her boss, who was 
a colonel, and he wa
s the head personnel 
officer, from -- from the army . And sh e introduc
ed  me to him, and he said, ﬁWell, don™t 
go th ere.ﬂ And he said, ﬁWhy you going to th e 
air force school?ﬂ So  I said, ﬁWell, I want 
to learn to be a pilot, to be able to -- to 
bomb Germany.ﬂ He said, ﬁL
ook, this is already 
August in -- in ™44, how lo
ng do you think we™re 
-- the war will last? Maybe it™ll last a 
other two or three months, maybe a half a 
year. As -- the school, i-it would take two 
years. After two years, there wouldn™t no -- 
be no war. So  who would you bomb ? So  you 
will -- you will waste two years.ﬂ He said, ﬁI w
ill give you a better job. You want to take 
revenge? I will put you in a unit 
is -- that it is that Polish 
inf,ﬂ -- it was called information 
unit, it was like then the military CIC, and in
telligence, and he said, ﬁIf you want to take 
revenge on the Germans, then 
you will be -- you will have a possi
bility.ﬂ So I said to him, 
ﬁBut I already have a order to go to -- to 
Qu ibishevo.ﬂ He said, ﬁWhere is the order?ﬂ I 
showed it him, and he took and ripped it up
. I said, ﬁWhat are you doing, I will go to 
jail.ﬂ He said, ﬁDon™t worry, don™t worry, I 
know what I am doing.ﬂ He was then chief 
personnel. So he called th
e sixth secretary, and sh e said, ﬁMake him out a new 
document.ﬂ And he said -- what -- ﬁBut he can
not be on his name in this unit. So  wh at 
name should it,ﬂ -- so I told him my  name was Tadosh Yadduch in the Polish 

underground. He said, ﬁNo, if you were 
in the Polish undergroun
d, which they are 
enemies of our government, [indecipherable], 
you cannot have the same name. Tadosh is 
okay, it™s a first name , but let™s see about the 
second name.ﬂ So we started to think about 
th e seco nd  n ame, my  n ame i s 
Salishitz, so I wanted to have
 Salishitz spelled like in 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
36
 
 
 
Polish, so then I said, ﬁWhat™s about Szaleski  [indecipherable]?ﬂ She said, ﬁThis is a fine 
name. You will be Tadosh Szaleski right away
 on the spot.ﬂ They made me o u t a new 
military book, a new document, a
nd he called the secretary, he said to the -- to her to 
write a letter to the head of 
the Polish [indecipherable] of 
the Polish army in Jheshuf, and 
he wrote a letter which it was not true, he wrot
e, ﬁI know this man for a long time, he™s a 
very reliable man, and I want 
you should give him the best 
opportunity. Put him in a na -- 
in -- in a leader™s -- in a lead
ership position, in a [indeciphera
ble].ﬂ And -- and this is how 
-- I took this paper, and I went back, and th is 
how I remained in Jheshuf, being in this -- 

in this unit. And -- 
Q: Do you reme mb er hi
s name, by any chance?  
A: Whose name? 
Q: The -- th-the commander? 
A: Sure. His name was Gorosh. Gorosh . I know
 th e first name also, but his name was a -- 
he was -- he was the head of personnel from the [indecipherable]. 
Q: And what did you do? 

A: Then -- 
Q: In your position? 
A: In my pos -- in my position, I was -- when 
I came back to Jheshu
f, I -- I was s -- they 
prepared -- they prepared a un
it -- see, this was -- this was 
already about, I would say in 
end of October, beginn
ing of November. So they prep
ared because -- for the last 
offensive, if you know -- the 
last offensive, because th
e front was stopped about 20 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
37
 
 
 
kilometer past Jheshuf, and 
there was the front staying th ere for six months. They 
prepared the new offensive, 
which started Jan u ary the 12
th
, 1945, and this was the last 
putsch so  -- for Berlin. And we -- I was included
 in the -- in the group -- in the group, to 
take over towns when we -- when the offens
ive will go, we will lib
erate towns from our 
group, they -- our people will take over 
the towns, because it was not a civil 
administration. So the army would take it ove
r, an then later the civil administration will 
bega -- and I was assigned to take over -- one 
to take -- to go to Kraków, was -- Kraków 
was the second largest town, an
d the most historical town in
 Poland, and also the -- that 
docto r -- th-the head of the govern ment in 
-- in Poland was -- was in Kraków, so I was 
assigned to remain the Kraków, and -- and to be
 part of the Polish intelligence in Kraków. 
And then  the w -- in the book I descri
be how I met my wife, and so th -- 

Q: Let™s -- let™s do that -- let™s do that over 
-- did you have a speci
al mission when you 
went to Kraków? 

A: Yes, well, the special mi ssion is we shoul
d take over th-the -- the running, because 
there was not administration -- civil administration. So  the army  would take it over. So I -

- my -- the special mission was,
 when we came closer th 
-- because we went with the 
Russian front, and we were attach
ed, hundred of us were attach
ed to the first lin es of the 
Russian front, because the front starte
d offensive like I said, January the 12
th
, and we 
were attached, and we were like -- like -- not lik
e zion officers, but we were part of the -- 
the -- the front f-fighters, but we didn™t do the 
fighting, but we went 
with them, they had 
to be straightened out with 
the local people, with the admi
nistration, yeah. So we went 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
38
 
 
 
with them, and I am describing this in details 
in the book, and then 
when we came before 
Kraków, and Kraków was a very, very important
 town, because the fi
rst thing it was the 
mo st historical Polish town , because the capi
tal, it was the capital, and it was the -- the 
place of the kings. They lived 
in Kraków, and also it was the barbel. Barbel is the castle 
where all the kings lived, and they™re buried. So
 we find out about three days before -- we 
were before Kraków, s -- and this was the fr
ont was going, we went with the front, and 
they -- did the Russian army 
went forwards, and the German went back. So, about three 
days before we came before Kraków, and al
so Kraków was not ok -- was not taken -- like 
usually in a war, you go from the -- and this 
time we went from the 
east to the west, like 
the army didn™t go from east to th
e west. What they did, they wanted  to surround, and to  
destroy the rush -- the German garmi zone in
 Kraków. So what th
e Russian, was a very 
smart thing what they did, they went -- befo
re Kraków they went to the north , and then  
they surrounded, and they came
 into Kraków from the west. 
Because, actually, they had 
to enter Kraków from the east
, but they came in thr -- from 
the west, and we went with 
them, and we went part of it, and in about th
ree days before we were before Kraków, we 
find out that Kraków is mined, that they pu
t in mines in Kraków, 
with columns, with 
explosives, and the -- and in  any minute, th
e mi -- and -- and -- and their aim is to 
explode the town , and to  destroy the whole to
wn. We knew about it, because we had the 
fifth c-columns that they are doi
ng it. Now -- so they wanted to
 -- yes, and as we came to 
the -- closer to Kraków from th
e west, so the Russian engineer
s, if -- f-find out that they 
already found so me installations with [ind
ecipherable], where there were important 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
39
 
 
 
build ings, but they couldn™t destroy the whole 
thing, because it™s lik
e -- like this was the 
end. So  they  could dismantle all -- detach th
e electricity from the end of houses, but this 
was like -- like a snake. If you cu t off a piece of
 tail of a snake, th
e whole snake is still 
alive. We had to know that central installation from where the whole town, the electricity 
is connected. So they 
picked out -- they pick
ed out three officers to
 go to  Kraków and to  
find out. And th is was before Krak ów was even
 liberated, and th-the 
Russians picked out. 
Now I -- th -- I had very good recommendations
, because like I told you that this man 
wrote to the leaders that he knows me, said I 
am special in this, I did so mu ch during th e 
underground, you know. And then  we pi
cked out one -- a native Krakówian, who 
survived the war in -- in th 
-- in the Russia, and later he 
joined the Polish army, and he 
came back with the Polish army, and so  
he -- wi -- and because he was a native 
Krakówian, and so he was very
 important, and th en we -- they
 invi -- they picked out the 
other men with us, so three of us, we got th
e order to go in to se
e how we can find out 
where the people who -- who built those thi
ngs are, maybe we can prevent from the 

destruction. And we came into Kraków, this 
was winter, it was very cold. Remember, we 
came into Kraków January the 17
th
. The Russians took over part, 
but the ar -- a big part 
was still in the German hands,
 because officially, the town  was liberated January the 19
th
, 
and we were there already the 17
th
, through channels, and je -- 
and also we had people in 
Kraków who were a fifth column for us. So 
we contacted some, and we find out that it™s 
true, that the Germans want to destroy, and 
they built, in Kraków, 
they built columns on 
the main thoroughfares -- the main streets, they built columns s -- f 
-- a story high, with 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
40
 
 
 
four feet in diameter, filled with dynamite
. Everything was connected, and everything 
had to be blown up with  one push of a butt
on. And -- and they had also mines, the main 
post office, and the railroad station, the [inde
cipherable] was -- was the king™s castle. All 
the mo st important build ing, everything wa s mined. Were 287 mines all together in 
Kraków, and this had to  be de
stroyed with one push of a but
ton, and we knew that the -- 
if we will come closer th -- the -- this will 
happen. So, we were wor -- we worried very 

mu ch. And we started to have 
leads where finally we find out -- and again, in the book I 

write a little mo re about it, you cannot have 
the whole book here. We
 find out that the -- 

that the company who made t
hose column s, and those mines 
was done by an Austrian 
comp any, Meyerader and Krauss.
 And the Meyerader and Krauss isn™t -- the headquarters 
was on th e street Yuloushalaya
, and we find out, and this wa
s a winter night, a blizzard, 
cold, and we went -- we sent over the three to
 find out if -- if they -- they -- we can find 
out something. They  came back 
they couldn™t -- they didn™t 
let in nobody, because every 
place where there was a German company, they
 -- and this was in the most exclusive 
place in Kraków, where the Germ
an took over, and then the ne
xt [indecipherable] was the 
Gestapo, and -- and so he ba -- by -- those 
places there was a iron gate, and around th e 
iron gate there was a concrete 
bunker, with openings, with ma
chine guns, they always did 
it there, and we sent over those, and th -the
y couldn™t go in, the three guys, so we three 
went, said, well we will go ourselves. And before
 we went there, as I cross the street I 
find out that there is a -- a-apartments, that
 there was the Zunderdi
enst. Zunderdienst was 
auxiliary to the SS, which was from ethnic Ge rmans. And we came in, the Zunderdienst 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052

left, and there were about eight girls, and 
the girls were cooks, and not cooks, and 
partners to sleep and all those things, well -- 
so we came in, and we -- we had vodka, we 
cigarettes, and a -- w -- and we became very fri
endly with them, and they told  us about 
this building across the street 
from the Meyerade and Krauss. 
A n d  th ey  to ld  
us that the 
Germans left already, about two days ago, bu
t they left over the secretary, and she™s still 
there. So a -- I couldn™t understand how comes 
they left and they le
ft the secretary, a 
German girl. She said, ﬁYeah, she™s there, b
ecause they saw her after the Germans left.ﬂ 
And I asked them how do you 
know that she was German? 
Oh sh e, they know because 
she used to come after 
the curfew, and she used to be -- th
ey brought her with the cars. So 
we did -- the two -- the three who we sent didn™t
 -- couldn™t go in, so we went there, and 
we knocked on the door, and no
body let us in, and so we were ready -- this was already 
start to be dark, so we -- I wanted to -- to op
en th -- the door, to sh
ut the door, then I saw 
that somebody™s looking th rough the window, a 
young girl. So I said, ﬁLet™s wait.ﬂ And 

the janitor came, he said
, ﬁNobody™s here, they all left.ﬂ So
 I told him, ﬁWell, I saw there 
a young girl in the window.ﬂ So he saw that
 we know, so he said, ﬁWait, I™ll b ring the 

keys.ﬂ He went up, he got the 
keys, and we came in. So in 
the apartment we came, it was 
the most beautiful apartment 
with oil paintings, carpets, b eautiful. And there were -- and 
there were four wo men, one was the daughte
r-in-law of the owner of the house, then 
were two peasant girls, they were the maids, 
and then I s -- I saw a beautiful girl, dressed 
very nice, she wa -- she was standing there. So  
I start to ask who they 
are, then they told 
us [indecipherable] and when I came to he
r, she said, ﬁWell, my name is Felicia

Muirashefska.ﬂ And I ask her whose apartment it 
is, she said, ﬁWell, th
is is the apartment 
that we live, but it belong to  Meyerader 
and Krauss,ﬂ and I start to ask her mo re 
questions, she got annoyed, I got annoyed, an
d -- and she -- I said, ﬁHow could you have 
a job l -- wh-what -- do you work here?ﬂ She sa
id, ﬁI work, but than
k God I don™t work 
any more, because the German
s left already.ﬂ I said, ﬁW
ell, what do you mean the 
Germans left already? You are German, aren
™t you?ﬂ She said, ﬁNo, I am Polish,ﬂ and 
she showed me a kanekarta. So I said, ﬁYeah,
 we find out different, we find out that you 
were German.ﬂ But we questioned and questi
ons, and -- and I got very nasty, she got -- 
she didn™t cooperate. She look
ed  at this guy, th e guy who wa
s a Krakówian, he had a very  
Semitic face, he looked like he was a Polish o fficer, but he looked like -- he didn™t have a 
Slavic face. So she asks if -- 
if she can speak to him. So 
I said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ And then -- and 
then -- and she went with him to the other 
room, and she said to him, ﬁWhat are you 
bothering me, I am th e same as y ou.ﬂ He sa
id, ﬁWhat do you mean
, I am the same as 
you? I am a Polish officer, and you are a Germ
an.ﬂ She said, ﬁNo, I™m not a German, I™m 
Polish, and -- and besides, I™m 
the same as you. You are a Jew, and I am a Jew.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁHow do you know that I am a Jew?ﬂ ﬁWell,
 look on your face, it™s -- you can -- I can see 
you are Jewish.ﬂ And then he ask from where 
are you, from where are you, so he said, ﬁI 
am from Kraków.ﬂ She says, 
ﬁFrom Kraków where are you?ﬂ My  wife said, and -- and 
she™s from Shtanuslabu. She sa
id, ﬁYou know, I was in th
e Jewish -- in the Hebrew 
gymnasium, and there was a Jewish boy
 from Kraków, whose name was Oscar 
Margoulis, he went with me to the Hebr
ew gymn asium.ﬂ And wh en he heard Oscar 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
43
 
 
 
Margoulis, he -- he almost fainted. So i -- Os
car Margoulis is my first cousin. So he -- 
and he asked her wh at happened  to  him, so 
he had the best proof that she™s telling the 
truth, and he came in, and he said to me -- he
 calls me in  the corn
er, and he said, ﬁYou 
know, this -- this pretty girl,ﬂ and she was 
very pretty, ﬁthis pretty girl, she is not a 
German. She™s not even Polish, she™s Jewish.ﬂ
 I said, ﬁYou are crazy. How can she be 
Jewish here?ﬂ So he -- and he was a womanizer, 
every girl he wanted to have. So I said, 
ﬁYou know,ﬂ -- and Januk was his name, ﬁyou know, Januk, you are so -- if you had 
found Eva Braun,ﬂ -- you know who Eva Bra
un was, yeah? ﬁYou would make from her a 

Jews just to have to go to sl
eep with her.ﬂ So she said no 
-- he said, ﬁNo, you go and f -- 
prove yourself -- you cannot -- she proved it to
 me, she wen,ﬂ -- so I said, ﬁYeah, she 
proved it, you are even -- told 
them that she showed
 you that she™s circumcised.ﬂ So -- so 
then later I started to interrogate her. And in
 the beginning she didn™t want to cooperate, 
then later -- I didn™t want to ask her if she 
is Jewish, because the people -- there was the 
janitor, were there three other, and this wa
s very dangerous, because Kraków was not 
completely liberated. The Ge
rmans sometime s made a [indecipherab le] and they found 
the Jews came out, and they
 killed them. So -- so I as
k her, ﬁDo you speak other 
languages?ﬂ She said, ﬁYes, I speak German, I 
speak,ﬂ -- of course she spoke in Polish -- 
ﬁI speak Russian, and I speak Hebrew, and I 
speak English.ﬂ So I 
said, ﬁEnglish?ﬂ And I 
spoke a little English. See I -- I learned Eng
lish. The only time I fi
n d  out I don™t speak 
English is when I came to th
e United States. So -- so I 
-- I remember I ask her from 
which nation are you, and sh e said, ﬁJewish.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁHow can you pr
ove it?ﬂ She said, ﬁI 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
44
 
 
 
can speak Hebrew.ﬂ So 
I said, ﬁSpeak to me Hebrew.ﬂ 
She said, ﬁWa -- how can I speak -
- I speak to you Hebrew ? You don™t understa
nd what I am saying, because look in your 
face, y-you -- you -- you don™t -- you look like 
a Polish anti-Semite.ﬂ And sh e started to 
tell me that I shouldn™t bother her. Well, [i ndecipherable] when she spoke Hebrew, I 
thought oh, she is Jewi sh, or
 maybe the Germans -- she™s not, maybe the Germans taught 
her to speak Hebrew, and she 
would go out and s-spy on Jews
, and -- so I asked her this 
time, I asked her, ﬁTell me, when do Jews pray  K
oniterra?ﬂ Koniterra, th
is is a prayer that 
we pray in  Yom Kippur. And with out thinki
ng, she answered Yom 
Kippur. Then when -- 
when  she said Yom Kippur, she started -- sh e stopped, and sh e said, ﬁWait a second, wait 
a second. Ho w do you know ab
out Yom Kippur?ﬂ She said, ﬁYou wa -- don™t tell me,ﬂ 
she said, ﬁyou -- you -- you -- you -- you, too,
 you too?ﬂ So  -- and she started -- and sh e 

had tears in her eyes. So I said, ﬁYes, I too, 
I too.ﬂ And then later, so I knew that she is 
Jewish, and she knew that I am Je
wish, then I told her what I 
need, said I need the plans. 
She said, ﬁWhy didn™t you tell me right away
, I would gi -- I have the plans.ﬂ And she 
went with  me to the other room, and she ope
ned the safe, she had the safe, and she gave 
me the plans. Now also, before we went in 
there, now -- so we, between us, we spoke -- 
we said, ﬁWell, if we will get the plans,ﬂ -- we
 didn™t know if it™s a woman, if it™s a man , 
now somebody has to k
ill the person, because if we got 
some information like this, the 
person had to be liquida
ted, because in case l et™s say sh
e would give me the plans, she 
could notify her superiors that we already ha
ve the plans, and she would spoil the whole 
thing. So -- and then when we
 f -- when we find out there is 
a woman, so they s -- it came 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
45
 
 
 
-- it fell on me, why? Because a da
y before we did a job, someth
ing similar like this, this 
so -- they did it, so they said
, ﬁNow, it™s your part.ﬂ It means that I had to do it. And -- 
but when  she gave me the plans, so we ha
d the -- if she wouldn™t give us -- if she 
wouldn™t -- I wouldn™t find out she is Jewi
sh, I definitely would sh oot her. Not -- she 
shouldn™t call up her -- and -- to the -- so -- so  
then later she gave me the plans, and the 
plans were exactly how then -- 
the column s, everything. So 
I brought it over to the -- to 
the Russian intelligence, which we
 -- we worked together, and th
ey had the plans, so they 
send out engineers and they -- and they did 
everything that it shouldn™t be -- yeah, 
because when she gave me the pl
ans, so she said to me -- sh
e said to me -- so I said, ﬁI 
have to ru n,ﬂ took th e plan, because any minut
e the columns will blow
 up. She said, ﬁNo, 
don™t wo rry, they wouldn™t blow up, because,
ﬂ -- I asked her why. ﬁCause,ﬂ she said, 
ﬁtwo days before, I got a phone call for the 
camp™s commandant from Kraków, from that 
commander in Kraków, and he ask if this is
 the comp any Meyerader and Krauss, I said 
yes, and -- and so he said -- 
he didn™t ask questions
, he only said, Sp ringen zie dez oilen.ﬂ 
So detonate the columns, becau se before her boss left, he 
told her that she will get a 
phone call, that in -- 
they would tell her that the column s have to be destroyed. Se -- I 
mean, dek -- will be detonated. So she got th
is phone call, springen zie dez oilen. Now, 
he didn™t ask who sh e is, but she didn™t -- she -- 
he didn™t ask, s-she was not afraid in case 
she wouldn™t do it, which they will come to
 her. So meanwhile when she got this 
telephone -- so she notified the Akar, the Po
lish underground, because she wa -- was a 
memb er of the Polish underg round, and she told
 them that -- what the telephone was, and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
46
 
 
 
she was -- she was sure that they will come, an d 
they will do so methi
ng, but they didn™t 
do anything. And th en when  -- and then -- okay. 
Q: -- interrupt here, because -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview 
with Norman Salsitz. This is tape number 
two, side B. So the AK told your -- 
A: The AK didn™t do anything, they didn™t
 tell us, and then later when we did it, 
[indecipherable], she thought it'
s done by the AK, but they di
dn™t do anything. So -- so it 
was -- it was that the columns were taking aw ay the electricity, but the columns were 
staying there for about four 
weeks til they destroyed it. A
nd this is how Kraków was 
saved. Actually, she was the one who saved 
Kraków. And then after, when I came to 
America, th ere were films, reports, and ther
e were about 20 different
 versions how th is 
happened, because everybody kn
ew that it was prepared for detonation, and there was 
different versions. There was even a book ca
me out r -- r -- out in Russian, it™s called, 
ﬁMiore Vihar.ﬂ There™s a Miore Vihar, a Ma jor Vihar -- Vihar, it was [indecipherable], 
that he did it, and that was ma
de a film, the film was so impor
tant that it was serialized on 
television. All right, a Miore Vihar was there, but
 he describes that he was the hero as if 
he got the -- then was a other film, and they
 -- they portrayed the 
pope wh en he was a 
young fellow, and th at the pope was the one 
who find out about it, and he came, he cut 
the wires. I saw the film, the pope wasn™t th
ere. He was in Kraków, but he didn™t have 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
47
 
 
 
anything to do. And there were other -- ot
her versions how it is
, because nobody knew 
about it, she didn™t -- they di
dn™t know til our book came out
. When our book, ﬁAgainst 
Allﬂ sa -- ﬁAll Oddsﬂ came out, so we wrowt -- 
write about it, so they then -- Univ ersity 
Agaloinski, Agaloinion in Krak ów find out abou
t this, so they invite
d us we should co me 
to Kraków, that I should come
 with my wife, but we didn™t go. I didn™t want to go to 
Poland. I wrote them a letter, and -- and this 
-- and this was the end of this episode, that 
she actually saved -- saved the town, the most
 historical town  from Kraków. I don™t know 
if she saved it hundred percent, 
or she had a part in it, that 
it was not if she -- if she would 
say to the camp™s commandant that nobody™s th
ere to detonate, they will send over some 
people. And you also mu st know one thing. 
Now, you would ask a 
question, why did the 
German high co mmand call up, and th at™s it, and they  let it go. You see, when a ger -- 
when the army goes forwards, like the German  army went forwards, there was never a 
better army  in the wo rld. Everything was so 
accurate, poom. And this was also the -- the 
problem with the Holocaust, be
cause they were so accurate 
sa -- during the Holocaust, 
they made everything so perfect, that everyt
hing was in order. The 
same thingwith the 
German army. When they
 went forwards towards Russia, 
everything was so perfect, it 
was the best army. But, when 
the German army retreated, 
it -- it was no different than -- 
it was same as the Egyptian army retreated in
 the Negev, you rememb er in the Six Day 
War? When the Egyptian army retreatedwithout shoes, with
out pants, without 
underwear. Yeah, this is how the German 
army was, because when the army goes 
forwards, and sp ecially when it™s well or
ganized like the Germans, everything -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
48
 
 
 
everything is in order. But wh en  the army  re
treats, nothing is in order, no command, no -- 
nobody knows wh at the other is doing. And fo
r the same thing, when they left Kraków, 
everything was disorganized, there was no co
mmand, so for this reason, they  didn™t 
follow up with the dest
ruction of Kraków.  
Q: So what happen
ed then? You stayed -- you st
ayed in Poland
 for awhile? 
A: Well, I stayed in Poland, and I became -- I became a -- a comman d ant of -- o-o-over -- 

for a certain units for the county of -- of 
Poland -- of Kraków. We
ll, the -- the county, 
which was the town , and th e county. And I st
ayed there from -- th
is where -- I came in 
actually January  the 17
th
, and I was -- there were so 
ma ny th ings happened during the 
time in the beginning to  organize, and th
e -- th e commu nity™s organized a civil 
administration and ev erything. And then -- so
 now in the new book I™m writing episodes 
about it, and I was there til -- til -- I wo
uld say til August ™45. August ™45, I was 
transferred to Breslau, which became Brauslav. 

Q: Give us -- give us just a brief idea, maybe
 just one or two episodes to see w h at it was 
like in Kraków at that time, and what
 -- what your duties -- what you did. 
A: Well, in Kraków in that time, it was ch
aos. Everything was falling apart, and -- and we 
had to put togeth er that Krak
ów it should -- it should functi
on. Now, we were the first 
Polish unit who came into Kra
ków, cause it was occupied 
by the Russians. And the 
Polish unit was not a big unit,
 and then later more came
 in, and we took over the 
administration, til about two, three months la
ter, where there was a civil administration. 
And -- and -- and first we had to  clean out 
Kraków from all collaborators, because there 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
49
 
 
 
were a lot of Polish collaborators who wo
rked with the Germ
ans, who worked -- 
especially the Polish police, 
the Polish police who were in-i
ncorporated into the German 
police. We used to call it in Polish granna to
ppa policia. It means th e navy blue granna -- 
the navy blue police, because 
they had navy blue uniforms,
 but this was the police from 
before the war, and they didn™t behave so 
hundred  percen t like the Polish people desired. 
Well, there were some who be
longed to the underground illega
lly, but the majority, they 
worked with the Germ
an -- they were colla
borators. So now we 
had to clean out the 
Polish police which were colla
borators. There were a lo
t of volksdeutshen. The 
volksdeutshen lived  there, and the volksdeut
shen had fu ll rights under the Germans. And 
when the volksd eutshen,
 when they were di -- discovered,  naturally some of them were 
arrested, so me -- some were collaborators open
ly, and their apartments were confiscated. 
And this was -- this w as mostly -- this wa
s mostly the work fo
r us. Also, the Polish 
government had a big problem, because as 
you know, in Warsaw, in
 Au gust 1944, was 
the uprise in Warsaw. And the uprise -- the Po
lish people wanted to have the uprise in 
Warsaw, and to declare a free Poland wi -- 
go -- government. But the Russians did -- it 
was a trick what they did, as their [indeci
pherable] went forwards
, they were quite -- 
quite successful, and when  they  cam
e to the Vistula, to the east r -- side of the Vistula, 
which is the river, this -- the Russians stopped.
 They -- their excuse 
was that the -- the -- 
their supply line ended, but this was not 
true. They stopped because the Polish people 
wanted to  be very smart, and they wanted
, when -- as the Russian
s approached  Kraków, 
so they wanted to ma
ke the uprise, and the Germans were -- had involve with the Russian 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
50
 
 
 
front 10 divisions, so they fi
gured they were busy -- busy with
 the Russian front, and they 
will make the uprise, and they
 will establish an -- a free 
P o land government. But the 
Russians said well, they though
t we are fighting, and they didn™t want the Polish to 
establish a free Poland, which th e government 
was in exile in London
. Se -- they wanted 
to have a Co mmunist regime. So they stopp ed, and naturally then
 they withdrew, the 
Germans withdrew the 10 divisions, they brou
ght them to Warsaw, and they suppressed 
them -- their uprise, and -- and they killed 20
0 fighters, they kille
d 200 civilians. They 
didn™t kill them just like Jews, you take them
 to extermination camp, but they were killed 
fighting. And then they took 4
00 civilians, and they took th
em as prisoners. They put -- 
put to a town there, and -- and then -- then 
th -- about a few months
 later, the Russians 
made the last offensive, and they  occupied Wa
rsaw. So -- so -- so in 
con -- so tha -- all th-
the -- the -- the b -- the manage -- the big shot
s from the uprise, who were not killed, who 
were not taken as prisoners
, they moved th e whole headquarters from the uprise to 
Kraków. And th en Kraków had to be the sa
me uprise as in Wars
aw. When the Germans 
will leave, they want to make the uprise. So th
ey were in Kraków. So 
this was one also of 
the reasons that -- about the destruction, th
ey wanted to  make destruction we -- there 
were three reasons actually. The first reason wa
s that they wanted to make this destroy 
because they were afraid for a other uprise li ke in Warsaw. The seco nd reason in -- in -- 

was because they wanted to
 slow down the Russian a
pproach. If the town will be 
destroyed, so they will slow
 down. The third reason was b
ecause the Germans considered 
Kraków as a German town, and they cou -- lik
e they always -- like a
ll the scientists from 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
51
 
 
 
before, and they always said th
at they were Germans, not Polis
h. So they considered that 
this a Polish tow -- as a German 
to wn . An d  th en  wh en  
they -- they had to 
leave it, so they 
-- they didn™t want to leave it [indecipherable]
. They said well if we cannot have it, we 
will destroy it. So those were the three reas
ons, but actually the biggest reason was that 
they wanted to destroy the to
wn, because they couldn™t live 
with it that Po
land should get 
the town untouched. Because in
 Kraków there was never bomb,
 in Kraków was never the 
house destroyed, so they wanted  to destro
y the whole town. Now, would th is work , the 
287 mines, Kraków would -- not one house w
ould be left, because they -- the way they 
mined, and they put in the co
lumns, it was the whole town 
would be blown up. Naturally 
with the pe -- and people, there were 
hundred  maybe -- hu -- hu -- thousands, and 
thousands of people woul
d be killed. So -- so this was 
the reason, because the uprise had 
to be in Kraków the same way. 
Q: So how did your relations
hip with your now wife prog
ress? What did she in the 
meantime, while you were busy doing th is othe
r thing, and how did you come together 
then? 
A: Well, when -- when in th
is time, when I got the pl
ans, naturally she -- sh -- 
[indecipherable] our group, she was admired,  and -- and then the -- I -- I was busy with 

my -- with my things. Then 
one day -- yeah, the ne -- but 
in Kraków there was no food, 
because there was war, there wa
s no food, and then sh e didn™t 
have food. So the next day, 
or two days later, I took my  adjutant, a
nd -- and I -- and we had ev erything, so I 

remember I made the package salami, and 
-- and -- and -- and butter, and everything, I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
52
 
 
 
made the package and I send it to her. And she 
was there with her fr -- friend, the -- the -- 
this daughter-in-law from -- from the house. 
And wh en I send it to her, she wrote a n -- a 
note, she answered she got it, and -- and -- a
nd -- and -- and people 
who started to come 
out from hiding. And there were cases there 
I remember, there was one man, he was a 
lawyer, when he came out so th
at he walked like an animal, 
because he was two years he 
was laying like in a grave. So
mebody kept him, and he 
was under the floor, he was 
laying, he only came -- they fed him, gave
 him something, but he never came out. And 
people started to come out, they  didn™t have 
what to eat, because 
even the Polish people 
didn™t have what to eat. So she wrote me th at she needs more food
, she needs more food, 
so every day I raised -- see, I didn™t see he
r -- every day I raised instead -- yesterday I 
send her two loaves of bread, the next day I se
nd her four loaves of bread, one salami I 
send before, and each time I send it because I ha
d those things. And she wrote that she is 
giving th is to people who came out. And th
e people who came out find out that there is 
somebody who has food. So th ey 
came to us, and she gave them. So this went on fo r -- I 
would say about -- about two weeks in the -- 
I didn™t see her. So then one day -- one day 
i-in this building, where she was there, it wa
s the mo st beautiful and best section, Yu-
Yush alaya, that™s the -- the st
reet, Yush alaya, 98. It was on
 corner Ujaneetja street. And 
the German took over the be
st houses for their administration. So -- so the Polish 
government started to take over th-those ap
artments, and one day somebody came in, and 
they saw this apartmen t, was a beautiful apar
tment, and they took it over, and they said, 

ﬁWe confiscated apartment, you have to lo ok 
for another apartment.ﬂ So she notified me 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
53
 
 
 
that they taking away the -- 
the apart -- the apartment. So 
I -- I send over -- oh, I think I 
came over in this time, and I made out an -- 
an -- I typed out an -- a paper that I lived 
there, that I took over the 
apartment, I put it on the door. 
Once I put in door, nobody 
touched it, and she co uld stay there. I was not st
aying there, but this -- so then I didn™t see 
her again for a -- for a few weeks, and yeah 
-- and then she -- and -- and we started also, 
to arrest a lot of German volk
sd eutshen, and we took away th eir apartments and they left 
a lot of stuff, the apartment, so
 -- so I -- I gave her a lot of
 clothing what I got from the 
people, so every -- so I gave her that. About 
a few weeks later she came to my office and 
she said she had to register to
 the army, because in her year, 
she -- sh -- sh -- they had to 
register. They took women to th
e army, too. So -- and she didn
™t want to go, naturally, to 
the army . So I gave her papers
 that she works in my office 
-- she didn™t work
 in my office 
-- that she™s occupied. So
 she didn™t go to army , 
and then later I starte
d to go out with her, 
and then each time a little more
, and -- and this is how we st
arted, and -- to go out til -- til 
we were ready to -- to be married, but we 
didn™t get married in Kraków, we -- I was 
transferred to Breslau, and then she came after 
me to Breslau. So this was Kraków, but -- 
Q: Was it -- was it difficult to slowly relax in  times that were not quite normal yet, but to 
something sort of normal, like
 romance, to just to begin 
to feel like a human person? 
A: Well -- well, I will tell you this time was ve
ry -- I -- I welcomed the time, an d to be 
involved in it, becau
se after going through so much, 
and losing everybody, and here, 
later, life gave me a purpose. It gave me a 
purpose that this was Poland renewed, and like 
I told you, I always liked Poland, and -- and 
-- and I was important in this renewal, I was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
54
 
 
 
important in the rebuilding. So it gave me a 
very -- and I think this was one of my -- of 
the best times, and also -- also, it ga -- instea
d -- instead I -- like I ha
d to work, let™s say, 
eight hours. I wanted to  wo rk 16 hours. Why?
 Because it gave me opportunity to  -- to 
look for the people, fo
r the collaborators, and to put them
 behind bars, and to do things 
that -- that this was my dream. So I was very
 i-interested. Now, my 
superiors liked it. My 
superiors liked it because I was -- I did mo re
 that they asked from me, see? An-And I 
think I was capable in doing it, and -- and I 
-- each time I was praised more and more, 
and -- and -- in-in -- because I could produce 
more than they -- th
at they asked from -- 
from me. 
Q: So you had established -- 
you began to establish, or 
you had established a Polish 
identity [indecipherable] 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you -- did you, both of you then, la
ter, intend to stay 
in Poland, or how 
[indecipherable] 
A: Well, no. In this time, to stay in Pola
nd, I don™t think so  we intend. But we had a 
conversation between us, later, when we were 
in Breslau, we -- we -- we spoke between 
us, and maybe -- you see very -- you see once I -- I had this position, I always notified the 

leadership. There was a Jewish
 committee. T h ere were not too many Jews c-came back, 
but how many came back, they 
organized a committee. I went to the Jewish committee, 
to the president, and I told him, ﬁListen, I 
am a Jew. And anything you have a problem, 
come to me.ﬂ Because offici
ally they couldn™t do anythi
ng. Because officially the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
55
 
 
 
government, and officially all the people wh
o worked, in the -- even
 in our office, oh, 
everybody hated Jews. So I said, ﬁIf you had so
mething to do, and if there is so mething I 
can do unofficially, I w ill gladly do it.ﬂ An
d they knew that I™m 
-- a few people knew. 
And every time some thing happen
ed like this -- specially th
ere was one rabbi, his name 
was -- well, anyway, I have it written down. 

Q: Maybe it will come
 back to you. 
A: Yeah, it always ca -- so -- Steinberg, Moja, 
he was a son of a very  famous rabbi. Now 
he -- I told him I was a Jew, and he be
came the rabbi in Kraków, he was not from 
Kraków, he became the rabbi, and every time 
something happened, he
 came to me, he 
told me this. Unofficially I 
did it, not as a Jew, but I 
did it from my pos -- my -- my 
position. And I was very 
happy that I could help. So -- and 
I was officially as a non-Jew. 
And -- and once I am -- we had 
a discussion with my  wife, a
nd we said, ﬁWell, listen. 
Maybe it is time that we shou
ld remain,ﬂ we were already established. Now, she was 
accepted to the medical school, 
to the Univ ersity of Yagg
alonian. And this what she 
always wanted to be, a docto r. Now, you ar
e already accepted, and I have a -- well, 
important position. So maybe it™s time that 
we should cut off, but 
not being Jewish, and 
may -- who knows, maybe in 200 years will be
 another Holocaust then, and the -- and my 
-- our grandchildren wouldn™t ha
ve to be killed. So we had 
a discussion about it, and she 
said no, she cannot do it, b
ecause she had a sister, and a 
grandmother, and uncles in 
Palestine in this time, and sh e wouldn™t like 
-- she would like eventua
lly to go to them. 
Now, with me was a d ifferent story. I -- I 
had family in America, but it wou -- didn™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
56
 
 
 
mean so much to me. So, to 
me the different story I told 
her, I wouldn™t like to cut off 
because -- see, by Jews, there is a sect, we ca
ll it Cohamin, the priestly tribe. Now, the 
priestly tribe -- now I am -- the priestly trib
e started with Aaron, the brother of Moses. 
And this goes on for 4,000 years.
 The son becomes a priest af
ter the father, priest after 
the fa -- and it never changes. Now I -- my fath
er was from this tribe, and I am from this 
tribe. So I told her, said, ﬁIf 
this lasted 4,000 years, and 
I don™t know how many from my 
forefathers were killed because
 they were Jews. My father was killed because he was a 
Jew. Who knows, maybe his grandfather, his 
great-grandfather was killed because he was 
a Jew. So who am I that I should say by me
 I should cut the chain, and by me to say it 
stopped.ﬂ So  I said, ﬁI cannot do it, because if
 this lasted for so many thousan ds of years, 
there is something, and I wouldn™t like it s
hould be destroyed.ﬂ An
d for this reason we 
decided not to remain in
 Poland as Poles, that we have to
 go out, and we ha
ve to  continue 
to be Jews. And natu rally, our dream was to
 go to Palestine, we never dreamt about 
America. We ne -- we wanted -- specially me
, I wanted to go to Palestine because if 
somebody would tell me that see, I was in 
the underground, in the Polish army, if 
somebody will tell me that I woul
d be in Palestine, and I wo
uld be able to fight for a 
Jewish state one day, one day 
to have a rifle in my hand, 
and they will say the next day 
you will be killed, I will always agree .That if
 I could fight one day 
for my homeland, not 
for strangers, and then I could 
be killed, I would be very ha
ppy. So, we wanted to go to 
Palestine. So then there were the things -- 
reasons why we didn™t go 
to Palestine, because 
you couldn™t go that j -- if you 
was a -- were illegal. So they
 took the people, they send 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
57
 
 
 
them to Cyprus, so we said
 we™ll go to America, and -- and we will go to -- which one 
will come first, Palestine or America, a
nd then from America we can always go to 
Palestine. So we came to America, it™s a -- and a -- and a -- but -- but -- 
Q: But it wasn™t that simple, right, because Brauslav or Breslau was in the Russian zone, 

was it a [in d ecipherable] 
A: No, it wasn™t Russian -- 
Q: No. 

A: It was Polish, Poland occupied -- Brau
slov was -- Bre slau wa
s taken over Szalasia, 
then Neederslazin, and Obershlazin, this was 
part of Poland. It was not -- i-it was not the 
Russian zone of Germany, this was Poland. 

Q: Yeah, but it still w asn™t easy to 
get -- to get just out of there. 
A: No, we -- I escaped, no we -- I could -- speci
al I couldn™t go out because on account of 
my position. I remember I wanted -- see, I h ad 
a very good name in 
my -- in our outfit, 
and -- because I did mo re than 
they -- they ask. So
 then later, when -- 
when -- when they 
started to organize groups to -- to go to  Pales
tine, to fight, I wanted to -- they -- I just 
wanted to  get out legally, because I didn™t want
 to escape, because I didn™t want to spoil 
my name. So I remember there was a -- I ha
d a friend, he was a major in the Russian 
KGB, and I went to him, and I told him, ﬁLis
ten, I want to get out, and -- and how should 
I arrange it?ﬂ And now I didn™t know that he 
would betray me. He went to my superiors, 
and he told them that I want
 to get out. The next day th ey
 called me in, and there was a 
whole -- about 10 high officers, and one said, 
ﬁWell, I heard you will -- you want to get 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
58
 
 
 
out,ﬂ [indecipherable]. So he said, ﬁWell, we
™ll give you th ree choices that you can go 
out. The first choice is you take a revolver, an
d you shoot yourself. The second choice is, 
if you don™t like to kill yourself, we™ll send 
you to Siberia for 10 
years. And the third 
choice is you go back, [indecipher
able] march as you did today,
 you have to do 10 times 
a march, because til now we didn™t check you 
because we have confidence in you. But 
from now on, every step will be
 checked, every way we™ll check.ﬂ So I knew that -- that 
they will have an eye on me. And then, well, we decided that
 we have to get out, so we 
arranged to run away, so -- 

Q: How did you -- how did you  manage? 
A: Well, it™s a -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- it was [indecipherable], it™s a long stor
y. So I managed that. I run aw ay thro ugh 
Gearlies, but it™s a long story, so I run away
, and -- and after I run away, my  wife was 
arrested. They arrested her b
ecause they thought 
by -- by her being arrested, I will find 
out, I will come back to try to save her, so th
is way they did. But, they arrested her, and 
she claime d that I was not her husband, becaus
e we were never officially married there. 
Said [indecipherable] he -- I was a boyfriend,
 we were lovers, and now we -- I run away, 
and that™s it. So she was two weeks in jail, 
an d after two weeks of jail, there was -- the 
man who was in charge, he was the head of 
the whole --- the army of the whole state, 
said -- said that he will let you -- yeah, ther
e was a [indecipherable] of my wife, he was 
work ing in the ministry, and then he went to
 the head from the army , he said, well he 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
59
 
 
 
wants to take her out. So he said, ﬁWell,
 I will let her out if she will become my 
secretary.ﬂ So they let her ou
t, and then later she escaped. But the -- those are a lot of 
details, details, details, but this is how -- how it went.  
Q: Okay , so wh ere did you -- where did you 
meet again, where did you go first then? 
A: I -- I run away to Munich. First I went 
out to Berlin, and I wa
s in Berlin, and from 
Berlin, I -- see, I went -- I r
un through Gearlies, and then fro
m Gearlies I went to Berlin. 
And in Berlin I started to work, we -- we 
call it here -- we called it Bricha. This was a 
organization that it means escape. W -- I started 
to work in Poland in 
the Bricha, so we -- 
we took Jews who wanted to escape, andwe smuggled th em through the bord er. And 
then my job was, from Berlin
, I took the groups of Jews
 to Munich, because I -- we 
couldn™t take them to the American zone, firs
t I had to go from Munich. I -- I took them 
to the -- to the English zone
. I remember I made th-the
re some acquaintances in 
Ashfaiger, you know where that
 is? And th rough Ashfaiger we
 took them, and -- and then  
to Munich, and in Munich some
body else took over, and they 
took the Jews to Italy, and 
from Italy they smuggled them on ships, and th
ey were caught in Cy
prus. So I worked in 
-- in this Bricha a few months, then later I 
fin d  out my wife came
 [indecipherable] my 
wife came, so -- so we got an
 apartment in -- in Munich. An
d see, she wanted to go to 
school, but then later we figured we have to --
 we have to get out. So we registered -- we 
registered to -- to Palestine, what I just said
, to America. We said, 
which will be first, and 
there we™ll go. So America came first, and al
so, it was a very, very  big problem, because 
all the DPs who wanted to come to America, 
hardly  they could make it, because in the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
60
 
 
 
consulate -- in American consulate in Muni
ch, there was one woman, she was one of the 
secretaries, and she had some frien d, and they
 had a business. And then -- and then they -
- an-and there was a vice-consul, and he was 
also a partner, and ev
erybody who wanted 
to come in front of th e consul to have the 
application asking questio
ns, we had to pay her 
500 dollars. And people didn™t 
have 500 dollars, and if you 
didn™t pay 500 dollars, so 
they didn™t forward the -- th
e -- the papers. And -- and also
, when they came to the 
consul, the consul asked for birth certific
ates, and passports. Nobody had their birth 
certificate, I mean they were all su rvivor
s from the camp . So nobody could -- could go. 
So one -- and see my wife spok
e quite good English, she had si
x years English. So in this 
-- nobody could go and do something, so one 
day there was the -- the then chief consul, 
his name was Clark, in Munich, so we wa
ited -- we waited when he came back from 
lunch, so my  wife and I, we stopped him, and 
she started  to tell him the story, that Jews 
cannot go because first they had to pay money.
 And the second thing, who will have an -- 
a passport, a birth certificate? We came
 from concen tration camps. And she -- he 
listened, and wh en he listened, I rememb er 
she explained to him everything, then  later, 
after, when we stopped talking, so he went to
 us, and he put the hand on our head, he was 
a tall guy, yeah. So he said, ﬁDon™t worry. We
 need people like you in America.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁI will,ﬂ -- and he gave out new orders. 
First thing, he fired 
the secretary, and he 
gave out new orders that we
 don™t need from the concen tration camps -- people in 
concen tration, those documents, only wh at we 
need is two witnesses, that they know the 
person is from here and there, and this is suffi
cient. So the people started to come. Now, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
61
 
 
 
for instance, all the German people who made 
applications to go to 
g -- to America, they 
all got visas, because they had their papers, 
they could come in. An
d mostly people, their 
husbands were in -- in the army, in the SS, and 
then -- they all were welcome, so we told 
them all th ose things, that they -- why should th
ey have the priority, and after this, all the 
[indecipherable], it ended, then
 the people from the camps, they thanked us, that we made 
out that she is it -- they changed the whol
e law, and then we came to America. 
Q: This is the end of tape two, side  B, interview with Norman Salsitz. 
End of Tape Two, Side B 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Norman Salsitz. This is tape number three, tape A. So, I thought we are going to 
America, but we are not quite going to America. 

A: No, so then later wh
en we got the visas, so we had 
to go with groups with -- with 
survivors, and we were sent to Bremenha
ven. And in Bremen -- when we came to 

Bremenhaven in this time was a strike, a coal
 strike in America, and we supposed to 
leave Bremenhaven in June, 19
46, and we were in Bremenha
ven six months, til the strike 
finished, because they didn™t have coal. And 
we -- the -- we -- the strike was finished, and 
we started in Bremenhaven in January, 1947. 
So it was winter, and it was a very, very big 
storm, and -- and it was -- the voyage was te rrible, it took over tw
o weeks, and during 
that trip, the boiler broke in -- 
in the ship, it was a old liberty
 ship , and it took us over 12 -
- 14 days, and it was the -- everybody was very si
ck, especially I was ve
ry sick that I was 
-- and also, the DPs, the -- the Jew ish people  didn™t get the choice locations. Like, for 

instance, the German people, who got the vi
sas because they knew 
everybody, they had 
the documents, all of them had cabins, and then
 they -- they had the 
-- the -- the ch -- the 
-- the best accommodations, but the DPs, we di
dn™t pay for it, the Jo
int paid for it. So 
they put us in, and I was in 
the basement, in the basement 
there were about 150 people 
laying like -- like -- lik e rats. And my wife -- 
they gave them other cabins, there were 40 
women in one room. And I was so sick that I 
prayed  that the ship should sink, and -- and 
I didn™t eat anything, and it was -- I was terribl
e sick. And I figured -- and I really wanted 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
63
 
 
 
them -- we should finish  [ind
ecipherable].  Well, anyway s, my  -- s -- because I was laying 
in the basement, and -- so my wife, and -- 
she made up with the -- with the people who 
were in her room, that she came,
 she put in a kerchief of my
 -- my head. [clock chiming]. 
She put in a kerchief, she put 
in a housecoat, and she practic
ally carried me to her room, 
and I was sleeping with the -- in this room, 
which was much better than in the -- on the 
floor on the basement, and we came to, afte
r 14 days we -- the cap
tain announced that 
tomorrow we are entering New York. And I 
rememb er the whole night, because we 
didn™t know when, all the pe
ople were so excited, we coming to America, everybody 
pulled out his best suit, and the suits were ma
de in Euro pe, and with big lapels, with big 
white hair, you know, it was the best in 
Europe, but it was not like America. A nd 
everybody got dressed to kill. And we were
 standing on the deck
, waiting for the -- the 
Statue of Liberty. Finally [clock chiming] Fi -- 
Q: Well, that™s the bird, right on cue here. 
A: Okay, yeah. Finally, we -- we saw the Statue 
of Liberty, and this feeling, I don™t think 
that somebody can -- can describe this -- th
is feeling when we 
saw it. Everybody was 
standing there and crying, cause th is was all,they were all survivors, and finally we saw 
her. And everybody was nice dressed, and -- a
nd th -this was the mi nutes that we waited 
for. And we pulled into  the harb
or in New York, and then late
r we had to go down, and -- 
and then  in a very, very , very big hole, an
d all the people from -- fro m the whole ship, 
there were signs like all A, B, C, and ever
ybody went to -- to their initial, and they 
brought in th e suitcases what we had. And then
 as we are staying there, a man came in, a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
64
 
 
 
husky guy with a -- with the lu
mber jacket. And he goes around, an d then -- and he 
looked around where th
e initials are, and came to S, and 
he goes into my wife, and he 
said, ﬁMaybe you know where the -- some p e
ople name of Salishitz is.ﬂ She got very 
scared, and she pulled my  leg, 
she said, ﬁWell, they™re looki
ng fo r us.ﬂ We didn™t know 
who this is. So we were so afraid that ma
ybe something is wrong, maybe they will send 
us back, or something. So she 
didn't know what to say. Then la
ter, she said to him -- he as 
-- he ask her, ﬁDo you speak English?ﬂ She said
 yes. So he said, 
ﬁSo, do you know wh-
where the Salishitz is?ﬂ So sh e said, ﬁI am the Salishitz, a
nd th is is my husband. So 
what™s wrong?ﬂ He said, ﬁThere™s nothing 
wrong,ﬂ and he grabbed her and kissed her, 
and kissed me. He said, ﬁI am Yarkey. I am 
Yarkey, I am the son of Risel.ﬂ A nd Risel 
was my father™s sister, and this was her son 
Yarkey, who -- he became
 Jake in America. 
And he find out that -- that we are coming, 
so he came to  -- to wait for us. And all the 
people looked at us, they didn
™t know in beginning, th ey we
re afraid something happened 
beca -- then later when they se
e sa -- he said, ﬁDon™t worry, 
you don™t have to wait for a -
- for a -- for a -- the inspectors.ﬂ He called two longshoremen, they  took the suitcase, 

called sa -- called the inspector, gave a stamp  
with the -- others had 
to open the -- the -- 
the luggage, we didn™t. And he 
right away took us 
out in -- in the -- in
 the -- he took us 
out, and there was a car waiting in a place wher
e it™s -- w as not allowed to park, and there 
was my  brother waiting, and they took us aw
ay. Now, what happened, I didn™t know why 
he™s such a big shot, this -- this y -- uncle
, he came in a -- in ™99, said he had a 
luncheonette right near the piers, and -- 
and everybody who work
ed there, all the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
65
 
 
 
longshoremen, all the inspectors,
 they all -- they all ate th
ere. And -- and when  he find 
out we have to come, so he we
nt, and he waited for us. So it 
happens that I just wrote the 
story about it, because I want to send it 
to his daughter. So, an
d then we came to 
America, and -- and -- and we went to my  br
other, my  brother took us to his house. He 
had a house in Bensonhurst in Brooklyn. And we lived  with him about -- I would say 
about two, three we -- two weeks.  
Q: Now I do have some questions. 

A: Okay . 

Q: You hadn™t -- you hadn™t seen
 your brother for a long time? 
A: I -- my  brother left our hom
e before I was born -- before 
I was born, I never saw him, 
but in 1934 he came for a visit, an d this was th
e only visit he came, so
 I saw him in 1934.  
Q: How -- how well were they aware of what 
had happen ed in -- in 
Europe? Did you talk 
about that? [indecipherable] 

A: Yes, yeah, well, naturally we talked abou
t it, but then later, little b y  little it came out, 
they -- they say well they didn
™t know how m --  how -- how the whole situation naturally 
[indecipherable], but i -- so 
I -- I remember there was once a lecture in a temple, and 
rabbi and all of them, they said that th
ey didn™t know how terrible -- because I ask 
questions, like why didn™t you 
do more, when they ask me wh
at could we do. So I told 
them what they could do more. 
So they said they 
didn™t know about it. So I went -- the 
next day I went to the -- th-the
 Jewish pi -- to the forwas th
at is a Jewish forwas, and I 
picked out -- they had microfilms, and I pi
cked out microfilms fro
m the time where we 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
66
 
 
 
were destroyed, for the time of July ™42, Augu
st ™42. And every day, in the re -- paper 
every day were articles about 
what was going on, wh ich came porskal -- maybe it was not 
in the New York  Times, the New York  Ti
mes maybe there was something on the -- on 
page 18, a piece of this, but in
 the forwas, there was every day in ice -- I had my -- and 
then later, when we came to a next meeting, 
and when  the rabbi agai
n said so, I said to 
him, ﬁIt™s not true, because I just looked ov
er them, and that was mentioned every single 
day.ﬂ And we were very bitter, because in the 
beginning -- in the begi
nning the people in 
America didn™t want -- we started to tell st
ories, nobody wanted to  listen. And if 
somebody listened, they thought 
that we are -- we got nervou
s breakdowns, that the -- we 
told them stories that it is not true, beca
use how can somebody listen and imagine that 
somebody deliberately takes six 
million people and kill. It™s 
not -- and you talk about six 
million people like -- like a -- once I saw in th
e New York Times, an article on one page, 
six million Jews were killed. In
 the next pages, six million st
ocks were sold today on the 
stock market, in the same 
breath. So, w-w-w-we couldn
™t understand how -- people 
couldn™t believe it. Not only -- 
you see, when the Germans k
illed six million Jews, if they 
will kill the six million Jews the first day when
 they came in, it will be a terrible thing, 
they killed six million people, but it will not be
 so terrible. The terrible thing is for six 
years they tortured the peop le. They starved them, they 
beat them, they died from 
sickness, and all those things. Then, on the t
op, then finally, they 
killed them. Take for 
instance the Jews who survive 
concentration camps. Jews we
re in Auschwitz, some for 
three, four years. And th
en later, when the Russians 
were already next to the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
67
 
 
 
concen tration camp, they had to be liberated, 
they took them on dead marches that all of 
them died. Being th ree, four years in the 
camp, without food, and they had to walk 
without clothing, in this cotton dress, wit
hout underwear, without 
shoes, without food. 
And if somebody fell down  because it was sli
ppery, even  no f -- s-- strong people they 
would fell down . The minute they fell down, 
he was shot. Now, the German soldiers, 
they were all dressed in fur jackets, in fu
r coats, with heavy boots and everything, and 

they went with them. He
re they had to be liberated. So th
is is the cruelty. They had to -- 
they had to take them on marche s to be killed. So this killi
ng was not so terrible if they 
would do it the first day, but after six days
 -- six years, to be 
destroyed. Take, for 
instance, Demjanjuk. You know th e story about De
mjanjuk, that he was a guard in tr -- in 
Belzyce, he was the man who operated -- 
and in Treblinka, w
ho operated the gas 
chambers th-there. Now, Demjanjuk, his bigge
st pleasure  was when 
they brought in the 
Jews, and they were naked, an
d th ey walked through the maze
, to go in in the dead ca -- 
t-to the gas chamber, to the -- to the room. De
mjanjuk and others like him, were standing 
there laughing, and everyone -- every time wh
en  they  saw a young 
girl, with the firm 
breast, yeah, they went and cut 
off the breast, or stabbed there. Al -- it™s a -- it was a joke. 
They knew that in
 15 minutes this person will be killed,
 but before the person was killed, 
they had to stab her, they had to cu t off he
r breast. Those are the terrible things, the 
cruelty. The cruelty was -- now I™m ri -- r
eading a book, Treblinka, and the cruelty in 
Treblinka is that every day they  brought in 
transports, thousands and thousan ds of people. 
The people who worked there, 
they couldn™t lift up their head
, they had to run with their

head down. Why? Because there were speci
al people, special Germans and Ukrainian 
helpers, that they hit them w
ith -- with -- with some sticks
, or with some rubber hoses, 
and the minute -- and at night, when there wa
s the appelle, when th
ey was the roll call, 
and when  they saw somebody ha
d a sign on his face, he was ta
ken, they called it to the 
hospital, to be liquidated. So  they had to ru
n around with their head
 down th ey shouldn™t 
be marked. So the cruelty was so terrible. It
™s not the killing, but 
now how can people be 
so cruel that you take a guard, let™s say, in
 Auschwitz. A whole day he goes and he kills 
the children, but he had there his wife with 
his children. At night he went over and he 
played with his children, w
ith his dog, with  his cat. Li
ke -- like nothing happen ed. And 
the next day again he went ou
t, and he killed. There were
 people who went over to 
Vienna for the weekends. A whole week they
 were staying in a concentration camp, 
killing, killing, killing. And then
 for the weekend he goes home,
 he goes to the opera with 
his wife. He goes to parties with his wife, he 
goes to dances with his wife. He enjoys his 
children during that weekend, 
and Monday morning he goes ba
ck and he kills again. So 
how can you imagine that there are people on this world that
 they are not -- they are not 
human beings, and they are not even animal
s, because animals wouldn™t do a thing like 
this. But they did it day after day, year af
ter year, kill -- they k
illed six million innocent 
people. And they played around
 with their children,
 they were beautiful children. Their 
children were beautiful, but the 
Jewish children had to be kille
d. This is the tragedy. The 
tragedy is that how people can 
do things like this, and what 
made them do? After all, the 
German people didn™t come out from tha -- 
from jungles. They  didn™t come out from 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
69
 
 
 
underground, this was not 5,000 years ago. 
Even 5,000 years ago people wouldn™t do it. 
Now this was the 20
th
 century. The 20
th
 century, a nation who created a Getta, who 
created a Schiller, who created a Mozart, who 
created such -- such geniuses? How could 
a nation j -- sink so low, and th en later you sp
eak to th em, you sp -- I -- I feel bad I™m 
talking this to you, because -- 
Q: That™s -- that™s all right. 
A: How could pe-people sink so lo
w that later they don™t want ev
en to talk about it. It™s a 
little like nothing happened. There is even joke
s. Jews make jokes, and they live with 
their jokes. When  Eichmann was called -- and 
he caught, you know, 
he was brought to 
Jerusalem,  and naturally you kn
ow wh at happened  to Eichmann.
 So he said to the Jews, 
ﬁJews, what™s wrong with you, can™t you take
 a joke?ﬂ For him it was a joke. Six million 
Jews, this was a joke. The Hungarian Jews, 
400,000, it was almost after the war, they 
knew that they will be defeat
ed, they still had to take the Hungarian Jews, 400,000 to  
Auschwitz, and to destroy th em. They knew thei
r war is lost, why di
d they do it? When 
they come to a camp, that the Russians were
 already shelling the camp, they had to take 
them out, and put them in in a barn, close th
e doors, and put the barn on -- on -- on fire, 
and to kill them. The Ru
ssians were already there, why di
d you do it? Why did you have 
to kill them? People say, ﬁWell, it™s only the le aders.ﬂ It™s not the leaders. I don™t know if 

you read Go ldhagen™s book. Go ldhagen wrote a 
book, and he say -- he called it that the 
willing -- ﬁHitler™s Willing Executioners.ﬂ And he 
described, those were ordinary people. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
70
 
 
 
There is a other book, ﬁOrdin
ary People,ﬂ written by -- by Br
onig, and he describes it -- 
did you read the ﬁOrd inary People,ﬂ no? 
Q: Yes, I did. 
A: Yeah, so ordinary  people. Home he was a 
-- a -- a barber, he was a mason, then they 
took him over to Poland, and wh
at did they do? They were not 
forced to kill. If he had an 
excuse not to be killed, they didn™t do anythi
ng to him. But they wa
nted to show to kill 
more, to show off for his friends. And those we
re ordinary people, those were not people 
who were trained to be murderers. They™re no
t people who were -- it™s special to schools, 
like for instance who -- in -- in Ukrainian pe
ople, there was a school in Travniki, in 
Poland, there was a camp  in Travniki, and 
this school was a special school to teach 
guard s how to be cruel in a concentrati
on camp. And if somebody graduated from 
Travniki, he was a bigshot. Wh at did they  teac
h him? Teach him how to be cruel, how to  
kill. Demjanjuk was a graduate from Travniki
. Now he said he doesn™t know anything 
about it, he was a victim, he was in the Russi
an as a prisoner. So this what we cannot 
understand, how people, normal people in the 20
th
 century, intelligent people -- now, take 
for instance the Einsatzgr
uppen, you know what the 
Einsatzgruppen are. The 
Einsatzgruppen are, when they
 took over the Russian terr
itory, they didn™t send the 
people to concentration camps. When they to
ok over a town, the Ei
nsatzgruppen came in, 
and they killed all the Jews. Th
ey made ditches, they kille
d them, women, children, old 
men, everybody. Now the Einsat
zgruppen were volunteers. Th
is was not soldiers that 
they said well, you have to go to  the 
Einsatzgruppen, all volunteers. And wh ich 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
71
 
 
 
volunteers? Mostly were graduate -- people 
who graduate high sc
hool, who graduate 
musi -- in universities, who 
had professions; lawyers, do
ctors, they were in the 
Einsatzgruppen. No w, how can people who we
re educated become such murderers? 
People ask me now questions. What do you th
ink about the second generation, what do 
you think ab out the new generation? I said
, ﬁIf the new generation knows what their 
parents did, what their grandparents did, 
maybe they would unde
rstand something.ﬂ But 
they don™t know, because  the grandparents and the parents don™t want to speak about it. 

They are quiet. Nobody was in the Einsatzg
ruppen, nobody was in
 the Gestapo, nobody 
was in the SS. The SS was only volunteers, th
e volunteers in the SS. Now, people say -- 
everybody say -- now I have a speech now 
-- everybody -- everybody says, well, this 
what the Nazis did, this what the Nazis did. 
I am very angry. I never use the word Nazi. 
And if you see my  book, in my
 book you don™t have once a 
Nazi. And I always ask that 
question, why do you say Nazi
? There were 90 million Germans, eig h t million belonged 
to the party, which you can 
tell them, they were members of the Nazi party? What 
happened to 82 million? So 82 million we
re staying home and saving Jews? What 
happened to the 82 million? So
 I said, you don™t have to sa
y Nazis did it, the  Germans 
did it, with their collaborators. Nazis were in 
the party. Okay , some had bigger jobs, some 
had smaller jobs, but the Germans did it. An
d I am very much -- every time w h en I go 
and somebody has a speech, an
d he talks borgas about Nazi
s, I always get up, and I 
always say please, don™t use Nazis. And I te
ll them why. I tell, becau se the Germans did 
it. In the beginning maybe there were some 
G ermans who were against Hitler. They were 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
72
 
 
 
Communists, they were Socialists, but then
 later, everybody was pro-Hitler, why not? 
Hitler went to ge -- to France. They didn™t 
have cognac so much. 
They brought over all 
the cognac to fran -- from Fr
ance. They  didn™t have en
ough butter, they went to 
Denmark, to Ho lland, brought over all the bu
tter and the cheese, and 
they gave it to the 
people. They went -- they didn™t
 have wheat, they didn™t have 
corn, rye. They
 went to the 
Ukraine, brought over everythi
ng from the Ukraine. They  didn™
t have coal, they went to 
Poland, they brought ov
er everything from Poland. So natu
rally the one who were against 
him, later they became 
-- they were in love with him. 
Why? Because they had br -- butter, 
they have co gnac, they had bread, they had 
everything. Why? Because they took it away  
from the people. Money? They had plenty  of 
money. They had special people, they called 
them the dentists. In every 
concen -- d-death camp, after 
they killed the people, there 
were special people, they knocked out the gol
d teeth, and they got 
tons of gold, which 
they send it to Switzerland, an
d they exchange it for money. 
Whenever you start to think 
about all those things, I mean, they fit, but 
a human being, can a human being th ink about 
it, that a thing like th
is happened in the 20
th
 century?  
Q: Going back to your 
early time in America -- 
A: Okay , okay. 
Q: -- when people did not wa
nt to hear much about it -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- and couldn™t quite believe it either, or c
hose not to know the whole picture, did you 
s -- did you find that in -- true for the Jewi
sh American community , as well as for --  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
73
 
 
 
A: Yes, yes, I accuse the Jewish community 
also, because -- and I give you exan -- again 
example. Now, I accuse that 
from all the American presiden
t, the worst president in 
United State was Roosevelt, be
cause Roosevelt could do so mu ch, he could save so many 
Jews, he didn™t. He didn™t. He said -- ther
e was a interview with Jan Karski, a Polish 
runner from Poland what came 
to him, and he even desc
ribes the way Roosevelt was 
sitting. So Roosevelt was sitting smoking the ci
gar, and he said, ﬁAfter the war, we will 
punish the guilty, after the wa
r.ﬂ But during the war he di
dn™t do anything. You know 
how many Jews could be
 saved? The Jews were one -- th-they -- from friends, when -- 
when  it was the Vichy government that wanted 
to send all the Jews 
to north Africa, the 
American govern ment didn™t let them do it. There was a cordy -- Hill, he was the 
Secretary of State. He didn™t allow it, for tw
o reasons. The first reas
on, he didn™t want to 
annoy the Arabs, so le
t the Jews be killed. And then he said we could not afford -- we 
didn™t have enough trucks. They let the Jews 
be killed. Now, I™ll give you an example. I 
had a brother in America, my  brother was here
 from 1920. When we were in the ghetto in 
our small town, once we received a package fro
m Turkey, in the ghetto, and we didn™t 
know who sent the package, an
d di -- they delivered the pack
age, and this 
was a package 
that there were things that we never dreamt 
that this exist in the 
world. There was a can 
of coffee, there was a package 
of cheese, two packages of c
hocolate, two sar -- packag es 
of sardines. So I -- sugar, everyt
hing was in this packag e. My 
mother rece -- two salamis. 
My mother rec -- when we received it, she to
ok the salami, she™s -- p u t in slices, and 
everybody tried got a slice. We got this pack
age, every -- the whole town envied us. We 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
74
 
 
 
got the -- we didn™t know from wh ere the pa
ckage cames, came 
from Turkey. When I 
came to America, I ask my brother, ﬁDid you ev
er send a package to us?ﬂ He said, ﬁYes, 
there was once in the paper, th
at for 15 dollars, you can buy a package in Turkey, and it 
will be sent anyplace in Europe.ﬂ So he went
 and he paid 15 dollars
, and they sent the 
package. I ask him, ﬁHow 
many packag es did you send?ﬂ He said one. Why one? He 
said, ﬁWell, I didn™t receive an answer that
 you received it.ﬂ I said, ﬁWe were in the 
ghetto.ﬂ I ask him, ﬁCould you afford every da
y to send 50 dolla -- 15 dollars?ﬂ He said, 
ﬁYes, business was wonderful, we did a lot of 
business during the war.ﬂ I ask him, ﬁDid 
you go to the theater?ﬂ Yes. ﬁD
id you go to th e movies?ﬂ Yes. ﬁDid you go during the 
war to restaurants? How much cost a dinner 
in the restaurant? Couldn™t you take every 
day 15 dollars and throw it 
out? Maybe, maybe somebody would received it. But you 
didn™t do it. You sent one packag e, and we
 received it.ﬂ Imagine if we would receive 
every day a package. Not only we, the whole 
fami ly would have everything, we could 
sell it. Nobody did it. Th
en he, when I came over here, he cried. He had five sisters, all 
the sisters are dead. I said, ﬁW
hat did you do to save the sist
ers?ﬂ ﬁI -- what could I do?ﬂ I 
gave him 20 things that he 
could do. He didn™t do it.  
Q: Tell me -- tell me a few. 

A: All right, tell me a few. The first thing, 
before the war, when we
 knew already what™s 
going on in Germany, we wrote letters, we 
begged him, send us an affidavit. Nobody 
send it back. You know how mu ch  it would co
st him to send affidavit? 25 cents. Why 25 
cents? He had to notarize the affidavit. If he 
would do work with th
e bank, the bank will 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
75
 
 
 
notarize it for free. If he wouldn™t do work with
 the bank, he would go to the drugstore, 
the [indecipherable] 
was a notary, and he will ask him to
 sign, he pay 25 cents. So for 25 
cents, he could send affidavit. He didn™t se
nd affidavit, we asked him. And the same 
thing the other family members, 
too. This is the first thing. 
They knew what™s going on in 
Germany, nobody th ought about bringing ove
r somebody. They lived
 in freedom i-in 
America. A f -- during the war, packages. They
 could pay in packag es. Then th e other 
thing I ask them, ﬁDid you ever think about it,
 you did business a lot, to go to Turkey , to 
go to  Sw itzerland, to go to any neutral country,
 and to be there, and maybe for money, to 
bribe, to give some German official mone
y, and he could do something so mebody sh ould 
come out.ﬂ There were Jews who did it. I 
know rabbis who were taken out during th e 
time from ghettos, because they
 had followers here. They ha
d followers in America, and 
they went out and th ey bribed
. Germans liked money. Fo-F or
 -- for money you could do a 
-- the Gestapo could be bribed. I said, ﬁWhy
 didn™t you go, you -- you were here making 
-- making money, why didn™t you go there to
 Turkey? In 
Turkey there were special 
Germans that they made arrangements. You pa
id them off, you coul
d bring over the famil 
-- or some from the family. You didn™t do 
it.ﬂ ﬁI didn™t think about it.ﬂ ﬁNow you are 
crying they are dead? Now when
 I survived already the war, 
I wrote to you -- I wrote to 
you to send me affidavit, did you send me an
 affidavit? No. This was already after the 
war. So the Joint Distribution Committee had to 
send me affidavit, a
nd they paid for the 
affidavit. I had a brother here. You didn™t do
 it.ﬂ A other thing. My  -- I had a -- I had a 
brother-in-law, and he came from a ver -- fro
m a rabbinical family. And once, in 1937, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
76
 
 
 
one of the rabbis came for a visit to us. And 
he was his cousin . When  he went back, so 
my  brother-in-law said to him, ﬁYou know, my
 wife has uncles, one is a doctor, one is a 
dentist, one is a manufacturer. See if they 
could send us the affidavits.ﬂ He went to 
America, and we didn™t hear anything. So  we 
-- he wrote a letter to this rabbi, he said, 
ﬁWell, we asked th -- we asked you to  see the 
family.ﬂ He said, ﬁI saw the family. I called 
them, they didn™t answer. I went
 to their home, and I told th
em the whole story, that you 
want to come, you want to go, you are a neph
ew with  your wife, with the children.ﬂ Bu t 
nobody did anything. They  didn™t say anythi
ng, and th ey didn™t send you affidav -- only 
what they needed is affida 
-- and they were rich, they co
uld do it. So  you see, you ask 
about the Jewish community, 
the Jewish community didn™t do an ything. There was only 
one s -- group of the Jewish community , it™s ca
lled -- oh, I -- I -- you see, I forgot the 
names, I -- I know [indecipherable] all right. 
There was a religious group, they were very 
religious Jews, and they got together -- Vadats
alla, this was the name
. The Vadatsalla got 
together money, and they sent over a delegation, and pulled few people to th e countries 

what I told you. And if they had outsta
nding Jews, outs -- Jews, 
I mean rabbis, they 
brought them out from there. And they are 
survived , they send money. No w how come 
the Vadatsalla, a group of religious Jews could 
do it, and other Jews couldn™t do it? Then 
we had here a rabbi who was in charge of 
Zionist organizations. No
w when  they find out 
from Switzerland that Hitler is killing all the 
Jews -- and they find it out, by the way, 
from a German industrialist in Switzerland. He ca
me -- he couldn™t take it, and he went to 

the representative from the Join
t in swi -- in Switzerland, and he told them the whole 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
77
 
 
 
story. He sent telegrams to England, tele
grams to America, telegrams to Roosevelt. 
Roosevelt called Rabbi Weiss, who was in charge
, and he said to Rabbi Weiss, ﬁLet™s not 
rock the boats.ﬂ And everything was quiet. Th
is man told him ever
ything what happened 
in the concentration camps, inthe death camps. They said, ﬁL
et™s not rock the boats,ﬂ and 
nothing was done. So you blam
e, naturally, the Germans, 
they did it. You blame the 
collaborators, the Ukrainians, the Croatians, 
the Slovaks, the Lith
uanians, the -- the 
Latvians. They all did it. But the American 
Jews didn™t do what th
ey  supposed to do. 
Q: This is the end of tape three, si
de A, interview with Norman Salsitz. 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview 
with Norman Salisitz. This is ta
pe number three, side B. I wa
nted -- I wanted to ask you, 
Norman, what became of the re
lationship with your brother? 
A: The relationship of my  brother was -- we
ll, it was never a relationship like brothers, 
because he didn™t know me, I 
didn™t know him. But when I ca
me, I wanted to know him, 
after losing my whole family. But it was never 
-- for instance, I needed a job. I came over 
here without money, without knowing th e langua
ge, without having a trade, so I needed -
- and also, I wanted -- my pride i -- was that 
I wanted to show that
 I can do something. 
Now, he had a big business, he had a tr --a trucking business, and I asked him, after I 
couldn™t get a job, I ask him he should employ me. So his excu -- his answer was -- he 
had a foreman, and the foreman told him -- no
w, he was the boss, but the fo reman told 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
78
 
 
 
him well, he shouldn™t give me a job, because 
when  they will have to
 deliver packages to 
stores, and my English is not so well, so how
 will I deliver the packages? So this was his 
excuse. In Poland, afte
r the war, being 25 years, I could rose to a rank of a lieutenant 
colonel. But here, to deliver packages, I 
was not good, because I wouldn™t read the 
addresses. So, it was not like -- like it should 
have been  done, but according to the other 
family  me mb ers, h e was g ood
, because the other family me
mbers were worse. I mean 
uncles, cousins, who were Americans. I give
 you a -- examples. I had -- my father had a 
first cousin here, his name was Showel Salish itz, he became one of the largest silk lining 
manufacturers. If some body had a 
fur coat, the silk, the lining
, came from his fa -- he had 
seven factories. He retired when I came, the 
children took over the 
-- the business. I went 
over to him with one uncle, 
I had one uncle was very nice
, he was the poor uncle, he 
never made a living. He didn™t have time to
 make a living becaus
e everything was on his 
head. So he went over with me, and we went over, and so it was a Sunday  mo rning, so he 

said, ﬁYou know, I don™t own th
e business, my son Saul has the business. But if you will 
go to  him, he probably would give you a jo
b, because we have 
300 people wo rking by 
us.ﬂ I went over to him, was on a Sunday mornin
g, I put in my  best 
suit, a European suit. 
It was not so fashionable in America, but fo
r me it was good. I came in, and there was the 
receptionist, a beautiful, blonde girl. And she 
ask me what I want. So I said to her as 
much as I spoke English, that I want to 
see Mr. Salishitz. ﬁWho should I say is calling?ﬂ 
So I said, ﬁTell him it™s his cousin from Euro
pe.ﬂ After a few minutes she took me in. He 
was sitting by a bis -- big desk, 
and I came in, I never saw him before. He ne -- he didn™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
79
 
 
 
get up, he didn™t give me a ce
nt. And he was lick -- he looked
 at me, he said, ﬁWhat can I 
do fo r you?ﬂ I says, ﬁWell, I saw you father ye
sterday, and I™m lookin
g for a job, and he 
is my  father™s first cousin, so that mean
s we are second cousin s, we have the same 
name.ﬂ This was before I changed the name. ﬁS
o, he said you probably could give me a 
job.ﬂ He looked at me, didn™t say anything, 
he took out his wallet. 
He took out from the 
wallet a hundred  dollar bill. He put it on the de
sk, and he said, ﬁTake it and get off my 
back.ﬂ When he said it to me
, I co uldn™t answer anything. 
I wanted to cry, but nothing 
came out. My eyes filled up with tears, and I 
looked at him, and the minute I looked with  
him -- at him, so I imagined w -- how would we
 be if he would co me to Poland for a visit 
when I was in the military? 
And I imagined that I would make a special review, I will 
stay on the -- on the -- on the reviewing sta
nd with him, the army
 will go through, the 
music will play, I will salute, 
and I will introduce this is my
 cousin from America. He 
said -- the money was laying on 
th e floor -- on th e table. Then  he said, ﬁWell, on th e 
second th ought, I will give it to the United Je
wish Appeal, let them 
do what they  want.ﬂ 
And he took it and put it back in his wallet.
 I run out, and as I came in, where this 
receptionist was sitting, I burst out, not with a cry, I burst out like with a sob, like some 
[gasps]. I couldn™t cry, I couldn™t [inaudible
].  She said, ﬁWhat happened, wh at happened ? 
Should I call a doctor?ﬂ I said no, and I went 
out to the hallway, and 
when I staying in the 
hallway, and I was crying. I was 27 years ol
d. A man goes through, he sees I™m staying 
there and crying, he said, ﬁHey mister, what
™s wrong?ﬂ And I said to him, ﬁAre you 
Jewish?ﬂ He said yes. I  said, ﬁI wi sh you w
ould be in Auschwitz.ﬂ He said, ﬁWhy are you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
80
 
 
 
sending me to Auschwitz?ﬂ I said
, ﬁWhy should my father be
 killed because he™s a Jew, 
and you are sitting here, you ha
ve everything, and 
you are not being killed.ﬂ And I tol -- I 
don™t know why I told him this. I was -- when
 I came out, I was so bitter. So he said, 
ﬁHey mister, wa -- I w ant to know why you™re 
telling me this.ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t want to 
talk to you.ﬂ Well, all those stories I have in
 this new book. He sa
id to me, ﬁDo you eat 
lunch?ﬂ I said no. I said, ﬁCome with me to ea
t lunch.ﬂ I went with him, we went down  to 
a -- to a cafeteria, he ask me what I want, I 
said, ﬁNo, I will have the same thing as you 
have.ﬂ He ordered, I remembe
r, and I will never forget, he or
dered topcheese, sour cream, 
and ch opped vegetable, radishes, and onions
, and ev erything mixed 
up. He had it, I had 
it, it was w o nderful. I a -- ate it, h e said to 
me, ﬁDo you want a other one?ﬂ I said no. He 
said, ﬁNow, tell me the story.ﬂ 
So I told him the story about 
this. So happens that this 
man was a buyer in their comp any. He knew 
him. He says, ﬁWhat I want is you should 
go with me up there, and you shou
ld punch this son of a bitch 
in his mouth, and I want to 
see blood. Don™t worry, nothing 
will happen to you, I will be with you.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, I 
don™t want  to go, but the one thing I can prom
ise you is that so long as I will live, I will 
never speak to him again.ﬂ He said -- we fini
shed, he said, ﬁHere is my card. Come and 
see me.ﬂ But a few days later I came and 
saw him -- I remember his name was Louie 
Segal. See, things like this 
you don™t forget. I came to him,
 and he was a converter. You 
know what a converter, they -- 
they send over raw material 
to be dyed, and everything, 
but anyway -- and he sold remnants. In this
 time I say remnants™s, because there was a 

lot, it™s remnants™s. One is a remnant. I didn™
t know th at you say [indecipherable]. So he 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052

said to me, ﬁI will give you every week a case
 of remnant, and will charge you what I pay 
for it, 45 cents a pound.ﬂ He gave me a addre
ss where to go and sell it. He said, ﬁYou go 
and sell it, and they  will pay you th ree dollars
 50 a pound.ﬂ He could sell it, he sold his. 
He gave me a case of remnant, I picked it up,
 and I went to those people. I made -- every 
week I made a few hundred dollars. He did 
it every week. He was a stranger. Every time 
I came to him, he said, ﬁI still want you should 
go with  me to this son of a bitch.ﬂ Always 
he said this. Then later some
thing happened  th at he did something, it was not hundred 
percent, he lost all his connections, and I was 
out of it. Do -- yeah, so I™m tellin g you an -
- a episode from my  family. Tell you other ep
isodes when  I came over. So my  family 
started in what should we do
 -- they called me the boyjik. You know, in Yiddish you say, 
a boy, a boyjik, yeah . They  got together to
 think how they  shoul
d do -- I should make a 
living. And they brou
ght me to a uncle whose son ha
d the big factory from bluebell 
dungarees. You heard about blue baga -- bell -- 
well, a b ig factory. So they were sitting 
there from the family, started to
 talk, then, what should we do with  him. So, the first thing 
is, we have to change his name, because he
 cannot have a name 
like Salishitz, a long 
name. So the family had different names, th
e family -- some had Sa
les, some h ad Sallis, 
some had Sanders, some had Saleeshi. All diffe
rent names. They didn™t get along with 
them, they didn™t want to have the same 
name . My brother™s name was Salsitz, I said 
Salsitz. Now the first name. What should be 
-- my  name  was Naftali, Naftali™s not fo r 
America. Well, the name -- maybe we should 
make it from Nathan, for short is Nat. I 
didn™t like the word Nat, becau
se Russia, nyet means no, everyt
hing is no. So I said, ﬁNo, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
82
 
 
 
I don™t like it.ﬂ Norbert, there was alread -- 
there was already a Norbert, because every 
bro -- see, my  father had seven sisters andbrothers, all of them had children the same  
age, and when my grandfather 
died, Naftali, everybody had 
his son Naftali. So one was 
Norb ert, no good, one was Nolan, so Nolan. 
And so on, and so on. 
So one said, ﬁWell, 
what™s about Norman?ﬂ So I ask him, ﬁNorman?ﬂ ﬁYeah.ﬂ Nathan , Nat, what I didn™t 

like, so one said, ﬁWell, how mu ch  can he 
make by a name, Nathan? The most he can 
make 35 dollars a week.ﬂ So I ask him No
rman, how can Norman -- oh, Norman™s a 
better -- nice name, you can go up to 65 dollars
. So I started to think in my head, I will 
live til 80 years, and I will make 30 dollars 
a week more by having
 the name Norman, 
just for the name I™m g o ing to die a millionaire.
 So I said, ﬁI want to have Norman.ﬂ They 
gave me Norman. So my name 
was Norman Salsitz. Then they 
said, ﬁYou have to have a 
cemetery plot. In America everybody has to 
have a cemetery plot.ﬂ So  I said, ﬁI™m 27 

years old.ﬂ ﬁNo, there is a saying in America,
 the saying is, it™s better to have and not to 
need it, than to need it and not
 to have.ﬂ They  had a family 
cemetery plot, they sold me 
four plots. I didn™t have child
ren. Four plots for 300 dollars
, you can pay it up. I still have 
it. Four -- solda -- cemetery plot. Then  later a job. The mo st important thing, how™s about 
a job? So  one uncle said, ﬁWell, you know, it wo
uld be nice if he could be a salesman for 
the company.ﬂ So the others sa
id, ﬁA salesman? He doesn™t sp
eak English, how can he go 
and [indecipherable]?ﬂ Then  on
e said, ﬁHe can be a cutter.ﬂ 
So the other one said, ﬁA 
cutter? In the union? He will 
never get in the union.ﬂ Then 
one said, ﬁA designer.ﬂ Well, 
anyway, everything was the uni
on, the union. So one uncle 
was smart, and a cousin, he 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
83
 
 
 
said, ﬁWell, if he can be a machine -- a ma 
-- to fix mach -- yeah, 
a machinist.ﬂ No good. 
To fix machines he can be a independent cont
ractor, he doesn™t need the union, and he 
can fix the machines from your factory.
 Wonderful. So one 
said, ﬁDo you know 
something about machin
es?ﬂ I said, ﬁThere is one machin
e that I can take the machine 
apart blindfolded, I can put it together b
lindfolded, I know this mac h ine through and 
through.ﬂ ﬁGood, good, is it  a 
Singer machine?ﬂ I said no. ﬁS
o what kind of machine is 
it?ﬂ I said, ﬁA machine gun.ﬂ Wh
en I said a machine gun, th
ey all got quiet, and they 
knew -- because I knew I wouldn™t get the job 
from them. So I walk
ed out with a new 
name, with four pem -- pr -- family plots, no job. 
Q: Where did -- where did you stay at a
ll -- all this time? With your brother? 
A: Oh, with my brother. 
Q: Still with your brother. 
A: Yeah, yeah, it was my brother, yeah.  
Q: And your wife was there? 

A: Yeah, yeah [indecipherable] 

Q: Did your brother ca -- Lyebish, did he co me to America? 
A: No, he came about a half a year later, yeah
. So  -- so wait. So -- so I no job, but I had a 
problem with my name, with my
 second name, with Salsitz, I 
have a big problem. Later, I 
went in, I be -- I got jobs. I got, during the fi
rst year, I g o t about 10 jobs. Most of the jobs 
I was fired, cause I have a big mouth. S -- I 
wanted to tell the boss 
something to improve 
something, he said, ﬁWho th e hell are you to  te
ll me  to improve something?ﬂ I was fired.

Then later I became a peddler, you know what 
a peddler is? I used to sell from house to 
house things. There™s a stories about the peddle
r, I think. So then  later I -- from peddler I 
advanced, I sold first socks, 
then later dresses, t-til I be
came -- I sold furniture, only 
furniture, I had a warehouse. So there was 
one man, he was a manufacturer of -- of 
furniture, I remember his name
 was Horowitz. He had his office on Canal Street in New 
York. So I went in, I wanted
 to buy so me furniture. So 
the girl ask me down -- said, 
ﬁWhat™s your name?ﬂ So I said, ﬁI -- I™m Mr
. Salsitz.ﬂ S o  the way she heard it, she 
thought I said that I am Mr. Saul Shit, 
because they wen -- so she calls up the man 
upstairs, and I could hear it, she said, ﬁThere is
 a man, but his name is Saul Shit.ﬂ I went -
- so -- so I -- so she said to
 me, ﬁGo up,ﬂ and I went up. So
 the man had to me -- to say -- 
and I heard what she said, so sh
e said, ﬁIt™s n ice to see y ou, mister -- it™s nice to see you 
mister,ﬂ -- So I said to him, ﬁYou can call me
 by first name.ﬂ ﬁSaul, it™s a pleasure.ﬂ And 
everything I wanted from this ma n, he did it be
cause I told him he sh
ould call me my first 
name, so he didn™t have to call me my  last 
n ame, Mr. S h it. So this was -- those are the -- 
the -- the -- the -- the s -- in the beginning, 
what I -- I told you th
ere are some comical 
stories, but there -- there are -- it™s true stor
ies. And -- and -- and -- and this is how -- and 

then later, after I was a peddler, about -- about
 10 years, then later I became a devel -- a 
builder. I got -- I got a customer, he was a It
alian guy, his name was Joe Rulore, and he 
was -- he made a small stuff, like a sidewalk
. I said, ﬁJoe, every body™s a builder, why 
can™t we become builders?ﬂ He never was a 
builder. So I said, ﬁY ou know what, I will 
buy a lot, and you put
 up th e house.ﬂ So I bought a lot to put in the first house 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
85
 
 
 
[indecipherable], and we made out all right. An
d then later he was afraid to buy more, so 
then later I bought land, I su
bdivid ed the land, and I had the construction company, and I 
made all all right, yeah. 

Q: And that™s the profession you stayed in? 

A: Yes, yeah. 
Q: In -- in Poland you had wund -- I na -- 
you rememb er that you said your -- your 
dreams was to become either a -- 
A: A doctor or an actor. 

Q: A doctor or an actor. 
A: Yeah, but here I couldn™t be a doctor, and I 
couldn™t be an actor. An actor maybe I am, 
but in my own way. So now -- so -- so I -- 
I did all right, and -- and I developed, and -- 
and I built, and then  later I took in partners
. Then later, my family was proud of me. I 
made a living, so I remember we had the family
 circle organization, and wh en I started to 
make money, I bought my  wife a mink stol
e. And this time a mink™s -- it was the first 
mink stole in the family. So wh
en we came to a meeting, so
 -- they elected me for the 
president of the si -- family circle. You know,
 they took me, and they
 -- they went with 
me to the front. So  when they
 said, ﬁYou are the president 
from the family circles,ﬂ I took 
off my wife™s mink stole, and I said, ﬁPlease me
et the president of the family circle.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁWhat do you mean?ﬂ So I said, ﬁIf I woul
dn™t be able to buy a mink stole, I would 
never be a president of my family circle.ﬂ Th
ey didn™t like it. Okay. 
So -- so -- so they -- 
then later they started to say -- I started to ma
ke a good living, they said, ﬁWell, he is all 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
86
 
 
 
right. He is all right. We put him on his feet
.ﬂ Nobody did anything, they put me on his 
feet. So -- 
Q: I -- I -- I wanted to ask you one -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- one question. Your life has been 
very mu ch impacted by betrayals.  
A: Yes. 

Q: A lot of betrayals -- 

A: A lot of them. 

Q: -- by very close people, 
by -- by friends of yours. 
A: Yeah, right. 

Q: And in a sense now in America,
 even by family [indecipherable] 
A: Mm, yeah. 
Q: How does one -- and it™s so -- for so many 
years, how did you learn to adju st to 
normal life, and to trust people again? 
A: Well, because I had people who I -- who we
re good to me. I had people wel -- those 

were -- you see like, fo r instance, my wife ha
d an uncle here. She ne
ver knew him, in the 
end she never me - - thi s was a si st er of
 her grandmother. When  we came over, they 
became very cl -- they -- they
 -- they wanted to do anyt
hing for us. And they were 
practically strangers. I remember
 when  I was a peddler, and it 
was before Christmas that I 
used to give out merchandise, and they paid
 me out two dollars a week, three dollars a 
week. I didn™t have money in the beginning.
 So this man came, and he brought me a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
87
 
 
 
blank check, a signed check. He said, ﬁYou ne
ed the money, make it out as mu ch as you 
want.ﬂ I never used the check because it was 
not -- it was blank. I never use it. But he 
gave it to me. I mean, he gave it to me, I ga
ve him back the check. So there were people 
who were very -- strangers, who were very go
od to me, and to my
 wife. But the people 
that I expect them to be good, they were 
not. The same thing in
 Poland. There were 
people, peasants I didn™t know, and they were
 very -- they saved my life. But the people 
who I knew, they were not. Ma
ybe the people who I knew, they thought that they  had, 
because they know me, they have
 a right to do it. And the 
people who didn™t know me 
did it because from the goodness of their heart.
 It was me or someb
ody else, that they 
would do it for everybody. But 
here in America, I was very
, very disappointed . There 
were some who were very ni
ce, who couldn™t do -- like for 
instance, I remember I had 
here a first cousin. She™s still alive. And the 
first cousin, I wanted to see her. I never saw 
her, because she was born in America. I know 
my father got gray on account of her, 
because she was already 32 years and she wa
sn™t married. So here in Europe he was 
worrying -- he always -- my fath
er, he had a habit, if he was 
worrying, he used to bite his 
beard, he had a long beard. So
 you -- so when  he start to bite his beard, so my  mo ther 

said, ﬁWhat are you worried again because Fr
ances is not married?ﬂ She already knew. 
So when I came over here, she was -- she w as 
already married, and I was here about six 
months, once I called her up, and I said to he
r, ﬁFrances, I™m here 
already six months, I 
would like to see you.ﬂ So she said, ﬁYea
h, yeah, come over sometimes.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁSometimes is no good. Today 
is Sunday, I don™t work, how™
s about if I will come over 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
88
 
 
 
today?ﬂ She said, ﬁOh, today is no good, be
cause I invited already so me guests.ﬂ She 
invited guests, which she was afraid to this
 animal should come and introduce me? We 
wanted to  meet people, we wanted to get so
mebody, we wanted to have friends. So she 
said -- when she to
ld me -- she told me as
 I was in the telephone 
booth, because we didn™t 
have a telephone. No, well -- 
she said, ﬁLet™s go -- let™s se
e us sometimes.ﬂ So I said, 
ﬁWhat™s wrong today?ﬂ So she said, ﬁI alrea
dy invited some guests.ﬂ So those were the 

things that they were -- but, lik
e when instance my wife has 
a aunt from her -- the aunt di-
didn™t stay with -- with -- with her husband, 
but the husband was her father™s brother. Bu t 
when  we came, she took us in like the ga -- 
we would be their ch
ildren. But with the 
children, til today we are very close. There is
 a son who was our age,
 he didn™t go out on 
a date if he wouldn™t invite us to go on th
e same date. He took us 
the first time to Radio 
City, to show. And all those -- every place he
 went. There were people, but the people 
that you expected the most. A
nd I have an a -- an answer fo
r what. You see, my family, 
my  father, from the seven sisters and brothe
r, he was the only who remained home. All of 
them came over here in the nine
t -- in the 1880™s. One came 
-- and they were very poor. 
They come from a villa
ge. They never saw -- they never 
were educated. And they told 
their children -- well, they children went 
already to co llege, you know, they were 
[indecipherable] they got professions. They  told
 their children their life, how they lived in 
this village, in the 1880™s. Wh
en we came, they looked at 
us with the same eyes. Why? 
Because they forgot, or they didn™t know 
that America had a progress from 1880 to 1947. 
We had a progress in our house -- in our home. 
Maybe not so fast as here. They couldn™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
89
 
 
 
understand, they ask my wife what she will do
. She said, ﬁWell, I stu d ied medicine home, 
I would like to continue.ﬂ But this was out of 
question. Sh e said, ﬁI can be a teacher. I can 
be a Hebrew teacher.ﬂ They showed us, ﬁYou 
see here hair? Like hair will grow here, so 
can you be a teacher.ﬂ ﬁWhy?ﬂ ﬁTo be a teache
r here you have to go to college.ﬂ She 
said, ﬁI went to college.ﬂ They couldn™t 
understand this. Why? Because they knew the 
stories from their parents, and they looked at
 us like we would come out from this village 
in 1880. And fo r this reason they  had a differe
nt feel. Now, for instance, I told my wife, 
ﬁWe go to  America, and we™ll have a lot of 
friends, because all my  cousins are my  age. 
So we will have something in common.ﬂ They 
never invited us to -- 
to go out with them, 
they never invited us to 
go to a theater together. 
Q: When  you -- wh en you did ma
ke friends, finally, were they mostly other survivors, or 
-- 
A: Yes. Mostly other -- there were some exce
ptions. Mostly other surv ivors, because we 
had a common language, we had a common past, 
and everybody tells a -- mo stly others -- 
even til today. There are some
 exceptions, that they are Am
ericans. Again, the same 
thing. We are strangers, we are outsiders. Ther e are some that -- and some, if we started 

to make good. So some were jealous. I have a 
cousin, so when I had the first ap artment in 
Bensonhurst, I bought beautiful, new furnitur
e, it was under water. And the cousin went 
to college here, and he hardly  had the job. So  
the mother and father came to visit me, so I 
heard -- she said to with th 
-- to the husband. ﬁLook, look, Al
bert went to college. Look, 
he™s a greener, he just came. Look at his be
autiful apartment.ﬂ Inst
ead to be happy th at 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
90
 
 
 
we did it, and nobody ga
ve us a penny, and they -- a lo
t of American people who didn™t 
make it, they look at us, and they  are jealous
. Why? Because we did better than they. Bu t 
we are mostly comfortable with
 survivors. We know their st
ories, they know my stories. 
We know their pain, they -- 
in this. So mostly where 
we have [indecipherable] 
Q: Did you continue at that 
time, even after those first upsetting experiences, to -- to 
speak, to talk about 
your experience, or was it [indecipherable] 
A: No, I always spoke. 
Q: You always -- 

A: I always spoke, I never -- I never stopped, 
even in th e beginning, people didn™t want to 
listen, I alw ays -- I -- see, my wife didn™t
. I always -- some other survivors didn™t. I 
always wrote about it, and I -- I never stopped 
telling. Other people, even today, they say, 
ﬁWell, you know, you are obsessed with th e 
Holo caust.ﬂ I tell you a other thing wh at 
happened  tw o weeks ago. And this is a thing 
that I spoke a week later in Queens, and I 
told the story, they couldn™t believe it. I 
am an -- on th e board  of the B™nai Brith. You 
know the B™nai Brith yeah? So, I am on the 
executive board, and we have meetings once 
a week. So when we had the 
meeting two weeks ago -- so we started to make plans for 
the next year for our meetings
, what will be our meetings, wh
at will be [indecipherable]. 
So one came out, and he said, ﬁWell, last year
 we had a meeting, we
 had the movie. And 
we had a lot of people, and the people apprecia
ted the movie. So  let™s have a movie next 

week t -- next year, too. So  -- so one said, ﬁO kay, we™ll have a movie, I know a nice 
movie by Woody Allen, from 1934, a come
dy.ﬂ Well, I personally don™t like Woody 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
91
 
 
 
Allen, he™s not my  type, and his comedies are 
not -- so there -- they st
arted that. So I said, 
ﬁWell, instead to have a Woody
 Allen comedy, there is a new tape came out, I just -- I 
have it here, about two ladies who saved Je
ws during the war. One is from Poland, and 
one is from France. Beautiful film. It is about
 the Holo caust, but it is not so bloody, it is 
not so depressing. But it™s a b
eautiful -- to see what the two 
ladies did -- they saved. I 
have it here. So let™s have this movie.ﬂ When 
I said this, one man gets up, he said, ﬁYou 
stop with this crap about the 
Holocaust. I had this crap enou
gh. I don™t want to listen to 
this crap.ﬂ First I thought crap, I don™t know if
 it™s with a P, with a B, so I figured maybe 
he doesn™t like to eat crabmeat, 
I don™t know. Later I find out 
it™s with a P. And he started 
on th e crap, and crap, and crap, yeah. In the 
beginning, w -- I looked at him, I couldn™t 
say anything, because I was so -- I couldn™t 
believe it. S o  I said to him, ﬁDo you know 
that the Holo caust, it happened to  me fif,ﬂ 
-- [clock chiming] Okay. I™m waiting for the 
bird.  

Q: Well, maybe we should just wait for the birds -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. [indecipherable] 

Q: -- because I™m sort of at the end of 
the tape again, too. Let™s -- let™s -- 
A: Okay, now. No, no, 
notay. No, le -- I™ll fin ish it. So
 I said, ﬁDo you know, six million 
Jews were killed. It only ha
ppened 50 years ago.
 Survivors are still 
alive. What do we 
demand from people who are not Jews, if th
ere are deniers? 250 books were written by 
non-Jews that the Ho locaust never happened . 
Here, on a Jewish organization, you started 
the story with the crap busine
ss?ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat -- we suffer.ﬂ
 I said, ﬁYou? What did you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
92
 
 
 
suffer? You suffered? You have
 your parents, you have y
our ch ildren, you have your 
grandchildren, they are here. Surely, you su
ffer, because I know you 
couldn™t get enough 
steaks, because steaks you coul
dn™t buy enough, you had to 
eat chicken. Every day you 
had to eat chicken. You couldn™t have enou
gh sugar, it was rationed. You didn™t have 
enough toilet paper, it was rationed, so you suffe
red.ﬂ I said, ﬁI am s
till alive. People are 
still alive. It was 50 years ago, a million and 
a half children. And when I say Holocaust, 
you say this is crap?ﬂ I had a ver -- I almo st 
dropped dead. Now, wh at
 gets me more -- I 
walked out. Now, I will never go to a other 
meeting there. What gets me more is that 
from all -- there were 18 people. From all 
the 18people, nobody 
stood up and said a 
word. Nobody. If it will be another occasion if 
I will be there, I wouldn™t sit quiet. I mix 
in. Nobody said a word. I walk
ed home. A man born in  America, went to college in 
America, and he said, ﬁS
top with this crap. I he
ard this crap enough.ﬂ

wanted to  ask you, have you ev

th at your fami ly was always

ily is also very str -- was ve
ry strongly Zionist. Did you 
ever go? 
A: No. 

Q: And whe -- and when? 

A: No, we didn™t go to Palestine, because
 when we came from Germany, we came to 
America, and in this time, I wanted -- I started 
to work here in -- ther
e are -- there were -- 

when I came to America 
in 1947, I started to 
work  in our organization, it was the -- not 
the Hagannah, it started -- it worked in the or
ganization, it was more to the right. It was 
the ha -- the -- it™s like from the 
hirute, mo re with Begin™s organization. And I wanted to  
go to fight, because this was my dream, 
to go to fight, I told you earlier. 
Q: Actually, I meant as a visit, because 
I understand that your [indecipherable] 
A: Well -- well, we come -- 
Q: But did you ever visit? 
A: -- so I -- f -- 31 times [indecipherable]. So 
-- so I wanted to go to 
fight. Then I got in 
contact -- they contact me. There was a Major 
Wiser, he was a majo r of the English army, 
and he was actually from South America, but 
he was in the English army . He came over 
here, he organized a group, and he called 
it the George Washington Legion. And he

wanted to  have a group here to be equipped 
in America, like there was once a Irish army 
that they went there. And he wa
nted to go with this group to 
Palestine, in this time before 
Israel was a state, in to fight. And I was invo
lved with this group, an d we had me -- had 
meetings every single week, and he, becaus
e on my  background from Poland, I became 
the head of the military  police 
in this group, because we ha
d to have a military  police. 
Well, anyway, we had to go, and we had quite 
a bit volunteers, and we also had, between 
-- we had mostly Jews, vetera
ns, but y -- we also had a few Black who jo ined  us, who 
went -- came up in the ran -- but we also had 
a few Irish . Now, the Irish veterans, they 
said they didn™t care where they
 go to fight, so long it™s ag
ainst England. And this was 
against England. So  it was funny. So we -- we
 organized it, and we had to be equipped, 
and then later the American government didn™
t allow it. They said 
we will not allow the 
equipped army  to go, and it fell apart, so I st
arted to wo rk in the other organizations, and 
to go to Israel. And I was rea
dy to go to Palestine in this 
time, and we send out in this 
time, people individual to ru -- 
to go to Marseille, and from Ma
rseille, they dropped us to 
Palestine to fight. And one, it was on a Frid
ay I remember, and it came -- my wife knew 
that I belonged there, but 
she didn™t know ex actly what
. Friday I came, and I said, 
ﬁSunday morning, I am going. It™s my turn to  go,ﬂ which I was very happy. So she was 
not angry, she said, ﬁWell, it™s your choice if
 you want to go. Bu t one thing you should 
know, if you go, you have no way to come 
back. I will not wait for you, because I lost 
enough people my  family, and I don™t want to 
have somebody else to
 lose. And I know if 
you will go, you will be killed, or you will be
 wounded, and I don™t want -- so, it™s your -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
95
 
 
 
your choice to go.ﬂ Well, we had the whole 
day to think about it. Sunday mo rning th e 
group left, and I didn™t go. And I was -- now
, if people will ask me -- if people will ask 
me what is my biggest regret in
 life, there are a lot of things
 that I regret, but my biggest 
regret in life is that I didn™t 
go to Palestine to fight. If I surv
ived the war, and I didn™t go 
to Palestine, this makes me somebody -- I don™t 
want to say a traitor, but some -- this is 
my biggest regret. Because if somebody w
ill tell me that I will have a choice, and a 
chance to be in Palest
ine for one day -- I thi
nk I told you this yesterday, if I will be -- 
have a choice to be in Palestine to fight for pa -- for a Jewish state one day, and the next 
day to be killed, I will always 
say that this would be my c
hoice. Because if I could do it 
for Poland, which I was not a fi
rst class citizen, I should have
 done it for Palestine, and I 
didn™t go. In 1939 -- in 1949, after we star
ted to make a few dollars, my wife was a 

Hebrew teacher, and this time they send over 
a group of Hebrew teachers for courses to 
Jerusalem,  which she didn™t need it, but she 
went anyway. This was the first p lane that 
went with visitors to Palestine. So we went, 
and we went to stay th
ere. We went to settle 
there. The family [indecipherable] had a family
, and they said, ﬁYou are in America, and 

Israel is very bad now.ﬂ Peopl
e didn™t have wo rk, didn™t have
 what to eat. ﬁSo, if you 
come over, you -- you missed your chance, b
ecause there is no work. During the war we 
could use you. Now, 
you missed your chan ce, there is
 n o  war, so you better go to 
America, make money, send us 
the money.ﬂ So  we didn™t stay there, but, I have to tell 
you one -- this was the first trip, we were in
 1949. Since then, my wife and I, we were 
there 31 times, but I was mo re than 31 times, 
but I™m say -- staying for the 31 times. The 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
96
 
 
 
-- th-the time in 20 -- in 1949
, when I was a -- I met then 
a young fellow, his name i s 
Lonna Guerrera. And he was in 
my unit, he was a captain in my unit, and then later he 
went to Palestine, and he was -- he fought
 there in the war. When
 am -- I met him in 
Jerusalem, he was a major, and he was very glad
 to see me, so he said, ﬁI have to show 
you something.ﬂ And he took me to a plac
e in Jerusalem, you know, in this time 
Jerusalem was divided, and he took me to a 
place where there was a wall, and in the wall 
you could see new cinder blocks put in in  a hole 
-- in the -- replaced. So he told me that -- 
that his group, they  wanted to break thro ugh
, and to go and to  liberate the old part of 
Jerusalem, but they were not 
enough, and more than half we
re killed, and the rest came 
back, and he was one who was sa
ved, and he showed  me this. 
When he showed me this, I 
started to cry. And he ask me, ﬁWhat are 
you crying?ﬂ He said, 
ﬁDo you know why you 
didn™t take it in this time? Because I wasn™t
 here. Because I wasn™t here, and for this 
reason [indecipherable].ﬂ So he said, ﬁWhat do
 you mean? We were about 80 people, and 
what would me -- make a difference if you woul
d be here? You probab
ly  would be killed, 
too.ﬂ Cause I always was the fi
rst one. I said, ﬁNo, it™s not onl
y me. Because if I would be 
here, and thousands like me, or two thousan ds 
like me, we would be able to take it. I 
wasn™t here, 2,000 like me who survived were
 not here, and fo r this reason you couldn™t 
take it.ﬂ So I will never forget this -- this 
minute, when he showed
 me this. And I felt 
very -- I had very -- a big regret. Even America 
is very good for me, I have everything in 
America, th ere is not a thing that I cannot ha
ve. But this was my pl
ace. If I survived the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
97
 
 
 
war, from the whole family, and if I -- in Isr
ael, had a war of independence, and I wasn™t 
there, this was wrong.  
Q: Did you feel Jewish  in a different way in 
Israel than in Americ
a? Your identity as a 
Jewish person? 
A: No, I didn™t feel Jewish -- you see, you -- 
the different how you fe
el Jewish. Now, you 
see, I was v ery religious home. I am not relig
ious now. I am not religious, I don™t know 
how far I believe, or disbelieve, I don™t want 
to think about it, but I am not religious, 
why? Because, when I needed 
God, He wasn™t there. Now, 
you ask a questi
on why. See, I 
didn™t make peace yet with God. When my n-
nieces needed God, He
 wasn™t there. But 
being a Jew, to me, is something else. Being 
a Jew -- I am proud of being a Jew, because 
we surviv ed 4,000 years. People who were st
ronger than the Jews, more than the Jews, 
they vanished. Who were on their own gro
und, on the [indecipher
able] place, they 
vanished. Jews were not on their places, th
ey somehow su rvived. Jews were sa -- were 
tortured and killed for so ma
ny places, started with the Crus
aders, with the Inquisition, 
with the Chminiski, with the 
pogroms, with all those things
, finally with the Holocaust, 
they survived. So for 
me, being a Jew is something else; 
that we survived
. And also, what 
we gave the world. We gave the world so
 mu ch, mo re than any other people. The 
Germans gave the world a lot of things. They 
get artists, and players,
 and this and th at. 
But they gave also a lot of misery. We Jews
 didn™t give misery, we
 Jews contributed , and 
even til today, ta -- in every field, doctors, 
scientists, everything you -- singers, actors, 

Jews contribute, starting with the anci
ent times. The Jews contribute the 10 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
98
 
 
 
commandments. No other people contribute
d the 10 commandments. Now, if the God -- 
let™s say you belo -- you believe
 in God. If God wanted to choose a family, and to bring 
like the Catholics say, to bring 
the son for the world, who did He
 pick out? He didn™t pick 
out the Mexican family. He didn™t pick out 
the Irish family, or a German family. He 
picked out a Jewish fa
mily, who were very religious. And 
they He picked 
out, and there 
was created a Jesus. I don™t believe in it. I 
believe Jesus was a great man, but he was a 
man, that™s all. He never dreamt about be
ing a God. Because if you will tell Jesus when  
he was alive that he would be a God, he 
would probably commit suicide, cause he was a 
very good Jew. But God, let™s say I™m n-now 
saying from the sight of the non-Jews, if he 
create -- he w -- he picked out 
-- he picked out a Jew. Why? So  the Jews gave the world a 
God. 2,000 years later, look, a 
billion people believed in him. 
Did they get a thanks for it? 
No. They didn™t get a thanks, we
ll you gave us a God. They 
killed the Jews for the God. 
Now, they say that Jews are Christ killers. 
Now, this is not true. I was interviewed two 
years ago, and there was a question about the 
Holocaust, then wha 
-- was a t-time that 
people ask questions, and one ma
n asked the question, he said, ﬁIsn ™t there -- isn™t this a 
time to forget and forgive?ﬂ So
 the man -- the moderator said 
he™s going to answ er it, I 
said no, this -- I answer this
. So when I ask this man, I 
said, ﬁTell me, what nationality 
are you?ﬂ He said, ﬁPolish.ﬂ ﬁWhat is your profe
ssion?ﬂ He said, ﬁA priest.ﬂ So I said to 
him, ﬁYou asked, isn™t it time to forget an
d fo rgiv e?ﬂ I said, ﬁThis happened 50 years 
ago.ﬂ I said to him, ﬁDo you know there wa
s a nice Jewish young man 2,000 years ago, 
and he was killed, not by the Jews, he was k
illed. Did you forgot an
d forgive 2,000 years 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
99
 
 
 
later? Here, a million and a half childrens were
 killed, and you ask to
 forget and forgive?ﬂ 
He hung up, he didn™t answe
r. So, this what gives me, th e 
Jews, in every respect, in 
everything, they contributed . They contributed
 in Germany. You had famous writers in 
Germany. Later, they were forbidden. You 
have famous composers in Germany. You 
have famo us composers in Vienna. You have 
famous psychiatrists in Vienna, the first 
casa -- psychi -- Freud was in Vienna, and so 
on. Did the Jews get a thanks for it? No. 
What™s wrong with Mendelsohn
, what is wr-wrong with Le
ssing? What is -- one -- and 
now we start to -- to -- to -- to give all thos
e a -- so this is -- and also, they were always 
held back , they never had a place to go 
ahead. Thank God in 
America they don™t -- 
nobody holds them back. But th
ey  doing all the generations, they  always were held back . 
But still somebody said, ﬁJews are like quick
silver.ﬂ You know what quicksilver is? 
Q: Yes. 

A: When  you try to press it down, it always 
runs away , it always -- the quick silver run. 
So the other said no. Jews is 
like a bamb oo stick. Take a ba
mb oo stick, you bend it down , 
it straightens out, always. And this how Jews ar
e. For this reason I am proud to be a Jew. 
My heritage gave to the world a lot. We™re 
not appreciated for it. We are capable. We 
come to a country, maybe we
 establish ourself better than
 others. Maybe we are better 
businessmen, maybe we think a little more. We
ll, there is a -- a -- a joke, and I don™t 
know if you will like this joke. 

Q: Well, tell it anyway. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052

A: There wa -- there was an auction, and th
ey sold brains from different nationality, you 
know the story? 
Q: No. 
A: No. So they sold a brain 
-- there was a brain for fives do
llars, a brain for 10, and there 
was -- to transplant brains. A brain for 50 
dollars, a brain for a hundred dollars, and a 
brain for thousand dollars. They to ok a Ru ssi
an brain, the Russian brain was -- no, the 

Polish brain, the Po lish brain was the cheapest
, five dollars. Then 
they took a Russian 
brain, was 20 dollars. Then  th
ey  took a English brain, 50 dollars. A German brain, 
hundred dollars, a Jewish brain,
 thousand dollars. No, I said
 the story wrong. I said the 
story wrong. It was -- 

Q: Okay, let™s -- let™s d o  again. 

A: It was the opposite, it was the opposite. Th
e -- the -- the -- the Polish brain was -- was 
thousand dollars, the -- the -- 
the what™s I sai d ? Russians --  
Q: Russians. 

A: -- was hundred dollars. The German was --
 the Jewish brain was the cheapest, five 
dollars. They ask, why is the Jewish brain th
e cheapest? He said, because this is a used 
brain, so this is the cheapes
t. The Polish brain was not used
, so you had to pay thousand 
dollars for it. Now, I don™t think so  this -- 
so, I -- I don™t know why I made the mistake, 
but it -- 
Q: Well, I would like to as
k you fo r another joke -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
101
 
 
 
Q: But let me -- let me go 
back just [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, but this is -- but this is -- but 
this is -- this is w h at I think, yeah. 
Q: Let me ask you just one 
mo re question about Palestine.
 H-How did you feel that 
survivors were perceived there? Was it diffe
rent, the image that -- or the way people 
responded to you as a survivor th
an in America, or was it -- 
A: No, because there were -- th
e majority of -- don™t forget
, when Israel -- when the 
Palestine was -- before Palestine there was 
400,000 Jews, 450,000 Je
ws, and then later, 
when the people start to come
 in, come in, come in, ther
e are four million Jews. So 
majority, people who survived went to Pale
stine, later to Israel. And there are the 
children of the survivor
s, so there are the majority of 
the people who su
rvived. So you 
didn™t have the feeling that you are an outside
r. And also, when I came
 to Israel -- when I 
already came to Israel, I came home. This wa
s my home. When I came over here, and tha 
-- and we had an organization, and I gave a re
port, how I experienced, how I liked Israel 
in this time. So I remember I 
told them, I said -- th
ey -- they say -- I had a brother in is -- 
in Israel. Did you have a lot of friends, and how
 did they peer -- so I 
said, when I came to 
Israel, I had friends all over, all over ma -- I we
nt over to the massada, I had a friends, the 
people who committed  suicide, th
e massad -- I lived with them . I -- when I went over to 
Teberius, I had friends. In Teberius, there is the rumbum. There i -- there is old sages that 
I lived with them, I was brough
t up rabmaya bel harnis, I don™t know if you know th ere is 
a man that they called him the miracle man, he
 is buried in Teberius. I said, ﬁI came to 
them, and those were my  friends, because I 
was brought up with them.ﬂ I was started 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
102
 
 
 
since I was three years about th
em. So you see, all those peopl
e were with me. I went to 
Marron, I saw the people who created the caballah, the mystic. Those were my friends. 
So I came home to Israel, because they were 
there. It™s the same 
thing like naturally, a 
Christian goes to Israel, and he
 walk, and he said, ﬁI am walk
ing the same ro
ad that Jesus 
walked.ﬂ I went, and I walked the same day with
 -- the same road with
 Jesus, but not with 
the Jesus who mi -- was made a G od hundred fift
y years after his death. I walk with Jesus 
when  he was a Jewish boy, a very religious 
Jewish boy. So I knew all those things. I 
walked with Mary, with
 the mother, that she was a Jewish
 mother, who lived in Nazareth. 
So for me, Israel was home. I came home, be
cause I knew the people. The people, I knew  
them for thousands of years.  

Q: But then you could not stay -- 

A: No. 
Q: -- because you were advised to -- 
A: No, I -- not that I couldn™t stay, because 
my family told me, an d this time was that 
center -- I don™t know if you know, there was 
a question with food, a question with war, 
and the same. If I would bring over money in 
this time, I didn™t have money. I didn™t 
have a profession. If I would be a docto r, a 
carpenter, or anything. I -- I was here, I 
started to be a peddler. I couldn™t be a peddle
r iwa -- in -- in Israel. I didn™t have one 
Jewish customer in America being a peddle
r. If I -- I couldn™t make a living from a Jew, 
because he was smarter than I 
was. So I had Polish customers.
 So what will I do in j -- in 
a -- what will I do in Israel? Well, somebody wholisten to this tape, they will laugh a lot. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
103
 
 
 
So -- so -- so what would I do in Israel? I ha
d there a family. My wife had three uncles, 
but they  couldn™t do anything 
for me. So for this reason they
 said, ﬁGo back, you are a,ﬂ -
- they said, ﬁwe needed you two years ago, 
we needed you to figh
t.ﬂ Which I would be 
happy. ﬁNow, we will have two more mouths 
to feed. We don™t ha
ve the food. Go to 
America, make money.ﬂ And this what I did.
 We went to America, my sister-in-law 
needed  help , somebody 
else needed help, we were alwa
ys there to help. Charity we 
needed -- needed help. So
 this is a difference of but toos 
-- to live. See, we -- I came -- I 
missed the boat with Israel. 

Q: Yeah. [inaudible] 
A: Well [indecipherable] 
Q: In -- in the -- in the 1950
™s, the Cold War, during that pe
riod, did you agree with the 
sentiments there, with the st
rong feel of -- of Communism
, and everything, or did you 
have -- 

A: No, I didn™t -- I didn™t feel commits -- you 
see, I lived under Communism. You see, in 
Communism, it depends on wh ich side of the fe
nce you are. I was on th e right side of the 
fence. Not that I was a Communi
st. I never belonged to  the Co mmunist party. As a matter 
of fact, when I had a big position, the people who were above me always came, and they 

gave out ankettas, to write down to beco me 
a memb er of the Communist party. And they  
always gave me anketta, and each time the an
ketta had 25 questions more, always they 
add mo re. And every time I g -- 
I -- I reg -- received a -- you 
know the anketta is. When I 
received the anketta, and they said to fill 
it out to become a Communist party member. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
104
 
 
 
The reas -- the answer I s -- gave, I said, ﬁI 
am not grown enough to be worthy to be a 
memb er o f th e Co mmun ist p arty .ﬂ T h is was my  
a-answer, and this what
 they liked. I said, 
ﬁI have to learn a little more about the Communist
 party, I want to give an answer.ﬂ But I 
never believed, because to me, you see, I co
me from a very Orth od
ox family. I come 
from a rich family. Now, those two items we
re alien to Communism. And this was I had 
from my  home. I give you another example 
-- you see, I always give you examples. 
When  I was in Poland, I had dealings with  Sa
ppearha. Sappearha was the head of the co -

- of the Catholic church. He was the cardinal.
 As a matter of fact, the pope who is now 
pope, he was a prodigy of Sappearha. So I 
had some dealings with Sappearha. I looked 
on Sappearha, he was the head 
of the Catholic church, I lo oked  with him, and I feel 
terrible. Why? The Communism regime -- Comm
unist regime was against him. What did 
he want? He wanted to have his religion.
 W h en  I lo ok ed  o n  S a
ppearha, I didn™t see 
Sappearha there, pol -- the Catholic cardinal
. I saw my rabbi by wh
ich I studied. With -- 
til 17 years I studied in the Yeshiva, you kn
ow what a Yeshiva is? I saw my rabbi, the 
very Orthodox Hassidic Jew. I didn™t see 
Sappearha, I saw my  rabbi. Why? Because 
would he be alive in 1945, he 
would be treated the same  as 
Sappearha is treated, because 
he will be -- he will represent a religion wh
at the Communism was against, the same 
thing as the Catholic religion.
 So I saw my rabbi sitting th
ere instead Sappearha. So for 
this reason, my feelings, when it came to 
Communism, was different, that mostly young 
people who embraced -- I never -- and also, my 
wife was always against this belief, why? 
Because she comes fro m a home, and if -- her 
home suffered very much
. Her father lost 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
105
 
 
 
his job, they  threw her out in th e apartmen
t, why? Because they 
were considered the 
bourgeoisie. They were afraid they will send 
them to Siberia. So you see, the difference 
is, from where -- would I come from a very, very
 poor home, that we suffered, or from a 
home that we never believed in religion,
 I would embrace Comm
unism, because this 
would be my dream. I came from a different worl
d. So even in this
 time, this w as the 
regime, but my  aim in this regime was one 
-- my  purpose was only one thing, to take 
revenge. This was the only thing th at I was ha
ppy with . But I wasn™t 
happy with -- with -- 
with all the other doctrines from --  from this regime. You understand? 
Q: Yeah. So your feelings we
re quite -- more complicated 
then, when McCarthy started 
really -- 

A: Well, no, McCarthy, what I thought of him, I 
felt that this is a betrayal of America, he 
-- because the people were not 
guilty, and I think he was a tr
aitor. And to me, if you will 
ask me if I like mctar -- McCarthy more or 
less than Goebbels, I will say the same way. 
The same, because would McCarthy be on Goeb
bels place, he wouldn™t be better than 
Goebbels. I™m not talking about Hitler, becau
se he was -- nobody is above him, but 

Goebbels, I -- I would sing -- I would say th
at McCarthy and Goeb be
ls were the same, 
because he was a man that he accused innocent
 people. I was very, ve
ry, very much hurt 
in this time.  

Q: Were you ever contacted, 
since you had a position in the 
Polish Intelligence, were you 
ever contacted in America, here, 
by officials, about [indecipherable] 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
106
 
 
 
A: No, no, I -- no, no, I was 
only contacted when  I escaped 
to Germany. Wh en I escaped 
-- I worked for a cert time for the CIC, you kn
ow, they had the CIC in
 this time, not the 
CIA. And the CIC was a milita
ry Intelligence. The reason wh
y I -- I could be of help, 
because I could find out from cam
ps, when people were ga -- 
got their visas to come to 
America, to  find out from Poland, not from 
Jews, from pole -- because I masqueraded as 
-- well, then I didn™t masquerade, but I co
uld, to find out who was a collaborator, and 
who was not worthy to enter America. So th
is I worked, I had a man from the CIC, that 
he gave me directions, and I wo rked there.  
Q: Yeah, we are nearing the end of the tape
 again, but let me ask you one personal 
question. All this is personal, of course, but -- 

A: Well [indecipherable] 

Q: -- different question, wh en was your 
daughter born? Do you [indecipherable] 
A: My daughter was born el -- 11 years afte
r my marriag e. 11 year -- my daughter was 
born in 1956. In the beginning we
 didn™t want to have ch ildren. Bu t of course, we spoke, 
and we said no, we don™t want 
to bring children to such a 
cruel world, because this was 
[indecipherable]. But later we figured, well, w
ithout children -- we wa
nted to defeat, to 
be a victor over Hitler. Now, when we survived , so we were the victors. Even he killed 

six million Jews, but I am alive. B u t then late
r, we decided, if we will not have children, 
Hitler will win the war. So this way, we w
ill have children, like we have now three 
grandchildren. This means that
 we succeeded, and we defeated
 Hitler. So this was when 
we wanted  to have th em, it took 
11 years til we got our daughter.

Q: Do you f -- h-how was your 
-- your parenting? Do  you thin
k that was affected by your 
experience before, or -- and let me combine 
this with another qu
estion, what kind of 
values did you want to
 hand to your child? 
A: Well, our -- well, w e wanted to have th
e highest values. My parenting was -- we did 
something very wrong, because 
we started to talk about the 
Holocaust too early. And this 
pushed away  my  daughter, because we didn™t 
have to start to speak about the Holocaust 
when she was three, four years old. Now, sh
e always said, ﬁLook, all my  friends have 
grandfathers, I don™t have grandfathers. All my  friends has aunts,ﬂ she doesn ™t have. Bu t 

we started to tell her stories about the Holoca
ust, and this was very bad, because we -- 
this was true, we -- we pushed her away from it.
 And the same thing w
ith her grandchild -
- with her children, when we st
arted to tell stories about the 
Holo caust, my  daughter says 
not to tell her, they are too 
young. They  cannot understand,
 and we shouldn™t always -- 
now today, when  I speak in schools, and I sp
eak sometimes to first and second grade. As 
a matter of fact, not long ago, I spoke of 
it to a kinderg arten. Now, I don™t tell them 
cruelties. I tell them th ere 
were bad people, and there 
were good people. Now, for 
instance, the children -- I collected six m
illion pennies, it was on television, and I tell 
them -- and they collected pe
nnies for -- for this Jewish Foundation for the Righteous. 
We send money to non-Jews w
ho help Jews. So I tell them 
we have to collect pennies, 
because there were bad people, who wanted  to kill children. T
hose people saved the 
children. So I said, ﬁImagine 
if somebody would try to kill 
you, and there came some -- 
came a ma n, and they saved you. We have to
 reme mb er that there were good people.ﬂ

But I don™t tell them stories, cruel stories.
 When chi -- when child
ren are 14 - 15 - 16, 
then I start to tell them
. But long ago I spoke in a Catholic church -- 
Q: Before we get in to that stor
y, we should chan
ge the cassette. 
A: Okay . 
Q: This is the end of tape -- 
A: Na -- we have a half hour. 
Q: This is the end of tape four, side
 A,  interview with Norman Salsitz. 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Norman Salsitz. This is ta
pe number four, side B.  

A: Now -- 
Q: Yeah, we talked about -- 
A: I -- I start to say, I was invited to a Ca
tholic, Polish church , and the Polish church , it 
was in Hackensack. And this name of the Po
lish is Koschumat Kobosscachins Tahoffsky. 
It means th e church of the mother -- Black 
Madonna of Chancetaho
ff. So when I came in, 
and the mother superior, they were Polish, an
d I thanked her, and I said I™m glad to be -- 
in Polish, I said, ﬁKoschulen mas -- matka
bosska chanstahofsky.ﬂ She said to me, ﬁYou 
know, since the church  is a church, nobody sa id it correct, you are the first one who said 
it correct.ﬂ So then  I asked her, ﬁWhat should I 
tell the people, should 
I tell them stories, 
the real stories, or should I make it a littl e nicer?ﬂ She said, ﬁNo, tell them how it was.ﬂ

Because I spoke -- I speak abou t Polish people worse than I 
speak about Germans, and I 
will tell you the reason why. So
 when  I spoke, and I told 
them stories about the Polish 
people, so I thought, that™s 
it, she will never invite me. Ab
out a month later, she calls me 
up, she said, ﬁYou know, we have a sister c
hurch in Jersey City. Would you come out 
there to speak?ﬂ So I th ought it™s not so bad.
 So -- now, th e reason why I tell you what I s 
-- speak about Po lish people 
more -- more against Polish 
people than the Germans. 
Nobody did so mu ch harm as 
the Germans, because after all,
 they created the Holocaust, 
they did all the killings, they 
had all the ideas about extermin
ation, about all those things. 
The Polish people collaborated 
in a different way. Now, wh
en a German went into the 
SS, or to Einsatzgruppen, or became a Gesta
po man, or killed just for pleasure, he was 
raised with the idea since he 
was in Hitler yugen, and he 
knew that Jew was worse than 
garbage, worse than a 
cockroach, that the Jew 
had to be eliminated. He was prepared for 
it. Even his parents sometimes 
didn™t teach him, which the parents later taught him, too. 
But he was taught in school. The Po lish stude
nt was not taught to kill the Jews. The 
government didn™t give out directives to kill 
the Jews. It came from within. When it came 
to a Jew, they knew they had 
to hate them. S o , for this reas
on, I have mo re -- not blame, I 
feel worse when I speak about Polish anti-
Semitism as hit -- as Germans. Because 
nothing is worse than the Germans, because 
they did that, the wo
rst thing, but each 
individual in Po land -- why did the Polish pe
ople have to collabor
ate with the Germans 
where he was under German occupation. The 
Germans killed see -- three millio n Poles. 
The Poles were se -- g arbage, s
econd class citizen, undesirable,
 so - - so instead to have

two people -- somebody said to me, your enemy™
s enemy is my best friend. Some -- if the 
-- i-if the -- if the Germans were Poles en
emies, they should have -- have comp assion 
with the Jews, who had the same problem, but
 they didn™t. So for 
this reason I feel -- 
there were Poles who helped, 
very few, small percentage. People ask me -- I g o  and 
speak, they ask me, w h at percentage of Pole
s would kill a Jew -- I™m not talking ab out 
Germans, I™m talking about Poles, what pe
rcentage of Poles wo
uld kill a Jew, what 
percentage wouldn™t kill, but
 wouldn™t help, and what per
centage would help? And I was 
thinking about it a long time. I came to the 
conclusion 75 percent of
 the Poles would kill 
a Jew for no reason at all; giving out to the Ge
rmans, or kill them 
themselves. And don™t 
forget, if a Pole gave out a Jew during the wa
r, he got a kilo of sugar, or he -- he got a 
quart of kerosene. If he gave out five Jews, 
he got five kilo  of sugar, imagine what a 
sweet life h e had. 75 percent. 40 percent -- not 40 percent, 20 -- I said 23 percent -- 75 
percent would give out, 23 percent wouldn™t 
give out, they wouldn™t help. They would 
say go aw ay, I don™t want to be involved, but 
they didn™t give them out. We have nothing 
against those people; they didn™t
 help us, but they didn™t kill 
us. See, the pope was within 
the 23 percent. See, I know 
the pope very well. I was w
ith the pope together eight 
months. It™s a different story. We were very
, very good friends. He
 called me Taddek, I 
called him Lolek, cause Karol is the nickname 
Lolek. And I used to meet him two times a 
week, and it™s a different story, well. He, til t
oday, he doesn™t know that I am Jewish. He 

still knows that I am a Pole, but this a story besides this. So 24 -- 
23 percent wouldn™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
111
 
 
 
give out: like the pope, he™s not a murderer, 
but he didn™t help. Two percent help ed Jews. 
So I read Ringenblume -- you know who Ringenblume -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: Right. He wrote, and he wrote about th
e same question, and he came out with the 
same answ er. He came out that 75 percent Pole
s will give out a Jew, or kill a Jew, but he 
said 24 percent wouldn™t help, and wouldn
™t give out. On ly one percent helped. 
Q: How did you figure that, though? 

A: Well, so let me answer you. One percent 
will give out -- will help. So I said, who is 
smarter, I o r Ringenblume? Naturally Ringenbl
ume. A historian, a well known historian, 
and who am I? I am from
 a small town in Kolbushova. So 
I took my town as an example. 
We were 2,000 Jews, 2,000 Po les. If I would 
be right, that two percent Poles saved Jews, 
so it means my  town speople had to save 40
 Jews. Two percent from 2,000, right? They 
didn™t save 40 Jews. Now, Ringenblume will be
 right, one percent. 
So it means my town 
had to save 20 Jews. Did they save 20 Jews? 
No. Did they  save 10 Jews? No, not even a 
half a percent. But to give them -- to -- 
to how you say benefit of the doubt, I say 
Ringenblume was right, one percent saved Jews
. So this is why I say from where I came 
to this conclusion. I came with my town, a
nd every town was the sa
me. In a -- now, you 
will ask -- you asked me this be
fore, before it™s finished I wa
nt to -- to -- now I will tell 
you why I want to do it, and I™
ll do it fast. M y  mother, as a hobby, used to make sweaters, 
for as -- sh e liked it. When there was not too 
much wool left, she made it very fast. And 
they ask her, why you rushing? 
She said, ﬁI want to finish the sweater before I™m out of 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
112
 
 
 
wool.ﬂ So the same thing, I want to finish
 it before we are out of time, we out of 
[indecipherable]. You ask me before about --I told you that I sing a song, when I was 
interviewed -- when I was a mode
rator for this history. And 
th e person, Ray Farr, ask me, 
ﬁWhy is there anti-Semitism in 
Poland so strong, st
ronger than the other countries?ﬂ So I 
said, ﬁI wouldn™t answer you, but I will si
ng you a song, what I 
learned in school, a 

Catholic song, a church  song.ﬂ I re -- I reme mb
er this song, and the song has 12 stanzas. I 
wouldn™t sing you -- for her I sing all the 12, fo
r you I will only sing one. It™s a beautiful 
song, a beautiful melody, I learned it in school
. And this song is th
at Jesus talks to his 
people, to the Jews. And the song is -- [sings
] Lo do may lo do. Sool zamchi woochi nue, 

chemyap secrotchill, Eacham zaveenue, yach
em visbolue zmotza farra oana, atish 
sheshoenju, shish namare ramyoana. And th is 
is the song. People, my people, wh at did I 
do to  you? With wh at did I trangress -- tr
ansgress against you? I 
took you out from the 
bondage of p -- pharaoh, from Egypt. And wh
at did you do to me? You put me on a 
cross. The second is people, my  people, wh at 
did I do to you? I br
ought you in in  a land 
with milk and honey. What did you do to 
me? You crucified me. Th
e third one: people 
my  people, what did I do to  you? I elevated you among all other nations, and you 

elevated me on a cross. And so on and so on. 
Now, wh en we learned this song in  school, 
and if a Polish boy learned this
 song, and he goes out, and he
 see a Jew with a beard, he 
goes to him, and he pulls his 
beard, kicks him, beats him, 
beats him, why? Cause they 
taught him -- what did they tell him? The Jews 
killed Jesus, which is 
not true. And this is 
what I told her, from there is
 the anti-Semitism. And I tell you a other story. Catholics -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052

this is a story about the Puerto Rican. I ha
d a house in Ho boken, and there were Puerto 
Ricans living there. The -- the janitor was a Pu
erto Rican. And once I came in, he had a 
boy about 10 years. He wa -- started to sp
eak. So he ask me, ﬁHey, Mr. Norman, you 
Polacko, you Polacko?ﬂ Because 
they called me Polacko. I sa
id, ﬁN o, I™m not a Polacko, 
I™m a Hoodeo.ﬂ I™m a Jew. So the boy as
ked the father, and I understood what I 
understand, ﬁWhat is a Jew?ﬂ And the father 
gives him a whole less
on. And I could hear 
he gives him a lesson, Jesus, and Jesus, and 
Jesus, and Jesus. He told him a story about 
Jesus. And after he fini shed th
e stories -- the story, the boy goes and pulls my  sleeve, and 
he says, ﬁHey, Mr. Norman, why did you kill Je
sus?ﬂ Because the father told him a story. 
So he asked me why did I kill -- why I killed 
Jesus. So those are the stories ab out anti-
Semitism. When I was a peddle
r, I came in, and always my 
customers lived on the fifth 
floor, they  never lived on th e second -- on th e first floor, because I had to go up, no 
elevator. So I ask him why somebody should
 live on th e first floor. And I dragged my  
suitcases o n  the fifth floor. So I come in 
once, and the door was open, there was a young 
woman, she was born in America, she mu st be
 about 26 years. And the door was open, 
and I hear that she yells -- the child was cr
ying, and she yells to the child, ﬁBe quiet, 
because the Jew will come with
 the sack, and he will take you away.ﬂ This happened in 
Jersey City. And then she tu
rns around, she sees me. She 
was a little embarrassed. I asked 
her, ﬁTell me, why did you tell the stig -- th-the girl that the Jew w
ill come with the sack 
and take you away? Did you ever see a Jew 
comes with a sack a
nd takes away a child?ﬂ 
She says, ﬁWhy, I don™t know, 
but my mother always used 
to tell it to me, and I was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
114
 
 
 
always so afraid I stopped crying.ﬂ The mo ther 
told it to her, she tell
ed it to the child, and 
the child will probably tell it 
to her child. And this is from where the hate, the anti-
Semitism comes. Cause child
ren are not born bad. 
Q: Did you feel that th ere was a ch -- a change
 at a particular time, with regard to more 
acceptance of -- of ethnicity? 
A: Where, in Poland? 
Q: No, here, in -- in America [indecipherable] 

A: Yes, yes, I -- I -- 

Q: And -- and also -- all that -- there was more of a change with regard to wanting to 
know more about the 
Holo caust, or being mo re inte
rested in learning about it? 
A: Now some people in schools pu -- especially
 in New Jersey, because this is a law in 
New Jersey that™s pe -- they have to lear n about the Holocaust. So the children learn. 

Indell and I go out and speak, and they have it 
a -- but in general, I don™t think so . In 
general, I think that the people say -- well, 
what do I have to go 
to strangers, when you 
have a man on my  board meeting for B™nai Brith
, and he started to yell, ﬁStop with this 
crap about the Holocaust. Stop, 
don™t bother me w
ith this Holocaust.ﬂ He™s a Jew. His 
parents came from E u rope, they were saved Hi
s children are, and his grandchildren -- I 
said, I don™t think so. I think maybe -- maybe, 
if somebody has a inte
rest, there are mo re 
books. But also they 
-- they -- you know that in the 
Ho locaust mu seum last year, 80 
percent of visitors were non-Jews. Becaus
e the Jew probably figures, well, I know it 
already. The -- the young people, I know it 
already. Fo r the non-Jews, it™s a novelty. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
115
 
 
 
They want to go in to see 
it. But the Jew  knows it alread
y. So every time I think it will 
get weaker, and weaker. We are farther, farthe
r away. Take for instance the Inquisition. 
You know th e story about the In quisition., 
huh? How many people
 speak about the 
Inquisition? And the Inquisiti
on was a terrib le thing. How 
many people speak about the 
Crusaders? Do you know that 
in Crusaders, 400 Jewish to wn s were destroyed? 400. And 
this time in Poland, in
 Poland were 400,000 Jews. During
 the time of the Crusaders, from 
the 400,000, 200,000 Jews were killed. No
body knows. 50 percent.
 Nobody knows about 
it.  
Q: D-Do you think though that sort 
of movies, like the cam -- the NBC movie 
ﬁHolocaust,ﬂ that came out in ™78, and other 
films are sh aping a cert
ain understanding, or 

[indecipherable] 

A: Yes. Take, for instance, ﬁSchindler™s List.ﬂ
 So because this was last one. Now, to me, 
ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ so happen
ed personally that I knew Schindler. ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ was 
a very good movie for the American people. Fo
r me, it didn™t even scratch the surface. It 
showed a lot of things, but wh at we went th
rough, it didn™t show you
 w -- that -- th-the 
real misery. But for the American, it s
howed  enough. One thing I liked  about 
ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ and the Polish people don™t 
like it, is there is one
 scene when the Jews 
were taken to the Kraków ghetto, and when they were chased
 away, and they were killed, 
and isn™t it -- there was a Polish girl stayingthere, a blond girl, and sh e said, ﬁGoodbye 

Jews, goodbye Jews.ﬂ It is typical, but the Po
lish people didn™t like it. Then a other thing 
they didn™t like that in Ausc hwitz, a lot of kapos spoke Polish; they were Polish girl. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
116
 
 
 
Because if a Polish girl was taken to Ausc
hwitz, she got a good job. For instance, from 
my  town , there is a girl Zoshka Vinyarska 
Esertanay. She was in Auschwitz, and sh e was 
in Au schwitz not for being a Jew, she was in
 au -- because she was caught with black 
market -- black market stu
ff. And sh e was taken to Auschwitz, she became a kapo. And 
she became such a --a -- at -- a -- a true -- fo r the Germans, that when she used to take 

children when there was 
an extermination job, a selection 
of the ch ildren, she had to take 
the children to the gas 
chambers. But there were always 
open pits with fire, because the 
gas chamber -- the -- th e crematoriums couldn™
t burn en ough. So  she 
used to take the 
children, and throw them in in
 the fire, alive. Now this gi
rl came from a town from where 
I was born. After the war, so long I was in 
Poland, she was hiding, because she -- I find 
out about it -- she knew that if I will get he
r, I will kill her. She di
dn™t know nuf -- now 
she lives in -- in our town, openly, people 
know about it. Noth ing happened to  her. She 
used to take live children and 
throw them in -- in the fire. 
Why did she do it? Sh e wasn™t 
asked to do it. 
Q: Did you ever testify ? You have seen a lo
t of killings. One -- one 
person, but also mass 
killings, you have been vit -- 
witnessing 400 people 
being killed. Did yo
u ever testify?  
A: No. I didn™t testify because the people who I would testify, they 
were not caught. My 
wife went to testify two or three times, 
because Krieger, who was the chief of the 
Gestapo there ma -- I -- the people who I sa
w them kill, like Tvardo, I wish -- and the 
others, Aihause, they were not 
caught, and I didn™t testify. I 
was te -- I was -- I la -- I was 
-- I wrote a letter, there was one Mac, a Gest
apo chief in Jheshuf, 
he was arrested, and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
117
 
 
 
there was a trial, and I wa -- I -- I wrote to 
them and said I want to tell -- because I saw 
him killing, but they never called me.  
Q: Did you meet any survivors from -- th
at you knew from -- fro
m -- from the war, or 
from even before in
 -- in America? 
A: Oh su re, we have organization. I am 
very active in the organization. We have 
organization of the Holocaust federation. 
I am a national executive board member, and 
we have -- and I am very, very
 much involved. As a matter of
 fact, that every year, we 
make, at Yom HaShoah the yea
r, and we -- and we -- and I am
 doing this for 30 years. 
And befo re we used to have it in Madison S
quare Garden, and for the last five years we 
have it in Temple Emmanuel. And I am in char
ge of the arrangement and secu rity. Before 
this it takes about six months to arrange it. I 
am with the police, with the fire department, 
with tran -- trans -- the transit, and ever -- 
and a -- we have meetings, and I -- and during 
the day I am there with the police, I arrange
 the security, because with the parking and 
everything. I am very mu ch involved. We 
had in our organization, we had 85,000 
memb ers. Now, we -- th-three years ago, we 
lost about seven percen
t, two years ago we 
lost 10 percent, and this year 
so far, we lost already 15 perc
ent, because people are dying 
out, you know. But I am very  much involved in it. 
Q: I was -- I was thinking ab out maybe you c
ould name one person fro
m your earlier life, 
that you met again here. I think you menti
oned you brought a gir -- a girl runner, who 
was a runner in Poland, did 
you bring her to New Yo rk? In
 the videotape? I thought you 
mentioned that. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
118
 
 
 
A: No, I bought not a runner, I bought -- I bought a Polish girl. 
Q: A Polish girl. 
A: But she was a runner between two -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- two Polish organizations, and she saved 
my life a few times. Bu
t here, I-I could give 
you a list of 200 people, so -- so that -- that
 I knew, that I met th
em here, and they live 
here, but now a lot of them dying out. A -- fro
m -- from my group, unfor
tunately, they are 
not alive, but -- but from other camps, and -- we 
always -- in -- in -- 
in -- like for instance 
now, we had, for a week we had the lectures in
 Rutgers, I think I told you this. Now, I -- I 
was lecturing th ere, and all of them who wu
 -- came to listen, were mostly a lot of 
survivors.  

Q: And what -- in your opinion, what are the 
lessons of the Holo caust, and has the world 
learned them? 

A: I don™t think so the world learned an
ything, cause if th e world will learn the 
Holo caust, you wouldn™t have Rw anda, you wo
uldn™t have an -- you wouldn™t have -- not 

Koso vo, and oh, what is the other place? 
Q: Bosn ia? 
A: No, no, no, we™ll talk abou
t Bosnia, and -- near Cambodia.
 [clock chiming] You see, 
you wouldn™t -- you wouldn™t ha
ve those things, because there are -- see, Bosnia, and ka -
- and -- and -- and -- and -- and Kosovo, it™s a di
fferent subject. It™s all [indecipherable] I 
don™t think so that Bosn ia a
nd Kosovo, that -- that -- that 
Clinton in America is hundred

percent right, because I think they did a very
, very bad thing, because of Milosevich is 
not an angel. He is a strong man, but -- but 
he™s -- what he is doing doesn ™t mean that 
America has a right to go a
nd bomb, and kill Kosovian ci
vilians, Serb civilians, he 
doesn ™t help the situation, and 
what does he do? He wants to 
show that this big America, 
the rich America is stronger 
than the poor Serb? So what™s
 a Serbian, nothing. A very 
poor country. So  they want to show that 
whole European countries, they going to be 
stronger. They da -- sh -- they 
should be made pe -- but there were o-other ways, but not 
to go and kill, and destroy bridges, dest
roy their economy, destroy every -- because 
Milosevich, supposedly , is not a nice fellow. 
There are other people, there were ways to 
do it. You had -- but not to go and bomb inno
cent people and to k
ill them. So what did 
they do? They killed 
them. They destroyed 
everything. So ame -- why? Because Clinton 
wanted to  get out as a hero, from being his pr
esidency to cover up 
Monica™s sins? This is 
not the right thing to  do. 
Q: So how do you feel abou
t American involvement then
, in those kind of -- 
A: They s -- no, the American involvement is
 -- in Kosovo was very bad, because why 
didn™t America get involved in Rwanda? Now, in Kosovo, it was not the Serb™s guilt. The 
Kosovian , they wanted to start a rebellion, a
nd to unite with Albani
a. They wanted to 
have a large Albania, a large Muslim nation.
 Then later they would take care on -- on 
Serbia. One thing I can tell you, that the Serb
s were the nicest people in the Ho locaust. 
The only one who saved Jews, the only one who 
took in and there -- Keeto took in in his 
ga -- in his underground Jew -- any Jew who wa
nted to go in. The 
next in -- in command

was a Jewish general, Pattie, I think was 
his name. He was a Jew. In the Polish 
underground you didn™t accept a Jew. So the Se
rbs were ver -- and th
ey were very good 
soldiers. Germany had 10 divisions SS. In Serb ia
 they couldn™t do anything, because they 
are very patriotic. So now, America wants to
 show they  are stronger than Serbia. Well, 
how -- to take the American army, the air 
force, and to destroy Serbia? For what? 
Because the alb -- the -- the -- the Albanese, th
ey had in their constitu
tion, they had, not 
in constitu -- in their rules, th
ey had that every mon -- every 
week, they have to kill three 
Serbian policemen. Every week th
ey kill a -- so they started 
it, they wanted to have a 
independence. They ha -- had the undergroun
d against Serbia. So 
what should Serbia 
say? Wait -- I will sit and wait 
til they kill us? So howa -- Serbia an-answered. And I 
don™t say that Milosevich was an angel, 
but the Serbian people didn™t deserve it. And 
what did they do? Not only th
e Serbian, they killed the Ko
sovian, too, because they 
bombed kos -- Kosovo. They  bomb ed -- they  de
stroyed everything what they  had, the 
people with the electricity, and bridges, an
d everything. So I think th at you cannot 
compare it with -- with any other. Ha -- why 
don™t America go to Tibet, and help them? 
Why do they -- don™t they go 
to the Kurds? There are 22 
million Kurds, and they -- wh-
what they are doing? America doesn™t go to 
help them. And th ey have a right to do 
something, because they
 are on their land. Koso vo was ne
ver a nation. For 800 years it 
was under Serbia. Besides, Serbia, all their 
religious and national th
ings are in Koso vo. 
The same thing as Jerusalem is for the Jews, 
Kosovo is for the Serbs. Now, they will go -
- Clinton will s -- next week he will go the 
Jews and will say, give away Jerusalem and

everything, if not, we going to  bomb you. This 
is very wrong. I wrote to them, I didn™t 
get an answer. So we -- so we fini
shed already the Kosovian business. 
Q: Almost. I want to get somehow back to y
our daughter, actually, but I think we™ll make 
that another tape. 

A: Okay . 
Q: This is the end of tape four, side
 B, interview with Norman Salsitz. 
A: Oh, so you have sa -- some
 people what do you have, four
 tapes, or you have mo re 
than four tapes? For some people? What 
is the mo st that you have from every 
[indecipherable] 
Q: Well, so far I have five, 
but we™ll probabl
y go beyond five. 
A: Oh, you have five?  
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: Oh, you have -- so far you ha
ve somebody talk so mu ch, five? 
Q: Well, if somebody is interestin g enough, we™
ll do that. So this was not the end, this is 
the end now of tape four, side B. 
A: Okay .

Beginning Tape Five, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holo caust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Norman Salsitz. This is tape 
number five, side A. I would like to know wh ether you can 
pinpoint, at least to some degree, the time 
when you felt comfortable with your identity 
as an American. And what 
did that mean to you?  
A: Well, I think that I felt right away very 
glad that I™m in America, the minute I came. 
Naturally, in the beginning, I was very unhap
py. I was glad that I™m
 in America, but I 
was very unhappy, and as a matter of fact, the 
first year, probably, I went around with  ma 
-- in my mind to commit 
suicide, for a few reasons. The firs
t thing,I looked
 around, and I 
didn™t have my  family. And I expected to ha
ve a family here, a new family, but I didn™t 
have it. And then, it is very -- I know peop
le who had this experience, maybe they will 
understand; you know, it is like
 you are on a very, big, beau
tiful horse, and you fall down 
from the horse. I was already in Poland, afte
r the war, I have a high position, I had -- I 
was established, I -- I ruled -- not ruled, bu
t I -- I could do a lot of things, and people 
respected me, and here I came over, and I wa
s nothing. In  America, later I find out, you 
could be smart, you could be intelligent, you 
could do -- be a lot of
 things, but if you 
didn™t have money, you have -- you are noth
ing. And I didn™t have money, and these 
things that -- what I did in Poland, and what
 I was in Poland, meant nothing There were a 
lot of people who, they were thankful, I did a 
lot of things for them 
in Poland, but when I 
came here, everything disappeared . So , of co
urse it was such a vacuum. I came down  
from -- from a high position, to nothing, and I 
was very disappointed. And I didn™t know 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
123
 
 
 
what will be the future, what I will do. Like 
I mentioned before, I di
dn™t have a trade, I 
didn™t have money, and I didn™t know wh at to
 do. So I was very -- th en -- then the -- the -
- the story with Israel this appears, that I 
didn™t go to Israel, which I wanted. And -- so I 
ask my -- question myself, I said, so what™s no
w? So a lot of times 
I went around with 
ideas that I probably -- 
the best thing is that I should co
mmit suicide, and the thing is a lot 
of times when I went in the car, and I start 
to think it will better when I wouldn™t come 
home alive. It™s very sad that I was thinking 
about it then, but this -- 
this was the reality.  
Q: But what did it mean to you
 to be an American at one 
point? Or was it not very sp-
spectacular [indecipherable] 
A: Well, in the beginning, it wa
s nothing -- like I said, I was 
glad that I™m here, because 
this was a dream that we have. Bu t I was not 
so happy, because I wa
s not in Israel. So 
this was -- see if you a dream only to be in  
America, and you are in America, so it™s 
different. But I was here, and -- and I have plans 
to go with  this group, I have plans to go 
with this group, and I couldn™
t go, one didn™t realize, and 
the -- with the group I couldn™t 
go, then  my  wife was against me going in  th
is time when it wa -- so, it -- it was not this 
what -- what I planned. So I was in America. 
See, if in America in 
this time, if I would 
have somebody from the family, and they  woul
d take me in, it was not so much as the -- 
the -- the material things that they would -- I 
didn™t ask for them, but to be in America, 
and to have a large family, to have cousins,
 and to be far away from them, I didn™t feel 
the warmth, and -- and this was more importa
nt, like I thought we will have -- we will 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
124
 
 
 
have friends. And who were the friends? The 
friends will be my cousins who were my 
age. And -- and I was a stranger to them. So 
this meant a very -- 
it was very painful. 
Q: Which -- which events in th
is country had a particular im
pact on you? Give me just 
sort of like one or two examples. 
A: Well, events that -- I would say the first 
ev ents was very important, they impact when 
they -- when I was in -- outside of the Un
ited Nation when they 
voted for accepting the 
petition of Palestine in this tim
e. W -- I was there, an -- and 
after they voted, and it was f 
-- by very  small vote that they won, and natura
lly outside the people started to sing, and 
to dance. So I think this was 
one of the most -- well, the fi
rst -- the first thing was with 
the -- which -- arriving in -- and to wait to see 
the Statue of -- of Liberty. This was the -- 
the -- the very -- very emotiona
l. And the second thing was wh
en Israel became a nation. 
This -- when I saw that the a
bba eben pulls up the Israel
 [indecipherable]. And I was 
there, so this meant a 
awful lot, because this was a drea
m which lasted 2,000 years. I only 
felt sorry that my father and my sisters are not
 alive to -- to live, a
nd to see it. B u t this 
was one of the -- of the mo st important things
 in -- in America. Well, then later there 
were other things, naturally wh
en  my  daughter was born. So th
is was one of the -- the mo 
-- because we waited a long time, and when 
she was born, so this was a very, very 
emotional thing. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit more about your daug
hter then, because we never quite continued 
talking about her. You said earlier that you 
pushed her away a little
 bit, unintentionally, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
125
 
 
 
by talking too early, but tell me
 a little bit more. What did th
at mean? How did she react, 
and how did you come together again? 
A: I-I didn™t push her away, but I talked too 
much about th
e Holocaust, and she was too 
young, and a -- she was not ready 
for it. So then later, when -- 
Q: But how did she respond to
 it? What was the response? 
A: She was not interested. Sh
e was not interested when I 
spoke, it™s like I saw some 
children where they are 
a little older, that everything th
 -- they -- they 
talk about the 
misery, and the bad times the parents went th
rough, and -- and she -- she didn™t react like 
this. Later she explained it™s because I starte
d to talk about the Ho
locaust too much, too 
early, and she didn™t care for it. But then la
ter, as she got older, so she started -- she 

realized now -- she™s still not very what -- 
what I would say very involved. Like for 
instance, I have a lot of friends, and their children --  there is a 
movement of second 
generation, and she doesn™t be
long to second generation. I 
ask her a few times. And -- by 
the way, her husband, who is 
a fifth generation American, he
™s more -- more in volved -- 
not involved, but he™s more fo
r the remembrance of
 the Holocaust than
 -- than she is.  
Q: Does that hurt you? 
A: No -- not that it hur -- yes, it hurts me one thing, because she doesn™t rememb er so 
much -- my sisters -- an
-and it hurts me  because we depe
nd on the second generation, on 
the future generation, that th
e Ho locaust shouldn™t be fo rgotten. And if she is not very 
much involved, so it means that it will not be
 remembered so
 much. And after all, she 
feels very bad that she didn™t -- that she al
ways cried, she didn™t have a grandfather, a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
126
 
 
 
grandmother. Like for instance, she had here 
a friend, she had two sets of grandmothers, 
so she always has questioned them, when they  knew about it, so one set of grandfather 
[indecipherable] they adopted 
her. So I would like she should be more involved, because 
we are so -- I am so mu ch 
involv ed, not so much my  wife. I involved because I belong to  
every organization -- Holo caust organization, 
and everything what has to be done, I™m 
very mu ch  involved . I™m involved with the 
-- with the -- the money part, I™m involved 
with speaking, to go -- meetings, a
nd all those things, I am involved. 
Q: I -- I -- I would like -- I would follow up in
 just a -- to another question about your 
work, and we™ll talk more about 
this, but let me just stick with
 your daughter. What is her 
-- give me h-her name, and wh at did -- was he
r education? She is a law -- she™s a lawyer? 
A: She -- her name is Esther, her -- Esther Sy
lvia. Esther she is made -- named after my 
mother, and Sylvia after my wife™s siste
r, who was killed when she was 17 years. And 
her maiden name is -- I mean marriage name 
is Dezube, D-e-z-u-b-e. Some people don™t 
realize, they think it™s not a Jewish name, th
at it is a Italian name, but I mentioned that 
her -- her husband™s is the fifth generation Am
erican, and -- and it used to be Dezubinsky, 
which is a Russian name for a 
dentist, something. But then 
later this was changed. And 
she™s a lawyer. She has her own office, and sh
e employs a other lawyer, with a secretary, 
and she -- she™s satisf i ed with 
her -- we wanted she should be a doctor, b-because my  wa 
-- my wife was it, but she didn™t like it, she 
didn™t want, she wanted to be a lawy er. And 
she always was very good with  the debating, 
and talking. And as a matter of fact, when 
she was in college, sh -- the lawyer, or the 
-- the -- the professor 
[indecipherable] said, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
127
 
 
 
ﬁYou should be a lawyer.ﬂ Well she -- she -- maybe this -- she has a little bit from me, I 
don™t know. And [indecipherable] she married th
e husband, he is a medical doctor. He is 
now assistant professor in Harvard, and he is in
 Beth Israel Hospital, and he is the head -- 
he is oncologist hematologist, and now he™s 
the head -- he started 
t o  wo rk  with  AIDS 

research, and he goes around a
ll over the world, and they  send 
him to have lectures. As a 
matter of fact, he just came back from -- he 
was in Japan, he was in Hungary, he was -- 
he goes over -- and they have to go now, in 
about a month, they ha
ve to go to Portugal. 
And he™s also now a memb er of the Food a
nd Drug industry; he goes once a month to 
Washington, because when
 they have a new drug, that has 
to be approved. So he is very 
dedicated to it, and in the beginning we were a little worried th
at he picked out the AIDS, 

but he wants it because h-he™s a 
idealist. He™s -- he™s very mu
ch involved in it. And we -- 
the beginning we were 
wor -- worried a little because we th
ought that doctors, contagious 
this, but now it™s -- it changed a lot. An-And -- 
and he -- he™s happy, 
and he likes it, and -
- and now -- we want he should be for -- he s
houldn™t be in that hospital, because if he 
will be a private doctor, he could make much 
more money. But he doesn ™t care about the 
money. So -- 
Q: You also have grandchildren. When  -- 
A: Yeah, I have three -- three grandchildren.
 And this was also one of the highlights of 
our life. When the first one was born, he wa
s born in -- about three years after she was 
married. She was married -- my daughter was married in -- in -- it was just 22
nd
 
anniversary for her. So her d -- Dustin is now 
16 and a half years old. He is the oldest 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
128
 
 
 
one. Then  she has one, he is Arlen. Arlen is 
11 years old. And then  she has one, he is 
Michael. And Michael is -- is nine years old, yeah. 
Q: Is -- is their observant house, or is it -- 
A: Well, you see, we -- our -- for instance by
 us, everything what is tradition, I keep up. 
It™s not observant. We don™
t have kosher, and we don™t do serf shab -- the Shema 
Shabbas as we call it. But w -- it™s more like 
-- like everything traditional, every national 
holiday, and -- so -- well a -- so -- but se 
-- m-my wife, she does
n™t come from such a 
home. She comes from a home that -- see, in
 Europe, everybody 
was -- was religious. 
Q: Shall we [indecipherable] for a second? 
A: N -- I no --  
Q: All right, is it [indecipherable] 

A: So, w -- everything what is traditional, 
I w -- as you can see upstairs -- you didn™t see 
it, I have like an Jewish mu seum. Everything 
what has a Jewish character I buy, and I like 
to collect. And I have certain things that they
 are so unique, that it™
s probably  the one in 
the world. And if you are intere
sted, I can explain to you, I ca
n show it to you. And so, if 
I have guests, like for instance
 Saturday s we don™t make th
e observance like it should be, 
but if I have guests for this, I do it. See, 
I know how to  do it, [indecipherable] because 
like I said, til 17 years I started, an d I don™t know if you™ll say to be a rabbi, or to what, 
but I -- we were very, very in
-involved in it. So -- but now,
 after the war, n -- everything 
what has to do with the connection, with -- 
with the -- with the G
od, we let it go a little 
bit, because we each were asking a question, a
nd we don™t have answ ers. My daughter for 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
129
 
 
 
instance -- and my  daughter is mo re observant 
than we are. And -- like for instance, every 
Friday night, and -- she lights the candles, 
and her children come, and everyone has to 
wear a kippah, and then they say the blessings,
 and they sing wh at th
ey have to do. Also  
because they  go to So
lo mon Shechter, which is a religi
ous Jew telly school, and they go 
partly to Solomon Shechter, be
cause I pay for it. And I said to them if they will go to 
Solomon Shechter, I would pay, 
and this is quite expensive,
 because -- because it cost 
almost 10,000 dollars a year for each one. No
w, her husband, for instance, comes from a 
house that they didn™t know too mu ch about
 Judaism. Now, her husband™s parents, like 
for instance his father™s sibli
ngs, they all married por -- Protestants. His mother™s ma -- 
family ma rried Catholics. So -- but none 
of them married Jews -- well, one maybe 
married Jews. So her husband, because he was a
fraid that with them 
the Jewish tradition, 
everything would get lost, so he
 became more Jewish. And he
 did it himself, he asked for 
it, and as a matter of fact, in his sophomore year
 he went to Israel, a
nd he went for a year 
to Israel, but he didn™t go on th e English facu
lty -- English part, but the Hebrew . And he 
speaks perfect Hebrew. He ri -- an d he gets 
all the Hebrew  newspapers, and he™s very 
much involved with Israel. The 
oldest son, til he was three years, he spoke to him only 
Hebrew, because he -- he though
t English he would 
learn anyway. So they are very much 
-- they belong to a temple, and 
with the children they
 go to temple. Now,
 for instance, the 
Israeli government sends over certain people, a
nd -- for a year to be on Harvard, or in 
MIT. So there are certain families that they ad
opt a family for a yea
r, so they adopt every 
year a family. And they stay 
with them Saturdays,
 holidays, because it™
s ver -- and they 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
130
 
 
 
were a few times, like for instan
ce the oldest boy went yest
erday to Israel, and he™s 16 
and a half, and there is a group. 
It™s called gesh -- Geshert. So th
ey -- it™s -- it is like they 
are part with the milit -- milita
ry part. They go th ere for six weeks, a
nd then they travel. 
So he went with the group, they  went abou
t 150 American -- 50 were
 boys, hundred were 
girls, and their age, and they went there, wh ich we agree to what they should go. And it is 
very important. 
Q: Just a few minutes ago, you menti
oned your -- one -- one part of your many 
collections, so I would like to 
talk a little bit more 
about your recent activities. There are 
a -- a lot of them, but maybe you can give
 us a sort of a sampling, a brief -- 
A: Well, I -- 

Q: -- you have written books, you give talks. 

A: Yeah, I -- I -- the activities, like for instan
ce, I organized, 30 years ago, a chapter here 
from Mogandube tadome, Mogandube tadome, as
 they say the Red Cr
oss, and fo-for 30 
years I™m the president. I™m trying to give
 it to somebody, ther
e is nobody who will -- 
takes it. And we are a memb er from the nationa
l, and we went a few times with them to 
Israel, and now it starts to 
go down , like all Jewish organi
zations, and th e new people 
don™t go in, and old people dyi
ng out, and I say that my  memb ers -- I used to have a few 
hundred members in this chapter, now I have ve
ry little, so I said all 
the members, or they 
go up, or they go down. So th
ey said, ﬁWhat do you mean?ﬂ 
I said, ﬁOh, they go down to 
Florida, or they go up to he
aven .ﬂ And this is mo stly what -- what happened, the new 
people doesn™t come in. Also, I organized 
Gimmilis hassoudim organization, it m -- is a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
131
 
 
 
free loan society. This was after I came to Am
erica, so I started to organize with the -- 
with the people here, and we took a -- collected
 money, we send it to Israel. And in this 
time the people were very poor, and ev erybody 
had a chance to loan -- to take a loan, 
then they paid it out in a year, 
and two years, and they  got back. 
So this is still there -- al -
- existing. My -- this was the [indecipherable]
 that mis -- the people
 from my town have 
it. So then I belong to
 a lot of organization, like I orga
nized in our temp le a Israel bond 
drive, and the -- the UGA drive. I was, for 
about seven years, the chairman of Israel 
bonds for Essex county religious
 council, and -- and I -- I alwa
ys was involved in -- in -- 
in -- in all kind of -- of charitable organizations. 
Q: Wh-W hen did you star
t giving talks in schools, or p
ublic talks, and what -- what -- 
where have you been ? Just to schools, and -- or other areas? 
A: No, no. I -- I -- well, peop
le started to know about me, so one from the others, and I 
will say in the last 10 years. So I go public 
schools, high school
s, and sometimes not 
Jewish high schools. And I also spoke right
 in Princeton. They i
nvited me, I spoke in 
Harvard. And I spoke in -- in -- in Connectic
ut they have Notre Dame University. And 
this was very important for me, because they
 were not Jews there. And -- and there is 
even it™s not a anecdote, is wh
en I came to Notre Dame, they
 invited me there for a day, 

but they kept me there for three days, because 
when the -- this is a Jesuit school, and they 

are dressed like priests. So wh
en they introduced
 me to the headmaster, and he had a 
book under his arm, that he had the book, 
so he had the book, th
e ﬁJewish Boyhood in 
Poland,ﬂ my book. So I was ve
ry pleased, I said, ﬁOh, you go
t the book because I came to 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
132
 
 
 
speak here?ﬂ He said, ﬁNo.ﬂ So I said, ﬁD
o you know whose book this is?ﬂ He said, 
ﬁNo.ﬂ ﬁSo how comes you have the book?ﬂ 
He said to me, ﬁI just came from 
Washington, from the museum, 
and I saw this book, and I saw that the book is, ﬁA 
Jewish Boyhood in Poland, Remembering Ko
lbushova,ﬂ my town. So
 happens that my 
grandfather came from Kolbushova.ﬂ So he br
ought the book. So he 
told me his name, I 
remem -- so I rememb er his grandfather, and he -- his father came to  America, h e was 
born here, and he is the head 
of the Notre Dame University. So instead one day, he kept 
me there three days. And -- and [indecipherab le] 

Q: Y-You ju  -- you just mentioned one bo
ok, you -- earlier, throughout the -- this 
interview, you had mentioned 
-- you di -- never said the t
itle, but you always referred 
back to a book. 
What is the other book called? 
A: Well, the first book -- the first book, it wa
s printed in 1961, and th is was printed in 

Israel, and this book in -- in 
the English, it is a memorial b
ook for my town. And in the -- 
in -- all it™s -- in Yiddish it™s called , ﬁK
olbushova Pinkus.ﬂ Pi
nkus is memor -- a 
memorial b o ok. And it™s a very good book, it™s 
one of the -- because 
every town gave out 
-- called the yeeska book, a memo rial book. An
d this is one of the best, because it has 
1400 pages, and it has about a few hundred ph
-photos. So it™s a very
 good book, specially 
for the people from my town, th
ey  didn™t have the pictures. So
 this was in the -- in ™61. 
And then now, people a lot, ch
ildren, they want to have th
e book, but it™s not available. 
The only time I got the book is wh en some
body dies, and th e children don™t know 
Yiddish, so I buy back from them, and I could gi
ve it to them. This is the first o n e, then I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052

had a lot of articles and papers, that two, thr
ee, four times a year in the -- in the ﬁJewish 
News,ﬂ and there are some good articles. Like, 
for instance, last year I had an article, and 
it was reprint -- reprinted in 25 different pa
pers, because it goes from one, they take it. 

And then later I -- I got copies from the other papers. It was from California, from 

Florida. Now I even got a copy from a paper fro
m London, that they 
got a -- a -- reprinted 
this article from -- in
 London, and somebody send it to
 me. And then came out a book, 
ﬁAgainst All Odds,ﬂ which is -- was very su
ccessful, and then after against all is, ﬁA 
Jewish Boyhood in Poland, Re
membering Kolbushova.ﬂ This is
 my youth in
 Kolbushova. 
And now, two other books will come out this 
year, which I told you one is being written 
by Amy Hill Hart. This is the 
author of, ﬁHaving Ou r Say,ﬂ which became very popular, 
and it was a show on television, and 
it selled over two million copies, and -- 
Q: That book is about your life? 
A: This -- no. 
Q: No. 

A: The book from Amy Hill Hart? No. This is
 -- because she™s the daughter of German 
immigrants, and this -- because she wrote th
is book aga -- ﬁHavin
g Our Say.ﬂ This is 
about a minority, about Negroes, children of sl
aves. So she wanted to write aga-again a 
book about minorities, and beca
use it was such a successful. And she wrote in -- in -- in 
papers, and in -- in Associated Press, about
 me, about when I collected the six million 
pennies. And sh e wrote it, so she got in touc
h with us, and sh e said she would like to 
write a book about us, about our life during the 
Holocaust, from the -- 
so we told her we 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
134
 
 
 
have already two books. She said no, she 
wants to write it from the viewpoint of a 
German. So this was -- for this we were in terested, because we wanted to see how she 
will -- she will handle, how she will approach. 
So she had interviews, and we sent -- she 
was even to Israel, and she went to Yad Vash
em, she went to the mu
seum to see all those 
things, because she didn™t know too much  about the Holocaust, and we arranged 

interviews with the directo
r, and with the director from 
ADL, from -- with Mr. Foxman, 
with Elie Wiesel, with others, and so she -- 
she just finished the 
book, we don™t agree 
with everything. Not that we d
on™t agree, she let out and she ha
d -- but she said this is the 
first draft, probably there will be a few draf
ts. And she wants to have -- because she can 
have publishers where she™s 
now known, because her book wa
s such a success. It was a 
show on -- in -- in Broadway
, and then it was on television, on ch annel two, and it was 
sold over two million pa -- copies. It was fo
r six months the best
 seller on New York 
Time list. So -- so we are preparing this book
, and then  I prepare th
is book what I told 
you, with the vignettes, which I™m very much 
interested in the vigne
ttes, because this is 
stories that didn™t go in in 
the first book, in the second book,
 in th e third book. Those are 
stories that I don™t want to let them out. St
ories from before the war, stories from the war, 
from cruelties, from -- so I have this, and I 
have the title, so we wo
rked this. And then 
later, when I wa -- finished th
ose two books, which I think it 
will be this year, so then 
later we™ll think about something else. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
135
 
 
 
Q: Well, two -- two -- two fo
llow up questions. One is, what
 -- how do you ev aluate the 
impact that survivor testimoni
es and recollections like yours
 have had on the collective 
Ho lo cau st memo ry  
in this country, if you will? 
A: I think th is is very important, becaus
e the survivors co -- testimonies is more 
important than even reading 
a book. Because, you see like fo
r instance, I was not long 
ago I was in the -- to speak in 
a -- in -- in a school, and ther
e was -- it wasn™t -- there were 
not Jewish students, there were mostly Ch
ristians. So the -- w
ho -- with they -- the 
teacher, when they introduce, 
they said, ﬁYou -- we -- I wa
nt we should see this man, 

because in a few years, you™ll be
 able to say, I saw a surviv
or, because then there will not 
be survivors. So you saw the survivor, and y
ou heard it from a survivo
r.ﬂ So this is very 
important when  you go to schools, and then
 -- when you did -- it™s 
also depends how you 
tell the story. Now, when I go -- so I ask alwa
ys how old the children are, if they are -- 
what nationality they are, wh-what a -- what  ethnic background. It™s very important 

because you have to tell them stor -- different
 stories. Now in -- how old, and how many -
- and I never prepare a speech. When I prepare 
a speech, it™s a fiasco. I have to come and 

look at the faces, and then I speak. As you 
can see, I cannot -- I cannot read a speech. 
Now, not long ago I was in Elizabeth, and 
this was three high schools put together, and 
there were about -- I would say about 250 st
udents, not one White, 
all of them Black. 
And it was a different experience. And I to
ld them, and natura
lly I compared the 
Holocaust with -- with the life 
of the Black people in America.
 Se -- so you have to cater 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
136
 
 
 
to each one different. So for this reason I 
ask what nationality, what -- not so much 
nationality, what religion and -- and ag e, and it™s so you -- 
Q: D-Do  you -- do you find the student
s in schools very open and interested? 
A: Yes, they are very interest
ed. It™s also depends how you 
tell the story, because I went 
to some -- to some -- someb
ody spoke, and because we were two, and when  the other 
person sp oke, so the teach -- the students were 
talking to each other, they didn™t have no 
interest, because -- I didn™t blame them, beca
use the way the person talked, it was very 
monotonous, and -- and then later when  I spoke,
 they had a different interest. I was in a 
school, and they had ab out 400 ch
ildren, so then the principal 
came to me, he said, ﬁI can 
tell you only one thing. This is the first time th
at they were sitting for two hours, and they  
listened. And th ey -- I could never keep th
em for so long, and they  should have a 
interest.ﬂ A g ain, I see what the children -- what
 interest it is. Now, if you go, and you see 

la -- when I speak to a Jewish group, and wh
en the Jewish group is let™s say between 16 
and seven -- 15 and 17 years, I don™t tell them 
stories about the death camp s. They  have 
no interest about the death cam
ps. They  want to know wh at did th e Jews do. Ho w did 
they protect themselves. So th
en I tell them storie
s about my activity in
 the underground, 
in the woods. This what they wa
nt to know. They want to kn
ow if I did something, if I 
killed somebody, if I -- this 
-- this what they in
to, they™re not intere
sted in Auschwitz. 
They are not interested se -- 
in the -- in the ovens, and the 
cruelty, what the Germans did. 
This is ha -- no. They  -- the same thing in 
Israel, and I spoke in Israel, the children are 
interested what did the Jew do. And if you 
tell them a story from a underground, from a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
137
 
 
 
resistance, from this, this what 
they associate, and this whatthey like to hea
r. So for this 
reason you have to fa -- you ha
ve to face the people, and to
 see what they have -- what 
interest they have.  
Q: Do you think that in -- in 
general, even wh en you came 
to -- to America, w as there a 
little bit more appreciation of -- of the re
sistan ce fighters? Of people who had done 
something because just -- you ju st bring -- 
bring th at up as something that™s of 
importance. 

A: Yes, yes, there was,  but nobody knew abou t it. There was, like fo
r instance, t h ey were 
very -- with everybody, like now you -- wh en
 you speak about the resistance, you speak 
about the Warsaw ghetto. Now, there were a 
lot of resistance story, but the Warsaw 
ghetto, this is the emblem, this
 is the -- the -- the main thi
ng that -- that you talk about 
resistance. It was important, because this was 
the first resistance in  Europe against the 
Germans. And also, the resistanc e was in Wa
rsaw -- the resistance was in Warsaw, where 
they didn™t have no help. It -- 

Q: I™m sorry, I have to interrupt. We
 have to -- to change the cassette. 
A: Okay . 
Q: This is the end of side A, tape 
five, interview with Norman Salsitz. 
A: Okay . 
End of Tape Five, Side A 
Beginning Tape Five, Side B 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
138
 
 
 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Norman Salsitz. This is ta
pe number five, side B. 
A: So we spoke about -- about [indeciphera
ble] didn™t know too mu ch . And th en -- now 
the Warsaw uprise, this is the 
main thing, which was a very 
important thing, because they 
didn™t fight to win a war, because this wasn™t
 how -- because they kn
ew that they would 
be killed. This was only for a fi
ght to pay back a little bit, to
 take revenge. Not to go and 
be killed without killing somebody else, and also
 to show that there are -- there is some 
resistance. This is for the ho
nor of the Jews, for the honor 
of the Jewish flag. And there 
were other camps that they were resistance, b u
t people don™t know about it, it -- very few. 
Like for instance, there is a 
film, I -- probably you saw it, is
 the, ﬁEscape from Sobibór.ﬂ 
Did you see this? It™s a very powerful vide
o, and -- and how they  tried to save m -- 
unfortunately from the people who escaped, they
 all practically were killed by the Poles, 
very few survived. As a matter of fact, 
the man who was the leader, his name was 
Friedlander, he was the leader and the organizer 
of this revolt, he -- after he escaped, he 

somehow surviv ed, and he went back to his sm
all town, he opened  a small store, and six 
months later he was killed by the natives, by 
his friends, after he went out from Sobibór. 
So this is a very -- it™s a big tragedy that ev
en the people who did something, they were s 
-- they were killed later. Now, I have friends
 who were in the resistance in different 
places, but after the war, they were killed. 
Now -- now, take for instance, Treblinka, it 
was the most horrible camp, because Treblin
ka was not con -- con -- was not converted 
from a labor camp. This was built as a death ca
mp, and they -- everything was done there 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
139
 
 
 
for the death camp. It was very
 terrible. 700,000 people were
 killed there. And when you 
say 700,000 dollars, I say it so fast, like -- lik
e -- like we will count 700 dollars. So the -- 
an -- and from Treblinka they had also 
revolt and escape. From the escape on -- 600 
escape, and how they escaped. 
Not from the people who had to be killed, from the people 
who were the permanen t prisoners, who did 
the undressing, taking out the gold from the 
teeth, and from the 600, 40 survived fro
m the -- from th e 600, cause on the -- fr -- 
through the time they were kille
d. There is even a story that a Polish group, two Polish 
people found 12 people from Tr
eblinka hiding in the woods,
 and they killed them. And 
when after -- after the war, so
mebody denounced them, and th ey
 were taken to court, and 
they got -- those two got three years jail fo
r killing the 12 people. And after three years, 
they were -- came out, and imagine, for k
illing 12 people who es
caped from Treblinka, 
they got three years. After they
 escaped, and they -- they we
re living in Poland, and later 
when  the govern ment changed, it wasn™t 
any mo re a Communist govern ment, in 1989, 
when -- after Lech Walesa, 
when they had the solidarity
. So the people sued the 
government that they were arre
sted in -- and they 
-- and they were in jail three years. And 
the reason why they sued
 the government, they 
said they killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits. 
The people were Jewish Bo lshevik band
its. Now, the people escaped from Sobibór, 
they™re hide -- they were  hidden -- them -- th
ey hid themselves in 
the woods. So they 
said that they were Jewish 
Bolshevik bandits, and the reason 
they killed them is because 
they were good Polish patriots
, and they wanted to kill th
e Bolshevik band
its. And this 
what they -- when they ki -- th
ey say -- they sued 
the government. So th
 -- so one got in -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
140
 
 
 
from the government, they ga
ve him something, 400 milli
on zlotas, which it was not 
millions, it came out to about 40,000 dollars co
mpensation because they
 were three years 
in jail. Because they say tha -- this what -- 
they killed the Jews doesn™t mean anything, 
but they say they killed Jewish
 Bolshevik bandits. A
nd -- so th -- after th
is, w h en they got 
this in court, so about 300 Poles who were arrested for killing Jews, all of them started to 
sue the government, that they 
say that we killed Jewish Bols
hevik bandits. And it™s a very 
unfair. Now, I got -- when -- when I™m prepar
e -- I™m preparing now the new book, so I 
got a order from Bukonroffsky. Bukonroffsky wa
s the head of the Po
lish underground in 
Poland, from the AK, General 
Bukonroffsky. So I got a order from Bukonroffsky, from 
September 1943, that he gave a order to all 
Polish AK members, that
 they should go out 
in the woods, and to find th
e Jewish Bolshevik bandits, a
nd to kill them. And this is 
when, about three months later, w h en I appr
oached my  friend, he should take in my  
group, into his group, and th en
 when they sh ot me, probably this was on account of the 
order that they have to kill all -- and also
 the order said, first you have to kill the 
commandant, and once the commandant will be k
illed, it will be easy to kill the rest of 
the group. So for this reason, pr
obably, they got -- wa
nted to get rid of me, and then later 
they would kill the rest of us. 
So I got from England, I got th
e original order, the date, the 
number, because tho -- this is in
 the archives of this Polish
 underground, which is still in 
London. 
Q: And I™d like to come back 
for the last two questions to
 America, and you mentioned 
before the Holocaust mu
seum in Washington, D.C., and al
so Yad Vashem in -- in Israel. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
141
 
 
 
How do you see the role of th
e Ho locaust mu seum here, and 
do you keep  up with some 
of the politics that are swirling around? And 
let™s -- the first question first, how do you 
see the role of the museum here? 
A: Well, the role of the mu seum, I am very 
disappointed, is because the mu seum actually 

-- this is -- it is a government institution, it 
is a government museum. Now, for this reason 
I was very much for Dr. Roya
ch , because Dr. Royach was very dedicated, and he wanted  
-- he did not need this job, be
cause he had a very good prac
tice, he™s a psychiatrist. But 
he wan -- because I know, I had discussions w
ith him before he took the job, because he 
didn™t want to take the job in fir-first place. T h en later -- and I talked him in -- well, in -- 
Q: He was the previous director? 
A: He was the previo us director, and he sp
oke to me, naturally he didn™t take on my  
work, but he ask me w h at I think about it, we
 are very good friends. So he wanted -- he 
wa -- took this job, because he wanted it sh
ould be a Jewish mu seum. It should be -- it -- 
the Holocaust shouldn™t be wate red down. Because there was a 
case that the -- some other 

nationalities or other ethnic groups came in, and they said well, we had a Holocaust. 

Holocaust was for the Jews. Th
e Polish people say Polish Ho lo
caust. Poland didn™t have 
a Holocaust, because by Jews, ev
ery Jew had to be killed. No 
-- in -- in Poland, if you did 
something wrong, th ey arrested you. If you we
re in the underground, they caught you 
with weapons, they caught you
 with black mart -- mark -- ma
rket, so they arrested you. 
And wi -- and if they  arrested you, it doesn™t me
an that the whole family had to be killed. 
By Jews is -- they™re like Elie
 Wiesel said, not all victimswere Jews, but all Jews were 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
142
 
 
 
victims. So -- so he wanted 
to keep it as a Je wish museum
, and -- and -- and now, wh en 
he is on -- now that he receive
d the best proof, he was pushed
 out because he didn™t want 
Arafat should come as a Head of State. First 
thing, Arafat was not a Head of State, and th 
-- he said if Arafat was not such a Jew lover, 
and if he wanted to s -- that they said to 
learn about the Holo caust, he had Yad Vash em
 right under his nose. And he knew very 
well what the Holocaust is, because if Arafat 
will come as a Head of State, they had to 
close the museum, and give him the VIP treatm
ent, and he was against it. And for this 
reason he was fired. So he -- I am afraid 
that this will be wa
tered down, that the 
Holocaust, the Jewish 
Holocaust will be watered down, 
because other people will came -- 
come in. Like there was once in
 -- in a -- what was it, not a -- no, Croatia wanted to make 
a -- make something about the Holocaust, and Croatia was -- they were the worst 

murderers in -- in the world.
 They had the Oestasha, the 
Oestasha killed thousands and 
thousands of Serbs, thousand an
d thousands of -- of Jews, a
nd now they are the victims, 
the victims of the Holocaust. No
w, they were collaborators w
ith Germany. They were not 
occupied by Germany, they 
were collaborators, it was never occupied by Germany. So  
this -- so I think that the Holocaust museum
 will be watered down, because it will not be 
strict that it™s a Jewish 
Holo caust, where Yad Vashem 
is only a Jewish Holo caust, 
because they don™t have other ethnic groups to
 be Yad Vashem, and to do -- to say, well, 

this was my Holocaust. And -- so it™s a bi
g difference. Now you have a other -- a -- a 
memorial museum in -- in Ne
w York. Now this is a new 
story, because this is a 
Holocaust museum, but it has three tiers. The fi rst one when you go in
, this -- they show 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
143
 
 
 
you the book -- the -- the life of
 Jews from before the war. A
nd if you go in, you will see 
there™s some of my pictures 
there. Then  you have -- you ha
ve the -- the second floor is 
the Holo caust, and the third floor is how th e 
Jews picked up their 
life after the Holocaust. 
It™s a whole different -- it™s a -- it™s a all diffe
rent story. Bu t in Washington, I am afraid 
that the -- that the people who are now in
 charge, they will water down the Jewish 
Holocaust, and they -- they are artifacts, I gave
 them a lot of artifacts there what they 
have. But they arti -- and this was the reason th
at Dr. Royach was pushed out, because he 
wanted it should be a Jewi
sh Holocaust museum, wa -- 
that the Holo caust was only 
Jewish. 
Q: I have only one question left
 for you. Is there anything that I didn™t ask you, or that 
you haven™t mentioned yet that
 you th ink is very important
? And you can think about it 
for a second. On e or two th ings. One or two things. 

A: Well, to be -- which is important that -- l
ook, we can talk and talk, there is a lot of 
things important, but, about th
e Holocaust I think the most important thing is, is not to 
forget that there was a Holo
caust. Because we cannot have 
the six million people die in 
vain. And in vain I mean they die, and th
ere will be no remembrance, and there will not 
be no -- ho-how should I say it? That the peop
le should not cry afte
r them, because they 
died for no reason at all. That 
we should talk abou
t them. So this is very important. And -
- and the boo -- all the books, 
every book which is written, 
from every Holocaust, if the 
book is good, if the book is bad. So me are 
better, some are not so
 good, but ev erybody 
has to tell a story, and it™s -- I encourage always when  people say well, I want to write a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
144
 
 
 
book, I encourag e them, and if 
I can help them in any way, 
I do. Because everybody has a 
different story. So naturally 
some book are not so important
, they are not -- but still, it™s 
an important thing, because this is written 
by a survivor, and if he survived, it is 
important. [clock chiming]. Well, so this is
 -- this is mostly wh at, you know, so th e 
children should be -- they should be taught
 -- they should be rem-reminded, and they 
should be told abou
t the Holocaust. Because, if the chil
dren of my sisters, who were three 
and a half, four, five years old, if they w
ill know that 50 years la
ter, somebody will speak 
about them, maybe their life,
 their death wouldn™tbe so
 horrible. There will say 
somebody will remember me 50 y
ears later. But if -- and also, I want -- now I have my -- 
I have my  pictures that I 
saved, 500 photos. I reme mb er the names, I reme mb er the 
organizations they belong, and I want now to
 have an album. I don™t know if you ev er 
saw Vishniak™s album. There was a man tha --
 he wrote -- he had pictures from life 
[indecipherable] in Jews. I want to have 
this album. The reason why -- and I want to 
mention everybody who is in the pictures
, everybody™s name, because I want that 
someday -- not someday, this -- everybody™s 
name should be mentioned. It shouldn™t be 
like he lived like -- like come
s in autumn, the l
eaves dry out, the wind co mes, blows 
away the leave, and the leave 
disappears, like this was never -- it was never a leave. It™s 
the same th ing, I don™t want that the pers
on who lived, and the Holo
caust killed them, the 
people were killed, and they disappeared, an
d the name was never me
ntioned. Because he 
was a human being, he was alive, he had dreams
. He wanted to live, 
and to have a future, 
to have ch ildren, have grandc
hildren. But he was wiped out. 
So  I want this person, should 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
145
 
 
 
be written down that there was a man who lived. 
I have his picture. And then the pictures 
should see this is how he look
ed. This what I want, and this 
what my  dream is, to have an  
album with everybody™s picture, it should be 
recorded that there was once a ma n like this, 
and he was destroyed. So there 
are certain things that I still 
would like to do. And if I will 
do it, I don™t know. I try.  
Q: My last question has sort of two part
s. One is, you mentioned in the videotaped 
interview that you didn™t want
 to come to America, but 
you -- you went, 
and you never 
thought you could as -- achieve as mu ch as
 you have. My  question -- my  first question 
then is, what did you achieve? 
A: Well, yeah, I didn™t want to come Americ
a, because -- I think I explained to you, my 
aim was -- my dream was a -- 
Q: Yes, but what did -- but wh at did -- 
A: -- and then when I came America, like I said
 to you that when I -- in the beginning, I 
couldn™t make a living, I didn™t have a job, an
d I was nobody, because here in America is 
-- even if you are nobody, but when  you ha
ve money, you give charity, you become 
somebody. So then , wh at I achi
eved, I established a business, 
I established certain things 
that -- donations. I helped my family in -- in 
Israel if I could. I -- 
and -- and -- and -- I -- I 
am involved in -- in a lot of organizations, 
and -- and people know me. Like, for instance, 
if we go someplace, and my wife is always, 
see this is Norman Sa
lsitz, he wrote this 
article, nor -- so this is an achievement, th
at I am someb o dy, and it doesn ™t mean that I 
have to make money out of it, but I want to
 be involved, and I am
 involved. Some people 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052
 
 
146
 
 
 
they -- they didn™t want to be involved. And ev
er -- if I belonged to organization, I cannot 
just belong to organization, and to say, we
ll I -- I belong to organization, I pay dues and 
that™s it. If I belong to org -- organization, 
I have to be active. Ot
herwise I don™t belong to  
the organization. And achievement is like thre
e years ago, I -- I was the man of the year 
here in -- in Springfield. [i
ndecipherable] made a nice -- and a f -- and a few years before, 
from Israel, once, I was honored. This was a 
-- this is an achievement that I am doing 
something, and then the people
 try to -- to pay back someth
ing. Not in money, but some 
acknowledgement. And everybody wants to have
 some acknowledgement. So this what I 
meant, that in America, I started to make a 
living, maybe a little bette
r than -- more than a 
living, and -- and we live like -- like American
 people. Live a nice house. My  daughter 
got married, I bought her a house. She opened 
her office in Bo ston, I bought her a -- I 
bought her a -- a office in 
Boston. Two week s ago I went, and I bought her a house in 
New Hampshire. She wanted a house on th
e -- on the -- on the lake, it to -- should be 
close to where the ski -- beca
use they going skiing every week
end in the winter, so this 
will be close. So this is an achievement, th
at I could do it for my daughter. Now, I don™t 
know if she could do it on her own, but if I di
d it, and for my grandchildren, this is an 
achievement. 
Q: Well, maybe that was already the answer to 
my very last question, but let me say this. 
In the very  beginning of this interview, I as
ked you who was Naftali Salishitz, and then  I 
asked you who was Taddek. Now I ask you who 
then is Norman Salsitz at this point?

A: Well, Norman Salsitz is all 
of those things, all of those 
things. Now, if I speak about 
something, and if I want to say somethi
ng from my  hometown, Kolbushova, I alway -- I 
call it home. I am -- I was there 22 years, but 
I am in the United States 50 years, more 
than double, but still this -- even America is d e
ar to me, and I think -- I think the best -- 
biggest patriots America had -- has, are people -- newcomers, because we appreciate 

America. S o me people who are born in Amer
ica, they don™t appreciate America. We 
appreciate. And then, if -- if -- so I love Am
erica, but still, when I say home, I have my 
little town, this is my home. Taddek was when 
I survived, and to be
 -- why did I survive? 
I fought back. I didn™t surviv
e because I was standing there 
with my hands 
down when I 
was laying on th e floor, shot four
 times. And if I wouldn™t be able to grab my  revolver, 
and to kill them, I wouldn™t be 
alive, because they were -- t
oday I got a letter from one of 
the people from my town
 in -- a very nasty letter, a very
 anti-Semitic letter. She is the 
head of the culture and history department. 
She was a professor in university. A very 
anti-Semitic letter. And I answered her also avery strong letter. And then later she wrote 
to me, which I never answered, she said, ﬁWe
ll, I didn™t,ﬂ -- I accused her of being an ti-
Semitic, she said, ﬁBut I didn™t kill nob
ody, but you are a murderer.ﬂ Why am I 
murderer? Because I killed those two guys. So
 when I was laying on the floor, wounded 
four times, I should have l -- be there, and be
g them give me one mo re bullet, and finish 
me off. But because I protected 
myself, and my brother, and I 
shot them, so n-naturally I 
am a murderer. So -- 
so when  it comes Taddek, Taddek is somebody who refused to die. 

When it comes to Norman Sals
itz, Norman Salsitz is all of
 those things. Now, I am

living, I am in a free country , I can do anything I want. I never had anything bad from the 
government in the United St
ates. They  never did anything 
wrong to me, and I can speak 
up. If something is wrong, I open my  mouth.
 I have -- I have stories here is th at 
something happens in 
-- in -- in Hoboken, something happe
ns there, but I always spoke 
up, and I always could yell, and I always co
uld say what I want. Nobody said be -- be 
quiet because you are a Jew. Nobody yet. Th
ere were some people who have anti-Semitic 
remarks, but nobody yet told 
me [indecipherab le], nobody kicked  me because I am a Jew. 
And this is what America is. I can be what 
I am, and I am not afraid that somebody will 
say you cannot be this, you cannot be this
 because you somebody 
different. And this 
what I tell the children when 
I spoke to them. You should be
 on the watch, if some 
skinhead, or somebody comes to
 you, and will -- he will tell you a story th at this Black is 
not good, that this Oriental is
 not good, this Jew is not go
od. You should always answer, 
and you should always st
ay on guard, and then, we will not
 have a Holocaust in America. 
But if nobody will say it, who 
knows? There will be enou -- 
enough people, they will get 
bigger and bigger, and we could have prob
lems. So this the pe
ople -- the children 
understand. But being in  America I think is a 
privilege, and th e privilege is because I can 
be anything I want. I can be -- so long as I™m
 not against the law. 
The only th ing I cannot 
be is a president, because I was not born
 here. But otherw ise, I can be anything 
[indecipherable] capable, I can 
do it. Nobody can stop me. My da
ughter, she is a daughter 
of survivors, she is a lawyer. 
My son-in-law, he™s a third ge
neration, he™s my  son-in-law, 
he™s a assistant professor at Harvard. He™s acknowledged, he goes 
around all the world.

My grandchildren, I hope they  will be some
thing. They can do it here. Where we, being 
in Poland fo r thousand years -- see, I always 
-- I always was a Polish Jew. And this what 
I was hurt. I wanted to be a Jewish Pole. Be
ing a Jewish Pole it me ans I could be a Jew 
Protestant, I could be a Jew Chri
stian, a Jew cat -- a -- a -- a Jew Catholic, but I wanted to 
be a Jewish Pole, but no, I was a Polish Jew. 
And this is a big difference between a Polish 
Jew, and a Jewish Pole. And this what I co
uld never achieve in Poland. Like take for 
instance, in Italy. In Italy the Jews were treat
ed very well, and 80 percent of Jews in ta -- 
in Italy survived. There were not too many 
Jews in Italy, but as many there were, 80 
percent survived. Now you will 
ask, Mussolini was a partner with Hitler. Why? Because 
the Italian people said, ﬁWe don™t have Jews. 
We have Italians with a different religion.ﬂ 
This what they approved the Jew, a different
 religion. And th -- and again, later, when 
they had undergro unds, so th
ey asked th-the Italians from the underground, they said, 
ﬁWhy do you go and help the 
Jews?ﬂ They said, ﬁWhen we on
 the underground, we fight 
against Hitler. Everything what Hi
tler says, we are opposite. He says to kill the Jew, so 
we save them.ﬂ But in Poland, was different. 
In Poland, when he sa
id to kill the Jews, 
they said -- my wife had a boyfriend, he lo
ved her, and he was everything. He said, ﬁI 
hate the Germans, what they 
do with Poland, but one thing 
I have to  admire and thank 
them, that they got rid of the 
Jews for us.ﬂ And he was a Polis
h patriot. But this was very 
important, he got rid of the Jews. So this is
 the different America 
-- I say America is my 
country. See, when it comes th
e Fourth  of July , I hang out a flag. I am the only one on th e 
street to hang out the flag. And the reason why 
I hang out the flag, b
ecause in Poland, if I

didn™t hang out the flag, the police came, gave
 me a fin e. Here, nobody gets fined by the 
police, and because they 
don™t force me, I want to hang ou t a flag, because I think this is 
very important for me. 
Q: Was a privilege speaking with
 you, thank you very mu ch. 
A: Well. So I -- I s -- I -- I said wh
at I -- what I [inaudible] so I -- 
Q: No, it was -- it was -- thank you very much
 for speaking with us
. And this concludes 
the United States Holocaust Memorial
 interview with Norman Salsitz.
