Answer: You are good interviewer. Though you didn™
t -- you didn™t have much luck with Mr. 
Milosh. 
Question: Oh, I thought I 
did. You didn™t think so? 
A: Oh, he kind of was hesitant some times, you kn ow, to say some thing or
 not -- that was his 
fault, because  he was kind of --

Q: Yes. 
A: Margulis. 

Q: And that™s -- can you spell your last name? 

A: I™m not sure there -- what the ending is. 
It™s -- should be M-a-
r-g-u-l-i-s, or e-i-s. 
Q: Or e-i-s? 

A: I mean i-e-s -- 

Q: i-e-s, right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And your father™s name  was Benjamin? 

A: Benjami n, yeah. 

Q: And your mother, Tatana?  Wa s -- 

A: Tatiana. 

Q: Tatiana. 
A: Right. 
Q: And w -- had they -- they had been
 living in Moscow when you were born? 
A: At that time  when I was born, yes, mm-hm.  

Q: Yes. And they came from where? 

A: From Wa rsaw. 

Q: From Wa rsaw. 

A: Wa rsaw. Th -- I don™t know whether it was the be
ginning of the war, or that was a little bit 
later, and anyway they, for some  reason they we
nt to Moscow. And m- my mother™s what -- what 
she was doing, what she -- what she was, a -- an 
me dical person, and they allowed her to live in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
3 
 
Moscow, because at that time, under the Tsar, Jews
 were not a-allowed to live in Moscow, unless 
they were engineers, technicians and medical people. 
Q: Uh-huh. And what was your mother at the time?  

A: She was fercherka, which is a -- a -- more than
 registered nurse. I thin
k they have now this 
kind of people who work with the physicians, surg
eons and so on, and they™re very close to -- 
they didn™t graduate as -- 
as doctors, but they had --  
Q: They had a lot of training. 

A: Right, yeah. 

Q: And your father, what was he doing?  Do you know?   

A: No, I know that in Warsaw he ha
d the store, a haberdashery store. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I™m not sure. 

Q: What are your earliest -- I know you were 
only there for a few years, but do you have 
me mories from being in Moscow as a child? 

A: Well, one me mory which I am -- I am not so su
re it™s a really me mory, because I was four or 
ma ybe five years old, that I was running through 
a corridor in the apartment, and knocking at 
that -- one of the doors, wanted to get in a
nd crying, and somebody picked me  up. And I -- later 
on I told my mother and she said, well you descri
bed this corridor, though
 I -- it was true, was 
long corridor, but I don™t reme mber the rest.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That™s all, you know. It™s the very ear
ly childhood, if I really reme mber that. 
Q: Right, right. Do you reme mber the chaos of Moscow at the time of the revolution? 

A: No, I don™t think I -- I re-reme mbe r that, 
but later on I -- I m -- read and heard -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
4 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- that it was a very dange
rous street. You shouldn™t wa
lk around. There is a very good book 
ab-about what was going on in Moscow at that 
time , by Jeromski, who was a writer, and -- and 
he wrote about the son and -- and -- and father 
who met ge -- ac -- accident ally that they were 
working together in a -- some  kind of labor, sl
ave labor or  whatever. 
It wa sn™t slave labor 
because they were free to go. And she -- this 
guy who had gi-given him a place to live, told 
them, don™t wander too much around Moscow, it™s 
a very dangerous place. And it was. It was 
shooting innocent people [indecipherable] some
body brought out to uncover their name , and -- 
and they were just shoot
ing around the city, yeah. 
Q: Now, I understand that your father left 
Moscow to -- to try to get to Odessa. 
A: Right. 

Q: Do you re -- do -- did you reme mber his leaving? 

A: No, not at all. 
Q: No. 
A: No, I don™t.  

Q: And wha t  were you told -- I understand later that you were told that he was -- he went to 

Odessa for -- 

A: He was trying to get to Odessa, I don™t know
 how, what and how, because trains were not 
riding th -- you know, there was no schedules or 
anything, just a train co
me s in the station and 
you get in and you ask where -- where 
is it going. It -- it was a comp
lete chaos and he was trying 
to get to Odessa, but my mother™s brother 
said that -- that  th
ey never seen him.  
Q: Uh-huh. And so do you think that he left in 1918 or 1917, do you have any idea? 

A: I think it probably -- se
 -- eight -- si -- 17 or 18. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
5 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I -- I have no idea, I can™t say that. 

Q: And then how long did you stay in Moscow after he had left, do you -- 

A: I think my mother decided to go back to
 Wa rsaw and she was looking for a way no -- down 
there. She probably found out about 
echelon. It used to be called echelon, this train. This was set 
up by -- I don™t know, it ma -- it mus t  be later th
an ™18, because when Poland regained their 
status as -- as a -- as a countr
y, they decided to help the Polish
 people to come  back. And if you -
- if you fi -- if you ever were a 
citizen of Poland, you could apply and look for a -- for a s -- town 
where it will stop. So probably my mother did that
, find out where -- where it is. But before that, 
we went to Krasnodar, which is a town close to
 Caucasian mountains, wh
ere my gr andparents on 
ma  -- my mother™s side lived. And we went
 there and stayed, I d -- don™t know how long. 

Q: Wa s that nice for you to be there? 

A: I think it was nice, yes, it was v-very nice 
house with the verandas [i
ndecipherable] and -- and 
there was a huge tree where our 
neighbor ma de for children to cl
imb in, and there was a little 
house there, but they didn™t let me  go. I don™t kno
w, maybe once I was there, but was -- it was a 
joyful time. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And my grandfatherpassed atthe 
time and we started our way back -- 
Q: To Wa rsaw. 

A: -- to Warsaw. 

Q: And your sister was born when? 

A: She was born in Wa rsaw in 1910. 

Q: So before your parents left for -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
6 
 
A: Right, oh yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- for Moscow, obviously, right.Were you close with your sister? 

A: Oh yes, very much. Well, you know how siblings are. 

Q: Right. And you were six years younger -- 

A: Right, yeah. 

Q: -- right, so it™s a big -- it™s a -- 

A: Well, this is later year s, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: So -- 

Q: So you went to Wa rsaw. 

A: Yes, we went to Wa rsaw by echelon, a trai
n which stopped at Rostov. Rostov on -- on Don, 

which is dona in Polish, whatev
er. I keep forget -- Dniep -- no. I keep forgetting -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- the name of it in th -- in Engl ish. 
Q: What is it in Polish? 

A: The Dnieper. 

Q: The Dnieper, yeah. 

A: Right. And we had to cross the -- the se
a from Odessa to Rostov, and the only thing I 
reme mber, I was sick on th -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- on this -- on the trip
, yeah, that™s all I reme mber [indecipherable] 
Q: And wha t  are you, about fi
ve or six at this point? 

A: No, I probably was six or seven, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
7 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And whe n we came t o Poland I -- I didn™t speak Polish yet, and I reme mber later -- later 

[indecipherable] in -- in school 
that was a poli -- teacher of Polish, and he remi nded me all the 

time that I am -- that I am putting the -- the senten
ces in a way Russians put it. And -- and so it 
was kind of a long way. So we cou -- we came to Warsaw in ™22, I think. ™22 [indecipherable], 

and I went to school, and the sc
hool was co-educational, which wa
s a big, big st-step forward. 
Q: What was it called? 

A: Co-educational. 

Q: Co-educational, oh. 

A: Right, right. Boys
 and girls together. 

Q: Right. 

A: Unthinkable. And we were there for a couple of years. 

Q: Was this a privat e school? 
A: It was a private school, yeah. 
Q: So your mother had a fair amount 
of money to be able to do that? 
A: No, she didn™t, but she star
ted to work, and I -- I really
 don™t -- I don™t know how s he 
ma naged, ye ah. 

Q: Mm-hm. And your sister went 
to that same  school as well? 
A: Right, uh-huh. 

Q: And were you -- you -- so you knew Polish fl
uently?  You grew up knowing [indecipherable] 
A: Right, and forget completely Russian. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
8 
 
A: I know some times when they speak, I -- I hear
 some thing I understand, but I forgot once the -
- I think your losing lang
uage is very easy. 
Q: Very easy. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. And at home you spoke Polish, so w-
wa s there Yiddish spoken at home at all? 
A: No. 

Q: Nothing. 

A: No, that was unre ligious house, and --  

Q: Totally non-religious. So did you learn abou
t Judaism at all, or [indecipherable] mu ch? 
A: Well, I knew that I -- I -- th
at I am Jewish, but that™s all. 
It™s a [indecipherable] up to -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- yeah, up to -- up to here. I tried to 
go to synagogue but just
 couldn™t catch it. 
Q: Right. And does -- we re you in
 a school that was mi xed with
 Jewish students as well as 
Christian students -- 

A: Right.  

Q: -- Catholic students? 

A: Yeah, yeah, ri -- oh yes, yes. There were 
Catholic, say special classes for Catholics, and 
special classe s for Jews. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. But I mostly didn™t go. 

Q: You just left school. A
nd they didn™t say anything? 
A: No, nothing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
9 
 
Q: And how were the relations between the Jewi
sh students at -- you, and 
the Catholic students, 
were they -- 
A: Very good. 

Q: That was good? 

A: Very good, yeah. 

Q: So you didn™t feel -- 

A: No -- 

Q: -- anti-Semitism? 

A: -- not at all, not at all. Th
at what I am saying, that I myself never felt anti-Semitism, but it 
used to be -- used to be for awhile in late 30
™s that the national part
y came to -- to power, and 
students in the university dema nded a diff -- different
 places for -- for Jews to
 sit. But I -- I don™t 
think it ever came th-through this
. There were a lot of fights betw
een s-students in the -- at the 
university, mm-hm. 
Q: But before we get to the university years, 
tell me  a little bit about gr owing up with a single 
mother, obviously, which I don™t know that wasn
™t so typical at the time. It was -- 
A: No, it wasn™t, and well, we had the -- a helper. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And she was helping with, y -- you know, the 
thing -- the house and k
eeping the house clean 
and -- and cooking, some cooking and my mother wa
s away working. It wasn™t hard, no, because 
my mother was a very loving mother. 

Q: What was she like? 

A: She was lovely. I am sorry I didn™t bring this photo. 

Q: We  can show the photos later. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
10 
 
A: Right. 
Q: Yes.  

A: And so it wasn™t harsh. I mean, we were 
not rich or anything, you know, that was far from 
there. But we  were get -- getting along fine. A
nd my grandmother -- I slept in the same  room 
with my grandmother, and she collapsed and died of probably a heart attack. 

Q: And whe n was that?  That was later? 

A: That was probably late 20™s,
 I don™t reme mber  exactly, no. 
Q: So your grandmother, who you -- who had lost her husband in Odessa, came with you to -- 

A: Right. 

Q: I see. 

A: She did, uh-huh. So -- 

Q: Did you like school? 

A: I did and I didn™t. You know how it is with -- 
later on I went to another school, and after that I 
went still to another school, Po
lish schools. And the last one I we
nt was in different part of 
Warsaw, and it was kind of funny because the sc
hool was on a -- a hi gh building, that was high 
probably at that time , it was nine floors or so
me thing like that, and the school was on eight and 
nine floor. And we had a differe
nt entrance because the tena
nts who lived in -- in the -- 
dema nded that that will ha -- but  some ti me s we got out and come  
down the stairs of the tenants 
and rang the -- the -- yeah, what is it? 

Q: Ring the bell? 

A: Ring the bell, yeah. And one of the rang the be
ll was later on my very close friend here. That 

was her mot her who opened the door, and we were already down. 

Q: And why were you moving to so ma ny school
s?  Why were you going to so ma ny s c hools? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
11 
 
A: We ll, the second school I went from [indeci
pherable] it was a science school more -- more. 
And th-thatwas more mathematical,physical, 
you know, and physics and so on and I wasn™t 
doing too well. I mean, I was 
not very interested in. 
Q: In science? 
A: But the -- the next school was me r  -- mor -- 
more ada -- I have adapted much better, yeah. 
Q: Did you have very close friends when you we
re growing up, before you went to university? 
A: Yes, well, I -- I can™t recall,
 you know, any -- any really clos
e friends, but I™m di -- you know, 
just colleagues, yeah. And -- 

Q: Did you go to the movies? 

A: And go -- we were -- yeah, yes, we went to
 the movies, but had to take off my ar -- 
[indecipherable] kind of a [indeciphe
rable] with the -- with the -- 
some thing on it, so we had to 
take this off and go to the movies. Some tim
es we were caught that we shouldn™t go. 
Q: You me a n, you were s -- you were going [indecipherable] 
A: We  were not allowed, yeah, to go in, yeah. 
Q: Really?  Why?  

A: We ll, because of the age, you know. We  want ed 
to see the movies with Greta Garbo and si -- 
all those big -- and it was not allowed for a -- 

Q: Why, because these were romantic movies, 
and you were supposed to be too -- you were too 
young? 

A: Right, yeah. 

Q: But you went and you liked them? 

A: Yeah, very much, of course. 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
12 
 
A: And I collected the -- they ha
d the postcard, they have the pos
tcards of the [indecipherable] 
movie. 
Q: And you collected those? 

A: And I collected them. 

Q: Movies were very 
popular, weren™t they? 
A: Oh yes, very much, very much. 

Q: And did you listen to radio? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And wha t  was -- what was that like?  What were 
-- was it a lot of news, or music or what was 
that like?   

A: It was wa -- one and the other, a lot of news 
and then mus i c, yeah. It™s where we learned all 
this bombing comi ng, you know, that was not [ind
ecipherable] it was, you know, when the war 

started, yeah. 
Q: I see. Did you ever hear Janusz Korczak on the radio? 
A: No, I didn™t, but I knew about his -- about
 his school and his ch
ildren, yes. No -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- I never heard him on the radio. Was he on the radio? 

Q: I gather he was. 

A: He was? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Oh. 

Q: But it -- it ma y have been earlier, or 
if it was -- whatever r
eason, you didn™t listen.  
A: Right, yeah. We ll, I was busy, 
of course, with school and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
13 
 
Q: And how did you decide to go and study journalism?  Wh y was that -- 
A: Well, I -- I used to like to write stories and 
things, but didn™t come  out anything out of it. I 
would still write, but -- 

Q: So when did you -- 

A: -- it™s -- it™s in the dr awer. 

Q: It™s in the drawers -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- not ka -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So when did you start university? 

A: Let™s see, 30 -- yeah, I ma -- ma -- ma
turate in ™33 -- ™34 -- ™35 probably, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. And you we nt for how long, a couple of years? 

A: Couple of years. 
Q: And did you get the degree? 
A: No, I didn™t. 

Q: You didn™t? 

A: I didn™t. It was just
 a -- the war just  -- 
Q: Started in ™39. 

A: -- you know, yeah. 

Q: And how ma ny years would you have -- 

A: And but I was also working as 
a -- as a secretary in meantime. 

Q: So does that mean you were going 
part time to school?  [indecipherable] 
A: No, no, I was going full time , but I was still 
a -- a secretary for the afternoon, so -- yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
14 
 
Q: So how ma ny year -- if you had completed, how 
ma ny ye ars would it have taken to complete 
the degree?  

A: Four years. 

Q: Four years. 

A: Right. 

Q: And this is when you me t Stefan Koper, yes? 

A: Yes, I me t him at the -- some  kind of -- he 
was comi ng to school just -- he -- he was already a 
journalist. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But he was comi ng to school, to some  mee
tings you know, [indecipherable] and so on, and so 
I  me t  h i m t h e r e .   

Q: So did you become  fri e nds then?  [indecipherable] 

A: No, not really, no. He invited me  to a j
ournalism b-ball, and not
 any close friend, no. 
Q: Uh-huh. Okay. 

A: But we knew each other. 

Q: But you knew each ot her. 

A: Yeah, uh-huh. 

Q: Now, we re you in a gr oup of people that knew each other so you saw each other -- 

A: Yeah, it was a group, mm-hm, right. 

Q: So did you see each ot her with some  regularity? 

A: No -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- not especially, no. No, when they -- when 
the meeting was held, and then I was there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
15 
 
Q: And what was it like in the university at th
is time, because the Nazis ha d taken over Germany 
in ™33 [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, but this has nothing to do with -- w
ith Poland, but there was a fertile ground for anti-

Se mitism there. There is no -- no doubt about it. 

Q: So did you start feeling some
what fearful or apprehensive? 
A: No, I didn™t, I -- I had no id
ea that -- you know, Polish people ne
ver showed it, exactly. There 
were newspapers on one side, and --
 and on the other side, it™s -- it
 was a democracy still, but the 
-- the na tional [indecipherable] there was [indeciphe
rable] and str -- there were several factions, 
and the -- they were writing whatever they have in their mi nd, you know -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- it was a de-democratic [indecipherable]. Bu
t it -- it was a -- I think it
 was a fertile place to 
start some -- some of Hitler™s ideas. 

Q: Wh -- when you were going to school, were you aske
d to sit in the back, or told to sit in the 
back? 

A: Oh no, no, no, no. 

Q: It didn™t happen? 

A: No, never happened, no. What was addressing this
, it was a -- in ™36 or seven, there was some  
fi ght at the university. The -- the nationalists were
 against the --  the liber
al ones, and they were 
just fighting among the mselves and they wanted to
 have -- do some  different -- different places 
to sit down. But I don™t think it ever came to be.  

Q: And you were at which university? 

A: Wa rsaw University. 

Q: Wa rsaw University. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
16 
 
A: But the -- the jour nalism was on a different pl
ace, not the -- not that 
the -- the building of 
university. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And your sister was studying 
at Warsaw University also? 
A: She did, yeah. 

Q: In di -- in journalism or not? 

A: I don™t reme mber what 
she was taking in there. 
Q: Uh-huh. And you we re livi
ng at home , both of you? 
A: At home , yeah, both of us. 

Q: Yes, and your mother is, of
 course, continuing to work. 
A: Right, yeah. 

Q: So, in 1939, when the Germans attack
ed Poland, is this a big surprise? 
A: Not such a big surprise, but the -- well, th
e -- the government was te
lling us absolutely 
some thing entirely different. That we™re strong an
d -- and that they have tanks ma de of, I don™t 
know, cartons or whatever. I-It wa
s unbelievable. We just couldn™
t believe that -- that™s comi ng. 
And it came, first of September, 1939, and we h
eard the bombing comi ng closer and closer. And 
then it didn™t take long. But of course, Wa rs
aw was fighting through for another 20 days or 

something like that. And then they came -- th
ey came ma rching the ma in street of Wa rsaw. 
Q: And you reme mber that. 

A: Right. But before that it was a kind of a -- a -- 
a week or 10 days that they were free, the -- 
and I reme mber with my sister that we  were wa lking in Wa rsaw ruined 
-- n-not ruined the way it 
was ruined after the uprising, but it -- it was 
pretty badly dama ged, and one thing I remember 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
17 
 
very well, it™s -- it™s a dead 
horse on the street, you know. Some  
-- there were no dead people, so 
I saw the -- the horse there. 
Q: Just the horse.  

A: And -- 

Q: That mus t  have been a big shock 
walking around under those circumstances.  
A: Oh yeah, it was, but it was quiet, and pe
 -- people were shoot -- just going around, not 
knowing what™s going to come . A
nd then they -- they get -- got 
in, and they ma rched in. The -- 
in this thoroughfare of Warsaw. 

Q: And did you go and look, or could you see it
 from your apartment [indecipherable]  
A: No, no, nobody came out. 

Q: Nobody came out. 

A: Nobody, no, they were empty street.  

Q: Mm. 
A: Yes. So that was kind of a quiet two mont
hs, and everybody was waiting for orders -- what is

Q: Posters? 
A: Posters, posters, that™s righ
t. That there is a typhus, and th
at they going to change the -- 
Warsaw, and the Jews ha ve to come  out and liveat certain places. They di dn™t sa y exactly where, 

but later on they did say, and w-
we thought, you know, that we will just stay at home, but we 
didn™t. We  were told to move inside 
the ghett -- the ghetto didn™t exist -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- actually, at the time. And the wall di dn™t 
go up until we were already inside. And the wall 
usually was running through the half
 of the street. So we were
 looking for some thing and we 
couldn™t find anyone. Then my -- our dentist, who 
lived inside of this perime ter where -- where 
we -- we could live too, offered us living quarters, so we decided to move  there. It was a 

[indecipherable] complete [indecipherable]. It 
was 1940 October. And we moved wha t ever we 
could, just by hand, and by a little cart wh
ich my -- my d -- my daughter™s husband found 
some where. 
Q: You me a n your sister™s husband. 
A: My -- my  sister, what 
-- what™d I say, daughter?   

Q: You said -- yeah. 

A: I did -- never had a daughter. So, 
see how mi xed up I am?  Okay. We ll -- 
Q: Let me  a s k you some thing. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: Are there rumors going around?  What are peopl
e saying to each other w-with this -- wi -- 
A: Just rumors. Rumors  and posters, that™s all.  

Q: Now, Chernyokov is ma de 
head of the Jewish -- 
A: Right, yeah -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
19 
 
Q: -- council in October, right? 
A: -- he was, uh-huh, right. 

Q: And wha t  did you think of that?   

A: We ll, we thought it™s proba
bly wonderful, but we didn™t kn
ow what™s going on. I had the -- 
the first -- my ausweiss, which is a kind of a pa
per which shows that you are not ready for -- for 
deportation. It was from -- from Jude nrat, yea
h. And because the f -- a friend of mi ne  -- my 
friend™s father belonged to the 
-- to the [indecipherable], and 
so I got this ausweiss, which 
nothing was worth. I didn™t work there. 

Q: That was in the begi nning?  

A: That was in the beginning. 

Q: And wha t  was his name ?  Your friend™s father™s name ? 

A: Jelinski, right. 

Q: And he was on the council with Chernyokov? 
A: Right. 
Q: Right. So was -- when you moved into th
e place, what wa s it -- what was it like? 
A: We ll, we moved into this dentist, Anika wa
s her name , and she let us a very large living 
room, and facilities -- I mean in
 th -- in the kitchen, and then a 
very tiny room for my sister and 
her husband. And my mother le -- 
wasn™t well at -- all of a s
udden, because her first -- her first 
incident or ac -- or accident, happened when th
ey bombarded Warsaw, and we were told by the -
- that we should hide behind -- inside of the houses
, or inside of the gates of the houses. And she 
did that, and this other -- ar
g -- other group, too, and she saw 
a little who wa s crying, and she 
gave her a candy. And some body rema rk, you s houldn™
t do that, cause there™s spies now, you™re 

not supposed to do it. And before she knew, a po
liceman came in and I -- 
I nof -- not arrested 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
20 
 
her, but took her to -- to a 
-- the o -- office -- police office a
nd charged her with some thing, but 
they -- he let her go. She was very upset about 
it. And since then she 
wasn™t very well.  
Q: Wa s this the Jewish police who picked her up? 
A: Pardon?  

Q: Jewish police who picked her up, or the -- 

A: There wasn™t any Je wish police at that time -- 

Q: At that time .  

A: -- no. The f -- the Judenrat started to form po- police and so on -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- on -- on dema nd from Gestapo and Germans. 

Q: And did you think your mother was getting 
depressed, or she was getting physically ill? 
A: Oh she -- no, she -- no, she wasn™t well 
physically, and then depressed also, yeah. 
Q: So how old would she have been by -- around this time, do you think, about? 
A: How bo -- how what? 
Q: How old do you think your mother was? 

A: I don™t know. Probably over 50, yeah. 

Q: Over 50. 

A: 50, yeah, or 56, I don™t know. 

Q: And how was your grandmother at this time? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: No. 

Q: Does your sister get a -- get a special 
pass as we ll as you, when you [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
21 
 
A: Yes, she did, yeah, from Judenrat, yeah. 
Q: But you™re not working, cause there™s -- th
ere are no workshops set up, there™s nothing -- 
A: No -- 

Q: -- set up. 

A: -- there™s nothing to do there. It wa
s just because I knew the people there. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. Well, actually, you know what Germa ns were
 doing, they were preparing us for all this 
what was comi ng, by de pressing us, 
that we are much less regular 
people than -- 
then the -- the 
other folks. 

Q: Did it work? 

A: Yeah. I -- the -- that  we are -- 

Q: Not as good. 

A: -- not as good as -- as German pe ople. 
Q: And how did that ma ke you feel? 
A: Terrible, terrible. I -- at th
is time  in 40™s, and early ™41, I used to go outside to our friends 
who never moved from their places, counting proba
bly on the -- the -- that
 -- that they didn't 
know [indecipherable] leaving, or they -- they kn
ew, but they didn™t disclose that. And they 
prevailed until the uprising.  

Q: Really? 

A: I™m talking about not the uprising in ghetto -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- I™m talking about the German uprising -- 

Q: The Polish uprising in ™44. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
22 
 
A: -- right, right. 
Q: And you were able to go in and out 
of the ghetto before [indecipherable] 
A: Yes, yes, there were possibili
ty and I -- I went several times. 
Just [indecipherable] took off the 
-- the band on -- on your right hand and -- and went
 and it was won -- wonderful. It™s a feeling 
like some thing very heavy [indecipherable]. 

Q: Wa s it dangerous for you to leave? 

A: Not at thi -- 

Q: You -- 

A: -- this time, no. 

Q: No. 

A: No.  

Q: But you had a -- 

A: Unless a -- I would -- I don™t 
know, I probably didn™t look very
 much Jewish, or something. I 
didn™t have any problem. But it wa 
-- didn™t last very long, cause they
 closed this -- this courts. 
These were courts. 

Q: Courts?  [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah. C-o-u-r-t. 

Q: C-o-u-r-t. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yes.  

A: C-o-u-r-t. 

Q: So, as soon as you moved into this area th
at then became the -- the ghetto, the walled-in 
ghetto, were you put -- you had to put on an armband -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
23 
 
A: Right, mm-hm. 
Q: And it was -- what wa s the color, do you reme mber? 

A: White with blue, the David -- 

Q: So this must have been also extrem
ely strange for you, and for everybody else.  
A: I don™t know. But you know, there was so ma ny th
ings around us which were terrible. First of 
all, the change of the livi
ng quarters. The -- the -- the su
rrounding, and you know, some body™s 
else house you live, and tha -- there was a l
ack of food. Ther e was a -- our housekeeper, who 
used to come to our regular pl ace where we used to live, and she brought some food from -- from 

reich. Reich was -- was anything which is -- wh
ich Germans occupied, it 
was called reich, r-e-i-
c-h. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they were o-occupied [indecipherable] 
and -- and they -- it was m-more contact with 
other people, and here all of a 
sudden we™re cut off of everything. 
And there was nothing to -- to 
live by. 

Q: So this was the least of 
it, having the armband, it was not 
-- was not as [indecipherable] 
A: The armb and -- the armband worked only in --
 in the ghetto. When yo
u go out -- you couldn™t 
go out with your armband. Out 
of the ghetto you couldn™t go.  
Q: Did -- did things change really immediatel
y when you moved, so that there was much less 
food, water, electricity -- 

A: No wa -- there was water. 

Q: There was water? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
24 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, for a long time, mm- h m. But fo
od, yes, there were -- you know, the little boys 
were smuggling bread and all kinds of food. But 
when you paid the [indecipherable] which was 
the German, later on in the day, in --
 lots of food came into ghetto by -- 
Q: They smuggled it. 

A: You know, by -- yeah, mm-hm.  

Q: And then, what were they [indecipherable] 

A: Everything has been smuggled, yeah. 

Q: And they would sell it sort of
 like a black ma rket, they would 
sell it so they could get -- 
A: Yes, expensive, yeah.  

Q: But you weren™t working, your mother wa
sn™t working, so how did you get food? 
A: We ll, we ha -- we had some  money, and I -- wi  
-- we sold out a lot of th -- tabl e sel -- silver 
and so on when we still were outsi
de there, the ghetto, I went to 
-- to a market and sold out for 

whatever, flo-flour or what
 i s  - -  oi l  or  wha t e v er . 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And how did you bring in the stuff that you bought? 

A: Well, it wasn™t ghetto at the time. 

Q: Uh-huh, so it was still [indecipherable] 

A: No, it was before, yeah. 

Q: -- that was alright. Before the wall was put up. 

A: Right, yeah. 

Q: And did you go see your friends when you went out? 

A: Yes, I went to my friends, I went to a friend very far away. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
25 
 
Q: And did they suggest -- 
A: We ll, they -- they he lped us a little bit, as
 muc h as they could, but 
nottoo much. We actually 
sold out everything before we went to
 ghetto, and we just lived day by day.  
Q: Did you think when you left the ghetto, in order 
to sell out stuff, that at some  point ma ybe you 
should [indecipherable] 

A: I didn™t go out of the ghetto to sell. 

Q: I don™t -- I know [indeciphe
rable] yes, when you -- 
A: That was before that, yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- when you moved into the area that became the ghetto. 

A: Right. 

Q: Did you ever think of stayi
ng outside of that area, or -- 
A: We ll, yes I did, but I didn't see 
any possibility. My sist
er could go to Br azil before we went to 
ghetto, when some body gave her papers. 
Q: Really? 
A: And -- but she didn™t. It -- it wasn™t that -- it
 wasn™t yet so strong feel
ing that we can™t get -- 
that we can™t get through, you know
, in -- in a few months, in a year. We  got this bullet -- 
bulletin, a Polish bulletin that it 
will not last long an-and so
 on, and you know, this kind of 
things. But the real break-out was the Stalingr
ad offensive and that was much, much l a ter. 
Q: So tell -- let™s go back. When -- when the --
 when the wall is built, do you now have this 
feeling of what -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- this is not going to 
end so soon. Some thing -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
26 
 
A: Right, of course. And we lived with this de
ntist friend and she had her windows turned into 
the place where they checking it out, the ghett
o, and I looked what was go -- what™s going on. 
You know they s -- they were b
eating the small children with [i
ndecipherable] and cutting the 
Jewish Hassidim, the beards, and laughing 
[indecipherable] all 
-- was right ther e. 
Q: So it was just getting worse and worse? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you now begin to see dead
 bodies, or was that later? 
A: Dead body was -- was later. 

Q: It was later. 

A: Yeah. Because they ev -- every -- every comm
unity, ev -- Je wish community which were left 
over, they were comi ng to Warsaw. It started to
 be , you know, not just wars -- Wa rsaw citizens, 
but everybody else. And from Ger many and -- and even from abroad, yeah. 

Q: So there™s a huge number of people who come  into a very, very small -- 
A: Place, yeah. 
Q: -- area. There™s almost 400,000 people -- 

A: Right. 

Q: [indecipherable] become s the ghetto. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So this must have been awful. 

A: Awful. I n --  

Q: Really chaotic -- 

A: -- in living quarters, yes. 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
27 
 
A: The typhus really began at that time. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: I had typhus, too. 

Q: You did? 

A: Yes. It was in ™42, in -- in wint er and all of
 a sudden I became very ill, and it -- there was a -- 
there wasn™t an -- even doctors available, but a 
friend doctor came  and gave me some whatever. I 
went through it with a very high fever, and if 
it --  it will become  me
ningitis after the fever 
become s really high. But I -- 

Q: But you got through it. So you were living with
 your mother, your grandmother, your sister, 
and your brother-in-law? 

A: No, grandmother wa-wasn™t alive. 

Q: Your grandmother was gone. 

A: Yeah. Grandmother was gone yeah, that was long time before. 
Q: Before you moved? 
A: Before we moved, ye ah. 

Q: I see. 

A: Oh, muc h before we moved. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah, yeah. She lived until, I don™t know, ™36 or seven yeah. 

Q: ™36 -- ™36. And is your brother-in-law workin
g, your sister working, 
or is no one working? 
A: We ll, he was working. We  -- i --
 you can™t -- you can™t say that -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- he was working. There was no wor
kplace as [indecipherable] can imagine. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
28 
 
Q: Right. 
A: There was, you know, some  kind of a tradi
ng. You -- you had this a
nd I give you that and 
then you give  me  I don™t know what, flour or -- or
 macaroni or whatever and -- and so on. Or 
you have contact with the outside, meaning th
e Polish, which I had, and -- and could sell 
some thing to friends and they will give you any 
money. But that was all in
 the beginning, in the 
beginning of the ghetto. 

Q: Right. And do you reme mber these self
-help organizations, house committees around 
War s aw?  

A: As far as I reme mber, it didn™t 
-- it had nothing to do with me .  
Q: So did y -- you didn't know about s -- any soup kitchens, or -- 

A: We ll, they were organized, all those ki
nd of things, but I was out of the area. 
Q: You were out of that. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: I see. And what about -- I do know that there 
were lots of -- there were lots of cultural 
activities, some 
[indecipherable] 
A: Yes, there was, mm- hm. I was once only -- 

Q: Once? 

A: -- in a -- in some kind of a -- a garde
n, you know, put up as a -- as a kind of a café or 
whatever. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Yeah. But it was only once. And th -- well, a lo
t of it is in -- pianist 
is a -- di-did you read 
that?  Yeah, well, he has a -- a different approach 
to that, yeah, but I didn
™t know. We ll, it was -- 
you know, it was for people who really ma de mo ne
y, and some  did. And some  had c ontact with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
29 
 
the Gestapo. They thought this will help them to 
-- to get out of the deportation. But a-at the last 
time, it did not. 
Q: Mm. So as -- let™s talk between 1940, in 
November, whe n -- when the ghetto -- when the 
ghetto really become s enclosed, 
until before the deportations, wh
at do you begin to think about 
the Judenrat at this time ?  Do you -- are you 
-- do you think they™re do
ing a good job?  Are you 
angry with them?  Do you wonder what™s -- 

A: About Judenrat? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: We ll, it di -- you know, they -- they just couldn
™t do much. They were told one day they have 
to -- to send 10,000 Jewish me n for work. A
nd where would they find those 10,00 Jews? 
Q: Right. 

A: And it would -- was a -- a very bad job, I should say.  

Q: Yes. 
A: Yeah, they -- they couldn™t come  out of it right
. And once they were arrested, all of them, and 
there was a saying all over the gh
etto that some thing bad is comi
ng, and they were -- and they let 
them out in a couple of days. So we didn't know
 much about it, what was going on. We knew the 
[indecipherable] comma ndo, which was in later year
s used to get people out of the houses, and 
march the m to Umschlagplatz. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: That was a special unit, special German un
it. And they -- they had also Lithuanians, 
Ukrainians, and -- and there -- that
™s what they help us, and dogs. 
Q: And dogs. And did you think that 
the Judenrat had kind of a speci
al privileges, that they got 
more food, or they were more -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
30 
 
A: Maybe they had easier to get 
food, but I don™t think they were ever paid or -- or anything. I -- 
I have no i -- 
Q: [indecipherable] didn™t know -- 

A: -- yeah, right. 

Q: Right. 

A: I -- I -- I knew only -- the demands were ve
ry well known, that they need more and more 
people t-to work. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. And they -- the Judenr
at couldn™t handle it, it -- it 
was too -- too difficult to get 10,000 
people to work one day, it was -- 

Q: Did you hear things about an underground m
oveme nt, or the political move me nts in the 

ghetto? 

A: Very late, yes I had, because my -- my daught -- my sister husband, chi -- joined them for 
awhi -- as much as I know before I left ghetto.  
Q: Wa s involved. 

A: Wa s involved. 

Q: And do you know with what group he was involved? 

A: No, I don™t, no. There were very -- as -- as 
far as I know, there were very few who really took 

part in the ghetto uprising and it was absolutely
 unbelievable what they have done. In the first 
day of the uprising, the Germans pu
lled out, it wa s such a strong --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- but of course later on it™s -- it
™s [indecipherable] it was tragic.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
31 
 
Q: Right. But did you -- be-before the deportatio
ns, did you know that th
ere were political 
groups talking about what they should do, or
 what they were capable of doing? 
A: Yeah, well, not much, not much. That 
it -- it wa s chaotic at first, you know? 
Q: Right. 
A: But later on when they decided 
to -- to -- to do that, th-there
 was smuggling of -- of weapons 
and I heard about it, I knew that exists. 

Q: Right. But that was not some thing that you we re involved with? 

A: No. 

Q: When you were outside, di -- were th -- the 
puli -- the Catholics ta
lking about underground or 
not?  

A: Oh yes, yes, I heard through Stefan, uh-huh. 

Q: And whe n did -- did -- when did you see Stef
an for the first time after the occupation?  Do you 
r e me mb e r ?  
A: I came out through the courts -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- and I walked the -- the ma in street of Wa
rsaw, [indecipherable] Koska, and I s -- I seen 
him, but I didn't approach him. It was too da
ngerous at that time. But he saw me , and he 

approached me , and we went for coffee and he to
ld me about his -- his marching o -- o -- the -- 
you know, because there were orders and six or seve
n September from radio, that all able me n to 
carry weapons should go out toward the east. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And he and his colleagues left. And that wa
s a walking march, cause they didn™t have any 
cars, nothing -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
32 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- right, yeah. It was some
thing some body [indecipherable]. And he went to Lvov, which is 
Lviv now. [indecipherable]. And they found out th
ere is no -- no army, nothing. So they turned 
around and heard that Warsaw is
 completely demolished. And so they came back and he found 
out that he has to move out of th -- of his apar
tment where he lived, caus
e this part of Warsaw 
was given to Gestapo and other officers. 

Q: Uh-huh. So what was he -- when you 
me t him, was he involved with -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- the underground at this time? 

A: Yeah, at -- at first he was -- he
 opened a little store or  whatev
er in books, but he didn™t -- he 
didn™t succeed. So he -- he got -- 
he got -- he had the friend in 
the taxation departme nt and she 
gave him a ausweiss to go to ghetto. And [indeciphe
rable] the people with taxes. Of course, he 
didn™t -- there wasn™t anyone to 
whom he can give the taxes. 
Q: So he was supposed to -- 
there were tax collectors? 
A: Right. 

Q: Right?  There were also people collecting money fo
r gas, for electricity, as far as I understand 

it.  

A: I think so, but I 
don™t -- don™t re
call that. 
Q: So he was supposed to collect taxes for the Polish governme nt?  

A: He was supposed to -- yeah, mm- h m, right. 

Q: And did he ever s -- 

A: Not Polish governme nt -- 

Q: [indecipherable] whatever  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
33 
 
A: -- yeah, yeah, right. 
Q: Was -- did he succeed? 

A: No, he didn™t. He -- he just tried to get 
to the certain places, a
nd there was nobody, or they 
changed their address, or they not living any more
, yeah. So that was his 
job, and that™s why he 
got the ausweiss, which let him go into the -- 

Q: Go in and out. 

A: -- yeah. So he visited his fr
iends, his Jewish friends, and he 
dow -- he visited us too, and he 
brought sardines from Portugal, and soap. 

Q: And soap. 

A: Which was a very important thing. 
Kind of a -- is kind of a large -- 
Q: Large soap? 

A: Is kind -- yeah.  

Q: So how often did he come  into the ghetto, do you reme mbe r? 
A: We ll, oh once a week or -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- some thing, yeah. 

Q: So you would see him once a week? 

A: Right. And he -- he told me  fi
nally in October -- think it was Oc
tober, ™42 or some  -- that his 
ausweiss is running out and if I want to co
me out to his apartment, I a m welcome. 
Q: And wha t  did you think? 

A: I didn't think anything about it. Well, you know, 
it -- it -- well, going back it
™s so difficult. It™s 
so difficult to -- to know what I™d been thinki ng each
 time , a fter each catastrophe. It -- it™s very 
hard to thi -- ma ybe I didn't  think at all. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
34 
 
Q: Maybe you just passed it by. 
A: Right. 

Q: [indecipherable] he said it 
-- uh-huh. We re you becomi ng close 
friends at this point, were you 
be -- o-or not? 

A: W- We  were -- we were friends, yeah. 

Q: You were friends. 

A: Or re -- I know -- I knew some
 people who lived with him --  
Q: Yes. 

A: -- and that was the connection, it was -- he 
-- he had a -- a [i
ndecipherable] who was 
Finkelstein actually. And they had the an-antique 
store in Warsaw -- I mean, before the war, and 
she lived there and another couple, a Polish 
couple live. The apartment was large -- 
Q: Right.  

A: -- as -- for the -- for the Steins. 
Q: For the St eins, right.  
A: Yeah, yeah.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Okay. Let™s talk about when you actually have
 a job in the Tebbins shop. It -- when did -- 
how did -- 
A: Yeah, was a -- was a job. 

Q: Yes. 

A: It was a job for ausweiss, you know. 

Q: When you got the special pass. 

A: Right. And I don™t reme mber, I just went there 
and was told that I -- I can work there. And 
they were sewing the camouflage
 outside, the camouflage an-and 
the white part was underneath 
so they could, you know, in snow -- in snow, it 
doesn™t show. And I didn™t know how to sew on 
that, you know, sewing machine. So I was -- hadn™t
 finished some  of the thing. And th-the hours 
were terribl e, because it was -- I don™t remember , from
 eight to -- to one or two o-or fr om four to 
-- to 12 o™clock at night. And we we re fall asleep, 
of course, all of us. And we got food there, and 
they brought it in large kettle 
with soup, which wasn™t soup [indecipherable]. There was some  -- 
some  food a t  the very end, so it 
was lucky, you know, to get the -- 
Q: You me a n at the bottom of the pot. 

A: At the bottom of the p -- yeah. 

Q: I see. So did you try to
 wait the [indecipherable] 
A: We ll, some  did, of c ourse, ye
s. But -- and there was bread, I th
ink to the na -- probably now 
it™s a very -- very much looked after, this kind 
of bread which was dark -- black and you had all -
- all seven grains, or eight grains, whatever. 

Q: Yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
36 
 
A: And -- and th -- I worked there, but th-the 
first time which I got into
 this big walk, you know, 
through the Warsaw to deportation th
at -- I wasn™t at Tebbins, I wa
s at home , whatever I want -- 
went to look for some  -- some thing, I don™t reme mb
er what. And I was swept out with this large 
crowd which was filling in both sidewalks and the mi ddle of the road, they were just going 
people with children, with -- with
 bundles of -- of -- of food - -
 not food, I don™t know what, and 
that -- and we  were going toward Meeska, toward
 the Umschlagplatz and the gates were closed 

when the took out the people from the -- from 
the houses, they closed the gates. You know, 
that™s kind of gates what you come  at 11 o™clock 
that used to be, and you had to wake up the -- 
the guy who takes care of the -- an-and give him 
20 cents or whatever because you came  late. So 
they were -- they were closed tight  -- 

Q: You me a n, outside 
-- the outside gates -- 
A: -- outside, right, yeah.  

Q: -- of the house, yeah.  
A: Because the houses were -- they ha d that -- th
e gate was open over there, and you come  in and 
walk to the right or to the left
 or further down where it™s called 
Pardvuka, which was a larger part 
[indecipherable] some thing like that, where the 
housekeepers were -- were cleaning the rugs 
from upstairs. A-And -- but one of
 -- if wi -- I recognized one of the policemen that I knew him, 
and he recognized me , and he showed me  on the wa
y to Ums chlagplatz that 
one of the gates is a 
little bit open, not completelyshut, and I followed that. Came  out of the crowd and I thought 
well, I™ve nothing to lose, and sneak in the -- the --
 the gate. And there was a lot of people there, 
and we waited for a couple of hours until ev
eryt hi ng calme d down, and the people who were 
hiding in -- in the apartments, they
 came  out and they told us how to go to -- to different streets. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
37 
 
But the streets, you know, they -- the houses we
re cut like alleys so
 you can go through one 
street to another without co
mi ng out on the ma in street.  
Q: I see. 
A: And so I went home a nd they couldn™
t believe that I -- I am still there. 

Q: So they were frightened because they saw 
all these people and they knew you were in the 
street. 

A: Oh they -- they knew nobody -- nobody came out of 
it, and so they were very happy about it. 
Q: What did -- what did you know about
 these deportations at this time ?  
A: Oh, we know a lot, but we thought, you know, Jude
nrat helping to that. Th at this is all some  
lies. Those are young boys who just fled, you know, 
the [indecipherable] and -- and th-that™s not 
true, it™s -- but we started to believe that is so
me thing wrong at the end of the line. But a lot of 
people did believe.  

Q: So in -- in ™42, when the deportations 
begin, you™ve heard st
uff about Treblinka? 
A: Even before that. 

Q: E-Even before. 

A: Not trebli -- not a name -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- th-th-there were other names. There was S
obibor and there were -- 
th-there were -- that 
wasn™t the only trebli --  

Q: Right. 

A: Treblinka was the one which took so ma ny 
lives. That was the -- the end. There was no -- 
nobody, you know, nobody a-as far as I know nobody escaped from Treblinka. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
38 
 
A: I don™t know, do you? 
Q: Well, there was an escape 
later. There [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, ma ybe yeah. Because some  were left to l -- sort out the -- whatever th-the ot he rs left. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Yeah. But -- 

Q: So what did you be -- do you reme mber what 
you believed?  After -- at the attack on Russia, 
there™ s a lot of killing that goes on. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right?  That the Germans are killing. Do you h
ear about those killings as the Germans are 
attacking Russia in ™41? 

A: Oh yeah, we knew about it, yeah. 

Q: You do?  And what did -- 

A: Cause we -- we had this bulletin from [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. 
A: Who -- who brought in the -- the bulletins. 

Q: Right. 

A: And we knew what was go-going on in the wo
rld, and it™s -- it was getting, you know, better, 
and -- but who knew when it will end?  We  -- we 
t -- we thought at first, you know, when we 
lived outside the ghetto, that this w
ill last half a year, a year -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- but not five. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
39 
 
Q: Right. 
A: We ll, w-we -- we just didn™t -- I -- we didn™
t have time to think abou
t it, you know?  I-It -- it 
was struggling every day. Every day you need food, you 
need -- your mother is not we ll. It -- it 
wasn™t the -- the only -- when we got th
is news, it was far away, and nobody cares. Nobody 
cared. There was a time which I later found out, 
that Americans and English knew everything 
what is going on. So -- not only through Karski, 
there were ma ny other people who -- who came  
and -- and w- were telling what was going on, not
 only with Jews, but with Poles. And nobody 
could believe that they™re taking 
those people and just putting them 
under gas. At -- at first they 
were just r -- large vans, which we™ve heard a
bout it. No -- nobody believed it. It was -- it was 
impossible to believe. So everybody thought, yo
u know, where are we going?  But later on, it 
started to dawn on us that this is the end, a
nd everybody who could -- ther
e was building of hide-
a-way kind of things. You have a stove and you -- be
hind the stove there is a room there, and the 
-- so i -- you put the stove at --
 at the -- at the entrance, and 
there was nobody there. So these 
people survived. How they survived, it was terrible, because I was in one of those ones, and I 

was told that there were sma
ll children with us, and the parents knew if we hear some body 
comi ng [indecipherable] or SS, or what -- whatever
, that we ca -- we just have to smother the 
child. Yes. And since then, when I went to one 
of those because I was not at home, I was going 
out, and there was an alarm that Ukrainians ar
e comi ng, and I didn™t go an -- any more to these 

hiding places, yeah. 

Q: To this -- uh-huh. 

A: But there was a lot of these hi ding places, and 
I think until they -- they
 -- the up -- uprising in 
ghetto, that a lot of people were safe this wa
y. Oh, I -- of course, I -- I don™t know. A lot of 
people outside the ghettos w-were saved to the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
40 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- until the Polish uprising.  

Q: Let me  go back a little bit, to the 
work. How -- do you reme mber about how ma ny people 
were working in that  shop? 

A: We ll, I don™t reme mber exactly, but
 in my room there were probably 40. 
Q: 14? 

A: 40. 

Q: 40. 

A: 40.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But th-there were other rooms, you know, wher
e they were working. Ac
tually, they -- I must 
say on behalf of Tebbins  that he was giving th
ose ausweiss rather knowingly, that those people 
don™t know how to sew. 
Q: Uh-huh. Including you. 
A: Including me , yeah.  

Q: So nobody trained you on the ma chines? 

A: No, I -- no, I started to -- to 
use the machine when I was out of
 there, yeah. So that was -- 
Q: Was there -- were there Germans -- German officials in the shop? 

A: No, no -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- nobody, nobody. When the -- that 
-- that was kind of a relief
, that was nobody there except 
the supervisors. One was calle
d Jan -- Jahn -- Jan -- H -- J- a-h-
n. And when I was liberated 
already outside in Quakenbrick where we li -- used
 to live for awhile at the -- with the Polish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
41 
 
press, I saw a man on the street
 and I thought it was Jahn, and I to
ld Stefan, he said, oh, you have 
ideas. I saw him another time, and I was so sure
 that it was Jahn, but St
efan said no, that™s 
probably not. I gave up. You give up on -- on the lot 
of things. When we we
re at the -- under the 
bureau [indecipherable] under the Br
itish and we occupied as part 
of Germany, we got the pr int 
shop for our -- our newspaper. And the -- the 
owner of the print shop was comi ng to those 
journalists, and telling 
them, I never was a Nazi, I never -- 
never had anything to do with them, 
and [indecipherable] a-anything, he
 would say. And they were li
stening just, you know. Nothing 
-- nothing happened to any of those people, and he 
was a Nazi, there is no -- but there were a lot 
of them who had to join the -- 
the -- the party, because of thei
r living. He had very nice print 
shop and -- and he wanted to keep it, yeah.  
Q: We r -- were you able -- did you get some thing 
other than soup so that you -- some  food that 
you were able to bring back to your mother 
and your sister and brot
her-in-law, or not? 
A: N-No, no.  
Q: You couldn™t. And of course there was no pay, 
there was no -- it -- the only thing you got was 
food. 
A: No, that that I seen. I didn™t.  

Q: How long did you work there? 

A: That™s -- you know, it™s difficult fo
r me to say, I -- I -- I do-don™t know. 
Q: Months?  Years? 

A: I -- until -- right -- well, ma ybe a few m
onths. Until the moment when the -- the second 
Umschlagplatz happened to me , and then I st
opped working, and the only food it was -- which 
was smuggl ed and w-we bought, and it was pretty bad. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
42 
 
Q: So the first time you escaped deportation, you 
were just -- you-you™re ju
st sort of swept along 
on the street. You never get to the Umschlagplatz. 
A: No, I didn't. 

Q: Right. So that was probably July, do you think, ™42? 

A: That was July ™42. 

Q: The first -- the first wa ve of -- 

A: Right. 

Q:  - -  t h e  de por t at i ons . 

A: 20 - something, 25
th
.  
Q: Right, right. 

A: It was a -- a crowd which is difficult to
 explain. We  were walking one by one, and the 
children didn™t cry. It wa s quiet. 

Q: Really? 
A: Yes. Nobody tried to escape. We  were paraly
zed. I-It was a unbelievable scene, just those 
dogs ma rching, an-and there weren™t too ma ny Gest
apo people, they calle
d -- those are special 
forces -- were special forces I heard, at home. 
And at -- that what you st
ruck by the absolutely 
paralyzed people walking. It
™s -- it™s unbelievable, I -- it -- it --
 the -- the way I -- I -- I looked at 
this Jewish policeman, I thought I know hi m, and 
he kind of ma de it -- eye contact to me , and I 
thought he showed me  with his 
eyes the -- the next gate, whic
h was how -- and that was it. 
Q: So how do you explain the fact
 that you were not paralyzed? 
A: We ll, I don™t know. Some  people were not, 
you know. Some  people ma de their way probably 
in other gates. I 
-- I have no idea.  
Q: I guess it™s surprising that you would say it
 was so quiet. I woul
d have expected -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
43 
 
A: It was quiet. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. Maybe a -- a whi mper of 
a -- the child or something li --   
Q: But not much. 

A: -- but no, no, no. The same  was the sec
ond time when I was at Umschlagplatz. 
Q: So now -- 

A: Nobody said anything.  

Q: Really. So how -- how did it happen that you
 were at the Umschlagplatz the second time? 
Would that have been in July ag
ain, or wa -- August [indecipherable] 
A: No, no, it was -- no, it was later, it was September probably -- 

Q: September? 

A: -- yeah. And I was walking, y-you know, to 
get some money or food, I don™t know what. I 
went to Paviar Street, and all of 
a sudden I see a rush of people, but
 not as big, not as large as the 
previous one, the July one. And I was caught
 in it, and I walked 
with them. A young woma n 
walked with me  and we exchanged some  words, 
but not much. And we went to a barrack which 
was -- I don™t know what it was be fore, you know, because it™s -- was kind of re mod with tabl e 

and -- and chairs. And the chairs were ma de of
 s t eel, you know, the kind
 of -- some t hing like 
what we use now when a lot of people come . 
And we found a place and we  sit down and waited 
for the train.  

Q: So you™re at the Ums c hlagplatz you think? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: You™re at the Umschlagplatz? 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
44 
 
Q: And you™re waiting. 
A: And outside there was no -- no Ge rmans inside, 
or ma ybe they were at the doors, but outside 
the -- were Ukrainians with dogs. And that wa
s it, it was kind of quiet, nobody talked unless 
whispered to some body. And I noticed that so
me  people are going around and behind me , going 
to some thing which is open, and stairs are leadin
g. And I talked to my companion, I said, I think 
there is some thing there. And she sai
d, yes I know. How do you know?  Some body probably 
escape, but she said Ukrainians 
come  later and shoot the people
 who are hiding. So there is no 
way. I said, well let™s try. And she 
tells -- she said no, I don™t want to
 because I still 
hope that I™ll 
find my fa mily. I didn™t say it -- anything. And sh
e took money out of her -- you know, the -- the 
-- there used to be [indecipherable]
 which is -- they were different
 kind of -- there were no tights, 
but they were draw -- you know, yo-you draw
 from your corset and tie your -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- your -- yeah -- 
Q: Your -- your stockings. 
A: Right. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And she -- she -- I said, I am going. And sh
e took out money out of, you know, her stocking, 
and gave it to me . I turned around and you know th
at -- these iron chairs 
were noisy, so I tried 
not to ma ke noise. I got up and sl-sli
nked down, and went dis -- up the stairs. 
Q: So did you go on the floor?  So you didn't stand up? 

A: I -- I almost didn™t stand up. I was ju
st crouching, li-like this, and I walk. 
Q: Right.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
45 
 
A: When I went the stairs, they were dark a
nd when I came  up, it -- it was a -- a door to some  
kind of a attic or -- or I don™t know what it was,
 and wa -- there were some  furniture, sa -- some  
things were lying down, but it was completely da
rk. And I went there a
nd I -- I just sit down on 
the floor. And it was quiet, very
 quiet. I think I -- my heart 
was, of course, pounding. It stopped 
pounding after ma ybe I don™t know, half an hour or s
o. And I probably fell 
asleep, because what 
I heard the next, it was [indecipherable] of these 
chairs and steps and late
r on schnell, schnell, the 
Ukrainians with the dogs, and 
it -- it took quite awhile. And I fe
lt that people are around me , 
yeah.  
Q: But you didn't see anybody? 

A: No, I didn™t see, because it was dark. 

Q: Right. 

A: I don™t know, they -- it was a stockroom, so s o
me kind of a -- a -- and 
then I heard the train 
and the doors closing down. And we
 waited. I think we all fell as
leep probably. Kind of a early 
morning, we heard voices. One vo-voice, or two ma
ybe, and they said, just stay where you are, 
don™t move. And we -- we thought what is -- but 
in Polish, not [indecipherable] and we thought, 

wa -- what is it? And came  there, either they we
re dressed like me dical pe
ople or they -- they put 
it on, I -- I have no idea. And they let us out and 
took us to the hospital. Ga ve us some  tea and 
some thing, and show us the way to ghetto. 

Q: So the room that you were in w -- led 
into the hospital that
 was right next door? 
A: Oh, no, it wasn™t very next door, but there wa 
-- probably wa s close. They had the -- some  
kind of part in. Maybe they ma de th
e -- some  kind of opening in the -- 
Q: In the wall? 

A: In the -- no, it wasn™t the wall. I
-It was -- th-the long fence, whatever. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
46 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yeah. Th-This kind of a -- 

Q: So how -- 

A: I don™t know whether it was electracized, I don™t -- 

Q: Really? 

A: -- I had -- I -- I can™t te
ll you because I have no idea. 
Q: So nobody came upstairs?  The Ukrainians di
dn™t come  upstairs and look at the group? 
A: Oh, they did. 

Q: They did? 

A: They did. 

Q: And they saw -- 

A: They looked in, and they le
ft. I heard the -- her-heard them. 
Q: With dogs? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: No.  

Q: They came  without dogs. 

A: Withoutdogs. 

Q: Because the dogs certainly would have smelled you. 

A: Just the we -- with the weapons
. But they didn™t, not this time. 
Q: Now, do you have -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
47 
 
A: What ma -- what my friends, you know, wa -- 
walking friend, told me  that they come  and 
shoot whatever, you know. But they didn™t, no. I 
seen them putting their weapons insi de and 
looking, but they left.  
Q: They didn™t. And you didn't want to say to yo
ur friend, but you™re goi
ng to get killed and -- 
from this train?  Reme mb er when your friend 
said, I don™t want to go because I™ll get shot? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right?  You didn™t say to her, but ev
erybody™s going to get killed on this train 
[indecipherable] 

A: No, I don™t remember . 

Q: You don™t reme mber. Do you have any idea how 
the people from the hospital knew that all of 
you were there? 

A: Oh, they knew. 

Q: They knew? 
A: They knew because they -- they done several time s that, you know?   
Q: I see, I see. So about how ma ny of
 you do you think were in that room?  
A: I think we re 10 or some thing, or ma ybe 11 -- 

Q: So a very small numb er. 

A: -- I don™t know, I think I can™t s-say exact -- ye s, because I seen them going, yeah. 

Q: And this was September of ™42? 

A: Right. 

Q: So it™s the end of the big 
deportations in ™42. Do you -- did you then go back to your 
apartment where -- where your family was? 

A: Yeah. Again they coul dn™t be lieve it.

in those shops at that point, yes?  Or not? 
A: No.

A: No, I wasn™t on the street. I 
was at Tebbins, and Tebbins came  
in and told us to go down, all 
of us, and set up four in each row, and we went. We thought it™s, you know, showing the 
ausweiss, but it wasn™t, a

A: I probably was depressed, I don™t know.  

Q: Is it -- is it -- it™s hard to reme mb
e r  what the feelings were, I guess, hm? 

A: We ll, the feelings, what I was doing, I -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber.  

A: I reme mb er only that after 
the big clean-up deporta
tion, that three of us, my sister and 
brother-in-law -- oh, he™s
 not a brother-in-law. 
Q: Brother-in-law. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. 

A: Brother-in-law. We  went to, 
cause it was one big apartment, a
nd there were rooms, occupied 
by different people, and we
 went to one of those rooms, and there was nobody there, and things 
were f -- thrown, you know, and looked like some
body was trying to [indecipherable] some thing. 
And there was food on the table, and we just le
ft that and we thought 
ma ybe they will come  
back, but they didn™t. So -- 

Q: So did you -- did you go into that 
place, or  you stayed where you were? 
A: No, no, we didn™t. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
52 
 
Q: You didn™t. 
A: No. 

Q: So how is it that you finally 
decided to leave [indecipherable] 
A: Well, i-it -- Stefan came in 
in I think October or Novembe r , 
I don™t reme mber, and said that 
his ausweiss is running out, and he said that 
they are trying to ma ke
 a -- a come through -- 
karmeleetska [i ndecipherable] street , which will be
 a -- the tunnel, and people could es-escape, 
that my relations, and my relatives will be  able
 to go through that. And he said, as of you, you 
are welcome to my apartment. And - -  and that 
was it, I didn't hear from him any more . Oh, and 
he told me  how to get out, and I got out. 

Q: But how did you ma ke that decision, since you hadn™t been able to ma ke that decision before?  

You™re still with your family, so you must 
be feeling some  obligation towards them. 
A: Yes, I did. But they were kind of -- of id
ea that some how they will get out, you know, through 
-- through this -- well, it was terrible, 
I-I can™t talk about it, not even now. 
Q: I see. Really?  So you left through that hidi 
-- that -- that tunnel?  Is
 that how you got out of 
[indecipherable] 

A: No, no, this tunnel has 
not -- never been built.  
Q: Uh-huh. So then, how did you get out? 

A: We ll, there were other places you can get ou
t. It was a -- a hole 
in the wall and the -- 
some body was keeping this always closed up, but at
 certain mome nt they open up and let people 

out.  

Q: We re you -- you were not recognizably Je
wish, you didn™t look Jewish, but you certainly 
must have looked like you had liv
ed in the ghetto when you left. 
A: Oh, of course I did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
53 
 
Q: So were you worried that some body 
was going to stop you and arrest you? 
A: We ll no, it was very funny because it started to snow when wi -- I waited at this 
[indecipherable], the housekeeper who -- who done 
this for money. When he let me out, there 
was su -- suddenly the rushka, you know what™s th
e rushka? The rushka is a horse driven -- 
Q: Uh-huh. Carriage? 

A: Carr -- you know how they -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- with the -- with the [ind
ecipherable] and was snowing, a
nd I got in and told him the 
address, and he took me  there. I don™t know whet her Stefan arranged it. Was all of a sudden, you 

know, on empty street because it st
arted to get dark and we™re 
supposed to be at home . And 
that™s the way I came out.  

Q: And whe r e was his apartment? 

A: In the -- in the -- downtown. 
Q: And wha t  is it called, Sliska? 
A: Shliska, right.  

Q: Shliska. 

A: How do you know that?  Where did you get that?   

Q: I think you gave it to -- you gave 
some  infor mation to some people. 
A: I did? 

Q: Yeah, to Miles, who di
d an interview with you. 
A: Oh, that™s right, yeah, to Miles. 

Q: It was 12 Shniska Street? 

A: Right, yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
54 
 
Q: And had you ever been there before?  Had you seen that before? 
A: No, no, I didn™t, because they -- he had to mo ve
 from the street which he used to live before 
the war --  

Q: Oh, I see, this was -- 

A: -- and they gave him an apartment -- 

Q: I see.  

A: -- which was occupied before by Jews. 

Q: Right. So did you know the people -- there we
re some  people who were already hiding. 
A: Yeah, they were there. No -- not
 -- not s -- all of them hiding, no. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Some just lived there, because large apartmen
t that -- and you have to 
rent it. And there was 
Dr. Jeshelsky there with his wife and a little 
girl. And was Bronka [ind
ecipherable] Finkelstein, 
who never went to ghetto. 
Q: Oh, she was the one who never went? 
A: Yeah, she was the one. And la
ter on she -- Stefan arranged for her an apartment at the same  
house and she moved to this apartment. And then
 wer -- then came the uprising in ghetto, and 
telephone from my sister that they are going to --
 with Tebbins [indecipherable] and that was the 
last time I heard from he r. 

Q: So phones still worked up through the uprising -- 

A: At this time, yeah. 

Q: -- in ™43? 

A: Right. I don™t know where she called me  -- 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
55 
 
A: -- but at that time  we didn™t ha
ve a phone. She called from some whe r e. 
Q: And did you ever find out what had happened? 
A: Of course. 

Q: And wa -- th -- were they -- we
re they taken to where she said? 
A: Yes. They shot them, all of them.  

Q: And you found that out much later, or 
did you find that out while you were -- 
A: No, I -- I found out pretty soon. 

Q: Pretty soon. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So that must have been very hard on you. 

A: Right.  

Q: So you™re hiding out for more than a year? 

A: Mm. 
Q: Your -- and when do you b
ecome  Sophie Yablunska?  Soon? 
A: Yeah, after a few mo nths.  
Q: So when -- when you come  into the apar
tment, how -- do you -- do you soon become very 
close to Stefan? I mean, does -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- so -- so that you become  -- 

A: Right, a couple. 

Q: A couple. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. And had you thought about this before, 
or was this so -- surprise, sort of -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
56 
 
A: No, it wasn™t a surprise. 
Q: It wasn™t a surprise. But this was -- this 
ha d not been happening, or -- or when you saw each 

other in the ghetto, did you bot
h r e al ize t h at  t h er e wer e  st
rong feelings between -- 
A: Yeah, well there were 
strong feelings, yeah.  
Q: Yeah. He was in the u
nderground at this point -- 
A: Mm. 

Q: -- so when you become  Sophie Yablunska, 
do you now start working with him in some  
[indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, I helped, mm-hm, whatever I -- 

Q: And wha t  were you doing? 

A: Well, to -- to place the bulle
tin -- information bulletin to pe
ople around the -- where I had the 
addresses. 

Q: We re you ever worried that some body would denounce you? 
A: Yes.  
Q: And did it -- 

A: And we had guests, uh-huh, who came in for money. 

Q: You had guests? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Who ca me in for -- 

A: Guests. 

Q: Guests, who were l
ooking. And what happened? 
A: And asking for other addresses. 

Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
57 
 
A: But nothing happened when we [i ndecipherable]. 
At that time  I went for a couple of months 
to -- to Stefan™s parent  in a different place, but nothing happened. 
Q: And his -- 

A: Or -- or once we had to run through the kitchen entrance, run away 
from the same  kind of 
people. 

Q: And you -- you -- 

A: Yeah, well -- 

Q: -- you ran out of the apartment, or di -- yes. 

A: Ran out of, yeah. 

Q: Quite a life, huh? 

A: Until --  until -- 

Q: Until the uprising. 

A: -- the uprising. 
Q: And how -- how is the situation now in -- in 
-- how different from being in the ghetto?  Did 
you have food, and you had [indecipherable] 
A: Oh, we had the food. It was not too much, but
 we had food. And I cooked and well, as -- 
Q: We re you a -- were you a good cook? 

A: Yeah. I don™t know, no. 

Q: No. 

A: Not yet, not yet, because Stefan always re
mi nds me  when he came and potatoes were boiling 

and I was asking my mother, mo m, ho-how mu
ch salt, do I put salt?  So it was a -- 
Q: So your living conditions wereactually muchbetter together? 

A: Oh yes, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
58 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Of course, yeah.  

Q: Did -- did you find it, I don™t know, disturbing
 or odd that the difference between the ghetto 
situation and the rest of occupied Warsaw was so different? 

A: Yeah, well, it was different, ye
s, it was different, but th -- they 
suffered a lot, too, and all of a 
sudden, you know, come s a German outfit and rounds
 up several blocks and takes out people 
from trams a nd take them to -- to Germany to 
work, or just shoot them
 for no reason. And some 
who were taking part in underground were take
n out and you know, they -- they were shooting 
them or taking them to a concentration camp. So they suffered, yeah -- 

Q: And -- but what -- 

A: -- a lot. 

Q: -- di -- I imagine -- 

A: I mean, in regular circumstances, Poles suffe
red a lot. But you can™t compare to what was 
happening in ghettos. There is no comparison.  

Q: Right. And do you think that the -- the Polish
 ca -- the Catholics that
 you were me e ting, the 
non-Jews that you were meeting understood th
at there was such a [indecipherable] 
A: Oh yes, oh yes. The one I me t, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Well, ther e were ot hers who will come and ask for money and -- and ot her addr esses where a 

-- where Jews live [indecipherable] you know, it™s -- 
it™s a -- it™s always a -- and it was also on 
the Poles side, if you find a Gestapo or SS or 
whatever, they find the house where Jews are 

hidden, they would shoot everybody or ta
ke everybody to a concentration camp. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
59 
 
A: So it was -- it was quite a decision
 to take Jews in, especially me n. 
Q: Why especially men? 
A: We ll, they were circumcised. 

Q: Oh, oh, taking in Jewish me n, uh-huh, I see what you mean, yes, right. So they could be easily 

found out. So do you think more wome n were -- were
 saved in these circumstances than me n -- 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: -- because it was less dangerous? 

A: Probably. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Probably. We ll, me n usually, at
 the ghetto situation in the begi
nning and later, they choose to 
go east. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that was a good idea. That 
-- thi -- it doesn™t mean that
 they didn™t wind up in a gulag. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, for differ e nt reasons. But there is 
a -- was a much higher chance for them to stay 
alive.  

Q: Mm-hm. So did you know about 
the plans for the uprising -- 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- in [indecipherable] you did? 

A: Yeah. We knew. 

Q: And was -- 

A: And Stefan left at four o™cloc
k, the first of August. But, well, it 
-- it was also a terrible time, 
terrible time, especially at the 
end when the uprising went down. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
60 
 
Q: Yes, cause it was [indecipherable] 
A: Well, we had to wait for the Red Cr oss to -- to 
ma ke sure that we are -- be treated as -- not as 
bandits, but as fighters.  

Q: As POW -- you mean as soldiers. 

A: Right, right. 

Q: So the Red Cross came  in?  

A: Oh, Red Cross came in, yeah, uh-huh.  

Q: And so Stefan is taken as a prisoner of war? 

A: Right, and me  too. 

Q: And you too? 

A: Right. I was working at the ho
spital at that time. I started to
 work when the uprising started, 
and I stayed there, and we were taken. 

Q: We ll, what were you doing in the hospital? 
A: Oh, I -- helping. 
Q: Just helping the --  

A: Yeah.  

Q: -- yeah. 

A: Y-You know, the nurse -- there was few nurses.  

Q: Mm. 

A: Few, very few nurses who could be, you know, ta
king care of the wounds, or -- or things like 
that. But -- and that was th
e only thing I™ve been doing.  
Q: Hm. And so the Germans actually respec
ted the -- the Red Cross [indecipherable]  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
61 
 
A: The finally day there, yeah, respected and 
-- well, it was -- you know, 
it was quiet all of a 
sudden. [indecipherable] Wa rsaw came out and we 
went also to the house which we lived in. 
And the only thi -- we -- he was a reporter for th
e uprising and wrote, also. And we hide it -- his 
films and his -- some  things which were valuable. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And his portrait. He had a portrai
t done, 30™s or some thing, still hanging. 
Q: Really? 

A: And we came to it in the late 60™s. A friend 
of -- of the house which we left that in her 
baseme nt, and she wrote to us that she has it, do you want it? 

Q: Oh, wow. 

A: So we did. It was all in holes
 and Stefan took it into basement
. So Peter and I, we took it out 
and I started walking -- Connecticut
 was at that time fa mous for th
e small art st ores and I went 
from one to another and they 
said no, no. And all of a sudden 
a -- an -- an older man said, you 
know, I know a -- a painter who pain
ted the way this [indecipherable
] this portrait and she did a 
good job, and --  

Q: And filled in the holes. 

A: -- it™s hanging. 

Q: Huh. So you -- he™s taken some where, and you 
were -- you were taking -- taken to Zalfine? 
A: Zalfine. 

Q: Zalfine. 

A: Yeah. We didn't know where we are going. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Because they put us in those -- you know, they -- 
this kind of -- what did 
they call this?  The -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
62 
 
Q: A wagon ? 
A: A wagon, yeah. And we didn™t know where we
 were going. So -- and once in awhile they 
would open up that, and a crowd of
 people were comi ng with vegeta
bles and all kinds of -- of 
goodies. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, and -- 

Q: Are you on a train or on a truck? 

A: On a train. 

Q: On a train. 

A: On a train, yeah. 

Q: I see, okay. 

A: And we were asking them, where are we goi
ng?  And he said, you going 
the right direction. I 
mean, it™s not southeast, but you goi
ng -- not southeast, southwest. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But you going west.  

Q: Right. 

A: So we knew that we we
re not going to Auschwitz. 
Q: Right. Were they -- did they 
treat you with s -- a certain ki
nd of respect because you were 
fighters, or were they br
utal to you, the Germans ?  
A: No, they were -- they w -- those were all 
the Germans who -- would took care of the train. 
And the same was the -- at the camp too. There wa s 
one accident. They warn us that we have to 
[indecipherable] the -- the windows, taking care 
by hanging the -- the blankets or some thing, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
63 
 
one blanket fell, half of it, a
nd the guard from the camp shoot, and shot a li -- a young girl from 
our -- yeah. And there was -- af
ter that, you know, they were 
a -- apologizing and all that. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah, they did, uh-huh. 

Q: I guess they thought the wa
r was ending [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, but this girl 
was shot. She was ma ybe 20. 
Q: Oh. 

A: That was ac -- this accident 
and then we had bombardme nt, a lot of it. Americans came  at 
night and the English came, you know.  

Q: And they were bombarding the -- the camp, or were they -- 

A: No, not the camp -- 

Q: -- [indecipherable] the train? 

A: -- but close by, yeah, very close by, yeah. Dresno. 
Q: And -- and what was 
it like in the camp? 
A: We ll, it was hunger, and that was it. But at Ch
ristma stime we got Red Cross packages, right. 
One package like that wa s for four people, and 
there were cigarettes and some  sweets, goodies. 
And we divided it, who smoked took the cigarette
s and -- and so on, we divided that too, yeah. 
Q: Was it as bad as the ghetto? 

A: Oh, no. 

Q: No?  

A: No. We  felt safe. 

Q: You felt safe? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
64 
 
A: Right. Was no [indecipherable] commander, a-
and s-sudden deportation and all that, that -- 
that was out of the question. 
Q: So there w -- people were not 
being shot, people weren™t -- 
A: No, no. 

Q: So that was not -- it was not -- I see. 

A: No, it was camp for the POW.  

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. And were you separated by nationality in the camp ? 

A: No. N-No, it -- i-it wa s in a sense, yes, you
™re right. It -- it was a Polish camp and a Russian 
camp. 

Q: I see. 

A: And I think I s-said before about 
our doctor who was so wonderful, and -- 
Q: What was his name? 

A: -- and saved -- Ben Kofski.  

Q: Ben Kofs ki. 

A: I can write for you how -- 

Q: Mm-h m?  

A: Ben [indecipherable] wonderful ma n. 

Q: And was he from Wa r saw, or from another part of -- 

A: Oh, from Wa rsaw [indecipherable] 

Q: Yeah. And did you know hi m from before? 

A: No, I didn't know hi m. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
65 
 
Q: No. And -- and did other people have fairly
 good treatment or you don™t know how it was in 
the other sections of the -- 
A: In this s --  this Russ
ian section was very bad. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: We  ca me  at the end, actually, and they were
 just died of hunger a
nd tuberculosis. And only 
the one who were going out of the camp, work
ing for Ger mans, you know, for the out -- you 
know, to do things, were, you know, who were able 
to repair some thing or
 do any kind of work. 
Q: So the Russians were treated the worst? 

A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: Did -- were you fearful about Stefan? 

A: I -- I knew where he went. 

Q: Oh, you did? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: He went to Affloc, Grossburn. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It™s in Germany, but late
r on I didn™t know any more. 
Q: Right. Now, when you are s -- liberated, you are disappointed that the Russians have come , 

and -- 

A: Very mu ch. 

Q: -- not the Americans, yes. 

A: Very mu ch, yeah. Well, they came , you know,
 and they opened a food storage of Nazis. 
There were a few Nazis killed and I -- I don™t kn
ow what they were before they came. I think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
66 
 
probably some  Russians did that. And -- and they
 came and they opened the storage with rice 
and who knows what, and started to feed us. It wa
sn™t a good idea because we were not prepared 
for that, yeah. 
Q: Did you get sick? 

A: Well, a little bit, yeah.  

Q: But then the Russians said that if 
you are Polish you have to go back to Poland. 
A: Right. 

Q: And you didn't want to do that. 

A: No. 

Q: And a number of you didn't want to do that. 

A: No. 

Q: And so you escaped? 

A: Right. At the gate -- 
Q: You™re very -- 
you™re very brave. 
A: Oh, I don™t know. Not any more. The gate
 was practu -- practic
ally open, you know, 
some ti me s there was a si -- th-the Russian sold
iers stood. But ma ny ti mes they gave it to Polish 
men to take care of the gate. So I joined the --  a 
part of -- now this is it, a part of the two wome n 
and two Belgians, me n.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They had the -- something wi-wit
h their hands, how do you call this? 
Q: An armb a -- a -- 

A: Yeah, well, they were wounded, but -- 

Q: Oh, you mean banda ges? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
67 
 
A: Bandages. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. And we decided to -- to go. I went to 
this guy who was guarding the gate and I told him 
that we will probably leave early in the morning, really early. He said 
go ahead [indecipherable] 
early. And -- because  he had the -- to take care of the gate. And we left, and we walked and 

walked and walked, I don™t reme mbe r  how long, to
 Elba river -- river, there was the -- the 
frontier of -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- at the time and we -- I 
think that we walked about 
four days. I don™t know how ma ny 
kilome ters it was, I had to look at the ma p, still couldn™t figure
 out how long it was. 
Q: It was a long walk. 

A: I-It was a long one. We -- we 
just took, you know, break for the 
night and it -- everything was 
empty and things were trashed out because I thin
k the Russians already took care of the -- of the 
better things and left it there, yeah. There 
were chicken wandering ar
ound, but no sign of -- of 
Germans, who used to live there. So we came to
 Elba river, and there on one side were the 
Russians, on the other side were -- we re Americans. And the Russians read what the Be lgians 

gave them, whatever they had a
nd -- and they just said -- 
Q: To go. 

A: To go. 

Q: Hm.  

A: So we went to Americans. 

Q: And I think we need to st
op the tape, it™s almost -- 
A: Yeah. Okay.

Q: Yes. I -- 

A: It wasn™t before 
so -- that so strong. 
Q: What? 

A: What? 

Q: The light?  The light feels st
ronger to you?  It™s the same . 
A: Right now, I don™t know, it -- 

Q: It™s the same. 

A: Probably sitting too long. 

Q: Tell me  some thing. When you 
left the camp and escaped -- 
A: Uh-huh? 
Q: -- how did you know where to go? 
A: Well, we™re going to Americans. 

Q: I™m sorry, we have to [indecipherable]. Okay? 

A: See, we -- we ge -- 

Q: So how did you -- what do you mean you knew 
where you were going?  You lo -- you leave a 
ca -- this -- this camp, and you knew what direction? 

A: Yeah, we had a ma p, yeah. 

Q: Oh, you had a -- 

A: Oh yeah, sure. 

Q: -- that™s what I was wondering, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
70 
 
A: Yes, yeah. Yeah, the Belgians, they had a ma p, yeah. 
Q: Right. And the Belgians, when they showed 
the papers to the Russians, what was on these 
papers? 

A: They didn™t know what it is. 

Q: They didn™t? 

A: Russians didn™t know. 

Q: They didn™t know. 

A: No. Is it -- 

Q: They just said go, they didn™t care. 

A: No. 

Q: So you were pleased. You went to the -- 

A: Yeah, we were supposed to be French or whatever. 

Q: I see. 
A: Yeah, it™s [indecipherable] and they were im
pressed by that, so -- 
and they didn™t say 
anything. 
Q: Right. And you didn't want to go back to Poland, why? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Why didn™t you want to go back to Poland? 

A: Well, it was Communism, Stalin. A
nd for Stefan nothing to do there.

live here, we  have to pay. And we
 lived upstairs and they lived downstairs. We ll, we just didn™t 
do anything to them. We  were kind to them. Bu

they went through certain bad times, the -- the bo
mbardment and -- and -- and this whole Hitler

Q: And you moved to Engla

A: And then we moved to Engl

47, winter, yeah. 
Q: And is that because St efan got a j

A: No, no, it was a -- a kind of a special camp they

79 
 
Q: Yes? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you learn English before you got to England, did you know enough English? 

A: Very little, very little. Less than now. 
Sometimes I speak not pe
rfect, but -- but quite good 
English, and sometimes I l -- I -- I lost  it today. 

Q: No, you [indecipherable] 

A: I don™t have -- I don™t have the how to say 
the hold on -- on the languag
e which I -- the words 
which I want to say, escape me . But j ust the 
-- the plain talking, it™s 
-- it™s alright, you know. 
Q: Did you like being in England? 

A: Yes, but it was a hard life after war. Ever
ything was ra-rationed. I reme mber eggs were 
comi ng from -- from Poland and they were not e-ea
table. And you get just only so much me at a -
- a month, or some thing like that. And we went 
-- when we were living in England -- oh, we 
bought a house, and we were renting the upstairs 
and living downstairs. And it -- it -- it was a 
kind of -- quite shortcomings, a lot of shortcomings
. For instance, when we left -- when we were 
supposed to leave England, I saved my meat coupons
 so we s -- we could ma ke a party for our 
friends, and then -- so we didn™t 
eat -- eat -- didn™t use the cou
pon. And Peter at that time was -- 

oh, and bacon, was no bacon. And I reme mber that we
 saved the bacon for Peter [indecipherable] 
that was impossible now to -- to 
save such a thing. We ll, anywa
y, that -- it -- it -- but -- but it 
was, you know, pleasant. 

Q: Tell me  when -- when was it that you found out th
e extent of the murder
 of the Jews by the -- 
by the Germans?  Wa s it soon after the war, or mu ch later -- 

A: Not soon -- 

Q: Not soon. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
80 
 
A: -- not soon, no, no. Really, the extent of what
 happened, I found out here, when we were here 
already. Actually, after around ™55, or -- 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. When they start to -- you know, it was 
very slow comi ng to th-they were talking about 
this, survivors, and they were talking about 
opening the camps, which were -- but i-it was just 
news, and that™s all. There was no -- no la
rger insight of what really happened. 
Q: Did people ask you what happened to you? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. 

Q: Did you want to talk about it? 

A: No, I never wanted. 

Q: You never? 
A: No. 
Q: You still don™t. 

A: I still don™t. This is the onl
y one, and I hope it™s not going to 
spread to the -- everybody. But i-
it™s very hard to me. First of all, I feel  guilty that  I left  my fa mily, am still guilty. And I just don™t 

like to talk about it. 

Q: Is it -- is -- is that -- is -- 
that™s the event that is the hard
est for you, right. Do you think it™s 
important that people know what pe
ople like you went through, and -- 
A: We ll, probably is, but you know, I™m not the 
only one who is open to 
tin -- t-telling. My 
Polish friends don™t know much about it, they -- they
 know that I am Jewish, but that™s all. They 
-- I don™t think they want to listen to
 that. And I don™t want to talk -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
81 
 
Q: [indecipherable] 
talk about, right. 
A: -- which is just wonderful. 
Q: Are these Polish friends who were bor
n in Poland, or they were born here? 
A: Oh yes, they were born in Poland and some  of them I kne w before they -- no, s --  

Q: Before the war. 

A: -- that they are not alive. Oh yes,
 I -- I -- I know them, 
I -- I know Novak -- 
Q: So that -- 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Right. 

A: Milosh not so well, but Novak very well, and 
I think they -- they just  guess it, or  something 
like that. 

Q: So, when you were with these folks, you never talked about the war? 

A: About the ghetto? 
Q: About the ghetto. 
A: We ll, they know everything. 

Q: They know. 

A: They know, sure. Not about me . 

Q: Not about you. 

A: Yeah. But of course they know. 

Q: So Novak never said, what was your expe
rience since he was liv
ing there and he -- 
A: Yeah, I™m not so clos e to Novak [ind
ecipherable] we just 
greet each other -- 
Q: Uh-huh, right, right. 

A: -- and th-that™s all. But no, I just don™
t want to talk abou
t it. It™s hurting. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
82 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Badly. 

Q: So how come  you agreed to -- to be interviewed? 

A: We ll, your friend. 

Q: Elizabeth?  She was -- 

A: She was very -- yeah, she was started with a lit 
-- we-well I -- when I -- I talked to Mr. Kaye -
- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I think she probably heard some thing, I don™t 
know. But Mr. Kaye wrote me  a letter saying 
that this is [indecipherable] and 
send me  a letter that were very sa
tisfactory but they wa nt to see 
you. And then I thought, well, we™ll find out
, and hi -- what™s her name , hidel -- 
Q: Elizabeth. 

A: Elizabeth. 
Q: Yes. 
A: Elizabet h started to call me, and 
she has a very, very nice voice. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And I thought, she is so nice, you know?  And I 
-- I -- I didn't  want 
to, and finally I did. 
Q: Now, do -- your son knows your story, however, Peter. 

A: Peter knows the story that this, this, this ha
ppened, but he di -- he 
is not very keen about 
knowing about the details. But I 
am leaving something for him. 
Q: You are? What -- some thing you™ve written? 

A: We ll, he did -- he di -- date -- he does
n™t do that knowledge [ind
ecipherable] but, you know, 
busy, and this and that going on, 
but generally he does know, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
83 
 
Q: So you™ve written an auto -- a 
-- a kind of me moir of your life? 
A: No, not finished, no. 
Q: Not finished, but you are writing.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: You don™t want to say that you do, because it -- 

A: Yeah, no, no, it™s a -- it™
s in Polish and -- 

Q: Uh-huh. Are you mor e  comfortable in
 Polish than you are in English? 
A: Oh yes, I am, yes, ye s -- 

Q: [indecipherable] yeah. 

A: -- yeah. But now I mixed, you know, and th -- 
all of a sudden I know a word in -- in Polish, 
and couldn™t find it in English -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and -- and it 
-- getting older. 
Q: Have you been back to Poland -- 

A: Oh yes, mm-hm. 

Q: -- a number of times?  And how do you find th -- is
 it difficult -- was it difficult for you to go 
back to Poland? 

A: Well, no, it wasn™t difficult, and 
I didn™t find my Warsaw from before. 
Q: It™s a -- it™s a different place, yeah. 

A: It was a bu -- very nice town, beautiful. 

Q: And it™s not -- 

A: Oh no, no. Has been demolished completely. When everybody left, the Germans came and 

put this fire -- I don™t know, 
that has special name for it, 
fire throwers, you know, to burn 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
84 
 
everythi ng. They burned completely the -- the on
ly places which I recognized, because ghetto 
was completely down, is th -- ar e 
the -- the important arteri es like
 [indecipherable] Lazienki, the 
beautiful park where the Chopin™s 
-- oh, now I know in Polish and don™t know in the -- statue is -
- yeah, where they have concert and so on. This -- 
this -- this is the same , but the Ame r icans, for 
some  reason, demolished one of the lovely, beau
tiful [indecipherable] house, and put an ugly 
thing, ugly. 

Q: Really? 

A: Modern, you know, the under -- the kind which 
you see in [indecipherable]. I don™t know why 
they did it. Well, anyway, all thos
e bi g arteries are the same  as th
ey used to be, but the rest is 
completely demolished, and it was St alinist repl a -- la
 -- di  --  replaced with Stalinist architecture. 
Q: Right. 

A: So -- 

Q: Did you -- when you went back to Poland, di
d you visit camps, or you didn™t? Auschwitz, 
Treblinka, Sobibor -- 
A: Yeah, I went to Auschwitz, yeah. Treblinka 
is not -- doesn™t exist,
 or -- I don™t know. 
Q: There™s a -- there™s a me morial 
there, there™s me morial stones -- 

A: Oh maybe there is a me morial. 

Q: But you did go to Auschwitz? 

A: Yes, I did. 

Q: With Stefan? 

A: No, I was by myself. 

Q: By yourself? 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
85 
 
Q: Why did you do that? 
A: Why did I go to Auschwitz? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t know. I just went. Some  
people don™t go there, you know?  Yeah. 
Q: Right, right. Have you been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington? 

A: Oh yes, yes.  

Q: Yes?

Q: What did you think? 

A: We re very good. 

Q: Yeah? 
A: Once only. 
Q: It™s enough.  

A: I guess for everybody, I don™t know. The schoolchil
dren, they come  and enjoy it or what -- 
what -- what do they think? 

Q: Well -- 

A: What do the schoolchildren think about it? 

Q: I think it depends. I think it depends how mu ch 
they studied before, how serious they are. If 
they™re too young, who knows?  But they -- clearly a lot of them get very affected by it. 

A: Really? 

Q: That™s important.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0412  
86 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: I hope.  

A: If they could believe it. 

Q: Yes, I think, yeah. It™s hard to 
believe it, isn™t it, even for you? 
A: Yeah, it is. 

Q: Mm. Did you enjoy living in the United States? 

A: Yes, very much.

cause Stefan was teaching in Monterey, and he
