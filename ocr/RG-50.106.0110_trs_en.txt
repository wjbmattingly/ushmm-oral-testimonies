Question: This is the 
United States 
Holocaust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Peter Masters, 
conducted by 
Esther Finder
 on August 
7
th
, 1998, in 
Bethesda, Maryland. 
This is a follow-up inte
rview that will focus on 
Mr. 
Master™s 
post-Holocaust experiences. In pr
eparation for this interview I 
listened to the interview conduc
ted with the Survivors of the 
Shoah
 Visual History 
Foundation on Novemb er 10
th
 of 1996. I also reviewed
 your book. I will not ask 
you to repeat everythi
ng you said in that interview, 
instead I will use this interview 
as an opportunity to  follow up on th at 
interview and focus on your post-Holocaust 
experiences. This is tape number one, side
 A. 
I™d like to ask you when you were 
born and wh ere. 
Answer: I wa Œ I was born on the fifth of February , 1922 in
 Vien na, Austria. 
Q: And what was your name at birth? 

A: My name was 
Peter Ferdinand Arany, a-r-a-n-y. 
Q: When  did you change your name? 
A: My name was changed by 
war office order on join ing 
the comma ndos in 1942, I 
believe.  
Q: Did you ever think of going ba
ck and using your origin al name? 
A: Of the 86 people who were in my  troo
p, I know of three who ch anged Œ who Œ 

who took their old name back. Most of us
 got used to the ne
w names and identities

very quick ly and we Œ we lo
oked upon this, unless we we re attached to the former 
name, unless they were ancient family name
s, or this or that, the motivation to go 
back to the origin
al name didn™t exist for ma ny of us.  
Q: What languages did you speak in 1945? 
A: What name? 

Q: What languages? 

A: What languages. Well, I was b o rn w 
Œ my Œ my  origin al language was the 
Austrian version of German, which incide
ntally has always been a little bone of 
contention between Germans and Austrians. 
Austrians feel that the only correct and 
proper German is spoken in 
Austria,
 and different parts of 
Germany
 mak e the 
same c lai m. 
Hamburg
, for instance, han Œ
 Ha nn ov er
, they think that™s Œ they also 
think that the claims b y  the others ar
e absurd, and Œ and fu
nny. I learnt a little 
French as a small child, we 
had a French teacher, a Mada
me come to the apartment 
and Œ and purportedly teach us
 French, my sister and myself. It didn™t really work, 
didn™t go much beyond
 ﬁFrère Jacques.ﬂ 
And we didn™t really like her; that didn™t 
help. And Œ however, when  Œ in  my  scho
ol system, we took a fir Œ a foreign 
language from the age of 11, and I chos
e French. The teacher who taught Fren ch 
also taught German and was the fore-m
aster of my  class. So he was the 
administrative, disciplinary head
 of that class. And he wa 
Œ turned  out to be one of 
the well known arch-N azis of 
Vienna
. A published author, who wh en the Austrian

writers club, the Pen Club, the Internatio
nal Pen Club, Austrian branch sent a 
telegram to  their Jewish colleagues in 
Germany
 to express their symp athy upon 
their book burning and treatment, there were
 two Austrian authors who refused to 
sign the otherwise unanimous declaration, 
and he was one of them. I got barely  
passing grades in German, which was my  be
st subject, and I switched to the English 
class because of him. Solely because of hi
m. So I had four years of high school 
English and I thought I spoke 
fluent English. That was 
disillusioned fairly quickly 
upon arrival in 
England
, but I could get by fairly well. I learned a little Spanish 
before I left. This was really emigration le
arning other things ty
pe of thing. But I 
don™t think there was enough 
of it to have any impact. 
Q: Where were you on 
V-E 
day, when  victory was declared in
 Euro pe
? 
A: Victory in
 Euro pe.
 I™m trying to think. The Œ the 
Œ strangely perhaps, the impact 
was not enormous on us becaus
e we had felt pretty solidly that we had won, so the Œ 
the fact of the Œ of it becoming official 
was relatively minor. The date, if I recall, 
was May Œ May eight, May eight. At May ei
ght, I believe I was in cadet school in 
England, 
and there was a little bit of razzmata
zz of people celebrating, cheering, 
what have you. And it Œ I think many of th
e cadets thought that 
now they were more 
likely to go to the Orient 
than before. And that conc
erned me only marginally 
because I thought the British would surely
 send me somewhere where my fluent 

German would make sense. I Œ I made so
me  halfhearted efforts to get sent to

Austria
 because that would have intere
sted me, and besides, being to 
Germany
 for 
the first time ever, during the fighti
ng, and I had a distaste for going to 
Germany
. 
Some of our people were there and sort 
of lived it up in  occupation, but didn™t 
attract me. The Œ the Œ the pr
oblem as to Œ who was and who wasn™t a Nazi and so 
on had already co me up wh en Œ 
when we were fighting in 
Germany
. And I was 
told that chances of getting to 
Austria
 were minimal because they were being 
supplied from central Mediterra
nean forces, meaning from 
Italy, 
whereas 
Germany
 was being supplied by pe
rsonnel from north west 
Europe, 
from Œ from 
our end. Th-The Œ the army  has its own 
ways and wh en  it came up, where I did go 
was 
West Africa
.  
Q: Before I have you going to 
West Africa
, can you tell me, in May of 1945, wh at 
was your rank, and what Œ what 
action had you seen during the war. 
A: St-Starting at the beginning, wh en I wa
s in the Pioneer corps, I was a private and 
I saw no chance of ever getting promoted to 
anything, because I was just one of the 
younger lads who was unloading 
trains or testing bridging 
material and so  on. And I 
Œ I wasn't one of the boot polisher and butto
n polishers, so I Œ I wasn't a standout to 
the people on th e parade ground by any 
means. In-In fact, I was a bit of a 
nonconformist 
[indecipherable]
. I was mo re likely to get in trouble about 
something th an I was to get promoted. 
So , wh en I came to the commandos, just 
prior to 
D-Day,
 I was made a lance corporal, which was a big deal. It Œ it™s nothing

really, but as such I was the second in  command of my  detachment, a five man 
team, attached to numb er six comma
ndo, we were number 10 commando at-
attaching teams to eight different commandos for 
D-Day. 
So, I was a lance corporal 
and was subsequently promoted
 to be a corporal in the 
field, which caused a little 
argument because I said to my colleague 
and sergeant, who said, I™m making you a 
corporal and I said, you know, jokingly, want 
me to stitch on an ex
tra stripe here in 
Œ in the front line? And he said, you™re 
damn right. And I said I Œ you Œ you mean 
you have the authority to make me  a paid
 corporal? And he said, who said anything 
about paid? And I came back as a corporal
, largely because one of our detachments 
had been wiped out and I became a one ma
n detachment. When I came back I was 
promoted  to sergeant and 
when  we went out to 
Holland
 and 
Germ any
 again, I was 
a sergeant. And it was then that one of 
our own, who had be
en Œ wh o Œ who had 
become the commanding officer of our detach ments, 
Kurt Gowza
(ph) who served 
under the name of 
James Griffith
, wanted  to send me to cadet school. And I said, 
at this stage, it™s late in  the war, do you 
think it™s worthwhile? And I don™t want to 
do the parade square bashi
ng and Œ and Œ and 
pamphlet bullshitting, I just don™t 
want to do it. And he persua
ded me to do it, with the he
lp of the brigade major, Sir 
Maxwell Hopagow
(ph). He Œ they Œ they li Œ I wanted
 to talk to the brigadier, if Œ 
if Œ if a commission thenhappened in the field, 
Montgomery  
was against 

commissions in the field unless from dire 
need, casualties, because he said it leads

to fraternization through the enlisted men. 
Which we th ought was just fine, and he 
apparently  as a 
[indecipherable]
 thought was in Œ improper. This is sort of regular 
army  smokiness, you know, and Œ and he s Œ 
he stopped quite Œ quite a few of us 
got commissions in the field because they we
re doing a good job. And I Œ I fairly 
likely m-mi ght have gotten one, but when 
I was transferred fro
m one unit to the 
other, I had to start fro m square one to 
build my  reputation of bein g keen and 
determined and willing to do anything and 
so on. Which I did. And it led to the i Œ 
the notion of going to cadet 
school. I went to cadet school, and I mu st say I had a 

ball. The fact that I Œ I m Œ I remember 
arriving and th ere were a whole bunch of 
youngsters out of Œ out of 
school who were going to 
cadet school and th ey were 
studying pamphlets. And th ey ask questio
ns from the pamphlets and I had no idea 

what th-the answers were, b-but I said, I 
don™t know th e name of the plunger of the 
Œ this weapon, but we had a rather speciali
zed  version of that weapon for a special 
operation. Then  suddenly everybody is listeni
ng and they want to know. Well, when 
it came to the tests, the same thing happ
ened . Some Œ some weapon sergeant would 

ask questions and say,
 ask me about the
 Sten
 gun.
 
I said, 
Sten
 gun was not a 
commando weapon, we used 
Thompsons,
 which are a higher quality. And the only 
Sten
 gun I™ve ever seen was one Œ a special 
one fo r an operation with a silencer. He 
said, a Œ a 
Sten
 with a silencer? I™ve never seen 
one. Tell me about it. I said, I™ll 
draw you a picture. And we talked about the 
Sten 
with the silencer for the rest of

the examination. He said, I assume you we
re a weapons instruct
or. I said, I™m not 
supposed  to comment. You aban don your ra
nk when you are a Œ 
a cadet. But some 
lance corporal who was Œ had the job of ta
king the stripes off, relish ed to take a 
sergeants stripes off, you see, so he had sl
ashed the sleeve of my best uniform and 
there were cuts where my stripes had been
. And the weapon instructor sergeant who 
was doing th e testing assumed Œ he could see 
I™d been a sergeant 
by Œ by the cuts on 
my  arm. Well, I Œ I breezed through this
 whole thing like nobody™s business and 
then Œ then came to
 cadet school, and there I wa
s quite determined to be a 
nonconformist and a rebel 
when  nonsense was being 
talked ab out, you know, 
pamphlet stuff, and Œ 
which often is Œ is 
outdated and Œ and Œ an
d has been written, 
who knows for whom, and Œ and I would 
Œ I would say Œ well, for instance a 
question. What use is the 
Bren
 gun carrier? Hands go up and the cadets Œ the cadet 
kept asking questions, you see. And th ey sa
id, to carry out flan
king attacks, and 
somebody else said something else, and 
when it was my turn
, I said none. The 
Bren
 
gun carrier is no use. I ha
ve seen mo re burnt out 
Bren
 gun carriers than Œ th an non-
burned out 
Bren
 gun carriers. It™s a little 
[indecipherable]
 not enough armame nt. 
And I said, it is useful possibly for two th
ings, which is to bring up the tea after 
battle, or if you have nothi
ng and want to fake like yo
u have armor, you run them 
off somewhere where 
nobody can see them
 and the enemy will think you™re coming 
with a lot of tanks, because th
ey make such a racket that 
they inevitably get shot at

and Œ and Œ and then  that™s when they 
burn. And the instructor said, th-that 
Masters
 
is absolutely right, because 
he had just come back from
 Italy
 himself, so he knew 
what I am saying is true, you see? So Œ so
 after awhile I found 
out wasn™t that much 
Œ I mean, I wa Œ it wasn™t working the wa
y I had thought. I Œ I thought I™d be a 
rebel and I found the management agreed w
ith me. Which was in a way, of course, 
a big help  and gratifying and so I graduate
d very high in my  class, and th at™s the 
end of that one. Tha Œ you as
ked me what rank I was when I graduated. I was, of 
course, a second lieutenant and was subseq
uently promoted during my  service in 
Africa
, aut Œ almost automatically  to first li
eutenant and then my  time was up. Six 
years. It was age plus length of service 
in the British army. So my number was up 
and I Œ so mebody wanted me to stay as an 
instructor at the school of infantry and I 
said thank you but no thank 
you. Why not? Well, I said , I n Œ I Œ I Œ I relish the 
illusion of freedom, that I can go wherever I 
want, whenever I want and not be sent. 
I™ve been sent for a number of years now. 
So even bef Œ realizing it™s an illusion, 
enough.  

Q: While you were serving in 
Euro pe
, did you have the opport
unity to visit or to 
see any of the concentrati
on camps or labor camp s? 
A: Never saw one. Some of Œ few of us 
did. This really de
pended on what unit you 
were with, and Œ and Œ and chan ce. And 
you have to bear 
in mind, commandos 
were essentially assault units. And then they Œ th-the Œ th
e people in charge always

stretched what was an initial assault way be
yond our normal role, b ecause we didn't  
have heavy support weapons, 
you know. But th ey had us, 
so they kept us. And if 
you didn™t happen Œ well, it Œ it just so
 happened that no conc
entrat-tration camp 
was in the path of where 
they wanted a Œ a-a-a Œ an assault made. These were 
usually river crossings that they used us 
for, after the Œ the initial lan d ings at Œ on 
D-Day 
or in 
Italy
 or in 
Sicily
 or in  
Holland
. So, one of our people
 of course, as you 
know, heard his parents might be alive in 
Terezin
 and went to Œ to go Œ go get 
them, and succeeded. That was ex
tremely gratifying. None of 
us, the rest of us even 
have the slightest opportunity to do that.  
Q: When  the war in 
Europe 
was over, did you make any 
attempts to find people 
that were left behind in 
Vienna
, wh en you had left? 
A: I didn't understand that. 

Q: When  the war was over, did you make any 
attempts to find any family or friends 
that were left behind in
 Vienna
? 
A: 
Orndorf
(ph), yes. It seemed hopeless the imme
diate family insofar as they have 
not gotten out. We knew that my  Œ my
 Œ my  grandfather was mu rdered in 
Auschwitz
 and we knew that were a number of
 distant relatives had Œ had Œ had 
perished. And other than looking for individu
al friends here and there, and Œ and fi 
Œ si Œ later finding some, not very much fi
nding materialized. There were things like 
getting in  touch again with people who had gone to 
Israel
. Friends. Getting in touch

again with such 
people as my  
kinderfraulein
, my  nanny in Œ in  Œ in  Œ in Œ who had 
been in 
Austria
 throughout the war. In 
fact, we invited her to come and visit in 
London
, and th at was very exciting. So, not mu
ch in the way of Œ of finding people 
that had Œ that had disappe
ared. There were some weir
d things. My Œ my  mo ther 
lived in an 
apartment in 
Lo ndon
 and once went to a ne
ighbor to borrow some 
wrapping paper for a package she had to
 make in a hurry. And the woman said, 
well, I have this one, you can turn it ove
r, it™s used. And on th e reverse side were 
names and addresses of my  father™s ne
phew Œ two of my  father™s nephews in
 New 
York
. Since my parents were divorced, my 
mother never pursued  that. And I tried 
much later to see what I could find it, 
found some people by this un Œ very unusual 
name in Œ in the telephone directory and 
called them up and they said, it™s just a 
name we call our firm, and there™s no one he
re by that name. But, it went off into 
the sand, nothing happened . Of course, 
you know, people still appear nowad ays 
here and there, and that could th eoretically
 happen. My  Œ I Œ I™m Œ I™m still looking 
for some of my classmates and when I came to 
Europe
 I used to read the telephone 
books wherever I was, to se
e what I could find. And sometimes I™d find a name and 
sometimes I™d pursue it and call up for some
 classmate o r other, and not find them 
at home, or in the country or something. 
And it never really led anywhere. If I came 
back a few years later and 
looked in the phone book ag ain, maybe a name was 
missing and I assume d the person died, or 
moved. So it Œ not Œ not Œ not very  mu ch. 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

And by now, anyone older than  I is likely 
to be dead. I mean, purely, technically, 
you know, you Œ I-I™m 76 years 
old. If I start thinking in
 terms of people who were 
older Œ su bstantially older, 86 years old,
 how many are there, you know? So  you Œ 
you find that Œ that some of this is Œ 
is quite Œ quite hopeless. When I was in 
London
 just now, a friend of mine whom I 
haven™t seen since 1940-something, 

actually came from
 Munich
 to spend the day with me and we talked all day long 
about the old times. He was especially g
ood friend. I wo uld never have Œ I would 
never have recognized him 
in Œ in the street, o r 
[indecipherable]
. And Œ but Œ but 
we had so  many common memo ries that ther
e was no shortage of material to talk 
about. 

Q: Before I ask you ab
out your service in 
Africa
, which I will do in a minute, I 
wanted to  ask you, when 
did you realize the full ex
tent of the genocide in
 Europe
? 
A: This is a question I Œ that is very diffi
cult, and I have asked my self that, because 
no Œ many a time still, it™s very
, very hard to answer, b
ecause the fact that people 
were being killed became known almost 
immediately. And by that I mean the 
anschluss
 was in 12
th
 of March 1938. At that time people were arbitrarily arrested. 
The brutality in 
Austria
 was mu ch  mo re immed iate th
an the grad ual tightening of 
the noose in 
Germany
. Wh ich of course was a good thing, ex cept if it happened to 
you. A good thing in that it scared you
 into action, wh ich it didn™t do fo r many 
people in 
Germany
, because it just got a little wo
rse all the time. Well, in 
Austria
 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
August 7, 1998 
 

 
 
14
the brutality was immediate a
nd many people said, le
t™s get out of he
re and Œ a Œ or, 
any border, quick. And not enough people said
 that and Œ and Œ but Œ but those who 
did benefited from that scenar
io. Oh, people were arrested
 and in the beginning one 
asked naiv ely, why were they arrested. 
And then there were some black humor 
jests. They were arrested 
because they had eggs for br
eakfast. You know, the people 
were still joking about this sort of thin
g. And then some of these neighbors or 
friends who had been  arrested, actually we
re released. And so me of them were in 
very poor condition, having been 
beaten and goodne
ss knows what. So 
[indecipherable]
 became aware that people were
 being tortured or beaten. And 
then in some cases one hear
d that the family received 
an urn with ashes, saying, 
shot while trying to escape. 
Well, shot while trying to es
cape. If this was some very 
peaceable neighbor, you know Œ 
knew them well, that th
is was not a man who was 
going to  escape from Œ from benevolent deten
tion. So th ere began to materialize a 
certain awe of, are they co
ming for me, if th ey™re co
ming for me, what will happen 
to me? Are they coming fo
r my relatives? Should one wo
rk more actively on getting 
out, and Œ and so  on. And th is is Œ was a 
gradually increasing image, and I have a 
memory. I haven™t researched this, but I ha
ve a memory that th
ere Œ I went to the 
movies once in
 England
, and there was a movie Œ th ere™s Œ there was a group, you 
know, like the 
Stoogies,
 called The Crazy Gang. Funny 
people in Œ you know, in Œ 
in Œ movie comedians. And the thi
ng was called, The Crazy Gang in a 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
August 7, 1998 
 

 
 
15
Concentration Camp. Now, that™s appalling, 
isn™t it? I mean, I Œ I Œ I suppose in a 
way some of this 
Stalag 17 
series became from a serious film into a 
TV
 series that 
was humorous. It was a comical German an
d y-y-you rememb er that thing? Well, 
The Crazy Gang in the Concen
tration Camp. One should rea
lly try and fish th at out 
and look at it and see how Œ how appallin
g it Œ it might well be. But it shows you 
the scenario that some people who we
re aware of the fact that there are 
concen tration camps thought it was a s
ubject matter for a 
comical film. Now 
[indecipherable]
 seen from this end of Œ of Œ of 
history or time. So, what I™m using 
it for here is to illustrate the unawareness 
of some, how real and how serious it was, 
and yet the awareness of others, 
but Œ but shout it in an ominous 
[indecipherable]
 
of Œ of nothing, behind wh
ich you could not look. And 
that built and built and built 
and built until it became a fu-fu
ll awareness. When, I ca
nnot put a date on that. 
Then  there Œ there were stories, and I do
n™t remember any more whether we heard 
them then or later, of the man who tried 
to make Œ make the Œ the Œ the British awa 
Œ government aware Œ or first of all, trie
d to make his Jewish neig hborhoods in 
Poland 
aware and went from village to village saying
, Juden es brennt
. And 
nobody believed him. 
Q: Can you translate th at for me? 
A: Hm? 

Q: Would you please tr
anslate that for me?

A: Oh, Jews Œ there™s fire, it™s burning. A
nd Œ and this is Œ th
ere were people who 
were lobbying and Œ and trying to communi
cate bec Œ an-and Œ an d Œ and failed, at 
the 
Evian
 Conference, you Œ I™m sure you knew.
 There were good people trying to  
get the government to do so mething. No
w, some govern ments did do so mething. 
The British government passed a bill in 10 
minutes to let 10,000 children come to 
Britain
. The same bill was on the floor of 
Congress and never got off the floor. 
Ulterior motives, indifference,
 take your pick. Politics.  
Q: You did some part of your military service in
 Africa
. Can you tell me what your 
duties and responsibilities were in Œ in
 Africa
 and wh at memo ries you have of that 
part of your service? 
A: Well, first of all, I ha
d an attitude, which said, as

had. Well, the Œ the Œ that Œ th-there in Œ 
in the Œ in the lounge was this great big 
portrait of 
Jan Sobieski
 and I was the only passenger on
 that ship who knew who it 
was. We went to 
Africa
 and the purpose to send us was 
to train native troops as aid 
to civil power. Because the 
British had not yet decided to relinquish the empire. 
And in case they decided to hang onto th
e empire, they need
ed military support, 
ideally from the local 
population, hopefully. Well, we 
didn™t ever say that. What we 
were doing is we were trai
ning native troops to wipe 
out remaining pockets of 
Japanese resistance in remote part s of th
e world. You know, there were Japanese 
soldiers who were holed up on some 
Pacific
 island, I mean, Oriental Œ in the 
Aleutian
 islands, wh erever, and who either ha
dn™t heard that they had surrendered 
20 years previously, or Œ well, at that 
time not 20 years. And every now and again 
one of them would come out. Well, we were training our people to Œ our Œ our 
native 
Ghanaians
 -- before there was a 
Ghana
 
[indecipherable]
 to wipe out these 
pockets of fanatic resistance. But what we were really doing is training them, you 
see, to civil power. And I was greatly he
lped by my attitude, I 
really liked them. 
And they really liked me
. They had nicknames for everybody. I was called 
lieutenant aero-plane driver. 
That was because I wore parachute wings, which Œ for 
which I had qualified, and they  saw wings 
and they th ough wings mu st be an aero-
plane, and what do you do
 with  an aero-plane? You drive it. So I was lieutenant 
aero-plane driver. And I ta
lked to them, which many did not. And found it mo st

instructive, the different ph
iloso phy, just beginning to  be materialistic, but by and 
large, not materialistic. No 
wo rk ethic. Now, you have 
to picture that. We are so 
steeped into our work 
ethic that we say, if you are industrious you will be rewarded. 
They  say, do-do Œ don™t Œ don™t make work
. If things grow by 
themselves, then sow 
them and then go and harvest them, but 
you don™t have to wo rk in  between. 
Q: I™m sorry, I have to in

 This is tape one, side 
B. 
Okay, 
we™re back and you were telling 
me about your experiences in 
Africa
 and you were 
talking about the work ethic. 
A: Yes, well, the Œ the Africans were real
ly just beginning in  Œ i-in that area. I 
mean, the present Œ the Africans would re
sent my  saying some of these things 
because they want to be contemporary, m
odern people. And that™s fine, although 
one can™t help but deplore losing certain 
things. For instance, the most important 
thing to the men was to talk. They would s
it under a shady tree and talk and talk and 
talk. And that was not something that yo
u would say they  are lazy and good for 
nothing. No , they were doing an  important thi
ng, they were talking. It™s true th at Œ 
that that meant more work 
fo r the women, but the tradition of that, I guess is so 
ancient that it Œ it isn™t a thing where you 
had the feeling that there™s going to  be a 
feminist movement saying let the women 
sit and talk, let the men carry the logs.

You know, it is a peculiar Œ a peculiar att
itude that said Œ that admired certain 
things. I can give you some samp le convers
ations that are favorites of mine. That 
the European or American countries is show
ing off too, what they  can perceive to 
be a primitive culture. And so you show th
em a picture of the Gold en Gate bridge. 
And they say mm, fin e bridge. And then co
mes a little noise, that you learn to hear. 
It is ah. It™s just a little 
doubt in the admiratio n. And they say, this bridge, fine 
bridge. What is it for? A very basic 
question. You say well, it™s so people, 
obviously, can get from one side to the other. Ah, of course. Ah, why do the people 
from one side want to  go on the other side
? Well, some  people work on one side 

and live on the other. Ah, ah 
yeah . There™s no work  on the other side. I said, yes, 
there Œ there is work on the other side, but
 some of them Œ and so it goes. And th en 
I say, well, you™re giving me a hard time 
because obviously they are leading me on, 
you see. You build bridges, you have brid
ges for Œ so, I mean, this is just a Œ a 
bigger bridge. Yeah, fine bridge. Ah, ho
w long it take to build this bridge? How 
mu ch did it cost? Well, they have you, you
 know, I mean th-the
 Œ then Œ you now 
would have to demonstrate that it is ec
onomically worthwhile to build all our 
bridges and that it pays, and Œ and Œ and th
at it™s Œ makes mo re sense than Œ and so 
on and so  on and so on and so on. And th
is goes on and now I offer you Œ imagine 
what happened when 
one of the young offi
cers committed suicid
e. British officers. 
Far away from home for the first time, unhap
py, hot climate, who knows? I was the

mentor because I was the one they Œ that 
talked to them. So 
the natives gathered 
around me and said, why? And I said, he 
had Œ he was lonely, 
he had few friends. 
You™re not his friend? I said yes, I tried 
to be his friend, but he was unapproachable, 
I couldn™t get to him. How is he better 
now than he was when  he was lonely? I™m 
getting into theology here or whateve
r, you see, I mean I Œ so I say Œ I 
counterattack. I said, there™s nobody ever
 committed suicide here, your people? 
That caused a huddle and a long discussi
on and then  they came back and said, 
maybe two people Œ no, maybe one lot of 
people, and then  another person. And I 
said, when you mean Œ when  Œ when you sa
y a lot of people Œ well, long time ago, 
the story, king died. King 
had 40 wives. Wives were 
singing pious songs and 
walked into a swamp, to 
accompany the soul of dead 
king. Don™t know whether it™s 
true. Is that suicide? I said, well, I sup
pose so, I don™t know. Wh at™s the other one? 
There was this crazy woman, and some pe
ople say she jump ed 
into a well, deep 
well, died. Some people say some body pu
shed  her into  the well. Some people say 
she fell into the well. But some people say 
jumped into the well. That™s the only one 
we can think of. And I said, well what do
es a person do who is
 very unhappy? You 
ca Œ you can™t tell me  everybody™s happy a
ll the time. O h , he go for bush. That 
means into the jungle. Maybe drink some palm wine. Go to sleep. Wake up, 

everything fine. Not bad. You see? So Œ so  
Œ so I™m Œ I™m Œ I™m literally learning in 

many ways, because we are so assuming thatin our self righteousness that what we

do is absolutely the only way, and in a wa
y it explains that wh
en Œ when  Œ when 
slavery used some of these very places as 
a source, and transpos
ed forcibly people 
who did not have a work ethic and suddenly
 told them they ha
d to wo rk God knows 
what hours, that it was very 
temp ting to  say they are go
od for nothing and lazy. And 
they were not good for not
hing and lazy, we were st
upid. And now all over the 
world everybody™s sins are comin g  home 
to roost. The British empire has fallen 
apart and they are all coming to 
Brita i n
 and Œ and they  used to sneer at the 
United 
States 
for having racial problems
, and they™ve been relativel
y quiet recently. They Œ 
it™s not a question of racial problems, it™s 
[indecipherable]
 at the botto m layer 
objects cheap labor force coming in 
and so on and so on and so on.  
Q: Were you ever asked to serve in 
Palestine
 by either the British army or by 
Jewish Palestinians? 
A: Well, in a word yes. 
Not-Not Œ not Œ not that sp
ecifically. I had a Œ as a 
specialist, and a Œ a fluent 
German speaker trained in th
e German armed forces, my 
last attachment was with all Marine comm
andoes and the colonel, who was a great 
soldier, was quite fond of me and after th
e war we had a drink at the Army -Navy 
club in 
London
. He introduced me to some reti
red Marine genera
l and Œ who Œ who 
told me how fortunate I was that I had the 
honor and privilege to serve with Marines 
Œ Marine co mmandos. And the colonel a-as
ked, what are you doing now? And I 
said, I™m g o ing to art school, because I 
Œ that™s was Œ I was going to be a di Œ

graphic designer. And he said, lord bless my
 soul, whatever for? And I said, I want 
to be a graphic designer. He said, well, if
 you are stuck for anything Œ for something 
to do, I am taking up my  post as inspector general of the 
Palestine
 police, and I Œ 
there™ll alw ays be a job for you. I said, 
thank you very  mu ch sir. And my  mo th er 
had mentioned that to a visiting friend from
 Israel
, my th Œ as a son of my 
grandfather™s partner. And he said Œ she Œ 
she Œ she mentioned the colonel first of 
all, before all this took place. And he 
said he won™t live long. And I said Œ my 
mo ther said, good heavens, why? And he 
said, well we have very Œ engaged in a 
war to shake British domination of Œ of 
Œ of what is promised us under the 
Balfour
 
Declaration. And sh Œ if he is in charge of the 
Palestine
 police then i-is Œ there is 
something very close to total war betw
een us. And so a few days later this 
conversation I had at the Army-Navy club
 was reported to him and he said, he 
should take it. And my mo ther was outrage
d, she said, you just said that the man 
he™d be working with isn™t Œ may not live 
long and now you want my  son to be in 
that position? And he said, it might be very
 useful to have so
mebody in there. And 
my  mo ther said, but you said it™s very dangerous. And he said, dane Œ wh at™s 

dangerous? Walks across 
Piccadilly
 and a tile falls off a roof and kill you. That™s 
dangerous. But Mo ther was not convinced, 
and Œ and i-i-it didn™t happen. Now, it™s 
also true that there were services annua
lly, memorial serv ices, what have you, in 
Westminster Abbey
 and so  on. And my  Œ some of 
my  fr Œ I didn't attend any, 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

23
maybe one, I can™t remember. And a Œ some 
of my friends told me they went to it 
and as they came out there were people on 
either side of the entrance saying psst, 
come here, I want to talk to you. And ap
parently they were 
recruiting. The Œ the 
Israelis were recruiting, that is the Œ the 
Irgun
, or whoever, or the 
Stern
 gang, or I 
Œ I don™t know. And on the other side the Ar
abs were recruiting, because they were 
recruiting for the Arab legion and for wh
at have you. And 
one of the commando 
colonels came to command 
the Arab legion, Brigadier 
Young
, whom I knew well in 
Norm andy
 and Œ and so you see, there were
 both sides, very weird for Œ for 
commandos. I mean, there was a demand for 
trained people. That still goes on in a 
way, because when I ga
ve a book talk in 
Florida,
 a young man came in with a 
Rottweiler
 on a leach Œ leash and I Œ I-I was 
amazed they let him into the 
bookstore, and he said, can Œ do you live in
 this area? And I said no, I™m just here 
for a few days. And he said, that™s too bad,
 and I said why? And he said, I belong to  
a group th at is very interested in comma
ndo training. So  you see, there are jobs 
everywhere.  
Q: Did you ever consider the 
possibility of Œ of going to 
Palestine
? 
A: I first heard about it when I was maybe ei
ght or nine years old, or maybe a little 
younger. We had a game where you had to  
pick a nation, you represented that 
nation. And then wh en that nation was ca
lled you had to pick 
up the ball and hit 
somebody with it. You know, throw at th
em. And there was one boy who always

said, Palest inian. It was Jewish boy. A
nd I Œ I mu st have asked him, why do you 
want to be a Palestinian? A
nd he said, that™s the countr
y of our future. Obviously a 
Œ from a Zionist family. And I said why? And 
he said Œ he explained it to me as best 
as a young child could. And I was extr
emely puzzled, because we were so 
integrated into Viennese middle class soci
ety, that the reaction would have Œ was 
why would we go and sit in the desert and 
become a part of some agrarian society 
when we are in an intellectual society here and part of 
[indeciphera ble]
. And so it 
took quite awhile to underst
and wh at this was all about. And of co urse, a lot Œ a lot 

of the most material co ntribution ca-came from 
Hitler
, where people suddenly 
realized that however integrated the Œ an
d accepted or honore
d they thought they 
were, that didn't count any mo re. So, the 
notion of living there didn™t really occur 
until relatively recently when it™s part of a 
very broad overall att
itude of mind that I 
have felt that I could live anywhere and 
Œ an d relish living anywhere and become 
part of living anywhere. And I™ve Œ I™ve only been to 
Israel
 once, and it was 
absolutely wonderful, and 
if I haven™t recently gone back, it™s largely because I 
have ma Œ we have discovere
d some distant relatives who want to take over if we 

go there, and we are a little afraid of th
at because we™d rather be our own Œ 
determine on our own where we want to go, 
what we want to do. And th at may be 

difficult. But we™ll Œ we™ll go again. And 
we have many friends and Œ and Œ and

some family. So I Œ I™m Œ I™m not an Œ I 
Œ I™m Œ I™m pro-Zionist, but not an Œ an 
active person likely to make 
aliyah 
next week. 
Q: I™d like to ti Œ try and get a time frame. 
When did you leave the contin ent and go 
back to 
England 
for cadet school? 
A: And go where? 

Q: To cadet school. 

A: We had just crossed the line, which I be
lieve was in middle or late March, I have 
the date, of course, in my  b
ook, in ™45. And I Œ I was then sent to cadet school and 
that would ch Œ check out with 
V-E 
day in May, it™s a three months course, all 
right? So  you have 45 Œ spring
 of ™45 cadet school gradua
ting perhaps in early June.  
Q: And when were you in 
Africa
? When did you get ther
e and how long did you 
stay? 

A: Six months. And shortly after 
that Œ I mean, I went first to 
Colchester 
in 
Essex.
 
I-I had hoped by the choice of my regiment
 and because I gra
duated high, you get 
your first choice to get to 
Oxfo rd
, because I chose to be commissioned in th e 
Oxfo rdshire
 and 
Bu ckinghamsh ire 
light infantry. And I made mistake. They 
didn't  send me to 
Cowley 
Barracks in 
Oxfo rd,
 they sent me to 
Colchester
 
[indecipherable]
 city, but brimful of soldiers. I was in para Œ in a barracks where 
there were three light infantry regiments.
 Each one had a different drill, totally 
different drill. So that if you were orderly 
officer, which you were often, as a ju nior 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
August 7, 1998 
 

 
 
26
officer, you had to get the orderly sergean
t, who was usually an
 old hand, and put 
coins on the table. This half crown is me , this florin is you, this sixpence is the 
bugler, these are the ranks. And now, th
ere were no wo rd s of command, it was all 
done silently and precisely and we marc
hed together for 12 paces and halt. We 
about face, we do this, we do that, we 
[indecipherable]
 bugle Œ bugles and 
[indecipherable]
. And the town would ga
ther around th e parade square, they  would 
know it better than I did, certainly. Ther e was, for instance, no ceremonial march 
past for the 
Oxfo rdshire
 and 
Bu ckinghamsh ire
. It was a bubble past, being light 
infantry, so you ran 12 abreast at the bubble
, in step, in line and you were the officer 
out in front saluting the pedestal where th
e co mmanding officer stands. And if they 
don™t look lined up properly or in  step
 properly, it™s your fault, although you 
haven™t the slightest influence wh at™s happe
ning behind you. I al
so discovered that 
Œ so I had to learn three different drills. 
I also discovered th
at the Œ one of the 
reasons I had chosen the Œ the 
Ox
 and 
Bucks
 is because their airborne battalion had 
taken the bridges on 
D-Day
 and we linked up with them, and they  had done a 
beautiful job taking these bridge intact. A
nd they were delighted to  see us, and we 
them. It turned out they we
re persona non grata in thei
r own regiment, because the 
regulars at the base considered them
 irregular forces, 
air landing people 
[indecipherable]
 pilots, parachutists, what have y
ou, as I was, you see? So the ones 
with the maroon beret of th
e airborne were looked at as
kance, and me with a green 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
August 7, 1998 
 

 
 
27
beret is even worse. And I Œ I couldn™t wa
it to get out of there, which I managed 
first of all to be sent to the school of
 infantry , and that was a course, comp any 
commanders course. And th at™s when the majo
r there said didn™t I want to stay as 
an instructor, because we h
it it off perfectly. It was the 
same principal as the cadet 
school, I was telling them how it was and th
ey agreed, because they were veterans 
from this campaign or that. And I turned 
it down for the illusion of freedom that I 
described to you. Well, after that,
 West Africa
 and happy to get out of this place 
where the people seemed to have the a
ttitude that these irregular force pe Œ 
memb ers were coming to take their jobs away 
[indecipherable]
 headquarters and 
God, I would have paid not to take it aw
ay, you know? I Œ I Œ I wa Œ I wanted  out, 
out. It™s terrible. And Œ and I™m delighted th
at my  last six mont
hs were this extra 
boon of Œ of Œ of Œ of 
Africa
 and the preceding course. All were lovely comp ared to 
being at the base. 
Q: What marketable skills did you have 
at the end of your military service? 
A: Ha, what marketable skills. I had strong 
cartoons in the army, and I had an older 
mentor who was a stage designer. And he ad
vised me what to do with my cartoons, 
which he liked very mu ch. And I had an  interview with  
ﬁPunch.ﬂ
 He said, you start 
at the top. I said, you mean at the bottom? 
He said no, at the top. If you can™t hack 
it, you go down  one rung. Wisdom. Well, th
ey bought two id eas for cartoons and I 
was so rich that I couldn™t believe it. 
But this is before the commandos and the 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

28
Pioneer corps. I-I got paid like for seve
ral months salary for two ideas. And I 
thought this is a lovely way of making 
a living. These were 
not political cartoons, 
they were like 
ﬁNew Yorkerﬂ 
type cartoons. And I drew a
nother batch and I said I 
would th row a party fo r the whole platoon, 
and th e Œ nothing seemed to happen and 

then a terrible thing. Well, I went to 
the local pub wh ere I was well known and I 
said, I-I mu st give this party. I have a whole batch of cartoons out there and when 

they come in I™ll have plenty of money 
and right now I don™t.
 And they gave me 
credit and I threw a party, all the beer yo
u can drink fo r the whole platoon. And the 
check hadn™t come yet, th-the 
second installment, but afte
r the party, I think one or 
two days later, it came saying th e editor regret
s at this time we 
are not buying any 
of the cartoons. And now I had absolutely 
six months to pay it off, you see. And I 
didn™t draw a cartoon fo r a year and a half, 
in utter depression. 
Now, I still thought 
that in that direction was my  Œ my  Œ my  future profession. I came out of the army  

and I made one brief attempt. I talked to 
a friend of my  family™s who was a Œ a s Œ 
journalist. And she wrote th
ings about resorts who then  gave her a limousine, and 
you know the bit. One of my daughters sa
ys it™s half a step from prostitution, not 
journalism,  but that™s a matter of t Œ pe
rsonal taste. Anyhow, I asked her, do you 
think there would be some opening as an
 apprentice journalist somewhere? And she 
said no, comp letely hopeless. You might 
sell one story about your war experien ce, 
maybe, but doesn ™t amount to much, everyb
ody has stories. And I gave up. She™s

still writing a Œ a Austrian cooking co
lumn for a Jewish magazine in 
London
, very 
popular. Written several books, still going to a
ll the best resorts. Well, I thought Œ I 
Œ I Œ I wrote her a note when  my  Œ when  my  book came out, and th e movie rights 
were bought. I haven™t heard from her si
nce. Anyhow, I gave up and I decided 
reluctantly I would have to 
go to school. So, my  mento
r, who had sent me with the 
cartoons, you know, to 
ﬁPunch,ﬂ
 he said, I have a young woman friend who has 
just graduated from art school, and she said
 she would be willing to come and meet 
with you and advise you wh ich school to 
go to  and so on. So we met in his studio 
and she 
[indecipherable]
 sort of snippety, brisk you
ng woman, and she said, I went 
to the Central School of Art and Crafts, it™s
 Œ I consider it the best school. It™s very 
hard to get in and you probably  won™t.
 And sh Œ I Œ I Œ I said, you Œ you™ve 
graduated from there? Yes, she had graduated from there, and she was a German 

refugee and she had been pres
ident of the student union, an elective office. Not bad 
for a Œ for a refugee. Well, I was th is 
commando first lieutenant, you see, and I 
decided to  go to  that school and become pr
esident of the student union, as a ma tter 
of Œ point of hono
r, you see? And I did both. I Œ 
I daresay my jingling uniform 
helped a bit to boost my po
rtfolio, but it Œ they accepte
d me and I went to that 
school and I learned quite a lot. And after 
three years, my mother
 drew my attention 
to a middle paragraph in a 
paper that talked about 
Fulbright 
scholarships. And she 
said, wouldn™t a graduate year be very be
neficial for your career? Well, I had just 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

30
begun to go and look for jobs and I found 
th ey paid nothing and wanted me to do 
things that I was not willing to do. I Œ I Œ 
I asked one studio where I went for a job, 
what would I have to show you that you 
would hire me? And they  produced an  
extremely realistic painting of a plate of 
bacon and eggs, wi-with fat bubble in the 
center, and very real. And that™s an illu
strator, you know, I 
mean, I Œ obviously 
whoever was talking to me didn™t understa
nd where I came from or didn™t care. 
Anyway, I Œ I said to myself, I shall neve
r be able to do this and what™s more I 
don™t want to be able to do that. I™m 
a problem solver, I™m a designer, I Œ I™m a Œ 
and for that they were willi
ng to pay, I think, three p
ounds a week starting salary, 
and I Œ I thought that that was absolutely
 horrible. And I welcomed the opportunity 
to apply for the scholarship, for the 
Fulbright.
 And I did with full support of the 
principal of the school, a Œ a Œ a Scottish 
painter who was not my
 friends because as 
president of the student union, you can im
agine we had many, many skirmishes. But 
he said, 
America
 is entering what we entered in th
e first Elizabethan age, culturally, 
and you must go there. And o-off I went an
d they threw in a summer scholarship at 
Yale
, six weeks. And money was a problem, 
because sterling was not converted Œ 
not that I had any. But i-it Œ it created a problem, because most art schools are not 
board ing schools. So I had to live somewher
e. So I lived at In
ternational House in 
New York, 
in the cheapest room in the basement, and developed techniques, how to  
eat for little or nothing. I was 
also helpedby the 
fact that my mother had a couple of

cousins where I was in vited to dinner once
 a week and th ey™d  give me sandwiches 
for the next couple of days. And th en I™d 
buy a box of cereal and I™d buy a loaf of 
bread. And I couldn™t afford the school ca
feteria, but I could 
buy 20 cents worth of 
bologna or cheese, and that would stretch 
for a couple of meal
s with my loaf of 
bread. And as to Œ and Œ and 
a carton of milk, which I put
 on the windowsill to Œ to 
keep cool. A-And Œ and I discovered the Am
erican luxury, there™
s free sugar in the 
cafeteria, where you can help 
yourself, put a couple of pa
ckages in your Œ in your 
pocket and with my  box of cereal I had br
eakfast every mo rning, and my  carton of 
milk, you know. And it Œ it worked . And I 
started to freelance. There was a woman 
who did 
[indecipherable]
 greeting cards, and I did th
e finished drawings. Making 
the bells on the wedding cards nice and ov
al, the polka dots round. And listening to  
these Œ the radio programs of the day,
 like the trace of lost persons, the 
FBI
 and 
peace and war. I got a whole education. An
d I worked there so me nights a week. 
And then  the father of a schoolmate of mine from 
Vienna
 had a business of 
embroidering blouses, women™s blouses. And he
 Œ he paid for these designs, lots of 
money. And he didn™t want 
them finished, he wanted th em on tracing paper so he 
could trace them onto the blouses. Now I em
ployed my best friend to help me, we 
had so many to do. Unfortunately we disc
overed it late in th
e year, but we could 
actually afford to go to the movies, which 
we hadn™t been able to do before. Was a 
sensational year at International House. 
We put on shows. And if I give you the

cast, let me say that one of our fellow students was 
Leontyne Price
. So we had the 
best show in  town, and a bu
nch of Hawaiian friends wh ich 
[indecipherable]
 
sometimes still in touch, who 
were musicians. Was lovely. 
Q: When did you come to the 
United States? 
What year was that? 
A: ™49, I believe, if I™m not mistaken. I can 
verify that, but I think that™s right. For a 
year. And Œ and Œ and there is the story I Œ 
I once mentioned to y
ou, which I think is 
very wor Œ well worth saying. My ow Œ my 
own attitude was I could not live in this 
country, because I™d 
just been through six years of 
war against discrimination and I 
was seeing the newspapers and 
wh at have you that din Œ di
n Œ discrimination in this 
country was rampant. I Œ I Œ I read the Œ 
th e anti-Semitic diatribes of Œ of Œ on the 
hill, of 
[indecipherable]
 and Œ and Father 
Coughlin
(ph) all this was not unfamiliar 
to me, but then the discrimination against 
black people seemed totally intolerable. 
And a couple of things happened . I arrived on the Queen
 Mary
 on my 
Fulbright
, 
and there was a green uniformed customs o
fficial who looked at my  papers and Œ 
and looked at my Œ my suitcas
e, my shipping trunk, wh at
ever I had brought, and he 
said, how long do you propose 
to stay here? And I said, oh I don™t know, I have a Œ 
a year™s Œ I mean, a sch ool year™s sc
holarship, preceded 
by six weeks in 
Yale. 
And I 
might hitchhike around a bit to
 see some of t h e country. So, it™ll be a year, or Œ or 
maybe 18 months at the mo st. And he sa
id no. And I said, I Œ I beg your pardon? 
And this great big, red-haired Irishman, 
you see Œ I said, you mean I can™t do th at?

And to my  utter amazement he put his ar
m around my  shoulder and he said, young 
man, this is the country to
 live. And we Œ we need young people to come here, and 
you don™t want to go back af
ter 18 months. And I was co
mpletely floored by this, 
because I had seen cust
oms officials in Œ in 
Austria
, in 
Germany, 
in 
France
, in 
Britain
, and never had anyone said a fre Œ a Œ 
a friendly word. It wasn™t fashionable 
until that time. Now they say welcome to th
e country or somethi
ng, but this is all 
the last few years, you know. To me, th
is was absolutely 
stunning. I™ve never 
forgotten it.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Peter Masters
. This is tape number two, side
 A,
 
and you were telling me about coming to 
this country  on wh at you thought was 
going to  be a temporary excu rsion and yo
ur Œ your enco unter with a customs 
officer. 
A: Well, the Œ the s Œ the next thing that 
made a tremendous impression was in this 
six week course a-a-at 
Yale
, which was for students 20-odd students from different 
countries all over the world 
who were coming to Œ to  study fo r year, and this was 
sort of a conditioning, Ameri
can studies, you know, so th
ey would not get too much 
of a culture shock because 
university here was different
 from university in their 
own countries. And there were courses 
in Œ in politics and in English and in

literature and so  forth. And one of them
 was in sociology. The professor was a 
professor by the name of 
Serge
(ph )  
Ya ma ki
(ph), a Finnish Americ an, young man 
who was wo nderful. I had never had a profes
sor like that. He told
 it how it is, talked 
straight. He talked about religion in  this 
country. He said there are statistics about 
how many people go to church. I assure you 
a percentage, or a large percentage of 
the Œ the majority of people going to chur
ch  Œ to various churches, doesn ™t matter 
which, are going to  show th eir Sunday clothes,
 or their automobiles, or whatever. It 
becomes a social thing. It 
has very little to do with relig
ion. We had a 
course Œ oh, 
oh and he talked about discrimination and 
about what mu st have been the first 
seedlings of the Civil Rights mo vement. An d he said, this is an uphill struggle, it™ll 

take a while, but it™s moving along. We ar
e correcting. There are Œ there are serious 
attempts to correct the wrongs of the pa
st. And he went into detail saying wh at 
people were doing an d what was going on 
and so on. And you had not heard about 
that in 
Euro pe
, you only heard about 
the negative stories. So I became aware that 
somebody was trying to  do something. And th
at was Œ that Œ I™d perhaps been  hasty 
when  I said I could never live in a country 
wh ere these things exist, as long as there 
were forces at work that were trying to 
counteract the Œ the Œ the bad things I had 
heard. Well then circumstances o v ertook me. 
I Œ I met my wife again, after we had 
known each other in 
London
, in fact we had been double
 dating, but not a-as each 
other™s partner. And she went to 
America
 when the Czech government in exile 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

35
collapsed because of 
the Czech coup in 
Prague, 
the communist coup, and she was 
not going to  go back  to 
Prague
 under the communists. So
, she had help
ed out the 
second world meeting of the Intern a
tional Monetary Fund which was in 
Lo ndo n
, 
and sh-sh-she was o-on loan to them fro
m th e Czech government be Œ just before 
the coup. And th ey offered her a job in  
America
 and sh e said, I am very happy 
here, and when the Czech government co
llapsed, somebody remembered the Œ her 
job offer and he Œ he Œ he
 restated it and she accepte
d. So she came what she 
thought was for a year
 to work for the 
Monetary Fund in 
Washington
, and she 
worked there for 36 years.
 And I came and Œ to the 
United Sta tes 
and one day Œ 
there was a Greek student in Internati
onal House who said, I™m hitchhiking to  
Washin gton,
 anybody want to come? I sa
id, I know somebody in 
Wa sh ing t on ,
 let 
me try and get to a telephone. Well, I trie
d and Œ and th ey told me that the Un ited 
Nations were in 
Flushing Meadows, New York
, and I said yes, but a branch, and I 
got a Russian operator and forget it, I 
could not convin ce her that there was any 
United Nations here, which of co urse th
ere was, the World Bank and Monetary 
Fund, and a couple of other one. I gave up
. So  did the Greek chap, by th e way. Said, 
ah, I™m not going. So that was Œ I Œ I™d 
looked for telephone listings under her 
name, there was none. Anyway , I Œ I just ga
ve up. I Œ a short wh ile later she went 
on home leave, which was 
London
, although she is from 
Slovakia
. Ka Œ children™s 
transport survivor. And my Œ 
our mu tual friends gave her 
a book that had just come

out, ﬁ
The Green Beretﬂ
 by
 Hilary Saint
 
George Sa unders.
 It was the first book 
about the commandos by a historian.
 And they  said, bring that to
 Peter.
 And she 
said, where? He™s in 
New York
. Really? I™m going through 
New York
, I™ll bring it 
to him. She did and I said I tried to come and see you in 
Washin gton, 
told her the 
story. Sh e said, you Œ you mu st come and see 
Washin gton.
 So I hitchhiked to  
Washin gton,
 which if you had a straight ride to
ok seven and a half hours, befo re 
everything. Before Œ before the bridge, be
fo re the parkway, be
fore the tunnel in 
Baltimore.
 And I then developed the habit of h
itchhiking after school on Friday  to 
Washin gton
 and we got engaged and in th e spri
ng of 1950 we were married. And I 
could now stay under Œ as the family me mb er of a 
U.N.
 employee, and wo rk . And I 
got job in 
Washin gton
 and I™ve been here ever since. 
Q: In what ways was it significant to y
ou th at your wife was also a survivor? 
A: It was like a homecoming. I had been  e
ngaged to a Œ a Œ an Irish Protestant girl 
who was as liberal as the day is long and as
 bright as can be, and th at, howev er, did 
not include her family. Her father was a co
lonel and he was the Œ one of the leading 
heart specialists in Œ in 
Ireland
. And he wer Œ had 
been a colonel at 
[indecipherable] 
the African Œ north African campai
gn. He was actually in on the 
concen tration camp reparations in 
Europe
. And you would have th ought that that 
might impact him in some way, and it di 
Œ it certainly impacted him, but the Œ the 
notion of his daughter marrying 
a foreigner, a Jew, an artist, all bad. You see, so the 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
August 7, 1998 
 

 
 
37
Œ the mother was also a doctor, a research
. The young woman herself, her father 
was a professor at 
Queens
 in 
Belfast.
 She went to 
Trinity
 in
 Dublin
, which is, of 
course, Catholic. And so, we 
did a lot of commu ting between 
Dublin
 and 
Belfast
 
and I got s Œ deeply into th
e Irish problem, so similar 
to the Israeli problem, so 
similar to so many of the other disc
riminatory problems. And found th Œ 
intellectuals or not, there was no reasoning
 with the people. They believed every 
atrocity story. They told me
 the same atrocity  stories north and south, with a change 
of characters. And Œ and th e young people we
re generally against that. But they had 
a tremendous uphill struggle. 
Anyway, the mother, 
the researcher doctor said do not 
tell Dad that you are getting engaged, becau
se it will kill him. In defense of this 
absurd attitude, let me tell you that my ow
n family was not lagging far behind. And 
my mother™s eagerness to get 
me on that graduate year to 
America
 was without a 
doubt largely motivated by Œ 
sh e was even willing to not be  near me i-in order to 
save me fro m a fate worse than death in Œ 
in her Œ in her view. And Œ and so Œ so  
what Œ what can I say to you? It is a Œ 
an amazing thing. I have never found out 
what happened to th is young woman, who 
was certainly complete
ly innocent of Œ of 
anything that took place. And fo r awhile 
I was in Œ in agony to make a decision 
what I would do with my lif
e before I decided to marry my wife, whom I admire 
tremendously as the child survivor of her 
entire fami ly. The thre
e children were the 
only surv ivors, everybody else was mu rder
ed. And so you do what you feel you

mu st do. And I as Œ mu st say I Œ we™ve ha
d an absolutely marv
elous marriage. With 
the millennium it™ll be our gol
den wedding anniversary. An
d ma Œ the secret recipe 
is respect and admiration. 
Q: I would like to ask you mo re about 
Eng land
 after the war, and then we™ll go 
back to the 
United States 
in a mo ment. Did you experi
ence any other anti-Semitism 
in 
England
 after the war? 
A: Not really, not really. I would say we 
had a mixed bag of friends, some refugees, 
Germany
 and
 Austria
 and 
Hungary
 and so on. And quite a few British people. 
You see, I™ve been several people in my  
life. I™ve been a student, so I had art 
student friends. I had Œ some of whom beca
me very famous artists. I had been  a Œ a 
Œ a soldier, not only with ot
her foreigners, but with Br
itish colleagues. When I was 
in 
London
 just now, one of my friends 
from cadet school, who was a fellow 
commander with wh om I™d actually done a night patrol in 
No rma ndy
, w i th ou t u s  
realizing it until we told each
 other the stories, that we
 obviously were both on the 
same thing, in cadet school 
we were very close friends, a
nd he is as English as they 
make them, and he came to see me up from 
Essex
, where he now lives. And we said 
we™ll have lunch in a pub, and a drink. And he told me that it was his 75
th
 birthday. 
And I said how c Œ ho
w could you leave your
 fami ly on your 75
th
 birthday? And he 
said, I told 
Peggy 
I Œ I w Œ I wanted to do this. And 
he said, you don™t realize it, but 
on my  50
th
 birthday I happened to
 be visiting you in 
Wash ington. 
And on my 21
st
 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

39
birthday we were both in 
Norm andy
. So I thought it appropri
ate. He also brought 
me a thing he had written about his 
D-Day 
experience. It is extremely moving. It 
was his father™s birthday, 
D-Day.
 And wh en it was over, 
D-Day
 night, he said, I felt 
Œ I suddenly reflected that I was very gr
ateful not to have spoiled my father™s 
birthday by becoming a casualty. So, I Œ I Œ I think his 
D-Day
 account is brilliant. 
He writes as I wish I could, and he in turn
, has read Œ read my 
book and he said to 
me Œ he wrote me a letter and he said, I™v
e read your book, and 
you™re not supposed  
to enjoy a book about such 
grim times and experiences. But you and I know that in 

between the grim times and experiences, we
 had some wonderful times. So forget 
what I said about Œ I really enjoyed your 
book, because it™s like you were there, I 
mean, when you read it. And so 
is his. And he says, you know, 
D-Day
 wasn™t so 
bad fo r us comp ared to what we experien
ced in the next few days afterwards, and 
that™s true. But in describing his 
D-Day
, he tells me where Œ you see, he was Œ he 
had a disadvantage over me. He was surrou
nded by all the people with whom he 
had trained. I was one of me attached topeople I barely knew. A training mistake, 

they should have put me with
 them earlier. But, when 
they were killed, I didn™t 
know them. When his buddies 
were killed, and one was like shot in half crossing a 
road in front of him, these were his frie
nds. So it was much more personal for him, 
a-and I respect that, I mean I Œ I never sa
w one of my immediate friends killed or 
wounded. I saw a lot of people killed or
 wounded, but not my immediate friends. 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

40
They were attached to the un
it next door, as Œ a specialist as I was, to  this. So it Œ it 
made a-an emotional difference that was 
to my  advantage. I mean, I was shocked 
enough when I heard that tw
o ch aps down  the road wh om I knew very well had Œ 
had just been killed, you know, and 
so  on. I don™t see them. And I was 
Tommy
 gun 
guard  for a burial party that buried, I don™
t know, 40 people. I 
didn™t know any of 
them. So it Œ it Œ you know, these are all f
actors in this thing, it™s a very, very 
personal the experiences.  
Q: You were in 
England
 during th e 
Nuremberg
 trials and during the 
U.N.
 vote on 
the partition of 
Palestine
, and I would like you to  talk 
about both of 
those even ts, 
starting first please with the Œ 

A: Both  of which? The 
Nuremberg
 trials Œ  
Q: 
Nuremberg
 trials and then also the 
U.N.
 vote on the partition of
 Palestine. 
A: Oh yes, yes. 
Q: First, if you would,
 please tell me about
 Nuremberg
, and did you ever think 
about possibly going over and working as
 a translator or an interpreter? 
A: No, no, I never had the opportunity
, nobody asked me. It didn™t happen. I 
followed it closely and Œ and relished th
e just punishments of some of the 
participants. I also was aware that many people were given immunity for Œ for 

reasons of practicality of Œ of 
[indecipherable]
 scientists who were needed and 
goodness knows wh at else. It did not i
nvolve me personally. I now welcome the 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

41
notion th at Œ that 
Palestine
 Œ that Œ that 
Israel
 came  into existence, and I have 
mentioned to you before my 
Scottish principal with whom 
I used to skirmish in art 
school, and I remember that I was in hi
s office when th e assassination of Count 
Bernadotte
 came th-through Œ the news came 
through. And I said, I™m shocked 
about that, one should not k
ill United Nations officials. I-I think that™s beyond the 
pale. And he said, to my utter amazement, 
these are the birth pains of a new nation, 
and you have to accept it, that 
this is the sort of thing,
 we don™t know the details. 
And later of course, I heard that 
Bernadotte
 was targeted because he was assuming 
a stance of a very unfavorable 
[indecipherable]
 and so on and so  on. Bu t I was 
amazed that this Scotsman had the vision to
 s Œ way beyond mine, that this was a 
thing you had to take into 
your stride. Anti-Semitism, w h
ich is coming back to early 
Christian, didn™t affect, but you have to 
bear in mind that all our chaps had cover 

stories and many of them found the 
[indecipherable]
 of that cover story was 

comfortable, and so they didn't say who 
th ey were. Many of them didn™t practice 
any religion particularly, and when it cam
e to  intermarriage, all of us were 
independent enough to say if I want 
marry an Eskimo, I will. Metaphorically 
speaking, quite a few married Eskimos, wh
ich some of them came to regret. But 
that doesn™t alter the fact that on princi
ple, you felt, I™m my  own person, I can do 
what I like. Now comes the question which 
is probably down 
your list somewhere, 
of Œ of h-how mu ch  did Judaism mean? It™s 
very difficult. On the one hand, some of 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
August 7, 1998 
 

 
 
42
us had a reaction, saying I don™t want 
to belong to anything that excludes 
somebody. That™s a very broad statement, 
but Œ but i-it™s meant to be. I don™t want 
to belong to a Jewish club. That means 
only Jews can join, because that is the 
exclusion of somebody and that™s what we 
were just fighting against. I don™t want 
to belong to another club either, that include Œ excludes people. In fact, I don™t want 

[indecipherable]
. But it goes beyond that, because you say, if I send my  children to 
Sunday school, or th ey belong to a club,
 I don™t want to join any clubs. Clubs 
segregate. That™s not always reasonable, bu t that™s an emotional reaction to some of 

the things that have happened 
befo re. So you see, we did not send in our children to 
Œ to Sunday school. I had two daughters an
d a son. We had the so n, the son was 
Bar Mitzvahed
. The girls were not 
Bat Mitzvahed 
because we hadn™t even heard 
of that in
 Europe.
 The son was 
Bar Mitzvahed. 
Wh en he was born he did not have 
a bris, he was circumcised in the hospital.
 It™s again the emotional reaction against 
belonging to  something that excludes other 
people. It™s quite absurd if you reflect 
upon it, and it™s taken me years to Œ to Œ to
 overcome it. But Œ but it was a very real 
factor, possibly an error, socially, possibly 
an error religiously, because parallel to 
that are the war memories of going to shul
 with my grandfather, who was very, very 
serious about it, as my parents were not. 
And th e tug of war between the sentiment 
an Œ of emotional tradition on the one 
hand, and the not wanting to belong to  
anything that excludes anybody else is 
an ongoing thing. Ri
ght now I™m deeply

43
embroiled in a fight that I find myself in, ra
th er surprisingly. It is that the members 
of my  troop of Œ of fo reign refugees, want
 to put up a memo rial to the troop an d the 
20 who were killed in north 
Wa les
 where we were trained. This is all initiated by 
my  book, where it suddenly has sort of come
 to Œ come alive, and a retired judge 
who was one of us, refugee from 
Germany
, has taken the ball and is running with it 
like crazy, and the people in north
 Wales
 think that the movie will be made in Œ in 
north  
Wa les
, which of course doesn™t follow. 
But Œ so  the local council and the 
council of 
Wales
 is all in favor and has give
n us a lovely little green plot 
overlooking the ocean in this resort 
town, where they are going to put up a 
memorial. And when they draf
ted the words, it said, refu gees from Nazi oppression. 
It did not use the word Jewish. And I™m up 
in arms, and I say it has to include the 
word  at least mo stly Jewish. And in  orde
r to bring this about, I am fighting tooth 
and nail, I™m Œ I™m enlisting the support
 of my surviving colleagues or their 
widows. I sought an interv
iew with the Honorable 
Miriam
 
Rothschild
, who was 
married to one of our chaps and is a wea
lthy ma Œ scientist in her 90™s. And she 
said, you mu st come down and talk about
 it, and I just now I went to the 
Rothschild
 
estate and we spent all day ta
lking and she is solidly on 
my  side. And th e Œ the thing 
that™s happening is that some of the ch
aps who have embraced their cover story, 
don™t want to break that cover story. 
It is as if they
 thought that the
 York
 massacre, 
of wh ich they have never heard, happened  
last year rather than hundred s of years

ago, and that by assuming the Œ their id
entities as British c
itizens church of 
England
, which is what our dog tags said, 
they are escaping any danger of anti-
Semitism and they have forgo
tten who they really are. Or rather, they would like to 
forget. No t all of them. Some of the non-Je
wish memb ers of the troop, there is a Œ a 
Œ a fellow, he is now in his 80s, 
friend of mine, who Œ whose name is 
Gizer
(ph), he 
served under the name of 
Gord on
. He is a grandson of 
Walter Liebknecht

(ph) was the buddy and comp anion of 
Ro sa Luxemburg, 
if that 
means anything to you, early German
 communism. His father, the son of 
Wa lter 
Liebknecht
(ph)
 Œ Walter Liebknecht
(ph) was assassinated by forerunners of the 
Nazis in the 20s. There is a 
Käthe Kollwitz
 woodcut, a gorgeous wo odcu t of the Œ 
the body of 
Walter Liebknecht
(ph) and mourners. She was 
very much involved in 
that, 
Käthe Kollwitz.
 Well, the grandson of 
Walter Liebknecht
(ph), not Jewish, 
said there is not a drop of Jewish club in
 Œ blood in me, but I respect, applaud and 
salute my  Jewish comrades and their brav
ery and I am on your side that it should 
say mo stly Jewish on th e mo nument. Another one, 
Ron Gilbert Goodman
, he 
served in undercover intelligence in 
Germany
 after his command of duty. He got 
an 
MBE
, Member of the British Empire in Œ 
from Œ from the queen, and he said Œ 
he maintained his cover longer than any
body, because he had 
to. He was Œ he was 
catching Nazis, you see. Post-war Nazis.
 And he said Œ it was a bit embarrassing 
because he™s Œ he™s widowed, his girlfriend 
wanted to read the 
book and he thought

well, that will break my cover as far as sh
e™s concerned.But wh
ile he Œ they were 
discussing it, she got it from 
Amazon
 dot co m
 
and read it and Œ and he said, the hell 
with the cover, I™m on your side. He rememb ers that he was forced to destroy his 
shul, by the Nazis. So you see, for the judg
e, it™s probably very  difficult to go to the 
Welsh council and say, on reflection, it 
ought to say mostly Jewish. And I don™t 
know wh ether he™s ma n enough to do it. But if he isn™t, I™ll withdraw my  support. 
That™s how that one is.  
Q: I wanted to get clarific
ation on your cover 
story and something that you told  me 
in the course of the interview so far. Wh
en you were offered 
the possible job as a 
policeman in 
Palestine Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ did the man who offered you that job 
know th e truth, that your Œ your real 
identity? 

A: I doubt it. I Œ I think Œ I mean, as a colonel, somebody might have said these 
peculiar chaps we are giving you here 
are German speakers. But I mean, the 
brigadier, Lord 
Lovett
(ph) until he was woun
ded, had some very early members of 
the forerunner of the two who I think were Sudeten Germans. Now, well a Œ we 

didn™t know them, they were killed at 
Dieppe
 on Œ in the raid. They  might have 
been Sudeten German Jews. No idea. Didn™
t know them, I don™
t know their real 
names. But he was very fond of referring to
 all of us as good Germans, you see?

Sudeten Germans. He didn™t
 understand what that mean
t, really. Scottish highland 
chief, you know, head of the 
[indecipherable]
, the 17
th
 Lord
 Lovett
(ph). He Œ he 
doesn ™t understand what Œ wh
o Œ who Œ who we are, a
lthough he subsequently 
apparently  did. I just Œ in 
Scotland 
I talked to the widow of
 the brigade major, Lady 
Hopagow
(ph) and she was full of Œ of Œ of Œ 
brimful of Holo caust stories and Œ and 
Œ and saying how Œ how supportive shewas and so on. But, the Honorab le 
Miriam 
Rothschild
 tells me th at when
 she was in north 
Wa les,
 first as the fiancée of one of 
our people, the landlady said she did not wish her to come again, because she didn™t 
want a Jewish person in her house. And th
en she said two other things happen ed. 
One was that Lord 
Rothschild
 was in 
MI-5 
in British Intelligence, counter-
Intelligence, and he told her that
 somebody had accused her in 
Wa les 
to be 
probably  a spy, and that they had actua
lly searched her belo
ngings. And she said, 
how could th ey? And sh Œ he
 Œ he actually cited exampl
es of a crossword puzzle 
she had been wo rking on, that 
MI-5 
knew had Œ had been ex
tracted from her room. 
And wh en she Œ ou-our man, of course, wa
s under his cover story, the one who was 
engaged to  her, so he coul
dn™t say anything in partic
ular. And when they were 
married, th ey kicked him out 
too. So, for that reason she 
was against that memo rial 
and I said to her, I™m much more confro
ntational than you are. If there was a 
manifestation as you describe, of anti-
Semitism, the more reason to have a

47
memo rial there saying mo stly Jewish, so
 that, you know, what™s wrong with that? 
And she agreed with me. 
Q: And the gentleman who told  you ab out 
the birth pains of a 
new nation, did he 
also know your true background? 

A: The answer is, I don™t know. I simp ly d
on™t know. He was an autocrat and we Œ 
we Œ we fought quite a bit because of 
various school matt
ers. And Œ but he 
respected me and I respected him in Œ in
-in Œ in our stubbornness. And what he 
knew, I really don™t know. I told  you so me of my  fellow students became very 
famous. I tried to talk one of them out of
 his career because he wanted to be a 
scenic designer and I said, there™s no fu ture 
in that field. And he almo st changed his 
major, but then he stayed a 
scenic designer. He is now one of the mo st famous ones 
in the world. He has, I think, a 
CBE 
from the queen and he is work ing. We couldn™t 
meet because he was doing an 
amphitheater in the south of 
France
. And he called 
me and we had a long chat. An
d then he is going to ho Œ 
Peking
, and th en he is 
going to 
Ho ng  Ko ng
 and then  he is going to 
Kuala Lumpur
 and in  between he is 
doing ﬁ
Midsummer Night™s Dreamﬂ
 in 
Copenhagen. 
In Œ he was doing 
ﬁ
Nabucco,ﬂ
 which is a Jewish 
Verdi
 opera, I mean, Jewish subject about 
Nebuchadnezzar
 and what have you, and 
the Jews in the south of 
France
, in the 
hotbed of French neo-Nazism. And so  he 
had, in an amphith eater, which makes it 
more difficult, he projected a Star of 
David
 over the amphitheate
r. And at first it 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

was going to  be durin g the famous 
Nabucco
 chorus of the Œ of the Jews. And then 
he said, in reflection, after reflection, I™d
 like to make a political statement. So I 
want it from the beginning of the overtur
e, through the firs
t act, the Star of 
David
 
projected onto the 
entire amphitheater. 
Q: I™m sorry to interrupt you, but I 
have to change the tape. One moment. 
[break]
 
This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holo caust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with
 Peter Masters. 
This is tape number two, side
 B, 
and you 
were telling me about the scenic designer, but you have not mentioned his name. 
A: His name is 
Ralph Koltai
. He Œ he was material in the 
Sydney 
Opera House 
design, etcetera, etcetera. And he is Œ when
 Œ when I Œ when I 
relinquished my year 
as president of the student union, he was my  vice president and fo llowed me as 

president of the student union. He is from 
Berlin
, Hungarian Jewish family. And I-I 
first noticed how famous he 
was when  I saw a play in 
Washin gton
 where the 
program notes said that the s
cenic designer was a student of 
Ralph Koltai™s. 
So  
that, I suppose means you have arrived. He is sending me a book, he had a big 

retrospective recently, and 
I am sending him my book, 
so we are exchanging Œ 
exchanging books. I™m very thrilled and he is
 very, very enthused 
about the fact that 
I wrote my book.  

Q: I wanted to ask you to reflect upon wh
at was going on in your head and wh at 
was going on around yo
u during the conflict 
over the partition of 
Palestine
 and then

ultimately the declaration of
 independence and statehood. For you, as a Jewish 
refugee, what was going on in your mind in 
England
 in those days? 
A: Well, as I have really explained wh en
 I talked to you ab
out my conversations 
with Mr. 
Johnson
 Œ I didn™t mention his name either, 
W illiam Johnson
 was the 
Scottish painter who was the principal of my 
school. He must be long dead. I Œ a-at 
first abhorred the violence, and it took 
me awhile to Œ to
 settle into the 
understanding th at he had ahead of me. I 
Œ I could not at first fathom that oh, 
blowing up the King
 David
 hotel was a good thing to do, you see. Difficult. I Œ I-I 
respect his explanatio n that he gave, sayi
ng the birth pangs of 
a nation, you see. 
But, at first it was very difficult to grasp 
that the average Œ I mean, you have to  bear 
in mind, you™re a British soldier and you ar
e assigned to this. Now, I have a friend 
who was in the Pioneer corps with me, his name is 
Peter Bloch
(ph). He is fro m 
Germany
, a refugee, Jewish refugee. He 
volunteered and he got into the 21
st
 
independent parachute compan
y, which was Œ had some 
foreigners in it, British 
parachute co mp any. He found himself in 
Greece
, fighting civilians, political 
civilians and he hated it. It
 Œ it ma Œ pushed him wa Œ 
way over left politically and 
then he was assigned to 
Palestine
 with the six Œ with the 
first airborne division. 
And he said, I don™t want to go. And th ey
 said, well, what do you mean? You are a 
war hero, you™re Œ he said, I Œ I Œ I Œ 
you can call me what you will. I may have 
been a war hero in 
your eyes, but now I™m a conscien
tious objector. And I think he

managed that, conscientious 
objection not to serve with
 the first airb orne in Œ 
British first airborne in what was 
Palestine.
 And surely you can
 understand it. I 
can™t understand that it threw him, but I 
can understand but I don™t agree that it 
made him go way over to the left when  he studied  at the 
[indecipherable]
 school of 
economics and we used to have arguments
 about that. And I think he has settled 
down more or less as a liberal. But a Œ a Œ 
a Œ in Œ in his youth 
certainly the people 
he was hanging out with were Œ were a mi
xed bag of people wh
o were reading the 
ﬁDaily Workerﬂ
 in the 
Lo ndo n
 underground demonstratively, and I reme mb er 
hearing th em comp lain saying I wish they ™d give us a new one, I™m getting fed up 
holding this paper all the time. But it™s 
done for demonstrative purposes, you see. 
The Œ well, the whole communism question, 
of course had s Œ got into the act in 
that when  Œ when  
Stalin  
did so me of the things he did, he became unacceptable, 
and the people who had been
 supportive of Œ of Œ of communism sudden ly found 
themselves in a rather aw
kward position, because how do you backtrack when  
you™ve been  such an  enthusiast? And 
suddenly you™re Œ you™re Œ the people you 
have been fo llowing are comm
itting atrocities that you cannot Œ cannot accept. So, I 
Œ I never Œ I never got into that communist
 game as so many y
oung students did. I 
suppose it was a question of
 upbringing, because afte
r losing World War I, for 
which many Jewish Austrians were great en
thusiasts, they Œ th
ey  su dd en ly  fou n d  
that war is hell. Meaning th e depression 
following it, meaning defeat, meaning the

51
peculiar post-war Œ post World 
War I dealings, politically, where 
Austria
 was 
completely emaciated to a six million 
country from being a world empire. And 
peculiarly 
Germany
, which was the much younger 
country, something like 2,000 
years of 
Austria
 compared to 90 years of 
Germany
. 
Germany
 was intact and more 
powerful than ever after Œ well, not econom
ically, but Œ but territorially. So, you 
hear of Germans yearning for a return to 
power. You ga Œ you do Œ never hear of 
Austrians yearning for a retu
rn to power, because they were made up of so many 
minorities, that wanted to be torn apart. 
Which you see again in
 what used to be 
Yugoslavia
. Every minority wants to be independent, whether they are viable or 
not. First independence, then maybe we™ll co
nfederate. I™ll believe
 it when I see it. 
Terrible. 
Q: Is there anything else 
that you would like to add ab
out your years in postw ar 
England
? 
A: My years in postwar 
England
 were primarily as a student. I had a Œ a wonderful 
time. I had Œ there was no 
G.I.
 bill, but there was a so-called further education and 
training grant, which was mo re mo dest than the 
G.I.
 bill, but it certainly sustained 
me together with my freel
ance activities. And I had my
 Œ my own apartment in 
southwest 
London
, and I traveled  mo stly by bicycle, and by underground. And I 
had lots of friends Wartime friends, En
glish friends, English friends from cadet 
school. I had some with whom I corre
sponded for years afterwards and the

52
correspondence only ended beca
use they died. I had a br
illiant friend who wrote me 
sheafs
 of letters, all not about news, but ab
out philoso phical observations. I have 
kept them all. I Œ I find that Œ well, the Latin proverb, 
Ubi bene
 
ibi patria
. Where 
I™m well, there is my co
untry, applies to some
 extent. I could live in
 England 
easily, but I could live anywhere unless the 
system of the countr
y were such that I 
could not stomach it. I have a reluctance to 
visit countries in my  travels where there 
is the juxtaposition of luxurious wealth and 
abject poverty, which has kept me away 
from 
China
, from 
India 
and many other countries. I-It
 is perhaps a Œ a Œ a Œ an 
ostrich policy of simply not wanting to see 
it, but I find it distressing. I would say it 
includes 
Mex i co
. I™ve been to 
Mexico
 once to a Club Med and I don™t think I™ll go 
there again. I-It™s not my thing. I 
Œ I don™t know, I find that postwar 
England
, I Œ I 
Œ I never really worked in 
Eng land
, other than on a farm as a boy, which did me a 
lot of good, and briefly on 
being released from intern
me nt Œ I did not go from 
internment into the army, I 
went from internment to being released, forgotten out 
momentarily, and then into
 the army, when I was old 
enough. I Œ I worked for a 
Polish publisher, and I was nothing. I mean
, I was a gopher. And I have therefore, 
no work experience in 
England
 that could be called a wo
rk experience. The Œ the 
thing about the bacon and eggs picture tu
rned me off rather
 solidly. Whether I 
would have gotten in to my  
profession, I would imagine 
I would. I don™t know how 
it would have wo rked . I™m Œ I can™t, I rea
lly don™t know. In this
 country there was a

certain realization, that if you have any tale
nts at all, there is 
someone somewhere to 
whom those talents are worth money, and th
ey are willing to pay 
for it. They might 
be willing to pay as little as possible, but
 on the other hand, if you are reasonably 
alert and if you are willing to go where it™s 
at Œ which is someth
ing that almost no 
other country seems to  have. I mean, I can™t
 picture people doing wh at people in 
this country have been  doing for a couple
 of generations, that is the economic 
situation in our to wn  is bad, so we put 
everybody in th e car and drive to a state 
where I understand you can get 
a job. People ga Œ actually
 do that. They don™t do it 
elsewhere. And mo st of all, I realize that
 in this country , if something bothers you 
and you are willing to spend 
some time trying to remedy it Œ it needn™t be a very 
political thing, it can be the bumps on the st reet, or Œ or the speed limit, or whether 
your school needs an addition. You don™t have to Œ to Œ to
 give up your job to Œ to 
pursu e this. You work on in a little bit and th
en get together with a few people who 

are like-mi nded. And in  your own lifetime Œ 
even in Œ within th
e next few years, 
something actually starts to happen. Sometim
es too fast. I come back to the bumps 
where they Œ they wa
nt the bumps in, then now they
 want the bumps out. And wh en 
they™re out they will want th em in again. You know, I 
mean, and Œ and Œ and that 
actually happens, at great expense and with  
a big effort. But you try and do th at in 
some other country, and you know what™s
 gonna happen? Noth ing is gonna happen. 

Maybe it™s changing a little, sl
owly now, and there are th
ings happening here and

there. But by and large, you run your head 
up against a wall, and the wall, the base 
of the wall is littered with 
the bleached bones of people 
who have tried before you, 
and some of them were good people, 
but they failed. Well, that™s a big 
discourag ement to run your head  against th
e wall. I have participated in some of 
these things in this country . Got an add ition built at the elementary school where 
my children went, which actually came into
 use while the youngest one was still 
there. You know, I me an, unheard of in Œ 
in Œ in other countries. Doesn™t Œ doesn™t 
happen, doesn™t happen. So  I find it enormo
usly refreshing, and you can take some 
of the other things in your stride a little b
it if youknow that on 
the other hand, this 
exists. 
Q: Let™s go back to the 1950
s and now you are living in th e 
United States.
 I would 
like to get a sense of what was happening 
in your life, now you™re newly married 
and you are now in the 
Washin gton, D.C. 
area. What was happening to you 
professionally and pers
onally in  the 1950s? 
A: I first g Œ my  Œ my  wife arranged th
at I should see a man who was himself a n Œ 
a German refugee, and he re Œ had a sma
ll public relations agency, that was a new 
profession. And he wo
uld steer me to where I might get a job as a graphic designer. 
Well, I went to see him, and he decided to
 employ me. In some Œ in many respects 
that was a disaster. It was a very small fi
rm, of mo re heads than employees. And the 
attitude was rather peculiar. I was now the ar
t director and the art department all in

one, and we didn™t have many jobs to do. 
Through family connections he got an 
assignment where I Œ where there were to
 be free full page, full color ads in 
ﬁEsquireﬂ 
magazine. I had never do
ne anything like it, and neither had an ybody 
else there. So it was my assignment. I 
not only  designed th
em, I wrote them, I 
supervised the photography, I went into 
unbelievable acrobatics. And they came 
out, for those times, pretty well. One of 
the partners suggeste
d that I be given a 
bonus, because I think I earned 30 dollars aweek. The big boss said, he is an artist 
and he had the fun of doing 
it, it™s a bad idea to give him a bonus. And th ey didn™t. 
This kind of attitude made it 
a little difficult. I-It was in 
everything. I mean, if we 
did get money fo r this, there™s no doubt we 
did, he would buy a new oriental rug for 

the office. And I designed a shiny 
brass name plate for downstairs on 
[indecipherable]
 street where we were Œ had a Œ 
had a upstairs o
ffice with a three-
dimensional logo wh ich I had 
designed in the Œ custom made in brass. I mean, we 
were really going fo r it, and everybody ha
d their own hand-engraved business card, 
and Œ wh ich we really couldn™
t afford, you know? And Œ a
nd the Œ well, we went to 
a meeting for Œ with  Œ with 
some corporate association, and I discovered the thing I 
mentioned elsewhere in Œ in other connec
tions, and that is that nobody was saying 
anything, and we were to sell these people 
on why we wanted to
 do this. So I spoke 
up and I said, here™s what we need to do. 
We actually did a broc
hure for them. That 
was unprecedented, and Œ and i-it wouldn™t ha
ve happened if I hadn™t sold them on

56
the concep t, because it was way out modern
 for them at th at time, you know. Well, 
ultimately everybody quit, an
d I was the sole employee. The boss took a job with 
the government and said, don™t ever call me
 there unless there™s an  utter emergency. 
And then he said, I see here an advertisem
ent that the Pentagon is Œ wants to retain 
an agent, an advertising ag
ency for the army. So why 
don™t you go and bid on that. 
Me. And I said, you know, tha-that™s a bit 
ab surd, because they 
are looking for a big 
corporation to handle this. Never mind,
 you do as you™re told. I went to the 
Pentagon and to  this room full of col
onels and what have 
you and advertising 
agencies from all over the country. And th
e colonel who made the opening speech 
said any firm whose business would be do
ubled by this account is disqualified. 
Obviously it didn™t want sm
all time people. I knew my boss so I stayed til the end 
of the talk and I came back and I said
, we are disqualified because of this 
stipulation. And he said w
hy? And I said, because if yo
ur business is doubled. He 
said, well, it would do mu ch 
mo re than double our business, so we are all right. And 
he was absolutely ser-serious, you see. So I 
Œ I Œ he filled out the forms, I filled out 
the forms and he sent them in. I was sti
ll the only employee. After awhile there was 
Œ the door rang one day Œ door
bell rang and it was a team to evaluate our facilities. 
That was rather difficult for me, b u t I ha
d been trained to improvise, and I said 
several people are on assignment with 
[indecipherable]
 and several people are on 
vacation, and right at this mo ment I am th
e only person here just 
for this next hour

or so. Would you rather come back anothe
r time, or what? And they said, perhaps 
we should. And there were lots of empty de
sks and th e place was very elegant, with 
the oriental rug and all the other stuff. And 
they left, and I called 
the boss at work in 
government. I told you never to call me. I sa
id, well, I think this is an emergency. 
These guys might come back any time, I Œ th
ey Œ they  don™t Œ I tried to pin them 
down , but they said they come for ra
ndom inspection. And he said, I™m coming 
over. And he came and he said, you know, in 
Œ we Œ we have to do something. And 
he said, I just crossed 
Lafayette 
Park. We could take some of the bums from the 
benches, and some of them are your si
ze and some of them are mine, and could 
dress them up and sh  Œ have 
them Œ give them a shave an
d they could be sitting at 
the desks wh en these pe Œ if Œ if only we
 knew when they ar
e coming again. I Œ I 
said, you know, I Œ I don™t think th at that™ll work . He was deadly serious. Well, a 
short while later, he had the account of an
 African nation, and who was doing it? I. 
We had a newsletter. I had ab solutely no ma
terial for the newsletter, but I went to 
the ambassador and interviewed him, and I we
nt to look at the postage stamps of the 
country, and there Œ there were some an
imals that were indigenous only to that 

country, so I went to the z
oo and talked to the director 
about whether he had any of 
these specimen, and he did, and I had a phot
ographer and I took pictures in the zoo, 
and pictures of the stamps and I got a co
ngratulatory letter fro
m a philatelist at the 
Smithsonia n
 saying I wish mo re people were 
doing this. He didn™t know I was

doing it out of desperation, you see.And th en the boss was invited for the 
inauguration of the president in that count
ry , and he went, and 
was decorated. And I 
said, be sure to keep me in
formed so I can write the news
letter that shou
ld get to the 
guests before they go Œ all go home. And he 
said he would, and he sent me nothing. 
And I was getting progressively more desperat
e because I felt duty-bound to do this 
and I called his wife. And I said, is he writi
ng to you? And she said yes. I said, can I 
see the letters? She said no
, they are rather private. 
I said, cross out the private 
things and Œ and I Œ I have
 to have something of wh at™s going on. Didn't get 
anything. I finally took Œ fished out account
s of the first inauguration. This was a 
re-inauguration of a second term presiden
t, and I wrote as if somebody had been 
there, and if it described the Œ th e women™s 
dresses in general terms, I described the 
women™s dresses in general terms. And I Œ 
I Œ I just winged the whole thing and Œ 

and showed pictures of the previous ina
uguration. And I had it all just about done, 

with each story on one desk 
and now all I had to do is
 assemble it, and he came 
back and he said, the place is
 in an awful mess. And I sa
id mess? The mess is each 
desk, since nobody sits at the desks, it™s one story. It™s perfectly organized, I Œ it™s 

the only way I can get this thing out in tim
e. And he said, first we™re going to  get 
the place shipshape. I said, yo
u touch one of these stories,
 I Œ I™m o u t of here. He 
touched the stories, and I quit. And then he wanted to pay me to come back to put 

out the issue, and so I Œ but I mean, for 
the swan song, but I 
wa Œ you know, there

was simp ly no way. So I called all the peop
le who had quit before, half a dozen and 
one of them was working for channel nine
 television. And he said, how would you 
like to be a television art director? I sa
id, well there™s one catch, I know nothing 
about television. He said, neither does an
ybody else, it™s new. Why don™t you come 
on out, I can™t promise anything, but we™ll 
see. I went out and I was television art 
director, and it was lots of fun. Pioneers,
 you know. Never before. Live television. 
We did fantastic things. We had mo re cour
ag e than good sense. 
We Œ we Œ we did 
spectacular things, we
 got Œ and being 
Wa shington
 we did network things, and I-I 
did presidential broadcasts for several presid
ents, some at the Wh
ite House, some in 
the studio. I Œ then Œ then 
CBS
 did a survey  and discover
ed that the country was 
read for country music. 
I think the survey meant 
Simon
 and
 Ga rfunkel
, but they 
didn™t understand that, and so we got 
Jimmy Dean.
 And we did th e 
Jimmy Dean
 
show, network, and I had a ball. I had a fre
e hand to do wh at I like. I did a netw ork 

musical ev ery week. It meant not sleepi
ng for one night, work ing clean acro Œ 
around th e clock. And for couple of adjacen
t night, if we got home by tw o or three 
in the morning, we were doing well. 
And I decided I had to make a move 
financially, so I went to the management, wh
ich was as autocratic as they come, and 
I said, you are not charging enough for my
 services. That was the approach . And 
they said, how much sh
ould we be charging? I said, well
 first of all, I™d like to have 
a percentage, like all th e other talent is ge
tting. Oh really, how 
much do you have in

mind? So I Œ my  wife and I had a long se
ssion over the weekend, because if I said 
the right amount, they  would cut it in half. 
If I said too mu ch they would laugh and 
fire me. If I said not enough, they would acc ept it. So I had to say too much, but just 
enough too much that by cu
tting it back it would be reas
onable. And that actually 
work ed. And it was based on th
e premise that the role of 
Washin gton
 television 
would increase. I was much more optimistic
 than they were, and I was right. The 
trouble was when  I didn™t get any sleep 
any mo re, I couldn™t Œ didn™t have time to 
bill, so that my bills were accumulations
 of several weeks. And that meant the 
check was large, and that meant th e pers
on who had to  sign th e check was signing a 
check that was bigger than hi
s. It wasn™t really bigger than his, but it was by the fact 
that it was several weeks. And that irked th em. So after a period of time, they said, 

we are going to terminate this agreemen
t. And I said, and wh at? And they said, 
we™ll Œ we™ll see that you are all right. Well,
 seeing that was Œ I was all right was a 
ludicrous joke co mp ared to wh at I™d been
 earning. So  I said, I don™t know whether 
that is acceptable. So they 
said, do you want to see th
e president, whom we could 
never see. I met him in the elevator and 
usually told him what Œ what Œ what I Œ 
what I needed and he would su pport me, 
because I was an asset. This time they 
were waiting. You want to see the presiden
t? Sure. I walked in and he was Œ you 
know, it was the days of having no desk 
and a long settee and he was sitting on the 
armrest with his feet up on the settee and sa
id, sit down. I was sitting 12 foot away 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

61
on th e long settee. And he said, can we help
 you to relocate? And I said, I Œ I think 
I™ll manage. And in the meantime they 
offered my assistant, who was Afro-

American, my job at half the salary. And 
he quit and we formed a partnership, and 
we freelanced for Œ after 10 years, for channe
l nine, really doing, if I say so myself, 
an excellent bloody job. We were way ahea
d of people, right to the right and left. 
Some of them even called us and said, you are giving us a hard time, you are doing 

such fascinating things that our management
 is constantly on us. We freelanced for 
another five years, as you 
know, a design partnership. 
Now, we did work for the 
other networks. We did the 
[indecipherable]
 orbital launch fo r 
ABC
, we did the 
inaugural coverage for 
ABC
. We are Œ we had been  
CBS. 
They had Œ they  
deliberately prevented us from doing freelance
 for a few years, out of sheer malice. 
Ultimately we got into a difficult situation 
because my partner Œ 
we were doing a Œ 
a fashion show at the 
Mayflower
 with 
Lyndon Johnson™s 
daughters. And we were 
build ing a Œ a Œ a walk way and sets and this was in 
Herndon, Virginia 
and I™d 
work ed th ere all day and I was getting very  tired, and I said, can you come out and 

finish up, and he said sure. And as he wa
lked into the shop wh
ere we were building 
things, a guy hit a knot on a four by four 
[indecipherable]
 his lathe, and a piece 
flew off like a shell an d hit him Œ hit my
 partner over the head and he had a 
fractured skull. And he didn't 
want to be hospitalized in 
Virginia
 in those days. So 
he got on the phone and a
rranged for his ambulance 
and hospitalization in the

district where his sist er  was a nurse for 
a neurosurgeon. And he said, I Œ I have a 
fractured skull, can you co
me an d g et me? It ™ s n ear 
Dulles
 airport, th-they took an 
hour befo re he was in that hospital. And 
they put in a metal plate and Œ and I found 
him a lawyer, and he got enough insuranc
e compensation to buy
 a couple houses on 
Capitol Hill
. And talking about anti-Semitism, or
 anti-black or anti anything, my 
art director colleagues in 
Wash ington
 would sometimes take me aside and say, we 
respect what a courageous 
thing you are doing. And I 
said, what am I doing? And 
they said, you have a black partner. And I 
said, it™s not because I™m courag eous, we 
work  well togeth er. And they would say ye
s, but it can™t be easy. I say, it™s no 
problem at all, we have Œ we have always
 worked  together where we could wo rk on 
one piece of rush work where I start on the 
right and he starts on the left and we 
meet in the middle and it looks like one piec
e. What mo re could you want? See? So 
that was still even in the 
creative arts a Œ a Œ a fact that p eople respected me for 
doing th is. And reversely, I advertised for 
an assistant and one of my  friends and 
colleagues called up and said, we lost one 
big account, so we have to lay off a 
couple of designers. We highly recommend so 
and so. He is Jewish, but he™s a very 
nice guy. But he is a very nice guy. I hired 
him, but that still went on, you see, and 
that™s in the liberal arts. So 
maybe that™s why my  friends in 
England
 want to duck 
out from the words on the mo nument.

A: Well, it doesn ™t exist any more, although 
the boss still is there, an d Œ and I™m not

Today is September 25
th

are continuing from an intervie
w that was begun on August 7
th
 of 1998, this is now 
September 25

, 1998. This is tape three, side
 A.
 Okay , can you hear me now Mr.
 
Masters? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You had been telling me about five 
years of freelance work after 10 years 

work ing with 
CBS.
  
A: This 
Washington CBS
 station, wh ich was, at one
 time, owned and operated by 
ﬁ
The Washington Post
,ﬂ
 
but it was also 
Washington™s
 
CBS
 station and we did 
originate it
, Washington 
being 
Washin gton
, presidential broadcasts and so forth. 
And I did 
[indeciphera ble]
 I did some at the White
 House with President 
Eisenhower
, subsequently with  President 
Kennedy
. We did a great big show at 
the Œ at the 
Sheraton
 Park Hotel, which was called,
 Dinner with the President, 
seven cameras, prime time, with 
Kenned y
 in  attendance and 
Johnson 
in 
attendance, and a cast of stars. 
Josh White, Hanya Ho lm  
ballet, the 
CBS
 
symphony orchestra. 
Robert Preston
 was the 
MC
, th e movie actor who did, you 
know, ﬁ
76 Trombo nes,ﬂ
 etcetera. And 
Josh Œ 
I said 
Josh White
, the folk singer. 
The 
Clancy 
brothers. These were big names at the time, and 
Judy Collins
 and Œ

and I did a lot of id Œ scenery and had to
 build a stage because
 they didn™t have 
one. And had to build dressing rooms down
stairs. And that was quite Œ quite an 
exciting project, I enjoyed it thor
oughly. I rememb
er President 
Kennedy
 sitting 
there at the table facing th
e stage when his alarm went off. His Œ his wristwatch 
alarm to tell him that he had to Œ only 
so much more time to
 Œ to stay. And he 
made some  joke about it, he was very qu
ick with things like that. He was very 
funny. Very, very ni
ce event, very warm hearted.
 I remember they had written 
things especially for him. There™
s an old American song called, 
ﬁWe Want No 
Irish Here,ﬂ
 wh ich was, you know, prejudice ag
ainst the Irish immigrants. And 
they sang that facetiously, and lots of f
un. Well done, great success. So I Œ I af Œ 
you want to know what happened  afterwar
ds in Œ after my television years, I 
freelanced for the other networks. I did the six orbital flight fo r 
ABC
. There was 
some scenery and some background material. I did inauguration of
 Kenned y
 fo r
 
ABC
, when it snowed so hard, we had gr
eat problems because it was almost 
impossible to get to the capital. O n  the 
way the truck broke do
wn , and we had to 
get this show on the air. So we Œ we had 
a little pickup truck with
 Œ with Œ to Œ to 
build  the booth at the stand facing the 
inau guration platform. And we called the 
American Automobile Associat
ion to  help us, and th ey sa
id, we can™t help anyone 
who is not blocking traffic on the Œ on the 
parade route Œ on the route. So we said, 
thank you very much. And th
ere were three of us in 
that pickup truck, my

66
construction man and his assistant and I. An
d we pushed the tr
uck to where it was 
blocking traffic in the inauguration rout
e because we Œ we obviously had to  get 
there. And without making another phone call, a roving 
AAA
 service truck got us 
started and we Œ in Œ in the snow, and we
 made it to the capital. The next near 
disaster was that the moistu
re of the snow that was me
lting on top of the flimsily 
constructed booth was leaking in to the boo
th and short circuiting the cameras. And 
Œ and w Œ I mean, we an Œ we knew we wo
uld short circuit the cameras. Well, I Œ 
when  you™re a television art director, one 
thing you know how to
 do is where to 
get help quickly and who is reliable to co
me through an d so on. I mean it Œ this 
was in the days of live television, i-it mi
ght be the sort of thing where somebody 
wanted to  have a sailboat in the studio 
in th e two hours a
nd you would find one 
and get one into the studio in
 tw o hours. I once had a ta
xi pick up a chestnut man, 
you know, who Œ in the stre
et, with his little oven, roas
ting Œ there was only one in 
Washin gton
, in 
New York
 they used to be on ev ery 
corner in the winter. And I 
knew wh ere he was and we need ed  him for a live show, and I had a taxi pull up 

next to him and offer him, 
I think 10 bucks if he came
. And h-he did, and they  
loaded his whole paraphern alia, the hot st
ove and we had him in the studio, you 
know. That™s how we used to do th ings
. Well, I knew a Œ a construction Œ a Œ a 
roofing person in Œ in Œ in Œ in  
Virginia
, and I got him out in the snow to  get Œ 
fight his way through to the capital to lay 
that stuff on top of th
e booth to keep the

water out. And in those days
 we were not pooled bu
t this Œ we Œ I was doing 
ABC
, 
and the people I had Œ used to
 work  with was ceeb Œ from
 CBS 
were next door in 
the next booth. And I went over to a 
man with whom I™d had many skirmishes 
because I felt that the Œ th
e Œ what shall I say, the 
Œ the good of the country 
preceded our little professional skir
mishes. And I said to him, 
Bill,
 your cameras 
are going to short out. And he said, oh my
 God, I™m sure you™re right. What can I 
do? And I said, I have an Œ I happen to
 have a roofing guy co me who is laying 
insulation on top of my booth, I™ll have
 him lay some on top of your booth if 
you™re willing to pay him for what he is 
doing. He™s Œ he won™t charge you much. 
And he was so grateful, you know, and 
I™m sure that that kept him Œ kept 
CBS
 on 
the air for the coverage of the 
Kennedy 
inauguration. When  it was over somebody 
stole all the furniture, even 
though to get to the booth, 
you had to get up a ladder. 
You know, it was a Œ a rather improvi
sed arrangement, a Œ a plywood nailed 
together to make a platform and so on. 
And so mehow they managed to unlo ad that 
furniture during the night 
fo llowing th e inauguration. And wasn™t mu ch furn iture, 
but it was a desk and whatever, you know, 
for the newscasters a chair and a rug, 
and it was gone. Those were the exciting days of live television, I don™t think it 
quite goes on th at way now. Was really w
onderful. After that I did some shows for 
the 
United States 
Information Agency, 
ITV, 
and my  assistant Œ my  Œ my  partner 
and I did a number of shows for them which 
were seen all over the world, they had 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

an English learning thing th at we-went in
ternational and was probably seen by 
mo re people than any television show ever 
se Œ as a series. And we tried to give 
them Œ whe-when  we came they looked ra
ther amateurish and Œ and we were 
retained to do a Œ a f Œ a couple of seas
ons, I believe, of thei Œ all their shows, 
internationally seen. And we tried to make
 them look like network television, and 
I think we did. Politically Œ when I say 
politically, I mean professional politically, 
it was rough going. Very, very difficult to
 deal, because Œ to deal with these 
people, because television 
and Œ and Œ and governmen
t don™t mix easily. The 
bureaucracy is too Œ too slow, too comp
lex, and too Œ frequently too f Œ too 
unreasonable to do things that Œ th at need
 simp le and quick solu tions and Œ and w-
we Œ we managed it as best we could, bu
t it was not altogeth er a happy Œ a happy 
situation. They would say, fo
r instance, we have Œ we ne
ed to hire additional help, 
and we haven™t got the go
vernment slots, so why don™t you hire them under 
contract? And th at™s not altogether prope
r, but again, it Œ abso
lutely necessary at 
times, you Œ you Œ you can™t get Œ if you ca
n™t get the work  done, you can™t get on 
the air, and if you Œ a deadline is a deadline 
and so  forth. And s Œ then you have to 
make, as an outsider, decisions whether you wa
nt to do this if Œ if it Œ if you can 
see its urgency. And then, very frequently
, you don™t get the backup it requires to 
continue doing it. Like they 
would say, we have a pers
on we Œ whom we want you 
to hire and you hire that pe
rson and recognize that this is
 a big mistake, but you™re 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
69
stuck in an in-between situation. I-It™s not
 Œ it™s not altogether a Œ you Œ you really 
have to walk a tightrope of Œ of consta
nt difficult professional ethical decisions 
how you handle this, recognizing that 
the need  on the one hand, downright 
patriotic need in Œ in the case of Œ I mean
, they Œ they  say they
™re not Œ they™re not 
a ministry of propaganda and I Œ I Œ I™ll acce
pt that, but naturally 
they are trying to 
tell the world about what 
America
 is doing, and to  give people news that would 
otherwise not have an  unbiased news re
port of any international event. So, the 
responsib ility weighs heavily on you, a
nd you try and do the 
best you can, and 
while you are doing it, you are being hamp er
ed by all kinds of nonsense. So that, 
as I say, is not altogether easy. After a 
period of time, I had Œ wh en was it? Yes, I 
worked f Œ I was then asked 
by the office of economic 
opportunity to  wo rk on th e 
war on poverty, President™s 
Johnso n™s
 war on poverty. And I 
became its first art 
director. Now, for Œ for Sargent 
Shriver,
 President 
Kennedy™s 
brother-in-law, and 
we have been friends ever since. And 
that was a-again, a very fascinating 
experience, because pa Œ the war on pover
ty was a Œ a thing that if you were 
involved  in it, you were enthused  to the 
point of Œ of personal dedication. I see 
images of that time where 20 or more peop
le Œ 20 of us woul
d get a mailing ready, 
and it didn™t matter what rank you were, th
ere were the top officials and Œ and the 
botto m officials in tennis shoes, running 
around tables, stuffing envelopes to get 
the thing out that had to be out the ne
xt day. And from my  point of view, I 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
70
designed the image of the whole thing, 
the Œ the Œ the logos, the emblems, the 
visual impact which was necessary because 
we had to  do everything we could to 
mu ster the enthusiasm of a Œ a Œ a nation 
th at was not always enth usiastic about 
the specific things we were trying to 
do. If you tried to open a job corps camp 
somewhere where you were 
training underp rivileged 
youngsters, these were 
teenagers and Œ and people were afraid of
 them. They were racial Œ there were 
racist preju d ices, where they said we don™
t want that next to our town , you know, 
and th-the Œ the kind of thing we had to
 try and overcome. I reme mb er incidents 
where in some job corps camp young men 
stole a car and drove it into a station 
wagon with a family and several members o f
 that family were killed. And the next 
day there was an outcry and the persec Œ ac
ross the country saying this program is 
no good. Well, it Œ nothing 
to do with the quality of 
the program and he would 
have stolen the car if he had not been 
in the job co rps presumably, and no reason 
to assume otherwise. Bu Œ and to  Œ to Œ to then  crucify the program because s-
somebody had deviated wh at was the kind
 of thing that we were at times up 
against. There were a Œ a story possibly ap
ic Œ apocryphal that went around, that 
the mayor of a town  who didn™t want to 
have a job corps camp  next to him said, 
these are going to be the Œ 
the Œ the Œ I Œ I have se Œ now the camp  had already 
opened an d he was trying to  get it closed down . And th e mayor said, th-the Œ it Œ 
it™s predominantly blacks in 
this program, and the offici
al from the war on poverty 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

71
office of economic opportunity  said, as a 
matter of fact, it™s 50 percent white. It Œ 
it™s no Œ as a matter of fact, it™s only 50
 percen t black. And th e mayor responded, 
well, you see, if it were 50 percent white, 
that would make it all rig h t. Which, as I 
say, possibly apocryphally illustrates y Œ the absurdity of the prejudice. The Œ then 
there was this Œ a s Œ a sudden solution 
for some of our problems because some  
brilliant mind, probably 
Sargent Shriver
 invented 
Head Start. Head Start
 being 
a preschool program when children are pe
rceived to be cute
 and Œ and little, and 
not a threat. And yet, in and of itself 
a most useful thing because the learning 
process should start pre school, as I think 
we have all come to realize. And th at 

was started with a tea at the White Hous
e. It was inaugurated and announced, and 
Œ and I designed its Œ its Œ 
its logo and so on of a 
couple of building blocks, 
symbolically. Lady
 Bird Johnson
 officiated at this opening, of wh ich I had like 
two days notice, and it™s still in existe
nce now. And I just had a letter from 
Sarge 
Shriver
 about it, because I wrote a short artic
le about how we Œ we Œ the obstacle 
course of getting that logo in to the White
 House tea in Œ with Œ with no advance 
notice. And it was not without problems, be
cause one of the things the legislatio n 

had said was, the maximum feasible partic
ipation of th e poor. And it was not easy 
to get Œ to recruit poor people wh o unde
rstood the state of  the art me t h odology of 
dealing with pre-school ch
ildren, because many of th
em had themselves been 
treated very casually, or neglected in thei
r own preschool period or Œ and later. 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

And to then put them into a responsible po
sitions to do it in such a way as not to 
damage the preschool children was Œ was 
not Œ well, it was quite a problem. Still, 
mu ch good was done over a difficult course. 
I worked for them fo
r Œ for 10 years. 
It started in a real f Œ peculiar way. I me
an, they had asked me to Œ to help, and I 
came as a volunteer, and then they wanted
 more help, and more help. And I said, 
listen, you guys, I can™t spend all my  time he
re, I have to make a living. And th ey 
said, do you want to do it as an outside 
person, or as a sta
ff person? Well, having 
had the experience with 
USA 
television, where as an 
outside person I found it 
terribly hard, I said staff. And they said, we
ll, what would it take
 to hire you? And 
I s Œ mind you, I had really believed wh
en I was first aske
d to do pro bono 
contributions that a-all the people work
ing for this program were volunteers and it 
turned out that all of them
 were staff and I was a volunteer. So I became a staff 
person. And I rememb er in the beginning 
of my  being a staff person, which meant 
somebody gave me a desk and a telepho
ne, you know, and ev
erything else was 
improvisation in  the beginning, there was a w riter who shared my office, as did 

indeed, five writers. But this particular one
 told me of his hardship that he was 
doing th is as volunteer work  and he hope
d to  get a job eventually, and that his 
children were hungry and nei
ghbors were looking after them and so forth. And I 
said, you have to Œ you know, they  are a
ll so busy with what 
they are doing, they 
are not thinking of you and me. And I had 
to go and say, look, fish or cut bait.

Either you Œ or I can™t come as much as 
you want me to come and work . And then 
they gave me a job. And he said, darn it,
 I™m gonna do it. A
nd he walked down to 
personnel and never came back
. He had told them to hire
 him mo re or not and they 
said not. So e-e Œ these were rough days
. I mean, you never knew wh at was going 
to Œ wh at was going to happen next. And 
Œ and we moved from place to place into 
improvised offices. And at the Œ at the times 
Shriver 
had two jobs, Peace Corps 
and poverty program and so 
on. But we did an enormous
 amount of good, I am 
quite convinced that some of the Œ the 
enthusiasm that was 
mu stered, of you Œ 
you™ve never seen government offices like 
th at where people are really Œ I mean, 
they would work  into
 the night and through the night 
for nothing, to get things out, 
get things done. It was a marvelous experi ence. Of course, there came the time 10 
years later when the admini
stration ch anged and the new one decided that there 
was no mo re poverty in the 
United Sta tes,
 along with  many other my th, you 
know, I mean the Œ the per
ception that poverty is pr
iv Œ predominantly Afro-
American is quite false. It is by no means 
that. It is, percentage-wise there are poor 
Œ poor whites in Œ in Œ in 
Appalachia
 and Œ and not only in 
Appalachia
. Because 
of the migration to the cities to fi
nd jobs for the Œ from Œ from the rural 
communities, and then the disillusionment when there aren™t enough jobs, and 

living in  city slums and so on, this is a s
yndrome that is true across the country. It 

is probably better now than it has been, wh
ich doesn™t mean its 
Œ it Œ it Œ it™s good.

But the awareness was, I think initiated Œ 
well, I don™t want Œ I Œ I wanted to  say 
by Œ by this program and Œ and it™s 
not quite true, because of course, 
Roosevelt
 
before has done Œ had do
ne tremendous work. But that had begun to perhaps 
dissipate a bit, until it was revived by Œ by 
Johnson
, who Œ who knew wh at it was 
like to be poor.  
Q: Can I ask you to give me a time frame ? When Œ wh at years Œ 

A: Yeah, well, let™s see, time frame. I 
worked for the Office of Economic 
Opportunity from October ™64 
to August ™74, 10 years r
oughly. And then wh en Œ 
when there was supposedly no more povert
y, we were dispersed and I was sent to 
the General Services Administration, wh
ich many perceived to be a fate worse 
than death. But by that time, having be
en in government for 10 years, I had 
inevitably become in
volved in some other battle
s, which is to make the 
government look better, which I think is te
rribly important. The government Œ you 
know, we Œ we tend to be cynical abou
t wh at the government does, and the 
government does some things extremely we
ll. Extremely well. And hides its Œ its 
light under a bushel, wh ere Œ wh ere you 
don™t Œ you don™t see what Œ how well 
they are doing certain things. I was al Œ I-I™
m not saying this is true of Œ of every 
aspect, but it™s true of many of their f
unctions. I remember when a Œ a thing was 
introduced in the general 
service administration, wher
e Œ to help citizens with 
questions about government, which if you™ve
 ever tried it by yourself, can be very, 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

75
very difficult. You call up and th ey say that
™s not in my  job description, or the Œ 
you Œ you Œ it™s not Œ doesn ™t
 belong here and it belongs
 over there and then  you Œ 
you have a sheet of paper in front of y
ou fu ll of telephone num
bers going down  as 
you™re being referred from one place to th
e other. Well, we in the General Service 
Administration at that time set out to Œ to
 Œ to end this kind 
of irritating obstacle 
course. And we had a Œ an Œ an office sp
ecializing in giving yo
u the right answer 
and steering you the right way. And I was 
skeptical that this
 would work. So I 
called them up. They couldn™t tell that 
I was calling from the same b u ilding, you 
know, and I asked Œ I Œ I got a young Af
ro -American woman on the phone, and I 
asked her a question wh ich I knew she c
ould not possibly know the answer, it was 
a comp lex question that required some re
search. And sh Œ she said, I™m sorry, I 
can™t answer this right away. I will call you 
in half an hour w
ith the answer. And I 
said, thank you very mu ch, and I so Œ sa
id to myself, yeah 
sure. In about 27 
minutes she called me  up with the right 
answ er. Now, I was absolutely bowled 
over, because it Œ believe me, it was a diffi
cult, tough question that she had to  
research and she did it with no complain
ts, no fuss. I was very impressed. Tha Œ 
tha Œ I hesitate to say that I believe 
the program no longer exists, and I wonder 
how easy it is now to get in
formation. But it was a move
 in the right direction. 
When I say I™m not sure it exists, I lear
ned another big lesson i-i-in Œ in Œ in  
government, and that is, I thought, when 
we had real progress, like by the poverty

program, visible progress, or with an invention such as this answering of citizen™s 
problems, you know, that there was no goi
ng back, that you could not Œ that no 

future administration would 
be foolish en ough to  go back to wh ere, you know, it 
would continue to move forward. That™s no
t true. They  are not 
only going back at 
Œ to the Œ to the Œ to  square
 one, they go to  50 years be
fo re square one, and there™s 
some common syndromes that
 I came to observe. For instance, a person fro Œ 
appointed politically, either party, doesn ™t 
make any difference, to some office and 
heads maybe a department, maybe a divisi
on. Even  smaller sub-units. You get the 
impression that the first thing they want 
to do is to write a 
letter home to mom to 
say I™m not at the feet of the president, 
I have his ear. And wh ether they want to 
invent a new identity for this particular 
department, division, whatever, regardless 
that it™s part of a bigger thing, the govern
ment, or if you want 
to go one step down, 
of Œ of Œ of one of the agencies of th
e government, it doesn™t matter, they want 
their own identity. So 
they Œ for Œ I™m Œ I™m speaking as
 a visual person. So all of 
a sudden you have all these things spring up
, and their taste generally runs to th e 

19
th
 century, and not the 20
th
 because they haven™t heard of wh at things look like 
in the 20
th
 century. But I™m Œ when
 I™m speaking visually, believe me that™s 
symbolic of everything else, they Œ they 
tend to hark back to 
something they  ha Œ 
heard of how things are, where, and they
 want to imitate, and since they are not 
necessarily chosen fo r being innovators, th
ey tend to retard the pro Œ the progress 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

77
and go back  to, befo re it was when it was 
already outmoded. Well, that™s how it is. 
So one has to be constantly
 alert, to keep th ings going forward. An d people get 
really doing that at times. So Œ a
nd I™m not even men
tioning politics, I™m 
mentioning simp ly the bureaucratic proce
ss, which is unavoidable to Œ s-so it 
would seem, because innovators who are 
capable of not that common a specimen. 
Well, after many a fight, some of which I™v
e won, I di Œ for instance, I designed 
the building signs in the federal triangle 
that you still see where the newscasters 

stand in front of the thing th at 
says Department of Justice, or 
U.S.
 Department of 
Agriculture, whatever. They are these ver
tical standing brownish colo red things 
with very clear lettering, with a little bul
ge forward so you can read the title. And 

they are made of reinforced fiberglass. A
nd I had to get those accepted by the fine 
arts commission. They were supposedly su
pposed  to be a pilot program for all of 
Washin gton
 and then the whole country. 
The federal triangle being th e 
experimental area. When I Œ when I presen
ted it to the fine arts commission, they 
said, how long are these signs good fo r? An
d I said Œ I was about to say, oh, state 
of the art, they last long time, when 
Carter Brown
, who was the chairman of the 
fine arts commission anticipated that and said
, what we are afraid of is that they 
will last too long, because after 10 years our
 tastes will have changed and we™ll get 
tired of looking at them, and they won™t 
give us any money to do new ones if 
they™re still good. So
 I said, they will last ex ac
tly 10 years. And two things

happened. One, they ar
e still there after, I th
ink, what is it? 25 years. And they are 
getting shabby, and still they are not re
placing them. And secondly, it never 
happened that they 
were Œ that they were done all 
over th-the Œ the town , or all 
over the country. A few were done by the 
initiative of some agencies here and 
there, but never beyond that. I-It j u st Œ 
not because they di
dn™t like them, not 
because they weren™t good, 
they just didn™t get around to it, to it Œ it doesn™t 
follow if something is efficient and works th
at this plan Œ that this plan will be 
permitted.

This is tape three, side
 B,
 and you were telli
ng me about your 
professional career and I believe
 you left me around 1974.  
A: Yes. The Œ when  Œ ™74 Œ 
I™d gone slightly beyond 
that Œ was when the Office 
of Economic Opportu nity ceased to exis
t and I was transferred to the General 
Service Administration and I had said that
 I had, by now, become a fighter for 
making the government look better to th
e s Œ to the citizen. And to  try and 
introduce some, at leas
t semblance of the 20
th
 century while it lasted, to the 
general population. Whereas everything te
nded to be done backwards, visually, I 
mean, a government department. When I did 
the signs in the federal triangle, I had 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
79
to find a sign th at would be compatible with the earlier tendency to  make a 
government office look like a Greek temp le, 
because why? A Greek temp le is Œ is 
old and solid, and the government, like bank
s, built like Greek temples, as we used 
to do, were deemed to be more solid if they looked lik
e a Greek temple. Well then 
came the Œ the craving for m
odernity, and we got the kind
 of new deal architecture 
of an empty Œ beginnings 
of the influences of 
Ba uha us
 in Œ in Œ in style. And th at 
in turn led to  a degree of 
Ba uhaus
 fatigue. That you didn™t want plain boxes that 
were functional. The idea of Œ of the 
Bauhaus
 being that if it
™s functional and Œ 
and Œ and simp le, and i-i Œ and efficient,
 it is beautiful, and it does not require 
decoration. And I was brought up with th
at in art school, that simp le, if it™s 
functional, it™s beautiful, okay? No w lo ok 
what™s happened since. We Œ because of 

the Œ what I call the 
Bauhaus
 fatigue, we started with arbitrary and often ugly 
decora Œ over decoration. We
 had put flying buttresses ont
o build ings as a sort of 
harking back to wh en  we were building 
thi Œ Greek temples. 
And in post-modern 
you see arbitrary archways that lead no
where, attached to buildings as Œ as 
decoration. And Œ a-and th-the answ er, if
 any Œ no Œ I Œ I Œ I™m not suggesting 
there is an answer, the answ
er is that no matter what we have, the only constant 
thing is Œ is change. We are going to 
go to something else, because you want 

something else, and it doesn ™t me an th
at it is necessarily better than its 

predecessor. That would be nice, and Œ 
but again, like I was saying about Œ a-

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
80
about progress in government, I Œ you mu stn™t accept the notion that because the 
ultimate has been achieved, that
 it will therefore stay in Œ 
in Œ even in its Œ in its 
degree of quality. This is true in the ar
ts. It Œ  one could make one heck of an 
argument of saying that beyond 
Beethoven
, you know, maybe we should have 
stopped there. Well, that™s not fair, becaus
e look at some of the great things that 
have come to us since then. Wh ether they
 are better than the 
classic, the role 
models, is Œ is arguable. 
Another thing is that Œ that today™s art modern is 
tomorrow™s classic. We had be
en talking befo
re about the 
Beatles
, 
Elvis Presley,
 
and some of us were shocked when they 
came on the scene. And some of us now 
look upon these manifestations as classical
, compared to hard 
rock, compared to 
where we are now. We are nostalgic for the 
Beatles
 and for
 Elvis Presley
. You 
see? And it™s amazing how you can apply this
 formula to all kinds of completely 
different things, as I have just done, and I 
can go beyond that, it 
is in Œ in the ci Œ 
Civil Rights Movement, which I embraced w
ith great enthusiasm, having just been 
through six years of war to f Œ to fi
ght against racism. And I would have 
arguments with people on all sides. I™d 
have arguments with some of my  Afro-
American friends who would 
say ha Œ I had an Afro-A merican partner with whom 
I had va Œ hardly any arguments, we were
 on the same wavelengths. But with 
some of them who said that the persecution of Afro
-
Americans
 
was as bad as the 
Holo caust, and I would say th ho Œ ho
 Œ hold it, hold it right there. 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

[indecipherable]
 I will agree with one thing, that if Œ if you are running away  
from a lynch mob, it probably doesn™t 
make any difference whether you™re 
running from the Holocaust or from the 
lynch mob. But, apart from that, the 
notion th at there is a federal program 
for your extermination and murder is 
different than even th e collusion and perm
issiveness of a government that allows 
lynch mobs. That Œ this is not an advocac
y of lynch mobs, obviously, but Œ but the 

point is, the idea that it was legislated
 to mu rder everybody. Men, wo men, 
children, old people, wh atever, is unique. 
And therefore, the comparison does not 
hold, okay? I remember that when I wa
s in t Œ in television, and my Afro-
American assistant, who later became my 
partner when  we both quit, wa Œ there 
was one sort of greasy spoon restaurant 
owned by a Greek man on the corner. The 
only place you could eat outsi
de, before we had a cafeteria. Well, so metimes 
somebody would say, let™
s talk about next week
™s show over lunch at 
Frank™s
, 
that restaurant. And that meant th at I woul
d have to go, and my
 assistant could not 
go because of being Afro-American, they
 didn™t serve blac
k people in the 
restaurant. Which was embarrassing for me. I 
could either say let™s n o t eat, which 
I wasn't always e-empowered to say, de
pending on who wanted to  eat where and 
when. Mind you, they 
would sell my  partner 
Joe
 sandwiches to take out. There 
was a s Œ back counter, and he would sometim
es have to do that, because he Œ he Œ 
he Œ well, I don™t know, he didn™t have tim
e to have a sandwich prepared at home 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

82
Œ have to eat. And we work ed around the 
clock often, you know, so I mean Œ came 
the Civil Rights Act in
 the 60s and I said,
 Joe
, are you gonna eat at 
Frank™s?
 And 
he said, I been thinking about that. And 
I said, well, I can see both sides of the 
argument. Why should you take your custom
 to a place that wouldn™t serve you? 
In fact, the waitress, w h en the Civil Right
s Act was passed, told me at the meeting 
that they Œ I think I™m going 
to quit because we are going to have to serve niggers. 
And I made some remark saying, well I th
ink it™s time that that act was passed, 
you know. Well, 
Joe
 said, on th e other hand, if I don™t go in to eat at 
Joe™s
, what 
was the point of getting the Civil Rights Ac
t? So he said, I think I will. On the 
other hand, he said, I will fully understand
 if some of my race do not go in to eat 
in restaurants that were segregated until 
yesterday, because Œ and here comes the 
important sentence Œ not everybody can be 
a pioneer. And I think th at™s true. I 
think that there are people who are willing to
 fight and to be confrontational, and 
tell people, who say I Œ I Œ I don™t think 
I™m up to that. And y
ou can try and Œ and 
Œ and Œ an d influence people, but basically
 it is also true that some people are 

pioneers and some people are not. You need  
the pioneers and you mu st accept that 
there are some people who are not. So, when 
we got into subsequent discussions, I 
remember some people I considered raci
st in the poverty program, saying, you 
know, we™d come out of the building from
 work and there would be some news 

headlines out in the street
, and they would say that 
Stokey Carmichael
, or 
Rap 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

83
Brown
, aren™t they awful troublemak
ers, what have you. Now, 
Martin Luther 
King, 
that™s a different proposition. And I sa
id, aren™t you forgetting that that™s 
how you looked at 
Martin
, until the more extreme 
Stokey Carmichaels 
and 
Ra p 
Brown
 came on the scene, by which the Œ ye
sterdays revolutionary beco mes the 
classi cist,  j u st like we were saying in th
e arts, or in other things, you see? They Œ 
the extreme of today makes the extreme of yesterday the conservative. In fact, 

sometimes pathetically so. 
And Œ and that™s Œ that™s 
how Œ ho-how that played , 
and it was an ongoing Œ an ongoing discu
ssion, and I feel that it has progressed. 
But one thing we learned in 
the poverty program is that 
we were trying to redress 
past wrongs. If you ask the 
redressee
, have we redressed wrongs enough, th e 
answer is inevitably that we have bare
ly scratched the surface. That leads to 
someone wanting to put on the brakes, if only for politi
cal reasons, because if you 
are doing something that is unpopular w
ith th e general public because they say 

you are redressing too mu ch, and unpopular with the 
redressees
, b ecause they say 
you are not redressing enough, you are 
losing on both sides. You are losing 
politically and you are losing the things y
ou are setting out to do. So, you have a 
very, very , very serious problem, and you in
ev itably begin to repress a bit together 
with redressing. In other 
words, wh en you put the br
akes on redressing wrongs, 
you are repressing th-the people. By that 
I mean you are denying them some of the 
redressing they would like to
 have, because they Œ you Œ 
you can™t do as much as 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
84
they want you to do. So, th
is Œ the rather delicate balance between redressing and 
repressing Œ and by repressing I don™t mean
 any Œ any acts of
 Œ of Œ of Œ of 
keeping somebody down, I™m me rely calling 
it the insufficient redressing which is 
perceived as repression, all right? So wh
en you do this Œ this Œ this delicate 
balance. You co me to the point wh ere it™s 
almost impossible to walk the tightrope 
and your political opponents 
will scream bloody murder that you are redressing 
too mu ch . And then  you have
 protesters outside your 
building saying you are not 
redressing enough. Now, 
Shriver
 had a great talent for 
this, he would go down on 

the sidewalk to the protesters
, invite them to his office 
and sit down with them and 
reason with them. His successors barricaded
 themselves in th
e building, stopped 
the elevator service, which again illustra
tes the misconception 
that things that 
move forward contin ue to move forward, 
th ey don™t. Well, I found that i-in Œ in 
some ways progression continues to progre
ss, perhaps. An exam
ple that comes to 
mind is anti-Semitism which pr
obably belongs here. When
 I first came to this 
country and Œ in Œ in Œ 
in the Œ the end of the 
40s, the beaches around 
Washin gton
 had signs saying Gen
tiles only. Not whites onl
y, Gentiles only. And 
it was in Œ understood without saying that
 that meant white Gentiles, okay? And 
there was Father
 Coughlin
 and there was 
Bilbo
 up on the hill spouting an ti-
Semitism and the likes of which we have 
mercifully forgotten, how blatant and Œ 
and Œ and crude that anti-si
n Œ Semitism wa Œ seemed ac
ceptable on the floor of 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

85
the house. Now, shall we say that has be
come unfashionable, or deemed primitive, 
whatever, I don™t know. And I find it difficu
lt to picture that it would return in 
totality. Perhaps there™s some 
elements of the extreme so-c alled religious right that 
would like to revive those days. I™m sure
 they wouldn™t admit it at this point, 
because as I say, it™s u n fashionable, and 
recognized to be primitive, which I think 

is a good thing. Bu t we shouldn™t delude 
ourselves that there aren™t places where 
the attitude exists. I fin d  it exists in Œ in
 Europe
 to a Œ to a considerable extent, 
more overtly than
 in Œ in the 
United States 
now. I was told yesterday by a man 
who told me that his father was a 
Nazi, that there is m Œ that in 
Germany
, even 
though there is this movement of Œ of 
Œ of the young who Œ 
who Œ who abhor their 
Nazi past, or the Nazi past of their parents, and th is man abhors the Nazi past of 

his father, but he says his father was une
mp loyed, and he was 
an engineer and he 
was repairing radios to make
 a living of sorts. And wh en
 Hitler
 came to power he 
got a job as an engineer. So he thought that
 Œ he Œ he said, wh at they are doing to 
the Jews is Œ that™s bad, bad. Bu
t look what it has done for me. And 
von 
Stauffenberg, 
who tried to assassinate 
Hitler
 is considered a traitor by one and 
all, by the vast majority of people. I 
found that shocking, I didn™t know th at, I 
thought Œ and I still believe there are segm
ents of the people who consider him a 
resistance p erson. This Œ this man told me
 that there isn™t a single memorial or 
monument to 
Stauffenberg
, because vast ma jority of people consider him a

86
traitor. Now, I Œ I™ve Œ I Œ I find that Œ I 
me an, that came as a shock. I did not 
know that. I thought that 
the disillusionment with 
Hitler
 and Œ and by saying 
disillusionment I™m implyi
ng that there was an 
illusionment
 before, and Œ and 
there certainly was. And so me of it, 
if you will understand the burd en, like the 
man who didn™t have a job that
 got a job, like the peculiar historic situation wh ere 
you have a German 
Reich
 that was 90 years old. Befo re that there were 
duchies 
and principalities of Œ of 
Munich, Saxony
, whatever. 
Prussia.
 And that after 
losing World War I, there was Œ first of all,
 it was kept intact, as opposed to the 
Austro-Hungarian empire, which was 
2,000 years old and was comp letely 
chopped up because of
 the ethnic elements, all of wh
om had been caught in this 
thing we just mentioned about th-th-
the tightrope between repression and 
redressing, because if an Austrian empero r or Austrian government tried to redress 
the demands of the Hungarians, or the 
Serbs, or the Czechs, it was politically 
unpopular at home and deemed insufficient 
by th e recipients of the programs, who 
wanted out, never mind how and ju st soon
er better than later. As in deed we are 
now seeing in 
Bosnia
 and in all these places wher
e small minorities, whether they 
are viable or not, completely not caring 
about whether they can form a viable 
entity, want to be nationalis
tically independent. Even 
the most reaso n able among 
them, and I have talked to some of the mo
st reasonable, will say that first we must 
have our independence and then  we can a
ttempt to confederate. In the meantime, 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

87
the process of getting that independence 
is bloody and Œ a
nd destructive. And 
unreasonable. And Œ and th ere™
s nothing we seem to be able to do about it because 
we don™t necessarily progress. Now, in 
Germ any
, this Œ this relatively recent 
empire of Œ of Œ of 90 year
 old confederation, they y
earned to be powerful again. 
Understandably, the Austro-Hungarian
s never had any dream of becoming a 
powerful empire again, because that woul
d mean gluing together the thing where 
the glue hadn™t held, o-of Œ of Œ of et
hnic minorities, you see? So they never had 
that ambition, except 
perhap s in the case of some Austrians who were pan Œ pan-
German thinkers, and thought as part of 
the German emp ire, they could see some 
greatness again. But I wouldn™t say there were many until 
Hitler
 demonstrated 
that that dream of be Œ of Œ of Œ of re
gaining power for this
 German entity could 
be realized, in that he was immensely su
ccessful politically a
nd Œ and Œ and Œ and 
militarily. And took over one 
country after the other, right?
 And if your victorious 
armies are marching into country after c
ountry with a minimum of casualties, and 
asserting themselves as Œ as the masters 
of the world, it™s probably hard for th e 
average citizen not to stand and cheer 
at Œ at the sidelines, when all that 
technological hardware is rolling past you 
an d Œ and the pageantry, at which th ey 
were very good. They were 
very, very skilled in visual 
pageantry. Well, the Œ I see 
a bridge here to something else
 we wanted to cover, which is 
Vietnam
. The bridge 
is this; when the 
Vietnam 
situation started, I, after my
 six years of war and being

an officer in the British army
, in an elite unit, thought 
that that was the reasonable 
thing to do. I thought that
 the domino theo ry, which had been demonstrated by
 
Hitler
, that is you don™t stop him when  he first occupies the 
Rhin eland
, then he 
will occupy 
Austria
, 
Czechoslovakia
 and then  continue the rest of western
 
Euro pe
, all right? If you Œ wh at you sh ould 
have done, clearly, was to stop him 
when  he occupied th e 
Rhineland
. Well, the parallels seemed obvious. The big 
threat now was communi
sm. If they took over 
Vietnam
 and one didn™t stop them 
there, they would take over the rest of southeast 
Asia
. And not necessarily as a 
popular movement, but as a enslaving kind
 of mechanism. Well, true or false, 
right? Wh at subsequently changed my  mind,
 not very long after, was the painful 
realization that just before Œ because 
you are right Œ and ev en that, of course, 
becomes Œ is arguable, but even  if you pe
rceive yourself to be right, you can™t 
undertake things that are Œ that you™re 
going to lose. It™s impractical. So for 
pragmatic reasons if nothing else, th e idea of subduing communism in 
Vietnam
, 
which turned out to be a popular nationa
listic movement, if you are going to  Œ to 
fight a losing war, the answer obviously is 
don™t Œ don™t go in the first place. That 
means admitting that you can™t do it. A
nd Œ and that takes a lot Œ it™s Œ it™s 
sometimes harder to do for a 
head  of state to say, we think we ought to be doing 
this, but we can™t. It™s hard
er to do than to
 say okay, go. A-And th en afterwards, 
when you have enormous numbers of peop
le killed and Œ and maimed, there is, of

course, no Œ no easy way back
. You Œ you can™t bring them
 back. But, in a sense, 
those who were afraid of a domino theory
 had their Œ their fears borne out to a 
considerable extent. After awhile when 
Œ when Œ wh en  communism itself became 
the image of a failed meth
odology, the whole thing seems redundant. I mean, what 
communism were we afraid of? Russian
 communism, Chin ese communism. Well, 
Russian communism as Œ is Œ i-is Œ is gone. Chin ese communism is 

metamorphosing in all Œ into
 all kinds of other things. 
Whether we are justifiably 
afraid of that now, is really,
 A
, it Œ it Œ it doesn™t apply in
 the same sense as it  
applied at that time. And th ere were proba
bly a couple of other factors in there. I 
think that we are still in 
this country resentful of th e former colonial powers, 
because after all, we w ere under British ru
le, and so, if the British were pushed out 
of the Persian gulf, that didn™t really hu rt us. I-If the French were pushed out of 
Vietnam, Indochina
, that Œ we were gonna do it better. We were gonna show 
them that i-it spilt Œ the failure was becaus
e they were colonial powers. Well, our 
trying to get into these things with 
limited experience and assume a p seudo-

colonial role in c Œ in 
Œ in countries i-in the
 
Persian gulf, or in Œ in Œ in Œ in 
southeast 
Asia
, hasn™t work ed out too well. And 
Œ because the world is readjusting 
itself and Œ and the Œ yesterda
y™s methods progressed as na
 Œ as Œ it begins to be 
questionable whether progress is progress as
 we perceive it. And also, it doesn™t 
necessarily go fo rward. It goes Œ I-I would 
think th at if you asked people the Œ the 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
90
academic question whether they
 would prefer the Persian 
gulf to be as it was, 
which means playing footsy  with th e shah
, who was not necessarily a demo cratic 
leader, we™d probably 
happily settle for that at Œ at 
this moment, instead of what 
we™ve got. What can you do
? I-It Œ the Œ and Œ and Œ 
and as for the Œ the non-
viable mini-states that spring up 
as nationalist units, the example of 
Slovakia
 
having sp lit off from 
Czech Republic,
 because they felt that 
they were treated like 
underdogs, with justification. But, by th
emselves much less viable, and I™m sure 
that a great many of them are sorry that 
they split off. There is no visible easy way 
back to that confederation, 
that comes after th e national thing, as I have been told, 
you know. No easy way back . 
So we are Œ we are perp
etually shooting ourselves 
in the foot all over, I mean, not you and 
I, but people everywhere, in their own 
situations.

And 
you had told  me about your professional 
career, and you told me about the social

tell me about your

A: Well, I came, if you recall, from Œ from
 England
 on a 
Fulbright
 and sterling Œ 
pounds sterling were not convertible, so 
I had no money. And the art schools were 
not board ing schools, so I liv
ed at International House
 
in 
New York
 at 500 
Riverside
 Drive. An d that was very stimulating because there were students from 
all over, and many friends, wh ich I maintain to
 this day. Some of them I haven™t Œ 
I hadn™t seen in, I guess almost 50 years, but
 my friendships are of the nature that I 
can pick them up any time as if th ere had 
been  no time gap. We had recently been 
to 
Hawa ii
, where I had friends from International Student House whom I hadn™t 
seen since. And it worked lik
e we had never parted. I Œ one
 day, a Greek student in 
New York
 who lived at the house, said let™s hitchhike to 
Washin gton. 
I™m going 
to hitchhike to
 Washington,
 anybody want to come along? I said sure. I Œ I™ve 
never been  there, and I know so mebody in 
Wa sh ing t on .
 Let me try and telephone 
and see whether I can arrange something. 
So  I did what in those days was an 
unusual activity, a long distance te
lephone call. And I went and called
 
Washin gton, 
and I had no address of the pers
on I was looking fo r, who had been 
the fiancée of a friend of mine wh
o was a commando colleague in Œ in 
England
 
and in 
No rmandy
, we b-both went in 
on the same team to 
Norm andy
, and we 
were very, very close friends. And we double dated in 
Eng l and
. I was engaged to 
an Irish girl from northern 
Ireland
. Have we covered that before? Well, the Œ his 
fiancée was Œ had come out on the ch
 Œ ki Œ children™s transport from

Czechoslovakia
 and had work  in 
Lo ndon
 for the Czech gover
nment in exile until 
the coup in 
Czechoslovakia
 when  she lost her job. Sh e had been alone to th e 
second in ternational conference, annual co
nference of the International Monetary 
Fund, and th ey had offered her a job in
 Wa shington. 
And wh en she lost her job in 
London
, sh e accepted the job in 
Washin gton
, because why not, for a year, and 
had Œ in other word s, come for a year 
at the International 
Monetary Fund in 
Washin gton. 
I couldn™t reme mb er the name of the International Monetary Fu nd
 
and I first asked th-the
 Washin gton
 telephone operator wh ether I Œ she had a 
listing by name, and she didn™t. So  I said we
ll, there™s an organization th at belongs 
to the United Nations. And she sa
id, the United Nations are in 
Flushing 
Meadows, New York
. And I said, I know that, but there is some branch, it™s 
called the United Nations Fund, or the Un
ited Nations bank, or something. And 
she said, sir, United Nations are in 
Flushing Meadows, Long Island, New York.
 
After we™d been over that a co
uple of times, I said, I tell
 you what, forget it, and I 
hung up. Obviously  I wasn't going to ge
t anywhere and I went to see the Greek 
student who had wanted to hitchhike to 
Wash ington,
 and I said, I™m having 
problems about this 
Wa sh ing t on
 thing, I can™t reach my party. And he said, I™ve 
decided not to go. I said okay, it™s 
off. So it didn™t happen. Awhile later,
 Alice
 
went to
 Londo n
 on home leave, 
London
 being her home, and me t with our 
mu tual friend and Œ and other friends 
from the commandos. And they  said, oh,

93
when you go back through
 New Yo rk
, you mu st bring this book that is just out to 
Peter. 
The book was ﬁ
The Green Beret
,ﬂ the first book about the commandos by 
Hilary Saint
 
George Saunders,
 a historian. And she had said, oh
, Peter 
is in 
New York
? I didn™t know that. And sh e brought me the book. No w, I Œ I have to 
go back a mo ment and say that
 when she left for Œ for
 Washin gton
 from
 London
, 
her fiancé said to me, I have Œ he was in
 business already and I was in art school Œ 
he said, I have a shipment coming in in th
e docks, and I can™t take off, I have to be 
there. But you are an art student, you ca
n take time off. Why don
™t you go with her 
to Œ whatever it was, 
Cooks
, and help her make the arrangements? Anyone who 
knows 
Alice
 knows that she needed my  help lik
e the hole in the head. She Œ when 
she worked for the International Monetary
 Fund, she made travel arrangements for 
60 people, and my  helping he
r was a laugh. Bu t I took time off and went down the 
road to 
Cooks 
on 
Southampto n 
Row,
 King™s 
Way, which was five minutes from 
my  school, and gave her, as 
Œ as a matter of fact, a going away present of one of 
my little 
Ashanti 
gold weights that I had acqui
red during my  six mo nths in 
Africa
 
at the end of the war. And she brought me 
the book and I told her the story about 
how I had almo st come  to 
Washington
 and she said, well, you mu st come and see
 
Washin gton. 
And I said sure. And of course
, having no money, I hitchhiked.
 
Holland
 tunnel or whatever, and in those days
, if you got a ride straight thro ugh it 
took seven and a half hours,
 and you never got a ride 
straight through, so it took 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

94
10 - 11 - 12 hours. And I would start at Œ 
after school, about fo
ur o™clock, and Œ 
and hitchhike. There was, of course, no 
New Jersey
 turnpike. There was no bridge 
over the 
Delaware.
 There was a ferry. There was no tunnel under 
Baltimore
 and 
no route 95, but route one with traffic li
ghts and what have you. I usually hit 
Baltimore
 in the early hours of the morning,
 like two o™clock a-and Œ and usually 
on a truck which dropped me off somewher
e in the harbor district. And on one 
occasion, two poten tial muggers followed me 
and in fact I Œ I had a suitcase and a 
portfolio to carry, so they co
uld walk faster than I could, and they  Œ I Œ I decided I 
w Œ I would Œ I would walk in the middle of the road so  I wouldn™t be pulled in 
anywhere, and I stopped and they came and 
said, at two in the mo rning, and asked 
me for a lig ht. And I said, I don™t smoke. 
Is there anything else you want? And I 
had a metal suitcase w h ich I held, which I wa
s going to throw at them and run, if 
necessary. And they decided that this wa
s not a good propositi
on and th ey decided 
not to Œ to mug me. And Œ but it was an
 unpleasant incident and looked very  
threatening. And a Œ another story that comes to mind is it Œ one time it poured, 

and it was just before
 Alice™s
 birthday and I was Œ I ha
d bought her ano Œ a new 
umbrella, and it was gift wrapped. And I 
carried that umbrella gift wrapped and 
wouldn™t open it because I didn™t want to spoil the thing, I carried it under my 

jacket so it wouldn™t get wet.
 Anyway, after hitchhiking to 
Washington 
a few 
times, w-we met in 
New York 
and in 
Wa shington.
 And in the following spring,

1950, we were married. And 
Alice
 had arranged some interviews for me in 
Washin gton 
to find a job, and th e person who 
was going to help me find the job 
ran a small public relations agen cy , and he
 desired Œ he si Œ he decided that he 
would hire me himself and call it public re
lations and advertising and I was the art 
director of this small outfit, and it wa
s not an altogether positive experience. I 
think I earned 30 dollars a week and that 
was low even  by the 
standards of that 
time. But I had quite some exposu re. I did three full color ads for 
ﬁEsquireﬂ
 
magazine and I found th at I had to solic
it some of the jobs because nobody else 
seemed to be doing it and after awh
ile everybody quit and I was the only 
employee. But one of them ha
d preceded me into television and he offered me a Œ 
a job in television. We™v e Œ may have covered that before. Anyway, in the 
meantime, 
A-Alice 
and I had moved into  a one room apartment on Œ on 
Belmont
 
Street in
 Washington,
 which was rather Œ rather prim
itive, but not Œ not at all bad, 
and after a period we moved down town in
to an air conditione
d apartment. That 
was the height of luxury . Small one, also
. And we had our first child, a daughter, 
Anne
, who from a very early ag
e wanted to  do professi
onally exactly what I was 
doing and Œ and helped me, even as a child
. And got very proficient and became a 
good grap hic designer and is one to this
 day. Then  we had a second daughter
, 
Kim
, who also Œ all of them leaned in di
rections that I had marginally been 
involved in. She started to 
write poetry, wh ich we have done traditionally in  my

family for every birthday. An
d of course, she went beyond that and she became a 
writer and is at this stag
e a contributing editor to 
ﬁVanity Fairﬂ 
and ﬁ
Timeﬂ 
magazine, and is writing her s
econd book, called tentatively, 
ﬁKeys to the 
Kingdom,ﬂ
 meaning 
Michael Eisner 
and the 
Disney 
operation. That™s big league 
writing, not the sort of thing that Œ that 
I™m doing. Well, as Œ this morning, as a 
matter of fact, in looking fo r a certain 
book, I came across the album of Œ of 
birthday cards over the years, and it™s qu
ite a collection because they are both 
graphics and Œ and Œ and at
 least doggerel verse, a
nd it™s a heartwarming memento 
that I Œ I Œ I think i-I Œ astonished me
 because I had forg otten some of them, 
they™ve been so long ago. 
But the tradition goes on. The 
tradition also goes on to 
my third child which Œ 
Tim,
 a Œ a Œ a son who wo rks for the Discovery Channel as 
senior manager of special events, and lives
 only five minutes from my house. And 
he writes absolu tely beautiful birthday 
poets Œ poems. Ever
ybody knows what 
birthday poems sound like and I sometimes 
wince at the bad meter and Œ and the 
suggested ego trip of all of us
 who do th is. But my  daughter 
Kim
 and my son
 
Tim,
 write absolutely gorgeous 
ones, far better than anything I™ve ever done. And 
incidentally, my  children being named 
Anne, Kim 
and 
Tim
, the last one was 
Kim™s
 idea, together with the support of he
r older sister. And we said, if we call 
him 
Tim
 and we calling you Œ hi
m Œ or we call you, you 
will never know which 
one we are calling because it sounds alike. 
And sh e said, that™s the idea. A-As you 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

can see where she comes from.
 Well, they™re all married. 
Anne
 is married to an 
architect and lives in 
Washin gton
 and has three children; 
David
, who is now 11, 
Sam
, who is nine and 
Hannah
 who is almo st six. And 
Kim
 had great trouble Œ 
she is married to 
Gary Simpso n,
 who is in television, movies in 
Hollywood. 
Sh e 
Œ
 Kim 
moved to 
Hollywood 
because she covers
 Hollywood
. She used to work for 
the 
ﬁWashingto n Postﬂ
 for many years for style, but
 now she doesn™t work for a 
papers, she writes the book and contributes 
articles to those two publications. She 
had great difficulty having a baby. She had 
10 in-vitros attemp ting to have a baby, 
all failed. And ultimately 
succeeded by having a Œ a surr
ogate carry her child. The 
baby is hers and her husband™s, implante
d into a surrogate, who carried it and it™s 
now a few months old, a little 
girl. And the Œ one thing th
at comes to mind is when 
she and th e surrogate were together in th
e hospital for the birth of the baby, the 
baby cried during th e night, and 
Kim
 said, the baby is crying. And the surrogate 
mo ther said, it™s not my baby, you go and ta
ke care of it. And she has been doing 
that happily ever since. Took some adju
stment, because when you don™t carry the 
baby, the impact on your life, whe Œ whic
h suddenly changes without the relief of 
not carrying it any more is Œ is quite an e
xperience, that I hadn™t really anticipated. 
But she adjusted to it 
very well, and now all is going ve
ry well. And as we sit here 
and speak, 
Tim
 and his wife 
Laurie, 
who also works for Discovery cable 
television, she is vice-president in charge 
of marketing, expect their first baby. The

phone could ring now. I know we™ve turn
ed them off, but even so, and sh e might 
be having that baby. We don™t know wh
ether it™s a boy or a girl, any Œ any day 
now. The Œ all three ch ildren, by the way, we
nt to school in Œ in this area, in the 
Washin gton
 area, and all three of them didn't 
like high school, and wanted to  get 
out as soon as possible. So, it was possibl
e in the district to take, I don™t know, 
English four and I forget what else, math
, over the summ er and graduate early. All 
three of them did that. You didn™t have to 
be brilliant to graduate early, just had to 
take a couple of summer courses. And 
they  wanted to avoid the graduation 
ceremony, none of th em wanted to go th
ro ugh it, peculiarly perhap s, and all of 
them wanted out. And all of
 them Œ each one of them 
did something different with 
the year they gained by
 graduating a year early. 
Anne
 worked for a design studio 
before she went to art scho
ol. She had helped me all along. And after a period of 
good experience, went to 
Pratt
 in Œ in 
New York
, and was in many ways ahead, 
because she had the practical experien
ce. And this was in a period when 
practicality was not big in the art school
s. You know, they would say, design a 
logo for Œ design a logo for a Œ an Œ and 
use Œ draw it on a brick. If that sounds 
absurd, that was Œ I™m Œ I™m doing this on pu
rpose, or a cinder block, because that 
was characteristic of the time. Practicality 
was not the main thin
g. You did things 
that were impractical, but original, okay? 
It was the post-modern
 I talked to you 
about before. Well, so that was how 
she spent her year that she gained.
 Kim 
did 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

99
something entirely different. She went
 to visit my wife™s sister in 
London
. And in 
London
 the county council runs all kinds of
 courses, which are affordable and 
very, very good. So she lear
ned Œ she took courses in a
ll the things she might want 
to be interested in later, 
having no idea where she was 
going to  go. Sh e took one in 
psychology, one in ceramics, one in Italian,
 one in drama, and I forget what else. 
And after she was through, she decided 
none of the above, and she became an 
English major, and now it became very im
portant at what school she was to 
continue. And one of my  co
lleagues on Œ a very senior 
older person in the poetry 
program, had been a president of 
Bryn Mawr
, and she Œ and wh en  I talked about 
the program said, oh
 Kim
 abso lutely must go to 
Bryn Mawr
 and she took her 
there. And there was a sort of a Œ it really fitted 
Kim
 like Œ like a glove. There is a 
traditional Poet Laureate in 
Bryn Mawr
 who is anonymous un
 Œ and writes under 
the name of 
Appleb ee
, which was the name of the gym teacher who introduced 
hockey to  schools in the 
United States. 
And 
Applebee
 is selected by the outgoing 
Applebee
 after submissions of samp le poems
. And nobody knows who it is, and 
they write snide poems about Œ well, critical o f Œ of
 Œ of the school management 
or wh atever, or social gossip bu Œ and wi
th  Œ with double entendres galore. And 
Kim
 became
 Applebee 
in her junior year, I think. A
nd the Œ the Œ I Œ I even recall 
the interview because 
Kim
 had read mo re books than
 anybody I know, and sh Œ 
before she went to co llege. And wh en yo
u go for an interview 
they want to see

your reading list. And she went to 
Cornell
 and they looked at her reading list, 
which was a Œ a foldout, a-a Œ it was so
 long, and said, about wh at we would 
expect and that offended 
Kim 
deeply because she knew it wasn™t true. It was a 
putdown , you see. And at 
Bryn Mawr
, when she showed he
r reading list, the 
interviewer put it aside after glancing at it a
nd said yes, but what is your favorite Œ 
who is your favorite author? And 
Kim 
said, without hesitation, 
Jane Austen
. And 
the interviewer said, she is mine too, let™s talk about 
Jane Austen.
 They talked for 
three hours about 
Jane Austen
. So there™s no question she was going to go 
anywhere else. 
Tim
 used his extra year to take an 
internship in television, because 
he had been  interested in Œ in radio and 
television from being a Œ a toddler. In fact, 
in his house hangs a picture of him with
 his first phonograph wh en he was about 
four years old, and he is carefully pu
tting down the needle, and subsequently 
worked as a disc jockey for 
the university of dis Œ dis Œ 
District of Columbia
 
station. He had a program called 
Jazzm asters 
with
 Tim Masters. 
And when 
C-
Span 
bought the station and there was no more 
jazz, the hearts of all  the listener s 
bled, because they were so 
attached to that classical 
jazz program. And he misses 
it. He did it for, I think 12 years, as a si
deline, unpaid. But he has been in Œ in  
some form of Œ of broadcasting all Œ all 
his life. Well, where were we? Yes, my 
wife
 Alice
, who came for a year, stayed fo
r 36 years. She became an 
administrative officer, and her Œ by now 
there are few people left who remember

her, but there are some , and wh en we go th
ere for some function, or if we meet 
somebody by chance, she would Œ was litera
lly a legend in that organization, 
because having been a Œ a Œ from a child
ren™s transport, yo
u know, and having 
been self reliant from an early teenage ag
e, she was so protective of the people 
working on the staff, that she would tell newl
y arrivals that the first thing they™d 
have to do is to start thi
nking of their careers in term
s of security and retirement 
and so on. And very  few people Œ very  fe
w young people think about that at all. 
And now there are many Œ there are many ou
t there who are thanking her for her 
being so solicitous. And she is a most rema
rkable person. She is a Œ a Œ the Œ the 
fastest at many things that I can Œ that 
I™ve ever seen. I mean
, if I Œ if we go 
shopping and I get out of the car and I can™t
 see where she is, it is because she is 
already in the house, having carried 50 
percen t of the bags and dinner is almo st 
ready. You know, that sort of thing. And 
she never hesitated to have a social life, 
to Œ to invite people, while she was work
ing. And how Œ how is
 Œ is Œ by today™s 
standards, unimaginable. 
And Œ and I Œ I don™t think Œ I mean, some of my  
children have to have Œ have 
dinner party, wh at have yo
u. Bu t to think of the kind 
of dinner party she would have fo-for frie
nds after she came home from work , and 
it was ready and delicious at the time when
 you didn™t think she had hung up her 
coat yet. It™s just a very special talent
. When we were recently visiting friends on
 
Cape Cod
, we had an  engagement to which we had to  go, I™ll come  back to that

later, and we were going to have dinner 
afterwards, at our guests™. And we had 
been talking about a continent-ental dessert th
at is Œ is a big favorite in central and 
eastern 
Europe
. And in  central and eastern 
Europe
 it™s a dessert Œ it™s a dumpling, 
either with plums or apricots. But she has 
figured out that it™s better with peaches, 
because there™s more fruit and 
the peaches are so good in
 this country, and in Œ 
particularly this year, by the way. So, she 
said, I™m going to make that for dessert. 
And they said, well do it afterwards, because
 we really have to go. And she said, it 
won™t take a minute. She had du-dumplings 
for five people ready while the others 
were putting on their jackets to go to the 
function. And so when we came back, all 
she had to  do is put them in the water, a
nd they were done, you know, I mean none 

Œ none of them could believe that she ha
d actually accomplished that in this 
extremely narrow time span. Doesn™t bother her 
[indecipherable]
. And she has 

become a most valued counselor for my activities, which of course means 

particularly the book I have written. And 
the reason I wrote that book is because I 
felt that as the interest in
 the Ho locaust and in World War II revived, people were 
writing books and telling stories that were 
horrible, and in recounting their Œ their 
stories, and I felt that someone ought to st
ress the fact th at not everybody went like 
sheep to the slaughter, but some of us had 
the fortunate opportunity to  be able to 
fight back . So I Œ and in  addition, I wa
nted to commemo rate all those who were 

less lucky that I was, because a lot of my refugee friends who su
cceeded in ha Œ in

Œ in doing sp ecial and hazardo
us duty, were killed or maim
ed or at least wounded. 
I was one of the lucky ones that came 
through without a scratch except a tiny 
grenade splinter in my rear 
end that I threw myself in house clearing, by being a 
little cowboy-like Œ cavalier about how I to
ssed the grenade. Which was partly 
encouraged by the management to be a 
little macho. Came with the job. So, I 
wrote my  first book as a septuagenarian. 
It took me years and years to do it, 
because I had no idea how one writes a book. 
But I™d always had the inclination to  
tell stories, as you can tell fro
m this interview. So I Œ I 
first wrote Œ I tried to do it 
by tape reco rding while walking the dog wh
en I™d had a heart attack. And I Œ my 
children ga-gave Œ borrowe
d somebody™s dog or something, a very  ugly 
Dalmatian. And I had to walk th is dog 
twice a day, and they gave me a tape 
recorder and they said, that way you ca
n get your Œ th e book you always talk 
about, written. And I recorded while walk
ing the dog. You can 
hear cars going by 
and stuff. And then I tried to get it transc
rib ed, because I can™t type. And I found 
several people who said they woul
d do it, and they had two co mmon 
denominators. One, they were very expe
nsive, and two, they were absolutely 
incomp etent at understanding what I was sa
ying, perhap s because of my  accent, 
perhap s because there are many proper nouns
 in there that they were unfamil Œ 
that were unfamiliar to  them. And I str
uggled. I tried to transcribe it myself, I 
found I couldn™t do it. So some friend 
said, you got to get yourself a word

processor and I did. It™s a very prim
itive machine, a word processor and the 
printer. And I struggled to learn it and 
found that every now and ag ain it would 
absolutely balk and not do what
 I told it to do. So I need
ed to call friends to help 
me to get it going ag ain, to
 jumpstart it. And I found th
at this happened so often, 
that one friend wouldn™t do it, I couldn™t bo
ther the same person, so I alternated 
about three friends and called them with 
my  emergencies, in the middle of the 
night at times, because I couldn™t stop, I ha
d to go on. And thatŒ that Œ with their 
patience and my persistence, that seemed
 to work. And then 
I talked to some 
publishers without submitting it, but I Œ I 
submitted, I think a synopsis to one in 
England
, with whom I met and he said, you kno
w, it doesn ™t all have to be true. 
And that finished it as far as I was c
oncerned, because that was precisely my  
purpose, that it should all be true. H-He sa
id, you know, faction 
is acceptable. And 
I Œ as long as you have a thrill on every pa
ge. I thought there were enough th rills 
without having to invent them. So we parted
 before we even started. And then I Œ I 
went to various people for 
advice and some of the advi
ce was good and some of it 
was Œ was not. So me people said, you mu st
 have mo re dialog, some people said 
you mu st have less dialog. So me people sa
id you mu st be sequential. And I think 
that™s true. People want to
 know how it continues.

volunteer collection interview with 
Peter Masters. 
This is tape four, side
 B,
 and 
you were telling me about yo
ur book, and th e genesis of
 your book. Let me first 
ask you, can you give me
 the title of your book? 
A: The book is called, ﬁ
Striking Back.ﬂ
 I Œ I literally polled some of my 
commando friends and other people for 
a title and they  made all kinds of 
suggestions. I can™t pin down where the title
 u ltimately came from, except perhaps 
i-in discussion between the publisher and 
myself, and utilizing, and re Œ rattling 
off all the names that have been suggest
ed. And the publisher wrote the subtitle 
modified from something th at I suggested, namely, it™s called ﬁ
Striking Back: A 
Jewish Commandos War Against the Nazi s.ﬂ
 I wanted to say Jewish refugee 
commandos, but they said, 
the word refugee has a di
fferent connotation nowadays 
and people wouldn™t know what it means 
in this context. And besides, it™s too 

long. So there it is, a Jewish refugees wa
r against the Nazis. And a Œ well, how did 
I find a publisher and be Œ believe me, 
people have asked me
 since, how do you 
get a book published, like I™m the expert. 
An d of course I Œ first time  author, and I 
Œ wh at do I know? So, the Œ the way Œ 
the way this came about was that the 
historian 
Stephen Ambrose
, who was the head of 
the Œ president of the 
Eisenhower
 Institute in 
New Orleans
, and professor at the University of 
Louisiana
 in
 New Orleans
, and the 
D-Day 
Museum in
 New Orleans
, called 
together 
D-Day 
veterans from Œ mostly from the
 U.S.
 forces, but some from Œ

106
from
 England
 and one from 
Germany
. And Œ people who had ex perienced
 D-
Day.
 And a friend in 
New Yo rk, Ha rry  Nomberg
(ph) called me, he was a 
commando friend, he served under the name of 
Ha rry  Drew
, and he said, my wife 
and I are going, why don™t you come with 
Alice
? And we decided we™d all go. 
And we had wo rk sessions and it was abso
lutely fascinating because you could 
talk to people who had been invo
lved in some other activity on
 D-Day 
that I had 
seen but never fully understood. And no
w you could ask questions, how did you 
do th is? How did these rocket firing craft 
work that were on ou
r left, and so on. 
And we all submitted atape beforehand and 
Ambro se
 told me that he liked mine 
am Œ and consid ered it to be among his 
best. And we Œ and 
th en he wrote the 
book, 
D-Day
, which became a best seller an d my
 story is in there in multiple 
installments about my  
D-Day
 experience. So I mentioned to him that I we Œ was Œ 
I wanted to write a book, fo r the reasons
 I™ve already stated. And he said, you 
mu st absolutely. And I said, don™t I need 
an agent? An d he said, yes you do, why 
don™t you use mine? And he re
commended me to his agent in 
New York
, and that 
didn™t wo rk out at all, because the man 
told me on th Œ I never met him, but the 
man told me on the phone that he was 
suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 
and it would be quite some time before he
 got around to reading my book, because 
he Œ he couldn™t in his present condition. 
That was very discouragin g. Secondly Œ I 
mean, I had notions that I™d get it out for the 50
th
 anniversary of 
D-Day
, and it Œ I

was clearly not going to make it. Then 
he said, it will require
 extensive editing, 
and he recommended an editor to me, who 
said he charged 250 dollars an hour. 
And I said, I can™t afford for you to read
 my book, leave alone
 to edit it. And we 
made a Œ an agreement that I would pay hi
m an amount for giving me advice, after 
reading some of the book. And he gave me some advice, some of it good, some of 

it I discarded, which was to be anticipated
. Then a man published a book about my  
overall unit, that is a Œ my  Œ my  commando 
unit, in wh ich I was fortunate enough 
to Œ to be able to strike back. It wa
s number three troop, 10 commando. The 10 
commando had two French troops, a Dutch 
troop, a No rwegian troop, a Po lish 
troop. I think we™ve been through that. A
nd he wrote about all of us, you know, so 
we were one chapter in that book. And th
is man had done considerab le research 
and was familiar with all the 
dramatis
 
personae.
 So I told Œ I Œ 
I Œ he offered to 
help me edit, and Œ and to advise me. 
And in return, he 
was writing additional 
books on the 
SOE, 
special operations of the 
U.S. Œ 
of the allied forces, and he 
needed research done at the National 
Archives, because it 
didn™t exist in 
England
. 
So I did the research for him for days on 
end, and found very 
interesting things 
that he could use in his book and in retu
rn he Œ we exch anged 
tapes and he advised 
me. When I told
 Stephen Ambrose
 that he and Œ that I Œ I didn™t get along with 
his agent, he said, oh, I haven™t used him 
in years. But naturally it didn™t occur to 
him to, you know, to  Œ to call me  and say 
I didn't use Œ I don™t use that agent any

more. And he said, well, there are several 
options, and one of the ideas that came 
up was that I should talk to the people at
 the Holo caust Museum. And I talked to 
Mr. 
Aronowitz
 at the Holocaust 
Museum, who had been  in publishing in a 
previous life, and he said, tell you what 
I™ll do. I-I will print out publishers who I 
think would be interested in your book. 
No w, they won™t all be big publishers, 
some of them specialize 
in military memoirs and 
that™s probably a prime 
consideration. And he prin
ted out the list and the t
op publisher on the list was 
Presidio Press 
in
 California, 
an d I sent them Œ a-and Mr. 
Aronowitz
 advised me 
that the way to do it was to telephone a
nd ask for the acquisition editor. Now, the 
average first time author doesn™t know that, 
and sends it blind. Well, I sent it to the 
acquisition editor and got a letter back saying
 we are interested in your book. First 
publisher I submitted it to. And they accept
ed the book, they 
said they print 20 
volumes a year, and they get 1600 submissi
ons. And befo re the book was printed, 
it was ti Œ the movie options were bought by 
Miramax. 
And recently the German 
translation options were bought by a Ge
rman publisher, whom I™m trying to 
contact to offer my services in case they
 need any help, because I want to make 
sure that it™s done right. Now, the book ha
s totally changed my lif
e. As a first time 
septuagenarian author, I am being asked 
to speak here, there and everywhere and 
to give book talks. The 
story I told you about the 
fruit dumplings, the commitment 
to which we were not to be late was at the 
Eldredge
 Library in 
Chatham
 on
 Ca pe

Cod
. And this is a retiree audience, byno means Jewish, and they were a 
marvelous audience. And I sp
oke for about an hour, and 
then I Œ we had a book 
signing at the bookstore abou
t three houses away. And I said, I think I Œ I have to 
finish now, so that we make it in time 
to the bookstore. And the people started to 
yell, don™t stop, keep  going, 
we want to hear more. Whic
h is fascinating, I mean 
it™s Œ it™s Œ they were really interested 
and into it and asked intelligent questions 
and I have since discovered that in these little 
New England
 towns, the library is 
really the focal point of the community. Th
at™s where people gather. I mean, it™s a 
sort of intellectual exercise. And that™s
 Œ that™s always a good sign and very 
gratifying. But apart from that, and 
I spoke to an Orthodox synagogue in
 Lo ndo n
 
where there were 450 people and no micr
ophone because I was billed as the Œ the 
Shabbat preacher, if you will. And so nobody
 could turn  on a microphone an d I 
couldn™t hold a piece of paper, because that
™s working. I mean, carrying the piece 
of paper. And so  I thought how, as a serg
eant major you would have to shout that 
you could be heard at the other end of th
e parade ground and I thought I sa Œ I Œ I 
did that when I was a sergeant, I™ll do it ag
ain. Be Œ the rabbi was doing it. And it 
work ed very well, and I was given all kinds
 of honors, opening th e ark and closing 
the ark, I was worried whether it was Œ y
ou Œ you asked earlier about my  religious 
orientation, which was Œ activity, wh
ich was somewhat marginal. I was 
Bar 
Mitzvahed
, and my  grandfather was a very relig
ious man, but he never explained 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

110
a Œ a Œ a word about Œ not even at Seder, 
he just rattled off his prayers and Œ and 
was a Œ not a teacher. Well, so I was worri
ed whether I was going to do all these 
things right in the Orthodox  synagogue, I™d never offici
ated in Œ in any synagogue 
leave alone an Orthodox one.
 And they said there w
ill be somebody behind you 
who will tell you to  do all the right things
, and it turned out it was very, very 
simple, it worked very we
ll, and I shook hands for umpteen officials in a given 
order 
[indecipherable]
 traditional. I also spoke at a Reform synagogue to largely 
veterans. And there is an a-am
eric Œ an organization called 
AJ EX
, the Association 
of Jewish ex-Servicemen and Wome
n. And they organized that in 
Ed gware,
 a 
suburb of 
Lo ndon.
 And I spoke there, and when I finished Œ ag ain, marvelous 
audience, the Œ there wer-were questions 
and one man stood up in the audien ce 
and said, you say your missi
on is to spread the word th at you didn™t go like lamb s 
to slaughter, you are accomplishing that
, I trust. But you are accomplishing 
another mission that you don™t even know 
of. And he held up a British army pay 
book, which every so ldiers carries. And he 
said, this is my uncle™s pay book. I™m a 
memb er o f  th e 
Sachs
(ph) family of Œ of refugees from 
Germany. 
And my uncle 
served under the name of 
Seymour
 in your co mmando troop. And until we read 
your book ju st now, the fami ly did not 
know what happened 
to him beyond the 

war office telegram saying that he was k
illed in action. In your book you say that 
i-in the night assault crossing of the river 
Rhine
, you were in a amphibious track

cra Œ vehicle called the 
Buffalo
, and that the 
Buffalo
 next to yours in mid-river 
was hit and burst into flames, and that n
obody got out alive, as far a s you know. 
And two of the people on it, you say, were 
Fogel
(ph)
 
and 
Sa chs
(ph) who served 
under the name of 
[indecipherable]
 and 
Seymour
. And this is the first time we 
found out what happen
ed to my  uncle. And that brings
 closure to our feelings and 
we thank you for it. And people in the 
audience started to cry, and it was very 
emotional, and I felt that it someh o w made 
it all worthwhile to have done this, and 
struggled  to write the book and to do th
is. And that™s by no means all. I had the 
phone call from a woman who said that her name was 
Claudine Schindler
. 
Actually
 Claudine Arbour Schin-Schindler
. And she had seen the article about 
me that was caused by
 my book in the 
B™nai B™rith 
international magazine, th-the 
monthly. And it said that my  name  had been 
Arany
, and her name had been 
Arany
, and were we related? And she started 
to lay out her family. And she is the 
granddaughter of my  father™s oldest brot
her, who was a Œ quite a character, in fact 
the name 
Arany 
was invented by him. The 
family name had been 
Freed
(ph) but 
on Œ being in 
Hungary
 he wanted  to have a Hungarian name, and what™s mo re, he 
was a sort of macho character who in the 
20s wore a black leather jacket and rode 
a red Indian motorcycle. And my father 
imitated him in almo st everything, his 

older brother. They were both jewelers. 
Arany
 in Hungarian mean
s gold, so it was 
sort of a pun to have that name. And in  
addition, it™s the name of the national poet

of 
Hungary, Arianosh
(ph), and aristocratic, he want
ed  tha Œ obviously. And he Œ 
he was divorced from a very nice woman 
whom I knew much better than I knew 
my  Un cle
 Carol
(ph), 
Ilsa
(ph) who ran a Œ a pensionne in the country that 
belonged to some very wealthy relatives 
of hers. But she was sort of the poor 
relative. Lovely wo man, who invited us 
as children a couple of times to this 
pensionne in the country and I have very ni
ce memories of that
. We had to be on 
our best behavior because of all the el
egant people there. And she had two sons,
 
Aussie
(ph) and 
Jurry
(ph)
 Arany
, and apparently they got out. We were not in 
touch. And they got out and lived in 
France
 throughout the 
war, running from 
place to place in hiding, as people did who survived in
 France.
 And th en one of 
them got Œ oh, in 
France
 they changed the name
 Arany
 to  
Arbor
, spelled like the 
English word arbor, but pronounced 
arbo re
(ph). And one of them got to 
Brazil,
 
and then  got the rest of
 the family, postwar to 
Brazil,
 and some went on to th e 
United States. 
And this woman was terribly excite
d about having found a relative 
because she didn™t know that she had any re
latives at all. And her father is dead, 
and so is her uncle, the two sons of 
Carol
(ph) and 
Ilsa
(ph). And sh e said, I will 
tell my brothers and they™ll probably call 
you. And the next day I had a telephone 
call from
 B razil, 
from what is after all a first cous
in once removed. And they  are 
all coming Œ he is coming to 
America
 in No vemb er, and he™ll rent a car and bring 
down  as many of the family as he can. And 
as I said, all very, 
very  excited. So I

found some close relatives I didn 't know 
I had. I mean, I knew they existed, but 
that™s the next generation, you see? The 
generation after. And the Œ th-th-there are 

three grown children of the wo man in 
New Jersey
, and the Œ the youngest just 
graduated from college. And I did know at on
e point that I thought th e two sons of 
my uncle had gotten out, because in
 London
, in her apartment building, my 
mother needed some
 wrapping paper once, and 
she borrowed it from a Mrs. 
Buerger
(ph) who was living at the other end of the corridor. And Mrs. 
Buerger
(ph) gave her a used piece of brown wr
apping paper, that™s all she had on hand. 
And on it was the name  of one of these 
two boys, cousins. But my mother, being 
divorced from my father, had no interest 
in taking up a relationship, and she just 
reme mbered the fact that she had seen the na
me , and so ma ybe they got out, she said, and 
I s Œ I said, ask Mrs. 
Buerger
 whether she knows these 
people. And nothing ever 
happened, it Œ it ran off into the sand.  
Q: How has your book been received with respect to sales? 

A: I have had nothing but excellent reviews. So
me of the ma j or papers have not reviewed 
it. The Œ and Œ and you learn a whole new th
ing, you know, about what to Œ what did I 
know about publishing?  A wo
ma n ca lled me  from ﬁ
The Wa ll Street Journal
,ﬂ saying I 
review books for ﬁ
The Wall Street Journal,ﬂ
 but they devote very
 little space to it. I 
loved your book, but Œ and I wrote a review, 
but it ma y not appear. And, it didn™t, 
because there are lots of books
 and limited space and that™s how it is. And the publisher™s 
weekly pub Œ which guides libraries, published it 
very favorably, and suddenly at the be Œ

be Œ beginning of last months, the ﬁ
Jerusalem Postﬂ
 reviewed it, with a very, very good 
review. And the Œ it Œ it suddenly rekindles a 
Œ you know, like Œ like a fire that dies down 
and then catches a Œ a flame anew, t his goe
s on and on. And I get phone calls and letters 
from people all over the world. I had 
a letter Œ a-and a Œ a tape Œ a 
CD
 fro m 
Australia
 
from a ma n who said he is sending me  a 
CD
 of the song, ﬁ
The Bells of Aberdovey,ﬂ
 
which is where we trained in 
North
 
Wales
, and I knew of the song. I™ve forgotten how it 
goes, but I Œ I reme mber it from that time. And 
he said, I am the firs
t tenor on this record, 
because I am Welsh. I live in 
Australia
 now, but I thought you mi ght
 like to have it. So 
he sent me a 
CD 
of ﬁ
The Bells of Aberdovey
.ﬂ I mean, as I say, weird things happen all 
Œ all the time. And various friends whom I Œ with whom I had lost contact have contacted 
me  because they™ve heard of Œ seen the book and Œ and sought me  out, or they wrote Œ or 

they wrote to the publisher to forward ma il to me
. One of my best frie
nds is the son of an 
Austrian matinee idol who Œ 
Hubert Marischk a
. His name  is 
Franz Marischka
 and he 
lives Œ he was in the Pioneer Corps with me, he lives in 
Munich
 now. He came to spend 
the day with me in 
London 
fro m 
Munich
 especially. And he is the grandson of 
Victor 
Léon
 who wrote the

elous day comp aring notes. I 
would never have recognized him, he is a

dashing, blonde, young movie actor when I knew

that happens all the time.  

Q: What is the status of the movi
e that™s being Œ that was optioned

A: The status of the movie ma y be known to 
the moviemaker s, a-and Œ and I Œ not even 
to the publisher, because the publisher handed it to the 
William Morris 
Agency, who 
acts as his agent, and o-other than my having 
a contract with the publisher for a portion of 
subsidiary rights, lest anyone thinks that Œ we
ll, one of the English papers wrote the last 
paragraph in a review saying, and 
Peter Mast ers
 sold his book, ﬁ
Striking Back,ﬂ
 to the 
movies for a million dollars. We ll, don™t you be
lieve it. First of all, there™s no million 
dollars. Secondly, the 
William Morris 
Agency
 
gets 10 percent off the top. The publisher 
gets 50 percent of the rema inder. That™s al
ready si Œ more than 60 percent if you take 
then off the top. Then my Œ my daughter 
Kim
 who covers 
Hollywood
 told me, you have 
to have a lawyer when there™s a mo vie cont
ract. And I said, why, naively. And she said, 
try to go it alone and see what happe
ns to you. So I have a lawyer in 
Hollywood. 
He gets 
five percent, okay?  Then 
they bought the movie option, that doesn™t mean they are 
ma king the movie just yet, although they 
assigned a writer and a producer, which is 
promising. But I haven™t seen a piece of paper,
 but when I ask I am told it™s a done deal. 
So a done deal is a favorite expression in th
e publishing business. Now, people expect me  
to tell them how to
 get books published 
[indecipherable]
 and I used to say, look, I™m a 
novice and I don™t know and that didn™t seem 
to ma ke the m very happy, they thought I 
was hedging. So after awhile 
I decided I would try and give them more of an answer. 
And so I came  up with the following for mula.
 And they send me  ma nuscripts, okay? So I 
said, it takes three ingredient
s. One, you have to have an unusual story, because no ma tter 
how moving your story is, if it is one of 
ma ny, the chances are it 
will not get published. 
So, an unusual story is one. Numbe r  two, you have
 to be able to te
ll it reasonably well. I 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
116
mean, you c a n be edited and helped, but r
easonably well. And the most important 
ingredient is the third one, and that is luc
k. Because I don™t know, I mean, I feel I™ve Œ as 
I say in my book, I™ve been lucky all my life. Lu
cky to get out, lucky to be able to get 

into 
England
, lucky to be able to join the army, lucky to be able to get into an elite 
assault unit and be able to fight back. Lucky to
 survive that. Lucky to be able to get my 
book written and accepted by the first publisher. 
Lucky to have the movie thing, lucky to 
have all the other things that are happening in
 conjunction with it. So, 
that ™s what it ta Œ it 
takes as far as I™m concerned, and look, if th
e mo vie doesn™t turn out as I would hope it 
would, or isn™t ma de bef Œ as long as I live 
Œ I don™t know how these things work Œ my 
wife 
Alice
 points out, you™ve done your thing, 
you™ve written your book. Right now there 
is a debate raging about Œ raging is perhaps an
 overstatement. But one of the me mbers of 
my troop, who was in combat very briefly because he steppe d on a mi ne and lost a foot  in 

Italy, 
so he was out of it. He continue
s his law studies, became a judge in 
England
, 
which isn™t bad for a Jewish refugee boy from 
Europe
, and he™s now a retired judge. And 
he picked up the ball as it were, when 
my book came out and he wants us to contribute 
money to a monume nt in 
North Wales. 
And the Œ to my utter shock, the words on it did 
not include the word Jewish. So I started a 
sort of agitating, lobbyi
ng campaign to enlist 
support of ex-me mbers of the troop or widows or 
fa milies to insist  that it does include the 
words Jewish. He Œ the judge went so far as
 to say that my saying a Jewish commandos 
war against the Nazis in the subtitle wa s a 
blur and a s Œ and the flaw in my  book. And 
after I got over the shock and Œ and told
 him off about ma king such an excessive 
statement, I had quite the time writing him a 
letter saying, having been a judge I suppose

117
you feel you must be judgme ntal
 in some  direction. I am sl
owly beginning to understand 
where this come s from, and it™s very 
simple. First of all, this is not 
America
, where we 
have just  finished talking about the fact th
at 50 years ago there was overt anti-Semitism. 
It has become unfashionable as 
I say Œ as I put it. It™s, in 
sophisticated circles equally 
unfashionable in 
England
, but there is the fear of it am
ong Jews in Britain, apparently. 
I™m Œ I™ m Œ and here™s the thing. When we were first changing our name s and becoming 
a different pe rson, that was rather fun for mostof us, because having been a hate object in 
Germany
, 
Austria, Hungary, 
having been a poor refugee, as most of us were, having 
been in the labor unit, which was the bottom of t he army, becomi ng an elite unit me mber 

and wearing the green beret and the parachut
e wings for which we had qualified, and then 
knowing we were risking consid
erable Œ our lives, o-our limb
s, carried with it a certain 
satisfaction and pride. And to be a different
 person, I mean, I Œ I became ultimately, well, 
a commando, a comma ndo sergeant, an officer in the 
Oxfordshire
 and 
Buckinghamshire
 Li ght Infantry, a good regime nt. And I am 
Peter Masters 
and Œ and 
gone is the refugee 
Peter Arany
, you see?  Now, some  of them relished that so much that 
they didn™t want to step out of it because th
ey felt it would be stepping back. And so, to 
my utter shock, one of my friends in 
Edinburgh 
where I spoke at the Church of
 
Scotland
 church hall, and a classm
ate of mi ne from grade sc
hool invited lots of people 
and arranged it so I had a very nice audien
ce. Yet, a commando friend of mi ne in 
Scotland
 didn™t invite anybody. And I 
suddenly realized that th
e reason he didn™t invite 
anybody is because it would have blown his c
over, now. Because he has a Scottish name . 
He has very little accent, much less than 
I do, and I suppose he can account for that by 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

118
our cover story where he was aw Œ brought up or
 some thing. He is the president of Œ or 
was, of the local rugby club. And if Œ if he Œ 
if he invited people to some thing called, 
ﬁ
Striking Back: A Jewi sh Commandos War Against the Nazi s,ﬂ
 and he was one of 
the commandos, the thought would occur to th
em that he too is a Jewish commando from 
Europe
, and he doesn™t want to be. And the ju
dge probably doesn™t wa
nt to be anything 
except a retired judge. And that goes for qu
ite a fe w. Now it doesn™t go for everybody. 
The widow of my friend 
Harry Nomberg
(ph) says who Œ whose name  is Œ is 
Beatrice
 
Nomberg
(ph) and she is from 
Argentina
. Catholic, and 
Harry™s 
dead, died recently. 
And she says 
Harry 
wouldn™t have wanted it any othe
r way but that it says mostly 
Jewish. And the judge says that
 was not a prerequisite for jo
ining the troop. It was not in 
the criteria that qualified you 
and I said, that™s true. But 
where would they have found 
German spe a king people who wanted to do spec
ial and hazardous duty, if it had not been 
for refugees that were Jewish and Germanspeaking. And he says, well, some  of the m 
were Œ were not Jewish. They were half Jewi
sh or they were baptized, or they were Œ 
they didn™t even know that the Œ part of th
eir fami ly was Jewish. And I said, the Nazis 
knew.

Holo caust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Peter Masters.
 This is tape five, side
 A.
 We have talked 
about a number of different things over th
e hours that we™ve been togeth er, and I 
would like to go back  and finish  up some Œ 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
119
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ bits of unfin ished busin ess. 

A: Sure. 
Q: Let me go ch ronologically. In your pr
ofessional life we got as far as, I think 
about 1984. Can you pick up your 
professional life from that time? 
A: Sure. In Œ in 1984, I retired
. It was the earliest t ime that I could retire, and that 
always brings with it certain f Œ financia l disadvantages, but I felt it was high time 
for me to get a Œ get out of wh at had be
come a rather difficult thing. The time of 
enthusiasm that we had had in the Œ in
 the poverty program was long gone. Even 
the transformation into wanting to take 
on the Œ the mu sty look of govern ment and 
try and brush it up into something more
 contemporary and positive, that was 
beginning to  ebb away and the fights were
 more frequent than Œ than the Œ the Œ 
the challenges. And there were various Œ I 
Œ I Œ that™s another thing in that period 
of govern ment, and that is that you can ha
ve an  administration, a government with 
which you agree politically, but the person in
 charge of your agency may not be at 
all conducive to doing any positive things in  Œ in what I considered my field and 
my  charge. Or reversely, you might have 
an  administration that is unacceptable 
politically to you, and you have no choice
 until next election as it were, and then 

you may lose. And the Œ a-and yet it might 
be possible to do some positive things 
because you have somebody w
ho is interested and who ca
res. Now, in the overall,

120
in order to improve, and there have been 
conscious efforts of 
bringing good design 
to govern ment, not always, what shall I sa
y, enlightened effort
s. But there were 
times when 
Nancy Hanks 
was in charge of Œ of the endowment, and she had a 
way to get around politicians that was admi
rable. And in Œ so Œ so  there Œ there 
were times when  it Œ wh en one had the fe
eling that something worthwhile could 
be accomplished, and there were other tim
es when it seemed utterly hopeless. 
Utterly hopeless. And we Œ I Œ I rememb er Œ I reme mb er trying to  get Œ to come 

up with a formula a-and saying, well Œ o-or 
Œ at least an analysis, a diagnosis of 
why things were so hopeless 
at times and it is because th
e government is ma de up 
almost entirely of lawyers.
 All right? Now, I have nothing against lawyers per se, 

but with the very speciali
zed met h odology of American
 education, unlik e some 
European educations, whic
h in my  opinion emphasize general knowledge and a 
general sort of Renaissance view of not 
knowing only your subject, but also the 
arts and literature and music and somethin
g of a-at least basic something. This 
does not necessarily hold in
 this country. And it™s pe
rfectly possible to be a 
brilliant lawyer and have absolutely Œ if
 Œ if you were asked to name three 
American sculptors, they couldn™t do it.
 Which is astonishing, you know? There 
have been some wonderful ones. Bu t I me
an, ap Œ quite apar
t from that, perhaps 
the size of the country  is counterproductive to
 this kind of thinking because if you 
ask me to name an artist from every of th
e 50 states, I probabl
y would have a very 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
121
hard time, because well, b
ecause I Œ and Œ and you see, there are layers of 
knowledge. There are people who know a 
lot about a subject, there are people who 
know a li Œ a bit ab Œ some, and there ar
e people who know a little and then there 
are people who know nothing. And it™s perfec
tly possible to be prominent in one 
field in this country and know nothing a
bout the others. It™s a bit shocking, but 
then there are many shocking th ings like th
at, culturally. I Œ I Œ one of my favorite 
examples since I was in 
Japan
 a few years ago is te
ll me somebodywho knows 
anything Œ anything about Japanese 
culture, who learned it in school. Thi Œ 
anything besides ﬁ
Shogunﬂ
 and ﬁ
Madame Butterfly
.ﬂ Anything about the 
background of an ancient cu
lture, you see? And we don™t 
learn it in school, I guess 
it™s assumed. I mean, unless you™re a speci al ist, because  perhaps it™s assumed t h at 
there is so much knowledge
 out there that you can™t know it all. Computers can 
change that a bit now, because you can, if
 you™re at all interested, you can look it 
up in  the internet and it™s pro Œ no doubt in 
there. And I wonder to
 what extent that 
will spread a degree o-o-of feeling, of 
general knowledge? No
w, when Œ if we 
don™t have a president one
 day who really cares 
about the arts, beyond th e 
Kennedy
 Center Awards, do you 
think that Œ that the arts will flourish all by 
themselves a-as congress enc
ourages sponsored  by corporations, rather than by the 

endowment and so on? This is a very tricky 
subject, you see? It da Œ it Œ some of it 
isn™t going to happen . And if you look ba
ck , historically, whether we have had any

122
arts in Œ in top positions; there™s 
Thomas Jefferson,
 who was in his own right, an 
inventive, creative min d  that I think overlapped into the arts
 and certainly into 
architecture. What he did at
 Monticello
 and at the university i-is Œ is admirable. 
Can you think of any othe
r ones? You see, you Œ I pr
obably don™t know enough 
about some of the interv
ening ones, but Œ but cert
ainly, I mean Œ okay, 
Rockefeller
 was an art collector and he was vi
ce-president. Whether he collected 
Œ I don™t know his mo tivations. 
Mo nd a l e™s
 wife was into ceramics, all right? 
Jackie
 was into Œ int Œ into interior de
coration, all right? But Œ but going 
backwards, do you think th at 
Carter, Bush, Reagan? 
Well, into movies. 
Eisenhower, Kennedy?
 Blank. You see, I mean, an interest Œ 
Humphrey 
was 
very interested in photograp hy. We did 
a big photo exhibits when  I was in the 

poetry program that he prompted. And it 
was lovely. I took him through it and it 

was marvelous how perceptive he was. But 
you see, we are not going to  elect an 
artist or even an art collector president, 
it Œ as it stands. And then  th Œ and I think 
that it would take a strong hand to do some
thing to Œ i-i-in f
act, let me backtrack 
that 
[indecipherable]
. It is marvelous that we are doi
ng as well as w e are, because 
the point Œ the center point of th e arts ha
s actually shifted to this country from Œ 
from 
Europe
, from
 Paris
 to 
New York 
and perh aps 
Los Angeles,
 I don™t know. 
Chicago. 
And Œ and we are doing amazingly we
ll considering that Œ that what I 
just said holds true. An
d when I applied for my 
Fulbright
 you may recall, my

123
principal, a Scots painter said they 
are in their Elizabethan age in the 
United 
States, 
artistically, culturally. Meaning the first 
Elizabeth
, right? So, we are doing 
remarkably well, we could 
be doing much better still, wi
th more encouragement, 
with less sort of redneck small town attit
udes about the arts be
ing on the border of 
something questionable, and 
sinful and not quite reputable. Which is what we are 
seeing every time the endowment happens to
 Œ to endorse, or not even endorse, 
but Œ but gets marginally invo
lved with a grant that is th
en used for something that 
is appalling and shocking. An
d of course, that™s the chance you take, to some 
extent. You can™t pre-examine and sense ev
erything you award, and some of them 
are going to misfire. So, we get some demo
nstrative art that™s a bit beyond the pale 
when  people shoot themselves in Œ in Œ in  
Œ in  the toes in order to Œ yeah, there 

was some man who Œ who cons
idered that demonstrative art, he actu ally shot 
holes into himself on the stage, or the othe
r one kicked herself in chocolate in the 
nude, and so on, and this is performance art,
 you see, but th Œ there is much in art 
that is shocking if it is new. So me of
 it is bad. Well, if you want some good, 
there™s also going to  be some bad, th-the
re has to be freedom. Now, perhaps one 
can control that a little bit,
 but the attempts have be
en made to go by local 
standards only. Well, there are some 
Noguchi
 sculptures in 
Seattle
 that the 
government, General Services Administrati
on under its arts in Œ in government 
build ings program put in, and a local congr
essman protested that these were pet 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
124
rocks, because 
Noguch i
 takes a stone and wo rks it minimally, but very, very  
beautifully. My judgment oka
y, but not only mine. And 
he thought that this was 
meaningless, and a waste. And a 
Sugarman 
sculpture in a court in 
Baltimore
 was 
hated by the judge an d the judge rules his 
court like a-an autocr
atic ruler. And he 
said it was dangerous because it offered 
hiding places for muggers who would 
waylay the secretaries when
 they came from wo
rk in the evenin
g. Well, I mean, 
these are pretty farfetched criticisms. He ju
st didn™t like that sculpture, you know. 
And maybe it was not a nice sculpture, I mean, a-are you going to love all 
sculptures equally? I heard scathing criticism of the 
Roosev elt 
Memorial. A nd 

then I Œ and I haven™t seen it yet. And 
I looked at a brochure about it, and the 
artists who were involved, like
 Ba skin 
and 
Segal
 and Œ and 
Benton
, who is the 
carver of the letters, are top notch people
. So it can™t be all bad. Oh, I didn™t 
continue that I said Œ well, 
in ™84, in ™84 I retired a
nd I took my early retirement 
and Œ and made a rousing fa
rewell speech where I told them all what was wrong 
with government and with th
e General Services min Œ Ad
ministration in particular 
and it made people blanch, but I really 
loved the opportunity
 to use the commando 
spirit and Œ in at least telling them how it 
was, which was pretty
 much off the rails 
by th at time and I was glad to Œ to get ou
t. And I freelanced and I started to work 
on my  book. I freelanced and my daughter 
Anne
 is in the same  Œ she has design 
studio, of course, it™s high tech. Sh e has two 
Macintosh 
and she does stuff on the 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

125
computer. But there are things that I Œ I 
maintain, I™m not sure she would agree, 
that I can do that the computer can™t. An
d so we work  together and she does the 
technological stuff and she has very go
od id eas, but they work  better when  we 
brainstorm together. And we do that by 
phone and in person, 
and Œ and th e last 
conversation was this morning, on th Œ a 
project she is working on. And we come 
up with Œ with very  nice
 solutions together.  
Q: I also wanted to follow up on so meth
ing that you had men
tioned before with 
respect to an article printed in
 B™nai B™rith, 
in the 
B™nai B™rith
 ma gazine. You 
had told  me you wanted to elaborate on that. 
A: 
Paula Ammon
(ph) wrote an article in the
 B™nai B™rith 
monthly magazine 
called what, ﬁ
Jewish Monthly
,ﬂ I think? And it™s an in
ternational magazine. And 
they sent a photographer out whose Œ whos
e name I™d have to 
look up, but he is 
brilliant, because he actually took a picture of 
me that I like, and 
that™s hard to do. 
He took a lot of pictures and they us
ed one, and it shows that even as a 
septuagenarian first time au
thor, you don™t have to lo
ok like a decrepit old man. 
He Œ and she wrote a very nice article. Th
ere were a couple of errors. One she 
didn™t do herself, because somebody else writes the table of conten t at the front of 

the magazine. And in th at table of conten
t, they Œ this person wrote that I had 
served in 
No rma ndy
 and 
Salerno
. And I was nowhere near 
Salerno
. But some of 
our people were. My friend 
Stefan
(ph)
 Rosskum
(ph) who served as 
Steve Ross
 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
126
was in
 Salerno 
and I think the judge who is now 
retired, with whom I am debating 
the inscription on th e monument was in 
Salerno, 
and Œ and they  were in 
Anzi o
 
and in
 Salerno
, and then in the river crossings in the Italian campaign, the 
Carilliano
(ph), the 
Isonzo
 and so on, befo
re we landed on
 D-Day.
 But I was not 
in 
Salerno.
 Secondly, the seco
nd mistake is much worse, 
it says that when I went 
to art school in 
London 
after my military service, 
I wanted to get into the 
Central 
School of Art and Design
, because I had heard that it will Œ because it was so 
anti-Semitic that it was hard 
to get in. That is totally 
untrue. She got that fir-first 
because I Œ I said that I had been  told
 it was a very competitive school and it was 
hard to get in, not a word of
 anti-Semitism is true. I made up my mind that I would 
get into the school because
 it was competitive and it was going to  be difficult to 
get accepted. I felt that I had perhaps an 
unfair advantage because I was still in 
unifo rm, and if you come to apply to a school after six years of war in a 
commando unifo rm with parachute wings an
d your medal ribbons, the chances are 
they™re gonna let you in if your work is
n™t terribly bad, I guess my  wo rk was not 
that terribly bad, although I remember sitti
ng in a life class and the very prominent 
painter who taught that life class looked
 over my  shoulder and said, how many 
times a week are you taking life class? 
And I said, three times a week. And he 
said, make that five. A sobering experi
ence. So, and it says 
then, with Œ with 
typical chutzpah I became president of 
the students union. Well, the person who 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
127
told me it was hard to get into the sc
hool in the first place was a young wo man 
who had just graduated, and she boasted th
at she had been presiden t of the student 
union, sh e was a refugee. And so I decide
d that I would get into the school an d 
become president of the student union, and I did. So  that was not with typical 
chutzpah , but I said, with the drive of an
 ex-commando, I dis Œ I became president 
of the student union. 

Q: I™ve asked you ab out your personal 
life, and I™ve asked you ab out your 
professional life, and I™ve as
ked you about social events
 in this country in the 
years that you™ve lived here, but I haven™
t asked you ab out contemporary Jewish 

history. If you would take 
a mo me nt and reflect on Œ on the birth of the state of
 
Israel
. You™ve talked about that before
, but things since the birth of 
Israel,
 the 
Eichmann 
trial, and 
Israel™s
 wars. As a refugee now living in  this country, how 
have those events impacted you? 

A: Well, I™m Œ I™m not sure I told you 
the story that after the war, there were 
annual memorial serv ices at 
Westminster, 
and when  people came out of the Œ I™m 
not sure if it™s 
Westminster 
Cathedral or
 Westminster
 Abbey, because I think 
I™ve been to one. I™m told th
ere were people recruiting. I da Œ I told you that story, 
that they were recruiting fo
r the Œ for the Arabs and Œ an
d for the Israelis because 
they wanted train the sol Œsoldiers. Well, the Israeli Œthe Israeli military effort 
appeared to me to be a continuation of th
is thing th at I was about, the Œ the striking 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
128
back mentality. And if anything, they
 underscored what I was trying to 
demonstrate, because when 
I was a high school kid in 
Vienna
, the notion that 
Jews would fight meaningful
, strategic Œ no, meaningful
 military assault actions 
seemed very farfetched. The pictures the Nazi tried to create was that Jews were 
persons that sought desk jobs in Œ in Œ 
in Œ or Œ and were ove
r intellectualized and 
physically incapab le of any 
actions such as the one requ
ired in Œ such  actions as 
the Israelis demonstrated th
ey were extremely  capable of
 doing, and we too, in  our 
way, demonstrated that we were able to 
do that sort of thing and do it well. It 
hadn't  really occurred to the world, an
d I find that Œ that Jews could do an 
Entebbe
 raid, or fight off a vast armored su
periority with mainly the spirit and Œ 
and en thusiasm and ingenuity of a dedicate
d people. So all this was very important 
to me, and it had not really Œ well, i-it wa
s novel, and it was bright and shiny. And 
I think it was wonderful that these things 
Œ th at Œ that Œ that we were gathering 
respect. At times I was appalled at the a
ttemp ted turnaround of making th at this 
was comparable to the milit
arists on the enemy™s side. 
In other words that mean-
spirited critics would say that the Israeli ac
tio ns were Nazism in the Middle East. I 
think that that is a partisan point of vi
ew, that I-I find very hard to stomach. And 
again, I have friends who are much more 
knowledgeable about th
e details of so me 
of these Israeli actions, and who when critic
ized for the politics, which of course is 
Œ is Œ is a Œ a Œ a popular pastime anyw
ay, point out th e geog
raphy. And I™ve been

to 
Israel
 once, and I stood on th e 
Gola n Heig hts,
 and I Œ I said, if it were mine, I 
wouldn™t give it up, because it means that
 they can do Œ ai
m shooting into the 
kibbutz on the other slope, 
and I obviously  would have to prev ent that from 
happening. Much  of this is outdated now 
because if the warfare is by rocket and 
missile, it doesn™t matter whether you do 
observed shooting or 
not. Nevertheless, 
the narrow waist of 
Isr ael
 is so Œ is so narrow that you find th at to give up 
territory that would make it narrower still, 
is not the kind of 
thing you want to do 
easily and without some guarantees that are meaningful. 
Q: I have heard you talk about Jewish 
resistance during the Holo caust. You had 
spoken on several occasions 
and even in your book ab
out Jewish resistance. And 
I™d like you to comment. 

A: About Jewish resist ance I™ve had some 
lively de-deb ates, mo
stly by letter with 
the Holocaust Museum people, because 
I feel that we who, as refugees, 
volunteered for special and hazar
dous duty and put our lives 
on the line, that this is 
unlik e somebody joining th e arme d forces an
d serving at the Pentagon. It seems to 
m Œ especially if you judge it by its ultim
ate results. It™s true that people were 
killed in all kinds of units here and there, but many of us were killed. Twenty of 
86 were killed. And almost all were wounded
 and some of the wounds were by no 
means min o r, a lost eye, a lost leg , th
ings from which they subseq uently, years 
later, became invalids and died. I Œ I thin
k the fact that a Œ a refugee who is, by 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
130
definition a person who escaped
, who Œ who either went 
into hiding and escaped 
or managed to escape when it was still possi
ble to do so without pretense, usually 
penniless, did not sit back and say, we™v
e suffered enough and let somebody else 
do it, but volunteered and volunteered 
and volunteered and 
overcame all the 
difficulties that it took me and my friends 
to be allowed to volunteer for risky 
things. I say we are resistance, an d they 
say this Œ by resistance we define the 
people in the forests of 
Vilna
, or the people who, in th e
 Warsaw 
uprising, and I 
certainly agree that they we
re resistance, and I would de
fine it by saying they  were 
resistance o f desperation, because if
 you are in their situation in the 
Warsaw
 
ghetto, if you are in their situatio n hiding
 in the forests and trying to  Œ to do 
damage to the enemy, y-y-
you Œ you ar Œ th is is a 
Œ a desperation move. If you 
questioned and interv iewed them as I am 
being in terviewed now,
 they would say, 
the ideal thing fo r us would have been to ge
t out if we could, if only we could. To 
get equipped and trained, tr
ained and equipped, and then
 to come back with the 
maximum effectiveness of the well-trained,
 well-equipped person. I don™t really 
want to quibble about this i
ndefinitely, because if they don™t call us resistance, 
okay. I think we were resistan
ce, that™s all. I think we di
d what we could to resist 
and Œ and were willing to take risks a
nd volunteer and volu
nteer and volunteer. 
And volunteer on top of volunteering for 
special assignments. So that gave us 
immense satisfaction, insofar 
as we survived it, and I wo
uld say ev en insofar as we 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

131
didn™t, it was a comforting thought to those 
who lay dying that th
ey had done it in 
luc Œ that they were there 
because they wanted to be. 
Q: On a related subject, I wanted to as
k you about something you said in the 
interview that you did for 
the Surv ivors of the Shoah Visual History Fo undation. 
You mentioned wh at you called reaction 
beyond reflex, and you talked ab out 
knowing that sometimes a person needs to
 take action. I was wondering if you 
could expand on that, since this is
 a follow-up to that interview. 
A: I Œ I™m not Œ I™m not sure there is very much to expand, 
but it works like this, 
and it™s a wartime thing. You have a feeling,
 at times, in Œ in situations that might 
be desperate or Œ or dangerous, or what
ever, that somebody has to take some 
action that is required to resolve the situa
tion. And you have the fi Œ th Œ and th e 
follow-up feeling of that feeling is, in 
my  experience, that you find Œ and if I 
don™t, perhaps nobody will take the necessa
ry action. That therefore you Œ you Œ 
you realize Œ and this doesn™t Œ isn™t 
a lengthy process, you su ddenly  realize 
somebody mu st do something and mu st do 
it now and nobody seems to be doing 
it, so I better. So you do it.
 And you do it swiftly and 
with determination and you 
have decided to do it and so  
you do it. And this is true 
in a great man y  things and 
has its application by an extension to Œ to
 non-wartime situati
ons where the feeling 
is, somebody mu st do something, and Œ an
d Œ and wh at Œ what Œ what can I do? 
And i-i Œ perhaps it™s entirely up to me
. Sometimes with some of my best 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
132
commando friends, I found that as I was 
thinking so mebody mu st do something, 
they were already doing it, because they
 had a similar mindset
. But not everybody 
does, and I think that to Œ to take a long 
bridge to some of our political problems at 
the mo ment, I heard somebody ask not long a
go, wh ere is the person who is taking 
the kind of action that was taken by an 
Ed Murrow
 in the 
McCarthy 
situation, by 
speaking out with authority and saying
, this has to stop. Or a Œ a Œ a Œ 
Welsh
 in 
the 
McCarthy 
hearings when he said, sir, ha
ve you no shame, to Senator 
McCarthy
. I feel that the speaking out, and s 
Œ I mean, surely an
 au thority def Œ 
an authority figure should stand up and sa
y, enough already. Su rely. I understand 
what this is all about, I understand that 
Œ that Œ and I have my  own partisan view 
of it, wh-which Œ which is irrelevant. I-It 
seems to me that it ought to be possible 
to rise about the partisan 
thing when  the damage done 
to our daily lives, the Œ the 
mere fatigue of Œ of listening to  the on
going argument about the various options 
of, and what disasters each one of them w
ill bring upon us, surely gets you to f Œ a 
point wh ere you say, enough already. I Œ 
I can™t Œ I can™t get over the way the Œ 
the Œ the media makes news.  
Q: I™m gonna pause for just a minute. You
™re making reference to things that are 
happening tod Œ you know, toda
y, in the contemporary time. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But you have not men
tioned what exactly it is that you™re referring to. 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
133
A: Okay. I™m talking about th
e Œ th e comp arisons of the present Œ wh at Œ wh at the 
media called a White House in crisis, or th
e presidency in cris
is an d comparing it 
to the 
Nixon Watergate
 situation, which I think is 
an outrageous comp arison. And 
to say that, as I heard yesterday on te
levision, this was o-only about a minor 
burglary, the 
Watergate
, and I say, it was about a minor burglary that affected the 
democratic process, the political party 
of the opposition and that there is 
absolutely no comparis
on to a sex scandal. 
Q: I™m sorry, we have to
 pause to change tape. 
[break] Œ 
continuation of the 
United States

eer collection interview with

This is tape five, side
 B.
 We were talking about comparing the 
Watergate
 crisis and the cont
emporary crisis that 
Clinton
 is having, and you had 
mentioned about the media making the news. 
I would also like to Œ to  ask you to 
comment on Œ on th e differences that you s
ee in the coverage of the White House 
ru Œ when you were working with 
CBS 
news Œ 
A: Mm. 

Q: Œ in the 60s, and you we
re in the White House with
 Kennedy
, and today. 
A: Well, when 
Kennedy
 was in the White House, I 
heard from inside people who 
had work ed there, I think th e f Œ the thing 
was that Œ the phrase, if I remember it 
rightly was a man tellin g me, well you kn
ow he has this thing about airline 
stewardesses. And I thought Œ I Œ I had no
 idea what you were talking about and 

 
Interview with Peter Masters

134
then they  spelled it out to me about
 the swimming pool adventures of 
Kennedy
. 
And you see, that Œ at that time, th is 
sort of thing was going on, but traditionally 
not talked about except in 
Œ in Œ in stage whispers, a
nd en tirely separate from all 
other considerations. Now, I-I can see 
how any moralist pers
on would object to 
the details of Œ of Œ of the 
sexual adventures of the present president. I Œ I Œ I think 
that it is of course true, that if I de
scribed you Œ to you any sexual activity by 
anybody in detail, it w ould 
sound shocking, simp ly beca
use we are not used to 
seeing this sort of thing in print, ex
cept Œ I mean, the beginning Œ le-let me 
backtrack there. When 
D.H. Lawrence
 wrote Œ wrote 
ﬁLady Chatterley™s 
Loverﬂ
 where he first called Œ u-used th
e expressive language for a sexual 
activity, that was banned and considered 
shocking. It was the first time it had 
really happened by a major author. 
James Joyce
 describes oral sex in considerable 
detail. The sug Œ but it™s not customary in 
the average novel or 
Œ or history to go 
into detailed descriptions, largely because the hint of 
Ho llywood
 before overt sex 
on th e screen, the hint is mo re powerful than
 the spelling out. It has more Œ more Œ 
i-i-it™s in Œ it™s more tastef
ul, it™s Œ it-it™s mo re genteel. That caused  some authors 
to go deliberately the other way and write it very bluntly. 
Miller
, not 
Arthur,
 but 
th Œ ﬁ
Tropic of Cancer,ﬂ 
if you recall, made it very
, very Œ spelled out sex 
references. PersonallyI™m not
 shocked by anything, I think it™s in pretty poor 
taste. And the best criticism I have fo
und, th e one that strikes me the mo st 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
135
meaningful is the one that a president shou
l Œ knowing that in today™s scenario this 
will come back at him and be publicized a
ll over the place, takes what is a Œ a very 
reckless risk in Œ in  doing it. And Œ and that
 is, to me, the main 
criticism. The fact 
that he did it doesn™t interest me  at a
ll. People do all kinds of things, some are 
mo re kinky than others. But you see, ther
e is another current 
in the present thing 
and that is, to many patriotic and relig
ious Americans, the Oval Office is 
somewhat comparable to th
e holiest of holy in the temp le, and Œ before its 
destruction. And so, if anything happened 
Œ like that happens in
 the Oval Office, 
which was presumably the am
bition of this young wo man,
 so that she would have 
her place in history, sh-she Œ th-the thing is
 that this is in a
nd of itself appalling, 
because it was Œ it desecrated the holiest of 
holy in the temple 
of the White House. 
Q: You mentioned a few mo ments ago on th e 
Œ the end of the last tape, about how 
the media makes the news. And I™d like yo
u to comment on how that has changed 
from Œ from your earlier experience with Œ with
 CBS
 news and then  freelancing 
for the other stations. 
A: Well, what can I say? 
Ed Murrow
, 
Eric Sevareid
, where are you now? You 
see, would Œ even  Œ even taking the best 
of the best of the present, there isn™t 
really anybody who coul
d hold a candle, to use a cliché, to any Œ to  Œ to Œ to those 
two men, who were serious, responsibl
e reporters. Now, we get multiple 
speculation. One of my pet aversions at 
the moment, by the way, is the talking 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
136
heads, wh en Œ and Œ and th e only credit 
you have to ex plain who they are, is a 
former prosecutor. It™s a favorite choice. Th
ere are lots of former prosecutors, of 
all Œ of all shades, you see? 
Now, I think Œ and I™ve serious
ly considered to Œ to try 
and communicate that wish to the media, th
ey ought to be comp
elled to say Œ to 
give a Œ an extra s Œ a Œ a-a subtitle unde
r former prosecutor and saying, a former 
prosecutor, a political ap
pointee appointed by 
Richard Nixon
, for instance. 
Because then you would understand Œ I me
an, I understand wher
e they come from 
by what they  say anyway, but I think th ere 
are lots of people out th ere who say ah, 
a former prosecutor. Must be a legally we
ll-informed person, you see. And some 
of them were shallow political appointees, 
ultra-partisan appointees and the least 
you could do is say, who put them there to
 be a former prosecutor, so that we Œ 
everybody can understand th Œ 
and anticipate what they ar
e going to say. No w, if 
what they are going to say is
 a partisan line, that they 
tell you. And then they™ll say 
Œ they™ll anticipate what might be done to
 counteract that. And they will say, the f 
Œ the following options, and so wa Œ in 
any case they will exhaust and dismantle 
any option before it has even been dr
eamt of by anybody. And now there is 
nothing new you are going to hear, but you
 are going to hear again and ag ain and 
again that this was a minor burglary, and th
is is not a case of sex, but a case of 
profound obstruction of justi
ce. And to Œ to me, I would 
even suggest that all these 
lawyers get together and say that perjury in
 cases of denying sexual activity should 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
137
be discounted as ca Œ as perjury. Becau
se, it™s an automatic reflex. If you ask 
somebody Œ it™s like the question, when 
did you last beat 
your wife? It™s a 
question, wh en did you last have an ex
tramarital affair? Gee, I never had an 
extramarital affair, okay? This is a reflex 
by people, and their Œ is that perjurous if 
Œ if you say, I Œ I™m Œ I mean, a per Œ it took a President 
Carter
 to say, I only 
lusted in my heart. Some of them
 go beyond lusting in th eir heart.  
Q: I have ju st one or two fina
l questions for you. First of 
all, I want to ask you, is 
there anything that we haven™t talked ab ou
t that you want to 
mention before we 
conclude? 
A: We had perhap s me ntioned a couple of 
things. Offh and I can™t think of any. I Œ 
I think that Œ I™m sure we™ll remember af
terwards wh at we Œ I should have spoken 
less of, and what I should have 
spoken more of, but there it is. 
Q: What have been
 your most significant accomplishments? 
A: Whose accomplishments? 

Q: Yours. Your mo st significant. 
A: Ha. Well, I don™t know th at I would call them accomp lishments, I Œ I™ve always 

pointed to my  apparently continuing streak 
of luck in Œ in ma
ny of the things I™ve 
undertaken. Accomplish, it™s Œ is it an ac
comp lishment to have gotten out of Œ out 
from under the Nazis? Is it an accomplishm
ent to have continued a life in which I 
was able to strike back at the Nazis? 
All these are accomplishments, if you want to 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
138
call them th at, that I relish, but I Œ I think 
they™re sort of automa
tic. It™s the sort of 
thing I felt I had to do. And that applies to
 everything. It applies to my  struggling 
and typing a book with two 
fingers, someti mes three,
 to Œ and Œ an d getting it 
done. It applies to Œ to all these th ings
 wh ich I don™t consid
er accomplishments, 
but as Œ as we said before, when you 
feel you have to do it because Œ I mean, 
maybe another one of my colleagues ha
d written a book. An
d some of them 
actually did, I think, for their own fam
ily accounts and so on. Bu t I thought the 
important thing was not to tell my family
, per se, the important thing was to get 
the word out that this existed, and 
that it did happen. So that was an 

accomplishment if you will, but I don™t 
know, I Œ it™s Œ I would substitute the 
phrase, it was something I had to do, rath
er than saying it™s an
 accomplishment.  
Q: Along that same line, what do you feel
 you have yet to do 
Œ that you yet have 
to do? 

A: Well, what do I have to do? I™m aware 
by simple arithmetic that I will not see 
my  grandchildren accomplish the things I™d
 love to see them accomplish. So I 
tried to influence them by telling them a lot of stories. As you know, I™m prone to 

do that. And I™ve just written a birthday po
em for my 11 year old grandson, in 
which I urge him to become a Renaissance 
man. And I™m si Œ when I told him that 
in person the other day, because his Œ he 
Œ he tends to have 
a Œ at present a one 
track interest in fishing and Œ and Œ fly fi
shing. He gets very sophisticated about 

 
Interview with Peter Masters  
 
September 25, 1998 
 

 
 
139
how and wh at, and he knows the name of ev
ery fish that ever swam in the water, 
which I think is very  fine. But I say there 
is even more to the 
world than Œ than Œ 
than fish, and th e great thing is to strive
 to become a Renaissance man, and th en  
relax with his fishing rod, and think ab out 
the great things that he has learned in 
other subjects. So, if I could guarantee that
 I can g Œ influence my  grandchildren to 
lead meaningful lives, that 
would satisfy me no end. 

Q: I would like to thank you 
very much for spen
ding so very mu
ch time with me 
to do this interview. And th
