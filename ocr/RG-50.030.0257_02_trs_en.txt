Questi on:   Coul d you tel l  me yo
ur full  na me  a gai n pleas e?  
An swer:  My name  is Norbert Wo
lheim.  I was born on April 
26th, 1913, in 
Berlin, Germany. 
 

Questi on:   OK.  Norber t, where 
we left off, we were tal king 
about Ausc hwi t z a nd you ha d been  
descr i bi ng it s _____.  There were 
some stori es a bout Auschwitz t hat
 you ha d wa nte d to shar e wit h  
me  in particular. 

 

Answer:  Yeah.  I think in in 
connection with the with the daily
 que s tion we wer e  confr ont ed  
with...how do we 
s urvi ve , beca use once a ______ asked me 
I should tell him so
mething about the 
art of survival, and the answer is their is no art,
 so I will...in Au
schwitz it was an 
accident, or a 
chance.  Uh certai nly you had to ha
ve the t he wil l  to sur vi ve and I mu
st say after the 
first couple of 
wee ks  or  months , where  very oft en I 
wa s c onfr ont ed wit h t he que stion, 
will I be able to make it, or  
should I rather uh uh uh 
put  an e nd to my li fe in or der t o be  
liberated from the mi
se ry, but  the n a fte r  
one  ye ar or  so when I got the bette
r job and c oul d wor k a s a wel der , 
a nd also was a bl e to uh to uh  
get some additional food here a
nd there for certain activities, fo
r instance, when I was was uh  
appoint ed a bed- ma ke r a nd a nd al so when I was appo
int ed t o  be the s ecre t ary of t he bl ock i n or der  
to  keep the recor ds, t hat gave 
me a chance uh then t o
 t o uh some how ke ep 
mysel f cleaner and and  
uh als o t o...my my _______ 
I  wo uld  say  was  was  stren gth
ene d  by by by t ha t... 
 

Questi on:  How di d you...ca n you 
tell me  about becoming...how  di
d it happen that 
you beca me the 
secret ary of t he block?

Answer:  Well, uh because I I I he
lped out to a certain extent to 
uh to uh t o  uh...for i nst ance , whe n  
there was...when food 
wa s dis t ributed, you know, t here was 
a c ertai n orde r ha d t o ha d to be  
established.  I was able 
with my school French, for instance, to
 s pea k to t he Gre ek pris oners, people  
fr om Gre e k who spoke  only 
Gr eek a nd Fre nc h.  That  was ...or  or 
or Lati no (ph).  Latino cer t ainl y I  
didn't know, but my Fre nch wa s go
od enough t o communica t e wit h 
the m,  or also wit h  the pe opl e  
fr om othe r c ountries  in order so 
that  that uh ______ I  was  trying 
to hel p and the n obviously th e  
secret ary uh uh who was doing the wo
rk befor e left , so I was aske
d to do it and a
nd I accepted it  
gladl y bec ause uh I didn't be come  a n
 officer of the of the barrack, bu
t at l east it  gave me a certai n 
cha nce t o to to i mpr ove, which was...i mpr ove , 
you know, and and and a n
d uh what ever i mpr ove  
me ans , you know...c ondi tions some ho
w.  Uh so t herefore as I  say, 
the the the uh the chance to t o  
survi ve , the cha nce that, call it that
 on the morni ng you di dn't know i f
 the e v ening would be yours or  
in the evening when you went to
 bed, not to be sure that th
e next morning 
you were still 
alive...so mehow turned more
 into the positive angle. 
 You wanted to survive.
  You wanted uh to to  
to s urvi ve a nd and rea c h a nor ma
l world agai n, at least t hat 
was my  feeling to, as  ______ 
for mul ated it  once, t o te
ll the tale, to tell the wo
rl d this i s...a nd and and be ware of i t  tha t  it shoul d 
never happe n agai n, a nd there were ma ny, many face ts
 of that.  I think I told you last time , for 
instance, about the role the British
 pri s oner s of war  playe d to help
 to str engthen our morale uh a nd  
wh en they came, they gave us courage.  Uh uh 
I  had...I thi n k this we covere d alre ady...I had t he  
good for t une  to begi n...to 
become t heir friends, so they shared
 the news with me which they got  
illegally with their re
ceiver, so we knew that 
certainly the war for Germa
ny was lost and especially 
aft er t he sec ond front ha
d been est ablishe d i n Fr
ance, that it was only a 
matter of time, and th e 
que stion onl y wa s, woul d we be ab
l e  to hold out t hat long a nd certainl y we  kne w that t he Ger ma ns

uh we re wer e loosing at the e ast
er n front and e ve r y day was anot he
r ste p  uh uh uh a nd one day  
hope full y t h e east ern front would wo
uld r eac h us, bec aus e we wer e in the  e aster n part of...loc ate d i n  
the eastern part of Europe.  Uh the...that was one of the things in which the British were so helpful ,  
and als o t o provi de food and and s upport dire ctly 
uh and I wa s  also the benefi
ciar y of many of their  
good deeds and I 'll ne ve r forget a bout it.  One of 
the things which interes
ting wa s that one day a  

fellow who came...he was fr om India because his 
father was a sheriff in India in the British 
administration.  
He had never seen England an
d when we talked, 
I could tell him 
a little bit about 
my experience in London and so 
we exchanged views and so we b
ecame friends.  And he told me 
then one day...and the n a s...si nce 
our life was such a peculiar kind 
of life , without papers, without 
books , wit hout...wit h hungry for fo
r for some spiritual food al so.  Uh
 he t old me so me ho w that h e  
has gotte n s o methi ng fr om I don't which...an or ga ni
zati on in Boston, a nd I as
ke d hi m, do you ha ve 
cont act with Boston.  He said s ure
, thr ough my mil itary mail I have .  
He s aid I have a n idea.  Coul d  
you e ve ntual ly try to esta blish c ont act  for me with my
 fri end...wit h fri ends I have in Ameri ca , in the  
Uni t ed Stat es.  The addr ess I knew by hear t...y
ou know, we had no addres s book a nymore, but my  
memory, thank God, wa
s good enough.  He said su
re I will, so I formulated 
for him a letter in which 
he s aid I  met  Norbe r t her e.  He is alri ght .  He i s 
fi ne.  He doesn't know an
ything.  He doesn't know 
where hi s fa mil y is right now.  I 
mea n we had to be ver y care f ul and he hopes one da y to be abl e t o  
see you a gai n, so thi s lett er he se
nt out, a nd it re ac hed my
 frie nds, pr obabl y  a fter  months or  s o a nd  
uh i n t he closing da ys  of Ausc hwitz ...I think it wa
s alr eady i n  December wh
en when most of the 
industrial are a wa s was badly, ba dl y s ma she d a nd de
stroyed...he wa s...all of a sudden came running 
and he  sa id I  ha ve good news for 
you. I s aid what  wa s it , a not her uh
 big uh big uh vi ctor y on t he  on 
the west ern or east e rn fr ont .  He sa
id no, but beli eve it or not I got a le
tt er  back fr om your frie nds.  
Now this was someth
i ng whi ch Ausc hwi t z hadn't seen be fore , 
and I couldn't believe it so I was so  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0267

excited I I r an to t he toil et house i n in the ar ea 
where we wer e  worki ng .  Uh t he ma n wh o was i n  
char ge of t h at was also an inmat e and I said, liste
n, close all t h e doors and 
I give you...I  don't know  
how muc h I have or not have...I have  to read thi s
 letter.  And I read fr o m
 my fri ends who obviousl y 
did not  quite  under stand what wa s 
going on.  How could the y
?  Uh said well, I'm 
gla d to hear about  
Norbert .  Just assure hi m when 
you see hi m agai n that we are the 
sa me friends we wer e, beca use we  
were friends fr om the youth
 move me nt, t hat whe n th
e war is over , he s hould c o me and be wit h us  
and a nd and and a nd uh uh he uh he s hould be of goo
d..good c oura ge and s o on. 
 So when I told this 
my very close friends, nobody coul
d believe it, so I had the fortitu
de to bring this letter and to  
smuggle this letter with me into
 t he ca mp, whic h was t erribl y dangerous c ertainl y, but I wa nted t o  
show them also to 
give them some  kind of courage.  Ther
e is still...you see, can see even from 
Ausc hwitz, from behi nd the barbed 
wire , t here  i s a c onnect i on you c an establ ish wit h people i n 
Ameri ca, and uh t hen I came to t h
is  count...t o Ameri ca in '46 on a vi
sit .  Uh I saw my friends i n  
Dec ate ur (ph), Mic higa n.  The y ha d a far m t here a
nd uh uh I aske d for that  letter bec ause I wa nte d 
to to make it part of my muse
um, and they said uh n
o, they will never give 
it away, because...but 
what they...at this 
time when they got the le
tter, they were completely
 puz zled.  They said, for 
goodness s a ke how ca n he be ...t
he y didn't cert ai nly know which 
location it was because it was a 
military number under whic
h it was sent...how could 
it be he is a British pr
isoner of war.  Wh at 
happened to him, so they
 were completely fl abberg
asted until I explained it to
 him, to them and they  
they t hey got aware uh t hat act uall y that thi s 
wa s somet hi ng in whic h a 
British prisoner of war 
became call it the conduit fo
r  a message t o Ameri ca, 
and I  must sa y t his  ga ve me  a  tre me ndous li ft  
up a nd and a nd a nd and uh I tol d s o me
 of my friends.  Uh 
he  could har dly believe  
it, but this is what  
you could do wit h the British beca us
e there wa s this solidar ity of ma
n.  They under stood you.  An d 
they didn't accept any ki nd of anti-
Semit ism or r acism amongst th
e m, because for them t he Nazi s

were not only enemies on 
a military uh basis but 
also certainly on a po
litical and moral basis I 
would sa y.  That was one of the thi n
gs uh I cert a inly have ne ver for g
otten.  There was also...I want  
to emphasize, there we re other ways 
of spiritual resistance, 
to uh to uh no
uri sh us spirit ua lly.  I t hink 
I talked about the service.  But uh
 a  typical  exa mpl e uh  how how ho
w spir...spirit ual r esi stanc e c an  
work is thi s example whi ch I 've c
ited very often.  I met 
in Ausc hwi t z uh ver y early at my arriva l, a n  
elderl y ma n.  He origi nat ed from
 somewhere in Galatia (ph), had 
served during Wo rld Wa r I in t he 
Austrian army, and uh after t he war, after Wo rl
d Wa r I, he ha d ma de  
his way to Be rlin, ha d  
establ ished some exist ence as a 
cobbler, ha d mar ried, uh had a 
nice fami ly, and wit h  a so-cal led  
Poli sh ar...with a Poli sh accent, 
i n September 1939 and he had be
en taken a prison
er and and and 
wa s shi f ted from Buc he n wal d to Sa
xonhausen, fr om Saxonhausen to 
Aus chwitz , and so s o he ha d, 
when I me t hi m, alre ady he  ha d 
spent quite some  yea rs be hind t h
e bar bed wi re. He was a  won...a  
si mple ma n, uh a pious man, ver y reli gious in spit e of
 e ver ythi ng, in s pite of e ver ythi ng, and he s aid  
his his  pr aye rs e very day and he al
wa ys when  wh en t hin gs  we re were
 di ffi cult, he gave  us  cert ain 
quotations fr om whate ve r  he ha d to t o say well, 
uh they c annot s ucc eed.  
Uh we we r e  stro nge r in  
spirit than they.  One day...it wa
s uh uh in fall I think of '44...w
hene ver  it was , the wea t her wa s  
terrible.  There was...it was a 
rai ny day and the wi nds c o me 
blowing down from the _____ 
Mountai ns a nd we were  standi ng for a roll call  
uh and it l asted a nd la sted beca use  somethi ng 
wa s...we nt wrong, had gone
 wrong wi th the fi gures ,
 and the the people t her

fi gur es, but if it di dn't ti e in pr
operl y they...you, you c oul dn't co
uldn't be releas ed s o we wer e  
standing ther e and and and it was...
really, it was horror.  Peopl e fai nte
d a nd and and coul dn't take it  
but ne vert he less uh it went on s o uh the the t h e 
mo ment s in your li fe 
and I would seconds ar e  
mi nute s and mi nute s are hours a
nd hours are year s , and I was s t
andi ng i n my for mat ion, you know, 
at fives, next to this fr

was prayi ng a nd I  as ke d hi m,
 I said _____, what ar e

you doi ng.  He sai d as you ca n see I 'm pra ying.  I  
said but I 'm certai n you sa
id your mor ning prayers  
and for the ( cough) e ve ni ng pr ayer s, I  said it 's t oo 
early, so uh what are you praying for.  He sai d, 
well , I 'm not  prayi ng not the mor ni

ki ng for what, for t hat misery we
 are i n, for the for  the terrible 
situation, for being forsaken he re
 by Go d.  He  said you don't und
erst and.  I a m tha nki ng for God ,  
God for one thing...t hat he didn't ma
ke me li ke them, t he mur d erers 
ar ound me .  Uh a n d intere sting 
enough, a c o uple of mont hs later uh
 we had to under go one of thes
e infa mous uh sel ections.  Tha t  
me ans  whe n  there  were too ma ny pe ople  es pecia lly 
in the uh in the in the 
hospit al, uh then t he  
_____ a nd t he SS ca me to the concl usion that t h
ey shoul d uh uh...that t h
ose who cannot or were  
were too long in the hospital just should be extermin
ated, because they t hey were not worth uh uh to  
be fe d a nymore a nd and they ha d 
bec o me, in t heir  opi nion, a nuisa n

certai nly wa s an elder l y ma n and ha

that uh the selection would have 
would woul d would uh be hi s end,

already a schriber (ph), a secr etar

thi ng has t o be done .  Now i n  
connecti on wit h that sel ection I al
s o, since I was the se creta ry I cha nge d t he dates , the  birth date s,  
beca use ther e was not...we didn't ha ve a ny i nk, ju

cha nge d some of t he dates, e spe cia lly of elderl y people , hope fully t o to save the m , so and the  

selecti ons ha ppe ne d in t h is way t hat you ha ve t o

Mengele...l eft , right, le ft, right . 
 In other words ,  to die or to  
live, t o cont i nue to li ve.  And in or der  to save th
is man from this fr om this
 experience, we came t o  
the c onc lusi on t hat t here  wa s only one way out ...t ha

these  stra w sacks whic h 
were also called mattresses,
 even i f t here was a danger t hat he
 would suffocate but at least it was

seen the onl y way to do it, a nd he 
wa s an an old uh ca mp ma n and he
 knew all the tricks and so he 
said yes, I I'm willing to undergo th
is risk, so that's what
 we did.  We put him into the the mattress,  
covered hi m with str a w and when 
the selecti on we nt on
, some body el se  went 
fr om for him and uh 
uh when t hey also checked the the th
e barr acks, didn't find
 him in the in the in
 the ma ttress, so he 
luckil y survi ved and he survi ved al
so the the end of t he war and just 
t w o or  three years ago he uh he  
uh died i n New York at t he bl ess ed 
a ge of ninety- t wo.  The r e 's  anot he
r interesting uh 
uh fa cet of this 
whi ch uh _______ ha s al so 
uh des cri bed in his book, _____.  Uh 
it was I think alread y I think in the 
fall of 1944.  We all had the feeling it's a matter 
of time because we were 
aware of the event s, the 
the military events an
d uh the the second front 
had been established and th
e the Allied troops were 
already deep in France, so thr
ee of our uh uh our c o mrad
es who wer e old- ti mer s, who were alrea dy  
there for ye ars, ha d c o me  to the  c oncl usi on th
at si nce you never  know what would t he y let  
us...woul d t hey l et us li ve to see t h e da y of li bera

 because uh first of all so ma

but al so uh you ca n ne ver...c oul d ne ver be s ure 
of the population uh around Auschwitz, wh ether 
they wanted to cooperat e with t h
e Ger ma ns or not , but the y said 
we'll risk our lives.  We never 
know what what the end w
ill be, and obviously 
uh in the middle of their 
preparations, uh somebody 
had disc over ed tha t .  Up t o now 
we don't know ex
a ctly who it was, a nd uh uh certai nly t h e uh t he u h  
the uh the  uh punis h me nt and the  pe

in any ot her concentr ation 
camp, made a cruel spect

they exe c ute d pe opl e by  
hanging in public , a nd we all ha d

deat h sent ence wa s us ua lly confir me d by by _____, by the  by the Ges t apo, by t he  uh uh by 
Himmler's (ph) office in in Berli

..ca me back fr om work, we sa w 
the gall ows uh uh erected at the square where we ha
d our our our roll cal l , and we kne w that uh tha t  
uh...we di dn't know e xact ly wha t  
we saw...three gallows awaiting ther

these wer e t hese t hree fr iends who uh who uh obv

wa s...who who c oul d not  
be sa ved a nd uh we all ha d to sta nd there at attenti on and the at mospher e was terribl y te nse beca use  

most of us  knew them, apprecia
te d t h e m, l oved the m, kne w a b out  thei r c ourage  and t hei r de dica tio n 
for fell ow, for fellow i n mat es, so we were absol u
tely down and depress e d, a nd t hen t he specta cle  
began.  The y wer e led t o the gall ows and then 
one of the SS gangsters r ead the so-called death  
sente nce , which wa s confir me d by Be rlin that bec aus
e of their attempt to fl

Reic hs fuhrer  (ph)  Hi mml er ha s deci
de d that they s hould 
be put  to deat h, and whe n t he y wer e under  
the gall ows and the rope s already around t he m, one of the thr ee...
by the way uh uh one of the m is  
the br ot her of our friend Fre ddie _
______ who is very acti ve i n our a f
fairs in in Califor nia.  One of 
them all of a sudden pene
trated this deadly silen
ce with a voice which coul
d be heard all over the 
the pl ace and he said it i n Ger man.  I  will transl at e it 
in a mo ment.  He said to
...or he he cried out uh 
_______________, whi c
h means, c o mra de s, kee p your hi ghs 
hea ds ...ke e p your 
heads high.  We  
will be the last, whic
h means let uh...liberation is
 on the march, and certai
nly we will not live to see 
the day of liberation anymore but yo
u will.  And for a mo me
nt when this happen
ed we thought that 
the SS uh st andi ng on t h eir tower s, on the wat ch to
wers wit h ma chi ne guns and so on, the ot her  
guar ds uh ar me d to their teeth, woul d ope n a bl ood 
bath a nd s o but thi s di dn't happen, but  you c oul d 
see that they didn't feel good about it but it had a tr
e me ndous e ffect on all of us, a nd though it is now 
uh uh more than uh uh forty-fi ve 
years after that, we are still spea
king about it, still uh uh asking  
ours elves t he  que stion what ga ve t he m this strengt h
, knowi ng t h at the y woul d meet t heir  ma ker i n i n

mi nutes, uh to tell us don't worr
y about us, but you w
ill have the uh the th
e the chance to see 
hope full y t h e ot her worl d waiti ng be yond 
t he t he barbed wir e.  So uh uh 
you see, and this this is this  
is this is uh just amongst the ma
ny things we we know from that 
ti me , pr oof that uh phys...s piritua l  
resistance had remained in spite 
of t h e fact , and I  can say for  myse
l f al so pers onally, to sa y t hat  
well, they tried to make us a numbe
r but they will never conv
ert us into a number. 
 So this this this 
was, as I say, it was already at 
a time when when
 when when uh th
e air, the political
 air was was so 
different.  People still died uh da
ily.  There was still enou
gh victims unfortunate
ly, but when it came 
uh to t his t i me , uh uh uh there .
..i t  it...the whole, t he whole 
at mosphere ha d c ha nge d whe n  
particularl y when cert ainly 
wa s that you could f
eel  slowl y also the mil itary

Uh t his i s  when we .. . wh e n we we

 we ...what what uh we thought a fte

why don't they come also to to uh

di dn't know at this

a n d certai nly we we di dn't kno

the pe ople  what...we we ...on t he 
other  hand, pec ul i ar as it ma y 
sound, we were so glad to see them becaus e 
we were...when the att

________, t he onl y pr ot ec

comi ng a nd a n d and and ther

war, you know, you you yo u 
unfortunatel y you don't know where  it

effecti ve att ack, we wer e put to work i m medi at

t hen uh t he next uh da y, t he ne xt tar ge t  to to have t he re pair , the

..then the the morale I woul

t that they said there's 
nothing to be done anymore, so we
 were just trying to play around
 and play for time  if pos sible. 
Also uh t hen real izing especi ally

An swer:  From my  friends, from

because the nights were still pret

..so we walked uh quite some 
stretc hes for a couple of days.  
We  sa w (c ough) ...exc use me ...more

since there were also military gr
oups, military co
lumns marching 
and wal king, they certa inl y fr om t he height c oul dn't 
see that also refugees we
re there, so there were  
quite a number of ca
sualties.  The a
dvantage was that uh 
dead horses became 
a source of supply, 
especiall y for the French who knew 
very well how to get to the liver or so in order to to get some

 days alr e ady, uh stoppi ng i n one bi g forest , 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0267  
25 
 
al most ...it was just on the  day of
 my birthda y I re me mber , on t h e Ap
ril 26th, we were some where in 
a pl ace , i n a  bea uti ful a r ea but uh a n d the que sti on 
came  up should we try 
to es ca pe, but uh here 
agai n t he question was uh uh to
 whic h e xte nt c oul d you rel y
 on the German
 population. 
 
Question:  OK. So this.
..explain something, if 
you would, because I...
it was a little unclear. You 
were still then under guard? 

 

 

Answer:  Still under guar
d.  They were still shooti
ng if anybody is tried to
 get away and we were 
still...though we were...from the air 
we were bombarded, but also th
e guards were still there.  The 
guar ds uh uh wer e not ve ry happy a b out t his bec a use t h
ey were also afraid of 
their li ves, especi ally 
that that the y woul d be subj ecte d 
to attacks.  After twelve days I 
think, we were dr
iven to a point 
where it was was...all this 
area i s is forest area, at least i t 
wa s at th is t i me , a nd wh en we wer e  
walking...a real pretty we
ek I must say...I had some
 of my friends still with 
me, not to loose contact 
with them.  Uh all of a sudden 
a bi cyclist , a mot or bicyclist , a 
German with a bicyclist came and 
said t o the t o  the SS guar ds there, i diots, whe r e 
are  you goi ng.  The Ame r ica ns are alrea d y in _____ ,  
and when we heard t his , we bec a m
e alert, because we knew from 
t he si gns there that ____ could 
only be what fi ft y or sixt
y, seventy miles...
uh kilometers away, so were or
dered into a into a forest 
there to stay there for the night 
and a friend of mine with whom I 
was together fr om Auschwitz all  
the ti me, he had t he cour age to ta ke s o me horse ...t o
 to get s o me hors e meat  and we wer e trying to 
ma ke a fire i n or der t o cook it wh
ich was not easy 
because it was pret
ty wet in this 
t his forest , and  
we wer e in t he middle of preparati ons  in or der t o 
get something to eat when 
all of a sudden fro m the  
bac k of us , obviously t h e Russia n
s opened up wi th heavy guns.  
No w you have to understand we  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0267  
26 
 
later realized that we were walkin
g into some kind of a military poc
ket ...the Russia ns in t he bac k o f  
us and the Allied armies in
 fr ont of us, and uh in th
e middle of the night it 
was...no, not middle...it it 
it was just getting dark...the Russian 
guns really uh sent their shells 
and they came th
ey came closer 
and cl oser , a nd al most thr
eatening and at this
 mo me nt I sai d to my frien
d...we ...I sa w 
some of t h e  
Poli sh pe opl e, Poli sh pol itical prisone r s we had i n  
our area , s a id well , thi s 
enough, we run.  An d I 
said to my friend, I think th
is is also the time for us 
to run, so we left the th
e the fire and we left the 
horse meat and we left whatever..
.but just wh atever we could gra
b, especial ly a bl anket or so, a n d  
we ran towards a road.  
The SS was still there and wh
en they see us or saw 
us running, they were 
still shooting after us, but lu
ckily uh our name tag wa
s not on their on their 
on their bullet, and then 
all of a sudden uh we r eached an area...meanti
me it had become dark, wh
er e we wer e we were 
some how i n no ma n's land, but not 
c o mpletel y bec ause on t hat road we ha d to reac h, t h ere we sa w 
the the remnant s of t he Ger man ar my, al so tr yi
ng t o make  their wa y t o the nort h, and r e fugee s  
obviously comi ng fr om Berlin wit h 
all kinds of vehicles, fire trucks
, hearses, milk trucks...whatever 
move d, t he y  had use d, and s o meti me s put togeth
er beca us e they didn't have enough gasoline  
anymore , so they had tie d...had tie d these toget he r , 
and we then said well , proba bly t h e safest is to 
mix with these people, and after al
l, I had thrown away the the the 
t he stri pped coat a nd I took...ha d 
thrown...not thrown away 
but put it my pocket the th
e cap, so I I looked at 
least like a civilian, and  
my friends also whatever they had.
  We  mixed with the t he populati on,
 and uh so they
 walked rather 
slowly.  The r e wa s no marchi ng 
because there were hu
ndr eds and t housa nds of people , pre ssin g  
towards t he nort h.  The y  obviousl y kne w t hat t he y
 were  pr ess i ng t o war ds so
me kind of of of army  
lines, of the American ar
my or the British 
army.  Nobody 
knew who was operating 
there, so uh uh  
then i n thi s  wa y we wer e  wal kin
g the whole night.  We 
he ard some s hooti ng.  We di dn't know wha t  
it wa s.  We  wer e  ev en stuc k b y
 by some Ger m an s oldie rs and t he y sai d...a nd l uc ki l y we s poke

27 
 
Ger ma n and we sai d the Russia ns ar
e driving us out and we are goin

When they heard about th

...I mea n, when you sai d Russia ns it  
was al ways for them a cause for 
al ar m a nd  whe n we were wal kin g 
sl owly and and a nd and and a nd  
it was dawning slightly and uh so
mehow...I don't know 
whether in my...I co
uldn't sleep and you 
wal k, but  I wa s dozi ng some how...a ll 
of a sudden sudden a 
friend next to me said to me, Norbert, 
isn't t hat the Ameri can fl ag, and 
I looked up and sure enough t here 
was a bend fro m one for est are a  
to another forest area, and ther e 
uh uh uh was t he the t he the Amer
i can fl ag, stretc he d over the ove r  
the the t he crowns of t he of the 
of the trees, and uh with the with 
the uh headlights of the jeep...it 
was showing that this is now Am
eri c an-occupied territor y
 and this is wher e uh t he American ar my 
had stoppe d, beca use what we di
dn't know was t h at uh t he 8th Divi
sion of the American army had 
bee n le nt to Mont gome ry to c ut 
off the northern uh uh Germa ns fr
om t he sout her n 
Germans....from 
nort her n Ger ma ny fr om s out hern Ge r ma ny, rea c hi ng 
the city of _____ obvi
ousl y, and that wa s the  
8th Di visi on.  And but at  a c ertai n point, uh uh 
he adquarte rs proba bly had deci ded not to c onti nu e  
operations anymore because 
they didn't want to take
 any casualties anymore.

woul d like to know what 
you felt?  

 

Answer:  It was...first I I...the the 
the fir st mome nt  I didn't
 reali ze that it 's true, but uh when we saw  
that, t here was a feeling of...we we

 very danger ous because 
these were t hese were very uh fa

since  then sl owl y also ot her groups had cr os sed t h

 at  thi s food, a nd and 
and and some of the m dr opped dead
 on t he  spot .  So uh uh

With that he said I'm so

completely...completely believe it,
 though we li ve d alre

They don't want to go back to Pola

years after until until until 
uh the Belsen ceased to

 those who couldn't leave 
then found a place in Nor way or so
 for me dical reasons or other  reas

then and and I 
deci ded t hen also to leave to leave Ger many.  I wa

 t o the conclusion that  also i n 
the interest of 
the children, we 
would not st ay in Germany, and this is then when 
we  decided to to uh to 
uh leave Ger many.  Ther e 
was still another job to be done 
in which I participated and that
 was uh uh...tha
t was under the  
military statute, a so-
called successor organization was built 
to claim the heir
less and communit y 
property of the Jewish community
.  This was under Allied law with
 the seat in London and uh I  
became one of the founde

 by putti ng all the funds  
whi ch which which uh accu mulat e

which was not  used by new 
communities, and heirlessproperty into one fund a
nd uh this fund was admi

committee of the communitie
s and the major Jewish 
organizations and then 
distributed especially 
for social  purposes for needed pe
ople in Israel and in
 in America, so that was the Jewish Trust 
Cor poration and a nd a nd then I ca
me to the United States.  I land

ed, which I found out only later, in 
certai n concentrati on camps to whi p up the emoti ons
, the anti-Semitic 
emotions of the of the guards 
against us, so after I had seen it af
ter the war, I said I wonder...I I'
m surprised that anyone is still 
alive after these pe ople have seen 
it .  It was  heavy, ver y e ffec tiv
e anti-Semiti
c st uff, and he was  
accused i n Ger man court uh for cr i mes agai nst  hu
manit y, but he coul d prove that he didn't

he wa s released fr om all charges. 
Uh as a matt er of fact there was 
one one c ase  agai nst hi m.   Then 
there was was appeal an

the second court trial, I sent a letter to the to the to the president of the court saying that I refu sed to  

appear as a witness because I consid

You know, in t hes e days you di d...I

since  he wa s hi ms el f, t h at judg

 I wa s a  witne ss uh in in i n  in a case for  whic h I wa s  brought ove r

that t his t hi s is not hing bur de nsome for hi m,

he pr obably would have made it

of goodness do we expect 
from them?  So then at 
the end of it, interesting 
enough, when the judgment was wa s 
rendered, I was consi d

aft er that , when I came back, I I asked a friend 
of mine who wa s writi ng ar

so, that  I had enough, t h at
 I would never accept an invitat ion agai

he refused an d 
his reaction was as long as

he was taken to Theresienstadt

by by a mira cle  he sur vived and t his is a 
very i nteresti ng mira

  And he published one story

advise him that in Auschwitz people are being 
gassed, and he kept it as a secret
 and did not ma ke it known t o the

and I 'll writ e an arti cle and make

Unfo rtunately uh uh his.
..you know, because he 
lived at a time which was a terrible

not about Theresie nsta dt

and a nd I 'm gla d that I  
had t he opportunit y to to tell you.  Pr obabl y I c oul

belief t hat what what you are do

the ar chi ves toget her t ogether is
 of tremendous importa

the revisionists uh telling us Auschwitz wa s a hoax or
 like in that book of

to prove that Hitler did...
never knew about the Holoca

others  are ...I never belie ved i n c ollect ive guilt , a n d we ne ver

That  means t hat we all  have t o

and then there came th

what they had seen and how they ha

and that uh I think this is a formula I don't uh get it 
verbatim, that the British prisoners of war had to
