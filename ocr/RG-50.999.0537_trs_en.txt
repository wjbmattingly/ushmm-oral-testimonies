[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sus an, welc ome and thank  you s o m uc h for your willingnes s  to be our
 
Firs t Pers on
 
today. We fir st met 16 years  ago yes ter day.  You have been on an annual bas is  with us  at o
ur
 
Firs t 
Person
 
progr am.
 
 
We're going to get s tar ted.  You have s o m uc h to s har e with us  and we have a brief hour  
together.  Your  ear ly year s  wer e s pent living in the town of Bad Krueznach in Germ any.  Befor e we tur n 

to the war, tell us what you c an about your family  and their  life and your life befor e the war  began.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Ok .  I was  a ver y young girl
 w
hen Hitler fir s t c am e into power  in 1933.  I 
r em em ber my father had a thr iving store, a linen store, and he was  doing ver y well in that s tor e.
  
And all 

of a s udden he didn't have his  stor e anymore.
 
 
Can I just ask  the audienc e?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Abs olutely.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  How many of you have been in the Permanent E
xhibition
 
alr eady?  You have not 
gone to the Permanent Exhibition?  Ok .  How
 
m any of you ar e going to the Per manent Exhibition?  Oh, 
good.  So you will s ee
 
--
 
and then I'll tell you s ome of the things while I'm  talking to look for when you 
go
 
--
 
when they go to the Perm anent Exhibition.
 
 
Any way, what happened in Germany at that ti
me
 
--
 
and you're going to s ee ther e's a big 
exhibit about it, what the Nazis  did.  Fir s t thing, they didn't go and take everybody into the c onc entration 
c am ps but what they did to my father they did to a lot of the Ger man people.  They boyc otted my 
father'
s s tor e.  So he lost all of his c ustomer s .  The only people that could c ome to his s tor e wer e the 
J ewis h people.  And after that he didn't have enough bus ines s  s o he los t his  s tore.  And that's how the 

Nazis  fir st started.  They took away all of the liveli hoods  of all of the people.
 
 
We lived in a very nic e hous e when he had the s tore but then as s oon as  he los t the s tor e, we 
kept m oving from  s maller  and s maller and smaller hous e.  In that pic ture you s aw m y br other and m e 

on the s teps .  That was  already ne
ar
 
--
 
it was  maybe in 1936 or 1937.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So by that time he had los t his bus ines s .  And you had m oved already.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  So we m oved.  And every one of thos e hous es  bec ame les s elegant than 

the one before.

I rem ember, I went
 
to kindergarten.  I was  r eally excited to go to kindergar ten.  I really didn't 
like going.  And then I got to go to first gr ade.  And in firs t grade I hated going to sc hool bec aus e the 
kids m ade fun of m e.  I couldn't figur e out why the c hildr en were maki
ng fun of m e.  It tur ned out that 
the teac her r ead a book  to us
, ﬁDer  Giftpilz.ﬂ
.  The title meant a pois oned mus hr oom .  It was  a picture 
s torybook that the teac her  was  reading, teaching the kids  that J ewis h people wer e pois oned 

m us hroom s.
 
> > Bill Bens on: 
 
And here you are in the c las s r oom , obvious ly.
 
>>
 
SusanWar s inger:  Yeah.  So the kids were really ter rible to m e.  I wished that I didn't have to go to 
s c hool.  And you know what?  One day I didn't have go to sc hool anym or e.  And I tell you, I was  really 
happy.  And the r eas on I was  happy is  bec aus e none of the J ewis h c hildr en in Germany wer e allowed 
to go to s c hool anym ore to public  s c hool.  To m e it was  a good thing but this  is  what was  going on in 

Germ any.  The kids weren't allowed to go to public  s c hool. 
 
However, the people in my town, the 
J ewis h people in my town, hir ed a J ewis h teac her and he taught all the kids  in all the grades.  So I was  

very happy bec aus e nobody was making fun of me anym or e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I rem ember you telling me that bec aus e ther e were so few of you, first grade was  in the
 

fir s t r ow.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Kind of eac h r ow was  another grade.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly.  So he did it all the way to the 10th grade.  So ther e were 10 r ows
.  So 
m aybe half of this  auditor ium , maybe a little les s, all the J ewis h kids went to that s chool.  And he had to 

teac h us all of the s ubjects .  He had to teac h us  math, wr iting, reading, his tor y, and sc ienc e.  But he did 
it and we were very, ver y  happy.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you rec all, Sus an, an inc ident wher e your m other s ent you to a loc al stor e to get 
br ead but you had to go through a park  to get to that store? Will you tell us  about that?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Oh, yes .  I hope they're r eady to hear this s tor y.  Are you r eady to hear this  

s tory? 
 
 
Any way, I was  r eally, really proud.  The Germ an money, 
pfennige
, whic h is  pennies , and s he 
wanted to
 
--
 
I felt very proud.  My m other told me to go to the s tor e to buy s om e bread.  And I was  really 
happy.  Wher e we'r e s itting is  where my hous e s its  and all of the people in the audienc e here, that's a 
park.  And then at the end of the park  was  this  street whic h had all the groc er y s tor es .  I was  ver y 
happy to go bec aus e ther e was  a pas s age way through the park.  You c ould go through the park  to get 
to the end
 a
nd then go to the gr
ocer y s tor e.
  
 
 
So one day s he gave me the m oney and I got to the park .  There were s om e steps.  I s tarted 
to go down the steps.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Som ething you had done many times .
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .  Yes .  So when I got to the bottom of the steps, jus t at the entranc e of the 

park, they had like a gatekeeper.  And the gatekeeper c am e r unning over to m e and he s aid, "Oh, you 
little girl."  Then he c alled me all kinds  of hor r ible names .  He s aid, "J ews  are not allowed to walk 

through this  park  anym ore and you do not walk  through this  park  ever , ever again."
 
 
So I r an to m y m other and I told her .  You know, they always  tried to pr otec t us
, y
ou know, not 
to tell us  what the Germ an government was  doing.  I gues s my par ents thought that this whole thing 

was
 
going to blow over and Hitler was  not going to be in power that m uc h longer.
  
So anyway s o she 
s aid to me
:  n
ext tim e I tell you to go to the s tore, just walk  all the way ar ound, go up the block  this way, 
and c ome around and go to the s tore that way.  Itwas  a big walk.  
 
 
So the next time s he took me to the stor e, got to the s teps in fr ont of the park and I s aid to 
m ys elf, I am really very tir ed.  So I gues s  your audienc e alr eady c an figure out what I dec ided to do. 
 
So I walked down the steps .  Of c our s e, the gatek eeper immediately c ame out and he s tar ted to throw 
r ocks at m e.  
 
 
The bad part of it was  he had a daughter who was  jus t about m y age.  She was  a little bit 
older  than me.  And her  father, of c our s e, was  her role model.  Sinc e he was  her r ole model and she 

s aw her father doing it, of c our s e s he did the very sam e thing.  So it was  a les s on that I lear ned, you 

4 
 
know, how im portant it is for  the par ents to be good r ole m odels  for their children.
  
Anyway I never 
walked through that park  again.
 
> > B ill
 
Bens on:  Sus an, with your  father los ing his  bus ines s , how did he manage to feed the family and 
m ake ends  meet after that? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Well, what he us ed to do, he bought s trawberr ies , ras pber ries , differ ent berr ies .  
He c ar ried them  in baskets . 
 
He went to a farm er and he bought them.  And then he tried to buy them  to 
s ell them to the J ewis h people in our  town.  And, you know, the J ewis h people tr ied to s upport each 
other.  So that's  how he m ade his m oney.  He didn't have ver y m uc h left.
 
> > B ill 
Bens on:  Your  m other had a baby boy in 1938 but at that tim e s he had no c hoic e other  than to 

have her c hild at hom e.  Say a little bit about that.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yeah.  You r em em ber the pic tur e that was  on
 
--
 
m y br other and I ar e s itting on 
the steps?  She was  having m y
 
--
 
the baby br other that you s aw in my m other 's lap, s he was  having 
that baby.  She was  having it at home.  They told my br other and m e to s it outs ide on the s teps 
bec aus e they didn't want us
 
to
 
lis ten to her having the baby.
 
 
At that 
tim e, in our town at leas t, the r ule was  that no J ewis h woman was  allowed to go to the 
hos pital.  So s he had to have
 
--
 
I don't know if s he had a m idwife or not but s he had s omebody to help 
her .  She was n't allowed to go to the hos pital.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So had there been c om plic ations or s er ious  problem s, s he would have no c hoice.  She 

would have to deal with it at home.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Right.  Exac tly.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  This br ings us  that terrible night in ear ly Novem ber
 
1938, November
 
9 thr ough 10. 
 
That was  to becom e known as  Kr is tallnac ht or  Night of Broken Glas s .  Tell us  what you r emember  

about that night.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Ok .  My brother and I, we wer e sleeping in our bedr oom.  This  was  not the baby.  
The baby was  s leeping with my parents in
 
their bedroom.  My br other  and I, we wer e s leeping and we 
were really very exc ited.  It was  November
 
9.  It was  going to be m y mother's birthday on the next day.  
So it was  maybe ar ound 11:00, s om ething like that.  And all of a s udden s om e br icks  and r ocks  were 
being thr own through our window.  And m y br other  was  a year younger than I am but he was  alway s  

br aver  than me s o he went to the window and he pulled him s elf up.  He s aid to me, "Sus i
 ﬁ
--
 
that was  
m y name in Germ any.  
ﬁ
Sus i, it is our neighbors
ﬂ  wh
o 
were thr owing the br ic k s  and r ock s  through the 
window.  
 
 
I was  really s c ared.  So we jum ped out of bed and we started to cr os s to our par ents' 
bedr oom.  And just as we were c ros s ing our parents ' bedroom , s om e of the neighbors  that m y br other 

had s een outs ide had uprooted a telephone pole.  He s aid he had s een the polic em en.  
 
 
And thos e of you who ar e going up to the Per manent Exhibition, you're going to s ee the 
polic em en
 
--
 
the German polic emen
 
--
 
they had thes e blue helm et hats, blue uniform s.  
 
 
He was
 
s tanding at the cr owd.  He was  s tanding at the outskirts  of the c r owd and was  
s tanding like this.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But not inter vening.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly.  Yes. 
 
So we wer e c r os s ing to our  par ents ' bedroom.  They had 
upr ooted this  telephone 
pole.  And then our front door was  m ade out of glas s  and the glas s  was  broken 
and it was  all over the floor .  The objective was  to go to the rabbi's  apar tm ent who lived in the 
apar tm ent above us , our hous e.  We lived on the firs t floor, the r abbi fam ily  on
 
the s ec ond floor , on the 
thir d floor a non
-
J ewis h family, and on the fourth floor ther e was  an attic.
  
While they wer e going 
through our apartment, they looted s ome of our things  and brok e s om e of our things  but not too muc h.  

They wanted to get to the rabbi's apartment and evidently they m us t have des troyed many of his  
ar tifacts and m any of his  books.
 
 
My father s aid, well, let's hide in the attic .  So befor e we went in the attic
 
--
 
he had s aved a 
little bit of m oney
, a
ll the m oney that he had left.  He told m e to put it in my under wear  because he 
figured if s omebody was  going to ar rest him, if s omething was  going to happen to him , they w
on™
t 

5 
 
s ear c h a little girl.  So her e we go up in the attic  with all of the money that he had left in the whole wide 
wor ld
.
  
 
 
Any way, we got up to the attic .  The r abbi's family was  alr eady up ther e.  But the rabbi was n't 
ther e.  And what had happened to the rabbi, they had arr ested him  and put him to jail.  But before they 
did that, I looked out a little window from  the attic and I saw him  standing on his  balc ony.  There were 
two SS offic ers .  And you'r e going to see many pic tures of the SS, the Nazi offic ers .  They were holding 

him  on eac h s ide.  Another  one c ame and c ut off his  beard.  And then they hauled him off to jail.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So for  the pur pos e of jus t utter humiliation.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly.  Yes. 
 
 
So later on I found out that they didn't only do that to our hous e in Bad Kr ueznac h but they did 
it to all the Jewis h fam ilies  that wer e living in our town.  And not only that, they did it
 
--
 
they bur ned 
down our s ynagogue and they looted all the J ewis h s tores that wer e still left.
  
Then I found out that they 
did 
it all over Germany, in every town wher e there wer e J ewis h c omm unities .  And bec aus e s o muc h
 
glas s was br oken that night, they c alled it Night of Brok en Glas s , Kristallnac ht. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Hundreds  of s ynagogues were burned throughout Germ any.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yes .  Exac tly.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How long do you think  you wer e in the attic ?
 
>>
 
SusanWar s inger:  Yeah, I don't rem ember.  I was  a little gir l.  It was  maybe four  days .  Som ething 
like that.  Not a ver y long tim e.
 
 
You m ight ask  m e:  What did 
you 
eat for four  days ?  It was  Novem ber.  Our  town had all of 
thes e marvelous  orc har ds .  We 
had all of thes e apples .  They had s tor ed
 
--
 
m y parents  and the rabbi's  
par ents, and evidently the non
-
J ewis h family s tored piles  of apples  in that attic .  So we ate them.
 
 
The rabbi's c hildr en were up in the attic with us .  We wer e ver y
 
--
 
it was  ok, you 
know.  The 
kids didn't realize the horrors
 
--
 
the beginning
 
--
 
it was  r eally the beginning of all the horrors  that started 
in Germany.  But as  a kid, we didn't know. We ate the apples . We have played with the apples . We 

played games.  We pr etended they 
were balls .  We pretended they were all kinds of differ ent toys .
 
So to me, I was n't that s car ed.  I was  just a little kid.  It was  like an exc iting thing that was  happening.  

Of c ours e, m y parents knew what it
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on: What it meant.
 
> > Susan Wa
r s inger:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That night I believe some 30,000 J ewis h m en wer e arrested.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tak en to the Dac hau c onc entration c am p.  Your father was  not.  Why do you think  that 

was ?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  I'm glad you asked m e that.  I s hould have talked to my father a lot mor e 

about that night.  I know he us ed to be the friend of the m ayor  of our town.  He us ed to play c hes s with 
him .  So I don't know.  He went to jail for  just a few hour s  and then he c ame
 
up to the attic .  I don't 
know.  It m ight be that or bec aus e he was  bor n in Poland.  All of his  fam ily wer e Polis h.  And at that 
tim e, you know, Germ any
 
--
 
Hitler hadn't dec ided to c onquer  all of Eur ope yet.  This was  like the very 
beginning.  And Poland,
 
he hadn't occupied Poland yet.  And I think per haps  bec aus e he was  Polis h 
they didn't ar res t him.  So I'm not s ure.
 
 
So I want to tell the audienc e s om ething.  I was  telling m y fr iends  about it in the c ar  her e.  
Thos e of you who ar e kids  and thos e of you who ar e parents, tell your kids  everything that happened to 
your  parents and your grandparents.  Find out all the details .  Have them tell it to you pers onally.  We 
talked about, oh, you have the c om puter and you c an put it all down on the c om puter but s om
etimes  
you eras e that s tuff and it's gone.  So pas s it on from mouth
-
to
-
m outh s o that you know all of thes e 
things, s o that you know everything that happened in your fam ily. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  really im portant advic e.  Thanks for  that, Sus an.
 
 
The events  of that night in partic ular , the Night of Br oken Glas s , r eally led to your par ents  
m aking the ver y pr ofound dec is ion that they needed to get out of Germ any.  Tell us  what they did, their 
attem pts to tr y to get out of Germ any.

> > SusanWars inger:  Ok .
  
Well, you rem em ber  all the money that I had in my underwear ?  I had gotten 
it very wet bec aus e ther e was  no bathroom up there.  But we laid the money out on the floor and it 
dr ied up.
  
So anyway, my father had hear d
 
--
 
I'm  telling you this for  a r eason. 
 
My father  had heard of a 
lady that was  taking c hildren acros s the bor der  into Fr anc e.  But s he was n't doing it out of the goodnes s  

of her hear t.  What s he was  going to do, she had c hildr en of her own and s he pretended
 
--
 
s he us ed 
her  c hildr en's  pass ports .
  
She put, I don't know, our  pic tur es in her c hildren's  pass ports .  So we were 
s uppos ed to be her c hildren.  She pretended when we c ros s ed the bor der  fr om  Germany into France, 

s he pretended we were her  c hildr en.  Of c our s e, my father gave her  all of that money.  So he knew that 
we wer e going to be s afe bec aus e, you 
know, Hitler 
was n't at war  with Franc e at that tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You and your brother J os eph.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  My brother J oe.  My father, befor e the Night of Br ok en Glas s
 
--
 
and I'm tel
ling 
you people many J ewis h people didn't want to leave Germ any bec aus e they all thought, well, this  is  
going to blow over.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And it's been their hom e for hundreds  of year s in many cas es .
 

> > SusanWar s inger:  Exac tly.  Many had been in the FirstWorld War.  They were c itizens .  They wer e 
par t of Germ any.
 
 
After the Night of Broken Glass nobody, no J ewish family, wanted to stay in Ger many.  And, of 
c our se, befor e m y father wanted to stay in Germ any but m y m other always wanted to leave.  It was
 
going on like that.  They had big dec is ions  to mak e.  They had big dec is ions  to m ak e.  But after the 
Night of Br oken Glas s ever ybody wanted to get out.  
 
 
Of 
c ours e, there were quotas  in all of the c ountr ies .  So if you wanted to leave Germ any
 
--
 
and 
the Nazis  wer e happy.  They wanted to get r id of the J ews .  But nobody in all the c ountr ies  in the wor ld 
wanted to have them.
 
 
I gues s you'll find out when you go up to the Permanent Exhibition.  They had an Evian 
Confer enc e.  Roos evelt was  the pres ident then.  The c onferenc e was  let's open up our quotas, let's  

open up
 
our  c ountries.  No c ountry opened up their  quotas.  Only c ountry that did was  the Dominic an 
Republic.  You c an lear n about that. 
  
There's this big pic ture when you get up there, a big p
icture that 

was  in the "New York Tim es ."  It talks  about the Evian Confer enc e.  So make s ur e you look  at that.  It 

r eally s hows  you what was  going on in Germany at that time.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And I believe you had relatives  in the United States.  So even with relatives , bec ause 

of the sm all quota, you wer e not able to c ome.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly.  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So your par ents s ay, well, at least we're going to s end Sus i and J oe into Fr anc e.
 

> > SusanWars inger:  Into Fr anc e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  
Do 
you 
rem em ber  what it was  lik e for  you to leave your par ents, to be s ent?  Any 
s ens e of what you were feeling at that time? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I have a hard tim e talking about that.  I had pu
t it 
--
 
this  s epar ation fr om m y 
par ents, I have put it very far  back  in the back of m y m ind.  Then I bec ame a mother  m ys elf and I c an 

jus t see how ter r ifying it m us t have been for m y m om to s end her c hildren away and not know if they 
were ever  going to see them again.  So it's  a ver y diffic ult topic for  m e to talk 
about. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I c an imagine it would be.
 
 
You r emember  an inc ident on the tr ain with the wom an who they paid to take you into Fr anc e.  
I think  Germ an soldier s  boar ded the tr ain.
 

> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  My br other and I, we had to pr etend we 
were fast as leep.  We did not 
s peak any Frenc h and here we wer e s uppos ed to be Fr enc h c hildr en.  So we were s leeping.  And my 

br other tells  this  s tory.  I don't know if I ever told you this .  But m y brother tells  this  story that he thinks 
that m aybe we were drugged s o we would be s leeping or m aybe we wer e dr ugged bec aus e the 
s eparation from our parents  was  going to be s o difficult.  I don't know.  I really don't know. 
 
B ut anyway, 
we had to be very quiet.  Som ehow or  other I think  I heard them talk in French but I was  pretending to 

s leep. 
 

7 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  parents' plan worked.  You got to Par is . What happened then?  The lady 
deliver s  you.  You mak e it to Paris .
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  Here are thes e two kids .  I was 9 and my brother was  8.  So
 
her e we 
were all by ours elves .  There was a s ec ond c ous in who was  liv ing in Par is .  He was  a young m an, 
s imilar to your age.  How old are you?  22.  Yeah.  Maybe he was 25.  He had a nic e little apartm ent in 
Paris , in the Plac e de la Vendome.  So he said he'd keep us for  a while until they figur ed out what they 

were going to do with us . 
  
So we s tayed with him.  
 
 
And he had a job.  So he went to work.  He told my brother and m e to stay in his  little 
apar tm ent until he got bac k .  But my br other, I told you
 
he was  very adventurous .  He s nuck  out the 
m inute this  s ec ond c ous in left the apartm ent.  He went all over  Paris  on the Metr o.  He us ed to go 

under the sti
les .  He c ame back.  He was  8 years  old.  Of cours e, I never  did it bec aus e I was  always  
very good and lis tened to ever ything ever ybody ever  told m e to do.
 
 
So any way
 
--
 
this  c ous in c ouldn't take care of these two c hildren.  So there wer e all kinds  of 
wonder ful organizations  in Franc e that were looking out for  c hildr en.  And one of them  was  the HIAS.  
Yo
u talked about it before.  And then there was  the OCE.  They found the plac e for us to s tay in one of 
the s uburbs  of Paris .  A lady had a hous e and was  taking c ar e of c hildr en, like maybe or phans or 

s om ething like that.  So we s tayed with them.
 
> > Bill B en
s on: Was it jus t J ewis h or phans or jus t orphans in general?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  Maybe 10 lived in her  hous e.  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you wer e there for a little while.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .  And now it's May
 
1940.  I gues s you all know
 
--
 
you probably lear ned in 
s c hool
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you tur n to that, Sus an, tell us  when you wer e at that hous e
 
--
 i
t was  not a 
happy experienc e.  Can you s ay a little bit about that? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Ok.  This  was  the fi
r st hous e we were at.  
She was  M
adam  Zalits ki.  She had a 
daughter.  She favor ed her daughter and all the children that s he was  taking c are of.  I'm s ur e 

s om ebody paid her to take c ar e of us.  She tr eated us  very poor ly.  She
 
--
 
they wouldn't let us go in the 
hous e to eat.  We h
ad to go in the outhous e to go to the bathr oom.  She didn't give us  the good, s ame 
food
 
as s he gave to her daughter.  She had a husband who s he bos s ed around.  That's who we 
learned how 
to eat pon frietes , fr enc h fr ied potatoes .  He would give s om e to his  daughter but he 
wouldn't give any to us.  You r emember  things  lik e that. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you were only allowed to be in the hous e to s leep.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  To sleep.  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that was  on s tr aw.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .  We
 
c omplained to the s ec ond c ous in.  He found us  another plac e.  There 
were two ladies .  She took  c ar e of different c hildren.  She was  very good to us . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Then what happened fr om there?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Well, it was
 
--
 
we wer e, again, s leeping in our bedroom . We us ed to look out the 
window.  We us ed to s ee Ger m an planes  bombing
 
--
 
they didn't bomb Paris  but they bom bed the 
s ur r oundings of Par is .  Becaus e, you know, by this  time Hitler had s aid I'm going to tak e over  all of 

Europe.  He hadgone into Poland, Lithuania, Czec hos lovakia.  So his  next objective was to get into 
Fr ance.  So he was  bombing the outskirts of Paris .  We us ed to look  out the window and we us ed to 
s ee them  bom bing.  So we knew what was  happening.
  
Well, anyway, in J une the Nazis  c am e 
m ar c hing into Paris .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you had to leave Paris  at that point.
 
> > Susan War s inger:  Yeah.  Well, not only
 
us .  Everybody was  r eally s c ar ed.  They wer e fr ighte
ned 
bec aus e we c alled them the boche.  That's what the Germ ans  were,
 
the Ger man Army.  Not only the 
J ewis h people were fr ightened but ever ybody was frightened of the Ger mans .  They wanted to run out 
of Paris.  So s om e of them  went s outh to Vic hy and s ome of them went wes t to Ver s ailles .  I don't know 
who took  us  but in this  exodus  people were
 
--
 

8 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  what it's  k nown as , the exodus .  Right?  When thous ands  and thous ands wer e 
fleeing on bic ycles , c arts, anything to get away from  the advancing German Arm y. 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So there
 
you are par t of that.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .  So we ended up in Ver s ailles .  You know what's in Vers ailles ?  Ther e's a 

big palac e in Ver s ailles .  So when all of thes e people who wer e getting to Vers ailles , they didn't know 

what to do with us .  So the mayor  of the town s aid, well, we'r e going to put them up in the palac e.  And 
ther e's  this  one big r oom in the palac e.  Does anybody know what that big room is  c alled?  The big, big 
r oom. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I hear som ebody.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Som ebody knows
 
this ?  Ok .  I'll tell it to you.  It's called the Hall of Mir rors .  And 
the palac e
 
--
 
c ould you see this  room  her e?  Mak e it twic e as  long as this  auditor ium.  And then it had 
thes e chandelier s
 h
anging fr om all over , m irr ors on the walls .  So what they di
d is
 
--
 
they had to put us  
to s leep s omeplac e.  I don't know how we ate.  I jus t don't rem ember.  But they had to put us  to s leep 
s o they gave us  thes e bur lap s acks, you know, that you put potatoes in.  And in the back  they had this  
tr em endous  pile of hay.
  
So we put the hay into the potato s acks .  And then we tied it up.  And then we 
had a nic e little mattr ess .
  
So what we did
 
--
 
all over the s ides of that Hall of Mir rors  we put our beds, 
our  mattr esses , put them next to eac h other.  All of thes e people wer e s leeping.  I do r em ember that 

that s traw was  itc hing a lot.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And the bur lap, I would think.  So there's all of thes e refugees  filling the Hall of Mir rors .
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Then the Ger mans c om e.
 
>
>  SusanWar s inger:  Yeah.  They didn't s tay in Paris .  They c am e marching into Ver s ailles . We heard 
them with their  big boots.  They wer e m aking this  nois e. We c ould hear the trucks.  We c ould hear the 

tanks .  It was  r eally s c ary.  We c ould hear them mar
c hing into Vers ailles .
 
 
So any way, they got in front of the palac e.  They wanted to s peak  to the m ayor of our town
 
--
 
I 
don't know if he was  the mayor that they wanted
 
--
 
I don't know.  Som e big offic ial.  Then at the 
beginning of this  Caravan that the Naz
is  c am e, ther e was  this  c ar.  This  high
-
r anking Germ an officer 
got out of the c ar.  Now, he didn't know how to speak  any Fr enc h.  And the m ayor of the town didn't 

know how to s peak  any Germ an.  They wanted to talk to eac h other.  Som ebody s aid ther e's a li
ttle gir l 
in the palac e and s he knows  how to s peak  German.  So it was  me, you k now. 
  
So anyway, I'm s cared.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Terr ified.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly.  So they c all m e downs tairs.  It was  not in the gar den s ide.  It was  the 
fr ont s ide of the palac e.  So they s tar ted to ask  me different things.  So I trans lated for  them .  I don't 
r eally remember what they talked about.  But at the end they m ust have been s atisfied bec aus e the 
Nazi offic er, with high boots , bent down to me like this  and he said, "Little gir l, how c om e you know how 
to s peak  Germ an s o well?"  So I was  r eally s c ar ed by then.  So I told him
, y
ou know, the Fr enc h 
s c hools  are r eally very good and
 
I lear ned how to s peak Germ an.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ver y, ver y quick
-
Witted.  That was  pivotal you wer e able to s ay that. 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So after that you would m ake your way to another c omm unity.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .  After in Ver s ailles , Ver s ailles  was n't s afe becaus e the Nazis  took over all of 
nor thern Fr anc e but they left a little bit on the ins ide of Souther n Franc e to be independent of the Nazis .  
So a lot of people wanted to go down ther e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What we c all Vic hy Fr anc e today.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Exac tly.  Of c our s e, it was n't that independent bec aus e the pres ident at that tim e 

of that independent Vic hy, he was  really in c ahoots  with the Nazis .  But it was  better than being in the 
Nazi oc c upied.
 
 
So any way, we went to Vic hy.  And near Vic hy there was  this  little town called Brout
-
Ver net.  
An
d in that town there was  a c hateau, a c astle, an old c astle.  And in that old c as tle ther e wer e c hildr en 

9 
 
that wer e los t.  But thes e wer e all Jewis h c hildr en
 
that wer e lost and they didn't know where to go.  
They los t their parents.  They didn't know.  So they all c ongr egated into this  partic ular c hateau in 
Br out
-
Ver net.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ess entially an orphanage for J ewis h kids .
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ther e you ar e in this little c ommunity, in this  orphanage.  What was  that like?
 
> > Susan
 
War s inger:  Well, I tell you, they wer e v ery good to us.  We went to s c hool. We went to 
s c hool but
 
--
 
you know, thos e people in that village, a really s m all village, wouldn't let us  go to their 
public  s c hool either bec aus e they thought we would c ontaminate their c hildren s omehow.  It was  really 

s o s ad.  Bec aus e here wer e thes e little village kids  who wer e all far mer s.  We c ould have learned from 
them.  We wer e all of thes e c osm opolitan kids.  We c ould have taught them  s o m uc h.
 

 
But anyway, they gave us  a Fr enc h teac her.  And all of the kids  from  the chateau went to a 
public  s c hool but we were s egregated. We had a wonder ful Frenc h teac her  who taught us
 
--
 
I learned 
how to s peak Fr enc h really well.  I r eally knew how to write in Fr enc h.  We were happy.
 
 
Of 
c ours e, everybody, all the kids  in that c hateau, they all wanted to be r eunited with their  
par ents.  I dr eamed about being r eunited with m y parents  ever y night becaus e we hadn't hear d from  
them and we didn't know.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you had no idea where they wer e or if they wer e even alive at that point.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The war is  going on.  Circ ums tanc es  are diffic ult in gener al and there you ar e with ver y 
m eager r es our c es.  You told me about how you c elebr ated eac h other's  birthdays  as kids .  Can y
ou 
s har e that? 
 

> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  You have a good m emory.  Wow.  In that childr en's  hom e, kids  birthdays , 

we didn't have any money.  We c ouldn't buy them pr es ents .  We didn't have anything.  But what we did 
have, onc e or twic e a week  we got des sert.  Maybe it was  a little piec e of cake.  Maybe it was  a c ookie.  
Maybe it was  a piec e of c andy.  What we did is  we s aved it. We didn't eat it. We all had a locker  room 
in the attic of the c hateau.  So we s aved it.  If we had a friend that was  going to be a birthday c hild, s o 
all of the friends got together and we all s aved the c ake.  Then we put it in one of the lockers.  When it 

was  the day of the per s on's  birthday, one of them went to the kitc hen.  We had thes e tr ays  like you 
hav
e in the c afeter ia in sc hool.  And then s om ebody tried to find a doily.  Som ebody went out to s ee if 
they c ould find a flower .  All of the loot that we had c ollec ted fr om not eating the des s ert, we would put 

it on the tray.  And the pers on would wake up in
 
the m orning
 
--
 
ther e was n't any "Happy birthday."  It 
was  a differ ent song we s ang.  The pers on s aw the tray with all of thes e goodies  on it.  That's  how we 
c elebr ated.  I'm glad you rem em bered that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Finding mom ents of joy in thos e c irc um
stanc es.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sus an, here you are in a c hildr en's  hom e in Southern Franc e.  You don't know 
anything about the fate of your parents, their whereabouts .  Then one day you lear n that your parents  

ar e trying to get you out
 
and are trying to get to you.  How did your father  m anage to get you out, your  
par ents, under  thos e c ircum s tanc es ?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Ok .  So what had happened to my parents, m y par ents , they had a r elative her e 
in the Br onx who had a pic kle fac tory.  She was  my father's  c ous in.  She and her hus band and her 
c hildren had this  pickle fac tor y.  My father  got in touc h with her .  Again, the quota was  s till going on.  
You know about the quota I was telling you about.  But s he s ent him enough papers and s he s ai
d that 
he would not be a bur den to the United States, she would give him a job, he wouldn't have to be 
ec onomic ally dependent on anybody exc ept her.  So he got affidavits  to c om e to the United States.  
And m y brother and my m other  stayed in Germ any.  
 
 
And
 
while he got here, he wor ked and s omehow or other he got in touc h with the State 
Depar tment.  I have all of thes e letter s  now that I found on how he tried to get her out of Germ any and 
the baby. 
 
So anyway, they got her e.  So they got her e in 1940 while we were in that c hildr en's home in 
Fr ance.

> > Bill Bens on:  So the res t

your  m om, dad, and baby brother .

y c ame toWas hington is  bec aus e 
--
 
you 
know that rabbi I was  telling you about?  He als o es c a
ped out of Germany.  He cam e toWas hington.  
And m y father figur ed, well, if it was  good enough for  the rabbi, it was  c ertainly going to be good 
enough for him.  So that's  how we ended up in Was hington.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of c our se, for our audienc e, im portant to note that we were not in the war  yet.  That 
didn't happen until after Pearl Harbor day.  And Pearl Harbor in 1941.  So had that happened, they 
wouldn't have gotten out of Germany.  But they wer e able to m anage.
 
 
So here they ar e, you'r e in Southern Fr anc e. What happened then? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Well, m y father
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  For a while, he had no idea where you wer e.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  No.  There was  this  organization c alled the HIAS.  He, again
 
--
 
again, the State 
Depar tment,
 
c alled all o
f these organizations .  The Nazis  kept good rec ords .  We find r ec ords  now s till 
of what happened to all the J ewis h people bec aus e they kept r ec ords  of ever ything
 t
he Ger mans  did.  
Somehow or other  they found where we wer e.  He s ent us the tickets . We c am e
 
to the United States . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about that trip
, h
ow you left the c hateau, the s mall town, and made your  way to 
the United States .
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  We went to Mars eille, whic h is  the city on the way of the South of Franc e.  
Then
 
we went through Spain. We went over the Pyrenees , whic h are m ountains .  We went to Portugal
, 
i
nto Lis bon, whic h is  the c apital.  And ther e was  a boat, a Portugues e boat called the Ser pa Pinto.   We 
got on to this boat.  There wer e 50 kids  on this  boat.  And thes e 50 kids, they owe their  life, plus  m y 
br other and m e
,  
to Eleanor  Roosevelt.  I found this  out not too long ago.  I found it out in the rec or ds  
her e at the mus eum.  Eleanor  Roos evelt, s he worked ver y har d.  She had an organization to tr y and get 
c
hildren her e to the United States . 
 
 
So thes e 50 kids, we were in the hull of the s hip.  We were in the fr ont, way down on the 
bottom. We were not allowed to m ix.  It was  a cruis e s hip.  We wer e not allowed to m ix with the people 
on the boat.  So we were all on that s hip.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was  a Por tugues e s hip whic h is  s ignific ant bec aus e Portugal was  a neutral c ountr y.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Exac tly.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  why the s hip was  s afe for us  in that s ense.  Of c ours e, a few months later it 
wou
ld not have been poss ible.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  This  was  like Septem ber
 
1941.  Then, of c ours e, the war  s tarted her e in 
Dec ember.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you made it r eally with jus t a c ouple of m onths  to s pare.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So the ship pulls  into New York Harbor .  You're exc ited.  You'r e go
ing
 
to m eet 
your  
par ents.  Then you get way
laid
 
a little bit.  Tell us  what happened when you arr ived.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I told you about m y brother J oe. Well, he was n't going to s tay in that hull of the 
boat where we wer e told not to go.  But he went and inves tigated that whole s hip.  He found a plac e 
wher e they had pineapple, fres h pineapples .  He and I had never eaten pineapples  befor e.  They wer e 
s ending pineapples  to the United States. 
 
I don't know wher e they got them  but they brought them to 
the United States .  He kept eating pineapples , pineapple, pineapple, m or ning, noon and night.  You 

know, he was  very excited.  I don't want to tell you about this but he's not her e s o don't tell hi
m.  He 
us ed to wet the bed.  You know, we were in bunk  beds  in that hull.  He used to s leep on top of m e.  So I 

m ade him c hange.  I was  on the bottom  and he was  on the top.  
 
 
Any way, he was  eating all the pineapple.  He was  urinating in the bed.  And you 
know, 
pineapple is  very ac idic .  He got this  r as h all over his  body.  By the tim e we c am e to the por t in New 

York, you know, all the people got off the boat.  They had a doctor c ome into the hull of the boat to 
c heck all the 50 kids
t
o make s ur e they didn'
t have any c omm unic able dis eas es .  So ever ybody was  
fine exc ept m y br other.  They looked at his ras h on his  body.  On top of it he had a fever.  He s aid he 

11
 
 
had a fever.  He tells  ever ybody he had a fever.  He does n't talk  about the r as h.  But I r emember he
 
had the ras h.  They s aid you c an't c om e into the United States .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You stayed on the ship for  a while? What happened?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Give a guess . Wher e do you think they took  us ?
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Ellis  Is land?
 
> > Susan Wars inger:  
Yes .  Absolutely r ight.  Bec aus e in thos e days  Ellis  Is land was  the plac e wher e 
you took  people that they wouldn't let in.  So we went to Ellis  Is land.  There they gave him medic ine 

and whatever.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Meanwhile, your par ents
 
--
 
> > Susan Wars ing
er:  My father
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Still haven't s een you.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  We s aw him  standing on the pier and we were on the boat.  We waved. We 

c ouldn't get to him . 
 
 
So any way, I just wanted to tell you about Ellis  Is land a little bit.  Is that ok
? 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sur e. 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  So we lear ned all about the United States in Ellis  Island.  So we were s itting in 

this  dining r oom.  The table was  long.  All of these different people that c ouldn't c om e into the United 
States, you know, all kinds .  We were all s itting, eating together.  And on the tables  they had bread 

piled up like this  high.  Ther e wer e thes e white s lic es .  We had never s een white br ead befor e bec aus e, 
you know, in Germ any or Fr anc e they never was ted anything.  So her e was  this white bread. We took  
the white bread.  We c ould just cr us h it in our hand.  We c ould make little balls  on it.  They told us  it 
was  c alled Wonder  Br ead.  We were s o exc ited.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Then m y brother was  s itting next to this s ailor.  He was  dr inking this  brown drink .  

It was  bubbly.  It tickled your  nos e.  My brother
 
--
 
he s aid to m y br other, "Why don't you take a taste?"  
My brother looked at me bec aus e I was  his  bigger sis ter , ﬁShould I tas te it?ﬂ  I s aid go ahead and tr y it
.  
He s aid, 
ﬁO
h, it's ver y good.
ﬂ
  
It tur ned out it was  Coc a
-
Cola.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Any way.  And then we als o found out that the kids here in the United States, they 

c ould have c andy and you c ould keep it in your mouth for a whole day. 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  So we lear ned about c hewing gum. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about the r eunion with your parents. 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Well, you know, m y brother healed.  He healed.  Then we went bac k  to the pier.  
They took  us back  in the boat.  My father took  us to Was hington wher e m y br other  and the baby wer e.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Do 
you 
rem em ber  m uc h about what that was  like?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I don't like talking about it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .  Ok.  It was a har d time for your par ents
.  Wasn't it?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of c our se, one of the things that you had to do was  r es um e educ ation.  Tell us about 
that.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Ok .  They put m e in the s eventh grade.  At that time, they didn't have, you k now, 

like
 
you go to sc hool and you have
 
--
 
s om e kids  ar e sm art at r eading, s ome kids  are not s o sm art.  You 
have them all together.  But what they had at that tim e, they had homogeneous  gr ouping.  And what 

they did is  they took all the kids  that were really s m art and put them in one c las s .  And then they put all 

of the kids that didn't know how to r ead, that didn't know how to behave, and that didn't do their 
hom ework , all of them in one c las s .  And then ever ybody in between in differ ent c las s es .  So 7B the 
s m art ones , 7B1 wer e the dum b ones .  Guess  where they put me.  7B1, yup. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  7B1.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  I c ouldn't believe what was  going on in that c
las s r oom.  And the r eason 
they put me in 7B1 is  bec aus e I didn't know how to s peak any Englis h.  So I was  r eally feeling badly for  

12
 
 
the teac her.  I c ouldn't believe that the kids  in the United States didn't do their  homework.  Bec ause, 
you know, in Fr anc e and in Germany, the teac her is  the mos t im portant thing in your  life bes ides your  
par ents.
 
>> B
ill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  But thes e kids, they didn't do their hom ework.  And a c ouple of the fellows  would 
s leep while s he was  teaching them s om ething.  I jus t c ouldn't believe that.
  
Any way, we don't do that 
anym or e.  We m ix ever ybody together. 
  
So anyway, after  a few m onths I was in 7B3 but I never  did get 
to 7
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You never  m ade it.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  No.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I was  struc k  when you told me
 
--
 
when we firs t m et you told me you wer e just stunned 
at how bad Americ an boys  c ould behave. 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I rem ember  you telling me that. 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  But I m ean, they were not

they were just

not all boy
s , you know, jus t 
ther e. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  7B1.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  That's  what I s aw.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was  quite an adjustm ent for you to make when you came her e.  When your  par ents  

fir s t arr ived, how did they ear n their living?  What did they 
do to s or t of get es tablis hed? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I think what m y father did when he fir s t c am e her e to make money, he us ed to go 
to the
 
--
 
he r em ember ed the strawberr ies  and the berr ies .  He us ed to go to the far mer .  And he went 
and got eggs  from farm
ers .  And at that par tic ular tim e you had to go c heck  the eggs to make s ur e that 
ther e was n't any blood in them .  So he bought all of thes e
 
--
 
I r emem ber he bought c as es and c as es  of 
eggs.  He took them  hom e.  And in the bas ement he took  a little box and he put the egg ins ide the box 
to look that ther e was no blood in it.  And then we helped him put the eggs in like a 12
-
egg car ton.  
Then he went out and he s old them to the J ewis h people in Was hington bec aus e they all wanted to 

s upport him and help him  out.
  
So that's how he s tarted out.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Selling eggs to folks. 
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: What about the r es t of your fam ily in Germany?  What do you know about what 
happened to your fam ily? 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Well, ever ybody
 
on m y mother's s ide ended up 
i
n the c onc entr ation c amps .  
Nobody s urvived.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Nobody s urvived.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Ever ybody on m y father 's  s ide
 
--
 
bec aus e I told you he was  fr om Poland.  You 
pr obably will learn it when you go upstair s  and if you go to s ee the exhibit "Som eWer e Neighbors ," 
you're going to lear n that, you know, when the Nazis  went into Poland, they didn't even bother s ending 

them to the c onc entr ation c am ps . What they did is
 
they went into all of thos e sm all towns  and they 
m
ade all of thos e people go into the woods  and dig gr aves  and then they threw them in the gr aves  and 
s hot them all.  So all of m y father 's  family
 
--
 
there's  no r ecor d of them.  They're gone.  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you los t vir tually ever ybody in the ex
tended fam ily.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the Nazis  didn't s uc c eed.  
Can 
I brag now?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You may br ag now.  You have tim e to brag.  Abs olutely.
 
> > Sandr a Ger m an:  I'll brag.  I have three kids.  I have thr ee daughters .  They'r e all
 
--
 
m y one daughter 
is  a car diologis t, the other is  a danc er , the other  one runs her hus band's  bus ines s es  and s he's a 
dietitian.  They all have c hildr en.  My gr andc hildr en, one of them  just gr aduated with a Ph.D. from M.I.T.  
Another  one is  a doctor.  And ever ybody is  really, r eally doing wonderful things  for the United States .  
And they'r e doing r es earc h.  They'r e big hum an beings  who help the United States .  And I'm s o very 
pr oud of them.  And my br other's kids the same thing.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J os eph?
 

13
 
 
>> 
SusanWars inger:  Yes .  Als o, the baby
 
--
 
J oseph is  a c ar diologist.  And that baby
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bad little J os eph becam e a c ardiologis t
, a
 
r ather fam ous one as  I understand. 
 
> > Susan War
s inger:  Yeah.  And my br other 
Ernest, the baby, he wor ked for
 
NA SA .  He's  a phys ic is t.  
He's  retir ed now but he still goes to m eetings  becaus e he knows  all about the ozone in the air and he 
m akes meetings with people all over  the world to s ee what we c an do about the ozone in the air. 
 
So Hitler  didn't s uc c eed what he s et out to do even though he killed ever ybody in m y family. We 
s ur vived. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sus an, we have a c ouple of m inutes  to have a few ques tions  from our audienc e.  Is  

that ok?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we c lose the 
program.
 
 
So we have a c hanc e for you to ask Sus an a c ouple of questions .  I would ask that you wait 
until you get a m icrophone when you have a ques tion.  I hope that s om ebody will.  Wait until you have 
a mic r ophone that way ever ybody inc luding Sus an will 
hear  the question.  And 
I  
m ay r epeat the 
question to make s ure everybody hear s  it.  Try to m ake it as  brief as  you can.  That way we c an get a 

c ouple of ques tions in.
 
 
We have micr ophones  on either s ide of the ais le.  I think ther e's a hand up here.  And we have 
a mic r ophone.  Yes ? 
 
>> 
When you were looking for  a c ountr y to go to, why didn't you go
 
--
 
or c ould you go to Isr ael? 
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you were looking for a c ountr y to go to, the family, why not go to Israel?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  That's a ver
y good question.  You know, at that tim e, Isr ael
 
--
 
ther e was  no 
Is r ael.  It was  Pales tine.  And it was , you know, what c ountr y Is r ael
 
--
 
Pales tine belonged to at that tim e 
was  England.  They had a quota just like everybody els e.  It was  ver y hard to go to
 
Pales tine.  You 
c ouldn't just go to Pales tine.  A lot of J ewis h people wanted to go ther e to start a new s tate.  But not 
ever ybody wanted to go there.  Not ever ybody c ould go under the Englis h quota. 
 
And then, bes ides , 
m y mother and father had hear d s uc h
 
wonderful things  about the United States, how wonderful the 
United States  was  and how democ ratic the United States  was .  That's all we talked about.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.  Do we have another?  Ther e we go. 
 
>> 
I wonder how long you wer e in the c hateau in Souther n Fr anc e.
 
> > SusanWar s inger:  Yes , I was  ther e fr om 1940 to 1941.  At that tim e Hitler hadn't figured out the final 
s olution yet.  People were going to c onc entration camps but they were not this  plan of gas s ing and 
doing away with all of the J ews  in it Europe.  It was  not known at that tim e yet.  But we knew that things  
were bad for the J ewis h people.  So I was  very luc ky to get her e.  He's  talking about one of the reas ons  

that I didn't
 
--
 
I was  lucky bec aus e the war  with the United States hadn't s tar ted.  I was  luc ky bec aus e 
people r eally wer en't mas s  s ent to c onc entration c amps at that tim e. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.  We have one right over  here in the end. 
 
>> 
What was  the r eligious life like for you back in Germ any, es pecially, you know,
 
being a J ew?  What 
was  it like?  What wer e some of the strong points?  How did that help
, i
f anything, about what was  
happening to your people at the tim e?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I'm  glad you asked that. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  A question about Sus an's r eligious  life and how did that help. 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  My father  was  ver y  Or thodox.  He was  a very Or thodox J ewis h m an.  We 

kept all of the tr aditions.  When we went to Fr anc e in that childr en's  home, in the c hateau, the childr en's  
hom e kept k os her and w
e kept all the traditions .  Even though in Fr anc e, you know, the kids  in Fr anc e 
don't go to sc hool the way you guys  go.  You have the weekend off
, 
Saturday, and Sunday.  In Fr anc e 
the kids get off on Sunday and Thurs day.  So the Jewis h kids  had to go to s c
hool on Satur day, which 
is
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Sabbath.
 
> > SusanWars inger:  Yeah.  So we went but the teac her  was  r eally good.  You're not s uppos ed to 
wr ite, drive, all Orthodox r ules .  So they wer e r eally good.  The teac her, we read and we talked.  S
o he 
unders tood our plight bec aus e we wer e r eligious .
 

14
 
 
 
As  far  as believing in God
 
--
 
I think  that's  pr obably what you wer e asking me.  Probably saying 
to me how c an she still believe in God when s he s aw all of thes e things happening to the J ewis h 
people. Well, my feeling is  this.  It was n't God who was  r es pons ible for  the Holoc aus t.  God gave man 
a choic e to do what he wants  to do.  It was  the Nazis  who did it.  It was n't God. 
 
 
As  far  as my religion is  now, in the United States , it's  muc h eas ier not to be
 
Or thodox.  Gues s 
what?  I'm not Or thodox anymore but I still believ e in the J ewis h r eligion.  So I'm proud to be J ewis h. 
 
 
Does  that ans wer your ques tion? 
 
>> 
Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.  Thank you.
 
 
We have tim e for one more.  Right here in the m idd
le.
 
>> 
What languages  ar e you fluent in? 
 
> > Bill Bens on: What languages ar e you fluent in?
 
> > SusanWars inger:  In Englis h, maybe.  When I was  in 
Germany, I was  9.  I left Germ any when I was  
9.  That's  like m y m other tongue.  I s peak  still and read still
 
on a 9
-
year
-
old's  level.  I find that fine.  But 
the m inute you start talking and start reading Germ an writers who ar e very intellec tual and liter ate, it's 
very hard for me to
 
under s tand those wor ds  bec aus e I never got a c hanc e to us e them .
  
So m y German 
is  ok. When people s peak  s lowly, I'm fine.  I went back  to Germany.  I was  fine if people wer e s peaking 

s lowly.
 
 
And m y Fr enc h
 
--
 
the thing, the m ost im por tant thing I wanted to tell you, you know, like 
Germ any is  not my c ountry.  I'm an Am er ic an.  
I rea
l
ly never liked
 
Germ an people for a long, long tim e.  
It was n't their  fault but.  And I didn't like hearing it.  I didn't like hear ing German.  So I kept away from it 
for a long, long tim e.  But now, you know, the Germans  s aid, look , we'r e sor ry for what ou
r 
grandpar ents  did.  They do ever ything, all of the young people.  They put up monum ents .  They'r e sor ry 
for what their gr andpar ents  did.  They ar e s hock ed at what their gr andparents  did
.
  
So I c an't be ups et 
with the Ger m an people anymore.  I'm  not.  I'm  jus t ups et with what their grandparents  did.
 
 
And the Frenc h was  the s ame thing.  It gave m e two years  
--
 
I us ed to s peak  r eally well.  Gave 
m e two year s  of being away, s eparated fr om m y par ents and it brings back  bad m emories .  But I can 

s till s peak  it bu
t from a child's  level.  But I don't lik e doing it.  I'd r ather s peak  in English. 
 
 
I'm ver y patriotic .  You can ask me anything patriotic .  I'm  all for  the United States . 
 
> > Bill Bens on: We ar e about to c los e our program.  I'm  going to turn back  to Sus an in just a moment 

to c los e our pr ogram becaus e it's  our  tr adition at
 
Firs t Pers on
 
that our
 
First Pers on
 
gets  the last word.  I 
want to jus t remind you that we will end our s eason tomorrow with our program tom orrow. We will 

r es ume again in the s pr ing 
of 2016.  So we hope if your travels  bring you bac k  to Washington, D.C. or if 
you live s om ewher e in the ar ea that you'll c om e bac k  to a
 
Fir s t Per s on
 
pr ogram next year.
 
 
When Sus an's  done with her final wor d, s he's going to leave the stage.  I'd like her to
 
m ake 
her  way up the ais le on the r ight s o that s he c an get out and s ign c opies of "Ec hoes  of Memor y" that 
s he c ontr ibutes to.  That will be an opportunity for you, too, to ask  her a ques tion that you m ay not have 
been able to do s o.
 
 
When 
Sus a
n's  finis hed
, our  photographer , J oel, who has  been taking pic tures  as you notic ed
,  
is  going to com e up on stage and take a photogr aph of Sus an with you as  the backdrop.  So I'm going 

to ask  you to s tand at that point bec aus e it makes  jus t a r eally nic e photograph for 
Sus an to have when 
we'r e done with the program.
 
 
On that note, I turn it over  to Sus an. 
 
> > SusanWars inger:  I k new you wer e going to as k  me that s o I wrote it on my c omputer and printed it 
out.  It's  just one page. 
 
 
I want my childr en, m y grandc hildren,
 
m y br others and their  families , my fr iends , and the 
vis itors  her e in the audience to rejoic e in the fact that we are living in a democ ratic  s oc iety and that all 

of us s hould m ake s ure that no dic tators hip would ever us ur p our liber ties.  We need to r em emb
er the 
atroc ity that happened to fam ilies  dur ing the Holoc aus t and pas s this inform ation on to our pr ogeny.  
We need to learn fr om this  hor ror  in our his tor y.  We c annot undo the atroc ities  of the past.  Bes ides  

r em em bering, we have to take action to c onfront hate. When we s ee injus tic e taking plac e, we have to 

15
 
 
do s om ething about it.  We c annot be onlooker s.  We have to be s ens itive to eac h other.  We have to 
take c are of eac h other. 
 
 
Why I do volunteer  in this  m us eum?  People ask m e:  How c an you do this
 
over  and over?  
How c an I not?  Giving tour s  to our  vis itor s thr ough our Perm anent Exhibition hopefully teac hes them  
what hatr ed and pr ejudice c an do to people.  And when tour ing law enforc ement offic er s and futur e FBI 
agents , I hope that they under s tand their r ole when enc ounter ing atroc ities .
 
 
We c annot be bys tanders  and definitely not be c ollabor ators.  There are thr eats of genoc ide in 
m any parts  of the world at the pres ent tim e. We c annot be indiffer ent to emerging threats of genocide 

and m ass  atroc ities.  All of us need to be awar e of what is  happening and we need to work  together  
and take the nec es s ar y ac tions  to prevent people from being murdered for  the s imple reas on that they 
ar e different.
  
Never  again do we want to s tand by and do nothing.
 
 
I wa

c om ing to our  m us eum  and being witnes s es  to this  s tor y of the Holoc aus t and for  lis tening to my s tor y. 
 
 
Now, when you go to the Perm anent Exhibition, make s ure

m y s tory is  all on the fourth floor.  
And m any of the exhibits  ther e dis c us s exac tly what I was  talking about.  So look  at the exhibit c alled
