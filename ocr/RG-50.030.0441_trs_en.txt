Q:  Whe n di d you, di d you ret ur n t o Czernowitz?  
A:  I ret urned to Czerno
witz  at t he e nd of June 
1940 when the Russians o
ccupied Cze r nowitz , fir st 
in order to be with my
 fa mil y, and s econdl y bec ause  at t hat
 time an anti-Semiti
c governme nt was  
install ed in Bucharest .  

Q:  Can you go back fo
r one moment t o t he inter-war peri od 
and tel l us i f yo
u wi tnessed any, 
witnessed any instances of 
anti-Semitism 
in Roma nia? 
A:  Before I came in contact wi
t h the Roma ni ans , I didn™ t know an
ything about anti-Semitism.  Say 
around the a ge of ten or 12, the r e 
wa s a Co ngress of, Congress of Ro
mani an st udents i n Czer nowit z  
and t hey we nt around town and sang their, t heir c h
ant s about l ong li ve Roma nia , de ath to the Je ws .  
They took off the, there wa s a municipal theater, 
they took off the sign 
__________ wh
ich wa s now 
onl y for Roma nia n pla c e .  One year 
later or t w o years l ater , t here 
wa s after the edu
cat ion was taken 
over  by the Roma ni an gove
r n me nt a nd t he stude nts didn™t know
 enough Roma ni an
, most of t he m  
fai led at t he matr icul ation exam 
called baccalaur eate and 
some, one pr otested ve
r y heavily.  It was 
shot down by a Roma nia n stude nt.  The st ude nt, a fte r a trial was ac qu
itted.  This way, I got to learn 

about Romanian 
anti-Semitism. 
Q:  Let™ s go bac k to the s u mmer of 1940 when t h e 
Soviets , soldier troops occ upie d Bukovina .  G o  

ahead, yeah. 

A:  I  would l ike t o continue. 

Q:  Yeah, please go ahead. 

A:  Then when I was a student at
 the Pol ytechni c in Buchar est, th
ere were a number
 of st udents  
were anti-Semitic but the engineer
ing at mosphere  prevaile d a n d were
, we  wer e  tre a ted  mo re or l e ss 
equally.  But at the end of our 
studies, we didn™t ha
ve the same opportun
ities like the Romania n  
graduate s.  The  Roma ni an gr adua
te s  had open fi elds , we c ould ta
ke only second-hand positions . 
This was still mu ch better than for 
ot her professi ons.  Fr om the prob
abl y ear ly thirti es, no Jew coul d 
get a job as a teacher in public sc
hool s, onl y in private sc
hools.  And no 
Jew was ever ad
mitt ed to be  
a civil service employee.  Same thing in the Army. 
 1936, whe n I wa s in the 
Ar my , in just an eight 
months course fo r e
ngineers, the, none
 of the Jews were
, was admitted to th
e exam to become

A:  Okay, s o, June 22

oxi mat ely.  I was te mpte d 
to go as well.  Quite a 
number of my friends we nt

ssian l eader s.  Say, the, when we  
stayed at the office in the last da y, they ga ve aut
horizations to, authorizati
ons of evacuations to all 
the Russi ans who came from 
t he Sovi et Uni on but  woul dn™t  gi ve a n

myself just with some fr

nd t hey wouldn™t eve n l et us in.  We  were a fr aid  
of t he Ge r m ans comi ng here , here  as
, as occupier s but plus, at  that  
ti me , I  wa s alr eady in l ove  with 
Lott e.  She s aid, s he s aid, ﬁI never would lea ve my 
fa mil y, eit h er.ﬂ  And so 
we st aye d an d wai t ed for  
a fe w more  days  whe n t he  Roma nia ns and with

Q:  What ha ppe ne d whe n 
the Romanians and t he Ger mans ent ere

I reme mber exactl y the day, when 
for the first ti me we

ﬁThat™s  ve ry good that

Q:  What  ha ppe ne d next ? 

A:  Okay, next, it wa s ve

at thi s ti me  t here was no, not , not  enough food. 
There was many other, there wa

 Fe w da ys l ater, a young stude nt , mi l i t ary st ude nt, 
we had at that time I think this 
was a still high school

talked this over with the,
 his chi e f which was the

gh at that time I got paid only  
the pay of a soldier and from then 
on and t hrough this e mployme nt,

I said, in t he beginning, we had pr obl

Bukovina, l i ke in all of Ro
ma ni a, food wa s pl ent y an
d t hen we got  to ba rter
 di ffere nt  things fr om

enough.  Now, this is only say  
one  mor e mont h beca use  in October  a t

those who will help fl ee people away.ﬂ
  So I said to her, 
ﬁI don™t understand.  Th

us.  We  don™ t want  to flee
 and we  don™ t want  to gi ve s helter ,ﬂ 
and I read t o her. 
 One  o™ cl ock I c a me

we didn™t ever to go.  So I went
 across the str eet t o Lotte and she 
sa id, ﬁ We go to a cousin of mi ne 
who is in the street, in a street which belongs to th

th
, we were t ol d that th ese

  So we put all our

we waited on the street  
to go to the railway station to the trains, bringi

there, the people started 
talking that some number
 will stay, will not go.  
And said, one lady said, 
ﬁYou know, engi nee r s s hould st ay.ﬂ
  So a Romania n maj or pass ed
 by a nd I said, ﬁ Mr. M ajor , I

took it out of the streets leading to

of the ghetto we were supposed to

supposed, we were not s uppos ed to go, go there a nd

A:  For al most, oka y, s o next da y thi s  good ne ws from Parryom Po
