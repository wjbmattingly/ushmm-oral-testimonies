Question:  This is a United States Holocau
st Memorial Museum interview with Bertl 
EsenstatEsenstad on September 16th, 2010, in
 Silver Spring Maryland, and we 'd  like to 
thank you very much fo
r agreeing to see us, to talk with
 us, and I'll start our interview 
like we always do at the beginning with--
 
Answer:  That's a good place to start. 
 
Q: With asking you wh en you were born, 
where were you born, 
how many siblings you 
had, and who were you parents?
 (clock chiming) And by the clock chiming, we know it's 
10:00 A.M. 
 
A: So what would you 
like to know?  I was born October 28th, 1925. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: In a very small shtetl in Germany called 
Korb, KORB. In fact, I was born in the same 
bed my  father was born in, in the same house. 
 
Q: Wow. 
 
A: And my grandparents had lived  there. It 
was a small place in 
a small--there might 
have beenI don't know how 
many Jews, not too many. And my  father was Adolf 
Rosenfeld and he married my  mo ther Katherin
e Limburger I think in the year before. I 
don't know. I don't know the date of their marr
iage, and we lived there are for a year. And 
after my grandmother died--I really didn't 
know myone grandfather, I knew. He was my 
mother's father, but the others I never knew. 
They  moved to--not too far away to another 
little bigger place called Adelsheim. 
 
 
Q: Adelsheim
 
A: Adelsheim inand there were e
nough Jews to make a Minyan. 
 
Q: What part of Germany was this in? 
 
A: That was in Baden. 
 
Q: In Baden? 
 
A: Which is near Württemberg. It
's near Heilbronn, near Mannheim. 
 
Q: So it would be like westernmiddle part
 of Germany. Not quite to the south? 
 

A: That's right. That's right. My
 father had lost a leg in the first world war; so he had a 
wooden leg, and he was what they call 
a--I don't know wh at you say in English. 
 
Q: Say it in German and we'l l tran slate. 
 
A: (?Efeihen Lurhur?)  
 
Q: He sold cattle? 
 
A: He sold cattle, and he sold fe
ed to the farmer
s in the area. 
 
Q: He sold feet?  
 
A: FEED. 
 
Q: Oh feed. 
 
A: Feed. 
 
Q: Feed. Okay he sold--
 
A: Whatever. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: Whatever. What else?  What else?  
 
Q: Well, I sounds like in what--y
ou're saying is that he was born in  a place where at least 
his family had been for an generation? 
 
A: Or two, yeah. 
 
Q: Do you know how your family--
 
A: I have no idea.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I have no idea how th
ey got there. But ther
e were like 13 children. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: In those--I think my mother's family also had about 11 or 12. 
 
Q: Now, her name is unusual in my --when I hear it--
 
A: Limburger? 
 
Q: No, Katherine, because Ka
therine is a Catholic name. 
 
A: You know, I never--she never was called 
that. She was called Katty or Kater, and I 
assume--th at's how I knew it,
 and I knew her as Mutter. 
 

Q: Yeah, of course. 
 
A: So it was Kater or Katty. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: And she came from a place called Rexingen
. My husband and I ha
ve been back to 
both places. Rexingen had the larg
est percentage of Jews of 
any place, and 40 percent of 
the population of Rexingen was Jewish. 
 
Q: Wow. 
 
A: And a lot of them were called Limburger, a
nd I always thought they were all related. 
They were not all related. They came
 from a place in Poland called Limburg. 
 
Q: And Limburg I believe is the 
German name for (? Livoff?)  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Yeah. I'm not sure, but I believe that th
ey called (?Livoff?) Li
mburg, or could be 
many places or some other small--
 
A: But they were not all related. 
 
Q: How interesting. How in tere
sting. So your mo ther's fa
mily actually 
eventuallyway 
back, could have come from Poland?  To Rexingen? 
 
A: You know, I was--I was 12 when I lef
t; and you know, bringing up children in 
Germany was quite different from these days
. You didn't tell them your history. You 
were just there, and you just did th ings. 
 
Q: Were you the oldest?  The youngest?  
 
A: Yeah. I was the oldest of five. 
 
Q: You were the oldest of 
five. Who was born after you? 
 
A: My sister, Edith. 
 
Q: Remember there's a mike. Okay. There'
s a mike on you. Ther
e's a mike on you. 
 
A: She was--that 's my sister,  Edith. 
 
Q: Okay . And in  a second she's going to put
--put the machine on you again. (Unrelated 
conversation) So this is a picture of Edith taken in what year?  
 
A: I don't know wh en th at was taken. Edith died
 in '98, and after her, Ruth was born. And 
then Herman was born 
in--she was born in '30; Herman wa s born in  '33, but I don't have a 
picture of him right away. And then  Esther. 
Where's Easter?  She should be on here. See 

this man?  Somehow or other I think it deva
stated the German eco
nomy when all these 
Jews left. And they 'r e now doing a history. I'm 
sure you're aware of that. There used to be 
a man--I had to write to Germany for birth ce
rtificate or something to this little place 
called Korb. 
 
Q: So th e place your were born in? 
 
A: Where I was born. And there was a man th
ere who knew my father by the name of 
(?Weterhour?) who's doing a history of the Jews
 that lived in that 
area. The problem was 
(?Weterhour?)--my German is gone. It's gone. An
d he couldn't  talk English; so all the 
letters were in German which I 
had to have translated, and I th
ink in '90, my  son--where's 
my son--here. Had to go the France, and 
he says, "You know, Mo m, I'd like to go to  
Adelsheim because that
's where we lived," and I wrote to (?Weterhour?) And low and 
behold, I got a letter b ack in English. (?We
terhour?) was getting too old to take care of 
___. 
 
Q: So that's  the last name of the man? 
 
A: That's the last name of 
the man. This man was taken a
nd his English is wonderful. So 
Allen went to Germany and met hi
m, and he persuaded us go to. 
 
Q: To visit? 
 
A: There's another little village called Senn
feld, which is near 
Adelsheim where the 
synagogue was still standing. 
And he--they opened it as a 
museum. I think upstairs are 
oldfashioned farm utensils, and down stairs
 is all Jewish. So
 we'v e been there.
 
(Background noise)
 
Q: But mostly we don't--
 
A: Well, out of five, this waswe really very 
close. These are my nieces. I got eight nieces, 
one nephew , and one son. So  there are ten cousin s.
 
Q: So you were four
 girls and one boy? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you were the oldest?  
 
A: I was the oldest. I'm still is oldest. 
 
Q: What was you language growing up in--i
n home. Was it Yiddish, or was it German? 
 
A: It was German. I didn't--I don 't--I can 't speak Yiddish.
 
Q: Were there any other languages they were
 spoken at home?  Did you feel yourself 
German, more German than Jewish, 
or equally German as Jewish?  
 

A: I never gave it a thought. I knew 
I was German, and I knew I was Jewish. 
 
Q: And it was normal? 
 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
 
Q: Can you let me a little bit about what life 
was like. It wasn't Ad
elsheim that you have 
the most memories. W h at ar
e your earliest memories? 
 
A: Because I was a year old when th
ey moved from Korb to Adelsheim. 
 
Q: Do you have some earliest
 me mo ries you could share?  
 
A: My father was very strict. I think he wa
s boss, and there were--because of his one leg-
-we lived on a hill. We were never allowed 
to go bicycle riding. We
 were never allowed 
to go to snow--sledding because he as afraid that if we needed
 help, he couldn't--
 
Q: He couldn't be there to do it? 
 
A: He couldn't be there to do it. Bu t we did. We did. 
 
Q: How can you keep kids 
from doing stuff like that? 
 
A: I know. And when we were 
out playing, and he wanted 
us to come home, he would 
stand in the front of the steps of our 
house and whistle. Ever
ybody in that little 
Adelsheim knew that whistle so. 
 
Q: That was Mr. Rosenfeld's whistle? 
 
A: I don't know what else. I thi
nk we had very  normal childhood. 
 
Q: What was your mo th er like?  Was she somebody who stayed at home and took care of 
the house, or did she work ? 
 
A: Well, not really because when the weat
her was bad, she had 
to go with him to do 
whatever earned him a living be
cause of his--he couldn't walk
 on ice. He couldn't walk 
on sn ow. So... 
 
Q: So sh e was part of his busin ess?  
 
A: I guess so, yeah. I guess so. 
 
Q: And how did he lose his leg? 
 
A: In the war. 
 
Q: But as a soldier? 
 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 
 

Q: He was in the front? 
 
A: Yeah. And, you know, wh en
 you're growing up, you acce
pt things and 
you don't look 
at ages and somebody who's mayb
e fourfoot tall if you're that big, their tall. But he was 
only a teenager. When I think back of wh en  he
 lost his leg, he was only a teenager when  
he lost his leg. 
 
Q: And so he was also ve
ry young when he became 
a father because that was
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In the 20s. Did he talk
 about World War I 
with the kids?  Did he tell stories? 
 
A: No. I just remember him 
saying, when he came home from the war, he went on a 
mo torcycle, and he had a bad ex perience. I 
don't know what happened, but I rememb er he 
said, "Don't  ever go on a mo torcycle." 
 
Q: So he was fearful for his kids?  
 
A: Yeah, yeah. Friday nights he would inspect
 our hair for lice, our nails, our toenails. I 
think German men--I don't know ab out only 
Jewish men. I don 't know anything about 
any other men--were very bossy
. Very, you know, weren't they
?  So that I remember, and 
I reme mb er when  he came homebefore he went to the war, he had apprentice as a baker. 

Well, when he came home and didn't have a leg,
 he couldn't continue baking, but he used  
to make (?Holis?) And he used to make to
rtes. He used to cook. He used to bake. 
 
Q: Well, that's also unusual for a man in--in 
a place where there was very distinct roles 
that were assigned to who does what. 
 
A: I guess, yeah. I sup
pose. You know, when  you
 
Q: You don't think of things 
like that when  you're a kid? 
 
A: Not really. Not really. 
 
Q: What was your mom like?  
 
A: She was a doll. You know, but it's over 70 
years. It's h ard. At 
this point you don't 
know what you imagine or what
 was real. It's very hard. 
 
Q: Does that mean you don't have me mo ries of her?  
 
A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah . 
 
Q: And so do you--can  you say that there 
are some memo ries you know are real or 
distinct?  
 

A: Oh yeah. I remember. I re
member cleaning for (?pay self?) on the ceiling to theto the 
attic to the basement. And, 
you know, when you have five
 kids, you're very busy. 
 
Q: Were you kind of in charge of some
 of the other kids, being the oldest? 
 
A: I remember diapering Esther, and I rememb
er after three girls wh
en Herman was born, 
when  he woke us up when  he was born, th
at was a big thing. That was a big thing. 
 
Q: What kind of education le
vel did your parents have?  
 
A: I don't remember. I don't really know. I don't really know. 
 
Q: Did you father attend Gimn ázium or--
 
A: I don't think so. He was in the army as a 
teenager, and then he appren ticed--honestly I 
don't know. 
 
Q: So--
 
A: Neither one of them was a professional. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: I don't know how many prof
essionals there were in those days in little rural--
 
Q: Communities? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you have any--in Ad elsheim, you say 
there was enough Jews to make a Minyan? 
 
A: Yeah, we had a Shul. 
 
Q: You had a Shul. Is that wher
e you went to school as well? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: Grade school. 
 
Q: And--
 
A: And we were expected to
 get A's, and I do reme mb er later on wh en our grad es got 
bad, he was very upset, and the grad
es got bad because of Hitler. You know. 
 
Q: Tell me in what way?  In what way did th
is affect you?  In wh
at way, you know, you 
were children. You were--in 1933, when  he 
came to power, how old were you, eight? 
 
A: Yeah. And how many 8yearold
s rememb er what happened, 
especially if it was a bad 
thing that happened, you know?  
 

Q: But it was a Jewish school that you went to? 
 
A: No. No. No. 
 
Q: No. It was an overall. I see. I see. 
 
A: It was a--nowe had to be sent away. We went to--and I don't remember the year, but 
there was a Jewish school in Heilbronn. 
And we had an  aunt--excuse me. My--my  
mother's family, the si
sters, there were only two ___. Th
ey were very close, and there 
was a Jewish school in Heilbronn. I don't kno
w whatwhen  we weren't allowed to go to 
the school anymore in Adelsheim. 
 
Q: So it was an overall public school fo r everybody. 
 
A: Oh yeah. It was a grade school for ev
erybody. There was a Jewish school in 
Heilbronn, which--where we ha
d an aunt. So me Esther--me
, Edith, and Esther, and Ruth 
were sent to Heilbro nn to go to th e Jewish
 school. And we were there for a while. I don't 
know how long we were ther
e, but I reme mb er one day we went on a field trip to 
somewhere where we had another aunt. And 
when we came back, we were told we 
couldn't go to school anymore. 
That same day. So we wenthad to go home, but we had to  
go th e school and we had--my mo ther had tw o 
sisters in Aachen. Have you ev er heard of 

Aachen?  
 
Q: Been there. 
 
A: On th e Belgium
 
Q: I've been there. 
 
A: Oh, you've been th ere. 
 
Q: I've been there. 
 
A: So the three of us were sent to Aachen
 where there was a Jewi
sh school. And we had 
to walk to school. They had an apartment. 
We had to walk so school, and one day we 
walked to schoolthe school was near the sy
nagogue in Aach
en, that was Kristallnacht. 
We were walking to  school, and we had to pa
ss the synagogue, and were all--we couldn't 
believe it, and so mebody to ld us go home. 
So we went home. We didn't go to school. 
 
Q: What did you see at the synagogue?  
 
A: It was burning. There were all these peop
le standing, and it was burning. So we went 
to--we went back home. And I do
n'tKristallnacht was Novemb er. 
 
Q: I think? 
 
A: 1939. 
 

Q: Yeah. I think was Novemb er 9th I believe. 
 
A: To 10th. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: So we went back to
 my  aunt's . I don't know anything 
about their lives really, but I do 
reme mb er t h at so meti mes in  th
e evening there were people th
ere, and they were not there 
in the mo rning. So  I think my  aunts mu st 
have smuggled th em across the border because 
it was right there. 
 
Q: Of course. 
 
A: Belgium. 
 
Q: Of course. 
 
A: And we didn't  know anything about this, 
but their Kindertransport had been formed, 
and my au nts--I don't know who made arrangeme
nts for us to come to England on th e 
Kindertransport. 
 
Q: We'll co me to that, but first I still have
 a few questions. They may sound almost like 
side questions, but they're curious for me. 
When you would go from Adelsheim to first 
Heilbronn. I think it was the first one? 
 
A: Heilbronn. 
 
Q: And then  after that to Aachen , do you 
rememb er how you got there?  Were you--
 
A: A train. 
 
Q: You went by train. And was there any kind
 of experience did you have on the trains, 
or it doesn't  stay in y
our memory at all?  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: And when you were still in
 the school where you were toge
ther with other non Jewish 
children, did you feel anythi
ng different in the air? 
 
A: I might have, but I don't remember. 
I do remember w h en Iwhen we were in 
Adelsheim, we had to say, "Hail Hitler" to 
the to the teachers, and I don 't know why that 
stands in my mind, but I met a teacher, 
and I was carrying books, and I dropped the 
books and said, "Hail Hitter."  And he came
 over and he said, "You don't have to do 
that."  I don't know why th at stands, but I also
 don't know wh ether that's real or not real. 
 

Q: Why?  Why would you say that? 
 
A: Because it happenedI don't know. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: You know. I was--I was a youn
gster. I just remember that. 
 
Q: Did--was there talk at home about Hitler? 
 
A: I only remember at the elections my moth
er saying, "He won."  I reme mb er that. She 
said, "He won."  And I guess that was Hitler 
who won. You know, the irony is we had a 
lot of relatives in America, and the whole fam
ily had affidavits to co
me to this country, 
but there was this stupid quota, and that's 
whyI remember my fa
ther was the second 
youngest. There was an uncle--younger. They  we
re in business together in Adelsheim, 
and it was a question of wh ether my  father sh
ould co me, whether we should come, or his 
younger brother, and I reme mb er he said his 
younger brother because if he can't work 
anymore he always has his pension. 
 
Q: Your father does? 
 
A: Yeah. So my uncle came over, and we never 
made itI mean my  parents never made it. 
 
Q: So I assume from what you mentioned 
already you ended up 
on Kindertransport? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Can you tell me a little 
bit about what happened ? 
 
A: You know what?  
 
Q: What? 
 
A: I don't rememb er a thing ab
out it. I do not remember. I me
an that's how we came--the 
three of us came. 
 
Q: You were together?  
 
A: Me, Edith, and Ruth. My mother--my moth
er had a sister who went to England--to 
London in '33. And at that time sh e went to
 work for a Jewish fa
mily. They could only do 
domestic work, but anyhow, by 
the time the Kindertransport, 
she'd been there six years 
and her--many friends; so she fo
und us homes. We wereRuth 
was in a hostile, but Edith 
and I were always with priv ate pe
ople. Sh e had found homes for us. 
 
Q: So you don't reme mb er sa
ying goodbye to your parents? 
 
A: I never saw them. 
 
Q: So you were inafter Krista
llnacht, you were still in Aach
en and did you ever go back--
 

A: Kristallnacht was in Novemb
er, and we came in--in March. 
 
Q: So fo r four months later, you stayed in Aachen? 
 
A: Right. With my aunts. 
 
Q: With your aunts. You neve
r went back to Adelsheim? 
 
A: Huhuh. Now, my brother--Esther came out 
too. She was still in 
Adelsheim, and how 
she got on Kindertransport--she 
did, I have no idea. I can't 
imagine that in that small 
Adelsheim thereI think my a
unts in Aachen made all th os
e arrangements I think, but I 
don't know. 
 
Q: So from the time--d o youfro
m the time of Kristallnacht-- 
 
A: November. 
 
Q: November to Kindertranspor
t, do you have any memories? 
 Did you continue going to 
a school next to a burnt down synag
ogue, or was that done as well? 
 
A: You know, I really don't remember. I do re
member N azis comin g  to investigate, to 
look for arms in the house, and they turn ed  the furniture upside 
down. So me things I 
remember, but that I really don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you reme mb er any other 
kinds of ex posure or confront
ation toone of the questions 
I was getting to ask, but didn't get to before
, is did you have any non Jewish German 

friends?  Did you have any contact
 
A: I guess in Ad elsheim, I don't know, but in Aachen-- 
 
Q: Okay. But if it was in Ad
elsheim, do you have any memo
ries of it?  Other children 
that you went to school with?  Kids you played  with? 
 
A: No, but when  we went back and I met 
somebody I went to sc
hool with. But--she 
remembered me; I didn't rememb er her. Bu
t, you know, talki
ng about what you 
remember, my brotherwhy my parents didn 't 
have him go on the Ki
ndertransport I have 
no idea, but he stayed with my parents. A
nd in 1940 when Hitler rounded up all theand 
sent them to Gurs, and Rivesaltes. 
 
Q: Is that where your parents ended up? 
 
A: That where my  parents with my brother. 
 
Q: I see. 
 
A: So he was in camp. 
 
Q: This was in France? 
 

A: And he came over here. I 
don't know when  he came 
over here. With a thousand 
children--you've heard of a thousand ch ildren?
  Came to my  uncle and he spoke only 
French. He couldn't rememb er anything ab ou
t the camp  at all. If you wanted to, you 
know, would rememb er a thing about it. 
And I guess people just drop unpleasant 
memo ries. I don't know. 
 
Q: But you were then how old?
  You were 14 or 15 when--
 
A: When  we came to England it was in March 
'39. In October, that year, I would have 
been 14. 
 
Q: 14? 
 
A: 14. 
 
Q: So you were a 13 a
nd a halfyearold girl? 
 
A: Something like that. 
 
Q: And what were you first memories of Engl
and?  Of London?  Do
 you have anything 
in there that you can--
 
A: My aunt found me a home with a family
 named Pool. They were not Jewish, not 
Jewish. They had a grown son. I mean they c
ould've been my  grandparents. They were an 
older couple. Mr. Pool was the 
chauffeur for the people that 
my aunt worked for. They 
were Jewish, and I went there, and they were
 very typically English. I remember some 
things. In fact, I remember 
the address where we lived. 
 
Q: Where were this? 
 
A: Numb er 10 Elm street in 
England--in London--an outskirt
 of London, and they had a 
maid, and I spent a lot of time in the kitche
n with the maid, and I think when  she asked 
me something and didn't understand, she would 
show me. I think I had to credit her with 
learning English. Of course, 
I was going to  school, and I di
dn't  do too well in school, I 
think. They were never t
oo happy with my  grades.
 
Q: So your aunt worked fo
r a welltodo Jewish family? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And in that family there was also 
a chauffeur, and their names w ere Pool? 
 
A: Noyeah. Right. 
 
Q: The chauffeurs names were P ool? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 

Q: And they , themselves, had a maid at hom
e and--who taught you English; is that 
correct? 
 
A: Well, because--when I didn't u nde
rstand, she went and showed me. 
 
Q: I see. 
 
A: If she said, "Get the sugar,"  didn't know 
what she was talking about. Sh e would go 
and get it and--
 
Q: And show you, and so
 you connected the word? 
 
A: And they always ate in the dining room. Th
is is the British. So 
one day he's sitting, 
and he's going like this (tapping sounds on 
the table) and I said, "Shut up."  Well, you 
would imagine that was the call 
for the maid. And since then, I have never used  shut up 
on anything. 
 
Q: Did he understand 
that you didn't know? 
 
A: Oh yeah. He understood. He understood. 
Mrs. Pool was origina
lly from Scotland; so 
when there was talk of war, there was talk of
 her evacuating to Scotland, and we were in 
the train on September 3rd on our
 way--hadn't left London le
ft to Scotland when war was 
declared. 
 
Q: That meant when Hitler invaded Poland? 
 
A: Right. And I did know she suddenly  got 
homesick; so I don't know how long we were 
there, but it from a small--up north in Scotla
nd. Up north  of Ab erdeen Scotland, a small 
village. And that, you know, they--first of a
ll, I don't think th ey ev en seen a Jewa 
foreigner.  So--but I went to school 
there, and it was a pretty good school. 
 
Q: By that point, that's  half a year. You know,
 when  you went to Sco
tland, you've been in 
Britain for half a year. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Do youin that time, had 
you picked up English enough 
that you could converse, or--
 
A: I think so . 
 
Q: I reme mber we had English lessons in Germ
any, and they probably helped  me, but not 
enough to do a conversation. Notbut it probably helped  me, you know. 
 
Q: But you came from a large fam
ily, and there you were suddenly  just you. No sisters. 
No brother. No parents. 
 
A: Well, just me living with the Pools. 
 

Q: Correct. 
 
A: Now, Edith lived with a 
Jewish family in London. 
 
Q: The Pools weren 't Jewish? 
 
A: No, no. But she lived
 in London, and Edith was the only onewell, Ruth did too with  a 
Jewish family. There were a mo
therin that household, there was a mo ther and a daughter 
and her husband, and the daug
hter and her--his really spons
ored or whatever, but they 
both wo rked  . So th e old lady was the only one at home taking care of Edith, and she was 
a bitch. She thought she had a cheap maid. Th
e Pools were very good to me. We went toI 
remember we went to the s
easide once on vacationthey always
 went to the seaside, and 
we took Edith. We to
ok Edith. RuthRuth liv
ed with a--went to 
a doctor, Jewish doctor. 
They  used  to be doing the workdo you 
have a Bloomsbury H
ouse in England--in 
London? 
 
Q: I did, but not in connection to  the war. Bloomsbury House--
 
A: Bloomsbury House arranged to  take care of
 children. They were 
very involved with 
the Kindertransport. 
 
Q: And were they 
a government agency? 
 
A: No, it was a volunteer--no it was a Je
wish --I don't know who it was because I don't 
think it exists anymore. However, somewhere 
in the last few years, you could send to  
Bloomsbury House for your record . They 
ch ecked on kinders and things like that. 
(?Anhel?) and my  aunt in England kne
w them. I don't know how she knew Doctor 
(?Lobby Nickels?) but they had a maid who 
was German, and my  aunt wasto tell you th e 
truth, I really don't know, but anyhow Ru th we
nt to live with Do ctor Lobby Nickles. But 
then Bloomsbury House evacuated when  the 
bombs started falling in
 London, evacuated 
some of these kinder to hotels, and Ruth wa
s evacuated to a hostel. Sobut Lobby Nickels 
and Nick was Jewish. They 
were Jewish. And how Esther
 got to England with the 
Kindertransport, we don't r
eally know. It was in June. 
 
Q: Of '39. Before the war. 
 
A: Yeah, before the war. I thi
nk they mu st have advertised it for people who wanted to  
take--because they got 10,000 ki
ds out. And a couple in Whal
es had wanted a child, but 
then I think the husband got si ck or something was sick. Now 
this couple, Harrison, lived 

in No rwich, England, and Norw
ich, England, there were a lo
t of shoe factories and Harry 
Harrison wo rked  in a factory that was owned by 
a Jew, and on the bulle
tin board that they 
needed homes for--
 
Q: Children. 
 

A: Children. So  they had one son. And I 
guess he went home and discussed it with his 
wife, and th ey decided to take a girl, and 
that's how Esther got to the Harrison's in 
Norw ich, England. How she got on th
e Kindertransport, we don't really--
 
Q: And she had been born
 when ? '36 did you say? 
 
A: Esther was born inyeah '30let's see '37. 
 
Q: She was a baby. She was a toddler. 
 
A: Two. She was two. Well, Kindertranspor
t went to London, an
d from London she was 
going to Norwich, but my moth
er had written to my aunt 
that-what was happening. So 
she wentmy  aunt went to the station to  see 
Esther, and Esther naturally walked towards 
her. I guess because she looked like my mother. 
I don't really know. But she went to the 
Harrison's, and theHarrison's 
were not Jewish. And th ey 
had one son, 
and you would 
think--Allen was seven, I think, at the time. 
You would think he woul
d be jealous of her. 
He adores--to this day, he ad
ores the ground she walks on
. He's been over herecomes 
over here quite often. And he's likethe parent
s have since died, but that's how Esther got 
to the Harrison's.
 
Q: So all five children--
 
A: Well, yeah. That's ri
ght. All five children. 
 
Q: In Britain. And these are all--
 
A: That photo shows all of them. We were rea
lly very close. This is mythis iswe'r e all 
related except him. 
 
Q: What's  his name? This ma
n--is he from Adelsheim?  
 
A: That'shis name is (?Lock man?) (?Rinehart 
Lockman?) This is he, and this is his wife, 
and they  are the two nicest people I havebu
t these were all relatives. These were 
husbands and ch ildren and wh atev er. And we all were very close. 
 
Q: How--a couple of questions. Do you re
member during the time 
when you were with 
the Pools, did you th ink of 
wh at was going on with your pa
rents?  Do you rememb er 
being wo rried about wh at might be going 
on with them, or was that out of mind? 
 
A: You know, I never--no because 
we were always told that my
 parents would pick us up 
in England and we were coming to
 America. One day I got a tele
gram that said that is our 
new address. I didn't really--you know, you 
really don't think of
 wh at could happen. 
When  it happens, you're surprised, but then  
they were sent to Gu
rs, and I remember--oh 
at 16, I had toI had to go to  wo rk, and I did. 
And then I remember we 
got letters. In fact, I 
gave the letters after all these years--after
 all these years, I ga
ve the letters to--my 
mother's letters to the
 

Q: Museum? 
 
A: Museum. 
 
Q: To the Holocau
stto our museum. 
 
A: Yeah, yeah. Took me a long time, and I don't think they have all of them because they 
were always written to my aunt and me, a
nd she must have kept some. I don't know. 
 
Q: Was it over a period of years that she wrote those letters?  
 
A: What?  
 
Q: Your mo therwas it over a period of 
years that she wrote these letters?  
 
A: Well, it mu st have been just a year or 
two. I don't know how long
 they were in Gurs, 
but I used to save my mone
y and send them money, and th
e last lot of--and that was 
through the Quak ers--through th e Quak ers. 
 
Q: And so you--
 
A: The last lot of money they were not ther
e, and th e Qu akers sent me the money back  
because I mean--it was my--I re
membermy  mother's my father
's leg needed mending or 
something needed  money. I don't  know. I don't
 know. I don't really want to talk about 
that. I don't really want to talk about that. So 
ask me a question. I don't what to talk about. 
 
Q: Well, my next question was going to be 
wh en did you find out that they were no 
longer there?  Was that wh
en you got the money back? 
 
A: Yes, yes. 
 
Q: All right. 
 
A: There's a book out that lis
ts each transport from--I don't 
know if you're familiar with--
can you take this off so I can get that.
 
Q: So you're showing me a 
book that lists those--Rosenfe
ld--Katty and Adolf 19991899 
1898? 
 
A: Oh that's his birthday. 
 
Q: Okay . Adelsheim is
 where they're from? 
 
A: This is a book ___ that lists all 
the transports. It lists all thesee?  
 
Q: Oh my. 
 
A: You've never seen that before?  
 

Q: No. I've never seen this
 book before. It's--it's 600 a
nd how many pages 6645 pages--
no 664 pages. It lists lists 
of deportees by convoy number. 
 
A: By transport. 
 
Q: By transport. It has some photographs in 
the very beginning. It has a description in th e 
beginning, and I'm going to  keep
 on talking, and on page 16
1, it has the transport for 
Bertl's parents. Katty, KATTY Ro senfeld,
 RO SE NF ELD and Adolf Rosenfeld also 
ROSENFELD. Sh e's born on 18.6.
99. He's born on 16.8.98; so
 that means they were born 
in June 1898 and 1899? 
 
A: Right. One was born on the 16
th, and one was born on the 18th. 
 
Q: Okay. And this is a b
ook called The Jewish Commun
ity in Baden (Interviewer 
speaking German) and her father is mentioned 
in this book on page
 34, Adolph Rosenfeld 
(speaking German). It's fi
ne. In the book, it's mentioned that
 on page 35--I'll say it first in 
German (speaking German). In translation, it 
says on the 22nd of October, 1940, the last 
eight Jewish Jews from Adelsheim were de
ported to Gurs, the couple Max and Berta 
Alexander, Heimlich and Earnestine Goldschm
idt, Adolf and Katalina Rosenfeld--who 
were Bertl's parents--as well as A dolph an
d Bona Schorsh, and 
Schorsh is spelled 
SCHORSH. Only Adolf Schorsh 
of the these eight couples was able to get to the United 
States in 1941 after his wife died in the camp.
 And then  (speaking Ge
rman) that says that 
Berta Alexander--the heavily injured Adol
f Rosenfeld and his wife Katalina were 

deported in August '92 through Drancy to 
Auschwitz where they werewhere they  died. 
"Where they met death" is actually the way 
it's explained. Okay. 
Now, you're showing 
me a photograph. 
 
A: This is my  brother. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: This is his wife. 
 
Q: Your brother is Herman is that his name?  
 
A: Herman. And that's his wife. He died in '9
0. Sh e died in November, and he died just 
later. 
 
Q: So November? 
 
A: That's my sister Ruth. 
 
Q: So sh e died in November of--
 
A: Last year. 
 
Q: Of 2009? 
 

A: This is my  sister Esther and her husband, and that's  me and Morris. And my  sister 
Edith isn't there because--I think it was a 
wedding. Her significant other was--had 
Parkinson's, and she couldn't  make it. So that's ... 
 
Q: So this looks like it was taken--
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Late 90's late 80's  or something. 
 
A: So many pictures. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: That's H erman. 
 
Q: When  did you find out details
 of wh at happened  to your
 parents?  Was it long after 
they got that money?  
 
A: I think th ey were deported in --
 
Q: '42. It says in that book. 
 
A: '42. 
 
Q: October '42. So they must have been writin
g letters to you, to y
our aunt, for a couple 
of years? 
 
A: From France. 
 
Q: Yeah? 
 
A: In '82, I don't know their 40ththere was aas
 I told you in  Sennfeld, they have this 
mu seum, and I think in  '82, and I don't reme
mber the year, they ha
d a memorial service 
for all theI think 40 years la
ter. And, you know, Es
ther and I wentRinehart wrote us that 
he had arranged this. He's very active in th
is. Esther and I went for the weekend to 
Adelsheimwe stayed with
 them for this memorial serv ice,
 and somewhere I have pictures 
of it, but I don't know. It really doesn't matte
r. They  had a very touching--and I made a 
speechI wrote a speech in English, and Rinehart
 translated it for me into German, and I 
really tried to give it, but I c
ouldn't. I was just standing up 
there crying. So Rinehart gave 
the speech. But there were a lot 
of people there, and they ha
d to have security. Theyit was 
held in the synagogue in 
this other little town, and th
ey had to have security. 
 
Q: In 1982? 
 
A: I think it was '82. I thin
k it wasthat's when they rounde
d up all the leftovers. All the 
people wh o werewe also metthey couldn't 
go shopping. I rememb er my  mo ther never 
wrote this to us, but they couldn't--they 
could only go shoppinggrocery shopping certain 

times, and then there was nothing left in the 
stores. And we met someone wh en we went 
over there who used  to leave f
ood at my  parents doorstep at night. Because, you know, I 
think the people who lived in 
Adelsheim, there were no Nazi
s. There were no Nazis. We 
also met someone with a son who said--who
 was there when they
 rounded up all the 
Jews. We met someone who watched--this man 
with his father watched all that, and the 
father said to the son, "We ha
ve now lost the war."  I rememb
er th at. This is a great book 
my sister  Edith she worked
 for a bookstoreh ave you lived  in Wash ington lo ng?  
 
Q: I've worked there. I've liv
ed in Washington al
most ten years. I'm not from here, but I 
reme mb er
 
A: Do you reme mb er bookstore Olsson's?  
 
Q: Olsson's? 
 
A: Oh yeah. 
 
Q: She work ed fo r Olsson when  she got me th
at. She worked for Ol
sson for 25 years or 
so. 
 
Q: Amazing book. An  amazing book. It's calle
d Memorial for the 
Jews Deported from 
France 1942 to '44, written by Serge Klarsfeld. 
 
A: Klarsfeld. 
 
Q: Or at least compiled by him. 
 
A: I'm not too su re FranceFrance had some 
program where they paid money to people 
who were deported because this was in France. 
 
Q: I see. 
 
A: Gurs was in France. 
 
Q: That's right. 
 
A: Right? So anybody deport
ed from France got--I don't kn
ow how much money, but we 
got some money because they 
allowed them to do this. 
 
Q: How did your other siblings find out that
 your parents were no lo nger in the camp? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: It wasn't  you who told them? 
 
A: Oh, I don't rememb er. Iprobably. Where el
se would they find out?  Where else would 
they find out?  What else?  
 
Q: Oh gosh. You're a v ery close family. 
 

A: We all are. We all are. 
 
Q: And yet there are very few actual memories
. Maybe because, as you say, it's  blotted 
out because it was so painful.
 And for being so close, ye
t as you were growing up in  
formative years, for you, you were the oldest
. And you were going into adolescence, but 
they spent their ch
ildhoods--and you were all scattered all over the place. So there are 
ironies as to how it is that you beca
me close, you know
, and many other--
 
A: Because in England we saw each other. We
 were in touch. I couldI used toI knew 
someonea boy, who lived in England with hi
s aunt who came fromI forget where he came 
fromh ad a brother here in--in New Yo rk. He
 wanted to  stay, and I couldn't understand 
why the brother didn't come to
 England or why he wouldn
't  want to be with his 
brotherbut he never did come over here. An
d I know people here who have sisters in 
Canada. I just never could up
 understand that. Now, four 
of usno th ree of us, my self, 
Edith, and Ruth , we came over to this country  
in '47. Edith didn't 
come until '48 because 
she was in the British Army. 
She had joined the British Ar
my and was not what they 
called "demobbed" until '48. 
 
Q: That's still ashe was a
 
A: Discharged.
 
Q: She was a teenager. However it wa
sI mean  if you were born in 1925... 
 
A: She was born in '27. 
 
Q: So sh e was 1920 years old? 
 
A: Well, she jointed the British Army. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: So sh e didn't comeand sh e came over here election night, when  Truman was elected. 

And she couldn'twe were so excited about Tr
uman that we really neglected her, and she 
got very upset. But we came over here to liv
e with an uncle and aunt and--and--and life 
was horrible. My aunt was unbelievable. Sh
e was very neurotic. 
So when Edith came 
over here, I--Iwewe had to leave. No other ch
oice. But when Edith 
came, she lived there 
too, and then  we decided we just couldn't do it anymore. I had a job. 
 
Q: What town what this? 
 What city was this?  
 
A: Huh?  
 
Q: Where did you co me over to?  Wher
e did your aunt liv
e?  The American. 
 
A: In Washington. 
 

Q: In Washington. I see. 
 
A: In Washington. We deci
ded we were going--we took
 an apartment to live by 
ourselves. And so Edith and I took an apartmen
t, which at that time were hard to come 
by. I had a job, and she got a job. I rememb
er--and she wasI had been a year, and she was 
getting five dollars more a week than I was; so I got furious with her. I got furious with 
her, but anyhow, we look
ed for an apartment. 
 
Q: So th e two of you th en lived  together, and 
did the others move in with you as well?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was this the first time then
 you could say first in the
 
A: I think th at's how we got close. I don't 
know. I really don't know, but there was a 
teenager there we were in our early 20's, pi
cking up a teaI don't think we could do it 
today. 
 
Q: This is why I say it's so--i
n some ways, it could have go
ne so mu ch the other way. 
 
A: It could have. 
 
Q: It could have gone such 
that the children are all scatte
red in England. They  grow up 
their formative years, have different impres
sions, they don't have 
memories of really 
where they came from, and they
'r e strangers to one another. 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Did your aunts play a 
role, the ones in Britain? 
 
A: I think so . Sh e came over here twice to 
this country  to visit, but I think so. 
 
Q: Yeah, but I don't 
remember in Britain
 
A: She was also neurotic. I lived
 with herafter I had to leave school at 16, she found me a 
room in London and a job, but anyhow I lived
 with her. She was also neurotic. She was a 
chef in--in a restaurant, and she was neurotic
. When  she was angry, she would bake. To 
this day, I do very little baking
 because of--but I think she did.
 I think she did. She kept in 
touch withwith all of us. In fact, I have a 
cousin in London that
 I didn't know was there 
'till my  aunt found her many, many years ago, but--
 
Q: What were your mo ther's letters about wh
en she wo uld write to you wh ile she was in--
 
A: We should be good. We must
 to do this and do that. Sh
e'd give us orders and, you 
know, be good children. 
 
Q: But not mu ch about what
 was going on with her? 
 

A: Not too mu ch. No t too mu ch . 
 
Q: Did your father write? 
 
A: He couldn't write (uni
ntelligible German phrase) she wrote. She wrote. 
 
Q: And you say you kept those 
letters for man y , many years. 
 
A: Oh, yeah. I have--you know
, they made me copies. My
 brotherinlaw had them 
translated into English by so
meone, which wasbecause I can 't read that German scribble 
anymore. 
 
Q: But you did at the time? 
 
A: Oh yeah, but you forget. You know, 
you forget. I don't know. Peoplep eople who 
haven't had this experience and forget things, 
I don't know if they can understand that you 
forget unpleasant--
 
Q: You have to go on. 
 
A: Huh?  
 
Q: You have to go on. 
 
A: I guess so. 
 
Q: You know, when I hear this
, to me, it sounds likeIt soun
ds like you had a lot on your 
shoulders being the oldest one. 
 
A: To bring up Esther was hard. 
 
Q: So you pretty mu ch brought her up? 
 
A: Well, she was a teenager. She was like 10, 11. 
 
Q: When  you--
 
A: When  we took th is apartment in southeas
t Washington. Sh e went to school. I got a 
job. I had trouble getting a jo
b because who would send to 
EnglandI never thought of 
getting references, and who would send to En
gland for referenceswhat?  Then I also 
found a little antiSemit
ism. Some of the places I applie
d to for a jobsomebody later said 
they don't  employ Jews. 
 
Q: In Washington? 
 
A: But, and, you know what?  They really do
n't tell, you know, we'r e not going to hire. 
They  kind of will let you know, 
and you never hear from them 
again. Then  I applied fo r a 
job, and I went there. Went to this address,
 and when  I got to th e address, an old man 
came out, and he said to me, "Are you looking fo
r the job?"  I said, "Yes, I am."  He said, 

"Go in there and ask for Ms. Stopkin."  So--
which I did and she interviewed me, and she 
said, "We'll let you know."   
 
Q: What was the job you were going fo r? 
 
A: That was a wholesale tobacconist and 
candy and paper goods, 
and th ey were all 
work ing a fiveandahalf day week , and they  we
rehe was thinking that--but the old man I 
saw was one of the owners, which I didn't know 
at that time. And they were thinking of 
going on a fiveday week. So th ey needed  extr
a help. You know, I really don't remember, 
but everybodyif I sat at this desk, I didn't 
know what this person was doing. You had your 
job, and that 's what you did. Well, they hi
red somebody. They  were
 thinking of hiring 
someone to cut down  on the wo rking hours, 
and th at person learned the whole thing. I 
learned the whole thing. Sh e called me. I don
't know if either one of you is Jewish. 
 
Q: No. I'm not. 
 
A: There ishave you ev er heard of the Hebrew  Ho me?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: The Hebrew Home is now celebrating its 
100th anniversary, and it was the brainchild 
of somebody called Hyman Goldman, who at 
22 saw this man sitting therethat old man I 
saw coming out was Hyman Gold man. I worked 
for them. And they were very good too. 
I learned the whole thing. 
I ended up being the office ma
nager, and it was a very good 
job. 
 
Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the one be
fore, what job you were going for that you 
didn't  get? 
 
A: Oh. I think it was an
 insurance company. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: And then they used to be a Garfinkel's th
at didn't hire. I don't know if Garfinkel's was 
still around when--
 
Q: No, but I heard of it. It
 was a department store. 
 
A: It was. Yeah, it was. I met Morriswe've
 now been married 56 
years in December. I 
met MorrisI was introduced  to him. But Hyma
n Goldman had a son Er
in who was friends 
with Mo rris's brother, and one day Hy man Go
ldman said to him, "You know, you met 
Morris Esenstad? His brother's checking in to yo
u."  I couldn't believe it. Morris's brother 
was friends with Hy man Go ldman's son. And 
Leon checked with Er
in on me. Did youI 
mean I couldn't get over that. But,
 you know, that's how it goes. 
 
Q: You got married then 56 years 
ago wh ich would have been 1954? 
 

A: Right. 
 
Q: And did you contin
ued work ing at the--
 
A: I continued there 'till I got pregnant, and then I left. 
 
Q: Okay , but then during th at time you an
d Edith were responsib le, before you got 
married, for all of the family. Bringing them up. 
 
A: That's true
. That's true. 
 
Q: So--
 
A: There used toand it's still--Camp Ari, an
d I forgot were the wo
mens'--girls' camp is 
called. Louise. Have you ev er heard of Camp Louise?  
 
Q: No, I haven't. 
 
A: That was started many year
s ago. The problem was what 
to do with Esther over the 
summer, and Hy man Go ldman was on the board 
of Camp  Louise, which is a Jewish 
camp. So for five dollars a 
week, we would send her to camp . He was on the board, you 
know. 
 
Q: And so he made it happen. 
 
A: Yeah, yeah. You know, some
 good things have happened. So me good thing have 
happened. But it's--w
e're all together. 
 
Q: It's I think--
 
A: We're all over the place. Th
ese are my grandchildren. 
 
Q: How many ch ildren do you have?  
 
A: Two. 
 
Q: Two. 
 
A: Allen--I don't know if I have a picture of
 Allen. Oh. That's  A
llen's foster brother. 
 
Q: Ah, yeah. The one who adores her? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: That's my grandson. 
 
Q: Uhhuh. 
 

A: This is Allen. This is my son and hiswife and their two children, and this is my 
daughter's family. I don't think I have a pictur
e of Julie. That's  her, but--you know, at 
differentand this is my uncle's granddaughter. 
 
Q: Well, to me it sounds like an amazing achieve
ment to keep a family togeth er when  so 
mu ch was work ing against that happening. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Germany. How diddid you
--do you and your siblings have
 different attitudes towards 
Germany and going ba
ck and returning? 
 
A: Well, I don't know about Edith. She was in
 Germany durin gwhen she was in the army , 
she was stationed in  Germany, and she would 
tell mean d she and somebody else went to 
Adelsheim. 
 
Q: At that time right after the war? 
 
A: When she was in the army. 
 
Q: Right. British Army. 
 
A: And someone on the street stopped he
r and said, "Are you Ad olf Rosenfeld's 
daughter?"  So that's  what happened. Let's se
e--but their attitude--I remember E sther said 
to me--who can 't remember Germany. She wa
s tooshe was thinking of going back, and 
she said to me, "Did you ever 
consider going back?"  As if th
ey couldget lost in the sea--I 
said, "No. I wouldn't ."  Well, she persuaded 
me to change my mind, but that was in, I 
think '89 or something. I don't rememb er th
e date, but Morris got sick. So they wentwe 
made agreements to go, but Morris got sick
, and sh e and her husband went. So I guess 
that was my attitude at that time. I don't ev
er care to go back, but when Allen went and 
met Rinehart, I changed my  mind. I went to the house wh ere I was born, you know. Have 
you ever lived in a small place?  
 
Q: No-- 
 
A: Whenin a little town
, you see a bunch of people, an
d you wonder why they're there. 
We were standing in  Ko rb. Rinehart had taken us
 there. In front of this, he says, "This is 
the house," and I have pi
ctures of the house. That's  where your father lived. So we were 
standing there, and somebody from the house 
looked out, and they wondered while all 
these people were standing there, and they 
said something. And it was the daughter who 
hadher parents had bought the house from my  
father, and she didn't live in it, but she 
came there once a year to go to the cemetery of 
her parents, and that 's when she stayed in 
the house. So they just happen
ed  to be in th e house and they asked us into the house. We 
went into  the house. Then we went back to
 Adelsheim. The German government had sold 

my  parent's  house to somebody who we went
were invited into th at house, which had 
changed greatly from wh
en we lived in it. 
 
Q: So you had memo ries of
 how it had looked befo re? 
 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 
 
Q: Do you have anydid  you ha
ve any photographs that--let's
 say relatives had gotten in  
the United States that wo
uld have had your family
 before you went on th e 
Kindertransport that would have had pictures
 of the place of where your lived , of how 
your parents looked, and th ings like that?  
We'l l put it on tapethis photo that you're 
showing me of your family before the Kinder
transport, it mu st have been very recent 
before the Kindertransport. 
 
A: It was. I think so . 
 
Q: Because Esther's already--
 
A: She looked a little--yeah, yeah. 
 
Q: Yeah, yeah. And so wh en was the fi
rst time you wentdid y
ou only go back the 
Germany once? Twice? 
 
A: Twice. 
 
Q: Twice? 
 
A: In '90, and in  '95. 
 
Q: In '90 and in '95. But you menti
oned earlier that ther
e had been 1982? 
 
A: Yeah. That mu st have been wrong. 
 
Q: Okay . So it would ha
ve been one of those
 
A: I have to  ask Esther. I don't re
memb er, but they had a me mo rial. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: Forfor I think it was in 202. 
 
Q: In 202. 
 
A: 60 years 60 years. 
 
Q: 60 years. 
 
A: In 202. 
 
Q: Okay . So  that would have meant three times that you've been back . 
 

A: Yeah. That was over the weekend. 
 
Q: Okay . So
 
A: But it was a funny thing, you know, Rinehart
 had wrote us what they were doing, and 
he wrote to me, andI said to Esther, "You 
know, Esther, I think we 
ought to go."  And she 
just went like that. About 2025 years ago,
 I got a letter from someone in Ireland. And 

said, "Dear Mrs. Esenstad, I think we are rela
ted."  Well, he's thet
he man who wrote it is 
a geologist, and he had been in a department
 in Ireland, and he we
nt to Germany for a 
dig, and, you know, they  keep  all kinds of 
records. His mother was Je wish. His father 
wasn't, but when the war started--or beforehi
s Jewish grandmother and his Jewish aunt 
came to liv e with them in England, and they
 got to England because they were an tiNazi 
and they escaped. I think they met at the uni
versity somewhere in 
Germany and went to 
work for the pope. And they bo
th converted to Catholicism, but he said he was greatly 
influenced  by his Jewish grandm
other and aunt. So when  he went back to Germany on a 
dig, he thought he would fi
nd out about his mother. I ha
d written to Germany because I 
needed copies of birth certificates, and that le
d him to Ko rb, and wh en
 he got to Korblater 
I said to him, you know, soands
o is in Englandis in America.
 And he wrote. They gave 
him my  address, and he wrote to me, and he 
told me how we were related. He sent us 
family trees.
 
Q: How were you related? 
 
A: His great grandhe'sPeter is now 60 someth
ing, I would think. He 's mu ch younger than  
we are. His greatsomehow or an other, his grea
t, great grandfather and my  great, great, 
greatwhatever, very far. But, you know, we 
are--and we'v e met and he's been here a 
couple of times. They came for 
Amelia's  Bot Mitzvah, he and his wife. We'v e stayed at 
his house in Ireland and sp ent some time with
 him. But there we are. You never know 
who you
 
Q: You never know. You never 
know. And you'reI think we're comi ng close to the end. 
 
A: Oh I--
 
Q: I think we are, but I want to make sure 
there aren't any questio
ns that I should have 
asked that I haven't asked. 
 
A: Well, I don't know. I wouldn't know. 
 
Q: I'm ___ my self at the mo ment. Is th
ere something that you would want your 
childrenhave you talked about thes
e things with your children? 
 Did they ask?  Were they 
curious about it? 
 
A: You know, this person th at 
I worked  with in England, he came on my  Kindertransport 
too. We never talked about it.
 The Kindertransportchildren di
dn't ask too many questions, 

but they  do know. They  
do know. We all have the most 
wonderful children so, right?  But 
it'sKindertransport has only been talked abou
t since '89, and that is because the 50th 
anniversary of the Kindertransport and the Le
venthal--w hatever her name is--half this 
reunion. Do you know about that?  
 
Q: No, I don't. I don't. 
 
A: She and her sister organized th is reuni
on--50year reunion in 
London. We didn't go. 
They came from all over. They cameI didn't th
inkI don 't think we thought they would 
have such  a turn out. Bu t it's  only been si
nce that time that people have really talked 
about the Kindertransport. We have an orga
nization herea branch. There's a national in 
New York. That's  it. W h at else. 
 
Q: Youyou lost your parents, let's say 
at age 13 when you 
were sent to the 
Kindertransport. You never saw them again after that? 
 
A: Never saw them again. 
 
Q: What do you think they be
queathed you, each of them 
as a personality?  What do you 
think thathow did th ey influence your life? 
 
A: I think family. 
 
Q: Yeah?  
 
A: I think so . They all were very close with 
their siblings, I think. And I rememb er all the 
letters from my mother--we sh
ould do this, and we shoul
d do that, and we shouldyou 
know. She gave us orders because I don 't 
think--I mean it's unimaginable, Auschwitz. 
They  would not have--
 
Q: She didn't think that what's what would be--
 
A: No. I'm sure they didn't. You could dr
iv e yourselfif you knew wh at was going to  
happen to  you, you could
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Go mad. So you have all the things you want to know?  
 
Q: Oh probably a lot mo re, but
 right now, unless there 's so
mething that you would want 
to add to what we'v e talked about. 
 
A: What's  going to  happen with  this?  
 
Q: I'll tell y ou in a minute, but then at this 
point then I'll say thank you. Thank you fo r the 
interview. 
 
A: I'm sorry we got so mixed up.
