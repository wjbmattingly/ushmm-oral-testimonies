other mother, m y stepmother, and her name was 
Maria Louisa
, and Œ and she was 
born in 
Dura ng o
,
 
Mexico
, in this little town of 
Topia
. And so, when I lived in 
Pasadena
, I grew up with what you call half-cousins. I Œ  
to me, the yt u
rned out t o 
be more cousins than m y own cousins, cause I didn™t know m y cousins very well. 

Q: And what was i t like growing up? How were you Œ where did you go to school?

village, with no si dewalks and no pavement at all. And a school call Œ elementary 

school called 
Freeman
(ph) school , and where Mexicans Œ Mexican-Americans 
could not associate with Americans, at that  time. So we Œ we were all Mexican-

Americans, bornin the 
United States

Americans. 
Q: Do you know why not? 
A: Beg pardon? 

Q: Do you know why not? What did the y Œ were the reasons why, or Œ 

A: We never knew. It was just a question mark that we had in our minds, that why

isthat m y teacher 
Œ and I remember her, Mrs. Œ Mrs. 
Greenho f
(ph), her husband 
was the conductor, Mr. 
Gr
eenho f
(ph), and he turned out t o be my Œ 
m y godfather

in first communion, were a very nice person, even though the y were t eachers at that 
school. 
Q: So you had separate classes than the other students? The American students, you 

had separate classes from t
h em?
 
A: No, Americans were in Œ were t o associ ate in tha Œ in that school at all. 
Q: And how did t hat affect you, as a child? 
A: Well
, we Œ it was just the quest ion, we Œ we didn™t know why, until we found 

out that even if we went to 
Brookside Park
, up towards the 
Rose Bowl
, and Œ and 

we went swi mming, that we were to swi m in t he Œ in that  area where only Mexican-

Americans swam
. And I knew that the blacks couldn™t swi m in our area, wer Œ 
because we weren™t t o associate wi th them. And only the whites were to Œ to swi m 

in their area. 
Q: And how did Œ how did that make you feel, as a child?

A: My father remai ned like a person incognito, because he went about  his own 

business, never thought  about Œ of us, or sa ying well, don™t worry, or nothing. Just 

kept along. So, as I started to grow up, little by little, there m y Œ 
with m y half

cousins Œ t here was 
Ernetto
(ph)
 Priatto
(ph), which was Œ he was the son of the Œ 
of the aunt of my mother Œ m y stepmother. So that was a family t oget her. And so 

we had selli ng papers in the corners, delivering papers to houses. And we walk from 

[indeciphera bl
e]
 it was called, a li ttle barri o. We head down 
Correro
(ph) 
Street
, 
to 
Hill Street
, then get ready for the N-New Year™s day, and sell papers for 
everybody to Œ and so t hey use the paper, newspapers for pillows, or cover up while 
the 
Rose 
parade was able to start.  

Q: And did you go to church, growing up? 

A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: Did you go to church? 

A: Our church was in Œ right there at the 
barri o
, which the name was 
Saint 
Joseph
™
s 
church. And with time, I found out i t disappeared. But t hat was when I left 
fo
r 
Mexico
. 
Q: So, why did you go back to 
Mexico
?  
A: At the ti me, well, it was all strange, that  my mother st arted to Œ 
o r my 

stepmother, that I call her mother, I noticed that she started to have somebody pack 

her furniture, and all  our furniture, and Œ and then the truck came by and picked up 

all that furniture, and t hen as Œ well, we asked her, we sa ys, what™s happened, where 

are you going? She sai d no, we are all goi ng. And I sa ys, where are we going? She

says, we™re going to 
Mexico
. And I sa ys why?  He says, because we were told to 
leave the 
United States
. And si Œ but, does my father know about  it? He knows 
about it. My father was in 
Mexico
, and Œ and he had a good job, he had graduated 

from engineering, and became a Œ an architectural engineer, and Œ 
and
 all things 
that we didn™t even know, while we were growing. 
Every door 
Œ everything was 
incognito. A
nd so, at that ti me, was Œ by t hat time, I was about around nine and a 

half years ol d, close to 10, and Œ and where are we heading, I asked my mother. She 

said, we™re heading toward 
Durang o
, 
Durango
,
 
Mexico
. And so, when we arrived 
in 
Durango
, I remember that m y father had a house rented out for us to live, just a 

few days before the y get a house. And so I remember sleeping on top of the Œ one 

of those big suitcases, t hat you used to travel i n a big ships, at one time. And was 

funny how we had to j ust sleep on top of that, and fall down. And ki d™s stuff, that 
we 
[indecipherable]
. So that Œ t hen I started to grow up then, and my father begi n 
to increase his title, his engineering, his business. He became well-known. And it 

was altoget her a different custom of life, living in 
Mexico
, compared t o in the 
United States
. 

Q: How so?  

A: Oh, the y call me the 
gringo
, because I was born in 
United States
, and 
that I 
know half English and half Spanish. And that was kind of difficult, but before I

knew it, I had a teacher tell me, he sa ys, I want  you to hel p me to teach these ch-
children to speak English. And she was an English teacher, so I tag along. 

Q: And what was Œ 
so y
ou were going to school, and your father was now working 
Œ where was your father working now? 

A: My father became a director of public works for the state of 
Durang o
. And Œ 
and so, at t hat ti me as I Œ as I started to grow up, he Œ it was ti me when the 

Olym

Mexico
 was the named nation to Œ for the 
Olympics, world Olympics. And so my father decided to build a big Olympic 

swimming pool, which was a hundred meters l ong, by 50 meters wide, with all t he 

decorations, as a Œ 
a 
Œ an Olympic swimming pool would look l ike, and with a Œ 
a 
transmitter along the si de of that swi mmi ng pool so that people coul d listen to the 

music, and Œ and promenade. So, while I was going to school, we all got excited 
about the Olympics, but then there was two ot her fellows and m yself, we al Œ they 
all Œ alwa ys called us t he Œ the three musketeers. And I li ked to make Œ do exerci se, 

and so I Œ I trained re Œ by looking at the books my father had of 
Charles Atlas
, 

well-known then. And every morning we used to Œ well, these fellows would come 

over and pick me up, and we™d go swimming at the swimming pool, five in the 

morning. And then about seven, we™d head back to s Œ to school . This time it was 

about Œ the war had started, the 40s, 1940. And

Jose Blanco 
Œ

Which he knew the 
Morse 
code very well. So we went out swimming, and 
Pepe 
Blanco
(ph) says, 
Atlas

 Atlas
, there™s a spy going on. I said, why, what do you 
know? We are very low voice, because we hear music in the dist ance, and I was 
from the transmitter. He sa ys that t here™s a 
Morse

dashed out that swi mming pool, we headed back to school. And the y went to 

school, and I went t o his office, my father™s office, and I knocked quick at the door 

of his office, and I told him about the situation. And soon he Œ before you knew it, 
he had them arrested. And sure enough, they were spying for the Nazis, the 
Germany
. Well, I didn™t realize then that we had a Œ a German colony i n Œ in 
Mexico
. And here I was associated well with t he groups of fellas, Boy Scouts. We 
had formed a Boy Scout group, and our scout master, Boy Scout  master was the 

Schraeder

family that owned a hardwood store there in

Philippsbourg

A: It™s a little town of 
France
 and 
Germany
, that it has a highway, and they Œ 
th ey 
used to call it the 80 Œ the 
co
rner 80. I don™t know why the y used that term, but 

anyway, it was 
Philippsbourg
. And from 
Phil ippsbourg
 to 
Falkenberg
 was just a 
few kilomet ers to where the Œ that hill was.

Q: O
k a y.
 
A: At the ti me that we were going to do our f Œ up front, I hear somebody call me, 

medic, medic. I turn around, and 
I 
[indeci phera ble]
 the fella, and I says, what do 
you want? I says, I™m afraid, I don™t want t o go. 

Q: Was thi s during the battle? 

A: In the battle. 

Q: What was going on around you? 

A: We 
Œ we were going to head back to Œ I mean, we were going t o head up the 
front, towards the battl e. And he Œ he want ed Œ he was afraid to face the battle. And 

so I had to tag him, and call hi m as a casualt
y.
 
Q: Do you remember his name? 

A: No, I don™t reme Œ no, I don™t remember his name. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: At that time there were fellas that Œ where you had to Œ or the y commit suicide. 

And that Œ just sign a Œ a card where he heads back to the medical corps, and call 
hi m a casualty, or he would commit suici de, or shoot at everybody. 

Q: At the Americans, at his colleagues?  

 
Interview with Anthony Acevedo

A: American. American. Oh, there would be fella that they were Œ 
they were 
afraid 
and Œ and t he y start ed l ose that Œ t hat feeling of Œ want to do somethi ng, and yet 
they cannot do anyt hing at all, because the y couldn™t thi nk any more, and the y said, 

could you baptize me? Or he says, I don™t know how to pra y, I™m afraid. And so I 

would more or less remind hi m a pra yer, or whatever. I says, the Œ 
I™
d ask them 
what religion. No religion. They had no faith, and the y weren™t taught to have faith, 

and so this Œ these were fellas that y- you Œ 
you 
come across.
 
Q: What faith were you? 

A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: What religion were you?  

A: Catholi c. 

Q: Catholi c. Did you have a pra yer book with you, or how did you help them pray? 
A: I pra Œ 
I had m y prayer bookwith me, and 
Œ and I would use some phrases that 
wouldn™t be too long, but enough t o Œ for that person, that soldier, to motivate hi m, 

make hi m feel motivated, and feel free of fear. That™s what he was, he was afraid. 

Q: So you weren™t just a medic, you were their chaplain. 

A: I had to use the Œ th -the Œ the chaplain Œ we had the rights to do that, for purpose 

of trying to save li ves.

feel?

A: It made me feel that Œ more opened, more relaxed, more faith, more strong. And 
that™swhat gave me 
Œ i nvigorated me not t o be afraid. 
Q: So how did you feel going into battle, and what did you see around you? 

A: To me, I had questi on marks i n up here, and I said, God help me, and there I go 

with the rest of them. And Œ 
and I™min your hands.
 
Q: And what was i t like that Œ those first few days going into battle, what did you 

see?
 
A: Afraid that any moment wi Œ a German was going to sh-shoot in where or what 

direction. Causewhen I 
Œ at that ti me, when I had turned over that Œ t hat fellow, a Œ 
a sergeant asked the captain, what are we going to do with these Germans? They 

had captured about 30 - 40 of them, and they had them all by the wire factory, to t he 

side of the wire factory, and so the sergeant went over and said, captain, what do we 
do with them? Take care of them. 
Q: This is taking care of the Germans. 

A: Take care of the Germans. Well , you can use the termi nology in t wo wa ys. Take 

care of the
m by 
Œ by guard them, don™t do anything to t hem, because the y™re 
prisoners, or shoot  them. Well, that was t he i ncorrect. He shot them, all of them. 

Q: The American. 

 
Interview with Anthony Acevedo  
 
October 13, 2010 
 
 
 
21
 
A: And Œ and that gave me a feeling of, why did they have to shoot them, since the y 
were al
ready in our hands, with no equipment. And the y were not endangering our 
lives. A prisoner of war is a prisoner of war. 

Q: Did you see the shooting take place?  

A: But I submit Œ I submit ted that report. That  was wrong, what the y did there. 
Q: Did anything Œ were there any repercussion for that American? 

A: I never knew. I never knew. But wa Œ t hat was one of the cases where I Œ it kept 

me 
Œ 
in my mind. So 
Œ and so that was, at the t ime, before heading out into Œ with 
m y duffel bag and everything. And so, when I was up in that hill, and I took care of 

the fellas Œ 

Q: How did Œ 

A: Œ first aid.

assignment, where m y duffel bag bursted up i n flames, and then Œ  
Q: Where was that? 

A: That was before gett ing to 
Fa l kenberg
.  
Q: Oka y. 
A: We were heading back, and the assignment that the group had been assigned to 
do away with Œ annihilate certain pillboxes that there were Germans. 

Q: Whatare pillboxes?
 
A: That™s where Germans had equipment, the secret equipment, t he missiles, or Œ or 

[indecipherable]
 bombs that the y were shoot ing. And so, us medics didn™t know 

what was t hen Œ what t hey were doing, what were the assignments, i t was secret. 

And us medic, you just  take care of the sick and the wounded. So that was when, 
upon headi ng back, they had finished the assignment, and that was Œ it was headi ng 
back, and when I heard that the Œ t he sound effects of the medic, medic, and Œ and 

you can 
Œ 
you 
Œ you find the echo from all si des, and a 
[i ndeciphe
rable]
 the echoes 
just travel in the Œ i n the Œ in the forests. And t here was snow up t o your waist, so 

your voice gets to where you sa y a word here, and it echoes over t here. 

Q: And where were you during this? 

 
Interview with Anthony Acevedo

A: I was on top of the ridge, heading Œ 
march
i ng to head back to the Œ to the Œ t he 
wire factory. 
Q: And what town was the wire factory in?  

A: 
Philippsbourg
. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And so we f Œ that™s when my Œ when I headed down t he Œ the Œ the slope, I Œ I 
tripped on a Œ on the branches. And as I tri pped, m y duffel bag went up in the air. 

And I th Œ it went up in the air, the machine guns started, and the y were firing at 

me. And so I fell in the Œ on the ground, and I sl Œ I crawled into my Œ m y hel met, 

and then I crawled to where my fellows were. And so I Œ I started to give them first 

aid, and fix it up, and Œ and there were fellows that had a l eg blown up, and so I had 

to do my first aid t ourniquet, s-sew it up, and cut it off. 
Q: How did that make you feel? Was that t he first time you had t o do something 
like that?  

A: I had experience l earning, as Œ if you want to be a doct or, you have to be Œ do 

what you have to do. And I did it with Œ with all m y heart, and feeling that young 

fellows the same Œ m y age, do or die. But fear nothing and injected him with 

mor
phine, and Œ to prevent the pai n, and Œ and repair that wound. But

[indecipherable]
 blown up, fix it up, whatever you can do it, to stop the bleeding. 
Wounds, everything, and fears of anything yet. Keep the morale going. 

Q: Mm-hm. And how was it for you, this Œ you know, you™d grown up in 
Mexico
, 
and now you™re in t his foreign country, in a Œ what was t hat like for you? Was thi s 

totally different from Œ I Œ I mean, you™d never experienced anything l ike this. How 
are you feeling at that time? 
A: To me, I Œ I Œ when I left 
Mexico
, I Œ I wasn™t too happy living in 
Mexico
, 
because I was used to my being i n Œ in good old 
Pasadena
. That™s where I wanted 

to be all the ti me, because if I turn back a littl e bit over there, livi ng in 
Pasadena
, 

m y cousin andIwould ha
ve a little scraper, and we buy ice, big cubes of ice, and 

scrape it. And that fill up in a cup, and soak it with 
Kool-Aid 
flavors and sell it for 

three cents a cup, going down the road, house by house. And that™s how we Œ and 
every penny, or whatever penn
ywe made, we™dgiveit to my mother, or 
Œ part of 
our lives. So, things like that moti vated you, t he Œ 
doing things that you™renot 
supposed to do. 

Q: So, thinking about your family, rememberi ng home Œ 

A: Yes.

 when Œ then I 
saw Œ I saw 
M
urray
 
Pruzan
. I had lost my buddy, and Œ and Captain 
Schmidt
(ph) 
was very seriously wounded, he was unconsci ous. And so I did what I can to Œ to 
continue on part of the Œ what 
M
urray
 had left, he wasn™t  able to complete, when 
he was wounded, or kil led. And a sa Œ same thing I did with the other fellows that 
needed wounds that Œ per the condit ions that us medics had to do. 

Q: How did it make you feel when you came across 
M
urra y
, when you found him? 
A: Well, it™s funny. I prayed for him, God had taken him, and I said, I told you
 

M
urray
, I told you not to fear, that you were going to survive. That™s all I had to Œ I 
couldn™t do anything el se but to pra y for hi m, because his soul had been taken. And 
he was a very kind person, very docile type. So we headed back down the hill, t he y 
took u Œ forced us t o take our shoes off.

couldn™t go because the Germans had taken 
Fa lkenberg
 Œ I mean, had taken 
Philippsbo urg
, the wire factory. And that Œ that to head for 
Falkenberg
. And so 
we headed up there, t hat we had to entrench ourselves, and get Œ 
dig inand make 
our own foxhole, and Œ until what ever happened, because t he Œ our planes were 
protecting t he area, permit ting the Germans to go up the hill. But it turned too late, 

because we ran out of ammunition, and the Œ the Œ then the Germans had more 

control of the area, and we couldn™t do it any more there, our buddies couldn™t do it 
any more, because they ran out of ammo Œ ammunition. 
Q: Did Œ I™m sorry, did you know what the other units in the area were doing, or

how did you take care 
of yourselves

come 
up with the two fellas, they would shoot us all. Yet, when we were forced to

But the y were puni shed, they were put int o a dungeon, where the y can see la Œ t he

American Jews with names Jewish, take two st eps forward. And a lot of our fellows

Œ he sa ys, I held onto it . I didn™t gi ve a shi t. Pardon the expression. 
Q: That™s oka y.

to get about 85 to Œ close to 90 fellas, and then Œ 

Q: Did they step f Œ 

A: Œ then the Germans came selecting.  

Q: Did the Jewish soldiers step forward? Did t hey identify themselves? 

A: Oh yes. By name, or the wa y the y looked, t he Germans pointed their finger, or

Q: How many Americans were selected? 

A: Three hundred and fifty. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Three or 350. 

Q: And what did they t ell you, after the selecti on? 
A: Nothing. They woul dn™t even talk to you about nothi ng, absolutely nothing. For 
a while the y didn™t say nothing, until you were to be completely segregated from 

the whole groups. You were nothing but a Œ a little sel-selection here on one side, 

and to leave the place, and says Œ and the t erm was that we were to travel to a place 

that we were supposed to have oh, the unique place to pla y ball. We™d have motion

Stalag IX-B
 that Œ that day? 
A: The following 
d a y.
 
Q: So what did Œ 
how did you 
Œ what did they do to you, the next day?  
A: Put us on a trai n. 
Q: What ki nd? Like a Œ 

A: A boxcar, where you couldn™t kneel, you couldn™t squat, for six days, in the Œ in 

those boxcars. And fellas couldn™t defecate at all, the y had to do i t right there, right 

Œ and for six da ys, you Œ and you couldn™t  eat nothing, you coul dn™t have nothing to 
eat, nothing to drink. B ut the Œ the snow t hat hit the Œ from the cracks, you tried t o 
lick it, or p -poke your hand through the slot window, to get the drops of water, from 

the rain. Until we came to 
Berga an der Elster
, which is part of the Œ the 

compounds of 
Buchenwald
. 
Q: What di d you see when you arri ved at 
Berga
? 
A: It was so snowy that  you couldn™t catch the gli mpse very well, but you see like a

the train, and to head to the area, that turned out to be barracks that were ugly, ugly, 
like falling apart. So, in other words, the barracks were that the cracks Œ 
when you 

were inside, you could see the Œ the wind, feel  the wind coming i n through the 

cracks
. 
Q: And how many men per barrack? Was it Œ were you all  together in one? 
A: One barracks is Œ we were divided into groups, to fit 60 to 80 in a Œ in a Œ in a 
barracks, with a Œ three bunks. Three slots Œ

A: The y had them separated from us. They were the Jewish prisoners that had Œ 
they had them separated from us. 

Q: What was your first impression when you saw those prisoners? Di d you know 

who the y were? 

A: We didn™t know. We didn™t know Œ we didn™t know until afterwards, we found 

out that th
e 
Œ the y were being worked in t he mi Œ in the t unnels. So, when they 

selected our groups int o si Œ 16 per group per tunnel, there were 11 t o 12 tunnel s. In 

 
Interview with Anthony Acevedo

each tunnel, they had fellas go in and dig into the tunnels, to enlarge the areas inside 
of the tunnels, to Œ well, we didn™t know why t he tunnels were being built. 

Q: Did you have to work in the tunnels, or were you given a different job? 

A: Us medics were to only take of the Œ the sick. And then, what I did was, I asked 

the commander, why not? If a fellas gotta work in that tunnel toda y, gi-give hi m a 
day off tomorrow, and have another group work for him, so kind of liberate him 
from it. 

Q: So what was their work schedul e? 

A: The y slapped my face. The y slapped me, t hey hit me, because I was supposed to 

say nothing. But t hat was not 
[indecipherable]
 I™m a medic. You™re supposed to Œ I 

said, don™t we have a doctor? They told us they had a doctor, but that  wasn™t true . 

So we didn™t have a doctor. So what we were doing is trying to take care of the 
fellows. 
Norm Fel dman
(ph), as well as others like that, worked in the tunnels, and 
they breathed the silt, that Œ that came out of the Œ the rock. And that damaged the 

po Œ the lungs. Some of the fellows, like 
Norm
, would 
Œ would 
tell me whatthe y 
did was try to we
aken t he 
Œ the Œ t he dynamite, so that the Œ the y wouldn™t be too 

powerful 
[indecipherable]
. But I laugh when he tell me about the things. Totally 

laughed. 

Q: Like what Œ what other things? The y tri ed to do sabotage.  

 
Interview with Anthony Acevedo

A: Sabotage to make them Œ and then they would sabotage the Œ the cars that Œ that 
carried the rock, to dump it out to the si de of the la Œ the river. And Œ and this Œ or 

damage in t he Œ the springs, of the Œ of the cart, when you pull, woul d fall apart, 

without the germ Œ Germans knowing that it was being done that way.  

Q: And what were you doing whil e the y were working in the tunnels? Did you work 
in the tunnels? 
A: No. 

Q: What was your job? 

A: No, I Œ I™d go i nto t he tunnels, very on and off, when the y let me, to see that t he 

Œ what the y were doing, and th-that Œ th-that they were okay, and I™d tell them, I™d 

say he™s not well, or pl ease let him out, let hi m rest. He™s not Œ he™s weak, and 

you™re not feeding him, he™s not eat ing. He has diarrhea, the dysent ery, diarrhea, 
everything he had, the fellas. 
Q: So you were still being their medic. 

A: Ye Œ beg your pardon? 

Q: You were still being their medic. 

A: Their medic, yes. 

Q: And what was your Œ so, did you Œ did you have another job specifically at the 

camp, th Œ a role? 

 
Interview with Anthony Acevedo

51
 
A: No, nothing, nothing. Nothing a Œ but  just a Œ keeping up wit h a Œ the Œ 
with the 
sick. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And seeing that  they were taken care of. Sometimes some of the fellas started to 

feel that the y wanted to escape, and Œ and when the y tried escape, they wanted to do 
something without the German knowing about  it, but it Œ it didn™t 
faze
 us too well, 
because the Germans were too smart in t hat respect. 
Q: Did anyone manage to escape?  

A: There was two, t hree of them that escape. 
Cohen
. 
Co hen
 was Œ did escape, but 
then he was killed
. But there™sanot her 
Œ 
Latel l
(ph) escaped, and he managed to 
escape. And 
Cohen
, when the German asked me, or told me to verify, to sh Œ as a 

medic, that he was shot  because he t ried to escape. In other words, you shoot a 
person from a distance, oka y, you gonna hit hi m i n the back. So, the German asked 
me, I want you to check and to see that he is being Œ he was shot tryi ng to escape. I 

says, can I turn hi m over? Can I look at hi m? And the y™re 
sa ying okay. Andthe 

Germans was shooting in the forehead, with a wooden bullet. What di d the y do? 

The y stand him on a wall Œ behind the wall, and shoot hi m in t he head, then the y 

waxed the hole. What does a bullet Œ wooden bullet do? It™s just  that it shoots i n, 

and splinters inside the Œ the head. Oka y, they were using that as an excuse. They 

 
Interview with Anthony Acevedo

thought that I wouldn™t identify the wax that covered the hole. So the Germans were 
slaughtering our men that tried to escape. 

Q: And the conditi ons were obviously much worse in 
B erga
?  
A: Well, the y started t-to Œ force us to take our clothes off, and just sl eep with their 

underwear, and the y would force me to take all the clothes into a shack, just a little 
bit outside the barracks, to prevent anyone from escaping. So thi s got worse, 
because the sleeping without the clothes, i t was dangerous for your health. Getting 

worse pneumonia, and all the qua Œ the effects, the side effects that you would get, 
without being able to eat at all. 

Q: Right. Did they Œ I mean, what kind of food were you provided with? Were you 

able to Œ were the men able to get anything, any nourishment, or any wa Œ or did 

the y receive any packages, or Œ I mean, some camps, people were abl e to receive 
mai l, or Red Cross packages.  
A: In one occasion we received a package, a Red Cross package, and it was di vided 

into four to a package, or six to a package. The package was meant to be for one. 

One per pack Œ one per person. And that™s how I got 
m y d
-diary, from one of those 
packages. 

Q: So you received the diary Œ 

A: I received the book Œ

Q: Œ in 
Berga
. 
A: Œ in 
Berga
, empty book, yes. And not at 
Bad Orb
. And I used that for that 
purpose. But, I mean, the Germans had stacks of Red Cross packages, stacked up in 

a 
Œ in a warehouse. 

Q: So, what was an average da y at 
Berga
 for all of you? Was there anyt hing as an 
average da y? Was there any typical da y? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. And it Œ st uff Œ tea to drink was nothing but just grass, boiled it into tea. And 

the same thing would be if we got a soup with a few spuds into it, and to flavor it, 

we got Œ we receive harsh water, no taste at al l, and with cockroaches, and rats 

mixed into it. And it would make you sick from t he stomach. 
Q: Was there any interaction with the other prisoners? The other political prisoners, 
in the other part of the camp?  

A: We didn™t know anything about them, but j ust that the y sta yed a Œ a distance 

from us. 

Q: Did they work together in the mines, in the tunnels? 

A: No, no, they had Œ 
didn™t mix withus.
 
Q: Oka y.

A: But from underground, we found out why t he Germans had us Œ had these men 
working in those t unnels. We found out later t hat Œ that those tunnels were being 

made because the Germans were developi ng secret equipment, missi les, buzz 

bombs, and other equipment that t he y had i n mi nd, that they were hiding in those 

tunnels. 
Q: And the physical conditions were atrocious. What were the Germans who ran the 
camp like? How di d they t reat you guys? 

A: The y treated us very bad, because the fact t hat the y beat them. They beat them 

with the butt of their rifle, and poke them Œ would force, say, to get a Œ a ti Œ 
a 

railroad tie, and carry it into the tunnels, t o repair the railroad ties. And the y coul d

bombers would be heading for Œ it would be about 500 
B-17s

A: The y would bomb t he sites. And you could feel when it bombed t he areas, the y Œ 

the windows woul d Œ the Œ the glass would crack, the vibration of the bombing. But 
things like that. Another thing what we found out, we were Œ got a hundred grams 
of  bread per week. Now a hundred bread Œ grams of bread is not much for every Œ 
but it was a mix of barley with sawdust, ground glass, and ground sand. And the 

barley to camouflage Œ and the y make that black bread black because the y Œ the 

Germans loved the black bread. And it Œ t hat caused damage in your stomach.

interview with 
Ant
hony Acevedo

, we left off, you were talking about your 
diary, and I was asking you what information did you record in your diary, in 

Berga
?  
A: I tried to keep my, as close as possible, as the informat ion related t o the 
condition of my fellow men, because the fact that, more or less, I knew that ma ybe 

someda y, it would be a valuable thing for Œ for us, to know that Œ that there was 

important Œ I was concerned at the condition, knowing t hat ma ybe I was at risk 

carrying that diary, because a couple of times, it dropped out of my pants. I carried 

it right Œ ri ght insi de of my b-belt. And on one occasion, one of the guards picked it 

up. It happened to be one of the good guards, it was the Austrian fella that Œ he said, 
what are you writing? I said, just my memoirs of the ca Œ the beautiful country. Just 
faked it, to let hi m know that I wasn™t writ ing anyt hing wrong. And so, he believed 

me. But I tried to keep it as much as Œ secured as possible, as I went along, 

especially when you would be on the march, and you™d Œ  it would drop on you, then 

you would lose it. 

Q: Did the other Œ your fellow American soldiers that you were wi th, did they know 

you were keeping the diary?

A: I™d find ti me for just  a Œ where I™d sit, or whether I™d be in the barracks, when 

we were then, or where Œ when we were on the march, I tried to more or less fake it. 

Like, I™m going to sleep, I™m falling asleep, and well, everybody would doze off, 
and no one knew what I was doing. 
Q: Why did you keep a secret from your fellow soldiers? 

A: Just to prevent Œ in case I would run in danger of one of them sa yi ng somethi ng 

to me.
 

Q: To you, or to t he Germans? 

A: To the Germans. 

Q: Mm-
hm.And what w
ere the events leadi ng up to the march from the camp?

with all the allies, al most coming together, and Œ and so t he commander, 
Mer
z
 and 
Metz
, threatened us t o the march towards 
t he Bavarian mountains,where 
Hitler
 
lived. And on the march we Œ I saw Œ if the other fellows see Œ seen also, if they 

noticed, but I saw t hat the Œ the Germans were carrying umpteen Œ 
in trucks 
Œ 
umpteen frames of pai ntings, that they had with them, towards 
t he mountains. And 

the treasures that the y were stealing from there.

the Germans tell you to do? Do you know where Œ what direction you walked in? 

A: No, just go Œ get out  and start marching, walking down the hi ghway. And as we 

passed 
Hof
, a li Œ a town of 
Hof
, 
Germany
, we noticed some of our fellows were 
getting s Œ more sicker and sicker, and they were dying off. And so then we were 

experiencing an attack 
by
 our jet fighters, agai nst the Germans. They™re firing at ta 
Œ at tanks, German tanks. And so we had to dodge the Œ t he fire, and Œ or towards 

the edge of the highway. Otherwi se, we woul d have been slaught ered by the 

machine guns. 

Q: Did you see other prisoners, as you were marching, from other camps?

A: There was a secti on where we experienced the most awesome thing that we ever 
saw. And, since we noticed that the Germans were Œ had behind us miniature tanks, 

operated by remote control, and if we intended to escape, or do somet hing, they 

would throw those tanks at us. But the y were behind us, guarding us. They were 

operated by some German, I don™t know how the y do Œ were doing 
it
, but wi Œ they 
had an advanced operation. But up ahead, we noticed that the Germans were 

slaughtering political prisoners, we call
ed
 t hem political prisoners, but it turned out 

to be the y were Jewi sh fellas, and families, chi ldren, mothers, and older fellas. And 

they were hanging t hem to the barbed wires, as we went along. Hanging on the 

barbed wires because t hey tried prob Œ escape, go over the fence. 

Q: Where was this, on t he road, on the way to 
Hof
?  
A: On the road to Œ on the f Œ o-on the road to wherever the 
[indeci pherable]
. And 
then the Œ further Œ still further up ahead, then we had to pull out of the highwa y, 

and I don™t know why t hey made us Œ to make a shortcut, or whatever, but we saw a 

pile of Œ same thing, of women and children, fami lies, the y were al l slaughtered, 

murdered. And the y weren™t just days, that  happened Œ happened i nstantly, ahead of 

us, they were doing it.

Q: What physical condition were you in? 

A: Oh, we were just almost at the tail end of where we just Œ our men were 

dropping Œ  dropping off the highway, out of Œ out of the lines of the march. Our cart 

that we pul led and pushed, was full of our sick men, and we coul d barely pull, 
because of our strength, there was no strength at all at th Œ with all of us being 
without food and water. 

Q: What di d you Œ sorry. 

A: And Œ and up ahead, we kept on going, and some were dropping out of the lines, 

and Œ and so, we™d stop by a barn, and rest for a minute, or whatever they would let 

us rest. The snow started to melt, which was st er Œ April, part of April , when the 

snow is getting less and less, but it™s still cold. 
Q: What di d you do at night? Did you march all night? 
A: Kept on marchi ng. Kept on marching someti mes, kept on marchi ng, until t he 

Germans told us t o pull over and Œ 
and take a break.
 
Q: And di Œ were you given any food at Œ when you were able to stop? 

A: No, not until one Œ at 
Hof 
Œ we got int o 
Hof
, and they Œ they gave us boiled 

eggs, and spuds, but that was just then. After t hat, we kept on marching again, and 

some fellas tried to escape and go t o other farms, just to get awa y from t he lines.

at, or Œ or able to escape and get back to the lines. 

Q: You sai d a lot of men died during the death march. What did Œ what happened to 

them? What did you do with them if they Œ  
A: We couldn™t do anyt hing because the Germ ans wouldn™t let us do anything at  all. 

Bury them, or whatever, they wouldn™t let  us do nothing, unless we were Œ 
we were 

stationed in one spot, either the y Œ they would let us 
[indecipherable]
 or pull them 

over, and leave them ri ght there, in the spot. Otherwise, the y woul dn™t let us do 

anyt hing t o bury t hem. Unless we were in a camp, like we were in the  barracks.  

Q: Right, right. And so, do you know how many days you were marching? Do you 

remember?

A: Whe
-When we were li Œ we wound up in t his big barn, and that was the end of it. 

We got out there, and Œ and it was awesome, because when we got in there, we 

were welcome by the owners, and the y brought us food and all that. But, to sleep, 

we had to sleep in t he Œ on the slush of the ani mal s. And Œ but we were able to eat

some of the bread, the bread was black bread, the good bread. And Œ and then 
suddenly, very early in the morning, the German commander Œ well, we all heard 

the firing in the distance, thundering. So, we heard that there were tanks 

approaching, and we don™t Œ we didn™t know whether the y were Americans, or 

French, or English, whatever. Or Russians. B ut the Germans started to feel the Œ the 
heat, and so the y wanted us to follow th
em
. And so the y push Œ they pulled the Œ the 
rifles against us, and pointed at us, and sa ys, w-we Œ either we go, or Œ with them, 
or the y™ll shoot us. That™s what they wanted to do. So, as I yelled back at them, and 

the other medic, I mean, we™re medics, and we™re t-taking care of these men, and 

they™re dying. One just  died Œ or t wo just  died just a Œ a while ago. So, how can we 

go, and Œ they can™t  walk any more. So, before you knew it, the y too escaped, and 

th-the guards turn i n our Œ gave us our rifles. And he says, we™ll sta y with you. And 
we started to hear the rumbling getting cl oser, and th Œ 
we 
Œ we al l st arted to run 
towards the highwa y, and when we got to the highwa y, t he tanks were the 11
th
 
armored division, liberating us.  

Q: Going back just a little bit; when you were on the death march, did you know Œ 

have any sense of what was going on with the war around you, as far as how close 

the allies were getting, or any news that you were receiving, now t hat you weren™t  

in the camp?

A: We ni Œ we didn™t even know what was goi ng on until  we found out that the ger 
Œ the Ameri cans were making a big sweep. And when the y saw us, they thought 

that we were enemies, and that we were camouflaged, and we didn™t have the Œ 

Q: When the 11
th
 armored division found you. 
A: The 11
th
 armored di vision saw that Œ when the y saw that we were Americans, 
and we spoke Engli sh very well, t hen Œ then they welcomed us, and one of them 

pulled me like a Œ like a beet, string beet. Pulled me up on top of the tank, and then 

I ju Œ just sighed with relief that we are in their hands. And as we were running 

towards the Œ the tanks, some fellas started to fall down dead, because of the 

excitement, and because of the weakness.  

Q: What was it like to see that white star on that tank, to know that they were 

Americans?  
A: We were so excited, we Œ we cri ed. We cri ed, we Œ we Œ we had t he Œ 
we were 
so excited t hat we coul dn™t s-sa y any more

on the top of the tank, one of the fellas said, look, there™s a girl 
with a

young girl, oh, probabl y i n her 20s, and she had a jug of milk. And he said, well, 

let™s get that milk for Œ for you guys, and so you can drink. And he was not aware, 

and we felt hungry, and we started drinki ng it. Well, Lord behold, it made us sick. 

My stomach went like t his. We weren™t far away from the Œ from the place of the gi

Œ that first night that you were in a real 

bed, in this hospit al, after liberation? 

A: I thought I was float ing in water, because of the fact that it Œ it Œ I slept on Œ on Œ 

on-on the ground, and slept on the rocks, the snow. Y-You just freeze to death. And 
sleeping on a bed, you just fall Œ totally fall asleep. I remember still t he Œ

I had Œ I had m y ot her f Œ m y whole family here, on this side. 

Q: And how did your family on t his side of the border treat you? 

A: Much, much wonderful. Even though they were half Œ half cousins and half 

aunts, and half everyt hing, but to me the y were full. 
Q: And did you say anything to t hem about any of your experiences? 
A: Oh, the y felt bad, they felt very bad. And yet, how was I to know yet Œ the 

traumas, we go back Œ that I still had that stigma in me, to go back to 
Durango
 and 
Œ and tell m y mother, and yet see my father, face him agai n, after I tol d him I don™t 

want to see hi m again, that I was going to get married to Œ to the girl I met on the

Q: Œ and Œ and how did you feel, you Œ your pra Œ your parents before Œ and we™re

everything t hat you went through, and then you have your father turn his back on 
you, and call you a coward, and how did Œ how did you feel about everything? You 

had gone through t his experience in the 
POW
 camp, and then you were in 
Berga
. 

And it was your father who encouraged you to go back to the 
United States
 
and to 

serve in the army. So how Œ how are you feeli ng at this point, about everything that 
you™ve gone through? 
A: I Œ I Œ I put a blank in front of me. I decided then, not to let that bother me. 

Because I had other conflicts that was disturbing me, and that was the emotions and 

the stress, what I went t hrough when I was a 
POW
. And then, what hit me worse 

afterwards, I kept that, the stigma that he said to me, that I was a coward. I kept t hat 

behind me, andI 
Œ 
and I 
couldn™t get it out  of Œ 
Q: And how did you deal with that  for the rest of Œ 
A: Yeah. It st Œ it still bothers me, because you never see a father tell  t hat to his son, 
unless he feels like he i sn™t proud of anything. 

Q: And how did your friends, your old friends who you knew back in school, and in 

California
, did you see them again after you returned, and how did t hey treat you? 
A: Yeah, I Œ I Œ I recei ved my friends and Œ and then the y treated me very well. The 
Œ and their conditions were very Œ they Œ mucho Œ mutually, totally complete, 

different. Not like when I told m y father, I says, what do you call  this, being a

coward, is it Œ but I™ll t ell you one thing, what makes a person is that Œ because he 
would tell me about 
Pancho Villa
, and Œ and Œ and the bi g, tall heroes. I sa ys, you 

know what , that powder that the y burn in 
Mexico
 is no comparison to the powder of 
a woman™s powder that  she puts on her face. B ecause our powder in our gu Œ 

weapons, can burn up your heart before you can sa y a word. That™s what I told him.

Q: And did you Œ so, di d you get al ong wi th your father at that poi nt? 
A: I didn™t seem to get to know my father very well, because in the first place Œ I 

don™t think that he was very much a father. I hate to say it , but I feel t hat, with an 

expression of 
Œ of feeling, because I remember when I was still i n Œ i n dur Œ in

a lot of young fellows l ike to get i nto bars. I said, what makes you thi nk that I 

would la Œ rather get into a bar? And he didn™t  like the answer, or the question. And 

then, so he changed his mi nd, and trying t o finagle me into somet hing else. And 

then he took out some pictures, and he sa ys, see? And he showed me three children. 
He says, well, he sa ys, I want to do awa y with you and your sister. What makes you 
think that Œ that

And with hi m was the director, and m y father was with hi m. And they were coming 
over to Œ and my father, to apologize to me. By that ti me I had that Œ I didn™t hav

this way, as a survi vor, as a Holocaust survivor, when you think of this? 

A: It™s an honor. It™s a pleasure to be in Œ part of it, because I feel that what the y 
went through, m y respect to all those people, children and mothers and fathers. 
Q: When 
Œ when peopl e started to talk about what the y had gone through in the 
Holocaust, did 
Œ did that encourage you to begin to speak publicly? 
A: Your emotions get t o where you want t o say a lot, but  you can™t cover a lot of 

territory. You wish you™d cover a lot of territory, and yet, i t Œ it Œ it ties a knot in 

your throat.  

Q: And what Œ as Œ as a Latino, what would you like Lati nos to understand about 
this experience, about your experi
ence?
 
A: Some are hard to understand, but some stress out and Œ and to the surprise, they 
remain blah. They Œ 
they di 
Œ don™t understand why it happened, why this, why 
that. Now, that™s what you c-call, i t takes a coward to do things that you weren™t  

supposed to do. 

Q: And so, when you l ook at this Œ this large group, this large ethnic group, 

minority group here in the

should the y learn about the Holocaust, Lati nos, as much as it™s part of Jewish 
history? 

A: Yes, the y should. 

Q: Why?
 
A: The y must learn t-to be able to l ove more, to understand, and be able to get al ong 
with each other, and respect each ot her, and respect others. 
Q: Do the y ever Œ has it ever been your experience where they think it won™t 

happen to t hem, because the y™re not Jewish, or Œ 

A: No. It could happen. 

Q: So, wit h that, t oda y, you™ve Œ you™ve come to the museum, and you are donati ng

donating t hem to the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

includes your diary. 
A: Yes. 

Q: What does this diary mean to you? 

A: It was a part of m y l ife. A few words with it, it™s part of my life.

William Shapiro
, whi ch he died this Christmas, past Christmas, of cancer. 

Otherwise, he would have been with us, in this group. 

Q: So, by giving us these very personal bel ongings, and this bei ng the nation™s 
memorial, to tell this hi story, what  do you hope others, particularly younger 
audiences, what do you hope that they will  understand when they learn about your 

diary, and when the y learn about what you™ve given 
the museum?
 What do you 
want them to understand, through the Œ this donation? 

A: One i mportant thing is this able to Œ to get i nto their hearts, and their minds, t hat 

feeling of Œ that the y would think that it sounded impossi ble, but the i mpossible 

came true to life, and able to understand, and penetrate int o their minds, what reality 
did exist. Because some of them do not understand yet. And thi s they ha Œ 
something hasto get 
Œ be i mplemented int o their lives, so it would penetrate. 
Otherwise, it would be a blah, not understanding what it is exactly. 

Q: And there™s Œ there™s something that a soldier, an ethos of a soldier at war, and Œ

fallen comrade. So, what do those words mean to you toda y, over 60 years, after all 
you™ve been through? 

A: That penetrates, cause it™s the truth. It™s Œ it ™s more than a prayer. And hope t o 

under Œ everyone will be able to understand t he meaning of it. 

Q: And with that Œ wit h those words, and Œ and your comrades, when you Œ when 
you have talked to other survivors throughout the years, do you feel t hat bond with 
the other 
Berga
 survivors? And how do you describe that bond, if you feel it? 

A: I fe Œ these words, so hard words, that mean a lot. It i s a feeling of Œ 
it means a 

lot, really. It™s penetrating. I hope that people would understand t hat. 

Q: You Œ you and others who were i mprisoned at ber Œ in 
Berga
, you were denied 

full disability. You mentioned that only for si x months, you received 150 dollars, 

and then it stopped. And the 
US Army 
would not publicly acknowledge what 
happened to you. Can you put int o words what that meant  to you, what that means 

to you now? What that meant to you then, and now? 

A: Well, that Œ to me, I got to where a lot of us fellas, buddies, when I read this t o Œ 

mat erial, we all came out with the expression of Œ we memori Œ murmured it. It  was 

Œ the expression that, how stupid Œ and pardon the expression Œ  

Q: It™s oka y.

A: Œ of using it that way. If not, there™s another word for it, and that t here must not 
have been no feelings at all, to thi nk that the 
United States
 gave all those people, 

all those soldiers t o be out there, and gave t hei r lives, for other lives j ust to survive, 

families. There must not be no feeling. Why they have that audacity, that yet it 

doesn™t penetrate int o t heir minds, the feelings of what other people have, a life. 
And yet, some go to church and pra y, and t he y turn around and slap you in the face. 
And yet, the Œ no respect. And here, one the Œ instead of giving t he 150, here, 

beca
use you served your country. It™s a laugh. Like, lot of people said, we don™t  
expectthe money. We res 
Œ we expect dignity, and Œ and the true fact  of Œ the 
feeling of Œ of love. Not double tal k.

Q2: 
Tony
, you just spoke so eloquently just now, of what it felt like when your 
country turned its back on you, and told you that you coul dn™t talk about what you™d 
been through, and denied you the benefits. And yet, you fly your flag, the American 
flag, and the 
POW
 flag every day from your home. Can you talk a litt le bit about  

that sort of feeling of Œ of Œ there must be something in t here that Œ that sa ys, on 

some level, there™s a love for this country, even so. Otherwise, I don™t know that 

you™d be flying that flag. Can you talk a li ttle bit about that? 

A: It™s very hard to express m yself for that respect, but I fly the flag of the 
POWs
, 

because the t hought of what™s remaining, and what™s gone. The gone is, God took

them. The American flag is due to respect, and the digni ty of the 
Uni ted States
,  
remains a love. But  yet, you woul d think that there™s still somethi ng way back over 

there, that t he y™re tryi ng to almost i mplement a law that t here™s no such thing as in 

God we trust, or nothing like that. Which I think it™s nothing but a bunch of double 

talk that they™re tryi ng to do, to i mplement. We™re trying t o f Œ it is the fact, give 
our countries more strength. If the people would open up and be more dignified, to 
mai ntain the firmness, t hen we™d show we respect that flag as the st rength of the 

country. And in God we trust. We love. And He protect us, which they don™t 

believe in t hat, but the y™re a bunch of atheists.  

Q2: Toda y you™re givi ng, as 
Christina
 said, a set of your most preci ous documents, 

that talked about what you went through, to the Holocaust  Museu
m. What made 
you decide to make thi s donation to this institution? 
A: What make medeci deto 
Œ to do that? 
Q: Yes. 
A: I Œ it™s a wonderful t hing to Œ t o find out that finall y there is a pl ace where Œ 

there™s a resting place, dignified, the respect of what all these young people, old 

people, disappeared, wi thout necessity, with no reason at all. It was horrible, and I 

think the y deserve at least something, a piece of m y life.

Q2: Very soon, the generation that served duri ng that ti me, both in the s Œ the 
forces, and also were i n the camps, and suffered under the Œ the hand of the Nazis, 

will pass from being a living hist ory, to being something in records. What would 

you hope that anyone, young, old, anyone coming to this museum, seeing your life 

on displa y, what are some of the things you™d like people to take away, about this 
history, and your part in it? 
A: I Œ it™s hard to explain. You could sa y it in many words, but you Œ there could be 

one word. With all dignity, I do respect the li ves of what was missing. At least to 

remember those of the past and present, which were remaining, of that life that 

existed. And we pra y for them, too. But the courses Œ the life of theirs, that remains. 

I do Œ do it with a very dignified manner, and love. That was a very words in it, but 

that means a lot.
