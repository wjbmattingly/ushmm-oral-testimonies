Henr y left Germ any through a Kindertrans por t, a r es c ue effor t that br ought thous ands of J ewis h

Des k  and is now being inter viewed by mus eum vis itor s.  He als o s peak s  about his  
Holoc aust 
experienc e at local high s c hools  and c olleges .  Henr y is  fluent in Englis h and Germ an.  He walks 
r egular ly, tends to his  in
-
door  gar den of exotic  plants , reads a lot, and s pends  time with fam ily and 
fr iends .
 
 
With that I would like you to join me
 
in welc oming our Fir st Per s on, Henr y Kahn. 
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, welc om e and thank  you for being willing to be our
 
Firs t Pers on
 
today.  You 
have an extr aor dinary am ount to s hare with us  and we have little time s o we'll s tar t right away if you 
don't m ind.
 
 
You wer e 10 year s  old when Hitler and the Nazis  c am e to power in 1933.  Befor e we turn to 
the war and the Holoc aus t, tell us a little bit about your  family, your c ommunity, and your  life in 

Germ any befor e that period.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Well, thank  you, fir s t of all.  Thank  you all for c om ing.
 
 
To start off with, I'll tell you, our
 
r elations hip in the population. We lived in Boblingen, as you 
hear d.  My par ents  were very fr iendly with another couple.  The hus band was  the owner  of a toy 

fac tor y.  And m y brother  and I, we had a lot of benefits  fr om that fac t.  My par ents went skiing with 

them, tennis .  So it was  a normal life.
 
 
In 1932
 
--
 
well, in 1930, we m oved to Stuttgart.  The r eas on, num ber one, m y father's  job now 
was  pr es ident of the c attle dealer s  as s oc iation.  The offic e was  in Stuttgar t, whic h was  about eight 
m iles , 10
 
m iles , from where Boblingen was  s o he had to c omm ute.  And
 
the other  r eason was  that I 
was  s uppos ed to go to the s c hool whos e ideas  at that time were very, ver y  moder n.  For  instanc e, in 
the fir s t grade boys  and gir ls  learned how to knit and to s ew and c r os s  hook .  We listened to two 

3 
 
languages , English and Frenc h. We had a mixed c las s .  So it was  entirely different fr om  the German 
public  s c hool s ys tem.
 
 
As  tim e went on, we m oved to Stuttgart, as I m entioned before.  The last teac her whom  I 
had
 
--
 
the nam e, Karl Hager, we will c om e ac ros s his  name a little later . 
 
As  I s aid, the s c hool was  
unique as far as  the public  s c hool s ys tem  was  c onc er ned.  And by the time Hitler  c ame to power  in 

1933, that didn't quite jive with their philos ophy.
 
 
As  you know, November
 
9, 1939, was Kr is tallnac ht.  In the m eantime, we had m oved to
 
C
ologne bec aus e when Hitler  c am e to power  in 1933
.  S
om e Nazis  walked into his offic e and told him  
you're out and that was  all there was  to it.  He c ouldn't do a thing about it.  He c ouldn't c all the polic e.  
He c ouldn't c all anybody.  The Nazis  wer e
 
the ones  who were in power.  My father thr ew the keys  on 
the floor
 
--
 t
hat's  what he told m e
 
--
 a
nd walked out.
  
They went thr ough his  books and tried des perately 
to find s om ething that had been at fault, that he had m ade a mis take or that he had c heated in any way.  

I s ay now unfortunately they didn't find a m is take bec aus e they let him go c ompletely.  He felt s ur e that 
having
 
--
 
[Inaudible] in the Fir s t World War, he would be abs olutely s afe.  He was  deadly wrong.
 
 
1939 was  Kr is tallnac ht.
 
> > Bill Bens on:
  
Henr y, before you tur n to Kristallnac ht, c an I ask you a c ouple of other questions ?
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Of c ours e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When your father  lost his  job and walked out, what did he do to s uppor t the fam ily after 

that? 
 
>>
 
Henr y Kahn:  Fir st of all, he took  over  a stor e of c lothes  whic h he tried to s ell.  He went to at that 
tim e Palestine to s ee what the poss ibilities  wer e.  When he c ame back, he s aid if we live in Germ any 
the way we have to live in Pales tine at that tim e, we'll las t a long time.  As it turned out, he was  literally 
dead wr ong. 
 
 
Then we m oved to 
Cologne
 
wher e m y father took  over a ply wood dealers hip.  That was  
another m istake.  My mother was  ver y m uc h oppos ed to all of thes e m ovements bec aus e s he s aid let's  

get out but m y father was  adamant.  He wouldn't even bother  to r egis ter  us  for anything.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  mother , as  you s aid, wanted to em igrate.  She tr ied to pr epar e you for 

em igr ation.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  She prepared hers elf ver y m uc h.  She lear ned how to s ew, how to m ake s hir ts , how to 
s ew ties , and c andies .  She was  ver y m uc h pr epar ed to get out of Germ any but m y father  wouldn't do 
it.  And at that time women weren't as  liberated as  they are today.  So c ons equently they just did what 
the hus band
 
s aid.  Regardles s  of how they felt about it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You
 
--
 
Henr y, you lear ned to blow glas s  and make neon tubes .  Tell us  about that.  
That bec omes s ignific ant for  you later in life.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yeah.  It bec am e s ignific ant.  Everything we lear ned was  s ignific ant, believe me.  I 
learned how to blow glass for  neon tubes .  That
 
--
 
m y mother ar ranged s omebody in the building while 
we lived in Cologne.  Any way, I went to the J ewis h sc hool now bec aus e in 1930
 
--
 
in 1938
 
--
 
in 1935 
J ewis h kids  were
n't allowed to go to the Ger man sc hool.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It's on.  It's not her e.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Is  that all r ight now?  Can you hear ?  I c an s peak m uc h louder.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ther e you go.  All right, Henr y! 
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Let's  do that until it c omes  back on. 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yes.  I was  in Cologne.  I went to a J ewis h s c hool.  Bec aus e ther e was  one in 

Cologne.  The non
-
J ewis h s c hools  wouldn't allow anym or e J ewis h to c ome in.  The Jewis h wer e 
c om pletely s egregated.  It was  terr ible.
 
 K
r is tallnac ht happened.  My father  was  arr ested.  Two guys  c ame the next day.  That was  the 
9th of Novem ber.  It was  Fr iday. 
 
 
Is  that better?  Yes ?  Ok.  Can you hear me now? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It's not wor king. 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Hear ing is  not im por tant.  Unders tanding what I s ay is .

>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> 
Exc us e me.  We're going to s witc h real quick.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Ok.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bear with us, folks. 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Why go eas y when it's poss ible to go har d.  Right? 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  So, as
 
I s aid, the s c hool
 
--
 
the Jewis h wer e not allowed to lear n in the public  s c hool, in 
the Christian s c hool.  They had
 
--
 
they were not allowed to go to s c hool at all unles s  you had a J ewis h 
s c hool you c ould go to.  Cologne had a J ewis h s chool.  That's where
 
I went to.
  
In addition to 
ever ything els e, in 1938, the philos ophy of theWaldorf sc hool didn't jive with the Nazis  s o c ons equently 
the fac ulty was  dis mis s ed. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, a ques tion for you.  You'r e going to tell us later , Mr .
 
--
 
>> Henr y Ka
hn:  Of c ours e.  I m entioned him befor e.  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e roughed up at sc hool.  Tell us about the inc ident when you wer e r oughed up 
at s chool.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  No.  It comes  after wards .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Ok .  Keep going. 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Ok.  So when m y father was  in the c onc entr ation c am p, he c hanged his mind.  By 
then, of c ours e, it was  too late.
  
After he cam e bac k , we got a telegr am  fr om m y c ous in who was  
working in London.  He had a gir lfr iend whos e father  was  the owner  of a c lothing factory.  And the 

nam e was  London, Mr . and Mrs . London.  And Mr .
 
London was  kind enough to s pons or me.  So I was  
able to go with the Kinder trans port to England.  England was  the only c ountry in the world whi
c h 
allowed unac c om panied c hildr en between the ages  of 3 and 17, before 17, to c om e pr ovided they had 

s pons ors.
 
 
Well, two weeks after  m y 16th bir thday
 
--
 
anybody  here 16 year s  old?  Quite a few.  Now, jus t 
imagine two weeks  after  m y 16th birthday m y parents  and I went to the railroad s tation and we s aid 

goodbye to eac h other .  And I k new pos itively I'm going 
to 
s ee them again.  My parents left the 
platform .  A few m inutes  later  they had found out that the tr ain was  delayed by half an hour and a few 

m inutes 
later they c ame bac k .  The mom ent I s aw them c ome back, I knew this  is  it.  This is  the s ec ond 
tim e I s ee them and that was  the las t time I s aw.  So c an you imagine if you s ee your parents  for the 

las t time and you'r e 16 years  old?  It's  pr etty hard on you.  But als o on the parents
 
I c an as s ure you.  
And I'm s ure your  par ents  will vouc h for that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, I'm  going to take you back  for a c ouple of m inutes if I c an.  You m entioned 

when your  father c ame out of the c onc entration camp.  Tell us a
 
little bit about Kr istallnac ht. What 
happened to your fam ily dur ing Kris tallnac ht whic h led to him going into the c onc entr ation c amp? 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Well, the way I per s onally experienc ed it was  a friend of mine who was  older  than I 

was , worked for a b
aker
, h
e cam e in and s aid, "Don't go to sc hool."  Bec aus e there was  a lot of trouble.  
The s c hool wher e I went to was  next to a s ynagogue.  The s ynagogue was  attac hed to other buildings.  

So c ons equently it wouldn't be burned but it was  rans acked.  There wer e people thrown out of the 
window.  Of c our se, died.  Ther e was an awful lot of upheaval.
 
 
Personally, I was  fortunate.  I didn't exper ienc e too muc h m ys elf.  But ever ybody els e did.  
And being J ewis h I was n't able to go to the m ovies  or the s wimm ing pool or anything els e.  It jus t was  
terr ible. 
 
 
All r ight.  Getting back
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  A c ouple m or e questions .  Your father was  arr ested.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Oh, yeah.  On the next morning, while we wer e s itting in the living room, two guys  
c am e, not in unifor m, c am e to the door.  I opened the door.  They s aid, "Is  your father in?"  I s aid, 
"Yes ."  He c ame out.  They ar r es ted him.  And when he went with the guys  to the polic e s tation he 

as ked
,  
"What would you have done if I hadn't been hom e?"  "Oh, I would 
have gone to the neighbor's  

5 
 
who is  also J ewis h to c over  our obligations ."  In other words , they had a sc hedule how many people 
they have to ar r est.  And that's all ther e was  to it.  Nothing to do with anything they had done that was  
wr ong anyway exc ept the
 
tr ouble was they were Jewis h. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So Henry, as  a res ult of him being im pr is oned in the c oncentr ation c am p, c oming out, 

that's  when your par ents m ade the dec is ion when they heard about the Kinder tr ans port to send you 
England.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  
Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you tell us about getting to England, you des cribed going to the tr ain station and 

leav ing.  You told me an inc ident about a gir l with a news paper  as  you cr oss ed the border .
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yeah.  In the train
 
--
 
this is very a
m us ing.  It's  ver y gripping, too.  After  we c ros sed the 
Germ an bor der, got into Holland, ther e was  a little girl who had an illus tr ated paper.  After s he was  s ure 

that s he was  in Holland, s he took  a pic tur e of Hitler  which was  in the paper  and tor e it into
 
a thous and 
piec es
.  J
us t to give you an idea of the em otions  whic h was  ther e at that par tic ular tim e.
 
 
Well, we got
 
--
 
it was  the 2nd of Februar y
 
1939.  We got into England.  A s hip took  us  acr os s 
the c hannel.  We got into Liver pool.  Ther e we wer e taken into a big hall.  Everybody had a tag with a 

num ber on it.
 
 
I knew a little Englis h bec aus e I had learned a little bit.  A
nd a
 
lady walked in who looked nic e 
to me.  I walked up to her  and s aid, "Can I help you?"  I don't know whether I s aid it this  way bu
t 

s om ething like that:  She pulled out a piec e of paper  and read m y nam e.  I s aid, 
ﬁW
ell, that's me.
ﬂ
  
So I 
had m et m y s pons or.
 
 
We went to their  hom e, whic h was  on Hamps tead Gar den Suburb.  They had one fam ily 
hom e.  On the s ec ond floor  ther e wer e three bedr oom s.  I had one bedroom  to m ys elf
, w
hic h was 
extremely nic e.  And then I had to learn how to eat the Englis h way.
 
 
Now, you know, in order to eat
 
peas in Amer ic a, you us e the r ight fork and you eat peas.  In 
Germ any you eat it with your  left hand bec aus e you us e the k nife on the right hand and pus h it on.  But 

in England it's differ ent still.  You have to poke the peas  with a fork . 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>
>  Henry Kahn:  Very few peas get into your  mouth at one tim e.  But that's  the way it is .  That I had to 
learn first.
 
 
Shor tly ther e
after, he asked
, ﬁD
o you want to go to s c hool or  do you want to go to work?
ﬂ
  
So I 
gave it a little thought.  I s aid, well, I
 
have to wor k  bec aus e, A, I had no money at all, zilc h, and, two, I 
wanted to learn s omething s o when I get to the United States , whic h I always  had in the back  of my 

m ind, whic h I wanted to do, I wanted to have s om e s or t of a tr ade that I could get m ys elf
 
employed in 
s om ething.  So I s aid I'd like to work.
 
 
Well, that was  well and good.  I gues s Mr.
 
London got m e a lear ner 's  perm it or whatever it is, 
an appr entic e perm it.  And every m orning he took  m e to work.  And every afternoon or evening he took 
m e home in a c ar whic h was  very nic e.  I had lunc h with the staff.  But I was  pr actic ally in a glorified 
pr is on bec aus e there was  no plac e to go, no public  tr ans portation anywhere near it.  In any c ase, I had 

no m oney.  So I went for walks .  Ther e was  a Ham
p
s tea
d over  ther e, a beautiful m eadow.  I onc e in a 
while laid down and dream t. 
 
 
This  was  ok .  That was  all r ight.  Now, this was  probably the end of Febr uar y or  the beginning 
of Mar c h.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you got to England, Henr y, were you in touc h with your  parents still?  Were you 
able
 
--
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Oh, yes.  I s till wr ote to them.  That's obvious .  But that had to stop pr etty s oon.  On 
September
 
1, war brok e out and that was  the end of any c omm unic ation with my parents.  That was  it.  
So war broke o
ut.  And Mr .
 
London told m e, well
 
--
 
oh, befor e I
 
--
 
after a while I was  working in a 
pac king
 
--
 
in a package plac e, packing room .  I lear ned how to m ake knots  and how to put tags  on 
pants.  Now, that's  no profes s ion, I tell you.  And I didn't think I c ould earn any money doing that.  So I 

as ked Mr.
 
London to let me pleas e work  in the s ewing r oom and lear n how to do that.  Oh, this  was  

6 
 
unacceptable.  The pr odigy of the fac tory owner working with the c omm on women?  That's  ridic ulous .  
Any way, the ans wer  was  
negative. 
 
 
Well, the war br oke out.  And Mr.
 
London told m e they were going to evac uate.  So the fam ily 
evac uated.  And he s aid
 
to m e:  W
ell, s inc e you are wor king, you have to look  for  a plac e to stay.  Well, 
I did that.  And I found a plac e in Fins bury 
Park , whic h was  not as  fanc y as  Ham
pstead G
arden but it 
was  nic e.  I m et s ome people ac ros s the street whom I got very fr iendly with until today.  The fellow 

pas s ed away a s hort while ago. 
 
 
So now I was  mor e or les s  free.  I was n't in the pris on anymore. 
 
So the firs t thing I did was  
as ked Mr.
 
London
 
--
 
initially he had
 
--
 
I'm s orr y I have to s ay that.  He s aid, no, that's  ok .  You c an't get 
a pound a week.  That's  ok .  So now that I was  on m y own, I s aid to him , 
ﬁC
an I have s ome m or e 
m oney?
ﬂ
  
He s aid, "No
, you c an't.  Other kids  at your  age don't get any
 
m or e money either."  I s aid, 
"Well, other kids  m y age us ually s tay with their par ents and they don't have to be on their own."  "No, 
you c an't have it."  Now I s aid to him, "Now I want to wor k  in the s ewin
g room."  This  time he didn't have 
the ner ve to s ay no.  Becaus e I jus t had to do it. 
 
 
Well, I lear ned how to s ew.  I was  told you don't k now how to s ew pr oper ly until you put one of 
the s ewing needles into your  finger .  That never happened to m e s o I guess I never lear ned it pr oper ly.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  I still only got a pound.  So I dec ided to go
 
--
 
after I knew a little bit how to s ew, I 
dec ided to go in piec e work.  In other words , get paid by the piec e whic h I manufac tur ed.  So I 
r eque
s ted it.  I was  granted.  And then all of a s udden I c ould get m or e.  Quite a bit m or e.  In fact, in the 
end I got as  m uc h as 30 s hillings  whic h is  half a
s 
m uc h as  a pound.  That was  helpful. 
 
 
So now I worked there.  Then 1940 c ame.  In May
 
1940, the Germ
ans  invaded Holland, 
Belgium  and eventually Fr anc e.  And the Br itis h Expeditionar y Forc e had gone to help the Frenc h.  
Well, the Fr enc h gave up pr etty s oon.  The Br itis h Expeditionar y For c e, as many as  they c ould, they 
c am e to Dunkirk, a por t on the north of Fr anc e, and they wer e
 
--
 
m any wer e at the c hannel.  300,000 of 
the s oldier s, of the Br itish Expeditionary For c e and the free Fr enc h wer e able to be evac uated by small 

par ty boats fr om  Dunkirk .  
 
 
Of c ours e, all whic h had been taken overs eas  was  lost.  And Br itain was  really in bad s hape.  
They didn't only get s c ared.  They bec am e panicky.  And they dec ided, well, everybody that they 
learned about, in Nor way , and they dec ided ever ybody who c am e from Germ any is  actually an enem y 
alien by hear t or other wis e.  Now I was  ins tead of an enem y of Nazi oppres s ion, I bec ame an enemy 
alien.  A lot had to be 
inter n
ed.  As I s aid, the Br itis h got s c ar ed.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, the s tatus as  an enem y alien, before that you had had offic ial papers  s aying 
that you wer e a r efugee from Nazi oppres s ion.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yeah.  I just m entioned that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I wanted ever ybody in the audience to mak e s ure they under s tood that.  So you wer e 
officially a refugee fr om Nazi oppr ession but then when they got
 
panicky, they
 
dec ided you wer e an 
enem y alien and you had to be inter ned.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yes.  Exac tly.  So now I was  s uppos ed to be interned.  Ever ybody
 
--
 
m y fr iends, they 
had gone
 
--
 
the friend acr os s  the s tr eet from where I lived, they had gone to Amer ic a in the meantime.  
So they weren't affec ted by it.  But I was .  But not im mediately.
 
 
When I notic ed that people like m ys elf, whom I'm aware of, wer e being interned, I dec ided I'll 
take all of my money to the organization, the Bloomsbury Hous e, the organization in 
c har ge of the 
Kindertr ans por t.  I did that.  I took the m oney over  there and told them
:  L
ook , this  is  the m oney I have; 
get m e out as fas t as pos s ible and get m e a ticket to get to the United States .  They s aid
:  W
ell, this is 
not quite enough but they wer e s urpr is ed I had ac c um ulated that m uch funds
; h
owever, we'll make up 
the differ enc e.  Great. 
 
 
Ok.  Then I asked Mr .
 
London to give m e a c ertificate to tell them that I was  working ther e and 
all of that.  Eventually I s aid, look, I need it today.  So they wer e a little tak en aback.  But they gave it to 
m e.  The day I got it, when I c ame hom e, the land lady told me
 
--
 
by the way, I paid 12 s hillings  and six 
pence a week .  So I got one pound and 12 s hillings and s ix penc e.  This  is  m uc h more than half. 
 

7 
 
I w
as  asked
 
--
 
c ame and told me to c ome to the station next door, to the polic e s tation, the next day 
with all of my c lothes.  Well, I went ther e.  And that was  the 3r d of J uly.  On the 3r d of J uly I was  
interned.  
 
 
That night we s tayed s om ewher e over  ther e,
 
a rac e c ours e I think.  Slept ther e.  Then we 
were taken the next day with a piec e of c hees e, whic h was  our  pr o
vis ion
 
for the whole day to Liverpool.  
Liver pool is  a por t on the West Coast of England.  And there we wer e told, after  we ar rived, that the 
sh
ip that had taken pris oner s  of war  and inter nees  to Canada had been torpedoes  and s unk  and many 
people had dr own.  We were told Liverpool had been bom bed the week before. 
 
After that we were 
as ked, "Who wants  to volunteer  to go to an over s eas  dominion?"  
 
 
Well, I gave it to thought and dec ided that I'll take a c hanc e with an overs eas  dom inion 
bec aus e the c hanc es  of being tor pedoed and hit was  lim ited as  far  as  time was  c onc er ned.  You don't 

know if the Germans c om e to England. We were in a tent c am p.  So ther e c ould be m ac hine guns  or 
whatever .  I dec ided to take a c hance.
 
 
Well, s even days  after I was  inter ned, on the 10th of J uly, with 2,500 other  people I boar ded 
the Duner a, the HMT Duner a, her majesty's  cruis e s hip, Dunera.  And we got aboard.
 
 
And now
 
I'm going to quote you s om ething that
 
--
 
to s how you how s c ar y and prec ar ious  a 
s ituation it was , how Mr .
 
Churc hill expres s ed it in his  m emoir s .  J us t a s hort notation.  How m uc h the 
U-
Boat warfare reduc e our im por ts and s hipping.  No fear  for great ges tu
res  and.  Only the s low 
dr awing of lines  and c harts  whic h s howed pr etentious  s trangulation.  The high in fac e s pirit of the 
people c ounted for not.  And this  bleak  domain, the food, s upplies , and arm s  fr om the new world and 
the empire arr ived ac r oss  the oc eans or they failed.  The los s es inflic ted on our m erc hant s hipping 
bec am e most s ever e during the 12 months from July
 
10
 
--
 
fr om J uly
 
1940 until J uly
 
1941 when we 
c ould c laim that the British battle of the Atlantic  had been won. 
 
 
This  was  Mr .
 
Chur c hill.  
Well, we wer e aboar d the s hip.  Our luggage was  put on top of the 
dec k , put on one pile.  A c anvas  was  put over  it.  I was as s igned to the bottom  deck .  In the back  of the 
s hip. 
  
So now ever y other  day
 
--
 
no.  Fir st we had to
 
--
 
it was  pr etty c r owded to p
ut it m ildly.  The s hip 
was  built to ac c omm odate 1,500 people, 1,500 s oldiers  and we wer e 2,500.  So you c an im agine.  

There were hooks on the c eilings .  So I figur ed they mus t be for hamm ock s .  Sur e enough.  So 

eventually we got ham moc k s .  I got a hammock.  I was sur e to get a hamm ock .  When I was  s winging 
happily bac k  and for th on the hamm ock  whic h was  gr eat.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ther e wer e 2,500 of you on that s hip, I believe, but not all of them  wer e in your 

s ituation. Weren't there Germ an pris oners ?
 
>> He
nry Kahn:  Pr is oner s  of war.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Mingled with you.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  No.  They wer e s eparated.  There weren't that many.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  They wer e m os tly J ewis h people fr om Germ any and from  Austria.
 
 
Well, we lifted anc hor that s am e night.  And the next m or ning
 
--
 
yeah, the next m orning a 
torpedo hit the s hip, made a dent into it but did not explode.
 
 
Now, fast for war d 22 years  later.  My family cons is ted of two s ons  and m y wife and m ys elf.  I 
met Mr.
 
Karl
 
Hager. R
emember the name I m entioned befor e?  I m et him  in New Yor k .  He told us after 
having met him s everal tim es
, ﬁ Y
ou know, after we wer e dis mis s ed in 1938, I had to look for a job and I 
got a job in a torpedo factor y.  And onc e in a while I put s and into the torpedo.
ﬂ  
So, you s ee, I pr obably 
owe m y life to him or s om ebody like him. 
 
 
Getting back  to the Dunera.  Every morning when the weather perm itted and we wer e not in 
the har bor, we wer e allowed to run ar ound the dec k
.  T
he c r ew whic h guarded us
 
--
 
of c ours e, they 
w
er e not the cr eam of the c r op of the Br itis h Army.  One of them had glass  eyes .  So there were 
dr unk
ar ds, limping, God knows  what.  They wer e c r iminals , bas ic ally.  Bec aus e when we got to the 
dec k , we notic ed that the 
c
anvas  had been pulled off of the luggage. We didn't get the luggage.  The 
c anvas  had been pulled off.  And m any s uitc as es had been opened.  As I found out later, a lot of stuff 

8 
 
was  thr own over boar d, stuff they s aid they didn't want.  Of c ours e they helped thems elves  to what they 
liked.
 
 
Well
, it s o happens, although this  was  a c rim inal ac t
 
--
 
the c om mander  of the cr ew was 
eventually c ourt m artialed after the war .  However , as  muc h as  this  was  a bad thing to do
,  
it may have 
s aved our lives  bec aus e as  we found out
 
--
 
well, several year s  later  when I went to Stuttgart again, I 
found out that one of the U
-
Boats whic h had followed us , the c aptain was  c urious  what we had thr own 
over boar d and what he pic ked up was  am ong other  things Germ an letters .  And then he r ealized that 
ther e m ust be German pr isoner s  of war on there.  And c ons equently he didn't s hoot his  tor pedo.  So 
that's  the s ec ond time we wer e luc ky.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And Henr y, I think  you believe that's when you los t all of your family letters . 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Oh, yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They were thrown over boar d.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, did you know what your  des tination was ?  Did you know where your des tination 
was  s uppos ed to be?
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  No.  Over s eas  dom inion.  I didn't even know what a dom inion was  never  
m ind
 
--
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  So we went ar ound the Cape of Good Hope.  The r eas on we knew it is  bec aus e we 

weren't allowed to go on dec k  while we were in the har bor  to refurbis h
 
but we looked through the 
por t
hole of the toilet.  That's the only way we c ould look .  And ever yone had a c hanc e to look for about 
a m inute.  And while I was  looking thr ough that, I s aw a huge c loud c om e over.  It looked like
 
--
 
the s un 
was  s hining agains t it, lik e a gold table cloth going over .  It was  fantastic .  I s till
 
r em em ber that view.
 
 
Any way, after  we had gotten new pr ovis ions , we left.  And after  two months  of tr avel we finally 
landed.  It tur ned out to be Sydney, Aus tr alia.  We wer e taken off the boat, all of us.  Some of us  wer e 
s ent
 
--
 
we wer e sent s om eplac e els e.  18 hours  into the inter ior .  The tr ain was going quite s low.  As  
you looked out of the window, ther e were kangar oos  tr ying to rac e us .  But ther e was  no c ontes t, of 

c our se. 
  
After 18 hours we ar rived in a br and new camp, newly built.  The s and was  blowing ver y  hard.  
It was  a des ert, bas ic ally .  It was  c alled Hay.  I don't know.  We m ust have gotten s om ething to eat.  I 
went to a bunk.  I went to s leep.  We were tir ed. 
 
 
The next m or ning, out of 2,500 people who were aboard the s hip, 13, 1
-
3, 13 nam es
 
were 
c alled out and m ine was  fir s t one on the lis t.  And we wer e told to go back to the or derly room.  Then 
we wer e told to get our luggage
 a
nd go over  to the offic e
r
s, back  to the r ailr oad station.  One of the 13 
of us overheard one o
f the guys  s ay "Thes
e c haps ar e going back  to England." Well, I didn't ask  for it, 
but that's  what s om ebody over hear d. 
 
 
So we went bac k  to Sydney.  We got back  to the boat.  But the boat was n't ready to s ail yet s o 
we wer e taken to a pr is on that had a s pec ial s ec tion for  in
ter nees.  There was  an Italian guy who got 

the paper  ever y day. We looked at the paper .  Lo and behold, east London, wher e the fac tor y was  
wher e I us ed to work , was  in flam es , c om pletely in flam es .  So I really had no appetite to go back  ther e.  

But as I s aid, I was n't asked. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You told m e that when you got bac k  on the Duner a, that was  fir st tim e that you 

per s onally felt really s c ared. 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yeah, yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That was  the firs t time you felt r eally s c ar ed.
 
> > Henr y Kah
n:  Yes.  Well, the reas on I got s c ared was  bec aus e the firs t time that we got to the 

Duner a, we were put into the bunker and locked up.  And I thought, my God, if we leave, there is  no 

c hance of m e s ur viv ing anything.  You wer e c aught like a rat.  But then they br ought us som ething to 
eat and I felt better . 
 
 
Any way.  We wer e in that internment c amp in Sydney.  After that, after 10 days , we wer e 
taken back  to the ship.  The s hip left the har bor.  We got to Perth, on the West Coas t of Aus tr alia.  And 
ther e 
we had the cr ew load half pigs, pigs cut in half and frozen.  So we had them  loaded.  And then we 
took off again. 
 

9 
 
 
Now, after two weeks  the s hip stopped.  Now, it took  us  two months  to c ome her e.  Two 
weeks  c an't be again.  As  it is, we were taken off the
 
s hip.  The plac e was n't very fam iliar.  The people 
were kind of dark skinned.  Ther e wer e lots  of r ed s pots on the s tr eet.  That's all I notic ed at the time.  I 
had no idea wher e I was .
 
 
We wer e tak en to the polic e s tation.  And ever ybody was  inter viewed.
  
The fellow who 
interviewed m e s aid
 
--
 
asked me all s orts of s illy ques tions .  Then he s aid, "Wher e do you live?"  I said, 
ﬁ
I don't even know where I am and you ask  m e where I live?
ﬂ
  
So it tur ns out he had to ask .  It tur ns out 
it was  the J ewis h Relief A
s
s ociation Hom e in Bom bay, India.
  
So, wa
-
la, I got to India.
  
I was  told after 
the inter view that I have to repor t twic e a week to the polic e s tation but other wis e I was  fr ee to move 
ar ound in Bombay c ity
 b
ut don't leave the is land.  Bombay is  an is land.
 
Well, that's how my s tay in 
India s tar ted.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Two ques tions  for you.  Do you k now why you wer e one of the 13 s elec ted to return to 

England and then why they left you in Bom bay, India?
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yes.  You s ee, fr om the 7th to the 10
th
 - -  
fr om  the 3r d to the 10th is  seven days .  At 
that tim e ther e was  no inter net
 a
nd c ommunic ation was  r elatively s low.  So s inc e I had r equested to be 
r eleas ed in or der to be sent over to the s tates , the r eleas e hadn't c om e thr ough.  But it ac tually had 
c om e
 
through on the 10th but I was  already on the s hip or going on the s hip or whatever.  So that's the 
r eas on that I was  r eleased.  I didn't know that until way, way later .  So that's  the reas on I was  one of the 
13. 
 
Any way, I got to India this  way.  I did all s orts of things over  ther e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Why did they leave you in India
 w
hen they wer e going to take you to England? 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Well, I'll tell you, they wer en't s uppos ed to tak e us to England.  They were s upposed 
to take us  off the s hip bec aus e ther e was  a tr oop s hip and the troop s hip was  s uppos ed to take tr oops  
to the Middle Eas t to fight. We wer e s uperfluous of that s hip, of c ourse.  That's why we wer e taken off 

the s hip.  That's  it. 
 
> > B ill
 
Bens on:  And left in Bombay,
 
India.
 
>> Henr y Ka
hn:  That's r ight.  That's how we got to Bombay.
 
 
Any way, I worked at s ever al jobs. What's  the time?  I worked in sever al jobs .  I have to hurr y 
up.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  I wor ked in s everal jobs
 
in
 
Bombay.  Fir st I didn't get
 
--
 
fir s t I wanted to lear n 
s om ething but that was  no good, as  a dental mechanic .  And a dental m echanic  s hop I was  wor king but 

the bos s didn't want to teac h me anything.  I only learned s om ething when the guy was  away.  And 
that's  wher e I us ed m y glas s blowing exper ienc e, to m ake s aliva injec tors .  We s old a few but there was  

no deal.  It was  nothing muc h.  How m any s aliva injec tors  do people us e? 
 
 
So then I got another  job.  I got a job as  a book keeper and s ales m an.  It was  a s o
-
c alled 
c ons ulting engineer  of
fice.
  
Of c ours e, while I was  in London, I had gone to the ac c ounting s c hool at 
night while I was  living in Liver pool and lear ning how to do s om e book keeping, whic h was  kind of 

diffic ult for me bec aus e wher eas  all the other people in the c las s  wer e guys  who wor ked in an offic e, I 

worked in a factory.
  
And another thing, Englis h pounds , s hillings, and penc e was  differ ent.  It had to be 
c onverted from  one to the other .  Thes e days  it's  eas ier bec aus e you have a hundred s hillings for  

pound now.  So I lear ned t
his . 
 
S o I got a jo
b with them.  B
efor e I started I bought 
m ys elf a little booklet 
on bookkeeping and I r eviewed.  So that was  easy.  Then I did s om e s elling s tuff like that, s o it was  

eas y, too. 
 
> > Bill B ens on: Wil
l you tell us  about your friend 
--
 
I th
ink  his  nam e was  Eric  Lynn
 
--
 
who c ontac ted 
your  parents ?
 

> > Henr y Kahn:  Yeah.  Go back  again to 
`
35.  I was  in the kinder home in a plac e that was  like a 
c am p.  I met this  fellow.  We were very good fr iends .  We bec am e ver y c los e.  I met him again in 

England.  And he was  in the United States .  Som ebody left for the United States as  I arrived in India.
  
I 
as ked him to leave a mes s age to Eric.  What he did was  s omething wonderful.  I didn't ask him for it but 

he imm ediately wrote a letter  to m y parents  that I was  all r ight bec aus e they had looked for  m e.  They 

hadn't known what had happened to m e.  So that was  great.  So he did that. 
 

10
 
 
 
I was  fr iendly with him  and his  wife, the whole fam ily.  We were very friendly until his  wife 
pas s ed and he pas s ed away not long ago.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  If I r emem ber c orrec tly, onc e the U.S. dec lar ed war on Germany and J apan
 
after Pear l 
Har bor, that was  the las t tim e any c omm unic ation c ould happen with your  par ents.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Oh, of cours e.  Anyway, I was  in India
.
  
So I worked for the Indian Tool Com pany 
whic h made s tuff for  the war  effort.  I was , of all things , night
 
s hift s upervis or.  I was  all of 18, 19 
year s
 
--
 
18 year s old.  But I was  qualified.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the little tim e that we have left, there's  a c ouple other things I want you to tell us 
about.  One of them  is meeting your  futur e wife.  I want you to tell us  about, in the time we have left, tell 
us  about meeting your futur e wife and then about going to the United States. 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  All right.  I'll tell you.  I had c om e back
 
--
 
inc identally, I was  in [Indis c er nible] for  seven 
m onths, had a job down ther e.  The interesting thing about this is  at that tim e, the way m ilk was  

deliver ed, I was  living with a fam ily, Haim y.  Every  m orning the m ilk  was  delivered to the hous e
 b
ut not 
in a bottle, not in a c an but by the c ow.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  The c ow c am e of c ours e with a m an.  He had s everal 
pales  
in his  hand.  He m ilked 
the c ow in front of us.  I don't know if ther e was  any water in it or not.  He gave it to us .  That's  the way 
it was .
 
 
Any way, when I c ame bac k  from  Bombay
 
--
 
fr om Madras , a f
r iend of m ine told me to go to the 
Mac c abi one night
, t
he Mac c abi Spor ts  Club, a Jewis h spor ts  c lub in Bombay.  And there they played 
ping

pong.  And I played ping

s he won m os t of the gam es .  Mos t, not all but mos t.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  So I had to 
a
venge m ys elf.  So what do you think I did?  Two years  later I married her.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, you wer e in India, as it turns  out, until 1946, I believe.
 
> > Henr y Kah
n:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Then you were able, finally
,  
to make it to the United States .
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about c om ing to the United States .  And Doreen, your  future wife, didn't c ome 

with you.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Ok.  In 
`
46 I was  able to buy a ticket.  I had enough money
 
--
 
the m oney whic h I had 
given to the Blooms bur y Hous e was  sent to me, whic h was  good, and I had ac c umulated a little mor e
, 

n
ot muc h mor e bec aus e I didn't really m ake m uc h m oney but it was  enough to pay a ticket.
  
When I 
had asked to get a booking, I was  told I have to get a
 
c ot to s leep on.  Well, I didn't have enough money 
to buy a c ot so I bought a hammock .
 
 
In Mar c h of 1946, I finally was  able to get too wher e the s hip left fr om.  It was
 
--
 
oh, it does n't 
m att
er r ight now.  There was  a vic tory s hip.  And a vic tor y s hip had jus t been built but it hadn't been 
c om pleted.  So there was  the c r ew hous e in the bac k  whic h was  jus t an empty room, built in s teel.  
There was  nothing in it.  So that's why they wanted to
 
--
 
s o now I had a hamm ock . What am I going to 
do with that?  The way I s olved it is  I c onnected it to the s c rew on the window and the hinge on the 

door .  So like this .  So I was swinging back and for th while everybody els e was  s liding back  and for th in 
thei
r cots.  [Laughter]
 
 
I had no m oney left.  $10 I had left by the time I was  finis hed with everything.  And when we 
finally got to the United States, to c am p New J er sey, I had nothing.  I had
 
$10.  But I had m oney lent to 
m e, given to m e to give to the br ot
her of my fr iend.  Whic h fortunately was  good. We landed.  I had a 
hairc ut, firs t of all.  I needed badly. 
 
Being a gr een hor n, the bar ber took  full advantage of me.  He 
c harged m e
 
$2 for the hair c ut whic h at that tim e was  50 or  60 c ents . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:
  
20% of your  money. 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  [Laughter ] In addition to whic h I had given 50% of the m oney as  a tip to the guy who 

was  on the s hip, feeded us  all the tim e, fed us  all the time. 
 

11
 
 
 
So any way, I had the
 
$50 whic h was  good.  I had c ontacted my c ous in in Verm ont who told 
m e that I had a c ous in in New York .  I c ontac ted her.  She was  very s ur pr is ed to hear fr om me becaus e 
s he had no idea that
 
--
 
I gave her a c all.  I was  at the station.  She told m e to c om e.  She told me to 
take the s ubway.  Not the Metro, the s ubway there.  And I went ther e.
 
 
She was  m arr ied.  She had a little boy.  I was  s leeping
 
--
 
s he asked m e to s tay with her, whic h 
was  good bec aus e I had no plac e to go anyway.  So I s tayed with her for a c ouple of days .  After a day 
or  s o the hus band
 
s ays
:  W
ell, 
you have to look for a job.  I
 
s aid
:  W
ell, I am in a way.
  
What I did was  I 
vis ited fr iends  and asked them whether they knew anybody in the im por t/expor t bus ines s .  I had 

br ought s andals  with me from  India and c onnec tions .  So I figur ed I m i
ght get into the import/expor t 
bus ines s . 
 
 
So one of them knew s om ebody in the Em pire State Building.  I m ade an appointment with the 
gentleman.  Sur e enough after I pr es ented m y c redentials
 
--
 
[Laughter ] 
--
 
he s aid, well, ok, you c an 
head the new far eas t
 
depar tm ent and you get
 
$30 a week .  And I had a sec retar y.  So we started 
wr iting letters.  In addition to whic h I would get a quar ter of a perc ent of all the pr ofits whic h ar e being 
m ade after each tr ans action has  been c ompleted.
 
 
Well, that was  Apr il.  
In September I was  drafted.  So at that time m ail didn't go ver y fas t.  It 
took two weeks  for a letter to be returned fr om India or  Indones ia or wher ever  it was .  That delayed any 

tr ans action. 
 
Well, anyway, s o I c ouldn't get any c om mis s ion at this  point. 
 
However , when I c ame out of 
the Arm y, s ix m onths and 13 days  later  and I went back  to the offic e, I was  given a c heck  for c los e 
to
 
$1,000 for the c omm iss ion whic h I had earned.
 
 
Now, as  far as Doreen was  c oncer ned.  Doreen was  bor n in India of J ewis h par e
nts , 
European back ground.  As  s uc h, there was  no quota for J ewis h
 
--
 
for people bor n in India to c ome to 
the United States , none.  Well, while I was  in unifor m I went to the State Depar tm ent and I s poke to 
s om ebody over  ther e.  I s aid, "How c an I get m y 
fi
anc ée
 
to c om e here."  It was n't a 
fianc ée
 
then.  I had 
a c onditional arr angement with her if and when we m eet again and feel the s ame way about it as we do 

now, we will get m arr ied.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Ok.  So now I went to the State Departm ent,
 
told them, look , I'm neither an Am er ic an 
c itizen nor  am I married
 s
o I r eally have no legal right but I knew fr om the Arm y that if things c an be 
done offic ially, they c an be done unoffic ially.  So in other words , I s ay
 
--
 
I said to her , look, s ee what you 
c an do.  She s aid, yes , I will. 
 

 
Well, it tur ned out that after a while m y wife, who wor ked in a s ection in Bom bay whic h her 
office was  acr oss  the s treet from  the Americ an Cons ulate, s he got a c all said c om e over.  She w
ent 
over .  She s aid, 
ﬁD
o s till want to go to the United States ?
ﬂ
  
She s ays  yes .  So s he went back .  The next 
day s he got another  c all
, p
leas e c om e over .  
ﬁ
When do you want to leave?
ﬂ  
Her  affidavit had expir ed, 
but that's  ok .  Everything all of a s udden wo
r ked.  On J une
 
9, 1938, s he arrived at La Guardia airport.  
And on the 27th we bec ame hus band and wife. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And Henry, you told m e that dur ing that time that two year s  alm os t you were apar t
 
--
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Oh, yes.  Dur ing that time we were in c omm unic ata.  We wr ote 117 letters, eac h bac k  

and for th.  Our  last one was  num ber 117.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Her last one was  from  India, May
 
1948
, 
before s he arr ived.
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'r e getting c los e to our time to end.
 
>> Henr y
 
Kahn:  I know. 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, when did you lear n about what happened to your par ents ? 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Oh, I learned that after the war  was  over, of c our s e.  I don't know how.  I m ay have 
hear d it through
 
--
 
in Is rael or  som e othe
r  way.  
 
 
My father, he was  killed.  My parents had taken
 
--
 
been taken to Lodz in Poland in 1941.  My 
father got s ick , ill.  And, of c our s e, as it was  ther e, he died there.  My mother  s ur vived
, a
s I  
found out 
very rec ently
. T
her e's  no r ec or d of her  at all.  But I know s he s ur vived until 
`
44.  People were dr iven 

12
 
 
bac k
 
--
 
driven, not in c ars  or trucks but they wer e walking back to Germ any.  But before they got to 
Germ any, they were s till in Poland, they wer e for ced to dig ditc hes and then they were s hot.  And
 
I'm 
pr etty s ure m y m other's fate was  s omething like that.  It's  very likely. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Henr y, did any other  family member s  s urvive? 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  No.  I have an aunt, an unc le, and a c ous in in Hamburg who didn't s urvive.  The older 
daughter, s h
e is
 
--
 
s he was  in Isr ael.  She died in the m eantime.  I'm  in touc h with her  family ther e, yes .  
But otherwis e whoever  was  left in Germ any that I was  c onnec ted to, they didn't s ur vive.
 
 
When I got back  to Germany about three year s ago with my s ons , I went to the Waldorf sc hool 
and I talked to the gr oup over  there, to about, I don't know, a room full of people.  They wer e inter es ted 
in m y s tor y.  I asked were there any survivor s  fr om  m y class .  They all had pass ed away.  So I was  the 
only s urvivor mys elf. 
 
>
>  Bill Bens on: We'r e at the end of our time alm os t.  I'm  going to turn back  to Henr y in jus t a c ouple of 
m inutes
 
--
 
m om ents to c lose our pr ogr am.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being with us .  I r em ind you we will have
 
Firs t Per s on
 
pr ogr am s 
eac h Wednes da
y and Thur s day until the m iddle of Augus t.  We hope that you'll have a c hanc e to c om e 

bac k  or look ahead to 2016 if that's pos sible.
 
 
It's  our  tr adition that our
 
Firs t Pers on
 
does  have the las t wor d.  He's  going to get the las t word.  
And you didn't get a c hanc e to ask  him  ques tions.  So when Henr y finis hes , he's  going to r emain up 

her e on the s tage when he's  done.  So when we finis h, pleas e feel fr ee
, 
if you want to c ome on up after  
the progr am, ask  a question of Henry or just s hake his  hand or get your  photo taken with him, whatever 

would like to do.  Pleas e know you're ver y welc om e to do that. 
 
 
When Henry finis hes, I'm als o
 
--
 
I would als o like to ask you
 
to
 
stand bec aus e our 
photogr apher , J oel, over her e is  going to come up on the stage, take a photo of
 
Henry with you as  the 
bac k gr ound.  That just makes a wonderful photogr aph for him  of this  pr ogram.
 
 
On that note, Henr y? 
 
> > Henr y Kahn:  Ok.  I want to leave one thought with you.  If ever  you have ver y good r eas on to dis like 
or  even hate som ebody, an individual per s on, do not generalize and do not as s um e that ever ybody  
els e of the s ame back ground is  the s am e.  Be discriminating and be fair bec aus e you know there are 

always  good people among bad ones.  Like in Germ any, like Mr.
 
Hager  or other people who r
isk their  
lives .  And s ome of them who were c aught got actually killed.  So this  is  what I would like you to 

r em em ber.  Don't gener alize as  far  as the c har ac ter of one partic ular per s on is  c onc erned. 
 
 
Thank  you ver y m uc h.
