Question: I'd like you to start by 
just telling me  your name , where you were born, and the date of 
your birth, please. 
 Answer: My name  is Jack Ahrens. I was bor
n in Lida, which was Poland at the time of 
my birth, and I was born, born July 26, 1921. 
Q.  Tell me  a little bit about your
 boyhood in Lida, what it was like. 
A. I grew up in a norma l fa mily. My -- I was th
e only child. My father was an engineer who 
owned, together with my  mother's uncle, 
a foundry which used to ma ke agricultural 
equipment like plows, which were horse-pu
lled. Very primitive, to comp are what's going 
on now. We  lived next to the 
factory, and I used to visit 
it, and I guess that's  what 
installed my love for engineering, because my
 fat her was an engineer. Unfortunately, he 
died in 1932. I was 10 and half 
years old at the time. Three y
ears later, I think, my mother 
remarried. She remarried an American. She came,
 she and -- to the States. She was in the 
states until 1938. I was brought up 
by my grandparents. Li ved t
ogether with my aunt and 
uncle and finished the gimnazjum
1
 -- that is the Polish high
 school -- with the last 
graduating class, in 1939. My mother neve
r became an American citizen because of 

involveme nt in properties in Poland, but she 
came to visit h-- us 
in 1938, and when the 
war broke out, she got stuck. She had papers 
which would allow her to reenter the United 
States, but she was not a citizen. After graduating high school, my grandfather, who 

happened to be one of the wealthiest Jews in
 our little town of Lida -- was a town of 
                     
1
 Grammar school (Polish).

approxima tely 30,000 people, out of which 
between 10 and 15,000 were Jewish. He was 
one of the wealthier me n. He had, he had conn
ections, of course. He knew a lot of other 
people, and he knew some one who was connected
 with -- to the crea
tor of modern Poland 
in 19-- in 1918, Ma
rshal Pilsudski.  
 
01:04:10 

 

 The reason why I'm me ntioning 
it is because for Jews to en
ter a school of higher learni ng 
was extremely difficult. They were -- ther
e were quotas, and you had to be extremely 
brilliant  in or der to be admitted within th
e quota. But he was told that if I pass the 
entrance exam for the Polytechni c Institute of
 Warsaw, I would be admitted, as long as I 
pass it. So, in 1939 in August, I went to Wa
rsaw to study with the Union of Jewish 

Students of the Polytechnic Institute of Wa rsaw
 -- sort of preparatory course prior to the 
exam; and that's when I saw the posters of m
obilization that -- and 
the war broke out at 
that time. That was when Hitler attacked Po
land, on September 1st, 1939. That night of 
September 1st, I was on the last train from Wa
rsaw traveling to Lida, after I had left all 
my possessions in Wa rsaw. I just -- I was glad
 to get out. The train, the train trip that 
norma lly took 12 hours, took pro-- about 24 hour
s. We were bombed along the way, but 
we did ma ke  Lida, and when I got home , 
I got scolded: Why did I leave all my 
possessions in Wa rsaw?  I said, ﬁI just coul
dn't carry it.ﬂ I mean, that's how people 

trivialized the war. They didn't think that
 things will happen. We didn't realize what 
actually is going to happen. We  were at hom
e wa tching -- listening 
to the radio, watching 
Poland, the Polish army collapse -- not from 
the broadcasts, the Polish broadcasts, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311

from broadcasts from abroad because the Poles di dn't want to admit. They thought their 
cavalry, their horses, would actually overcom
e the German tanks. Fortunately for us, 
Stalin and the Russian Army -- and the Red Ar my, came in fr om the east, went towards 

the west and they divi ded Poland and that tim
e. Hitler and Stalin, they divided Poland 
and fortunate for us, my town, Lida, was in 
the Russian territory, in the Russian area. 
 

01:07:10 

 

Q. Ok, before you continue, I want to ask you a couple questions. 

A. Sure. 

Q. When you left Wa rsaw, you had the -- a sens
e that you had to get out and get back to 
your fa mily?  What was going on? 
A. They were mobilizing just about everybody, ex
cept not 18 year-olds. I was 18 at the time. 
I think anyone -- I, I don't  
re me mber. Anyone who was in the army prior to that: the 
reservists, plus anyone who was over 20, I think;
 they had to report to the nearest army 
post. I was not included, but -- I ju
st didn't want to be separate
d from the fa mily. I sort of 
realized that Poland had no chance against 
Germany, against Hitler after the way he 
showed -- after his show of force in Czechoslovakia and Austria. 
Q. So you already had a fairly str
ong awareness of Hitler and Nazism? 

A. Yes, definitely. I did belong to the -- prio
r to the war, I did be
long to a group, to the 
Zionist movement, and I was an admirer at th
at time  of Ze™ev Jabotinsky, which is a -- I 

did belong to the Betar also.  
Q:  And then, just going back a little further to
 the town and the community in Lida, before 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
4 
 
we go on, I'd love it for you to tell me a little
 bit more about what 
life was like before the 
war, and whether you experienced antisemitism, whether you mi ngled with the Christ ian 
people in the town -- what, 
what, what it was like. 
A.
 
Jews usually did not mi ngle with 
the, with the Christians. In 
going to school -- there were 
two high schools in our town, one actually cl
osed after that. There was a pr ivat e high 
school and a high school which was run by the State. The State high school was the 

privileged school and there™s -- there was a quot
a with the, with the 
State High -- with the 
State gi mnazjum. Not all the Jews that wanted were allowed to go ther e. By strange 

coincidence, the other high school was a pr
ivate high school; however the ma jority of 
Jews, Jewish children, went to a sc
hool which was called the handlówka.
2
 That was a 
commerce school where you were prepared for accounting, for bookkeeping, so 

some thing like that. And that school was run by a order of, of Cath-- Catholic priests. But 

Jews were accepted there. There was no quota 
in that school. Because I wa s one of the 
few who was accepted to the high school, to th
e Catholic High -- to the State hi gh school 
from the very beginning -- and in Pola
nd we had eight years of high school.  
 
01:10:46 
 
B.
 
Later, during my time, t hey changed it. It 
was six years of high sc
hool and two years of 
lyceum. It was like the last 
two years of high school, they 
changed it. They called it 

lyceum. The  quota was sort of rescinded and 
ma ny, ma ny more Jews were allowed into 
this, into this high school. We
 for me d a very close circle 
of friends, none of us were non-
Jewish -- strictly by religion. If
 Jewish girls were out with
 a Christian boy, it happened -- 
                     
2
 Commercial sc
hool (Polish).

the opposite happened very, very seldom. It mo
re often that the Je
wish girls were out 
with Christian boys, it wa s sort of like a black
 ma rk on their record. It was held against 
them. But we did ma ke friends. In school
 we were quite friendly. However, like 
everywhere, the high school kids were -- the Ch
ristian high school kids 
-- were in, in the 

front of ideas. So when Marshal Pilsudski
 died in 1935, and the reactionary, the real 
chauvinistic -- I forgot the ma n, the ma n™s 
na me , took over, there was one of the few 
pogroms in Lida. The pogrom consisted basica
lly of not killing people, but destroying 
property. There were some  broken windows. Th
ere were some  broken s t ores, and ma ybe 

a few Jews were beat up, but 
no one got killed. No one was to
rtured. It was more or less 
you had to stay off the street because you knew if they catch you, you were going to ge t a 

beating. That lasted a day or two and then 
it was forgotten, and we
 were good friends all 
over again.  
Q:  Did you personally -- 
 
01:13:00 

 

A: It was sort of, it was sort of directed by 
the governme nt. They were told, ﬁYou have to do 
it.ﬂ Sorry. What was your question?   
Q. I™m sorry. Did you personally ever get beat 
up, or people say things 
to you, or experience 
any of this? 
A. Oh, I was told ma ny things. I was told, 
but never physically. I never had any physical 
harm, but I saw them breaking windows 
and walking around with what you would 
describe now as a baseball bat. Actually we 
didn't  play any baseball, they were just

sticks. Hitting Jewish businesses, becaus
e most of the downtown Lida was Jewish 
businesses. I would say probably 95 percent or
 mo re of the businesses in town were 
Jewish, Jewish-owned. The Poles were mostly farmers. It's strange but ma ny times on, on 
some  occasions we were told by our friends, ﬂWatch out. Don't go out this evening 

because there will be like a rumble.ﬂ We we
re friendly with them. So, you stood home, 
and that's it. It™s -- the division was strictly 
on a religious basis, a
nd in opposite to what 
you have in here as far as Jews, are concer
ned, you had the Hasidim, the real Orthodox, 
and the traditional, what you would descri
be here. But still me n and wome n were 
separated, or they were on different -- they 
were usually on different 
fl oors in the, in the 
synagogue. The wome n were upstairs, the me n 
were downstairs. But there was no such a 
thing as modern Judaism, the Reform Judaism.
 It didn't exist in, in
 our town at all. 
Q. What about your fa mily? 

A. My grandfather, who basically raised me  
with my grandmother, they were I would say 
Orthodox, but not Hasidim. They observed 
all the holidays. Th
ey did everything 
according to the good book, but they were not what I would say in their dr ess and their 

behavior, they were mo dern. But I did have an
 uncle who ma rried my grandfather's sister 
-- it™s not my uncle, my mother's uncle -- who was a hosed.
3
 In fact, I became  quite 
acquainted with the, with the Hasidim, because I said Kaddish
4
 for my fat her for 11 
months after he died, and the only one that w
ould go to -- that went to temple three times 
a day was my mother's uncle.

 So, I used to go to his te
mple, to his Hasidishe shtibl,
5
 to say Kaddish for my father. And 
that™s what I, more or less, I got acquainte
d with the Hasidim. It
™s not that I -- I did 
admi re them for their staunch behavior, for th
eir staunch belief, for 
the way they behaved 
in spite of all the adve rsity, because  the town was -- didn't exactly admi re them, because 

they, they we re different. See, the Jews in Pola
nd from what  I -- at least in my town, tried 
to more or less assimilate. They didn't  try to 
separate themselves. They tried to live like 
the other people. In fact, they lived better th
an the other people. They were more Polish 
than the Poles themselves. Now, I reme mber that in my parent's home  -- because  my 

father came from Russia; my mother met him 
when my -- her parents, my grandparents, 
ran away from Lida. They were in Lida for 
several generations, but they ran away from 
Lida in the first World War. Lida was a bat
tlefield, so they ended up in a town called 
Tsarizin in the -- in Russia. Tsarizin wa
s known by another name , Stalingrad, during the 
second World Wa r. They lived there for a fe
w years, and they me t my father, who was 
from Khar™kov in the Ukraine, which is now 
Ukraine. At that time it was all Russia. My 
father ma rried my mother. He was 10 or 11 y
ears older than her, but she was a beautiful 
girl, and they -- he came  together with his in
-laws to Lida. They built
 that factory I have 
me ntioned. I used to go there with him, watch 
them pour mol t en iron into for ms, and they 
liked me , I think, the people that worked for him, they liked me  because Œ they, they, they 

liked me even later. But after he died, a
nd my mother rema rried, the factory sort of 
reverted to the rest of the 
fa mily. It was my uncle that
 was running it, and, and my 
mother's uncle actually paid my mother o
ff, and he had that factory. He took it over. 
Q.
 
[Technical conversation] Ok–so when the 
Russians took over your town in 1939, what

did that me a n?  What sort of changes took place? 
 
01:19:25 

 

A.
 
When the Russians came in 1939, the change-- th
e changes were ma jor. First of all, the 
Russian classified everybody in ma ny ways
. The first classifica
tion was: were you a 
working ma n, or were you a capitalist, or 
so-called ﬁbourgeois.ﬂ Second, they also, on 
your passport which they gave you, besides yoursocial status, if you were a working ma n 

or not, they listed your religi
on. I had a friend whose father 
was the chief engineer of a 
rubber factory in our town. Our -- the town 
of Lida was quite i
ndustrial. It had two 
foundries. It had a factory that produced nail
s used for construction, and a factory that 
produced rubber; usually they produced -- what ™s the English?  Galoshe-- Galoshen (ph). 

What™s that? Rubber, rubber boots.  
A:  Galoshes. 

Q: Galoshes. The chief engineer of that fact
ory, his son, we went to school together, we 
were the best of friends. So when the Ru
ssians came  in, and they na-- of course 
imme diately they nationalized all the factories,
 but they left the chief engi neer in charge, 
because, after all, he was a working ma n. He 
gave me  a job. He gave my mother a job. 
So, I was able to get a passport which stated 
that I was a student working, but the Jew, the 
ﬁEvrei,ﬂ
6
 remained on the passport. My mother wa
s able to get a passport that she was 
working -- ﬁRabochiy,ﬂ
7
 but still Jew. All the, the rest 
of the family got passports that 
they were capitalists, and they were ba nned from Lida, because  Lida was too close to the

border. You had to be at least a hundred kilome
ters from the border. 
Lida was closer than 
a hundred kilome ters, so they were banned and 
my grandparents had to move into a small 
-- very, very small town. It's not even a to
wn, it's -- was a settleme nt, whatever you want 
to call it. More inland, more fa
ther away from the border.  
 
01:22:05 

 

 In the meantime, my mot her's younger sister -- 
she had two sisters. That would have been 
the mi ddle sister. She was ma rried to an e
ngineer, a chemical engineer, whose brother 
was an electrical engineer. They built in Li da
 a little factory which ma de rubber heals. 
Prior to that , he gained these experience by 
building factories. He built -- he was -- he 
built a factory in Spain. He built a factory in Gr
eece, and my aunt was traveling with him. 
He spent, spent a few years in each pl ace because he could not find work in Lida -- or  in 
Poland, actually. Then he decided he and his 
brother build a factory where -- that was 
ma king rubber heals. Wh en the Russians came i
n, they of course nationalized the factory, 
and they had to run away. So him and his brot
her and the brother's fa mily went to Vilna. 
When the Russians came in, they gave Lit
huania a short-lived independence. The border 
was not closed imme diately, so you could travel 
actually to Vilna. My aunt, my mother's 
sister, rema ined in Lida to 
liquidate her possessions. She was selling everything off. She 
sold everything, and she decided to cross the bo
rder illegally with so
me other people that 
I knew, and they got caught by the, by th
e Russians. The trial was imme di ate. The 
sentence was imme diate. They were sent to
 Siberia to Kazakhstan, bani shed there. We  
knew all that. There is a reas
on why I am me ntioning that. Th
at™s part of my general 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
10 
 
experience. Also, we had a cousi
n. It's not, not my cousin, it's 
my mother's cousin. It™s all 
-- but I still call him a cousin, who was a docto
r, and being, being a doctor, being of draft 
age, he and his brother, both of them were
 drafted into the Polis
h Army. The brother, 
being just an accountant, was a private. The doctor, because he  was a doctor, became an 
officer. They were -- they became pri-- Russian pr isoners of war. The private escaped, 

and he survived in a different way. But the docto
r, eventually he perished in Katyn, in the 
ma ss graves when 10,000 Polish officers were killed by the Russians on St alin's orders. 

But his wife and daughter were arrested, se
ntenced imme diately, and sent to Si-- to 
Siberia, also, also to Kazakhstan. That's  
where my  aunt me t both of them. The reason 
why I am mentioning it is when we decided 
-- when we ended up in Lvov -- I'm jumping 
again.  
 

01:25:42 
 
 When we -- when my mother and I got 
the good passports, I still wanted to go to 
Polytechnic Institute, but the nearest Poly
technic was in Lvov, which was 600 kilome ters 
south of Lida, approxima tely. 
That was too far to leave th
e  fa mi l y ,  s o  my  c o mp r o mi s e  
was to study physics at the University of Vilna. 
I went to Vilna, and I tried to enroll there. 
However, they closed the border between 
Lida and -- between Russia -- between the 
Soviet Union and Lithuania, and travel woul
d have been impossible. So, I came back to 
Lida, and I think it was already March of 
1940, we decided with my mother to go and 
settle in Lvov. Now the -- when the Russian
s came  into Lida, be
side nationalizing the 
factories, they requisi tioned all the ho mes.
 They requisitioned all 
the living quarters. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
11 
 
lived with my grandparents a
nd with my mother. They ha
d a big house and they had a 
sort of an apartment in the 
back, and we lived in that apar tment with my mother. They 
chased everybody out. They limit -- gave us, I th
ink, two or three room
s, and that was for 
seven people. In the beginning, we had a Ru
ssian colonel -- a Russian general -- living 
with us. But that was sort of
, more or less -- I became  fr
iendly with, with some  Russian, 
with some  Russian airmen. We  used to indul
ge in vodka together, Have gefilte fish on a 
Friday with vodka. We  became friends. I was 
doing nothing at the time, except working 
occasionally in the rubber factor
y to ma intain my  status that
 I am still a working man, but 
my goal was to get out and go to Lvov.  
 
[Technical conversation] 

01:28:20 

 
 When we left -- and this is rather important
 -- when we left Lida and went for Lvov, we 
didn't realize how crowded Lvov 
was. All the refugees, mostly
 Jews that escaped Hitler 
from Wa rsaw and Kraków, ca me  to Lvov. Lvov 
at that time  had a Jewish community of 
over 150,000. The population of Lvov actually mo
re than doubled with the refugees 
because of the war. Finding living quarters was absolutely impossible. So, when we 
came, we started to look and look, and even
tually we found an apartment with a Polish 
fa mily. It was an older Pole. He was at that
 time in his 60s. He had a -- with his wife. 
They lived on the outskirts of Lvov. He was 
like a general contractor. He was, I'd would 
say, about a kilometer from the last stop of the 
streetcar, and that Pole actually played a 
major part, an extremely major part in my life. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
12 
 
Q: Ok. 
 

02:01:12 

 

Q. Ok, you™ve arrived in Lvov, and I want you to
 tell me  some thing about the life there in 
the community, and, and I know it was an impor
tant city, so what was your life like? 
A. It was a big city. We  found an apartment,
 which was an extremely i mportant thing with 
the -- this Polish family: Czachor; his name  was Jan, her name  was Marja. They were 

both elder Poles. I had a lot of conversations
 with him because on the beginning my main 
aim was to enroll into the Poly
technic institute of Lvov, whic
h actually didn't -- that was 
April, and school wouldn't  start fo
r at least five months or more. 
Q. This is in what year? 

A. 1940. So, I was actually doing -- I was doi
ng nothing. My mother found a job. She was 
working. Every job with the Russians was fo
r the governme nt. There was no such a thing 
as private employme nt. We had to -- we 
had some saved up money, of c ourse, because 
they could have -- they confiscated the prope
rty, but they did not take away, the Russians 

didn't take away the tangible goods: the monies
, the gold, the, the, th
e silver, the jewelry, 
whatever it was. So that was still negotiabl e. 
Q. Yourmother'shusband? 

A. My mother's  husband was in the United States. She didn't know at the time, because she 
could not get in touch with him, but he die
d. He died while she was in -- I don't recall 
exactly, he died in '40 or '41, or some thi
ng like it. But there was no, no possibility of 
getting in touch. It was very difficult. We
 were, we were still looking for another 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
13 
 
apartment, and we found a place be cause we 
were so far out of town. We  found a place 
on Wulecka street with a Polish family given 
to us by the Russian governme nt. They sort 
of requisitioned two rooms from
 them, and they gave it to us. They had a very big 
apartment. If it weren't us, it would have been some body else. But the Poles, that fami ly -
- I don't recall their name  -- they hated us because
 of it. First of all, they hated us because 
we were Jews. Second, because we took away 
their apartment. We took away part of 
their apartment. But throughout 
all of that I still 
rema ined friendly and used to go visit 
occasiona lly this cont ractor, this Po-- Pole. We
 used to have chats. He had things that I 
wanted. He had a radi o transmitter and radio receiver, which at that  time  was not illega l.  
 

02:04:34 

 

 There was a Polish governme nt in exile, and he
 used to work or be connected with the 
Polish -- with the AK, the Armi a Krajowa,
8
 which was the Polish underground, which 
was basically antisemitic. I was able to ente
r the Polytechni c Institute of Lvov, and I 
became wha t  you would call one of the top students there. I ha d received a scholarship 

from the Russians, and I was ma king more with 
my scholarship and the 
side benefits than 
actually than my mother wa
s ma king on her job. So, we liv
ed pretty good. I had the 
freedom of move me nt, and that winter I d
ecided that -- we were
 in touch with my 
grandparents and they we re getting letters from
 my aunt and that cousin that I have 
me ntioned that was deported 
to Si-- Siberia, to Kazakhs
tan, with the little girl, how 
mi serable, how bad off t hey are there. So we 
went to -- I went to 
Lida. I visited whoever 
was in Lida. I went to the little town where 
my gr andparents were. I visited them, and the 
                     
8
 Ho me  Ar my (Polish). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311

thing that I reme mber -- it was so primitive. They had a big sto-- big oven in the mi ddle 
of the house with rooms all around it. They used 
to cook and heat the walls of the, of the 
oven they -- to supply heat, and I had to sleep on top of the oven to keep wa rm. I spent a 

few days there. Then I tried to go to V
ilna, because Vilna being, being independent 
Lithuania, had plenty of food. Unbelievable how
 much food was in Viln
a. I went with my 
student papers without any Vi
sa, and I was told that if you are smart and you can bribe 
your way through, you™ll get by, you'll get there.
 After all, being cocky, being -- what 
was I then?  21?  20?  I go
t on the trai n. When it came to 
the border and they were checking 
the papers, I was told if you give the guy 40 rubl
es, which is four 10-r
uble pieces, he'll let 
you through. So, I was smart: I took four one-ru
ble paper, paper notes, which were the 
same  size as the 10-ruble notes. I me t him in the dark passage-- passageway. I snuck 

them in, and they let me through.  
 
02:07:30 
 

 I went to Vilna. I came back loaded but -- ab
solutely loaded with food. And we were able 
-- they were able to ship ch
eese, butter, crackers, cigarett
es; because y-- cigarettes, not 
that they smoked, but that you could trade 
cigarettes for anything–to my  aunt and my 
cousin, so they could use it to help them su
rvive. I didn't need it. I -- we had enough of 
food and everything. And I came back to Lvov.That was on my winter recess, from '4 0 

to '41. 
Q. These are huge distances you traveled. 

A. I, I did. I took a train. It 
was a train, an overnight train ri
de, or ma ybe even longer, from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
15 
 
Lvov to Lida. From Lida to Vilna we  took the 
train. From Lida to Vilna was a short ride. 
It's  only about an hour and a half by train. A 
lot of my friends that I went to school 
together with from Lida alone and from other towns. There was a little -- not far from 
Lida there was a, a summer resort, wh
at you would call, in pine woods called 
Novoyelnya. Novoyelnya was in a triangle 
between Berezhnitsa, Novogrudok, Slonim, 
and Lida. It ™s actually not a triangle; it™s a little more, where better-off- to-do fa milies 

used to pack up their belongings for the su
mmer, put it on a horse-
drawn cart; used to 
take it about a day for the horse to pull the th
ings into Novoyelnya, spend three months or 
two months in Novoyelnya, and then go back. Th
ere were two rivers there. There was the 
pine woods. It was a -- you could spend a su
mme r . And we used to spend summers there 
and I met -- made a lot of friends, which I 
st ill have, which I met in that su mmer -- 
summers. Some , some  of them survived. Many 
of them, in fact, survived. We  used to 

meet there every year, and when my  family
 decided one or two -- twice -- that they 
wanted to go to another place for the summer,
 I was upset. I said, ﬁI don™t-- I want to go 
there. I'll mi ss my friends.ﬂ These young peo
-- kids; we had a ball in Lvov. They were 
engineering students. They we
re art students. They were me dical school students. There 
was a lot of them that came  to Lvov because
 that was the only school of higher learning 
open to the public which was open to them, 
whi c h had higher standards than schools in 
the Soviet Union. Because they could go to Minsk, they could go to Kiev, for exampl e, 

but they were much lowe r standards. After a
ll, they had all Polish professors teaching 
there. And not just from Lvov, but professors 
from Wa rsaw and professors from Kraków.  
 

02:10:50 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311

 We have developed a group of friends where 
we were -- we stuck 
together always. We 
had little to do with people of -- with the Ch
ristian, with the Christians, in a way. That 

was more or less a group of Jewish kids 
that was together. We  had fun. We played 

together, and we studied together. In J
une 22nd, 1941, the night before we went to a 
concert, to an open-air con
cert -- if I don™t remember, I th
ink it was David Oistrakh that 
played in open-air -- gave an open-air c
oncert, and some body's comment was, ﬁ Where 
else in the world can people ge
t together, be -- and listen to 
a world class artist, and be in 
peace? ﬂ  A few hours later, bo-- we were woke
n up by bomb s. Hitler attacked the Soviet 
Union. A week later -- or eigh
t days later -- Hitler wa
s in Lvov. And I don't know. I 
watched the German troops come in; sunburne
d boys, you know, they, 
they were -- they 
looked so good you could never su
spect that they we
re capable of atrocities the way that 
they perpetrated later, or they, they were 
perpetrating now, on the Jews or other people 
any pa-- in ot her pl aces. They looked careless.
 They looked like they were -- like they 

owned the world. As soon as Hitler came  in, 
I think a week later, he imposed a ransom, 
that you have to -- all the wedding rings,
 all the gold, and I don't  know how ma ny 
millions of Polish zlot y the Jews had to 
collect. And everybody in good faith, they just 
gave up the jewelry, gave up the gold. The Germ
ans collected it, and the people that they 
held for ransom never came back anyway. 
Because they grabbe d imme diately a number 
of Jews and a hundred or 120 Polish intellectua
ls, college professors that survived the 
Russians. The Russians didn't touch them in spit
e what their ideas were, what they were -
- Russians didn't bother them, but the Germans ki lled them. Now, there was a go-- good 

question I was asked: ﬁWhy didn't you run away
 with the Russians?ﬂ The advance of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
17 
 
German ar my was so swift with their me thod 
whe r e they actually went in straight on one 
side, straight on the other side, and then they
 closed in. The army proceeded and anothe r 
army ca me from the back to sort of -- to, t
o, to liquidate the pris
oners of wars. Not to 
liqui-- to kill them, but to disarm, to disarm 
the, the, the ones that were encircled. There 
was no time to get out.  
 
02:14:32 

 

 However, many of my friends that we nt to 
school together, because 
the trains were still 
running, decided that instead of staying 
in Lvov, no ma tter what, they'r e going to go 
home . And s o me  of the m went back to 
Lida, some went back to Berezhnitsa, 
Novogrudok, and so on. And they did ma ke it. Th
ey did get home, because I, I found out 
later that  they did get home. They perished -- 
some of them per-- in fact, the majority of 
them perished.  
Q. Can you describe for me  the first few days
 of German occupation: what wa s going on in 
the streets; what you were doi
ng; what you were thinking? 
A. We were -- our apartme nt where we lived wa
s not in the Jewi sh area of Lvov. We  lived 
with a aristocratic Polish fa mily. They hated 
us, but they, sort of, they were more or less 
restrained, except for their son. In the begi
nning, there was no such a thi-- Jews moved 
norma lly throughout the city. Having 150,000 Jews
 in Lvov, part of Lvov became  like a 
Jewish district. There were nobody -- there was 
nothing but Jews in there. So, that was 
easy for them to find where the Jews  were. So, if they needed Jews for work, to clean up 
some thing, they used to grab them, go -- take 
the trucks, go into that
 area, and grab them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
18 
 
I had an experience that must have been a
bout a week after the Germans came. We st ill -- 
there was still no order that we had to wear ar
mbands with the Star of, Star of David, so 
basically I was dressed like anybody else. I 
didn't look typically Jewish. The only one 
that would know that I wa s Jewish
 we re my i mmediate neighbors.  
 
02:17:04 

 

 I was comi ng up the steps, going home , and 
the Ukrainian militia was comi ng down the 
steps, said, ﬁAre you this and 
this?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, that's my 
na me.ﬂ ﬁYou'r e Jewish.ﬂ I say 
so -- I denied on the beginning. ﬁGive us your pa
ssport.ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t have it with me .ﬂ 
ﬁLet's go home.ﬂ I asked him, ﬁHow do you 
know? ﬂ  Oh, he says, ﬁWe were told by 
some body r e liable how you look and that you we re 
Jewish.ﬂ And that was the son of that 
fa mily. They grabbed me to go to work. One of the places that we worked was the 
general jail in Lvov, where the Russians have ki
lled all the political 
prisoners. They sort 
of ma ssacred them. We  moved bodies from
 one place onto, onto truc ks. Those bodies 
were decaying already, and everybody knew th
e Russians did it; not the Germans, that 
one -- that ma ssacre. After that they grabbe
d me  again to go to work, and we went to 
work on the de-- on the railroad depot of Ja
nowska street. Ja nowska street was a place 
where the-- later was developed into a 
notorious concentration camp. I worked on 
Janowska street for a while. In 
fact, what happened to me , the first time they got me , they 
took my pas sport. I was able to get the pass
port back. I looked at
 the passport and the 
passport was written on parchment with Indi
a ink. India ink does not sink into the 
parchment. It lays on top of it. And being 
an engineering student, I used to do some  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
19 
 
drafting with the India ink. I knew if you took 
a very sharp razor bl
ade you can sort of 
peel off the India ink from the parchment w
ithout leaving a sign. You can scrape it off. 
So, I scraped the word , ﬁEvrei,ﬂ -- Jew, a
nd I wrote in the word ﬁBelarus,ﬂ -- white 

Russian, with India ink, the same  color India i
nk. So, the next time they got me  I showed 
it to them -- ﬁI'm not Jewish. I am -- what do you want from me?  I'm a white Russian.ﬂ I 

couldn't fool them. The guy grabbed my passpor
t. He says, ﬁGo there, go to work; when 
you come ba ck we'll examine it more care-- mo
re, more carefully.ﬂ When we got back, I 
saw that passport was laying on the side, and th
ere was a girl that was watching it with a, 
with a number of other papers. I, sort of, got
 back and I sweet-talked her, and I swiped 
that passport. I stole it from -- . I got back
 home a nd I -- my mother burned it. She says, 
ﬁIf they'r e going to catch you with that thi
ng, and they know who you are, all they have 

to do is say one word: ‚Put your pant s 
down.™ﬂ And because it
™s -- the point of 
circumcision was strict-- was restricted to 
Jews only in Poland and in Russia. Not like in 
the United St ates where, let™s say, most of 
the ma les are circumcised. So, she burned the 
passport, and I was without a passport and 
I went to work. I worked for a while on 
Janowska street. We  were carrying bales 
of hay from railroad cars onto trucks.  
 
02:21:33 

 

 The pay was good. After a day™s work, if they 
were pleased, we used to get a loaf of 
bread, a loaf of black bread, pumpernickel br ead, which was more than you can imagine 

because, who could consume a big loaf of bread 
that must have been, if you really -- if 
you look at it, that would be 
probably a four, five pound loaf
 of bread?  You could trade 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
20 
 
bread for anything. And that was still before
 the ghetto. My mother used to do the 
trading. I used to -- sometimes I used to 
come home with two loaves of bread. The 
Germans -- the German officer was good to
 us. We did a good job. We  were young and 
strong. There was no such a thing 
as beating at the time, but I 
have noticed that they was 
star-- they started to put up 
a fence around certain area on Ja
nowska. I said, ﬁAs long as 
they put up a fence,ﬂ -- a barbed wire fence,
 not just a fence -- I says, ﬁI don't like it.ﬂ 
And I -- one day I told them I 
a m sick. Another day I told them I don't fee l  so good. I sort 
of talked my self out of there. And by the time
 they closed in and they ma de a ghetto in 
Lvov, I was no longer on Janowska Street. I have
 me ntioned to you, I think, that my -- or 
ma ybe I did not. My grandfather had a brother 
who was also in that found-- partner in the 
foundry with my father. They had a daughter
 -- in fact, two daughters and a son. One 
daughter ma rried, and she ma rried a guy who wa s 
a -- he likes to be, he liked to be a 
bigshot, sort of was a ma kher.
 9
 He was a -- had a hand in everything. Whe n the German -
- and they moved as well, they move d to Lvov also from Lida. He was able to get out. In 

the ghetto, when just be-- while the ghetto was be
ing formed, or just before the ghetto, he 
knew a fa mily from Lvov who were socially or
 politically active in Lvov before the wa r, 
and through them you could get a lot of things
. I didn't know them. We didn't need them, 

but with the Germans, the place where you work
ed was of the utmost i mportance. Wor k 
papers, you had to have a document show
ing where you are employed, where you are 
working. And the things that you were doing there were rated according to certain 

priorities. We didn't know it on the beginning, 
but a different colored card meant life or 
death. I'm jumping the gun a little bit.

 In the fall of '41 -- I don't reme mber if it 
was September, I think, or October -- it was the 
first announcement that the Germans ma de of 
creating a Jewish quarter. They didn't call 
it a ghetto immediately. They called it ﬁJew
ish living quarters.ﬂ If you were caught 
outside of it, you were severely punished. Se
vere punishme nt meant beating, meant being 
sent to a concentration camp, or even sent to
 Janowska street, to the conce-- if you were 
young. 
Q. So there was a camp there at this time? 

A. There was already a camp. We  move d in, 
into an apartment. There was a Judenrat,
10
 a 
board of prominent Jewish citizens who were willing to take the responsibility of 

organizing the whole thing. They have create
d a Jewish police. Eventually, the Jewish 
police was uniforme d. They had a some  sort of
 a uniform and a uniform hat. To maintain 
order, because after a
ll 150,000 people -- that's a lot of pe
ople, and there were a lot of 
conflicts. When you mo ve into an apartmen
t occupied norma lly by two people and they 
say now you have to ma ke room for 20 or more.

A:  We happened to live across the street from the fa mous Polish candy factory which was 
still open and producing candy for 
the Germans. Later they clos

But that's, that™s incidental. We had to sort of
 -- it was easier for us because after all we

already made one move. We made a move from 
Lida to Lvov, so to move into the ghetto 
we were sort of condensed already. We didn't 
have all the earthly possessions that normal 
people have in a home. We left it with my -- th
e rest of the family, with my grandparents, 
that by this time they alrea
dy got rid of it. When we m
oved there, my, my uncle, my 
mother's  younger brother, the second younger br
other, moved in also -- moved also to 
Lvov. He was -- in the meanti me, he was able 
to get papers that he was a working man. 
He moved into Lvov, and he lived with us in
 that apartment; in that, you call it apartment 
-- in the room with, I think, two or three othe
r families. It was just beds and beds and 

bunks, and whatever you had you put it under the bunk or under the bed. You couldn't 

move around. Bathrooms you had to wait in lin
e. There was one, one kitchen where 
everybody cooked. Life was very difficult, but 
on the beginning we were not in the 

category of the very old or the very young. T
hose were the first ones to be captured by 
the so-called Aktions.

 Tape Two  
 
03:01:10 

 

A. On the beginning, we were living, prior to 
the gh-- prior to ghetto, we were living in a 
mostly Christian area, area, which wasn't  too 
far fr om the Polytechnic Institute. It  was on 

Wulecka Street, a very classy area with few 
Jews. Prior to the wa-- 
prior to '39, it was -- 
you would call it a restricted area;
 no Jews were allowed in 
there. That's  why when the 
Ukrainians went on the rampage, and they 
were killing and beating and ma ssacring Je-- 
Jews, they didn't come  i nto that area. They
 were doing it in areas where predominately 
Jewish. There was no sense for them to going afte
r one or two or three 
or 10 that lived in 
the area where they could go in places wher
e there were Jews  only, and distinct Jews. 
Because -- I never in my life had pe™ahsin
12
 (ph) or, or, or, or, or 
was dressed different in 
a, in a way that would distinguish me  from
 the other people. The rampage by the u-- the 
worst part about it, I knew some  of t he Ukra
inians from the Polytechnic Institute, and 
ma ny of the leaders of this -- not ma ny, but
 some  of them, act ually -- I knew them 
personally, from school. In fact, later I'll tell
 you I had an experience with one of them, 
but that will come -- that™s -- 
chronologically, it came  so muc h
 later that I'll tell it to you 
when I came , when I come  to this. But if I don't tell you remi nd me . 
Q. Wasn't  it surprising that these people that 
you went to school with 
were capable of such 
atrocity? 
A. The fact that they went to school didn't  
make them human. They were sort of like a split 
                     
12

ural of pe™ah, the long sidelocks worn by some  observant 
Jews.

personality. Did anyone -- would anyone believe 
that civilized Germans that gave us big 
ph-- such great philosophers and mu -- musicians and you name  it, were capable of the 
atroci ties they committed? That  was a comp
lete split of per-- personality. The same 
people that were admi ring -- going to museum
s during the day or -- 
the next hour they 
were capable of killing, ma ssacring, ma i ming pe ople because  they considered the Jews 

being subhuma n, being not of the same  cla
ss, not the same  -- they were not human 
beings.  
 

03:04:10 

 

 I was very di sappoint ed with that Polish fa
mily because they were
 the ones that pointed 
out me  to a German offi cer. We  were hom
e -- I was home with my mother, a knock on 
the door, German officer come s in. You leap
 to, sort of, ﬁAtten
tion!ﬂ You d-- you don't 
know what's  going to happen; an SS officer dressed in full uniform, and s o on. I didn™t -- 

I never spoke German. I could speak Yiddish. Bu
t -- in, in high school I took French as a 
foreign language. We were told by the teach
er that was teaching German that ﬁIf you 
think that if you are Jewish, and you think th
at you're going to be using Jewish for 
German as a substitute, I'll fail you. Ge rman is German, and Yiddish is Yiddish.ﬂ So, I 

said, ﬁWhy should I argue with him? ﬂ I went
 and I took French. Anyway this German 
officer came  in and ma de himself understood. 
I mean, he says, ﬁI heard that you have a 
camera.ﬂ And I had a beautiful Kodak camer
a that my mother brought me from the 
United States. And I knew that it was a good 
and original Kodak. Said, ﬁNo, I don't have 
it. I sold it.ﬂ He says, ﬁYou want me  to 
search the place?ﬂ So my mother says, ﬁYou 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
25 
 
better -- what, are you going to start up?  Give 
it to him.ﬂ So I s aid, 
ﬁI forgot. I thought my 
mother sold it. I thought that sh
e nee-- sold it because she needed -- she wa nted -- needed 
it for bread.ﬂ I took the camera out, and I gave 
it to the German officer. He says, ﬁNo. I 
am not going to take it fr om you. Here is a rece
ipt. I'll give you a receipt for five German 
ma rks that you sold it to me  voluntarily. No one
 will accuse an SS o
ffice r of st-- taking a 
camera from a Jew.ﬂ I had that receipt for 
quite a while. Wi sh -- I wish I had it now. 
Q. Was there a, a -- an atmo sphere of fear? 
 

03:06:35 

 

A.
 
Yes. There was a time already at, of -- where 
Jews had to wear armbands, and they were 
prior to the ghetto. If a German approached
 you, a Jew was not supposed to be on the 
sidewalk. You had to walk in the gutter. 
Rain, mud -- you had to get off and let the 
German pas s . You had to salute. Salute, by 
that time , meant take off your -- bow, and 

take off your hat to a German officer or a 
German soldier that walked, if you passed one. 
If there was any way how they could hu
miliate you, they found a way how to do it. 
Again, I didn't  live in the Jewish -- in the real
 Jewish area, but the th
ings that I have heard 
-- and I saw it myself -- where they used to
 grab the real religious one and cut the 
pe™ahsin, cut the beard, ma ke the m l i ck their boots
 to a shine, beat them t o a, to a, to a 
point where they were unconscious. They w
ouldn't bother -- maybe they wouldn™t bother 
young people like myself, because after all, we 
di-- didn't look different. We still had the 
armband. But it during -- while this was going on, 
I still kept in touch with that Polish 
fa mily. The only way how I could do it is you us
ed -- we -- I used to 
get dressed a little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
26 
 
better, not report to work, slip 
the armband off into my pocket, grab the streetcar, take the 
streetcar to the end of its run, and then walk
 that kilome ter and go over to his house for a 
talk -- just to maintain a fr iendship. We were 
talking to each other. He told me  he wa s 
working with the Polish underground resistance
. He gave me  some  na me s  of the contacts 
-- ﬁIn case you need it, you can
 rely on some  people.ﬂ I 
knew that he had a radio 
transmitter, and radio receiver, and a cache of 
arms. The reason why he was able to have 
all that; he had a big house. The front of it 
was like a shop, like a carpenter's  shop, and he 
was able to hide all these things be tween the 
stacks of lumb er and 
stacks of other things, 
between his tools, and they 
never bothered him. As the ghetto was tightening, and the 
Aktions became  prevalent every couple of w
eeks, we were lined up. We  had to line -- 
first of all they built a fence around the ghett
o. You had to enter through a ma in gate. And 
I reme mber one time that was in
 the -- late in the 
fall of '41, we were comi ng from wor k, 
because my job for most  of the time through that cousin that I have me ntioned that was a, 
a ma kher in the ghetto with the other fa mil
y. Unfortunately, I don't re me mber the name  
of the other fa mily, and they didn't survive.  
 
03:10:20 

 

 This cousin and himself and his wife -- rath
er, no, his wife was the cousin -- they didn't 
survive; but their daughter a nd her sister, they survived. 
I was able to get the right 
documents for work. My job was what you call ﬁRohstuffverfassungﬂ
13
 -- ﬁgathering raw 
materials.ﬂ We used to go to demolish places
, to demolished houses, to places where they 

used to gather all kinds of ra
w ma terial and put copper to copp
er, steel to steel, brass to 
                     
13
 Gathering raw ma
terial s (German). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
27 
 
brass, gold to gold, silver to silver. God forbid
 if anyone took a piece of gold or a pi ece of 
silver. That meant, if they caught you, th
at one meant i mme diate execution on the spot, 
right on the spot. Because you were searched
 at their whim. But the documents were 
excellent. There were ma ny times where the gr
oup, when we were lined up to go to work, 
and there were thousands of people on the 
ma in square of the ghetto, thousands and 
thousands, and the Germans used to come  in 
and say, ﬁThis group, go to the left; and this 
group, go to the right.ﬂ We used to show th
em our papers and, ﬁThis group, go.ﬂ And we 
always happened to go in the right directi
on where we, we were able to survive. The 
document saved -- definitely saved our lives by 
being in the right gr
oup with the right -- 
the beatings during the, during the work, while
 we were working, were rather rare. We  
didn't get paid. Occasiona lly they gave us
 some  food; you had to sort of ma neuver 
yourself. But being on the outside, we were able 
to be in touch with the outside world and 
talk to people and do a lot of 
finagling where we were able 
to smuggle in things into the 
ghetto. They didn't check us as well as they 
checked the other people. We  were, sort of 
call it, the Rohstuffverfassung 
was the elite, in a way.  
 
03:13:10 

 

 We survived -- I survived that way the Akti
ons where they went af
ter the old. They went 
after the young. They went after the sick. Th
ey went after just about anybody. I have 
witnessed atrocities beyond anybody's belief, be
lief and description. Because when they 
used to put us aside to wait what's  the wh
im of the ghetto commander, or whoever he 
was, I -- one was Wilhelm (ph), I think. A
nother one -- I don't recall their names. Gr--

Gruber (ph), I think;  I don™t recall. We were -- I saw them beat to pulp, execute, kill, 
shoot. I saw them take a little baby and tear it in
 half. That's one image I'll never forget in 
my life. It, it, it just -- how subhuma n. Germ
ans did it. The Ukrainians did it. Now, how 
would you -- Germans were in German unifor m
s. The Ukrainians, they had their own 
uniform. Poles were not there, 
but there were -- they had a 
group of Russian prisoners of 
war which turned on the Russians. They gave them a na me  which I don't recall -- which 

co-- collaborated with the Germans that, that
, that did the dirty work. The ghetto was 
practically reduced to, to nothing, b
ecause from 150,000, when 1943 came there was 
20,000 left through de-- through killings, depor
tations to concentration camps, local 
executions. They used to kill and bury them. 
They had, outside of Janowska, there were 
places where they used to -- with ma ss graves 
where they were just ki lling one on top of 
the other. And all this time they were 
shrinking and reducing 
the ghetto, moving the 
fence and making it sma ller and smaller until 
-- it was right after New Years of 1943. We 
had a place where this Gajkowski, that's 
my cousin™s husband, my uncle. There was 

another ma n by the name of Pupko that was from my home t own, and I was, I was there.  
 

03:16:33 

 

 My mother wasn't  there already. Came  to us 
and told us that ﬁThe 
next three nights are 
going to be absolutely awful. You better try to
 get out. If you survive, you-- you'll be able 
to come  back, but it's going to be absolute
ly awful.ﬂ Now, the reason why my mother 
wasn't  there is some times that summer toward fa ll she was in touch with a Polish woman, 

a peasant Polish -- Polish peasant woma n that
 used to come  to the ghetto wall, and she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
29 
 
used to sort of give her items of clothing, it
ems of jewelry, and exchange it for bread for, 
for food with her. You could do it in certain sp
ots in the ghetto. So the woma n said to her, 
"Why don't  you come  and stay with me ? "  My mo
ther was very skeptica
l. Can I trust her?  
Because ma ny people -- there we
re ma ny, many things known wh
ere people used to let in 
Jews, then chase them out or call the Germ
ans and take away a
ll their belongings, all 
their property, all their jewelry 
-- what ever they had. So, my mother said, "I'll try. After 
all, I still have you. I'll leave some things with
 you, and I'll go there." So, she went there. 
It was about 35 kilome ters out of Lvov, in th
e direction of Ternopol. 
She went there, and 
she stood there for several weeks until -- and 
I know it because she told me that. My 
mother told me. The woman came to
 her that someone said to me -- 
 
[Technical interruption] 

03:18:40 
 
  So the Polish woman said that she was to
ld by some one that, ﬁYou must have some one. 
You're hiding some one because we sa w stra
nge shadows moving in the mi ddle of the 
night.ﬂ See, my mother was hidden in a barn
 on top but she had to take out all her body 
waste in the mi ddle of the ni
ght and dump it somewhere. 
So some one noticed some one 
running around in the mi ddle of the night. So sh
e says, ﬁYou can't  stay here and you have 
to come  back to -- you, you have to get out of 
here.ﬂ She left -- so she left the woma n and 
started to go back to Lvov to come  back to the ghetto. As they were comi ng -- she me t -- 

as she was comi ng, she me t another woma n, and you know two Jews -- two Jewish 

wome n, they sort of, you recognize each othe
r, even if you are dressed like a Polish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
30 
 
peasant with a babushka and all that, but you 
sort of you know, you recognize each other. 
They recognized that they were both Jewi
sh women, and they both proceeded to Lvov, 
and not far from Lvov, t hey were caught by 
a patrol, by a German patrol, who was out 
searching for escaped Jewish boys from, 
from, fr om Janowska street, from the 
concentration camp. The  guy, they beat him up 
and they gave my mother and the other 
woma n shovels. He says, ﬁDig yourself a grav
e. You're going to be shot right here.ﬂ 
What are you going to do?  They started to di
g. In the meantime, the patrol came out of 
the woods with a couple of other wome n, a
nd the, the SS guy said to the other wome n, 
ﬁ What are you doing here?ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ she says, ﬁwill you save us. We  ca me  to see our boys 

who are on Ja nowska street. We  wanted to see them. We know that they are in 

Janowska.ﬂ ﬁYou verfluchte Juden!ﬂ
14
 He shot the other two women. He put them in the 
graves, in the holes that my mother and th
e other woman dug. He made them cover them 
up, and he said, ﬁI had enough killing today. Verschwindenﬂ
15
 -- ﬁget lost,ﬂ to my mother 
and the other woma n. They ma de their way b
ack into the ghetto. When I came  that day 
from work, I didn't recognized my mother, be
cause after all I never saw her with bl ack 
eyes, with a swollen face. I never saw her like 
that in my life. But I said to her, ﬁThat's 
not the place for you. Let me  try,ﬂ because I go ou
tside the ghetto, ﬁlet me  try to talk to 
Czachor,ﬂ to this Pole. And I went to work. 
I slipped the armb and. I went to -- and I went 
to visit that gu-- that Po-- that Polish guy. He
 says to me , ﬁI can't  give you an answer.ﬂ 
He said, ﬁLet me  think about it.ﬂ I said, ﬁPleas
e, I mean, things are very bad. You -- try to 
help me .ﬂ I appealed to his patriotism.  
 
                     
14
 ﬁYou da mn ed Jews!ﬂ (Germa n)  
15
 ﬁDisappearﬂ (Germa n). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
31 
 
03:22:13 
 

 To his -- more than his Polish patriotism is
 to him -- I said, ﬁYou are a huma n being. You 
are trying to save another human being which 
is not guilty of anything. The only guilt is 
that she was born a Jew, but what did she 
do?  She didn't do anything to you. She didn't do 
anything to anybody. Take my mother and let her 
stay with you.ﬂ I was able to get back 
in time to come  back to the ghetto. A few days
 later I went there again, and he said, ﬁOk, 
let her come, but I must get paid for it.ﬂ I sa
id, ﬁHow do you want to
 get paid? ﬂ  He says, 
ﬁI don't want your money. I'm not going to take
 your money a nd all that.ﬂ He says, ﬁI 
want an equivalent of a pound of butter, th
e value of a pound of butterﬂ -- of a kilogram 
of butter, actually; that's  two pounds -- ﬁper w
eek, per week of stay. Whatever -- and you 
give it to me  in any denomi nation, any curre
ncy that you want -- that you can give me .ﬂ 
So, we had some  dollars. Fortunately, we had si
ngles. So my mother 
took a lot of singles, 
and we exchanged some  dollars. You could exch
ange the money in, in ghetto for singles. 
You could do all these things. 
And this ma n that I have me ntioned, Pupka, was one of the 

guys that used to deal with gold, with currenc
y, and all that. He was from Lida as well. 
My mo-- I got my mother there. In fact, sh
e went there by herself. I didn't go with her 
because two people would have been much easie
r to detect. One was easier to get, to ge t 
through. I mean, after all, it was easier for one
 pu-- she, she wa -- she got dressed like a 
peasant woman. I s muggled her 
out of the, out of ghetto a
nd put her on the 
streetcar and 
she -- I got word that she's there. 
Q. How do you smuggle some one out of the ghetto? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
32 
 
A. Through the gate together with the people 
that go to work. See, the person -- there was 
always, there was -- there were groups, and th
e group -- the me n in charge had to present 
the papers, and he was responsible with his li
fe for anything that was going on. So he, he 
was checked, and if you were a group of 30 for e xample, and one had papers which we re 

not in order, two of them would have been
 shot: the ma n in charge and the guy who had 
the papers in -- not in order.
 I don't recall -- I don't think that
 I even told the guy that my 
mother is, is, is co-- coming out with us, b
ecause I didn't want -- it wouldn't  have been 
reasonable for him to know.  
 

03:25:30 

 

 It was better if he didn't know because, after 
all, all you have to do is pass the ghetto and 
get out, go not too far, and then she woul
d disappear and they would load us on, on 
trucks, on -- who knows, wherever we  have to go 
at the time. Usually we worked in a, in 
a, in a -- not in, in a gym– in an armory
 where they used to br ing in carloads of 
ma terials, raw ma terials, and we had to separa
te them. So she was already there. That -- 
the -- that January 2
nd
, when they told us about this bi
g Aktion that is going to happen, I 
decided I'm going to get out of th
ere. I put my best clothes, 
of course my winter coat. I 
wrapped my self in a white sheet, went across 
rail -- one -- it was in the mi ddle of the 
winter; there was snow. I got out of the ghetto 
across the railroad tracks and hid for three 
days and three nights. I had some  dr ied bread 
with me , and I used to me lt snow for water 

on the Jewish cemetery in the mausoleum. Because the Jewish cemetery was being 

destroyed already, the stones, but
 not all of it. Afte
r the shooting st-- subsided, I got out 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
33 
 
of the cemetery, hid some where, because there wa s always a curfew. You could not wa lk 
in the mi ddle of the night. There was always a curfew. You c ouldn't walk around freely. I 

went and I got in touch with the man that this
 Czachor gave me  as a contact for the Polish 
underground. He said to me  ﬁ Dispose of all 
the-- your Jewish thi
ngs.ﬂ He was the only 
one that knew that I was Jewish. And he told
 me  to go out of Lvov into a certain area. I 
was there for about 10 days or so, trying to 
get on my feet. It was in-- on a farm in a 
home , sort of. They used to se-- they used 
to go there. We  we re still in hiding, but in 
hiding with a Polish farmer as a Pole. Fortuna
tely they never asked me  questions about a 
catechism, and they never made me put my 
pants down. They sort of accepted it because 
my Polish was fl-- was flawless.  
 

03:28:30 

 
 After a week, a week or 10 days, we started 
going into action where we went and we -- I 
had a, a rifle. I had some  -- a gun, a six-s
hooter. And we went. We  -- once we attacked 
the German -- it wasn't  a German, it was a Ukrainian police station.  
 
[Technical conversation] 

04:01:00 

 

 We have destroyed this Ukrainian station, 
police station. They actually -- they, they 
burned it down. They wanted the records bur
ned. They claime d that there were some , 

some  records, some  incriminating records. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
34 
 
Q. How ma ny people were
 you operating with? 
A. There were seven of us at the-- that time. 

Q. Allme n?  

A. All me n. I didn't know a ny of them. 

Q. And this was part of -- 

A: Then we came --  

Q: This was a pa rt of the AK? 

A. That was part of the AK. Then we went 
back to the same  hiding place where we were, on 
a Polish farm, and some one came there -- people came there and there was one ma n, to 

me  he didn't  look familiar, but he says to me , ﬁDidn't you go the Lvov Polytechnic 

Institute? ﬂ I says yes, I mean– ﬁ Weren't  you 
always in a group together with–ﬂ And he 
me ntioned a few na me s. I said, ﬁYeah, they we
re my acquaintances.ﬂ He said, ﬁYeah, but 
they were all Jews.ﬂ I said, ﬁSo what?  I can 
have friends everywhere. I am very liberal.ﬂ 
But that gave me  food for thought
. I mean, if he s t arts to 
associate me  with Jews– The 
next time  we went on a similar thing, similar action, we had to lay some mi nes on a, on -- 

at a railroad crossing. They were trying to 
blow up a railroad crossing. And there was a 
counterattack of a Ger m-- of a Ukrainian poli
ce, also Ukrainians, also. They sort of 
discovered that some thing is going on, and I ha
ppen to be in front and they started to 
shoot from t he back, my guys, and I had a str
-- sneaky suspicion that they were shooting 
not at them, they were shooting at me . I sai
d, ﬁThis thing does not smell kosher. I, I, I 
don't want anymore.ﬂ So when we came back I gave them an excuse that I had to go back 

to Lvov, that I had to see some one, s o me  fa mily business, and so on. I came  to Lvov, and 

I went directly this Polish ma
n, Czachor, and I said to him that ﬁYour Armia Krajowa is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
35 
 
trying to kill me. I don't like them. They ar
e -- they don't like Jews.ﬂ He said, ﬁI know 
they don't like Jews, but you didn't have to 
tell them who you are.
ﬂ I said, ﬁSomeone 
seems to recognize me  or -- from the Polytechnic Institute.ﬂ So he says, ﬁSo what do you 
want me  to do? ﬂ I said, ﬁYou must take me  here
.ﬂ First, he hesitated but I stood there, and 
I talked and I talked and I talked, and sort 
of I gave him no choice.
 I says, ﬁI'm not going 
from here. I'm not leaving the place.ﬂ He 
accepted me , and I was there with my mother. 

That was, I say, just about beginning -- the e
nd of January of 1943. The, 
the, the -- late in 
the second half of January. We  were there fine.  
 

04:04:55 

 

 He had a baseme nt and he had a big shop, wh
ich was closed, where he rented one room 
with an outside entrance to the post office. 
And people that used to work for the post 
office used to congregate there twice a day, in
 the morning and in the evening, and they 
used to talk to each ot her and we could hear; 
they were all Poles. They us ed to talk to 
each other and we could hear the, the war news. 
On top of it, I built myself a little crystal 
radio set with an earphone and a crystal that 
didn't  need any power so I listened to the 
local radio station, to the Lvov 
radio station, of course, operated by the Ge rmans. It had, I 
thi-- very little Polish. It™s 
mostly German and mostly German news about the U-boats 
sinking, about the American convoys, and so on;
 the big successes of
 the German ar my. 

Re me mber that was the time  that they we
re in their full glory, in 1941. There was a 

newspaper published by the Germans in Polish th
at the Pole, he used to get it, and then 
we had it so I was fully aware of
 what was going on in the world. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
36 
 
Q. Did you know about -- did you know much about the camps? 
A. Yes. We  knew about the camps in the ghe
tto. We  knew a lot about the camps in ghetto. 
More -- we knew more than the wor-- world wants to give us credit. We  knew exactly 

about the incineration, about
 the gas chambers -- everything that was going on. 
Q:  How did you know? 
A: Some body told, and there was no reason why not 
to believe.  Some body had to tell. I mean 
those were rumors. No one who surviv
ed could tell us, but there were ru
mors that things like that were 
going on, that that was not resettlement. That they 
were not going -- being se
nt to another, like the 
Hungarian or some  other Jews were, were -- they
 believed that they were
 being resettled into 
agricultural settlements. We knew that they we
re not. It's quite possible, ma ybe the Germans 
themselves told to some people in concentra-- in
 -- on Janowska. Janowska was our main source of 
information. 
Q. So you were listening to the news and–? 
 
04:07:45 

 

A. We were li-- we were -- we kne
w what is going on, what is th
e status of the war. And the, 
of course, the German successes, they were quite
 exaggerated, but they we re true. It was -
- they di dn't lie that there was -- they put si
ege to Leningrad. They didn't lie that they 

were on the -- ri ght next  to Moscow, that 
they took millionsand millionsof Russian 
prisoners. Reme mber, America was not at war ye
t. The United States was not at war at 
that time. They were sending convoys to 
England, but we heard about the German 
successes when they were sinking the Ameri
can me rchant ships going to England in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
37 
 
North Sea, or  wherever, wherever the boats us
ed to meet them. A fe
w months later,while 
I was there with my mother, being in the base
me nt, we used to sleep most of the time in 
the, in the baseme nt. The baseme nt was not
 under the full house, which is important. 
There was pa rt of the house, the, the por
ch, which was not excav
ated, so actually the 
basement looked like an ﬁLﬂ shape. That will be
 of i mportance a little
 later. I st arted to 
see some  shadows running around, in the -- in hi
s work room, in his shop, and we looked 
and looked, and I could swear that there were 
people going there. So we confronted him. 
First he de nied, then he ad mitted. He had, beside
 us, he had: a Hasidishe family of seven; 
a woma n, alone; and the ma n, Pupka, who was 
his contact for exchanging money for my 
-- that my mother used to give him. He
 was -- he had -- he hid them upstairs.  
 
04:10:08 

 
 He didn't wa nt to tell us. I said, ﬁWhy didn't 
you want to tell us?ﬂ It turned out he didn't  
want to tell us because he, he said my mother would fa-- wouldn't pay him anymore; the 
love of money. He would say, ﬁLook, after all,
 the, the, the, the fami -- the Ha-- the 
religious family of seve n, they have so mu
ch money. Why should we
 be paying you?ﬂ He 
wanted to get more mone y than -- this wa
y. But after we con-- he confronted -- we 
confronted him, he got all us together in
 the baseme nt. We  -- acr
oss the L section, we 
built a wall. So we shortened the basement. We 
made a room next to the unexcavated part 
of the building. We  built a wall 
in there with a trap door that
 you had to get on the floor, 
crawl -- and crawl into
 the baseme nt, crawl into that r
oom. That was about four bricks 
high and about four bricks wide, because thatwas a brick wall to, to
 match it the rest . We 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
38 
 
ma de a little box, wooden box, and we painted the wooden box to look like bricks. We  
put that corner -- we ma de it in a dark corn
er. We  put a bench over it, put a lot garbage 
out there and sort of -- like 
that spot, let it be not noticea
ble, so you can't notice it when 
you come  into the basement. And whenever 
there was anything 
dangerous going on, all 
of us had to go and hide there. Because it 
was on the outside wall,
 we dug a hole in the 
outside wall and we hid in the sewer. So, we 
ma de a, a hole going to go to the, to the 
sewer so we could -- we, we used to separate 
-- we had to separate the body waste so we 
could flush the feces with the urine becau
se ot herwise it wouldn't go down. Close it as 
air-tight as we could. Water 
we didn't  have, however, he 
didn't  have water -- central, 
central water system. There was a sewer line, 
but no central water system. He had a deep 
well in his baseme nt with a old-fashione
d one-arm pump where 
you could pump, pump 
very good water, in fact. Well water. So we ha
d, we had the crystal radio in there because 
there was an electric powerlin
e going through there. We  didn'
t use the electricity. I used 
the wire that was disconnected as an ante
nna, because being underg
round, I wouldn't pick 
up anything with the crystal set. The signa
l wouldn't go through. But we used -- I used 
the electric wire as an antenna, and I was able 
to lis--  still listen to the German radio. I 
heard about the siege of Stalin
grad. We heard all of it. The Germans, of c ourse, didn't say 
that they were losi ng at Stalingr ad, but we
, we had a ma p and once they started to say 
where they were, all of a sudden they were 
a hundred kilometers west of Stalingrad. 
What happened in Stalingrad?  So we knew,
 actually, what was going on, on the, on the, 
on, on front. 
 

04:14:05 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
39 
 
 
Q. Did that give you hope? 

A. That gave us a lot of hope. That, so
rt of -- in the meanti me  -- I don't recall 
chronologically -- the German
s discovered the ma ss graves -- that was way before, in 
Katyn. Those were the ma ss graves of the Polish -- 10,000 Polish officers that were shot 

on Stalin's orders. They brought in representa
tives from the neutral countries, Sweden, 
Switzerland. They brought in th
e people -- representative, an
d they started to dig those 
gr-- mass graves -- those graves. And because
 the Russians, when they shot  those 

prisoners of war, they didn't do it like theGermans did where they ma de them undress, 

shoes went to shoes, pants went to pants, jack
ets went to jackets, ha
ir were shaved. They 
removed jewelry. I mean, the Germans were
 quite me thodical in their killing. The 
Russians shot, shot them right on the spot. So mo
st of them -- or all of them, actually -- 
had their docume nts on them so they could id
entify them. I saw the name of my mother's 
cousin on the list, the doctor, 
whose wife and daughter were 
sent to Kazakhstan. The wife 
lives now in Toronto, and the 
daughter, and the daughter is a 
psychiatrist in Toronto. In 
fact, I speak to his wife. She™s -- she just 
told me  she was 86. She survived, and we -- I 
visit her in, in Florida occasionally. That was 
because I was able to ge t, because Germans 
were so me thodical in publis
hing the lists. They did say 
that they didn't commit the 
crime; of course, the Russians accused them of doing it, but I think they ad mitted that 

they did it, that Stalin -- on Stalin™s or
ders. Anyway, it came  1944, approxima tely March, 
April, end of March, beginning of April of 1944. 
We were -- all the time we were in that 
baseme nt running back and forth, up and down. The ghetto was completely liquidated 

already, but Janowska Street, 
the camp, had a hundred or less Jewish boys there whose 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
40 
 
job was digging up ma ss graves and burning 
the bodies, destroying the evidence. But 
they were still there. All of a sudden, we 
were downstairs in the baseme nt because the 
situation was sort of tight. We  hear knocki
ng on the door and heavy German steps, heavy 
steps -- boots. We  ran into our hiding, and 
we didn't hear anything. We discovered later 
that the Gestapo and the Ukrainian police --  
 

[Technical conversation] 

04:17:38 

 

Q: We were talking about you heard the German boots. 

A: The German boots. We didn't know it in 
the beginning what actually happened. We  
found out later that some one has squealed on our
 -- the ma n that was hiding us. And they 
came, the German Gestapo, and the --  came to arrest hi m, not because he was hiding 
Jews, be-- but because  he  was a me mber, an active me mber, of the AK, the Armi a 
Krajowa, the Polish underground. They search
ed thoroughly the place. They found the 
rifles, the grenades, the, the ammunition, 
the guns, the radi o transmitter, the radio 

receiver. They arrested him. They arrest
ed his wife. She denied the knowledge of 

everything. She called neighbors as 
witnesses. They came, they 
testified that she -- that 
he never listened to her, th
at she didn™t know -- anywa
y, that she was completely 
innocent. The verdict was, after a month, to 
liquidate his property, 
take away everything 
that belonged to him, give her back the hous
e with one bed, one table, one chair, one 
dresser -- and that's it. That's hers. Otherw
ise, remove everything 
else from the house. 
Now, in the meanti me , we were there for a whole month in the baseme nt being -- not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
41 
 
knowing what is happening. Fortunately, right af
ter they -- we heard 
the heavy steps, and 
right after we  heard that, that
 the German police was there, we  had suspected some thing, 
that some thing is going on. What we actually di
d, we went upstairs, and she had a lot of 
stuff prepared: dried bread, ma
rmalade ma de with real sugar. We took it all down, and we 
had it in the basement. We filled our contai
ners with water. During the da y, we were 
sitting there without moving, but 
at night we were able to ge
t out to the -- to flush the 
body waste without ma king any noise. We  had, 
between us, there was a ma n out there, 
the father of the Hasidishe fa mily, who was deaf
, half deaf. His children used to actually 
have a pillow so they could put it -- because a 
deaf person can™t hear himself; he didn™t -- 
they, they didn't know if he was going to sc
ream out or say anything. They had a pillow 
just to put over his head and, 
if necessary, quiet hi m down.  
 
04:21:15 
 
 Fortunately, we went through that thing until th
ey decided that it is time to liquidate the 
house. We 'r e living on stale bread, which was not
 already stale, it was full of fungus, but 

when you have nothing to eat, fungus won't k
ill you, the green stuff. It mi ght give you a 
little indigestion, but it won't kill you. A
nd, surprisingly enough, in spite all these 
conditions, nobody got sick. We  slept on a wooden 
board covered with straw with a piece 

of cloth on top of it. The fleas that develope
d were so big that you 
could hear them jump 
when they were jumping. You became immune to it. It sort of didn't bother you anymor e. 

But, the -- to fulfill the ve rdict, they hadto remove all of his property from the house, 

with us being in the baseme nt in hiding. 
Who came to re move it, but the Jewish boys 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
42 
 
from Janowska street, from the concentrati
on camp, being supervised by Germans a nd 
Ukrainians -- being beaten there, cussed, 
yelled, and you name it. We he ard them mo ve 
everything. The -- we were afraid that so
me body is going to spot our box, the painted 
box, and go after us. Because whenever we went
 th-- there, before you moved the box in, 
you sort of ma de a me ss  on the ground, because
 otherwise you would see that that part 
was smooth. After all, some body -- when, wh
en you slide over cement, you sort of 
smooth it out. They did it on -- the, the actua
l removal of property 
took, took place four 
times. After the third time, this ma n Pupka sai
d, ﬁI can't  take it anymore. If they'r e going 
to discover us, all they have to do is th
row a grenade in and we 'r e all good as dead 
without even resistance.ﬂ And we had two 
guns. He had a, a, a gun, a six-shooter, and I 
have a five-shooter. I had a five-shooter with a five -- with five cylinders and an extra 
bullet, and I had six, six bullets
. He took his gun, he says, ﬁI'm going to get out of here.ﬂ 
We let him out in the mi ddle of the ni ght, 
and I was able to trace his st eps until the 
mi ddle of July of 1944, which was approxima te
ly two weeks before the Russians came  

in. I, I knew with who he was in touch with, 
and after that he disa
ppeared and he did not 
survive. At that time , I wasn't  positive, but now
 I defi nitely know that he di dn't survive. 
We were there, they came again. They emptie
d out the pl ace. They were -- ma ybe those 
Jewish boys, they saw that thing, but nobody ever
 said anything. We 'll never know. All of 
us survived; 10 survived in a hole.  
 

04:25:15 

 

 But this Polish ma n, he was -- his sentence wa
s to be sent to Au
schwitz. He was sent 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
43 
 
there, and he perished there. His wife came 
back, and that was already May. Prior to that, 
because there were two of 
them, and because he had money, he could buy food on the 
black market to feed us. It was all a matter 
of getting one meal a day, which was basically 

a -- some sort of a soup with some bread on 
the side. See, it's easy to buy some  extra 
bread, and soup she cooked, so she ma de s
oup. I mean, wha t  was in the soup, who cared?  
When she came back, she said, ﬁHow a m I going to feed you?  I'm alone, and you are 10.ﬂ 

She says, ﬁYou better get out of here.ﬂ We  said to her, ﬁHow can we get out? ﬂ  I says, 

says, ﬁIf we get out of here, it's  like good -- 
like you're signing your own death sentence, 
because no ma tter how much we 'll deny, once they start torture you, some body is going 

to say where they -- where, where they were
. It's  impossible to deny completely.ﬂ Says, 
ﬁYou have a garden, see what you can do.ﬂ She, 
she -- we sort of convinced her. We  ha d 
a bowl of watery, watery soup every day. I 
don't know how ma ny calories a day it was. 

Who knew - -  first of all, I didn't know what 
calories were at the ti
me . But we sort of 
survived. The big disappointme nt was -- I still ha
d the crystal set. I st ill was able to list en 
to the radio station, to the lo
cal radio station, what didn't te
ll you the truth. There were 
still local newspapers. There 
were rumors. The Russians stopped by the Polish town of 
Ternopol, which was only about 60 kilome ters, 
that will be–east of Lvov, and they stood 
there for a month because they tried to stra
ighten out the front. And they stood and they 

stood, and we were suffering and praying that
 they should come , every day. Finally, the 
Russians came  in and liberated us on theday after my birthday, July 27, of ‚44. We  

wanted to come  out of the hole. Says, ﬁI 
can't  let you out,ﬂ said the woma n. ﬁI don't my 
neighbors to know that I was hiding Je ws. They 
will sa y that I am a Jew-lover. They will 

say that my husband perished because he ha
d Jews, which I know it isn't true.ﬂ We  stood 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
44 
 
there an extra day, and one by one we got out
 in the mi ddle of the night, the following 
night where we were imme diately arrested 
by the, by the Soviets because there was a 
curfew. We sleptin cityhall 
on a table, and the first questi
on of the Russians is, ﬁSo why 
weren't you fighting actively?  Why -- what di
d you do in hiding?  You -- you are nothing 
but a bunch of cowards. Go and tell them th
at there was nobody to fight with.ﬂ Because 
the first thing was to save our lives because
 if I went with th
e Ar-- with the Armi a 
Krajowa, I would have been dead, and the ot
her 10, they were all -- 
 they didn't know one 
end from a rifle -- of a rifle -- 
to another -- from the other.

A. I had an interesting incident
 while I was in, in hiding. I did 
go out from t hat hiding on one 
or two occasions, actually, to do some --  to
 do certain things which I had to do. On one 
occasion, I was walking in a very non-Jewish 
area of Lvov, and all of a sudden -- dressed 
properly -- without the -- the 
ghetto was already practically already liquidated. There was 
no ghetto any more. I -- all of 
a sudden, I feel a heavy arm 
on my shoulder. I turn around 
-- and I had a gun in my pocket. I see a Ukra
inian policeman put an arm on my shoulder, 
and he says to me , ﬁIsn't  your name  Jasz
a?ﬂ And that was my nickname , my Russian 
nickname . I say ﬁYes,ﬂ and I put my hand in my
 pocket. He says to me , ﬁDon't be scared 
of me . I know who you are. I know what you ar
e. I'll let you go. I will not do anything. I 
know you are Jewish. I know you are living 
on Ar yan papers, probably.ﬂ He didn't 
suspect that I was in hiding. ﬁJust be careful
. I won't do anything to you because I rec-- I 
recall that one of the test s what we had at the Polytechnic Institute together you sort of 

helped me  a little bit.ﬂ So, he repaid, that 
was -- he repaid a de
bt of honor, or dishonor 
because I shouldn't have been helping him. The c ousin that I was me ntioni ng, before the 

ma kher in ghetto, he and his wife, they went in
to hiding and they had a little girl at the 
time. That little girl at the tim
e was about four, five years old. They didn't want to have a 
little child with them in hiding, so they gave 
the child to a Christian family in a different 
town, but very close nearby. The mot her's th
at -- her sister was blond. She's about two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
46 
 
years younger than I am. She liv
es in Israel now. She was ab
le to procure for herself 
Aryan papers. All of a sudden, she became a sc
hool teacher, went into Silesia, into 
Slonsk,
16
 into western part of Poland, and 
became a governess, working for some body 
who had mo ney out there. And later she be-- 
she was, she was teaching with all, all 
forged documentation.  
 
05:04:15 

 

 When -- after we were liberated, my mother
 and myself, we were in Lvov, we didn't 
know what happened to them because we left 
the ghetto before they did. They left after 

us, and one didn't know where the other one is 
going. But the one from t he -- the, the, the 
cousin that was in hiding, that was on Ar
yan papers, came back. She knew where all of 
them were, but she didn't know where we were. But she came back to Lvov. She found us 
in Lvov, and she started to ask questions: Do
 we know what happened to them?  I said, 
ﬁNo, I don't even know where they were.ﬂ So, sh
e went into those two little towns. Fi rst, 
she was afraid but we went there, and she 
found that the cousin and his wi fe, some one  
squealed on them, they got them, and they we
re shot right on the 
spot. The little girl 
rema ined with that  Polish fa mily. So, when she 
went back to the -- when she went to that 
Polish family to get that girl, they refused to 
give her to her. But th
e gi rl, being at that 
time she was already five, five and a half, she 
recognized her, of cour
se, and they had to 
use the authorities. She got her. She's a grandmother now in Israel. 
Q. Let me  ask you: you were in hiding a long time – 

A. Yes, about a year and a half. 
                     
16
 Slonsk is the Polish name  for Silesia. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
47 
 
Q. And you just said that you only came out of
 hiding to do some  business once or twice. 
A. Right. 
Q. What, what did it feel like when you were 
liberated and you came  out into the daylight? 
A. It was a very strange feeling. It's  like newl
y -- being newly born. First of all, it was hard 
to believe that just about everybody you kne
w, that everybody that you were with, 

perished in spite of the fact that people that
 I went together to 
high school in Lida ma ny 
years ago, ma ny, ma ny of them survived because
 they went and they were with a group 
of partisans. But they were in a different 
area. The area where we were was ma ybe mu ch 
more antisemitic. We had our Ukrainians. They had their Lithuanians. They had their -- 

the Poles were just  as bad in both places. But the territories, the area itself, was there 

were ma ny more jungles. There were ma ny more
 rivers. There were ma ny more inhabited 
areas. We were in more civilized area, whic
h was more cultivated, and because of it, it 

was much harder to hide. My feelings was th
at I hope that I will survive, and my first 
steps were to go back to the Polytechnic Institut
e, where I have attended, prior to that in -
- from 1940 to 1941, I put a full year of school
. The Germans mi ght have destroyed the 
faculty by killing them, by deporting them, but 
they did not destroy the records. So, all 
the records were there. They were pr eserve
d, and it was a ma tter of getting the people, 

people to dig them up a nd within a month, 
they had all the records out and I was 
accepted. 
 

05:08:32 

 

Q. Who was teaching?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
48 
 
A. People who came from Kiev, and some  were le
-- some  profes sors were left over, not 100 
percent. But people to -- from Kiev, from 
Khar™kov, from the Ukraine, even from 
Moscow. To teach in Lvov, it was a big honor be
cause the life in the occupied territories, 
that -- and that was an occupi
ed territory, that was not the 
original Soviet Union -- was 
still better than 
within the Soviet Union, and Lvov wa
s not as destroyed as the ma jor 
cities in Russia, in the, in
 the Soviet Union. So I --  
Q. Do you remember the first, the first few days
 of liberation, what that
 was like, what, what 
you were doing? 
A. The first day -- few days of liberation we 
were tryi ng to find a place where to live and we 
were given, by the, by the Russian aut
horities -- I don't know 
how to call them, 
occupation or, or liberated -- in apartment wh
ich was occupied by a German general, who 
ran away leaving a lot of thi
ngs in tact; a lot of food, some
 be er, some  -- a bunch of other 
things, which norma lly we wouldn™t ex-- norma
l people wouldn't expect to find. He ran 
away real fast. Later, they took it away fr
om us. They said it's too good for you, but at 
least we had it on the beginning. Then, it was a 
ma tter when, when we left our hiding, I 
had on me  nothing but rags. From sliding on the 
baseme nt floor into -- in and out of that 
hiding hole, all the clothes we
re just in, in, in shambles
. There was nothing but holes. 
You couldn't keep anything inside becauseeverything was mo ldy there. You had to 
delouse yourself because the fleas were as -- 
they were the size of flies. When they 

jumped you could hear them jump on top of, 
on top of straw. It was a ma tter of finding 
some  clothes. It was a ma tter of going on to the ma rket. They had a Russian name  for  it 

called tolkuchka.
17
 Tolkuchka, it means ﬁone was pushing the other,ﬂ where you sort of, 
whatever you had for sale, some one would 
buy it from you. I reme mber on the very 
                     
17
 Black ma rket (Russian). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
49 
 
beginning, because I spoke fluent Russian -- af
ter all I, and a good Ru
ssian, too. After all, 
I went to school; most of my s
ubjects were taught in Russian.  
 
05:11:24 

 

 Interesting, one of the courses 
that I tried to use, get credit 
for it, as Economics in here, 
when I came  to the United States, was the basis -- the basic study of Leninism and 

Stalinism. They didn't give me  any c r edit 
for it. They said, ﬁThat's not our economics,ﬂ 
but I tried. That was taught in Russian. A Ru
ssian soldier stopped me , and he says, ﬁCan 

you buy from me  some t hing?  I say, ﬁI can't  
buy from you; I have no mo ney, but if you 
hang around here for a few hours, I'll sell it 
for you.ﬂ And those were can, cans of 
American ham and beans, like C-rations, but
 big cans that the American, that the 
Americans supplied the Russian army with. Th
ey were being sold on the black ma rket, 
and I sold some of the m at
 a very, very good profit becaus
e it didn't cost me  anything. 
And whatever the Russian soldier got, I mea
n, he was happy to get some thing for it. That 
was my first black ma rket experience. From 
-- after that I -- that™s
 the only way I could 
survive and, and do something. I used to buy paper. I found a printing shop that used to 

print lines on the paper, then I found so
me one who that a bound, a bound-- a bindery, and 

used to ma ke notebooks, with a couple of st
aples and a notebook with a cover, and we 
used to sell notebooks to the Russian soldiers. That was like over a thousand percent 

profit. Unbelievable. They used to go like 
hotcakes. And, like everyt
hing else, it lasted 
for a while and then, then -- some one -- then, then the Russian governme nt started to 

print it. But until then --  so we made some 
money that way, and then I st arted to go to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
50 
 
school. 
Q. Did you feel safe? 
A. Yes, I did feel safe, in spite of the fact 
that at one time my mother worked for a supply 
depot, and her boss said to her, ﬁYou know, 
I'd like to sell a few big cans of i mitation 

honey butter.ﬂ It's like a honey butter spread 
which was strictly Ger-- which was German. 
So, she says, ﬁOk, I'll try,ﬂ and she got me . I 
took some  of it, and I went to sell it on the 
ma rket and the cops, the Russian police, gr
abbed me , arrested me . They locked me  up. 
ﬁ Where did you get it? ﬂ First I didn't tell them
, then I got in touch with this ma n who 
supplied it, and I asked him, ﬁ What should I 
do?ﬂ He says, ﬁDon't worry, you can tell that 
you got it from me.ﬂ I told him I got it through 
them. He says, ﬁAnd I 
thought we cracked 
a major, a major thing, a major --ﬁ And they 
let me  out. That was the only time I was in 
jail, in a Russian jail for 24 hours, interrogated. 
It's not on my record. They never kept the 
records of it. 
 

05:15:30 

 

Q. What about the local population? 

A. That's  why I didn't feel, I didn™t feel th
reatened. The Russian 
po-- the local population, 
the Ukrainians, they ran away. The ones that
 did the Ukrainian militia, and so on, they 
ran way from there. The Poles, they didn't want
 to stay. They tried to mo ve to the western 
part of Poland. So who were 
-- I think -- the people that rema ined were the Jews, the 
liberated Jews that were there, that weren't 
too ma ny at all, and the ethnic Russians, that 

came there because the life there was much bette
r than in Russia itself. So I felt fairly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
51 
 
safe, especially -- I would call myself that I 
was within --  between the intellectual elite. 
After all, I was a college student . I was in s
econd year of Polytechni c Institute with a, 
with a scholarship from the governme nt. It's 
not that I believed in their system, but I 
could get all the benefits from it without put
ting anything into it. So, when the Russians 
gave Poland the eastern part of Germany, or
 the we-- they extended Poland west, so that 
they could keep the part of Poland that they 
have occupied in '39, like Belarus, like Lida, 
Lvov. They announced that Poles, or anyone w
ho is willing to repatriate hims elf into 
Poland, is free to do so. You can take w
ith you anything you can carry. Of course, you 
can't  move furniture, but you can take anythi
ng you can carry, with 
you. So, in -- I think 
it was in '45 in August, I think, -- yeah, ar
ound August -- we decided that there's no future 
in there and we'r e going to repatriate. We  got on a train and we went to Lodz. 
Q. Let me  just ask you a couple questions here. 
Wh en you said th-- that in Lvov most of the 
people were ethnic Russians or the few rema in
ing Jews, what size of a Jewish community 
are we talking about?  Were they able
 to kind of reclaim the community? 
 
05:18:14 

 

A. No. The Jewish community ma y be from all 
-- because whoever was 
liber ated, they sort 
of ca me  to Lvov, because there is a safety in
 numbers and safe ty in a bi g town. When I 
say there were Jews, there were still Poles in Lvov. A lot of Poles, the community was 

several thousand, but not even
 in 10 thousand, several thous
and. The sma ll towns around 
Lvov, after the liberation, they had pogroms,
 believe it not, wher
e the local population -- 
you see, Jews, when they came back, they try 
-- tried to claim thei
r property. Of course, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
52 
 
the locals didn't want to give it to them, so
 how -- what's better than try to get rid of 
them? The, the, the expression was al ways, there were -- ﬁWhy didn't they kill you? You 
are too ma ny of you left.ﬂ The local populous was 
al-- they we re always Jew haters. They 
always despised the Jews, if it was before the 
war or after the war. There were very, very 
few that were sympathetic. My -- our friend 
Czachor, the one that saved our life, when 
we confronted him in convers
ations: ﬁ Why are you doing it -- ?  ﬁ 
 

[Technical interruption] 

05:19:55  

 

 

 

A.   Czachor, when you -- when we confront
ed him on ma ny occasions, we had a lot of 
discussions with him;  after all, we we re doi
ng nothing. We  were the 
intellectuals, and he 
was a carpenter who became a contractor, whos
e children were educated. They were both 
-- both his daughters were in Kraków. In fact, 
I used to send them 
packages later when 
we ended up in, in Italy. He sa
ys, ﬁI didn't do it for money.ﬂ He
 says, ﬁI had to have the 
money because I am not a rich ma n. I couldn't feed and sustain, and what was the harm if 

I ma de a couple of bucks?ﬂ he was saying. He didn't live to enjoy it, unfortunately. He  

said, ﬁI'm doing it strictly for, for huma
nitarian reasons. I can't  see people being 
slaughtered and extermi nated for no reason at 
all. The only reason is because they were 
born to the wrong parents or to
 certain type of parents.ﬂ 
I mean, the fact that he 
supported, he was with the Jews and the army 
of Ar mi a Krajowa at the same  ti me , wa s a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
53 
 
contradi ction in itself because the Armi a Krajowa, they never said they were antisemitic. 
But in their actions, they neve
r supported the Jewish resistan
ce. In Lvov itself, the Jewish 
police, which was -- whose basic job was to
 ma intain order having 150,000 people living 
in one small area, and selecting people for ex
termination; like they say, ﬁI li-- you live 
and he dies or what? ﬂ  They -- some body had 
to, some body had to do it. Now, was it more 
huma ne that the Jewish police did it?  Wa s the -- 
were the Jewish police traitors to the-- to 
their fellow Jewish brothers? I wouldn't  call th
em traitors. I think it was their way how to 
survive maybe a little longer, hoping that that
 they can save their families, when frankly 
they did it. If they didn't do it some body else woul
d have done it. It's  
not that they -- if 
they didn™t do it, it wouldn't  have been done. It would have been done ma ybe in a more, 

more cruel wa--  cruel way. The end result woul
d have been the same; it's just a matter of 
how you, how you slaughter some body. The Jewish 
police wa rned ma ny people, like they 
warned me , about the forthcoming Aktions; a
nd if not for them ma ybe I wouldn't have 
been alive now with that January '43 incident . Then again, ther e was a time when they 

couldn't me e t  their quotas given to them by th
e Germans -- and for a fact, I know it, I can 
really -- I can testify to it
 -- that they were sort of 
exchanging: ﬁYou, you tell where my 
grandparents are hidden and I'll tell wh
ere your grandparents are hidden.ﬂ  
 

05:23:46 

 

 When you had to -- when, when they couldn't meet the quotas, says, ﬁAfter all, they'l l go 
sooner or later,ﬂ for the -- when the, when th
e, when the Aktion was to get, get the older, 
the disabled, the sick. One would sort of 
tell not where his relatives were hidden, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
54 
 
would point out where the other ones, and the 
other one would point to
 the other fellow's  
relatives. Now, I didn't know if I cou-- I don™t kn
ow if -- I didn™t want to be a Jewish cop. 
I could have been but I didn't want to do it. I 
was approached. I didn't wa
nt it. I, I felt that 
this is just cruel and inhuma n. I 'd rather ge
t killed myself than, than point to some one 
else. 
Q. How did people get chosen? 
A. Appearance, age, state of health, and luck. 

Q. Connections? 

A. Just -- it was a ma tter of luck, that you were
 in the right place at 
the right time, because I 
know there were times when some one escaped fr om Janows ka, and we knew about it. 

Every 10th guy they gave the, the, the comman
der, the ch-- head, used to give for him -- 
for, for, for the escapees to come  back. If 
th-- if they didn't come  back, every 10th guy 
was shot. They just walked and counted: 
ﬁ10.ﬂ [Makes shooting 
sound] Bullet to the 
head, and that's it. And no one was allowed to
 mo ve or anything else. Now, how did they 
pick the 10? It was nothing but luck. And if 
the men didn™t -- if the me n di d come  back, it 
were -- there were, there were cases if the 
me n di d come  back, they still did the same  
thing. 
 

05:26:10 

 

Q. Actually, what I was asking was, you were
 talking about the police and how people got 
selected to, to be a me mber of th
e Jewish police or of the Judenrat? 
A. The Judenrat is the activists. The first Judenrat was hung. The first Judenrat of Lvov -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
55 
 
reme mber going out to work, comi ng back, a
nd there were 12 people hanging right across 
the ma in gate so everybody could look and see. Not shot, but hanging. So you didn't look, 
so what? But they were still ther e. Why? Be
cause of the whimsy of the, of the German 
occupation, whoever he was that ordered th
em. There was no consensus. There was no 
such a thing as a discussi
on or due process or law or anything. The Germa n, the 
command-- the commandant, he was the law. 
He was the absolute king over life and 
death, the absolute power if 
you live or you die. There was n
o, no discussion. In fact, if 
you said anything, that wa s -- if you talk against,
 it was enough to be 
shot or be beaten. 
The tortures were unbelievable. The kind of
 tortures they thought of were beyond 
description. There is -- you think of
 a way, and they did it worse.

[Brief technical conversation] 
 
Q. Ok, so I don™t know; we were talking about th
e ghetto, ma ybe you want to continue there. 
Give me  a few -- ma ybe some  more details 
of, of what life was 
like in the Lvov ghetto? 
A. Life in Lvov ghetto was very, very I gu-- it™s
 di fficult. It's difficult to de scribe because 
one day was just like another. When th
ere was no Aktion, we did our job. Nobody 
bothered us. When there were Aktions, it was ju
st like, like hell opened up. I reme mber at 
one time we were -- one Aktion, which was co
mpletely by surprise. We  went to work. 
While we were at work, they ma de an Aktion 
in the ghetto itself. It -- an Aktion, I me an 
when they, when they took a thousand people, that meant no-- nothing. I think, when I 

describe an Aktion is five, 10,000 people had t
o, had to be exported, 
liquidated, or killed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311

They -- we got stuck in a place where they
 were growing -- where a, a family was 
growing nothing but beets, white -- not red beet
s for borscht -- but white beets, because 
you can ma ke sugar out of white beets. And 
for three days we  had nothing but white 
beets. We  ate white beets. We  cooked them. 
We, we, we, we simmered them. We did all 
kinds of possi-- all kinds of th
ings because we were afraid 
to get out. That was the only 
thing that sustained us. We we
ren™t able -- because if you 
were, if you were caught during 
the Aktion, some ti me s even the best favors 
wouldn't save you. They numbered the quota, 
the order of to liquidate, to, to, to solve 
the Jewish problem, was higher than the, the 
papers that would save you, th
e documents that would save 
you. That had priority over 
everything. 
 
06:03:38 

 
Q. Were these Aktions regular?  We re they often? 
A. They were quite often. They were quite often. They were usually, or ma ny times, they 
were preceded by a Goebbels speech, esp
ecially an inflamma tory Goebbels speech, 
which you could listen to on a, on a, on, on radi
o, on crystal radio. I could listen to him. 
It's not I that understood; to me , it sounde
d like a dog barking. I couldn't understand 

everything, but that Hasidishe family, they were
 quite fluent in German. That was in, in -- 
otherwise, I had -- we -- in, 
in the ghetto, ma ny people had 
crystal sets. We listened to 
that, to that, to those things and we sort 
of told each other. Then there were local 
newspapers that used to print Goebbe ls sp
eech -- speeches, and so on. There was Polish 
papers; of course, they printed what they wa
nted to be printed. Bu
t that was one -- oh, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
57 
 
Hitler's speech. That was usually at the time when all -- we knew, we knew to expect 
some thing right after it. Many times we were 
told by the, by the police, by the Jewish 
police, ﬁExpect some thing.ﬂ They were quite 
regular, because to get from 150 to 20 or 15 
when I left the ghetto, that's a lot -- 135, 
130,000 people. That's a lot of people to move. 
And they were able to do it without actual
ly exterminating, killing too ma ny of them 
locally. There were all trains going out. The 
-- Janowska was more or less -- more of a 
labor camp t han an extermination camp. It had no ovens. It had no, no, no way how to 

dispose of bodies except for burying them, becau
se the ma jor problem of the, of Germans 
was  -- is how to dispose of so ma ny bodies
, so they were actu
ally burning them. 
Q. Were there any semblances of normal life in the ghetto? Were -- was ther e any cultural 
activities, any polit
ical, any religious? 
A. If there were religious activ
ities, they would have been st
rictly self-contained. They were 
not condoned, and they were not -- whatever
 you did, you could do whatever you wa nted. 
While there was no Aktion, you could do anythi
ng you wanted. You could live -- it's not 
a norma l life, but you could live a life basi
cally without fear. Germans -- the Germans 
had free access to the ghetto. If
 they needed to unload some thing or do some thing, they 
could come  in with a truck and say, ﬁYou, you, you and you -- raus!
18
 Come  on with us.ﬂ 
That's it. Some ti me s people used to come  back, and some ti mes they didn't. It was an 

everyday occurrence. But as far as family lif
e, there was no such a thing as a family 
provider. Every -- everybody had to do some th
ing. The basic elements of fa mily life 
didn't exist. There were no schools. There wa
s no religious life as such. There was no 
breadwinner. Whatever you co-- whatever every 
me mber of any fa mily could get, it was 
assembled together. And if you were nice 
enough, you would take 
in some  strangers 
                     
18
 ﬁOutﬂ (German). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
58 
 
ma ybe to make a larger group out of it, if 
the stranger was willing 
to share his findings 
with you. It wasn't  communal because what 
was mi ne was mi ne, was not yours. Don't 
touch my things. It was sort of a code of
 honor, because when you went to work and you 
left your things there, other people could take
 it and disappear with 
it. They did not, not 
that I know of.  
 

06:08:20 

 

Q. Was your mother working in the ghetto? 

A. No, my mother was in the ghetto very little. 

Q. What about clan-- clande
stine activities?  I know
 that they wouldn™t -- the authorities 
wouldn't condone religious or, or cultural ac
tivities, but did people form groups?  Did 
young people date? 
A. I was a young person, and I didn't date anybody. 
I was just trying to survive, trying to 
survive. And how quickly you learn how to 
sa-- save your energy, how quickly you learn 

not to volunteer for anythi ng. If you have to
 do it, you do it. Don't volunteer, because you 
never know, you never know what 
-- let, let it be your fate. 
If you volunteer, you sort of 
supersede your fate. Try not to get hurt beca
use if you get hurt, your chances for survival 
are much, much smaller. Don't get injured. I 
had a time where a big piece of cast iron fell 
on my big toe and crushed the cartilage, the jo
int cartilage. I, I had troubles until it heal ed 
because I  -- it had 
to heal properly. 
Q. Weretheredoctors? 

A. What doctors?  If there were doctors, th
ere were no me dications. Maybe there were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
59 
 
doctors, I didn't know of any. 
Q.  Were there secret
 schools or publications? 
A. Not that I -- not that I know of. Not 
t hat I know of. Some  
public -- I saw some 
publications which basically dissemi nated news
. They were more or less publications 
which were printed outside the ghetto and 
smuggled into the ghetto. Like the Armi a 
Krajowa used to have publications which you 
could find in the ghetto, but they were not 
for the Jews and they were not by the Jews, 
and they didn't tell the truth about the Jews, 
either . They were ther e; it 
was mostly but mostly word of mo uth. Cultural life; I haven™t 
see any. Maybe there was; I didn't see any. 
Q. What about welfare organizations?  Di d the 
Judenrat set up any feeding centers, anything 
like that? 
 

06:11:12 
 
A. There were some . There were some  because 
I know. reme mber. The Germans: first, they 
went after the old; they went
 after the sick; and they went
 after the young. Now, the old 
you cannot hide. The young you cannot hide. But the sick, you can, because if you're 

younger and sick, or you don't look so good or you 
don't feel so well, you can try to cure 
yourself and hide. I reme mber seeing Aktions 
where people were carried out on stretchers 
and then they were ma de , sort of, get up and 
stand up and they couldn't. They were shot 
right on the spot, right there, 
and bodies were left. But if you 
came two or three days after 
it, the -- with the help of the police and with 
the help of the younger 
ones, they used to -- 
those bodies used to had to be removed becau
se ot herwise there would have been ma jor 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
60 
 
epidemics. Typhoid was a major sickness because
 typhoid is spread by, by lice, ha-- hair 
lice. I didn™t have, I didn™t 
-- I never had typhoid, but my 
uncle did. He survived it. But 
it's not that anyone went to a hospital. I thi
nk he spoke to some doctor that he told him 
what to do and not what to do. But what's  
the difference? You couldn't do -- you had to 
do what you could do. I mean, if he t old him, ﬁYou have a 105 fever, don't go to work.ﬂ 
He couldn't do it anyway because he couldn't go to work. 
Q. Was there a lot of sickness? 

A. There was. Typhoid was prevalent. There wa
s a lot of it. But then again, you sort of 
develop resistance toward things that norma lly
 affect you. I, honestly, I don't re me mbe r  
having a cold. I don't reme mber having a stomach 
ache or, or, or, or things that are -- that 
normal grip -- normal sicknesses that you get.
 You ju-- I don't reme mber having it. Or 
maybe I had it and I ignored it, because I c
ouldn't afford to show that I had it.  
Q. I have images of other ghettos where they 
said people were falling 
on the street, it was -- 
was Lvov like this? People were dying everywhere. 
 

06:14:00 

 

A. People were dying everywhere, but you didn't 
look at it. You got used to it and you paid 
no attention to it. Fi rst of a
ll, in what I was doing, I was 
working. I was out of the ghetto 
most of the day, and when I was inside the ghe
tto, I was in my living 
quarters trying to do 
things, help some thing. I didn't walk around th
e ghetto looking for 
things or visiting 
people or even talking to people. They want
ed me , they, they knew where to find me . I  
tried to live and be sort of
 independent. I was friendly with
 these people that provided me  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
61 
 
with these -- with the documents that -- but 
we al l lived together. We lived in the same 
general area. All of us sort of being 
young -- and young, when I say young, I don't think 
anyone at that, at that
 time  was over 40 or 45. 
Q. You said that when the Germans came i
n, they immediately disposed of the Polish 
intelligentsia. Did they do that with the Jews also? 
A. There was -- what do you mean by Jewish in
telligentsia? . Jewish intelligentsia, they 
didn™t ha ve to wh-- Jewish intelligentsia, as such, didn't exist to the Germans. They knew 
the Jews. The Poles, they were not going to ki
ll. They were going to ma ke them sort of 
like what you would call second class citizen
s or second class -- citizens is the wrong 
word. Second class inhabitants of the land. 
That's why they took their leaders, the 
intelligentsia, and they tried to kill them. They
 killed the majority of them. They killed a 
lot of them. The Jews were de
stined to be killed anyway. 
Q. But you said that they -- 
A: They did the same  to Je-- they -- 
Q: They took the sick, and they took 
the old, and they took the young first. 

A. They took the intelligentsia also. They cam
e with lists. They had name s of Jews. They 
had name s of Jews who had to be taken. Fi
rst they took them --first they took, on the 
very beginning, a very large group as hostages,
 and I reme mb er me mbers of the Judenrat 
or me mbers of the Jewish governme nt, what 
you would call, walking around from place 
to place trying to collect gold coins, gold 
rings, and so on, because there was a quota how 
much they had to, to give the Germans to 
save the lives of the group of what you would 
call the intelligentsia, the in
tellectuals; people that wereworth taking hostage because 
they would take hostages from the street. W
ho would care to pay for their liberation?  But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
62 
 
they were all known people, leaders. They 
collected the things, 
and, and those people 
never came back. They were, they were -- in 
fact, because they were the intelligentsia, 
they were killed earlier than the other pe
ople. And when I say the old and the young, the 
age criterium was not necessari
ly the determining point, because they didn't ask you how 
old you are, it was how old you look that count
ed. Because you could have been old and 

looked young and you got away with it. Bu
t if you were young, younger, and physically 

decrepit and looked old and so on, that was enou
gh to ge-- to -- for, fo
r them to arrest you 
or, or, or send you for extermination. 
 

06:18:30 

 

Q. What about the Judenrat? 

A. I had nothing to do with them. I saw one 
Judenrat hung. I know that they were there. I 
know that they were the necessary evil. I know
 that they have sort of transmitted the 
German orders, and they were a, a, a pawn 
or -- in, in Germa ns™ hands. If they didn't do 
it, they would have been kill
ed and some body else would have 
been in their 
-- put in their 
place. That was the, the, the German policy of 
sort of having clean hands. ﬁI didn't do it. I 
just, I just sa-- I just ﬂ They
 didn't dirty their white gloves. They just gave the orders. 
Q. Was there a lot of industry in Lvov?  Were there -- I know the work that you did, but were 
there a number of other factor
ies or did they take peopl
e out to places to work? 
A. There wasn't  much in the -- Lvov was not 
an industrial town. Lvov was more of an 
intellectual town prior to the war. Re
me mber, Lvov during the Austria -- Austra-
Hungarian empire, where King Franz Joseph was in
 existence, was the 
capital of Galicia. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
63 
 
It was the second, I would call 
ﬁmain city,ﬂ after Vienna, Vi
enna and Prague. It was an, 
intellectual -- town of intellectuals wher
e you had a me dical college, me dical school; a 
university, full university, a Polytechnic In
stitute. I mean, in one town of 150,000, 
200,000 -- that's a lot. The industry, the -- it wa
s not the ma in point of Lvov. So when 
they went after the intellectuals, they wanted to
 destroy the, the, the Polish spirit as we ll, 
prior to getting to the Jews. Ger mans were
 quite me thodical, and they knew they were 
going to get the Jews anyway, and it was easie
r for the Poles to go underground than for, 
than for the Jews. Because after all, th
e 30 million population of Poles, it was more 
diffi cult to control than the fe w Jews that were
 -- or the Jews that were scattered in towns 
only, because  Poles were mostly agricultural. 
Je ws were living in towns. They would be 
the, the, the money changing -- the money 
makers, the, the, the stor ekeepers and 
controlling quite a bit 
of industry in Poland. 
 
06:21:48 
 

Q. So after liberation, 
I th-- you went back to 
school, and then you 
-- I think you said you 
went on to Lodz, or you wanted to. But meanwhile, had you talked to anybody from 

Lida?  Did you know about the family you had left there? 
A. When -- two weeks after liber
ation -- really, two w
eeks after liberation -- I bumped in the 
-- on the free ma rket, where you were selling 
and buying things, I bumped into a guy my 
age from Li da who he and his father -- Li
da had a big cafe called ﬁThe Amerikankaﬂ
19
 --  
the American cafe. He and his father used to
 provide the entertainment. He played the 
piano and the accordion and -- in that cafe. I 
me t him. He was in a Russian uniform. He 
                     
19
 American woman (Russian). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
64 
 
was like the -- in the Russian US-- USO. He 
was entertaining the troops, and I had a long 
talk with him. He said he just came from th
e Bela-- Belarussian front. He was in Lida. He 
said, ﬁThere's  absolutely nobody left.ﬂ Downto
wn Lida was completely destroyed and it 
doesn't  exist. There was a ma in artill-- ar
tillery duel between the Russians and the 
Germans, and the area where we lived was wiped out completely. It absolutely doesn't  
exist. Some  of my old friends survived. They
 were with the Russian partisans, and they 
were with the Bielski™s Brigad
e. I don't know if you heard of 
the Bielski™s Brigade. I met 
the Bielskis here. I was quite fr iendly with Te
v-- Tuvia and his brothe
r and all that. They 
survived through them a nd with them, but 
there is absolutely
 nothing in Lida.  
Q:  What about 
your grandparents? 
A: My grandparents perished, he told me  th
at. My uncle died in Lvov, but my aunt who 
married the lawyer-accountant that worked for 
my grandfather, that had this six year old 
granddaughter -- they encountered a major tr
agedy, because during the ghetto liquida tion, 
in May of '4 3, him being an accountant and a lawyer and all that, and he spoke Germa n, 

he sort of spoke to a German guy and he trus
ted him that he will sort of allow them to 
survive that particular  Aktion that was to li
quidate the Li da ghetto. And he would show 
this German where my family hid their mone
y and their treasures.
 They buried it in a 
certain spot, which I knew where it was. My 
mo ther told me  and my mother knew about 
it because her parents, my grandparents, told
 her. It wouldn't have ma de any sense now 
because that building is no-- not in existen
ce any more. It's destroyed. But anyway, he 
took the German guy the r e. The German was going to let him and my aunt and the little 

girl go. Instead of it, the Nazis shot both of
 them right on the spot
, dead. The little girl, 
Gila, she was wounded, and she ran away. A
nd by -- on by the account of eye witness, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
65 
 
she was killed a few days later. But they we
re killed right on the spot, and the German 
got a me dal for getting the, the, the -- th
at thing and for kill
ing the two Jews.  
 
06:26:35 

 

 There was no sense for me  to go to Lida then, and in fact, friends of mi ne -- I have 
videos, video tapes, from vis
its to Lida by my fr iends that we nt. They put up monuments 
there in me mory. But again, my grandparents were
 not killed in Lida. They were killed in 
a little town outside of Lida. I chose not 
to go because there wa s nothing that I would 
recognize in there. There was nothing that I 
will see that will remi
nd me . I n fact, where 
the cemetery used to be there are now apar
tment houses. People live on top of graves 
without knowing it. The Russians pu-- decide
d to put up apartment houses in there 
because the Germans have removed all the to
mbstones. And it's quite possible that the, 
the, the, the Russians didn't  even know it 
was a ceme tery. There were three Jewish 
fa milies left in Lida, which probably don't ex
ist now. They probably pa-- they probably 

died by now because the first cont act with Li
da wa s through another cousin who survived 
with the French resistance in France. He was 
a doctor in Paris. He was one of the Gold™s 
assistants. He  was a psy-- psychiatrist invite
d on a -- to vi sit a scientific conference in 
Moscow. From Moscow, he went to Vilna, and 
then he was able to, to talk some one in -- 
into allowing him -- getting a car to go to Lida
. That was in '78, and he wrote his sister -- 
who survived the war also; and she died in 
Bo-- Boston -- a letter describing Lida. And 
seeing that -- and reading that
 and seeing that, I said there 
was no sense in going to Lida, 
so I never we nt there, and I'm not sorry. We  ende d up in Lodz. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
66 
 
Q. You and your mother? 
A. My mother with -- I met some people in th
ere. And from Lodz we decided to get out 
from Poland altogether. There was a choice to go
 to, to displaced person camps in Italy or 
in Germany. The Italian displaced persons cam
ps -- I chose to go to Italy because I had a 
better chance to pursue my education. See,
 I went -- I already had two years of 
engineering behind me , documented with documen
ts. The only problem - -  the only thing 
I didn't realize, I didn't have the original of my hi gh school diploma. I didn't realize how 

important that document is in Italy. We, we
 traveled using the underground railroad. 
From Lodz, we ended up in Cremona . We  cro
ssed several borders, 
in fact, I reme mber 
one -- crossing on border to -- from Poland to
 Czechoslovakia. We  had to be some body, 
so we were documented as Greek Jews returning to go -- from Ger man concentration 

camps returning to Greece. So the Czech
 guards said to us, ﬁWhy don't  you say 
some thing to us in Greek? ﬂ Nobody knew Greek 
so we started to talk, ﬁ™ma  neeshtanah

 We  were asking the four questi

A. You are rolling now?  My uncle, my mother
's  younger brother, who is 90 now, he went -- 
he was one of the original Halutzim
21
 that believed in Palestinein 1926. He left Poland in 
1926. He was barely 20 years old, 21, and my 
gr andmother got a stroke at that time 
because of it. He came back, stood for a, for a couple of mont hs, and he went back in '28. 

He ma rried my aunt. She came on a visit to Pa
lestine in 1936, and in order to go on a visit 
you had to buy a round-trip ticket to assure
 that you're comi ng back, but when she 
ma rried him, she was able to rema in there. So, 
they still have their return part of the trip. 

They -- 
Q. Tell me , tell me  about your passage to 
Italy. Wha t , what was the underground railroad? 
A. No. I want to tell you about the uncle. He told us he was in the British Brigade, and while 
we were in Lvov, he sent us a letter which cam
e  to us from Marseilles: to be ready to go 
to Odessa because his job is to repatriate
 Russian prisoners of war, to repatriate 
the–prisoners of war, so if we can ma ke Od
essa he'll smuggle us on a ship for us to go 
with him back, get out of the Soviet Union. Th
at part didn't work out
. But when we left, 
when in -- when we were in Lodz, the Zi
onist organizations, the -- it didn't ma ke 
basically any difference if you were the left
 side of the Zionist, which were the Ha-

Shomer ha-Za™ir,
22
 or the right side which was the Betar the --; all of them worked

together, I think, when it came to smuggling 
Jews  out of Poland with this underground 
railroad. The, the underground railroad used to
 put Jews into small groups, provided them 
with false papers, documents -- forged docum
ents, telling them where they were going. 
Like we were the Greek Jews leaving Po-- leaving a concentration camp from 
some where, going to Greece because we were 
basically traveling south. But as soon as 
we crossed into Cz-- Czechoslovakia, we got di
fferent papers, and part
 of us went in the 
direction of Austria, into 
Munich, that had a number of displaced persons; or through 
Austria, across the Alps into Verona -- Crem
ona and Verona, into Italy. That's  where we 
went. We  ended up in Cremona in a displaced
 persons camp. My mother got lost because 
she spoke English, so she got off the train and 
she went to talk to a, to an American 
convoy coming and she ended up in Munich, an
d I had to go to find her in Munich. I 
found her. So I spent a nice weekend in I
nnsbruck and Salzbrook (
ph) -- Salzburg, not 
Salz--! And came back to my group in, in It
aly, and we ended up in a displaced persons 
camp in Cremona. And then, from there, th
rough other difficulties, we ended up actually 
in a displacement camp - -  displaced
 persons camp in Rome, in Cinecitta.
23
 Cinecitta is 
the Hollywood of Italy, where they
 ma de movies, but the UNRRA
24
 requisitione d it and 
we were, we were there for a while and then we left them.  
 

07:05:35 

 

 My mother got herself some  sort of a job, a
nd I tried to enroll at 
the U-- University of 
Rome , because Rome  has no Polytechnic Inst it
ut e, and they wouldn't accept me because

in spite of the fact that  I 
had papers showing them that 
I have actually completed two 
years of Polytechnic Institute, in or der to st
art college in Italy, you have to have the 
original of the high school diploma. I didn't 
have it, and there was not way for me  how to 
get it. L-- I couldn't get it from Lvov because
 I left  there. So, I found some one from my 
hometown in Lida, who prior to -- before th
e war, because he was a Jew, he could not 
enter any university in Poland, 
he started in Pisa, in Italy. 
He needed transcripts from 
Pisa, so I, I sort of got a second thought and 
I said, ﬁI'll get you your
 Pisa transcripts,ﬂ I 
was in Italy at the time, ﬁit™s no problem, 
but help me . Try, try for me , try -- how can I 
get something that resem-- resembles the matura.ﬂ
25
 That™s high school diploma. I got 
him his papers, and he found my last high sc
hool sp -- high school principal. So I didn't 
know if he™ll would remember me. I took a 
po-- I took a picture, 
I took a picture of 
myself, and I sent it to him. The last gra
duating high school class 
was only 35 or 39; It 
was a relatively small class. He did reme mber
 me. He gave me  a sworn statement from 
Ministry of Education with grades on it, which looked more official th-- than the actual 

high school diploma. I took it back to the Univer
sity of Rome, but by that time, they were 
going to accept me  -- but by that time the American Joint Distribution Co mmittee 

organized a student home in Turin, Italy. The 
student home meant that they hired -- they 
rented a big villa, they hired an admi nist
rator, and Jewish, Jewish young me n and wome n 
who were willing to attend college, enroll -- 
and in Turin they had the University of 
Turin, which had liberal arts, had a me dical sc
hool, and had a Polytech
nic Institute -- not 
like Rome . Could live in that student home.
 The y would get a subsidy from the AJDC.
26
 
They would get their UNRRA packa ges into 
a central pool, tuition would be paid by the

AJDC as long as you went to school and passe
d a mi nimu m of grades. They -- that home  
was existence for, oh, I was there from '46 
to '4 8. I was there a year and a half. 
 
07:09:10 

 

Q. Did you mother go to Turin with you? 

A. No, my mother ha-- my mother used her pa
pers to go back to the 
United States. Then she 
found out that her husband passed away, in th
e meanti me. And the government would not 
honor the reentry permit, but she had some  frie
nds in here -- because it had an expiration 
date. The expiration date was just before 
the war started, so th
ey said, ﬁWhy didn't you 
come before the war started? ﬂ But the di
fference was like some thing like one or two 

weeks. She says, ﬁI didn't  have time to ge
t in touch with the American counsel in 
Warsaw.ﬂ I mean, there was already tension 
and friction going -- th
ings were going on. 
Anyway, she found friends in here that sent he
r an affidavit, and she used the affidavit, 
plus those papers, and she came to the States. 
My mother went to the States in '46, early 
in 1946. And I lived in Rome  for a while yet. 
I must have lived in Rome  three or four 
months after she left. And then I -- when 
this Jewish home, this student home , was 
for med, I was one of the first ones to movein there. And there were Jewish boys from 

Yugoslavia, from Hunga ry, from Poland, from
 many, many -- from Czechoslovakia, from 
ma ny countries. They are -- in fact, we me t 
once, oh, about 10 years ago, ma de a reunion. 
You wi-- you will find se veral doctors, engineers,
 and architects with 
the Italian degr ees 
which lived in that  Case dello Studente
27
 in Turin. I had a friend -- I still have him. I have 
a friend who was very aggressive, and he said, 
ﬁLet me get in touch with the B™nai B™rith

Hillel foundation. Ma ybe they'll sponsor me  on 
-- to an American University.ﬂ And he 
kept writing to Chicago, to
 the Hillel foundation in Chi
cago, and they found for him -- 
they found a place for him at the Virginia Polytec
hnic Institut e. He came  here in -- late in 
'47, to the Virginia Polyt
echnic Institute. Once he st
arted, I thought, 
all right, why 
shouldn't I try the same  thing?  So, I starte
d with -- the young lady's na me  was Marilyn 
Applebaum,  a very nice young lady. I wrote her se
veral letters with my
 very, very poor 
English, using a voca -- a dictionary. She 
found a place for me at the University of 
Illinois, and I got a scholars
hip from the Hillel foundation 
at the University, at the 
University of Illinoi s. A Jewish fr ater nity, Tau De lta Phi, was going to sponsor me , give 
me  room and board. They were paying tuiti
on. My mother lived in New York. She had a 
job. She was working. I was able to 
get a visa in February of 1948.  
 

07:08:10 
 
 But then again, in orde r to come  here on a scholarship, you have to have a place where 
you go after you finish school. You ca-- you don't co
me here to stay. I di dn't  have a place 

where to go. Italy wouldn't  accept me. I was there, but they wouldn't accept me  back once 

I left. I certainly wouldn't go 
back to Poland because that 
was behind the Iron Curtain. I 
had no place where to go, so AJDC got me
 a visa to Uruguay or Paraguay, I don't 
reme mber. One of the  -- these countries, one
 of these South American countries. So I 
promised them that I™m going to go back after 
I finished engineering. I came  here, I was a 
upper junior, after the first year
 -- after I finished my junior
 year, I had nothing but top 
grades. The university gave me  a scholarship fo
r foreign students. I gave back Hillel their 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
72 
 
scholarship. I said, ﬁGive it to some one else.ﬂ
 I do-- I said, ﬁI can't  use two. I don't need 
it.ﬂ I was still living in
 the same  frat house, living in th
e frat-house. I had my room and 
board, they were free. But I didn't need the tu
ition thing. Wh en I fini
shed my -- I got my 
bachelor's  degree. The dean of foreign 
students calls me  and says, ﬁYou know that 
Chicago sent me  a letter; they are going to 
deport you. You're finished. You finished your 
schooling, they want to deport you.ﬂ I said to
 him, ﬁSupposed I go for graduate work? ﬂ  
See, engineers in '49 were a dime  a dozen, because  all the G.I.s were comi ng out of 
school on -- under the G.I. bill. S
o, I, I went for a, for a ma st
ers, and in the meanti me , the 
Truman's law they passed that anyone who is 
in the States can stay here. I think it was 
1949 that they passed the Truman, Truman 
i m-- immigration act, and I had no more 
problems. That's how was I -- I was, I was able to rema in here. 
 

07:15:42 
 
Q. What year did you go -- I mean, whe n exactly did you go from Lodz to Italy? 

A. From Lodz to Italy, that was 1945. It took us 
about, close to -- it t
ook us several weeks to 
travel.  
Q. Do you remember what month? 

A. It was between August -- between August a
nd Sept ember, because it still nice and warm. 
We have traveled from one place to another. 
We  traveled from -- we stopped in Kraków 
for a day, for example, and I saw that Hasidish
e family. They were from --  they were in 
Kraków that we saved together
 at that  time. Then we were in Bratislava. We were in 
Prague. We  were in Budapest. We  were in Vi
enna. I was in Munich for a short time. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
73 
 
so the whole travel probably took 10 days, two weeks. 
Q. How long were you in this DP
28
 camp in northern Italy? 
A. Just a few months.  
Q: Was that ok? 

A: Because -- not that long because we went t
o, we went to Rome . We decided that instead 
of being in Cremona and being buried out th
ere doing nothing, we decided to go to, to 
Rome  where some thing is happening. 
 

[Technical interruption] 

 

Q. Well, I think what I was asking you about was the DP ca mps? 

A: The, the DP camps. 

Q:  Yeah. 
A. See, I could have been -- all right? 
Q:  It™s ok. Ok. 

A: I could have been, more or less I knew -- know
 a lot of people that ended up in a German 
DP ca mp, but not in a DP camp in Germany. But  even now the sound of German 

language affects me , sort of gives me
 the, the creeps. 
I don't like it -- 
Q: What-- 

A: -- in spite, in spite of 
the fact that I spent a few good 
weeks -- a few nice weeks in 
Switzerland, where they speak mostly German. It 
didn't bother me  there, but sort of I, I, I 

dislike them. I have a friend of mi ne, that we 
grew up together that stayed, hims elf, in the 
partisans, who actually still 
lives in Munich, and I can't  
understand how he can do it. Or 
                     
28

how he did it until now. He said, ﬁI only 
lived there. I only ma de my mone y here. I 
traveled all over the world.ﬂ I said, ﬁFine, 
but I, I can't  stand the sound of that -- the 
language, not just the people.ﬂ 
 
07:18:25 

 

Q. What kind of an adjustment was it to co
me  to the United States?  Do you reme mber your 
first impressions? 
A. I -- when I came  to the United States, one of
 the conditions that the 
American council that 
gave me  the visa gave me  is that I must go imme diately to school, because it was 

February 18, and school seme st
er started the beginning of Fe
bruary. So, if you're going to 
school, you must go to school imme diately. I promis
ed that I will do it, so when I came to 
the La Guardia airport, I had to take a plan
e, because on a boat it would have taken too 
long. The AJDC paid for my flight. I came TW
A on a Friday night, Friday -- late Friday 
afternoon, and the immi gration officer refused to
 allow me  to disembark. He said, ﬁThere 
are so ma ny people that come  here on funny vi
sas. Look at these guys,ﬂ he says, ﬁthey are 
rabbinical students. Do you think they came he
re to, to, to go to a rabbinical school?  
They'll ma rry and they'l l stay here.ﬂ He  says, ﬁWe have to check out your visa. 
University of Illinoi s?  And you speak poor English?  I me an, it doesn't  ma ke sense.ﬂ They 

put me -- they took me to Ellis Island. Ellis
 Island was still in existence. And the 

immi gration officer said to me , ﬁYou're the 
only one I'm taking to Ellis Island. You're 
going by taxi.ﬂ He said, ﬁLet me  show you Ne
w York. This mi ght be the only time you're 
going to be here.ﬂ So fine. So, one of the ma
in attractions he showed me  in New York 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
75 
 
was the Fulton Fish Market. That's one thing I 
reme mber, especially the smell. It is very 
strange; I came  to Ellis Island Friday night. I spent on Ellis Island Saturday and Sunday. 
Monday mo rning I was called, and they apologi
zed to me  for keeping me  there. I was 
given a pass. I came back to mainland. I don't 
reme mber where I slept. I don't re me mber 
what I ate. I don't re me mber what I did. Thos
e two days in -- on no ma n's land because I 
have left Italy on the 15
th
 -- or actually on the 14th. I came  here on the se-- on the 15th. 
The 16th and the 17th, Sa turday and Sunday, I 
was nowhere. The -- my official entry to 
the United St ates is the 18th. I was nowhere 
these two days. They don't appear anywhere, 
and I don't reme mber what I did then, how 
I -- what I actually did on Ellis Island. 
 

07:21:38 

 

Q. Were there barracks there or -- ? 
A. No, I was on Ellis Island now. I went to visi
t, but I don't reme mber physically what I di d. 
My me mory is blank for some  reason. 
I don't know why, my own me mor y. I spent 
another week in New York. I went to, to Illin
ois, and I went to school. And I -- because I 
was thrown into a fraternity of boys -- what 
were there, 40 or 50 American Jewish boys 
that spoke English only, that kne
w very little about a Holocau
st, that -- they didn't know a 
single foreign language that I could converse wi th them. I wa s actually forced to learn -- 

to, to, to ma ke -- to take a cras
h course of English. I forced my
self. I used to listen to the 
radio day and night actually, 
to get used to the sound of the language, because the first 
thing, in order to le-- learn 
a foreign language, is to get us
ed to the me lody, to the sound, 
to know when one word ends and the other one starts. Because if you don't know where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
76 
 
the words starts and the word begins -- one
 ends and one starts, how can you, how can 
you learn the language?  
Q. Did they accept you well? 
A. They accepted me  very well, in spite the fact
 that I was a few year
s older than, than ma ny 
of them, tha n the ma jority. They were 18, 19, 20, but there were some  ex-GIs that were 

there. I was sort of on par w
ith them, because I was already -- when I got there I was 26. I 
was actually -- no, ac
tually I was 27.  
Q. They must have seemed young or naïve or some thing to you? 

A. They did, they did, but they respected me
, you know, because to be a me mber and I was a 
-- I became a full pledged me mber of the fratern
ity. I started as a ple
dge. I didn't have to 
go through the hazing, through all that, you know,
 nonsense that a pledge goes through 
where you are pledgi ng. I don't know if you're 
fa miliar with it. I didn't go through, I, I 
didn™t go through it to the exte
nt that they put through ot
her, other, other young bo -- 
young me n. 
 

07:24:20 

 

Q. Any other first impressions of Amer ica? 

A. I reme mber my first trip to Chicago, for 
example. I mean, the majority of my friends 
were from Chicago of course, because Universi
ty of Illinoi s is south of Chicago. Seeing 
Chicago, talking to their parents, talking 
to their grandparents, to some  of the 
grandparents, and using the grandparents langua
ge, which sort of put me  one step higher 
than, than, than they thought of me . Sort of
 gave me a foot over them. Then my first 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
77 
 
Thanksgiving was very impressive because I 
ha-- I had to st ay at the University of 
Illinois. I had to ma ke -- I, I couldn't afford
 to take off a fe w days. I had to study. So I 
was invited -- one of the instructors invited me
 and, frankly, I never saw so much food in 
my life. Then actually, that was one of the 
few times that we had -- I had turkey which 
tasted good. In Poland, they didn't know how to
 ma ke turkeys. Turkey food was alw-- 
turkey meat was always dried out, so for a holiday they always used to ma ke a goose 

because goose was fat and the meat was much more tender, was fa-- was fattier. It wasn't  

as dry as the white turkey meat. 
Q. Did you start being a practicing Jew 
again, or was that important to you? 
A. I observed all the holidays. I obser-- I wa
s ma rried in a Jewish, traditiona l ceremony. My 
wife was an American born Jewish girl. My
 son went to Hebrew 
School. My son had Bar 
Mitzvah.
29
 He has a lot of certificates from the East
 Mid Jewish Center, 
prior to that fr om 
the We st Orange Jewish Center in New Jerse
y. We observed all the holidays, but we used 
to dr-- go on Yom Kippur
30
 we went to the Temple by car because it was too far to walk. 
I would not call myself a practicing Jew, but 
I still observe all the holidays and I really 
cherish tradition. In spit
e of the fact that my daughter 
married an Italian, fr om whom s he 
is getting a divorce now, she always -- after 
her mother passed away, she ma de all the 
ma jor holidays, holiday dinners, and holiday 
celebrations, including the Rosh ha-Shana,
31
 
and the Yom Kippur, and the Seders.
32
 I'm exposing my grandchildren to it. I don't know 
what's  going to be with my grandson. 
Q. But it's important to you?

07:28:00 

 

A. It's important to me . It's definitely importa
nt to me . And I believe it should be important 
to everyone because to be  a Jew you have to
 -- everybody should be proud of it, after 

what we went through because of it. 
 

[Technical conversation] 

 

Q. Is -- was, was there a point dur
ing the war when you resented it? 

A. No, I have always accepted it. I have never de
ni ed it. I could have been on Aryan papers, 
gotten false papers that I am not Jewish, whic
h would have been very easy to detect for 
anyone that I was, because of circumcisi
on. I -- the thought never entered my mi nd. I 
didn't want to do it. The times that I have
 ma squeraded for a non-Jew was for a reason, 
but I had to do certain things
, which being a Jew would not
 -- would have not have 
allowed me  to do so, like move freely in th
e city of Lvov, or carry
 certain orders or 
certain commands from to one pl
ace to another. But I have -- 
I, I, I was never hiding the 
fact that I was Jewish. I'm proud of it. 
 

08:00:55 

 

Q. In all this period of difficulty and hiding 
and I guess seeing a lot of experiences that I 
haven't been unfortunate enough to witness, are 
there certain images that have stuck with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
79 
 
you? 
A. Basically, there are, more or less I would call it, three incidents that, that got to me  more 
or less more than other ones. One would be
 the first time  whe n we came from work, 
when I saw the Judenrat, the 12 hanging at 
the entrance to the ghetto. Maybe because I 
sort of believed on the beginning that ma ybe
 the Germans are sort of civi lized. That 
would have been the fi rst act of murder committed directly by the Germans that I would 

attribute directly to the, the, the Nazi
 command. The second one is during one of the 
Aktions, where on the main square we were li
ned up, and we were waiting to get to move 
to go to work. That was during one of the Ak
tions where they were getting the old and 
the young. And it was rather quiet, and all of
 a sudden there was a cry of a baby. The 
German offi cer was startled because supposed
ly that all of the young and all of the ol d 
were already gone and there was nobody left, and 
he sent the -- these people to, to look. 
And he says, ﬁYou stand here, and you don't mo ve until I find what's  going on.ﬂ Now, 
that was translated to me because my Germ
an was not that good to understand everyt hing 
he said or even to hear wh
at he said. But that was related to me  by some , s o me  other 
people. And then they finally
 pulled a little girl  out fr om
, from a hole, from a hidden 
place, under some thing -- camouflage place. She 
must have been choking or what that 
she cried out. The two Ukrainian policeman star
ted to toss her from one
 to the other, and 
then the German says, ﬁ Ehh. That's  no good.ﬂ And two Germans, one grabbed her by one 
leg, one grabbed her by the other leg and th
ey pulled her apart, the little girl. She 
screamed out, and then she was quiet. 
Q. That was in 1941? 

A. No. That was in ‚42. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
80 
 
Q:  ™42. 
A: That was in ™42. That was in fall of '42 
because the weather was still ni ce. The third 
incident was when they -- our group, we were
 on the way to work and we were grabbed. 
A truck was standing next to 
-- a truck pulled up, and the h
ead of our group was arguing, 
the argument that ensued between him and the Sonderkommando
33
 head. A guy with the, 
with a black uniform, bl ack SS -- the, the SS ma n, he wanted us, and this guy said, ﬁNo. 

They are going to work.ﬂ  
 

08:06:10 

 

 And finally the -- our Jew convinced our SS 
ma n, our guy, that whatever we are going to 
do today is of such importance that he can't
 spare us, not even for a day. He gave the -- 
that, that man with the tr
uck took some body else. He got another group. We found out 
that no one fr om the other group survived, and th
at was sort of like, like fate. We  were as 
close as it can be to, to perish
ing at the time. But, but ma ybe we didn't know it at the time  
how close we came to, to, to being annihilated. 
In fact, every day was like -- more or less 
like that. You never, you never knew if you we
re comi ng back or not because they we re 
quite capricious and they could have -- they 
could do anything they wanted anytime they 
wanted for what™s-- for no reason whatsoev
er, without being afraid of ever being 
questioned, punished, or having to respond -- bei
ng responsible. It's just like if some one 
goes and kills a fly. When do--  who does he ha
ve to respond to?  No one. I me an it's they 
were dealing with non-huma ns, not even 
subhumans, but non-humans whose existence 
didn't mean anything to anybody. After all, soon
er or later you, you, you were destined to

be, to be exterminated. 
Q. Was most of the, the abuse that you saw or
 experienced perpetrate
d by the Germans or by 
the local Ukrainians? 
A. I would give it 50/50, however, whenever the Ukrainians did it, the Germans were 
present. It's not that the Ukrainians or th
e Poles or whoever else did it by themselves. 
There was always a German present, like they
 didn't trust them enough, and because of it, 
they were over-anxious, and they did it twice as, twice as good. 
Q. Are there other episod
es you want to me ntion? 
A. No, I think that's  enough. 
Q: That™senough. 

A:  That™s enough.  

Q. One, one -- I guess one last question fo
r you: what gave you whatever strength you 
needed to get through all of this? 
 

08:09:20 

 

A. My mother was a very strong woma n because whenever she saw a German, she used to 
stick that pi ece of paper in front of his 
face, ﬁI'm an American.ﬂ Not -- they never 
honored it, but she saved it all the way, and it co
uld be her help, could be the fact that I 
just didn't feel like dying. I didn't feel like 
gi ving up and, and forgetting. After all, I said 
to myself, ﬁI, I went to school. I have a bright future of me  -- I had a bright future ahead 

of me . Why should I give up?ﬂ Ze
st of life. I never gave up.  
Q: And you thought you™d get through it all. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
82 
 
A: There were people that were quite desperate.
 The ma n who was with us, he said, ﬁI can't 
take it anymore. They'r e going to kill us, th
ey™re going to -- ﬂ when we were in hiding, 
when they were removing all that furniture 
and all those things from the basement. He 
left. Unfortunately he did not survive. I guess my
 fate is such that I should rema in and be 
able to tell it as it was. 
Q. Did you have any dreams at the time or -- ? 
A. Maybe I did or ma ybe I didn't. I, I don't reca
ll. I'm sure I did. I am sure that nightmares 
were there, however, we were 
quite exhausted every day. That 
we were glad that we are 
able to sleep anywhere. I did have an -- oc
casionally nightmares, reliving what I -- my, 
my past, because when I applied to the --  I 
don™t know what they -- 
for the reparations to 
the German government, they gave me a lump
 s u m of money for being in the ghetto, 
which was just a few hundred dollars. When 
it came  to disability, I had no physical 
disability, fortunately for me . They made 
me  claim first physical disability, then I 
claime d me ntal disability. They gave me  -- 
I don't re me mbe r  what percentage and so on. 
Then it went to a review court in Germa
ny, in Köln, in Cologne, Germany, and they 
rejected it. They said if the ma n could go to
 school right after it,
 co-- go study in Italy, 
come  here and get two degrees in engineeri
ng, where is his me ntal disability?  So, they 

rejected me . So, I'm not getting anything, and I 
-- frankly I don't care. I don't want it. I 
have ma de whatever I have I had ma de 
it myself and I don't need the Germans.  
 

08:13:05 

 

 In spite of the fact that it's a different ge
neration, another generation, 
whatever it is, I still 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0311  
83 
 
don't like them because I still think that 
they ha ve  not repe nted enough. They have 
benefited to an ﬁnthﬂ degree from what was 
stolen, what was confis
cated, what was taken 
away. The property that my fa mily owned in 
what is now Belarus, I am not trying to 
claim because I have no proof of any kind. Peopl
e that were there are dead. They are not 
in existence. There are no documents ofany kind. In Lida ever
ything was destroyed, 
burned. I have no proof of any kind, just te
stimonials. And on the ba-- basis of 
testimonials of other people, nobody is going to
 give anybody anything. So, I'm not even 
trying it, and I'm not even doing it
. So, I have reconciled with the fact that I have to live 
with what I ha-- what I ma ke and what I have
 made, and that's fine. I a m very happy with 
it. The money that I have gotten at that-- at one
 time, that lump sum, went towards a in a 

small, very small part, I took my fa mi ly, my
 wife and the two ch
ildren, and my son and 
daughter, and we went to Israel, right after the '70 war.
