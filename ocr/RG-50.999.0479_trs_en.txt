W ebegin with this 1945 portrait of  David Bayer taken inhis hom etown af ter liberation.
 
On thism ap of Europe, the arrow points to Poland where David wa s bornSeptem ber

Here is a contem porary photographof  David's hom e in Kozienice. 
 
 
David's brother Joshua is in this1938 photo of a Zionist youth group.  He is in thethird 
row, third f rom  the left. I can put the cursoron him  in case you can'tsee it t

In 1939 Germ an troops invaded Poland starting the Second
 
W orld W ar.  The next 
year the Bayers were f orced tom ove intotheKozienice ghetto.  Here we see a vie w ofthe 
Kozienice ghetto through thebarb

wire f ence that enclosed it.
 
 
In September
 
19
42 the ghetto was liquidatedand its inhabitants, including members of 
David's f am ily, were deported to theT reblinka killing center. Thearrow points toT reblinka.
 
David was taken to
 
Pionki, an industrial com plex that producedm unitions.  In 1944 he was 
deportedtoAuschwitz.   Our second arrow points to Auschwit z. 
 
 
T hisnext photo shows a fencearound thebarracks in them ain camp atAuschwitz.

population in your town? 
 
>> David Bayer:  About 5,000 Jewish people livin g in the town
 
of  a
bout 12,000. So it was 
alm ost 50/50 population, half  Jewish. T he Jewish people inthat town were all shoem akers, 
t a ilo rs
, jewelers.  The surrounding area was all farm s. And every T hursday there was market 
day.  They get along very well with the population. W e lived therefor hundredsof  years. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your father, was he a 
s
hoemaker?
 
>> David Bayer:  My father was 42,41.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwas his occupation?
 
>> David Bayer: W hen he got married,his parents wanted him  to sit, read the Bible, and 

study. T hat's all.  He didn't want to do that. So he went in the shoebusiness.  He was working 
hard.  Then 
he opened his ownf actory.  W em ade out good. W ehad a showroom , abig shop.  
W esold shoesall over the country.
 
 
W ell, the Germans cam e in Septem ber

All kind. They broke it.  They took whatever
 t
hey want.  She was crying.  Mother was cr yin g.  
I'll never forget that she was crying.  I was ve ry upset and still are. 
 
 
T here was a curfew.  W ecouldn't get out.W ehad nof ood.W e had nothing.  I went 
out, wenttoa bakery to wait for bread. Sopeople were lining up to get bread. 
 
There was a 
curfew.  T he Germ anscam e and tookm eand everybody else f rom  there and locked usupin 

the church.T he church was closef rom m y house. W e lookedout our window, we could see 
the church. Hundredsof people locked up inthat church.  My m other was standing inf rontof  
the door, wait

andwaiting f or m e, crying.  My younger brother cam e out f rom  the
 
--
 
f rom  the 
churchyard I waved tohim  andhe saw m e. So m y mother knew wh at happened, where I am .  

So shef elt a little bitbetter.
 
 
T he n  m y gr o wn
-
up sister, 19 yearsold, she was ablond, beautif ul girl, she went
 
t o a  
town outof  Kozienice, m aybe 30

kilometers. I was locked up.  From the churchthey tookm e 
there. She bribed the guard to letm eout,f ree.  Shetookmoney.  She bribed the guard.  I 

c a m e h om e.  
 
 
T hen thepersecution started.  Day af terday,ever y day, the Germ ans walked in our 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

house and askedus to put the Starof  David on the door
 b
ecause the neighborhood had to 
have a Star of David on thef ront of the door. 
 
Oneday they cam e in, took m yf ather out. 
Maybe six Germ ans cam e in and gothim .T hey w
anted him  to dig di
tches
 
or som ething, I 
don't know, behindthe church. My m other was worried, cryin g, cr yi ng.  I should goand 
exchange m yself f ormy father. T hat's what Idid.  I went toexchange m yself . Buthe slipped 
away and I took his place.  T his
 
was one day.
 
 
T he second day they took
 
--
 
this was Gestapo man. This was not civil ian, regular 
G e r m an
, b
ig shots. My uncle, m y younger brother was working f ora Gestapo man. W hat he 
was doing was washing his clothing, shininghis shoes, cleaning his ap
artment.  The German 

was nice to him . They gave him f ood to takehome. Som y uncle was justm arriedafew 
m onthsago.  So he asked the German if  
he
 
couldbe exchangedfor m e.  He agreed. So I 
went to work instead of m y uncle. He didn't go.  I wentto workf or the Gestapo man. 
 
He was good tom e, too.  He gave mefood to takehom e.  I was happy.  Ever ybody had to 
wo r k .   
 
 
T he Germ ans occupied all the Jewish people to work for nothing
:  s
weep the sidewalk, 
shovel the snow
, w
hatever, to keep us busy.
  
B u t 
this Gestapom an, a big husky guy, he was 
in
 
charge of the wholearea
.  H
e hada Polishyoung boy, 18 years old, in thedungeon.T here 
was a door inthef loor.  It was the basement
, a
 
young m an. They are accusing him for having 
a gun. Theboy was sl eeping in a barn.  Andthe Germans raidedthe area and they f indagun
 

i
n the barn.  Andtheyaccused him f orhaving the gun. He cried, he begged. He said, "I
t's n o t 
m y gun."

But I was the translator.  I speakGerman
-
to
-G
erm an and translate f rom  Polish.  
The 
boy, I never knew him because he's notf rom m y hometown.  He was f rom  somewhere else.  
He keeps saying, "
T
his is notm y gun," he cried all the tim e.
  
So about two, threetimes we had 
interrogation. I was translating.  Oneday, all of  a sudden the discussion he was saying, " I
t 's  
notm y gun.  Ididn't do nothing.  I was sleeping there." T his Germ an who was good tom e,he 
gave m ef oodand I worked with him ,pulled apistol and shotthat boy in the basem ent.  I was 
scared. I thoughtthey're going to do the same thing to me.
 
 
W hat I'm  trying to bring out to you is he shothim for no reason.  Hedidn't believe him.  
No jury, no trial, no nothing
; j
ust a gun and shot him .  And I hadto take him out andbury him  in 
thef ield.  He's probably still there now.  Thiswas Gestapo man.
  
T hen he left and he wanted 
m eto go with him.  
I  sa i d
 
no, I can't leave m y parents
;  
I have to be hom e.  So I worked with 
som ebody else.
  
Youhave to be busy.  If youworked, the Germanssent you to Auschwitz, 
sent you to cam ps som ewhere else.
 
 
T hen they toldus tomove outof  our house. T hey were creating a ghetto.  All Jews 
would li ve outside the Jewish 
neighborhood;
 
have tom ove into theghetto.W e hada big 
house, aboutf our bedroom s, storage room s,all kinds of hallways.  W ehad
 
to leave 
ever ything.  Besides, the Germ ans took half of  it away anyway, m achinery, whatever. 
 
So we m ovedto one room.  One room we got.  Ihad topull whatever I had ina sled. And 
th a t's it. 
 
 
My sister was looking like an Aryan girl, blond
.  S
o one da
y she put on a wooden 
cro ss
; s
he got apair of boots we were hiding.  She wentto thefarm to sell the boots.

>> Bill Benson:  She walkedoutof  the ghetto?
 
>> David Bayer:  Shesneaked outunder thebarbed wire, an area that was not so visible. She 
never
 
cam e back.  I never sa w m y sister again.  She was 19.  She was abeauty.  She was 
dressed very nicely.
 
 
Af ter the war I went to the farmer and he toldm ethat she was thereand sold the 
boots and gotfood.  She was carrying a canvas bag with all kindsof 
food.  And the Gestapo, 

the Nazis
,  
got her, locked her up in a jail.  In 1942, Septem ber
 
27, they shippedaway all the 
peoplef rom m y hometown to Treblinkaand killed them
, a
lmost 8,000 people.  Because there 
were m ore peoplef rom  the surrounding towns brought into our ghetto.  So there was about 
8,000 people. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  David, before you go onf rom there
, 
when they liqui dated the ghettoand took 
the8,000away, bef ore they did that, besidesyour sister, you also sneaked out of the ghetto.  
Righ t ?  
 
>
> David Bayer:  I sneaked out som any tim es.  I'm still sneaking out. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  And how would you do that? 
 
>> David Bayer:  I riskedm y lif e som any times because we hadtoeat. My mother was 
alwa ys worried.  She was praying, alwa ys praying.  She was praying, her Bible,alwa ys 
praying, all the time. God will help.  God will  help.  But God didn'thelp. 
 
 
T he reasonI mentionGodbecausea lotof  questions people ask, in school, high 
school kids, your relation with God.  A lot of tim es I don't want to talk about it.  Idon't want to 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
talk about God.  Because we were reli gious people.  Here we hadnobody to help us.T hat's all 
we got is God.  AndGod didn'thelp.
 
>> Bill Benson:  David, when the ghetto was liquidatedand yourf am ily was taken, you were 

away work ing on the irrigation canal.
 
>> David Bayer:  I went to workf or the irrigation canal. About400 to 500 peoplef rom m y town 

went to work there,all the young people. The Polish governm ent were building the canal 
bef ore the war.  And the Germ ans continued to do it
 b
ut with slave labor, likem e.  And every 
day, practically ever y day, I had a chance to sneakaway f rom the canal and go tof arm ers to 

begf or bread,f orfood.  W ent to thef ield, steal potatoes.
 
 
Oneday when I cam eback to the canal,there was nobody near the canal
; o
nly the 
shovels and the wheel barrels
, e
verybody was gone. The Germanscam e and tookeveryb ody 
away
 t
o 
an am munition
 
f actory, to Skarzysko .  I was lef talone in the f ield. I went 
t o a f arme r.   
Andhe said t
o m e:  T
here areafew people left in town to clean up the ghetto. If  you wantto, 
I ' ll b
e taking you thereone day.  I
 
stayed with thefarmer maybe three,f our days.  Andthen he 
tookm eto that ghetto,em pty.  Nobody there
, o
nly the buildings.  I sneaked in. And I worked 
over there cleaning the ghetto.
 
 
And then the Germ ans tookus away to a town, a city called Radom .  In Radom, the 
previous people werealready taken to T reblinka,butthere was m aybe about 500people lef t in 

th e  gh etto
; i
nf luential peop
le, rich people
, y
ou know, thepeople who had money tobuy every
 
day their life. But Germ ans planned to kill us anyhow.
 
 
So what happened,one day
 
--
 
tell you a story what happened in Radom. T hey 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

12
 
announced
 
--
 
the Germ ans announced thatthey wanted to exchange Germ an prisoners, 
Germ an prisoners
 
--
 
the British locked up Germ ans in Palestine. This was 1942. T hey wanted 
to exchangef rom  Jews for the Germ ans. So whoever has m oney couldbuy his life to be an 
exchangef or a Germ an prisoner. 
 
 
T here were a lot
 
of doctors and lawyers, some people withm oney in Radom . They 
cam e out. The Germans cam e in with a bus,a big truck
, a
 
Red Cross.  And they go and take 
all the Jewish peoplewho want to be exchangedf or the Germ ans. 
 
T hey didn'tdo it. T hey 
took them  to the cemetery and killed them . They tookeverything a way f rom  them, their 
m oney, their treasures, everything.  I didn'thave any m oney, soI couldn't beexchanged.So 
lucky I survi ved.  T hey took them  to the cemetery.  T hey already dig a grave and they 
k ille d  
t h em  t he r e
; 
shot them all.  And I was there. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  David f rom  Radom  you were taken toPionki, right? 
 
>> David Bayer:  There was a f actory, 
amm unition
 
factory, in our area between Radom  and 
Kozienice. T he Germ ans took it over eventually.  T hey wanted slave labor. Sothey keep 

com ing to the ghettos to whatever, people they could get to work in thefactory. 
  
I volunteered 
to go to Pionkif rom Radom.  Butevery tim e Iwent to the truck, they didn't want to takem e
 
b
ecause I didn't have no
 
luggage. T he soldiers who were dri ving t he truck
:  W
hat do you 
have?  Nothing? T hey didn'ttake me.
 
 
So there was a couplein Radom ,af riend ofm ineand his wif e. T hey were friends of 
m y f ather. T hey didn't want to take old people
, o
nly wanted to tak
eyoung.  T hey com e over to 
m eand give m e two bundles
 a
nd also their son. And the Germ anstookus.

>> Bill Benson:  David, the signif icance of having the luggage or thebundles was that you had 
som ething they could take.
 
>> David Bayer:  Thepeople give
 
m e the two bundles.  Inever knew what was inside.  Didn't 
need to. T hey knew they were going to kill them  so they gave it to m e.  I tookthe bundle. The 
Germ ans took itaway.  I didn't know what was inside. Then I worked in the 
am
m unition factory 
in  P
ionki.T he Germ ans taughtm e tomakepowder f orbullets.  For two years I was work ing 
there. I was anexpert, practically.  I was ver y good inthat.  But thegases and the chem icals 
are killing us. W e didn't have goodfood. W e didn't wear nom askswhere I worked, that 
department.
  
S o a  l ot
 
--
 
it was ver y bad.  My gl ands swell upa lotof  tim es. 
  
 
 
And then the Russians were advancing andbeating the Germ ans. The Germ ans 
were losing the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you go there, talka little bitm orebefore your tim eatPionki. Tell us 

about inorder to get enough to eat, youhad to do bartering and smugglin g.  How did 
you 
m anage?
 
>> David Bayer: W etook a chance. W e worked with civil ians. T he Polish people went tothe 
factory and wenthom e every d
a y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just like regular em ployees.
 
>> David Bayer:  The job before the war, during the war. T he Germans paid them. They were 
experts. T hey were working in 
amm unition
 
factory.  They came every day to work.  T hey 
b r
ought lunch, sandwic hes, brought soup.  After a while the Germans gave us clothing 
f r om  
thepeople who they killed.  So we exchanged with the Polish people the clothingforf ood.

A lot of tim es,there was a supervisor working with m e.  Heasked me to cleana room  
where the Germ ans and the Polish supervisor s were sm ok

sm o
king, none of them survived.  Smokers never sur vi ved because they need the cigarettes 
ver y badly.  So they gave awa y their bread, soup, anythingf ora cigarette. 
 
 
I had a supervisor, he went to m y hometown, for am an who worked for m yf ather.W e 
had stocked up a lot of stuff  in our house, in his house.  He went there tobring me som ething,

I didn't need it. SoI gotfoodany wa y I can.

m e, there's an opening in the barbed wire and we could escape.  In theforest there'sPolish 
underground,f ighters against the Germ ans,and we could jointhem.
 
 
Sure

of  the supervisors to give m e another job.  Itwas ver y badfor me.  I couldn't breathe anym ore.  
So he gave m e a job in a little locomotive to transf er

process stuff  to another departm ent. I 
worked with a Polish man together. It was ahot day.  He was fooling around with the 

locomotive.  Som e spark cam e out.  The whole locom otive blew up.  I got burned;
 
m y a r m s,

anym ore. There was no food.T here was noelectricity.  Didn't give us no f ood. Soeveryo ne

Oneday, one Germ an, we saw him  com ing into the gate

was a nice guy.  Ever ybody saw him , so they started stam peding.  He pulled apistoland shot 
a guy.  Shot in the crowd.
  
He was scared. They were running to him .  He thought they would 
attack him  or som ething because
 
everyone was running on top of each other. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In reality, they just wanted togo with him .
 
>> David Bayer:  Yeah.  But one shot
, k

bed. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you were beingf orced out of Pionki, you were able to get som efood by 

sneaking into tunnels, if I rem em ber right.  You snuck into som e tunnels.
 
>> David Bayer: W ell
,  
in Pionki, we were f ree. T he Germ ans werewaiting f or the train to take 
us som ewhere away.  So we were looking for
 
thebig complex, a lot of warehouses.  Andthey

pumps didn't work nom orebecausenoelectricit y.  Ever ything was knocked out. They got sick
 
eating cheese, no w

Finally, we dig in the ground. W e got som e water but alldirty water.  And I cooked up 
rice, m ade some p

Then the train came and tookus Auschwi tz. 
 
 
I will go back to Pionki.  No, to the ghetto.T here was a man

T reblinka.  He cam eto Pionki. Becausehis sister was working in Pionki.  Andhe came into 
Pionki, sneaked in through the barbed wire. He toldeverybody that theGermans killed 
ever ybody f rom  the transportf rom Kozienice toT reblinka.  Everybody called him  crazy.

Heescaped oneday and cam e to P

But when the

So then in them eantim e, they killed all the gypsies.  T hey ki

>> D a v

dignitaries cam e in and got m e andafew otherguys 
to work in the coalm ine.  So they tookus to a place, a concentration camp, a subcam p of 

Auschwitz.  It was about 15, 20
 
kilom eters awa y.  And I wentto work in a coal m ine.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that was extrem ely dangerous work.  Tell us what your quota was. 
 
>> David Bayer:  TheGerm ans
 
--
 
you have to produce18 wagonsof  coal.  18 little wagons of  
coal.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Perday.
 
>> David Bayer:  Per day.  If not, you could not get out.  Again andagain and again. 
 
T hef oodthey gave uswas ver y bad.  Hard work.  It was impossible.  A lot of us learned how 
to cheat.  So everybody had a tag with a number.  Hang up thenumber and how many coals.  
W e m an a ge d
 
to  switch .  I g
ot somebody else's coal.  Putm y

And then there was one Germ an, a Nazi.  He was a Polish

he hit them over thehead. All theirbrains cam eout.  Killed hundreds ofpeoplethere. 
 
A ls o

a Polishm iner,a Polishpatriot. He was a nicem an.  He'sthe one wh

--
 
>> David Bayer:  Oh,ok.  W e worked, about eight guys to a group. A lot of groups, all over the 

m ine.  If one died, thenext day there's somebody else. Sothey got a young man whosenam e 
was Ruben.  He was f rom  Poland,a big town.  He was m aybe16,17.  He was a very reli gio us 
guy.  T hat'sall he did
, c
ontinually praying. We also calledhim  crazy. T hat's all he did.  Allhis 
mu
m bling,m um bling in Hebrew
 f
rom m emory.  He was a religious fanatic.  And he sticks to me 
like glue.  Everywhere I went, I worked.  He tried to helpm e. He picked up the coal with the 
hands. T he shovel we  got were 10
 
kilos, very heavy
, b
ig one. 
 
 
So he was always pra ying.  Butthis Polish m iner, oneday he told us, " E

you to move, silently, Idon't wantnobody tohear,m ove."   From thearea where he works.  
Oneday theGermanscom e in andhe was working, checking the walls.  And the Polish
 
m iner 
gestured to usbeforewe could move away f rom thearea.  And thePolishm iner pushed the 

buttonand blow up the German to pieces. The whole wall, the whole ceiling f all down on him  
and covered him  up. 
 
Ruben cam eover to me and said to me,

>> Bill Benson: W emay talk about

>> David Bayer:  Ruben lives in Jerusalem . He has11 children.  He is a rabbi teaching 
Hebrew.  He's still alive.  He was 4 years younger than I am .  I'm  91.  He's still in the80s. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  A youngster.  
 
 
In January, suddenly you're
 
brought outof  the coal m ines early and told youhave to 
leave.
 
>> David Bayer:  A lotof times we went to the m ine working.  A lot of tim es we went by train.  
T he Germ ans
,  
when we cam ehom ef rom the m ine, the camp where we li ved, toldus to go 
take a sho

January.  Cold. W e had to runf rom  thebarracks to the shower in the m iddle of the camp, 
icicles all over.  A lotof people run and theGerm ans rush you. They die. They froze to death. 
 
 
T hen theone day we c am e out of them ine. T he Russians were closer or they were

; t
hebom bardment.W e could hear them . T he Russians wer e very close.  T he 
Germ ans said evacuation

So we have tohook

And we had guards, hundreds

what happened to them  over there. They we re m urderers. They help

T hey were guards, shooters, killers, andeverything else.  And now they're nice people and 
they want f reedom and everything.  T hey didn't gi ve usf reedom  at all.  Very bad. T reatedus

[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  I justwant to make sure we get through what youwant to tell us about you 
during the war. 
 
>> David Bayer:  I™m  the one who don'tforgive.  Some people in this world f orgive, tolerance, 

this and that.  Iam nottolerant and Iam  notforgi ving.  T hat's whatI'm  going todie. So if I 
have to tell like it is, I tell it.  They were m urders. T hey were killers.  That'sthe way it is.

because Ruben was alwa ys next to m e.  Andhe was so

everybody to lie down.  Thousandsof  
thousands of people, m aybe 3,000, 4,000 people lie down
 
in the snow.  T hat's all you see, 
skies, dark spot in the snow, humans. W e were lying there.  No Germ an, no Ukrainian, 
nothing.  They all went in the houses to warm up

in the farm s.
 
 
I noticeda lotof dogs com e and going, com e and going

T here has to be som ething, f ood,m aybe. Sure enough Ruben starts scream and crying,

Ruben was kosher.  
You know what kosher is?  Heateall right.
 
[Laughter]
 
And I ate. W eall ate.  Chewed a piece ofm eat. And it helped a lot. It helped a lot.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And at one point, if I understand correctly, you were forced intoa barn 
and 
then they tried to set the barn onf ire. 
 
>> David Bayer: W ell, we slept a lot of places.  Letm e tell you som ething.  They wantedto 

rest so they tell us to rest, too.W e didn't warm  up, didn'teat.  Just lie down in the snow.  One

I don't know how thef ire started. But I thought later on that som ebody tried to kill him  with the

>> Bill Benson:  So 
a 
f ire got started.
 
>> David Bayer:  Andwe all
 
walked out and that's it.  The body burn

. That's it.  Andthen we 
keep walking.  I went to a place in Germ any,a concentration camp
 
where all theprisoners 
were already takenout.  There were some lef t, British, Russian prisoners,military m en

didn't getanything. T hey pushed them out. Keep on walking.
 
 
T he r e

pieceof  bread.  Hungry.  Ever yone was hungry
, t
erribl y hungr y.  People can't work nom ore.  
And there were Germ ans shooting, shootingall thetim e. 
 
T he y
 
broke into the warehouse.  I
 
broke into the warehouse with a bunchof  Russian soldiers.

>> David Bayer:  Russian prisoners. So in the warehouse I got in. All there was was 
m argarine
,  st
acks andstacks of margarine. That's all I got. I piled up margarine in my shoes, 
m y pants, wherever I can. I couldn'teven walk outanym ore.  And Igot a piece of iron like from  

a kitchen stove, you know.  I was thinking wh en I goout, all thepeople were robbing me 
because you were af raid to go in to get killed. The Germ ans would keepon shooting. 
 
A  lo t  o f  
people got killed running to the warehouses. I was lucky.  I don't know how I m anaged, but I 

d id
. 
 
 
I came into the warehouse
 
--
 
Im ean tom y barrack.  My f riends whowere working with 
m e, or on them arch, couldn't walk anym ore. Nobody wants to go.Ruben wants to go
.  
Ruben, me,and two Russian prisoners wentout to thebarbed wire andpeople line up behind 
m e.  Everybody pushing, pushing, wants to get out. If  I wanted to go back, I couldn't because 
ever ybody was pushing.  Fall down in a ravine. T hen we walked through theforest. 
 
Ruben couldn't walk anym ore because he got a bulletor som ething.  He was bleeding.  He's 

like, " I cannot walk anym ore."  So we put him in afarm barn. Me and the two Russian

>> Bill Benson: T hat's how you got back to the coal m ines? 
 
>> David Bayer:  If  I would have stayed longer in the clinic, after the operation, after 
recuperating, they send me to Auschwitz and gas m ebecause they didn't wantno witnesses.  
But I am  a witness. I am  here. I am  alive. T his is one in am illion. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You just recently saw this.  Right?
 

>> D a
vid Bayer:  Just three years ago. Steve went to Germ any.  He know m y name,my story, 
ever ything else.  It hithim right away.  Papers here. I gotthe copies. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  David, in our rem aining tim e,you're in the woods hiding with thetwo Russian 
prisoners of war. W hen were you liberated? W hen did know you were liberated? 
 
>> David Bayer: W e were staying in thef orestf or a long time. W ehad nofood anym ore. W e 

hadnothing. W e were digging under the snow to lookf orm ushroom  roots. W eate som e bark 
in the pine trees. W e couldn't stay anym ore. W e were dying.  I couldn't walk anymore.  So we 
walked out. And the Russians were there
.  W e
 
walked out. T he Russians were standing wi th 
guns. T hey didn't know who we were.  A Russian pickedm eupand carriedme like a 

package. I weighed maybe 60, 70
 
kilo s.   I wa s skin n y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were half of  youroriginal weight.
 
>> David Bayer:  I couldn't walk.  I wasf rozen.  Everything was f rozen. 
 
So they tookm e toa 
house with a Germ anwom an lived with her daughter.  They toldher to take care of me. Going 

to check out of me. The Germ an wom antook care of me. She was af raid of the Russian

I didn't care.  Musthave been her husbandor somebody.  They wer e not there. They were in 
the Arm y or who knows
, m
aybe killed. Butthe daughter was a young wom an.  But she was 
sloppy, dirty.  T he reason she was sloppy and dirty, didn't want the Russians to rap
e  th em  or  
som ething. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  At som epoint you would make your way back toKozienice.
 
>> David Bayer:  I went back. W hen I got recuperated, the wom an,by cooking all kinds of 
food.  But she didn'thave m uchfood.  If she had a lot,I would have been dead.  I wouldhave 
grabbed it.  But she didn't have it.  Shem ade soups, bathedm e, gave m e clothing.  I realized it 
was her clothing.  It was notform en.  It was wom an clothing. 
 
 
T hen I wantedto go.She said stay longer, stay longer.  I didn't. 
 
I had to go.  I worked 
the highwa y back to Poland.  T housands of  people going from  all directions back hom e.  I had 
no home. I cam e home toPoland. Nobody there.  I knew nobody would be there
, b
ut you 
want to go back to your own place.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdid youf ind in Kozienice?
 
>> David Bayer:  I didn'tfindnothing there.  My house was a 5 and 10 store.  T he Pol whogot 

it, he was begging m e.  He said,

Poland.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Besides the house
,  
he had furniture and fam ily belongings
 t

yo u r  f a m i l y.
 
>> David Bayer: W ell, I had a lot of Polish clothing hidden with the Polish man who usedto 
work f or m yf ather.  My father builthim a house and everything else. He was a 
nice m an.  I
