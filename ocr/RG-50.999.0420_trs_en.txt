this map of  
Europe points to Czechoslovakia.  In 1931 Erika, her sister and parents moved to the province of 
Bukovina, thehom eof Erika's paternal grandparents.  Our secondarrow points to Rom ania.

Erika's father, Ephraim, poses here with the studentsof  the StanestiHebrew School, whichhe 
founded.  Erika, Beatrice and Ephraim  are inthis photo. T he circle is Erika and herf ather is in the 
m iddle atthe very top.  I can put the arrow, you will see that'sErika's father right there.  
 
 
Erika also attended public school. Here we see a group portrait of the Neumanfam ily in 
a 
garden. Seatedf rom lef t to right are Erika'sgrandm other, Faige Pessia Neum an, her great 
grandm otherand Abraham Neum an, her grandf ather. Standing left to right are Max Neuman,and 
her parents, Dolly Geller Neum anand Ephraim  Neuman. 
 
 
In 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the province of Bukovina, including the town of  Stanesti.  A 
year later, when Rom ania joined Nazi Germany, the Soviets were driven f rom  Stanesti.  In thefall of  
1941, the Neumans were f orced to settle inthe Czernowit z ghettowhere the living conditions were 
poor andthe Jews wer e subject to deportation toT ransnistria. Here we see the off icial identif ication 
card bearing a large yellow star issued by theCounty Off iceof  the Jews of Cernauti to Erika Newm an 
authorizing her to remain in Cernauti, rather thanbedeported in 1942.  
 
 
Here we see Erika reading a magazine in the Cernauti ghetto.  In 1943, Erika and her sister 
Beatriceescapedf rom the ghetto onf alse papers that theirf atherhad obtained.  After escaping tothe 
S o vie t  Un io
n,Erika and Beatrice returned toCzechoslovakia where  they were eventually r eunited 
with their parents.  
 
 
W eclose the slide presentation with this wedding portraitf rom Erika's wedding to Robert 
Kauder, an officer in the Czech arm y, on August 28, 1945. 
 
Erika would have two children. She 
eventually im m igrated to the United States in1960.  Although Erikawas not able to resume her

>> Bill Benson:  Erika, thank you som uchf orbeing here today, being willing to beour 
F i rs t P e rs o n
.  
You have som uch to share with us ina shortperiod, so we'll just start right awa y, if  you don't m ind. 
You were born in Czechoslovakia, but your f am ily m oved toa sm all town in Rom ania whenyou were 
ver y young.  In1940 Rom ania was occupiedby the Russians.  In 1941, when you were just 13,the 
Germ ans enter Rom ania which forever changed yourf am ily's lif e and your community.  
 
 
Bef ore we turn to thewar years, tell us a little bitabout yourf am ily and your lif ebefore war 
began.  
 

>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
W em oved to Rom ania because m y grandf atherm arrieda Rom anian lady, and my 
father was f rom f ive brothers,and oneof  thebrothers was killed inthe Fir
st W orld W ar, and m y f ather 
was shot very badly.  The other three went toAm erica.  
 
 
W hen we came there,before the Holocaust started, we hada very good life.  My grandfather 
hada cow, ahorseand chickens, andI was a little girl, but I was alwa ys with
 
the chickens.  He put 
m ethere and gave m e a littlebag, and I had to take all of the eggs and not to break one.  Iwas ver y 

good.  I didn't break not one egg.  
 
 
Lifefor me was ver y good.  My sister, she was wonderful. She wasa wonderf ul daughter. I 
was not a wonderful daughter. I really andtruly loved m y grandf ather, andmy f atherdid not agree 
with what m y grandf ather thought.W hen I wouldask him  what's going to happen when I'llbe in 
schoolandthe boy will try to hurtm e.  He said, that's no problem . Oneboy hurts you, you hurtthree.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas your grandfather? 
 

>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
My grandfather, of course.  I couldn'tdonothing just like that. W hen I came home 
andI told m yf ather what grandfather toldme, hedidn't like
 
it at all, and he gave m e a long lecture.

I couldn't understand why he didn't like that I couldhit threeboys instead of one.  I got a long 
lecture.  Myf ather loved to give lectures,andI got a long lecture.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You described yourself
 
tome asa wild duck.  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Yeah, that's what I was.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's what you were?  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :
 
I was.  I was a wild duck, and I, when the Holocaust started, I was never home, and 
thef irsttim e when I went out Inever had any ID. W ehad ID,all, and I just walkedout.  Iheard m y 

m other talk toherf riend, and tell them thatmy f ather has af riendand he was a priest,andshe told 
thef riend. I heard it.  I rem em ber it very well.   I hadnoproblem . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you go there, if  you don't m ind, you were under the Russiansfor abouta 

year?  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Yes, that's true.  In Romania about thef irst year, and we were under the Russians.  
I didn't speak Russian, butthey were a year there,and we hadto go to school. I couldn't read, but I 

could speak Russian. I don't know how I learned it.  
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:  But you did?  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
I did.  I could speak it, butotherwise, I wasn't really a good girl at all.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In 1941, then, that's when the Germ ans cam e in.  
 
>> Erika Eckstut:TheGerm ans cam e in,and that was really ver y bad tim
e .  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what happened whenthey f irstarrived.  You've described ittom ebef ore. 
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
It's really not to be able todescribe it. W ho could describe?  Imean, I wasn't
 
--
 
I 
never wore any ID onm e.  Nobody canf igure out who I was.  But Ido have blueeyes and m y hair

now is ver y li ght, but it usedtobeblonde. In them eantime,I had cancer and all,I didn't have any 
hair, then it started growing and growing all white.  
 
 
So when I
 
--
 
when they came, I spoke Germ anf luently.  I hadnoproblem  with the Germ an, 
either. I never told anybody anything aboutmyself , that I'm  Jewish or whatever.  Doesn'tmatter. 
Nobody knew. T hat went on for quite a while, and
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Erika, soonaf ter the Germ ans arrive, your f am ily cam e very close tobeing m urdered.  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Absolutely.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right away.  T ell us what happened.  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Youknow, m y f ather was, by prof ession,a lawyer.  He was workin g and in charge 
of  t he  pe op l e .  A n d 
when the Russians camethey went af terhim  like he was the biggest
 
--
 
what do 
you call it?  Biggest against the Germans. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was so prom inent, they were af ter him ?  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Right, they were af ter him .  They really and truly, when they got him, hewalked 
with a cane.  I walk now with that, andI can'twalk ver y well. W hy Iwalk with the wagon, Iam  very 

proudof  it.  Ihad, really and truly, helpedm y father. W e were in the ghetto, and then we were 
supposedto go to theconcentration cam p. There was a train designated to take us. W hen we went 
there,m yf ather thought he saw somebody he knew, and he waved.  As soonas he waved, a soldier 
cam e, was com ing,I don't know if  he hada stonethere or whatever, he went straighttom y
 
fa the r.  
Bef ore he was there,I was on top of m y father.  My f ather was down, I was on top.  
 
 
I got the beating, which I rem em ber until today.  And what itdid tom e, that I couldn't really

walk ver y well.  I had to end up with that thing, 
wh i c h
 
I hold on. I try not touse it, but I can't really 
walk.  Now I'm  a little younger, you know.  It's harderand harder.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you get younger?  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
As Iget younger.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Erika, oneof  thethings that Iknow
 
you want tomention is soon after theGerm ans 
cam e in, you weref orced with your fam ily to go toa place where they had gathered allof  the Jews in 
the comm unity.  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Ye s .   
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what happenedthere. 
 

>> E rika  E ckst u t
: 
 
Youknow, we were f orced, whatever we did we didn't do on our own. We were 
alwa ys f orced to do this or todothat. T hey forced us to gotoa place where it wasn't really ver y good 

to go there.  
 
 
I have to justm ention my sister.  My sister was about almostf ive years older than me. She 
was a wonderful daughter, really wonderf ul. Shenever did what wasn't supposed to be done,and 
she just was a very, ve ry good child. 
 
 
I was never, never, ever a good child. I was not.W henever they cam e tohurtus
, if I cou ld  I 
would alwa ys be the one to protect them . Im ean,notthat I couldprotect them  really, but I did 
whatever I could. It was so bad that I rem em ber, I have a picture really, when I went with afriend of 
m y sister, and aboy who was 17, I was about 12or 13, I don't remem berexactly, andm y sister took 
a picture of us. W henshe took thepicture, whoever saw it was goin g af ter her, which was ver y bad,

because she couldn't do nothing to help herself . 
 
 
T hey were af ter her,and it was terrible, you know, the way
 
--
 
ever yt hing that happened was 
ver y, very bad.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Erika, oneof  thethings I know you've told m e about is when the Germ ansf irst came, 
they gathered everybody in af ieldand started shooting everybody, and you were able, you and your 
father were able to, and your fam ily were able to survi ve that.T hen your f ather was told to get out of  
town, and you moved. 
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Yousee, that was the tim e when thepolicem en who knew m y f ather very well told 
m y f ath e rth at h
e has to get out of the town, thathe will not survive i t.  You know, these peopledidn't 
like any Jews.  He was  a prom inentperson. T hey didn't likehim atall.  Notat all.W hen they said we 
hadto go,one of the policem en said they will takeus.  
 
 
Yo
u see,m yf ather and my grandmother 
c
ouldn't really walk.  My gr andm other wasn't around 
anym ore; shehad passed away.  My f ather really couldn't walk m uch.  He walked with a cane. T hey 
hada wagonf orm y gr andm other andform y father, but it didn'tdoa lot of good, because people 
were com ing.  
 
 
T hey killed people,I rem em ber all the children were also there,andthey killed the children.  It 
didn'tm ake a diff erence who you were.  It didn't matter if  you were 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, whatever you 
were, they just killed right and lef t.  Never botheredthem atall.  
 
 
T hat was also,at that tim e, they killed alm ostall m y f riends. I rem em ber when we were kids, 
12 years old, and they would say if  we survi ve , are you going totalkabout it?  I said I will talk to 
e
ver ybody who is goin g to listen.

Not everybody was a big talker.  I said I will talk, and I did.  As soonas I could,m y sister 
wouldn't talk to youf or nothing.  She never believed thatanybody would believe her when she said 
about this.  
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:  Af ter you were able to survi ve thef irst tim e they were killing ever ybody in your 
comm unity, eventually you and yourfam ily wo uld bef orced into the ghetto.  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  Ye s.  
 

>> Bill Benson: T ell us aboutbeing in the ghetto.  You started to
 
tell us about the name of the priest 
that youhad, andthat was ver y im portant toyour survi val too.  So
 
--
  
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
That was ver y im portant too,f orus to survive all together.  
 
 
W hen Ifoundout thatm y f atherhad af riend, and I knew his nam e,I went where they wer e 
selling f ood.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're in the ghetto,but you're able to go intothe town?  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
That was against the law to get out of the ghetto.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You just did it?  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
I  j u s t 
got out.  Nobody ever stoppedm e or nothing.  I went there andI bought 
whatever I could. W hen it cam etopay, I said,f ather, whatever his nam e was, wil l pay.  I had a 

wom an who Im et during m y trip there.  I cannotforget hernam e. The priest's nam e I'
ve f orgotten.  A 
lot of other names I've forgotten.  But I can'tforget that name, because I had a run
-
in with the police.  
T he f irst tim e when I went out and I bought the f ood and I cam e home, my m other f ainted because 
she realized I wasn'thom e.  She cou
l dn ' t fi nd m e.   
 
 
My f ather, when he saw m e, he said" How did you pay?"

I said" I didn't wantto
 
--
 
I didn't want to really lie tom y father, because if  you lied youhurt the person.  
I said," Iheard som ewhere that youhave af riend.  I thought if  Iused his name,m aybe I can get the 
food."  Because I didn't have any money.  Hesaid " I know you didn't. W here did you hear that I had a 
f r i e nd ?"
 
I said," I can't remember."  He said" You have to remember.  You're a little kid. W hydon'tyou 

rem em ber?"
 
I  s a id
," Idon't know why I can't rem em ber."   
 
 
No m atterhow m y f ather asked me, I couldn't rem em ber.  He said"T hat'sf ine. W e'll go 
tomorrow, and you tell m e what youdid."  
 
 
Next day, m y f ather said now you're going togo, and you're going to tell him that
 
you used a 
name when youbuy food. I went, when I cam ethere before
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T his was a store that sold topriests and nunsonly, right?  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Yes.  That's right. W hen I cam e there, before I even
 
--
 
he asked m e anything, I 
wa s
 
already cr ying, becauseI knew I did wrong.  I was ver y upset thatfather was so madatm e. He 
said "W hyare you crying, little girl? W hat's wrong"  I said, "I did something very wrong.  I used your 
name andI boughtfood, and I went again and I used it again."   Henever said nothing, soI didn't 
think it was sobad.  But there was a sign outside that if they wouldfind a non
-
Jew helping a Jewish 
fam ily, they and theirfam ily will be killed.  My father didn't want to have anything to do with that.  

W ould n
'thave him killed because I wanted som efood. ButI didn't know any better.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  He told you, the priest told you, it was OKto continue doing this?

He said " You cando it every day, as long as youwant.  But don't talk
 
about it.  
Don't tellanybody what you are doing."  But he said, " You cando itas muchas you want."  And Idid 
it.  I did itm aybe a year.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wantyou to tellone other, if you wi ll tell one otherthing that you shared with me 
b ef o r e,  
and that is the tim e you'd slipped out of the ghetto to getf ood and you cameacrossa soldier. 
T ell us what happened.  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
He didn't know, of course, that I'm  Jewish.  
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .  
 

>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Hewanted to know wh y I bought whatever Ibought. W hen I startedtotell him , I 
don't really rem em ber exactly what happened, but he wantedto know who I am .  Ididn't really want to 

tell him the truth, who I am.  
 
 
It was a terrible thing which happened. 
 
But I can't really and truly rem em ber exactly what 
happened,but it was a terrible thing. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I was thinking of  thetim e when you cam eacross this German soldier beating an 

elderly Jew, and you, as a little girl, and hereyou're outside the
 
ghetto and you jum ped into the

Yes.  I would tellhim , you're going to get into a lot of  trouble. T he man is

I  re a lly

I sa id , 
"W ho cares what he is?  He's bleeding."   You know, " You'll get in trouble with the police."  
 
 
At thatm om ent a mancam e over, and he said, "OK, little girl, tim e to get home."

Oh, no.

TheJews did not live in the house. They lived in the ghetto.
  
W e cam e there, and I

She said tom e" I toldyou once, I told you twice, home andhom ework."   She said it againandagain,

>> Bill Benson:  Erika, tom ake sure you heard the question, because you speakf requently and have, 
does it get easier totalk aboutall the terrible things you experienced or is it every tim e youtalk about 
it, it's justas painf ul as it was bef ore?  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Youknow, as soon asI could retiref rom m y job, Icam e here, and since thenI 
cam e here to the museum  every week, and Ialwa ys spoke. If  notat them useum, outside the 
m useum .  AndhereI have really the girl who usedtodo itthis yearwith me too.  
 
 
It's not easier totalk about it, because I don't keep anythingf orm yself.  Itell you anything, that 
it was bad, it'snotthe truth, it was worse.  I don't give you as bad as it was.  
 
 
So it's noteasier to talk about it, def initely not.  But I liketo talk, andI likef or everybody tohear 
it, and I would like thatyou shouldbelieve that every word I say is the Godhonesttruth.  Maybe I 

don't say it as strong as I should,but everythi ng I say is true.  
 
 
Even worse than the way I say it.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Erika, your sister, who is now 90and living in Queens,
 
you said she chose not to 
speakabout it.  
 
>> E rika  E ckst u t :  
 
Shewouldn't speak to you for nothing.  She didn'tprom ise herf riendseither, and 
she wouldn't.  She can't believe that thepeople believe whatever she said.  
 
 
I have, over and over, I get letters,I have som any letters, and I have m y daughter here now, 
and she knows thatthe friends of m y husband cam e,and she put ever ything in order.  Not one letter 

got lost or whatever.  
 
 
I have every letter, every word anybody sentm e.  Ialwa ys answer back.  Now I have, since m y 
late husbandpassedawa y, it's ver y hard form eto rem em ber everything the way it was cl osely, andI

can't, really and truly, talk as well as I used to.  But Ido liketo talk to m ake sure that ever
ybody 
knows about it. It was as bad as bad could be.  
 
 
I happened tobe very lucky, because whoever I ever talk to, children or adults or whoever, 
they always believe me, and they wrote tome.  Ihave beautif ul
 
lettersf rom  kids oradults.
