J ill was  bor n Gis ela Renate Berg on May
 
1, 1933, in Cologne, Germany.  The arr ow on this  
m ap points  to the city of Cologne.  The fam ily lived in a near by s m all town outs ide of Cologne, 
Lec henic h.
 
 
J ill is  the little girl in the front of this  pic tur e.  Her e s he and her  older s ister Inge ar e in a pic nic  
in the Eifel m ountains  in 1937 with their mother, aunts , and unc le.  The Nazis  c am e to power s hortly 

before J ill was  bor n in 1933. 
 
 
On November
 
9, 1938, the Nazis  c arr ied out a nationwide Pogr om agains t Ger many's J ews  
known as  Kr is tallnac ht.  Sometimes it's  r efer red to as  Night of Br oken Glas s .  This  is a his tor ic  
photogr aph s howing a s tor e window that was  broken on that night.
  
Alerted to the danger, J ill and her  
fam ily fled to Cologne dur ing the Pogrom.
 
 
J ill's  fam ily dec ided to 
em igr ate from Germ any and in 
May of 1939 they left for Kenya.  In this

[Applaus e]
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Good morning.  Am  I on?  I'm not on.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I think  you'r e on.
 
> > J ill P auly:  A little bit? 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Dave c an take c ar e of that.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Ok .  Now it's  on.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  All right.  J ill
, thank  you for joining us.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  You're welc ome.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  And for  your  willingnes s  to be our
 
First Per s on
 
a
nd for having m e as  your  hos t.  J ill 
and I have been fr iends  for a long tim e
 s
o it's als o very m eaningful to be her e with you.
 
 
Maybe we c an s tart with s omething about your  family and the town where you grew up.  Do 
you want to tell us about your  parents ?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  My m other and father, my gr andparents , m y unc le, m y father 's brother, and my s ister and 

I lived in one house in a s m all town c alled, as s he s aid, Lec henic h, whic h is  today part of a larger town 

in W
es tern Germ any.  It's  17
 
m iles  outs ide of Cologne.
  
The reas on they were living outs ide of Cologne 
is  bec aus e they were c attle dealers.  They had land and animals and, of
 
cour s e, they c ouldn't live in the 
hear t of Cologne.  But they wer e 
Orthodox
 
J ews .  And it would have been eas ier  for them  ins ide of 
Cologne, s o we wer e ver y c onnec ted to Cologne.
 
 
As  far  as my genealogical r es ear ch s hows  me, the family lived ther e for at leas t 400 years .  
Befor e that, we c an't find.  Somewhere in the 1600s . 
 
 
So when the Hitler times s tarted, ver y early on, before he was  elec ted
 
--
 
he was  elec ted in 
1933.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Yes .
 
> > J ill Pauly:  My par ents  were mar ried in 1928.  My sis ter was  bor n in 1929.  My father had employed 

a man who was  below average I.Q. and he did work for him in the c attle stables .  This  is 1929.  My  
s is ter was  about 6, 7 months  old.  One day he c am e to work and s aid to m y father , "Jos eph, if I wer e 
you, I would take this  wheel barr el and I would take m y wife and m y new baby and I would walk out of 
this  plac e as far  as  you can go until you'r e out of the c ountr y."
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Alr eady in 1929.
 
> > J ill P auly:  192
9.  So m y father s aid to him, "W
hy ar e you 
s aying
 
this  to me?"  He s aid, "W
ell, I was  
inv ited to one of thes e parties ."  He s ays  where they keep them down in the c ellar , wher e they dr ink  
beer .  
ﬁ
And they were talking about what they were going to do with you people.  And you s houldn't 
s tay here.
ﬂ  
>> Bets
y Anthony:  Wow.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  My father went into the hous e and told m y m other.  I'm quoting this  bec aus e this  is  the 

differ ence in people.  Mos t German J ews  s aid, "Ugh, he's  going to c om e and he's g
oing to go."  My  
m other  s aid, "C
hi
ldr en and fools  tell
 
the truth. W
e better lis ten to that guy."
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Wow.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Maybe it was  one of the reas ons I survived bec aus e at s ome point
 
--
 
it really s tr uck 
hom e. We were living under  c onditions
 
--
 
I r em ember when I go back  to Ge
rm any to vis it, it really  

3 
 
r evamps  m y m em or ies .  I lived mos t of the firs t
 
--
 
I was  born May
 
1, 1933.  So that was  four m onths 
after  Hitler c ame to power.  I lived m os t of my fir st five year s  in the hous e.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  And you r emember that tim e then?
 
> > Jill Pauly:  Yes .  I don't r emember when I was  2 or 3, but I r emem ber getting into a c onfr ontation 
with m y m other bec aus e I wanted to play in the bac kyar d.  I was  m is s ing the s uns hine.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Of c our se.
 
> > Jill Pauly:  And there was  a hay loft.  It was  a walled in bac kyar d with neighbors on the left who 
c ouldn't look  in and neighbor s  on the right who could look  in.  I was  4.  I wanted to play in the hay loft.  
She s aid, "N
o, you c an't go there."  I s aid, "
W
hy can't I go there?"  This  was  193
6, 1937.  It bec am e a 
big c onfrontation.  I r emem ber s c r eam ing.  And s he felt very badly, I think.  She took  m e ins ide and s at 

m e down and s he explained to me why s he was  afraid and why s he didn't want m e in the backyard
, 
b
ac k  there. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Wo
w.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  She was  afr aid of the teenagers  next door .  She was n't s ure that they were not par t of the 
Hitler  youth.  And they liv ed s uch a s ecr etive life, inward life. They didn't want anybody to know 
anything about what they did.  You know, that's
 
abnor mal.  It's totally abnor mal.  And childr en growing 
up in that environm ent s tar t r eacting.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  So you were alr eady feeling this  at home
, l
ong befor e the Kr istallnac ht.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Yes , yes , yes .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  How about your fat
her
 
--
 
in his profes s ion, did he feel
 
--
 
> > J ill Pauly:  My father got a letter .  I rec ently got a c opy.  I haven't had tim e to s ear c h for  it.  It's  

s om ewhere in m y papers
,  
two piec es  of paper.  Fir s t letter c ame J anuar y
 
1, 1937 infor ming him that 
they c ould not c ontinue in the bus ines s .  They had a very, very s uc c es sful bus ines s .  Ther e wer e four 
par tners  and m y grandfather.  My gr andfather was  retired.  And they tr aveled a lot.  They bought c attle, 
had it s hipped to Germany.  My father was  a s ales man.  It
 
was  a very big bus ines s .  And they had to 
s top.
 
 
We lived in a Catholic  c om munity.  They did have an underground of people who were 
anti
-
Nazi who tried to help.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Really?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  In fact, one of thes e people was  photogr aphed with one of my unc les  by a news paper .  
They were s tanding in the field near s om e c attle.  They wer e pr obably talking about c ows
, b
us ines s.  
And they s howed him  as a J ew lover in the news paper  bec aus e he was  standing ther e with a J ewis h 

m an.  It was  dangerous, very dangerous for non
-
Jews  to try to help us. 
 
 
This  went on c onstantly.  I never went to a park .  My m other 
u
s ed to have
 
--
 
when my s ister 
was  born, s he had what's called a
 
--
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  A nanny.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  A nanny.  But the law c ame out with
 
the Nurem berg Laws , no non
-
J ewis h young woman 
under the age of 45 was  allowed to wor k  for J ews .  So the nannies  went.  I don't r em em ber this but 

they tell me
 
--
 
m y s is ter told me and als o an aunt that there was  a 45
-
year
-
old woman who us ed to 
c om e in and help.  I don't rem em ber her.  She mus t have been very uninter es ting.
 

>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Jill Pauly:  As I say, when I go back, a lot of things click, click, click, click.  It's like a camer a clicking.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I bet. 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  I s poke to pe
ople, Catholic  people, who wer e c hildren.  I went back  two and a half year s  

ago, thr ee years  in October .  They had invited me to c om e back  to Lec henic h and s peak .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I'm  hoping to ask  you about that. 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  This woman remembers.
 
>
>  Bets y Anthony:  Oh, wow.
  
Great.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Bear ing witness .  I didn't have a c amera.  I didn't have s omething to r ecor d her.  She's  

five years  older than I.  She rem em ber s the m an that dr ove us  away.  We'll talk about that later. 
 
> > Betsy Anthony:
  
Not great, of c ours e.

> > Jill Pauly:  I never would have remem ber ed thes e things had I not gone back.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  It's  als o inter es ting to hear  your  story as you'r e r emembering it and not jus t a 
tim eline but as  you're r em em ber ing it.
 
 
I wanted to 
touc h on s om ething you s aid a little bit ago.  I think that your  family s hows , as  we 
m ove on with your s tor y, a lot of ins ight.  A lot of people
 
--
 
like your m other s aying in 1929 we s hould 
lis ten to that guy.  One example of that is  you told m e that your 
fam ily was  alr eady tr ying to get out of 
Germ any befor e the Kr is tallnac ht.
 
> > Jill Pauly:  I just learned that rec ently.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Can you tell us  what they were trying to do?
 
> > Jill Pauly:  It's a natural thing, norm al, natur al thing, when people
 
em igrate.  There are differ ent ways  
of em igr ating.  You either  c om e in the legal way without any press ur e, you do it bec aus e you want to do 
it.  And that's  how they wer e thinking.  I s hould get that out.  They were not thinking that they were 
going to be 
pus hed to do what they did.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I s ee.
 
> > J ill P auly:  It s ort of
 
--
 
Kr is tallnac ht
 
--
 
I know my mother s aid m y father looked around, all of 1937, 
wher e we c ould get in.  He s aw that the quota number s for  the United States , we wouldn't get ou
t in 

tim e.  He wanted to get out s ooner .  But always  in his  mind, knowing m y late father  ver y well, was  
s upporting a fam ily of s even people.  Don't forget, by the 1st of J anuary
 
1938, everything he owned 
was n't his  anym or e.  He got a letter  that his  pr operty and whatever  he had was  now belonging to the 
s tate.  So that was  s omething that held him back m aking a living.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Certainly.  He was  looking.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  They wer e looking.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You've told me before that des pite the Nuremberg Law agains t it your  family k ept 
kos her  dur ing this  time.  Can you tell us how? 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  There was  an awful lot of s tuff that was  very defiant but they als o knew about 

Buc henwald bec aus e the c am ps  wer e opened three m onths after I was  bor n.  But s om ehow 
ps yc hologic ally that was for other people.  You know?  They never  c onnected that if they got c aught 
doing what they wer e doing, psss t.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Even then.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Then.  When the laws  c am e out that they c ould not do anymor e ko
s her  s laughter ing
 
--
 
one of the unc les  was  a butc her and did the s
laughter ing and sold the m eat. Th
ey dec ided they were 
going 
to 
c ontinue.  They did it anyway.  They took  the c alves  and the c hick ens  to the attic  in my hous e.  
They hid the s pec ial knives, whic h ar e ver y s pec ial.  They have to be k ept properly.  My unc le decided 

to str ap them on the ins ide of the c himney bec aus e they wer e 
r aided
 
twic e.  Som ebody gave them 
away.  They don't know who but s omebody did. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Really?
 
> > J ill P auly: 
 
I don't think  they provided other  people with kos her m eat.  You c ouldn't tr ust your  own 
br other.  A neighbor  c ould s lip and tell s om eone som ething.  So s omeone.  But the knives  wer en't 

found. Whatever els e they did, I don't know.  But they did plenty.  
 
 
They s ent the money out of the c ountry, not legally.  They hir ed thr ough a c onnec tion in 
Holland who hir ed this per s on for them .  My grandmother  ins is ted that fam ily money be taken out of the 
c ountr y the day I was  bor n.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I'm  wondering, is this  leading to 
G
old
s
c hmidt?  Do you want to tell us  about him and 
how your  family knew him? 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  The oldes t of the partners was  m yUnc le J os eph.  He had no c hildr en.  He was  the 
wealthies t of the fam ily.  He took  his  wife on vacation every y
ear  to the mountains .  I don't know whic h 
m ountains.  I presum e the Germ an mountains .  I know it was a kos her hotel its elf.  It c ould have been 

Aus tria.  Maybe Switzer land but I think  it was  Germ any.  This man was  there, this  is Golds c hm idt
,  
and 
they got t
o k now eac h other , bec am e very friendly.  And when things  got really hot, Mr .
 
Golds c hmidt 
was  willing to help.  He or c hes tr ated the sm uggler getting the m oney out of Germ any.  The s muggler 

was n't c aught.
 

5 
 
> > Betsy Anthony:  Wow.
 
> > Jill Pauly:  I k now they did it on the day I was  born bec aus e one of m y unc les  was  as s igned to follow 
the sm uggler and he, my unc le, was  c aught at the
 
--
 
what do 
you 
c all
 
--
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  The bor der.
 
> > Jill Pauly:  The border.  They s ent him back.  He c alled and told his  s ister that, you know, he couldn't 
m ake it, they c aught him and s ent him back .  She told him that I was  born.  So he c ame to Cologne to 

look at me.  And then he c ontinued and went over  the bor der  s om ewhere els e.
 
 
You know, the bor der to our fam ily was  fungibl
e bec aus e they lived r ight on the border .  My 
mother's family.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Between Ger m any and
 
--
 
> > J ill Pauly:  And Holland, yeah.  Many years  later  I went back .  I wanted to s ee the town of 

Maas tr icht
.  It was  15, 20 m inutes by bic yc le from where
 
m y m other  lived.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  So r eally c los e.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Yes .  So for  them to be locked out of Holland was  a terr ible thing bec aus e they did a lot 
of bus ines s there.  They had a lot of pr obably rent and land ther e.  Some unc les  lived there. 
 
>
>  Bets y Anthony:  So it would be like Mar y land and Virginia.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Exactly. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  It's  im portant for  Am er ic ans to have a r efer enc e s om etim es.
 
> > J ill P auly:  It was  not like 
drive five

m inute m iles  to get there, but my hous e to I th
ink  it's

Holland fr om  wher e we lived, was  one hour by c ar.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You wer e jus t 5
 
1/2 years old when this  horr ible night, the night called Kr is tallnac ht 
happened.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Yes .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You have s ome c lear memor ies  from that night. Would you s har e them?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Yeah.  For s om e r eas on that day
 
--
 
ear ly in the morning we wer e s itting in an ups tairs  
r oom near the fr ont door, the living r oom.  And I think it was  Novem ber.  It mus t have been c old.  My 
grandfather put on a little s tove in the living room.  So I was  in there with my grandparents.  There was  
a knock  on the door at 9:00
 
in the mor ning.  It was  a friend, a r ighteous gentile.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You're c overing your  mic.  Ther e you go. 
 
> > J ill P auly:  Sor
r y.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  That's  ok. 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Telling my father not to go to s ynagogue that day.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  A non
-
J ewis h fr iend.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Non
-
J ewish fr iend.  And m y father s aid
, ﬁW
hy?
ﬂ
  
He didn't k now anything.  It was  going 
on in other
 
c ities .  He didn't know.  It was n't publicized.
  
So the man s aid, "I don't know what's  going to 
happen.  J ust lis ten to me and don't go."  
 
 
Well, that was  a s ignal, of c our s e.  They s tarted making phone c alls .  And the phone started 
r inging fr om relative
s  where it was  happening.  And als o r elatives  where it was  not happening, we 
s hould c om e there.  It was  a whole big terr ible upheaval in the hous e, s cr eaming.
 
 
My gr andmother dec ided we had to get out.  We're leaving.  And you know, when you think 
about th
at, wher e do you run to?  She dec ided we wer e r unning into the c ity.  And I r ead about that in 
log book s , that the J ews  in Germ any, when the pres s ur e built in their  little towns , whic h it did, they 
m oved to the c ities  s o they would be les s  vulnerable.  People wouldn't k now them  is  as  well.  Of c our s e 
that didn't wor k  but
 
--
 
s o that m ust have been the idea my gr andm other got, r un into Cologne and we'll 
s eparate and dis per s e and they won't find us.  So that's what we dec ided to do.
 
 
There was  s o m uch s c r eam ing in the hous e.  By the time we all got in the car
 
--
 
and my 
father called this  man that he knew well who s aid he would take us .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  A non
-
J ewis h fr iend.
 
> > J ill P auly:  Non
-
J ewish fr iend.  Inge had gone to Cologne, my older s ister.  She was
 
four year s  olde
r.  
She took  the train to Cologne ever y day to J ewis h s c hool. We c ouldn't go to s c hool at the loc al schools  
bec aus e of the anti
-
Semitis m.  She c am e back at 9:00.  And m y m other s aw her .  And when s he c am e

hom e
 
--
 
the train went by our house and she saw her  on the train.  She said, "
W
hat ar e you doing 
her e?"  She s aid, "
W

J ill Pauly:  Not all of us .  J ust m y s is ter, the grandpar ents.

--
 
the minute we got outs ide the hous e we s tarted to get ter rorized.  
We wer e s cr eaming like c r azy.  We wer e s o terrorized.  There was  s moke and floating stuff.  And it 
was n't
 
--
 
what it was , they had already s et the s ynagogue on fir e. We s m elled the smoke
 a

flam es.  And when c hildren see fire, they s c ream.
 

> > Bets y Anthony:  Sure.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  We were terr or ized.  So my gr and
m other  put us in the c ar with our fac es down.  My  
grandfather put his  feet on m y s is ter  and s he put her feet on m e.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  On the floor.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  On the floor . We c ouldn't get up.  She figured that would quiet us down and it did.  

Eventually s he
 
--
 
s he didn't want us  to s ee out the windows .  She mus t have rec ognized that ther e wer e 
going to be other  fir es.  So they kept us down.  And when we got near  Cologne, we did s ee fir es in the 

dis tanc e.  I r em em ber dr iving into Cologne, getting out of the c ar, and everything was  gr ay.  It was  gray.  
The hous es  were gr ay.  It was n't s unny.  And the flags  wer e gorgeous , the Nazi flags.  I had never seen 
one.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Wow. 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Big, red flags with long white m edallion, you know, agains t the gr ay.  I r emem bered that.  

I rem ember that.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Very impres s ive for a little gir l.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Yes .  And I als o liked the Nazi mus ic .  I didn't hear  it very often bec aus e they m ade sur e I 

didn't but I loved m us ic .  It was
 
good mar c hing mus ic .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  That it was . 
 

> > J ill Pauly:  Yeah.  Children don't know thes e.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Of c ours e not. 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  And I have to s ay, they were ver y good about not emphas izing the Nazi c ruelty and fear  

m or e than the

> > Bets y Anthony:  Your par ents ?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  My family, yes .  They wer e c areful.  I think that's why they wer e s o

kept m e ins ide a lot.  
The les s  I knew, the better.

and s aw
 
--
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Oh, I had a lot to lear n but I was  a fas t learner.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I gues s  you lear n quickly in a s ituation like that.
  
In Cologne, wher e did 
you go?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  We went into an apartm ent r ented by m y m other 's aunts  and unc les , three unc les and an 
aunt.  They were r etir ed in Cologne.  They had to leave their  town bec aus e it was  really anti
-
Semitism.  
So they r etired to Cologne.
 
 
This  was  als o a whole s tory that I never  even m entioned at the m us eum.  This  unc le of my 
m other
's was  s o popular in that town that they made him
 
--
 
they had thes e s tr eet fes tivals .  I don't know 
if they're bas ed on religious
 
--
 
probably r eligious ly bas ed.  They mar c hed on the s tr eet, you know, a 
par ade.  And they m ade him  the king of the parade.  And he was  an 
Or thodox
 
J ew.  Ever ybody knew it.  
It was  a tiny town. 
 
When the Nazis  t
ook hold, this town vehem ently anti
-
Sem iti
c 
ear ly.  So they had to 
leave.  But they didn't go far enough.  They went to Cologne. 
 
> > Betsy Anthony:  I r ecall that you s aid before that onc e you got to Cologne and you piled into this  
apar tm ent with a lot of fam ily members , the men didn't stay ther e.

> > J ill P auly:  No.  No.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Why is  that?
 
> > Jill Pauly:  There were m en ther e, the unc les .  I have to give you th
e ages.  The unc les  
wer e
 
--
 
unc les of my parents , s o they were in their  late 50s  to 65, the three unc les
 a
nd the aunt als o.  
Somehow the older people
 
--
 
this was a fallac y
 
--
 
felt les s  threatened bec aus e they felt if they want to 
ar r est Jewis h men, they would go for  the younger men firs t, whic h was n't the c as e.  No.  That was  jus t 

s om ething they told them s elves .
 
 
So we get into this apar tm ent.  It turned from four people to 12 people.  There were no beds  
for Inge and I.  We m anaged to s leep.  I don't know how.  My m other's m other was  really s ick .  She had 
c anc er .  She was  bedr idden.  She was  brought in.  
 
 
And I bec am e ver y unhappy.  I was  just
 
--
 
I didn't unders tand a lot.  And they had to teac h 
m e.  The pr ess ure was  on now that I had to lear n this  stuff about how dangerous  life was .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Right.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  And, of c ours e, I bec am e unhappy.  I had
 
no c hildren to play with.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  In Cologne.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  In Cologne.  Exc ept ther e was  a little girl that moved in with her m other, als o under thes e 

c irc umstanc es.  And that s aved me bec aus e then I had a friend.  For the first time I reall y was  allowed 
to play outs ide of the family with a fr iend.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Even then this hor rible violence and terr ible vandalis m , killings
 
--
 
> > J ill P auly:  Yes .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Pus hed your fam ily, the final step.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Yes .  The men, 
unc les , all the m en in my c los e fam ily went into the woods .  They didn't 
go to Cologne.  They were afraid.
  
If you rem em ber, c ut this whole thing off at 10:00
 
the next mor ning 
after  Kr istallnac ht.  No mor e stealing, no mor e looting, no mor e anything.  So they didn't go home to the 
hous e ever  again, any of them .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Oh.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  They c ame into Cologne.  And thr ee of them
 
--
 m
y father, his  br other and a c ous in
 
--
 
they 
tr ied to stay one or two nights.  My father  went to the attic  in the building and took  us up ther e to liv e up 
ther e.  He was  going to try that, like Mr.
 
Fr ank .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  To try to hide.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  To try to hide.  And ver y luc kily
 
--
 
and my s is ter  had s cr eaming nightm ares.  So he really 
c ouldn't take a chanc e. 
 
So the next day he and his  brother  and a c ous in got in the c ar and drove into 
Holland without papers.  They wer e c aught.  They were put in pr is on.  And the two unc les  that wer e 

living in Holland s aw this  happening.  That's a whole s epar ate story, a difficult one.  But they s urvived.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  They c ertainly did.  They organized, under very diffic ult c irc um s tances , to manage 

to get your  fam ily out.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Oh my goodnes s .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Sever al months later, I think it was  May
 
1939
, yo
u 
and the Berg fam ily boar ded a 
tr ain and then a boat and s ailed for Kenya.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Yes .  The train was  very dangerous.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Really?  Why is that?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Exc es s ively danger ous.  Bec aus e it was  at the point wher e they wer e s epa
rating families .  

That was  a big joy of Nazis m.  My mother mus t have lear ned that being separ ated on the tr ain was  not 
unhear d of s o s he was  v ery frightened.  She s at m e down and s he explained this .  And I lear ned it. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Real quick . 
 
>> Ji
ll Pauly:  I internalized it. When I s tarted lear ning that I c ould be s epar ated fr om m y m other, I gr ew 
up, los t m y c hildhood.  I was  terr ified.  I mean, s he took  me to s c hool in Cologne for a week  or s o and 
s he was  s o ter rified that s he s topped taking me bec aus e s he was  afr aid when s he would pic k  me up 
that I wouldn't be there.  And s he got the paper s dur ing thos e day that we c ould leave s o s he didn't 
have to tak e me anym ore.

We left at the end of J une
 
on
 
the tr ain.  And her m other  who was  bedr idden with c anc er, s he 
was  as s is ted to the brothers , as s is ted living in the apartment

 m

M

Afric a on a s hip and you're s o s ick and it is  going to be ver y hot.  Ar e you sure you want to take this  
tr ip?"  And s he said, "
I
f I die on t
he train tomor row, I want to leave this  place."  That's why I'm her e.  
Bec aus e had s he stayed, m y m other would have had to take c ar e of her  with the two of us .  
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  And s he made it.  She m ade it to Afr ic a.
 
> > Jill Pauly:  Yes .  She had to be c ar ried all the way to the tr ain in Cologne.  There was  s om ething 
about that.  I don't k now if I've ever  told you.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You haven't told them.
 
> > Jill Pauly:  No.  She couldn't walk.  She was  too s ick.  She had to be c arr ied out of the house, into a 
c ar , into the tr ain.  The Nazis  had no us e for very s ic k  people who c ouldn't walk.  There was n't anyone 

c los e by who c ould c arr y her.  A m an c am e who had been in Dac hau for thr ee weeks and got out.  I 
s aw for  the firs t time wha
t that meant.  H
e w
as  gray.  His hair was  about, you know, s tubbly.  His  
c heek s
 
--
 
and he was  only there a month.  I gues s he got nothing to eat in that m onth.  He was  jus t s o 
gaunt and gr ay.  He frightened me.  That's  why I remember him.  He got out, too, eventually.
 
 
When 
we got on the train, m y mother told m e what was  going to happen.  We wer e going to 
be quiet. We were not going to fight at all. We could not ask  to go to the bathr oom.  And we c ouldn't 
be hungry.  Thos e wer e the r ules  in that c ategory.  And we were in with a sic k grandm other , m y m other, 

and two of us.  And we lis tened. We didn't talk.  We didn't m ove.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  And that was  bec aus e that portion of the tr ain journey was  s till in Naz i Germ any.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Oh, yes .  They cam e in to check our papers several tim es .  That's what s he was  afr aid of 
bec aus e they would s ay c hildren are not pr oper ly r ec or ded or s omething.
 
 
Onc e we got to Switzer land
 
--
 
it took  three and a half hour s.  My m other sm iled.  And I had 
never s een that.  I didn't think  I had ever  s een it other wis e why would I remember it this  way.  She was  

under s o m uc h str ess  in Cologne that ther e was  nothing to smile about at any point. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Right. 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  We got out.  And eac h J ew that got out of Germ any had to pay do
uble for  their tickets.  
And everything that we bought or  pack ed, they allowed that.  You c ould s pend all your money, buy 

things and have them s ent. When they got to Ham burg, half of them wer e s tolen.  The other half got to 
Kenya.  And eac h of us had like
 
what today is
 
$10, nothing els e. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You made it through this  tr ain journey.  You boar ded a s hip.  And you s ailed for two 

weeks ?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Two week s  on a Nazi s hip.  They had us  c ontrolled.  For
 
$10 a per s on, wher e ar e you 
going to g
o?  They had to pool the money to get a hotel room for  the night.  Mus t have been s ix people 
in the hotel r oom.  Where ar e you going to go?  Ther e was  no plac e to go agains t the Nazi s hip.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I want to make s ur e we keep moving along and talk  about Kenya but befor e we go 
to Kenya, c an you tell us the s tory about the c aptain who hear d you s inging on the s hip?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  Oh, yeah.  The bes t is  yet to com e.  You s aw that pic ture of us  on the s hip.  When I 
thought about it, and I've been thinking about it, I was  very happy bec aus e it was  lovely.  There was  
s uns hine and water.  But befor e we got to the s uns hine and the water , I have to tell you about my 
m other 's reac tion when we were put on the s hip, went on the s hip. 
 
 
All the J ews  were lower dec k , under the lower dec k , and hum anity was  up above.  And s he 
got furious .  But s he c ouldn't do anything about it.  I r emember s he got ver y angry.  And we had a lot of 
pr oblem s  on the ship.  It was  not s imple.  It was  not s im ple at all.  My little c ous in, who is  a donor here, 
he was  18 months old.  He was  a troublem aker.  He was  a c hild born in 1937.  His  mother never had 

tim e.  He was  into ever ything.  He alm ost fell into the oc ean.  Inge pulled him back .  His  favor ite thing 
was  lying

going on the
 
dec k  with the older  people sitting in deck  c hair s.  He would get underneath 
and kick them.

[Laughter]

him , the wor s

[Laughter] 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  As  I under s tood it, your  m om  was  afraid s he m ight need to s ubdue you bec ause of 
your  s inging. What was  that?

>> Betsy A

> > Jill Pauly:  My gr andmother  taught me to s ing.  You mus t r em ember, five and a half 
year s  in the 
house with a c hild, m y grandm other .  She was  fabulous .  She kept me happy.  She s ang with m e.  She 
s ewed with m e.  She danc ed with m e.  She c ook ed.  She was  totally attentive to m e.

I didn't s peak early.  I 
s ang ear ly.  So when I got on the boat, when I was  left alone, I s tar ted s inging.  Mm m.  I was  pic ked up 
by the c aptain.  He heard m e s inging.  He ask ed for m y m other to c om e and s ee him.  She was

the cr ew. Well, she c ouldn't s ay no
, yo

A problem ar os e, a big pr oblem .  My unc les  in Cologne who wer e ver y 
Or thodox
 
and ver y 
m us ic al s ang the whole Pas s over  Haggadah with m e, taught it to me in mus ic .  Pr obably what I was  

s inging.  It was  a month after Passover .  And I learned we were going to the red sea.  So this whole 
thing c am e to life.  I wanted to s ee the r ed s ea.  It didn't happen. 
 
My m other was  s o afr aid that I would 
s ing Hebrew s ongs.  So they took  m e to a c abin all night, the two gr andm others  and my m other  and an 

aunt.  They tried to s eparate the folk s ongs from  the Hebr ew songs .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  German folk s ongs.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  From the Hebr ew s ongs and told m e just to s ing thos e German folk s ongs.  And you 

know, I did.  I don't know if I under stood them or not.  But here I am.  Nothing happened.
 
 
I r em ember one night

and the lady that's  still liv ing

Ever ybody els e was  in the gar b of the c ountry.

. 
> > J ill Pauly:  Well, it's  very c om plic ated for  m e to really explain how we wer e s o lucky and had the

s upported the s even people that wer e there who c ouldn't work, whic h is  a whole different history.  
When we got the perm iss ion to get into Kenya, eac h pers on that was  taken in you had to pay 50 Britis h

She s uffered ter r ibly.  But now we know why. 
 
The s is ter had

what's it called?  Epileps y.  T

> > Bets y Anthony:  What did you do?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  With the money that was  left, they pooled it.  They c ouldn't buy a farm and pay for  it.  
They didn't have enough left.  They put a downpaym ent on a farm , a big farm.  That helped us 
tr em endous ly bec aus e they did it right away.  I think they m ust have had a depos it on the farm  before 
the war
 
br ok e out.  They put a depos it on the farm befor e the last two uncles  c ame to Kenya.  They 
were on the last s hip out of Germany.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  The war break  out in Kenya is  als o s ignific ant bec ause at the time Kenya was  a 

Br itis h c olony.  So onc e the

br oke out.  All the men wer e picked up and put into a c am p.  We bec ame enemy aliens .  They didn't 

know the differenc e between J ews  and non

J ews . We were all enemy aliens .

and in our c as e they let the five men out bec aus e we had

We c ould not leave the far m without written permis s ion.

And then m other m oved to Nairobi.

and blac k  hair .  The Br itis h were ver y r ac is t towar ds  the Indians that lived in Kenya.  And 
ther e wer e m any, m any, m any Indians .  So they didn't ask  him any ques tions .  They just looked at him .  
And whenever we enter

he went into any offic ial plac e, they kicked him out.  And when we wer e in 
s c hool, he would c ome and vis it us .  He would let us  know whic h hotel he would m eet us  at in town.  

We would go there and I would s ay, "
P

was  interes ting bec aus e som e of the Br itis h people wer e r eally, really nic e and helped us a lot.  Some 
of them were ver y r ac is t.  The news papers  wer e terr ibl

anti

Semitic.  And I had it in s c hool.  It filtered 
down to the childr en. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Sure.  J ill, I'd like to give our  audienc e s om e tim e to ask  ques tions.  If it's ok  with 
you, I will say jus t one more thing.  When you left Kenya, you were 14 years  
old.
 

> > J ill P auly:  15. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  15 year s  old.  It was  just befor e the upris ing s o ther e wer e tens ions . 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  The upris ing was  in 1952.  We left in 1947.  And the fam ily left the far m, didn't s ell it 
bec aus e they wanted to keep it.  They loved it.  But they los t it.  It c om pletely devaluated.  So they los t 
ever ything they had twic e.  And they had to start all over  again
 i
n the s tates .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  That's  the part I want to ask a bunc h of ques tions  about, however , I think we shou

turn it over .

So with that, does anyone have a question for  J ill?

Your name is  beautiful, Gis ella. Why did you c hange your name?

One m ore quick

that I grew up to be quite a tough 
kid.  Uh
-
huh.  I had a lot of experienc es .  The las t one was  when I was  about 12, just the right age.  
There was  a gir l that torm ented m e.  She had a thing with J ews .  And even as  a c hild, I c ouldn't figur e 

ou
t 
--
 
what does  s he know about J ews ?
  
T
her e aren't any J ews  her e.  I was  the only Jewis h kid in 
s c hool and what is  it about me that's so im portant?  You k now?  She jus t was  a nas ty gir l.  Really nas ty 

per s on.  And we wer e on a hockey team.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > J ill P auly
:  Sports wer e ver y, very impor tant.  We had sports  at the s c hool, thr ee, four days  a week .  
We wer e playing a gam e.  We m ust have been on oppos ite sides  of the team .  She hit me in m y shins  

with her hockey s tick  on pur pos e.  And that was  the las t time s he
 
ever  hit me.

Bets y Anthony:  That's  a stor y I never  hear d.

[Laughter]
 
>> 
Your pr operty, your fam ily owned it for 400 year s . Who owns  it now?
 
> > J ill Pauly:  My family didn't own it for 400 years .  They lived in the ar ea for  400 years .  It was  my 
father's gener ati
on that bec am e wealthy.  My gr andfather  was  a sm all
-
tim e bus iness m an.  It didn't 
m ake him  r ic h, just had it.  Later , oh, yes .  After the war  c am e, the r estitution m oney.  And the land was  
in the c ourts  for years .  My family won the c ourt c as e and they s ent
 
m oney.  It was  divided.  And then 
one of m y unc les went bac k  to vis it, good friends , old fr iends  that I'm still in touc h with.  They didn't get 

the value.  So that's  what happened.  Ever ything was  taken.  Hous es.  The day they got the letter  on 
the 1st of
 
J anuary
 
1938, ever ything that the fam ily ever  had becam e the property of the German 
governm ent.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I s ee a hand in the back .
 
>> 
Hi ther e.  First of all, thank  you for s har ing your stor y with us .  You both s ort of touc hed on going 
bac k  to
 --  
you'r e going to have to tell m e how to pr onounc e the nam e of the town you're fr om .  But I was  
interes ted in that part of your s tor y if you c ould tell us  a little bit about that. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  You're inter ested in her r etur ning in the last c ouple of
 
year s ?  Lec henic h?
 
>> 
Sor ry about that.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  That's  a gr eat question.  Why don't you tell us  about retur ning ther e. 
 
> > Jill Pauly:  I r etur ned firs t time in 1982.  We were having a pers onal c ris is  in the fam ily.  That 

s tr engthened m e.  I s a
id, "I
f I c an go through this , I go back  to Germ any."  And my hus band's  c ousin 
was  wor king for the Israeli embas s y.  I was  for five years , twic e I think.  He kept inviting us.  So we 

went.
 
 
And, of c our s e, we both went bac k  to where we c ame fr om. We drove
 
into the town.  I had 
r ead s omewhere
 
--
 
this  was 1982
 
--
 
that the Germ ans  r eally don't like
 
--
 
they feel invaded when people 
c om e back and want to see wher e they c am e from .  And I m us t have r ead that.  And I dec ided I'm 
going to
 
the
 
polic e departm ent.  
He
 
s aid 
I was  c raz y.  I s aid, I'm  going to the
 
--
 
the polic e was  r ight next 
to the hous e.  He said, 
ﬁW
hat are you going to do with the polic e depar tment?
ﬂ
  
I s aid
, ﬁ
I'm going to ask 
s om ebody to go with me.
ﬂ
  
I don't want to be invas ive.  I don't want to be rude.  But I'd like to s ee the 
hous e. 
 S
o there was  a young polic eman there.  He was  very nic e.  He s aid, "I don't have to go with 
you.."  I s aid, "Yes, please."  And he did.  And it's  a good thing.  I don't know
 
--
 
bec aus e ever s inc e then 
s he's  never let me back in the hous e. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Really?  So the firs t time when he went with you
 
--
 
> > J ill Pauly:  She got s car ed and let m e in the hous e. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  And you tr ied again? 
 
> > J ill Pauly:  The las t time, a c ouple of year s  ago, my friend went with me, the lady who inv ited me.  

She's  the gr anddaughter of the m an who was  in the field with m y unc le who was  photographed.  Ok?  
Sh
e was  with me.  And she s aid, "Com e on
. Sh
e'll let me in."  I said, "
S
he's not going to let me in."  She 
knock ed.  She wouldn't let us in. 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  Wow.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  And I s pok e that night.  I was  invited to s peak  to the c om munity.  The s c hools  wer e not 
s uc ces sful.  I spoke at the s chools .  The kids  had their internet.  They s aw my bio.  It was n't s uc c essfu
l.  
I c ouldn't r eac h them.  That was  ok.  They were polite.  But the town, the group, about 300 people 
c am e.  I had a wonderful m oder ator  like you.  It was  very s uc c es sful.  And they asked m e all s or ts of 
questions .
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  That's  great.
 
> > J ill
 
Pauly:  And probably want to know how I felt.  It took  m e a very long tim e to be able to articulate 
the feelings I have.  It's a c us tom in our hom e to honor the dead by vis iting c em eteries  onc e a year.  So 
m y mother always  as ked us  go back  to the c emeter ies .  Bec aus e s he s aid if we didn't, they would be 
enc r oac hed.  She was  right.  I went back .  In Cologne, I didn't have anyone that I knew in Cologne in 
the c emeteries  but I went back , s everal.

Then thes e people asked m e when I s pok e would I like to c ome
 
back  to live in Lec henic h.  
And I s aid, "Why?"  I s aid i
t's very nic e of you but I would be c ut off fr om m y world from m y people.  I 
have c hildren.  I have no roots  here.  I never built r oots her e.  I don't want to live here.
  
If I want to live 
any wher e, if it's not the United States , I'll go to my anc es tr al homeland whic h is  Isr ael.
 
 
Ok.  The s ec ond question was :  Do you get homes ic k  for Germ any? What do you think? 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I think  we c an figur e tha
t out.
 
> > J ill Pauly:  I'm vis iting there.  It's a beautiful c ountr y.  The people ar e nic e to us .  I like vis iting ther e.  
And in the future I hope the r elations with Germany s tay the way they ar e now, whic h is  gr eat.  But for 
J ews  to go back , you go to the c emetery, people are bur ied there.  Ther e is  no gr owth.  There is  no 
c ous ins .  There is  no ances tor s.  There's nothing left
f
or J ews .  So you have to s tar t fr om s cratc h.
 
> > Bets y Anthony:  I'm  afraid we have to stop here. 
 
 
J ill, thank you s o m uc h.  Every time I hear you s peak  I learn s omething new.  Thank  you for

> > J ill Pauly:  Well, I thought about it while I was  pulling weeds  in m y gar den this  mor ning.  You know, 

s om e ver y, ver y br illiant people es tablis hed this  mus eum for the reas on that the s ur vivors  who wer e 
involved wanted to give bac k  to the c ountry that they were able to start their  lives  new.  They wanted to 
leave s om ething for  future generations  to learn about what evil c an do.  I've been c om ing he
r e now for  
21 year s .  And what I s ee is  that this  plac e, this  mus eum, is  getting m or e moder n by the day; that the 
world is having m or e and m ore problems by the day and that youngsters can c om e here with the little 
s ec ond br ain that they car ry around and instead of looking at your favor ite things  all day, s tudy, lear n.  
Let this  plac e be a beac on for your future.  The mor e you know, the eas ier it gets  in life. 
 
 
That's all I have to s ay today.
