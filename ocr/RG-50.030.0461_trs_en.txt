LOUISE SEGAAR 
 November 10, 2000 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
Question: This is an interview with Louise 
Segaar, conducted by Katie Davis, on November 10
th
, 
2000, at the Holocaust Museum, at the L™Enfant Pl
aza. This is tape  number one, side  A. If we 
can just begin -- if you can give your full name  at birth. 

Answer: Louise Julia Von Ca mmingha. 

Q: Can you spell your last name? 

A: C-a-m- m-i-n-g-h-a. 

Q: And whe n were you born? 

A: Nove mb er 14, 1920.  

Q: Okay, and where? 

A: Patavia, in Jaffa, Indonesia. In those days was Dutch East Indies. 
Q: Can you tell us the name s of your mother and father? 
A: My father™s name  is bar -- Baron Ruurd V
on Ca mmingha , my mother™s name  was  Jacqueline 

Von Sweetin. Now, she is from a ge neral™s fa
mily, and they had plantations in Indonesia. 

Q: Can you please spell your father™s name , Ruurd? 

A: R-u-u-r-d, and then Ca rl, so my son is the same name . And his sister had a son, was also 

Ruurd Carl, and he got smashed 
by a  Nazi truck when he was 16, 
on the way from hi gh school to 
his house. 

Q: Can you tell us a little bit more about what 
your mother and father were doing in Indonesia? 
A: We  owne d plantations, we lived there. My mo
ther was born in Malung, and my fa ther was 
sent by the needelaunser handles
bunk, to have a office in Jaffa. So, they met there, and got

ma rried, and I was born -- my brother was bor
n in Polungbung, and we went back to Holland 
when I was four, because  he was assi gned to anot her job in the Netherlands, and 15 years later 

was my sister born. 

Q: Can you tell us the name s 
of your brother and sister? 
A: My brother™s name  is Feetus
 Valerius Von Cammingha, and my 
sister is Kristina Maria. I™m 
laughing, because we don™t call each
 other that wa y. Totally differe
nt names. But Kristina Maria 
Von Ca mmi ngha. We  call her Snane. A
nd my brother is Peterbas. Crazy. 
Q: These are nickname s? 

A: Yeah, because as a child, it was too difficult to 
figure out the real name s, so that was what we 
gave them, and that held on for years.  

Q: Right, right. Did you yourself ha ve a nickname  when you were young? 

A: Yeah, my name  is Lukie. And now I have
 a business on the websit
e, I™m -- I -- I™m now 
Bonzo, because that was the name  during the war as an underground person. You never said your 
own na me , but you had a fake name , just in case, to
 be on the safe side. So Bonzo is that little 
dog, look like a bulldog, you know?  Feisty, and very 
determined, and you don™t get rid of that 
dog very easy. 
Q: Can you tell us a bit about daily life when you
 were four, or five, or six, you™re beginning to 
become  awa r e of things, back 
-- back in the [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, we had -- we had servants. Of course
, all Indonesian, and they were watching us, and 
they -- they cleaned the house, they were cooki
ng, and doing the laundry, and the laundry was 
done in the river, and that was slammed on the --
 on the rocks. And then a little bit further was 
some one br ushing the teeth. That 
was life in Indonesia. We  alwa
ys had protection, we always 
had people with a gun, just in case, because it wa
s always kind of difficult time s. And well, for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
3 
 
 
the rest, it was -- it was very protective. You 
could not go out, for instance, to the pussar by 
yourself. The pussar is like a departme nt place,
 where you buy st-stuff fr om outside, because you 
could get on the back a knife. So why would you provoke that?  There™s off -- obviously we have 
a -- an -- an -- a white skin, wh
ile the population is brown skinne
d, so -- but mostly they had 
respect. After all, we -- we were a colony, and 
if we had to complain, it was not very, very 
difficult to put a person in -- in jail. And in t
hose days no lawyers to defend. If -- if you got a 
complain, no questions asked, there 
you go. That was the way it happened.  
Q: And wha t  was it like when you went back to --
 where your parent -- well, where your fa mily 
originally was fr om -- fr om the Netherlands? 

A: Yeah, yeah, to the Netherlands -- see, my fa
ther was born in Amsterdam, so his parents were 
in Holland, and my mother™s parents were still in 
Indonesia. And well, we just lived in -- in the 
street, I can reme mber that, was a -- a -- a hous
e over -- over the entr
ance of a garage, so I 
reme mber it was always cold, because the wind 
always goes through that -- that entrance. Why 
they picked that house, I never could understa
nd that. And the school was close by, we  could 
walk. In the Netherlands, you don™t have that system
 as here, that the school buses, you just go 
on the bike, or you pick a school cl
ose to your house, that™s how 
it was there. And it was always 
raining. Holland is always damp-y, a nd -- you get us
ed to that, too, th-the raincoat was way until 
the ankles. And you had beautiful skin, because
 always wet, you know, always pinky. And you 
just take things the way it happens, no comp
lain. You don™t know anything better. But I do 
realize that my mother was re
lieved because my mother was not accustomed to the Indonesian 
climate. See, over there, you have six -- six months 
that it is pouring rain, 
and six months is it so 
dry that we had red earth in the ears, and in the nose, and on -- because  of the dust. So that was 

what we called the dry season. And then the wet 
season was -- if it was always pouring rain, no, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
4 
 
 
if it was raining, if you would sta
nd in -- on the street, and the ra
in would fall, on this side you 
were wet, on this side you was dry. I never fo
rget that, and it was always six o™clock.  
Q: So you actually have a lot me mories of Indonesia? 
A: Oh, definitely. I had my own 
monkey. I had my own parrot, white
 with a little tuft. And that 
parrot was talking, and the monkey was always 
hugging me, loving me to pieces. I miss that, 
because here you™re not allowed to ha ve a monke
y. But it is companionship, and you feel kind of 
-- you know, you have some thing that belongs, and th
at you protect. Cause the natives, of course, 
they protected you, but they had no interest in you as a person. They only had interest in 

themselves, to stay safe. We played tennis, and we  -- we swam a lot. I reme mber you -- you went 

in your pajama s to the movies, that that™s
 the custom, you know?  Nobody™s looking around like 
she™s crazy, it is just the way th
at -- that you lived, that way.  

Q: And whe n you went back, did -- to the house,
 you s -- can -- you say you reme mbe r  the street. 
Can you describe the neighborhood a little b it more?  This is in the Netherlands. 
A: In the Netherlands?  Oh yeah, but see that wa
s not changed that much. I was the last time in 
™84, and everything was changed. And that™s why af
ter that, I f -- I told my sister, I have no 
inclinations to go back, because it 
is so changed, I don™t re-reme mber that is my country. It™s all 
highway, modern buildings, the roads are ap -- 
you know here the -- the 
Beltway?  In Holland is 
it much worse. Because you have not been prepared. Holland is as -- as small as New Jersey. 
Everything has to be one way, because the streets 
are so narrow. In those days -- the houses were 
built in 12 -- 1200, and then in 16-1700, was mo-mor
e built. So if you go to Amsterda m, or The 
Hague, the streets you can only walk in. A car woul
d not even move, because it is so shuclocked, 
you couldn™t ma ke a turn, it was blocked. Y-You don™
t even need a traffic sign, because it™s not 
necessary. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
5 
 
 
Q: So where do people leave their cars?  
A: We ll, you have parking space, if you can find one
, but it could be two blocks away -- as long 
as you have your car parked. And that is why we 
didn™t have a car, we had bikes. I was always 
on the bike, cause that™s the easy. 
And you -- you kept your bike in 
the house, because they were 
stealing like heck. Now we had 
the Germans, for instance, we  -- we were, for instance, on one 
end of the street, blocked by truc
ks, two or three, full of soldie
rs, and on the other side of the 
street the same  way, so you could not get out, 
period. And then they were doing rusias. A rusia 
means that this house to house search, for either 
a radio, a fur coat, a bi
ke, anything that they 
could use. And if you wo uld listen to the BBC 
for  news, then you would get down on your knees 
in front of your front door, ping, out.  

Q: What? 

A: Killed. Oh yeah.  

Q: Oh, you mean if -- if you were 
discovered listening to the news? 
A: That™s right. Now, my father -- my whol
e fa mily is like r-rebels, you know, we -- we do 
things that you™re not supposed to, but we do it,
 because we are not told
 by any big mouth shot, 
what we can and cannot do. So, my father was al
ways listening. So when we had that search, 

when the -- I -- I stretch my hand this way on the 
-- at the door, so they
 could not pass, and I 
always had my unifor m on, because you have to l
earn a weakness of a person -- I studied that. So 
I found out the Germans were always scared for illn
ess, for anything that is
 contagious. So I told 
them point blank -- I™m a big liar -- with straight
 poker face, sorry, but I have a diphtheria patient  

in the back. Of course not true. So what?  And th
en my father would yell fr om upstairs, ﬁ Who is 
there?ﬂ I said, ﬁDad, this is rotmoff.ﬂ That™s Dutc
h for rotten Jerry. Oh, my father dashed to the -
- the radio, turn it off, house quiet. So, the Germ
ans didn™t know what I was saying, but they had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
6 
 
 
enough, and get out, they didn™t want to get sick. 
So that was the way it happened in my house. 
Now, I don™t know, next door neighbors, because you was very cautious that you didn™t say too 
much. 

Q: Can you talk a little bit more about -- you sa
id no one in my fa m -- your fa mily is full of 

rebels. Ta lk a little bit more a
bout other things your father di
d, even before the Germans came, 
that sort of taught you that, how to 
-- to really be your own  person. 
A: Oh yeah, well we are very military. My fa ther graduated in Breedah, sa y as similar as here, 

West Point. My younger son graduated from We st 
Point. My older son is from VMI. So we 

always teased each other. The We st Point son sai
d, ﬁYou -- you got to tell sir to me .ﬂ Now he™s 
nine years younger than my older son, so my ol
der son, ﬁYou can go to you know where.ﬂ They 

always were joking, but we were 
brought up very strict, and my fa
ther was a banker, so I learned 
finances quick. In -- in 1929, with
 the depression, I got a -- an 
income  of a dime  on Sundays, and 
I had to write everyt hing down on a little book, the expenses, and the income , and if it was not 
balanced, I would not get my salary.  
Q: Intere sting. 

A: And then on my mother™s side, my mother™s 
father was a general, w
ho fought in the archie 

war, and he earned a golden urn, and that was pu
t in a home for retired soldiers, that is called 

Brombake. And if you visit them, they know, ﬁOh 
yeah, General Von Sweetin.ﬂ My mother had 
a brother who was a captain in the Dutch army. 
My father was in Hoosar, and that me ans you 
have your own horse, and you are in the cavalry. 
And another brother, who was shot by the 
Germans in the airport, was a captain in the ar
my, and he was not in the underground, he was in 
the regular army, but he tried to stop a German
 airplane, and when he was shooting, while the 
airplane was landing, they 
shot him instead, so -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
7 
 
 
Q: Who -- what was his name?  
A: Edward. 

Q: Edward. 

A: So my younger son is also Edward. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So would have been Edward -- last name? 

A: Sa me . 

Q: Von -- 

A: My uncle was Edward Von Swee tin, because he
 was a -- a -- a brother of my mother. Now, 
we have a museum in Br ombake, and we have -- 
that is the Von Sweetin museum, and we have a 
museum in Leeuwarden, that is the Von Ca mmi
ngha museum. And we had 
a castle on the island 
of Leeuwarden, but that was burned down, and then
 we had some  other castle. You just flow 
away with castles -- close to L
eeuwarden, and I ha ve a booklet there, that is now the place of a 
well known Dutch soccer club -- soccer team. So I 
got that -- my son we
nt to Holland, and he 
was very impressed with that, and he was visiti
ng them, and telling them that my mother was 
here, but I ne ver cont acted them, because I was so
 busy. I still have to do that, though. So they 
have a team there, on th
e ground of the -- the castle. 
Q: Oh. 

A: Yeah. Yeah, it is fantastic, and amazi
ng how -- how that, you know, develops, yeah. 
Q: I™m wondering if you could 
think back to when your -- you
™re still pretty young, and eating 
dinner perhaps, together, and the -- the discussions 
at the fami ly meal, or just family discussions 
about politics, in general -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
8 
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah? 
Q: What kinds of things were 
your mother and father saying? 
A: We ll, to be honest, we  were not always togeth
er. My brother was in -- in what do you call it, 
college. And I was, of course, in another city, 
in Haarlem, as a nurse. A student nurse. And my 
sister was born in ™35, so she was like five to
 10 years old during that period, so she was at 
school. But we were eating in the -- in the living 
room, I re member that, no central heat in those 
days, because it was just not existing. The Germ
a ns stole anything, everything what was stolable. 
So we had an -- a stove that was heated by coal, and it smelled horrible, so we had always the 

window open. And we cooked like tulip bulbs, and -- I 
have a list of -- of ite
ms  that we -- we had 
in those da ys, because th-th-the st ores were 
just  empty. There was no food. And that was on 

purpose, to let us die out. Simple, you know. You just
 don™t feed the person, so
 they have to -- to 
die. So you saw people walking around as a skel eton, because if you have no fa mily that takes 

care, and you are by yourself, the only way to 
get stuff is go to the farm, a nd exchange like 
linens, or clothing, and then you got your food, 
so that™s what we did on the bicycle. 
Q: I see. A-And, I™m going back now to befo
re the Germans came. What w -- did Jews live 

mi xed into your neighborhood -- 

A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: -- or -- tell --  tell us
 a little bit about that . 

A: Okay, we -- we lived in -- like in the von -- vo
n alka ma dalan, and there were family that was 
all Girl Scouts. Six girls, all very intelligent, 
and -- and all playing a musical instrume nt. I was 
drawn to that family so -- so much, because they
 had such a ni ce attitude, and they were so full 

of faith, like nothing could happen. They were -- they
 were not afraid at all. But I warned them, 
since I was already in that time, informed. Istarted in 1933 to smell something. I me an, you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
9 
 
 
you didn™t have a TV in those da
ys, but if you went to the movi
es, there was news before the 
movie started, and I saw the -- the 
inclination of lots of legs, 
and lots of parading, big mouth 
speeches, you know, so I was already in -- in my
 heart feeling that™s no good. Now, Holland was 
always neutral, in World War One wa s -- we were ne
utral still. We  didn™t e
xpect them t o get in -- 
against our rule that we were neut
ral, and we stayed that way. We  
ma de that very clear. The heck 
with us, that™s their attitude. So our queen wa
s warned on time , Queen Julianna and her kids 

went to Canada. I have pictures of those, 
too. My next door neighbor, Rost Von Tunningham, 
you will not believe  that. One brother was with the queen, was always picked up with a horse 

and buggy, had his uniform with that big type of ha
t, like an admi ral wears in those days. And 
the other brother was an NSB me
mber. National Sas -- Socialist B
und. So that were two brothers 
in one family clashi ng. So was very important th
at you could trust each other. So I ha d his name  
on the list of people that would have been
 cckk. See, everything in Holland was -- 
Q: That would have been? 
A: Killed. Shot. We  went to the dunes, we were in
 Schevening, so that is all dunes, and sand and 
stuff like that, so in the dunes we had -- the 
Germans ma de those shelters. And then you would 
hear, dat da da dat da da da, some one  was k
illed. You didn™t know w
ho, because you never get 
information, but if you wanted information, you kne
w people to get it from. I kept mo uth shut. 
Q: You said that you started seeing some  of the 
news before the movies. What -- can you tell us 
more about why it worried you?  You said you just had a bad feeling. 
A: Too -- yeah, too muc h propaganda, too mu
ch big mouth, and provo
cation. Why would she do 
that to a -- a -- a person that is
 your friend?  See, if 
you start to do that, then
 I start to think you 
are not my friend. I™m very sensitive person. If -- 
if I have a person in front of me  that talks 
negative, I have an intuition, watch out. That is
 just me . I was born with
 that. And I could have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
10 
 
 
been even psychiatr -- what do you call it, some one 
that looks in the future, because I get always 
in the ma il, people in that fiel
d. Now, I™m not stupid, if they sa
y I do a free reading, and then at 
the end you get a form to fill out, 20 dollars, I se
nd that form nicely back without the 20 dollars, 
because in the beginning they said it was free. 
I™m not that -- you -- so that was in those days, 
too. I -- I have a very sensitive feeling about things. 
Q: Wa s it some thing that you expressed to your parents in any way? 

A: No. They didn™t even know I was in the underg
round. We  had even a soldier in the house, in 

my brother™s room, yea h. But the soldier was nice. He
 was my age, so he almost fell in love with 
me . He asked me  for a date. I said, ﬁListen budd
y, you have that rotten uniform on. Do you think 
I™m stupid? ﬂ But he ale -- always came back from
 his farm i n Ha mburg with eggs, with butter, 
with that -- my father said, 
ﬁDon™t accept it.ﬂ My mother sa
id, ﬁUh-uh. I cook with it.ﬂ   
Q: So I™m trying to get a sense of how you became 
politically aware. Some of it is instinct, but 
you me ntioned that your fa mily is -- is a fa mily 
full of very strong charac
ters also. So, let™s go 
back still to the time  before the Germans have 
come . When you start seei
ng some  news about the 
Germans, what are people sayi ng?  Whe- When are you starting to 
get very worried, or -- or how 
is that if you could just sort
 of explain that progression. 

A: Okay. In the first place, I was a Girl Scout, in 
--  in --  in that time was girl --  Girl™s Guide. 
Course that™s in Holland different. In 1937, Ivisited the boy™s jamboree. That was in -- in 

Hilversum. I noticed there were no Germans, so 
I talked with the American. She w -- in those 

days, in Holland, you get English, you get Germa
n, you get French, if you™re 11 years old. So I 
had contact with the American 
soldiers -- Boy  Scouts, because
 I was impressed about their 
camps, their -- their tents, very efficient. Thei
r equipment, like they had the water thing hanging, 
and that™s what they got fresh water from. Their 
whole attitude appealed 
to me . And t hen, I was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
11 
 
 
me mber of a  hockey club. That is field hockey. Th
at is British inclined. Then, of course, I was 
told you cannot do anythi ng in the uniform, because
 that is -- that™s poor British. So I alr -- 
already felt there is some thing fishy going on. Wh y 
is this forbidden, why is that forbidden?  And 
it was not even war yet. And if you talk to a Du
tch, forbidden means resent. You already start to. 
In Holland you don™t need a lawyer. If you have a 
handshake because you agree, that is the 
promise that you ma ke, and you stick to that. Y
ou can trust a Dutch word. You cannot trust a 
German word. It™s full of lies, it™s full of pr
omises because they want to mellow you. And we are 
not that way. We  are very cautious. So when I saw 
that shelters were built, when I wa s told you 
cannot have lights -- bulbs, like this
 bright light, forget 
it. It had to be covered with blue, so the 
light would go straight down, it would ne
ver go outside your window. Now, everybody was 
taped -- had taped their windows, because ev 
-- we were bombed. See, 
if -- then the windows 
would not break, or it would just hang on the tape
. So there were all kind of insinuations. Try to 
get tires for your bike, because rubber would not
 be available. It happened. Our bikes were 
having wooden wheels instead. The word hoarding, here
 in America, that™s a bad word. I hoard. I 
hoard strange things, because you never know if you n
eed it to use next time
. And that™s one part 
that they say, you know, in here. But that was ha
ppening in those days. Y
ou take things in the 
house, in case.

Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of an interview 
with Louise Segaar. In
terview™s being done on 
Nove mber 10
th
, in the year 2000, at the United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum. This is tape 
one, side B. So you -- y-you were accumulating 
really, evidence that some thing was going 
wrong. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
12 
 
 
A: We  not only got very good information with th
e BBC, because of course, they had spies all 
over, already, in that time. But a -- as certain at
titudes, like the next door
 neighbor with the NSB 
organization, who were against our governme nt, 
and if you are very much for the queen, and you 
are in the military, and you take the oath of 
defending your country, you just don™t take that, you 
fight back. Not necessarily with a weapon, but y
ou can fight back with sabotage. We  sabotaged 
plenty. So when it was the time for the Germans 
to go in Holland, they pretended that it was 
necessary, because they had to in-invade Great Brita
in. And we just br oke the dikes, so the water 
was -- was all over the bolus. You know, the Netherla
nds is much lower on the sea level than this 
country is, so we were used that the water woul
d flow down, and you just cope with the fact that 
you cannot grow anything any more , and everything 
run -- drowns. But the point was that the 
German hea vy equipme nt could not go through, see?
 So the Germans we re forced to go over in 
the air. It was wall to wall airpla
nes. And they came  w
ith -- what do you call that
 in -- in English. 
In -- in German is -- it™s falsesharem. Parachutes
, parachutes. So, it was a 
nice target  to -- to -- 
from the ground up, to kill those parachutes when they were comi ng down. I always felt sorry, 
because those people were their own age, 
like me . And why would you kill an -- a young boy 
that is forced to do something he
 doesn™t want to do?  Because, I 
talked with them. We -- we had 
the -- you know, that we were on the beach, and I would sneak up on -- on the one guy, he had 

lots of hair, all black hair. And we -- we ma
de a bet -- the girls around me, you don™t dare. So I 
sneak behind, and I did like this over his hair. And then he would go, ﬁOh, what are you doing 

here? ﬂ  In German, huh. I  said, ﬁDon™t worry, I™m ju
st -- you know, I™m ha ving a bet, and I won.ﬂ 
Now you can see what a crazy kid I was. So we ha
d talks, and then they 
-- he said, well, don™t 
fear us, because we are just in
 the army, and if we
 don™t do it, what we are supposed to do, we 
get killed in our -- our own countr
y. So I found out a lot from them
. Besides, I had a girlfriend -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
13 
 
 
that was after the war, who had a castle in 
Germa ny, and she said, ﬁWhen I was on my own 
grounds, going a certain direction, th
ere was an -- a guard telling me  to go back in my castle, 
because there was some t hing fa -- fishy in that
 area.ﬂ Where the smell 
came from? Concentration 
camp. So they had concentration camps all over, and the German population was not supposed to 
know about it. So, in -- in a way, I -- I always sa
id, I feel like I hate the Ge rmans. I cannot say 
that, because in every country -- now here, w
ith the politics, you have Republicans, and you have 
De mocrats, also divided. It™s 
incredible. So it is in every c
ountry that way. But you had to be 
careful, because how did you know? 

Q: Did -- did your father ever consider, as war 
dr ew near, getting you out of the country, perhaps 
going to the United States, or -- 

A: No. At that time  you had no chance. You was 
-- see, you need a permit. Everything is done by 
the governme nt. The government could not be truste
d either, was very divided. The queen had to 
leave. Many people of the governme nt had to esca
pe. So, the governme nt that ti -- that time, was 
already corrupt. You need a passport, you needa visa, you need permission, you need a sponsor. 

That all hinders you. So we sp -- we were sponsor
ed after the war, because we could pr ove that 
he could come . But if I would dow -- put down on 
my application, Nazi, or me mber of that, do 
you think United States was crazy enough to -- to le
t me  in?  See?  So -- and we had no intentions. 
We -- we were ready to fight for what we had to
 fight. You mean -- I -- I would have been a -- a 
coward if I would have tried to get out. My j
ob was to protect the people, like the Jews, like the 
gays, like -- what do you call those 
people?  Gypsies. The Germans had the particular type of 
person that they did not like, and they were pers ecuted. So our job was to -- to get coupons so 

that we could buy food. To get the -- the word Jew off their chest. The -- the word Jew was 

printed on a star, and that wa
s -- was sewed on -- on any -- any clothing. So if you went on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
14 
 
 
street, you have to wear that. What
 we did was take it off, give them another piece of cloth, hide 
them. They were not allowed in the street any 
more. Now, yesterday wa
s Kristallnacht. I never 
forget that either, because any store that belong
ed to a Jew was smashed in with rocks, with 
stone that they picked up from
 the street, because in Holland, ev
ery street is done with stones, 
you don™t see concrete that much. And because my fa
mily is pr etty religious, my -- my  father™s 
sister belonged to the Haranhurtu
s. Haranhurtus is a sect that is
 very religious, and -- and has a 
strong faith, and is very optimistic, and helps you
. A person with a me ntal problem, for  instance, 
would feel a lot better if you was 
in connection with the Haranhurta
, because that™s -- that was 
the way they were living. And so
 we knew a -- a watchmaker, I never forget that either. Now, my  
aunt lived in Utrecht, a separate city, and th
at poor fa mily was st
oned, and -- and the window 
was all busted, and people were helping themselves
. All those watches we re -- were in -- in the 
store, or  clocks, whatever, they 
just dragged it out. The ma n was 
just robbed death. Just because 
he was a Jew. So I was very res-resentful, and 
I tell you, when the war wa
s finished, we let them 
pay. We  let the Germans pay before they went ba
ck to -- to the German, to their own country. 
We let them walk, we didn™t provide any transp
ortation. Now, that is 
about a three hour walk. 
And we had the girls who had been dating, put on 
the table, on the street. We threw them with 
rotten eggs, rotten toma toes, and we shaved thei
r hair off completely, to show everybody that girl 
is a trait -- betrayed -- for a threat. No, we we
re very mean. But see, you are ma de that way. You 
cannot swallow all that crap.  
Q: Tell us a little bit more about Kristallnacht.
 At -- you me ntioned what 
happened in Utrecht, d-
do -- 

A: All over. 

Q: B-But -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
15 
 
 
A: In Hague. 
Q: [indecipherable] you describe
 what happened -- yeah -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- around where you lived? 

A: Yeah. Th-They threw rocks in -- in people™
s wi ndows of stores, in private windows. I don™t 
know what else to say, I mean that -- that was 
on the ninth of -- of Nove mb er, so if you say you 
try to forget, I cannot forget it, 
it™s like it happened yesterday.  

Q: Did you yourself stay in that ni
ght, or did you go out and watch? 
A: I wanted to see it. I had no fear. I still have 
no fear. In those days 
my brother was like Ann 
Frank in my  father™s office. My father belonged to the RNVB, that is here, triple A, similar. So 

he helped motorists in trouble, and stuff like th
at, and my father was a secretary. Now, I™m 80 
now, but I don™t look 80. My father at that time
, if you were 16 until 50 I think it was, you was 
not allowed on the street, you would be picked 
up and transported to We sterbork. We sterbork 
was a city close to the German border. You 
would get stripped from your clothing, and they 
would give you another ID, and you was then trans
ported to a factory in Germany. To heck with 
that. So, we -- we got food every day to my brothe
r. My father went once to his office, and it was 
very foggy that day, and a German shouted in his 
ear, ﬁToomshta shoengain.ﬂ So my fa ther woke 
up like, ﬁAre you crazy, I™m not going to do that.ﬂ So
 he ran -- we all good runners by the way -- 
around the shelter in -- in that fog, and he was 
shot at. He heard, you know, the soldier shooting 

at him. My father made it at home, and he sai
d, ﬁGet me  unde r the -- under the floor.ﬂ So we did 
that. Of course, no-nobody came at the door, because they didn™t know, in that fog, where he was 

anyway. But that was the last. We  learned our lesson. So I found that out later -- course I was in -

- in the hospital that -- that time, and in t
hose days you didn™t tell each ot her those things, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
16 
 
 
because you would not worry, or make a person 
worry, because I would not have st ayed in the 
hospital, I would have stayed home to protect. So
 I found that out after the war was finished. So 
we -- we had lots of thin
gs to tell to each other. 
Q: Tell us about when your brother -- y-you basi
cally described your brot
her being in hiding, but 
when did your parents put him in hiding? 
A: That is what I don™t know. 

Q: Oh. 

A: They -- see they don™t -- or ma ybe they said
 it, but is one ear in, 
one ear out. But I do know 
that when I was on vacation, or I 
had reason to leave the hospital,
 that I and my mother went 
with a pot with food. Now, you cannot keep th
at warm, huh, but anyway he got his food, and 
then we exchanged news with him. I think he had a radio. I think my father provided that. And of 

course, you had to do it in a way that the othe
r people on -- in that office were not aware, 
because you never knew of -- if there was a traitor 
in that office. But since my father had an high 
position, they had respect for him.  
Q: So where exactly was your brother hiding? 

A: In -- in that office -- 

Q: In the li -- in the office? 

A: -- in -- in the center of The Hague, Barkstrout . 

Q: Just in the office, or was he under -- 

A: In no -- 

Q: -- was he behind a closet, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
17 
 
 
A: Yeah. The office -- just like in Ann Frank, Bu
chen had a -- an -- a fake door, with the book 
thing, and then you would swivel 
that around, and then he was hidi
ng. But see, that was norma l. 
In those days, your -- you had to think a
bout something, you know, to -- to protect. 
Q: How old was he at that point? 
A: We ll, he is two years younger than I am. So if in 1940, I was 20, he was 18.  

Q: So at one point you went away, you were 
doing your work, or your 
education, and you came  
back, and your brother was in hiding. 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: And you didn™t ask a lot of questions. You even
tually saw him, but -- but that™s just how it 
was. 

A: Yeah. Because he had, of course, only the news 
what he -- we gave h
im. But since my father 
was listening to the BBC, and I was involved with
 scouting, and other things, I mean,  you just -- 
you just had to learn what was going around you,
 otherwise you could not function. I mean, I 
was a student nurse, in a way, but
 in that hospital were plenty
 people also in the underground. 
Now, for instance, one day I had the TBC patients. They need fresh air, so they were in the yard. 

So that ward was -- was empty, and I got this 
guy running to me , ﬁ Hide me , hide me .ﬂ A Dutch 

person. I says, ﬁGo on, go on in the bed, don™t move.ﬂ Then the German come s right behind him. 

ﬁDid you see anyone? ﬂ  Again, I sto
od like this. I said, ﬁDo you wa
nt to get TBC?  I didn™t see 
anyone.ﬂ Go eyeball to eyeball. In German. So he
 understood what he had to deal with. So he -- 
he looked with respect all of a sudden. First he
 looked like ch, another 
woma n, like most me n do 
anyway. But I had no intention to
 let him in. My intention was 
put my foot out, and then he 
would stumble over it, and I would jumped on his 
back, and he would not be alive out that door. 
That was my intention. So we were
 pretare -- prepared. So then he
 -- he ran to the other end of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
18 
 
 
the hall, because he couldn™t get any -- and this 
guy said, ﬁIs it okay? ﬂ I 
said, ﬁKeep mouth shut, 
I will tell you.ﬂ So I had to fi nd out first if ev
er ythi ng was okay, and then we had the ce llar, and 
we put him in that cellar. But the point was, in 
that time , we did not kno
w the director of that 
hospital, if he could be trusted. 
So everything was very risky, a
nd you had to be very careful. But 
I thought, we ll, if he goes in that -- in that baseme
nt with other people, then th-the -- the principal 
should be okay. Because he could find that out,
 if he was the -- the good type of principa l. 
Q: Why do you think your parents put your 
brother in hiding, and -- a-and not you? 
A: I was not in danger. I was a 
girl. I was a tomboy girl, and 
people say, ﬁOh boy, you have to be 
careful with her.ﬂ Because I could climb on -- on th
e -- on the rainpi pe to 
reach the roof of your 
house, and I beat the -- the boys 
of my age to pulp. They had to respect. I was a real nasty, 
because you get that way. If a boy is telling 
you you cannot do this, you cannot do that, I proved 
to them I could do it. That was the funny thing.And still, my next door neighbors are what you 

call skinheads. Th-the -- the boys in the 20™s. 
Q: Now?  
A: Oh yeah, they live right be
hind -- beside me . So they were 
using my ya rd like so what, you 
know, it™s j-just an old woma n. So t hey play ba
seball, and -- and whatever, and I picked up the 
balls and didn™t return it to them. And then th
ey would yell bloody murder, like saying words I 
better not repeat -- repeat in there. And one da
y I had enough of it, and I know karate, I did all -- 

all kinds of things in my life, all kinds of c
ourses. So, I wrapped my legs around the guys hip, 
very tight, couldn™t shake me  off, 
and mur -- you see my nails?  That 
is really like a cat. So fi ve 
nails on this side of his back, 
five nails on this side of his back. He had no shirt on. The blood 
was comi ng out. ﬁOw.ﬂ You should have heard him.
 He could not sleep for five days on his 
back. And that was the time  they didn™t play ball
 either. Wa s finished. Th
ey still are not looking 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
19 
 
 
at me . They are not looking at me , they are 
scared to death. Now they are now 25, in the 
meanti me , and whatever age, but no, y-you got to s
how respect. In -- in -- 
in Holland, also, I was 
followed by a guy in the dunes once, and I knew ther
e was some thing in his eyes that I did not 
like. So, I we nt around that shelter, and I ran, ran, 
ran, and I outran him. I have third -- third class 
me dal in racing with eight other high schools fr
om The Hague. And I have that someplace, too. 
So I -- I was good in -- in -- in track and field. I 
was team leader in my hockey team, and they 
were also all in the underground. But see, you don™t
 talk about that. In 
those days, you played 
hockey. And if a guy would ask you for a date, I woul
d not accept, just to be on the safe side. I 
did date, though. I mean, I was not that -- you 
know. But it was amazing 
that the guys I liked 
were all killed. They -- they went over to Belg
ium, and France, over the mountains, the Pyrenee 
to France -- to -- to Spain, and th
ey never reached England. And I 
found that out, too. But, you 
know, that -- that is the way things happen. I m
ean, I was careful, I could have been killed sev-
several time s. Th-There was a V -- V2 for instance
, that is a kind of a s m
all type of mi ssile, two 
streets from my house. Now, you can imagine that
 you have that here. Some failed, went back 
where they came from. One shell landed in the 
roof of my hous e, right 
through my bedroom, and 
I was hiding under the bed, because I was told th
e mattress will put -- be your protection. So I 
crawl out, and there it 
is, big shell, right through the roof. So 
we could not repair that at the time, 
because there was nobody to do it. We  had to mo ve. The rain was just pouring through. Oh, and 
then the day that -- that we had the invasion, I 
wa s on vacation, and five o™clock in the morning -
- I never forget that either -- a 
huge plane goes really diving in th
e street, between the trees, not 
even the tops of the trees, but half of the trees
, over the st reet, and -- 
and -- and -- and bombing 
the -- the barracks that  were on th
e end of that street. Now, they had horses. We  all came out in 
pajama s and stuff. I saw horses heads, legs, tail. 
Soldiers without a head we re still walking, in a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
20 
 
 
daze, of course, and then they dropped. I-It was so 
terrible to look at it, 
I can never forget that. 
So that was five o™clock in the mo
rning, and that was a holiday, like we 
have here. In -- in -- in -- 
in Europe, you called it Poppy day. We all walk
 with -- what is that, there is a red -- 
Q: Carnation? 
A: No, it™s a red, big flower. Poppies. Y
ou had poppy fields in Great Britain, also. 

Q: Poppy?  It™s a poppy? 

A: A poppy, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But there is another word for it, too. To reme mber the veterans. 

Q: Mm-hm. So, after the bombing that day, wh-w
hat are some  other me mo ries that you have 
from the invasion? 

A: That was the -- the actually visual experience,
 because in that time , I had my vacation for 
maybe four days. And you are not that stupid to
 go on the street and go back again, because the 
Germans took -- took care of that imme diatel
y. There was no chance. But you listened. You 
listened to neighbors, you listened to -- to the pe
ople that you are -- excuse me  -- that you are 

playing hockey with. We had to stop that for 
awhile, because we were too sad. I mean, you are 
just not in the mood. I-It -- it is 
too -- it™s too -- too -- too emo
tional. Yeah. And of course, we 
had that -- what do you call that
 here?  It™s funny, some ti me s I 
-- I forget the word. I know 
exactly it is -- it is like this. A f
uninis. What is that in English?
 Isn™t that stupid?  A cell, where 
you -- you -- you keep prisoners in. 

Q: A cell. 

A: A cell, yeah, yeah. So that was close by also. 
And you [indecipherable] is at that, because that 
was still in good hands, so called. But -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
21 
 
 
Q: We ll, when -- after the bombing, 
di -- we -- did Germans a ppear
 on the street?  Sort of taking 
charge on the street? 
A: Not -- not -- no, not yet, but it was the NSB, th
at was the -- the party that was what you call 
collaborating with the Ge rmans. So they send 
signals, or they called, or whatever. This 
happened, that happened, and the Germans were
 very pleased, you know, that everything went 
the way that they hoped it would go. But the NSB 
was not, of course, believing that there was 
another party to watch them, and so they lost -- 
they lost casually, their 
people, too. And that was 
because we were very active. We
 didn™t get no for an answer.  

Q: When you say you were on vacation, vacation from?  

A: That was a religious holiday, like -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- Easter. In that time was Pingstrund. You don™t 
have that here. I never found out what it is 
here.  
Q: Okay, and -- 
A: And then, on the bike, went back to the hospital. There was no bus. There was no train. 

Everything was on halt. So you used the bike. And 
that™s why I could not have the Germans to 
take my bike, that was it. And I told him that
. That™s -- that™s my -- 
and of course, you think, 
well, can™t she just go for two 
hours without hindrance?  Of cour
se I was hindered, but in those 
days, a nurse was respected. You needed a nurse. 
I had an old aunt, and she was in -- in ho-house 
for old people. We  went to visit her, to bri
ng food. That is just the way you do it. You don™t let 
your friends die. You work the hell 
out of you. I worked day and night.  
Q: What was your mo m 
doing at this point? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
22 
 
 
A: My mo m was not strong. Physically, when sh
e came from Indonesia, she was what you call -- 
she di -- didn™t have a particular
 illness, but I think th
at she was close to diabetes. She died at 83, 
and my father died when he was 94, but I have my
 father™s system. And so I don™t fear -- I mean, 
I don™t fear if I die, period, because that is
 a normal way, to accept the way things go, but I 
always wanted to be sure I don™t di e in an accide nt , or that I don™t die because some one else 
wants my life. I j-just fight, you know?  I™m -- I™m just
 that way. So ma ybe that
 is -- that is a kind 

of a vitami n. 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is an interview with Louise Seg
aar, conducted by Katie Davis, on Nove mber, 10
th
, the 
year 2000, at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. This is tape number two, side A. When the 
invasion happened, you described the -- the bom
bing, and the dead animals, and the dead 
soldiers. How -- what happened next?  When -- wh
en was the next time  you felt a presence of 

German sol diers? 

A: Gosh, you -- you meet them -- 

Q: O-Or -- of the, as you said -- 

A: Yeah, you meet them.  

Q: Mm-hm, okay. 

A: And as I said, I have no fear. They had the 
big mouth, but if you show that you have respect 
for them, then they are decent. I 
rather would meet German, than I 
would meet a Jap. A Jap is ne 
-- ne -- nasty. And a Jap is what you call you could 
not trust. They were mo
re sadistic. A Ger man 
is not sadi stic. They do certain things because th
ey feel that™s necessary to do. But they would 
not -- of course, in -- in -- in --
 in a cell, they would torture. Th
ere™s several ways to do that, but 
they got that back. So they found that out. If
 you do that to me, you get the same  thing back. 
Q: How did you understand at that point what th
e Germans were trying to do in your country? 
A: They were trying to get the country, and get 
at -- to Germany, an annex, okay. Because of the 
fact that we were so obnoxious, 
and stubborn and far, far back, it was mo re difficult for them to 
apprehend -- they didn™t expect 
our resistance. So instead, they 
stole. That was their big thing. 
So, we did anything to get their -- not to steal. So
 we hide it. In the stores, no food. We  had food, 
but they didn™t see it. We  had restaurants. On the window, in German, ﬁDeutsch nicht 

schwahan.ﬂ That means, German not  spoken. So th
ey could go the restaurant, they would not get 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
24 
 
 
coffee, they would ge -- not get a lunch. They 
would drop dead with us looking at them with 
pleasure. I saw once, one of those Germans on the floor, kicked down by a bunch of me n. Now, 
he was literally pumme led against his head, on top of
 his chest. He could not
 survive. But that is 
the Dutch way. If you do that to me , you get 10 times worse. So that spreads around. The 

Germans di d not do too much, what you call ki lli
ng, because they got it back 10 times worse.  
Q: You™re describing individual, 
sort of, acts of resistance -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- that people. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. Oh. 

A: Cause you see it. You have to see it if you --
 if you want to eat, you have to go out of your 
house and shop. Oh, I tell you. I saw in
 -- in -- I was once that -- th
at -- that was another place 
that I was in the staff of a -- 
a house for older people, that was 
close to Arnhem, and of course, 
you -- you could not use the bike, you had to go with
 -- with the train. But I was always tempted, 
but of course, you had to be careful. They were
 kicking, on the station, 
little kids, big, big 
German guy, six foot, with boots, rifle. They would 
use their -- the butt of th
e rifle to kick it™s -- 
in -- in those cattle wagons, for the Jews. And 
oh, I tell you, my hands were itching to get on the 
back of that German, and scratch his eyes out. 
But, there were too ma ny. So you got to be not 
stupid. Go back in the -- in the 
-- in the -- in the train, and go th
e way you have to go. But that is 
what I, after the war, told th
e Germans, ﬁYou are bastards. I have no respect for you for what you 
did. And don™t tell me  it didn™t happen, either.ﬂ I 
was here a tour guide. I 
did a course, I was in 
the bus with the Germans in the front of the bus
, and the Dutch in the back of the bus. So in 
Dutch, I told the Dutch, I said, ﬁHi, I speak 
Dutch.ﬂ The German said to me, ﬁYou speak 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
25 
 
 
German? ﬂ  I ignored him.  I looked over them. And 
that™s what I said in Dutch, to the people on 
the back, and they were clapping. Good luck, Loui
se, we listen to you. Don™t pay attention. Now 
that was in the American bus. I shorted them. That is my revenge, in a nice way. But I couldn™t 
help myself, I had to do it that way. 

Q: Be-Because, before any of this happened, 
how did you feel about Germans?  Wa y be fore 
Kristallnacht , or -- 

A: As friends. As friends. I feel you have to be fr
iends in -- in every wa
y. As a Girl Scout, it is 
international, so you me e t  Swedish, you meet -- in
 those days, were no Russian, either, but I me t 
from all countries, and I corresponded with ever
y country. I had to correspond it in Korea, in -- 
in Thailand, cause I™m interested in how their cult
ure is. I -- I -- I talked
 with Muslim, in the 
airport where I was working, I met a Muslim on his li
ttle carpet, in front of
 my door, I had to step 
over him. And I told him, how come that you ha
ve to pray five time s a day, and how can you 
work?  It doesn™t ma ke sense to me , but that™s
 their religion. So I™m curious, and I™m joking. I 
always see some thing funny behind some thing that is not supposed
 to be funny. But that is the 
way it happened. I me t Lord and Lady Bayton Powell.
 They were the founde
rs of the girl boy -- 
th-the Boy Scouts, and they are 
British. So that was in Addelb
oaden, in Switzerland, when I was 
finished with high school, and my fat her treated 
me , he -- he paid for the trip. And I went with 
A-Ake Larous, that is Swiss and 
French Girl S -- Girl 
Scout, Girl Guides. Little kids 12 years 
old. Di di di di, di di
 di di, di di di di, in French, y
ou know. And then you was put in little pup 
tents, like the military, but you could not put your 
finger against th-the -- the clot h, because the 
rain -- and it was always rain
ing, would ma ke drips, you know, it w
ould drip. So, of course, they 
did that, to find out it if that was true. And then 
I was -- I always had a fear for heights, so I went 
always like a dog, over the mountain 
-- the Mont Blan, for instance. 
I went on my fours, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
26 
 
 
were always laughing at me . There goes doggie 
Lukie. But you learn. And the Alps were 
beautiful. It was nothing -- and it
 was always fog, because it is high. So you had always  clouds 
around, and I al-al-al-always wanted 
to grab in the cloud, to see if
 my -- my hand would be wet. 
So you can tell I had crazy ideas. But we -- we ha
d lots of fun. Oh boy, did we have fun, and the 
food was delicious. It was Swiss food. But there 
was no German. They were not allowed. So, in 
those days, ‚33 - ‚34 - ‚35 - ‚36 
- ™37, you could feel 
the whole atmosphere, wherever you went.  
Q: Mm-hm. A-And situate us in 1940, when the 
invasion happens. How old were  you, and what 
are you doing?  You have said a couple times that 
you are already working in a hospital, but what 
is your status?  Are you 
still being 
educated? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay, just -- if you could situate us. 

A: I was a student. 

Q: Okay. 
A: See, I™m born in 1920, so in 1940, I happen to 
be 20, and then gradually -- it never happens at 
once, it goes gradually, so you hardly notice 
it until you wake up and think, uh-uh, there is 
some thing bad. And you get curious in a way, because 
that™s what I s -- also told those Germans, 
I -- I always like to know what is
 the reason you think a certain way?  Now, I always wa nted to 
be a student in psychiatrist, or
 whatever, but I™m -- I™m always 
intrigued to find out what ma kes 
you do the things what you do?  And don™t you ha
ve any regret?  Do you have a conscience?  
What do you expect after this, from what you do?  I 
had free talks with them. So I never had been 
arrested, or told you go with me . They left me  lik
e I had some  strange aurea, or angel like thing 
around me , because I was too strong for 
them. And all -- I always had that. 
Q: You said you™d have free conversations
. How would those come  about, usually? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
27 
 
 
A: I cannot reme mber really. The ma in thing was th
at they were my age. They were just also 
students, in whatever field. Very
 pleasant, very decent, very polite. I spoke Berlinne r German, 
that is what they told me , I 
don™t know, but I me a n that™s, you
 know, like perfect. Like Oxford 
English. That™s what I learned, Oxford English, 
because the teacher came  from Oxford. So he 
talked like that, too. And the Fren
ch was like Parisian French. So 
you go to Paris, I have been in 
Paris, and they don™t understa
nd you. That™s the funny part. Pa r-Pardon moi?  Pardon moi?  They 
say in French. What do I say funny, 
is that Russian?  So then they
 turned around like I™m an idiot. 
But that was the way it goes, and then we talked mo
stly about things that  
happen in that time . So 
about what you eat. In those days, 
the word sex never came up. That is
 what I thought later, that 
is funny. In this country it™s nothing but sex. Ev
ery day you hear about that, or you see it on TV. 
Over there you had no time  to think about that
, because there was no way, if the boys are hidi ng, 
the me n are in offices, where do you get that stu
ff?  And obviously, the Dutch are not lesbian. No 
way. So, I mean, that is how you talked about, mostly.  
Q: So, do you reme mber any of the name s of these young me n? 
A: No, never. We  didn™t exchange name s. 

Q: And whe r e mi ght -- what™s the one example of where you mi ght me e t  them? 

A: Wa s no sense to do it. No, no, it was not
 what you call -- what is that word? 
Q: An appointme nt? 

A: Yeah. It was spontaneous. 
You meet a person, as a group, 
group girls, group boys, and that 
can be on -- on the beach, or it can be in a mu
seum, it can be, I mean, wherever you -- you -- you 
meet, and wherever a person wants to talk. Becaus
e this is not always th
at you get luck. They -- 
they some times just walk away from you, becau
se a German in Holland, after all, was very 
weird. What does a German do in the war time -- that is an enemy. So you don™t speak with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
28 
 
 
enemies. But I mean, and you -- you had the -- l-lik
e I said before, you had Germans, and they -- 
they were shot at themselves. So they were eager to
 talk with us, so that we could feel that they 
were not enemies, but wi -- they were forced to 
be an enemy. That -- thatwas the fa scination that  
I always felt. So I always said, ﬁWell, after th
e war, you™re still my friend.ﬂ But see then, an 
NSB-er would not approve that. So you had to be
 careful in that group, th
at you was not with an 
NSB-er. As a ma tter of fact, when -- when we we re as Girl Scouts in the woods, and we -- we 

listened letzer rama phone in Dutch is it -- where you play -- 

Q: A record player. 

A: A record player, okay. We  had the record pl ayer, with Ir ish dances, Scottish dances, and we -- 

we were just doing that as a pleasure, as -- 
as a meeting on the -- th
at you -- that you learn 
some thing. But then, one day, there was a group of
 those NSB girls. Of course, they were 
aggressive, and said to us, ﬁYou 
are not supposed to listen to that
.ﬂ So we  said to them, ﬁ Who 
tells you to say that we are not listening?  We  are if
 we want to.ﬂ So then they started to fight. 
And I still reme mber I had a girl with a hand on he
r hair, I twisted her hair
 -- I still have a whole 
bunch of that -- and -- and poked he
r on the floor, and hit her, and 
kicked her, and they found out 
that we were not sissies. So 
they -- they disappear
ed in the woods, hollering, yelling. And we 
still listened to the music, and we still were da
ncing. Can you believe that you have that here?  Oh 
yeah, w-we -- I learned a lot, and 
I had not even studied karate yet.
 I did that here, just for the 
heck of it. But our fists -- I le
arned if you have a lot of rings, you can do more dama ge than there 
-- no rings, so we had always rings on. We ll that
™s -- that™s a certain weapon that the Germans 
used, to club you down. They had the -- the 
me tal thing, you know?  Cruel, but so what. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
29 
 
 
Q: When you were speaking with them, do 
you ever reme mber -- h-how do you -- how did you 
feel?  Do you ever reme mber feeling afraid, wh
en -- you know, this guy ha
s a lot of power, he 
could arrest  me if he felt like it. 
A: We ll, that™s what I say, I had no fear. And they 
were not that type. They 
were s -- just regular 
soldier boys from far ms, or nice families. They were decent. So you -- you -- you -- you could 

say anythi ng you want, because they would not do 
it. And that™s what I felt with them. They 
have no intention, because they rather talk with
 us, than their own creeps who were so fanatic. 
Kill, kill, ki ll. They were not that way. Otherw
ise, they would not be on the beach, period. But 
they had to be away from all the nasty stuff 
that they got back in their barracks. See? 
Q: S-So did meeting some  of these boys change 
your mi nd at all about the Germans?  Make them 

in a way mo re human? 

A: No. No, no. I told them from the beginning, if
 they ask me  for a date -- now, you have to 
understand, you have that uniform. If I get caught in
 that uniform, I know what to expect. So 
please, don™t pretend I™m stupid. And then they 
left. They say, ﬁYou are right.ﬂ But if I was 
forced, they would not have had me  alive, because
 I am not being forced to do what I don™t want 
to do. See, that boy that we had in
 the house was forced. We  had to. 
Q: Tell us aboo -- a bit about him.  

A: He -- he was -- 

Q: How -- when did he come? 

A: -- blonde, he was young. I think he was 22. He ha
d a farm close to Hambush, and if he was 
only -- if he alwa -- always cam
e back with some thing. Butter, eggs, whatever. And my father 
was, of course, ma d. He didn™t want  to accept it. I 
says to my father, ﬁDon™t be a st upid, that is 
eating stuff. Who cares where it comes from?ﬂ But, he
 had always girlfriends 
-- of course, in that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
30 
 
 
age, it™s understandable, who want
ed to talk with him. So my fa
ther would say either he was not 
home , or my  father would not understand the pers
on that called. He ha -- said it is the wrong 
number. I had once a girl in front of the house, 
and I stood opposite her, 
I said, ﬁDo you like to 
fight with me?ﬂ So she understood that I was not 
a doozie, either. So he didn™t have gi rls comi ng 
to the house, we warned him. Don™t even atte
mpt. You are just  tolerated. And you will be happy 
that you still living, because we could have cut y
our head off, put it under the house. Who was to 
find that out?  You could have been hit on th
e way to the barracks. There is no proof. 
Q: Do you reme mber his name ?  

A: No. Absolutely not. 

Q: S-So how did he show up one day? 

A: We ll, the army sent him. See, everybody had to
 have a soldier, because there were not enough 
barracks. And ma ybe it was to spy. To see what
 kind of fa mi ly he would live with. So, you 
know, you™re not stupid. If you have an enemy 
in your house, you are very careful. So I don't 
know if my father was listening to the BBC. In th
e meanti me  he left, because of course, they 
have to work, they o -- they don™t sit in -- 
in a small room, six by six like a prison, and do 
nothing. It™s a 22 year old, full of pep, and -- and -- a
nd likes to do all kind of physical stuff. But, 
I mean, you just had to tolerate. And he -- he wo
uld come  any time of the day, what pleased him, 
and you had to tolerate that. Now, our house w -- 
most houses in -- in Holland, has a stairway. So 
you -- you -- you have the living room, and then you 
go upstairs to the -- to
 -- to the bedrooms, 
that™s the way it --  it -- it is all 
built there. So, we didn™t have to 
meet him, if he stayed in his 
room, and we stayed downstairs, there was no wa
y, you know, unless he wanted to talk. But he -- 
he was, of course told by his superiors, don™t 
mi ng -- don™t mi x. Strictly obs
erve. That -- that™s -- 
Q: Did he ever eat with you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
31 
 
 
A: No. No, he ate in the barracks.
 The only way that he was with 
us, was to sleep, yeah. He -- he 
was showed souvenirs of stuff. I said, I™m sorr
y, don™t want it. He asked 
me out, I said no. Just 
like that. But he understood that. 
He was a very nice boy. I wish 
I could have dated him then. 
Oh. But you got to resist it. I had to. 
Q: That™s interesting.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: So he was an attractive young ma n? 

A: Oh, very. Germans are a very attractive -- no, r
eally. They have the -- the type of jaw. They 
ha -- blonde hair. They have that smile full 
with white teeth. I mean, I™ m -- I™m not, you know, 
what do you call it -- maybe I™m a -- a witch, but I 
have my emotions, I have my feelings, and 
I™m always in love. I™m in love with everybody. 

Q: That™s really interesting.  

A: But don™t -- don™t tell me  you cannot do this, 
because then I say, ﬁAha, you watch. I do it.ﬂ 
And I ma ke it that I do it. And th
at™s the only reason that I™m s
till living, probably, because they 
thought she -- she has some thing about her, you bette
r not fool around with her. I had an -- in my 
karate school, a guy -- now, at the time I was 65, I wa
s the oldest of that -- 
in -- in Foster™s High 
School. I ma de a side back kick. He could not come
 back in two weeks. My teacher told me  that. 
I said, ﬁBut I didn™t know that,ﬂ 
because you™re not supposed to l
ook, you just kick whatever you 
can kick. And if he was in my way, tough w
ith him. But I didn™t know that. So, you know, you 
use your elbow. How?  You use your hands for taking 
this thing, so that you have no -- no breath. 
You learn those things. We had a -- a survival co
urse in the Netherlands, with -- with the Girl  
Scouts. And boy, did I work that out beautiful. B
ecause you practiced on each other. Now, if you 
-- if you went too far, you would hear some thing. The teacher would then say, ﬁOh, you good. Y-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
32 
 
 
You -- you -- you graduate.ﬂ If that™s the word. So, I 
mean, that™s why my grip is still so firm. I f 
I have a hand, they say, ﬁGosh, are you 80? ﬂ They di
dn™t be lieve that. Because that is still in you. 
Q: Did you ever feel that any of your talks, or
 relationships, which sounded pretty specific, but 
did they ever -- did any of them kind of get 
out of hand, and you b -- start to like some one too 
much?  Whether it was a -- a -- a young ma n, oreven some one older, but -- but some body who 
was supposed to be the enemy --  

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- but that you perhaps starte
d really liking them too much? 
A: No, no. You didn™t go that far. 

Q: Okay. 

A: No, no. No, no. You did not ma ke yourself emotional. 

Q: Okay. 

A: If that person was nice, that was it, the end 
of the story. It was too 
dangerous. Can you believe 
he was involved?  Then -- then your -- your mi nd is
 different. That™s -- 
that™s the whole thing. 
You -- you can be very strong, in a certain way, but
 you got to keep that path. Because, if you go 
another way, you are lost. 

Q: But how did you know that?  I mean, how did you know? 

A: Instinct. Survival instinct, 
I think. Because I ha ve been very sexy looking. And I have been 
approached ma ny, many, ma ny time s. In -- in that
 -- oh, I forgot the tr
ain, that was another 
mome nt, di -- da -- I was looking 
in, a-and -- out of the window, and this soldier comes with his 
hands beside my cheek, against the window, and tr
ied to kiss me . In those days you had those 
shoes with high heels, like a pin. So I go very 
slowly down, while he was 
still trying to get my 
cheek, and I took my shoe, and I whacked him ag
ainst his you know what, banana. So he went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
33 
 
 
backwards on his back, and was yelling, ﬁOw, ow, 
ow,ﬂ because I hit the right spot. And in the 
meanti me , I went da da da da, dat da, dat da, 
to the other section of
 the trai n where were 
passengers. So he was finished yelling bloody murder, 
and then he went also
 in that, to find me . 
But he has ne ver seen my face. So I sat there between people, looking around like what?  Who?  
Me?  Don™t know nothing. So he -- he looked at
 me , but he didn™t know that was me .  
Q: And you kept a straight face? 

A: Of course. You cannot give yourself away. But 
I -- when he left, I laughed my hea d off. I 
laughed that the next two passenger looked at me  
like I was [indecipherable]
. Then I told that 
person. He said, ﬁYou dared to do that? ﬂ  That™s 
all I heard, ﬁYou dared to do that?ﬂ I said, ﬁI 
dare, if I have to.ﬂ  

Q: We ll, a question I have for you is why -- 
why do you think you dared, or some  -- ma ny peopl e 
dared, but ma ny people did not -- didn™t -- why do you thi -- 

A: We ll, not everybody™s strong. See, if you have 
a strong mi nd, it is -- it has to do with la -- 
religion, and my fa mily has a strong -- we have
 P- Presbyterian, and -- and you cannot tell me  
you want to become  a Jew, or you wa
nt to be -- that is just not th
e way. You have to believe first. 
And if right is right, and wrong 
is wrong, that™s just it. You d
on™t ask questions, you live with 
that. And that™s why my  f -- my father™s family wa
s also very strong, and were with this religion, 
or whatev -- but we stuck to that, and it gives yo
u inner strength. And I have never had fear. I tell 
you, I have no fear for biting dogs. I had once -- I 
was nine years old, and my father visited a 

friend, and he had a dog in a -- in a -- in a cage,
 and in Dutch, beware of dog. So, my father was 
there, and I looked around, right inside. And the 
dog was not doing anything. So I was there, my 
arms  around the dog™s head, and I kissed the dog. 
I was so -- so happy with that dog. So my 
father was finished, he look for me , and the owne
r of the dog got a fit. He said to me , ﬁDon™t you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
34 
 
 
read that sign? ﬂ  I said, ﬁYeah, I 
read it. So what?ﬂ Your -- I was 
nine years old, already so -- and 
the dog did nothing, absolute nothing. So my fat her 
said to that ma n -- ma ybe it was my father™s 
friend, he said, ﬁDon™t ma ke such a fuss about it. 
She is good with him. She is -- she is always 
good with animals.ﬂ And I had once a dog that att
acked me , and I had my fist -- now, you always 
have your thumb inside, not outside, 
but inside, and I put my fist in his mouth. Not, then the teeth 
cannot reach each other, so he was stuck. And then
 I grabbe d him with the back, and I lifted him 
up, I said, ﬁDon™t try it again, buddy.ﬂ So I took
 my hand out. Boy, did he go fast. He was 
scared. Because I did that, nobody else
 had done it. So that -- that 
is the way I am. If -- if you -- 
if you ma ke me  scared, I™ll let you know I am
 not scared, for whatever reason you tried.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of an interv
iew with Louise Segaar, it™s November 10
th
, in the year 
2000. We ™re at the United States Holocaust
 Memorial Museum. I -- I™m -- maybe I™m 
backtracking a little bit, 
but I wonder if you can tell me  a little 
bit more about the role faith did 
play in your fa mily, h -- when you were grow
ing up, when you were younger, how did you learn 
about it from your mother and father? 
A: Attitude . If they -- if they te
ll us not to do certain bad thin
gs, you listen. And their example is 
a fact. If -- if you beat a pers
on, you know it™s bad, but there must 
be a reason for doing that. So 
why would you do it in the first place, unless you 
are provoked, or attacked, or whatever reason. 
But that™s the only way you are allowed to do that, 
because the Bible says, love thy ne ighbor. It™s 
so simple. But people don™t follow that up. And th
at™s why you get all that me ss in the world. 

Why -- why would I be ma d at the Chinese perso
n, because the Chinese governme nt is doing this 
and that and that?  That poor Chinese person doe
sn™t know a thing about the government, and the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
35 
 
 
governme nt tells that person, you shall only have 
one child, you shall only have two childs -- 
children. For what?  Because the government is 
influencing. And I had 
the -- the Indonesian 
government, I had the Dutch government, I had th
e German government. Nobody tells me what I 
can or cannot do, if they don™t set 
their own samp le. I never go to church, either. I have been to 
church. One time I had a lady, her dress was way he
re so that you could see her things. Big hat 
with animal skin type of thing. Then my mi ni
ster, he went around his wife™s back fooling 
around. So when I was working in National airpor
t, he come s one day to my desk. ﬁLouise, do 
you reme mb er me ? ﬂ  I says, ﬁYeah, I do.ﬂ He says
, ﬁYou know what happened? ﬂ I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁMy -- my oldest boy got a car accident  and 
died.ﬂ So I grabbed his hand, I said, ﬁIs that 

punishme nt what you did to your wife is now back 
to your son? ﬂ And he looked at me  like, ﬁDid 
you know what I did then? ﬂ  I said, ﬁYeah, I know ever
ything,ﬂ I said, ﬁbut keep mouth shut.ﬂ He 
was very impressed. Ha-Ha-Had a gorgeous wife
, Barbara. So, no -- nobody is perfect, but you 
cannot feel superior either, because you don™t have
 the right to be. But if a person is suppressed, 
I fight for that person. And I don™t have to as
k anybody permission. If -- 
if you get hit on the -- 
on the street, I help. I go out, a
nd -- and get myself the dirty, w
ith blood, or whatever. You feel 
that it™s necessary, unless some one else is stabbi
ng you back, and say, ﬁShe killed him.ﬂ Then I 
fight. Because that happens a lot in this country. 

Q: You said if s -- if someone™s sup-suppresse
d, what was your sense of
 what was happening to 
Jews at that point, once the Germans moved 
in?  I mean, where -- what did you think was 
happening to them?  

A: They were warned. They were already told by the BBC that that would happen. Now, you can 

believe it, or you can say baloney. But if things
 happen, then you don™t th
ink any more  that is 
baloney. It happened. And then you start to be ca
reful, and you take measurements. You don™t sit 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
36 
 
 
back and wait, you act. And that 
is why, as a Girl Scout, the motto
 is, be prepared. That helped 
me  a lot. As a nurse, you always -- you always pr
otect the lesser -- sick mi nds, or sick body, or 
whatever, because you are the one 
is nursing that person. And you ca
nnot turn your back to that. 
It™s your duty to fight.  

Q: Can you reme mber back to your fi rst 
contact with the organized Resistance? 

A: The organized Resistance was already, the Girl
 Scouts. Because the leader of my t r oop was 
connected with the Red Cross. Now that™s interna
tional. So they get information. In those days 
you had no facts, you had no -- there™s no -- [indecipherable] goes with c
odes, by telephone. We  
-- we had, for instance, the alphabet in codes. If-- if -- if you sign, I -- you can sign with lights, 

blink, blink, blink. You can sign by sound, dit, dit dit di
t, dit dit dit dit dit. 
We learned that, see? 
With ar m signals. I -- I used to be on a tree, I ha
d the flag, I waved the flag, I would ma ke signals 
to another part of the city. 

Q: As a girl -- as a Girl Sc out? 
A: As a Girl Scout. 
Q: But then later as a Resistance person? 

A: As a Resistance -- you didn™t need to use th
at -- tha -- this -- this
 was playing, you know?  To 
learn.  

Q: Okay. 

A: But there you used other ways. 

Q: Oh, I understand, okay. So it in
troduced you to the idea -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- of -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. But that was all with the Girl
 Scouts, and I started that when I was 11.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
37 
 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: I started the hockey team when I was 11. It is 
a part of an educationa
l program. You can play 
soccer, what I did, too. I s -- I told
 you I was wild. I did everythi
ng what a normal girl would not 
do. But I had that energ
y. I -- I had to get away with that
, because I was bursting from energy. 
And if I didn™t beat my brother up, th -- I beat up
 something else. But th-that was to make -- just 
-- just to relieve yourself, perhaps. 

Q: So you™re saying that -- that --
 tell -- tell me a little
 bit more about how the structure of the 
Girls Scouts, and the sports teams wa s sort of us
ed. Not -- not necessarily 
exactly the way it was, 
but how was it used by the people who even
tually ended up helping so ma ny peopl e? 
A: We ll, it -- it was a kind of conscience that 
you had. A -- a -- an -- a Boy Scout, and a Girl 
Scout is prepared. Your conscience says, 
if some thing goes wrong, you -- you -- you find a way 
to correct it. So, it is bettering 
yourself. We  -- we had all those mo
ttoes, we -- we were like a few 
mi nutes in -- in prayer. That is up to you, to th
e person to do that. You was not forced to do that, 
but that was just a way of -- of -- of what happe
ned with the --  with th
e scouting moveme nt. So, I 
mean, it -- it was norma l , it was not particular
 odd thing, it was just
 the wa y it happened. 
Q: I™m -- I™m just trying to imagine it though, so
 you™re organized in th
e Girl Scouts, or y-you 
kind of inclined to be organized this way. When
 is the first time where -- or a first time that 
some one sa ys to you, I want you to do this, this, a
nd this, and you will be  helping because of that 

-- like, how is it explained to you? 

A: Okay, it was in a way that you had a choice. 
It was not like the Nazis did, you had to. You 
could do it. Lots of things we did to get a 
badge, for instance. You get a swi mmi ng badge, you 
get this badge, you get that badge
, oh, my arm wa s full of badges. 
So that is a kind of giving a 
bone to a dog that does a trick. That™s the way Ifeel it. But the leader was very good in that, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
38 
 
 
because she was, as a Red Cross person, aware that not everybody was capable. You -- you have 
people, they are not strong, you have people they
 are playing a coward, doesn™t admit it. But 
that™s the way they are. It™s just  thei r fa mily st
ructure is, or  whatever experience they ha d in life. 
And you fee l  well, don™t worry about that pers
on, that is just weak, you go on with a stronger 
person. And that™s what I think happened. I didn™t
 have to do it. I could turn my back, and not 
even talk about it, go home  and -- and read a 
book. But then I would s
it there with
 a book like 
they are doing things that I 
don™t ha -- do, and I will do it. So, you put your book away, and go 
and say, ﬁI™m here, I™m ready.ﬂ Whatever. 

Q: So, it was this woma n, who was the leader -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- with the re-R
ed Cross connection. 
A: I still have her name . 

Q: Oh you do?  What is her name? 
A: Yes. We  called her Rita. Now the first is -- th
e title is haupfrau, that is for you a strange, but 
that™s leaders name , and Rita
 Burgenberra-Fonde -- Fondeyong. 
Q: Say it one more time. 
A: Burgenberra-Fondeyong. That is typical Dutc
h. You would not be -- understand. I think I 
have here pictures with Girl Scout
s that I still have her on it. Let 
me  see. This is [indecipherable]. 
Why don™t you look at it?  [indeciphera
ble] are trying to open it, so 
all -- all with 
the escape to 
Canada. And this is Prince Banhurt, how he looks now
. Let me  see. Oh, here it is. This is her, 

and this is a Jewish girl, that
™s Hedda. And that™s the family 
that lived opposite us, our -- our 
house, Hedda Ricardo. And I asked the Red Cross if 
she still was living. I ha
ve other people that 
I wanted to know, but they have never answered me
. I have here all the name s of this bunch, this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
39 
 
 
-- this the nurses. See, I was he
re, and that was the children™s 
-- there was no Jewish person in 
there, but I wan -- and this -- this 
is me  in Indonesia. Isn™t that cu
te?  And this is my mother with 
me . This is my mother, my grandmother, and my
 mother-in- law, at the 
day that I got ma rried. 
See, I got ma rried by proxy, because my husband
 was already in Indonesia with the KLM.  
Q: Oh. 
A: And this -- this is then the oldest son with
 my  parents. And he is from a Jewish -- a 
Palestinian soldier. So he looks Jewish. But I have
 never heard from hi m, he just denied the fact 
that we had ever a relati
onship, so what can you do? 
Q: The son? 

A: No, the father of my son. 

Q: The father, oh. 

A: The father of my son. Yeah. And this was my 
father-in-law. Now, he was in a Jap camp, and 
he had [indecipherable] with his 
wrists wrapped with bamboo wra
pping, and then the branch of a 
tree, and his legs just above the ground. So he
 couldn™t touch the ground, and that was done for 
hours. And when he came  back to the Netherla
nds, he was a wreck. He had no -- no nerves any 
more, everything was like this, and we were cons
tantly told, you are too noisy, too noisy, too 
noisy. He -- he was absolute ruined. 

Q: Did he ever recover more? 

A: No, no, he died the same  wa
y. You -- th-there is nothing y
ou can do about it. This is my 
daughter-in-law when -- when she married 
my son. And we click like sisters. 
Q: She™s beautiful. 

A: Yeah. And this is the KLM. Yeah. And ther
e™s my hockey team. And here the Brownies. And 
this is where you get your wooden shoes 
ma de. And you see, all nurse™s stuff. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461

Q: S -- do you reme mbe r  what the first 
thing she asked you, or you decided to do? 
A: No. I have not the slightest idea, because 
so ma ny things happened, and -- and that time is 
better not to write things down, because you neve
r now who would find it. And my unc le, as I 
told you, was betrayed because he had said too much, so he was picked up at five in the morning, 
and go to Auschwitz. What -- I didn™t know at th
at time , I found it out when I was on vacation. 
And the Red Cross, after the war, gave my
 mother the possessions, like a pocketbook, or 
some thing, notebook, that was with his name  on 
it. So everybody was crying, and I didn™t know 
what to do. It was just such a shock, you know? 

Q: If y -- if y -- if you don™t reme mber a specific
 one, if you could just reme mber generally what 
it would be like, h-how would you -- how -- 
how would you communicat
e with your leader? 
A: On the meetings. 

Q: Okay. So when did you go to 
the meetings, what did you -- 
A: We ll, any time that you could 
do it. Officially, see, in -- in
 the Netherlands, your school is 
also on Saturday, until about one o™clock, and then
 you go to -- to this -- to the me eting. And we 
had off on Wednesday afternoons, so
 whatever time  you had -- of 
course, as a nurse, I was in 
another city anyway, but then you would cont
act people connected with the same  scouting 
organization, in that™s -- particul
ar spot. But as a nurse, as I to
ld you, I had two -- two shi-shifts, 
in those days the bombs were ru-run
ning around like crazy, so I had no time. 
Q: I-I-In -- if you could just give me  some  ex
a mples of kinds of things that you did. I mean, 
you™ve been doing that all along -- 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: -- but -- through the intervie
w, but if -- if you could -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
41 
 
 
A: Well, I reme mber that I had a 
bunch of Jewish kids, and we -- 
we spent time to get their star  
off of their costume, and then we told the 
kids what would happen 
to them. And we would 
contact the parents of those kids, and they w
ould approve. And we -- we gave them food, as I 
said, we -- we saved the coupons, and we would 
feed them. We would find homes where they 
could stay without that some one 
would be betrayed. So, it is a ma tter of ma king connections, and 
stick to those connections that 
you could trust. And if
 -- if one -- one child
 was then already 
under way to Great Britain, you would get another ch
ild instead. So it -- it was a ma tter of -- of 
planning, and timing, because one had to do this 
first, in orde r to do that. And it -- it was 
communication, and if you would hear some thing 
that was different, you would say that. I me an, 
if would be some thing being fouled up, because 
some thing happened unpredictable that -- that 
you didn™t count on that would 
happen. That was your duty t
oo, that you would say that, 
imme diately, so that that person could change qui
ck things around, but that 
-- that child would be 
still safe, see?  So, i-it wa s, in 
a way, working together, absolute 
like sisters, that you could trust 
any person, without any hesitation. And if I woul
d have found a person -- this -- this is for 
instance, my  -- my uncle™s death notice, then 
you would report that, and 
that person would get 
some  -- I don™t know what treatme nt, but they were
 kicked out. Because that person would be 

dangerous. But see, you had to watch everything
. Any -- any suspicious action, word -- action, or 
thought. 

Q: So you might be taking a child from where to where? 

A: To England. That was the only wa y. England wa
s the place where they would be, and then the 
-- 

Q: Where was the child, though, wh
en you got it -- at -- at a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
42 
 
 
A: In a house in Great Britain. 
And underway with a person that would lead them underground. 
They were usually me n, young me n. And they spoke 
French and Spanish, that was a must. So, I 
have never found out how that happened, because 
I was not told, see?  But I knew that they 
would reach their goal, because then from the 
BBC, you would hear that certain families had 
arrived safely. And then you would say ahhhhh, 
like that, you know?  You would be so happy, 
because you -- you did something, that was accomplished.  

Q: S-So you™ve actually been listen -- you were
 listening to the radio, 
and you heard the name , a 
fa mily name , of some one that you helped? 

A: Yeah, yeah. And then that -- that
 particular  family was still in 
Holland. So they got their turn 
to go, and meet their kids there. It wa s very, very
 -- how shall I put that? It -- it was some thing 
that you didn™t hesitate to do it. It -- it 
was some thing like sleeping, and eating, and drinking. 
And if you had to work, okay, that wa s the first thi
ng. I mean, as a nurse, I had to do that, what -- 
what the hospital told me  to do. But in your spare time, you did things like that. You had no time 
to -- to play Monopoly, or whatever
. It -- it was just to save as ma ny lives as you could do that. 
And you didn™t ask any thanks in w -- in -- 
in return. I cannot reme mber fa ces, I cannot 
reme mber names. I got this little round thing 
to -- to thank, so what, you know?  You have the 

inner satisfaction, that™s a
ll. I can live with it for the rest of my life.  
Q: How long did this go on? 

A: Until the war was finished. When we were lib
erated, they were still shooting. I reme mber I 
was meeting a tank, I planned to get on it, what 
I never could do, because 
it™s o-overloaded with 
people. But left or right, th-the
 Germans were still shooting.  
Q: How -- how -- describe if you can how you used
 your job as a nurse, some times, apparently -- 
A: You just did it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
43 
 
 
Q: How did you do it?   
A: We ll, you -- you get assigned cert
ain ward, a certain patient. That
 -- that was just that the 
hospital works with. And I have my me mory with 
a guy that tried to get his hand under my skirt. 
And I had a water pitcher to fill out his -- his glas
s, instead of the glass, he got it. So he was 
soaked wet, and I said to him, ﬁYou™ d ha -- 
keep your mouth shut, cau
se that™s what you 
deserve.ﬂ So he was drenched, and then the -- 
the -- if I was a night nurse, the morning nurse 
would have find out naughty, naughty, 
naughty, but he didn™t have the 
nerve to tell her that I did 
it. 

Q: But you mi ght get assigned a -- some one at 
the hospital, and would you eventually ma ybe 
help that person hide, or -- 

A: This -- this -- this is the ward, huh? 

Q: Okay. 

A: So you was assigned to a ward for children, 
or you was assigned to a ward with me n. No, to 
be honest with you, I was 18, I think I was -- 19. I 
had never had a ma n nude. So you are put in a 
ward with nothing but nude, embarrassed guys. On
e had the banana like this, one had like a 
peanut, one had nothing. You know, and they feel
 bad about me , because I was a 19 year old, 
fresh kid that is supposed to touch the guy, and wa
sh it. So, I mean, I learned with a big shock, 
like oh my God, what did I do now, you know?  But you 
-- you -- you learn to just accept it, and -
- and that™s -- that™s your job, 
you know?  But is so [indecipherable], 
but you have to learn fast.  
Q: So, bu -- would the children in
 the hospital ever be Jewish? 
A: We  had, in 1945, I was assigned to a ward w
ith 50 babies. Those babies were underfed. You 
don™t ask how, you know it happens. So, if they ha
d no tattoo, it could be a Dutch baby. If they 
had a tattoo, you was aware that
 was a baby that was taken fro
m a Jewish home, or from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
44 
 
 
Auschwitz. In those days, everything was chaos,
 unpredictable, you didn™
t know if the stories 
what went around was rumor or truth. But you had 
to do what the nurse is supposed to do. We  
had no coffins any more , for instance. Coffins 
were out of the questi
on, because there was no 
wood. So we wrapped dead body in a cloth or pape
r, and -- and then it was -- if you know. Yeah, 
in my ward were ma ny, ma ny who -- who died, 
and was very emotional, but what can you do, 
you know, you™re not God. 
Q: But when you say yo-yo-you don™t ask, but you know
, I mean there™s a good chance that a lot 
of those babies that were be
ing undernourished, were Jewish.  
A: That was not the rule, cause everybody in Ho
lland was undernourished. If you was fat, I was 
supposed to be fat, okay?  That has to do w
ith the type of food, you only had soup. Anything 
what you ate was soup. And if you k
now me dical structure of a pers
on™s body, it -- it sets in your 
-- in your skin, it sets in your ne
rves, it sets in your -- in your 
fat -- you call it edemish. You put a 
-- a thumb on some one™s skin, and it
 would stay. So that means that
 is an impression of a person 
that has too much fluid in the body. And that 
was the only food you had anyway, so what can 
you do?  I had pea soup, I had this soup, I had th
at soup, I -- but at leas
t you had soup. You -- you 
-- you went out to the street, and 
get the leaves from the trees, 
cook them, that was soup. People 
don™t understand that here, because you have so -- everyt hing, you know?  You have so much 

choice. When I went in the store after the -- th
e -- that we came from Holland, I couldn™t believe 
my eyes. I said to my husband, ﬁGod, we should ha
ve had all that stuff during the war.ﬂ Because 
the shelves were with all of those different bran
ds of -- of food, and cans, and oh, what a choice 
you had. It was amazing. But so what?  It was all vitami ns, perhaps. 

Q: How -- how did you feel, 
physically during the war? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
45 
 
 
A: Fantastic. Very s -- very strong. If you were 
sick, you had no chance. So that again, is in your 
mi nd, don™t get sick, because then you™re not effective. And, as a nurse, I chose that profession. 
It sounds -- it sounds -- what 
is that word?  Egoistisha -- 
Q: E-Egoist? 

A: Egoistic. Self preserve nt. But that™s the 
only pl ace you got food. And r eally, I had farmers, 
they visited their -- their fa mily
 when they were sick, and they were prepared to give us 
pancakes, so I had -- you know, your uniform is with
 white, huh?  I had five pancakes here, and 
that™s greasy stuff. So the -- just the -- 
the -- on uniforms, nothing 
but grease dripping, but 
nobody said anything, everybody was laughing, because you did it. And if some one said, ﬁI hope 

I™m out of this.ﬂ Oh, here. No a -- no questions 
asked. I was once in a pl ace where you have the 
latrines, had the -- the bedpans. So I come  in 
running, you always ran to, and then s-stapled up 
three, and -- and -- on each other, 
that™s always the way you have to be strong. And th-the ward™s 
head nurse, I hated her, but it was so funny. 
I tell you, I was laughing, and I dropped all those 
bedpans on the floor, because I got a fit from 
laughing, and that™s me , you know, then -- and she 
stood there, a huge woman, six foot
 some thing, and really big. A
nd she had both cheeks like this, 
and I asked her something. I™m -- I™m a nasty 
person, I aske d her because I knew she couldn™t 
talk. So, she opened her mouth with that yellow 
stuff comi ng out of her teeth from the egg, and 
she said, ﬁGet back.ﬂ I said, ﬁI
 want to ask you some thing.ﬂ I st
ood there, I didn™t go out. I just 
put her on the spot. Oh, did she 
hated me . So I asked her the 
question, she could not answer, 
unless all that egg was first 
out. So I went back to th
e ward, I™m washing out the 
[indecipherable]. And I had curfew, you could not 
go out certain time, and you had to bay -- b -- 
be back in a certain time , too. Yeah, you stopping?

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is an interview with Louise Seg
aar, conducted by Katie Davis, on Nove mber 10
th
, in the 
year 2000, at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Th
is is tape number three, side A.  You were 
talking some about the different 
kinds of things that you mi ght 
do -- that you mi ght get asked to 
do. Wa s there any pattern to it, or -- or how w
ould y -- how would you -- what did you expect in 
a given week?  That you would have 
some thing that you™d have to do? 
A: We  didn™t expect nothing, because things
 ha ppened which you didn™t expect. Simple. 
Everything was unpredictable. In -- in a war,
 you cannot plan anythi
ng. If you plan some thing, 
then some thing around you happens, and then you ha
ve to change, so you just live what you call 
day by day, mi nute by minute. And if not
hing happens, fine, you was lucky.  

Q: W- Woul d you ever be at the hospital, and -- 
and have someone come  up and sort of get a 
me ssage to you that some one needed to talk to you? 

A: No, no, no, no. Because they knew that the hosp
ital was my future. I mean, I was a student , 
you have to learn lots of thi
ngs. You -- you are a involved with
 lifes, and medication. I mean, 
you could not be distracted from 
what actually the goal of yourlife was. And I felt that, as a 
nurse, you could use it for later, if the war was fini
shed, for whatever purpose. I still have use for 

it, because it™s the experience you get. I know how 
to treat it, I know how 
to treat that. I never 
walk to a doctor. So, it -- it is very -- you know, 
it -- it is -- it is a ni
ce occupation, that you can 
use.  

Q: That™s actually interesting to me  that you 
didn™t get bothered when you were at work. So, 
there were some  clear boundaries about
 what was safe, or okay, or -- 
A: No, no, because I -- I saw like a girlfriend went  
on her bi ke, from one point -- from -- of the 

city to another, and she got hit by -- by a -- an
 -- a shell, and what can
 you do?  I me an, I didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
47 
 
 
even know she was there, but you hear that la
ter on, you know, sometime s months later. But you 
-- you -- you can cry, but you cannot change it. So, 
it -- it was shocking. S- Saw some  t hings that 
you didn™t expect. So I -- I -- I hoped to -- 
to see her back again, but you never knew. 
Q: Wh- Who in your life kne
w about what you were doing? 
A: I would say the leader of 
this Girl Scout troop, yeah. 
Q: Okay. And what was her name  again? 
A: Rita Burgenberra-Fondeyong. Let me  see, I ha
ve some thing here, cause I didn't know if I 
needed this. I write everything down. Let me  see 
where you are. There she is. Haupfrau Rita -- 
actually name  is Maria Katarina
 Burgenberra-deyong. You can keep this, or -- or copy it. She 
was born the first of August, and she died 22
nd
 -- on the 12
th
 of August, in ™95. Now this is her 
sister, who wrote it to me . Her si
ster lives on that address, because
 in ™95, of course, I was here. 
But she mi ght have names, and -- and -- and addre
sses from people fr-from that time. Now this is 
my uncle, that™s the sit -- the brot her of my moth
er. He died at Auschwitz concentration camp, in 
1941. See, I -- I hope to write a book, if I find a pers
on that can help me  out, because I have not 
the slightest idea how to start, but
 that™s why I ma de all those notat
ions, yeah. I was in that -- that 
is -- that is a school of -- home economics is that
 in English. So I did that before I went as a 
nurse. You -- you ma de cakes from tulip bulbs, 
spinach from tree leaves. You had no butter, you 
had no sugar, no chocolate. There were no coffins, 
bodies were wrapped in paper. Now, that was 
in ™42, so it™s -- it started to become  nasty. 
In the beginning you didn™
t notice much, but it -- it 
builded up, because we were resisting. If we di
dn™t resist, everything woul d have been more 

pleasant. No heat in the house, which in the bedr
oom was frozen this thick. Oh yeah, then here I 
was in the staff of the kitchen, in mo ylon that is
 that house for old people. And then I was in the 
train to The Hague, when German tried to kiss 
me  while I stood at window. Smashed with high 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
48 
 
 
heeled shoe in his banana. And then I saw a blit
zed plane that was shot down, and the pilot was 
still in his seat, but he was black, ashed, you 
know?  And then you would put your finger against 
that, and your finger would have the ash, like onAsh We dnesday. That™s -- the Catholics do. But 
he was still intact, was amazing. Yea h, and -- an
d the German said, ﬁOkay, you can see it.ﬂ  
Q: Let me  a sk you a bit more about her. 
Where did your Girl Guide leader live? 
A: In The Hague. This is -- this
 is all -- see, in The Hague. 
Q: Okay, so she lived in The Hague. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: How old was she?  You were 20. 

A: We ll, she was born in 1904, and she died 1995. So
 she was pretty old. Can that be? Yeah, that 
can be, can be. ™95, subtract that from ther
e. So in the 90™s, roughly. Thi-This is -- 
Q: So she was about 10 years older than you? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay. 
A: Yeah. Now this is the harch sistikting forhoup 
and roterdumpser escapees, or -- what -- what 
is that here?  If -- if you flee. Re
fugees. And this was the leader w
ho gave me  that -- that little 
gadget, that -- Eugene, see, he was French. Sorti
ng out worn clothing to size, at refugees home, 

and s-stuff like that. 

Q: So when you still went to a Girl Guide m
eeting, would you leave the hospital, and put your 
Girl Guide outfit on? 

A: No, no, no, no, no. See, this Girl Guide st
uff was before I went as a nurse.  
Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
49 
 
 
A: Because then I did not live in The Hague. No
w, on vacations, if I had time to visit them, I 
would do that, but Haarlem, that is where -- where 
the hospital was, is entirely di fferent area. But 
of course, she went on with her Girl Scout s, so we -- we -- we kept in touch.  

Q: Did she ever talk about -- without being really
 explicit, but did she ev
er talk about what she 
was doing?  

A: No, no, no, no, no, never. I only, because I™m so 
inquisitive , I find out 
things. But I did not 
want to let her feel that I was 
investigating, it was just
 that I was curious,  I wanted to know. 
Q: What did you find out about her? 

A: In -- in -- in those days, you didn™t do things, 
if a person didn™t want you to do it, because she 
had a highly sensitive position. If --if -- with the Red Cross, that 
that is international, you have 
to be very careful. So she -- she -- I think she ne
ver told anybody that she 
was a Girl Sc out leader 
to begin with, that would have been so stupid. But 
if you deal with -- with -- with kids, so what, 

who cares what you do?  You know, you play with 
them, and you keep them happy, and -- and -- 
and -- and don™t ask for political 
things. So, no, I -- I was not that close with her. She was what 
you call a very strict disciplinarian, what was goo
d, and that™s ma ybe why she ma de me the way 
I am, but I had the greatest respect, and you did not
 backtalk with her. 
She was that type of 
person, oh yeah.  
Q: What did you call her? 

A: Haupfrau. 

Q: Haupfrau. Haupfrau -- 

A: Perhaps you think -- 

Q: -- what does that me a n, Haupfrau? 

A: Haupfrau.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
50 
 
 
Q: Leader? 
A: I think that it™s a nickname , and -- and you 
don™t use that here, beca
use I was here a Girl 
Scout, too. It is typical, and how should I say th
at?  If -- if you like a 
person a lot, that you 
nickname  in -- in a nice way, sweet, you know, lova
ble. So, I think we invented that name . 
Maybe she didn™t like it, but she neve
r said that she didn™t like it.  
Q: So you said that you investigated, even  though she was pretty private. H-Ho -- 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Oh. 

A: International. ™31. 

Q: How -- how did you sn -- how did you find out 
what you did find out a
bout why she did it? 
A: Just for asking. I™m not sneaky, I just ask, and 
if they don™t want to say anything, fine. And if 
they say, ﬁWhy would you know? ﬂ  I say, ﬁBecause 
I™m curious.ﬂ Or -- or I™m interested. 
Q: Did you ever see her after the war -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- so you could talk
 to her about it? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: No. 

A: No, because see, then I moved. I never finish
ed my -- my  nursing exam, because it was chaos, 
and as I told you, I was in love, the heck with th
e exam, so I -- I never got my degree. But I feel, 
if you have experience, that should do it. And the 
hockey stuff also, they --
 they kept  writing, and 
sending pictures with. It is impo
ssible, because he re, not only you 
immi gr ate, but you are all of a 
sudden bang, in everyt hing, you know. Because you are new, and you meet people, they want to 

know everything about you. So I -- 
I was a celebrity, and as I told
 you, I did all those courses.

You -- you™re just having a job, taking care of
 your boys, your husband needs to be fed, he 
doesn™t do a darn thing, he didn™
t -- didn™t do the -- the yard, or 
anything, so I kicked him out. 
Can you believe that, he said, ﬁI
f we come  to the States, you ar
e not allowe d to learn how to 
drive a car.ﬂ So, I waited until he went to his 
job in Wa shington Nationa
l Airport, with United 
Airlines, and I looked in 
the Yellow pages, and I called some one
 that is offering driving lessons. 
So there™s a guy, gives me  seven lessons for five 
dollars per hour. I went solo to D.C., came  out 
alive, back home . And I said to my husband, ﬁI
 did it.ﬂ Boy, he was exploding. Then, I was not 
allowed to get a job. So, when he went to wo
rk, I went with my car, where my new license, 

parked in the parking lot, went inside, with my
 little ad I found. They needed a person for Mutual 
of Omaha. So I knocked at the door, the guy 
opens the door, he said, ﬁOh, you want a job, you 
are hired.ﬂ And I stayed for 31 year
s. I still see hi m, and write Ch
ristma s cards, and talk with his 
wife. She is Scottish, he™s -- he is American, they
 live in Alexandria. But I always asked him, I 

said, ﬁWhat did you see in me ?  Why did you hire
 me  so fast?ﬂ He said, ﬁBecause you acted 
cute.ﬂ And his wife was laughing. She said, ﬁYeah, 
I think same  way.ﬂ And I saw the roma nce in 
the airport, because he always went to her count
er. I said to him, ﬁUh-uh, that™s not the way to 
go, that™s the way to go, that™s your office.ﬂ 

Q: So basically, if some one tells you not to 
do some thing, you -- you™re going to go ahead and 
do it. 

A: That seems to be the way it happens. Because 
I never thought why I would not work to help 
my kids to go to college, or to get some thing 
for the house, or -- I mean, I™m not a slave, but I 
showed him that I was not a doorma t, either, even
 I was ma rried to him. So he was upset. He 
said, ﬁYou don™t obey me .ﬂ I said, ﬁFor what?  I™m 
not in Indonesia.ﬂ Yea
h, that™s the way I am. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
52 
 
 
Q: We ll, tha -- this kind of links us, in a wa
y, to orders, you know, when you get orders, when 
you™re in what -- volved with wh
at you were in, if you got an or
der, you did have to do it.  
A: Yeah, but that™s different.  
Q: Okay, how? 

A: That is an order that ma kes sense, that has 
a purpose. But to say you cannot drive, just for the 
fact that I™m your wife, the hell with 
you. E-Everybody drives. How can you -- how can you 
walk from one point to the other? And I hate bu
ses. I hate to be dependent on some thing. I™m a 
very in-independent person. And if you say you cannot 
do this, I say, I do it. 
That -- that has been 
my whole life. And my father can 
tell you that too, if he was still 
living, because that is just the 
way I am. And ma ybe it™s because of all the stuff th
at I have experienced, that it -- that it made 
me  that -- that way. 

Q: How would you get orders from your
 higher ups, to do certain things? 
A: I only listen if you are nice, if you say it 
in a wa y, can you please do this, then I do it. 
Q: But I me an in -- dur -- during the war, like,
 ho-ho-how would you even hear that you were 
supposed to do some thing?   

A: I felt is an honor. An honor that I was asked 
to do that, and I would do a good job about it. Of 
course, you don™t have the schooling, you have no e
xperience. You do the -- the way -- the best 

that you can do it, but if it come s out right, then
 you get a me dal. And you win -- you win TV™s 
and stuff like that, I think. That
 is it, an -- an accomplishmen
t. But I don™t do anything just 
because they ask. It has to have common sens
e first. Because  otherwise, you do some t hing 
against your will, and that™s not me. 

Q: Can you tell us about any close 
calls you had?  Get into some  --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
53 
 
 
A: Well, if you call that a close cal
l, that -- that -- that
 soldier in the train, 
but I never felt it that 
way. No, I -- I feel very religious 
about it, I feel I have been prot
ected. I never really had a close 
call. I could have been killed ma ny time s, but because
 of -- of the intuition, or the insight feeling 
that you get about a certain happe
ning, or a certain person, I thi
nk that™s the warning, and then 
you just be careful. 
Q: So do you feel some  -- in some  way, you were warned some ti me s? 

A: Maybe -- ma ybe -- yeah, ma ybe that twofee, t
oo, that got a shell in 
the house. You could say 
that is a close call. But see, 
I don™t see it that way, 
because the ma ttress wa
s between the shell, 
and the shell stuck in -- in the roof, and didn™t go
 down, didn™t fall all the wa
y, see, so -- and then 
-- and then we -- and that was funny, too. We  we
re -- we were moved -- that -- that™s also 
governme nt ordered, because the house was impossible to fix. So we moved to a family, and 

they had the pear tree, full of p
ears, in -- in their yard. Now, in
 those days, if you had that guy™s 
pear, you got shot at. So, his son -- I never forget
 that, but his son was about my age, too, he was 
always in the kitchen door with 
the rifle. I said to him, ﬁHe
y, you have nothing better to do? ﬂ But 
-- but -- but -- but what I do go ge
t you a pear. I wouldn™
t even touch it, but I can look at it. 
Yeah, you have crazy people. Hot, he was so cr
azy about his pears, I said, ﬁ When do you finally 
start to eat the darn things?ﬂ Because the pear
 has to be ripe and fall out anyway. Oh, oh, oh. 
Q: Can you talk a little bit 
about friendships you ma de with people who were doing similar 
things to what you were 
doing in the Resistance? 

A: The only friendships that you 
could have was in the hospital as a student nurse, and I was 
with friends in that -- in that hospital for olde
r people, and of course, the sports. Had lots of 
friends. Girl Scouts, you kept friends for years.
 But see, you -- you -- you -- either they move, or 
they get married, so then the -- their name chan
ges. And when I moved, I  tried to keep up with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
54 
 
 
all those people, but it™s -- you -- 
you ha -- [indecipherable] work to
 write. And if they have no 
time to write back, you just have to give up, or 
you write a Christma s card 
with love, your name , 
and that™s it. No, I™m not  a person that -- that st
ays up for 24 hours to keep friends. If the friends 
wa-want to be a friend, I am loyal to that person, a
nd if that person is not l
oyal, fine, that™s their 
business. 
Q: We re you ever trained in any 
way, to do anything that you did? 
A: I think the experience is the training. You 
do some thing, and then see what will happen. And 
otherwise, the student stuff wa
s experience, and -- and you learn how to be prepared during 
scouting, and you smash some one™s knees when you -- you -- you play hockey. I wound always 

u-up in -- in -- in the back of the goal, because  I was so fast, I couldn™t make myself s t op. So 

they couldn™t find me , and I heard them yelling, 
ﬁLukie, Lukie, where are you? ﬂ And then the -- 
was behind the -- the goal, and I was entangled in 
-- in -- in the goal net,
 because I coul dn™t get 
out of it. But that was the only way, you know. Y
ou -- you kept friends wi
th people that you are 
working with, or laughing with, 
or experiencing with. Oh boy, I know
 I had always fun. I always 
-- and that -- that makes you weak, because I ge
t weak from laughing. My grandmother was that 

way, too. 

Q: Really? 

A: We  always laughed. We had gossip about aunt th
is, about uncle that, a
nd then all of a sudden, 
you -- you would have silence, and then you would 
hear something, like this
 -- this bottle went 
upside down on the seat, and that was -- I don™t 
explain it. But I mean, that -- that was our 

fa mily. Oh boy, and my mother also, she would ha
ve her hands over the stove to keep warm, and 

then we would gossip again about this, because th
at™s all that you could do in those days, is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
55 
 
 
gossip, because you -- you couldn™
t do nothing, nothing else. My 
mother had no job, and my 
father would come home  with a -- 
a face like, is the food ready?   
Q: Tell us -- you haven™t really -- we™ve me n
tioned him a couple time s, but I wonder if we 
should tell us the story of your uncle. You know, le
t™s give his name , and describe a little bit 
about what he did, a
nd how he ended up -- 
A: Two -- two uncles. Two uncles. 
Q: -- in Auschwitz, okay. 

A: Yeah, because I don™t know.  

Q: But let™s tell both. 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: Okay. 

A: I only know that -- 

Q: Just say what you do know. 
A: -- he -- he was picked up at five in the morning. 
Q: Which one is this? 

A: That was the older. That was Alder Young. My
 mother™s oldest. And I found that out after I 
came home from -- I think that was the nursing 
time , and my mother had those items in her 
hands, and she was -- she -- in -- you -- some time s
 it was so emotional you couldn™t talk. So I 
had it -- to find out from my father, who finally 
talks way after that, but we have never found out 
if he was ill, or that  he died in -- in the real
 gas chambers, what we didn™t know at that time, 

either. Everything was after the war, that you 
heard about that. And 
I always thought, how a 
huma n being can invent that. I was absolute pe
rplexed, because a nurse 
is a nurse. Is healing. 
You don™t invent all that cruel stuff. You don™t 
-- you don™t expect that to happen. So, we never 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
56 
 
 
got his body. The other uncle, of course, was kill
ed on -- on -- on the tarma c  of the airport, so 
that was a body, but that cousin that was 15 y
ears in a Jap camp, we wer e  told -- again, I don™t 
know the truth, that he was just killed by -- 
by not being fed, not getting food, so he was 
malnutrition. 
Q: Th-The one who was killed on the tarmac? 

A: That was my youngest uncle. 

Q: And wha t  was his name ?  

A: Edward. That is from this advertisement. 

Q: And whe r e was he killed? 

A: In Eepenberg, that is close to a place in 
the ha -- The Hague, a suburb of The Hague. 
Q: So they™re both Dutch citizens? 

A: Yes, oh yeah. My family. 

Q: But no, I know, but I™m -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- just -- the Dutch cit -- 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: So what would have necessitated 
them being picked up in any way? 
A: He was -- they were betrayed. They had -- th
e uncle that went to Auschwitz was like me , 
underground, but at that time, I 
didn™t know that, because we didn™
t talk. And the offi ce where he 
worked -- I -- I don™t even know wha t  office th
at was, was a guy who was me mber of the n -- 
NSB. So, when my uncl e  talked, he mi ght have b
een not careful. He was betrayed. Now, at that 
time, I didn™t know that. I didn™t 
know about the under -- other uncle, 
until later, I was told that 
he was shot. And then in -- years later, my father 
ma iled that to me , that little thing, and I kept it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
57 
 
 
at -- all the time, because it is pa
rt of history. Now, he was a capta
in, he was in -- in the -- in the 
Dutch army, and he was very brave.  
Q: Wa s your father in the underground? 

A: He was -- no, but he was -- he 
was secretary of -- of that orga
nization like here the Triple A 
is. But, because of his looks -- he looked younger th
an the age of a person that was sent to work 
in a German factory. He just -- I 
think he grew his ber -- beard, or
 whatever he did, in order to go 
to work without the second experience of being 
picked up. Because he -- he kept going to the 
office, to do his job, but he was not done being 
picked up again. Or ma ybe he got such a shock 
that he grow older, I don™t know
, but that -- that was happening in
 those days, so you didn™t see 
ma n betwee n 16, and I think it was either 45, or
 55. So you saw only real old me n, and me n of 
my age, you -- you saw after the -- 
the dark fell in, and then you da
red to go out, because I still 
dated some how. And -- and of course, those boys 
on the hockey field, they dared to go out and 
play hockey, even they had the chance to go out
 to the factory in Germany. But, see y-you got 
bolder by the day. Do you think that you -- you 
-- you -- you thought that the -- the Germans 

could do all those things, yo-you just
 thought they were -- 
they were me ntally sick and said those 
things, but you didn™t obey them, you laughed in 
their face. Yeah, you can 
laugh now, but that™s 

how I lost a lot of boyfriends. I reme mber I was in
 love with a -- with a 
guy, and he always tried 
to bring me  home . And then all of a sudden, I went
 back to play hockey, and he was not there. So 

some one said yeah -- what was his name  again?  I forgot. But he was the guy that went via 

Belgium, and France, and the Pyrenee, and -- and 
Spain, to England, and then he got caught in -- 

in that time, but I have never found out how he got
 caught. That was just one of those news that 
you picked up, and you knew that was the guy that you 
liked so much. So it 
was -- it was very 
tragic. That™s why it was difficult to have your 
emotions pointed at some thing, because it never 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
58 
 
 
lasted. And -- and you had no control about anyt
hing. If you tried to, you -- you had to change 
with a grudge, but so what, it changes, and ther
e is nothing you can do about it. That is just the 
end of that period. So I think I gr
ew faster for my age than any pe
rson here in the United States 
ever will, because of all the pa
in there, that you endur
ed, and I was too strong to admit it. But I 
got stronger, I c
ould feel that.  
Q: What was it like right when you were doing 
some thing, when you -- you had a kid who really 
was Jewish, and should have had a star, and 
you were getting the kid to some body™s house -- 
A: Oh, that was a challenge, no doubt
 about that. Yeah, you still have 
a star?  Forget it, off. I just 
ripped it. But you see, th-the -- the seam™s still on
 -- on the thing, so they -- he had to ha ve the 
new jacket. And we -- we -- we hide
d all that stuff, we just hide
d it. Oh no, you had to act fast. 
Maybe you could say I was impulsive, but to me, to -- 
to wear that, that -- 
that -- that was plain 
suicide, and you don™t let that ha
ppen, no way. Oh yeah. But see, 
if you get -- the guy is six feet 
tall, with -- with boots, that even a snake don™
t -- doesn™t bite through, and you have a -- a -- a -- 
a rifle that we ighs ma ybe a hundred pounds, or
 80 pounds, I think it is
, y-you cannot just, you 
know, do certain things, and -- and get yourself in 
trouble, because then y
ou out of -- of -- of -- 
of a useful life, because you™ve -- you have to feel us
eful. It -- it is -- it 
is a -- a -- I would almost 
say, even, I™m not a church goer, that you have from
 the Lord, a test in your life, and it depends 
on how --  how you beat that test, 
that you™re a failure, or that you
™re a accomplisher. That™s the 
way I feel. Everything 
in life is a test .  
Q: We re there time s that when you were doing thi
ngs, that you were sort of filled with a -- a 
feeling that you were under God™s care, 
or that you were on a mi ssion, or -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, I ca -- I could feel it
. I still feel  it. I still feel  it. 
And -- and just little things. For 
instance, I™m -- I™m not rich. I have no job, so 
I depend on Social Security, and a sma ll pension, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
59 
 
 
what I had to fight for -- was a lawsuit, you know
. And a s mall investme nt. But I can ma ke it. I 
have no -- no -- what you call big debts, and 
some rich people that, boy they -- they -- 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de B 
Q: This is a continuation of tape three, side
 B, interview with Louise Segaar, Novemb er 10
th
, in 
the year 2000, at the United Stat
es Holocaust  Memorial Museum.  
A: I could use some , but I have a credit that is 
excellent. My bank has me  
on a senior citizen -- 
what you call that?  Status. So I have, of course, to
 have a certain amount, so
 that overdraft is not 
tolerated, but I never have  an overdraft, because I 
calculate my expenses before I even put it in 
the ma ilbox. I mean, you have to think. And if ther
e is an expense that is before a certain time 

limit, I call that person, can you ex
tend it a little bit longer?  No 
problem, as long as I keep in 
touch that I will pay. It™s -- it™s
 -- everything is so simple, real
ly. I don™t me -- money is like a 
game . You get money, and you spend money. But it™s 
just the -- the -- what
 is that word now?  
That it™s balanced properly. 

Q: Have you ever come  across any people who 
you helped rescue, that have identified 
themselves to you? 

A: No, never. It™s because life goes so fast, and 
your life changes, your physical changes, your -- 
what is that -- your interests ch
anges, too. And I found out that lots of people are very absorbed 
in their own fa mily. And if you say some thing, oh th
at™s nice, but so what? That™s your business. 
So, that -- that is with everybody. I -- I noticed 
that with my next door 
neighbors. I have a -- a 
bunch of Bolivians, and they speak only Spanish,
 but there™s one guy that I speak English with. 
They are very nice, and they™re totally different
 from the other neighbors. But they have their 
own problems. I noticed that, they have problems, 
but I keep my big mouths shut. And if they -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
60 
 
 
if -- if they know how to solve it. For instance, they -- they™re --  they™r e not -- new in this 
country, so they don™t know laws. So the other da
y, their dog goes out without
 the leash. I said to 
the guy, ﬁYou better watch out th
at the policema n is not passing, because you get hundred 
dollars fine, and you mi ght have that the dog will
 be impounded.ﬂ And he asked me  what is -- 
what is impounded?  So he didn™t know that. But now
, the -- the dog is with a leash, and he is in 
the yard, and he is grateful, but he
 doesn™t show that. It™s just that
 I felt obligat ed to pr otect that  
poor dog, because I love animals, and if that poor
 -- that Bolivian is not familiar with laws, I 

have the duty to tell him, to pr
otect that he get in trouble. So 
they are nice people, very polite. 
But we -- we don™t do anything voluntarily t-to --
 to get mor e  friendly. Le t me  put it that way. 
They are on that side of the fence, and I am 
on this side. Plenty to 
do. I never sit still.  
Q: How about -- did you ever come  across some
one that you -- that you worked with in the 
Resistance, who was some one like you?  No. 

A: No. Totally out. 
Q: So when the war ended, what happened? 
A: Nothing. I immi grated.  

Q: Pretty much? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Pretty much, that™s what happened? 

A: We ll, that was our goal. 

Q: Yeah [inaudible] 

A: See, if -- if you have no job 
-- after the war, my husband got an
 assignme nt in Indonesia. So 
we went there for a year, and that was becausethat airline, Kahouda Indonesian Airline, was 

supposed to be independent from the KLM, 
that™s the Dutch company airline. But the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
61 
 
 
governme nt did not like the idea th
at we were living, so we had a 
notice of 14 days to scram, get 
out. And I was just ma rried, so all my  wedding pr
esents I could not pack, was too ma ny. You -- 
you only had the opportunity to pack what you could 
carry, so that was all behind, so they had a 
ball, perhaps with that stuff. The house was empt
y. We  were just literally refugees. So then you 
come  to the -- to the Netherlands, and you have 
no home , so you are supposed to live with your 
in-laws, and that -- I just expl
ained my father-in-law was, with
 the Japs hanging -- oh, that was 
hell. So we tried as soon as we
 could ma nage, to immigrate. Bu
t, you stay on -- on -- on a list. 
You need to find your own sponsor, no help with 
that. So we kept looking in newspapers for 
immi gration, and we found a sponsor. Then you need
 money in order to pay for the trip. We  had 
that. I -- I -- I worked undergr
ound, too. I was not allowed to work, 
but I did. And then finally, in 
1953, we got permission, and we left at April th
e sixth, after we had th
at big flood, on January 
the 31
st
, that all the dikes were flooded over. I don
™t know if you me mber -- reme mber that -- I 
have also a book about that. So, th
e south part of Holland was absolute water. Wa ter, water, all 
over, and 2,000 people had drowned. Cows, horses,
 everyt hing was floating, because they had 
drowned. It was me ss. So, we came here in April, and my son was six. Had not learned a word of 
English, because he is just like 
me . That stupid language, I don™t 
want to learn that. Now, that 
was in Holland, so we come  here, and we have a fa
mily from the state department, and they have 
Black people, real southern Virginian type. And 
I was supposed to sit with that Black woma n. So 
what?  I said to the lady, ﬁ What 
big fuss about it? Who cares? She is nice.ﬂ And then the Black 
woma n says, ﬁYou are more educated than my own bo
ss.ﬂ I told her that, I said, ﬁI dress better, I 
have better manners, I™m polite, and I -- I have mo
re respect for Black pe ople than you do.ﬂ That 
woma n was flabbergasted. She sa
id, ﬁ Where did you learn that? ﬂ
 I said, ﬁWell, I just, you know, 
have my ears open.ﬂ But when you was at work, 
I -- I -- I got someone at the door, and I opened 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461  
62 
 
 
the door, ﬁAre you Mrs. Gardner? ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, 
I™m the housekeeper.ﬂ ﬁOh, you look much better 
than she does.ﬂ Now, I didn™t know that guy, he just
 knocked at the door, so I me an, a -- a -- a -- 
a -- I already found a lot of things
 out. And then I found out they were Democrats, so I™m an -- 
I™m a Republican.  
Q: But you needed a roof over your head. 

A: But my son -- April, May, June, July, August, 
September, learned perfect Virginian slang. So 
he came in the first grade. Then we had a PTA m
eeting, and that teacher of that class come s to 
me . ﬁI heard that you was from Holland. How come  your son speaks perfect English?ﬂ I said, 

ﬁSo do I.ﬂ She was so impressed, she said, ﬁOh, th
at is so cute, he speaks so good Virginian.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁWell, it™s because he was forced to. In Ho
lland, he refused to learn that.ﬂ She said, ﬁI 
cannot believe that.ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, that™s what
 he said.ﬂ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. So then -- then he 
was at school here, and the -- both sons, I said, 
ﬁIf you are in the door, in the house, it™s only 
Dutch spoken. You leave the house, then you can 
speak all the English you want.ﬂ So my 
youngest became a pilot, he goes to Amsterdam 
for three days. ﬁAre you American? ﬂ  ﬁYeah,ﬂ 
said my son. ﬁBut you speak Dutch.ﬂ ﬁSo wh
at?  My mother taught -- told me . She is a 
[inaudible].ﬂ Of course, he didn™t 
dare to say that, but I mean, th
at -- that was what they thought 
in the -- in Holland, because he spoke flue
ntly Dutch. And it didn™t cost him a penny. 
Q: That™s really important.  

A: And that™s with my oldest son also, if 
we have a secret language, we speak Dutch. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: If I get a -- a -- a salesp
erson over the telephone, I speak 
Dutch. I had once a guy who spoke 
Japanese, so I spoke Dutch, and I heard him sayi
ng some thing bad in Japanese, but he hang up.

nt to go back to the last few months  of the 
war, d -- were you beginning to expect a libe
ration?  We re you beginning 
to hear that it was 
happening in other places? 
A: We  had a ma p with pins, and 
listening to the BBC, we changed 
the pins where they lost. So 
we knew, looking at the pins, that th
ey lost this part, they lost th
at part, they lo
st Poland, they -- 
they lost Danzig. The Russians were killing them 
in the east of -- of Ger many. In Belgium were 
certain battles lost. The battle of Arnhem, you se
e the -- you saw ma ybe in the movies about that. 
So we -- we didn™t have to notice it, you just 
looked, or listened, and 
that is how you got the 
nerve to do some  certain things that you didn™t da
re to do. And that is why we knew that wi -- 
they were, you know, sent to th-the west coast, that is [indecipherable], and that was the -- the 

area where the underground had the -- 
settled, and there they had to 
leave all their fur coats that 
they were snatching, and -- and radios, and whatev
er. All -- all the luxury 
stuff that was stolen, 
they had to leave it there. And they are -- they we
re -- I think, but I -- I ca
nnot be sure about it, 
stripped from all their whatever, paraphernalia, 
on their arms, because of ranks, and stuff. So 
they walked for two or three hours,
 to their country, as 
a private. You didn™t 
notice if a colonel, 
whatever. We just got them s -- so fa r down that
 they were not looking us in the face any more. 
Q: Right. 

A: And that is why we also snapped those girl
s that we knew had dated. And we put them on a 
table, and that™s all facts, it™s not that I invent  th
at -- on the tabl e, with a 
razor here, and razed off, 
fell on the floor. Other young people of my age thre
w toma toes in their faces, rotten eggs. We  
saved it all up for that purpose. And then, of c
ourse, they were also -- I don™t  know, I was not 
there to -- to witness that. Ca
use what happened after that, I d
on™t know, if they were molested, 
or -- or raped, or -- I -- 
I just don™t know that.

Q: Oh, you weren™t there when that happened? 
A: No, no, no, no. Because, as I told
 you, I was still a nurse. I was stil
l in the hospital, and what I 
know is either from newspaper news, or in -- in 
-- in the radio at the time, then you had the nerve 

to listen to your own radio. Bu
t see, the radio was still German mi nded, so it was not the way 

that you could believe it. But when the radio be
came  Dutch again, that was where you listened 
to, and that was honest.  

Q: A couple days later, after that happened to 
those girls, did you ever 
see any girls with their 
heads shaven? 

A: No, no. Oh, I saw that -- 

Q: Heads shaved -- 

A: Oh, I saw that on pictures. 

Q: Okay. 

A: As I told you, you went to the mo vies to wa
tch the news, and that is why I thought Hodsen 
looks funny, but she had no hair, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. 

Q: What -- what other kinds of things like th
at happened to people who had collaborated in a 
sense, with the Germans? 

A: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. We ll, you got punished. Bu
t see, I was co -- not connected with 
those, so they -- they to me  we
re like rotten apples. You don™t talk to them, you don™t want to see 
them. You have no interest in what -- what ha
ppened to them. But you 
find it out from either 
news, but you don™t -- you know, that -- that you ju
st happen to see, and then you are surprised. 
[indecipherable] is that -- is th
at the Dutch way to do things, with
 the -- offi cially it was. Dutch 
people are not angels, either. They are nasty.  

Q: And so, within the period of how ma ny da
ys w-w-was the city empty of Ger mans ?

A: That is ha rd to tell, because also, that wa s gradually. See, a Dutch person does not want to 
ma ke a big deal about some  event. It™s all 
hush-hush, and underground. So, if they were picked 
up, I think their uniforms were st
ripped off first, and they lo
oked like a normal person again. 
That is what happened. So, if you 
meet a person, then you have no su
spicion that -- that is not a 
Dutch person, but he mi ght be a German. B
ecause he doesn™t talk, you don™t know. Because 
Germans and -- and -- and -- and Dutch people look very mu ch the same . You look Dutch too. 

No, really. I mean, that™s the wa
y it is. They™re all blonde, and they
 have the same  expressions, 
rosy cheeks, and even the way they walk is the same. 

Q: Intere sting. 

A: I -- I know the difference between some one -- so
me one from Asia, or some one from the mi dst 
of Europe, and I -- I always ser -- say here
, if some one complains, ﬁWhy don™t you visit 
Kosovo? ﬂ Then you get a better opinion. I hate 
that, you know, people complaining because the 
weather is lousy, or whatever. D
on™t complain. Go as a volunteer
, and help there. That™s my 
answer. And w -- that -- that is what I hope that
 the governme nt finally will change, and do that, 
too, because there is a -- a need 
so badly, and -- and there is a n
eed for -- for peace be tween those 
Arabs. I said to an Arab once, b
ecause I still talk with
 all -- all kinds of re
ligions, ﬁWhy is it that 
-- that wome n are treated so lousy in your count
ry?  They -- they have a veil, they cannot be 
seen.ﬂ I said, ﬁIf I was in your country, the heck
 with you. I come  the way I am, and if you want 
to arrest me , I don™t even go to your country. So if
 you want to ma ke friends, be norma l, be -- be 
the time  of what we live, 2000. You don™t live in th
e Bible years. It ma kes sense.ﬂ I said, ﬁ What -
- what rights do you have with your beard, and 
your funny little thing ove
r here to say those 
things?  Because you happen to be an Arab?  I have 
no respect for that. I have respect if you treat 
your wife in the way she should be treated, and otherwise, bye.ﬂ

Q: Tell us how you were actually liberated. 
A: I was having my shift finished, and I hear a 
lot of commoti on, and I he
ar tanks coming in, and 
I run outside, because I ha ve been told that you c
ould sit on one of those. No dice, they were 

already full. Oh, it was hysterical funny. But you 
walked beside them, and you threw whatever 
you could threw at them, and -- and say in Englis
h -- I was an interprete
r then, too, ﬁOh, we are 
so happy to see you. You have not the slightest idea.
ﬂ ﬁOh yeah,ﬂ said one soldier, very casual, 
ﬁwhat do you think we™re doing here now? ﬂ  I sa
id, ﬁOh, I think you call 
that liberation.ﬂ  
Q: What kind of soldiers were they? 

A: They were Palestinian. But see, in those days
, they were on the Bri
tish thing, so -- yeah, and 
Canadians, that™s why I have that book. Because th
ey ask me  to become  a me mber, that was also 
one of those big honor things. And I was -- oh, I ha
d every week a different boyfriend. I had a -- 

a sergeant, I had a lieutenant colonel. But the f
unny thing is, they all were very much in -- like 
the -- the sergeant, I could not go 
to a party, if that party was not
hing but lieutenants, because of 
his rank. So I had once that I ma de a blunder, and 
I -- I took him to one of those parties, and he 

was hiding under the table, because he  couldn™t show hi mself. And then he was so -- so feeling 

bad, he drank, drank, drank, so he was loaded, he
 -- he -- he couldn™t talk any more, s o I 

reme mber I took him under the armp it, and like a 
sled, I got him outside the door, in the street, 
and then he woke up because of the cold. And th
e other boyfriend, the lieutenant, ye lled at me , 
what are you doing with that bum?  I said, ﬁWell, 
he needs fresh air.ﬂ See, I -- I was the type, I 
didn™t care less if he was a sergeant
, or a private, or a lieutenant, 
because I™m a baroness, I have a 
title. So I don™t have to feel like, you know, 
act like a snob, because I was a snob by birth. 
Q: And that™s the first time 
you™ve mentioned it all day.

A: Yeah, but can you help it? When I came here, I 
had to renounce it in the court. I said to the 
judge, ﬁWha t a waste of time .ﬂ And he looked at
 me  like, ﬁ What did you say? ﬂ I said, ﬁIf you are 
born a baroness, you can tell me  to renounce it,
 and I say you™re a ni
ce judge, but I cannot 
renounce myself, I am born that way.ﬂ So then 
he w -- he -- he thought
, ﬁYeah, she makes a lot 
of sense.ﬂ So he laughed. He said, ﬁYou™re 
funny.ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah, I know I™m funny.ﬂ But the 
other person, she was a baroness from -- I think 
it was Denmark. Yeah. She i -- she is from a 
fa mous Danish -- of course, we know all -- all -- like in England, who is duke, and who is lord, 

and whatever. My uncle was with the House of 
Lords, so y-you know you brought up in that, and 
you don't know any better. So, she was a baroness
 -- what™s that again, and -- and she poked me . 
She said, ﬁDo you talk like that all the time? ﬂ I 
said, ﬁYeah, that™s the way I am.ﬂ Because she 
was brought up very stiff, you know, don™t talk, d
on™t talk. But her husband was American. And 
so he said, ﬁYeah, I can understand.ﬂ What -- what
ever happens in the court is not always, you 
know. We ll, they think it is, but 
it doesn™t ma ke sense. What™s the point, you go to court, and 
renounce your own title? It™s so stupid, because y
ou cannot do anything with it. It doesn™t cost 
any money. It doesn™t hurt
 anybody. It™s just a name . 

Q: How -- how much of this 
story do your children know? 
A: Nothing.  

Q: Really? 

A: I don™t even start. They don™t want to hear it. N
o, they don™t want to hear 
it. They -- it™s -- it is 
just a generation that feels it is
 not concerning them. They are not
 interested, they have their -- 
their own soccer team, and whatev
er. They™re very occupied. My -- my son is now a coach for -- 
for a soccer team, and they played with a Dutch soccer team from the e mbassy. Oh boy, he is so 

-- so that -- that is big deal, and I feel if you 
are together, it should be ha
ppy, and because of that

oc-occasion, and if they want to
 know, they can ask. But they ne
ver do. And I feel well, that™s 
their tough luck, they don™t know what they 
are mi ssing. But ma ybe it™s good, cause it™s nothing 
but sad, sad, sad. And they don™t like me  to be very
 -- how shall I put it, w
ith -- with a -- with a 
face like suffering and stuff, because that™s not 
the way we are. We  are all happy. And I keep it 
that way. And what was happened in the past, 
it happened in the past. I live with that.  
Q: Is there some thing else you wanted to me ntion before we [indecipherable] 
A: Oh boy, I have not the slightest idea. I mi
ght later, but at this time, I don™t know.
